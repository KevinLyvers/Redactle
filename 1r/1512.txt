1580, this, was, the, first, english, circumnavigation, and, second, circumnavigation, overall, he, is, also, known, for, participating, in, the, early, english, slaving, voyages, of, his, cousin, sir, john, hawkins, and, john, lovell, having, started, as, a, simple, seaman, in, 1588, he, was, part, of, the, fight, against, the, spanish, armada, as, a, vice, admiral, at, an, early, age, drake, was, placed, into, the, household, of, a, relative, william, hawkins, a, prominent, sea, captain, in, plymouth, in, 1572, he, set, sail, on, his, first, independent, mission, privateering, along, the, spanish, main, drake, s, circumnavigation, began, on, 15, december, 1577, he, crossed, the, pacific, ocean, until, then, an, area, of, exclusive, spanish, interest, and, laid, claim, to, new, albion, plundering, coastal, towns, and, ships, for, treasure, and, supplies, as, he, went, he, arrived, back, in, england, on, 26, september, 1580, elizabeth, i, awarded, drake, a, knighthood, in, 1581, which, he, received, aboard, his, galleon, the, golden, hind, drake, s, circumnavigation, inaugurated, an, era, of, conflict, with, the, spanish, and, in, 1585, the, anglo, spanish, war, began, drake, was, in, command, of, an, expedition, to, the, americas, that, attacked, spanish, shipping, and, ports, when, philip, ii, sent, the, spanish, armada, to, england, in, 1588, as, a, precursor, to, its, invasion, drake, was, second, in, command, of, the, english, fleet, that, fought, against, and, repulsed, the, spanish, fleet, a, year, later, he, led, the, english, armada, in, a, failed, attempt, to, destroy, the, remaining, spanish, fleet, drake, was, the, member, of, parliament, mp, for, three, constituencies, camelford, in, 1581, bossiney, in, 1584, and, plymouth, in, 1593, drake, s, exploits, made, him, a, hero, to, the, english, but, his, privateering, led, the, spanish, to, brand, him, a, pirate, known, to, them, as, el, draque, the, dragon, in, old, spanish, he, died, of, dysentery, after, his, failed, assault, on, panama, in, january, 1596, francis, drake, was, born, at, crowndale, farm, in, tavistock, devon, england, his, birth, date, is, not, formally, recorded, such, writers, as, e, f, benson, have, claimed, that, he, was, born, while, the, six, articles, of, 1539, were, in, force, but, british, naval, historian, julian, corbett, writing, of, william, camden, s, account, on, which, this, information, is, based, writes, that, as, a, slip, of, memory, too, we, must, put, down, his, difficult, assertion, that, edmund, drake, was, driven, from, devonshire, during, a, persecution, under, the, six, articles, act, of, 1539, his, birth, date, is, estimated, from, the, wording, of, texts, in, contemporary, sources, such, as, drake, was, two, and, twenty, when, he, obtained, the, command, of, the, judith, 1566, this, would, date, his, birth, to, 1544, a, date, of, c, 1540, is, suggested, from, two, portraits, one, a, miniature, painted, by, nicholas, hilliard, in, 1581, when, he, was, allegedly, 42, which, would, place, his, birth, c, 1539, while, the, other, painted, in, 1594, when, he, was, said, to, be, 52, would, give, a, birth, year, of, c, 1541, he, was, the, eldest, of, the, twelve, sons, of, edmund, drake, 1518, 1585, a, protestant, farmer, and, his, wife, mary, mylwaye, the, first, son, was, said, to, have, been, named, after, his, godfather, francis, russell, 2nd, earl, of, bedford, due, to, religious, persecution, during, the, prayer, book, rebellion, in, 1549, the, drake, family, fled, from, devon, to, kent, there, drake, s, father, obtained, an, appointment, to, minister, to, the, men, in, the, king, s, navy, he, was, ordained, deacon, and, was, made, vicar, of, upchurch, church, on, the, medway, at, an, early, age, drake, was, placed, into, the, household, of, a, relative, sea, captain, william, hawkins, of, plymouth, and, began, his, seagoing, training, as, an, apprentice, on, hawkins, boats, by, 18, he, was, a, purser, according, to, the, english, chronicler, edmund, howes, and, in, the, 1550s, drake, s, father, found, the, young, man, a, position, with, the, owner, and, master, of, a, small, barque, one, of, the, small, traders, plying, between, the, medway, river, and, the, dutch, coast, drake, likely, engaged, in, commerce, along, the, coast, of, england, the, low, countries, and, france, the, ship, s, master, was, so, satisfied, with, the, young, drake, s, conduct, that, being, unmarried, and, childless, at, his, death, he, bequeathed, the, barque, to, drake, in, 1562, the, west, african, slave, trade, was, a, duopoly, dominated, by, the, portuguese, and, the, spanish, sir, john, hawkins, devised, a, plan, to, break, into, that, trade, and, enlisted, the, aid, of, colleagues, and, family, to, finance, his, first, slave, voyage, drake, was, not, part, of, that, group, of, financiers, though, his, presence, as, one, of, hundreds, of, seamen, on, hawkins, s, first, two, slaving, voyages, has, been, assumed, there, is, some, anecdotal, evidence, to, support, drake, serving, as, a, common, seaman, on, the, first, two, voyages, and, good, evidence, of, his, presence, for, the, last, two, of, four, slaving, voyages, made, by, hawkins, ships, between, 1562, and, 1569, in, 1562, hawkins, sailed, to, the, coast, of, the, sierra, leone, seized, portuguese, slave, ships, and, sold, the, africans, in, the, spanish, indies, it, was, highly, profitable, so, for, his, second, slave, voyage, in, 1564, hawkins, gained, queen, elizabeth, i, s, support, she, lent, him, one, of, her, ships, jesus, of, l, beck, which, served, as, his, flagship, hawkins, attacked, an, african, native, town, and, sold, many, of, its, inhabitants, in, spanish, ports, on, the, caribbean, mainland, making, another, large, profit, for, himself, the, queen, and, the, consortium, of, investors, from, her, court, sources, vary, on, the, dates, and, the, age, of, drake, at, the, time, harry, kelsey, says, he, was, twenty, years, old, ccording, to, howes, in, reference, to, the, english, chronicler, edmund, howes, writing, in, 1615, drake, was, not, a, member, of, that, consortium, but, the, crew, would, have, received, a, small, share, of, the, profits, based, on, this, association, scholar, kris, lane, lists, drake, as, one, of, the, first, english, slave, traders, the, spanish, and, portuguese, were, aggrieved, that, the, english, had, entered, into, the, slave, trade, and, were, selling, slaves, to, their, colonies, despite, being, forbidden, from, doing, so, queen, elizabeth, i, under, pressure, to, avoid, an, armed, conflict, forbade, hawkins, from, going, to, sea, for, a, third, slave, voyage, in, response, he, set, up, a, slave, voyage, with, a, relative, john, lovell, in, command, in, 1566, drake, accompanied, lovell, on, this, voyage, the, voyage, was, unsuccessful, as, more, than, 90, enslaved, africans, were, released, without, payment, in, 1567, drake, accompanied, hawkins, on, their, next, and, last, joint, voyage, the, crew, attempted, to, capture, slaves, around, cape, verde, but, failed, hawkins, allied, himself, with, two, local, kings, in, sierra, leone, who, asked, for, help, against, their, enemies, in, exchange, for, half, of, any, captives, they, took, attacking, from, both, sides, they, took, several, hundred, prisoners, though, kelsey, says, the, kings, kept, the, larger, share, of, slaves, and, dared, hawkins, to, do, anything, about, it, events, worsened, for, the, fleet, as, it, faced, storms, spanish, hostility, armed, conflict, and, finally, a, hurricane, that, separated, one, ship, from, the, rest, and, it, had, to, find, its, own, way, home, the, remaining, ships, were, forced, into, the, port, of, san, juan, de, ul, a, near, vera, cruz, so, they, could, make, repairs, soon, afterward, the, newly, appointed, viceroy, of, new, spain, mart, n, enr, quez, de, almanza, arrived, with, a, fleet, of, ships, while, still, negotiating, to, resupply, and, repair, hawkins, ships, were, attacked, by, the, spanish, ships, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, san, juan, de, ul, a, the, battle, ended, in, an, english, defeat, with, all, but, two, of, the, english, ships, lost, the, spanish, launched, a, fireship, against, hawkins, flagship, jesus, of, l, beck, and, the, crew, of, minion, in, panic, and, fear, cut, the, lines, securing, them, to, jesus, hawkins, was, among, those, who, jumped, from, the, flagship, s, bulwarks, to, minion, s, decks, drake, by, this, time, the, captain, of, judith, fled, leaving, hawkins, behind, hawkins, escaped, on, minion, and, limped, back, to, england, with, dozens, of, his, men, dying, along, the, way, and, arriving, with, a, crew, of, just, 15, hundreds, of, english, seamen, were, abandoned, after, arriving, back, in, england, hawkins, accused, drake, of, desertion, and, of, stealing, the, treasure, they, had, accumulated, drake, denied, both, accusations, asserting, he, had, distributed, all, profits, among, the, crew, and, that, he, had, believed, hawkins, was, lost, when, he, left, the, bitter, end, of, the, fourth, voyage, turned, drake, s, life, in, a, different, direction, thereafter, he, would, not, pursue, trading, and, slaving, but, would, instead, dedicate, himself, to, attacking, spanish, possessions, wherever, he, found, them, drake, s, hostility, towards, the, spanish, is, said, to, have, started, with, the, battle, and, its, aftermath, the, voyage, of, 1567, 1569, was, drake, s, last, association, with, slaving, in, total, approximately, 1, 200, africans, were, enslaved, on, these, four, voyages, and, an, estimated, three, times, as, many, africans, were, killed, based, on, the, contemporaneous, accounts, of, slavers, on, the, issue, of, slaving, scholar, john, sugden, writes, that, drake, was, in, his, twenties, and, did, not, question, what, his, elders, accepted, but, must, share, some, culpability, for, his, participation, in, 1572, drake, embarked, on, his, first, major, independent, enterprise, he, planned, an, attack, on, the, isthmus, of, panama, known, to, the, spanish, as, part, of, tierra, firme, and, to, the, english, as, part, of, the, spanish, main, this, was, the, point, at, which, the, silver, and, gold, treasure, of, peru, had, to, be, brought, ashore, and, transported, overland, to, the, caribbean, sea, where, galleons, from, spain, would, take, it, aboard, at, the, town, of, nombre, de, dios, drake, left, plymouth, on, 24, may, 1572, with, a, crew, of, 73, men, in, two, small, vessels, pascha, 70, tons, and, swan, 25, tons, to, capture, nombre, de, dios, drake, s, first, raid, was, late, in, july, 1572, drake, captured, nombre, de, dios, but, he, was, badly, wounded, when, the, spanish, arrived, from, panama, and, his, forces, had, to, retreat, without, the, gold, silver, pearls, and, jewels, stored, in, the, royal, treasury, rather, than, sacking, nombre, de, dios, again, drake, raided, spanish, galleons, along, the, coast, and, with, his, cimarr, n, african, slaves, who, had, escaped, from, their, spanish, owners, allies, looted, the, mule, trains, that, transported, gold, silver, and, trade, goods, from, panama, city, one, of, these, men, was, diego, who, later, became, a, free, man, after, years, of, service, under, drake, among, drake, s, adventures, along, the, spanish, main, his, capture, of, the, spanish, silver, train, at, nombre, de, dios, on, 1, april, 1573, made, him, rich, and, famous, near, cabo, de, cativas, he, encountered, a, french, privateer, guillaume, le, testu, who, was, in, command, of, the, 80, ton, warship, havre, and, joined, forces, with, him, in, a, combined, fleet, drake, had, determined, to, intercept, the, mule, train, at, the, campos, river, two, leagues, from, nombre, de, dios, and, instructed, the, captains, of, his, pinnaces, to, meet, them, at, the, francisca, river, on, 3, april, to, carry, them, off, after, the, raid, the, combined, english, and, french, raiding, parties, marched, through, the, forest, towards, the, trail, to, within, a, mile, of, the, city, while, the, cimarr, ns, performed, reconnaissance, the, next, morning, 1, april, they, surprised, the, mule, convoy, and, seized, more, than, 200, 000, pesos, worth, of, treasure, after, their, attack, on, the, richly, laden, mule, train, drake, and, his, party, found, that, they, had, captured, around, 20, tons, of, silver, and, gold, they, buried, much, of, the, treasure, as, it, was, too, much, for, their, party, to, carry, and, made, off, with, a, fortune, in, gold, an, account, of, this, may, have, given, rise, to, subsequent, stories, of, pirates, and, buried, treasure, badly, wounded, le, testu, was, captured, and, beheaded, the, small, band, of, adventurers, dragged, as, much, gold, and, silver, as, they, could, carry, back, across, some, 18, miles, 29, km, of, jungle, covered, mountains, to, where, they, had, left, the, raiding, boats, when, they, got, to, the, coast, the, boats, were, gone, drake, and, his, men, downhearted, exhausted, and, hungry, had, nowhere, to, go, and, the, spanish, were, not, far, behind, at, this, point, drake, rallied, his, men, buried, the, treasure, on, the, beach, and, built, a, raft, to, sail, in, a, heavy, swell, with, four, men, twelve, miles, along, the, coast, to, where, they, had, left, two, pinnaces, when, drake, finally, reached, them, his, men, were, alarmed, at, his, bedraggled, appearance, fearing, the, worst, they, asked, him, how, the, raid, had, gone, drake, could, not, resist, a, joke, and, teased, them, by, looking, downhearted, then, he, laughed, pulled, a, quoit, of, spanish, gold, from, his, clothes, and, said, our, voyage, is, made, by, the, second, week, of, august, 1573, he, had, returned, to, plymouth, it, was, during, this, expedition, that, on, 11, february, drake, and, his, lieutenant, john, oxenham, climbed, a, high, tree, in, the, central, mountains, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, thus, became, the, first, englishmen, to, see, the, pacific, ocean, mirroring, the, achievement, of, the, spaniard, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, in, 1513, the, cimarr, ns, had, cut, steps, into, its, trunk, on, which, drake, and, the, cimarr, n, leader, pedro, ascended, to, a, platform, at, the, top, of, the, giant, tree, where, they, were, joined, by, oxenham, the, englishmen, vowed, when, they, saw, the, pacific, ocean, that, one, day, they, would, sail, its, waters, which, drake, would, do, years, later, as, part, of, his, circumnavigation, of, the, world, when, drake, returned, to, plymouth, after, the, raids, the, government, signed, a, temporary, truce, with, king, philip, ii, of, spain, and, so, was, unable, to, acknowledge, drake, s, accomplishment, officially, drake, was, considered, a, hero, in, england, and, a, pirate, in, spain, for, his, raids, drake, was, present, at, the, 1575, rathlin, island, massacre, in, ireland, sir, john, norris, or, norreys, and, drake, acting, on, the, instructions, of, sir, henry, sidney, and, the, earl, of, essex, robert, devereux, laid, siege, to, rathlin, castle, despite, its, surrender, norris, troops, killed, all, the, 200, defenders, and, several, hundred, more, men, women, and, children, of, clan, macdonnell, meanwhile, drake, was, given, the, task, of, preventing, any, gaelic, irish, or, scottish, reinforcements, reaching, the, island, therefore, the, remaining, leader, of, the, gaelic, defence, against, english, power, sorley, boy, macdonnell, was, forced, to, stay, on, the, mainland, essex, wrote, in, his, letter, to, queen, elizabeth, s, secretary, that, following, the, attack, sorley, boy, was, likely, to, have, run, mad, for, sorrow, tearing, and, tormenting, himself, and, saying, that, he, there, lost, all, that, he, ever, had, following, the, success, of, the, panama, isthmus, raid, drake, s, so, called, famous, voyage, an, expedition, against, the, spanish, along, the, pacific, coast, of, the, americas, was, organized, and, financed, by, a, private, syndicate, that, included, francis, walsingham, robert, dudley, 1st, earl, of, leicester, john, hawkins, christopher, hatton, and, drake, himself, drake, acted, on, the, plan, authored, by, sir, richard, grenville, who, in, 1574, had, received, a, royal, patent, for, that, purpose, just, a, year, later, this, patent, had, been, rescinded, after, elizabeth, i, learned, of, grenville, s, intentions, against, the, spanish, elizabeth, likely, invested, in, drake, s, voyage, to, south, america, in, 1577, but, never, issued, him, a, formal, commission, this, would, be, the, first, circumnavigation, in, 58, years, diego, was, once, again, employed, under, drake, his, fluency, in, spanish, and, english, would, make, him, a, useful, interpreter, when, spaniards, or, spanish, speaking, portuguese, were, captured, he, was, employed, as, drake, s, servant, and, was, paid, wages, like, the, rest, of, the, crew, drake, and, the, fleet, set, out, from, plymouth, on, 15, november, 1577, but, bad, weather, threatened, him, and, his, fleet, they, were, forced, to, take, refuge, in, falmouth, cornwall, from, where, they, returned, to, plymouth, for, repair, after, this, major, setback, drake, set, sail, again, on, 13, december, aboard, pelican, with, four, other, ships, and, 164, men, he, soon, added, a, sixth, ship, mary, formerly, santa, mar, a, a, portuguese, merchant, ship, that, had, been, captured, off, the, coast, of, africa, near, the, cape, verde, islands, he, also, kidnapped, its, captain, nuno, da, silva, a, man, with, considerable, experience, navigating, in, south, american, waters, drake, s, fleet, suffered, great, attrition, he, scuttled, both, christopher, and, the, flyboat, swan, due, to, loss, of, men, on, the, atlantic, crossing, he, made, landfall, at, the, gloomy, bay, of, puerto, san, juli, n, in, what, is, now, argentina, ferdinand, magellan, had, called, there, half, a, century, earlier, where, he, put, to, death, some, mutineers, drake, s, men, saw, weathered, and, bleached, skeletons, on, the, spanish, gibbets, following, magellan, s, example, drake, tried, and, executed, his, own, mutineer, thomas, doughty, the, crew, discovered, that, mary, had, rotting, timbers, so, they, put, the, vessel, ashore, stripped, it, and, abandoned, it, drake, decided, to, remain, the, winter, in, san, juli, n, before, attempting, the, strait, of, magellan, on, his, voyage, to, interfere, with, spanish, treasure, fleets, drake, had, several, quarrels, with, his, co, commander, thomas, doughty, and, on, 3, june, 1578, accused, him, of, witchcraft, and, charged, him, with, mutiny, and, treason, in, a, shipboard, trial, drake, claimed, to, have, a, never, presented, commission, from, the, queen, to, carry, out, such, acts, and, denied, doughty, a, trial, in, england, the, main, pieces, of, evidence, against, doughty, were, the, testimony, of, the, ship, s, carpenter, edward, bright, who, after, the, trial, was, promoted, to, master, of, the, ship, marigold, and, doughty, s, admission, of, telling, lord, burghley, a, vocal, opponent, of, agitating, the, spanish, of, the, intent, of, the, voyage, drake, consented, to, his, request, of, communion, and, dined, with, him, of, which, francis, fletcher, had, this, account, and, after, this, holy, repast, they, dined, also, at, the, same, table, together, as, cheerfully, in, sobriety, as, ever, in, their, lives, they, had, done, aforetime, each, cheering, up, the, other, and, taking, their, leave, by, drinking, each, to, other, as, if, some, journey, only, had, been, in, hand, drake, had, thomas, doughty, beheaded, on, 2, july, 1578, in, january, 1580, when, drake, became, stranded, upon, a, reef, off, the, celebes, sea, the, ship, s, chaplain, francis, fletcher, in, a, sermon, suggested, that, the, woes, of, the, voyage, were, connected, to, the, unjust, demise, of, doughty, drake, chained, the, clergyman, to, a, hatch, cover, and, pronounced, him, excommunicated, the, three, remaining, ships, of, his, convoy, departed, for, the, magellan, strait, at, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, a, few, weeks, later, in, september, 1578, drake, made, it, to, the, pacific, but, violent, storms, destroyed, one, of, the, three, ships, marigold, captained, by, john, thomas, in, the, strait, and, caused, another, elizabeth, captained, by, john, wynter, to, return, to, england, leaving, only, pelican, after, this, passage, pelican, was, pushed, south, and, discovered, an, island, that, drake, called, elizabeth, island, drake, like, navigators, before, him, probably, reached, a, latitude, of, 55, s, according, to, astronomical, data, quoted, in, richard, hakluyt, s, the, principall, navigations, voiages, and, discoveries, of, the, english, nation, of, 1589, along, the, chilean, coast, in, the, magellan, strait, francis, and, his, men, engaged, in, skirmishes, with, local, indigenous, people, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, kill, indigenous, peoples, in, southern, patagonia, during, their, stay, in, the, strait, crew, members, discovered, that, an, infusion, made, of, the, bark, of, drimys, winteri, could, be, used, as, remedy, against, scurvy, captain, wynter, ordered, the, collection, of, great, amounts, of, bark, hence, the, scientific, name, historian, mateo, martinic, who, examined, records, of, drake, s, travels, credits, him, with, the, discovery, of, the, southern, end, of, the, americas, and, the, oceanic, space, south, of, it, the, first, report, of, his, discovery, of, an, open, channel, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, was, written, after, the, 1618, publication, of, the, voyage, of, willem, schouten, and, jacob, le, maire, around, cape, horn, in, 1616, drake, pushed, onwards, in, his, lone, flagship, now, renamed, golden, hind, in, honour, of, sir, christopher, hatton, after, his, coat, of, arms, golden, hind, sailed, north, along, the, pacific, coast, of, south, america, attacking, spanish, ports, and, pillaging, towns, some, spanish, ships, were, captured, and, drake, used, their, more, accurate, charts, to, inform, his, navigation, before, reaching, the, coast, of, peru, drake, visited, mocha, island, off, the, coast, of, what, is, now, chile, where, he, and, his, manservant, diego, were, seriously, injured, by, hostile, mapuche, who, shot, them, with, arrows, later, he, sacked, the, port, of, valpara, so, further, north, in, chile, where, he, also, captured, a, ship, full, of, chilean, wine, near, lima, drake, captured, a, spanish, ship, with, 25, 000, pesos, of, peruvian, gold, amounting, in, value, to, 37, 000, ducats, of, spanish, money, about, 7m, by, modern, standards, drake, also, discovered, news, of, another, ship, nuestra, se, ora, de, la, concepci, n, which, was, sailing, west, towards, manila, it, would, come, to, be, called, cacafuego, drake, gave, chase, and, eventually, captured, the, treasure, ship, which, proved, his, most, profitable, capture, aboard, nuestra, se, ora, de, la, concepci, n, drake, found, 36, kilograms, 80, lb, of, gold, a, golden, crucifix, jewels, 13, chests, of, silver, reals, and, 26, 000, kilograms, 26, long, tons, of, silver, drake, was, naturally, pleased, at, his, good, luck, in, capturing, the, galleon, and, he, showed, it, by, dining, with, the, captured, ship, s, officers, and, gentleman, passengers, he, offloaded, his, captives, a, short, time, later, and, gave, each, one, gifts, appropriate, to, their, rank, as, well, as, a, letter, of, safe, conduct, drake, continued, north, raiding, more, spanish, settlements, and, ships, as, he, went, his, last, stop, in, this, phase, of, the, voyage, was, in, the, town, of, guatulco, where, he, and, his, crew, stayed, from, 13, to, 16, april, looting, provisions, and, other, materials, from, here, drake, began, to, consider, how, best, to, return, to, england, one, possibility, was, to, sail, back, south, along, the, spanish, coast, and, return, to, the, atlantic, ocean, via, the, strait, of, magellan, or, possibly, cape, horn, this, route, was, ruled, out, however, to, avoid, the, dangerous, weather, near, the, strait, and, presumed, spanish, resistance, all, along, the, coast, this, left, two, possible, routes, continue, north, up, the, american, coast, and, return, to, the, atlantic, by, the, rumored, strait, of, ani, n, or, sail, across, the, pacific, making, for, the, east, indies, and, from, there, return, to, england, by, completing, a, circumnavigation, of, the, world, in, may, drake, s, two, ships, passed, the, baja, california, peninsula, and, continued, north, prior, to, drake, s, voyage, the, western, coast, of, north, america, had, only, been, partially, explored, in, 1542, by, juan, rodr, guez, cabrillo, who, sailed, for, spain, so, intending, to, avoid, further, conflict, with, spain, drake, navigated, north, west, of, spanish, presence, and, sought, a, discreet, site, at, which, the, crew, could, prepare, for, the, journey, back, to, england, the, northernmost, extent, of, this, leg, of, the, expedition, has, been, the, subject, of, much, scholarly, debate, but, most, sources, agree, that, drake, reached, a, latitude, of, at, least, 48, north, before, turning, back, and, heading, south, on, 5, june, 1579, the, ship, briefly, made, first, landfall, at, what, is, now, south, cove, cape, arago, just, south, of, coos, bay, oregon, and, then, sailed, southward, on, 17, june, drake, and, his, crew, found, a, protected, cove, when, they, landed, on, the, pacific, coast, of, what, is, now, northern, california, while, ashore, he, claimed, the, area, for, queen, elizabeth, i, as, nova, albion, or, new, albion, to, document, and, assert, his, claim, drake, posted, an, engraved, plate, of, brass, to, claim, sovereignty, for, elizabeth, and, every, successive, english, monarch, after, erecting, a, fort, and, tents, ashore, the, crew, laboured, for, several, weeks, as, they, prepared, for, the, circumnavigating, voyage, ahead, by, careening, their, ship, golden, hind, to, effectively, clean, and, repair, the, hull, drake, had, friendly, interactions, with, the, coast, miwok, and, explored, the, surrounding, land, by, foot, when, his, ship, was, ready, for, the, return, voyage, drake, and, the, crew, left, new, albion, on, 23, july, and, paused, the, journey, the, next, day, when, anchoring, the, ship, at, the, farallon, islands, where, they, hunted, sea, lions, or, seals, drake, left, the, pacific, coast, heading, south, west, to, catch, the, winds, that, would, carry, his, ship, across, the, pacific, and, a, few, months, later, reached, the, moluccas, a, group, of, islands, in, the, western, pacific, in, eastern, modern, day, indonesia, harry, kelsey, maintains, against, scholarly, consensus, that, because, of, the, contrary, prevailing, winds, and, currents, it, is, much, more, probable, that, drake, careened, his, ship, on, the, shore, of, magdalena, bay, in, lower, california, and, sailed, to, the, moluccas, and, spice, islands, from, there, at, this, time, diego, died, from, wounds, he, had, sustained, earlier, in, the, voyage, golden, hind, later, became, caught, on, a, reef, and, was, almost, lost, afterwards, the, sailors, waited, three, days, for, convenient, tides, and, had, dumped, cargo, befriending, sultan, babullah, of, ternate, in, the, moluccas, drake, and, his, men, became, involved, in, some, intrigues, with, the, portuguese, there, he, made, multiple, stops, on, his, way, toward, the, tip, of, africa, eventually, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, reached, sierra, leone, by, 22, july, 1580, on, 26, september, 1580, golden, hind, sailed, into, plymouth, with, drake, and, 59, remaining, crew, aboard, along, with, a, rich, cargo, of, spices, and, captured, spanish, treasures, the, queen, s, half, share, of, the, cargo, surpassed, the, rest, of, the, crown, s, income, for, that, entire, year, drake, was, hailed, as, the, first, englishman, to, circumnavigate, the, earth, and, his, was, the, second, such, voyage, arriving, with, at, least, one, ship, intact, after, elcano, s, in, 1520, queen, elizabeth, declared, that, all, written, accounts, of, drake, s, voyages, were, to, become, the, queen, s, secrets, of, the, realm, and, drake, and, the, other, participants, of, his, voyages, on, the, pain, of, death, sworn, to, their, secrecy, she, intended, to, keep, drake, s, activities, hidden, from, the, eyes, of, rival, spain, drake, presented, the, queen, with, a, jewel, token, commemorating, the, circumnavigation, taken, as, a, prize, off, the, pacific, coast, of, mexico, it, was, made, of, enamelled, gold, and, bore, an, african, diamond, and, a, ship, with, an, ebony, hull, to, show, her, gratitude, the, queen, gave, him, the, drake, jewel, a, valuable, pendant, surrounded, by, diamonds, rubies, and, pearls, it, was, an, unusual, gift, to, bestow, upon, a, commoner, and, one, that, drake, wore, in, a, 1591, portrait, by, marcus, gheeraerts, on, one, side, of, the, pendant, is, a, state, portrait, of, elizabeth, by, the, miniaturist, nicholas, hilliard, on, the, other, a, sardonyx, cameo, of, double, portrait, busts, a, regal, woman, and, an, african, male, the, drake, jewel, is, a, rare, documented, survivor, among, sixteenth, century, jewels, it, is, conserved, at, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, london, queen, elizabeth, awarded, drake, a, knighthood, aboard, golden, hind, in, deptford, on, 4, april, 1581, the, dubbing, being, performed, by, a, french, diplomat, monsieur, de, marchaumont, who, was, negotiating, for, elizabeth, to, marry, the, king, of, france, s, brother, francis, duke, of, anjou, by, getting, the, french, diplomat, involved, in, the, knighting, elizabeth, was, gaining, the, implicit, political, support, of, the, french, for, drake, s, actions, during, the, victorian, era, in, a, spirit, of, nationalism, the, story, was, promoted, that, elizabeth, i, had, done, the, knighting, after, receiving, his, knighthood, drake, unilaterally, adopted, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, ancient, devon, family, of, drake, of, ash, to, whom, he, claimed, a, distant, but, unspecified, kinship, the, right, to, use, the, arms, was, disputed, in, court, so, queen, elizabeth, awarded, drake, his, own, coat, of, arms, drake, s, heraldic, achievement, and, coat, of, arms, contains, the, motto, sic, parvis, magna, which, means, great, achievements, from, small, beginnings, a, hand, coming, out, of, the, clouds, is, labelled, auxilio, divino, which, means, by, divine, aid, drake, first, became, a, member, of, parliament, for, the, last, session, of, the, 4th, parliament, of, elizabeth, i, on, 16, january, 1581, for, the, constituency, of, camelford, he, did, not, actively, participate, at, this, point, and, on, 17, february, 1581, he, was, granted, leave, of, absence, for, certain, his, necessary, business, in, the, service, of, her, majesty, drake, became, the, mayor, of, plymouth, in, september, 1581, during, his, tenure, he, installed, a, compass, in, the, town, s, hoe, and, passed, a, law, regulating, the, local, pilchard, trade, during, his, term, as, lord, mayor, drake, contracted, to, construct, a, leat, or, canal, to, bring, water, from, the, river, meavy, and, to, build, six, new, gristmills, on, it, from, which, he, derived, a, substantial, profit, drake, became, a, member, of, parliament, again, in, 1584, for, bossiney, on, the, forming, of, the, 5th, parliament, of, elizabeth, i, he, served, the, duration, of, the, parliament, and, was, active, in, issues, regarding, the, navy, fishing, early, american, colonisation, and, issues, related, chiefly, to, devon, he, spent, the, time, covered, by, the, next, two, parliamentary, terms, engaged, in, other, duties, and, an, expedition, to, portugal, he, became, a, member, of, parliament, for, plymouth, in, 1593, he, was, active, in, issues, of, interest, to, plymouth, as, a, whole, but, also, to, emphasise, defence, against, the, spanish, war, broke, out, between, england, and, spain, in, 1585, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, queen, elizabeth, i, through, her, principal, secretary, francis, walsingham, ordered, sir, francis, drake, to, lead, an, expedition, to, attack, the, spanish, colonies, in, a, kind, of, pre, emptive, strike, an, expedition, left, plymouth, in, september, 1585, with, drake, in, command, of, twenty, one, ships, with, 1, 800, soldiers, under, christopher, carleill, he, first, attacked, vigo, in, spain, and, held, the, place, for, two, weeks, ransoming, supplies, he, then, plundered, santiago, in, the, cape, verde, islands, after, which, the, fleet, then, sailed, across, the, atlantic, sacked, the, port, of, santo, domingo, and, captured, the, city, of, cartagena, de, indias, in, present, day, colombia, at, cartagena, drake, released, one, hundred, turkish, slaves, on, 6, june, 1586, during, the, return, leg, of, the, voyage, he, attacked, the, wooden, spanish, fort, at, san, agust, n, in, spanish, florida, and, burnt, the, town, to, the, ground, after, the, raids, he, then, went, on, to, find, sir, walter, raleigh, s, settlement, much, further, north, at, roanoke, which, he, replenished, and, also, took, back, with, him, all, of, the, original, colonists, before, sir, richard, grenville, arrived, with, supplies, and, more, colonists, he, finally, reached, england, on, 22, july, when, he, sailed, into, portsmouth, england, to, a, hero, s, welcome, in, part, to, prevent, future, such, attacks, by, english, and, dutch, privateers, against, spanish, interests, in, the, americas, philip, ii, ordered, a, planned, invasion, of, england, on, 15, march, 1587, drake, accepted, a, new, commission, with, several, purposes, to, disrupt, the, shipping, routes, in, order, to, slow, supplies, from, italy, and, andalucia, to, lisbon, to, trouble, enemy, fleets, that, were, in, their, home, ports, and, to, capture, spanish, ships, laden, with, treasure, drake, was, also, to, confront, and, attack, the, spanish, armada, had, it, already, sailed, for, england, when, arriving, at, c, diz, on, 19, april, drake, found, the, harbour, packed, with, ships, and, supplies, as, the, armada, was, readying, and, waiting, for, a, fair, wind, to, launch, the, fleet, to, attack, in, the, early, hours, of, the, next, day, drake, pressed, his, attack, into, the, inner, harbour, and, inflicted, heavy, damage, claims, of, the, exact, spanish, ship, losses, vary, drake, claimed, he, had, sunk, 39, ships, while, the, spanish, admitted, the, loss, of, only, 24, the, attack, became, known, as, the, singeing, of, the, king, s, beard, and, delayed, the, spanish, invasion, by, a, year, over, the, next, month, drake, patrolled, the, iberian, coasts, between, lisbon, and, cape, st, vincent, intercepting, and, destroying, ships, on, the, spanish, supply, lines, drake, estimated, that, he, had, captured, around, 1, 600, to, 1, 700, tons, of, barrel, staves, enough, to, make, 25, 000, to, 30, 000, barrels, 4, 000, to, 4, 800, m, 3, for, containing, provisions, the, expedition, resulted, in, a, total, profit, for, england, of, around, 140, 000, 18, 235, of, which, went, to, drake, the, spanish, armada, set, sail, for, england, in, may, 1588, and, arrived, on, the, english, coast, on, 29, july, near, cornwall, an, english, fleet, consisting, of, 55, ships, set, out, from, plymouth, to, confront, the, armada, under, the, command, of, lord, howard, of, effingham, with, sir, francis, drake, serving, as, vice, admiral, commanding, from, the, galleon, revenge, as, the, english, fleet, pursued, the, armada, up, the, english, channel, in, closing, darkness, drake, broke, off, and, captured, the, disabled, spanish, galleon, nuestra, se, ora, del, rosario, along, with, admiral, pedro, de, vald, s, and, most, of, his, crew, the, spanish, ship, was, known, to, be, carrying, substantial, funds, to, pay, the, spanish, armada, drake, s, ship, had, been, leading, the, english, pursuit, of, the, armada, by, means, of, a, lantern, by, extinguishing, this, for, the, capture, drake, put, the, english, fleet, into, disarray, overnight, the, duke, of, medina, sidonia, whom, philip, had, appointed, to, command, the, armada, despite, his, complete, lack, of, military, experience, on, land, or, at, sea, made, his, way, up, the, channel, towards, the, french, shore, in, his, flagship, san, mart, n, with, the, english, in, pursuit, thinking, that, if, he, anchored, in, the, roadstead, of, calais, they, would, not, dare, molest, the, spanish, ships, in, french, waters, a, council, of, war, was, held, aboard, howard, s, flagship, ark, where, howard, drake, seymour, hawkins, martin, frobisher, and, two, or, three, others, decided, to, launch, fire, ships, that, night, the, english, launched, eight, fire, ships, into, the, midst, of, the, armada, at, its, moorings, forcing, its, captains, to, cut, their, anchors, and, sail, out, of, calais, into, the, open, sea, the, decisive, action, was, fought, the, next, day, on, the, shoals, off, gravelines, where, frobisher, drake, and, hawkins, pounded, the, spanish, ships, with, their, guns, drake, s, squadron, gave, medina, sidonia, s, flagship, san, martin, a, single, broadside, and, moved, on, frobisher, directly, behind, him, in, the, english, line, stayed, with, the, san, martin, at, close, range, and, poured, cannon, shot, into, her, oaken, flanks, but, failed, to, take, her, five, spanish, ships, were, lost, drake, wrote, as, follows, to, admiral, henry, seymour, after, coming, upon, part, of, the, spanish, armada, whilst, aboard, revenge, on, 31, july, 1588, 21, july, 1588, os, the, 21st, we, had, them, in, chase, and, so, coming, up, unto, them, there, hath, passed, some, cannon, shot, between, some, of, our, fleet, and, some, of, them, and, as, far, as, we, perceive, they, are, determined, to, sell, their, lives, with, blows, the, armada, having, failed, in, their, aim, were, unable, to, sail, back, via, the, english, channel, the, english, ships, including, revenge, pursued, them, to, prevent, any, landing, on, english, soil, although, by, this, time, most, of, howard, s, ships, were, almost, out, of, shot, nevertheless, the, battered, spanish, fleet, were, forced, to, sail, instead, around, the, british, isles, and, encountered, heavy, storms, off, the, coast, of, ireland, the, fleet, eventually, limped, back, to, spanish, ports, having, lost, overall, some, 63, ships, and, vessels, the, most, famous, but, probably, apocryphal, anecdote, about, drake, relates, that, prior, to, the, battle, he, was, playing, a, game, of, bowls, on, plymouth, hoe, on, being, warned, of, the, approach, of, the, spanish, fleet, drake, is, said, to, have, remarked, that, there, was, plenty, of, time, to, finish, the, game, and, still, beat, the, spaniards, perhaps, because, he, was, waiting, for, high, tide, there, is, no, known, eyewitness, account, of, this, incident, and, the, earliest, retelling, of, it, was, printed, 37, years, later, adverse, winds, and, currents, caused, some, delay, in, the, launching, of, the, english, fleet, as, the, spanish, drew, nearer, perhaps, prompting, a, popular, myth, of, drake, s, cavalier, attitude, to, the, spanish, threat, the, people, of, quality, dislike, him, for, having, risen, so, high, from, such, a, lowly, family, the, rest, say, he, is, the, main, cause, of, wars, gonzalo, gonz, lez, del, castillo, letter, to, king, philip, ii, 1592, in, 1589, the, year, after, the, failure, of, the, spanish, armada, the, english, sent, their, own, armada, to, attack, spain, drake, and, norris, were, given, three, tasks, first, to, destroy, the, battered, spanish, atlantic, fleet, which, was, being, repaired, in, ports, of, northern, spain, second, to, make, a, landing, at, lisbon, portugal, and, raise, a, revolt, there, against, king, philip, ii, philip, i, of, portugal, installing, the, pretender, dom, ant, nio, prior, of, crato, to, the, portuguese, throne, and, third, to, take, the, azores, if, possible, so, as, to, establish, a, permanent, base, in, the, siege, of, coru, a, drake, and, norris, destroyed, a, few, ships, in, the, harbour, of, a, coru, a, in, spain, but, were, repelled, this, defeat, in, all, fronts, delayed, drake, for, two, weeks, and, he, was, forced, to, forgo, hunting, the, rest, of, the, surviving, ships, and, head, on, to, lisbon, norris, led, his, army, on, a, difficult, march, over, the, rocky, coast, to, lisbon, while, drake, sailed, around, the, peninsula, to, join, essex, with, his, heavy, artillery, norris, s, troops, were, sick, and, exhausted, by, the, time, they, reached, the, western, limits, of, the, city, consequently, he, demanded, that, dom, ant, nio, raise, provisions, and, men, to, fight, for, his, cause, from, amongst, the, local, populace, or, the, army, would, retreat, drake, against, their, agreed, plans, had, anchored, his, fleet, in, the, mouth, of, the, tagus, estuary, rather, than, running, the, risk, of, sailing, past, the, well, defended, stretches, of, the, tagus, to, bring, the, desperately, needed, heavy, cannon, and, ordnance, the, anticipated, rebellion, never, materialised, and, the, ground, campaign, was, a, total, failure, so, norris, with, his, army, and, ant, nio, re, embarked, to, make, an, attempt, at, capturing, the, treasure, fleet, the, weather, was, not, in, their, favour, so, they, eventually, sailed, for, home, however, drake, wanted, to, atone, for, such, a, bitter, setback, and, in, order, not, to, return, empty, handed, and, with, the, morale, of, his, troops, sunk, he, made, a, fleeting, stop, in, the, galician, r, as, or, coastal, inlets, pillaging, the, defenceless, town, of, vigo, for, two, days, and, razing, it, to, the, ground, this, abusive, demonstration, did, not, leave, the, corsair, unharmed, as, he, lost, hundreds, more, men, on, land, in, addition, to, as, many, as, two, hundred, wounded, the, growing, defences, of, the, inhabitants, and, the, arrivals, of, militias, from, portugal, put, the, ships, in, retreat, again, two, of, the, vessels, sailing, back, to, plymouth, were, captured, in, the, bay, of, biscay, by, a, squadron, of, zabras, led, by, captain, diego, de, aramburu, the, failure, cost, the, lives, of, 11, 000, english, soldiers, and, sailors, according, to, bucholz, and, key, robert, hutchinson, says, between, 8, 000, and, 11, 000, died, while, gorrochategui, santos, calculates, the, number, at, over, 20, 000, upon, his, return, drake, s, behaviour, in, the, expedition, was, increasingly, called, into, question, culminating, in, his, being, charged, by, england, s, privy, council, of, deliberate, failings, and, a, mishandling, of, his, command, despite, never, being, publicly, admonished, on, these, charges, he, nevertheless, fell, out, of, favour, and, was, not, given, command, of, another, naval, expedition, until, 1595, drake, s, seafaring, career, continued, into, his, mid, fifties, in, 1595, he, failed, to, conquer, the, port, of, las, palmas, and, following, a, disastrous, campaign, against, spanish, america, where, he, suffered, a, number, of, defeats, he, unsuccessfully, attacked, san, juan, de, puerto, rico, and, lost, the, battle, of, san, juan, the, spanish, gunners, from, el, morro, castle, shot, a, cannonball, through, his, stateroom, on, the, expedition, s, flagship, but, he, survived, he, and, his, second, in, command, thomas, baskerville, captured, and, burned, nombre, de, dios, and, started, an, overland, crossing, of, the, isthmus, to, attack, the, city, of, panama, but, were, repulsed, by, the, well, entrenched, spaniards, who, had, barricaded, the, road, suffering, heavy, casualties, they, gave, up, the, attempt, a, few, weeks, later, on, 28, january, 1596, drake, died, aged, about, 56, of, dysentery, a, common, disease, at, the, time, while, anchored, off, the, coast, of, portobelo, where, some, spanish, treasure, ships, had, sought, shelter, following, his, death, the, english, fleet, withdrew, defeated, before, dying, he, asked, to, be, dressed, in, his, full, armour, he, was, buried, at, sea, in, a, sealed, lead, lined, coffin, near, portobelo, a, few, miles, off, the, coastline, it, is, supposed, that, his, final, resting, place, is, near, the, wrecks, of, two, british, ships, elizabeth, and, delight, scuttled, in, portobelo, bay, efforts, by, researchers, and, treasure, hunters, to, discover, the, location, of, his, remains, are, ongoing, while, divers, continue, to, search, the, seabed, for, the, coffin, francis, drake, married, mary, newman, at, st, budeaux, church, near, plymouth, on, 4, july, 1569, she, died, about, 24, january, 1583, in, 1585, drake, married, elizabeth, sydenham, born, around, 1562, the, only, child, of, sir, george, sydenham, of, combe, sydenham, who, was, the, high, sheriff, of, somerset, in, 1580, drake, purchased, buckland, abbey, a, large, manor, house, near, yelverton, devon, via, intermediaries, from, sir, richard, grenville, he, lived, there, for, fifteen, years, until, his, final, voyage, and, it, remained, in, his, family, until, 1946, buckland, abbey, is, now, in, the, care, of, the, national, trust, and, a, number, of, mementos, of, his, life, are, displayed, there, his, coat, of, arms, and, full, achievement, is, depicted, in, the, form, of, a, large, coloured, plaster, overmantel, in, the, lifetimes, gallery, at, buckland, abbey, drake, was, one, of, twelve, children, his, brother, thomas, accompanied, him, on, voyages, and, named, his, son, after, him, that, nephew, eventually, became, sir, francis, drake, 1st, baronet, historical, sources, on, drake, s, early, life, are, scarce, and, tend, to, be, obscure, two, common, scholarly, traditions, concerning, his, life, and, contributions, have, resulted, the, older, tradition, can, be, found, in, julian, corbett, s, biography, drake, and, the, tudor, navy, 1898, which, identifies, drake, as, the, single, most, important, figure, in, the, founding, and, triumph, of, the, british, navy, the, alternative, approach, locates, drake, squarely, within, privateering, the, first, has, tended, to, laud, only, his, successes, while, sugden, writes, that, the, second, approach, which, emphasises, his, flaws, and, failures, has, sometimes, been, less, than, just, drake, left, behind, no, words, of, his, own, only, his, actions, and, their, interpretation, which, as, peter, whitfield, says, is, open, to, deep, disagreement, according, to, whitfield, scholarship, on, drake, has, moved, from, the, hero, worship, of, the, victorians, to, the, cold, iconoclasm, of, the, twenty, first, century, drake, s, will, was, the, focus, of, an, extensive, confidence, scam, which, oscar, hartzell, perpetrated, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, drake, s, drum, has, become, an, icon, of, english, folklore, with, its, variation, of, the, classic, king, asleep, in, mountain, story, motif, drake, was, a, major, focus, in, the, video, game, series, uncharted, specifically, its, first, and, third, instalments, uncharted, drake, s, fortune, and, uncharted, 3, drake, s, deception, respectively, the, series, follows,

played, drake, in, the, 26, episode, adventure, drama, in, valpara, so, chile, folklore, associates, a, cave, known, as, cueva, del, pirata, lit, cave, of, the, pirate, with, francis, drake, a, legend, says, that, when, drake, ransacked, the, port, he, was, disappointed, with, the, scant, plunder, and, proceeded, to, enter, the, churches, in, fury, to, sack, them, and, urinate, on, the,
