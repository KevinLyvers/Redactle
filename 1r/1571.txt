calcutta, on, the, night, of, 17, january, 1941, accompanied, by, his, nephew, sisir, kumar, bose, later, reaching, gomoh, railway, station, now, netaji, subhas, chandra, bose, gomoh, station, in, the, then, state, of, bihar, now, jharkhand, india, bose, journeyed, to, peshawar, with, the, help, of, the, abwehr, where, he, was, met, by, akbar, shah, mohammed, shah, and, bhagat, ram, talwar, bose, was, taken, to, the, home, of, abad, khan, a, trusted, friend, of, akbar, shah, s, on, 26, january, 1941, bose, began, his, journey, to, reach, russia, through, british, india, s, north, west, frontier, with, afghanistan, for, this, reason, he, enlisted, the, help, of, mian, akbar, shah, then, a, forward, bloc, leader, in, the, north, west, frontier, province, shah, had, been, out, of, india, en, route, to, the, soviet, union, and, suggested, a, novel, disguise, for, bose, to, assume, since, bose, could, not, speak, pashto, it, would, have, made, him, an, easy, target, of, pashto, speakers, working, for, the, british, for, this, reason, shah, suggested, that, bose, act, deaf, and, dumb, and, let, his, beard, grow, to, mimic, those, of, the, tribesmen, bose, s, guide, bhagat, ram, talwar, unknown, to, him, was, a, soviet, agent, supporters, of, the, aga, khan, iii, helped, him, across, the, border, into, afghanistan, where, he, was, met, by, an, abwehr, unit, posing, as, a, party, of, road, construction, engineers, from, the, organization, todt, who, then, aided, his, passage, across, afghanistan, via, kabul, to, the, border, with, the, soviet, union, after, assuming, the, guise, of, a, pashtun, insurance, agent, ziaudddin, to, reach, afghanistan, bose, changed, his, guise, and, travelled, to, moscow, on, the, italian, passport, of, an, italian, nobleman, count, orlando, mazzotta, from, moscow, he, reached, rome, and, from, there, he, travelled, to, nazi, germany, once, in, russia, the, nkvd, transported, bose, to, moscow, where, he, hoped, that, russia, s, historical, enmity, to, british, rule, in, india, would, result, in, support, for, his, plans, for, a, popular, rising, in, india, however, bose, found, the, soviets, response, disappointing, and, was, rapidly, passed, over, to, the, german, ambassador, in, moscow, count, von, der, schulenburg, he, had, bose, flown, on, to, berlin, in, a, special, courier, aircraft, at, the, beginning, of, april, where, he, was, to, receive, a, more, favourable, hearing, from, joachim, von, ribbentrop, and, the, foreign, ministry, officials, at, the, wilhelmstrasse, in, germany, bose, was, attached, to, the, special, bureau, for, india, under, adam, von, trott, zu, solz, which, was, responsible, for, broadcasting, on, the, german, sponsored, azad, hind, radio, he, founded, the, free, india, center, in, berlin, and, created, the, indian, legion, consisting, of, some, 4500, soldiers, out, of, indian, prisoners, of, war, who, had, previously, fought, for, the, british, in, north, africa, prior, to, their, capture, by, axis, forces, the, indian, legion, was, attached, to, the, wehrmacht, and, later, transferred, to, the, waffen, ss, its, members, swore, the, following, allegiance, to, hitler, and, bose, i, swear, by, god, this, holy, oath, that, i, will, obey, the, leader, of, the, german, race, and, state, adolf, hitler, as, the, commander, of, the, german, armed, forces, in, the, fight, for, india, whose, leader, is, subhas, chandra, bose, this, oath, clearly, abrogated, control, of, the, indian, legion, to, the, german, armed, forces, whilst, stating, bose, s, overall, leadership, of, india, he, was, also, however, prepared, to, envisage, an, invasion, of, india, via, the, ussr, by, nazi, troops, spearheaded, by, the, azad, hind, legion, many, have, questioned, his, judgment, here, as, it, seems, unlikely, that, the, germans, could, have, been, easily, persuaded, to, leave, after, such, an, invasion, which, might, also, have, resulted, in, an, axis, victory, in, the, war, soon, according, to, historian, romain, hayes, the, german, foreign, office, procured, a, luxurious, residence, for, bose, along, with, a, butler, cook, gardener, and, an, ss, chauffeured, car, emilie, schenkl, moved, in, openly, with, him, the, germans, aware, of, the, nature, of, the, relationship, refrained, from, any, involvement, however, most, of, the, staff, in, the, special, bureau, for, india, which, had, been, set, up, to, aid, bose, did, not, get, along, with, emilie, in, particular, adam, von, trott, alexander, werth, and, freda, kretschemer, according, to, historian, leonard, a, gordon, appear, to, have, disliked, her, intensely, they, believed, that, she, and, bose, were, not, married, and, that, she, was, using, her, liaison, with, bose, to, live, an, especially, comfortable, life, during, the, hard, times, of, war, and, that, differences, were, compounded, by, issues, of, class, in, november, 1942, schenkl, gave, birth, to, their, daughter, the, germans, were, unwilling, to, form, an, alliance, with, bose, because, they, considered, him, unpopular, in, comparison, with, mahatma, gandhi, and, jawaharlal, nehru, by, the, spring, of, 1942, the, german, army, was, mired, in, the, ussr, bose, due, to, disappointment, over, the, lack, of, response, from, nazi, germany, was, now, keen, to, move, to, southeast, asia, where, japan, had, just, won, quick, victories, however, he, still, expected, official, recognition, from, nazi, germany, adolf, hitler, during, his, only, meeting, with, bose, in, late, may, 1942, refused, to, entertain, bose, s, requests, and, facilitated, him, with, a, submarine, voyage, to, east, asia, in, february, 1943, bose, left, schenkl, and, their, baby, daughter, and, boarded, a, german, submarine, to, travel, via, transfer, to, a, japanese, submarine, to, japanese, occupied, southeast, asia, in, all, 3, 000, indian, prisoners, of, war, signed, up, for, the, free, india, legion, but, instead, of, being, delighted, bose, was, worried, a, left, wing, admirer, of, russia, he, was, devastated, when, hitler, s, tanks, rolled, across, the, soviet, border, matters, were, worsened, by, the, fact, that, the, now, retreating, german, army, would, be, in, no, position, to, offer, him, help, in, driving, the, british, from, india, when, he, met, hitler, in, may, 1942, his, suspicions, were, confirmed, and, he, came, to, believe, that, the, nazi, leader, was, more, interested, in, using, his, men, to, win, propaganda, victories, than, military, ones, so, in, february, 1943, bose, boarded, a, german, u, boat, and, left, for, japan, this, left, the, men, he, had, recruited, leaderless, and, demoralised, in, germany, in, 1943, after, being, disillusioned, that, germany, could, be, of, any, help, in, gaining, india, s, independence, bose, left, for, japan, he, travelled, with, the, german, submarine, u, 180, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, to, the, southeast, of, madagascar, where, he, was, transferred, to, the, i, 29, for, the, rest, of, the, journey, to, imperial, japan, this, was, the, only, civilian, transfer, between, two, submarines, of, two, different, navies, in, world, war, ii, the, indian, national, army, ina, was, the, brainchild, of, japanese, major, and, post, war, lieutenant, general, iwaichi, fujiwara, head, of, the, japanese, intelligence, unit, fujiwara, kikan, fujiwara, s, mission, was, to, raise, an, army, which, would, fight, alongside, the, japanese, army, he, first, met, pritam, singh, dhillon, the, president, of, the, bangkok, chapter, of, the, indian, independence, league, and, through, pritam, singh, s, network, recruited, a, captured, british, indian, army, captain, mohan, singh, on, the, western, malayan, peninsula, in, december, 1941, the, first, indian, national, army, was, formed, as, a, result, of, discussion, between, fujiwara, and, mohan, singh, in, the, second, half, of, december, 1941, and, the, name, chosen, jointly, by, them, in, the, first, week, of, january, 1942, this, was, along, the, concept, of, and, with, support, of, what, was, then, known, as, the, indian, independence, league, headed, from, tokyo, by, expatriate, nationalist, leader, rash, behari, bose, the, first, ina, was, however, disbanded, in, december, 1942, after, disagreements, between, the, hikari, kikan, and, mohan, singh, who, came, to, believe, that, the, japanese, high, command, was, using, the, ina, as, a, mere, pawn, and, propaganda, tool, singh, was, taken, into, custody, and, the, troops, returned, to, the, prisoner, of, war, camp, however, the, idea, of, an, independence, army, was, revived, with, the, arrival, of, subhas, chandra, bose, in, the, far, east, in, 1943, in, july, at, a, meeting, in, singapore, rash, behari, bose, handed, over, control, of, the, organisation, to, subhas, chandra, bose, bose, was, able, to, reorganise, the, fledgling, army, and, organise, massive, support, among, the, expatriate, indian, population, in, south, east, asia, who, lent, their, support, by, both, enlisting, in, the, indian, national, army, as, well, as, financially, in, response, to, bose, s, calls, for, sacrifice, for, the, independence, cause, ina, had, a, separate, women, s, unit, the, rani, of, jhansi, regiment, named, after, rani, lakshmi, bai, headed, by, capt, lakshmi, swaminathan, which, is, seen, as, a, first, of, its, kind, in, asia, even, when, faced, with, military, reverses, bose, was, able, to, maintain, support, for, the, azad, hind, movement, spoken, as, a, part, of, a, motivational, speech, for, the, indian, national, army, at, a, rally, of, indians, in, burma, on, 4, july, 1944, bose, s, most, famous, quote, was, give, me, blood, and, i, shall, give, you, freedom, in, this, he, urged, the, people, of, india, to, join, him, in, his, fight, against, the, british, raj, spoken, in, hindi, bose, s, words, are, highly, evocative, the, troops, of, the, ina, were, under, the, aegis, of, a, provisional, government, the, azad, hind, government, which, came, to, produce, its, own, currency, postage, stamps, court, and, civil, code, and, was, recognised, by, nine, axis, states, germany, japan, italian, social, republic, the, independent, state, of, croatia, the, wang, jingwei, regime, in, nanjing, china, a, provisional, government, of, burma, manchukuo, and, japanese, controlled, philippines, of, those, countries, five, were, authorities, established, under, axis, occupation, this, government, participated, in, the, so, called, greater, east, asia, conference, as, an, observer, in, november, 1943, the, ina, s, first, commitment, was, in, the, japanese, thrust, towards, eastern, indian, frontiers, of, manipur, ina, s, special, forces, the, bahadur, group, were, involved, in, operations, behind, enemy, lines, both, during, the, diversionary, attacks, in, arakan, as, well, as, the, japanese, thrust, towards, imphal, and, kohima, the, japanese, also, took, possession, of, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, in, 1942, and, a, year, later, the, provisional, government, and, the, ina, were, established, in, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, with, lt, col, arcot, doraiswamy, loganadan, appointed, its, governor, general, the, islands, were, renamed, shaheed, martyr, and, swaraj, independence, however, the, japanese, navy, remained, in, essential, control, of, the, island, s, administration, during, bose, s, only, visit, to, the, islands, in, early, 1944, apparently, in, the, interest, of, shielding, bose, from, attaining, a, full, knowledge, of, ultimate, japanese, intentions, his, japanese, hosts, carefully, isolated, him, from, the, local, population, at, that, time, the, island, s, japanese, administration, had, been, torturing, the, leader, of, the, island, s, indian, independence, league, diwan, singh, who, later, died, of, his, injuries, in, the, cellular, jail, during, bose, s, visit, to, the, islands, several, locals, attempted, to, alert, bose, to, singh, s, plight, but, apparently, without, success, during, this, time, loganathan, became, aware, of, his, lack, of, any, genuine, administrative, control, and, resigned, in, protest, as, governor, general, later, returning, to, the, government, s, headquarters, in, rangoon, on, the, indian, mainland, an, indian, tricolour, flag, modelled, after, that, of, the, indian, national, congress, was, raised, for, the, first, time, in, the, town, of, moirang, in, manipur, in, north, eastern, india, the, adjacent, towns, of, kohima, and, imphal, were, then, encircled, and, placed, under, siege, by, divisions, of, the, japanese, army, working, in, conjunction, with, the, burmese, national, army, and, with, brigades, of, the, ina, known, as, the, gandhi, and, nehru, brigades, this, attempt, at, conquering, the, indian, mainland, had, the, axis, codename, of, operation, u, go, during, this, operation, on, 6, july, 1944, in, a, speech, broadcast, by, the, azad, hind, radio, from, singapore, bose, addressed, mahatma, gandhi, as, the, father, of, the, nation, and, asked, for, his, blessings, and, good, wishes, for, the, war, he, was, fighting, this, was, the, first, time, that, gandhi, was, referred, to, by, this, appellation, the, protracted, japanese, attempts, to, take, these, two, towns, depleted, japanese, resources, with, operation, u, go, ultimately, proving, unsuccessful, through, several, months, of, japanese, onslaught, on, these, two, towns, commonwealth, forces, remained, entrenched, in, the, towns, commonwealth, forces, then, counter, attacked, inflicting, serious, losses, on, the, axis, led, forces, who, were, then, forced, into, a, retreat, back, into, burmese, territory, after, the, japanese, defeat, at, the, battles, of, kohima, and, imphal, bose, s, provisional, government, s, aim, of, establishing, a, base, in, mainland, india, was, lost, forever, still, the, ina, fought, in, key, battles, against, the, british, indian, army, in, burmese, territory, notable, in, meiktilla, mandalay, pegu, nyangyu, and, mount, popa, however, with, the, fall, of, rangoon, bose, s, government, ceased, to, be, an, effective, political, entity, a, large, proportion, of, the, ina, troops, surrendered, under, lt, col, loganathan, the, remaining, troops, retreated, with, bose, towards, malaya, or, made, for, thailand, japan, s, surrender, at, the, end, of, the, war, also, led, to, the, surrender, of, the, remaining, elements, of, the, indian, national, army, the, ina, prisoners, were, then, repatriated, to, india, and, some, tried, for, treason, subhas, chandra, bose, died, on, 18, august, 1945, from, third, degree, burns, after, his, airplane, crashed, in, japanese, ruled, formosa, now, taiwan, however, many, among, his, supporters, especially, in, bengal, refused, at, the, time, and, have, refused, since, to, believe, either, the, fact, or, the, circumstances, of, his, death, conspiracy, theories, appeared, within, hours, of, his, death, and, have, thereafter, had, a, long, shelf, life, keeping, alive, various, martial, myths, about, bose, in, taihoku, at, around, 2, 30, pm, as, the, bomber, with, bose, on, board, was, leaving, the, standard, path, taken, by, aircraft, during, take, off, the, passengers, inside, heard, a, loud, sound, similar, to, an, engine, backfiring, the, mechanics, on, the, tarmac, saw, something, fall, out, of, the, plane, it, was, the, portside, engine, or, a, part, of, it, and, the, propeller, the, plane, swung, wildly, to, the, right, and, plummeted, crashing, breaking, into, two, and, exploding, into, flames, inside, the, chief, pilot, copilot, and, lieutenant, general, tsunamasa, shidei, the, vice, chief, of, staff, of, the, japanese, kwantung, army, who, was, to, have, made, the, negotiations, for, bose, with, the, soviet, army, in, manchuria, were, instantly, killed, bose, s, assistant, habibur, rahman, was, stunned, passing, out, briefly, and, bose, although, conscious, and, not, fatally, hurt, was, soaked, in, gasoline, when, rahman, came, to, he, and, bose, attempted, to, leave, by, the, rear, door, but, found, it, blocked, by, the, luggage, they, then, decided, to, run, through, the, flames, and, exit, from, the, front, the, ground, staff, now, approaching, the, plane, saw, two, people, staggering, towards, them, one, of, whom, had, become, a, human, torch, the, human, torch, turned, out, to, be, bose, whose, gasoline, soaked, clothes, had, instantly, ignited, rahman, and, a, few, others, managed, to, smother, the, flames, but, also, noticed, that, bose, s, face, and, head, appeared, badly, burned, according, to, joyce, chapman, lebra, a, truck, which, served, as, ambulance, rushed, bose, and, the, other, passengers, to, the, nanmon, military, hospital, south, of, taihoku, the, airport, personnel, called, dr, taneyoshi, yoshimi, the, surgeon, in, charge, at, the, hospital, at, around, 3, pm, bose, was, conscious, and, mostly, coherent, when, they, reached, the, hospital, and, for, some, time, thereafter, bose, was, naked, except, for, a, blanket, wrapped, around, him, and, dr, yoshimi, immediately, saw, evidence, of, third, degree, burns, on, many, parts, of, the, body, especially, on, his, chest, doubting, very, much, that, he, would, live, dr, yoshimi, promptly, began, to, treat, bose, and, was, assisted, by, dr, tsuruta, according, to, historian, leonard, a, gordon, who, interviewed, all, the, hospital, personnel, later, a, disinfectant, rivamol, was, put, over, most, of, his, body, and, then, a, white, ointment, was, applied, and, he, was, bandaged, over, most, of, his, body, dr, yoshimi, gave, bose, four, injections, of, vita, camphor, and, two, of, digitamine, for, his, weakened, heart, these, were, given, about, every, 30, minutes, since, his, body, had, lost, fluids, quickly, upon, being, burnt, he, was, also, given, ringer, solution, intravenously, a, third, doctor, dr, ishii, gave, him, a, blood, transfusion, an, orderly, kazuo, mitsui, an, army, private, was, in, the, room, and, several, nurses, were, also, assisting, bose, still, had, a, clear, head, which, dr, yoshimi, found, remarkable, for, someone, with, such, severe, injuries, soon, in, spite, of, the, treatment, bose, went, into, a, coma, a, few, hours, later, between, 9, and, 10, pm, local, time, on, saturday, 18, august, 1945, bose, died, aged, 48, bose, s, body, was, cremated, in, the, main, taihoku, crematorium, two, days, later, 20, august, 1945, on, 23, august, 1945, the, japanese, news, agency, do, trzei, announced, the, death, of, bose, and, shidea, on, 7, september, a, japanese, officer, lieutenant, tatsuo, hayashida, carried, bose, s, ashes, to, tokyo, and, the, following, morning, they, were, handed, to, the, president, of, the, tokyo, indian, independence, league, rama, murti, on, 14, september, a, memorial, service, was, held, for, bose, in, tokyo, and, a, few, days, later, the, ashes, were, turned, over, to, the, priest, of, the, renk, ji, temple, of, nichiren, buddhism, in, tokyo, there, they, have, remained, ever, since, among, the, ina, personnel, there, was, widespread, disbelief, shock, and, trauma, most, affected, were, the, young, tamil, indians, from, malaya, and, singapore, both, men, and, women, who, comprised, the, bulk, of, the, civilians, who, had, enlisted, in, the, ina, the, professional, soldiers, in, the, ina, most, of, whom, were, punjabis, faced, an, uncertain, future, with, many, fatalistically, expecting, reprisals, from, the, british, in, india, the, indian, national, congress, s, official, line, was, succinctly, expressed, in, a, letter, mohandas, karamchand, mahatma, gandhi, wrote, to, rajkumari, amrit, kaur, said, gandhi, subhas, bose, has, died, well, he, was, undoubtedly, a, patriot, though, misguided, many, congressmen, had, not, forgiven, bose, for, quarrelling, with, gandhi, and, for, collaborating, with, what, they, considered, was, japanese, fascism, the, indian, soldiers, in, the, british, indian, army, some, two, and, a, half, million, of, whom, had, fought, during, the, second, world, war, were, conflicted, about, the, ina, some, saw, the, ina, as, traitors, and, wanted, them, punished, others, felt, more, sympathetic, the, british, raj, though, never, seriously, threatened, by, the, ina, tried, 300, ina, officers, for, treason, in, the, ina, trials, but, eventually, backtracked, subhas, chandra, bose, believed, that, the, bhagavad, gita, was, a, great, source, of, inspiration, for, the, struggle, against, the, british, swami, vivekananda, s, teachings, on, universalism, his, nationalist, thoughts, and, his, emphasis, on, social, service, and, reform, had, all, inspired, subhas, chandra, bose, from, his, very, young, days, the, fresh, interpretation, of, india, s, ancient, scriptures, had, appealed, immensely, to, him, some, scholars, think, that, hindu, spirituality, formed, an, essential, part, of, his, political, and, social, thought, as, historian, leonard, gordon, explains, inner, religious, explorations, continued, to, be, a, part, of, his, adult, life, this, set, him, apart, from, the, slowly, growing, number, of, atheistic, socialists, and, communists, who, dotted, the, indian, landscape, bose, first, expressed, his, preference, for, a, synthesis, of, what, modern, europe, calls, socialism, and, fascism, in, a, 1930, speech, in, calcutta, bose, later, criticized, nehru, s, 1933, statement, that, there, is, no, middle, road, between, communism, and, fascism, describing, it, as, fundamentally, wrong, bose, believed, communism, would, not, gain, ground, in, india, due, to, its, rejection, of, nationalism, and, religion, and, suggested, a, synthesis, between, communism, and, fascism, could, take, hold, instead, in, 1944, bose, similarly, stated, our, philosophy, should, be, a, synthesis, between, national, socialism, and, communism, bose, believed, that, authoritarianism, could, bring, liberation, and, reconstruction, of, indian, society, he, expressed, admiration, for, the, authoritarian, methods, which, he, saw, in, italy, and, germany, during, the, 1930s, he, thought, they, could, be, used, to, build, an, independent, india, to, a, large, number, of, congress, leaders, bose, programme, shared, enough, similarities, with, japanese, fascists, after, getting, marginalized, within, congress, bose, chose, to, embrace, fascist, regimes, as, allies, against, the, british, and, fled, india, bose, believed, that, india, must, have, a, political, system, state, of, an, authoritarian, character, and, a, strong, central, government, with, dictatorial, powers, for, some, years, to, come, earlier, bose, had, clearly, expressed, his, belief, that, democracy, was, the, best, option, for, india, however, during, the, war, and, possibly, as, early, as, the, 1930s, bose, seems, to, have, decided, that, no, democratic, system, could, be, adequate, to, overcome, india, s, poverty, and, social, inequalities, and, he, wrote, that, a, socialist, state, similar, to, that, of, soviet, russia, which, he, had, also, seen, and, admired, would, be, needed, for, the, process, of, national, re, building, accordingly, some, suggest, that, bose, s, alliance, with, the, axis, during, the, war, was, based, on, more, than, just, pragmatism, and, that, bose, was, a, militant, nationalist, though, not, a, nazi, nor, a, fascist, for, he, supported, the, empowerment, of, women, secularism, and, other, liberal, ideas, alternatively, others, consider, he, might, have, been, using, populist, methods, of, mobilisation, common, to, many, post, colonial, leaders, since, before, the, beginning, of, the, world, war, ii, bose, was, opposed, to, the, attempts, to, grant, jewish, refugees, asylum, in, india, the, great, anti, jewish, pogrom, called, the, night, of, broken, glass, happened, on, 9, november, 1938, in, early, december, the, pro, hindu, mahasabha, journals, published, articles, lending, support, to, german, anti, semitism, this, stance, brought, hindu, mahasabha, into, conflict, with, the, congress, which, on, 12, december, issued, a, statement, containing, references, to, recent, european, events, within, the, congress, only, bose, opposed, this, stance, of, the, party, after, some, months, in, april, 1939, bose, refused, to, support, the, party, motion, that, jews, can, find, refuge, in, india, in, 1938, bose, had, denounced, nazi, racial, policy, and, persecution, of, jews, however, in, 1942, he, had, published, an, article, in, the, journal, angriff, where, he, wrote, that, indians, were, true, aryans, and, the, brethren, of, the, germans, bose, added, that, swastika, symbol, of,
