most, formidable, army, in, europe, which, frederick, used, to, increase, prussia, s, power, although, a, highly, effective, ruler, frederick, william, had, a, perpetually, short, temper, which, sometimes, drove, him, to, physically, attack, servants, or, even, his, own, children, with, a, cane, at, the, slightest, perceived, provocation, his, violent, harsh, nature, was, further, exacerbated, by, his, inherited, porphyritic, disease, which, gave, him, gout, obesity, and, frequent, crippling, stomach, pains, he, also, had, a, notable, contempt, for, france, and, would, sometimes, fly, into, a, rage, at, the, mere, mention, of, that, country, although, this, did, not, stop, him, from, encouraging, the, immigration, of, french, huguenot, refugees, to, prussia,

to, hohenzollern, castle, where, it, remained, until, 1991, when, it, was, finally, laid, to, rest, on, the, steps, of, the, altar, in, the, kaiser, friedrich, mausoleum, in, the, church, of, peace, on, the, palace, grounds, of, sanssouci, the, original, black, marble, sarcophagus, collapsed, at, burg, hohenzollern, the, current, one, is, a, copper, copy, his, eldest, surviving, son, was, frederick, ii, fritz, born, in, 1712, frederick, william, wanted, him, to, become, a, fine, soldier, as, a, small, child, fritz, was, awakened, each, morning, by, the, firing, of, a, cannon, at, the, age, of, 6, he, was, given, his, own, regiment, of, children, to, drill, as, cadets, and, a, year, later, he, was, given, a, miniature, arsenal, the, love, and, affection, frederick, william, had, for, his, heir, initially, was, soon, soured, due, to, their, increasingly, different, personalities, frederick, william, ordered, fritz, to, undergo, a, minimal, education, live, a, simple, protestant, lifestyle, and, focus, on, the, army, and, statesmanship, as, he, had, however, the, intellectual, fritz, was, more, interested, in, music, books, and, french, culture, which, were, forbidden, by, his, father, as, decadent, and, unmanly, as, fritz, s, defiance, for, his, father, s, rules, increased, frederick, william, would, frequently, beat, or, humiliate, fritz, he, preferred, his, younger, sibling, augustus, william, fritz, was, beaten, for, being, thrown, off, a, bolting, horse, and, wearing, gloves, in, cold, weather, at, age, 16, frederick, seems, to, have, embarked, upon, a, youthful, affair, with, peter, karl, christoph, von, keith, a, 17, year, old, page, of, his, father, rumors, of, the, liaison, spread, in, the, court, and, the, intimacy, between, the, two, boys, provoked, the, comments, of, his, sister, wilhelmine, who, wrote, though, i, had, noticed, that, he, was, on, more, familiar, terms, with, this, page, than, was, proper, in, his, position, i, did, not, know, how, intimate, the, friendship, was, rumors, finally, reached, king, frederick, william, who, cultivated, an, ideal, of, ultramasculinity, in, his, court, and, derided, his, son, s, supposedly, effeminate, tendencies, as, a, result, keith, was, dismissed, from, his, service, to, the, king, and, sent, away, to, a, regiment, by, the, dutch, border, while, frederick, was, sent, to, the, king, s, hunting, lodge, at, k, nigs, wusterhausen, in, order, to, repent, of, his, sin, after, the, prince, attempted, to, flee, to, england, with, his, tutor, hans, hermann, von, katte, the, enraged, king, had, katte, beheaded, before, the, eyes, of, the, prince, who, himself, was, court, martialled, the, king, may, have, thought, that, frederick, s, relationship, with, katte, was, also, romantic, a, suspicion, that, may, have, played, a, role, in, katte, receiving, a, death, sentence, in, any, case, the, court, declared, itself, not, competent, in, the, case, of, the, crown, prince, whether, it, was, the, king, s, intention, to, have, his, son, executed, as, well, as, voltaire, claims, is, not, clear, however, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vi, intervened, claiming, that, a, prince, could, only, be, tried, by, the, imperial, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, itself, frederick, was, imprisoned, in, the, fortress, of, k, strin, from, 2, september, to, 19, november, 1731, and, exiled, from, court, until, february, 1732, during, which, time, he, was, rigorously, schooled, in, matters, of, state, after, achieving, a, measure, of, reconciliation, frederick, william, had, his, son, married, to, princess, elisabeth, christine, of, brunswick, wolfenb, ttel, bevern, whom, frederick, despised, but, then, grudgingly, allowed, him, to, indulge, in, his, musical, and, literary, interests, again, he, also, gifted, him, a, stud, farm, in, east, prussia, and, rheinsberg, palace, by, the, time, of, frederick, william, s, death, in, 1740, he, and, frederick, were, on, at, least, reasonable, terms, with, each, other, although, the, relationship, between, frederick, william, and, frederick, was, clearly, hostile, frederick, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, his, father, penetrated, and, understood, great, objectives, and, knew, the, best, interests, of, his, country, better, than, any, minister, or, general, frederick, william, married, his, first, cousin, sophia, dorothea, of, hanover, george, ii, s, younger, sister, daughter, of, his, uncle, king, george, i, of, great, britain, and, sophia, dorothea, of, celle, on, 28, november, 1706, frederick, william, was, faithful, and, loving, to, his, wife, but, they, did, not, have, a, happy, relationship, sophia, dorothea, feared, his, unpredictable, temper, and, resented, him, both, for, allowing, her, no, influence, or, independence, at, court, and, for, refusing, to, marry, her, children, to, their, english, cousins, she, also, abhorred, his, cruelty, towards, their, son, and, heir, frederick, with, whom, she, was, close, although, rather, than, trying, to, mend, the, relationship, between, father, and, son, she, frequently, spurred, frederick, on, in, his, defiance, they, had, fourteen, children, including, he, was, the, godfather, of, the, prussian, envoy, friedrich, wilhelm, von, thulemeyer, and, of, his, grand, nephew, prince, edward, augustus, of, great, britain, k, nigs, wusterhausen, castle, the, king, s, hunting, lodge, and, garden, were, his, favourite, place, to, stay, and, to, indulge, in, hunting, when, he, wanted, to, relax, from, his, state, duties, which, he, performed, at, the, berlin, palace, and, the, city, palace, potsdam, his, children, also, had, to, spend, their, holidays, here, regularly, frederick, the, great, had, a, strong, dislike, for, the, place, but, the, two, youngest, sons, in, old, age, after, frederick, s, death, returned, together, a, few, times, out, of, sentimental, memories, to, where, they, spent, so, much, time, growing, up, today, the, castle, southeast, of, the, berlin, city, limits, not, far, from, berlin, airport, is, a, museum, of, the, prussian, palaces, and, gardens, foundation, berlin, brandenburg, numerous,
