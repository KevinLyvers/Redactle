wilhelm, conrad, r, ntgen, r, n, t, n, d, n, r, n, t, german, 27, march, 1845, 10, february, 1923, was, a, german, mechanical, engineer, and, physicist, who, on, 8, november, 1895, produced, and, detected, electromagnetic, radiation, in, a, wavelength, range, known, as, x, rays, or, r, ntgen, rays, an, achievement, that, earned, him, the, inaugural, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1901, in, honour, of, r, ntgen, s, accomplishments, in, 2004, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, named, element, 111, roentgenium, a, radioactive, element, with, multiple, unstable, isotopes, after, him, the, unit, of, measurement, roentgen, was, also, named, after, him, he, was, born, to, friedrich, conrad, r, ntgen, a, german, merchant, and, cloth, manufacturer, and, charlotte, constanze, frowein, when, he, was, aged, three, his, family, moved, to, the, netherlands, where, his, mother, s, family, lived, r, ntgen, attended, high, school, at, utrecht, technical, school, in, utrecht, netherlands, he, followed, courses, at, the, technical, school, for, almost, two, years, in, 1865, he, was, unfairly, expelled, from, high, school, when, one, of, his, teachers, intercepted, a, caricature, of, one, of, the, teachers, which, was, drawn, by, someone, else, without, a, high, school, diploma, r, ntgen, could, only, attend, university, in, the, netherlands, as, a, visitor, in, 1865, he, tried, to, attend, utrecht, university, without, having, the, necessary, credentials, required, for, a, regular, student, upon, hearing, that, he, could, enter, the, federal, polytechnic, institute, in, z, rich, today, known, as, the, eth, zurich, he, passed, the, entrance, examination, and, began, his, studies, there, as, a, student, of, mechanical, engineering, in, 1869, he, graduated, with, a, phd, from, the, university, of, zurich, once, there, he, became, a, favourite, student, of, professor, august, kundt, whom, he, followed, to, the, newly, founded, german, kaiser, wilhelms, universit, t, in, strasbourg, in, 1874, r, ntgen, became, a, lecturer, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, in, 1875, he, became, a, professor, at, the, academy, of, agriculture, at, hohenheim, w, rttemberg, he, returned, to, strasbourg, as, a, professor, of, physics, in, 1876, and, in, 1879, he, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, physics, at, the, university, of, giessen, in, 1888, he, obtained, the, physics, chair, at, the, university, of, w, rzburg, and, in, 1900, at, the, university, of, munich, by, special, request, of, the, bavarian, government, r, ntgen, had, family, in, iowa, in, the, united, states, and, planned, to, emigrate, he, accepted, an, appointment, at, columbia, university, in, new, york, city, and, bought, transatlantic, tickets, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, changed, his, plans, he, remained, in, munich, for, the, rest, of, his, career, during, 1895, at, his, laboratory, in, the, w, rzburg, physical, institute, of, the, university, of, w, rzburg, r, ntgen, was, investigating, the, external, effects, of, passing, an, electrical, discharge, through, various, types, of, vacuum, tube, equipment, apparatuses, from, heinrich, hertz, johann, hittorf, william, crookes, nikola, tesla, and, philipp, von, lenard, in, early, november, he, was, repeating, an, experiment, with, one, of, lenard, s, tubes, in, which, a, thin, aluminium, window, had, been, added, to, permit, the, cathode, rays, to, exit, the, tube, but, a, cardboard, covering, was, added, to, protect, the, aluminium, from, damage, by, the, strong, electrostatic, field, that, produces, the, cathode, rays, r, ntgen, knew, that, the, cardboard, covering, prevented, light, from, escaping, yet, he, observed, that, the, invisible, cathode, rays, caused, a, fluorescent, effect, on, a, small, cardboard, screen, painted, with, barium, platinocyanide, when, it, was, placed, close, to, the, aluminium, window, it, occurred, to, r, ntgen, that, the, crookes, hittorf, tube, which, had, a, much, thicker, glass, wall, than, the, lenard, tube, might, also, cause, this, fluorescent, effect, in, the, late, afternoon, of, 8, november, 1895, r, ntgen, was, determined, to, test, his, idea, he, carefully, constructed, a, black, cardboard, covering, similar, to, the, one, he, had, used, on, the, lenard, tube, he, covered, the, crookes, hittorf, tube, with, the, cardboard, and, attached, electrodes, to, a, ruhmkorff, coil, to, generate, an, electrostatic, charge, before, setting, up, the, barium, platinocyanide, screen, to, test, his, idea, r, ntgen, darkened, the, room, to, test, the, opacity, of, his, cardboard, cover, as, he, passed, the, ruhmkorff, coil, charge, through, the, tube, he, determined, that, the, cover, was, light, tight, and, turned, to, prepare, for, the, next, step, of, the, experiment, it, was, at, this, point, that, r, ntgen, noticed, a, faint, shimmering, from, a, bench, a, few, feet, away, from, the, tube, to, be, sure, he, tried, several, more, discharges, and, saw, the, same, shimmering, each, time, striking, a, match, he, discovered, the, shimmering, had, come, from, the, location, of, the, barium, platinocyanide, screen, he, had, been, intending, to, use, next, based, on, the, formation, of, regular, shadows, r, ntgen, termed, the, phenomenon, rays, 40, as, 8, november, was, a, friday, so, he, took, advantage, of, the, weekend, to, repeat, his, experiments, and, made, his, first, notes, in, the, following, weeks, he, ate, and, slept, in, his, laboratory, as, he, investigated, many, properties, of, the, new, rays, he, temporarily, termed, x, rays, using, the, mathematical, designation, x, for, something, unknown, the, new, rays, came, to, bear, his, name, in, many, languages, as, r, ntgen, rays, and, the, associated, x, ray, radiograms, as, r, ntgenograms, at, one, point, while, he, was, investigating, the, ability, of, various, materials, to, stop, the, rays, r, ntgen, brought, a, small, piece, of, lead, into, position, while, a, discharge, was, occurring, r, ntgen, thus, saw, the, first, radiographic, image, his, own, flickering, ghostly, skeleton, on, the, barium, platinocyanide, screen, about, six, weeks, after, his, discovery, he, took, a, picture, a, radiograph, using, x, rays, of, his, wife, anna, bertha, s, hand, when, she, saw, her, skeleton, she, exclaimed, i, have, seen, my, death, he, later, took, a, better, picture, of, his, friend, albert, von, k, lliker, s, hand, at, a, public, lecture, r, ntgen, s, original, paper, on, a, new, kind, of, rays, ueber, eine, neue, art, von, strahlen, was, published, on, 28, december, 1895, on, 5, january, 1896, an, austrian, newspaper, reported, r, ntgen, s, discovery, of, a, new, type, of, radiation, r, ntgen, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctor, of, medicine, degree, from, the, university, of, w, rzburg, after, his, discovery, he, also, received, the, rumford, medal, of, the, british, royal, society, in, 1896, jointly, with, philipp, lenard, who, had, already, shown, that, a, portion, of, the, cathode, rays, could, pass, through, a, thin, film, of, a, metal, such, as, aluminium, r, ntgen, published, a, total, of, three, papers, on, x, rays, between, 1895, and, 1897, today, r, ntgen, is, considered, the, father, of, diagnostic, radiology, the, medical, speciality, which, uses, imaging, to, diagnose, disease, r, ntgen, was, married, to, anna, bertha, ludwig, for, 47, years, until, her, death, in, 1919, at, the, age, of, 80, in, 1866, they, met, in, z, rich, at, anna, s, father, s, caf, zum, gr, nen, glas, they, became, engaged, in, 1869, and, wed, in, apeldoorn, netherlands, on, 7, july, 1872, the, delay, was, due, to, anna, being, six, years, wilhelm, s, senior, and, his, father, not, approving, of, her, age, or, humble, background, their, marriage, began, with, financial, difficulties, as, family, support, from, r, ntgen, had, ceased, they, raised, one, child, josephine, bertha, ludwig, whom, they, adopted, as, a, six, year, old, after, her, father, anna, s, only, brother, died, in, 1887, for, ethical, reasons, r, ntgen, did, not, seek, patents, for, his, discoveries, holding, the, view, that, they, should, be, publicly, available, without, charge, after, receiving, his, nobel, prize, money, r, ntgen, donated, the, 50, 000, swedish, krona, to, research, at, the, university, of, w, rzburg, although, he, accepted, the, honorary, degree, of, doctor, of, medicine, he, rejected, an, offer, of, lower, nobility, or, niederer, adelstitel, denying, the, preposition, von, meaning, of, as, a, nobiliary, particle, i, e, von, r, ntgen, with, the, inflation, following, world, war, i, r, ntgen, fell, into, bankruptcy, spending, his, final, years, at, his, country, home, at, weilheim, near, munich, r, ntgen, died, on, 10, february, 1923, from, carcinoma, of, the, intestine, also, known, as, colorectal, cancer, in, keeping, with, his, will, his, personal, and, scientific, correspondence, with, few, exceptions, were, destroyed, upon, his, death, 113, he, was, member, in, the, dutch, reformed, church, in, 1901, r, ntgen, was, awarded, the, first, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, award, was, officially, in, recognition, of, the, extraordinary, services, he, has, rendered, by, the, discovery, of, the, remarkable, rays, subsequently, named, after, him, shy, in, public, speaking, he, declined, to, give, a, nobel, lecture, 39, r, ntgen, donated, the, 50, 000, swedish, krona, reward, from, his, nobel, prize, to, research, at, his, university, the, university, of, w, rzburg, like, marie, and, pierre, curie, r, ntgen, refused, to, take, out, patents, related, to, his, discovery, of, x, rays, as, he, wanted, society, as, a, whole, to, benefit, from, practical, applications, of, the, phenomenon, r, ntgen, was, also, awarded, barnard, medal, for, meritorious, service, to, science, in, 1900, in, november, 2004, iupac, named, element, number, 111, roentgenium, rg, in, his, honor, iupap, adopted, the, name, in, november, 2011, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1897, in, 1907, he, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, a, collection, of, his, papers, is, held, at, the, national, library, of, medicine, in, bethesda, maryland, today, in, remscheid, lennep, 40, kilometres, east, of, r, ntgen, s, birthplace, in, d, sseldorf, is, the, deutsches, r, ntgen, museum, in, w, rzburg, where, he, discovered, x, rays, a, non, profit, organization, maintains, his, laboratory, and, provides, guided, tours, to, the, r, ntgen, memorial, site, world, radiography, day, world, radiography, day, is, an, annual, event, promoting, the, role, of, medical, imaging, in, modern, healthcare, it, is, celebrated, on, 8, november, each, year, coinciding, with, the, anniversary, of, the, r, ntgen, s, discovery, it, was, first, introduced, in, 2012, as, a, joint, initiative, between, the, european, society, of, radiology, the, radiological, society, of, north, america, and, the, american, college, of, radiology, up, to, 2023, 55, stamps, from, 40, countries, have, been, issued, commemorating, r, ntgen, as, the, discoverer, of, x, rays, r, ntgen, peak, in, antarctica, is, named, after, wilhelm, r, ntgen,
