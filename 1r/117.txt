ferdinand, victor, eug, ne, delacroix, d, l, k, r, w, d, l, k, r, w, del, krwah, krwah, french, 26, april, 1798, 13, august, 1863, was, a, french, romantic, artist, who, was, regarded, as, the, leader, of, the, french, romantic, school, in, contrast, to, the, neoclassical, perfectionism, of, his, chief, rival, ingres, delacroix, took, for, his, inspiration, the, art, of, rubens, and, painters, of, the, venetian, renaissance, with, an, attendant, emphasis, on, colour, and, movement, rather, than, clarity, of, outline, and, carefully, modelled, form, dramatic, and, romantic, content, characterized, the, central, themes, of, his, maturity, and, led, him, not, to, the, classical, models, of, greek, and, roman, art, but, to, travel, in, north, africa, in, search, of, the, exotic, friend, and, spiritual, heir, to, th, odore, g, ricault, delacroix, was, also, inspired, by, lord, byron, with, whom, he, shared, a, strong, identification, with, the, forces, of, the, sublime, of, nature, in, often, violent, action, however, delacroix, was, given, to, neither, sentimentality, nor, bombast, and, his, romanticism, was, that, of, an, individualist, in, the, words, of, baudelaire, delacroix, was, passionately, in, love, with, passion, but, coldly, determined, to, express, passion, as, clearly, as, possible, together, with, ingres, delacroix, is, considered, one, of, the, last, old, masters, of, painting, and, is, one, of, the, few, who, was, ever, photographed, as, a, painter, and, muralist, delacroix, s, use, of, expressive, brushstrokes, and, his, study, of, the, optical, effects, of, colour, profoundly, shaped, the, work, of, the, impressionists, while, his, passion, for, the, exotic, inspired, the, artists, of, the, symbolist, movement, a, fine, lithographer, delacroix, illustrated, various, works, of, william, shakespeare, the, scottish, author, walter, scott, and, the, german, author, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, eug, ne, delacroix, was, born, on, 26, april, 1798, at, charenton, saint, maurice, in, le, de, france, near, paris, his, mother, was, victoire, oeben, the, daughter, of, the, cabinetmaker, jean, fran, ois, oeben, he, had, three, much, older, siblings, charles, henri, delacroix, 1779, 1845, rose, to, the, rank, of, general, in, napoleon, s, army, henriette, 1780, 1827, married, the, diplomat, raymond, de, verninac, saint, maur, 1762, 1822, henri, was, born, six, years, later, he, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, friedland, on, 14, june, 1807, there, are, medical, reasons, to, believe, that, eug, ne, s, legal, father, charles, fran, ois, delacroix, was, not, able, to, procreate, at, the, time, of, eug, ne, s, conception, talleyrand, who, was, a, friend, of, the, family, and, successor, of, charles, delacroix, as, minister, of, foreign, affairs, and, whom, the, adult, eug, ne, resembled, in, appearance, and, character, considered, himself, as, his, real, father, after, assuming, his, office, as, foreign, minister, talleyrand, dispatched, delacroix, to, the, hague, in, the, capacity, of, french, ambassador, to, the, then, batavian, republic, delacroix, who, at, the, time, suffered, from, erectile, dysfunction, returned, to, paris, in, early, september, 1797, only, to, find, his, wife, pregnant, talleyrand, went, on, to, assist, eug, ne, in, the, form, of, numerous, anonymous, commissions, throughout, his, career, as, a, painter, he, was, protected, by, talleyrand, who, served, successively, the, restoration, and, king, louis, philippe, and, ultimately, as, ambassador, of, france, in, great, britain, and, later, by, charles, auguste, louis, joseph, duc, de, morny, half, brother, of, napoleon, iii, grandson, of, talleyrand, and, speaker, of, the, french, house, of, commons, his, legitimate, father, charles, delacroix, died, in, 1805, and, his, mother, in, 1814, leaving, 16, year, old, eug, ne, an, orphan, his, early, education, was, at, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, and, at, the, lyc, e, pierre, corneille, in, rouen, where, he, steeped, himself, in, the, classics, and, won, awards, for, drawing, in, 1815, he, began, his, training, with, pierre, narcisse, gu, rin, in, the, neoclassical, style, of, jacques, louis, david, an, early, church, commission, the, virgin, of, the, harvest, 1819, displays, a, raphael, esque, influence, but, another, such, commission, the, virgin, of, the, sacred, heart, 1821, evidences, a, freer, interpretation, it, precedes, the, influence, of, the, more, colourful, and, rich, style, of, the, flemish, baroque, painter, peter, paul, rubens, and, fellow, french, artist, th, odore, g, ricault, whose, works, marked, an, introduction, to, romanticism, in, art, the, impact, of, g, ricault, s, the, raft, of, the, medusa, was, profound, and, stimulated, delacroix, to, produce, his, first, major, painting, the, barque, of, dante, which, was, accepted, by, the, paris, salon, in, 1822, the, work, caused, a, sensation, and, was, largely, derided, by, the, public, and, officialdom, yet, was, purchased, by, the, state, for, the, luxembourg, galleries, the, pattern, of, widespread, opposition, to, his, work, countered, by, a, vigorous, enlightened, support, would, continue, throughout, his, life, two, years, later, he, again, achieved, popular, success, for, his, the, massacre, at, chios, delacroix, s, painting, of, chios, massacre, during, the, greek, civil, wars, of, 1823, 1825, shows, dying, greek, civilians, rounded, up, for, enslavement, by, the, ottoman, empire, this, is, one, of, several, paintings, he, made, of, contemporary, events, expressing, the, official, policy, for, the, greek, cause, in, greek, war, of, independence, against, the, turks, the, english, the, russians, and, the, french, governments, delacroix, was, quickly, recognized, by, the, authorities, as, a, leading, painter, in, the, new, romantic, style, and, the, picture, was, bought, by, the, state, his, depiction, of, suffering, was, controversial, however, as, there, was, no, glorious, event, taking, place, no, patriots, raising, their, swords, in, valour, as, in, david, s, oath, of, the, horatii, only, a, disaster, many, critics, deplored, the, painting, s, despairing, tone, the, artist, antoine, jean, gros, called, it, a, massacre, of, art, the, pathos, in, the, depiction, of, an, infant, clutching, its, dead, mother, had, an, especially, powerful, effect, although, this, detail, was, condemned, as, unfit, for, art, by, delacroix, s, critics, a, viewing, of, the, paintings, of, john, constable, and, the, watercolour, sketches, and, art, of, richard, parkes, bonnington, prompted, delacroix, to, make, extensive, freely, painted, changes, to, the, sky, and, distant, landscape, delacroix, produced, a, second, painting, in, support, of, the, greeks, in, their, war, for, independence, this, time, referring, to, the, capture, of, missolonghi, by, turkish, forces, in, 1825, with, a, restraint, of, palette, appropriate, to, the, allegory, greece, expiring, on, the, ruins, of, missolonghi, displays, a, woman, in, greek, costume, with, her, breast, bared, arms, half, raised, in, an, imploring, gesture, before, the, horrible, scene, the, suicide, of, the, greeks, who, chose, to, kill, themselves, and, destroy, their, city, rather, than, surrender, to, the, turks, a, hand, is, seen, at, the, bottom, the, body, having, been, crushed, by, rubble, the, painting, serves, as, a, monument, to, the, people, of, missolonghi, and, to, the, idea, of, freedom, against, tyrannical, rule, this, event, interested, delacroix, not, only, for, his, sympathies, with, the, greeks, but, also, because, the, poet, byron, whom, delacroix, greatly, admired, had, died, there, a, trip, to, england, in, 1825, included, visits, to, thomas, lawrence, and, richard, parkes, bonington, and, the, colour, and, handling, of, english, painting, provided, impetus, for, his, only, full, length, portrait, the, elegant, portrait, of, louis, auguste, schwiter, 1826, 30, at, roughly, the, same, time, delacroix, was, creating, romantic, works, of, numerous, themes, many, of, which, would, continue, to, interest, him, for, over, thirty, years, by, 1825, he, was, producing, lithographs, illustrating, shakespeare, and, soon, thereafter, lithographs, and, paintings, from, goethe, s, faust, paintings, such, as, the, combat, of, the, giaour, and, hassan, 1826, and, woman, with, parrot, 1827, introduced, subjects, of, violence, and, sensuality, which, would, prove, to, be, recurrent, these, various, romantic, strands, came, together, in, the, death, of, sardanapalus, 1827, 28, delacroix, s, painting, of, the, death, of, the, assyrian, king, sardanapalus, shows, an, emotionally, stirring, scene, alive, with, colours, exotic, costumes, and, tragic, events, the, death, of, sardanapalus, depicts, the, besieged, king, watching, impassively, as, guards, carry, out, his, orders, to, kill, his, servants, concubines, and, animals, the, literary, source, is, a, play, by, byron, although, the, play, does, not, specifically, mention, any, massacre, of, concubines, sardanapalus, attitude, of, calm, detachment, is, a, familiar, pose, in, romantic, imagery, in, this, period, in, europe, the, painting, which, was, not, exhibited, again, for, many, years, afterward, has, been, regarded, by, some, critics, as, a, gruesome, fantasy, involving, death, and, lust, especially, shocking, is, the, struggle, of, a, nude, woman, whose, throat, is, about, to, be, cut, a, scene, placed, prominently, in, the, foreground, for, maximum, impact, however, the, sensuous, beauty, and, exotic, colours, of, the, composition, make, the, picture, appear, pleasing, and, shocking, at, the, same, time, a, variety, of, romantic, interests, were, again, synthesized, in, the, murder, of, the, bishop, of, li, ge, 1829, it, also, borrowed, from, a, literary, source, this, time, scott, and, depicts, a, scene, from, the, middle, ages, that, of, the, murder, of, louis, de, bourbon, bishop, of, li, ge, amidst, an, orgy, sponsored, by, his, captor, william, de, la, marck, set, in, an, immense, vaulted, interior, which, delacroix, based, on, sketches, of, the, palais, de, justice, in, rouen, and, westminster, hall, the, drama, plays, out, in, chiaroscuro, organized, around, a, brilliantly, lit, stretch, of, tablecloth, in, 1855, a, critic, described, the, painting, s, vibrant, handling, as, less, finished, than, a, painting, more, finished, than, a, sketch, the, murder, of, the, bishop, of, li, ge, was, left, by, the, painter, at, that, supreme, moment, when, one, more, stroke, of, the, brush, would, have, ruined, everything, delacroix, s, most, influential, work, came, in, 1830, with, the, painting, liberty, leading, the, people, which, for, choice, of, subject, and, technique, highlights, the, differences, between, the, romantic, approach, and, the, neoclassical, style, less, obviously, it, also, differs, from, the, romanticism, of, g, ricault, as, exemplified, by, the, raft, of, the, medusa, delacroix, felt, his, composition, more, vividly, as, a, whole, thought, of, his, figures, and, crowds, as, types, and, dominated, them, by, the, symbolic, figure, of, republican, liberty, which, is, one, of, his, finest, plastic, inventions, probably, delacroix, s, best, known, painting, liberty, leading, the, people, is, an, unforgettable, image, of, parisians, having, taken, up, arms, marching, forward, under, the, banner, of, the, tricolour, representing, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, although, delacroix, was, inspired, by, contemporary, events, to, invoke, this, romantic, image, of, the, spirit, of, liberty, he, seems, to, be, trying, to, convey, the, will, and, character, of, the, people, rather, than, glorifying, the, actual, event, the, 1830, revolution, against, charles, x, which, did, little, other, than, bring, a, different, king, louis, philippe, i, to, power, the, warriors, lying, dead, in, the, foreground, offer, poignant, counterpoint, to, the, symbolic, female, figure, who, is, illuminated, triumphantly, against, a, background, of, smoke, although, the, french, government, bought, the, painting, by, 1832, officials, deemed, its, glorification, of, liberty, too, inflammatory, and, removed, it, from, public, view, nonetheless, delacroix, still, received, many, government, commissions, for, murals, and, ceiling, paintings, following, the, revolution, of, 1848, that, saw, the, end, of, the, reign, of, king, louis, philippe, delacroix, painting, liberty, leading, the, people, was, finally, put, on, display, by, the, newly, elected, president, louis, napoleon, napoleon, iii, it, is, exhibited, in, the, louvre, museum, in, paris, although, from, december, 2012, until, 2014, it, was, on, exhibit, at, louvre, lens, in, lens, pas, de, calais, the, boy, holding, a, pistol, aloft, on, the, right, is, sometimes, thought, to, be, an, inspiration, for, the, gavroche, character, in, victor, hugo, s, 1862, novel, les, mis, rables, delacroix, painted, hundreds, of, religious, works, in, his, lifetime, and, had, a, strong, interest, in, christianity, he, had, many, commissions, for, religious, paintings, including, pieces, for, the, saints, anges, chapel, of, saint, sulpice, in, paris, his, religious, paintings, and, style, would, shift, drastically, depending, on, the, needs, of, the, commission, some, of, his, religious, works, such, as, christ, on, the, sea, of, galilee, had, multiple, painted, versions, delacroix, s, piet, a, painting, of, the, virgin, mary, mourning, christ, after, his, death, was, eventually, redone, by, vincent, van, gogh, delacroix, reflected, on, religion, through, his, paintings, and, his, religious, works, often, show, subtle, details, to, biblical, texts, while, considered, an, unbeliever, or, agnostic, his, journal, and, paintings, reveal, an, openness, and, receptiveness, to, spirituality, through, his, art, in, 1832, delacroix, traveled, to, spain, and, north, africa, in, company, with, the, diplomat, charles, edgar, de, mornay, as, part, of, a, diplomatic, mission, to, morocco, shortly, after, the, french, conquered, algeria, he, went, not, primarily, to, study, art, but, to, escape, from, the, civilization, of, paris, in, hopes, of, seeing, a, more, primitive, culture, he, eventually, produced, over, 100, paintings, and, drawings, of, scenes, from, or, based, on, the, life, of, the, people, of, north, africa, and, added, a, new, and, personal, chapter, to, the, interest, in, orientalism, delacroix, was, entranced, by, the, people, and, their, clothes, and, the, trip, would, inform, the, subject, matter, of, a, great, many, of, his, future, paintings, he, believed, that, the, north, africans, in, their, attire, and, their, attitudes, provided, a, visual, equivalent, to, the, people, of, classical, rome, and, greece, the, greeks, and, romans, are, here, at, my, door, in, the, arabs, who, wrap, themselves, in, a, white, blanket, and, look, like, cato, or, brutus, he, managed, to, sketch, some, women, secretly, in, algiers, as, in, the, painting, women, of, algiers, in, their, apartment, 1834, but, generally, he, encountered, difficulty, in, finding, muslim, women, to, pose, for, him, because, of, muslim, rules, requiring, that, women, be, covered, less, problematic, was, the, painting, of, jewish, women, in, north, africa, as, subjects, for, the, jewish, wedding, in, morocco, 1837, 1841, while, in, tangier, delacroix, made, many, sketches, of, the, people, and, the, city, subjects, to, which, he, would, return, until, the, end, of, his, life, animals, the, embodiment, of, romantic, passion, were, incorporated, into, paintings, such, as, arab, horses, fighting, in, a, stable, 1860, the, lion, hunt, of, which, there, exist, many, versions, painted, between, 1856, and, 1861, and, arab, saddling, his, horse, 1855, delacroix, drew, inspiration, from, many, sources, over, his, career, such, as, the, literary, works, of, william, shakespeare, and, lord, byron, and, the, artistry, of, michelangelo, but, throughout, his, life, he, felt, a, constant, need, for, music, saying, in, 1855, that, nothing, can, be, compared, with, the, emotion, caused, by, music, that, it, expresses, incomparable, shades, of, feeling, he, also, said, while, working, at, saint, sulpice, that, music, put, him, in, a, state, of, exaltation, that, inspired, his, painting, it, was, often, from, music, whether, the, most, melancholy, renditions, of, chopin, or, the, pastoral, works, of, beethoven, that, delacroix, was, able, to, draw, the, most, emotion, and, inspiration, at, one, point, during, his, life, delacroix, befriended, and, made, portraits, of, the, composer, chopin, in, his, journal, delacroix, praised, him, frequently, in, 1838, delacroix, exhibited, medea, about, to, kill, her, children, which, created, a, sensation, at, the, salon, his, first, large, scale, treatment, of, a, scene, from, greek, mythology, the, painting, depicts, medea, clutching, her, children, dagger, drawn, to, slay, them, in, vengeance, for, her, abandonment, by, jason, the, three, nude, figures, form, an, animated, pyramid, bathed, in, a, raking, light, that, penetrates, the, grotto, in, which, medea, has, hidden, though, the, painting, was, quickly, purchased, by, the, state, delacroix, was, disappointed, when, it, was, sent, to, the, lille, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, he, had, intended, for, it, to, hang, at, the, luxembourg, where, it, would, have, joined, the, barque, of, dante, and, scenes, from, the, massacres, of, chios, from, 1833, on, delacroix, received, numerous, commissions, to, decorate, public, buildings, in, paris, in, that, year, he, began, work, for, the, salon, du, roi, in, the, chambre, des, d, put, s, palais, bourbon, which, was, not, completed, until, 1837, and, began, a, lifelong, friendship, with, the, female, artist, marie, lisabeth, blavot, boulanger, for, the, next, ten, years, he, painted, in, both, the, library, at, the, palais, bourbon, and, the, library, at, the, palais, du, luxembourg, in, 1843, he, decorated, the, church, of, st, denis, du, saint, sacrement, with, a, large, piet, and, from, 1848, to, 1850, he, painted, the, ceiling, in, the, galerie, d, apollon, of, the, louvre, from, 1857, to, 1861, he, worked, on, frescoes, for, the, chapelle, des, anges, at, the, church, of, saint, sulpice, in, paris, they, included, jacob, wrestling, with, the, angel, saint, michael, slaying, the, dragon, and, the, expulsion, of, heliodorus, from, the, temple, these, commissions, offered, him, the, opportunity, to, compose, on, a, large, scale, in, an, architectural, setting, much, as, had, those, masters, he, admired, paolo, veronese, tintoretto, and, rubens, the, work, was, fatiguing, and, during, these, years, he, suffered, from, an, increasingly, fragile, constitution, in, addition, to, his, home, in, paris, from, 1844, he, also, lived, at, a, small, cottage, in, champrosay, where, he, found, respite, in, the, countryside, from, 1834, until, his, death, he, was, faithfully, cared, for, by, his, housekeeper, jeanne, marie, le, guillou, who, zealously, guarded, his, privacy, and, whose, devotion, prolonged, his, life, and, his, ability, to, continue, working, in, his, later, years, in, 1862, delacroix, participated, in, the, creation, of, the, soci, t, nationale, des, beaux, arts, his, friend, the, writer, th, ophile, gautier, became, chairman, with, the, painter, aim, millet, acting, as, deputy, chairman, in, addition, to, delacroix, the, committee, was, composed, of, the, painters, carrier, belleuse, and, puvis, de, chavannes, among, the, exhibitors, were, l, on, bonnat, jean, baptiste, carpeaux, charles, fran, ois, daubigny, gustave, dor, and, douard, manet, just, after, his, death, in, 1863, the, society, organized, a, retrospective, exhibition, of, 248, paintings, and, lithographs, by, delacroix, and, ceased, to, mount, any, further, exhibitions, the, winter, of, 1862, 63, was, extremely, rough, for, delacroix, he, was, suffering, from, a, bad, throat, infection, that, seemed, to, get, worse, over, the, course, of, the, season, on, a, trip, to, champrosay, he, met, a, friend, on, the, train, and, became, exhausted, after, having, a, conversation, on, 1, june, he, returned, to, paris, to, see, his, doctor, two, weeks, later, on, 16, june, he, was, getting, better, and, returned, to, his, house, in, the, country, but, by, 15, july, he, was, sick, enough, to, again, see, his, doctor, who, said, he, could, do, nothing, more, for, him, by, then, the, only, food, he, could, eat, was, fruit, delacroix, realized, the, seriousness, of, his, condition, and, wrote, his, will, leaving, a, gift, for, each, of, his, friends, for, his, trusted, housekeeper, jenny, le, guillou, he, left, enough, money, for, her, to, live, on, while, ordering, everything, in, his, studio, to, be, sold, he, also, inserted, a, clause, forbidding, any, representation, of, his, features, whether, by, a, death, mask, or, by, drawing, or, by, photography, i, forbid, it, expressly, on, 13, august, delacroix, died, with, jenny, by, his, side, he, was, buried, in, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, his, house, formerly, situated, along, the, canal, of, the, marne, is, now, near, the, exit, of, the, motorway, leading, from, paris, to, central, germany, at, the, sale, of, his,

number, and, quality, of, the, drawings, whether, done, for, constructive, purposes, or, to, capture, a, spontaneous, movement, underscored, his, explanation, colour, always, occupies, me, but, drawing, preoccupies, me, delacroix, produced, several, fine, self, portraits, and, a, number, of, memorable, portraits, which, seem, to, have, been, done, purely, for, pleasure, among, which, were, the, portrait, of, fellow, artist, baron, schwiter, an, inspired, small, oil, of, the, violinist, niccol, paganini, and, portrait, of, fr, d, ric, chopin, and, george, sand, a, double, portrait, of,
