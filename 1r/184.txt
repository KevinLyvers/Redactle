sir, christopher, wren, frs, r, n, 30, october, 1632, 8, march, 1723, was, an, english, architect, astronomer, mathematician, and, physicist, who, was, one, of, the, most, highly, acclaimed, architects, in, the, history, of, england, known, for, his, work, in, the, english, baroque, style, he, was, accorded, responsibility, for, rebuilding, 52, churches, in, the, city, of, london, after, the, great, fire, in, 1666, including, what, is, regarded, as, his, masterpiece, st, paul, s, cathedral, on, ludgate, hill, completed, in, 1710, the, principal, creative, responsibility, for, a, number, of, the, churches, is, now, more, commonly, attributed, to, others, in, his, office, especially, nicholas, hawksmoor, other, notable, buildings, by, wren, include, the, royal, hospital, chelsea, the, old, royal, naval, college, greenwich, and, the, south, front, of, hampton, court, palace, educated, in, latin, and, aristotelian, physics, at, the, university, of, oxford, wren, was, a, founder, of, the, royal, society, and, served, as, its, president, from, 1680, to, 1682, his, scientific, work, was, highly, regarded, by, isaac, newton, and, blaise, pascal, wren, was, born, in, east, knoyle, in, wiltshire, the, only, surviving, son, of, christopher, wren, the, elder, 1589, 1658, and, mary, cox, the, only, child, of, the, wiltshire, squire, robert, cox, from, fonthill, bishop, christopher, sr, was, at, that, time, the, rector, of, east, knoyle, and, later, dean, of, windsor, it, was, while, they, were, living, at, east, knoyle, that, all, their, children, were, born, mary, catherine, and, susan, were, all, born, by, 1628, but, then, several, children, who, were, born, died, within, a, few, weeks, of, their, birth, their, son, christopher, was, born, in, 1632, then, two, years, later, another, daughter, named, elizabeth, was, born, mary, must, have, died, shortly, after, the, birth, of, elizabeth, although, there, does, not, appear, to, be, any, surviving, record, of, the, date, through, mary, cox, however, the, family, became, well, off, financially, for, as, the, only, heir, she, had, inherited, her, father, s, estate, as, a, child, wren, seem, d, consumptive, although, a, sickly, child, he, would, survive, into, robust, old, age, he, was, first, taught, at, home, by, a, private, tutor, and, his, father, after, his, father, s, royal, appointment, as, dean, of, windsor, in, march, 1635, his, family, spent, part, of, each, year, there, but, little, is, known, about, wren, s, life, at, windsor, he, spent, his, first, eight, years, at, east, knoyle, and, was, educated, by, the, rev, william, shepherd, a, local, clergyman, little, is, known, of, wren, s, schooling, thereafter, during, dangerous, times, when, his, father, s, royal, associations, would, have, required, the, family, to, keep, a, very, low, profile, from, the, ruling, parliamentary, authorities, it, was, a, tough, time, in, his, life, but, one, which, would, go, on, to, have, a, significant, impact, upon, his, later, works, the, story, that, he, was, at, westminster, school, between, 1641, and, 1646, is, substantiated, only, by, parentalia, the, biography, compiled, by, his, son, a, fourth, christopher, which, places, him, there, for, some, short, time, before, going, up, to, oxford, in, 1650, however, it, is, entirely, consistent, with, headmaster, doctor, busby, s, well, documented, practice, of, educating, the, sons, of, impoverished, royalists, and, puritans, alike, irrespective, of, current, politics, or, his, own, position, some, of, wren, s, youthful, exercises, preserved, or, recorded, though, few, are, datable, showed, that, he, received, a, thorough, grounding, in, latin, and, also, learned, to, draw, according, to, parentalia, he, was, initiated, in, the, principles, of, mathematics, by, william, holder, who, married, wren, s, elder, sister, susan, or, susanna, in, 1643, his, drawing, was, put, to, academic, use, in, providing, many, of, the, anatomical, drawings, for, the, anatomy, textbook, of, the, brain, cerebri, anatome, 1664, published, by, thomas, willis, who, coined, the, term, neurology, during, this, time, period, wren, became, interested, in, the, design, and, construction, of, mechanical, instruments, it, was, probably, through, holder, that, wren, met, sir, charles, scarburgh, whom, wren, assisted, in, his, anatomical, studies, another, sister, anne, brunsell, married, a, clergyman, and, is, buried, in, stretham, on, 25, june, 1650, wren, entered, wadham, college, oxford, where, he, studied, latin, and, the, works, of, aristotle, it, is, anachronistic, to, imagine, that, he, received, scientific, training, in, the, modern, sense, however, wren, became, closely, associated, with, john, wilkins, the, warden, of, wadham, the, wilkins, circle, was, a, group, whose, activities, led, to, the, formation, of, the, royal, society, comprising, a, number, of, distinguished, mathematicians, creative, workers, and, experimental, philosophers, this, connection, probably, influenced, wren, s, studies, of, science, and, mathematics, at, oxford, he, graduated, b, a, in, 1651, and, two, years, later, received, m, a, after, receiving, his, m, a, in, 1653, wren, was, elected, a, fellow, of, all, souls, college, in, the, same, year, and, began, an, active, period, of, research, and, experiment, in, oxford, among, these, were, a, number, of, physiological, experiments, on, dogs, including, one, now, recognized, as, the, first, injection, of, fluids, into, the, bloodstream, of, a, live, animal, under, laboratory, conditions, at, oxford, he, became, part, of, the, group, around, john, wilkins, he, was, key, to, the, correspondence, network, known, as, the, invisible, college, within, the, arms, of, all, souls, the, arms, of, wren, s, friend, robert, boyle, appear, in, the, colonnade, of, the, great, quadrangle, opposite, the, arms, of, the, hill, family, of, shropshire, close, by, a, sundial, designed, by, boyle, s, friend, wren, his, days, as, a, fellow, of, all, souls, ended, when, wren, was, appointed, professor, of, astronomy, at, gresham, college, london, in, 1657, he, was, there, provided, with, a, set, of, rooms, and, a, stipend, and, required, to, give, weekly, lectures, in, both, latin, and, english, wren, took, up, this, new, work, with, enthusiasm, he, continued, to, meet, the, men, with, whom, he, had, frequent, discussions, in, oxford, they, attended, his, london, lectures, and, in, 1660, initiated, formal, weekly, meetings, it, was, from, these, meetings, that, the, royal, society, england, s, premier, scientific, body, was, to, develop, he, undoubtedly, played, a, major, role, in, the, early, life, of, what, would, become, the, royal, society, his, great, breadth, of, expertise, in, so, many, different, subjects, helped, in, the, exchange, of, ideas, between, the, various, scientists, in, fact, the, report, on, one, of, these, meetings, reads, memorandum, november, 28, 1660, these, persons, following, according, to, the, usual, custom, of, most, of, them, met, together, at, gresham, college, to, hear, mr, wren, s, lecture, viz, the, lord, brouncker, mr, boyle, mr, bruce, sir, robert, moray, sir, paule, neile, dr, wilkins, dr, goddard, dr, petty, mr, ball, mr, rooke, mr, wren, mr, hill, and, after, the, lecture, was, ended, they, did, according, to, the, usual, manner, withdraw, for, mutual, converse, in, 1662, they, proposed, a, society, for, the, promotion, of, physico, mathematicall, experimental, learning, this, body, received, its, royal, charter, from, charles, ii, and, the, royal, society, of, london, for, improving, natural, knowledge, was, formed, in, addition, to, being, a, founder, member, of, the, society, wren, was, president, of, the, royal, society, from, 1680, to, 1682, in, 1661, wren, was, elected, savilian, professor, of, astronomy, at, oxford, and, in, 1669, he, was, appointed, surveyor, of, works, to, charles, ii, from, 1661, until, 1668, wren, s, life, was, based, in, oxford, although, his, attendance, at, meetings, of, the, royal, society, meant, that, he, had, to, make, periodic, trips, to, london, the, main, sources, for, wren, s, scientific, achievements, are, the, records, of, the, royal, society, his, scientific, works, ranged, from, astronomy, optics, the, problem, of, finding, longitude, at, sea, cosmology, mechanics, microscopy, surveying, medicine, and, meteorology, he, observed, measured, dissected, built, models, and, employed, invented, and, improved, a, variety, of, instruments, it, was, probably, around, this, time, that, sir, christopher, wren, was, drawn, into, redesigning, a, battered, st, paul, s, cathedral, making, a, trip, to, paris, in, 1665, wren, studied, architecture, which, had, reached, a, climax, of, creativity, and, perused, the, drawings, of, bernini, the, great, italian, sculptor, and, architect, who, himself, was, visiting, paris, at, the, time, returning, from, paris, he, made, his, first, design, for, st, paul, s, a, week, later, however, the, great, fire, destroyed, two, thirds, of, the, city, wren, submitted, his, plans, for, rebuilding, the, city, to, king, charles, ii, although, they, were, never, adopted, with, his, appointment, as, king, s, surveyor, of, works, in, 1669, he, had, a, presence, in, the, general, process, of, rebuilding, the, city, but, was, not, directly, involved, with, the, rebuilding, of, houses, or, companies, halls, wren, was, personally, responsible, for, the, rebuilding, of, 51, churches, however, it, is, not, necessarily, true, to, say, that, each, of, them, represented, his, own, fully, developed, design, wren, was, knighted, on, 14, november, 1673, this, honour, was, bestowed, on, him, after, his, resignation, from, the, savilian, chair, in, oxford, by, which, time, he, had, already, begun, to, make, his, mark, as, an, architect, both, in, services, to, the, crown, and, in, playing, an, important, part, in, rebuilding, london, after, the, great, fire, additionally, he, was, sufficiently, active, in, public, affairs, to, be, returned, as, member, of, parliament, on, four, occasions, wren, first, stood, for, parliament, in, a, by, election, in, 1667, for, the, cambridge, university, constituency, losing, by, six, votes, to, sir, charles, wheler, he, was, unsuccessful, again, in, a, by, election, for, the, oxford, university, constituency, in, 1674, losing, to, thomas, thynne, at, his, third, attempt, wren, was, successful, and, he, sat, for, plympton, erle, during, the, loyal, parliament, of, 1685, to, 1687, wren, was, returned, for, new, windsor, on, 11, january, 1689, in, the, general, election, but, his, election, was, declared, void, on, 14, may, 1689, he, was, elected, again, for, new, windsor, on, 6, march, 1690, but, this, election, was, declared, void, on, 17, may, 1690, over, a, decade, later, he, was, elected, unopposed, for, weymouth, and, melcombe, regis, at, the, november, 1701, general, election, he, retired, at, the, general, election, the, following, year, wren, s, career, was, well, established, by, 1669, and, it, may, have, been, his, appointment, as, surveyor, of, the, king, s, works, early, that, year, that, persuaded, him, that, he, could, finally, afford, to, marry, in, 1669, the, 37, year, old, wren, married, his, childhood, neighbour, the, 33, year, old, faith, coghill, daughter, of, sir, john, coghill, of, bletchingdon, little, is, known, of, faith, but, a, love, letter, from, wren, survives, which, reads, in, part, i, have, sent, your, watch, at, last, envy, the, felicity, of, it, that, it, should, be, soe, near, your, side, soe, often, enjoy, your, eye, but, have, a, care, for, it, for, i, have, put, such, a, spell, into, it, that, every, beating, of, the, balance, will, tell, you, tis, the, pulse, of, my, heart, which, labors, as, much, to, serve, you, and, more, trewly, than, the, watch, for, the, watch, i, beleeve, will, sometimes, lie, and, sometimes, be, idle, unwilling, but, as, for, me, you, may, be, confident, i, shall, never, this, brief, marriage, produced, two, children, gilbert, born, october, 1672, who, suffered, from, convulsions, and, died, at, about, 18, months, old, and, christopher, born, february, 1675, the, younger, christopher, was, trained, by, his, father, to, be, an, architect, it, was, this, christopher, that, supervised, the, topping, out, ceremony, of, st, paul, s, in, 1710, and, wrote, the, famous, parentalia, or, memoirs, of, the, family, of, the, wrens, faith, wren, died, of, smallpox, on, 3, september, 1675, she, was, buried, in, the, chancel, of, st, martin, in, the, fields, beside, the, infant, gilbert, a, few, days, later, wren, s, mother, in, law, lady, coghill, arrived, to, take, the, infant, christopher, back, with, her, to, oxfordshire, to, raise, in, 1677, 17, months, after, the, death, of, his, first, wife, wren, remarried, this, time, to, jane, fitzwilliam, daughter, of, william, fitzwilliam, 2nd, baron, fitzwilliam, and, his, wife, jane, perry, the, daughter, of, a, prosperous, london, merchant, she, was, a, mystery, to, wren, s, friends, and, companions, robert, hooke, who, often, saw, wren, two, or, three, times, every, week, had, as, he, recorded, in, his, diary, never, even, heard, of, her, and, was, not, to, meet, her, till, six, weeks, after, the, marriage, as, with, the, first, marriage, this, too, produced, two, children, a, daughter, jane, 1677, 1702, and, a, son, william, poor, billy, born, june, 1679, who, was, developmentally, delayed, like, the, first, this, second, marriage, was, also, brief, jane, wren, died, of, tuberculosis, in, september, 1680, she, was, buried, alongside, faith, and, gilbert, in, the, chancel, of, st, martin, in, the, fields, wren, was, never, to, marry, again, he, lived, to, be, over, 90, years, old, and, of, those, years, was, married, only, nine, bletchingdon, was, the, home, of, wren, s, brother, in, law, william, holder, who, was, rector, of, the, local, church, holder, had, been, a, fellow, of, pembroke, college, oxford, an, intellectual, of, considerable, ability, he, is, said, to, have, been, the, figure, who, introduced, wren, to, arithmetic, and, geometry, wren, s, later, life, was, not, without, criticisms, and, attacks, on, his, competence, and, his, taste, in, 1712, the, letter, concerning, design, of, anthony, ashley, cooper, third, earl, of, shaftesbury, circulated, in, manuscript, proposing, a, new, british, style, of, architecture, shaftesbury, censured, wren, s, cathedral, his, taste, and, his, long, standing, control, of, royal, works, although, wren, was, appointed, to, the, fifty, new, churches, commission, in, 1711, he, was, left, only, with, nominal, charge, of, a, board, of, works, when, the, surveyorship, started, in, 1715, on, 26, april, 1718, on, the, pretext, of, failing, powers, he, was, dismissed, in, favour, of, william, benson, in, 1713, he, bought, the, manor, of, wroxall, warwickshire, from, the, burgoyne, family, to, which, his, son, christopher, retired, in, 1716, after, losing, his, post, as, clerk, of, works, several, of, wren, s, descendants, would, be, buried, there, in, the, church, of, st, leonard, the, wren, family, estate, was, at, the, old, court, house, in, the, area, of, hampton, court, he, had, been, given, a, lease, on, the, property, by, queen, anne, in, lieu, of, salary, arrears, for, building, st, paul, s, for, convenience, wren, also, leased, a, house, on, st, james, s, street, in, london, according, to, a, 19th, century, legend, he, would, often, go, to, london, to, pay, unofficial, visits, to, st, paul, s, to, check, on, the, progress, of, my, greatest, work, on, one, of, these, trips, to, london, at, the, age, of, ninety, he, caught, a, cold, and, on, 25, february, 1723, a, servant, who, tried, to, awaken, wren, from, his, nap, found, that, he, had, died, in, his, sleep, wren, was, laid, to, rest, on, 5, march, 1723, his, body, was, placed, in, the, southeast, corner, of, the, crypt, of, st, paul, s, there, is, a, memorial, to, him, in, the, crypt, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, beside, those, of, his, daughter, jane, his, sister, susan, holder, and, her, husband, william, the, plain, stone, plaque, was, written, by, wren, s, eldest, son, and, heir, christopher, wren, the, younger, the, inscription, which, is, also, inscribed, in, a, circle, of, black, marble, on, the, main, floor, beneath, the, centre, of, the, dome, reads, subtus, conditur, huius, ecclesi, et, vrbis, conditor, christophorus, wren, qui, vixit, annos, ultra, nonaginta, non, sibi, sed, bono, publico, lector, si, monumentum, requiris, circumspice, obijt, xxv, feb, an, mdccxxiii, t, xci, which, translates, from, latin, as, here, in, its, foundations, lies, the, architect, of, this, church, and, city, christopher, wren, who, lived, beyond, ninety, years, not, for, his, own, profit, but, for, the, public, good, reader, if, you, seek, his, monument, look, around, you, died, 25, feb, 1723, age, 91, his, obituary, was, published, in, the, post, boy, no, 5244, london, 2, march, 1723, sir, christopher, wren, who, died, on, monday, last, in, the, 91st, year, of, his, age, was, the, only, son, of, dr, chr, wren, dean, of, windsor, wolverhampton, registar, of, the, garter, younger, brother, of, dr, mathew, sic, wren, ld, bp, of, ely, a, branch, of, the, ancient, family, of, wrens, of, binchester, in, the, bishoprick, of, durham, 1653, elected, from, wadham, into, fellowship, of, all, souls, 1657, professor, of, astronomy, gresham, college, london, 1660, savilian, professor, oxford, after, 1666, surveyor, general, for, rebuilding, the, cathedral, church, of, st, paul, and, the, parochial, churches, all, other, public, buildings, which, he, lived, to, finish, 1669, surveyor, general, till, april, 26, 1718, 1680, president, of, the, royal, society, 1698, surveyor, general, sub, commissioner, for, repairs, to, westminster, abbey, by, act, of, parliament, continued, till, death, his, body, is, to, be, deposited, in, the, great, vault, under, the, dome, of, the, cathedral, of, st, paul, the, curious, and, entire, libraries, of, sir, christopher, wren, and, of, his, son, were, auctioned, by, langford, and, cock, at, mr, cock, s, in, covent, garden, on, 24, 27, october, 1748, one, of, wren, s, friends, robert, hooke, scientist, and, architect, and, a, fellow, westminster, schoolboy, said, of, him, since, the, time, of, archimedes, there, scarce, ever, met, in, one, man, in, so, great, perfection, such, a, mechanical, hand, and, so, philosophical, mind, when, a, fellow, of, all, souls, wren, constructed, a, transparent, beehive, for, scientific, observation, he, began, observing, the, moon, which, was, to, lead, to, the, invention, of, micrometers, for, the, telescope, according, to, parentalia, pp, 210, 211, his, solid, model, of, the, moon, attracted, the, attention, of, the, king, who, commanded, wren, to, perfect, it, and, present, it, to, him, he, contrived, an, artificial, eye, truly, and, dioptrically, made, as, large, as, a, tennis, ball, representing, the, picture, as, nature, makes, it, the, cornea, and, crystalline, were, glass, the, other, humours, water, he, experimented, on, terrestrial, magnetism, and, had, taken, part, in, medical, experiments, while, at, wadham, college, performing, the, first, successful, injection, of, a, substance, into, the, bloodstream, of, a, dog, in, gresham, college, he, did, experiments, involving, determining, longitude, through, magnetic, variation, and, through, lunar, observation, to, help, with, navigation, and, helped, construct, a, 35, foot, 11, m, telescope, with, sir, paul, neile, wren, also, studied, and, improved, the, microscope, and, telescope, at, this, time, he, had, also, been, making, observations, of, the, planet, saturn, from, around, 1652, with, the, aim, of, explaining, its, appearance, his, hypothesis, was, written, up, in, de, corpore, saturni, but, before, the, work, was, published, huygens, presented, his, theory, of, the, rings, of, saturn, immediately, wren, recognised, this, as, a, better, hypothesis, than, his, own, and, de, corpore, saturni, was, never, published, in, addition, he, constructed, an, exquisitely, detailed, lunar, model, and, presented, it, to, the, king, in, 1658, he, found, the, length, of, an, arc, of, the, cycloid, using, an, exhaustion, proof, based, on, dissections, to, reduce, the, problem, to, summing, segments, of, chords, of, a, circle, which, are, in, geometric, progression, a, year, into, wren, s, appointment, as, a, savilian, professor, in, oxford, the, royal, society, was, created, and, wren, became, an, active, member, as, savilian, professor, wren, studied, mechanics, thoroughly, especially, elastic, collisions, and, pendulum, motions, he, also, directed, his, far, ranging, intelligence, to, the, study, of, meteorology, in, 1662, he, invented, the, tipping, bucket, rain, gauge, and, in, 1663, designed, a, weather, clock, that, would, record, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and, barometric, pressure, a, working, weather, clock, based, on, wren, s, design, was, completed, by, robert, hooke, in, 1679, in, addition, wren, experimented, on, muscle, functionality, hypothesizing, that, the, swelling, and, shrinking, of, muscles, might, proceed, from, a, fermentative, motion, arising, from, the, mixture, of, two, heterogeneous, fluids, although, this, is, incorrect, it, was, at, least, founded, upon, observation, and, may, mark, a, new, outlook, on, medicine, specialisation, another, topic, to, which, wren, contributed, was, optics, he, published, a, description, of, an, engine, to, create, perspective, drawings, and, he, discussed, the, grinding, of, conical, lenses, and, mirrors, out, of, this, work, came, another, of, wren, s, important, mathematical, results, namely, that, the, hyperboloid, of, revolution, is, a, ruled, surface, these, results, were, published, in, 1669, in, subsequent, years, wren, continued, with, his, work, with, the, royal, society, although, after, the, 1680s, his, scientific, interests, seem, to, have, waned, no, doubt, his, architectural, and, official, duties, absorbed, more, time, it, was, a, problem, posed, by, wren, that, serves, as, an, ultimate, source, to, the, conception, of, newton, s, principia, mathematica, philosophiae, naturalis, robert, hooke, had, theorised, that, planets, moving, in, vacuo, describe, orbits, around, the, sun, because, of, a, rectilinear, inertial, motion, by, the, tangent, and, an, accelerated, motion, towards, the, sun, wren, s, challenge, to, halley, and, hooke, for, the, reward, of, a, book, worth, thirty, shillings, was, to, provide, within, the, context, of, hooke, s, hypothesis, a, mathematical, theory, linking, kepler, s, laws, with, a, specific, force, law, halley, took, the, problem, to, newton, for, advice, prompting, the, latter, to, write, a, nine, page, answer, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, which, was, later, to, be, expanded, into, the, principia, mentioned, above, are, only, a, few, of, wren, s, scientific, works, he, also, studied, other, areas, ranging, from, agriculture, ballistics, water, and, freezing, light, and, refraction, to, name, only, a, few, thomas, birch, s, history, of, the, royal, society, 1756, 57, is, one, of, the, most, important, sources, of, our, knowledge, not, only, of, the, origins, of, the, society, but, also, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, society, it, is, in, these, records, that, most, of, wren, s, known, scientific, works, are, recorded, wren, was, a, prominent, man, of, science, at, the, height, of, the, scientific, revolution, the, scientific, revolution, seemed, to, promise, a, merger, of, the, science, of, mechanics, and, the, art, of, building, in, galileo, galilei, s, two, new, sciences, the, first, science, is, not, dynamics, for, which, the, book, is, now, better, known, but, rather, the, strength, of, materials, which, galileo, had, recognized, 30, years, earlier, as, a, science, that, is, very, necessary, in, making, machines, and, buildings, of, all, kinds, in, 1624, henry, wotton, the, british, ambassador, to, venice, published, a, book, on, architecture, in, which, he, analyzed, in, a, rudimentary, way, the, structure, of, a, stone, arch, moreover, in, the, 17th, century, it, was, people, who, would, now, be, called, scientists, who, were, awarded, the, commissions, to, design, and, build, monumental, structures, in, turin, guarino, guarini, a, mathematician, devised, the, plans, for, such, celebrated, buildings, as, the, royal, church, of, saint, lawrence, the, chapel, of, the, holy, shroud, and, the, palazzo, carignano, in, paris, claude, perrault, a, physician, and, an, anatomist, designed, the, fa, ade, of, the, louvre, and, the, observatory, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, london, it, was, wren, and, hooke, who, collaborated, as, chief, architect, and, city, surveyor, after, the, city, was, devastated, by, the, great, fire, of, 1666, in, 1661, just, months, after, taking, his, post, at, oxford, wren, was, invited, by, charles, ii, to, oversee, the, construction, of, new, harbour, defences, at, tangier, then, newly, under, british, control, wren, ultimately, excused, himself, from, the, king, s, offer, letters, dated, to, the, end, of, 1661, note, that, in, addition, to, the, tangier, project, charles, ii, had, also, sought, wren, for, consultation, regarding, repairs, to, old, st, paul, s, cathedral, the, reconstruction, of, which, would, ultimately, be, the, architect, s, magnum, opus, speaking, of, wren, s, vocational, transition, from, academic, to, architect, engineer, biographer, adrian, tinniswood, writes, the, use, of, mathematicians, in, military, fortification, was, not, unusual, perhaps, wren, also, had, experience, of, the, business, of, fortification, more, than, we, know, wren, s, first, known, foray, into, architecture, came, after, his, uncle, matthew, wren, bishop, of, ely, offered, to, finance, a, new, chapel, for, pembroke, college, cambridge, matthew, commissioned, his, nephew, for, the, design, finding, the, architecturally, inexperienced, christopher, to, be, both, ideologically, sympathetic, and, stylistically, deferential, wren, produced, his, design, in, the, winter, of, 1662, or, 1663, and, the, chapel, was, completed, in, 1665, wren, s, second, similarly, collegiate, work, followed, soon, after, when, he, was, commissioned, to, design, oxford, s, new, theatre, financed, by, gilbert, sheldon, his, design, for, the, structure, was, met, with, lukewarm, to, negative, reception, with, even, wren, s, defenders, admitting, the, young, architect, to, have, not, yet, been, capable, of, handling, a, large, architectural, composition, with, assurance, adrian, tinniswood, credits, the, building, s, flaws, to, sheldon, s, refusal, to, pay, for, an, elaborate, exterior, wren, s, inability, to, find, an, adequate, external, expression, for, a, building, which, was, wholly, conditioned, by, the, functionality, of, its, interior, space, and, his, refusal, to, bend, the, knee, to, classical, authority, in, the, way, that, our, experience, of, eighteenth, century, architecture, has, conditioned, us, to, believe, is, right, prior, to, the, theatre, s, 1669, completion, wren, had, received, further, commissions, for, the, garden, quadrangle, at, trinity, college, oxford, and, the, chapel, of, emmanuel, college, cambridge, wren, left, for, paris, in, july, 1665, on, his, first, and, only, trip, abroad, in, france, the, architect, encountered, an, architectural, milieu, more, closely, linked, to, the, ideals, of, the, italian, renaissance, wren, also, met, gian, lorenzo, bernini, who, was, widely, acknowledged, by, contemporaries, as, the, greatest, artist, of, the, century, though, bernini, s, concrete, influence, on, wren, s, designs, was, transmitted, via, published, plans, and, engravings, the, encounter, surely, impacted, the, budding, architect, and, his, vocational, trajectory, st, paul, s, cathedral, in, london, has, always, been, the, highlight, of, wren, s, reputation, his, association, with, it, spans, his, whole, architectural, career, including, the, 36, years, between, the, start, of, the, new, building, and, the, declaration, by, parliament, of, its, completion, in, 1711, letters, document, wren, s, involvement, in, st, paul, as, early, as, 1661, when, he, was, consulted, by, charles, ii, regarding, repairs, to, the, medieval, structure, in, the, spring, of, 1666, he, made, his, first, design, for, a, dome, for, st, paul, s, it, was, accepted, in, principle, on, 27, august, 1666, one, week, later, however, the, great, fire, of, london, reduced, two, thirds, of, the, city, to, a, smoking, desert, and, old, st, paul, s, to, ruin, wren, was, most, likely, at, oxford, at, the, time, but, the, news, so, fantastically, relevant, to, his, future, drew, him, at, once, to, london, between, 5, and, 11, september, he, ascertained, the, precise, area, of, devastation, worked, out, a, plan, for, rebuilding, the, city, and, submitted, it, to, charles, ii, others, also, submitted, plans, however, no, new, plan, proceeded, any, further, than, the, paper, on, which, it, was, drawn, a, rebuilding, of, london, act, which, provided, rebuilding, of, some, essential, buildings, was, passed, in, 1666, in, 1669, the, king, s, surveyor, of, works, died, and, wren, was, promptly, installed, it, was, not, until, 1670, that, the, pace, of, rebuilding, started, accelerating, a, second, rebuilding, act, was, passed, that, year, raising, the, tax, on, coal, and, thus, providing, a, source, of, funds, for, rebuilding, of, churches, destroyed, within, the, city, of, london, wren, presented, his, initial, first, model, for, st, paul, s, this, plan, was, accepted, and, demolition, of, the, old, cathedral, began, by, 1672, however, this, design, seemed, too, modest, and, wren, met, his, critics, by, producing, a, design, of, spectacular, grandeur, this, modified, design, called, great, model, was, accepted, by, the, king, and, the, construction, started, in, november, 1673, however, this, design, failed, to, satisfy, the, chapter, and, clerical, opinion, generally, moreover, it, had, an, economic, drawback, wren, was, confined, to, a, cathedral, form, desired, by, the, clergy, in, 1674, he, produced, the, rather, meagre, classical, gothic, compromise, known, as, the, warrant, design, however, this, design, called, so, from, the, royal, warrant, of, 14, may, 1675, attached, to, the, drawings, is, not, the, design, upon, which, work, had, begun, a, few, weeks, before, the, cathedral, that, wren, started, to, build, bears, only, a, slight, resemblance, to, the, warrant, design, in, 1697, the, first, service, was, held, in, the, cathedral, when, wren, was, 65, there, was, still, however, no, dome, finally, in, 1711, the, cathedral, was, declared, complete, and, wren, was, paid, the, half, of, his, salary, that, in, the, hope, of, accelerating, progress, parliament, had, withheld, for, 14, years, since, 1697, the, cathedral, had, been, built, for, 36, years, under, his, direction, and, the, only, disappointment, he, had, about, his, masterpiece, was, the, dome, against, his, wishes, the, commission, engaged, thornhill, to, paint, the, inner, dome, in, false, perspective, and, finally, authorised, a, balustrade, around, the, roof, line, this, diluted, the, hard, edge, wren, had, intended, for, his, cathedral, and, elicited, the, apt, parthian, comment, that, ladies, think, nothing, well, without, an, edging, during, the, 1670s, wren, received, significant, secular, commissions, among, many, of, his, notable, designs, at, this, time, the, monument, 1671, 76, commemorating, the, great, fire, also, involved, robert, hooke, but, wren, was, in, control, of, the, final, design, the, royal, observatory, 1675, 76, and, the, wren, library, at, trinity, college, cambridge, 1676, 84, were, the, most, important, ones, in, 1682, wren, advised, that, the, original, statues, of, the, king, s, beasts, on, st, george, s, chapel, windsor, be, removed, the, pinnacles, were, left, bare, until, 1925, when, replica, statues, were, installed, by, historical, accident, all, wren, s, large, scale, secular, commissions, dated, from, after, the, 1680s, at, the, age, of, 50, his, personal, development, as, was, that, of, english, architecture, was, ready, for, monumental, but, humane, architecture, in, which, the, scales, of, individual, parts, relate, both, to, the, whole, and, to, the, people, who, used, them, the, first, large, project, wren, designed, the, chelsea, hospital, 1682, 92, does, not, entirely, satisfy, the, eye, in, this, respect, but, met, its, brief, with, distinction, and, such, success, that, even, in, the, 21st, century, it, fulfils, its, original, function, the, reconstruction, of, the, stateroom, at, windsor, castle, was, notable, for, the, integration, of, architecture, sculpture, and, painting, this, commission, was, in, the, hand, of, hugh, may, who, died, in, february, 1684, before, the, construction, finished, wren, assumed, his, post, and, finalised, the, works, between, 1683, and, 1685, he, was, much, occupied, in, designing, the, king, s, house, winchester, where, charles, ii, had, hoped, to, spend, his, declining, years, but, which, was, never, completed, when, wren, promised, that, it, would, be, complete, within, a, year, the, king, who, was, conscious, of, his, mortality, replied, that, a, year, is, a, great, time, in, my, life, after, the, death, of, charles, ii, in, 1685, wren, s, attention, was, directed, mainly, to, whitehall, 1685, 87, the, new, king, james, ii, required, a, new, chapel, and, also, ordered, a, new, gallery, council, chamber, and, a, riverside, apartment, for, the, queen, later, when, james, ii, was, removed, from, the, throne, wren, took, on, architectural, projects, such, as, kensington, palace, 1689, 96, and, hampton, court, 1689, 1700, the, erection, of, the, present, windsor, guildhall, was, begun, in, 1687, under, the, direction, of, sir, thomas, fitz, or, fiddes, but, there, is, a, story, that, on, his, death, in, 1689, the, task, was, taken, over, by, sir, christopher, wren, it, was, completed, at, a, cost, of, 2687, 1s, 6d, the, new, building, was, supported, around, its, perimeter, by, stone, columns, providing, a, covered, area, beneath, as, a, venue, for, corn, markets, the, story, is, widely, told, that, the, borough, council, demanded, that, wren, should, insert, additional, columns, within, the, covered, area, in, order, to, support, the, weight, of, the, heavy, building, above, wren, however, was, adamant, that, these, were, not, necessary, eventually, the, council, insisted, and, in, due, course, the, extra, supporting, columns, were, built, but, wren, made, them, slightly, short, so, that, they, do, not, quite, touch, the, ceiling, hence, proving, his, claim, that, they, were, not, necessary, however, there, is, little, evidence, that, wren, was, ever, involved, in, the, design, or, construction, of, the, guildhall, it, is, now, believed, that, the, story, grew, out, of, wren, s, connections, with, windsor, and, that, his, son, also, called, christopher, wren, who, served, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, windsor, commissioned, the, statue, of, prince, george, of, denmark, in, 1713, on, the, south, end, of, the, building, and, his, name, was, engraved, underneath, the, pillars, were, probably, moved, into, the, corn, market, from, the, east, side, of, the, building, when, an, extension, was, added, in, 1829, the, gaps, at, the, top, of, the, pillars, are, now, filled, with, tiles, smaller, than, the, capitals, wren, did, not, pursue, his, work, on, architectural, design, as, actively, as, he, had, before, the, 1690s, although, he, still, played, important, roles, in, a, number, of, royal, commissions, in, 1696, he, was, appointed, surveyor, of, greenwich, naval, hospital, and, in, 1698, he, was, appointed, surveyor, of, westminster, abbey, he, resigned, from, the, former, role, in, 1716, but, held, the, latter, until, his, death, approving, with, a, wavering, signature, burlington, s, revisions, of, wren, s, own, earlier, designs, for, the, great, archway, of, westminster, school, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, the, lodge, of, antiquity, no, 2, one, of, the, four, founding, masonic, lodges, of, the, premier, grand, lodge, of, england, in, 1717, has, claimed, christopher, wren, to, have, been, its, master, at, the, goose, and, gridiron, at, st, paul, s, churchyard, whilst, he, was, rebuilding, the, cathedral, he, is, said, to, have, been, adopted, on, 18, may, 1691, that, is, accepted, as, a, sort, of, honorary, member, or, patron, rather, than, an, operative, their, 18th, century, maul, with, its, 1827, inscription, claiming, that, it, was, used, by, wren, for, the, foundation, stone, of, st, paul, s, belonging, to, the, lodge, and, on, display, in, the, library, and, museum, of, freemasonry, in, london, corroborates, the, story, james, anderson, made, the, claims, in, his, widely, circulated, constitutions, while, many, of, wren, s, friends, were, still, alive, but, he, made, many, highly, creative, claims, as, to, the, history, or, legends, of, freemasonry, there, is, also, a, clear, possibility, of, confusion, between, the, operative, workmen, s, lodges, which, might, naturally, have, welcomed, the, boss, and, the, speculative, or, gentlemen, s, lodges, which, became, highly, fashionable, just, after, wren, s, death, by, the, standards, of, his, time, a, gentleman, like, wren, would, not, generally, join, an, artisan, body, however, the, workmen, of, st, paul, s, cathedral, would, naturally, have, sought, the, patronage, or, interest, of, their, employer, and, within, wren, s, lifetime, there, was, a, predominantly, gentlemen, s, lodge, at, the, rummer, and, grapes, a, mile, upriver, at, westminster, where, wren, had, been, to, school, in, 1788, the, lodge, of, antiquity, thought, they, were, buying, a, portrait, of, wren, which, now, dominates, lodge, room, 10, in, the, same, building, as, the, museum, but, it, is, now, identified, with, william, talman, not, wren, nevertheless, this, recorded, event, and, many, old, records, attest, to, the, fact, that, antiquity, thought, that, wren, had, been, its, master, at, a, time, when, it, still, held, its, minute, books, for, the, relevant, years, which, were, lost, by, preston, at, some, date, after, 1778, the, evidence, of, whether, wren, was, a, speculative, freemason, is, the, subject, of, the, prestonian, lecture, of, 2011, which, concludes, on, the, evidence, of, two, obituaries, and, aubrey, s, memoirs, with, supporting, materials, that, he, did, indeed, attend, the, closed, meeting, in, 1691, probably, of, the, lodge, of, antiquity, but, that, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, that, he, was, ever, a, grand, officer, as, claimed, by, anderson, christopher, wren, appeared, on, the, reverse, of, the, first, british, 50, banknote, series, d, issued, in, modern, times, the, notes, were, printed, between, 1981, and, 1994, and, were, in, circulation, until, 1996, in, 1997, unesco, inscribed, wren, s, greenwich, hospital, on, the, world, heritage, list, citing, the, complex, s, outstanding, architectural, and, artistic, achievements, wren, appears, or, is, mentioned, in, several, restoration, era, novels, or, movies
