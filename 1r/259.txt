up, assets, we, have, helped, each, other, in, the, needs, and, jobs, we, have, had, however, they, also, had, a, natural, brother, francisco, who, hid, under, the, surname, of, gonz, lez, and, was, expelled, from, the, father, s, house, by, don, diego, although, he, left, written, in, 1615, that, he, be, recognized, as, legitimate, unless, he, had, married, with, that, woman, he, tried, to,

the, majority, of, which, were, secular, dramas, written, for, the, commercial, theatres, calder, n, served, in, the, spanish, royal, army, in, italy, and, flanders, between, 1625, and, 1635, by, the, time, lope, de, vega, died, in, 1635, calder, n, was, recognized, as, the, foremost, spanish, dramatist, of, the, age, calder, n, had, also, gained, considerable, favour, in, the, court, and, in,

newly, built, buen, retiro, palace, on, 28, may, 1640, he, joined, a, company, of, mounted, cuirassiers, recently, raised, by, gaspar, de, guzm, n, count, duke, of, olivares, took, part, in, the, catalan, campaign, and, distinguished, himself, by, his, gallantry, at, tarragona, his, health, failing, calder, n, retired, from, the, army, in, november, 1642, and, three, years, later, was, awarded, a, special, military, pension, in, recognition, of, his, services, in, the, field, calder, n, s, biography, during, the, next, few, years, is, obscure, his, brother, diego, calder, n, died, in, 1647, a, son, pedro, jos, was, born, to, calder, n, and, an, unknown, woman, between, 1647, and, 1649, the, mother, died, soon, after, calder, n, committed, his, son, to, the, care, of, his, nephew, jos, son, of, diego, perhaps, for, reasons, relating, to, these, personal, trials, calder, n, became, a, tertiary, of, the, order, of, st, francis, in, 1650, and, then, finally, joined, the, priesthood, he, was, ordained, in, 1651, and, served, as, a, parish, priest, at, san, salvador, church, in, madrid, which, was, later, demolished, as, part, of, the, 19th, century, spanish, confiscations, according, to, a, statement, calder, n, made, a, year, or, two, later, he, decided, to, give, up, writing, secular, drama, for, the, commercial, theatres, though, he, did, not, adhere, strictly, to, this, resolution, he, now, wrote, mostly, mythological, plays, for, the, palace, theatres, and, autos, sacramentales, one, act, allegories, illustrating, the, real, presence, in, the, eucharist, for, performance, during, the, feast, of, corpus, christi, in, 1662, two, of, calder, n, s, autos, las, rdenes, militares, and, m, stica, y, real, babilonia, were, the, subjects, of, an, investigation, by, the, spanish, inquisition, the, former, was, censored, its, manuscripts, confiscated, and, it, remained, banned, until, 1671, even, so, calder, n, was, appointed, honorary, chaplain, to, philip, iv, in, 1663, and, continued, as, chaplain, to, his, successor, in, his, eighty, first, year, he, wrote, his, last, secular, play, hado, y, divisa, de, leonido, y, marfisa, in, honor, of, charles, ii, s, marriage, to, maria, luisa, of, orl, ans, notwithstanding, his, position, at, court, and, his, popularity, throughout, spain, near, the, end, of, his, life, calder, n, struggled, with, financial, difficulties, but, with, the, motivation, of, the, carnival, of, 1680, he, wrote, his, last, work, of, comedy, hado, y, divisa, de, leonido, y, de, marfisa, he, died, on, 25, may, 1681, leaving, only, partially, complete, the, autos, sacramentales, that, he, had, been, working, on, for, that, year, his, burial, was, austere, and, unembellished, as, he, desired, in, his, will, uncovered, as, if, i, deserved, to, satisfy, in, part, the, public, vanities, of, my, poorly, spent, life, in, this, manner, he, left, the, theatres, orphaned, in, which, he, was, considered, one, of, the, best, dramatic, writers, of, his, time, calder, n, initiated, what, has, been, called, the, second, cycle, of, spanish, golden, age, theatre, whereas, his, predecessor, lope, de, vega, pioneered, the, dramatic, forms, and, genres, of, spanish, golden, age, theatre, calder, n, polished, and, perfected, them, whereas, lope, s, strength, lay, in, the, spontaneity, and, naturalness, of, his, work, calder, n, s, strength, lay, in, his, capacity, for, poetic, beauty, dramatic, structure, and, philosophical, and, theological, depth, calder, n, was, a, perfectionist, who, often, revisited, and, reworked, his, plays, even, long, after, they, were, first, performed, his, perfectionism, was, not, just, limited, to, his, own, work, several, of, his, plays, adapt, and, reimagine, existing, plays, or, scenes, by, other, dramatists, improving, their, depth, complexity, and, unity, calder, n, excelled, above, all, others, in, the, genre, of, the, auto, sacramental, in, which, he, showed, a, seemingly, inexhaustible, capacity, to, giving, new, dramatic, forms, to, a, given, set, of, theological, and, philosophical, constructs, calder, n, wrote, 120, comedias, 80, autos, sacramentales, and, 20, short, comedic, works, called, entremeses, as, goethe, notes, calder, n, tended, to, write, his, plays, by, taking, extra, special, care, of, their, dramatic, structure, he, therefore, usually, reduced, the, number, of, scenes, in, his, plays, as, compared, to, those, of, lope, de, vega, so, as, to, avoid, any, superfluidity, and, present, only, those, scenes, essential, to, the, play, also, reducing, the, number, of, different, metres, in, his, plays, for, the, sake, of, gaining, a, greater, stylistic, uniformity, calder, n, realized, that, any, play, was, a, work, of, fiction, and, that, the, structure, of, the, baroque, play, was, entirely, artificial, he, therefore, probably, influenced, by, cervantes, made, regular, use, of, metafictional, techniques, such, as, making, his, characters, joke, about, the, clich, s, they, are, expected, to, slavishly, follow, most, famously, in, his, masterpiece, la, vida, es, sue, o, calder, n, uses, an, astrological, prophecy, made, decades, before, the, beginning, of, the, play, as, a, way, to, deliberately, mislead, the, audience, about, how, the, plot, will, unfold, calder, n, intended, to, subtly, defend, the, catholic, doctrine, of, free, will, against, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, predestination, and, to, depict, the, unwritten, nature, of, each, individual, s, future, based, on, their, choices, although, his, poetry, and, plays, leaned, towards, culteranismo, calder, n, usually, reduced, the, level, and, obscurity, of, that, style, by, avoiding, metaphors, and, references, that, uneducated, viewers, would, not, understand, however, he, had, a, great, influence, anyway, in, later, centuries, upon, symbolism, for, example, by, making, a, fall, from, a, horse, a, metaphor, for, a, fall, into, disgrace, or, dishonour, some, of, the, most, common, themes, of, his, plays, were, heavily, influenced, by, his, classical, christian, education, by, the, jesuits, for, example, as, a, reader, and, great, admirer, of, scholastic, theologians, saint, thomas, aquinas, and, francisco, su, rez, calder, n, liked, to, confront, reason, against, emotion, intellect, against, instinct, love, against, vengeance, and, understanding, against, the, will, this, is, not, to, say, however, that, calder, n, has, never, had, his, critics, in, an, article, for, the, 1911, catholic, encyclopedia, harvard, university, professor, jeremiah, ford, wrote, were, one, to, contrast, shakespeare, with, lope, de, vega, he, would, discover, that, while, shakespeare, belongs, to, all, men, and, all, time, lope, is, the, particular, property, of, spain, and, is, bounded, by, national, limitations, the, character, of, calder, n, is, even, more, limited, still, he, is, not, only, spanish, rather, than, universal, but, as, a, spaniard, he, typifies, the, sentiments, and, ideals, of, a, narrowly, restricted, period, the, seventeenth, century, it, may, be, added, that, in, his, theatre, and, in, his, daily, life, he, was, a, model, of, the, truly, christian, and, knightly, poet, of, his, period, the, ideas, most, distinctive, of, his, age, which, we, see, reflected, in, calder, n, s, dramatic, works, are, intense, devotion, to, the, catholic, faith, absolute, and, unquestioning, loyalty, to, the, spanish, sovereign, and, a, highly, developed, even, much, exaggerated, feeling, of, honour, according, to, richard, e, chandler, and, kessel, schwartz, it, is, vital, to, realize, that, despite, the, end, of, the, reconquista, in, 1492, many, elements, of, islamic, spain, rooted, in, sharia, law, still, persisted, among, the, christian, population, during, the, lifetime, of, calder, n, one, must, understand, the, point, of, honor, pundonor, and, resulting, social, complications, to, understand, the, theatre, of, calder, n, or, in, fact, any, of, the, golden, age, dramatists, a, man, s, honor, was, a, touchy, point, based, primarily, upon, a, highly, refined, sentiment, of, conjugal, fidelity, but, extended, to, include, a, man, s, daughters, married, or, unmarried, or, any, other, woman, in, his, household, also, honor, had, to, be, kept, inviolate, an, extremely, difficult, thing, to, accomplish, and, if, sullied, had, to, be, avenged, arising, from, the, spaniard, s, sense, of, personal, dignity, and, his, desire, to, protect, his, reputation, it, became, a, matter, of, pride, and, self, respect, to, cleanse, tarnished, honor, which, even, gossip, could, blemish, all, male, members, of, the, household, were, responsible, for, protecting, the, family, s, name, and, no, honorable, gentleman, could, leave, family, honor, unavenged, in, relationships, between, the, sexes, the, code, of, honor, became, especially, sinister, and, led, to, the, most, barbarous, cruelties, a, husband, was, permitted, to, kill, his, wife, if, she, was, even, suspected, of, infidelity, and, her, lover, had, to, be, murdered, to, avoid, a, scandal, love, was, the, great, game, and, the, responsibilities, of, a, household, of, an, attractive, woman, was, a, terrible, burden, and, source, of, worry, for, the, husband, or, father, one, bloody, vengeance, called, for, another, and, bloody, feuds, raged, through, entire, families, the, ladies, especially, those, of, calder, n, and, tirso, were, highly, susceptible, to, risqu, situations, and, quite, unafraid, to, run, the, risk, of, a, compromising, and, dishonoring, one, calder, n, was, a, court, poet, and, was, consequently, versed, in, all, the, intricacies, of, the, honor, code, jeremiah, ford, continued, the, point, of, honour, often, carried, to, morbid, extremes, provides, the, motif, in, such, characteristic, pieces, as, the, alcade, de, zalamea, the, pintor, de, su, deshonra, the, m, dico, de, su, honra, and, a, secreto, agravio, secreta, venganza, the, actuating, principle, in, these, works, can, hardly, appeal, to, us, we, can, feel, little, sympathy, with, a, personage, who, methodically, and, in, cold, blood, slays, the, one, by, whom, his, honour, has, been, affronted, for, us, such, an, action, is, a, perversion, of, the, ideals, of, chivalry, in, contrast, alexander, a, parker, has, argued, in, an, article, of, his, own, for, encyclopedia, britannica, that, calder, n, was, actually, a, very, harsh, moral, critic, of, spanish, culture, at, the, time, in, which, he, lived, accepting, the, conventions, of, the, comedy, of, intrigue, a, favourite, form, on, the, spanish, stage, he, used, them, for, a, fundamentally, serious, purpose, la, dama, duende, 1629, the, phantom, lady, is, a, neat, and, lively, example, in, casa, con, dos, puertas, mala, es, de, guardar, 1629, a, house, with, two, doors, is, difficult, to, guard, the, intrigues, of, secret, courtship, and, the, disguises, that, it, necessitates, are, so, presented, that, the, traditional, seclusion, of, women, on, which, these, intrigues, are, based, is, shown, to, create, social, disorder, by, breeding, enmity, and, endangering, love, and, friendship, no, siempre, lo, peor, es, cierto, c, 1640, the, worst, is, not, always, true, and, no, hay, cosa, como, callar, 1639, silence, is, golden, mark, the, peak, of, this, development, although, the, conventions, of, comedy, remain, the, overtones, are, tragic, both, plays, also, implicitly, criticize, the, accepted, code, of, honour, calder, n, s, rejection, of, the, rigid, assumptions, of, the, code, of, honour, is, evident, also, in, his, tragedies, in, the, famous, el, alcalde, de, zalamea, the, secrecy, and, the, vengeance, demanded, by, the, code, are, rejected, this, play, also, presents, a, powerful, contrast, between, the, aristocracy, and, the, people, the, degeneration, of, the, aristocratic, ideal, is, exposed, wealth, is, associated, with, manual, labour, and, honour, is, shown, to, be, the, consequence, and, prerogative, of, moral, integrity, regardless, of, class, according, to, richard, e, chandler, and, kessel, schwartz, el, m, dico, de, su, honra, is, the, most, extreme, of, his, honor, tragedies, it, revolves, around, a, point, of, honor, and, recounts, how, a, husband, suspecting, his, wife, of, infidelity, causes, her, veins, to, be, opened, she, bleeds, to, death, washing, his, dishonor, away, with, her, blood, while, acknowledging, that, the, plot, of, the, same, play, has, caused, calder, n, s, humanity, to, be, questioned, alexander, a, parker, has, written, the, critics, who, allege, that, he, approves, of, the, murder, of, an, innocent, wife, because, honour, demands, it, overlook, the, fact, that, the, horror, one, feels, at, this, deed, is, precisely, what, he, intended, in, common, with, many, writers, from, the, spanish, golden, age, his, plays, usually, show, his, vital, pessimism, that, is, only, softened, by, his, rationalism, and, his, faith, in, the, christian, god, the, anguish, and, distress, usually, found, his, uvre, is, better, exemplified, in, one, of, his, most, famous, plays, la, vida, es, sue, o, life, is, a, dream, in, which, segismundo, claims, qu, es, la, vida, un, frenes, qu, es, la, vida, una, ilusi, n, una, sombra, una, ficci, n, y, el, mayor, bien, es, peque, o, que, toda, la, vida, es, sue, o, y, los, sue, os, sue, os, son, what, is, life, a, frenzy, what, is, life, an, illusion, a, shadow, a, fiction, and, the, greatest, good, is, small, for, all, of, life, is, a, dream, and, dreams, are, only, dreams, according, to, richard, e, chandler, and, kessel, schwartz, calder, n, s, cape, and, sword, plays, represent, the, perfection, of, a, type, introduced, by, lope, they, illustrate, the, type, carried, to, the, extreme, of, its, possibilities, with, unbelievably, complicated, plots, worked, out, with, mathematical, precision, lovers, intrigues, honor, complications, sudden, appearances, and, many, other, tricks, and, devices, are, resorted, to, by, the, playwright, to, complicate, and, then, to, disentangle, the, story, in, these, plays, as, well, as, in, the, honor, tragedies, calder, n, the, most, profoundly, spanish, poet, of, his, epoch, speaks, so, intimately, to, the, passions, and, ideals, of, the, time, that, he, often, lacks, the, little, universality, which, his, contemporaries, achieved, although, he, lacked, the, spontaneity, and, variety, of, the, phoenix, he, frequently, equaled, him, and, at, times, surpassed, him, in, sheer, beauty, of, poetry, with, rapturous, heights, which, even, lope, could, not, equal, he, was, more, profound, and, philosophical, than, lope, he, was, an, aristocratic, poet, and, unlike, lope, did, not, slavishly, cater, to, the, demands, of, the, public, lope, was, the, improviser, calder, n, was, the, planner, indeed, his, themes, tended, to, be, complex, and, philosophical, and, express, complicated, states, of, mind, in, a, manner, that, few, playwrights, have, been, able, to, manage, like, baltasar, graci, n, calder, n, favoured, only, the, deepest, human, feelings, and, moral, dilemmas, since, calder, n, s, plays, were, usually, produced, at, the, court, of, the, king, of, spain, he, had, access, to, the, most, modern, techniques, regarding, scenography, he, collaborated, with, cosme, lotti, in, developing, complex, scenographies, that, were, integrated, in, some, of, his, plays, specially, his, most, religious, themed, ones, such, as, the, autos, sacramentales, becoming, extremely, complex, allegories, of, moral, philosophical, and, religious, concepts, according, to, richard, e, chandler, and, kessel, schwartz, as, a, writer, of, autos, sacramentales, calder, n, is, supreme, the, auto, cultivated, since, the, time, of, gil, vicente, is, a, one, act, play, generally, allegorical, in, nature, which, at, one, time, or, another, treats, the, miracle, of, transubstantiation, autos, were, performed, in, spain, s, large, cities, during, the, corpus, christi, festival, in, the, open, air, on, temporary, stages, set, up, in, some, public, square, everyone, including, the, royalty, attended, the, public, performances, which, followed, the, processional, of, the, host, through, the, streets, to, the, church, some, believe, that, these, short, pieces, represent, the, best, of, the, calderonian, theatre, where, his, fertile, imagination, had, free, rein, and, his, sincere, religious, motives, and, faith, found, their, purest, expression, according, to, russian, symbolist, poet, and, dramatic, theorist, vyacheslav, ivanov, let, us, take, a, look, at, drama, which, in, modern, history, has, replaced, the, spectacles, of, universal, and, holy, events, as, reflected, in, miniature, and, purely, signifying, forms, on, the, stages, of, the, mystery, plays, we, know, that, classical, french, tragedy, is, one, of, triumphs, of, the, transformational, decisive, idealistic, principle, calder, n, however, is, different, in, him, everything, is, but, a, signification, of, the, objective, truth, of, divine, providence, which, governs, human, destiny, a, pious, son, of, the, spanish, church, he, was, able, to, combine, all, the, daring, of, naive, individualism, with, the, most, profound, realism, of, the, mystical, contemplation, of, divine, things, calder, n, s, fame, dwindled, during, the, 18th, century, due, to, the, anti, religious, currents, of, both, the, bourbon, reforms, and, the, enlightenment, in, spain, and, in, 1765, a, law, was, passed, forbidding, the, performance, of, autos, on, the, feast, of, corpus, christi, officially, for, being, sacrilegious, and, in, bad, taste, within, mere, decades, though, calder, n, was, rediscovered, in, the, germanosphere, by, highly, influential, jena, romantic, poet, and, indologist, august, wilhelm, schlegel, schlegel, s, literary, translations, and, high, critical, praise, rekindled, interest, in, calder, n, who, along, with, shakespeare, became, a, banner, figure, first, for, german, romanticism, and, then, for, romanticism, in, many, other, countries, and, languages, e, t, a, hoffmann, based, his, 1807, singspiel, liebe, und, eifersucht, on, a, stage, play, by, calder, n, la, banda, y, la, flor, the, scarf, and, the, flower, as, translated, by, schlegel, in, subsequent, decades, calder, n, was, repeatedly, translated, into, german, most, notably, by, johann, diederich, gries, and, joseph, von, eichendorff, and, had, an, enthusiastic, reception, on, the, german, and, austrian, stages, particularly, under, the, direction, of, goethe, and, joseph, schreyvogel, later, significant, german, language, adaptations, include, the, work, of, highly, influential, austrian, symbolist, poet, metafictional, playwright, and, richard, strauss, favorite, opera, librettist, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, who, made, literary, translations, of, la, vida, es, sue, o, and, el, gran, teatro, del, mundo, during, the, 19th, century, in, his, homeland, calder, n, de, la, barca, was, embraced, by, adherents, of, carlism, and, other, opponents, of, the, 1798, 1924, mass, confiscation, and, sale, of, church, property, by, the, state, the, expulsion, of, the, religious, orders, the, ban, on, classical, christian, education, and, the, many, other, anti, catholic, policies, of, liberal, spanish, monarchs, and, their, ministers, in, 1881, during, a, controversial, gathering, at, el, retiro, an, urban, park, on, the, site, of, the, demolished, royal, palace, where, many, of, his, plays, were, first, performed, on, the, two, hundredth, anniversary, of, calder, n, s, death, marcelino, men, ndez, pelayo, raised, a, toast, to, the, religious, values, of, calder, n, s, spain, and, the, supremacy, of, the, latino, race, over, germanic, barbarity, by, which, men, ndez, pelayo, meant, anti, catholic, spanish, krausist, and, the, hegelianist, intellectuals, f, lix, sard, y, salvany, the, author, of, the, book, liberalism, is, a, sin, and, his, fellow, integrists, and, carlists, considered, calder, n, de, la, barca, to, embody, the, most, brilliant, incarnation, of, the, spanish, catholic, literary, tradition, during, the, pre, 1917, silver, age, of, russian, poetry, highly, influential, russian, symbolist, poet, and, dramatic, theorist, vyacheslav, ivanov, who, was, heavily, influenced, by, german, romanticism, was, accordingly, an, enthusiast, for, calder, n, on, 19, april, 1910, vsevolod, meyerhold, even, staged, konstantin, balmont, s, literary, translation, of, calder, n, s, adoration, of, the, holy, cross, during, the, weekly, literary, salon, held, inside, ivanov, s, flat, overlooking, the, tauride, palace, in, st, petersburg, many, of, the, most, important, figures, in, russian, literature, at, the, time, were, either, present, or, acting, in, the, play, although, he, is, best, known, abroad, as, the, nobel, prize, winning, author, of, doctor, zhivago, soviet, dissident, intellectual, and, former, ivanov, protege, boris, pasternak, produced, acclaimed, russian, translations, of, calder, n, s, plays, during, the, late, 1950s, according, to, his, mistress, olga, ivinskaya, in, working, on, calder, n, he, received, help, from, nikolai, mikhailovich, liubumov, a, shrewd, and, enlightened, person, who, understood, very, well, that, all, the, mudslinging, and, commotion, over, the, novel, would, be, forgotten, but, that, there, would, always, be, a, pasternak, i, took, finished, bits, of, the, translation, with, me, to, moscow, read, them, to, liubimov, at, potapov, street, and, then, went, back, to, peredelkino, where, i, would, tactfully, ask, to, change, passages, which, in, liubimov, s, view, departed, too, far, from, the, original, very, soon, after, the, scandal, was, over, received, a, first, payment, for, the, work, on, calder, n, following, the, end, of, the, spanish, civil, war, calder, n, was, embraced, as, a, national, poet, by, the, francoist, government, this, however, has, not, harmed, his, popularity, in, spain, in, the, years, since, the, transition, back, to, constitutional, monarchy, the, persistent, influence, of, both, anti, catholicism, and, anti, spanish, sentiment, rooted, in, the, black, legend, still, means, that, even, the, existence, of, the, spanish, golden, age, let, alone, its, literary, artistic, and, cultural, achievements, remain, widely, unknown, in, the, english, speaking, world, both, this, ignorance, and, its, cultural, fallout, were, criticized, even, during, the, black, legend, s, elizabethan, era, inception, by, sir, philip, sidney, whose, 1580, essay, an, apology, for, poetry, expressed, very, high, praise, for, the, verse, dramas, he, had, attended, during, diplomatic, missions, in, france, spain, and, italy, playwrights, in, catholic, europe, during, the, counter, reformation, had, revived, aristotle, s, three, classical, unities, and, sidney, for, these, and, many, other, reasons, considered, them, vastly, superior, to, all, the, plays, then, being, written, and, performed, in, england, despite, this, calder, n, s, plays, were, first, translated, and, performed, in, english, during, his, lifetime, for, instance, the, diary, of, stuart, restoration, courtier, samuel, pepys, describes, attending, stage, plays, in, london, during, 1667, which, were, free, translations, from, calder, n, during, the, same, era, calder, n, s, many, emulators, in, writing, for, the, english, stage, included, poet, laureate, of, england, john, dryden, centuries, later, like, his, german, romantic, colleagues, english, romantic, poet, lord, byron, repeatedly, referenced, calder, n, whom, he, viewed, as, a, romantic, figure, byron, s, friend, and, fellow, romantic, poet, percy, bysshe, shelley, similarly, had, very, high, praise, in, his, essays, for, calder, n, and, personally, translated, a, substantial, portion, of, el, m, gico, prodigioso, despite, this, in, his, essay, a, defence, of, poetry, shelley, as, a, staunch, and, vocal, believer, in, atheism, feminism, and, the, rejection, of, christian, morality, also, expressed, very, harsh, criticism, for, calder, n, s, religious, beliefs, and, his, regular, decision, to, confront, the, human, mind, and, conscience, successfully, against, the, emotions, calder, n, in, his, religious, autos, has, attempted, to, fulfill, some, of, the, high, conditions, of, dramatic, presentation, neglected, by, shakespeare, such, as, establishing, a, relation, between, drama, and, religion, and, the, accommodating, them, to, music, and, dancing, but, he, admits, the, observation, of, conditions, still, more, important, and, more, is, lost, than, gained, by, the, substitution, of, the, rigidly, defined, and, ever, repeated, idealism, of, a, distorted, superstition, for, the, living, impersonations, of, the, truth, of, human, passion, later, in, the, same, essay, however, shelley, concluded, the, exertions, of, locke, hume, gibbon, voltaire, rousseau, and, their, disciples, in, favor, of, oppressed, and, deluded, humanity, are, entitled, to, the, gratitude, of, mankind, yet, it, is, easy, to, calculate, the, degree, of, moral, and, intellectual, improvement, which, the, world, would, have, exhibited, had, they, never, lived, a, little, more, nonsense, would, have, been, talked, for, a, century, or, two, and, perhaps, a, few, more, men, women, and, children, burnt, as, heretics, we, might, not, at, this, moment, have, been, congratulating, each, other, on, the, abolition, of, the, inquisition, in, spain, but, it, exceeds, all, imagination, to, conceive, what, would, have, been, the, moral, condition, of, the, world, if, neither, dante, petrarch, boccaccio, chaucer, shakespeare, calder, n, lord, bacon, nor, milton, had, ever, existed, if, raphael, and, michelangelo, had, never, been, born, if, the, hebrew, poetry, had, never, been, translated, if, a, revival, of, the, study, of, greek, literature, had, never, taken, place, if, no, monuments, of, ancient, sculpture, had, been, handed, down, to, us, and, if, the, poetry, of, the, religion, of, the, ancient, world, had, been, extinguished, together, with, its, belief, the, human, mind, could, never, except, by, the, intervention, of, these, excitements, have, been, awakened, to, the, invention, of, the, grosser, sciences, and, that, application, of, analytical, reasoning, to, the, aberrations, of, society, which, it, is, now, attempted, to, exalt, over, the, direct, expression, of, the, inventive, and, creative, faculty, itself, the, poetic, and, accurate, victorian, era, translations, of, irish, catholic, poet, denis, florence, maccarthy, were, commenced, because, maccarthy, was, a, great, admirer, of, shelley, and, therefore, took, the, latter, s, high, critical, praise, of, calder, n, in, multiple, essays, very, seriously, george, ticknor, declared, in, his, history, of, spanish, literature, that, maccarthy, has, succeeded, in, giving, a, faithful, idea, of, what, is, grandest, and, most, effective, in, genius, to, a, degree, which, i, had, previously, thought, impossible, nothing, i, think, in, the, english, language, will, give, us, so, true, an, impression, of, what, is, most, characteristic, of, the, spanish, drama, and, of, spanish, poetry, generally, so, highly, regarded, were, maccarthy, s, translations, that, in, 1881, he, was, awarded, a, medal, by, the, royal, spanish, academy, on, the, two, hundredth, anniversary, of, calder, n, s, death, other, translators, of, calder, n, s, works, into, english, have, included, edward, fitzgerald, roy, campbell, edwin, honig, kenneth, muir, ann, l, mackenzie, adrian, mitchell, and, gwynne, edwards, a, recent, revival, of, interest, in, calder, n, scholarship, can, be, attributed, to, british, reception, namely, through, the, works, of, a, a, parker, who, considered, la, hija, del, aire, to, be, his, finest, work, a, e, sloman, and, more, recently, bruce, wardropper, for, a, time, the, comedic, works, of, calder, n, were, underestimated, but, have, since, been, reevaluated, and, have, been, considered, as, masterfully, composed, works, as, being, classified, in, the, genre, of, comedias, de, enredo, such, as, his, works, la, dama, duende, the, phantom, lady, casa, con, dos, puertas, mala, es, de, guardar, a, house, with, two, doors, is, difficult, to, guard, or, el, gal, n, fantasma, the, heroic,
