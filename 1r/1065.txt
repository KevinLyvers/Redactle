form, of, mild, mockery, hadrian, s, first, official, post, in, rome, was, as, a, member, of, the, decemviri, stlitibus, judicandis, one, among, many, vigintivirate, offices, at, the, lowest, level, of, the, cursus, honorum, course, of, honours, that, could, lead, to, higher, office, and, a, senatorial, career, he, then, served, as, a, military, tribune, first, with, the, legio, ii, adiutrix, in, 95, then, with, the, legio, v, macedonica, during, hadrian, s, second, stint, as, tribune, the, frail, and, aged, reigning, emperor, nerva, adopted, trajan, as, his, heir, hadrian, was, dispatched, to, give, trajan, the, news, or, most, probably, was, one, of, many, emissaries, charged, with, this, same, commission, then, hadrian, was, transferred, to, legio, xxii, primigenia, and, a, third, tribunate, hadrian, s, three, tribunates, gave, him, some, career, advantage, most, scions, of, the, older, senatorial, families, might, serve, one, or, at, most, two, military, tribunates, as, a, prerequisite, to, higher, office, when, nerva, died, in, 98, hadrian, is, said, to, have, hastened, to, trajan, to, inform, him, ahead, of, the, official, envoy, sent, by, the, governor, hadrian, s, brother, in, law, and, rival, lucius, julius, ursus, servianus, in, 101, hadrian, was, back, in, rome, he, was, elected, quaestor, then, quaestor, imperatoris, traiani, liaison, officer, between, emperor, and, the, assembled, senate, to, whom, he, read, the, emperor, s, communiqu, s, and, speeches, which, he, possibly, composed, on, the, emperor, s, behalf, in, his, role, as, imperial, ghostwriter, hadrian, took, the, place, of, the, recently, deceased, licinius, sura, trajan, s, all, powerful, friend, and, kingmaker, his, next, post, was, as, ab, actis, senatus, keeping, the, senate, s, records, during, the, first, dacian, war, hadrian, took, the, field, as, a, member, of, trajan, s, personal, entourage, but, was, excused, from, his, military, post, to, take, office, in, rome, as, tribune, of, the, plebs, in, 105, after, the, war, he, was, probably, elected, praetor, during, the, second, dacian, war, hadrian, was, in, trajan, s, personal, service, again, he, was, released, to, serve, as, legate, of, legio, i, minervia, then, as, governor, of, lower, pannonia, in, 107, tasked, with, holding, back, the, sarmatians, between, 107, and, 108, hadrian, defeated, an, invasion, of, roman, controlled, banat, and, oltenia, by, the, iazyges, the, exact, terms, of, the, peace, treaty, are, not, known, it, is, believed, the, romans, kept, oltenia, in, exchange, for, some, form, of, concession, likely, involving, a, one, time, tribute, payment, the, iazyges, also, took, possession, of, banat, around, this, time, which, may, have, been, part, of, the, treaty, now, in, his, mid, thirties, hadrian, travelled, to, greece, he, was, granted, athenian, citizenship, and, was, appointed, eponymous, archon, of, athens, for, a, brief, time, in, 112, the, athenians, awarded, him, a, statue, with, an, inscription, in, the, theatre, of, dionysus, ig, ii2, 3286, offering, a, detailed, account, of, his, cursus, honorum, thus, far, thereafter, no, more, is, heard, of, him, until, trajan, s, parthian, campaign, it, is, possible, that, he, remained, in, greece, until, his, recall, to, the, imperial, retinue, when, he, joined, trajan, s, expedition, against, parthia, as, a, legate, when, the, governor, of, syria, was, sent, to, deal, with, renewed, troubles, in, dacia, hadrian, was, appointed, his, replacement, with, independent, command, trajan, became, seriously, ill, and, took, ship, for, rome, while, hadrian, remained, in, syria, de, facto, general, commander, of, the, eastern, roman, army, trajan, got, as, far, as, the, coastal, city, of, selinus, in, cilicia, and, died, there, on, 8, august, 117, he, would, be, regarded, as, one, of, rome, s, most, admired, popular, and, best, emperors, around, the, time, of, his, quaestorship, in, 100, or, 101, hadrian, had, married, trajan, s, seventeen, or, eighteen, year, old, grandniece, vibia, sabina, trajan, himself, seems, to, have, been, less, than, enthusiastic, about, the, marriage, and, with, good, reason, as, the, couple, s, relationship, would, prove, to, be, scandalously, poor, the, marriage, might, have, been, arranged, by, trajan, s, empress, plotina, this, highly, cultured, influential, woman, shared, many, of, hadrian, s, values, and, interests, including, the, idea, of, the, roman, empire, as, a, commonwealth, with, an, underlying, hellenic, culture, if, hadrian, were, to, be, appointed, trajan, s, successor, plotina, and, her, extended, family, could, retain, their, social, profile, and, political, influence, after, trajan, s, death, hadrian, could, also, count, on, the, support, of, his, mother, in, law, salonia, matidia, who, was, the, daughter, of, trajan, s, beloved, sister, ulpia, marciana, when, ulpia, marciana, died, in, 112, trajan, had, her, deified, and, made, salonia, matidia, an, augusta, hadrian, s, personal, relationship, with, trajan, was, complex, and, may, have, been, difficult, hadrian, seems, to, have, sought, influence, over, trajan, or, trajan, s, decisions, through, cultivation, of, the, latter, s, boy, favourites, this, gave, rise, to, some, unexplained, quarrel, around, the, time, of, hadrian, s, marriage, to, sabina, late, in, trajan, s, reign, hadrian, failed, to, achieve, a, senior, consulship, being, only, suffect, consul, for, 108, this, gave, him, parity, of, status, with, other, members, of, the, senatorial, nobility, but, no, particular, distinction, befitting, an, heir, designate, had, trajan, wished, it, he, could, have, promoted, his, protege, to, patrician, rank, and, its, privileges, which, included, opportunities, for, a, fast, track, to, consulship, without, prior, experience, as, tribune, he, chose, not, to, while, hadrian, seems, to, have, been, granted, the, office, of, tribune, of, the, plebs, a, year, or, so, younger, than, was, customary, he, had, to, leave, dacia, and, trajan, to, take, up, the, appointment, trajan, might, simply, have, wanted, him, out, of, the, way, the, historia, augusta, describes, trajan, s, gift, to, hadrian, of, a, diamond, ring, that, trajan, himself, had, received, from, nerva, which, encouraged, hopes, of, succeeding, to, the, throne, while, trajan, actively, promoted, hadrian, s, advancement, he, did, so, with, caution, failure, to, nominate, an, heir, could, invite, chaotic, destructive, wresting, of, power, by, a, succession, of, competing, claimants, a, civil, war, too, early, a, nomination, could, be, seen, as, an, abdication, and, reduce, the, chance, for, an, orderly, transmission, of, power, as, trajan, lay, dying, nursed, by, his, wife, plotina, and, closely, watched, by, prefect, attianus, he, could, have, lawfully, adopted, hadrian, as, heir, by, means, of, a, simple, deathbed, wish, expressed, before, witnesses, but, when, an, adoption, document, was, eventually, presented, it, was, signed, not, by, trajan, but, by, plotina, that, hadrian, was, still, in, syria, was, a, further, irregularity, as, roman, adoption, law, required, the, presence, of, both, parties, at, the, adoption, ceremony, rumours, doubts, and, speculation, attended, hadrian, s, adoption, and, succession, it, has, been, suggested, that, trajan, s, young, manservant, phaedimus, who, died, very, soon, after, trajan, was, killed, or, killed, himself, rather, than, face, awkward, questions, ancient, sources, are, divided, on, the, legitimacy, of, hadrian, s, adoption, cassius, dio, saw, it, as, bogus, and, the, historia, augusta, writer, as, genuine, an, aureus, minted, early, in, hadrian, s, reign, represents, the, official, position, it, presents, hadrian, as, trajan, s, caesar, trajan, s, heir, designate, according, to, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, informed, the, senate, of, his, accession, in, a, letter, as, a, fait, accompli, explaining, that, the, unseemly, haste, of, the, troops, in, acclaiming, him, emperor, was, due, to, the, belief, that, the, state, could, not, be, without, an, emperor, the, new, emperor, rewarded, the, legions, loyalty, with, the, customary, bonus, and, the, senate, endorsed, the, acclamation, various, public, ceremonies, were, organised, on, hadrian, s, behalf, celebrating, his, divine, election, by, all, the, gods, whose, community, now, included, trajan, deified, at, hadrian, s, request, hadrian, remained, in, the, east, for, a, while, suppressing, the, jewish, revolt, that, had, broken, out, under, trajan, he, relieved, judea, s, governor, the, outstanding, moorish, general, lusius, quietus, of, his, personal, guard, of, moorish, auxiliaries, then, he, moved, on, to, quell, disturbances, along, the, danube, frontier, in, rome, hadrian, s, former, guardian, and, current, praetorian, prefect, attianus, claimed, to, have, uncovered, a, conspiracy, involving, lusius, quietus, and, three, other, leading, senators, lucius, publilius, celsus, aulus, cornelius, palma, frontonianus, and, gaius, avidius, nigrinus, there, was, no, public, trial, for, the, four, they, were, tried, in, absentia, hunted, down, and, killed, hadrian, claimed, that, attianus, had, acted, on, his, own, initiative, and, rewarded, him, with, senatorial, status, and, consular, rank, then, pensioned, him, off, no, later, than, 120, hadrian, assured, the, senate, that, henceforth, their, ancient, right, to, prosecute, and, judge, their, own, would, be, respected, the, reasons, for, these, four, executions, remain, obscure, official, recognition, of, hadrian, as, a, legitimate, heir, may, have, come, too, late, to, dissuade, other, potential, claimants, hadrian, s, greatest, rivals, were, trajan, s, closest, friends, the, most, experienced, and, senior, members, of, the, imperial, council, any, of, them, might, have, been, a, legitimate, competitor, for, the, imperial, office, capaces, imperii, and, any, of, them, might, have, supported, trajan, s, expansionist, policies, which, hadrian, intended, to, change, one, of, their, number, was, aulus, cornelius, palma, who, as, a, former, conqueror, of, arabia, nabatea, would, have, retained, a, stake, in, the, east, the, historia, augusta, describes, palma, and, a, third, executed, senator, lucius, publilius, celsus, consul, for, the, second, time, in, 113, as, hadrian, s, personal, enemies, who, had, spoken, in, public, against, him, the, fourth, was, gaius, avidius, nigrinus, an, ex, consul, intellectual, friend, of, pliny, the, younger, and, briefly, governor, of, dacia, at, the, start, of, hadrian, s, reign, he, was, probably, hadrian, s, chief, rival, for, the, throne, a, senator, of, the, highest, rank, breeding, and, connections, according, to, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, had, considered, making, nigrinus, his, heir, apparent, before, deciding, to, get, rid, of, him, soon, after, in, 125, hadrian, appointed, quintus, marcius, turbo, as, his, praetorian, prefect, turbo, was, his, close, friend, a, leading, figure, of, the, equestrian, order, a, senior, court, judge, and, a, procurator, as, hadrian, also, forbade, equestrians, to, try, cases, against, senators, the, senate, retained, full, legal, authority, over, its, members, it, also, remained, the, highest, court, of, appeal, and, formal, appeals, to, the, emperor, regarding, its, decisions, were, forbidden, if, this, was, an, attempt, to, repair, the, damage, done, by, attianus, with, or, without, hadrian, s, full, knowledge, it, was, not, enough, hadrian, s, reputation, and, relationship, with, his, senate, were, irredeemably, soured, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, some, sources, describe, hadrian, s, occasional, recourse, to, a, network, of, informers, the, frumentarii, to, discreetly, investigate, persons, of, high, social, standing, including, senators, and, his, close, friends, hadrian, was, to, spend, more, than, half, his, reign, outside, italy, whereas, previous, emperors, had, for, the, most, part, relied, on, the, reports, of, their, imperial, representatives, around, the, empire, hadrian, wished, to, see, things, for, himself, previous, emperors, had, often, left, rome, for, long, periods, but, mostly, to, go, to, war, returning, once, the, conflict, was, settled, hadrian, s, near, incessant, travels, may, represent, a, calculated, break, with, traditions, and, attitudes, in, which, the, empire, was, a, purely, roman, hegemony, hadrian, sought, to, include, provincials, in, a, commonwealth, of, civilised, peoples, and, a, common, hellenic, culture, under, roman, supervision, he, supported, the, creation, of, provincial, towns, municipia, semi, autonomous, urban, communities, with, their, own, customs, and, laws, rather, than, the, imposition, of, new, roman, colonies, with, roman, constitutions, a, cosmopolitan, ecumenical, intent, is, evident, in, coin, issues, of, hadrian, s, later, reign, showing, the, emperor, raising, up, the, personifications, of, various, provinces, aelius, aristides, would, later, write, that, hadrian, extended, over, his, subjects, a, protecting, hand, raising, them, as, one, helps, fallen, men, on, their, feet, all, this, did, not, go, well, with, roman, traditionalists, the, self, indulgent, emperor, nero, had, enjoyed, a, prolonged, and, peaceful, tour, of, greece, and, had, been, criticised, by, the, roman, elite, for, abandoning, his, fundamental, responsibilities, as, emperor, in, the, eastern, provinces, and, to, some, extent, in, the, west, nero, had, enjoyed, popular, support, claims, of, his, imminent, return, or, rebirth, emerged, almost, immediately, after, his, death, hadrian, may, have, consciously, exploited, these, positive, popular, connections, during, his, own, travels, in, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, is, described, as, a, little, too, much, greek, too, cosmopolitan, for, a, roman, emperor, prior, to, hadrian, s, arrival, in, britannia, the, province, had, suffered, a, major, rebellion, from, 119, to, 121, inscriptions, tell, of, an, expeditio, britannica, that, involved, major, troop, movements, including, the, dispatch, of, a, detachment, vexillatio, comprising, some, 3, 000, soldiers, fronto, writes, about, military, losses, in, britannia, at, the, time, coin, legends, of, 119, 120, attest, that, quintus, pompeius, falco, was, sent, to, restore, order, in, 122, hadrian, initiated, the, construction, of, a, wall, to, separate, romans, from, barbarians, the, idea, that, the, wall, was, built, in, order, to, deal, with, an, actual, threat, or, its, resurgence, however, is, probable, but, nevertheless, conjectural, a, general, desire, to, cease, the, empire, s, extension, may, have, been, the, determining, motive, reduction, of, defence, costs, may, also, have, played, a, role, as, the, wall, deterred, attacks, on, roman, territory, at, a, lower, cost, than, a, massed, border, army, and, controlled, cross, border, trade, and, immigration, a, shrine, was, erected, in, york, to, britannia, as, the, divine, personification, of, britain, coins, were, struck, bearing, her, image, identified, as, britannia, by, the, end, of, 122, hadrian, had, concluded, his, visit, to, britannia, he, never, saw, the, finished, wall, that, bears, his, name, hadrian, appears, to, have, continued, through, southern, gaul, at, nemausus, he, may, have, overseen, the, building, of, a, basilica, dedicated, to, his, patroness, plotina, who, had, recently, died, in, rome, and, had, been, deified, at, hadrian, s, request, at, around, this, time, hadrian, dismissed, his, secretary, ab, epistulis, the, biographer, suetonius, for, excessive, familiarity, towards, the, empress, marcius, turbo, s, colleague, as, praetorian, prefect, gaius, septicius, clarus, was, dismissed, for, the, same, alleged, reason, perhaps, a, pretext, to, remove, him, from, office, hadrian, spent, the, winter, of, 122, 123, at, tarraco, in, spain, where, he, restored, the, temple, of, augustus, in, 123, hadrian, crossed, the, mediterranean, to, mauretania, where, he, personally, led, a, minor, campaign, against, local, rebels, the, visit, was, cut, short, by, reports, of, war, preparations, by, parthia, hadrian, quickly, headed, eastwards, at, some, point, he, visited, cyrene, where, he, personally, funded, the, training, of, young, men, from, well, bred, families, for, the, roman, military, cyrene, had, benefited, earlier, in, hadrian, s, reign, in, 119, from, his, restoration, of, public, buildings, destroyed, during, the, earlier, trajanic, jewish, revolt, birley, describes, this, kind, of, investment, as, characteristic, of, hadrian, when, hadrian, arrived, on, the, euphrates, he, personally, negotiated, a, settlement, with, the, parthian, king, osroes, i, inspected, the, roman, defences, then, set, off, westwards, along, the, black, sea, coast, he, probably, wintered, in, nicomedia, the, main, city, of, bithynia, nicomedia, had, been, hit, by, an, earthquake, only, shortly, before, his, stay, hadrian, provided, funds, for, its, rebuilding, and, was, acclaimed, as, restorer, of, the, province, it, is, possible, that, hadrian, visited, claudiopolis, and, saw, the, beautiful, antinous, a, young, man, of, humble, birth, who, became, hadrian, s, lover, literary, and, epigraphic, sources, say, nothing, of, when, or, where, they, met, depictions, of, antinous, show, him, aged, 20, or, so, shortly, before, his, death, in, 130, in, 123, he, would, most, likely, have, been, a, youth, of, 13, or, 14, it, is, also, possible, that, antinous, was, sent, to, rome, to, be, trained, as, a, page, to, serve, the, emperor, and, only, gradually, rose, to, the, status, of, imperial, favourite, the, actual, historical, detail, of, their, relationship, is, mostly, unknown, with, or, without, antinous, hadrian, travelled, through, anatolia, various, traditions, suggest, his, presence, at, particular, locations, and, allege, his, foundation, of, a, city, within, mysia, hadrianutherae, after, a, successful, boar, hunt, at, about, this, time, plans, to, complete, the, temple, of, zeus, in, cyzicus, begun, by, the, kings, of, pergamon, were, put, into, practice, the, temple, received, a, colossal, statue, of, hadrian, cyzicus, pergamon, smyrna, ephesus, and, sardes, were, promoted, as, regional, centres, for, the, imperial, cult, neocoros, hadrian, arrived, in, greece, during, the, autumn, of, 124, and, participated, in, the, eleusinian, mysteries, he, had, a, particular, commitment, to, athens, which, had, previously, granted, him, citizenship, and, an, archonate, at, the, athenians, request, he, revised, their, constitution, among, other, things, he, added, a, new, phyle, tribe, which, was, named, after, him, hadrian, combined, active, hands, on, interventions, with, cautious, restraint, he, refused, to, intervene, in, a, local, dispute, between, producers, of, olive, oil, and, the, athenian, assembly, and, council, who, had, imposed, production, quotas, on, oil, producers, yet, he, granted, an, imperial, subsidy, for, the, athenian, grain, supply, hadrian, created, two, foundations, to, fund, athens, public, games, festivals, and,

several, were, given, to, argos, to, remedy, a, water, shortage, so, severe, and, so, long, standing, that, thirsty, argos, featured, in, homeric, epic, during, that, winter, hadrian, toured, the, peloponnese, his, exact, route, is, uncertain, but, it, took, in, epidaurus, pausanias, describes, temples, built, there, by, hadrian, and, his, statue, in, heroic, nudity, erected, by, its, citizens, in, thanks, to, their, restorer, antinous, and, hadrian, may, have, already, been, lovers, at, this, time, hadrian, showed, particular, generosity, to, mantinea, which, shared, ancient, mythic, politically, useful, links, with, antinous, home, at, bithynia, he, restored, mantinea, s, temple, of, poseidon, hippios, and, according, to, pausanias, restored, the, city, s, original, classical, name, it, had, been, renamed, antigoneia, since, hellenistic, times, after, the, macedonian, king, antigonus, iii, doson, hadrian, also, rebuilt, the, ancient, shrines, of, abae, and, megara, and, the, heraion, of, argos, during, his, tour, of, the, peloponnese, hadrian, persuaded, the, spartan, grandee, eurycles, herculanus, leader, of, the, euryclid, family, that, had, ruled, sparta, since, augustus, day, to, enter, the, senate, alongside, the, athenian, grandee, herodes, atticus, the, elder, the, two, aristocrats, would, be, the, first, from, old, greece, to, enter, the, roman, senate, as, representatives, of, sparta, and, athens, traditional, rivals, and, great, powers, of, the, classical, age, this, was, an, important, step, in, overcoming, greek, notables, reluctance, to, take, part, in, roman, political, life, in, march, 125, hadrian, presided, at, the, athenian, festival, of, dionysia, wearing, athenian, dress, the, temple, of, olympian, zeus, had, been, under, construction, for, more, than, five, centuries, hadrian, committed, the, vast, resources, at, his, command, to, ensure, that, the, job, would, be, finished, on, his, return, to, italy, hadrian, made, a, detour, to, sicily, coins, celebrate, him, as, the, restorer, of, the, island, back, in, rome, he, saw, the, rebuilt, pantheon, and, his, completed, villa, at, nearby, tibur, among, the, sabine, hills, in, early, march, 127, hadrian, set, off, on, a, tour, of, italy, his, route, has, been, reconstructed, through, the, evidence, of, his, gifts, and, donations, he, restored, the, shrine, of, cupra, in, cupra, maritima, and, improved, the, drainage, of, the, fucine, lake, less, welcome, than, such, largesse, was, his, decision, in, 127, to, divide, italy, into, four, regions, under, imperial, legates, with, consular, rank, acting, as, governors, they, were, given, jurisdiction, over, all, of, italy, excluding, rome, itself, therefore, shifting, italian, cases, from, the, courts, of, rome, having, italy, effectively, reduced, to, the, status, of, a, group, of, mere, provinces, did, not, go, down, well, with, the, roman, senate, and, the, innovation, did, not, long, outlive, hadrian, s, reign, hadrian, fell, ill, around, this, time, whatever, the, nature, of, his, illness, it, did, not, stop, him, from, setting, off, in, the, spring, of, 128, to, visit, africa, his, arrival, coincided, with, the, good, omen, of, rain, which, ended, a, drought, along, with, his, usual, role, as, benefactor, and, restorer, he, found, time, to, inspect, the, troops, his, speech, to, them, survives, hadrian, returned, to, italy, in, the, summer, of, 128, but, his, stay, was, brief, as, he, set, off, on, another, tour, that, would, last, three, years, in, september, 128, hadrian, attended, the, eleusinian, mysteries, again, this, time, his, visit, to, greece, seems, to, have, concentrated, on, athens, and, sparta, the, two, ancient, rivals, for, dominance, of, greece, hadrian, had, played, with, the, idea, of, focusing, his, greek, revival, around, the, amphictyonic, league, based, in, delphi, but, by, now, he, had, decided, on, something, far, grander, his, new, panhellenion, was, going, to, be, a, council, that, would, bring, greek, cities, together, having, set, in, motion, the, preparations, deciding, whose, claim, to, be, a, greek, city, was, genuine, would, take, time, hadrian, set, off, for, ephesus, from, greece, hadrian, proceeded, by, way, of, asia, to, egypt, probably, conveyed, across, the, aegean, with, his, entourage, by, an, ephesian, merchant, lucius, erastus, hadrian, later, sent, a, letter, to, the, council, of, ephesus, supporting, erastus, as, a, worthy, candidate, for, town, councillor, and, offering, to, pay, the, requisite, fee, hadrian, arrived, in, egypt, before, the, egyptian, new, year, on, 29, august, 130, he, opened, his, stay, in, egypt, by, restoring, pompey, the, great, s, tomb, at, pelusium, offering, sacrifice, to, him, as, a, hero, and, composing, an, epigraph, for, the, tomb, as, pompey, was, universally, acknowledged, as, responsible, for, establishing, rome, s, power, in, the, east, this, restoration, was, probably, linked, to, a, need, to, reaffirm, roman, eastern, hegemony, following, social, unrest, there, during, trajan, s, late, reign, hadrian, and, antinous, held, a, lion, hunt, in, the, libyan, desert, a, poem, on, the, subject, by, the, greek, pankrates, is, the, earliest, evidence, that, they, travelled, together, while, hadrian, and, his, entourage, were, sailing, on, the, nile, antinous, drowned, the, exact, circumstances, surrounding, his, death, are, unknown, and, accident, suicide, murder, and, religious, sacrifice, have, all, been, postulated, historia, augusta, offers, the, following, account, during, a, journey, on, the, nile, he, lost, antinous, his, favourite, and, for, this, youth, he, wept, like, a, woman, concerning, this, incident, there, are, varying, rumours, for, some, claim, that, he, had, devoted, himself, to, death, for, hadrian, and, others, what, both, his, beauty, and, hadrian, s, sensuality, suggest, but, however, this, may, be, the, greeks, deified, him, at, hadrian, s, request, and, declared, that, oracles, were, given, through, his, agency, but, these, it, is, commonly, asserted, were, composed, by, hadrian, himself, hadrian, founded, the, city, of, antino, polis, in, antinous, honour, on, 30, october, 130, he, then, continued, down, the, nile, to, thebes, where, his, visit, to, the, colossi, of, memnon, on, 20, and, 21, november, was, commemorated, by, four, epigrams, inscribed, by, julia, balbilla, after, that, he, headed, north, reaching, the, fayyum, at, the, beginning, of, december, hadrian, s, movements, after, his, journey, down, the, nile, are, uncertain, whether, or, not, he, returned, to, rome, he, travelled, in, the, east, during, 130, 131, to, organise, and, inaugurate, his, new, panhellenion, which, was, to, be, focused, on, the, athenian, temple, to, olympian, zeus, as, local, conflicts, had, led, to, the, failure, of, the, previous, scheme, for, a, hellenic, association, centered, on, delphi, hadrian, decided, instead, for, a, grand, league, of, all, greek, cities, successful, applications, for, membership, involved, mythologised, or, fabricated, claims, to, greek, origins, and, affirmations, of, loyalty, to, imperial, rome, to, satisfy, hadrian, s, personal, idealised, notions, of, hellenism, hadrian, saw, himself, as, protector, of, greek, culture, and, the, liberties, of, greece, in, this, case, urban, self, government, it, allowed, hadrian, to, appear, as, the, fictive, heir, to, pericles, who, supposedly, had, convened, a, previous, panhellenic, congress, such, a, congress, is, mentioned, only, in, pericles, biography, by, plutarch, who, respected, rome, s, imperial, order, epigraphical, evidence, suggests, that, the, prospect, of, applying, to, the, panhellenion, held, little, attraction, to, the, wealthier, hellenised, cities, of, asia, minor, which, were, jealous, of, athenian, and, european, greek, preeminence, within, hadrian, s, scheme, hadrian, s, notion, of, hellenism, was, narrow, and, deliberately, archaising, he, defined, greekness, in, terms, of, classical, roots, rather, than, a, broader, hellenistic, culture, some, cities, with, a, dubious, claim, to, greekness, however, such, as, side, were, acknowledged, as, fully, hellenic, the, german, sociologist, georg, simmel, remarked, that, the, panhellenion, was, based, on, games, commemorations, preservation, of, an, ideal, an, entirely, non, political, hellenism, hadrian, bestowed, honorific, titles, on, many, regional, centres, palmyra, received, a, state, visit, and, was, given, the, civic, name, hadriana, palmyra, hadrian, also, bestowed, honours, on, various, palmyrene, magnates, among, them, one, soados, who, had, done, much, to, protect, palmyrene, trade, between, the, roman, empire, and, parthia, hadrian, had, spent, the, winter, of, 131, 32, in, athens, where, he, dedicated, the, now, completed, temple, of, olympian, zeus, at, some, time, in, 132, he, headed, east, to, judaea, in, roman, judaea, hadrian, visited, jerusalem, which, was, still, in, ruins, after, the, first, roman, jewish, war, of, 66, 73, he, may, have, planned, to, rebuild, jerusalem, as, a, roman, colony, as, vespasian, had, done, with, caesarea, maritima, with, various, honorific, and, fiscal, privileges, the, non, roman, population, would, have, no, obligation, to, participate, in, roman, religious, rituals, but, were, expected, to, support, the, roman, imperial, order, this, is, attested, in, caesarea, where, some, jews, served, in, the, roman, army, during, both, the, 66, and, 132, rebellions, it, has, been, speculated, that, hadrian, intended, to, assimilate, the, jewish, temple, to, the, traditional, roman, civic, religious, imperial, cult, such, assimilations, had, long, been, commonplace, practice, in, greece, and, in, other, provinces, and, on, the, whole, had, been, successful, the, neighbouring, samaritans, had, already, integrated, their, religious, rites, with, hellenistic, ones, strict, jewish, monotheism, proved, more, resistant, to, imperial, cajoling, and, then, to, imperial, demands, a, tradition, based, on, the, historia, augusta, suggests, that, the, revolt, was, spurred, by, hadrian, s, abolition, of, circumcision, brit, milah, which, as, a, hellenist, he, viewed, as, mutilation, the, scholar, peter, sch, fer, maintains, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, claim, given, the, notoriously, problematical, nature, of, the, historia, augusta, as, a, source, the, tomfoolery, shown, by, the, writer, in, the, relevant, passage, and, the, fact, that, contemporary, roman, legislation, on, genital, mutilation, seems, to, address, the, general, issue, of, castration, of, slaves, by, their, masters, other, issues, could, have, contributed, to, the, outbreak, a, heavy, handed, culturally, insensitive, roman, administration, tensions, between, the, landless, poor, and, incoming, roman, colonists, privileged, with, land, grants, and, a, strong, undercurrent, of, messianism, predicated, on, jeremiah, s, prophecy, that, the, temple, would, be, rebuilt, seventy, years, after, its, destruction, as, the, first, temple, had, been, after, the, babylonian, exile, a, massive, anti, hellenistic, and, anti, roman, jewish, uprising, broke, out, led, by, simon, bar, kokhba, given, the, fragmentary, nature, of, the, existing, evidence, it, is, impossible, to, ascertain, an, exact, date, for, the, beginning, of, the, uprising, it, probably, began, between, summer, and, fall, of, 132, the, roman, governor, tineius, tynius, rufus, asked, for, an, army, to, crush, the, resistance, bar, kokhba, punished, any, jew, who, refused, to, join, his, ranks, according, to, justin, martyr, and, eusebius, that, had, to, do, mostly, with, christian, converts, who, opposed, bar, kokhba, s, messianic, claims, the, romans, were, overwhelmed, by, the, organised, ferocity, of, the, uprising, hadrian, called, his, general, sextus, julius, severus, from, britain, and, brought, troops, in, from, as, far, as, the, danube, roman, losses, were, heavy, an, entire, legion, or, its, numeric, equivalent, of, around, 4, 000, hadrian, s, report, on, the, war, to, the, roman, senate, omitted, the, customary, salutation, if, you, and, your, children, are, in, health, it, is, well, i, and, the, legions, are,

the, extent, of, punitive, measures, against, the, jewish, population, remains, a, matter, of, debate, hadrian, replaced, the, province, s, name, by, renaming, it, syria, palaestina, he, renamed, jerusalem, aelia, capitolina, after, himself, and, jupiter, capitolinus, and, had, it, rebuilt, in, greek, style, according, to, epiphanius, hadrian, appointed, aquila, from, sinope, in, pontus, as, overseer, of, the, work, of, building, the, city, since, he, was, related, to, him, by, marriage, hadrian, is, said, to, have, placed, the, city, s, main, forum, at, the, junction, of, the, main, cardo, and, decumanus, maximus, now, the, location, for, the, smaller, muristan, after, the, suppression, of, the, jewish, revolt, hadrian, provided, the, samaritans, with, a, temple, dedicated, to, zeus, hypsistos, highest, zeus, on, mount, gerizim, the, bloody, repression, of, the, revolt, ended, jewish, political, independence, from, the, roman, imperial, order, inscriptions, make, it, clear, that, in, 133, hadrian, took, to, the, field, with, his, armies, against, the, rebels, he, then, returned, to, rome, probably, in, that, year, and, almost, certainly, judging, from, inscriptions, via, illyricum, hadrian, spent, the, final, years, of, his, life, in, rome, in, 134, he, took, an, imperial, salutation, for, the, end, of, the, third, jewish, war, which, was, not, actually, concluded, until, the, following, year, commemorations, and, achievement, awards, were, kept, to, a, minimum, as, hadrian, came, to, see, the, war, as, a, cruel, and, sudden, disappointment, to, his, aspirations, towards, a, cosmopolitan, empire, empress, sabina, died, probably, in, 136, after, an, unhappy, marriage, with, which, hadrian, had, coped, as, a, political, necessity, the, historia, augusta, biography, states, that, hadrian, himself, declared, that, his, wife, s, ill, temper, and, irritability, would, be, reason, enough, for, a, divorce, were, he, a, private, citizen, that, gave, credence, after, sabina, s, death, to, the, common, belief, that, hadrian, had, her, poisoned, in, keeping, with, well, established, imperial, propriety, sabina, who, had, been, made, an, augusta, sometime, around, 128, was, deified, not, long, after, her, death, hadrian, s, marriage, to, sabina, had, been, childless, suffering, from, poor, health, hadrian, turned, to, the, issue, of, succession, in, 136, he, adopted, one, of, the, ordinary, consuls, of, that, year, lucius, ceionius, commodus, who, as, an, emperor, in, waiting, took, the, name, lucius, aelius, caesar, he, was, the, son, in, law, of, gaius, avidius, nigrinus, one, of, the, four, consulars, executed, in, 118, his, health, was, delicate, and, his, reputation, apparently, more, that, of, a, voluptuous, well, educated, great, lord, than, that, of, a, leader, various, modern, attempts, have, been, made, to, explain, hadrian, s, choice, jerome, carcopino, proposes, that, aelius, was, hadrian, s, natural, son, it, has, also, been, speculated, that, his, adoption, was, hadrian, s, belated, attempt, to, reconcile, with, one, of, the, most, important, of, the, four, senatorial, families, whose, leading, members, had, been, executed, soon, after, hadrian, s, succession, aelius, acquitted, himself, honourably, as, joint, governor, of, pannonia, superior, and, pannonia, inferior, he, held, a, further, consulship, in, 137, but, died, on, 1, january, 138, hadrian, next, adopted, titus, aurelius, fulvus, boionius, arrius, antoninus, the, future, emperor, antoninus, pius, who, had, served, hadrian, as, one, of, the, five, imperial, legates, of, italy, and, as, proconsul, of, asia, in, the, interests, of, dynastic, stability, hadrian, required, that, antoninus, adopt, both, lucius, ceionius, commodus, son, of, the, deceased, aelius, caesar, and, marcus, annius, verus, grandson, of, an, influential, senator, of, the, same, name, who, had, been, hadrian, s, close, friend, annius, was, already, betrothed, to, aelius, caesar, s, daughter, ceionia, fabia, it, may, not, have, been, hadrian, but, rather, antoninus, pius, annius, verus, s, uncle, who, supported, annius, verus, advancement, the, latter, s, divorce, of, ceionia, fabia, and, subsequent, marriage, to, antoninus, daughter, annia, faustina, points, in, the, same, direction, when, he, eventually, became, emperor,

and, unhappiness, his, adoption, of, aelius, caesar, proved, unpopular, not, least, with, hadrian, s, brother, in, law, lucius, julius, ursus, servianus, and, servianus, s, grandson, gnaeus, pedanius, fuscus, salinator, servianus, though, now, far, too, old, had, stood, in, the, line, of, succession, at, the, beginning, of, hadrian, s, reign, fuscus, is, said, to, have, had, designs, on, the, imperial, power, for, himself, in, 137, he, may, have, attempted, a, coup, in, which, his, grandfather, was, implicated, hadrian, ordered, that, both, be, put, to, death, servianus, is, reported, to, have, prayed, before, his, execution, that, hadrian, would, long, for, death, but, be, unable, to, die, during, his, final, protracted, illness, hadrian, was, prevented, from, suicide, on, several, occasions, hadrian, died, in, the, year, 138, on, 10, july, in, his, villa, at, baiae, at, the, age, of, 62, having, reigned, for, 21, years, dio, cassius, and, the, historia, augusta, record, details, of, his, failing, health, some, modern, sources, interpret, the, ear, creases, on, later, portrayals, such, as, the, townley, hadrian, as, signs, of, coronary, artery, disease, he, was, buried, at, puteoli, near, baiae, on, an, estate, that, had, once, belonged, to, cicero, soon, after, his, remains, were, transferred, to, rome, and, buried, in, the, gardens, of, domitia, close, to, the, almost, complete, mausoleum, upon, completion, of, the, mausoleum, of, hadrian, in, rome, in, 139, by, his, successor, antoninus, pius, his, body, was, cremated, his, ashes, were, placed, there, together, with, those, of, his, wife, vibia, sabina, and, his, first, adopted, son, lucius, aelius, caesar, who, also, died, in, 138, the, senate, had, been, reluctant, to, grant, hadrian, divine, honours, but, antoninus, persuaded, them, by, threatening, to, refuse, the, position, of, emperor, hadrian, was, given, a, temple, on, the, campus, martius, ornamented, with, reliefs, representing, the, provinces, the, senate, awarded, antoninus, the, title, of, pius, in, recognition, of, his, filial, piety, in, pressing, for, the, deification, of, hadrian, his, adoptive, father, at, the, same, time, perhaps, in, reflection, of, the, senate, s, ill, will, towards, hadrian, commemorative, coinage, honouring, his, deification, was, kept, to, a, minimum, most, of, hadrian, s, military, activities, were, consistent, with, his, ideology, of, empire, as, a, community, of, mutual, interest, and, support, he, focused, on, protection, from, external, and, internal, threats, on, raising, existing, provinces, rather, than, the, aggressive, acquisition, of, wealth, and, territory, through, subjugation, of, foreign, peoples, that, had, characterised, the, early, empire, hadrian, s, policy, shift, was, part, of, a, trend, towards, the, slowing, down, of, the, empire, s, expansion, such, expansion, being, not, closed, after, him, the, empire, s, greatest, extent, being, achieved, only, during, the, severan, dynasty, but, a, significant, step, in, that, direction, given, the, empire, s, overstretching, while, the, empire, as, a, whole, benefited, from, this, military, careerists, resented, the, loss, of, opportunities, the, 4th, century, historian, aurelius, victor, saw, hadrian, s, withdrawal, from, trajan, s, territorial, gains, in, mesopotamia, as, a, jealous, belittlement, of, trajan, s, achievements, traiani, gloriae, invidens, more, likely, an, expansionist, policy, was, no, longer, sustainable, the, empire, had, lost, two, legions, the, legio, xxii, deiotariana, and, the, lost, legion, ix, hispania, possibly, destroyed, in, a, late, trajanic, uprising, by, the, brigantes, in, britain, trajan, himself, may, have, thought, his, gains, in, mesopotamia, indefensible, and, abandoned, them, shortly, before, his, death, hadrian, granted, parts, of, dacia, to, the, roxolani, sarmatians, their, king, rasparaganus, received, roman, citizenship, client, king, status, and, possibly, an, increased, subsidy, hadrian, s, presence, on, the, dacian, front, is, mere, conjecture, but, dacia, was, included, in, his, coin, series, with, allegories, of, the, provinces, a, controlled, partial, withdrawal, of, troops, from, the, dacian, plains, would, have, been, less, costly, than, maintaining, several, roman, cavalry, units, and, a, supporting, network, of, fortifications, hadrian, retained, control, over, osroene, through, the, client, king, parthamaspates, who, had, once, served, as, trajan, s, client, king, of, parthia, and, around, 123, hadrian, negotiated, a, peace, treaty, with, the, now, independent, parthia, according, to, the, historia, augusta, disputed, late, in, his, reign, 135, the, alani, attacked, roman, cappadocia, with, the, covert, support, of, pharasmanes, the, king, of, caucasian, iberia, the, attack, was, repulsed, by, hadrian, s, governor, the, historian, arrian, who, subsequently, installed, a, roman, adviser, in, iberia, arrian, kept, hadrian, well, informed, on, matters, related, to, the, black, sea, and, the, caucasus, between, 131, and, 132, he, sent, hadrian, a, lengthy, letter, periplus, of, the, euxine, on, a, maritime, trip, around, the, black, sea, that, was, intended, to, offer, relevant, information, in, case, a, roman, intervention, was, needed, hadrian, also, developed, permanent, fortifications, and, military, posts, along, the, empire, s, borders, limites, sl, limes, to, support, his, policy, of, stability, peace, and, preparedness, that, helped, keep,

ones, hadrian, s, policy, was, peace, through, strength, even, threat, with, an, emphasis, on, disciplina, discipline, which, was, the, subject, of, two, monetary, series, cassius, dio, praised, hadrian, s, emphasis, on, spit, and, polish, as, cause, for, the, generally, peaceful, character, of, his, reign, fronto, by, contrast, claimed, that, hadrian, preferred, war, games, to, actual, war, and, enjoyed, giving, eloquent, speeches, to, the, armies, like, the, inscribed, series, of, addresses, he, made, while, on, an, inspection, tour, during, 128, at, the, new, headquarters, of, legio,

decurions, the, usually, middle, class, elected, local, officials, responsible, for, running, the, ordinary, everyday, official, business, of, the, provinces, counted, as, honestiores, so, did,

counted, as, humiliores, with, low, citizen, status, high, tax, obligations, and, limited, rights, like, most, romans, hadrian, seems, to, have, accepted, slavery, as, morally, correct, an, expression, of, the, same, natural, order, that, rewarded, the, best, men, with, wealth, power, and, respect, when, confronted, by, a, crowd, demanding, the, freeing, of, a, popular, slave, charioteer, hadrian, replied, that, he, could, not, free, a, slave, belonging, to, another, person, however, he, limited, the, punishments, that, slaves, could, suffer, they, could, be, lawfully,

or, to, a, procurer, except, as, legally, justified, punishment, hadrian, also, forbade, torture, of, free, defendants, and, witnesses, he, abolished, ergastula, private, prisons, for, slaves, in, which, kidnapped, free, men, had, sometimes, been, illegally, detained, hadrian, issued, a, general, rescript, imposing, a, ban, on, castration, performed, on, freedman, or, slave, voluntarily, or,

line, with, contemporary, antiquarian, tastes, during, hadrian, s, third, and, last, trip, to, the, greek, east, there, seems, to, have, been, an, upwelling, of, religious, fervour, focused, on,

of, prusa, had, equated, the, growth, of, the, beard, with, the, hellenic, ethos, hadrian, s, beard, may, also, have, served, to, conceal, his, natural, facial, blemishes, before, him, all, emperors,

skilled, astrologer, hadrian, wrote, poetry, in, both, latin, and, greek, one, of, the, few, surviving, examples, is, a, latin, poem, he, reportedly, composed, on, his, deathbed, see, below, some, of, his, greek, productions, found, their, way, into, the, palatine, anthology, he, also, wrote, an, autobiography, which, historia, augusta, says, was, published, under, the, name, of, hadrian, s, freedman, phlegon, of, tralles, it, was, not, a, work, of, great, length, or, revelation, but, designed, to, scotch, various, rumours, or, explain, hadrian, s, most, controversial, actions, it, is, possible, that, this, autobiography, had, the, form, of, a, series, of, open, letters, to, antoninus, pius, according, to, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, composed, the, following, poem, shortly, before, his, death, the, poem, has, enjoyed, remarkable, popularity, but, uneven, critical, acclaim, according, to, aelius, spartianus, the, alleged, author, of, hadrian, s, biography, in, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, wrote, also, similar, poems, in, greek, not, much, better, than, this, one, t, s, eliot, s, poem, animula, may, have, been, inspired, by, hadrian, s, though, the, relationship, is, not, unambiguous, hadrian, has, been, described, as, the, most, versatile, of, all, roman, emperors, who, adroitly, concealed, a, mind, envious, melancholy, hedonistic, and, excessive, with, respect, to, his, own, ostentation, he, simulated, restraint, affability, clemency, and, conversely, disguised, the, ardor, for, fame, with, which, he, burned, his, successor, marcus, aurelius, in, his, meditations, lists, those, to, whom, he, owes, a, debt, of, gratitude, hadrian, is, conspicuously, absent, hadrian, s, tense, authoritarian, relationship, with, his, senate, was, acknowledged, a, generation, after, his, death, by, fronto, himself, a, senator, who, wrote, in, one, of, his, letters, to, marcus, aurelius, that, i, praised, the, deified, hadrian, your, grandfather, in, the, senate, on, a, number, of, occasions, with, great, enthusiasm, and, i, did, this, willingly, too, but, if, it, can, be, said, respectfully, acknowledging, your, devotion, towards, your, grandfather, i, wanted, to, appease, and, assuage, hadrian, as, i, would, mars, gradivus, or, dis, pater, rather, than, to, love, him, fronto, adds, in, another, letter, that, he, kept, some, friendships, during, hadrian, s, reign, under, the, risk, of, my, life, cum, periculo, capitis, hadrian, underscored, the, autocratic, character, of, his, reign, by, counting, his, dies, imperii, from, the, day, of, his, acclamation, by, the, armies, rather, than, the, senate, and, legislating, by, frequent, use, of, imperial, decrees, to, bypass, the, need, for, the, senate, s, approval, the, veiled, antagonism, between, hadrian, and, the, senate, never, grew, to, overt, confrontation, as, had, happened, during, the, reigns, of, overtly, bad, emperors, because, hadrian, knew, how, to, remain, aloof, and, avoid, an, open, clash, that, hadrian, spent, half, of, his, reign, away, from, rome, in, constant, travel, probably, helped, to, mitigate, the, worst, of, this, permanently, strained, relationship, in, 1503, niccol, machiavelli, though, an, avowed, republican, esteemed, hadrian, as, an, ideal, princeps, one, of, rome, s, five, good, emperors, friedrich, schiller, called, hadrian, the, empire, s, first, servant, edward, gibbon, admired, his, vast, and, active, genius, and, his, equity, and, moderation, and, considered, hadrian, s, era, as, part, of, the, happiest, era, of, human, history, in, ronald, syme, s, view, hadrian, was, a, f, hrer, a, duce, a, caudillo, according, to, syme, tacitus, description, of, the, rise, and, accession, of, tiberius, is, a, disguised, account, of, hadrian, s, authoritarian, principate, according, again, to, syme, tacitus, annals, would, be, a, work, of, contemporary, history, written, during, hadrian, s, reign, and, hating, it, while, the, balance, of, ancient, literary, opinion, almost, invariably, compares, hadrian, unfavourably, to, his, predecessor, modern, historians, have, sought, to, examine, his, motives, purposes, and, the, consequences, of, his, actions, and, policies, for, m, a, levi, a, summing, up, of, hadrian, s, policies, should, stress, the, ecumenical, character, of, the, empire, his, development, of, an, alternate, bureaucracy, disconnected, from, the, senate, and, adapted, to, the, needs, of, an, enlightened, autocracy, and, his, overall, defensive, strategy, this, would, qualify, him, as, a, grand, roman, political, reformer, creator, of, an, openly, absolute, monarchy, to, replace, a, sham, senatorial, republic, robin, lane, fox, credits, hadrian, as, creator, of, a, unified, greco, roman, cultural, tradition, and, as, the, end, of, this, same, tradition, hadrian, s, attempted, restoration, of, classical, culture, within, a, non, democratic, empire, drained, it, of, substantive, meaning, or, in, fox, s, words, kill, it, with, kindness, hadrian, s, portraiture, shows, him, as, the, first, roman, emperor, with, a, beard, most, emperors, after, him, followed, his, lead, 10, different, portrait, types, are, known, of, hadrian, a, juvenile, type, with, curly, hair, broad, side, burns, and, a, light, moustache, but, a, free, chin, was, shown, on, coins, later, in, his, life, on, rare, aurei, but, likely, reflects, an, early, portrait, before, he, became, emperor, his, first, portrait, type, as, caesar, and, augustus, used, on, coins, in, mid, 117ad, shows, again, broad, sideburns, merging, into, a, strong, moustache, and, still, a, free, chin, the, beard, thus, resembles, beard, styles, popular, in, the, 19th, century, like, emperor, franz, josef, of, austria, this, is, then, followed, by, portraits, showing, hadrian, with, a, short, well, groomed, full, beard, until, his, death, of, note, his, portraits, do, not, age, during, his, reign, see, other, portrait, images, of, hadrian, in, this, article, for, examples, of, the, later, hadrian, portraits, in, hadrian, s, time, there, was, already, a, well, established, convention, that, one, could, not, write, a, contemporary, roman, imperial, history, for, fear, of, contradicting, what, the, emperors, wanted, to, say, read, or, hear, about, themselves, as, an, earlier, latin,

xiphilinius, who, focused, on, hadrian, s, religious, interests, the, bar, kokhba, war, and, little, else, mostly, on, hadrian, s, moral, qualities, and, his, fraught, relationship, with, the, senate, there, are, various, other, sources, referred, to, by, later, commentators, such, as, the, encomium, of, aspasius, of, byblos, that, are, now, completely, lost, the, principal, source, for, hadrian,

notorious, for, its, unreliability, a, mish, mash, of, actual, fact, cloak, and, dagger, sword, and, sandal, with, a, sprinkling, of, ubu, roi, but, most, modern, historians, consider, its, account, of, hadrian, to, be, relatively, free, of, outright, fictions, and, probably, based, on, sound, historical, sources, principally, one, of, a, lost, series, of, imperial, biographies, by, the,
