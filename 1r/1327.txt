believed, that, in, signing, the, accords, sadat, had, put, egypt, s, interests, ahead, of, arab, unity, betraying, nasser, s, pan, arabism, and, destroyed, the, vision, of, a, united, arab, front, for, the, support, of, the, palestinians, against, the, zionist, entity, however, sadat, decided, early, on, that, peace, was, the, solution, sadat, s, shift, towards, a, strategic, relationship,

camp, david, accords, soon, gave, the, country, resilient, economic, growth, by, 1980, however, egypt, s, strained, relations, with, the, arab, world, would, result, in, a, period, of, rapid, inflation, the, relationship, between, iran, and, egypt, had, fallen, into, open, hostility, during, gamal, abdel, nasser, s, presidency, following, his, death, in, 1970, president, sadat, turned,
