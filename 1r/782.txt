speak, of, what, i, thought, or, felt, i, used, to, reflect, how, wonderful, it, would, have, been, to, know, shelley, and, to, wonder, whether, i, should, meet, any, live, human, being, with, whom, i, should, feel, so, much, sympathy, russell, claimed, that, beginning, at, age, 15, he, spent, considerable, time, thinking, about, the, validity, of, christian, religious, dogma, which, he, found,

mathematics, a, work, on, foundations, of, mathematics, it, advanced, a, thesis, of, logicism, that, mathematics, and, logic, are, one, and, the, same, at, the, age, of, 29, in, february, 1901, russell, underwent, what, he, called, a, sort, of, mystic, illumination, after, witnessing, whitehead, s, wife, s, suffering, in, an, angina, attack, i, found, myself, filled, with, semi, mystical, feelings, about, beauty, and, with, a, desire, almost, as, profound, as, that, of, the, buddha, to, find, some, philosophy, which, should, make, human, life, endurable, russell, would, later, recall, at, the, end, of, those, five, minutes, i, had, become, a, completely, different, person, in, 1905, he, wrote, the, essay, on, denoting, which, was, published, in, the, philosophical, journal, mind, russell, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1908, the, three, volume, principia, mathematica, written, with, whitehead, was, published, between, 1910, and, 1913, this, along, with, the, earlier, the, principles, of, mathematics, soon, made, russell, world, famous, in, his, field, russell, s, first, political, activity, was, as, the, independent, liberal, candidate, in, the, 1907, by, election, for, the, wimbledon, constituency, where, he, was, not, elected, in, 1910, he, became, a, lecturer, at, the, university, of, cambridge, trinity, college, where, he, had, studied, he, was, considered, for, a, fellowship, which, would, give, him, a, vote, in, the, college, government, and, protect, him, from, being, fired, for, his, opinions, but, was, passed, over, because, he, was, anti, clerical, because, he, was, agnostic, he, was, approached, by, the, austrian, engineering, student, ludwig, wittgenstein, who, became, his, phd, student, russell, viewed, wittgenstein, as, a, successor, who, would, continue, his, work, on, logic, he, spent, hours, dealing, with, wittgenstein, s, various, phobias, and, his, bouts, of, despair, this, was, a, drain, on, russell, s, energy, but, russell, continued, to, be, fascinated, by, him, and, encouraged, his, academic, development, including, the, publication, of, wittgenstein, s, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, in, 1922, russell, delivered, his, lectures, on, logical, atomism, his, version, of, these, ideas, in, 1918, before, the, end, of, world, war, i, wittgenstein, was, at, that, time, serving, in, the, austrian, army, and, subsequently, spent, nine, months, in, an, italian, prisoner, of, war, camp, at, the, end, of, the, conflict, during, world, war, i, russell, was, one, of, the, few, people, to, engage, in, active, pacifist, activities, in, 1916, because, of, his, lack, of, a, fellowship, he, was, dismissed, from, trinity, college, following, his, conviction, under, the, defence, of, the, realm, act, 1914, he, later, described, this, in, free, thought, and, official, propaganda, as, an, illegitimate, means, the, state, used, to, violate, freedom, of, expression, russell, championed, the, case, of, eric, chappelow, a, poet, jailed, and, abused, as, a, conscientious, objector, russell, played, a, part, in, the, leeds, convention, in, june, 1917, a, historic, event, which, saw, well, over, a, thousand, anti, war, socialists, gather, many, being, delegates, from, the, independent, labour, party, and, the, socialist, party, united, in, their, pacifist, beliefs, and, advocating, a, peace, settlement, the, international, press, reported, that, russell, appeared, with, a, number, of, labour, members, of, parliament, mps, including, ramsay, macdonald, and, philip, snowden, as, well, as, former, liberal, mp, and, anti, conscription, campaigner, professor, arnold, lupton, after, the, event, russell, told, lady, ottoline, morrell, that, to, my, surprise, when, i, got, up, to, speak, i, was, given, the, greatest, ovation, that, was, possible, to, give, anybody, his, conviction, in, 1916, resulted, in, russell, being, fined, 100, equivalent, to, 7, 100, in, 2023, which, he, refused, to, pay, in, hope, that, he, would, be, sent, to, prison, but, his, books, were, sold, at, auction, to, raise, the, money, the, books, were, bought, by, friends, he, later, treasured, his, copy, of, the, king, james, bible, that, was, stamped, confiscated, by, cambridge, police, a, later, conviction, for, publicly, lecturing, against, inviting, the, united, states, to, enter, the, war, on, the, united, kingdom, s, side, resulted, in, six, months, imprisonment, in, brixton, prison, see, bertrand, russell, s, political, views, in, 1918, he, was, prosecuted, under, the, defence, of, the, realm, act, he, later, said, of, his, imprisonment, i, found, prison, in, many, ways, quite, agreeable, i, had, no, engagements, no, difficult, decisions, to, make, no, fear, of, callers, no, interruptions, to, my, work, i, read, enormously, i, wrote, a, book, introduction, to, mathematical, philosophy, and, began, the, work, for, the, analysis, of, mind, i, was, rather, interested, in, my, fellow, prisoners, who, seemed, to, me, in, no, way, morally, inferior, to, the, rest, of, the, population, though, they, were, on, the, whole, slightly, below, the, usual, level, of, intelligence, as, was, shown, by, their, having, been, caught, while, he, was, reading, strachey, s, eminent, victorians, chapter, about, gordon, he, laughed, out, loud, in, his, cell, prompting, the, warder, to, intervene, and, reminding, him, that, prison, was, a, place, of, punishment, russell, was, reinstated, to, trinity, in, 1919, resigned, in, 1920, was, tarner, lecturer, in, 1926, and, became, a, fellow, again, in, 1944, until, 1949, in, 1924, russell, again, gained, press, attention, when, attending, a, banquet, in, the, house, of, commons, with, well, known, campaigners, including, arnold, lupton, who, had, been, an, mp, and, had, also, endured, imprisonment, for, passive, resistance, to, military, or, naval, service, in, 1941, g, h, hardy, wrote, a, 61, page, pamphlet, titled, bertrand, russell, and, trinity, published, later, as, a, book, by, cambridge, university, press, with, a, foreword, by, c, d, broad, in, which, he, gave, an, authoritative, account, of, russell, s, 1916, dismissal, from, trinity, college, explaining, that, a, reconciliation, between, the, college, and, russell, had, later, taken, place, and, gave, details, about, russell, s, personal, life, hardy, writes, that, russell, s, dismissal, had, created, a, scandal, since, the, vast, majority, of, the, fellows, of, the, college, opposed, the, decision, the, ensuing, pressure, from, the, fellows, induced, the, council, to, reinstate, russell, in, january, 1920, it, was, announced, that, russell, had, accepted, the, reinstatement, offer, from, trinity, and, would, begin, lecturing, from, october, in, july, 1920, russell, applied, for, a, one, year, leave, of, absence, this, was, approved, he, spent, the, year, giving, lectures, in, china, and, japan, in, january, 1921, it, was, announced, by, trinity, that, russell, had, resigned, and, his, resignation, had, been, accepted, this, resignation, hardy, explains, was, voluntary, and, was, not, the, result, of, another, altercation, the, reason, for, the, resignation, according, to, hardy, was, that, russell, was, going, through, a, tumultuous, time, in, his, personal, life, with, a, divorce, and, subsequent, remarriage, russell, contemplated, asking, trinity, for, another, one, year, leave, of, absence, but, decided, against, it, since, this, would, have, been, an, unusual, application, and, the, situation, had, the, potential, to, snowball, into, another, controversy, although, russell, did, the, right, thing, in, hardy, s, opinion, the, reputation, of, the, college, suffered, with, russell, s, resignation, since, the, world, of, learning, knew, about, russell, s, altercation, with, trinity, but, not, that, the, rift, had, healed, in, 1925, russell, was, asked, by, the, council, of, trinity, college, to, give, the, tarner, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, the, sciences, these, would, later, be, the, basis, for, one, of, russell, s, best, received, books, according, to, hardy, the, analysis, of, matter, published, in, 1927, in, the, preface, to, the, trinity, pamphlet, hardy, wrote, i, wish, to, make, it, plain, that, russell, himself, is, not, responsible, directly, or, indirectly, for, the, writing, of, the, pamphlet, i, wrote, it, without, his, knowledge, and, when, i, sent, him, the, typescript, and, asked, for, his, permission, to, print, it, i, suggested, that, unless, it, contained, misstatement, of, fact, he, should, make, no, comment, on, it, he, agreed, to, this, no, word, has, been, changed, as, the, result, of, any, suggestion, from, him, in, august, 1920, russell, travelled, to, soviet, russia, as, part, of, an, official, delegation, sent, by, the, british, government, to, investigate, the, effects, of, the, russian, revolution, he, wrote, a, four, part, series, of, articles, titled, soviet, russia, 1920, for, the, magazine, the, nation, he, met, vladimir, lenin, and, had, an, hour, long, conversation, with, him, in, his, autobiography, he, mentions, that, he, found, lenin, disappointing, sensing, an, impish, cruelty, in, him, and, comparing, him, to, an, opinionated, professor, he, cruised, down, the, volga, on, a, steamship, his, experiences, destroyed, his, previous, tentative, support, for, the, revolution, he, subsequently, wrote, a, book, the, practice, and, theory, of, bolshevism, about, his, experiences, on, this, trip, taken, with, a, group, of, 24, others, from, the, uk, all, of, whom, came, home, thinking, well, of, the, soviet, regime, despite, russell, s, attempts, to, change, their, minds, for, example, he, told, them, that, he, had, heard, shots, fired, in, the, middle, of, the, night, and, was, sure, that, these, were, clandestine, executions, but, the, others, maintained, that, it, was, only, cars, backfiring, russell, s, lover, dora, black, a, british, author, feminist, and, socialist, campaigner, visited, soviet, russia, independently, at, the, same, time, in, contrast, to, his, reaction, she, was, enthusiastic, about, the, bolshevik, revolution, the, following, year, russell, accompanied, by, dora, visited, peking, as, beijing, was, then, known, outside, of, china, to, lecture, on, philosophy, for, a, year, he, went, with, optimism, and, hope, seeing, china, as, then, being, on, a, new, path, other, scholars, present, in, china, at, the, time, included, john, dewey, and, rabindranath, tagore, the, indian, nobel, laureate, poet, before, leaving, china, russell, became, gravely, ill, with, pneumonia, and, incorrect, reports, of, his, death, were, published, in, the, japanese, press, when, the, couple, visited, japan, on, their, return, journey, dora, took, on, the, role, of, spurning, the, local, press, by, handing, out, notices, reading, mr, bertrand, russell, having, died, according, to, the, japanese, press, is, unable, to, give, interviews, to, japanese, journalists, apparently, they, found, this, harsh, and, reacted, resentfully, russell, supported, his, family, during, this, time, by, writing, popular, books, explaining, matters, of, physics, ethics, and, education, to, the, layman, from, 1922, to, 1927, the, russells, divided, their, time, between, london, and, cornwall, spending, summers, in, porthcurno, in, the, 1922, and, 1923, general, elections, russell, stood, as, a, labour, party, candidate, in, the, chelsea, constituency, but, only, on, the, basis, that, he, knew, he, was, unlikely, to, be, elected, in, such, a, safe, conservative, seat, and, he, was, unsuccessful, on, both, occasions, after, the, birth, of, his, two, children, he, became, interested, in, education, especially, early, childhood, education, he, was, not, satisfied, with, the, old, traditional, education, and, thought, that, progressive, education, also, had, some, flaws, as, a, result, together, with, dora, russell, founded, the, experimental, beacon, hill, school, in, 1927, the, school, was, run, from, a, succession, of, different, locations, including, its, original, premises, at, the, russells, residence, telegraph, house, near, harting, west, sussex, during, this, time, he, published, on, education, especially, in, early, childhood, on, 8, july, 1930, dora, gave, birth, to, her, third, child, harriet, ruth, after, he, left, the, school, in, 1932, dora, continued, it, until, 1943, in, 1927, russell, met, barry, fox, later, barry, stevens, who, became, a, known, gestalt, therapist, and, writer, in, later, years, they, developed, an, intense, relationship, and, in, fox, s, words, for, three, years, we, were, very, close, fox, sent, her, daughter, judith, to, beacon, hill, school, from, 1927, to, 1932, russell, wrote, 34, letters, to, fox, upon, the, death, of, his, elder, brother, frank, in, 1931, russell, became, the, 3rd, earl, russell, russell, s, marriage, to, dora, grew, tenuous, and, it, reached, a, breaking, point, over, her, having, two, children, with, an, american,

letter, if, the, germans, succeed, in, sending, an, invading, army, to, england, we, should, do, best, to, treat, them, as, visitors, give, them, quarters, and, invite, the, commander, and, chief, to, dine, with, the, prime, minister, in, 1940, he, changed, his, appeasement, view, that, avoiding, a, full, scale, world, war, was, more, important, than, defeating, hitler, he, concluded, that, adolf, hitler, taking, over, all, of, europe, would, be, a, permanent, threat, to, democracy, in, 1943, he, adopted, a, stance, toward, large, scale, warfare, called, relative, political, pacifism, war, was,

eccentric, albert, c, barnes, soon, soured, and, he, returned, to, the, uk, in, 1944, to, rejoin, the, faculty, of, trinity, college, russell, participated, in, many, broadcasts, over, the, bbc, particularly, the, brains, trust, and, for, the, third, programme, on, various, topical, and, philosophical, subjects, by, this, time, russell, was, known, outside, academic, circles, frequently, the, subject, or, author, of, magazine, and, newspaper, articles, and, was, called, upon, to, offer, opinions, on, a, variety, of, subjects, even, mundane, ones, en, route, to, one, of, his, lectures, in, trondheim, russell, was, one, of, 24, survivors, out, of, 43, passengers, of, an, aeroplane, crash, in, hommelvik, in, october, 1948, he, said, he, owed, his, life, to, smoking, since, the, people, who, drowned, were, in, the, non, smoking, part, of, the, plane, a, history, of, western, philosophy, 1945, became, a, best, seller, and, provided, russell, with, a, steady, income, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, 1942, russell, argued, in, favour, of, a, moderate, socialism, capable, of, overcoming, its, metaphysical, principles, in, an, inquiry, on, dialectical, materialism, launched, by, the, austrian, artist, and, philosopher, wolfgang, paalen, in, his, journal, dyn, russell, said, i, think, the, metaphysics, of, both, hegel, and, marx, plain, nonsense, marx, s, claim, to, be, science, is, no, more, justified, than, mary, baker, eddy, s, this, does, not, mean, that, i, am, opposed, to, socialism, in, 1943, russell, expressed, support, for, zionism, i, have, come, gradually, to, see, that, in, a, dangerous, and, largely, hostile, world, it, is, essential, to, jews, to, have, some, country, which, is, theirs, some, region, where, they, are, not, suspected, aliens, some, state, which, embodies, what, is, distinctive, in, their, culture, in, a, speech, in, 1948, russell, said, that, if, the, ussr, s, aggression, continued, it, would, be, morally, worse, to, go, to, war, after, the, ussr, possessed, an, atomic, bomb, than, before, it, possessed, one, because, if, the, ussr, had, no, bomb, the, west, s, victory, would, come, more, swiftly, and, with, fewer, casualties, than, if, there, were, atomic, bombs, on, both, sides, at, that, time, only, the, united, states, possessed, an, atomic, bomb, and, the, ussr, was, pursuing, an, aggressive, policy, towards, the, countries, in, eastern, europe, which, were, being, absorbed, into, the, soviet, union, s, sphere, of, influence, many, understood, russell, s, comments, to, mean, that, russell, approved, of, a, first, strike, in, a, war, with, the, ussr, including, nigel, lawson, who, was, present, when, russell, spoke, of, such, matters, others, including, griffin, who, obtained, a, transcript, of, the, speech, have, argued, that, he, was, explaining, the, usefulness, of, america, s, atomic, arsenal, in, deterring, the, ussr, from, continuing, its, domination, of, eastern, europe, just, after, the, atomic, bombs, exploded, over, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, russell, wrote, letters, and, published, articles, in, newspapers, from, 1945, to, 1948, stating, clearly, that, it, was, morally, justified, and, better, to, go, to, war, against, the, ussr, using, atomic, bombs, while, the, united, states, possessed, them, and, before, the, ussr, did, in, september, 1949, one, week, after, the, ussr, tested, its, first, a, bomb, but, before, this, became, known, russell, wrote, that, the, ussr, would, be, unable, to, develop, nuclear, weapons, because, following, stalin, s, purges, only, science, based, on, marxist, principles, would, be, practised, in, the, soviet, union, after, it, became, known, that, the, ussr, had, carried, out, its, nuclear, bomb, tests, russell, declared, his, position, advocating, the, total, abolition, of, atomic, weapons, in, 1948, russell, was, invited, by, the, bbc, to, deliver, the, inaugural, reith, lectures, what, was, to, become, an, annual, series, of, lectures, still, broadcast, by, the, bbc, his, series, of, six, broadcasts, titled, authority, and, the, individual, explored, themes, such, as, the, role, of, individual, initiative, in, the, development, of, a, community, and, the, role, of, state, control, in, a, progressive, society, russell, continued, to, write, about, philosophy, he, wrote, a, foreword, to, words, and, things, by, ernest, gellner, which, was, highly, critical, of, the, later, thought, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, and, of, ordinary, language, philosophy, gilbert, ryle, refused, to, have, the, book, reviewed, in, the, philosophical, journal, mind, which, caused, russell, to, respond, via, the, times, the, result, was, a, month, long, correspondence, in, the, times, between, the, supporters, and, detractors, of, ordinary, language, philosophy, which, was, ended, when, the, paper, published, an, editorial, critical, of, both, sides, but, agreeing, with, the, opponents, of, ordinary, language, philosophy, in, the, king, s, birthday, honours, of, 9, june, 1949, russell, was, awarded, the, order, of, merit, and, the, following, year, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, when, he, was, given, the, order, of, merit, george, vi, was, affable, but, embarrassed, at, decorating, a, former, jailbird, saying, you, have, sometimes, behaved, in, a, manner, that, would, not, do, if, generally, adopted, russell, merely, smiled, but, afterwards, claimed, that, the, reply, that, s, right, just, like, your, brother, immediately, came, to, mind, in, 1950, russell, attended, the, inaugural, conference, for, the, congress, for, cultural, freedom, a, cia, funded, anti, communist, organisation, committed, to, the, deployment, of, culture, as, a, weapon, during, the, cold, war, russell, was, one, of, the, known, patrons, of, the, congress, until, he, resigned, in, 1956, in, 1952, russell, was, divorced, by, spence, with, whom, he, had, been, very, unhappy, conrad, russell, s, son, by, spence, did, not, see, his, father, between, the, time, of, the, divorce, and, 1968, at, which, time, his, decision, to, meet, his, father, caused, a, permanent, breach, with, his, mother, russell, married, his, fourth, wife, edith, finch, soon, after, the, divorce, on, 15, december, 1952, they, had, known, each, other, since, 1925, and, edith, had, taught, english, at, bryn, mawr, college, near, philadelphia, sharing, a, house, for, 20, years, with, russell, s, old, friend, lucy, donnelly, edith, remained, with, him, until, his, death, and, by, all, accounts, their, marriage, was, a, happy, close, and, loving, one, russell, s, eldest, son, john, suffered, from, mental, illness, which, was, the, source, of, ongoing, disputes, between, russell, and, his, former, wife, dora, in, 1962, russell, played, a, public, role, in, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, an, exchange, of, telegrams, with, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, khrushchev, assured, him, that, the, soviet, government, would, not, be, reckless, russell, sent, this, telegram, to, president, kennedy, your, action, desperate, threat, to, human, survival, no, conceivable, justification, civilized, man, condemns, it, we, will, not, have, mass, murder, ultimatum, means, war, end, this, madness, according, to, historian, peter, knight, after, jfk, s, assassination, russell, prompted, by, the, emerging, work, of, the, lawyer, mark, lane, in, the, us, rallied, support, from, other, noteworthy, and, left, leaning, compatriots, to, form, a, who, killed, kennedy, committee, in, june, 1964, members, of, which, included, michael, foot, mp, caroline, benn, the, publisher, victor, gollancz, the, writers, john, arden, and, j, b, priestley, and, the, oxford, history, professor, hugh, trevor, roper, russell, published, a, highly, critical, article, in, the, minority, of, one, weeks, before, the, warren, commission, report, was, published, setting, forth, 16, questions, on, the, assassination, russell, equated, the, oswald, case, with, the, dreyfus, affair, of, late, 19th, century, france, in, which, the, state, convicted, an, innocent, man, russell, also, criticised, the, american, press, for, failing, to, heed, any, voices, critical, of, the, official, version, bertrand, russell, was, opposed, to, war, from, a, young, age, his, opposition, to, world, war, i, being, used, as, grounds, for, his, dismissal, from, trinity, college, at, cambridge, this, incident, fused, two, of, his, controversial, causes, as, he, had, failed, to, be, granted, fellow, status, which, would, have, protected, him, from, firing, because, he, was, not, willing, to, either, pretend, to, be, a, devout, christian, or, at, least, avoid, admitting, he, was, agnostic, he, later, described, the, resolution, of, these, issues, as, essential, to, freedom, of, thought, and, expression, citing, the, incident, in, free, thought, and, official, propaganda, where, he, explained, that, the, expression, of, any, idea, even, the, most, obviously, bad, must, be, protected, not, only, from, direct, state, intervention, but, also, economic, leveraging, and, other, means, of, being, silenced, the, opinions, which, are, still, persecuted, strike, the, majority, as, so, monstrous, and, immoral, that, the, general, principle, of, toleration, cannot, be, held, to, apply, to, them, but, this, is, exactly, the, same, view, as, that, which, made, possible, the, tortures, of, the, inquisition, russell, spent, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, engaged, in, political, causes, primarily, related, to, nuclear, disarmament, and, opposing, the, vietnam, war, the, 1955, russell, einstein, manifesto, was, a, document, calling, for, nuclear, disarmament, and, was, signed, by, eleven, of, the, most, prominent, nuclear, physicists, and, intellectuals, of, the, time, in, october, 1960, the, committee, of, 100, was, formed, with, a, declaration, by, russell, and, michael, scott, entitled, act, or, perish, which, called, for, a, movement, of, nonviolent, resistance, to, nuclear, war, and, weapons, of, mass, destruction, in, september, 1961, at, the, age, of, 89, russell, was, jailed, for, seven, days, in, brixton, prison, for, a, breach, of, the, peace, after, taking, part, in, an, anti, nuclear, demonstration, in, london, the, magistrate, offered, to, exempt, him, from, jail, if, he, pledged, himself, to, good, behaviour, to, which, russell, replied, no, i, won, t, from, 1966, to, 1967, russell, worked, with, jean, paul, sartre, and, many, other, intellectual, figures, to, form, the, russell, vietnam, war, crimes, tribunal, to, investigate, the, conduct, of, the, united, states, in, vietnam, he, wrote, many, letters, to, world, leaders, during, this, period, early, in, his, life, russell, supported, eugenicist, policies, in, 1894, he, proposed, that, the, state, issue, certificates, of, health, to, prospective, parents, and, withhold, public, benefits, from, those, considered, unfit, in, 1929, he, wrote, that, people, deemed, mentally, defective, and, feebleminded, should, be, sexually, sterilised, because, they, are, apt, to, have, enormous, numbers, of, illegitimate, children, all, as, a, rule, wholly, useless, to, the, community, russell, was, also, an, advocate, of, population, control, the, nations, which, at, present, increase, rapidly, should, be, encouraged, to, adopt, the, methods, by, which, in, the, west, the, increase, of, population, has, been, checked, educational, propaganda, with, government, help, could, achieve, this, result, in, a, generation, there, are, however, two, powerful, forces, opposed, to, such, a, policy, one, is, religion, the, other, is, nationalism, i, think, it, is, the, duty, of, all, to, proclaim, that, opposition, to, the, spread, of, birth, is, appalling, depth, of, misery, and, degradation, and, that, within, another, fifty, years, or, so, i, do, not, pretend, that, birth, control, is, the, only, way, in, which, population, can, be, kept, from, increasing, there, are, others, which, one, must, suppose, opponents, of, birth, control, would, prefer, war, as, i, remarked, a, moment, ago, has, hitherto, been, disappointing, in, this, respect, but, perhaps, bacteriological, war, may, prove, more, effective, if, a, black, death, could, be, spread, throughout, the, whole, world, once, in, every, generation, survivors, could, procreate, freely, without, making, the, world, too, full, on, 20, november, 1948, in, a, public, speech, at, westminster, school, addressing, a, gathering, arranged, by, the, new, commonwealth, russell, shocked, some, observers, by, suggesting, that, a, preemptive, nuclear, strike, on, the, soviet, union, was, justified, russell, argued, that, war, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, seemed, inevitable, so, it, would, be, a, humanitarian, gesture, to, get, it, over, with, quickly, and, have, the, united, states, in, the, dominant, position, currently, russell, argued, humanity, could, survive, such, a, war, whereas, a, full, nuclear, war, after, both, sides, had, manufactured, large, stockpiles, of, more, destructive, weapons, was, likely, to, result, in, the, extinction, of, the, human, race, russell, later, relented, from, this, stance, instead, arguing, for, mutual, disarmament, by, the, nuclear, powers, in, 1956, before, and, during, the, suez, crisis, russell, expressed, his, opposition, to, european, imperialism, in, the, middle, east, he, viewed, the, crisis, as, another, reminder, of, the, pressing, need, for, an, effective, mechanism, for, international, governance, and, to, restrict, national, sovereignty, in, places, such, as, the, suez, canal, area, where, general, interest, is, involved, at, the, same, time, the, suez, crisis, was, taking, place, the, world, was, also, captivated, by, the, hungarian, revolution, and, the, subsequent, crushing, of, the, revolt, by, intervening, soviet, forces, russell, attracted, criticism, for, speaking, out, fervently, against, the, suez, war, while, ignoring, soviet, repression, in, hungary, to, which, he, responded, that, he, did, not, criticise, the, soviets, because, there, was, no, need, most, of, the, so, called, western, world, was, fulminating, although, he, later, feigned, a, lack, of, concern, at, the, time, he, was, disgusted, by, the, brutal, soviet, response, and, on, 16, november, 1956, he, expressed, approval, for, a, declaration, of, support, for, hungarian, scholars, which, michael, polanyi, had, cabled, to, the, soviet, embassy, in, london, twelve, days, previously, shortly, after, soviet, troops, had, entered, budapest, in, november, 1957, russell, wrote, an, article, addressing, us, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, urging, a, summit, to, consider, the, conditions, of, co, existence, khrushchev, responded, that, peace, could, be, served, by, such, a, meeting, in, january, 1958, russell, elaborated, his, views, in, the, observer, proposing, a, cessation, of, all, nuclear, weapons, production, with, the, uk, taking, the, first, step, by, unilaterally, suspending, its, own, nuclear, weapons, program, if, necessary, and, with, germany, freed, from, all, alien, armed, forces, and, pledged, to, neutrality, in, any, conflict, between, east, and, west, us, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, replied, for, eisenhower, the, exchange, of, letters, was, published, as, the, vital, letters, of, russell, khrushchev, and, dulles, russell, was, asked, by, the, new, republic, a, liberal, american, magazine, to, elaborate, his, views, on, world, peace, he, urged, that, all, nuclear, weapons, testing, and, flights, by, planes, armed, with, nuclear, weapons, be, halted, immediately, and, negotiations, be, opened, for, the, destruction, of, all, hydrogen, bombs, with, the, number, of, conventional, nuclear, devices, limited, to, ensure, a, balance, of, power, he, proposed, that, germany, be, reunified, and, accept, the, oder, neisse, line, as, its, border, and, that, a, neutral, zone, be, established, in, central, europe, consisting, at, the, minimum, of, germany, poland, hungary, and, czechoslovakia, with, each, of, these, countries, being, free, of, foreign, troops, and, influence, and, prohibited, from, forming, alliances, with, countries, outside, the, zone, in, the, middle, east, russell, suggested, that, the, west, avoid, opposing, arab, nationalism, and, proposed, the, creation, of, a, united, nations, peacekeeping, force, to, guard, israel, s, frontiers, to, ensure, that, israel, was, prevented, from, committing, aggression, and, protected, from, it, he, also, suggested, western, recognition, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, that, it, be, admitted, to, the, un, with, a, permanent, seat, on, the, un, security, council, he, was, in, contact, with, lionel, rogosin, while, the, latter, was, filming, his, anti, war, film, good, times, wonderful, times, in, the, 1960s, he, became, a, hero, to, many, of, the, youthful, members, of, the, new, left, in, early, 1963, russell, became, increasingly, vocal, in, his, disapproval, of, the, vietnam, war, and, felt, that, the, us, government, s, policies, there, were, near, genocidal, in, 1963, he, became, the, inaugural, recipient, of, the, jerusalem, prize, an, award, for, writers, concerned, with, the, freedom, of, the, individual, in, society, in, 1964, he, was, one, of, eleven, world, figures, who, issued, an, appeal, to, israel, and, the, arab, countries, to, accept, an, arms, embargo, and, international, supervision, of, nuclear, plants, and, rocket, weaponry, in, october, 1965, he, tore, up, his, labour, party, card, because, he, suspected, harold, wilson, s, labour, government, was, going, to, send, troops, to, support, the, united, states, in, vietnam, in, june, 1955, russell, had, leased, plas, penrhyn, in, penrhyndeudraeth, merionethshire, wales, and, on, 5, july, of, the, following, year, it, became, his, and, edith, s, principal, residence, russell, published, his, three, volume, autobiography, in, 1967, 1968, and, 1969, he, made, a, cameo, appearance, playing, himself, in, the, anti, war, hindi, film, aman, by, mohan, kumar, which, was, released, in, india, in, 1967, this, was, russell, s, only, appearance, in, a, feature, film, on, 23, november, 1969, he, wrote, to, the, times, newspaper, saying, that, the, preparation, for, show, trials, in, czechoslovakia, was, highly, alarming, the, same, month, he, appealed, to, secretary, general, u, thant, of, the, united, nations, to, support, an, international, war, crimes, commission, to, investigate, alleged, torture, and, genocide, by, the, united, states, in, south, vietnam, during, the, vietnam, war, the, following, month, he, protested, to, alexei, kosygin, over, the, expulsion, of, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, from, the, soviet, union, of, writers, on, 31, january, 1970, russell, issued, a, statement, condemning, israel, s, aggression, in, the, middle, east, and, in, particular, israeli, bombing, raids, being, carried, out, deep, in, egyptian, territory, as, part, of, the, war, of, attrition, which, he, compared, to, german, bombing, raids, in, the, battle, of, britain, and, the, us, bombing, of, vietnam, he, called, for, an, israeli, withdrawal, to, the, pre, six, day, war, borders, stating, the, aggression, committed, by, israel, must, be, condemned, not, only, because, no, state, has, the, right, to, annexe, foreign, territory, but, because, every, expansion, is, an, experiment, to, discover, how, much, more, aggression, the, world, will, tolerate, this, was, russell, s, final, political, statement, or, act, it, was, read, out, at, the, international, conference, of, parliamentarians, in, cairo, on, 3, february, 1970, the, day, after, his, death, russell,

brand, blanshard, asked, russell, why, he, did, not, write, on, aesthetics, russell, replied, that, he, did, not, know, anything, about, it, though, he, hastened, to, add, but, that, is, not, a, very, good, excuse, for, my, friends, tell, me, it, has, not, deterred, me, from, writing, on, other, subjects, on, ethics, russell, wrote, that, he, was, a, utilitarian, in, his, youth, yet, he, later, distanced, himself, from, this, view, for, the, advancement, of, science, and, protection, of, liberty, of, expression, russell, advocated, the, will, to, doubt, the, recognition, that, all, human, knowledge, is, at, most, a, best, guess, that, one, should, always, remember, none, of, our, beliefs, are, quite, true, all, have, at, least, a, penumbra, of, vagueness, and, error, the, methods, of, increasing, the, degree, of, truth, in, our, beliefs, are, well, known, they, consist, in, hearing, all, sides, trying, to, ascertain, all, the, relevant, facts, controlling, our, own, bias, by, discussion, with, people, who, have, the, opposite, bias, and, cultivating, a, readiness, to, discard, any, hypothesis, which, has, proved, inadequate, these, methods, are, practised, in, science, and, have, built, up, the, body, of, scientific, knowledge, every, man, of, science, whose, outlook, is, truly, scientific, is, ready, to, admit, that, what, passes, for, scientific, knowledge, at, the, moment, is, sure, to, require, correction, with, the, progress, of, discovery, nevertheless, it, is, near, enough, to, the, truth, to, serve, for, most, practical, purposes, though, not, for, all, in, science, where, alone, something, approximating, to, genuine, knowledge, is, to, be, found, men, s, attitude, is, tentative, and, full, of, doubt, russell, described, himself, in, 1947, as, an, agnostic, or, an, atheist, he, found, it, difficult, to, determine, which, term, to, adopt, saying, therefore, in, regard, to, the, olympic, gods, speaking, to, a, purely, philosophical, audience, i, would, say, that, i, am, an, agnostic, but, speaking, popularly, i, think, that, all, of, us, would, say, in, regard, to, those, gods, that, we, were, atheists, in, regard, to, the, christian, god, i, should, i, think, take, exactly, the, same, line, for, most, of, his, adult, life, russell, maintained, religion, to, be, little, more, than, superstition, and, despite, any, positive, effects, largely, harmful, to, people, he, believed, that, religion, and, the, religious, outlook, serve, to, impede, knowledge, and, foster, fear, and, dependency, and, to, be, responsible, for, much, of, our, world, s, wars, oppression, and, misery, he, was, a, member, of, the, advisory, council, of, the, british, humanist, association, and, president, of, cardiff, humanists, until, his, death, political, and, social, activism, occupied, much, of, russell, s, time, for, most, of, his, life, russell, remained, politically, active, almost, to, the, end, of, his, life, writing, to, and, exhorting, world, leaders, and, lending, his, name, to, various, causes, he, was, a, prominent, campaigner, against, western, intervention, into, the, vietnam, war, in, the, 1960s, writing, essays, books, attending, demonstrations, and, even, organising, the, russell, tribunal, in, 1966, alongside, other, prominent, philosophers, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, and, simone, de, beauvoir, which, fed, into, his, 1967, book, war, crimes, in, vietnam, russell, argued, for, a, scientific, society, where, war, would, be, abolished, population, growth, would, be, limited, and, prosperity, would, be, shared, he, suggested, the, establishment, of, a, single, supreme, world, government, able, to, enforce, peace, claiming, that, the, only, thing, that, will, redeem, mankind, is, co, operation, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a, world, constituent, assembly, convened, to, draft, and, adopt, the, constitution, for, the, federation, of, earth, russell, also, expressed, support, for, guild, socialism, and, commented, positively, on, several, socialist, thinkers, and, activists, according, to, jean, bricmont, and, normand, baillargeon, russell, was, both, a, liberal, and, a, socialist, a, combination, that, was, perfectly, comprehensible, in, his, time, but, which, has, become, almost, unthinkable, today, he, was, a, liberal, in, that, he, opposed, concentrations, of, power, in, all, its, manifestations, military, governmental, or, religious, as, well, as, the, superstitious, or, nationalist, ideas, that, usually, serve, as, its, justification, but, he, was, also, a, socialist, even, as, an, extension, of, his, liberalism, because, he, was, equally, opposed, to, the, concentrations, of, power, stemming, from, the, private, ownership, of, the, major, means, of, production, which, therefore, needed, to, be, put, under, social, control, which, does, not, mean, state, control, russell, was, an, active, supporter, of, the, homosexual, law, reform, society, being, one, of, the, signatories, of, a, e, dyson, s, 1958, letter, to, the, times, calling, for, a, change, in, the, law, regarding, male, homosexual, practices, which, were, partly, legalised, in, 1967, when, russell, was, still, alive, he, expressed, sympathy, and, support, for, the, palestinian, people, and, was, critical, of, israel, s, actions, he, wrote, in, 1960, that, i, think, it, was, a, mistake, to, establish, a, jewish, state, in, palestine, but, it, would, be, a, still, greater, mistake, to, try, to, get, rid, of, it, now, that, it, exists, in, his, final, written, document, read, aloud, in, cairo, three, days, after, his, death, on, 31, january, 1970, he, condemned, israel, as, an, aggressive, imperialist, power, which, wishes, to, consolidate, with, the, least, difficulty, what, it, has, already, taken, by, violence, every, new, conquest, becomes, the, new, basis, of, the, proposed, negotiation, from, strength, which, ignores, the, injustice, of, the, previous, aggression, in, regards, to, the, palestinian, people, and, refugees, he, wrote, that, no, people, anywhere, in, the, world, would, accept, being, expelled, en, masse, from, their, own, country, how, can, anyone, require, the, people, of, palestine, to, accept, a, punishment, which, nobody, else, would, tolerate, a, permanent, just, settlement, of, the, refugees, in, their, homeland, is, an, essential, ingredient, of, any, genuine, settlement, in, the, middle, east, russell, advocated, and, was, one, of, the, first, people, in, the, uk, to, suggest, a, universal, basic, income, in, his, 1918, book, roads, to, freedom, russell, wrote, that, anarchism, has, the, advantage, as, regards, liberty, socialism, as, regards, the, inducement, to, work, can, we, not, find, a, method, of, combining, these, two, advantages, it, seems, to, me, that, we, can, stated, in, more, familiar, terms, the, plan, we, are, advocating, amounts, essentially, to, this, that, a, certain, small, income, sufficient, for, necessaries, should, be, secured, to, all, whether, they, work, or, not, and, that, a, larger, income, as, much, larger, as, might, be, warranted, by, the, total, amount, of, commodities, produced, should, be, given, to, those, who, are, willing, to, engage, in, some, work, which, the, community, recognizes, as, useful, when, education, is, finished, no, one, should, be, compelled, to, work, and, those, who, choose, not, to, work, should, receive, a, bare, livelihood, and, be, left, completely, free, in, reflections, on, my, eightieth, birthday, postscript, in, his, autobiography, russell, wrote, i, have, lived, in, the, pursuit, of, a, vision, both, personal, and, social, personal, to, care, for, what, is, noble, for, what, is, beautiful, for, what, is, gentle, to, allow, moments, of, insight, to, give, wisdom, at, more, mundane, times, social, to, see, in, imagination, the, society, that, is, to, be, created, where, individuals, grow, freely, and, where, hate, and, greed, and, envy, die, because, there, is, nothing, to, nourish, them, these, things, i, believe, and, the, world, for, all, its, horrors, has, left, me, unshaken, russell, supported, freedom, of, opinion, and, was, an, opponent, of, both, censorship, and, indoctrination, in, 1928, he, wrote, the, fundamental, argument, for, freedom, of, opinion, is, the, doubtfulness, of, all, our, belief, when, the, state, intervenes, to, ensure, the, indoctrination, of, some, doctrine, it, does, so, because, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, in, favour, of, that, doctrine, it, is, clear, that, thought, is, not, free, if, the, profession, of, certain, opinions, make, it, impossible, to, make, a, living, in, 1957, he, wrote, free, thought, means, thinking, freely, to, be, worthy, of, the, name, freethinker, he, must, be, free, of, two, things, the, force, of, tradition, and, the, tyranny, of, his, own, passions, russell, has, presented, ideas, on, the, possible, means, of, control, of, education, in, case, of, scientific, dictatorship, governments, of, the, kind, of, this, excerpt, taken, from, chapter, ii, general, effects, of, scientific, technique, of, the, impact, of, science, on, society, this, subject, will, make, great, strides, when, it, is, taken, up, by, scientists, under, a, scientific, dictatorship, anaxagoras, maintained, that, snow, is, black, but, no, one, believed, him, the, social, psychologists, of, the, future, will, have, a, number, of, classes, of, school, children, on, whom, they, will, try, different, methods, of, producing, an, unshakable, conviction, that, snow, is, black, various, results, will, soon, be, arrived, at, first, that, the, influence, of, home, is, obstructive, second, that, not, much, can, be, done, unless, indoctrination, begins, before, the, age, of, ten, third, that, verses, set, to, music, and, repeatedly, intoned, are, very, effective, fourth, that, the, opinion, that, snow, is, white, must, be, held, to, show, a, morbid, taste, for, eccentricity, but, i, anticipate, it, is, for, future, scientists, to, make, these, maxims, precise, and, discover, exactly, how, much, it, costs, per, head, to, make, children, believe, that, snow, is, black, and, how, much, less, it, would, cost, to, make, them, believe, it, is, dark, grey, although, this, science, will, be, diligently, studied, it, will, be, rigidly, confined, to, the, governing, class, the, populace, will, not, be, allowed, to, know, how, its, convictions, were, generated, when, the, technique, has, been, perfected, every, government, that, has, been, in, charge, of, education, for, a, generation, will, be, able, to, control, its, subjects, securely, without, the, need, of, armies, or, policemen, as, yet, there, is, only, one, country, which, has, succeeded, in, creating, this, politician, s, paradise, the, social, effects, of, scientific, technique, have, already, been, many, and, important, and, are, likely, to, be, even, more, noteworthy, in, the, future, some, of, these, effects, depend, upon, the, political, and, economic, character, of, the, country, concerned, others, are, inevitable, whatever, this, character, may, be, he, pushed, his, visionary, scenarios, even, further, into, details, in, the, chapter, iii, scientific, technique, in, an, oligarchy, of, the, same, book, stating, as, an, example, in, future, such, failures, are, not, likely, to, occur, where, there, is, dictatorship, diet, injections, and, injunctions, will, combine, from, a, very, early, age, to, produce, the, sort, of, character, and, the, sort, of, beliefs, that, the, authorities, consider, desirable, and, any, serious, criticism, of, the, powers, that, be, will, become, psychologically, impossible, even, if, all, are, miserable, all, will, believe, themselves, happy, because, the, government, will, tell, them, that, they, are, so, below, are, selected, russell, s, works, in, english, sorted, by, year, of, first, publication, russell, was, the, author, of, more, than, sixty, books, and, over, two, thousand, articles, additionally, he, wrote, many, pamphlets, introductions, and, letters, to, the, editor, one, pamphlet, titled, i, appeal, unto, caesar, the, case, of, the, conscientious, objectors, ghostwritten, for, margaret, hobhouse, the, mother, of, imprisoned, peace, activist, stephen, hobhouse, allegedly, helped, secure, the, release, from, prison, of, hundreds, of, conscientious, objectors, his, works, can, be, found, in, anthologies, and, collections, including, the, collected, papers, of, bertrand, russell, which, mcmaster, university, began, publishing, in, 1983, by, march, 2017, this, collection, of, his, shorter, and, previously, unpublished, works, included, 18, volumes, and, several, more, are, in,
