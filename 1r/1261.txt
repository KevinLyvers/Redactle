influence, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, on, the, other, hand, it, was, also, during, his, rule, that, the, seeds, of, decline, surfaced, considerable, contributions, to, the, arts, and, architecture, as, well, as, military, victories, were, tarnished, by, intrigues, and, religious, persecutions, he, was, commemorated, in, warsaw, by, sigismund, s, column, one, of, the, city, s, chief, landmarks, and, the, first, secular, monument, in, the, form, of, a, column, in, modern, history, it, was, commissioned, after, sigismund, s, death, by, his, son, and, successor, w, adys, aw,

wing, in, poland, at, the, time, sigismund, was, raised, as, a, roman, catholic, his, mother, catherine, was, the, daughter, of, polish, king, sigismund, the, old, and, bona, sforza, of, milan, all, of, whom, where, practicing, catholics, sigismund, s, older, sister, isabella, died, aged, two, in, 1566, his, younger, sister, anna, was, a, lutheran, but, the, close, relationship, between, the, two, siblings, remained, unchanged, until, her, death, in, 1625, in, october, 1567, sigismund, and, his, parents, were, released, from, prison, at, the, request, of, his, uncle, charles, in, january,

born, as, a, child, sigismund, was, tutored, in, both, polish, and, swedish, thus, making, him, bilingual, he, was, also, proficient, in, german, italian, and, latin, catherine, ensured, that, her, son, was, educated, in, the, spirit, of, catholicism, and, polish, patriotism, the, young, prince, was, made, aware, of, his, blood, connection, to, the, jagiellonian, dynasty, which, ruled, poland, in, its, finest, period, for, two, hundred, years, although, sigismund, in, his, youth, enjoyed, reading, and, learning, observers, did, not, acknowledge, his, intelligence, he, was, handsome, rather, tall, and, of, slim, build, but, timid, and, an, introvert, who, became, heavily, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, the, church, nevertheless, sigismund, was, undoubtedly, multitalented, and, artistically, inclined, in, 1587, sigismund, stood, for, election, to, the, polish, throne, after, the, death, of, stephen, b, thory, his, candidacy, was, secured, by, queen, dowager, anna, and, several, elite, magnates, who, considered, him, a, native, candidate, as, a, descendant, of, the, jagiellons, though, the, election, was, openly, questioned, and, opposed, by, the, nobles, politically, associated, with, the, zborowski, family, with, the, blessing, of, primate, stanis, aw, karnkowski, and, strong, support, from, other, people, of, influence, he, was, duly, elected, ruler, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, on, 19, august, 1587, his, official, name, and, title, became, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, poland, grand, duke, of, lithuania, ruler, of, ruthenia, prussia, masovia, samogitia, livonia, and, also, hereditary, king, of, the, swedes, goths, and, wends, the, latter, titles, being, a, reference, to, the, fact, that, he, was, already, the, crown, prince, of, sweden, and, thus, would, lawfully, succeed, to, the, throne, of, sweden, upon, the, death, of, his, father, the, outcome, of, the, election, was, strongly, contested, by, factions, of, the, polish, nobility, that, backed, the, candidacy, of, archduke, maximilian, iii, of, austria, who, launched, a, military, expedition, when, the, news, reached, sigismund, in, sweden, he, crossed, the, baltic, and, landed, in, poland, on, 7, october, immediately, agreeing, to, grant, royal, privileges, to, the, sejm, parliament, in, the, hope, of, calming, the, opposition, and, settling, the, disputed, election, he, was, proclaimed, king, by, treasurer, jan, dulski, on, behalf, of, crown, marshal, andrzej, opali, ski, and, after, arriving, in, the, royal, capital, city, of, krak, w, he, was, crowned, on, 27, december, at, wawel, cathedral, sigismund, s, position, was, solidified, when, jan, zamoyski, defeated, maximilian, at, the, battle, of, byczyna, and, took, him, prisoner, at, the, request, of, pope, sixtus, v, the, archduke, was, then, released, and, in, turn, surrendered, his, claim, to, poland, in, 1589, he, was, also, successful, in, maintaining, peace, with, his, powerful, southern, neighbour, by, marrying, archduchess, anne, of, habsburg, in, 1592, simultaneously, he, secured, an, alliance, with, catholic, austria, against, protestant, foes, when, his, father, died, sigismund, was, granted, permission, by, the, polish, diet, to, claim, the, swedish, crown, which, he, had, inherited, from, his, father, the, swedes, who, previously, declared, john, iii, a, catholic, conspirator, and, traitor, became, lenient, when, the, new, monarch, pledged, to, respect, lutheranism, as, the, country, s, new, state, religion, sigismund, was, crowned, at, uppsala, on, 19, february, 1594, but, his, promise, to, uphold, the, protestant, faith, in, sweden, began, on, shaky, ground, as, demonstrated, by, the, presence, of, a, papal, nuncio, in, the, royal, procession, tensions, grew, following, his, coronation, sigismund, remained, a, devout, roman, catholic, and, left, the, country, abruptly, which, made, the, swedes, sceptical, of, their, new, ruler, after, returning, to, poland, he, appointed, his, uncle, duke, charles, to, rule, as, his, regent, sigismund, s, ultimate, intention, was, to, reinstate, catholicism, in, sweden, by, force, if, necessary, the, jesuits, often, acted, as, agents, refuting, protestantism, and, promoting, catholicism, in, the, country, the, hostility, between, chancellor, jan, zamoyski, and, sigismund, began, as, soon, as, he, arrived, in, poland, from, sweden, to, claim, the, crown, zamoyski, a, patriotic, brawler, along, with, other, magnates, were, critical, of, the, young, king, s, liking, for, the, habsburg, culture, certain, habits, and, impassive, cold, character, according, to, historian, and, writer, julian, ursyn, niemcewicz, zamoyski, was, said, to, have, exclaimed, what, a, mute, have, you, brought, to, us, upon, meeting, the, king, in, october, 1587, the, chancellor, was, initially, supportive, of, sigismund, s, candidacy, due, to, his, maternal, lineage, during, the, first, parliament, sitting, the, so, called, pacification, sejm, in, march, 1589, zamoyski, proposed, extensive, reforms, of, the, electoral, system, notably, he, presented, the, idea, that, only, a, member, of, a, local, native, dynasty, should, be, eligible, to, the, polish, throne, in, the, future, entailing, the, permanent, exclusion, of, any, habsburg, candidates, sigismund, saw, a, potential, ally, in, austria, he, sought, to, establish, a, catholic, league, that, would, actively, engage, in, the, counter, reformation, zamoyski, openly, condemned, sigismund, for, associating, with, the, habsburgs, particularly, archduke, ernest, and, speculated, that, ernest, was, to, be, the, potential, successor, if, sigismund, abdicated, and, returned, to, sweden, the, anti, austrian, sentiment, was, only, explicable, as, a, circuitous, attempt, to, traverse, the, habsburg, hegemony, and, influence, in, central, europe, which, zamoyski, perceived, as, a, major, threat, however, the, parliament, immediately, rejected, the, proposal, and, ruled, in, favour, of, austria, thus, also, accepting, a, marriage, between, sigismund, and, anne, of, habsburg, furthermore, the, reestablishment, of, peaceful, relations, with, austria, was, dictated, by, the, treaty, of, bytom, and, b, dzin, from, march, 1589, which, was, negotiated, by, ippolito, aldobrandini, future, pope, clement, viii, at, the, subsequent, sejm, session, assembled, in, march, 1590, zamoyski, persuaded, the, gathered, deputies, and, representatives, to, exclude, archduke, maximilian, from, future, candidacy, to, the, throne, describing, the, possibility, of, austrian, intrigues, and, the, looming, threat, of, the, turkish, empire, his, opponents, headed, by, primate, karnkowski, formed, an, informal, confederation, immediately, after, the, sejm, rose, to, protest, the, decrees, all, of, the, decrees, of, the, first, sejm, were, rescinded, by, a, second, sejm, which, sat, at, the, end, of, the, same, year, the, hetmanship, was, suspended, the, party, of, maximilian, was, amnestied, the, zborowskis, were, rehabilitated, and, zamoyski, s, counterparts, were, removed, from, the, royal, court, tensions, grew, further, over, the, ownership, of, estonia, between, sweden, and, poland, following, the, dissolution, of, the, livonian, order, zamoyski, held, sigismund, accountable, for, the, dispute, sigismund, s, leniency, towards, the, habsburgs, also, alienated, some, clerics, the, austrians, wanted, to, prevent, andrew, b, thory, from, seizing, the, bishopric, of, krak, w, and, succeeded, in, doing, so, by, diplomatic, coaxing, or, coercion, the, new, papal, nuncio, annibale, di, capua, a, staunch, habsburg, supporter, eventually, convinced, sigismund, to, nominate, jerzy, radziwi, after, piotr, myszkowski, died, on, 5, april, 1591, capua, stressed, that, andrew, had, not, been, an, ordained, priest, and, was, not, legally, capable, to, become, bishop, the, decision, strained, the, once, friendly, relations, between, poland, and, transylvania, as, outlined, by, oskar, halecki, the, king, s, friends, were, largely, recruited, from, the, higher, clergy, and, the, jesuits, who, violated, the, 1573, warsaw, confederation, guaranteeing, religious, freedoms, in, poland, and, lithuania, as, persecution, loomed, political, dissidents, grouped, and, formed, factions, which, called, for, adherence, to, the, laws, of, the, confederation, zamoyski, joined, the, dissidents, and, when, sigismund, failed, to, prevent, mob, violence, directed, against, non, catholics, in, vilnius, and, krak, w, in, 1591, he, summoned, several, conventions, that, demanded, the, guarantees, of, security, sigismund, yielded, to, their, demands, however, he, forbade, any, future, conventions, which, could, destabilize, the, state, the, prohibition, did, not, have, a, lasting, effect, and, gatherings, of, dissidents, continued, in, the, following, year, the, opposition, hoped, to, thwart, the, match, with, archduchess, anne, of, habsburg, whose, state, entry, into, krak, w, at, the, end, of, may, was, greatly, celebrated, sigismund, disregarded, any, protest, in, regards, to, the, marriage, consequently, on, 1, june, 1592, zamoyski, formed, another, confederation, at, j, drzej, w, latin, andreiow, attended, by, the, most, eminent, and, distinguished, magnates, among, them, miko, aj, zebrzydowski, and, stanis, aw, kiewski, at, andreiow, he, allegedly, exposed, proof, concerning, a, plot, that, would, place, archduke, ernest, on, the, throne, if, sigismund, was, to, abdicate, zamoyski, s, claim, caused, an, uproar, on, 7, september, sigismund, summoned, the, warsaw, inquisition, sejm, sejm, inkwizycyjny, to, inquire, into, the, so, called, austrian, cabals, zamoyski, s, strong, argument, against, that, of, the, monarch, was, so, persuasive, that, elderly, karnkowski, sided, with, the, chancellor, and, his, supporters, who, abstained, from, kissing, the, king, s, hand, upon, arrival, as, the, custom, required, alleged, letters, and, private, correspondence, between, sigismund, and, ernest, with, the, royal, signature, was, presented, as, evidence, the, king, rebuked, these, accusations, his, aides, attributed, the, falsified, signature, to, the, court, scribe, who, was, subsequently, imprisoned, at, dzia, dowo, soldau, tortured, but, pleaded, not, guilty, the, opposition, extended, their, demands, and, asked, for, the, immediate, removal, of, all, foreign, dignitaries, from, the, court, including, mercenaries, which, was, not, fully, enforced, the, sejm, had, no, definite, outcome, most, of, the, gathered, nobles, and, diplomats, dispersed, as, further, incrimination, of, the, sovereign, proved, futile, and, detrimental, to, the, stability, of, the, state, there, is, little, evidence, or, written, works, from, the, period, concerning, the, terms, under, which, the, sejm, functioned, or, how, it, concluded, niemcewicz, largely, attributed, the, victory, to, sigismund, the, measures, of, the, counter, reformation, strengthened, and, within, a, year, many, of, the, convention, s, attendees, died, acquiescent, nobles, favourable, to, the, king, were, appointed, as, their, successors, thus, making, his, position, less, vulnerable, the, rivalry, between, sigismund, and, zamoyski, continued, until, the, latter, s, death, in, 1605, the, uppsala, resolution, of, 1594, dictated, the, rights, and, securities, of, protestants, in, sweden, it, promised, to, uphold, the, lutheran, faith, in, the, country, forbade, non, lutherans, from, being, appointed, to, office, or, participating, in, the, educational, system, and, prevented, sigismund, from, freely, raising, taxes, for, war, however, the, resolution, was, undermined, whenever, possible, with, military, backing, sigismund, installed, his, own, commanders, in, swedish, castles, and, made, them, responsible, directly, to, him, he, established, the, office, of, regional, governor, st, th, llare, and, appointed, charles, lifelong, enemy, klaus, fleming, as, the, overlord, of, finland, the, governors, served, notice, that, they, would, abstain, from, persecuting, catholicism, in, their, administered, territories, erik, brahe, a, roman, catholic, became, the, governor, of, sweden, s, capital, city, stockholm, in, defiance, of, the, 1594, charter, which, sparked, widespread, anger, on, 4, august, 1594, sigismund, decreed, that, the, swedish, parliament, riksdag, had, no, right, to, function, without, royal, consent, despite, this, charles, summoned, a, parliament, at, s, derk, ping, in, autumn, of, 1595, at, which, he, declared, himself, regent, and, head, of, government, who, would, govern, sweden, reciprocally, with, the, privy, council, during, the, king, s, absence, from, the, realm, the, finnish, nobility, led, by, fleming, rejected, this, resolution, and, so, did, sigismund, s, emissary, who, ordered, him, in, the, name, of, the, king, to, resign, fleming, sympathised, with, sigismund, and, considered, charles, a, rebel, in, response, charles, instigated, a, brief, revolt, against, fleming, among, the, peasants, under, jaakko, ilkka, in, the, province, of, ostrobothnia, known, today, as, the, cudgel, war, as, outlined, by, historian, gary, dean, peterson, fleming, might, have, quelled, the, rebellion, but, it, was, charles, who, took, advantage, of, the, brutality, of, fleming, s, men, and, started, a, successful, propaganda, war, the, prospects, of, polish, and, catholic, domination, over, sweden, became, uncertain, when, klaus, fleming, died, on, 13, april, 1597, he, was, succeeded, by, arvid, st, larm, the, younger, who, did, not, accede, to, swedish, demands, and, awaited, charles, intervention, in, finland, meanwhile, the, nobility, dispersed, erik, gustafsson, stenbock, arvid, gustafsson, stenbock, erik, sparre, erik, brahe, and, sten, ban, r, fled, to, entreat, sigismund, to, return, and, counter, charles, in, 1597, a, civil, war, erupted, and, duke, charles, was, able, to, assume, control, over, a, large, share, of, the, powerful, castles, in, sweden, and, in, this, manner, achieved, control, over, almost, all, the, realm, however, finland, remained, loyal, to, sigismund, and, resisted, in, september, 1597, he, sailed, for, the, finnish, coast, and, seized, bo, castle, from, fleming, s, widow, ebba, stenbock, by, the, end, of, the, month, charles, s, troops, were, not, prepared, nor, strong, enough, to, conquer, or, hold, finland, in, its, entirety, they, sailed, back, to, stockholm, in, october, and, st, larm, retook, bo, the, same, year, as, noted, by, envoys, several, high, ranking, noblemen, fighting, for, sigismund, s, cause, were, instantaneously, sent, to, the, scaffold, further, tensions, and, escalation, of, violence, as, well, as, charles, s, unpredictable, stance, persuaded, sigismund, to, intervene, christian, iv, of, denmark, agreed, to, cooperate, but, would, not, join, the, armed, conflict, the, major, seaports, of, danzig, gda, sk, l, beck, and, rostock, were, pressured, to, sever, trade, with, sweden, polish, privateers, began, to, violently, attack, swedish, vessels, in, the, baltic, by, february, 1598, sigismund, assembled, an, army, consisting, of, approximately, 5, 000, men, on, 23, july, 1598, the, army, left, danzig, gda, sk, with, eighty, transports, several, warships, and, exiled, members, of, the, swedish, parliament, eight, days, later, they, landed, in, kalmar, which, surrendered, without, a, fight, after, the, fall, of, kalmar, charles, found, himself, with, major, trouble, on, his, hands, the, polish, crown, army, attracted, swedish, followers, and, stockholm, lacking, military, defence, was, easily, taken, with, the, help, of, the, nobility, and, officers, of, g, taland, the, cavalry, of, uppland, soon, joined, the, royalists, and, new, forces, were, mobilised, in, finland, and, estonia, charles, troops, were, greater, in, numbers, but, mostly, comprised, poorly, trained, militias, and, peasants, from, the, friendly, provinces, sigismund, advanced, his, troops, towards, st, ngebro, in, link, ping, where, his, sister, anna, vasa, resided, on, 8, september, charles, executed, a, premature, attack, on, st, ngebro, which, was, quickly, repelled, his, force, was, surrounded, in, the, night, and, massacred, by, the, poles, severed, heads, on, lances, and, spikes, startled, sigismund, who, ordered, an, end, to, the, violence, the, supposed, truce, did, not, come, into, effect, and, on, the, morning, of, 25, september, the, armies, clashed, once, more, in, a, major, engagement, at, the, battle, of, st, ngebro, the, prevailing, fog, was, instrumental, at, hiding, troop, movement, the, swedish, rebels, used, the, opportunity, to, take, the, bridges, on, the, river, st, ng, n, when, sigismund, s, men, were, falsely, led, into, a, truce, and, retreated, to, their, camp, their, attempt, to, regroup, and, form, a, second, defensive, line, proved, futile, and, charles, emerged, victorious, as, the, polish, army, was, also, cut, off, from, supplies, by, superior, swedish, warships, the, peace, agreement, was, sealed, with, a, dinner, at, link, ping, castle, on, 28, september, both, sides, agreed, to, lay, down, arms, and, send, the, troops, back, to, their, home, provinces, except, for, the, king, s, personal, guard, charles, appointments, were, to, be, recognized, and, a, parliament, was, to, be, called, to, settle, any, disputes, the, king, who, was, under, pressure, fearing, for, his, life, without, his, army, and, having, realised, that, he, had, lost, the, political, battle, fled, with, his, sister, during, the, coming, days, to, poland,

queen, s, hand, then, walked, to, the, centre, of, the, chamber, and, as, outlined, by, cecil, began, his, oration, aloud, in, latin, with, such, a, gallant, countenance, as, in, my, life, i, never, beheld, dzia, y, ski, informed, elizabeth, that, sigismund, was, outraged, that, her, vessels, were, capturing, the, ships, of, polish, and, hanseatic, merchants, trading, with, the, spanish, and, indicated, that, sigismund, was, prepared, to, commence, hostilities, over, the, matter, unless, elizabeth, immediately, rescinded, this, policy, and, returned, captured, ships, and, cargo, elizabeth, rose, lionlike, and, rebuked, dzia, y, ski, comparing, his, speech, to, a, declaration, of, war, and, manners, to, that, of, a, herald, than, an, ambassador, she, reminded, him, that, england, was, instrumental, in, halting, the, turkish, advances, and, added, i, can, hardly, believe, that, if, the, king, himself, were, present, he, would, have, used, such, language, sigismund, emerged, successful, in, securing, trade, with, the, spanish, crown, and, with, england, though, the, relations, between, the, two, nations, became, strained, according, to, historians, kavita, mudan, finn, and, valerie, schutte, william, shakespeare, might, have, used, elizabeth, s, political, anger, at, the, polish, ambassador, as, an, inspiration, for, queen, margaret, who, employs, similar, strategies, in, the, play, richard, iii, sigismund, s, attempt, to, grasp, unlimited, authority, resulted, in, the, zebrzydowski, rebellion, an, armed, insurrection, formed, in, 1606, by, hetman, miko, aj, zebrzydowski, jan, szcz, sny, herburt, stanis, aw, stadnicki, aleksander, j, zef, lisowski, and, prince, janusz, radziwi, in, st, yca, and, lublin, it, was, primarily, caused, by, the, growing, dissatisfaction, with, the, monarch, among, the, polish, szlachta, and, wealthy, magnates, the, rebels, disapproved, of, sigismund, s, efforts, to, weaken, the, diplomatic, and, political, capabilities, of, the, nobility, and, to, introduce, an, absolute, monarchy, the, participants, of, the, rebellion, formed, a, war, council, and, outlined, their, demands, in, 67, articles, they, demanded, the, dethronement, of, sigismund, for, breaching, the, henrician, articles, and, stipulated, the, expulsion, of, jesuits, from, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, sejm, was, to, be, granted, the, authority, of, appointing, state, officials, instead, of, the, king, local, officials, were, to, be, elected, and, the, rights, of, protestants, expanded, the, 1607, parliament, rejected, these, conditions, meanwhile, the, nobles, mobilised, in, the, village, of, guz, w, in, 1607, the, polish, royal, army, led, by, hetman, jan, karol, chodkiewicz, was, sent, to, pacify, the, rebels, a, full, scale, battle, ensued, on, 5, july, with, 200, casualties, which, resulted, in, the, victory, of, the, royalist, forces, the, rebellious, nobles, formally, surrendered, to, the, king, at, the, 1609, meeting, of, the, parliament, which, became, known, as, the, pacification, sejm, in, return, for, their, surrender, the, rebels, were, granted, leniency, many, royal, supporters, including, hetman, chodkiewicz, had, exacted, amnesty, for, the, rebels, despite, the, failure, to, overthrow, sigismund, the, rebellion, firmly, established, the, rights, and, privileges, of, nobles, in, the, polish, political, system, confirmed, the, inviolability, of, the, royal, elections, and, religious, tolerance, sigismund, s, major, goals, were, achieving, stability, of, government, combating, protestantism, and, expanding, poland, s, territory, while, the, russians, were, embroiled, in, a, civil, war, known, as, the, time, of, troubles, sigismund, saw, an, opportunity, to, invade, russia, and, take, power, sweden, also, became, involved, but, never, made, a, firm, alliance, with, any, one, side, the, death, of, feodor, i, of, russia, in, 1598, caused, internal, instability, and, a, succession, crisis, upon, the, extinction, of, the, rurik, dynasty, further, setbacks, that, contributed, to, the, escalation, of, violence, was, the, famine, of, 1601, 1603, which, killed, two, million, russians, around, a, third, of, the, population, the, new, tsar, boris, godunov, proved, to, be, an, ineffective, ruler, and, died, after, suffering, a, brain, haemorrhage, in, april, 1605, he, left, one, son, feodor, ii, who, succeeded, him, and, ruled, for, only, a, few, months, until, he, and, godunov, s, widow, were, murdered, under, mysterious, circumstances, in, june, 1605, possibly, on, sigismund, s, orders, simultaneously, various, impostors, and, pretenders, to, the, russian, throne, appeared, claiming, to, be, dmitry, ivanovich, the, youngest, son, of, ivan, the, terrible, who, in, fact, died, in, 1591, after, the, fall, of, sigismund, s, candidates, false, dmitry, i, and, his, polish, wife, marina, mniszech, nicknamed, marinka, the, witch, by, the, russians, vasili, ivanovich, shuysky, was, crowned, as, vasili, iv, the, death, of, false, dmitry, and, widespread, chaos, proved, reason, for, poland, to, prepare, an, invasion, prior, raids, between, 1605, and, 1609, were, conducted, by, polish, nobles, or, adventurers, along, with, hired, cossacks, and, foreign, mercenaries, sigismund, s, primary, intention, was, to, destroy, the, russian, state, and, impose, catholicism, with, the, use, of, force, or, terror, if, necessary, lew, sapieha, grand, chancellor, of, lithuania, sought, neutrality, by, proposing, to, boris, godunov, an, eternal, peace, treaty, between, russia, and, poland, lithuania, but, the, idea, did, not, gain, support, and, was, declined, the, commonwealth, army, under, the, command, of, hetman, stanis, aw, kiewski, crossed, the, border, and, on, 29, september, 1609, laid, siege, to, smolensk, on, 4, july, 1610, at, the, battle, of, klushino, the, outnumbered, polish, force, achieved, a, decisive, victory, over, russian, troops, mostly, due, to, the, tactical, competence, of, the, polish, winged, hussars, the, battle, was, a, major, blow, to, the, russians, tsar, vasili, iv, was, subsequently, ousted, by, the, seven, boyars, and, kiewski, entered, moscow, beginning, the, two, year, tyrannical, occupation, of, the, kremlin, the, seven, boyars, proclaimed, polish, prince, ladislaus, sigismund, s, son, as, the, new, tsar, of, russia, in, june, 1611, smolensk, fell, to, the, poles, the, deposed, vasili, shuysky, was, transported, in, a, caged, wagon, to, warsaw, where, he, paid, tribute, to, sigismund, and, the, senate, at, the, royal, castle, on, 29, october, 1611, he, eventually, died, in, captivity, at, gostynin, he, was, most, likely, poisoned, as, his, brother, died, soon, after, the, polish, army, also, committed, countless, atrocities, while, stationing, in, moscow, in, 1611, kuzma, minin, and, dmitry, pozharsky, formed, a, new, army, to, launch, an, uprising, against, the, polish, occupiers, the, poles, eventually, withdrew, from, moscow, in, september, 1612, after, pillaging, and, burning, the, city, when, news, reached, sigismund, he, hurried, with, a, relief, force, but, was, unable, to, commence, an, attack, the, war, continued, with, little, military, action, until, 1618, when, the, truce, of, deulino, was, signed, which, granted, poland, new, territories, including, the, city, of, smolensk, the, agreement, marked, the, greatest, geographical, expansion, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, until, the, loss, of, livonia, in, 1629, however, russia, was, able, to, retain, independence, and, michael, romanov, was, crowned, tsar, in, 1613, this, established, the, romanov, dynasty, which, ruled, russia, until, the, february, revolution, in, 1917, sigismund, s, personal, ambition, of, ruling, the, vast, lands, in, the, east, as, well, as, converting, its, populace, to, catholicism, ended, in, a, fiasco, according, to, alexander, gillespie, approximately, five, million, russians, died, between, 1598, and, 1613, the, result, of, continuous, conflict, civil, war, instigated, famine, and, sigismund, s, politics, sigismund, sought, to, join, the, catholic, side, of, the, thirty, years, war, but, was, denied, by, the, polish, parliament, british, historian, robert, nisbet, bain, wrote, that, his, plan, was, to, invade, and, possibly, occupy, transylvania, then, an, ottoman, ally, and, therefore, considered, dangerous, to, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, poland, the, r, k, czis, and, gabriel, bethlen, were, sympathetic, with, the, sultan, and, would, counterattack, if, the, opportunity, arose, bain, further, highlighted, that, the, chief, pillars, of, military, strength, in, poland, including, stanis, aw, kiewski, warmly, approved, of, the, king, s, policy, in, this, respect, but, it, proved, to, be, impracticable, the, parliament, s, non, interventionist, stance, went, so, far, that, it, refused, to, grant, any, subsidies, for, the, swedish, wars, the, indecision, and, political, opposition, weakened, the, alliance, between, the, habsburg, states, and, the, commonwealth, polish, mercenaries, did, however, join, the, holy, roman, empire, in, combat, at, the, battle, of, humenn, against, transylvania, the, principality, of, moldavia, was, a, polish, fief, since, the, middle, ages, and, sigismund, aimed, at, securing, that, despite, the, growing, threat, from, the, south, with, the, ottoman, influence, on, the, rise, the, sultan, aimed, at, expanding, the, ottoman, empire, westward, the, ottoman, habsburg, wars, which, lasted, almost, two, centuries, were, also, a, sign, of, the, sultan, s, desire, to, rule, mainland, europe, voivode, gaspar, graziani, ruler, of, moldavia, decided, to, switch, sides, in, favour, of, poland, and, rebelled, against, the, turks, in, turn, sigismund, sent, an, army, to, aid, graziani, a, move, which, sparked, the, polish, ottoman, war, in, 1620, the, polish, forces, were, defeated, at, cecora, and, hetman, kiewski, perished, during, the, battle, in, 1621, a, strong, army, of, ottomans, led, by, osman, ii, advanced, from, edirne, towards, the, polish, frontier, approximately, 160, 000, men, besieged, the, khotyn, fortress, in, september, 1621, but, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, khotyn, by, a, polish, garrison, counting, no, more, than, 50, 000, soldiers, during, the, siege, hetman, jan, karol, chodkiewicz, died, of, exhaustion, and, illness, in, the, camp, the, treaty, of, khotyn, was, signed, on, 9, october, 1621, which, resulted, in, no, territorial, gain, or, loss, but, sigismund, was, to, relinquish, his, claims, on, moldavia, and, the, ottoman, empire, was, prevented, from, marching, into, poland, sultan, osman, himself, was, not, fully, satisfied, with, the, war, s, outcome, and, blamed, the, defiant, janissaries, his, wish, and, plans, to, modernize, the, army, which, was, blamed, for, the, defeat, were, however, opposed, by, the, traditionalist, janissary, units, that, opposition, resulted, in, the, 1622, rebellion, in, which, osman, ii, was, deposed, and, strangled, following, a, series, of, conflicts, between, poland, and, sweden, in, 1600, 1611, 1617, 1618, and, 1621, 1625, all, of, which, ended, in, a, stalemate, gustavus, adolphus, invaded, in, 1626, to, gain, control, over, livonia, and, relinquish, sigismund, s, claim, to, the, swedish, crown, sigismund, already, in, advanced, age, continued, his, long, term, ambition, to, seize, sweden, which, gave, gustavus, adolphus, a, reasonable, casus, belli, and, justification, for, war, though, the, polish, army, achieved, major, victories, in, the, previous, battles, against, sweden, particularly, at, kircholm, in, 1605, the, very, end, proved, to, be, catastrophic, the, first, skirmish, took, place, in, january, 1626, near, wallhof, in, present, day, latvia, where, the, swedish, army, of, 4, 900, men, ambushed, a, polish, force, of, 2, 000, men, commanded, by, jan, stanis, aw, sapieha, son, of, lew, sapieha, polish, casualties, were, estimated, at, between, 500, and, 1, 000, dead, wounded, and, captured, according, to, historians, the, polish, lithuanian, commander, later, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, in, may, 1626, the, swedes, entered, polish, ducal, prussia, escorted, by, a, fleet, a, second, swedish, army, disembarked, in, july, near, the, town, of, pi, awa, pillau, the, landings, were, a, complete, surprise, to, the, commonwealth, s, defences, and, despite, a, relatively, small, swedish, force, gustavus, adolphus, quickly, captured, the, coastal, towns, and, cities, almost, without, a, fight, many, of, these, were, inhabited, by, protestants, who, resisted, the, staunchly, catholic, sigismund, and, polish, domination, of, their, lands, some, towns, opened, their, gates, to, the, protestant, swedish, forces, whom, they, portrayed, as, liberators, however, fortified, gda, sk, danzig, which, maintained, its, own, standing, army, and, a, sizeable, fleet, refused, to, surrender, simultaneously, sigismund, received, little, to, no, support, from, his, vassal, george, william, of, brandenburg, prussia, who, as, a, calvinist, pledged, neutrality, in, the, conflict, j, drzej, moraczewski, described, george, s, neutral, stance, to, salvage, his, dukedom, as, comical, the, poles, attempted, to, divert, the, swedes, from, gda, sk, by, deploying, an, army, to, fight, at, gniew, the, fighting, continued, for, several, days, until, 1, october, when, sigismund, ordered, the, withdrawal, of, his, troops, and, called, on, reinforcements, from, around, the, country, the, battle, despite, a, tactical, victory, for, sweden, was, a, strategic, blow, to, gustavus, who, was, subsequently, unable, to, besiege, gda, sk, at, dirschau, in, the, summer, of, 1627, gustavus, adolphus, was, seriously, wounded, and, the, prussian, campaign, came, to, a, halt, the, wound, forced, the, king, to, stay, in, bed, until, autumn, and, his, right, arm, was, weakened, with, some, fingers, partially, paralyzed, as, the, major, trade, ports, on, the, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, were, blocked, by, swedish, vessels, sigismund, sent, a, small, squadron, of, ten, ships, under, arend, dickmann, to, engage, the, swedes, at, the, battle, of, oliva, it, was, the, largest, naval, battle, fought, by, the, polish, royal, navy, which, successfully, defeated, the, enemy, fleet, and, broke, the, swedish, blockade, although, poland, emerged, victorious, in, the, final, battle, at, trzciana, sigismund, s, exhausted, camp, accepted, a, peace, offer, the, truce, of, altmark, signed, on, 26, september, 1629, 16, september, o, s, granted, sweden, the, control, of, livonia, though, prussia, latgale, and, dyneburg, remained, under, polish, governance, an, unsuccessful, attempt, on, the, life, of, the, king, was, made, on, 15, november, 1620, it, occurred, on, sunday, morning, when, the, monarch, and, his, entourage, was, to, attend, mass, at, st, john, s, archcathedral, in, warsaw, sigismund, was, to, arrive, by, crossing, the, alley, or, passage, that, linked, the, royal, castle, with, the, temple, as, the, royal, procession, drew, closer, to, the, churchdoor, hidden, in, a, nearby, portal, was, petty, nobleman, micha, piekarski, armed, with, a, war, axe, when, the, monarch, reached, the, final, steps, piekarski, leaped, out, and, threw, himself, on, the, king, stabbing, him, twice, firstly, in, the, back, and, then, in, the, cheek, and, striking, him, in, the, arm, however, he, was, not, able, to, deliver, a, fatal, blow, due, to, the, intervention, of, royal, guardsmen, as, well, as, court, marshal, ukasz, opali, ski, who, shielded, the, king, concurrently, prince, ladislaus, wounded, the, assassin, on, the, head, with, a, sabre, other, accounts, state, that, no, guards, were, present, the, cortege, had, a, casual, character, and, the, assassin, was, most, likely, overpowered, by, the, attendees, parishioners, gathered, around, the, pale, and, lifeless, king, who, collapsed, to, the, ground, after, the, incident, the, guards, and, other, attendants, among, them, marcin, szyszkowski, were, able, to, revive, him, and, after, a, medical, examination, the, wounds, were, found, to, be, non, life, threatening, chaos, erupted, when, false, rumours, spread, that, the, king, had, been, murdered, as, his, clothes, were, stained, in, blood, initially, the, townsfolk, believed, that, the, city, was, being, attacked, the, confusion, arose, when, an, italian, priest, s, cry, traditore, traitor, was, misinterpreted, as, tatar, the, assassin, was, widely, regarded, as, a, mentally, unstable, melancholic, unrestrained, in, deeds, piekarski, s, most, probable, cause, for, the, assassination, was, fame, and, recognition, the, successful, assassination, of, henry, iv, in, paris, 1610, by, fran, ois, ravaillac, served, as, motivation, for, his, actions, for, the, appropriate, moment, piekarski, waited, patiently, ten, years, at, his, trial, he, did, not, deny, the, crime, he, committed, and, heavily, insulted, the, monarch, whilst, blaming, himself, for, the, failed, regicide, piekarski, was, executed, in, a, similar, manner, as, ravaillac, on, 27, november, 1620, in, warsaw, he, was, publicly, humiliated, tortured, and, his, body, torn, apart, by, horses, the, dismembered, remains, were, subsequently, burned, and, their, ashes, scattered, by, a, cannon, the, reign, of, sigismund, marked, the, beginning, of, religious, persecution, during, the, counter, reformation, and, the, downfall, of, protestantism, in, poland, lithuania, his, hate, towards, evangelicals, coupled, with, the, advice, of, jesuit, priests, led, to, repressions, and, the, eventual, demise, of, the, polish, brethren, decades, later, their, expulsion, from, poland, in, 1658, contributed, to, the, spread, of, unitarianism, across, the, globe, the, polish, reformed, church, once, a, thriving, institution, and, community, began, to, fall, akin, actions, were, undertaken, against, other, minorities, in, the, country, sigismund, s, contempt, for, eastern, orthodoxy, was, equally, strong, it, was, his, initiative, that, the, native, ruthenian, peoples, inhabiting, the, eastern, lands, of, the, commonwealth, be, forcibly, converted, to, catholicism, which, laid, the, foundation, for, the, modern, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, however, in, sweden, the, policies, had, an, adverse, effect, the, reformation, in, northern, europe, continued, and, anti, catholic, sentiment, strengthened, the, discrimination, further, extended, to, jews, and, muslims, tatars, whose, rights, were, already, restricted, the, warsaw, confederation, of, 1573, granted, religious, freedoms, unlike, elsewhere, in, europe, but, the, degree, to, which, those, freedoms, were, guaranteed, often, varied, in, 1588, sigismund, decreed, that, the, israelites, and, tatars, are, forbidden, by, law, to, hold, public, office, or, assume, political, roles, daily, contact, with, christians, was, to, be, limited, and, any, attempts, made, at, converting, christians, to, judaism, or, islam, was, punishable, by, death, insubordinates, were, burned, at, the, stake, or, in, the, case, of, muslim, men, who, married, christian, women, beheaded, circumcision, of, christian, children, by, jews, was, made, a, capital, offence, however, trade, practices, continued, to, thrive, and, poland, remained, a, safe, haven, for, refugees, fleeing, oppression, in, other, parts, of, the, continent, chiefly, during, the, thirty, years, war, religious, nepotism, under, sigismund, and, in, the, years, following, his, death, was, undoubtedly, apparent, three, of, his, sons, john, casimir, john, albert, and, charles, ferdinand, were, ordained, as, priests, and, held, notable, posts, charles, was, appointed, the, bishop, of, wroc, aw, in, 1625, and, bishop, of, p, ock, in, 1640, john, albert, became, bishop, of, warmia, at, the, age, of, nine, in, 1621, and, cardinal, bishop, of, krak, w, at, the, age, of, twenty, in, 1632, john, casimir, prior, to, his, election, to, the, throne, was, made, a, cardinal, at, the, behest, of, pope, innocent, x, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, sigismund, withdrew, altogether, from, politics, and, devoted, himself, exclusively, to, family, matters, and, his, interests, in, performing, arts, little, is, known, about, the, king, s, wellbeing, at, the, time, suggesting, that, he, was, in, good, health, however, in, his, last, days, he, became, bedridden, due, to, gout, and, joint, pain, an, affliction, which, was, likely, inherited, from, his, grandfather, sigismund, the, old, his, uncle, sigismund, ii, augustus, also, suffered, from, long, term, arthritis, shortly, after, the, unexpected, death, of, his, second, wife, constance, sigismund, fell, dangerously, ill, and, experienced, mental, problems, notably, he, was, struck, with, severe, depression, in, november, 1631, bishop, achacy, grochowski, travelled, to, warsaw, and, wrote, the, monarch, is, of, sound, mind, his, heart, and, stomach, are, healthy, already, in, advanced, age, for, the, period, on, saint, catherine, s, day, 25, november, he, appeared, cheerful, with, a, ruddy, face, and, in, good, spirit, hoped, to, leave, bed, nevertheless, the, gouty, arthritis, progressed, and, medics, applied, red, hot, iron, to, the, painful, swelling, with, no, effect, the, king, sensed, that, death, was, near, and, ordered, an, immediate, assembly, of, nobles, which, convened, on, 1, april, the, so, called, extraordinary, parliament, sejm, ekstraordynaryjny, secured, the, candidacy, and, election, of, his, son, ladislaus, to, the, throne, on, easter, sunday, he, participated, in, final, prayers, whilst, being, supported, by, his, sons, to, prevent, him, from, collapsing, at, eight, in, the, morning, on, 25, april, kasper, doenhoff, a, courtier, in, charge, of, opening, curtains, in, the, royal, bedchamber, and, greeting, the, monarch, did, not, hear, a, response, unable, to, see, at, a, distance, he, approached, sigismund, whose, face, was, paralyzed, from, a, stroke, hours, later, he, briefly, recovered, his, speech, and, murmured, there, is, no, cure, against, the, will, of, death, the, paralysis, worsened, and, on, 27, april, urszula, meyerin, acted, as, spokeswoman, speaking, on, behalf, of, the, mumbling, king, prince, ladislaus, arrived, on, the, same, day, on, 28, april, sigismund, s, bed, was, surrounded, by, his, courtiers, and, the, jesuit, priests, who, performed, exorcism, like, prayers, it, was, his, wish, that, the, court, be, witness, to, his, demise, as, interpreted, in, the, words, vanitas, vanitatis, latin, for, all, is, vanity, after, days, of, suffering, sigismund, passed, away, at, warsaw, s, royal, castle, at, approximately, 2, 45, am, 02, 45, on, 30, april, 1632, his, close, aide, albrycht, s, radziwill, wrote, the, autopsy, on, the, same, day, in, the, afternoon, determined, that, the, king, s, internal,

motifs, a, masterpiece, of, 17th, century, tin, making, the, coffin, was, interred, inside, the, royal, crypt, at, wawel, cathedral, in, krak, w, on, 4, february, 1633, sigismund, s, death, came, at, a, time, of, great, divisions, and, constant, quarrels, his, rule, of, nearly, 45, years, is, perceived, by, some, as, controversial, it, was, distinguished, by, considerable, developments, in, architecture, the, arts, and, culture, coupled, with, conspiracies, religious, antipathy, and, the, endless, conflict, with, sweden, szymon, starowolski, positioned, sigismund, s, legacy, above, that, of, his, predecessors, others, were, less, flattering, the, decision, to, appoint, jesuit, priests, as, ministers, on, matters, which, did, not, necessarily, concern, religion, caused, ubiquitous, disapproval, spiteful, foes, convinced, of, the, damage, he, inflicted, on, the, nation, wrote, with, contempt, this, man, whose, knowledge, exceeded, in, goldsmithing, but, not, politics, lived, far,

take, place, without, incidents, some, threatened, to, abandon, the, royal, court, notably, piotr, skarga, the, marriage, further, fuelled, the, anger, of, sigismund, s, most, vocal, adversaries,
