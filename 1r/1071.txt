amda, seyon, i, also, known, as, amda, tsiyon, i, ge, ez, amda, iy, n, amharic, mde, iy, n, pillar, of, zion, throne, name, gebre, mesqel, g, br, m, s, al, servant, of, the, cross, was, emperor, of, ethiopia, from, 1314, to, 1344, and, a, member, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, he, is, best, known, in, the, so, called, chronicles, as, a, heroic, warrior, against, the, muslims, and, is, sometimes, considered, to, have, been, the, founder, of, the, ethiopian, empire, amda, seyon, s, chronicles, however, appear, to, be, highly, unreliable, as, it, was, written, a, hundred, years, after, his, reign, and, conflates, conflicts, involving, successive, ethiopian, emperors, nonetheless, the, text, state, most, of, his, wars, were, against, the, muslim, sultanates, to, the, southeast, which, he, was, able, to, fight, and, always, defeat, and, substantially, enlarge, his, kingdom, by, gradually, incorporating, a, number, of, neighboring, states, his, supposed, conquests, of, muslim, borderlands, were, said, to, have, greatly, expanded, christian, territory, and, power, in, the, region, which, were, maintained, for, centuries, after, his, death, amda, seyon, asserted, the, strength, of, the, new, solomonic, dynasty, and, therefore, legitimized, it, these, expansions, further, provided, for, the, spread, of, christianity, to, frontier, areas, sparking, a, long, era, of, proselytization, christianization, and, integration, of, previously, peripheral, areas, according, to, british, historian, edward, ullendorff, amda, seyon, was, one, of, the, most, outstanding, ethiopian, kings, of, any, age, and, a, singular, figure, dominating, the, horn, of, africa, in, the, fourteenth, century, it, is, argued, that, sufficient, evidence, shows, that, amda, seyon, was, the, son, of, wedem, arad, however, when, a, deputation, of, monks, led, by, basalota, mika, el, accused, him, of, incest, for, marrying, emperor, wedem, arad, s, concubine, jan, mogassa, and, threatened, to, excommunicate, him, he, claimed, to, be, the, biological, son, of, the, emperor, s, brother, qedma, asgad, this, explanation, may, have, had, its, origins, in, court, gossip, whatever, the, truth, of, amda, seyon, s, parentage, the, imperial, history, known, as, the, paris, chronicle, records, that, he, expressed, his, rage, at, his, accusers, by, beating, one, of, them, abbot, anorewos, of, segaja, and, exiling, the, other, ecclesiastics, to, dembiya, and, begemder, it, is, not, known, how, amda, seyon, became, emperor, however, a, few, pieces, of, information, indicate, that, he, may, have, been, involved, in, the, succession, struggle, against, wedem, arad, taddesse, tamrat, reports, that, he, found, a, contemporary, note, written, in, a, manuscript, now, kept, in, the, island, monastery, of, lake, hayq, which, mentions, that, in, 1309, am, 1316, 7, ad, emperor, amda, seyon, successfully, campaigned, against, the, pagan, damot, as, well, as, muslim, harla, kingdom, and, hadiya, kingdom, the, note, describes, his, conquest, of, damot, many, of, whose, people, he, exiled, to, another, area, and, then, the, conquest, of, hadiya, to, whose, people, he, did, likewise, though, his, early, control, of, these, regions, was, minimal, it, is, evident, by, 1332, or, 1329, that, hadiya, had, been, fully, integrated, providing, troops, for, his, 1332, campaigns, against, the, sultanate, of, ifat, the, king, of, hadiya, amano, refused, to, visit, the, emperor, and, give, his, tribute, encouraged, by, according, to, amda, seyon, s, chronicler, a, muslim, prophet, of, darkness, named, bel, am, according, to, the, emperor, s, chronicle, bel, am, told, him, to, rebel, the, emperor, was, infuriated, invading, hadiya, and, killing, many, people, and, taking, amano, prisoner, along, with, many, of, his, subjects, bel, am, however, was, able, to, escape, the, emperor, by, fleeing, to, ifat, these, conquests, represented, a, significant, advancement, of, amda, seyon, s, eventual, goal, of, controlling, the, inland, trade, previously, controlled, by, the, muslims, in, ifat, and, farther, east, hadiya, s, conquest, deeply, affected, the, slave, trade, and, consequently, hurt, the, trade, and, wealth, of, the, eastern, muslim, provinces, for, the, first, time, the, muslim, presence, in, the, region, was, threatened, which, later, resulted, in, alliances, between, the, muslim, provinces, which, often, rebelled, when, they, had, previously, acted, more, independently, of, each, other, in, the, same, year, as, his, campaigns, against, the, southern, regions, of, damot, and, hadiya, the, emperor, also, campaigned, against, the, more, northerly, province, of, gojjam, after, his, 1316, 7, campaigns, in, the, south, amda, seyon, had, to, turn, north, to, strengthen, his, control, over, areas, that, had, in, the, meanwhile, gained, more, autonomy, the, northern, tigrayan, enderta, province, had, increasingly, been, asserting, its, independence, since, the, solomonic, restoration, under, yekuno, amlak, in, 1270, during, yekuno, amlak, s, time, the, governor, of, enderta, was, ingida, igzi, who, was, succeeded, by, his, son, tesfane, igzi, as, governor, of, enderta, tesfane, igzi, had, the, most, power, among, the, northern, provinces, and, held, the, title, hasgwa, and, aqab, tsentsen, keeper, of, the, fly, whisks, an, ancient, aksumite, title, and, threatened, the, amhara, based, lineage, currently, in, power, as, early, as, 1305, tesfane, igzi, referred, to, enderta, as, his, kingdom, his, son, and, successor, ya, ibika, igzi, did, not, even, mention, the, emperor, in, his, 1318, 9, land, grant, ya, ibika, igzi, eventually, rebelled, unsuccessfully, inviting, the, governor, of, nearby, tembien, to, join, him, amda, seyon, responded, swiftly, killing, the, governor, dividing, the, titles, and, awarding, them, to, different, individuals, of, lowly, origin, the, emperor, s, appointees, were, unpopular, described, as, men, who, were, not, born, from, adam, and, eve, who, were, called, halestiyotat, a, term, literally, meaning, bastard, of, mixed, or, low, origins, to, consolidate, his, control, in, the, region, amda, seyon, established, a, military, colony, of, non, tigrayan, troops, at, amba, senayata, the, center, of, the, rebellion, and, appointed, his, queen, consort, bil, n, saba, as, governor, of, enderta, along, with, a, new, batch, of, officials, below, her, the, queen, ruled, indirectly, however, which, caused, unrest, in, the, province, as, the, population, heavily, resented, amhara, rule, this, induced, the, emperor, to, appoint, one, of, his, sons, bahr, seged, as, governor, who, was, later, in, 1328, also, given, control, of, the, maritime, provinces, under, the, title, of, ma, ikele, bahr, between, the, rivers, seas, in, 1329, the, emperor, campaigned, in, the, northern, provinces, of, semien, wegera, tselemt, and, tsegede, in, which, many, had, been, converting, to, judaism, and, where, the, beta, israel, had, been, gaining, prominence, amda, seyon, was, also, wary, of, muslim, power, along, the, red, sea, coast, and, therefore, headed, to, area, in, modern, eritrea, bordering, the, red, sea, i, king, amd, iyon, went, to, the, sea, of, eritrea, when, i, reached, there, i, mounted, on, an, elephant, and, entered, the, sea, i, took, up, my, arrow, and, spears, killed, my, enemies, and, saved, my, people, during, his, campaign, the, emperor, also, met, the, famous, monk, ewostatewos, who, was, on, his, way, to, armenia, around, 1320, sultan, an, nasir, muhammad, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, based, in, cairo, began, persecuting, copts, and, destroying, their, churches, amd, seyon, subsequently, sent, a, mission, to, cairo, in, 1321, 2, threatening, to, retaliate, against, the, muslims, in, his, kingdom, and, threatened, to, send, a, legion, in, conquest, of, egypt, after, diverting, the, course, of, the, nile, if, the, sultan, did, not, end, his, persecution, though, al, nasir, muhammad, ignored, the, envoys, fear, of, the, diversion, of, the, nile, in, egypt, would, continue, for, centuries, as, a, result, of, the, dispute, and, threats, haqq, ad, din, i, sultan, of, ifat, seized, and, imprisoned, a, member, of, the, deputation, sent, by, the, emperor, named, ti, yintay, on, his, way, back, from, cairo, haqq, ad, din, tried, to, convert, ti, yintay, killing, him, when, this, failed, the, emperor, responded, by, invading, ifat, accompanied, by, according, to, amda, seyon, s, royal, chronicler, only, seven, horsemen, and, killed, many, of, the, sultan, s, soldiers, part, of, the, army, then, followed, him, and, destroyed, the, province, s, capital, ifat, and, amda, seyon, took, much, of, its, wealth, in, the, form, of, gold, silver, bronze, lead, and, clothing, amda, seyon, continued, his, reprisals, throughout, all, of, the, provinces, of, ifat, pillaging, kwelgora, biqulzar, gidaya, hubat, fedis, qeds, hargaya, and, shewa, populated, mainly, by, muslims, taking, livestock, killing, many, inhabitants, destroying, towns, and, mosques, as, well, as, taking, prisoners, as, a, result, of, amda, seyon, s, reprisals, other, muslim, states, tried, to, attack, his, army, seeing, that, his, army, had, become, weak, from, the, long, campaigns, the, people, of, gebel, and, wargar, who, historian, taddesse, tamrat, associates, with, warjih, were, reportedly, very, skilled, in, warfare, subsequently, attacked, and, pillaged, some, christian, regions, the, people, of, medra, zega, and, manzih, menz, then, muslims, also, surrounded, and, attacked, the, emperor, s, army, who, defeated, them, and, killed, their, commander, dedadir, a, son, of, haqq, ad, din, the, most, important, primary, source, for, his, reign, the, glorious, victories, describes, the, extensive, military, campaigns, amda, seyon, undertook, in, the, plains, drained, by, the, awash, river, beginning, on, 24, yakatit, 18, february, the, emperor, led, his, army, against, a, number, of, enemies, another, document, referring, to, this, year, states, that, he, defeated, 10, kings, rebellion, in, the, muslim, provinces, stemmed, from, the, threat, to, islam, by, amda, seyon, magnified, by, the, earlier, loss, of, trade, from, his, campaigns, this, defiance, was, encouraged, and, perhaps, even, instigated, by, religious, leaders, in, ifat, and, other, muslim, provinces, the, false, prophet, reported, as, having, fled, from, hadiya, during, the, 1316, 7, campaigns, continued, spreading, propaganda, against, the, king, in, ifat, where, he, was, one, of, sabr, ad, din, s, advisors, the, chronicle, states, the, false, prophet, fled, to, the, land, of, ifat, and, lived, there, propagating, his, false, teaching, and, when, s, br, d, n, asked, him, for, council, he, told, him, saying, the, kingdom, of, the, christians, has, now, come, to, an, end, and, it, has, been, given, to, us, for, you, will, reign, on, in, siyon, go, ascend, and, fight, the, king, of, the, christians, you, will, defeat, him, and, rule, him, together, with, his, peoples, a, second, religious, leader, is, noted, as, having, fomented, trouble, in, the, region, specifically, in, adal, and, mora, he, is, called, salih, whose, title, was, qaz, which, it, notes, is, a, title, similar, to, an, archbishop, and, is, described, as, being, revered, and, feared, like, god, by, the, kings, and, rulers, in, the, region, the, chronicle, ascribes, blame, to, sal, h, stating, that, it, was, he, who, gathered, the, muslim, troops, kings, and, rulers, against, the, emperor, as, a, result, of, these, instigations, and, conditions, sabr, ad, din, i, governor, of, ifat, as, well, as, brother, and, successor, to, haqq, ad, din, showed, defiance, to, amda, seyon, by, confiscating, some, of, the, emperor, s, goods, in, transit, from, the, coast, i, e, zeila, similar, to, what, his, brother, had, done, before, him, amda, seyon, was, furious, with, sabr, ad, din, saying, to, him, you, took, away, the, commodities, belonging, to, me, obtained, in, exchange, for, the, large, quantity, of, gold, and, silver, i, had, entrusted, to, the, merchants, you, imprisoned, the, traders, who, did, business, for, me, sabr, ad, din, s, rebellion, was, not, an, attempt, to, achieve, independence, but, to, become, emperor, of, a, muslim, ethiopia, amda, seyon, s, royal, chronicle, states, that, sabr, ad, din, proclaimed, in, fact, after, his, first, incursion, sabr, ad, din, appointed, governors, for, nearby, and, neighboring, provinces, such, as, fatagar, and, alamal, i, e, aymellel, part, of, the, gurag, country, as, well, as, far, off, provinces, in, the, north, like, damot, amhara, angot, inderta, begemder, and, gojjam, he, also, threatened, to, plant, khat, at, the, capital, a, stimulant, used, by, muslims, but, forbidden, to, ethiopian, orthodox, christians, sabr, ad, din, s, rebellion, with, its, religious, support, and, ambitious, goals, was, therefore, seen, as, a, jihad, rather, than, an, attempt, at, independence, and, it, was, consequently, immediately, joined, by, the, nearby, muslim, province, of, dewaro, the, first, known, mention, of, the, province, under, the, governor, haydera, and, the, western, province, of, hadiya, under, the, vassal, local, ruler, ameno, sabr, ad, din, divided, his, troops, into, three, parts, sending, a, division, north, westwards, to, attack, amhara, one, northwards, to, attack, angot, and, another, under, his, personal, command, westward, to, take, shewa, amda, seyon, subsequently, mobilized, his, soldiers, to, meet, the, threat, endowing, them, with, gifts, of, gold, silver, and, lavish, clothing, so, much, so, that, the, chronicler, explains, that, in, his, reign, gold, and, silver, abounded, like, stones, and, fine, clothes, were, as, common, as, the, leaves, of, the, trees, or, the, grass, in, the, fields, despite, the, extravagance, he, bestowed, on, his, men, many, chose, not, to, fight, due, to, the, inhospitability, of, ifat, s, mountainous, and, arid, terrain, and, the, complete, absence, of, roads, nevertheless, they, advanced, on, 24, yakatit, and, an, attachment, was, able, to, find, the, rebellious, governor, and, put, him, to, flight, once, the, remainder, of, amda, seyon, s, army, arrived, they, destroyed, the, capital, and, killed, many, soldiers, but, sabr, ad, din, once, again, escaped, amda, seyon, s, forces, then, grouped, together, for, a, final, attack, destroying, one, of, his, camps, killing, many, men, women, and, children, taking, the, rest, prisoner, as, well, as, looting, it, of, its, gold, silver, and, its, fine, clothes, and, jewels, without, number, sabr, ad, din, subsequently, sued, for, peace, appealing, to, queen, jan, mengesha, who, refused, his, peace, offer, and, expressed, amda, seyon, s, determination, not, to, return, to, his, capital, until, he, had, searched, sabr, ad, din, out, upon, hearing, this, sabr, ad, din, realized, that, his, rebellion, futile, and, surrendered, himself, to, amda, seyon, s, camp, amda, seyon, s, courtiers, demanded, that, sabr, ad, din, be, executed, but, he, instead, granted, him, relative, clemency, and, had, the, rebellious, governor, imprisoned, amda, seyon, then, appointed, the, governor, s, brother, jamal, ad, din, i, as, his, successor, in, ifat, just, as, the, ifat, rebellion, had, been, quelled, however, the, neighboring, provinces, of, adal, and, mora, just, north, of, ifat, rose, against, the, emperor, amda, seyon, soon, also, put, down, this, rebellion, after, much, campaigning, amda, seyon, s, troops, were, exhausted, and, wished, to, return, to, their, homes, pleading, that, the, rainy, season, was, soon, approaching, amda, seyon, refused, however, saying, to, them, the, new, governor, of, ifat, also, beseeched, him, to, return, giving, him, many, gifts, stating, that, his, country, was, ruined, and, begging, him, not, to, ravage, it, again, so, that, its, inhabitants, may, recover, and, work, the, land, for, the, emperor, he, promised, him, that, if, he, left, that, ifat, and, its, inhabitants, would, serve, the, emperor, with, their, trade, and, tribute, and, that, he, and, the, muslims, of, ethiopia, were, the, emperor, s, servants, amda, seyon, rejected, the, governor, s, pleas, declaring, amda, seyon, continued, and, was, attacked, twice, in, skirmishes, before, making, camp, the, muslims, returned, during, the, night, in, much, greater, numbers, and, attacked, him, with, an, army, raised, from, the, seven, great, clans, of, adal, gebela, lebekela, wargar, paguma, and, tiqo, during, the, battle, amda, seyon, was, struck, from, the, rear, by, an, enemy, s, sword, cutting, his, girdle, around, his, waist, and, his, battle, dress, but, the, emperor, was, able, to, turn, and, kill, the, attacker, with, his, spear, before, he, could, strike, again, according, to, james, bruce, the, imperial, army, had, been, infiltrated, by, foreign, agents, from, harar, however, amda, seyon, s, men, were, able, to, apprehend, and, execute, them, amda, seyon, emerged, victorious, from, the, battle, and, sent, fresh, troops, who, had, not, fought, to, pursue, the, surviving, enemies, they, were, able, to, reach, the, survivors, on, the, banks, of, a, nearby, river, by, morning, and, kill, them, taking, many, swords, bows, spears, and, clothes, jamal, ad, din, despite, being, his, appointee, also, joined, the, rebellion, collaborating, with, the, ruler, of, adal, imam, salih, to, encircle, the, emperor, to, which, the, ruler, of, adal, responded, by, mobilizing, his, forces, the, ethiopian, army, was, encircled, by, the, two, armies, in, the, battle, of, das, but, amda, seyon, was, able, to, defeat, them, despite, being, ill, he, then, led, his, army, against, talag, the, capital, of, adal, where, the, brother, of, the, governor, of, adal, and, three, of, the, governor, s, sons, surrendered, the, emperor, then, defeated, another, governor, king, retraced, his, steps, returning, to, bequlzar, in, ifat, where, he, commanded, jamal, ad, din, to, deliver, him, all, of, the, province, s, apostate, christians, the, emperor, was, first, given, the, priests, deacons, and, soldiers, who, were, each, given, 30, lashes, and, imprisoned, as, slaves, he, then, turned, to, the, other, traitors, whom, jamal, ad, din, refused, to, hand, over, amda, seyon, again, ravaged, ifat, and, deposed, jamal, ad, din, appointing, nasir, ad, din, another, brother, of, sabr, ad, din, as, governor, having, finished, campaigning, in, ifat, he, took, his, army, to, the, town, of, gu, t, where, he, killed, many, men, and, captured, numerous, women, and, cattle, the, emperor, then, invaded, the, region, of, modern, somaliland, where, he, defeated, an, attack, by, the, people, of, harla, amda, seyon, then, advanced, to, the, town, of, dilhoya, the, town, had, previously, deposed, his, governor, by, immolation, along, with, other, christian, men, and, women, to, which, the, emperor, responded, by, taking, and, looting, the, town, and, their, livestock, as, well, as, killing, many, of, its, inhabitants, amda, seyon, then, continued, to, degwi, killing, numerous, neighboring, warjih, pastoralists, who, had, previously, attacked, and, pillaged, some, christian, areas, earlier, in, his, reign, the, chronicle, described, the, people, as, very, wicked, as, they, neither, knew, god, nor, feared, men, before, the, end, of, the, month, of, december, amda, seyon, ravaged, the, land, of, sharkha, and, imprisoned, its, governor, yoseph, these, efforts, extended, ethiopian, rule, for, the, first, time, across, the, awash, river, gaining, control, of, dawaro, bale, and, other, muslim, states, at, the, close, of, this, campaign, the, chronicles, states, that, amda, seyon, would, eventually, return, to, the, highlands, never, again, to, set, foot, in, the, muslim, territories, which, the, chronicler, claims, was, unprecedented, in, the, country, s, history, he, is, famous, for, never, losing, a, battle, his, tomb, is, believed, to, be, in, adi, qelebes, two, different, years, have, been, offered, for, when, these, extensive, military, actions, occurred, is, disputed, in, his, translation, of, the, glorious, victories, g, w, b, huntingford, follows, james, bruce, in, placing, this, in, 1329, huntingford, notes, that, amda, seyon, is, recorded, as, celebrating, easter, on, 28, miyazya, 24, april, in, 1329, which, would, best, fit, that, year, however, the, generally, accepted, year, for, this, campaign, is, 1332, which, is, the, opinion, of, such, authorities, as, august, dillmann, carlo, conti, rossini, and, enrico, cerulli, taddesse, tamrat, points, to, another, document, which, dates, amda, seyon, s, 18th, regnal, year, to, 498, year, of, grace, which, confirms, that, the, year, 516, in, the, glorious, victories, is, correct, and, that, the, campaigns, took, place, in, ad, 1332, emperor, amda, seyon, s, army, was, remarkably, similar, to, the, organization, of, the, army, during, ancient, aksumite, times, it, consisted, of, two, parts, the, first, his, central, army, was, very, effective, and, closely, attached, to, the, royal, court, the, second, was, a, much, larger, local, militia, raised, in, times, of, local, crises, these, local, units, would, as, in, aksumite, times, form, a, distinctive, unit, and, fight, together, maintaining, their, local, character, and, were, divided, into, smaller, units, each, headed, by, a, local, ruler, from, the, reign, of, amde, tseyon, chewa, regiments, or, legions, formed, the, backbone, of, the, empire, military, forces, the, ge, ez, term, for, these, regiments, is, ewa, while, the, amharic, term, is, wa, the, normal, size, of, a, regiment, was, several, thousand, men, each, regiment, was, allocated, a, fief, gult, to, ensure, its, upkeep, ensured, by, the, land, revenue, the, central, army, was, divided, into, independent, regiments, each, with, its, own, specialized, name, such, as, qeste, nihb, hareb, gonda, and, tekula, the, independent, regiments, competed, for, the, king, s, favor, who, raised, and, nourished, them, from, childhood, the, regiments, were, led, by, an, intimately, loyal, commander, directly, responsible, to, amda, seyon, his, own, son, saf, asegid, commanded, one, of, these, divisions, as, did, amda, seyon, s, brother, in, law, moreover, the, commander, of, qeste, nihb, simishehal, along, with, his, colleague, inze, aygeb, were, described, as, the, most, beloved, officers, of, the, emperor, who, was, distressed, when, he, learned, of, their, injury, at, the, battle, of, hagera, the, specialized, regiments, tied, their, fortune, to, that, of, the, emperor, and, were, most, likely, taken, from, the, best, soldiers, from, around, the, country, amda, seyon, used, them, whenever, quick, action, had, to, be, taken, and, their, regiment, commanders, would, often, serve, the, role, of, governor, in, times, of, crises, in, certain, provinces, as, did, digna, the, right, wing, commander, of, the, cavalry, regiment, korem, named, after, the, region, town, of, the, same, name, in, 1332, then, part, of, angot, in, bete, amhara, his, central, army, further, consisted, of, regional, regiments, similar, to, those, of, his, local, militias, they, were, drawn, mainly, from, newly, conquered, provinces, and, shared, a, cultural, and, linguistic, heritage, most, soldiers, were, probably, prisoners, taken, in, the, conquests, though, some, were, undoubtedly, kept, as, servants, to, the, royal, court, while, others, were, exported, to, slave, markets, or, given, to, private, citizens, those, who, were, to, serve, the, emperor, were, given, military, training, probably, under, a, commander, from, the, same, region, and, loyal, to, the, emperor, most, of, these, groups, were, broken, down, into, smaller, sections, due, to, their, size, for, instance, in, amda, seyon, s, 1332, or, 1329, campaigns, a, division, of, damot, fought, the, beta, israel, in, the, north, while, another, went, to, fight, in, the, campaigns, in, the, south, against, the, sultanate, of, ifat, the, emperor, improved, the, imperial, army, which, until, his, reign, was, not, as, heavily, armed, as, his, muslim,
