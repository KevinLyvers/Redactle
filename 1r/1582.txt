party, of, germany, s, women, s, section, she, met, clara, zetkin, whom, she, made, a, lifelong, friend, between, 1907, and, his, conscription, in, 1915, she, was, involved, in, a, love, affair, with, clara, s, younger, son, kostja, zetkin, to, which, approximately, 600, surviving, letters, now, mostly, published, bear, testimony, luxemburg, was, a, member, of, the, uncompromising, left, wing, of, the, spd, their, clear, position, was, that, the, objectives, of, liberation, for, the, industrial, working, class, and, all, minorities, could, be, achieved, by, revolution, only, as, irene, gammel, writes, in, a, review, of, the, english, translation, of, the, book, in, the, globe, and, mail, the, three, decades, covered, by, the, 230, letters, in, this, collection, provide, the, context, for, her, major, contributions, as, a, political, activist, socialist, theorist, and, writer, her, reputation, was, tarnished, by, joseph, stalin, s, cynicism, in, questions, concerning, the, history, of, bolshevism, in, his, rewriting, of, russian, events, he, placed, the, blame, for, the, theory, of, permanent, revolution, on, luxemburg, s, shoulders, with, faint, praise, for, her, attacks, on, karl, kautsky, which, she, commenced, in, 1910, according, to, gammel, in, her, controversial, tome, of, 1913, the, accumulation, of, capital, as, well, as, through, her, work, as, a, co, founder, of, the, radical, spartacus, league, luxemburg, helped, to, shape, germany, s, young, democracy, by, advancing, an, international, rather, than, a, nationalist, outlook, this, farsightedness, partly, explains, her, remarkable, popularity, as, a, socialist, icon, and, its, continued, resonance, in, movies, novels, and, memorials, dedicated, to, her, life, and, oeuvre, gammel, also, notes, that, for, luxemburg, the, revolution, was, a, way, of, life, and, yet, that, the, letters, also, challenge, the, stereotype, of, red, rosa, as, a, ruthless, fighter, however, the, accumulation, of, capital, sparked, angry, accusations, from, the, communist, party, of, germany, in, 1923, ruth, fischer, and, arkadi, maslow, denounced, the, work, as, errors, a, derivative, work, of, economic, miscalculation, known, as, spontaneity, luxemburg, continued, to, identify, as, polish, and, disliked, living, in, germany, which, she, saw, as, a, political, necessity, making, various, negative, comments, about, german, culture, during, the, german, empire, in, her, private, correspondence, that, was, written, in, polish, at, the, same, time, she, loved, the, works, of, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, and, showed, an, appreciation, for, german, literature, however, she, also, preferred, switzerland, to, berlin, and, greatly, missed, polish, language, and, culture, when, luxemburg, moved, to, germany, in, may, 1898, she, settled, in, berlin, she, was, active, there, in, the, left, wing, of, the, spd, in, which, she, sharply, defined, the, border, between, the, views, of, her, faction, and, the, revisionism, theory, of, eduard, bernstein, she, attacked, him, in, her, brochure, social, reform, or, revolution, released, in, september, 1898, luxemburg, s, rhetorical, skill, made, her, a, leading, spokesperson, in, denouncing, the, spd, s, reformist, parliamentary, course, she, argued, that, the, critical, difference, between, capital, and, labour, could, only, be, countered, if, the, proletariat, assumed, power, and, effected, revolutionary, changes, in, methods, of, production, she, wanted, the, revisionists, ousted, from, the, spd, that, did, not, occur, but, kautsky, s, leadership, retained, a, marxist, influence, on, its, programme, from, 1900, luxemburg, published, analyses, of, contemporary, european, socio, economic, problems, in, newspapers, foreseeing, war, she, vigorously, attacked, what, she, saw, as, german, militarism, and, imperialism, luxemburg, wanted, a, general, strike, to, rouse, the, workers, to, solidarity, and, prevent, the, coming, war, however, the, spd, leaders, refused, and, she, broke, with, kautsky, in, 1910, between, 1904, and, 1906, she, was, imprisoned, for, her, political, activities, on, three, occasions, in, barnimstrasse, women, s, prison, in, 1907, she, went, to, the, russian, social, democrats, fifth, party, day, in, london, where, she, met, lenin, at, the, socialist, second, international, congress, in, stuttgart, her, resolution, demanding, that, all, european, workers, parties, should, unite, in, attempting, to, stop, the, war, was, accepted, luxemburg, taught, marxism, and, economics, at, the, spd, s, berlin, training, centre, her, former, student, friedrich, ebert, became, the, spd, leader, and, later, the, weimar, republic, s, first, president, in, 1912, luxemburg, was, the, spd, representative, at, the, european, socialists, congresses, with, french, socialist, jean, jaur, s, luxemburg, argued, that, european, workers, parties, should, organise, a, general, strike, when, war, broke, out, in, 1913, she, told, a, large, meeting, if, they, think, we, are, going, to, lift, the, weapons, of, murder, against, our, french, and, other, brethren, then, we, shall, shout, we, will, not, do, it, however, when, nationalist, crises, in, the, balkans, erupted, into, violence, and, then, the, war, in, 1914, there, was, no, general, strike, and, the, spd, majority, supported, the, war, as, did, the, french, socialists, the, reichstag, unanimously, agreed, to, finance, the, war, the, spd, voted, in, favour, of, that, and, agreed, to, a, truce, burgfrieden, with, the, imperial, government, and, promised, that, spd, controlled, labour, unions, would, refrain, from, strike, action, for, the, duration, of, the, war, this, led, luxemburg, to, contemplate, suicide, as, the, revisionism, she, had, fought, since, 1899, had, triumphed, in, response, luxemburg, organised, anti, war, demonstrations, in, frankfurt, calling, for, conscientious, objection, to, military, conscription, and, the,

party, on, 31, december, 1918, the, progress, of, large, scale, capitalist, development, during, seventy, years, has, brought, us, so, far, that, today, we, can, seriously, set, about, destroying, capitalism, once, and, for, all, no, still, more, today, we, are, not, only, in, a, position, to, perform, this, task, its, performance, is, not, only, a, duty, toward, the, proletariat, but, its, solution, offers, the, only, means, of, saving, human, society, from, destruction, like, liebknecht, luxemburg, supported, the, violent, putsch, attempt, in, a, complete, reversal, of, her, previous,

february, radek, went, into, hiding, luxemburg, s, last, known, words, written, on, the, evening, of, her, execution, were, about, her, belief, in, the, masses, and, what, she, saw, as, the, inevitability, of, a, triumphant, revolution, the, contradiction, between, the, powerful, decisive, aggressive, offensive, of, the, berlin, masses, on, the, one, hand, and, the, indecisive, half, hearted, vacillation, of, the, berlin, leadership, on, the, other, is, the, mark, of, this, latest, episode, the, leadership, failed, but, a, new, leadership, can, and, must, be, created, by, the,

challenge, and, out, of, this, defeat, they, have, forged, a, link, in, the, chain, of, historic, defeats, which, is, the, pride, and, strength, of, international, socialism, that, is, why, future, victories, will, spring, from, this, defeat, order, prevails, in, berlin, you, foolish, lackeys, your, order, is, built, on, sand, tomorrow, the, revolution, will, rise, up, again, clashing, its,

paramilitary, warfare, in, berlin, and, across, germany, thousands, of, members, of, the, kpd, as, well, as, other, revolutionaries, and, civilians, were, killed, often, as, collateral, damage, finally, the, people, s, navy, division, volksmarinedivision, and, workers, and, soldiers, unions, which, had, moved, to, the, political, far, left, were, disbanded, the, last, part, of, the, german,

chancellor, ebert, had, both, covertly, approved, of, his, actions, but, his, account, has, not, been, confirmed, nor, has, his, case, been, examined, by, the, parliament, or, courts, of, germany, in, 1993, gietinger, s, research, on, his, access, to, the, previously, restricted, papers, of, pabst, held, at, the, federal, military, archives, found, him, as, central, to, the, planning, of, the, murder, of, luxemburg, and, the, shielding, of, those, who, had, acted, under, his, orders, from, subsequent, criminal, prosecution, shortly, after, luxemburg, s, death, her, fame, was, alluded, to, by, grigory, zinoviev, at, the, petrograd, soviet, on, 18, january, 1919, supporting, her, assessment, of, bolshevism, lenin, posthumously, praised, luxemburg, as, an, eagle, of, the, working, class, and, stated, that, her, work, would, serve, as, an, example, to, other, socialist, revolutionaries, russian, revolutionary, leon, trotsky, also, publicly, mourned, luxemburg, s, and, liebknecht, s, death, in, later, years, trotsky, frequently, defended, luxemburg, claiming, that, joseph, stalin, had, vilified, her, in, the, article, hands, off, rosa, luxemburg, trotsky, criticised, stalin, for, this, despite, what, trotsky, perceived, as, luxemburg, s, theoretical, errors, writing, yes, stalin, has, sufficient, cause, to, hate, rosa, luxemburg, but, all, the, more, imperious, therefore, becomes, our, duty, to, shield, rosa, s, memory, from, stalin, s, calumny, that, has, been, caught, by, the, hired, functionaries, of, both, hemispheres, and, to, pass, on, this, truly, beautiful, heroic, and, tragic, image, to, the, young, generations, of, the, proletariat, in, all, its, grandeur, and, inspirational, force, in, the, city, of, berlin, a, liebknecht, luxemburg, demonstration, shortened, to, ll, demo, is, organised, annually, in, the, month, of, january, around, the, date, of, their, death, this, demonstration, takes, place, on, the, second, weekend, of, the, month, in, berlin, friedrichshain, starting, near, the, frankfurter, tor, and, then, to, their, graves, in, the, central, cemetery, friedrichsfelde, also, known, as, the, gedenkst, tte, der, sozialisten, socialist, memorial, in, east, germany, the, event, was, widely, considered, to, be, a, mere, show, for, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, politicians, and, celebrities, which, was, broadcast, live, on, state, television, during, the, peaceful, revolution, the, annual, parade, in, east, berlin, honoring, the, deaths, of, liebknecht, and, luxemburg, was, used, by, east, german, dissidents, as, part, of, their, campaign, to, raise, their, unwelcome, demands, at, embarrassing, moments, for, the, regime, on, 17, january, 1988, as, premier, erich, honecker, was, reviewing, the, parade, a, group, of, dissidents, broke, through, the, ranks, of, the, free, german, youth, and, unfurled, banners, bearing, an, infamous, dictum, from, die, russische, revolution, rosa, luxemburg, s, book, length, denunciation, of, both, authoritarian, socialism, and, censorship, in, the, soviet, union, freiheit, ist, immer, freiheit, der, andersdenkenden, freedom, is, always, the, freedom, of, dissenters, viewers, of, the, parade, were, then, subjected, to, the, ironic, sight, of, east, german, stasi, agents, beating, and, arresting, anyone, who, brandished, the, slogan, in, january, 2019, the, german, left, wing, parties, commemorated, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, summary, execution, of, luxemburg, and, liebknecht, luxemburg, initially, professed, a, commitment, to, democracy, and, the, necessity, of, revolution, luxemburg, s, idea, of, democracy, which, stanley, aronowitz, calls, generalized, democracy, in, an, unarticulated, form, represents, luxemburg, s, greatest, break, with, mainstream, communism, since, it, effectively, diminishes, the, role, of, the, communist, party, but, it, similar, to, the, views, of, karl, marx, states, that, the, working, class, must, emancipate, themselves, without, a, higher, authority, early, on, luxemburg, attacked, the, totalitarian, tendencies, present, in, the, russian, revolution, claiming, that, without, democratic, institutions, and, protections, life, dies, out, in, every, public, institution, and, further, claimed, that, such, a, lack, of, freedoms, would, lead, to, a, dictatorship, of, a, handful, of, politicians, freedom, only, for, the, supporters, of, the, government, only, for, the, members, of, one, party, however, numerous, they, may, be, is, no, freedom, at, all, freedom, is, always, and, exclusively, freedom, for, the, one, who, thinks, differently, not, because, of, any, fanatical, concept, of, justice, but, because, all, that, is, instructive, wholesome, and, purifying, in, political, freedom, depends, on, this, essential, characteristic, and, its, effectiveness, vanishes, when, freedom, becomes, a, special, privilege, but, socialist, democracy, is, not, something, which, begins, only, in, the, promised, land, after, the, foundations, of, socialist, economy, are, created, it, does, not, come, as, some, sort, of, christmas, present, for, the, worthy, people, who, in, the, interim, have, loyally, supported, a, handful, of, socialist, dictators, socialist, democracy, begins, simultaneously, with, the, beginnings, of, the, destruction, of, class, rule, and, of, the, construction, of, socialism, in, an, article, published, just, before, the, october, revolution, luxemburg, characterised, the, russian, february, revolution, of, 1917, as, a, revolution, of, the, proletariat, and, said, that, the, liberal, bourgeoisie, were, pushed, to, movement, by, the, display, of, proletarian, power, the, task, of, the, russian, proletariat, she, explained, was, now, to, end, the, imperialist, world, war, in, addition, to, struggling, against, the, imperialist, bourgeoisie, the, world, war, made, russia, ripe, for, a, socialist, revolution, therefore, the, german, proletariat, are, also, posed, a, question, of, honour, and, a, very, fateful, question, however, in, several, works, including, an, essay, written, from, jail, and, published, posthumously, by, her, last, companion, paul, levi, publication, of, which, precipitated, his, expulsion, from, the, third, international, titled, the, russian, revolution, luxemburg, sharply, criticised, some, bolshevik, policies, such, as, their, suppression, of, the, constituent, assembly, in, january, 1918, following, the, october, revolution, and, their, policy, of, supporting, the, purported, right, of, all, national, peoples, to, self, determination, according, to, luxemburg, the, bolsheviks, strategic, mistakes, created, tremendous, dangers, for, the, revolution, such, as, its, bureaucratisation, she, wrote, that, the, shortcomings, of, the, october, revolution, reflected, a, period, of, complete, failure, of, the, international, proletariat, luxemburg, further, stated, the, awkward, position, that, the, bolsheviks, are, in, today, however, is, together, with, most, of, their, mistakes, a, consequence, of, basic, insolubility, of, the, problem, posed, to, them, by, the, international, above, all, the, german, proletariat, to, carry, out, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, and, a, socialist, revolution, in, a, single, country, surrounded, by, reactionary, imperialist, rule, and, in, the, fury, of, the, bloodiest, world, war, in, human, history, that, is, squaring, the, circle, any, socialist, party, would, have, to, fail, in, this, task, and, perish, whether, or, not, it, made, self, renunciation, the, guiding, star, of, its, policies, bolshevik, theorists, such, as, lenin, and, trotsky, responded, to, this, criticism, by, arguing, that, luxemburg, s, notions, were, classical, marxist, ones, but, they, could, not, be, applied, to, russia, of, 1917, they, stated, that, the, lessons, of, actual, experience, such, as, the, confrontation, with, the, bourgeois, parties, had, forced, them, to, revise, the, marxian, strategy, as, part, of, this, argument, it, was, pointed, out, that, after, luxemburg, herself, got, out, of, jail, she, was, also, forced, to, confront, the, national, assembly, in, germany, a, step, they, compared, with, their, own, conflict, with, the, russian, constituent, assembly, following, her, observation, of, the, october, revolution, luxemburg, claimed, that, it, was, the, historic, responsibility, of, the, german, workers, to, carry, out, a, revolution, for, themselves, and, thereby, end, the, war, when, the, german, revolution, began, luxemburg, immediately, started, to, agitate, for, a, social, revolution, which, she, claimed, would, mitigate, the, consequences, of, the, bolshevik, revolution, according, to, aronowitz, the, vagueness, of, luxemburgian, democracy, is, one, reason, for, its, initial, difficulty, in, gaining, widespread, support, luxemburg, herself, clarified, her, position, on, democracy, in, her, writings, regarding, the, russian, revolution, and, the, soviet, union, the, accumulation, of, capital, was, the, only, work, luxemburg, officially, published, on, economics, during, her, lifetime, in, the, polemic, she, argued, that, capitalism, needs, to, constantly, expand, into, non, capitalist, areas, in, order, to, access, new, supply, sources, markets, for, surplus, value, and, reservoirs, of, labour, according, to, luxemburg, marx, had, made, an, error, in, das, kapital, in, that, the, proletariat, could, not, afford, to, buy, the, commodities, they, produced, and, by, his, own, criteria, it, was, impossible, for, capitalists, to, make, a, profit, in, a, closed, capitalist, system, since, the, demand, for, commodities, would, be, too, low, and, therefore, much, of, the, value, of, commodities, could, not, be, transformed, into, money, according, to, luxemburg, capitalists, sought, to, realise, profits, through, offloading, surplus, commodities, onto, non, capitalist, economies, hence, the, phenomenon, of, imperialism, as, capitalist, states, sought, to, dominate, weaker, economies, however, this, was, leading, to, the, destruction, of, non, capitalist, economies, as, they, were, increasingly, absorbed, into, the, capitalist, system, with, the, destruction, of, non, capitalist, economies, there, would, be, no, more, markets, to, offload, surplus, commodities, onto, and, capitalism, would, break, down, the, accumulation, of, capital, was, harshly, criticised, by, both, marxist, and, non, marxist, economists, on, the, grounds, that, her, logic, was, circular, in, proclaiming, the, impossibility, of, realising, profits, in, a, close, capitalist, system, and, that, her, underconsumptionist, theory, was, too, crude, her, conclusion, that, the, limits, of, the, capitalist, system, drive, it, to, imperialism, and, war, led, luxemburg, to, a, lifetime, of, campaigning, against, militarism, and, colonialism, the, dialectic, of, spontaneity, and, organisation, was, the, central, feature, of, luxemburg, s, political, philosophy, wherein, spontaneity, is, a, grassroots, approach, to, organising, a, class, struggle, and, organisation, is, a, top, down, or, vanguardist, approach, to, organising, a, class, struggle, she, argued, that, spontaneity, and, organisation, are, not, separable, or, separate, activities, but, different, moments, of, one, political, process, as, one, does, not, exist, without, the, other, these, beliefs, arose, from, her, view, that, class, struggle, evolves, from, an, elementary, spontaneous, state, to, a, democratic, organisation, luxemburg, developed, the, dialectic, of, spontaneity, and, organisation, under, the, influence, of, mass, strikes, in, europe, especially, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, unlike, the, social, democratic, orthodoxy, of, the, second, international, she, regarded, the, organisation, of, a, socialist, movement, as, a, temporary, means, to, worker, enlightenment, social, democracy, is, simply, the, embodiment, of, the, modern, proletariat, s, class, struggle, a, struggle, which, is, driven, by, a, consciousness, of, its, own, historic, consequences, the, masses, are, in, reality, their, own, leaders, dialectically, creating, their, own, development, process, the, more, that, social, democracy, develops, grows, and, becomes, stronger, the, more, the, enlightened, masses, of, workers, will, take, their, own, destinies, the, leadership, of, their, movement, and, the, determination, of, its, direction, into, their, own, hands, she, insisted, on, setting, the, class, struggle, in, its, historical, context, writing, the, modern, proletarian, class, does, not, carry, out, its, struggle, according, to, a, plan, set, out, in, some, book, or, theory, the, modern, workers, struggle, is, a, part, of, history, a, part, of, social, progress, in, spite, of, her, own, polish, nationality, and, strong, ties, to, polish, culture, her, opposition, to, the, independence, of, the, second, polish, republic, and, later, criticism, from, stalinists, have, made, her, a, controversial, historical, figure, in, the, modern, third, polish, republic, s, political, discourse, during, the, polish, people, s, republic, a, manufacturing, facility, of, electric, lamps, in, the, wola, district, of, warsaw, polish, capital, and, the, place, where,

her, memory, have, taken, place, in, a, number, of, polish, cities, such, as, pozna, and, her, birthplace, zamo, a, 45, minute, long, sightseeing, tour, around, areas, associated, with, the, life, of, the, polish, revolutionary, was, organised, in, warsaw, in, 2019, where, a, statue, of, her, by, alfred, jesion, was, also, put, on, display, at, the, warsaw, citadel, as, part, of, the, gallery, of,

discovered, a, preserved, corpse, lacking, head, feet, or, hands, in, the, cellar, of, the, charit, s, medical, history, museum, he, found, the, corpse, s, autopsy, report, suspicious, and, decided, to, perform, a, ct, scan, on, the, remains, the, body, showed, signs, of, having, been, waterlogged, at, some, point, and, the, scans, showed, that, it, was, the, body, of, a, woman, of, 40, 50, years, of, age, who, suffered, from, osteoarthritis, and, had, legs, of, differing, length, as, luxemburg, had, a, laboratory, in, kiel, also, tested, the, corpse, using, radiocarbon, dating, techniques, and, confirmed, that, it, dated, from, the, same, period, as, luxemburg, s, murder, the, original, autopsy, performed, on, 13, june, 1919, on, the, body, that, was, eventually, buried, at, friedrichsfelde, showed, certain, inconsistencies, that, supported, tsokos, hypothesis, the, autopsy, explicitly, noted, an, absence, of, hip, damage, and, stated, that, there, was, no, evidence, that, the, legs, were, of, different, lengths, additionally, the, autopsy, showed, no, traces, on, the, upper, skull, of, the, two, blows, by, rifle, butt, inflicted, upon, luxemburg, finally, while, the, 1919, examiners, noted, a, hole, in, the, corpse, s, head, between, the, left, eye, and, ear, they, did, not, find, an, exit, wound, or, the, presence, of, a, bullet, within, the, skull, assistant, pathologist, paul, fraenckel, appeared, to, doubt, at, the, time, that, the, corpse, he, had, examined, was, luxemburg, s, and, in, a, signed, addendum, distanced, himself, from, his, colleague, s, conclusions, this, addendum, and, the, inconsistencies, between, the, autopsy, report, and, the, known, facts, persuaded, tsokos, to, examine, the, remains, more, closely, according, to, eyewitnesses, when, luxemburg, s, body, was, thrown, into, the, canal, weights, were, wired, to, her, ankles, and, wrists, these, could, have, slowly, severed, her, extremities, in, the, months, her, corpse, spent, in, the, water, which, would, explain, the, missing, hands, and, feet, issue, tsokos, realised, that, dna, testing, was, the, best, way, to, confirm, or, deny, the, identity, of, the, body, as, luxemburg, s, his, team, had, initially, hoped, to, find, traces, of, the, dna, on, old, postage, stamps, that, luxemburg, had, licked, but, it, transpired, that, luxemburg, had, never, done, this, preferring, to, moisten, stamps, with, a, damp, cloth, the, examiners, decided, to, look, for, a, surviving, blood, relative, and, in, july, 2009, the, german, sunday, newspaper, bild, am,

that, while, there, were, indications, that, the, corpse, was, luxemburg, s, there, was, not, enough, evidence, to, provide, conclusive, proof, in, particular, dna, extracted, from, the, hair, of, luxemburg, s, niece, did, not, match, that, belonging, to, the, cadaver, tsokos, had, earlier, said, that, the, chances, of, a, match, were, only, 40, the, remains, were, to, be, buried, at, an, undisclosed, location, while, testing, was, to, continue, on, tissue, samples, this, is, a, list, of, selected, writings
