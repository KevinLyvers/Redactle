sir, william, henry, bragg, om, kbe, frs, 2, july, 1862, 12, march, 1942, was, an, english, physicist, chemist, mathematician, and, active, sportsman, who, uniquely, shared, a, nobel, prize, with, his, son, lawrence, bragg, the, 1915, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, services, in, the, analysis, of, crystal, structure, by, means, of, x, rays, the, mineral, braggite, is, named, after, him, and, his, son, he, was, knighted, in, 1920, bragg, was, born, at, westward, near, wigton, cumberland, england, the, son, of, robert, john, bragg, a, merchant, marine, officer, and, farmer, and, his, wife, mary, n, e, wood, a, clergyman, s, daughter, when, bragg, was, seven, years, old, his, mother, died, and, he, was, raised, by, his, uncle, also, named, william, bragg, at, market, harborough, leicestershire, he, was, educated, at, the, grammar, school, there, at, king, william, s, college, on, the, isle, of, man, and, having, won, an, exhibition, scholarship, at, trinity, college, cambridge, he, graduated, in, 1884, as, third, wrangler, and, in, 1885, was, awarded, a, first, class, honours, in, the, mathematical, tripos, in, 1885, at, the, age, of, 23, bragg, was, appointed, sir, thomas, elder, professor, of, mathematics, and, experimental, physics, in, the, university, of, adelaide, australia, and, started, work, there, early, in, 1886, being, a, skilled, mathematician, at, that, time, he, had, limited, knowledge, of, physics, most, of, which, was, in, the, form, of, applied, mathematics, he, had, learnt, at, trinity, also, at, that, time, there, were, only, about, a, hundred, students, doing, full, courses, at, adelaide, of, whom, less, than, a, handful, belonged, to, the, science, school, whose, deficient, teaching, facilities, bragg, improved, by, apprenticing, himself, to, a, firm, of, instrument, makers, bragg, was, an, able, and, popular, lecturer, he, encouraged, the, formation, of, the, student, union, and, the, attendance, free, of, charge, of, science, teachers, at, his, lectures, bragg, s, interest, in, physics, developed, particularly, in, the, field, of, electromagnetism, in, 1895, he, was, visited, by, ernest, rutherford, en, route, from, new, zealand, to, cambridge, this, was, the, commencement, of, a, lifelong, friendship, bragg, had, a, keen, interest, in, the, new, discovery, of, x, rays, by, wilhelm, r, ntgen, on, 29, may, 1896, at, adelaide, bragg, demonstrated, before, a, meeting, of, local, doctors, the, application, of, x, rays, to, reveal, structures, that, were, otherwise, invisible, samuel, barbour, senior, chemist, of, f, h, faulding, co, an, adelaide, pharmaceutical, manufacturer, supplied, the, necessary, apparatus, in, the, form, of, a, crookes, tube, a, glass, discharge, tube, the, tube, had, been, obtained, at, leeds, england, where, barbour, visited, the, firm, of, reynolds, and, branson, a, manufacturer, of, photographic, and, laboratory, equipment, barbour, returned, to, adelaide, in, april, 1896, barbour, had, conducted, his, own, experiments, shortly, after, return, to, australia, but, results, were, limited, due, to, limited, battery, power, at, the, university, the, tube, was, attached, to, an, induction, coil, and, a, battery, borrowed, from, sir, charles, todd, bragg, s, father, in, law, the, induction, coil, was, utilized, to, produce, the, electric, spark, necessary, for, bragg, and, barbour, to, generate, short, bursts, of, x, rays, the, audience, was, favorably, impressed, bragg, availed, himself, as, a, test, subject, in, the, manner, of, r, ntgen, and, allowed, an, x, ray, photograph, to, be, taken, of, his, hand, the, image, of, the, fingers, in, his, hand, revealed, an, old, injury, to, one, of, his, fingers, sustained, when, using, the, turnip, chopping, machine, on, his, father, s, farm, in, cumbria, as, early, as, 1895, professor, william, h, later, sir, william, bragg, was, working, on, wireless, telegraphy, though, public, lectures, and, demonstrations, focussed, on, his, x, ray, research, which, would, later, lead, to, his, nobel, prize, in, a, hurried, visit, by, rutherford, he, was, reported, as, working, on, a, hertzian, oscillator, there, were, many, common, practical, threads, to, the, two, technologies, and, he, was, ably, assisted, in, the, laboratory, by, arthur, lionel, rogers, who, manufactured, much, of, the, equipment, on, 21, september, 1897, bragg, gave, the, first, recorded, public, demonstration, of, the, working, of, wireless, telegraphy, in, australia, during, a, lecture, meeting, at, the, university, of, adelaide, as, part, of, the, public, teachers, union, conference, bragg, departed, adelaide, in, december, 1897, and, spent, all, of, 1898, on, a, 12, month, leave, of, absence, touring, great, britain, and, europe, and, during, this, time, visited, marconi, and, inspected, his, wireless, facilities, he, returned, to, adelaide, in, early, march, 1899, and, already, on, 13, may, 1899, bragg, and, his, father, in, law, sir, charles, todd, were, conducting, preliminary, tests, of, wireless, telegraphy, with, a, transmitter, at, the, observatory, and, a, receiver, on, the, south, road, about, 200, metres, experiments, continued, throughout, the, southern, winter, of, 1899, and, the, range, was, progressively, extended, to, henley, beach, in, september, the, work, was, extended, to, two, way, transmissions, with, the, addition, of, a, second, induction, coil, loaned, by, mr, oddie, of, ballarat, it, was, desired, to, extend, the, experiments, cross, a, sea, path, and, todd, was, interested, in, connecting, cape, spencer, and, althorpe, island, but, local, costs, were, considered, prohibitive, while, the, charges, for, patented, equipment, from, the, marconi, company, were, exorbitant, at, the, same, time, bragg, s, interests, were, leaning, towards, x, rays, and, practical, work, in, wireless, in, south, australia, was, largely, dormant, for, the, next, decade, the, turning, point, in, bragg, s, career, came, in, 1904, when, he, gave, the, presidential, address, to, section, a, of, the, australasian, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, at, dunedin, new, zealand, on, some, recent, advances, in, the, theory, of, the, ionization, of, gases, this, idea, was, followed, up, in, a, brilliant, series, of, researches, which, within, three, years, earned, him, a, fellowship, of, the, royal, society, of, london, this, paper, was, also, the, origin, of, his, first, book, studies, in, radioactivity, 1912, soon, after, the, delivery, of, his, 1904, address, some, radium, bromide, was, made, available, to, bragg, for, experimentation, in, december, 1904, his, paper, on, the, absorption, of, rays, and, on, the, classification, of, the, rays, from, radium, appeared, in, the, philosophical, magazine, and, in, the, same, issue, a, paper, on, the, ionization, curves, of, radium, written, in, collaboration, with, his, student, richard, kleeman, also, appeared, at, the, end, of, 1908, bragg, returned, to, england, during, his, 23, years, in, australia, he, had, seen, the, number, of, students, at, the, university, of, adelaide, almost, quadruple, and, had, a, full, share, in, the, development, of, its, excellent, science, school, he, had, returned, to, england, on, the, maiden, voyage, of, the, ss, waratah, a, ship, which, vanished, at, sea, on, its, second, voyage, the, next, year, he, had, been, alarmed, at, the, ship, s, tendency, to, list, during, his, voyage, and, had, concluded, that, the, ship, s, metacentre, was, just, below, her, centre, of, gravity, in, 1911, he, testified, his, belief, that, the, waratah, was, unstable, at, the, inquiry, into, the, ship, s, disappearance, there, is, a, bust, of, william, bragg, in, north, terrace, adelaide, south, australia, bragg, occupied, the, cavendish, chair, of, physics, at, the, university, of, leeds, from, 1909, until, 1915, he, continued, his, work, on, x, rays, with, much, success, he, invented, the, x, ray, spectrometer, and, with, his, son, lawrence, bragg, then, a, research, student, at, cambridge, founded, the, new, science, of, x, ray, crystallography, the, analysis, of, crystal, structure, using, x, ray, diffraction, both, of, his, sons, were, called, into, the, army, after, war, broke, out, in, 1914, the, following, year, he, was, appointed, quain, professor, of, physics, at, university, college, london, he, had, to, wait, for, almost, a, year, to, contribute, to, the, war, effort, finally, in, july, 1915, he, was, appointed, to, the, board, of, invention, and, research, set, up, by, the, admiralty, in, september, his, younger, son, robert, died, of, wounds, at, gallipoli, in, november, he, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, elder, son, william, lawrence, the, navy, was, struggling, to, prevent, sinkings, by, unseen, submerged, u, boats, the, scientists, recommended, that, the, best, tactic, was, to, listen, for, the, submarines, the, navy, had, a, hydrophone, research, establishment, at, aberdour, scotland, staffed, with, navy, men, in, november, 1915, two, young, physicists, were, added, to, its, staff, bowing, to, outside, pressure, for, using, science, in, july, 1916, the, admiralty, appointed, bragg, as, scientific, director, at, aberdour, assisted, by, three, additional, young, physicists, they, developed, an, improved, directional, hydrophone, which, finally, convinced, the, admiralty, of, their, usefulness, late, in, 1916, bragg, with, his, small, group, moved, to, harwich, where, the, staff, was, enlarged, and, they, had, access, to, a, submarine, for, tests, in, france, where, scientists, had, been, mobilized, since, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, physicist, paul, langevin, made, a, major, stride, with, echolocation, generating, intense, sound, pulses, with, quartz, sheets, oscillated, at, high, frequency, which, were, then, used, as, microphones, to, listen, for, echoes, quartz, was, usable, when, vacuum, tubes, became, available, at, the, end, of, 1917, to, amplify, the, faint, signals, the, british, made, sonar, practicable, by, using, mosaics, of, small, quartz, bits, rather, than, slices, from, a, large, crystal, in, january, 1918, bragg, moved, into, the, admiralty, as, head, of, scientific, research, in, the, anti, submarine, division, by, war, s, end, british, vessels, were, being, equipped, with, sonar, manned, by, trained, listeners, inspired, by, william, lawrence, s, methods, for, locating, enemy, guns, by, the, sound, of, their, firing, the, output, from, six, microphones, miles, apart, along, the, coast, were, recorded, on, moving, photographic, film, sound, ranging, is, much, more, accurate, in, the, sea, than, in, the, turbulent, atmosphere, they, were, able, to, localize, the, sites, of, distant, explosions, which, were, used, to, obtain, the, precise, positions, of, british, warships, and, of, minefields, after, the, war, bragg, returned, to, university, college, london, where, he, continued, to, work, on, crystal, analysis, from, 1923, he, was, fullerian, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, royal, institution, and, director, of, the, davy, faraday, research, laboratory, this, institution, was, practically, rebuilt, in, 1929, 30, and, under, bragg, s, directorship, many, valuable, papers, were, issued, from, the, laboratory, in, 1919, 1923, 1925, and, 1931, he, was, invited, to, deliver, the, royal, institution, christmas, lecture, on, the, world, of, sound, concerning, the, nature, of, things, old, trades, and, new, knowledge, and, the, universe, of, life, respectively, bragg, was, elected, president, of, the, royal, society, in, 1935, the, physiologist, a, v, hill, was, biological, secretary, and, soon, a, c, g, egerton, became, physical, secretary, during, world, war, i, all, three, had, stood, by, for, frustrating, months, before, their, skills, were, employed, for, the, war, effort, now, the, cause, of, science, was, strengthened, by, the, report, of, a, high, level, army, committee, on, lessons, learned, in, the, last, war, their, first, recommendation, was, to, keep, abreast, of, modern, scientific, developments, anticipating, another, war, the, ministry, of, labour, was, persuaded, to, accept, hill, as, a, consultant, on, scientific, manpower, the, royal, society, compiled, a, register, of, qualified, men, they, proposed, a, small, committee, on, science, to, advise, the, committee, on, imperial, defence, but, this, was, rejected, finally, in, 1940, as, bragg, s, term, ended, a, scientific, advisory, committee, to, the, war, cabinet, was, appointed, brag, was, among, the, 2, 300, names, of, prominent, persons, listed, on, the, nazis, special, search, list, of, those, who, were, to, be, arrested, on, the, invasion, of, great, britain, and, turned, over, to, the, gestapo, bragg, died, in, 1942, bragg, was, joint, winner, with, his, son, lawrence, bragg, of, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1915, for, their, services, in, the, analysis, of, crystal, structure, by, means, of, x, ray, bragg, was, elected, fellow, of, the, royal,
