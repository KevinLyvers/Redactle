james, clerk, maxwell, frs, frse, 13, june, 1831, 5, november, 1879, was, a, scottish, physicist, with, broad, interests, who, was, responsible, for, the, classical, theory, of, electromagnetic, radiation, which, was, the, first, theory, to, describe, electricity, magnetism, and, light, as, different, manifestations, of, the, same, phenomenon, maxwell, s, equations, for, electromagnetism, have, been, called, the, second, great, unification, in, physics, where, the, first, one, had, been, realised, by, isaac, newton, with, the, publication, of, a, dynamical, theory, of, the, electromagnetic, field, in, 1865, maxwell, demonstrated, that, electric, and, magnetic, fields, travel, through, space, as, waves, moving, at, the, speed, of, light, he, proposed, that, light, is, an, undulation, in, the, same, medium, that, is, the, cause, of, electric, and, magnetic, phenomena, the, unification, of, light, and, electrical, phenomena, led, to, his, prediction, of, the, existence, of, radio, waves, maxwell, is, also, regarded, as, a, founder, of, the, modern, field, of, electrical, engineering, maxwell, was, the, first, to, derive, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, a, statistical, means, of, describing, aspects, of, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, which, he, worked, on, sporadically, throughout, his, career, he, is, also, known, for, presenting, the, first, durable, colour, photograph, in, 1861, and, for, his, foundational, work, on, analysing, the, rigidity, of, rod, and, joint, frameworks, trusses, like, those, in, many, bridges, he, is, responsible, for, modern, dimensional, analysis, maxwell, is, also, recognized, for, laying, the, groundwork, for, chaos, theory, his, discoveries, helped, usher, in, the, era, of, modern, physics, laying, the, foundation, for, such, fields, as, special, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, many, physicists, regard, maxwell, as, the, 19th, century, scientist, having, the, greatest, influence, on, 20th, century, physics, his, contributions, to, the, science, are, considered, by, many, to, be, of, the, same, magnitude, as, those, of, isaac, newton, and, albert, einstein, in, the, millennium, poll, a, survey, of, the, 100, most, prominent, physicists, maxwell, was, voted, the, third, greatest, physicist, of, all, time, behind, only, newton, and, einstein, on, the, centenary, of, maxwell, s, birthday, einstein, described, maxwell, s, work, as, the, most, profound, and, the, most, fruitful, that, physics, has, experienced, since, the, time, of, newton, einstein, when, he, visited, the, university, of, cambridge, in, 1922, was, told, by, his, host, that, he, had, done, great, things, because, he, stood, on, newton, s, shoulders, einstein, replied, no, i, don, t, i, stand, on, the, shoulders, of, maxwell, tom, siegfried, described, maxwell, as, one, of, those, once, in, a, century, geniuses, who, perceived, the, physical, world, with, sharper, senses, than, those, around, him, james, clerk, maxwell, was, born, on, 13, june, 1831, at, 14, india, street, edinburgh, to, john, clerk, maxwell, of, middlebie, an, advocate, and, frances, cay, daughter, of, robert, hodshon, cay, and, sister, of, john, cay, his, birthplace, now, houses, a, museum, operated, by, the, james, clerk, maxwell, foundation, his, father, was, a, man, of, comfortable, means, of, the, clerk, family, of, penicuik, holders, of, the, baronetcy, of, clerk, of, penicuik, his, father, s, brother, was, the, 6th, baronet, he, had, been, born, john, clerk, adding, maxwell, to, his, own, after, he, inherited, as, an, infant, in, 1793, the, middlebie, estate, a, maxwell, property, in, dumfriesshire, james, was, a, first, cousin, of, both, the, artist, jemima, blackburn, the, daughter, of, his, father, s, sister, and, the, civil, engineer, william, dyce, cay, the, son, of, his, mother, s, brother, cay, and, maxwell, were, close, friends, and, cay, acted, as, his, best, man, when, maxwell, married, maxwell, s, parents, met, and, married, when, they, were, well, into, their, thirties, his, mother, was, nearly, 40, when, he, was, born, they, had, had, one, earlier, child, a, daughter, named, elizabeth, who, died, in, infancy, when, maxwell, was, young, his, family, moved, to, glenlair, in, kirkcudbrightshire, which, his, parents, had, built, on, the, estate, which, comprised, 1, 500, acres, 610, ha, all, indications, suggest, that, maxwell, had, maintained, an, unquenchable, curiosity, from, an, early, age, by, the, age, of, three, everything, that, moved, shone, or, made, a, noise, drew, the, question, what, s, the, go, o, that, in, a, passage, added, to, a, letter, from, his, father, to, his, sister, in, law, jane, cay, in, 1834, his, mother, described, this, innate, sense, of, inquisitiveness, he, is, a, very, happy, man, and, has, improved, much, since, the, weather, got, moderate, he, has, great, work, with, doors, locks, keys, etc, and, show, me, how, it, doos, is, never, out, of, his, mouth, he, also, investigates, the, hidden, course, of, streams, and, bell, wires, the, way, the, water, gets, from, the, pond, through, the, wall, recognising, the, boy, s, potential, maxwell, s, mother, frances, took, responsibility, for, his, early, education, which, in, the, victorian, era, was, largely, the, job, of, the, woman, of, the, house, at, eight, he, could, recite, long, passages, of, john, milton, and, the, whole, of, the, 119th, psalm, 176, verses, indeed, his, knowledge, of, scripture, was, already, detailed, he, could, give, chapter, and, verse, for, almost, any, quotation, from, the, psalms, his, mother, was, taken, ill, with, abdominal, cancer, and, after, an, unsuccessful, operation, died, in, december, 1839, when, he, was, eight, years, old, his, education, was, then, overseen, by, his, father, and, his, father, s, sister, in, law, jane, both, of, whom, played, pivotal, roles, in, his, life, his, formal, schooling, began, unsuccessfully, under, the, guidance, of, a, 16, year, old, hired, tutor, little, is, known, about, the, young, man, hired, to, instruct, maxwell, except, that, he, treated, the, younger, boy, harshly, chiding, him, for, being, slow, and, wayward, the, tutor, was, dismissed, in, november, 1841, james, father, took, him, to, robert, davidson, s, demonstration, of, electric, propulsion, and, magnetic, force, on, 12, february, 1842, an, experience, with, profound, implications, for, the, boy, maxwell, was, sent, to, the, prestigious, edinburgh, academy, he, lodged, during, term, times, at, the, house, of, his, aunt, isabella, during, this, time, his, passion, for, drawing, was, encouraged, by, his, older, cousin, jemima, the, 10, year, old, maxwell, having, been, raised, in, isolation, on, his, father, s, countryside, estate, did, not, fit, in, well, at, school, the, first, year, had, been, full, obliging, him, to, join, the, second, year, with, classmates, a, year, his, senior, his, mannerisms, and, galloway, accent, struck, the, other, boys, as, rustic, having, arrived, on, his, first, day, of, school, wearing, a, pair, of, homemade, shoes, and, a, tunic, he, earned, the, unkind, nickname, of, daftie, he, never, seemed, to, resent, the, epithet, bearing, it, without, complaint, for, many, years, social, isolation, at, the, academy, ended, when, he, met, lewis, campbell, and, peter, guthrie, tait, two, boys, of, a, similar, age, who, were, to, become, notable, scholars, later, in, life, they, remained, lifelong, friends, maxwell, was, fascinated, by, geometry, at, an, early, age, rediscovering, the, regular, polyhedra, before, he, received, any, formal, instruction, despite, his, winning, the, school, s, scripture, biography, prize, in, his, second, year, his, academic, work, remained, unnoticed, until, at, the, age, of, 13, he, won, the, school, s, mathematical, medal, and, first, prize, for, both, english, and, poetry, maxwell, s, interests, ranged, far, beyond, the, school, syllabus, and, he, did, not, pay, particular, attention, to, examination, performance, he, wrote, his, first, scientific, paper, at, the, age, of, 14, in, it, he, described, a, mechanical, means, of, drawing, mathematical, curves, with, a, piece, of, twine, and, the, properties, of, ellipses, cartesian, ovals, and, related, curves, with, more, than, two, foci, the, work, of, 1846, on, the, description, of, oval, curves, and, those, having, a, plurality, of, foci, was, presented, to, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, by, james, forbes, a, professor, of, natural, philosophy, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, because, maxwell, was, deemed, too, young, to, present, the, work, himself, the, work, was, not, entirely, original, since, ren, descartes, had, also, examined, the, properties, of, such, multifocal, ellipses, in, the, 17th, century, but, maxwell, had, simplified, their, construction, maxwell, left, the, academy, in, 1847, at, age, 16, and, began, attending, classes, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, he, had, the, opportunity, to, attend, the, university, of, cambridge, but, decided, after, his, first, term, to, complete, the, full, course, of, his, undergraduate, studies, at, edinburgh, the, academic, staff, of, the, university, included, some, highly, regarded, names, his, first, year, tutors, included, sir, william, hamilton, who, lectured, him, on, logic, and, metaphysics, philip, kelland, on, mathematics, and, james, forbes, on, natural, philosophy, he, did, not, find, his, classes, demanding, and, was, therefore, able, to, immerse, himself, in, private, study, during, free, time, at, the, university, and, particularly, when, back, home, at, glenlair, there, he, would, experiment, with, improvised, chemical, electric, and, magnetic, apparatus, however, his, chief, concerns, regarded, the, properties, of, polarised, light, he, constructed, shaped, blocks, of, gelatine, subjected, them, to, various, stresses, and, with, a, pair, of, polarising, prisms, given, to, him, by, william, nicol, viewed, the, coloured, fringes, that, had, developed, within, the, jelly, through, this, practice, he, discovered, photoelasticity, which, is, a, means, of, determining, the, stress, distribution, within, physical, structures, at, age, 18, maxwell, contributed, two, papers, for, the, transactions, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, one, of, these, on, the, equilibrium, of, elastic, solids, laid, the, foundation, for, an, important, discovery, later, in, his, life, which, was, the, temporary, double, refraction, produced, in, viscous, liquids, by, shear, stress, his, other, paper, was, rolling, curves, and, just, as, with, the, paper, oval, curves, that, he, had, written, at, the, edinburgh, academy, he, was, again, considered, too, young, to, stand, at, the, rostrum, to, present, it, himself, the, paper, was, delivered, to, the, royal, society, by, his, tutor, kelland, instead, in, october, 1850, already, an, accomplished, mathematician, maxwell, left, scotland, for, the, university, of, cambridge, he, initially, attended, peterhouse, but, before, the, end, of, his, first, term, transferred, to, trinity, where, he, believed, it, would, be, easier, to, obtain, a, fellowship, at, trinity, he, was, elected, to, the, elite, secret, society, known, as, the, cambridge, apostles, maxwell, s, intellectual, understanding, of, his, christian, faith, and, of, science, grew, rapidly, during, his, cambridge, years, he, joined, the, apostles, an, exclusive, debating, society, of, the, intellectual, elite, where, through, his, essays, he, sought, to, work, out, this, understanding, now, my, great, plan, which, was, conceived, of, old, is, to, let, nothing, be, wilfully, left, unexamined, nothing, is, to, be, holy, ground, consecrated, to, stationary, faith, whether, positive, or, negative, all, fallow, land, is, to, be, ploughed, up, and, a, regular, system, of, rotation, followed, never, hide, anything, be, it, weed, or, no, nor, seem, to, wish, it, hidden, again, i, assert, the, right, of, trespass, on, any, plot, of, holy, ground, which, any, man, has, set, apart, now, i, am, convinced, that, no, one, but, a, christian, can, actually, purge, his, land, of, these, holy, spots, i, do, not, say, that, no, christians, have, enclosed, places, of, this, sort, many, have, a, great, deal, and, every, one, has, some, but, there, are, extensive, and, important, tracts, in, the, territory, of, the, scoffer, the, pantheist, the, quietist, formalist, dogmatist, sensualist, and, the, rest, which, are, openly, and, solemnly, tabooed, christianity, that, is, the, religion, of, the, bible, is, the, only, scheme, or, form, of, belief, which, disavows, any, possessions, on, such, a, tenure, here, alone, all, is, free, you, may, fly, to, the, ends, of, the, world, and, find, no, god, but, the, author, of, salvation, you, may, search, the, scriptures, and, not, find, a, text, to, stop, you, in, your, explorations, the, old, testament, and, the, mosaic, law, and, judaism, are, commonly, supposed, to, be, tabooed, by, the, orthodox, sceptics, pretend, to, have, read, them, and, have, found, certain, witty, objections, which, too, many, of, the, orthodox, unread, admit, and, shut, up, the, subject, as, haunted, but, a, candle, is, coming, to, drive, out, all, ghosts, and, bugbears, let, us, follow, the, light, in, the, summer, of, his, third, year, maxwell, spent, some, time, at, the, suffolk, home, of, the, rev, c, b, tayler, the, uncle, of, a, classmate, g, w, h, tayler, the, love, of, god, shown, by, the, family, impressed, maxwell, particularly, after, he, was, nursed, back, from, ill, health, by, the, minister, and, his, wife, on, his, return, to, cambridge, maxwell, writes, to, his, recent, host, a, chatty, and, affectionate, letter, including, the, following, testimony, i, have, the, capacity, of, being, more, wicked, than, any, example, that, man, could, set, me, and, if, i, escape, it, is, only, by, god, s, grace, helping, me, to, get, rid, of, myself, partially, in, science, more, completely, in, society, but, not, perfectly, except, by, committing, myself, to, god, in, november, 1851, maxwell, studied, under, william, hopkins, whose, success, in, nurturing, mathematical, genius, had, earned, him, the, nickname, of, senior, wrangler, maker, in, 1854, maxwell, graduated, from, trinity, with, a, degree, in, mathematics, he, scored, second, highest, in, the, final, examination, coming, behind, edward, routh, and, earning, himself, the, title, of, second, wrangler, he, was, later, declared, equal, with, routh, in, the, more, exacting, ordeal, of, the, smith, s, prize, examination, immediately, after, earning, his, degree, maxwell, read, his, paper, on, the, transformation, of, surfaces, by, bending, to, the, cambridge, philosophical, society, this, is, one, of, the, few, purely, mathematical, papers, he, had, written, demonstrating, his, growing, stature, as, a, mathematician, maxwell, decided, to, remain, at, trinity, after, graduating, and, applied, for, a, fellowship, which, was, a, process, that, he, could, expect, to, take, a, couple, of, years, buoyed, by, his, success, as, a, research, student, he, would, be, free, apart, from, some, tutoring, and, examining, duties, to, pursue, scientific, interests, at, his, own, leisure, the, nature, and, perception, of, colour, was, one, such, interest, which, he, had, begun, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, while, he, was, a, student, of, forbes, with, the, coloured, spinning, tops, invented, by, forbes, maxwell, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, white, light, would, result, from, a, mixture, of, red, green, and, blue, light, his, paper, experiments, on, colour, laid, out, the, principles, of, colour, combination, and, was, presented, to, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, march, 1855, maxwell, was, this, time, able, to, deliver, it, himself, maxwell, was, made, a, fellow, of, trinity, on, 10, october, 1855, sooner, than, was, the, norm, and, was, asked, to, prepare, lectures, on, hydrostatics, and, optics, and, to, set, examination, papers, the, following, february, he, was, urged, by, forbes, to, apply, for, the, newly, vacant, chair, of, natural, philosophy, at, marischal, college, aberdeen, his, father, assisted, him, in, the, task, of, preparing, the, necessary, references, but, died, on, 2, april, at, glenlair, before, either, knew, the, result, of, maxwell, s, candidacy, he, accepted, the, professorship, at, aberdeen, leaving, cambridge, in, november, 1856, the, 25, year, old, maxwell, was, a, good, 15, years, younger, than, any, other, professor, at, marischal, he, engaged, himself, with, his, new, responsibilities, as, head, of, a, department, devising, the, syllabus, and, preparing, lectures, he, committed, himself, to, lecturing, 15, hours, a, week, including, a, weekly, pro, bono, lecture, to, the, local, working, men, s, college, he, lived, in, aberdeen, with, his, cousin, william, dyce, cay, a, scottish, civil, engineer, during, the, six, months, of, the, academic, year, and, spent, the, summers, at, glenlair, which, he, had, inherited, from, his, father, later, his, former, student, described, maxwell, as, follows, in, the, late, 1850s, shortly, before, 9, am, any, winter, s, morning, you, might, well, have, seen, the, young, james, clerk, maxwell, in, his, mid, to, late, 20s, a, man, of, middling, height, with, frame, strongly, knit, and, a, certain, spring, and, elasticity, in, his, gait, dressed, for, comfortable, ease, rather, than, elegance, a, face, expressive, at, once, of, sagacity, and, good, humour, but, overlaid, with, a, deep, shade, of, thoughtfulness, features, boldly, put, pleasingly, marked, eyes, dark, and, glowing, hair, and, beard, perfectly, black, and, forming, a, strong, contrast, to, the, pallor, of, his, complexion, he, focused, his, attention, on, a, problem, that, had, eluded, scientists, for, 200, years, the, nature, of, saturn, s, rings, it, was, unknown, how, they, could, remain, stable, without, breaking, up, drifting, away, or, crashing, into, saturn, the, problem, took, on, a, particular, resonance, at, that, time, because, st, john, s, college, cambridge, had, chosen, it, as, the, topic, for, the, 1857, adams, prize, maxwell, devoted, two, years, to, studying, the, problem, proving, that, a, regular, solid, ring, could, not, be, stable, while, a, fluid, ring, would, be, forced, by, wave, action, to, break, up, into, blobs, since, neither, was, observed, he, concluded, that, the, rings, must, be, composed, of, numerous, small, particles, he, called, brick, bats, each, independently, orbiting, saturn, maxwell, was, awarded, the, 130, adams, prize, in, 1859, for, his, essay, on, the, stability, of, the, motion, of, saturn, s, rings, he, was, the, only, entrant, to, have, made, enough, headway, to, submit, an, entry, his, work, was, so, detailed, and, convincing, that, when, george, biddell, airy, read, it, he, commented, it, is, one, of, the, most, remarkable, applications, of, mathematics, to, physics, that, i, have, ever, seen, it, was, considered, the, final, word, on, the, issue, until, direct, observations, by, the, voyager, flybys, of, the, 1980s, confirmed, maxwell, s, prediction, that, the, rings, were, composed, of, particles, it, is, now, understood, however, that, the, rings, particles, are, not, totally, stable, being, pulled, by, gravity, onto, saturn, the, rings, are, expected, to, vanish, entirely, over, the, next, 300, million, years, in, 1857, maxwell, befriended, the, reverend, daniel, dewar, who, was, then, the, principal, of, marischal, through, him, maxwell, met, dewar, s, daughter, katherine, mary, dewar, they, were, engaged, in, february, 1858, and, married, in, aberdeen, on, 2, june, 1858, on, the, marriage, record, maxwell, is, listed, as, professor, of, natural, philosophy, in, marischal, college, aberdeen, katherine, was, seven, years, maxwell, s, senior, comparatively, little, is, known, of, her, although, it, is, known, that, she, helped, in, his, lab, and, worked, on, experiments, in, viscosity, maxwell, s, biographer, and, friend, lewis, campbell, adopted, an, uncharacteristic, reticence, on, the, subject, of, katherine, though, describing, their, married, life, as, one, of, unexampled, devotion, in, 1860, marischal, college, merged, with, the, neighbouring, king, s, college, to, form, the, university, of, aberdeen, there, was, no, room, for, two, professors, of, natural, philosophy, so, maxwell, despite, his, scientific, reputation, found, himself, laid, off, he, was, unsuccessful, in, applying, for, forbes, s, recently, vacated, chair, at, edinburgh, the, post, instead, going, to, tait, maxwell, was, granted, the, chair, of, natural, philosophy, at, king, s, college, london, instead, after, recovering, from, a, near, fatal, bout, of, smallpox, in, 1860, he, moved, to, london, with, his, wife, maxwell, s, time, at, king, s, was, probably, the, most, productive, of, his, career, he, was, awarded, the, royal, society, s, rumford, medal, in, 1860, for, his, work, on, colour, and, was, later, elected, to, the, society, in, 1861, this, period, of, his, life, would, see, him, display, the, world, s, first, light, fast, colour, photograph, further, develop, his, ideas, on, the, viscosity, of, gases, and, propose, a, system, of, defining, physical, quantities, now, known, as, dimensional, analysis, maxwell, would, often, attend, lectures, at, the, royal, institution, where, he, came, into, regular, contact, with, michael, faraday, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, could, not, be, described, as, being, close, because, faraday, was, 40, years, maxwell, s, senior, and, showed, signs, of, senility, they, nevertheless, maintained, a, strong, respect, for, each, other, s, talents, this, time, is, especially, noteworthy, for, the, advances, maxwell, made, in, the, fields, of, electricity, and, magnetism, he, examined, the, nature, of, both, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, his, two, part, paper, on, physical, lines, of, force, which, was, published, in, 1861, in, it, he, provided, a, conceptual, model, for, electromagnetic, induction, consisting, of, tiny, spinning, cells, of, magnetic, flux, two, more, parts, were, later, added, to, and, published, in, that, same, paper, in, early, 1862, in, the, first, additional, part, he, discussed, the, nature, of, electrostatics, and, displacement, current, in, the, second, additional, part, he, dealt, with, the, rotation, of, the, plane, of, the, polarisation, of, light, in, a, magnetic, field, a, phenomenon, that, had, been, discovered, by, faraday, and, is, now, known, as, the, faraday, effect, in, 1865, maxwell, resigned, the, chair, at, king, s, college, london, and, returned, to, glenlair, with, katherine, in, his, paper, on, governors, 1868, he, mathematically, described, the, behaviour, of, governors, devices, that, control, the, speed, of, steam, engines, thereby, establishing, the, theoretical, basis, of, control, engineering, in, his, paper, on, reciprocal, figures, frames, and, diagrams, of, forces, 1870, he, discussed, the, rigidity, of, various, designs, of, lattice, he, wrote, the, textbook, theory, of, heat, 1871, and, the, treatise, matter, and, motion, 1876, maxwell, was, also, the, first, to, make, explicit, use, of, dimensional, analysis, in, 1871, in, 1871, he, returned, to, cambridge, to, become, the, first, cavendish, professor, of, physics, maxwell, was, put, in, charge, of, the, development, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, supervising, every, step, in, the, progress, of, the, building, and, of, the, purchase, of, the, collection, of, apparatus, one, of, maxwell, s, last, great, contributions, to, science, was, the, editing, with, copious, original, notes, of, the, research, of, henry, cavendish, from, which, it, appeared, that, cavendish, researched, amongst, other, things, such, questions, as, the, density, of, the, earth, and, the, composition, of, water, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1876, in, april, 1879, maxwell, began, to, have, difficulty, in, swallowing, the, first, symptom, of, his, fatal, illness, maxwell, died, in, cambridge, of, abdominal, cancer, on, 5, november, 1879, at, the, age, of, 48, his, mother, had, died, at, the, same, age, of, the, same, type, of, cancer, the, minister, who, regularly, visited, him, in, his, last, weeks, was, astonished, at, his, lucidity, and, the, immense, power, and, scope, of, his, memory, but, comments, more, particularly, his, illness, drew, out, the, whole, heart, and, soul, and, spirit, of, the, man, his, firm, and, undoubting, faith, in, the, incarnation, and, all, its, results, in, the, full, sufficiency, of, the, atonement, in, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, he, had, gauged, and, fathomed, all, the, schemes, and, systems, of, philosophy, and, had, found, them, utterly, empty, and, unsatisfying, unworkable, was, his, own, word, about, them, and, he, turned, with, simple, faith, to, the, gospel, of, the, saviour, as, death, approached, maxwell, told, a, cambridge, colleague, i, have, been, thinking, how, very, gently, i, have, always, been, dealt, with, i, have, never, had, a, violent, shove, all, my, life, the, only, desire, which, i, can, have, is, like, david, to, serve, my, own, generation, by, the, will, of, god, and, then, fall, asleep, maxwell, is, buried, at, parton, kirk, near, castle, douglas, in, galloway, close, to, where, he, grew, up, the, extended, biography, the, life, of, james, clerk, maxwell, by, his, former, schoolfellow, and, lifelong, friend, professor, lewis, campbell, was, published, in, 1882, his, collected, works, were, issued, in, two, volumes, by, the, cambridge, university, press, in, 1890, the, executors, of, maxwell, s, estate, were, his, physician, george, edward, paget, g, g, stokes, and, colin, mackenzie, who, was, maxwell, s, cousin, overburdened, with, work, stokes, passed, maxwell, s, papers, to, william, garnett, who, had, effective, custody, of, the, papers, until, about, 1884, there, is, a, memorial, inscription, to, him, near, the, choir, screen, at, westminster, abbey, as, a, great, lover, of, scottish, poetry, maxwell, memorised, poems, and, wrote, his, own, the, best, known, is, rigid, body, sings, closely, based, on, comin, through, the, rye, by, robert, burns, which, he, apparently, used, to, sing, while, accompanying, himself, on, a, guitar, it, has, the, opening, lines, gin, a, body, meet, a, body, flyin, through, the, air, gin, a, body, hit, a, body, will, it, fly, and, where, a, collection, of, his, poems, was, published, by, his, friend, lewis, campbell, in, 1882, descriptions, of, maxwell, remark, upon, his, remarkable, intellectual, qualities, being, matched, by, social, awkwardness, maxwell, wrote, the, following, aphorism, for, his, own, conduct, as, a, scientist, he, that, would, enjoy, life, and, act, with, freedom, must, have, the, work, of, the, day, continually, before, his, eyes, not, yesterday, s, work, lest, he, fall, into, despair, not, to, morrow, s, lest, he, become, a, visionary, not, that, which, ends, with, the, day, which, is, a, worldly, work, nor, yet, that, only, which, remains, to, eternity, for, by, it, he, cannot, shape, his, action, happy, is, the, man, who, can, recognize, in, the, work, of, to, day, a, connected, portion, of, the, work, of, life, and, an, embodiment, of, the, work, of, eternity, the, foundations, of, his, confidence, are, unchangeable, for, he, has, been, made, a, partaker, of, infinity, he, strenuously, works, out, his, daily, enterprises, because, the, present, is, given, him, for, a, possession, maxwell, was, an, evangelical, presbyterian, and, in, his, later, years, became, an, elder, of, the, church, of, scotland, maxwell, s, religious, beliefs, and, related, activities, have, been, the, focus, of, a, number, of, papers, attending, both, church, of, scotland, his, father, s, denomination, and, episcopalian, his, mother, s, denomination, services, as, a, child, maxwell, underwent, an, evangelical, conversion, in, april, 1853, one, facet, of, this, conversion, may, have, aligned, him, with, an, antipositivist, position, maxwell, had, studied, and, commented, on, electricity, and, magnetism, as, early, as, 1855, when, his, paper, on, faraday, s, lines, of, force, was, read, to, the, cambridge, philosophical, society, the, paper, presented, a, simplified, model, of, faraday, s, work, and, how, electricity, and, magnetism, are, related, he, reduced, all, of, the, current, knowledge, into, a, linked, set, of, differential, equations, with, 20, equations, in, 20, variables, this, work, was, later, published, as, on, physical, lines, of, force, in, march, 1861, around, 1862, while, lecturing, at, king, s, college, maxwell, calculated, that, the, speed, of, propagation, of, an, electromagnetic, field, is, approximately, that, of, the, speed, of, light, he, considered, this, to, be, more, than, just, a, coincidence, commenting, we, can, scarcely, avoid, the, conclusion, that, light, consists, in, the, transverse, undulations, of, the, same, medium, which, is, the, cause, of, electric, and, magnetic, phenomena, working, on, the, problem, further, maxwell, showed, that, the, equations, predict, the, existence, of, waves, of, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, that, travel, through, empty, space, at, a, speed, that, could, be, predicted, from, simple, electrical, experiments, using, the, data, available, at, the, time, maxwell, obtained, a, velocity, of, 310, 740, 000, metres, per, second, 1, 0195, 10, 9, ft, s, in, his, 1865, paper, a, dynamical, theory, of, the, electromagnetic, field, maxwell, wrote, the, agreement, of, the, results, seems, to, show, that, light, and, magnetism, are, affections, of, the, same, substance, and, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, disturbance, propagated, through, the, field, according, to, electromagnetic, laws, his, famous, twenty, equations, in, their, modern, form, of, partial, differential, equations, first, appeared, in, fully, developed, form, in, his, textbook, a, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, in, 1873, most, of, this, work, was, done, by, maxwell, at, glenlair, during, the, period, between, holding, his, london, post, and, his, taking, up, the, cavendish, chair, oliver, heaviside, reduced, the, complexity, of, maxwell, s, theory, down, to, four, partial, differential, equations, known, now, collectively, as, maxwell, s, laws, or, maxwell, s, equations, although, potentials, became, much, less, popular, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, use, of, scalar, and, vector, potentials, is, now, standard, in, the, solution, of, maxwell, s, equations, as, barrett, and, grimes, 1995, describe, maxwell, expressed, electromagnetism, in, the, algebra, of, quaternions, and, made, the, electromagnetic, potential, the, centerpiece, of, his, theory, in, 1881, heaviside, replaced, the, electromagnetic, potential, field, by, force, fields, as, the, centerpiece, of, electromagnetic, theory, according, to, heaviside, the, electromagnetic, potential, field, was, arbitrary, and, needed, to, be, assassinated, sic, a, few, years, later, there, was, a, debate, between, heaviside, and, tate, sic, about, the, relative, merits, of, vector, analysis, and, quaternions, the, result, was, the, realization, that, there, was, no, need, for, the, greater, physical, insights, provided, by, quaternions, if, the, theory, was, purely, local, and, vector, analysis, became, commonplace, maxwell, was, proved, correct, and, his, quantitative, connection, between, light, and, electromagnetism, is, considered, one, of, the, great, accomplishments, of, 19th, century, mathematical, physics, maxwell, also, introduced, the, concept, of, the, electromagnetic, field, in, comparison, to, force, lines, that, faraday, described, by, understanding, the, propagation, of, electromagnetism, as, a, field, emitted, by, active, particles, maxwell, could, advance, his, work, on, light, at, that, time, maxwell, believed, that, the, propagation, of, light, required, a, medium, for, the, waves, dubbed, the, luminiferous, aether, over, time, the, existence, of, such, a, medium, permeating, all, space, and, yet, apparently, undetectable, by, mechanical, means, proved, impossible, to, reconcile, with, experiments, such, as, the, michelson, morley, experiment, moreover, it, seemed, to, require, an, absolute, frame, of, reference, in, which, the, equations, were, valid, with, the, distasteful, result, that, the, equations, changed, form, for, a, moving, observer, these, difficulties, inspired, albert, einstein, to, formulate, the, theory, of, special, relativity, in, the, process, einstein, dispensed, with, the, requirement, of, a, stationary, luminiferous, aether, along, with, most, physicists, of, the, time, maxwell, had, a, strong, interest, in, psychology, following, in, the, steps, of, isaac, newton, and, thomas, young, he, was, particularly, interested, in, the, study, of, colour, vision, from, 1855, to, 1872, maxwell, published, at, intervals, a, series, of, investigations, concerning, the, perception, of, colour, colour, blindness, and, colour, theory, and, was, awarded, the, rumford, medal, for, on, the, theory, of, colour, vision, isaac, newton, had, demonstrated, using, prisms, that, white, light, such, as, sunlight, is, composed, of, a, number, of, monochromatic, components, which, could, then, be, recombined, into, white, light, newton, also, showed, that, an, orange, paint, made, of, yellow, and, red, could, look, exactly, like, a, monochromatic, orange, light, although, being, composed, of, two, monochromatic, yellow, and, red, lights, hence, the, paradox, that, puzzled, physicists, of, the, time, two, complex, lights, composed, of, more, than, one, monochromatic, light, could, look, alike, but, be, physically, different, called, metameres, thomas, young, later, proposed, that, this, paradox, could, be, explained, by, colours, being, perceived, through, a, limited, number, of, channels, in, the, eyes, which, he, proposed, to, be, threefold, the, trichromatic, colour, theory, maxwell, used, the, recently, developed, linear, algebra, to, prove, young, s, theory, any, monochromatic, light, stimulating, three, receptors, should, be, able, to, be, equally, stimulated, by, a, set, of, three, different, monochromatic, lights, in, fact, by, any, set, of, three, different, lights, he, demonstrated, that, to, be, the, case, inventing, colour, matching, experiments, and, colourimetry, maxwell, was, also, interested, in, applying, his, theory, of, colour, perception, namely, in, colour, photography, stemming, directly, from, his, psychological, work, on, colour, perception, if, a, sum, of, any, three, lights, could, reproduce, any, perceivable, colour, then, colour, photographs, could, be, produced, with, a, set, of, three, coloured, filters, in, the, course, of, his, 1855, paper, maxwell, proposed, that, if, three, black, and, white, photographs, of, a, scene, were, taken, through, red, green, and, blue, filters, and, transparent, prints, of, the, images, were, projected, onto, a, screen, using, three, projectors, equipped, with, similar, filters, when, superimposed, on, the, screen, the, result, would, be, perceived, by, the, human, eye, as, a, complete, reproduction, of, all, the, colours, in, the, scene, during, an, 1861, royal, institution, lecture, on, colour, theory, maxwell, presented, the, world, s, first, demonstration, of, colour, photography, by, this, principle, of, three, colour, analysis, and, synthesis, thomas, sutton, inventor, of, the, single, lens, reflex, camera, took, the, picture, he, photographed, a, tartan, ribbon, three, times, through, red, green, and, blue, filters, also, making, a, fourth, photograph, through, a, yellow, filter, which, according, to, maxwell, s, account, was, not, used, in, the, demonstration, because, sutton, s, photographic, plates, were, insensitive, to, red, and, barely, sensitive, to, green, the, results, of, this, pioneering, experiment, were, far, from, perfect, it, was, remarked, in, the, published, account, of, the, lecture, that, if, the, red, and, green, images, had, been, as, fully, photographed, as, the, blue, it, would, have, been, a, truly, coloured, image, of, the, riband, by, finding, photographic, materials, more, sensitive, to, the, less, refrangible, rays, the, representation, of, the, colours, of, objects, might, be, greatly, improved, researchers, in, 1961, concluded, that, the, seemingly, impossible, partial, success, of, the, red, filtered, exposure, was, due, to, ultraviolet, light, which, is, strongly, reflected, by, some, red, dyes, not, entirely, blocked, by, the, red, filter, used, and, within, the, range, of, sensitivity, of, the, wet, collodion, process, sutton, employed, maxwell, also, investigated, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, originating, with, daniel, bernoulli, this, theory, was, advanced, by, the, successive, labours, of, john, herapath, john, james, waterston, james, joule, and, particularly, rudolf, clausius, to, such, an, extent, as, to, put, its, general, accuracy, beyond, a, doubt, but, it, received, enormous, development, from, maxwell, who, in, this, field, appeared, as, an, experimenter, on, the, laws, of, gaseous, friction, as, well, as, a, mathematician, between, 1859, and, 1866, he, developed, the, theory, of, the, distributions, of, velocities, in, particles, of, a, gas, work, later, generalised, by, ludwig, boltzmann, the, formula, called, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, gives, the, fraction, of, gas, molecules, moving, at, a, specified, velocity, at, any, given, temperature, in, the, kinetic, theory, temperatures, and, heat, involve, only, molecular, movement, this, approach, generalised, the, previously, established, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, explained, existing, observations, and, experiments, in, a, better, way, than, had, been, achieved, previously, his, work, on, thermodynamics, led, him, to, devise, the, thought, experiment, that, came, to, be, known, as, maxwell, s, demon, where, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, violated, by, an, imaginary, being, capable, of, sorting, particles, by, energy, in, 1871, he, established, maxwell, s, thermodynamic, relations, which, are, statements, of, equality, among, the, second, derivatives, of, the, thermodynamic, potentials, with, respect, to, different, thermodynamic, variables, in, 1874, he, constructed, a, plaster, thermodynamic, visualisation, as, a, way, of, exploring, phase, transitions, based, on, the, american, scientist, josiah, willard, gibbs, s, graphical, thermodynamics, papers, maxwell, published, the, paper, on, governors, in, the, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, vol, 16, 1867, 1868, this, paper, is, considered, a, central, paper, of, the, early, days, of, control, theory, here, governors, refers, to, the, governor, or, the, centrifugal, governor, used, to, regulate, steam, engines
