his, works, the, people, of, hems, 1887, and, among, french, peasants, 1889, were, influenced, by, his, study, of, rousseau, he, then, moved, to, germany, where, he, fell, in, love, with, chancellor,

strindberg, himself, was, experiencing, marital, problems, and, doubted, the, paternity, of, his, children, he, also, suspected, that, ibsen, had, based, hjalmar, ekdal, in, the, wild, duck, 1884, on, strindberg, because, he, felt, that, ibsen, viewed, him, as, a, weak, and, pathetic, husband, he, reworked, the, situation, of, ibsen, s, play, into, a, warfare, between, the, two, sexes, from,

encounter, that, crosses, the, division, of, social, classes, it, is, believed, that, this, play, was, inspired, by, the, marriage, of, strindberg, the, son, of, a, servant, to, an, aristocratic, woman, in, the, essay, on, psychic, murder, 1887, he, referred, to, the, psychological, theories, of, the, nancy, school, which, advocated, the, use, of, hypnosis, strindberg, developed, a, theory, that, sexual, warfare, was, not, motivated, by, carnal, desire, but, by, relentless, human, will, the, winner, was, the, one, who, had, the, strongest, and, most, unscrupulous, mind, someone, who, like, a, hypnotist, could, coerce, a, more, impressionable, psyche, into, submission, his, view, on, psychological, power, struggles, may, be, seen, in, works, such, as, creditors, 1889, the, stronger, 1889, and, pariah, 1889, in, 1888, after, a, separation, and, reconciliation, with, siri, von, essen, he, founded, the, scandinavian, experimental, theatre, in, copenhagen, where, siri,

reconciliation, short, lived, he, moved, back, to, sweden, while, siri, moved, back, to, her, native, finland, with, the, children, while, there, he, rode, out, the, final, phase, of, the, divorce, and, later, used, this, agonizing, ordeal, for, the, basis, of, the, bond, and, the, link, 1893, strindberg, also, became, interested, in, short, drama, called, quart, d, heure, he, was, inspired, by, writers, such, as, gustave, guiche, and, henri, de, lavedan, his, notable, contribution, was, the, stronger, 1889, as, a, result, of, the, failure, of, the, scandinavian, experimental, theatre, strindberg, did, not, work, as, a, playwright, for, three, years, in, 1889, he, published, an, essay, entitled, on, modern, drama, and, the, modern, theatre, in, which, he, disassociated, himself, from, naturalism, arguing, that, it, was, petty, and, unimaginative, realism, his, sympathy, for, nietzsche, s, philosophy, and, atheism, in, general, was, also, on, the, wane, he, entered, the, period, of, his, inferno, crisis, in, which, he, had, psychological, and, religious, upheavals, that, influenced, his, later, works, august, strindberg, s, inferno, is, his, personal, account, of, sinking, deeper, into, some, kind, of, madness, typified, by, visions, and, paranoia, in, strindberg, och, alkoholen, 1985, james, spens, discusses, strindberg, s, drinking, habits, including, his,

friend, the, danish, woman, marie, caroline, david, on, the, island, runmar, in, the, stockholm, archipelago, strindberg, suspected, von, essen, was, having, a, long, term, affair, with, david, and, he, violently, assaulted, her, precipitating, the, end, of, the, marriage, after, his, disenchantment, with, naturalism, strindberg, had, a, growing, interest, in, transcendental, matters, symbolism, was, just, beginning, at, this, time, verner, von, heidenstam, and, ola, hanson, had, dismissed, naturalism, as, shoemaker, realism, that, rendered, human, experience, in, simplistic, terms, this, is, believed, to, have, stalled, strindberg, s, creativity, and, strindberg, insisted, that, he, was, in, a, rivalry, and, forced, to, defend, naturalism, even, though, he, had, exhausted, its, literary, potential, these, works, include, debit, and, credit, 1892, facing, death, 1892, motherly, love, 1892, and, the, first, warning, 1893, his, play, the, keys, of, heaven, 1892, was, inspired, by, the, loss, of, his, children, in, his, divorce, he, also, completed, one, of, his, few, comedies, playing, with, fire, 1893, and, the, first, two, parts, of, his, post, inferno, trilogy, to, damascus, 1898, 1904, in, 1892, he, experienced, writer, s, block, which, led, to, a, drastic, reduction, in, his, income, depression, followed, as, he, was, unable, to, meet, his, financial, obligations, and, to, support, his, children, and, former, wife, a, fund, was, set, up, through, an, appeal, in, a, german, magazine, this, money, allowed, him, to, leave, sweden, and, he, joined, artistic, circles, in, berlin, otto, brahm, s, freie, b, hne, theatre, premiered, some, of, his, famous, works, in, germany, including, the, father, miss, julie, and, creditors, similar, to, twenty, years, earlier, when, he, frequented, the, red, room, he, now, went, to, the, german, tavern, the, black, porker, here, he, met, a, diverse, group, of, artists, from, scandinavia, poland, and, germany, his, attention, turned, to, frida, uhl, who, was, twenty, three, years, younger, than, strindberg, they, were, married, in, 1893, less, than, a, year, later, their, daughter, kerstin, was, born, and, the, couple, separated, though, their, marriage, was, not, officially, dissolved, until, 1897, frida, s, family, in, particular, her, mother, who, was, a, devout, catholic, had, an, important, influence, on, strindberg, and, in, an, 1894, letter, he, declared, i, feel, the, hand, of, our, lord, resting, over, me, some, critics, think, that, strindberg, suffered, from, severe, paranoia, in, the, mid, 1890s, and, perhaps, that, he, temporarily, experienced, insanity, others, including, evert, sprinchorn, and, olof, lagercrantz, believed, that, he, intentionally, turned, himself, into, his, own, guinea, pig, by, doing, psychological, and, drug, induced, self, experimentation, he, wrote, on, subjects, such, as, botany, chemistry, and, optics, before, returning, to, literature, with, the, publication, of, inferno, 1897, a, half, fictionalized, account, of, his, wilderness, years, in, austria, and, paris, then, a, collection, of, short, stories, legends, and, a, semi, dramatic, novella, jacob, wrestling, both, printed, in, the, same, book, 1898, both, volumes, aroused, curiosity, and, controversy, not, least, due, to, the, religious, element, earlier, strindberg, had, been, known, to, be, indifferent, or, hostile, to, religion, and, especially, priests, but, now, he, had, undergone, some, sort, of, conversion, to, a, personal, faith, in, a, postscript, he, noted, the, impact, of, emanuel, swedenborg, on, his, current, work, the, powers, were, central, to, strindberg, s, later, work, he, said, that, the, powers, were, an, outside, force, that, had, caused, him, his, physical, and, mental, suffering, because, they, were, acting, in, retribution, to, humankind, for, their, wrongdoings, as, william, blake, ralph, waldo, emerson, honor, de, balzac, and, william, butler, yeats, had, been, he, was, drawn, to, swedenborg, s, mystical, visions, with, their, depictions, of, spiritual, landscape, and, christian, morality, strindberg, believed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, that, the, relationship, between, the, transcendental, and, the, real, world, was, described, by, a, series, of, correspondences, and, that, everyday, events, were, really, messages, from, above, of, which, only, the, enlightened, could, make, sense, he, also, felt, that, he, was, chosen, by, providence, to, atone, for, the, moral, decay, of, others, and, that, his, tribulations, were, payback, for, misdeeds, earlier, in, his, life, strindberg, had, spent, the, tail, end, of, 1896, and, most, of, 1897, in, the, university, town, of, lund, in, southern, sweden, a, sojourn, during, which, he, made, a, number, of, new, friendships, felt, his, mental, stability, and, health, improving, and, also, firmly, returned, to, literary, writing, inferno, legends, and, jacob, wrestling, were, written, there, in, 1899, he, returned, permanently, to, stockholm, following, a, successful, production, there, of, master, olof, in, 1897, which, was, re, staged, in, 1899, to, mark, strindberg, s, fiftieth, birthday, he, had, the, desire, to, become, recognized, as, a, lead, ng, figure, in, swedish, literature, and, to, put, earlier, controversies, behind, him, and, felt, that, historical, dramas, were, the, way, to, attain, that, status, though, strindberg, claimed, that, he, was, writing, realistically, he, freely, altered, past, events, and, biographical, information, and, telescoped, chronology, as, often, done, in, most, historical, fiction, more, importantly, he, felt, a, flow, of, resurgent, inspiration, writing, almost, twenty, new, plays, many, in, a, historical, setting, between, 1898, and, 1902, his, new, works, included, the, so, called, vasa, trilogy, the, saga, of, the, folkungs, 1899, gustavus, vasa, 1899, and, erik, xiv, 1899, and, a, dream, play, written, in, 1901, first, performed, in, 1907, strindberg, was, pivotal, in, the, creation, of, chamber, plays, max, reinhardt, was, a, big, supporter, of, his, staging, some, of, his, plays, at, the, kleines, theatre, in, 1902, including, the, bond, the, stronger, and, the, outlaw, once, otto, brahm, relinquished, his, role, as, head, as, of, the, deutsches, theatre, reinhardt, took, over, and, produced, strindberg, s, plays, in, 1903, strindberg, planned, to, write, a, grand, cycle, of, plays, based, on, world, history, but, the, idea, soon, faded, he, had, completed, short, plays, about, martin, luther, plato, moses, jesus, christ, and, socrates, he, wrote, another, historical, drama, in, 1908, after, the, royal, theatre, convinced, him, to, put, on, a, new, play, for, its, sixtieth, birthday, he, wrote, the, last, of, the, knights, 1908, earl, birger, of, bjalbo, 1909, and, the, regents, 1909, his, other, works, such, as, days, of, loneliness, 1903, the, roofing, ceremony, 1907, and, the, scapegoat, 1907, and, the, novels, the, gothic, rooms, 1904, and, black, banners, genre, scenes, from, the, turn, of, the, century, 1907, have, been, viewed, as, precursors, to, marcel, proust, and, franz, kafka, august, falck, an, actor, wanted, to, put, on, a, production, of, miss, julie, and, wrote, to, strindberg, for, permission, in, september, 1906, he, staged, the, first, swedish, production, of, miss, julie, august, falck, played, jean, and, manda, bjorling, played, julie, in, 1909, strindberg, thought, he, might, get, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, but, instead, lost, to, selma, lagerl, f, the, first, woman, and, first, swede, to, win, the, award, the, leader, of, the, social, democrat, youth, alliance, started, a, fund, raiser, for, a, special, people, s, award, nathan, s, derblom, friend, of, strindberg, since, the, mid, 90s, years, in, paris, a, prominent, theologian, and, later, to, become, archbishop, of, sweden, was, noted, as, a, donor, and, both, he, and, strindberg, came, under, attack, from, circles, close, to, the, conservative, party, and, the, church, in, total, 45, 000, swedish, crowns, were, collected, by, more, than, 20, 000, donors, most, of, whom, were, workers, albert, bonniers, f, rlag, who, had, already, published, much, of, his, work, over, the, years, paid, him, 200, 000, swedish, crowns, for, the, publishing, rights, to, his, complete, works, the, first, volumes, of, the, edition, would, appear, in, print, in, 1912, a, few, months, before, his, death, he, invited, his, first, three, children, now, like, their, mother, living, in, finland, to, stockholm, and, divided, the, money, into, five, shares, one, for, each, child, one, for, siri, absent, and, the, last, one, for, himself, in, setting, apart, one, share, for, siri, strindberg, noted, in, a, shy, voice, this, is, for, your, mother, it, s, to, settle, an, old, debt, when, the, children, returned, to, helsinki, siri, was, surprised, to, hear, that, she, had, been, included, but, accepted, the, money, and, told, them, in, a, voice, that, was, according, to, her, daughter, karin, both, proud, and, moved, i, shall, accept, it, receiving, it, as, an, old, debt, the, debt, was, less, financial, than, mental, and, emotional, strindberg, knew, he, had, sometimes, treated, her, unfairly, during, the, later, years, of, their, marriage, and, at, their, divorce, trial, in, 1912, she, would, pass, away, only, a, few, weeks, before, him, in, 1907, strindberg, co, founded, the, intimate, theatre, in, stockholm, together, with, the, young, actor, and, stage, director, august, falck, his, theatre, was, modeled, after, max, reinhardt, s, kammerspiel, haus, strindberg, and, falck, had, the, intention, of, the, theatre, being, used, for, his, plays, and, his, plays, only, strindberg, also, wanted, to, try, out, a, more, chamber, oriented, and, sparse, style, of, dramatic, writing, and, production, in, time, for, the, theatre, s, opening, strindberg, wrote, four, chamber, plays, thunder, in, the, air, the, burned, site, the, ghost, sonata, and, the, pelican, these, were, generally, not, a, success, with, audiences, or, newspaper, critics, at, the, time, but, have, been, highly, influential, on, modern, drama, and, soon, would, reach, wider, audiences, at, reinhardt, s, theatre, in, berlin, and, other, german, stages, strindberg, had, very, specific, ideas, about, how, the, theatre, would, be, opened, and, operated, he, drafted, a, series, of, rules, for, his, theatre, in, a, letter, to, august, falck, 1, no, liquor, 2, no, sunday, performances, 3, short, performances, without, intermissions, 4, no, calls, 5, only, 160, seats, in, the, auditorium, 6, no, prompter, no, orchestra, only, music, on, stage, 7, the, text, will, be, sold, at, the, box, office, and, in, the, lobby, 8, summer, performances, falck, helped, to, design, the, auditorium, which, was, decorated, in, a, deep, green, tone, the, ceiling, lighting, was, a, yellow, silk, cover, which, created, an, effect, of, mild, daylight, the, floor, was, covered, with, a, deep, green, carpet, and, the, auditorium, was, decorated, by, six, ultra, modern, columns, with, elaborate, up, to, date, capitals, instead, of, the, usual, restaurant, strindberg, offered, a, lounge, for, the, ladies, and, a, smoking, room, for, the, gentlemen, the, stage, was, unusually, small, only, 6, by, 9, metres, the, small, stage, and, minimal, number, of, seats, was, meant, to, give, the, audience, a, greater, feeling, of, involvement, in, the, work, unlike, most, theatres, at, this, time, the, intima, teater, was, not, a, place, in, which, people, could, come, to, socialize, by, setting, up, his, rules, and, creating, an, intimate, atmosphere, strindberg, was, able, to, demand, the, audience, s, focus, when, the, theatre, opened, in, 1907, with, a, performance, of, the, pelican, it, was, a, rather, large, hit, strindberg, used, a, minimal, technique, as, was, his, way, by, only, having, a, back, drop, and, some, sea, shells, on, the, stage, for, scene, design, and, props, strindberg, was, much, more, concerned, with, the, actors, portraying, the, written, word, than, the, stage, looking, pretty, the, theatre, ran, into, a, financial, difficulty, in, february, 1908, and, falck, had, to, borrow, money, from, prince, eugen, duke, of, n, rke, who, attended, the, premi, re, of, the, pelican, the, theatre, eventually, went, bankrupt, in, 1910, but, did, not, close, until, strindberg, s, death, in, 1912, the, newspapers, wrote, about, the, theatre, until, its, death, strindberg, died, shortly, after, the, first, staging, of, one, of, his, plays, in, the, united, states, the, father, opened, on, 9, april, 1912, at, the, berkeley, theatre, in, new, york, in, a, translation, by, painter, and, playwright, edith, gardener, shearn, oland, and, her, husband, actor, warner, oland, they, jointly, published, their, translations, of, his, plays, in, book, form, in, 1912, during, christmas, 1911, strindberg, became, sick, with, pneumonia, and, he, never, recovered, completely, he, also, began, to, suffer, more, clearly, from, a, stomach, cancer, early, signs, of, which, had, been, felt, in, 1908, the, final, weeks, of, his, life, were, painful, he, had, long, since, become, a, national, celebrity, even, if, highly, controversial, and, when, it, became, clear, that, he, was, seriously, ill, the, daily, papers, in, stockholm, began, reporting, on, his, health, in, every, edition, he, received, many, letters, and, telegrams, from, admirers, across, the, country, he, died, on, 14, may, 1912, at, the, age, of, 63, strindberg, was, interred, at, norra, begravningsplatsen, in, stockholm, he, had, given, strict, instructions, concerning, his, funeral, and, how, his, body, should, be, treated, after, death, only, members, of, his, immediate, family, were, allowed, to, view, his, body, there, would, be, no, autopsy, no, photographs, were, taken, and, no, death, mask, was, made, strindberg, had, also, requested, that, his, funeral, should, take, place, as, soon, as, possible, after, his, death, to, avoid, crowds, of, onlookers, however, the, workers, organisations, requested, that, the, funeral, should, take, place, on, a, sunday, to, make, it, possible, for, working, men, to, pay, their, respects, and, the, funeral, was, postponed, for, five, days, until, sunday, 19, may, according, to, strindberg, s, last, wish, the, funeral, procession, was, to, start, at, 8am, again, to, avoid, crowds, but, large, groups, of, people, were, nevertheless, waiting, outside, his, home, as, well, as, at, the, cemetery, as, early, as, 7am, a, short, service, was, conducted, by, nathan, s, derblom, by, the, bier, in, strindberg, s, home, in, the, presence, of, three, of, strindberg, s, children, and, his, housekeeper, after, which, the, coffin, was, taken, outside, for, the, funeral, procession, the, procession, was, followed, by, groups, of, students, workers, members, of, parliament, and, a, couple, of, cabinet, ministers, and, it, was, estimated, that, up, to, 60, 000, people, lined, the, streets, king, gustaf, v, sent, a, wreath, for, the, bier, tennessee, williams, edward, albee, maxim, gorky, john, osborne, and, ingmar, bergman, are, among, the, many, artists, who, have, cited, strindberg, as, an, influence, eugene, o, neill, upon, receiving, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, dedicated, much, of, his, acceptance, speech, to, describing, strindberg, s, influence, on, his, work, and, referred, to, him, as, that, greatest, genius, of, all, modern, dramatists, argentinian, writer, jorge, luis, borges, said, of, strindberg, was, for, a, time, my, god, alongside, nietzsche, a, multi, faceted, author, strindberg, was, often, extreme, his, novel, the, red, room, 1879, made, him, famous, his, early, plays, belong, to, the, naturalistic, movement, his, works, from, this, time, are, often, compared, with, the, norwegian, playwright, henrik, ibsen, strindberg, s, best, known, play, from, this, period, is, miss, julie, among, his, most, widely, read, works, is, the, novel, the, people, of, hems, strindberg, wanted, to, attain, what, he, called, greater, naturalism, he, disliked, the, expository, character, backgrounds, that, characterise, the, work, of, henrik, ibsen, and, rejected, the, convention, of, a, dramatic, slice, of, life, because, he, felt, that, the, resulting, plays, were, mundane, and, uninteresting, strindberg, felt, that, true, naturalism, was, a, psychological, battle, of, brains, two, people, who, hate, each, other, in, the, immediate, moment, and, strive, to, drive, the, other, to, doom, is, the, type, of, mental, hostility, that, strindberg, strove, to, describe, he, intended, his, plays, to, be, impartial, and, objective, citing, a, desire, to, make, literature, akin, to, a, science, following, the, inner, turmoil, that, he, experienced, during, the, inferno, crisis, he, wrote, an, important, book, in, french, inferno, 1896, 7, in, which, he, dramatised, his, experiences, he, also, exchanged, a, few, cryptic, letters, with, friedrich, nietzsche, strindberg, subsequently, ended, his, association, with, naturalism, and, began, to, produce, works, informed, by, symbolism, he, is, considered, one, of, the, pioneers, of, the, modern, european, stage, and, expressionism, the, dance, of, death, a, dream, play, and, the, ghost, sonata, are, well, known, plays, from, this, period, his, most, famous, and, produced, plays, are, master, olof, miss, julie, and, the, father, internationally, strindberg, is, chiefly, remembered, as, a, playwright, but, in, his, native, sweden, his, name, is, associated, no, less, with, novels, and, other, writings, r, da, rummet, the, red, room, hems, borna, the, people, of, hems, giftas, getting, married, en, d, res, f, rsvarstal, the, confession, of, a, fool, and, inferno, remain, among, his, most, celebrated, novels, representing, different, genres, and, styles, he, is, often, though, not, universally, viewed, as, sweden, s, greatest, author, and, taught, in, schools, as, a, key, figure, of, swedish, culture, the, most, important, contemporary, literary, award, in, sweden, augustpriset, is, named, for, strindberg, the, swedish, composer, ture, rangstr, m, dedicated, his, first, symphony, which, was, finished, in, 1914, to, august, strindberg, in, memoriam, an, acerbic, polemicist, who, was, often, vehemently, opposed, to, conventional, authority, strindberg, was, difficult, to, pigeon, hole, as, a, political, figure, through, his, long, career, he, penned, scathing, attacks, on, the, military, the, church, and, the, monarchy, for, most, of, his, public, life, he, was, seen, as, a, major, figure, on, the, literary, left, and, a, standard, bearer, of, cultural, radicalism, but, especially, from, the, 1890s, he, espoused, conservative, and, religious, views, that, alienated, many, former, supporters, he, resumed, his, attacks, on, conservative, society, with, great, vigor, in, the, years, immediately, preceding, his, death, strindberg, s, opinions, were, typically, stated, with, great, force, and, vitriol, and, sometimes, humorously, over, stated, he, was, involved, in, a, variety, of, crises, and, feuds, skirmishing, regularly, with, the, literary, and, cultural, establishment, of, his, day, including, erstwhile, allies, and, friends, his, youthful, reputation, as, a, genial, enfant, terrible, of, swedish, literature, transformed, eventually, into, the, role, of, a, sort, of, ill, tempered, towering, giant, of, swedish, public, life, strindberg, was, a, prolific, letter, writer, whose, private, communications, have, been, collected, in, several, annotated, volumes, he, often, voiced, political, views, privately, to, friends, and, literary, acquaintances, phrased, in, a, no, holds, barred, jargon, of, scathing, attacks, drastic, humor, and, flippant, hyperbole, many, of, his, most, controversial, political, statements, are, drawn, from, this, private, correspondence, influenced, by, the, history, of, the, 1871, paris, commune, the, young, strindberg, had, embraced, the, view, that, politics, was, the, art, of, the, upper, class, to, keep, the, lower, class, under, itself, early, works, like, the, red, room, or, master, olof, took, aim, at, public, hypocrisy, royalty, and, organized, religion, he, was, at, this, time, an, outspoken, socialist, mainly, influenced, by, anarchist, or, libertarian, socialist, ideas, however, strindberg, s, socialism, was, undogmatic, and, rooted, in, a, ruthless, critique, of, state, church, school, press, and, economy, in, which, he, aimed, at, pitting, the, people, against, kings, economists, priests, and, merchants, a, small, example, from, this, period, is, his, little, catechism, for, the, underclass, he, read, widely, among, progressive, thinkers, including, cabet, fourier, babeuf, saint, simon, proudhon, and, owen, whom, he, referred, to, as, friends, of, humanity, and, sharp, thinkers, strindberg, adopted, ideas, from, everyone, writes, jan, olsson, who, notes, that, strindberg, lived, in, a, period, where, terms, like, anarchism, socialism, and, communism, were, alternately, used, as, synonyms, and, as, different, terms, by, the, early, 1880s, many, young, political, and, literary, radicals, in, sweden, had, come, to, view, strindberg, as, a, champion, of, their, causes, however, in, contrast, to, the, marxist, influenced, socialism, then, rising, within, the, swedish, labor, movement, strindberg, espoused, an, older, type, of, agrarian, radicalism, accompanied, by, spiritual, and, even, mystical, ideas, his, views, remained, as, fluid, and, eclectic, as, they, were, uncompromising, and, on, certain, issues, he, could, be, wildly, out, of, step, with, the, younger, generation, of, socialists, to, martin, kylhammar, the, young, strindberg, was, a, reactionary, radical, whose, writing, was, populist, and, democratic, but, who, persisted, in, an, antiquated, romanticizing, of, agrarian, life, although, he, had, been, an, early, proponent, of, women, s, rights, calling, for, women, s, suffrage, in, 1884, strindberg, later, became, disenchanted, with, what, he, viewed, as, an, unnatural, equation, of, the, sexes, in, times, of, personal, conflict, and, marital, trouble, which, was, much, of, the, time, he, could, lash, out, with, crudely, misogynistic, statements, his, troubled, marriage, with, siri, von, essen, ended, in, an, upsetting, divorce, in, 1891, became, the, inspiration, for, the, defence, of, a, fool, begun, in, 1887, and, published, in, 1893, strindberg, famously, sought, to, insert, a, warning, to, lawmakers, against, granting, citizens, rights, to, half, apes, lower, beings, sick, children, sick, and, crazed, thirteen, times, a, year, during, their, periods, completely, insane, while, pregnant, and, irresponsible, throughout, the, rest, of, their, lives, the, paragraph, was, ultimately, removed, before, printing, by, his, publisher, strindberg, s, misogyny, was, at, odds, with, the, younger, generation, of, socialist, activists, and, has, drawn, attention, in, contemporary, strindberg, scholarship, so, has, strindberg, s, anti, jewish, rhetoric, although, particularly, targeting, jewish, enemies, of, his, in, swedish, cultural, life, he, also, attacked, jews, and, judaism, as, such, the, antisemitic, outbursts, were, particularly, pronounced, in, the, early, 1880s, when, strindberg, dedicated, an, entire, chapter, moses, in, a, work, of, social, and, political, satire, det, nya, riket, dedicated, to, heckling, swedish, jews, including, an, unflattering, portrayal, of, albert, bonnier, although, anti, jewish, prejudice, was, far, from, uncommon, in, wider, society, in, the, 1880s, jan, myrdal, notes, that, the, entire, liberal, and, democratic, intelligentsia, of, the, time, distanced, themselves, from, the, older, left, wing, antisemitism, of, august, strindberg, yet, as, with, many, things, strindberg, s, opinions, and, passions, shifted, with, time, in, the, mid, 1880s, he, toned, down, and, then, mostly, ended, his, anti, jewish, rhetoric, after, publicly, declaring, himself, not, to, be, an, anti, semite, in, 1884, a, self, declared, atheist, in, his, younger, years, strindberg, would, also, re, embrace, christianity, without, necessarily, making, his, peace, with, the, church, as, noted, by, stockholm, s, strindberg, museum, the, personal, and, spiritual, crisis, that, strindberg, underwent, in, paris, in, the, 1890s, which, prompted, the, writing, of, inferno, had, aesthetic, as, well, as, philosophical, and, political, implications, before, the, inferno, crisis, 1869, 92, strindberg, was, influenced, by, anarchism, rousseau, schopenhauer, and, nietzsche, in, the, years, after, the, crisis, 1897, 1911, he, was, influenced, by, swedenborg, goethe, shakespeare, and, beethoven, in, inferno, strindberg, notes, his, ideological, and, spiritual, evolution, what, is, the, purpose, of,

made, me, a, free, thinker, out, of, a, free, thinker, you, have, made, me, an, atheist, out, of, an, atheist, a, religious, believer, inspired, by, humanitarian, ideas, i, have, praised, socialism, five, years, later, you, have, proven, to, me, the, unreasonableness, of, socialism, everything, that, once, enthralled, me, you, have, invalidated, and, presuming, that, i, will, now, abandon, myself, to, religion, i, am, certain, that, you, will, in, ten, years, disprove, religion, strindberg, inferno, chapter, xv, despite, his, reactionary, attitudes, on, issues, such, as, women, s, rights, and, his, conservative, mystical, turn, from, the, early, 1890s, strindberg, remained, popular, with, some, in, the, socialist, liberal, camp, on, the, strength, of, his, past, radicalism, and, his, continued, salience, as, a, literary, modernizer, however, several, former, admirers, were, disappointed, and, troubled, by, what, they, viewed, as, strindberg, s, descent, into, religious, conservatism, and, perhaps, madness, his, former, ally, and, friend, social, democrat, leader, hjalmar, branting, now, dismissed, the, author, as, a, disaster, who, had, betrayed, his, past, ideals, for, a, reactionary, mystical, elitism, in, 1909, branting, remarked, on, strindberg, s, shifting, political, and, cultural, posture, on, the, occasion, of, the, author, s, sixtieth, birthday, to, the, young, strindberg, the, trail, blazer, the, rouser, from, sleep, let, us, offer, all, our, praise, and, admiration, to, the, writer, in, a, more, mature, age, a, place, of, rank, on, the, aeropagus, of, european, erudition, but, to, the, strindberg, of, black, banners, and, a, blue, book, who, in, the, shadows, of, inferno, has, been, converted, to, a, belief, in, the, sickly, empty, gospels, of, mysticism, let, us, wish, from, our, hearts, that, he, may, once, again, become, his, past, self, hjalmar, branting, in, social, demokraten, 22, january, 1909, toward, the, end, of, his, life, however, strindberg, would, dramatically, reassert, his, role, as, a, radical, standard, bearer, and, return, to, the, good, graces, of, progressive, swedish, opinion, in, april, 1910, strindberg, launched, a, series, of, unprompted, insult, laden, attacks, on, popular, conservative, symbols, viciously, thrashing, the, nationalist, cult, of, former, king, charles, xii, pharao, worship, the, lauded, poet, verner, von, heidenstam, the, spirit, seer, of, djursholm, and, the, famous, author, and, traveler, sven, hedin, the, humbug, explorer, the, ensuing, debate, known, as, strindbergsfejden, or, the, strindberg, feud, is, one, of, the, most, significant, literary, debates, in, swedish, history, it, came, to, comprise, about, a, thousand, articles, by, various, authors, across, some, eighty, newspapers, raging, for, two, years, until, strindberg, s, death, in, 1912, the, feud, served, to, revive, strindberg, s, reputation, as, an, implacable, enemy, of, bourgeois, tastes, while, also, reestablishing, beyond, doubt, his, centrality, to, swedish, culture, and, politics, in, 1912, strindberg, s, funeral, was, co, organized, by, branting, and, heavily, attended, by, members, of, the, swedish, labor, movement, with, more, than, 100, red, banners, in, attendance, alongside, the, entire, social, democrat, parliamentary, contingent, strindberg, s, daughter, karin, strindberg, married, a, russian, bolshevik, of, partially, swedish, ancestry, vladimir, smirnov, paulsson, strindberg, something, of, a, polymath, was, also, a, telegrapher, theosophist, painter, photographer, and, alchemist, painting, and, photography, offered, vehicles, for, his, belief, that, chance, played, a, crucial, part, in, the, creative, process, strindberg, s, paintings, were, unique, for, their, time, and, went, beyond, those, of, his, contemporaries, for, their, radical, lack, of, adherence, to, visual, reality, the, 117, paintings, that, are, acknowledged, as, his, were, mostly, painted, within, the, span, of, a, few, years, and, are, now, seen, by, some, as, among, the, most, original, works, of, 19th, century, art, today, his, best, known, pieces, are, stormy, expressionist, seascapes, selling, at, high, prices, in, auction, houses, though, strindberg, was, friends, with, edvard, munch, and, paul, gauguin, and, was, thus, familiar, with, modern, trends, the, spontaneous, and, subjective, expressiveness, of, his, landscapes, and, seascapes, can, be, ascribed, also, to, the, fact, that, he, painted, only, in, periods, of, personal, crisis, anders, zorn, also, did, a, portrait, strindberg, s, interest, in, photography, resulted, among, other, things, in, a, large, number, of, arranged, self, portraits, in, various, environments, which, now, number, among, the, best, known, pictures, of, him, strindberg, also, embarked, on, a, series, of, camera, less, images, using, an, experimental, quasi, scientific, approach, he, produced, a, type, of, photogram, that, encouraged, the, development, and, growth, of, crystals, on, the, photographic, emulsion, sometimes, exposed, for, lengthy, periods, to, heat, or, cold, in, the, open, air, or, at, night, facing, the, stars, the, suggestiveness, of, these, which, he, called, celestographs, provided, an, object, for, contemplation, and, he, noted, today, in, these, days, of, x, rays, the, miracle, was, that, neither, a, camera, nor, a, lens, was, used, for, me, this, means, a, great, opportunity, to, demonstrate, the, real, circumstances, by, means, of, my, photographs, made, without, a, camera, and, lens, recording, the, firmament, in, early, spring, 1894, his, interest, in, the, occult, in, the, 1890s, finds, sympathy, with, the, chance, quality, of, these, images, but, for, him, they, are, also, scientific, in, 1895, strindberg, met, camille, flammarion, and, became, a, member, of, the, soci, t, astronomique, de, france, he, gave, some, of, his, experimental, astronomical, photographs, to, the, society, alchemy, occultism, swedenborgianism, and, various, other, eccentric, interests, were, pursued, by, strindberg, with, some, intensity, for, periods, of, his, life, in, the, curious, and, experimental, 1897, work, inferno, a, dark, paranoid, and, confusing, tale, of, his, time, in, paris, written, in, french, which, takes, the, form, of, an, autobiographical, journal, strindberg, as, the, narrator, claims, to, have, successfully, performed, alchemical, experiments, and, cast, black, magic, spells, on, his, daughter, much, of, inferno, indicates, that, the, author, suffered, from, paranoid, delusions, as, he, writes, of, being, stalked, through, paris, haunted, by, evil, forces, and, targeted, with, mind, altering, electric, rays, emitted, by, an, infernal, machine, covertly, installed, in, his, hotel, it, remains, unclear, to, what, extent, the, book, represents, a, genuine, attempt, at, autobiography, or, exaggerates, for, literary, effect, olof, lagercrantz, has, suggested, that, strindberg, staged, and, imagined, elements, of, the, crisis, as, material, for, his, literary, production, strindberg, was, married, three, times, as, follows, strindberg, was, age, 28, and, siri, was, 27, at, the, time, of, their, marriage, he, was, 44, and, frida, was, 21, when, they, married, and, he, was, 52, and, harriet, was, 23, when, they,

last, years, but, the, exact, nature, of, their, relationship, is, debated, he, had, a, brief, affair, in, berlin, with, dagny, juel, before, his, marriage, to, frida, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, news, of, her, murder, in, 1901, was, the, reason, he, cancelled, his, honeymoon, with, his, third, wife, harriet, he, was, related, to, nils, strindberg, a, son, of, one, of, august, s, cousins,

stress, in, strindberg, s, lifetime, as, sweden, industrialized, and, urbanized, at, a, rapid, pace, problems, of, prostitution, and, poverty, were, debated, among, writers, critics, and, politicians, his, early, writing, often, dealt, with, the, traditional, roles, of, the, sexes, imposed, by, society, which, he, criticized, as, unjust, strindberg, s, last, home, was, bl, tornet, in, central, stockholm, where, he, lived, from, 1908, until, 1912, it, is, now, a, museum, known, as, the, strindberg, museum, which, is, open, to, visitors, it, contains, numerous, of, strindberg, s, personal,
