homer, h, o, m, r, ancient, greek, h, m, ros, born, c, 8th, century, bce, was, an, ancient, greek, poet, who, is, credited, as, the, author, of, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, two, epic, poems, that, are, foundational, works, of, ancient, greek, literature, homer, is, considered, one, of, the, most, revered, and, influential, authors, in, history, homer, s, iliad, centers, on, a, quarrel, between, king, agamemnon, and, the, warrior, achilles, during, the, last, year, of, the, trojan, war, the, odyssey, chronicles, the, ten, year, journey, of, odysseus, king, of, ithaca, back, to, his, home, after, the, fall, of, troy, the, poems, are, in, homeric, greek, also, known, as, epic, greek, a, literary, language, which, shows, a, mixture, of, features, of, the, ionic, and, aeolic, dialects, from, different, centuries, the, predominant, influence, is, eastern, ionic, most, researchers, believe, that, the, poems, were, originally, transmitted, orally, despite, being, predominantly, known, for, its, tragic, and, serious, themes, the, homeric, poems, also, contain, instances, of, comedy, and, laughter, homer, s, epic, poems, shaped, aspects, of, ancient, greek, culture, and, education, fostering, ideals, of, heroism, glory, and, honor, to, plato, homer, was, simply, the, one, who, has, taught, greece, t, n, hell, da, pepa, deuken, in, dante, alighieri, s, divine, comedy, virgil, refers, to, homer, as, poet, sovereign, king, of, all, poets, in, the, preface, to, his, translation, of, the, iliad, alexander, pope, acknowledges, that, homer, has, always, been, considered, the, greatest, of, poets, from, antiquity, to, the, present, day, homeric, epics, have, inspired, many, famous, works, of, literature, music, art, and, film, the, question, of, by, whom, when, where, and, under, what, circumstances, the, iliad, and, odyssey, were, composed, continues, to, be, debated, scholars, generally, regard, the, two, poems, as, the, works, of, separate, authors, it, is, thought, that, the, poems, were, composed, at, some, point, around, the, late, eighth, or, early, seventh, century, bce, many, accounts, of, homer, s, life, circulated, in, classical, antiquity, the, most, widespread, that, he, was, a, blind, bard, from, ionia, a, region, of, central, coastal, anatolia, in, present, day, turkey, modern, scholars, consider, these, accounts, legendary, today, only, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, are, associated, with, the, name, homer, in, antiquity, a, large, number, of, other, works, were, sometimes, attributed, to, him, including, the, homeric, hymns, the, contest, of, homer, and, hesiod, several, epigrams, the, little, iliad, the, nostoi, the, thebaid, the, cypria, the, epigoni, the, comic, mini, epic, batrachomyomachia, the, frog, mouse, war, the, margites, the, capture, of, oechalia, and, the, phocais, these, claims, are, not, considered, authentic, today, and, were, by, no, means, universally, accepted, in, the, ancient, world, as, with, the, multitude, of, legends, surrounding, homer, s, life, they, indicate, little, more, than, the, centrality, of, homer, to, ancient, greek, culture, some, ancient, accounts, about, homer, were, established, early, and, repeated, often, they, include, that, homer, was, blind, taking, as, self, referential, a, passage, describing, the, blind, bard, demodocus, that, he, resided, at, chios, that, he, was, the, son, of, the, river, meles, and, the, nymph, crithe, s, that, he, was, a, wandering, bard, that, he, composed, a, varying, list, of, other, works, the, homerica, that, he, died, either, in, ios, or, after, failing, to, solve, a, riddle, set, by, fishermen, and, various, explanations, for, the, name, homer, h, m, ros, another, tradition, from, the, days, of, the, roman, emperor, hadrian, says, epicaste, daughter, of, nestor, and, telemachus, son, of, odysseus, were, the, parents, of, homer, the, two, best, known, ancient, biographies, of, homer, are, the, life, of, homer, by, the, pseudo, herodotus, and, the, contest, of, homer, and, hesiod, in, the, early, fourth, century, bc, alcidamas, composed, a, fictional, account, of, a, poetry, contest, at, chalcis, with, both, homer, and, hesiod, homer, was, expected, to, win, and, answered, all, of, hesiod, s, questions, and, puzzles, with, ease, then, each, of, the, poets, was, invited, to, recite, the, best, passage, from, their, work, hesiod, selected, the, beginning, of, works, and, days, when, the, pleiades, born, of, atlas, all, in, due, season, homer, chose, a, description, of, greek, warriors, in, formation, facing, the, foe, taken, from, the, iliad, though, the, crowd, acclaimed, homer, victor, the, judge, awarded, hesiod, the, prize, the, poet, who, praised, husbandry, he, said, was, greater, than, the, one, who, told, tales, of, battles, and, slaughter, the, study, of, homer, is, one, of, the, oldest, topics, in, scholarship, dating, back, to, antiquity, nonetheless, the, aims, of, homeric, studies, have, changed, over, the, course, of, the, millennia, the, earliest, preserved, comments, on, homer, concern, his, treatment, of, the, gods, which, hostile, critics, such, as, the, poet, xenophanes, of, colophon, denounced, as, immoral, the, allegorist, theagenes, of, rhegium, is, said, to, have, defended, homer, by, arguing, that, the, homeric, poems, are, allegories, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, were, widely, used, as, school, texts, in, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, cultures, they, were, the, first, literary, works, taught, to, all, students, the, iliad, particularly, its, first, few, books, was, far, more, intently, studied, than, the, odyssey, during, the, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, as, a, result, of, the, poems, prominence, in, classical, greek, education, extensive, commentaries, on, them, developed, to, explain, parts, that, were, culturally, or, linguistically, difficult, during, the, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, many, interpreters, especially, the, stoics, who, believed, that, homeric, poems, conveyed, stoic, doctrines, regarded, them, as, allegories, containing, hidden, wisdom, perhaps, partially, because, of, the, homeric, poems, extensive, use, in, education, many, authors, believed, that, homer, s, original, purpose, had, been, to, educate, homer, s, wisdom, became, so, widely, praised, that, he, began, to, acquire, the, image, of, almost, a, prototypical, philosopher, byzantine, scholars, such, as, eustathius, of, thessalonica, and, john, tzetzes, produced, commentaries, extensions, and, scholia, to, homer, especially, in, the, twelfth, century, eustathius, s, commentary, on, the, iliad, alone, is, massive, sprawling, over, nearly, 4, 000, oversized, pages, in, a, 21st, century, printed, version, and, his, commentary, on, the, odyssey, an, additional, nearly, 2, 000, in, 1488, the, greek, scholar, demetrios, chalkokondyles, published, in, florence, the, editio, princeps, of, the, homeric, poems, the, earliest, modern, homeric, scholars, started, with, the, same, basic, approaches, towards, the, homeric, poems, as, scholars, in, antiquity, the, allegorical, interpretation, of, the, homeric, poems, that, had, been, so, prevalent, in, antiquity, returned, to, become, the, prevailing, view, of, the, renaissance, renaissance, humanists, praised, homer, as, the, archetypically, wise, poet, whose, writings, contain, hidden, wisdom, disguised, through, allegory, in, western, europe, during, the, renaissance, virgil, was, more, widely, read, than, homer, and, homer, was, often, seen, through, a, virgilian, lens, in, 1664, contradicting, the, widespread, praise, of, homer, as, the, epitome, of, wisdom, fran, ois, h, delin, abb, d, aubignac, wrote, a, scathing, attack, on, the, homeric, poems, declaring, that, they, were, incoherent, immoral, tasteless, and, without, style, that, homer, never, existed, and, that, the, poems, were, hastily, cobbled, together, by, incompetent, editors, from, unrelated, oral, songs, fifty, years, later, the, english, scholar, richard, bentley, concluded, that, homer, did, exist, but, that, he, was, an, obscure, prehistoric, oral, poet, whose, compositions, bear, little, relation, to, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, as, they, have, been, passed, down, according, to, bentley, homer, wrote, a, sequel, of, songs, and, rhapsodies, to, be, sung, by, himself, for, small, earnings, and, good, cheer, at, festivals, and, other, days, of, merriment, the, ilias, he, wrote, for, men, and, the, odysseis, for, the, other, sex, these, loose, songs, were, not, collected, together, in, the, form, of, an, epic, poem, till, pisistratus, time, about, 500, years, after, friedrich, august, wolf, s, prolegomena, ad, homerum, published, in, 1795, argued, that, much, of, the, material, later, incorporated, into, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, was, originally, composed, in, the, tenth, century, bc, in, the, form, of, short, separate, oral, songs, which, passed, through, oral, tradition, for, roughly, four, hundred, years, before, being, assembled, into, prototypical, versions, of, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, in, the, sixth, century, bc, by, literate, authors, after, being, written, down, wolf, maintained, that, the, two, poems, were, extensively, edited, modernized, and, eventually, shaped, into, their, present, state, as, artistic, unities, wolf, and, the, analyst, school, which, led, the, field, in, the, nineteenth, century, sought, to, recover, the, original, authentic, poems, which, were, thought, to, be, concealed, by, later, excrescences, within, the, analyst, school, were, two, camps, proponents, of, the, lay, theory, which, held, that, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, were, put, together, from, a, large, number, of, short, independent, songs, and, proponents, of, the, nucleus, theory, which, held, that, homer, had, originally, composed, shorter, versions, of, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, which, later, poets, expanded, and, revised, a, small, group, of, scholars, opposed, to, the, analysts, dubbed, unitarians, saw, the, later, additions, as, superior, the, work, of, a, single, inspired, poet, by, around, 1830, the, central, preoccupations, of, homeric, scholars, dealing, with, whether, or, not, homer, actually, existed, when, and, how, the, homeric, poems, originated, how, they, were, transmitted, when, and, how, they, were, finally, written, down, and, their, overall, unity, had, been, dubbed, the, homeric, question, following, world, war, i, the, analyst, school, began, to, fall, out, of, favor, among, homeric, scholars, it, did, not, die, out, entirely, but, it, came, to, be, increasingly, seen, as, a, discredited, dead, end, starting, in, around, 1928, milman, parry, and, albert, lord, after, their, studies, of, folk, bards, in, the, balkans, developed, the, oral, formulaic, theory, that, the, homeric, poems, were, originally, composed, through, improvised, oral, performances, which, relied, on, traditional, epithets, and, poetic, formulas, this, theory, found, very, wide, scholarly, acceptance, and, explained, many, previously, puzzling, features, of, the, homeric, poems, including, their, unusually, archaic, language, their, extensive, use, of, stock, epithets, and, their, other, repetitive, features, many, scholars, concluded, that, the, homeric, question, had, finally, been, answered, meanwhile, the, neoanalysts, sought, to, bridge, the, gap, between, the, analysts, and, unitarians, the, neoanalysts, sought, to, trace, the, relationships, between, the, homeric, poems, and, other, epic, poems, which, have, now, been, lost, but, of, which, modern, scholars, do, possess, some, patchy, knowledge, neoanalysts, hold, that, knowledge, of, earlier, versions, of, the, epics, can, be, derived, from, anomalies, of, structure, and, detail, in, the, surviving, versions, of, the, iliad, and, odyssey, these, anomalies, point, to, earlier, versions, of, the, iliad, in, which, ajax, played, a, more, prominent, role, in, which, the, achaean, embassy, to, achilles, comprised, different, characters, and, in, which, patroclus, was, actually, mistaken, for, achilles, by, the, trojans, they, point, to, earlier, versions, of, the, odyssey, in, which, telemachus, went, in, search, of, news, of, his, father, not, to, menelaus, in, sparta, but, to, idomeneus, in, crete, in, which, telemachus, met, up, with, his, father, in, crete, and, conspired, with, him, to, return, to, ithaca, disguised, as, the, soothsayer, theoclymenus, and, in, which, penelope, recognized, odysseus, much, earlier, in, the, narrative, and, conspired, with, him, in, the, destruction, of, the, suitors, most, contemporary, scholars, although, they, disagree, on, other, questions, about, the, genesis, of, the, poems, agree, that, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, were, not, produced, by, the, same, author, based, on, the, many, differences, of, narrative, manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and, geographical, perspective, and, by, the, apparently, imitative, character, of, certain, passages, of, the, odyssey, in, relation, to, the, iliad, nearly, all, scholars, agree, that, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, are, unified, poems, in, that, each, poem, shows, a, clear, overall, design, and, that, they, are, not, merely, strung, together, from, unrelated, songs, it, is, also, generally, agreed, that, each, poem, was, composed, mostly, by, a, single, author, who, probably, relied, heavily, on, older, oral, traditions, nearly, all, scholars, agree, that, the, doloneia, in, book, x, of, the, iliad, is, not, part, of, the, original, poem, but, rather, a, later, insertion, by, a, different, poet, some, ancient, scholars, believed, homer, to, have, been, an, eyewitness, to, the, trojan, war, others, thought, he, had, lived, up, to, 500, years, afterwards, contemporary, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, date, of, the, poems, a, long, history, of, oral, transmission, lies, behind, the, composition, of, the, poems, complicating, the, search, for, a, precise, date, at, one, extreme, richard, janko, has, proposed, a, date, for, both, poems, to, the, eighth, century, bc, based, on, linguistic, analysis, and, statistics, barry, b, powell, dates, the, composition, of, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, to, sometime, between, 800, and, 750, bc, based, on, the, statement, from, herodotus, who, lived, in, the, late, fifth, century, bc, that, homer, lived, four, hundred, years, before, his, own, time, and, not, more, and, on, the, fact, that, the, poems, do, not, mention, hoplite, battle, tactics, inhumation, or, literacy, martin, litchfield, west, has, argued, that, the, iliad, echoes, the, poetry, of, hesiod, and, that, it, must, have, been, composed, around, 660, 650, bc, at, the, earliest, with, the, odyssey, up, to, a, generation, later, he, also, interprets, passages, in, the, iliad, as, showing, knowledge, of, historical, events, that, occurred, in, the, ancient, near, east, during, the, middle, of, the, seventh, century, bc, including, the, destruction, of, babylon, by, sennacherib, in, 689, bc, and, the, sack, of, thebes, by, ashurbanipal, in, 663, 4, bc, at, the, other, extreme, a, few, american, scholars, such, as, gregory, nagy, see, homer, as, a, continually, evolving, tradition, which, grew, much, more, stable, as, the, tradition, progressed, but, which, did, not, fully, cease, to, continue, changing, and, evolving, until, as, late, as, the, middle, of, the, second, century, bc, homer, is, a, name, of, unknown, etymological, origin, around, which, many, theories, were, erected, in, antiquity, one, such, linkage, was, to, the, greek, h, m, ros, hostage, or, surety, the, explanations, suggested, by, modern, scholars, tend, to, mirror, their, position, on, the, overall, homeric, question, nagy, interprets, it, as, he, who, fits, the, song, together, west, has, advanced, both, possible, greek, and, phoenician, etymologies, scholars, continue, to, debate, questions, such, as, whether, the, trojan, war, actually, took, place, and, if, so, when, and, where, and, to, what, extent, the, society, depicted, by, homer, is, based, on, his, own, or, one, which, was, even, at, the, time, of, the, poems, composition, known, only, as, legends, the, homeric, epics, are, largely, set, in, the, east, and, center, of, the, mediterranean, with, some, scattered, references, to, egypt, ethiopia, and, other, distant, lands, in, a, warlike, society, that, resembles, that, of, the, greek, world, slightly, before, the, hypothesized, date, of, the, poems, composition, in, ancient, greek, chronology, the, sack, of, troy, was, dated, to, 1184, bc, by, the, nineteenth, century, there, was, widespread, scholarly, skepticism, that, the, trojan, war, had, ever, happened, and, that, troy, had, even, existed, but, in, 1873, heinrich, schliemann, announced, to, the, world, that, he, had, discovered, the, ruins, of, homer, s, troy, at, hisarlik, in, modern, turkey, some, contemporary, scholars, think, the, destruction, of, troy, viia, c, 1220, bc, was, the, origin, of, the, myth, of, the, trojan, war, others, that, the, poem, was, inspired, by, multiple, similar, sieges, that, took, place, over, the, centuries, most, scholars, now, agree, that, the, homeric, poems, depict, customs, and, elements, of, the, material, world, that, are, derived, from, different, periods, of, greek, history, for, instance, the, heroes, in, the, poems, use, bronze, weapons, characteristic, of, the, bronze, age, in, which, the, poems, are, set, rather, than, the, later, iron, age, during, which, they, were, composed, yet, the, same, heroes, are, cremated, an, iron, age, practice, rather, than, buried, as, they, were, in, the, bronze, age, in, some, parts, of, the, homeric, poems, heroes, are, described, as, carrying, large, shields, like, those, used, by, warriors, during, the, mycenaean, period, but, in, other, places, they, are, instead, described, carrying, the, smaller, shields, that, were, commonly, used, during, the, time, when, the, poems, were, written, in, the, early, iron, age, in, the, iliad, 10, 260, 265, odysseus, is, described, as, wearing, a, helmet, made, of, boar, s, tusks, such, helmets, were, not, worn, in, homer, s, time, but, were, commonly, worn, by, aristocratic, warriors, between, 1600, and, 1150, bc, the, decipherment, of, linear, b, in, the, 1950s, by, michael, ventris, and, continued, archaeological, investigation, has, increased, modern, scholars, understanding, of, the, bronze, age, aegean, civilisation, which, in, many, ways, resembles, the, ancient, near, east, more, than, the, society, described, by, homer, some, aspects, of, the, homeric, world, are, simply, made, up, for, instance, the, iliad, 22, 145, 56, describes, there, being, two, springs, that, run, near, the, city, of, troy, one, that, runs, steaming, hot, and, the, other, that, runs, icy, cold, it, is, here, that, hector, takes, his, final, stand, against, achilles, archaeologists, however, have, uncovered, no, evidence, that, springs, of, this, description, ever, actually, existed, the, homeric, epics, are, written, in, an, artificial, literary, language, or, kunstsprache, only, used, in, epic, hexameter, poetry, homeric, greek, shows, features, of, multiple, regional, greek, dialects, and, periods, but, is, fundamentally, based, on, ionic, greek, in, keeping, with, the, tradition, that, homer, was, from, ionia, linguistic, analysis, suggests, that, the, iliad, was, composed, slightly, before, the, odyssey, and, that, homeric, formulae, preserve, features, older, than, other, parts, of, the, poems, the, poems, were, composed, in, unrhymed, dactylic, hexameter, ancient, greek, metre, was, quantity, based, rather, than, stress, based, homer, frequently, uses, set, phrases, such, as, epithets, crafty, odysseus, rosy, fingered, dawn, owl, eyed, athena, etc, homeric, formulae, and, then, answered, agamemnon, king, of, men, when, the, early, born, rose, fingered, dawn, came, to, light, thus, he, she, spoke, simile, type, scenes, ring, composition, and, repetition, these, habits, aid, the, extemporizing, bard, and, are, characteristic, of, oral, poetry, for, instance, the, main, words, of, a, homeric, sentence, are, generally, placed, towards, the, beginning, whereas, literate, poets, like, virgil, or, milton, use, longer, and, more, complicated, syntactical, structures, homer, then, expands, on, these, ideas, in, subsequent, clauses, this, technique, is, called, parataxis, the, so, called, type, scenes, typische, szenen, were, named, by, walter, arend, in, 1933, he, noted, that, homer, often, when, describing, frequently, recurring, activities, such, as, eating, praying, fighting, and, dressing, used, blocks, of, set, phrases, in, sequence, that, were, then, elaborated, by, the, poet, the, analyst, school, had, considered, these, repetitions, as, un, homeric, whereas, arend, interpreted, them, philosophically, parry, and, lord, noted, that, these, conventions, are, found, in, many, other, cultures, ring, composition, or, chiastic, structure, when, a, phrase, or, idea, is, repeated, at, both, the, beginning, and, end, of, a, story, or, a, series, of, such, ideas, first, appears, in, the, order, a, b, c, before, being, reversed, as, c, b, a, has, been, observed, in, the, homeric, epics, opinion, differs, as, to, whether, these, occurrences, are, a, conscious, artistic, device, a, mnemonic, aid, or, a, spontaneous, feature, of, human, storytelling, both, of, the, homeric, poems, begin, with, an, invocation, to, the, muse, in, the, iliad, the, poet, beseeches, her, to, sing, of, the, anger, of, achilles, and, in, the, odyssey, he, asks, her, to, tell, of, the, man, of, many, ways, a, similar, opening, was, later, employed, by, virgil, in, his, aeneid, the, orally, transmitted, homeric, poems, were, put, into, written, form, at, some, point, between, the, eighth, and, sixth, centuries, bce, some, scholars, believe, that, they, were, dictated, to, a, scribe, by, the, poet, and, that, our, inherited, versions, of, the, iliad, and, odyssey, were, in, origin, orally, dictated, texts, albert, lord, noted, that, the, balkan, bards, that, he, was, studying, revised, and, expanded, their, songs, in, their, process, of, dictating, some, scholars, hypothesize, that, a, similar, process, of, revision, and, expansion, occurred, when, the, homeric, poems, were, first, written, down, other, scholars, hold, that, after, the, poems, were, created, in, the, eighth, century, they, continued, to, be, orally, transmitted, with, considerable, revision, until, they, were, written, down, in, the, sixth, century, after, textualisation, the, poems, were, each, divided, into, 24, rhapsodes, today, referred, to, as, books, and, labelled, by, the, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, most, scholars, attribute, the, book, divisions, to, the, hellenistic, scholars, of, alexandria, in, egypt, some, trace, the, divisions, back, further, to, the, classical, period, very, few, credit, homer, himself, with, the, divisions, in, antiquity, it, was, widely, held, that, the, homeric, poems, were, collected, and, organised, in, athens, in, the, late, sixth, century, bce, by, pisistratus, died, 528, 7, bce, in, what, subsequent, scholars, have, dubbed, the, peisistratean, recension, the, idea, that, the, homeric, poems, were, originally, transmitted, orally, and, first, written, down, during, the, reign, of, pisistratus, is, referenced, by, the, first, century, bce, roman, orator, cicero, and, is, also, referenced, in, a, number, of, other, surviving, sources, including, two, ancient, lives, of, homer, from, around, 150, bce, the, texts, of, the, homeric, poems, found, in, papyrus, fragments, exhibit, much, less, variation, and, the, text, seems, to, have, become, relatively, stable, after, the, establishment, of, the, library, of, alexandria, homeric, scholars, such, as, zenodotus, of, ephesus, aristophanes, of, byzantium, and, in, particular, aristarchus, of, samothrace, helped, establish, a, canonical, text, the, first, printed, edition, of, homer, was, produced, in, 1488, in, milan, italy, by, demetrios, chalkokondyles, today, scholars, use, medieval, manuscripts, papyri, and, other, sources, some, argue, for, a, multi, text, view, rather, than, seeking, a, single, definitive, text, the, nineteenth, century, edition, of, arthur, ludwich, mainly, follows, aristarchus, s, work, whereas, van, thiel, s, 1991, 1996, follows, the, medieval, vulgate, others, such, as, martin, west, 1998, 2000, or, t, w, allen, fall, somewhere, between, these, two, extremes, him, with, that, falchion, in, his, hand, behold, who, comes, before, the, three, even, as, their, lord, that, one, is, homer, poet, sovereign, this, is, a, partial, list, of, translations, into, english, of, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey
