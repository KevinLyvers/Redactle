he, would, later, call, the, frieze, of, life, depicting, a, series, of, deeply, felt, themes, such, as, love, anxiety, jealousy, and, betrayal, steeped, in, atmosphere, the, scream, was, conceived, in, kristiania, according, to, munch, he, was, out, walking, at, sunset, when, he, heard, the, enormous, infinite, scream, of, nature, the, painting, s, agonized, face, is, widely, identified, with, the, angst, of, the, modern, person, between, 1893, and, 1910, he, made, two, painted, versions, and, two, in, pastels, as, well, as, a, number, of, prints, one, of, the, pastels, would, eventually, command, the, fourth, highest, nominal, price, paid, for, a, painting, at, auction, as, his, fame, and, wealth, grew, his, emotional, state, remained, insecure, he, briefly, considered, marriage, but, could, not, commit, himself, a, mental, breakdown, in, 1908, forced, him, to, give, up, heavy, drinking, and, he, was, cheered, by, his, increasing, acceptance, by, the, people, of, kristiania, and, exposure, in, the, city, s, museums, his, later, years, were, spent, working, in, peace, and, privacy, although, his, works, were, banned, in, nazi, occupied, europe, most, of, them, survived, world, war, ii, securing, him, a, legacy, edvard, munch, was, born, in, a, farmhouse, in, the, village, of, dalsbruk, in, l, ten, norway, to, laura, catherine, bj, lstad, and, christian, munch, the, son, of,

his, school, mates, and, his, aunt, christian, munch, also, instructed, his, son, in, history, and, literature, and, entertained, the, children, with, vivid, ghost, stories, and, the, tales, of, the, american, writer, edgar, allan, poe, as, edvard, remembered, it, christian, s, positive, behavior, towards, his, children, was, overshadowed, by, his, morbid, pietism, munch, wrote, my, father, was, temperamentally, nervous, and, obsessively, religious, to, the, point, of, psychoneurosis, from, him, i, inherited, the, seeds, of, madness, the, angels, of, fear, sorrow, and, death, stood, by, my, side, since, the, day, i, was, born, christian, reprimanded, his, children, by, telling, them, that, their, mother, was, looking, down, from, heaven, and, grieving, over, their, misbehavior, the, oppressive, religious, milieu, edvard, s, poor, health, and, the, vivid, ghost, stories, helped, inspire, his, macabre, visions, and, nightmares, he, felt, that, death, was, constantly, approaching, one, of, munch, s, younger, sisters, laura, was, diagnosed, with, mental, illness, at, an, early, age, of, the, five, siblings, only, andreas, married, but, he, died, a, few, months, after, the, wedding, munch, would, later, write, i, inherited, two, of, mankind, s, most, frightful, enemies, the, heritage, of, consumption, and, insanity, christian, munch, s, military, pay, was, very, low, and, his, attempts, to, develop, a, private, side, practice, failed, keeping, his, family, in, genteel, but, perennial, poverty, they, moved, frequently, from, one, cheap, flat, to, another, munch, s, early, drawings, and, watercolors, depicted, these, interiors, and, the, individual, objects, such, as, medicine, bottles, and, drawing, implements, plus, some, landscapes, by, his, teens, art, dominated, munch, s, interests, at, 13, munch, had, his, first, exposure, to, other, artists, at, the, newly, formed, art, association, where, he, admired, the, work, of, the, norwegian, landscape, school, he, returned, to, copy, the, paintings, and, soon, he, began, to, paint, in, oils, due, in, part, to, the, mental, health, struggles, and, incarceration, in, an, institution, of, his, sister, laura, catherine, and, in, part, to, then, prevailing, beliefs, in, hereditary, insanity, edvard, munch, often, expressed, his, fear, that, he, would, become, insane, critics, of, his, art, also, accused, him, of, insanity, deploying, this, term, in, a, purely, abusive, sense, when, his, painting, the, sick, child, was, first, displayed, in, oslo, in, 1886, gustav, wentzel, and, other, young, realists, encircled, munch, and, accused, him, of, being, a, madman, another, critic, johan, scharffenberg, stated, that, because, munch, derived, from, an, insane, family, his, art, was, also, insane, he, is, claimed, by, some, to, have, had, borderline, personality, disorder, a, mental, health, disorder, characterized, by, fear, of, abandonment, chronic, feelings, of, emptiness, impulsive, behavior, and, various, other, symptoms, munch, also, displayed, alcoholism, a, trait, often, associated, with, impulsivity, in, bpd, in, 1879, munch, enrolled, in, a, technical, college, to, study, engineering, where, he, excelled, in, physics, chemistry, and, mathematics, he, learned, scaled, and, perspective, drawing, but, frequent, illnesses, interrupted, his, studies, the, following, year, much, to, his, father, s, disappointment, munch, left, the, college, determined, to, become, a, painter, his, father, viewed, art, as, an, unholy, trade, and, his, neighbors, reacted, bitterly, and, sent, him, anonymous, letters, in, contrast, to, his, father, s, rabid, pietism, munch, adopted, an, undogmatic, stance, towards, art, he, wrote, his, goal, in, his, diary, in, my, art, i, attempt, to, explain, life, and, its, meaning, to, myself, in, 1881, munch, enrolled, at, the, royal, school, of, art, and, design, of, kristiania, one, of, whose, founders, was, his, distant, relative, jacob, munch, his, teachers, were, the, sculptor, julius, middelthun, and, the, naturalistic, painter, christian, krohg, that, year, munch, demonstrated, his, quick, absorption, of, his, figure, training, at, the, academy, in, his, first, portraits, including, one, of, his, father, and, his, first, self, portrait, in, 1883, munch, took, part, in, his, first, public, exhibition, and, shared, a, studio, with, other, students, his, full, length, portrait, of, karl, jensen, hjell, a, notorious, bohemian, about, town, earned, a, critic, s, dismissive, response, it, is, impressionism, carried, to, the, extreme, it, is, a, travesty, of, art, munch, s, nude, paintings, from, this, period, survive, only, in, sketches, except, for, standing, nude, 1887, they, may, have, been, confiscated, by, his, father, impressionism, inspired, munch, from, a, young, age, during, these, early, years, he, experimented, with, many, styles, including, naturalism, and, impressionism, some, early, works, are, reminiscent, of, manet, many, of, these, attempts, brought, him, unfavorable, criticism, from, the, press, and, garnered, him, constant, rebukes, by, his, father, who, nonetheless, provided, him, with, small, sums, for, living, expenses, at, one, point, however, munch, s, father, perhaps, swayed, by, the, negative, opinion, of, munch, s, cousin, edvard, diriks, an, established, traditional, painter, destroyed, at, least, one, painting, likely, a, nude, and, refused, to, advance, any, more, money, for, art, supplies, munch, also, received, his, father, s, ire, for, his, relationship, with, hans, j, ger, the, local, nihilist, who, lived, by, the, code, a, passion, to, destroy, is, also, a, creative, passion, and, who, advocated, suicide, as, the, ultimate, way, to, freedom, munch, came, under, his, malevolent, anti, establishment, spell, my, ideas, developed, under, the, influence, of, the, bohemians, or, rather, under, hans, j, ger, many, people, have, mistakenly, claimed, that, my, ideas, were, formed, under, the, influence, of, strindberg, and, the, germans, but, that, is, wrong, they, had, already, been, formed, by, then, at, that, time, contrary, to, many, of, the, other, bohemians, munch, was, still, respectful, of, women, as, well, as, reserved, and, well, mannered, but, he, began, to, give, in, to, the, binge, drinking, and, brawling, of, his, circle, he, was, unsettled, by, the, sexual, revolution, going, on, at, the, time, and, by, the, independent, women, around, him, he, later, turned, cynical, concerning, sexual, matters, expressed, not, only, in, his, behavior, and, his, art, but, in, his, writings, as, well, an, example, being, a, long, poem, called, the, city, of, free, love, after, numerous, experiments, munch, concluded, that, the, impressionist, idiom, did, not, allow, sufficient, expression, he, found, it, superficial, and, too, akin, to, scientific, experimentation, he, felt, a, need, to, go, deeper, and, explore, situations, brimming, with, emotional, content, and, expressive, energy, under, j, ger, s, commandment, that, munch, should, write, his, life, meaning, that, munch, should, explore, his, own, emotional, and, psychological, state, the, young, artist, began, a, period, of, reflection, and, self, examination, recording, his, thoughts, in, his, soul, s, diary, this, deeper, perspective, helped, move, him, to, a, new, view, of, his, art, he, wrote, that, his, painting, the, sick, child, 1886, based, on, his, sister, s, death, was, his, first, soul, painting, his, first, break, from, impressionism, the, painting, received, a, negative, response, from, critics, and, from, his, family, and, caused, another, violent, outburst, of, moral, indignation, from, the, community, only, his, friend, christian, krohg, defended, him, he, paints, or, rather, regards, things, in, a, way, that, is, different, from, that, of, other, artists, he, sees, only, the, essential, and, that, naturally, is, all, he, paints, for, this, reason, munch, s, pictures, are, as, a, rule, not, complete, as, people, are, so, delighted, to, discover, for, themselves, oh, yes, they, are, complete, his, complete, handiwork, art, is, complete, once, the, artist, has, really, said, everything, that, was, on, his, mind, and, this, is, precisely, the, advantage, munch, has, over, painters, of, the, other, generation, that, he, really, knows, how, to, show, us, what, he, has, felt, and, what, has, gripped, him, and, to, this, he, subordinates, everything, else, munch, continued, to, employ, a, variety, of, brushstroke, techniques, and, color, palettes, throughout, the, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, as, he, struggled, to, define, his, style, his, idiom, continued, to, veer, between, naturalistic, as, seen, in, portrait, of, hans, j, ger, and, impressionistic, as, in, rue, lafayette, his, inger, on, the, beach, 1889, which, caused, another, storm, of, confusion, and, controversy, hints, at, the, simplified, forms, heavy, outlines, sharp, contrasts, and, emotional, content, of, his, mature, style, to, come, he, began, to, carefully, calculate, his, compositions, to, create, tension, and, emotion, while, stylistically, influenced, by, the, post, impressionists, what, evolved, was, a, subject, matter, which, was, symbolist, in, content, depicting, a, state, of, mind, rather, than, an, external, reality, in, 1889, munch, presented, his, first, one, man, show, of, nearly, all, his, works, to, date, the, recognition, it, received, led, to, a, two, year, state, scholarship, to, study, in, paris, under, french, painter, l, on, bonnat, munch, seems, to, have, been, an, early, critic, of, photography, as, an, art, form, and, remarked, that, it, will, never, compete, with, the, brush, and, the, palette, until, such, time, as, photographs, can, be, taken, in, heaven, or, hell, munch, s, younger, sister, laura, was, the, subject, of, his, 1899, interior, melancholy, laura, amanda, o, neill, says, of, the, work, in, this, heated, claustrophobic, scene, munch, not, only, portrays, laura, s, tragedy, but, his, own, dread, of, the, madness, he, might, have, inherited, munch, arrived, in, paris, during, the, festivities, of, the, exposition, universelle, 1889, and, roomed, with, two, fellow, norwegian, artists, his, picture, morning, 1884, was, displayed, at, the, norwegian, pavilion, he, spent, his, mornings, at, bonnat, s, busy, studio, which, included, female, models, and, afternoons, at, the, exhibition, galleries, and, museums, where, students, were, expected, to, make, copies, as, a, way, of, learning, technique, and, observation, munch, recorded, little, enthusiasm, for, bonnat, s, drawing, lessons, it, tires, and, bores, me, it, s, numbing, but, enjoyed, the, master, s, commentary, during, museum, trips, munch, was, enthralled, by, the, vast, display, of, modern, european, art, including, the, works, of, three, artists, who, would, prove, influential, paul, gauguin, vincent, van, gogh, and, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, all, notable, for, how, they, used, color, to, convey, emotion, munch, was, particularly, inspired, by, gauguin, s, reaction, against, realism, and, his, credo, that, art, was, human, work, and, not, an, imitation, of, nature, a, belief, earlier, stated, by, whistler, as, one, of, his, berlin, friends, said, later, of, munch, he, need, not, make, his, way, to, tahiti, to, see, and, experience, the, primitive, in, human, nature, he, carries, his, own, tahiti, within, him, influenced, by, gauguin, as, well, as, the, etchings, of, german, artist, max, klinger, munch, experimented, with, prints, as, a, medium, to, create, graphic, versions, of, his, works, in, 1896, he, created, his, first, woodcuts, a, medium, that, proved, ideal, to, munch, s, symbolic, imagery, together, with, his, contemporary, nikolai, astrup, munch, is, considered, an, innovator, of, the, woodcut, medium, in, norway, in, december, 1889, his, father, died, leaving, munch, s, family, destitute, he, returned, home, and, arranged, a, large, loan, from, a, wealthy, norwegian, collector, when, wealthy, relatives, failed, to, help, and, assumed, financial, responsibility, for, his, family, from, then, on, christian, s, death, depressed, him, and, he, was, plagued, by, suicidal, thoughts, i, live, with, the, dead, my, mother, my, sister, my, grandfather, my, father, kill, yourself, and, then, it, s, over, why, live, munch, s, paintings, of, the, following, year, included, sketchy, tavern, scenes, and, a, series, of, bright, cityscapes, in, which, he, experimented, with, the, pointillist, style, of, georges, seurat, by, 1892, munch, formulated, his, characteristic, and, original, synthetist, style, as, seen, in, melancholy, 1891, in, which, color, is, the, symbol, laden, element, considered, by, the, artist, and, journalist, christian, krohg, as, the, first, symbolist, painting, by, a, norwegian, artist, melancholy, was, exhibited, in, 1891, at, the, autumn, exhibition, in, oslo, in, 1892, adelsteen, normann, on, behalf, of, the, union, of, berlin, artists, invited, munch, to, exhibit, at, its, november, exhibition, the, society, s, first, one, man, exhibition, however, his, paintings, evoked, bitter, controversy, dubbed, the, munch, affair, and, after, one, week, the, exhibition, closed, munch, was, pleased, with, the, great, commotion, and, wrote, in, a, letter, never, have, i, had, such, an, amusing, time, it, s, incredible, that, something, as, innocent, as, painting, should, have, created, such, a, stir, in, berlin, munch, became, involved, in, an, international, circle, of, writers, artists, and, critics, including, the, swedish, dramatist, and, leading, intellectual, august, strindberg, whom, he, painted, in, 1892, he, also, met, danish, writer, and, painter, holger, drachmann, whom, he, painted, in, 1898, drachmann, was, 17, years, munch, s, senior, and, a, drinking, companion, at, zum, schwarzen, ferkel, at, the, black, piglet, in, 1893, 94, in, 1894, drachmann, wrote, of, munch, he, struggles, hard, good, luck, with, your, struggles, lonely, norwegian, during, his, four, years, in, berlin, munch, sketched, out, most, of, the, ideas, that, would, be, comprised, in, his, major, work, the, frieze, of, life, first, designed, for, book, illustration, but, later, expressed, in, paintings, he, sold, little, but, made, some, income, from, charging, entrance, fees, to, view, his, controversial, paintings, munch, began, allowing, the, appearance, of, drips, in, his, paintings, as, first, subtly, seen, in, the, painted, version, of, at, the, deathbed, 1895, this, effect, resulted, from, the, use, of, highly, diluted, paint, and, the, deliberate, inclusion, of, drips, initially, this, effect, was, visible, at, the, edges, of, his, work, but, later, the, drips, became, more, central, as, seen, in, by, the, deathbed, 1915, the, effect, of, running, paint, was, later, adopted, by, many, artists, his, other, paintings, including, casino, scenes, show, a, simplification, of, form, and, detail, which, marked, his, early, mature, style, munch, also, began, to, favor, a, shallow, pictorial, space, and, a, minimal, backdrop, for, his, frontal, figures, since, poses, were, chosen, to, produce, the, most, convincing, images, of, states, of, mind, and, psychological, conditions, as, in, ashes, the, figures, impart, a, monumental, static, quality, munch, s, figures, appear, to, play, roles, on, a, theatre, stage, death, in, the, sick, room, whose, pantomime, of, fixed, postures, signify, various, emotions, since, each, character, embodies, a, single, psychological, dimension, as, in, the, scream, munch, s, men, and, women, began, to, appear, more, symbolic, than, realistic, he, wrote, no, longer, should, interiors, be, painted, people, reading, and, women, knitting, there, would, be, living, people, breathing, and, feeling, suffering, and, loving, the, scream, exists, in, four, versions, two, pastels, 1893, and, 1895, and, two, paintings, 1893, and, 1910, there, are, also, several, lithographs, of, the, scream, 1895, and, later, the, 1895, pastel, sold, at, auction, on, 2, may, 2012, for, us, 119, 922, 500, including, commission, it, is, the, most, colorful, of, the, versions, and, is, distinctive, for, the, downward, looking, stance, of, one, of, its, background, figures, it, is, also, the, only, version, not, held, by, a, norwegian, museum, the, 1893, version, was, stolen, from, the, national, gallery, in, oslo, in, 1994, and, was, recovered, the, 1910, painting, was, stolen, in, 2004, from, the, munch, museum, in, oslo, but, recovered, in, 2006, with, limited, damage, the, scream, is, munch, s, most, famous, work, and, one, of, the, most, recognizable, paintings, in, all, art, it, has, been, widely, interpreted, as, representing, the, universal, anxiety, of, modern, man, painted, with, broad, bands, of, garish, color, and, highly, simplified, forms, and, employing, a, high, viewpoint, it, reduces, the, agonized, figure, to, a, garbed, skull, in, the, throes, of, an, emotional, crisis, with, this, painting, munch, met, his, stated, goal, of, the, study, of, the, soul, that, is, to, say, the, study, of, my, own, self, munch, wrote, of, how, the, painting, came, to, be, i, was, walking, down, the, road, with, two, friends, when, the, sun, set, suddenly, the, sky, turned, as, red, as, blood, i, stopped, and, leaned, against, the, fence, feeling, unspeakably, tired, tongues, of, fire, and, blood, stretched, over, the, bluish, black, fjord, my, friends, went, on, walking, while, i, lagged, behind, shivering, with, fear, then, i, heard, the, enormous, infinite, scream, of, nature, he, later, described, the, personal, anguish, behind, the, painting, for, several, years, i, was, almost, mad, you, know, my, picture, the, scream, i, was, stretched, to, the, limit, nature, was, screaming, in, my, blood, after, that, i, gave, up, hope, ever, of, being, able, to, love, again, in, 2003, comparing, the, painting, with, other, great, works, art, historian, martha, tedeschi, wrote, whistler, s, mother, wood, s, american, gothic, leonardo, da, vinci, s, mona, lisa, and, edvard, munch, s, the, scream, have, all, achieved, something, that, most, paintings, regardless, of, their, art, historical, importance, beauty, or, monetary, value, have, not, they, communicate, a, specific, meaning, almost, immediately, to, almost, every, viewer, these, few, works, have, successfully, made, the, transition, from, the, elite, realm, of, the, museum, visitor, to, the, enormous, venue, of, popular, culture, in, december, 1893, unter, den, linden, in, berlin, was, the, location, of, an, exhibition, of, munch, s, work, showing, among, other, pieces, six, paintings, entitled, study, for, a, series, love, this, began, a, cycle, he, later, called, the, frieze, of, life, a, poem, about, life, love, and, death, frieze, of, life, motifs, such, as, the, storm, and, moonlight, are, steeped, in, atmosphere, other, motifs, illuminate, the, nocturnal, side, of, love, such, as, rose, and, amelie, and, love, and, pain, in, death, in, the, sickroom, the, subject, is, the, death, of, his, sister, sophie, which, he, re, worked, in, many, future, variations, the, dramatic, focus, of, the, painting, portraying, his, entire, family, is, dispersed, in, the, separate, and, disconnected, figures, of, sorrow, in, 1894, he, enlarged, the, spectrum, of, motifs, by, adding, anxiety, ashes, madonna, and, women, in, three, stages, from, innocence, to, old, age, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, munch, worked, to, finish, the, frieze, he, painted, a, number, of, pictures, several, of, them, in, bigger, format, and, to, some, extent, featuring, the, art, nouveau, aesthetics, of, the, time, he, made, a, wooden, frame, with, carved, reliefs, for, the, large, painting, metabolism, 1898, initially, called, adam, and, eve, this, work, reveals, munch, s, pre, occupation, with, the, fall, of, man, and, his, pessimistic, philosophy, of, love, motifs, such, as, the, empty, cross, and, golgotha, both, c, 1900, reflect, a, metaphysical, orientation, and, also, reflect, munch, s, pietistic, upbringing, the, entire, frieze, was, shown, for, the, first, time, at, the, secessionist, exhibition, in, berlin, in, 1902, the, frieze, of, life, themes, recur, throughout, munch, s, work, but, he, especially, focused, on, them, in, the, mid, 1890s, in, sketches, paintings, pastels, and, prints, he, tapped, the, depths, of, his, feelings, to, examine, his, major, motifs, the, stages, of, life, the, femme, fatale, the, hopelessness, of, love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual, humiliation, and, separation, in, life, and, death, these, themes, are, expressed, in, paintings, such, as, the, sick, child, 1885, love, and, pain, retitled, vampire, 1893, 94, ashes, 1894, and, the, bridge, the, latter, shows, limp, figures, with, featureless, or, hidden, faces, over, which, loom, the, threatening, shapes, of, heavy, trees, and, brooding, houses, munch, portrayed, women, either, as, frail, innocent, sufferers, see, puberty, and, love, and, pain, or, as, the, cause, of, great, longing, jealousy, and, despair, see, separation, jealousy, and, ashes, munch, often, uses, shadows, and, rings, of, color, around, his, figures, to, emphasize, an, aura, of, fear, menace, anxiety, or, sexual, intensity, these, paintings, have, been, interpreted, as, reflections, of, the, artist, s, sexual, anxieties, though, it, could, also, be, argued, that, they, represent, his, turbulent, relationship, with, love, itself, and, his, general, pessimism, regarding, human, existence, many, of, these, sketches, and, paintings, were, done, in, several, versions, such, as, madonna, hands, and, puberty, and, also, transcribed, as, wood, block, prints, and, lithographs, munch, hated, to, part, with, his, paintings, because, he, thought, of, his, work, as, a, single, body, of, expression, so, to, capitalize, on, his, production, and, make, some, income, he, turned, to, graphic, arts, to, reproduce, many, of, his, paintings, including, those, in, this, series, munch, admitted, to, the, personal, goals, of, his, work, but, he, also, offered, his, art, to, a, wider, purpose, my, art, is, really, a, voluntary, confession, and, an, attempt, to, explain, to, myself, my, relationship, with, life, it, is, therefore, actually, a, sort, of, egoism, but, i, am, constantly, hoping, that, through, this, i, can, help, others, achieve, clarity, while, attracting, strongly, negative, reactions, in, the, 1890s, munch, began, to, receive, some, understanding, of, his, artistic, goals, as, one, critic, wrote, with, ruthless, contempt, for, form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and, realism, he, paints, with, intuitive, strength, of, talent, the, most, subtle, visions, of, the, soul, one, of, his, great, supporters, in, berlin, was, walther, rathenau, later, the, german, foreign, minister, who, strongly, contributed, to, his, success, despite, over, half, of, his, painted, works, being, landscapes, munch, is, rarely, seen, as, a, landscape, artist, however, munch, had, a, fixation, on, several, elements, of, nature, that, resulted, in, recurrent, motifs, throughout, his, work, the, shoreline, and, the, forest, are, both, significant, settings, of, munch, s, work, a, focus, on, munch, s, use, of, nature, to, convey, emotion, is, the, topic, of, edvard, munch, trembling, earth, at, the, clark, art, institute, in, 1896, munch, moved, to, paris, where, he, focused, on, graphic, representations, of, his, frieze, of, life, themes, he, further, developed, his, woodcut, and, lithographic, technique, munch, s, self, portrait, with, skeleton, arm, 1895, is, done, with, an, etching, needle, and, ink, method, also, used, by, paul, klee, munch, also, produced, multi, colored, versions, of, the, sick, child, concerning, tuberculosis, which, sold, well, as, well, as, several, nudes, and, multiple, versions, of, kiss, 1892, in, may, 1896, siegfried, bing, held, an, exhibition, of, munch, s, work, inside, bing, s, maison, de, l, art, nouveau, the, exhibition, displayed, 60, works, including, the, kiss, the, scream, madonna, the, sick, child, the, death, chamber, and, the, day, after, bing, s, exhibition, helped, to, introduce, munch, to, a, french, audience, still, many, of, the, parisian, critics, still, considered, munch, s, work, violent, and, brutal, even, if, his, exhibitions, received, serious, attention, and, good, attendance, his, financial, situation, improved, considerably, and, in, 1897, munch, bought, himself, a, summer, house, facing, the, fjords, of, kristiania, a, small, fisherman, s, cabin, built, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, small, town, of, sg, rdstrand, in, norway, he, dubbed, this, home, the, happy, house, and, returned, here, almost, every, summer, for, the, next, 20, years, it, was, this, place, he, missed, when, he, was, abroad, and, when, he, felt, depressed, and, exhausted, to, walk, in, sg, rdstrand, is, like, walking, among, my, paintings, i, get, so, inspired, to, paint, when, i, am, here, in, 1897, munch, returned, to, kristiania, where, he, also, received, grudging, acceptance, one, critic, wrote, a, fair, number, of, these, pictures, have, been, exhibited, before, in, my, opinion, these, improve, on, acquaintance, in, 1899, munch, began, an, intimate, relationship, with, tulla, larsen, a, liberated, upper, class, woman, they, traveled, to, italy, together, and, upon, returning, munch, began, another, fertile, period, in, his, art, which, included, landscapes, and, his, final, painting, in, the, frieze, of, life, series, the, dance, of, life, 1899, larsen, was, eager, for, marriage, but, munch, was, not, his, drinking, and, poor, health, reinforced, his, fears, as, he, wrote, in, the, third, person, ever, since, he, was, a, child, he, had, hated, marriage, his, sick, and, nervous, home, had, given, him, the, feeling, that, he, had, no, right, to, get, married, munch, almost, gave, in, to, tulla, but, fled, from, her, in, 1900, also, turning, away, from, her, considerable, fortune, and, moved, to, berlin, his, girls, on, the, jetty, created, in, 18, different, versions, demonstrated, the, theme, of, feminine, youth, without, negative, connotations, in, 1902, he, displayed, his, works, thematically, at, the, hall, of, the, berlin, secession, producing, a, symphonic, effect, it, made, a, great, stir, a, lot, of, antagonism, and, a, lot, of, approval, the, berlin, critics, were, beginning, to, appreciate, munch, s, work, even, though, the, public, still, found, his, work, alien, and, strange, the, good, press, coverage, gained, munch, the, attention, of, influential, patrons, albert, kollman, and, max, linde, he, described, the, turn, of, events, in, his, diary, after, 20, years, of, struggle, and, misery, forces, of, good, finally, come, to, my, aid, in, germany, and, a, bright, door, opens, up, for, me, however, despite, this, positive, change, munch, s, self, destructive, and, erratic, behavior, led, him, first, to, a, violent, quarrel, with, another, artist, then, to, an, accidental, shooting, in, the, presence, of, tulla, larsen, who, had, returned, for, a, brief, reconciliation, which, injured, two, of, his, fingers, munch, later, sawed, a, self, portrait, depicting, him, and, larsen, in, half, as, a, consequence, of, the, shooting, and, subsequent, events, she, finally, left, him, and, married, a, younger, colleague, of, munch, munch, took, this, as, a, betrayal, and, he, dwelled, on, the, humiliation, for, some, time, to, come, channeling, some, of, the, bitterness, into, new, paintings, his, paintings, still, life, the, murderess, and, the, death, of, marat, i, done, in, 1906, 07, clearly, reference, the, shooting, incident, and, the, emotional, after, effects, in, 1903, 04, munch, exhibited, in, paris, where, the, coming, fauvists, famous, for, their, boldly, false, colors, likely, saw, his, works, and, might, have, found, inspiration, in, them, when, the, fauves, held, their, own, exhibit, in, 1906, munch, was, invited, and, displayed, his, works, with, theirs, after, studying, the, sculpture, of, rodin, munch, may, have, experimented, with, plasticine, as, an, aid, to, design, but, he, produced, little, sculpture, during, this, time, munch, received, many, commissions, for, portraits, and, prints, which, improved, his, usually, precarious, financial, condition, in, 1906, he, painted, the, screen, for, an, ibsen, play, in, the, small, kammerspiele, theatre, located, in, berlin, s, deutsches, theater, in, which, the, frieze, of, life, was, hung, the, theatre, s, director, max, reinhardt, later, sold, it, it, is, now, in, the, berlin, nationalgalerie, after, an, earlier, period, of, landscapes, in, 1907, he, turned, his, attention, again, to, human, figures, and, situations, in, the, autumn, of, 1908, munch, s, anxiety, compounded, by, excessive, drinking, and, brawling, had, become, acute, as, he, later, wrote, my, condition, was, verging, on, madness, it, was, touch, and, go, subject, to, hallucinations, and, feelings, of, persecution, he, entered, the, clinic, of, daniel, jacobson, the, therapy, munch, received, for, the, next, eight, months, included, diet, and, electrification, a, treatment, then, fashionable, for, nervous, conditions, not, to, be, confused, with, electroconvulsive, therapy, munch, s, stay, in, hospital, stabilized, his, personality, and, after, returning, to, norway, in, 1909, his, work, became, more, colorful, and, less, pessimistic, further, brightening, his, mood, the, general, public, of, kristiania, finally, warmed, to, his, work, and, museums, began, to, purchase, his, paintings, he, was, made, a, knight, of, the, royal, order, of, st, olav, for, services, in, art, his, first, american, exhibit, was, in, 1912, in, new, york, as, part, of, his, recovery, jacobson, advised, munch, to, only, socialize, with, good, friends, and, avoid, drinking, in, public, munch, followed, this, advice, and, in, the, process, produced, several, full, length, portraits, of, high, quality, of, friends, and, patrons, honest, portrayals, devoid, of, flattery, he, also, created, landscapes, and, scenes, of, people, at, work, and, play, using, a, new, optimistic, style, broad, loose, brushstrokes, of, vibrant, color, with, frequent, use, of, white, space, and, rare, use, of, black, with, only, occasional, references, to, his, morbid, themes, with, more, income, munch, was, able, to, buy, several, properties, giving, him, new, vistas, for, his, art, and, he, was, finally, able, to, provide, for, his, family, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, found, munch, with, divided, loyalties, as, he, stated, all, my, friends, are, german, but, it, is, france, i, love, in, the, 1930s, his, german, patrons, many, jewish, lost, their, fortunes, and, some, their, lives, during, the, rise, of, the, nazi, movement, munch, found, norwegian, printers, to, substitute, for, the, germans, who, had, been, printing, his, graphic, work, given, his, poor, health, history, during, 1918, munch, felt, himself, lucky, to, have, survived, a, bout, of, the, spanish, flu, the, worldwide, pandemic, of, that, year, munch, spent, most, of, his, last, two, decades, in, solitude, at, his, nearly, self, sufficient, estate, in, ekely, at, sk, yen, oslo, many, of, his, late, paintings, celebrate, farm, life, including, several, in, which, he, used, his, work, horse, rousseau, as, a, model, without, any, effort, munch, attracted, a, steady, stream, of, female, models, whom, he, painted, as, the, subjects, of, numerous, nude, paintings, he, likely, had, sexual, relationships, with, some, of, them, munch, occasionally, left, his, home, to, paint, murals, on, commission, including, those, done, for, the, freia, chocolate, factory, to, the, end, of, his, life, munch, continued, to, paint, unsparing, self, portraits, adding, to, his, self, searching, cycle, of, his, life, and, his, unflinching, series, of, takes, on, his, emotional, and, physical, states, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, nazis, labeled, munch, s, work, degenerate, art, along, with, that, of, picasso, klee, matisse, gauguin, and, many, other, modern, artists, and, removed, his, 82, works, from, german,
