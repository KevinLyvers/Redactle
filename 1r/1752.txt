the, suit, which, lasted, over, a, decade, and, cost, the, company, 5, million, eastman, paid, close, attention, to, kodak, s, advertisements, he, coined, the, slogan, you, press, the, button, we, do, the, rest, which, became, ubiquitous, in, the, general, public, as, kodak, pursued, a, monopoly, on, film, through, patents, and, acquisitions, the, company, experienced, rapid, growth, by, 1896,

actions, attracted, the, attention, of, the, federal, government, which, began, an, anti, trust, investigation, into, kodak, in, 1911, for, exclusive, contracts, acquisitions, of, competitors, and, price, fixing, this, resulted, in, a, lawsuit, against, kodak, in, 1913, and, a, final, judgement, in, 1921, ordering, kodak, to, stop, fixing, prices, and, sell, many, of, its, interests, kodak, s,
