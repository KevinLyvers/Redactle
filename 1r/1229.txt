while, wealthy, merchants, and, gentry, enjoyed, a, life, of, splendor, the, majority, of, peasants, and, day, laborers, continued, to, live, in, poverty, the, closing, decade, of, the, 16th, century, was, marked, by, three, major, campaigns, a, large, rebellion, in, ningxia, was, quelled, by, a, ming, force, of, 40, 000, soldiers, by, october, 1592, allowing, them, to, shift, their, focus, to,

empire, however, this, effort, was, abandoned, in, 1606, as, a, result, the, governance, of, the, country, remained, in, the, hands, of, confucian, intellectuals, who, were, often, embroiled, in, disputes, with, each, other, the, opposition, donglin, movement, continued, to, criticize, the, emperor, and, his, followers, while, pro, government, officials, were, divided, based, on, their,

become, a, devoted, adviser, to, the, young, emperor, the, wanli, emperor, was, known, for, his, restless, and, energetic, nature, during, his, youth, he, was, described, as, a, quick, learner, intelligent, and, perceptive, always, staying, well, informed, about, the, happenings, in, the, empire, zhang, juzheng, assigned, eight, teachers, to, educate, the, wanli, emperor, in, confucianism, history, and, calligraphy, the, history, lessons, focused, on, teaching, him, about, good, and, bad, examples, of, governance, and, zhang, juzheng, personally, compiled, a, collection, of, historical, stories, for, the, emperor, to, learn, from, however, the, wanli, emperor, s, fascination, with, calligraphy, concerned, zhang, who, feared, that, this, empty, pastime, would, distract, him, from, his, duties, as, a, statesman, as, a, result, zhang, gradually, stopped, the, wanli, emperor, s, calligraphy, lessons, from, 1583, to, 1588, the, wanli, emperor, visited, several, mausoleums, near, beijing, and, paid, attention, to, the, training, of, the, palace, guard, however, his, mother, zhang, juzheng, and, high, ranking, officials, in, beijing, were, worried, that, he, would, become, a, ruler, similar, to, the, zhengde, emperor, reigned, 1505, 1521, and, discouraged, him, from, traveling, outside, the, forbidden, city, and, pursuing, his, interests, in, the, military, horse, riding, and, archery, under, their, pressure, the, wanli, emperor, stopped, leaving, beijing, after, 1588, and, stopped, participating, in, public, sacrifices, after, 1591, he, also, canceled, the, morning, audience, held, before, dawn, and, the, evening, study, of, confucianism, after, sunset, in, his, youth, the, wanli, emperor, was, obedient, to, his, mother, and, showed, respect, towards, eunuchs, and, the, grand, secretaries, however, as, he, grew, older, he, became, cynical, and, skeptical, towards, rituals, and, bureaucrats, his, opposition, to, ritualized, royal, duties, linked, him, to, his, grandfather, the, jiajing, emperor, reigned, 1521, 1567, but, he, lacked, the, jiajing, emperor, s, decisiveness, and, flamboyance, instead, of, the, jiajing, emperor, s, passion, for, taoism, the, wanli, emperor, leaned, towards, buddhism, in, the, first, period, of, his, rule, he, displayed, a, strong, commitment, to, the, well, being, of, his, people, actively, combating, corruption, and, striving, to, improve, border, defense, his, mother, a, devout, buddhist, had, a, significant, influence, on, him, leading, him, to, rarely, impose, the, death, penalty, however, one, punished, official, claimed, that, his, leniency, was, sometimes, excessive, despite, this, he, was, not, afraid, to, use, violence, against, offending, officials, although, he, did, not, make, it, a, regular, practice, he, was, known, to, be, both, vulnerable, and, vengeful, but, also, generous, however, since, the, mid, 1580s, he, began, to, gain, weight, and, his, health, deteriorated, in, 1589, he, cited, long, term, dizziness, accompanied, by, fevers, heatstroke, eczema, diarrhea, and, general, weakness, as, reasons, for, his, absence, from, audiences, it, is, believed, that, his, health, issues, were, linked, to, his, regular, use, of, opium, zhang, juzheng, and, his, mother, raised, the, wanli, emperor, to, be, modest, in, material, possessions, and, exemplary, in, behavior, which, he, saw, as, a, humiliation, that, he, never, forgot, however, upon, learning, that, zhang, juzheng, himself, lived, in, luxury, the, wanli, emperor, was, deeply, affected, this, display, of, double, standards, hardened, his, attitude, towards, officials, and, made, him, cynical, about, moral, challenges, two, years, after, zhang, juzheng, s, death, his, family, was, accused, of, illegal, land, dealings, and, the, wanli, emperor, severely, punished, them, by, confiscating, their, property, and, sending, zhang, s, sons, to, the, border, troops, at, the, end, of, the, longqing, emperor, s, reign, the, grand, secretariat, and, government, were, headed, by, senior, grand, secretary, and, minister, of, rites, gao, gong, however, after, the, wanli, emperor, s, accession, the, eunuch, feng, bao, head, of, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, the, most, important, eunuch, office, in, the, imperial, palace, worked, with, grand, secretary, zhang, juzheng, to, depose, gao, gong, zhang, juzheng, then, took, over, as, head, of, the, grand, secretariat, and, remained, in, power, for, ten, years, until, his, death, in, 1582, in, response, to, the, mongol, raids, in, the, 1550s, zhang, aimed, to, enrich, the, country, and, strengthen, the, army, using, legalistic, methods, rather, than, confucian, ones, he, sought, to, centralize, the, government, and, increase, the, emperor, s, authority, at, the, expense, of, local, interests, by, streamlining, the, administration, and, strengthening, the, military, this, included, closing, local, academies, and, placing, the, investigating, censors, under, the, grand, secretariat, s, control, zhang, had, the, support, of, eunuchs, particularly, feng, bao, and, the, emperor, s, mother, who, acted, as, regent, he, was, able, to, handpick, his, colleagues, in, the, grand, secretariat, and, informally, control, the, ministry, of, rites, and, the, censorate, appointing, his, followers, to, important, positions, in, central, offices, and, regions, this, gave, him, significant, influence, in, the, government, although, he, did, not, have, the, authority, to, issue, orders, or, demands, zhang, also, attempted, to, redirect, the, control, officials, from, seeking, revenge, against, each, other, and, instead, focus, on, collecting, taxes, and, suppressing, bandits, as, a, result, the, efficiency, of, the, ming, state, administration, improved, between, 1572, and, 1582, reaching, a, level, that, had, only, been, achieved, in, the, early, days, of, the, empire, zhang, juzheng, implemented, a, series, of, reforms, during, his, time, in, office, including, the, conversion, of, tax, payments, from, goods, to, silver, known, as, the, single, whip, reform, changes, to, the, military, peasant, system, and, between, 1572, and, 1579, revised, the, accounts, of, county, offices, regarding, corv, e, labor, and, various, fees, and, surcharges, in, 1580, 1582, a, new, cadastre, was, also, created, these, reforms, were, formalized, across, the, empire, with, the, publication, of, revised, lists, of, taxpayers, duties, now, converted, to, a, unified, payment, in, silver, as, part, of, the, administrative, reforms, unnecessary, activities, were, abolished, or, limited, the, number, of, confucian, students, receiving, state, support, was, reduced, and, provincial, authorities, were, urged, to, only, require, one, third, of, the, previous, amount, of, corv, e, labor, additionally, the, services, provided, by, post, offices, were, reduced, despite, these, changes, taxes, remained, at, their, original, level, and, tax, arrears, were, strictly, enforced, zhang, juzheng, was, able, to, accumulate, a, surplus, of, income, over, expenditure, this, was, a, significant, achievement, as, the, ming, state, typically, operated, without, reserves, in, the, 16th, century, however, zhang, juzheng, s, administration, was, able, to, save, money, and, improve, tax, collection, resulting, in, considerable, reserves, in, 1582, the, granaries, around, the, capital, held, nine, years, worth, of, grain, the, treasury, of, the, ministry, of, revenue, contained, 6, million, liang, about, 223, tons, of, silver, the, court, of, the, imperial, stud, held, another, 4, million, and, an, additional, 2, 5, million, was, available, in, nanjing, smaller, reserves, were, also, available, to, provincial, administrations, in, sichuan, zhejiang, and, guangxi, despite, these, achievements, there, were, no, institutional, changes, during, zhang, juzheng, s, time, in, office, he, simply, made, existing, processes, more, efficient, under, the, slogan, of, returning, to, the, order, from, the, beginnings, of, the, empire, as, a, proponent, of, peace, with, the, mongols, zhang, juzheng, rejected, the, proposal, of, minister, of, war, tan, lun, for, a, pre, emptive, strike, against, them, instead, he, ordered, qi, jiguang, commander, of, the, northeastern, border, to, maintain, an, armed, peace, this, decision, not, only, allowed, for, a, reduction, in, the, border, army, but, also, resulted, in, the, return, of, surplus, soldiers, to, their, family, farms, zhang, juzheng, not, only, rejected, the, notion, that, military, affairs, were, less, important, than, civilian, ones, but, also, challenged, the, dominance, of, civilian, dignitaries, over, military, leaders, he, appointed, capable, military, leaders, such, as, qi, jiguang, wang, chonggu, tan, lun, liang, menglong, and, li, chengliang, to, positions, of, responsibility, additionally, he, implemented, a, combination, of, defensive, and, offensive, measures, to, strengthen, border, defenses, and, fostered, peaceful, relations, with, neighboring, countries, by, opening, border, markets, particularly, in, the, northwest, zhang, juzheng, s, actions, were, within, the, bounds, of, existing, legislation, but, critics, viewed, them, as, an, abuse, of, power, to, promote, his, followers, and, exert, illegitimate, pressure, on, officials, however, open, criticism, was, rare, until, his, father, s, death, in, 1577, according, to, the, law, zhang, was, supposed, to, leave, office, due, to, mourning, but, the, emperor, chose, to, keep, him, in, office, this, was, not, unprecedented, but, criticism, of, disrespect, for, parents, was, widespread, despite, the, fact, that, the, most, vocal, critics, were, punished, with, beatings, zhang, juzheng, s, reputation, was, damaged, in, an, attempt, to, suppress, opposition, zhang, then, enforced, an, extraordinary, self, evaluation, of, all, high, ranking, officials, resulting, in, the, elimination, of, around, fifty, opponents, zhang, juzheng, died, on, 9, july, 1582, after, his, death, he, was, accused, of, the, typical, offenses, of, high, officials, including, bribery, living, in, luxury, promoting, unqualified, supporters, abusing, power, and, silencing, critics, after, zhang, juzheng, s, death, his, followers, among, the, officials, were, dismissed, and, in, the, beginning, of, 1583, feng, bao, also, lost, his, position, however, the, emperor, protected, the, officers, which, boosted, their, morale, to, a, level, not, seen, since, the, mid, 15th, century, the, wanli, emperor, s, more, aggressive, military, policy, was, based, on, zhang, s, successes, as, he, attempted, to, replace, static, defense, with, more, offensive, tactics, and, appointed, only, officials, with, military, experience, to, lead, the, ministry, of, war, the, emperor, also, shared, zhang, juzheng, s, distrust, of, local, and, regional, authorities, and, opposition, to, factional, politics, like, zhang, juzheng, the, wanli, emperor, preferred, to, solve, real, problems, rather, than, engage, in, empty, talk, and, factional, conflicts, after, zhang, s, death, a, coalition, formed, between, the, emperor, s, mother, the, grand, secretaries, the, ministry, of, personnel, and, the, censorate, to, ensure, efficient, administration, of, the, empire, this, alliance, was, opposed, by, the, opposition, who, deemed, it, illegal, however, with, the, absence, of, a, strong, statesman, in, the, grand, secretariat, there, was, no, one, to, bring, the, administration, under, control, both, the, emperor, and, opposition, officials, feared, the, concentration, of, power, in, the, grand, secretariat, and, worked, to, prevent, it, from, 1582, to, 1591, the, grand, secretariat, was, briefly, led, by, zhang, siwei, and, then, for, eight, years, by, shen, shixing, shen, shixing, attempted, to, find, compromises, between, the, monarch, and, the, bureaucracy, while, also, tolerating, criticism, and, respecting, the, decisions, of, ministries, and, the, censors, however, his, efforts, to, create, a, cooperative, and, cohesive, atmosphere, were, unsuccessful, in, 1590, the, grand, secretariat, s, alliance, with, the, leadership, of, the, ministry, of, personnel, and, the, censorate, fell, apart, causing, shen, shixing, to, lose, much, of, his, influence, he, was, eventually, forced, to, resign, in, 1591, due, to, his, approach, to, the, succession, issue, which, had, lost, him, the, confidence, of, opposition, officials, after, 1582, the, emperor, chose, the, leaders, of, the, grand, secretariat, from, among, the, opponents, of, zhang, juzheng, after, shen, shixing, the, position, was, held, by, wang, jiaping, wang, xijue, and, zhao, zhigao, until, 1601, except, for, the, short, lived, wang, jiaping, all, of, zhang, s, successors, including, shen, yiguan, zhu, geng, li, tingji, ye, xianggao, and, fang, congzhe, fell, out, of, favor, and, were, either, accused, by, censors, during, their, lifetime, or, posthumously, the, anti, zhang, opposition, led, by, gu, xiancheng, was, successful, in, condemning, him, and, purging, his, followers, from, the, bureaucracy, after, his, death, however, this, also, created, an, opportunity, for, the, censors, to, criticize, higher, ranking, officials, which, angered, the, monarch, and, caused, dissatisfaction, because, the, critics, did, not, offer, any, positive, solutions, as, a, result, zhang, s, opponents, became, embroiled, in, numerous, disputes, hindering, the, restoration, of, a, strong, centralized, government, from, 1585, the, censors, also, began, to, criticize, the, emperor, s, private, life, this, criticism, was, fueled, by, the, emperor, s, reluctance, to, impose, harsh, punishments, which, emboldened, the, critics, in, response, the, wanli, emperor, tried, to, silence, their, informers, among, his, servants, and, gradually, stopped, responding, to, comments, about, himself, however, in, 1588, the, wanli, emperor, s, censors, accused, him, of, accepting, a, bribe, from, one, of, his, eunuchs, which, shocked, the, emperor, and, caused, him, to, withdraw, from, cooperating, with, officials, he, reduced, his, contact, with, them, to, a, minimum, and, canceled, the, morning, audience, he, only, appeared, in, public, at, celebrations, of, military, victories, and, communication, with, the, bureaucracy, was, done, through, written, reports, to, which, he, may, or, may, not, have, responded, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, he, also, hindered, personnel, changes, in, offices, leaving, positions, vacant, and, allowing, officials, to, leave, without, his, written, consent, which, was, illegal, but, went, unpunished, as, a, result, by, 1603, nine, positions, of, regional, inspectors, out, of, 13, were, vacant, for, a, long, time, and, in, 1604, almost, half, of, the, prefects, and, over, half, of, the, ministers, and, deputy, ministers, in, both, capitals, were, vacant, the, emperor, also, deliberately, left, many, positions, vacant, in, the, eunuch, offices, of, the, palace, particularly, the, position, of, head, of, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, in, an, attempt, to, weaken, communication, between, eunuchs, and, officials, this, also, resulted, in, significant, financial, savings, from, unoccupied, seats, the, emperor, s, lack, of, involvement, in, official, positions, did, not, affect, the, administration, s, responsibility, for, tax, collection, in, times, of, military, or, other, serious, issues, he, sought, advice, from, responsible, officials, in, ministries, and, the, censorate, and, was, not, hesitant, to, appoint, capable, individuals, outside, of, the, traditional, hierarchy, to, handle, the, situation, however, he, had, a, lack, of, trust, in, the, regular, administration, and, often, found, ways, to, bypass, it, while, he, may, have, left, some, memoranda, unanswered, he, actively, responded, to, others, despite, leaving, some, high, positions, vacant, the, authorities, were, able, to, function, under, the, guidance, of, deputies, and, the, country, s, administration, continued, to, run, smoothly, assistance, was, provided, to, those, affected, by, famine, rebellions, were, suppressed, border, conflicts, were, resolved, and, infrastructure, was, maintained, hundreds, of, memoranda, arrived, on, the, wanli, emperor, s, desk, daily, but, he, only, read, and, decided, on, a, handful, of, them, the, rest, were, handled, by, commissioned, eunuchs, who, were, equipped, with, the, imperial, red, brush, these, eunuchs, mostly, confirmed, the, recommendations, and, proposals, of, the, grand, secretaries, but, occasionally, made, different, decisions, if, they, believed, the, emperor, would, not, agree, with, the, grand, secretaries, proposals, despite, his, desire, to, reform, the, civil, service, the, emperor, was, unable, to, do, so, and, he, also, did, not, want, to, simply, confirm, the, decisions, of, the, officials, both, sides, the, emperor, and, the, bureaucrats, wanted, the, other, to, behave, properly, but, their, efforts, were, unsuccessful, and, only, served, to, paralyze, each, other, as, a, result, of, these, disputes, at, the, center, the, state, s, control, over, the, countryside, weakened, in, 1586, the, issue, of, succession, arose, when, the, emperor, elevated, his, favorite, concubine, lady, zheng, to, the, rank, of, imperial, noble, consort, huang, guifei, placing, her, only, one, rank, below, the, empress, and, above, all, other, concubines, including, lady, wang, mother, of, the, emperor, s, eldest, son, zhu, changluo, 1582, 1620, this, made, it, clear, to, those, around, him, that, he, favored, the, son, of, lady, zheng, zhu, changxun, 1586, 1641, his, third, son, the, second, had, died, in, infancy, over, zhu, changluo, as, his, successor, this, caused, a, division, among, the, bureaucracy, some, officials, defended, the, rights, of, the, first, son, based, on, legal, primogeniture, while, others, aligned, themselves, with, lady, zheng, s, son, in, response, to, the, widespread, support, for, the, eldest, son, s, rights, among, officials, the, emperor, postponed, his, decision, he, justified, the, delay, by, stating, that, he, was, waiting, for, a, son, from, the, empress, when, asked, to, appoint, zhu, changluo, as, the, crown, prince, at, the, age, of, eight, so, that, his, education, could, officially, begin, the, emperor, again, defended, himself, by, saying, that, princes, were, traditionally, taught, by, eunuchs, in, 1589, the, emperor, agreed, to, appoint, zhu, changluo, as, his, successor, however, this, decision, was, opposed, by, lady, zheng, causing, a, wave, of, controversy, and, two, years, later, even, arrests, when, a, pamphlet, accusing, her, of, conspiring, with, high, officials, against, the, emperor, s, eldest, son, spread, in, beijing, in, an, attempt, to, improve, her, public, image, the, emperor, made, efforts, to, portray, lady, zheng, in, a, favorable, light, this, reached, its, peak, in, 1594, when, he, supported, her, efforts, to, aid, the, victims, of, a, famine, in, henan, he, ordered, all, beijing, officials, of, the, fifth, rank, and, above, to, contribute, to, her, cause, from, their, incomes, the, failure, to, appoint, a, successor, sparked, frequent, protests, from, both, opposition, minded, officials, and, high, dignitaries, such, as, grand, secretaries, shen, shixing, in, office, 1578, 91, and, wang, xijue, in, office, 1584, 91, and, 1593, 94, the, rights, of, zhu, changluo, were, also, supported, by, the, empress, and, the, emperor, s, mother, however, it, was, not, until, 1601, after, facing, pressure, from, another, round, of, protests, and, requests, that, wanli, finally, appointed, zhu, changluo, as, crown, prince, at, the, same, time, zhu, changxun, was, given, the, title, of, prince, of, fu, but, he, was, kept, in, beijing, instead, of, being, sent, to, the, province, as, originally, planned, when, he, turned, eighteen, in, 1604, this, fueled, rumors, that, the, question, of, succession, was, still, unresolved, it, was, not, until, 1614, after, numerous, appeals, and, protests, against, inaction, that, the, emperor, finally, sent, the, prince, to, his, provincial, seat, this, decision, was, only, made, after, the, emperor, s, mother, firmly, advocated, for, it, related, to, the, succession, debates, was, the, case, of, the, wooden, staff, assault, which, greatly, damaged, the, ruler, s, reputation, in, late, may, 1615, a, man, with, a, wooden, staff, was, detained, at, the, crown, prince, s, palace, from, the, subsequent, investigation, it, was, discovered, that, the, man, zhang, chai, was, mentally, unstable, and, had, attempted, to, use, his, wooden, staff, to, settle, a, dispute, with, two, eunuchs, initially, it, was, decided, that, he, would, be, executed, to, resolve, the, issue, however, wang, zhicai, a, prison, official, intervened, and, disputed, the, claim, that, zhang, chai, was, insane, he, pushed, for, a, public, investigation, involving, the, ministry, of, justice, this, new, version, of, events, suggested, that, zhang, chai, was, actually, of, sound, mind, and, had, been, invited, into, the, palace, by, two, eunuchs, close, to, lady, zheng, and, her, brother, this, raised, suspicions, that, their, true, intention, was, to, assassinate, the, crown, prince, and, replace, him, with, lady, zheng, s, son, this, caused, quite, a, stir, at, court, in, response, the, wanli, emperor, took, the, unprecedented, step, of, summoning, all, civilian, and, military, officials, employed, in, beijing, and, appearing, before, them, with, his, family, the, crown, prince, his, sons, and, daughter, he, scolded, the, officials, for, doubting, his, relationship, with, the, crown, prince, whom, he, trusted, and, relied, on, the, crown, prince, himself, confirmed, their, close, relationship, and, requested, an, end, to, the, matter, ultimately, the, emperor, decided, to, execute, zhang, chai, and, the, two, eunuchs, involved, in, the, case, however, officials, from, the, ministry, of, justice, opposed, the, execution, and, demanded, further, investigation, a, compromise, was, reached, through, the, mediation, of, the, grand, secretaries, zhang, chai, was, executed, the, following, day, while, the, suspected, eunuchs, were, to, be, interrogated, the, interrogation, did, take, place, but, both, eunuchs, remained, under, the, supervision, of, the, emperor, s, eunuchs, on, the, fifth, day, after, the, emperor, s, speech, the, officials, were, informed, that, the, eunuchs, had, died, the, case, then, quieted, down, in, august, 1596, due, to, poor, tax, collection, and, the, depletion, of, the, treasury, from, the, costly, restoration, of, the, forbidden, city, palaces, destroyed, by, fire, in, april, of, that, year, the, wanli, emperor, made, the, decision, to, accept, proposals, for, silver, mining, that, had, been, suggested, by, lower, level, administrators, for, several, years, he, dispatched, a, team, consisting, of, eunuchs, imperial, guard, officers, and, representatives, from, the, ministry, of, revenue, to, the, outskirts, of, beijing, to, establish, new, silver, mines, he, also, sent, an, imperial, guard, officer, to, henan, province, with, the, same, task, and, within, a, few, weeks, other, officers, and, eunuchs, were, sent, to, shandong, shaanxi, zhejiang, and, shanxi, provinces, there, was, a, long, standing, tradition, of, sending, eunuchs, to, various, regions, as, the, business, trade, and, mining, industries, provided, opportunities, for, them, to, earn, income, however, within, a, few, days, this, initiative, was, met, with, opposition, from, local, authorities, in, beijing, who, raised, concerns, about, the, potential, threat, to, imperial, tombs, in, the, mountains, near, beijing, and, the, difficulty, of, recruiting, miners, who, were, still, engaged, in, illegal, mining, in, response, the, emperor, designated, a, protective, zone, for, the, tombs, but, did, not, cancel, the, mining, operation, he, also, appointed, wealthy, individuals, from, the, local, gentry, to, manage, the, mines, and, oversee, necessary, investments, confucian, officials, who, were, concerned, about, the, erosion, of, their, authority, opposed, the, emperor, s, initiative, on, ideological, grounds, as, they, believed, that, the, state, should, not, engage, in, business, and, compete, with, the, people, for, profit, they, also, objected, to, the, emperor, s, involvement, in, the, mining, industry, as, it, required, the, employment, of, miners, who, were, considered, untrustworthy, and, derogatorily, referred, to, as, mining, bandits, another, reason, for, the, gentry, and, officials, opposition, was, the, fact, that, eunuchs, a, rival, power, group, were, in, charge, of, the, mining, operations, furthermore, mining, for, silver, was, a, complex, task, that, required, expertise, and, skills, that, the, emperor, s, eunuchs, did, not, possess, to, address, this, issue, the, emperor, appointed, wealthy, local, individuals, as, mine, managers, who, were, responsible, for, paying, the, mining, tax, and, delivering, the, silver, regardless, of, the, profitability, of, the, mine, as, a, result, the, mining, of, silver, shifted, from, underground, to, the, coffers, of, the, wealthy, effectively, taxing, them, american, historian, harry, miller, bluntly, described, wan, li, s, actions, as, an, economic, war, against, the, wealthy, after, the, war, in, korea, reignited, in, 1597, the, emperor, made, increased, efforts, to, raise, additional, funds, due, to, his, lack, of, trust, in, the, gentry, he, began, to, establish, an, alternative, eunuch, regional, administration, gradually, the, mining, tax, commissioners, kuangshi, literally, mining, envoy, gained, control, over, the, collection, of, trade, and, other, taxes, in, addition, to, the, mining, tax, kuangshui, which, was, officially, approved, by, the, emperor, in, 1598, 1599, the, emperor, granted, these, commissioners, the, authority, to, supervise, the, county, and, prefectural, authorities, and, even, the, grand, coordinators, as, a, result, the, imperial, commissioners, no, longer, had, to, consider, the, opinions, of, local, civil, or, military, authorities, instead, they, could, assign, tasks, to, them, and, even, imprison, them, if, they, resisted, while, the, emperor, disregarded, the, protests, of, officials, against, the, mining, tax, and, the, actions, of, the, eunuchs, he, closely, monitored, the, reports, and, proposals, of, the, eunuchs, and, responded, promptly, often, on, the, same, day, they, arrived, in, beijing, in, 1599, he, dispatched, eunuchs, to, major, ports, where, they, took, over, the, powers, of, official, civil, administration, the, emperor, finally, resolved, disputes, with, officials, defending, their, powers, in, the, spring, of, 1599, by, officially, transferring, the, collection, of, taxes, to, mining, commissioners, this, expansion, of, eunuch, powers, and, their, operations, earned, the, emperor, a, reputation, among, confucian, oriented, intellectuals, as, one, of, the, most, avaricious, rulers, in, chinese, history, constantly, seeking, ways, to, fill, his, personal, coffers, at, the, expense, of, government, revenue, according, to, american, historian, richard, von, glahn, tax, revenue, from, silver, mines, increased, significantly, from, a, few, hundred, kilograms, per, year, before, 1597, to, an, average, of, 3, 650, kg, per, year, in, 1597, 1606, in, the, most, successful, year, of, 1603, the, revenue, reached, 6, 650, kg, accounting, for, approximately, 30, of, mining, according, to, estimates, by, modern, chinese, historians, wang, chunyu, and, du, wanyan, the, mining, tax, earned, the, state, an, additional, 3, million, liang, 110, tons, of, silver, with, the, eunuch, commissioners, retaining, eight, or, nine, times, more, another, estimate, suggests, that, in, 1596, 1606, the, mine, commissioners, supplied, the, state, with, at, least, 5, 96, million, liang, of, silver, but, kept, 40, 50, million, for, themselves, while, officials, commonly, profited, from, their, positions, eunuchs, were, known, to, pocket, a, significantly, larger, portion, of, the, collected, funds, at, the, turn, of, the, years, 1605, 1606, the, emperor, realized, that, not, only, gentry, officials, but, also, eunuchs, were, corrupt, he, also, recognized, that, the, mining, tax, was, causing, more, harm, than, good, as, a, result, in, january, 1606, he, made, the, decision, to, abandon, the, attempt, at, alternative, administration, and, issued, an, edict, to, abolish, state, mining, operations, tax, collection, was, then, returned, to, the, traditional, authorities, the, gentry, not, only, suffered, financially, from, the, eunuchs, actions, but, also, lost, control, over, the, financial, transactions, between, the, people, and, the, state, this, loss, of, control, was, a, significant, blow, to, their, perceived, dominance, over, the, people, it, was, a, humiliating, experience, and, disrupted, the, natural, order, of, things, however, by, 1606, the, gentry, regained, their, dominance, over, both, the, people, and, the, state, as, a, whole, in, the, ming, administrative, system, ultimate, authority, rested, with, the, monarch, however, it, required, an, energetic, and, competent, ruler, to, effectively, carry, out, this, power, in, cases, where, the, ruler, was, not, capable, the, system, of, checks, and, balances, resulted, in, collective, leadership, this, was, due, to, the, dispersion, of, power, among, various, authorities, in, the, mid, 15th, century, a, system, of, collective, debates, huiguan, tuiju, literally, to, rally, officials, and, to, recommend, collectively, was, established, to, address, issues, that, were, beyond, the, scope, of, one, department, these, gatherings, involved, dozens, of, officials, discussing, political, and, personnel, matters, as, a, result, the, importance, of, public, opinion, gonglun, grew, and, the, autocratic, power, of, the, monarch, was, limited, during, the, wanli, emperor, s, reign, one, of, the, issues, that, was, resolved, collectively, was, the, appointment, of, high, state, dignitaries, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, zhang, juzheng, successfully, abolished, collective, debates, giving, the, emperor, the, power, to, appoint, high, officials, based, on, his, own, suggestions, however, after, zhang, s, death, the, debates, were, reinstated, and, the, emperor, s, power, was, once, again, limited, despite, this, wanli, attempted, to, overcome, these, restrictions, such, as, in, 1591, when, he, announced, his, decision, to, appoint, the, current, minister, of, rites, zhao, zhigao, as, senior, grand, secretary, without, consulting, with, other, officials, this, decision, was, met, with, criticism, from, minister, of, personnel, lu, guangzu, who, argued, that, it, violated, proper, procedure, and, undermined, the, fairness, and, credibility, of, the, government, s, decision, making, processes, lu, and, others, believed, that, collective, consideration, of, candidates, in, open, public, debate, was, a, more, impartial, and, fair, method, as, it, eliminated, individual, bias, and, ignorance, in, response, to, the, criticism, the, emperor, partially, retreated, and, promised, to, follow, the, proper, procedure, in, the, future, however, he, continued, to, occasionally, appoint, high, dignitaries, without, collective, debate, which, always, sparked, protests, from, officials, in, the, late, ming, period, there, was, a, widespread, belief, that, public, opinion, held, more, weight, than, individual, opinions, this, was, evident, in, the, way, political, and, administrative, issues, were, addressed, with, decision, making, being, based, on, gathering, information, and, opinions, from, officials, through, questionnaires, and, voting, ballots, this, also, had, an, impact, on, the, evaluation, of, officials, as, their, performance, began, to, be, judged, not, only, by, their, superiors, but, also, by, the, wider, community, in, 1595, minister, of, personnel, sun, piyang, conducted, a, questionnaire, survey, on, the, conditions, of, several, offices, and, used, the, results, to, persuade, the, wanli, emperor, to, dismiss, a, certain, official, from, zhejiang, the, survey, had, received, a, large, number, of, negative, comments, including, accusations, of, corruption, and, other, crimes, this, unprecedented, event, sparked, a, heated, debate, with, zhao, zhigao, arguing, that, anonymous, questionnaires, should, not, be, the, main, criteria, for, evaluation, and, that, no, one, should, be, accused, of, criminal, offenses, based, on, unverified, information, from, anonymous, sources, sun, defended, himself, by, stating, that, solid, evidence, against, the, individual, was, not, necessary, as, they, were, not, being, accused, or, standing, trial, he, believed, that, in, evaluating, officials, it, was, sufficient, for, him, to, impartially, discover, the, widely, held, opinion, of, the, individual, s, recklessness, through, the, survey, the, reform, of, civil, servant, evaluations, resulted, in, their, careers, being, dependent, on, their, reputation, as, determined, by, the, ministry, and, censors, through, anonymous, surveys, filled, out, by, their, colleagues, this, shift, along, with, collective, debates, elevated, the, significance, of, public, opinion, during, the, wanli, emperor, s, reign, leading, to, intense, public, debates, and, conflicts, as, groups, of, officials, vied, for, control, of, public, opinion, while, the, monarch, s, authority, and, the, weight, of, his, voice, declined, in, 1604, gu, xiancheng, with, the, suggestion, of, his, friend, gao, panlong, established, the, donglin, academy, in, wuxi, located, in, jiangnan, the, academy, served, as, a, hub, for, discussions, and, meetings, with, the, support, of, local, authorities, and, the, gentry, the, academy, quickly, gained, prominence, as, the, founders, had, been, out, of, politics, for, many, years, the, government, did, not, view, it, as, a, threat, the, academy, attracted, hundreds, of, intellectuals, and, soon, became, a, significant, intellectual, center, in, all, of, china, it, also, inspired, the, creation, of, similar, centers, in, nearby, prefectures, forming, a, network, of, associations, and, circles, according, to, the, academy, they, was, a, group, of, officials, who, advocated, for, strict, adherence, to, confucian, morality, the, supporters, of, the, donglin, movement, believed, that, living, an, exemplary, life, was, essential, for, cultivating, moral, character, and, they, did, not, differentiate, between, private, and, public, morality, they, believed, that, one, s, moral, cultivation, should, begin, with, the, mind, heart, then, extend, to, one, s, home, surroundings, and, public, life, this, belief, was, exemplified, by, gao, panlong, however, they, viewed, zhang, juzheng, s, decision, to, not, mourn, for, his, father, as, a, sign, of, being, an, unprincipled, profiteer, they, also, criticized, the, emperor, for, hesitating, to, confirm, the, succession, of, his, eldest, son, considering, it, unethical, and, unacceptable, the, donhlin, movement, promoted, a, system, of, government, based, on, confucian, values, particularly, the, values, of, the, patriarchal, family, which, were, extended, to, the, entire, state, they, believed, that, the, local, administration, should, be, led, by, the, educated, gentry, who, would, guide, the, people, in, this, context, the, technical, aspects, of, governance, were, considered, unimportant, and, any, issues, with, the, organization, of, administration, were, addressed, by, promoting, confucian, virtues, preaching, morality, and, emphasizing, self, sacrifice, for, higher, goals, disputes, within, the, movement, centered, around, moral, values, and, qualities, with, opponents, being, accused, of, immoral, behavior, rather, than, professional, incompetence, the, emphasis, on, morality, allowed, the, donglin, movement, to, claim, that, they, were, not, pursuing, selfish, goals, but, were, united, by, universal, and, true, moral, principles, although, the, leaders, of, the, movement, did, not, return, to, office, until, the, end, of, the, wanli, emperor, s, reign, it, had, a, significant, influence, among, junior, officials, in, beijing, they, opposed, the, concentration, of, power, in, the, grand, secretariat, and, the, ministries, advocating, for, the, independence, of, the, censorate, they, also, called, for, limitations, on, the, activities, of, eunuchs, within, the, imperial, palace, their, stance, on, succession, was, based, on, principles, arguing, that, the, ruler, does, not, have, the, right, to, unilaterally, change, fundamental, laws, of, the, empire, including, succession, rules, however, their, emphasis, on, decentralization, and, prioritizing, morality, and, ideology, over, pragmatism, hindered, effective, governance, of, the, empire, which, was, already, challenging, due, to, its, size, and, population, the, tendency, to, equate, personal, virtue, with, administrative, talent, led, to, morality, becoming, the, main, target, in, factional, disputes, the, regular, evaluation, of, the, capital, officials, was, often, used, to, eliminate, opponents, in, 1577, zhang, juzheng, used, this, type, of, evaluation, for, the, first, time, resulting, in, the, removal, of, 51, of, his, opponents, another, evaluation, in, 1581, led, to, the, dismissal, of, 264, officials, in, the, capital, and, 67, in, nanjing, which, was, a, significant, purge, considering, that, during, the, late, ming, period, there, were, over, a, thousand, officials, serving, in, the, central, government, in, beijing, and, almost, four, hundred, in, nanjing, in, 1587, only, 31, jinshi, were, removed, by, gand, secretary, shen, shixing, but, none, from, the, ministry, of, personnel, the, hanlin, academy, and, the, censorate, where, factional, disputes, were, common, however, censors, also, demanded, the, dismissal, of, the, minister, of, works, he, qiming, apparently, for, political, reasons, as, a, supporter, of, zhang, juzheng, just, a, month, after, his, appointment, which, angered, the, emperor, the, minister, was, forced, to, leave, and, the, emperor, also, dismissed, the, head, of, the, censorate, and, transferred, the, responsible, inspectors, to, the, provinces, this, sparked, protests, against, the, emperor, s, interference, in, the, independence, of, the, censorate, in, the, 1593, evaluation, the, donglins, utilized, their, positions, in, the, ministry, of, personnel, and, the, censorate, to, eliminate, the, followers, of, the, grand, secretaries, the, newly, appointed, senior, grand, secretary, wang, xijue, was, unable, to, support, his, party, members, he, did, however, request, the, dismissal, of, several, organizers, of, the, purge, during, additional, evaluations, the, head, of, the, censorate, opposed, this, but, the, emperor, ultimately, agreed, sparking, further, protests, from, junior, officials, including, future, founders, of, the, donglin, academy, by, the, time, of, the, 1599, evaluation, the, donglin, opposition, had, lost, its, influence, resulting, in, a, more, peaceful, evaluation, f, the, however, in, the, 1605, evaluation, the, donglin, movement, once, again, attacked, their, opponents, and, through, wen, chun, the, head, of, the, censorate, and, yang, shiqiao, vice, minister, of, personnel, demanded, the, dismissal, of, 207, officials, from, the, capital, and, 73, from, nanjing, however, the, emperor, did, not, agree, to, such, a, large, scale, purge, and, explicitly, stated, that, several, of, the, accused, officials, should, remain, in, their, positions, this, was, an, unprecedented, refusal, and, sparked, sharp, criticism, leading, to, a, months, long, debate, filled, with, mutual, recriminations, even, heaven, seemed, to, intervene, when, lightning, struck, the, temple, of, heaven, eventually, the, accused, officials, were, forced, to, resign, but, so, were, the, organizers, of, the, purge, including, grand, secretary, shen, yiguan, the, following, year, while, the, donglins, were, successful, in, dismissing, their, opponents, they, did, not, have, suitable, candidates, for, top, positions, and, even, when, a, candidate, like, li, sancai, emerged, he, was, thwarted, in, the, same, way, through, an, attack, on, his, moral, integrity, in, li, s, case, through, bribery, this, was, also, the, first, instance, where, a, connection, to, the, donglin, movement, was, used, as, an, argument, against, a, candidate, in, the, 1611, evaluation, two, anti, donglin, factions, clashed, resulting, in, the, downfall, of, their, leaders, tang, binyin, chancellor, of, nanking, university, and, gu, tianjun, teacher, of, the, heir, apparent, the, career, of, the, highest, ranking, donglin, sympathizer, vice, minister, of, personnel, and, hanlin, academy, scholar, wang, tu, was, also, ruined, in, the, 1617, evaluation, three, cliques, based, on, regional, origin, were, in, conflict, formed, by, anti, donglin, censors, in, the, last, decade, of, the, wanli, emperor, s, reign, the, spineless, bureaucrat, fang, congzhe, led, the, grand, secretariat, while, the, emperor, left, many, high, administrative, positions, vacant, for, long, periods, and, simply, ignored, polemical, memoranda, the, years, 1570, 1620, were, relatively, warm, especially, in, winter, with, an, average, temperature, one, degree, higher, than, the, previous, half, century, however, the, weather, was, also, drier, leading, to, occasional, flooding, this, trend, was, particularly, evident, in, the, years, 1585, 1589, and, 1614, 1619, which, experienced, severe, droughts, on, the, other, hand, cold, winters, were, recorded, in, 1595, 1598, and, 1616, 1620, resulting, in, an, increase, in, snowy, landscapes, depicted, in, chinese, paintings, in, addition, to, these, weather, patterns, china, also, faced, other, natural, disasters, during, this, time, period, in, 1586, extensive, flooding, occurred, while, locust, raids, destroyed, crops, in, 1587, 1609, and, 1615, 1619, following, periods, of, drought, deforestation, in, the, northwest, also, caused, sandstorms, which, covered, beijing, in, clouds, of, dust, in, 1618, and, 1619, the, most, significant, natural, disaster, during, the, wanli, era, was, the, earthquake, that, struck, china, in, december, 1604, its, epicenter, was, located, 30, km, off, the, coast, of, fujian, resulting, in, the, destruction, of, the, port, cities, of, quanzhou, and, zhangzhou, as, well, as, damage, to, buildings, in, moon, port, the, effects, of, the, earthquake, were, felt, as, far, as, shanghai, and, inland, areas, such, as, huguang, and, guangxi, the, worst, individual, disasters, were, the, floods, in, the, north, in, 1585, followed, by, a, major, epidemic, the, following, year, a, severe, drought, across, the, country, in, 1589, droughts, in, fujian, and, the, north, in, the, second, decade, of, the, 17th, century, and, finally, widespread, floods, in, 1613, overall, the, most, difficult, years, of, the, wanli, era, were, the, periods, 1586, 88, and, 1615, 17, the, drought, induced, famine, of, 1587, 88, was, the, first, major, famine, since, the, mid, 1540s, followed, by, an, epidemic, according, to, the, historian, of, demography, zhao, shuqi, half, of, the, people, in, northern, china, died, during, this, time, causing, the, population, of, shanxi, zhili, and, henan, provinces, to, decrease, from, 25, 6, million, in, 1580, to, 12, 8, million, in, 1588, the, yangtze, valley, was, also, affected, by, these, disasters, the, disasters, in, the, years, 1586, 88, shocked, the, government, however, the, reserves, accumulated, by, zhang, juzheng, helped, overcome, the, difficulties, the, authorities, learned, from, this, crisis, and, were, able, to, intervene, when, the, henan, famine, broke, out, six, years, later, preventing, it, from, spreading, the, second, series, of, natural, disasters, began, in, 1615, preceded, by, two, years, of, flooding, in, northern, china, this, combination, of, floods, and, drought, greatly, impacted, agriculture, leading, to, regions, across, the, country, requesting, assistance, starting, in, the, autumn, of, 1615, the, situation, was, particularly, dire, in, shandong, where, 900, 000, people, were, starving, and, the, civil, administration, was, beginning, to, fall, apart, due, to, food, shortages, the, famine, spread, from, northern, china, to, the, yangtze, river, basin, by, the, end, of, the, year, and, the, following, year, it, affected, guangdong, by, the, following, year, the, northwest, and, southwest, regions, of, the, ming, dynasty, were, also, affected, the, drought, and, floods, continued, until, 1620, in, response, to, the, famine, local, authorities, did, not, rely, on, state, reserve, granaries, which, had, mostly, disappeared, but, instead, called, on, the, wealthy, to, purchase, and, import, grain, officials, only, intervened, by, setting, maximum, prices, this, meant, that, the, state, did, not, have, to, maintain, a, stockpile, of, grain, when, it, could, be, purchased, on, the, market, however, even, in, fertile, years, regions, such, as, jiangnan, still, struggled, due, to, their, dependence, on, rice, imports, in, the, first, third, of, the, 16th, century, europeans, brought, new, agricultural, crops, to, china, including, maize, sweet, potatoes, and, groundnuts, these, crops, were, documented, to, have, been, cultivated, in, china, during, the, second, third, of, the, 16th, century, during, the, wanli, era, other, originally, american, species, such, as, tobacco, and, sweet, potatoes, were, introduced, and, spread, throughout, the, country, tobacco, was, commercially, grown, in, fujian, and, exported, to, the, philippines, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, cultivation, began, in, guangdong, initially, tobacco, was, popular, among, the, poor, in, jiangnan, but, eventually, became, a, habit, among, the, elite, by, the, beginning, of, the, qing, period, it, was, reported, that, every, official, soldier, and, eight, out, of, ten, peasants, in, the, region, smoked, it, was, not, until, the, 1630s, that, beijing, officials, began, to, mention, tobacco, sweet, potatoes, arrived, in, china, in, the, early, 1590s, possibly, even, earlier, they, were, brought, by, chinese, merchants, from, the, philippines, to, fujian, and, guangdong, and, may, have, also, been, imported, from, vietnam, after, a, famine, in, fujian, in, 1594, the, local, governor, encouraged, and, promoted, the, cultivation, of, sweet, potatoes, these, crops, quickly, took, hold, in, fujian, and, guangdong, and, later, spread, to, other, regions, of, china, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, during, the, wanli, era, there, was, a, significant, boom, in, industry, particularly, in, the, production, of, silk, cotton, and, porcelain, the, textile, industry, in, shaanxi, employed, a, large, number, of, people, while, guangdong, saw, the, emergence, of, large, ironworks, with, thousands, of, workers, this, period, also, saw, the, development, of, specialization, in, agricultural, production, and, a, significant, increase, in, interregional, trade, the, impact, of, this, development, was, most, strongly, felt, in, jiangnan, where, cities, such, as, suzhou, songjiang, jiaxing, and, nanjing, flourished, suzhou, known, for, its, silk, and, financial, industries, saw, its, population, grow, to, over, half, a, million, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, while, songjiang, became, a, center, for, cotton, cultivation, a, significant, portion, of, the, production, was, exported, in, exchange, for, silver, between, 1560, and, 1640, the, spanish, colonies, in, the, americas, shipped, 1, 000, tons, of, silver, across, the, pacific, with, 900, tons, ending, up, in, china, however, during, this, same, time, period, japan, sent, 6, 7, times, more, silver, to, china, this, influx, of, foreign, silver, coincided, with, the, commercialization, of, the, economy, which, led, to, growth, in, industries, such, as, cotton, and, silk, as, well, as, the, growth, of, cities, and, trade, however, this, commercialization, did, not, result, in, prosperity, for, all, land, and, rice, prices, remained, stagnant, and, even, fell, in, the, 1570s, and, 1580s, before, experiencing, a, sudden, increase, in, 1587, 89, due, to, famines, in, southern, china, additionally, wages, and, labor, productivity, in, the, jiangnan, cotton, industry, also, declined, contemporary, commentators, observed, that, while, the, market, economy, was, thriving, state, finances, remained, poor, despite, the, luxurious, lifestyle, of, urban, elites, the, majority, of, peasants, and, day, laborers, continued, to, live, in, poverty, these, economic, changes, also, brought, about, changes, in, values, particularly, in, regards, to, official, confucian, doctrines, during, the, 16th, century, the, ming, state, gradually, shifted, towards, the, policy, of, zhaoshang, maiban, the, government, purchase, from, private, merchants, for, example, during, the, jiajing, era, the, government, began, purchasing, clothes, for, silver, instead, of, relying, on, state, textile, factories, in, suzhou, and, hangzhou, which, had, since, disappeared, and, been, replaced, by, private, factories, this, marked, the, emergence, of, a, market, economy, where, traders, were, no, longer, mere, extensions, of, the, state, apparatus, and, were, able, to, negotiate, prices, and, contract, volumes, state, contracts, also, encouraged, the, growth, of, private, enterprises, while, the, quality, of, production, in, state, factories, declined, for, instance, in, 1575, the, army, had, to, return, 5, 000, unusable, shields, by, the, late, 16th, century, army, officers, were, refusing, to, use, goods, produced, by, state, workshops, and, instead, demanded, silver, from, the, government, to, purchase, equipment, on, the, market, the, government, obtained, the, necessary, silver, by, converting, compulsory, services, into, payments, in, the, single, bar, reform, the, aim, of, the, reform, was, to, eliminate, levies, in, kind, services, and, compulsory, work, in, the, lijia, system, and, replace, them, with, a, surcharge, to, the, land, tax, paid, in, silver, transfers, of, various, duties, to, silver, payments, had, been, taking, place, in, various, counties, since, the, 1520s, with, the, most, intense, changes, occurring, in, the, 1570s, to, the, 1590s, the, reform, was, implemented, by, county, authorities, throughout, the, country, the, changes, proceeded, from, the, more, developed, south, of, the, country, to, the, north, where, the, introduction, of, procedures, common, in, the, south, caused, a, wave, of, resistance, controversy, centered, primarily, on, the, repeal, of, progressive, household, taxation, advocates, of, the, reform, argued, that, wealthy, households, usually, received, tax, exemptions, making, progressive, taxation, only, fictitious, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, land, tax, surcharges, had, already, replaced, almost, all, benefits, and, labor, performed, in, the, lijia, system, in, an, effort, to, streamline, the, collection, of, land, tax, in, 1581, senior, grand, secretary, zhang, juzheng, advocated, for, the, creation, of, a, new, cadastre, over, the, course, of, 1581, 1582, fields, were, measured, boundaries, were, marked, sizes, were, calculated, and, owners, and, tenants, were, recorded, cadastral, maps, were, also, compiled, during, this, time, unfortunately, due, to, zhang, s, untimely, death, there, was, no, final, summary, of, data, for, the, entire, country, however, at, the, local, level, the, work, served, its, purpose, zhang, s, cadastre, served, as, the, foundation, for, later, ming, and, qing, cadastres, as, early, as, 1581, the, ministry, of, revennue, had, compiled, the, wanli, kuai, ji, lu, record, of, the, accounting, procedures, of, the, wanli, reign, which, provided, an, overview, of, taxes, and, fees, throughout, the, empire, this, document, highlighted, the, complexity, diversity, and, dependence, on, local, conditions, of, these, taxes, making, unification, a, challenging, task, after, incorporating, some, compulsory, works, the, land, tax, amounted, to, 5, 10, of, the, harvest, but, in, the, four, most, heavily, taxed, prefectures, of, nanzhili, it, reached, 14, 20, in, the, 1570s, 1590s, approximately, 21, million, liang, s, of, silver, were, collected, for, the, land, tax, mostly, in, the, form, of, grain, outside, of, jiangnan, in, most, counties, of, ming, china, few, products, were, traded, across, borders, with, the, most, important, being, grain, grain, was, primarily, imported, to, jiangnan, from, jiangxi, huguang, and, western, nanzhili, while, north, zhili, imported, rice, from, shandong, and, beijing, imported, tax, rice, the, majority, of, rice, on, the, market, was, collected, by, landlords, from, their, tenants, as, rent, however, the, grain, market, also, facilitated, the, production, of, non, food, goods, particularly, textiles, in, jiangnan, there, were, areas, that, did, not, grow, rice, but, instead, focused, on, textile, crops, such, as, cotton, and, mulberry, mulberries, were, primarily, grown, in, northern, zhejiang, with, huzhou, being, a, central, location, in, and, around, songjiang, cotton, was, grown, on, more, than, half, of, the, land, the, focus, was, not, just, on, growing, and, producing, goods, but, also, on, selling, them, in, the, late, ming, period, the, economy, in, jiangnan, shifted, from, cultivation, to, the, processing, of, cotton, which, was, imported, from, shandong, henan, fujian, and, guangdong, suzhou, and, hangzhou, were, known, as, centers, for, the, production, of, luxury, goods, while, ordinary, fabrics, were, produced, in, the, surrounding, areas, within, the, production, process, there, was, specialization, in, individual, stages, such, as, spinning, and, weaving, of, the, various, regional, merchant, groups, those, from, shanxi, dominated, the, salt, trade, in, the, interior, including, sichuan, meanwhile, merchants, from, huizhou, controlled, long, distance, trade, on, the, grand, canal, and, were, the, most, influential, wholesalers, and, retailers, in, jiangnan, they, were, followed, by, merchants, from, suzhou, fujian, and, guangzhou, in, that, order, merchants, from, jiangxi, operated, on, a, smaller, scale, mainly, in, henan, huguang, and, sichuan, local, agents, offered, boats, crew, and, porters, for, hire, on, trade, routes, travel, guides, were, published, providing, information, on, routes, distances, inns, famous, places, ferries, and, safety, commercial, intermediaries, allowed, for, the, sending, of, money, through, drafts, women, entrepreneurs, emerged, selling, various, goods, and, also, acted, as, intermediaries, in, legal, disputes, conservatives, viewed, women, s, involvement, in, trade, with, disdain, as, seen, in, the, case, of, li, ze, who, praised, a, prefect, for, banning, gambling, and, women, from, selling, at, markets, in, the, jiaxing, prefecture, the, growth, of, silver, imports, in, the, first, third, of, the, 16th, century, led, to, an, increase, in, its, use, by, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, ming, statesmen, were, already, concerned, that, silver, would, completely, replace, bronze, coins, in, the, last, third, of, the, 16th, century, the, issue, of, the, relationship, between, silver, and, coins, became, a, central, topic, in, discussions, about, monetary, policy, some, officials, suggested, halting, the, production, of, coins, due, to, their, lack, of, profitability, while, their, opponents, argued, that, this, was, a, short, sighted, policy, that, ignored, the, long, term, benefits, of, increasing, circulation, this, allowed, silver, to, become, the, dominant, currency, in, the, 1570s, and, 1580s, debates, about, currency, were, dominated, by, concerns, about, silver, shortages, causing, deflation, but, these, debates, died, down, in, the, 1590s, the, import, of, silver, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, ming, economy, its, price, relative, to, gold, and, copper, fell, by, half, during, the, wan, li, era, but, its, purchasing, power, was, still, greater, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, world, the, ministry, of, revennue, s, silver, income, doubled, during, the, 1570s, alone, from, about, 90, tons, to, approximately, 165, tons, per, year, the, income, of, local, authorities, also, increased, such, as, in, the, moon, port, the, main, center, of, foreign, maritime, trade, where, trade, licenses, and, customs, fees, grew, from, 113, kg, of, silver, to, over, one, ton, between, 1570, and, 1594, however, the, influx, of, silver, also, led, to, the, export, of, gold, and, coins, this, influx, of, silver, also, had, negative, effects, as, inflation, appeared, in, regions, with, a, surplus, of, silver, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, such, as, the, southeast, coast, jiangnan, and, the, grand, canal, silver, was, distrusted, by, many, officials, because, they, feared, dependence, on, its, inflow, from, abroad, and, did, not, trust, its, ability, to, provide, all, the, functions, of, money, as, a, result, they, attempted, to, revive, the, use, of, coins, in, 1571, 1572, the, mints, were, briefly, opened, but, zhang, juzheng, reopened, them, in, 1576, he, restored, the, mints, in, beijing, and, nanjing, and, later, in, yunnan, additionally, he, opened, mints, in, both, the, northern, provinces, where, coins, were, commonly, used, shanxi, shandong, and, henan, as, well, as, in, provinces, where, they, were, not, commonly, used, shaanxi, jiangxi, fujian, and, huguang, while, the, mints, in, the, metropolitan, areas, were, state, owned, those, in, the, provinces, were, run, by, licensed, entrepreneurs, however, the, production, of, coins, faced, immediate, challenges, such, as, a, shortage, of, copper, and, difficulties, in, hiring, qualified, personnel, in, jiangxi, for, example, the, mint, was, only, able, to, produce, 5, of, the, planned, amount, of, coins, in, response, the, authorities, decreed, that, at, least, 70, of, tax, payments, must, be, made, in, new, coins, and, encouraged, merchants, to, import, coins, from, surrounding, provinces, however, merchants, often, supplied, low, quality, privately, produced, coins, which, were, illegal, similarly, the, introduction, of, coins, failed, in, fujian, where, silver, was, already, widely, used, zhang, s, monetary, policy, was, fragmented, with, each, province, s, officials, making, their, own, decisions, on, supporting, coinage, this, led, to, various, issues, such, as, a, revolt, in, hangzhou, in, 1582, when, soldiers, salaries, were, converted, into, coins, in, zhejiang, and, the, banning, of, private, exchange, offices, in, jiangxi, which, hindered, the, circulation, of, new, coins, some, provinces, also, prohibited, the, export, of, coins, from, their, territory, while, others, prohibited, coins, cast, outside, their, territory, attempts, to, introduce, new, coins, into, circulation, by, selling, them, at, a, discount, only, benefited, money, changers, who, bought, cheap, coins, from, the, authorities, and, resold, them, at, the, normal, market, price, in, some, cases, attempts, to, ban, the, use, of, illegal, private, coins, resulted, in, violent, protests, and, the, lifting, of, the, bans, while, coins, cast, in, beijing, were, accepted, by, the, market, low, quality, private, coins, continued, to, dominate, in, the, south, in, 1579, zhang, admitted, that, the, attempt, to, introduce, coins, had, failed, he, closed, the, yunnan, mint, the, following, year, and, most, of, the, other, provincial, mints, in, 1582, however, three, mints, in, huguang, continued, to, operate, casting, different, coins, and, leading, to, the, division, of, the, province, into, several, mint, zones, after, zhang, s, death, his, successors, and, opponents, closed, most, of, the, mints, due, to, inefficiency, zhang, s, opponents, argued, that, the, state, should, not, interfere, in, market, and, currency, affairs, and, impose, a, currency, that, the, people, did, not, want, on, the, other, hand, some, argued, that, while, silver, served, as, a, capital, and, store, of, value, coins, were, essential, as, a, medium, of, exchange, and, their, production, even, if, unprofitable, would, lead, to, economic, recovery, in, the, long, run, in, 1599, the, wanli, emperor, returned, to, an, expansive, monetary, policy, the, production, of, new, coins, was, concentrated, in, nanjing, where, the, capacity, of, mints, increased, tenfold, however, the, circulation, of, these, coins, was, limited, to, the, immediate, vicinity, of, nanjing, as, a, result, there, was, a, surplus, of, coins, in, the, city, causing, their, value, to, decrease, from, 850, to, 1300, per, liang, of, silver, however, in, 1606, floods, disrupted, the, import, of, metals, causing, the, price, of, copper, to, rise, in, response, the, state, limited, coin, production, and, laid, off, 3, 000, workers, from, the, mints, these, workers, then, used, their, knowledge, to, produce, illegal, coins, as, a, result, private, coins, began, to, replace, national, coins, within, a, few, years, the, government, responded, by, banning, the, use, of, private, coins, but, this, caused, money, changers, to, stop, accepting, any, coins, as, a, precaution, nanjing, merchants, followed, suit, leading, to, riots, among, the, people, this, was, especially, problematic, for, day, laborers, and, workers, who, were, paid, in, coins, and, relied, on, merchants, accepting, them, for, their, daily, needs, the, use, of, less, valuable, private, coins, became, more, beneficial, for, their, day, to, day, transactions, wang, yangming, rejected, the, idea, of, confucianism, as, a, fixed, belief, stating, that, the, way, is, not, the, private, property, of, confucius, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, self, awareness, and, self, knowledge, over, strict, adherence, to, doctrine, in, general, he, shifted, the, focus, of, confucianism, from, following, the, teachings, of, past, sages, to, following, one, s, own, heart, however, in, the, 1570s, zhang, juzheng, emerged, as, a, strong, opponent, of, wang, s, followers, offering, an, alternative, perspective, zhang, emphasized, the, pragmatic, pursuit, of, state, interests, in, contrast, to, the, emphasis, on, personal, improvement, within, wang, s, teachings, he, believed, that, actions, that, benefited, the, state, and, its, people, were, the, correct, ones, stating, if, it, is, to, the, benefit, of, the, state, i, would, do, it, regardless, of, life, or, death, zhang, justified, his, actions, against, those, who, were, preoccupied, with, moral, debates, and, self, reflection, viewing, them, as, irresponsible, and, unproductive, he, did, not, see, them, as, moral, role, models, but, rather, as, lazy, individuals, after, the, death, of, zhang, juzheng, in, 1584, three, ming, philosophers, hu, juren, chen, xianzhang, and, wang, yangming, were, given, exceptional, official, recognition, they, were, among, the, supporters, of, private, confucian, academies, whose, tablets, were, placed, in, the, temple, of, confucius, wang, yangming, s, followers, particularly, wang, gen, and, his, students, known, as, the, taizhou, school, were, the, most, radical, in, their, rejection, of, zhuist, orthodoxy, in, the, late, 16th, century, li, zhi, accused, the, conformists, in, authority, of, hypocrisy, prioritizing, their, own, benefit, and, career, over, correctness, he, also, questioned, the, infallibility, of, the, classics, and, defended, the, legitimacy, of, human, desires, li, zhi, believed, that, pursuing, self, interest, was, good, as, it, motivated, peasants, artisans, and, scholars, to, perform, their, professions, to, the, best, of, their, abilities, this, led, to, the, spread, of, values, such, as, materialism, pragmatism, and, utilitarianism, and, the, judging, of, people, not, by, their, occupation, but, by, their, wealth, as, a, result, the, social, status, of, poor, scholars, was, no, longer, higher, than, that, of, rich, merchants, the, enthusiasm, for, wang, yangming, s, subjectivism, reached, its, peak, at, the, turn, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, when, individual, experience, was, valued, above, traditional, patterns, these, attitudes, later, influenced, the, criticality, and, empiricism, of, the, qing, confucians, in, the, late, 16th, century, there, was, a, growing, trend, towards, syncretism, which, seemed, to, stem, from, a, dissatisfaction, with, traditional, confucian, beliefs, lin, zhao, en, known, as, the, master, of, the, three, teachings, sought, to, connect, confucianism, with, buddhism, and, taoism, particularly, in, regards, to, taoist, healing, practices, along, with, his, studies, in, confucianism, hu, zhi, also, delved, into, buddhism, and, taoism, practicing, meditation, and, ultimately, achieving, enlightenment, from, a, buddhist, perspective, this, was, seen, as, a, revelation, of, buddha, nature, while, confucians, viewed, it, as, a, discovery, of, the, heart, mind, through, innate, knowledge, in, 1603, gu, xiancheng, upon, the, suggestion, of, his, friend, gao, panlong, revived, the, donglin, academy, as, a, hub, for, discussions, on, confucianism, this, initiative, attracted, hundreds, of, educated, individuals, who, engaged, in, regular, debates, quickly, establishing, the, academy, as, a, prominent, intellectual, center, on, a, national, level, the, donglins, rejected, the, buddhist, and, taoist, practice, of, seclusion, instead, advocating, for, active, participation, in, public, life, the, academy, s, leaders, aimed, for, a, moral, revival, to, improve, the, political, climate, of, the, country, they, opposed, the, devotion, to, intuition, promoted, by, wang, s, follower, wang, ji, and, the, taizhou, school, instead, emphasizing, disciplined, effort, and, action, following, zhu, xi, s, model, they, divided, their, studies, between, reading, books, and, meditation, which, they, did, not, associate, with, chan, buddhist, but, rather, derived, from, confucian, ritualism, in, his, theoretical, works, dong, qichang, 1555, 1636, from, songjiang, a, renowned, scholar, who, excelled, in, literary, composition, painting, and, calligraphy, from, a, young, age, best, expressed, the, aesthetic, rules, of, the, imperial, painting, academy, while, he, was, primarily, known, as, a, theoretician, of, painting, he, also, wrote, about, the, history, of, calligraphy, dong, emphasized, the, importance, of, painting, as, a, form, of, calligraphic, expression, and, encouraged, artists, to, study, the, techniques, of, past, masters, in, order, to, validate, his, own, artistic, abilities, he, argued, that, throughout, history, painters, were, divided, into, two, distinct, schools, the, ink, painting, of, the, southern, school, which, strove, to, express, the, inner, essence, of, the, subject, and, the, descriptive, decorative, tradition, of, professional, craftsman, painters, of, the, northern, school, he, himself, positioned, himself, at, the, end, of, the, development, of, the, southern, school, as, the, true, heir, of, literati, painting, seeking, to, express, the, thoughts, of, the, creator, rather, than, seeking, material, gain, his, monumental, ink, landscapes, became, the, standard, for, traditional, painting, and, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, the, concept, of, the, northern, and, southern, schools, was, reevaluated, one, of, the, notable, painters, of, the, wanli, era, was, wu, bin, who, worked, in, nanjing, and, later, at, the, beijing, court, he, was, known, for, his, eccentric, style, influenced, by, the, local, fujian, tradition, and, elements, of, the, wu, school, which, gave, his, paintings, a, sense, of, elegance, and, beauty, however, he, also, incorporated, expressive, techniques, from, the, zhe, school, dong, qichang, was, a, dominant, figure, in, the, theory, and, practice, of, late, ming, calligraphy, in, his, works, on, calligraphy, he, placed, the, masters, of, his, songjiang, region, above, those, of, suzhou, he, stressed, the, importance, of, studying, calligraphy, from, the, eastern, jin, 4th, century, and, tang, 7th, 9th, century, periods, specifically, highlighting, the, works, of, wang, xizhi, and, wang, xianzhi, however, he, did, not, advocate, for, direct, imitation, of, their, styles, but, rather, a, thorough, analysis, of, their, techniques, other, notable, calligraphers, from, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, in, songjiang, included, dong, qichang, s, friend, chen, jiru, a, versatile, artist, and, collector, and, xu, wei, a, predecessor, of, individual, qing, dynasty, artists, known, for, his, flowers, and, birds, genre, paintings, and, his, crazy, conceptual, calligraphy, style, which, was, similar, to, abstract, painting, in, the, 1570s, and, 1580s, wang, shizhen, held, the, esteemed, position, of, literary, arbiter, and, most, respected, critic, of, ming, china, he, was, a, versatile, artist, and, the, leading, figure, among, the, later, seven, masters, of, the, ming, in, the, following, generation, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, poets, focused, on, expressing, their, own, nature, individual, creativity, and, emotions, their, thinking, was, influenced, by, the, individualistic, philosophy, of, li, zhi, prominent, figures, of, this, era, included, tang, xianzu, a, poet, essayist, calligrapher, dramatist, and, literary, theorist, xu, wei, a, poet, essayist, calligrapher, painter, and, dramatist, and, tu, long, a, poet, critic, dramatist, art, collector, and, connoisseur, one, of, the, most, notable, poets, of, the, wanli, era, was, hu, yinglin, who, came, from, a, wealthy, family, but, chose, to, pursue, literature, instead, of, a, career, in, the, civil, service, after, failing, the, examinations, although, his, poems, were, not, particularly, significant, he, compiled, an, encyclopedia, of, poetics, called, shisou, thickets, of, criticism, in, this, work, he, provided, a, structured, overview, of, poetic, forms, history, and, sources, from, the, perspective, of, the, archaizing, movement, this, movement, viewed, tang, poetry, as, the, pinnacle, of, poetic, achievement, but, also, recognized, its, revival, during, the, yuan, period, and, the, contributions, of, the, seven, earlier, and, seven, later, masters, in, the, 16th, century, the, poets, of, the, gong, an, school, particularly, the, yuan, brothers, yuan, hongdao, yuan, zongdao, and, yuan, zhongdao, held, distinct, positions, li, zhi, had, a, direct, influence, on, the, yuan, brothers, and, their, gong, an, school, shaping, their, rejection, of, traditional, authorities, avoidance, of, imitation, which, they, believed, stifled, creativity, pursuit, of, natural, expression, and, advocacy, for, drama, and, fiction, as, legitimate, literary, forms, however, the, poetry, of, the, three, brothers, was, largely, conventional, they, differed, from, previous, generations, earlier, seven, masters, and, later, seven, masters, of, the, ming, by, imitating, middle, tang, especially, bai, juyi, and, song, su, shi, poetry, rather, than, the, pinnacle, of, tang, poetry, in, this, they, followed, wang, shizhen, who, also, looked, to, middle, tang, and, song, poets, as, role, models, more, than, their, poetry, the, brothers, criticism, was, widely, read, and, their, conclusions, had, gained, general, recognition, by, the, mid, 17th, century, the, brothers, were, also, active, in, literary, associations, blending, confucianism, with, buddhism, and, taoism, and, exploring, various, prose, and, encyclopedic, disciplines, such, as, floristry, and, pharmacopoeia, yuan, hongdao, was, a, proponent, of, literature, written, in, colloquial, language, arguing, that, it, too, was, capable, of,

that, poetry, should, express, natural, feelings, they, criticized, the, imitation, of, bai, juyi, and, su, shi, as, producing, vulgar, and, crude, poetry, instead, they, focused, on, cultivating, their, own, style, striving, to, capture, the, depth, and, scale, of, their, favorite, pre, tang, and, tang, works, but, often, falling, into, the, trap, of, imitation, their, most, notable,

their, views, on, poetic, creation, the, success, of, these, anthologies, was, further, enhanced, by, the, contributions, of, min, qiji, who, distinguished, the, poems, in, color, from, the, editors,

was, rare, at, the, time, began, to, flourish, two, notable, novels, from, the, wanli, era, were, journey, to, the, west, one, of, the, four, classic, chinese, novels, and, the, socio, critical, jin,

size, of, zheng, he, s, treasure, ships, the, development, of, drama, was, greatly, influenced, by, liang, chenyu, who, incorporated, the, kunshan, style, of, music, known, as, kunqu, into, his, drama, washing, silken, gauze, huan, sha, ji, this, combination, of, kunqu, music, and, chuanqi, dramatic, form, was, a, huge, success, leading, to, the, merging, of, the, two, concepts, as, a, result, in, the, following, decades, numerous, authors, and, plays, emerged, the, most, prestigious, position, in, the, theater, world, was, held, by, private, theater, troupes, who, were, employed, by, the, wealthy, for, their, own, entertainment, and, that, of, their, guests, among, the, playwrights, tang, xianzu, was, particularly, notable, for, his, four, dream, plays, with, his, work, the, peony, pavilion, being, highly, regarded, another, important, playwright, of, the, wanli, era, was, zheng, zhizhen, who, adapted, the, popular, story, mulian, rescues, his, mother, mulian, jiu, mu,

source, of, yuan, zaju, dramas, for, four, centuries, however, the, plays, in, it, do, not, have, an, original, form, but, were, significantly, modified, by, zang, in, accordance, with, late, ming, values, and, artistic, attitudes, in, the, early, 16th, century, printed, literature, prevailed, over, manuscript, literature, leading, to, an, explosive, expansion, of, written, texts, compared, to, europe, paper, was, cheap, in, china, and, woodblock, printing, did, not, require, a, large, initial, investment, allowing, for, the, rapid, spread, of, printed, literature, of, various, kinds, and, genres, this, abundance, of, books, was, noted, by, europeans, such, as, matteo, ricci, during, the, wanli, era, who, marveled, at, the, wealth, of, literary, resources, in, china, while, books, were, generally, affordable, rare, prints, could, still, be, quite, expensive, costing, up, to, a, hundred, liang, s, of, silver, the, widespread, availability, of, books, also, led, to, an, increase, in, leisure, reading, as, people, were, not, only, reading, for, work, but, also, for, pleasure, according, to, european, visitors, literacy, was, widespread, in, china, with, even, the, poorest, families, having, access, to, education, and, the, ability, to, read, and, write, this, resulted, in, a, larger, number, of, people, reading, books, in, china, and, around, the, world, than, ever, before, the, book, market, grew, exponentially, in, the, first, third, of, the, 16th, century, the, market, was, relatively, limited, and, focused, mainly, on, confucian, classics, official, histories, and, neo, confucian, philosophers, these, books, were, printed, in, princely, palaces, offices, and, commercially, with, a, particular, concentration, in, fujian, specifically, in, jianning, prefecture, in, the, northern, part, of, the, province, however, in, the, wanli, era, commercial, publishers, began, printing, a, wide, range, of, literature, in, hopes, of, making, a, profit, this, included, not, only, the, aforementioned, official, literature, but, also, various, genres, of, fiction, encyclopedias, and, manuals, of, all, kinds, these, ranged, from, pocket, classics, for, students, to, guides, on, how, to, become, a, writer, or, lead, the, country, the, market, was, also, flooded, with, manuals, and, encyclopedias, on, household, management, by, the, end, of, the, century, fiction, had, become, extremely, popular, the, affordability, of, printing, allowed, for, the, distribution, of, specialized, books, such, as, medical, texts, which, had, previously, only, been, available, in, manuscript, form, the, most, significant, regions, for, book, production, were, suzhou, fujian, and, zhejiang, suzhou, was, known, for, printing, the, highest, quality, and, most, expensive, books, while, fujian, produced, the, largest, quantity, at, the, lowest, cost, zhejiang, ranked, second, in, both, aspects, the, growth, and, commercialization, of, the, book, market, encouraged, academics, to, publish, their, own, work, a, departure, from, the, previous, practice, of, having, their, students, or, descendants, publish, for, them, esteemed, scholars, could, rely, on, publishers, to, pay, them, in, advance, for, their, writing, with, the, expectation, of, making, a, profit, this, led, to, the, emergence, of, scholars, who, focused, solely, on, writing, and, publishing, private, libraries, were, growing, in, size, during, the, song, dynasty, it, was, rare, for, someone, to, have, a, library, with, ten, thousand, juan, however, during, the, wanli, era, private, libraries, in, jiangnan, had, 30, 000, to, 50, 000, juan, some, scholars, like, ke, jian, from, yangzhou, even, had, 10, 000, titles, in, their, personal, collections, with, each, title, possibly, costing, several, tens, of, juan, there, were, dozens, of, these, extensive, private, libraries, in, existence, due, to, their, size, many, of, these, large, private, libraries, were, housed, in, separate, buildings, for, example, the, famous, bibliophile, mao, kun, s, library, had, twelve, rooms, these, impressive, private, libraries, were, a, source, of, amazement, for, europeans, private, newspapers, also, began, to, emerge, during, this, time, initially, they, mainly, republished, material, from, the, official, gazette, but, eventually, they, started, to, produce, their, own, news, as, early, as, the, 1590s, former, minister, yu, shenxing, expressed, concern, that, newspaper, publishers, were, exaggerating, the, failures, of, the, fighting, on, the, northern, border, causing, unnecessary, panic, among, the, population, he, criticized, their, focus, on, sensational, news, for, the, sake, of, marketability, and, profit, rather, than, reporting, on, truly, important, events, only, individuals, with, official, status, were, able, to, ensure, the, preservation, of, a, merchant, family, s, wealth, as, a, result, merchants, often, encouraged, their, sons, to, pursue, education, and, obtain, an, official, rank, however, during, the, first, two, centuries, of, the, ming, dynasty, only, candidates, from, families, of, officials, peasants, or, landowners, craftsmen, and, soldiers, were, allowed, to, take, the, civil, service, examinations, merchants, were, not, permitted, to, participate, in, the, wanli, era, merchants, were, finally, allowed, to, participate, in, the, imperial, examinations, however, only, one, candidate, a, certain, zheng, maohua, in, 1607, was, able, to, pass, the, highest, level, of, the, exams, known, as, the, palace, exams, and, obtain, the, jinshi, rank, despite, this, merchants, still, managed, to, pass, the, exams, by, registering, under, the, names, of, others, or, posing, as, peasants, or, soldiers, from, a, different, location, as, a, result, in, the, late, ming, period, the, majority, of, successful, exam, candidates, came, from, merchant, families, in, the, students, environment, the, eight, legged, essay, was, an, important, genre, and, mastery, of, it, was, crucial, for, success, in, exams, this, literary, form, emerged, in, the, wanli, era, and, gained, popularity, over, the, course, of, a, century, it, was, not, yet, rigid, and, was, seen, as, a, challenge, for, intellectuals, to, showcase, their, stylistic, dexterity, esteemed, art, critics, like, li, zhi, and, yuan, hongdao, valued, this, genre, for, its, experimental, and, innovative, nature, however, mastering, the, eight, legged, essay, required, more, than, just, individual, study, the, preferences, and, styles, favored, by, examiners, were, constantly, changing, giving, an, advantage, to, candidates, from, larger, cities, who, could, keep, up, with, these, trends, this, is, why, it, was, beneficial, to, be, part, of, literary, societies, in, the, 1570s, these, societies, began, publishing, successful, essays, with, commentary, and, criticism, additionally, collections, of, model, essays, were, published, by, the, authorities, starting, in, 1587, the, study, was, costly, for, example, wang, shizhen, spent, 300, liang, 11, 2, kg, of, silver, per, year, on, his, studies, even, the, poorest, candidates, had, to, cover, at, least, a, third, of, the, cost, often, resulting, in, debt, after, being, appointed, to, office, officials, had, to, use, their, salaries, to, pay, off, creditors, who, were, often, wealthy, merchants, however, official, salaries, were, not, high, with, county, heads, only, earning, 87, liang, per, year, in, the, 16th, century, as, a, result, most, officials, relied, on, the, revenues, from, their, office, and, any, significant, increase, in, wealth, was, considered, corrupt, in, 1583, the, government, tightened, control, over, provincial, examinations, by, selecting, chief, examiners, and, their, deputies, from, members, of, the, hanlin, academy, previously, these, positions, were, held, by, teachers, in, charge, of, county, and, prefectural, state, schools, who, typically, only, passed, the, provincial, exams, in, the, early, ming, period, the, style, materials, and, color, of, clothing, were, determined, by, the, state, as, early, as, 1541, the, ministry, of, rites, prohibited, inappropriate, styles, of, dress, however, by, the, 1560s, these, prohibitions, were, no, longer, being, enforced, and, people, began, to, dress, according, to, ever, changing, fashion, trends, the, city, of, suzhou, became, the, center, of, fashion, and, set, the, trends, for, the, rest, of, the, country, this, distinction, between, appropriate, and, inappropriate, extended, beyond, clothing, to, items, of, daily, use, and, household, equipment, the, arbiters, of, taste, and, elegance, condemned, the, ostentatious, display, of, wealth, such, as, the, use, of, gold, utensils, and, dishes, as, vulgar, behavior, of, the, uneducated, wealthy, this, behavior, was, becoming, more, common, due, to, the, influx, of, silver, from, abroad, which, led, to, the, enrichment, of, merchants, who, surpassed, landowners, in, terms, of, wealth, and, extravagant, spending, these, nouveau, riche, individuals, sought, social, recognition, but, the, traditional, elites, fought, back, and, tried, to, maintain, their, upper, hand, one, of, their, tactics, was, the, institution, of, fashion, in, the, last, decade, of, the, wanli, era, the, fear, of, the, wealth, and, influence, of, the, nouveau, riche, reached, its, peak, on, the, other, hand, from, the, 1590s, onwards, writers, from, the, gentry, class, produced, manuals, instructing, the, ignorant, on, what, objects, and, antiques, were, appropriate, to, own, and, how, to, properly, dispose, of, them, in, accordance, with, cultural, norms, however, the, counterfeiting, of, antiquities, and, valuables, also, became, widespread, fashion, was, intertwined, with, geji, cultures, as, educated, and, cultured, g, j, s, like, xue, susu, and, ma, shouzhen, emerged, breaking, free, from, the, traditional, role, of, women, being, limited, to, the, household, fashion, was, also, intertwined, with, sexual, relations, a, trend, for, sexual, relations, with, boys, also, emerged, among, the, elite, openly, defying, confucian, norms, the, largest, military, campaigns, of, the, wanli, era, were, known, as, the, three, great, campaigns, of, the, wanli, era, the, first, of, these, was, the, suppression, of, the, rebellion, in, ningxia, followed, by, the, imjin, war, with, japan, in, korea, and, the, suppression, of, yang, yinglong, s, rebellion, in, bozhou, these, campaigns, involved, the, mobilization, of, tens, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, troops, as, well, as, their, movement, and, long, distance, supply, the, success, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, these, campaigns, can, be, attributed, to, the, overall, increase, in, china, s, military, power, during, the, 1570s, to, the, first, decade, of, the, seventeenth, century, during, this, time, the, ming, dynasty, was, aggressively, expanding, along, all, frontiers, including, launching, raids, into, the, mongolian, steppes, and, supporting, the, colonization, of, han, borderlands, in, addition, to, these, three, major, campaigns, the, ming, troops, also, suppressed, several, rebellions, within, the, empire, and, successfully, expanded, and, secured, the, borders, in, the, southwest, through, battles, with, the, burmese, this, allowed, for, the, colonization, of, previously, indigenous, territories, in, the, southwest, and, northwest, the, ming, dynasty, also, actively, interfered, in, the, affairs, of, the, jurchens, in, the, northeast, following, the, example, of, his, teacher, zhang, juzheng, the, wanli, emperor, placed, great, emphasis, on, military, affairs, this, was, one, of, the, few, areas, where, most, civil, officials, felt, insecure, giving, the, emperor, the, ability, to, enforce, his, will, in, order, to, bypass, the, usual, bureaucratic, procedures, wanli, relied, on, successful, generals, in, the, emperor, s, eyes, generals, were, more, dependable, and, trustworthy, than, officials, as, they, spent, most, of, their, time, in, the, field, and, did, not, have, the, opportunity, to, build, networks, of, support, in, the, capital, additionally, the, wanli, emperor, saw, generals, as, representatives, of, a, different, lifestyle, one, that, was, more, free, and, unartistic, he, took, great, care, in, selecting, capable, generals, and, was, not, afraid, to, give, them, extraordinary, powers, allowing, them, to, make, quick, decisions, without, waiting, for, his, approval, this, contributed, greatly, to, the, success, of, their, campaigns, the, wanli, emperor, was, also, willing, to, allocate, significant, funds, from, his, reserves, to, supply, and, equip, the, troops, and, he, entrusted, the, generals, with, powers, and, responsibilities, that, were, typically, reserved, for, civil, officials, despite, objections, from, the, government, on, the, northern, border, the, wanli, emperor, aimed, to, replace, static, defense, with, more, aggressive, tactics, in, his, own, words, we, still, shouldn, t, try, to, appease, the, nomads, they, could, be, very, ambitious, and, arrogant, there, is, no, way, to, satisfy, their, appetite, it, is, still, essential, to, build, up, our, own, strength, so, that, the, borderland, is, alertly, safeguarded, he, generally, preferred, a, decisive, rather, than, aggressive, approach, towards, domestic, rebels, and, foreign, enemies, under, the, leadership, of, capable, generals, the, ming, army, was, the, strongest, it, had, been, since, the, reign, of, the, yongle, emperor, 1402, 1424, contemporary, estimates, put, the, number, of, ming, soldiers, in, the, 1570s, at, 845, 000, by, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, ming, dynasty, had, over, 4, million, men, in, arms, training, centers, were, established, near, beijing, where, units, preparing, for, korea, also, trained, instead, of, relying, on, the, inefficient, and, incompetent, hereditary, soldiers, of, the, weisuo, system, the, ming, government, turned, to, hiring, mercenaries, who, were, better, trained, more, disciplined, and, more, cost, effective, in, battle, troops, from, militant, minority, nations, were, also, utilized, particularly, wolf, troops, lang, bing, from, guangxi, the, development, of, the, military, was, supported, by, a, number, of, manuals, and, handbooks, the, most, extensive, surviving, works, on, military, affairs, are, the, chouhai, tubian, gazeteer, of, coastal, defense, by, zheng, ruozeng, in, 1562, the, shenqi, pu, treatise, on, firearms, by, zhao, shizhen, in, 1598, and, the, wubei, zhi, encyclopedia, of, military, preparedness, by, mao, yuanyi, in, 1601, in, his, manuals, jixiao, xinshu,

of, units, and, outlined, the, use, of, weapons, and, procedures, based, on, terrain, and, soldier, experience, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, morale, and, training, for, soldiers, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, the, emperor, closely, monitored, military, threats, on, the, borders, in, 1619, shortly, before, his, death, he, allocated, funds, for, an, expedition, against, the, jurchens, in, liaodong, however, the, campaign, ended, in, a, disastrous, defeat, for, the, ming, army, the, emperor, then, protected, the, surviving, generals, including, li, rubai, from, government, attempts,

silver, which, they, imported, to, china, across, the, pacific, in, considerable, quantities, estimated, to, be, between, 50, and, 350, tons, per, year, this, trade, between, the, spanish,

10, 000, in, 1588, and, 30, 000, in, 1603, however, the, spanish, authorities, viewed, the, chinese, with, suspicion, and, concern, this, mutual, distrust, often, resulted, in, armed, clashes, and, in, 1603, a, pogrom, occurred, in, which, 20, according, to, chinese, sources, or, 15, according, to, spanish, sources, thousand, chinese, lost, their, lives, during, the, 1540s, american, silver, was, also, introduced, to, china, through, the, extensive, portuguese, trade, lisbon, elites, were, known, to, wear, chinese, silks, drink, chinese, tea, and, order, porcelain, with, european, motifs, from, china, the, portuguese, had, settled, in, macau, with, the, consent, of, local, authorities, as, early, as, the, 1550s, in, 1578, they, were, granted, permission, to, trade, in, canton, and, have, continued, to, do, so, since, then, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, between, 6, and, 30, tons, of, silver, were, transported, annually, from, portugal, to, macau, the, dutch, also, played, a, significant, role, in, the, trade, with, the, turnover, of, their, trade, at, the, turn, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, matching, that, of, the, portuguese, by, 1614, amsterdam, burghers,

european, traders, who, took, advantage, of, the, relative, cheapness, of, chinese, goods, as, a, result, chinese, silk, became, popular, in, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, latin, american, countries, like, peru, and, mexico, this, led, to, a, decline, in, local, silk, production, in, mexico, which, had, only, been, introduced, by, the, spanish, a, short, time, before, on, the, other, hand, the, textile, industry, which, utilized, chinese, silk, flourished, and, even, exported, to, european, markets, by, the, 1630s, there, was, a, significant, chinese, community, in, mexico, city,

to, the, ming, ban, on, trade, with, japan, the, import, of, japanese, silver, was, facilitated, by, the, portuguese, in, the, early, 17th, century, japanese, silver, exports, continued, to, rise, with, the, import, of, luxury, goods, such, as, silk, reaching, up, to, 280, tons, per, year, in, the, 1630s, silk, was, so, abundant, and, inexpensive, in, japan, that, even, some, peasants, were, able, to, afford, it, leading, to, a, rise, in, its, popularity, among, the, lower, classes, in, the, autumn, of, 1618, the, first, russian, ambassadors, arrived, in, beijing, led, by, ivan, petlin,
