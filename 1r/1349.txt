for, a, brief, period, in, 1959, although, it, technically, only, applied, to, asunci, n, after, 1970, the, courts, ruled, that, anyone, charged, with, security, offenses, could, be, brought, to, the, capital, and, charged, under, the, state, of, siege, provisions, even, if, the, offense, took, place, outside, the, capital, apart, from, one, 24, hour, period, on, election, days, stroessner, ruled, under, what, amounted, to, martial, law, for, nearly, all, of, his, tenure, a, devoted, anti, communist, who, brought, paraguay, into, the, world, anti, communist, league, he, justified, his, repression, as, a, necessary, measure, to, protect, the, country, the, use, of, political, repression, threats, and, death, squads, was, a, key, factor, in, stroessner, s, longevity, as, dictator, of, paraguay, he, maintained, virtually, unlimited, power, by, giving, a, free, hand, to, the, military, and, to, minister, of, interior, edgar, ynsfr, n, who, began, to, harass, terrorize, and, occasionally, murder, family, members, of, the, regime, s, opponents, stroessner, heavily, relied, on, various, colorado, party, militias, subordinated, to, his, control, to, crush, any, dissent, within, the, country, the, stroessner, regime, s, strong, anti, communist, stance, earned, it, the, support, of, the, united, states, with, which, it, enjoyed, close, military, and, economic, ties, and, supported, the, u, s, invasion, of, the, dominican, republic, the, stroessner, regime, even, offered, to, send, troops, to, vietnam, alongside, the, americans, the, united, states, played, a, critical, supporting, role, in, the, domestic, affairs, of, stoessner, s, paraguay, between, 1962, and, 1975, the, us, provided, 146, million, to, paraguay, s, military, government, and, paraguayan, officers, were, trained, at, the, u, s, army, school, of, the, americas, although, the, military, and, security, forces, under, stroessner, received, less, material, support, from, the, united, states, than, other, south, american, countries, strong, inter, military, connections, existed, through, military, advisors, and, military, training, between, 1962, and, 1966, nearly, 400, paraguayan, military, personnel, were, trained, by, the, united, states, in, the, panama, canal, zone, and, on, us, soil, strong, paraguayan, u, s, relations, continued, until, the, carter, administration, emphasized, a, foreign, policy, that, recognized, human, rights, abuses, although, both, military, and, economic, aid, were, allotted, to, the, paraguayan, government, in, carter, s, budgets, the, reagan, administration, restored, more, cordial, relations, due, to, stroessner, s, staunch, anti, communism, but, by, the, mid, 1980s, relations, cooled, largely, because, of, the, international, outcry, over, the, regime, s, excesses, along, with, its, involvement, in, narcotics, trafficking, and, money, laundering, in, 1986, the, reagan, administration, added, his, regime, to, its, list, of, latin, american, dictatorships, as, leader, of, the, colorado, party, stroessner, exercised, nearly, complete, control, over, the, nation, s, political, scene, although, opposition, parties, were, nominally, permitted, after, 1962, the, colorado, party, had, been, the, only, legal, party, in, the, country, since, 1947, paraguay, remained, for, all, intents, and, purposes, a, one, party, state, elections, were, so, heavily, rigged, in, favor, of, the, colorados, that, the, opposition, had, no, realistic, chance, of, winning, and, opposition, figures, were, subjected, to, varying, degrees, of, harassment, furthermore, stroessner, s, paraguay, became, a, haven, for, nazi, war, criminals, including, josef, mengele, and, non, communist, peaceful, opposition, was, crushed, given, stroessner, s, affinity, for, nazism, and, harboring, of, nazi, war, criminals, foreign, press, often, referred, to, his, government, as, the, poor, man, s, nazi, regime, stroessner, s, rule, brought, more, stability, than, most, of, the, country, s, living, residents, had, previously, known, from, 1927, to, 1954, the, country, had, had, 22, presidents, including, six, from, 1948, to, 1954, alone, however, that, stability, came, at, a, high, cost, corruption, was, rampant, stroessner, himself, did, not, dispute, charges, of, corruption, at, some, levels, in, his, government, and, paraguay, s, human, rights, record, was, considered, one, of, the, poorest, in, south, america, during, stroessner, s, regime, an, estimated, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, people, were, murdered, 400, to, 500, more, disappeared, and, thousands, more, imprisoned, and, tortured, press, freedom, was, also, limited, constitutional, guarantees, notwithstanding, any, outcry, about, government, mistreatment, or, attacks, toward, the, colorado, party, would, result, in, destruction, of, the, media, outlets, many, media, executives, were, sent, to, prison, or, tortured, because, of, this, political, opponents, were, few, and, far, between, near, the, end, of, this, presidency, he, declared, that, he, would, remove, the, state, of, siege, but, quickly, recanted, after, students, began, protesting, trolley, fares, for, the, first, 13, years, of, his, rule, stroessner, ruled, under, a, severely, authoritarian, constitution, enacted, in, 1940, in, the, mid, 1960s, in, an, attempt, to, placate, growing, international, criticism, stroessner, began, allowing, some, opposition, parties, to, function, although, these, functioned, as, opposition, in, name, only, stroessner, also, fired, the, interior, minister, ynsfr, n, in, 1966, but, his, replacement, sabino, augusto, montanaro, a, member, of, the, cuatrinomio, de, oro, a, group, of, politicians, intimately, connected, to, stroessner, continued, the, same, violent, policies, the, 1940, constitution, was, replaced, in, 1967, with, an, equally, repressive, document, like, its, predecessor, it, gave, the, president, broad, powers, to, take, exceptional, actions, for, the, good, of, the, country, such, as, suspending, civil, liberties, and, intervening, in, the, economy, it, thus, formed, the, legal, basis, for, the, state, of, virtual, martial, law, under, which, stroessner, governed, while, it, limited, the, president, to, two, five, year, terms, it, stipulated, that, only, those, terms, completed, after, the, 1968, election, would, count, toward, that, limit, in, 1977, faced, with, having, to, leave, office, for, good, the, following, year, stroessner, pushed, through, a, constitutional, amendment, allowing, him, to, run, for, an, unlimited, number, of, five, year, terms, paraguay, was, a, leading, participant, in, operation, condor, a, campaign, of, state, terror, and, security, operations, officially, implemented, in, 1975, which, were, jointly, conducted, by, the, military, dictatorships, of, six, south, american, countries, chile, argentina, bolivia, paraguay, uruguay, and, brazil, with, the, support, of, the, united, states, human, rights, violations, characteristic, of, those, in, other, south, american, countries, such, as, kidnappings, torture, forced, disappearances, and, extrajudicial, killings, were, routine, and, systematic, during, the, stroessner, regime, following, executions, many, of, the, bodies, of, those, killed, by, the, regime, were, dumped, in, the, chaco, or, the, r, o, paraguay, the, discovery, of, the, archives, of, terror, in, 1992, in, the, lambar, suburb, of, asunci, n, confirmed, allegations, of, widespread, human, rights, violations, during, stroessner, s, rule, two, special, departments, were, organized, under, the, ministry, of, the, interior, led, by, edgar, ynsfr, n, the, department, of, investigations, of, the, metropolitan, police, departamento, de, investigaciones, de, la, polic, a, de, la, capital, dipc, under, the, leadership, of, pastor, coronel, and, the, national, directorate, of, technical, affairs, direcci, n, nacional, de, asuntos, t, cnicos, dnat, directed, by, antonio, campos, alum, both, units, specialized, in, political, repression, pastor, coronel, became, infamous, for, his, brutality, he, would, interview, people, in, a, pileta, a, bath, of, human, vomit, and, excrement, or, ram, electric, cattle, prods, up, their, rectums, in, 1975, the, secretary, of, the, paraguayan, communist, party, miguel, ngel, soler, was, dismembered, alive, with, a, chainsaw, while, stroessner, listened, on, the, phone, the, screams, of, tortured, dissidents, were, often, recorded, and, played, over, the, phone, to, family, members, and, sometimes, the, bloody, garments, of, those, killed, were, sent, to, their, homes, under, stroessner, egregious, human, rights, violations, were, committed, against, the, indigenous, ach, population, of, paraguay, s, eastern, districts, largely, as, the, result, of, u, s, and, european, corporations, wanting, access, to, the, country, s, forests, mines, and, grazing, lands, the, ach, resided, on, land, that, was, coveted, and, had, resisted, relocation, attempts, by, the, paraguayan, army, the, government, retaliated, with, massacres, and, forced, many, ach, into, slavery, in, 1974, the, un, accused, paraguay, of, slavery, and, genocide, only, a, few, hundred, ach, remained, alive, by, the, late, 1970s, the, stroessner, regime, financed, this, genocide, with, u, s, aid, stroessner, was, careful, not, to, show, off, or, draw, attention, from, jealous, generals, or, foreign, journalists, he, avoided, rallies, and, took, simple, holidays, in, patagonia, he, became, more, tolerant, of, opposition, as, the, years, passed, but, there, was, no, change, in, the, regime, s, basic, character, during, stroessner, s, rule, no, socialist, nations, had, diplomatic, relations, with, paraguay, with, the, sole, exception, of, non, aligned, yugoslavia, stroessner, made, many, state, visits, including, to, japan, the, united, states, and, france, as, well, as, to, south, africa, a, country, which, paraguay, developed, close, bilateral, ties, with, in, the, 1970s, he, also, made, several, visits, to, west, germany, although, over, the, years, his, relations, with, that, country, deteriorated, since, he, had, always, been, known, as, pro, german, this, worsening, of, relations, combined, with, his, feeling, that, the, u, s, had, abandoned, him, was, regarded, as, a, personal, blow, to, stroessner, it, has, been, asserted, that, the, roman, catholic, church, is, the, only, reason, stroessner, did, not, have, absolute, control, over, the, country, after, the, destruction, of, asunci, n, university, in, 1972, by, police, the, archbishop, of, paraguay, ismael, rol, n, silvero, excommunicated, the, minister, of, the, interior, and, the, chief, of,

dedicated, large, proportions, of, the, paraguayan, national, budget, to, the, military, and, police, apparatus, both, fundamental, to, the, maintenance, of, the, regime, according, to, a, 1963, article, from, time, magazine, stroessner, spent, 33, of, the, 1962, annual, budget, on, army, and, police, 15, for, education, and, just, 2, for, public, works, there, was, no, income, tax, and, public, spending, was, the, smallest, percentage, of, gdp, in, latin, america, stroessner, enacted, several, economic, development, projects, including, the, building, of, the, itaipu, dam, the, largest, hydroelectric, power, plant, in, the, world, at, the, time, although, paraguay, received, only, 15, of, the, contracts, it, was, a, major, factor, in, the, country, having, the, highest, rate, of, growth, in, latin, america, for, most, of, the, 1970s, the, construction, of, the, itaipu, dam, as, well, as, that, of, the, subsequent, yacyret, dam, on, the, paraguay, argentina, border, displaced, thousands, of, paraguayans, often, without, any, restitution, the, itaipu, dam, displaced, at, least, 80, 000, paraguayans, and, the, yacyret, was, estimated, to, have, displaced, at, least, as, many, by, december, 2008, 160, workers, died, building, the, itaipu, dam, stroessner, also, promoted, projects, that, purportedly, developed, the, country, s, infrastructure, amongst, these, were, the, improvement, of, highways, and, the, issuing, of, 15, 20, hectare, land, grants, to, military, personnel, upon, completion, of, their, service, provided, that, the, land, would, be, used, for, farming, purposes, over, 10, 000, soldiers, took, up, this, offer, by, the, end, of, the, stronato, the, second, biggest, city, was, puerto, flor, de, lis, renamed, puerto, presidente, stroessner, then, ciudad, del, este, founded, just, 32, years, before, in, april, 1987, stroessner, lifted, the, state, of, siege, as, part, of, the, run, up, to, elections, the, following, spring, however, several, draconian, security, laws, remained, in, effect, meaning, that, the, substance, if, not, the, form, of, the, state, of, siege, was, still, in, place, as, had, been, the, case, for, over, three, decades, opposition, leaders, continued, to, be, arbitrarily, arrested, and, opposition, meetings, and, demonstrations, were, broken, up, often, brutally, stroessner, was, nominated, by, the, colorados, once, again, and, was, the, only, candidate, who, was, allowed, to, campaign, completely, unmolested, under, these, circumstances, the, february, 1988, election, was, no, different, from, past, elections, with, stroessner, officially, registering, 89, percent, of, the, vote, a, margin, that, his, rivals, contended, could, have, been, obtained, only, through, massive, fraud, on, 3, february, 1989, only, six, months, after, being, sworn, in, for, what, would, have, been, his, eighth, full, term, stroessner, was, ousted, in, a, coup, d, tat, led, by, general, andr, s, rodr, guez, his, closest, confidant, for, over, three, decades, one, reason, for, the, coup, was, that, the, generals, feared, one, of, stroessner, s, offspring, would, succeed, him, of, the, two, alfredo, was, a, cocaine, addict, and, gustavo, a, pilot, was, loathed, for, being, homosexual, a, more, outlandish, rumour, was, that, lino, oviedo, threatened, rodr, guez, with, a, grenade, if, he, did, not, launch, the, coup, the, two, generals, rodr, guez, and, oviedo, fought, a, brief, artillery, duel, over, asunci, n, after, the, coup, stroessner, fled, to, brazil, where, he, lived, in, exile, for,

his, son, were, able, to, return, to, paraguay, to, attend, her, funeral, stroessner, engaged, in, extramarital, affairs, before, and, during, his, presidency, according, to, many, sources, he, also, engaged, in, child, abuse, with, girls, as, young, as, 8, years, old, as, a, result, of, this, he, may, have, fathered, over, 30, illegitimate, children, the, affairs, and, child, abuse, were,

possibility, of, reelection, even, if, nonsuccessive, the, ban, on, any, sort, of, reelection, has, become, so, entrenched, in, paraguayan, politics, that, in, 2017, when, the, legislature, debated, an, amendment, that, would, have, allowed, then, president, horacio, cartes, to, run, for, reelection, massive, protests, forced, the, colorados, to, abandon, those, plans
