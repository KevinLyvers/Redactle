sequoyah, s, k, w, s, quoy, y, cherokee, ssiquoya, or, sequoya, pronounced, c, 1770, august, 1843, also, known, as, george, gist, or, george, guess, was, a, native, american, polymath, and, neographer, of, the, cherokee, nation, in, 1821, he, completed, his, independent, creation, of, the, cherokee, syllabary, enabling, reading, and, writing, in, cherokee, his, achievement, was, one, of, the, few, times, in, recorded, history, that, an, individual, member, of, a, pre, literate, group, created, an, original, effective, writing, system, his, creation, of, the, syllabary, turned, the, cherokee, nation, into, one, of, the, first, north, american, indigenous, groups, with, a, written, language, sequoyah, was, also, an, important, representative, for, the, cherokee, nation, he, went, to, washington, d, c, to, sign, two, relocation, and, land, trading, treaties, the, people, of, the, cherokee, nation, rapidly, began, to, use, his, syllabary, and, officially, adopted, it, in, 1825, it, unified, a, forcibly, divided, nation, with, new, ways, of, communication, and, a, sense, of, independence, by, the, 1850s, their, literacy, rate, reached, almost, 100, surpassing, that, of, surrounding, european, american, settlers, the, cherokee, syllabary, is, believed, to, have, inspired, the, development, of, 21, scripts, or, writing, systems, used, in, a, total, of, 65, languages, in, north, america, africa, and, asia, sequoyah, s, important, status, has, led, to, several, competing, accounts, of, his, life, that, are, speculative, contradictory, or, fabricated, as, noted, by, john, b, davis, there, were, few, primary, documents, describing, facts, of, sequoyah, s, life, some, anecdotes, were, passed, down, orally, but, these, often, conflict, or, are, vague, about, specific, times, and, places, sequoyah, was, born, in, the, cherokee, town, of, tuskegee, tennessee, around, 1778, james, mooney, a, prominent, anthropologist, and, historian, of, the, cherokee, people, quoted, a, cousin, as, saying, that, as, a, little, boy, sequoyah, spent, his, early, years, with, his, mother, in, the, people, s, matrilineal, kinship, system, children, were, considered, born, into, their, mother, s, family, and, clan, and, her, male, relatives, were, most, important, to, their, upbringing, his, name, is, believed, to, come, from, the, cherokee, word, siqua, meaning, hog, however, davis, says, the, name, may, have, been, derived, from, sikwa, either, a, hog, or, an, opossum, and, vi, meaning, place, enclosure, this, is, a, reference, either, to, his, childhood, deformity, or, to, a, later, injury, that, left, sequoyah, disabled, according, to, a, descendant, of, his, he, was, born, with, the, name, gi, sqwa, ya, which, means, there, s, a, bird, inside, after, repeatedly, failing, to, complete, his, farm, duties, his, name, was, changed, to, sequoyah, which, means, there, s, a, pig, inside, his, mother, wut, teh, is, debated, to, be, either, the, daughter, sister, or, niece, of, a, cherokee, chief, historians, believe, her, to, be, related, to, the, chiefs, who, have, been, identified, as, the, brothers, old, tassel, and, doublehead, john, watts, also, known, as, young, tassel, was, a, nephew, of, the, two, chiefs, so, it, is, likely, that, wut, teh, and, john, watts, were, related, in, some, fashion, due, to, native, customs, sequoyah, learned, everything, from, his, mother, like, the, cherokee, language, and, his, first, job, of, a, tradesman, sources, differ, as, to, the, true, identity, of, sequoyah, s, father, john, b, davis, cites, emmet, starr, s, book, early, history, of, the, cherokees, as, the, source, for, saying, that, sequoyah, s, father, was, a, virginian, fur, trader, from, swabia, named, nathaniel, guyst, guist, or, gist, other, sources, state, that, his, father, also, could, have, been, an, unlicensed, german, peddler, named, george, gist, who, came, into, the, cherokee, nation, in, 1768, where, he, married, and, fathered, a, child, another, source, identified, his, father, as, nathaniel, gist, son, of, christopher, gist, who, became, a, commissioned, officer, with, the, continental, army, associated, with, george, washington, during, the, american, revolution, gist, would, have, been, a, man, of, some, social, status, and, financial, backing, josiah, c, nott, claimed, he, was, the, son, of, a, scotchman, the, cherokee, phoenix, reported, in, 1828, that, sequoyah, s, father, was, a, half, blood, and, his, grandfather, a, white, man, the, new, georgia, encyclopedia, presents, another, version, of, sequoyah, s, origins, from, the, history, tell, them, they, lie, the, sequoyah, myth, 1971, by, traveller, bird, who, claims, to, be, a, sequoyah, descendant, bird, says, that, sequoyah, was, a, full, blood, cherokee, who, always, opposed, the, submission, and, assimilation, of, his, people, into, the, white, man, s, culture, the, encyclopedia, noted, that, bird, presented, no, documentary, evidence, of, his, assertions, but, his, account, has, gained, some, credibility, in, academic, circles, in, any, case, the, father, was, absent, before, sequoyah, was, born, various, explanations, have, been, proposed, but, the, reason, is, unknown, wuh, teh, did, not, remarry, afterward, assuming, she, married, her, son, s, father, in, the, first, place, sequoyah, had, no, siblings, and, his, mother, raised, him, alone, according, to, davis, sequoyah, never, went, to, school, and, never, learned, english, he, and, wuh, teh, spoke, only, cherokee, as, a, youth, he, spent, much, of, his, time, tending, cattle, and, working, in, their, garden, while, his, mother, ran, a, trading, post, sequoyah, became, lame, early, in, life, though, how, when, and, where, are, not, known, some, reports, indicate, this, may, have, been, caused, by, injury, in, battle, others, say, the, cause, was, a, hunting, accident, davis, wrote, that, an, early, issue, of, the, cherokee, advocate, said, that, he, was, the, victim, of, a, hydrarthritic, trouble, of, the, knee, joint, commonly, called, white, swelling, one, doctor, speculated, that, he, had, anascara, in, any, case, lameness, prevented, him, from, being, a, successful, farmer, or, warrior, despite, his, lack, of, schooling, sequoyah, displayed, much, natural, intelligence, as, a, child, he, had, devised, and, built, milk, troughs, and, skimmers, for, the, dairy, house, that, he, had, constructed, as, he, grew, older, and, came, in, contact, with, more, white, men, he, learned, how, to, make, jewelry, he, became, a, noted, silversmith, creating, various, items, from, the, silver, coins, that, trappers, and, traders, carried, he, never, signed, his, pieces, so, there, are, none, that, can, be, positively, identified, as, his, work, sequoyah, possibly, took, over, his, mother, s, trading, post, after, her, death, which, historian, john, b, davis, claimed, occurred, about, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, his, store, became, an, informal, meeting, place, for, cherokee, men, to, socialize, and, especially, drink, whiskey, sequoyah, developed, a, great, fondness, for, alcohol, and, soon, spent, much, of, his, time, drunk, after, a, few, months, he, was, rarely, seen, sober, neglecting, his, farm, and, trading, business, and, spending, his, money, buying, liquor, by, the, keg, fortunately, he, realized, that, he, was, not, making, good, decisions, and, took, up, new, interests, he, began, to, draw, then, he, took, up, blacksmithing, so, he, could, repair, the, iron, farm, implements, that, had, recently, been, introduced, to, the, area, by, traders, self, taught, as, usual, he, made, his, own, tools, forge, and, bellows, he, was, soon, doing, a, good, business, either, repairing, items, or, selling, items, he, had, created, himself, his, spurs, and, bridle, bits, were, in, great, demand, because, he, liked, to, decorate, them, with, silver, although, he, maintained, his, store, he, both, stopped, drinking, and, stopped, selling, alcohol, up, to, this, point, while, sequoyah, was, not, formally, educated, he, recognized, the, advantage, that, comes, with, an, established, written, language, he, believed, one, of, white, people, s, many, advantages, was, their, written, language, as, it, allowed, them, to, expand, their, knowledge, partake, in, many, forms, of, media, and, have, a, better, network, of, communication, the, cherokee, s, disadvantage, was, having, to, rely, solely, on, memory, which, sparked, his, interest, in, wanting, to, create, some, form, of, a, written, language, for, the, cherokee, nation, by, 1809, sequoyah, is, believed, to, have, started, developing, what, became, his, cherokee, syllabary, in, hopes, of, unifying, the, cherokee, nation, and, making, them, more, independent, in, 2008, archeologist, kenneth, b, tankersley, cherokee, nation, of, the, university, of, cincinnati, announced, having, found, carvings, from, the, syllabary, in, a, cave, in, southeastern, kentucky, where, sequoyah, is, known, to, have, had, relatives, this, cave, was, the, traditional, burial, site, of, a, cherokee, chief, red, bird, some, 15, identifiable, cherokee, syllabary, symbols, were, found, carved, into, the, limestone, accompanied, by, a, date, of, 1808, or, 1818, in, addition, there, were, petroglyphs, that, appeared, to, include, ancient, cherokee, symbols, in, addition, to, bears, deer, and, birds, it, is, unclear, when, sequoyah, initially, moved, to, alabama, from, tennessee, many, cherokee, began, migrating, there, even, before, ceding, their, land, around, sequoyah, s, birthplace, in, 1819, as, they, were, under, continual, pressure, by, european, american, settlers, some, sources, claim, he, went, with, his, mother, though, there, is, no, confirmed, date, for, her, death, others, have, stated, that, it, was, around, 1809, when, he, started, his, work, on, the, cherokee, syllabary, another, source, claims, it, was, in, 1818, however, this, date, is, too, late, because, sequoyah, was, already, living, in, alabama, when, he, enlisted, in, the, army, in, 1813, 1814, sequoyah, served, as, a, warrior, of, the, cherokee, regiment, col, gideon, morgan, commander, at, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, against, the, red, sticks, creek, or, muskogee, renegades, his, white, comrades, called, him, either, george, guess, or, george, gist, the, creek, war, had, started, during, the, period, of, the, war, of, 1812, and, represented, an, effort, by, traditional, creek, to, assert, their, power, within, the, people, and, expel, the, european, americans, while, serving, sequoyah, witnessed, the, disadvantages, of, not, having, a, written, language, unlike, the, white, soldiers, he, and, his, fellow, cherokee, warriors, could, not, write, letters, to, home, read, their, military, orders, or, write, down, any, events, or, thoughts, that, occurred, during, their, service, this, only, pushed, his, determination, to, create, a, reading, and, writing, system, for, the, cherokee, language, in, his, early, stages, of, developing, the, writing, system, he, faced, criticism, from, his, peers, because, they, believed, putting, words, to, paper, was, witchcraft, in, 1817, sequoyah, signed, a, treaty, which, traded, cherokee, land, in, the, southeast, for, land, in, arkansas, but, in, 1819, he, backed, out, of, the, treaty, which, resulted, in, the, loss, of, his, first, alabama, home, causing, him, to, move, to, willstown, modern, day, fort, payne, alabama, sequoyah, s, syllabary, was, completed, about, 1821, but, it, was, not, accepted, by, the, cherokee, nation, at, first, but, after, the, people, began, to, see, its, value, the, syllabary, quickly, spread, and, sequoyah, was, awarded, a, medal, from, the, cherokee, national, council, in, 1824, this, same, year, sequoyah, moved, from, alabama, to, arkansas, four, years, after, his, move, he, would, reluctantly, sign, a, treaty, that, exchanged, the, cherokee, land, in, arkansas, for, indian, territory, modern, day, oklahoma, he, was, one, of, the, old, settler, delegates, that, went, to, washington, d, c, to, sign, the, treaty, in, 1829, sequoyah, settled, in, present, day, sallisaw, oklahoma, with, his, wife, and, daughter, in, 1838, the, cherokees, from, the, southeast, were, relocated, to, indian, territory, under, chief, john, ross, after, this, relocation, sequoyah, set, out, to, unite, the, 16, other, old, settlers, with, the, ross, party, because, they, already, established, their, own, government, in, 1839, sequoyah, and, the, 16, other, old, settlers, and, about, 15, representatives, of, the, ross, party, signed, the, act, of, union, and, a, new, cherokee, constitution, was, created, soon, after, the, signing, of, the, new, cherokee, constitution, sequoyah, went, to, mexico, in, search, for, other, cherokees, who, migrated, there, he, was, hoping, to, spread, his, teachings, of, the, syllabary, and, convince, the, migrated, cherokees, to, relocate, to, indian, territory, as, a, silversmith, sequoyah, dealt, regularly, with, european, americans, who, had, settled, in, the, area, he, was, impressed, by, their, writing, and, referred, to, their, correspondence, as, talking, leaves, he, knew, that, the, papers, represented, a, way, to, transmit, information, to, other, people, in, distant, places, which, his, fellow, american, soldiers, were, able, to, do, but, he, and, other, indigenous, people, could, not, a, majority, of, the, cherokee, believed, that, writing, was, either, sorcery, witchcraft, a, special, gift, or, a, pretense, sequoyah, accepted, none, of, these, explanations, he, said, that, he, could, invent, a, way, for, cherokees, to, talk, on, paper, even, though, his, friends, and, family, thought, the, idea, was, absurd, around, 1809, sequoyah, began, creating, a, system, of, writing, for, the, cherokee, language, over, the, years, his, approach, was, to, use, a, pictograph, or, logographic, system, where, every, word, in, the, language, had, a, character, or, symbol, as, he, failed, to, plant, his, fields, endangering, his, survival, his, friends, and, neighbors, thought, he, had, lost, his, mind, his, wife, is, said, to, have, burned, his, initial, work, believing, it, to, be, witchcraft, he, realized, that, his, first, approach, was, impractical, because, it, would, require, too, many, pictures, to, be, remembered, he, tried, making, a, symbol, for, every, idea, but, this, also, caused, too, many, problems, to, be, practical, sequoyah, s, final, attempt, was, to, develop, a, symbol, for, each, syllable, in, the, language, using, the, bible, as, a, reference, along, with, adaptations, from, english, greek, and, hebrew, letters, by, 1821, he, created, 86, symbols, later, to, be, 85, symbols, that, depict, the, syllables, of, the, cherokee, language, the, syllabary, is, not, an, alphabet, but, a, chart, or, guide, to, represent, each, symbol, that, stands, for, a, consonant, vowel, sequence, or, a, syllable, the, symbols, are, written, in, a, chart, layout, with, the, columns, being, each, vowel, and, the, rows, being, each, consonant, sequoyah, s, six, year, old, daughter, ayokeh, also, spelled, ayoka, helped, him, in, his, process, to, create, the, syllabary, by, being, the, first, person, to, learn, from, it, word, spread, in, their, town, that, they, created, a, new, way, to, communicate, and, they, were, charged, and, brought, to, trial, by, the, town, chief, sequoyah, and, ayokeh, were, separated, but, still, communicated, by, sending, letters, to, one, another, eventually, the, warriors, presiding, over, their, trial, along, with, the, town, believed, that, sequoyah, did, in, fact, create, a, new, form, of, communication, and, they, all, wanted, him, to, teach, it, to, them, he, traveled, to, the, indian, reserves, in, the, arkansas, territory, where, some, cherokee, had, settled, west, of, the, mississippi, river, when, he, tried, to, convince, the, local, leaders, of, the, syllabary, s, usefulness, they, doubted, him, sequoyah, asked, each, leader, to, say, a, word, which, he, wrote, down, and, then, called, his, daughter, in, to, read, the, words, back, this, demonstration, convinced, the, leaders, to, let, him, teach, the, syllabary, to, a, few, more, people, this, took, several, months, during, which, it, was, rumored, that, he, might, be, using, the, students, for, sorcery, after, completing, the, lessons, sequoyah, wrote, a, dictated, letter, to, each, student, and, read, a, dictated, response, this, test, convinced, the, western, cherokee, that, he, had, created, a, practical, writing, system, when, sequoyah, went, to, the, eastern, tribes, he, brought, a, sealed, envelope, containing, a, written, speech, from, one, of, the, arkansas, cherokee, leaders, by, reading, this, speech, he, convinced, the, eastern, cherokee, to, also, learn, the, system, and, from, there, it, continued, to, be, taught, across, the, cherokee, tribes, and, towns, in, the, east, the, syllabary, was, not, hard, for, the, cherokee, people, to, learn, and, by, 1830, 90, of, cherokees, were, literate, in, their, own, language, over, time, naturally, tribes, began, to, form, their, own, dialects, depending, on, what, region, they, lived, in, there, are, two, main, dialects, the, eastern, and, western, the, eastern, dialect, also, referred, to, as, middle, or, kituwa, dialect, is, spoken, in, the, qualla, boundary, in, western, north, carolina, this, land, was, purchased, by, the, cherokees, in, the, 1870s, the, western, dialect, also, known, as, overhill, or, otali, dialect, is, spoken, in, eastern, oklahoma, and, north, carolina, there, was, a, southern, dialect, also, called, lower, dialect, spoken, in, south, carolina, and, georgia, until, around, 1900, but, since, no, more, cherokee, tribes, reside, there, that, style, of, dialect, is, no, more, in, 1825, the, cherokee, nation, officially, adopted, the, writing, system, the, syllabary, provided, mass, literacy, for, the, cherokee, nation, which, was, one, of, the, first, indigenous, groups, to, have, a, functional, written, language, by, the, end, of, 1825, the, bible, and, hymns, were, translated, into, cherokee, in, 1826, the, cherokee, national, council, commissioned, george, lowrey, and, david, brown, to, translate, and, print, eight, copies, of, the, laws, of, the, cherokee, nation, in, the, cherokee, language, using, sequoyah, s, new, system, in, 1828, the, cherokee, phoenix, religious, pamphlets, educational, materials, and, legal, documents, were, all, made, using, the, syllabary, the, cherokee, phoenix, was, the, first, bilingual, newspaper, in, north, america, because, it, had, both, english, and, cherokee, languages, this, newspaper, helped, keep, unity, in, a, dispersed, cherokee, nation, by, allowing, them, to, have, their, own, network, of, communication, and, information, the, syllabary, was, used, for, over, 100, years, to, make, newspapers, books, religious, texts, and, almanacs, calendars, when, the, cherokee, nation, purchased, their, first, printing, press, some, of, sequoyah, s, handwritten, symbols, needed, to, be, modified, to, make, the, symbols, more, clear, they, were, replaced, by, adaptations, from, the, roman, alphabet, and, used, in, the, syllabary, from, that, point, on, after, the, nation, accepted, his, syllabary, in, 1825, sequoyah, traveled, to, the, cherokee, lands, in, the, arkansas, territory, there, he, set, up, a, blacksmith, shop, and, a, salt, works, he, continued, to, teach, the, syllabary, to, anyone, who, wished, in, 1828, sequoyah, journeyed, to, washington, d, c, as, part, of, a, delegation, to, negotiate, a, treaty, for, land, in, the, planned, indian, territory, while, in, washington, d, c, he, sat, for, a, formal, portrait, painted, by, charles, bird, king, see, image, at, the, top, of, this, article, he, holds, a, copy, of, the, syllabary, in, his, left, hand, and, is, smoking, a, long, stemmed, pipe, during, his, trip, he, met, representatives, of, other, native, american, tribes, inspired, by, these, meetings, he, decided, to, create, a, syllabary, for, universal, use, among, native, american, tribes, sequoyah, began, to, journey, into, areas, of, present, day, arizona, and, new, mexico, to, meet, with, tribes, there, in, 1829, sequoyah, moved, to, a, location, on, big, skin, bayou, where, he, built, sequoyah, s, cabin, that, became, his, home, for, the, rest, of, his, life, it, was, declared, a, national, historic, landmark, in, 1965, the, present, day, city, of, sallisaw, oklahoma, developed, near, here, the, house, was, operated, by, the, oklahoma, historical, society, until, it, was, purchased, by, the, cherokee, nation, on, 9, november, 2016, in, 1839, when, the, cherokee, were, bitterly, divided, over, the, issue, of, removal, to, indian, territory, sequoyah, joined, with, jesse, bushyhead, to, try, to, reunite, the, cherokee, nation, sequoyah, representing, the, western, cherokee, and, bushyhead, representing, the, eastern, cherokee, made, a, joint, plea, at, a, tribal, council, meeting, at, takatoka, on, 20, june, 1839, they, succeeded, in, getting, a, voice, vote, to, hold, a, new, council, of, all, cherokee, to, resolve, the, reunification, issues, this, is, when, the, act, of, union, and, a, new, cherokee, constitution, was, created, sequoyah, dreamed, of, seeing, reunification, of, the, splintered, cherokee, nation, in, the, spring, of, 1842, he, began, a, trip, to, locate, other, cherokee, bands, who, were, believed, to, have, fled, to, mexico, and, attempted, to, persuade, them, to, return, to, the, cherokee, nation, by, then, mostly, residing, in, indian, territory, he, was, accompanied, by, his, son, teesy, chusaleta, as, well, as, other, cherokee, men, identified, as, co, tes, ka, nu, wo, ta, na, cah, ta, ta, co, wo, si, ti, john, elijah, and, the, worm, in, the, summer, of, 1842, influenced, perhaps, by, a, desire, to, explore, the, western, prairies, and, become, acquainted, with, his, red, brethren, who, roam, them, free, and, untrammlled, se, quo, yah, having, loaded, several, pack, horses, with, goods, visited, in, company, with, a, number, of, cherokees, the, cumanche, indians, after, remaining, with, them, some, time, he, made, his, way, with, a, son, and, two, or, three, other, cherokees, into, northern, mexico, toward, chi, hua, hua, and, engaged, a, while, in, teaching, the, mexicans, his, native, language, sometime, between, 1843, and, 1845, he, died, due, to, an, estimated, respiratory, infection, during, a, trip, to, san, fernando, de, rosas, in, coahuila, mexico, a, letter, written, in, 1845, by, accompanying, cherokee, stated, that, he, had, died, in, 1843, warren, s, trading, house, red, river, april, 21st, 1845, we, the, undersigned, cherokees, direct, from, the, spanish, dominions, do, hereby, certify, that, george, guess, of, the, cherokee, nation, arkansas, departed, this, life, in, the, town, of, san, fernando, in, the, month, of, august, 1843, and, his, son, chusaleta, is, at, this, time, on, the, brasos, river, texas, about, thirty, miles, above, the, falls, and, he, intends, returning, home, this, fall, given, under, our, hands, the, day, and, date, written, standing, x, rock, his, mark, standing, x, bowles, his, mark, watch, x, justice, his, mark, witnesses, daniel, g,

find, sequoyah, s, grave, in, mexico, a, party, of, cherokee, and, non, cherokee, scholars, embarked, from, eagle, pass, texas, on, january, 1939, they, found, a, grave, site, near, a, fresh, water, spring, in, coahuila, mexico, but, could, not, conclusively, determine, the, grave, site, was, that, of, sequoyah, in, 2011, the, muskogee, phoenix, published, an, article, relating, a, discovery, in, 1903, of, a, gravesite, in, the, wichita, mountains, by, hayes, and, fancher, which, they, believed, was, sequoyah, s, the, two, men, said, the, site, was, in, a, cave, and, contained, a, human, skeleton, with, one, leg, shorter, than, the, other, a, long, stemmed, pipe, two, silver, medals, a, flintlock, rifle, and, an, ax, however, the, site, was, far, north, of, the, mexican, border, sequoyah, s, work, has, had, international, influence, encouraging, the, development, of, syllabaries, for, other, previously, unwritten, languages, the, news, that, an, illiterate, cherokee, had,
