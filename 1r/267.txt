john, dryden, d, r, a, d, n, 19, august, 1631, 12, may, 1700, was, an, english, poet, literary, critic, translator, and, playwright, who, in, 1668, was, appointed, england, s, first, poet, laureate, he, is, seen, as, dominating, the, literary, life, of, restoration, england, to, such, a, point, that, the, period, came, to, be, known, in, literary, circles, as, the, age, of, dryden, romantic, writer, sir, walter, scott, called, him, glorious, john, dryden, was, born, in, the, village, rectory, of, aldwincle, near, thrapston, in, northamptonshire, where, his, maternal, grandfather, was, the, rector, of, all, saints, he, was, the, eldest, of, fourteen, children, born, to, erasmus, dryden, and, wife, mary, pickering, paternal, grandson, of, sir, erasmus, dryden, 1st, barone, t, 1553, 1632, and, wife, frances, wilkes, puritan, landowning, gentry, who, supported, the, puritan, cause, and, parliament, he, was, a, second, cousin, once, removed, of, jonathan, swift, as, a, boy, dryden, lived, in, the, nearby, village, of, titchmarsh, where, it, is, likely, that, he, received, his, first, education, in, 1644, he, was, sent, to, westminster, school, as, a, king, s, scholar, where, his, headmaster, was, richard, busby, a, charismatic, teacher, and, severe, disciplinarian, having, been, re, founded, by, elizabeth, i, westminster, during, this, period, embraced, a, very, different, religious, and, political, spirit, encouraging, royalism, and, high, anglicanism, whatever, dryden, s, response, to, this, was, he, clearly, respected, the, headmaster, and, would, later, send, two, of, his, sons, to, school, at, westminster, as, a, humanist, public, school, westminster, maintained, a, curriculum, which, trained, pupils, in, the, art, of, rhetoric, and, the, presentation, of, arguments, for, both, sides, of, a, given, issue, this, is, a, skill, which, would, remain, with, dryden, and, influence, his, later, writing, and, thinking, as, much, of, it, displays, these, dialectical, patterns, the, westminster, curriculum, included, weekly, translation, assignments, which, developed, dryden, s, capacity, for, assimilation, this, was, also, to, be, exhibited, in, his, later, works, his, years, at, westminster, were, not, uneventful, and, his, first, published, poem, an, elegy, with, a, strong, royalist, feel, on, the, death, of, his, schoolmate, henry, lord, hastings, from, smallpox, alludes, to, the, execution, of, king, charles, i, which, took, place, on, 30, january, 1649, very, near, the, school, where, busby, had, first, prayed, for, the, king, and, then, locked, in, his, schoolboys, to, prevent, their, attending, the, spectacle, in, 1650, dryden, went, up, to, trinity, college, cambridge, here, he, would, have, experienced, a, return, to, the, religious, and, political, ethos, of, his, childhood, the, master, of, trinity, was, a, puritan, preacher, by, the, name, of, thomas, hill, who, had, been, a, rector, in, dryden, s, home, village, though, there, is, little, specific, information, on, dryden, s, undergraduate, years, he, would, most, certainly, have, followed, the, standard, curriculum, of, classics, rhetoric, and, mathematics, in, 1654, he, obtained, his, ba, graduating, top, of, the, list, for, trinity, that, year, in, june, of, the, same, year, dryden, s, father, died, leaving, him, some, land, which, generated, a, little, income, but, not, enough, to, live, on, returning, to, london, during, the, protectorate, dryden, obtained, work, with, oliver, cromwell, s, secretary, of, state, john, thurloe, this, appointment, may, have, been, the, result, of, influence, exercised, on, his, behalf, by, his, cousin, the, lord, chamberlain, sir, gilbert, pickering, at, cromwell, s, funeral, on, 23, november, 1658, dryden, processed, with, the, puritan, poets, john, milton, and, andrew, marvell, shortly, thereafter, he, published, his, first, important, poem, heroic, stanzas, 1659, a, eulogy, on, cromwell, s, death, which, is, cautious, and, prudent, in, its, emotional, display, in, 1660, dryden, celebrated, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, and, the, return, of, charles, ii, with, astraea, redux, an, authentic, royalist, panegyric, in, this, work, the, interregnum, is, illustrated, as, a, time, of, chaos, and, charles, is, seen, as, the, restorer, of, peace, and, order, after, the, restoration, as, dryden, quickly, established, himself, as, the, leading, poet, and, literary, critic, of, his, day, he, transferred, his, allegiances, to, the, new, government, along, with, astraea, redux, dryden, welcomed, the, new, regime, with, two, more, panegyrics, to, his, sacred, majesty, a, panegyric, on, his, coronation, 1662, and, to, my, lord, chancellor, 1662, these, poems, suggest, that, dryden, was, looking, to, court, a, possible, patron, but, he, was, to, instead, make, a, living, in, writing, for, publishers, not, for, the, aristocracy, and, thus, ultimately, for, the, reading, public, these, and, his, other, nondramatic, poems, are, occasional, that, is, they, celebrate, public, events, thus, they, are, written, for, the, nation, rather, than, the, self, and, the, poet, laureate, as, he, would, later, become, is, obliged, to, write, a, certain, number, of, these, per, annum, in, november, 1662, dryden, was, proposed, for, membership, in, the, royal, society, and, he, was, elected, an, early, fellow, however, dryden, was, inactive, in, society, affairs, and, in, 1666, was, expelled, for, non, payment, of, his, dues, on, 1, december, 1663, dryden, married, the, royalist, sister, of, sir, robert, howard, lady, elizabeth, dryden, s, works, occasionally, contain, outbursts, against, the, married, state, but, also, celebrations, of, the, same, thus, little, is, known, of, the, intimate, side, of, his, marriage, lady, elizabeth, bore, three, sons, one, of, whom, erasmus, henry, became, a, roman, catholic, priest, with, the, reopening, of, the, theatres, in, 1660, after, the, puritan, ban, dryden, began, writing, plays, his, first, play, the, wild, gallant, appeared, in, 1663, and, was, not, successful, but, was, still, promising, and, from, 1668, on, he, was, contracted, to, produce, three, plays, a, year, for, the, king, s, company, in, which, he, became, a, shareholder, during, the, 1660s, and, 1670s, theatrical, writing, was, his, main, source, of, income, he, led, the, way, in, restoration, comedy, his, best, known, work, being, marriage, la, mode, 1673, as, well, as, heroic, tragedy, and, regular, tragedy, in, which, his, greatest, success, was, all, for, love, 1678, dryden, was, never, satisfied, with, his, theatrical, writings, and, frequently, suggested, that, his, talents, were, wasted, on, unworthy, audiences, he, thus, was, making, a, bid, for, poetic, fame, off, stage, in, 1667, around, the, same, time, his, dramatic, career, began, he, published, annus, mirabilis, a, lengthy, historical, poem, which, described, the, english, defeat, of, the, dutch, naval, fleet, and, the, great, fire, of, london, in, 1666, it, was, a, modern, epic, in, pentameter, quatrains, that, established, him, as, the, preeminent, poet, of, his, generation, and, was, crucial, in, his, attaining, the, posts, of, poet, laureate, 1668, and, historiographer, royal, 1670, when, the, great, plague, of, london, closed, the, theatres, in, 1665, dryden, retreated, to, wiltshire, where, he, wrote, of, dramatick, poesie, 1668, arguably, the, best, of, his, unsystematic, prefaces, and, essays, dryden, constantly, defended, his, own, literary, practice, and, of, dramatick, poesie, the, longest, of, his, critical, works, takes, the, form, of, a, dialogue, in, which, four, characters, each, based, on, a, prominent, contemporary, with, dryden, himself, as, neander, debate, the, merits, of, classical, french, and, english, drama, the, greater, part, of, his, critical, works, introduce, problems, which, he, is, eager, to, discuss, and, show, the, work, of, a, writer, of, independent, mind, who, feels, strongly, about, his, own, ideas, ideas, which, demonstrate, the, breadth, of, his, reading, he, felt, strongly, about, the, relation, of, the, poet, to, tradition, and, the, creative, process, and, his, best, heroic, play, aureng, zebe, 1675, has, a, prologue, which, denounces, the, use, of, rhyme, in, serious, drama, his, play, all, for, love, 1678, was, written, in, blank, verse, and, was, to, immediately, follow, aureng, zebe, dryden, s, poem, an, essay, upon, satire, contained, a, number, of, attacks, on, king, charles, ii, his, mistresses, and, courtiers, but, most, pointedly, on, the, earl, of, rochester, a, notorious, womaniser, rochester, responded, by, hiring, thugs, who, attacked, dryden, whilst, walking, back, from, will, s, coffee, house, a, popular, london, coffee, house, where, the, wits, gathered, to, gossip, drink, and, conduct, their, business, to, his, house, on, gerrard, street, at, around, 8, pm, on, 18, december, 1679, dryden, was, attacked, in, rose, alley, behind, the, lamb, flag, pub, near, his, home, in, covent, garden, dryden, survived, the, attack, offering, 50, for, the, identity, of, the, thugs, placed, in, the, london, gazette, and, a, royal, pardon, if, one, of, them, would, confess, no, one, claimed, the, reward, dryden, s, greatest, achievements, were, in, satiric, verse, the, mock, heroic, mac, flecknoe, a, more, personal, product, of, his, laureate, years, was, a, lampoon, circulated, in, manuscript, and, an, attack, on, the, playwright, thomas, shadwell, dryden, s, main, goal, in, the, work, is, to, satirize, shadwell, ostensibly, for, his, offenses, against, literature, but, more, immediately, we, may, suppose, for, his, habitual, badgering, of, him, on, the, stage, and, in, print, it, is, not, a, belittling, form, of, satire, but, rather, one, which, makes, his, object, great, in, ways, which, are, unexpected, transferring, the, ridiculous, into, poetry, this, line, of, satire, continued, with, absalom, and, achitophel, 1681, and, the, medal, 1682, his, other, major, works, from, this, period, are, the, religious, poems, religio, laici, 1682, written, from, the, position, of, a, member, of, the, church, of, england, his, 1683, edition, of, plutarch, s, lives, translated, from, the, greek, by, several, hands, in, which, he, introduced, the, word, biography, to, english, readers, and, the, hind, and, the, panther, 1687, which, celebrates, his, conversion, to, roman, catholicism, he, wrote, britannia, rediviva, celebrating, the, birth, of, a, son, and, heir, to, the, catholic, king, and, queen, on, 10, june, 1688, when, later, in, the, same, year, james, ii, was, deposed, in, the, glorious, revolution, dryden, s, refusal, to, take, the, oaths, of, allegiance, to, the, new, monarchs, william, and, mary, left, him, out, of, favour, at, court, thomas, shadwell, succeeded, him, as, poet, laureate, and, he, was, forced, to, give, up, his, public, offices, and, live, by, the, proceeds, of, his, pen, dryden, translated, works, by, horace, juvenal, ovid, lucretius, and, theocritus, a, task, which, he, found, far, more, satisfying, than, writing, for, the, stage, in, 1694, he, began, work, on, what, would, be, his, most, ambitious, and, defining, work, as, translator, the, works, of, virgil, 1697, which, was, published, by, subscription, the, publication, of, the, translation, of, virgil, was, a, national, event, and, brought, dryden, the, sum, of, 1, 400, dryden, translated, the, aeneid, into, couplets, turning, virgil, s, almost, 10, 000, lines, into, 13, 700, lines, joseph, addison, wrote, the, prose, prefaces, for, each, book, and, william, congreve, checked, the, translation, against, the, latin, original, his, final, translations, appeared, in, the, volume, fables, ancient, and, modern, 1700, a, series, of, episodes, from, homer, ovid, and, boccaccio, as, well, as, modernised, adaptations, from, geoffrey, chaucer, interspersed, with, dryden, s, own, poems, as, a, translator, he, made, great, literary, works, in, the, older, languages, available, to, readers, of, english, dryden, died, on, 12, may, 1700, and, was, initially, buried, in, st, anne, s, cemetery, in, soho, before, being, exhumed, and, reburied, in, westminster, abbey, ten, days, later, he, was, the, subject, of, poetic, eulogies, such, as, luctus, brittannici, or, the, tears, of, the, british, muses, for, the, death, of, john, dryden, esq, london, 1700, and, the, nine, muses, a, royal, society, of, arts, blue, plaque, commemorates, dryden, at, 43, gerrard, street, in, london, s, chinatown, he, lived, at, 137, long, acre, from, 1682, to, 1686, and, at, 43, gerrard, street, from, 1686, until, his, death, in, his, will, he, left, the, george, inn, at, northampton, to, trustees, to, form, a, school, for, the, children, of, the, poor, of, the, town, this, became, john, dryden, s, school, later, the, orange, school, dryden, was, the, dominant, literary, figure, and, influence, of, his, age, he, established, the, heroic, couplet, as, a, standard, form, of, english, poetry, by, writing, successful, satires, religious, pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and, plays, with, it, he, also, introduced, the, alexandrine, and, triplet, into, the, form, in, his, poems, translations, and, criticism, he, established, a, poetic, diction, appropriate, to, the, heroic, couplet, auden, referred, to, him, as, the, master, of, the, middle, style, that, was, a, model, for, his, contemporaries, and, for, much, of, the, 18th, century, the, considerable, loss, felt, by, the, english, literary, community, at, his, death, was, evident, in, the, elegies, written, about, him, dryden, s, heroic, couplet, became, the, dominant, poetic, form, of, the, 18th, century, alexander, pope, was, heavily, influenced, by, dryden, and, often, borrowed, from, him, other, writers, were, equally, influenced, by, dryden, and, pope, pope, famously, praised, dryden, s, versification, in, his, imitation, of, horace, s, epistle, ii, i, dryden, taught, to, join, the, varying, pause, the, full, resounding, line, the, long, majestic, march, and, energy, divine, samuel, johnson, summed, up, the, general, attitude, with, his, remark, that, the, veneration, with, which, his, name, is, pronounced, by, every, cultivator, of, english, literature, is, paid, to, him, as, he, refined, the, language, improved, the, sentiments, and, tuned, the, numbers, of, english, poetry, his, poems, were, very, widely, read, and, are, often, quoted, for, instance, in, henry, fielding, s, tom, jones, and, johnson, s, essays, johnson, also, noted, however, that, he, is, therefore, with, all, his, variety, of, excellence, not, often, pathetic, and, had, so, little, sensibility, of, the, power, of, effusions, purely, natural, that, he, did, not, esteem, them, in, others, simplicity, gave, him, no, pleasure, readers, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, did, not, mind, this, too, much, but, later, generations, considered, dryden, s, absence, of, sensibility, a, fault, one, of, the, first, attacks, on, dryden, s, reputation, was, by, william, wordsworth, who, complained, that, dryden, s, descriptions, of, natural, objects, in, his, translations, from, virgil, were, much, inferior, to, the, originals, however, several, of, wordsworth, s, contemporaries, such, as, george, crabbe, lord, byron, and, walter, scott, who, edited, dryden, s, works, were, still, keen, admirers, of, dryden, besides, wordsworth, did, admire, many, of, dryden, s, poems, and, his, famous, intimations, of, immortality, ode, owes, something, stylistically, to, dryden, s, alexander, s, feast, john, keats, admired, the, fables, and, imitated, them, in, his, poem, lamia, later, 19th, century, writers, had, little, use, for, verse, satire, pope, or, dryden, matthew, arnold, famously, dismissed, them, as, classics, of, our, prose, he, did, have, a, committed, admirer, in, george, saintsbury, and, was, a, prominent, figure, in, quotation, books, such, as, bartlett, s, but, the, next, major, poet, to, take, an, interest, in, dryden, was, t, s, eliot, who, wrote, that, he, was, the, ancestor, of, nearly, all, that, is, best, in, the, poetry, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, that, we, cannot, fully, enjoy, or, rightly, estimate, a, hundred, years, of, english, poetry, unless, we, fully, enjoy, dryden, however, in, the, same, essay, eliot, accused, dryden, of, having, a, commonplace, mind, critical, interest, in, dryden, has, increased, recently, but, as, a, relatively, straightforward, writer, william, empson, another, modern, admirer, of, dryden, compared, his, flat, use, of, language, with, donne, s, interest, in, the, echoes, and, recesses, of, words, his, work, has, not, occasioned, as, much, interest, as, andrew, marvell, s, john, donne, s, or, pope, s, dryden, is, believed, to, be, the, first, person, to, posit, that, english, sentences, should, not, end, in, prepositions, because, latin, sentences, cannot, end, in, prepositions, dryden, created, the, proscription, against, preposition, stranding, in, 1672, when, he, objected, to, ben, jonson, s, 1611, phrase, the, bodies, that, those, souls, were, frighted, from, though, he, did, not, provide, the, rationale, for, his, preference, dryden, often, translated, his, writing, into, latin, to, check, whether, his, writing, was, concise, and, elegant, latin, being, considered, an, elegant, and, long, lived, language, with, which, to, compare, then, dryden, translated, his, writing, back, to, english, according, to, latin, grammar, usage, as, latin, does, not, have, sentences, ending, in, prepositions, dryden, may, have, applied, latin, grammar, to, english, thus, forming, the, rule, of, no, sentence, ending, prepositions, subsequently, adopted, by, other, writers, the, phrase, blaze, of, glory, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, dryden, s, 1686, poem, the, hind, and, the, panther, referring, to, the, throne, of, god, as, a, blaze, of, glory, that, forbids, the, sight, what, dryden, achieved, in, his, poetry, was, neither, the, emotional, excitement, of, the, early, nineteenth, century, romantics, nor, the, intellectual, complexities, of, the, metaphysicals, his, subject, matter, was, often, factual, and, he, aimed, at, expressing, his, thoughts, in, the, most, precise, and, concentrated, manner, although, he, uses, formal, structures, such, as, heroic, couplets, he, tried, to, recreate, the, natural, rhythm, of, speech, and, he, knew, that, different, subjects, need, different, kinds, of, verse, in, his, preface, to, religio, laici, he, says, that, the, expressions, of, a, poem, designed, purely, for, instruction, ought, to, be, plain, and, natural, yet, majestic, the, florid, elevated, and, figurative, way, is, for, the, passions, for, these, are, begotten, in, the, soul, by, showing, the, objects, out, of, their, true, proportion, a, man, is, to, be, cheated, into, passion, but, to, be, reasoned, into, truth, while, dryden, had, many, admirers, he, also, had, his, share, of, critics, mark, van, doren, among, them, van, doren, complained, that, in, translating, virgil, s, aeneid, dryden, had, added, a, fund, of, phrases, with, which, he, could, expand, any, passage, that, seemed, to, him, curt, dryden, did, not, feel, such, expansion, was, a, fault, arguing, that, as, latin, is, a, naturally, concise, language, it, cannot, be, duly, represented, by, a, comparable, number, of, words, in, english, he, recognized, that, virgil, had, the, advantage, of, a, language, wherein, much, may, be, comprehended, in, a, little, space, 5, 329, 30, the, way, to, please, the, best, judges, is, not, to, translate, a, poet, literally, and, virgil, least, of, any, other, 5, 329, for, example, take, lines, 789, 795, of, book, 2, when, aeneas, sees, and, receives, a, message, from, the, ghost, of, his, wife, creusa, iamque, vale, et, nati, serva, communis, amorem, haec, ubi, dicta, dedit, lacrimantem, et, multa, volentem, dicere, deseruit, tenuisque, recessit, in, auras, ter, conatus, ibi, collo, dare, bracchia, circum, ter, frustra, comprensa, manus, effugit, imago, par, levibus, ventis, volucrique, simillima, somno, sic, demum, socios, consumpta, nocte, reviso, dryden, translates, it, like, this, i, trust, our, common, issue, to, your, care, she, said, and, gliding, pass, d, unseen, in, air, i, strove, to, speak, but, horror, tied, my, tongue, and, thrice, about, her, neck, my, arms, i, flung, and, thrice, deceiv, d, on, vain, embraces, hung, light, as, an, empty, dream, at, break, of, day, or, as, a, blast, of, wind, she, rush, d, away, thus, having, pass, d, the, night, in, fruitless, pain, i, to, my, longing, friends, return, again, dryden, s, translation, is, based, on, presumed, authorial, intent, and, smooth, english, in, line, 790, the, literal, translation, of, haec, ubi, dicta, dedit, is, when, she, gave, these, words, but, she, said, gets, the, point, across, uses, half, the, words, and, makes, for, better, english, a, few, lines, later, with, ter, conatus, ibi, collo, dare, bracchia, circum, ter, frustra, comprensa, manus, effugit, imago, he, alters, the, literal, translation, thrice, trying, to, give, arms, around, her, neck, thrice, the, image, grasped, in, vain, fled, the, hands, in, order, to, fit, it, into, the, metre, and, the, emotion, of, the, scene, in, his, own, words, the, way, i, have, taken, is, not, so, streight, as, metaphrase, nor, so, loose, as, paraphrase, some, things, too, i, have, omitted, and, sometimes, added, of, my, own, yet, the, omissions, i, hope, are, but, of, circumstances, and, such, as, wou, d, have, no, grace, in, english, and, the, addition, i, also, hope, are, easily, deduc, d, from, virgil, s, sense, they, will, seem, at, least, i, have, the, vanity, to, think, so, not, struck, into, him, but, growing, out, of, him, 5, 529, in, a, similar, vein, dryden, writes, in, his, preface, to, the, translation, anthology, sylvae, where, i, have, taken, away, some, of, expressions, and, cut, them, shorter, it, may, possibly, be, on, this, consideration, that, what, was, beautiful, in, the, greek, or, latin, would, not, appear, so, shining, in, the, english, and, where, i, have, enlarg, d, them, i, desire, the, false, criticks, would, not, always, think, that, those, thoughts, are, wholly, mine, but, that, either, they, are, secretly, in, the, poet, or, may, be, fairly, deduc, d, from, him, or, at, least, if, both, those, considerations, should, fail, that, my, own, is, of, a, piece, with, his, and, that, if, he, were, living, and, an, englishman, they, are, such, as, he, wou, d, probably, have, written, on, 1, december, 1663, dryden, married, lady, elizabeth, howard, died, 1714, at, st, swithin, s, london, and, the, consent, of, the, parents, is, noted, on, the, licence, although, lady, elizabeth, was, then, about, twenty, five, the, couple, met, after, 1660, when, dryden, began, lodging, in, london, with, her, brother, sir, robert, howard, son, of, the, earl, of, berkshire, the, marriage, lasted, until, his, death, but, there, is, little, evidence, about, how, they, lived, as, a, couple, a, small, estate, in, wiltshire, was, settled, upon, them, by, her, father, the, lady, s, intellect, and, temper, were, apparently, not, good, her, husband, was, treated, as, an, inferior, by, those, of, her, social, status, both, dryden, and, his, wife, were, warmly, attached, to, their, children, they, had, three, sons, charles, 1666, 1704, john, 1668, 1701, and, erasmus, henry, 1669, 1710, lady, elizabeth, dryden, survived, her, husband, but, reportedly, lost, her, wits, after, becoming, a, widow, although, some, have, historically, claimed, to, be, from, the, lineage, of, john, dryden, his, three, children, one, of, whom, became, a, roman, catholic, priest, had, no, children, themselves, dates, given, are, acted, published, and, unless, otherwise, noted, are, taken, from, scott, s,
