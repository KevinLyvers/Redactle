circumstances, as, his, father, was, well, educated, but, unable, to, secure, a, stable, profession, marat, credits, his, father, for, instilling, in, him, a, love, of, learning, he, explains, he, felt, exceptionally, fortunate, to, have, had, the, advantage, of, receiving, a, very, careful, education, in, my, paternal, home, from, his, mother, he, claims, to, have, been, taught, a, strong, sense, of, morality, and, social, conscience, marat, left, home, at, the, age, of, 16, desiring, to, seek, an, education, in, france, he, was, aware, of, the, limited, opportunities, for, those, seen,

and, studied, medicine, without, gaining, any, formal, qualifications, after, moving, to, france, jean, paul, mara, francized, his, surname, as, marat, he, worked, informally, as, a, doctor, after, moving, to, london, in, 1765, due, to, a, fear, of, being, drawn, into, dissipation, while, there, he, befriended, the, royal, academician, artist, angelica, kauffman, his, social, circle, included, italian, artists, and, architects, who, met, in, coffee, houses, around, soho, highly, ambitious, but, without, patronage, or, qualifications, he, set, about, inserting, himself, into, the, intellectual, scene, around, 1770, marat, moved, to, newcastle, upon, tyne, his, first, political, work, chains, of, slavery, 1774, inspired, by, the, extra, parliamentary, activities, of, the, disenfranchised, mp, and, later, mayor, of, london, john, wilkes, was, most, probably, compiled, in, the, central, library, there, by, marat, s, own, account, while, composing, it, he, lived, on, black, coffee, for, three, months, and, slept, two, hours, a, night, and, after, finishing, it, he, slept, soundly, for, 13, days, in, a, row, he, gave, it, the, subtitle, a, work, in, which, the, clandestine, and, villainous, attempts, of, princes, to, ruin, liberty, are, pointed, out, and, the, dreadful, scenes, of, despotism, disclosed, in, the, work, marat, criticized, aspects, of, england, s, constitution, that, he, believed, to, be, corrupt, or, despotic, he, condemned, the, king, s, power, to, influence, parliament, through, bribery, and, attacked, limitations, on, voting, rights, chains, of, slavery, s, political, ideology, takes, clear, inspiration, from, jean, jacques, rousseau, by, attributing, the, nation, s, sovereignty, to, the, common, people, rather, than, a, monarch, he, also, suggests, that, the, people, express, sovereignty, through, representatives, who, cannot, enact, legislation, without, the, approval, of, the, people, they, represent, this, work, earned, him, honorary, membership, of, the, patriotic, societies, of, berwick, upon, tweed, carlisle, and, newcastle, the, newcastle, literary, and, philosophical, society, library, possesses, a, copy, and, tyne, and, wear, archives, service, holds, three, presented, to, the, various, newcastle, guilds, marat, published, a, philosophical, essay, on, man, in, 1773, and, chains, of, slavery, in, 1774, voltaire, s, sharp, critique, of, de, l, homme, an, augmented, translation, published, 1775, 76, partly, in, defence, of, his, prot, g, helv, tius, reinforced, marat, s, growing, sense, of, a, widening, gulf, between, the, philosophes, grouped, around, voltaire, on, one, hand, and, their, opponents, loosely, grouped, around, rousseau, on, the, other, after, a, published, essay, on, curing, a, friend, of, gleets, gonorrhoea, he, secured, medical, referees, for, an, md, from, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, june, 1775, he, published, enquiry, into, the, nature, cause, and, cure, of, a, singular, disease, of, the, eyes, on, his, return, to, london, in, 1776, marat, moved, to, paris, after, stopping, in, geneva, to, visit, his, family, in, paris, his, growing, reputation, as, a, highly, effective, doctor, along, with, the, patronage, of, the, marquis, de, l, aubespine, the, husband, of, one, of, his, patients, secured, his, appointment, as, physician, to, the, bodyguard, of, the, comte, d, artois, louis, xvi, s, youngest, brother, who, was, to, become, king, charles, x, in, 1824, he, began, this, position, in, june, 1777, the, position, paid, 2, 000, livres, a, year, plus, allowances, marat, set, up, a, laboratory, in, the, marquise, de, l, aubespine, s, house, with, funds, obtained, by, serving, as, court, doctor, among, the, aristocracy, his, method, was, to, describe, in, detail, the, meticulous, series, of, experiments, he, had, undertaken, on, a, problem, seeking, to, explore, and, then, exclude, all, possible, conclusions, but, the, one, he, reached, he, published, works, on, fire, and, heat, electricity, and, light, he, published, a, summary, of, his, scientific, views, and, discoveries, in, d, couvertes, de, m, marat, sur, le, feu, l, lectricit, et, la, lumi, re, english, mr, marat, s, discoveries, on, fire, electricity, and, light, in, 1779, he, published, three, more, detailed, and, extensive, works, that, expanded, on, each, of, his, areas, of, research, the, first, of, marat, s, large, scale, publications, detailing, his, experiments, and, drawing, conclusions, from, them, was, recherches, physiques, sur, le, feu, english, research, into, the, physics, of, fire, which, was, published, in, 1780, with, the, approval, of, the, official, censors, this, publication, describes, 166, experiments, conducted, to, demonstrate, that, fire, was, not, as, was, widely, held, a, material, element, but, an, igneous, fluid, he, asked, the, academy, of, sciences, to, appraise, his, work, and, it, appointed, a, commission, to, do, so, which, reported, in, april, 1779, the, report, avoided, endorsing, marat, s, conclusions, but, praised, his, new, precise, and, well, executed, experiments, appropriately, and, ingeniously, designed, marat, then, published, his, work, with, the, claim, that, the, academy, approved, of, its, contents, since, the, academy, had, endorsed, his, methods, but, said, nothing, about, his, conclusions, this, claim, drew, the, ire, of, antoine, lavoisier, who, demanded, that, the, academy, repudiate, it, when, the, academy, did, so, this, marked, the, beginning, of, worsening, relations, between, marat, and, many, of, its, leading, members, a, number, of, them, including, lavoisier, himself, as, well, as, condorcet, and, laplace, took, a, strong, dislike, to, marat, however, lamarck, and, lac, p, de, wrote, positively, about, marat, s, experiments, and, conclusions, in, marat, s, time, newton, s, views, on, light, and, colour, were, regarded, almost, universally, as, definitive, yet, marat, s, explicit, purpose, in, his, second, major, work, d, couvertes, sur, la, lumi, re, discoveries, on, light, was, to, demonstrate, that, in, certain, key, areas, newton, was, wrong, the, focus, of, marat, s, work, was, the, study, of, how, light, bends, around, objects, and, his, main, argument, was, that, while, newton, held, that, white, light, was, broken, down, into, colours, by, refraction, the, colours, were, actually, caused, by, diffraction, when, a, beam, of, sunlight, shone, through, an, aperture, passed, through, a, prism, and, projected, colour, onto, a, wall, the, splitting, of, the, light, into, colours, took, place, not, in, the, prism, as, newton, maintained, but, at, the, edges, of, the, aperture, itself, marat, sought, to, demonstrate, that, there, are, only, three, primary, colours, rather, than, seven, as, newton, had, argued, once, again, marat, requested, the, academy, of, sciences, review, his, work, and, it, set, up, a, commission, to, do, so, over, a, period, of, seven, months, from, june, 1779, to, january, 1780, marat, performed, his, experiments, in, the, presence, of, the, commissioners, so, that, they, could, appraise, his, methods, and, conclusions, the, drafting, of, their, final, report, was, assigned, to, jean, baptiste, le, roy, the, report, was, finally, produced, after, many, delays, in, may, 1780, and, consisted, of, just, three, short, paragraphs, significantly, the, report, concluded, that, these, experiments, are, so, very, numerous, they, do, not, appear, to, us, to, prove, what, the, author, believes, they, establish, the, academy, declined, to, endorse, marat, s, work, when, it, was, published, d, couvertes, sur, la, lumi, re, did, not, carry, the, royal, approbation, according, to, the, title, page, it, was, printed, in, london, so, that, either, marat, could, not, get, the, official, censor, to, approve, it, or, he, did, not, want, to, spend, the, time, and, effort, to, do, so, marat, s, third, major, work, recherches, physiques, sur, l, lectricit, english, research, on, the, physics, of, electricity, outlined, 214, experiments, one, of, his, major, areas, of, interest, was, in, electrical, attraction, and, repulsion, repulsion, he, held, was, not, a, basic, force, of, nature, he, addressed, a, number, of, other, areas, of, enquiry, in, his, work, concluding, with, a, section, on, lightning, rods, which, argued, that, those, with, pointed, ends, were, more, effective, than, those, with, blunt, ends, and, denouncing, the, idea, of, earthquake, rods, advocated, by, pierre, bertholon, de, saint, lazare, this, book, was, published, with, the, censor, s, stamp, of, approval, but, marat, did, not, seek, the, endorsement, of, the, academy, of, sciences, in, april, 1783, he, resigned, his, court, appointment, and, devoted, his, energies, full, time, to, scientific, research, apart, from, his, major, works, during, this, period, marat, published, shorter, essays, on, the, medical, use, of, electricity, m, moire, sur, l, lectricit, m, dicale, 1783, and, on, optics, notions, l, mentaires, d, optique, 1784, he, published, a, well, received, translation, of, newton, s, opticks, 1787, which, was, still, in, print, until, recently, and, later, a, collection, of, essays, on, his, experimental, findings, including, a, study, on, the, effect, of, light, on, soap, bubbles, in, his, m, moires, acad, miques, ou, nouvelles, d, couvertes, sur, la, lumi, re, academic, memoirs, or, new, discoveries, on, light, 1788, benjamin, franklin, visited, him, on, several, occasions, and, goethe, described, his, rejection, by, the, academy, as, a, glaring, example, of, scientific, despotism, in, 1780, marat, published, his, favourite, work, a, plan, de, l, gislation, criminelle, it, was, a, polemic, for, penal, reform, which, had, been, entered, into, a, competition, announced, by, the, berne, economic, society, in, february, 1777, and, backed, by, frederick, the, great, and, voltaire, marat, was, inspired, by, rousseau, and, cesare, beccaria, s, il, libro, dei, delitti, e, delle, pene, marat, s, entry, contained, many, radical, ideas, including, the, argument, that, society, should, provide, fundamental, natural, needs, such, as, food, and, shelter, if, it, expected, all, its, citizens, to, follow, its, civil, laws, that, the, king, was, no, more, than, the, first, magistrate, of, his, people, that, there, should, be, a, common, death, penalty, regardless, of, class, and, that, each, town, should, have, a, dedicated, avocat, des, pauvres, and, set, up, independent, criminal, tribunals, with, twelve, man, juries, to, ensure, a, fair, trial, in, 1788, the, assembly, of, notables, advised, louis, xvi, to, assemble, the, estates, general, for, the, first, time, in, 175, years, according, to, marat, in, the, latter, half, of, 1788, he, had, been, deathly, ill, upon, hearing, of, the, king, s, decision, to, call, together, the, estates, general, however, he, explains, that, the, news, had, a, powerful, effect, on, me, my, illness, suddenly, broke, and, my, spirits, revived, he, strongly, desired, to, contribute, his, ideas, to, the, coming, events, and, subsequently, abandoned, his, career, as, a, scientist, and, doctor, taking, up, his, pen, on, behalf, of, the, third, estate, marat, anonymously, published, his, first, contribution, to, the, revolution, in, february, 1789, titled, offrande, la, patrie, offering, to, the, nation, which, touched, on, some, of, the, same, points, as, the, abb, siey, s, famous, qu, est, ce, que, le, tiers, tat, what, is, the, third, estate, marat, claimed, that, this, work, caused, a, sensation, throughout, france, though, he, likely, exaggerated, its, effect, as, the, pamphlet, mostly, echoed, ideas, similar, to, many, other, pamphlets, and, cahiers, circulating, at, the, time, this, was, followed, by, a, suppl, ment, de, l, offrande, in, march, where, he, was, less, optimistic, expressing, displeasure, with, the, king, s, lettres, royales, of, 24, january, in, august, 1789, he, published, la, constitution, ou, projet, de, d, claration, des, droits, de, l, homme, et, du, citoyen, intended, to, influence, the, drafting, of, france, s, new, constitution, then, being, debated, in, the, national, assembly, in, this, work, he, builds, his, theories, upon, ideas, taken, from, montesquieu, and, rousseau, claiming, that, the, sovereignty, of, the, nation, rests, with, the, people, and, emphasizing, the, need, for, a, separation, of, powers, he, argues, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, believing, that, a, republic, is, ineffective, in, large, nations, marat, s, work, elicited, no, response, from, the, national, assembly, on, 14, july, three, days, after, louis, xvi, dismissed, jacques, necker, as, his, financial, advisor, enraged, parisians, attacked, the, hotel, des, invalides, and, the, bastille, marking, the, first, insurrection, of, the, french, revolution, marat, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, fall, of, the, bastille, but, sought, to, glorify, his, role, that, day, by, claiming, that, he, had, intercepted, a, group, of, german, soldiers, on, pont, neuf, he, claims, that, these, soldiers, were, seeking, to, crush, the, revolution, in, its, infancy, and, that, he, had, successfully, convinced, a, crowd, to, force, the, soldiers, to, surrender, their, weapons, whether, or, not, this, event, actually, occurred, is, questionable, as, there, are, no, other, known, accounts, that, confirm, marat, s, story, on, 12, september, 1789, marat, began, his, own, newspaper, entitled, publiciste, parisien, before, changing, its, name, four, days, later, to, l, ami, du, peuple, the, people, s, friend, 19, from, this, position, he, often, attacked, the, most, influential, and, powerful, groups, in, paris, as, conspirators, against, the, revolution, including, the, commune, the, constituent, assembly, the, ministers, and, the, ch, telet, in, january, 1790, he, moved, to, the, radical, cordeliers, section, then, under, the, leadership, of, the, lawyer, danton, was, nearly, arrested, for, his, attacks, against, jacques, necker, louis, xvi, s, popular, finance, minister, and, was, forced, to, flee, to, london, in, may, he, returned, to, paris, to, continue, publication, of, l, ami, du, peuple, and, briefly, ran, a, second, newspaper, in, june, 1790, called, le, junius, fran, ais, named, after, the, notorious, english, polemicist, junius, 73, 76, marat, faced, the, problem, of, counterfeiters, distributing, falsified, versions, of, l, ami, du, peuple, this, led, him, to, call, for, police, intervention, which, resulted, in, the, suppression, of, the, fraudulent, issues, leaving, marat, the, continuing, sole, author, of, l, ami, du, peuple, 122, during, this, period, marat, made, regular, attacks, on, the, more, conservative, revolutionary, leaders, in, a, pamphlet, from, 26, july, 1790, entitled, c, en, est, fait, de, nous, we, re, done, for, he, warned, against, counter, revolutionaries, advising, five, or, six, hundred, heads, cut, off, would, have, assured, your, repose, freedom, and, happiness, between, 1789, and, 1792, marat, was, often, forced, into, hiding, sometimes, in, the, paris, sewers, where, he, almost, certainly, aggravated, his, debilitating, chronic, skin, disease, possibly, dermatitis, herpetiformis, in, january, 1792, he, married, the, 26, year, old, simonne, vrard, in, a, common, law, ceremony, on, his, return, from, exile, in, london, having, previously, expressed, his, love, for, her, she, was, the, sister, in, law, of, his, typographer, jean, antoine, corne, and, had, lent, him, money, and, sheltered, him, on, several, occasions, marat, only, emerged, publicly, on, the, 10, august, insurrection, when, the, tuileries, palace, was, invaded, and, the, royal, family, forced, to, shelter, within, the, legislative, assembly, the, spark, for, this, uprising, was, the, brunswick, manifesto, which, called, for, the, crushing, of, the, revolution, and, helped, to, inflame, popular, outrage, in, paris, 206, as, the, paris, commune, of, marat, s, allies, achieved, more, influence, it, formed, a, committee, on, surveillance, which, included, marat, jacque, nicolas, billaud, varennes, jean, marie, collot, d, herbois, georges, danton, jean, lambert, tallien, panis, fr, and, david, marat, was, said, by, stanley, loomis, to, have, claimed, the, position, of, its, head, ernest, belfort, bax, disputed, this, claim, saying, that, on, appearing, once, again, in, the, upper, daylight, of, paris, marat, was, almost, immediately, invited, to, assist, the, new, governing, body, with, his, advice, and, had, a, special, tribune, assigned, to, him, marat, was, thus, assiduous, in, his, attendance, at, the, commune, although, never, formally, a, member, the, commune, and, the, sections, of, paris, between, them, had, established, a, comit, de, surveillance, with, power, to, add, to, its, numbers, into, this, committee, marat, was, according, to, bax, co, opted, they, quickly, decided, to, round, up, those, they, believed, were, suspect, the, committee, voted, to, do, so, and, four, thousand, were, sent, into, the, prisons, by, late, august, 1792, actually, the, committee, of, which, marat, was, one, of, the, most, influential, members, took, the, step, of, withdrawing, from, the, prisons, those, of, whose, guilt, in, its, opinion, there, was, any, reasonable, doubt, marat, and, the, rest, saw, what, was, coming, the, last, straw, to, break, the, patience, of, paris, was, the, acquittal, on, friday, 31, august, of, montmarin, the, late, governor, of, fontainebleau, montmarin, was, notoriously, and, openly, a, courtier, who, wished, to, see, the, allies, in, paris, and, his, royal, master, reinstated, and, who, was, proved, beyond, the, shadow, of, a, doubt, to, have, been, actively, engaged, in, plotting, to, this, end, yet, on, being, brought, to, trial, he, was, acquitted, and, as, if, to, lend, emphasis, to, the, acquittal, the, judge, himself, descending, from, the, bench, gave, him, his, arm, as, he, walked, out, of, court, an, unsuccessful, attempt, was, even, made, to, deprive, the, commune, of, its, powers, forty, eight, hours, later, the, notorious, september, massacres, began, those, arrangements, would, include, a, collection, of, mercenaries, grouped, as, marsellais, though, they, were, foreign, vagabonds, dregs, of, all, nations, genosee, corsicans, and, greeks, led, by, a, pole, named, lazowski, added, to, these, were, convicted, murderers, and, those, imprisoned, for, other, violent, crimes, released, in, time, to, join, the, marsellais, at, the, center, of, the, bloodlettings, at, times, those, enacting, violence, were, joined, by, mobs, of, locals, some, of, who, had, armed, themselves, in, preparation, for, a, defense, of, the, city, national, guardsmen, and, some, f, d, r, s, in, some, cases, makeshift, courts, were, set, up, prisoners, were, pronounced, free, or, guilty, then, all, were, led, to, a, central, courtyard, where, they, were, bludgeoned, hacked, speared, and, decapitated, in, other, prisons, small, bands, of, mercenaries, entered, cells, which, had, held, murderers, days, before, who, turned, their, craft, on, the, innocents, brought, in, by, the, committee, some, as, young, as, 10, on, 3, september, the, second, day, of, the, massacres, the, committee, of, surveillance, of, the, commune, published, a, circular, that, called, on, provincial, patriots, to, defend, paris, and, asked, that, before, leaving, their, homes, they, eliminate, counter, revolutionaries, authored, by, marat, as, head, of, the, committee, signed, by, him, and, circulated, to, the, provinces, it, hailed, the, rounding, up, and, killing, of, political, enemies, going, on, in, paris, as, a, model, for, the, provinces, while, georges, lefebvre, maintained, collective, mentality, was, sufficient, explanation, for, the, mass, killing, stanley, loomis, says, this, is, their, excuse, or, justification, the, girondins, then, made, a, number, of, copies, of, this, circular, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, had, any, effect, marat, himself, did, not, participate, in, the, violence, of, the, massacres, but, rather, the, sections, of, paris, had, begun, to, act, of, themselves, marat, and, his, committee, of, supervision, at, most, took, the, control, of, the, movement, which, had, already, begun, spontaneously, whether, marat, played, a, part, in, the, cause, of, the, massacres, is, still, continually, debated, it, can, be, said, that, there, was, a, continuous, goading, on, of, the, tribunals, to, definite, and, decided, action, in, no, 679, of, l, ami, du, peuple, we, have, the, following, advice, guard, the, king, from, view, put, a, price, on, the, heads, of, the, fugitive, capets, arm, all, the, citizens, form, a, camp, near,

line, to, name, their, officers, guard, the, provisions, do, not, miss, a, word, of, this, last, advice, press, the, judgment, of, the, traitors, imprisoned, in, the, abbaye, if, the, sword, of, justice, do, at, last, but, strike, conspirators, and, prevaricators, we, shall, no, longer, hear, popular, executions, spoken, of, cruel, resource, which, the, law, of, necessity, can, alone, commend, to, a, people, reduced, to, despair, but, which, the, voluntary, sleep, of, the, laws, always, justifies, danton, at, the, same, moment, was, urging, from, the, tribune, the, necessity, of, the, prompt, appointment, of, a, court, to, try, traitors, as, the, only, alternative, to, the, popular, justice, of, the, streets, maximilien, robespierre, danton, and, marat, all, stressed, the, necessity, of, a, tribunal, that, would, judge, these, crimes, robespierre, intervened, on, 15, august, as, a, delegate, of, the, commune, and, proclaimed, since, 10, august, the, just, vengeance, of, the, people, has, not, yet, been, satisfied, according, to, bax, the, september, massacres, were, the, result, of, the, efforts, of, the, moderate, party, to, screen, men, who, were, openly, plotting, the, overthrow, of, the, revolution, the, moderatist, and, girondist, assembly, hesitated, at, making, a, few, examples, of, even, the, most, notorious, of, these, plotters, the, crisis, in, the, war, long, foreseen, by, marat, and, others, was, now, becoming, more, acute, every, day, on, 6, september, mlle, de, mareuil, daughter, of, a, member, of, the, commune, s, general, council, wrote, to, her, brother, i, have, to, make, the, following, remark, since, the, journ, e, of, 10, august, there, have, only, been, three, people, guillotined, and, this, has, revolted, the, people, finally, people, gathered, from, all, sides, oh, my, dear, friend, we, are, all, in, a, state, of, dreadful, consternation, there, is, an, exculpatory, article, in, no, 12, of, marat, s, journal, de, la, r, publique, occasioned, by, the, virulent, attacks, of, the, girondins, in, the, convention, on, the, commune, the, committee, of, supervision, and, above, all, on, marat, himself, with, reference, to, the, massacres, the, disastrous, events, of, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, of, september, which, perfidious, and, venal, persons, attribute, to, the, municipality, has, been, solely, promoted, by, the, denial, of, justice, on, the, part, of, the, criminal, tribunal, which, whitewashed, the, conspirator, montmarin, by, the, protection, thus, proclaimed, to, all, others, conspirators, and, by, the, indignation, of, the, people, fearing, to, find, itself, the, slave, of, all, the, traitors, who, have, for, so, long, abused, its, misfortunes, and, its, disasters, they, call, those, brigands, who, massacred, the, traitors, and, scoundrels, confined, in, the, prisons, if, that, were, so, p, tion, would, be, criminal, for, having, peaceably, left, brigands, to, perpetrate, their, crimes, during, two, consecutive, days, in, all, the, prisons, of, paris, his, culpable, inaction, would, be, the, most, serious, crime, and, he, would, merit, the, loss, of, his, head, for, not, having, mobilised, his, whole, armed, force, to, oppose, them, he, will, doubtless, tell, you, in, order, to, exculpate, himself, that, the, armed, force, would, not, have, obeyed, him, and, that, all, paris, was, involved, which, is, indeed, a, fact, let, us, agree, then, that, it, is, an, imposture, to, make, brigands, responsible, for, an, operation, unhappily, only, too, necessary, it, is, then, because, the, conspirators, have, escaped, the, sword, of, justice, that, they, have, fallen, under, the, axe, of, the, people, is, it, necessary, to, say, more, to, refute, the, dishonest, insinuation, which, would, make, the, committee, of, supervision, of, the, commune, responsible, for, these, popular, executions, but, its, justification, does, not, end, there, we, shall, see, what, the, principal, members, of, this, committee, have, done, to, prevent, any, innocent, person, any, debtor, any, one, culpable, of, a, trivial, offence, being, involved, in, the, dangers, which, threatened, great, criminals, i, was, at, the, committee, of, supervision, when, the, announcement, was, made, that, the, people, had, just, seized, from, the, hands, of, the, guard, and, put, to, death, several, refractory, priests, accused, of, plotting, destined, by, the, committee, for, la, force, and, that, the, people, threatened, to, enter, the, prisons, at, this, news, panis, and, myself, exclaimed, together, as, if, by, inspiration, save, the, small, delinquents, the, poor, debtors, those, accused, of, trivial, assaults, the, committee, immediately, ordered, the, different, jailers, to, separate, these, from, the, serious, malefactors, and, the, counter, revolutionary, traitors, lest, the, people, should, be, exposed, to, the, risk, of, sacrificing, some, innocent, persons, the, separation, was, already, made, when, the, prisons, were, forced, but, the, precaution, was, unnecessary, owing, to, the, care, taken, by, the, judges, appointed, by, the, people, who, exercised, the, functions, of, tribunes, during, the, expedition, to, inquire, into, each, case, and, to, release, all, those, whom, the, committee, of, supervision, had, separated, this, is, a, discrimination, the, despot, would, certainly, not, have, exercised, had, he, triumphed, on, the, 10th, of, august, such, are, the, facts, which, oppose, themselves, to, the, calumny, that, has, distorted, the, narrative, of, the, events, of, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, of, september, the, september, massacres, were, not, the, work, of, one, party, much, less, of, one, man, but, an, ebullition, of, popular, fury, acquiesced, in, as, a, necessity, by, all, parties, and, by, all, the, leading, men, of, the, revolution, this, perspective, of, affairs, is, summed, up, in, the, passages, of, mr, bowen, graves, quoted, by, ernest, belfort, bax, marat, s, part, in, these, last, terrible, events, has, been, constantly, and, grossly, misrepresented, he, had, long, foreseen, and, foretold, what, would, happen, if, foreign, invasion, found, paris, in, a, state, of, chaos, the, predicted, crisis, had, now, arrived, on, the, east, the, germans, are, at, the, thermopylae, of, france, a, step, more, the, revolution, sinks, beneath, them, on, the, west, the, standard, of, the, vendean, insurrection, is, already, raised, between, the, two, lies, paris, in, hardly, dormant, civil, war, royalty, is, overthrown, but, royalism, is, rampant, the, swiss, guards, the, rank, and, file, have, fallen, sacrificed, to, their, fidelity, to, a, master, who, had, deserted, and, forgotten, them, but, officers, courtiers, chevaliers, de, poignard, are, lively, as, ever, intriguing, plotting, vapouring, in, street, and, caf, openly, rejoicing, in, the, triumph, which, german, armies, will, give, them, measuring, compasses, in, hand, the, distance, between, verdun, and, paris, the, newly, formed, tribunal, is, inefficient, acquitting, men, notorious, for, their, part, in, the, intrigues, which, were, the, cause, of, all, the, evil, lafayette, with, his, army, is, believed, to, be, marching, on, paris, to, restore, the, monarchy, republicans, knew, well, enough, what, such, restoration, would, mean, the, horrors, of, montauban, arles, and, avignon, are, written, in, history, to, show, how, well, founded, were, their, fears, and, in, the, midst, of, all, this, came, the, tidings, that, the, one, strong, place, between, paris, and, the, enemy, is, besieged, that, its, resistance, is, a, question, hardly, even, of, days, then, while, the, tocsin, was, clanging, and, the, alarm, cannon, roaring, and, the, girondin, minister, could, find, nothing, better, to, suggest, with, his, unseasonable, classicism, than, carrying, into, the, south, the, statue, of, liberty, paris, answered, with, one, instinct, to, danton, s, thundering, defiance, and, perpetrated, that, tremendous, act, of, self, defence, at, which, we, shudder, to, this, day, the, reaction, hid, its, head, and, cowered, and, within, the, month, the, ragged, volunteers, of, the, republic, were, hurling, back, from, the, passes, of, the, argonne, the, finest, soldiery, which, europe, could, produce, on, 2, september, news, arrived, in, paris, that, the, army, of, the, duke, of, braunschweig, had, invaded, france, and, the, fortress, of, verdun, had, quickly, fallen, and, that, the, prussians, were, rapidly, advancing, towards, the, capital, this, information, ignited, anger, and, fear, among, the, population, parisians, knew, that, an, illumination, had, been, staged, at, the, abbay, prison, on, the, day, of, the, capture, of, longwy, where, behind, bars, the, prisoners, insulted, passers, by, and, assured, them, that, the, prussians, would, occupy, paris, and, destroy, it, that, the, parisians, hatred, of, the, royalists, was, founded, can, be, deduced, from, an, article, published, in, a, girondist, newspaper, on, 2, september, stating, that, the, royalists, decided, to, burn, the, city, on, all, sides, after, the, prussian, army, entered, paris, starved, the, city, population, and, punished, the, revolutionaries, and, the, manifesto, of, the, duke, of, braunschweig, 25, july, 1792, written, in, large, part, by, louis, xvi, s, cousin, louis, joseph, de, bourbon, prince, of, cond, leader, of, a, large, contingent, of, immigrants, in, the, allied, army, threatened, the, french, people, with, instant, punishment, if, the, people, resists, the, imperial, and, prussian, armies, and, the, re, establishment, of, a, monarchy, the, days, of, september, in, paris, were, seen, by, some, as, the, act, of, self, defense, of, a, people, who, knew, how, brutal, the, counter, revolutionaries, were, a, people, who, feared, a, coup, in, paris, while, fighting, on, the, front, lines, after, the, capture, of, verdun, the, prussian, army, was, only, a, hundred, miles, from, paris, many, europeans, had, no, doubt, about, the, victory, of, the, duke, of, braunschweig, a, fall, of, paris, was, not, expected, later, than, 10, september, in, the, cr, ole, patriote, for, 2, september, the, account, began, by, evoking, 10, august, the, people, justly, indignant, at, the, crimes, committed, during, the, journ, e, of, 10, august, made, for, the, prisons, they, still, feared, plots, and, traitors, the, news, that, verdun, had, been, taken, provoked, their, resentment, and, vengeance, it, was, enough, for, the, legislative, assembly, at, the, vigorous, request, of, the, commune, to, issue, a, statement, to, the, french, people, on, 4, september, in, which, it, promised, that, it, would, fight, with, all, its, powers, against, the, king, and, the, royal, government, so, that, the, slaughter, would, end, the, same, day, and, parisians, would, go, to, the, front, the, battle, of, valmy, 20, september, 1792, was, the, first, victory, over, their, enemy, since, the, beginning, of, the, war, johann, wolfgang, van, goethe, an, admirer, of, the, scientific, work, of, dr, marat, said, at, that, place, on, that, day, a, new, era, in, world, history, began, it, is, the, first, victory, of, the, people, over, the, kings, no, one, was, prosecuted, for, the, killings, marat, was, elected, to, the, national, convention, in, september, 1792, as, one, of, 26, paris, deputies, although, he, belonged, to, no, party, when, france, was, declared, a, republic, on, 22, september, marat, renamed, his, l, ami, du, peuple, as, le, journal, de, la, r, publique, fran, aise, journal, of, the, french, republic, his, stance, during, the, trial, of, the, deposed, king, louis, xvi, was, unique, he, declared, it, unfair, to, accuse, louis, of, anything, before, his, acceptance, of, the, french, constitution, of, 1791, and, although, implacably, he, said, believing, that, the, monarch, s, death, would, be, good, for, the, people, defended, guillaume, chr, tien, de, lamoignon, de, malesherbes, the, king, s, counsel, as, a, sage, et, respectable, vieillard, wise, and, respected, old, man, on, 21, january, 1793, louis, xvi, was, guillotined, which, caused, political, turmoil, from, january, to, may, marat, fought, bitterly, against, the, girondins, whom, he, believed, to, be, covert, enemies, of, republicanism, marat, s, hatred, and, suspicion, of, the, girondins, became, increasingly, heated, which, led, him, to, call, for, the, use, of, violent, tactics, against, them, he, cried, that, france, needed, a, chief, a, military, tribune, the, girondins, fought, back, and, demanded, that, marat, be, tried, before, the, revolutionary, tribunal, after, trying, to, avoid, arrest, for, several, days, marat, was, finally, imprisoned, on, 24, april, he, was, brought, before, the, tribunal, on, the, charges, that, he, had, printed, in, his, paper, statements, calling, for, widespread, murder, as, well, as, the, suspension, of, the, convention, marat, decisively, defended, his, actions, stating, that, he, had, no, evil, intentions, directed, against, the, convention, marat, was, acquitted, of, all, charges, to, the, celebration, of, his, supporters, the, fall, of, the, girondins, on, 2, june, helped, by, the, actions, of, fran, ois, hanriot, the, new, leader, of, the, national, guard, was, one, of, marat, s, last, achievements, forced, to, retire, from, the, convention, due, to, his, worsening, skin, disease, he, continued, to, work, from, home, where, he, soaked, in, a, medicinal, bath, now, that, the, montagnards, no, longer, needed, his, support, in, the, struggle, against, the, girondins, robespierre, and, other, leading, montagnards, began, to, separate, themselves, from, him, while, the, convention, largely, ignored, his, letters, marat, was, in, his, bathtub, on, 13, july, when, a, young, woman, from, caen, charlotte, corday, appeared, at, his, flat, claiming, to, have, vital, information, on, the, activities, of, the, escaped, girondins, who, had, fled, to, normandy, despite, his, wife, simone, s, protests, marat, asked, for, her, to, enter, and, gave, her, an, audience, by, his, bath, over, which, a, board, had, been, laid, to, serve, as, a, writing, desk, their, interview, lasted, around, fifteen, minutes, he, asked, her, what, was, happening, in, caen, and, she, explained, reciting, a, list, of, the, offending, deputies, after, he, had, finished, writing, out, the, list, corday, claimed, that, he, told, her, their, heads, will, fall, within, a, fortnight, a, statement, she, later, changed, at, her, trial, to, soon, i, shall, have, them, all, guillotined, in, paris, this, was, unlikely, since, marat, did, not, have, the, power, to, have, anyone, guillotined, at, that, moment, corday, rose, from, her, chair, drawing, out, from, her, corset, a, five, inch, 13, cm, kitchen, knife, which, she, had, bought, earlier, that, day, and, brought, it, down, into, marat, s, chest, where, it, pierced, just, under, his, right, clavicle, opening, the, brachiocephalic, artery, close, to, the, heart, the, massive, bleeding, was, fatal, within, seconds, slumping, backwards, marat, cried, out, his, last, words, to, simone, aidez, moi, ma, ch, re, amie, help, me, my, beloved, and, died, corday, was, a, girondin, sympathizer, who, came, from, an, impoverished, royalist, family, her, brothers, were, migr, s, who, had, left, to, join, the, exiled, royal, princes, from, her, own, account, and, those, of, witnesses, it, is, clear, that, she, had, been, inspired, by, girondin, speeches, to, a, hatred, of, the, montagnards, and, their, excesses, symbolised, most, powerfully, in, the, character, of, marat, the, book, of, days, claims, the, motive, was, to, avenge, the, death, of, her, friend, barboroux, marat, s, assassination, contributed, to, the, mounting, suspicion, which, fed, the, terror, during, which, thousands, of, the, jacobins, adversaries, both, royalists, and, girondins, were, executed, on, charges, of, treason, charlotte, corday, was, guillotined, on, 17, july, 1793, for, the, murder, during, her, four, day, trial, she, testified, that, she, had, carried, out, the, assassination, alone, saying, i, killed, one, man, to, save, 100, 000, marat, s, assassination, led, to, his, apotheosis, the, painter, jacques, louis, david, a, member, of, one, of, the, two, great, committees, the, committee, of, general, security, was, asked, to, organise, a, grand, funeral, david, was, also, asked, to, paint, marat, s, death, and, took, up, the, task, of, immortalising, him, in, the, painting, the, death, of, marat, the, extreme, decomposition, of, marat, s, body, made, any, realistic, depiction, impossible, and, david, s, work, beautified, the, skin, that, was, discoloured, and, scabbed, from, his, chronic, skin, disease, in, an, attempt, to, create, antique, virtue, the, resulting, painting, is, thus, not, an, accurate, representation, of, marat, s, death, as, a, result, of, this, work, david, was, later, criticised, as, glorifying, the, jacobin, s, death, the, entire, national, convention, attended, marat, s, funeral, and, he, was, buried, under, a, weeping, willow, in, the, garden, of, the, former, club, des, cordeliers, former, couvent, des, cordeliers, after, marat, s, death, he, was, viewed, by, many, as, a, martyr, for, the, revolution, and, was, immortalized, in, various, ways, to, preserve, the, values, he, stood, for, his, heart, was, embalmed, separately, and, placed, in, an, urn, in, an, altar, erected, to, his, memory, at, the, cordeliers, to, inspire, speeches, that, were, similar, in, style, to, marat, s, journalism, on, his, tomb, the, inscription, on, a, plaque, read, unit, indivisibilit, de, la, r, publique, libert, galit, fraternit, ou, la, mort, his, remains, were, transferred, to, the, panth, on, on, 21, september, 1794, and, his, near, messianic, role, in, the, revolution, was, confirmed, with, the, elegy, like, jesus, marat, loved, ardently, the, people, and, only, them, like, jesus, marat, hated, kings, nobles, priests, rogues, and, like, jesus, he, never, stopped, fighting, against, these, plagues, of, the, people, the, eulogy, was, given, by, the, marquis, de, sade, delegate, of, the, section, piques, and, an, ally, of, marat, s, faction, in, the, national, convention, on, 19, november, the, port, city, of, le, havre, de, gr, ce, changed, its, name, to, le, havre, de, marat, and, then, le, havre, marat, when, the, jacobins, started, their, dechristianisation, campaign, to, set, up, the, cult, of, reason, of, h, bert, and, chaumette, and, later, the, cult, of, the, supreme, being, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, marat, was, made, a, quasi, saint, and, his, bust, often, replaced, crucifixes, in, the, former, churches, of, paris, after, the, thermidorian, reaction, marat, s, reputation, decreased, on, 13, january, 1795, le, havre, marat, became, simply, le, havre, the, name, it, bears, today, in, february, his, coffin, was, removed, from, the, panth, on, and, his, busts, and, sculptures, were, destroyed, the, 4, february, 1795, 16, pluvi, se, issue, of, le, moniteur, universel, reported, how, two, days, earlier, his, busts, had, been, knocked, off, their, pedestals, in, several, theatres, and, that, some, children, had, carried, one, of, these, busts, about, the, streets, insulting, it, dumping, it, in, the, rue, montmartre, sewer, to, shouts, of, marat, voil, ton, panth, on, his, final, resting, place, is, the, cemetery, of, the, church, of, saint, tienne, du, mont, a, bronze, sculpture, of, marat, was, removed, from, parc, des, buttes, chaumont, and, was, melted, down, during, the, nazi, occupation, of, paris, another, was, created, in, 2013, for, the, mus, e, de, la, r, volution, fran, aise, he, continued, to, be, held, in, high, regard, in, the, soviet, union, marat, became, a, common, name, and, marat, fjord, in, severnaya, zemlya, was, named, after, him, russian, battleship, petropavlovsk, russian, was, renamed, marat, in, 1921, a, street, in, the, centre, of, sevastopol, was, named, after, marat, russian, on, 3, january, 1921, shortly, after, the, bolsheviks, took, over, the, city, described, during, his, time, as, a, man, short, in, stature, deformed, in, person, and, hideous, in, face, marat, has, long, been, noted, for, physical, irregularities, the, nature, of, marat, s, debilitating, skin, disease, in, particular, has, been, an, object, of, ongoing, medical, interest, in, the, 19th, century, thomas, carlyle, alleged, that, the, cause, was, syphilis, though, this, is, very, unlikely, as, syphilitic, rashes, are, generally, neither, itchy, nor, as, long, lasting, as, marat, s, skin, condition, was, josef, e, jelinek, noted, that, his, skin, disease, was, intensely, itchy, blistering, began, in, the, perianal, region, and, was, associated, with, weight, loss, leading, to, emaciation, he, was, sick, with, it, for, the, three, years, prior, to, his, assassination, and, spent, most, of, this, time, in, his, bathtub, there, were, various, minerals, and, medicines, that, were, present, in, his, bath, while, he, soaked, to, help, ease, the, pain, caused, by, the, disease, a, bandana, wrapped, around, his, head, was, soaked, in, vinegar, to, reduce, the, severity, of, his, discomfort, jelinek, s, diagnosis, is, dermatitis, herpetiformis, after, marat, s, death, his, wife, may, have, sold, his, bathtub, to, her, journalist, neighbour, as, it, was, included, in, an, inventory, of, his, possessions, the, royalist, de, saint, hilaire, bought, the, tub, taking, it, to, sarzeau, morbihan, in, brittany, his, daughter, capriole, de, saint, hilaire, inherited, it, when, he, died, in, 1805, and, she, passed, it, on, to, the, sarzeau, cur, when, she, died, in, 1862, a, journalist, for, le, figaro, tracked, down, the, tub, in, 1885, the, cur, then, discovered, that, selling, the, tub, could, earn, money, for, the, parish, yet, the, mus, e, carnavalet, turned, it, down, because, of, its, lack, of, provenance, as, well, as, its, high, price, the, cur, approached, madame, tussaud, s, waxworks, who, agreed, to, purchase, marat, s, bathtub, for, 100, 000, francs, but, the, cur, s, acceptance, was, lost, in, the, mail, after, rejecting, other, offers, including, one, from, phineas, barnum, the, cur, sold, the, tub, for, 5, 000, francs, to, the, mus, e, gr, vin, where, it, remains, today, the, tub, was, in, the, shape, of, an, old, fashioned, high, buttoned, shoe, and, had, a, copper, lining
