gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1, july, 1646, 14, november, 1716, was, a, german, polymath, active, as, a, mathematician, philosopher, scientist, and, diplomat, who, is, disputed, with, sir, isaac, newton, to, have, invented, calculus, in, addition, to, many, other, branches, of, mathematics, such, as, binary, arithmetic, and, statistics, leibniz, has, been, called, the, last, universal, genius, due, to, his, knowledge, and, skills, in, different, fields, and, because, such, people, became, much, less, common, after, his, lifetime, with, the, coming, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, spread, of, specialized, labor, he, is, a, prominent, figure, in, both, the, history, of, philosophy, and, the, history, of, mathematics, he, wrote, works, on, philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history, philology, games, music, and, other, studies, leibniz, also, made, major, contributions, to, physics, and, technology, and, anticipated, notions, that, surfaced, much, later, in, probability, theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics, and, computer, science, in, addition, he, contributed, to, the, field, of, library, science, by, devising, a, cataloguing, system, whilst, working, at, the, herzog, august, library, in, wolfenb, ttel, germany, that, would, have, served, as, a, guide, for, many, of, europe, s, largest, libraries, leibniz, s, contributions, to, a, wide, range, of, subjects, were, scattered, in, various, learned, journals, in, tens, of, thousands, of, letters, and, in, unpublished, manuscripts, he, wrote, in, several, languages, primarily, in, latin, french, and, german, as, a, philosopher, he, was, a, leading, representative, of, 17th, century, rationalism, and, idealism, as, a, mathematician, his, major, achievement, was, the, development, of, the, main, ideas, of, differential, and, integral, calculus, independently, of, isaac, newton, s, contemporaneous, developments, mathematicians, have, consistently, favored, leibniz, s, notation, as, the, conventional, and, more, exact, expression, of, calculus, in, the, 20th, century, leibniz, s, notions, of, the, law, of, continuity, and, transcendental, law, of, homogeneity, found, a, consistent, mathematical, formulation, by, means, of, non, standard, analysis, he, was, also, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, mechanical, calculators, while, working, on, adding, automatic, multiplication, and, division, to, pascal, s, calculator, he, was, the, first, to, describe, a, pinwheel, calculator, in, 1685, and, invented, the, leibniz, wheel, later, used, in, the, arithmometer, the, first, mass, produced, mechanical, calculator, in, philosophy, and, theology, leibniz, is, most, noted, for, his, optimism, i, e, his, conclusion, that, our, world, is, in, a, qualified, sense, the, best, possible, world, that, god, could, have, created, a, view, sometimes, lampooned, by, other, thinkers, such, as, voltaire, in, his, satirical, novella, candide, leibniz, along, with, ren, descartes, and, baruch, spinoza, was, one, of, the, three, influential, early, modern, rationalists, his, philosophy, also, assimilates, elements, of, the, scholastic, tradition, notably, the, assumption, that, some, substantive, knowledge, of, reality, can, be, achieved, by, reasoning, from, first, principles, or, prior, definitions, the, work, of, leibniz, anticipated, modern, logic, and, still, influences, contemporary, analytic, philosophy, such, as, its, adopted, use, of, the, term, possible, world, to, define, modal, notions, gottfried, leibniz, was, born, on, july, 1, 1646, in, leipzig, saxony, to, friedrich, leibniz, 1597, 1652, and, catharina, schmuck, 1621, 1664, he, was, baptized, two, days, later, at, st, nicholas, church, leipzig, his, godfather, was, the, lutheran, theologian, martin, geier, his, father, died, when, he, was, six, years, old, and, leibniz, was, raised, by, his, mother, leibniz, s, father, had, been, a, professor, of, moral, philosophy, at, the, university, of, leipzig, where, he, also, served, as, dean, of, philosophy, the, boy, inherited, his, father, s, personal, library, he, was, given, free, access, to, it, from, the, age, of, seven, shortly, after, his, father, s, death, while, leibniz, s, schoolwork, was, largely, confined, to, the, study, of, a, small, canon, of, authorities, his, father, s, library, enabled, him, to, study, a, wide, variety, of, advanced, philosophical, and, theological, works, ones, that, he, would, not, have, otherwise, been, able, to, read, until, his, college, years, access, to, his, father, s, library, largely, written, in, latin, also, led, to, his, proficiency, in, the, latin, language, which, he, achieved, by, the, age, of, 12, at, the, age, of, 13, he, composed, 300, hexameters, of, latin, verse, in, a, single, morning, for, a, special, event, at, school, in, april, 1661, he, enrolled, in, his, father, s, former, university, at, age, 14, there, he, was, guided, among, others, by, jakob, thomasius, previously, a, student, of, friedrich, leibniz, completed, his, bachelor, s, degree, in, philosophy, in, december, 1662, he, defended, his, disputatio, metaphysica, de, principio, individui, metaphysical, disputation, on, the, principle, of, individuation, which, addressed, the, principle, of, individuation, on, 9, june, 1663, presenting, an, early, version, of, monadic, substance, theory, leibniz, earned, his, master, s, degree, in, philosophy, on, 7, february, 1664, in, december, 1664, he, published, and, defended, a, dissertation, specimen, quaestionum, philosophicarum, ex, jure, collectarum, an, essay, of, collected, philosophical, problems, of, right, arguing, for, both, a, theoretical, and, a, pedagogical, relationship, between, philosophy, and, law, after, one, year, of, legal, studies, he, was, awarded, his, bachelor, s, degree, in, law, on, 28, september, 1665, his, dissertation, was, titled, de, conditionibus, on, conditions, in, early, 1666, at, age, 19, leibniz, wrote, his, first, book, de, arte, combinatoria, on, the, combinatorial, art, the, first, part, of, which, was, also, his, habilitation, thesis, in, philosophy, which, he, defended, in, march, 1666, de, arte, combinatoria, was, inspired, by, ramon, llull, s, ars, magna, and, contained, a, proof, of, the, existence, of, god, cast, in, geometrical, form, and, based, on, the, argument, from, motion, his, next, goal, was, to, earn, his, license, and, doctorate, in, law, which, normally, required, three, years, of, study, in, 1666, the, university, of, leipzig, turned, down, leibniz, s, doctoral, application, and, refused, to, grant, him, a, doctorate, in, law, most, likely, due, to, his, relative, youth, leibniz, subsequently, left, leipzig, leibniz, then, enrolled, in, the, university, of, altdorf, and, quickly, submitted, a, thesis, which, he, had, probably, been, working, on, earlier, in, leipzig, the, title, of, his, thesis, was, disputatio, inauguralis, de, casibus, perplexis, in, jure, inaugural, disputation, on, ambiguous, legal, cases, leibniz, earned, his, license, to, practice, law, and, his, doctorate, in, law, in, november, 1666, he, next, declined, the, offer, of, an, academic, appointment, at, altdorf, saying, that, my, thoughts, were, turned, in, an, entirely, different, direction, as, an, adult, leibniz, often, introduced, himself, as, gottfried, von, leibniz, many, posthumously, published, editions, of, his, writings, presented, his, name, on, the, title, page, as, freiherr, g, w, von, leibniz, however, no, document, has, ever, been, found, from, any, contemporary, government, that, stated, his, appointment, to, any, form, of, nobility, leibniz, s, first, position, was, as, a, salaried, secretary, to, an, alchemical, society, in, nuremberg, he, knew, fairly, little, about, the, subject, at, that, time, but, presented, himself, as, deeply, learned, he, soon, met, johann, christian, von, boyneburg, 1622, 1672, the, dismissed, chief, minister, of, the, elector, of, mainz, johann, philipp, von, sch, nborn, von, boyneburg, hired, leibniz, as, an, assistant, and, shortly, thereafter, reconciled, with, the, elector, and, introduced, leibniz, to, him, leibniz, then, dedicated, an, essay, on, law, to, the, elector, in, the, hope, of, obtaining, employment, the, stratagem, worked, the, elector, asked, leibniz, to, assist, with, the, redrafting, of, the, legal, code, for, the, electorate, in, 1669, leibniz, was, appointed, assessor, in, the, court, of, appeal, although, von, boyneburg, died, late, in, 1672, leibniz, remained, under, the, employment, of, his, widow, until, she, dismissed, him, in, 1674, von, boyneburg, did, much, to, promote, leibniz, s, reputation, and, the, latter, s, memoranda, and, letters, began, to, attract, favorable, notice, after, leibniz, s, service, to, the, elector, there, soon, followed, a, diplomatic, role, he, published, an, essay, under, the, pseudonym, of, a, fictitious, polish, nobleman, arguing, unsuccessfully, for, the, german, candidate, for, the, polish, crown, the, main, force, in, european, geopolitics, during, leibniz, s, adult, life, was, the, ambition, of, louis, xiv, of, france, backed, by, french, military, and, economic, might, meanwhile, the, thirty, years, war, had, left, german, speaking, europe, exhausted, fragmented, and, economically, backward, leibniz, proposed, to, protect, german, speaking, europe, by, distracting, louis, as, follows, france, would, be, invited, to, take, egypt, as, a, stepping, stone, towards, an, eventual, conquest, of, the, dutch, east, indies, in, return, france, would, agree, to, leave, germany, and, the, netherlands, undisturbed, this, plan, obtained, the, elector, s, cautious, support, in, 1672, the, french, government, invited, leibniz, to, paris, for, discussion, but, the, plan, was, soon, overtaken, by, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, dutch, war, and, became, irrelevant, napoleon, s, failed, invasion, of, egypt, in, 1798, can, be, seen, as, an, unwitting, late, implementation, of, leibniz, s, plan, after, the, eastern, hemisphere, colonial, supremacy, in, europe, had, already, passed, from, the, dutch, to, the, british, thus, leibniz, went, to, paris, in, 1672, soon, after, arriving, he, met, dutch, physicist, and, mathematician, christiaan, huygens, and, realised, that, his, own, knowledge, of, mathematics, and, physics, was, patchy, with, huygens, as, his, mentor, he, began, a, program, of, self, study, that, soon, pushed, him, to, making, major, contributions, to, both, subjects, including, discovering, his, version, of, the, differential, and, integral, calculus, he, met, nicolas, malebranche, and, antoine, arnauld, the, leading, french, philosophers, of, the, day, and, studied, the, writings, of, descartes, and, pascal, unpublished, as, well, as, published, he, befriended, a, german, mathematician, ehrenfried, walther, von, tschirnhaus, they, corresponded, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, when, it, became, clear, that, france, would, not, implement, its, part, of, leibniz, s, egyptian, plan, the, elector, sent, his, nephew, escorted, by, leibniz, on, a, related, mission, to, the, english, government, in, london, early, in, 1673, there, leibniz, came, into, acquaintance, of, henry, oldenburg, and, john, collins, he, met, with, the, royal, society, where, he, demonstrated, a, calculating, machine, that, he, had, designed, and, had, been, building, since, 1670, the, machine, was, able, to, execute, all, four, basic, operations, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and, dividing, and, the, society, quickly, made, him, an, external, member, the, mission, ended, abruptly, when, news, of, the, elector, s, death, 12, february, 1673, reached, them, leibniz, promptly, returned, to, paris, and, not, as, had, been, planned, to, mainz, the, sudden, deaths, of, his, two, patrons, in, the, same, winter, meant, that, leibniz, had, to, find, a, new, basis, for, his, career, in, this, regard, a, 1669, invitation, from, duke, john, frederick, of, brunswick, to, visit, hanover, proved, to, have, been, fateful, leibniz, had, declined, the, invitation, but, had, begun, corresponding, with, the, duke, in, 1671, in, 1673, the, duke, offered, leibniz, the, post, of, counsellor, leibniz, very, reluctantly, accepted, the, position, two, years, later, only, after, it, became, clear, that, no, employment, was, forthcoming, in, paris, whose, intellectual, stimulation, he, relished, or, with, the, habsburg, imperial, court, in, 1675, he, tried, to, get, admitted, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, as, a, foreign, honorary, member, but, it, was, considered, that, there, were, already, enough, foreigners, there, and, so, no, invitation, came, he, left, paris, in, october, 1676, leibniz, managed, to, delay, his, arrival, in, hanover, until, the, end, of, 1676, after, making, one, more, short, journey, to, london, where, newton, accused, him, of, having, seen, his, unpublished, work, on, calculus, in, advance, this, was, alleged, to, be, evidence, supporting, the, accusation, made, decades, later, that, he, had, stolen, calculus, from, newton, on, the, journey, from, london, to, hanover, leibniz, stopped, in, the, hague, where, he, met, van, leeuwenhoek, the, discoverer, of, microorganisms, he, also, spent, several, days, in, intense, discussion, with, spinoza, who, had, just, completed, but, had, not, published, his, masterwork, the, ethics, spinoza, died, very, shortly, after, leibniz, s, visit, in, 1677, he, was, promoted, at, his, request, to, privy, counselor, of, justice, a, post, he, held, for, the, rest, of, his, life, leibniz, served, three, consecutive, rulers, of, the, house, of, brunswick, as, historian, political, adviser, and, most, consequentially, as, librarian, of, the, ducal, library, he, thenceforth, employed, his, pen, on, all, the, various, political, historical, and, theological, matters, involving, the, house, of, brunswick, the, resulting, documents, form, a, valuable, part, of, the, historical, record, for, the, period, leibniz, began, promoting, a, project, to, use, windmills, to, improve, the, mining, operations, in, the, harz, mountains, this, project, did, little, to, improve, mining, operations, and, was, shut, down, by, duke, ernst, august, in, 1685, among, the, few, people, in, north, germany, to, accept, leibniz, were, the, electress, sophia, of, hanover, 1630, 1714, her, daughter, sophia, charlotte, of, hanover, 1668, 1705, the, queen, of, prussia, and, his, avowed, disciple, and, caroline, of, ansbach, the, consort, of, her, grandson, the, future, george, ii, to, each, of, these, women, he, was, correspondent, adviser, and, friend, in, turn, they, all, approved, of, leibniz, more, than, did, their, spouses, and, the, future, king, george, i, of, great, britain, the, population, of, hanover, was, only, about, 10, 000, and, its, provinciality, eventually, grated, on, leibniz, nevertheless, to, be, a, major, courtier, to, the, house, of, brunswick, was, quite, an, honor, especially, in, light, of, the, meteoric, rise, in, the, prestige, of, that, house, during, leibniz, s, association, with, it, in, 1692, the, duke, of, brunswick, became, a, hereditary, elector, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, british, act, of, settlement, 1701, designated, the, electress, sophia, and, her, descent, as, the, royal, family, of, england, once, both, king, william, iii, and, his, sister, in, law, and, successor, queen, anne, were, dead, leibniz, played, a, role, in, the, initiatives, and, negotiations, leading, up, to, that, act, but, not, always, an, effective, one, for, example, something, he, published, anonymously, in, england, thinking, to, promote, the, brunswick, cause, was, formally, censured, by, the, british, parliament, the, brunswicks, tolerated, the, enormous, effort, leibniz, devoted, to, intellectual, pursuits, unrelated, to, his, duties, as, a, courtier, pursuits, such, as, perfecting, calculus, writing, about, other, mathematics, logic, physics, and, philosophy, and, keeping, up, a, vast, correspondence, he, began, working, on, calculus, in, 1674, the, earliest, evidence, of, its, use, in, his, surviving, notebooks, is, 1675, by, 1677, he, had, a, coherent, system, in, hand, but, did, not, publish, it, until, 1684, leibniz, s, most, important, mathematical, papers, were, published, between, 1682, and, 1692, usually, in, a, journal, which, he, and, otto, mencke, founded, in, 1682, the, acta, eruditorum, that, journal, played, a, key, role, in, advancing, his, mathematical, and, scientific, reputation, which, in, turn, enhanced, his, eminence, in, diplomacy, history, theology, and, philosophy, the, elector, ernest, augustus, commissioned, leibniz, to, write, a, history, of, the, house, of, brunswick, going, back, to, the, time, of, charlemagne, or, earlier, hoping, that, the, resulting, book, would, advance, his, dynastic, ambitions, from, 1687, to, 1690, leibniz, traveled, extensively, in, germany, austria, and, italy, seeking, and, finding, archival, materials, bearing, on, this, project, decades, went, by, but, no, history, appeared, the, next, elector, became, quite, annoyed, at, leibniz, s, apparent, dilatoriness, leibniz, never, finished, the, project, in, part, because, of, his, huge, output, on, many, other, fronts, but, also, because, he, insisted, on, writing, a, meticulously, researched, and, erudite, book, based, on, archival, sources, when, his, patrons, would, have, been, quite, happy, with, a, short, popular, book, one, perhaps, little, more, than, a, genealogy, with, commentary, to, be, completed, in, three, years, or, less, they, never, knew, that, he, had, in, fact, carried, out, a, fair, part, of, his, assigned, task, when, the, material, leibniz, had, written, and, collected, for, his, history, of, the, house, of, brunswick, was, finally, published, in, the, 19th, century, it, filled, three, volumes, leibniz, was, appointed, librarian, of, the, herzog, august, library, in, wolfenb, ttel, lower, saxony, in, 1691, in, 1708, john, keill, writing, in, the, journal, of, the, royal, society, and, with, newton, s, presumed, blessing, accused, leibniz, of, having, plagiarised, newton, s, calculus, thus, began, the, calculus, priority, dispute, which, darkened, the, remainder, of, leibniz, s, life, a, formal, investigation, by, the, royal, society, in, which, newton, was, an, unacknowledged, participant, undertaken, in, response, to, leibniz, s, demand, for, a, retraction, upheld, keill, s, charge, historians, of, mathematics, writing, since, 1900, or, so, have, tended, to, acquit, leibniz, pointing, to, important, differences, between, leibniz, s, and, newton, s, versions, of, calculus, in, 1712, leibniz, began, a, two, year, residence, in, vienna, where, he, was, appointed, imperial, court, councillor, to, the, habsburgs, on, the, death, of, queen, anne, in, 1714, elector, george, louis, became, king, george, i, of, great, britain, under, the, terms, of, the, 1701, act, of, settlement, even, though, leibniz, had, done, much, to, bring, about, this, happy, event, it, was, not, to, be, his, hour, of, glory, despite, the, intercession, of, the, princess, of, wales, caroline, of, ansbach, george, i, forbade, leibniz, to, join, him, in, london, until, he, completed, at, least, one, volume, of, the, history, of, the, brunswick, family, his, father, had, commissioned, nearly, 30, years, earlier, moreover, for, george, i, to, include, leibniz, in, his, london, court, would, have, been, deemed, insulting, to, newton, who, was, seen, as, having, won, the, calculus, priority, dispute, and, whose, standing, in, british, official, circles, could, not, have, been, higher, finally, his, dear, friend, and, defender, the, dowager, electress, sophia, died, in, 1714, in, 1716, while, traveling, in, northern, europe, the, russian, tsar, peter, the, great, stopped, in, bad, pyrmont, and, met, leibniz, who, took, interest, in, russian, matters, since, 1708, and, was, appointed, advisor, in, 1711, leibniz, died, in, hanover, in, 1716, at, the, time, he, was, so, out, of, favor, that, neither, george, i, who, happened, to, be, near, hanover, at, that, time, nor, any, fellow, courtier, other, than, his, personal, secretary, attended, the, funeral, even, though, leibniz, was, a, life, member, of, the, royal, society, and, the, berlin, academy, of, sciences, neither, organization, saw, fit, to, honor, his, death, his, grave, went, unmarked, for, more, than, 50, years, he, was, however, eulogized, by, fontenelle, before, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, paris, which, had, admitted, him, as, a, foreign, member, in, 1700, the, eulogy, was, composed, at, the, behest, of, the, duchess, of, orleans, a, niece, of, the, electress, sophia, leibniz, never, married, he, proposed, to, an, unknown, woman, at, age, 50, but, changed, his, mind, when, she, took, too, long, to, decide, he, complained, on, occasion, about, money, but, the, fair, sum, he, left, to, his, sole, heir, his, sister, s, stepson, proved, that, the, brunswicks, had, paid, him, fairly, well, in, his, diplomatic, endeavors, he, at, times, verged, on, the, unscrupulous, as, was, often, the, case, with, professional, diplomats, of, his, day, on, several, occasions, leibniz, backdated, and, altered, personal, manuscripts, actions, which, put, him, in, a, bad, light, during, the, calculus, controversy, he, was, charming, well, mannered, and, not, without, humor, and, imagination, he, had, many, friends, and, admirers, all, over, europe, he, was, identified, as, a, protestant, and, a, philosophical, theist, leibniz, remained, committed, to, trinitarian, christianity, throughout, his, life, leibniz, s, philosophical, thinking, appears, fragmented, because, his, philosophical, writings, consist, mainly, of, a, multitude, of, short, pieces, journal, articles, manuscripts, published, long, after, his, death, and, letters, to, correspondents, he, wrote, two, book, length, philosophical, treatises, of, which, only, the, th, odic, e, of, 1710, was, published, in, his, lifetime, leibniz, dated, his, beginning, as, a, philosopher, to, his, discourse, on, metaphysics, which, he, composed, in, 1686, as, a, commentary, on, a, running, dispute, between, nicolas, malebranche, and, antoine, arnauld, this, led, to, an, extensive, correspondence, with, arnauld, it, and, the, discourse, were, not, published, until, the, 19th, century, in, 1695, leibniz, made, his, public, entr, e, into, european, philosophy, with, a, journal, article, titled, new, system, of, the, nature, and, communication, of, substances, between, 1695, and, 1705, he, composed, his, new, essays, on, human, understanding, a, lengthy, commentary, on, john, locke, s, 1690, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, but, upon, learning, of, locke, s, 1704, death, lost, the, desire, to, publish, it, so, that, the, new, essays, were, not, published, until, 1765, the, monadologie, composed, in, 1714, and, published, posthumously, consists, of, 90, aphorisms, leibniz, also, wrote, a, short, paper, primae, veritates, first, truths, first, published, by, louis, couturat, in, 1903, pp, 518, 523, summarizing, his, views, on, metaphysics, the, paper, is, undated, that, he, wrote, it, while, in, vienna, in, 1689, was, determined, only, in, 1999, when, the, ongoing, critical, edition, finally, published, leibniz, s, philosophical, writings, for, the, period, 1677, 1690, couturat, s, reading, of, this, paper, influenced, much, 20th, century, thinking, about, leibniz, especially, among, analytic, philosophers, after, a, meticulous, study, informed, by, the, 1999, additions, to, the, critical, edition, of, all, of, leibniz, s, philosophical, writings, up, to, 1688, mercer, 2001, disagreed, with, couturat, s, reading, leibniz, met, baruch, spinoza, in, 1676, read, some, of, his, unpublished, writings, and, had, since, been, influenced, by, some, of, spinoza, s, ideas, while, leibniz, befriended, him, and, admired, spinoza, s, powerful, intellect, he, was, also, dismayed, by, spinoza, s, conclusions, especially, when, these, were, inconsistent, with, christian, orthodoxy, unlike, descartes, and, spinoza, leibniz, had, a, university, education, in, philosophy, he, was, influenced, by, his, leipzig, professor, jakob, thomasius, who, also, supervised, his, ba, thesis, in, philosophy, leibniz, also, read, francisco, su, rez, a, spanish, jesuit, respected, even, in, lutheran, universities, leibniz, was, deeply, interested, in, the, new, methods, and, conclusions, of, descartes, huygens, newton, and, boyle, but, the, established, philosophical, ideas, in, which, he, was, educated, influenced, his, view, of, their, work, leibniz, variously, invoked, one, or, another, of, seven, fundamental, philosophical, principles, leibniz, would, on, occasion, give, a, rational, defense, of, a, specific, principle, but, more, often, took, them, for, granted, leibniz, s, best, known, contribution, to, metaphysics, is, his, theory, of, monads, as, exposited, in, monadologie, he, proposes, his, theory, that, the, universe, is, made, of, an, infinite, number, of, simple, substances, known, as, monads, monads, can, also, be, compared, to, the, corpuscles, of, the, mechanical, philosophy, of, ren, descartes, and, others, these, simple, substances, or, monads, are, the, ultimate, units, of, existence, in, nature, monads, have, no, parts, but, still, exist, by, the, qualities, that, they, have, these, qualities, are, continuously, changing, over, time, and, each, monad, is, unique, they, are, also, not, affected, by, time, and, are, subject, to, only, creation, and, annihilation, monads, are, centers, of, force, substance, is, force, while, space, matter, and, motion, are, merely, phenomenal, he, argued, against, newton, that, space, time, and, motion, are, completely, relative, as, for, my, own, opinion, i, have, said, more, than, once, that, i, hold, space, to, be, something, merely, relative, as, time, is, that, i, hold, it, to, be, an, order, of, coexistences, as, time, is, an, order, of, successions, einstein, who, called, himself, a, leibnizian, wrote, in, the, introduction, to, max, jammer, s, book, concepts, of, space, that, leibnizianism, was, superior, to, newtonianism, and, his, ideas, would, have, dominated, over, newton, s, had, it, not, been, for, the, poor, technological, tools, of, the, time, joseph, agassi, argues, that, leibniz, paved, the, way, for, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, leibniz, s, proof, of, god, can, be, summarized, in, the, th, odic, e, reason, is, governed, by, the, principle, of, contradiction, and, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, using, the, principle, of, reasoning, leibniz, concluded, that, the, first, reason, of, all, things, is, god, all, that, we, see, and, experience, is, subject, to, change, and, the, fact, that, this, world, is, contingent, can, be, explained, by, the, possibility, of, the, world, being, arranged, differently, in, space, and, time, the, contingent, world, must, have, some, necessary, reason, for, its, existence, leibniz, uses, a, geometry, book, as, an, example, to, explain, his, reasoning, if, this, book, was, copied, from, an, infinite, chain, of, copies, there, must, be, some, reason, for, the, content, of, the, book, leibniz, concluded, that, there, must, be, the, monas, monadum, or, god, the, ontological, essence, of, a, monad, is, its, irreducible, simplicity, unlike, atoms, monads, possess, no, material, or, spatial, character, they, also, differ, from, atoms, by, their, complete, mutual, independence, so, that, interactions, among, monads, are, only, apparent, instead, by, virtue, of, the, principle, of, pre, established, harmony, each, monad, follows, a, pre, programmed, set, of, instructions, peculiar, to, itself, so, that, a, monad, knows, what, to, do, at, each, moment, by, virtue, of, these, intrinsic, instructions, each, monad, is, like, a, little, mirror, of, the, universe, monads, need, not, be, small, e, g, each, human, being, constitutes, a, monad, in, which, case, free, will, is, problematic, monads, are, purported, to, have, gotten, rid, of, the, problematic, the, theodicy, tries, to, justify, the, apparent, imperfections, of, the, world, by, claiming, that, it, is, optimal, among, all, possible, worlds, it, must, be, the, best, possible, and, most, balanced, world, because, it, was, created, by, an, all, powerful, and, all, knowing, god, who, would, not, choose, to, create, an, imperfect, world, if, a, better, world, could, be, known, to, him, or, possible, to, exist, in, effect, apparent, flaws, that, can, be, identified, in, this, world, must, exist, in, every, possible, world, because, otherwise, god, would, have, chosen, to, create, the, world, that, excluded, those, flaws, leibniz, asserted, that, the, truths, of, theology, religion, and, philosophy, cannot, contradict, each, other, since, reason, and, faith, are, both, gifts, of, god, so, that, their, conflict, would, imply, god, contending, against, himself, the, theodicy, is, leibniz, s, attempt, to, reconcile, his, personal, philosophical, system, with, his, interpretation, of, the, tenets, of, christianity, this, project, was, motivated, in, part, by, leibniz, s, belief, shared, by, many, philosophers, and, theologians, during, the, enlightenment, in, the, rational, and, enlightened, nature, of, the, christian, religion, it, was, also, shaped, by, leibniz, s, belief, in, the, perfectibility, of, human, nature, if, humanity, relied, on, correct, philosophy, and, religion, as, a, guide, and, by, his, belief, that, metaphysical, necessity, must, have, a, rational, or, logical, foundation, even, if, this, metaphysical, causality, seemed, inexplicable, in, terms, of, physical, necessity, the, natural, laws, identified, by, science, in, the, view, of, leibniz, because, reason, and, faith, must, be, entirely, reconciled, any, tenet, of, faith, which, could, not, be, defended, by, reason, must, be, rejected, leibniz, then, approached, one, of, the, central, criticisms, of, christian, theism, if, god, is, all, good, all, wise, and, all, powerful, then, how, did, evil, come, into, the, world, the, answer, according, to, leibniz, is, that, while, god, is, indeed, unlimited, in, wisdom, and, power, his, human, creations, as, creations, are, limited, both, in, their, wisdom, and, in, their, will, power, to, act, this, predisposes, humans, to, false, beliefs, wrong, decisions, and, ineffective, actions, in, the, exercise, of, their, free, will, god, does, not, arbitrarily, inflict, pain, and, suffering, on, humans, rather, he, permits, both, moral, evil, sin, and, physical, evil, pain, and, suffering, as, the, necessary, consequences, of, metaphysical, evil, imperfection, as, a, means, by, which, humans, can, identify, and, correct, their, erroneous, decisions, and, as, a, contrast, to, true, good, further, although, human, actions, flow, from, prior, causes, that, ultimately, arise, in, god, and, therefore, are, known, to, god, as, metaphysical, certainties, an, individual, s, free, will, is, exercised, within, natural, laws, where, choices, are, merely, contingently, necessary, and, to, be, decided, in, the, event, by, a, wonderful, spontaneity, that, provides, individuals, with, an, escape, from, rigorous, predestination, for, leibniz, god, is, an, absolutely, perfect, being, he, describes, this, perfection, later, in, section, vi, as, the, simplest, form, of, something, with, the, most, substantial, outcome, vi, along, these, lines, he, declares, that, every, type, of, perfection, pertains, to, him, god, in, the, highest, degree, i, even, though, his, types, of, perfections, are, not, specifically, drawn, out, leibniz, highlights, the, one, thing, that, to, him, does, certify, imperfections, and, proves, that, god, is, perfect, that, one, acts, imperfectly, if, he, acts, with, less, perfection, than, he, is, capable, of, and, since, god, is, a, perfect, being, he, cannot, act, imperfectly, iii, because, god, cannot, act, imperfectly, the, decisions, he, makes, pertaining, to, the, world, must, be, perfect, leibniz, also, comforts, readers, stating, that, because, he, has, done, everything, to, the, most, perfect, degree, those, who, love, him, cannot, be, injured, however, to, love, god, is, a, subject, of, difficulty, as, leibniz, believes, that, we, are, not, disposed, to, wish, for, that, which, god, desires, because, we, have, the, ability, to, alter, our, disposition, iv, in, accordance, with, this, many, act, as, rebels, but, leibniz, says, that, the, only, way, we, can, truly, love, god, is, by, being, content, with, all, that, comes, to, us, according, to, his, will, iv, because, god, is, an, absolutely, perfect, being, i, leibniz, argues, that, god, would, be, acting, imperfectly, if, he, acted, with, any, less, perfection, than, what, he, is, able, of, iii, his, syllogism, then, ends, with, the, statement, that, god, has, made, the, world, perfectly, in, all, ways, this, also, affects, how, we, should, view, god, and, his, will, leibniz, states, that, in, lieu, of, god, s, will, we, have, to, understand, that, god, is, the, best, of, all, masters, and, he, will, know, when, his, good, succeeds, so, we, therefore, must, act, in, conformity, to, his, good, will, or, as, much, of, it, as, we, understand, iv, in, our, view, of, god, leibniz, declares, that, we, cannot, admire, the, work, solely, because, of, the, maker, lest, we, mar, the, glory, and, love, god, in, doing, so, instead, we, must, admire, the, maker, for, the, work, he, has, done, ii, effectively, leibniz, states, that, if, we, say, the, earth, is, good, because, of, the, will, of, god, and, not, good, according, to, some, standards, of, goodness, then, how, can, we, praise, god, for, what, he, has, done, if, contrary, actions, are, also, praiseworthy, by, this, definition, ii, leibniz, then, asserts, that, different, principles, and, geometry, cannot, simply, be, from, the, will, of, god, but, must, follow, from, his, understanding, leibniz, wrote, why, is, there, something, rather, than, nothing, the, sufficient, reason, is, found, in, a, substance, which, is, a, necessary, being, bearing, the, reason, for, its, existence, within, itself, martin, heidegger, called, this, question, the, fundamental, question, of, metaphysics, leibniz, believed, that, much, of, human, reasoning, could, be, reduced, to, calculations, of, a, sort, and, that, such, calculations, could, resolve, many, differences, of, opinion, the, only, way, to, rectify, our, reasonings, is, to, make, them, as, tangible, as, those, of, the, mathematicians, so, that, we, can, find, our, error, at, a, glance, and, when, there, are, disputes, among, persons, we, can, simply, say, let, us, calculate, without, further, ado, to, see, who, is, right, leibniz, s, calculus, ratiocinator, which, resembles, symbolic, logic, can, be, viewed, as, a, way, of, making, such, calculations, feasible, leibniz, wrote, memoranda, that, can, now, be, read, as, groping, attempts, to, get, symbolic, logic, and, thus, his, calculus, off, the, ground, these, writings, remained, unpublished, until, the, appearance, of, a, selection, edited, by, carl, immanuel, gerhardt, 1859, louis, couturat, published, a, selection, in, 1901, by, this, time, the, main, developments, of, modern, logic, had, been, created, by, charles, sanders, peirce, and, by, gottlob, frege, leibniz, thought, symbols, were, important, for, human, understanding, he, attached, so, much, importance, to, the, development, of, good, notations, that, he, attributed, all, his, discoveries, in, mathematics, to, this, his, notation, for, calculus, is, an, example, of, his, skill, in, this, regard, leibniz, s, passion, for, symbols, and, notation, as, well, as, his, belief, that, these, are, essential, to, a, well, running, logic, and, mathematics, made, him, a, precursor, of, semiotics, but, leibniz, took, his, speculations, much, further, defining, a, character, as, any, written, sign, he, then, defined, a, real, character, as, one, that, represents, an, idea, directly, and, not, simply, as, the, word, embodying, the, idea, some, real, characters, such, as, the, notation, of, logic, serve, only, to, facilitate, reasoning, many, characters, well, known, in, his, day, including, egyptian, hieroglyphics, chinese, characters, and, the, symbols, of, astronomy, and, chemistry, he, deemed, not, real, instead, he, proposed, the, creation, of, a, characteristica, universalis, or, universal, characteristic, built, on, an, alphabet, of, human, thought, in, which, each, fundamental, concept, would, be, represented, by, a, unique, real, character, it, is, obvious, that, if, we, could, find, characters, or, signs, suited, for, expressing, all, our, thoughts, as, clearly, and, as, exactly, as, arithmetic, expresses, numbers, or, geometry, expresses, lines, we, could, do, in, all, matters, insofar, as, they, are, subject, to, reasoning, all, that, we, can, do, in, arithmetic, and, geometry, for, all, investigations, which, depend, on, reasoning, would, be, carried, out, by, transposing, these, characters, and, by, a, species, of, calculus, complex, thoughts, would, be, represented, by, combining, characters, for, simpler, thoughts, leibniz, saw, that, the, uniqueness, of, prime, factorization, suggests, a, central, role, for, prime, numbers, in, the, universal, characteristic, a, striking, anticipation, of, g, del, numbering, granted, there, is, no, intuitive, or, mnemonic, way, to, number, any, set, of, elementary, concepts, using, the, prime, numbers, because, leibniz, was, a, mathematical, novice, when, he, first, wrote, about, the, characteristic, at, first, he, did, not, conceive, it, as, an, algebra, but, rather, as, a, universal, language, or, script, only, in, 1676, did, he, conceive, of, a, kind, of, algebra, of, thought, modeled, on, and, including, conventional, algebra, and, its, notation, the, resulting, characteristic, included, a, logical, calculus, some, combinatorics, algebra, his, analysis, situs, geometry, of, situation, a, universal, concept, language, and, more, what, leibniz, actually, intended, by, his, characteristica, universalis, and, calculus, ratiocinator, and, the, extent, to, which, modern, formal, logic, does, justice, to, calculus, may, never, be, established, leibniz, s, idea, of, reasoning, through, a, universal, language, of, symbols, and, calculations, remarkably, foreshadows, great, 20th, century, developments, in, formal, systems, such, as, turing, completeness, where, computation, was, used, to, define, equivalent, universal, languages, see, turing, degree, leibniz, has, been, noted, as, one, of, the, most, important, logicians, between, the, times, of, aristotle, and, gottlob, frege, leibniz, enunciated, the, principal, properties, of, what, we, now, call, conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, set, inclusion, and, the, empty, set, the, principles, of, leibniz, s, logic, and, arguably, of, his, whole, philosophy, reduce, to, two, the, formal, logic, that, emerged, early, in, the, 20th, century, also, requires, at, minimum, unary, negation, and, quantified, variables, ranging, over, some, universe, of, discourse, leibniz, published, nothing, on, formal, logic, in, his, lifetime, most, of, what, he, wrote, on, the, subject, consists, of, working, drafts, in, his, history, of, western, philosophy, bertrand, russell, went, so, far, as, to, claim, that, leibniz, had, developed, logic, in, his, unpublished, writings, to, a, level, which, was, reached, only, 200, years, later, russell, s, principal, work, on, leibniz, found, that, many, of, leibniz, s, most, startling, philosophical, ideas, and, claims, e, g, that, each, of, the, fundamental, monads, mirrors, the, whole, universe, follow, logically, from, leibniz, s, conscious, choice, to, reject, relations, between, things, as, unreal, he, regarded, such, relations, as, real, qualities, of, things, leibniz, admitted, unary, predicates, only, for, him, mary, is, the, mother, of, john, describes, separate, qualities, of, mary, and, of, john, this, view, contrasts, with, the, relational, logic, of, de, morgan, peirce, schr, der, and, russell, himself, now, standard, in, predicate, logic, notably, leibniz, also, declared, space, and, time, to, be, inherently, relational, leibniz, s, 1690, discovery, of, his, algebra, of, concepts, deductively, equivalent, to, the, boolean, algebra, and, the, associated, metaphysics, are, of, interest, in, present, day, computational, metaphysics, although, the, mathematical, notion, of, function, was, implicit, in, trigonometric, and, logarithmic, tables, which, existed, in, his, day, leibniz, was, the, first, in, 1692, and, 1694, to, employ, it, explicitly, to, denote, any, of, several, geometric, concepts, derived, from, a, curve, such, as, abscissa, ordinate, tangent, chord, and, the, perpendicular, see, history, of, the, function, concept, in, the, 18th, century, function, lost, these, geometrical, associations, leibniz, was, also, one, of, the, pioneers, in, actuarial, science, calculating, the, purchase, price, of, life, annuities, and, the, liquidation, of, a, state, s, debt, leibniz, s, research, into, formal, logic, also, relevant, to, mathematics, is, discussed, in, the, preceding, section, the, best, overview, of, leibniz, s, writings, on, calculus, may, be, found, in, bos, 1974, leibniz, who, invented, one, of, the, earliest, mechanical, calculators, said, of, calculation, for, it, is, unworthy, of, excellent, men, to, lose, hours, like, slaves, in, the, labor, of, calculation, which, could, safely, be, relegated, to, anyone, else, if, machines, were, used, leibniz, arranged, the, coefficients, of, a, system, of, linear, equations, into, an, array, now, called, a, matrix, in, order, to, find, a, solution, to, the, system, if, it, existed, this, method, was, later, called, gaussian, elimination, leibniz, laid, down, the, foundations, and, theory, of, determinants, although, the, japanese, mathematician, seki, takakazu, also, discovered, determinants, independently, of, leibniz, his, works, show, calculating, the, determinants, using, cofactors, calculating, the, determinant, using, cofactors, is, named, the, leibniz, formula, finding, the, determinant, of, a, matrix, using, this, method, proves, impractical, with, large, n, requiring, to, calculate, n, products, and, the, number, of, n, permutations, he, also, solved, systems, of, linear, equations, using, determinants, which, is, now, called, cramer, s, rule, this, method, for, solving, systems, of, linear, equations, based, on, determinants, was, found, in, 1684, by, leibniz, cramer, published, his, findings, in, 1750, although, gaussian, elimination, requires, o, n, 3, displaystyle, o, n, 3, arithmetic, operations, linear, algebra, textbooks, still, teach, cofactor, expansion, before, lu, factorization, the, leibniz, formula, for, states, that, leibniz, wrote, that, circles, can, most, simply, be, expressed, by, this, series, that, is, the, aggregate, of, fractions, alternately, added, and, subtracted, however, this, formula, is, only, accurate, with, a, large, number, of, terms, using, 10, 000, 000, terms, to, obtain, the, correct, value, of, 4, to, 8, decimal, places, leibniz, attempted, to, create, a, definition, for, a, straight, line, while, attempting, to, prove, the, parallel, postulate, while, most, mathematicians, defined, a, straight, line, as, the, shortest, line, between, two, points, leibniz, believed, that, this, was, merely, a, property, of, a, straight, line, rather, than, the, definition, leibniz, is, credited, along, with, isaac, newton, with, the, discovery, of, calculus, differential, and, integral, calculus, according, to, leibniz, s, notebooks, a, critical, breakthrough, occurred, on, 11, november, 1675, when, he, employed, integral, calculus, for, the, first, time, to, find, the, area, under, the, graph, of, a, function, y, f, x, he, introduced, several, notations, used, to, this, day, for, instance, the, integral, sign, f, x, d, x, displaystyle, displaystyle, int, f, x, dx, representing, an, elongated, s, from, the, latin, word, summa, and, the, d, used, for, differentials, d, y, d, x, displaystyle, frac, dy, dx, from, the, latin, word, differentia, leibniz, did, not, publish, anything, about, his, calculus, until, 1684, leibniz, expressed, the, inverse, relation, of, integration, and, differentiation, later, called, the, fundamental, theorem, of, calculus, by, means, of, a, figure, in, his, 1693, paper, supplementum, geometriae, dimensoriae, however, james, gregory, is, credited, for, the, theorem, s, discovery, in, geometric, form, isaac, barrow, proved, a, more, generalized, geometric, version, and, newton, developed, supporting, theory, the, concept, became, more, transparent, as, developed, through, leibniz, s, formalism, and, new, notation, the, product, rule, of, differential, calculus, is, still, called, leibniz, s, law, in, addition, the, theorem, that, tells, how, and, when, to, differentiate, under, the, integral, sign, is, called, the, leibniz, integral, rule, leibniz, exploited, infinitesimals, in, developing, calculus, manipulating, them, in, ways, suggesting, that, they, had, paradoxical, algebraic, properties, george, berkeley, in, a, tract, called, the, analyst, and, also, in, de, motu, criticized, these, a, recent, study, argues, that, leibnizian, calculus, was, free, of, contradictions, and, was, better, grounded, than, berkeley, s, empiricist, criticisms, from, 1711, until, his, death, leibniz, was, engaged, in, a, dispute, with, john, keill, newton, and, others, over, whether, leibniz, had, invented, calculus, independently, of, newton, the, use, of, infinitesimals, in, mathematics, was, frowned, upon, by, followers, of, karl, weierstrass, but, survived, in, science, and, engineering, and, even, in, rigorous, mathematics, via, the, fundamental, computational, device, known, as, the, differential, beginning, in, 1960, abraham, robinson, worked, out, a, rigorous, foundation, for, leibniz, s, infinitesimals, using, model, theory, in, the, context, of, a, field, of, hyperreal, numbers, the, resulting, non, standard, analysis, can, be, seen, as, a, belated, vindication, of, leibniz, s, mathematical, reasoning, robinson, s, transfer, principle, is, a, mathematical, implementation, of, leibniz, s, heuristic, law, of, continuity, while, the, standard, part, function, implements, the, leibnizian, transcendental, law, of, homogeneity, leibniz, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, analysis, situs, later, used, in, the, 19th, century, to, refer, to, what, is, now, known, as, topology, there, are, two, takes, on, this, situation, on, the, one, hand, mates, citing, a, 1954, paper, in, german, by, jacob, freudenthal, argues, although, for, leibniz, the, situs, of, a, sequence, of, points, is, completely, determined, by, the, distance, between, them, and, is, altered, if, those, distances, are, altered, his, admirer, euler, in, the, famous, 1736, paper, solving, the, k, nigsberg, bridge, problem, and, its, generalizations, used, the, term, geometria, situs, in, such, a, sense, that, the, situs, remains, unchanged, under, topological, deformations, he, mistakenly, credits, leibniz, with, originating, this, concept, is, sometimes, not, realized, that, leibniz, used, the, term, in, an, entirely, different, sense, and, hence, can, hardly, be, considered, the, founder, of, that, part, of, mathematics, but, hideaki, hirano, argues, differently, quoting, mandelbrot, to, sample, leibniz, scientific, works, is, a, sobering, experience, next, to, calculus, and, to, other, thoughts, that, have, been, carried, out, to, completion, the, number, and, variety, of, premonitory, thrusts, is, overwhelming, we, saw, examples, in, packing, my, leibniz, mania, is, further, reinforced, by, finding, that, for, one, moment, its, hero, attached, importance, to, geometric, scaling, in, euclidis, prota, which, is, an, attempt, to, tighten, euclid, s, axioms, he, states, i, have, diverse, definitions, for, the, straight, line, the, straight, line, is, a, curve, any, part, of, which, is, similar, to, the, whole, and, it, alone, has, this, property, not, only, among, curves, but, among, sets, this, claim, can, be, proved, today, thus, the, fractal, geometry, promoted, by, mandelbrot, drew, on, leibniz, s, notions, of, self, similarity, and, the, principle, of, continuity, natura, non, facit, saltus, we, also, see, that, when, leibniz, wrote, in, a, metaphysical, vein, that, the, straight, line, is, a, curve, any, part, of, which, is, similar, to, the, whole, he, was, anticipating, topology, by, more, than, two, centuries, as, for, packing, leibniz, told, his, friend, and, correspondent, des, bosses, to, imagine, a, circle, then, to, inscribe, within, it, three, congruent, circles, with, maximum, radius, the, latter, smaller, circles, could, be, filled, with, three, even, smaller, circles, by, the, same, procedure, this, process, can, be, continued, infinitely, from, which, arises, a, good, idea, of, self, similarity, leibniz, s, improvement, of, euclid, s, axiom, contains, the, same, concept, leibniz, s, writings, are, currently, discussed, not, only, for, their, anticipations, and, possible, discoveries, not, yet, recognized, but, as, ways, of, advancing, present, knowledge, much, of, his, writing, on, physics, is, included, in, gerhardt, s, mathematical, writings, leibniz, contributed, a, fair, amount, to, the, statics, and, dynamics, emerging, around, him, often, disagreeing, with, descartes, and, newton, he, devised, a, new, theory, of, motion, dynamics, based, on, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, which, posited, space, as, relative, whereas, newton, was, thoroughly, convinced, that, space, was, absolute, an, important, example, of, leibniz, s, mature, physical, thinking, is, his, specimen, dynamicum, of, 1695, until, the, discovery, of, subatomic, particles, and, the, quantum, mechanics, governing, them, many, of, leibniz, s, speculative, ideas, about, aspects, of, nature, not, reducible, to, statics, and, dynamics, made, little, sense, for, instance, he, anticipated, albert, einstein, by, arguing, against, newton, that, space, time, and, motion, are, relative, not, absolute, as, for, my, own, opinion, i, have, said, more, than, once, that, i, hold, space, to, be, something, merely, relative, as, time, is, that, i, hold, it, to, be, an, order, of, coexistences, as, time, is, an, order, of, successions, leibniz, held, a, relational, notion, of, space, and, time, against, newton, s, substantivalist, views, according, to, newton, s, substantivalism, space, and, time, are, entities, in, their, own, right, existing, independently, of, things, leibniz, s, relationalism, in, contrast, describes, space, and, time, as, systems, of, relations, that, exist, between, objects, the, rise, of, general, relativity, and, subsequent, work, in, the, history, of, physics, has, put, leibniz, s, stance, in, a, more, favorable, light, one, of, leibniz, s, projects, was, to, recast, newton, s, theory, as, a, vortex, theory, however, his, project, went, beyond, vortex, theory, since, at, its, heart, there, was, an, attempt, to, explain, one, of, the, most, difficult, problems, in, physics, that, of, the, origin, of, the, cohesion, of, matter, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, has, been, invoked, in, recent, cosmology, and, his, identity, of, indiscernibles, in, quantum, mechanics, a, field, some, even, credit, him, with, having, anticipated, in, some, sense, in, addition, to, his, theories, about, the, nature, of, reality, leibniz, s, contributions, to, the, development, of, calculus, have, also, had, a, major, impact, on, physics, leibniz, s, vis, viva, latin, for, living, force, is, m, v, 2, twice, the, modern, kinetic, energy, he, realized, that, the, total, energy, would, be, conserved, in, certain, mechanical, systems, so, he, considered, it, an, innate, motive, characteristic, of, matter, here, too, his, thinking, gave, rise, to, another, regrettable, nationalistic, dispute, his, vis, viva, was, seen, as, rivaling, the, conservation, of, momentum, championed, by, newton, in, england, and, by, descartes, and, voltaire, in, france, hence, academics, in, those, countries, tended, to, neglect, leibniz, s, idea, leibniz, knew, of, the, validity, of, conservation, of, momentum, in, reality, both, energy, and, momentum, are, conserved, in, closed, systems, so, both, approaches, are, valid, by, proposing, that, the, earth, has, a, molten, core, he, anticipated, modern, geology, in, embryology, he, was, a, preformationist, but, also, proposed, that, organisms, are, the, outcome, of, a, combination, of, an, infinite, number, of, possible, microstructures, and, of, their, powers, in, the, life, sciences, and, paleontology, he, revealed, an, amazing, transformist, intuition, fueled, by, his, study, of, comparative, anatomy, and, fossils, one, of, his, principal, works, on, this, subject, protogaea, unpublished, in, his, lifetime, has, recently, been, published, in, english, for, the, first, time, he, worked, out, a, primal, organismic, theory, in, medicine, he, exhorted, the, physicians, of, his, time, with, some, results, to, ground, their, theories, in, detailed, comparative, observations, and, verified, experiments, and, to, distinguish, firmly, scientific, and, metaphysical, points, of, view, psychology, had, been, a, central, interest, of, leibniz, he, appears, to, be, an, underappreciated, pioneer, of, psychology, he, wrote, on, topics, which, are, now, regarded, as, fields, of, psychology, attention, and, consciousness, memory, learning, association, motivation, the, act, of, striving, emergent, individuality, the, general, dynamics, of, development, evolutionary, psychology, his, discussions, in, the, new, essays, and, monadology, often, rely, on, everyday, observations, such, as, the, behaviour, of, a, dog, or, the, noise, of, the, sea, and, he, develops, intuitive, analogies, the, synchronous, running, of, clocks, or, the, balance, spring, of, a, clock, he, also, devised, postulates, and, principles, that, apply, to, psychology, the, continuum, of, the, unnoticed, petites, perceptions, to, the, distinct, self, aware, apperception, and, psychophysical, parallelism, from, the, point, of, view, of, causality, and, of, purpose, souls, act, according, to, the, laws, of, final, causes, through, aspirations, ends, and, means, bodies, act, according, to, the, laws, of, efficient, causes, i, e, the, laws, of, motion, and, these, two, realms, that, of, efficient, causes, and, that, of, final, causes, harmonize, with, one, another, this, idea, refers, to, the, mind, body, problem, stating, that, the, mind, and, brain, do, not, act, upon, each, other, but, act, alongside, each, other, separately, but, in, harmony, leibniz, however, did, not, use, the, term, psychologia, leibniz, s, epistemological, position, against, john, locke, and, english, empiricism, sensualism, was, made, clear, nihil, est, in, intellectu, quod, non, fuerit, in, sensu, nisi, intellectu, ipse, nothing, is, in, the, intellect, that, was, not, first, in, the, senses, except, the, intellect, itself, principles, that, are, not, present, in, sensory, impressions, can, be, recognised, in, human, perception, and, consciousness, logical, inferences, categories, of, thought, the, principle, of, causality, and, the, principle, of, purpose, teleology, leibniz, found, his, most, important, interpreter, in, wilhelm, wundt, founder, of, psychology, as, a, discipline, wundt, used, the, nisi, intellectu, ipse, quotation, 1862, on, the, title, page, of, his, beitr, ge, zur, theorie, der, sinneswahrnehmung, contributions, on, the, theory, of, sensory, perception, and, published, a, detailed, and, aspiring, monograph, on, leibniz, wundt, shaped, the, term, apperception, introduced, by, leibniz, into, an, experimental, psychologically, based, apperception, psychology, that, included, neuropsychological, modelling, an, excellent, example, of, how, a, concept, created, by, a, great, philosopher, could, stimulate, a, psychological, research, program, one, principle, in, the, thinking, of, leibniz, played, a, fundamental, role, the, principle, of, equality, of, separate, but, corresponding, viewpoints, wundt, characterized, this, style, of, thought, perspectivism, in, a, way, that, also, applied, for, him, viewpoints, that, supplement, one, another, while, also, being, able, to, appear, as, opposites, that, only, resolve, themselves, when, considered, more, deeply, much, of, leibniz, s, work, went, on, to, have, a, great, impact, on, the, field, of, psychology, leibniz, thought, that, there, are, many, petites, perceptions, or, small, perceptions, of, which, we, perceive, but, of, which, we, are, unaware, he, believed, that, by, the, principle, that, phenomena, found, in, nature, were, continuous, by, default, it, was, likely, that, the, transition, between, conscious, and, unconscious, states, had, intermediary, steps, for, this, to, be, true, there, must, also, be, a, portion, of, the, mind, of, which, we, are, unaware, at, any, given, time, his, theory, regarding, consciousness, in, relation, to, the, principle, of, continuity, can, be, seen, as, an, early, theory, regarding, the, stages, of, sleep, in, this, way, leibniz, s, theory, of, perception, can, be, viewed, as, one, of, many, theories, leading, up, to, the, idea, of, the, unconscious, leibniz, was, a, direct, influence, on, ernst, platner, who, is, credited, with, originally, coining, the, term, unbewu, tseyn, unconscious, additionally, the, idea, of, subliminal, stimuli, can, be, traced, back, to, his, theory, of, small, perceptions, leibniz, s, ideas, regarding, music, and, tonal, perception, went, on, to, influence, the, laboratory, studies, of, wilhelm, wundt, in, public, health, he, advocated, establishing, a, medical, administrative, authority, with, powers, over, epidemiology, and, veterinary, medicine, he, worked, to, set, up, a, coherent, medical, training, program, oriented, towards, public, health, and, preventive, measures, in, economic, policy, he, proposed, tax, reforms, and, a, national, insurance, program, and, discussed, the, balance, of, trade, he, even, proposed, something, akin, to, what, much, later, emerged, as, game, theory, in, sociology, he, laid, the, ground, for, communication, theory, in, 1906, garland, published, a, volume, of, leibniz, s, writings, bearing, on, his, many, practical, inventions, and, engineering, work, to, date, few, of, these, writings, have, been, translated, into, english, nevertheless, it, is, well, understood, that, leibniz, was, a, serious, inventor, engineer, and, applied, scientist, with, great, respect, for, practical, life, following, the, motto, theoria, cum, praxi, he, urged, that, theory, be, combined, with, practical, application, and, thus, has, been, claimed, as, the, father, of, applied, science, he, designed, wind, driven, propellers, and, water, pumps, mining, machines, to, extract, ore, hydraulic, presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc, with, denis, papin, he, created, a, steam, engine, he, even, proposed, a, method, for, desalinating, water, from, 1680, to, 1685, he, struggled, to, overcome, the, chronic, flooding, that, afflicted, the, ducal, silver, mines, in, the, harz, mountains, but, did, not, succeed, leibniz, may, have, been, the, first, computer, scientist, and, information, theorist, early, in, life, he, documented, the, binary, numeral, system, base, 2, then, revisited, that, system, throughout, his, career, while, leibniz, was, examining, other, cultures, to, compare, his, metaphysical, views, he, encountered, an, ancient, chinese, book, i, ching, leibniz, interpreted, a, diagram, which, showed, yin, and, yang, and, corresponded, it, to, a, zero, and, one, more, information, can, be, found, in, the, sinophology, section, leibniz, had, similarities, with, juan, caramuel, y, lobkowitz, and, thomas, harriot, who, independently, developed, the, binary, system, as, he, was, familiar, with, their, works, on, the, binary, system, juan, caramuel, y, lobkowitz, worked, extensively, on, logarithms, including, logarithms, with, base, 2, thomas, harriot, s, manuscripts, contained, a, table, of, binary, numbers, and, their, notation, which, demonstrated, that, any, number, could, be, written, on, a, base, 2, system, regardless, leibniz, simplified, the, binary, system, and, articulated, logical, properties, such, as, conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and, the, empty, set, he, anticipated, lagrangian, interpolation, and, algorithmic, information, theory, his, calculus, ratiocinator, anticipated, aspects, of, the, universal, turing, machine, in, 1961, norbert, wiener, suggested, that, leibniz, should, be, considered, the, patron, saint, of, cybernetics, wiener, is, quoted, with, indeed, the, general, idea, of, a, computing, machine, is, nothing, but, a, mechanization, of, leibniz, s, calculus, ratiocinator, in, 1671, leibniz, began, to, invent, a, machine, that, could, execute, all, four, arithmetic, operations, gradually, improving, it, over, a, number, of, years, this, stepped, reckoner, attracted, fair, attention, and, was, the, basis, of, his, election, to, the, royal, society, in, 1673, a, number, of, such, machines, were, made, during, his, years, in, hanover, by, a, craftsman, working, under, his, supervision, they, were, not, an, unambiguous, success, because, they, did, not, fully, mechanize, the, carry, operation, couturat, reported, finding, an, unpublished, note, by, leibniz, dated, 1674, describing, a, machine, capable, of, performing, some, algebraic, operations, leibniz, also, devised, a, now, reproduced, cipher, machine, recovered, by, nicholas, rescher, in, 2010, in, 1693, leibniz, described, a, design, of, a, machine, which, could, in, theory, integrate, differential, equations, which, he, called, integraph, leibniz, was, groping, towards, hardware, and, software, concepts, worked, out, much, later, by, charles, babbage, and, ada, lovelace, in, 1679, while, mulling, over, his, binary, arithmetic, leibniz, imagined, a, machine, in, which, binary, numbers, were, represented, by, marbles, governed, by, a, rudimentary, sort, of, punched, cards, modern, electronic, digital, computers, replace, leibniz, s, marbles, moving, by, gravity, with, shift, registers, voltage, gradients, and, pulses, of, electrons, but, otherwise, they, run, roughly, as, leibniz, envisioned, in, 1679, later, in, leibniz, s, career, after, the, death, of, von, boyneburg, leibniz, moved, to, paris, and, accepted, a, position, as, a, librarian, in, the, hanoverian, court, of, johann, friedrich, duke, of, brunswick, luneburg, leibniz, s, predecessor, tobias, fleischer, had, already, created, a, cataloging, system, for, the, duke, s, library, but, it, was, a, clumsy, attempt, at, this, library, leibniz, focused, more, on, advancing, the, library, than, on, the, cataloging, for, instance, within, a, month, of, taking, the, new, position, he, developed, a, comprehensive, plan, to, expand, the, library, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, consider, developing, a, core, collection, for, a, library, and, felt, that, a, library, for, display, and, ostentation, is, a, luxury, and, indeed, superfluous, but, a, well, stocked, and, organized, library, is, important, and, useful, for, all, areas, of, human, endeavor, and, is, to, be, regarded, on, the, same, level, as, schools, and, churches, leibniz, lacked, the, funds, to, develop, the, library, in, this, manner, after, working, at, this, library, by, the, end, of, 1690, leibniz, was, appointed, as, privy, councilor, and, librarian, of, the, bibliotheca, augusta, at, wolfenb, ttel, it, was, an, extensive, library, with, at, least, 25, 946, printed, volumes, at, this, library, leibniz, sought, to, improve, the, catalog, he, was, not, allowed, to, make, complete, changes, to, the, existing, closed, catalog, but, was, allowed, to, improve, upon, it, so, he, started, on, that, task, immediately, he, created, an, alphabetical, author, catalog, and, had, also, created, other, cataloging, methods, that, were, not, implemented, while, serving, as, librarian, of, the, ducal, libraries, in, hanover, and, wolfenb, ttel, leibniz, effectively, became, one, of, the, founders, of, library, science, seemingly, leibniz, paid, a, good, deal, of, attention, to, the, classification, of, subject, matter, favoring, a, well, balanced, library, covering, a, host, of, numerous, subjects, and, interests, leibniz, for, example, proposed, the, following, classification, system, in, the, otivm, hanoveranvm, sive, miscellanea, 1737, he, also, designed, a, book, indexing, system, in, ignorance, of, the, only, other, such, system, then, extant, that, of, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, university, he, also, called, on, publishers, to, distribute, abstracts, of, all, new, titles, they, produced, each, year, in, a, standard, form, that, would, facilitate, indexing, he, hoped, that, this, abstracting, project, would, eventually, include, everything, printed, from, his, day, back, to, gutenberg, neither, proposal, met, with, success, at, the, time, but, something, like, them, became, standard, practice, among, english, language, publishers, during, the, 20th, century, under, the, aegis, of, the, library, of, congress, and, the, british, library, he, called, for, the, creation, of, an, empirical, database, as, a, way, to, further, all, sciences, his, characteristica, universalis, calculus, ratiocinator, and, a, community, of, minds, intended, among, other, things, to, bring, political, and, religious, unity, to, europe, can, be, seen, as, distant, unwitting, anticipations, of, artificial, languages, e, g, esperanto, and, its, rivals, symbolic, logic, even, the, world, wide, web, leibniz, emphasized, that, research, was, a, collaborative, endeavor, hence, he, warmly, advocated, the, formation, of, national, scientific, societies, along, the, lines, of, the, british, royal, society, and, the, french, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, more, specifically, in, his, correspondence, and, travels, he, urged, the, creation, of, such, societies, in, dresden, saint, petersburg, vienna, and, berlin, only, one, such, project, came, to, fruition, in, 1700, the, berlin, academy, of, sciences, was, created, leibniz, drew, up, its, first, statutes, and, served, as, its, first, president, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, that, academy, evolved, into, the, german, academy, of, sciences, the, publisher, of, the, ongoing, critical, edition, of, his, works, leibniz, s, writings, on, law, ethics, and, politics, were, long, overlooked, by, english, speaking, scholars, but, this, has, changed, of, late, while, leibniz, was, no, apologist, for, absolute, monarchy, like, hobbes, or, for, tyranny, in, any, form, neither, did, he, echo, the, political, and, constitutional, views, of, his, contemporary, john, locke, views, invoked, in, support, of, liberalism, in, 18th, century, america, and, later, elsewhere, the, following, excerpt, from, a, 1695, letter, to, baron, j, c, boyneburg, s, son, philipp, is, very, revealing, of, leibniz, s, political, sentiments, as, for, the, great, question, of, the, power, of, sovereigns, and, the, obedience, their, peoples, owe, them, i, usually, say, that, it, would, be, good, for, princes, to, be, persuaded, that, their, people, have, the, right, to, resist, them, and, for, the, people, on, the, other, hand, to, be, persuaded, to, obey, them, passively, i, am, however, quite, of, the, opinion, of, grotius, that, one, ought, to, obey, as, a, rule, the, evil, of, revolution, being, greater, beyond, comparison, than, the, evils, causing, it, yet, i, recognize, that, a, prince, can, go, to, such, excess, and, place, the, well, being, of, the, state, in, such, danger, that, the, obligation, to, endure, ceases, this, is, most, rare, however, and, the, theologian, who, authorizes, violence, under, this, pretext, should, take, care, against, excess, excess, being, infinitely, more, dangerous, than, deficiency, in, 1677, leibniz, called, for, a, european, confederation, governed, by, a, council, or, senate, whose, members, would, represent, entire, nations, and, would, be, free, to, vote, their, consciences, this, is, sometimes, considered, an, anticipation, of, the, european, union, he, believed, that, europe, would, adopt, a, uniform, religion, he, reiterated, these, proposals, in, 1715, but, at, the, same, time, he, arrived, to, propose, an, interreligious, and, multicultural, project, to, create, a, universal, system, of, justice, which, required, from, him, a, broad, interdisciplinary, perspective, in, order, to, propose, it, he, combined, linguistics, especially, sinology, moral, and, legal, philosophy, management, economics, and, politics, leibniz, trained, as, a, legal, academic, but, under, the, tutelage, of, cartesian, sympathiser, erhard, weigel, we, already, see, an, attempt, to, solve, legal, problems, by, rationalist, mathematical, methods, weigel, s, influence, being, most, explicit, in, the, specimen, quaestionum, philosophicarum, ex, jure, collectarum, an, essay, of, collected, philosophical, problems, of, right, for, example, the, inaugural, disputation, on, perplexing, cases, uses, early, combinatorics, to, solve, some, legal, disputes, while, the, 1666, dissertation, on, the, combinatorial, art, includes, simple, legal, problems, by, way, of, illustration, the, use, of, combinatorial, methods, to, solve, legal, and, moral, problems, seems, via, athanasius, kircher, and, daniel, schwenter, to, be, of, llullist, inspiration, ram, n, llull, attempted, to, solve, ecumenical, disputes, through, recourse, to, a, combinatorial, mode, of, reasoning, he, regarded, as, universal, a, mathesis, universalis, in, the, late, 1660s, the, enlightened, prince, bishop, of, mainz, johann, philipp, von, sch, nborn, announced, a, review, of, the, legal, system, and, made, available, a, position, to, support, his, current, law, commissioner, leibniz, left, franconia, and, made, for, mainz, before, even, winning, the, role, on, reaching, frankfurt, am, main, leibniz, penned, the, new, method, of, teaching, and, learning, the, law, by, way, of, application, the, text, proposed, a, reform, of, legal, education, and, is, characteristically, syncretic, integrating, aspects, of, thomism, hobbesianism, cartesianism, and, traditional, jurisprudence, leibniz, s, argument, that, the, function, of, legal, teaching, was, not, to, impress, rules, as, one, might, train, a, dog, but, to, aid, the, student, in, discovering, their, own, public, reason, evidently, impressed, von, sch, nborn, as, he, secured, the, job, leibniz, s, next, major, attempt, to, find, a, universal, rational, core, to, law, and, so, found, a, legal, science, of, right, came, when, leibniz, worked, in, mainz, from, 1667, 72, starting, initially, from, hobbes, mechanistic, doctrine, of, power, leibniz, reverted, to, logico, combinatorial, methods, in, an, attempt, to, define, justice, as, leibniz, s, so, called, elementa, juris, naturalis, advanced, he, built, in, modal, notions, of, right, possibility, and, obligation, necessity, in, which, we, see, perhaps, the, earliest, elaboration, of, his, possible, worlds, doctrine, within, a, deontic, frame, while, ultimately, the, elementa, remained, unpublished, leibniz, continued, to, work, on, his, drafts, and, promote, their, ideas, to, correspondents, up, until, his, death, leibniz, devoted, considerable, intellectual, and, diplomatic, effort, to, what, would, now, be, called, an, ecumenical, endeavor, seeking, to, reconcile, the, roman, catholic, and, lutheran, churches, in, this, respect, he, followed, the, example, of, his, early, patrons, baron, von, boyneburg, and, the, duke, john, frederick, both, cradle, lutherans, who, converted, to, catholicism, as, adults, who, did, what, they, could, to, encourage, the, reunion, of, the, two, faiths, and, who, warmly, welcomed, such, endeavors, by, others, the, house, of, brunswick, remained, lutheran, because, the, duke, s, children, did, not, follow, their, father, these, efforts, included, corresponding, with, french, bishop, jacques, b, nigne, bossuet, and, involved, leibniz, in, some, theological, controversy, he, evidently, thought, that, the, thoroughgoing, application, of, reason, would, suffice, to, heal, the, breach, caused, by, the, reformation, leibniz, the, philologist, was, an, avid, student, of, languages, eagerly, latching, on, to, any, information, about, vocabulary, and, grammar, that, came, his, way, in, 1710, he, applied, ideas, of, gradualism, and, uniformitarianism, to, linguistics, in, a, short, essay, he, refuted, the, belief, widely, held, by, christian, scholars, of, the, time, that, hebrew, was, the, primeval, language, of, the, human, race, at, the, same, time, he, rejected, the, idea, of, unrelated, language, groups, and, considered, them, all, to, have, a, common, source, he, also, refuted, the, argument, advanced, by, swedish, scholars, in, his, day, that, a, form, of, proto, swedish, was, the, ancestor, of, the, germanic, languages, he, puzzled, over, the, origins, of, the, slavic, languages, and, was, fascinated, by, classical, chinese, leibniz, was, also, an, expert, in, the, sanskrit, language, he, published, the, princeps, editio, first, modern, edition, of, the, late, medieval, chronicon, holtzatiae, a, latin, chronicle, of, the, county, of, holstein, leibniz, was, perhaps, the, first, major, european, intellectual, to, take, a, close, interest, in, chinese, civilization, which, he, knew, by, corresponding, with, and, reading, other, works, by, european, christian, missionaries, posted, in, china, he, apparently, read, confucius, sinarum, philosophus, in, the, first, year, of, its, publication, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, europeans, could, learn, much, from, the, confucian, ethical, tradition, he, mulled, over, the, possibility, that, the, chinese, characters, were, an, unwitting, form, of, his, universal, characteristic, he, noted, how, the, i, ching, hexagrams, correspond, to, the, binary, numbers, from, 000000, to, 111111, and, concluded, that, this, mapping, was, evidence, of, major, chinese, accomplishments, in, the, sort, of, philosophical, mathematics, he, admired, leibniz, communicated, his, ideas, of, the, binary, system, representing, christianity, to, the, emperor, of, china, hoping, it, would, convert, him, leibniz, was, one, of, the, western, philosophers, of, the, time, who, attempted, to, accommodate, confucian, ideas, to, prevailing, european, beliefs, leibniz, s, attraction, to, chinese, philosophy, originates, from, his, perception, that, chinese, philosophy, was, similar, to, his, own, the, historian, e, r, hughes, suggests, that, leibniz, s, ideas, of, simple, substance, and, pre, established, harmony, were, directly, influenced, by, confucianism, pointing, to, the, fact, that, they, were, conceived, during, the, period, when, he, was, reading, confucius, sinarum, philosophus, while, making, his, grand, tour, of, european, archives, to, research, the, brunswick, family, history, that, he, never, completed, leibniz, stopped, in, vienna, between, may, 1688, and, february, 1689, where, he, did, much, legal, and, diplomatic, work, for, the, brunswicks, he, visited, mines, talked, with, mine, engineers, and, tried, to, negotiate, export, contracts, for, lead, from, the, ducal, mines, in, the, harz, mountains, his, proposal, that, the, streets, of, vienna, be, lit, with, lamps, burning, rapeseed, oil, was, implemented, during, a, formal, audience, with, the, austrian, emperor, and, in, subsequent, memoranda, he, advocated, reorganizing, the, austrian, economy, reforming, the, coinage, of, much, of, central, europe, negotiating, a, concordat, between, the,
