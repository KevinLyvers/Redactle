the, arabic, honorific, as, sayyid, the, lord, or, the, master, which, would, evolve, into, el, id, spanish, old, spanish, and, the, spanish, honorific, el, campeador, the, master, of, the, battlefield, he, was, born, in, vivar, a, village, near, the, city, of, burgos, as, the, head, of, his, loyal, knights, he, came, to, dominate, the, levante, of, the, iberian, peninsula, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, he, reclaimed, the, taifa, of, valencia, from, moorish, control, for, a, brief, period, during, the, reconquista, ruling, the, principality, as, its, lord, from, 17, june, 1094, until, his, death, in, 1099, his, wife, jimena, d, az, inherited, the, city, and, maintained, it, until, 1102, when, it, was, reconquered, by, the, moors, d, az, de, vivar, became, well, known, for, his, service, in, the, armies, of, both, christian, and, muslim, rulers, after, his, death, el, cid, became, spain, s, most, celebrated, national, hero, and, the, protagonist, of, the, most, significant, medieval, spanish, epic, poem, el, cantar, de, mio, cid, which, presents, him, as, the, ideal, medieval, knight, strong, valiant, loyal, just, and, pious, there, are, various, theories, on, his, family, history, which, remains, uncertain, however, he, was, the, grandfather, of, garc, a, ram, rez, de, pamplona, king, of, navarre, the, first, son, of, his, daughter, cristina, rodr, guez, to, this, day, el, cid, remains, a, popular, spanish, folk, hero, and, national, icon, with, his, life, and, deeds, remembered, in, popular, culture, rodrigo, d, az, was, recognized, with, the, honorary, title, of, campeador, during, his, lifetime, as, is, evidenced, by, a, document, that, he, signed, in, 1098, which, he, signed, in, the, latinized, expression, ego, rudericus, campidoctor, the, title, campeador, thus, comes, from, the, latin, campidoctor, literally, meaning, teacher, of, the, field, but, translatable, as, master, of, the, battlefield, arabic, sources, from, the, late, 11th, century, and, early, 12th, century, call, him, al, kanb, r, al, qanb, r, also, preceded, by, rudr, q, or, ludr, q, which, are, arabized, forms, of, his, title, and, name, respectively, the, epithet, of, el, cid, meant, the, lord, probably, from, the, original, arabic, arabic, romanized, as, sayyid, and, was, a, title, given, to, other, christian, leaders, it, has, been, conjectured, that, rodrigo, d, az, received, the, honorific, title, and, respectful, treatment, of, contemporaries, in, zaragoza, because, of, his, victories, in, the, service, of, the, king, of, the, taifa, of, zaragoza, between, 1081, and, 1086, however, he, more, likely, received, the, epithet, after, his, conquest, of, valencia, in, 1094, this, title, appears, for, the, first, time, as, meo, idi, in, the, poema, de, almer, a, composed, between, 1147, and, 1149, the, combination, of, cid, campeador, is, documented, from, 1195, in, linaje, de, rodrigo, d, az, the, lineage, of, rodrigo, d, az, in, navarro, aragonese, which, form, part, of, the, liber, regum, written, as, mio, cit, el, campiador, and, in, el, cantar, de, mio, cid, born, a, member, of, the, minor, nobility, el, cid, was, brought, up, at, the, court, of, ferdinand, the, great, and, served, ferdinand, s, son, sancho, ii, of, le, n, and, castile, he, rose, to, become, the, commander, and, royal, standard, bearer, armiger, regis, of, castile, upon, sancho, s, ascension, in, 1065, el, cid, went, on, to, lead, the, castilian, military, campaigns, against, sancho, s, brothers, alfonso, vi, of, le, n, and, garc, a, ii, of, galicia, as, well, as, in, the, muslim, kingdoms, in, al, andalus, he, became, renowned, for, his, military, prowess, in, these, campaigns, which, helped, expand, the, territory, of, the, crown, of, castile, at, the, expense, of, the, muslims, and, sancho, s, brothers, kingdoms, when, conspirators, murdered, sancho, in, 1072, el, cid, found, himself, in, a, difficult, situation, since, sancho, was, childless, the, throne, passed, to, his, brother, alfonso, whom, el, cid, had, helped, remove, from, power, although, el, cid, continued, to, serve, the, sovereign, he, lost, his, ranking, in, the, new, court, which, treated, him, suspiciously, and, kept, him, at, arm, s, length, finally, in, 1081, he, was, exiled, el, cid, found, work, fighting, for, the, muslim, rulers, of, zaragoza, whom, he, defended, from, its, traditional, enemy, aragon, while, in, exile, he, regained, his, reputation, as, a, strategist, and, formidable, military, leader, he, was, repeatedly, victorious, in, battle, against, the, muslim, rulers, of, l, rida, and, their, christian, allies, as, well, as, against, a, large, christian, army, under, king, sancho, ram, rez, of, aragon, in, 1086, an, expeditionary, army, of, north, african, almoravids, inflicted, a, severe, defeat, to, castile, compelling, alfonso, to, overcome, the, resentment, he, harboured, against, el, cid, the, terms, for, el, cid, s, return, to, christian, service, must, have, been, attractive, enough, since, el, cid, soon, found, himself, fighting, for, his, former, lord, over, the, next, several, years, however, el, cid, set, his, sights, on, the, kingdom, city, of, valencia, operating, more, or, less, independently, of, alfonso, while, politically, supporting, the, banu, hud, and, other, muslim, dynasties, opposed, to, the, almoravids, he, gradually, increased, his, control, over, valencia, the, islamic, ruler, yahya, al, qadir, became, his, tributary, in, 1092, when, the, almoravids, instigated, an, uprising, that, resulted, in, the, death, of, al, qadir, el, cid, responded, by, laying, siege, to, the, city, valencia, finally, fell, in, 1094, and, el, cid, established, an, independent, principality, on, the, mediterranean, coast, of, iberia, he, ruled, over, a, pluralistic, society, with, the, popular, support, of, christians, and, muslims, alike, el, cid, s, final, years, were, spent, fighting, the, almoravid, berbers, he, inflicted, upon, them, their, first, major, defeat, in, 1094, on, the, plains, of, caurte, outside, valencia, and, continued, opposing, them, until, his, death, although, el, cid, remained, undefeated, in, valencia, diego, rodr, guez, his, only, son, and, heir, died, fighting, against, the, almoravids, in, the, service, of, alfonso, in, 1097, after, el, cid, s, death, in, 1099, his, wife, jimena, d, az, succeeded, him, as, ruler, of, valencia, but, she, was, eventually, forced, to, surrender, the, principality, to, the, almoravids, in, 1102, the, name, el, cid, spanish, is, a, modern, spanish, denomination, composed, of, the, article, el, meaning, the, and, cid, which, derives, from, the, old, castilian, loan, word, id, borrowed, from, the, dialectal, arabic, word, s, di, or, sayyid, which, means, lord, or, master, the, mozarabs, or, the, arabs, that, served, in, his, ranks, may, have, addressed, him, in, this, way, which, the, christians, may, have, transliterated, and, adopted, historians, however, have, not, yet, found, contemporary, records, referring, to, rodrigo, as, cid, arab, sources, use, instead, rudriq, ludriq, al, kanbiyatur, or, al, qanbiyatur, rodrigo, el, campeador, the, cognomen, campeador, derives, from, latin, campi, doctor, which, means, battlefield, master, he, probably, gained, it, during, the, campaigns, of, king, sancho, ii, of, castile, against, his, brothers, kings, alfonso, vi, of, le, n, and, garc, a, ii, of, galicia, while, his, contemporaries, left, no, historical, sources, that, would, have, addressed, him, as, cid, they, left, plenty, of, christian, and, arab, records, some, even, signed, documents, with, his, autograph, addressing, him, as, campeador, which, prove, that, he, used, the, christian, cognomen, himself, the, whole, combination, cid, campeador, is, first, documented, c, 1195, in, the, navarro, aragonese, linage, de, rodric, d, az, included, in, the, liber, regum, under, the, formula, mio, cid, el, campeador, el, cid, was, born, rodrigo, d, az, circa, 1043, in, vivar, also, known, as, castillona, de, bivar, a, small, town, about, ten, kilometers, or, six, miles, north, of, burgos, the, capital, of, castile, his, father, diego, la, nez, was, a, courtier, bureaucrat, and, cavalryman, who, had, fought, in, several, battles, despite, the, fact, that, el, cid, s, mother, s, family, was, aristocratic, in, later, years, the, peasants, would, consider, him, one, of, their, own, however, his, relatives, were, not, major, court, officials, documents, show, that, el, cid, s, paternal, grandfather, la, n, confirmed, only, five, documents, of, ferdinand, i, s, his, maternal, grandfather, rodrigo, lvarez, certified, only, two, of, sancho, ii, s, and, el, cid, s, father, confirmed, only, one, as, a, young, man, in, 1057, el, cid, fought, against, the, moorish, stronghold, of, zaragoza, making, its, emir, al, muqtadir, a, vassal, of, sancho, in, the, spring, of, 1063, el, cid, fought, in, the, battle, of, graus, where, ferdinand, s, half, brother, ramiro, i, of, aragon, was, laying, siege, to, the, moorish, town, of, graus, which, was, fought, on, zaragozan, lands, in, the, valley, of, the, river, cinca, al, muqtadir, accompanied, by, castilian, troops, including, el, cid, fought, against, the, aragonese, the, party, slew, ramiro, i, setting, the, aragonese, army, on, the, run, and, emerged, victorious, one, legend, has, said, that, during, the, conflict, el, cid, killed, an, aragonese, knight, in, single, combat, thereby, receiving, the, honorific, title, campeador, when, ferdinand, died, sancho, continued, to, enlarge, his, territory, conquering, both, christian, strongholds, and, the, moorish, cities, of, zamora, and, badajoz, when, sancho, learned, that, alfonso, was, planning, on, overthrowing, him, in, order, to, gain, his, territory, sancho, sent, cid, to, bring, alfonso, back, so, that, sancho, could, speak, to, him, sancho, was, assassinated, in, 1072, during, a, siege, of, his, sister, s, town, of, zamora, since, sancho, died, unmarried, and, childless, all, of, his, power, passed, to, his, brother, alfonso, who, almost, immediately, returned, from, exile, in, toledo, and, took, his, seat, as, king, of, castile, and, le, n, he, was, however, deeply, suspected, of, having, been, involved, in, sancho, s, murder, according, to, the, 11th, century, epic, poem, cantar, de, mio, cid, the, castilian, nobility, led, by, el, cid, and, a, dozen, oath, helpers, forced, alfonso, to, swear, publicly, on, holy, relics, multiple, times, in, front, of, santa, gadea, saint, agatha, church, in, burgos, that, he, did, not, participate, in, the, plot, to, kill, his, brother, this, is, not, mentioned, in, the, more, reliable, 12th, century, chronicle, historia, roderici, however, el, cid, s, position, as, armiger, regis, was, taken, away, and, given, to, his, enemy, count, garc, a, ord, ez, in, 1079, el, cid, was, sent, by, alfonso, vi, to, seville, to, the, court, of, al, mutamid, to, collect, the, parias, owed, by, that, taifa, to, le, n, castile, while, he, was, there, granada, assisted, by, other, castilian, knights, attacked, seville, and, el, cid, and, his, forces, repulsed, the, christian, and, grenadine, attackers, at, the, battle, of, cabra, in, the, probably, mistaken, belief, that, he, was, defending, the, king, s, tributary, during, the, aftermath, of, this, battle, the, muslim, troops, under, el, cid, s, command, would, hail, him, as, sayyidi, count, garc, a, ord, ez, and, the, other, castilian, leaders, were, taken, captive, and, held, for, three, days, before, being, released, in, the, battle, of, cabra, 1079, el, cid, rallied, his, troops, and, turned, the, battle, into, a, rout, of, emir, abdullah, of, granada, and, his, ally, garc, a, ord, ez, this, unauthorized, expedition, into, granada, however, greatly, angered, alfonso, and, may, 8, 1080, was, the, last, time, el, cid, confirmed, a, document, in, king, alfonso, s, court, the, most, likely, reason, was, el, cid, s, incursion, into, toledo, which, happened, to, be, under, the, control, of, alfonso, s, vassal, yahya, al, qadir, alfonso, s, anger, over, el, cid, s, unsanctioned, incursion, into, his, vassal, s, territory, would, lead, him, to, exile, the, knight, this, is, the, generally, accepted, reason, for, the, exile, of, el, cid, although, several, others, are, plausible, and, indeed, may, have, been, contributing, factors, to, the, exile, jealous, nobles, turning, alfonso, against, el, cid, through, court, intrigue, and, alfonso, s, own, personal, animosity, towards, el, cid, the, song, of, el, cid, and, subsequent, tales, state, that, alfonso, s, and, his, court, s, animosity, toward, rodrigo, was, the, primary, reason, the, expulsion, of, the, knights, from, le, n, as, well, as, a, possible, misappropriation, of, some, of, the, tribute, from, seville, by, el, cid, at, first, he, went, to, barcelona, where, ramon, berenguer, ii, refused, his, offer, of, service, the, exile, was, not, the, end, of, el, cid, either, physically, or, as, an, important, figure, after, being, rejected, by, ramon, berenguer, ii, el, cid, journeyed, to, the, taifa, of, zaragoza, where, he, received, a, warmer, welcome, in, 1081, el, cid, went, on, to, offer, his, services, to, the, king, of, zaragoza, yusuf, al, mu, taman, ibn, hud, and, served, both, him, and, his, successor, al, musta, in, ii, he, was, given, the, title, el, cid, the, master, and, served, as, a, leading, figure, in, a, diverse, moorish, force, consisting, of, muwallads, berbers, arabs, and, malians, within, the, respective, taifa, according, to, moorish, accounts, andalusi, knights, found, el, cid, their, foe, ill, thirsty, and, exiled, from, the, court, of, alfonso, he, was, presented, before, the, elderly, yusuf, al, mu, taman, ibn, hud, and, accepted, command, of, the, forces, of, the, taifa, of, zaragoza, as, their, master, in, his, history, of, medieval, spain, cornell, university, press, 1975, joseph, f, o, callaghan, writes, that, kingdom, was, divided, between, al, mutamin, 1081, 1085, who, ruled, zaragoza, proper, and, his, brother, al, mundhir, who, ruled, l, rida, and, tortosa, el, cid, entered, al, mutamin, s, service, and, successfully, defended, zaragoza, against, the, assaults, of, al, mundhir, sancho, i, of, arag, n, and, ramon, berenguer, ii, whom, he, held, captive, briefly, in, 1082, in, 1082, the, army, of, the, taifa, of,

alfonso, recalled, el, cid, rewarding, him, lavishly, with, lands, and, lordships, such, as, the, fortress, of, gormaz, in, the, year, 1087, alfonso, sent, him, to, negotiate, with, the, emboldened, taifa, kingdoms, el, cid, returned, to, alfonso, but, now, he, had, his, own, plans, he, only, stayed, a, short, while, and, then, returned, to, zaragoza, el, cid, was, content, to, let, the, almoravid, armies, and, the, armies, of, alfonso, fight, without, his, help, even, when, there, was, a, chance, that, the, almoravids, might, defeat, alfonso, and, take, over, all, of, alfonso, s, lands, el, cid, chose, not, to, fight, because, he, was, hoping, that, both, armies, would, weaken, themselves, around, this, time, el, cid, with, a, combined, christian, and, moorish, army, began, maneuvering, in, order, to, create, his, own, fief, in, the, moorish, mediterranean, coastal, city, of, valencia, several, obstacles, lay, in, his, way, first, was, berenguer, ramon, ii, who, ruled,

served, in, the, army, and, as, administrators, jerome, of, p, rigord, was, made, bishop, el, cid, and, his, wife, jimena, d, az, lived, peacefully, in, valencia, until, the, almoravids, besieged, the, city, but, he, defeated, them, and, died, 5, years, later, on, july, 10, 1099, afterward, valencia, was, captured, by, mazdali, on, may, 5, 1102, jimena, fled, to, burgos, castile, in, 1101, she, rode, into, the, town, with, her, retinue, and, the, body, of, el, cid, originally, buried, in, castile, in, the, monastery, of, san, pedro, de, carde, a, his, body, now, lies, at, the, center, of, burgos, cathedral, after, his, demise, but, still, during, the, siege, of, valencia, legend, holds, that, jimena, ordered, that, the, corpse, of, el, cid, be, fitted, with, his, armor, and, set, on, his, horse, babieca, to, bolster, the, morale, of, his, troops, in, several, variations, of, the, story, the, dead, rodrigo, and, his, knights, win, a, thundering, charge, against, valencia, s, besiegers, resulting, in, a, war, is, lost, but, battle, is, won, catharsis, for, generations, of, christian, spaniards, to, follow, it, is, believed, that, the, legend, originated, shortly, after, jimena, entered, burgos, and, that, it, is, derived, from, the, manner, in, which, jimena, s, procession, rode, into, the, city, i, e, alongside, her, deceased, husband, during, his, campaigns, el, cid, often, ordered, that, books, by, classic, roman, and, greek, authors, on, military, themes, be, read, aloud, to, him, and, his, troops, for, both, entertainment, and, inspiration, before, battle, el, cid, s, army, had, a, novel, approach, to, planning, strategy, as, well, holding, what, might, be, called, brainstorming, sessions, before, each, battle, to, discuss, tactics, they, frequently, used, unexpected, strategies, engaging, in, what, modern, generals, would, call, psychological, warfare, waiting, for, the, enemy, to, be, paralyzed, with, terror, and, then, attacking, them, suddenly, distracting, the, enemy, with, a, small, group, of, soldiers, etc, el, cid, used, this, distraction, in, capturing, the, town, of, castej, n, as, depicted, in, cantar, de, mio, cid, the, song, of, my, cid, el, cid, accepted, or, included, suggestions, from, his, troops, in, the, song, the, man, who, served, him, as, his, closest, adviser, was, his, vassal, and, kinsman, lvar, f, ez, minaya, meaning, my, brother, a, compound, word, of, spanish, possessive, mi, my, and, anaia, the, basque, word, for, brother, although, the, historical, lvar, f, ez, remained, in, castile, with, alfonso, vi, babieca, or, bavieca, was, el, cid, s, warhorse, several, stories, exist, about, el, cid, and, babieca, one, well, known, legend, about, el, cid, describes, how, he, acquired, the, stallion, according, to, this, story, rodrigo, s, godfather, pedro, el, grande, was, a, monk, at, a, carthusian, monastery, pedro, s, coming, of, age, gift, to, el, cid, was, his, pick, of, a, horse, from, an, andalusian, herd, el, cid, picked, a, horse, that, his, godfather, thought, was, a, weak, poor, choice, causing, the, monk, to, exclaim, babieca, stupid, hence, it, became, the, name, of, el, cid, s, horse, another, legend, states, that, in, a, competition, of, battle, to, become, king, sancho, s, campeador, or, champion, a, knight, on, horseback, wished, to, challenge, el, cid, the, king, wished, a, fair, fight, and, gave, el, cid, his, finest, horse, babieca, or, bavieca, this, version, says, babieca, was, raised, in, the, royal, stables, of, seville, and, was, a, highly, trained, and, loyal, war, horse, not, a, foolish, stallion, the, name, in, this, instance, could, suggest, that, the, horse, came, from, the, babia, region, in, le, n, spain, in, the, poem, carmen, campidoctoris, babieca, appears, as, a, gift, from, a, barbarian, to, el, cid, so, its, name, could, also, be, derived, from, barbieca, or, horse, of, the, barbarian, regardless, babieca, became, a, great, warhorse, famous, to, the, christians, feared, by, el, cid, s, enemies, and, loved, by, el, cid, who, allegedly, requested, that, babieca, be, buried, with, him, in, the, monastery, of, san, pedro, de, carde, a, babieca, is, mentioned, in, several, tales, and, historical, documents, about, el, cid, including, the, lay, of, el, cid, a, weapon, traditionally, identified, as, el, cid, s, sword, tizona, used, to, be, displayed, in, the, army, museum, museo, del, ej, rcito, in, toledo, in, 1999, a, small, sample, of, the, blade, underwent, metallurgical, analysis, which, confirmed, that, the, blade, was, made, in, moorish, c, rdoba, in, the, eleventh, century, and, contained, amounts, of, damascus, steel, in, 2007, the, autonomous, community, of, castile, and, le, n, bought, the, sword, for, 1, 6, million, and, it, is, currently, on, display, at, the, museum, of, burgos, el, cid, also, had, a, sword, called, colada, el, cid, married, jimena, d, az, who, was, said, to, be, part, of, an, aristocratic, family, from, asturias, in, the, mid, 1070s, the, historia, roderici, calls, her, a, daughter, of, a, count, diego, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, tradition, states, that, when, el, cid, first, laid, eyes, on, her, he, was, enamoured, of, her, great, beauty, el, cid, and, jimena, had, two, daughters, cristina, and, mar, a, and, a, son, the, latter, diego, rodr, guez, was,
