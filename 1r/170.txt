and, language, gaud, s, professional, life, continually, investigated, mechanical, building, structures, early, on, gaud, was, inspired, by, oriental, arts, india, persia, japan, through, the, study, of, the, historicist, architectural, theoreticians, such, as, walter, pater, john, ruskin, and, william, morris, the, influence, of, the, oriental, movement, can, be, seen, in, works, like, the, capricho, the, g, ell, palace, the, g, ell, pavilions, and, the, casa, vicens, as, a, student, gaud, studied, a, collection, of, photographs, of, egyptian, indian, persian, mayan, chinese, and, japanese, art, owned, by, the, school, of, architecture, the, collection, also, included, moorish, monuments, in, spain, which, inspired, many, of, his, early, works, he, studied, the, book, plans, elevations, sections, and, details, of, the, alhambra, by, owen, jones, 114, he, took, various, structural, and, ornamental, solutions, from, nasrid, and, mud, jar, art, which, he, used, with, variations, and, stylistic, freedom, notably, gaud, observed, of, islamic, art, its, spatial, uncertainty, its, concept, of, structures, with, limitless, space, its, feeling, of, sequence, fragmented, with, holes, and, partitions, which, create, a, divide, without, disrupting, the, feeling, of, open, space, by, enclosing, it, with, barriers, 8, the, gothic, revival, most, influenced, him, promoted, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, by, the, theoretical, works, of, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, the, french, architect, called, for, studying, the, styles, of, the, past, and, adapting, them, in, a, rational, manner, taking, into, account, both, structure, and, design, 44, chapter, els, anys, d, aprenentatge, de, gaud, this, influence, is, reflected, in, the, teresian, college, the, episcopal, palace, in, astorga, the, casa, botines, and, the, bellesguard, house, as, well, as, in, the, crypt, and, the, apse, of, the, sagrada, fam, lia, nonetheless, for, gaud, the, gothic, style, was, imperfect, because, despite, the, effectiveness, of, some, of, its, structural, solutions, it, was, an, art, that, had, yet, to, be, perfected, in, his, own, words, gothic, art, is, imperfect, only, half, resolved, it, is, a, style, created, by, the, compasses, a, formulaic, industrial, repetition, its, stability, depends, on, constant, propping, up, by, the, buttresses, it, is, a, defective, body, held, up, on, crutches, the, proof, that, gothic, works, are, of, deficient, plasticity, is, that, they, produce, their, greatest, emotional, effect, when, they, are, mutilated, covered, in, ivy, and, lit, by, the, moon, 89, after, these, initial, influences, gaud, moved, towards, modernisme, then, in, its, heyday, modernisme, in, its, earlier, stages, was, inspired, by, historic, architecture, its, practitioners, saw, its, return, to, the, past, as, a, response, to, the, industrial, forms, imposed, by, the, industrial, revolution, s, technological, advances, the, use, of, these, older, styles, represented, a, moral, regeneration, that, allowed, the, bourgeoisie, to, identify, with, values, they, regarded, as, their, cultural, roots, the, renaixen, a, rebirth, the, revival, of, catalan, culture, that, began, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, brought, more, gothic, forms, into, the, catalan, national, style, that, aimed, to, combine, nationalism, and, cosmopolitanism, while, at, the, same, time, integrating, into, the, european, modernizing, movement, essential, features, of, modernisme, included, an, anticlassical, language, inherited, from, romanticism, with, a, tendency, to, lyricism, and, subjectivity, the, determined, connection, of, architecture, with, the, applied, arts, and, artistic, work, yielding, an, overtly, ornamental, style, the, use, of, new, materials, rich, in, contrasts, that, sought, a, plastic, effect, for, the, whole, a, strong, sense, of, optimism, and, faith, in, progress, that, reflected, the, atmosphere, of, prosperity, of, the, time, a, bourgeois, esthetic, 38, 39, gaud, is, usually, considered, the, great, master, of, catalan, modernism, but, his, works, find, their, main, inspiration, in, geometry, and, from, nature, gaud, studied, natural, and, anarchic, geometric, forms, searching, for, a, way, to, give, expression, to, these, forms, in, architecture, some, of, his, inspirations, came, from, visits, to, the, mountain, of, montserrat, the, caves, of, mallorca, the, saltpetre, caves, in, collbat, the, fraguerau, gorge, in, the, prades, mountains, behind, reus, the, pareis, mountain, in, the, north, of, mallorca, and, sant, miquel, del, fai, in, bigues, i, riells, 198, this, study, of, nature, translated, into, his, use, of, ruled, geometrical, forms, such, as, the, hyperbolic, paraboloid, the, hyperboloid, the, helicoid, and, the, cone, which, reflect, forms, gaud, found, in, nature, 266, ruled, surfaces, are, forms, generated, by, a, straight, line, known, as, the, generatrix, as, it, moves, over, one, or, several, lines, known, as, directrices, gaud, found, abundant, examples, of, them, in, nature, for, instance, in, rushes, reeds, and, bones, he, said, that, no, better, structure, exists, than, the, trunk, of, a, tree, or, a, human, skeleton, these, forms, are, both, functional, and, aesthetic, and, gaud, adapted, nature, to, the, structural, needs, of, architecture, he, used, to, equate, the, helicoid, form, to, movement, and, the, hyperboloid, to, light, concerning, ruled, surfaces, he, said, paraboloids, hyperboloids, and, helicoids, constantly, varying, the, incidence, of, the, light, are, rich, in, matrices, themselves, which, make, ornamentation, and, even, modelling, unnecessary, 238, another, element, widely, used, by, gaud, was, the, catenary, arch, he, had, studied, geometry, when, he, was, young, absorbing, numerous, articles, about, engineering, a, field, that, praised, the, catenary, curve, as, a, mechanical, element, although, at, that, time, they, were, used, only, in, the, construction, of, suspension, bridges, gaud, was, the, first, to, use, this, element, in, common, architecture, catenary, arches, in, works, like, the, casa, mil, the, teresian, college, the, crypt, of, the, col, nia, g, ell, and, the, sagrada, fam, lia, allowed, gaud, to, add, strength, to, his, structures, given, that, the, catenary, distributes, weight, evenly, affected, only, by, self, canceling, tangential, forces, 168, chapter, apunts, sobre, la, intu, ci, cient, fica, de, gaud, gaud, evolved, from, planar, to, spatial, geometry, and, then, to, ruled, geometry, these, forms, allowed, the, use, of, cheap, materials, such, as, brick, gaud, frequently, used, brick, laid, with, mortar, in, successive, layers, as, in, the, traditional, catalan, vault, laying, the, brick, flat, instead, of, on, its, side, or, its, end, 12, this, quest, for, new, structural, solutions, culminated, between, 1910, and, 1920, when, he, exploited, his, research, and, experience, in, his, masterpiece, the, sagrada, fam, lia, gaud, conceived, the, interior, of, the, church, as, if, it, were, a, forest, with, a, set, of, tree, like, columns, growing, into, branches, to, support, a, structure, of, intertwined, hyperboloid, vaults, he, inclined, the, columns, so, they, could, better, resist, the, perpendicular, pressure, on, their, section, he, also, gave, them, a, double, turn, helicoidal, shape, right, turn, and, left, turn, as, in, the, branches, and, trunks, of, trees, this, structure, is, now, known, to, be, fractal, 144, chapter, gaud, geometria, estructura, i, construcci, together, with, a, modulation, of, the, space, that, divides, it, into, small, independent, and, self, supporting, segment, it, creates, a, structure, that, supports, the, mechanical, traction, forces, without, need, for, buttresses, as, required, by, the, neo, gothic, style, 91, 92, gaud, thus, achieved, a, structured, and, logical, solution, establishing, an, architectural, style, that, was, original, simple, practical, and, aesthetic, this, new, constructional, technique, allowed, gaud, to, achieve, his, greatest, architectural, goal, to, perfect, and, surpass, gothic, style, the, hyperboloid, vaults, have, their, center, where, gothic, vaults, placed, their, keystone, and, the, hyperboloid, allows, for, a, hole, in, this, space, to, let, natural, light, in, in, the, intersection, between, vaults, where, gothic, vaults, have, ribs, the, hyperboloid, allows, holes, as, well, which, gaud, employed, to, give, the, impression, of, a, starry, sky, gaud, complemented, these, insights, with, a, unique, spatial, vision, that, allowed, him, to, conceive, his, designs, in, three, dimensions, he, said, that, he, had, acquired, this, spatial, sense, as, a, boy, by, looking, at, his, father, s, drawings, of, boilers, and, stills, 16, because, of, this, spatial, conception, gaud, preferred, to, work, with, casts, and, scale, models, or, even, improvise, on, site, as, a, work, progressed, reluctant, to, draw, plans, he, sketched, his, works, only, when, required, another, of, gaud, s, innovations, in, the, technical, realm, was, the, use, of, a, scale, model, to, calculate, structures, for, the, church, of, the, col, nia, g, ell, he, built, a, 1, 10, scale, model, with, a, height, of, 4, metres, 13, ft, in, a, shed, next, to, the, building, there, he, set, up, a, model, that, had, strings, with, small, bags, full, of, birdshot, hanging, from, them, on, a, drawing, board, that, was, attached, to, the, ceiling, he, drew, the, floor, of, the, church, and, he, hung, the, strings, for, the, catenaries, with, the, birdshot, for, the, weight, from, the, supporting, points, of, the, building, columns, and, corners, these, weights, produced, a, catenary, curve, in, both, the, arches, and, vaults, at, that, point, he, took, a, photograph, that, when, inverted, showed, the, structure, for, columns, and, arches, gaud, then, painted, over, these, photographs, with, gouache, or, pastel, the, outline, of, the, church, defined, he, recorded, every, detail, of, the, building, architectural, stylistic, and, decorative, 366, 367, gaud, s, position, in, the, history, of, architecture, is, that, of, a, creative, genius, who, inspired, by, nature, developed, a, unique, style, that, attained, technical, perfection, as, well, as, aesthetic, value, gaud, s, structural, innovations, were, to, an, extent, the, result, of, his, journey, through, various, styles, these, styles, culminated, in, his, work, which, reinterpreted, and, perfected, them, gaud, passed, through, the, historicism, and, eclecticism, of, his, generation, without, connecting, with, other, 20th, century, architectural, movements, the, bauhaus, school, represented, an, antithetical, evolution, to, that, initiated, by, gaud, given, that, it, later, reflected, the, disdain, and, the, initial, lack, of, comprehension, of, the, work, of, the, modernista, architect, among, other, factors, that, led, to, the, initial, neglect, of, gaudi, s, work, was, that, despite, his, numerous, assistants, and, helpers, gaud, created, no, school, never, taught, nor, did, he, leave, written, documents, some, of, his, subordinates, adopted, his, innovations, above, all, francesc, berenguer, and, josep, maria, jujol, others, like, c, sar, martinell, francesc, folguera, and, josep, francesc, r, fols, graduated, towards, noucentisme, leaving, the, master, s, trail, despite, this, influence, can, be, discerned, in, some, architects, that, either, formed, part, of, the, modernista, movement, or, departed, from, it, and, who, had, had, no, direct, contact, with, him, such, as, josep, maria, pericas, casa, al, s, ripoll, bernard, martorell, olius, cemetery, and, llu, s, muncunill, masia, freixa, terrassa, nonetheless, gaud, left, a, deep, mark, on, 20th, century, architecture, masters, like, le, corbusier, declared, themselves, admirers, and, he, inspired, other, architects, such, as, pier, luigi, nervi, friedensreich, hundertwasser, oscar, niemeyer, f, lix, candela, eduardo, torroja, and, santiago, calatrava, frei, otto, used, gaud, s, forms, in, the, construction, of, the, munich, olympic, stadium, in, japan, the, work, of, kenji, imai, bears, evidence, of, gaud, s, influence, as, can, be, seen, in, the, memorial, for, the, twenty, six, martyrs, of, japan, in, nagasaki, japanese, national, architecture, award, in, 1962, where, the, use, of, gaud, s, famous, trencad, s, stands, out, 74, during, his, student, days, gaud, attended, craft, workshops, such, as, those, taught, by, eudald, punt, lloren, matamala, and, joan, o, s, where, he, learned, the, basic, aspects, of, techniques, relating, to, architecture, including, sculpture, carpentry, wrought, ironwork, stained, glass, ceramics, plaster, modelling, etc, 12, he, absorbed, technological, developments, integrating, into, his, technique, the, use, of, iron, and, reinforced, concrete, gaud, took, a, broad, view, of, architecture, as, a, multifunctional, design, in, which, every, single, detail, in, an, arrangement, must, be, harmoniously, made, and, well, proportioned, this, knowledge, allowed, him, to, design, architectural, projects, including, all, the, elements, of, his, works, from, furnishings, to, illumination, to, wrought, ironwork, gaud, was, also, a, craft, innovator, conceiving, technical, and, decorative, solutions, with, materials, not, always, associated, with, architecture, for, example, designing, ceramic, mosaics, made, of, waste, pieces, trencad, s, in, original, and, imaginative, combinations, for, the, restoration, of, mallorca, cathedral, he, invented, a, new, technique, to, produce, stained, glass, which, consisted, of, juxtaposing, three, glass, panes, of, primary, colours, and, sometimes, a, neutral, one, varying, the, thickness, of, the, glass, in, order, to, graduate, the, light, s, intensity, 40, he, personally, designed, many, of, the, sagrada, fam, lia, s, sculptures, he, studied, the, anatomy, of, the, figure, concentrating, on, gestures, for, this, purpose, he, studied, the, human, skeleton, and, sometimes, used, dummies, made, of, wire, to, test, the, appropriate, posture, of, the, figure, he, was, about, to, sculpt, in, a, second, step, he, photographed, his, models, using, a, mirror, system, that, provided, multiple, perspectives, he, then, made, plaster, casts, of, the, figures, both, of, people, and, animals, on, one, occasion, he, made, a, donkey, stand, up, so, it, would, not, move, he, modified, the, proportions, of, these, casts, to, obtain, the, figure, s, desired, appearance, depending, on, its, place, in, the, church, the, higher, up, the, bigger, it, would, be, eventually, he, sculpted, the, figures, in, stone, 76, 77, gaud, also, practiced, landscaping, often, in, urban, settings, he, aimed, to, place, his, works, in, appropriate, natural, and, architectural, surroundings, by, studying, the, scene, of, his, constructions, thoroughly, and, trying, to, naturally, integrate, them, into, those, surroundings, for, this, purpose, he, often, used, material, that, was, common, in, the, nearby, environment, such, as, bellesguard, slate, and, grey, bierzo, granite, in, the, episcopal, palace, astorga, many, of, his, projects, were, gardens, such, as, the, g, ell, park, and, the, can, artigas, gardens, or, incorporated, gardens, as, in, the, casa, vicens, or, the, g, ell, pavilions, gaud, s, harmonious, approach, to, landscaping, is, exemplified, at, the, first, mystery, of, the, glory, of, the, rosary, at, montserrat, where, the, architectural, framework, is, nature, itself, here, the, montserrat, rock, nature, encircles, the, group, of, sculptures, that, adorned, the, path, to, the, holy, cave, equally, gaud, stood, out, as, interior, decorator, decorating, most, of, his, buildings, personally, from, the, furnishings, to, the, smallest, details, in, each, case, he, knew, how, to, apply, stylistic, particularities, personalising, the, decoration, according, to, the, owner, s, taste, the, predominant, style, of, the, arrangement, or, its, place, in, the, surroundings, whether, urban, or, natural, secular, or, religious, many, of, his, works, were, related, to, liturgical, furnishing, from, the, design, of, a, desk, for, his, office, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, to, the, furnishings, designed, for, the, sobrellano, palace, of, comillas, he, designed, all, furnishing, of, the, vicens, calvet, batll, and, mil, houses, of, the, g, ell, palace, and, the, bellesguard, tower, and, the, liturgical, furnishing, of, the, sagrada, fam, lia, it, is, noteworthy, that, gaud, studied, some, ergonomy, in, order, to, adapt, his, furnishings, to, human, anatomy, many, of, his, furnishings, are, exhibited, at, gaud, house, museum, 1, another, aspect, is, the, intelligent, distribution, of, space, always, with, the, aim, of, creating, a, comfortable, intimate, interior, atmosphere, for, this, purpose, gaud, would, divide, spaces, into, sections, adapted, to, their, specific, use, by, means, of, low, walls, dropped, ceilings, sliding, doors, and, wall, closets, apart, from, taking, care, of, every, detail, of, all, structural, and, ornamental, elements, he, made, sure, his, constructions, had, good, lighting, and, ventilation, for, this, purpose, he, studied, each, project, s, orientation, with, respect, to, the, cardinal, points, as, well, as, the, local, climate, and, its, place, in, its, surroundings, at, that, time, there, was, an, increasing, demand, for, more, domestic, comfort, with, piped, water, and, gas, and, the, use, of, electric, light, all, of, which, gaud, expertly, incorporated, for, the, sagrada, fam, lia, for, example, he, carried, out, thorough, studies, on, acoustics, and, illumination, in, order, to, optimise, them, with, regard, to, light, he, stated, light, achieves, maximum, harmony, at, an, inclination, of, 45, since, it, resides, on, objects, in, a, way, that, is, neither, horizontal, nor, vertical, this, can, be, considered, medium, light, and, it, offers, the, most, perfect, vision, of, objects, and, their, most, exquisite, nuances, it, is, the, mediterranean, light, 96, lighting, also, served, gaud, for, the, organisation, of, space, which, required, a, careful, study, of, the, gradient, of, light, intensity, to, adequately, adapt, to, each, specific, environment, he, achieved, this, with, different, elements, such, as, skylights, windows, shutters, and, blinds, a, notable, case, is, the, gradation, of, colour, used, in, the, atrium, of, the, casa, batll, to, achieve, uniform, distribution, of, light, throughout, the, interior, he, also, tended, to, build, south, facing, houses, to, maximise, sunlight, 250, chapter, art, oficis, i, disseny, en, gaud, gaudi, s, stylistic, evolution, did, not, occur, in, clearly, defined, stages, with, obvious, boundaries, rather, each, stage, included, reflections, of, the, earlier, ones, disciple, and, biographer, joan, berg, s, defined, five, periods, in, gaud, s, productions, preliminary, period, mud, jar, morisco, moorish, mud, jar, art, emulated, gothic, naturalist, and, expressionist, and, organic, synthesis, 51, 68, gaud, s, first, works, both, from, his, student, days, and, just, after, stand, out, for, the, precision, of, their, details, the, use, of, geometry, and, the, prevalence, of, mechanical, considerations, in, the, calculations, 51, during, his, studies, his, notable, designs, include, a, cemetery, gate, 1875, a, spanish, pavilion, for, the, philadelphia, world, fair, of, 1876, a, quay, side, building, 1876, a, courtyard, for, the, diputaci, de, barcelona, 1876, a, monumental, fountain, for, the, pla, a, catalunya, in, barcelona, 1877, and, a, university, assembly, hall, 1877, 24, 29, gaud, had, a, long, standing, relationship, with, josep, fontser, despite, not, having, an, architecture, degree, fontser, received, the, commission, from, the, city, council, for, the, parc, de, la, ciutadella, development, carried, out, between, 1873, and, 1882, for, this, project, gaud, was, in, charge, of, the, design, of, the, park, s, entrance, gate, the, bandstand, s, balustrade, and, the, water, project, for, the, monumental, fountain, where, he, designed, an, artificial, cave, that, showed, his, liking, for, nature, and, the, organic, touch, that, later, became, central, 111, gaud, worked, for, francisco, de, paula, del, villar, on, the, apse, of, the, montserrat, monastery, designing, the, niche, for, the, image, of, the, black, virgin, of, montserrat, in, 1876, he, later, substituted, villar, in, the, works, of, the, sagrada, fam, lia, with, leandre, serrallach, he, worked, on, a, tram, line, project, to, villa, arcadia, in, montju, c, eventually, he, collaborated, with, joan, martorell, on, the, jesuit, church, on, carrer, casp, and, the, salesian, convent, in, passeig, de, sant, joan, as, well, as, the, villaricos, church, almer, a, he, also, carried, out, a, project, for, martorell, for, the, competition, for, a, new, fa, ade, for, barcelona, cathedral, which, was, not, accepted, his, relationship, with, martorell, whom, he, always, considered, one, of, his, main, and, most, influential, masters, brought, him, unexpected, luck, he, later, recommended, gaud, for, the, sagrada, fam, lia, after, his, graduation, as, an, architect, in, 1878, gaud, s, first, work, was, a, set, of, lampposts, for, the, pla, a, reial, the, project, for, the, girossi, newsstands, and, the, matar, cooperative, his, first, important, work, he, received, the, request, from, the, city, council, of, barcelona, in, february, 1878, when, he, had, graduated, but, not, yet, received, his, degree, 129, for, this, commission, he, designed, two, types, of, lampposts, one, with, six, arms, of, which, two, were, installed, in, the, pla, a, reial, and, another, with, three, of, which, two, were, installed, in, the, pla, del, palau, opposite, the, civil, government, the, lampposts, were, inaugurated, during, the, merc, festivities, in, 1879, made, of, cast, iron, with, a, marble, base, they, have, a, decoration, in, which, the, caduceus, of, mercury, is, prominent, symbol, of, commerce, and, emblem, of, barcelona, the, girossi, newsstands, project, which, was, not, carried, out, was, a, commission, from, tradesman, enrique, girossi, de, sanctis, it, would, have, consisted, of, 20, newsstands, spread, throughout, barcelona, each, would, have, included, a, public, lavatory, a, flower, stand, and, glass, panels, for, advertisements, as, well, as, a, clock, a, calendar, a, barometer, and, a, thermometer, gaud, conceived, a, structure, with, iron, pillars, and, marble, and, glass, slabs, crowned, by, a, large, iron, and, glass, roof, with, a, gas, illumination, system, 119, the, cooperativa, obrera, mataronense, matar, workers, cooperative, was, gaud, s, first, big, project, on, which, he, worked, from, 1878, to, 1882, for, salvador, pag, s, i, anglada, the, project, for, the, cooperative, s, head, office, in, matar, comprised, a, factory, a, worker, s, housing, estate, a, social, centre, and, a, services, building, though, only, the, factory, and, the, services, building, were, completed, in, the, factory, roof, gaud, used, the, catenary, arch, for, the, first, time, with, a, bolt, assembly, system, devised, by, philibert, de, l, orme, 26, he, used, ceramic, tile, decoration, for, the, first, time, in, the, services, building, gaud, laid, out, the, site, taking, account, of, solar, orientation, another, signature, element, and, included, landscaped, areas, he, even, designed, the, cooperative, s, banner, with, the, figure, of, a, bee, symbol, of, industriousness, in, may, 1878, gaud, designed, a, display, cabinet, for, the, esteban, comella, glove, factory, which, was, exhibited, in, the, spanish, pavilion, at, the, paris, world, exhibition, that, year, 139, this, work, attracted, the, attention, of, entrepreneur, eusebi, g, ell, visiting, the, french, capital, he, was, so, impressed, that, he, wanted, to, meet, gaud, on, his, return, beginning, a, long, friendship, and, professional, collaboration, g, ell, became, gaud, s, main, patron, and, sponsor, of, many, of, his, large, projects, g, ell, s, first, task, for, gaud, that, same, year, was, the, design, of, the, furniture, for, the, pantheon, chapel, of, the, palacio, de, sobrellano, in, comillas, which, was, then, being, constructed, by, joan, martorell, gaud, s, teacher, at, the, request, of, the, marquis, of, comillas, g, ell, s, father, in, law, gaud, designed, a, chair, a, bench, and, a, prayer, stool, the, chair, was, upholstered, with, velvet, finished, with, two, eagles, and, the, marquis, s, coat, of, arms, the, bench, stands, out, with, the, motif, of, a, dragon, designed, by, lloren, matamala, the, prayer, stool, is, decorated, with, plants, also, in, 1878, he, drew, up, the, plans, for, a, theatre, in, the, former, town, of, sant, gervasi, de,
