in, 1969, she, fell, out, with, senior, congress, party, leaders, over, several, issues, chief, among, them, was, her, decision, to, support, v, v, giri, the, independent, candidate, rather, than,

local, governments, as, well, as, the, urban, commercial, class, for, their, part, the, previously, voiceless, poor, would, at, last, gain, both, political, worth, and, political, weight, the,

in, 1974, india, ceded, the, tiny, islet, of, katchatheevu, to, sri, lanka, to, save, bandaranaike, s, socialist, government, from, a, political, disaster, however, relations, soured, over, sri, lanka, s, movement, away, from, socialism, under, j, r, jayewardene, whom, gandhi, despised, as, a, western, puppet, india, under, gandhi, was, alleged, to, have, supported, the, liberation, tigers, of, tamil, eelam, ltte, militants, in, the, 1980s, to, put, pressure, on, jayewardene, to, abide, by, indian, interests, nevertheless, gandhi, rejected, demands, to, invade, sri, lanka, in, the, aftermath, of, black, july, 1983, an, anti, tamil, pogrom, carried, out, by, sinhalese, mobs, gandhi, made, a, statement, emphasising, that, she, stood, for, the, territorial, integrity, of, sri, lanka, although, she, also, stated, that, india, cannot, remain, a, silent, spectator, to, any, injustice, done, to, the, tamil, community, india, s, relationship, with, pakistan, remained, strained, after, the, shimla, accord, in, 1972, gandhi, s, authorisation, of, the, detonation, of, a, nuclear, device, at, pokhran, in, 1974, was, viewed, by, pakistani, leader, zulfikar, ali, bhutto, as, an, attempt, to, intimidate, pakistan, into, accepting, india, s, hegemony, in, the, subcontinent, however, in, may, 1976, she, and, bhutto, both, agreed, to, reopen, diplomatic, establishments, and, normalise, relations, after, general, muhammad, zia, ul, haq, rose, to, power, in, pakistan, in, 1978, india, s, relations, with, its, neighbour, reached, a, nadir, gandhi, accused, general, zia, of,

siachen, conflict, against, pakistan, in, order, to, keep, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, out, of, south, asia, gandhi, was, instrumental, in, establishing, the, south, asian, association, for, regional, cooperation, saarc, in, 1983, gandhi, remained, a, staunch, supporter, of, the, palestinians, in, the, arab, israeli, conflict, and, was, critical, of, the, middle, east, diplomacy, sponsored, by, the, united, states, israel, was, viewed, as, a, religious, state, and, thus, an, analogue, to, india, s, archrival, pakistan, indian, diplomats, hoped, to, win, arab, support, in, countering, pakistan, in, kashmir, nevertheless, gandhi, authorised, the, development, of, a, secret, channel, of, contact, and, security, assistance, with, israel, in, the, late, 1960s, her, lieutenant, p, v, narasimha, rao, later, became, prime, minister, and, approved, full, diplomatic, ties, with, israel, in, 1992, india, s, pro, arab, policy, had, mixed, success, establishment, of, close, ties, with, the, socialist, and, secular, baathist, regimes, to, some, extent, neutralised, pakistani, propaganda, against, india, however, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, presented, a, dilemma, for, the, arab, and, muslim, states, of, the, middle, east, as, the, war, was, fought, by, two, states, both, friendly, to, the, arabs, the, progressive, arab, regimes, in, egypt, syria, and, algeria, chose, to, remain, neutral, while, the, conservative, pro, american, arab, monarchies, in, jordan, saudi, arabia, kuwait, and, united, arab, emirates, openly, supported, pakistan, egypt, s, stance, was, met, with, dismay, by, the, indians, who, had, come, to, expect, close, co, operation, with, the, baathist, regimes, but, the, death, of, nasser, in, 1970, and, sadat, s, growing, friendship, with, riyadh, and, his, mounting, differences, with, moscow, constrained, egypt, to, a, policy, of, neutrality, gandhi, s, overtures, to, muammar, gaddafi, were, rebuffed, libya, agreed, with, the, arab, monarchies, in, believing, that, gandhi, s, intervention, in, east, pakistan, was, an, attack, against, islam, the, 1971, war, became, a, temporary, stumbling, block, in, growing, indo, iranian, ties, although, iran, had, earlier, characterized, the, indo, pakistani, war, in, 1965, as, indian, aggression, the, shah, had, launched, an, effort, at, rapprochement, with, india, in, 1969, as, part, of, his, effort, to, secure, support, for, a, larger, iranian, role, in, the, persian, gulf, gandhi, s, tilt, towards, moscow, and, her, dismemberment, of, pakistan, was, perceived, by, the, shah, as, part, of, a, larger, anti, iran, conspiracy, involving, india, iraq, and, the, soviet, union, nevertheless, iran, had, resisted, pakistani, pressure, to, activate, the, baghdad, pact, and, draw, the, central, treaty, organisation, cento, into, the, conflict, gradually, indian, and, iranian, disillusionment, with, their, respective, regional, allies, led, to, a, renewed, partnership, between, the, nations, she, was, unhappy, with, the, lack, of, support, from, india, s, arab, allies, during, the, war, with, pakistan, while, the, shah, was, apprehensive, at, the, growing, friendship, between, pakistan, and, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, especially, saudi, arabia, and, the, growing, influence, of, islam, in, pakistani, society, there, was, an, increase, in, indian, economic, and, military, co, operation, with, iran, during, the, 1970s, the, 1974, india, iranian, agreement, led, to, iran, supplying, nearly, 75, percent, of, india, s, crude, oil, demands, gandhi, appreciated, the, shah, s, disregard, of, pan, islamism, in, diplomacy, one, of, the, major, developments, in, southeast, asia, during, gandhi, s, premiership, was, the, formation, of, the, association, of, southeast, asian, nations, asean, in, 1967, relations, between, asean, and, india, were, mutually, antagonistic, india, perceived, asean, to, be, linked, to, the, southeast, asia, treaty, organization, seato, and, therefore, it, was, seen, as, a, pro, american, organisation, on, their, part, the, asean, nations, were, unhappy, with, gandhi, s, sympathy, for, the, viet, cong, and, india, s, strong, links, with, the, ussr, furthermore, they, were, also, apprehensions, in, the, region, about, gandhi, s, plans, particularly, after, india, played, a, big, role, in, breaking, up, pakistan, and, facilitating, the, emergence, of, bangladesh, as, a, sovereign, country, in, 1971, india, s, entry, into, the, nuclear, weapons, club, in, 1974, also, contributed, to, tensions, in, southeast, asia, relations, only, began, to, improve, following, gandhi, s, endorsement, of, the, zopfan, declaration, and, the, disintegration, of, the, seato, alliance, in, the, aftermath, of, pakistani, and, american, defeats, in, the, region, nevertheless, gandhi, s, close, relations, with, reunified, vietnam, and, her, decision, to, recognize, the, vietnam, installed, government, of, cambodia, in, 1980, meant, that, india, and, asean, were, unable, to, develop, a, viable, partnership, on, 26, september, 1981, gandhi, was, conferred, with, the, honorary, degree, of, doctor, at, the, laucala, graduation, at, the, university, of, the, south, pacific, in, fiji, although, independent, india, was, initially, viewed, as, a, champion, of, various, african, independence, movements, its, cordial, relationship, with, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, its, liberal, views, of, british, policies, in, east, africa, had, harmed, its, image, as, a, staunch, supporter, of, various, independence, movements, in, the, third, world, indian, condemnation, of, militant, struggles, in, kenya, and, algeria, was, in, sharp, contrast, to, china, who, had, supported, armed, struggle, to, win, african, independence, after, reaching, a, high, diplomatic, point, in, the, aftermath, of, nehru, s, role, in, the, suez, crisis, india, s, isolation, from, africa, was, almost, complete, when, only, four, nations, ethiopia, kenya, nigeria, and, libya, supported, her, during, the, sino, indian, war, in, 1962, after, gandhi, became, prime, minister, diplomatic, and, economic, relations, with, the, states, which, had, sided, with, india, during, the, sino, indian, war, were, expanded, gandhi, began, negotiations, with, the, kenyan, government, to, establish, the, africa, india, development, cooperation, the, indian, government, also, started, considering, the, possibility, of, bringing, indians, settled, in, africa, within, the, framework, of, its, policy, goals, to, help, recover, its, declining, geo, strategic, influence, gandhi, declared, the, people, of, indian, origin, settled, in, africa, as, ambassadors, of, india, efforts, to, rope, in, the, asian, community, to, join, indian, diplomacy, however, came, to, naught, in, part, because, of, the, unwillingness, of, indians, to, remain, in, politically, insecure, surroundings, and, because, of, the, exodus, of, african, indians, to, britain, with, the, passing, of, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, in, 1968, in, uganda, the, african, indian, community, suffered, persecution, and, eventually, expulsion, under, the, government, of, idi, amin, foreign, and, domestic, policy, successes, in, the, 1970s, enabled, gandhi, to, rebuild, india, s, image, in, the, eyes, of, african, states, victory, over, pakistan, and, india, s, possession, of, nuclear, weapons, showed, the, degree, of, india, s, progress, furthermore, the, conclusion, of, the, indo, soviet, treaty, in, 1971, and, threatening, gestures, by, the, united, states, to, send, its, nuclear, armed, task, force, 74, into, the, bay, of, bengal, at, the, height, of, the, east, pakistan, crisis, had, enabled, india, to, regain, its, anti, imperialist, image, gandhi, firmly, tied, indian, anti, imperialist, interests, in, africa, to, those, of, the, soviet, union, unlike, nehru, she, openly, and, enthusiastically, supported, liberation, struggles, in, africa, at, the, same, time, chinese, influence, in, africa, had, declined, owing, to, its, incessant, quarrels, with, the, soviet, union, these, developments, permanently, halted, india, s, decline, in, africa, and, helped, to, reestablish, its, geo, strategic, presence, the, commonwealth, is, a, voluntary, association, of, mainly, former, british, colonies, india, maintained, cordial, relations, with, most, of, the, members, during, gandhi, s, time, in, power, in, the, 1980s, she, along, with, canadian, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, zambia, s, president, kenneth, kaunda, australian, prime, minister, malcolm, fraser, and, singapore, prime, minister, lee, kuan, yew, was, regarded, as, being, one, of, the, pillars, of, the, commonwealth, india, under, gandhi, also, hosted, the, 1983, commonwealth, heads, of, government, summit, in, new, delhi, gandhi, used, the, meetings, as, a, forum, to, put, pressure, on, member, countries, to, cut, economic, sports, and, cultural, ties, with, apartheid, south, africa, in, the, early, 1980s, under, gandhi, india, attempted, to, reassert, its, prominent, role, in, the, non, aligned, movement, by, focusing, on, the, relationship, between, disarmament, and, economic, development, by, appealing, to, the, economic, grievances, of, developing, countries, gandhi, and, her, successors, exercised, a, moderating, influence, on, the, non, aligned, movement, diverting, it, from, some, of, the, cold, war, issues, that, marred, the, controversial, 1979, havana, meeting, where, cuban, leader, fidel, castro, attempted, to, steer, the, movement, towards, the, soviet, union, although, hosting, the, 1983, summit, at, delhi, boosted, indian, prestige, within, the, movement, its, close, relations, with, the, soviet, union, and, its, pro, soviet, positions, on, afghanistan, and, cambodia, limited, its, influence, gandhi, spent, a, number, of, years, in, europe, during, her, youth, and, had, formed, many, friendships, there, during, her, premiership, she, formed, friendships, with, many, leaders, including, west, german, chancellor, willy, brandt, and, austrian, chancellor, bruno, kreisky, she, enjoyed, a, close, working, relationship, with, many, british, leaders, including, conservative, premiers, edward, heath, and, margaret, thatcher, the, relationship, between, india, and, the, soviet, union, deepened, during, gandhi, s, rule, the, main, reason, was, the, perceived, bias, of, the, united, states, and, china, rivals, of, the, ussr, towards, pakistan, the, support, of, the, soviets, with, arms, supplies, and, the, casting, of, a, veto, at, the, united, nations, helped, in, winning, and, consolidating, the, victory, over, pakistan, in, the, 1971, bangladesh, liberation, war, before, the, war, gandhi, signed, a, treaty, of, friendship, with, the, soviets, they, were, unhappy, with, the, 1974, nuclear, test, conducted, by, india, but, did, not, support, further, action, because, of, the, ensuing, cold, war, with, the, united, states, gandhi, was, unhappy, with, the, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, but, once, again, calculations, involving, relations, with, pakistan, and, china, kept, her, from, criticising, the, soviet, union, harshly, the, soviets, became, the, main, arms, supplier, during, the, gandhi, years, by, offering, cheap, credit, and, transactions, in, rupees, rather, than, in, dollars, the, easy, trade, deals, also, applied, to, non, military, goods, under, gandhi, by, the, early, 1980s, the, soviets, had, become, india, s, largest, trading, partner, soviet, intelligence, was, involved, in, india, during, indira, gandhi, s, administration, sometimes, at, gandhi, s, expense, in, the, prelude, to, operation, blue, star, by, 1981, the, soviets, had, launched, operation, kontakt, which, was, based, on, a, forged, document, purporting, to, contain, details, of, the, weapons, and, money, provided, by, the, isi, to, sikh, militants, who, wanted, to, create, an, independent, country, in, november, 1982, yuri, andropov, the, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, and, leader, of, the, soviet,

an, independent, sikh, state, indira, gandhi, s, decision, to, move, troops, into, the, punjab, was, based, on, her, taking, seriously, the, information, provided, by, the, soviets, regarding, secret, cia, support, for, the, sikhs, according, to, the, mitrokhin, archive, the, soviets, used, a, new, recruit, in, the, new, delhi, residency, named, agent, s, who, was, close, to, indira, gandhi, as, a, major, channel, for, providing, her, disinformation, agent, s, provided, indira, gandhi, with, false, documents, purporting, to, show, pakistani, involvement, in, the, khalistan, conspiracy, the, kgb, became, confident, that, it, could, continue, to, deceive, indira, gandhi, indefinitely, with, fabricated, reports, of, cia, and, pakistani, conspiracies, against, her, the, soviets, persuaded, rajiv, gandhi, during, a, visit, to, moscow, in, 1983, that, the, cia, was, engaged, in, subversion, in, the, punjab, when, rajiv, gandhi, returned, to, india, he, declared, this, to, be, true, the, kgb, was, responsible, for, indira, gandhi, exaggerating, the, threats, posed, by, both, the, cia, and, pakistan, this, kgb, role, in, facilitating, operation, bluestar, was, acknowledged, by, subramanian, swamy, who, stated, in, 1992, the, 1984, operation, bluestar, became, necessary, because, of, the, vast, disinformation, against, sant, bhindranwale, by, the, kgb, and, repeated, inside, parliament, by, the, congress, party, of, india, a, report, following, the, mitrokhin, archive, also, caused, some, historiographical, controversy, about, indira, gandhi, in, india, a, senior, leader, of, the, bharatiya, janata, party, l, k, advani, requested, of, the, government, a, white, paper, on, the, role, of, foreign, intelligence, agencies, and, a, judicial, enquiry, on, the, allegations, the, spokesperson, of, the, indian, congress, party, referred, to, the, book, as, pure, sensationalism, not, even, remotely, based, on, facts, or, records, and, pointed, out, that, the, book, is, not, based, on, official, records, from, the, soviet, union, l, k, advani, raised, his, voice, because, the, book, refers, to, ex, prime, minister, indira, gandhi, s, codenamed, vano, relations, with, the,

prime, minister, s, house, former, syndicate, member, s, k, patil, is, reported, to, have, said, that, mrs, gandhi, did, not, even, return, the, suitcases, an, extensive, footprint, in, the, indian, media, was, also, described, according, to, kgb, files, by, 1973, it, had, ten, indian, newspapers, on, its, payroll, which, cannot, be, identified, for, legal, reasons, as, well, as, a, press, agency, under, its, control, during, 1972, the, kgb, claimed, to, have, planted, 3, 789, articles, in, indian, newspapers, probably, more, than, in, any, other, country, in, the, non, communist, world, according, to, its, files, the, number, fell, to, 2, 760, in, 1973, but, rose, to, 4, 486, in, 1974, and, 5, 510, in, 1975, mitrokhin, estimated, that, in, some, major, nato, countries, despite, active, measures, campaigns, the, kgb, was, able, to, plant, a, little, more, than, 1, per, cent, of, the, articles, which, it, placed, in, the, indian, press, when, gandhi, came, to, power, in, 1966, lyndon, johnson, was, the, us, president, at, the, time, india, was, reliant, on, the, us, for, food, aid, gandhi, resented, the, us, policy, of, food, aid, being, used, as, a, tool, to, force, india, to, adopt, policies, favoured, by, the, us, she, also, resolutely, refused, to, sign, the, treaty, on, the, non, proliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, npt, relations, with, the, us, were, strained, badly, under, president, richard, nixon, and, his, favouring, of, pakistan, during, the, bangladesh, liberation, war, nixon, despised, gandhi, politically, and, personally, in, 1981, gandhi, met, president, ronald, reagan, for, the, first, time, at, the, north, south, summit, held, to, discuss, global, poverty, she, had, been, described, to, him, as, an, ogre, but, he, found, her, charming, and, easy, to, work, with, and, they, formed, a, close, working, relationship, during, her, premiership, in, the, 1980s, gandhi, presided, over, three, five, year, plans, as, prime, minister, two, of, which, succeeded, in, meeting, their, targeted, growth, there, is, considerable, debate, whether, gandhi, was, a, socialist, on, principle, or, out, of, political, expediency, sunanda, k, datta, ray, described, her, as, a, master, of, rhetoric, often, more, posture, than, policy, while, the, times, journalist, peter, hazelhurst, famously, quipped, that, gandhi, s, socialism, was, slightly, left, of, self, interest, critics, have, focused, on, the, contradictions, in, the, evolution, of, her, stance, towards, communism, gandhi, was, known, for, her, anti, communist, stance, in, the, 1950s, with, meghnad, desai, even, describing, her, as, the, scourge, of, communist, party, yet, she, later, forged, close, relations, with, indian, communists, even, while, using, the, army, to, break, the, naxalites, in, this, context, gandhi, was, accused, of, formulating, populist, policies, to, suit, her, political, needs, she, was, seemingly, against, the, rich, and, big, business, while, preserving, the, status, quo, to, manipulate, the, support, of, the, left, in, times, of, political, insecurity, such, as, the, late, 1960s, although, in, time, gandhi, came, to, be, viewed, as, the, scourge, of, the, right, wing, and, reactionary, political, elements, of, india, leftist, opposition, to, her, policies, emerged, as, early, as, 1969, critics, had, begun, accusing, her, of, insincerity, and, machiavellianism, the, indian, libertarian, wrote, it, would, be, difficult, to, find, a, more, machiavellian, leftist, than, mrs, indira, gandhi, for, here, is, machiavelli, at, its, best, in, the, person, of, a, suave, charming, and, astute, politician, j, barkley, rosser, jr, wrote, that, some, have, even, seen, the, declaration, of, emergency, rule, in, 1975, as, a, move, to, suppress, dissent, against, gandhi, s, policy, shift, to, the, right, in, the, 1980s, gandhi, was, accused, of, betraying, socialism, after, the, beginning, of, operation, forward, an, attempt, at, economic, reform, nevertheless, others, were, more, convinced, of, gandhi, s, sincerity, and, devotion, to, socialism, pankaj, vohra, noted, that, even, the, late, prime, minister, s, critics, would, concede, that, the, maximum, number, of, legislations, of, social, significance, was, brought, about, during, her, tenure, she, lives, in, the, hearts, of, millions, of, indians, who, shared, her, concern, for, the, poor, and, weaker, sections, and, who, supported, her, politics, in, summarising, the, biographical, works, on, gandhi, blema, s, steinberg, concludes, she, was, decidedly, non, ideological, only, 7, 4, 24, of, the, total, 330, biographical, extractions, posit, ideology, as, a, reason, for, her, policy, choices, steinberg, notes, gandhi, s, association, with, socialism, was, superficial, she, had, only, a, general, and, traditional, commitment, to, the, ideology, by, way, of, her, political, and, family, ties, gandhi, personally, had, a, fuzzy, concept, of, socialism, in, one, of, the, early, interviews, she, gave, as, prime, minister, gandhi, ruminated, i, suppose, you, could, call, me, a, socialist, but, you, have, understand, what, we, mean, by, that, term, we, used, the, word, because, it, came, closest, to, what, we, wanted, to, do, here, which, is, to, eradicate, poverty, you, can, call, it, socialism, but, if, by, using, that, word, we, arouse, controversy, i, don, t, see, why, we, should, use, it, i, don, t, believe, in, words, at, all, regardless, of, the, debate, over, her, ideology, or, lack, thereof, gandhi, remains, a, left, wing, icon, she, has, been, described, by, hindustan, times, columnist, pankaj, vohra, as, arguably, the, greatest, mass, leader, of, the, last, century, her, campaign, slogan, garibi, hatao, remove, poverty, has, become, an, often, used, motto, of, the, indian, national, congress, party, to, the, rural, and, urban, poor, untouchables, minorities, and, women, in, india, gandhi, was, indira, amma, or, mother, indira, gandhi, inherited, a, weak, and, troubled, economy, fiscal, problems, associated, with, the, war, with, pakistan, in, 1965, along, with, a, drought, induced, food, crisis, that, spawned, famines, had, plunged, india, into, the, sharpest, recession, since, independence, the, government, responded, by, taking, steps, to, liberalise, the, economy, and, agreeing, to, the, devaluation, of, the, currency, in, return, for, the, restoration, of, foreign, aid, the, economy, managed, to, recover, in, 1966, and, ended, up, growing, at, 4, 1, over, 1966, 1969, much, of, that, growth, however, was, offset, by, the, fact, that, the, external, aid, promised, by, the, united, states, government, and, the, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, ibrd, meant, to, ease, the, short, run, costs, of, adjustment, to, a, liberalised, economy, never, materialised, american, policy, makers, had, complained, of, continued, restrictions, imposed, on, the, economy, at, the, same, time, indo, us, relations, were, strained, because, of, gandhi, s, criticism, of, the, american, bombing, campaign, in, vietnam, while, it, was, thought, at, the, time, and, for, decades, after, that, president, johnson, s, policy, of, withholding, food, grain, shipments, was, to, coerce, indian, support, for, the, war, in, fact, it, was, to, offer, india, rainmaking, technology, that, he, wanted, to, use, as, a, counterweight, to, china, s, possession, of, the, atomic, bomb, in, light, of, the, circumstances, liberalisation, became, politically, suspect, and, was, soon, abandoned, grain, diplomacy, and, currency, devaluation, became, matters, of, intense, national, pride, in, india, after, the, bitter, experience, with, johnson, gandhi, decided, not, to, request, food, aid, in, the, future, moreover, her, government, resolved, never, again, to, become, so, vulnerably, dependent, on, aid, and, painstakingly, began, building, up, substantial, foreign, exchange, reserves, when, food, stocks, slumped, after, poor, harvests, in, 1972, the, government, made, it, a, point, to, use, foreign, exchange, to, buy, us, wheat, commercially, rather, than, seek, resumption, of, food, aid, the, period, of, 1967, 75, was, characterised, by, socialist, ascendency, in, india, which, culminated, in, 1976, with, the, official, declaration, of, state, socialism, gandhi, not, only, abandoned, the, short, lived, liberalisation, programme, but, also, aggressively, expanded, the, public, sector, with, new, licensing, requirements, and, other, restrictions, for, industry, she, began, a, new, course, by, launching, the, fourth, five, year, plan, in, 1969, the, government, targeted, growth, at, 5, 7, while, stating, as, its, goals, growth, with, stability, and, progressive, achievement, of, self, reliance, the, rationale, behind, the, overall, plan, was, gandhi, s, ten, point, programme, of, 1967, this, had, been, her, first, economic, policy, formulation, six, months, after, coming, to, office, the, programme, emphasised, greater, state, control, of, the, economy, with, the, understanding, that, government, control, assured, greater, welfare, than, private, control, related, to, this, point, were, a, set, of, policies, that, were, meant, to, regulate, the, private, sector, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, the, reversal, of, the, liberalisation, process, was, complete, and, india, s, policies, were, characterised, as, protectionist, as, ever, to, deal, with, india, s, food, problems, gandhi, expanded, the, emphasis, on, production, of, inputs, to, agriculture, that, had, already, been, initiated, by, her, father, jawaharlal, nehru, the, green, revolution, in, india, subsequently, culminated, under, her, government, in, the, 1970s, it, transformed, the, country, from, a, nation, heavily, reliant, on, imported, grains, and, prone, to, famine, to, one, largely, able, to, feed, itself, and, becoming, successful, in, achieving, its, goal, of, food, security, gandhi, had, a, personal, motive, in, pursuing, agricultural, self, sufficiency, having, found, india, s, dependency, on, the, u, s, for, shipments, of, grains, humiliating, the, economic, period, of, 1967, 1975, became, significant, for, its, major, wave, of, nationalisation, amidst, increased, regulation, of, the, private, sector, some, other, objectives, of, the, economic, plan, for, that, period, were, providing, for, the, minimum, needs, of, the, community, through, a, rural, works, program, and, the, removal, of, the, privy, purses, of, the, nobility, those, and, many, other, goals, of, the, 1967, programme, were, accomplished, by, 1974, 1975, nevertheless, the, success, of, the, overall, economic, plan, was, tempered, by, the, fact, that, annual, growth, at, 3, 3, 3, 4, over, 1969, 1974, fell, short, of, the, targeted, figure, the, fifth, five, year, plan, 1974, 1979, was, enacted, with, the, backdrop, of, the, state, of, emergency, and, the, twenty, point, program, of, 1975, it, was, the, economic, rationale, of, the, emergency, a, political, act, which, has, often, been, justified, on, economic, grounds, in, contrast, to, the, reception, of, gandhi, s, earlier, economic, plan, this, one, was, criticised, for, being, a, hastily, thrown, together, wish, list, she, promised, to, reduce, poverty, by, targeting, the, consumption, levels, of, the, poor, and, enact, wide, ranging, social, and, economic, reforms, in, addition, the, government, targeted, an, annual, growth, rate, of, 4, 4, over, the, period, of, the, plan, the, measures, of, the, emergency, regime, was, able, to, halt, the, economic, trouble, of, the, early, to, mid, 1970s, which, had, been, marred, by, harvest, failures, fiscal, contraction, and, the, breakdown, of, the, bretton, woods, system, of, fixed, exchanged, rates, the, resulting, turbulence, in, the, foreign, exchange, markets, was, accentuated, further, by, the, oil, shock, of, 1973, the, government, was, able, to, exceed, the, targeted, growth, figure, with, an, annual, growth, rate, of, 5, 0, 5, 2, over, the, five, year, period, of, the, plan, 1974, 79, the, economy, grew, at, the, rate, of, 9, in, 1975, 76, alone, and, the, fifth, plan, became, the, first, plan, during, which, the, per, capita, income, of, the, economy, grew, by, over, 5, gandhi, inherited, a, weak, economy, when, she, became, prime, minister, again, in, 1980, the, preceding, year, 1979, 80, under, the, janata, party, government, saw, the, strongest, recession, 5, 2, in, the, history, of, modern, india, with, inflation, rampant, at, 18, 2, gandhi, proceeded, to, abrogate, the, janata, party, government, s, five, year, plan, in, 1980, and, launched, the, sixth, five, year, plan, 1980, 85, her, government, targeted, an, average, growth, rate, of, 5, 2, over, the, period, of, the, plan, measures, to, check, inflation, were, also, taken, by, the, early, 1980s, it, was, under, control, at, an, annual, rate, of, about, 5, although, gandhi, continued, professing, socialist, beliefs, the, sixth, five, year, plan, was, markedly, different, from, the, years, of, garibi, hatao, populist, programmes, and, policies, were, replaced, by, pragmatism, there, was, an, emphasis, on, tightening, public, expenditures, greater, efficiency, of, the, state, owned, enterprises, soe, which, gandhi, qualified, as, a, sad, thing, and, on, stimulating, the, private, sector, through, deregulation, and, liberation, of, the, capital, market, the, government, subsequently, launched, operation, forward, in, 1982, the, first, cautious, attempt, at, reform, the, sixth, plan, went, on, to, become, the, most, successful, of, the, five, year, plans, yet, showing, an, average, growth, rate, of, 5, 7, over, 1980, 85, during, lal, bahadur, shastri, s, last, full, year, in, office, 1965, inflation, averaged, 7, 7, compared, to, 5, 2, at, the, end, of, gandhi, s, first, term, in, office, 1977, on, average, inflation, in, india, had, remained, below, 7, through, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, it, then, accelerated, sharply, in, the, 1970s, from, 5, 5, in, 1970, 71, to, over, 20, by, 1973, 74, due, to, the, international, oil, crisis, gandhi, declared, inflation, the, gravest, of, problems, in, 1974, at, 25, 2, and, devised, a, severe, anti, inflation, program, the, government, was, successful, in, bringing, down, inflation, during, the, emergency, achieving, negative, figures, of, 1, 1, by, the, end, of, 1975, 76, gandhi, inherited, a, tattered, economy, in, her, second, term, harvest, failures, and, a, second, oil, shock, in, the, late, 1970s, had, caused, inflation, to, rise, again, during, charan, singh, s, short, time, in, office, in, the, second, half, of, 1979, inflation, averaged, 18, 2, compared, to, 6, 5, during, gandhi, s, last, year, in, office, 1984, general, economic, recovery, under, gandhi, led, to, an, average, inflation, rate, of, 6, 5, from, 1981, 82, to, 1985, 86, the, lowest, since, the, beginning, of, india, s, inflation, problems, in, the, 1960s, the, unemployment, rate, remained, constant, at, 9, over, a, nine, year, period, 1971, 80, before, declining, to, 8, 3, in, 1983, despite, the, provisions, control, and, regulations, of, the, reserve, bank, of, india, most, banks, in, india, had, continued, to, be, owned, and, operated, by, private, persons, businessmen, who, owned, the, banks, were, often, accused, of, channeling, the, deposits, into, their, own, companies, and, ignoring, priority, sector, lending, furthermore, there, was, a, great, resentment, against, class, banking, in, india, which, had, left, the, poor, the, majority, of, the, population, unbanked, after, becoming, prime, minister, gandhi, expressed, her, intention, of, nationalising, the, banks, to, alleviate, poverty, in, a, paper, titled, stray, thoughts, on, bank, nationalisation, the, paper, received, overwhelming, public, support, in, 1969, gandhi, moved, to, nationalise, fourteen, major, commercial, banks, after, this, public, sector, bank, branch, deposits, increased, by, approximately, 800, percent, advances, took, a, huge, jump, by, 11, 000, percent, nationalisation, also, resulted, in, significant, growth, in, the, geographic, coverage, of, banks, the, number, of, bank, branches, rose, from, 8, 200, to, over, 62, 000, most, of, which, were, opened, in, unbanked, rural, areas, the, nationalisation, drive, not, only, helped, to, increase, household, savings, but, it, also, provided, considerable, investments, in, the, informal, sector, in, small, and, medium, sized, enterprises, and, in, agriculture, and, contributed, significantly, to, regional, development, and, to, the, expansion, of, india, s, industrial, and, agricultural, base, jayaprakash, narayan, who, became, famous, for, leading, the, opposition, to, gandhi, in, the, 1970s, solidly, praised, her, nationalisation, of, banks, having, been, re, elected, in, 1971, on, a, nationalisation, platform, gandhi, proceeded, to, nationalise, the, coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton, textiles, and, insurance, industries, most, of, this, was, done, to, protect, employment, and, the, interests, of, organised, labour, the, remaining, private, sector, industries, were, placed, under, strict, regulatory, control, during, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, foreign, owned, private, oil, companies, had, refused, to, supply, fuel, to, the, indian, navy, and, the, indian, air, force, in, response, gandhi, nationalised, some, oil, companies, in, 1973, however, major, nationalisations, occurred, in, 1974, and, 1976, forming, the, oil, majors, after, nationalisation, the, oil, majors, including, the, indian, oil, corporation, ioc, the, hindustan, petroleum, corporation, hpcl, and, the, bharat, petroleum, corporation, bpcl, had, to, keep, a, minimum, stock, level, of, oil, to, be, supplied, to, the, military, when, needed, in, 1966, gandhi, accepted, the, demands, of, the, akalis, to, reorganise, punjab, on, linguistic, lines, the, hindi, speaking, southern, half, of, punjab, became, a, separate, state, haryana, while, the, pahari, speaking, hilly, areas, in, the, northeast, were, joined, to, himachal, pradesh, by, this, action, she, had, hoped, to, ward, off, the, growing, political, conflict, between, hindu, and, sikh, groups, in, the, region, however, a, contentious, issue, that, was, considered, unresolved, by, the, akalis, was, the, status, of, chandigarh, a, prosperous, city, on, the, punjab, haryana, border, which, gandhi, declared, a, union, territory, to, be, shared, as, a, capital, by, both, the, states, victory, over, pakistan, in, 1971, consolidated, indian, power, in, kashmir, gandhi, indicated, that, she, would, make, no, major, concessions, on, kashmir, the, most, prominent, of, the, kashmiri, separatists, sheikh, abdullah, had, to, recognise, india, s, control, over, kashmir, in, light, of, the, new, order, in, south, asia, the, situation, was, normalised, in, the, years, following, the, war, after, abdullah, agreed, to, an, accord, with, gandhi, by, giving, up, the, demand, for, a, plebiscite, in, return, for, a, special, autonomous, status, for, kashmir, in, 1975, gandhi, declared, the, state, of, jammu, and, kashmir, as, a, constituent, unit, of, india, the, kashmir, conflict, remained, largely, peaceful, if, frozen, under, gandhi, s, premiership, in, 1972, gandhi, granted, statehood, to, meghalaya, manipur, and, tripura, while, the, north, east, frontier, agency, was, declared, a, union, territory, and, renamed, arunachal, pradesh, the, transition, to, statehood, for, the, territories, was, successfully, overseen, by, her, administration, and, it, was, followed, by, the, annexation, of, sikkim, in, 1975, the, principle, of, equal, pay, for, equal, work, for, both, men, and, women, was, enshrined, in, the, indian, constitution, under, the, gandhi, administration, gandhi, questioned, the, continued, existence, of, a, privy, purse, for, former, rulers, of, princely, states, she, argued, the, case, for, abolition, based, on, equal, rights, for, all, citizens, and, the, need, to, reduce, the, government, s, revenue, deficit, the, nobility, responded, by, rallying, around, the, jana, sangh, and, other, right, wing, parties, that, stood, in, opposition, to, gandhi, s, attempts, to, abolish, royal, privileges, the, motion, to, abolish, privy, purses, and, the, official, recognition, of, the, titles, was, originally, brought, before, the, parliament, in, 1970, it, was, passed, in, the, lok, sabha, but, fell, short, of, the, two, thirds, majority, in, the, rajya, sabha, by, a, single, vote, gandhi, responded, by, having, a, presidential, proclamation, issued, de, recognising, the, princes, with, this, withdrawal, of, recognition, their, claims, to, privy, purses, were, also, legally, lost, however, the, proclamation, was, struck, down, by, the, supreme, court, of, india, in, 1971, she, again, motioned, to, abolish, the, privy, purse, and, it, was, passed, successfully, as, the, 26th, amendment, to, the, constitution, of, india, gandhi, claimed, that, only, clear, vision, iron, will, and, the, strictest, discipline, can, remove, poverty, she, justified, the, imposition, of, the, state, of, emergency, in, 1975, in, the, name, of, the, socialist, mission, of, the, congress, armed, with, the, power, to, rule, by, decree, and, without, constitutional, constraints, she, embarked, on, a, massive, redistribution, program, the, provisions, included, rapid, enforcement, of, land, ceilings, housing, for, landless, labourers, the, abolition, of, bonded, labour, and, a, moratorium, on, the, debts, of, the, poor, north, india, was, at, the, centre, of, the, reforms, millions, of, hectares, of, land, were, acquired, and, redistributed, the, government, was, also, successful, in, procuring, houses, for, landless, labourers, according, to, francine, frankel, three, fourths, of, the, targeted, four, million, houses, was, achieved, in, 1975, alone, nevertheless, others, have, disputed, the, success, of, the, program, and, criticised, gandhi, for, not, doing, enough, to, reform, land, ownership, the, political, economist, jyotindra, das, gupta, cryptically, questioned, whether, or, not, the, real, supporters, of, land, holders, were, in, jail, or, in, power, critics, also, accused, gandhi, of, choosing, to, talk, left, and, act, right, referring, to, her, concurrent, pro, business, decisions, and, endeavours, j, barkley, rosser, jr, wrote, that, some, have, even, seen, the, declaration, of, emergency, rule, in, 1975, as, a, move, to, suppress, dissent, against, gandhi, s, policy, shift, to, the, right, regardless, of, the, controversy, over, the, nature, of, the, reforms, the, long, term, effects, of, the, social, changes, gave, rise, to, the, prominence, of, middle, ranking, farmers, from, intermediate, and, lower, castes, in, north, india, the, rise, of, the, newly, empowered, social, classes, challenged, the, political, establishment, of, the, hindi, belt, in, the, years, to, come, under, the, 1950, constitution, of, india, hindi, was, to, be, the, official, national, language, by, 1965, that, was, unacceptable, to, many, non, hindi, speaking, states, which, wanted, the, continued, use, of, english, in, government, in, 1967, gandhi, introduced, a, constitutional, amendment, that, guaranteed, the, de, facto, use, of, both, hindi, and, english, as, official, languages, it, established, the, official, government, policy, of, bilingualism, in, india, and, satisfied, the, non, hindi, speaking, indian, states, she, thus, put, herself, forward, as, a, leader, with, a, pan, indian, vision, nevertheless, critics, alleged, that, her, stance, was, actually, meant, to, weaken, the, position, of, rival, congress, leaders, from, the, northern, states, such, as, uttar, pradesh, where, there, had, been, strong, sometimes, violent, pro, hindi, agitations, gandhi, came, out, of, the, language, conflicts, with, the, strong, support, of, the, south, indian, populace, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, gandhi, had, the, indian, army, crush, militant, communist, uprisings, in, the, indian, state, of, west, bengal, the, communist, insurgency, in, india, was, completely, suppressed, during, the, state, of, emergency, gandhi, considered, the, north, eastern, region, important, because, of, its, strategic, situation, in, 1966, the, mizo, uprising, took, place, against, the, government, of, india, and, overran, almost, the, whole, of, the, mizoram, region, she, ordered, the, indian, army, to, launch, massive, retaliatory, strikes, in, response, the, rebellion, was, suppressed, with, the, indian, air, force, carrying, out, airstrikes, in, aizawl, it, remains, the, only, instance, of, india, carrying, out, airstrikes, in, its, own, territory, the, defeat, of, pakistan, in, 1971, and, the, secession, of, east, pakistan, as, pro, india, bangladesh, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, mizo, separatist, movement, in, 1972, after, the, less, extremist, mizo, leaders, came, to, the, negotiating, table, gandhi, upgraded, mizoram, to, the, status, of, a, union, territory, a, small, scale, insurgency, by, some, militants, continued, into, the, late, 1970s, but, it, was, successfully, dealt, with, by, the, government, the, mizo, conflict, was, definitively, resolved, during, the, administration, of, gandhi, s, son, rajiv, today, mizoram, is, considered, one, of, the, most, peaceful, states, in, the, north, east, responding, to, the, insurgency, in, nagaland, indira, gandhi, unleashed, a, powerful, military, offensive, in, the, 1970s, finally, a, massive, crackdown, on, the, insurgents, took, place, during, the, state, of, emergency, ordered, by, gandhi, the, insurgents, soon, agreed, to, surrender, and, signed, the, shillong, accord, in, 1975, while, the, agreement, was, considered, a, victory, for, the, indian, government, and, ended, large, scale, conflicts, there, have, since, been, spurts, of, violence, by, rebel, holdouts, and, ethnic, conflict, amongst, the, tribes, gandhi, contributed, to, and, carried, out, further, the, vision, of, jawaharlal, nehru, the, former, premier, of, india, to, develop, its, nuclear, program, gandhi, authorised, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, in, 1967, in, response, to, test, no, 6, by, the, people, s, republic, of, china, gandhi, saw, the, test, as, chinese, nuclear, intimidation, and, promoted, nehru, s, views, to, establish, india, s, stability, and, security, interests, independent, from, those, of, the, nuclear, superpowers, the, programme, became, fully, mature, in, 1974, when, raja, ramanna, reported, to, gandhi, that, india, had, the, ability, to, test, its, first, nuclear, weapon, gandhi, gave, verbal, authorisation, for, the, test, and, preparations, were, made, in, the, indian, army, s, pokhran, test, range, in, 1974, india, successfully, conducted, an, underground, nuclear, test, unofficially, code, named, smiling, buddha, near, the, desert, village, of, pokhran, in, rajasthan, as, the, world, was, quiet, about, this, test, a, vehement, protest, came, from, pakistan, as, its, prime, minister, zulfikar, ali, bhutto, described, the, test, as, indian, hegemony, to, intimidate, pakistan, in, response, to, this, bhutto, launched, a, massive, campaign, to, make, pakistan, a, nuclear, power, bhutto, asked, the, nation, to, unite, and, slogans, such, as, hum, ghaas, aur, pattay, kha, lay, gay, magar, nuclear, power, ban, k, rhe, gay, we, will, eat, grass, or, leaves, or, even, go, hungry, but, we, will, get, nuclear, power, were, employed, gandhi, directed, a, letter, to, bhutto, and, later, to, the, world, claiming, the, test, was, for, peaceful, purposes, and, part, of, india, s, commitment, to, develop, its, programme, for, industrial, and, scientific, use, in, spite, of, intense, international, criticism, and, steady, decline, in, foreign, investment, and, trade, the, nuclear, test, was, popular, domestically, the, test, caused, an, immediate, revival, of, gandhi, s, popularity, which, had, flagged, considerably, from, its, heights, after, the, 1971, war, the, overall, popularity, and, image, of, the, congress, party, was, enhanced, and, the, congress, party, was, well, received, in, the, indian, parliament, she, married, feroze, gandhi, at, the, age, of, 25, in, 1942, their, marriage, lasted, 18, years, until, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, 1960, they, had, two, sons, rajiv, and, sanjay, initially, her, younger, son, sanjay, had, been, her, chosen, heir, but, after, his, death, in, a, flying, accident, in, june, 1980, indira, gandhi, persuaded, her, reluctant, elder, son, rajiv, to, quit, his, job, as, a, pilot, and, enter, politics, in, february, 1981, rajiv, took, office, as, prime, minister, following, his, mother, s, assassination, in, 1984, he, served, until, december, 1989, rajiv, gandhi, was, assassinated, by, a, suicide, bomber, working, on, behalf, of, ltte, on, 21, may, 1991, in, 1952, in, a, letter, to, her, american, friend, dorothy, norman, gandhi, wrote, i, am, in, no, sense, a, feminist, but, i, believe, in, women, being, able, to, do, everything, given, the, opportunity, to, develop, capable, indian, women, have, come, to, the, top, at, once, while, this, statement, appears, paradoxical, it, reflects, gandhi, s, complex, feelings, toward, her, gender, and, feminism, her, egalitarian, upbringing, with, her, cousins, helped, contribute, to, her, sense, of, natural, equality, flying, kites, climbing, trees, playing, marbles, with, her, boy, cousins, indira, said, she, hardly, knew, the, difference, between, a, boy, and, a, girl, until, the, age, of, twelve, gandhi, did, not, often, discuss, her, gender, but, she, involved, herself, in, women, s, issues, before, becoming, the, prime, minister, before, her, election, as, prime, minister, she, became, active, in, the, organisational, wing, of, the, congress, party, working, in, part, in, the, women, s, department, in, 1956, she, had, an, active, role, in, setting, up, the, congress, party, s, women, s, section, unsurprisingly, a, lot, of, her, involvement, stemmed, from, her, father, as, an, only, child, gandhi, naturally, stepped, into, the, political, light, and, as, a, woman, she, naturally, helped, head, the, women, s, section, of, the, congress, party, she, often, tried, to, organise, women, to, involve, themselves, in, politics, although, rhetorically, gandhi, may, have, attempted, to, separate, her, political, success, from, her, gender, she, did, involve, herself, in, women, s, organizations, the, political, parties, in, india, paid, substantial, attention, to, gandhi, s, gender, before, she, became, prime, minister, hoping, to, use, her, for, political, gain, even, though, men, surrounded, her, during, her, upbringing, she, still, had, a, female, role, model, as, a, child, several, books, on, gandhi, reference, her, interest, in, joan, of, arc, in, gandhi, s, own, accounts, through, her, letters, she, wrote, to, her, friend, dorothy, norman, in, 1952, she, wrote, at, about,

members, of, her, family, were, the, only, people, capable, of, leading, them, gandhi, had, been, swept, up, in, the, call, for, indian, independence, since, she, was, born, in, 1917, thus, by, 1947, she, was, already, well, immersed, in, politics, and, by, 1966, when, she, first, assumed, the, position, of, prime, minister, she, had, held, several, cabinet, positions, in, her, father, s, office, her, advocacy, for, women, s, rights, began, with, her, help, in, establishing, the, congress, party, s, women, s, section, in, 1956, she, wrote, in, a, letter, it, is, because, of, this, that, i, am, taking, a, much, more, active, part, in, politics, i, have, to, do, a, great, deal, of, touring, in, order, to, set, up, the, congress, party, women, s, section, and, am, on, numerous, important,
