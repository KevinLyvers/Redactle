damascene, was, an, arab, christian, monk, priest, hymnographer, and, apologist, he, was, born, and, raised, in, damascus, c, 675, or, 676, the, precise, date, and, place, of, his, death, is, not, known, though, tradition, places, it, at, his, monastery, mar, saba, near, jerusalem, on, 4, december, 749, a, polymath, whose, fields, of, interest, and, contribution, included, law, theology, philosophy, and, music, he, was, given, the, by, name, of, chrysorroas, literally, streaming, with, gold, i, e, the, golden, speaker, he, wrote, works, expounding, the, christian, faith, and, composed, hymns, which, are, still, used, both, liturgically, in, eastern, christian, practice, throughout, the, world, as, well, as, in, western, lutheranism, at, easter, he, is, one, of, the, fathers, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, is, best, known, for, his, strong, defence, of, icons, the, catholic, church, regards, him, as, a, doctor, of, the, church, often, referred, to, as, the, doctor, of, the, assumption, due, to, his, writings, on, the, assumption, of, mary, he, was, also, a, prominent, exponent, of, perichoresis, and, employed, the, concept, as, a, technical, term, to, describe, both, the, interpenetration, of, the, divine, and, human, natures, of, christ, and, the, relationship, between, the, hypostases, of, the, trinity, john, is, at, the, end, of, the, patristic, period, of, dogmatic, development, and, his, contribution, is, less, one, of, theological, innovation, than, one, of, a, summary, of, the, developments, of, the, centuries, before, him, in, catholic, theology, he, is, therefore, known, as, the, last, of, the, greek, fathers, the, main, source, of, information, for, the, life, of, john, of, damascus, is, a, work, attributed, to, one, john, of, jerusalem, identified, therein, as, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, this, is, an, excerpted, translation, into, greek, of, an, earlier, arabic, text, the, arabic, original, contains, a, prologue, not, found, in, most, other, translations, and, was, written, by, an, arab, monk, michael, who, explained, that, he, decided, to, write, his, biography, in, 1084, because, none, was, available, in, his, day, however, the, main, arabic, text, seems, to, have, been, written, by, an, unknown, earlier, author, sometime, between, the, early, 9th, and, late, 10th, century, written, from, a, hagiographical, point, of, view, and, prone, to, exaggeration, and, some, legendary, details, it, is, not, the, best, historical, source, for, his, life, but, is, widely, reproduced, and, considered, to, contain, elements, of, some, value, the, hagiographic, novel, barlaam, and, josaphat, is, a, work, of, the, 10th, century, attributed, to, a, monk, named, john, it, was, only, considerably, later, that, the, tradition, arose, that, this, was, john, of, damascus, but, most, scholars, no, longer, accept, this, attribution, instead, much, evidence, points, to, euthymius, of, athos, a, georgian, who, died, in, 1028, john, was, born, in, damascus, in, 675, or, 676, to, a, prominent, damascene, christian, arab, family, his, father, sarjun, ibn, mansur, served, as, an, official, of, the, early, umayyad, caliphate, his, grandfather, mansur, ibn, sarjun, was, a, prominent, byzantine, official, of, damascus, who, had, been, responsible, for, the, taxes, of, the, region, during, the, reign, of, emperor, heraclius, and, also, served, under, emperor, maurice, mansur, seems, to, have, played, a, role, in, the, capitulation, of, damascus, to, the, troops, of, khalid, ibn, al, walid, in, 635, after, securing, favorable, conditions, of, surrender, eutychius, a, 10th, century, melkite, patriarch, mentions, him, as, one, high, ranking, official, involved, in, the, surrender, of, the, city, to, the, muslims, the, tribal, background, of, mansur, ibn, sarjun, john, s, grandfather, is, unknown, but, biographer, daniel, sahas, has, speculated, that, the, name, mansur, could, have, implied, descent, from, the, arab, christian, tribes, of, kalb, or, taghlib, the, name, was, common, among, syrian, christians, of, arab, origins, and, eutychius, noted, that, the, governor, of, damascus, who, was, likely, mansur, ibn, sarjun, was, an, arab, however, sahas, also, asserts, that, the, name, does, not, necessarily, imply, an, arab, background, and, could, have, been, used, by, non, arab, semitic, syrians, while, sahas, and, biographers, f, h, chase, and, andrew, louth, assert, that, mans, r, was, an, arabic, name, raymond, le, coz, asserts, that, the, family, was, without, doubt, of, syrian, origin, indeed, according, to, historian, daniel, j, janosik, both, aspects, could, be, true, for, if, his, family, ancestry, were, indeed, syrian, his, grandfather, could, have, been, given, an, arabic, name, when, the, arabs, took, over, the, government, when, syria, was, conquered, by, the, muslim, arabs, in, the, 630s, the, court, at, damascus, retained, its, large, complement, of, christian, civil, servants, john, s, grandfather, among, them, john, s, father, sarjun, sergius, went, on, to, serve, the, umayyad, caliphs, john, of, jerusalem, claims, that, he, also, served, as, a, senior, official, in, the, fiscal, administration, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, under, abd, al, malik, before, leaving, damascus, and, his, position, around, 705, to, go, to, jerusalem, and, become, a, monk, however, this, point, is, debated, within, the, academic, community, as, there, is, no, trace, of, him, in, the, umayyad, archives, unlike, his, father, and, grandfather, some, researchers, such, as, robert, g, hoyland, deny, such, an, affiliation, while, others, like, daniel, sahas, or, the, orthodox, historian, jean, meyendorff, suppose, that, he, might, have, been, a, lower, level, tax, administrator, a, local, tax, collector, who, would, not, have, needed, to, be, mentioned, in, the, archives, but, who, might, not, have, necessarily, been, part, of, the, court, either, in, addition, john, s, own, writings, never, refer, to, any, experience, in, a, muslim, court, it, is, believed, that, john, became, a, monk, at, mar, saba, and, that, he, was, ordained, as, a, priest, in, 735, john, was, raised, in, damascus, and, arab, christian, folklore, holds, that, during, his, adolescence, john, associated, with, the, future, umayyad, caliph, yazid, i, and, the, taghlibi, christian, court, poet, al, akhtal, one, of, the, vitae, describes, his, father, s, desire, for, him, to, learn, not, only, the, books, of, the, muslims, but, those, of, the, greeks, as, well, from, this, it, has, been, suggested, that, john, may, have, grown, up, bilingual, john, does, indeed, show, some, knowledge, of, the, quran, which, he, criticizes, harshly, other, sources, describe, his, education, in, damascus, as, having, been, conducted, in, accordance, with, the, principles, of, hellenic, education, termed, secular, by, one, source, and, classical, christian, by, another, one, account, identifies, his, tutor, as, a, monk, by, the, name, of, cosmas, who, had, been, kidnapped, by, arabs, from, his, home, in, sicily, and, for, whom, john, s, father, paid, a, great, price, as, a, refugee, from, italy, cosmas, brought, with, him, the, scholarly, traditions, of, latin, christianity, cosmas, was, said, to, have, rivaled, pythagoras, in, arithmetic, and, euclid, in, geometry, he, also, taught, john, s, orphan, friend, cosmas, of, maiuma, john, possibly, had, a, career, as, a, civil, servant, for, the, caliph, in, damascus, before, his, ordination, he, then, became, a, priest, and, monk, at, the, mar, saba, monastery, near, jerusalem, one, source, suggests, john, left, damascus, to, become, a, monk, around, 706, when, al, walid, i, increased, the, islamicisation, of, the, caliphate, s, administration, this, is, uncertain, as, muslim, sources, only, mention, that, his, father, sarjun, sergius, left, the, administration, around, this, time, and, fail, to, name, john, at, all, during, the, next, two, decades, culminating, in, the, siege, of, constantinople, 717, 718, the, umayyad, caliphate, progressively, occupied, the, borderlands, of, the, byzantine, empire, an, editor, of, john, s, works, father, le, quien, has, shown, that, john, was, already, a, monk, at, mar, saba, before, the, dispute, over, iconoclasm, explained, below, in, the, early, 8th, century, iconoclasm, a, movement, opposed, to, the, veneration, of, icons, gained, acceptance, in, the, byzantine, court, in, 726, despite, the, protests, of, germanus, patriarch, of, constantinople, emperor, leo, iii, who, had, forced, his, predecessor, theodosius, iii, to, abdicate, and, himself, assumed, the, throne, in, 717, immediately, before, the, great, siege, issued, his, first, edict, against, the, veneration, of, images, and, their, exhibition, in, public, places, all, agree, that, john, of, damascus, undertook, a, spirited, defence, of, holy, images, in, three, separate, publications, the, earliest, of, these, works, his, apologetic, treatises, against, those, decrying, the, holy, images, secured, his, reputation, he, not, only, attacked, the, byzantine, emperor, but, adopted, a, simplified, style, that, allowed, the, controversy, to, be, followed, by, the, common, people, stirring, rebellion, among, the, iconoclasts, decades, after, his, death, john, s, writings, would, play, an, important, role, during, the, second, council, of, nicaea, 787, which, convened, to, settle, the, icon, dispute, leo, iii, reportedly, sent, forged, documents, to, the, caliph, which, implicated, john, in, a, plot, to, attack, damascus, the, caliph, then, ordered, john, s, right, hand, be, cut, off, and, hung, up, in, public, view, some, days, afterwards, john, asked, for, the, restitution, of, his, hand, and, prayed, fervently, to, the, theotokos, before, her, icon, thereupon, his, hand, is, said, to, have, been, miraculously, restored, in, gratitude, for, this, miraculous, healing, he, attached, a, silver, hand, to, the, icon, which, thereafter, became, known, as, the, three, handed, or, tricherousa, that, icon, is, now, located, in, the, hilandar, monastery, of, the, holy, mountain, due, to, his, commitment, to, iconodulism, he, was, condemned, by, anathema, by, the, iconoclastic, council, of, hieria, in, 754, he, was, later, rehabilitated, by, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, when, the, name, of, john, of, damascus, was, inserted, in, the, general, roman, calendar, in, 1890, it, was, assigned, to, 27, march, the, feast, day, was, moved, in, 1969, to, the, day, of, john, s, death, 4, december, the, day, on, which, his, feast, day, is, celebrated, also, in, the, byzantine, rite, calendar, lutheran, commemorations, and, the, anglican, communion, and, episcopal, church, john, of, damascus, is, honored, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, on, 4, december, in, 1890, he, was, declared, a, doctor, of, the, church, by, pope, leo, xiii, besides, his, purely, textual, works, many, of, which, are, listed, below, john, of, damascus, also, composed, hymns, perfecting, the, canon, a, structured, hymn, form, used, in, byzantine, rite, liturgies, as, stated, above, in, the, final, chapter, of, concerning, heresy, john, mentions, islam, as, the, heresy, of, the, ishmaelites, he, is, one, of, the, first, known, christian, critics, of, islam, john, claims, that, muslims, were, once, worshipers, of, aphrodite, who, followed, after, muhammad, because, of, his, seeming, show, of, piety, and, that, mohammad, himself, read, the, bible, and, likewise, it, seems, spoke, to, an, arian, monk, that, taught, him, arianism, instead, of, christianity, john, also, claims, to, have, read, the, quran, or, at, least, parts, of, it, as, he, criticizes, the, quran, for, saying, that, the, virgin, mary, was, the, sister, of, moses, and, aaron, and, that, jesus, was, not, crucified, but, brought, alive, into, heaven, john, further, claims, to, have, spoken, to, muslims, about, mohammad, he, uses, the, plural, we, whether, in, reference, to, himself, or, to, a, group, of, christians, that, he, belonged, to, who, spoke, to, the, muslims, or, in, reference, to, christians, in, general, regardless, john, claims, that, he, asked, the, muslims, what, witnesses, can, testify, that, muhammad, received, the, quran, from, god, since, john, says, moses, received, the, torah, from, god, in, the, presence, of, the, israelites, and, since, islamic, law, mandates, that, a, muslim, can, only, marry, and, do, trade, in, the, presence, of, witnesses, and, what, biblical, prophets, and, verses, foretold, muhammad, s, coming, since, john, says, jesus, was, foretold, by, the, prophets, and, whole, old, testament, john, claims, that, the, muslims, answered, that, muhammad, received, the, quran, in, his, sleep, john, claims, that, he, jokingly, answered, you, re, spinning, my, dreams, some, of, the, muslims, john, says, claimed, that, the, old, testament, that, christians, believe, foretells, jesus, coming, is, misinterpreted, while, other, muslims, claimed, that, the, jews, edited, the, old, testament, so, as, to, deceive, christians, possibly, into, believing, jesus, is, god, but, john, does, not, say, while, recounting, his, alleged, dialogue, with, muslims, john, claims, that, they, have, accused, him, of, idol, worship, for, venerating, the, cross, and, worshipping, jesus, john, claims, that, he, told, the, muslims, that, the, black, stone, in, mecca, was, the, head, of, a, statue, of, aphrodite, moreover, he, claims, the, muslims, would, be, better, off, to, associate, jesus, with, god, if, they, say, jesus, is, the, word, of, god, and, spirit, john, claims, that, the, word, and, the, spirit, are, inseparable, from, that, in, which, they, exist, and, if, the, word, of, god, has, always, existed, in, god, then, the, word, must, be, god, john, ends, the, chapter, by, claiming, that, islam, permits, polygamy, that, muhammad, committed, adultery, with, a, companion, s, wife, before, outlawing, adultery, and, that, the, quran, is, filled, with, stories, such, as, the, she, camel, of, god, and, god, giving, jesus, an, incorruptible, table, it, is, believed, that, the, homily, on, the, annunciation, was, the, first, work, to, be, translated, into, arabic, much, of, this, text, is, found, in, manuscript, 4226, of, the, library, of, strasbourg, france, dating, to, 885, ad, later, in, the, 10th, century, antony, superior, of, the, monastery, of, st, simon, near, antioch, translated, a, corpus, of, john, damascene, in, his, introduction, to, john, s, work, sylvestre, patriarch, of, antioch, 1724, 1766, said, that, antony, was, monk, at, saint, saba, this, could, be, a, misunderstanding, of, the, title, superior, of, saint, simon, probably, because, saint, simon, s, monastery, was, in, ruins, in, the, 18th, century, most, manuscripts, give, the, text, of, the, letter, to, cosmas, the, philosophical, chapters, the, theological, chapters, and, five, other, small, works, in, 1085, mikhael, a, monk, from, antioch, wrote, the, arabic, life, of, the, chrysorrhoas, this, work, was, first, edited, by, bacha, in, 1912, and, then, translated, into, many, languages, german, russian, and, english, two, translations, exist, of, the, 10th, century, hagiographic, novel, barlaam, and, josaphat, traditionally, attributed, to, john, autocephaly, recognized, by, some, autocephalous, churches, de, jure, autocephaly, and, canonicity, recognized, by, constantinople, and, 3, other, autocephalous, churches, spiritual, independence, recognized, by, georgian, orthodox,
