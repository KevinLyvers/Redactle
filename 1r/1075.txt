ab, mu, ammad, abd, all, h, ibn, al, usayn, arabic, 31, july, 874, 4, march, 934, better, known, by, his, regnal, name, al, mahd, bi, ll, h, arabic, the, rightly, guided, by, god, was, the, founder, of, the, isma, ili, fatimid, caliphate, the, only, major, shi, a, caliphate, in, islamic, history, and, the, eleventh, imam, of, the, isma, ili, branch, of, shi, ism, he, was, born, as, sa, d, ibn, al, usayn, in, askar, mukram, to, a, family, that, led, the, secret, isma, ili, missionary, network, da, wa, propagating, on, behalf, of, the, hidden, imam, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, who, would, return, as, the, prophesied, islamic, messiah, mahdi, orphaned, at, a, young, age, he, moved, to, salamiya, the, family, s, base, of, operations, where, he, was, adopted, by, his, uncle, in, the, mid, 890s, sa, id, succeeded, to, the, leadership, of, the, expanding, da, wa, which, had, expanded, and, gained, adherents, across, the, then, muslim, world, however, his, claims, of, not, merely, being, a, trustee, of, the, hidden, imam, but, of, him, and, his, ancestors, holding, the, imamate, itself, led, in, 899, to, a, schism, in, the, isma, ili, movement, those, who, did, not, recognize, his, claims, split, off, to, become, the, qarmatians, the, schism, was, followed, by, uprisings, of, pro, isma, ili, bedouin, in, syria, in, 902, 903, launched, without, his, consent, by, over, eager, supporters, who, aimed, to, force, him, to, come, forward, as, the, mahdi, the, bedouin, uprising, was, suppressed, by, the, abbasids, but, drew, the, attention, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, s, authorities, to, him, forcing, him, to, abandon, salamiya, and, flee, first, to, ramla, then, fustat, in, egypt, and, finally, sijilmasa, in, what, is, now, morocco, there, he, remained, living, as, a, merchant, until, one, of, his, missionaries, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, at, the, head, of, the, kutama, berbers, overthrew, the, aghlabid, dynasty, of, ifriqiya, in, 909, proclaimed, caliph, and, assuming, power, in, ifriqiya, in, january, 910, he, proclaimed, his, right, to, conquer, the, world, in, the, name, of, god, but, soon, fell, out, with, abu, abdallah, and, other, leading, missionaries, who, were, disappointed, that, he, was, not, the, semi, divine, mahdi, they, had, been, propagating, for, al, mahdi, was, able, to, purge, these, dissidents, but, had, to, overcome, a, series, of, revolts, against, his, authority, either, due, to, opposition, to, the, exactions, of, the, kutama, the, backbone, of, his, power, or, due, to, disillusionment, of, his, followers, with, his, failure, to, realise, the, isma, ili, millennialist, promises, the, state, that, al, mahdi, built, although, underpinned, by, a, messianic, ideology, was, otherwise, conventionally, organized, and, relied, heavily, on, the, personnel, of, the, previous, aghlabid, regime, and, the, swords, of, the, kutama, his, expansionist, aims, achieved, only, moderate, success, two, invasions, of, egypt, were, beaten, back, by, the, abbasids, leaving, only, the, cyrenaica, in, his, hands, while, the, war, with, the, byzantine, empire, in, southern, italy, was, characterized, by, raids, for, plunder, and, slaves, and, did, not, result, in, any, lasting, successes, in, the, west, his, repeated, attempts, to, impose, fatimid, rule, over, the, unruly, berbers, were, challenged, not, only, by, berber, rivalries, but, also, by, the, umayyads, of, al, andalus, and, only, secured, temporary, success, in, 921, he, moved, his, court, to, the, newly, built, fortified, palace, city, of, mahdiya, on, the, tunisian, coast, and, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, there, after, his, death, in, 934, he, was, succeeded, by, his, only, son, al, qa, im, the, origin, identity, and, early, history, of, the, man, who, founded, the, fatimid, caliphate, is, obscure, and, even, his, name, and, the, place, and, date, of, his, birth, are, disputed, according, to, his, official, biography, he, was, born, in, askar, mukram, in, the, persian, province, of, khuzistan, on, 31, july, 874, 12, shawwal, 260, ah, or, exactly, one, year, earlier, according, to, a, different, tradition, other, traditions, report, that, he, was, born, in, baghdad, or, kufa, in, iraq, or, the, town, of, salamiya, on, the, western, edge, of, the, syrian, desert, his, original, name, most, likely, was, sa, id, ibn, al, husayn, although, in, later, life, he, insisted, that, is, real, name, was, ali, and, sa, id, was, just, a, cover, name, his, father, died, in, 881, 2, and, sa, id, was, sent, to, be, fostered, by, his, uncle, abu, ali, muhammad, also, known, as, abu, l, shalaghlagh, at, salamiya, on, his, journey, he, was, joined, by, ja, far, a, boy, who, was, a, few, months, older, than, sa, id, and, had, been, reared, with, him, by, the, same, wet, nurse, he, became, a, eunuch, and, sa, id, s, close, confidant, and, chamberlain, and, is, one, of, the, main, sources, about, his, life, a, younger, brother, known, only, as, abu, muhammad, did, not, follow, sa, id, to, salamiya, abu, l, shalaghlagh, and, sa, id, lived, the, life, of, a, wealthy, merchant, household, but, in, secret, the, family, headed, an, underground, political, and, religious, movement, the, isma, ili, da, wa, invitation, calling, this, movement, was, part, of, the, wider, imami, branch, of, the, shi, a, which, held, that, the, leadership, of, the, muslim, community, was, entrusted, by, god, to, a, singular, divinely, invested, and, guided, imam, leader, the, first, such, imam, was, ali, ibn, abi, talib, the, son, in, law, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, fourth, caliph, who, according, to, the, shi, a, had, been, designated, as, successor, by, muhammad, only, for, this, instruction, to, be, ignored, by, the, latter, s, companions, who, chose, abu, bakr, as, caliph, instead, shi, a, doctrine, holds, that, the, imamate, was, the, birthright, of, ali, s, descendants, via, fatima, muhammad, s, daughter, the, imamis, hold, that, the, existence, of, an, imam, at, all, times, is, a, necessity, for, the, world, s, existence, as, the, imam, is, the, proof, of, god, and, has, the, sole, authority, and, divine, inspiration, to, interpret, god, s, revelation, indeed, the, imam, is, considered, to, be, infallible, at, least, in, doctrinal, matters, the, imamis, especially, held, that, the, imamate, was, the, preserve, of, the, husaynid, line, of, the, alids, where, it, could, only, be, passed, in, hereditary, succession, from, father, to, son, via, an, explicit, act, of, designation, nass, by, the, previous, imam, a, choice, that, is, held, to, have, been, ordained, by, god, in, 765, a, succession, conflict, gave, rise, to, the, split, of, the, imami, shi, a, into, isma, ilis, and, twelvers, the, sixth, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, died, without, a, clear, successor, al, sadiq, had, most, likely, designated, his, second, son, isma, il, after, whom, the, isma, ilis, are, named, but, according, to, most, accounts, isma, il, predeceased, his, father, some, of, al, sadiq, s, followers, then, held, that, the, designation, automatically, passed, on, to, isma, il, s, son, muhammad, or, even, that, al, sadiq, had, designated, his, grandson, while, he, lived, while, others, claimed, that, isma, il, himself, was, not, dead, and, merely, in, hiding, to, escape, persecution, by, the, ruling, abbasid, caliphate, most, of, al, sadiq, s, followers, however, followed, isma, il, s, younger, brother, musa, al, kazim, and, his, descendants, becoming, the, twelver, branch, of, shi, ism, according, to, his, followers, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, fled, the, hejaz, and, went, into, concealment, satr, to, escape, both, abbasid, persecution, as, well, as, the, hostility, of, his, uncle, s, supporters, he, died, sometime, c, 795, in, khuzistan, after, which, the, fate, of, the, isma, ili, movement, is, obscure, until, it, re, emerged, in, the, late, ninth, century, during, the, second, half, of, the, ninth, century, a, wave, of, millennialist, expectations, spread, in, the, muslim, world, coinciding, with, a, deep, crisis, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, anarchy, at, samarra, in, the, 860s, followed, by, the, zanj, rebellion, enfeebled, the, abbasid, regime, allowing, the, rise, of, breakaway, and, autonomous, regimes, in, the, provinces, belief, in, a, messiah, of, alid, descent, the, mahdi, the, rightly, guided, one, or, qa, im, he, who, arises, who, would, usher, in, the, end, times, was, widespread, in, the, early, islamic, world, according, to, the, various, traditions, heralding, his, coming, the, mahdi, would, rapidly, overthrow, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, destroy, their, capital, baghdad, restore, the, unity, of, the, muslims, conquer, constantinople, capital, of, the, byzantine, empire, the, oldest, non, muslim, antagonist, of, the, early, caliphates, ensure, the, final, triumph, of, islam, and, establish, a, reign, of, peace, and, justice, thus, the, leader, of, the, zanj, uprising, claimed, alid, descent, and, proclaimed, himself, as, the, mahdi, the, restorer, of, heavenly, justice, to, those, downtrodden, and, disenfranchised, as, the, historian, michael, brett, comments, the, mahdist, expectations, were, focused, upon, the, coming, of, a, more, and, more, mysterious, increasingly, supernatural, ultimately, eschatological, figure, in, the, form, of, a, second, muhammad, destined, to, complete, the, history, of, the, world, for, the, isma, ilis, the, expected, mahdi, was, none, other, than, their, hidden, imam, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, while, the, imam, remained, hidden, however, he, was, represented, towards, his, followers, by, an, agent, living, proof, of, the, imam, s, existence, the, hujja, lit, seal, that, was, the, role, claimed, according, to, later, sources, by, sa, id, s, great, grandfather, abdallah, al, akbar, leaving, his, native, askar, mukram, after, some, wanderings, abdallah, al, akbar, had, settled, in, salamiya, from, where, he, and, his, successors, directed, the, growth, of, the, da, wa, according, to, later, isma, ili, tradition, and, the, reconstruction, of, modern, scholars, abdallah, al, akbar, was, in, turn, succeeded, in, 827, 8, by, his, son, ahmad, followed, by, ahmad, s, son, abu, l, shalaghlagh, it, is, possible, however, that, the, origins, of, the, salamiya, based, movement, were, far, more, recent, than, that, and, that, it, had, come, about, only, following, the, start, of, the, anti, alid, and, anti, shi, a, policies, adopted, by, the, abbasids, under, caliph, al, mutawakkil, r, 847, 861, these, policies, led, not, only, to, a, series, of, alid, shi, a, uprisings, in, the, decades, that, followed, but, also, the, increasing, persecution, of, the, twelver, imams, until, the, disappearance, and, supposed, occultation, of, the, last, twelver, imam, in, 874, it, is, exactly, this, period, which, saw, the, isma, ili, message, of, the, imminent, return, of, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, as, the, mahdi, gain, traction, aided, by, dissatisfaction, among, the, twelver, adherents, with, the, political, quietism, of, their, leadership, and, above, all, the, vacuum, left, by, the, occultation, that, removed, a, visible, and, accessible, imam, as, a, source, of, loyalty, and, religious, guidance, despite, its, activity, this, stage, of, the, isma, ili, movement, is, scarcely, covered, in, later, isma, ili, sources, and, most, of, what, happened, in, the, last, decades, of, the, ninth, century, culminating, in, the, qarmatian, schism, of, 899, has, been, reconstructed, and, elaborated, by, a, succession, of, modern, scholars, chiefly, vladimir, ivanov, samuel, miklos, stern, wilferd, madelung, and, heinz, halm, using, mostly, anti, fatimid, polemic, works, according, to, this, version, isma, ili, da, i, s, led, by, hamdan, qarmat, and, his, brother, in, law, abdan, spread, their, network, of, agents, to, the, area, around, kufa, in, the, late, 870s, and, from, there, to, persia, and, khurasan, while, a, particularly, important, role, was, played, by, yemen, whence, the, isma, ili, agent, ibn, hawshab, sent, missionaries, to, sindh, al, haytham, 883, 84, bahrayn, abu, sa, id, al, jannabi, 899, and, ifriqiya, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, 893, in, medieval, sources, as, well, as, modern, accounts, building, on, them, all, this, activity, is, attributed, to, a, single, unified, movement, a, secret, revolutionary, organization, carrying, on, intensive, missionary, efforts, in, many, regions, of, the, muslim, world, according, to, wilferd, madelung, this, was, the, movement, headed, by, abu, l, shalaghlagh, at, salamiya, the, true, head, of, this, movement, remained, hidden, even, from, the, senior, missionaries, and, a, certain, fayruz, functioned, as, chief, missionary, da, i, al, du, at, and, gateway, bab, to, the, hidden, leader, brett, however, cautions, that, this, grand, conspiracy, theory, of, fatimid, origins, reflects, mostly, the, bias, of, later, sources, pro, fatimid, as, well, as, anti, fatimid, and, that, it, obscures, a, reality, of, multiple, separately, evolving, millennarian, movements, that, existed, at, the, time, and, whose, political, or, doctrinal, relation, to, one, another, is, now, difficult, to, reconstruct, according, to, brett, the, movement, at, salamiya, was, one, of, many, and, only, after, the, establishment, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, were, these, movements, united, into, a, single, coherent, network, retrospectively, by, fatimid, and, anti, fatimid, propaganda, alike, indeed, modern, scholars, point, out, the, existence, of, independent, strands, of, isma, ili, thought, in, the, eastern, regions, of, the, islamic, world, propagated, by, missionaries, like, abu, hatim, al, razi, d, 934, 5, in, adharbayjan, and, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, al, nasafi, d, 943, in, khurasan, it, was, only, later, during, the, second, half, of, the, 10th, century, that, some, of, these, isma, ili, communities, were, reconciled, to, fatimid, leadership, with, the, official, fatimid, doctrine, coming, to, incorporate, many, of, their, teachings, abu, l, shalaghlagh, did, not, have, heirs, as, his, son, and, grandchild, had, reportedly, been, captured, and, imprisoned, by, the, abbasids, sa, id, was, thus, designated, as, his, successor, and, given, his, uncle, s, daughter, in, marriage, sa, id, s, only, child, abd, al, rahman, the, future, caliph, al, qa, im, bi, amr, allah, was, born, in, march, or, april, 893, his, brother, abu, muhammad, apparently, went, to, taleqan, in, the, daylam, a, region, where, already, abdallah, al, akbar, had, lived, and, preached, for, a, while, the, eunuch, ja, far, reports, that, abu, l, shalaghlagh, perhaps, encouraged, by, the, rapid, progress, of, the, da, wa, which, was, now, establishing, armed, strongholds, in, preparation, of, the, mahdi, s, arrival, secretly, declared, himself, to, a, few, senior, members, of, the, da, wa, not, as, the, hujja, for, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, but, the, actual, imam, and, that, he, claimed, for, his, nephew, sa, id, the, title, of, mahdi, and, for, the, latter, s, infant, son, abd, al, rahman, the, title, of, qa, im, this, claim, was, taken, up, by, sa, id, when, he, succeeded, his, uncle, although, later, fatimid, doctrine, insisted, that, sa, id, s, father, al, husayn, had, been, a, hidden, imam, in, succession, to, ahmad, ibn, abdallah, al, akbar, rather, than, abu, l, shalaghlagh, the, latter, in, turn, is, accused, in, these, works, of, trying, to, usurp, the, position, of, sa, id, various, genealogies, were, later, put, forth, by, the, fatimids, and, their, followers, to, justify, their, claim, to, the, imamate, generating, a, heated, controversy, that, lasts, until, the, present, day, in, the, most, common, version, abdallah, al, akbar, was, proclaimed, to, be, the, son, of, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, but, even, in, pro, isma, ili, sources, the, succession, line, and, names, of, the, hidden, imams, who, supposedly, preceded, sa, id, are, not, the, same, partly, due, to, the, isma, ili, practice, of, using, codenames, and, hiding, their, identity, taqiya, to, avoid, persecution, anti, isma, ili, sunni, and, twelver, shi, a, sources, naturally, rejected, the, claim, of, fatimid, descent, from, ali, ibn, abi, talib, altogether, and, considered, them, as, impostors, some, even, claiming, they, were, of, jewish, descent, the, situation, is, further, complicated, by, the, use, of, the, title, qa, im, until, then, a, synonym, for, the, mahdi, for, sa, id, s, son, this, has, led, to, claims, already, in, medieval, times, that, whereas, abd, al, rahman, was, a, genuine, imam, sa, id, descended, from, a, line, of, hujja, s, and, was, neither, abd, al, rahman, s, father, nor, a, legitimate, imam, but, merely, a, usurping, steward, abu, l, shalaghlagh, died, sometime, after, 893, and, sa, id, became, the, head, of, the, da, wa, in, 899, the, letters, being, sent, to, the, senior, missionaries, from, salamiya, revealed, changes, in, the, official, doctrine, of, the, movement, this, worried, hamdan, qarmat, who, sent, his, brother, in, law, to, salamiya, to, investigate, the, matter, it, was, only, there, that, abdan, learned, of, the, new, claim, that, the, hidden, imam, was, not, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, as, commonly, believed, but, sa, id, upon, learning, of, this, hamdan, denounced, the, leadership, in, salamiya, gathered, the, iraqi, da, i, s, and, ordered, them, to, cease, the, missionary, effort, shortly, after, he, disappeared, from, his, headquarters, and, abdan, was, assassinated, at, the, instigation, of, zakarawayh, ibn, mihrawayh, who, had, apparently, remained, loyal, to, salamiya, these, events, caused, a, major, split, in, the, isma, ili, movement, between, those, who, recognized, sa, id, s, claims, to, the, imamate, and, those, who, rejected, them, the, latter, are, generally, known, today, by, the, term, qarmatians, although, the, original, connotation, of, the, name, is, unclear, and, was, also, applied, by, non, isma, ili, authors, to, the, supporters, of, the, fatimids, as, well, the, isma, ili, communities, that, adhered, to, the, qarmatian, view, represented, mostly, the, eastern, islamic, world, iraq, bahrayn, and, northern, persia, around, rayy, while, the, communities, in, yemen, sindh, ifriqiya, and, possibly, khurasan, remained, loyal, to, salamiya, after, his, role, in, the, murder, of, abdan, zakarawayh, ibn, mihrawayh, escaped, from, iraq, and, resumed, his, missionary, efforts, among, the, bedouin, tribes, of, the, eastern, syrian, desert, but, with, little, success, his, sons, al, husayn, and, yahya, however, succeeded, in, converting, many, members, of, the, tribal, group, of, the, banu, kalb, in, the, northwestern, syrian, desert, assuming, the, cover, names, of, sahib, al, shama, man, with, the, mole, and, sahib, al, naqa, master, of, the, she, camel, respectively, they, and, their, followers, adopted, the, name, al, fatimiyyun, fatimids, and, rose, in, revolt, in, 902, it, remains, a, matter, of, contention, whether, zakarawayh, and, his, sons, were, followers, of, sa, id, and, acted, in, his, name, as, contended, by, ivanov, and, halm, or, unrelated, the, account, of, the, contemporary, baghdadi, official, and, historian, al, tabari, knows, nothing, of, the, isma, ili, leadership, at, salamiya, and, provides, a, garbled, account, of, the, rebels, belief, system, claiming, that, a, certain, faraj, ibn, uthman, was, their, mahdi, while, the, 11th, century, pro, fatimid, narrative, of, al, naysaburi, insists, that, the, revolt, was, instigated, by, the, three, renegade, sons, of, an, isma, ili, da, i, whatever, the, truth, the, uprising, was, apparently, without, the, knowledge, or, authorization, of, sa, id, although, later, fatimid, sources, claim, that, zakarawayh, sent, sa, id, s, brother, to, the, bedouin, as, the, representative, of, the, hidden, imam, and, figurehead, of, the, revolt, indeed, the, revolt, whether, by, over, eager, followers, or, not, placed, sa, id, in, mortal, danger, as, it, alerted, the, authorities, to, the, danger, posed, by, militant, isma, ilism, and, revealed, the, whereabouts, of, the, leadership, of, the, da, wa, it, also, led, to, the, renewed, direct, abbasid, military, involvement, in, syria, which, for, the, last, thirty, years, had, been, ruled, not, by, baghdad, but, by, the, autonomous, tulunid, dynasty, based, in, fustat, in, egypt, while, the, bedouin, scored, their, first, successes, against, government, troops, sa, id, was, informed, via, pigeon, post, from, his, agents, in, baghdad, that, the, abbasid, governor, of, salamiya, had, discovered, his, true, identity, under, cover, of, night, sa, id, left, the, town, accompanied, only, by, his, son, the, chief, missionary, fayruz, and, four, slaves, the, women, of, the, household, including, his, mother, and, two, daughters, as, well, as, his, niece, were, left, behind, under, the, protection, of, the, slave, su, luk, the, group, speedily, went, south, in, three, days, they, passed, homs, tripoli, damascus, and, tiberias, until, they, reached, ramla, where, the, local, governor, was, secretly, an, isma, ili, initiate, and, could, protect, them, sa, id, and, his, party, had, escaped, in, the, nick, of, time, in, damascus, the, caliphal, courier, with, his, description, and, orders, for, his, arrest, arrived, right, after, they, had, left, the, city, and, another, courier, arrived, at, ramla, in, the, same, evening, that, they, settled, there, in, the, meantime, zakarawayh, s, sons, had, made, for, salamiya, to, pay, homage, to, their, master, according, to, pro, fatimid, sources, or, because, the, town, had, been, settled, with, hashemite, families, related, to, the, abbasid, dynasty, as, al, tabari, claims, according, to, the, detailed, accounts, of, pro, fatimid, sources, the, two, brothers, initially, held, abu, muhammad, to, be, their, imam, until, the, women, of, the, household, corrected, them, yahya, went, on, to, lay, siege, to, damascus, while, al, husayn, reportedly, went, to, ramla, to, meet, sa, id, although, later, fatimid, sources, are, at, pains, to, disassociate, sa, id, from, the, brothers, uprising, sa, id, at, that, time, may, have, condoned, their, operations, and, even, ordered, money, to, be, paid, to, them, after, the, death, of, yahya, before, damascus, in, july, 903, al, husayn, abandoned, the, siege, and, turned, north, he, captured, salamiya, homs, and, other, towns, and, in, the, expectation, that, the, mahdi, would, finally, come, forth, began, to, establish, the, institutions, of, a, state, at, the, mint, of, homs, coins, were, issued, on, behalf, of, the, yet, unnamed, mahdi, and, in, the, friday, sermon, the, name, of, the, abbasid, caliph, al, muktafi, was, dropped, in, favour, of, the, successor, the, rightly, guided, heir, the, lord, of, the, age, the, commander, of, the, faithful, the, mahdi, encamped, at, salamiya, since, august, 903, the, bedouin, apparently, expected, that, sa, id, would, return, and, announce, himself, despite, repeated, entreaties, however, sa, id, refused, to, leave, the, safety, of, ramla, al, tabari, preserves, two, letters, one, sent, to, the, shadowy, mahdi, and, one, from, him, that, were, captured, by, abbasid, troops, in, which, the, mahdi, is, named, abdallah, ibn, ahmad, ibn, abdallah, if, this, was, indeed, sa, id, he, thus, had, by, this, time, assumed, his, eventual, regnal, name, while, apparently, omitting, his, father, s, in, the, end, the, abbasid, government, sent, an, army, under, muhammad, ibn, sulayman, al, katib, which, on, 29, november, 903, routed, the, fatimid, bedouin, army, at, the, battle, of, hama, enraged, about, the, apparent, abandonment, by, the, supposed, divinely, guided, imam, al, husayn, turned, against, him, the, residence, at, salamiya, was, destroyed, and, all, family, members, and, servants, encountered, there, executed, sa, id, s, women, however, were, rescued, by, sul, uk, who, eventually, brought, them, to, rejoin, his, master, upon, the, conquest, of, ifriqiya, this, atrocity, along, with, the, failure, of, the, uprising, led, later, fatimid, historians, to, try, and, excise, sa, id, s, relationship, with, the, sons, of, zakarawayh, in, what, the, historian, heinz, halm, calls, an, act, of, damnatio, memoriae, al, husayn, himself, was, captured, shortly, after, and, under, torture, revealed, what, he, knew, about, the, leader, of, the, isma, ili, movement, zakarawayh, himself, remained, at, large, and, in, 906, tried, to, revive, the, uprising, in, iraq, in, a, movement, that, according, to, historian, farhad, daftary, now, acquired, the, characteristics, of, dissident, qarmatism, this, revolt, too, was, defeated, in, 907, by, abbasid, forces, and, zakarawayh, was, captured, and, died, of, his, wounds, shortly, after, once, again, sa, id, and, his, entourage, had, to, flee, the, abbasid, manhunt, making, for, tulunid, egypt, sa, id, arrived, in, fustat, the, capital, of, egypt, in, early, 904, and, settled, there, in, the, house, of, a, local, convert, with, the, help, of, the, local, da, i, abu, ali, according, to, the, generally, considered, reliable, report, of, ibn, hawqal, the, latter, was, none, other, than, hamdan, qarmat, who, had, returned, to, sa, id, s, allegiance, sa, id, assumed, the, guise, of, a, wealthy, hashemite, merchant, but, local, authorities, warned, by, baghdad, became, suspicious, the, loyal, eunuch, ja, far, was, even, questioned, under, torture, but, revealed, nothing, sa, id, remained, in, fustat, until, january, 905, when, the, abbasid, troops, under, muhammad, ibn, sulayman, al, katib, invaded, egypt, and, ended, the, tulunid, regime, bringing, the, province, once, again, directly, under, abbasid, control, to, escape, the, abbasids, sa, id, was, once, again, forced, to, flee, his, entourage, apparently, expected, him, to, head, to, yemen, where, the, missionaries, ibn, hawshab, and, ibn, al, fadl, had, conquered, most, of, the, country, in, the, name, of, the, isma, ili, imam, instead, sa, id, resolved, to, turn, west, to, the, maghreb, much, to, the, surprise, and, dismay, of, his, followers, while, yemen, was, part, of, the, civilized, arab, world, the, maghreb, was, wild, and, uncultured, far, from, the, centres, of, the, islamic, world, politically, fractured, and, dominated, by, berber, tribes, indeed, the, chief, missionary, fayruz, abandoned, his, master, and, made, for, yemen, on, his, own, the, reason, for, sa, id, s, choice, is, unknown, but, the, historian, wilferd, madelung, suggests, that, he, had, doubts, about, ibn, al, fadl, s, loyalty, the, latter, would, indeed, eventually, renounce, his, allegiance, and, declare, himself, to, be, the, awaited, mahdi, at, the, same, time, however, the, situation, in, the, maghreb, was, promising, the, da, i, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, had, converted, the, kutama, berbers, to, his, cause, and, by, 905, had, achieved, some, first, victories, against, the, autonomous, aghlabid, dynasty, that, ruled, ifriqiya, modern, tunisia, and, eastern, algeria, under, nominal, abbasid, suzerainty, the, later, fatimid, apologist, qadi, al, nu, man, insists, that, abu, abdallah, had, already, sent, messengers, to, salamiya, inviting, his, master, to, the, maghreb, in, an, effort, to, make, the, decision, appear, foreordained, but, as, halm, and, brett, have, remarked, the, episode, throws, light, on, the, improvised, manner, in, which, sa, id, appears, to, have, run, his, movement, sending, the, trustworthy, ja, far, back, to, salamiya, to, dig, up, the, treasures, hidden, there, sa, id, joined, a, merchant, caravan, going, west, accompanied, by, abu, abdallah, s, brother, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, on, the, way, the, caravan, was, attacked, by, berber, tribes, which, left, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, wounded, and, sa, id, s, library, and, many, of, his, possessions, in, the, hands, of, their, attackers, the, party, made, a, stop, at, tripoli, where, they, waited, for, ja, far, to, join, them, with, the, recovered, treasure, in, the, meantime, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, was, sent, ahead, to, kairouan, the, aghlabid, capital, unbeknownst, to, him, news, of, sa, id, and, his, identity, as, one, sought, by, the, abbasid, government, had, already, reached, the, city, and, he, was, immediately, arrested, as, a, result, once, again, sa, id, had, to, alter, his, plans, instead, of, crossing, the, aghlabid, domains, and, making, for, the, country, of, the, kutama, he, joined, another, caravan, heading, west, skirting, the, southern, fringes, of, aghlabid, territory, he, was, accompanied, only, by, his, son, and, ja, far, pressuring, and, even, bribing, the, caravan, leader, to, make, haste, they, eventually, arrived, in, sijilmasa, an, oasis, town, in, modern, eastern, morocco, sijilmasa, was, the, terminus, of, several, trans, sahara, trade, routes, and, far, from, the, reach, of, the, aghlabid, emirs, indeed, its, midrarid, ruler, al, yasa, ibn, midrar, like, most, berbers, espoused, kharijism, making, them, foes, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, posing, once, again, as, a, wealthy, merchant, sa, id, bought, a, nice, residence, in, the, city, and, was, slowly, joined, by, the, rest, of, his, household, over, the, following, months, there, he, remained, for, the, next, four, years, continuing, his, mercantile, activities, which, apparently, brought, him, additional, wealth, all, the, while, remaining, in, contact, with, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, who, now, embarked, on, the, conquest, of, ifriqiya, his, identity, did, not, remain, a, secret, for, too, long, the, aghlabid, emir, ziyadat, allah, iii, informed, the, midrarid, emir, of, the, true, nature, of, the, merchant, from, the, east, but, aided, by, rich, gifts, from, sa, id, the, emir, of, sijilmasa, saw, no, reason, to, do, anything, about, it, already, before, the, conquest, of, the, aghabid, emirate, was, complete, abu, abdallah, sent, a, troop, of, kutama, to, escort, sa, id, to, ifriqiya, but, they, were, waylaid, by, the, rustamid, emir, of, tahert, and, had, to, turn, back, on, 18, march, 909, the, kutama, under, the, da, i, abu, abdallah, decisively, defeated, the, last, aghlabid, army, at, al, aribus, the, next, day, ziyadat, allah, iii, fled, his, palace, city, of, raqqada, for, egypt, taking, many, of, his, treasures, with, him, but, leaving, most, of, his, extensive, harem, behind, and, taking, care, to, torch, the, offices, of, the, land, tax, department, and, all, fiscal, records, contained, therein, chaos, broke, out, once, this, became, known, as, the, palaces, were, ransacked, and, any, thought, of, further, resistance, vanished, a, delegation, of, notables, surrendered, kairouan, and, on, the, next, day, 25, march, 909, abu, abdallah, entered, raqqada, and, took, up, residence, in, the, palace, of, the, emir, as, his, master, was, still, in, faraway, sijilmasa, it, was, up, to, abu, abdallah, to, establish, the, new, shi, a, regime, in, ifriqiya, he, issued, a, letter, of, pardon, aman, to, the, citizens, of, kairouan, and, all, former, servants, of, the, aghlabid, regime, took, stock, of, the, contents, of, the, palaces, installed, governors, and, ordered, changes, to, the, coinage, calls, to, prayer, and, the, sermon, and, official, seals, to, reflect, the, new, regime, the, new, ruler, was, not, yet, named, in, public, instead, the, new, formulas, used, quranic, verses, or, paraphrases, that, exalted, the, family, of, muhammad, the, fulfillment, of, god, s, promise, the, victory, of, god, s, truth, haqq, and, of, the, proof, of, god, hujjat, allah, i, e, the, mahdi, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, who, had, escaped, from, prison, and, emerged, from, hiding, after, his, brother, s, victory, began, to, spread, the, isma, ili, doctrine, holding, disputations, with, the, local, sunni, jurists, in, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, abu, abdallah, also, chose, a, new, chief, qadi, judge, in, the, person, of, the, local, shi, ite, muhammad, ibn, umar, al, marwarrudhi, as, soon, as, his, rule, was, stable, enough, on, 6, june, 909, abu, aballah, set, out, from, raqqada, at, the, head, of, a, large, army, to, find, his, master, and, hand, over, power, to, him, in, his, stead, at, raqqada, he, left, abu, zaki, tammam, ibn, mu, arik, with, his, brother, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, as, his, aide, on, the, way, abu, abdallah, received, the, submission, of, muhammad, ibn, khazar, leader, of, the, nomadic, zenata, berbers, and, overthrew, the, rustamid, imamate, at, tahert, installing, a, kutama, governor, there, learning, of, the, approach, of, the, kutama, army, the, emir, of, sijilmasa, had, sa, id, questioned, and, put, under, house, arrest, along, with, his, son, but, otherwise, treated, well, their, servants, on, the, other, hand, were, thrown, into, prison, and, regularly, whipped, on, 26, august, 909, the, kutama, army, reached, sijilmasa, and, demanded, the, release, of, their, captive, imam, after, brief, clashes, with, the, midrarid, troops, emir, al, yasa, fled, his, city, which, was, occupied, and, plundered, mounted, on, horseback, and, dressed, in, fine, clothes, sa, id, and, his, son, were, presented, to, the, army, amidst, shouts, and, tears, of, religious, exaltation, on, the, next, day, 27, august, sa, id, was, enthroned, and, acclaimed, by, the, troops, as, the, historian, michael, brett, explains, the, occasion, had, double, meaning, on, the, one, hand, it, acknowledged, sa, id, s, caliphate, but, on, the, other, it, recognized, the, kutama, soldiery, as, faithful, mu, minin, or, friends, of, god, awliya, an, elite, distinct, from, the, mass, of, ordinary, muslims, on, 26, august, outside, the, walls, of, sijilmasa, the, imam, emerged, he, was, riding, a, bay, horse, and, wearing, a, turban, whose, cloth, trailed, over, his, neck, and, shoulders, an, egyptian, linen, shirt, and, sandals, just, then, a, voice, rang, out, over, the, crowds, of, the, kutama, tribesmen, o, faithful, this, is, my, lord, and, yours, and, the, lord, of, all, mankind, when, the, kutama, saw, their, chief, abu, abd, allah, al, shi, i, dismount, from, his, horse, they, followed, suit, al, shi, i, rushed, towards, the, imam, falling, to, his, knees, to, kiss, the, stirrup, of, the, imam, s, horse, tears, streaming, down, his, face, as, he, wept, with, joy, then, he, heard, the, first, of, abd, allah, al, mahdi, s, words, rejoice, in, the, glad, tidings, the, army, remained, at, sijilmasa, for, several, weeks, during, which, delegations, offering, submission, came, from, across, the, western, maghreb, the, fugitive, emir, of, sijilmasa, was, captured, and, the, kutama, chieftain, ibrahim, ibn, ghalib, installed, as, governor, on, 12, october, the, army, began, its, return, march, on, the, way, it, relieved, tahert, which, in, the, meantime, had, come, under, attack, by, the, zenata, under, ibn, khazar, attacked, the, tribe, of, sadina, in, its, mountain, strongholds, and, launched, an, expedition, to, capture, ibn, khazar, but, the, latter, managed, to, flee, into, the, desert, the, army, then, turned, northeast, and, sa, id, visited, ikjan, the, original, base, of, abu, abdallah, s, mission, among, the, kutama, there, sa, id, arranged, the, affairs, of, the, kutama, tribes, and, took, care, to, gather, the, treasures, that, had, for, years, been, hoarded, in, his, name, after, twenty, days, the, army, marched, on, towards, kairouan, where, on, 4, january, 910, the, city, notables, came, forth, to, greet, their, new, ruler, asked, for, a, renewal, of, abu, abdallah, s, aman, sa, id, immediately, guaranteed, their, lives, but, pointedly, did, not, say, anything, about, their, possessions, the, new, caliph, did, not, enter, kairouan, which, he, seems, never, to, have, visited, during, his, life, and, instead, rode, straight, for, raqqada, on, the, next, day, friday, 5, january, 910, in, the, sermon, of, the, friday, prayer, a, manifesto, hailing, the, return, of, the, caliphate, to, its, rightful, possessors, the, family, of, muhammad, was, read, and, the, name, and, titles, of, the, new, ruler, were, formally, announced, abdallah, abu, muhammad, the, imam, rightly, guided, by, god, the, commander, of, the, faithful, states, people, centers, other, the, proclamation, of, al, mahdi, as, caliph, was, the, culmination, of, the, decades, long, efforts, of, the, isma, ili, da, wa, and, the, first, time, since, the, caliphate, of, ali, ibn, abi, talib, 656, 661, that, a, member, of, the, family, of, muhammad, governed, a, major, part, of, the, muslim, world, the, establishment, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, was, part, of, a, wider, rise, of, shi, a, regimes, in, the, 10th, century, muslim, world, the, so, called, shi, a, century, which, included, the, zaydi, principalities, in, yemen, and, tabaristan, the, hamdanids, in, syria, and, the, buyids, in, persia, and, iraq, as, shi, a, imams, al, mahdi, and, his, successors, were, not, only, the, secular, rulers, of, a, state, dawla, but, concurrently, also, shi, a, imams, at, the, head, of, the, still, extant, and, wide, ranging, network, of, the, da, wa, and, thus, posed, a, direct, ideological, challenge, to, the, sunni, abbasids, for, the, leadership, of, the, entire, islamic, world, already, in, his, inaugural, proclamation, al, mahdi, claimed, a, mandate, to, conquer, the, world, to, east, and, west, in, accordance, with, god, s, promise, from, sinful, rebels, however, in, those, universalist, claims, lay, the, very, problem, of, the, new, regime, as, the, historian, hugh, kennedy, writes, the, moment, when, a, revolutionary, movement, achieves, power, is, always, of, crucial, importance, since, it, has, to, fulfill, its, promises, to, its, followers, al, mahdi, had, come, to, power, riding, a, wave, of, millennialist, and, messianic, promises, his, followers, expecting, a, divinely, inspired, leader, capable, of, performing, miracles, once, in, power, however, he, would, prove, to, be, a, mere, mortal, and, focused, more, on, his, legitimist, claim, on, the, caliphate, as, a, descendant, of, ali, rather, than, attempting, to, fulfill, the, overblown, expectations, placed, on, the, proof, of, god, that, abu, abdallah, had, heralded, the, way, that, al, mahdi, tried, to, manage, expectations, can, be, seen, in, the, choice, of, his, regnal, name, abdallah, abu, muhammad, was, the, exact, reverse, of, the, name, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, also, ensured, that, his, son, now, known, as, abu, l, qasim, muhammad, rather, than, abd, al, rahman, would, bear, the, same, name, as, the, islamic, prophet, as, had, long, been, prophesied, for, the, mahdi, abu, l, qasim, muhammad, ibn, abdallah, as, halm, points, out, this, allowed, al, mahdi, to, shift, the, millennialist, expectations, of, his, followers, onto, his, son, buying, time, at, the, same, time, however, this, also, meant, that, the, singular, semi, divine, figure, of, the, mahdi, was, now, reduced, to, an, adjective, in, a, caliphal, title, the, imam, rightly, guided, by, god, al, imam, al, mahdi, bi, llah, instead, of, the, promised, messiah, al, mahdi, was, merely, one, in, a, long, sequence, of, imams, descending, from, ali, and, fatima, a, major, problem, faced, by, al, mahdi, was, the, narrow, basis, of, the, new, regime, the, fatimid, dynasty, was, brought, to, power, by, the, kutama, who, were, according, to, brett, indispensable, but, also, a, liability, and, a, threat, to, its, survival, halm, has, described, the, early, fatimid, regime, as, being, little, more, than, a, hegemony, of, the, kutama, the, position, of, these, semi, civilized, tribesmen, as, the, chosen, warriors, of, the, imam, caliph, was, greatly, resented, not, only, by, the, other, berber, tribes, but, chiefly, by, the, inhabitants, of, the, cities, where, the, arabic, culture, predominated, as, halm, writes, the, situation, was, similar, to, a, scenario, where, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, north, america, the, iroquois, converted, to, catholicism, by, jesuit, missionaries, had, overrun, the, puritan, provinces, of, new, england, installed, their, chieftains, as, governors, in, boston, providence, and, hartford, and, proclaimed, a, european, with, dubious, credentials, as, king, of, england, in, kairouan, and, the, old, aghlabid, palace, city, of, al, qasr, al, qadim, therefore, local, arabs, were, appointed, al, hasan, ibn, ahmad, ibn, abi, khinzir, and, his, brother, khalaf, in, the, provinces, where, kutama, governors, were, appointed, the, first, years, of, fatimid, rule, were, marked, by, revolts, by, the, local, inhabitants, against, the, arrogance, and, exactions, of, the, kutama, while, he, appointed, the, kutama, to, garrisons, and, governorships, and, gave, them, rich, rewards, in, order, to, administer, his, new, state, al, mahdi, required, the, expertise, of, the, arab, urban, population, as, kennedy, remarks, unlike, the, regimes, of, later, radical, isma, ili, groups, al, mahdi, s, administration, was, surprisingly, conventional, for, this, purpose, al, mahdi, had, to, take, over, most, of, the, personnel, of, the, aghlabid, emirs, often, men, of, dubious, loyalty, like, ibn, al, qadim, the, latter, had, initially, followed, ziyadat, allah, iii, into, exile, only, to, abandon, him, and, return, to, ifriqiya, with, a, considerable, portion, of, the, former, emir, s, treasure, al, mahdi, now, appointed, him, to, two, crucial, posts, as, head, of, the, land, tax, bureau, diwan, al, kharaj, and, of, the, postal, service, barid, the, new, caliph, established, a, series, of, new, fiscal, departments, in, emulation, of, abbasid, practice, but, notably, not, a, vizierate, instead, using, the, post, of, secretary, katib, to, supervise, the, function, of, his, government, this, post, was, held, initially, by, a, holdover, from, aghlabid, times, abu, l, yusr, al, baghdadi, but, after, his, death, in, january, 911, he, was, replaced, by, abu, ja, far, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, al, baghdadi, who, would, continue, serving, in, this, capacity, under, al, mahdi, s, successors, after, the, purge, of, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, the, caliph, also, instituted, a, new, department, the, bureau, of, detection, diwan, al, kashf, under, the, supervision, of, the, katib, muhammad, al, baghdadi, unlike, contemporary, abbasid, practice, which, relegated, this, task, to, a, dedicated, department, al, mahdi, was, careful, to, hear, and, judge, petitions, for, redress, against, abuse, by, officials, mazalim, in, person, in, another, notable, department, from, usual, practice, there, was, no, department, for, the, army, as, the, tribally, organized, kutama, represented, the, bulk, of, the, fatimid, military, to, complement, them, al, mahdi, also, took, over, the, surviving, aghlabid, slave, soldiers, abid, usually, of, slavic, saqaliba, or, greek, rum, origin, as, well, as, recruiting, black, africans, the, arabic, settler, army, jund, of, kairouan, was, also, retained, albeit, relegated, to, secondary, status, due, to, their, dubious, loyalty, the, first, serious, challenge, to, the, new, regime, arose, within, the, ranks, of, the, very, men, who, had, brought, it, to, power, the, kutama, chieftains, the, prophetic, traditions, about, the, mahdi, while, diffuse, had, insisted, that, his, coming, would, be, heralded, by, celestial, signs, and, portents, that, he, would, be, a, young, man, of, exceptional, beauty, and, that, he, would, rapidly, and, miraculously, lead, his, armies, to, victory, not, only, did, al, mahdi, a, 35, year, old, former, merchant, accustomed, to, an, easy, life, wine, and, rich, clothing, not, match, these, expectations, but, his, luxurious, lifestyle, clashed, with, the, austere, doctrines, propagated, by, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, and, hitherto, followed, by, the, kutama, even, abu, abdallah, criticized, his, master, accusing, him, of, corrupting, the, kutama, with, power, money, and, luxury, and, gifts, at, the, same, time, while, al, mahdi, reaped, the, fruits, of, their, sacrifices, the, kutama, chieftains, saw, themselves, excluded, from, the, administration, which, was, staffed, with, non, kutama, officials, and, even, with, high, ranking, members, of, the, aghlabid, government, that, they, had, fought, against, as, a, result, abu, abdallah, became, disillusioned, with, his, master, as, historian, najam, haider, writes, this, was, a, failure, of, expectations, as, al, mahdi, did, not, live, up, to, vision, of, a, divinely, appointed, and, inerrant, figure, an, immediate, conflict, was, averted, as, abu, abdallah, was, called, to, lead, an, army, west, in, july, 910, during, the, previous, months, sijilmasa, had, been, lost, to, the, midrarids, tahert, was, once, more, closely, besieged, by, the, zenata, and, an, uprising, broke, out, among, the, kutama, led, by, a, certain, baban, the, latter, was, quickly, subdued, by, loyalist, kutama, and, abu, abdallah, managed, to, defeat, the, zenata, near, tubna, relieving, tahert, and, even, reaching, the, mediterranean, coast, at, t, n, s, he, then, campaigned, against, the, zenata, and, sadina, tribes, in, modern, central, algeria, before, returning, to, raqqada, in, the, winter, of, 910, 11, at, t, n, s, however, a, conspiracy, had, begun, among, the, kutama, chieftains, led, by, abu, abdallah, they, decided, to, confront, the, caliph, and, put, his, claims, to, the, test, the, sources, differ, on, the, details, but, the, kutama, confronted, al, mahdi, in, a, public, audience, demanding, that, he, perform, a, miracle, abu, abdallah, his, brother, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, abu, zaki, and, the, supreme, shaykh, abu, musa, harun, openly, accused, him, of, being, a, fraud, and, an, impostor, when, abu, musa, harun, was, murdered, shortly, after, the, other, conspirators, decided, to, assassinate, al, mahdi, possibly, due, to, the, doubts, of, abu, abdallah, or, because, they, could, not, agree, on, his, successor, they, delayed, their, action, informed, of, their, intentions, al, mahdi, moved, first, commanders, whose, loyalty, was, suspect, were, sent, to, missions, away, from, the, capital, and, replaced, by, loyal, ones, so, that, on, 18, february, 911, abu, abdallah, and, abu, l, abbas, muhammad, were, assassinated, by, loyal, kutama, soldiers, in, the, caliph, s, own, palace, news, of, the, death, of, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, spread, quickly, al, mahdi, hesitated, for, two, days, but, then, executed, the, remaining, kutama, leaders, involved, in, the, conspiracy, according, to, brett, who, rejects, or, doubts, the, early, association, of, abu, abdallah, with, a, central, movement, based, at, salamiya, al, mahdi, s, triumph, in, the, contest, with, abu, abdallah, meant, the, takeover, of, an, apocalyptic, movement, on, behalf, of, a, messiah, in, waiting, which, had, germinated, at, some, time, after, the, and, flourished, on, the, periphery, of, the, abbasid, empire, brett, further, suggests, that, the, events, of, 911, with, the, questions, raised, about, al, mahdi, s, identity, and, the, murder, of, abu, abdallah, are, the, origins, for, the, story, of, the, schism, of, 899, and, the, death, of, the, missionary, abdan, via, a, garbled, transmission, in, later, anti, fatimid, sources, the, new, regime, also, had, to, contend, with, the, more, extremist, tendencies, among, its, own, followers, early, isma, ili, doctrine, preached, that, all, previous, revealed, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, itself, and, their, scriptures, were, but, veils, they, imposed, outer, zahir, forms, and, rules, that, were, meant, to, conceal, the, inner, batin, true, religion, as, it, had, been, practised, in, paradise, the, coming, of, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, as, the, mahdi, in, the, end, times, would, reveal, these, esoteric, truths, haqa, iq, and, release, mankind, from, the, obligations, of, religious, law, shari, a, al, mahdi, s, modification, of, isma, ili, doctrine, to, allow, for, an, indefinite, number, of, imams, before, the, final, arrival, of, the, end, times, changed, these, expectations, but, they, continued, to, be, widely, held, notably, by, the, qarmatians, and, other, extremist, ghulat, groups, as, daftary, points, out, these, doctrines, and, acts, like, the, qarmatian, sack, of, mecca, in, 930, were, also, seized, upon, by, sunni, polemicists, to, accuse, all, isma, ilis, of, libertinism, and, antinomianism, as, late, as, 921, al, mahdi, had, to, take, measures, against, about, two, hundred, of, his, own, isma, ili, followers, who, openly, flouted, islamic, law, by, eating, pork, and, drinking, wine, in, the, month, of, ramadan, the, arrested, among, them, several, prominent, men, from, different, cities, regarded, the, previous, obligations, restrictions, imposed, by, religious, law, as, lifted, and, some, of, them, even, went, as, far, as, to, regard, al, mahdi, as, god, manifest, on, earth, this, was, anathema, to, al, mahdi, and, his, nascent, regime, as, halm, explains, antinomianism, meant, anarchy, and, so, long, as, the, kingdom, of, god, had, not, dawned, and, according, to, the, revised, doctrine, it, had, not, yet, dawned, the, beneficent, reins, of, the, law, could, not, be, dispensed, with, official, fatimid, doctrine, henceforth, insisted, on, the, continued, validity, of, the, shari, a, and, the, outer, strictures, of, islamic, law, even, for, those, isma, ili, faithful, who, had, been, be, initiated, into, the, inner, truths, but, the, latent, antinomian, tendencies, of, isma, ilism, would, re, emerge, in, the, future, in, movements, such, as, the, druze, and, the, order, of, assassins, during, the, 9th, century, kairouan, had, become, one, of, the, greatest, centres, of, islamic, jurisprudence, its, sunni, jurists, adopted, a, critical, stance, against, the, aghlabid, emirs, and, ambitious, chief, qadi, s, played, an, important, and, at, times, autonomous, political, role, dominated, by, the, conservative, maliki, school, since, the, mid, 9th, century, the, city, s, jurists, were, from, the, beginning, a, major, source, of, opposition, to, the, new, fatimid, regime, and, its, practices, abu, abdallah, and, his, brother, had, held, disputations, with, the, jurists, trying, to, win, them, over, to, backing, the, fatimids, claims, of, the, primacy, of, ali, and, his, progeny, or, the, tenets, of, isma, ili, doctrine, but, in, vain, during, the, campaign, of, abu, abdallah, to, sijilmasa, the, people, of, kairouan, apparently, hoped, that, he, would, never, return, in, october, november, two, prominent, jurists, were, publicly, executed, and, their, corpses, drawn, through, the, city, as, a, warning, the, letters, sent, by, abu, abdallah, first, from, sijilmasa, and, then, from, ikjan, about, the, success, of, his, mission, and, the, imminent, arrival, of, the, imam, our, lord, and, master, the, mahdi, and, his, son, were, read, publicly, in, kairouan, and, sent, to, all, cities, of, the, realm, to, discourage, opposition, al, mahdi, also, tried, to, reconcile, the, malikis, at, least, at, first, but, also, did, not, hesitate, to, impose, isma, ili, ritual, practices, against, their, vehement, objection, leading, to, constant, tensions, between, the, citizens, of, kairouan, and, the, fatimid, governors, of, the, city, who, were, responsible, for, their, implementation, for, the, duration, of, the, fatimids, rule, in, ifriqiya, the, maliki, elites, rejected, fatimid, legitimacy, maliki, authors, call, them, merely, easterners, or, even, unbelievers, and, the, caliphs, by, their, first, names, rather, than, their, regnal, titles, al, mahdi, himself, was, derisively, called, by, the, diminutive, form, of, his, first, name, as, ubayd, allah, little, abd, allah, whence, the, dynasty, is, usually, labelled, in, hostile, sunni, sources, as, ubaydid, ban, ubayd, consequently, al, mahdi, sought, and, found, support, among, the, malikis, rivals, the, minority, hanafi, school, especially, as, many, of, them, claimed, to, have, shi, a, sympathies, men, like, the, first, fatimid, chief, qadi, al, marwarrudhi, and, the, scholar, and, later, isma, ili, da, i, ibn, al, haytham, belonged, to, this, group, in, contrast, to, kairouan, the, court, in, the, palace, city, of, raqqada, was, dominated, by, isma, ilis, it, had, its, own, isma, ili, kutama, qadi, and, al, mahdi, s, companions, from, the, time, of, his, flight, served, as, its, chamberlains, the, chief, qadi, al, marwarrudhi, was, a, particular, object, of, hatred, by, the, maliki, kairouanis, due, to, his, uncompromising, stance, in, persecuting, any, deviation, from, isma, ili, precepts, in, the, end, the, many, death, sentences, became, too, much, even, for, al, mahdi, who, had, him, executed, in, 915, his, replacement, muhammad, ibn, mahfuz, al, qamudi, was, another, ifriqiyan, who, lasted, in, office, until, his, death, in, 919, his, successor, was, ishaq, ibn, abi, l, minhal, but, he, proved, too, moderate, for, al, mahdi, and, was, replaced, in, october, 923, by, a, more, determined, and, fanatical, isma, ili, partisan, muhammad, ibn, imran, al, nafti, as, al, nafti, died, within, a, few, months, of, taking, office, ibn, abi, l, minhal, was, restored, to, the, post, another, figure, accused, of, tyranny, was, the, governor, of, kairouan, abu, sa, id, al, dayf, appointed, in, 918, the, kairouanis, turned, to, the, heir, apparent, al, qa, im, for, assistance, in, mediating, an, audience, with, al, mahdi, to, air, their, grievances, isolated, instances, show, that, the, caliph, s, spy, network, complemented, and, extended, by, the, isma, ili, da, wa, to, far, beyond, the, borders, of, his, realm, was, active, in, identifying, and, eliminating, figures, who, actively, opposed, the, fatimid, regime, on, the, other, hand, according, to, halm, the, tales, in, maliki, sources, of, thousands, of, martyrs, perishing, in, the, dungeons, of, the, caliphal, palace, are, very, likely, a, gross, exaggeration, al, mahdi, was, willing, to, tolerate, dissent, as, long, as, it, did, not, break, out, into, public, opposition, in, summer, 911, a, quarrel, between, a, kutama, soldier, and, a, merchant, in, the, old, aghlabid, palace, city, of, al, qasr, al, qadim, led, to, an, uprising, in, the, latter, the, revolt, led, by, men, associated, with, the, previous, regime, subsided, after, a, few, clashes, with, the, kutama, but, after, enough, time, had, passed, al, mahdi, launched, purges, of, the, uprising, s, leaders, which, encompassed, his, minister, ibn, al, qadim, this, was, but, the, first, of, many, uprisings, against, the, kutama, however, who, quickly, became, hated, in, tahert, a, revolt, broke, out, that, killed, or, drove, out, the, kutama, garrison, and, then, called, the, zenata, under, ibn, khazar, for, aid, a, kutama, army, defeated, the, zenata, with, heavy, losses, and, sacked, tahert, on, 1, october, its, former, governor, dawwas, ibn, sawlat, al, lahisi, was, recalled, to, raqqada, and, executed, in, april, 912, another, quarrel, between, the, kutama, and, a, local, merchant, led, to, bloody, clashes, in, the, streets, of, kairouan, in, which, all, kutama, in, the, city, were, killed, the, sources, report, 700, dead, when, al, mahdi, tried, to, discover, the, leaders, of, this, affair, to, punish, them, he, was, met, with, silence, and, had, to, content, himself, with, a, delegation, of, city, notables, seeking, his, pardon, this, incident, rankled, with, the, kutama, and, coupled, with, the, previous, doubts, about, al, mahdi, helped, spark, a, new, uprising, a, young, boy, kadu, ibn, mu, arik, al, mawati, was, proclaimed, as, the, true, mahdi, new, da, i, s, were, appointed, and, a, new, holy, book, written, starting, from, ikjan, the, original, centre, of, abu, abdallah, s, mission, the, revolt, spread, to, the, cities, of, mila, and, constantine, while, a, loyalist, army, sent, against, them, was, thrown, back, after, many, of, the, kutama, in, its, ranks, defected, in, response, in, april, may, 912, al, mahdi, officially, proclaimed, his, son, abu, l, qasim, muhammad, as, heir, apparent, wali, al, ahd, gave, him, the, regnal, name, al, qa, im, bi, amr, allah, he, who, executes, god, s, command, and, placed, him, in, nominal, charge, of, the, army, sent, to, quell, the, revolt, on, 21, june, 912, the, loyalist, army, decisively, defeated, the, rebels, near, mila, the, anti, mahdi, al, mawati, and, the, other, rebel, leaders, were, soon, captured, and, prominently, featured, in, al, qa, im, s, triumphal, entry, into, kairouan, in, autumn, the, anti, kutama, riots, in, kairouan, and, al, qasr, al, qadim, highlighted, the, vulnerability, of, the, palace, city, of, raqqada, which, was, poorly, fortified, already, in, 912, al, mahdi, began, seeking, a, new, and, more, defensible, site, for, his, residence, he, personally, travelled, the, coast, for, this, purpose, even, visiting, the, ruins, of, ancient, carthage, before, settling, on, the, small, peninsula, of, jumma, a, rocky, peninsula, of, about, 1, 4, kilometres, 0, 87, mi, length, and, only, 175, metres, 574, ft, wide, at, its, base, it, was, eminently, defensible, from, a, land, based, attack, and, included, an, ancient, punic, artificial, harbour, cut, into, the, rock, construction, began, on, 11, may, 916, with, a, massive, landward, wall, whose, single, gate, was, considered, an, engineering, masterpiece, the, trick, of, installing, the, doors, on, beds, of, glass, so, that, a, single, person, could, open, them, was, said, to, have, come, from, al, mahdi, himself, the, new, palace, city, was, fortified, on, the, seaward, side, as, well, and, included, a, great, congregational, mosque, the, only, fatimid, era, structure, to, survive, to, modern, times, two, palaces, one, for, the, caliph, and, one, for, his, heir, apparent, and, other, buildings, for, the, caliphal, court, and, administration, the, only, weakness, of, mahdiya, was, its, lack, of, natural, resources, especially, water, large, grain, stores, and, cisterns, were, built, for, rainwater, but, in, case, of, a, siege, the, city, would, have, to, be, supplied, by, sea, as, heavy, rainfall, damaged, the, palaces, in, raqqada, al, mahdi, expedited, the, move, into, the, new, residence, with, his, court, which, took, place, on, 20, february, 921, although, construction, was, still, ongoing, mahdiya, was, palace, city, arsenal, treasury, and, military, stronghold, in, one, only, the, fatimid, family, and, its, most, loyal, members, were, settled, there, the, garrison, was, provided, by, black, african, slave, troops, zawila, as, well, as, by, slavic, slave, soldiers, and, kutama, the, zawila, and, kutama, soldiers, lived, mostly, in, the, city, s, suburb, outside, the, landward, wall, the, arab, jund, and, its, leaders, whose, loyalties, were, suspect, was, deliberately, excluded, al, mahdi, died, at, mahdiya, on, 4, march, 934, after, a, period, of, illness, al, qa, im, kept, his, death, secret, for, a, hundred, days, before, announcing, a, period, of, public, mourning, as, the, designated, nass, successor, of, the, imam, caliph, al, qa, im, did, not, face, any, opposition, his, numerous, half, siblings, by, concubines, six, sons, and, seven, daughters, never, played, an, important, role, and, al, mahdi, had, deliberately, kept, them, in, the, palace, not, entrusting, them, with, a, gubernatorial, or, military, command, only, once, during, al, qa, im, s, 928, campaign, against, the, berbers, when, he, was, out, of, contact, with, mahdiya, for, several, weeks, and, feared, lost, did, al, mahdi, allow, another, son, abu, ali, ahmad, to, play, a, leading, role, in, public, ceremonies, the, motivation, for, this, unusual, move, whether, as, a, result, of, palace, intrigues, or, due, to, a, genuine, concern, that, al, qa, im, might, be, dead, and, whether, al, mahdi, truly, intended, to, promote, ahmad, as, an, alternative, successor, remains, unknown, al, qa, im, rushed, back, to, his, father, s, side, and, consolidated, his, position, but, the, affair, left, a, lasting, rift, between, al, mahdi, and, his, son, however, in, tripolitania, a, certain, muhammad, ibn, talut, claimed, to, be, a, son, of, al, mahdi, and, laid, claim, to, the, caliphate, he, managed, to, rally, a, large, following, among, the, local, berbers, before, his, deception, was, discovered, and, he, was, executed, by, his, own, followers, otherwise, the, transition, into, the, new, reign, was, smooth, with, al, qa, im, taking, up, residence, in, the, caliphal, palace, of, mahdiya, and, retaining, al, mahdi, s, ministers, in, their, duties, immediately, after, stabilizing, his, rule, over, the, former, aghlabid, domains, al, mahdi, was, virtually, obliged, to, engage, in, imperial, expansion, as, brett, puts, it, this, was, ultimately, the, goal, on, which, his, credibility, rested, the, conquest, of, the, world, to, east, and, west, this, meant, military, operations, in, three, directions, at, once, against, three, political, and, ideological, powers, that, dominated, the, mediterranean, world, the, muslim, usurpers, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, the, east, and, the, umayyad, emirate, of, c, rdoba, in, the, west, and, the, main, christian, enemy, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, north, in, sicily, and, southern, italy, following, the, consolidation, of, his, rule, in, ifriqiya, al, mahdi, s, first, objective, was, egypt, the, gateway, to, syria, and, iraq, the, old, heartlands, of, the, islamic, world, and, seat, of, their, abbasid, rivals, the, fatimids, hoped, for, help, from, their, sympathizers, in, egypt, not, only, had, al, mahdi, himself, stayed, at, fustat, in, 904, 905, but, the, sources, record, that, the, local, abbasid, governor, was, forced, to, execute, several, people, for, corresponding, with, al, mahdi, and, his, son, al, qa, im, the, first, step, east, was, tripoli, which, submitted, to, the, fatimids, following, the, fall, of, the, aghlabid, emirate, the, local, hawwara, berbers, quickly, came, to, resent, the, overbearing, behaviour, of, the, kutama, soldiery, as, well, as, the, heavy, tax, demands, placed, upon, them, a, first, uprising, and, siege, of, tripoli, in, 910, 911, was, followed, by, a, general, revolt, of, the, hawwara, in, summer, 912, the, fatimid, governor, of, tripoli, fled, and, all, kutama, in, the, city, were, slaughtered, al, qa, im, led, a, combined, land, and, naval, expedition, laying, siege, to, tripoli, until, it, capitulated, in, june, 913, al, qa, im, left, one, of, the, principal, kutama, generals, habasa, ibn, yusuf, there, to, prepare, the, further, eastward, expansion, of, the, fatimid, empire, al, mahdi, apparently, also, entertained, hopes, of, a, pincer, movement, against, egypt, from, two, sides, with, the, support, of, his, missionaries, in, the, yemen, it, was, not, to, be, ibn, al, fadl, who, had, conquered, most, of, yemen, from, his, base, in, the, south, of, the, country, renounced, al, mahdi, and, proclaimed, himself, as, the, mahdi, in, august, 911, the, reasons, for, this, are, unclear, but, are, likely, related, to, the, contemporary, processes, of, disillusionment, with, al, mahdi, in, ifriqiya, and, the, news, of, the, execution, of, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, al, mahdi, had, also, sent, a, letter, to, the, yemeni, faithful, addressing, concerns, as, to, his, identity, and, documenting, his, supposed, genealogy, this, letter, caused, much, unease, and, dissension, for, al, mahdi, effectively, repudiated, the, title, of, proof, of, god, and, the, notion, of, a, second, muhammad, which, had, been, associated, with, the, mahdi, until, then, and, in, whose, name, abu, abdallah, had, proclaimed, his, victory, in, the, same, letter, he, claimed, descent, from, ja, far, al, sadiq, the, last, common, imam, recognized, by, twelvers, and, isma, ilis, alike, via, al, sadiq, s, eldest, son, abdallah, al, aftah, whom, he, named, as, the, father, of, his, own, great, grandfather, abdallah, al, akbar, not, only, did, this, contradict, all, previous, isma, ili, propaganda, which, emphasized, that, the, legitimate, imamate, had, followed, the, line, of, al, sadiq, s, younger, son, isma, il, but, the, claimed, genealogy, was, patently, false, abdallah, al, aftah, died, young, and, was, commonly, known, to, not, have, had, any, offspring, the, same, letter, further, upended, previous, doctrine, by, emphasizing, that, though, he, was, the, expected, mahdi, his, rule, would, not, bring, about, the, end, times, but, merely, represent, another, link, in, a, line, of, imams, that, was, to, continue, endlessly, into, the, future, thereby, contradicting, all, millennialist, expectations, vested, in, his, person, the, other, isma, ili, da, i, in, the, yemen, ibn, hawshab, remained, loyal, to, al, mahdi, but, was, forced, to, capitulate, against, ibn, al, fadl, s, forces, and, hand, over, his, son, ja, far, as, a, hostage, both, da, i, s, died, within, a, few, months, of, each, other, in, 915, ibn, al, fadl, was, said, to, have, been, poisoned, by, agents, of, al, mahdi, posing, as, physicians, leading, to, the, swift, collapse, of, isma, ili, rule, in, the, yemen, by, 917, the, sunni, yu, firids, had, completed, the, reconquest, of, the, country, in, the, name, of, the, abbasid, caliph, the, first, expedition, against, egypt, was, launched, on, 24, january, 914, led, by, habasa, ibn, yusuf, advancing, along, the, coast, on, 6, february, it, entered, barqa, the, capital, of, cyrenaica, there, habasa, executed, two, chieftains, of, the, mazata, tribe, who, nine, years, before, had, waylaid, and, robbed, al, mahdi, during, his, journey, to, ifriqiya, their, sons, were, also, killed, and, their, womenfolk, sold, into, slavery, and, their, possessions, confiscated, encouraged, by, this, success, on, 11, july, al, mahdi, sent, al, qa, im, with, another, army, east, to, assume, command, of, the, expedition, disregarding, these, orders, however, the, ambitious, habasa, led, his, forces, into, egypt, entering, alexandria, on, 27, august, the, news, of, the, fatimid, invasion, threw, baghdad, into, a, panic, the, abbasid, government, had, paid, little, attention, to, the, affairs, of, ifriqiya, and, the, claims, of, al, mahdi, al, tabari, refers, to, him, vaguely, as, al, khariji, the, kharijite, or, ibn, al, basri, son, of, the, basran, but, now, urgent, inquiries, were, made, as, to, his, origin, and, intentions, the, fatimid, campaign, in, egypt, ultimately, failed, the, attempts, to, cross, the, nile, at, giza, and, capture, fustat, were, beaten, back, and, reinforcements, arrived, from, syria, under, mu, nis, al, muzaffar, in, april, 915, greatly, shoring, up, the, abbasid, position, in, the, country, the, fatimid, army, was, also, plagued, by, indiscipline, and, a, divided, command, as, al, qa, im, fell, out, with, habasa, the, latter, eventually, deserted, the, campaign, and, returned, to, ifriqiya, alarmed, by, this, al, qa, im, evacuated, alexandria, hastily, and, without, battle, leaving, much, of, his, armament, and, equipment, behind, returning, to, raqqada, in, 28, may, 915, in, his, rear, cyrenaica, rose, in, revolt, and, overthrew, fatimid, control, in, barqa, the, entire, kutama, garrison, was, killed, the, expedition, s, failure, rocked, the, fatimid, regime, s, very, foundation, and, the, belief, in, the, divine, mission, of, the, imam, caliph, was, shaken, as, a, result, discontent, arose, particularly, among, the, kutama, sub, tribe, of, the, malusa, from, whom, habasa, now, hounded, as, a, criminal, originated, his, eventual, capture, and, imprisonment, led, to, the, revolt, of, his, brother, ghazwiyya, who, had, played, a, crucial, role, in, securing, al, mahdi, s, regime, up, to, that, point, and, who, had, recently, been, given, charge, of, the, entire, kutama, country, to, the, west, of, ifriqiya, the, revolt, was, quickly, crushed, however, and, ghazwiyya, and, habasa, were, executed, when, their, heads, were, brought, before, al, mahdi, he, is, said, to, have, exclaimed, once, did, these, heads, enclose, the, east, and, west, and, now, they, are, contained, within, this, basket, al, mahdi, immediately, began, preparations, for, a, second, assault, on, egypt, starting, with, the, recapture, of, cyrenaica, this, was, accomplished, with, the, surrender, of, barqa, after, an, 18, month, siege, in, april, 917, the, expedition, against, egypt, began, on, 5, april, 919, when, al, qa, im, placed, in, sole, command, of, the, campaign, set, out, from, raqqada, although, alexandria, s, abbasid, garrison, had, been, reinforced, it, was, abandoned, without, battle, upon, the, arrival, of, the, fatimid, army, having, already, acknowledged, fatimid, sovereignty, during, the, first, invasion, and, hence, now, considered, in, revolt, the, city, was, sacked, by, the, fatimid, troops, once, again, the, abbasids, concentrated, at, defending, the, nile, crossing, at, giza, al, qa, im, did, not, move, against, giza, however, giving, time, for, abbasid, reinforcements, under, mu, nis, al, muzaffar, to, arrive, on, 12, march, 920, the, fatimid, invasion, fleet, was, destroyed, by, the, abbasid, admiral, thamal, al, dulafi, crippling, the, invaders, pressed, for, supplies, al, qa, im, repeated, his, manoeuvre, of, 914, occupying, the, fayyum, oasis, fatimid, troops, also, succeeded, in, occupying, much, of, upper, egypt, cutting, off, the, grain, supply, to, fustat, for, an, entire, year, after, that, both, sides, avoided, open, conflict, and, engaged, rather, in, a, diplomatic, and, propaganda, battle, mu, nis, offered, promises, of, safe, conduct, as, well, as, recognition, of, the, fatimids, as, autonomous, rulers, of, ifriqiya, in, the, style, of, the, aghlabids, if, al, qa, im, and, his, father, submitted, to, the, abbasid, caliph, al, qa, im, rejected, these, overtures, reiterating, the, fatimid, claims, to, universal, dominion, as, the, rightful, heirs, of, muhammad, he, also, sent, letters, to, fustat, urging, the, egyptians, to, rise, in, revolt, and, to, the, two, holy, cities, of, islam, mecca, and, medina, demanding, recognition, of, the, fatimid, claims, to, sovereignty, over, the, islamic, world, finally, in, late, spring, 921, the, abbasids, launched, their, attack, capturing, alexandria, and, then, moving, onto, fayyum, cut, off, in, the, oasis, al, qa, im, was, forced, to, abandon, all, his, heavy, equipment, and, with, his, army, crossed, the, desert, to, barqa, for, a, few, years, the, fatimids, continued, to, launch, raids, from, barqa, into, egypt, in, 922, 23, and, 928, fatimid, troops, fought, abbasid, troops, at, dhat, al, himam, some, 60, kilometres, 37, mi, west, of, alexandria, in, 923, 24, the, fatimid, commander, masrur, ibn, sulayman, ibn, kafi, raided, one, of, the, oases, of, the, western, desert, likely, dakhla, oasis, defeated, the, local, governor, and, occupied, the, place, before, the, outbreak, of, a, disease, forced, him, to, retreat, these, attacks, on, egypt, coincided, with, almost, a, decade, of, intensive, attacks, against, the, abbasids, by, the, qarmatians, of, bahrayn, under, the, leadership, of, abu, tahir, al, jannabi, but, contrary, to, the, claims, by, contemporary, arab, historians, and, the, hypotheses, put, forth, by, some, early, 20th, century, scholars, of, isma, ilism, no, coordination, between, al, jannabi, and, al, mahdi, can, be, established, when, the, qarmatians, sacked, mecca, in, 930, and, stole, the, black, stone, al, mahdi, even, sent, a, letter, to, abu, tahir, in, reproach, and, urged, him, to, immediately, return, of, the, black, stone, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, al, mahdi, may, have, begun, organizing, a, third, invasion, of, egypt, but, it, was, not, launched, until, after, his, death, in, 936, during, a, period, of, turmoil, in, the, province, like, the, previous, two, attempts, it, was, unsuccessful, it, was, beaten, back, by, muhammad, ibn, tughj, al, ikhshid, who, took, over, power, in, egypt, and, established, his, own, dynasty, there, it, was, not, until, 969, when, the, balance, of, power, had, shifted, much, more, decisively, in, favour, of, the, fatimids, and, the, ikhshidid, regime, had, declined, that, another, invasion, was, undertaken, leading, to, the, fatimid, conquest, of, egypt, the, core, territories, of, fatimid, ifriqiya, were, the, same, as, in, late, antique, times, when, the, area, had, been, the, byzantine, exarchate, of, africa, tunisia, northeastern, algeria, and, tripolitania, which, had, been, highly, urbanized, since, antiquity, and, were, used, to, regular, administration, and, taxation, outside, these, areas, the, native, berber, tribes, resisted, fiercely, any, attempts, to, impose, fatimid, rule, from, the, sedentary, farmers, of, the, nafusa, mountains, south, of, tripoli, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, aur, s, mountains, in, western, tunisia, and, eastern, algeria, known, to, arab, authors, as, the, refuge, of, all, rebels, to, the, nomadic, zenata, tribesmen, of, the, central, algerian, plateau, and, the, settled, farmers, of, ouarsenis, in, northwestern, algeria, the, mountainous, areas, generally, escaped, tight, fatimid, control, in, tripolitania, the, hawwara, berbers, were, subdued, as, part, of, the, consolidation, of, fatimid, rule, over, tripoli, and, their, western, neighbours, the, berbers, of, the, nafusa, mountains, were, conquered, in, a, series, of, campaigns, in, 922, 923, by, the, da, i, sulayman, ibn, kafi, al, ijjani, an, exception, was, tahert, which, served, as, a, westerly, outpost, of, fatimid, ifriqiya, located, some, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, from, the, eastern, edge, of, ifriqiya, proper, its, fatimid, governor, masala, ibn, habus, was, a, miknasa, berber, which, brought, his, tribe, under, the, fatimid, banner, the, efforts, of, the, miknasa, to, spread, isma, ilism, in, ouarsenis, on, the, other, hand, failed, miserably, as, the, missionaries, were, simply, killed, by, the, local, population, likewise, in, 922, the, kutama, commander, fahlun, and, his, men, trying, to, impose, fatimid, rule, in, the, aur, s, including, heavy, taxation, and, the, dispatch, of, hostages, to, mahdiya, were, overwhelmed, by, the, locals, and, killed, in, their, sleep, masala, faced, the, zenata, under, their, leader, ibn, khazar, who, repeatedly, tried, to, wrest, control, of, tahert, from, the, fatimids, masala, was, killed, by, his, rival, in, november, 924, and, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, yasal, although, the, latter, was, able, to, repel, a, zenata, attack, on, tahert, in, 925, the, defeat, of, a, fatimid, relief, army, by, ibn, khazar, encouraged, other, berber, tribes, in, the, area, to, rise, in, revolt, this, forced, al, mahdi, to, send, al, qa, im, to, deal, with, the, revolt, in, person, the, heir, apparent, set, out, in, april, 927, issuing, a, call, to, arms, not, only, for, the, kutama, tribes, but, also, the, arab, jund, and, the, subdued, berber, tribes, such, as, the, hawwara, and, ajisa, to, ensure, the, latter, s, loyalty, the, families, of, their, chiefs, were, sent, as, hostages, to, mahdiya, al, mahdi, s, old, slave, su, luk, now, known, as, the, chamberlain, ja, far, ibn, ubayd, subdued, the, kiyana, tribe, in, the, hodna, mountains, whereupon, al, qa, im, established, a, new, city, named, al, muhammadiya, modern, m, sila, after, himself, to, cement, fatimid, control, over, the, area, one, of, the, earliest, isma, ili, partisans, ali, ibn, hamdun, al, andalusi, was, made, its, first, governor, ziri, ibn, manad, the, leader, of, another, berber, tribe, the, sanhaja, also, offered, his, submission, to, al, qa, im, at, this, time, al, qa, im, then, entered, the, zenata, lands, in, the, zab, mountains, denying, them, food, and, pasture, and, launching, a, pursuit, of, ibn, khazar, conditions, were, hard, uninterrupted, rainfall, for, over, a, month, cut, off, communications, with, mahdiya, where, the, court, feared, that, the, entire, expedition, was, lost, although, ibn, khazar, managed, again, and, again, to, escape, his, hunters, in, march, 928, al, qa, im, sacked, the, zenata, capital, zabraqa, the, victorious, army, then, returned, to, tahert, and, thence, ifriqiya, being, given, a, triumphal, reception, at, mahdiya, in, november, 928, his, victory, dispatch, prompted, the, circulation, of, a, poem, where, the, al, qa, im, announces, himself, as, the, son, of, the, messenger, of, god, who, is, about, to, roam, throughout, god, s, earth, to, egypt, and, iraq, and, afterwards, i, shall, concern, myself, with, baghdad, despite, this, success, fatimid, rule, over, the, remote, areas, of, the, maghreb, was, fragile, even, in, tahert, the, local, population, felt, at, liberty, to, nominate, their, own, governor, masala, s, son, ali, when, yasal, died, in, 931, al, mahdi, had, to, send, a, military, expedition, to, the, city, to, install, his, preferred, candidate, yasal, s, son, hamid, apart, from, the, abbasids, al, mahdi, faced, a, major, muslim, rival, closer, to, ifriqiya, in, the, form, of, the, umayyads, of, c, rdoba, rulers, of, al, andalus, islamic, spain, however, the, confrontation, between, the, two, major, islamic, powers, of, the, western, mediterranean, took, place, mostly, via, propaganda, and, proxies, rather, than, direct, conflict, at, the, time, of, al, mahdi, s, accession, the, umayyad, emirate, was, plagued, by, internal, dissension, notably, the, uprising, of, ibn, hafsun, who, in, his, conflict, with, emir, abdallah, r, 888, 912, pledged, his, allegiance, to, al, mahdi, al, mahdi, sent, robes, of, honour, and, two, isma, ili, da, i, s, to, the, rebel, leader, in, whose, territories, the, friday, sermon, was, read, in, the, name, of, the, fatimid, caliph, al, mahdi, s, campaigns, in, the, western, maghreb, in, what, is, now, morocco, were, in, part, meant, to, spread, fear, on, the, threshold, of, the, iberian, peninsula, according, to, historian, farhat, dachraoui, but, the, restiveness, of, the, berber, tribes, limited, the, ability, of, the, fatimid, ruler, to, project, power, beyond, tahert, and, seriously, contemplate, an, invasion, of, al, andalus, nevertheless, the, fatimid, threat, was, taken, seriously, by, the, umayyad, emir, abd, al, rahman, iii, r, 912, 961, who, reinforced, his, fleet, and, established, patrols, along, his, southern, coasts, as, one, of, his, first, measures, upon, his, accession, during, the, first, two, decades, of, his, rule, abd, al, rahman, was, occupied, with, suppressing, revolts, most, notably, that, of, ibn, hafsun, but, as, his, power, grew, in, 927, an, umayyad, fleet, captured, melilla, establishing, it, as, a, military, base, in, the, moroccan, coast, followed, by, ceuta, in, 931, abd, al, rahman, also, entered, into, an, alliance, with, ibn, khazar, recognizing, him, as, the, paramount, emir, of, the, zenata, and, sending, him, frequent, gifts, in, exchange, for, the, berber, leader, s, recognizing, umayyad, suzerainty, finally, once, he, had, secured, his, own, position, in, al, andalus, in, 929, abd, al, rahman, iii, claimed, the, title, of, caliph, for, himself, establishing, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, in, a, direct, challenge, to, al, mahdi, s, pretensions, both, temporal, and, religious, in, june, 917, a, fatimid, expedition, under, masala, ibn, habus, sacked, the, coastal, town, of, nakur, modern, al, hoceima, the, seat, of, a, small, emirate, its, ruler, was, killed, but, his, sons, fled, to, malaga, on, the, spanish, coast, once, masala, withdrew, his, army, however, the, exiled, princes, of, nakur, returned, with, the, backing, of, emir, abd, al, rahman, iii, and, in, a, single, night, managed, to, overthrow, the, fatimid, garrison, of, the, town, in, exchange, nakur, s, new, emir, became, a, vassal, of, the, emir, of, c, rdoba, next, masala, moved, against, the, domains, of, the, idrisid, dynasty, an, alid, clan, that, ruled, over, what, is, now, northern, and, central, morocco, at, the, time, idrisid, rule, over, morocco, had, fractured, into, various, local, principalities, led, by, competing, lines, of, the, dynasty, that, were, fighting, each, other, as, well, as, local, rivals, masala, forced, the, idrisid, ruler, of, fes, yahya, iv, to, acknowledge, fatimid, suzerainty, and, pay, tribute, yahya, s, authority, was, limited, to, fes, and, its, environs, while, the, rest, of, the, country, was, given, to, the, governorship, of, masala, s, cousin, musa, ibn, abi, l, afiya, masala, returned, to, morocco, in, 921, forcing, the, emir, of, nakur, to, abandon, his, capital, without, a, fight, influenced, by, the, ambitious, musa, ibn, abi, l, afiya, masala, marched, on, fes, deposed, yahya, iv, and, installed, a, fatimid, governor, in, the, city, on, the, return, march, masala, once, more, imposed, fatimid, rule, over, sijilmasa, installing, a, pliant, midrarid, as, a, fatimid, vassal, the, idrisids, response, to, the, appearance, of, the, fatimids, varied, prior, to, the, fatimid, invasion, the, idrisids, appear, to, have, been, aligned, with, the, umayyads, of, c, rdoba, some, idrisids, accepted, al, mahdi, s, claims, to, alid, descent, and, thus, tended, to, side, with, the, fatimids, while, others, resisted, fatimid, expansion, and, turned, to, the, umayyads, of, c, rdoba, for, support, one, of, the, latter, al, hasan, al, hajjam, rose, in, revolt, and, recovered, fes, his, rule, lasted, for, about, two, years, before, ibn, abi, l, afiya, retook, the, city, through, treachery, and, had, him, killed, ibn, abi, l, afiya, then, launched, a, widespread, manhunt, against, the, remaining, idrisids, across, morocco, which, ended, only, after, local, chieftains, warned, him, of, the, inappropriateness, of, hunting, down, descendants, of, muhammad, it, is, likely, that, at, this, point, according, to, the, historian, chafik, benchekroun, ibn, abi, l, afiya, was, acting, as, an, independent, agent, without, being, really, neither, pro, fatimid, nor, pro, umayyad, in, 929, 30, ibn, abi, l, afiya, brutally, sacked, nakur, and, extended, his, rule, over, the, coast, around, the, mouth, of, the, moulouya, river, another, expedition, against, ibn, khazar, failed, to, capture, the, zenata, chieftain, then, in, 931, 2, ibn, abi, l, afiya, defected, to, abd, al, rahman, iii, as, halm, writes, with, this, fatimid, rule, over, the, far, west, collapsed, with, one, blow, and, the, territories, held, by, ibn, abi, l, afiya, and, ibn, khazar, became, an, umayyad, protectorate, the, governor, of, tahert, hamid, ibn, yasal, was, immediately, sent, west, to, restore, fatimid, control, he, managed, to, defeat, ibn, abi, l, afiya, and, reoccupy, fes, but, this, was, ephemeral, shortly, after, the, fatimid, troops, left, the, city, it, was, lost, again, and, hamid, was, imprisoned, at, mahdiya, for, his, failure, ibn, abi, l, afiya, returned, to, umayyad, allegiance, but, was, soon, after, killed, by, the, idrisids, along, with, ifriqiya, al, mahdi, inherited, the, island, of, sicily, from, the, aghlabids, which, had, gradually, been, conquered, from, the, byzantine, empire, during, the, previous, decades, some, byzantine, strongholds, remained, in, the, mountainous, northeast, of, the, island, the, val, demone, as, well, as, a, byzantine, province, across, the, strait, of, messina, in, calabria, sicily, was, the, centre, of, a, perennial, war, with, the, byzantines, which, was, important, from, an, ideological, and, propaganda, perspective, allowing, the, fatimids, to, appear, as, champions, of, the, jihad, against, the, old, christian, enemy, of, the, muslim, world, as, the, historian, yaacov, lev, puts, it, at, the, same, time, lev, stresses, that, the, fatimids, were, interested, more, in, raiding, than, outright, conquest, that, for, the, byzantines, this, was, a, secondary, front, that, the, fleets, involved, were, small, and, that, periods, of, hostility, frequently, alternated, with, truces, and, a, practical, policy, of, modus, vivendi, in, august, 910, al, mahdi, sent, his, governor, of, kairouan, al, hasan, ibn, ahmad, ibn, abi, khinzir, as, the, first, fatimid, governor, to, sicily, soon, he, had, made, himself, so, unpopular, with, the, sicilians, apparently, due, to, heavy, taxation, shi, a, jurisprudence, entailed, a, 20, income, tax, known, as, the, fifth, khums, that, they, rose, in, revolt, imprisoned, him, and, asked, for, his, replacement, his, replacement, the, elderly, ali, ibn, umar, al, balawi, arrived, in, august, 912, but, he, too, was, deposed, in, early, 913, and, the, island, rose, in, revolt, under, the, aghlabid, ahmad, ibn, ziyadat, allah, ibn, qurhub, who, renounced, fatimid, allegiance, and, received, recognition, from, the, abbasid, caliph, in, july, 914, the, sicilian, fleet, commanded, by, ibn, qurhub, s, younger, son, muhammad, raided, the, coasts, of, ifriqiya, at, leptis, minor, the, sicilians, caught, a, fatimid, naval, squadron, by, surprise, on, 18, july, the, fatimid, fleet, was, torched, and, 600, prisoners, taken, among, the, latter, was, the, former, governor, of, sicily, ibn, abi, khinzir, who, was, executed, the, sicilians, defeated, a, fatimid, army, detachment, sent, to, repel, them, and, proceeded, south, sacking, sfax, and, reaching, tripoli, in, august, 914, only, the, presence, of, al, qa, im, who, was, then, on, his, way, to, invade, egypt, deterred, an, attack, on, the, city, in, the, next, year, however, a, similar, undertaking, failed, with, the, sicilian, fleet, being, defeated, some, areas, such, as, agrigento, defected, back, to, the, fatimids, ibn, qurhub, tried, to, flee, to, al, andalus, but, was, captured, and, delivered, to, al, mahdi, along, with, his, supporters, he, was, brought, to, raqqada, lashed, on, the, tomb, of, ibn, abi, khinzir, mutilated, and, publicly, crucified, the, island, s, capital, palermo, resisted, until, march, 917, after, its, capitulation, a, kutama, garrison, was, installed, under, the, governor, salim, ibn, asad, ibn, abi, rashid, the, stronger, fatimid, presence, allowed, salim, to, secure, relative, tranquility, for, the, island, over, twenty, years, remaining, in, office, until, another, revolt, overthrew, him, in, 937, in, august, 918, salim, led, a, night, attack, on, reggio, calabria, which, was, captured, and, sacked, in, the, following, year, however, a, truce, was, signed, with, taormina, and, the, other, byzantine, strongholds, of, the, val, demone, possibly, so, that, the, muslim, forces, could, be, concentrated, on, the, italian, mainland, there, an, expedition, of, 20, ships, under, mas, ud, al, fati, attacked, the, fortress, of, st, agatha, near, reggio, in, 922, 3, in, april, 924, a, major, fleet, was, sent, to, sicily, commanded, by, the, chamberlain, ja, far, ibn, ubayd, after, wintering, on, the, island, he, raided, bruzzano, near, reggio, before, sailing, on, to, sack, oria, in, apulia, over, 11, 000, prisoners, were, taken, and, the, local, byzantine, commander, and, bishop, surrendered, as, hostages, in, surety, for, the, payment, of, tribute, the, chamberlain, returned, in, triumph, to, mahdiya, in, september, 925, at, about, the, same, time, al, mahdi, made, contact, with, the, bulgarian, emperor, simeon, i, who, sent, envoys, to, propose, a, joint, attack, on, the, byzantine, capital, constantinople, the, bulgarian, ruler, suggested, that, the, bulgarians, would, invade, by, land, and, the, fatimids, come, by, sea, all, spoils, would, be, divided, equally, with, the, bulgarians, keeping, constantinople, and, the, fatimids, gaining, the, byzantine, territories, in, sicily, and, southern, italy, as, a, result, of, a, long, war, with, the, byzantines, by, 922, the, bulgarians, controlled, almost, the, whole, balkan, peninsula, but, constantinople, remained, out, of, simeon, s, reach, because, he, lacked, a, navy, according, to, the, byzantine, source, that, reports, on, these, negotiations, al, mahdi, accepted, the, proposal, but, the, ship, carrying, the, bulgarian, and, fatimid, envoys, to, simeon, was, captured, by, the, byzantines, near, the, calabrian, coast, when, the, byzantine, emperor, romanos, i, learned, about, the, negotiations, the, bulgarians, were, imprisoned, while, the, arab, envoys, were, allowed, to, return, to, mahdiya, with, rich, gifts, for, the, caliph, the, byzantines, hastened, to, renew, the, 917, peace, agreement, including, the, payment, of, tribute, and, simeon, s, death, in, 927, put, an, end, to, his, ambitions, warfare, with, the, byzantines, resumed, in, 928, when, a, fleet, was, sent, to, sicily, led, by, the, governor, of, kairouan, sabir, al, fata, he, attacked, a, locality, named, al, ghiran, the, caves, in, apulia, and, proceeded, to, sack, the, cities, of, taranto, and, otranto, the, outbreak, of, a, disease, forced, them, to, return, to, sicily, but, then, sabir, led, his, fleet, up, the, tyrrhenian, sea, forcing, salerno, and, naples, to, ransom, themselves, with, money, and, precious, brocades, in, 929, he, defeated, the, local, byzantine, strategos, on, the, adriatic, coast, and, sacked, termoli, he, returned, to, mahdiya, on, 5, september, 930, bringing, 18, 000, prisoners, with, him, encouraged, by, these, successes, al, mahdi, planned, a, new, and, larger, naval, offensive, against, the, byzantines, in, italy, but, the, arrival, of, a, byzantine, embassy, led, to, the, conclusion, of, another, truce, in, 931, 2, which, was, adhered, to, until, after, the, caliph, s, death, the, truth, of, the, descent, and, legitimacy, of, al, mahdi, s, claims, has, been, a, subject, of, intense, debate, since, his, appearance, on, the, world, stage, in, the, early, 900s, and, eludes, a, definite, answer, medieval, as, well, as, modern, scholars, have, pointed, out, the, problems, in, the, claims, put, forth, by, al, mahdi, or, on, his, behalf, by, later, isma, ili, writers, but, his, achievement, is, undeniable, as, the, orientalist, marius, canard, summarized, whoever, ubayd, allah, sa, d, may, have, been, he, laid, the, foundations, of, the, dynasty, in, north, africa, dachraoui, attributes, to, al, mahdi, tenacity, and, prudent, wisdom, and, stresses, that, no, matter, whether, al, mahdi, s, claims, of, alid, descent, and, possession, of, the, imamate, were, genuine, he, was, able, to, successfully, establish, a, new, state, end, the, concealment, of, the, isma, ili, da, wa, and, conduct, moderate, but, firm, policies, within, his, provinces, and, to, wage, tireless, warfare, beyond, his, frontiers, brett, points, out, that, al, mahdi, s, emphasis, on, constructing, a, state, and, dealing, with, the, realities, of, its, governance, left, him, little, time, to, adapt, the, isma, ili, doctrine, to, the, new, situation, and, develop, this, caliphate, of, god, into, a, full, blown, creed, of, the, imamate, this, was, not, achieved, until, the, reign, of, the, fourth, fatimid, imam, caliph, al, mu, izz, r, 953, 975, it, was, also, left, to, al, mu, izz, to, try, and, woo, over, the, qarmatians, the, seveners, who, after, the, schism, of, 899, still, expected, the, messianic, return, of, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, in, this, the, caliph, would, have, some, success, as, the, iranian, communities, returned, to, the, fatimid, allegiance, enriching, the, official, isma, ili, doctrine, with, their, intellectual, vigor, the, qarmatians, of, bahrayn, however, refused, to, accept, the, fatimids, as, legitimate, imams, in, a, letter, sent, to, the, isma, ili, community, in, yemen, by, al, mahdi, billah, which, was, recorded, by, ja, far, ibn, mansur, al, yaman, the, following, genealogy, is, given
