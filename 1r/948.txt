a, theology, professor, at, the, university, of, oxford, wycliffe, is, traditionally, believed, to, have, advocated, or, made, a, vernacular, translation, of, the, vulgate, bible, into, middle, english, though, more, recent, scholarship, has, minimalized, the, extent, of, his, advocacy, or, involvement, for, lack, of, direct, contemporary, evidence, 7, 8, he, became, an, influential, dissident, within, the, catholic, priesthood, during, the, 14th, century, and, is, often, considered, an, important, predecessor, to, protestantism, his, theory, of, dominion, meant, that, men, in, mortal, sin, were, not, entitled, to, exercise, authority, in, the, church, or, state, nor, to, own, property, wycliffe, insisted, on, the, radical, poverty, of, all, clergy, wycliffe, has, been, characterised, as, the, evening, star, of, scholasticism, and, as, the, morning, star, or, stella, matutina, of, the, english, reformation, certain, of, wycliffe, s, later, followers, derogatorily, called, lollards, by, their, orthodox, contemporaries, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, adopted, a, number, of, the, beliefs, attributed, to, wycliffe, such, as, theological, virtues, predestination, iconoclasm, and, the, notion, of, caesaropapism, with, some, questioning, the, veneration, of, saints, the, sacraments, requiem, masses, transubstantiation, monasticism, and, the, legitimacy, or, role, of, the, papacy, wycliffe, s, writings, in, latin, greatly, influenced, the, philosophy, and, teaching, of, the, czech, reformer, jan, hus, c, 1369, 1415, wycliffe, was, born, in, the, village, of, hipswell, near, richmond, in, the, north, riding, of, yorkshire, england, around, the, 1320s, he, has, conventionally, been, given, a, birth, date, of, 1324, but, hudson, and, kenny, state, only, records, suggest, he, was, born, in, the, mid, 1320s, conti, states, that, he, was, born, before, 1331, wycliffe, received, his, early, education, close, to, his, home, it, is, unknown, when, he, first, came, to, oxford, with, which, he, was, so, closely, connected, until, the, end, of, his, life, but, he, is, known, to, have, been, at, oxford, around, 1345, thomas, bradwardine, was, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, his, book, on, the, cause, of, god, against, the, pelagians, a, bold, recovery, of, the, pauline, augustinian, doctrine, of, grace, would, greatly, shape, young, wycliffe, s, views, as, did, the, black, death, which, reached, england, in, the, summer, of, 1348, from, his, frequent, references, to, it, in, later, life, it, appears, to, have, made, a, deep, and, abiding, impression, upon, him, according, to, robert, vaughn, the, effect, was, to, give, wycliffe, very, gloomy, views, in, regard, to, the, condition, and, prospects, of, the, human, race, in, september, of, 1351, wycliffe, became, a, priest, wycliffe, would, have, been, at, oxford, during, the, st, scholastica, day, riot, in, which, sixty, three, students, and, a, number, of, townspeople, were, killed, wycliffe, completed, his, bachelor, of, arts, degree, at, merton, college, as, a, junior, fellow, in, 1356, that, same, year, he, produced, a, small, treatise, the, last, age, of, the, church, in, the, light, of, the, virulence, of, the, plague, which, had, subsided, seven, years, previously, wycliffe, s, studies, led, him, to, the, opinion, that, the, close, of, the, 14th, century, would, mark, the, end, of, the, world, while, other, writers, viewed, the, plague, as, god, s, judgment, on, sinful, people, wycliffe, saw, it, as, an, indictment, of, an, unworthy, clergy, the, mortality, rate, among, the, clergy, had, been, particularly, high, and, those, who, replaced, them, were, in, his, opinion, uneducated, or, generally, disreputable, he, was, master, of, balliol, college, in, 1361, in, the, same, year, he, was, presented, by, the, college, to, the, parish, of, fillingham, in, lincolnshire, which, he, visited, rarely, during, long, vacations, from, oxford, for, this, he, had, to, give, up, the, headship, of, balliol, college, though, he, could, continue, to, live, at, oxford, he, is, said, to, have, had, rooms, in, the, buildings, of, the, queen, s, college, in, 1362, he, was, granted, a, prebend, at, aust, in, westbury, on, trym, which, he, held, in, addition, to, the, post, at, fillingham, his, performance, led, simon, islip, archbishop, of, canterbury, to, place, him, in, 1365, at, the, head, of, canterbury, hall, where, twelve, young, men, were, preparing, for, the, priesthood, in, december, 1365, islip, appointed, wycliffe, as, warden, but, when, islip, died, the, following, year, his, successor, simon, langham, a, man, of, monastic, training, turned, the, leadership, of, the, college, over, to, a, monk, in, 1367, wycliffe, appealed, to, rome, in, 1371, wycliffe, s, appeal, was, decided, and, the, outcome, was, unfavourable, to, him, the, incident, was, typical, of, the, ongoing, rivalry, between, monks, and, secular, clergy, at, oxford, at, this, time, in, 1368, he, gave, up, his, living, at, fillingham, and, took, over, the, rectory, of, ludgershall, buckinghamshire, not, far, from, oxford, which, enabled, him, to, retain, his, connection, with, the, university, tradition, has, it, that, he, commenced, his, translation, of, the, bible, into, english, whilst, sitting, in, a, room, above, what, is, now, the, porch, in, ludgershall, church, in, 1369, wycliffe, obtained, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, theology, and, his, doctorate, in, 1372, in, 1374, he, received, the, crown, living, of, st, mary, s, church, lutterworth, in, leicestershire, which, he, retained, until, his, death, in, 1374, his, name, appears, second, after, a, bishop, on, a, commission, which, the, english, government, sent, to, bruges, to, discuss, with, the, representatives, of, gregory, xi, a, number, of, points, in, dispute, between, the, king, and, the, pope, he, was, no, longer, satisfied, with, his, chair, as, the, means, of, propagating, his, ideas, and, soon, after, his, return, from, bruges, he, began, to, express, them, in, tracts, and, longer, works, in, a, book, concerned, with, the, government, of, god, and, the, ten, commandments, he, attacked, the, temporal, rule, of, the, clergy, the, collection, of, annates, indulgences, and, simony, according, to, dominican, historian, francis, aidan, gasquet, at, least, some, of, wycliffe, s, program, should, be, seen, as, naive, attempts, at, social, reconstruction, in, the, aftermath, the, continuing, institutional, chaos, after, the, black, death, 1347, 1349, he, entered, the, politics, of, the, day, with, his, great, work, de, civili, dominio, on, civil, dominion, which, drew, arguments, from, the, works, of, richard, fitzralph, s, this, called, for, the, royal, divestment, of, all, church, property, his, ideas, on, lordship, and, church, wealth, caused, his, first, official, condemnation, in, 1377, by, pope, gregory, xi, who, censured, 19, articles, wycliffe, argued, that, the, church, had, fallen, into, sin, and, that, it, ought, therefore, to, give, up, all, its, property, and, that, the, clergy, should, live, in, complete, poverty, the, tendency, of, the, high, offices, of, state, to, be, held, by, clerics, was, resented, by, many, of, the, nobles, such, as, the, backroom, power, broker, john, of, gaunt, who, would, have, had, his, own, reasons, for, opposing, the, wealth, and, power, of, the, clergy, since, it, challenged, the, foundation, of, his, power, wycliffe, was, summoned, before, william, courtenay, bishop, of, london, on, 19, february, 1377, the, exact, charges, are, not, known, as, the, matter, did, not, get, as, far, as, a, definite, examination, lechler, suggests, that, wycliffe, was, targeted, by, john, of, gaunt, s, opponents, among, the, nobles, and, church, hierarchy, gaunt, the, earl, marshal, henry, percy, and, a, number, of, other, supporters, accompanied, wycliffe, a, crowd, gathered, at, the, church, and, at, the, entrance, party, animosities, began, to, show, especially, in, an, angry, exchange, between, the, bishop, and, wycliffe, s, protectors, gaunt, declared, that, he, would, humble, the, pride, of, the, english, clergy, and, their, partisans, hinting, at, the, intent, to, secularise, the, possessions, of, the, church, the, assembly, broke, up, and, gaunt, and, his, partisans, departed, with, their, prot, g, most, of, the, english, clergy, were, irritated, by, this, encounter, and, attacks, upon, wycliffe, began, the, second, and, third, books, of, his, work, dealing, with, civil, government, carry, a, sharp, polemic, on, 22, may, 1377, pope, gregory, xi, sent, five, copies, of, a, bull, against, wycliffe, dispatching, one, to, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, the, others, to, the, bishop, of, london, king, edward, iii, the, chancellor, and, the, university, among, the, enclosures, were, 18, theses, of, his, which, were, denounced, as, erroneous, and, dangerous, to, church, and, state, stephen, lahey, suggests, that, gregory, s, action, against, wycliffe, was, an, attempt, to, put, pressure, on, king, edward, to, make, peace, with, france, edward, iii, died, on, 21, june, 1377, and, the, bull, against, wycliffe, did, not, reach, england, before, december, wycliffe, was, asked, to, give, the, king, s, council, his, opinion, on, whether, it, was, lawful, to, withhold, traditional, payments, to, rome, and, he, responded, that, it, was, back, at, oxford, the, vice, chancellor, confined, wycliffe, for, some, time, in, black, hall, but, his, friends, soon, obtained, his, release, in, march, 1378, he, was, summoned, to, appear, at, lambeth, palace, to, defend, himself, however, sir, lewis, clifford, entered, the, chapel, and, in, the, name, of, the, queen, mother, joan, of, kent, forbade, the, bishops, to, proceed, to, a, definite, sentence, concerning, wycliffe, s, conduct, or, opinions, wycliffe, wrote, a, letter, expressing, and, defending, his, less, obnoxious, doctrines, xlii, the, bishops, who, were, divided, satisfied, themselves, with, forbidding, him, to, speak, further, on, the, controversy, wycliffe, then, wrote, his, de, incarcerandis, fedelibus, with, 33, conclusions, in, latin, and, english, in, this, writing, he, laid, open, the, entire, case, in, such, a, way, that, it, was, understood, by, the, laity, in, it, he, demanded, that, it, should, be, legal, for, the, excommunicated, to, appeal, to, the, king, and, his, council, against, the, excommunication, ordinary, citizens, some, of, the, nobility, and, his, former, protector, john, of, gaunt, rallied, to, him, before, any, further, steps, could, be, taken, at, rome, gregory, xi, died, in, 1378, the, attacks, on, pope, gregory, xi, grew, ever, more, extreme, wycliffe, s, stand, concerning, the, ideal, of, poverty, became, continually, firmer, as, well, as, his, position, with, regard, to, the, temporal, rule, of, the, clergy, closely, related, to, this, attitude, was, his, book, de, officio, regis, the, content, of, which, was, foreshadowed, in, his, 33, conclusions, this, book, like, those, that, preceded, and, followed, was, concerned, with, the, reform, of, the, church, in, which, the, temporal, arm, was, to, have, an, influential, part, from, 1380, onwards, wycliffe, devoted, himself, to, writings, that, argued, his, rejection, of, transubstantiation, and, strongly, criticised, the, friars, who, supported, it, 281, in, the, summer, of, 1381, wycliffe, formulated, his, doctrine, of, the, lord, s, supper, in, twelve, short, sentences, and, made, it, a, duty, to, advocate, it, everywhere, then, the, english, hierarchy, proceeded, against, him, the, chancellor, of, the, university, of, oxford, had, some, of, the, declarations, pronounced, heretical, when, this, was, announced, to, wycliffe, he, declared, that, no, one, could, change, his, convictions, he, then, appealed, not, to, the, pope, nor, to, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, of, the, land, but, to, the, king, he, published, his, great, confession, upon, the, subject, and, also, a, second, writing, in, english, intended, for, the, common, people, as, long, as, wycliffe, limited, his, attacks, to, abuses, and, the, wealth, of, the, church, he, could, rely, on, the, support, of, part, of, the, clergy, and, aristocracy, but, once, he, dismissed, the, traditional, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, his, theses, could, not, be, defended, any, more, this, view, cost, him, the, support, of, john, of, gaunt, and, many, others, in, the, midst, of, this, came, the, peasants, revolt, of, 1381, the, revolt, was, sparked, in, part, by, wycliffe, s, preaching, carried, throughout, the, realm, by, poor, priests, appointed, by, wycliffe, mostly, laymen, the, preachers, didn, t, limit, their, criticism, of, the, accumulation, of, wealth, and, property, to, that, of, the, monasteries, but, rather, included, secular, properties, belonging, to, the, nobility, as, well, although, wycliffe, disapproved, of, the, revolt, some, of, his, disciples, justified, the, killing, of, simon, sudbury, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 1382, wycliffe, s, old, enemy, william, courtenay, now, archbishop, of, canterbury, called, an, ecclesiastical, assembly, of, notables, at, london, during, the, consultations, on, 21, may, an, earthquake, occurred, the, participants, were, terrified, and, wished, to, break, up, the, assembly, but, courtenay, declared, the, earthquake, a, favourable, sign, which, meant, the, purification, of, the, earth, from, erroneous, doctrine, and, the, result, of, the, earthquake, synod, was, assured, of, the, 24, propositions, attributed, to, wycliffe, without, mentioning, his, name, ten, were, declared, heretical, and, fourteen, erroneous, the, former, had, reference, to, the, transformation, in, the, sacrament, the, latter, to, matters, of, church, order, and, institutions, it, was, forbidden, from, that, time, to, hold, these, opinions, or, to, advance, them, in, sermons, or, in, academic, discussions, all, persons, disregarding, this, order, were, to, be, subject, to, prosecution, to, accomplish, this, the, help, of, the, state, was, necessary, but, the, commons, rejected, the, bill, the, king, however, had, a, decree, issued, which, permitted, the, arrest, of, those, in, error, the, citadel, of, the, reformatory, movement, was, oxford, where, wycliffe, s, most, active, helpers, were, these, were, laid, under, the, ban, and, summoned, to, recant, and, nicholas, of, hereford, went, to, rome, to, appeal, on, 17, november, 1382, wycliffe, was, summoned, before, a, synod, at, oxford, he, still, commanded, the, favour, of, the, court, and, of, parliament, to, which, he, addressed, a, memorial, he, was, neither, excommunicated, then, nor, deprived, of, his, living, wycliffe, aimed, to, do, away, with, the, existing, hierarchy, and, replace, it, with, the, poor, priests, who, lived, in, poverty, were, bound, by, no, vows, had, received, no, formal, consecration, and, preached, the, gospel, to, the, people, itinerant, preachers, spread, the, teachings, of, wycliffe, the, bull, of, gregory, xi, impressed, upon, them, the, name, of, lollards, intended, as, an, opprobrious, epithet, but, it, became, to, them, a, name, of, honour, even, in, wycliffe, s, time, the, lollards, had, reached, wide, circles, in, england, and, preached, god, s, law, without, which, no, one, could, be, justified, in, the, years, before, his, death, in, 1384, he, increasingly, argued, for, scriptures, as, the, authoritative, centre, of, christianity, that, the, claims, of, the, papacy, were, unhistorical, that, monasticism, was, irredeemably, corrupt, and, that, the, moral, unworthiness, of, priests, invalidated, their, office, and, sacraments, wycliffe, returned, to, lutterworth, from, there, he, sent, out, tracts, against, the, monks, and, pope, urban, vi, urban, vi, contrary, to, wycliffe, s, hopes, had, not, turned, out, to, be, a, reforming, pope, the, literary, achievements, of, wycliffe, s, last, days, such, as, the, trialogus, stand, at, the, peak, of, the, knowledge, of, his, day, his, last, work, the, opus, evangelicum, the, last, part, of, which, he, named, in, characteristic, fashion, of, antichrist, remained, uncompleted, while, he, was, saying, mass, in, the, parish, church, on, holy, innocents, day, 28, december, 1384, he, suffered, a, stroke, and, died, a, few, days, later, the, anti, lollard, statute, of, 1401, de, heretico, comburendo, classed, heresy, as, a, form, of, sedition, or, treason, and, ordered, that, lollard, books, frequently, associated, with, wycliffe, be, handed, over, and, burnt, someone, who, refused, and, would, not, abjure, could, be, burnt, the, constitutions, of, oxford, of, 1408, established, rules, in, oxford, university, and, specifically, named, john, wycliffe, as, it, lollard, writings, as, heretical, it, decreed, that, new, translation, efforts, of, scripture, into, english, should, be, first, authorized, by, a, bishop, the, council, of, constance, declared, wycliffe, a, heretic, on, 4, may, 1415, and, banned, his, writings, the, council, decreed, that, wycliffe, s, works, should, be, burned, and, his, bodily, remains, removed, from, consecrated, church, ground, following, the, customary, logic, that, heretics, had, put, themselves, outside, the, church, this, order, confirmed, by, pope, martin, v, was, eventually, carried, out, in, 1428, wycliffe, s, corpse, or, a, neighbour, s, 121, was, exhumed, on, the, orders, of, the, bishop, the, remains, were, burned, and, the, ashes, drowned, in, the, river, swift, which, flows, through, lutterworth, none, of, wycliffe, s, contemporaries, left, a, complete, picture, of, his, person, his, life, and, his, activities, paintings, representing, wycliffe, are, from, a, later, period, in, the, testimony, of, william, thorpe, 1407, possibly, apocryphal, wycliffe, appears, wasted, and, physically, weak, thorpe, says, wycliffe, was, of, unblemished, walk, in, life, and, regarded, affectionately, by, people, of, rank, who, often, consorted, with, him, took, down, his, sayings, and, clung, to, him, i, indeed, clove, to, none, closer, than, to, him, the, wisest, and, most, blessed, of, all, men, whom, i, have, ever, found, wycliffe, is, said, to, have, written, about, two, hundred, works, in, latin, and, middle, english, there, are, few, experts, in, 14th, century, scholastic, latin, and, many, of, wycliffe, s, latin, works, have, not, been, translated, into, english, which, has, limited, their, study, by, historians, his, theological, and, political, works, include, numerous, books, and, tracts, most, historians, hold, that, few, to, none, of, the, middle, english, works, ascribed, to, wycliffe, can, be, confidently, attributed, to, him, in, contrast, to, the, latin, works, 8, with, the, possible, exception, of, six, on, the, pastoral, office, on, the, pope, on, the, church, and, her, members, of, confession, of, pseudo, friars, and, of, dominion, according, to, tradition, wycliffe, is, said, to, have, completed, a, translation, direct, from, the, vulgate, into, middle, english, a, version, now, known, as, wycliffe, s, bible, he, may, have, personally, translated, the, gospels, of, matthew, mark, luke, and, john, but, it, is, possible, he, initially, translated, the, entire, new, testament, early, version, it, is, assumed, that, his, associates, translated, the, old, testament, and, revised, the, late, version, wycliffe, s, bible, appears, to, have, been, completed, prior, to, 1384, with, additional, updated, versions, being, done, by, wycliffe, s, assistant, john, purvey, and, others, in, 1388, and, 1395, more, recently, historians, of, the, wycliffite, movement, have, suggested, that, wycliffe, had, at, most, a, minor, role, in, the, actual, translations, or, contributed, ad, hoc, passages, taken, from, his, english, theological, writings, with, some, building, on, the, earlier, theories, of, francis, aidan, gasquet, going, as, far, as, to, suggest, he, had, no, role, in, the, translations, other, than, the, translation, projects, perhaps, being, inspired, at, least, partially, by, wycliffe, s, biblicism, at, oxford, but, otherwise, being, orthodox, catholic, translations, later, co, opted, by, his, followers, in, keeping, with, wycliffe, s, belief, that, scripture, was, the, only, authoritative, reliable, guide, to, the, truth, about, god, he, is, said, to, have, become, involved, in, efforts, to, translate, the, bible, into, english, however, while, wycliffe, is, popularly, credited, it, is, not, possible, exactly, to, define, his, part, if, any, in, the, translations, which, were, based, on, the, vulgate, in, common, belief, from, only, decades, after, the, translations, it, was, his, initiative, and, the, success, of, the, project, was, due, to, his, leadership, 93, for, the, initial, early, version, ev, the, rendering, of, the, old, testament, is, attributed, to, his, friend, nicholas, of, hereford, the, rendering, of, some, of, the, new, testament, has, been, traditionally, attributed, to, wycliffe, the, whole, was, revised, perhaps, by, wycliffe, s, younger, contemporary, john, purvey, in, 1388, known, as, the, late, version, lv, linguistic, analysis, however, suggests, there, were, multiple, translators, for, both, ev, and, lv, translations, there, still, exist, over, 200, manuscripts, complete, or, partial, mainly, containing, the, translation, in, its, lv, form, from, this, it, is, possible, to, infer, that, texts, were, widely, diffused, in, the, 15th, century, for, this, reason, the, wycliffites, in, england, were, often, designated, by, their, opponents, as, bible, men, it, has, been, noted, however, that, the, vocabulary, in, english, wycliffite, sermons, doesn, t, typically, match, that, found, in, the, ev, or, lv, historian, s, harrison, thomson, notes, that, wycliff, s, theology, was, on, a, broader, canvas, than, the, continental, reformation, however, of, the, major, protestant, notes, he, certainly, advocated, the, supremacy, of, scripture, over, tradition, however, it, is, difficult, to, find, justification, by, faith, alone, or, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, espoused, in, his, works, no, reformer, adopted, his, view, that, every, verse, in, scripture, was, in, some, way, literally, true, wycliffe, had, come, to, regard, the, scriptures, as, the, only, reliable, guide, to, the, truth, about, god, and, maintained, that, all, christians, should, rely, on, the, bible, rather, than, on, the, teachings, of, popes, and, clerics, he, said, that, there, was, no, scriptural, justification, for, the, papacy, theologically, his, preaching, expressed, a, strong, belief, in, predestination, that, enabled, him, to, declare, an, invisible, church, of, the, elect, made, up, of, those, predestined, to, be, saved, rather, than, in, the, visible, catholic, church, to, wycliffe, the, church, was, the, totality, of, those, who, are, predestined, to, blessedness, no, one, who, is, eternally, lost, has, part, in, it, there, is, one, universal, church, and, outside, of, it, there, is, no, salvation, his, first, tracts, and, greater, works, of, ecclesiastical, political, content, defended, the, privileges, of, the, state, by, 1379, in, his, de, ecclesia, on, the, church, wycliffe, clearly, claimed, the, supremacy, of, the, king, over, the, priesthood, he, also, rejected, the, selling, of, indulgences, the, battle, against, what, he, saw, as, an, imperialised, papacy, and, its, supporters, the, sects, as, he, called, the, monastic, orders, takes, up, a, large, space, not, only, in, his, later, works, such, as, the, trialogus, dialogus, opus, evangelicum, and, in, his, sermons, but, also, in, a, series, of, sharp, tracts, and, polemical, productions, in, latin, and, english, of, which, those, issued, in, his, later, years, have, been, collected, as, polemical, writings, in, the, 1380, objections, to, friars, he, calls, monks, the, pests, of, society, enemies, of, religion, and, patrons, and, promoters, of, every, crime, he, directed, his, strongest, criticism, against, the, friars, whose, preaching, he, considered, neither, scriptural, nor, sincere, but, motivated, by, temporal, gain, while, others, were, content, to, seek, the, reform, of, particular, errors, and, abuses, wycliffe, sought, nothing, less, than, the, extinction, of, the, institution, itself, as, being, repugnant, to, scripture, and, his, theology, of, apostolic, poverty, and, inconsistent, with, the, order, and, prosperity, of, the, church, he, advocated, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, rudolph, buddensieg, finds, two, distinct, aspects, in, wycliffe, s, work, the, first, from, 1366, to, 1378, reflects, a, political, struggle, with, rome, while, 1378, to, 1384, is, more, a, religious, struggle, in, each, wycliffe, has, two, approaches, he, attacks, both, the, papacy, and, its, institutions, and, also, roman, catholic, doctrine, wycliffe, s, influence, was, never, greater, than, at, the, moment, when, pope, and, antipope, sent, their, ambassadors, to, england, to, gain, recognition, for, themselves, in, 1378, in, the, ambassadors, presence, he, delivered, an, opinion, before, parliament, that, showed, in, an, important, ecclesiastical, political, question, the, matter, of, the, right, of, asylum, in, westminster, abbey, a, position, that, was, to, the, liking, of, the, state, he, argued, that, criminals, who, had, taken, sanctuary, in, churches, might, lawfully, be, dragged, out, of, sanctuary, the, books, and, tracts, of, wycliffe, s, last, six, years, include, continual, attacks, upon, the, papacy, and, the, entire, hierarchy, of, his, times, each, year, they, focus, more, and, more, and, at, the, last, the, pope, and, the, antichrist, seem, to, him, practically, equivalent, concepts, yet, there, are, passages, which, are, moderate, in, tone, g, v, lechler, identifies, three, stages, in, wycliffe, s, relations, with, the, papacy, the, first, step, which, carried, him, to, the, outbreak, of, the, schism, involves, moderate, recognition, of, the, papal, primacy, the, second, which, carried, him, to, 1381, is, marked, by, an, estrangement, from, the, papacy, and, the, third, shows, him, in, sharp, contest, wycliffe, was, a, prominent, english, theologian, and, scholastic, philosopher, of, the, second, half, of, the, 14th, century, he, earned, his, great, repute, as, a, philosopher, at, an, early, date, henry, knighton, says, that, in, philosophy, he, was, second, to, none, and, in, scholastic, discipline, incomparable, there, was, a, period, in, his, life, when, he, devoted, himself, exclusively, to, scholastic, philosophy, his, first, book, latin, de, logica, 1360, explores, the, fundamentals, of, scholastic, theology, he, believed, that, one, should, study, logic, in, order, to, better, understand, the, human, mind, because, human, thoughts, feelings, and, actions, bear, god, s, image, and, likeness, he, espoused, propositional, realism, that, a, true, proposition, maps, onto, a, truth, about, being, i, e, about, something, real, the, centre, of, wycliffe, s, philosophical, system, is, formed, by, the, doctrine, of, the, prior, existence, in, the, thought, of, god, of, all, things, and, events, while, platonic, realism, would, view, beauty, as, a, property, that, exists, in, an, ideal, form, independently, of, any, mind, or, thing, for, wycliffe, every, universal, as, part, of, creation, derived, its, existence, from, god, the, creator, wycliffe, was, a, close, follower, of, augustine, and, always, upheld, the, primacy, of, the, creator, over, the, created, reality, in, some, of, his, teachings, as, in, latin, de, annihilatione, the, influence, of, thomas, aquinas, can, be, detected, he, said, that, democritus, plato, augustine, and, grosseteste, far, outranked, aristotle, so, far, as, his, relations, to, the, philosophers, of, the, middle, ages, are, concerned, he, held, to, realism, as, opposed, to, the, nominalism, advanced, by, william, of, ockham, a, number, of, wycliffe, s, ideas, have, been, carried, forward, in, the, twentieth, century, by, philosopher, and, reformed, theologian, cornelius, van, til, a, second, key, point, of, wycliffe, s, is, his, emphasis, on, the, notion, of, divine, lordship, latin, dominium, latin, de, dominio, divino, c, 1373, examines, the, relationship, between, god, and, his, creatures, the, practical, application, of, this, for, wycliffe, was, seen, in, the, rebellious, attitude, of, individuals, particulars, towards, rightful, authority, universals, beyond, all, doubt, intellectual, and, emotional, error, about, universals, is, the, cause, of, all, sin, that, reigns, in, the, world, in, latin, de, civili, dominio, on, civil, dominion, c, 1377, he, discusses, the, appropriate, circumstance, under, which, an, entity, may, be, seen, as, possessing, authority, over, lesser, subjects, latin, dominium, is, always, conferred, by, god, injuries, inflicted, on, someone, personally, by, a, king, should, be, born, by, them, submissively, a, conventional, idea, but, injuries, by, a, king, against, god, should, be, patiently, resisted, even, to, death, gravely, sinful, kings, and, popes, forfeited, their, divine, right, to, obedience, versions, of, this, were, taken, up, by, lollards, and, hussites, wycliffe, s, fundamental, principle, of, the, preexistence, in, thought, of, all, reality, involves, the, most, serious, obstacle, to, freedom, of, the, will, the, philosopher, could, assist, himself, only, by, the, formula, that, the, free, will, of, man, was, something, predetermined, of, god, he, demanded, strict, dialectical, training, as, the, means, of, distinguishing, the, true, from, the, false, and, asserted, that, logic, or, the, syllogism, furthered, the, knowledge, of, catholic, verities, ignorance, of, logic, was, the, reason, why, men, misunderstood, scripture, since, men, overlooked, the, connection, the, distinction, between, idea, and, appearance, wycliffe, was, not, merely, conscious, of, the, distinction, between, theology, and, philosophy, but, his, sense, of, reality, led, him, to, pass, by, scholastic, questions, he, left, aside, philosophical, discussions, that, seemed, to, have, no, significance, for, the, religious, consciousness, and, those, that, pertained, purely, to, scholasticism, we, concern, ourselves, with, the, verities, that, are, and, leave, aside, the, errors, which, arise, from, speculation, on, matters, which, are, not, john, wycliffe, rejected, transubstantiation, along, with, the, sacrament, of, confession, saying, they, were, against, scripture, wycliffe, was, attacked, as, being, a, donatist, however, the, claim, was, a, misconception, perhaps, used, to, discredit, his, views, on, the, eucharist, the, consecrated, host, we, priests, make, and, bless, is, not, the, body, of, the, lord, but, an, effectual, sign, of, it, it, is, not, to, be, understood, that, the, body, of, christ, comes, down, from, heaven, to, the, host, consecrated, in, every, church, wycliffe, appears, to, have, had, similar, ideas, of, justification, as, the, later, reformers, would, according, to, wycliffe, faith, was, sufficient, for, salvation, trust, wholly, in, christ, rely, altogether, on, his, sufferings, beware, of, seeking, to, be, justified, in, any, other, way, than, by, his, righteousness, faith, in, our, lord, jesus, christ, is, sufficient, for, salvation, wycliffe, expressed, his, theories, in, the, book, latin, de, veritate, sacrae, scripturae, on, the, truthfulness, of, holy, scripture, c, 1378, wycliffe, s, dictum, latin, omnis, veritas, est, ex, scriptura, et, ut, necessarior, est, expressior, says, that, all, truths, necessary, to, faith, are, found, expressly, in, the, bible, and, the, more, necessary, the, more, expressly, 67, this, proposition, was, later, taken, up, by, martin, luther, the, whole, of, scripture, is, one, word, of, god, latin, tota, scriptura, sacra, est, unum, dei, verbum, being, a, monologue, by, the, same, author, meant, that, sentences, from, different, books, could, be, combined, without, much, regard, for, context, supporting, strained, and, mystical, interpretations, 23, 28, the, scriptures, were, literally, true, latin, sensus, literalis, est, utrobique, verus, cum, non, asseritur, a, recte, intelligentibus, unless, obviously, figurative, to, the, extent, that, when, jesus, spoke, in, parables, he, was, reporting, events, that, had, actually, occurred, 34, psalm, 22, v6, i, am, a, worm, and, no, man, which, pseudo, dionysius, had, memorably, used, to, give, worm, as, a, name, of, god, became, in, wycliffe, s, extreme, literalism, a, statement, that, jesus, had, been, begotten, without, sexual, contact, as, was, then, believed, of, worms, and, was, formally, god, not, a, simply, man, 32, the, literal, sense, of, scripture, is, that, sense, which, the, holy, ghost, first, imparted, so, that, the, faithful, soul, might, ascend, to, god, latin, sensum, literalem, scripture, sensum, quem, spiritus, sanctus, primo, indidit, ut, animus, fidelis, ascendat, in, deum, 36, wycliffe, wrote, of, progessive, stages, of, scriptural, interpretation, the, plain, or, literal, reading, of, text, and, its, interpretation, being, the, most, basic, leading, to, a, mystical, understanding, of, the, sense, of, the, author, leading, finally, to, seeing, the, book, of, life, which, contains, every, truth, however, historians, have, suggested, that, this, mystical, view, allowed, wycliffe, to, work, backwards, back, fitting, his, reading, of, scripture, to, suit, his, theological, views, indeed, wycliffe, maintains, that, the, christian, faith, would, persist, even, if, all, biblical, codices, were, burnt, up, or, otherwise, destroyed, wycliffe, is, popularly, connected, with, the, view, that, scriptures, should, be, translated, into, the, vernacular, and, made, available, to, laymen, and, that, this, was, a, critical, issue, in, the, censures, against, him, however, scholars, have, noted, the, availability, of, scriptures, to, laypeople, in, the, vernacular, was, not, a, notable, theme, of, wycliffe, s, theological, works, it, is, mentioned, in, his, de, xxxiii, erroribus, curitatum, chapter, 26, against, those, who, would, stop, secular, men, from, intermeddling, with, the, gospel, 27, nor, were, there, any, church, wide, bans, on, vernacular, scriptures, in, place, that, wycliffe, might, be, regarded, as, protesting, against, it, was, not, part, of, wycliffe, s, 1377, papal, censure, nor, the, declaration, of, heresy, by, the, council, of, constance, 1415, vernacular, scriptures, were, not, mentioned, in, the, two, key, early, lollard, documents, regarded, as, channelling, his, doctrine, the, twelve, conclusions, c, 1396, and, the, thirty, seven, conclusions, c, 1396, or, remonstrances, wycliffe, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, a, translation, of, the, bible, in, english, thus, making, it, accessible, to, english, speakers, with, poor, latin, though, whether, he, himself, translated, the, bible, in, part, or, whole, or, merely, played, a, part, in, motivating, its, translation, indirectly, through, his, revival, of, oxford, biblical, studies, is, a, matter, of, debate, his, theology, also, had, a, strong, influence, on, jan, hus, hus,

variants, are, popular, given, names, presumably, starting, in, some, protestant, communities, for, example, haitian, rapper, and, musician, wyclef, jean, in, the, centre, of, lutterworth, a, grade, ii, listed, memorial, obelisk, to, wycliffe, was, erected, in, june, 1897, on, a, site, behind, which, the, wycliffe, memorial, methodist, church, was, built, a, few, years, later, for, the, town, s,
