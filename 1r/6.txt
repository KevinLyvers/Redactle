petrified, forest, in, 1935, the, play, seemed, ideal, for, the, studio, which, was, known, for, its, socially, realistic, pictures, for, a, public, entranced, by, real, life, criminals, such, as, john, dillinger, and, dutch, schultz, bette, davis, and, leslie, howard, were, cast, howard, who, held, the, production, rights, made, it, clear, that, he, wanted, bogart, to, star, with, him, the, studio, tested, several, hollywood, veterans, for, the, duke, mantee, role, and, chose, edward, g, robinson, who, had, star, appeal, and, was, due, to, make, a, film, to, fulfill, his, contract,

times, that, the, actor, can, be, a, psychopathic, gangster, more, like, dillinger, than, the, outlaw, himself, the, film, was, successful, at, the, box, office, earning, 500, 000, in, rentals, and, made, bogart, a, star, he, never, forgot, howard, s, favor, and, named, his, only, daughter, leslie, howard, bogart, after, him, in, 1952, despite, his, success, in, the, petrified, forest, an, a, movie, bogart, signed, a, tepid, 26, week, contract, at, 550, per, week, and, was, typecast, as, a, gangster, in, a, series, of, b, movie, crime, dramas, although, he, was, proud, of, his, success, the, fact, that, it, derived, from, gangster, roles, weighed, on, him, i, can, t, get, in, a, mild, discussion, without, turning, it, into, an, argument, there, must, be, something, in, my, tone, of, voice, or, this, arrogant, face, something, that, antagonizes, everybody, nobody, likes, me, on, sight, i, suppose, that, s, why, i, m, cast, as, the, heavy, in, spite, of, his, success, warner, bros, had, no, interest, in, raising, bogart, s, profile, his, roles, were, repetitive, and, physically, demanding, studios, were, not, yet, air, conditioned, and, his, tightly, scheduled, job, at, warners, was, anything, but, the, indolent, and, peachy, actor, s, life, he, hoped, for, although, bogart, disliked, the, roles, chosen, for, him, he, worked, steadily, in, the, first, 34, pictures, for, warner, s, he, told, journalist, george, frazier, i, was, shot, in, 12, electrocuted, or, hanged, in, 8, and, was, a, jailbird, in, 9, he, averaged, a, film, every, two, months, between, 1936, and, 1940, sometimes, working, on, two, films, at, the, same, time, bogart, used, these, years, to, begin, developing, his, film, persona, a, wounded, stoical, cynical, charming, vulnerable, self, mocking, loner, with, a, code, of, honor, amenities, at, warners, were, few, compared, to, the, prestigious, metro, goldwyn, mayer, bogart, thought, that, the, warners, wardrobe, department, was, cheap, and, often, wore, his, own, suits, in, his, films, he, chose, his, own, dog, named, zero, to, play, pard, his, character, s, dog, in, high, sierra, his, disputes, with, warner, bros, over, roles, and, money, were, similar, to, those, waged, by, the, studio, with, more, established, and, less, malleable, stars, such, as, bette, davis, and, james, cagney, leading, men, at, warner, bros, included, george, raft, james, cagney, and, edward, g, robinson, most, of, the, studio, s, better, scripts, went, to, them, or, others, leaving, bogart, with, what, was, left, films, like, san, quentin, 1937, racket, busters, 1938, and, you, can, t, get, away, with, murder, 1939, his, only, leading, role, during, this, period, was, in, dead, end, 1937, on, loan, to, samuel, goldwyn, as, a, gangster, modeled, after, baby, face, nelson, bogart, played, violent, roles, so, often, that, in, nevil, shute, s, 1939, novel, what, happened, to, the, corbetts, the, protagonist, replies, i, ve, seen, humphrey, bogart, with, one, often, enough, when, asked, if, he, knows, how, to, operate, an, automatic, weapon, although, he, played, a, variety, of, supporting, roles, in, films, such, as, angels, with, dirty, faces, 1938, bogart, s, roles, were, either, rivals, of, characters, played, by, cagney, and, robinson, or, a, secondary, member, of, their, gang, in, black, legion, 1937, a, movie,

its, accompanying, recognition, bogart, later, said, the, way, to, survive, an, oscar, is, never, to, try, to, win, another, one, too, many, stars, win, it, and, then, figure, they, have, to, top, themselves, they, become, afraid, to, take, chances, the, result, a, lot, of, dull, performances, in, dull, pictures, the, african, queen, was, bogart, s, first, starring, technicolor, role, bogart, dropped, his, asking, price, to, obtain, the, role, of, captain, queeg, in, edward, dmytryk, s, drama, the, caine, mutiny, 1954, though, he, retained, some, of, his, old, bitterness, about, having, to, do, so, he, delivered, a, strong, performance, in, the, lead, he, received, his, final, oscar, nomination, and, was, the, subject, of, a, june, 7, 1954, time, magazine, cover, story, despite, his, success, bogart, was, still, melancholy, he, grumbled, to, and, feuded, with, the, studio, while, his, health, began, to, deteriorate, like, his, portrayal, of, fred, c, dobbs, in, the, treasure, of, the, sierra, madre, bogart, s, queeg, is, a, paranoid, self, pitying, character, whose, small, mindedness, eventually, destroys, him, henry, fonda, played, a, different, role, in, the, broadway, version, of, the, caine, mutiny, generating, publicity, for, the, film, for, sabrina, 1954, billy, wilder, wanted, cary, grant, for, the, older, male, lead, and, chose, bogart, to, play, the, conservative, brother, who, competes, with, his, younger, playboy, sibling, william, holden, for, the, affection, of, the, cinderella, like, sabrina, audrey, hepburn, although, bogart, was, lukewarm, about, the, part, he, agreed, to, it, on, a, handshake, with, wilder, without, a, finished, script, but, with, the, director, s, assurance, that, he, would, take, good, care, of, bogart, during, filming, the, actor, however, got, along, poorly, with, his, director, and, co, stars, he, complained, about, the, script, s, last, minute, drafting, and, delivery, and, accused, wilder, of, favoring, hepburn, and, holden, on, and, off, the, set, wilder, was, the, opposite, of, bogart, s, ideal, director, john, huston, in, style, and, personality, bogart, complained, to, the, press, that, wilder, was, overbearing, and, is, kind, of, prussian, german, with, a, riding, crop, he, is, the, type, of, director, i, don, t, like, to, work, with, the, picture, is, a, crock, of, crap, i, got, sick, and, tired, of, who, gets, sabrina, wilder, later, said, we, parted, as, enemies, but, finally, made, up, despite, the, acrimony, the, film, was, successful, according, to, a, review, in, the, new, york, times, bogart, was, incredibly, adroit, the, skill, with, which, this, old, rock, ribbed, actor, blends, the, gags, and, such, duplicities, with, a, manly, manner, of, melting, is, one, of, the, incalculable, joys, of, the, show, joseph, l, mankiewicz, s, the, barefoot, contessa, 1954, was, filmed, in, rome, in, this, hollywood, backstory, bogart, is, a, broken, down, man, a, cynical,

closeups, because, my, eyes, are, too, watery, a, little, while, later, after, the, film, somebody, came, up, to, me, with, word, of, bogey, s, death, then, it, struck, me, his, eyes, were, watery,
