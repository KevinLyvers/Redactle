demonstrated, a, keen, interest, in, the, welfare, of, london, s, impoverished, dockland, communities, in, 1889, a, bitter, trade, dispute, broke, out, in, london, with, dockers, striking, for, better, pay, and, conditions, and, seamen, shipbuilders, factory, girls, and, other, joining, the, strike, in, solidarity, the, strikers, were, successful, in, part, due, to, the, mediation, of,

time, in, london, gandhi, tried, to, adopt, english, customs, including, taking, dancing, lessons, however, he, didn, t, appreciate, the, bland, vegetarian, food, offered, by, his, landlady, and, was, frequently, hungry, until, he, found, one, of, london, s, few, vegetarian, restaurants, influenced, by, henry, salt, s, writing, gandhi, joined, the, london, vegetarian, society, and, was, elected, to, its, executive, committee, under, the, aegis, of, its, president, and, benefactor, arnold, hills, an, achievement, while, on, the, committee, was, the, establishment, of, a, bayswater, chapter, some, of, the, vegetarians, gandhi, met, were, members, of, the, theosophical, society, which, had, been, founded, in, 1875, to, further, universal, brotherhood, and, which, was, devoted, to, the, study, of, buddhist, and, hindu, literature, they, encouraged, gandhi, to, join, them, in, reading, the, bhagavad, gita, both, in, translation, as, well, as, in, the, original, gandhi, had, a, friendly, and, productive, relationship, with, hills, but, the, two, men, took, a, different, view, on, the, continued, lvs, membership, of, fellow, committee, member, thomas, allinson, their, disagreement, is, the, first, known, example, of, gandhi, challenging, authority, despite, his, shyness, and, temperamental, disinclination, towards, confrontation, allinson, had, been, promoting, newly, available, birth, control, methods, but, hills, disapproved, of, these, believing, they, undermined, public, morality, he, believed, vegetarianism, to, be, a, moral, movement, and, that, allinson, should, therefore, no, longer, remain, a, member, of, the, lvs, gandhi, shared, hills, views, on, the, dangers, of, birth, control, but, defended, allinson, s, right, to, differ, it, would, have, been, hard, for, gandhi, to, challenge, hills, hills, was, 12, years, his, senior, and, unlike, gandhi, highly, eloquent, hills, bankrolled, the, lvs, and, was, a, captain, of, industry, with, his, thames, ironworks, company, employing, more, than, 6, 000, people, in, the, east, end, of, london, hills, was, also, a, highly, accomplished, sportsman, who, later, founded, the, football, club, west, ham, united, in, his, 1927, an, autobiography, vol, i, gandhi, wrote, the, question, deeply, interested, me, i, had, a, high, regard, for, mr, hills, and, his, generosity, but, i, thought, it, was, quite, improper, to, exclude, a, man, from, a, vegetarian, society, simply, because, he, refused, to, regard, puritan, morals, as, one, of, the, objects, of, the, society, a, motion, to, remove, allinson, was, raised, and, was, debated, and, voted, on, by, the, committee, gandhi, s, shyness, was, an, obstacle, to, his, defence, of, allinson, at, the, committee, meeting, gandhi, wrote, his, views, down, on, paper, but, shyness, prevented, gandhi, from, reading, out, his, arguments, so, hills, the, president, asked, another, committee, member, to, read, them, out, for, him, although, some, other, members, of, the, committee, agreed, with, gandhi, the, vote, was, lost, and, allinson, was, excluded, there, were, no, hard, feelings, with, hills, proposing, the, toast, at, the, lvs, farewell, dinner, in, honour, of, gandhi, s, return, to, india, gandhi, at, age, 22, was, called, to, the, bar, in, june, 1891, and, then, left, london, for, india, where, he, learned, that, his, mother, had, died, while, he, was, in, london, and, that, his, family, had, kept, the, news, from, gandhi, his, attempts, at, establishing, a, law, practice, in, bombay, failed, because, gandhi, was, psychologically, unable, to, cross, examine, witnesses, he, returned, to, rajkot, to, make, a, modest, living, drafting, petitions, for, litigants, but, gandhi, was, forced, to, stop, after, running, afoul, of, british, officer, sam, sunny, in, 1893, a, muslim, merchant, in, kathiawar, named, dada, abdullah, contacted, gandhi, abdullah, owned, a, large, successful, shipping, business, in, south, africa, his, distant, cousin, in, johannesburg, needed, a, lawyer, and, they, preferred, someone, with, kathiawari, heritage, gandhi, inquired, about, his, pay, for, the, work, they, offered, a, total, salary, of, 105, 4, 143, in, 2023, money, plus, travel, expenses, he, accepted, it, knowing, that, it, would, be, at, least, a, one, year, commitment, in, the, colony, of, natal, south, africa, also, a, part, of, the, british, empire, in, april, 1893, gandhi, aged, 23, set, sail, for, south, africa, to, be, the, lawyer, for, abdullah, s, cousin, gandhi, spent, 21, years, in, south, africa, where, he, developed, his, political, views, ethics, and, politics, immediately, upon, arriving, in, south, africa, gandhi, faced, discrimination, due, to, his, skin, colour, and, heritage, gandhi, was, not, allowed, to, sit, with, european, passengers, in, the, stagecoach, and, was, told, to, sit, on, the, floor, near, the, driver, then, beaten, when, he, refused, elsewhere, gandhi, was, kicked, into, a, gutter, for, daring, to, walk, near, a, house, in, another, instance, thrown, off, a, train, at, pietermaritzburg, after, refusing, to, leave, the, first, class, gandhi, sat, in, the, train, station, shivering, all, night, and, pondering, if, he, should, return, to, india, or, protest, for, his, rights, gandhi, chose, to, protest, and, was, allowed, to, board, the, train, the, next, day, in, another, incident, the, magistrate, of, a, durban, court, ordered, gandhi, to, remove, his, turban, which, he, refused, to, do, indians, were, not, allowed, to, walk, on, public, footpaths, in, south, africa, gandhi, was, kicked, by, a, police, officer, out, of, the, footpath, onto, the, street, without, warning, when, gandhi, arrived, in, south, africa, according, to, arthur, herman, he, thought, of, himself, as, a, briton, first, and, an, indian, second, however, the, prejudice, against, gandhi, and, his, fellow, indians, from, british, people, that, gandhi, experienced, and, observed, deeply, bothered, him, gandhi, found, it, humiliating, struggling, to, understand, how, some, people, can, feel, honour, or, superiority, or, pleasure, in, such, inhumane, practices, gandhi, began, to, question, his, people, s, standing, in, the, british, empire, the, abdullah, case, that, had, brought, him, to, south, africa, concluded, in, may, 1894, and, the, indian, community, organised, a, farewell, party, for, gandhi, as, he, prepared, to, return, to, india, however, a, new, natal, government, discriminatory, proposal, led, to, gandhi, extending, his, original, period, of, stay, in, south, africa, gandhi, planned, to, assist, indians, in, opposing, a, bill, to, deny, them, the, right, to, vote, a, right, then, proposed, to, be, an, exclusive, european, right, he, asked, joseph, chamberlain, the, british, colonial, secretary, to, reconsider, his, position, on, this, bill, though, unable, to, halt, the, bill, s, passage, gandhi, s, campaign, was, successful, in, drawing, attention, to, the, grievances, of, indians, in, south, africa, he, helped, found, the, natal, indian, congress, in, 1894, and, through, this, organisation, gandhi, moulded, the, indian, community, of, south, africa, into, a, unified, political, force, in, january, 1897, when, gandhi, landed, in, durban, a, mob, of, white, settlers, attacked, him, and, gandhi, escaped, only, through, the, efforts, of, the, wife, of, the, police, superintendent, however, gandhi, refused, to, press, charges, against, any, member, of, the, mob, during, the, boer, war, gandhi, volunteered, in, 1900, to, form, a, group, of, stretcher, bearers, as, the, natal, indian, ambulance, corps, according, to, arthur, herman, gandhi, wanted, to, disprove, the, british, colonial, stereotype, that, hindus, were, not, fit, for, manly, activities, involving, danger, and, exertion, unlike, the, muslim, martial, races, gandhi, raised, 1, 100, indian, volunteers, to, support, british, combat, troops, against, the, boers, they, were, trained, and, medically, certified, to, serve, on, the, front, lines, they, were, auxiliaries, at, the, battle, of, colenso, to, a, white, volunteer, ambulance, corps, at, the, battle, of, spion, kop, gandhi, and, his, bearers, moved, to, the, front, line, and, had, to, carry, wounded, soldiers, for, miles, to, a, field, hospital, since, the, terrain, was, too, rough, for, the, ambulances, gandhi, and, 37, other, indians, received, the, queen, s, south, africa, medal, in, 1906, the, transvaal, government, promulgated, a, new, act, compelling, registration, of, the, colony, s, indian, and, chinese, populations, at, a, mass, protest, meeting, held, in, johannesburg, on, 11, september, that, year, gandhi, adopted, his, still, evolving, methodology, of, satyagraha, devotion, to, the, truth, or, nonviolent, protest, for, the, first, time, according, to, anthony, parel, gandhi, was, also, influenced, by, the, tamil, moral, text, tirukku, a, after, leo, tolstoy, mentioned, it, in, their, correspondence, that, began, with, a, letter, to, a, hindu, gandhi, urged, indians, to, defy, the, new, law, and, to, suffer, the, punishments, for, doing, so, his, ideas, of, protests, persuasion, skills, and, public, relations, had, emerged, gandhi, took, these, back, to, india, in, 1915, gandhi, focused, his, attention, on, indians, and, africans, while, he, was, in, south, africa, initially, gandhi, was, not, interested, in, politics, but, this, changed, after, he, was, discriminated, against, and, bullied, such, as, by, being, thrown, out, of, a, train, coach, due, to, his, skin, colour, by, a, white, train, official, after, several, such, incidents, with, whites, in, south, africa, gandhi, s, thinking, and, focus, changed, and, he, felt, he, must, resist, this, and, fight, for, rights, gandhi, entered, politics, by, forming, the, natal, indian, congress, according, to, ashwin, desai, and, goolam, vahed, gandhi, s, views, on, racism, are, contentious, in, some, cases, he, suffered, persecution, from, the, beginning, in, south, africa, like, with, other, coloured, people, white, officials, denied, gandhi, his, rights, and, the, press, and, those, in, the, streets, bullied, and, called, gandhi, a, parasite, semi, barbarous, canker, squalid, coolie, yellow, man, and, other, epithets, people, would, even, spit, on, him, as, an, expression, of, racial, hate, while, in, south, africa, gandhi, focused, on, the, racial, persecution, of, indians, before, he, started, to, focus, on, racism, against, africans, in, some, cases, state, desai, and, vahed, gandhi, s, behaviour, was, one, of, being, a, willing, part, of, racial, stereotyping, and, african, exploitation, during, a, speech, in, september, 1896, gandhi, complained, that, the, whites, in, the, british, colony, of, south, africa, were, degrading, the, indian, to, the, level, of, a, raw, kaffir, scholars, cite, it, as, an, example, of, evidence, that, gandhi, at, that, time, thought, of, indians, and, black, south, africans, differently, as, another, example, given, by, herman, gandhi, at, the, age, of, 24, prepared, a, legal, brief, for, the, natal, assembly, in, 1895, seeking, voting, rights, for, indians, gandhi, cited, race, history, and, european, orientalists, opinions, that, anglo, saxons, and, indians, are, sprung, from, the, same, aryan, stock, or, rather, the, indo, european, peoples, and, argued, that, indians, should, not, be, grouped, with, the, africans, years, later, gandhi, and, his, colleagues, served, and, helped, africans, as, nurses, and, by, opposing, racism, the, nobel, peace, prize, winner, nelson, mandela, is, among, admirers, of, gandhi, s, efforts, to, fight, against, racism, in, africa, the, general, image, of, gandhi, state, desai, and, vahed, has, been, reinvented, since, his, assassination, as, though, gandhi, was, always, a, saint, when, in, reality, his, life, was, more, complex, contained, inconvenient, truths, and, was, one, that, changed, over, time, scholars, have, also, pointed, the, evidence, to, a, rich, history, of, co, operation, and, efforts, by, gandhi, and, indian, people, with, nonwhite, south, africans, against, persecution, of, africans, and, the, apartheid, in, 1906, when, the, bambatha, rebellion, broke, out, in, the, colony, of, natal, the, then, 36, year, old, gandhi, despite, sympathising, with, the, zulu, rebels, encouraged, indian, south, africans, to, form, a, volunteer, stretcher, bearer, unit, writing, in, the, indian, opinion, gandhi, argued, that, military, service, would, be, beneficial, to, the, indian, community, and, claimed, it, would, give, them, health, and, happiness, gandhi, eventually, led, a, volunteer, mixed, unit, of, indian, and, african, stretcher, bearers, to, treat, wounded, combatants, during, the, suppression, of, the, rebellion, the, medical, unit, commanded, by, gandhi, operated, for, less, than, two, months, before, being, disbanded, after, the, suppression, of, the, rebellion, the, colonial, establishment, showed, no, interest, in, extending, to, the, indian, community, the, civil, rights, granted, to, white, south, africans, this, led, gandhi, to, becoming, disillusioned, with, the, empire, and, aroused, a, spiritual, awakening, with, him, historian, arthur, l, herman, wrote, that, gandhi, s, african, experience, was, a, part, of, his, great, disillusionment, with, the, west, transforming, gandhi, into, an, uncompromising, non, cooperator, by, 1910, gandhi, s, newspaper, indian, opinion, was, covering, reports, on, discrimination, against, africans, by, the, colonial, regime, gandhi, remarked, that, the, africans, are, alone, are, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, land, the, whites, on, the, other, hand, have, occupied, the, land, forcibly, and, appropriated, it, to, themselves, in, 1910, gandhi, established, with, the, help, of, his, friend, hermann, kallenbach, an, idealistic, community, they, named, tolstoy, farm, near, johannesburg, there, gandhi, nurtured, his, policy, of, peaceful, resistance, in, the, years, after, black, south, africans, gained, the, right, to, vote, in, south, africa, 1994, gandhi, was, proclaimed, a, national, hero, with, numerous, monuments, at, the, request, of, gopal, krishna, gokhale, conveyed, to, gandhi, by, c, f, andrews, gandhi, returned, to, india, in, 1915, he, brought, an, international, reputation, as, a, leading, indian, nationalist, theorist, and, community, organiser, gandhi, joined, the, indian, national, congress, and, was, introduced, to, indian, issues, politics, and, the, indian, people, primarily, by, gokhale, gokhale, was, a, key, leader, of, the, congress, party, best, known, for, his, restraint, and, moderation, and, his, insistence, on, working, inside, the, system, gandhi, took, gokhale, s, liberal, approach, based, on, british, whiggish, traditions, and, transformed, it, to, make, it, look, indian, gandhi, took, leadership, of, the, congress, in, 1920, and, began, escalating, demands, until, on, 26, january, 1930, the, indian, national, congress, declared, the, independence, of, india, the, british, did, not, recognise, the, declaration, but, negotiations, ensued, with, the, congress, taking, a, role, in, provincial, government, in, the, late, 1930s, gandhi, and, the, congress, withdrew, their, support, of, the, raj, when, the, viceroy, declared, war, on, germany, in, september, 1939, without, consultation, tensions, escalated, until, gandhi, demanded, immediate, independence, in, 1942, and, the, british, responded, by, imprisoning, him, and, tens, of, thousands, of, congress, leaders, meanwhile, the, muslim, league, did, co, operate, with, britain, and, moved, against, gandhi, s, strong, opposition, to, demands, for, a, totally, separate, muslim, state, of, pakistan, in, august, 1947, the, british, partitioned, the, land, with, india, and, pakistan, each, achieving, independence, on, terms, that, gandhi, disapproved, in, april, 1918, during, the, latter, part, of, world, war, i, the, viceroy, invited, gandhi, to, a, war, conference, in, delhi, gandhi, agreed, to, support, the, war, effort, in, contrast, to, the, zulu, war, of, 1906, and, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, when, he, recruited, volunteers, for, the, ambulance, corps, this, time, gandhi, attempted, to, recruit, combatants, in, a, june, 1918, leaflet, entitled, appeal, for, enlistment, gandhi, wrote, to, bring, about, such, a, state, of, things, we, should, have, the, ability, to, defend, ourselves, that, is, the, ability, to, bear, arms, and, to, use, them, if, we, want, to, learn, the, use, of, arms, with, the, greatest, possible, despatch, it, is, our, duty, to, enlist, ourselves, in, the, army, however, gandhi, stipulated, in, a, letter, to, the, viceroy, s, private, secretary, that, he, personally, will, not, kill, or, injure, anybody, friend, or, foe, gandhi, s, support, for, the, war, campaign, brought, into, question, his, consistency, on, nonviolence, gandhi, s, private, secretary, noted, that, the, question, of, the, consistency, between, his, creed, of, ahimsa, nonviolence, and, his, recruiting, campaign, was, raised, not, only, then, but, has, been, discussed, ever, since, according, to, political, and, educational, scientist, christian, bartolf, gandhi, s, support, for, the, war, stemmed, from, his, belief, that, true, ahimsa, could, not, exist, simultaneously, with, cowardice, therefore, gandhi, felt, that, indians, needed, to, be, willing, and, capable, of, using, arms, before, they, voluntarily, chose, non, violence, in, july, 1918, gandhi, admitted, that, he, could, not, persuade, even, one, individual, to, enlist, for, the, world, war, so, far, i, have, not, a, single, recruit, to, my, credit, apart, gandhi, wrote, he, added, they, object, because, they, fear, to, die, gandhi, s, first, major, achievement, came, in, 1917, with, the, champaran, agitation, in, bihar, the, champaran, agitation, pitted, the, local, peasantry, against, largely, anglo, indian, plantation, owners, who, were, backed, by, the, local, administration, the, peasants, were, forced, to, grow, indigo, indigofera, sp, a, cash, crop, for, indigo, dye, whose, demand, had, been, declining, over, two, decades, and, were, forced, to, sell, their, crops, to, the, planters, at, a, fixed, price, unhappy, with, this, the, peasantry, appealed, to, gandhi, at, his, ashram, in, ahmedabad, pursuing, a, strategy, of, nonviolent, protest, gandhi, took, the, administration, by, surprise, and, won, concessions, from, the, authorities, in, 1918, kheda, was, hit, by, floods, and, famine, and, the, peasantry, was, demanding, relief, from, taxes, gandhi, moved, his, headquarters, to, nadiad, organising, scores, of, supporters, and, fresh, volunteers, from, the, region, the, most, notable, being, vallabhbhai, patel, using, non, co, operation, as, a, technique, gandhi, initiated, a, signature, campaign, where, peasants, pledged, non, payment, of, revenue, even, under, the, threat, of, confiscation, of, land, a, social, boycott, of, mamlatdars, and, talatdars, revenue, officials, within, the, district, accompanied, the, agitation, gandhi, worked, hard, to, win, public, support, for, the, agitation, across, the, country, for, five, months, the, administration, refused, but, by, the, end, of, may, 1918, the, government, gave, way, on, important, provisions, and, relaxed, the, conditions, of, payment, of, revenue, tax, until, the, famine, ended, in, kheda, vallabhbhai, patel, represented, the, farmers, in, negotiations, with, the, british, who, suspended, revenue, collection, and, released, all, the, prisoners, in, 1919, following, world, war, i, gandhi, aged, 49, sought, political, co, operation, from, muslims, in, his, fight, against, british, imperialism, by, supporting, the, ottoman, empire, that, had, been, defeated, in, the, world, war, before, this, initiative, of, gandhi, communal, disputes, and, religious, riots, between, hindus, and, muslims, were, common, in, british, india, such, as, the, riots, of, 1917, 18, gandhi, had, already, vocally, supported, the, british, crown, in, the, first, world, war, this, decision, of, gandhi, was, in, part, motivated, by, the, british, promise, to, reciprocate, the, help, with, swaraj, self, government, to, indians, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, british, government, had, offered, instead, of, self, government, minor, reforms, instead, disappointing, gandhi, he, announced, his, satyagraha, civil, disobedience, intentions, the, british, colonial, officials, made, their, counter, move, by, passing, the, rowlatt, act, to, block, gandhi, s, movement, the, act, allowed, the, british, government, to, treat, civil, disobedience, participants, as, criminals, and, gave, it, the, legal, basis, to, arrest, anyone, for, preventive, indefinite, detention, incarceration, without, judicial, review, or, any, need, for, a, trial, gandhi, felt, that, hindu, muslim, co, operation, was, necessary, for, political, progress, against, the, british, he, leveraged, the, khilafat, movement, wherein, sunni, muslims, in, india, their, leaders, such, as, the, sultans, of, princely, states, in, india, and, ali, brothers, championed, the, turkish, caliph, as, a, solidarity, symbol, of, sunni, islamic, community, ummah, they, saw, the, caliph, as, their, means, to, support, islam, and, the, islamic, law, after, the, defeat, of, ottoman, empire, in, world, war, i, gandhi, s, support, to, the, khilafat, movement, led, to, mixed, results, it, initially, led, to, a, strong, muslim, support, for, gandhi, however, the, hindu, leaders, including, rabindranath, tagore, questioned, gandhi, s, leadership, because, they, were, largely, against, recognising, or, supporting, the, sunni, islamic, caliph, in, turkey, the, increasing, muslim, support, for, gandhi, after, he, championed, the, caliph, s, cause, temporarily, stopped, the, hindu, muslim, communal, violence, it, offered, evidence, of, inter, communal, harmony, in, joint, rowlatt, satyagraha, demonstration, rallies, raising, gandhi, s, stature, as, the, political, leader, to, the, british, his, support, for, the, khilafat, movement, also, helped, gandhi, sideline, muhammad, ali, jinnah, who, had, announced, his, opposition, to, the, satyagraha, non, co, operation, movement, approach, of, gandhi, jinnah, began, creating, his, independent, support, and, later, went, on, to, lead, the, demand, for, west, and, east, pakistan, though, they, agreed, in, general, terms, on, indian, independence, they, disagreed, on, the, means, of, achieving, this, jinnah, was, mainly, interested, in, dealing, with, the, british, via, constitutional, negotiation, rather, than, attempting, to, agitate, the, masses, in, 1922, the, khilafat, movement, gradually, collapsed, following, the, end, of, the, non, cooperation, movement, with, the, arrest, of, gandhi, a, number, of, muslim, leaders, and, delegates, abandoned, gandhi, and, congress, hindu, muslim, communal, conflicts, reignited, and, deadly, religious, riots, re, appeared, in, numerous, cities, with, 91, in, united, provinces, of, agra, and, oudh, alone, with, his, book, hind, swaraj, 1909, gandhi, aged, 40, declared, that, british, rule, was, established, in, india, with, the, co, operation, of, indians, and, had, survived, only, because, of, this, co, operation, if, indians, refused, to, co, operate, british, rule, would, collapse, and, swaraj, indian, independence, would, come, in, february, 1919, gandhi, cautioned, the, viceroy, of, india, with, a, cable, communication, that, if, the, british, were, to, pass, the, rowlatt, act, he, would, appeal, to, indians, to, start, civil, disobedience, the, british, government, ignored, him, and, passed, the, law, stating, it, would, not, yield, to, threats, the, satyagraha, civil, disobedience, followed, with, people, assembling, to, protest, the, rowlatt, act, on, 30, march, 1919, british, law, officers, opened, fire, on, an, assembly, of, unarmed, people, peacefully, gathered, participating, in, satyagraha, in, delhi, people, rioted, in, retaliation, on, 6, april, 1919, a, hindu, festival, day, gandhi, asked, a, crowd, to, remember, not, to, injure, or, kill, british, people, but, to, express, their, frustration, with, peace, to, boycott, british, goods, and, burn, any, british, clothing, they, owned, he, emphasised, the, use, of, non, violence, to, the, british, and, towards, each, other, even, if, the, other, side, used, violence, communities, across, india, announced, plans, to, gather, in, greater, numbers, to, protest,

amritsar, park, and, british, indian, army, officer, reginald, dyer, surrounded, them, and, ordered, troops, under, his, command, to, fire, on, them, the, resulting, jallianwala, bagh, massacre, or, amritsar, massacre, of, hundreds, of, sikh, and, hindu, civilians, enraged, the, subcontinent, but, was, supported, by, some, britons, and, parts, of, the, british, media, as, a, necessary, response, gandhi, in, ahmedabad, on, the, day, after, the, massacre, in, amritsar, did, not, criticise, the, british, and, instead, criticised, his, fellow, countrymen, for, not, exclusively, using, love, to, deal, with, the, hate, of, the, british, government, gandhi, demanded, that, the, indian, people, stop, all, violence, stop, all, property, destruction, and, went, on, fast, to, death, to, pressure, indians, to, stop, their, rioting, the, massacre, and, gandhi, s, non, violent, response, to, it, moved, many, but, also, made, some, sikhs, and, hindus, upset, that, dyer, was, getting, away, with, murder, investigation, committees, were, formed, by, the, british, which, gandhi, asked, indians, to, boycott, the, unfolding, events, the, massacre, and, the, british, response, led, gandhi, to, the, belief, that, indians, will, never, get, a, fair, equal, treatment, under, british, rulers, and, he, shifted, his, attention, to, swaraj, and, political, independence, for, india, in, 1921, gandhi, was, the, leader, of, the, indian, national, congress, he, reorganised, the, congress, with, congress, now, behind, gandhi, and, muslim, support, triggered, by, his, backing, the, khilafat, movement, to, restore, the, caliph, in, turkey, gandhi, had, the, political, support, and, the, attention, of, the, british, raj, gandhi, expanded, his, nonviolent, non, co, operation, platform, to, include, the, swadeshi, policy, the, boycott, of, foreign, made, goods, especially, british, goods, linked, to, this, was, his, advocacy, that, khadi, homespun, cloth, be, worn, by, all, indians, instead, of, british, made, textiles, gandhi, exhorted, indian, men, and, women, rich, or, poor, to, spend, time, each, day, spinning, khadi, in, support, of, the, independence, movement, in, addition, to, boycotting, british, products, gandhi, urged, the, people, to, boycott, british, institutions, and, law, courts, to, resign, from, government, employment, and, to, forsake, british, titles, and, honours, gandhi, thus, began, his, journey, aimed, at, crippling, the, british, india, government, economically, politically, and, administratively, the, appeal, of, non, cooperation, grew, its, social, popularity, drew, participation, from, all, strata, of, indian, society, gandhi, was, arrested, on, 10, march, 1922, tried, for, sedition, and, sentenced, to, six, years, imprisonment, he, began, his, sentence, on, 18, march, 1922, with, gandhi, isolated, in, prison, the, indian, national, congress, split, into, two, factions, one, led, by, chitta, ranjan, das, and, motilal, nehru, favouring, party, participation, in, the, legislatures, and, the, other, led, by, chakravarti, rajagopalachari, and, sardar, vallabhbhai, patel, opposing, this, move, furthermore, co, operation, among, hindus, and, muslims, ended, as, khilafat, movement, collapsed, with, the, rise, of, atat, rk, in, turkey, muslim, leaders, left, the, congress, and, began, forming, muslim, organisations, the, political, base, behind, gandhi, had, broken, into, factions, he, was, released, in, february, 1924, for, an, appendicitis, operation, having, served, only, two, years, after, his, early, release, from, prison, for, political, crimes, in, 1924, gandhi, continued, to, pursue, swaraj, over, the, second, half, of, the, 1920s, he, pushed, through, a, resolution, at, the, calcutta, congress, in, december, 1928, calling, on, the, british, government, to, grant, india, dominion, status, or, face, a, new, campaign, of, non, cooperation, with, complete, independence, for, the, country, as, its, goal, after, gandhi, s, support, for, world, war, i, with, indian, combat, troops, and, the, failure, of, khilafat, movement, in, preserving, the, rule, of, caliph, in, turkey, followed, by, a, collapse, in, muslim, support, for, his, leadership, some, such, as, subhas, chandra, bose, and, bhagat, singh, questioned, his, values, and, non, violent, approach, while, many, hindu, leaders, championed, a, demand, for, immediate, independence, gandhi, revised, his, own, call, to, a, one, year, wait, instead, of, two, the, british, did, not, respond, favourably, to, gandhi, s, proposal, british, political, leaders, such, as, lord, birkenhead, and, winston, churchill, announced, opposition, to, the, appeasers, of, gandhi, in, their, discussions, with, european, diplomats, who, sympathised, with, indian, demands, on, 31, december, 1929, an, indian, flag, was, unfurled, in, lahore, gandhi, led, congress, in, a, celebration, on, 26, january, 1930, of, india, s, independence, day, in, lahore, this, day, was, commemorated, by, almost, every, other, indian, organisation, gandhi, then, launched, a, new, satyagraha, against, the, british, salt, tax, in, march, 1930, he, sent, an, ultimatum, in, the, form, of, a, letter, personally, addressed, to, lord, irwin, the, viceroy, of, india, on, 2, march, gandhi, condemned, british, rule, in, the, letter, describing, it, as, a, curse, that, has, impoverished, the, dumb, millions, by, a, system, of, progressive, exploitation, and, by, a, ruinously, expensive, military, and, civil, administration, it, has, reduced, us, politically, to, serfdom, gandhi, also, mentioned, in, the, letter, that, the, viceroy, received, a, salary, over, five, thousand, times, india, s, average, income, in, the, letter, gandhi, also, stressed, his, continued, adherence, to, non, violent, forms, of, protest, this, was, highlighted, by, the, salt, march, to, dandi, from, 12, march, to, 6, april, where, together, with, 78, volunteers, gandhi, marched, 388, kilometres, 241, mi, from, ahmedabad, to, dandi, gujarat, to, make, salt, himself, with, the, declared, intention, of, breaking, the, salt, laws, the, march, took, 25, days, to, cover, 240, miles, with, gandhi, speaking, to, often, huge, crowds, along, the, way, thousands, of, indians, joined, him, in, dandi, according, to, sarma, gandhi, recruited, women, to, participate, in, the, salt, tax, campaigns, and, the, boycott, of, foreign, products, which, gave, many, women, a, new, self, confidence, and, dignity, in, the, mainstream, of, indian, public, life, however, other, scholars, such, as, marilyn, french, state, that, gandhi, barred, women, from, joining, his, civil, disobedience, movement, because, gandhi, feared, he, would, be, accused, of, using, women, as, a, political, shield, when, women, insisted, on, joining, the, movement, and, participating, in, public, demonstrations, gandhi, asked, the, volunteers, to, get, permissions, of, their, guardians, and, only, those, women, who, can, arrange, child, care, should, join, him, regardless, of, gandhi, s, apprehensions, and, views, indian, women, joined, the, salt, march, by, the, thousands, to, defy, the, british, salt, taxes, and, monopoly, on, salt, mining, on, 5, may, gandhi, was, interned, under, a, regulation, dating, from, 1827, in, anticipation, of, a, protest, that, he, had, planned, the, protest, at, dharasana, salt, works, on, 21, may, went, ahead, without, gandhi, a, horrified, american, journalist, webb, miller, described, the, british, response, thus, in, complete, silence, the, gandhi, men, drew, up, and, halted, a, hundred, yards, from, the, stockade, a, picked, column, advanced, from, the, crowd, waded, the, ditches, and, approached, the, barbed, wire, stockade, at, a, word, of, command, scores, of, native, policemen, rushed, upon, the, advancing, marchers, and, rained, blows, on, their, heads, with, their, steel, shot, lathis, not, one, of, the, marchers, even, raised, an, arm, to, fend, off, blows, they, went, down, like, ninepins, from, where, i, stood, i, heard, the, sickening, whack, of, the, clubs, on, unprotected, skulls, those, struck, down, fell, sprawling, unconscious, or, writhing, with, fractured, skulls, or, broken, shoulders, this, went, on, for, hours, until, some, 300, or, more, protesters, had, been, beaten, many, seriously, injured, and, two, killed, at, no, time, did, they, offer, any, resistance, after, gandhi, s, arrest, the, women, marched, and, picketed, shops, on, their, own, accepting, violence, and, verbal, abuse, from, british, authorities, for, the, cause, in, the, manner, gandhi, inspired, this, campaign, was, one, of, gandhi, s, most, successful, at, upsetting, british, hold, on, india, britain, responded, by, imprisoning, over, 60, 000, people, however, congress, estimates, put, the, figure, at, 90, 000, among, them, was, one, of, gandhi, s, lieutenants, jawaharlal, nehru, indian, congress, in, the, 1920s, appealed, to, andhra, pradesh, peasants, by, creating, telugu, language, plays, that, combined, indian, mythology, and, legends, linked, them, to, gandhi, s, ideas, and, portrayed, gandhi, as, a, messiah, a, reincarnation, of, ancient, and, medieval, indian, nationalist, leaders, and, saints, the, plays, built, support, among, peasants, steeped, in, traditional, hindu, culture, according, to, murali, and, this, effort, made, gandhi, a, folk, hero, in, telugu, speaking, villages, a, sacred, messiah, like, figure, according, to, dennis, dalton, it, was, gandhi, s, ideas, that, were, responsible, for, his, wide, following, gandhi, criticised, western, civilisation, as, one, driven, by, brute, force, and, immorality, contrasting, it, with, his, categorisation, of, indian, civilisation, as, one, driven, by, soul, force, and, morality, gandhi, captured, the, imagination, of, the, people, of, his, heritage, with, his, ideas, about, winning, hate, with, love, these, ideas, are, evidenced, in, his, pamphlets, from, the, 1890s, in, south, africa, where, too, gandhi, was, popular, among, the, indian, indentured, workers, after, he, returned, to, india, people, flocked, to, gandhi, because, he, reflected, their, values, gandhi, also, campaigned, hard, going, from, one, rural, corner, of, the, indian, subcontinent, to, another, he, used, terminology, and, phrases, such, as, rama, rajya, from, ramayana, prahlada, as, a, paradigmatic, icon, and, such, cultural, symbols, as, another, facet, of, swaraj, and, satyagraha, during, gandhi, s, lifetime, these, ideas, sounded, strange, outside, india, but, they, readily, and, deeply, resonated, with, the, culture, and, historic, values, of, his, people, the, government, represented, by, lord, irwin, decided, to, negotiate, with, gandhi, the, gandhi, irwin, pact, was, signed, in, march, 1931, the, british, government, agreed, to, free, all, political, prisoners, in, return, for, the, suspension, of, the, civil, disobedience, movement, according, to, the, pact, gandhi, was, invited, to, attend, the, round, table, conference, in, london, for, discussions, and, as, the, sole, representative, of, the, indian, national, congress, the, conference, was, a, disappointment, to, gandhi, and, the, nationalists, gandhi, expected, to, discuss, india, s, independence, while, the, british, side, focused, on, the, indian, princes, and, indian, minorities, rather, than, on, a, transfer, of, power, lord, irwin, s, successor, lord, willingdon, took, a, hard, line, against, india, as, an, independent, nation, began, a, new, campaign, of, controlling, and, subduing, the, nationalist, movement, gandhi, was, again, arrested, and, the, government, tried, and, failed, to, negate, his, influence, by, completely, isolating, him, from, his, followers, in, britain, winston, churchill, a, prominent, conservative, politician, who, was, then, out, of, office, but, later, became, its, prime, minister, became, a, vigorous, and, articulate, critic, of, gandhi, and, opponent, of, his, long, term, plans, churchill, often, ridiculed, gandhi, saying, in, a, widely, reported, 1931, speech, it, is, alarming, and, also, nauseating, to, see, mr, gandhi, a, seditious, middle, temple, lawyer, now, posing, as, a, fakir, of, a, type, well, known, in, the, east, striding, half, naked, up, the, steps, of, the, vice, regal, palace, to, parley, on, equal, terms, with, the, representative, of, the, king, emperor, churchill, s, bitterness, against, gandhi, grew, in, the, 1930s, he, called, gandhi, as, the, one, who, was, seditious, in, aim, whose, evil, genius, and, multiform, menace, was, attacking, the, british, empire, churchill, called, him, a, dictator, a, hindu, mussolini, fomenting, a, race, war, trying, to, replace, the, raj, with, brahmin, cronies, playing, on, the, ignorance, of, indian, masses, all, for, selfish, gain, churchill, attempted, to, isolate, gandhi, and, his, criticism, of, gandhi, was, widely, covered, by, european, and, american, press, it, gained, churchill, sympathetic, support, but, it, also, increased, support, for, gandhi, among, europeans, the, developments, heightened, churchill, s, anxiety, that, the, british, themselves, would, give, up, out, of, pacifism, and, misplaced, conscience, during, the, discussions, between, gandhi, and, the, british, government, over, 1931, 32, at, the, round, table, conferences, gandhi, now, aged, about, 62, sought, constitutional, reforms, as, a, preparation, to, the, end, of, colonial, british, rule, and, begin, the, self, rule, by, indians, the, british, side, sought, reforms, that, would, keep, the, indian, subcontinent, as, a, colony, the, british, negotiators, proposed, constitutional, reforms, on, a, british, dominion, model, that, established, separate, electorates, based, on, religious, and, social, divisions, the, british, questioned, the, congress, party, and, gandhi, s, authority, to, speak, for, all, of, india, they, invited, indian, religious, leaders, such, as, muslims, and, sikhs, to, press, their, demands, along, religious, lines, as, well, as, b, r, ambedkar, as, the, representative, leader, of, the, untouchables, gandhi, vehemently, opposed, a, constitution, that, enshrined, rights, or, representations, based, on, communal, divisions, because, he, feared, that, it, would, not, bring, people, together, but, divide, them, perpetuate, their, status, and, divert, the, attention, from, india, s, struggle, to, end, the, colonial, rule, the, second, round, table, conference, was, the, only, time, gandhi, left, india, between, 1914, and, his, death, in, 1948, gandhi, declined, the, government, s, offer, of, accommodation, in, an, expensive, west, end, hotel, preferring, to, stay, in, the, east, end, to, live, among, working, class, people, as, he, did, in, india, gandhi, based, himself, in, a, small, cell, bedroom, at, kingsley, hall, for, the, three, month, duration, of, his, stay, and, was, enthusiastically, received, by, east, enders, during, this, time, gandhi, renewed, his, links, with, the, british, vegetarian, movement, after, gandhi, returned, from, the, second, round, table, conference, he, started, a, new, satyagraha, gandhi, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, at, the, yerwada, jail, pune, while, he, was, in, prison, the, british, government, enacted, a, new, law, that, granted, untouchables, a, separate, electorate, it, came, to, be, known, as, the, communal, award, in, protest, gandhi, started, a, fast, unto, death, while, he, was, held, in, prison, the, resulting, public, outcry, forced, the, government, in, consultations, with, ambedkar, to, replace, the, communal, award, with, a, compromise, poona, pact, in, 1934, gandhi, resigned, from, congress, party, membership, he, did, not, disagree, with, the, party, s, position, but, felt, that, if, he, resigned, gandhi, s, popularity, with, indians, would, cease, to, stifle, the, party, s, membership, which, actually, varied, including, communists, socialists, trade, unionists, students, religious, conservatives, and, those, with, pro, business, convictions, and, that, these, various, voices, would, get, a, chance, to, make, themselves, heard, gandhi, also, wanted, to, avoid, being, a, target, for, raj, propaganda, by, leading, a, party, that, had, temporarily, accepted, political, accommodation, with, the, raj, in, 1936, gandhi, returned, to, active, politics, again, with, the, nehru, presidency, and, the, lucknow, session, of, the, congress, although, gandhi, wanted, a, total, focus, on, the, task, of, winning, independence, and, not, speculation, about, india, s, future, he, did, not, restrain, the, congress, from, adopting, socialism, as, its, goal, gandhi, had, a, clash, with, subhas, chandra, bose, who, had, been, elected, president, in, 1938, and, who, had, previously, expressed, a, lack, of, faith, in, nonviolence, as, a, means, of, protest, despite, gandhi, s, opposition, bose, won, a, second, term, as, congress, president, against, gandhi, s, nominee, bhogaraju, pattabhi, sitaramayya, gandhi, declared, that, sitaramayya, s, defeat, was, his, defeat, bose, later, left, the, congress, when, the, all, india, leaders, resigned, en, masse, in, protest, of, his, abandonment, of, the, principles, introduced, by, gandhi, gandhi, opposed, providing, any, help, to, the, british, war, effort, and, he, campaigned, against, any, indian, participation, in, world, war, ii, the, british, government, responded, with, the, arrests, of, gandhi, and, many, other, congress, leaders, and, killed, over, 1, 000, indians, who, participated, in, this, movement, a, number, of, violent, attacks, were, also, carried, out, by, the, nationalists, against, the, british, government, while, gandhi, s, campaign, did, not, enjoy, the, support, of, a, number, of, indian, leaders, and, over, 2, 5, million, indians, volunteered, and, joined, the, british, military, to, fight, on, various, fronts, of, the, allied, forces, the, movement, played, a, role, in, weakening, the, control, over, the, south, asian, region, by, the, british, regime, and, it, ultimately, paved, the, way, for, indian, independence, gandhi, s, opposition, to, the, indian, participation, in, world, war, ii, was, motivated, by, his, belief, that, india, could, not, be, party, to, a, war, ostensibly, being, fought, for, democratic, freedom, while, that, freedom, was, denied, to, india, itself, gandhi, also, condemned, nazism, and, fascism, a, view, which, won, endorsement, of, other, indian, leaders, as, the, war, progressed, gandhi, intensified, his, demand, for, independence, calling, for, the, british, to, quit, india, in, a, 1942, speech, in, mumbai, this, was, gandhi, s, and, the, congress, party, s, most, definitive, revolt, aimed, at, securing, the, british, exit, from, india, the, british, government, responded, quickly, to, the, quit, india, speech, and, within, hours, after, gandhi, s, speech, arrested, gandhi, and, all, the, members, of, the, congress, working, committee, his, countrymen, retaliated, the, arrests, by, damaging, or, burning, down, hundreds, of, government, owned, railway, stations, police, stations, and, cutting, down, telegraph, wires, in, 1942, gandhi, now, nearing, age, 73, urged, his, people, to, completely, stop, co, operating, with, the, imperial, government, in, this, effort, gandhi, urged, that, they, neither, kill, nor, injure, british, people, but, be, willing, to, suffer, and, die, if, violence, is, initiated, by, the, british, officials, he, clarified, that, the, movement, would, not, be, stopped, because, of, any, individual, acts, of, violence, saying, that, the, ordered, anarchy, of, the, present, system, of, administration, was, worse, than, real, anarchy, gandhi, urged, indians, to, karo, ya, maro, do, or, die, in, the, cause, of, their, rights, and, freedoms, gandhi, s, arrest, lasted, two, years, as, he, was, held, in, the, aga, khan, palace, in, pune, during, this, period, gandhi, s, longtime, secretary, mahadev, desai, died, of, a, heart, attack, his, wife, kasturba, died, after, 18, months, imprisonment, on, 22, february, 1944, and, gandhi, suffered, a, severe, malaria, attack, while, in, jail, he, agreed, to, an, interview, with, stuart, gelder, a, british, journalist, gelder, then, composed, and, released, an, interview, summary, cabled, it, to, the, mainstream, press, that, announced, sudden, concessions, gandhi, was, willing, to, make, comments, that, shocked, his, countrymen, the, congress, workers, and, even, gandhi, the, latter, two, claimed, that, it, distorted, what, gandhi, actually, said, on, a, range, of, topics, and, falsely, repudiated, the, quit, india, movement, gandhi, was, released, before, the, end, of, the, war, on, 6, may, 1944, because, of, his, failing, health, and, necessary, surgery, the, raj, did, not, want, him, to, die, in, prison, and, enrage, the, nation, gandhi, came, out, of, detention, to, an, altered, political, scene, the, muslim, league, for, example, which, a, few, years, earlier, had, appeared, marginal, now, occupied, the, centre, of, the, political, stage, and, the, topic, of, jinnah, s, campaign, for, pakistan, was, a, major, talking, point, gandhi, and, jinnah, had, extensive, correspondence, and, the, two, men, met, several, times, over, a, period, of, two, weeks, in, september, 1944, at, jinnah, s, house, in, bombay, where, gandhi, insisted, on, a, united, religiously, plural, and, independent, india, which, included, muslims, and, non, muslims, of, the, indian, subcontinent, coexisting, jinnah, rejected, this, proposal, and, insisted, instead, for, partitioning, the, subcontinent, on, religious, lines, to, create, a, separate, muslim, homeland, later, pakistan, these, discussions, continued, through, 1947, while, the, leaders, of, congress, languished, in, jail, the, other, parties, supported, the, war, and, gained, organisational, strength, underground, publications, flailed, at, the, ruthless, suppression, of, congress, but, it, had, little, control, over, events, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, british, gave, clear, indications, that, power, would, be, transferred, to, indian, hands, at, this, point, gandhi, called, off, the, struggle, and, around, 100, 000, political, prisoners, were, released, including, the, congress, s, leadership, gandhi, opposed, the, partition, of, the, indian, subcontinent, along, religious, lines, the, indian, national, congress, and, gandhi, called, for, the, british, to, quit, india, however, the, all, india, muslim, league, demanded, divide, and, quit, india, gandhi, suggested, an, agreement, which, required, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, to, co, operate, and, attain, independence, under, a, provisional, government, thereafter, the, question, of, partition, could, be, resolved, by, a, plebiscite, in, the, districts, with, a, muslim, majority, jinnah, rejected, gandhi, s, proposal, and, called, for, direct, action, day, on, 16, august, 1946, to, press, muslims, to, publicly, gather, in, cities, and, support, his, proposal, for, the, partition, of, the, indian, subcontinent, into, a, muslim, state, and, non, muslim, state, huseyn, shaheed, suhrawardy, the, muslim, league, chief, minister, of, bengal, now, bangladesh, and, west, bengal, gave, calcutta, s, police, special, holiday, to, celebrate, the, direct, action, day, the, direct, action, day, triggered, a, mass, murder, of, calcutta, hindus, and, the, torching, of, their, property, and, holidaying, police, were, missing, to, contain, or, stop, the, conflict, the, british, government, did, not, order, its, army, to, move, in, to, contain, the, violence, the, violence, on, direct, action, day, led, to, retaliatory, violence, against, muslims, across, india, thousands, of, hindus, and, muslims, were, murdered, and, tens, of, thousands, were, injured, in, the, cycle, of, violence, in, the, days, that, followed, gandhi, visited, the, most, riot, prone, areas, to, appeal, a, stop, to, the, massacres, archibald, wavell, the, viceroy, and, governor, general, of, british, india, for, three, years, through, february, 1947, had, worked, with, gandhi, and, jinnah, to, find, a, common, ground, before, and, after, accepting, indian, independence, in, principle, wavell, condemned, gandhi, s, character, and, motives, as, well, as, his, ideas, wavell, accused, gandhi, of, harbouring, the, single, minded, idea, to, overthrow, british, rule, and, influence, and, to, establish, a, hindu, raj, and, called, gandhi, a, malignant, malevolent, exceedingly, shrewd, politician, wavell, feared, a, civil, war, on, the, indian, subcontinent, and, doubted, gandhi, would, be, able, to, stop, it, the, british, reluctantly, agreed, to, grant, independence, to, the, people, of, the, indian, subcontinent, but, accepted, jinnah, s, proposal, of, partitioning, the, land, into, pakistan, and, india, gandhi, was, involved, in, the, final, negotiations, but, stanley, wolpert, states, the, plan, to, carve, up, british, india, was, never, approved, of, or, accepted, by, gandhi, the, partition, was, controversial, and, violently, disputed, more, than, half, a, million, were, killed, in, religious, riots, as, 10, million, to, 12, million, non, muslims, hindus, and, sikhs, mostly, migrated, from, pakistan, into, india, and, muslims, migrated, from, india, into, pakistan, across, the,

among, his, countrymen, by, fasting, and, spinning, in, calcutta, on, 15, august, 1947, the, partition, had, gripped, the, indian, subcontinent, with, religious, violence, and, the, streets, were, filled, with, corpses, gandhi, s, fasting, and, protests, are, credited, for, stopping, the, religious, riots, and, communal, violence, at, 5, 17, p, m, on, 30, january, 1948, gandhi, was, with, his, grandnieces, in, the, garden, of, birla, house, now, gandhi, smriti, on, his, way, to, address, a, prayer, meeting, when, nathuram, godse, a, hindu, nationalist, fired, three, bullets, into, gandhi, s, chest, from, a, pistol, at, close, range, according, to, some, accounts, gandhi, died, instantly, in, other, accounts, such, as, one, prepared, by, an, eyewitness, journalist, gandhi, was, carried, into, the, birla, house, into, a, bedroom, there, he, died, about, 30, minutes, later, as, one, of, gandhi, s, family, members, read, verses, from, hindu, scriptures, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, addressed, his, countrymen, over, the, all, india, radio, saying, friends, and, comrades, the, light, has, gone, out, of, our, lives, and, there, is, darkness, everywhere, and, i, do, not, quite, know, what, to, tell, you, or, how, to, say, it, our, beloved, leader, bapu, as, we, called, him, the, father, of, the, nation, is, no, more, perhaps, i, am, wrong, to, say, that, nevertheless, we, will, not, see, him, again, as, we, have, seen, him, for, these, many, years, we, will, not, run, to, him, for, advice, or, seek, solace, from, him, and, that, is, a, terrible, blow, not, only, for, me, but, for, millions, and, millions, in, this, country, godse, a, hindu, nationalist, with, links, to, the, hindu, mahasabha, and, the, rashtriya, swayamsevak, sangh, made, no, attempt, to,

joined, the, five, mile, long, funeral, procession, that, took, over, five, hours, to, reach, raj, ghat, from, birla, house, where, gandhi, was, assassinated, and, another, million, watched, the, procession, pass, by, his, body, was, transported, on, a, weapons, carrier, whose, chassis, was, dismantled, overnight, to, allow, a, high, floor, to, be, installed, so, that, people, could, catch, a, glimpse, of, gandhi, s, body, the, engine, of, the, vehicle, was, not, used, instead, four, drag, ropes, held, by, 50, people, each, pulled, the, vehicle, all, indian, owned, establishments, in, london, remained, closed, in, mourning, as, thousands, of, people, from, all, faiths, and, denominations, and, indians, from, all, over, britain, converged, at, india, house, in, london, gandhi, was, cremated, in, accordance, with, hindu, tradition, his, ashes, were, poured, into, urns, which, were, sent, across, india, for, memorial, services, most, of, the, ashes, were, immersed, at, the, sangam, at, allahabad, on, 12, february, 1948, but, some, were, secretly, taken, away, in, 1997, tushar, gandhi, immersed, the, contents, of, one, urn, found, in, a, bank, vault, and, reclaimed, through, the, courts, at, the, sangam, at, allahabad, some, of, gandhi, s, ashes, were, scattered, at, the, source, of, the, nile, river, near, jinja, uganda, and, a, memorial, plaque, marks, the,

memorial, called, gandhi, smriti, the, place, near, yamuna, river, where, he, was, cremated, is, the, r, j, gh, t, memorial, in, new, delhi, a, black, marble, platform, it, bears, the, epigraph, h, r, ma, devanagari, or, hey, raam, these, are, said, to, be, gandhi, s, last, words, after, he, was, shot, gandhi, s, spirituality, was, greatly, based, on, his, embracement, of, the, five, great, vows, of, jainism, and, hindu, yoga, philosophy, viz, satya, truth, ahimsa, nonviolence, brahmacharya, celibacy, asteya, non, stealing, and, aparigraha, non, attachment, he, stated, that, unless, you, impose, on, yourselves, the, five, vows, you, may, not, embark, on, the, experiment, at, all, gandhi, s, statements, letters, and, life, have, attracted, much, political, and, scholarly, analysis, of, his, principles, practices, and, beliefs, including, what, influenced, him, some, writers, present, gandhi, as, a, paragon, of, ethical, living, and, pacifism, while, others, present, him, as, a, more, complex, contradictory, and, evolving, character, influenced, by, his, culture, and, circumstances, gandhi, dedicated, his, life, to, discovering, and, pursuing, truth, or, satya, and, called, his, movement, satyagraha, which, means, appeal, to, insistence, on, or, reliance, on, the, truth, the, first, formulation, of, the, satyagraha, as, a, political, movement, and, principle, occurred, in, 1920, which, gandhi, tabled, as, resolution, on, non, cooperation, in, september, that, year, before, a, session, of, the, indian, congress, it, was, the, satyagraha, formulation, and, step, states, dennis, dalton, that, deeply, resonated, with, beliefs, and, culture, of, his, people, embedded, him, into, the, popular, consciousness, transforming, him, quickly, into, mahatma, gandhi, based, satyagraha, on, the, vedantic, ideal, of, self, realisation, ahimsa, nonviolence, vegetarianism, and, universal, love, william, borman, states, that, the, key, to, his, satyagraha, is, rooted, in, the, hindu, upanishadic, texts, according, to, indira, carr, gandhi, s, ideas, on, ahimsa, and, satyagraha, were, founded, on, the, philosophical, foundations, of, advaita, vedanta, i, bruce, watson, states, that, some, of, these, ideas, are, found, not, only, in, traditions, within, hinduism, but, also, in, jainism, or, buddhism, particularly, those, about, non, violence, vegetarianism, and, universal, love, but, gandhi, s, synthesis, was, to, politicise, these, ideas, his, concept, of, satya, as, a, civil, movement, states, glyn, richards, are, best, understood, in, the, context, of, the, hindu, terminology, of, dharma, and, ta, gandhi, stated, that, the, most, important, battle, to, fight, was, overcoming, his, own, demons, fears, and, insecurities, gandhi, summarised, his, beliefs, first, when, he, said, god, is, truth, gandhi, would, later, change, this, statement, to, truth, is, god, thus, satya, truth, in, gandhi, s, philosophy, is, god, gandhi, states, richards, described, the, term, god, not, as, a, separate, power, but, as, the, being, brahman, atman, of, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, a, nondual, universal, that, pervades, in, all, things, in, each, person, and, all, life, according, to, nicholas, gier, this, to, gandhi, meant, the, unity, of, god, and, humans, that, all, beings, have, the, same, one, soul, and, therefore, equality, that, atman, exists, and, is, same, as, everything, in, the, universe, ahimsa, non, violence, is, the, very, nature, of, this, atman, the, essence, of, satyagraha, is, soul, force, as, a, political, means, refusing, to, use, brute, force, against, the, oppressor, seeking, to, eliminate, antagonisms, between, the, oppressor, and, the, oppressed, aiming, to, transform, or, purify, the, oppressor, it, is, not, inaction, but, determined, passive, resistance, and, non, co, operation, where, states, arthur, herman, love, conquers, hate, a, euphemism, sometimes, used, for, satyagraha, is, that, it, is, a, silent, force, or, a, soul, force, a, term, also, used, by, martin, luther, king, jr, during, his, i, have, a, dream, speech, it, arms, the, individual, with, moral, power, rather, than, physical, power, satyagraha, is, also, termed, a, universal, force, as, it, essentially, makes, no, distinction, between, kinsmen, and, strangers, young, and, old, man, and, woman, friend, and, foe, gandhi, wrote, there, must, be, no, impatience, no, barbarity, no, insolence, no, undue, pressure, if, we, want, to, cultivate, a, true, spirit, of, democracy, we, cannot, afford, to, be, intolerant, intolerance, betrays, want, of, faith, in, one, s, cause, civil, disobedience, and, non, co, operation, as, practised, under, satyagraha, are, based, on, the, law, of, suffering, a, doctrine, that, the, endurance, of, suffering, is, a, means, to, an, end, this, end, usually, implies, a, moral, upliftment, or, progress, of, an, individual, or, society, therefore, non, co, operation, in, satyagraha, is, in, fact, a, means, to, secure, the, co, operation, of, the, opponent, consistently, with, truth, and, justice, while, gandhi, s, idea, of, satyagraha, as, a, political, means, attracted, a, widespread, following, among, indians, the, support, was, not, universal, for, example, muslim, leaders, such, as, jinnah, opposed, the, satyagraha, idea, accused, gandhi, to, be, reviving, hinduism, through, political, activism, and, began, effort, to, counter, gandhi, with, muslim, nationalism, and, a, demand, for, muslim, homeland, the, untouchability, leader, ambedkar, in, june, 1945, after, his, decision, to, convert, to, buddhism, and, the, first, law, and, justice, minister, of, modern, india, dismissed, gandhi, s, ideas, as, loved, by, blind, hindu, devotees, primitive, influenced, by, spurious, brew, of, tolstoy, and, ruskin, and, there, is, always, some, simpleton, to, preach, them, winston, churchill, caricatured, gandhi, as, a, cunning, huckster, seeking, selfish, gain, an, aspiring, dictator, and, an, atavistic, spokesman, of, a, pagan, hinduism, churchill, stated, that, the, civil, disobedience, movement, spectacle, of, gandhi, only, increased, the, danger, to, which, white, people, there, are, exposed, although, gandhi, was, not, the, originator, of, the, principle, of, nonviolence, he, was, the, first, to, apply, it, in, the, political, field, on, a, large, scale, the, concept, of, nonviolence, ahimsa, has, a, long, history, in, indian, religious, thought, and, is, considered, the, highest, dharma, ethical, value, virtue, a, precept, to, be, observed, towards, all, living, beings, sarvbhuta, at, all, times, sarvada, in, all, respects, sarvatha, in, action, words, and, thought, gandhi, explains, his, philosophy, and,
