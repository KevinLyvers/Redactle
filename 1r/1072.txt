new, forces, to, the, egyptian, border, this, time, with, many, of, aktai, s, mamluks, among, them, baybars, and, qalawun, al, alfi, but, he, was, defeated, again, in, 1257, baybars, and, other, bahri, mamluks, left, damascus, to, jerusalem, where, they, deposed, its, governor, k, t, k, and, plundered, its, markets, then, they, did, the, same, in, gaza, later, on, they, fought, against, the, forces, of, an, nasir, yusuf, at, nablus, then, fled, to, join, the, forces, of, al, mughith, umar, in, kerak, the, combined, forces, tried, in, vain, to, invade, egypt, during, the, reign, of, aybak, baybars, then, sent, ala, al, din, taybars, al, waziri, to, discuss, with, qutuz, his, return, to, egypt, which, was, eagerly, accepted, he, was, still, a, commander, under, sultan, qutuz, at, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, in, 1260, when, he, decisively, defeated, the, mongols, after, the, battle, sultan, qutuz, aka, koetoez, was, assassinated, while, on, a, hunting, expedition, it, was, said, that, baybars, was, involved, in, the, assassination, because, he, expected, to, be, rewarded, with, the, governorship, of, aleppo, for, his, military, success, but, qutuz, fearing, his, ambition, refused, to, give, him, the, post, baybars, succeeded, qutuz, as, sultan, of, egypt, soon, after, baybars, had, ascended, to, the, sultanate, his, authority, was, confirmed, without, any, serious, resistance, except, from, alam, al, din, sinjar, al, halabi, another, mamluk, amir, who, was, popular, and, powerful, enough, to, claim, damascus, also, the, threat, from, the, mongols, was, still, serious, enough, to, be, considered, as, a, threat, to, baybars, authority, however, baybars, first, chose, to, deal, with, sinjar, and, marched, on, damascus, at, the, same, time, the, princes, of, hama, and, homs, proved, able, to, defeat, the, mongols, in, the, first, battle, of, homs, which, lifted, the, mongol, threat, for, a, while, on, 17, january, 1261, baybars, s, forces, were, able, to, rout, the, troops, of, sinjar, outside, damascus, and, pursued, the, attack, to, the, city, where, the, citizens, were, loyal, to, sinjar, and, resisted, baybars, although, their, resistance, was, soon, crushed, there, was, also, a, brief, rebellion, in, cairo, led, by, a, leading, figure, of, the, shiite, named, al, kurani, al, kurani, is, said, originated, from, nishapur, al, kurani, and, his, follower, are, recorded, to, have, attacked, the, weapon, stores, and, stables, of, cairo, during, a, night, raid, baybars, however, manage, to, suppress, the, rebellion, quickly, as, he, surrounded, and, arrested, them, all, al, kurani, and, another, rebel, leaders, were, executed, crucified, in, bab, zuweila, after, suppressing, the, revolt, of, sinjar, baybars, then, managed, to, deal, with, the, ayyubids, while, quietly, eliminating, the, prince, of, kerak, ayyubids, such, as, al, ashraf, musa, emir, of, homs, and, the, ayyubid, emir, dynasty, of, hama, al, mansur, muhammad, ii, who, had, earlier, staved, off, the, mongol, threat, were, permitted, to, continue, their, rule, in, exchange, for, their, recognizing, baybars, authority, as, sultan, after, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, iraq, was, overthrown, by, the, mongols, in, 1258, when, they, conquered, and, sacked, baghdad, the, muslim, world, lacked, a, caliph, a, theoretically, supreme, leader, who, had, sometimes, used, his, office, to, endow, distant, muslim, rulers, with, legitimacy, by, sending, them, writs, of, investiture, thus, when, the, abbasid, refugee, abu, al, qasim, ahmad, the, uncle, of, the, last, abbasid, caliph, al, musta, sim, arrived, in, cairo, in, 1261, baybars, had, him, proclaimed, caliph, as, al, mustansir, ii, and, duly, received, investiture, as, sultan, from, him, unfortunately, al, mustansir, ii, was, killed, by, the, mongols, during, an, ill, advised, expedition, to, recapture, baghdad, from, the, mongols, later, in, the, same, year, in, 1262, another, abbasid, allegedly, the, great, great, great, grandson, of, the, caliph, al, mustarshid, abu, al, abbas, ahmad, who, had, survived, from, the, defeated, expedition, was, proclaimed, caliph, as, al, hakim, i, inaugurating, the, line, of, abbasid, caliphs, of, cairo, that, continued, as, long, as, the, mamluk, sultanate, until, 1517, like, his, unfortunate, predecessor, al, hakim, i, also, received, the, formal, oath, of, allegiance, of, baybars, and, provided, him, with, legitimation, while, most, of, the, muslim, world, did, not, take, these, caliphs, seriously, as, they, were, mere, instruments, of, the, sultans, they, still, lent, a, certain, legitimation, as, well, as, a, decorative, element, to, their, rule, as, sultan, baybars, engaged, in, a, lifelong, struggle, against, the, crusader, kingdoms, in, syria, in, part, because, the, christians, had, aided, the, mongols, he, started, with, the, principality, of, antioch, which, had, become, a, vassal, state, of, the, mongols, and, had, participated, in, attacks, against, islamic, targets, in, damascus, and, syria, in, 1263, baybars, laid, siege, to, acre, the, capital, of, the, remnant, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, although, the, siege, was, abandoned, when, he, sacked, nazareth, instead, he, used, siege, engines, to, defeat, the, crusaders, in, battles, such, as, the, fall, of, arsuf, from, 21, march, to, 30, april, after, breaking, into, the, town, he, offered, free, passage, to, the, defending, knights, hospitallers, if, they, surrendered, their, formidable, citadel, the, knights, accepted, baybars, offer, but, were, enslaved, anyway, baybars, razed, the, castle, to, the, ground, he, next, attacked, atlit, and, haifa, where, he, captured, both, towns, after, destroying, the, crusaders, resistance, and, razed, the, citadels, in, the, same, year, baybars, laid, siege, to, the, fortress, of, safed, held, by, the, templar, knights, which, had, been, conquered, by, saladin, in, 1188, but, returned, to, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, in, 1240, baybars, promised, the, knights, safe, passage, to, the, christian, town, of, acre, if, they, surrendered, their, fortress, badly, outnumbered, the, knights, agreed, upon, surrender, baybars, broke, his, promise, and, massacred, the, entire, templar, garrison, on, capturing, safed, baybars, did, not, raze, the, fortress, to, the, ground, but, fortified, and, repaired, it, instead, as, it, was, strategically, situated, and, well, constructed, he, installed, a, new, governor, in, safed, with, the, rank, of, wali, later, in, 1266, baybars, invaded, the, christian, country, of, cilician, armenia, which, under, king, hethum, i, had, submitted, to, the, mongol, empire, after, defeating, the, forces, of, hethum, i, in, the, battle, of, mari, baybars, managed, to, ravage, the, three, great, cities, of, mamistra, adana, and, tarsus, so, that, when, hetoum, arrived, with, mongol, troops, the, country, was, already, devastated, hetoum, had, to, negotiate, the, return, of, his, son, leo, by, giving, control, of, armenia, s, border, fortresses, to, the, mamluks, in, 1269, hetoum, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, son, and, became, a, monk, but, he, died, a, year, later, leo, was, left, in, the, awkward, situation, of, keeping, cilicia, as, a, subject, of, the, mongol, empire, while, at, the, same, time, paying, tribute, to, the, mamluks, this, isolated, antioch, and, tripoli, led, by, hethum, s, son, in, law, prince, bohemond, vi, after, successfully, conquering, cilicila, baybars, in, 1267, settled, his, unfinished, business, with, acre, and, continued, the, extermination, of, remaining, crusader, garrisons, in, the, following, years, in, 1268, he, besieged, antioch, capturing, the, city, on, 18, may, baybars, had, promised, to, spare, the, lives, of, the, inhabitants, but, he, broke, his, promise, and, had, the, city, razed, killing, or, enslaving, much, of, the, population, after, the, surrender, prompting, the, fall, of, the, principality, of, antioch, the, massacre, of, men, women, and, children, at, antioch, was, the, single, greatest, massacre, of, the, entire, crusading, era, priests, had, their, throats, slit, inside, their, churches, and, women, were, sold, into, slavery, then, he, continued, to, jaffa, which, belonged, to, guy, the, son, of, john, of, ibelin, jaffa, fell, to, baybars, on, 7, march, after, twelve, hours, of, fighting, most, of, jaffa, s, citizens, were, slain, but, baybars, allowed, the, garrison, to, go, unharmed, after, this, he, conquered, ashkalon, and, caesarea, baybars, actively, pursued, a, close, relationship, with, berke, the, khan, of, golden, horde, he, particularly, was, recorded, to, receive, the, first, two, hundred, soldiers, from, golden, horde, to, visit, warmly, where, baybars, persuade, them, to, convert, to, islam, while, also, observing, the, growing, enmity, between, the, golden, horde, khan, with, hulagu, baybars, who, at, that, time, has, just, defeated, hulagu, immediately, sent, envoy, to, berke, to, inform, the, latter, about, this, then, as, soon, as, berke, converted, to, islam, he, sent, envoy, to, egypt, to, give, news, about, this, matter, and, later, baybars, brought, more, peoples, from, golden, horde, to, be, sent, into, egypt, where, they, also, converted, into, islam, in, some, time, around, october, to, november, 1267, or, about, 666, safar, of, hijra, year, baybars, wrote, condolences, and, congratulations, to, the, new, khan, of, the, golden, horde, mengu, timur, to, urge, him, to, fight, abaqa, baybars, continued, to, conduct, warm, correspondence, with, the, golden, horde, particularly, with, mengu, timur, s, general, noqai, who, unlike, mengu, timur, was, very, cooperative, with, baybars, it, is, theorized, that, this, intimacy, was, not, only, due, to, the, religious, connection, as, noqai, was, a, muslim, unlike, his, khan, but, also, because, noqai, was, not, really, fond, of, mengu, timur, however, baybars, was, pragmatic, in, his, approach, and, did, not, want, to, become, involved, in, complicated, intrigue, inside, the, golden, horde, so, instead, he, stayed, close, to, both, mengu, timur, and, noqai, on, 30, march, 1271, after, baybars, captured, the, smaller, castles, in, the, area, including, chastel, blanc, he, besieged, the, krak, des, chevaliers, held, by, the, hospitallers, peasants, who, lived, in, the, area, had, fled, to, the, castle, for, safety, and, were, kept, in, the, outer, ward, as, soon, as, baybars, arrived, he, began, erecting, mangonels, powerful, siege, weapons, which, he, would, turn, on, the, castle, according, to, ibn, shaddad, two, days, later, the, first, line, of, defences, was, captured, by, the, besiegers, he, was, probably, referring, to, a, walled, suburb, outside, the, castle, s, entrance, after, a, lull, of, ten, days, the, besiegers, conveyed, a, letter, to, the, garrison, supposedly, from, the, grand, master, of, the, knights, hospitaller, in, tripoli, hugues, de, revel, which, granted, permission, for, them, to, surrender, the, garrison, capitulated, and, the, sultan, spared, their, lives, the, new, owners, of, the, castle, undertook, repairs, focused, mainly, on, the, outer, ward, the, hospitaller, chapel, was, converted, to, a, mosque, and, two, mihrabs, were, added, to, the, interior, baybars, then, turned, his, attention, to, tripoli, but, he, interrupted, his, siege, there, to, call, a, truce, in, may, 1271, the, fall, of, antioch, had, led, to, the, brief, ninth, crusade, led, by, prince, edward, of, england, who, arrived, in, acre, in, may, 1271, and, attempted, to, ally, himself, with, the, mongols, against, baybars, so, baybars, declared, a, truce, with, tripoli, as, well, as, with, edward, who, was, never, able, to, capture, any, territory, from, baybars, anyway, according, to, some, reports, baybars, tried, to, have, edward, assassinated, with, poison, but, edward, survived, the, attempt, and, returned, home, in, 1272, in, 1265, a, mamluk, army, allegedly, raided, makuria, as, far, south, as, dongola, while, also, expanding, southwards, along, the, african, red, sea, coast, thus, threatening, the, nubians, in, 1272, king, david, marched, east, and, attacked, the, port, town, of, aidhab, located, on, an, important, pilgrimage, route, to, mecca, the, nubian, army, destroyed, the, town, causing, a, blow, to, the, very, heart, of, islam, this, initiated, several, decades, of, intervention, by, the, mamluks, in, nubian, affairs, a, punitive, mamluk, expedition, was, sent, in, response, but, did, not, pass, beyond, the, second, cataract, three, years, later, the, makurians, attacked, and, destroyed, aswan, but, this, time, baybars, responded, with, a, well, equipped, army, setting, off, from, cairo, in, early, 1276, accompanied, by, a, cousin, of, king, david, named, mashkouda, or, shekanda, the, mamluks, defeated, the, nubians, in, three, battles, at, gebel, adda, meinarti, and, finally, at, the, battle, of, dongola, david, fled, upstream, the, nile, eventually, entering, al, abwab, in, the, south, which, previously, being, alodia, s, northernmost, province, had, by, this, period, become, a, kingdom, of, its, own, the, king, of, al, abwab, however, handed, david, over, to, baybars, who, had, him, executed, baybars, then, completed, his, conquest, of, nubia, including, the, medieval, lower, nubia, which, was, ruled, by, banu, kanz, under, the, terms, of, the, settlement, the, nubians, were, now, subjected, to, paying, jizya, tribute, and, in, return, they, were, allowed, to, keep, their, religion, being, protected, under, islamic, law, as, people, of, the, book, they, were, also, allowed, to, continue, being, governed, by, a, king, from, the, native, royal, family, although, this, king, was, chosen, personally, by, baybars, namely, a, makurian, noble, named, shakanda, in, practice, this, was, reducing, makuria, to, a, vassal, kingdom, effectively, ending, makuria, s, status, as, an, independent, kingdom, in, 1277, baybars, invaded, the, seljuq, sultanate, of, r, m, then, controlled, by, the, ilkhanate, mongols, he, defeated, a, ilkhanate, army, at, the, battle, of, elbistan, and, captured, the, city, of, kayseri, baybars, himself, went, with, a, few, troops, to, deal, with, the, mongol, right, flank, that, was, pounding, his, left, wing, baybars, ordered, a, force, from, the, army, from, hama, to, reinforce, his, left, the, large, mamluk, numbers, were, able, to, overwhelm, the, mongol, force, who, instead, of, retreating, dismounted, from, their, horses, some, mongols, were, able, to, escape, and, took, up, positions, on, the, hills, once, they, became, surrounded, they, once, again, dismounted, and, fought, to, the, death, during, the, celebration, of, victory, baybars, said, that, how, can, i, be, happy, before, i, had, thought, that, i, and, my, servants, would, defeat, the, mongols, but, my, left, wing, was, beaten, by, them, only, allah, helped, us, the, possibility, of, a, new, mongol, army, convinced, baybars, to, return, to, syria, since, he, was, far, away, from, his, bases, and, supply, line, as, the, mamluk, army, returned, to, syria, the, commander, of, the, mamluk, vanguard, izz, al, din, aybeg, al, shaykhi, deserted, to, the, mongols, perv, ne, sent, a, letter, to, baybars, asking, him, to, delay, his, departure, baybars, chastised, him, for, not, aiding, him, during, the, battle, of, elbistan, baybars, told, him, he, was, leaving, for, sivas, to, mislead, perv, ne, and, the, mongols, as, to, his, true, destination, baybars, also, sent, taybars, al, waziri, with, a, force, to, raid, the, armenian, town, of, al, rummana, whose, inhabitants, had, hidden, the, mongols, earlier, baybars, died, in, damascus, on, 1, july, 1277, when, he, was, 53, years, old, his, demise, has, been, the, subject, of, some, academic, speculation, many, sources, agree, that, he, died, from, drinking, poisoned, kumis, that, was, intended, for, someone, else, other, accounts, suggest, that, he, may, have, died, from, a,
