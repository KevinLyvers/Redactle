smoking, and, drinking, it, was, in, this, cultic, milieu, that, narendra, became, acquainted, with, western, esotericism, his, initial, beliefs, were, shaped, by, brahmo, concepts, which, denounced, polytheism, and, caste, restrictions, and, a, streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic, theology, strongly, coloured, by, a, selective, and, modernistic, reading, of, the, upanisads, and, of, the, vedanta, rammohan, roy, the, founder, of, the, brahmo, samaj, who, was, strongly, influenced, by, unitarianism, strove, towards, a, universalistic, interpretation, of, hinduism, his, ideas, were, altered, considerably, by, debendranath, tagore, who, had, a, romantic, approach, to, the, development, of, these, new, doctrines, and, questioned, central, hindu, beliefs, like, reincarnation, and, karma, and, rejected, the, authority, of, the, vedas, tagore, also, brought, this, neo, hinduism, closer, in, line, with, western, esotericism, a, development, which, was, furthered, by, sen, sen, was, influenced, by, transcendentalism, an, american, philosophical, religious, movement, strongly, connected, with, unitarianism, which, emphasised, personal, religious, experience, over, mere, reasoning, and, theology, sen, strived, to, an, accessible, non, renunciatory, everyman, type, of, spirituality, introducing, lay, systems, of, spiritual, practice, which, can, be, regarded, as, an, influence, to, the, teachings, vivekananda, later, popularised, in, the, west, not, satisfied, with, his, knowledge, of, philosophy, narendra, came, to, the, question, which, marked, the, real, beginning, of, his, intellectual, quest, for, god, he, asked, several, prominent, calcutta, residents, if, they, had, come, face, to, face, with, god, but, none, of, their, answers, satisfied, him, at, this, time, narendra, met, debendranath, tagore, the, leader, of, brahmo, samaj, and, asked, if, he, had, seen, god, instead, of, answering, his, question, tagore, said, my, boy, you, have, the, yogi, s, eyes, according, to, banhatti, it, was, ramakrishna, who, really, answered, narendra, s, question, by, saying, yes, i, see, him, as, i, see, you, only, in, an, infinitely, intenser, sense, according, to, de, michelis, vivekananda, was, more, influenced, by, the, brahmo, samaj, s, and, its, new, ideas, than, by, ramakrishna, swami, medhananda, agrees, that, the, brahmo, samaj, was, a, formative, influence, but, that, it, was, narendra, s, momentous, encounter, with, ramakrishna, that, changed, the, course, of, his, life, by, turning, him, away, from, brahmoism, according, to, de, michelis, it, was, sen, s, influence, which, brought, vivekananda, fully, into, contact, with, western, esotericism, and, it, was, also, via, sen, that, he, met, ramakrishna, in, 1881, narendra, first, met, ramakrishna, who, became, his, spiritual, focus, after, his, own, father, had, died, in, 1884, narendra, s, first, introduction, to, ramakrishna, occurred, in, a, literature, class, at, general, assembly, s, institution, when, he, heard, professor, william, hastie, lecturing, on, william, wordsworth, s, poem, the, excursion, while, explaining, the, word, trance, in, the, poem, hastie, suggested, that, his, students, visit, ramakrishna, of, dakshineswar, to, understand, the, true, meaning, of, trance, this, prompted, some, of, his, students, including, narendra, to, visit, ramakrishna, they, probably, first, met, personally, in, november, 1881, though, narendra, did, not, consider, this, their, first, meeting, and, neither, man, mentioned, this, meeting, later, at, this, time, narendra, was, preparing, for, his, upcoming, f, a, examination, when, ram, chandra, datta, accompanied, him, to, surendra, nath, mitra, s, house, where, ramakrishna, was, invited, to,

he, did, not, initially, accept, ramakrishna, as, his, teacher, and, rebelled, against, his, ideas, he, was, attracted, by, his, personality, and, began, to, frequently, visit, him, at, dakshineswar, he, initially, saw, ramakrishna, s, ecstasies, and, visions, as, mere, figments, of, imagination, and, hallucinations, as, a, member, of, brahmo, samaj, he, opposed, idol, worship, polytheism, and, ramakrishna, s, worship, of, kali, he, even, rejected, the, advaita, vedanta, of, identity, with, the, absolute, as, blasphemy, and, madness, and, often, ridiculed, the, idea, narendra, tested, ramakrishna, who, faced, his, arguments, patiently, try, to, see, the, truth, from, all, angles, he, replied, narendra, s, father, s, sudden, death, in, 1884, left, the, family, bankrupt, creditors,

increased, one, day, narendra, requested, ramakrishna, to, pray, to, goddess, kali, for, their, family, s, financial, welfare, ramakrishna, instead, suggested, him, to, go, to, the, temple, himself, and, pray, following, ramakrishna, s, suggestion, he, went, to, the, temple, thrice, but, failed, to, pray, for, any, kind, of, worldly, necessities, and, ultimately, prayed, for, true, knowledge,
