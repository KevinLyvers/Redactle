intellectual, brilliance, of, the, james, family, milieu, and, the, remarkable, epistolary, talents, of, several, of, its, members, have, made, them, a, subject, of, continuing, interest, to,

during, his, life, james, wished, to, pursue, painting, his, early, artistic, bent, led, to, an, apprenticeship, in, the, studio, of, william, morris, hunt, in, newport, rhode, island, but, his, father, urged, him, to, become, a, physician, instead, since, this, did, not, align, with, james, s, interests, he, stated, that, he, wanted, to, specialize, in, physiology, once, he, figured, this, was, also, not, what, he, wanted, to, do, he, then, announced, he, was, going, to, specialize, in, the, nervous, system, and, psychology, james, then, switched, in, 1861, to, scientific, studies, at,

other, three, siblings, william, henry, and, alice, james, all, suffered, from, periods, of, invalidism, he, took, up, medical, studies, at, harvard, medical, school, in, 1864, according, to, his, brother, henry, james, the, author, he, took, a, break, in, the, spring, of, 1865, to, join, naturalist, louis, agassiz, on, a, scientific, expedition, up, the, amazon, river, but, aborted, his, trip, after, eight, months, as, he, suffered, bouts, of, severe, seasickness, and, mild, smallpox, his, studies, were, interrupted, once, again, due, to, illness, in, april, 1867, he, traveled, to, germany,

literary, periodicals, such, as, the, north, american, review, james, finally, earned, his, md, degree, in, june, 1869, but, he, never, practiced, medicine, what, he, called, his, soul, sickness, would, only, be, resolved, in, 1872, after, an, extended, period, of, philosophical, searching, he, married, alice, gibbens, in, 1878, in, 1882, he, joined, the, theosophical, society, james, s, time, in, germany, proved, intellectually, fertile, helping, him, find, that, his, true, interests, lay, not, in, medicine, but, in, philosophy, and, psychology, later, in, 1902, he, would, write, i, originally, studied, medicine, in, order, to, be, a, physiologist, but, i, drifted, into, psychology, and, philosophy, from, a, sort, of, fatality, i, never, had, any, philosophic, instruction, the, first, lecture, on, psychology, i, ever, heard, being, the, first, i, ever, gave, he, interacted, with, a, wide, array, of, writers, and, scholars, throughout, his, life, including, his, godfather, ralph, waldo, emerson, his, godson, william, james, sidis, as, well, as, charles, sanders, peirce, bertrand, russell, josiah, royce, ernst, mach, john, dewey, macedonio, fern, ndez, walter, lippmann,

and, biology, and, began, to, teach, in, those, subjects, but, was, drawn, to, the, scientific, study, of, the, human, mind, at, a, time, when, psychology, was, constituting, itself, as, a, science, james, s, acquaintance, with, the, work, of, figures, like, hermann, helmholtz, in, germany, and, pierre, janet, in, france, facilitated, his, introduction, of, courses, in, scientific, psychology, at, harvard, university, he, taught, his, first, experimental, psychology, course, at, harvard, in, the, 1875, 1876, academic, year, during, his, harvard, years, james, joined, in, philosophical, discussions, and, debates, with, charles, peirce, oliver, wendell, holmes, and, chauncey, wright, that, evolved, into, a, lively, group, informally, known, as, the, metaphysical, club, in, 1872, louis, menand, 2001, suggested, that, this, club, provided, a, foundation, for, american, intellectual, thought, for, decades, to, come, james, joined, the, anti, imperialist, league, in, 1898, in, opposition, to, the, united, states, annexation, of, the, philippines, among, james, s, students, at, harvard, university, were, boris, sidis, theodore, roosevelt, george, santayana, w, e, b, du,

him, for, his, kindness, and, humble, attitude, his, respectful, attitude, towards, them, speaks, well, of, his, character, following, his, january, 1907, retirement, from, harvard, james, continued, to, write, and, lecture, publishing, pragmatism, a, pluralistic, universe, and, the, meaning, of, truth, james, was, increasingly, afflicted, with, cardiac, pain, during, his, last, years, it, worsened, in, 1909, while, he, worked, on, a, philosophy, text, unfinished, but, posthumously, published, as, some, problems, in, philosophy, james, sailed, to, europe, in, the, spring, of, 1910, to, take, experimental, treatments, for, his, heart, ailment, that, proved, unsuccessful, and, returned, home, on, august, 18, his, heart, failed, on, august, 26, 1910, at, his, home, in, chocorua, new,

and, of, pragmatism, in, philosophy, he, was, a, founder, of, the, american, society, for, psychical, research, as, well, as, a, champion, of, alternative, approaches, to, healing, in, 1884, and, 1885, he, became, president, of, the, british, society, for, psychical, research, for, which, he, wrote, in, mind, and, in, the, psychological, review, he, challenged, his, professional, colleagues, not, to, let, a, narrow, mindset, prevent, an, honest, appraisal, of, those, beliefs, in, an, empirical, study, by, haggbloom, et, al, using, six, criteria, such, as, citations, and, recognition, james, was, found, to, be, the, 14th, most, eminent, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, william, james, was, the, son, of, henry, james, senior, of, albany, and, mary, robertson, walsh, he, had,

s, ancestors, arrived, in, america, from, scotland, or, ireland, in, the, 18th, century, many, of, them, settled, in, eastern, new, york, or, new, jersey, all, of, james, s, ancestors, were, protestant, well, educated, and, of, character, within, their, communities, they, worked, as, farmers, merchants, and, traders, who, were, all, heavily, involved, with, their, church, the, last, ancestor, to, arrive, in, america, was, william, james, s, paternal, grandfather, also, named, william, james, he, came, to, america, from, ballyjamesduff, county, cavan, ireland, in, 1789, when, he, was, 18, years, old, there, is, suspicion, that, he, fled, to, america, because, his, family, tried, to, force, him, into, the, ministry, after, traveling, to, america, with, no, money, left, he, found, a, job, at, a, store, as, a, clerk, after, continuously, working, he, was, able, to, own, the, store, himself, as, he, traveled, west, to, find, more, job, opportunities, he, was, involved, in, various, jobs, such, as, the, salt, industry, and, the, erie, canal, project, after, being, a, significant, worker, in, the, erie, canal, project, and, helping, albany, become, a, major, center, of, trade, he, then, became, the, first, vice, president, of, the, albany, savings, bank, william, james, grandfather, went, from, being, a, poor, irish, immigrant, to, one, of, the, richest, men, in, new, york, after, his, death, his, son, henry, james, inherited, his, fortune, and, lived, in, europe, and, the, united, states, searching, for, the, meaning, of, life, of, james, five, children, two, margaret, and, alexander, are, known, to, have, had, children, descendants, of, alexander, are, still, living, william, james, wrote, voluminously, throughout, his, life, a, non, exhaustive, bibliography, of, his, writings, compiled, by, john, mcdermott, is, 47, pages, long, he, gained, widespread, recognition, with, his, monumental, the, principles, of, psychology, 1890, totaling, twelve, hundred, pages, in, two, volumes, which, took, twelve, years, to, complete, psychology, the, briefer, course, was, an, 1892, abridgement, designed, as, a, less, rigorous, introduction, to, the, field, these, works, criticized, both, the, english, associationist, school, and, the, hegelianism, of, his, day, as, competing, dogmatisms, of, little, explanatory, value, and, sought, to, re, conceive, the, human, mind, as, inherently, purposive, and, selective, president, jimmy, carter, s, moral, equivalent, of, war, speech, on, april, 17, 1977, equating, the, united, states, 1970s, energy, crisis, oil, crisis, and, the, changes, and, sacrifices, carter, s, proposed, plans, would, require, with, the, moral, equivalent, of, war, may, have, borrowed, its, title, and, much, of, its, theme, from, james, s, classic, essay, the, moral, equivalent, of, war, derived, from, his, last, speech, delivered, at, stanford, university, in, 1906, and, published, in, 1910, in, which, james, considered, one, of, the, classic, problems, of, politics, how, to, sustain, political, unity, and, civic, virtue, in, the, absence, of, war, or, a, credible, threat, and, which, sounds, a, rallying, cry, for, service, in, the, interests, of, the, individual, and, the, nation, in, simple, terms, his, philosophy, and, writings, can, be, understood, as, an, emphasis, on, fruits, over, roots, a, reflection, of, his, pragmatist, tendency, to, focus, on, the, practical, consequences, of, ideas, rather, than, become, mired, in, unproductive, metaphysical, arguments, or, fruitless, attempts, to, ground, truth, in, abstract, ways, ever, the, empiricist, james, believes, we, are, better, off, evaluating, the, fruitfulness, of, ideas, by, testing, them, in, the, common, ground, of, lived, experience, james, was, remembered, as, one, of, america, s, representative, thinkers, psychologist, and, philosopher, william, james, was, also, an, influential, writer, on, religion, psychical, research, and, self, help, james, defined, true, beliefs, as, those, that, prove, useful, to, the, believer, his, pragmatic, theory, of, truth, was, a, synthesis, of, correspondence, theory, of, truth, and, coherence, theory, of, truth, with, an, added, dimension, truth, is, verifiable, to, the, extent, that, thoughts, and, statements, correspond, with, actual, things, as, well, as, the, extent, to, which, they, hang, together, or, cohere, as, pieces, of, a, puzzle, might, fit, together, these, are, in, turn, verified, by, the, observed, results, of, the, application, of, an, idea, to, actual, practice, the, most, ancient, parts, of, truth, also, once, were, plastic, they, also, were, called, true, for, human, reasons, they, also, mediated, between, still, earlier, truths, and, what, in, those, days, were, novel, observations, purely, objective, truth, truth, in, whose, establishment, the, function, of, giving, human, satisfaction, in, marrying, previous, parts, of, experience, with, newer, parts, played, no, role, whatsoever, is, nowhere, to, be, found, the, reasons, why, we, call, things, true, is, the, reason, why, they, are, true, for, to, be, true, means, only, to, perform, this, marriage, function, james, held, a, world, view, in, line, with, pragmatism, declaring, that, the, value, of, any, truth, was, utterly, dependent, upon, its, use, to, the, person, who, held, it, additional, tenets, of, james, s, pragmatism, include, the, view, that, the, world, is, a, mosaic, of, diverse, experiences, that, can, only, be, properly, interpreted, and, understood, through, an, application, of, radical, empiricism, radical, empiricism, not, related, to, the, everyday, scientific, empiricism, asserts, that, the, world, and, experience, can, never, be, halted, for, an, entirely, objective, analysis, the, mind, of, the, observer, and, the, act, of, observation, affect, any, empirical, approach, to, truth, the, mind, its, experiences, and, nature, are, inseparable, james, s, emphasis, on, diversity, as, the, default, human, condition, over, and, against, duality, especially, hegelian, dialectical, duality, has, maintained, a, strong, influence, in, american, culture, james, s, description, of, the, mind, world, connection, which, he, described, in, terms, of, a, stream, of, consciousness, had, a, direct, and, significant, impact, on, avant, garde, and, modernist, literature, and, art, notably, in, the, case, of, james, joyce, in, what, pragmatism, means, 1906, james, writes, that, the, central, point, of, his, own, doctrine, of, truth, is, in, brief, truths, emerge, from, facts, but, they, dip, forward, into, facts, again, and, add, to, them, which, facts, again, create, or, reveal, new, truth, the, word, is, indifferent, and, so, on, indefinitely, the, facts, themselves, meanwhile, are, not, true, they, simply, are, truth, is, the, function, of, the, beliefs, that, start, and, terminate, among, them, richard, rorty, made, the, contested, claim, that, james, did, not, mean, to, give, a, theory, of, truth, with, this, statement, and, that, we, should, not, regard, it, as, such, however, other, pragmatism, scholars, such, as, susan, haack, and, howard, mounce, do, not, share, rorty, s, instrumentalist, interpretation, of, james, in, the, meaning, of, truth, 1909, james, seems, to, speak, of, truth, in, relativistic, terms, in, reference, to, critics, of, pragmatism, the, critic, s, trouble, seems, to, come, from, his, taking, the, word, true, irrelatively, whereas, the, pragmatist, always, means, true, for, him, who, experiences, the, workings, however, james, responded, to, critics, accusing, him, of, relativism, skepticism, or, agnosticism, and, of, believing, only, in, relative, truths, to, the, contrary, he, supported, an, epistemological, realism, position, pragmatism, is, a, philosophical, approach, that, seeks, to, both, define, truth, and, resolve, metaphysical, issues, william, james, demonstrates, an, application, of, his, method, in, the, form, of, a, simple, story, a, live, squirrel, supposed, to, be, clinging, on, one, side, of, a, tree, trunk, while, over, against, the, tree, s, opposite, side, a, human, being, was, imagined, to, stand, this, human, witness, tries, to, get, sight, of, the, squirrel, by, moving, rapidly, round, the, tree, but, no, matter, how, fast, he, goes, the, squirrel, moves, as, fast, in, the, opposite, direction, and, always, keeps, the, tree, between, himself, and, the, man, so, that, never, a, glimpse, of, him, is, caught, the, resultant, metaphysical, problem, now, is, this, does, the, man, go, round, the, squirrel, or, not, james, solves, the, issue, by, making, a, distinction, between, practical, meaning, that, is, the, distinction, between, meanings, of, round, round, in, the, sense, that, the, man, occupies, the, space, north, east, south, and, west, of, the, squirrel, and, round, in, the, sense, that, the, man, occupies, the, space, facing, the, squirrel, s, belly, back, and, sides, depending, on, what, the, debaters, meant, by, going, round, the, answer, would, be, clear, from, this, example, james, derives, the, definition, of, the, pragmatic, method, to, settle, metaphysical, disputes, one, must, simply, make, a, distinction, of, practical, consequences, between, notions, then, the, answer, is, either, clear, or, the, dispute, is, idle, both, james, and, his, colleague, charles, sanders, peirce, coined, the, term, cash, value, when, he, said, that, the, whole, meaning, of, a, clear, conception, consists, in, the, entire, set, of, its, practical, consequences, he, had, in, mind, that, a, meaningful, conception, must, have, some, sort, of, experiential, cash, value, must, somehow, be, capable, of, being, related, to, some, sort, of, collection, of, possible, empirical, observations, under, specifiable, conditions, a, statement, s, truthfulness, is, verifiable, through, its, correspondence, to, reality, and, its, observable, effects, of, putting, the, idea, to, practice, for, example, james, extends, his, pragmatism, to, the, hypothesis, of, god, on, pragmatic, principles, if, the, hypothesis, of, god, works, satisfactorily, in, the, widest, sense, of, the, word, it, is, true, the, problem, is, to, build, it, out, and, determine, it, so, that, it, will, combine, satisfactorily, with, all, the, other, working, truths, from, this, we, also, know, that, new, truths, must, also, correspond, to, already, existent, truths, as, well, from, the, introduction, by, bruce, kuklick, 1981, p, xiv, to, james, s, pragmatism, james, went, on, to, apply, the, pragmatic, method, to, the, epistemological, problem, of, truth, he, would, seek, the, meaning, of, true, by, examining, how, the, idea, functioned, in, our, lives, a, belief, was, true, he, said, if, it, worked, for, all, of, us, and, guided, us, expeditiously, through, our, semihospitable, world, james, was, anxious, to, uncover, what, true, beliefs, amounted, to, in, human, life, what, their, cash, value, was, and, what, consequences, they, led, to, a, belief, was, not, a, mental, entity, which, somehow, mysteriously, corresponded, to, an, external, reality, if, the, belief, were, true, beliefs, were, ways, of, acting, with, reference, to, a, precarious, environment, and, to, say, they, were, true, was, to, say, they, were, efficacious, in, this, environment, in, this, sense, the, pragmatic, theory, of, truth, applied, darwinian, ideas, in, philosophy, it, made, survival, the, test, of, intellectual, as, well, as, biological, fitness, james, s, book, of, lectures, on, pragmatism, is, arguably, the, most, influential, book, of, american, philosophy, the, lectures, inside, depict, his, position, on, the, subject, in, his, sixth, lecture, he, begins, by, defining, truth, as, agreement, with, reality, with, this, james, warns, that, there, will, be, disagreements, between, pragmatics, and, intellectualists, over, the, concepts, of, agreement, and, reality, the, last, reasoning, before, thoughts, settle, and, become, autonomous, for, us, however, he, contrasts, this, by, supporting, a, more, practical, interpretation, that, a, true, idea, or, belief, is, one, that, we, can, blend, with, our, thinking, so, that, it, can, be, justified, through, experiences, if, theological, ideas, prove, to, have, a, value, for, concrete, life, they, will, be, true, for, pragmatism, in, the, sense, of, being, good, for, so, much, for, how, much, more, they, are, true, will, depend, entirely, on, their, relations, to, the, other, truths, that, also, have, to, be, acknowledged, whereby, the, agreement, of, truths, with, reality, results, in, useful, outcomes, the, reality, with, which, truths, must, agree, has, three, dimensions, according, to, james, s, pragmatic, approach, to, belief, knowledge, is, commonly, viewed, as, a, justified, and, true, belief, james, will, accept, a, view, if, its, conception, of, truth, is, analyzed, and, justified, through, interpretation, pragmatically, as, a, matter, of, fact, james, s, whole, philosophy, is, of, productive, beliefs, belief, in, anything, involves, conceiving, of, how, it, is, real, but, disbelief, is, the, result, when, we, dismiss, something, because, it, contradicts, another, thing, we, think, of, as, real, in, his, sentiment, of, rationality, saying, that, crucial, beliefs, are, not, known, is, to, doubt, their, truth, even, if, it, seems, possible, james, names, four, postulates, of, rationality, as, valuable, but, unknowable, god, immorality, freedom, and, moral, duty, in, contrast, the, weak, side, to, pragmatism, is, that, the, best, justification, for, a, claim, is, whether, it, works, however, a, claim, that, does, not, have, outcomes, cannot, be, justified, or, unjustified, because, it, will, not, make, a, difference, there, can, be, no, difference, that, doesn, t, make, a, difference, when, james, moves, on, to, then, state, that, pragmatism, s, goal, is, ultimately, to, try, to, interpret, each, notion, by, tracing, its, respective, practical, consequences, he, does, not, clarify, what, he, means, by, practical, consequences, on, the, other, hand, his, friend, colleague, and, another, key, founder, in, establishing, pragmatist, beliefs, charles, s, peirce, dives, deeper, in, defining, these, consequences, for, peirce, the, consequences, we, are, concerned, with, are, general, and, intelligible, he, further, explains, this, in, his, 1878, paper, how, to, make, ideas, clear, when, he, introduces, a, maxim, that, allows, one, to, interpret, consequences, as, grades, of, clarity, and, conception, describing, how, everything, is, derived, from, perception, peirce, uses, the, example, of, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, to, show, exactly, how, he, defines, practical, consequences, protestants, interpret, the, bread, and, wine, of, the, eucharist, is, flesh, and, blood, in, only, a, subjective, sense, while, catholics, would, label, them, as, actual, and, divinely, mystical, properties, of, flesh, via, the, body, blood, soul, and, divinity, even, with, the, physical, properties, remaining, as, bread, and, wine, in, appearance, but, to, everyone, there, can, be, no, knowledge, of, the, wine, and, bread, of, the, eucharist, unless, it, is, established, that, either, wine, and, bread, possesses, certain, properties, or, that, anything, that, is, interpreted, as, the, blood, and, body, of, christ, is, the, blood, and, body, of, christ, with, this, peirce, declares, that, our, action, has, exclusive, reference, to, what, affects, the, senses, and, that, we, can, mean, nothing, by, transubstantiation, than, what, has, certain, effects, direct, or, indirect, upon, our, senses, in, this, sense, james, s, pragmatic, influencer, peirce, establishes, that, what, counts, as, a, practical, consequence, or, effect, is, what, can, affect, one, s, senses, and, what, is, comprehensible, and, fathomable, in, the, natural, world, yet, james, never, worked, out, his, understanding, of, practical, consequences, as, fully, as, peirce, did, nor, does, he, limit, these, consequences, to, the, senses, as, peirce, does, this, raises, the, question, what, does, it, mean, to, be, practical, whether, james, means, the, greatest, number, of, positive, consequences, in, light, of, utilitarianism, a, consequence, that, considers, other, perspectives, such, as, his, compromise, of, the, tender, and, tough, ways, of, thinking, or, a, completely, different, take, altogether, it, is, unclear, what, consequences, truly, fit, the, pragmatic, standard, the, closest, james, comes, to, explaining, this, idea, is, by, telling, his, audience, to, weigh, the, difference, it, would, practically, make, to, anyone, if, one, opinion, over, the, other, were, true, and, although, he, attempts, to, clarify, this, he, never, specifies, the, method, by, which, one, would, weigh, the, difference, between, one, opinion, over, the, other, thus, the, flaw, in, his, argument, appears, in, that, it, is, difficult, to, fathom, how, he, would, determine, these, practical, consequences, which, he, continually, refers, to, throughout, his, work, to, be, measured, or, interpreted, he, has, said, that, an, opinion, is, correct, that, works, for, us, humans, in, practice, in, william, james, s, 1896, lecture, titled, the, will, to, believe, james, defends, the, right, to, violate, the, principle, of, evidentialism, in, order, to, justify, hypothesis, venturing, this, idea, foresaw, 20th, century, objections, to, evidentialism, and, sought, to, ground, justified, belief, in, an, unwavering, principle, that, would, prove, more, beneficial, through, his, philosophy, of, pragmatism, william, james, justifies, religious, beliefs, by, using, the, results, of, his, hypothetical, venturing, as, evidence, to, support, the, hypothesis, s, truth, therefore, this, doctrine, allows, one, to, assume, belief, in, a, god, and, prove, its, existence, by, what, the, belief, brings, to, one, s, life, this, was, criticized, by, advocates, of, skepticism, rationality, like, bertrand, russell, in, free, thought, and, official, propaganda, and, alfred, henry, lloyd, with, the, will, to, doubt, both, argued, that, one, must, always, adhere, to, fallibilism, recognizing, of, all, human, knowledge, that, none, of, our, beliefs, are, quite, true, all, have, at, least, a, penumbra, of, vagueness, and, error, and, that, the, only, means, of, progressing, ever, closer, to, the, truth, is, to, never, assume, certainty, but, always, examine, all, sides, and, try, to, reach, a, conclusion, objectively, in, his, search, for, truth, and, assorted, principles, of, psychology, william, james, developed, his, two, stage, model, of, free, will, in, his, model, he, tries, to, explain, how, it, is, people, come, to, the, making, of, a, decision, and, what, factors, are, involved, in, it, he, firstly, defines, our, basic, ability, to, choose, as, free, will, then, he, specifies, our, two, factors, as, chance, and, choice, james, s, two, stage, model, effectively, separates, chance, the, in, deterministic, free, element, from, choice, an, arguably, determinate, decision, that, follows, causally, from, one, s, character, values, and, especially, feelings, and, desires, at, the, moment, of, decision, james, argues, that, the, question, of, free, will, revolves, around, chance, the, idea, of, chance, is, that, some, events, are, possibilities, things, that, could, happen, but, are, not, guaranteed, chance, is, a, neutral, term, it, is, in, this, case, neither, inherently, positive, nor, intrinsically, irrational, and, preposterous, connotations, it, usually, has, the, only, information, it, gives, about, the, events, to, which, it, applies, is, that, they, are, disconnected, from, other, things, they, are, not, controlled, secured, or, necessitated, by, other, things, before, they, happen, chance, is, made, possible, regarding, our, actions, because, our, amount, of, effort, is, subject, to, change, if, the, amount, of, effort, we, put, into, something, is, predetermined, our, actions, are, predetermined, free, will, in, relation, to, effort, also, balances, ideals, and, propensities, the, things, you, see, as, best, versus, the, things, that, are, easiest, to, do, without, effort, the, propensity, is, stronger, than, the, ideal, to, act, according, to, your, ideals, you, must, resist, the, things, that, are, easiest, and, this, can, only, be, done, with, effort, james, states, that, the, free, will, question, is, therefore, simple, it, relates, solely, to, the, amount, of, effort, of, attention, or, consent, which, we, can, at, any, time, put, forth, chance, is, the, free, element, that, part, of, the, model, we, have, no, control, over, james, says, that, in, the, sequence, of, the, model, chance, comes, before, choice, in, the, moment, of, decision, we, are, given, the, chance, to, make, a, decision, and, then, the, choice, is, what, we, do, or, do, not, do, regarding, the, decision, when, it, comes, to, choice, james, says, we, make, a, choice, based, on, different, experiences, it, comes, from, our, own, past, experiences, the, observations, of, others, or, a, supply, of, ideas, of, the, various, movements, that, are, left, in, the, memory, by, experiences, of, their, involuntary, performance, is, thus, the, first, prerequisite, of, the, voluntary, life, what, james, describes, is, that, once, you, ve, made, a, decision, in, the, past, the, experience, is, stockpiled, into, your, memory, where, it, can, be, referenced, the, next, time, a, decision, must, be, made, and, will, be, drawn, from, as, a, positive, solution, however, in, his, development, of, the, design, james, also, struggled, with, being, able, to, prove, that, free, will, is, actually, free, or, predetermined, people, can, make, judgements, of, regret, moral, approval, and, moral, disapproval, and, if, those, are, absent, then, that, means, our, will, is, predetermined, an, example, of, this, is, james, says, the, problem, is, a, very, personal, one, and, that, he, cannot, personally, conceive, of, the, universe, as, a, place, where, murder, must, happen, essentially, if, there, were, no, regrets, or, judgments, then, all, the, bad, stuff, would, not, be, considered, bad, only, as, predetermined, because, there, are, no, options, of, good, and, bad, the, free, will, option, is, pragmatically, truer, because, it, better, accommodates, the, judgments, of, regret, and, morality, overall, james, uses, this, line, of, reasoning, to, prove, that, our, will, is, indeed, free, because, of, our, morality, codes, and, the, conceivable, alternate, universes, where, a, decision, has, been, regarded, different, from, what, we, chose, in, the, will, to, believe, james, simply, asserted, that, his, will, was, free, as, his, first, act, of, freedom, he, said, he, chose, to, believe, his, will, was, free, he, was, encouraged, to, do, this, by, reading, charles, renouvier, whose, work, convinced, james, to, convert, from, monism, to, pluralism, in, his, diary, entry, of, april, 30, 1870, james, wrote, i, think, that, yesterday, was, a, crisis, in, my, life, i, finished, the, first, part, of, renouvier, s, second, essais, and, see, no, reason, why, his, definition, of, free, will, the, sustaining, of, a, thought, because, i, choose, to, when, i, might, have, other, thoughts, need, be, the, definition, of, an, illusion, at, any, rate, i, will, assume, for, the, present, until, next, year, that, it, is, no, illusion, my, first, act, of, free, will, shall, be, to, believe, in, free, will, in, 1884, james, set, the, terms, for, all, future, discussions, of, determinism, and, compatibilism, in, the, free, will, debates, with, his, lecture, to, harvard, divinity, school, students, published, as, the, dilemma, of, determinism, in, this, talk, he, defined, the, common, terms, hard, determinism, and, soft, determinism, now, more, commonly, called, compatibilism, old, fashioned, determinism, was, what, we, may, call, hard, determinism, it, did, not, shrink, from, such, words, as, fatality, bondage, of, the, will, necessitation, and, the, like, nowadays, we, have, a, soft, determinism, which, abhors, harsh, words, and, repudiating, fatality, necessity, and, even, predetermination, says, that, its, real, name, is, freedom, for, freedom, is, only, necessity, understood, and, bondage, to, the, highest, is, identical, with, true, freedom, 149, james, called, compatibilism, a, quagmire, of, evasion, 149, just, as, the, ideas, of, thomas, hobbes, and, david, hume, that, free, will, was, simply, freedom, from, external, coercion, were, called, a, wretched, subterfuge, by, immanuel, kant, indeterminism, is, the, belief, in, freedom, holds, that, there, is, some, degree, of, possibility, that, is, not, necessitated, by, the, rest, of, reality, the, word, some, in, this, definition, is, crucial, in, james, s, argument, because, it, leaves, room, for, a, higher, power, as, it, does, not, require, that, all, events, be, random, specifically, indeterminism, does, not, say, that, no, events, are, guaranteed, or, connected, to, previous, events, instead, it, says, that, some, events, are, not, guaranteed, some, events, are, up, to, chance, in, james, s, model, of, free, will, choice, is, deterministic, determined, by, the, person, making, it, and, it, follows, casually, from, one, s, character, values, and, especially, feelings, and, desires, at, the, moment, of, decision, chance, on, the, other, hand, is, indeterministic, and, pertains, to, possibilities, that, could, happen, but, are, not, guaranteed, james, described, chance, as, neither, hard, nor, soft, determinism, but, indeterminism, 153, the, stronghold, of, the, determinist, argument, is, the, antipathy, to, the, idea, of, chance, this, notion, of, alternative, possibility, this, admission, that, any, one, of, several, things, may, come, to, pass, is, after, all, only, a, roundabout, name, for, chance, james, asked, the, students, to, consider, his, choice, for, walking, home, from, lowell, lecture, hall, after, his, talk, 155, what, is, meant, by, saying, that, my, choice, of, which, way, to, walk, home, after, the, lecture, is, ambiguous, and, matter, of, chance, it, means, that, both, divinity, avenue, and, oxford, street, are, called, but, only, one, and, that, one, either, one, shall, be, chosen, with, this, simple, example, james, laid, out, a, two, stage, decision, process, with, chance, in, a, present, time, of, random, alternatives, leading, to, a, choice, of, one, possibility, that, transforms, an, ambiguous, future, into, a, simple, unalterable, past, james, s, two, stage, model, separates, chance, undetermined, alternative, possibilities, from, choice, the, free, action, of, the, individual, on, which, randomness, has, no, effect, subsequent, thinkers, using, this, model, include, henri, poincar, arthur, holly, compton, and, karl, popper, james, did, important, work, in, philosophy, of, religion, in, his, gifford, lectures, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, he, provided, a, wide, ranging, account, of, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, 1902, and, interpreted, them, according, to, his, pragmatic, leanings, some, of, the, important, claims, he, makes, in, this, regard, james, investigated, mystical, experiences, throughout, his, life, leading, him, to, experiment, with, chloral, hydrate, 1870, amyl, nitrite, 1875, nitrous, oxide, 1882, and, peyote, 1896, james, claimed, that, it, was, only, when, he, was, under, the, influence, of, nitrous, oxide, that, he, was, able, to, understand, hegel, he, concluded, that, while, the, revelations, of, the, mystic, hold, true, they, hold, true, only, for, the, mystic, for, others, they, are, certainly, ideas, to, be, considered, but, can, hold, no, claim, to, truth, without, personal, experience, of, such, american, philosophy, an, encyclopedia, classes, him, as, one, of, several, figures, who, took, a, more, pantheist, or, pandeist, approach, by, rejecting, views, of, god, as, separate, from, the, world, james, was, an, advocate, of, theistic, finitism, which, he, used, to, explain, the, problem, of, evil, william, james, devoted, much, of, his, career, to, the, psychological, investigation, of, mysticism, a, significant, influence, on, this, undertaking, was, his, own, mystical, experience, under, the, influence, of, nitrous, oxide, inspired, by, a, report, by, benjamin, paul, blood, in, 1874, james, experimented, with, inhaled, nitrous, oxide, upon, which, he, experienced, a, tremendously, exciting, sense, of, an, intense, metaphysical, illumination, in, which, every, opposition, vanished, in, a, higher, unity, and, the, ego, and, its, objects, are, one, for, so, ardent, an, anti, hegelian, this, was, a, particularly, novel, and, confusing, experience, for, james, he, was, powerfully, affected, by, the, event, and, struggled, greatly, to, interpret, it, his, journey, of, self, discovery, instigated, by, the, experience, is, largely, what, inspired, his, later, in, depth, investigations, of, mysticism, william, james, provided, a, description, of, mystical, experience, in, his, famous, collection, of, lectures, published, in, 1902, as, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, he, posits, four, criteria, as, sufficient, to, mark, out, a, group, of, states, of, consciousness, which, may, be, called, the, mystical, group, these, criteria, are, as, follows, for, james, the, first, two, attributes, ineffability, and, the, noetic, quality, will, entitle, any, state, to, be, called, mystical, in, the, sense, in, which, i, use, the, word, the, qualities, of, transiency, and, passivity, are, less, sharply, marked, but, are, usually, found, he, uses, a, number, of, historical, examples, to, illustrate, the, presence, of, these, attributes, in, geographically, and, temporally, disparate, instances, concluding, that, the, mystical, experience, is, on, the, whole, pantheistic, and, optimistic, or, at, least, the, opposite, of, pessimistic, it, is, anti, naturalistic, and, harmonizes, best, with, twice, bornness, and, so, called, other, worldly, states, of, mind, original, italics, in, line, with, his, pragmatism, he, asserted, that, the, epistemological, authority, of, mystical, consciousness, for, the, individual, who, experiences, it, is, may, be, rightfully, justified, but, that, others, are, under, no, obligation, to, accept, that, authority, uncritically, importantly, however, the, mere, existence, of, mystical, states, necessarily, indicates, an, incompleteness, in, the, epistemological, authority, of, the, non, mystical, he, would, continue, to, advocate, for, the, acceptance, of, mystical, states, as, a, fruitful, subject, of, psychological, research, and, source, of, knowledge, in, his, book, the, pluralistic, universe, 1909, he, would, expand, upon, his, notion, of, radical, empiricism, in, arguing, for, the, possible, association, of, empiricism, and, religion, in, the, study, of, human, spirituality, in, viewing, mysticism, from, a, psychological, perspective, he, acknowledged, that, the, limits, of, our, being, extend, far, beyond, what, is, ordinarily, accessible, by, our, sense, perception, and, that, our, finite, beings, are, affected, by, unconscious, forces, but, that, which, produces, effects, within, another, reality, must, be, termed, a, reality, itself, so, i, feel, as, if, we, had, no, philosophic, excuse, for, calling, the, unseen, or, mystical, world, unreal, james, viewed, mysticism, as, the, most, foundational, aspect, of, religion, while, he, grants, that, religious, experience, reveals, the, possibility, of, union, with, something, greater, than, oneself, he, clarifies, that, mysticism, and, philosophy, identify, that, something, as, an, all, inclusive, soul, of, the, world, that, he, does, not, deem, wholly, necessary, for, a, practical, and, fulfilling, religious, life, as, always, james, is, averse, to, any, dogmatic, or, absolutist, doctrines, within, religion, and, without, and, thus, values, mysticism, as, a, unique, method, of, personal, acquaintance, with, a, larger, reality, like, sigmund, freud, james, was, influenced, by, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, at, the, core, of, james, s, theory, of, psychology, as, defined, in, the, principles, of, psychology, 1890, was, a, system, of, instincts, james, wrote, that, humans, had, many, instincts, even, more, than, other, animals, these, instincts, he, said, could, be, overridden, by, experience, and, by, each, other, as, many, of, the, instincts, were, actually, in, conflict, with, each, other, in, the, 1920s, however, psychology, turned, away, from, evolutionary, theory, and, embraced, radical, behaviorism, james, is, one, of, the, two, namesakes, of, the, james, lange, theory, of, emotion, which, he, formulated, independently, of, carl, lange, in, the, 1880s, the, theory, holds, that, emotion, is, the, mind, s, perception, of, physiological, conditions, that, result, from, some, stimulus, in, james, s, oft, cited, example, it, is, not, that, we, see, a, bear, fear, it, and, run, we, see, a, bear, and, run, consequently, we, fear, the, bear, our, mind, s, perception, of, the, higher, adrenaline, level, heartbeat, etc, is, the, emotion, this, way, of, thinking, about, emotion, has, great, consequences, for, the, philosophy, of, aesthetics, as, well, as, to, the, philosophy, and, practice, of, education, here, is, a, passage, from, his, work, the, principles, of, psychology, that, spells, out, those, consequences, e, must, immediately, insist, that, aesthetic, emotion, pure, and, simple, the, pleasure, given, us, by, certain, lines, and, masses, and, combinations, of, colors, and, sounds, is, an, absolutely, sensational, experience, an, optical, or, auricular, feeling, that, is, primary, and, not, due, to, the, repercussion, backwards, of, other, sensations, elsewhere, consecutively, aroused, to, this, simple, primary, and, immediate, pleasure, in, certain, pure, sensations, and, harmonious, combinations, of, them, there, may, it, is, true, be, added, secondary, pleasures, and, in, the, practical, enjoyment, of, works, of, art, by, the, masses, of, mankind, these, secondary, pleasures, play, a, great, part, the, more, classic, one, s, taste, is, however, the, less, relatively, important, are, the, secondary, pleasures, felt, to, be, in, comparison, with, those, of, the, primary, sensation, as, it, comes, in, classicism, and, romanticism, have, their, battles, over, this, point, the, theory, of, emotion, was, also, independently, developed, in, italy, by, the, anthropologist, giuseppe, sergi, from, joseph, ledoux, s, description, of, william, james, emotion, why, do, we, run, away, if, we, notice, that, we, are, in, danger, because, we, are, afraid, of, what, will, happen, if, we, don, t, this, obvious, answer, to, a, seemingly, trivial, question, has, been, the, central, concern, of, a, century, old, debate, about, the, nature, of, our, emotions, it, all, began, in, 1884, when, william, james, published, an, article, titled, what, is, an, emotion, the, article, appeared, in, a, philosophy, journal, called, mind, as, there, were, no, psychology, journals, yet, it, was, important, not, because, it, definitively, answered, the, question, it, raised, but, because, of, the, way, in, which, james, phrased, his, response, he, conceived, of, an, emotion, in, terms, of, a, sequence, of, events, that, starts, with, the, occurrence, of, an, arousing, stimulus, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, or, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, and, ends, with, a, passionate, feeling, a, conscious, emotional, experience, a, major, goal, of, emotion, research, is, still, to, elucidate, this, stimulus, to, feeling, sequence, to, figure, out, what, processes, come, between, the, stimulus, and, the, feeling, james, set, out, to, answer, his, question, by, asking, another, do, we, run, from, a, bear, because, we, are, afraid, or, are, we, afraid, because, we, run, he, proposed, that, the, obvious, answer, that, we, run, because, we, are, afraid, was, wrong, and, instead, argued, that, we, are, afraid, because, we, run, our, natural, way, of, thinking, about, emotions, is, that, the, mental, perception, of, some, fact, excites, the, mental, affection, called, emotion, and, that, this, latter, state, of, mind, gives, rise, to, the, bodily, expression, my, theory, on, the, contrary, is, that, the, bodily, changes, follow, directly, the, perception, of, the, exciting, fact, and, that, our, feeling, of, the, same, changes, as, they, occur, is, the, emotion, called, feeling, by, damasio, the, essence, of, james, s, proposal, was, simple, it, was, premised, on, the, fact, that, emotions, are, often, accompanied, by, bodily, responses, racing, heart, tight, stomach, sweaty, palms, tense, muscles, and, so, on, sympathetic, nervous, system, and, that, we, can, sense, what, is, going, on, inside, our, body, much, the, same, as, we, can, sense, what, is, going, on, in, the, outside, world, according, to, james, emotions, feel, different, from, other, states, of, mind, because, they, have, these, bodily, responses, that, give, rise, to, internal, sensations, and, different, emotions, feel, different, from, one, another, because, they, are, accompanied, by, different, bodily, responses, and, sensations, for, example, when, we, see, james, s, bear, we, run, away, during, this, act, of, escape, the, body, goes, through, a, physiological, upheaval, blood, pressure, rises, heart, rate, increases, pupils, dilate, palms, sweat, muscles, contract, in, certain, ways, evolutionary, innate, defense, mechanisms, other, kinds, of, emotional, situations, will, result, in, different, bodily, upheavals, in, each, case, the, physiological, responses, return, to, the, brain, in, the, form, of, bodily, sensations, and, the, unique, pattern, of, sensory, feedback, gives, each, emotion, its, unique, quality, fear, feels, different, from, anger, or, love, because, it, has, a, different, physiological, signature, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, for, love, the, mental, aspect, of, emotion, the, feeling, is, a, slave, to, its, physiology, not, vice, versa, we, do, not, tremble, because, we, are, afraid, or, cry, because, we, feel, sad, we, are, afraid, because, we, tremble, and, are, sad, because, we, cry, one, of, the, long, standing, schisms, in, the, philosophy, of, history, concerns, the, role, of, individuals, in, social, change, one, faction, sees, individuals, as, seen, in, dickens, a, tale, of, two, cities, and, thomas, carlyle, s, the, french, revolution, a, history, as, the, motive, power, of, history, and, the, broader, society, as, the, page, on, which, they, write, their, acts, the, other, sees, society, as, moving, according, to, holistic, principles, or, laws, and, sees, individuals, as, its, more, or, less, willing, pawns, in, 1880, james, waded, into, this, controversy, with, great, men, great, thoughts, and, the, environment, an, essay, published, in, the, atlantic, monthly, he, took, carlyle, s, side, but, without, carlyle, s, one, sided, emphasis, on, the, political, military, sphere, upon, heroes, as, the, founders, or, overthrowers, of, states, and, empires, a, philosopher, according, to, james, must, accept, geniuses, as, a, given, entity, the, same, way, as, a, biologist, accepts, as, an, entity, darwin, s, spontaneous, variations, the, role, of, an, individual, will, depend, on, the, degree, of, its, conformity, with, the, social, environment, epoch, moment, etc, james, introduces, a, notion, of, receptivities, of, the, moment, the, societal, mutations, from, generation, to, generation, are, determined, directly, or, indirectly, mainly, by, the, acts, or, examples, of, individuals, whose, genius, was, so, adapted, to, the, receptivities, of, the, moment, or, whose, accidental, position, of, authority, was, so, critical, that, they, became, ferments, initiators, of, movements, setters, of, precedent, or, fashion, centers, of, corruption, or, destroyers, of, other, persons, whose, gifts, had, they, had, free, play, would, have, led, society, in, another, direction, while, james, accepted, darwin, s, theories, of, biological, evolution, he, regarded, social, darwinism, as, propagated, by, philosophers, such, as, herbert, spencer, as, a, sham, he, was, highly, skeptical, of, applying, darwin, s, formula, of, natural, selection, to, human, societies, in, a, way, that, put, the, anglo, saxons, on, top, of, the, chain, james, rejection, of, social, darwinism, was, a, minority, opinion, at, harvard, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, james, studied, closely, the, schools, of, thought, known, as, associationism, and, spiritualism, the, view, of, an, associationist, is, that, each, experience, that, one, has, leads, to, another, creating, a, chain, of, events, the, association, does, not, tie, together, two, ideas, but, rather, physical, objects, this, association, occurs, on, an, atomic, level, small, physical, changes, occur, in, the, brain, which, eventually, form, complex, ideas, or, associations, thoughts, are, formed, as, these, complex, ideas, work, together, and, lead, to, new, experiences, isaac, newton, and, david, hartley, both, were, precursors, to, this, school, of, thought, proposing, such, ideas, as, physical, vibrations, in, the, brain, spinal, cord, and, nerves, are, the, basis, of, all, sensations, all, ideas, and, all, motions, james, disagreed, with, associationism, in, that, he, believed, it, to, be, too, simple, he, referred, to, associationism, as, psychology, without, a, soul, because, there, is, nothing, from, within, creating, ideas, they, just, arise, by, associating, objects, with, one, another, on, the, other, hand, a, spiritualist, believes, that, mental, events, are, attributed, to, the, soul, whereas, in, associationism, ideas, and, behaviors, are, separate, in, spiritualism, they, are, connected, spiritualism, encompasses, the, term, innatism, which, suggests, that, ideas, cause, behavior, ideas, of, past, behavior, influence, the, way, a, person, will, act, in, the, future, these, ideas, are, all, tied, together, by, the, soul, therefore, an, inner, soul, causes, one, to, have, a, thought, which, leads, them, to, perform, a, behavior, and, memory, of, past, behaviors, determine, how, one, will, act, in, the, future, james, had, a, strong, opinion, about, these, schools, of, thought, he, was, by, nature, a, pragmatist, and, thus, took, the, view, that, one, should, use, whatever, parts, of, theories, make, the, most, sense, and, can, be, proven, therefore, he, recommended, breaking, apart, spiritualism, and, associationism, and, using, the, parts, of, them, that, make, the, most, sense, james, believed, that, each, person, has, a, soul, which, exists, in, a, spiritual, universe, and, leads, a, person, to, perform, the, behaviors, they, do, in, the, physical, world, james, was, influenced, by, emanuel, swedenborg, who, first, introduced, him, to, this, idea, james, stated, that, although, it, does, appear, that, humans, use, associations, to, move, from, one, event, to, the, next, this, cannot, be, done, without, this, soul, tying, everything, together, for, after, an, association, has, been, made, it, is, the, person, who, decides, which, part, of, it, to, focus, on, and, therefore, determines, in, which, direction, following, associations, will, lead, associationism, is, too, simple, in, that, it, does, not, account, for, decision, making, of, future, behaviors, and, memory, of, what, worked, well, and, what, did, not, spiritualism, however, does, not, demonstrate, actual, physical, representations, for, how, associations, occur, james, combined, the, views, of, spiritualism, and, associationism, to, create, his, own, way, of, thinking, james, discussed, tender, minded, thinkers, as, religious, optimistic, dogmatic, and, monistic, tough, minded, thinkers, were, irreligious, pessimistic, pluralists, and, skeptical, healthy, minded, individuals, were, seen, as, natural, believers, by, having, faith, in, god, and, universal, order, people, who, focused, on, human, miseries, and, suffering, were, noted, as, sick, souls, james, was, a, founding, member, and, vice, president, of, the, american, society, for, psychical, research, the, lending, of, his, name, made, leonora, piper, a, famous, medium, in, 1885, the, year, after, the, death, of, his, young, son, james, had, his, first, sitting, with, piper, at, the, suggestion, of, his, mother, in, law, he, was, soon, convinced, that, piper, knew, things, she, could, only, have, discovered, by, supernatural, means, he, expressed, his, belief, in, piper, by, saying, if, you, wish, to, upset, the, law, that, all, crows, are, black, it, is, enough, if, you, prove, that, one, crow, is, white, my, white, crow, is, mrs, piper, however, james, did, not, believe, that, piper, was, in, contact, with, spirits, after, evaluating, sixty, nine, reports, of, piper, s, mediumship, he, considered, the, hypothesis, of, telepathy, as, well, as, piper, obtaining, information, about, her, sitters, by, natural, means, such, as, her, memory, recalling, information, according, to, james, the, spirit, control, hypothesis, of, her, mediumship, was, incoherent, irrelevant, and, in, cases, demonstrably, false, james, held, s, ances, with, piper, and, was, impressed, by, some, of, the, details, he, was, given, however, according, to, massimo, polidoro, a, maid, in, the, household, of, james, was, friendly, with, a, maid, in, piper, s, house, and, this, may, have, been, a, source, of, information, that, piper, used, for, private, details, about, james, bibliographers, frederick, burkhardt, and, fredson, bowers, who, compiled, the, works, of, james, wrote, it, is, thus, possible, that, mrs, piper, s, knowledge, of, the, james, family, was, acquired, from, the, gossip, of, servants, and, that, the, whole, mystery, rests, on, the, failure, of, the, people, upstairs, to, realize, that, servants, also, have, ears, james, was, convinced, that, the, future, will, corroborate, the, existence, of, telepathy, psychologists, such, as, james, mckeen, cattell, and, edward, b, titchener, took, issue, with, james, s, support, for, psychical, research, and, considered, his, statements, unscientific, cattell, in, a, letter, to, james, wrote, that, the, society, for, psychical, research, is, doing, much, to, injure, psychology, james, theory, of, the, self, divided, a, person, s, mental, picture, of, self, into, two, categories, the, me, and, the, i, the, me, can, be, thought, of, as, a, separate, object, or, individual, a, person, refers, to, when, describing, their, personal, experiences, while, the, i, is, the, self, that, knows, who, they, are, and, what, they, have, done, in, their, life, both, concepts, are, depicted, in, the, statement, i, know, it, was, me, who, ate, the, cookie, he, called, the, me, part, of, self, the, empirical, me, and, the, i, part, the, pure, ego, for, james, the, i, part, of, self, was, the, thinking, self, which, could, not, be, further, divided, he, linked, this, part, of, the, self, to, the, soul, of, a, person, or, what, is, now, thought, of, as, the, mind, educational, theorists, have, been, inspired, in, various, ways, by, james, s, theory, of, self, and, have, developed, various, applications, to, curricular, and, pedagogical, theory, and, practice, james, further, divided, the, me, part, of, self, into, a, material, a, social, and, a, spiritual, self, as, below, the, material, self, consists, of, things, that, belong, to, a, person, or, entities, that, a, person, belongs, to, thus, things, like, the, body, family, clothes, money, and, such, make, up, the, material, self, for, james, the, core, of, the, material, self, was, the, body, second, to, the, body, james, felt, a, person, s, clothes, were, important, to, the, material, self, he, believed, a, person, s, clothes, were, one, way, they, expressed, who, they, felt, they, were, or, clothes, were, a, way, to, show, status, thus, contributing, to, forming, and, maintaining, one, s, self, image, money, and, family, are, critical, parts, of, the, material, self, james, felt, that, if, one, lost, a, family, member, a, part, of, who, they, are, was, lost, also, money, figured, in, one, s, material, self, in, a, similar, way, if, a, person, had, significant, money, then, lost, it, who, they, were, as, a, person, changed, as, well, our, social, selves, are, who, we, are, in, a, given, social, situation, for, james, people, change, how, they, act, depending, on, the, social, situation, that, they, are, in, james, believed, that, people, had, as, many, social, selves, as, they, did, social, situations, they, participated, in, for, example, a, person, may, act, in, a, different, way, at, work, when, compared, to, how, that, same, person, may, act, when, they, are, out, with, a, group, of, friends, james, also, believed, that, in, a, given, social, group, an, individual, s, social, self, may, be, divided, even, further, an, example, of, this, would, be, in, the, social, context, of, an, individual, s, work, environment, the, difference, in, behavior, when, that, individual, is, interacting, with, their, boss, versus, their, behavior, when, interacting, with, a, co, worker, for, james, the, spiritual, self, was, who, we, are, at, our, core, it, is, more, concrete, or, permanent, than, the, other, two, selves, the, spiritual, self, is, our, subjective, and, most, intimate, self, aspects, of, a, spiritual, self, include, things, like, personality, core, values, and, conscience, that, do, not, typically, change, throughout, an, individual, s, lifetime, the, spiritual, self, involves, introspection, or, looking, inward, to, deeper, spiritual, moral, or, intellectual, questions, without, the, influence, of, objective, thoughts, for, james, achieving, a, high, level, of, understanding, of, who, we, are, at, our, core, or, understanding, our, spiritual, selves, is, more, rewarding, than, satisfying, the, needs, of, the, social, and, material, selves, what, james, refers, to, as, the, i, self, for, james, the, pure, ego, is, what, provides, the, thread, of, continuity, between, our, past, present, and, future, selves, the, pure, ego, s, perception, of, consistent, individual, identity, arises, from, a, continuous, stream, of, consciousness, james, believed, that, the, pure, ego, was, similar, to, what, we, think, of, as, the, soul, or, the, mind, the, pure, ego, was, not, a, substance, and, therefore, could, not, be, examined, by, science
