of, leg, spin, which, many, cricket, followers, had, come, to, regard, as, a, dying, art, due, to, the, difficulty, of, accurately, bowling, the, deliveries, warne, helped, overturn, the, domination, of, cricket, by, fast, bowling, that, had, prevailed, for, twenty, years, before, his, debut, in, the, early, 1970s, australia, s, fast, bowlers, dennis, lillee, and, jeff, thomson, dominated, cricket, from, around, 1977, until, the, early, 1990s, the, west, indies, lost, only, one, ill, tempered, and, controversial, test, series, with, a, bowling, attack, almost, exclusively, composed, of, four, fast, bowlers, from, the, early, 1990s, with, the, west, indies, in, decline, waqar, younis, and, wasim, akram, of, pakistan, were, becoming, the, world, s, most, feared, fast, bowling, combination, in, this, context, warne, s, bowling, became, significant, his, dominance, particularly, of, english, and, south, african, batsmen, provided, cricket, audiences, with, an, alternative, skill, warne, combined, the, ability, to, prodigiously, turn, the, ball, even, on, unhelpful, pitches, with, regular, accuracy, and, a, variation, of, deliveries, notable, among, these, is, the, flipper, in, the, later, stages, of, his, career, variation, was, less, evident, despite, regular, press, conferences, announcing, a, new, delivery, for, each, series, he, participated, in, many, of, warne, s, most, spectacular, performances, occurred, in, ashes, series, against, england, in, particular, the, gatting, ball, better, known, as, the, ball, of, the, century, which, drifted, significantly, out, of, the, hand, pitching, well, outside, leg, stump, and, sharply, spun, past, the, front, of, the, bat, clipping, the, top, of, off, stump, bowling, a, bemused, mike, gatting, in,

two, batsmen, at, the, same, over, warne, was, a, fierce, and, dramatic, competitor, haigh, wrote, about, what, he, called, warne, s, pageantry, and, measured, theatricality, including, his, exaggerated, appeals, intimidation, of, batters, sledging, flirting, with, umpires, and, time, wasting, all, of, which, added, to, his, competitiveness, warne, said, the, part, of, the, art, of, bowling, spin, is, to, make, the, batsman, think, that, something, special, is, happening, even, when, it, isn, t, warne, was, an, effective, lower, order, batter, he, was, once, dismissed, for, 99, with, a, reckless, shot, on, what, was, later, shown, to, be, a, no, ball, warne, has, scored, the, most, test, runs, without, having, scored, a, century, his, top, scores, were, 99, and, 90, he,
