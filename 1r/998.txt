zarathushtra, spitama, more, commonly, known, as, zoroaster, or, zarathustra, was, an, iranian, religious, reformer, who, challenged, the, tenets, of, the, contemporary, ancient, iranian, religion, becoming, the, spiritual, founder, of, zoroastrianism, variously, described, as, a, sage, or, a, wonderworker, in, the, oldest, zoroastrian, scriptures, the, gathas, which, he, is, believed, to, have, authored, he, is, described, as, a, preacher, and, a, poet, prophet, he, also, had, an, impact, on, heraclitus, plato, pythagoras, and, the, abrahamic, religions, including, judaism, christianity, and, islam, he, spoke, an, eastern, iranian, language, named, avestan, by, scholars, after, the, corpus, of, zoroastrian, religious, texts, written, in, that, language, based, on, this, it, is, tentative, to, place, his, homeland, somewhere, in, the, eastern, regions, of, greater, iran, perhaps, in, modern, day, afghanistan, or, tajikistan, but, his, exact, birthplace, is, uncertain, his, life, is, traditionally, dated, to, sometime, around, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, making, him, a, contemporary, of, cyrus, the, great, though, most, scholars, using, linguistic, and, socio, cultural, evidence, suggest, a, dating, to, somewhere, in, the, second, millennium, bc, zoroastrianism, eventually, became, iran, s, most, prominent, religion, from, around, the, 6th, century, bc, enjoying, official, sanction, during, the, time, of, the, sassanid, empire, until, the, 7th, century, ad, when, the, religion, itself, began, to, decline, following, the, arab, muslim, conquest, of, iran, zoroaster, is, credited, with, authorship, of, the, gathas, as, well, as, the, yasna, haptanghaiti, a, series, of, hymns, composed, in, old, avestan, that, cover, the, core, of, zoroastrian, thinking, little, is, known, about, zoroaster, most, of, his, life, is, known, only, from, these, scant, texts, by, any, modern, standard, of, historiography, no, evidence, can, place, him, into, a, fixed, period, and, the, historicization, surrounding, him, may, be, a, part, of, a, trend, from, before, the, 10th, century, ad, that, historicizes, legends, and, myths, zoroaster, s, name, in, his, native, language, avestan, was, probably, zara, u, tra, his, translated, name, zoroaster, derives, from, a, later, 5th, century, bc, greek, transcription, z, roastr, s, as, used, in, xanthus, s, lydiaca, fragment, 32, and, in, plato, s, first, alcibiades, 122a1, this, form, appears, subsequently, in, the, latin, z, roastr, s, and, in, later, greek, orthographies, as, z, roastris, the, greek, form, of, the, name, appears, to, be, based, on, a, phonetic, transliteration, or, semantic, substitution, of, avestan, zara, with, the, greek, z, ros, literally, undiluted, and, the, bmac, substrate, u, tra, with, astron, star, in, avestan, zara, u, tra, is, generally, accepted, to, derive, from, an, old, iranian, zaratu, tra, the, element, half, of, the, name, u, tra, is, thought, to, be, the, indo, iranian, root, for, camel, with, the, entire, name, meaning, he, who, can, manage, camels, reconstructions, from, later, iranian, languages, particularly, from, the, middle, persian, 300, bc, zardusht, which, is, the, form, that, the, name, took, in, the, 9th, to, 12th, century, zoroastrian, texts, suggest, that, zaratu, tra, might, be, a, zero, grade, form, of, zarantu, tra, subject, then, to, whether, zara, u, tra, derives, from, zarantu, tra, or, from, zaratu, tra, several, interpretations, have, been, proposed, if, zarantu, tra, is, the, original, form, it, may, mean, with, old, aging, camels, related, to, avestic, zarant, cf, pashto, z, and, ossetian, z, rond, old, middle, persian, z, l, old, the, interpretation, of, the, in, the, avestan, zara, u, tra, was, for, a, time, itself, subjected, to, heated, debate, because, the, is, an, irregular, development, as, a, rule, zarat, a, first, element, that, ends, in, a, dental, consonant, should, have, avestan, zarat, or, zarat, as, a, development, from, it, why, this, is, not, so, for, zara, u, tra, has, not, yet, been, determined, notwithstanding, the, phonetic, irregularity, that, avestan, zara, u, tra, with, its, was, linguistically, an, actual, form, is, shown, by, later, attestations, reflecting, the, same, basis, all, present, day, iranian, language, variants, of, his, name, derive, from, the, middle, iranian, variants, of, zar, o, t, which, in, turn, all, reflect, avestan, s, fricative, in, middle, persian, the, name, is, zardu, x, t, in, parthian, zarhu, t, in, manichaean, middle, persian, zrdrw, t, in, early, new, persian, zardu, t, and, in, modern, new, persian, the, name, is, zartosht, the, name, is, attested, in, classical, armenian, sources, as, zrada, t, often, with, the, variant, zrade, t, the, most, important, of, these, testimonies, were, provided, by, the, armenian, authors, eznik, of, kolb, elishe, and, movses, khorenatsi, the, spelling, zrada, t, was, formed, through, an, older, form, which, started, with, zur, a, fact, which, the, german, iranologist, friedrich, carl, andreas, 1846, 1930, used, as, evidence, for, a, middle, persian, spoken, form, zur, a, du, t, based, on, this, assumption, andreas, even, went, so, far, to, form, conclusions, from, this, also, for, the, avestan, form, of, the, name, however, the, modern, iranologist, r, diger, schmitt, rejects, andreas, s, assumption, and, states, that, the, older, form, which, started, with, zur, was, just, influenced, by, armenian, zur, wrong, unjust, idle, which, therefore, means, that, the, name, must, have, been, reinterpreted, in, an, anti, zoroastrian, sense, by, the, armenian, christians, furthermore, schmitt, adds, it, cannot, be, excluded, that, the, parthian, or, middle, persian, form, which, the, armenians, took, over, zaradu, t, or, the, like, was, merely, metathesized, to, pre, arm, zurada, t, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, dating, of, zoroaster, the, avesta, gives, no, direct, information, about, it, while, historical, sources, are, conflicting, some, scholars, base, their, date, reconstruction, on, the, proto, indo, iranian, language, and, proto, indo, iranian, religion, while, others, use, internal, evidence, while, many, scholars, today, consider, a, date, around, 1000, bc, to, be, the, most, likely, others, still, consider, a, range, of, dates, between, 1500, and, 500, bc, to, be, possible, classical, scholarship, in, the, 6th, to, 4th, century, bc, believed, he, existed, 6, 000, years, before, xerxes, i, s, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, xanthus, eudoxus, aristotle, hermippus, which, is, a, possible, misunderstanding, of, the, zoroastrian, four, cycles, of, 3, 000, years, i, e, 12, 000, years, this, belief, is, recorded, by, diogenes, la, rtius, and, variant, readings, could, place, it, 600, years, before, xerxes, i, somewhere, before, 1000, bc, however, diogenes, also, mentions, hermodorus, s, belief, that, zoroaster, lived, 5, 000, years, before, the, trojan, war, which, would, mean, he, lived, around, 6200, bc, the, 10th, century, suda, provides, a, date, of, 500, years, before, the, trojan, war, pliny, the, elder, cited, eudoxus, which, placed, his, death, 6, 000, years, before, plato, c, 6300, bc, other, pseudo, historical, constructions, are, those, of, aristoxenus, who, recorded, zaratas, the, chaldeaean, to, have, taught, pythagoras, in, babylon, or, lived, at, the, time, of, mythological, ninus, and, semiramis, according, to, pliny, the, elder, there, were, two, zoroasters, the, first, lived, thousands, of, years, ago, while, the, second, accompanied, xerxes, i, in, the, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, some, scholars, propose, that, the, chronological, calculation, for, zoroaster, was, developed, by, persian, magi, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, as, the, early, greeks, learned, about, him, from, the, achaemenids, this, indicates, they, did, not, regard, him, as, a, contemporary, of, cyrus, the, great, but, as, a, remote, figure, some, later, pseudo, historical, and, zoroastrian, sources, the, bundahishn, which, references, a, date, 258, years, before, alexander, place, zoroaster, in, the, 6th, century, bc, which, coincided, with, the, accounts, by, ammianus, marcellinus, from, the, 4th, century, ad, the, traditional, zoroastrian, date, originates, in, the, period, immediately, following, alexander, the, great, s, conquest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 330, bc, the, seleucid, rulers, who, gained, power, following, alexander, s, death, instituted, an, age, of, alexander, as, the, new, calendrical, epoch, this, did, not, appeal, to, the, zoroastrian, priesthood, who, then, attempted, to, establish, an, age, of, zoroaster, to, do, so, they, needed, to, establish, when, zoroaster, had, lived, which, they, accomplished, by, erroneously, according, to, mary, boyce, some, even, identified, cyrus, with, vishtaspa, counting, back, the, length, of, successive, generations, until, they, concluded, that, zoroaster, must, have, lived, 258, years, before, alexander, this, estimate, then, re, appeared, in, the, 9th, to, 12th, century, arabic, and, pahlavi, texts, of, zoroastrian, tradition, like, the, 10th, century, al, masudi, who, cited, a, prophecy, from, a, lost, avestan, book, in, which, zoroaster, foretold, the, empire, s, destruction, in, 300, years, but, the, religion, would, last, for, 1, 000, years, in, modern, scholarship, two, main, approaches, can, be, distinguished, a, late, dating, to, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, based, on, the, indigenous, zoroastrian, tradition, and, an, early, dating, which, places, his, life, more, generally, in, the, 15th, to, 9th, centuries, bc, some, scholars, propose, a, period, between, 7th, and, 6th, century, bc, for, example, c, 650, 600, bc, or, 559, 522, bc, the, latest, possible, date, is, the, mid, 6th, century, bc, at, the, time, of, achaemenid, empire, s, darius, i, or, his, predecessor, cyrus, the, great, this, date, gains, credence, mainly, from, attempts, to, connect, figures, in, zoroastrian, texts, to, historical, personages, thus, some, have, postulated, that, the, mythical, vishtaspa, who, appears, in, an, account, of, zoroaster, s, life, was, darius, i, s, father, also, named, vishtaspa, or, hystaspes, in, greek, however, if, this, was, true, it, seems, unlikely, that, the, avesta, would, not, mention, that, vishtaspa, s, son, became, the, ruler, of, the, persian, empire, or, that, this, key, fact, about, darius, s, father, would, not, be, mentioned, in, the, behistun, inscription, it, is, also, possible, that, darius, i, s, father, was, named, in, honor, of, the, zoroastrian, patron, indicating, possible, zoroastrian, faith, by, arsames, scholars, such, as, mary, boyce, who, dated, zoroaster, to, somewhere, between, 1700, and, 1000, bc, used, linguistic, and, socio, cultural, evidence, to, place, zoroaster, between, 1500, and, 1000, bc, or, 1200, and, 900, bc, the, basis, of, this, theory, is, primarily, proposed, on, linguistic, similarities, between, the, old, avestan, language, of, the, zoroastrian, gathas, and, the, sanskrit, of, the, rigveda, c, 1700, 1100, bc, a, collection, of, early, vedic, hymns, both, texts, are, considered, to, have, a, common, archaic, indo, iranian, origin, the, gathas, portray, an, ancient, stone, bronze, age, bipartite, society, of, warrior, herdsmen, and, priests, compared, to, bronze, tripartite, society, some, conjecture, that, it, depicts, the, yaz, culture, and, that, it, is, thus, implausible, that, the, gathas, and, rigveda, could, have, been, composed, more, than, a, few, centuries, apart, these, scholars, suggest, that, zoroaster, lived, in, an, isolated, tribe, or, composed, the, gathas, before, the, 1200, 1000, bc, migration, by, the, iranians, from, the, steppe, to, the, iranian, plateau, the, shortfall, of, the, argument, is, the, vague, comparison, and, the, archaic, language, of, gathas, does, not, necessarily, indicate, time, difference, another, possible, date, from, the, 9th, century, bc, or, before, was, suggested, by, silk, road, seattle, using, its, own, interpretations, of, victor, h, mair, s, writings, on, the, topic, mair, himself, guessed, that, zoroaster, could, have, been, born, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, almut, hintze, the, british, library, and, the, european, research, council, have, dated, zoroaster, to, roughly, 3, 500, years, ago, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, traditions, favoring, a, late, date, for, zoroaster, s, life, have, fallen, out, of, vogue, with, some, zoroastian, communities, who, see, the, prospect, of, their, faith, having, more, ancient, roots, than, previously, thought, as, a, welcome, development, the, birthplace, of, zoroaster, is, also, unknown, and, the, language, of, the, gathas, is, not, similar, to, the, proposed, north, western, and, north, eastern, regional, dialects, of, persia, it, is, also, suggested, that, he, was, born, in, one, of, the, two, areas, and, later, lived, in, the, other, area, yasna, 9, and, 17, cite, the, ditya, river, in, airyanem, va, jah, middle,

iranian, tribes, such, as, the, medes, persians, or, even, parthians, the, farvardin, yasht, refers, to, some, iranian, peoples, that, are, unknown, in, the, greek, and, achaemenid, sources, about, the, 6th, and, 5th, century, bc, eastern, iran, the, vendidad, contain, 17, regional, names, most, of, which, are, located, in, north, eastern, and, eastern, iran, however, in, yasna, 59, 18, the, zara, u, trotema, or, supreme, head, of, the, zoroastrian, priesthood, is, said, to, reside, in, ragha, badakhshan, in, the, 9th, to, 12th, century, middle, persian, texts, of, zoroastrian, tradition, this, ragha, and, with, many, other, places, appear, as, locations, in, western, iran, while, the, land, of, media, does, not, figure, at, all, in, the, avesta, the, westernmost, location, noted, in, scripture, is, arachosia, the, b, ndahi, n, or, primordial, creation, 20, 32, and, 24, 15, puts, ragha, in, media, medieval, rai, however, in, avestan, ragha, is, simply, a, toponym, meaning, plain, hillside, apart, from, these, indications, in, middle, persian, sources, that, are, open, to, interpretations, there, are, a, number, of, other, sources, the, greek, and, latin, sources, are, divided, on, the, birthplace, of, zoroaster, there, are, many, greek, accounts, of, zoroaster, referred, usually, as, persian, or, perso, median, zoroaster, ctesias, located, him, in, bactria, diodorus, siculus, placed, him, among, ariaspai, in, sistan, cephalion, and, justin, suggest, east, of, greater, iran, whereas, pliny, and, origen, suggest, west, of, iran, as, his, birthplace, moreover, they, have, the, suggestion, that, there, has, been, more, than, one, zoroaster, on, the, other, hand, in, post, islamic, sources, shahrastani, 1086, 1153, an, iranian, writer, originally, from, shahrist, n, in, present, day, turkmenistan, proposed, that, zoroaster, s, father, was, from, atropatene, also, in, medea, and, his, mother, was, from, rey, coming, from, a, reputed, scholar, of, religions, this, was, a, serious, blow, to, the, various, regions, which, all, claimed, that, zoroaster, originated, from, their, homelands, some, of, which, then, decided, that, zoroaster, must, then, have, then, been, buried, in, their, regions, or, composed, his, gathas, there, or, preached, there, arabic, sources, of, the, same, period, and, the, same, region, of, historical, persia, also, consider, azerbaijan, as, the, birthplace, of, zarathustra, by, the, late, 20th, century, most, scholars, had, settled, on, an, origin, in, eastern, greater, iran, gnoli, proposed, sistan, baluchistan, though, in, a, much, wider, scope, than, the, present, day, province, as, the, homeland, of, zoroastrianism, frye, voted, for, bactria, and, chorasmia, khlopin, suggests, the, tedzen, delta, in, present, day, turkmenistan, sarianidi, considered, the, bactria, margiana, archaeological, complex, region, as, the, native, land, of, the, zoroastrians, and, probably, of, zoroaster, himself, boyce, includes, the, steppes, to, the, west, from, the, volga, the, medieval, from, media, hypothesis, is, no, longer, taken, seriously, and, zaehner, has, even, suggested, that, this, was, a, magi, mediated, issue, to, garner, legitimacy, but, this, has, been, likewise, rejected, by, gershevitch, and, others, the, 2005, encyclopedia, iranica, article, on, the, history, of, zoroastrianism, summarizes, the, issue, with, while, there, is, general, agreement, that, he, did, not, live, in, western, iran, attempts, to, locate, him, in, specific, regions, of, eastern, iran, including, central, asia, remain, tentative, zoroaster, is, recorded, as, the, son, of, pourushaspa, of, the, spitama, family, and, dugd, w, while, his, great, grandfather, was, ha, ataspa, all, the, names, appear, appropriate, to, the, nomadic, tradition, his, father, s, name, means, possessing, gray, horses, with, the, word, aspa, meaning, horse, while, his, mother, s, means, milkmaid, according, to, the, tradition, he, had, four, brothers, two, older, and, two, younger, whose, names, are, given, in, much, later, pahlavi, work, zoroaster, s, training, for, priesthood, probably, started, very, early, around, seven, years, of, age, he, became, a, priest, probably, around, the, age, of, 15, and, according, to, gathas, gaining, knowledge, from, other, teachers, and, personal, experience, from, traveling, when, he, left, his, parents, at, age, 20, by, the, age, of, 30, zoroaster, experienced, a, revelation, during, a, spring, festival, on, the, river, bank, he, saw, a, shining, being, who, revealed, himself, as, vohu, manah, good, purpose, and, taught, him, about, ahura, mazda, wise, lord, and, five, other, radiant, figures, zoroaster, soon, became, aware, of, the, existence, of, two, primal, spirits, the, second, being, angra, mainyu, destructive, spirit, with, opposing, concepts, of, asha, order, and, druj, deception, thus, he, decided, to, spend, his, life, teaching, people, to, seek, asha, he, received, further, revelations, and, saw, a, vision, of, the, seven, amesha, spenta, and, his, teachings, were, collected, in, the, gathas, and, the, avesta, eventually, at, the, age, of, about, 42, zoroaster, received, the, patronage, of, queen, hutaosa, and, a, ruler, named, vishtaspa, an, early, adherent, of, zoroastrianism, possibly, from, bactria, according, to, the, shahnameh, according, to, the, tradition, he, lived, for, many, years, after, vishtaspa, s, conversion, managed, to, establish, a, faithful, community, and, married, three, times, his, first, two, wives, bore, him, three, sons, isat, v, stra, urvatat, nara, and, hvare, chithra, and, three, daughters, freni, thriti, and, pouruchista, his, third, wife, hv, vi, was, childless, zoroaster, died, when, he, was, 77, years, and, 40, days, old, there, are, conflicting, traditions, on, zoroaster, s, manner, of, death, the, most, common, is, that, he, was, murdered, by, a, karapan, priest, of, the, old, religion, named, br, dr, s, while, performing, at, an, altar, the, d, nkart, and, the, epic, shahnameh, ascribe, his, death, to, a, turanian, soldier, named, baraturish, potentially, a, spin, on, the, same, figure, while, other, traditions, combine, both, accounts, or, hold, that, he, died, of, old, age, the, cypress, of, kashmar, is, a, mythical, cypress, tree, of, legendary, beauty, and, gargantuan, dimensions, it, is, said, to, have, sprung, from, a, branch, brought, by, zoroaster, from, paradise, and, to, have, stood, in, today, s, kashmar, in, northeastern, iran, and, to, have, been, planted, by, zoroaster, in, honor, of, the, conversion, of, king, vishtaspa, to, zoroastrianism, according, to, the, iranian, physicist, and, historian, zakariya, al, qazwini, king, vishtaspa, had, been, a, patron, of, zoroaster, who, planted, the, tree, himself, in, his, aj, ib, al, makhl, q, t, wa, ghar, ib, al, mawj, d, t, the, wonders, of, creatures, and, the, marvels, of, creation, he, further, describes, how, the, al, mutawakkil, in, 247, ah, 861, ad, caused, the, mighty, cypress, to, be, felled, and, then, transported, it, across, iran, to, be, used, for, beams, in, his, new, palace, at, samarra, before, he, wanted, the, tree, to, be, reconstructed, before, his, eyes, this, was, done, in, spite, of, protests, by, the, iranians, who, offered, a, very, great, sum, of, money, to, save, the, tree, al, mutawakkil, never, saw, the, cypress, because, he, was, murdered, by, a, turkic, soldier, possibly, in, the, employ, of, his, son, on, the, night, when, it, arrived, on, the, banks, of, the, tigris, athanasius, kircher, identified, zoroaster, with, ham, the, french, figurist, jesuit, missionary, to, china, joachim, bouvet, thought, that, zoroaster, the, chinese, cultural, hero, fuxi, and, hermes, trismegistus, were, actually, the, biblical, patriarch, enoch, the, encyclop, dia, iranica, indicates, that, the, stories, of, zoroaster, s, life, were, distorted, by, quoting, stories, from, christianity, and, judaism, and, attributing, them, to, zoroaster, but, the, most, quotations, were, from, islam, after, the, entry, of, muslims, into, persia, as, it, was, a, means, for, the, zoroastrian, clergy, to, strengthen, their, religion, the, orientalist, arthur, christensen, in, his, book, iran, during, the, sassanid, era, mentioned, that, the, sources, dating, back, to, the, era, of, the, sasanian, state, in, ancient, persian, that, refer, to, the, zoroastrian, doctrine, do, not, match, the, sources, that, appeared, after, the, collapse, of, the, state, such, as, the, pahlavi, source, and, others, the, reason, is, that, because, of, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, state, the, zoroastrian, clerics, tried, to, save, their, religion, from, extinction, through, modifying, it, to, resemble, the, religion, of, muslims, to, retain, followers, in, the, zoroastrian, religion, the, circle, of, ancient, iranian, studies, comments, that, the, islamic, conquest, of, persia, caused, a, huge, impact, on, the, zoroastrian, doctrine, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, persia, and, the, migration, of, many, zoroastrians, to, india, and, after, being, exposed, to, islamic, and, christian, propaganda, the, zoroastrians, especially, the, parsis, in, india, went, so, far, as, to, deny, dualism, and, consider, themselves, completely, monotheists, after, several, transformations, and, developments, one, of, the, distinctive, features, of, the, zoroastrian, religion, gradually, faded, away, and, almost, disappeared, from, modern, zoroastrianism, this, provides, an, explanation, of, why, a, number, of, parallels, have, been, drawn, between, zoroastrian, teachings, and, islam, such, parallels, include, the, evident, similarities, between, amesha, spenta, and, the, archangel, gabriel, praying, five, times, a, day, covering, one, s, head, during, prayer, and, the, mention, of, thamud, and, iram, of, the, pillars, in, the, quran, the, sabians, who, believed, in, free, will, coincident, with, zoroastrians, are, also, mentioned, in, the, quran, 22, 17, like, the, greeks, of, classical, antiquity, islamic, tradition, understands, zoroaster, to, be, the, founding, prophet, of, the, magians, via, aramaic, arabic, majus, collective, majusya, the, 11th, century, cordoban, ibn, hazm, zahiri, school, contends, that, kitabi, of, the, book, cannot, apply, in, light, of, the,

moved, to, a, place, of, modern, day, azerbaijan, which, ruled, by, bashtaasib, vishtaspa, governor, of, nebuchadnezzar, and, spread, his, teaching, of, zoroastrianism, there, bashtaasib, then, followed, his, teaching, forces, the, inhabitants, of, persia, to, convert, to, zoroastrianism, and, killed, those, who, refused, ibn, kathir, has, quoted, the, original, narrative, was, borrowed, from, tabari, s, record, of, the, history, of, jerusalem, he, also, mentioned, that, zoroastrian, was, synonymous, with, majus, sibt, ibn, al, jawzi, instead, stated, that, some, older, narration, said, that, zoroaster, was, a, former, disciple, of, uzair, al, tabari, i, 681, 683, recounts, that, zaradusht, accompanied, a, jewish, prophet, to, bishtasb, vishtaspa, upon, their, arrival,

tell, them, what, he, knows, the, others, do, not, and, he, shall, tell, you, even, what, lies, hidden, in, your, nature, he, shall, be, able, to, tell, you, whatever, you, ask, him, and, he, shall,

zoroaster, to, be, a, figure, in, a, line, of, prophets, of, which, mani, 216, 276, was, the, culmination, zoroaster, s, ethical, dualism, is, to, an, extent, incorporated, in, manichaeism, s, doctrine, which, unlike, mani, s, thoughts, viewed, the, world, as, being, locked, in, an, epic, battle, between, opposing, forces, of, good, and, evil, manicheanism, also, incorporated, other, elements, of, zoroastrian, tradition, particularly, the, names, of, supernatural, beings, however, many, of, these, other, zoroastrian, elements, are, either, not, part, of, zoroaster, s, own, teachings, or, are, used, quite, differently, from, how, they, are, used, in, zoroastrianism, zoroaster, appears, in, the, bah, faith, as, a, manifestation, of, god, one, of, a, line, of, prophets,

the, system, of, religious, ethics, he, founded, called, mazdayasna, the, word, mazdayasna, is, avestan, and, is, translated, as, worship, of, wisdom, mazda, in, english, the, encyclopedia, natural, history, pliny, claims, that, zoroastrians, later, educated, the, greeks, who, starting, with, pythagoras, used, a, similar, term, philosophy, or, love, of, wisdom, to, describe, the, search, for, ultimate, truth, zoroaster, emphasized, the, freedom, of, the, individual, to, choose, right, or, wrong, and, individual, responsibility, for, one, s, deeds, this, personal, choice, to, accept, a, a,

as, saoshyants, world, perfecters, and, eventually, achieving, the, status, of, an, ashavan, master, of, asha, although, a, few, recent, depictions, of, zoroaster, show, him, performing, some, deed, of, legend, in, general, the, portrayals, merely, present, him, in, white, vestments, which, are, also, worn, by, present, day, zoroastrian, priests, he, often, is, seen, holding, a, collection, of, unbound, rods, or, twigs, known, as, a, baresman, avestan, middle, persian, barsom, which, is, generally, considered, to, be, another, symbol, of, priesthood, or, with, a, book, in, hand, which, may, be, interpreted, to, be, the, avesta, alternatively, he, appears, with, a, mace, the, varza, usually, stylized, as, a, steel, rod, crowned, by, a, bull, s, head, that, priests, carry, in, their,

to, be, a, depiction, of, zoroaster, but, in, recent, years, is, more, commonly, interpreted, to, be, a, depiction, of, mithra, the, greeks, in, the, hellenistic, sense, of, the, term, had, an, understanding, of, zoroaster, as, expressed, by, plutarch, diogenes, laertius, and, agathias, that, saw, him, at, the, core, to, be, the, prophet, and, founder, of, the, religion, of, the, iranian, peoples, beck, notes, that, the, rest, was, mostly, fantasy, zoroaster, was, set, in, the, ancient, past, six, to, seven, millennia, before, the, common, era, and, was, described, as, a, king, of, bactria, or, a, babylonian, or, teacher, of, babylonians, and, with, a, biography, typical, of, a, neopythagorean, sage, i, e, having, a, mission, preceded, by, ascetic, withdrawal, and, enlightenment, however, at, first, mentioned, in, the, context, of, dualism, in, moralia, plutarch, presents, zoroaster, as, zaratras, not, realizing, the, two, to, be, the, same, and, he, is, described, as, a, teacher, of, pythagoras, zoroaster, has, also, been, described, as, a, sorcerer, astrologer, the, creator, of, both, magic, and, astrology, deriving, from, that, image, and, reinforcing, it, was, a, mass, of, literature, attributed, to, him, and, that, circulated, the, mediterranean, world, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, end, of, antiquity, and, beyond, the, language, of, that, literature, was, predominantly, greek, though, at, one, stage, or, another, various, parts, of, it, passed, through, aramaic, syriac, coptic, or, latin, its, ethos, and, cultural, matrix, was, likewise, hellenistic, and, the, ascription, of, literature, to, sources, beyond, that, political, cultural, and, temporal, framework, represents, a, bid, for, authority, and, a, fount, of, legitimizing, alien, wisdom, zoroaster, and, the, magi, did, not, compose, it, but, their, names, sanctioned, it, the, attributions, to, exotic, names, not, restricted, to, magians, conferred, an, authority, of, a, remote, and, revelatory, wisdom, among, the, named, works, attributed, to, zoroaster, is, a, treatise, on, nature, peri, physeos, which, appears, to, have, originally, constituted, four, volumes, i, e, papyrus, rolls, the, framework, is, a, retelling, of, plato, s, myth, of, er, with, zoroaster, taking, the, place, of, the, original, hero, while, porphyry, imagined, pythagoras, listening, to, zoroaster, s, discourse, on, nature, has, the, sun, in, middle, position, which, was, how, it, was, understood, in, the, 3rd, century, in, contrast, plato, s, 4th, century, bc, version,

zoroastrian, philosophy, in, order, to, express, his, disagreement, with, plato, on, natural, philosophy, with, respect, to, substance, and, content, in, on, nature, only, two, facts, are, known,

inventor, of, magic, natural, history, 30, 2, 3, however, a, principle, of, the, division, of, labor, appears, to, have, spared, zoroaster, most, of, the, responsibility, for, introducing, the, dark, arts, to, the, greek, and, roman, worlds, that, dubious, honor, went, to, the, fabulous, magus, ostanes, to, whom, most, of, the, pseudepigraphic, magical, literature, was, attributed, although, pliny, calls, him, the, inventor, of, magic, the, roman, does, not, provide, a, magician, s, persona, for, him, moreover, the, little, magical, teaching, that, is, ascribed, to, zoroaster, is, actually, very, late, with, the, very, earliest, example, being, from, the, 14th, century, association, with, astrology, according, to, roger, beck, were, based, on, his, babylonian, origin, and, zoroaster, s, greek, name, was, identified, at, first, with, star, worshiping, astrothytes, star, sacrificer, and, with, the, zo, even, as, the, living, star, later, an, even, more, elaborate, mythoetymology, evolved, zoroaster, died, by, the, living, zo, flux, ro, of, fire, from, the, star, astr, which, he, himself, had, invoked, and, even, that, the, stars, killed, him, in, revenge, for, having, been, restrained, by, him, the, alternate, greek, name, for, zoroaster, was, zaratras, or, zaratas, zaradas, zaratos, pythagoreans, considered, the, mathematicians, to, have, studied, with, zoroaster, in, babylonia, lydus, in, on, the, months, attributes, the, creation, of, the, seven, day, week, to, the, babylonians, in, the, circle, of, zoroaster, and, hystaspes, and, who, did, so, because, there, were, seven, planets, lucian, of, samosata, in, mennipus, 6, reports, deciding, to, journey, to, babylon, to, ask, one, of, the, magi, zoroaster, s, disciples, and, successors, for, their, opinion, while, the, division, along, the, lines, of, zoroaster, astrology, and, ostanes, magic, is, an, oversimplification, the, descriptions, do, at, least, indicate, what, the, works, are, not, they, were, not, expressions, of, zoroastrian, doctrine, they, were, not, even, expressions, of, what, the, greeks, and, romans, imagined, the, doctrines, of, zoroastrianism, to, have, been, the, assembled, fragments, do, not, even, show, noticeable, commonality, of, outlook, and, teaching, among, the, several, authors, who, wrote, under, each, name, almost, all, zoroastrian, pseudepigrapha, is, now, lost, and, of, the, attested, texts, with, only, one, exception, only, fragments, have, survived, pliny, s, 2nd, or, 3rd, century, attribution, of, two, million, lines, to, zoroaster, suggest, that, even, if, exaggeration, and, duplicates, are, taken, into, consideration, a, formidable, pseudepigraphic, corpus, once, existed, at, the, library, of, alexandria, this, corpus, can, safely, be, assumed, to, be, pseudepigrapha, because, no, one, before, pliny, refers, to, literature, by, zoroaster, and, on, the, authority, of, the, 2nd, century, galen, of, pergamon, and, from, a, 6th, century, commentator, on, aristotle, it, is, known, that, the, acquisition, policies, of, well, endowed, royal, libraries, created, a, market, for, fabricating, manuscripts, of, famous, and, ancient, authors, the, exception, to, the, fragmentary, evidence, i, e, reiteration, of, passages, in, works, of, other, authors, is, a, complete, coptic, tractate, titled, zostrianos, after, the, first, person, narrator, discovered, in, the, nag, hammadi, library, in, 1945, a, three, line, cryptogram, in, the, colophones, following, the, 131, page, treatise, identify, the, work, as, words, of, truth, of, zostrianos, god, of, truth, words, of, zoroaster, invoking, a, god, of, truth, might, seem, zoroastrian, but, there, is, otherwise, nothing, noticeably, zoroastrian, about, the, text, and, in, content, style, ethos, and, intention, its, affinities, are, entirely, with, the, congeners, among, the, gnostic, tractates, another, work, circulating, under, the, name, of, zoroaster, was, the, asteroskopita, or, apotelesmatika, and, which, ran, to, five, volumes, i, e, papyrus, rolls, the, title, and, fragments, suggest, that, it, was, an, astrological, handbook, albeit, a, very, varied, one, for, the, making, of, predictions, a, third, text, attributed, to, zoroaster, is, on, virtue, of, stones, peri, lithon, timion, of, which, nothing, is, known, other, than, its, extent, one, volume, and, that, pseudo, zoroaster, sang, it, from, which, cumont, and, bidez, conclude, that, it, was, in, verse, numerous, other, fragments, preserved, in, the, works, of, other, authors, are, attributed, to, zoroaster, but, the, titles, of, those, books, are, not, mentioned, these, pseudepigraphic, texts, aside, some, authors, did, draw, on, a, few, genuinely, zoroastrian, ideas, the, oracles, of, hystaspes, by, hystaspes, another, prominent, magian, pseudo, author, is, a, set, of, prophecies, distinguished, from, other, zoroastrian, pseudepigrapha, in, that, it, draws, on, real, zoroastrian, sources, some, allusions, are, more, difficult, to, assess, in, the, same, text, that, attributes, the, invention, of, magic, to, zoroaster, pliny, states, that, zoroaster, laughed, on, the, day, of, his, birth, although, in, an, earlier, place, pliny, had, sworn, in, the, name, of, hercules, that, no, child, had, ever, done, so, before, the, 40th, day, from, his, birth, this, notion, of, zoroaster, s, laughter, also, appears, in, the, 9th, to, 11th, century, texts, of, genuine, zoroastrian, tradition, and, for, a, time, it, was, assumed, that, the, origin, of, those, myths, lay, with, indigenous, sources, pliny, also, records, that, zoroaster, s, head, had, pulsated, so, strongly, that, it, repelled, the, hand, when, laid, upon, it, a, presage, of, his, future, wisdom, the, iranians, were, however, just, as, familiar, with, the, greek, writers, and, the, provenance, of, other, descriptions, are, clear, for, instance, plutarch, s, description, of, its, dualistic, theologies, reads, thus, others, call, the, better, of, these, a, god, and, his, rival, a, daemon, as, for, example, zoroaster, the, magus, who, lived, so, they, record, five, thousand, years, before, the, siege, of, troy, he, used, to, call, the, one, horomazes, and, the, other, areimanius, an, early, reference, to, zoroaster, in, english, literature, occur, in, the, writings, of, the, physician, philosopher, sir, thomas, browne, who, asserted, in, his, religio, medici, 1643, i, believe, besides, zoroaster, there, were, divers, that, writ, before, moses, who, notwithstanding, have, suffered, the, common, fate, of, time, in, e, t, a, hoffmann, s, novel, klein, zaches, genannt, zinnober, 1819, the, mage, prosper, alpanus, states, that, professor, zoroaster, was, his, teacher, in, his, seminal, work, thus, spoke, zarathustra, 1885, the, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, uses, the, native, iranian, name, zarathustra, which, has, a, significant, meaning, as, he, had, used, the, familiar, greek, latin, name, in, his, earlier, works, it, is, believed, that, nietzsche, invents, a, characterization, of, zarathustra, as, the, mouthpiece, for, nietzsche, s, own, ideas, about, morality, by, choosing, the, name, of, zarathustra, as, prophet, of, his, philosophy, as, he, has, expressed, clearly, he, followed, the, paradoxical, aim, of, paying, homage, to, the, original, iranian, prophet, and, reversing, his, teachings, at, the, same, time, the, original, zoroastrian, world, view, interprets, being, essentially, on, a, moralistic, basis, and, depicts, the, world, as, an, arena, for, the, struggle, of, the, two, fundamentals, of, being, good, and, evil, represented, in, two, antagonistic, divine, figures, on, the, contrary, nietzsche, wants, his, philosophy, to, be, beyond, good, and, evil, the, german, composer, richard, strauss, s, large, scale, tone, poem, also, sprach, zarathustra, 1896, was, inspired, by, nietzsche, s, book, a, sculpture,
