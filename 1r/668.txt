political, alliance, known, as, the, first, triumvirate, together, the, three, men, dominated, the, roman, political, system, but, the, alliance, did, not, last, long, due, to, the, ambitions, egos, and, jealousies, of, the, three, men, while, caesar, and, crassus, were, lifelong, allies, crassus, and, pompey, disliked, each, other, and, pompey, grew, increasingly, envious, of, caesar, s, spectacular, successes, in, the, gallic, wars, the, alliance, was, restabilized, at, the, luca, conference, in, 56, bc, after, which, crassus, and, pompey, again, served, jointly, as, consuls,

unraveled, the, alliance, between, caesar, and, pompey, since, his, political, influence, and, wealth, had, been, a, counterbalance, to, the, two, greater, militarists, within, four, years, of, crassus, death, caesar, crossed, the, rubicon, and, began, a, civil, war, against, pompey, and, the, optimates, marcus, licinius, crassus, was, a, member, of, the, gens, licinia, an, old, and, highly, respected, plebeian, family, in, rome, he, was, the, second, of, three, sons, born, to, the, eminent, senator, and, vir, triumphalis, publius, licinius, crassus, consul, 95, bc, censor, 89, bc, this, line, was, not, descended, from, the, wealthy, crassi, divites, although, often, assumed, to, be, the, eldest, brother, publius, born, c, 116, bc, died, shortly, before, the, italic, war, and, crassus, father, and, younger, brother, were, either, slain, or, took, their, own, lives, in, rome, in, winter, 87, 86, bc, when, being, hunted, down, by, the, supporters, of, gaius, marius, following, their, victory, in, the, bellum, octavianum, crassus, had, the, unusual, distinction, of, marrying, his, wife, tertulla, after, she, had, been, widowed, by, his, brother, there, were, three, main, branches, of, the, house, of, the, licinii, crassi, in, the, 2nd, and, 1st, centuries, bc, and, many, mistakes, in, identifications, and, lines, have, arisen, owing, to, the, uniformity, of, roman, nomenclature, erroneous, modern, suppositions, and, the, unevenness, of, information, across, the, generations, in, addition, the, dives, cognomen, of, the, crassi, divites, means, rich, or, wealthy, and, since, marcus, crassus, the, subject, here, was, renowned, for, his, enormous, wealth, this, has, contributed, to, hasty, assumptions, that, his, family, belonged, to, the, divites, but, no, ancient, source, accords, him, or, his, father, the, dives, cognomen, plutarch, says, his, great, wealth, was, acquired, rather, than, inherited, and, that, he, was, raised, in, modest, circumstances, crassus, grandfather, of, the, same, name, marcus, licinius, crassus, praetor, c, 126, bc, was, facetiously, given, the, greek, nickname, agelastus, the, unlaughing, or, grim, by, his, contemporary, gaius, lucilius, the, inventor, of, roman, satire, who, asserted, that, he, smiled, once, in, his, whole, life, this, grandfather, was, son, of, publius, licinius, crassus, the, latter, s, brother, gaius, licinius, crassus, consul, 168, bc, produced, the, third, line, of, licinii, crassi, of, the, period, the, most, famous, of, whom, was, lucius, licinius, crassus, the, greatest, roman, orator, before, cicero, and, the, latter, s, childhood, hero, and, model, marcus, crassus, was, also, a, talented, orator, and, one, of, the, most, energetic, and, active, advocates, of, his, time, after, the, marian, purges, and, the, subsequent, sudden, death, of, gaius, marius, the, surviving, consul, lucius, cornelius, cinna, father, in, law, of, julius, caesar, imposed, proscriptions, on, those, surviving, roman, senators, and, equestrians, who, had, supported, lucius, cornelius, sulla, in, his, 88, bc, march, on, rome, and, overthrow, of, the, traditional, roman, political, arrangements, cinna, s, proscription, forced, crassus, to, flee, to, hispania, he, stayed, in, spain, from, 87, to, 84, bc, here, he, recruited, 2, 500, men, an, understrength, legion, from, his, father, s, clients, settled, in, the, area, crassus, used, his, army, to, extort, money, from, the, local, cities, to, pay, for, his, campaigns, even, being, accused, of, sacking, malaca, after, cinna, s, death, in, 84, bc, crassus, went, to, the, roman, province, of, africa, and, joined, metellus, pius, one, of, sulla, s, closest, allies, but, did, not, stay, there, for, long, because, of, disagreements, with, metellus, he, sailed, his, army, to, greece, and, joined, sulla, with, whom, he, stood, in, a, position, of, special, honor, during, sulla, s, civil, war, crassus, and, pompey, fought, a, battle, in, the, plain, of, spoletium, spoleto, killed, about, 3, 000, of, the, men, of, papirius, carbo, the, leader, of, the, marian, forces, and, besieged, carrinas, a, marian, commander, during, the, decisive, battle, of, the, colline, gate, crassus, commanded, the, right, flank, of, sulla, s, army, after, almost, a, day, of, fighting, the, battle, was, going, poorly, for, sulla, his, own, center, was, being, pushed, back, and, was, on, the, verge, of, collapse, when, he, got, word, from, crassus, that, he, had, comprehensively, crushed, the, enemy, before, him, crassus, wanted, to, know, whether, sulla, needed, assistance, or, whether, his, men, could, retire, sulla, told, him, to, advance, on, the, enemy, s, center, and, used, the, news, of, crassus, success, to, stiffen, the, resolve, of, his, own, troops, by, the, following, morning, the, battle, was, over, and, the, sullan, army, emerged, victorious, making, sulla, the, master, of, rome, sulla, s, victory, and, crassus, contribution, to, it, put, crassus, in, a, key, position, sulla, was, as, loyal, to, his, allies, as, he, was, cruel, towards, his, enemies, and, crassus, had, been, a, very, loyal, ally, marcus, licinius, crassus, next, concern, was, to, rebuild, the, fortunes, of, his, family, which, had, been, confiscated, during, the, marian, cinnan, proscriptions, sulla, s, proscriptions, in, which, the, property, of, his, victims, was, cheaply, auctioned, off, found, one, of, the, greatest, acquirers, of, this, type, of, property, in, crassus, indeed, sulla, was, especially, supportive, of, this, because, he, wished, to, spread, the, blame, as, much, as, possible, among, those, unscrupulous, enough, to, do, so, sulla, s, proscriptions, ensured, that, his, survivors, would, recoup, their, lost, fortunes, from, the, fortunes, of, wealthy, adherents, to, gaius, marius, or, lucius, cornelius, cinna, proscriptions, meant, that, their, political, enemies, lost, their, fortunes, and, their, lives, that, their, female, relatives, notably, widows, and, widowed, daughters, were, forbidden, to, marry, remarry, or, remain, married, and, that, in, some, cases, their, families, hopes, of, rebuilding, their, fortunes, and, political, significance, were, destroyed, crassus, is, said, to, have, made, part, of, his, money, from, proscriptions, notably, the, proscription, of, one, man, whose, name, was, not, initially, on, the, list, of, those, proscribed, but, was, added, by, crassus, who, coveted, the, man, s, fortune, crassus, wealth, is, estimated, by, pliny, at, approximately, 200, million, sesterces, plutarch, in, his, life, of, crassus, says, the, wealth, of, crassus, increased, from, less, than, 300, talents, at, first, to, 7, 100, talents, this, represented, 229, tonnes, of, silver, worth, about, us, 167, 4, million, at, august, 2023, silver, prices, accounted, right, before, his, parthian, expedition, most, of, which, plutarch, declares, crassus, got, by, fire, and, war, making, the, public, calamities, his, greatest, source, of, revenue, some, of, crassus, wealth, was, acquired, conventionally, through, slave, trafficking, production, from, silver, mines, and, speculative, real, estate, purchases, crassus, bought, property, that, was, confiscated, in, proscriptions, and, by, notoriously, purchasing, burnt, and, collapsed, buildings, plutarch, wrote, that, observing, how, frequent, such, occurrences, were, he, bought, slaves, who, were, architects, and, builders, when, he, had, over, 500, slaves, he, bought, houses, that, had, burnt, and, the, adjacent, ones, because, their, owners, would, let, go, at, a, trifling, price, he, bought, the, largest, part, of, rome, in, this, way, buying, them, on, the, cheap, and, rebuilding, them, with, slave, labor, the, first, ever, roman, fire, brigade, was, created, by, crassus, fires, were, almost, a, daily, occurrence, in, rome, and, crassus, took, advantage, of, the, fact, that, rome, had, no, fire, department, by, creating, his, own, brigade, 500, men, strong, which, rushed, to, burning, buildings, at, the, first, cry, of, alarm, upon, arriving, at, the, scene, however, the, firefighters, did, nothing, while, crassus, offered, to, buy, the, burning, building, from, the, distressed, property, owner, at, a, miserable, price, if, the, owner, agreed, to, sell, the, property, his, men, would, put, out, the, fire, if, the, owner, refused, then, they, would, simply, let, the, structure, burn, to, the, ground, after, buying, many, properties, this, way, he, rebuilt, them, and, often, leased, the, properties, to, their, original, owners, or, new, tenants, crassus, befriended, licinia, a, vestal, virgin, whose, valuable, property, he, coveted, plutarch, says, and, yet, when, he, was, further, on, in, years, he, was, accused, of, criminal, intimacy, with, licinia, one, of, the, vestal, virgins, and, licinia, was, formally, prosecuted, by, a, certain, plotius, now, licinia, was, the, owner, of, a, pleasant, villa, in, the, suburbs, which, crassus, wished, to, get, at, a, low, price, and, it, was, for, this, reason, that, he, was, forever, hovering, about, the, woman, and, paying, his, court, to, her, until, he, fell, under, the, abominable, suspicion, and, in, a, way, it, was, his, avarice, that, absolved, him, from, the, charge, of, corrupting, the, vestal, and, he, was, acquitted, by, the, judges, but, he, did, not, let, licinia, go, until, he, had, acquired, her, property, despite, his, great, wealth, crassus, is, said, to, have, avoided, excess, and, luxury, at, home, family, meals, were, simple, and, entertaining, was, generous, but, not, ostentatious, crassus, chose, his, companions, during, leisure, hours, on, the, basis, of, personal, friendship, as, well, as, political, utility, although, the, crassi, as, noble, plebeians, would, have, displayed, ancestral, images, in, their, atrium, they, did, not, lay, claim, to, a, fictionalized, genealogy, that, presumed, divine, or, legendary, ancestors, a, practice, not, uncommon, among, the, roman, nobility, after, rebuilding, his, fortune, crassus, next, concern, was, his, political, career, as, a, wealthy, man, in, rome, an, adherent, of, sulla, and, a, man, who, hailed, from, a, line, of, consuls, and, praetors, crassus, political, future, was, apparently, assured, his, problem, was, that, despite, his, military, successes, he, was, eclipsed, by, his, contemporary, pompey, the, great, crassus, rivalry, with, pompey, and, his, envy, of, pompey, s, triumph, would, influence, his, subsequent, career, crassus, was, elected, praetor, in, 73, bc, and, pursued, the, cursus, honorum, during, the, third, servile, war, or, spartacus, revolt, 73, 71, bc, crassus, offered, to, equip, train, and, lead, new, troops, at, his, own, expense, after, several, legions, had, been, defeated, and, their, commanders, killed, in, battle, crassus, was, sent, into, battle, against, spartacus, by, the, senate, at, first, he, had, trouble, both, in, anticipating, spartacus, moves, and, in, inspiring, his, army, to, strengthen, their, morale, when, a, segment, of, his, army, fled, from, battle, abandoning, their, weapons, crassus, revived, the, ancient, practice, of, decimation, i, e, executing, one, out, of, every, ten, men, with, the, victims, selected, by, drawing, lots, plutarch, reports, that, many, things, horrible, and, dreadful, to, see, occurred, during, the, infliction, of, punishment, which, was, witnessed, by, the, rest, of, crassus, army, nevertheless, according, to, appian, the, troops, fighting, spirit, improved, dramatically, thereafter, since, crassus, had, demonstrated, that, he, was, more, dangerous, to, them, than, the, enemy, afterwards, when, spartacus, retreated, to, the, bruttium, peninsula, in, the, southwest, of, italy, crassus, tried, to, pen, up, the, slave, armies, by, building, a, ditch, and, a, rampart, across, the, peninsula, of, rhegium, in, bruttium, from, sea, to, sea, despite, this, remarkable, feat, spartacus, and, part, of, his, army, still, managed, to, break, out, on, the, night, of, a, heavy, snowstorm, they, sneaked, through, crassus, lines, and, made, a, bridge, of, dirt, and, tree, branches, over, the, ditch, thus, escaping, some, time, later, when, the, roman, armies, led, by, pompey, and, varro, lucullus, were, recalled, to, italy, in, support, of, crassus, spartacus, decided, to, fight, rather, than, find, himself, and, his, followers, trapped, between, three, armies, two, of, them, returning, from, overseas, action, in, this, last, battle, the, battle, of, the, silarius, river, crassus, gained, a, decisive, victory, and, captured, six, thousand, slaves, alive, during, the, fighting, spartacus, attempted, to, personally, kill, crassus, slaughtering, his, way, toward, the, general, s, position, but, he, succeeded, only, in, killing, two, of, the, centurions, guarding, crassus, spartacus, himself, is, believed, to, have, been, killed, in, the, battle, although, his, body, was, never, recovered, the, six, thousand, captured, slaves, were, crucified, along, the, via, appia, by, crassus, orders, at, his, command, their, bodies, were, not, taken, down, afterwards, but, remained, rotting, along, rome, s, principal, route, to, the, south, this, was, intended, as, an, abject, lesson, to, anyone, who, might, think, of, rebelling, against, rome, in, the, future, particularly, of, slave, insurrections, against, their, owners, and, masters, the, roman, citizens, crassus, effectively, ended, the, third, servile, war, in, 71, bc, in, plutarch, s, account, crassus, had, written, to, the, senate, that, they, must, summon, lucullus, from, thrace, and, pompey, from, spain, but, he, was, sorry, now, that, he, had, done, so, and, was, eager, to, bring, the, war, to, an, end, before, those, generals, came, he, knew, that, the, success, would, be, ascribed, to, the, one, who, came, up, with, assistance, and, not, to, himself, he, decided, to, attack, a, splinter, group, of, rebels, and, after, this, spartacus, withdrew, to, the, mountains, pompey, had, arrived, from, hispania, with, his, veterans, and, was, sent, to, provide, reinforcements, crassus, hurried, to, seek, the, final, battle, which, he, won, pompey, arrived, in, time, to, deal, with, the, disorganized, and, defeated, fugitives, writing, to, the, senate, that, indeed, crassus, had, conquered, the, slaves, but, that, he, himself, had, extirpated, the, war, crassus, for, all, his, self, approval, did, not, venture, to, ask, for, the, major, triumph, and, it, was, thought, ignoble, and, mean, in, him, to, celebrate, even, the, minor, triumph, on, foot, called, the, ovation, nor, did, he, wish, to, be, honored, for, subduing, slaves, in, plutarch, s, account, pompey, was, asked, to, stand, for, the, consulship, crassus, wanted, to, become, his, colleague, and, asked, pompey, for, his, assistance, as, said, in, the, life, of, crassus, pompey, received, his, request, gladly, for, he, was, desirous, of, having, crassus, in, some, way, or, other, always, in, debt, to, him, for, some, favor, eagerly, promoted, his, candidature, and, finally, said, in, a, speech, to, the, assembly, that, he, should, be, no, less, grateful, to, them, for, the, colleague, than, for, the, office, which, he, desired, however, in, office, they, did, not, remain, friendly, they, differed, on, almost, every, measure, and, by, their, contentiousness, rendered, their, consulship, barren, politically, and, without, achievement, crassus, displayed, his, wealth, by, realizing, public, sacrifices, to, hercules, entertaining, the, populace, at, 10, 000, tables, and, distributing, sufficient, grain, to, last, each, family, three, months, an, act, that, had, the, additional, ends, of, performing, a, previously, made, religious, vow, of, a, tithe, to, the, demigod, hercules, and, also, to, gain, support, among, the, members, of, the, popular, party, in, appian, s, account, when, crassus, ended, the, rebellion, there, was, a, contention, over, honors, between, him, and, pompey, neither, men, dismissed, their, armies, with, both, being, candidates, for, the, consulship, crassus, had, been, praetor, as, the, law, of, sulla, required, pompey, had, been, neither, praetor, nor, quaestor, and, was, only, 34, years, old, but, he, had, promised, the, plebeian, tribunes, to, restore, much, of, their, power, that, had, been, taken, away, by, sulla, s, constitutional, reforms, even, when, they, were, both, chosen, consuls, they, did, not, dismiss, their, armies, stationed, near, the, city, pompey, said, that, he, was, awaiting, the, return, of, metellus, for, his, spanish, triumph, crassus, said, that, pompey, ought, to, dismiss, his, army, first, in, the, end, crassus, yielded, first, offering, pompey, his, hand, in, 65, bc, crassus, was, elected, censor, with, another, conservative, quintus, lutatius, catulus, capitolinus, himself, son, of, a, consul, during, that, decade, crassus, was, julius, caesar, s, patron, in, all, but, name, financing, caesar, s, successful, election, to, become, pontifex, maximus, caesar, had, formerly, been, the, priest, of, jupiter, or, flamen, dialis, but, had, been, deprived, of, office, by, sulla, crassus, also, supported, caesar, s, efforts, to, win, command, of, military, campaigns, caesar, s, mediation, between, crassus, and, pompey, led, to, the, creation, of, the, first, triumvirate, in, 60, bc, consisting, of, crassus, pompey, and, caesar, who, became, consul, in, 59, bc, this, coalition, would, last, until, crassus, death, in, 54, bc, crassus, looted, the, jewish, temple, treasury, in, 55, bc, after, the, triumvirate, met, at, the, luca, conference, in, 56, bc, crassus, was, again, consul, with, pompey, and, a, law, was, passed, assigning, the, provinces, of, the, two, hispanias, and, syria, to, pompey, and, crassus, respectively, for, five, years, crassus, received, syria, as, his, province, which, promised, to, be, an, inexhaustible, source, of, wealth, it, might, have, been, had, he, not, also, sought, military, glory, and, crossed, the, euphrates, in, an, attempt, to, conquer, parthia, crassus, attacked, parthia, not, only, because, of, its, great, source, of, riches, but, because, of, a, desire, to, match, the, military, victories, of, pompey, and, caesar, the, king, of, armenia, artavasdes, ii, offered, crassus, the, aid, of, nearly, 40, 000, troops, 10, 000, cataphracts, and, 30, 000, infantrymen, on, the, condition, that, crassus, invade, through, armenia, so, that, the, king, could, not, only, maintain, the, upkeep, of, his, own, troops, but, also, provide, a, safer, route, for, his, men, and, crassus, crassus, refused, and, chose, the, more, direct, route, by, crossing, the, euphrates, as, he, had, done, in, his, successful, campaign, in, the, previous, year, crassus, received, directions, from, the, osroene, chieftain, ariamnes, who, had, previously, assisted, pompey, in, his, eastern, campaigns, ariamnes, was, in, the, pay, of, the, parthians, and, urged, crassus, to, attack, at, once, falsely, stating, that, the, parthians, were, weak, and, disorganized, he, then, led, crassus, army, into, desolate, desert, far, from, any, water, in, 53, bc, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, modern, harran, in, turkey, crassus, legions, were, defeated, by, a, numerically, inferior, parthian, force, crassus, legions, were, primarily, heavy, infantry, but, were, not, prepared, for, the, type, of, swift, cavalry, and, arrow, attack, in, which, parthian, troops, were, particularly, adept, the, parthian, horse, archers, devastated, the, unprepared, romans, with, hit, and, run, techniques, and, feigned, retreats, with, the, ability, to, shoot, as, well, backwards, as, they, could, forwards, crassus, refused, his, quaestor, gaius, cassius, longinus, plans, to, reconstitute, the, roman, battle, line, and, remained, in, the, testudo, formation, to, protect, his, flanks, until, the, parthians, eventually, ran, out, of, arrows, however, the, parthians, had, stationed, camels, carrying, arrows, to, allow, their, archers, to, continually, reload, and, relentlessly, barrage, the, romans, until, dusk, despite, taking, severe, casualties, the, romans, successfully, retreated, to, carrhae, forced, to, leave, many, wounded, behind, to, be, later, slaughtered, by, the, parthians, subsequently, crassus, men, being, near, mutiny, demanded, he, parley, with, the, parthians, who, had, offered, to, meet, with, him, crassus, despondent, at, the, death, of, his, son, publius, in, the, battle, finally, agreed, to, meet, the, parthian, general, surena, however, when, crassus, mounted, a, horse, to, ride, to, the, parthian, camp, for, a, peace, negotiation, his, junior, officer, octavius, suspected, a, parthian, trap, and, grabbed, crassus, horse, by, the, bridle, instigating, a, sudden, fight, with, the, parthians, that, left, the, roman, party, dead, including, crassus, a, story, later, emerged, to, the, effect, that, after, crassus, death, the, parthians, poured, molten, gold, into, his, mouth, in, a, symbolic, mockery, of, his, thirst, for, wealth, the, account, given, in, plutarch, s, biography, of, crassus, also, mentions, that, during, the, feasting, and, revelry, in, the, wedding, ceremony, of, artavasdes, sister, to, the, parthian, king, orodes, ii, s, son, and, heir, pacorus, in, the, armenian, capital, of, artashat, crassus, head, was, brought, to, orodes, ii, both, kings, were, enjoying, a, performance, of, euripides, greek, tragedy, the, bacchae, when, a, certain, actor, of, the, royal, court, named, jason, of, tralles, took, the, head, and, sang, the, following, verses, also, from, the, bacchae, we, bring, from, the, mountain, a, tendril, fresh, cut, to, the, palace, a, wonderful, prey, crassus, head, was, thus, used, in, place, of, a, prop, head, representing, pentheus, and, carried, by, the, character, of, agave, also, according, to, plutarch, a, final, mockery, was, made, ridiculing, the, memory, of, crassus, by, dressing, up, a, roman, prisoner, caius, paccianus, who, resembled, him, in, appearance, in, women, s, clothing, calling, him, crassus, and, imperator, and, leading, him, in, a, spectacular, show, of, a, final, mock, triumphal, procession, putting, to, ridiculous, use, the, traditional, symbols, of, roman, triumph, and, authority, film, television
