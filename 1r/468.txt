it, incorporated, italian, and, french, elements, generally, considered, among, the, greatest, english, opera, composers, purcell, has, been, assessed, with, john, dunstaple, and, william, byrd, as, england, s, most, important, early, music, composer, purcell, was, born, in, st, ann, s, lane, old, pye, street, westminster, in, 1659, henry, purcell, senior, whose, older, brother, thomas, purcell,

daniel, purcell, the, youngest, of, the, brothers, was, also, a, prolific, composer, who, wrote, the, music, for, much, of, the, final, act, of, the, indian, queen, after, his, brother, henry, s, death, the, family, lived, just, a, few, hundred, yards, west, of, westminster, abbey, from, 1659, onwards, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1664, purcell, was, placed, under, the, guardianship, of, his, uncle, thomas, who, showed, him, great, affection, and, kindness, thomas, arranged, for, henry, to, be, admitted, as, a, chorister, henry, studied, first, under, captain, henry, cooke, master,

semi, operas, probably, also, had, a, musical, influence, on, the, young, purcell, henry, was, a, chorister, in, the, chapel, royal, until, his, voice, broke, in, 1673, when, he, became, assistant, to, the, organ, builder, john, hingston, who, held, the, post, of, keeper, of, wind, instruments, to, the, king, purcell, is, said, to, have, been, composing, at, nine, years, old, but, the, earliest, work, that, can, be, certainly, identified, as, his, is, an, ode, for, the, king, s, birthday, written, in, 1670, when, he, was, eleven, the, dates, for, his, compositions, are, often, uncertain, despite, considerable, research, it, is, assumed, that, the, three, part, song, sweet, tyranness, i, now, resign, was, written, by, him, as, a, child, after, humfrey, s, death, purcell, continued, his, studies, under, john, blow, he, attended, westminster, school, and, in, 1676, was, appointed, copyist, at, westminster, abbey, henry, purcell, s, earliest, anthem, lord, who, can, tell, was, composed, in, 1678, it, is, a, psalm, that, is, prescribed, for, christmas, day, and, also, to, be, read, at, morning, prayer, on, the, fourth, day, of, the, month, in, 1679, he, wrote, songs, for, john, playford, s, choice, ayres, songs, and, dialogues, and, an, anthem, the, name, of, which, is, unknown, for, the, chapel, royal, from, an, extant, letter, written, by, thomas, purcell, we, learn, that, this, anthem, was, composed, for, the, exceptionally, fine, voice, of, the, rev, john, gostling, then, at, canterbury, but, afterwards, a, gentleman, of, his, majesty, s, chapel, purcell, wrote, several, anthems, at, different, times, for, gostling, s, extraordinary, basso, profondo, voice, which, is, known, to, have, had, a, range, of, at, least, two, full, octaves, from, d, below, the, bass, staff, to, the, d, above, it, the, dates, of, very, few, of, these, sacred, compositions, are, known, perhaps, the, most, notable, example, is, the, anthem, they, that, go, down, to, the, sea, in, ships, in, gratitude, for, the, providential, escape, of, king, charles, ii, from, shipwreck, gostling, who, had, been, of, the, royal, party, put, together, some, verses, from, the, psalms, in, the, form, of, an, anthem, and, requested, purcell, to, set, them, to, music, the, challenging, work, opens, with, a, passage, which, traverses, the, full, extent, of, gostling, s, range, beginning, on, the, upper, d, and, descending, two, octaves, to, the, lower, between, 1680, and, 1688, purcell, wrote, music, for, seven, plays, the, composition, of, his, chamber, opera, dido, and, aeneas, which, forms, a, very, important, landmark, in, the, history, of, english, dramatic, music, has, been, attributed, to, this, period, and, its, earliest, production, may, well, have, predated, the, documented, one, of, 1689, it, was, written, to, a, libretto, furnished, by, nahum, tate, and, performed, in, 1689, in, cooperation, with, josias, priest, a, dancing, master, and, the, choreographer, for, the, dorset, garden, theatre, priest, s, wife, kept, a, boarding, school, for, young, gentlewomen, first, in, leicester, fields, and, afterwards, at, chelsea, where, the, opera, was, performed, it, is, occasionally, considered, the, first, genuine, english, opera, though, that, title, is, usually, given, to, blow, s, venus, and, adonis, as, in, blow, s, work, the, action, does, not, progress, in, spoken, dialogue, but, in, italian, style, recitative, each, work, runs, to, less, than, one, hour, at, the, time, dido, and, aeneas, never, found, its, way, to, the, theatre, though, it, appears, to, have, been, very, popular, in, private, circles, it, is, believed, to, have, been, extensively, copied, but, only, one, song, was, printed, by, purcell, s, widow, in, orpheus, britannicus, and, the, complete, work, remained, in, manuscript, until, 1840, when, it, was, printed, by, the, musical, antiquarian, society, under, the, editorship, of, sir, george, macfarren, the, composition, of, dido, and, aeneas, gave, purcell, his, first, chance, to, write, a, sustained, musical, setting, of, a, dramatic, text, it, was, his, only, opportunity, to, compose, a, work, in, which, the, music, carried, the, entire, drama, the, story, of, dido, and, aeneas, derives, from, the, original, source, in, virgil, s, epic, the, aeneid, during, the, early, part, of, 1679, he,

westminster, abbey, 10, years, before, resigned, his, office, in, favour, of, purcell, purcell, now, devoted, himself, almost, entirely, to, the, composition, of, sacred, music, and, for, six, years, severed, his, connection, with, the, theatre, he, had, probably, written, his, two, important, stage, works, before, taking, up, his, new, office, soon, after, purcell, s, marriage, in, 1682, on, the,

connection, with, the, theatre, by, furnishing, the, music, for, john, dryden, s, tragedy, tyrannick, love, in, this, year, purcell, also, composed, a, march, and, passepied, called, quick, step, which, became, so, popular, that, lord, wharton, adapted, the, latter, to, the, verses, of, lillibullero, in, or, before, january, 1688, purcell, composed, his, anthem, blessed, are, they, that, fear,
