institution, over, which, he, did, not, have, firm, control, he, replaced, the, chief, of, staff, with, a, more, reliable, officer, and, then, proceeded, to, create, his, own, power, base, within,

the, macoute, which, by, 1961, was, twice, as, big, as, the, army, never, developed, into, a, real, military, force, but, was, more, than, just, a, secret, police, in, the, early, years, of, his, rule, duvalier, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, strategic, weaknesses, of, his, powerful, opponents, mostly, from, the, mulatto, elite, these, weaknesses, included, their, inability, to, coordinate, their, actions, against, the, regime, whose, power, had, grown, increasingly, stronger, in, the, name, of, nationalism, duvalier, expelled, almost, all, of, haiti, s, foreign, born,

which, he, was, the, sole, candidate, though, his, term, was, to, expire, in, 1963, and, the, constitution, prohibited, re, election, the, election, was, flagrantly, rigged, the, official, tally, showed, a, total, of, 1, 320, 748, yes, votes, for, another, term, for, duvalier, with, none, opposed, upon, hearing, the, results, he, proclaimed, i, accept, the, people, s, will, as, a, revolutionary, i, have, no, right, to, disregard, the, will, of, the, people, 85, the, new, york, times, commented, latin, america, has, witnessed, many, fraudulent, elections, throughout, its,

a, title, previously, held, by, seven, haitian, presidents, this, referendum, was, also, blatantly, rigged, an, implausible, 99, 9, voted, in, favor, which, should, have, come, as, no, surprise, since, all, the, ballots, were, premarked, yes, 96, 97, the, new, document, granted, duvalier, or, le, souverain, as, he, was, called, absolute, powers, as, well, as, the, right, to, name, his,
