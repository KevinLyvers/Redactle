hitler, on, 20, july, 1934, himmler, s, title, of, reichsf, hrer, ss, became, the, highest, formal, ss, rank, equivalent, to, a, field, marshal, in, the, army, the, sa, was, converted, into, a, sports, and, training, organisation, on, 15, september, 1935, hitler, presented, two, laws, known, as, the, nuremberg, laws, to, the, reichstag, the, laws, banned, marriage, between, non, jewish, and,

german, citizenship, these, laws, were, among, the, first, race, based, measures, instituted, by, the, third, reich, himmler, and, heydrich, wanted, to, extend, the, power, of, the, ss, thus, they, urged, hitler, to, form, a, national, police, force, overseen, by, the, ss, to, guard, nazi, germany, against, its, many, enemies, at, the, time, real, and, imagined, interior, minister, frick, also, wanted, a, national, police, force, but, one, controlled, by, him, with, kurt, daluege, as, his, police, chief, hitler, left, it, to, himmler, and, heydrich, to, work, out, the, arrangements, with, frick, himmler, and, heydrich, had, greater, bargaining, power, as, they, were, allied, with, frick, s, old, enemy, g, ring, heydrich, drew, up, a, set, of, proposals, and, himmler, sent, him, to, meet, with, frick, an, angry, frick, then, consulted, with, hitler, who, told, him, to, agree, to, the, proposals, frick, acquiesced, and, on, 17, june, 1936, hitler, decreed, the, unification, of, all, police, forces, in, the, reich, and, named, himmler, chief, of, german, police, and, a, state, secretary, in, the, ministry, of, the, interior, in, this, role, himmler, was, still, nominally, subordinate, to, frick, in, practice, however, the, police, were, now, effectively, a, division, of, the, ss, and, hence, independent, of, frick, s, control, this, move, gave, himmler, operational, control, over, germany, s, entire, detective, force, he, also, gained, authority, over, all, of, germany, s, uniformed, law, enforcement, agencies, which, were, amalgamated, into, the, new, ordnungspolizei, orpo, order, police, which, became, a, branch, of, the, ss, under, daluege, shortly, thereafter, himmler, created, the, kriminalpolizei, kripo, criminal, police, as, an, umbrella,

verf, gungstruppe, ss, vt, which, later, evolved, into, the, waffen, ss, nominally, under, the, authority, of, himmler, the, waffen, ss, developed, a, fully, militarised, structure, of, command, and, operations, it, grew, from, three, regiments, to, over, 38, divisions, during, world, war, ii, serving, alongside, the, heer, army, but, never, being, formally, part, of, it, in, addition, to, his, military, ambitions, himmler, established, the, beginnings, of, a, parallel, economy, under, the, umbrella, of, the, ss, to, this, end, administrator, oswald, pohl, set, up, the, deutsche, wirtschaftsbetriebe, german, economic, enterprise, in, 1940, under, the, auspices, of, the, ss, economy, and, administration, head, office, this, holding, company, owned, housing, corporations, factories, and, publishing, houses, pohl, was, unscrupulous, and, quickly, exploited, the, companies, for, personal, gain, in, contrast, himmler, was, honest, in, matters, of, money, and, business, in, 1938, as, part, of, his, preparations, for, war, hitler, ended, the, german, alliance, with, china, and, entered, into, an, agreement, with, the, more, modern, japan, that, same, year, austria, was, unified, with, nazi, germany, in, the, anschluss, and, the, munich, agreement, gave, nazi, germany, control, over, the, sudetenland, part, of, czechoslovakia, hitler, s, primary, motivations, for, war, included, obtaining, additional, lebensraum, living, space, for, the, germanic, peoples, who, were, considered, racially, superior, according, to, nazi, ideology, a, second, goal, was, the, elimination, of, those, considered, racially, inferior, particularly, the, jews, and, slavs, from, territories, controlled, by, the, reich, from, 1933, to, 1938, hundreds, of, thousands, of, jews, emigrated, to, the, united, states, palestine, great, britain, and, other, countries, some, converted, to, christianity, according, to, himmler, biographer, peter, longerich, himmler, believed, that, a, major, task, of, the, ss, should, be, acting, as, the, vanguard, in, overcoming, christianity, and, restoring, a, germanic, way, of, living, as, part, of, preparations, for, the, coming, conflict, between, humans, and, subhumans, longerich, wrote, that, while, the, nazi, movement, as, a, whole, launched, itself, against, jews, and, communists, by, linking, de, christianisation, with, re, germanization, himmler, had, provided, the, ss, with, a, goal, and, purpose, all, of, its, own, himmler, was, vehemently, opposed, to, christian, sexual, morality, and, the, principle, of, christian, mercy, both, of, which, he, saw, as, dangerous, obstacles, to, his, planned, battle, with, subhumans, in, 1937, himmler, declared, we, live, in, an, era, of, the, ultimate, conflict, with, christianity, it, is, part, of, the, mission, of, the, ss, to, give, the, german, people, in, the, next, half, century, the, non, christian, ideological, foundations, on, which, to, lead, and, shape, their, lives, this, task, does, not, consist, solely, in, overcoming, an, ideological, opponent, but, must, be, accompanied, at, every, step, by, a, positive, impetus, in, this, case, that, means, the, reconstruction, of, the, german, heritage, in, the, widest, and, most, comprehensive, sense, in, early, 1937, himmler, had, his, personal, staff, work, with, academics, to, create, a, framework, to, replace, christianity, within, the, germanic, cultural, heritage, the, project, gave, rise, to, the, deutschrechtliches, institut, headed, by, professor, karl, eckhardt, at, the, university, of, bonn, when, hitler, and, his, army, chiefs, asked, for, a, pretext, for, the, invasion, of, poland, in, 1939, himmler, heydrich, and, heinrich, m, ller, masterminded, and, carried, out, a, false, flag, project, code, named, operation, himmler, german, soldiers, dressed, in, polish, uniforms, undertook, border, skirmishes, which, deceptively, suggested, polish, aggression, against, germany, the, incidents, were, then, used, in, nazi, propaganda, to, justify, the, invasion, of, poland, the, opening, event, of, world, war, ii, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, against, poland, hitler, authorised, the, killing, of, polish, civilians, including, jews, and, ethnic, poles, the, einsatzgruppen, ss, task, forces, had, originally, been, formed, by, heydrich, to, secure, government, papers, and, offices, in, areas, taken, over, by, germany, before, world, war, ii, authorised, by, hitler, and, under, the, direction, of, himmler, and, heydrich, the, einsatzgruppen, units, now, repurposed, as, death, squads, followed, the, heer, army, into, poland, and, by, the, end, of, 1939, they, had, murdered, some, 65, 000, intellectuals, and, other, civilians, militias, and, heer, units, also, took, part, in, these, killings, under, himmler, s, orders, via, the, rsha, these, squads, were, also, tasked, with, rounding, up, jews, and, others, for, placement, in, ghettos, and, concentration, camps, germany, subsequently, invaded, denmark, and, norway, the, netherlands, and, france, and, began, bombing, great, britain, in, preparation, for, operation, sea, lion, the, planned, invasion, of, the, united, kingdom, on, 21, june, 1941, the, day, before, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, himmler, commissioned, the, preparation, of, the, generalplan, ost, general, plan, for, the, east, the, plan, was, approved, by, hitler, in, may, 1942, it, called, for, the, baltic, states, poland, western, ukraine, and, byelorussia, to, be, conquered, and, resettled, by, ten, million, german, citizens, the, current, residents, some, 31, million, people, would, be, expelled, further, east, starved, or, used, for, forced, labour, the, plan, would, have, extended, the, borders, of, germany, to, the, east, by, one, thousand, kilometres, 600, miles, himmler, expected, that, it, would, take, twenty, to, thirty, years, to, complete, the, plan, at, a, cost, of, 67, billion, himmler, stated, openly, it, is, a, question, of, existence, thus, it, will, be, a, racial, struggle, of, pitiless, severity, in, the, course, of, which, 20, to, 30, million, slavs, and, jews, will, perish, through, military, actions, and, crises, of, food, supply, himmler, declared, that, the, war, in, the, east, was, a, pan, european, crusade, to, defend, the, traditional, values, of, old, europe, from, the, godless, bolshevik, hordes, constantly, struggling, with, the, wehrmacht, for, recruits, himmler, solved, this, problem, through, the, creation, of, waffen, ss, units, composed, of, germanic, folk, groups, taken, from, the, balkans, and, eastern, europe, equally, vital, were, recruits, from, among, the, germanic, considered, peoples, of, northern, and, western, europe, in, the, netherlands, norway, belgium, denmark, and, finland, spain, and, italy, also, provided, men, for, waffen, ss, units, among, western, countries, the, number, of, volunteers, varied, from, a, high, of, 25, 000, from, the, netherlands, to, 300, each, from, sweden, and, switzerland, from, the, east, the, highest, number, of, men, came, from, lithuania, 50, 000, and, the, lowest, from, bulgaria, 600, after, 1943, most, men, from, the, east, were, conscripts, the, performance, of, the, eastern, waffen, ss, units, was, as, a, whole, sub, standard, in, late, 1941, hitler, named, heydrich, as, deputy, reich, protector, of, the, newly, established, protectorate, of, bohemia, and, moravia, heydrich, began, to, racially, classify, the, czechs, deporting, many, to, concentration, camps, members, of, a, swelling, resistance, were, shot, earning, heydrich, the, nickname, the, butcher, of, prague, this, appointment, strengthened, the, collaboration, between, himmler, and, heydrich, and, himmler, was, proud, to, have, ss, control, over, a, state, despite, having, direct, access, to, hitler, heydrich, s, loyalty, to, himmler, remained, firm, with, hitler, s, approval, himmler, re, established, the, einsatzgruppen, in, the, lead, up, to, the, planned, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, in, march, 1941, hitler, addressed, his, army, leaders, detailing, his, intention, to, smash, the, soviet, empire, and, destroy, the, bolshevik, intelligentsia, and, leadership, his, special, directive, the, guidelines, in, special, spheres, re, directive, no, 21, operation, barbarossa, read, in, the, operations, area, of, the, army, the, reichsf, hrer, ss, has, been, given, special, tasks, on, the, orders, of, the, f, hrer, in, order, to, prepare, the, political,

independently, and, on, his, own, responsibility, hitler, thus, intended, to, prevent, internal, friction, like, that, occurring, earlier, in, poland, in, 1939, when, several, german, army, generals, including, johannes, blaskowitz, had, attempted, to, bring, einsatzgruppen, leaders, to, trial, for, the, murders, they, had, committed, following, the, army, into, the, soviet, union, the, einsatzgruppen, rounded, up, and, killed, jews, and, others, deemed, undesirable, by, the, nazi, state, hitler, was, sent, frequent, reports, in, addition, 2, 8, million, soviet, prisoners, of, war, died, of, starvation, mistreatment, or, executions, in, just, eight, months, of, 1941, 42, as, many, as, 500, 000, soviet, prisoners, of, war, died, or, were, executed, in, nazi, concentration, camps, over, the, course, of, the, war, most, of, them, were, shot, or, gassed, by, early, 1941, following, himmler, s, orders, ten, concentration, camps, had, been, constructed, in, which, inmates, were, subjected, to, forced, labour, jews, from, all, over, germany, and, the, occupied, territories, were, deported, to, the, camps, or, confined, to, ghettos, as, the, germans, were, pushed, back, from, moscow, in, december, 1941, signalling, that, the, expected, quick, defeat, of, the, soviet, union, had, failed, to, materialize, hitler, and, other, nazi, officials, realised, that, mass, deportations, to, the, east, would, no, longer, be, possible, as, a, result, instead, of, deportation, many, jews, in, europe, were, destined, for, death, nazi, racial, policies, including, the,

the, german, declaration, of, war, on, the, united, states, in, december, 1941, hitler, resolved, that, the, jews, of, europe, were, to, be, exterminated, heydrich, arranged, a, meeting, held, on, 20, january, 1942, at, wannsee, a, suburb, of, berlin, attended, by, top, nazi, officials, it, was, used, to, outline, the, plans, for, the, final, solution, to, the, jewish, question, heydrich, detailed, how, those, jews, able, to, work, would, be, worked, to, death, those, unable, to, work, would, be, killed, outright, heydrich, calculated, the, number, of, jews, to, be, killed, at, 11, million, and, told, the, attendees, that, hitler, had, placed, himmler, in, charge, of, the, plan, in, june, 1942, heydrich, was, assassinated, in, prague, in, operation, anthropoid, led, by, jozef, gab, k, and, jan, kubi, members, of, czechoslovakia, s, army, in, exile, both, men, had, been, trained, by, the, british, special, operations, executive, for, the, mission, to, kill, heydrich, during, the, two, funeral, services, himmler, the, chief, mourner, took, charge, of, heydrich, s, two, young, sons, and, he, gave, the, eulogy, in, berlin, on, 9, june, after, discussions, with, himmler, and, karl, hermann, frank, hitler, ordered, brutal, reprisals, for, heydrich, s, death, over, 13, 000, people, were, arrested, and, the, village, of, lidice, was, razed, to, the, ground, its, male, inhabitants, and, all, adults, in, the, village, of, le, ky, were, murdered, at, least, 1, 300, people, were, executed, by, firing, squads, himmler, took, over, leadership, of, the, rsha, and, stepped, up, the, pace, of, the, killing, of, jews, in, aktion, reinhard, operation, reinhard, named, in, heydrich, s, honour, he, ordered, the, aktion, reinhard, camps, three, extermination, camps, to, be, constructed, at, be, ec, sobib, r, and, treblinka, initially, the, victims, were, killed, with, gas, vans, or, by, firing, squad, but, these, methods, proved, impracticable, for, an, operation, of, this, scale, in, august, 1941, himmler, attended, the, shooting, of, 100, jews, at, minsk, a, military, virgin, this, was, the, first, time, he, heard, a, shot, fired, in, anger, or, seen, dead, people, and, in, minsk, while, looking, into, the, open, grave, his, coat, and, perhaps, his, face, were, splashed, by, the, brains, of, a, victim, he, went, very, green, and, pale, and, swayed, karl, wolff, jumped, forward, held, him, steady, and, led, him, away, from, the, grave, nauseated, and, shaken, by, the, experience, he, was, concerned, about, the, impact, such, actions, would, have, on, the, mental, health, of, his, ss, men, he, decided, that, alternate, methods, of, killing, should, be, found, on, his, orders, by, early, 1942, the, camp, at, auschwitz, had, been, greatly, expanded, including, the, addition, of, gas, chambers, where, victims, were, killed, using, the, pesticide, zyklon, b, himmler, visited, the, camp, in, person, on, 17, and, 18, july, 1942, he, was, given, a, demonstration, of, a, mass, killing, using, the, gas, chamber, in, bunker, 2, and, toured, the, building, site, of, the, new, ig, farben, plant, being, constructed, at, the, nearby, town, of, monowitz, by, the, end, of, the, war, at, least, 5, 5, million, jews, had, been, killed, by, the, nazi, regime, most, estimates, range, closer, to, 6, million, himmler, visited, the, camp, at, sobib, r, in, early, 1943, by, which, time, 250, 000, people, had, been, killed, at, that, location, alone, after, witnessing, a, gassing, he, gave, 28, people, promotions, and, ordered, the, operation, of, the, camp, to, be, wound, down, in, a, prisoner, revolt, that, october, the, remaining, prisoners, killed, most, of, the, guards, and, ss, personnel, several, hundred, prisoners, escaped, about, a, hundred, were, immediately, re, captured, and, killed, some, of, the, escapees, joined, partisan, units, operating, in, the, area, the, camp, was, dismantled, by, december, 1943, the, nazis, also, targeted, romani, gypsies, as, asocial, and, criminals, by, 1935, they, were, confined, into, special, camps, away, from, ethnic, germans, in, 1938, himmler, issued, an, order, in, which, he, said, that, the, gypsy, question, would, be, determined, by, race, himmler, believed, that, the, romani, were, originally, aryan, but, had, become, a, mixed, race, only, the, racially, pure, were, to, be, allowed, to, live, in, 1939, himmler, ordered, thousands, of, gypsies, to, be, sent, to, the, dachau, concentration, camp, and, by, 1942, ordered, all, romani, sent, to, auschwitz, concentration, camp, himmler, was, one, of, the, main, architects, of, the, holocaust, using, his, deep, belief, in, the, racist, nazi, ideology, to, justify, the, murder, of, millions, of, victims, longerich, surmises, that, hitler, himmler, and, heydrich, designed, the, holocaust, during, a, period, of, intensive, meetings, and, exchanges, in, april, may, 1942, the, nazis, planned, to, kill, polish, intellectuals, and, restrict, non, germans, in, the, general, government, and, conquered, territories, to, a, fourth, grade, education, they, further, wanted, to, breed, a, master, race, of, racially, pure, nordic, aryans, in, germany, as, a, student, of, agriculture, and, a, farmer, himmler, was, acquainted, with, the, principles, of, selective, breeding, which, he, proposed, to, apply, to, humans, he, believed, that, he, could, engineer, the, german, populace, for, example, through, eugenics, to, be, nordic, in, appearance, within, several, decades, of, the, end, of, the, war, on, 4, october, 1943, during, a, secret, meeting, with, top, ss, officials, in, the, city, of, pozna, posen, and, on, 6, october, 1943, in, a, speech, to, the, party, elite, the, gauleiters, and, reichsleiters, himmler, referred, explicitly, to, the, extermination, german, ausrottung, of, the, jewish, people, a, translated, excerpt, from, the, speech, of, 4, october, reads, i, also, want, to, refer, here, very, frankly, to, a, very, difficult, matter, we, can, now, very, openly, talk, about, this, among, ourselves, and, yet, we, will, never, discuss, this, publicly, just, as, we, did, not, hesitate, on, 30, june, 1934, to, perform, our, duty, as, ordered, and, put, comrades, who, had, failed, up, against, the, wall, and, execute, them, we, also, never, spoke, about, it, nor, will, we, ever, speak, about, it, let, us, thank, god, that, we, had, within, us, enough, self, evident, fortitude, never, to, discuss, it, among, us, and, we, never, talked, about, it, every, one, of, us, was, horrified, and, yet, every, one, clearly, understood, that, we, would, do, it, next, time, when, the, order, is, given, and, when, it, becomes, necessary, i, am, talking, about, the, jewish, evacuation, the, extermination, of, the, jewish, people, it, is, one, of, those, things, that, is, easily, said, the, jewish, people, is, being, exterminated, every, party, member, will, tell, you, perfectly, clear, it, s, part, of, our, plans, we, re, eliminating, the, jews, exterminating, them, ha, a, small, matter, and, then, they, turn, up, the, upstanding, 80, million, germans, and, each, one, has, his, decent, jew, they, say, the, others, are, all, swines, but, this, particular, one, is, a, splendid, jew, but, none, has, observed, it, endured, it, most, of, you, here, know, what, it, means, when, 100, corpses, lie, next, to, each, other, when, there, are, 500, or, when, there, are, 1, 000, to, have, endured, this, and, at, the, same, time, to, have, remained, a, decent, person, with, exceptions, due, to, human, weaknesses, has, made, us, tough, and, is, a, glorious, chapter, that, has, not, and, will, not, be, spoken, of, because, we, know, how, difficult, it, would, be, for, us, if, we, still, had, jews, as, secret, saboteurs, agitators, and, rabble, rousers, in, every, city, what, with, the, bombings, with, the, burden, and, with, the, hardships, of, the, war, if, the, jews, were, still, part, of, the, german, nation, we, would, most, likely, arrive, now, at, the, state, we, were, at, in, 1916, and, 17, because, the, allies, had, indicated, that, they, were, going, to, pursue, criminal, charges, for, german, war, crimes, hitler, tried, to, gain, the, loyalty, and, silence, of, his, subordinates, by, making, them, all, parties, to, the, ongoing, genocide, hitler, therefore, authorised, himmler, s, speeches, to, ensure, that, all, party, leaders, were, complicit, in, the, crimes, and, could, not, later, deny, knowledge, of, the, killings, as, reich, commissioner, for, the, consolidation, of, german, nationhood, rkfdv, with, the, incorporated, vomi, himmler, was, deeply, involved, in, the, germanization, program, for, the, east, particularly, poland, as, laid, out, in, generalplan, ost, the, aim, was, to, enslave, expel, or, exterminate, the, native, population, and, to, make, lebensraum, living, space, for, volksdeutsche, ethnic, germans, he, continued, his, plans, to, colonise, the, east, even, when, many, germans, were, reluctant, to, relocate, there, and, despite, negative, effects, on, the, war, effort, approximately, 11, million, slavic, and, 3, 4, million, jewish, inhabitants, of, eastern, europe, were, killed, in, nazi, germany, s, extermination, campaigns, during, the, implementation, of, generalplan, ost, himmler, s, racial, groupings, began, with, the, volksliste, the, classification, of, people, deemed, of, german, blood, these, included, germans, who, had, collaborated, with, germany, before, the, war, but, also, those, who, considered, themselves, german, but, had, been, neutral, those, who, were, partially, polonized, but, germanizable, and, germans, who, were, of, polish, nationality, himmler, ordered, that, those, who, refused, to, be, classified, as, ethnic, germans, should, be, deported, to, concentration, camps, have, their, children, taken, away, or, be, assigned, to, forced, labour, himmler, s, belief, that, it, is, in, the, nature, of, german, blood, to, resist, led, to, his, conclusion, that, balts, or, slavs, who, resisted, germanization, were, racially, superior, to, more, compliant, ones, he, declared, that, no, drop, of, german, blood, would, be, lost, or, left, behind, to, mingle, with, an, alien, race, the, plan, also, included, the, kidnapping, of, eastern, european, children, by, nazi, germany, himmler, urged, obviously, in, such, a, mixture, of, peoples, there, will, always, be, some, racially, good, types, therefore, i, think, that, it, is, our, duty, to, take, their, children, with, us, to, remove, them, from, their, environment, if, necessary, by, robbing, or, stealing, them, either, we, win, over, any, good, blood, that, we, can, use, for, ourselves, and, give, it, a, place, in, our, people, or, we, destroy, that, blood, the, racially, valuable, children, were, to, be, removed, from, all, contact, with, poles, and, raised, as, germans, with, german, names, himmler, declared, we, have, faith, above, all, in, this, our, own, blood, which, has, flowed, into, a, foreign, nationality, through, the, vicissitudes, of, german, history, we, are, convinced, that, our, own, philosophy, and, ideals, will, reverberate, in, the, spirit, of, these, children, who, racially, belong, to, us, the, children, were, to, be, adopted, by, german, families, children, who, passed, muster, at, first, but, were, later, rejected, were, taken, to, kinder, kz, in, d, ghetto, where, most, of, them, eventually, died, by, january, 1943, himmler, reported, that, 629, 000, ethnic, germans, had, been, resettled, however, most, resettled, germans, did, not, live, in, the, envisioned, small, farms, but, in, temporary, camps, or, quarters, in, towns, half, a, million, residents, of, the, annexed, polish, territories, as, well, as, from, slovenia, alsace, lorraine, and, luxembourg, were, deported, to, the, general, government, or, sent, to, germany, as, slave, labour, himmler, instructed, that, the, german, nation, should, view, all, foreign, workers, brought, to, germany, as, a, danger, to, their, german, blood, in, accordance, with, german, racial, laws, sexual, relations, between, germans, and, foreigners, were, forbidden, as, rassenschande, race, defilement, on, 20, july, 1944, a, group, of, german, army, officers, led, by, claus, von, stauffenberg, and, including, some, of, the, highest, ranked, members, of, the, german, armed, forces, attempted, to, assassinate, hitler, but, failed, to, do, so, the, next, day, himmler, formed, a, special, commission, that, arrested, over, 5, 000, suspected, and, known, opponents, of, the, regime, hitler, ordered, brutal, reprisals, that, resulted, in, the, execution, of, more, than, 4, 900, people, though, himmler, was, embarrassed, by, his, failure, to, uncover, the, plot, it, led, to, an, increase, in, his, powers, and, authority, general, friedrich, fromm, commander, in, chief, of, the, replacement, army, ersatzheer, and, stauffenberg, s, immediate, superior, was, one, of, those, implicated, in, the, conspiracy, hitler, removed, fromm, from, his, post, and, named, himmler, as, his, successor, since, the, replacement, army, consisted, of, two, million, men, himmler, hoped, to, draw, on, these, reserves, to, fill, posts, within, the, waffen, ss, he, appointed, hans, j, ttner, director, of, the, ss, leadership, main, office, as, his, deputy, and, began, to, fill, top, replacement, army, posts, with, ss, men, by, november, 1944, himmler, had, merged, the, army, officer, recruitment, department, with, that, of, the, waffen, ss, and, had, successfully, lobbied, for, an, increase, in, the, quotas, for, recruits, to, the, ss, by, this, time, hitler, had, appointed, himmler, as, reichsminister, of, the, interior, succeeding, frick, and, general, plenipotentiary, for, administration, generalbevollm, chtigter, f, r, die, verwaltung, at, the, same, time,

people, s, war, against, the, invader, these, hopes, were, wildly, optimistic, in, october, 1944, children, as, young, as, fourteen, were, being, enlisted, because, of, severe, shortages, in, weapons, and, equipment, and, lack, of, training, members, of, the, volkssturm, were, poorly, prepared, for, combat, and, about, 175, 000, of, them, died, in, the, final, months, of, the, war, on, 1, january,

established, his, command, centre, at, schneidem, hl, using, his, special, train, sonderzug, steiermark, as, his, headquarters, the, train, had, only, one, telephone, line, inadequate, maps, and, no, signal, detachment, or, radios, with, which, to, establish, communication, and, relay, military, orders, himmler, seldom, left, the, train, only, worked, about, four, hours, per, day, and, insisted, on, a, daily, massage, before, commencing, work, and, a, lengthy, nap, after, lunch, general, heinz, guderian, talked, to, himmler, on, 9, february, and, demanded, that, operation, solstice, an, attack, from, pomerania, against, the, northern, flank, of, marshal, georgy, zhukov, s, 1st, belorussian, front, should, be, in, progress, by, the, 16th, himmler, argued, that, he, was, not, ready, to, commit, himself, to, a, specific, date, given, himmler, s, lack, of, qualifications, as, an, army, group, commander, guderian, convinced, himself, that, himmler, tried, to, conceal, his, incompetence, on, 13, february, guderian, met, hitler, and, demanded, that, general, walther, wenck, be, given, a, special, mandate, to, command, the, offensive, by, army, group, vistula, hitler, sent, wenck, with, a, special, mandate, but, without, specifying, wenck, s, authority, the, offensive, was, launched, on, 16, february, 1945, but, soon, stuck, in, rain, and, mud, facing, mine, fields, and, strong, antitank, defenses, that, night, wenck, was, severely, injured, in, a, car, accident, but, it, is, doubtful, that, he, could, have, salvaged, the, operation, as, guderian, later, claimed, himmler, ordered, the, offensive, to, stop, on, the, 18th, by, a, directive, for, regrouping, hitler, officially, ended, operation, solstice, on, 21, february, and, ordered, himmler, to, transfer, a, corps, headquarter, and, three, divisions, to, army, group, center, himmler, was, unable, to, devise, any, viable, plans, for, completion, of, his, military, objectives, under, pressure, from, hitler, over, the, worsening, military, situation, himmler, became, anxious, and, unable, to, give, him, coherent, reports, when, the, counter, attack, failed, to, stop, the, soviet, advance, hitler, held, himmler, personally, liable, and, accused, him, of, not, following, orders, himmler, s, military, command, ended, on, 20, march, when, hitler, replaced, him, with, general, gotthard, heinrici, as, commander, in, chief, of, army, group, vistula, by, this, time, himmler, who, had, been, under, the, care, of, his, doctor, since, 18, february, had, fled, to, the, hohenlychen, sanatorium, hitler, sent, guderian, on, a, forced, medical, leave, of, absence, and, he, reassigned, his, post, as, chief, of, staff, to, hans, krebs, on, 29, march, himmler, s, failure, and, hitler, s, response, marked, a, serious, deterioration, in, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, by, that, time, the, inner, circle, of, people, whom, hitler, trusted, was, rapidly, shrinking, in, early, 1945, the, german, war, effort, was, on, the, verge, of, collapse, and, himmler, s, relationship, with, hitler, had, deteriorated, himmler, considered, independently, negotiating, a, peace, settlement, his, masseur, felix, kersten, who, had, moved, to, sweden, acted, as, an, intermediary, in, negotiations, with, count, folke, bernadotte, head, of, the, swedish, red, cross, letters, were, exchanged, between, the, two, men, and, direct, meetings, were, arranged, by, walter, schellenberg, of, the, rsha, in, march, 1945, himmler, issued, a, directive, that, jews, were, to, be, marched, from, the, south, east, wall, s, dostwall, fortifications, construction, project, on, the, austro, hungarian, border, to, mauthausen, he, desired, hostages, for, potential, peace, negotiations, thousands, died, on, the, marches, himmler, and, hitler, met, for, the, last, time, on, 20, april, 1945, hitler, s, birthday, in, berlin, and, himmler, swore, unswerving, loyalty, to, hitler, at, a, military, briefing, on, that, day, hitler, stated, that, he, would, not, leave, berlin, in, spite, of, soviet, advances, along, with, g, ring, himmler, quickly, left, the, city, after, the, briefing, on, 21, april, himmler, met, with, norbert, masur, a, swedish, representative, of, the, world, jewish, congress, to, discuss, the, release, of, jewish, concentration, camp, inmates, as, a, result, of, these, negotiations, about, 20, 000, people, were, released, in, the, white, buses, operation, himmler, falsely, claimed, in, the, meeting, that, the, crematoria, at, camps, had, been, built, to, deal, with, the, bodies, of, prisoners, who, had, died, in, a, typhus, epidemic, he, also, claimed, very, high, survival, rates, for, the, camps, at, auschwitz, and, bergen, belsen, even, as, these, sites, were, liberated, and, it, became, obvious, that, his, figures, were, false, on, 23, april, himmler, met, directly, with, bernadotte, at, the, swedish, consulate, in, l, beck, representing, himself, as, the, provisional, leader, of, germany, he, claimed, that, hitler, would, be, dead, within, the, next, few, days, hoping, that, the, british, and, americans, would, fight, the, soviets, alongside, what, remained, of, the, wehrmacht, himmler, asked, bernadotte, to, inform, general, dwight, eisenhower, that, germany, wished, to, surrender, to, the, western, allies, and, not, to, the, soviet, union, bernadotte, asked, himmler, to, put, his, proposal, in, writing, and, himmler, obliged, meanwhile, g, ring, had, sent, a, telegram, a, few, hours, earlier, asking, hitler, for, permission, to, assume, leadership, of, the, reich, in, his, capacity, as, hitler, s, designated, deputy, an, act, that, hitler, under, the, prodding, of, martin, bormann, interpreted, as, a, demand, to, step, down, or, face, a, coup, on, 27, april, himmler, s, ss, representative, at, hitler, s, hq, in, berlin, hermann, fegelein, was, caught, in, civilian, clothes, preparing, to, desert, he, was, arrested, and, brought, back, to, the, f, hrerbunker, on, the, evening, of, 28, april, the, bbc, broadcast, a, reuters, news, report, about, himmler, s, attempted, negotiations, with, the, western, allies, hitler, had, long, considered, himmler, to, be, second, only, to, joseph, goebbels, in, loyalty, he, called, himmler, the, loyal, heinrich, german, der, treue, heinrich, hitler, flew, into, a, rage, at, this, betrayal, and, told, those, still, with, him, in, the, bunker, complex, that, himmler, s, secret, negotiations, were, the, worst, treachery, he, had, ever, known, hitler, ordered, himmler, s, arrest, and, fegelein, was, court, martialed, and, shot, by, this, time, the, soviets, had, advanced, to, the, potsdamer, platz, only, 300, m, 330, yd, from, the, reich, chancellery, and, were, preparing, to, storm, the, chancellery, this, report, combined, with, himmler, s, treachery, prompted, hitler, to, write, his, last, will, and, testament, in, the, testament, completed, on, 29, april, one, day, prior, to, his, suicide, hitler, declared, both, himmler, and, g, ring, to, be, traitors, he, stripped, himmler, of, all, of, his, party, and, state, offices, and, expelled, him, from, the, nazi, party, hitler, named, grand, admiral, karl, d, nitz, as, his, successor, himmler, met, d, nitz, in, flensburg, and, offered, himself, as, second, in, command, he, maintained, that, he, was, entitled, to, a, position, in, d, nitz, s, interim, government, as, reichsf, hrer, ss, believing, the, ss, would, be, in, a, good, position, to, restore, and, maintain, order, after, the, war, d, nitz, repeatedly, rejected, himmler, s, overtures, and, initiated, peace, negotiations, with, the, allies, he, wrote, a, letter, on, 6, may, two, days, before, the, german, instrument, of, surrender, formally, dismissing, himmler, from, all, his, posts, rejected, by, his, former, comrades, and, hunted, by, the, allies, himmler, attempted, to, go, into, hiding, he, had, not, made, extensive, preparations, for, this, but, he, carried, a, forged, paybook, under, the, name, of, sergeant, heinrich, hizinger, on, 11, may, 1945, with, a, small, band, of, companions, he, headed, south, to, friedrichskoog, without, a, final, destination, in, mind, they, continued, on, to, neuhaus, where, the, group, split, up, on, 21, may, himmler, and, two, aides, were, stopped, and, detained, at, a, checkpoint, in, bremerv, rde, set, up, by, former, soviet, pows, over, the, following, two, days, he, was, moved, around, to, several, camps, and, was, brought, to, the, british, 31st, civilian, interrogation, camp, near, l, neburg, on, 23, may, the, officials, noticed, that, himmler, s, identity, papers, bore, a, stamp, which, british, military, intelligence, had, seen, being, used, by, fleeing, members, of, the, ss, the, duty, officer, captain, thomas, selvester, began, a, routine, interrogation, himmler, admitted, who, he, was, and, selvester, had, the, prisoner, searched, himmler, was, taken, to, the, headquarters, of, the, second, british, army, in, l, neburg, where, a, doctor, conducted, a, medical, exam, on, him, the, doctor, attempted, to, examine, the, inside, of, himmler, s, mouth, but, the, prisoner, was, reluctant, to, open, it, and, jerked, his, head, away, himmler, then, bit, into, a, hidden, potassium, cyanide, pill, and, collapsed, onto, the, floor, he, was, dead, within, 15, minutes, despite, efforts, to, expel, the, poison, from, his, system, shortly, afterward, himmler, s, body, was, buried, in, an, unmarked, grave, near, l, neburg, the, grave, s, location, remains, unknown, himmler, was, interested, in, mysticism, and, the, occult, from, an, early, age, he, tied, this, interest, into, his, racist, philosophy, looking, for, proof, of, aryan, and, nordic, racial, superiority, from, ancient, times, he, promoted, a, cult, of, ancestor, worship, particularly, among, members, of, the, ss, as, a, way, to, keep, the, race, pure, and, provide, immortality, to, the, nation, viewing, the, ss, as, an, order, along, the, lines, of, the, teutonic, knights, he, had, them, take, over, the, church, of, the, teutonic, order, in, vienna, in, 1939, he, began, the, process, of, replacing, christianity, with, a, new, moral, code, that, rejected, humanitarianism, and, challenged, the, christian, concept, of, marriage, the, ahnenerbe, a, research, society, founded, by, himmler, in, 1935, searched, the, globe, for, proof, of, the, superiority, and, ancient, origins, of, the, germanic, race, all, regalia, and, uniforms, of, nazi, germany, particularly, those, of, the, ss, used, symbolism, in, their, designs, the, stylised, lightning, bolt, logo, of, the, ss, was, chosen, in, 1932, the, logo, is, a, pair, of, runes, from, a, set, of, 18, armanen, runes, created, by, guido, von, list, in, 1906, the, ancient, sowil, rune, originally, symbolised, the, sun, but, was, renamed, sieg, victory, in, list, s, iconography, himmler, modified, a, variety, of, existing, customs, to, emphasise, the, elitism, and, central, role, of, the, ss, an, ss, naming, ceremony, was, to, replace, baptism, marriage, ceremonies, were, to, be, altered, a, separate, ss, funeral, ceremony, was, to, be, held, in, addition, to, christian, ceremonies, and, ss, centric, celebrations, of, the, summer, and, winter, solstices, were, instituted, the, totenkopf, death, s, head, symbol, used, by, german, military, units, for, hundreds, of, years, had, been, chosen, for, the, ss, by, julius, schreck, himmler, placed, particular, importance, on, the, death, s, head, rings, they, were, never, to, be, sold, and, were, to, be, returned, to, him, upon, the, death, of, the, owner, he, interpreted, the, death, s, head, symbol, to, mean, solidarity, to, the, cause, and, a, commitment, unto, death, as, second, in, command, of, the, ss, and, then, reichsf, hrer, ss, himmler, was, in, regular, contact, with, hitler, to, arrange, for, ss, men, as, bodyguards, himmler, was, not, involved, with, nazi, party, policy, making, decisions, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, seizure, of, power, from, the, late, 1930s, the, ss, was, independent, of, the, control, of, other, state, agencies, or, government, departments, and, he, reported, only, to, hitler, hitler, promoted, and, practised, the, f, hrerprinzip, the, principle, required, absolute, obedience, of, all, subordinates, to, their, superiors, thus, hitler, viewed, the, government, structure, as, a, pyramid, with, himself, the, infallible, leader, at, the, apex, accordingly, himmler, placed, himself, in, a, position, of, subservience, to, hitler, and, was, unconditionally, obedient, to, him, however, he, like, other, top, nazi, officials, had, aspirations, to, one, day, succeed, hitler, as, leader, of, the, reich, himmler, considered, speer, to, be, an, especially, dangerous, rival, both, in, the, reich, administration, and, as, a, potential, successor, to, hitler, hitler, called, himmler, s, mystical, and, pseudoreligious, interests, nonsense, himmler, was, not, a, member, of, hitler, s, inner, circle, the, two, men, were, not, very, close, and, rarely, saw, each, other, socially, himmler, socialised, almost, exclusively, with, other, members, of, the, ss, his, unconditional, loyalty, and, efforts, to, please, hitler, earned, him, the, nickname, of, der, treue, heinrich, the, faithful, heinrich, however, in, the, last, days, of, the, war, when, it, became, clear, that, hitler, planned, to, die, in, berlin, himmler, left, his, long, time, superior, to, try, to, save, himself, himmler, met, his, future, wife, margarete, boden, in, 1927, seven, years, his, senior, she, was, a, nurse, who, shared, his, interest, in, herbal, medicine, and, homoeopathy, and, was, part, owner, of, a, small, private, clinic, they, were, married, in, july, 1928, and, their, only, child, gudrun, was, born, on, 8, august, 1929, the, couple, were, also, foster, parents, to, a, boy, named, gerhard, von, ahe, son, of, an, ss, officer, who, had, died, before, the, war, margarete, sold, her, share, of, the, clinic, and, used, the, proceeds, to, buy, a, plot, of, land, in, waldtrudering, near, munich, where, they, erected, a, prefabricated, house, himmler, was, constantly, away, on, party, business, so, his, wife, took, charge, of, their, efforts, mostly, unsuccessful, to, raise, livestock, for, sale, they, had, a, dog, t, hle, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, the, family, moved, first, to, m, hlstrasse, in, munich, and, in, 1934, to, tegernsee, where, they, bought, a, house, himmler, also, later, obtained, a, large, house, in, the, berlin, suburb, of, dahlem, free, of, charge, as, an, official, residence, the, couple, saw, little, of, each, other, as, himmler, became, totally, absorbed, by, work, the, relationship, was, strained, the, couple, did, unite, for, social, functions, they, were, frequent, guests, at, the, heydrich, home, margarete, saw, it, as, her, duty, to, invite, the, wives, of, the, senior, ss, leaders, over, for, afternoon, coffee, and, tea, on, wednesday, afternoons, hedwig, potthast, himmler, s, young, secretary, starting, in, 1936, became, his, mistress, by, 1939, she, left, her, job, in, 1941, he, arranged, accommodation, for, her, first, in, mecklenburg, and, later, at, berchtesgaden, he, fathered, two, children, with, her, a, son, helge, born, 15, february, 1942, mecklenburg, and, a, daughter, nanette, dorothea, born, 20, july, 1944, berchtesgaden, margarete, by, then, living, in, gmund, with, her, daughter, learned, of, the, relationship, sometime, in, 1941, she, and, himmler, were, already, separated, and, she, decided, to, tolerate, the, relationship, for, the, sake, of, her, daughter, working, as, a, nurse, for, the, german, red, cross, during, the, war, margarete, was, appointed, supervisor, in, one, of, germany, s, military, districts, wehrkreis, iii, berlin, brandenburg, himmler, was, close, to, his, first, daughter, gudrun, whom, he, nicknamed, p, ppi, dolly, he, phoned, her, every, few, days, and, visited, as, often, as, he, could, margarete, s, diaries, record, that, gerhard, left, the, national, political, educational, institute, in, berlin, due, to, poor, examination, results, at, 16, he, joined, the, ss, in, brno, and, fought, on, the, eastern, front, he, was, captured, by, the, russians, but, was, later, returned, to, germany, hedwig, and, margarete, both, remained, loyal, to, himmler, writing, to, gebhard, in, february, 1945, margarete, said, how, wonderful, that, he, has, been, called, to, great, tasks, and, is, equal, to, them, the, whole, of, germany, is, looking, to, him, hedwig, expressed, similar, sentiments, in, a, letter, to, himmler, in, january, margarete, and, gudrun, left, gmund, as, allied, troops, advanced, into, the, area, they, were, arrested, by, american, troops, in, bolzano, italy, and, held, in, various, internment, camps, in, italy, france, and, germany, they, were, brought, to, nuremberg, to, testify, at, the, trials, and, were, released, in, november, 1946, gudrun, emerged, from, the, experience, embittered, by, her, alleged, mistreatment, and, remained, devoted, to, her, father, s, memory, she, later, worked, for, the, west, german, spy, agency, bundesnachrichtendienst, bnd, from, 1961, to, 1963, peter, longerich, observes, that, himmler, s, ability, to, consolidate, his, ever, increasing, powers, and, responsibilities, into, a, coherent, system, under, the, auspices, of, the, ss, led, him, to, become, one, of, the, most, powerful, men, in, the, third, reich, historian, wolfgang, sauer, says, that, although, he, was, pedantic, dogmatic, and, dull, himmler, emerged, under, hitler, as, second, in, actual, power, his, strength, lay, in, a, combination, of, unusual, shrewdness, burning, ambition, and, servile, loyalty, to, hitler, in, 2008, the, german, news, magazine, der, spiegel, described, himmler, as, one, of, the, most, brutal, mass, murderers, in, history, and, the, architect, of, the, holocaust, historian, john, toland, relates, a, story, by, g, nter, syrup, a, subordinate, of, heydrich, heydrich, showed, him, a, picture, of, himmler, and, said, the, top, half, is, the, teacher, but, the, lower, half, is, the, sadist, historian, adrian, weale, comments, that, himmler, and, the, ss, followed, hitler, s, policies, without, question, or, ethical, considerations, himmler, accepted, hitler, and, nazi, ideology, and, saw, the, ss, as, a, chivalric, teutonic, order, of, new, germans, himmler, adopted, the, doctrine, of, auftragstaktik, mission, command, whereby, orders, were, given, as, broad, directives, with, authority, delegated, downward, to, the, appropriate, level, to, carry, them, out, in, a, timely, and, efficient, manner, weale, states, that, the, ss, ideology, gave, the, men, a, doctrinal, framework, and, the, mission, command,
