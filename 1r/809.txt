the, greatest, linguist, of, antiquity, p, ini, was, the, greatest, linguist, of, antiquity, and, deserves, to, be, treated, as, such, jf, staal, a, reader, on, the, sanskrit, grammarians, p, ini, sanskrit, pronounced, was, a, logician, sanskrit, philologist, grammarian, and, revered, scholar, in, ancient, india, variously, dated, between, the, 7th, and, 4th, century, bce, since, the, discovery, and, publication, of, his, work, a, dhy, y, by, european, scholars, in, the, nineteenth, century, p, ini, has, been, considered, the, first, descriptive, linguist, and, even, labelled, as, the, father, of, linguistics, his, approach, to, grammar, influenced, such, foundational, linguists, as, ferdinand, de, saussure, and, leonard, bloomfield, father, of, linguistics, the, history, of, linguistics, begins, not, with, plato, or, aristotle, but, with, the, indian, grammarian, panini, rens, bod, university, of, amsterdam, p, ini, likely, lived, in, alatura, in, ancient, gandh, ra, in, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, during, the, mah, janapada, era, the, name, p, ini, is, a, patronymic, meaning, descendant, of, pa, ina, his, full, name, was, dak, iputra, p, ini, according, to, verses, 1, 75, 13, and, 3, 251, 12, of, patanjali, s, mah, bh, ya, with, the, first, part, suggesting, his, mother, s, name, was, dak, i, nothing, definite, is, known, about, when, p, ini, lived, not, even, in, which, century, he, lived, p, ini, has, been, dated, between, the, seventh, and, fourth, century, bce, george, cardona, 1997, in, his, authoritative, survey, and, review, of, p, ini, related, studies, states, that, the, available, evidence, strongly, supports, a, dating, not, before, 400, bce, while, earlier, dating, depends, on, interpretations, and, is, not, probative, based, on, numismatic, findings, von, hin, ber, 1989, and, falk, 1993, place, p, ini, in, the, mid, 4th, century, bce, p, ini, s, rupya, a, 5, 2, 119, a, 5, 2, 120, a, 5, 4, 43, a, 4, 3, 153, mentions, a, specific, gold, coin, the, ni, ka, in, several, sutras, which, was, introduced, in, india, in, the, 4th, century, bce, according, to, houben, the, date, of, c, 350, bce, for, p, ini, is, thus, based, on, concrete, evidence, which, till, now, has, not, been, refuted, according, to, bronkhorst, there, is, no, reason, to, doubt, the, validity, of, von, hin, ber, s, and, falk, s, argument, setting, the, terminus, post, quem, for, the, date, of, p, ini, at, 350, bce, or, the, decades, thereafter, according, to, bronkhorst, thanks, to, the, work, carried, out, by, hin, ber, 1990, 34, 35, and, falk, 1993, 303, 304, we, now, know, that, p, ini, lived, in, all, probability, far, closer, in, time, to, the, period, of, a, oka, than, had, hitherto, been, thought, according, to, falk, s, reasoning, panini, must, have, lived, during, the, decade, following, 350, bce, that, is, just, before, or, contemporaneously, with, the, invasion, by, alexander, of, macedonia, it, is, not, certain, whether, p, ini, used, writing, for, the, composition, of, his, work, though, it, is, generally, agreed, that, he, knew, of, a, form, of, writing, based, on, references, to, words, such, as, lipi, script, and, lipikara, scribe, in, section, 3, 2, of, the, a, dhy, y, the, dating, of, the, introduction, of, writing, to, present, day, north, west, pakistan, may, therefore, give, further, information, on, the, historical, dating, of, p, ini, p, ini, cites, at, least, ten, grammarians, and, linguists, before, him, pi, ali, k, yapa, g, rgya, g, lava, c, kravarma, a, bh, radv, ja, ka,

sanskrit, epic, brihatkatha, and, the, buddhist, scripture, ma, ju, r, m, la, kalpa, both, mention, p, ini, to, have, been, a, contemporary, with, the, king, dhana, nanda, reigned, 329, 321, bce, the, last, monarch, of, the, nanda, empire, before, chandragupta, maurya, came, to, power, cardona, offers, an, earlier, date, for, p, ini, by, arguing, the, compound, word, yavan, n, discussed, in, sutra, 4, 1, 49, instead, of, referring, to, a, writing, lipi, c, q, cuneiform, of, the, achaemenid, empire, or, the, greek, of, alexander, the, great, refers, to, greek, women, and, that, indus, valley, residents, possibly, had, contacts, with, greek, women, before, darius, s, 535, bce, or, alexander, s, 326, bce, conquests, k, b, pathak, 1930, argues, that, the, kum, ra, rama, a, of, sutra, 2, 1, 70, derived, from, rama, a, which, refers, to, female, renunciates, c, q, buddhist, nuns, could, also, refer, to, jain, aryika, of, unknown, origin, possibly, permitting, p, ini, to, be, placed, before, the, 5th, century, bce, gautama, buddha, others, based, on, panini, s, linguistic, style, date, his, works, to, the, sixth, or, fifth, century, bce, as, nothing, certain, is, known, about, p, ini, s, personal, life, in, an, inscription, of, siladitya, vii, of, valabhi, he, is, called, al, turiya, which, means, a, man, from, salatura, this, means, panini, lived, in, salatura, in, ancient, gandhara, present, day, north, west, pakistan, which, likely, was, near, lahor, a, town, at, the, junction, of, the, indus, and, kabul, rivers, according, to, the, memoirs, of, the, 7th, century, chinese, scholar, xuanzang, there, was, a, town, called, suoluoduluo, on, the, indus, where, p, ini, was, born, and, where, he, composed, the, qingming, lun, sanskrit, vy, kara, a, according, to, hartmut, scharfe, p, ini, lived, in, gandhara, close, to, the, borders, of, the, achaemenid, empire, and, gand, ra, was, then, an, achaemenian, satrapy, following, the, achaemenid, conquest, of, the, indus, valley, he, must, therefore, have, been, technically, a, persian, subject, but, his, work, shows, no, awareness, of, the, persian, language, according, to, patrick, olivelle, p, ini, s, text, and, references, to, him, elsewhere, suggest, that, he, was, clearly, a, northerner, probably, from, the, northwestern, region, according, to, kath, sarits, gara, legends, p, ini, studied, under, his, guru, varsha, in, pataliputra, not, the, brightest, of, his, disciples, on, the, advice, of, varsha, s, wife, p, ini, went, to, the, himalayas, to, do, penance, and, gain, knowledge, from, shiva, sutras, were, granted, by, shiva, who, danced, and, played, his, damaru, before, p, ini, and, produced, the, basic, sounds, of, these, sutras, panini, accepted, them, and, they, are, now, known, as, the, shiva, sutras, armed, with, this, new, grammar, p, ini, came, back, from, the, himalayas, to, pataliputra, but, at, the, same, time, vararuchi, another, disciple, of, varsha, had, learned, of, a, grammar, from, indra, they, engaged, in, a, debate, which, lasted, eight, days, and, on, the, last, day, with, vararuchi, emerging, dominant, p, ini, was, able, to, defeat, him, with, the, help, of, shiva, who, destroyed, vararuchi, s, grammar, book, p, ini, then, defeated, the, rest, of, varsha, s, disciples, and, emerged, as, the, greatest, grammarian, p, ini, is, believed, to, have, spent, the, major, portion, of, his, life, in, pataliputra, and, according, to, some, pandits, he, was, born, and, brought, up, there, the, ancestors, of, p, ini, having, already, moved, there, from, salatura, p, ini, has, also, been, associated, with, the, university, of, taxila, p, ini, is, also, mentioned, in, indian, fables, and, other, ancient, texts, the, panchatantra, for, example, mentions, that, p, ini, was, killed, by, a, lion, according, to, some, historians, pingala, was, the, brother, of, p, ini, p, ini, was, depicted, on, a, five, rupee, indian, postage, stamp, in, august, 2004, the, most, important, of, p, ini, s, works, the, a, dhy, y, is, a, grammar, that, essentially, defines, the, sanskrit, language, modeled, on, the, dialect, and, register, of, elite, speakers, in, his, time, the, text, also, accounts, for, some, features, of, the, older, vedic, language, the, a, t, dhy, y, is, a, descriptive, and, generative, grammar, with, algebraic, rules, governing, every, aspect, of, the, language, it, is, supplemented, by, three, ancillary, texts, the, ak, arasam, mn, ya, dh, tup, ha, and, ga, ap, ha, growing, out, of, a, centuries, long, effort, to, preserve, the, language, of, the, vedic, hymns, from, corruption, the, a, t, dhy, y, is, the, high, point, of, a, vigorous, sophisticated, grammatical, tradition, devised, to, arrest, language, change, the, a, t, dhy, y, s, preeminence, is, underlined, by, the, fact, that, it, eclipsed, all, similar, works, that, came, before, while, not, the, first, it, is, the, oldest, such, text, surviving, in, its, entirety, the, a, dhy, y, consists, of, 3, 959, s, tras, in, eight, chapters, which, are, each, subdivided, into, four, sections, or, p, das, the, text, takes, material, from, lexical, lists, dh, tup, ha, ga, ap, tha, as, input, and, describes, the, algorithms, to, be, applied, to, them, for, the, generation, of, well, formed, words, such, is, its, intricacy, that, the, correct, application, of, its, rules, and, metarules, is, still, being, worked, out, centuries, later, the, a, dhy, y, composed, in, an, era, when, oral, composition, and, transmission, was, the, norm, is, staunchly, embedded, in, that, oral, tradition, in, order, to, ensure, wide, dissemination, p, ini, is, said, to, have, preferred, brevity, over, clarity, it, can, be, recited, end, to, end, in, two, hours, this, has, led, to, the, emergence, of, a, great, number, of, commentaries, of, his, work, over, the, centuries, which, for, the, most, part, adhere, to, the, foundations, laid, by, p, ini, s, work, indian, curriculums, in, the, late, classical, era, had, at, their, core, a, system, of, grammatical, study, and, linguistic, analysis, the, core, text, for, this, study, was, the, a, dhy, y, of, p, ini, the, sine, qua, non, of, learning, this, grammar, of, p, ini, had, been, the, object, of, intense, study, for, the, ten, centuries, prior, to, the, composition, of, the, bha, ik, vya, it, was, bha, i, s, purpose, to, provide, a, study, aid, to, p, ini, s, text, by, using, the, examples, already, provided, in, the, existing, grammatical, commentaries, in, the, context, of, the, r, m, ya, a, the, intention, of, the, author, was, to, teach, this, advanced, science, through, a, relatively, easy, and, pleasant, medium, in, his, own, words, this, composition, is, like, a, lamp, to, those, who, perceive, the, meaning, of, words, and, like, a, hand, mirror, for, a, blind, man, to, those, without, grammar, this, poem, which, is, to, be, understood, by, means, of, a, commentary, is, a, joy, to, those, sufficiently, learned, through, my, fondness, for, the, scholar, i, have, here, slighted, the, dullard, bha, ik, vya, 22, 33, 34, p, ini, is, known, for, his, text, a, dhy, y, a, sutra, style, treatise, on, sanskrit, grammar, which, consists, of, 3, 996, verses, or, rules, on, linguistics, syntax, and, semantics, in, eight, chapters, which, is, the, foundational, text, of, the, vy, kara, a, branch, of, the, vedanga, the, auxiliary, scholarly, disciplines, of, the, vedic, period, his, aphoristic, text, attracted, numerous, bhashya, commentaries, of, which, the, mah, bh, ya, by, patanjali, is, the, most, famous, his, ideas, influenced, and, attracted, commentaries, from, scholars, of, other, indian, religions, such, as, buddhism, p, ini, s, analysis, of, noun, compounds, still, forms, the, basis, of, modern, linguistic, theories, of, compounding, in, indian, languages, p, ini, s, comprehensive, and, scientific, theory, of, grammar, is, conventionally, taken, to, mark, the, start, of, classical, sanskrit, his, systematic, treatise, inspired, and, made, sanskrit, the, preeminent, indian, language, of, learning, and, literature, for, two, millennia, p, ini, s, theory, of, morphological, analysis, was, more, advanced, than, any, equivalent, western, theory, before, the, 20th, century, his, treatise, is, generative, and, descriptive, uses, metalanguage, and, meta, rules, and, has, been, compared, to, the, turing, machine, wherein, the, logical, structure, of, any, computing, device, has, been, reduced, to, its, essentials, using, an, idealized, mathematical, model, traditional, p, ini, s, work, became, known, in, 19th, century, europe, where, it, influenced, modern, linguistics, initially, through, franz, bopp, who, mainly, looked, at, p, ini, subsequently, a, wider, body, of, work, influenced, sanskrit, scholars, such, as, ferdinand, de, saussure, leonard, bloomfield, and, roman, jakobson, frits, staal, 1930, 2012, discussed, the, impact, of, indian, ideas, on, language, in, europe, after, outlining, the, various, aspects, of, the, contact, staal, notes, that, the, idea, of, formal, rules, in, language, proposed, by, ferdinand, de, saussure, in, 1894, and, developed, by, noam, chomsky, in, 1957, has, origins, in, the, european, exposure, to, the, formal, rules, of, p, inian, grammar, in, particular, de, saussure, who, lectured, on, sanskrit, for, three, decades, may, have, been, influenced, by, p, ini, and, bhartrihari, his, idea, of, the, unity, of, the, signifier, signified, in, the, sign, somewhat, resembles, the, notion, of, spho, a, more, importantly, the, very, idea, that, formal, rules, can, be, applied, to, areas, outside, of, logic, or, mathematics, may, itself, have, been, catalysed, by, europe, s, contact, with, the, work, of, sanskrit, grammarians, p, ini, and, the, later, indian, linguist, bhartrihari, had, a, significant, influence, on, many, of, the, foundational, ideas, proposed, by, ferdinand, de, saussure, professor, of, sanskrit, who, is, widely, considered, the, father, of, modern, structural, linguistics, and, with, charles, s, peirce, on, the, other, side, to, semiotics, although, the, concept, saussure, used, was, semiology, saussure, himself, cited, indian, grammar, as, an, influence, on, some, of, his, ideas, in, his, m, moire, sur, le, syst, me, primitif, des, voyelles, dans, les, langues, indo, europ, ennes, memoir, on, the, original, system, of, vowels, in, the, indo, european, languages, published, in, 1879, he, mentions, indian, grammar, as, an, influence, on, his, idea, that, reduplicated, aorists, represent, imperfects, of, a, verbal, class, in, his, de, l, emploi, du, g, nitif, absolu, en, sanscrit, on, the, use, of, the, genitive, absolute, in, sanskrit, published, in, 1881, he, specifically, mentions, p, ini, as, an, influence, on, the, work, prem, singh, in, his, foreword, to, the, reprint, edition, of, the, german, translation, of, p, ini, s, grammar, in, 1998, concluded, that, the, effect, panini, s, work, had, on, indo, european, linguistics, shows, itself, in, various, studies, and, that, a, number, of, seminal, works, come, to, mind, including, saussure, s, works, and, the, analysis, that, gave, rise, to, the, laryngeal, theory, further, stating, this, type, of, structural, analysis, suggests, influence, from, panini, s, analytical, teaching, george, cardona, however, warns, against, overestimating, the, influence, of, p, ini, on, modern, linguistics, although, saussure, also, refers, to, predecessors, who, had, taken, this, paninian, rule, into, account, it, is, reasonable, to, conclude, that, he, had, a, direct, acquaintance, with, panini, s, work, as, far, as, i, am, able, to, discern, upon, rereading, saussure, s, m, moire, however, it, shows, no, direct, influence, of, paninian, grammar, indeed, on, occasion, saussure, follows, a, path, that, is, contrary, to, paninian, procedure, the, founding, father, of, american, structuralism, leonard, bloomfield, wrote, a, 1927, paper, titled, on, some, rules, of, p, ini, rishi, rajpopat, elaborated, in, 2021, in, his, phd, thesis, a, deeper, understanding, of, panini, s, language, machine, by, designing, a, simple, system, of, resolving, rule, conflicts, his, thesis, has, been, critiqued, as, being, built, upon, flawed, premises, and, understanding, of, rules, by, prominent, indian, sanskrit, scholars, p, ini, s, grammar, is, the, world, s, first, formal, system, developed, well, before, the, 19th, century, innovations, of, gottlob, frege, and, the, subsequent, development, of, mathematical, logic, in, designing, his, grammar, p, ini, used, the, method, of, auxiliary, symbols, in, which, new, affixes, are, designated, to, mark, syntactic, categories, and, the, control, of, grammatical, derivations, this, technique, rediscovered, by, the, logician, emil, post, became, a, standard, method, in, the, design, of, computer, programming, languages, sanskritists, now, accept, that, p, ini, s, linguistic, apparatus, is, well, described, as, an, applied, post, system, considerable, evidence, shows, ancient, mastery, of, context, sensitive, grammars, and, a, general, ability, to, solve, many, complex, problems, frits, staal, has, written, that, panini, is, the, indian, euclid, two, literary, works, are, attributed, to, p, ini, though, they, are, now, lost, there, are, many, proto, mathematical, concepts, found, in, p, ini, s, works, p, ini, came, up, with, a, plethora, of, ideas, to, organize, the, known, grammatical, forms, of, his, day, in, a, systematic, way, like, any, mathematician, who, models, a, known, phenomenon, in, mathematical, language, p, ini, created, a, metalanguage, which, is, very, close, to, the, modern, day, ideas, of, algebra
