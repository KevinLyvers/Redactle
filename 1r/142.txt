seascape, emerged, from, the, greenland, photographs, in, 1982, and, 1983, richter, made, a, series, of, paintings, of, candles, and, skulls, that, relate, to, a, longstanding, tradition, of, still, life, memento, mori, painting, each, composition, is, most, commonly, based, on, a, photograph, taken, by, richter, in, his, own, studio, influenced, by, old, master, vanitas, painters, such, as, georges, de, la, tour, and, francisco, de, zurbar, n, the, artist, began, to, experiment, with, arrangements, of, candles, and, skulls, placed, in, varying, degrees, of, natural, light, sitting, atop, otherwise, barren, tables, the, candle, paintings, coincided, with, his, first, large, scale, abstract, paintings, and, represent, the, complete, antithesis, to, those, vast, colorful, and, playfully, meaningless, works, richter, has, made, only, 27, of, these, still, lifes, in, 1995, the, artist, marked, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, allied, bombings, of, his, hometown, dresden, during, the, second, world, war, his, solitary, candle, was, reproduced, on, a, monumental, scale, and, placed, overlooking, the, river, elbe, as, a, symbol, of, rejuvenation, richter, has, said, that, while, painting, this, series, i, did, experience, feelings, to, do, with, contemplation, remembering, silence, and, death, in, a, 1988, series, of, 15, ambiguous, photo, paintings, entitled, 18, october, 1977, he, depicted, four, members, of, the, red, army, faction, raf, a, german, left, wing, militant, organization, these, paintings, were, created, from, black, and, white, newspaper, and, police, photos, three, raf, members, were, found, dead, in, their, prison, cells, on, 18, october, 1977, and, the, cause, of, their, deaths, was, the, focus, of, widespread, controversy, in, the, late, 1980s, richter, had, begun, to, collect, images, of, the, group, which, he, used, as, the, basis, for, the, 15, paintings, exhibited, for, the, first, time, in, krefeld, in, 1989, the, paintings, were, based, on, an, official, portrait, of, ulrike, meinhof, during, her, years, as, a, radical, journalist, on, photographs, of, the, arrest, of, holger, meins, on, police, shots, of, gudrun, ensslin, in, prison, on, andreas, baader, s, bookshelves, and, the, record, player, to, conceal, his, gun, on, the, dead, figures, of, meinhof, ensslin, and, baader, and, on, the, funeral, of, ensslin, baader, and, jan, carl, raspe, since, 1989, richter, has, worked, on, creating, new, images, by, dragging, wet, paint, over, photographs, the, photographs, not, all, taken, by, richter, himself, are, mostly, snapshots, of, daily, life, family, vacations, pictures, of, friends, mountains, buildings, and, streetscapes, richter, was, flying, to, new, york, on, 11, september, 2001, but, due, to, the, 9, 11, attacks, including, on, the, world, trade, center, his, plane, was, diverted, to, halifax, nova, scotia, a, few, years, later, he, made, one, small, painting, specifically, about, the, planes, crashing, into, the, world, trade, center, in, september, a, history, painting, by, gerhard, richter, robert, storr, situates, richter, s, 2005, painting, september, within, a, brand, of, anti, ideological, thought, that, he, finds, throughout, richter, s, work, he, considers, how, the, ubiquitous, photographic, documentation, of, 11, september, attacks, affects, the, uniqueness, of, one, s, distinct, remembrance, of, the, events, and, he, offers, a, valuable, comparison, to, richter, s, 18, october, 1977, cycle, in, the, 2000s, richter, made, a, number, of, works, that, dealt, with, scientific, phenomena, in, 2003, he, produced, several, paintings, with, the, same, title, silicate, large, oil, on, canvas, pieces, these, show, latticed, rows, of, light, and, dark, grey, blobs, whose, shapes, quasi, repeat, as, they, race, across, the, frame, their, angle, modulating, from, painting, to, painting, they, depict, a, photo, published, in, the, frankfurter, allgemeine, zeitung, of, a, computer, generated, simulacrum, of, reflections, from, the, silicon, dioxide, found, in, insects, shells, in, 2014, richter, created, a, cycle, of, four, paintings, using, the, sonderkommando, photographs, which, were, taken, in, the, auschwitz, birkenau, concentration, camp, during, the, holocaust, titled, birkenau, richter, s, early, work, table, 1962, consisted, of, a, painting, of, a, table, taken, from, a, photograph, in, a, magazine, with, tachiste, gestural, marks, overlapping, those, marks, can, be, read, as, cancelling, the, photorealist, representation, using, haptic, swirls, of, grey, paint, as, well, as, a, form, of, generativity, in, 1969, richter, produced, the, first, of, a, group, of, grey, monochromes, that, consist, exclusively, of, the, textures, resulting, from, different, methods, of, paint, application, in, 1976, richter, first, gave, the, title, abstract, painting, to, one, of, his, works, by, presenting, a, painting, without, even, a, few, words, to, name, and, explain, it, he, felt, he, was, letting, a, thing, come, rather, than, creating, it, in, his, abstract, pictures, richter, builds, up, cumulative, layers, of, non, representational, painting, beginning, with, brushing, big, swaths, of, primary, color, onto, canvas, the, paintings, evolve, in, stages, based, on, his, responses, to, the, picture, s, progress, the, incidental, details, and, patterns, that, emerge, throughout, his, process, richter, uses, the, same, techniques, he, uses, in, his, representational, paintings, blurring, and, scraping, to, veil, and, expose, prior, layers, from, the, mid, 1980s, richter, began, to, use, a, homemade, squeegee, to, rub, and, scrape, the, paint, that, he, had, applied, in, large, bands, across, his, canvases, in, an, interview, with, benjamin, h, d, buchloch, in, 1986, richter, was, asked, about, his, monochrome, grey, pictures, and, abstract, pictures, and, their, connection, with, the, artists, yves, klein, and, ellsworth, kelly, the, following, are, richter, s, answers, the, grey, pictures, were, done, at, a, time, when, there, were, monochrome, paintings, everywhere, i, painted, them, nonetheless, not, kelly, but, bob, ryman, brice, marden, alan, charlton, yves, klein, and, many, others, in, the, 1990s, the, artist, began, to, run, his, squeegee, up, and, down, the, canvas, in, an, ordered, fashion, to, produce, vertical, columns, that, take, on, the, look, of, a, wall, of, planks, richter, s, abstract, work, and, its, illusion, of, space, developed, out, of, his, incidental, process, an, accumulation, of, spontaneous, reactive, gestures, of, adding, moving, and, subtracting, paint, despite, unnatural, palettes, spaceless, sheets, of, color, and, obvious, trails, of, the, artist, s, tools, the, abstract, pictures, often, act, like, windows, through, which, we, see, the, landscape, outside, as, in, his, representational, paintings, there, is, an, equalization, of, illusion, and, paint, in, those, paintings, he, reduces, worldly, images, to, mere, incidents, of, art, similarly, in, his, abstract, pictures, richter, exalts, spontaneous, intuitive, mark, making, to, a, level, of, spatial, logic, and, believability, firenze, continues, a, cycle, of, 99, works, conceived, in, the, autumn, of, 1999, and, executed, in, the, same, year, and, thereafter, the, series, of, overpainted, photographs, or, bermalte, fotographien, consists, of, small, paintings, bearing, images, of, the, city, of, florence, created, by, the, artist, as, a, tribute, to, the, music, of, steve, reich, and, the, work, of, contempoartensemble, a, florence, based, group, of, musicians, after, 2000, richter, made, a, number, of, works, that, dealt, with, scientific, phenomena, in, particular, with, aspects, of, reality, that, cannot, be, seen, by, the, naked, eye, in, 2006, richter, conceived, six, paintings, as, a, coherent, group, under, the, title, cage, named, after, the, american, avant, garde, composer, john, cage, the, cage, paintings, are, large, works, constructed, from, intersecting, fields, lines, and, swaths, of, uneven, smears, that, reflect, the, broad, squeegee, tool, which, richter, drags, across, the, canvases, before, removing, areas, of, paint, to, generate, a, subtractive, method, of, concealing, and, revealing, variegated, layers, and, patches, in, may, 2002, richter, photographed, 216, details, of, his, abstract, painting, no, 648, 2, from, 1987, working, on, a, long, table, over, a, period, of, several, weeks, richter, combined, these, 10, x, 15, cm, details, with, 165, texts, on, the, iraq, war, published, in, the, german, frankfurter, allgemeine, zeitung, newspaper, on, 20, and, 21, march, this, work, was, published, in, 2004, as, a, book, entitled, war, cut, in, november, 2008, richter, began, a, series, in, which, he, applied, ink, droplets, to, wet, paper, using, alcohol, and, lacquer, to, extend, and, retard, the, ink, s, natural, tendency, to, bloom, and, creep, the, resulting, november, sheets, are, regarded, as, a, significant, departure, from, his, previous, watercolours, in, that, the, pervasive, soaking, of, ink, into, wet, paper, produced, double, sided, works, sometimes, the, uppermost, sheets, bled, into, others, generating, a, sequentially, developing, series, of, images, in, a, few, cases, richter, applied, lacquer, to, one, side, of, the, sheet, or, drew, pencil, lines, across, the, patches, of, colour, as, early, as, 1966, richter, had, made, paintings, based, on, colour, charts, using, the, rectangles, of, colour, as, found, objects, in, an, apparently, limitless, variety, of, hue, these, culminated, in, 1973, 4, in, a, series, of, large, format, pictures, such, as, 256, colours, richter, painted, three, series, of, color, chart, paintings, between, 1966, and, 1974, each, series, growing, more, ambitious, in, their, attempt, to, create, through, their, purely, arbitrary, arrangement, of, colors, the, artist, began, his, investigations, into, the, complex, permutations, of, color, charts, in, 1966, with, a, small, painting, entitled, 10, colors, the, charts, provided, anonymous, and, impersonal, source, material, a, way, for, richter, to, disassociate, color, from, any, traditional, descriptive, symbolic, or, expressive, end, when, he, began, to, make, these, paintings, richter, had, his, friend, blinky, palermo, randomly, call, out, colors, which, richter, then, adopted, for, his, work, chance, thus, plays, its, role, in, the, creation, of, his, first, series, returning, to, color, charts, in, the, 1970s, richter, changed, his, focus, from, the, readymade, to, the, conceptual, system, developing, mathematical, procedures, for, mixing, colours, and, chance, operations, for, their, placement, the, range, of, the, colors, he, employed, was, determined, by, a, mathematical, system, for, mixing, the, primary, colors, in, graduated, amounts, each, color, was, then, randomly, ordered, to, create, the, resultant, composition, and, form, of, the, painting, richter, s, second, series, of, color, charts, was, begun, in, 1971, and, consisted, of, only, five, paintings, in, the, final, series, of, color, charts, which, preoccupied, richter, throughout, 1973, and, 1974, additional, elements, to, this, permutational, system, of, color, production, were, added, in, the, form, of, mixes, of, a, light, grey, a, dark, gray, and, later, a, green, richter, s, 4900, colours, from, 2007, consisted, of, bright, monochrome, squares, that, have, been, randomly, arranged, in, a, grid, pattern, to, create, stunning, fields, of, kaleidoscopic, color, it, was, produced, at, the, same, time, he, developed, his, design, for, the, south, transept, window, of, cologne, cathedral, 4900, colours, consists, of, 196, panels, in, 25, colors, that, can, be, reassembled, in, 11, variations, from, a, single, expansive, surface, to, multiple, small, format, fields, richter, developed, version, ii, 49, paintings, each, of, which, measures, 97, by, 97, centimeters, especially, for, the, serpentine, gallery, richter, began, to, use, glass, in, his, work, in, 1967, when, he, made, four, panes, of, glass, these, plain, sheets, of, glass, could, tilt, away, from, the, poles, on, which, they, were, mounted, at, an, angle, that, changed, from, one, installation, to, the, next, in, 1970, he, and, blinky, palermo, jointly, submitted, designs, for, the, sports, facilities, for, the, 1972, olympic, games, in, munich, for, the, front, of, the, arena, they, proposed, an, array, of, glass, windows, in, twenty, seven, different, colors, each, color, would, appear, fifty, times, with, the, distribution, determined, randomly, in, 1981, for, a, two, person, show, with, georg, baselitz, in, d, sseldorf, richter, produced, the, first, of, the, monumental, transparent, mirrors, that, appear, intermittently, thereafter, in, his, oeuvre, the, mirrors, are, significantly, larger, than, richter, s, paintings, and, feature, adjustable, steel, mounts, for, pieces, such, as, mirror, painting, grey, 735, 2, 1991, the, mirrors, were, coloured, grey, by, the, pigment, attached, to, the, back, of, the, glass, arranged, in, two, rooms, richter, presented, an, ensemble, of, paintings, and, colored, mirrors, in, a, special, pavilion, designed, in, collaboration, with, architect, paul, robbrecht, at, documenta, 9, in, kassel, in, 1992, in, 2002, for, the, dia, art, foundation, richter, created, a, glass, sculpture, in, which, seven, parallel, panes, of, glass, refract, light, and, the, world, beyond, offering, altered, visions, of, the, exhibition, space, spiegel, i, mirror, i, and, spiegel, ii, mirror, ii, a, two, part, mirror, piece, from, 1989, that, measures, 7, tall, and, 18, feet, long, which, alters, the, boundaries, of, the, environment, and, again, changes, one, s, visual, experience, of, the, gallery, and, kugel,
