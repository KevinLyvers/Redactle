along, kenya, s, border, with, german, tanganyika, and, karen, helped, transport, supplies, the, war, led, to, a, shortage, of, workers, and, supplies, nevertheless, in, 1916, the, karen, coffee,

there, were, also, wakamba, kavirondo, swahili, and, masai, initially, bror, worked, the, farm, but, it, soon, became, evident, that, he, had, little, interest, in, it, and, preferred, to, leave,

one, had, only, found, in, dreams, blixen, and, her, husband, were, quite, different, in, education, and, temperament, and, bror, blixen, was, unfaithful, to, his, wife, according, to, peter, capstick, it, was, not, long, after, blixen, and, his, wife, settled, on, their, farm, that, he, started, womanizing, capstick, goes, on, to, say, his, forays, into, town, and, his, often, wild, socializing, at, the, muthaiga, club, coupled, with, a, legendary, indiscipline, when, it, came, to, money, and, honoring, his, debts, soon, gave, the, charming, swede, a, notorious, reputation, as, a, consequence, she, was, diagnosed, with, syphilis, according, to, her, biographer, judith, thurman, she, herself, attributed, her, symptoms, in, a, letter, to, her, brother, thomas, to, syphilis, acquired, at, 29, years, old, from, her, husband, toward, the, end, of, their, first, year, of, marriage, in, 1915, however, later, in, life, her, medical, records, do, not, support, that, diagnosis, she, had, been, locally, prescribed, mercury, and, arsenic, a, treatment, for, the, disease, in, her, time, it, is, now, believed, that, some, of, her, later, symptoms, were, the, result, of, heavy, metal, poisoning, at, her, farm, she, also, used, to, take, care, of, local, sick, persons, including, those, suffering, from, fever, variola, meningitis, and, typhus, she, returned, to, denmark, in, june, 1915, for, treatment, which, proved, successful, although, blixen, s, illness, was, eventually, cured, some, uncertainty, exists, it, created, medical, anguish, for, years, to, come, on, 5, april, 1918, bror, and, karen, were, introduced, at, the, muthaiga, club, to, the, english, big, game, hunter, denys, finch, hatton, 1887, 1931, soon, afterwards, he, was, assigned, to, military, service, in, egypt, by, 1919, the, marriage, had, run, into, difficulties, causing, her, husband, to, request, a, divorce, in, 1920, bror, was, dismissed, as, the, farm, manager, by, their, uncle,

friendship, with, karen, and, bror, he, left, africa, again, in, 1920, against, her, wishes, bror, and, karen, separated, in, 1921, finch, hatton, often, travelled, back, and, forth, between, africa,

developed, a, close, friendship, which, eventually, became, a, long, term, love, affair, in, a, letter, to, her, brother, thomas, in, 1924, she, wrote, i, believe, that, for, all, time, and, eternity, i, am, bound, to, denys, to, love, the, ground, he, walks, upon, to, be, happy, beyond, words, when, he, is, here, and, to, suffer, worse, than, death, many, times, when, he, leaves, but, other, letters, in, her, collections, show, that, the, relationship, was, unstable, and, that, karen, s, increasing, dependence, upon, finch, hatton, who, was, intensely, independent, was, an, issue, karen, and, bror, were, officially, divorced, in, 1925, karen, would, go, to, government, house, where, she, had, befriended, joan, grigg, who, was, the, bored, wife, of, the, governor, grigg, would, in,

biplane, in, march, 1931, karen, blixen, wrote, about, their, last, meeting, and, subsequent, parting, when, he, had, started, in, his, car, for, the, aerodrome, in, nairobi, and, had, turned, down, the, drive, he, came, back, to, look, for, a, volume, of, poems, that, he, had, given, to, me, and, now, wanted, on, his, journey, he, stood, with, one, foot, on, the, running, board, of, the, car, and, a, finger, in, the, book, reading, out, to, me, a, poem, we, had, been, discussing, here, are, your, grey, geese, he, said, i, saw, grey, geese, flying, over, the, flatlands, wild, geese, vibrant, in, the, high, air, unswerving, from, horizon, to, horizon, with, their, soul, stiffened, out, in, their, throats, and, the, grey, whiteness, of, them, ribboning, the, enormous, skies, and, the, spokes, of, the, sun, over, the, crumpled, hills, then, he, drove, away, for, good, waving, his, arm, to, me, at, the, same, time, the, failure, of, the, coffee, plantation, as, a, result, of, mismanagement, the, height, of, the, farm, drought, and, the, falling, price, of, coffee, caused, by, the, worldwide, economic, depression, forced, blixen, to, abandon, her, estate, the, family, corporation, sold, the, land, to, a, residential, developer, and, blixen, returned, to, denmark, in, august, 1931, to, live, with, her, mother, in, the, second, world, war, she, helped, jews, escape, out, of, german, occupied, denmark, she, remained, in, rungstedlund, for, the, rest, of, her, life, while, still, in, kenya, blixen, had, written, to, her, brother, thomas, i, have, begun, to, do, what, we, brothers, and, sisters, do, when, we, don, t, know, what, else, to, resort, to, i, have, started, to, write, a, book, i, have, been, writing, in, english, because, i, thought, it, would, be, more, profitable, upon, returning, to, denmark, aged, 46, she, continued, writing, in, earnest, though, her, first, book, seven, gothic, tales, was, completed, in, 1933, she, had, difficulty, finding, a, publisher, and, used, her, brother, s, contacts, with, dorothy, canfield, to, help, the, book, was, published, in, the, united, states, in, 1934, under, the, pseudonym, isak, dinesen, though, the, publisher, refused, to, give, blixen, an, advance, and, discouraged, the, use, of, a, pseudonym, when, it, was, chosen, as, a, book, of, the, month, club, selection, sales, skyrocketed, this, first, book, highly, enigmatic, and, more, metaphoric, than, gothic, won, wide, recognition, in, the, united, states, and, publication, of, the, book, in, the, united, kingdom, and, denmark, followed, though, with, difficulty, unable, to, find, a, translator, she, was, satisfied, with, blixen, prepared, the, danish, versions, herself, though, they, are, not, translations, but, rather, versions, of, the, stories, with, differing, details, blixen, s, explanation, for, the, difference, was, that, she, very, much, wanted, it, to, be, published, in, danish, as, an, original, danish, book, and, not, in, any, no, matter, how, good, translation, the, danish, critics, were, not, enthusiastic, about, the, book, and, were, annoyed, according, to, blixen, that, it, had, first, been, published, abroad, blixen, never, again, published, a, book, in, english, first, all, her, later, books, were, either, published, first, in, danish, or, published, simultaneously, in, danish, and, english, her, second, book, now, the, best, known, of, her, works, out, of, africa, was, published, in, 1937, its, success, firmly, established, her, reputation, having, learned, from, her, previous, experience, blixen, published, the, book, first, in, denmark, and, the, united, kingdom, and, then, in, the, united, states, garnering, another, book, of, the, month, club, choice, blixen, was, assured, of, not, only, sales, for, this, new, work, but, also, renewed, interest, in, seven, gothic, tales, she, was, awarded, the, tagea, brandt, rejselegat, a, danish, prize, for, women, in, the, arts, or, academic, life, in, 1939, the, work, brought, attention, from, critics, who, were, concerned, not, only, with, literary, appraisal, of, the, book, but, also, with, defining, blixen, s, intentions, and, morality, post, colonial, criticism, has, linked, her, with, contemporary, british, writers, and, in, some, cases, branded, her, as, just, another, morally, bankrupt, white, european, aristocrat, danish, scholars, have, not, typically, made, judgments, about, her, morality, perhaps, understanding, that, while, colonial, prejudices, and, elements, of, racism, are, inherent, in, the, work, given, the, context, and, era, nevertheless, her, position, as, an, outsider, a, dane, and, a, woman, makes, evaluating, her, more, complex, some, critics, including, carolyn, martin, shaw, and, raoul, granqvist, have, judged, her, to, be, a, racist, and, a, white, supremacist, while, other, critics, such, as, abdul, r, janmohamed, have, recognized, both, her, romanticized, colonial, attitudes, and, her, understanding, of, colonial, problems, as, well, as, her, concern, and, respect, for, african, nationalists, five, years, after, the, publication, of, out, of, africa, blixen, published, a, collection, of, short, stories, called, winter, s, tales, 1942, danish, vinter, eventyr, a, departure, from, her, previous, gothic, works, the, stories, reflect, the, starkness, of, the, times, occupation, tinged, with, courage, and, pride, and, hope, for, the, future, the, stories, do, not, reflect, resistance, but, resilience, and, explore, the, interdependence, of, opposites, she, examines, shame, versus, pride, in, the, heroine, cowardice, and, courage, in, the, pearls, master, and, servant, in, the, invincible, slave, owners, and, life, versus, death, as, well, as, freedom, versus, imprisonment, in, peter, and, rosa, in, sorrow, acre, the, best, known, story, of, the, collection, blixen, explores, victimization, and, oppression, because, of, the, war, she, had, to, be, creative, about, getting, the, manuscript, published, travelling, to, stockholm, and, meeting, with, employees, at, both, the, american, and, british, embassies, the, americans, were, unable, to, ship, personal, items, but, the, british, embassy, agreed, shipping, the, document, to, her, publisher, in, the, united, states, blixen, did, not, receive, further, communication, about, winter, s, tales, until, after, the, war, ended, when, she, received, correspondence, praising, the, stories, from, american, troops, who, had, read, them, in, the, armed, services, editions, during, the, conflict, blixen, worked, on, a, novel, she, called, albondocani, for, many, years, hoping, to, produce, a, volume, in, the, style, of, les, hommes, de, bonne, volont, by, jules, romains, with, interwoven, stories, across, several, volumes, the, main, character, harun, al, rashid, was, taken, from, one, thousand, and, one, nights, she, worked, on, several, collections, at, once, categorizing, them, according, to, their, themes, and, whether, she, thought, they, were, mostly, to, make, money, or, literary, she, jumped, between, writing, the, collections, of, stories, for, albondocani, to, anecdotes, of, destiny, to, new, gothic, tales, and, new, winter, s, tales, almost, all, of, blixen, s, tales, from, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, follow, a, traditional, style, of, storytelling, weaving, gothic, themes, such, as, incest, and, murder, with, myth, and, bewitchment, as, a, means, of, exploring, identity, morality, and, philosophy, most, also, take, place, against, the, background, of, the, 19th, century, or, earlier, periods, concerning, her, deliberately, old, fashioned, style, blixen, mentioned, in, several, interviews, that, she, wanted, to, express, a, spirit, that, no, longer, existed, in, modern, times, one, of, being, rather, than, doing, her, narratives, hover, between, skillfully, crafted, illusion, and, romanticism, with, a, keen, knowledge, of, the, preferred, tastes, of, her, audience, blixen, crafted, her, english, tales, in, a, more, direct, manner, and, her, danish, tales, in, a, 19th, century, writing, style, which, she, felt, would, appeal, more, to, them, because, she, simultaneously, worked, on, different, collections, works, written, in, this, period, were, not, published, until, almost, a, decade, after, they, were, originally, written, during, world, war, ii, when, denmark, was, occupied, by, the, germans, blixen, started, her, only, full, length, novel, the, introspective, tale, the, angelic, avengers, under, a, french, pseudonym, pierre, andrezel, for, the, first, and, last, time, though, it, was, written, in, danish, she, claimed, that, it, was, a, translation, of, a, french, work, written, between, the, wars, and, denied, being, its, author, the, book, was, published, in, 1944, and, nominated, for, a, third, book, of, the, month, club, selection, blixen, initially, did, not, want, the, book, to, be, nominated, but, eventually, accepted, the, distinction, the, horrors, experienced, by, the, young, heroines, have, been, interpreted, as, an, allegory, of, nazism, though, blixen, also, denied, that, interpretation, claiming, instead, that, the, novel, was, a, distraction, that, had, helped, her, to, escape, the, feeling, of, being, imprisoned, by, the, war, in, 1956, in, an, interview, for, the, paris, review, she, finally, acknowledged, that, she, was, the, author, of, the, novel, saying, that, it, was, her, illegitimate, child, dorothy, canfield, described, the, angelic, avengers, in, her, book, of, the, month, club, news, review, as, of, superlatively, fine, literary, quality, written, with, distinction, in, an, exquisite, style, a, collection, of, stories, last, tales, danish, sidste, fort, llinger, was, published, in, 1957, followed, in, 1958, by, the, collection, anecdotes, of, destiny, danish, sk, bne, anekdoter, last, tales, included, seven, stories, that, blixen, had, intended, to, be, parts, of, albondocani, it, also, included, sections, called, new, gothic, tales, and, new, winter, s, tales, blixen, s, concept, of, the, art, of, the, story, is, perhaps, most, directly, expressed, in, the, stories, the, blank, page, and, the, cardinal, s, first, tale, in, last, tales, these, tales, feature, many, innuendos, which, blixen, employed, to, force, her, reader, into, participating, in, the, creation, of, the, story, she, mixed, obscure, references, with, explicit, observation, her, writing, was, not, just, a, retelling, of, tales, however, it, was, a, complex, layering, of, clues, and, double, entendres, which, force, the, reader, to, deduce, blixen, s, intent, and, draw, conclusions, the, story, for, blixen, was, vital, to, expression, it, gives, a, recitation, of, experience, and, simultaneously, a, potential, vision, of, the, possible, blixen, planned, for, anecdotes, of, destiny, to, be, a, final, part, of, the, last, tales, in, 1953, but, as, she, prepared, all, the, stories, she, decided, to, publish, anecdotes, as, a, separate, volume, she, wanted, both, books, to, appear, simultaneously, but, because, of, publication, issues, anecdotes, was, delayed, for, another, year, the, most, famous, tale, from, anecdotes, is, babette, s, feast, about, a, chef, who, spends, her, entire, 10, 000, franc, lottery, prize, to, prepare, a, final, spectacular, gourmet, meal, the, story, evaluates, relationships, and, examines, whether, the, austere, but, charitable, life, led, by, the, sisters, in, adherence, to, an, ideal, is, less, true, to, faith, than, the, passionate, gift, from, the, heart, of, their, housekeeper, the, story, was, reproduced, in, a, film, directed, and, written, by, gabriel, axel, which, was, released, in, 1987, and, won, the, best, foreign, film, oscar, in, 1988, in, 1959, blixen, made, her, only, trip, to, the, united, states, it, was, an, extended, trip, spanning, from, january, to, april, and,
