returned, to, the, congo, on, 12, june, 1960, the, following, day, he, appointed, lumumba, to, serve, as, the, delegate, informateur, tasked, with, investigating, the, possibility, of, forming, a, national, unity, government, that, included, politicians, with, a, wide, range, of, views, with, 16, june, 1960, as, his, deadline, the, same, day, as, lumumba, s, appointment, the, parliamentary, opposition, coalition, the, cartel, d, union, nationale, was, announced, though, kasa, vubu, was, aligned, with, their, beliefs, he, remained, distanced, from, them, the, mnc, l, was, also, having, trouble, securing, the, allegiances, of, the, psa, cerea, centre, de, regroupement, africain, and, balubakat, association, g, n, rale, des, baluba, du, katanga, initially, lumumba, was, unable, to,

reported, his, difficulties, to, ganshof, who, extended, the, deadline, and, promised, to, act, as, an, intermediary, between, the, mnc, l, leader, and, the, opposition, once, ganshof, had, made, contact, with, the, cartel, leadership, he, was, impressed, by, their, obstinacy, and, assurances, of, a, strong, anti, lumumba, polity, by, evening, lumumba, s, mission, was, showing, even, less, chance, of, succeeding, ganshof, considered, extending, the, role, of, informateur, to, cyrille, adoula, and, kasa, vubu, but, faced, increasing, pressure, from, belgian, and, moderate, congolese, advisers, to, end, lumumba, s, assignment, the, following, day, on, 17, june, 1960, ganshof, declared, that, lumumba, had, failed, and, terminated, his, mission, acting, on, ganshof, s, advice, baudouin, then, named, kasa, vubu, formateur, lumumba, responded, by, threatening, to, form, his, own, government, and, present, it, to, parliament, without, official, approval, he, called, a, meeting, at, the, ok, bar, in, l, opoldville, where, he, announced, the, creation, of, a, popular, government, with, the, support, of, pierre, mulele, of, the, psa, meanwhile, kasa, vubu, like, lumumba, was, unable, to, communicate, with, his, political, opponents, he, assumed, that, he, would, secure, the, presidency, so, he, began, looking, for, someone, to, serve, as, his, prime, minister, most, of, the, candidates, he, considered, were, friends, who, had, foreign, support, similar, to, his, own, including, albert, kalonji, joseph, il, o, cyrille, adoula, and, justin, bomboko, kasa, vubu, was, slow, to, come, to, a, final, decision, on, 18, june, 1960, kasa, vubu, announced, that, he, had, completed, his, government, with, all, parties, except, the, mnc, l, that, afternoon, jason, sendwe, antoine, gizenga, and, anicet, kashamura, announced, in, the, presence, of, lumumba, that, their, respective, parties, were, not, committed, to, the, government, the, next, day, on, 19, june, 1960, ganshof, summoned, kasa, vubu, and, lumumba, to, a, meeting, so, they, could, forge, a, compromise, this, failed, when, lumumba, flatly, refused, the, position, of, prime, minister, in, a, kasa, vubu, government, the, following, day, on, 20, june, 1960, the, two, rivals, met, in, the, presence, of, adoula, and, diplomats, from, israel, and, ghana, but, no, agreement, was, reached, most, party, leaders, refused, to, support, a, government, that, did, not, include, lumumba, the, decision, to, make, kasa, vubu, the, formateur, was, a, catalyst, that, rallied, the, psa, cerea, and, balubakat, to, lumumba, making, it, unlikely, that, kasa, vubu, could, form, a, government, that, would, survive, a, vote, of, confidence, when, the, chamber, met, on, 21, june, 1960, to, select, its, officers, joseph, kasongo, of, the, mnc, l, was, elected, president, with, 74, votes, a, majority, while, the, two, vice, presidencies, were, secured, by, the, psa, and, cerea, candidates, both, of, whom, had, the, support, of, lumumba, with, time, running, out, before, independence, baudouin, took, new, advice, from, ganshof, and, appointed, lumumba, as, formateur, once, it, was, apparent, that, lumumba, s, bloc, controlled, parliament, several, members, of, the, opposition, became, eager, to, negotiate, for, a, coalition, government, in, order, to, share, power, by, 22, june, 1960, lumumba, had, a, government, list, but, negotiations, continued, with, jean, bolikango, albert, delvaux, and, kasa, vubu, lumumba, reportedly, offered, the, alliance, of, bakongo, abako, the, ministerial, positions, for, foreign, affairs, and, middle, classes, but, kasa, vubu, instead, demanded, the, ministry, of, finance, a, minister, of, state, the, secretary, of, state, for, the, interior, and, a, written, pledge, of, support, from, the, mnc, l, and, its, allies, for, his, presidential, candidacy, kalonji, was, presented, with, the, agriculture, portfolio, by, lumumba, which, he, rejected, although, he, was, suitable, due, to, his, experience, as, an, agricultural, engineer, adoula, was, also, offered, a, ministerial, position, but, refused, to, accept, it, by, the, morning, of, 23, june, 1960, the, government, was, in, the, words, of, lumumba, practically, formed, at, noon, he, made, a, counter, offer, to, kasa, vubu, who, instead, responded, with, a, letter, demanding, the, creation, of, a, seventh, province, for, the, bakongo, lumumba, refused, to, comply, and, instead, pledged, to, support, jean, bolikango, in, his, bid, for, the, presidency, at, 14, 45, lumumba, presented, his, proposed, government, before, the, press, neither, the, abako, nor, the, mnc, kalonji, mnc, k, were, represented, among, the, ministers, and, the, only, psa, members, were, from, gizenga, s, wing, of, the, party, the, bakongo, of, l, opoldville, were, deeply, upset, by, their, exclusion, from, lumumba, s, cabinet, they, subsequently, demanded, the, removal, of, the, psa, dominated, provincial, government, and, called, for, a, general, strike, to, begin, the, following, morning, at, 16, 00, lumumba, and, kasa, vubu, resumed, negotiations, kasa, vubu, eventually, agreed, to, lumumba, s, earlier, offer, though, lumumba, informed, him, that, he, could, not, give, him, a, guarantee, of, support, in, his, presidential, candidacy, the, resulting, 37, strong, lumumba, government, was, very, diverse, with, its, members, coming, from, different, classes, different, tribes, and, holding, varied, political, beliefs, though, many, had, questionable, loyalty, to, lumumba, most, did, not, openly, contradict, him, out, of, political, considerations, or, fear, of, reprisal, at, 22, 40, on, 23, june, 1960, the, chamber, of, deputies, convened, in, the, palais, de, la, nation, to, vote, on, lumumba, s, government, after, kasongo, opened, the, session, lumumba, delivered, his, main, speech, promising, to, maintain, national, unity, abide, by, the, will, of, the, people, and, pursue, a, neutralist, foreign, policy, it, was, warmly, received, by, most, deputies, and, observers, the, chamber, proceeded, to, engage, in, a, heated, debate, though, the, government, contained, members, from, parties, that, held, 120, of, the, 137, seats, reaching, a, majority, was, not, a, straightforward, task, while, several, leaders, of, the, opposition, had, been, involved, in, the, formative, negotiations, their, parties, as, a, whole, had, not, been, consulted, furthermore, some, individuals, were, upset, they, had, not, been, included, in, the, government, and, sought, to, personally, prevent, its, investiture, in, the, subsequent, arguments, multiple, deputies, expressed, dissatisfaction, at, the, lack, of, representation, of, their, respective, provinces, and, or, parties, with, several, threatening, secession, among, them, was, kalonji, who, said, he, would, encourage, people, of, kasa, to, refrain, from, participating, in, the, central, government, and, form, their, own, autonomous, state, one, katangese, deputy, objected, to, the, same, person, being, appointed, as, premier, and, as, head, of, the, defence, portfolio, when, a, vote, was, finally, taken, only, 80, of, the, 137, members, of, the, chamber, were, present, of, these, 74, voted, in, favour, of, the, government, five, against, and, one, abstained, the, 57, absences, were, almost, all, voluntary, though, the, government, had, earned, just, as, many, votes, as, when, kasongo, won, the, presidency, of, the, chamber, the, support, was, not, congruent, members, of, cl, ophas, kamitatu, s, wing, of, the, psa, had, voted, against, the, government, while, a, few, members, of, the, pnp, puna, and, abako, voted, in, favour, of, it, overall, the, vote, was, a, disappointment, for, the, mnc, l, coalition, the, session, was, adjourned, at, 02, 05, on, 24, june, 1960, the, senate, convened, that, day, to, vote, on, the, government, there, was, another, heated, debate, in, which, il, o, and, adoula, expressed, their, strong, dissatisfaction, with, its, composition, confederation, of, tribal, associations, of, katanga, conakat, members, abstained, from, voting, when, arguments, concluded, a, decisive, vote, of, approval, was, taken, on, the, government, 60, voted, in, favour, 12, against, while, eight, abstained, all, dissident, arguments, for, alternative, cabinets, particularly, kalonji, s, demand, for, a, new, administration, were, rendered, impotent, and, the, lumumba, government, was, officially, invested, with, the, institution, of, a, broad, coalition, the, parliamentary, opposition, was, officially, reduced, to, only, the, mnc, k, and, some, individuals, at, the, onset, of, his, premiership, lumumba, had, two, main, goals, to, ensure, that, independence, would, bring, a, legitimate, improvement, in, the, quality, of, life, for, the, congolese, and, to, unify, the, country, as, a, centralised, state, by, eliminating, tribalism, and, regionalism, he, was, worried, that, opposition, to, his, government, would, appear, rapidly, and, would, have, to, be, managed, quickly, and, decisively, to, achieve, the, first, aim, lumumba, believed, that, a, comprehensive, africanisation, of, the, administration, in, spite, of, its, risks, would, be, necessary, the, belgians, were, opposed, to, such, an, idea, as, it, would, create, inefficiency, in, the, congo, s, bureaucracy, and, lead, to, a, mass, exodus, of, unemployed, civil, servants, to, belgium, whom, they, would, be, unable, to, absorb, into, the, government, there, it, was, too, late, for, lumumba, to, enact, africanisation, before, independence, seeking, another, gesture, that, might, excite, the, congolese, people, lumumba, proposed, to, the, belgian, government, a, reduction, in, sentences, for, all, prisoners, and, an, amnesty, for, those, serving, a, term, of, three, years, or, less, ganshof, feared, that, such, an, action, would, jeopardise, law, and, order, and, he, evaded, taking, any, action, until, it, was, too, late, to, fulfill, the, request, lumumba, s, opinion, of, the, belgians, was, soured, by, this, affair, which, contributed, to, his, fear, that, independence, would, not, appear, real, to, the, average, congolese, in, seeking, to, eliminate, tribalism, and, regionalism, in, the, congo, lumumba, was, deeply, inspired, by, the, personality, and, undertakings, of, kwame, nkrumah, and, by, ghanaian, ideas, of, the, leadership, necessary, in, post, colonial, africa, he, worked, to, seek, such, changes, through, the, mnc, lumumba, intended, to, combine, it, with, its, parliamentary, allies, cerea, the, psa, and, possibly, balubakat, to, form, one, national, party, and, to, build, a, following, in, each, province, he, hoped, it, would, absorb, other, parties, and, become, a, unifying, force, for, the, country, independence, day, was, celebrated, on, 30, june, 1960, in, a, ceremony, attended, by, many, dignitaries, including, king, baudouin, of, belgium, and, the, foreign, press, baudouin, s, speech, praised, developments, under, colonialism, his, reference, to, the, genius, of, his, great, granduncle, leopold, ii, of, belgium, glossing, over, atrocities, committed, during, his, reign, over, the, congo, free, state, the, king, continued, don, t, compromise, the, future, with, hasty, reforms, and, don, t, replace, the, structures, that, belgium, hands, over, to, you, until, you, are, sure, you, can, do, better, don, t, be, afraid, to, come, to, us, we, will, remain, by, your, side, give, you, advice, lumumba, who, had, not, been, scheduled, to, speak, delivered, an, impromptu, speech, that, reminded, the, audience, that, the, independence, of, the, congo, had, not, been, granted, magnanimously, by, belgium, for, this, independence, of, the, congo, although, being, proclaimed, today, by, agreement, with, belgium, an, amicable, country, with, which, we, are, on, equal, terms, no, congolese, worthy, of, the, name, will, ever, be, able, to, forget, that, it, was, by, fighting, that, it, has, been, won, a, day, to, day, fight, an, ardent, and, idealistic, fight, a, fight, in, which, we, were, spared, neither, privation, nor, suffering, and, for, which, we, gave, our, strength, and, our, blood, we, are, proud, of, this, struggle, of, tears, of, fire, and, of, blood, to, the, depths, of, our, being, for, it, was, a, noble, and, just, struggle, and, indispensable, to, put, an, end, to, the, humiliating, slavery, which, was, imposed, upon, us, by, force, most, european, journalists, were, shocked, by, the, stridency, of, lumumba, s, speech, the, western, media, criticised, him, time, magazine, characterised, his, speech, as, a, vicious, attack, every, morning, at, seven, o, clock, he, sat, at, the, huge, desk, embellished, with, the, forgotten, coat, of, arms, of, colonial, belgium, a, golden, lion, in, a, blue, shield, there, the, premier, first, received, his, immediate, assistants, set, up, the, schedule, for, the, day, went, over, correspondence, which, he, answered, without, a, stop, until, evening, he, was, receiving, salesmen, petitioners, donors, experts, businessmen, and, diplomats, the, most, variegated, crowd, that, ever, walked, on, the, market, everybody, wanted, to, deal, exclusively, with, lumumba, prime, minister, s, press, secretary, serge, michel, independence, day, and, the, three, days, that, followed, it, were, declared, a, national, holiday, the, congolese, were, preoccupied, by, the, festivities, which, were, conducted, in, relative, peace, meanwhile, lumumba, s, office, was, overtaken, by, a, flurry, of, activity, a, diverse, group, of, individuals, congolese, and, european, some, friends, and, relatives, hurried, about, their, work, some, undertook, specific, missions, on, his, behalf, sometimes, without, direct, permission, numerous, congolese, citizens, showed, up, at, the, office, at, whim, for, various, reasons, lumumba, for, his, part, was, mostly, preoccupied, with, a, lengthy, itinerary, of, receptions, and, ceremonies, on, 3, july, lumumba, declared, a, general, amnesty, for, prisoners, but, it, was, never, implemented, the, following, morning, he, convened, the, council, of, ministers, to, discuss, the, unrest, among, the, troops, of, the, force, publique, many, soldiers, hoped, that, independence, would, result, in, immediate, promotions, and, material, gains, but, were, disappointed, by, lumumba, s, slow, pace, of, reform, the, rank, and, file, felt, that, the, congolese, political, class, particularly, ministers, in, the, new, government, were, enriching, themselves, while, failing, to, improve, the, troops, situation, many, of, the, soldiers, were, also, fatigued, from, maintaining, order, during, the, elections, and, participating, in, independence, celebrations, the, ministers, decided, to, establish, four, committees, to, study, respectively, the, reorganisation, of, the, administration, the, judiciary, and, the, army, and, the, enacting, of, a, new, statute, for, state, employees, all, were, to, devote, special, attention, to, ending, racial, discrimination, parliament, assembled, for, the, first, time, since, independence, and, took, its, first, official, legislative, action, by, voting, to, increase, the, salaries, of, its, members, to, fc, 500, 000, lumumba, fearing, the, repercussions, the, raise, would, have, on, the, budget, was, among, the, few, to, object, dubbing, it, a, ruinous, folly, on, the, morning, of, 5, july, 1960, general, mile, janssens, commander, of, the, force, publique, in, response, to, increasing, excitement, among, the, congolese, ranks, summoned, all, troops, on, duty, at, camp, l, opold, ii, he,

to, the, provincial, presidents, were, almost, certainly, forgeries, despite, the, coup, african, diplomats, still, worked, towards, a, reconciliation, between, lumumba, and, kasa, vubu, according, to, the, ghanaians, a, verbal, agreement, of, principle, concerning, closer, co, operation, between, the, head, of, state, and, the, government, was, put, into, writing, lumumba, signed, it, but,

both, belgium, and, the, united, states, perception, of, lumumba, as, they, feared, he, was, increasingly, subject, to, communist, influence, due, to, his, appeals, for, soviet, aid, however, according, to, journalist, sean, kelly, who, covered, the, events, as, a, correspondent, for, the, voice, of, america, lumumba, did, this, not, because, he, was, a, communist, but, because, he, felt, that, the, soviet, union, was, the, only, power, which, would, support, his, government, s, effort, to, defeat, belgian, supported, separatists, and, rid, itself, of, colonial, influence, the, us, was, the, first, country, from, which, lumumba, requested, help, lumumba, for, his, part, denied, being, a, communist, stating, that, he, found, colonialism, and, communism, to, be, equally,

displayed, a, bullet, and, two, teeth, that, he, claimed, he, had, saved, from, lumumba, s, body, which, included, a, gold, capped, tooth, according, to, the, 2001, belgian, commission, investigating,

also, following, belgian, government, policy, and, orders, the, belgian, minister, of, african, affairs, count, harold, d, aspremont, lynden, who, had, been, tasked, with, organising, katanga, s, secession, on, 6, october, 1960, sent, a, cable, to, katanga, saying, that, policy, from, now, on, would, be, the, definitive, elimination, of, patrice, lumumba, lynden, had, also, insisted, on, 15, january, 1961, that, an, imprisoned, lumumba, should, be, sent, to, katanga, which, essentially, would, have, been, a, death, sentence, the, 2001, report, by, the, belgian, commission, describes, previous, u, s, and, belgian, plots, to, kill, lumumba, among, them, was, a, central, intelligence, agency, sponsored, attempt, to, poison, him, us, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, authorised, the,

be, used, for, the, assassination, in, september, 1960, gottlieb, brought, a, vial, of, the, poison, to, the, congo, and, devlin, developed, plans, to, place, it, on, lumumba, s, toothbrush, or, in, his, food, the, plot, was, abandoned, because, cia, station, chief, larry, devlin, s, agent, was, unable, to, carry, out, the, assassination, and, the, replacement, agent, justin, o, donnell, refused, to, participate, in, an, assassination, plot, according, to, madeleine, g, kalb, in, her, book, congo, cables, many, communications, by, devlin, at, the, time, urged, the, elimination, of, lumumba, michael, p, holt, writes, that, devlin, also, helped, to, direct, the, search, to, capture, lumumba, and, also, helped, arrange, his, transfer, to, the, separatist, authorities, in, katanga, john, stockwell, a, cia, officer, in, the, congo, and, later, a, cia, station, chief, wrote, in, 1978, that, the, cia, base, chief, in, elizabethville, was, in, direct, contact, with, lumumba, s, killers, on, the, night, he, was, executed, stockwell, also, wrote, that, a, cia, agent, had, a, body, in, the, trunk, of, his, car, that, they, were, trying, dispose, of, stockwell, who, knew, devlin, well, believed, that, devlin, knew, more, than, anyone, else, about, the, murder, the, inauguration, of, john, f, kennedy, in, january, 1961, caused, fear, among, mobutu, s, faction, and, within, the, cia, that, the, incoming, kennedy, administration, would, favour, the, imprisoned, lumumba, while, awaiting, his, presidential, inauguration, kennedy, had, come, to, believe, that, lumumba, should, be, released, from, custody, though, not, be, allowed, to, return, to, power, lumumba, was, killed, three, days, before, kennedy, s, inauguration, on, 20, january, though, kennedy, did, not, learn, of, the, killing, until, 13, february, kennedy, was, informed, by, united, nations, ambassador, adlai, stevenson, and, according, to, jacques, lowe, who, was, with, him, at, the, time, his, hand, went, to, his, head, in, utter, despair, oh, no, i, heard, him, groan, in, 1975, the, church, committee, went, on, record, with, the, finding, that, cia, chief, allen, dulles, had, ordered, lumumba, s, assassination, as, an, urgent, and, prime, objective, furthermore, declassified, cia, cables, quoted, or, mentioned, in, the, church, report, and, in, kalb, 1982, mention, two, specific, cia, plots, to, murder, lumumba, the, poison, plot, and, a, shooting, plot, the, committee, later, found, that, while, the, cia, had, conspired, to, kill, lumumba, it, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, murder, in, the, early, 21st, century, declassified, documents, revealed, that, the, cia, had, plotted, to, assassinate, lumumba, the, documents, indicate, that, the, congolese, leaders, who, overthrew, lumumba, and, transferred, him, to, the, katangan, authorities, including, mobutu, sese, seko, and, joseph, kasa, vubu, received, money, and, weapons, directly, from, the, cia, the, same, disclosure, showed, that, at, the, time, the, u, s, government, believed, that, lumumba, was, a, communist, and, feared, him, because, of, what, it, considered, the, threat, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, cold, war, in, 2000, a, newly, declassified, interview, with, robert, johnson, who, was, the, minutekeeper, of, the, u, s, national, security, council, at, the, time, in, question, revealed, that, u, s, president, eisenhower, had, said, something, to, the, effect, that, lumumba, should, be, eliminated, the, interview, from, the, senate, intelligence, committee, s, inquiry, on, covert, action, was, released, in, august, 2000, in, 2013, the, u, s, state, department, admitted, that, president, eisenhower, discussed, plans, at, a, nsc, meeting, on, 18, august, 1960, to, assassinate, lumumba, however, documents, released, in, 2017, revealed, that, an, american, role, in, lumumba, s, murder, was, only, under, consideration, by, the, cia, cia, chief, allan, dulles, had, allocated, 100, 000, to, accomplish, the, act, but, the, plan, was, not, carried, out, in, june, 2001, newly, discovered, documents, by, de, witte, revealed, that, while, the, us, and, belgium, actively, plotted, to, murder, lumumba, the, british, government, secretly, wanted, him, got, rid, of, because, they, believed, he, posed, a, serious, threat, to, british, interests, in, the, congo, such, as, mining, facilities, in, katanga, howard, smith, who, became, head, of, mi5, in, 1979, said, i, can, see, only, two, possible, solutions, to, the, problem, the, first, is, the, simple, one, of, ensuring, lumumba, s, removal, from, the, scene, by, killing, him, this, should, solve, the, problem, in, april, 2013, in, a, letter, to, the, london, review, of, books, british, parliamentarian, david, lea, reported, having, discussed, lumumba, s, death, with, mi6, officer, daphne, park, shortly, before, she, died, in, march, 2010, park, had, been, posted, to, leopoldville, at, the, time, of, lumumba, s, death, and, was, later, a, semi, official, spokesperson, for, mi6, in, the, house, of, lords, according, to, lea, when, he, mentioned, the, uproar, surrounding, lumumba, s, abduction, and, murder, and, recalled, the, theory, that, mi6, might, have, had, something, to, do, with, it, park, replied, we, did, i, organised, it, the, bbc, reported, that, subsequently, whitehall, sources, described, the, claims, of, mi6, involvement, as, speculative, on, 30, june, 2020, lumumba, s, daughter, juliana, lumumba, appealed, directly, in, a, letter, to, philippe, king, of, the, belgians, the, return, of, the, relics, of, patrice, mery, lumumba, to, the, ground, of, his, ancestors, describing, her, father, as, a, hero, without, a, grave, the, letter, stated, why, after, his, terrible, murder, have, lumumba, s, remains, been, condemned, to, remain, a, soul, forever, wandering, without, a, grave, to, shelter, his, eternal, rest, on, 10, september, 2020, a, belgian, judge, ruled, that, lumumba, s, remains, which, then, consisted, of, just, a, single, gold, capped, tooth, gerard, soete, had, lost, the, other, tooth, of, lumumba, between, 1999, and, 2020, must, be, returned, to, his, family, in, may, 2021, congolese, president, f, lix, tshisekedi, announced, that, there, would, be, a, repatriation, of, the, last, remains, of, lumumba, however, the, handover, ceremony, was, delayed, because, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, on, 9, june, 2022, during, a, speech, in, the, drc, to, the, country, s, parliament, king, philippe, reiterated, regrets, for, belgium, s, colonial, past, in, its, former, colony, describing, belgian, rule, as, a, regime, of, unequal, relations, unjustifiable, in, itself, marked, by, paternalism, discrimination, and, racism, that, led, to, violent, acts, and, humiliations, on, 20, june, lumumba, s, children, received, the, remains, of, their, father, during, a, ceremony, at, egmont, palace, in, brussels, where, the, federal, prosecutor, formally, handed, custody, to, the, family, the, belgian, prime, minister, alexander, de, croo, apologised, on, behalf, of, the, belgian, government, for, his, country, s, role, in, lumumba, s, assassination, for, my, part, i, would, like, to, apologise, here, in, the, presence, of, his, family, for, the, way, in, which, the, belgian, government, influenced, the, decision, to, end, the, life, of, the, country, s, first, prime, minister, a, man, was, murdered, for, his, political, convictions, his, words, his, ideals, he, added, later, the, full, sized, coffin, was, brought, in, public, and, draped, in, the, congolese, flag, for, the, congolese, and, wider, african, diaspora, of, belgium, to, pay, their, respects, before, the, return, lumumba, s, final, resting, place, will, be, in, a, special, mausoleum, in, kinshasa, the, government, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, declared, three, days, of, national, mourning, the, burial, was, to, coincide, with, the, 61st, anniversary, of, his, famous, independence, day, speech, an, investigation, by, belgian, prosecutors, for, war, crimes, related, to, lumumba, s, murder, is, ongoing, his, remains, were, laid, to, rest, 30, june, 2022, lumumba, did, not, espouse, a, comprehensive, political, or, economic, platform, according, to, patricia, goff, lumumba, was, the, first, congolese, to, articulate, a, narrative, of, the, congo, that, contradicted, traditional, belgian, views, of, colonisation, and, he, highlighted, the, suffering, of, the, indigenous, population, under, european, rule, goff, writes, that, lumumba, was, alone, among, his, contemporaries, in, encompassing, all, congolese, people, in, his, narrative, the, others, confined, their, discussions, to, their, respective, ethnicities, or, regions, and, he, offered, a, basis, for, national, identity, that, was, predicated, upon, having, survived, colonial, victimisation, as, well, as, the, people, s, innate, dignity, humanity, strength, and, unity, lumumba, s, ideal, of, humanism, included, the, values, of, egalitarianism, social, justice, liberty, and, the, recognition, of, fundamental, rights, he, viewed, the, state, as, a, positive, advocate, for, the, public, welfare, and, its, intervention, in, congolese, society, necessary, to, ensure, equality, justice, and, social, harmony, full, accounts, of, lumumba, s, life, and, death, were, printed, within, weeks, of, his, demise, beginning, in, 1961, and, continuing, for, several, years, thereafter, some, biographies, on, him, were, published, most, were, highly, partisan, several, early, works, on, the, congo, crisis, also, discussed, lumumba, at, length, in, the, years, after, his, death, misconceptions, of, lumumba, persisted, by, both, his, supporters, and, his, critics, serious, study, of, him, faded, over, the, following, decades, academic, discussion, of, his, legacy, was, largely, limited, until, the, later, stages, of, mobutu, s, rule, in, the, congo, mobutu, s, opening, of, the, country, to, multi, party, politics, beginning, in, 1990, revived, interest, in, lumumba, s, death, belgian, literature, in, the, decades, following, the, congo, crisis, portrayed, him, as, incompetent, demagogic, aggressive, ungrateful, undiplomatic, and, communist, most, africanists, of, the, 20th, century, such, as, jean, claude, willame, viewed, lumumba, as, an, intransigent, unrealistic, idealist, without, any, tangible, programme, who, distanced, himself, from, his, contemporaries, and, alienated, the, western, world, with, radical, anti, colonial, rhetoric, they, saw, him, as, greatly, responsible, for, the, political, crisis, that, resulted, in, his, downfall, a, handful, of, other, writers, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, shared, the, belief, that, lumumba, s, goals, were, unattainable, in, 1960, but, nevertheless, viewed, him, as, a, martyr, of, congolese, independence, at, the, hands, of, certain, western, interests, and, the, victim, of, events, over, which, he, had, little, control, according, to, sociologist, de, witte, both, of, these, perspectives, overstate, the, political, weaknesses, and, isolation, of, lumumba, a, conventional, narrative, of, lumumba, s, premiership, and, downfall, eventually, emerged, he, was, an, uncompromising, radical, who, provoked, his, own, murder, by, angering, domestic, separatists, within, belgium, the, popular, narrative, of, his, death, implicated, the, involvement, of, some, belgian, individuals, but, stressed, that, they, were, acting, under, orders, of, african, figures, and, that, the, belgian, government, was, uninvolved, some, belgian, circles, peddled, the, notion, that, the, united, states, particularly, the, central, intelligence, agency, had, arranged, the, killing, this, narrative, was, challenged, by, de, witte, s, 2001, work, the, assassination, of, patrice, lumumba, which, provided, evidence, that, the, belgian, government, with, the, complicity, of, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, the, un, was, largely, responsible, for, his, death, media, discussion, of, lumumba, spurred, by, the, release, of, the, book, as, well, as, a, feature, film, in, 2000, lumumba, became, significantly, more, positive, afterwards, a, new, narrative, subsequently, emerged, holding, western, espionage, at, fault, for, lumumba, s, death, and, emphasising, the, threat, his, charismatic, appeal, posed, to, western, interests, lumumba, s, role, in, the, congolese, independence, movement, is, well, documented, and, he, is, typically, recognised, as, its, most, important, and, influential, leader, his, exploits, are, usually, celebrated, as, the, work, of, him, as, an, individual, and, not, that, of, a, larger, movement, despite, his, brief, political, career, and, tragic, death, or, perhaps, because, of, them, lumumba, entered, history, through, the, front, door, he, became, both, a, flag, and, a, symbol, he, lived, as, a, free, man, and, an, independent, thinker, everything, he, wrote, said, and, did, was, the, product, of, someone, who, knew, his, vocation, to, be, that, of, a, liberator, and, he, represents, for, the, congo, what, castro, does, for, cuba, nasser, for, egypt, nkrumah, for, ghana, mao, tse, tung, for, china, and, lenin, for, russia, thomas, kanza, friend, and, colleague, of, lumumba, 1972, due, to, his, relatively, short, career, in, government, quick, removal, from, power, and, controversial, death, a, consensus, has, not, been, reached, on, lumumba, s, political, legacy, his, downfall, was, detrimental, to, african, nationalist, movements, and, he, is, generally, remembered, primarily, for, his, assassination, numerous, american, historians, have, cited, his, death, as, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, radicalisation, of, the, american, civil, rights, movement, in, the, 1960s, and, many, african, american, activist, organisations, and, publications, used, public, comment, on, his, death, to, express, their, ideology, popular, memory, of, lumumba, has, often, discarded, his, politics, and, reduced, him, to, a, symbol, within, the, congo, lumumba, is, primarily, portrayed, as, a, symbol, of, national, unity, while, abroad, he, is, usually, cast, as, a, pan, africanist, and, anticolonial, revolutionary, the, ideological, legacy, of, lumumba, is, known, as, lumumbisme, french, for, lumumbism, rather, than, a, complex, doctrine, it, is, usually, framed, as, a, set, of, fundamental, principles, consisting, of, nationalism, pan, africanism, nonalignment, and, social, progressivism, mobutism, built, off, of, these, principles, congolese, university, students, who, had, up, until, independence, held, little, respect, for, lumumba, embraced, lumumbisme, after, his, death, according, to, political, scientist, georges, nzongola, ntalaja, lumumba, s, greatest, legacy, for, the, congo, is, the, ideal, of, national, unity, nzongola, ntalaja, further, posited, that, as, a, result, of, lumumba, s, high, praise, of, the, independence, movement, and, his, work, to, end, the, katangese, secession, the, people, of, the, congo, are, likely, to, remain, steadfast, in, their, defense, of, national, unity, and, territorial, integrity, come, hell, or, high, water, political, scientist, ali, mazrui, wrote, it, looks, as, if, the, memory, of, lumumba, may, contribute, more, to, the, oneness, of, the, congolese, than, anything, lumumba, himself, actually, did, while, he, was, still, alive, following, the, suppression, of, the, rebellions, of, 1964, and, 1965, most, lumumbist, ideology, was, confined, to, isolated, groups, of, intellectuals, who, faced, repression, under, mobutu, s, regime, by, 1966, there, was, little, popular, devotion, to, him, outside, of, the, political, elite, centres, of, lumumba, s, popularity, in, his, lifetime, underwent, a, gradual, decline, in, fidelity, to, his, person, and, ideas, according, to, africanist, bogumil, jewsiewicki, by, 1999, the, only, faithful, surviving, lumumbist, nucleus, is, located, in, sankuru, and, maniema, and, its, loyalty, is, questionable, more, ethnical, regional, and, sentimental, than, ideological, and, political, lumumba, s, image, was, unpopular, in, southern, kasai, for, years, after, his, death, as, many, baluba, remained, aware, of, the, military, campaign, he, ordered, in, august, 1960, that, resulted, in, violent, atrocities, against, their, people, at, least, a, dozen, congolese, political, parties, have, claimed, to, bear, lumumba, s, political, and, spiritual, heritage, despite, this, few, entities, have, attempted, or, succeeded, in, incorporating, his, ideas, into, a, comprehensible, political, program, most, of, these, parties, have, enjoyed, little, electoral, support, though, gizenga, s, parti, lumumbiste, unifi, was, represented, in, the, congolese, coalition, government, formed, under, president, joseph, kabila, in, 2006, aside, from, student, groups, lumumbist, ideals, play, only, a, minor, role, in, current, congolese, politics, congolese, presidents, mobutu, laurent, d, sir, kabila, and, joseph, kabila, all, claimed, to, inherit, lumumba, s, legacy, and, paid, tribute, to, him, early, on, in, their, tenures, ne, thing, is, clear, while, he, lived, he, was, essentially, a, factional, hero, rather, than, a, national, one, but, after, his, death, the, myth, of, lumumba, was, rapidly, nationalized, political, scientist, ali, mazrui, 1968, the, circumstances, of, lumumba, s, death, have, led, him, to, often, be, portrayed, as, a, martyr, while, his, demise, led, to, an, outburst, of, mass, demonstrations, abroad, and, quick, creation, of, a, martyr, image, internationally, the, immediate, reaction, to, his,
