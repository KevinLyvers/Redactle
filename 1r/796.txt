bede, b, i, d, old, english, b, da, 672, 3, 26, may, 735, also, known, as, saint, bede, the, venerable, bede, and, bede, the, venerable, latin, beda, venerabilis, was, an, english, monk, author, and, scholar, he, was, one, of, the, greatest, teachers, and, writers, during, the, early, middle, ages, and, his, most, famous, work, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, gained, him, the, title, the, father, of, english, history, he, served, at, the, monastery, of, st, peter, and, its, companion, monastery, of, st, paul, in, the, kingdom, of, northumbria, of, the, angles, born, on, lands, belonging, to, the, twin, monastery, of, monkwearmouth, jarrow, in, present, day, tyne, and, wear, england, bede, was, sent, to, monkwearmouth, at, the, age, of, seven, and, later, joined, abbot, ceolfrith, at, jarrow, both, of, them, survived, a, plague, that, struck, in, 686, and, killed, the, majority, of, the, population, there, while, bede, spent, most, of, his, life, in, the, monastery, he, travelled, to, several, abbeys, and, monasteries, across, the, british, isles, even, visiting, the, archbishop, of, york, and, king, ceolwulf, of, northumbria, his, ecumenical, writings, were, extensive, and, included, a, number, of, biblical, commentaries, and, other, theological, works, of, exegetical, erudition, another, important, area, of, study, for, bede, was, the, academic, discipline, of, computus, otherwise, known, to, his, contemporaries, as, the, science, of, calculating, calendar, dates, one, of, the, more, important, dates, bede, tried, to, compute, was, easter, an, effort, that, was, mired, in, controversy, he, also, helped, popularize, the, practice, of, dating, forward, from, the, birth, of, christ, anno, domini, in, the, year, of, our, lord, a, practice, which, eventually, became, commonplace, in, medieval, europe, he, is, considered, by, many, historians, to, be, the, most, important, scholar, of, antiquity, for, the, period, between, the, death, of, pope, gregory, i, in, 604, and, the, coronation, of, charlemagne, in, 800, in, 1899, pope, leo, xiii, declared, him, a, doctor, of, the, church, he, is, the, only, native, of, great, britain, to, achieve, this, designation, bede, was, moreover, a, skilled, linguist, and, translator, and, his, work, made, the, latin, and, greek, writings, of, the, early, church, fathers, much, more, accessible, to, his, fellow, anglo, saxons, which, contributed, significantly, to, english, christianity, bede, s, monastery, had, access, to, an, impressive, library, which, included, works, by, eusebius, orosius, and, many, others, almost, everything, that, is, known, of, bede, s, life, is, contained, in, the, last, chapter, of, his, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, a, history, of, the, church, in, england, it, was, completed, in, about, 731, and, bede, implies, that, he, was, then, in, his, fifty, ninth, year, which, would, give, a, birth, date, in, 672, or, 673, a, minor, source, of, information, is, the, letter, by, his, disciple, cuthbert, not, to, be, confused, with, the, saint, cuthbert, who, is, mentioned, in, bede, s, work, which, relates, bede, s, death, bede, in, the, historia, gives, his, birthplace, as, on, the, lands, of, this, monastery, he, is, referring, to, the, twin, monasteries, of, monkwearmouth, and, jarrow, in, modern, day, wearside, and, tyneside, respectively, there, is, also, a, tradition, that, he, was, born, at, monkton, two, miles, from, the, site, where, the, monastery, at, jarrow, was, later, built, bede, says, nothing, of, his, origins, but, his, connections, with, men, of, noble, ancestry, suggest, that, his, own, family, was, well, to, do, bede, s, first, abbot, was, benedict, biscop, and, the, names, biscop, and, beda, both, appear, in, a, list, of, the, kings, of, lindsey, from, around, 800, further, suggesting, that, bede, came, from, a, noble, family, bede, s, name, reflects, west, saxon, b, eda, anglian, b, da, it, is, an, old, english, short, name, formed, on, the, root, of, b, odan, to, bid, command, the, name, also, occurs, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, s, a, 501, as, bieda, one, of, the, sons, of, the, saxon, founder, of, portsmouth, the, liber, vitae, of, durham, cathedral, names, two, priests, with, this, name, one, of, whom, is, presumably, bede, himself, some, manuscripts, of, the, life, of, cuthbert, one, of, bede, s, works, mention, that, cuthbert, s, own, priest, was, named, bede, it, is, possible, that, this, priest, is, the, other, name, listed, in, the, liber, vitae, at, the, age, of, seven, bede, was, sent, as, a, puer, oblatus, to, the, monastery, of, monkwearmouth, by, his, family, to, be, educated, by, benedict, biscop, and, later, by, ceolfrith, bede, does, not, say, whether, it, was, already, intended, at, that, point, that, he, would, be, a, monk, it, was, fairly, common, in, ireland, at, this, time, for, young, boys, particularly, those, of, noble, birth, to, be, fostered, out, as, an, oblate, the, practice, was, also, likely, to, have, been, common, among, the, germanic, peoples, in, england, monkwearmouth, s, sister, monastery, at, jarrow, was, founded, by, ceolfrith, in, 682, and, bede, probably, transferred, to, jarrow, with, ceolfrith, that, year, the, dedication, stone, for, the, church, has, survived, as, of, 1969, it, is, dated, 23, april, 685, and, as, bede, would, have, been, required, to, assist, with, menial, tasks, in, his, day, to, day, life, it, is, possible, that, he, helped, in, building, the, original, church, in, 686, plague, broke, out, at, jarrow, the, life, of, ceolfrith, written, in, about, 710, records, that, only, two, surviving, monks, were, capable, of, singing, the, full, offices, one, was, ceolfrith, and, the, other, a, young, boy, who, according, to, the, anonymous, writer, had, been, taught, by, ceolfrith, the, two, managed, to, do, the, entire, service, of, the, liturgy, until, others, could, be, trained, the, young, boy, was, almost, certainly, bede, who, would, have, been, about, 14, when, bede, was, about, 17, years, old, adomn, n, the, abbot, of, iona, abbey, visited, monkwearmouth, and, jarrow, bede, would, probably, have, met, the, abbot, during, this, visit, and, it, may, be, that, adomn, n, sparked, bede, s, interest, in, the, easter, dating, controversy, in, about, 692, in, bede, s, nineteenth, year, bede, was, ordained, a, deacon, by, his, diocesan, bishop, john, who, was, bishop, of, hexham, the, canonical, age, for, the, ordination, of, a, deacon, was, 25, bede, s, early, ordination, may, mean, that, his, abilities, were, considered, exceptional, but, it, is, also, possible, that, the, minimum, age, requirement, was, often, disregarded, there, might, have, been, minor, orders, ranking, below, a, deacon, but, there, is, no, record, of, whether, bede, held, any, of, these, offices, in, bede, s, thirtieth, year, about, 702, he, became, a, priest, with, the, ordination, again, performed, by, bishop, john, in, about, 701, bede, wrote, his, first, works, the, de, arte, metrica, and, de, schematibus, et, tropis, both, were, intended, for, use, in, the, classroom, he, continued, to, write, for, the, rest, of, his, life, eventually, completing, over, 60, books, most, of, which, have, survived, not, all, his, output, can, be, easily, dated, and, bede, may, have, worked, on, some, texts, over, a, period, of, many, years, his, last, surviving, work, is, a, letter, to, ecgbert, of, york, a, former, student, written, in, 734, a, 6th, century, greek, and, latin, manuscript, of, acts, of, the, apostles, that, is, believed, to, have, been, used, by, bede, survives, and, is, now, in, the, bodleian, library, at, university, of, oxford, it, is, known, as, the, codex, laudianus, bede, may, have, worked, on, some, of, the, latin, bibles, that, were, copied, at, jarrow, one, of, which, the, codex, amiatinus, is, now, held, by, the, laurentian, library, in, florence, bede, was, a, teacher, as, well, as, a, writer, he, enjoyed, music, and, was, said, to, be, accomplished, as, a, singer, and, as, a, reciter, of, poetry, in, the, vernacular, it, is, possible, that, he, suffered, a, speech, impediment, but, this, depends, on, a, phrase, in, the, introduction, to, his, verse, life, of, st, cuthbert, translations, of, this, phrase, differ, and, it, is, uncertain, whether, bede, intended, to, say, that, he, was, cured, of, a, speech, problem, or, merely, that, he, was, inspired, by, the, saint, s, works, in, 708, some, monks, at, hexham, accused, bede, of, having, committed, heresy, in, his, work, de, temporibus, the, standard, theological, view, of, world, history, at, the, time, was, known, as, the, six, ages, of, the, world, in, his, book, bede, calculated, the, age, of, the, world, for, himself, rather, than, accepting, the, authority, of, isidore, of, seville, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, christ, had, been, born, 3, 952, years, after, the, creation, of, the, world, rather, than, the, figure, of, over, 5, 000, years, that, was, commonly, accepted, by, theologians, the, accusation, occurred, in, front, of, the, bishop, of, hexham, wilfrid, who, was, present, at, a, feast, when, some, drunken, monks, made, the, accusation, wilfrid, did, not, respond, to, the, accusation, but, a, monk, present, relayed, the, episode, to, bede, who, replied, within, a, few, days, to, the, monk, writing, a, letter, setting, forth, his, defence, and, asking, that, the, letter, also, be, read, to, wilfrid, bede, had, another, brush, with, wilfrid, for, the, historian, says, that, he, met, wilfrid, sometime, between, 706, and, 709, and, discussed, thelthryth, the, abbess, of, ely, wilfrid, had, been, present, at, the, exhumation, of, her, body, in, 695, and, bede, questioned, the, bishop, about, the, exact, circumstances, of, the, body, and, asked, for, more, details, of, her, life, as, wilfrid, had, been, her, advisor, in, 733, bede, travelled, to, york, to, visit, ecgbert, who, was, then, bishop, of, york, the, see, of, york, was, elevated, to, an, archbishopric, in, 735, and, it, is, likely, that, bede, and, ecgbert, discussed, the, proposal, for, the, elevation, during, his, visit, bede, hoped, to, visit, ecgbert, again, in, 734, but, was, too, ill, to, make, the, journey, bede, also, travelled, to, the, monastery, of, lindisfarne, and, at, some, point, visited, the, otherwise, unknown, monastery, of, a, monk, named, wicthed, a, visit, that, is, mentioned, in, a, letter, to, that, monk, because, of, his, widespread, correspondence, with, others, throughout, the, british, isles, and, because, many, of, the, letters, imply, that, bede, had, met, his, correspondents, it, is, likely, that, bede, travelled, to, some, other, places, although, nothing, further, about, timing, or, locations, can, be, guessed, it, seems, certain, that, he, did, not, visit, rome, however, as, he, did, not, mention, it, in, the, autobiographical, chapter, of, his, historia, ecclesiastica, nothhelm, a, correspondent, of, bede, s, who, assisted, him, by, finding, documents, for, him, in, rome, is, known, to, have, visited, bede, though, the, date, cannot, be, determined, beyond, the, fact, that, it, was, after, nothhelm, s, visit, to, rome, except, for, a, few, visits, to, other, monasteries, his, life, was, spent, in, a, round, of, prayer, observance, of, the, monastic, discipline, and, study, of, the, sacred, scriptures, he, was, considered, the, most, learned, man, of, his, time, bede, died, on, the, feast, of, the, ascension, thursday, 26, may, 735, on, the, floor, of, his, cell, singing, glory, be, to, the, father, and, to, the, son, and, to, the, holy, spirit, and, was, buried, at, jarrow, cuthbert, a, disciple, of, bede, s, wrote, a, letter, to, a, cuthwin, of, whom, nothing, else, is, known, describing, bede, s, last, days, and, his, death, according, to, cuthbert, bede, fell, ill, with, frequent, attacks, of, breathlessness, but, almost, without, pain, before, easter, on, the, tuesday, two, days, before, bede, died, his, breathing, became, worse, and, his, feet, swelled, he, continued, to, dictate, to, a, scribe, however, and, despite, spending, the, night, awake, in, prayer, he, dictated, again, the, following, day, at, three, o, clock, according, to, cuthbert, he, asked, for, a, box, of, his, to, be, brought, and, distributed, among, the, priests, of, the, monastery, a, few, treasures, of, his, some, pepper, and, napkins, and, some, incense, that, night, he, dictated, a, final, sentence, to, the, scribe, a, boy, named, wilberht, and, died, soon, afterwards, the, account, of, cuthbert, does, not, make, entirely, clear, whether, bede, died, before, midnight, or, after, however, by, the, reckoning, of, bede, s, time, passage, from, the, old, day, to, the, new, occurred, at, sunset, not, midnight, and, cuthbert, is, clear, that, he, died, after, sunset, thus, while, his, box, was, brought, at, three, o, clock, wednesday, afternoon, of, 25, may, by, the, time, of, the, final, dictation, it, was, considered, 26, may, although, it, might, still, have, been, 25, may, in, modern, usage, cuthbert, s, letter, also, relates, a, five, line, poem, in, the, vernacular, that, bede, composed, on, his, deathbed, known, as, bede, s, death, song, it, is, the, most, widely, copied, old, english, poem, and, appears, in, 45, manuscripts, but, its, attribution, to, bede, is, not, certain, not, all, manuscripts, name, bede, as, the, author, and, the, ones, that, do, are, of, later, origin, than, those, that, do, not, bede, s, remains, may, have, been, transferred, to, durham, cathedral, in, the, 11th, century, his, tomb, there, was, looted, in, 1541, but, the, contents, were, probably, re, interred, in, the, galilee, chapel, at, the, cathedral, one, further, oddity, in, his, writings, is, that, in, one, of, his, works, the, commentary, on, the, seven, catholic, epistles, he, writes, in, a, manner, that, gives, the, impression, he, was, married, the, section, in, question, is, the, only, one, in, that, work, that, is, written, in, first, person, view, bede, says, prayers, are, hindered, by, the, conjugal, duty, because, as, often, as, i, perform, what, is, due, to, my, wife, i, am, not, able, to, pray, another, passage, in, the, commentary, on, luke, also, mentions, a, wife, in, the, first, person, formerly, i, possessed, a, wife, in, the, lustful, passion, of, desire, and, now, i, possess, her, in, honourable, sanctification, and, true, love, of, christ, the, historian, benedicta, ward, argued, that, these, passages, are, bede, employing, a, rhetorical, device, bede, wrote, scientific, historical, and, theological, works, reflecting, the, range, of, his, writings, from, music, and, metrics, to, exegetical, scripture, commentaries, he, knew, patristic, literature, as, well, as, pliny, the, elder, virgil, lucretius, ovid, horace, and, other, classical, writers, he, knew, some, greek, bede, s, scriptural, commentaries, employed, the, allegorical, method, of, interpretation, and, his, history, includes, accounts, of, miracles, which, to, modern, historians, has, seemed, at, odds, with, his, critical, approach, to, the, materials, in, his, history, modern, studies, have, shown, the, important, role, such, concepts, played, in, the, world, view, of, early, medieval, scholars, although, bede, is, mainly, studied, as, a, historian, now, in, his, time, his, works, on, grammar, chronology, and, biblical, studies, were, as, important, as, his, historical, and, hagiographical, works, the, non, historical, works, contributed, greatly, to, the, carolingian, renaissance, he, has, been, credited, with, writing, a, penitential, though, his, authorship, of, this, work, is, disputed, bede, s, best, known, work, is, the, historia, ecclesiastica, gentis, anglorum, or, an, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, completed, in, about, 731, bede, was, aided, in, writing, this, book, by, albinus, abbot, of, st, augustine, s, abbey, canterbury, the, first, of, the, five, books, begins, with, some, geographical, background, and, then, sketches, the, history, of, england, beginning, with, caesar, s, invasion, in, 55, bc, a, brief, account, of, christianity, in, roman, britain, including, the, martyrdom, of, st, alban, is, followed, by, the, story, of, augustine, s, mission, to, england, in, 597, which, brought, christianity, to, the, anglo, saxons, the, second, book, begins, with, the, death, of, gregory, the, great, in, 604, and, follows, the, further, progress, of, christianity, in, kent, and, the, first, attempts, to, evangelise, northumbria, these, ended, in, disaster, when, penda, the, pagan, king, of, mercia, killed, the, newly, christian, edwin, of, northumbria, at, the, battle, of, hatfield, chase, in, about, 632, the, setback, was, temporary, and, the, third, book, recounts, the, growth, of, christianity, in, northumbria, under, kings, oswald, of, northumbria, and, oswy, the, climax, of, the, third, book, is, the, account, of, the, council, of, whitby, traditionally, seen, as, a, major, turning, point, in, english, history, the, fourth, book, begins, with, the, consecration, of, theodore, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, recounts, wilfrid, s, efforts, to, bring, christianity, to, the, kingdom, of, sussex, the, fifth, book, brings, the, story, up, to, bede, s, day, and, includes, an, account, of, missionary, work, in, frisia, and, of, the, conflict, with, the, british, church, over, the, correct, dating, of, easter, bede, wrote, a, preface, for, the, work, in, which, he, dedicates, it, to, ceolwulf, king, of, northumbria, the, preface, mentions, that, ceolwulf, received, an, earlier, draft, of, the, book, presumably, ceolwulf, knew, enough, latin, to, understand, it, and, he, may, even, have, been, able, to, read, it, the, preface, makes, it, clear, that, ceolwulf, had, requested, the, earlier, copy, and, bede, had, asked, for, ceolwulf, s, approval, this, correspondence, with, the, king, indicates, that, bede, s, monastery, had, connections, among, the, northumbrian, nobility, the, monastery, at, wearmouth, jarrow, had, an, excellent, library, both, benedict, biscop, and, ceolfrith, had, acquired, books, from, the, continent, and, in, bede, s, day, the, monastery, was, a, renowned, centre, of, learning, it, has, been, estimated, that, there, were, about, 200, books, in, the, monastic, library, for, the, period, prior, to, augustine, s, arrival, in, 597, bede, drew, on, earlier, writers, including, solinus, he, had, access, to, two, works, of, eusebius, the, historia, ecclesiastica, and, also, the, chronicon, though, he, had, neither, in, the, original, greek, instead, he, had, a, latin, translation, of, the, historia, by, rufinus, and, jerome, s, translation, of, the, chronicon, he, also, knew, orosius, s, adversus, paganus, and, gregory, of, tours, historia, francorum, both, christian, histories, as, well, as, the, work, of, eutropius, a, pagan, historian, he, used, constantius, s, life, of, germanus, as, a, source, for, germanus, s, visits, to, britain, bede, s, account, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, britain, is, drawn, largely, from, gildas, s, de, excidio, et, conquestu, britanniae, bede, would, also, have, been, familiar, with, more, recent, accounts, such, as, stephen, of, ripon, s, life, of, wilfrid, and, anonymous, life, of, gregory, the, great, and, life, of, cuthbert, he, also, drew, on, josephus, s, antiquities, and, the, works, of, cassiodorus, and, there, was, a, copy, of, the, liber, pontificalis, in, bede, s, monastery, bede, quotes, from, several, classical, authors, including, cicero, plautus, and, terence, but, he, may, have, had, access, to, their, work, via, a, latin, grammar, rather, than, directly, however, it, is, clear, he, was, familiar, with, the, works, of, virgil, and, with, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, and, his, monastery, also, owned, copies, of, the, works, of, dionysius, exiguus, he, probably, drew, his, account, of, alban, from, a, life, of, that, saint, which, has, not, survived, he, acknowledges, two, other, lives, of, saints, directly, one, is, a, life, of, fursa, and, the, other, of, thelburh, the, latter, no, longer, survives, he, also, had, access, to, a, life, of, ceolfrith, some, of, bede, s, material, came, from, oral, traditions, including, a, description, of, the, physical, appearance, of, paulinus, of, york, who, had, died, nearly, 90, years, before, bede, s, historia, ecclesiastica, was, written, bede, had, correspondents, who, supplied, him, with, material, albinus, the, abbot, of, the, monastery, in, canterbury, provided, much, information, about, the, church, in, kent, and, with, the, assistance, of, nothhelm, at, that, time, a, priest, in, london, obtained, copies, of, gregory, the, great, s, correspondence, from, rome, relating, to, augustine, s, mission, almost, all, of, bede, s, information, regarding, augustine, is, taken, from, these, letters, bede, acknowledged, his, correspondents, in, the, preface, to, the, historia, ecclesiastica, he, was, in, contact, with, bishop, daniel, of, winchester, for, information, about, the, history, of, the, church, in, wessex, and, also, wrote, to, the, monastery, at, lastingham, for, information, about, cedd, and, chad, bede, also, mentions, an, abbot, esi, as, a, source, for, the, affairs, of, the, east, anglian, church, and, bishop, cynibert, for, information, about, lindsey, the, historian, walter, goffart, argues, that, bede, based, the, structure, of, the, historia, on, three, works, using, them, as, the, framework, around, which, the, three, main, sections, of, the, work, were, structured, for, the, early, part, of, the, work, up, until, the, gregorian, mission, goffart, feels, that, bede, used, de, excidio, the, second, section, detailing, the, gregorian, mission, of, augustine, of, canterbury, was, framed, on, life, of, gregory, the, great, written, at, whitby, the, last, section, detailing, events, after, the, gregorian, mission, goffart, feels, was, modelled, on, life, of, wilfrid, most, of, bede, s, informants, for, information, after, augustine, s, mission, came, from, the, eastern, part, of, britain, leaving, significant, gaps, in, the, knowledge, of, the, western, areas, which, were, those, areas, likely, to, have, a, native, briton, presence, bede, s, stylistic, models, included, some, of, the, same, authors, from, whom, he, drew, the, material, for, the, earlier, parts, of, his, history, his, introduction, imitates, the, work, of, orosius, and, his, title, is, an, echo, of, eusebius, s, historia, ecclesiastica, bede, also, followed, eusebius, in, taking, the, acts, of, the, apostles, as, the, model, for, the, overall, work, where, eusebius, used, the, acts, as, the, theme, for, his, description, of, the, development, of, the, church, bede, made, it, the, model, for, his, history, of, the, anglo, saxon, church, bede, quoted, his, sources, at, length, in, his, narrative, as, eusebius, had, done, bede, also, appears, to, have, taken, quotes, directly, from, his, correspondents, at, times, for, example, he, almost, always, uses, the, terms, australes, and, occidentales, for, the, south, and, west, saxons, respectively, but, in, a, passage, in, the, first, book, he, uses, meridiani, and, occidui, instead, as, perhaps, his, informant, had, done, at, the, end, of, the, work, bede, adds, a, brief, autobiographical, note, this, was, an, idea, taken, from, gregory, of, tours, earlier, history, of, the, franks, bede, s, work, as, a, hagiographer, and, his, detailed, attention, to, dating, were, both, useful, preparations, for, the, task, of, writing, the, historia, ecclesiastica, his, interest, in, computus, the, science, of, calculating, the, date, of, easter, was, also, useful, in, the, account, he, gives, of, the, controversy, between, the, british, and, anglo, saxon, church, over, the, correct, method, of, obtaining, the, easter, date, bede, is, described, by, michael, lapidge, as, without, question, the, most, accomplished, latinist, produced, in, these, islands, in, the, anglo, saxon, period, his, latin, has, been, praised, for, its, clarity, but, his, style, in, the, historia, ecclesiastica, is, not, simple, he, knew, rhetoric, and, often, used, figures, of, speech, and, rhetorical, forms, which, cannot, easily, be, reproduced, in, translation, depending, as, they, often, do, on, the, connotations, of, the, latin, words, however, unlike, contemporaries, such, as, aldhelm, whose, latin, is, full, of, difficulties, bede, s, own, text, is, easy, to, read, in, the, words, of, charles, plummer, one, of, the, best, known, editors, of, the, historia, ecclesiastica, bede, s, latin, is, clear, and, limpid, it, is, very, seldom, that, we, have, to, pause, to, think, of, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, alcuin, rightly, praises, bede, for, his, unpretending, style, bede, s, primary, intention, in, writing, the, historia, ecclesiastica, was, to, show, the, growth, of, the, united, church, throughout, england, the, native, britons, whose, christian, church, survived, the, departure, of, the, romans, earn, bede, s, ire, for, refusing, to, help, convert, the, anglo, saxons, by, the, end, of, the, historia, the, english, and, their, church, are, dominant, over, the, britons, this, goal, of, showing, the, movement, towards, unity, explains, bede, s, animosity, towards, the, british, method, of, calculating, easter, much, of, the, historia, is, devoted, to, a, history, of, the, dispute, including, the, final, resolution, at, the, synod, of, whitby, in, 664, bede, is, also, concerned, to, show, the, unity, of, the, english, despite, the, disparate, kingdoms, that, still, existed, when, he, was, writing, he, also, wants, to, instruct, the, reader, by, spiritual, example, and, to, entertain, and, to, the, latter, end, he, adds, stories, about, many, of, the, places, and, people, about, which, he, wrote, n, j, higham, argues, that, bede, designed, his, work, to, promote, his, reform, agenda, to, ceolwulf, the, northumbrian, king, bede, painted, a, highly, optimistic, picture, of, the, current, situation, in, the, church, as, opposed, to, the, more, pessimistic, picture, found, in, his, private, letters, bede, s, extensive, use, of, miracles, can, prove, difficult, for, readers, who, consider, him, a, more, or, less, reliable, historian, but, do, not, accept, the, possibility, of, miracles, yet, both, reflect, an, inseparable, integrity, and, regard, for, accuracy, and, truth, expressed, in, terms, both, of, historical, events, and, of, a, tradition, of, christian, faith, that, continues, bede, like, gregory, the, great, whom, bede, quotes, on, the, subject, in, the, historia, felt, that, faith, brought, about, by, miracles, was, a, stepping, stone, to, a, higher, truer, faith, and, that, as, a, result, miracles, had, their, place, in, a, work, designed, to, instruct, bede, is, somewhat, reticent, about, the, career, of, wilfrid, a, contemporary, and, one, of, the, most, prominent, clerics, of, his, day, this, may, be, because, wilfrid, s, opulent, lifestyle, was, uncongenial, to, bede, s, monastic, mind, it, may, also, be, that, the, events, of, wilfrid, s, life, divisive, and, controversial, as, they, were, simply, did, not, fit, with, bede, s, theme, of, the, progression, to, a, unified, and, harmonious, church, bede, s, account, of, the, early, migrations, of, the, angles, and, saxons, to, england, omits, any, mention, of, a, movement, of, those, peoples, across, the, english, channel, from, britain, to, brittany, described, by, procopius, who, was, writing, in, the, sixth, century, frank, stenton, describes, this, omission, as, a, scholar, s, dislike, of, the, indefinite, traditional, material, that, could, not, be, dated, or, used, for, bede, s, didactic, purposes, had, no, interest, for, him, bede, was, a, northumbrian, and, this, tinged, his, work, with, a, local, bias, the, sources, to, which, he, had, access, gave, him, less, information, about, the, west, of, england, than, for, other, areas, he, says, relatively, little, about, the, achievements, of, mercia, and, wessex, omitting, for, example, any, mention, of, boniface, a, west, saxon, missionary, to, the, continent, of, some, renown, and, of, whom, bede, had, almost, certainly, heard, though, bede, does, discuss, northumbrian, missionaries, to, the, continent, he, is, also, parsimonious, in, his, praise, for, aldhelm, a, west, saxon, who, had, done, much, to, convert, the, native, britons, to, the, roman, form, of, christianity, he, lists, seven, kings, of, the, anglo, saxons, whom, he, regards, as, having, held, imperium, or, overlordship, only, one, king, of, wessex, ceawlin, is, listed, as, bretwalda, and, none, from, mercia, though, elsewhere, he, acknowledges, the, secular, power, several, of, the, mercians, held, historian, robin, fleming, states, that, he, was, so, hostile, to, mercia, because, northumbria, had, been, diminished, by, mercian, power, that, he, consulted, no, mercian, informants, and, included, no, stories, about, its, saints, bede, relates, the, story, of, augustine, s, mission, from, rome, and, tells, how, the, british, clergy, refused, to, assist, augustine, in, the, conversion, of, the, anglo, saxons, this, combined, with, gildas, s, negative, assessment, of, the, british, church, at, the, time, of, the, anglo, saxon, invasions, led, bede, to, a, very, critical, view, of, the, native, church, however, bede, ignores, the, fact, that, at, the, time, of, augustine, s, mission, the, history, between, the, two, was, one, of, warfare, and, conquest, which, in, the, words, of, barbara, yorke, would, have, naturally, curbed, any, missionary, impulses, towards, the, anglo, saxons, from, the, british, clergy, at, the, time, bede, wrote, the, historia, ecclesiastica, there, were, two, common, ways, of, referring, to, dates, one, was, to, use, indictions, which, were, 15, year, cycles, counting, from, 312, ad, there, were, three, different, varieties, of, indiction, each, starting, on, a, different, day, of, the, year, the, other, approach, was, to, use, regnal, years, the, reigning, roman, emperor, for, example, or, the, ruler, of, whichever, kingdom, was, under, discussion, this, meant, that, in, discussing, conflicts, between, kingdoms, the, date, would, have, to, be, given, in, the, regnal, years, of, all, the, kings, involved, bede, used, both, these, approaches, on, occasion, but, adopted, a, third, method, as, his, main, approach, to, dating, the, anno, domini, method, invented, by, dionysius, exiguus, although, bede, did, not, invent, this, method, his, adoption, of, it, and, his, promulgation, of, it, in, de, temporum, ratione, his, work, on, chronology, is, the, main, reason, it, is, now, so, widely, used, bede, s, easter, table, contained, in, de, temporum, ratione, was, developed, from, dionysius, exiguus, easter, table, the, historia, ecclesiastica, was, copied, often, in, the, middle, ages, and, about, 160, manuscripts, containing, it, survive, about, half, of, those, are, located, on, the, european, continent, rather, than, in, the, british, isles, most, of, the, 8th, and, 9th, century, texts, of, bede, s, historia, come, from, the, northern, parts, of, the, carolingian, empire, this, total, does, not, include, manuscripts, with, only, a, part, of, the, work, of, which, another, 100, or, so, survive, it, was, printed, for, the, first, time, between, 1474, and, 1482, probably, at, strasbourg, modern, historians, have, studied, the, historia, extensively, and, several, editions, have, been, produced, for, many, years, early, anglo, saxon, history, was, essentially, a, retelling, of, the, historia, but, recent, scholarship, has, focused, as, much, on, what, bede, did, not, write, as, what, he, did, the, belief, that, the, historia, was, the, culmination, of, bede, s, works, the, aim, of, all, his, scholarship, was, a, belief, common, among, historians, in, the, past, but, is, no, longer, accepted, by, most, scholars, modern, historians, and, editors, of, bede, have, been, lavish, in, their, praise, of, his, achievement, in, the, historia, ecclesiastica, stenton, regards, it, as, one, of, the, small, class, of, books, which, transcend, all, but, the, most, fundamental, conditions, of, time, and, place, and, regards, its, quality, as, dependent, on, bede, s, astonishing, power, of, co, ordinating, the, fragments, of, information, which, came, to, him, through, tradition, the, relation, of, friends, or, documentary, evidence, in, an, age, where, little, was, attempted, beyond, the, registration, of, fact, he, had, reached, the, conception, of, history, patrick, wormald, describes, him, as, the, first, and, greatest, of, england, s, historians, the, historia, ecclesiastica, has, given, bede, a, high, reputation, but, his, concerns, were, different, from, those, of, a, modern, writer, of, history, his, focus, on, the, history, of, the, organisation, of, the, english, church, and, on, heresies, and, the, efforts, made, to, root, them, out, led, him, to, exclude, the, secular, history, of, kings, and, kingdoms, except, where, a, moral, lesson, could, be, drawn, or, where, they, illuminated, events, in, the, church, besides, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, the, medieval, writers, william, of, malmesbury, henry, of, huntingdon, and, geoffrey, of, monmouth, used, his, works, as, sources, and, inspirations, early, modern, writers, such, as, polydore, vergil, and, matthew, parker, the, elizabethan, archbishop, of, canterbury, also, utilised, the, historia, and, his, works, were, used, by, both, protestant, and, catholic, sides, in, the, wars, of, religion, some, historians, have, questioned, the, reliability, of, some, of, bede, s, accounts, one, historian, charlotte, behr, thinks, that, the, historia, s, account, of, the, arrival, of, the, germanic, invaders, in, kent, should, not, be, considered, to, relate, what, actually, happened, but, rather, relates, myths, that, were, current, in, kent, during, bede, s, time, it, is, likely, that, bede, s, work, because, it, was, so, widely, copied, discouraged, others, from, writing, histories, and, may, even, have, led, to, the, disappearance, of, manuscripts, containing, older, historical, works, as, chapter, 66, of, his, on, the, reckoning, of, time, in, 725, bede, wrote, the, greater, chronicle, chronica, maiora, which, sometimes, circulated, as, a, separate, work, for, recent, events, the, chronicle, like, his, ecclesiastical, history, relied, upon, gildas, upon, a, version, of, the, liber, pontificalis, current, at, least, to, the, papacy, of, pope, sergius, i, 687, 701, and, other, sources, for, earlier, events, he, drew, on, eusebius, s, chronikoi, kanones, the, dating, of, events, in, the, chronicle, is, inconsistent, with, his, other, works, using, the, era, of, creation, the, anno, mundi, his, other, historical, works, included, lives, of, the, abbots, of, wearmouth, and, jarrow, as, well, as, verse, and, prose, lives, of, st, cuthbert, an, adaptation, of, paulinus, of, nola, s, life, of, st, felix, and, a, translation, of, the, greek, passion, of, st, anastasius, he, also, created, a, listing, of, saints, the, martyrology, in, his, own, time, bede, was, as, well, known, for, his, biblical, commentaries, and, for, his, exegetical, and, other, theological, works, the, majority, of, his, writings, were, of, this, type, and, covered, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, most, survived, the, middle, ages, but, a, few, were, lost, it, was, for, his, theological, writings, that, he, earned, the, title, of, doctor, anglorum, and, why, he, was, declared, a, saint, bede, synthesised, and, transmitted, the, learning, from, his, predecessors, as, well, as, made, careful, judicious, innovation, in, knowledge, such, as, recalculating, the, age, of, the, earth, for, which, he, was, censured, before, surviving, the, heresy, accusations, and, eventually, having, his, views, championed, by, archbishop, ussher, in, the, sixteenth, century, see, below, that, had, theological, implications, in, order, to, do, this, he, learned, greek, and, attempted, to, learn, hebrew, he, spent, time, reading, and, rereading, both, the, old, and, the, new, testaments, he, mentions, that, he, studied, from, a, text, of, jerome, s, vulgate, which, itself, was, from, the, hebrew, text, he, also, studied, both, the, latin, and, the, greek, fathers, of, the, church, in, the, monastic, library, at, jarrow, were, numerous, books, by, theologians, including, works, by, basil, cassian, john, chrysostom, isidore, of, seville, origen, gregory, of, nazianzus, augustine, of, hippo, jerome, pope, gregory, i, ambrose, of, milan, cassiodorus, and, cyprian, he, used, these, in, conjunction, with, the, biblical, texts, themselves, to, write, his, commentaries, and, other, theological, works, he, had, a, latin, translation, by, evagrius, of, athanasius, s, life, of, antony, and, a, copy, of, sulpicius, severus, life, of, st, martin, he, also, used, lesser, known, writers, such, as, fulgentius, julian, of, eclanum, tyconius, and, prosper, of, aquitaine, bede, was, the, first, to, refer, to, jerome, augustine, pope, gregory, and, ambrose, as, the, four, latin, fathers, of, the, church, it, is, clear, from, bede, s, own, comments, that, he, felt, his, calling, was, to, explain, to, his, students, and, readers, the, theology, and, thoughts, of, the, church, fathers, bede, also, wrote, homilies, works, written, to, explain, theology, used, in, worship, services, he, wrote, homilies, on, the, major, christian, seasons, such, as, advent, lent, or, easter, as, well, as, on, other, subjects, such, as, anniversaries, of, significant, events, both, types, of, bede, s, theological, works, circulated, widely, in, the, middle, ages, several, of, his, biblical, commentaries, were, incorporated, into, the, glossa, ordinaria, an, 11th, century, collection, of, biblical, commentaries, some, of, bede, s, homilies, were, collected, by, paul, the, deacon, and, they, were, used, in, that, form, in, the, monastic, office, boniface, used, bede, s, homilies, in, his, missionary, efforts, on, the, continent, bede, sometimes, included, in, his, theological, books, an, acknowledgement, of, the, predecessors, on, whose, works, he, drew, in, two, cases, he, left, instructions, that, his, marginal, notes, which, gave, the, details, of, his, sources, should, be, preserved, by, the, copyist, and, he, may, have, originally, added, marginal, comments, about, his, sources, to, others, of, his, works, where, he, does, not, specify, it, is, still, possible, to, identify, books, to, which, he, must, have, had, access, by, quotations, that, he, uses, a, full, catalogue, of, the, library, available, to, bede, in, the, monastery, cannot, be, reconstructed, but, it, is, possible, to, tell, for, example, that, bede, was, very, familiar, with, the, works, of, virgil, there, is, little, evidence, that, he, had, access, to, any, other, of, the, pagan, latin, writers, he, quotes, many, of, these, writers, but, the, quotes, are, almost, always, found, in, the, latin, grammars, that, were, common, in, his, day, one, or, more, of, which, would, certainly, have, been, at, the, monastery, another, difficulty, is, that, manuscripts, of, early, writers, were, often, incomplete, it, is, apparent, that, bede, had, access, to, pliny, s, encyclopaedia, for, example, but, it, seems, that, the, version, he, had, was, missing, book, xviii, since, he, did, not, quote, from, it, in, his, de, temporum, ratione, bede, s, works, included, commentary, on, revelation, commentary, on, the, catholic, epistles, commentary, on, acts, reconsideration, on, the, books, of, acts, on, the, gospel, of, mark, on, the, gospel, of, luke, and, homilies, on, the, gospels, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, working, on, a, translation, of, the, gospel, of, john, into, english, he, did, this, for, the, last, 40, days, of, his, life, when, the, last, passage, had, been, translated, he, said, all, is, finished, the, works, dealing, with, the, old, testament, included, commentary, on, samuel, commentary, on, genesis, commentaries, on, ezra, and, nehemiah, on, the, temple, on, the, tabernacle, commentaries, on, tobit, commentaries, on, proverbs, commentaries, on, the, song, of, songs, commentaries, on, the, canticle, of, habakkuk, the, works, on, ezra, the, tabernacle, and, the, temple, were, especially, influenced, by, gregory, the, great, s, writings, de, temporibus, or, on, time, written, in, about, 703, provides, an, introduction, to, the, principles, of, easter, computus, this, was, based, on, parts, of, isidore, of, seville, s, etymologies, and, bede, also, included, a, chronology, of, the, world, which, was, derived, from, eusebius, with, some, revisions, based, on, jerome, s, translation, of, the, bible, in, about, 723, bede, wrote, a, longer, work, on, the, same, subject, on, the, reckoning, of, time, which, was, influential, throughout, the, middle, ages, he, also, wrote, several, shorter, letters, and, essays, discussing, specific, aspects, of, computus, on, the, reckoning, of, time, de, temporum, ratione, included, an, introduction, to, the, traditional, ancient, and, medieval, view, of, the, cosmos, including, an, explanation, of, how, the, spherical, earth, influenced, the, changing, length, of, daylight, of, how, the, seasonal, motion, of, the, sun, and, moon, influenced, the, changing, appearance, of, the, new, moon, at, evening, twilight, bede, also, records, the, effect, of, the, moon, on, tides, he, shows, that, the, twice, daily, timing, of, tides, is, related, to, the, moon, and, that, the, lunar, monthly, cycle, of, spring, and, neap, tides, is, also, related, to, the, moon, s, position, he, goes, on, to, note, that, the, times, of, tides, vary, along, the, same, coast, and, that, the, water, movements, cause, low, tide, at, one, place, when, there, is, high, tide, elsewhere, since, the, focus, of, his, book, was, the, computus, bede, gave, instructions, for, computing, the, date, of, easter, from, the, date, of, the, paschal, full, moon, for, calculating, the, motion, of, the, sun, and, moon, through, the, zodiac, and, for, many, other, calculations, related, to, the, calendar, he, gives, some, information, about, the, months, of, the, anglo, saxon, calendar, any, codex, of, bede, s, easter, table, is, normally, found, together, with, a, codex, of, his, de, temporum, ratione, his, easter, table, being, an, exact, extension, of, dionysius, exiguus, paschal, table, and, covering, the, time, interval, ad, 532, 1063, contains, a, 532, year, paschal, cycle, based, on, the, so, called, classical, alexandrian, 19, year, lunar, cycle, being, the, close, variant, of, bishop, theophilus, 19, year, lunar, cycle, proposed, by, annianus, and, adopted, by, bishop, cyril, of, alexandria, around, ad, 425, the, ultimate, similar, but, rather, different, predecessor, of, this, metonic, 19, year, lunar, cycle, is, the, one, invented, by, anatolius, around, ad, 260, for, calendric, purposes, bede, made, a, new, calculation, of, the, age, of, the, world, since, the, creation, which, he, dated, as, 3952, bc, because, of, his, innovations, in, computing, the, age, of, the, world, he, was, accused, of, heresy, at, the, table, of, bishop, wilfrid, his, chronology, being, contrary, to, accepted, calculations, once, informed, of, the, accusations, of, these, lewd, rustics, bede, refuted, them, in, his, letter, to, plegwin, in, addition, to, these, works, on, astronomical, timekeeping, he, also, wrote, de, natura, rerum, or, on, the, nature, of, things, modelled, in, part, after, the, work, of, the, same, title, by, isidore, of, seville, his, works, were, so, influential, that, late, in, the, ninth, century, notker, the, stammerer, a, monk, of, the, monastery, of, st, gall, in, switzerland, wrote, that, god, the, orderer, of, natures, who, raised, the, sun, from, the, east, on, the, fourth, day, of, creation, in, the, sixth, day, of, the, world, has, made, bede, rise, from, the, west, as, a, new, sun, to, illuminate, the, whole, earth, bede, wrote, some, works, designed, to, help, teach, grammar, in, the, abbey, school, one, of, these, was, de, arte, metrica, a, discussion, of, the, composition, of, latin, verse, drawing, on, previous, grammarians, work, it, was, based, on, donatus, s, de, pedibus, and, servius, s, de, finalibus, and, used, examples, from, christian, poets, as, well, as, virgil, it, became, a, standard, text, for, the, teaching, of, latin, verse, during, the, next, few, centuries, bede, dedicated, this, work, to, cuthbert, apparently, a, student, for, he, is, named, beloved, son, in, the, dedication, and, bede, says, i, have, laboured, to, educate, you, in, divine, letters, and, ecclesiastical, statutes, de, orthographia, is, a, work, on, orthography, designed, to, help, a, medieval, reader, of, latin, with, unfamiliar, abbreviations, and, words, from, classical, latin, works, although, it, could, serve, as, a, textbook, it, appears, to, have, been, mainly, intended, as, a, reference, work, the, date, of, composition, for, both, of, these, works, is, unknown, de, schematibus, et, tropis, sacrae, scripturae, discusses, the, bible, s, use, of, rhetoric, bede, was, familiar, with, pagan, authors, such, as, virgil, but, it, was, not, considered, appropriate, to, teach, biblical, grammar, from, such, texts, and, bede, argues, for, the, superiority, of, christian, texts, in, understanding, christian, literature, similarly, his, text, on, poetic, metre, uses, only, christian, poetry, for, examples, a, number, of, poems, have, been, attributed, to, bede, his, poetic, output, has, been, systematically, surveyed, and, edited, by, michael, lapidge, who, concluded, that, the, following, works, belong, to, bede, the, versus, de, die, iudicii, verses, on, the, day, of, judgement, found, complete, in, 33, manuscripts, and, fragmentarily, in, 10, the, metrical, vita, sancti, cudbercti, life, of, st, cuthbert, and, two, collections, of, verse, mentioned, in, the, historia, ecclesiastica, v, 24, 2, bede, names, the, first, of, these, collections, as, librum, epigrammatum, heroico, metro, siue, elegiaco, a, book, of, epigrams, in, the, heroic, or, elegiac, metre, and, much, of, its, content, has, been, reconstructed, by, lapidge, from, scattered, attestations, under, the, title, liber, epigrammatum, the, second, is, named, as, liber, hymnorum, diuerso, metro, siue, rythmo, a, book, of, hymns, diverse, in, metre, or, rhythm, this, has, been, reconstructed, by, lapidge, as, containing, ten, liturgical, hymns, one, paraliturgical, hymn, for, the, feast, of, st, thelthryth, and, four, other, hymn, like, compositions, according, to, his, disciple, cuthbert, bede, was, doctus, in, nostris, carminibus, learned, in, our, songs, cuthbert, s, letter, on, bede, s, death, the, epistola, cuthberti, de, obitu, bedae, moreover, commonly, is, understood, to, indicate, that, bede, composed, a, five, line, vernacular, poem, known, to, modern, scholars, as, bede, s, death, song, and, he, used, to, repeat, that, sentence, from, st, paul, it, is, a, fearful, thing, to, fall, into, the, hands, of, the, living, god, and, many, other, verses, of, scripture, urging, us, thereby, to, awake, from, the, slumber, of, the, soul, by, thinking, in, good, time, of, our, last, hour, and, in, our, own, language, for, he, was, familiar, with, english,

to, bede, most, manuscripts, of, the, latter, do, not, use, a, finite, verb, to, describe, bede, s, presentation, of, the, song, and, the, theme, was, relatively, common, in, old, english, and, anglo, latin, literature, the, fact, that, cuthbert, s, description, places, the, performance, of, the, old, english, poem, in, the, context, of, a, series, of, quoted, passages, from, sacred, scripture, might, be, taken, as, evidence, simply, that, bede, also, cited, analogous, vernacular, texts, on, the, other, hand, the, inclusion, of, the, old, english, text, of, the, poem, in, cuthbert, s, latin, letter, the, observation, that, bede, was, learned, in, our, song, and, the, fact, that, bede, composed, a, latin, poem, on, the, same, subject, all, point, to, the, possibility, of, his, having, written, it, by, citing, the, poem, directly, cuthbert, seems, to, imply, that, its, particular, wording, was, somehow, important, either, since, it, was, a, vernacular, poem, endorsed, by, a, scholar, who, evidently, frowned, upon, secular, entertainment, or, because, it, is, a, direct, quotation, of, bede, s, last, original, composition, there, is, no, evidence, for, cult, being, paid, to, bede, in, england, in, the, 8th, century, one, reason, for, this, may, be, that, he, died, on, the, feast, day, of, augustine, of, canterbury, later, when, he, was, venerated, in, england, he, was, either, commemorated, after, augustine, on, 26, may, or, his, feast, was, moved, to, 27, may, however, he, was, venerated, outside, england, mainly, through, the, efforts, of, boniface, and, alcuin, both, of, whom, promoted, the, cult, on, the, continent, boniface, wrote, repeatedly, back, to, england, during, his, missionary, efforts, requesting, copies, of, bede, s, theological, works, alcuin, who, was, taught, at, the, school, set, up, in, york, by, bede, s, pupil, ecgbert, praised, bede, as, an, example, for, monks, to, follow, and, was, instrumental, in, disseminating, bede, s, works, to, all, of, alcuin, s, friends, bede, s, cult, became, prominent, in, england, during, the, 10th, century, revival, of, monasticism, and, by, the, 14th, century, had, spread, to, many, of, the, cathedrals, of, england, wulfstan, bishop, of, worcester, was, a, particular, devotee, of, bede, s, dedicating, a, church, to, him, in, 1062, which, was, wulfstan, s, first, undertaking, after, his, consecration, as, bishop, his, body, was, translated, the, ecclesiastical, term, for, relocation, of, relics, from, jarrow, to, durham, cathedral, around, 1020, where, it, was, placed, in, the, same, tomb, with, st, cuthbert, later, bede, s, remains, were, moved, to, a, shrine, in, the, galilee, chapel, at, durham, cathedral, in, 1370, the, shrine, was, destroyed, during, the, english, reformation, but, the, bones, were, reburied, in, the, chapel, in, 1831, the, bones, were, dug, up, and, then, reburied, in, a, new, tomb, which, is, still, there, other, relics, were, claimed, by, york, glastonbury, and, fulda, his, scholarship, and, importance, to, catholicism, were, recognised, in, 1899, when, the, vatican, declared, him, a, doctor, of, the, church, he, is, the, only,

than, on, his, date, of, death, 26, may, which, was, then, the, feast, day, of, st, augustine, of, canterbury, he, is, venerated, in, the, catholic, church, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, united, states, on, 25, may, and, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, with, a, feast, day, on, 27, may, bede, became, known, as, venerable, bede, latin, beda, venerabilis, by, the, 9th, century, because, of, his, holiness, but, this, was, not, linked, to, consideration, for, sainthood, by, the, catholic, church, according, to, a, legend, the, epithet, was, miraculously, supplied, by, angels, thus, completing, his, unfinished, epitaph, it, is, first, utilised, in, connection, with, bede, in, the, 9th, century, where, bede, was, grouped, with, others, who, were, called, venerable, at, two, ecclesiastical, councils, held, at, aachen, in, 816, and, 836, paul, the, deacon, then, referred, to, him, as, venerable, consistently, by, the, 11th, and, 12th, century,
