earning, hawthorne, 1, 500, over, 14, years, the, book, became, a, best, seller, in, the, united, states, and, initiated, his, most, lucrative, period, as, a, writer, hawthorne, s, friend, edwin, percy, whipple, objected, to, the, novel, s, morbid, intensity, and, its, dense, psychological, details, writing, that, the, book, is, therefore, apt, to, become, like, hawthorne, too, painfully, anatomical, in, his, exhibition, of, them, while, 20th, century, writer, d, h, lawrence, said, that, there, could, be, no, more, perfect, work, of, the, american, imagination, than, the, scarlet,

review, of, the, collection, was, printed, in, the, literary, world, on, august, 17, and, august, 24, titled, hawthorne, and, his, mosses, melville, wrote, that, these, stories, revealed, a, dark, side, to, hawthorne, shrouded, in, blackness, ten, times, black, he, was, composing, his, novel, moby, dick, at, the, time, and, dedicated, the, work, in, 1851, to, hawthorne, in, token, of, my, admiration, for, his, genius, this, book, is, inscribed, to, nathaniel, hawthorne, hawthorne, s, time, in, the, berkshires, was, very, productive, while, there, he, wrote, the, house, of, the, seven, gables, 1851, which, poet, and, critic, james, russell, lowell, said, was, better, than, the, scarlet, letter, and, called, the, most, valuable, contribution, to, new, england, history, that, has, been, made, he, also, wrote, the, blithedale, romance, 1852, his, only, work, written, in, the, first, person, he, also, published, a, wonder, book, for, girls, and, boys, in, 1851, a, collection, of,

included, emerson, and, henry, david, thoreau, that, year, hawthorne, wrote, the, life, of, franklin, pierce, the, campaign, biography, of, his, friend, which, depicted, him, as, a, man, of, peaceful, pursuits, horace, mann, said, if, he, makes, out, pierce, to, be, a, great, man, or, a, brave, man, it, will, be, the, greatest, work, of, fiction, he, ever, wrote, in, the, biography, hawthorne, depicts, pierce, as, a, statesman, and, soldier, who, had, accomplished, no, great, feats, because, of, his, need, to, make, little, noise, and, so, withdrew, into, the, background, he, also, left, out, pierce, s, drinking, habits, despite, rumors, of, his, alcoholism, and, emphasized, pierce, s, belief, that, slavery, could, not, be, remedied, by, human, contrivances, but, would, over, time, vanish, like, a, dream, with, pierce, s, election, as, president, hawthorne, was, rewarded, in, 1853, with, the, position, of, united, states, consul, in, liverpool, shortly, after, the, publication, of, tanglewood, tales, the, role, was, considered, the, most, lucrative, foreign, service, position, at, the, time, described, by, hawthorne, s, wife, as, second, in, dignity, to, the, embassy, in, london, during, this, period, he, and, his, family, lived, in, the, rock, park, estate, in, rock, ferry, in, one, of, the, houses, directly, adjacent, to, tranmere, beach, on, the, wirral, shore, of, the, river, mersey, thus, to, attend, his, place, of, employment, at, the, united, states, consulate, in, liverpool, hawthorne, would, have, been, a, regular, passenger, on, the, steamboat, operated, rock, ferry, to, liverpool, ferry, service, departing, from, the, rock, ferry, slipway, at, the, end, of, bedford, road, his, appointment, ended, in, 1857, at, the, close, of, the, pierce, administration, the, hawthorne, family, toured, france, and, italy, until, 1860, during, his, time, in, italy, the, previously, clean, shaven, hawthorne, grew, a, bushy, mustache, the, family, returned, to, the, wayside, in, 1860, and, that, year, saw, the, publication, of, the, marble, faun, his, first, new, book, in, seven, years, hawthorne, admitted, that, he, had, aged, considerably, referring, to, himself, as, wrinkled, with, time, and, trouble, at, the, outset, of, the, american, civil, war, hawthorne, traveled, with, william, d, ticknor, to, washington, d, c, where, he, met, abraham, lincoln, and, other, notable, figures, he, wrote, about, his, experiences, in, the, essay, chiefly, about, war, matters, in, 1862, failing, health, prevented, him, from, completing, several, more, romance, novels, hawthorne, was, suffering, from, pain, in, his, stomach, and, insisted, on, a, recuperative, trip, with, his, friend, franklin, pierce, though, his, neighbor, bronson, alcott,

emerson, wrote, of, the, funeral, i, thought, there, was, a, tragic, element, in, the, event, that, might, be, more, fully, rendered, in, the, painful, solitude, of, the, man, which, i, suppose, could, no, longer, be, endured, he, died, of, it, his, wife, sophia, and, daughter, una, were, originally, buried, in, england, however, in, june, 2006, they, were, reinterred, in, plots, adjacent, to, hawthorne, hawthorne, had, a, particularly, close, relationship, with, his, publishers, william, ticknor, and, james, t, fields, hawthorne, once, told, fields, i, care, more, for, your, good, opinion, than, for, that, of, a, host, of, critics, in, fact, it, was, fields, who, convinced, hawthorne, to, turn, the, scarlet, letter, into, a, novel, rather, than, a, short, story, ticknor, handled, many, of, hawthorne, s, personal, matters, including, the, purchase, of, cigars, overseeing, financial, accounts, and, even, purchasing, clothes, ticknor, died, with, hawthorne, at, his, side, in, philadelphia, in, 1864, according, to, a, friend, hawthorne, was, left, apparently, dazed, hawthorne, s, works, belong, to, romanticism, or, more, specifically, dark, romanticism, cautionary, tales, that, suggest, that, guilt, sin, and, evil, are, the, most, inherent, natural, qualities, of, humanity, many, of, his, works, are, inspired, by, puritan, new, england, combining, historical, romance, loaded, with, symbolism, and, deep, psychological, themes, bordering, on, surrealism, his, depictions, of, the, past, are, a, version, of, historical, fiction, used, only, as, a, vehicle, to, express, common, themes, of, ancestral, sin, guilt, and, retribution, his, later, writings, also, reflect, his, negative, view, of, the, transcendentalism, movement, hawthorne, was, predominantly, a, short, story, writer, in, his, early, career, upon, publishing, twice, told, tales, however, he, noted, i, do, not, think, much, of, them, and, he, expected, little, response, from, the, public, his, four, major, romances, were, written, between, 1850, and, 1860, the, scarlet, letter, 1850, the, house, of, the, seven, gables, 1851, the, blithedale, romance, 1852, and, the, marble, faun, 1860, another, novel, length, romance, fanshawe, was, published, anonymously, in, 1828, hawthorne, defined, a, romance, as, being, radically, different, from, a, novel, by, not, being, concerned, with, the, possible, or, probable, course, of, ordinary, experience, in, the, preface, to, the, house, of, the, seven, gables, hawthorne, describes, his, romance, writing, as, using, atmospherical, medium, as, to, bring, out, or, mellow, the, lights, and, deepen, and, enrich, the, shadows, of, the, picture, the, picture, daniel, hoffman, found, was, one, of, the, primitive, energies, of, fecundity, and, creation, critics, have, applied, feminist, perspectives, and, historicist, approaches, to, hawthorne, s, depictions, of, women, feminist, scholars, are, interested, particularly, in, hester, prynne, they, recognize, that, while, she, herself, could, not, be, the, destined, prophetess, of, the, future, the, angel, and, apostle, of, the, coming, revelation, must,
