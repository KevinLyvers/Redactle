having, lost, one, and, then, both, eyes, jan, i, ka, led, hussite, forces, against, three, crusades, and, never, lost, a, single, battle, although, he, was, completely, blind, in, his, last, stages, of, life, he, was, born, in, the, small, village, of, trocnov, in, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, into, a, family, from, the, czech, nobility, according, to, piccolomini, s, historia, bohemica, he, had,

where, he, defended, radzy, against, the, teutonic, order, later, he, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, civil, wars, in, bohemia, he, led, the, hussites, during, the, first, important, clashes, of, the, conflict, in, the, battle, of, sudom, 1420, and, in, the, battle, of, v, tkov, hill, 1420, in, the, battle, of, kutn, hora, 1421, he, defeated, the, army, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, hungarian, kingdom, the, effectiveness, of, his, field, artillery, against, the, royal, cavalry, in, this, battle, made, it, a, successful, element, of, hussite, armies, i, ka, s, tactics, were, unorthodox, and, innovative, in, addition, to, training, and, equipping, his, army, according, to, their, abilities, he, used, armored, wagons, fitted, with, small, cannons, and, muskets, anticipating, the, tank, of, five, hundred, years, later, he, exploited, geographic, features, to, the, full, and, maintained, good, discipline, in, his, armies, he, had, to, train, peasants, quickly, to, face, highly, trained, and, armored, opponents, repeatedly, who, usually, outnumbered, his, own, troops, for, those, reasons, he, is, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, military, commanders, of, all, time, a, monument, was, erected, on, the, v, tkov, hill, in, prague, to, honor, jan, i, ka, and, his, victory, on, this, hill, in, 1420, it, is, the, third, largest, bronze, equestrian, statue, in, the, world, jan, i, ka, was, born, in, one, of, two, meierhofs, of, the, village, trocnov, nowadays, part, of, borovany, an, old, legend, says, that, he, was, born, in, the, forest, under, an, oak, growing, just, next, to, the, fields, and, little, ponds, belonging, to, the, meierhof, i, ka, s, family, belonged, to, the, lower, czech, gentry, zeman, but, did, not, own, much, estate, little, is, known, of, the, rest, of, the, family, jan, i, ka, had, several, siblings, but, the, only, names, known, to, historians, are, brother, jaroslav, and, sister, ane, ka, the, family, had, a, crayfish, in, their, coat, of, arms, the, date, of, i, ka, s, birth, is, not, known, a, document, dated, 3, april, 1378, mentions, johannes, dictus, zizka, de, trocnov, jan, called, zizka, of, trocnov, as, a, witness, on, a, marriage, contract, on, the, basis, of, this, document, it, is, assumed, that, i, ka, must, have, been, of, legal, age, at, this, time, and, was, born, around, 1360, nevertheless, there, is, no, direct, evidence, whether, jan, i, ka, listed, on, this, document, was, identical, with, the, hussite, general, for, example, czech, historian, tomek, and, his, followers, supposed, it, could, have, been, the, military, leader, s, father, they, argued, that, if, i, ka, were, adult, in, 1378, he, would, be, too, old, to, become, such, an, able, commander, after, 1419, others, such, as, mahel, admitted, that, even, such, an, age, might, not, have, prevented, him, from, successful, leadership, furthermore, historian, petr, ornej, notes, that, i, ka, was, not, a, family, name, but, a, specific, nickname, that, is, not, attested, in, any, other, member, of, i, ka, s, family, in, the, years, 1378, 1384, i, ka, s, name, appears, on, several, property, documents, which, indicate, that, he, was, struggling, with, long, term, financial, problems, in, 1381, i, ka, is, attested, in, prague, in, connection, with, the, settlement, of, the, inheritance, on, the, trocnov, estate, it, is, unclear, how, to, connect, this, stay, with, piccolomini, s, later, report, that, young, ka, received, an, education, at, the, prague, royal, court, a, 1384, document, also, mentions, some, kate, ina, a, wife, of, johannes, dictus, zizka, this, document, states, that, i, ka, sold, the, field, he, had, once, acquired, from, kate, ina, as, a, dowry, after, this, date, i, ka, s, name, disappears, from, historical, documents, for, 20, years, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, he, became, a, mercenary, soldier, although, some, of, the, south, bohemian, nobility, led, by, henry, iii, of, rosenberg, took, part, in, various, revolts, against, king, wenceslaus, iv, of, bohemia, at, the, turn, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, the, king, was, even, held, captive, in, the, rosenberg, castles, of, p, b, nice, and, esk, krumlov, for, a, short, time, there, is, no, evidence, of, i, ka, s, participation, in, these, conflicts, it, is, supposed, that, in, the, early, years, of, the, 15th, century, jan, i, ka, already, controlled, his, family, property, however, the, family, probably, got, into, financial, problems, and, started, selling, parts, of, their, estate, some, sources, suggest, that, i, ka, s, father, took, the, place, of, the, royal, gamekeeper, before, he, died, in, 1407, near, plze, and, i, ka, himself, might, have, been, taken, into, the, royal, service, too, but, the, evidence, is, not, clear, enough, however, beginning, in, 1406, i, ka, starts, appearing, in, the, black, book, acta, negra, maleficorum, of, the, rosenberg, estate, as, an, accused, bandit, unfortunately, the, reasons, of, this, charge, are, not, known, but, the, fact, that, he, declared, open, hostility, to, henry, of, rosenberg, and, also, to, the, city, of, bud, jovice, and, their, allies, suggests, that, he, was, trying, to, fight, some, injustice, against, his, house, and, to, enforce, some, of, his, rights, in, this, way, mahel, assigns, the, boom, of, south, bohemian, banditry, in, that, time, to, the, continual, growth, of, the, estates, of, the, rich, house, of, rosenberg, and, of, the, church, estates, and, simultaneous, indebtedness, and, pauperization, of, the, lower, gentry, together, with, the, thirst, for, land, among, their, subjects, which, resulted, in, social, tension, in, the, area, these, circumstances, may, have, eventually, forced, i, ka, to, leave, his, residence, in, trocnov, historian, tomek, also, speculated, that, he, might, have, been, forcibly, deprived, of, his, small, hereditary, property, which, was, not, uncommon, in, that, time, as, a, result, he, started, leading, the, life, of, an, outlaw, partly, supported, by, the, local, nobleman, valkoun, in, any, case, violence, broke, out, and, i, ka, tried, to, harm, his, enemies, on, any, possible, occasion, using, as, his, allies, also, local, bandits, led, by, mat, j, v, dce, matthew, the, leader, who, were, seeking, only, financial, profit, the, group, camped, in, various, places, including, a, farm, in, the, village, of, sedlo, nowadays, part, of, m, a, mill, not, far, from, lomnice, nad, lu, nic, at, a, house, of, an, unknown, woman, in, hlavatce, or, simply, in, the, woods, during, that, period, robbery, holding, people, for, ransom, and, attacking, small, towns, were, the, main, source, of, the, group, s, income, they, used, it, to, pay, their, living, expenses, including, paying, temporary, hosts, and, to, pay, spies, i, ka, took, part, in, these, raids, and, at, least, one, murder, a, man, belonging, to, the, cohort, of, henry, of, rosenberg, i, ka, and, the, bandits, were, also, in, touch, with, some, more, powerful, enemies, of, henry, of, rosenberg, for, example, in, 1408, i, ka, took, part, in, preparations, for, conquering, the, castle, hus, near, prachatice, whose, burgrave, was, mikul, of, hus, who, later, became, one, of, first, commandants, in, i, ka, s, army, in, the, beginning, of, the, hussite, wars, he, also, negotiated, with, ale, of, b, tov, to, secure, jan, s, help, attempting, to, conquer, the, towns, of, nov, hrady, and, t, ebo, another, nobleman, asking, jan, s, help, was, erhart, of, kun, t, t, who, wanted, to, capture, the, stronghold, of, slov, nice, some, of, i, ka, s, companions, were, eventually, captured, tortured, and, executed, including, mat, j, v, dce, i, ka, s, situation, changed, on, 25, of, april, 1409, when, king, wenceslas, agreed, that, his, conflict, with, the, city, of, bud, jovice, should, be, finished, and, on, 27, june, he, pardoned, him, calling, him, faithful, and, beloved, by, a, special, letter, at, the, same, time, he, ordered, the, city, council, of, bud, jovice, to, do, so, too, this, suggests, that, the, king, admitted, that, i, ka, was, at, least, partly, justified, in, the, conflict, according, to, the, polish, chronicler, jan, d, ugosz, in, the, following, year, 1410, i, ka, served, as, a, mercenary, during, the, polish, lithuanian, teutonic, war, it, is, assumed, that, he, was, on, the, winning, polish, lithuanian, side, of, the, battle, of, grunwald, also, called, the, 1st, battle, of, tannenberg, one, of, the, largest, battles, in, medieval, europe, it, was, fought, on, 15, july, 1410, and, the, alliance, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, led, respectively, by, king, of, poland, jogaila, w, adys, aw, ii, jagie, o, and, grand, duke, vytautas, witold, decisively, defeated, the, teutonic, knights, led, by, grand, master, ulrich, von, jungingen, d, ugosz, reports, that, after, the, battle, i, ka, was, serving, in, the, garrison, of, the, town, of, radzy, the, place, of, i, ka, s, activity, in, the, years, 1411, 1419, is, not, entirely, certain, according, to, a, later, report, by, luk, pra, sk, from, 1527, i, ka, entered, the, service, of, sophia, of, bavaria, the, wife, of, wenceslas, iv, as, her, chamberlain, and, he, accompanied, her, when, she, was, attending, the, preachings, of, jan, hus, given, that, hus, went, to, the, south, bohemian, exile, in, 1413, this, report, must, relate, to, the, years, 1411, 1412, according, to, the, hussite, historian, vav, inec, z, b, ezov, vav, inec, of, b, ezov, who, knew, i, ka, personally, and, referred, to, the, events, of, 1419, the, future, hussite, leader, then, served, as, a, familiaris, regis, bohemiae, literally, a, family, member, of, the, bohemian, king, i, e, a, king, s, courtier, this, is, confirmed, by, later, chronicles, from, the, 16th, century, which, specifically, highlight, the, exceptional, position, that, i, ka, had, among, the, servants, of, wenceslas, iv, it, is, possible, that, i, ka, took, part, in, the, unsuccessful, war, of, the, polish, king, against, the, teutonic, knights, in, 1414, but, concrete, evidence, is, lacking, however, it, is, interesting, that, just, one, month, after, the, end, of, this, war, campaign, on, 7, november, 1414, a, house, in, na, p, kop, street, in, prague, was, bought, by, the, one, eyed, royal, doorman, janek, janek, portulanus, regius, czech, historiography, generally, accepts, that, this, doorman, was, identical, with, i, ka, on, 27, may, 1416, the, doorman, janek, sells, this, house, and, buys, another, smaller, one, in, the, old, town, jan, i, ka, made, his, first, significant, mark, in, history, on, 30, july, 1419, in, prague, when, he, joined, a, hussite, procession, led, by, the, priest, jan, elivsk, the, crowd, gathered, in, front, of, the, new, town, hall, and, demanded, the, release, of, several, hussites, held, in, prison, when, these, demands, were, rejected, by, the, councilors, the, crowd, stormed, the, town, hall, and, threw, the, councilors, out, of, the, windows, this, so, called, first, defenestration, of, prague, is, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, the, hussite, revolution, wenceslaus, iv, died, 17, days, after, hearing, about, these, events, likely, from, a, heart, attack, the, hussites, subsequently, seized, the, city, and, expelled, all, their, opponents, on, 13, november, 1419, a, temporary, armistice, was, concluded, between, the, partisans, of, king, sigismund, the, last, emperor, of, the, house, of, luxemburg, and, the, citizens, of, prague, i, ka, disapproved, of, this, compromise, and, left, prague, for, plze, one, of, the, richest, cities, of, the, kingdom, with, his, followers, but, soon, left, that, city, on, 25, march, 1420, he, defeated, the, partisans, of, sigismund, at, sudom, the, first, pitched, battle, of, the, hussite, wars, he, later, arrived, at, t, bor, the, then, recently, established, stronghold, of, the, hussite, movement, the, ecclesiastical, organization, of, tabor, had, a, somewhat, puritanical, character, with, a, very, strict, military, discipline, being, instituted, though, the, government, was, established, on, a, thoroughly, democratic, basis, i, ka, took, a, large, part, in, the, organization, of, the, new, military, community, and, became, one, of, the, four, captains, of, the, people, hejtman, who, were, at, its, head, i, ka, helped, develop, tactics, of, using, wagon, forts, called, vozov, hradba, in, czech, or, wagenburg, by, the, germans, as, mobile, fortifications, when, the, hussite, army, faced, a, numerically, superior, opponent, they, prepared, carts, for, the, battle, by, forming, them, into, squares, or, circles, the, carts, were, joined, wheel, to, wheel, by, chains, and, positioned, aslant, with, their, corners, attached, to, each, other, so, that, horses, could, be, harnessed, to, them, quickly, if, necessary, in, front, of, this, wall, of, carts, a, ditch, was, dug, by, camp, followers, the, crew, of, each, cart, consisted, of, 16, 22, soldiers, 4, 8, crossbowmen, 2, handgunners, 6, 8, soldiers, equipped, with, pikes, or, flails, the, flail, was, the, hussite, national, weapon, 2, shield, carriers, and, 2, drivers, the, hussites, battle, consisted, of, two, stages, the, first, defensive, the, second, an, offensive, counterattack, in, the, first, stage, the, army, placed, the, carts, near, the, enemy, army, and, by, means, of, artillery, fire, provoked, the, enemy, into, battle, the, artillery, would, usually, inflict, heavy, casualties, at, close, range, in, order, to, avoid, more, losses, the, enemy, knights, finally, attacked, then, the, infantry, hidden, behind, the, carts, used, firearms, and, crossbows, to, ward, off, the, attack, weakening, the, enemy, the, shooters, aimed, first, at, the, horses, depriving, the, cavalry, of, its, main, advantage, many, of, the, knights, died, as, their, horses, were, shot, and, they, fell, as, soon, as, the, enemy, s, morale, was, lowered, the, second, stage, an, offensive, counterattack, began, the, infantry, and, the, cavalry, burst, out, from, behind, the, carts, striking, violently, at, the, enemy, mostly, from, the, flanks, while, fighting, on, the, flanks, and, being, shelled, from, the, carts, the, enemy, was, not, able, to, put, up, much, resistance, they, were, forced, to, withdraw, leaving, behind, dismounted, knights, in, heavy, armor, who, were, unable, to, escape, the, battlefield, the, enemy, armies, suffered, heavy, losses, and, the, hussites, soon, had, the, reputation, of, not, taking, captives, the, hussite, wars, also, marked, the, earliest, successful, use, of, pistols, on, the, battlefield, and, i, ka, was, an, innovator, in, the, use, of, gunpowder, he, was, the, first, european, commander, to, maneuver, on, the, field, with, cannon, of, medium, caliber, mounted, on, carts, in, between, the, wagons, the, czechs, called, the, handgun, a, p, ala, and, anti, infantry, field, guns, houfnice, from, which, the, english, words, pistol, and, howitzer, have, been, derived, the, germans, had, just, started, corning, gunpowder, making, it, suitable, for, use, in, smaller, tactical, weapons, a, handgunner, on, an, open, field, armed, with, only, a, single, shot, weapon, and, without, a, bayonette, was, no, match, for, a, charging, knight, on, a, horse, however, from, behind, a, castle, wall, or, from, within, the, enclosure, of, the, wagenburg, massed, and, disciplined, gunmen, could, use, the, handgun, to, its, greatest, potential, from, his, experiences, at, the, battle, of, grunwald, i, ka, knew, exactly, how, his, enemies, would, attack, and, he, found, new, ways, to, defeat, forces, numerically, superior, to, his, own, the, hussite, wars, were, fought, to, win, recognition, of, faith, of, the, hussites, the, forerunners, of, the, protestant, reformation, and, though, predominantly, a, religious, movement, it, was, also, propelled, by, social, issues, and, strengthened, czech, national, awareness, the, catholic, church, deemed, hus, s, teachings, heretical, he, was, excommunicated, in, 1411, condemned, by, the, council, of, constance, and, burned, at, the, stake, in, 1415, the, wars, proper, began, in, july, 1419, with, the, first, defenestration, of, prague, when, protesting, hussites, threw, the, town, councillors, and, the, judge, out, the, windows, of, the, new, town, hall, it, has, been, reputed, that, king, wenceslaus, iv, was, so, stunned, by, the, defenestration, that, he, died, from, the, shock, shortly, afterward, on, 16, august, 1419, this, led, to, the, armed, conflict, in, which, i, ka, was, to, earn, his, fame, king, sigismund, was, king, of, hungary, but, only, the, titular, king, of, bohemia, sigismund, had, acquired, a, claim, on, the, bohemian, crown, though, it, was, then, in, question, and, remained, so, till, much, later, whether, bohemia, was, a, hereditary, or, an, elective, monarchy, especially, as, the, line, through, which, sigismund, claimed, the, throne, had, accepted, that, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, was, an, elective, monarchy, elected, by, the, nobles, and, thus, the, regent, of, the, kingdom, en, k, of, wartenberg, also, explicitly, stated, that, sigismund, had, not, been, elected, as, reason, for, sigismund, s, claim, to, not, be, accepted, a, firm, adherent, of, the, church, of, rome, sigismund, was, successful, in, obtaining, aid, from, pope, martin, v, who, issued, a, bull, on, 17, march, 1420, which, proclaimed, a, crusade, for, the, destruction, of, the, john, wycliffe, hussites, and, all, other, heretics, in, bohemia, sigismund, and, many, german, princes, arrived, before, the, walls, of, prague, on, 30, june, at, the, head, of, a, vast, army, of, crusaders, from, all, parts, of, europe, largely, consisting, of, adventurers, attracted, by, the, possibility, of, pillage, they, immediately, began, a, siege, of, the, city, and, i, ka, was, compelled, to, defend, the, kingdom, he, was, a, pragmatist, in, developing, his, military, strategy, his, army, consisted, of, farmers, and, peasants, lacking, both, the, funds, and, equipment, to, be, classic, soldiers, with, sword, horse, and, armor, so, i, ka, used, their, farmers, skills, to, boost, their, military, efficiency, he, adapted, tools, of, agriculture, into, tools, of, war, the, agricultural, flail, was, transformed, into, the, flail, menaced, by, sigismund, the, citizens, of, prague, entreated, the, taborites, for, assistance, led, by, i, ka, and, their, other, captains, the, taborites, set, out, to, take, part, in, the, defence, of, the, capital, at, prague, i, ka, and, his, men, took, up, a, strong, position, on, the, hill, just, outside, the, city, known, as, the, v, tkov, now, in, i, kov, a, district, of, prague, named, after, the, battle, in, his, honour, on, 14, july, the, armies, of, sigismund, made, a, general, attack, a, strong, german, crusader, led, force, assaulted, the, position, on, the, v, tkov, the, stronghold, that, secured, the, hussite, communications, with, the, open, country, thanks, to, i, ka, s, personal, leadership, the, attack, was, thrown, back, and, the, forces, of, sigismund, abandoned, the, siege, on, august, 22, the, taborites, left, prague, and, returned, to, t, bor, though, sigismund, had, retired, from, prague, the, castles, of, vy, ehrad, and, hrad, any, remained, in, possession, of, his, troops, the, citizens, of, prague, laid, siege, to, the, vy, ehrad, see, battle, of, vy, ehrad, and, towards, the, end, of, october, the, garrison, was, on, the, point, of, capitulating, through, famine, sigismund, attempted, to, relieve, the, fortress, but, was, decisively, defeated, by, the, hussites, on, november, 1, near, the, village, of, pankr, c, the, castles, of, vy, ehrad, and, hrad, any, now, capitulated, and, shortly, afterwards, almost, all, bohemia, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, hussites, i, ka, now, engaged, in, constant, warfare, with, the, partisans, of, sigismund, particularly, with, the, powerful, romanist, old, ich, ii, of, ro, mberk, through, this, struggle, the, hussites, obtained, possession, of, the, greater, part, of, bohemia, from, sigismund, it, was, proposed, to, elect, the, grand, duke, of, lithuania, vytautas, to, the, throne, however, the, estates, of, bohemia, and, moravia, met, at, slav, on, 1, june, 1421, and, decided, to, appoint, a, provisional, government, consisting, of, twenty, members, chosen, from, all, the, political, and, religious, parties, of, the, country, i, ka, who, took, part, in, the, deliberations, at, slav, was, elected, as, one, of, the, two, representatives, of, t, bor, i, ka, summarily, suppressed, some, disturbances, on, the, part, of, a, fanatical, sect, called, the, adamites, he, then, continued, his, campaigns, against, the, romanists, and, the, adherents, of, sigismund, and, having, captured, and, rebuilt, a, small, castle, near, litom, ice, leitmeritz, he, retained, possession, of, it, the, only, reward, for, his, great, services, that, he, ever, received, or, claimed, according, to, the, hussite, custom, he, gave, the, biblical, name, of, chalice, kalich, in, czech, to, this, new, possession, and, henceforth, adopted, the, signature, of, i, ka, of, the, chalice, jan, i, ka, did, not, capture, any, more, properties, for, himself, during, the, hussite, wars, this, fact, was, unusual, for, the, time, and, distinguished, i, ka, from, his, contemporaries, later, that, year, he, was, severely, wounded, while, besieging, the, rab, castle, and, lost, the, use, of, his, remaining, eye, though, now, totally, blind, he, continued, to, command, the, armies, of, t, bor, at, the, end, of, 1421, sigismund, again, attempted, to, subdue, bohemia, and, gained, possession, of, the, important, town, of, kutn, hora, the, mainly, german, citizens, of, the, city, killed, a, few, of, the, hussites, in, the, town, and, closed, the, city, to, i, ka, whose, armies, were, camped, outside, the, city, walls, sigismund, s, armies, arrived, and, surrounded, the, hussites, i, ka, was, at, the, head, of, the, united, armies, of, t, bor, and, prague, and, though, trapped, managed, to, execute, what, some, historians, call, the, first, mobile, artillery, manoeuver, in, history, i, ka, broke, through, the, enemy, lines, and, retreated, to, kol, n, but, having, received,
