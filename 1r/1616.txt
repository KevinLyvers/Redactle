antoine, henri, becquerel, b, k, r, l, french, 15, december, 1852, 25, august, 1908, was, a, french, engineer, physicist, nobel, laureate, and, the, first, person, to, discover, radioactivity, for, work, in, this, field, he, along, with, marie, sk, odowska, curie, and, pierre, curie, received, the, 1903, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, si, unit, for, radioactivity, the, becquerel, bq, is, named, after, him, becquerel, was, born, in, paris, france, into, a, wealthy, family, which, produced, four, generations, of, notable, physicists, including, becquerel, s, grandfather, antoine, c, sar, becquerel, father, alexandre, edmond, becquerel, and, son, jean, becquerel, henri, started, off, his, education, by, attending, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, school, a, prep, school, in, paris, he, studied, engineering, at, the, cole, polytechnique, and, the, cole, des, ponts, et, chauss, es, in, becquerel, s, early, career, he, became, the, third, in, his, family, to, occupy, the, physics, chair, at, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, 1892, later, on, in, 1894, becquerel, became, chief, engineer, in, the, department, of, bridges, and, highways, before, he, started, with, his, early, experiments, becquerel, s, earliest, works, centered, on, the, subject, of, his, doctoral, thesis, the, plane, polarization, of, light, with, the, phenomenon, of, phosphorescence, and, absorption, of, light, by, crystals, early, in, his, career, becquerel, also, studied, the, earth, s, magnetic, fields, in, 1895, he, was, appointed, as, a, professor, at, the, cole, polytechnique, becquerel, s, discovery, of, spontaneous, radioactivity, is, a, famous, example, of, serendipity, of, how, chance, favors, the, prepared, mind, becquerel, had, long, been, interested, in, phosphorescence, the, emission, of, light, of, one, color, following, the, object, s, exposure, to, light, of, another, color, in, early, 1896, there, was, a, wave, of, excitement, following, wilhelm, conrad, r, ntgen, s, discovery, of, x, rays, on, 5, january, during, the, experiment, r, ntgen, found, that, the, crookes, tubes, he, had, been, using, to, study, cathode, rays, emitted, a, new, kind, of, invisible, ray, that, was, capable, of, penetrating, through, black, paper, becquerel, learned, of, r, ntgen, s, discovery, during, a, meeting, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, 20, january, where, his, colleague, henri, poincar, read, out, r, ntgen, s, preprint, paper, 43, becquerel, began, looking, for, a, connection, between, the, phosphorescence, he, had, already, been, investigating, and, the, newly, discovered, x, rays, of, r, ntgen, and, thought, that, phosphorescent, materials, might, emit, penetrating, x, ray, like, radiation, when, illuminated, by, bright, sunlight, he, had, various, phosphorescent, materials, including, some, uranium, salts, for, his, experiments, throughout, the, first, weeks, of, february, becquerel, layered, photographic, plates, with, coins, or, other, objects, then, wrapped, this, in, thick, black, paper, placed, phosphorescent, materials, on, top, placed, these, in, bright, sun, light, for, several, hours, the, developed, plate, showed, shadows, of, the, objects, already, on, 24, february, he, reported, his, first, results, however, the, 26, and, 27, february, were, dark, and, overcast, during, the, day, so, becquerel, left, his, layered, plates, in, a, dark, cabinet, for, these, days, he, nevertheless, proceeded, to, develop, the, plates, on, 1, march, and, then, made, his, astonishing, discovery, the, object, shadows, were, just, as, distinct, when, left, in, the, dark, as, when, exposed, to, sunlight, both, william, crookes, and, becquerel, s, 18, year, old, son, jean, witnessed, the, discovery, 46, by, may, 1896, after, other, experiments, involving, non, phosphorescent, uranium, salts, he, arrived, at, the, correct, explanation, namely, that, the, penetrating, radiation, came, from, the, uranium, itself, without, any, need, for, excitation, by, an, external, energy, source, there, followed, a, period, of, intense, research, into, radioactivity, including, the, determination, that, the, element, thorium, is, also, radioactive, and, the, discovery, of, additional, radioactive, elements, polonium, and, radium, by, marie, sk, odowska, curie, and, her, husband, pierre, curie, the, intensive, research, of, radioactivity, led, to, becquerel, publishing, seven, papers, on, the, subject, in, 1896, becquerel, s, other, experiments, allowed, him, to, research, more, into, radioactivity, and, figure, out, different, aspects, of, the, magnetic, field, when, radiation, is, introduced, into, the, magnetic, field, when, different, radioactive, substances, were, put, in, the, magnetic, field, they, deflected, in, different, directions, or, not, at, all, showing, that, there, were, three, classes, of, radioactivity, negative, positive, and, electrically, neutral, as, often, happens, in, science, radioactivity, came, close, to, being, discovered, nearly, four, decades, earlier, in, 1857, when, abel, ni, pce, de, saint, victor, who, was, investigating, photography, under, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, observed, that, uranium, salts, emitted, radiation, that, could, darken, photographic, emulsions, by, 1861, niepce, de, saint, victor, realized, that, uranium, salts, produce, a, radiation, that, is, invisible, to, our, eyes, niepce, de, saint, victor, knew, edmond, becquerel, henri, becquerel, s, father, in, 1868, edmond, becquerel, published, a, book, la, lumi, re, ses, causes, et, ses, effets, light, its, causes, and, its, effects, on, page, 50, of, volume, 2, edmond, noted, that, niepce, de, saint, victor, had, observed, that, some, objects, that, had, been, exposed, to, sunlight, could, expose, photographic, plates, even, in, the, dark, niepce, further, noted, that, on, the, one, hand, the, effect, was, diminished, if, an, obstruction, were, placed, between, a, photographic, plate, and, the, object, that, had, been, exposed, to, the, sun, but, d, un, autre, c, t, l, augmentation, d, effet, quand, la, surface, insol, e, est, couverte, de, substances, facilement, alt, rables, la, lumi, re, comme, le, nitrate, d, urane, on, the, other, hand, the, increase, in, the, effect, when, the, surface, exposed, to, the, sun, is, covered, with, substances, that, are, easily, altered, by, light, such, as, uranium, nitrate, describing, them, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, 27, february, 1896, he, said, one, wraps, a, lumi, re, photographic, plate, with, a, bromide, emulsion, in, two, sheets, of, very, thick, black, paper, such, that, the, plate, does, not, become, clouded, upon, being, exposed, to, the, sun, for, a, day, one, places, on, the, sheet, of, paper, on, the, outside, a, slab, of, the, phosphorescent, substance, and, one, exposes, the, whole, to, the, sun, for, several, hours, when, one, then, develops, the, photographic, plate, one, recognizes, that, the, silhouette, of, the, phosphorescent, substance, appears, in, black, on, the, negative, if, one, places, between, the, phosphorescent, substance, and, the, paper, a, piece, of, money, or, a, metal, screen, pierced, with, a, cut, out, design, one, sees, the, image, of, these, objects, appear, on, the, negative, one, must, conclude, from, these, experiments, that, the, phosphorescent, substance, in, question, emits, rays, which, pass, through, the, opaque, paper, and, reduce, silver, salts, but, further, experiments, led, him, to, doubt, and, then, abandon, this, hypothesis, on, 2, march, 1896, he, reported, i, will, insist, particularly, upon, the, following, fact, which, seems, to, me, quite, important, and, beyond, the, phenomena, which, one, could, expect, to, observe, the, same, crystalline, crusts, arranged, the, same, way, with, respect, to, the, photographic, plates, in, the, same, conditions, and, through, the, same, screens, but, sheltered, from, the, excitation, of, incident, rays, and, kept, in, darkness, still, produce, the, same, photographic, images, here, is, how, i, was, led, to, make, this, observation, among, the, preceding, experiments, some, had, been, prepared, on, wednesday, the, 26th, and, thursday, the, 27th, of, february, and, since, the, sun, was, out, only, intermittently, on, these, days, i, kept, the, apparatuses, prepared, and, returned, the, cases, to, the, darkness, of, a, bureau, drawer, leaving, in, place, the, crusts, of, the, uranium, salt, since, the, sun, did, not, come, out, in, the, following, days, i, developed, the, photographic, plates, on, the, 1st, of, march, expecting, to, find, the, images, very, weak, instead, the, silhouettes, appeared, with, great, intensity, one, hypothesis, which, presents, itself, to, the, mind, naturally, enough, would, be, to, suppose, that, these, rays, whose, effects, have, a, great, similarity, to, the, effects, produced, by, the, rays, studied, by, m, lenard, and, m, r, ntgen, are, invisible, rays, emitted, by, phosphorescence, and, persisting, infinitely, longer, than, the, duration, of, the, luminous, rays, emitted, by, these, bodies, however, the, present, experiments, without, being, contrary, to, this, hypothesis, do, not, warrant, this, conclusion, i, hope, that, the, experiments, which, i, am, pursuing, at, the, moment, will, be, able, to, bring, some, clarification, to, this, new, class, of, phenomena, later, in, his, life, in, 1900, becquerel, measured, the, properties, of, beta, particles, and, he, realized, that, they, had, the, same, measurements, as, high, speed, electrons, leaving, the, nucleus, in, 1901, becquerel, made, the, discovery, that, radioactivity, could, be, used, for, medicine, henri, made, this, discovery, when, he, left, a, piece, of, radium, in, his, vest, pocket, and, noticed, that, he, had, been, burnt, by, it, this, discovery, led, to, the, development, of, radiotherapy, which, is, now, used, to, treat, cancer, in, 1908, becquerel, was, elected, president, of, acad, mie, des, sciences, but, he, died, on, 25, august, 1908, at, the, age, of, 55, in, le, croisic, france, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, 49, but, it, was, reported, that, he, had, developed, serious, burns, on, his, skin, likely, from, the, handling, of, radioactive, materials, in, 1889, becquerel, became, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, 1900, becquerel, won, the, rumford, medal, for, his, discovery, of, the, radioactivity, of, uranium, and, he, awarded, the, title, of, an, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, the, berlin, brandenburg, academy, of, sciences, and, humanities, awarded, him, the, helmholtz, medal, in, 1901, in, 1902, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1903, henri, shared, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, pierre, curie, and, marie, curie, for, the, discovery, of, spontaneous, radioactivity, in, 1905, he, was, awarded, the, barnard, medal, by, the, u, s, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1906, henri, was, elected, vice, chairman, of, the, academy, and, in, 1908, the, year, of, his, death, becquerel, was, elected, permanent, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, during, his, lifetime, becquerel, was, honored, with, membership, into, the, accademia, dei, lincei, and, the, royal, academy, of, berlin, becquerel, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1908, becquerel, has, been, honored, with, being, the, namesake, of, many, different, scientific, discoveries, the, si, unit, for, radioactivity, the, becquerel, bq, is, named, after, him, there, is, a, crater, named, becquerel, on, the, moon, and, also, a, crater, named, becquerel, on, mars, the, uranium, based, mineral, becquerelite, was, named, after, henri, minor, planet, 6914, becquerel, is, named, in, his, honor
