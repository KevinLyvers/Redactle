ue, news, in, 1952, because, she, was, pregnant, with, her, second, child, after, leaving, ue, news, she, became, a, freelance, writer, for, various, magazines, including, cosmopolitan, according, to, friedan, biographer, daniel, horowitz, friedan, started, as, a, labor, journalist, when, she, first, became, aware, of, women, s, oppression, and, exclusion, although, friedan, herself, disputed, this, interpretation, of, her, work, for, her, 15th, college, reunion, in, 1957, friedan, conducted, a, survey, of, college, graduates, focusing, on, their, education, subsequent, experiences, and, satisfaction, with, their, current, lives, she, started, publishing, articles, about, what, she, called, the, problem, that, has, no, name, and, got, passionate, responses, from, many, housewives, grateful, that, they, were, not, alone, in, experiencing, this, problem, the, shores, are, strewn, with, the, casualties, of, the, feminine, mystique, they, did, give, up, their, own, education, to, put, their, husbands, through, college, and, then, maybe, against, their, own, wishes, ten, or, fifteen, years, later, they, were, left, in, the, lurch, by, divorce, the, strongest, were, able, to, cope, more, or, less, well, but, it, wasn, t, that, easy, for, a, woman, of, forty, five, or, fifty, to, move, ahead, in, a, profession, and, make, a, new, life, for, herself, and, her, children, or, herself, alone, friedan, then, decided, to, rework, and, expand, this, topic, into, a, book, the, feminine, mystique, published, in, 1963, it, depicted, the, roles, of, women, in, industrial, societies, especially, the, full, time, homemaker, role, which, friedan, deemed, stifling, in, her, book, friedan, described, a, depressed, suburban, housewife, who, dropped, out, of, college, at, the, age, of, 19, to, get, married, and, raise, four, children, she, spoke, of, her, own, terror, at, being, alone, wrote, that, she, had, never, once, in, her, life, seen, a, positive, female, role, model, who, worked, outside, the, home, and, also, kept, a, family, and, cited, numerous, cases, of, housewives, who, felt, similarly, trapped, from, her, psychological, background, she, criticized, freud, s, penis, envy, theory, noting, a, lot, of, paradoxes, in, his, work, and, offered, some, answers, to, women, desirous, of, further, education, the, problem, that, has, no, name, was, described, by, friedan, in, the, beginning, of, the, book, the, problem, lay, buried, unspoken, for, many, years, in, the, minds, of, american, women, it, was, a, strange, stirring, a, sense, of, dissatisfaction, a, yearning, that, women, suffered, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, each, suburban, wife, struggled, with, it, alone, as, she, made, the, beds, shopped, for, groceries, she, was, afraid, to, ask, even, of, herself, the, silent, question, is, this, all, friedan, asserted, that, women, are, as, capable, as, men, for, any, type, of, work, or, any, career, path, against, arguments, to, the, contrary, by, the, mass, media, educators, and, psychologists, her, book, was, important, not, only, because, it, challenged, hegemonic, sexism, in, us, society, but, because, it, differed, from, the, general, emphasis, of, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, arguments, for, expanding, women, s, education, political, rights, and, participation, in, social, movements, while, first, wave, feminists, had, often, shared, an, essentialist, view, of, women, s, nature, and, a, corporatist, view, of, society, claiming, that, women, s, suffrage, education, and, social, participation, would, increase, the, incidence, of, marriage, make, women, better, wives, and, mothers, and, improve, national, and, international, health, and, efficiency, friedan, based, women, s, rights, in, what, she, called, the, basic, human, need, to, grow, man, s, will, to, be, all, that, is, in, him, to, be, the, restrictions, of, the, 1950s, and, the, trapped, imprisoned, feeling, of, many, women, forced, into, these, roles, spoke, to, american, women, who, soon, began, attending, consciousness, raising, sessions, and, lobbying, for, the, reform, of, oppressive, laws, and, social, views, that, restricted, females, the, book, became, a, bestseller, which, many, historians, believe, was, the, impetus, for, the, second, wave, of, the, women, s, movement, in, the, united, states, and, significantly, shaped, national, and, world, events, friedan, originally, intended, to, write, a, sequel, to, the, feminine, mystique, which, was, to, be, called, woman, the, fourth, dimension, but, instead, only, wrote, an, article, by, that, title, which, appeared, in, the, ladies, home, journal, in, june, 1964, friedan, published, six, books, her, other, books, include, the, second, stage, it, changed, my, life, writings, on, the, women, s, movement, beyond, gender, and, the, fountain, of, age, her, autobiography, life, so, far, was, published, in, 2000, she, also, wrote, for, magazines, and, a, newspaper, in, 1966, friedan, co, founded, and, became, the, first, president, of, the, national, organization, for, women, some, of, the, founders, of, now, including, friedan, were, inspired, by, the, failure, of, the, equal, employment, opportunity, commission, to, enforce, title, vii, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, at, the, third, national, conference, of, state, commissions, on, the, status, of, women, they, were, prohibited, from, issuing, a, resolution, that, recommended, the, eeoc, carry, out, its, legal, mandate, to, end, sex, discrimination, in, employment, they, thus, gathered, in, friedan, s, hotel, room, to, form, a, new, organization, on, a, paper, napkin, friedan, scribbled, the, acronym, now, later, more, people, became, founders, of, now, at, the, october, 1966, now, organizing, conference, friedan, with, pauli, murray, wrote, now, s, statement, of, purpose, the, original, was, scribbled, on, a, napkin, by, friedan, under, friedan, now, fiercely, advocated, the, legal, equality, of, women, and, men, now, lobbied, for, enforcement, of, title, vii, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, and, the, equal, pay, act, of, 1963, the, first, two, major, legislative, victories, of, the, movement, and, forced, the, equal, employment, opportunity, commission, to, stop, ignoring, and, start, treating, with, dignity, and, urgency, claims, filed, involving, sex, discrimination, they, successfully, campaigned, for, a, 1967, executive, order, extending, the, same, affirmative, action, granted, to, blacks, to, women, and, for, a, 1968, eeoc, decision, ruling, illegal, sex, segregated, help, want, ads, later, upheld, by, the, supreme, court, now, was, vocal, in, support, of, the, legalization, of, abortion, an, issue, that, divided, some, feminists, also, divisive, in, the, 1960s, among, women, was, the, equal, rights, amendment, which, now, fully, endorsed, by, the, 1970s, women, and, labor, unions, opposed, to, era, warmed, up, to, it, and, began, to, support, it, fully, now, also, lobbied, for, national, daycare, now, also, helped, women, get, equal, access, to, public, places, for, example, the, oak, room, at, the, plaza, hotel, in, new, york, held, men, only, lunches, on, weekdays, until, 1969, when, friedan, and, other, members, of, now, staged, a, protest, despite, the, success, now, achieved, under, friedan, her, decision, to, pressure, equal, employment, opportunity, to, use, title, vii, of, the, 1964, civil, rights, act, to, enforce, more, job, opportunities, among, american, women, met, with, fierce, opposition, within, the, organization, siding, with, arguments, from, the, group, s, african, american, members, many, of, now, s, leaders, accepted, that, the, vast, number, of, male, and, female, african, americans, who, lived, below, the, poverty, line, needed, more, job, opportunities, than, women, within, the, middle, and, upper, class, friedan, stepped, down, as, president, in, 1969, in, 1973, friedan, founded, the, first, women, s, bank, and, trust, company, in, 1970, now, with, friedan, leading, the, cause, was, instrumental, in, the, u, s, senate, s, rejection, of, president, richard, m, nixon, s, supreme, court, nominee, g, harrold, carswell, who, had, opposed, the, 1964, civil, rights, act, granting, among, other, things, women, workplace, equality, with, men, on, august, 26, 1970, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, women, s, suffrage, amendment, to, the, constitution, friedan, organized, the, national, women, s, strike, for, equality, and, led, a, march, of, an, estimated, 20, 000, women, in, new, york, city, while, the, march, s, primary, objective, was, promoting, equal, opportunities, for, women, in, jobs, and, education, protestors, and, organizers, of, the, event, also, demanded, abortion, rights, and, the, establishment, of, child, care, centers, friedan, spoke, about, the, strike, for, equality, all, kinds, of, women, s, groups, all, over, the, country, will, be, using, this, week, on, august, 26, particularly, to, point, out, those, areas, in, women, s, life, which, are, still, not, addressed, for, example, a, question, of, equality, before, the, law, we, are, interested, in, the, equal, rights, amendment, the, question, of, child, care, centers, which, are, totally, inadequate, in, the, society, and, which, women, require, if, they, are, going, to, assume, their, rightful, position, in, terms, of, helping, in, decisions, of, the, society, the, question, of, a, women, s, right, to, control, her, own, reproductive, processes, that, is, laws, prohibiting, abortion, in, the, state, or, putting, them, into, criminal, statutes, i, think, that, would, be, a, statute, that, we, would, addressing, ourselves, to, so, i, think, individual, women, will, react, differently, some, will, not, cook, that, day, some, will, engage, in, dialog, with, their, husband, some, will, be, out, at, the, rallies, and, demonstrations, that, will, be, taking, place, all, over, the, country, others, will, be, writing, things, that, will, help, them, to, define, where, they, want, to, go, some, will, be, pressuring, their, senators, and, their, congressmen, to, pass, legislations, that, affect, women, i, don, t, think, you, can, come, up, with, any, one, point, women, will, be, doing, their, own, thing, in, their, own, way, friedan, founded, the, national, association, for, the, repeal, of, abortion, laws, renamed, national, abortion, rights, action, league, after, the, supreme, court, had, legalized, abortion, in, 1973, in, 1970, friedan, led, other, feminists, in, derailing, the, nomination, of, supreme, court, nominee, g, harrold, carswell, whose, record, of, racial, discrimination, and, antifeminism, made, him, unacceptable, and, unfit, to, sit, on, the, highest, court, in, the, land, to, virtually, everyone, in, the, civil, rights, and, feminist, movements, friedan, s, impassioned, testimony, before, the, senate, helped, sink, carswell, s, nomination, in, 1971, friedan, along, with, many, other, leading, women, s, movement, leaders, including, gloria, steinem, with, whom, she, had, a, legendary, rivalry, founded, the, national, women, s, political, caucus, in, 1972, friedan, unsuccessfully, ran, as, a, delegate, to, the, 1972, democratic, national, convention, in, support, of, congresswoman, shirley, chisholm, that, year, at, the, dnc, friedan, played, a, very, prominent, role, and, addressed, the, convention, although, she, clashed, with, other, women, notably, steinem, on, what, should, be, done, there, and, how, one, of, the, most, influential, feminists, of, the, twentieth, century, friedan, in, addition, to, many, others, opposed, equating, feminism, with, lesbianism, as, early, as, 1964, very, early, in, the, movement, and, only, a, year, after, the, publication, of, the, feminine, mystique, friedan, appeared, on, television, to, address, the, fact, the, media, was, at, that, point, trying, to, dismiss, the, movement, as, a, joke, and, centering, argument, and, debate, around, whether, or, not, to, wear, bras, and, other, issues, considered, ridiculous, in, 1982, after, the, second, wave, she, wrote, a, book, for, the, post, feminist, 1980s, called, the, second, stage, about, family, life, premised, on, women, having, conquered, social, and, legal, obstacles, she, pushed, the, feminist, movement, to, focus, on, economic, issues, especially, equality, in, employment, and, business, as, well, as, provision, for, child, care, and, other, means, by, which, both, women, and, men, could, balance, family, and, work, she, tried, to, lessen, the, focuses, on, abortion, as, an, issue, already, won, and, on, rape, and, pornography, which, she, believed, most, women, did, not, consider, to, be, high, priorities, when, she, grew, up, in, peoria, illinois, she, knew, only, one, gay, man, she, said, the, whole, idea, of, homosexuality, made, me, profoundly, uneasy, she, later, acknowledged, that, she, had, been, very, square, and, was, uncomfortable, about, homosexuality, the, women, s, movement, was, not, about, sex, but, about, equal, opportunity, in, jobs, and, all, the, rest, of, it, yes, i, suppose, you, have, to, say, that, freedom, of, sexual, choice, is, part, of, that, but, it, shouldn, t, be, the, main, issue, she, ignored, lesbians, in, the, national, organization, for, women, now, initially, and, objected, to, what, she, saw, as, their, demands, for, equal, time, homosexuality, is, not, in, my, opinion, what, the, women, s, movement, is, all, about, while, opposing, all, repression, she, wrote, she, refused, to, wear, a, purple, armband, as, an, act, of, political, solidarity, considering, it, not, part, of, the, mainstream, issues, of, abortion, and, child, care, but, in, 1977, at, the, national, women, s, conference, she, seconded, a, lesbian, rights, resolution, which, everyone, thought, i, would, oppose, in, order, to, preempt, any, debate, and, move, on, to, other, issues, she, believed, were, more, important, and, less, divisive, in, the, effort, to, add, the, equal, rights, amendment, era, to, the, u, s, constitution, she, accepted, lesbian, sexuality, albeit, not, its, politicization, in, 1995, at, the, united, nations, fourth, world, conference, on, women, in, beijing, china, she, found, advice, given, by, chinese, authorities, to, taxi, drivers, that, naked, lesbians, would, be, cavorting, in, their, cars, so, that, the, drivers, should, hang, sheets, outside, their, cab, windows, and, that, lesbians, would, have, aids, and, so, drivers, should, carry, disinfectants, to, be, ridiculous, incredibly, stupid, and, insulting, in, 1997, she, wrote, that, children, will, ideally, come, from, mother, and, father, she, wrote, in, 2000, i, m, more, relaxed, about, the, whole, issue, now, she, supported, the, concept, that, abortion, is, a, woman, s, choice, that, it, shouldn, t, be, a, crime, or, exclusively, a, doctor, s, choice, or, anyone, else, involved, and, helped, form, naral, now, naral, pro, choice, america, at, a, time, when, planned, parenthood, wasn, t, yet, supportive, alleged, death, threats, against, her, speaking, on, abortion, led, to, the, cancellation, of, two, events, although, subsequently, one, of, the, host, institutions, loyola, college, invited, her, back, to, speak, on, abortion, and, other, homosexual, rights, issues, and, she, did, so, her, draft, of, now, s, first, statement, of, purpose, included, an, abortion, plank, but, now, didn, t, include, it, until, the, next, year, in, 1980, she, believed, abortion, should, be, in, the, context, of, the, choice, to, have, children, a, formulation, supported, by, the, roman, catholic, priest, organizing, catholic, participation, in, the, white, house, conference, on, families, for, that, year, though, perhaps, not, by, the, bishops, above, him, a, resolution, embodying, the, formulation, passed, at, the, conference, by, 460, to, 114, whereas, a, resolution, addressing, abortion, era, and, sexual, preference, passed, by, only, 292, 291, and, that, only, after, 50, opponents, of, abortion, had, walked, out, and, so, hadn, t, voted, on, it, she, disagreed, with, a, resolution, that, framed, abortion, in, more, feminist, terms, that, was, introduced, in, the, minneapolis, regional, conference, resulting, from, the, same, white, house, conference, on, families, believing, it, to, be, more, polarizing, while, the, drafters, apparently, thought, friedan, s, formulation, too, conservative, as, of, 2000, she, wrote, referring, to, now, and, the, other, women, s, organizations, as, seeming, to, be, in, a, time, warp, to, my, mind, there, is, far, too, much, focus, on, abortion, n, recent, years, i, ve, gotten, a, little, uneasy, about, the, movement, s, narrow, focus, on, abortion, as, if, it, were, the, single, all, important, issue, for, women, when, it, s, not, she, asked, why, don, t, we, join, forces, with, all, who, have, true, reverence, for, life, including, catholics, who, oppose, abortion, and, fight, for, the, choice, to, have, children, she, joined, nearly, 200, others, in, feminists, for, free, expression, in, opposing, the, pornography, victims, compensation, act, to, suppress, free, speech, in, the, name, of, protecting, women, is, dangerous, and, wrong, said, friedan, even, some, blue, jean, ads, are, insulting, and, denigrating, i, m, not, adverse, to, a, boycott, but, i, don, t, think, they, should, be, suppressed, in, 1968, friedan, signed, the, writers, and, editors, war, tax, protest, pledge, vowing, to, refuse, tax, payments, in, protest, against, the, vietnam, war, friedan, cofounded, women, against, gun, violence, with, ann, reiss, lane, in, 1994, friedan, is, credited, for, starting, the, contemporary, feminist, movement, and, writing, a, book, that, is, one, of, the, cornerstones, of, american, feminism, her, activist, work, and, her, book, the, feminine, mystique, have, been, a, critical, influence, to, authors, educators, writers, anthropologists, journalists, activists, organizations, unions, and, everyday, women, taking, part, in, the, feminist, movement, allan, wolf, in, the, mystique, of, betty, friedan, writes, she, helped, to, change, not, only, the, thinking, but, the, lives, of, many, american, women, but, recent, books, throw, into, question, the, intellectual, and, personal, sources, of, her, work, although, there, have, been, some, debates, on, friedan, s, work, in, the, feminine, mystique, since, its, publication, there, is, no, doubt, that, her, work, for, equality, for, women, was, sincere, and, committed, judith, hennessee, betty, friedan, her, life, and, daniel, horowitz, a, professor, of, american, studies, at, smith, college, have, also, written, about, friedan, horowitz, explored, friedan, s, engagement, with, the, women, s, movement, before, she, began, to, work, on, the, feminine, mystique, and, pointed, out, that, friedan, s, feminism, did, not, start, in, the, 1950s, but, even, earlier, in, the, 1940s, focusing, his, study, on, friedan, s, ideas, in, feminism, rather, than, on, her, personal, life, horowitz, s, book,
