and, hummel, czerny, already, extremely, busy, had, only, begrudgingly, agreed, to, hear, liszt, play, and, had, initially, refused, to, entertain, the, idea, of, regular, lessons, being, so, impressed, by, the, initial, audition, however, czerny, taught, liszt, regularly, free, of, charge, for, the, next, eighteen, months, at, which, point, he, felt, he, had, nothing, more, to, teach,

viennese, concert, on, 13, april, 1823, beethoven, was, reputed, to, have, walked, onstage, and, kissed, liszt, on, the, forehead, to, signify, a, kind, of, artistic, christening, there, is, debate, however, on, the, extent, to, which, this, story, is, apocryphal, the, family, briefly, returned, to, hungary, and, liszt, played, a, concert, in, traditional, hungarian, dress, in, order, to, emphasise, his, roots, in, may, 1823, in, 1824, a, piece, liszt, had, written, at, the, age, of, 11, his, variation, on, a, waltz, by, diabelli, s, 147, appeared, in, part, ii, of, vaterl, ndischer,

up, by, beethoven, s, 33, variations, on, the, same, theme, which, are, now, separately, better, known, simply, as, his, diabelli, variations, liszt, was, the, youngest, contributor, to, the, project, described, in, it, as, a, boy, of, eleven, years, old, czerny, was, also, a, participant, having, made, significant, sums, from, his, concerts, liszt, and, his, family, moved, to, paris, in, 1823, with, the, hope, of, his, attending, the, conservatoire, de, paris, the, director, luigi, cherubini, refused, his, entry, however, as, the, conservatoire, did, not, accept, foreigners, nevertheless, liszt, studied, under, anton, reicha, and, ferdinando, paer, and, gave, a, series, of, highly, successful, concerts, debuting, on, 8, march, 1824, paer, was, involved, in, the, parisian, theatrical, and, operatic, scene, and, through, his, connections, liszt, staged, his, only, opera, don, sanche, which, premiered, shortly, before, his, fourteenth, birthday, the, premiere, was, warmly, received, but, the, opera, only, ran, for, four, performances, and, is, now, obscure, accompanied, by, his, father, liszt, toured, france, and, england, where, he, played, for, king, george, iv, adam, liszt, died, suddenly, of, typhoid, fever, in, the, summer, of, 1827, and, for, the, next, eight, years, liszt, continued, to, live, in, paris, with, his, mother, he, gave, up, touring, and, in, order, to, earn, money, he, gave, lessons, on, piano, and, composition, often, from, early, morning, until, late, at, night, his, students, were, scattered, across, the, city, and, he, had, to, cover, long, distances, because, of, this, he, kept, uncertain, hours, and, also, took, up, smoking, and, drinking, habits, he, would, continue, throughout, his, life, during, this, period, liszt, fell, in, love, with, one, of, his, pupils, caroline, de, saint, cricq, the, daughter, of, charles, x, s, minister, of, commerce, pierre, de, saint, cricq, her, father, however, insisted, that, the, affair, be, broken, off, liszt, fell, very, ill, to, the, extent, that, an, obituary, notice, was, printed, in, a, paris, newspaper, and, he, underwent, a, long, period, of, religious, doubts, and, introspection, he, stopped, playing, the, piano, and, giving, lessons, and, developed, an, intense, interest, in, religion, having, many, conversations, with, abb, de, lamennais, and, chr, tien, urhan, a, german, born, violinist, who, introduced, him, to, the, saint, simonists, lamennais, dissuaded, liszt, from, becoming, a, monk, or, priest, urhan, was, an, early, champion, of, schubert, inspiring, liszt, s, own, lifelong, love, of, schubert, s, songs, much, of, urhan, s, emotive, music, which, moved, beyond, the, classical, paradigm, such, as, elle, et, moi, la, salvation, ang, lique, and, les, regrets, may, have, helped, to, develop, liszt, s, taste, and, style, during, this, period, liszt, came, into, contact, with, many, of, the, leading, authors, and, artists, of, his, day, including, victor, hugo, alphonse, de, lamartine, george, sand, and, alfred, de, vigny, he, composed, practically, nothing, in, the, years, between, his, father, s, death, and, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, which, inspired, him, to, sketch, a, symphony, based, on, the, events, of, the, three, glorious, days, this, piece, was, left, unfinished, and, later, reworked, as, h, ro, de, fun, bre, liszt, met, hector, berlioz, on, 4, december, 1830, the, day, before, the, premiere, of, the, symphonie, fantastique, berlioz, s, music, made, a, strong, impression, on, liszt, and, the, two, quickly, became, friends, liszt, also, befriended, fr, d, ric, chopin, around, this, time, after, attending, a, concert, featuring, niccol, paganini, in, april, 1832, liszt, resolved, to, become, as, great, a, virtuoso, on, the, piano, as, paganini, was, on, the, violin, he, dramatically, increased, his, practice, sometimes, practising, for, up, to, fourteen, hours, a, day, and, in, 1838, published, the, six, tudes, d, ex, cution, transcendante, d, apr, s, paganini, later, revised, as, grandes, tudes, de, paganini, aiming, to, represent, paganini, s, virtuosity, on, the, keyboard, the, process, of, liszt, completely, redeveloping, his, technique, is, often, described, as, a, direct, result, of, attending, paganini, s, concert, but, it, is, likely, that, he, had, already, begun, this, work, previously, during, the, period, 1828, 1832, in, 1833, liszt, began, a, relationship, with, the, countess, marie, d, agoult, who, was, married, to, a, french, cavalry, officer, but, living, independently, in, order, to, escape, scandal, they, moved, to, geneva, in, 1835, their, daughter, blandine, was, born, there, on, 18, december, liszt, taught, at, the, newly, founded, geneva, conservatoire, and, contributed, essays, for, l, artiste, and, the, revue, et, gazette, musicale, de, paris, for, the, next, four, years, liszt, and, the, countess, lived, together, in, 1835, and, 1836, they, travelled, around, switzerland, and, from, august, 1837, until, november, 1839, they, toured, italy, it, was, these, travels, that, later, inspired, the, composer, to, write, his, cycle, of, piano, collections, entitled, ann, es, de, p, lerinage, years, of, pilgrimage, their, daughter, cosima, was, born, in, como, on, 24, december, 1837, and, their, son, daniel, on, 9, may, 1839, in, rome, that, autumn, relations, between, them, became, strained, liszt, heard, that, plans, for, a, beethoven, monument, in, bonn, were, in, danger, of, collapse, for, lack, of, funds, and, pledged, his, support, raising, funds, through, concerts, the, countess, returned, to, paris, with, the, children, while, liszt, gave, six, concerts, in, vienna, then, toured, hungary, liszt, would, later, spend, holidays, with, marie, and, their, children, on, the, island, of, nonnenwerth, on, the, rhine, in, the, summers, of, 1841, and, 1843, in, may, 1844, the, couple, finally, separated, swiss, pianist, sigismond, thalberg, moved, to, paris, in, 1835, after, several, successful, years, of, touring, his, concerts, there, were, extremely, well, received, and, liszt, at, the, time, living, in, geneva, received, news, of, them, from, his, friends, in, paris, in, the, autumn, of, 1836, liszt, published, an, unfavourable, review, of, several, of, thalberg, s, compositions, in, the, gazette, musicale, calling, them, boring, and, mediocre, a, published, exchange, of, views, ensued, between, liszt, and, thalberg, s, supporter, the, critic, fran, ois, joseph, f, tis, liszt, heard, thalberg, perform, for, the, first, time, at, the, paris, conservatoire, in, february, 1837, and, to, settle, the, disagreement, the, two, pianists, each, arranged, a, performance, for, the, public, to, compare, them, the, following, month, liszt, performed, his, own, grande, fantaisie, sur, des, motifs, de, niobe, and, weber, s, konzertst, ck, in, f, minor, this, was, considered, to, be, inconclusive, so, the, two, agreed, to, perform, at, the, same, concert, for, comparison, on, 31, march, at, the, salon, of, the, princess, of, belgiojoso, in, aid, of, italian, refugees, thalberg, opened, with, his, fantasia, on, rossini, s, moses, then, liszt, performed, his, niobe, fantasy, the, result, of, this, duel, is, disputed, critic, jules, janin, s, report, in, journal, des, d, bats, asserted, that, there, was, no, clear, winner, two, victors, and, no, vanquished, it, is, fitting, to, say, with, the, poet, et, adhuc, sub, judice, lis, est, belgiojoso, declined, to, declare, a, winner, famously, concluding, that, thalberg, is, the, first, pianist, in, the, world, liszt, is, unique, the, biographer, alan, walker, however, believes, that, liszt, received, the, ovation, of, the, evening, and, all, doubts, about, his, supremacy, were, dispelled, as, for, thalberg, his, humiliation, was, complete, he, virtually, disappeared, from, the, concert, platform, after, this, date, after, his, separation, from, marie, liszt, continued, to, tour, europe, his, concerts, in, berlin, in, the, winter, of, 1841, 1842, marked, the, start, of, a, period, of, immense, public, enthusiasm, and, popularity, for, his, performances, dubbed, lisztomania, by, heinrich, heine, in, 1844, in, a, fashion, that, has, been, described, as, similar, to, the, mass, hysteria, associated, with, revivalist, meetings, or, 20th, century, rock, stars, women, fought, over, his, cigar, stubs, and, coffee, dregs, and, his, silk, handkerchiefs, and, velvet, gloves, which, they, ripped, to, shreds, as, souvenirs, this, atmosphere, was, fuelled, in, great, part, by, the, artist, s, mesmeric, personality, and, stage, presence, he, was, regarded, as, handsome, and, heine, wrote, of, his, showmanship, during, concerts, how, powerful, how, shattering, was, his, mere, physical, appearance, it, is, estimated, that, liszt, appeared, in, public, well, over, one, thousand, times, during, this, eight, year, period, moreover, his, great, fame, as, a, pianist, which, he, would, continue, to, enjoy, long, after, he, had, officially, retired, from, the, concert, stage, was, based, mainly, on, his, accomplishments, during, this, time, adding, to, his, reputation, was, that, liszt, gave, away, much, of, the, proceeds, of, his, work, to, charity, and, humanitarian, causes, he, donated, large, sums, to, the, building, fund, of, cologne, cathedral, and, st, stephen, s, basilica, in, pest, and, made, private, donations, to, public, services, such, as, hospitals, and, schools, as, well, as, charitable, organizations, such, as, the, leipzig, musicians, pension, fund, after, the, great, fire, of, hamburg, in, may, 1842, he, gave, concerts, in, aid, of, those, left, homeless, during, a, tour, of, ukraine, in, 1847, liszt, played, in, kiev, where, he, met, the, polish, princess, carolyne, zu, sayn, wittgenstein, for, some, time, he, had, been, considering, retiring, from, the, life, of, a, travelling, virtuoso, to, concentrate, on, composition, and, at, this, point, he, made, the, decision, to, take, up, a, court, position, in, weimar, having, known, liszt, for, only, a, few, weeks, carolyne, resolved, to, join, him, there, after, a, tour, of, turkey, and, russia, that, summer, liszt, gave, the, final, paid, concert, of, his, career, at, elizabetgrad, in, september, then, spent, the, winter, with, the, princess, at, her, estate, in, woroni, ce, by, retiring, from, the, concert, platform, at, the, age, of, 35, while, still, at, the, height, of, his, powers, liszt, succeeded, in, keeping, the, legend, of, his, playing, untarnished, in, july, 1848, liszt, settled, in, weimar, where, he, had, been, appointed, the, honorary, title, of, kapellmeister, extraordinaire, six, years, previously, he, acted, as, the, official, court, kapellmeister, at, the, expense, of, grand, duchess, maria, pavlovna, of, russia, until, 1859, jointly, with, hippolyte, andr, jean, baptiste, ch, lard, until, his, retirement, in, 1852, during, this, period, liszt, acted, as, conductor, at, court, concerts, and, on, special, occasions, at, the, theatre, arranged, several, festivals, celebrating, the, work, of, berlioz, and, wagner, and, produced, the, premiere, of, lohengrin, he, gave, lessons, to, a, number, of, pianists, including, the, great, virtuoso, hans, von, b, low, who, married, liszt, s, daughter, cosima, in, 1857, she, would, later, marry, wagner, liszt, s, work, during, this, period, made, weimar, a, nexus, for, modern, music, as, kapellmeister, liszt, was, required, to, submit, every, programme, to, the, court, intendant, for, prior, approval, this, did, not, cause, large, problems, until, the, appointment, of, franz, von, dingelstedt, in, 1857, who, reduced, the, number, of, music, productions, rejected, liszt, s, choices, of, repertoire, and, even, organised, a, demonstration, against, liszt, s, 1858, premiere, of, der, barbier, von, bagdad, faced, with, this, opposition, liszt, resigned, in, 1858, at, first, after, arriving, in, weimar, princess, carolyne, lived, apart, from, liszt, in, order, to, avoid, suspicions, of, impropriety, she, wished, eventually, to, marry, liszt, but, since, her, husband, russian, military, officer, prince, nicholas, von, sayn, wittgenstein, was, still, alive, she, had, to, convince, the, roman, catholic, authorities, that, her, marriage, to, him, had, been, invalid, her, appeal, to, the, archbishop, of, st, petersburg, for, an, annulment, lodged, before, leaving, russia, was, ultimately, unsuccessful, and, the, couple, abandoned, pretence, and, began, to, live, together, in, the, autumn, of, 1848, nicholas, was, aware, that, the, couple, s, marriage, had, effectively, ended, and, carolyne, and, nicholas, reached, an, agreement, to, annul, in, 1850, whereby, the, prince, would, receive, some, of, carolyne, s, estates, however, this, arrangement, was, struck, down, in, 1851, by, the, consistory, court, of, zhytomyr, throughout, the, decade, the, couple, would, continue, to, negotiate, through, the, complex, situation, in, 1859, franz, brendel, coined, the, name, new, german, school, in, his, publication, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, to, refer, to, the, musicians, associated, with, liszt, while, he, was, in, weimar, the, most, prominent, members, other, than, liszt, were, wagner, and, berlioz, although, wagner, rejected, the, label, and, the, group, also, included, peter, cornelius, hans, von, b, low, and, joachim, raff, the, school, was, a, loose, confederation, of, progressive, composers, mainly, grouped, together, as, a, challenge, to, supposed, conservatives, such, as, mendelssohn, and, brahms, and, so, the, term, is, considered, to, be, of, limited, use, in, describing, a, particular, movement, or, set, of, unified, principles, what, commonalities, the, composers, had, were, around, the, development, of, programmatic, music, harmonic, experimentation, wide, ranging, modulation, and, formal, innovations, such, as, the, use, of, leitmotifs, and, thematic, transformation, the, disagreements, between, the, two, factions, is, often, described, as, the, war, of, the, romantics, the, war, was, largely, carried, out, through, articles, essays, and, reviews, each, side, claimed, beethoven, as, its, predecessor, a, number, of, festivals, were, arranged, to, showcase, the, music, of, the, new, german, school, notably, in, leipzig, in, 1859, and, weimar, in, 1861, the, allgemeine, deutsche, musikverein, intrinsically, linked, to, the, school, was, founded, at, this, time, with, liszt, becoming, its, honorary, president, in, 1873, however, as, most, of, liszt, s, work, from, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, received, little, attention, and, brendel, and, berlioz, died, in, the, late, 1860s, the, focus, of, the, progressive, movement, in, music, moved, to, bayreuth, with, wagner, in, the, 1870s, who, definitively, moved, on, from, the, school, and, the, neue, zeitschrift, after, a, visit, to, rome, and, an, audience, with, pope, pius, ix, in, 1860, carolyne, finally, secured, an, annulment, it, was, planned, that, she, and, liszt, would, marry,

this, was, a, result, of, the, machinations, of, cardinal, hohenlohe, who, wanted, to, protect, a, complex, inheritance, agreement, brokered, by, tsar, alexander, ii, carolyne, subsequently, gave, up, all, attempts, to, marry, liszt, even, after, her, husband, s, death, in, 1864, she, became, a, recluse, working, for, the, rest, of, her, life, on, a, long, work, critical, of, the, catholic, church,

and, robert, volkmann, on, the, staff, liszt, himself, only, arrived, to, deliver, lessons, in, march, 1876, from, 1881, when, in, budapest, he, would, stay, in, an, apartment, in, the, academy, where, he, taught, pupils, in, much, the, same, way, as, he, did, in, weimar, in, 1925, the, institution, was, renamed, in, honour, of, liszt, liszt, fell, down, a, flight, of, stairs, at, the, hofg, rtnerei, in, july, 1881, and, remained, bedridden, for, several, weeks, after, this, accident, he, had, been, in, good, health, up, to, that, point, but, a, number, of, ailments, subsequently, manifested, such, as, a, cataract, in, the, left, eye, dental, issues, and, fatigue, since, around, 1877, he, had, become, increasingly, plagued, by, feelings, of, desolation, despair, and, preoccupation, with, death, feelings, that, he, expressed, in, his, works, from, this, period, as, he, told, lina, ramann, i, carry, a, deep, sadness, of, the, heart, which, must, now, and, then, break, out, in, sound, on, 13, january, 1886, while, claude, debussy, was, staying, at, the, villa, medici, in, rome, liszt, met, him, there, with, paul, vidal, and, ernest, h, bert, director, of, the, french, academy, liszt, played, au, bord, d, une, source, from, ann, es, de, p, lerinage, as, well, as, his, arrangement, of, schubert, s, ave, maria, for, the, musicians, debussy, in, later, years, described, liszt, s, pedalling, as, like, a, form, of, breathing, liszt, travelled, to, bayreuth, in, the, summer, of, 1886, this, was, in, order, to, support, his, daughter, cosima, who, was, running, the, festival, but, struggling, to, generate, sufficient, interest, the, festival, was, dedicated, to, the, works, of, her, husband, richard, wagner, and, had, opened, ten, years, previously, wagner, had, died, in, 1883, already, frail, in, his, final, week, of, life, liszt, s, health, deteriorated, further, as, he, experienced, a, fever, cough, and, delirium, he, died, during, the, festival, near, midnight, on, 31, july, 1886, at, the, age, of, 74, officially, as, a, result, of, pneumonia, which, he, had, contracted, prior, to, arriving, in, bayreuth, although, the, true, cause, of, death, may, have, been, a, heart, attack, he, was, buried, on, 3, august, 1886, in, the, municipal, cemetery, of, bayreuth, according, to, cosima, s, wishes, despite, controversy, over, this, as, his, final, resting, place, liszt, s, body, was, never, moved, berlioz, and, liszt, first, met, on, 4, december, 1830, the, day, before, the, premiere, of, berlioz, s, symphonie, fantastique, the, two, quickly, became, very, close, friends, exchanging, intimate, letters, on, their, respective, love, lives, which, also, reveal, that, liszt, was, aware, of, berlioz, s, fixation, on, suicide, liszt, acted, as, a, witness, at, berlioz, s, wedding, to, harriet, smithson, in, 1833, despite, cautioning, berlioz, against, it, and, they, worked, together, at, several, concerts, over, the, following, three, years, and, again, in, 1841, and, 1844, in, weimar, the, two, composers, revised, benvenuto, cellini, and, liszt, organised, a, berlioz, week, which, included, rom, o, et, juliette, and, part, of, la, damnation, de, faust, later, dedicated, to, liszt, in, return, liszt, dedicated, his, faust, symphony, to, berlioz, the, orchestration, of, berlioz, had, an, influence, on, liszt, especially, with, regards, to, his, symphonic, poems, berlioz, saw, orchestration, as, part, of, the, compositional, process, rather, than, a, final, task, to, undertake, after, the, music, had, already, been, written, berlioz, joined, liszt, and, wagner, as, a, figurehead, of, the, new, german, school, but, an, unwilling, one, as, he, was, unconvinced, by, wagner, s, ideas, about, the, music, of, the, future, chopin, and, liszt, first, met, in, the, early, 1830s, both, moving, in, the, same, circles, of, artists, residing, in, paris, liszt, attended, chopin, s, first, paris, performance, at, the, salle, pleyel, on, 26, february, 1832, which, he, admired, greatly, and, by, mid, 1833, the, two, had, become, close, friends, they, performed, together, a, number, of, times, often, for, charity, and, since, chopin, only, performed, in, public, about, 12, times, these, events, comprise, a, large, proportion, of, his, total, appearances, their, relationship, cooled, in, the, early, 1840s, and, several, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, this, including, that, marie, d, agoult, was, infatuated, with, chopin, or, liszt, with, george, sand, or, that, liszt, used, chopin, s, home, for, a, rendezvous, with, marie, pleyel, the, wife, of, chopin, s, friend, camille, the, two, musicians, had, very, different, personalities, with, liszt, being, extroverted, and, outgoing, while, chopin, was, more, introverted, and, reflective, so, it, is, possible, that, the, two, never, had, an, extremely, close, friendship, to, begin, with, and, the, fact, that, they, did, not, live, physically, close, together, would, have, been, another, barrier, on, the, topic, liszt, commented, to, chopin, s, biographer, frederick, niecks, that, marie, d, agoult, and, george, sand, had, frequently, disagreed, and, the, musicians, had, felt, obliged, to, side, with, their, respective, partners, alex, szilasi, suggests, that, chopin, took, offence, at, an, equivocal, 1841, review, by, liszt, and, was, perhaps, jealous, of, liszt, s, popularity, while, liszt, in, turn, may, have, been, jealous, of, chopin, s, reputation, as, a, serious, composer, very, shortly, after, chopin, s, death, in, 1849, liszt, had, a, monument, erected, in, his, memory, and, began, to, write, a, biography, chopin, s, relatives, and, friends, found, the, timing, of, this, insensitive, and, many, declined, to, help, with, liszt, s, enquiries, scholars, disagree, on, the, extent, to, which, chopin, and, liszt, influenced, each, others, compositions, charles, rosen, identifies, similarities, between, chopin, s, tude, op, 10, no, 9, and, the, early, version, of, liszt, s, transcendental, tude, no, 10, but, alan, walker, argues, that, no, such, connection, exists, stylistic, similarities, between, other, studies, chopin, s, nocturnes, and, liszt, s, consolations, and, even, an, influence, on, the, ornamentation, and, fingering, of, liszt, s, works, have, been, proposed, in, 1837, liszt, wrote, a, positive, review, of, robert, schumann, s, impromptus, and, piano, sonatas, no, 1, and, no, 3, the, two, began, to, correspond, from, this, time, and, the, following, year, he, met, schumann, s, fianc, e, clara, wieck, to, whom, he, dedicated, the, early, version, of, grandes, tudes, de, paganini, schumann, in, turn, dedicated, fantasie, in, c, to, liszt, the, two, met, for, the, first, time, in, dresden, in, 1840, schumann, resigned, as, editor, of, the, music, journal, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, in, 1844, ten, years, after, founding, it, the, journal, was, taken, over, the, following, year, by, franz, brendel, who, used, it, to, publicise, and, support, liszt, s, new, german, school, to, schumann, s, chagrin, in, 1848, liszt, attended, a, performance, of, the, piano, trio, no, 1, being, held, in, his, honour, in, the, schumanns, home, liszt, arrived, two, hours, late, with, wagner, who, had, not, been, invited, derided, the, piece, and, spoke, ill, of, the, recently, deceased, mendelssohn, this, upset, the, schumanns, and, robert, physically, assaulted, liszt, the, relationship, between, liszt, and, the, couple, remained, frosty, liszt, dedicated, his, 1854, piano, sonata, to, robert, who, had, by, that, point, been, committed, to, a, mental, institution, in, endenich, clara, asked, for, liszt, s, help, that, year, in, finding, a, performance, venue, in, order, to, earn, an, income, liszt, arranged, an, all, schumann, concert, with, clara, as, the, star, performer, and, published, an, extremely, positive, review, but, clara, did, not, express, any, gratitude, in, a, posthumous, edition, of, robert, s, works, clara, changed, the, dedication, of, the, fantasie, from, liszt, to, herself, after, liszt, s, death, she, wrote, in, her, diary, he, was, an, eminent, keyboard, virtuoso, but, a, dangerous, example, for, the, young, as, a, composer, he, was, terrible, wagner, first, met, liszt, in, paris, in, 1841, while, living, in, poverty, after, fleeing, riga, to, escape, creditors, liszt, was, at, this, point, a, famous, pianist, whereas, wagner, was, unknown, unlike, wagner, liszt, did, not, remember, the, meeting, in, 1844, liszt, attended, a, performance, of, wagner, s, first, major, success, the, opera, rienzi, in, dresden, the, two, met, in, berlin, at, the, instigation, of, wilhelmine, schr, der, devrient, and, wagner, later, sent, liszt, the, scores, of, rienzi, and, tannh, user, in, an, attempt, to, elicit, approval, liszt, settled, in, weimar, in, 1848, and, the, two, grew, close, wagner, still, being, located, in, dresden, wagner, wrote, to, liszt, a, number, of, times, soliciting, financial, help, in, 1849, liszt, sheltered, wagner, after, the, latter, s, involvement, in, the, failed, may, uprising, in, dresden, liszt, arranged, a, false, passport, and, lent, wagner, money, to, allow, him, to, escape, germany, for, switzerland, and, for, the, next, ten, years, continued, to, send, money, and, visit, as, well, as, petition, officials, for, a, pardon, which, eventually, came, in, 1860, to, publicise, wagner, s, music, liszt, staged, tannh, user, in, 1849, for, the, first, time, outside, dresden, and, published, two, transcriptions, from, it, writing, to, wagner, once, and, for, all, number, me, in, future, among, your, most, zealous, and, devoted, admirers, near, or, far, count, on, me, and, make, use, of, me, in, 1850, he, arranged, the, premiere, of, lohengrin, which, wagner, dedicated, to, liszt, and, he, also, mounted, performances, of, der, fliegende, holl, nder, liszt, had, intended, to, dedicate, the, 1857, dante, symphony, to, wagner, but, upon, being, told, this, wagner, replied, that, while, a, fine, piece, he, would, prefer, to, receive, money, liszt, was, offended, by, this, comment, and, did, not, publish, the, dedication, by, 1864, wagner, had, begun, an, affair, with, liszt, s, daughter, cosima, who, was, married, to, liszt, s, erstwhile, pupil, hans, von, b, low, liszt, disapproved, of, the, relationship, and, broke, off, contact, with, the, couple, for, a, number, of, years, only, learning, of, their, 1870, marriage, from, the, newspapers, nevertheless, the, relationship, recovered, liszt, contributed, financially, to, the, building, of, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, in, 1871, and, he, began, to, correspond, with, wagner, and, cosima, again, frequently, visiting, their, home, wahnfried, liszt, died, in, 1886, while, at, the, latest, incarnation, of, the, bayreuth, festival, dedicated, to, wagner, s, work, wagner, having, died, three, years, previously, similarities, have, been, suggested, between, wagner, s, faust, overture, and, liszt, s, faust, symphony, but, liszt, claimed, that, the, likenesses, of, the, themes, were, coincidental, scholars, also, note, a, similarity, between, the, opening, of, liszt, s, song, lorelei, and, the, famous, tristan, chord, from, the, opening, of, wagner, s, later, opera, tristan, und, isolde, although, there, is, no, consensus, on, whether, wagner, was, influenced, by, the, song, there, are, similarities, in, their, musical, languages, however, and, wagner, once, even, commented, to, cosima, that, he, was, looking, at, the, bells, of, the, strasbourg, cathedral, to, ensure, he, had, not, overtly, plagiarised, the, work, the, opening, theme, of, parsifal, being, very, similar, to, that, cantata, both, composers, were, also, prominent, members, of, the, new, german, school, at, his, performing, peak, liszt, was, considered, the, greatest, pianist, of, his, time, and, was, perhaps, one, of, the, greatest, who, ever, lived, his, popularity, during, the, lisztomania, period, of, the, 1840s, was, unrivalled, and, the, critic, peter, g, davis, has, written, that, perhaps, was, not, the, most, transcendent, virtuoso, who, ever, lived, but, his, audiences, thought, he, was, and, no, pianist, since, has, seriously, challenged, the, legend, liszt, s, performance, style, changed, throughout, his, life, in, his, interpretive, decisions, as, well, as, his, physicality, the, young, liszt, was, extremely, animated, at, the, keyboard, but, in, old, age, he, was, very, still, no, recordings, of, liszt, exist, so, to, get, an, impression, of, his, style, scholars, must, go, by, contemporary, writings, and, the, output, of, his, pupils, while, allowing, for, a, certain, amount, of, mythologising, around, his, extraordinary, talent, from, a, young, age, liszt, had, displayed, an, aptitude, for, improvisation, and, sight, reading, czerny, observed, that, liszt, was, a, natural, who, played, according, to, feeling, one, saw, that, nature, herself, had, formed, a, pianist, liszt, s, fourteen, months, under, czerny, solidified, his, technical, skills, as, he, enthusiastically, studied, exercises, and, works, in, later, life, however, he, would, express, the, opinion, that, despite, his, work, under, czerny, his, early, training, had, been, unfocused, and, he, had, excelled, mainly, by, force, of, personality, reviews, of, his, early, concerts, especially, praise, the, brilliance, strength, and, precision, in, his, playing, at, least, one, also, mentions, his, ability, to, keep, absolute, tempo, one, of, the, most, detailed, descriptions, of, his, playing, from, that, time, comes, from, the, diary, entries, of, caroline, boissier, butini, whose, daughter, valerie, was, a, pupil, of, liszt, s, from, 1831, to, 1832, when, he, was, earning, a, living, primarily, as, a, teacher, in, paris, boissier, records, that, liszt, did, not, keep, his, hands, in, a, rounded, position, nor, were, they, altogether, flat, but, rather, his, fingers, were, so, flexible, as, to, possess, no, fixed, position, mme, boissier, writes, that, liszt, s, hand, is, never, unwieldy, for, he, moves, it, with, grace, according, to, his, fancy, then, she, stresses, that, he, does, not, play, with, his, arms, or, shoulders, in, a, later, lesson, liszt, instructed, valerie, to, play, without, exception, entirely, with, a, wrist, action, without, any, interference, by, the, arm, crucially, liszt, emphasised, the, role, of, the, wrist, not, the, arm, in, producing, a, full, tone, for, individual, notes, and, did, so, not, just, in, relation, to, octaves, or, chords, during, his, performance, career, liszt, took, unusually, bold, liberties, with, the, score, changing, tempo, and, adding, embellishment, at, will, in, one, instance, he, decided, on, a, sudden, drastic, slowing, down, while, performing, the, scherzo, movement, of, beethoven, s, sixth, symphony, in, a, regretful, letter, to, george, sand, from, 1837, liszt, admitted, that, he, made, such, decisions, to, gain, public, acclaim, n, order, to, wring, bravos, from, the, public, that, is, always, slow, in, its, awesome, simplicity, to, comprehend, beautiful, things, i, had, no, qualms, about, changing, the, tempos, of, the, pieces, or, the, composers, intentions, in, my, arrogance, i, even, went, so, far, as, to, add, a, host, of, rapid, runs, and, cadenzas, which, by, securing, ignorant, applause, for, me, sent, me, off, in, the, wrong, direction, one, that, i, fortunately, knew, enough, to, abandon, quickly, now, i, no, longer, divorce, a, composition, from, the, era, in, which, it, was, written, and, any, claim, to, embellish, or, modernize, the, works, of, earlier, periods, seems, just, as, absurd, for, a, musician, to, make, as, it, would, be, for, an, architect, for, example, to, place, a, corinthian, capital, on, the, columns, of, an, egyptian, temple, despite, his, apparent, contrition, however, liszt, did, continue, to, make, large, interpretive, changes, while, performing, although, he, would, be, more, concerned, with, fidelity, to, the, score, and, composer, s, intentions, later, in, life, he, would, be, more, open, to, pupils, revising, his, own, compositions, and, he, himself, often, produced, different, versions, of, his, works, over, the, course, of, his, lifetime, this, attitude, was, in, keeping, with, the, shift, in, audience, preferences, that, began, in, the, 1830s, which, started, to, favour, a, faithfully, rendered, memorised, performance, over, the, improvisation, that, liszt, employed, in, these, years, certain, information, about, liszt, s, style, can, be, inferred, from, the, writings, of, his, many, pupils, musicologist, kenneth, hamilton, identifies, several, themes, which, occurred, through, liszt, s, teachings, including, avoiding, excessive, sentimentality, imagining, the, orchestration, of, the, piece, flexibility, of, tempo, and, the, importance, of, a, sense, of, music, amy, fay, studied, under, liszt, in, his, later, life, 1869, 1875, and, her, writings, align, with, boissier, s, four, decades, earlier, she, also, notes, that, liszt, kept, his, fingers, close, to, the, keyboard, to, achieve, a, better, legato, and, that, liszt, discouraged, unnecessary, hand, movements, in, contrast, to, his, flamboyant, gestures, during, his, prime, notes, by, his, pupil, pauline, fichtener, in, the, 1870s, again, stress, freedom, and, flexibility, of, the, wrist, up, to, 1840, most, concerts, featuring, a, solo, pianist, included, other, acts, such, as, an, orchestra, singers, and, ballet, the, increasing, prominence, of, the, solo, piano, virtuoso, in, the, 1830s, led, to, other, acts, on, the, bill, being, described, as, assistant, artists, with, liszt, declaring, his, pre, eminence, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, dated, june, 1839, le, concert, c, est, moi, liszt, is, credited, as, the, first, pianist, to, give, solo, recitals, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, the, term, was, first, applied, to, liszt, s, concert, at, the, hanover, square, rooms, in, london, on, 9, june, 1840, during, his, years, as, a, travelling, virtuoso, liszt, performed, an, enormous, amount, of, music, usually, from, memory, he, was, the, first, to, include, the, full, range, of, repertoire, from, j, s, bach, to, chopin, his, concerts, included, original, compositions, such, as, grand, galop, chromatique, fantaisie, romantique, sur, deux, m, lodies, suisses, and, grande, valse, di, bravura, and, his, transcriptions, of, schubert, s, schwanengesang, symphonie, fantastique, by, berlioz, and, beethoven, s, sixth, symphony, liszt, would, champion, beethoven, s, work, throughout, his, life, and, his, concerts, helped, popularise, the, hammerklavier, sonata, and, diabelli, variations, after, arriving, in, paris, in, 1823, s, bastien, rard, presented, liszt,

later, in, 1847, in, a, tour, to, kiev, and, odessa, liszt, kept, the, piano, at, his, villa, altenburg, residence, in, weimar, the, earliest, records, of, liszt, playing, the, organ, date, from, 1836, he, developed, an, interest, in, j, s, bach, s, organ, music, in, the, early, 1840s, probably, due, to, mendelssohn, s, influence, later, liszt, commissioned, a, piano, organ, from, the, paris, company, alexandre, p, re, et, fils, the, instrument, was, made, in, 1854, under, berlioz, s, supervision, using, an, 1853, rard, piano, and, was, a, combination, of, piano, and, harmonium, with, three, manuals, and, a, pedal, board, the, company, called, it, a, liszt, piano, harmonium, and, installed, it, in, villa, altenburg, in, july, 1854, the, instrument, is, now, exhibited, in, the,

smaller, version, of, weimar, s, instrument, a, combination, of, a, 1864, rard, piano, and, a, harmonium, with, two, independent, manuals, the, upper, for, the, piano, and, lower, for, the, harmonium,

1877, liszt, was, a, prolific, composer, he, is, best, known, for, his, piano, music, which, forms, the, majority, of, his, oeuvre, but, he, also, wrote, for, orchestra, and, for, other, ensembles, his, piano, works, are, often, marked, by, their, difficulty, some, of, his, works, are, programmatic, based, on, extra, musical, inspirations, such, as, poetry, or, art, liszt, is, credited, with, the, creation, of, the, symphonic, poem, the, best, known, portion, of, liszt, s, music, is, his, original, piano, work, during, the, weimar, period, he, composed, the, first, 15, hungarian, rhapsodies, themselves, revisions, of, his, earlier, magyar, dalok, rhaps, di, k, which, were, influenced, by, the, romani, bands, he, heard, while, visiting, hungary, harmonies, po, tiques, et, religieuses, also, the, result, of, a, long, gestation, was, published, around, the, same, time, and, dedicated, to, princess, carolyne, likewise, the, six, grandes, tudes, de, paganini, were,

ann, es, de, p, lerinage, years, of, pilgrimage, inspired, by, his, travels, around, europe, the, piano, sonata, in, b, minor, which, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, original, contributions, to, sonata, form, to, come, out, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, transcendental, tudes, which, are, stylistically, varied, technically, difficult, and, have, been, described, as, liszt, at, his, most, lisztian, liszt, wrote, his, two, largest, organ, works, between, 1850, and, 1855, while, he, was, living, in, weimar, a, city, with, a, long, tradition, of, organ, music, most, notably, that, of, j, s, bach, humphrey, searle, calls, these, works, the, fantasy, and, fugue, on, the, chorale, ad, nos, ad, salutarem, undam, and, the, fantasy, and, fugue, on, the, theme, b, a, c,

bach, s, cantata, weinen, klagen, sorgen, zagen, bwv, 12, which, bach, later, reworked, as, the, crucifixus, in, the, mass, in, b, minor, which, he, composed, after, the, death, of, his, daughter, in,

paraphrase, the, former, being, a, faithful, reproduction, of, the, source, material, and, the, latter, a, more, free, reinterpretation, he, wrote, substantial, quantities, of, both, over, the, course, of, his, life, and, they, form, a, large, proportion, of, his, total, output, up, to, half, of, his, solo, piano, output, from, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, is, transcription, and, paraphrase, and, of, his, total, output, only, approximately, a, third, is, completely, original, in, the, mid, 19th, century, orchestral, performances, were, much, less, common, than, they, are, today, and, were, not, available, at, all, outside, major, cities, thus, liszt, s, transcriptions, played, a, major, role, in, popularising, a, wide, array, of, music, such, as, beethoven, s, symphonies, liszt, s, transcriptions, of, italian, opera, schubert, songs, and, beethoven, symphonies, are, also, significant, indicators, of, his, artistic, development, the, opera, allowing, him, to, improvise, in, concert, and, the, schubert, and, beethoven, influence, indicating, his, compositional, development, towards, the, germanic, tradition, he, also, transcribed, his, own, orchestral, and, choral, music, for, piano, in, an, attempt, to, make, it, better, known, in, addition, to, piano, transcriptions, liszt, also, transcribed, about, a, dozen, works, for, organ, such, as, otto, nicolai, s, ecclesiastical, festival, overture, on, the, chorale, ein, feste, burg, orlando, di, lasso, s, motet, regina, coeli, and, excerpts, of, bach, s, cantata, no, 21, and, wagner, s, tannh, user, today, liszt, s, songs, are, relatively, obscure, there, are, 137, secular, vocal, pieces, 82, of, which, were, original, songs, with, piano, accompaniment, mostly, composed, in, the, 1840s, in, most, cases, the, lyrics, are, in, german, but, there, are, also, some, in, italian, and, french, three, in, hungarian, and, one, in, each, of, russian, and, english, the, influence, of, italian, opera, can, be, seen, in, the, songs, use, of, arioso, and, recitative, styles, while, in, weimar, liszt, coached, the, court, opera, singers, and, several, prominent, musicians, sang, his, songs, including, rosa, and, hans, von, milde, liszt, coined, the, term, program, music, in, an, 1855, essay, on, berlioz, s, harold, in, italy, referring, to, pieces, which, are, driven, by, an, overarching, poetic, image, or, narrative, in, the, case, of, harold, in, italy, the, piece, describes, the, scenes, witnessed, by, the, character, harold, as, he, travels, through, italy, this, is, presented, in, opposition, to, absolute, music, which, stands, for, itself, and, is, intended, to, be, appreciated, without, any, particular, reference, to, the, outside, world, this, was, not, a, new, idea, such, pieces, had, been, written, since, the, early, 18th, century, and, liszt, himself, had, written, works, such, as, the, early, version, of, ann, es, de, p, lerinage, which, invoked, his, experiences, travelling, but, he, presented, the, novel, argument, that, program, music, was, artistically, superior, counter, to, the, prevailing, view, that, such, work, was, unserious, this, developed, into, the, idea, that, the, historical, development, of, music, as, an, art, form, was, destined, to, move, from, absolute, to, representational, beethoven, s, symphonies, had, mostly, been, non, representational, but, his, ninth, symphony, had, included, some, extramusical, elements, and, berlioz, had, taken, this, further, with, harold, in, italy, and, symphonie, fantastique, wagner, saw, these, developments, as, a, stepping, stone, to, the, all, encompassing, gesamtkunstwerk, and, in, this, sense, liszt, s, programmatic, works, were, part, of, his, vision, of, the, music, of, the, future, liszt, s, main, contribution, to, program, music, was, his, thirteen, symphonic, poems, one, movement, orchestral, works, in, which, some, extramusical, program, or, idea, provides, a, narrative, or, illustrative, element, the, first, twelve, of, these, were, written, between, 1848, and, 1858, and, the, most, well, known, are, les, pr, ludes, and, mazeppa, the, symphonic, poems, were, poorly, received, by, critics, especially, in, weimar, where, liszt, was, residing, at, the, time, they, criticised, liszt, s, compositional, style, as, well, as, the, whole, idea, of, program, music, as, the, future, of, music, believing, in, the, power, of, music, to, transcend, people, s, typical, quotidian, existence, with, his, program, music, liszt, attempted, to, elevate, listeners, to, a, higher, realm, of, consciousness, he, argued, that, its, purpose, was, less, to, do, with, depicting, a, specific, scene, or, experience, and, more, about, allowing, the, listener, to, reach, a, higher, state, of, existence, such, music, would, act, as, a, more, direct, method, of, communication, than, language, allowing, people, to, share, exactly, their, own, experiences, this, view, was, endorsed, by, franz, brendel, wagner, and, friedrich, theodor, vischer, liszt, s, final, period, is, considered, to, have, started, from, about, 1869, during, which, he, wrote, a, number, of, short, and, independent, works, such, as, the, collection, weihnachtsbaum, and, a, piano, version, of, via, crucis, although, he, did, continue, to, write, transcriptions, and, paraphrases, as, well, as, sacred, vocal, music, studies, of, his, output, from, this, period, typically, focus, on, pieces, which, display, a, willingness, to, push, the, boundaries, of, tonality, and, have, an, association, with, death, and, mourning, such, as, la, lugubre, gondola, and, unstern, the, morbid, focus, on, loss, may, be, ascribed, to, liszt, s, mental, state, in, his, final, decade, when, he, suffered, episodes, of, depression, many, of, these, pieces, remained, unpublished, in, liszt, s, lifetime, liszt, s, experimentation, can, be, seen, in, his, 1881, piece, nuages, gris, its, key, signature, is, g, minor, but, ends, in, an, ambiguous, tonality, its, texture, is, generated, by, a, collection, of, fragments, rather, than, a, distinct, melody, and, harmony, and, it, uses, chromaticism, and, dissonance, such, as, the, tritone, additional, examples, include, czardas, macabre, which, repeatedly, uses, a, single, melodic, motif, and, rhythm, accompanied, dissonantly, or, with, open, fifths, and, cs, rd, s, obstin, e, which, makes, extensive, use, of, false, relations, some, of, his, sacred, vocal, music, also, shows, this, type, of, experimentation, such, as, via, crucis, which, contains, some, movements, without, key, signatures, and, with, ambiguous, tonality, liszt, published, a, number, of, prose, works, and, letters, over, the, course, of, his, life, including, his, 1863, life, of, chopin, many, scholars, have, doubted, that, he, was, their, sole, author, suggesting, that, the, writings, ascribed, to, liszt, were, written, partly, or, solely, by, countess, marie, d, agoult, or, princess, carolyne, but, there, is, no, consensus, on, this, matter, it, is, known, that, the, programs, for, some, of, his, symphonic, poems, were, ghost, written, one, of, liszt, s, notable, written, works, was, his, biography, of, chopin, started, less, than, a, month, after, chopin, s, funeral, f, chopin, was, serialised, in, the, journal, la, france, musicale, in, 1851, and, published, in, book, form, the, following, year, having, been, edited, by, carolyne, the, book, was, poorly, received, liszt, had, approached, chopin, s, sister, ludwika, and, pupil, jane, stirling, for, information, but, they, had, been, uncooperative, finding, the, timing, of, his, enquiries, so, soon, after, chopin, s, death, to, be, insensitive, as, a, result, the, work, contained, several, factual, inaccuracies, nevertheless, george, sand, who, features, prominently, in, one, of, the, chapters, admired, the, book, english, translations, garnered, attention, in, the, us, and, uk, over, the, subsequent, two, decades, leading, to, a, second, edition, in, 1879, once, again, liszt, asked, carolyne, to, help, but, her, contribution, was, so, extensive, that, liszt, considered, it, over, involvement, going, so, far, as, to, describe, the, book, as, having, been, written, by, carolyne, one, significant, essay, by, liszt, is, de, la, situation, des, artistes, on, the, situation, of, artists, which, was, serialised, in, the, parisian, gazette, musicale, in, 1835, this, work, calls, for, the, reform, of, theatres, liszt, perceived, the, physical, buildings, to, be, unsafe, and, unpleasant, and, their, managers, to, be, incompetent, he, argues, that, they, would, book, the, cheapest, variety, of, acts, without, concern, for, artistic, merit, leading, to, subpar, concert, experiences, furthermore, owners, would, blacklist, performers, who, had, appeared, at, a, rival, venue, liszt, was, also, concerned, about, the, lack, of, professionalism, of, educational, institutions, which, were, run, by, unqualified, teachers, and, charged, high, tuition, in, his, view, their, courses, lacked, rigour, and, had, an, undue, preference, for, older, music, over, that, of, living, composers, during, his, weimar, years, liszt, wrote, essays, for, audiences, on, harold, in, italy, lohengrin, and, alfonso, und, estrella, in, addition, he, wrote, the, book, des, boh, miens, et, de, leur, musique, en, hongrie, translated, as, the, gypsy, in, music, about, the, romani, and, their, influence, on, hungarian, folk, music, this, work, proved, controversial, in, the, country, with, hungarians, disputing, liszt, s, assertion, that, romani, communities, were, responsible, for, a, large, contribution, to, the, native, music, the, second, edition, published, in, 1881, contains, antisemitic, passages, included, by, princess, carolyne, liszt, also, worked, until, at, least, 1885, on, a, treatise, on, modern, harmony, entitled, sketches, for, a, harmony, of, the, future, arthur, friedheim, a, pupil, of, liszt, s, at, the, time, remembered, seeing, it, among, liszt, s, papers, at, weimar, liszt, told, friedheim, that, the, time, was, not, yet, ripe, to, publish, the, manuscript, this, treatise, has, since, been, lost, romantic, music, generally, fell, out, of, favour, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, composers, such, as, stravinsky, schoenberg, and, bart, k, took, the, art, form, in, new, directions, liszt, s, music, seemed, flamboyant, and, excessive, in, contrast, with, their, leaner, styles, and, his, work, had, neither, become, part, of, the, established, canon, nor, received, credit, for, being, avant, garde, his, piano, music, received, attention, from, few, pianists, during, this, period, and, only, a, few, select, popular, pieces, such, as, the, liebestr, ume, and, hungarian, rhapsodies, were, published, in, collections, two, notable, champions, were, ferruccio, busoni, who, delivered, all, liszt, recitals, in, berlin, in, 1904, 1905, and, 1911, and, humphrey, searle, who, organised, concerts, of, liszt, s, chamber, and, orchestral, music, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, of, his, orchestral, works, only, les, pr, ludes, and, the, faust, symphony, were, performed, regularly, during, the, romantic, revival, of, the, 1950s, liszt, s, works, and, writings, received, greater, attention, and, scholars, now, appreciate, the, wide, range, and, originality, of, his, compositions, in, the, decades, since, recordings, of, the, vast, majority, of, his, output, have, become, available, and, a, complete, edition, of, scores, is, being, published, to, modernise, the, previous, such, collection, published, by, breitkopf, h, rtel, in, 1907, 1936, liszt, competitions, occur, across, the, world, and, liszt, societies, promote, his, work, the, great, artist, s, true, significance, was, revealed, to, me, at, last, i, came, to, recognize, that, for, the, continued, development, of, musical, art, his, compositions, were, more, important, than, either, wagner, s, or, strauss, s, b, la, bart, k, on, liszt, scholar, james, deaville, writes, that, few, composers, of, the, nineteenth, century, except, possibly, wagner, had, the, same, influence, upon, succeeding, generations, as, liszt, did, indeed, one, is, hard, pressed, to, think, of, an, innovative, composer, of, the, early, twentieth, century, who, was, not, influenced, by, liszt, s, music, especially, in, its, departures, from, traditional, harmonies, and, novel, approaches, to, form, and, formal, unity, prokofiev, admired, liszt, s, concertos, which, influenced, his, own, and, stravinsky, remarked, that, he, had, admiration, for, the, great, liszt, whose, immense, talent, in, composition, is, underrated, liszt, s, piano, music, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, impressionistic, music, of, debussy, and, ravel, one, example, is, debussy, s, l, isle, joyeuse, which, has, clear, similarities, with, les, jeux, d, eaux, la, villa, d, este, a, piece, he, heard, liszt, perform, in, 1884, liszt, also, had, a, marked, influence, on, early, 20th, century, hungarian, composers, especially, kod, ly, with, his, psalmus, hungaricus, dohn, nyi, in, his, second, string, quartet, and, bart, k, who, admired, liszt, s, works, greatly, liszt, s, method, of, using, hungarian, folk, music, in, his, compositions, was, developed, further, by, these, composers, and, their, successors, who, integrated, such, themes, more, subtly, and, valued, the, authenticity, of, the, source, material, to, a, greater, extent, it, is, now, held, that, many, of, liszt, s, late, compositions, such, as, nuages, gris, les, jeux, d, eaux, la, villa, d, este, and, czardas, macabre, anticipated, future, developments, their, use, of, parallel, fifths, the, whole, tone, scale, unresolved, dissonances, and, parallel, diminished, and, augmented, triads, predates, similar, compositional, techniques, used, by, ravel, and, bart, k, liszt, also, pioneered, a, tonal, language, of, building, chords, in, fourths, which, was, a, technique, later, used, by, schoenberg, however, many, of, liszt, s, late, works, were, not, available, until, the, publication, of, jos, vianna, da, motta, s, final, volume, of, liszt, s, solo, pieces, in, 1927, so, much, of, his, more, radical, experimentation, cannot, have, influenced, composers, before, then, liszt, s, invention, of, the, symphonic, poem, had, an, impact, across, europe, from, the, last, years, of, his, life, through, to, the, 1920s, his, friend, saint, sa, ns, wrote, le, rouet, d, omphale, in, 1869, and, la, jeunesse, d, hercule, in, 1877, smetana, another, friend, wrote, m, vlast, in, the, 1870s, franck, d, indy, dvo, k, and, debussy, all, wrote, symphonic, poems, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, sibelius, was, introduced, to, the, music, of, liszt, through, his, teacher, martin, wegelius, and, the, influence, of, liszt, s, symphonic, poems, is, seen, in, sibelius, kullervo, and, en, saga, richard, strauss, also, wrote, his, notable, collection, of, tone, poems, around, this, time, and, these, are, similarly, indebted, to, liszt, liszt, is, also, credited, with, several, proto, cinematic, innovations, which, anticipate, wagner, s, more, widely, recognised, status, as, the, father, of, cinema, such, as, audio, visual, performance, practices, and, cinematic, listening, from, 1827, until, the, last, month, of, his, life, liszt, gave, lessons, in, composition, and, piano, playing, he, wrote, in, 1829, that, his, schedule, was, so, full, of, lessons, that, each, day, from, half, past, eight, in, the, morning, till, 10, at, night, i, have, scarcely, breathing, time, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, pupils, he, taught, range, as, high, as, over, 400, although, some, of, these, may, only, have, had, one, lesson, or, perhaps, even, none, at, all, in, weimar, liszt, pioneered, the, concept, of, the, masterclass, in, which, he, would, instruct, each, pupil, in, turn, while, the, others, observed, students, from, this, time, included, karl, tausig, hans, von, b, low, karl, klindworth, and, hans, bronsart, von, schellendorff, members, of, these, classes, would, also, accompany, liszt, to, concerts, and, other, events, in, later, years, some, in, weimar, would, criticise, the, masterclasses, as, a, vanity, club, more, interested, in, praising, liszt, than, in, learning, pianistic, excellence, although, carl, lachmund, commented, that, the, success, of, many, of, its, pupils, such, as, arthur, friedheim, moriz, rosenthal, frederic, lamond, and, alexander, siloti, proved, the, groups, effectiveness, liszt, offered, his, students, little, technical, advice, expecting, them, to, wash, their, dirty, linen, at, home, as, he, phrased, it, instead, he, focused, on, musical, interpretation, with, a, combination, of, anecdote, metaphor, and, wit, he, advised, one, student, tapping, out, the, opening, chords, of, beethoven, s, waldstein, sonata, do, not, chop, beefsteak, for, us, to, another, who, blurred, the, rhythm, in, liszt, s, gnomenreigen, there, you, go, mixing, salad, again, liszt, also, wanted, to, avoid, creating, carbon, copies, of, himself, believing, instead, in, preserving, his, pupils, artistic, individuality, this, was, in, contrast, to, his, contemporaries, who, focused, on, drilling, students, in, a, uniform, approach, liszt, did, not, charge, for, lessons, he, was, troubled, when, german, newspapers, revealed, that, pedagogue, theodor, kullak, had, earned, more, than, one, million, marks, from, teaching, as, an, artist, you, do, not, rake, in, a, million, marks, without, performing, some, sacrifice, on, the, altar, of, art, he, wrote, an, open, letter, to, kullak, s, sons, published, in, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, urging, them, to, create, an, endowment, for, needy, musicians, as, liszt, himself, frequently, did, category
