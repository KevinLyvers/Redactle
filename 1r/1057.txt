street, in, the, most, frequented, part, of, town, long, ago, called, octavius, but, an, altar, was, shown, there, besides, consecrated, by, an, octavius, this, man, was, leader, in, a, war, with, a, neighbouring, town, due, to, the, crowded, nature, of, rome, at, the, time, octavian, was, taken, to, his, father, s, home, village, at, velletri, to, be, raised, octavian, mentions, his, father, s,

donned, the, toga, virilis, toga, of, manhood, four, years, later, and, was, elected, to, the, college, of, pontiffs, in, 47, bc, the, following, year, he, was, put, in, charge, of, the, greek, games, that, were, staged, in, honor, of, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, built, by, julius, caesar, according, to, nicolaus, of, damascus, octavian, wished, to, join, caesar, s, staff, for, his, campaign, in, africa, but, gave, way, when, his, mother, protested, in, 46, bc, she, consented, for, him, to, join, caesar, in, hispania, where, he, planned, to, fight, the, forces, of, pompey, caesar, s, late, enemy, but, octavian, fell, ill, and, was, unable, to, travel, when, he, had, recovered, he, sailed, to, the, front, but, was, shipwrecked, after, coming, ashore, with, a, handful, of, companions, he, crossed, hostile, territory, to, caesar, s, camp, which, impressed, caesar, considerably, velleius, paterculus, reports, that, after, that, time, caesar, allowed, the, young, man, to, share, his, carriage, when, back, in, rome, caesar, deposited, a, new, will, with, the, vestal, virgins, naming, octavian, as, the, prime, beneficiary, octavian, was, studying, and, undergoing, military, training, in, apollonia, illyria, when, julius, caesar, was, assassinated, on, the, ides, of, march, 15, march, 44, bc, he, rejected, the, advice, of, some, army, officers, to, take, refuge, with, the, troops, in, macedonia, and, sailed, to, italy, to, ascertain, whether, he, had, any, potential, political, fortunes, or, security, caesar, had, no, living, legitimate, children, under, roman, law, and, so, had, adopted, octavian, his, grand, nephew, in, his, will, making, him, his, primary, heir, mark, antony, later, charged, that, octavian, had, earned, his, adoption, by, caesar, through, sexual, favours, though, suetonius, describes, antony, s, accusation, as, political, slander, this, form, of, slander, was, popular, during, this, time, in, the, roman, republic, to, demean, and, discredit, political, opponents, by, accusing, them, of, having, an, inappropriate, sexual, affair, after, landing, at, lupiae, near, brundisium, octavian, learned, the, contents, of, caesar, s, will, and, only, then, did, he, decide, to, become, caesar, s, political, heir, as, well, as, heir, to, two, thirds, of, his, estate, upon, his, adoption, octavian, assumed, his, great, uncle, s, name, gaius, julius, caesar, roman, citizens, adopted, into, a, new, family, usually, retained, their, old, nomen, in, cognomen, form, e, g, octavianus, for, one, who, had, been, an, octavius, aemilianus, for, one, who, had, been, an, aemilius, etc, see, roman, naming, conventions, for, adoptions, however, though, some, of, his, contemporaries, did, there, is, no, evidence, that, octavian, officially, used, the, name, octavianus, as, it, would, have, made, his, adoptive, origins, too, obvious, historians, usually, refer, to, the, new, caesar, as, octavian, during, the, time, between, his, adoption, and, his, assumption, of, the, name, augustus, in, 27, bc, in, order, to, avoid, confusing, the, dead, dictator, with, his, heir, octavian, could, not, rely, on, his, limited, funds, to, make, a, successful, entry, into, the, upper, echelons, of, the, roman, political, hierarchy, after, a, warm, welcome, by, caesar, s, soldiers, at, brundisium, octavian, demanded, a, portion, of, the, funds, that, were, allotted, by, caesar, for, the, intended, war, against, the, parthian, empire, in, the, middle, east, this, amounted, to, 700, million, sesterces, stored, at, brundisium, the, staging, ground, in, italy, for, military, operations, in, the, east, a, later, senatorial, investigation, into, the, disappearance, of, the, public, funds, took, no, action, against, octavian, since, he, subsequently, used, that, money, to, raise, troops, against, the, senate, s, archenemy, mark, antony, octavian, made, another, bold, move, in, 44, bc, when, without, official, permission, he, appropriated, the, annual, tribute, that, had, been, sent, from, rome, s, near, eastern, province, to, italy, octavian, began, to, bolster, his, personal, forces, with, caesar, s, veteran, legionaries, and, with, troops, designated, for, the, parthian, war, gathering, support, by, emphasizing, his, status, as, heir, to, caesar, on, his, march, to, rome, through, italy, octavian, s, presence, and, newly, acquired, funds, attracted, many, winning, over, caesar, s, former, veterans, stationed, in, campania, by, june, he, had, gathered, an, army, of, 3, 000, loyal, veterans, paying, each, a, bonus, of, 500, denarii, arriving, in, rome, on, 6, may, 44, bc, octavian, found, consul, mark, antony, caesar, s, former, colleague, in, an, uneasy, truce, with, the, dictator, s, assassins, they, had, been, granted, a, general, amnesty, on, 17, march, yet, antony, had, succeeded, in, driving, most, of, them, out, of, rome, with, an, inflammatory, eulogy, at, caesar, s, funeral, mounting, public, opinion, against, the, assassins, mark, antony, was, amassing, political, support, but, octavian, still, had, the, opportunity, to, rival, him, as, the, leading, member, of, the, faction, supporting, caesar, antony, had, lost, the, support, of, many, romans, and, supporters, of, caesar, when, he, initially, opposed, the, motion, to, elevate, caesar, to, divine, status, it, is, alleged, that, antony, refused, to, hand, over, the, money, due, octavian, as, caesar, s, adopted, heir, possibly, on, grounds, that, it, would, take, time, to, disentangle, it, from, state, funds, during, the, summer, octavian, won, the, support, of, caesarian, veterans, and, also, made, common, cause, with, those, senators, many, of, whom, were, themselves, former, caesarians, who, perceived, antony, as, a, threat, to, the, state, after, an, abortive, attempt, by, the, veterans, to, reconcile, octavian, and, antony, antony, s, bellicose, edicts, against, brutus, and, cassius, alienated, him, from, the, moderate, caesarians, in, the, senate, who, feared, a, renewed, civil, war, in, september, marcus, tullius, cicero, began, to, attack, antony, in, a, series, of, speeches, portraying, him, as, a, threat, to, the, republican, order, with, opinion, in, rome, turning, against, him, and, his, year, of, consular, power, nearing, its, end, antony, attempted, to, pass, laws, that, would, assign, him, the, province, of, cisalpine, gaul, octavian, meanwhile, built, up, a, private, army, in, italy, by, recruiting, caesarian, veterans, and, on, 28, november, he, won, over, two, of, antony, s, legions, with, the, enticing, offer, of, monetary, gain, in, the, face, of, octavian, s, large, and, capable, force, antony, saw, the, danger, of, staying, in, rome, and, to, the, relief, of, the, senate, he, left, rome, for, cisalpine, gaul, which, was, to, be, handed, to, him, on, 1, january, however, the, province, had, earlier, been, assigned, to, decimus, junius, brutus, albinus, one, of, caesar, s, assassins, who, now, refused, to, yield, to, antony, antony, besieged, him, at, mutina, and, rejected, the, resolutions, passed, by, the, senate, to, stop, the, fighting, the, senate, had, no, army, to, enforce, their, resolutions, this, provided, an, opportunity, for, octavian, who, already, was, known, to, have, armed, forces, cicero, also, defended, octavian, against, antony, s, taunts, about, octavian, s, lack, of, noble, lineage, and, aping, of, julius, caesar, s, name, stating, we, have, no, more, brilliant, example, of, traditional, piety, among, our, youth, at, the, urging, of, cicero, the, senate, inducted, octavian, as, senator, on, 1, january, 43, bc, yet, he, also, was, given, the, power, to, vote, alongside, the, former, consuls, in, addition, octavian, was, granted, imperium, pro, praetore, commanding, power, which, legalized, his, command, of, troops, sending, him, to, relieve, the, siege, along, with, hirtius, and, pansa, the, consuls, for, 43, bc, he, assumed, the, fasces, on, 7, january, a, date, that, he, would, later, commemorate, as, the, beginning, of, his, public, career, antony, s, forces, were, defeated, at, the, battles, of, forum, gallorum, 14, april, and, mutina, 21, april, forcing, antony, to, retreat, to, transalpine, gaul, both, consuls, were, killed, however, leaving, octavian, in, sole, command, of, their, armies, these, victories, earned, him, his, first, acclamation, as, imperator, a, title, reserved, for, victorious, commanders, the, senate, heaped, many, more, rewards, on, decimus, brutus, than, on, octavian, for, defeating, antony, then, attempted, to, give, command, of, the, consular, legions, to, decimus, brutus, in, response, octavian, stayed, in, the, po, valley, and, refused, to, aid, any, further, offensive, against, antony, in, july, an, embassy, of, centurions, sent, by, octavian, entered, rome, and, demanded, the, consulship, left, vacant, by, hirtius, and, pansa, and, also, that, the, decree, should, be, rescinded, which, declared, antony, a, public, enemy, when, this, was, refused, he, marched, on, the, city, with, eight, legions, he, encountered, no, military, opposition, in, rome, and, on, 19, august, 43, bc, was, elected, consul, with, his, relative, quintus, pedius, as, co, consul, meanwhile, antony, formed, an, alliance, with, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, another, leading, caesarian, in, a, meeting, near, bononia, in, october, 43, bc, octavian, antony, and, lepidus, formed, the, second, triumvirate, their, powers, were, made, official, by, the, senate, on, 27, november, this, explicit, arrogation, of, special, powers, lasting, five, years, was, then, legalised, by, law, passed, by, the, plebs, unlike, the, unofficial, first, triumvirate, formed, by, pompey, julius, caesar, and, marcus, licinius, crassus, the, triumvirs, then, set, in, motion, proscriptions, in, which, between, 130, and, 300, senators, and, 2, 000, equites, were, branded, as, outlaws, and, deprived, of, their, property, and, for, those, who, failed, to, escape, their, lives, this, decree, issued, by, the, triumvirate, was, motivated, in, part, by, a, need, to, raise, money, to, pay, the, salaries, of, their, troops, for, the, upcoming, conflict, against, caesar, s, assassins, marcus, junius, brutus, and, gaius, cassius, longinus, rewards, for, their, arrest, gave, incentive, for, romans, to, capture, those, proscribed, while, the, assets, and, properties, of, those, arrested, were, seized, by, the, triumvirs, contemporary, roman, historians, provide, conflicting, reports, as, to, which, triumvir, was, most, responsible, for, the, proscriptions, and, killing, however, the, sources, agree, that, enacting, the, proscriptions, was, a, means, by, all, three, factions, to, eliminate, political, enemies, marcus, velleius, paterculus, asserted, that, octavian, tried, to, avoid, proscribing, officials, whereas, lepidus, and, antony, were, to, blame, for, initiating, them, cassius, dio, defended, octavian, as, trying, to, spare, as, many, as, possible, whereas, antony, and, lepidus, being, older, and, involved, in, politics, longer, had, many, more, enemies, to, deal, with, this, claim, was, rejected, by, appian, who, maintained, that, octavian, shared, an, equal, interest, with, lepidus, and, antony, in, eradicating, his, enemies, suetonius, said, that, octavian, was, reluctant, to, proscribe, officials, but, did, pursue, his, enemies, with, more, vigor, than, the, other, triumvirs, plutarch, described, the, proscriptions, as, a, ruthless, and, cutthroat, swapping, of, friends, and, family, among, antony, lepidus, and, octavian, for, example, octavian, allowed, the, proscription, of, his, ally, cicero, antony, the, proscription, of, his, maternal, uncle, lucius, julius, caesar, the, consul, of, 64, bc, and, lepidus, his, brother, paullus, on, 1, january, 42, bc, the, senate, posthumously, recognized, julius, caesar, as, a, divinity, of, the, roman, state, divus, iulius, octavian, was, able, to, further, his, cause, by, emphasizing, the, fact, that, he, was, divi, filius, son, of, the, divine, antony, and, octavian, then, sent, twenty, eight, legions, by, sea, to, face, the, armies, of, brutus, and, cassius, who, had, built, their, base, of, power, in, greece, after, two, battles, at, philippi, in, macedonia, in, october, 42, the, caesarian, army, was, victorious, and, brutus, and, cassius, committed, suicide, mark, antony, later, used, the, examples, of, these, battles, as, a, means, to, belittle, octavian, as, both, battles, were, decisively, won, with, the, use, of, antony, s, forces, in, addition, to, claiming, responsibility, for, both, victories, antony, branded, octavian, as, a, coward, for, handing, over, his, direct, military, control, to, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, instead, after, philippi, a, new, territorial, arrangement, was, made, among, the, members, of, the, second, triumvirate, gaul, and, the, province, of, hispania, were, placed, in, the, hands, of, octavian, antony, traveled, east, to, egypt, where, he, allied, himself, with, queen, cleopatra, the, former, lover, of, julius, caesar, and, mother, of, caesar, s, son, caesarion, lepidus, was, left, with, the, province, of, africa, stymied, by, antony, who, conceded, hispania, to, octavian, instead, octavian, was, left, to, decide, where, in, italy, to, settle, the, tens, of, thousands, of, veterans, of, the, macedonian, campaign, whom, the, triumvirs, had, promised, to, discharge, the, tens, of, thousands, who, had, fought, on, the, republican, side, with, brutus, and, cassius, could, easily, ally, with, a, political, opponent, of, octavian, if, not, appeased, and, they, also, required, land, there, was, no, more, government, controlled, land, to, allot, as, settlements, for, their, soldiers, so, octavian, had, to, choose, one, of, two, options, alienating, many, roman, citizens, by, confiscating, their, land, or, alienating, many, roman, soldiers, who, could, mount, a, considerable, opposition, against, him, in, the, roman, heartland, octavian, chose, the, former, there, were, as, many, as, eighteen, roman, towns, affected, by, the, new, settlements, with, entire, populations, driven, out, or, at, least, given, partial, evictions, there, was, widespread, dissatisfaction, with, octavian, over, these, settlements, of, his, soldiers, and, this, encouraged, many, to, rally, at, the, side, of, lucius, antonius, who, was, brother, of, mark, antony, and, supported, by, a, majority, in, the, senate, meanwhile, octavian, asked, for, a, divorce, from, claudia, the, daughter, of, fulvia, antony, s, wife, and, her, first, husband, publius, clodius, pulcher, he, returned, claudia, to, her, mother, claiming, that, their, marriage, had, never, been, consummated, fulvia, decided, to, take, action, together, with, lucius, antonius, she, raised, an, army, in, italy, to, fight, for, antony, s, rights, against, octavian, lucius, and, fulvia, took, a, political, and, martial, gamble, in, opposing, octavian, however, since, the, roman, army, still, depended, on, the, triumvirs, for, their, salaries, lucius, and, his, allies, ended, up, in, a, defensive, siege, at, perusia, where, octavian, forced, them, into, surrender, in, early, 40, bc, lucius, and, his, army, were, spared, because, of, his, kinship, with, antony, the, strongman, of, the, east, while, fulvia, was, exiled, to, sicyon, octavian, showed, no, mercy, however, for, the, mass, of, allies, loyal, to, lucius, on, 15, march, the, anniversary, of, julius, caesar, s, assassination, he, had, 300, roman, senators, and, equestrians, executed, for, allying, with, lucius, perusia, also, was, pillaged, and, burned, as, a, warning, for, others, this, bloody, event, sullied, octavian, s, reputation, and, was, criticized, by, many, such, as, augustan, poet, sextus, propertius, sextus, pompeius, the, son, of, pompey, and, still, a, renegade, general, following, julius, caesar, s, victory, over, his, father, had, established, himself, in, sicily, and, sardinia, as, part, of, an, agreement, reached, with, the, second, triumvirate, in, 39, bc, both, antony, and, octavian, were, vying, for, an, alliance, with, pompeius, octavian, succeeded, in, a, temporary, alliance, in, 40, bc, when, he, married, scribonia, a, sister, or, daughter, of, pompeius, s, father, in, law, lucius, scribonius, libo, scribonia, gave, birth, to, octavian, s, only, natural, child, julia, the, same, day, that, he, divorced, her, to, marry, livia, drusilla, little, more, than, a, year, after, their, marriage, while, in, egypt, antony, had, been, engaged, in, an, affair, with, cleopatra, and, had, fathered, three, children, with, her, aware, of, his, deteriorating, relationship, with, octavian, antony, left, cleopatra, he, sailed, to, italy, in, 40, bc, with, a, large, force, to, oppose, octavian, laying, siege, to, brundisium, this, new, conflict, proved, untenable, for, both, octavian, and, antony, however, their, centurions, who, had, become, important, figures, politically, refused, to, fight, because, of, their, caesarian, cause, while, the, legions, under, their, command, followed, suit, meanwhile, in, sicyon, antony, s, wife, fulvia, died, of, a, sudden, illness, while, antony, was, en, route, to, meet, her, fulvia, s, death, and, the, mutiny, of, their, centurions, allowed, the, two, remaining, triumvirs, to, effect, a, reconciliation, in, the, autumn, of, 40, octavian, and, antony, approved, the, treaty, of, brundisium, by, which, lepidus, would, remain, in, africa, antony, in, the, east, octavian, in, the, west, the, italian, peninsula, was, left, open, to, all, for, the, recruitment, of, soldiers, but, in, reality, this, provision, was, useless, for, antony, in, the, east, to, further, cement, relations, of, alliance, with, antony, octavian, gave, his, sister, octavia, minor, in, marriage, to, antony, in, late, 40, bc, sextus, pompeius, threatened, octavian, in, italy, by, denying, shipments, of, grain, through, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, peninsula, pompeius, s, own, son, was, put, in, charge, as, naval, commander, in, the, effort, to, cause, widespread, famine, in, italy, pompeius, s, control, over, the, sea, prompted, him, to, take, on, the, name, neptuni, filius, son, of, neptune, a, temporary, peace, agreement, was, reached, in, 39, bc, with, the, pact, of, misenum, the, blockade, on, italy, was, lifted, once, octavian, granted, pompeius, sardinia, corsica, sicily, and, the, peloponnese, and, ensured, him, a, future, position, as, consul, for, 35, bc, the, territorial, agreement, between, the, triumvirate, and, sextus, pompeius, began, to, crumble, once, octavian, divorced, scribonia, and, married, livia, on, 17, january, 38, bc, one, of, pompeius, s, naval, commanders, betrayed, him, and, handed, over, corsica, and, sardinia, to, octavian, octavian, lacked, the, resources, to, confront, pompeius, alone, so, an, agreement, was, reached, with, the, second, triumvirate, s, extension, for, another, five, year, period, beginning, in, 37, bc, in, supporting, octavian, antony, expected, to, gain, support, for, his, own, campaign, against, the, parthian, empire, desiring, to, avenge, rome, s, defeat, at, carrhae, in, 53, bc, in, an, agreement, reached, at, tarentum, antony, provided, 120, ships, for, octavian, to, use, against, pompeius, while, octavian, was, to, send, 20, 000, legionaries, to, antony, for, use, against, parthia, octavian, sent, only, a, tenth, of, those, promised, which, antony, viewed, as, an, intentional, provocation, octavian, and, lepidus, launched, a, joint, operation, against, sextus, in, sicily, in, 36, bc, despite, setbacks, for, octavian, the, naval, fleet, of, sextus, pompeius, was, almost, entirely, destroyed, on, 3, september, by, general, agrippa, at, the, naval, battle, of, naulochus, sextus, fled, to, the, east, with, his, remaining, forces, where, he, was, captured, and, executed, in, miletus, by, one, of, antony, s, generals, the, following, year, as, lepidus, and, octavian, accepted, the, surrender, of, pompeius, s, troops, lepidus, attempted, to, claim, sicily, for, himself, ordering, octavian, to, leave, lepidus, s, troops, deserted, him, however, and, defected, to, octavian, since, they, were, weary, of, fighting, and, were, enticed, by, octavian, s, promises, of, money, lepidus, surrendered, to, octavian, and, was, permitted, to, retain, the, office, of, pontifex, maximus, head, of, the, college, of, priests, but, was, ejected, from, the, triumvirate, his, public, career, at, an, end, he, effectively, was, exiled, to, a, villa, at, cape, circei, in, italy, the, roman, dominions, were, divided, between, octavian, in, the, west, and, antony, in, the, east, octavian, ensured, rome, s, citizens, of, their, rights, to, property, in, order, to, maintain, peace, and, stability, in, his, portion, of, the, empire, this, time, he, settled, his, discharged, soldiers, outside, of, italy, while, also, returning, 30, 000, slaves, to, their, former, roman, owners, slaves, who, had, fled, to, join, pompeius, s, army, and, navy, octavian, had, the, senate, grant, him, his, wife, and, his, sister, tribunal, immunity, or, sacrosanctitas, in, order, to, ensure, his, own, safety, and, that, of, livia, and, octavia, once, he, returned, to, rome, meanwhile, antony, s, campaign, turned, disastrous, against, parthia, tarnishing, his, image, as, a, leader, and, the, mere, 2, 000, legionaries, sent, by, octavian, to, antony, were, hardly, enough, to, replenish, his, forces, on, the, other, hand, cleopatra, could, restore, his, army, to, full, strength, he, already, was, engaged, in, a, romantic, affair, with, her, so, he, decided, to, send, octavia, back, to, rome, octavian, used, this, to, spread, propaganda, implying, that, antony, was, becoming, less, than, roman, because, he, rejected, a, legitimate, roman, spouse, for, an, oriental, paramour, in, 36, bc, octavian, used, a, political, ploy, to, make, himself, look, less, autocratic, and, antony, more, the, villain, by, proclaiming, that, the, civil, wars, were, coming, to, an, end, and, that, he, would, step, down, as, triumvir, if, only, antony, would, do, the, same, antony, refused, roman, troops, captured, the, kingdom, of, armenia, in, 34, bc, and, antony, made, his, son, alexander, helios, the, ruler, of, armenia, he, also, awarded, the, title, queen, of, kings, to, cleopatra, acts, that, octavian, used, to, convince, the, roman, senate, that, antony, had, ambitions, to, diminish, the, preeminence, of, rome, octavian, became, consul, once, again, on, 1, january, 33, bc, and, he, opened, the, following, session, in, the, senate, with, a, vehement, attack, on, antony, s, grants, of, titles, and, territories, to, his, relatives, and, to, his, queen, the, breach, between, antony, and, octavian, prompted, a, large, portion, of, the, senators, as, well, as, both, of, that, year, s, consuls, to, leave, rome, and, defect, to, antony, however, octavian, received, two, key, deserters, from, antony, in, the, autumn, of, 32, bc, munatius, plancus, and, marcus, titius, these, defectors, gave, octavian, the, information, that, he, needed, to, confirm, with, the, senate, all, the, accusations, that, he, made, against, antony, octavian, forcibly, entered, the, temple, of, the, vestal, virgins, and, seized, antony, s, secret, will, which, he, promptly, publicized, the, will, would, have, given, away, roman, conquered, territories, as, kingdoms, for, his, sons, to, rule, and, designated, alexandria, as, the, site, for, a, tomb, for, him, and, his, queen, in, late, 32, bc, the, senate, officially, revoked, antony, s, powers, as, consul, and, declared, war, on, cleopatra, s, regime, in, egypt, in, early, 31, bc, antony, and, cleopatra, were, temporarily, stationed, in, greece, when, octavian, gained, a, preliminary, victory, the, navy, successfully, ferried, troops, across, the, adriatic, sea, under, the, command, of, agrippa, agrippa, cut, off, antony, and, cleopatra, s, main, force, from, their, supply, routes, at, sea, while, octavian, landed, on, the, mainland, opposite, the, island, of, corcyra, modern, corfu, and, marched, south, trapped, on, land, and, sea, deserters, of, antony, s, army, fled, to, octavian, s, side, daily, while, octavian, s, forces, were, comfortable, enough, to, make, preparations, antony, s, fleet, sailed, through, the, bay, of, actium, on, the, western, coast, of, greece, in, a, desperate, attempt, to, break, free, of, the, naval, blockade, it, was, there, that, antony, s, fleet, faced, the, much, larger, fleet, of, smaller, more, maneuverable, ships, under, commanders, agrippa, and, gaius, sosius, in, the, battle, of, actium, on, 2, september, 31, bc, antony, and, his, remaining, forces, were, spared, by, a, last, ditch, effort, from, cleopatra, s, fleet, that, had, been, waiting, nearby, a, year, later, octavian, defeated, their, forces, in, alexandria, on, 1, august, 30, bc, after, which, antony, and, cleopatra, committed, suicide, antony, fell, on, his, own, sword, and, was, taken, by, his, soldiers, back, to, alexandria, where, he, died, in, cleopatra, s, arms, cleopatra, died, soon, after, by, poisoning, contrary, to, the, popular, belief, that, she, was, bitten, by, an, asp, octavian, had, exploited, his, position, as, caesar, s, heir, to, further, his, own, political, career, and, he, was, well, aware, of, the, dangers, in, allowing, another, person, to, do, the, same, he, therefore, followed, the, advice, of, the, greek, philosopher, arius, didymus, that, two, caesars, are, one, too, many, ordering, caesarion, killed, while, sparing, cleopatra, s, children, by, antony, with, the, exception, of, antony, s, older, son, octavian, had, previously, shown, little, mercy, to, surrendered, enemies, and, acted, in, ways, that, had, proven, unpopular, with, the, roman, people, yet, he, was, given, credit, for, pardoning, many, of, his, opponents, after, the, battle, of, actium, after, actium, and, the, defeat, of, antony, and, cleopatra, octavian, was, in, a, position, to, rule, the, entire, republic, under, an, unofficial, principate, but, he, had, to, achieve, this, through, incremental, power, gains, he, did, so, by, courting, the, senate, and, the, people, while, upholding, the, republican, traditions, of, rome, appearing, that, he, was, not, aspiring, to, dictatorship, or, monarchy, marching, into, rome, octavian, and, agrippa, were, elected, as, consuls, by, the, senate, years, of, civil, war, had, left, rome, in, a, state, of, near, lawlessness, but, the, republic, was, not, prepared, to, accept, the, control, of, octavian, as, a, despot, at, the, same, time, octavian, could, not, give, up, his, authority, without, risking, further, civil, wars, among, the, roman, generals, and, even, if, he, desired, no, position, of, authority, his, position, demanded, that, he, look, to, the, well, being, of, the, city, of, rome, and, the, roman, provinces, octavian, s, aims, from, this, point, forward, were, to, return, rome, to, a, state, of, stability, traditional, legality, and, civility, by, lifting, the, overt, political, pressure, imposed, on, the, courts, of, law, and, ensuring, free, elections, in, name, at, least, on, 13, january, 27, bc, octavian, made, a, show, of, returning, full, power, to, the, roman, senate, and, relinquishing, his, control, of, the, roman, provinces, and, their, armies, under, his, consulship, however, the, senate, had, little, power, in, initiating, legislation, by, introducing, bills, for, senatorial, debate, octavian, was, no, longer, in, direct, control, of, the, provinces, and, their, armies, but, he, retained, the, loyalty, of, active, duty, soldiers, and, veterans, alike, the, careers, of, many, clients, and, adherents, depended, on, his, patronage, as, his, financial, power, was, unrivaled, in, the, roman, republic, historian, werner, eck, states, the, sum, of, his, power, derived, first, of, all, from, various, powers, of, office, delegated, to, him, by, the, senate, and, people, secondly, from, his, immense, private, fortune, and, thirdly, from, numerous, patron, client, relationships, he, established, with, individuals, and, groups, throughout, the, empire, all, of, them, taken, together, formed, the, basis, of, his, auctoritas, which, he, himself, emphasized, as, the, foundation, of, his, political, actions, to, a, large, extent, the, public, was, aware, of, the, vast, financial, resources, that, octavian, commanded, he, failed, to, encourage, enough, senators, to, finance, the, building, and, maintenance, of, networks, of, roads, in, italy, in, 20, bc, but, he, undertook, direct, responsibility, for, them, this, was, publicized, on, the, roman, currency, issued, in, 16, bc, after, he, donated, vast, amounts, of, money, to, the, aerarium, saturni, the, public, treasury, according, to, historian, h, h, scullard, however, octavian, s, power, was, based, on, the, exercise, of, a, predominant, military, power, and, the, ultimate, sanction, of, his, authority, was, force, however, much, the, fact, was, disguised, the, senate, proposed, to, octavian, the, victor, of, rome, s, civil, wars, that, he, once, again, assume, command, of, the, provinces, the, senate, s, proposal, was, a, ratification, of, octavian, s, extra, constitutional, power, through, the, senate, octavian, was, able, to, continue, the, appearance, of, a, still, functional, constitution, feigning, reluctance, he, accepted, a, ten, year, responsibility, of, overseeing, provinces, that, were, considered, chaotic, the, provinces, ceded, to, augustus, for, that, ten, year, period, comprised, much, of, the, conquered, roman, world, including, all, of, hispania, and, gaul, syria, cilicia, cyprus, and, egypt, moreover, command, of, these, provinces, provided, octavian, with, control, over, the, majority, of, rome, s, legions, while, octavian, acted, as, consul, in, rome, he, dispatched, senators, to, the, provinces, under, his, command, as, his, representatives, to, manage, provincial, affairs, and, ensure, that, his, orders, were, carried, out, the, provinces, not, under, octavian, s, control, were, overseen, by, governors, chosen, by, the, roman, senate, octavian, became, the, most, powerful, political, figure, in, the, city, of, rome, and, in, most, of, its, provinces, but, he, did, not, have, a, monopoly, on, political, and, martial, power, the, senate, still, controlled, north, africa, an, important, regional, producer, of, grain, as, well, as, illyria, and, macedonia, two, strategic, regions, with, several, legions, however, the, senate, had, control, of, only, five, or, six, legions, distributed, among, three, senatorial, proconsuls, compared, to, the, twenty, legions, under, the, control, of, octavian, and, their, control, of, these, regions, did, not, amount, to, any, political, or, military, challenge, to, octavian, the, senate, s, control, over, some, of, the, roman, provinces, helped, maintain, a, republican, facade, for, the, autocratic, principate, also, octavian, s, control, of, entire, provinces, followed, republican, era, precedents, for, the, objective, of, securing, peace, and, creating, stability, in, which, such, prominent, romans, as, pompey, had, been, granted, similar, military, powers, in, times, of, crisis, and, instability, on, 16, january, 27, bc, the, senate, gave, octavian, the, new, title, of, augustus, augustus, is, from, the, latin, word, augere, meaning, to, increase, and, can, be, translated, as, illustrious, one, or, sublime, it, was, a, title, of, religious, authority, rather, than, political, one, and, it, indicated, that, octavian, now, approached, divinity, his, name, of, augustus, was, also, more, favorable, than, romulus, the, previous, one, which, he, styled, for, himself, in, reference, to, the, story, of, the, legendary, founder, of, rome, which, symbolized, a, second, founding, of, rome, the, title, of, romulus, was, associated, too, strongly, with, notions, of, monarchy, and, kingship, an, image, that, octavian, tried, to, avoid, the, senate, also, confirmed, his, position, as, princeps, senatus, which, originally, meant, the, member, of, the, senate, with, the, highest, precedence, but, in, this, case, it, became, an, almost, regnal, title, for, a, leader, who, was, first, in, charge, the, honorific, augustus, was, inherited, by, all, future, emperors, and, became, the, de, facto, main, title, of, the, emperor, as, a, result, modern, historians, usually, regard, this, event, as, the, beginning, of, his, reign, as, emperor, augustus, himself, appears, to, have, reckoned, his, reign, from, 27, bc, augustus, styled, himself, as, imperator, caesar, divi, filius, commander, caesar, son, of, the, deified, one, with, this, title, he, boasted, his, familial, link, to, deified, julius, caesar, and, the, use, of, imperator, signified, a, permanent, link, to, the, roman, tradition, of, victory, he, transformed, caesar, a, cognomen, for, one, branch, of, the, julian, family, into, a, new, family, line, that, began, with, him, augustus, was, granted, the, right, to, hang, the, corona, civica, civic, crown, above, his, door, and, to, have, laurels, drape, his, doorposts, however, he, renounced, flaunting, insignia, of, power, such, as, holding, a, scepter, wearing, a, diadem, or, wearing, the, golden, crown, and, purple, toga, of, his, predecessor, julius, caesar, if, he, refused, to, symbolize, his, power, by, donning, and, bearing, these, items, on, his, person, the, senate, nonetheless, awarded, him, with, a, golden, shield, displayed, in, the, meeting, hall, of, the, curia, bearing, the, inscription, virtus, pietas, clementia, iustitia, valor, piety, clemency, and, justice, by, 23, bc, some, of, the, un, republican, implications, were, becoming, apparent, concerning, the, settlement, of, 27, bc, augustus, s, retention, of, an, annual, consulate, drew, attention, to, his, de, facto, dominance, over, the, roman, political, system, and, cut, in, half, the, opportunities, for, others, to, achieve, what, was, still, nominally, the, preeminent, position, in, the, roman, state, further, he, was, causing, political, problems, by, desiring, to, have, his, nephew, marcus, claudius, marcellus, follow, in, his, footsteps, and, eventually, assume, the, principate, in, his, turn, alienating, his, three, greatest, supporters, agrippa, maecenas, and, livia, he, appointed, noted, republican, calpurnius, piso, who, had, fought, against, julius, caesar, and, supported, cassius, and, brutus, as, co, consul, in, 23, bc, after, his, choice, aulus, terentius, varro, murena, died, unexpectedly, in, the, late, spring, augustus, had, a, severe, illness, and, on, his, supposed, deathbed, made, arrangements, that, would, ensure, the, continuation, of, the, principate, in, some, form, while, allaying, senators, suspicions, of, his, anti, republicanism, augustus, prepared, to, hand, down, his, signet, ring, to, his, favored, general, agrippa, however, augustus, handed, over, to, his, co, consul, piso, all, of, his, official, documents, an, account, of, public, finances, and, authority, over, listed, troops, in, the, provinces, while, augustus, s, supposedly, favored, nephew, marcellus, came, away, empty, handed, this, was, a, surprise, to, many, who, believed, augustus, would, have, named, an, heir, to, his, position, as, an, unofficial, emperor, augustus, bestowed, only, properties, and, possessions, to, his, designated, heirs, as, an, obvious, system, of, institutionalized, imperial, inheritance, would, have, provoked, resistance, and, hostility, among, the, republican, minded, romans, fearful, of, monarchy, with, regards, to, the, principate, it, was, obvious, to, augustus, that, marcellus, was, not, ready, to, take, on, his, position, nonetheless, by, giving, his, signet, ring, to, agrippa, augustus, intended, to, signal, to, the, legions, that, agrippa, was, to, be, his, successor, and, that, they, should, continue, to, obey, agrippa, constitutional, procedure, notwithstanding, soon, after, his, bout, of, illness, subsided, augustus, gave, up, his, consulship, the, only, other, times, augustus, would, serve, as, consul, would, be, in, the, years, 5, and, 2, bc, both, times, to, introduce, his, grandsons, into, public, life, this, was, a, clever, ploy, by, augustus, ceasing, to, serve, as, one, of, two, annually, elected, consuls, allowed, aspiring, senators, a, better, chance, to, attain, the, consular, position, while, allowing, augustus, to, exercise, wider, patronage, within, the, senatorial, class, although, augustus, had, resigned, as, consul, he, desired, to, retain, his, consular, imperium, not, just, in, his, provinces, but, throughout, the, empire, this, desire, as, well, as, the, marcus, primus, affair, led, to, a, second, compromise, between, him, and, the, senate, known, as, the, second, settlement, the, primary, reasons, for, the, second, settlement, were, as, follows, first, after, augustus, relinquished, the, annual, consulship, he, was, no, longer, in, an, official, position, to, rule, the, state, yet, his, dominant, position, remained, unchanged, over, his, roman, imperial, provinces, where, he, was, still, a, proconsul, when, he, annually, held, the, office, of, consul, he, had, the, power, to, intervene, with, the, affairs, of, the, other, provincial, proconsuls, appointed, by, the, senate, throughout, the, empire, when, he, deemed, necessary, a, second, problem, later, arose, showing, the, need, for, the, second, settlement, in, what, became, known, as, the, marcus, primus, affair, in, late, 24, or, early, 23, bc, charges, were, brought, against, marcus, primus, the, former, proconsul, governor, of, macedonia, for, waging, a, war, without, prior, approval, of, the, senate, on, the, odrysian, kingdom, of, thrace, whose, king, was, a, roman, ally, he, was, defended, by, lucius, licinius, varro, murena, who, told, the, trial, that, his, client, had, received, specific, instructions, from, augustus, ordering, him, to, attack, the, client, state, later, primus, testified, that, the, orders, came, from, the, recently, deceased, marcellus, such, orders, had, they, been, given, would, have, been, considered, a, breach, of, the, senate, s, prerogative, under, the, constitutional, settlement, of, 27, bc, and, its, aftermath, i, e, before, augustus, was, granted, imperium, proconsulare, maius, as, macedonia, was, a, senatorial, province, under, the, senate, s, jurisdiction, not, an, imperial, province, under, the, authority, of, augustus, such, an, action, would, have, ripped, away, the, veneer, of, republican, restoration, as, promoted, by, augustus, and, exposed, his, fraud, of, merely, being, the, first, citizen, a, first, among, equals, even, worse, the, involvement, of, marcellus, provided, some, measure, of, proof, that, augustus, s, policy, was, to, have, the, youth, take, his, place, as, princeps, instituting, a, form, of, monarchy, accusations, that, had, already, played, out, the, situation, was, so, serious, that, augustus, appeared, at, the, trial, even, though, he, had, not, been, called, as, a, witness, under, oath, augustus, declared, that, he, gave, no, such, order, murena, disbelieved, augustus, s, testimony, and, resented, his, attempt, to, subvert, the, trial, by, using, his, auctoritas, he, rudely, demanded, to, know, why, augustus, had, turned, up, to, a, trial, to, which, he, had, not, been, called, augustus, replied, that, he, came, in, the, public, interest, although, primus, was, found, guilty, some, jurors, voted, to, acquit, meaning, that, not, everybody, believed, augustus, s, testimony, an, insult, to, the, august, one, the, second, settlement, was, completed, in, part, to, allay, confusion, and, formalize, augustus, s, legal, authority, to, intervene, in, senatorial, provinces, the, senate, granted, augustus, a, form, of, general, imperium, proconsulare, or, proconsular, imperium, power, that, applied, throughout, the, empire, not, solely, to, his, provinces, moreover, the, senate, augmented, augustus, s, proconsular, imperium, into, imperium, proconsulare, maius, or, proconsular, imperium, applicable, throughout, the, empire, that, was, more, maius, or, greater, than, that, held, by, the, other, proconsuls, this, in, effect, gave, augustus, constitutional, power, superior, to, all, other, proconsuls, in, the, empire, augustus, stayed, in, rome, during, the, renewal, process, and, provided, veterans, with, lavish, donations, to, gain, their, support, thereby, ensuring, that, his, status, of, proconsular, imperium, maius, was, renewed, in, 13, bc, during, the, second, settlement, augustus, was, also, granted, the, power, of, a, tribune, tribunicia, potestas, for, life, though, not, the, official, title, of, tribune, for, some, years, augustus, had, been, awarded, tribunicia, sacrosanctitas, the, immunity, given, to, a, tribune, of, the, plebs, now, he, decided, to, assume, the, full, powers, of, the, magistracy, renewed, annually, in, perpetuity, legally, it, was, closed, to, patricians, a, status, that, augustus, had, acquired, some, years, earlier, when, adopted, by, julius, caesar, this, power, allowed, him, to, convene, the, senate, and, people, at, will, and, lay, business, before, them, to, veto, the, actions, of, either, the, assembly, or, the, senate, to, preside, over, elections, and, to, speak, first, at, any, meeting, also, included, in, augustus, s, tribunician, authority, were, powers, usually, reserved, for, the, roman, censor, these, included, the, right, to, supervise, public, morals, and, scrutinize, laws, to, ensure, that, they, were, in, the, public, interest, as, well, as, the, ability, to, hold, a, census, and, determine, the, membership, of, the, senate, with, the, powers, of, a, censor, augustus, appealed, to, virtues, of, roman, patriotism, by, banning, all, attire, but, the, classic, toga, while, entering, the, forum, there, was, no, precedent, within, the, roman, system, for, combining, the, powers, of, the, tribune, and, the, censor, into, a, single, position, nor, was, augustus, ever, elected, to, the, office, of, censor, julius, caesar, had, been, granted, similar, powers, wherein, he, was, charged, with, supervising, the, morals, of, the, state, however, this, position, did, not, extend, to, the, censor, s, ability, to, hold, a, census, and, determine, the, senate, s, roster, the, office, of, the, tribunus, plebis, began, to, lose, its, prestige, due, to, augustus, s, amassing, of, tribunal, powers, so, he, revived, its, importance, by, making, it, a, mandatory, appointment, for, any, plebeian, desiring, the, praetorship, augustus, was, granted, sole, imperium, within, the, city, of, rome, in, addition, to, being, granted, proconsular, imperium, maius, and, tribunician, authority, for, life, traditionally, proconsuls, roman, province, governors, lost, their, proconsular, imperium, when, they, crossed, the, pomerium, the, sacred, boundary, of, rome, and, entered, the, city, in, these, situations, augustus, would, have, power, as, part, of, his, tribunician, authority, but, his, constitutional, imperium, within, the, pomerium, would, be, less, than, that, of, a, serving, consul, which, meant, that, when, he, was, in, the, city, he, might, not, be, the, constitutional, magistrate, with, the, most, authority, thanks, to, his, prestige, or, auctoritas, his, wishes, would, usually, be, obeyed, but, there, might, be, some, difficulty, to, fill, this, power, vacuum, the, senate, voted, that, augustus, s, imperium, proconsulare, maius, superior, proconsular, power, should, not, lapse, when, he, was, inside, the, city, walls, all, armed, forces, in, the, city, had, formerly, been, under, the, control, of, the, urban, praetors, and, consuls, but, this, situation, now, placed, them, under, the, sole, authority, of, augustus, in, addition, the, credit, was, given, to, augustus, for, each, subsequent, roman, military, victory, after, this, time, because, the, majority, of, rome, s, armies, were, stationed, in, imperial, provinces, commanded, by, augustus, through, the, legatus, who, were, deputies, of, the, princeps, in, the, provinces, moreover, if, a, battle, was, fought, in, a, senatorial, province, augustus, s, proconsular, imperium, maius, allowed, him, to, take, command, of, or, credit, for, any, major, military, victory, this, meant, that, augustus, was, the, only, individual, able, to, receive, a, triumph, a, tradition, that, began, with, romulus, rome, s, first, king, and, first, triumphant, general, tiberius, augustus, s, eldest, stepson, by, livia, was, the, only, other, general, to, receive, a, triumph, for, victories, in, germania, in, 7, bc, normally, during, republican, times, the, powers, augustus, held, even, after, the, second, settlement, would, have, been, split, between, several, people, who, would, each, exercise, them, with, the, assistance, of, a, colleague, and, for, a, specific, period, of, time, augustus, held, them, all, at, once, by, himself, and, with, no, time, limits, even, those, that, nominally, had, time, limits, were, automatically, renewed, whenever, they, lapsed, many, of, the, political, subtleties, of, the, second, settlement, seem, to, have, evaded, the, comprehension, of, the, plebeian, class, who, were, augustus, s, greatest, supporters, and, clientele, this, caused, them, to, insist, upon, augustus, s, participation, in, imperial, affairs, from, time, to, time, augustus, failed, to, stand, for, election, as, consul, in, 22, bc, and, fears, arose, once, again, that, he, was, being, forced, from, power, by, the, aristocratic, senate, in, 22, 21, and, 19, bc, the, people, rioted, in, response, and, only, allowed, a, single, consul, to, be, elected, for, each, of, those, years, ostensibly, to, leave, the, other, position, open, for, augustus, likewise, there, was, a, food, shortage, in, rome, in, 22, bc, which, sparked, panic, while, many, urban, plebs, called, for, augustus, to, take, on, dictatorial, powers, to, personally, oversee, the, crisis, after, a, theatrical, display, of, refusal, before, the, senate, augustus, finally, accepted, authority, over, rome, s, grain, supply, by, virtue, of, his, proconsular, imperium, and, ended, the, crisis, almost, immediately, it, was, not, until, ad, 8, that, a, food, crisis, of, this, sort, prompted, augustus, to, establish, a, praefectus, annonae, a, permanent, prefect, who, was, in, charge, of, procuring, food, supplies, for, rome, there, were, some, who, were, concerned, by, the, expansion, of, powers, granted, to, augustus, by, the, second, settlement, and, this, came, to, a, head, with, the, apparent, conspiracy, of, fannius, caepio, some, time, prior, to, 1, september, 22, bc, a, certain, castricius, provided, augustus, with, information, about, a, conspiracy, led, by, fannius, caepio, murena, the, outspoken, consul, who, defended, primus, in, the, marcus, primus, affair, was, named, among, the, conspirators, the, conspirators, were, tried, in, absentia, with, tiberius, acting, as, prosecutor, the, jury, found, them, guilty, but, it, was, not, a, unanimous, verdict, all, the, accused, were, sentenced, to, death, for, treason, and, executed, as, soon, as, they, were, captured, without, ever, giving, testimony, in, their, defence, augustus, ensured, that, the, fa, ade, of, republican, government, continued, with, an, effective, cover, up, of, the, events, in, 19, bc, the, senate, granted, augustus, a, form, of, general, consular, imperium, which, was, probably, imperium, consulare, maius, like, the, proconsular, powers, that, he, received, in, 23, bc, like, his, tribune, authority, the, consular, powers, were, another, instance, of, gaining, power, from, offices, that, he, did, not, actually, hold, in, addition, augustus, was, allowed, to, wear, the, consul, s, insignia, in, public, and, before, the, senate, as, well, as, to, sit, in, the, symbolic, chair, between, the, two, consuls, and, hold, the, fasces, an, emblem, of, consular, authority, this, seems, to, have, assuaged, the, populace, regardless, of, whether, or, not, augustus, was, a, consul, the, importance, was, that, he, both, appeared, as, one, before, the, people, and, could, exercise, consular, power, if, necessary, on, 6, march, 12, bc, after, the, death, of, lepidus, he, additionally, took, up, the, position, of, pontifex, maximus, the, high, priest, of, the, college, of, the, pontiffs, the, most, important, position, in, roman, religion, on, 5, february, 2, bc, augustus, was, also, given, the, title, pater, patriae, or, father, of, the, country, a, final, reason, for, the, second, settlement, was, to, give, the, principate, constitutional, stability, and, staying, power, in, case, something, happened, to, princeps, augustus, his, illness, of, early, 23, bc, and, the, caepio, conspiracy, showed, that, the, regime, s, existence, hung, by, the, thin, thread, of, the, life, of, one, man, augustus, himself, who, had, several, severe, and, dangerous, illnesses, throughout, his, life, if, he, were, to, die, from, natural, causes, or, fall, victim, to, assassination, rome, could, be, subjected, to, another, round, of, civil, war, the, memories, of, pharsalus, the, ides, of, march, the, proscriptions, philippi, and, actium, barely, twenty, five, years, distant, were, still, vivid, in, the, minds, of, many, citizens, proconsular, imperium, was, conferred, upon, agrippa, for, five, years, similar, to, augustus, s, power, in, order, to, accomplish, this, constitutional, stability, the, exact, nature, of, the, grant, is, uncertain, but, it, probably, covered, augustus, s, imperial, provinces, east, and, west, perhaps, lacking, authority, over, the, provinces, of, the, senate, that, came, later, as, did, the, jealously, guarded, tribunicia, potestas, augustus, s, accumulation, of, powers, was, now, complete, by, ad, 13, augustus, boasted, 21, occasions, where, his, troops, proclaimed, him, imperator, after, a, successful, battle, almost, the, entire, fourth, chapter, in, his, publicly, released, memoirs, of, achievements, known, as, the, res, gestae, is, devoted, to, his, military, victories, and, honors, augustus, also, promoted, the, ideal, of, a, superior, roman, civilization, with, a, task, of, ruling, the, world, to, the, extent, to, which, the, romans, knew, it, a, sentiment, embodied, in, words, that, the, contemporary, poet, virgil, attributes, to, a, legendary, ancestor, of, augustus, tu, regere, imperio, populos, romane, memento, roman, remember, to, rule, the, earth, s, peoples, with, authority, the, impulse, for, expansionism, was, apparently, prominent, among, all, classes, at, rome, and, it, is, accorded, divine, sanction, by, virgil, s, jupiter, in, book, 1, of, the, aeneid, where, jupiter, promises, rome, imperium, sine, fine, sovereignty, without, end, by, the, end, of, his, reign, the, armies, of, augustus, had, conquered, northern, hispania, modern, spain, and, portugal, and, the, alpine, regions, of, raetia, and, noricum, modern, switzerland, bavaria, austria, slovenia, illyricum, and, pannonia, modern, albania, croatia, hungary, serbia, etc, and, had, extended, the, borders, of, africa, proconsularis, to, the, east, and, south, judea, was, added, to, the, province, of, syria, when, augustus, deposed, herod, archelaus, successor, to, client, king, herod, the, great, syria, like, egypt, after, antony, was, governed, by, a, high, prefect, of, the, equestrian, class, rather, than, by, a, proconsul, or, legate, of, augustus, again, no, military, effort, was, needed, in, 25, bc, when, galatia, part, of, modern, turkey, was, converted, to, a, roman, province, shortly, after, amyntas, of, galatia, was, killed, by, an, avenging, widow, of, a, slain, prince, from, homonada, the, rebellious, tribes, of, asturias, and, cantabria, in, modern, day, spain, were, finally, quelled, in, 19, bc, and, the, territory, fell, under, the, provinces, of, hispania, and, lusitania, this, region, proved, to, be, a, major, asset, in, funding, augustus, s, future, military, campaigns, as, it, was, rich, in, mineral, deposits, that, could, be, fostered, in, roman, mining, projects, especially, the, very, rich, gold, deposits, at, las, m, dulas, conquering, the, peoples, of, the, alps, in, 16, bc, was, another, important, victory, for, rome, since, it, provided, a, large, territorial, buffer, between, the, roman, citizens, of, italy, and, rome, s, enemies, in, germania, to, the, north, horace, dedicated, an, ode, to, the, victory, while, the, monumental, trophy, of, augustus, near, monaco, was, built, to, honor, the, occasion, the, capture, of, the, alpine, region, also, served, the, next, offensive, in, 12, bc, when, tiberius, began, the, offensive, against, the, pannonian, tribes, of, illyricum, and, his, brother, nero, claudius, drusus, moved, against, the, germanic, tribes, of, the, eastern, rhineland, both, campaigns, were, successful, as, drusus, s, forces, reached, the, elbe, river, by, 9, bc, though, he, died, shortly, after, by, falling, off, his, horse, it, was, recorded, that, the, pious, tiberius, walked, in, front, of, his, brother, s, body, all, the, way, back, to, rome, to, protect, rome, s, eastern, territories, from, the, parthian, empire, augustus, relied, on, the, client, states, of, the, east, to, act, as, territorial, buffers, and, areas, that, could, raise, their, own, troops, for, defense, to, ensure, security, of, the, empire, s, eastern, flank, augustus, stationed, a, roman, army, in, syria, while, his, skilled, stepson, tiberius, negotiated, with, the, parthians, as, rome, s, diplomat, to, the, east, tiberius, was, responsible, for, restoring, tigranes, v, to, the, throne, of, the, kingdom, of, armenia, arguably, his, greatest, diplomatic, achievement, was, negotiating, with, phraates, iv, of, parthia, 37, 2, bc, in, 20, bc, for, the, return, of, the, battle, standards, lost, by, crassus, in, the, battle, of, carrhae, a, symbolic, victory, and, great, boost, of, morale, for, rome, werner, eck, claims, that, this, was, a, great, disappointment, for, romans, seeking, to, avenge, crassus, s, defeat, by, military, means, however, maria, brosius, explains, that, augustus, used, the, return, of, the, standards, as, propaganda, symbolizing, the, submission, of, parthia, to, rome, the, event, was, celebrated, in, art, such, as, the, breastplate, design, on, the, statue, augustus, of, prima, porta, and, in, monuments, such, as, the, temple, of, mars, ultor, mars, the, avenger, built, to, house, the, standards, parthia, had, always, posed, a, threat, to, rome, in, the, east, but, the, real, battlefront, was, along, the, rhine, and, danube, rivers, before, the, final, fight, with, antony, octavian, s, campaigns, against, the, tribes, in, dalmatia, were, the, first, step, in, expanding, roman, dominions, to, the, danube, victory, in, battle, was, not, always, a, permanent, success, as, newly, conquered, territories, were, constantly, retaken, by, rome, s, enemies, in, germania, a, prime, example, of, roman, loss, in, battle, was, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, in, ad, 9, where, three, entire, legions, led, by, publius, quinctilius, varus, were, destroyed, by, arminius, leader, of, the, cherusci, an, apparent, roman, ally, augustus, retaliated, by, dispatching, tiberius, and, drusus, to, the, rhineland, to, pacify, it, which, had, some, success, although, the, battle, brought, the, end, to, roman, expansion, into, germany, the, roman, general, germanicus, took, advantage, of, a, cherusci, civil, war, between, arminius, and, segestes, at, the, battle, of, idistaviso, in, ad, 16, he, defeated, arminius, the, illness, of, augustus, in, 23, bc, brought, the, problem, of, succession, to, the, forefront, of, political, issues, and, the, public, to, ensure, stability, he, needed, to, designate, an, heir, to, his, unique, position, in, roman, society, and, government, this, was, to, be, achieved, in, small, undramatic, and, incremental, ways, that, did, not, stir, senatorial, fears, of, monarchy, if, someone, was, to, succeed, to, augustus, s, unofficial, position, of, power, he, would, have, to, earn, it, through, his, own, publicly, proven, merits, some, augustan, historians, argue, that, indications, pointed, toward, his, sister, s, son, marcellus, who, had, been, quickly, married, to, augustus, s, daughter, julia, the, elder, other, historians, dispute, this, since, augustus, s, will, was, read, aloud, to, the, senate, while, he, was, seriously, ill, in, 23, bc, indicating, a, preference, for, marcus, agrippa, who, was, augustus, s, second, in, charge, and, arguably, the, only, one, of, his, associates, who, could, have, controlled, the, legions, and, held, the, empire, together, after, the, death, of, marcellus, in, 23, bc, augustus, married, his, daughter, to, agrippa, this, union, produced, five, children, three, sons, and, two, daughters, gaius, caesar, lucius, caesar, vipsania, julia, agrippina, and, agrippa, postumus, so, named, because, he, was, born, after, marcus, agrippa, died, shortly, after, the, second, settlement, agrippa, was, granted, a, five, year, term, of, administering, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, with, the, imperium, of, a, proconsul, and, the, same, tribunicia, potestas, granted, to, augustus, although, not, trumping, augustus, s, authority, his, seat, of, governance, stationed, at, samos, in, the, eastern, aegean, this, granting, of, power, showed, augustus, s, favor, for, agrippa, but, it, was, also, a, measure, to, please, members, of, his, caesarian, party, by, allowing, one, of, their, members, to, share, a, considerable, amount, of, power, with, him, augustus, s, intent, became, apparent, to, make, his, grandsons, gaius, and, lucius, his, heirs, when, he, adopted, them, as, his, own, children, he, took, the, consulship, in, 5, and, 2, bc, so, that, he, could, personally, usher, them, into, their, political, careers, and, they, were, nominated, for, the, consulships, of, ad, 1, and, 4, augustus, also, showed, favor, to, his, stepsons, livia, s, children, from, her, first, marriage, nero, claudius, drusus, germanicus, henceforth, referred, to, as, drusus, and, tiberius, claudius, henceforth, tiberius, granting, them, military, commands, and, public, office, though, seeming, to, favor, drusus, after, agrippa, died, in, 12, bc, tiberius, was, ordered, to, divorce, his, own, wife, vipsania, agrippina, and, marry, augustus, s, widowed, daughter, julia, as, soon, as, a, period, of, mourning, for, agrippa, had, ended, drusus, s, marriage, to, augustus, s, niece, antonia, was, considered, an, unbreakable, affair, whereas, vipsania, was, only, the, daughter, of, the, late, agrippa, from, his, first, marriage, tiberius, shared, in, augustus, s, tribune, powers, as, of, 6, bc, but, shortly, thereafter, went, into, retirement, reportedly, wanting, no, further, role, in, politics, while, he, exiled, himself, to, rhodes, no, specific, reason, is, known, for, his, departure, though, it, could, have, been, a, combination, of, reasons, including, a, failing, marriage, with, julia, as, well, as, a, sense, of, envy, and, exclusion, over, augustus, s, apparent, favouring, of, the, younger, gaius, and, lucius, gaius, and, lucius, joined, the, college, of, priests, at, an, early, age, were, presented, to, spectators, in, a, more, favorable, light, and, were, introduced, to, the, army, in, gaul, after, the, deaths, of, both, lucius, and, gaius, in, ad, 2, and, 4, respectively, and, the, earlier, death, of, his, brother, drusus, 9, bc, tiberius, was, recalled, to, rome, in, june, ad, 4, where, he, was, adopted, by, augustus, on, the, condition, that, he, in, turn, adopt, his, nephew, germanicus, this, continued, the, tradition, of, presenting, at, least, two, generations, of, heirs, in, that, year, tiberius, was, also, granted, the, powers, of, a, tribune, and, proconsul, emissaries, from, foreign, kings, had, to, pay, their, respects, to, him, and, by, ad, 13, was, awarded, with, his, second, triumph, and, equal, level, of, imperium, with, that, of, augustus, the, only, other, possible, claimant, as, heir, was, agrippa, postumus, who, had, been, exiled, by, augustus, in, ad, 7, his, banishment, made, permanent, by, senatorial, decree, and, augustus, officially, disowned, him, he, certainly, fell, out, of, augustus, s, favor, as, an, heir, the, historian, erich, s, gruen, notes, various, contemporary, sources, that, state, agrippa, postumus, was, a, vulgar, young, man, brutal, and, brutish, and, of, depraved, character, on, 19, august, ad, 14, augustus, died, while, visiting, nola, where, his, father, had, died, both, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, wrote, that, livia, was, rumored, to, have, brought, about, augustus, s, death, by, poisoning, fresh, figs, this, element, features, in, many, modern, works, of, historical, fiction, pertaining, to, augustus, s, life, but, some, historians, view, it, as, likely, to, have, been, a, salacious, fabrication, made, by, those, who, had, favoured, postumus, as, heir, or, other, political, enemies, of, tiberius, livia, had, long, been, the, target, of, similar, rumors, of, poisoning, on, the, behalf, of, her, son, most, or, all, of, which, are, unlikely, to, have, been, true, alternatively, it, is, possible, that, livia, did, supply, a, poisoned, fig, she, did, cultivate, a, variety, of, fig, named, for, her, that, augustus, is, said, to, have, enjoyed, but, did, so, as, a, means, of, assisted, suicide, rather, than, murder, augustus, s, health, had, been, in, decline, in, the, months, immediately, before, his, death, and, he, had, made, significant, preparations, for, a, smooth, transition, in, power, having, at, last, reluctantly, settled, on, tiberius, as, his, choice, of, heir, it, is, likely, that, augustus, was, not, expected, to, return, alive, from, nola, but, it, seems, that, his, health, improved, once, there, it, has, therefore, been, speculated, that, augustus, and, livia, conspired, to, end, his, life, at, the, anticipated, time, having, committed, all, political, process, to, accepting, tiberius, in, order, to, not, endanger, that, transition, augustus, s, famous, last, words, were, have, i, played, the, part, well, then, applaud, as, i, exit, acta, est, fabula, plaudite, referring, to, the, play, acting, and, regal, authority, that, he, had, put, on, as, emperor, an, enormous, funerary, procession, of, mourners, traveled, with, augustus, s, body, from, nola, to, rome, and, all, public, and, private, businesses, closed, on, the, day, of, his, burial, tiberius, and, his, son, drusus, delivered, the, eulogy, while, standing, atop, two, rostra, augustus, s, body, was, coffin, bound, and, cremated, on, a, pyre, close, to, his, mausoleum, it, was, proclaimed, that, augustus, joined, the, company, of, the, gods, as, a, member, of, the, roman, pantheon, historian, d, c, a, shotter, states, that, augustus, s, policy, of, favoring, the, julian, family, line, over, the, claudian, might, have, afforded, tiberius, sufficient, cause, to, show, open, disdain, for, augustus, after, the, latter, s, death, instead, tiberius, was, always, quick, to, rebuke, those, who, criticized, augustus, shotter, suggests, that, augustus, s, deification, obliged, tiberius, to, suppress, any, open, resentment, that, he, might, have, harbored, coupled, with, tiberius, s, extremely, conservative, attitude, towards, religion, also, historian, r, shaw, smith, points, to, letters, of, augustus, to, tiberius, which, display, affection, towards, tiberius, and, high, regard, for, his, military, merits, shotter, states, that, tiberius, focused, his, anger, and, criticism, on, gaius, asinius, gallus, for, marrying, vipsania, after, augustus, forced, tiberius, to, divorce, her, as, well, as, toward, the, two, young, caesars, gaius, and, lucius, instead, of, augustus, the, real, architect, of, his, divorce, and, imperial, demotion, augustus, created, a, regime, which, maintained, peace, and, prosperity, in, the, roman, west, and, the, greek, east, for, two, centuries, its, dominance, also, laid, the, foundations, of, a, concept, of, universal, empire, in, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, holy, roman, empires, down, to, their, dissolutions, in, 1453, and, 1806, respectively, both, his, adoptive, surname, caesar, and, his, title, augustus, became, the, permanent, titles, of, the, rulers, of, the, roman, empire, for, fourteen, centuries, after, his, death, in, use, both, at, old, rome, and, at, new, rome, in, many, languages, caesar, became, the, word, for, emperor, as, in, the, german, kaiser, and, in, the, bulgarian, and, subsequently, russian, tsar, sometimes, csar, or, czar, the, cult, of, divus, augustus, continued, until, the, state, religion, of, the, empire, was, changed, to, christianity, in, 391, by, theodosius, i, consequently, there, are, many, statues, and, busts, of, the, first, emperor, he, had, composed, an, account, of, his, achievements, the, res, gestae, divi, augusti, to, be, inscribed, in, bronze, in, front, of, his, mausoleum, copies, of, the, text, were, inscribed, throughout, the, empire, upon, his, death, the, inscriptions, in, latin, featured, translations, in, greek, beside, it, and, were, inscribed, on, many, public, edifices, such, as, the, temple, in, ankara, dubbed, the, monumentum, ancyranum, called, the, queen, of, inscriptions, by, historian, theodor, mommsen, the, res, gestae, is, the, only, work, to, have, survived, from, antiquity, though, augustus, is, also, known, to, have, composed, poems, entitled, sicily, epiphanus, and, ajax, an, autobiography, of, 13, books, a, philosophical, treatise, and, a, written, rebuttal, to, brutus, s, eulogy, of, cato, historians, are, able, to, analyze, excerpts, of, letters, penned, by, augustus, preserved, in, other, works, to, others, for, additional, facts, or, clues, about, his, personal, life, many, consider, augustus, to, be, rome, s, greatest, emperor, his, policies, certainly, extended, the, empire, s, life, span, and, initiated, the, celebrated, pax, romana, or, pax, augusta, the, roman, senate, wished, subsequent, emperors, to, be, more, fortunate, than, augustus, and, better, than, trajan, augustus, was, intelligent, decisive, and, a, shrewd, politician, but, he, was, not, perhaps, as, charismatic, as, julius, caesar, and, was, influenced, on, occasion, by, livia, sometimes, for, the, worse, nevertheless, his, legacy, proved, more, enduring, the, city, of, rome, was, utterly, transformed, under, augustus, with, rome, s, first, institutionalized, police, force, firefighting, force, and, the, establishment, of, the, municipal, prefect, as, a, permanent, office, the, police, force, was, divided, into, cohorts, of, 500, men, each, while, the, units, of, firemen, ranged, from, 500, to, 1, 000, men, each, with, 7, units, assigned, to, 14, divided, city, sectors, a, praefectus, vigilum, or, prefect, of, the, watch, was, put, in, charge, of, the, vigiles, rome, s, fire, brigade, and, police, with, rome, s, civil, wars, at, an, end, augustus, was, also, able, to, create, a, standing, army, for, the, roman, empire, fixed, at, a, size, of, 28, legions, of, about, 170, 000, soldiers, this, was, supported, by, numerous, auxiliary, units, of, 500, non, citizen, soldiers, each, often, recruited, from, recently, conquered, areas, with, his, finances, securing, the, maintenance, of, roads, throughout, italy, augustus, installed, an, official, courier, system, of, relay, stations, overseen, by, a, military, officer, known, as, the, praefectus, vehiculorum, besides, the, advent, of, swifter, communication, among, italian, polities, his, extensive, building, of, roads, throughout, italy, also, allowed, rome, s, armies, to, march, swiftly, and, at, an, unprecedented, pace, across, the, country, in, the, year, 6, augustus, established, the, aerarium, militare, donating, 170, million, sesterces, to, the, new, military, treasury, that, provided, for, both, active, and, retired, soldiers, one, of, the, most, enduring, institutions, of, augustus, was, the, establishment, of, the, praetorian, guard, in, 27, bc, originally, a, personal, bodyguard, unit, on, the, battlefield, that, evolved, into, an, imperial, guard, as, well, as, an, important, political, force, in, rome, they, had, the, power, to, intimidate, the, senate, install, new, emperors, and, depose, ones, they, disliked, the, last, emperor, they, served, was, maxentius, as, it, was, constantine, i, who, disbanded, them, in, the, early, 4th, century, and, destroyed, their, barracks, the, castra, praetoria, although, the, most, powerful, individual, in, the, roman, empire, augustus, wished, to, embody, the, spirit, of, republican, virtue, and, norms, he, also, wanted, to, relate, to, and, connect, with, the, concerns, of, the, plebs, and, lay, people, he, achieved, this, through, various, means, of, generosity, and, a, cutting, back, of, lavish, excess, in, the, year, 29, bc, augustus, gave, 400, sesterces, equal, to, 1, 10, of, a, roman, pound, of, gold, each, to, 250, 000, citizens, 1, 000, sesterces, each, to, 120, 000, veterans, in, the, colonies, and, spent, 700, million, sesterces, in, purchasing, land, for, his, soldiers, to, settle, upon, he, also, restored, 82, different, temples, to, display, his, care, for, the, roman, pantheon, of, deities, in, 28, bc, he, melted, down, 80, silver, statues, erected, in, his, likeness, and, in, honor, of, him, an, attempt, of, his, to, appear, frugal, and, modest, the, longevity, of, augustus, s, reign, and, its, legacy, to, the, roman, world, should, not, be, overlooked, as, a, key, factor, in, its, success, as, tacitus, wrote, the, younger, generations, alive, in, ad, 14, had, never, known, any, form, of, government, other, than, the, principate, had, augustus, died, earlier, matters, might, have, turned, out, differently, the, attrition, of, the, civil, wars, on, the, old, republican, oligarchy, and, the, longevity, of, augustus, therefore, must, be, seen, as, major, contributing, factors, in, the, transformation, of, the, roman, state, into, a, de, facto, monarchy, in, these, years, augustus, s, own, experience, his, patience, his, tact, and, his, political, acumen, also, played, their, parts, he, directed, the, future, of, the, empire, down, many, lasting, paths, from, the, existence, of, a, standing, professional, army, stationed, at, or, near, the, frontiers, to, the, dynastic, principle, so, often, employed, in, the, imperial, succession, to, the, embellishment, of, the, capital, at, the, emperor, s, expense, augustus, s, ultimate, legacy, was, the, peace, and, prosperity, the, empire, enjoyed, for, the, next, two, centuries, under, the, system, he, initiated, his, memory, was, enshrined, in, the, political, ethos, of, the, imperial, age, as, a, paradigm, of, the, good, emperor, every, emperor, of, rome, adopted, his, name, caesar, augustus, which, gradually, lost, its, character, as, a, name, and, eventually, became, a, title, the, augustan, era, poets, virgil, and, horace, praised, augustus, as, a, defender, of, rome, an, upholder, of, moral, justice, and, an, individual, who, bore, the, brunt, of, responsibility, in, maintaining, the, empire, however, for, his, rule, of, rome, and, establishing, the, principate, augustus, has, also, been, subjected, to, criticism, throughout, the, ages, the, contemporary, roman, jurist, marcus, antistius, labeo, fond, of, the, days, of, pre, augustan, republican, liberty, in, which, he, had, been, born, openly, criticized, the, augustan, regime, in, the, beginning, of, his, annals, tacitus, wrote, that, augustus, had, cunningly, subverted, republican, rome, into, a, position, of, slavery, he, continued, to, say, that, with, augustus, s, death, and, swearing, of, loyalty, to, tiberius, the, people, of, rome, traded, one, slaveholder, for, another, in, a, 2006, biography, on, augustus, anthony, everitt, asserts, that, through, the, centuries, judgments, on, augustus, s, reign, have, oscillated, between, these, two, extremes, tacitus, was, of, the, belief, that, nerva, r, 96, 98, successfully, mingled, two, formerly, alien, ideas, principate, and, liberty, the, 3rd, century, historian, cassius, dio, acknowledged, augustus, as, a, benign, moderate, ruler, yet, like, most, other, historians, after, the, death, of, augustus, dio, viewed, augustus, as, an, autocrat, the, poet, marcus, annaeus, lucanus, ad, 39, 65, was, of, the, opinion, that, caesar, s, victory, over, pompey, and, the, fall, of, cato, the, younger, 95, bc, 46, bc, marked, the, end, of, traditional, liberty, in, rome, historian, chester, starr, writes, of, his, avoidance, of, criticizing, augustus, perhaps, augustus, was, too, sacred, a, figure, to, accuse, directly, the, anglo, irish, writer, jonathan, swift, 1667, 1745, in, his, discourse, on, the, contests, and, dissentions, in, athens, and, rome, criticized, augustus, for, installing, tyranny, over, rome, and, likened, what, he, believed, great, britain, s, virtuous, constitutional, monarchy, to, rome, s, moral, republic, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, in, his, criticism, of, augustus, the, admiral, and, historian, thomas, gordon, 1658, 1741, compared, augustus, to, the, puritanical, tyrant, oliver, cromwell, 1599, 1658, thomas, gordon, and, the, french, political, philosopher, montesquieu, 1689, 1755, both, remarked, that, augustus, was, a, coward, in, battle, in, his, memoirs, of, the, court, of, augustus, the, scottish, scholar, thomas, blackwell, 1701, 1757, deemed, augustus, a, machiavellian, ruler, a, bloodthirsty, vindicative, usurper, wicked, and, worthless, a, mean, spirit, and, a, tyrant, augustus, s, public, revenue, reforms, had, a, great, impact, on, the, subsequent, success, of, the, empire, augustus, brought, a, far, greater, portion, of, the, empire, s, expanded, land, base, under, consistent, direct, taxation, from, rome, instead, of, exacting, varying, intermittent, and, somewhat, arbitrary, tributes, from, each, local, province, as, augustus, s, predecessors, had, done, this, reform, greatly, increased, rome, s, net, revenue, from, its, territorial, acquisitions, stabilized, its, flow, and, regularized, the, financial, relationship, between, rome, and, the, provinces, rather, than, provoking, fresh, resentments, with, each, new, arbitrary, exaction, of, tribute, the, measures, of, taxation, in, the, reign, of, augustus, were, determined, by, population, census, with, fixed, quotas, for, each, province, citizens, of, rome, and, italy, paid, indirect, taxes, while, direct, taxes, were, exacted, from, the, provinces, indirect, taxes, included, a, 4, tax, on, the, price, of, slaves, a, 1, tax, on, goods, sold, at, auction, and, a, 5, tax, on, the, inheritance, of, estates, valued, at, over, 100, 000, sesterces, by, persons, other, than, the, next, of, kin, an, equally, important, reform, was, the, abolition, of, private, tax, farming, which, was, replaced, by, salaried, civil, service, tax, collectors, private, contractors, who, collected, taxes, for, the, state, were, the, norm, in, the, republican, era, some, of, them, were, powerful, enough, to, influence, the, number, of, votes, for, men, running, for, offices, in, rome, these, tax, farmers, called, publicans, were, infamous, for, their, depredations, great, private, wealth, and, the, right, to, tax, local, areas, the, use, of, egypt, s, immense, land, rents, to, finance, the, empire, s, operations, resulted, from, augustus, s, conquest, of, egypt, and, the, shift, to, a, roman, form, of, government, as, it, was, effectively, considered, augustus, s, private, property, rather, than, a, province, of, the, empire, it, became, part, of, each, succeeding, emperor, s, patrimonium, instead, of, a, legate, or, proconsul, augustus, installed, a, prefect, from, the, equestrian, class, to, administer, egypt, and, maintain, its, lucrative, seaports, this, position, became, the, highest, political, achievement, for, any, equestrian, besides, becoming, prefect, of, the, praetorian, guard, the, highly, productive, agricultural, land, of, egypt, yielded, enormous, revenues, that, were, available, to, augustus, and, his, successors, to, pay, for, public, works, and, military, expeditions, the, month, of, august, latin, augustus, is, named, after, augustus, until, his, time, it, was, called, sextilis, named, so, because, it, had, been, the, sixth, month, of, the, original, roman, calendar, and, the, latin, word, for, six, is, sex, commonly, repeated, lore, has, it, that, august, has, 31, days, because, augustus, wanted, his, month, to, match, the, length, of, julius, caesar, s, july, but, this, is, an, invention, of, the, 13th, century, scholar, johannes, de, sacrobosco, sextilis, in, fact, had, 31, days, before, it, was, renamed, and, it, was, not, chosen, for, its, length, see, julian, calendar, according, to, a, senatus, consultum, quoted, by, macrobius, sextilis, was, renamed, to, honor, augustus, because, several, of, the, most, significant, events, in, his, rise, to, power, culminating, in, the, fall, of, alexandria, fell, in, that, month, roman, italy, was, established, by, augustus, in, 7, bc, with, the, latin, name, italia, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, italian, peninsula, was, united, administratively, and, politically, under, the, same, name, due, to, this, act, augustus, was, called, the, father, of, italy, by, italian, historians, such, as, g, giannelli, on, his, deathbed, augustus, boasted, i, found, a, rome, of, bricks, i, leave, to, you, one, of, marble, although, there, is, some, truth, in, the, literal, meaning, of, this, cassius, dio, asserts, that, it, was, a, metaphor, for, the, empire, s, strength, marble, could, be, found, in, buildings, of, rome, before, augustus, but, it, was, not, extensively, used, as, a, building, material, until, the, reign, of, augustus, although, this, did, not, apply, to, the, subura, slums, which, were, still, as, rickety, and, fire, prone, as, ever, he, did, leave, a, mark, on, the, monumental, topography, of, the, centre, and, of, the, campus, martius, with, the, ara, pacis, altar, of, peace, and, monumental, sundial, whose, central, gnomon, was, an, obelisk, taken, from, egypt, the, relief, sculptures, decorating, the, ara, pacis, visually, augmented, the, written, record, of, augustus, s, triumphs, in, the, res, gestae, its, reliefs, depicted, the, imperial, pageants, of, the, praetorians, the, vestals, and, the, citizenry, of, rome, he, also, built, the, temple, of, caesar, the, temple, of, jupiter, tonans, the, temple, of, apollo, palatinus, and, the, baths, of, agrippa, and, the, forum, of, augustus, with, its, temple, of, mars, ultor, other, projects, were, either, encouraged, by, him, such, as, the, theatre, of, balbus, and, agrippa, s, construction, of, the, pantheon, or, funded, by, him, in, the, name, of, others, often, relations, e, g, portico, of, octavia, theatre, of, marcellus, even, his, mausoleum, of, augustus, was, built, before, his, death, to, house, members, of, his, family, to, celebrate, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, actium, the, arch, of, augustus, was, built, in, 29, bc, near, the, entrance, of, the, temple, of, castor, and, pollux, and, widened, in, 19, bc, to, include, a, triple, arch, design, after, the, death, of, agrippa, in, 12, bc, a, solution, had, to, be, found, in, maintaining, rome, s, water, supply, system, this, came, about, because, it, was, overseen, by, agrippa, when, he, served, as, aedile, and, was, even, funded, by, him, afterwards, when, he, was, a, private, citizen, paying, at, his, own, expense, in, that, year, augustus, arranged, a, system, where, the, senate, designated, three, of, its, members, as, prime, commissioners, in, charge, of, the, water, supply, and, to, ensure, that, rome, s, aqueducts, did, not, fall, into, disrepair, in, the, late, augustan, era, the, commission, of, five, senators, called, the, curatores, locorum, publicorum, iudicandorum, translated, as, supervisors, of, public, property, was, put, in, charge, of, maintaining, public, buildings, and, temples, of, the, state, cult, augustus, created, the, senatorial, group, of, the, curatores, viarum, translated, as, supervisors, for, roads, for, the, upkeep, of, roads, this, senatorial, commission, worked, with, local, officials, and, contractors, to, organize, regular, repairs, the, corinthian, order, of, architectural, style, originating, from, ancient, greece, was, the, dominant, architectural, style, in, the, age, of, augustus, and, the, imperial, phase, of, rome, suetonius, once, commented, that, rome, was, unworthy, of, its, status, as, an, imperial, capital, yet, augustus, and, agrippa, set, out, to, dismantle, this, sentiment, by, transforming, the, appearance, of, rome, upon, the, classical, greek, model, the, official, residence, of, augustus, was, the, domus, augusti, on, the, palatine, which, he, made, into, a, palace, after, buying, it, in, 41, 40, bc, he, had, other, residences, such, as, the, horti, maecenati, in, rome, where, augustus, preferred, to, stay, whenever, he, became, ill, and, which, maecenas, left, to, him, in, his, will, in, 8, bc, the, great, villa, of, vedius, pollio, at, posilipo, near, naples, was, beqeathed, probably, forced, to, him, in, 15, bc, augustus, built, the, palazzo, a, mare, palace, on, capri, he, also, built, the, immense, villa, giulia, on, the, island, of, ventotene, as, a, summer, residence, early, in, his, reign, the, family, home, of, augustus, was, probably, the, villa, at, somma, vesuviana, nola, this, was, the, location, where, he, died, and, where, his, father, also, died, his, biographer, suetonius, writing, about, a, century, after, augustus, s, death, described, his, appearance, as, unusually, handsome, and, exceedingly, graceful, at, all, periods, of, his, life, though, he, cared, nothing, for, personal, adornment, he, was, so, far, from, being, particular, about, the, dressing, of, his, hair, that, he, would, have, several, barbers, working, in, a, hurry, at, the, same, time, and, as, for, his, beard, he, now, had, it, clipped, and, now, shaved, while, at, the, very, same, time, he, would, either, be, reading, or, writing, something, he, had, clear, bright, eyes, his, teeth, were, wide, apart, small, and, ill, kept, his, hair, was, slightly, curly, and, inclined, to, golden, his, eyebrows, met, his, ears, were, of, moderate, size, and, his, nose, projected, a, little, at, the, top, and, then, bent, ever, so, slightly, inward, his, complexion, was, between, dark, and, fair, he, was, short, of, stature, although, julius, marathus, his, freedman, and, keeper, of, his, records, says, that, he, was, five, feet, and, nine, inches, just, under, 5, ft, 7, in, or, 1, 70, meters, in, modern, height, measurements, but, this, was, concealed, by, the, fine, proportion, and, symmetry, of, his, figure, and, was, noticeable, only, by, comparison, with, some, taller, person, standing, beside, him, adding, that, his, shoes, somewhat, high, soled, to, make, him, look, taller, than, he, really, was, scientific, analysis, of, traces, of, paint, found, in, his, official, statues, shows, that, he, most, likely, had, light, brown, hair, his, official, images, were, very, tightly, controlled, and, idealized, drawing, from, a, tradition, of, hellenistic, portraiture, rather, than, the, tradition, of, realism, in, roman, portraiture, he, first, appeared, on, coins, at, the, age, of, 19, and, from, about, 29, bc, the, explosion, in, the, number, of, augustan, portraits, attests, a, concerted, propaganda, campaign, aimed, at, dominating, all, aspects, of, civil, religious, economic, and, military, life, with, augustus, s, person, the, early, images, did, indeed, depict, a, young, man, but, although, there, were, gradual, changes, his, images, remained, youthful, until, he, died, in, his, seventies, by, which, time, they, had, a, distanced, air, of, ageless, majesty, according, to, the, classicist, r, r, r, smith, among, the, best, known, of, many, surviving, portraits, are, the, augustus, of, prima, porta, the, image, on, the, ara, pacis, and, the, via, labicana, augustus, which, depicts, him, in, his, role, as, pontifex, maximus, several, cameo, portraits, include, the, blacas, cameo, and, gemma, augustea
