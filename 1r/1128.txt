polish, wi, tope, k, greek, sfendopl, kos, was, a, ruler, of, great, moravia, which, attained, its, maximum, territorial, expansion, during, his, reign, 870, 871, 871, 894, svatopluk, s, career, started, in, the, 860s, when, he, governed, a, principality, within, moravia, the, location, of, which, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, among, historians, under, the, suzerainty, of, his, uncle, rastislav, in, 870, svatopluk, dethroned, rastislav, who, was, a, vassal, of, louis, the, german, and, betrayed, him, to, the, franks, within, a, year, however, the, franks, also, imprisoned, svatopluk, after, the, moravians, rebelled, against, the, franks, svatopluk, was, released, and, led, the, rebels, to, victory, over, the, invaders, although, he, was, obliged, to, pay, tribute, to, east, francia, under, the, peace, treaty, concluded, at, forchheim, germany, in, 874, he, was, able, to, expand, his, territories, outside, the, franks, sphere, of, interest, in, the, following, years, his, forces, even, invaded, the, march, of, pannonia, within, east, francia, in, 882, svatopluk, established, a, good, relationship, with, the, popes, and, he, and, his, people, were, formally, taken, under, the, protection, of, the, holy, see, in, 880, pope, stephen, v, even, addressed, him, as, king, in, a, letter, written, in, 885, svatopluk, seems, to, have, wanted, to, appease, the, german, clergy, who, opposed, the, conducting, of, the, liturgy, in, old, church, slavonic, and, he, expelled, the, disciples, of, methodius, from, moravia, in, 886, after, their, teacher, s, death, svatopluk, s, state, was, a, loose, assemblage, of, principalities, and, also, included, conquered, territories, not, long, after, his, death, svatopluk, s, realm, of, great, moravia, collapsed, in, the, midst, of, a, power, struggle, between, his, sons, and, the, intensifying, hungarian, raids, svatopluk, whose, empire, encompassed, parts, of, the, territory, of, modern, czech, republic, moravia, and, bohemia, slovakia, poland, and, hungary, has, occasionally, been, presented, as, a, slovak, king, in, slovak, literary, works, since, the, 18th, century, the, period, of, the, slovak, national, awakening, the, annals, of, fulda, refer, to, svatopluk, as, a, nephew, of, rastislav, the, second, known, ruler, of, great, moravia, svatopluk, was, most, probably, born, around, 840, his, father, s, name, was, svetimir, according, to, the, late, 12th, century, chronicle, of, the, priest, of, duklja, a, medieval, historical, work, long, dismissed, as, a, collection, of, fact, and, fiction, according, to, the, unproven, later, moravian, tradition, of, tom, pe, ina, z, echorodu, 17th, century, who, fulfilled, the, family, tree, of, the, house, of, mojm, r, svatopluk, was, the, son, of, a, certain, bogislav, according, to, simon, of, k, za, his, father, was, morot, a, prince, of, poland, who, had, subdued, bractari, and, occupied, cri, ana, before, retiring, to, veszpr, m, svatopluk, seems, to, have, risen, to, power, in, great, moravia, in, the, early, 860s, the, life, of, methodius, relates, that, svatopluk, and, his, uncle, jointly, asked, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, to, send, missionaries, who, were, familiar, with, the, slavic, tongue, to, moravia, michael, iii, chose, two, brothers, cyril, and, methodius, who, were, fluent, in, the, dialect, of, slavic, spoken, in, the, environs, of, thessaloniki, greece, they, arrived, in, moravia, in, 863, and, immediately, set, to, work, teaching, and, preaching, their, translation, of, liturgical, texts, into, old, church, slavonic, was, approved, by, pope, hadrian, ii, in, 867, and, it, came, to, pass, in, those, days, that, the, slavic, prince, rostislav, together, with, svatopluk, sent, emissaries, from, moravia, to, emperor, michael, saying, thus, we, have, prospered, through, god, s, grace, and, many, christian, teachers, have, come, to, us, from, among, the, italians, greeks, and, germans, teaching, us, in, various, ways, but, we, slavs, are, a, simple, people, and, have, no, one, to, instruct, us, in, the, truth, and, explain, wisely, therefore, o, kind, lord, send, the, type, of, man, who, will, direct, us, to, the, whole, truth, by, the, time, svatopluk, first, appeared, in, a, frankish, sources, the, annals, of, fulda, in, 869, he, was, ruler, of, his, own, realm, regnum, implying, autonomous, or, semi, autonomous, land, within, great, moravia, this, is, generally, accepted, to, be, the, duchy, of, nitra, his, court, was, at, rastislav, s, old, city, urbs, antique, rastizi, which, may, have, been, either, at, star, m, sto, whose, name, literally, means, old, city, in, czech, or, at, nitra, today, in, slovakia, but, it, has, also, been, identified, with, sirmium, sremska, mitrovica, in, serbia, svatopluk, s, realm, was, invaded, and, plundered, in, 869, by, bavarian, troops, led, by, carloman, the, eldest, son, of, louis, the, german, king, of, east, francia, at, the, same, time, franconian, and, alamannian, troops, attacked, rastislav, s, territories, under, the, leadership, of, the, same, king, s, youngest, son, charles, the, fat, although, the, two, armies, soon, returned, svatopluk, entered, into, clandestine, negotiations, with, carloman, and, agreed, to, commend, himself, and, his, principality, to, carloman, having, learned, of, this, agreement, rastislav, is, said, to, have, become, furious, and, set, a, trap, for, his, nephew, inviting, him, to, a, banquet, where, he, intended, to, have, him, murdered, svatopluk, however, was, warned, of, his, uncle, s, plans, took, rastislav, prisoner, and, handed, him, over, to, carloman, rastislav, was, sent, to, bavaria, under, guard, while, carloman, annexed, his, realm, outright, zwentibald, rastiz, s, nephew, took, thought, to, his, own, interests, and, commended, himself, and, the, kingdom, he, held, to, carloman, rastiz, was, furious, at, this, and, laid, ambushes, in, secret, for, his, nephew, he, plotted, to, strangle, him, at, a, banquet, when, he, was, not, suspecting, any, attack, but, by, the, grace, of, god, he, was, freed, of, the, peril, of, death, for, before, those, who, were, to, kill, him, had, entered, the, house, he, was, warned, by, one, who, knew, of, the, plot, and, set, out, as, if, to, go, hawking, and, so, evaded, the, ambush, laid, for, him, rastiz, saw, that, his, plot, was, revealed, and, followed, after, his, nephew, with, soldiers, to, capture, him, but, by, the, just, judgment, of, god, he, was, caught, in, the, snare, he, had, set, for, he, was, captured, by, his, nephew, bound, and, brought, to, carloman, who, sent, him, under, guard, of, soldiers, to, bavaria, least, he, should, escape, and, had, him, kept, in, prison, until, he, could, be, brought, to, the, king, s, presence, as, a, reward, for, capturing, rastislav, carloman, allowed, svatopluk, to, retain, his, principality, but, the, rest, of, great, moravia, was, placed, under, the, control, of, two, frankish, lords, william, and, engilschalk, carloman, s, forces, also, captured, methodius, whom, pope, hadrian, ii, had, earlier, appointed, archbishop, of, sirmium, with, jurisdiction, over, the, realms, ruled, by, rastislav, and, svatopluk, early, in, 871, carloman, also, imprisoned, svatopluk, on, unspecified, charges, of, disloyalty, which, may, have, been, connected, to, the, rebellion, of, carloman, s, younger, brothers, louis, the, younger, and, charles, the, bald, believing, that, svatopluk, was, dead, the, moravians, selected, another, member, of, their, ruling, family, named, slavom, r, and, made, him, their, ruler, carloman, soon, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, accusations, against, svatopluk, were, unfounded, and, released, him, from, prison, in, order, to, bind, svatopluk, to, his, family, carloman, had, svatopluk, stand, as, godfather, to, his, illegitimate, grandson, thus, this, son, of, carloman, s, son, arnulf, received, the, moravian, name, zwentibold, svatopluk, also, agreed, to, lead, carloman, s, armies, against, slavom, r, and, the, rebellious, moravians, however, on, his, arrival, at, rastislav, s, old, city, svatopluk, betrayed, the, bavarians, and, conspired, secretly, with, the, rebels, although, he, captured, the, fortress, in, accordance, with, carloman, s, plan, once, he, was, inside, its, walls, he, renounced, his, loyalty, to, carloman, rallied, a, large, moravian, force, and, launched, a, devastating, surprise, attack, on, the, unsuspecting, bavarian, army, encamped, outside, the, moravians, took, a, great, number, of, soldiers, hostage, killed, the, rest, and, rid, moravia, of, the, frankish, occupation, carloman, s, governors, william, and, engelschalk, were, also, both, slain, and, svatopluk, became, the, undisputed, ruler, of, great, moravia, meanwhile, zwentibald, after, no, one, had, been, able, to, prove, the, crimes, of, which, he, had, been, accused, was, released, by, carloman, and, returned, to, his, own, realm, laden, with, kingly, gifts, leading, with, him, an, army, of, carloman, s, with, which, he, was, to, drive, out, sclagamar, for, so, much, he, had, falsely, promised, to, carloman, should, carloman, allow, him, to, return, to, his, country, but, just, as, humiliation, falls, on, those, who, are, careless, and, trust, too, much, in, themselves, so, it, befell, that, army, for, zwentibald, left, the, others, to, pitch, camp, and, entered, the, old, city, of, rastiz, immediately, he, denied, his, fidelity, and, forgot, his, oath, in, slavic, fashion, and, turned, his, thought, and, his, powers, not, to, driving, out, sclagamar, but, to, revenging, the, injury, which, carloman, had, done, him, then, he, attacked, in, great, force, the, bavarians, camp, they, suspected, no, evil, and, were, not, keeping, a, sharp, watch, he, took, many, alive, as, prisoners, and, killed, the, rest, except, for, a, few, who, had, prudently, left, the, camp, beforehand, all, the, bavarians, joy, at, their, many, previous, victories, was, turned, into, grief, and, weeping, on, the, news, of, the, slaughter, of, his, army, carloman, was, aghast, and, forced, by, necessity, he, ordered, all, the, hostages, in, his, kingdom, to, be, collected, together, and, returned, to, zwentibald, he, received, scarcely, one, man, from, there, except, for, a, man, called, radbod, who, returned, half, dead, in, october, 871, louis, the, german, sent, bavarian, and, franconian, troops, against, the, bohemians, czechs, during, the, campaign, the, franconians, surprised, a, party, of, moravians, somewhere, near, the, traps, that, guarded, the, narrow, approaches, to, a, bohemian, fort, the, moravians, were, returning, to, their, homeland, with, the, daughter, of, a, bohemian, dux, duke, presumably, to, marry, an, unidentified, moravian, magnate, although, the, moravians, managed, to, reach, the, safety, of, the, fort, they, had, to, abandon, 644, fully, equipped, horses, in, the, narrows, the, marriage, of, a, bohemian, leader, s, daughter, to, a, moravian, magnate, implies, that, svatopluk, was, planning, to, form, an, alliance, with, the, bohemians, louis, the, german, realized, the, grave, threat, posed, by, svatopluk, and, assembled, forces, for, a, multipronged, expedition, with, pincer, movements, advancing, on, moravian, territory, from, several, directions, in, 872, one, army, was, sent, out, against, the, moravian, slavs, from, regensburg, germany, in, may, but, the, thuringian, and, saxon, soldiers, fled, in, their, first, encounter, with, the, enemy, the, second, army, composed, of, franconians, under, bishop, arn, of, w, rzburg, and, abbot, sigihard, of, fulda, experienced, mixed, results, although, their, forces, fought, well, the, majority, of, the, men, were, killed, and, only, a, handful, of, survivors, returned, to, east, francia, finally, a, third, force, consisting, of, bavarians, and, carantanians, under, carloman, s, command, laid, moravian, territories, to, waste, put, svatopluk, s, army, to, flight, and, forced, it, to, take, refuge, in, an, extremely, well, fortified, stronghold, svatopluk, however, soon, assembled, a, large, army, and, attacked, the, bavarians, who, had, been, left, behind, under, the, command, of, bishop, emriacho, of, regensburg, to, guard, ships, on, the, bank, of, the, river, danube, in, may, 873, pope, john, viii, moved, energetically, to, discover, the, whereabouts, of, methodius, who, was, still, being, held, prisoner, in, bavaria, he, sent, harshly, worded, letters, to, carloman, and, the, bavarian, bishops, and, commanded, methodius, s, immediate, reinstatement, the, pope, seems, also, to, have, brokered, a, lasting, peace, between, louis, the, german, and, svatopluk, after, his, meeting, with, the, pope, at, verona, italy, louis, the, german, went, to, forchheim, where, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, he, received, the, legates, of, svatopluk, asking, for, a, peace, treaty, the, exact, terms, of, their, agreement, are, not, known, but, it, seems, to, have, been, a, compromise, svatopluk, was, forced, to, make, an, annual, payment, of, tribute, to, louis, the, german, who, agreed, to, avoid, any, hostile, acts, against, great, moravia, thus, methodius, who, had, in, the, meantime, been, allowed, to, return, to, moravia, could, continue, his, work, in, relatively, peaceful, conditions, for, some, years, great, moravia, underwent, considerable, expansion, in, the, 870s, for, instance, the, life, of, methodius, refers, to, the, capture, of, a, very, powerful, pagan, prince, settled, on, the, vistula, in, territory, of, later, poland, and, a, letter, written, around, 900, by, archbishop, theotmar, of, salzburg, states, that, svatopluk, conquered, the, region, of, nitra, which, had, been, thereto, inhabited, by, pagans, modern, historiography, however, has, tended, to, question, the, claims, that, huge, neighboring, territories, were, permanently, annexed, by, great, moravia, for, instance, there, is, little, clear, archaeological, or, written, evidence, of, a, permanent, extension, of, moravian, power, in, lesser, poland, or, to, the, west, in, silesia, or, in, pannonia, as, is, suggested, in, earlier, historical, works, svatopluk, s, expansionist, policy, was, perhaps, so, successful, because, most, of, western, europe, was, in, the, grip, of, unusually, savage, and, large, scale, viking, raids, between, 879, and, 886, on, the, other, hand, the, life, of, methodius, directly, links, svatopluk, s, military, achievements, and, methodius, work, for, instance, according, to, his, life, methodius, promised, svatopluk, that, if, the, prince, would, celebrate, saint, peter, s, day, in, the, archbishop, s, church, god, will, soon, deliver, his, enemies, to, him, and, so, it, came, to, pass, nevertheless, at, the, court, of, svatopluk, who, himself, professed, the, latin, rite, intrigues, against, methodius, and, the, liturgy, in, old, church, slavonic, gathered, strength, svatopluk, sent, john, of, venice, a, known, opponent, of, the, slavic, liturgy, to, rome, in, 879, to, achieve, a, settlement, of, ecclesiastical, differences, in, a, letter, addressed, to, methodius, in, the, same, year, the, pope, sharply, rebuked, him, for, using, slavonic, in, church, services, methodius, however, travelled, to, rome, in, 880, together, with, a, moravian, delegation, under, his, influence, pope, john, viii, changed, his, mind, and, in, a, letter, known, for, its, incipit, industriae, tuae, the, pope, repeated, that, mass, was, to, be, sung, in, latin, whenever, requested, but, he, also, allowed, the, use, of, slavonic, liturgy, the, letter, also, confirmed, the, decision, taken, by, the, holy, see, during, rastislav, s, reign, to, create, an, archdiocese, for, great, moravia, upon, svatopluk, s, request, the, pope, promoted, a, german, priest, wiching, to, be, bishop, of, nitra, but, he, added, that, the, new, bishop, and, all, the, clerics, in, great, moravia, were, expected, to, be, obedient, to, methodius, who, remained, the, head, of, the, church, in, svatopluk, s, realms, your, predecessor, pope, john, viii, ordained, wiching, bishop, at, the, request, of, duke, zwentibald, however, he, never, sent, him, into, the, ancient, bishopric, of, passau, but, to, a, newly, baptized, people, whom, that, duke, had, defeated, in, war, and, converted, from, paganism, to, christianity, at, the, time, when, charles, the, fat, became, the, sole, ruler, of, east, francia, in, 881, the, sons, of, wilhelm, and, engelschalk, the, one, time, commanders, of, the, bavarian, forces, occupying, moravia, in, 870, 871, began, to, conspire, with, various, bavarian, magnates, in, order, to, eject, arbo, the, margrave, louis, the, german, had, appointed, to, command, a, key, part, of, east, francia, s, frontier, on, the, danube, arbo, however, appealed, for, and, received, help, from, both, charles, the, fat, and, svatopluk, and, even, handed, his, son, over, to, the, latter, as, a, hostage, upon, arbo, s, request, svatopluk, who, remembered, how, much, evil, he, along, with, his, people, had, suffered, at, the, hands, of, wilhelm, and, engelschalk, attacked, their, sons, his, forces, soon, captured, engelschalk, s, second, son, who, was, mutilated, at, svatopluk, s, order, thereafter, the, remaining, sons, withdrew, from, the, authority, of, charles, the, fat, and, become, the, men, of, carloman, s, son, arnulf, who, was, ruling, in, pannonia, at, that, time, learning, of, this, svatopluk, sent, ambassadors, to, arnulf, demanding, that, the, sons, of, wilhelm, and, engelschalk, be, immediately, sent, away, arnulf, however, refused, to, hand, them, over, to, which, svatopluk, responded, with, further, invasions, in, addition, to, the, franks, and, moravians, the, bulgarians, also, entered, the, conflict, by, invading, svatopluk, s, realm, according, to, a, record, in, the, annals, of, salzburg, the, region, of, vienna, austria, was, also, invaded, in, 881, by, hungarians, they, seem, to, have, been, hired, either, by, svatopluk, or, by, arnulf, in, order, to, intervene, in, their, conflict, thus, the, willhelminer, war, that, was, to, last, until, 884, led, to, the, devastation, of, pannonia, east, of, the, river, r, ba, finally, charles, the, fat, himself, turned, up, and, received, svatopluk, as, his, man, at, kaumberg, germany, receiving, promises, of, peace, and, fidelity, svatopluk, also, promised, never, to, invade, charles, the, fat, s, realm, with, a, hostile, force, as, long, as, he, lived, while, charles, the, fat, recognized, him, as, a, prince, of, his, realm, peace, between, arnulf, and, svatopluk, however, was, only, sealed, in, the, latter, part, of, the, following, year, they, the, sons, of, wilhelm, and, engelschalk, despised, the, peace, which, in, being, preserved, pannonia, but, which, being, broken, led, to, pannonia, s, being, laid, waste, from, the, raab, eastward, within, the, space, of, two, and, a, half, years, male, and, female, slaves, with, their, children, were, killed, many, of, the, leading, men, were, killed, captured, or, what, is, more, disgraceful, had, their, hand, or, tongue, or, genitals, cut, off, and, were, sent, back, methodius, who, seems, to, have, been, in, svatopluk, s, train, at, kaumberg, died, in, 885, in, his, last, days, he, had, indicated, gorazd, one, of, his, moravian, disciples, as, most, worthy, to, succeed, him, gorazd, however, did, not, or, could, not, immediately, submit, his, candidature, for, ratification, of, the, holy, see, because, bishop, wiching, of, nitra, soon, hurried, to, rome, he, persuaded, pope, stephen, v, that, methodius, had, ignored, pope, john, viii, s, orders, in, the, matter, of, slavonic, liturgy, and, thus, upon, his, initiative, the, pope, prohibited, the, slavonic, liturgy, in, moravia, the, pope, also, sent, a, letter, quia, te, zelo, to, svatopluk, urging, him, to, accept, the, addition, of, filioque, to, the, creed, and, to, give, up, such, peculiar, byzantine, practices, as, fasting, on, saturday, wiching, having, arrived, back, from, rome, svatopluk, summoned, gorazd, clement, and, methodius, s, other, disciples, to, submit, to, the, papal, directions, when, they, refused, to, do, so, svatopluk, gave, wiching, a, free, hand, to, take, action, against, them, some, of, them, were, first, thrown, into, prison, and, soon, expelled, from, moravia, while, others, among, them, naum, were, sold, as, slaves, the, expulsion, of, methodius, s, disciples, from, moravia, signaled, the, end, of, the, slavonic, liturgy, in, central, europe, the, exiles, however, subsequently, found, refuge, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, where, they, were, able, to, carry, on, their, work, saint, clement, of, ochrid, said, the, prince, however, understood, very, little, of, what, was, said, as, he, was, too, completely, and, utterly, dumb, to, comprehend, any, divine, matter, he, was, brought, up, in, a, sheer, barbaric, manner, briefly, said, with, no, education, whatsoever, and, also, because, vicarious, pleasures, rid, him, of, all, his, sense, how, could, a, man, entirely, distanced, from, the, sanctity, of, modest, life, without, which, no, one, lays, his, eyes, on, the, lord, ever, penetrate, any, contemplations, of, the, trinity, in, his, letter, quia, te, zelo, the, pope, addressed, svatopluk, as, rex, sclavorum, king, of, the, slavs, although, svatopluk, s, royal, title, was, not, recognized, by, the, contemporary, annals, of, fulda, the, chronicler, regino, of, pr, m, also, referred, to, svatopluk, as, rex, marahensium, sclavorum, king, of, the, moravian, slavs, in, the, early, 10th, century, which, is, independent, evidence, confirming, that, svatopluk, held, the, title, of, king, according, to, the, late, 12th, century, chronicle, of, the, priest, of, duklja, svatopluk, had, been, crowned, king, in, the, roman, fashion, on, the, field, of, dalma, in, the, presence, of, a, papal, legate, cardinals, and, bishops, in, 887, arnulf, svatopluk, s, opponent, in, the, wilhelminer, war, became, the, king, of, east, francia, they, met, at, omuntesperch, a, locality, that, has, yet, not, been, identified, during, the, winter, of, 890, at, the, meeting, svatopluk, transmitted, to, arnulf, a, message, from, pope, stephen, v, urging, the, king, to, invade, italy, to, protect, the, holy, see, according, to, regino, of, pr, m, the, two, monarchs, also, concluded, an, agreement, in, which, arnulf, ceded, the, ducatus, of, the, bohemians, to, svatopluk, in, the, year, of, the, lord, s, incarnation, 890, king, arnulf, gave, the, command, of, the, bohemians, to, king, zwentibald, of, the, moravian, slavs, hitherto, the, bohemians, had, rulers, from, among, their, own, kind, and, people, and, had, kept, the, fidelity, they, promised, to, the, kings, of, the, franks, by, inviolable, agreement, arnulf, did, this, because, before, he, had, been, raised, to, the, throne, of, the, kingdom, he, had, been, joined, to, zwentibald, in, close, friendship, sometime, during, 891, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, arnulf, sent, an, embassy, led, by, margrave, arbo, to, moravia, in, order, to, renew, the, peace, a, letter, written, by, the, margrave, soon, announced, that, the, legates, were, returning, from, svatopluk, and, the, moravians, who, had, agreed, to, give, themselves, in, friendship, svatopluk, however, broke, his, pledges, so, arnulf, decided, to, invade, moravia, in, 891, first, the, king, met, with, braslav, the, slavic, dux, on, the, river, sava, then, raised, an, army, of, franconians, bavarians, and, alamanni, and, also, recruited, hungarians, to, join, his, campaign, in, the, late, 10th, century, arnulf, was, accused, by, ottonian, authors, of, unleashing, the, hungarians, on, europe, because, of, his, desire, to, bring, down, moravia, meanwhile, arnulf, the, strongest, king, of, the, nations, living, below, the, star, arcturus, could, not, overcome, sviatopolk, duke, of, the, moravians, who, we, mentioned, above, with, the, latter, fighting, back, in, a, manly, way, and, alas, having, dismantled, those, very, well, fortified, barriers, which, we, said, earlier, are, called, closures, by, the, populace, arnulf, summoned, to, his, aid, the, nation, of, the, hungarians, greedy, rash, ignorant, of, almighty, god, but, well, versed, in, every, crime, avid, only, for, murder, and, plunder, if, indeed, it, can, be, called, aid, since, a, little, later, with, him, dying, it, proved, to, be, grave, peril, and, even, the, occasion, of, ruin, for, his, people, alongside, the, other, nations, living, in, the, south, and, west, arnulf, s, invasion, started, in, july, 892, but, he, failed, to, defeat, svatopluk, the, war, against, moravia, seems, to, have, continued, until, 894, this, was, the, year, of, svatopluk, s, most, unlucky, death, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, which, implies, that, he, met, his, end, in, some, kind, of, mishap, the, sort, that, occurs, in, war, the, exact, circumstances, of, svatopluk, s, death, however, are, unknown, zwentibald, the, dux, of, the, moravians, and, the, source, of, all, treachery, who, had, disturbed, all, the, lands, around, him, with, tricks, and, cunning, and, circled, around, thirsting, for, human, blood, made, an, unhappy, end, exhorting, his, men, at, the, last, that, they, should, not, be, lovers, of, peace, but, rather, continue, in, enmity, with, their, neighbors, simon, of, k, za, recorded, that, he, died, in, battle, near, k, rnye, following, svatopluk, s, death, great, moravia, which, had, achieved, its, maximum, territorial, extension, and, exercised, its, greatest, influence, in, his, reign, ceased, to, be, a, political, factor, in, central, europe, among, the, conquered, peoples, the, czechs, were, the, first, to, withdraw, in, 895, although, at, least, according, to, the, testimony, of, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, porphyrogenitus, svatopluk, had, made, a, deathbed, request, to, his, sons, mojmir, ii, of, moravia, and, svatopluk, ii, that, they, remain, united, after, his, death, internal, disagreements, between, them, were, fostered, by, arnulf, finally, moravia, collapsed, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 10th, century, due, to, the, invasion, of, the, hungarians, the, prince, of, moravia, sphendoplokos, was, valiant, and, terrible, to, the, nations, that, were, his, neighbors, this, same, sphendoplokos, had, three, sons, and, when, he, was, dying, he, divided, his, country, into, three, parts, and, left, a, share, apiece, to, his, three, sons, leaving, the, eldest, to, be, great, prince, and, the, other, two, to, be, under, the, command, of, the, eldest, son, he, exhorted, them, not, to, fall, out, with, one, another, giving, them, this, example, by, way, of, illustration, he, brought, three, wands, and, bound, them, together, and, gave, them, to, the, first, son, to, break, them, and, when, he, was, not, strong, enough, handed, them, on, to, the, second, and, in, like, manner, to, the, third, and, then, separated, the, three, wands, and, gave, one, each, to, the, three, of, them, when, they, had, taken, them, and, were, bidden, to, break, them, they, broke, them, through, at, once, by, means, of, this, illustration, he, exhorted, them, and, said, if, you, remain, undivided, in, concord, and, love, you, shall, be, unconquered, by, your, adversaries, and, invincible, but, if, strife, and, rivalry, come, among, you, and, you, divide, yourselves, into, three, governments, not, subject, to, the, eldest, brother, you, shall, be, both, destroyed, by, one, another, and, brought, to, utter, ruin, by, the, enemies, who, are, your, neighbors, according, to, hungarian, legends, the, hungarians, purchased, the, country, from, svatopluk, in, a, symbolic, act, of, exchange, they, sent, a, white, horse, with, saddler, to, svatopluk, in, return, for, some, earth, water, and, grass, supposed, to, represent, his, country, itself, svatopluk, allegedly, disavowed, this, contract, and, then, drowned, in, the, danube, in, flight, from, the, hungarians, the, legend, in, fact, seems, to, merely, describe, a, common, pagan, rite, of, concluding, alliances, which, might, refer, to, svatopluk, s, alliance, with, the, hungarians, in, 894, historian, ryszard, grzesik, says, that, the, ruler, menumorut, mentioned, in, the, 13th, century, chronicle, gesta, hungarorum, was, the, personification, of, svatopluk, i, of, moravia, nevertheless, in, 1722, michael, bencsik, a, professor, of, hungarian, law, at, the, university, of, trnava, suggested, that, the, nobility, and, the, whole, population, of, trencs, n, county, within, the, kingdom, of, hungary, were, the, remnants, of, svatopluk, who, sold, his, country, to, the, hungarians, and, thus, the, slovak, people, into, eternal, serfdom, in, response, j, n, baltaz, r, magin, the, roman, catholic, pastor, of, dubnica, wrote, the, oldest, known, defense, of, the, slovak, nation, in, 1728, next, another, catholic, priest, juraj, f, ndly, completed, a, history, in, latin, entitled, compendiata, historia, gentis, slavae, a, brief, history, of, the, slovak, nation, in, which, he, depicted, moravia, as, a, state, of, slovaks, and, svatopluk, as, their, king, in, 1833, the, poet, j, n, holl, published, a, poem, entitled, sv, topluk, the, first, of, a, series, of, epic, poems, dealing, with, the, past, of, the, slovak, people
