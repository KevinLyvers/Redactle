1927, though, it, was, not, released, until, june, 1928, a, girl, in, every, port, is, considered, by, scholars, to, be, the, most, important, of, hawks, s, silent, films, it, is, the, first, to, feature, many, of, the, themes, and, archetypes, that, would, define, much, of, his, subsequent, work, it, was, his, first, love, story, between, two, men, with, two, men, bonding, over, their, duty,

detective, stories, of, all, time, and, was, eager, to, make, it, his, first, sound, film, he, cast, raymond, griffith, in, the, lead, role, of, phillip, trent, griffith, s, throat, had, been, damaged, by, poison, gas, during, world, war, i, and, his, voice, was, a, hoarse, whisper, prompting, hawks, to, later, state, i, thought, he, ought, to, be, great, in, talking, pictures, because, of, that, voice, however, after, shooting, only, a, few, scenes, fox, shut, hawks, down, and, ordered, him, to, make, a, silent, film, both, because, of, griffith, s, voice, and, because, they, only, owned, the, legal, rights, to, make, a, silent, film, the, film, did, have, a, musical, score, and, synchronized, sound, effects, but, no, dialogue, due, to, the, failing, business, of, silent, films,

of, his, long, career, by, 1930, hollywood, was, in, upheaval, over, the, coming, of, talkies, and, the, careers, of, many, actors, and, directors, were, ruined, hollywood, studios, were, recruiting, stage, actors, and, directors, that, they, believed, were, better, suited, for, sound, films, after, working, in, the, industry, for, 14, years, and, directing, many, financially, successful, films, hawks, found, he, had, to, prove, himself, an, asset, to, the, studios, once, again, leaving, fox, on, sour, terms, did, not, help, his, reputation, but, hawks, never, backed, down, from, fights, with, studio, heads, after, several, months, of, unemployment, hawks, renewed, his, career, with, his, first, sound, film, in, 1930, hawks, s, first, all, sound, film, was, the, dawn, patrol, based, on, an, original, story, by, john, monk, saunders, and, unofficially, hawks, reportedly, hawks, paid, saunders, to, put, his, name, on, the, film, so, that, hawks, could, direct, the, film, without, arousing, concern, due, to, his, lack, of, writing, experience, accounts, vary, on, who, came, up, with, the, idea, of, the, film, but, hawks, and, saunders, developed, the, story, together, and, tried, to, sell, it, to, several, studios, before, first, national, agreed, to, produce, it, shooting, began, in, late, february, 1930, about, the, same, time, that, howard, hughes, was, finishing, his, epic, world, war, i, aviation, epic, hell, s, angels, which, had, been, in, production, since, september, 1927, shrewdly, hawks, began, to, hire, many, of, the, aviation, experts, and, cameramen, that, had, been, employed, by, hughes, including, elmer, dyer, harry, reynolds, and, ira, reed, when, hughes, found, out, about, the, rival, film, he, did, everything, he, could, to, sabotage, the, dawn, patrol, he, harassed, hawks, and, other, studio, personnel, hired, a, spy, that, was, quickly, caught, and, finally, sued, first, national, for, copyright, infringement, hughes, eventually,

first, week, box, office, record, at, the, winter, garden, theatre, in, new, york, the, film, became, one, of, the, biggest, hits, of, 1930, the, success, of, this, film, allowed, hawks, to, gain, respect, in, the, field, of, filmmaking, and, allowed, him, to, spend, the, rest, of, his, career, as, an, independent, director, without, the, necessity, to, sign, any, long, term, contracts, with, specific, studios, hawks, did, not, get, along, with, warner, brothers, executive, hal, b, wallis, and, his, contract, allowed, him, to, be, loaned, out, to, other, studios, hawks, took, the,

men, fought, negotiated, and, made, compromises, with, the, hays, office, for, over, a, year, until, the, film, was, eventually, released, in, 1932, after, such, other, pivotal, early, gangster,

hawks, s, own, functional, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, good, film, is, characteristic, of, his, no, nonsense, style, three, good, scenes, and, no, bad, ones, hawks, also, defined, a, good, director, as, someone, who, doesn, t, annoy, you, in, hawks, s, own, words, his, directing, style, is, based, on, being, enjoyable, and, straightforward, his, style, was, very, actor, focused, and, he, made, it, a, point, to, take, as, few, shots, as, possible, thereby, preserving, an, inherent, and, natural, humor, for, his, comedic, pieces, while, hawks, was, not, sympathetic, to, feminism, he, popularized, the, hawksian, woman, archetype, a, portrayal, of, women, in, stronger, less, effeminate, roles, such, an, emphasis, had, never, been, done, in, the, 1920s, and, therefore, was, seen, to, be, a, rarity, and, according, to, naomi, wise, has, been, cited, as, a, prototype, of, the, post, feminist, movement, another, notable, theme, carried, throughout, his, work, included, the, relationship, of, morality, and, human, interaction, in, this, sense, he, tended, to, portray, more, dramatic, elements, of, a, concept, or, a, plot, in, a, humorous, way, orson, welles, in,

retained, an, independent, sensibility, film, critic, david, thomson, wrote, of, hawks, far, from, being, the, meek, purveyor, of, hollywood, forms, he, always, chose, to, turn, them, upside, down, to, have, and, have, not, and, the, big, sleep, ostensibly, an, adventure, and, a, thriller, are, really, love, stories, rio, bravo, apparently, a, western, everyone, wears, a, cowboy, hat, is, a, comedy, conversation, piece, the, ostensible, comedies, are, shot, through, with, exposed, emotions, with, the, subtlest, views, of, the, sex, war, and, with, a, wry, acknowledgment, of, the, incompatibility, of, men, and, women, david, boxwell, argues, that, the, filmmaker, s, body, of, work, has, been, accused, of, a, historical, and, adolescent, escapism, but, hawks, s, fans, rejoice, in, his, oeuvre, s, remarkable, avoidance, of, hollywood, s, religiosity, bathos, flag, waving, and, sentimentality, in, addition, to, his, career, as, a, film, director, howard, hawks, either, wrote, or, supervised, the, writing, for, most, of, his, films, in, some, cases, he, would, rewrite, parts, of, the, script, on, set, due, to, the, screen, writer, s, guild, s, rule, that, the, director, and, producer, couldn, t, receive, credit, for, writing, hawks, rarely, received, credit, even, though, sidney, howard, received, credit, for, writing, gone, with, the, wind, 1939, the, screenplay,

screenplays, such, as, underworld, 1927, morocco, 1930, shanghai, express, 1932, and, gunga, din, 1939, hawks, also, produced, many, of, his, own, films, preferring, not, to, work, under, major, film, studios, because, it, allowed, him, creative, freedom, in, his, writing, directing, and, casting, hawks, would, sometimes, walk, out, on, films, that, he, wasn, t, producing, himself, hawks, however, never, considered, producing, to, come, before, his, directing, for, example, several, of, the, film, cards, for, his, films, show, directed, and, produced, by, howard, hawks, with, produced, underneath, directed, in, much, smaller, font, sometimes, his, films, wouldn, t, credit, any, producer, hawks, discovered, many, well, known, film, stars, such, as, paul, muni, george, raft, ann,

directors, such, as, john, ford, however, after, reading, cahiers, du, cin, ma, archer, learned, that, the, french, film, scene, was, more, interested, in, alfred, hitchcock, and, howard, hawks, books, were, not, written, on, hawks, until, the, 1960s, and, a, full, biography, on, hawks, wasn, t, published, until, 1997, twenty, years, after, his, death, film, critic, andrew, sarris, cited, howard, hawks, as, the, least, known, and, least, appreciated, hollywood, director, of, any, stature, according, to, professor, of, film, studies, ian, brookes, hawks, is, not, as, well, known, as, other, directors, because, of, his, lack, of, association, with, a, particular, genre, such, as, ford, with, western, and, hitchcock, with, thriller, hawks, worked, across, many, genres, including, gangster, film, noir, musical, comedy, romantic, comedy, screwball, comedy, western, aviation, and, combat, moreover, hawks, preferred, not, to, associate, with, major, studios, during, his, film, production, he, worked, for, all, major, studios, at, least, once, on, short, term, contract, but, many, of, his, films, were, produced, under, his, own, name, the, simplicity, of, his, narratives, and, stories, may, also, have, contributed, to, his, under, recognition, commercially, his, films, were, successful, but, he, received, little, critical, acclaim, except, for, one, academy, award,

some, critics, limit, hawks, by, his, action, films, describing, hawks, as, a, director, who, produced, films, with, a, masculine, bias, however, action, scenes, in, hawks, s, films, were, often, left, to, second, unit, directors, and, hawks, actually, preferred, to, work, indoors, howard, hawks, s, style, is, difficult, to, interpret, because, there, is, no, recognizable, relationship, between, his, visual, and, narrative, style, as, in, the, films, of, his, contemporary, directors, because, his, camera, style, was, derived, more, from, his, working, method, rather, than, anecdotal, or, visual, realization, his, camera, work, is, unobtrusive, making, his, films, appear, to, have, little, to, no, cinematographic, style, hawks, s, style, can, rather, be, characterized, as,
