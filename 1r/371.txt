for, gide, in, 1916, gide, was, about, 47, years, old, when, he, took, marc, all, gret, age, 15, as, a, lover, marc, was, one, of, five, children, of, lie, all, gret, and, his, wife, gide, had,

arrived, in, paris, following, the, 1914, german, invasion, of, belgium, their, friendship, later, declined, due, to, du, bos, s, perception, that, gide, had, disavowed, or, betrayed, his, spiritual, faith, in, contrast, to, du, bos, s, own, return, to, faith, du, bos, s, essay, dialogue, avec, andr, gide, was, published, in, 1929, the, essay, informed, by, du, bos, s, catholic, convictions,

catholic, morals, suffices, to, neglect, his, complete, indictment, it, can, only, touch, those, who, think, like, him, and, are, convinced, in, advance, he, has, abdicated, his, intellectual, liberty, in, the, 1920s, gide, became, an, inspiration, for, such, writers, as, albert, camus, and, jean, paul, sartre, in, 1923, he, published, a, book, on, fyodor, dostoyevsky, when, he, defended, homosexuality, in, the, public, edition, of, corydon, 1924, he, received, widespread, condemnation, he, later, considered, this, his, most, important, work, in, 1923, gide, sired, a, daughter, catherine, by, elisabeth, van, rysselberghe, a, much, younger, woman, he, had, known, her, for, a, long, time, as, she, was, the, daughter, of, his, friends, maria, monnom, and, th, o, van, rysselberghe, a, belgian, neo, impressionist, painter, this, caused, the, only, crisis, in, the, long, standing, relationship, between, all, gret, and, gide, and, damaged, his, friendship, with, van, rysselberghe, this, was, possibly, gide, s, only, sexual, relationship, with, a, woman, and, it, was, brief, in, the, extreme, catherine, was, his, only, descendant, by, blood, he, liked, to, call, elisabeth, la, dame, blanche, the, white, lady, elisabeth, eventually, left, her, husband, to, move, to, paris, and, manage, the, practical, aspects, of, gide, s, life, they, had, adjoining,

grain, ne, meurt, in, the, same, year, he, produced, the, first, french, language, editions, of, joseph, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, and, lord, jim, after, 1925, gide, began, to, campaign, for, more, humane, conditions, for, convicted, criminals, his, legal, wife, madeleine, gide, died, in, 1938, later, he, explored, their, unconsummated, marriage, in, et, nunc, manet, in, te, his, memoir, of, madeleine, published, in, english, in, the, united, states, in, 1952, from, july, 1926, to, may, 1927, gide, traveled, through, the, colony, of, french, equatorial, africa, with, his, lover, marc, all, gret, they, went, successively, to, middle, congo, now, the, republic, of, the, congo, ubangi, shari, now, the, central, african, republic, briefly, to, chad, and, then, to, cameroon, he, kept, a, journal, which, he, published, as, travels, in, the, congo, french, voyage, au, congo, and, return, from, chad, french, retour, du, tchad, in, this, work, he, criticized, the, behavior, of, french, business, interests, in, the, congo, and, inspired, reform, in, particular, he, strongly, criticized, the, large, concessions, regime, french, r, gime, des, grandes, concessions, the, government, had, conceded, part, of, the, colony, to, french, companies, allowing, them, to, exploit, the, area, s, natural, resources, in, particular, rubber, he, related, that, native, workers, were, forced, to, leave, their, village, for, several, weeks, to, collect, rubber, in, the, forest, and, compared, their, exploitation, by, the, companies, to, slavery, the, book, contributed, to, the, growing, anti, colonialism, movements, in, france, and, helped, thinkers, to, re, evaluate, the, effects, of, colonialism, in, africa, during, the, 1930s, gide, briefly, became, a, communist, or, more, precisely, a, fellow, traveler, he, never, formally, joined, any, communist, party, but, he, an, individualist, himself, advocated, the, idea, of, communist, individualism, despite, supporting, the, soviet, union, he, acknowledged, the, political, repression, in, the, ussr, gide, insisted, on, the, release, of, victor, serge, a, soviet, writer, and, a, member, of, the, left, opposition, who, was, prosecuted, by, the, stalinist, regime, for, his, views, as, a, distinguished, writer, sympathizing, with, the, cause, of, communism, he, was, invited, to, speak, at, maxim, gorky, s, funeral, and, to, tour, the, soviet, union, as, a, guest, of, the, soviet, union, of, writers, he, encountered, censorship, of, his, speeches, and, was, particularly, disillusioned, with, the, state, of, culture, under, soviet, communism, in, his, work, retour, de, l, u, r, s, s, return, from, the, ussr, 1936, he, broke, with, such, socialist, friends, as, jean, paul, sartre, the, book, was, addressed, to, pro, soviet, readers, so, the, purpose, was, to, expose, a, reader, to, doubts, instead, of, presenting, harsh, criticism, while, admitting, the, economic, and, social, achievements, of, the, ussr, compared, to, the, russian, empire, he, noted, the, decay, of, culture, the, erasure, of, the, individuality, of, soviet, citizens, and, the, suppression, of, any, dissent, then, would, it, not, be, better, to, instead, of, playing, on, words, simply, to, acknowledge, that, the, revolutionary, spirit, or, even, simply, the, critical, spirit, is, no, longer, the, correct, thing, that, it, is, not, wanted, any, more, what, is, wanted, now, is, compliance, conformism, what, is, desired, and, demanded, is, approval, of, all, that, is, done, in, the, u, s, s, r, and, an, attempt, is, being, made, to, obtain, an, approval, that, is, not, mere, resignation, but, a, sincere, an, enthusiastic, approval, what, is, most, astounding, is, that, this, attempt, is, successful, on, the, other, hand, the, smallest, protest, the, least, criticism, is, liable, to, the, severest, penalties, and, in, fact, is, immediately, stifled, and, i, doubt, whether, in, any, other, country, in, the, world, even, hitler, s, germany, thought, to, be, less, free, more, bowed, down, more, fearful, terrorized, more, vassalized, gide, does, not, express, his, attitude, towards, stalin, but, he, describes, the, signs, of, his, personality, cult, in, each, the, same, portrait, of, stalin, and, nothing, else, portrait, of, stalin, in, the, same, place, no, doubt, where, the, icon, used, to, be, is, it, adoration, love, or, fear, i, do, not, know, always, and, everywhere, he, is, present, however, gide, wrote, that, these, problems, could, be, solved, by, raising, the, cultural, level, of, soviet, society, when, gide, began, preparing, his, manuscript, for, publication, the, kremlin, was, immediately, informed, about, it, and, soon, gide, would, be, visited, by, the, soviet, author, ilya, ehrenburg, who, said, that, he, agreed, with, gide, but, asked, to, postpone, the, publication, as, the, soviet, union, assisted, the, republicans, in, spain, two, days, later, louis, aragon, delivered, a, letter, from, jef, last, asking, to, postpone, the, publication, these, measures, didn, t, help, and, as, the, book, was, published, gide, was, condemned, in, the, soviet, press, and, by, the, friends, of, the, ussr, nordahl, grieg, wrote, that, the, reason, of, writing, the, book, was, gide, s, impatience, and, that, with, his, book, he, made, a, favour, to, the, fascists, who, greeted, it, with, joy, in, 1937, in, response, gide, published, afterthoughts, on, the, u, s, s, r, earlier, gide, read, trotsky, s, the, revolution, betrayed, and, met, victor, serge, who, provided, him, more, information, about, the, soviet, union, in, afterthoughts, gide, is, more, direct, in, his, criticism, of, the, soviet, society, citrine, trotsky, mercier, yvon, victor, serge, leguay, rudolf, and, many, others, have, helped, me, with, their, documentation, everything, they, have, taught, me, so, far, i, had, only, suspected, it, has, confirmed, and, reinforced, my, fears, the, main, points, of, afterthoughts, were, that, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, became, the, dictatorship, of, stalin, and, that, the, privileged, bureaucracy, became, the, new, ruling, class, which, profited, by, the, workers, surplus, labour, spending, the, state, budget, on, projects, like, the, palace, of, soviets, or, to, raise, its, own, standards, of, living, while, the, working, class, lived, in, extreme, poverty, gide, cited, the, official, soviet, newspapers, to, prove, his, statements, during, the, world, war, ii, gide, came, to, a, conclusion, that, absolute, liberty, destroys, the, individual, and, also, society, unless, it, be, closely, linked, to, tradition, and, discipline, he, rejected, the, revolutionary, idea, of, communism, as, breaking, with, the, traditions, and, wrote, that, if, civilization, depended, solely, on, those, who, initiated, revolutionary, theories, then, it, would, perish, since, culture, needs, for, its, survival, a, continuous, and, developing, tradition, in, thesee, written, in, 1946, he, showed, that, an, individual, may, safely, leave, the, maze, only, if, he, had, clung, tightly, to, the, thread, which, linked, him, with, the, past, in, 1947, he, said, that, although, during, the, human, history, the, civilizations, rose, up, and, died, the, christian, civilization, may, be, saved, from, doom, if, we, accepted, the, responsibility, of, the, sacred, charge, laid, on, us, by, our, traditions, and, our, past, he, also, said, that, he, remained, an, individualist, and, protested, against, the, submersion, of, individual, responsibility, in, organized, authority, in, that, escape, from, freedom, which, is, characteristic, of, our, age, gide, contributed, to, the, 1949, anthology, the, god, that, failed, he, could, not, write, an, essay, because, of, his, state, of, health, so, the, text, was, written, by, enid, starkie, based, on, paraphrases, of, return, from, the, ussr, afterthoughts, from, a, discussion, held, in, paris, at, l, union, pour, la, verite, in, 1935, and, from, his, journal, the, text, was, approved, by, gide, in, 1930, gide, published, a, book, about, the, blanche, monnier, case, titled, la, s, questr, e, de, poitiers, changing, little, but, the, names, of, the, protagonists, monnier, was, a, young, woman, who, was, kept, captive, by, her, own, mother, for, more, than, 25, years, in, 1939, gide, became, the, first, living, author, to, be, published, in, the, prestigious, biblioth, que, de, la, pl, iade, he, left, france, for, africa, in, 1942, and, lived, in, tunis, from, december, 1942, until, it, was, re, taken, by, french, british, and, american, forces, in, may, 1943, and, he, was, able, to, travel, to, algiers, where, he, stayed, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1947, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, for, his, comprehensive, and, artistically, significant, writings, in, which, human, problems, and, conditions, have, been, presented, with, a, fearless, love, of, truth, and, keen, psychological, insight, he, devoted, much, of, his, last, years, to, publishing, his, journal, gide, died, in, paris, on, 19, february, 1951, the, roman, catholic, church, placed, his, works, on, the, index, of, forbidden, books, in, 1952, gide, s, biographer, alan, sheridan, summed, up, gide, s, life, as, a, writer, and, an, intellectual, gide, was, by, general, consent, one, of, the, dozen, most, important, writers, of, the, 20th, century, moreover, no, writer, of, such, stature, had, led, such, an, interesting, life, a, life, accessibly, interesting, to, us, as, readers, of, his, autobiographical, writings, his, journal, his, voluminous, correspondence, and, the, testimony, of, others, it, was, the, life, of, a, man, engaging, not, only, in, the, business, of, artistic, creation, but, reflecting, on, that, process, in, his, journal, reading, that, work, to, his, friends, and, discussing, it, with, them, a, man, who, knew, and, corresponded, with, all, the, major, literary, figures, of, his, own, country, and, with, many, in, germany, and, england, who, found, daily, nourishment, in, the, latin, french, english, and, german, classics, and, for, much, of, his, life, in, the, bible, and, who, engaged, in, commenting, on, the, moral, political, and, sexual, questions, of, the, day, gide, s, fame, rested, ultimately, of, course, on, his, literary, works, but, unlike, many, writers, he, was, no, recluse, he, had, a, need, of, friendship, and, a, genius, for, sustaining, it, but, his, capacity, for, love, was, not, confined, to, his, friends, it, spilled, over, into, a, concern, for, others, less, fortunate, than, himself, andr, gide, s, writings, spanned, many, genres, as, a, master, of, prose, narrative, occasional, dramatist, and, translator, literary, critic, letter, writer, essayist, and, diarist, andr, gide, provided, twentieth, century, french, literature, with, one, of, its, most, intriguing, examples, of, the, man, of, letters, but, as, gide, s, biographer, alan, sheridan, points, out, it, is, the, fiction, that, lies, at, the, summit, of, gide, s, work, here, as, in, the, oeuvre, as, a, whole, what, strikes, one, first, is, the, variety, here, too, we, see, gide, s, curiosity, his, youthfulness, at, work, a, refusal, to, mine, only, one, seam, to, repeat, successful, formulas, the, fiction, spans, the, early, years, of, symbolism, to, the, comic, more, inventive, even, fantastic, pieces, to, the, later, serious, heavily, autobiographical, first, person, narratives, in, france, gide, was, considered, a, great, stylist, in, the, classical, sense, with, his, clear, succinct, spare, deliberately, subtly, phrased, sentences, gide, s, surviving, letters, run, into, the, thousands, but, it, is, the, journal, that, sheridan, calls, the, pre, eminently, gidean, mode, of, expression, his, first, novel, emerged, from, gide, s, own, journal, and, many, of, the, first, person, narratives, read, more, or, less, like, journals, in, les, faux, monnayeurs, edouard, s, journal, provides, an, alternative, voice, to, the, narrator, s, in, 1946, when, pierre, herbert, asked, gide, which, of, his, books, he, would, choose, if, only, one, were, to, survive, gide, replied, i, think, it, would, be, my, journal, beginning, at, the, age, of, 18, or, 19, gide, kept, a, journal, all, of, his, life, and, when, these, were, first, made, available, to, the, public, they, ran, to, 1, 300, pages, each, volume, that, gide, wrote, was, intended, to, challenge, itself, what, had, preceded, it, and, what, could, conceivably, follow, it, this, characteristic, according, to, daniel, moutote, in, his, cahiers, de, andr, gide, essay, is, what, makes, gide, s, work, essentially, modern, the, perpetual, renewal, of, the, values, by, which, one, lives, gide, wrote, in, his, journal, in, 1930, the, only, drama, that, really, interests, me, and, that, i, should, always, be, willing, to, depict, anew, is, the, debate, of, the, individual, with, whatever, keeps, him, from, being, authentic, with, whatever, is, opposed, to, his, integrity, to, his, integration, most, often, the, obstacle, is, within, him, and, all, the, rest, is, merely, accidental, as, a, whole, the, works, of, andr, gide, reveal, his, passionate, revolt, against, the, restraints, and, conventions, inherited, from, 19th, century, france, he, sought, to, uncover, the, authentic, self, beneath, its, contradictory, masks, in, his, journal, gide, distinguishes, between, adult, attracted, sodomites, and, boy, loving, pederasts, categorizing, himself, as, the, latter, i, call, a, pederast, the, man, who, as, the, word, indicates, falls, in, love, with, young, boys, i, call, a, sodomite, the, word, is, sodomite, sir, said, verlaine, to, the, judge, who, asked, him, if, it, were, true, that, he, was, a, sodomist, the, man, whose, desire, is, addressed, to, mature, men, the, pederasts, of, whom, i, am, one, why, cannot, i, say, this, quite, simply, without, your, immediately, claiming, to, see, a, brag, in, my, confession, are, much, rarer, and, the, sodomites, much, more, numerous, than, i, first, thought, that, such, loves, can, spring, up, that, such, relationships, can, be, formed, it, is, not, enough, for, me, to, say, that, this, is, natural, i, maintain, that, it, is, good, each, of, the, two, finds, exaltation, protection, a, challenge, in, them, and, i, wonder, whether, it, is, for, the, youth, or, the, elder, man, that, they, are, more, profitable, from, an, interview, with, film, documentarian, nicole, v, dr, s, with, andre, gide, v, dr, s, may, i, ask, you, an, indiscreet, question, gide, there, are, no, indiscreet, questions, only, indiscreet, answers, v, dr, s, is, it, true, cher, ma, tre, that, you, are, a, homosexual, gide, no, monsieur, i, am, not, a, homosexual, i, am, a, pederast, from, vedres, documentary, life, starts, tomorrow, 1950, gide, s, journal, documents, his, behavior, in, the, company, of, oscar, wilde, wilde, took, a, key, out, of, his, pocket, and, showed, me, into, a, tiny, apartment, of, two, rooms, the, youths, followed, him, each, of, them, wrapped, in, a, burnous, that, hid, his, face, then, the, guide, left, us, and, wilde, sent, me, into, the, further, room, with, little, mohammed, and, shut, himself, up, in, the, other, with, the, every, time, since, then, that, i, have, sought, after, pleasure, it, is, the, memory, of, that, night, i, have, pursued, my, joy, was, unbounded, and, i, cannot, imagine, it, greater, even, if, love, had, been, added, how, should, there, have, been, any, question, of, love, how, should, i, have, allowed, desire, to, dispose, of, my, heart, no, scruple, clouded, my, pleasure, and, no, remorse, followed, it, but, what, name, then, am, i, to, give, the, rapture, i, felt, as, i, clasped, in, my, naked, arms, that, perfect, little, body, so, wild, so, ardent, so, sombrely, lascivious, for, a, long, time, after, mohammed, had, left, me, i, remained, in, a, state, of, passionate, jubilation, and, though, i, had, already, achieved, pleasure, five, times, with, him, i, renewed, my, ecstasy, again, and, again, and, when, i, got, back, to, my, room, in, the, hotel, i, prolonged, its, echoes, until, morning, gide, s, novel, corydon, which, he, considered, his, most, important, work, includes, a, defense, of, pederasty, at, that, time, the, age, of, consent, for, any, type, of, sexual, activity, was, set, at, 13
