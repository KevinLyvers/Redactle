threefold, attack, on, the, swedish, protectorate, of, holstein, gottorp, and, provinces, of, livonia, and, ingria, aiming, to, draw, advantage, as, the, swedish, empire, was, unaligned, and, ruled, by, a, young, and, inexperienced, king, thus, initiating, the, great, northern, war, leading, the, swedish, army, against, the, alliance, charles, won, multiple, victories, despite, being, significantly, outnumbered, a, major, victory, over, a, russian, army, some, three, times, the, size, in, 1700, at, the, battle, of, narva, compelled, peter, the, great, to, sue, for, peace, an, offer, that, charles, subsequently, rejected, by, 1706, charles, now, 24, years, old, had, forced, all, of, his, foes, into, submission, including, in, that, year, a, decisively, devastating, victory, by, swedish, forces, under, general, carl, gustav, rehnski, ld, over, a, combined, army, of, saxony, and, russia, at, the, battle, of, fraustadt, russia, was, now, the, sole, remaining, hostile, power, charles, s, subsequent, march, on, moscow, met, with, initial, success, as, victory, followed, victory, the, most, significant, of, which, was, the, battle, of, holowczyn, where, the, smaller, swedish, army, routed, a, russian, army, twice, the, size, the, campaign, ended, with, disaster, when, the, swedish, army, suffered, heavy, losses, to, a, russian, force, more, than, twice, its, size, at, poltava, charles, had, been, incapacitated, by, a, wound, prior, to, the, battle, rendering, him, unable, to, take, command, the, defeat, was, followed, by, the, surrender, at, perevolochna, charles, spent, the, following, years, in, exile, in, the, ottoman, empire, before, returning, to, lead, an, assault, on, norway, trying, to, evict, the, danish, king, from, the, war, once, more, in, order, to, aim, all, his, forces, at, the, russians, two, campaigns, met, with, frustration, and, ultimate, failure, concluding, with, his, death, at, the, siege, of, fredriksten, in, 1718, at, the, time, most, of, the, swedish, empire, was, under, foreign, military, occupation, though, sweden, itself, was, still, free, this, situation, was, later, formalized, albeit, moderated, in, the, subsequent, treaty, of, nystad, the, result, was, the, end, of, the, swedish, empire, and, also, of, its, effectively, organized, absolute, monarchy, and, war, machine, commencing, a, parliamentary, government, unique, for, continental, europe, which, would, last, for, half, a, century, until, royal, autocracy, was, restored, by, gustav, iii, charles, was, an, exceptionally, skilled, military, leader, and, tactician, as, well, as, an, able, politician, credited, with, introducing, important, tax, and, legal, reforms, as, for, his, famous, reluctance, towards, peace, efforts, he, is, quoted, by, voltaire, as, saying, upon, the, outbreak, of, the, war, i, have, resolved, never, to, start, an, unjust, war, but, never, to, end, a, legitimate, one, except, by, defeating, my, enemies, with, the, war, consuming, more, than, half, his, life, and, nearly, all, his, reign, he, never, married, and, fathered, no, children, he, was, succeeded, by, his, sister, ulrika, eleonora, who, in, turn, was, coerced, to, hand, over, all, substantial, powers, to, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, and, opted, to, surrender, the, throne, to, her, husband, friedrich, of, hesse, kassel, who, became, king, frederick, i, of, sweden, his, title, in, full, as, the, king, of, sweden, was, as, follows, the, sovereign, and, supreme, lord, his, majesty, charles, xii, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, sweden, the, goths, and, the, wends, grand, prince, of, finland, duke, of, scania, estonia, livonia, karelia, bremen, and, verden, stettin, pomerania, rostock, of, kashubia, and, of, wenden, prince, of, r, gen, lord, of, ingeria, and, wismar, count, palatine, of, the, rhine, duke, in, bavaria, of, j, lich, cleves, and, berg, the, fact, that, charles, was, crowned, as, charles, xii, does, not, mean, that, he, was, the, 12th, king, of, sweden, by, that, name, swedish, kings, erik, xiv, 1560, 1568, and, charles, ix, 1604, 1611, gave, themselves, numerals, after, studying, a, mythological, history, of, sweden, he, was, actually, the, 6th, king, charles, around, 1700, the, monarchs, of, denmark, norway, saxony, ruled, by, elector, august, ii, of, poland, who, was, also, the, king, of, poland, lithuania, and, russia, united, in, an, alliance, against, sweden, mainly, through, the, efforts, of, johann, reinhold, patkul, a, livonian, nobleman, who, turned, traitor, when, the, great, reduction, of, charles, xi, in, 1680, stripped, much, of, the, nobility, of, lands, and, properties, in, late, 1699, charles, sent, a, minor, detachment, to, reinforce, his, brother, in, law, duke, frederick, iv, of, holstein, gottorp, who, was, attacked, by, danish, forces, the, following, year, a, saxon, army, simultaneously, invaded, swedish, livonia, and, in, february, 1700, surrounded, riga, the, most, populous, city, of, the, swedish, empire, russia, also, declared, war, august, 1700, but, stopped, short, of, an, attack, on, swedish, ingria, until, september, 1700, charles, s, first, campaign, was, against, denmark, norway, ruled, by, his, cousin, frederick, iv, of, denmark, for, this, campaign, charles, secured, the, support, of, england, and, the, netherlands, both, maritime, powers, concerned, with, denmark, s, threats, too, close, to, the, sound, leading, a, force, of, 8, 000, and, 43, ships, in, an, invasion, of, zealand, charles, rapidly, compelled, the, danes, to, submit, to, the, peace, of, travendal, in, august, 1700, which, indemnified, holstein, having, forced, denmark, norway, to, make, peace, within, months, king, charles, turned, his, attention, upon, the, two, other, powerful, neighbors, king, august, ii, cousin, to, both, charles, xii, and, frederick, iv, of, denmark, norway, and, peter, the, great, of, russia, who, also, had, entered, the, war, against, him, ironically, on, the, same, day, that, denmark, came, to, terms, russia, had, opened, their, part, of, the, war, by, invading, the, swedish, held, territories, of, livonia, and, estonia, charles, countered, this, by, attacking, the, russian, besiegers, at, the, battle, of, narva, november, 1700, the, russians, outnumbered, the, swedish, army, of, ten, thousand, men, by, almost, four, to, one, charles, attacked, under, cover, of, a, blizzard, effectively, splitting, the, russian, army, in, two, and, won, the, battle, many, of, peter, s, troops, who, fled, the, battlefield, drowned, in, the, narva, river, the, total, number, of, russian, fatalities, reached, about, 10, 000, at, the, end, of, the, battle, while, the, swedish, forces, lost, 667, men, charles, did, not, pursue, the, russian, army, instead, he, turned, against, poland, lithuania, which, was, formally, neutral, at, this, point, thereby, disregarding, polish, negotiation, proposals, supported, by, the, swedish, parliament, charles, defeated, the, polish, king, augustus, ii, and, his, saxon, allies, at, the, battle, of, kliszow, in, 1702, and, captured, many, cities, of, the, commonwealth, after, the, deposition, of, augustus, as, king, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, charles, xii, put, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, as, his, puppet, on, the, polish, throne, 1704, while, charles, won, several, decisive, battles, in, the, commonwealth, and, ultimately, secured, the, coronation, of, his, ally, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, and, the, surrender, of, saxony, the, russian, tsar, peter, the, great, embarked, on, a, military, reform, plan, that, improved, the, russian, army, using, the, effectively, organized, swedes, and, other, european, armies, as, role, models, russian, forces, managed, to, penetrate, ingria, where, they, established, a, new, city, saint, petersburg, charles, planned, an, invasion, of, the, russian, heartland, allying, himself, with, ivan, mazepa, hetman, of, the, ukrainian, cossacks, the, size, of, the, invading, swedish, army, was, peeled, off, as, charles, left, leszczy, ski, with, some, 24, 000, german, and, polish, troops, departing, eastwards, from, saxony, in, late, 1707, with, some, 35, 000, men, adding, a, further, 12, 500, under, adam, ludwig, lewenhaupt, marching, from, livonia, charles, left, the, homeland, with, a, defense, force, of, approximately, 28, 800, men, with, a, further, 14, 000, in, swedish, finland, as, well, as, other, garrisons, in, the, baltic, and, german, provinces, after, securing, his, favorite, victory, in, the, battle, of, holowczyn, despite, being, outnumbered, over, three, to, one, by, the, new, russian, army, charles, opted, to, march, eastwards, on, moscow, rather, than, try, to, seize, saint, petersburg, founded, from, the, swedish, town, of, nyenskans, five, years, earlier, peter, the, great, managed, however, to, ambush, lewenhaupt, s, army, at, lesnaya, before, charles, could, combine, his, forces, thus, losing, valuable, supplies, artillery, and, half, of, lewenhaupt, s, men, charles, polish, ally, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, was, facing, internal, problems, of, his, own, charles, expected, the, support, of, a, massive, cossack, rebellion, led, by, mazepa, in, ukraine, with, estimates, suggesting, mazepa, was, able, to, muster, about, 40, 000, troops, however, the, russians, subjugated, the, rebellion, and, destroyed, its, capital, baturin, before, the, arrival, of, the, swedish, troops, the, harsh, climate, took, its, toll, as, well, because, charles, marched, his, troops, to, winter, camp, in, ukraine, by, the, time, of, the, decisive, battle, of, poltava, in, july, 1709, charles, had, been, wounded, one, third, of, his, infantry, was, dead, and, his, supply, train, had, been, destroyed, the, king, was, incapacitated, by, a, gunshot, wound, to, the, foot, and, was, unable, to, lead, the, swedish, forces, with, the, numbers, of, charles, army, reduced, to, some, 23, 000, with, many, wounded, or, involved, on, the, siege, of, poltava, his, general, carl, gustav, rehnski, ld, had, a, clearly, inferior, force, to, face, the, fortified, and, modernized, army, of, tsar, peter, with, some, 45, 000, men, the, swedish, assault, ended, in, disaster, and, the, king, fled, south, to, the, ottoman, empire, with, a, small, entourage, and, set, up, camp, at, bender, with, some, 1, 000, of, his, caroleans, karoliner, in, swedish, the, remainder, of, the, army, surrendered, days, later, at, perevolochna, under, lewenhaupt, s, command, most, of, them, including, lewenhaupt, himself, spending, the, rest, of, their, days, in, russian, captivity, the, swedish, defeat, at, poltava, marked, the, downfall, of, the, swedish, empire, as, well, as, the, founding, of, the, russian, empire, the, ottomans, initially, welcomed, the, swedish, king, when, he, went, to, abdurrahman, pasha, commander, of, z, castle, as, he, was, about, to, fall, into, the, hands, of, the, russian, army, and, he, was, able, to, take, refuge, in, the, castle, at, the, last, moment, afterward, he, settled, in, bender, at, the, invitation, of, its, governor, a, a, yusuf, pasha, in, the, meantime, charles, sent, stanis, aw, poniatowski, and, thomas, funck, as, his, messengers, to, constantinople, they, managed, to, indirectly, contact, g, lnu, sultan, mother, of, sultan, ahmed, iii, who, became, intrigued, by, charles, and, took, an, interest, in, his, cause, and, even, corresponded, with, him, in, bender, his, expenses, during, his, long, stay, in, the, ottoman, empire, were, covered, by, the, ottoman, state, budget, as, part, of, the, fixed, assets, demirba, in, turkish, hence, his, nickname, demirba, arl, fixed, asset, charles, in, turkey, eventually, a, small, village, named, karlstad, varni, a, had, to, be, built, near, bender, to, accommodate, the, ever, growing, swedish, population, there, g, lnu, sultan, convinced, her, son, to, declare, war, against, russia, as, she, thought, that, charles, was, a, man, worth, taking, a, risk, for, later, on, the, ottomans, and, russians, signed, the, treaty, of, the, pruth, and, treaty, of, adrianople, to, end, the, hostilities, between, them, the, treaties, dissatisfied, the, pro, war, party, supported, by, king, charles, and, stanislaw, poniatowski, who, failed, to, reignite, the, conflict, however, the, sultan, ahmed, iii, s, subjects, in, the, empire, eventually, got, tired, of, charles, scheming, his, entourage, also, accumulated, huge, debts, with, bender, merchants, eventually, crowds, of, townspeople, attacked, the, swedish, colony, at, bender, and, charles, had, to, defend, himself, against, the, mobs, and, the, ottoman, janissaries, involved, this, uprising, was, called, kalabal, k, turkish, for, crowd, which, afterward, found, a, place, in, swedish, lexicon, referring, to, a, ruckus, the, janissaries, did, not, shoot, charles, during, the, skirmish, at, bender, but, captured, him, and, put, him, under, house, arrest, at, dimetoka, nowadays, didimoticho, and, constantinople, during, his, semi, imprisonment, the, king, played, chess, and, studied, the, ottoman, navy, and, the, naval, architecture, of, the, ottoman, galleons, his, sketches, and, designs, eventually, led, to, the, famous, swedish, war, ships, jarramas, yaramaz, and, jilderim, y, ld, r, m, meanwhile, russia, and, poland, regained, and, expanded, their, borders, great, britain, an, adversary, of, sweden, defected, from, its, alliance, obligations, while, prussia, attacked, swedish, holdings, in, germany, russia, occupied, finland, the, greater, wrath, 1713, 1721, after, defeats, of, the, swedish, army, consisting, mainly, of, finnish, troops, in, the, battle, of, helsinki, 1713, the, battle, of, p, lk, ne, 1713, and, the, battle, of, storkyro, 1714, the, military, administration, and, clergymen, escaped, from, finland, which, fell, under, russian, military, regime, during, his, five, year, stay, in, the, ottoman, empire, charles, xii, corresponded, with, his, sister, and, eventual, successor, ulrika, eleonora, according, to, mrs, ragnhild, marie, hatton, a, norwegian, british, historian, in, some, of, those, letters, charles, expressed, his, desire, for, a, peace, treaty, which, would, be, defensible, in, the, future, swedish, generations, eyes, however, he, emphasized, that, only, a, greater, respect, for, sweden, in, europe, would, enable, him, to, achieve, such, a, peace, treaty, meanwhile, the, swedish, council, of, state, government, and, estates, diet, parliament, tried, to, keep, the, beleaguered, sweden, somehow, organized, and, independent, eventually, in, the, autumn, of, 1714, their, warning, letter, reached, him, in, it, those, executive, and, legislative, bodies, told, the, absentee, king, that, unless, he, quickly, returned, to, sweden, they, would, independently, conclude, an, achievable, peace, treaty, with, russia, poland, and, denmark, this, stark, admonition, prompted, charles, to, rush, back, to, sweden, charles, traveled, back, to, sweden, with, a, group, of, ottomans, soldiers, such, as, escorts, and, businessmen, to, whom, he, promised, to, repay, his, debts, during, his, stay, in, the, ottoman, empire, but, they, had, to, wait, several, years, before, that, happened, according, to, the, prevailing, church, law, in, sweden, at, that, time, all, who, lived, in, the, country, but, were, not, members, of, the, swedish, state, church, would, be, baptized, in, order, for, the, jewish, and, muslim, creditors, to, avoid, this, charles, wrote, a, free, letter, so, that, they, could, practice, their, religions, without, being, punished, the, soldiers, chose, to, remain, in, sweden, instead, of, difficult, trips, home, they, were, called, askersson, the, word, asker, in, turkish, means, soldier, however, there, are, accounts, implying, that, following, the, long, stay, for, charles, to, repay, his, debts, they, got, paid, and, left, the, country, charles, agreed, to, leave, constantinople, and, returned, to, swedish, pomerania, he, made, the, journey, on, horseback, riding, across, europe, in, just, fifteen, days, he, traveled, across, the, habsburg, kingdom, of, hungary, to, vienna, and, arrived, at, stralsund, a, medal, with, charles, on, horseback, his, long, hair, flying, in, the, wind, was, struck, in, 1714, to, commemorate, the, speedy, ride, it, reads, was, sorget, ihr, doch, gott, und, ich, leben, noch, what, worries, you, so, god, and, i, live, still, after, five, years, away, charles, arrived, in, sweden, to, find, his, homeland, at, war, with, russia, saxony, hannover, great, britain, and, denmark, sweden, s, western, enemies, attacked, southern, and, western, sweden, while, russian, forces, traveled, across, finland, to, attack, the, stockholm, district, for, the, first, time, sweden, found, itself, in, a, defensive, war, charles, plan, was, to, attack, denmark, by, striking, at, her, possessions, in, norway, it, was, hoped, that, by, cutting, denmark, s, norwegian, supply, lines, the, danes, would, be, compelled, to, withdraw, their, forces, from, swedish, scania, charles, invaded, norway, in, 1716, with, a, combined, force, of, 7, 000, men, he, occupied, the, capital, of, christiania, modern, oslo, and, laid, siege, to, the, akershus, fortress, there, due, to, a, lack, of, heavy, siege, cannons, he, was, unable, to, dislodge, the, norwegian, forces, inside, after, suffering, significant, losses, of, men, and, materiel, charles, was, forced, to, retreat, from, the, capital, on, 29, april, in, the, following, mid, may, charles, invaded, again, this, time, striking, the, border, town, of, fredrikshald, now, halden, in, an, attempt, to, capture, the, fortress, of, fredriksten, the, attacking, swedes, came, under, heavy, cannon, fire, from, the, fortress, and, were, forced, to, withdraw, when, the, norwegians, set, the, town, of, fredrikshald, on, fire, swedish, casualties, in, fredrikshald, were, estimated, at, 500, men, while, the, siege, at, fredrikshald, was, underway, the, swedish, supply, fleet, was, attacked, and, defeated, by, tordenskjold, in, the, battle, of, dynekilen, in, 1718, charles, once, more, invaded, norway, with, a, main, force, of, 40, 000, men, he, again, laid, siege, to, the, fortress, of, fredriksten, overlooking, the, town, of, fredrikshald, charles, was, shot, in, the, head, and, killed, during, the, siege, while, he, was, inspecting, trenches, the, invasion, was, abandoned, and, charles, body, was, returned, to, sweden, a, second, force, under, carl, gustaf, armfeldt, marched, against, trondheim, with, 10, 000, men, but, was, forced, to, retreat, in, the, march, that, ensued, many, of, the, 5, 800, remaining, men, perished, in, a, severe, winter, storm, while, in, the, trenches, close, to, the, perimeter, of, the, fortress, on, 30, november, 11, december, new, style, 1718, charles, was, struck, in, the, head, by, a, projectile, and, killed, the, shot, struck, the, left, side, of, his, skull, and, exited, from, the, right, he, died, instantly, the, definitive, circumstances, around, charles, s, death, remain, unclear, despite, multiple, investigations, of, the, battlefield, charles, s, skull, and, his, clothes, it, is, not, known, where, and, when, he, was, hit, or, whether, the, shot, came, from, the, ranks, of, the, enemy, or, from, his, own, men, there, are, several, hypotheses, as, to, how, charles, died, though, none, have, strong, enough, evidence, to, be, deemed, true, although, there, were, many, people, around, the, king, at, the, time, of, his, death, there, were, no, known, witnesses, to, the, actual, moment, he, was, hit, a, likely, explanation, has, been, that, charles, was, killed, by, dano, norwegians, as, he, was, within, reach, of, their, guns, there, are, two, possibilities, that, are, usually, cited, that, he, was, killed, by, a, musket, shot, or, that, he, was, killed, by, grapeshot, from, the, nearby, fortress, more, theories, claim, he, was, assassinated, one, is, that, the, killer, was, a, swedish, compatriot, and, asserts, that, enemy, guns, were, not, firing, at, the, time, charles, was, struck, suspects, in, this, claim, range, from, a, nearby, soldier, tired, of, the, siege, and, wanting, to, put, an, end, to, the, war, to, an, assassin, hired, by, charles, s, own, brother, in, law, who, profited, from, the, event, by, subsequently, taking, the, throne, himself, as, frederick, i, of, sweden, that, person, being, frederick, s, aide, de, camp, andr, sicre, sicre, confessed, during, what, was, claimed, to, be, a, state, of, delirium, brought, on, by, fever, but, later, recanted, others, suspect, a, plot, to, kill, charles, by, a, group, of, wealthy, swedes, who, would, benefit, from, blocking, a, 17, wealth, tax, that, charles, intended, to, introduce, the, varberg, fortress, museum, displays, a, lead, filled, brass, button, of, swedish, origin, that, some, claim, was, the, projectile, that, killed, the, king, another, odd, account, of, charles, s, death, comes, from, finnish, writer, carl, nordling, who, states, that, the, king, s, surgeon, melchior, neumann, dreamed, the, king, had, told, him, that, he, was, not, shot, from, the, fortress, but, from, one, who, came, creeping, charles, s, body, has, been, exhumed, on, three, occasions, to, ascertain, the, cause, of, death, in, 1746, 1859, and, 1917, the, 1859, exhumation, found, that, the, wound, was, in, accordance, with, a, shot, from, the, norwegian, fort, in, 1917, his, head, was, photographed, and, x, rayed, peter, englund, asserted, in, his, essay, on, the, death, of, charles, xii, and, other, murders, that, the, mortal, wound, sustained, by, the, king, with, a, smaller, exit, wound, than, entry, wound, would, be, consistent, with, being, hit, by, a, bullet, with, a, speed, not, exceeding, 150, m, s, concluding, that, charles, was, killed, by, stray, grapeshot, from, the, nearby, fortress, a, 2022, study, also, found, that, iron, grapeshot, was, likely, to, have, killed, the, king, citing, evidence, from, ballistic, experiments, as, well, as, the, absence, of, lead, fragments, in, charles, s, skull, academic, research, from, university, of, oulu, and, university, of, helsinki, concluded, that, charles, xii, was, likely, killed, by, an, enemy, projectile, charles, was, succeeded, to, the, swedish, throne, by, his, sister, ulrika, eleonora, as, his, duchy, of, palatine, zweibr, cken, required, a, male, heir, charles, was, succeeded, as, ruler, there, by, his, cousin, gustav, leopold, georg, heinrich, von, g, rtz, charles, minister, was, beheaded, in, 1719, charles, never, married, and, fathered, no, children, of, whom, historians, are, aware, in, his, youth, he, was, particularly, encouraged, to, find, a, suitable, spouse, in, order, to, secure, the, succession, but, he, would, frequently, avoid, the, subject, of, sex, and, marriage, possible, candidates, included, princess, sophia, hedwig, of, denmark, louisa, maria, stuart, and, princess, maria, elisabeth, of, holstein, gottorp, but, of, the, latter, he, pleaded, that, he, could, never, wed, someone, as, ugly, as, satan, and, with, such, a, devilish, big, mouth, instead, he, made, it, clear, that, he, would, marry, only, someone, of, his, own, choice, and, for, love, rather, than, dynastic, pressures, his, lack, of, mistresses, may, have, been, due, to, a, strong, religious, faith, charles, himself, suggested, in, conversation, with, axel, l, wen, that, he, actively, resisted, any, match, until, peace, could, be, secured, and, was, in, some, sense, married, to, the, military, life, but, that, he, was, chaste, occasioned, speculation, in, his, lifetime, much, later, speculation, that, he, was, a, hermaphrodite, was,
