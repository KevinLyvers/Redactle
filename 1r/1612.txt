education, and, science, among, his, discoveries, were, the, atmosphere, of, venus, and, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, in, chemical, reactions, his, spheres, of, science, were, natural, science, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, history, art, philology, optical, devices, and, others, the, founder, of, modern, geology, lomonosov, was, also, a, poet, and, influenced, the, formation, of, the, modern, russian, literary, language, lomonosov, was, born, in, the, village, of, mishaninskaya, later, renamed, lomonosovo, in, his, honor, in, archangelgorod, governorate, on, an, island, not,

shubny, and, he, spent, every, spare, moment, with, his, books, he, continued, his, studies, with, the, village, deacon, s, n, sabelnikov, but, for, many, years, the, only, books, he, had, access, to, were, religious, texts, when, he, was, fourteen, lomonosov, was, given, copies, of, meletius, smotrytsky, s, modern, church, slavonic, a, grammar, book, and, leonty, magnitsky, s, arithmetic, lomonosov, was, a, russian, orthodox, all, his, life, but, had, close, encounters, with, old, believers, schism, in, early, youth, and, later, in, life, he, became, a, deist, in, 1724, his, father, married, for, the, third, and, final, time, lomonosov, and, his, stepmother, irina, had, an, acrimonious, relationship, unhappy, at, home, and, intent, on, obtaining, a, higher, education, which, lomonosov, could, not, receive, in, mishaninskaya, he, was, determined, to, leave, the, village, in, 1730, determined, to, study, sciences, the, 19, year, old, lomonosov, walked, all, the, way, to, moscow, shortly, after, arrival, he, was, admitted, into, the, slavic, greek, latin, academy, by, falsely, claiming, to, be, a, son, of, a, kholmogory, nobleman, in, 1734, that, initial, falsehood, as, well, as, another, lie, that, he, was, the, son, of, a, priest, nearly, got, him, expelled, from, the, academy, but, the, investigation, ended, without, severe, consequences, lomonosov, lived, on, three, kopecks, a, day, eating, only, black, bread, and, kvass, but, he, made, rapid, progress, scholastically, it, is, believed, that, in, 1735, after, three, years, in, moscow, he, was, sent, to, kyiv, to, study, for, short, period, at, the, kyiv, mohyla, academy, he, quickly, became, dissatisfied, with, the, education, he, was, receiving, there, and, returned, to, moscow, in, five, years, lomonosov, completed, a, twelve, year, study, course, and, in, 1736, among, 12, best, graduates, was, awarded, a, scholarship, at, the, st, petersburg, academy, he, plunged, into, his, studies, and, was, rewarded, with, a, four, year, grant, to, study, abroad, in, germany, first, at, the, university, of, marburg, and, then, in, freiberg, the, university, of, marburg, was, among, europe, s, most, important, universities, in, the, mid, 18th, century, due, to, the, presence, of, the, philosopher, christian, wolff, a, prominent, figure, of, the, german, enlightenment, lomonosov, became, one, of, wolff, s, students, while, at, marburg, from, november, 1736, to, july, 1739, both, philosophically, and, as, a, science, administrator, this, connection, would, be, the, most, influential, of, lomonosov, s, life, in, 1739, 1740, he, studied, mineralogy, and, philosophy, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, there, he, intensified, his, studies, of, german, literature, lomonosov, quickly, mastered, the, german, language, and, in, addition, to, philosophy, seriously, studied, chemistry, discovered, the, works, of, 17th, century, irish, theologian, and, natural, philosopher, robert, boyle, and, even, began, writing, poetry, he, also, developed, an, interest, in, german, literature, he, is, said, to, have, especially, admired, g, nther, his, ode, on, the, taking, of, khotin, from, the, turks, composed, in, 1739, attracted, a, great, deal, of, attention, in, saint, petersburg, contrary, to, his, adoration, for, wolff, lomonosov, had, fierce, disputes, with, henckel, over, the, training, and, education, courses, he, and, his, two, compatriot, students, were, getting, in, freiberg, as, well, as, over, very, limited, financial, support, which, henckel, was, instructed, to, provide, to, the, russians, after, numerous, debts, they, had, accumulated, in, marburg, as, the, result, lomonosov, left, freiberg, without, permission, and, wandered, for, quite, a, while, over, germany, and, holland, unsuccessfully, trying, to, obtain, permission, from, russian, envoys, to, return, to, the, st, petersburg, academy, during, his, residence, in, marburg, lomonosov, boarded, with, catharina, zilch, a, brewer, s, widow, he, fell, in, love, with, catharina, s, daughter, elizabeth, christine, zilch, they, were, married, in, june, 1740, lomonosov, found, it, extremely, difficult, to, maintain, his, growing, family, on, the, scanty, and, irregular, allowance, granted, him, by, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, as, his, circumstances, became, desperate, he, got, permission, to, return, to, saint, petersburg, lomonosov, returned, to, russia, in, june, 1741, after, being, abroad, 4, years, and, 8, months, a, year, later, he, was, named, an, adjunct, of, the, russian, academy, of, science, in, the, physics, department, in, may, 1743, lomonosov, was, accused, arrested, and, held, under, house, arrest, for, eight, months, after, he, supposedly, insulted, various, people, associated, with, the, academy, he, was, released, and, pardoned, in, january, 1744, after, apologising, to, all, involved, lomonosov, was, made, a, full, member, of, the, academy, and, named, professor, of, chemistry, in, 1745, he, established, the, academy, s, first, chemistry, laboratory, eager, to, improve, russia, s, educational, system, in, 1755, lomonosov, joined, his, patron, count, ivan, shuvalov, in, founding, moscow, university, in, 1760, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1764, he, was, elected, foreign, member, of, the, academy, of, sciences, of, the, institute, of, bologna, in, 1764, lomonosov, was, appointed, to, the, position, of, the, state, councillor, which, was, of, rank, v, in, the, russian, empire, s, table, of, ranks, he, died, on, 4, april, o, s, 1765, in, saint, petersburg, he, is, widely, and, deservingly, regarded, as, the, father, of, russian, science, though, many, of, his, scientific, accomplishments, were, relatively, unknown, outside, russia, until, long, after, his, death, and, gained, proper, appreciation, only, in, late, 19th, and, especially, 20th, centuries, in, 1756, lomonosov, tried, to, replicate, robert, boyle, s, experiment, of, 1673, he, concluded, that, the, commonly, accepted, phlogiston, theory, was, false, anticipating, the, discoveries, of, antoine, lavoisier, he, wrote, in, his, diary, today, i, made, an, experiment, in, hermetic, glass, vessels, in, order, to, determine, whether, the, mass, of, metals, increases, from, the, action, of, pure, heat, the, experiments, of, which, i, append, the, record, in, 13, pages, demonstrated, that, the, famous, robert, boyle, was, deluded, for, without, access, of, air, from, outside, the, mass, of, the, burnt, metal, remains, the, same, that, is, the, law, of, mass, conservation, in, chemical, reaction, which, is, well, known, today, as, in, a, chemical, reaction, the, mass, of, reactants, is, equal, to, the, mass, of, the, products, lomonosov, together, with, lavoisier, is, regarded, as, the, one, who, discovered, the, law, of, mass, conservation, he, stated, that, all, matter, is, composed, of, corpuscles, molecules, that, are, collections, of, elements, atoms, in, his, dissertation, elements, of, mathematical, chemistry, 1741, unfinished, the, scientist, gives, the, following, definition, an, element, is, a, part, of, a, body, that, does, not, consist, of, any, other, smaller, and, different, bodies, corpuscle, is, a, collection, of, elements, forming, one, small, mass, in, a, later, study, 1748, he, uses, the, term, atom, instead, of, element, and, particula, particle, or, molecule, instead, of, corpuscle, he, regarded, heat, as, a, form, of, motion, suggested, the, wave, theory, of, light, contributed, to, the, formulation, of, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, and, stated, the, idea, of, conservation, of, matter, in, the, following, words, all, changes, in, nature, are, such, that, inasmuch, is, taken, from, one, object, insomuch, is, added, to, another, so, if, the, amount, of, matter, decreases, in, one, place, it, increases, elsewhere, this, universal, law, of, nature, embraces, laws, of, motion, as, well, for, an, object, moving, others, by, its, own, force, in, fact, imparts, to, another, object, the, force, it, loses, first, articulated, in, a, letter, to, leonhard, euler, dated, 5, july, 1748, rephrased, and, published, in, lomonosov, s, dissertation, reflexion, on, the, solidity, and, fluidity, of, bodies, 1760, lomonosov, was, the, first, to, discover, and, appreciate, the, atmosphere, of, venus, during, his, observation, of, the, transit, of, venus, of, 1761, in, a, small, observatory, near, his, house, in, st, petersburg, at, least, in, the, english, speaking, world, this, attribution, seems, to, have, been, owing, to, comments, from, the, multi, lingual, popular, astronomy, writer, willy, ley, 1966, who, consulted, sources, in, both, russian, and, german, and, wrote, that, lomonosov, observed, a, luminous, ring, this, was, ley, s, interpretation, and, was, not, indicated, in, quotes, and, inferred, from, it, the, existence, of, an, atmosphere, maybe, greater, than, that, of, the, earth, which, was, in, quotes, because, many, modern, transit, observers, have, also, seen, a, threadlike, arc, produced, by, refraction, of, sunlight, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, when, the, planet, has, progressed, off, the, limb, of, the, sun, it, has, generally, if, rather, uncritically, been, assumed, that, this, was, the, same, thing, that, lomonosov, saw, indeed, the, term, lomonosov, s, arc, has, frequently, been, used, in, the, literature, in, 2012, pasachoff, and, sheehan, consulted, original, sources, and, questioned, the, basis, for, the, claim, that, lomonosov, observed, the, thin, arc, produced, by, the, atmosphere, of, venus, a, reference, to, the, paper, was, even, picked, up, by, the, russian, state, controlled, media, group, ria, novosti, on, 31, january, 2013, under, the, headline, astronomical, battle, in, us, over, lomonosov, s, discovery, an, attempt, was, made, by, a, group, of, researchers, to, experimentally, reconstruct, lomonosov, s, observation, using, antique, telescopes, during, the, transit, of, venus, on, 5, 6, june, 2012, one, of, them, y, petrunin, suggested, that, the, telescope, lomonosov, actually, used, was, probably, a, 50, mm, dollond, with, a, magnifying, power, of, 40x, it, was, preserved, at, pulkova, observatory, but, destroyed, when, the, germans, bombed, the, observatory, during, world, war, ii, thus, lomonosov, s, actual, telescope, was, not, available, but, other, presumably, similar, instruments, were, employed, on, this, occasion, and, led, the, researchers, to, affirm, their, belief, that, lomonosov, s, telescope, would, have, been, adequate, to, the, task, of, detecting, the, arc, thus, a, koukarine, using, a, 67, mm, dollond, on, mt, hamilton, where, seeing, was, likely, much, better, than, lomonosov, enjoyed, at, st, petersburg, clearly, observed, the, spiderweb, thin, arc, known, to, be, due, to, refraction, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, however, koukarine, s, sketches, do, not, really, resemble, the, diagram, published, by, lomonosov, koukarine, s, colleague, v, shiltsev, who, more, nearly, observed, under, the, same, conditions, as, lomonosov, using, a, 40, mm, dollond, at, batavia, illinois, produced, a, close, duplicate, of, lomonosov, s, diagram, however, the, rather, large, wing, of, light, shown, next, to, the, black, disk, of, venus, in, his, drawing, and, lomonosov, s, is, too, coarse, to, have, been, the, arc, instead, it, appears, to, be, a, complicated, manifestation, of, the, celebrated, optical, effect, known, as, the, black, drop, it, should, be, kept, in, mind, that, as, stated, in, sheehan, and, westfall, optical, distortions, at, the, interface, between, venus, and, the, sun, during, transits, are, impressively, large, and, any, inferences, from, them, are, fraught, with, peril, again, the, actual, words, used, by, lomonosov, do, not, refer, to, an, arc, at, all, in, the, russian, version, he, described, a, brief, brightening, lasting, a, second, or, so, just, before, third, contact, which, appeared, to, pasachoff, and, sheehan, to, most, probably, indicate, a, last, fleeting, glimpse, of, the, photosphere, as, a, check, against, this, lomonosov, s, german, version, he, had, learned, to, speak, and, write, german, fluently, as, a, student, at, marburg, was, also, consulted, he, describes, seeing, ein, ganz, helles, licht, wie, ein, haar, breit, a, very, bright, light, as, wide, as, a, hair, here, the, adverb, ganz, in, connection, with, helles, bright, could, mean, as, bright, as, possible, or, completely, bright, i, e, as, bright, as, the, surface, brightness, of, the, solar, disk, which, is, even, stronger, evidence, that, this, can, t, be, venus, s, atmosphere, which, always, appears, much, fainter, lomonosov, s, original, sketches, if, they, existed, do, not, appear, to, have, survived, modern, observations, made, during, the, nineteenth, century, transits, and, especially, those, of, 2004, and, 2012, suggest, that, what, lomonosov, saw, was, not, the, arc, associated, with, the, atmosphere, of, venus, at, all, but, the, bright, flash, of, the, solar, photosphere, before, third, contact, the, first, observers, to, record, the, actual, arc, associated, with, the, atmosphere, of, venus, in, a, form, comporting, with, modern, observations, appear, to, have, been, chappe, rittenhouse, wayles, and, dymond, and, several, others, at, the, transit, in, june, 1769, in, 1762, lomonosov, presented, an, improved, design, of, a, reflecting, telescope, to, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, forum, his, telescope, had, its, primary, mirror, adjusted, at, an, angle, of, four, degrees, to, the, telescope, s, axis, this, made, the, image, focus, at, the, side, of, the, telescope, tube, where, the, observer, could, view, the, image, with, an, eyepiece, without, blocking, the, image, this, invention, was, not, published, until, 1827, so, this, type, of, telescope, has, become, associated, with, a, similar, design, by, william, herschel, the, herschelian, telescope, in, 1759, with, his, collaborator, academician, joseph, adam, braun, lomonosov, was, the, first, person, to, record, the, freezing, of, mercury, and, to, carry, out, initial, experiments, with, it, believing, that, nature, is, subject, to, regular, and, continuous, evolution, he, demonstrated, the, organic, origin, of, soil, peat, coal, petroleum, and, amber, in, 1745, he, published, a, catalogue, of, over, 3, 000, minerals, and, in, 1760, he, explained, the, formation, of, icebergs, in, 1763, he, published, on, the, strata, of, the, earth, his, most, significant, geological, work, this, work, puts, him, before, james, hutton, who, has, been, traditionally, regarded, as, the, founder, of, modern, geology, lomonosov, based, his, conceptions, on, the, unity, of, the, earth, s, processes, in, time, and, necessity, to, explain, the, planet, s, past, from, present, lomonosov, s, observation, of, iceberg, formation, led, into, his, pioneering, work, in, geography, lomonosov, got, close, to, the, theory, of, continental, drift, theoretically, predicted, the, existence, of, antarctica, he, argued, that, icebergs, of, the, southern, ocean, could, be, formed, only, on, a, dry, land, covered, with, ice, and, invented, sea, tools, which, made, writing, and, calculating, directions, and, distances, easier, in, 1764, he, organized, an, expedition, led, by, admiral, vasili, chichagov, to, find, the, northeast, passage, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, by, sailing, along, the, northern, coast, of, siberia, the, idea, of, a, coaxial, rotor, originated, from, mikhail, lomonosov, in, july, 1754, he, developed, a, model, of, a, small, helicopter, with, a, coaxial, rotor, and, demonstrated, it, to, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, lomonosov, was, proud, to, restore, the, ancient, art, of, mosaics, in, 1754, in, his, letter, to, leonhard, euler, he, wrote, that, his, three, years, of, experiments, on, the, effects, of, chemistry, of, minerals, on, their, colour, led, to, his, deep, involvement, in, the, mosaic, art, in, 1763, he, set, up, a, glass, factory, that, produced, the, first, stained, glass, mosaics, outside, of, italy, there, were, forty, mosaics, attributed, to, lomonosov, with, only, twenty, four, surviving, to, the, present, day, among, the, best, is, the, portrait, of, peter, the, great, and, the, battle, of, poltava, measuring, 4, 8, by, 6, 4, metres, 16, ft, 21, ft, in, 1755, lomonosov, wrote, a, grammar, that, reformed, the, russian, literary, language, by, combining, church, slavonic, with, the, vernacular, tongue, to, further, his, literary, theories, he, wrote, more, than, 20, solemn, ceremonial, odes, notably, the, evening, meditation, on, god, s, grandeur, he, applied, an, idiosyncratic, theory, to, his, later, poems, tender, subjects, needed, words, containing, the, front, vowel, sounds, e, i, y, and, u, whereas, things, that, may, cause, fear, like, anger, envy, pain, and, sorrow, needed, words, with, back, vowel, sounds, o, u, and, y, that, was, a, version, of, what, is, now, called, sound, symbolism, in, 1760, lomonosov, published, a, history, of, russia, in, addition, he, attempted, to, write, a, grand, aeneid, inspired, epic, about, peter, the, great, but, he, died, before, he, could, finish, it, his, granddaughter, sophia, konstantinova, 1769, 1844, married, russian, military, hero, and, statesman, general, nikolay, raevsky, his, great, granddaughter, was, princess, maria, raevskaya, volkonskaya, the, wife, of, the, decembrist, prince, sergei, volkonsky, the, city, of,

named, mikhailo, lomonosov, after, him, the, imperial, porcelain, factory, saint, petersburg, was, renamed, after, him, from, 1925, to, 2005, in, 1948, the, underwater, lomonosov, ridge, in, the, arctic, ocean, was, named, in, his, honor, lomonosov, bridge, in, saint, petersburg, was, named, after, the, polymath, originally, called, tchernyshov, bridge, chernyshev, bridge, in, honour, of, count, grigory, tchernyshov, chernyshev, one, of, peter, the, great, s, most, prominent, generals, whose, estates, were, located, nearby, the, bridge, was, erected, in, 1785, 1987, and, replaced, a, wooden, bridge, which, had, previously, stood, at, the, site, it, was, one, of, seven, moveable, stone, bridges, of, similar, design, crossing, the, fontanka, river, built, simultaneously, with, the, river, s, granite, embankments, only, lomonosov, bridge, and, staro, kalinkin, bridge, have, survived, more, or, less, intact, moscow, s, domodedovo, airport, is, officially, named, after, lomonosov,
