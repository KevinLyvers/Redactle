success, at, the, chantilly, tournament, prompted, her, father, to, train, her, more, seriously, he, studied, the, leading, male, and, female, players, and, decided, to, teach, lenglen, the, tactics, from, the, men, s, game, which, were, more, aggressive, than, the, women, s, style, of, slowly, constructing, points, from, the, baseline, when, the, family, returned, to, nice, towards, the, end, of, autumn, her, father, arranged, for, her, to, play, twice, a, week, at, the, nice, lawn, tennis, club, even, though, children, had, never, been, allowed, on, the, courts, and, had, her, practise, with, leading, male, players, at, the, club, lenglen, began, training, with, joseph, negro, the, club, s, teaching, professional, negro, had, a, wide, variety, of, shots, in, his, repertoire, and, trained, lenglen, to, play, the, same, way, as, lenglen, s, primary, coach, her, father, employed, harsh, and, rigorous, methods, saying, i, was, a, hard, taskmaster, and, although, my, advice, was, always,

throughout, showing, restraint, in, their, criticisms, only, when, she, was, sick, as, a, result, lenglen, became, comfortable, with, appearing, ill, which, made, it, difficult, for, others, to, tell, if, she, was, sick, lenglen, entered, her, first, non, handicap, singles, event, in, july, 1912, at, the, compi, gne, championships, near, her, hometown, her, only, regular, event, of, the, year, she,

on, regular, events, her, victory, in, singles, against, the, high, ranking, british, player, ruth, winch, was, regarded, as, a, huge, surprise, by, the, tennis, community, however, lenglen, still,

of, the, year, lenglen, led, france, to, a, 7, 4, victory, in, a, tie, against, australia, and, defeated, australasian, champion, daphne, akhurst, in, the, final, of, the, concurrent, deauville, tournament, later, in, the, year, lenglen, won, the, doubles, and, mixed, doubles, events, at, the, cromer, covered, courts, the, only, time, she, played, in, england, other, than, wimbledon, and, her, only, indoor, wood, tournament, the, 1926, season, unexpectedly, was, lenglen, s, last, as, an, amateur, at, the, beginning, of, the, season, three, time, reigning, u, s, national, champion, helen, wills, travelled, to, the, french, riviera, with, the, hope, of, playing, a, match, against, lenglen, with, wills, s, level, of, stardom, approaching, that, of, lenglen, s, there, was, an, immense, amount, of, hype, for, a, match, between, them, to, take, place, they, entered, the, same, singles, draw, only, once, at, the, carlton, club, in, cannes, when, lenglen, and, wills, both, made, the, final, with, little, opposition, the, club, doubled, the, number, of, seats, around, their, main, court, and, all, three, thousand, seats, plus, standing, room, sold, out, spectators, unable, to, get, into, the, venue, attempted, to, watch, the, match, by, climbing, trees, and, ladders, or, by, purchasing, unofficial, tickets, for, the, windows, and, roofs, of, villas, across, the, street, in, what, was, called, the, match, of, the, century, lenglen, defeated, wills, in, straight, sets, the, first, match, point, became, chaotic, when, a, winner, from, wills, was, called, out, by, a, spectator, leading, everyone, but, the, officials, to, believe, the, match, was, over, photographers, captured, the, moment, as, the, players, shook, hands, at, the, net, and, the, crowd, began, flooding, the, court, after, clarification, that, the, shot, had, been, in, wills, broke, lenglen, to, level, the, set, despite, lenglen, s, winning, her, reputation, of, being, unbeatable, was, damaged, by, wills, s, competitive, performance, while, wills, remained, in, france, lenglen, avoided, a, rematch, on, the, riviera, after, wills, s, season, was, marred, by, an, appendectomy, during, the, french, championships, she, withdrew, from, both, grand, slam, tournaments, in, europe, and, another, match, between, her, and, lenglen, never, took, place, in, wills, s, absence, lenglen, defended, all, three, of, her, titles, at, the, french, championships, with, ease, defeating, mary, browne, in, the, singles, final, she, again, won, the, doubles, with, vlasto, and, the, mixed, doubles, with, brugnon, although, lenglen, was, a, heavy, favourite, at, wimbledon, with, wills, not, participating, she, began, the, tournament, facing, two, issues, she, was, concerned, with, her, family, s, finances, as, her, father, s, health, was, worsening, and, she, was, not, content, with, the, fflt, wanting, her, to, enter, the, doubles, event, with, a, french, partner, instead, of, her, usual, partner, ryan, although, lenglen, agreed, to, play, with, vlasto, as, the, fflt, wanted, she, was, unsettled, by, being, drawn, against, ryan, in, her, opening, doubles, match, lenglen, s, situation, did, not, improve, once, the, tournament, began, she, opened, the, singles, event, with, an, uncharacteristic, win, against, browne, in, which, she, lost, five, games, the, same, number, she, had, lost, in, the, entire, 1925, singles, event, her, next, singles, match, was, then, moved, before, her, doubles, match, to, accommodate, the, royal, family, who, planned, to, be, in, attendance, wanting, to, play, doubles, first, lenglen, asked, for, the, match, to, be, rescheduled, although, the, request, was, never, received, she, arrived, at, the, grounds, late, after, wimbledon, officials, confronted, her, in, anger, over, keeping, queen, mary, waiting, she, refused, to, play, the, club, ultimately, adhered, to, lenglen, s, wishes, and, rescheduled, both, matches, with, the, doubles, first, nonetheless, lenglen, and, vlasto, were, defeated, by, ryan, and, browne, in, three, sets, while, the, crowd, who, typically, supported, lenglen, turned, against, her, although, she, defeated, evelyn, dewhurst, in, the, rescheduled, singles, match, she, then, withdrew, from, both, singles, and, mixed, doubles, ending, her, last, amateur, tournament, a, month, after, her, withdrawal, from, wimbledon, lenglen, signed, a, 50, 000, contract, equivalent, to, about, 860, 000, in, 2020, with, american, sports, promoter, c, c, pyle, to, headline, a, four, month, professional, tour, in, the, united, states, beginning, in, october, 1926, she, had, begun, discussing, a, professional, contract, with, pyle, s, associate, william, pickens, when, he, visited, her, on, the, riviera, in, april, lenglen, had, previously, turned, down, an, offer, of, 200, 000, francs, equivalent, to, about, 130, 000, in, 2020, to, turn, professional, in, the, united, states, following, her, last, victory, over, molla, mallory, in, 1923, declining, in, large, part, to, keep, her, amateur, status, she, became, less, concerned, with, that, however, after, the, crowd, turned, against, her, at, wimbledon, she, was, more, interested, in, keeping, her, social, status, and, was, convinced, by, pyle, that, turning, professional, would, not, hurt, her, stardom, or, damage, her, reputation, with, lenglen, on, the, tour, pyle, attempted, to, recruit, other, top, players, including, wills, mckane, and, leading, americans, bill, tilden, and, bill, johnston, although, they, all, declined, pyle, was, able, to, sign, mary, browne, as, well, as, men, s, players, vincent, richards, paul, f, ret, howard, kinsey, and, harvey, snodgrass, richards, was, regarded, as, the, biggest, star, among, the, male, players, having, won, gold, medals, in, singles, and, doubles, at, the, 1924, olympics, once, the, tour, began, lenglen, and, all, of, the, other, players, lost, their,

33, of, the, best, of, three, set, matches, played, to, completion, browne, did, not, win, a, set, until, the, second, set, at, the, 33rd, stop, the, only, other, set, she, won, was, the, only, set, they, played, at, the, 36th, stop, where, lenglen, had, decided, to, play, just, a, one, set, match, while, ill, to, avoid, disappointing, the, fans, browne, also, nearly, won, a, set, at, the, 23rd, stop, losing, 9, 11, at, which, point, lenglen, decided, not, to, continue, the, tour, was, a, financial, success, lenglen, earned, the, most, money, receiving, half, of, the, revenue, from, ticket, sales, and, 100, 000, in, total, more, than, the, 70, 000, that, babe, ruth, earned, in, 1927, as, the, highest, paid, player, in, major, league, baseball, the, average, attendance, was, just, over, four, thousand, at, the, 34, venues, where, it, was, recorded, the, most, well, attended, venues, were, opening, night, at, madison, square, garden, in, new, york, city, with, an, attendance, of, thirteen, thousand, and, the, public, auditorium, in, cleveland, with, an, attendance, of, ten, thousand, opening, night, in, particular, brought, in, 34, 000, from, tickets, sold, at, 1, 50, to, 5, 50, equivalent, to, 26, to, 95, in, 2020, a, few, months, after, the, end, of, the, united, states, tour, lenglen, signed, with, british, promoter, charles, cochran, to, headline, a, shorter, professional, tour, in, the, united, kingdom, cochran, recruited, dora, k, ring, the, 1912, olympic, silver, medalist, in, singles, and, dewhurst, to, play, against, lenglen, karel, ko, eluh, and, kinsey, were, the, male, players, on, the, tour, there, were, seven, tour, stops, all, in, july, 1927, lenglen, won, all, seven, of, her, singles, matches, never, losing, more, than, five, games, in, any, of, them, the, last, three, stops, were, played, on, the, grounds, of, association, football, clubs, queen, s, park, in, glasgow, blackpool, and, manchester, united, these, were, the, best, attended, events, on, the, tour, and, the, final, match, at, old, trafford, had, an, attendance, of, over, fifteen, thousand, the, highest, between, either, professional, tour, lenglen, was, widely, criticised, for, her, decision, to, turn, professional, once, the, tour, began, the, fflt, expelled, her, and, f, ret, while, the, all, england, lawn, tennis, club, revoked, her, membership, lenglen, in, turn, criticised, amateur, tennis, for, her, nearing, poverty, in, the, program, for, the, united, states, professional, tour, she, stated, in, the, twelve, years, i, have, been, champion, i, have, earned, literally, millions, of, francs, for, tennis, and, in, my, whole, lifetime, i, have, not, earned, 5, 000, not, one, cent, of, that, by, my, specialty, my, life, study, tennis, i, am, twenty, seven, and, not, wealthy, should, i, embark, on, any, other, career, and, leave, the, one, for, which, i, have, what, people, call, genius, or, should, i, smile, at, the, prospect, of, actual, poverty, and, continue, to, earn, a, fortune, for, whom, she, criticised, the, barriers, that, typically, prevented, ordinary, people, from, becoming, tennis, players, stating, under, these, absurd, and, antiquated, amateur, rulings, only, a, wealthy, person, can, compete, and, the, fact, of, the, matter, is, that, only, wealthy, people, do, compete, is, that, fair, does, it, advance, the, sport, lenglen, did, not, participate, in, any, other, professional, tours, after, 1927, she, never, formally, applied, to, be, reinstated, as, an, amateur, with, the, fflt, either, she, had, asked, about, the, possibility, in, 1932, after, f, ret, was, reinstated, but, was, told, to, wait, another, three, years, and, decided, against, it, molla, mallory, was, the, only, player, to, defeat, lenglen, in, singles, after, world, war, i, fifteen, years, older, than, lenglen, and, originally, from, norway, mallory, won, a, bronze, medal, at, the, 1912, olympic, games, before, emigrating, to, the, united, states, in, 1914, while, world, war, i, halted, tennis, in, europe, mallory, established, herself, as, the, top, ranked, american, player, winning, the, first, four, u, s, national, championships, she, entered, from, 1915, through, 1918, whereas, lenglen, regularly, came, to, the, net, and, had, an, all, court, game, built, around, control, rather, than, power, the, much, older, mallory, played, almost, exclusively, from, the, baseline, the, strengths, of, mallory, s, game, were, that, she, took, the, ball, early, and, had, one, of, the, most, powerful, forehands, in, women, s, tennis, at, the, time, mallory, had, a, similar, personality, to, lenglen, off, the, court, while, they, each, hated, losing, both, of, them, smoked, regularly, and, loved, to, dance, lenglen, faced, mallory, just, four, times, in, singles, compiling, a, 3, 1, record, she, also, won, both, of, their, doubles, and, mixed, doubles, encounters, their, first, two, meetings, were, highlighted, by, lenglen, s, health, issues, in, the, final, of, the, 1921, world, hard, court, championships, lenglen, nearly, retired, while, struggling, with, blisters, on, her, foot, and, trailing, in, the, second, set, nonetheless, lenglen, proceeded, to, win, by, following, her, plan, to, play, defensively, and, wait, for, mallory, to, make, unforced, errors, on, attempted, winners, in, their, second, meeting, at, the, 1921, u, s, national, championships, mallory, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, lenglen, s, poor, health, executing, her, usual, strategy, of, going, for, winners, to, win, the, match, although, they, had, entered, the, doubles, event, as, partners, lenglen, s, health, prevented, them, from, playing, any, matches, together, at, the, tournament, lenglen, was, able, to, easily, win, their, last, two, meetings, in, 1922, and, 1923, by, playing, more, aggressively, and, employing, mallory, s, strategy, of, hitting, well, placed, winners, from, the, baseline, the, press, built, the, rivalry, between, lenglen, and, mallory, after, lenglen, s, retirement, against, mallory, at, the, u, s, national, championships, the, vast, majority, of, american, newspapers, criticised, lenglen, for, not, finishing, the, match, and, accused, her, of, retiring, because, she, did, not, think, she, could, win, they, coined, a, phrase, cough, and, quit, that, became, popular, at, the, time, for, describing, someone, who, needed, an, excuse, to, avoid, losing, after, lenglen, s, victory, over, mallory, at, wimbledon, the, american, press, returned, to, supporting, lenglen, both, lenglen, and, mallory, believed, the, newspapers, exaggerated, the, personal, nature, of, their, rivalry, mallory, in, particular, said, the, newspapers, are, the, dirtiest, filthiest, things, that, ever, happened, i, don, t, want, my, name, in, the, newspapers, i, have, a, better, chance, on, the, courts, than, in, the, newspapers, of, my, own, country, lenglen, s, usual, doubles, partner, elizabeth, ryan, was, also, her, most, frequent, opponent, in, singles, born, in, the, united, states, ryan, travelled, to, england, in, 1912, to, visit, her, sister, before, deciding, to, stay, there, permanently, although, she, lost, all, four, of, her, appearances, in, major, finals, ryan, won, 26, major, titles, between, doubles, and, mixed, doubles, the, biggest, strength, of, her, game, was, volleying, tennis, writer, ted, tinling, said, volleying, as, a, fundamental, aggressive, technique, was, first, injected, into, the, women, s, game, by, ryan, lenglen, and, ryan, first, partnered, together, at, a, handicap, event, in, monte, carlo, in, 1913, when, they, were, 13, and, 20, years, old, respectively, after, losing, the, final, at, that, tournament, the, two, of, them, never, lost, a, regular, doubles, match, only, once, dropping, a, set, in, 1923, to, dorothea, lambert, chambers, and, kathleen, mckane, again, at, monte, carlo, ryan, was, lenglen, s, doubles, partner, for, 40, of, her, 74, doubles, titles, including, all, six, at, wimbledon, and, two, of, three, at, the, world, hard, court, championships, ryan, defeated, lenglen, in, their, first, singles, meeting, in, straight, sets, at, monte, carlo, in, 1914, and, also, won, a, set, in, their, second, meeting, two, months, later, following, their, first, encounter, lenglen, won, all, 17, of, their, remaining, matches, including, five, at, wimbledon, and, two, major, finals, the, only, time, ryan, won, a, set, against, lenglen, after, world, war, i, was, in, the, quarterfinals, at, wimbledon, in, 1924, where, lenglen, withdrew, due, to, illness, in, the, following, round, when, the, fflt, asked, lenglen, to, take, a, french, partner, in, doubles, at, wimbledon, in, 1926, ryan, partnered, with, mary, browne, to, defeat, lenglen, and, her, new, partner, julie, vlasto, coming, from, three, match, points, down, in, the, second, set, ryan, also, won, their, only, other, doubles, meeting, in, 1914, in, mixed, doubles, lenglen, compiled, a, 23, 9, record, against, ryan, half, of, her, career, mixed, doubles, losses, were, to, ryan, after, losing, their, first, six, encounters, she, recovered, to, win, the, next, thirteen, lenglen, won, her, first, mixed, doubles, match, against, ryan, at, the, 1920, beaulieu, tournament, starting, a, win, streak, that, ended, with, a, loss, to, ryan, and, lycett, at, the, 1923, south, of, france, championships, helen, wills, was, the, closest, to, becoming, lenglen, s, counterpart, wills, finished, her, career, with, 19, grand, slam, singles, titles, a, record, that, stood, until, 1970, she, succeeded, lenglen, as, world, no, 1, in, 1927, and, kept, that, ranking, for, the, next, six, years, and, nine, of, the, next, twelve, overall, until, 1938, late, in, lenglen, s, amateur, career, wills, had, built, a, similar, level, of, stardom, to, lenglen, by, winning, the, 1924, olympic, gold, medal, in, singles, in, lenglen, s, absence, while, still, only, 18, years, old, although, their, careers, overlapped, when, wills, visited, europe, in, 1924, and, 1926, lenglen, faced, wills, only, once, in, her, career, lenglen, withdrew, from, wimbledon, and, the, olympics, due, to, jaundice, in, 1924, and, wills, withdrew, from, the, french, championships, and, wimbledon, in, 1926, due, to, appendicitis, preventing, a, longer, rivalry, between, tennis, s, two, biggest, female, stars, of, the, 1920s, from, emerging, describing, lenglen, s, all, court, style, of, play, elizabeth, ryan, said, owned, every, kind, of, shot, plus, a, genius, for, knowing, how, and, when, to, use, them, she, never, gave, an, opponent, the, same, kind, of, shot, twice, in, a, row, she, d, make, you, run, miles, her, game, was, all, placement, and, deception, and, steadiness, i, had, the, best, drop, shot, anybody, ever, had, but, she, could, not, only, get, up, to, it, but, was, so, fast, that, often, she, could, score, a, placement, off, it, her, rivals, molla, mallory, and, helen, wills, both, noted, that, lenglen, excelled, at, extending, rallies, and, could, take, control, of, points, with, defensive, shots, although, lenglen, built, her, game, around, control, rather, than, power, she, had, the, ability, to, hit, powerful, shots, in, particular, mallory, praised, the, power, behind, her, defensive, shots, saying, she, is, just, the, steadiest, player, that, ever, was, she, just, sent, back, at, me, whatever, i, sent, at, her, and, waited, for, me, to, make, a, fault, and, her, returns, often, enough, were, harder, than, the, shots, i, sent, up, to, her, british, journalist, a, e, crawley, regarded, her, as, having, the, best, movement, of, her, time, saying, i, have, never, seen, on, a, lawn, tennis, court, either, man, or, woman, move, with, such, mechanical, and, artistic, perfection, and, poise, whether, objective, is, the, ball, or, merely, changing, sides, she, reminded, you, of, the, movement, of, fire, over, prairie, grass, he, believed, she, was, a, powerful, server, and, an, aggressive, volleyer, commenting, she, serves, with, all, the, male, athlete, s, power, she, smashes, with, the, same, loose, and, rapid, action, the, release, of, a, spring, of, steel, her, volley, is, not, a, timid, push, but, an, arrow, from, the, bow, and, an, arrow, from, the, bow, is, suzanne, herself, adopting, a, style, of, play, drawn, from, men, s, players, led, lenglen, to, become, one, of, the, leading, volleyers, in, women, s, tennis, at, a, time, when, the, women, s, game, was, centred, around, playing, from, the, baseline, even, for, the, top, players, lenglen, aimed, to, come, to, the, net, to, finish, points, quickly, whenever, possible, kathleen, mckane, specifically, noted, that, suzanne, volleyed, like, a, man, when, describing, her, influence, on, women, s, tennis, while, lenglen, did, not, model, the, majority, of, her, game, after, any, specific, player, she, modelled, her, forehand, after, that, of, anthony, wilding, like, wilding, she, aimed, to, hit, forehands, flat, and, with, little, to, no, topspin, she, used, a, continental, grip, and, strived, to, hit, balls, early, on, the, rise, lenglen, wrote, in, her, book, lawn, tennis, for, girls, a, favorite, shot, of, mine, is, the, backhand, down, the, line, lenglen, was, regarded, as, having, a, graceful, style, of, play, her, movement, was, thought, to, resemble, that, of, a, dancer, a, style, that, may, have, arisen, from, a, course, on, classic, greek, dance, she, had, taken,

games, that, i, understood, what, harmony, was, concealed, by, her, simplicity, what, wonderful, mental, and, physical, balance, was, hidden, by, the, facility, of, her, play, lenglen, developed, a, reputation, for, drinking, cognac, to, help, her, play, at, pivotal, points, of, her, biggest, matches, most, notably, she, did, so, during, the, second, and, third, sets, of, her, victory, against, lambert, chambers, in, the, 1919, wimbledon, final, and, at, the, start, and, during, the, more, competitive, second, set, of, her, victory, over, helen, wills, in, the, match, of, the, century, she, travelled, to, the, u, s, national, championships, in, 1921, only, after, the, uslta, agreed, to, supply, her, with, alcohol, during, her, stay, even, though, its, sale, was, illegal, under, the,

in, 1925, and, 1926, when, the, tournament, was, open, to, internationals, following, world, war, i, lenglen, became, a, symbol, of, national, pride, in, france, in, a, country, looking, to, recover, from, the, war, the, french, press, referred, to, lenglen, as, notre, suzanne, our, suzanne, to, characterise, her, status, as, a, national, heroine, and, more, eminently, as, la, divine, the, goddess, to, assert, her, unassailability, the, press, wrote, about, lenglen, as, if, she, were, infallible, at, tennis, often, attributing, any, performance, that, was, relatively, poor, by, her, standards, to, various, excuses, such, as, the, fault, of, her, doubles, partner, or, to, having, concern, over, the, health, of, her, father, journalists, who, criticised, lenglen, were, condemned, and, refuted, by, the, rest, of, the, press, at, the, olympics, she, introduced, herself, to, journalists, as, the, great, lenglen, a, title, that, was, well, received, before, matches, lenglen, would, predict, to, the, press, that, she, was, going, to, win, a, practice, that, americans, treated, as, improper, she, explained, when, i, am, asked, a, question, i, endeavour, to, give, a, frank, answer, if, i, know, i, am, going, to, win, what, harm, is, there, in, saying, so, lenglen, was, the, first, female, athlete, to, be, acknowledged, as, a, celebrity, outside, of, her, sport, she, was,

factor, in, the, club, moving, the, tournament, from, worple, road, to, its, modern, site, at, church, road, a, new, centre, court, opened, in, 1922, with, a, seating, capacity, of, nearly, ten,

the, men, s, singles, final, at, the, u, s, national, championships, at, the, time, which, were, sold, at, as, low, as, 2, per, seat, about, 30, in, 2020, lenglen, s, mythical, reputation, began, at, a, young, age, she, was, known, for, a, story, about, her, father, training, her, to, improve, her, shot, precision, as, a, child, by, placing, a, handkerchief, at, different, locations, on, the, court, and, instructing, her, to, hit, it, as, a, target, she, was, said, to, be, able, to, hit, the, handkerchief, with, ease, regardless, of, the, type, of, incoming, shot, each, time, she, did, he, would, fold, it, in, half, before, replacing, it, with, a, coin, it, was, said, that, lenglen, could, hit, the, coin, up, to, five, times, in, a, row, lenglen, was, the, first, leading, tennis,

playing, career, ended, the, next, significant, exhibition, tour, to, feature, women, s, tennis, players, did, not, occur, until, 1941, when, alice, marble, became, one, of, the, headliners, on, a,

her, skirt, extended, only, to, her, knees, lenglen, replaced, the, bonnet, with, a, bandeau, which, became, known, as, the, lenglen, bandeau, and, was, her, signature, piece, of, attire, throughout, the, rest, of, her, career, on, the, court, she, routinely, wore, makeup, and, popularised, having, tanned, skin, instead, of, a, pale, complexion, that, other, players, had, preferred, before, her,
