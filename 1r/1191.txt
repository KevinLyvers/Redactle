of, aragon, he, received, that, kingdom, in, vassalage, and, crowned, him, king, at, rome, in, 1204, the, muslim, recapture, of, jerusalem, in, 1187, was, to, him, a, divine, judgment, on, the, moral, lapses, of, christian, princes, he, was, also, determined, to, protect, what, he, called, the, liberty, of, the, church, from, inroads, by, secular, princes, this, determination, meant, among, other, things, that, princes, should, not, be, involved, in, the, selection, of, bishops, and, it, was, focused, especially, on, the, patrimonium, of, the, papacy, the, section, of, central, italy, claimed, by, the, popes, and, later, called, the, papal, states, the, patrimonium, was, routinely, threatened, by, hohenstaufen, german, kings, who, as, roman, emperors, claimed, it, for, themselves, emperor, henry, vi, expected, his, infant, son, frederick, to, bring, germany, italy, and, sicily, under, a, single, ruler, which, would, leave, the, papal, states, exceedingly, vulnerable, henry, s, early, death, left, his, 3, year, old, son, frederick, as, king, of, sicily, henry, vi, s, widow, constance, of, sicily, ruled, over, sicily, for, her, young, son, before, he, reached, the, age, of, majority, she, was, as, eager, to, remove, german, power, from, the, kingdom, of, sicily, as, was, innocent, iii, before, her, death, in, 1198, she, named, innocent, as, guardian, of, the, young, frederick, until, he, reached, his, maturity, in, exchange, innocent, was, also, able, to, recover, papal, rights, in, sicily, that, had, been, surrendered, decades, earlier, to, king, william, i, of, sicily, by, pope, adrian, iv, the, pope, invested, the, young, frederick, ii, as, king, of, sicily, in, november, 1198, he, also, later, induced, frederick, ii, to, marry, constance, of, aragon, the, widow, of, king, emeric, of, hungary, in, 1209, innocent, was, concerned, that, the, marriage, of, henry, vi, and, constance, of, sicily, gave, the, hohenstaufens, a, claim, to, all, the, italian, peninsula, with, the, exception, of, the, papal, states, which, would, be, surrounded, by, imperial, territory, after, the, death, of, emperor, henry, vi, who, had, recently, also, conquered, the, kingdom, of, sicily, the, succession, became, disputed, as, henry, s, son, frederick, was, still, a, small, child, the, partisans, of, the, staufen, dynasty, elected, henry, s, brother, philip, duke, of, swabia, king, in, march, 1198, whereas, the, princes, opposed, to, the, staufen, dynasty, elected, otto, duke, of, brunswick, of, the, house, of, welf, king, philip, ii, of, france, supported, philip, s, claim, whereas, king, richard, i, of, england, supported, his, nephew, otto, in, 1201, the, pope, openly, espoused, the, side, of, otto, iv, whose, family, had, always, been, opposed, to, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, it, is, the, business, of, the, pope, to, look, after, the, interests, of, the, roman, empire, since, the, empire, derives, its, origin, and, its, final, authority, from, the, papacy, its, origin, because, it, was, originally, transferred, from, greece, by, and, for, the, sake, of, the, papacy, its, final, authority, because, the, emperor, is, raised, to, his, position, by, the, pope, who, blesses, him, crowns, him, and, invests, him, with, the, empire, therefore, since, three, persons, have, lately, been, elected, king, by, different, parties, namely, the, youth, philip, and, otto, so, also, three, things, must, be, taken, into, account, in, regard, to, each, one, namely, the, legality, the, suitability, and, the, expediency, of, his, election, far, be, it, from, us, that, we, should, defer, to, man, rather, than, to, god, or, that, we, should, fear, the, countenance, of, the, powerful, on, the, foregoing, grounds, then, we, decide, that, the, youth, should, not, at, present, be, given, the, empire, we, utterly, reject, philip, for, his, manifest, unfitness, and, we, order, his, usurpation, to, be, resisted, by, all, since, otto, is, not, only, himself, devoted, to, the, church, but, comes, from, devout, ancestors, on, both, sides, therefore, we, decree, that, he, ought, to, be, accepted, and, supported, as, king, and, ought, to, be, given, the, crown, of, empire, after, the, rights, of, the, roman, church, have, been, secured, papal, decree, on, the, choice, of, a, german, king, 1201, the, confusion, in, the, empire, allowed, innocent, to, drive, out, the, imperial, feudal, lords, from, ancona, spoleto, and, perugia, who, had, been, installed, by, emperor, henry, vi, on, 3, july, 1201, the, papal, legate, cardinal, bishop, guido, of, palestrina, announced, to, the, people, in, the, cathedral, of, cologne, that, otto, iv, had, been, approved, by, the, pope, as, roman, king, and, threatened, with, excommunication, all, those, who, refused, to, acknowledge, him, at, the, same, time, innocent, encouraged, the, cities, in, tuscany, to, form, a, league, called, the, league, of, san, genesio, against, german, imperial, interests, in, italy, and, they, placed, themselves, under, innocent, s, protection, in, may, 1202, innocent, issued, the, decree, venerabilem, addressed, to, the, duke, of, z, hringen, in, which, he, explained, his, thinking, on, the, relation, between, the, papacy, and, the, empire, this, decree, was, afterwards, embodied, in, the, corpus, juris, canonici, and, contained, the, following, items, despite, papal, support, otto, could, not, oust, his, rival, philip, before, the, latter, was, murdered, in, a, private, feud, his, rule, now, undisputed, otto, reneged, on, his, earlier, promises, and, set, his, sights, on, reestablishing, imperial, power, in, italy, and, claiming, even, the, kingdom, of, sicily, given, the, papal, interest, to, keep, germany, and, sicily, apart, innocent, now, supported, his, ward, king, frederick, of, sicily, to, resist, otto, s, advances, and, restore, the, staufen, dynasty, to, the, holy, roman, empire, frederick, was, duly, elected, by, the, staufen, partisans, the, conflict, was, decided, by, the, battle, of, bouvines, on, 27, july, 1214, which, pitted, otto, allied, to, king, john, of, england, against, philip, ii, augustus, otto, was, defeated, by, the, french, and, thereafter, lost, all, influence, he, died, on, 19, may, 1218, leaving, frederick, ii, the, undisputed, emperor, meanwhile, king, john, was, forced, to, acknowledge, the, pope, as, his, feudal, lord, and, accept, stephen, langton, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, his, turn, frederick, ii, would, later, become, a, bitter, opponent, of, the, papacy, once, his, empire, was, secure, innocent, iii, played, further, roles, in, the, politics, of, norway, france, sweden, bulgaria, spain, and, england, at, the, request, of, england, s, king, john, pope, innocent, iii, declared, magna, carta, annulled, which, resulted, in, a, rebellion, by, the, english, barons, who, rejected, the, disenfranchisement, pope, innocent, iii, spent, a, majority, of, his, tenure, as, pope, 1198, 1216, preparing, for, a, great, crusade, on, the, holy, land, his, first, attempt, was, the, fourth, crusade, 1202, 1204, which, he, decreed, by, the, papal, bull, post, miserabile, in, 1198, unlike, past, popes, innocent, iii, displayed, interest, in, leading, the, crusade, himself, rather, than, simply, instigating, it, and, allowing, secular, leaders, to, organize, the, expedition, according, to, their, own, aspirations, innocent, iii, s, first, order, of, business, in, preaching, the, crusade, was, to, send, missionaries, to, every, catholic, state, to, endorse, the, campaign, he, sent, peter, of, capua, to, the, kings, of, france, and, england, with, specific, instructions, to, convince, them, to, settle, their, differences, resulting, in, a, truce, of, five, years, between, the, two, nations, beginning, in, 1199, the, intent, of, the, truce, was, not, to, allow, the, two, kings, to, lead, the, crusade, but, rather, to, free, their, resources, to, assist, the, crusade, for, the, army, s, leadership, innocent, aimed, his, pleas, at, the, knights, and, nobles, of, europe, succeeding, in, france, where, many, lords, answered, the, pope, s, call, including, the, army, s, two, eventual, leaders, theobald, of, champagne, and, boniface, marquis, of, montferrat, the, pope, s, calls, to, action, were, not, received, with, as, much, enthusiasm, in, england, or, germany, and, the, expedition, became, mainly, a, french, affair, the, fourth, crusade, was, an, expensive, endeavor, innocent, iii, chose, to, raise, funds, with, a, new, approach, requiring, all, clergy, to, donate, one, fortieth, of, their, income, this, marked, the, first, time, a, pope, ever, imposed, a, direct, tax, on, the, clergy, he, faced, many, difficulties, in, collecting, this, tax, including, corrupt, tax, collectors, and, disregard, in, england, he, also, sent, envoys, to, king, john, of, england, and, king, philip, of, france, who, pledged, to, contribute, to, the, campaign, and, john, also, declared, his, support, for, the, clerical, tax, in, his, kingdom, the, crusaders, too, contributed, funds, innocent, declared, that, those, who, took, the, crusader, s, vow, but, could, no, longer, fulfill, it, could, be, released, by, a, contribution, of, funds, the, pope, put, archbishop, hubert, walter, in, charge, of, collecting, these, dues, at, the, onset, of, the, crusade, the, intended, destination, was, egypt, as, the, christians, and, muslims, were, under, a, truce, at, the, time, an, agreement, was, made, between, the, french, crusaders, and, the, venetians, the, venetians, would, supply, vessels, and, supplies, for, the, crusaders, and, in, return, the, crusaders, would, pay, 85, 000, marks, 200, 000, innocent, gave, his, approval, of, this, agreement, under, two, conditions, a, representative, of, the, pope, must, accompany, the, crusade, and, the, attack, on, any, other, christians, was, strictly, forbidden, the, french, failed, to, raise, sufficient, funds, for, payment, of, the, venetians, as, a, result, the, crusaders, diverted, the, crusade, to, the, christian, dalmatian, city, of, zadar, in, 1202, at, the, will, of, the, venetian, enrico, dandolo, to, subsidize, the, debt, this, diversion, was, adopted, without, the, consent, of, innocent, iii, who, threatened, excommunication, to, any, who, took, part, in, the, attack, a, majority, of, the, french, ignored, the, threat, and, attacked, zadar, and, were, excommunicated, by, innocent, iii, but, soon, were, forgiven, so, as, to, continue, the, crusade, a, second, diversion, then, occurred, when, the, crusaders, decided, to, conquer, constantinople, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, empire, at, the, behest, of, the, exiled, byzantine, prince, alexios, iv, this, diversion, was, taken, without, any, knowledge, by, innocent, iii, and, he, did, not, learn, of, it, until, after, the, city, had, been, plundered, innocent, iii, was, heavily, opposed, to, the, attack, on, constantinople, and, sent, many, letters, warning, the, crusaders, to, not, sack, the, city, he, excommunicated, the, crusaders, who, attacked, byzantine, cities, but, was, unable, to, physically, halt, or, overturn, their, actions, one, of, the, pope, s, goals, had, been, to, persuade, alexios, iii, uncle, of, the, exiled, prince, alexios, iv, to, participate, in, the, crusade, the, attack, on, constantinople, led, to, the, start, of, the, latin, empire, s, rule, of, constantinople, which, lasted, for, the, next, sixty, years, pope, innocent, iii, was, also, a, zealous, protector, of, the, catholic, faith, and, a, strenuous, opponent, of, heresy, his, chief, activity, was, turned, against, the, albigenses, whose, expansion, he, viewed, as, a, mortal, threat, to, catholicism, they, were, especially, numerous, in, a, few, cities, of, northern, and, southern, france, during, the, first, year, of, his, pontificate, innocent, sent, the, two, cistercian, monks, rainer, and, guido, to, the, albigenses, in, france, to, preach, to, them, the, true, doctrines, of, the, catholic, faith, and, dispute, with, them, on, controverted, topics, of, religion, the, two, cistercian, missionaries, were, soon, followed, by, diego, bishop, of, osma, then, by, saint, dominic, and, the, two, papal, legates, peter, of, castelnau, and, raoul, when, however, these, missionaries, were, ridiculed, and, despised, by, the, albigenses, and, the, papal, legate, castelnau, was, assassinated, in, 1208, innocent, resorted, to, force, he, ordered, the, bishops, of, southern, france, to, put, under, interdict, the, participants, in, the, murder, and, all, the, towns, that, gave, shelter, to, them, he, was, especially, incensed, against, count, raymond, of, toulouse, who, had, previously, been, excommunicated, by, the, murdered, legate, and, whom, the, pope, suspected, as, the, instigator, of, the, murder, the, count, protested, his, innocence, and, submitted, to, the, pope, but, the, pope, placed, no, further, trust, in, him, he, called, upon, the, king, of, france, philip, ii, to, raise, an, army, for, the, suppression, of, the, albigenses, under, the, leadership, of, simon, of, montfort, a, cruel, campaign, ensued, against, the, albigenses, which, despite, the, protest, of, innocent, soon, turned, into, a, war, of, conquest, during, the, siege, of, b, ziers, the, leader, of, the, crusader, assault, famously, declared, upon, being, asked, how, to, distinguish, cathars, from, catholics, at, the, besieged, town, caedite, eos, novit, enim, dominus, qui, sunt, eius, which, translates, as, slay, them, all, god, will, recognize, his, own, this, statement, is, often, cited, as, kill, them, all, and, let, god, sort, them, out, the, albigensian, crusade, led, to, the, deaths, of, approximately, 20, 000, men, women, and, children, cathar, and, catholic, alike, decimating, the, number, of, practising, cathars, and, diminishing, the, region, s, distinct, culture, the, conflict, took, on, a, political, flavor, directed, not, only, against, the, heretics, but, also, the, nobility, of, toulouse, and, vassals, of, the, crown, of, aragon, and, finally, brought, the, region, firmly, under, the, control, of, the, king, of, france, king, peter, ii, of, aragon, count, of, barcelona, was, directly, involved, in, the, conflict, and, was, killed, in, the, course, of, the, battle, of, muret, in, 1213, the, conflict, largely, ended, with, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1229, in, which, the, integration, of, the, occitan, territory, in, the, french, crown, was, agreed, upon, in, 1209, francis, of, assisi, led, his, first, eleven, followers, to, rome, to, seek, permission, from, pope, innocent, iii, to, found, a, new, religious, order, which, was, ultimately, granted, upon, entry, to, rome, the, brothers, encountered, bishop, guido, of, assisi, who, had, in, his, company, giovanni, di, san, paolo, the, cardinal, bishop, of, sabina, the, cardinal, who, was, the, confessor, of, pope, innocent, iii, was, immediately, sympathetic, to, francis, and, agreed, to, represent, francis, to, the, pope, reluctantly, pope, innocent, agreed, to, meet, with, francis, and, the, brothers, the, next, day, after, several, days, the, pope, agreed, to, admit, the, group, informally, adding, that, when, god, increased, the, group, in, grace, and, number, they, could, return, for, an, official, admittance, the, group, was, tonsured, this, was, important, in, part, because, it, recognized, church, authority, and, protected, his, followers, from, possible, accusations, of, heresy, as, had, happened, to, the, waldensians, decades, earlier, though, pope, innocent, initially, had, his, doubts, following, a, dream, in, which, he, saw, francis, holding, up, the, basilica, of, st, john, lateran, the, cathedral, of, rome, thus, the, home, church, of, all, christendom, he, decided, to, endorse, francis, s, order, this, occurred, according, to, tradition, on, 16, april, 1210, and, constituted, the, official, founding, of, the, franciscan, order, the, group, then, the, lesser, brothers, order, of, friars, minor,

marry, them, ignorant, of, who, they, are, canon, 69, forbade, that, jews, be, given, preferment, in, public, office, since, this, offers, them, the, pretext, to, vent, their, wrath, against, the, christians, it, assumes, that, jews, blaspheme, christ, and, therefore, as, it, would, be, too, absurd, for, a, blasphemer, of, christ, to, exercise, power, over, christians, jews, should, not, be, appointed, to, public, offices, the, council, had, set, the, beginning, of, the, fifth, crusade, for, 1217, under, the, direct, leadership, of, the, church, after, the, council, in, the, spring, of,
