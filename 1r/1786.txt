george, boole, jnr, b, u, l, 2, november, 1815, 8, december, 1864, was, a, largely, self, taught, english, mathematician, philosopher, and, logician, most, of, whose, short, career, was, spent, as, the, first, professor, of, mathematics, at, queen, s, college, cork, in, ireland, he, worked, in, the, fields, of, differential, equations, and, algebraic, logic, and, is, best, known, as, the, author, of, the, laws, of, thought, 1854, which, contains, boolean, algebra, boolean, logic, essential, to, computer, programming, is, credited, with, laying, the, foundations, for, the, information, age, alongside, the, work, of, claude, shannon, boole, was, the, son, of, a, shoemaker, he, received, a, primary, school, education, and, learned, latin, and, modern, languages, through, various, means, at, 16, he, began, teaching, to, support, his, family, he, established, his, own, school, at, 19, and, later, ran, a, boarding, school, in, lincoln, boole, was, an, active, member, of, local, societies, and, collaborated, with, fellow, mathematicians, in, 1849, boole, was, appointed, the, first, professor, of, mathematics, at, queen, s, college, cork, now, university, college, cork, in, ireland, where, he, met, his, future, wife, mary, everest, he, continued, his, involvement, in, social, causes, and, maintained, connections, with, lincoln, in, 1864, boole, died, due, to, fever, induced, pleural, effusion, after, developing, pneumonia, boole, published, around, 50, articles, and, several, separate, publications, in, his, lifetime, some, of, his, key, works, include, a, paper, on, early, invariant, theory, and, the, mathematical, analysis, of, logic, which, introduced, symbolic, logic, boole, also, wrote, two, systematic, treatises, treatise, on, differential, equations, and, treatise, on, the, calculus, of, finite, differences, he, contributed, to, the, theory, of, linear, differential, equations, and, the, study, of, the, sum, of, residues, of, a, rational, function, in, 1847, boole, developed, boolean, algebra, a, fundamental, concept, in, binary, logic, which, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, algebra, of, logic, tradition, and, forms, the, foundation, of, digital, circuit, design, and, modern, computer, science, boole, also, attempted, to, discover, a, general, method, in, probabilities, focusing, on, determining, the, consequent, probability, of, events, logically, connected, to, given, probabilities, his, work, was, expanded, upon, by, various, scholars, such, as, charles, sanders, peirce, and, william, stanley, jevons, boole, s, ideas, later, gained, practical, applications, when, claude, shannon, and, victor, shestakov, employed, boolean, algebra, to, optimize, the, design, of, electromechanical, relay, systems, leading, to, the, development, of, modern, electronic, digital, computers, university, college, cork, celebrated, the, 200th, anniversary, of, boole, s, birth, in, 2015, highlighting, his, significant, impact, on, the, digital, age, boole, s, contributions, to, mathematics, earned, him, various, honors, including, the, royal, society, s, first, gold, prize, for, mathematics, the, keith, medal, and, honorary, degrees, from, the, universities, of, dublin, and, oxford, boole, was, born, in, 1815, in, lincoln, lincolnshire, england, the, son, of, john, boole, snr, 1779, 1848, a, shoemaker, and, mary, ann, joyce, he, had, a, primary, school, education, and, received, lessons, from, his, father, but, due, to, a, serious, decline, in, business, he, had, little, further, formal, and, academic, teaching, william, brooke, a, bookseller, in, lincoln, may, have, helped, him, with, latin, which, he, may, also, have, learned, at, the, school, of, thomas, bainbridge, he, was, self, taught, in, modern, languages, in, fact, when, a, local, newspaper, printed, his, translation, of, a, latin, poem, a, scholar, accused, him, of, plagiarism, under, the, pretence, that, he, was, not, capable, of, such, achievements, at, age, 16, boole, became, the, breadwinner, for, his, parents, and, three, younger, siblings, taking, up, a, junior, teaching, position, in, doncaster, at, heigham, s, school, he, taught, briefly, in, liverpool, boole, participated, in, the, lincoln, mechanics, institute, in, the, greyfriars, lincoln, which, was, founded, in, 1833, edward, bromhead, who, knew, john, boole, through, the, institution, helped, george, boole, with, mathematics, books, and, he, was, given, the, calculus, text, of, sylvestre, fran, ois, lacroix, by, the, rev, george, stevens, dickson, of, st, swithin, s, lincoln, without, a, teacher, it, took, him, many, years, to, master, calculus, at, age, 19, boole, successfully, established, his, own, school, in, lincoln, free, school, lane, four, years, later, he, took, over, hall, s, academy, in, waddington, outside, lincoln, following, the, death, of, robert, hall, in, 1840, he, moved, back, to, lincoln, where, he, ran, a, boarding, school, boole, immediately, became, involved, in, the, lincoln, topographical, society, serving, as, a, member, of, the, committee, and, presenting, a, paper, entitled, on, the, origin, progress, and, tendencies, of, polytheism, especially, amongst, the, ancient, egyptians, and, persians, and, in, modern, india, boole, became, a, prominent, local, figure, an, admirer, of, john, kaye, the, bishop, he, took, part, in, the, local, campaign, for, early, closing, with, edmund, larken, and, others, he, set, up, a, building, society, in, 1847, he, associated, also, with, the, chartist, thomas, cooper, whose, wife, was, a, relation, from, 1838, onwards, boole, was, making, contacts, with, sympathetic, british, academic, mathematicians, and, reading, more, widely, he, studied, algebra, in, the, form, of, symbolic, methods, as, far, as, these, were, understood, at, the, time, and, began, to, publish, research, papers, boole, s, status, as, a, mathematician, was, recognised, by, his, appointment, in, 1849, as, the, first, professor, of, mathematics, at, queen, s, college, cork, now, university, college, cork, ucc, in, ireland, he, met, his, future, wife, mary, everest, there, in, 1850, while, she, was, visiting, her, uncle, john, ryall, who, was, professor, of, greek, they, married, in, 1855, he, maintained, his, ties, with, lincoln, working, there, with, e, r, larken, in, a, campaign, to, reduce, prostitution, in, 1861, boole, was, involved, in, a, judgement, in, the, court, of, queen, s, bench, in, ireland, against, one, john, hewitt, wheatley, of, craig, house, sligo, for, the, sum, of, 400, whereby, wheatley, s, estate, and, interest, in, lands, of, maghan, mahon, county, cork, became, vested, in, boole, in, march, 1863, boole, leased, litchfield, cottage, cork, the, house, in, which, he, would, live, with, his, wife, mary, until, his, death, in, december, of, the, following, year, the, premises, was, described, in, the, deeds, as, all, that, and, those, the, dwelling, house, called, litchfield, cottage, with, the, premises, and, appurtenances, thereunto, belonging, and, the, garden, and, walled, in, field, to, the, rere, thereof, boole, s, will, bequeathed, all, his, estate, term, and, interest, in, the, lease, of, litchfield, cottage, unto, his, wife, in, august, 1865, some, 8, months, after, his, death, mary, by, then, living, at, 68, harley, street, london, passed, the, house, on, to, francis, heard, of, ballintemple, cork, esquire, a, captain, in, her, majesty, s, 87th, regiment, of, south, cork, in, 1844, boole, s, paper, on, a, general, method, in, analysis, won, the, first, gold, prize, for, mathematics, awarded, by, the, royal, society, he, was, awarded, the, keith, medal, by, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, 1855, and, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1857, he, received, honorary, degrees, of, ll, d, from, the, university, of, dublin, and, the, university, of, oxford, boole, s, first, published, paper, was, researches, in, the, theory, of, analytical, transformations, with, a, special, application, to, the, reduction, of, the, general, equation, of, the, second, order, printed, in, the, cambridge, mathematical, journal, in, february, 1840, volume, 2, no, 8, pp, 64, 73, and, it, led, to, a, friendship, between, boole, and, duncan, farquharson, gregory, the, editor, of, the, journal, his, works, are, in, about, 50, articles, and, a, few, separate, publications, in, 1841, boole, published, an, influential, paper, in, early, invariant, theory, he, received, a, medal, from, the, royal, society, for, his, memoir, of, 1844, on, a, general, method, in, analysis, it, was, a, contribution, to, the, theory, of, linear, differential, equations, moving, from, the, case, of, constant, coefficients, on, which, he, had, already, published, to, variable, coefficients, the, innovation, in, operational, methods, is, to, admit, that, operations, may, not, commute, in, 1847, boole, published, the, mathematical, analysis, of, logic, the, first, of, his, works, on, symbolic, logic, boole, completed, two, systematic, treatises, on, mathematical, subjects, during, his, lifetime, the, treatise, on, differential, equations, appeared, in, 1859, and, was, followed, the, next, year, by, a, treatise, on, the, calculus, of, finite, differences, a, sequel, to, the, former, work, in, 1857, boole, published, the, treatise, on, the, comparison, of, transcendent, with, certain, applications, to, the, theory, of, definite, integrals, in, which, he, studied, the, sum, of, residues, of, a, rational, function, among, other, results, he, proved, what, is, now, called, boole, s, identity, for, any, real, numbers, a, k, 0, b, k, and, t, 0, generalisations, of, this, identity, play, an, important, role, in, the, theory, of, the, hilbert, transform, in, 1847, boole, published, the, pamphlet, mathematical, analysis, of, logic, he, later, regarded, it, as, a, flawed, exposition, of, his, logical, system, and, wanted, an, investigation, of, the, laws, of, thought, on, which, are, founded, the, mathematical, theories, of, logic, and, probabilities, to, be, seen, as, the, mature, statement, of, his, views, contrary, to, widespread, belief, boole, never, intended, to, criticise, or, disagree, with, the, main, principles, of, aristotle, s, logic, rather, he, intended, to, systematise, it, to, provide, it, with, a, foundation, and, to, extend, its, range, of, applicability, boole, s, initial, involvement, in, logic, was, prompted, by, a, current, debate, on, quantification, between, sir, william, hamilton, who, supported, the, theory, of, quantification, of, the, predicate, and, boole, s, supporter, augustus, de, morgan, who, advanced, a, version, of, de, morgan, duality, as, it, is, now, called, boole, s, approach, was, ultimately, much, further, reaching, than, either, sides, in, the, controversy, it, founded, what, was, first, known, as, the, algebra, of, logic, tradition, among, his, many, innovations, is, his, principle, of, wholistic, reference, which, was, later, and, probably, independently, adopted, by, gottlob, frege, and, by, logicians, who, subscribe, to, standard, first, order, logic, a, 2003, article, provides, a, systematic, comparison, and, critical, evaluation, of, aristotelian, logic, and, boolean, logic, it, also, reveals, the, centrality, of, holistic, reference, in, boole, s, philosophy, of, logic, in, every, discourse, whether, of, the, mind, conversing, with, its, own, thoughts, or, of, the, individual, in, his, intercourse, with, others, there, is, an, assumed, or, expressed, limit, within, which, the, subjects, of, its, operation, are, confined, the, most, unfettered, discourse, is, that, in, which, the, words, we, use, are, understood, in, the, widest, possible, application, and, for, them, the, limits, of, discourse, are, co, extensive, with, those, of, the, universe, itself, but, more, usually, we, confine, ourselves, to, a, less, spacious, field, sometimes, in, discoursing, of, men, we, imply, without, expressing, the, limitation, that, it, is, of, men, only, under, certain, circumstances, and, conditions, that, we, speak, as, of, civilised, men, or, of, men, in, the, vigour, of, life, or, of, men, under, some, other, condition, or, relation, now, whatever, may, be, the, extent, of, the, field, within, which, all, the, objects, of, our, discourse, are, found, that, field, may, properly, be, termed, the, universe, of, discourse, furthermore, this, universe, of, discourse, is, in, the, strictest, sense, the, ultimate, subject, of, the, discourse, boole, conceived, of, elective, symbols, of, his, kind, as, an, algebraic, structure, but, this, general, concept, was, not, available, to, him, he, did, not, have, the, segregation, standard, in, abstract, algebra, of, postulated, axiomatic, properties, of, operations, and, deduced, properties, his, work, was, a, beginning, to, the, algebra, of, sets, again, not, a, concept, available, to, boole, as, a, familiar, model, his, pioneering, efforts, encountered, specific, difficulties, and, the, treatment, of, addition, was, an, obvious, difficulty, in, the, early, days, boole, replaced, the, operation, of, multiplication, by, the, word, and, and, addition, by, the, word, or, but, in, boole, s, original, system, was, a, partial, operation, in, the, language, of, set, theory, it, would, correspond, only, to, disjoint, union, of, subsets, later, authors, changed, the, interpretation, commonly, reading, it, as, exclusive, or, or, in, set, theory, terms, symmetric, difference, this, step, means, that, addition, is, always, defined, in, fact, there, is, the, other, possibility, that, should, be, read, as, disjunction, this, other, possibility, extends, from, the, disjoint, union, case, where, exclusive, or, and, non, exclusive, or, both, give, the, same, answer, handling, this, ambiguity, was, an, early, problem, of, the, theory, reflecting, the, modern, use, of, both, boolean, rings, and, boolean, algebras, which, are, simply, different, aspects, of, one, type, of, structure, boole, and, jevons, struggled, over, just, this, issue, in, 1863, in, the, form, of, the, correct, evaluation, of, x, x, jevons, argued, for, the, result, x, which, is, correct, for, as, disjunction, boole, kept, the, result, as, something, undefined, he, argued, against, the, result, 0, which, is, correct, for, exclusive, or, because, he, saw, the, equation, x, x, 0, as, implying, x, 0, a, false, analogy, with, ordinary, algebra, the, second, part, of, the, laws, of, thought, contained, a, corresponding, attempt, to, discover, a, general, method, in, probabilities, here, the, goal, was, algorithmic, from, the, given, probabilities, of, any, system, of, events, to, determine, the, consequent, probability, of, any, other, event, logically, connected, with, those, events, in, late, november, 1864, boole, walked, in, heavy, rain, from, his, home, at, lichfield, cottage, in, ballintemple, to, the, university, a, distance, of, three, miles, and, lectured, wearing, his, wet, clothes, he, soon, became, ill, developing, pneumonia, as, his, wife, believed, that, remedies, should, resemble, their, cause, she, wrapped, him, in, wet, blankets, the, wet, having, brought, on, his, illness, boole, s, condition, worsened, and, on, 8, december, 1864, he, died, of, fever, induced, pleural, effusion, he, was, buried, in, the, church, of, ireland, cemetery, of, st, michael, s, church, road, blackrock, a, suburb, of, cork, there, is, a, commemorative, plaque, inside, the, adjoining, church, boole, is, the, namesake, of, the, branch, of, algebra, known, as, boolean, algebra, as, well, as, the, namesake, of, the, lunar, crater, boole, the, keyword, bool, represents, a, boolean, data, type, in, many, programming, languages, though, pascal, and, java, among, others, both, use, the, full, name, boolean, the, library, underground, lecture, theatre, complex, and, the, boole, centre, for, research, in, informatics, at, university, college, cork, are, named, in, his, honour, a, road, called, boole, heights, in, bracknell, berkshire, is, named, after, him, boole, s, work, was, extended, and, refined, by, a, number, of, writers, beginning, with, william, stanley, jevons, who, also, authored, the, article, about, boole, in, the, encyclopaedia, britannica, augustus, de, morgan, had, worked, on, the, logic, of, relations, and, charles, sanders, peirce, integrated, his, work, with, boole, s, during, the, 1870s, other, significant, figures, were, platon, sergeevich, poretskii, and, william, ernest, johnson, the, conception, of, a, boolean, algebra, structure, on, equivalent, statements, of, a, propositional, calculus, is, credited, to, hugh, maccoll, 1877, in, work, surveyed, 15, years, later, by, johnson, surveys, of, these, developments, were, published, by, ernst, schr, der, louis, couturat, and, clarence, irving, lewis, in, 1921, the, economist, john, maynard, keynes, published, a, book, on, probability, theory, a, treatise, of, probability, keynes, believed, that, boole, had, made, a, fundamental, error, in, his, definition, of, independence, which, vitiated, much, of, his, analysis, in, his, book, the, last, challenge, problem, david, miller, provides, a, general, method, in, accord, with, boole, s, system, and, attempts, to, solve, the, problems, recognised, earlier, by, keynes, and, others, theodore, hailperin, showed, much, earlier, that, boole, had, used, the, correct, mathematical, definition, of, independence, in, his, worked, out, problems, boole, s, work, and, that, of, later, logicians, initially, appeared, to, have, no, engineering, uses, claude, shannon, attended, a, philosophy, class, at, the, university, of, michigan, which, introduced, him, to, boole, s, studies, shannon, recognised, that, boole, s, work, could, form, the, basis, of, mechanisms, and, processes, in, the, real, world, and, that, it, was, therefore, highly, relevant, in, 1937, shannon, went, on, to, write, a, master, s, thesis, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, in, which, he, showed, how, boolean, algebra, could, optimise, the, design, of, systems, of, electromechanical, relays, then, used, in, telephone, routing, switches, he, also, proved, that, circuits, with, relays, could, solve, boolean, algebra, problems, employing, the, properties, of, electrical, switches, to, process, logic, is, the, basic, concept, that, underlies, all, modern, electronic, digital, computers, victor, shestakov, at, moscow, state, university, 1907, 1987, proposed, a, theory, of, electric, switches, based, on, boolean, logic, even, earlier, than, claude, shannon, in, 1935, on, the, testimony, of, soviet, logicians, and, mathematicians, sofya, yanovskaya, gaaze, rapoport, roland, dobrushin, lupanov, medvedev, and, uspensky, but, the, first, publication, of, shestakov, s, result, took, place, only, in, 1941, in, russian, hence, boolean, algebra, became, the, foundation, of, practical, digital, circuit, design, and, boole, via, shannon, and, shestakov, provided, the, theoretical, grounding, for, the, information, age, boole, s, legacy, surrounds, us, everywhere, in, the, computers, information, storage, and, retrieval, electronic, circuits, and, controls, that, support, life, learning, and, communications, in, the, 21st, century, his, pivotal, advances, in, mathematics, logic, and, probability, provided, the, essential, groundwork, for, modern, mathematics, microelectronic, engineering, and, computer, science, university, college, cork, the, year, 2015, saw, the, 200th, anniversary, of, boole, s, birth, to, mark, the, bicentenary, year, university, college, cork, joined, admirers, of, boole, around, the, world, to, celebrate, his, life, and, legacy, ucc, s, george, boole, 200, project, featured, events, student, outreach, activities, and, academic, conferences, on, boole, s, legacy, in, the, digital, age, including, a, new, edition, of, desmond, machale, s, 1985, biography, the, life, and, work, of, george, boole, a, prelude, to, the, digital, age, 2014, the, search, engine, google, marked, the, 200th, anniversary, of, his, birth, on, 2, november, 2015, with, an, algebraic, reimaging, of, its, google, doodle, in, september, 2022, a, statue, of, george, boole, in, his, role, as, a, teacher, was, unveiled, at, lincoln, central, train, station, in, boole, s, home, town, of, lincoln, boole, s, views, were, given, in, four, published, addresses, the, genius, of, sir, isaac, newton, the, right, use, of, leisure, the, claims, of, science, and, the, social, aspect, of, intellectual, culture, the, first, of, these, was, from, 1835, when, charles, anderson, pelham, 1st, earl, of, yarborough, gave, a, bust, of, newton, to, the, mechanics, institute, in, lincoln, the, second, justified, and, celebrated, in, 1847, the, outcome, of, the, successful, campaign, for, early, closing, in, lincoln, headed, by, alexander, leslie, melville, of, branston, hall, the, claims, of, science, was, given, in, 1851, at, queen, s, college, cork, the, social, aspect, of, intellectual, culture, was, also, given, in, cork, in, 1855, to, the, cuvierian, society, though, his, biographer, des, machale, describes, boole, as, an, agnostic, deist, boole, read, a, wide, variety, of, christian, theology, combining, his, interests, in, mathematics, and, theology, he, compared, the, christian, trinity, of, father, son, and, holy, ghost, with, the, three, dimensions, of, space, and, was, attracted, to, the, hebrew, conception, of, god, as, an, absolute, unity, boole, considered, converting, to, judaism, but, in, the, end, was, said, to, have, chosen, unitarianism, boole, came, to, speak, against, what, he, saw, as, prideful, scepticism, and, instead, favoured, the, belief, in, a, supreme, intelligent, cause, he, also, declared, i, firmly, believe, for, the, accomplishment, of, a, purpose, of, the, divine, mind, in, addition, he, stated, to, infer, the, existence, of, an, intelligent, cause, from, the, teeming, evidence, of, surrounding, design, to, rise, to, the, conception, of, a, moral, governor, of, the, world, from, the, study, of, the, constitution, and, the, moral, provisions, of, our, own, nature, these, though, but, the, feeble, steps, of, an, understanding, limited, in, its, faculties, and, its, materials, of, knowledge, are, of, more, avail, than, the, ambitious, attempt, to, arrive, at, a, certainty, unattainable, on, the, ground, of, natural, religion, and, as, these, were, the, most, ancient, so, are, they, still, the, most, solid, foundations, revelation, being, set, apart, of, the, belief, that, the, course, of, this, world, is, not, abandoned, to, chance, and, inexorable, fate, two, influences, on, boole, were, later, claimed, by, his, wife, mary, everest, boole, a, universal, mysticism, tempered, by, jewish, thought, and, indian, logic, mary, boole, stated, that, an, adolescent, mystical, experience, provided, for, his, life, s, work, my, husband, told, me, that, when, he, was, a, lad, of, seventeen, a, thought, struck, him, suddenly, which, became, the, foundation, of, all, his, future, discoveries, it, was, a, flash, of, psychological, insight, into, the, conditions, under, which, a, mind, most, readily, accumulates, knowledge, for, a, few, years, he, supposed, himself, to, be, convinced, of, the, truth, of, the, bible, as, a, whole, and, even, intended, to, take, orders, as, a, clergyman, of, the, english, church, but, by, the, help, of, a, learned, jew, in, lincoln, he, found, out, the, true, nature, of, the, discovery, which, had, dawned, on, him, this, was, that, man, s, mind, works, by, means, of, some, mechanism, which, functions, normally, towards, monism, in, ch, 13, of, laws, of, thought, boole, used, examples, of, propositions, from, baruch, spinoza, and, samuel, clarke, the, work, contains, some, remarks, on, the, relationship, of, logic, to, religion, but, they, are, slight, and, cryptic, boole, was, apparently, disconcerted, at, the, book, s, reception, just, as, a, mathematical, toolset, george, afterwards, learned, to, his, great, joy, that, the, same, conception, of, the, basis, of, logic, was, held, by, leibniz, the, contemporary, of, newton, de, morgan, of, course, understood, the, formula, in, its, true, sense, he, was, boole, s, collaborator, all, along, herbert, spencer, jowett, and, robert, leslie, ellis, understood, i, feel, sure, and, a, few, others, but, nearly, all, the, logicians, and, mathematicians, ignored, the, statement, that, the, book, was, meant, to, throw, light, on, the, nature, of, the, human, mind, and, treated, the, formula, entirely, as, a, wonderful, new, method, of, reducing, to, logical, order, masses, of, evidence, about, external, fact, mary, boole, claimed, that, there, was, profound, influence, via, her, uncle, george, everest, of, indian, thought, in, general, and, indian, logic, in, particular, on, george, boole, as, well, as, on, augustus, de, morgan, and, charles, babbage, think, what, must, have, been, the, effect, of, the, intense, hinduizing, of, three, such, men, as, babbage, de,
