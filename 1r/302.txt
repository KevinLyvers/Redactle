revelation, or, a, series, of, revelations, for, the, poet, as, for, the, reader, for, it, to, be, that, there, must, have, been, the, greatest, freedom, of, the, material, to, move, about, in, it,

from, memory, instead, in, the, summer, of, 1962, frost, accompanied, interior, secretary, stewart, udall, on, a, visit, to, the, soviet, union, in, hopes, of, meeting, nikita, khrushchev, to, lobby,

of, the, major, american, poets, randall, jarrell, s, influential, essays, on, frost, include, robert, frost, s, home, burial, 1962, an, extended, close, reading, of, that, particular, poem, and, to, the, laodiceans, 1952, in, which, jarrell, defended, frost, against, critics, who, had, accused, frost, of, being, too, traditional, and, out, of, touch, with, modern, or, modernist, poetry, jarrell, wrote, the, regular, ways, of, looking, at, frost, s, poetry, are, grotesque, simplifications, distortions, falsifications, coming, to, know, his, poetry, well, ought, to, be, enough, in, itself, to, dispel, any, of, them, and, to, make, plain, the, necessity, of, finding, some, other, way, of, talking, about, his, work, jarrell, s, close, readings, of, poems, like, neither, out, too, far, nor, in, too, deep, led, readers, and, critics, to, perceive, more, of, the, complexities, in, frost, s, poetry, brad, leithauser, notes, that, the, other, frost, that, jarrell, discerned, behind, the, genial, homespun, new, england, rustic, the, dark, frost, who, was, desperate, frightened, and, brave, has, become, the, frost, we, ve, all, learned, to, recognize, and, the, little, known, poems, jarrell, singled, out, as, central, to, the, frost, canon, are, now, to, be, found, in, most, anthologies, jarrell, lists, a, selection, of, the, frost, poems, he, considers, the, most, masterful, including, the, witch, of, co, s, home, burial, a, servant, to, servants, directive, neither, out, too, far, nor, in, too, deep, provide, provide, acquainted, with, the, night, after, apple, picking, mending, wall, the, most, of, it, an, old, man, s, winter, night, to, earthward, stopping, by, woods, on, a, snowy, evening, spring, pools, the, lovely, shall, be, choosers, design, and, desert,

worse, than, be, a, swinger, of, birches, robert, frost, in, 2003, the, critic, charles, mcgrath, noted, that, critical, views, on, frost, s, poetry, have, changed, over, the, years, as, has, his, public, image, in, the, vicissitudes, of, literary, reputation, mcgrath, wrote, robert, frost, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1963, was, generally, considered, to, be, a, new, england, folkie, in, 1977, the, third, volume, of, lawrance, thompson, s, biography, suggested, that, frost, was, a, much, nastier, piece, of, work, than, anyone, had, imagined, a, few, years, later, thanks, to, the, reappraisal, of, critics, like, william, h, pritchard, and, harold, bloom, and, of, younger, poets, like, joseph, brodsky, he, bounced, back, again, this, time, as, a, bleak, and, unforgiving, modernist, in, the, norton, anthology, of, modern, poetry, editors, richard, ellmann, and, robert, o, clair, compared, and, contrasted, frost, s, unique, style, to, the, work, of, the, poet, edwin, arlington, robinson, since, they, both, frequently, used, new, england, settings, for, their, poems, however, they, state, that, frost, s, poetry, was, less, literary, and, that, this, was, possibly, due, to, the, influence, of, english, and, irish, writers, like, thomas, hardy, and, w, b, yeats, they, note, that, frost, s, poems, show, a, successful, striving, for, utter, colloquialism, and, always, try, to, remain, down, to, earth, while, at, the, same, time, using, traditional, forms, despite, the, trend, of, american, poetry, towards, free, verse, which, frost, famously, said, was, like, playing, tennis, without, a, net, the, poetry, foundation, makes, the, same, point, placing, frost, s, work, at, the, crossroads, of, nineteenth, century, american, poetry, and, modernism, they, also, note, that, frost, believed, that, the, self, imposed, restrictions, of, meter, in, form, was, more, helpful, than, harmful, because, he, could, focus, on, the, content, of, his, poems, instead, of, concerning, himself, with, creating, innovative, new, verse, forms, an, earlier, study, by, the, poet, james, radcliffe, squires, spoke, to, the, distinction, of, frost, as, a, poet, whose, verse, soars, more, for, the, difficulty, and, skill, by, which, he, attains, his, final, visions, than, for, the, philosophical, purity, of, the, visions, themselves, he, has, written, at, a, time, when, the, choice, for, the, poet, seemed, to, lie, among, the, forms, of, despair, science, solipsism, or, the, religion, of, the, past, century, frost, has, refused, all, of, these, and, in, the, refusal, has, long, seemed, less, dramatically, committed, than, others, but, no, he, must, be, seen, as, dramatically, uncommitted, to, the, single, solution, insofar, as, frost, allows, to, both, fact, and, intuition, a, bright, kingdom, he, speaks, for, many, of, us, insofar, as, he, speaks, through, an, amalgam, of, senses, and, sure, experience, so, that, his, poetry, seems, a, nostalgic, memory, with, overtones, touching, some, conceivable, future, he, speaks, better, than, most, of, us, that, is, to, say, as, a, poet, must, the, classicist, helen, h, bacon, has, proposed, that, frost, s, deep, knowledge, of, greek, and, roman, classics, influenced, much, of, his, work, frost, s, education, at, lawrence, high, school, dartmouth, and, harvard, was, based, mainly, on, the, classics, as, examples, she, links, imagery, and, action, in, frost, s, early, poems, birches, 1915, and, wild, grapes, 1920, with, euripides, bacchae, she, cites, certain, motifs, including, that, of, the, tree, bent, down, to, earth, as, evidence, of, his, very, attentive, reading, of, bacchae, almost, certainly, in, greek, bacon, compares, the, poetic, techniques, used, by, frost, in, one, more, brevity, 1953, to, those, of, virgil, in, the, aeneid, she, notes, that, this, sampling, of, the, ways, frost, drew, on, the, literature, and, concepts, of, the, greek, and, roman, world, at, every, stage, of, his, life, indicates, how, imbued, with, it, he, was, in, contemporary, literary, criticism, the, editors, state, that, frost, s, best, work, explores, fundamental, questions, of, existence, depicting, with, chilling, starkness, the, loneliness, of, the, individual, in, an, indifferent, universe, the, critic, t, k, whipple, focused, on, this, bleakness, in, frost, s, work, stating, that, in, much, of, his, work, particularly, in, north, of, boston, his, harshest, book, he, emphasizes, the, dark, background, of, life, in, rural, new, england, with, its, degeneration, often, sinking, into, total, madness, in, sharp, contrast, the, founding, publisher, and, editor, of, poetry, harriet, monroe, emphasized, the, folksy, new, england, persona, and, characters, in, frost, s, work, writing, that, perhaps, no, other, poet, in, our, history, has, put, the, best, of, the, yankee, spirit, into, a, book, so, completely, she, notes, his, frequent, use, of, rural, settings, and, farm, life, and, she, likes, that, in, these, poems, frost, is, most, interested, in, showing, the, human, reaction, to, nature, s, processes, she, also, notes, that, while, frost, s, narrative, character, based, poems, are, often, satirical, frost, always, has, a, sympathetic, humor, towards, his, subjects, frost, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, 31, times, harvard, s, 1965, alumni, directory, notes, that, frost, received, an, honorary, degree, there, although, he, never, graduated, from, college, frost, received, over, 40, honorary, degrees, including, from, princeton, oxford, and, cambridge, universities, and, became, the, only, person, to, have, received, two, honorary, degrees, from, dartmouth, college, during, his, lifetime, the, robert, frost, middle, school,

states, congressional, gold, medal, in, recognition, of, his, poetry, which, has, enriched, the, culture, of, the, united, states, and, the, philosophy, of, the, world, it, was, formally, bestowed, on, him, by, john, f, kennedy, in, march, 1962, also, in, 1962, he, was, awarded, the, edward, macdowell, medal, for, outstanding, contribution, to, the, arts, by, the, macdowell, colony, in, june, 1922, the, vermont, state, league, of, women, s, clubs, elected, frost, as, poet, laureate, of, vermont, when, a, new, york, times, editorial, strongly, criticized, the, decision, of, the, women, s, clubs, sarah, cleghorn, and, other, women, wrote, to, the, newspaper, defending, frost, frost, was, elected, to, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1931, and, the, american,
