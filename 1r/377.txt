du, cr, puscule, 1835, les, voix, int, rieures, 1837, and, les, rayons, et, les, ombres, 1840, this, cemented, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, greatest, elegiac, and, lyric, poets, of, his, time, like, many, young, writers, of, his, generation, hugo, was, profoundly, influenced, by, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, the, famous, figure, in, the, literary, movement, of, romanticism, and, france, s, pre, eminent, literary, figure, during, the, early, 19th, century, in, his, youth, hugo, resolved, to, be, chateaubriand, or, nothing, and, his, life, would, come, to, parallel, that, of, his, predecessor, in, many, ways, like, chateaubriand, hugo, furthered, the, cause, of, romanticism, became, involved, in, politics, though, mostly, as, a, champion, of, republicanism, and, was, forced, into, exile, due, to, his, political, stances, along, with, chateaubriand, he, attended, the, coronation, of, charles, x, in, reims, in, 1825, the, precocious, passion, and, eloquence, of, hugo, s, early, work, brought, success, and, fame, at, an, early, age, his, first, collection, of, poetry, odes, et, po, sies, diverses, was, published, in, 1822, when, he, was, only, 20, years, old, and, earned, him, a, royal, pension, from, louis, xviii, though, the, poems, were, admired, for, their, spontaneous, fervor, and, fluency, the, collection, that, followed, four, years, later, in, 1826, odes, et, ballades, revealed, hugo, to, be, a, great, poet, a, natural, master, of, lyric, and, creative, song, victor, hugo, s, first, mature, work, of, fiction, was, published, in, february, 1829, by, charles, gosselin, without, the, author, s, name, and, reflected, the, acute, social, conscience, that, would, infuse, his, later, work, le, dernier, jour, d, un, condamn, the, last, day, of, a, condemned, man, would, have, a, profound, influence, on, later, writers, such, as, albert, camus, charles, dickens, and, fyodor, dostoyevsky, claude, gueux, a, documentary, short, story, about, a, real, life, murderer, who, had, been, executed, in, france, was, published, in, 1834, hugo, himself, later, considered, it, to, be, a, precursor, to, his, great, work, on, social, injustice, les, mis, rables, hugo, became, the, figurehead, of, the, romantic, literary, movement, with, the, plays, cromwell, 1827, and, hernani, 1830, hernani, announced, the, arrival, of, french, romanticism, performed, at, the, com, die, fran, aise, it, was, greeted, with, several, nights, of, rioting, as, romantics, and, traditionalists, clashed, over, the, play, s, deliberate, disregard, for, neo, classical, rules, hugo, s, popularity, as, a, playwright, grew, with, subsequent, plays, such, as, marion, delorme, 1831, le, roi, s, amuse, 1832, and, ruy, blas, 1838, hugo, s, novel, notre, dame, de, paris, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, was, published, in, 1831, and, quickly, translated, into, other, languages, across, europe, one, of, the, effects, of, the, novel, was, to, shame, the, city, of, paris, into, restoring, the, much, neglected, cathedral, of, notre, dame, which, was, attracting, thousands, of, tourists, who, had, read, the, popular, novel, hugo, began, planning, a, major, novel, about, social, misery, and, injustice, as, early, as, the, 1830s, but, a, full, 17, years, were, needed, for, les, mis, rables, to, be, realised, and, finally, published, in, 1862, hugo, had, previously, used, the, departure, of, prisoners, for, the, bagne, of, toulon, in, le, dernier, jour, d, un, condamn, he, went, to, toulon, to, visit, the, bagne, in, 1839, and, took, extensive, notes, though, he, did, not, start, writing, the, book, until, 1845, on, one, of, the, pages, of, his, notes, about, the, prison, he, wrote, in, large, block, letters, a, possible, name, for, his, hero, jean, tr, jean, when, the, book, was, finally, written, tr, jean, became, jean, valjean, hugo, was, acutely, aware, of, the, quality, of, the, novel, as, evidenced, in, a, letter, he, wrote, to, his, publisher, albert, lacroix, on, 23, march, 1862, my, conviction, is, that, this, book, is, going, to, be, one, of, the, peaks, if, not, the, crowning, point, of, my, work, publication, of, les, mis, rables, went, to, the, highest, bidder, the, belgian, publishing, house, lacroix, and, verboeckhoven, undertook, a, marketing, campaign, unusual, for, the, time, issuing, press, releases, about, the, work, a, full, six, months, before, the, launch, it, also, initially, published, only, the, first, part, of, the, novel, fantine, which, was, launched, simultaneously, in, major, cities, installments, of, the, book, sold, out, within, hours, and, had, an, enormous, impact, on, french, society, the, critical, establishment, was, generally, hostile, to, the, novel, taine, found, it, insincere, barbey, d, aurevilly, complained, of, its, vulgarity, gustave, flaubert, found, within, it, neither, truth, nor, greatness, the, goncourt, brothers, lambasted, its, artificiality, and, baudelaire, despite, giving, favourable, reviews, in, newspapers, castigated, it, in, private, as, repulsive, and, inept, however, les, mis, rables, proved, popular, enough, with, the, masses, that, the, issues, it, highlighted, were, soon, on, the, agenda, of, the, national, assembly, of, france, today, the, novel, remains, his, best, known, work, it, is, popular, worldwide, and, has, been, adapted, for, cinema, television, and, stage, shows, an, apocryphal, tale, has, circulated, describing, the, shortest, correspondence, in, history, as, having, been, between, hugo, and, his, publisher, hurst, and, blackett, in, 1862, hugo, was, on, vacation, when, les, mis, rables, was, published, he, queried, the, reaction, to, the, work, by, sending, a, single, character, telegram, to, his, publisher, asking, the, publisher, replied, with, a, single, to, indicate, its, success, hugo, turned, away, from, social, political, issues, in, his, next, novel, les, travailleurs, de, la, mer, toilers, of, the, sea, published, in, 1866, the, book, was, well, received, perhaps, due, to, the, previous, success, of, les, mis, rables, dedicated, to, the, channel, island, of, guernsey, where, hugo, spent, 15, years, of, exile, the, novel, tells, of, a, man, who, attempts, to, win, the, approval, of, his, beloved, s, father, by, rescuing, his, ship, intentionally, marooned, by, its, captain, who, hopes, to, escape, with, a, treasure, of, money, it, is, transporting, through, an, exhausting, battle, of, human, engineering, against, the, force, of, the, sea, and, an, almost, mythical, beast, of, the, sea, a, giant, squid, superficially, an, adventure, one, of, hugo, s, biographers, calls, it, a, metaphor, for, the, 19th, century, technical, progress, creative, genius, and, hard, work, overcoming, the, immanent, evil, of, the, material, world, the, word, used, in, guernsey, to, refer, to, squid, pieuvre, also, sometimes, applied, to, octopus, was, to, enter, the, french, language, as, a, result, of, its, use, in, the, book, hugo, returned, to, political, and, social, issues, in, his, next, novel, l, homme, qui, rit, the, man, who, laughs, which, was, published, in, 1869, and, painted, a, critical, picture, of, the, aristocracy, the, novel, was, not, as, successful, as, his, previous, efforts, and, hugo, himself, began, to, comment, on, the, growing, distance, between, himself, and, literary, contemporaries, such, as, flaubert, and, mile, zola, whose, realist, and, naturalist, novels, were, now, exceeding, the, popularity, of, his, own, work, his, last, novel, quatre, vingt, treize, ninety, three, published, in, 1874, dealt, with, a, subject, that, hugo, had, previously, avoided, the, reign, of, terror, during, the, french, revolution, though, hugo, s, popularity, was, on, the, decline, at, the, time, of, its, publication, many, now, consider, ninety, three, to, be, a, work, on, par, with, hugo, s, better, known, novels, after, three, unsuccessful, attempts, hugo, was, finally, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1841, solidifying, his, position, in, the, world, of, french, arts, and, letters, a, group, of, french, academicians, particularly, tienne, de, jouy, were, fighting, against, the, romantic, evolution, and, had, managed, to, delay, victor, hugo, s, election, thereafter, he, became, increasingly, involved, in, french, politics, on, the, nomination, of, king, louis, philippe, hugo, entered, the, upper, chamber, of, parliament, as, a, pair, de, france, in, 1845, where, he, spoke, against, the, death, penalty, and, social, injustice, and, in, favour, of, freedom, of, the, press, and, self, government, for, poland, in, 1848, hugo, was, elected, to, the, national, assembly, of, the, second, republic, as, a, conservative, in, 1849, he, broke, with, the, conservatives, when, he, gave, a, noted, speech, calling, for, the, end, of, misery, and, poverty, other, speeches, called, for, universal, suffrage, and, free, education, for, all, children, hugo, s, advocacy, to, abolish, the, death, penalty, was, renowned, internationally, when, louis, napoleon, napoleon, iii, seized, complete, power, in, 1851, establishing, an, anti, parliamentary, constitution, hugo, openly, declared, him, a, traitor, to, france, he, moved, to, brussels, then, jersey, from, which, he, was, expelled, for, supporting, l, homme, a, local, newspaper, that, had, published, a, letter, to, queen, victoria, by, a, french, republican, deemed, treasonous, he, finally, settled, with, his, family, at, hauteville, house, in, saint, peter, port, guernsey, where, he, would, live, in, exile, from, october, 1855, until, 1870, while, in, exile, hugo, published, his, famous, political, pamphlets, against, napoleon, iii, napol, on, le, petit, and, histoire, d, un, crime, the, pamphlets, were, banned, in, france, but, nonetheless, had, a, strong, impact, there, he, also, composed, or, published, some, of, his, best, work, during, his, period, in, guernsey, including, les, mis, rables, and, three, widely, praised, collections, of, poetry, les, ch, timents, 1853, les, contemplations, 1856, and, la, l, gende, des, si, cles, 1859, however, v, ctor, hugo, said, in, les, mis, rables, the, wretched, moral, character, of, th, nardier, the, frustrated, bourgeois, was, hopeless, it, was, in, america, what, it, had, been, in, europe, contact, with, a, wicked, man, is, sometimes, enough, to, rot, a, good, deed, and, cause, something, bad, to, come, out, of, it, with, marius, s, money, th, nardier, became, a, slave, trader, like, most, of, his, contemporaries, hugo, justified, colonialism, in, terms, of, a, civilizing, mission, and, putting, an, end, to, the, slave, trade, on, the, barbary, coast, in, a, speech, delivered, on, 18, may, 1879, during, a, banquet, to, celebrate, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, presence, of, the, french, abolitionist, writer, and, parliamentarian, victor, sch, lcher, hugo, declared, that, the, mediterranean, sea, formed, a, natural, divide, between, ultimate, civilisation, and, utter, barbarism, hugo, declared, that, god, offers, africa, to, europe, take, it, and, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, white, man, made, a, man, out, of, the, black, in, the, twentieth, century, europe, will, make, a, world, out, of, africa, this, might, partly, explain, why, in, spite, of, his, deep, interest, and, involvement, in, political, matters, he, remained, silent, on, the, algerian, issue, he, knew, about, the, atrocities, committed, by, the, french, army, during, the, french, conquest, of, algeria, as, evidenced, by, his, diary, but, he, never, denounced, them, publicly, however, in, les, mis, rables, hugo, wrote, algeria, too, harshly, conquered, and, as, in, the, case, of, india, by, the, english, with, more, barbarism, than, civilization, after, coming, in, contact, with, victor, sch, lcher, a, writer, who, fought, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, french, colonialism, in, the, caribbean, he, started, strongly, campaigning, against, slavery, in, a, letter, to, american, abolitionist, maria, weston, chapman, on, 6, july, 1851, hugo, wrote, slavery, in, the, united, states, it, is, the, duty, of, this, republic, to, set, such, a, bad, example, no, longer, the, united, states, must, renounce, slavery, or, they, must, renounce, liberty, in, 1859, he, wrote, a, letter, asking, the, united, states, government, for, the, sake, of, their, own, reputation, in, the, future, to, spare, abolitionist, john, brown, s, life, hugo, justified, brown, s, actions, by, these, words, assuredly, if, insurrection, is, ever, a, sacred, duty, it, must, be, when, it, is, directed, against, slavery, hugo, agreed, to, diffuse, and, sell, one, of, his, best, known, drawings, le, pendu, an, homage, to, john, brown, so, one, could, keep, alive, in, souls, the, memory, of, this, liberator, of, our, black, brothers, of, this, heroic, martyr, john, brown, who, died, for, christ, just, as, christ, only, one, slave, on, earth, is, enough, to, dishonour, the, freedom, of, all, men, so, the, abolition, of, slavery, is, at, this, hour, the, supreme, goal, of, the, thinkers, as, a, novelist, diarist, and, member, of, parliament, victor, hugo, fought, a, lifelong, battle, for, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, the, last, day, of, a, condemned, man, published, in, 1829, analyses, the, pangs, of, a, man, awaiting, execution, several, entries, in, things, seen, choses, vues, the, diary, he, kept, between, 1830, and, 1885, convey, his, firm, condemnation, of, what, he, regarded, as, a, barbaric, sentence, on, 15, september, 1848, seven, months, after, the, revolution, of, 1848, he, delivered, a, speech, before, the, assembly, and, concluded, you, have, overthrown, the, throne, now, overthrow, the, scaffold, his, influence, was, credited, in, the, removal, of, the, death, penalty, from, the, constitutions, of, geneva, portugal, and, colombia, he, had, also, pleaded, for, benito, ju, rez, to, spare, the, recently, captured, emperor, maximilian, i, of, mexico, but, to, no, avail, although, napoleon, iii, granted, an, amnesty, to, all, political, exiles, in, 1859, hugo, declined, as, it, meant, he, would, have, to, curtail, his, criticisms, of, the, government, it, was, only, after, napoleon, iii, fell, from, power, and, the, third, republic, was, proclaimed, that, hugo, finally, returned, to, his, homeland, in, 1870, where, he, was, promptly, elected, to, the, national, assembly, and, the, senate, he, was, in, paris, during, the, siege, by, the, prussian, army, in, 1870, famously, eating, animals, given, to, him, by, the, paris, zoo, as, the, siege, continued, and, food, became, ever, more, scarce, he, wrote, in, his, diary, that, he, was, reduced, to, eating, the, unknown, during, the, paris, commune, the, revolutionary, government, that, took, power, on, 18, march, 1871, and, was, toppled, on, 28, may, victor, hugo, was, harshly, critical, of, the, atrocities, committed, on, both, sides, on, 9, april, he, wrote, in, his, diary, in, short, this, commune, is, as, idiotic, as, the, national, assembly, is, ferocious, from, both, sides, folly, yet, he, made, a, point, of, offering, his, support, to, members, of, the, commune, subjected, to, brutal, repression, he, had, been, in, brussels, since, 22, march, 1871, when, in, the, 27, may, issue, of, the, belgian, newspaper, l, ind, pendance, victor, hugo, denounced, the, government, s, refusal, to, grant, political, asylum, to, the, communards, threatened, with, imprisonment, banishment, or, execution, this, caused, so, much, uproar, that, in, the, evening, a, mob, of, fifty, to, sixty, men, attempted, to, force, their, way, into, the, writer, s, house, shouting, death, to, victor, hugo, hang, him, death, to, the, scoundrel, hugo, who, said, a, war, between, europeans, is, a, civil, war, was, an, enthusiastic, advocate, for, the, creation, of, the, united, states, of, europe, he, expounded, his, views, on, the, subject, in, a, speech, he, delivered, during, the, international, peace, congress, which, took, place, in, paris, in, 1849, because, of, his, concern, for, the, rights, of, artists, and, copyright, he, was, a, founding, member, of, the, association, litt, raire, et, artistique, internationale, which, led, to, the, berne, convention, for, the, protection, of, literary, and, artistic, works, however, in, pauvert, s, published, archives, he, states, strongly, that, any, work, of, art, has, two, authors, the, people, who, confusingly, feel, something, a, creator, who, translates, these, feelings, and, the, people, again, who, consecrate, his, vision, of, that, feeling, when, one, of, the, authors, dies, the, rights, should, totally, be, granted, back, to, the, other, the, people, he, was, one, of, the, earlier, supporters, of, the, concept, of, domaine, public, payant, under, which, a, nominal, fee, would, be, charged, for, copying, or, performing, works, in, the, public, domain, and, this, would, go, into, a, common, fund, dedicated, to, helping, artists, especially, young, people, hugo, s, religious, views, changed, radically, over, the, course, of, his, life, in, his, youth, and, under, the, influence, of, his, mother, he, identified, as, a, catholic, and, professed, respect, for, church, hierarchy, and, authority, from, there, he, became, a, non, practising, catholic, and, increasingly, expressed, anti, catholic, and, anti, clerical, views, he, frequented, spiritism, during, his, exile, where, he, participated, also, in, many, s, ances, conducted, by, madame, delphine, de, girardin, and, in, later, years, settled, into, a, rationalist, deism, similar, to, that, espoused, by, voltaire, a, census, taker, asked, hugo, in, 1872, if, he, was, a, catholic, and, he, replied, no, a, freethinker, after, 1872, hugo, never, lost, his, antipathy, towards, the, catholic, church, he, felt, the, church, was, indifferent, to, the, plight, of, the, working, class, under, the, oppression, of, the, monarchy, perhaps, he, also, was, upset, by, the, frequency, with, which, his, work, appeared, on, the, church, s, list, of, banned, books, hugo, counted, 740, attacks, on, les, mis, rables, in, the, catholic, press, when, hugo, s, sons, charles, and, fran, ois, victor, died, he, insisted, that, they, be, buried, without, a, crucifix, or, priest, in, his, will, he, made, the, same, stipulation, about, his, own, death, and, funeral, yet, he, believed, in, life, after, death, and, prayed, every, single, morning, and, night, convinced, as, he, wrote, in, the, man, who, laughs, that, thanksgiving, has, wings, and, flies, to, its, right, destination, your, prayer, knows, its, way, better, than, you, do, hugo, s, rationalism, can, be, found, in, poems, such, as, torquemada, 1869, about, religious, fanaticism, the, pope, 1878, anti, clerical, religions, and, religion, 1880, denying, the, usefulness, of, churches, and, published, posthumously, the, end, of, satan, and, god, 1886, and, 1891, respectively, in, which, he, represents, christianity, as, a, griffin, and, rationalism, as, an, angel, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, also, garnered, attention, due, to, its, portrayal, of, the, abuse, of, power, by, the, church, even, getting, listed, as, one, of, the, forbidden, books, by, it, in, fact, earlier, adaptations, had, to, change, the, villain, claude, frollo, from, being, a, priest, to, avoid, backlash, vincent, van, gogh, ascribed, the, saying, religions, pass, away, but, god, remains, actually, by, jules, michelet, to, hugo, although, hugo, s, many, talents, did, not, include, exceptional, musical, ability, he, nevertheless, had, a, great, impact, on, the, music, world, through, the, inspiration, that, his, works, provided, for, composers, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, hugo, himself, particularly, enjoyed, the, music, of, gluck, mozart, weber, and, meyerbeer, in, les, mis, rables, he, calls, the, huntsman, s, chorus, in, weber, s, euryanthe, perhaps, the, most, beautiful, piece, of, music, ever, composed, he, also, greatly, admired, beethoven, and, rather, unusually, for, his, time, appreciated, works, by, composers, from, earlier, centuries, such, as, palestrina, and, monteverdi, two, famous, musicians, of, the, 19th, century, were, friends, of, hugo, hector, berlioz, and, franz, liszt, the, latter, played, beethoven, in, hugo, s, home, and, hugo, joked, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, that, thanks, to, liszt, s, piano, lessons, he, learned, how, to, play, a, favourite, song, on, the, piano, with, only, one, finger, hugo, also, worked, with, composer, louise, bertin, writing, the, libretto, for, her, 1836, opera, la, esmeralda, which, was, based, on, the, character, in, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, although, for, various, reasons, the, opera, closed, soon, after, its, fifth, performance, and, is, little, known, today, it, has, enjoyed, a, modern, revival, both, in, a, piano, song, concert, version, by, liszt, at, the, festival, international, victor, hugo, et, gaux, 2007, and, in, a, full, orchestral, version, presented, in, july, 2008, at, le, festival, de, radio, france, et, montpellier, languedoc, roussillon, he, was, also, on, friendly, terms, with, frederic, chopin, he, introduced, him, to, george, sand, who, would, be, his, lover, for, years, in, 1849, hugo, attended, chopin, s, funeral, on, the, other, hand, he, had, low, esteem, for, richard, wagner, whom, he, described, as, a, man, of, talent, coupled, with, imbecility, well, over, one, thousand, musical, compositions, have, been, inspired, by, hugo, s, works, from, the, 19th, century, until, the, present, day, in, particular, hugo, s, plays, in, which, he, rejected, the, rules, of, classical, theatre, in, favour, of, romantic, drama, attracted, the, interest, of, many, composers, who, adapted, them, into, operas, more, than, one, hundred, operas, are, based, on, hugo, s, works, and, among, them, are, donizetti, s, lucrezia, borgia, 1833, verdi, s, rigoletto, 1851, and, ernani, 1844, and, ponchielli, s, la, gioconda, 1876, hugo, s, novels, as, well, as, his, plays, have, been, a, great, source, of, inspiration, for, musicians, stirring, them, to, create, not, only, opera, and, ballet, but, musical, theatre, such, as, notre, dame, de, paris, and, the, ever, popular, les, mis, rables, london, west, end, s, longest, running, musical, additionally, hugo, s, poems, have, attracted, an, exceptional, amount, of, interest, from, musicians, and, numerous, melodies, have, been, based, on, his, poetry, by, composers, such, as, berlioz, bizet, faur, franck, lalo, liszt, massenet, saint, sa, ns, rachmaninoff, and, wagner, today, hugo, s, work, continues, to, stimulate, musicians, to, create, new, compositions, for, example, hugo, s, novel, against, capital, punishment, the, last, day, of, a, condemned, man, was, adapted, into, an, opera, by, david, alagna, with, a, libretto, by, fr, d, rico, alagna, and, premi, red, by, their, brother, tenor, roberto, alagna, in, 2007, in, guernsey, every, two, years, the, victor, hugo, international, music, festival, attracts, a, wide, range, of, musicians, and, the, premiere, of, songs, specially, commissioned, from, such, composers, as, guillaume, connesson, richard, dubugnon, olivier, kaspar, and, thierry, escaich, and, based, on, hugo, s, poetry, remarkably, not, only, has, hugo, s, literary, production, been, the, source, of, inspiration, for, musical, works, but, also, his, political, writings, have, received, attention, from, musicians, and, have, been, adapted, to, music, for, instance, in, 2009, italian, composer, matteo, sommacal, was, commissioned, by, festival, bagliori, d, autore, and, wrote, a, piece, for, speaker, and, chamber, ensemble, entitled, actes, et, paroles, with, a, text, elaborated, by, chiara, piola, caselli, after, victor, hugo, s, last, political, speech, addressed, to, the, assembl, e, l, gislative, sur, la, revision, de, la, constitution,
