and, predecessor, ahmad, samani, r, 907, 914, tabatabai, states, that, this, is, proven, in, a, poem, by, rudaki, where, he, tries, to, comfort, ahmad, samani, after, the, death, of, his, father, ismail, samani, in, 907, rudaki, s, career, at, the, samanid, court, is, regarded, as, the, most, important, part, of, his, life, the, role, of, a, court, poet, was, more, than, just, entertaining,

strengthening, rulership, besides, applauding, the, suzerain, and, his, domain, a, poet, was, also, expected, to, give, advice, and, moral, guidance, which, meant, that, rudaki, was, most, likely, experienced, in, that, field, as, well, rudaki, s, success, was, largely, due, to, the, support, of, his, primary, patron, bal, ami, the, latter, played, an, important, role, in, the, blooming, of, persian, literature, in, the, 10th, century, bal, ami, regarded, rudaki, as, the, best, amongst, persian, and, arab, poets, rudaki, was, a, close, friend, to, his, student, shahid, balkhi, a, leading, poet, and, scholar, of, the, samanid, realm, following, shahid, balkhi, s, death, in, 936, rudaki, wrote, an, elegy, for, him, rudaki, s, career, started, to, decline, following, the, downfall, of, bal, ami, in, 937, he, soon, fell, out, of, favour, with, the, amir, and, was, dismissed, from, the, court, rudaki, thereafter, lived, his, last, years, in, poverty, dying, blind, and, alone, in, his, hometown, in, 940, or, 941, the, french, iranologist, gilbert, lazard, considered, rudaki, s, first, successor, to, have, been, abu, shakur, balkhi, who, composed, many, mathnavis, notably, the, afarin, nama, according, to, asadi, tusi, the, divan, collection, of, short, poems, of, rudaki, consisted, of, more, than, 180, 000, verses, but, most, of, it, has, been, lost, what, little, remains, of, rudaki, s, writings, mostly, single, verses, can, be, found, in, persian, dictionaries, particularly, the, lughat, i, furs, of, asadi, tusi, a, few, complete, poems, have, also, survived, most, notably, a, qasida, eulogy, or, ode, consisting, of, almost, 100, verses, quoted, in, the, anonymous, tarikh, i, sistan, the, qasida, was, dedicated, to, abu, ja, far, ahmad, ibn, muhammad, who, ruled, the, region, of, sistan, as, a, samanid, governor, from, 923, to, 963, in, it, rudaki, calls, abu, ja, far, an, aristocrat, of, sasanian, ancestry, and, pride, of, iran, thus, indicating, a, sense, of, continuity, in, iranian, identity, from, the, sasanian, to, the, samanid, period, for, this, poem, abu, ja, far, rewarded, rudaki, with, 10, 000, dinars, rudaki, s, best, known, work, is, his, versification, of, the, kalila, wa, dimna, a, collection, of, indian, fables, nasr, ii, had, ordered, bal, ami, to, translate, the, book, from, arabic, to, persian, and, then, appointed, interpreters, to, read, it, out, loud, so, that, rudaki, who, was, blind, could, versify, it, only, a, few, of, the, verses, made, by, rudaki, have, survived, some, of, them, have, been, identified, in, the, lughat, i, furs, rudaki, s, surviving, poetry, is, generally, easy, for, literate, native, persian, readers, to, understand, despite, variations, in, terminology, word, forms, and, phrase, and, sentence, patterns, although, rudaki, displayed, pro, isma, ili, sympathies, in, his, writings, his, poetry, is, fully, secular, in, nature, islam, was, firmly, established, by, the, 10th, century, however, persians, still, remembered, their, deep, rooted, zoroastrian, history, rudaki, was, more, prone, to, evoke, ancient, iranian, and, zoroastrian, notions, instead, of, muslim, ones, some, of, rudaki, s, poems, were, written, in, the, pre, islamic, andarz, style, i, e, ethical, teachings, friendly, criticism, and, advice, for, correct, behavior, in, both, private, and, public, an, example, of, rudaki, s, zoroastrian, roots, can, be, seen, in, an, excerpt, where, he, is, talking, about, his, patron, it, s, a, puzzle, describing, his, grace, and, will, he, is, the, avesta, in, wisdom, the, zand, in, essence, rudaki, is, considered, to, have, been, the, first, major, poet, to, write, in, new, persian, albeit, he, was, predated, by, other, poets, who, wrote, in, new, persian, such, as, abu, hafs, sughdi, died, 902, most, of, their, work, has, not, survived, in, iran, rudaki, is, acknowledged, as, the, founder, of, new, persian, poetry, and, in, tajikistan, as, the, father, of, tajik, literature, both, claims, which, according, to, the, iranologist, richard, foltz, are, not, contradictory, rudaki, s, life, is, depicted, in, the, 1957, film, of, a, poet, s, fate, written, by, satim, ulugzade, died, 1997, the, following, year, the, latter, wrote, a, play, focused, on, rudaki, entitled, rudaki, which, was, the, first, tajik, biographical, drama, the, 1100th, anniversary, of, rudaki, s, birth, was, commemorated, by, iran, and, the, tajik, soviet, socialist, republic, in, 1958, who, together, held, a, conference, which, was, joined, by, several, eminent, iranian, and, tajik, academics, it, was, during, this, period, that, rudaki, s, burial, place, in, panjrud, was, discovered, the, soviet, archaeologist, and, anthropologist, mikhail, mikhaylovich, gerasimov, died, 1970, dug, out, and, analyzed, rudaki, s, remains, which, he, used, to, recreate, the, latter, s, face, on, a, sculpture, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, rudaki, started, to, become, a, stronger, representation, of, tajik, identity, and, also, reinforced, their, ties, to, the, rest, of, the, persian, speaking, world, according, to, nile, green, rudaki, heralded, a, new, era, for, persian, letters, the, iranologist, francois, de, blois, states, that, rudaki, was, the, most, celebrated, persian, poet, prior, to, ferdowsi, following, his, death, rudaki, continued, to, remain, a, highly, popular, figure, for, around, two, centuries, until, the, mongol, period, where, he, became, unpopular, amongst, the, highly, skilled, poets, of, that, time, however, he, had, not, been, forgotten, as, demonstrated, by, the, attribution, of, his, name, to, the, pseudo, diwan, i, rudaki, called, one, of, the, notorious, literary, frauds, by, de, blois, scholars, such, as, the, 17th, century, hasan, ibn, luft, allah, al, razi, and, 19th, century, reza, qoli, khan, hedayat, both, easily, recognized, that, the, pseudo, diwan, i, rudaki, was, mostly, composed, of, poems, by, qatran, tabrizi, died, after, 1088, while, the, rest, were, already, known, poems, of, rudaki, that, had, been, mentioned, in, tadhkiras, biographical, dictionaries, during, the, 19th, century, rudaki, experienced, a, resurgence, in, popularity, along, with, other, ancient, khurasani, poets
