reorganization, of, supervisor, elections, from, a, citywide, ballot, to, district, ballots, which, was, intended, to, reduce, the, influence, of, money, and, give, neighborhoods, more, control, over, their, representatives, in, city, government, he, also, ran, on, a, culturally, liberal, platform, opposing, government, interference, in, private, sexual, matters, and, favoring, the, legalization,

milk, himself, was, hyperactive, and, prone, to, fantastic, outbursts, of, temper, only, to, recover, quickly, and, shout, excitedly, about, something, else, many, of, his, rants, were, directed, at, his, lover, scott, smith, who, was, becoming, disillusioned, with, the, man, who, was, no, longer, the, laid, back, hippie, he, had, fallen, in, love, with, if, the, candidate, was, manic, he, was, also, dedicated, and, filled, with, good, humor, and, he, had, a, particular, genius, for, getting, media, attention, he, spent, long, hours, registering, voters, and, shaking, hands, at, bus, stops, and, movie, theater, lines, he, took, whatever, opportunity, came, along, to, promote, himself, he, thoroughly, enjoyed, campaigning, and, his, success, was, evident, with, the, large, numbers, of, volunteers, he, had, dozens, at, a, time, stand, along, the, busy, thoroughfare, of, market, street, as, human, billboards, holding, milk, for, assembly, signs, while, commuters, drove, into, the, heart, of, the, city, to, work, he, distributed, his, campaign, literature, anywhere, he, could, including, one, of, the, most, influential, political, groups, in, the, city, the, peoples, temple,

highest, character, when, asked, milk, s, relationship, with, the, temple, was, similar, to, other, politicians, in, northern, california, according, to, the, san, francisco, examiner, jones, and, his, parishioners, were, a, potent, political, force, helping, to, elect, moscone, who, appointed, him, to, the, housing, authority, district, attorney, joseph, freitas, and, sheriff, richard, hongisto, when, milk, learned, jones, was, backing, both, him, and, art, agnos, in, 1976, he, told, friend, michael, wong, well, fuck, him, i, ll, take, his, workers, but, that, s, the, game, jim, jones, plays, but, to, his, volunteers, he, said, make, sure, you, re, always, nice, to, the, peoples, temple, if, they, ask, you, to, do, something, do, it, and, then, send, them, a, note, thanking, them, for, asking, you, to, do, it, the, race, was, close, and, milk, lost, by, fewer, than, 4, 000, votes, agnos, taught, milk, a, valuable, lesson, when, he, criticized, milk, s, campaign, speeches, as, a, downer, you, talk, about, how, you, re, gonna, throw, the, bums, out, but, how, are, you, gonna, fix, things, other, than, beat, me, you, shouldn, t, leave, your, audience, on, a, down, in,

signatures, to, put, the, issue, to, a, county, wide, vote, with, funds, raised, in, part, by, the, florida, citrus, commission, for, which, bryant, was, the, spokeswoman, they, ran, television, advertisements, that, contrasted, the, orange, bowl, parade, with, san, francisco, s, gay, freedom, day, parade, stating, that, dade, county, would, be, turned, into, a, hotbed, of, homosexuality, where, men, cavort, with, little, boys, jim, foster, then, the, most, powerful, political, organizer, in, san, francisco, went, to, miami, to, assist, gay, activists, there, as, election, day, neared, and, a, nationwide, boycott, of, orange, juice, was, organized, the, message, of, the, save, our, children, campaign, was, influential, and, the, result, was, an, overwhelming, defeat, for, gay,

and, saw, an, opportunity, for, a, new, effective, political, cause, gay, activists, were, shocked, to, see, how, little, support, they, received, an, impromptu, demonstration, of, over, 3, 000, castro, residents, formed, the, night, of, the, dade, county, ordinance, vote, gay, men, and, lesbians, were, simultaneously, angry, chanting, out, of, the, bars, and, into, the, streets, and, elated, at, their, passionate, and, powerful, response, the, san, francisco, examiner, reported, that, members, of, the, crowd, pulled, others, out, of, bars, along, castro, and, polk, streets, to, deafening, cheers, milk, led, marchers, that, night, on, a, five, mile, 8, km, course, through, the, city, constantly, moving, aware, that, if, they, stopped, for, too, long, there, would, be, a, riot, he, declared, this, is, the, power, of, the, gay, community, anita, s, going, to, create, a, national, gay, force, activists, had, little, time, to, recover, however, as, the, scenario, replayed, itself, when, civil, rights, ordinances, were, overturned, by, voters, in, saint, paul, minnesota, wichita, kansas, and, eugene, oregon, throughout, 1977, and, into, 1978, california, state, senator, john, briggs, saw, an, opportunity, in, the, christian, fundamentalists, campaign, he, was, hoping, to, be, elected, governor, of, california, in, 1978, and, was, impressed, with, the, voter, turnout, he, saw, in, miami, when, briggs, returned, to, sacramento, he, wrote, a, bill, that, would, ban, gays, and, lesbians, from, teaching, in, public, schools, throughout, california, briggs, claimed, in, private, that, he, had, nothing, against, gays, telling, gay, journalist, randy, shilts, it, s, politics, just, politics, random, attacks, on, gays, rose, in, the, castro, when, the, police, response, was, considered, inadequate, groups, of, gays, patrolled, the, neighborhood, themselves, on, alert, for, attackers, on, june, 21, 1977, a, gay, man, named, robert, hillsborough, died, from, 15, stab, wounds, while, his, attackers, gathered, around, him, and, chanted, faggot, both, mayor, moscone, and, hillsborough, s, mother, blamed, anita, bryant, and, john, briggs, one, week, prior, to, the, incident, briggs, had, held, a, press, conference, at, san, francisco, city, hall, where, he, called, the, city, a, sexual, garbage, heap, because, of, homosexuals, weeks, later, 250, 000, people, attended, the, 1977, san, francisco, gay, freedom, day, parade, the, largest, attendance, at, any, gay, pride, event, to, that, point, in, november, 1976, voters, in, san, francisco, decided, to, reorganize, supervisor, elections, to, choose, supervisors, from, neighborhoods, instead, of, voting, for, them, in, citywide, ballots, harvey, milk, quickly, qualified, as, the, leading, candidate, in, district, 5, surrounding, castro, street, the, nongay, community, has, mostly, accepted, it, what, san, francisco, is, today, and, what, it, is, becoming, reflects, both, the, energy, and, organization, of, the, gay, community, and, its, developing, effort, toward, integration, in, the, political, processes, of, the, american, city, best, known, for, innovation, in, life, styles, the, new, york, times, november, 6, 1977, anita, bryant, s, public, campaign, opposing, homosexuality, and, the, multiple, challenges, to, gay, rights, ordinances, across, the, united, states, fueled, gay,

expos, on, the, veritable, invasion, of, gay, people, into, san, francisco, estimating, that, the, city, s, gay, population, was, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, out, of, a, total, 750, 000, the, castro, village, association, had, grown, to, 90, businesses, the, local, bank, formerly, the, smallest, branch, in, the, city, had, become, the, largest, and, was, forced, to, build, a, wing, to, accommodate, its, new, customers, milk, biographer, randy, shilts, noted, that, his, campaign, was, fueled, by, broader, historical, forces, milk, s, most, successful, opponent, was, the, quiet, and, thoughtful, lawyer, rick, stokes, who, was, backed, by, the, alice, b, toklas, memorial, democratic, club, stokes, was, open, about, his, homosexuality, long, before, milk, had, and, had, experienced, more, severe, treatment, once, hospitalized, and, forced, to, endure, electroshock, therapy, to, cure, him, milk, however, was, more, expressive, about, the, role, of, gay, people, and, their, issues, in, san, francisco, politics, stokes, was, quoted, saying, i, m, just, a, businessman, who, happens, to, be, gay, and, expressed, the, view, that, any, normal, person, could, also, be, homosexual, milk, s, contrasting, populist, philosophy, was, relayed, to, the, new, york, times, we, don, t, want, sympathetic, liberals, we, want, gays, to, represent, gays, i, represent, the, gay, street, people, the, 14, year, old, runaway, from, san, antonio, we, have, to, make, up, for, hundreds, of, years, of, persecution, we, have, to, give, hope, to, that, poor, runaway, kid, from, san, antonio, they, go, to, the, bars, because, churches, are, hostile, they, need, hope, they, need, a, piece, of, the, pie, other, causes, were, also, important, to, milk, he, promoted, larger, and, less, expensive, child, care, facilities, free, public, transportation, and, the, development, of, a, board, of, civilians, to, oversee, the, police, he, advanced, important, neighborhood, issues, at, every, opportunity, milk, used, the, same, manic, campaign, tactics, as, in, previous, races, human, billboards, hours, of, handshaking, and, dozens, of, speeches, calling, on, gay, people, to, have, hope, this, time, the, san, francisco, chronicle, endorsed, him, for, supervisor, on, election, day, november, 8, 1977, he, won, by, 30, against, sixteen, other, candidates, and, after, his, victory, became, apparent, he, arrived, on, castro, street, on, the, back, of, his, campaign, manager, s, motorcycle, escorted, by, sheriff, richard, hongisto, to, what, a, newspaper, story, described, as, a, tumultuous, and, moving, welcome, milk, had, recently, taken, a, new, lover, a, young, man, named, jack, lira, who, was, frequently, drunk, in, public, and, just, as, often, escorted, out, of, political, events, by, milk, s, aides, since, the, race, for, the, california, state, assembly, milk, was, receiving, increasingly, violent, death, threats, concerned, that, his, raised, profile, marked, him, as, a, target, for, assassination, he, recorded, on, tape, his, thoughts, and, whom, he, wanted, to, succeed, him, if, he, were, killed, adding, if, a, bullet, should, enter, my, brain, let, that, bullet, destroy, every, closet, door, milk, s, swearing, in, made, national, headlines, as, he, became, the, first, non, incumbent, openly, gay, man, in, the, united, states, to, win, an, election, for, public, office, he, likened, himself, to, pioneering, african, american, baseball, player, jackie, robinson, and, walked, to, city, hall, arm, in, arm, with, jack, lira, stating, you, can, stand, around, and, throw, bricks, at, silly, hall, or, you, can, take, it, over, well, here, we, are, the, castro, district, was, not, the, only, neighborhood, to, promote, someone, new, to,

the, city, dan, white, a, former, police, officer, and, firefighter, was, also, a, first, time, supervisor, and, he, spoke, of, how, proud, he, was, that, his, grandmother, was, able, to, see, him, sworn, in, milk, s, energy, affinity, for, pranking, and, unpredictability, at, times, exasperated, board, of, supervisors, president, dianne, feinstein, in, his, first, meeting, with, mayor, moscone, milk, called, himself, the, number, one, queen, and, dictated, to, moscone, that, he, would, have, to, go, through, milk, instead, of, the, alice, b, toklas, memorial, democratic, club, if, he, wanted, the, city, s, gay, votes, a, quarter, of, san, francisco, s, voting, population, milk, also, became, moscone, s, closest, ally, on, the, board, of, supervisors, the, biggest, targets, of, milk, s, ire, were, large, corporations, and, real, estate, developers, he, fumed, when, a, parking, garage, was, slated, to, take, the, place, of, homes, near, the, downtown, area, and, tried, to, pass, a, commuter, tax, so, office, workers, who, lived, outside, the, city, and, drove, into, work, would, have, to, pay, for, city, services, they, used, milk, was, often, willing, to, vote, against, feinstein, and, other, more, tenured, members, of, the, board, in, one, controversy, early, in, his, term, milk, agreed, with, fellow, supervisor, dan, white, whose, district, was, located, two, miles, south, of, the, castro, that, a, mental, health, facility, for, troubled, adolescents, should, not, be, placed, there, after, milk, learned, more, about, the, facility, he, decided, to, switch, his, vote, ensuring, white, s, loss, on, the, issue, a, particularly, poignant, cause, that, white, championed, while, campaigning, white, did, not, forget, it, he, opposed, every, initiative, and, issue, milk, supported, milk, began, his, tenure, by, sponsoring, a, civil, rights, bill, that, outlawed, discrimination, based, on, sexual, orientation, the, ordinance, was, called, the, most, stringent, and, encompassing, in, the, nation, and, its, passing, demonstrated, the, growing, political, power, of, homosexuals, according, to, the, new, york, times, only, supervisor, white, voted, against, it, mayor, moscone, enthusiastically, signed, it, into, law, with, a, light, blue, pen, that, milk, had, given, him, for, the, occasion, another, bill, milk, concentrated, on, was, designed, to, solve, the, number, one, problem, according, to, a, recent, citywide, poll, dog, excrement, within, a, month, of, being, sworn, in, he, began, to, work, on, a, city, ordinance, to, require, dog, owners, to, scoop, their, pets, feces, dubbed, the, pooper, scooper, law, its, authorization, by, the, board, of, supervisors, was, covered, extensively, by, television, and, newspapers, in, san, francisco, anne, kronenberg, milk, s, campaign, manager, called, him, a, master, at, figuring, out, what, would, get, him, covered, in, the, newspaper, he, invited, the, press, to, duboce, park, to, explain, why, it, was, necessary, and, while, cameras, were, rolling, stepped, in, the, offending, substance, seemingly, by, mistake, his, staffers, knew, he, had, been, at, the, park, for, an, hour, before, the, press, conference, looking, for, the, right, place, to, walk, in, front, of, the, cameras, it, earned, him, the, most, fan, mail, of, his, tenure, in, politics, and, went, out, on, national, news, releases, milk, had, grown, tired, of, lira, s, drinking, and, considered, breaking, up, with, him, when, lira, called, a, few, weeks, later, and, demanded, milk, come, home, when, milk, arrived, he, found, lira, had, hanged, himself, already, prone, to, severe, depression, lira, had, attempted, suicide, previously, one, of, the, notes, he, left, for, milk, indicated, he, was, upset, about, the, anita, bryant, and, john, briggs, campaigns, john, briggs, was, forced, to, drop, out, of, the, 1978, race, for, california, governor, but, received, enthusiastic, support, for,

messages, supporting, proposition, 6, were, pervasive, throughout, california, and, harvey, milk, attended, every, event, briggs, hosted, milk, campaigned, against, the, bill, throughout, the, state, as, well, and, swore, that, if, briggs, won, california, he, would, still, not, win, san, francisco, in, their, numerous, debates, which, toward, the, end, had, been, honed, to, quick, back, and, forth, banter, briggs, maintained, that, homosexual, teachers, wanted, to, abuse, and, recruit, children, milk, responded, with, statistics, compiled, by, law, enforcement, that, provided, evidence, that, pedophiles, identified, primarily, as, heterosexual, and, dismissed, briggs, assertions, with, one, liner, jokes, if, it, were, true, that, children, mimicked, their, teachers, you, d, sure, have, a, helluva, lot, more, nuns, running, around, attendance, at, gay, pride, marches, during, the, summer, of, 1978, in, los, angeles, and, san, francisco, swelled, an, estimated, 250, 000, to, 375, 000, attended, san, francisco, s, gay, freedom, day, parade, newspapers, claimed, the, higher, numbers, were, due, to, john, briggs, organizers, asked, participants, to, carry, signs, indicating,

gave, a, version, of, what, became, his, most, famous, speech, the, hope, speech, that, the, san, francisco, examiner, said, ignited, the, crowd, on, this, anniversary, of, stonewall, i, ask, my, gay, sisters, and, brothers, to, make, the, commitment, to, fight, for, themselves, for, their, freedom, for, their, country, we, will, not, win, our, rights, by, staying, quietly, in, our, closets, we, are, coming, out, to, fight, the, lies, the, myths, the, distortions, we, are, coming, out, to, tell, the, truths, about, gays, for, i, am, tired, of, the, conspiracy, of, silence, so, i, m, going, to, talk, about, it, and, i, want, you, to, talk, about, it, you, must, come, out, come, out, to, your, parents, your, relatives, despite, the, losses, in, battles, for, gay, rights, across, the, country, that, year, he, remained, optimistic, saying, even, if, gays, lose, in, these, initiatives, people, are, still, being, educated, because, of, anita, bryant, and, dade, county, the, entire, country, was, educated, about, homosexuality, to, a, greater, extent, than, ever, before, the, first, step, is, always, hostility, and, after, that, you, can, sit, down, and, talk, about, it, citing, the, potential, infringements, on, individual, rights, former, governor, of, california, ronald, reagan, voiced, his, opposition, to, the, proposition, as, did, governor, jerry, brown, and, president, jimmy, carter, the, latter, in, an, afterthought, following, a, speech, he, gave, in, sacramento, on, november, 7, 1978, the, proposition, lost, by, more, than, a, million, votes, astounding, gay, activists, on, election, night, in, san, francisco, 75, percent, voted, against, it, on, november, 10, 1978, 10, months, after, he, was, sworn, in, dan, white, resigned, his, position, on, the, san, francisco, board, of, supervisors, saying, that, his, annual, salary, of, 9, 600, equivalent, to, 44, 846, in, 2023, was, not, enough, to, support, his, family, within, days, white, requested, that, his, resignation, be, withdrawn, and, he, be, reinstated, and, mayor, moscone, initially, agreed, however, further, consideration, and, intervention, by, other, supervisors, convinced, moscone, to, appoint, someone, more, in, line, with, the, growing, ethnic, diversity, of, white, s, district, and, the, liberal, leanings, of, the, board, of, supervisors, on, november, 18, and, 19, news, broke,

reinstatement, you, see, that, one, day, i, m, on, the, front, page, and, the, next, i, m, swept, right, off, moscone, planned, to, announce, white, s, replacement, on, november, 27, 1978, a, half, hour, before, the, press, conference, white, avoided, metal, detectors, by, entering, city, hall, through, a, basement, window, and, went, to, moscone, s, office, where, witnesses, heard, shouting, followed, by, gunshots, white, shot, moscone, in, the, shoulder, and, chest, then, twice, in, the, head, white, then, quickly, walked, to, his, former, office, reloading, his, police, issue, revolver, with, hollow, point, bullets, along, the, way, and, intercepted, milk, asking, him, to, step, inside, for, a, moment, dianne, feinstein, heard, gunshots, and, called, police, then, found, milk, face, down, on, the, floor, shot, five, times, including, twice, in, the, head, soon, after, she, announced, to, the, press, today, san, francisco, has, experienced, a, double, tragedy, of, immense, proportions, as, president, of, the, board, of, supervisors, it, is, my, duty, to, inform, you, that, both, mayor, moscone, and, supervisor, harvey, milk, have, been, shot, and, killed, and, the,

when, he, turned, himself, in, many, people, left, flowers, on, the, steps, of, city, hall, and, that, evening, 25, 000, to, 40, 000, formed, a, spontaneous, candlelight, march, from, castro, street, to, city, hall, the, next, day, the, bodies, of, moscone, and, milk, were, brought, to, the, city, hall, rotunda, where, mourners, paid, their, respects, six, thousand, mourners, attended, a, service,

about, the, murders, of, moscone, and, milk, were, fueled, by, the, coincidence, of, dan, white, s, name, and, jones, s, suicide, preparations, a, stunned, district, attorney, called, the,

intense, he, was, impulsive, he, was, an, extremely, competitive, man, obsessively, so, i, think, he, could, not, take, defeat, san, francisco, s, assistant, fire, chief, told, reporters, white, s, first, campaign, manager, quit, in, the, middle, of, the, campaign, and, told, a, reporter, that, white, was, an, egotist, and, it, was, clear, that, he, was, antigay, though, he, denied, it, in, the, press, white, s, associates, and, supporters, described, him, as, a, man, with, a, pugilistic, temper, and, an, impressive, capacity, for, nurturing, a, grudge, the, aide, who, had, handled, communications, between, white, and, milk, remembered, talking, to, him, i, realized, that, he, saw, harvey, milk, and, george, moscone, as, representing, all, that, was, wrong, with, the, world, when, milk, s, friends, looked, in, his, closet, for, a, suit, for, his, casket, they, learned, how, much, he, had, been, affected, by, the, recent, decrease, in, his, income, as, a, supervisor, all, of, his, clothes, were, coming, apart, and, all, of, his, socks, had, holes, his, remains, were, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, split, his, closest, friends, scattered, most, of, the, ashes, in, san, francisco, bay, other, ashes, were, encapsulated, and, buried, beneath, the, sidewalk, in, front, of, 575, castro, street, where, castro, camera, had, been, located, there, is, a, memorial, to, milk, at, the, neptune, society, columbarium, ground, floor, san, francisco, california, harry, britt, one, of, four, people, milk, listed, on, his, tape, as, an, acceptable, replacement, should, he, be, assassinated, was, chosen, to, fill, that, position, by, the, city, s, acting, mayor, dianne, feinstein, dan, white, s, arrest, and, trial, caused, a, sensation, and, illustrated, severe, tensions, between, the, liberal, population, and, the, city, police, the, san, francisco, police, were, mostly, working, class, irish, descendants, who, intensely, disliked, the, growing, gay, immigration, as, well, as, the, liberal, direction, of, the, city, government, after, white, turned, himself, in, and, confessed, he, sat, in, his, cell, while, his, former, colleagues, on, the, police, force, told, harvey, milk, jokes, police, openly, wore, free, dan, white, t, shirts, in, the, days, after, the, murder, an, undersheriff, for, san, francisco, later, stated, the, more, i, observed, what, went, on, at, the, jail, the, more, i, began, to, stop, seeing, what, dan, white, did, as, the, act, of, an, individual, and, began, to, see, it, as, a, political, act, in, a, political, movement, white, showed, no, remorse, for, his, actions, and, exhibited, vulnerability, only, during, an, eight, minute, call, to, his, mother, from, jail, the, jury, for, white, s, trial, consisted, of, white, middle, class, san, franciscans, who, were, mostly, catholic, gays, and, ethnic, minorities, were, excused, from, the, jury, pool, some, of, the, members, of, the, jury, cried, when, they, heard, white, s, tearful, recorded, confession, at, the, end, of, which, the, interrogator, thanked, white, for, his, honesty, white, s, defense, attorney, doug, schmidt, argued, that, his, client, was, not, responsible, for, his, actions, schmidt, used, the, legal, defense, known, as, diminished, capacity, good, people, fine, people, with, fine, backgrounds, simply, don, t, kill, people, in, cold, blood, schmidt, tried, to, prove, that, white, s, anguished, mental, state, was, a, result, of, manipulation, by, the, politicos, in, city, hall, who, had, consistently, disappointed, and, confounded, him, finally, promising, to, give, his, job, back, only, to, refuse, him, again, schmidt, said, that, white, s, mental, deterioration, was, demonstrated, and, exacerbated, by, his, junk, food, binge, the, night, before, the, murders, since, he, was, usually, known, to, have, been, health, food, conscious, area, newspapers, quickly, dubbed, it, the, twinkie, defense, white, was, acquitted, of, the, first, degree, murder, charge, on, may, 21, 1979, but, found, guilty, of, voluntary, manslaughter, of, both, victims, and, he, was, sentenced, to, serve, seven, and, two, thirds, years, with, the, sentence, reduced, for, time, served, and, good, behavior, he, would, be, released, in, five, he, cried, when, he, heard, the, verdict, acting, mayor, feinstein, supervisor, carol, ruth, silver, and, milk, s, successor, harry, britt, condemned, the, jury, s, decision, when, the, verdict, was, announced, over, the, police, radio, someone, sang, danny, boy, on, the, police, band, a, surge, of, people, from, the, castro, district, walked, again, to, city, hall, chanting, avenge, harvey, milk, and, he, got, away, with, murder, pandemonium, rapidly, escalated, as, rocks, were, hurled, at, the, front, doors, of, the, building, milk, s, friends, and, aides, tried, to, stop, the, destruction, but, the, mob, of, more, than, 3, 000, ignored, them, and, lit, police, cars, on, fire, they, shoved, a, burning, newspaper, dispenser, through, the, broken, doors, of, city, hall, then, cheered, as, the, flames, grew, one, of, the, rioters, responded, to, a, reporter, s, question, about, why, they, were, destroying, parts, of, the, city, just, tell, people, that, we, ate, too, many, twinkies, that, s, why, this, is, happening, the, chief, of, police, ordered, the, police, not, to, retaliate, but, to, hold, their, ground, the, white, night, riots, as, they, became, known, lasted, several, hours, later, that, evening, several, police, cruisers, filled, with, officers, wearing, riot, gear, arrived, at, the, elephant, walk, bar, on, castro, street, harvey, milk, s, prot, g, cleve, jones, and, a, reporter, for, the, san, francisco, chronicle, warren, hinckle, watched, as, officers, stormed, into, the, bar, and, began, to, beat, patrons, at, random, after, a, 15, minute, melee, they, left, the, bar, and, struck, out, at, people, walking, along, the, street, after, the, verdict, district, attorney, joseph, freitas, faced, a, furious, gay, community, to, explain, what, had, gone, wrong, the, prosecutor, admitted, to, feeling, sorry, for, white, before, the, trial, and, neglected, to, ask, the, interrogator, who, had, recorded, white, s, confession, and, who, was, a, childhood, friend, of, white, s, and, his, police, softball, team, coach, about, his, biases, and, the, support, white, received, from, the, police, because, he, said, he, did, not, want, to, embarrass, the, detective, in, front, of, his, family, in, court, nor, did, freitas, question, white, s, frame, of, mind, or, lack, of, a, history, of, mental, illness, or, bring, into, evidence, city, politics, suggesting, that, revenge, may, have, been, a, motive, supervisor, carol, ruth, silver, testified, on, the, last, day, of, the, trial, that, white, and, milk, were, not, friendly, yet, she, had, contacted, the, prosecutor, and, insisted, on, testifying, it, was, the, only, testimony, the, jury, heard, about, their, strained, relationship, freitas, blamed, the, jury, who, he, claimed, had, been, taken, in, by, the, whole, emotional, aspect, of, trial, the, murders, of, milk, and, moscone, and, white, s, trial, changed, city, politics, and, the, california, legal, system, in, 1980, san, francisco, ended, district, supervisor, elections, fearing, that, a, board, of, supervisors, so, divisive, would, be, harmful, to, the, city, and, that, they, had, been, a, factor, in, the, assassinations, a, grassroots, neighborhood, effort, to, restore, district, elections, in, the, mid, 1990s, proved, successful, and, the, city, returned, to, neighborhood, representatives, in, 2000, as, a, result, of, dan, white, s, trial, california, voters, changed, the, law, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, acquittals, of, accused, who, knew, what, they, were, doing, but, claimed, their, capacity, was, impaired, diminished, capacity, was, abolished, as, a, defense, to, a, charge, but, courts, allowed, evidence, of, it, when, deciding, whether, to, incarcerate, commit, or, otherwise, punish, a, convicted, defendant, the, twinkie, defense, has, entered, american, mythology, popularly, described, as, a, case, where, a, murderer, escapes, justice, because, he, binged, on, junk, food, simplifying, white, s, lack, of, political, savvy, his, relationships, with, george, moscone, and, harvey, milk, and, what, san, francisco, chronicle, columnist, herb, caen, described, as, his, dislike, of, homosexuals, dan, white, served, just, over, five, years, for, the, double, homicide, of, moscone, and, milk, he, was, released, from, prison, on, january, 7, 1984, on, october, 21, 1985, white, was, found, dead, in, a, running, car, in, his, wife, s, garage, having, committed, suicide, by, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, he, was, 39, years, old, his, defense, attorney, told, reporters, that, he, had, been, despondent, over, the, loss, of, his, family, and, the, situation, he, had, caused, adding, this, was, a, sick, man, milk, s, political, career, centered, on, making, government, responsive, to, individuals, gay, liberation, and, the, importance, of, neighborhoods, to, the, city, at, the, onset, of, each, campaign, an, issue, was, added, to, milk, s, public, political, philosophy, his, 1973, campaign, focused, on, the, first, point, that, as, a, small, business, owner, in, san, francisco, a, city, dominated, by, large, corporations, that, had, been, courted, by, municipal, government, his, interests, were, being, overlooked, because, he, was, not, represented, by, a, large, financial, institution, although, he, did, not, hide, the, fact, that, he, was, gay, it, did, not, become, an, issue, until, his, race, for, the, california, state, assembly, in, 1976, it, was, brought, to, the, fore, in, the, supervisor, race, against, rick, stokes, as, it, was, an, extension, of, his, ideas, of, individual, freedom, milk, strongly, believed, that, neighborhoods, promoted, unity, and, a, small, town, experience, and, that, the, castro, should, provide, services, to, all, its, residents, he, opposed, the, closing, of, an, elementary, school, while, most, gay, people, in, the, castro, did, not, have, children, milk, saw, his, neighborhood, having, the, potential, to, welcome, everyone, he, told, his, aides, to, concentrate, on, fixing, potholes, and, boasted, that, 50, new, stop, signs, had, been, installed, in, district, 5, responding, to, city, residents, largest, complaint, about, living, in, san, francisco, dog, feces, milk, made, it, a, priority, to, enact, the, ordinance, requiring, dog, owners, to, take, care, of, their, pets, droppings, randy, shilts, noted, some, would, claim, harvey, was, a, socialist, or, various, other, sorts, of, ideologues, but, in, reality, harvey, s, political, philosophy, was, never, more, complicated, than, the, issue, of, dogshit, government, should, solve, people, s, basic, problems, karen, foss, a, communications, professor, at, the, university, of, new, mexico, attributes, milk, s, impact, on, san, francisco, politics, to, the, fact, that, he, was, unlike, anyone, else, who, had, held, public, office, in, the, city, she, writes, milk, happened, to, be, a, highly, energetic, charismatic, figure, with, a, love, of, theatrics, and, nothing, to, lose, using, laughter, reversal, transcendence, and, his, insider, outsider, status, milk, helped, create, a, climate, in, which, dialogue, on, issues, became, possible, he, also, provided, a, means, to, integrate, the, disparate, voices, of, his, various, constituencies, milk, had, been, a, rousing, speaker, since, he, began, campaigning, in, 1973, and, his, oratory, skills, only, improved, after, he, became, city, supervisor, his, most, famous, talking, points, became, known, as, the, hope, speech, which, became, a, staple, throughout, his, political, career, it, opened, with, a, play, on, the, accusation, that, gay, people, recruit, impressionable, youth, into, their, numbers, my, name, is, harvey, milk, and, i, want, to, recruit, you, a, version, of, the, hope, speech, that, he, gave, near, the, end, of, his, life, was, considered, by, his, friends, and, aides, to, be, the, best, and, the, closing, the, most, effective, and, the, young, gay, people, in, the, altoona, pennsylvanias, and, the, richmond, minnesotas, who, are, coming, out, and, hear, anita, bryant, in, television, and, her, story, the, only, thing, they, have, to, look, forward, to, is, hope, and, you, have, to, give, them, hope, hope, for, a, better, world, hope, for, a, better, tomorrow, hope, for, a, better, place, to, come, to, if, the, pressures, at, home, are, too, great, hope, that, all, will, be, all, right, without, hope, not, only, gays, but, the, blacks, the, seniors, the, handicapped, the, us, es, the, us, es, will, give, up, and, if, you, help, elect, to, the, central, committee, and, other, offices, more, gay, people, that, gives, a, green, light, to, all, who, feel, disenfranchised, a, green, light, to, move, forward, it, means, hope, to, a, nation, that, has, given, up, because, if, a, gay, person, makes, it, the, doors, are, open, to, everyone, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, milk, emphasized, that, gay, people, should, be, more, visible, to, help, to, end, the, discrimination, and, violence, against, them, although, milk, had, not, come, out, to, his, mother, before, her, death, many, years, before, in, his, final, statement, during, his, taped, prediction, of, his, assassination, he, urged, others, to, do, so, i, cannot, prevent, anyone, from, getting, angry, or, mad, or, frustrated, i, can, only, hope, that, they, ll, turn, that, anger, and, frustration, and, madness, into, something, positive, so, that, two, three, four, five, hundred, will, step, forward, so, the, gay, doctors, will, come, out, the, gay, lawyers, the, gay, judges, gay, bankers, gay, architects, i, hope, that, every, professional, gay, will, say, enough, come, forward, and, tell, everybody, wear, a, sign, let, the, world, know, maybe, that, will, help, however, milk, s, assassination, has, become, entwined, with, his, political, efficacy, partly, because, he, was, killed, at, the, zenith, of, his, popularity, historian, neil, miller, writes, no, contemporary, american, gay, leader, has, yet, to, achieve, in, life, the, stature, milk, found, in, death, his, legacy, has, become, ambiguous, randy, shilts, concludes, his, biography, writing, that, milk, s, success, murder, and, the, inevitable, injustice, of, white, s, verdict, represented, the, experience, of, all, gays, milk, s, life, was, a, metaphor, for, the, homosexual, experience, in, america, according, to, frances, fitzgerald, milk, s, legend, has, been, unable, to, be, sustained, as, no, one, appeared, able, to, take, his, place, in, the, years, after, his, death, the, castro, saw, him, as, a, martyr, but, understood, his, martyrdom, as, an, end, rather, than, a, beginning, he, had, died, and, with, him, a, great, deal, of, the, castro, s, optimism, idealism, and, ambition, seemed, to, die, as, well, the, castro, could, find, no, one, to, take, his, place, in, its, affections, and, possibly, wanted, no, one, on, the, 20th, anniversary, of, milk, s, death, historian, john, d, emilio, said, the, legacy, that, i, think, he, would, want, to, be, remembered, for, is, the, imperative, to, live, one, s, life, at, all, times, with, integrity, for, a, political, career, so, short, cleve, jones, attributes, more, to, his, assassination, than, his, life, his, murder, and, the, response, to, it, made, permanent, and, unquestionable, the, full, participation, of, gay, and, lesbian, people, in, the, political, process, the, city, of, san, francisco, has, paid, tribute, to, milk, by, naming, several, locations, after, him, where, market, and,
