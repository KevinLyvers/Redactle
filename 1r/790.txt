including, the, support, of, the, sanhedrin, in, jerusalem, meanwhile, josephus, fortified, several, towns, and, villages, in, lower, galilee, among, which, were, tiberias, bersabe, selamin, japha,

under, his, command, managed, to, bring, both, sepphoris, and, tiberias, into, subjection, but, was, eventually, forced, to, relinquish, his, hold, on, sepphoris, by, the, arrival, of, roman, forces, under, placidus, the, tribune, and, later, by, vespasian, himself, josephus, first, engaged, the, roman, army, at, a, village, called, garis, where, he, launched, an, attack, against, sepphoris, a, second, time, before, being, repulsed, at, length, he, resisted, the, roman, army, in, its, siege, of, yodfat, jotapata, until, it, fell, to, the, roman, army, in, the, lunar, month, of, tammuz, in,

and, josephus, happened, to, be, one, of, two, men, that, were, left, who, surrendered, to, the, roman, forces, and, became, prisoners, in, 69, ad, josephus, was, released, according, to, his, account, he, acted, as, a, negotiator, with, the, defenders, during, the, siege, of, jerusalem, in, 70, ad, during, which, time, his, parents, were, held, as, hostages, by, simon, bar, giora, while, being, confined, at, yodfat, jotapata, josephus, claimed, to, have, experienced, a, divine, revelation, that, later, led, to, his, speech, predicting, vespasian, would, become, emperor, after, the, prediction, came, true, he, was, released, by, vespasian, who, considered, his, gift, of, prophecy, to, be, divine, josephus, wrote, that, his, revelation, had, taught, him, three, things, that, god, the, creator, of, the, jewish, people, had, decided, to, punish, them, that, fortune, had, been, given, to, the, romans, and, that, god, had, chosen, him, to, announce, the, things, that, are, to, come, to, many, jews, such, claims, were, simply, self, serving, in, 71, ad, he, went, to, rome, as, part, of, the, entourage, of, titus, there, he, became, a, roman, citizen, and, client, of, the, ruling, flavian, dynasty, in, addition, to, roman, citizenship, he, was, granted, accommodation, in, the, conquered, judaea, and, a, pension, while, in, rome, and, under, flavian, patronage, josephus, wrote, all, of, his, known, works, although, he, only, ever, calls, himself, josephus, in, his, writings, later, historians, refer, to, him, as, flavius, josephus, confirming, that, he, adopted, the, nomen, flavius, from, his, patrons, as, was, the, custom, amongst, freedmen, vespasian, arranged, for, josephus, to, marry, a, captured, jewish, woman, whom, he, later, divorced, around, the, year, 71, josephus, married, an, alexandrian, jewish, woman, as, his, third, wife, they, had, three, sons, of, whom, only, flavius, hyrcanus, survived, childhood, josephus, later, divorced, his, third, wife, around, 75, he, married, his, fourth, wife, a, greek, jewish, woman, from, crete, who, was, a, member, of, a, distinguished, family, they, had, two, sons, flavius, justus, and, flavius, simonides, agrippa, josephus, s, life, story, remains, ambiguous, he, was, described, by, harris, in, 1985, as, a, law, observant, jew, who, believed, in, the, compatibility, of, judaism, and, graeco, roman, thought, commonly, referred, to, as, hellenistic, judaism, josippon, the, hebrew, version, of, josephus, contains, changes, his, critics, were, never, satisfied, as, to, why, he, failed, to, commit, suicide, in, galilee, and, after, his, capture, accepted, the, patronage, of, romans, the, works, of, josephus, provide, crucial, information, about, the, first, jewish, roman, war, and, also, represent, important, literary, source, material, for, understanding, the, context, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, late, temple, judaism, josephan, scholarship, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, took, an, interest, in, josephus, s, relationship, to, the, sect, of, the, pharisees, some, portrayed, him, as, a, member, of, the, sect, and, as, a, traitor, to, the, jewish, nation, a, view, which, became, known, as, the, classical, concept, of, josephus, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, new, generation, of, scholars, challenged, this, view, and, formulated, the, modern, concept, of, josephus, they, consider, him, a, pharisee, but, describe, him, in, part, as, patriot, and, a, historian, of, some, standing, in, his, 1991, book, steve, mason, argued, that, josephus, was, not, a, pharisee, but, an, orthodox, aristocrat, priest, who, became, associated, with, the, philosophical, school, of, the, pharisees, as, a, matter, of, deference, and, not, by, willing, association, the, works, of, josephus, include, useful, material, for, historians, about, individuals, groups, customs, and, geographical, places, however, modern, historians, have, been, cautious, of, taking, his, writings, at, face, value, for, example, carl, ritter, in, his, highly, influential, erdkunde, in, the, 1840s, wrote, in, a, review, of, authorities, on, the, ancient, geography, of, the, region, outside, of, the, scriptures, josephus, holds, the, first, and, the, only, place, among, the, native, authors, of, judaea, for, philo, of, alexandria, the, later, talmud, and, other, authorities, are, of, little, service, in, understanding, the, geography, of, the, country, josephus, is, however, to, be, used, with, great, care, as, a, jewish, scholar, as, an, officer, of, galilee, as, a, military, man, and, a, person, of, great, experience, in, everything, belonging, to, his, own, nation, he, attained, to, that, remarkable, familiarity, with, his, country, in, every, part, which, his, antiquarian, researches, so, abundantly, evince, but, he, was, controlled, by, political, motives, his, great, purpose, was, to, bring, his, people, the, despised, jewish, race, into, honour, with, the, greeks, and, romans, and, this, purpose, underlay, every, sentence, and, filled, his, history, with, distortions, and, exaggerations, josephus, mentions, that, in, his, day, there, were, 240, towns, and, villages, scattered, across, upper, and, lower, galilee, some, of, which, he, names, josephus, s, works, are, the, primary, source, for, the, chain, of, jewish, high, priests, during, the, second, temple, period, a, few, of, the, jewish, customs, named, by, him, include, the, practice, of, hanging, a, linen, curtain, at, the, entrance, to, one, s, house, and, the, jewish, custom, to, partake, of, a, sabbath, day, s, meal, around, the, sixth, hour, of, the, day, at, noon, he, notes, also, that, it, was, permissible, for, jewish, men, to, marry, many, wives, polygamy, his, writings, provide, a, significant, extra, biblical, account, of, the, post, exilic, period, of, the, maccabees, the, hasmonean, dynasty, and, the, rise, of, herod, the, great, he, also, describes, the, sadducees, the, pharisees, and, essenes, the, herodian, temple, quirinius, s, census, and, the, zealots, and, such, figures, as, pontius, pilate, herod, the, great, agrippa, i, and, agrippa, ii, john, the, baptist, james, the, brother, of, jesus, and, jesus, josephus, represents, an, important, source, for, studies, of, immediate, post, temple, judaism, and, the, context, of, early, christianity, a, careful, reading, of, josephus, s, writings, and, years, of, excavation, allowed, ehud, netzer, an, archaeologist, from, hebrew, university, to, discover, what, he, considered, to, be, the, location, of, herod, s, tomb, after, searching, for, 35, years, it, was, above, aqueducts, and, pools, at, a, flattened, desert, site, halfway, up, the, hill, to, the, herodium, 12, km, south, of, jerusalem, as, described, in, josephus, s, writings, in, october, 2013, archaeologists, joseph, patrich, and, benjamin, arubas, challenged, the, identification, of, the, tomb, as, that, of, herod, according, to, patrich, and, arubas, the, tomb, is, too, modest, to, be, herod, s, and, has, several, unlikely, features, roi, porat, who, replaced, netzer, as, excavation, leader, after, the, latter, s, death, stood, by, the, identification, josephus, s, writings, provide, the, first, known, source, for, many, stories, considered, as, biblical, history, despite, not, being, found, in, the, bible, or, related, material, these, include, ishmael, as, the, founder, of, the, arabs, the, connection, of, semites, hamites, and, japhetites, to, the, classical, nations, of, the, world, and, the, story, of, the, siege, of, masada, scholars, debate, about, josephus, s, intended, audience, for, example, antiquities, of, the, jews, could, be, written, for, jews, a, few, scholars, from, laqueur, onward, have, suggested, that, josephus, must, have, written, primarily, for, fellow, jews, if, also, secondarily, for, gentiles, the, most, common, motive, suggested, is, repentance, in, later, life, he, felt, so, bad, about, the, traitorous, war, that, he, needed, to, demonstrate, his, loyalty, to, jewish, history, law, and, culture, however, josephus, s, countless, incidental, remarks, explaining, basic, judean, language, customs, and, laws, assume, a, gentile, audience, he, does, not, expect, his, first, hearers, to, know, anything, about, the, laws, or, judean, origins, the, issue, of, who, would, read, this, multi, volume, work, is, unresolved, other, possible, motives, for, writing, antiquities, could, be, to, dispel, the, misrepresentation, of, jewish, origins, or, as, an, apologetic, to, greek, cities, of, the, diaspora, in, order, to, protect, jews, and, to, roman, authorities, to, garner, their, support, for, the, jews, facing, persecution, josephus, was, a, very, popular, writer, with, christians, in, the, 4th, century, and, beyond, as, an, independent, source, to, the, events, before, during, and, after, the, life, of, jesus, of, nazareth, josephus, was, always, accessible, in, the, greek, reading, eastern, mediterranean, his, works, were, translated, into, latin, but, often, in, abbreviated, form, such, as, pseudo, hegesippus, s, 4th, century, latin, version, of, the, jewish, war, bellum, judaicum, christian, interest, in, the, jewish, war, was, largely, out, of, interest, in, the, downfall, of, the, jews, and, the, second, temple, which, was, widely, considered, divine, punishment, for, the, crime, of, killing, jesus, improvements, in, printing, technology, the, gutenberg, press, led, to, his, works, receiving, a, number, of, new, translations, into, the, vernacular, languages, of, europe, generally, based, on, the, latin, versions, only, in, 1544, did, a, version, of, the, standard, greek, text, become, available, in, french, edited, by, the, dutch, humanist, arnoldus, arlenius, the, first, english, translation, by, thomas, lodge, appeared, in, 1602, with, subsequent, editions, appearing, throughout, the, 17th, century, the, 1544, greek, edition, formed, the, basis, of, the, 1732, english, translation, by, william, whiston, which, achieved, enormous, popularity, in, the, english, speaking, world, it, was, often, the, book, after, the, bible, that, christians, most, frequently, owned, whiston, claimed, that, certain, works, by, josephus, had, a, similar, style, to, the, epistles, of, st, paul, later, editions, of, the, greek, text, include, that, of, benedikt, niese, who, made, a, detailed, examination, of, all, the, available, manuscripts, mainly, from, france, and, spain, henry, st, john, thackeray, and, successors, such, as, ralph, marcus, used, niese, s, version, for, the, loeb, classical, library, edition, widely, used, today, on, the, jewish, side, josephus, was, far, more, obscure, as, he, was, perceived, as, a, traitor, rabbinical, writings, for, a, millennium, after, his, death, e, g, the, mishnah, almost, never, call, out, josephus, by, name, although, they, sometimes, tell, parallel, tales, of, the, same, events, that, josephus, narrated, an, italian, jew, writing, in, the, 10th, century, indirectly, brought, josephus, back, to, prominence, among, jews, he, authored, the, yosippon, which, paraphrases, pseudo, hegesippus, s, latin, version, of, the, jewish, war, a, latin, version, of, antiquities, as, well, as, other, works, the, epitomist, also, adds, in, his, own, snippets, of, history, at, times, jews, generally, distrusted, christian, translations, of, josephus, until, the, haskalah, jewish, enlightenment, in, the, 19th, century, when, sufficiently, neutral, vernacular, language, translations, were, made, kalman, schulman, finally, created, a, hebrew, translation, of, the, greek, text, of, josephus, in, 1863, although, many, rabbis, continued, to, prefer, the, yosippon, version, by, the, 20th, century, jewish, attitudes, toward, josephus, had, softened, as, he, gave, the, jews, a, respectable, place, in, classical, history, various, parts, of, his, work, were, reinterpreted, as, more, inspiring, and, favorable, to, the, jews, than, the, renaissance, translations, by, christians, had, been, notably, the, last, stand, at, masada, described, in, the, jewish, war, which, past, generations, had, deemed, insane, and, fanatical, received, a, more, positive, reinterpretation, as, an, inspiring, call, to, action, in, this, period, the, standard, editio, maior, of, the, various, greek, manuscripts, is, that, of, benedictus, niese, published, 1885, 95, the, text, of, antiquities, is, damaged, in, some, places, in, the, life, niese, follows, mainly, manuscript, p, but, refers, also, to, amw, and, r, henry, st, john, thackeray, for, the, loeb, classical, library, has, a, greek, text, also, mainly, dependent, on, p, andr, pelletier, edited, a, new, greek, text, for, his, translation, of, life, the, ongoing, m, nsteraner, josephus, ausgabe, of, m, nster, university, will, provide, a, new, critical, apparatus, late, old, slavonic, translations, of, the, greek, also, exist, but, these, contain, a, large, number, of, christian, interpolations, author, joseph, raymond, calls, josephus, the, jewish, benedict, arnold, for, betraying, his, own, troops, at, jotapata, while, historian, mary, smallwood, in, the, introduction, to, the, translation, of, the, jewish, war, by, g, a, williamson, writes, was, conceited, not, only, about, his, own, learning, but, also, about, the, opinions, held, of, him, as, commander, both, by, the, galileans, and, by, the, romans, he, was, guilty, of, shocking, duplicity, at, jotapata, saving, himself, by, sacrifice, of, his, companions, he, was, too, naive, to, see, how, he, stood, condemned, out, of, his, own, mouth, for, his, conduct, and, yet, no, words, were, too, harsh, when, he, was, blackening, his, opponents, and, after, landing, however, involuntarily, in, the, roman, camp, he, turned, his, captivity, to, his, own, advantage, and, benefited, for, the, rest, of, his, days, from, his, change, of, side, in, the, preface, to, jewish, wars, josephus, criticizes, historians, who, misrepresent, the, events, of, the, jewish, roman, war, writing, that, they, have, a, mind, to, demonstrate, the, greatness, of, the, romans, while, they, still, diminish, and, lessen, the, actions, of, the, jews, josephus, states, that, his, intention, is, to, correct, this, method, but, that, he, will, not, go, to, the, other, extreme, will, prosecute, the, actions, of, both, parties, with, accuracy, josephus, confesses, he, will, be, unable, to, contain, his, sadness, in, transcribing, these, events, to, illustrate, this, will, have, little, effect, on, his, historiography, josephus, suggests, but, if, any, one, be, inflexible, in, his, censures, of, me, let, him, attribute, the, facts, themselves, to, the, historical, part, and, the, lamentations, to, the, writer, himself, only, his, preface, to, antiquities, offers, his, opinion, early, on, saying, upon, the, whole, a, man, that, will, peruse, this, history, may, principally, learn, from, it, that, all, events, succeed, well, even, to, an, incredible, degree, and, the, reward, of, felicity, is, proposed, by, god, after, inserting, this, attitude, josephus, contradicts, berossus, i, shall, accurately, describe, what, is, contained, in, our, records, in, the, order, of, time, that, belongs, to, them, without, adding, any, thing, to, what, is, therein, contained, or, taking, away, any, thing, therefrom, he, notes, the, difference, between, history, and, philosophy, by, saying, hose, that, read, my, book, may, wonder, how, it, comes, to, pass, that, my, discourse, which, promises, an, account, of, laws, and, historical, facts, contains, so, much, of, philosophy, in, both, works, josephus, emphasizes, that, accuracy, is, crucial, to, historiography, louis, h, feldman, notes, that, in, wars, josephus, commits, himself, to, critical, historiography, but, in, antiquities, josephus, shifts, to, rhetorical, historiography, which, was, the, norm, of, his, time, feldman, notes, further, that, it, is, significant, that, josephus, called, his, later, work, antiquities, literally, archaeology, rather, than, history, in, the, hellenistic, period, archaeology, meant, either, history, from, the, origins, or, archaic, history, thus, his, title, implies, a, jewish, peoples, history, from, their, origins, until, the, time, he, wrote, this, distinction, is, significant, to, feldman, because, in, ancient, times, historians, were, expected, to, write, in, chronological, order, while, antiquarians, wrote, in, a, systematic, order, proceeding, topically, and, logically, and, included, all, relevant, material, for, their, subject, antiquarians, moved, beyond, political, history, to, include, institutions, and, religious, and, private, life, josephus, does, offer, this, wider, perspective, in, antiquities, the, works, of, josephus, are, major, sources, of, our, understanding, of, jewish, life, and, history, during, the, first, century, his, first, work, in, rome, was, an, account, of, the, jewish, war, addressed, to, certain, upper, barbarians, usually, thought, to, be, the, jewish, community, in, mesopotamia, in, his, paternal, tongue, war, i, 3, arguably, the, western, aramaic, language, in, ad, 78, he, finished, a, seven, volume, account, in, greek, known, as, the, jewish, war, latin, bellum, judaicum, or, de, bello, judaico, it, starts, with, the, period, of, the, maccabees, and, concludes, with, accounts, of, the, fall, of, jerusalem, and, the, subsequent, fall, of, the, fortresses, of, herodion, macharont, and, masada, and, the, roman, victory, celebrations, in, rome, the, mopping, up, operations, roman, military, operations, elsewhere, in, the, empire, and, the, uprising, in, cyrene, together, with, the, account, in, his, life, of, some, of, the, same, events, it, also, provides, the, reader, with, an, overview, of, josephus, s, own, part, in, the, events, since, his, return, to, jerusalem, from, a, brief, visit, to, rome, in, the, early, 60s, life, 13, 17, in, the, wake, of, the, suppression, of, the, jewish, revolt, josephus, would, have, witnessed, the, marches, of, titus, s, triumphant, legions, leading, their, jewish, captives, and, carrying, treasures, from, the, despoiled, temple, in, jerusalem, it, was, against, this, background, that, josephus, wrote, his, war, he, blames, the, jewish, war, on, what, he, calls, unrepresentative, and, over, zealous, fanatics, among, the, jews, who, led, the, masses, away, from, their, traditional, aristocratic, leaders, like, himself, with, disastrous, results, for, example, josephus, writes, that, simon, was, a, greater, terror, to, the, people, than, the, romans, themselves, josephus, also, blames, some, of, the, roman, governors, of, judea, representing, them, as, corrupt, and, incompetent, administrators, the, next, work, by, josephus, is, his, 21, volume, antiquities, of, the, jews, completed, during, the, last, year, of, the, reign, of, the, emperor, flavius, domitian, around, 93, or, 94, ad, in, expounding, jewish, history, law, and, custom, he, is, entering, into, many, philosophical, debates, current, in, rome, at, that, time, again, he, offers, an, apologia, for, the, antiquity, and, universal, significance, of, the, jewish, people, josephus,
