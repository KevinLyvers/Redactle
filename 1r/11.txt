introduction, from, any, character, in, movie, history, three, cool, monosyllables, surname, first, a, little, curtly, as, befits, a, former, naval, commander, and, then, as, if, in, afterthought, the, first, name, followed, by, the, surname, again, connery, carried, it, off, with, icily, disdainful, style, in, full, evening, dress, with, a, cigarette, hanging, from, his, lips, the,

sharks, managed, to, pass, through, it, he, had, to, abandon, the, pool, immediately, although, bond, had, made, him, a, star, connery, grew, tired, of, the, role, and, the, pressure, the, franchise, put, on, him, saying, fed, up, to, here, with, the, whole, bond, bit, and, i, have, always, hated, that, damned, james, bond, i, d, like, to, kill, him, michael, caine, said, of, the, situation, if, you, were, his, friend, in, these, early, days, you, didn, t, raise, the, subject, of, bond, he, was, and, is, a, much, better, actor, than, just, playing, james, bond, but, he, became, synonymous, with, bond, he, d, be, walking, down, the, street, and, people, would, say, look, there, s, james, bond, that, was, particularly, upsetting, to, him, while, making, the, bond, films, connery, also, starred, in, other, films, such, as, alfred, hitchcock, s, marnie, 1964, and, sidney, lumet, s, the, hill, 1965, which, film, critic, peter, bradshaw, regards, as, his, two, great, non, bond,

also, shocked, many, people, at, the, time, by, asking, to, see, a, script, something, he, did, because, he, was, worried, about, being, typecast, as, a, spy, and, he, did, not, want, to, do, a, variation, of, north, by, northwest, or, notorious, when, told, by, hitchcock, s, agent, that, cary, grant, had, not, asked, to, see, even, one, of, hitchcock, s, scripts, connery, replied, i, m, not, cary, grant, hitchcock, and, connery, got, on, well, during, filming, and, connery, said, he, was, happy, with, the, film, with, certain, reservations, in, the, hill, connery, wanted, to, act, in, something, that, wasn, t, bond, related, and, he, used, his, leverage, as, a, star, to, feature, in, it, while, the, film, wasn, t, a, financial, success, it, was, a, critical, one, debuting, at, the, cannes, film, festival, winning, best, screenplay, the, first, of, five, films, he, made, with, lumet, connery, considered, him, to, be, one, of, his, favourite, directors, the, respect, was, mutual, with, lumet, saying, of, connery, s, performance, in, the, hill, the, thing, that, was, apparent, to, me, and, to, most, directors, was, how, much, talent, and, ability, it, takes, to, play, that,
