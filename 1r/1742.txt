alexander, graham, bell, r, e, m, born, alexander, bell, march, 3, 1847, august, 2, 1922, was, a, scottish, born, canadian, american, inventor, scientist, and, engineer, who, is, credited, with, patenting, the, first, practical, telephone, he, also, co, founded, the, american, telephone, and, telegraph, company, at, t, in, 1885, bell, s, father, grandfather, and, brother, had, all, been, associated, with, work, on, elocution, and, speech, and, both, his, mother, and, wife, were, deaf, profoundly, influencing, bell, s, life, s, work, his, research, on, hearing, and, speech, further, led, him, to, experiment, with, hearing, devices, which, eventually, culminated, in, his, being, awarded, the, first, u, s, patent, for, the, telephone, on, march, 7, 1876, bell, considered, his, invention, an, intrusion, on, his, real, work, as, a, scientist, and, refused, to, have, a, telephone, in, his, study, many, other, inventions, marked, bell, s, later, life, including, groundbreaking, work, in, optical, telecommunications, hydrofoils, and, aeronautics, bell, also, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, national, geographic, society, and, its, magazine, while, serving, as, its, second, president, from, 1898, to, 1903, beyond, his, work, in, engineering, bell, had, a, deep, interest, in, the, emerging, science, of, heredity, his, work, in, this, area, has, been, called, the, soundest, and, most, useful, study, of, human, heredity, proposed, in, nineteenth, century, america, bell, s, most, notable, contribution, to, basic, science, as, distinct, from, invention, bell, was, born, in, edinburgh, scotland, on, march, 3, 1847, the, family, home, was, at, south, charlotte, street, and, has, a, stone, inscription, marking, it, as, bell, s, birthplace, he, had, two, brothers, melville, james, bell, 1845, 1870, and, edward, charles, bell, 1848, 1867, both, of, whom, died, of, tuberculosis, his, father, was, alexander, melville, bell, a, phonetician, and, his, mother, was, eliza, grace, bell, n, e, symonds, born, as, just, alexander, bell, at, age, 10, he, made, a, plea, to, his, father, to, have, a, middle, name, like, his, two, brothers, for, his, 11th, birthday, his, father, acquiesced, and, allowed, him, to, adopt, the, name, graham, chosen, out, of, respect, for, alexander, graham, a, canadian, being, treated, by, his, father, who, had, become, a, family, friend, to, close, relatives, and, friends, he, remained, aleck, bell, and, his, siblings, attended, a, presbyterian, church, in, their, youth, as, a, child, bell, displayed, a, curiosity, about, his, world, he, gathered, botanical, specimens, and, ran, experiments, at, an, early, age, his, best, friend, was, ben, herdman, a, neighbor, whose, family, operated, a, flour, mill, at, the, age, of, 12, bell, built, a, homemade, device, that, combined, rotating, paddles, with, sets, of, nail, brushes, creating, a, simple, dehusking, machine, that, was, put, into, operation, at, the, mill, and, used, steadily, for, a, number, of, years, in, return, ben, s, father, john, herdman, gave, both, boys, the, run, of, a, small, workshop, in, which, to, invent, from, his, early, years, bell, showed, a, sensitive, nature, and, a, talent, for, art, poetry, and, music, that, his, mother, encouraged, with, no, formal, training, he, mastered, the, piano, and, became, the, family, s, pianist, though, normally, quiet, and, introspective, he, reveled, in, mimicry, and, voice, tricks, akin, to, ventriloquism, that, entertained, family, guests, bell, was, also, deeply, affected, by, his, mother, s, gradual, deafness, she, began, to, lose, her, hearing, when, he, was, 12, and, learned, a, manual, finger, language, so, he, could, sit, at, her, side, and, tap, out, silently, the, conversations, swirling, around, the, family, parlor, he, also, developed, a, technique, of, speaking, in, clear, modulated, tones, directly, into, his, mother, s, forehead, whereby, she, would, hear, him, with, reasonable, clarity, bell, s, preoccupation, with, his, mother, s, deafness, led, him, to, study, acoustics, his, family, was, long, associated, with, the, teaching, of, elocution, his, grandfather, alexander, bell, in, london, his, uncle, in, dublin, and, his, father, in, edinburgh, were, all, elocutionists, his, father, published, a, variety, of, works, on, the, subject, several, of, which, are, still, well, known, especially, the, standard, elocutionist, 1860, which, appeared, in, edinburgh, in, 1868, the, standard, elocutionist, appeared, in, 168, british, editions, and, sold, over, 250, 000, copies, in, the, united, states, alone, it, explains, methods, to, instruct, deaf, mutes, as, they, were, then, known, to, articulate, words, and, read, other, people, s, lip, movements, to, decipher, meaning, bell, s, father, taught, him, and, his, brothers, not, only, to, write, visible, speech, but, to, identify, any, symbol, and, its, accompanying, sound, bell, became, so, proficient, that, he, became, a, part, of, his, father, s, public, demonstrations, and, astounded, audiences, with, his, abilities, he, could, decipher, visible, speech, representing, virtually, every, language, including, latin, scottish, gaelic, and, even, sanskrit, accurately, reciting, written, tracts, without, any, prior, knowledge, of, their, pronunciation, as, a, young, child, bell, like, his, brothers, was, schooled, at, home, by, his, father, at, an, early, age, he, was, enrolled, at, the, royal, high, school, edinburgh, he, left, at, age, 15, having, completed, only, the, first, four, forms, his, school, record, was, undistinguished, marked, by, absenteeism, and, lackluster, grades, his, main, interest, remained, in, the, sciences, especially, biology, while, he, treated, other, school, subjects, with, indifference, to, his, father, s, dismay, upon, leaving, school, bell, traveled, to, london, to, live, with, his, grandfather, alexander, bell, on, harrington, square, during, the, year, he, spent, with, his, grandfather, a, love, of, learning, was, born, with, long, hours, spent, in, serious, discussion, and, study, the, elder, bell, took, great, efforts, to, have, his, young, pupil, learn, to, speak, clearly, and, with, conviction, attributes, he, would, need, to, become, a, teacher, himself, at, age, 16, bell, secured, a, position, as, a, pupil, teacher, of, elocution, and, music, at, weston, house, academy, in, elgin, moray, scotland, although, enrolled, as, a, student, in, latin, and, greek, he, instructed, classes, himself, in, return, for, board, and, 10, per, session, the, next, year, he, attended, the, university, of, edinburgh, joining, his, brother, melville, who, had, enrolled, there, the, previous, year, in, 1868, not, long, before, he, departed, for, canada, with, his, family, bell, completed, his, matriculation, exams, and, was, accepted, for, admission, to, university, college, london, bell, s, father, encouraged, his, interest, in, speech, and, in, 1863, took, his, sons, to, see, a, unique, automaton, developed, by, sir, charles, wheatstone, based, on, the, earlier, work, of, baron, wolfgang, von, kempelen, the, rudimentary, mechanical, man, simulated, a, human, voice, bell, was, fascinated, by, the, machine, and, after, he, obtained, a, copy, of, von, kempelen, s, book, published, in, german, and, had, laboriously, translated, it, he, and, melville, built, their, own, automaton, head, their, father, highly, interested, in, their, project, offered, to, pay, for, any, supplies, and, spurred, the, boys, on, with, the, enticement, of, a, big, prize, if, they, were, successful, while, his, brother, constructed, the, throat, and, larynx, bell, tackled, the, more, difficult, task, of, recreating, a, realistic, skull, his, efforts, resulted, in, a, remarkably, lifelike, head, that, could, speak, albeit, only, a, few, words, the, boys, would, carefully, adjust, the, lips, and, when, a, bellows, forced, air, through, the, windpipe, a, very, recognizable, mama, ensued, to, the, delight, of, neighbors, who, came, to, see, the, invention, intrigued, by, the, results, of, the, automaton, bell, continued, to, experiment, with, a, live, subject, the, family, s, skye, terrier, trouve, after, he, taught, it, to, growl, continuously, bell, would, reach, into, its, mouth, and, manipulate, the, dog, s, lips, and, vocal, cords, to, produce, a, crude, sounding, ow, ah, oo, ga, ma, ma, with, little, convincing, visitors, believed, his, dog, could, articulate, how, are, you, grandmama, indicative, of, his, playful, nature, his, experiments, convinced, onlookers, that, they, saw, a, talking, dog, these, initial, forays, into, experimentation, with, sound, led, bell, to, undertake, his, first, serious, work, on, the, transmission, of, sound, using, tuning, forks, to, explore, resonance, at, age, 19, bell, wrote, a, report, on, his, work, and, sent, it, to, philologist, alexander, ellis, a, colleague, of, his, father, ellis, immediately, wrote, back, indicating, that, the, experiments, were, similar, to, existing, work, in, germany, and, also, lent, bell, a, copy, of, hermann, von, helmholtz, s, work, the, sensations, of, tone, as, a, physiological, basis, for, the, theory, of, music, dismayed, to, find, that, groundbreaking, work, had, already, been, undertaken, by, helmholtz, who, had, conveyed, vowel, sounds, by, means, of, a, similar, tuning, fork, contraption, bell, pored, over, the, book, working, from, his, own, erroneous, mistranslation, of, a, french, edition, bell, fortuitously, then, made, a, deduction, that, would, underpin, all, his, future, work, on, transmitting, sound, reporting, without, knowing, much, about, the, subject, it, seemed, to, me, that, if, vowel, sounds, could, be, produced, by, electrical, means, so, could, consonants, so, could, articulate, speech, he, also, later, remarked, i, thought, that, helmholtz, had, done, it, and, that, my, failure, was, due, only, to, my, ignorance, of, electricity, it, was, a, valuable, blunder, if, i, had, been, able, to, read, german, in, those, days, i, might, never, have, commenced, my, experiments, in, 1865, when, the, bell, family, moved, to, london, bell, returned, to, weston, house, as, an, assistant, master, and, in, his, spare, hours, continued, experiments, on, sound, using, a, minimum, of, laboratory, equipment, bell, concentrated, on, experimenting, with, electricity, to, convey, sound, and, later, installed, a, telegraph, wire, from, his, room, in, somerset, college, to, that, of, a, friend, throughout, late, 1867, his, health, faltered, mainly, through, exhaustion, his, brother, edward, was, similarly, affected, by, tuberculosis, while, bell, recovered, by, then, referring, to, himself, in, correspondence, as, a, g, bell, and, served, the, next, year, as, an, instructor, at, somerset, college, bath, england, his, brother, s, condition, deteriorated, edward, never, recovered, upon, his, brother, s, death, bell, returned, home, in, 1867, melville, had, married, and, moved, out, with, aspirations, to, obtain, a, degree, at, university, college, london, bell, considered, his, next, years, preparation, for, the, degree, examinations, devoting, his, spare, time, to, studying, helping, his, father, in, visible, speech, demonstrations, and, lectures, brought, bell, to, susanna, e, hull, s, private, school, for, the, deaf, in, south, kensington, london, his, first, two, pupils, were, deaf, mute, girls, who, made, remarkable, progress, under, his, tutelage, while, melville, seemed, to, achieve, success, on, many, fronts, including, opening, his, own, elocution, school, applying, for, a, patent, on, an, invention, and, starting, a, family, bell, continued, as, a, teacher, in, may, 1870, melville, died, from, complications, of, tuberculosis, causing, a, family, crisis, his, father, had, also, experienced, a, debilitating, illness, earlier, in, life, and, been, restored, to, health, by, convalescence, in, newfoundland, bell, s, parents, embarked, upon, a, long, planned, move, when, they, realized, that, their, remaining, son, was, also, sickly, acting, decisively, alexander, melville, bell, asked, bell, to, arrange, for, the, sale, of, all, the, family, property, conclude, all, his, brother, s, affairs, bell, took, on, his, last, student, curing, a, pronounced, lisp, and, join, his, father, and, mother, in, setting, out, for, the, new, world, reluctantly, bell, also, had, to, conclude, a, relationship, with, marie, eccleston, who, as, he, had, surmised, was, not, prepared, to, leave, england, with, him, in, 1870, 23, year, old, bell, traveled, with, his, parents, and, his, brother, s, widow, caroline, margaret, ottaway, to, paris, ontario, to, stay, with, thomas, henderson, a, baptist, minister, and, family, friend, the, bells, soon, purchased, a, farm, of, 10, 5, acres, 4, 2, ha, at, tutelo, heights, now, called, tutela, heights, near, brantford, ontario, the, property, consisted, of, an, orchard, large, farmhouse, stable, pigsty, hen, house, and, a, carriage, house, which, bordered, the, grand, river, at, the, homestead, bell, set, up, a, workshop, in, the, converted, carriage, house, near, what, he, called, his, dreaming, place, a, large, hollow, nestled, in, trees, at, the, back, of, the, property, above, the, river, despite, his, frail, condition, upon, arriving, in, canada, bell, found, the, climate, and, environs, to, his, liking, and, rapidly, improved, he, continued, his, interest, in, the, study, of, the, human, voice, and, when, he, discovered, the, six, nations, reserve, across, the, river, at, onondaga, learned, the, mohawk, language, and, translated, its, unwritten, vocabulary, into, visible, speech, symbols, for, his, work, bell, was, awarded, the, title, of, honorary, chief, and, participated, in, a, ceremony, where, he, donned, a, mohawk, headdress, and, danced, traditional, dances, after, setting, up, his, workshop, bell, continued, experiments, based, on, helmholtz, s, work, with, electricity, and, sound, he, also, modified, a, melodeon, a, type, of, pump, organ, to, transmit, its, music, electrically, over, a, distance, once, the, family, was, settled, bell, and, his, father, made, plans, to, establish, a, teaching, practice, and, in, 1871, he, accompanied, his, father, to, montreal, where, melville, was, offered, a, position, to, teach, his, system, of, visible, speech, bell, s, father, was, invited, by, sarah, fuller, principal, of, the, boston, school, for, deaf, mutes, later, to, become, the, public, horace, mann, school, for, the, deaf, to, introduce, the, visible, speech, system, by, providing, training, for, fuller, s, instructors, but, he, declined, the, post, in, favor, of, his, son, traveling, to, boston, in, april, 1871, bell, proved, successful, in, training, the, school, s, instructors, he, was, asked, to, repeat, the, program, at, the, american, asylum, for, deaf, mutes, in, hartford, connecticut, and, the, clarke, school, for, the, deaf, in, northampton, massachusetts, returning, home, to, brantford, after, six, months, abroad, bell, continued, his, experiments, with, his, harmonic, telegraph, the, basic, concept, behind, his, device, was, that, messages, could, be, sent, through, a, single, wire, if, each, was, transmitted, at, a, different, pitch, but, work, on, both, the, transmitter, and, receiver, was, needed, unsure, of, his, future, he, contemplated, returning, to, london, to, complete, his, studies, but, decided, to, return, to, boston, as, a, teacher, his, father, helped, him, set, up, his, private, practice, by, contacting, gardiner, greene, hubbard, the, president, of, the, clarke, school, for, the, deaf, for, a, recommendation, teaching, his, father, s, system, in, october, 1872, alexander, bell, opened, his, school, of, vocal, physiology, and, mechanics, of, speech, in, boston, which, attracted, a, large, number, of, deaf, pupils, with, his, first, class, numbering, 30, students, while, he, was, working, as, a, private, tutor, one, of, his, pupils, was, helen, keller, who, came, to, him, as, a, young, child, unable, to, see, hear, or, speak, she, later, said, that, bell, dedicated, his, life, to, the, penetration, of, that, inhuman, silence, which, separates, and, estranges, in, 1893, keller, performed, the, sod, breaking, ceremony, for, the, construction, of, bell, s, new, volta, bureau, dedicated, to, the, increase, and, diffusion, of, knowledge, relating, to, the, deaf, throughout, his, life, bell, sought, to, integrate, the, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, with, the, hearing, world, he, encouraged, speech, therapy, and, lipreading, over, sign, language, he, outlined, this, in, an, 1898, paper, detailing, his, belief, that, with, resources, and, effort, the, deaf, could, be, taught, to, read, lips, and, speak, known, as, oralism, enabling, their, integration, with, wider, society, members, of, the, deaf, community, have, criticized, bell, for, supporting, ideas, that, could, cause, the, closure, of, dozens, of, deaf, schools, and, what, some, consider, eugenicist, ideas, bell, did, not, support, a, ban, on, deaf, people, marrying, each, other, an, idea, articulated, by, the, national, association, of, the, deaf, united, states, but, in, his, memoir, memoir, upon, the, formation, of, a, deaf, variety, of, the, human, race, he, observed, that, if, deaf, people, tended, to, marry, other, deaf, people, this, could, result, in, the, emergence, of, a, deaf, race, ultimately, in, 1880, the, second, international, congress, on, education, of, the, deaf, passed, a, resolution, preferring, the, teaching, of, oral, communication, rather, than, signing, in, schools, in, 1872, bell, became, professor, of, vocal, physiology, and, elocution, at, the, boston, university, school, of, oratory, during, this, period, he, alternated, between, boston, and, brantford, spending, summers, in, his, canadian, home, at, boston, university, bell, was, swept, up, by, the, excitement, engendered, by, the, many, scientists, and, inventors, living, in, the, city, he, continued, his, research, in, sound, and, endeavored, to, find, a, way, to, transmit, musical, notes, and, articulate, speech, but, although, absorbed, by, his, experiments, he, found, it, difficult, to, devote, enough, time, to, experimentation, with, days, and, evenings, occupied, by, his, teaching, and, private, classes, bell, began, to, stay, awake, late, into, the, night, running, experiment, after, experiment, in, rented, facilities, at, his, boarding, house, keeping, night, owl, hours, he, worried, that, his, work, would, be, discovered, and, took, great, pains, to, lock, up, his, notebooks, and, laboratory, equipment, bell, had, a, specially, made, table, where, he, could, place, his, notes, and, equipment, inside, a, locking, cover, his, health, deteriorated, as, he, had, severe, headaches, returning, to, boston, in, fall, 1873, bell, made, a, far, reaching, decision, to, concentrate, on, his, experiments, in, sound, giving, up, his, lucrative, private, boston, practice, bell, retained, only, two, students, six, year, old, georgie, sanders, deaf, from, birth, and, 15, year, old, mabel, hubbard, each, played, an, important, role, in, the, next, developments, georgie, s, father, thomas, sanders, a, wealthy, businessman, offered, bell, a, place, to, stay, in, nearby, salem, with, georgie, s, grandmother, complete, with, a, room, to, experiment, although, the, offer, was, made, by, georgie, s, mother, and, followed, the, year, long, arrangement, in, 1872, where, her, son, and, his, nurse, had, moved, to, quarters, next, to, bell, s, boarding, house, it, was, clear, that, mr, sanders, backed, the, proposal, the, arrangement, was, for, teacher, and, student, to, continue, their, work, together, with, free, room, and, board, thrown, in, mabel, was, a, bright, attractive, girl, ten, years, bell, s, junior, who, became, the, object, of, his, affection, having, lost, her, hearing, after, a, near, fatal, bout, of, scarlet, fever, close, to, her, fifth, birthday, she, had, learned, to, read, lips, but, her, father, gardiner, greene, hubbard, bell, s, benefactor, and, personal, friend, wanted, her, to, work, directly, with, her, teacher, by, 1874, bell, s, initial, work, on, the, harmonic, telegraph, had, entered, a, formative, stage, with, progress, made, both, at, his, new, boston, laboratory, a, rented, facility, and, at, his, family, home, in, canada, a, big, success, while, working, that, summer, in, brantford, bell, experimented, with, a, phonautograph, a, pen, like, machine, that, could, draw, shapes, of, sound, waves, on, smoked, glass, by, tracing, their, vibrations, bell, thought, it, might, be, possible, to, generate, undulating, electrical, currents, that, corresponded, to, sound, waves, he, also, thought, that, multiple, metal, reeds, tuned, to, different, frequencies, like, a, harp, would, be, able, to, convert, the, undulating, currents, back, into, sound, but, he, had, no, working, model, to, demonstrate, the, feasibility, of, these, ideas, in, 1874, telegraph, message, traffic, was, rapidly, expanding, and, in, the, words, of, western, union, president, william, orton, had, become, the, nervous, system, of, commerce, orton, had, contracted, with, inventors, thomas, edison, and, elisha, gray, to, find, a, way, to, send, multiple, telegraph, messages, on, each, telegraph, line, to, avoid, the, great, cost, of, constructing, new, lines, when, bell, mentioned, to, gardiner, hubbard, and, thomas, sanders, that, he, was, working, on, a, method, of, sending, multiple, tones, on, a, telegraph, wire, using, a, multi, reed, device, the, two, began, to, financially, support, bell, s, experiments, patent, matters, were, handled, by, hubbard, s, patent, attorney, anthony, pollok, in, march, 1875, bell, and, pollok, visited, the, scientist, joseph, henry, then, the, director, of, the, smithsonian, institution, to, ask, his, advice, on, the, electrical, multi, reed, apparatus, that, bell, hoped, would, transmit, the, human, voice, by, telegraph, henry, said, bell, had, the, germ, of, a, great, invention, when, bell, said, that, he, lacked, the, necessary, knowledge, henry, replied, get, it, that, declaration, greatly, encouraged, bell, to, keep, trying, even, though, he, had, neither, the, equipment, needed, to, continue, his, experiments, nor, the, ability, to, create, a, working, model, of, his, ideas, but, a, chance, meeting, in, 1874, between, bell, and, thomas, a, watson, an, experienced, electrical, designer, and, mechanic, at, the, electrical, machine, shop, of, charles, williams, changed, that, with, financial, support, from, sanders, and, hubbard, bell, hired, watson, as, his, assistant, and, the, two, experimented, with, acoustic, telegraphy, on, june, 2, 1875, watson, accidentally, plucked, one, of, the, reeds, and, bell, at, the, receiving, end, of, the, wire, heard, the, reed, s, overtones, that, would, be, necessary, for, transmitting, speech, that, demonstrated, to, bell, that, only, one, reed, or, armature, was, necessary, not, multiple, reeds, this, led, to, the, gallows, sound, powered, telephone, which, could, transmit, indistinct, voice, like, sounds, but, not, clear, speech, in, 1875, bell, developed, an, acoustic, telegraph, and, drew, up, a, patent, application, for, it, since, he, had, agreed, to, share, u, s, profits, with, his, investors, gardiner, hubbard, and, thomas, sanders, bell, requested, that, an, associate, in, ontario, george, brown, attempt, to, patent, it, in, britain, instructing, his, lawyers, to, apply, for, a, patent, in, the, u, s, only, after, they, received, word, from, britain, britain, issued, patents, only, for, discoveries, not, previously, patented, elsewhere, meanwhile, elisha, gray, was, also, experimenting, with, acoustic, telegraphy, and, thought, of, a, way, to, transmit, speech, using, a, water, transmitter, on, february, 14, 1876, gray, filed, a, caveat, with, the, u, s, patent, office, for, a, telephone, design, that, used, a, water, transmitter, that, same, morning, bell, s, lawyer, filed, bell, s, application, with, the, patent, office, there, is, considerable, debate, about, who, arrived, first, and, gray, later, challenged, the, primacy, of, bell, s, patent, bell, was, in, boston, on, february, 14, and, did, not, arrive, in, washington, until, february, 26, on, march, 7, 1876, the, u, s, patent, office, issued, bell, patent, 174, 465, it, covered, the, method, of, and, apparatus, for, transmitting, vocal, or, other, sounds, telegraphically, by, causing, electrical, undulations, similar, in, form, to, the, vibrations, of, the, air, accompanying, the, said, vocal, or, other, sound, bell, returned, to, boston, that, day, and, the, next, day, resumed, work, drawing, in, his, notebook, a, diagram, similar, to, that, in, gray, s, patent, caveat, on, march, 10, bell, succeeded, in, getting, his, telephone, to, work, using, a, liquid, transmitter, similar, to, gray, s, design, vibration, of, the, diaphragm, caused, a, needle, to, vibrate, in, the, water, varying, the, electrical, resistance, in, the, circuit, when, bell, spoke, the, sentence, mr, watson, come, here, i, want, to, see, you, into, the, liquid, transmitter, watson, listening, at, the, receiving, end, in, an, adjoining, room, heard, the, words, clearly, although, bell, was, and, still, is, accused, of, stealing, the, telephone, from, gray, bell, used, gray, s, water, transmitter, design, only, after, bell, s, patent, had, been, granted, and, only, as, a, proof, of, concept, scientific, experiment, to, prove, to, his, own, satisfaction, that, intelligible, articulate, speech, bell, s, words, could, be, electrically, transmitted, after, march, 1876, bell, focused, on, improving, the, electromagnetic, telephone, and, never, used, gray, s, liquid, transmitter, in, public, demonstrations, or, commercial, use, the, examiner, raised, the, question, of, priority, for, the, variable, resistance, feature, of, the, telephone, before, approving, bell, s, patent, application, he, told, bell, that, his, claim, for, the, variable, resistance, feature, was, also, described, in, gray, s, caveat, bell, pointed, to, a, variable, resistance, device, in, his, previous, application, in, which, he, described, a, cup, of, mercury, not, water, he, had, filed, the, mercury, application, at, the, patent, office, on, february, 25, 1875, long, before, gray, described, the, water, device, in, addition, gray, abandoned, his, caveat, and, because, he, did, not, contest, bell, s, priority, the, examiner, approved, bell, s, patent, on, march, 3, 1876, gray, had, reinvented, the, variable, resistance, telephone, but, bell, was, the, first, to, write, down, the, idea, and, test, it, in, a, telephone, the, patent, examiner, zenas, fisk, wilber, later, stated, in, an, affidavit, that, he, was, an, alcoholic, who, was, much, in, debt, to, bell, s, lawyer, marcellus, bailey, with, whom, he, had, served, in, the, civil, war, he, said, he, had, shown, bailey, gray, s, patent, caveat, wilber, also, said, after, bell, arrived, in, washington, d, c, from, boston, that, he, showed, bell, gray, s, caveat, and, that, bell, paid, him, 100, equivalent, to, 2, 800, in, 2023, bell, said, they, discussed, the, patent, only, in, general, terms, although, in, a, letter, to, gray, bell, admitted, that, he, learned, some, of, the, technical, details, bell, denied, in, an, affidavit, that, he, ever, gave, wilber, any, money, on, march, 10, 1876, bell, used, the, instrument, in, boston, to, call, thomas, watson, who, was, in, another, room, but, out, of, earshot, he, said, mr, watson, come, here, i, want, to, see, you, and, watson, soon, appeared, at, his, side, continuing, his, experiments, in, brantford, bell, brought, home, a, working, model, of, his, telephone, on, august, 3, 1876, from, the, telegraph, office, in, brantford, bell, sent, a, telegram, to, the, village, of, mount, pleasant, four, miles, six, kilometres, away, indicating, that, he, was, ready, he, made, a, telephone, call, via, telegraph, wires, and, faint, voices, were, heard, replying, the, following, night, he, amazed, guests, as, well, as, his, family, with, a, call, between, the, bell, homestead, and, the, office, of, the, dominion, telegraph, company, in, brantford, along, an, improvised, wire, strung, up, along, telegraph, lines, and, fences, and, laid, through, a, tunnel, this, time, guests, at, the, household, distinctly, heard, people, in, brantford, reading, and, singing, the, third, test, on, august, 10, 1876, was, made, via, the, telegraph, line, between, brantford, and, paris, ontario, eight, miles, thirteen, kilometres, away, this, test, is, said, by, many, sources, to, be, the, world, s, first, long, distance, call, it, proved, that, the, telephone, could, work, over, long, distances, at, least, as, a, one, way, call, the, first, two, way, reciprocal, conversation, over, a, line, occurred, between, cambridge, and, boston, roughly, 2, 5, miles, on, october, 9, 1876, during, that, conversation, bell, was, on, kilby, street, in, boston, and, watson, was, at, the, offices, of, the, walworth, manufacturing, company, bell, and, his, partners, hubbard, and, sanders, offered, to, sell, the, patent, outright, to, western, union, for, 100, 000, equal, to, 2, 861, 250, today, but, it, did, not, work, according, to, an, apocryphal, story, the, president, of, western, union, balked, countering, that, the, telephone, was, nothing, but, a, toy, two, years, later, he, told, colleagues, that, if, he, could, get, the, patent, for, 25, million, equal, to, 789, 310, 345, today, he, would, consider, it, a, bargain, by, then, the, bell, company, no, longer, wanted, to, sell, the, patent, bell, s, investors, became, millionaires, while, he, fared, well, from, residuals, and, at, one, point, had, assets, of, nearly, 1, million, bell, began, a, series, of, public, demonstrations, and, lectures, to, introduce, the, new, invention, to, the, scientific, community, as, well, as, the, general, public, a, short, time, later, his, demonstration, of, an, early, telephone, prototype, at, the, 1876, centennial, exposition, in, philadelphia, brought, the, telephone, to, international, attention, influential, visitors, to, the, exhibition, included, emperor, pedro, ii, of, brazil, one, of, the, judges, at, the, exhibition, sir, william, thomson, later, lord, kelvin, a, renowned, scottish, scientist, described, the, telephone, as, the, greatest, by, far, of, all, the, marvels, of, the, electric, telegraph, on, january, 14, 1878, at, osborne, house, on, the, isle, of, wight, bell, demonstrated, the, device, to, queen, victoria, placing, calls, to, cowes, southampton, and, london, these, were, the, first, publicly, witnessed, long, distance, telephone, calls, in, the, uk, the, queen, found, the, process, quite, extraordinary, although, the, sound, was, rather, faint, she, later, asked, to, buy, the, equipment, that, was, used, but, bell, offered, to, make, a, set, of, telephones, specifically, for, her, the, bell, telephone, company, was, created, in, 1877, and, by, 1886, more, than, 150, 000, people, in, the, u, s, owned, telephones, bell, company, engineers, made, numerous, other, improvements, to, the, telephone, which, emerged, as, one, of, the, most, successful, products, ever, in, 1879, the, company, acquired, edison, s, patents, for, the, carbon, microphone, from, western, union, this, made, the, telephone, practical, for, longer, distances, and, it, was, no, longer, necessary, to, shout, to, be, heard, at, the, receiving, telephone, pedro, ii, of, brazil, was, the, first, person, to, buy, stock, in, the, bell, telephone, company, one, of, the, first, telephones, in, a, private, residence, was, installed, in, his, palace, in, petr, polis, his, summer, retreat, forty, miles, sixty, four, kilometres, from, rio, de, janeiro, in, january, 1915, bell, made, the, first, ceremonial, transcontinental, telephone, call, calling, from, the, at, t, head, office, at, 15, dey, street, in, new, york, city, bell, was, heard, by, thomas, watson, at, 333, grant, avenue, in, san, francisco, the, new, york, times, reported, on, october, 9, 1876, alexander, graham, bell, and, thomas, a, watson, talked, by, telephone, to, each, other, over, a, two, mile, wire, stretched, between, cambridge, and, boston, it, was, the, first, wire, conversation, ever, held, yesterday, afternoon, the, same, two, men, talked, by, telephone, to, each, other, over, a, 3, 400, mile, wire, between, new, york, and, san, francisco, dr, bell, the, veteran, inventor, of, the, telephone, was, in, new, york, and, mr, watson, his, former, associate, was, on, the, other, side, of, the, continent, as, is, sometimes, common, in, scientific, discoveries, simultaneous, developments, occurred, as, evidenced, by, a, number, of, inventors, who, were, at, work, on, the, telephone, over, 18, years, the, bell, telephone, company, faced, 587, court, challenges, to, its, patents, including, five, that, went, to, the, u, s, supreme, court, but, none, was, successful, in, establishing, priority, over, bell, s, original, patent, and, the, bell, telephone, company, never, lost, a, case, that, had, proceeded, to, a, final, trial, stage, bell, s, laboratory, notes, and, family, letters, were, the, key, to, establishing, a, long, lineage, to, his, experiments, the, bell, company, lawyers, successfully, fought, off, myriad, lawsuits, generated, initially, around, the, challenges, by, elisha, gray, and, amos, dolbear, in, personal, correspondence, to, bell, both, gray, and, dolbear, had, acknowledged, his, prior, work, which, considerably, weakened, their, later, claims, on, january, 13, 1887, the, u, s, government, moved, to, annul, the, patent, issued, to, bell, on, the, grounds, of, fraud, and, misrepresentation, after, a, series, of, decisions, and, reversals, the, bell, company, won, a, decision, in, the, supreme, court, though, a, couple, of, the, original, claims, from, the, lower, court, cases, were, left, undecided, by, the, time, the, trial, had, wound, its, way, through, nine, years, of, legal, battles, the, u, s, prosecuting, attorney, had, died, and, the, two, bell, patents, no, 174, 465, dated, march, 7, 1876, and, no, 186, 787, dated, january, 30, 1877, were, no, longer, in, effect, although, the, presiding, judges, agreed, to, continue, the, proceedings, due, to, the, case, s, importance, as, a, precedent, with, a, change, in, administration, and, charges, of, conflict, of, interest, on, both, sides, arising, from, the, original, trial, the, u, s, attorney, general, dropped, the, lawsuit, on, november, 30, 1897, leaving, several, issues, undecided, on, the, merits, during, a, deposition, filed, for, the, 1887, trial, italian, inventor, antonio, meucci, also, claimed, to, have, created, the, first, working, model, of, a, telephone, in, italy, in, 1834, in, 1886, in, the, first, of, three, cases, in, which, he, was, involved, meucci, took, the, stand, as, a, witness, in, hope, of, establishing, his, invention, s, priority, meucci, s, testimony, was, disputed, due, to, lack, of, material, evidence, for, his, inventions, as, his, working, models, were, purportedly, lost, at, the, laboratory, of, american, district, telegraph, adt, of, new, york, which, was, incorporated, as, a, subsidiary, of, western, union, in, 1901, meucci, s, work, like, that, of, many, other, inventors, of, the, period, was, based, on, earlier, acoustic, principles, and, despite, evidence, of, earlier, experiments, the, final, case, involving, meucci, was, eventually, dropped, upon, meucci, s, death, but, due, to, the, efforts, of, congressman, vito, fossella, on, june, 11, 2002, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, stated, that, meucci, s, work, in, the, invention, of, the, telephone, should, be, acknowledged, this, did, not, put, an, end, to, the, still, contentious, issue, some, modern, scholars, do, not, agree, that, bell, s, work, on, the, telephone, was, influenced, by, meucci, s, inventions, the, value, of, bell, s, patent, was, acknowledged, throughout, the, world, and, patent, applications, were, made, in, most, major, countries, when, bell, delayed, the, german, patent, application, the, electrical, firm, siemens, halske, set, up, a, rival, manufacturer, of, bell, telephones, under, its, own, patent, siemens, produced, near, identical, copies, of, the, bell, telephone, without, having, to, pay, royalties, the, establishment, of, the, international, bell, telephone, company, in, brussels, belgium, in, 1880, as, well, as, a, series, of, agreements, in, other, countries, eventually, consolidated, a, global, telephone, operation, the, strain, put, on, bell, by, his, constant, appearances, in, court, necessitated, by, the, legal, battles, eventually, resulted, in, his, resignation, from, the, company, on, july, 11, 1877, a, few, days, after, the, bell, telephone, company, was, established, bell, married, mabel, hubbard, 1857, 1923, at, the, hubbard, estate, in, cambridge, massachusetts, his, wedding, present, to, his, bride, was, to, turn, over, 1, 487, of, his, 1, 497, shares, in, the, newly, formed, bell, telephone, company, shortly, thereafter, the, newlyweds, embarked, on, a, year, long, honeymoon, in, europe, during, that, excursion, bell, took, a, handmade, model, of, his, telephone, with, him, making, it, a, working, holiday, the, courtship, had, begun, years, earlier, however, bell, waited, until, he, was, more, financially, secure, before, marrying, although, the, telephone, appeared, to, be, an, instant, success, it, was, not, initially, a, profitable, venture, and, bell, s, main, sources, of, income, were, from, lectures, until, after, 1897, one, unusual, request, exacted, by, his, fianc, e, was, that, he, use, alec, rather, than, the, family, s, earlier, familiar, name, of, aleck, from, 1876, he, would, sign, his, name, alec, bell, they, had, four, children, the, bell, family, home, was, in, cambridge, massachusetts, until, 1880, when, bell, s, father, in, law, bought, a, house, in, washington, d, c, in, 1882, he, bought, a, home, in, the, same, city, for, bell, s, family, so, they, could, be, with, him, while, he, attended, to, the, numerous, court, cases, involving, patent, disputes, bell, was, a, british, subject, throughout, his, early, life, in, scotland, and, later, in, canada, until, 1882, when, he, became, a, naturalized, citizen, of, the, united, states, in, 1915, he, characterized, his, status, as, i, am, not, one, of, those, hyphenated, americans, who, claim, allegiance, to, two, countries, despite, this, declaration, bell, has, been, proudly, claimed, as, a, native, son, by, all, three, countries, he, resided, in, the, united, states, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, by, 1885, a, new, summer, retreat, was, contemplated, that, summer, the, bells, had, a, vacation, on, cape, breton, island, in, nova, scotia, canada, spending, time, at, the, small, village, of, baddeck, returning, in, 1886, bell, started, building, an, estate, on, a, point, across, from, baddeck, overlooking, bras, d, or, lake, by, 1889, a, large, house, christened, the, lodge, was, completed, and, two, years, later, a, larger, complex, of, buildings, including, a, new, laboratory, were, begun, that, the, bells, would, name, beinn, bhreagh, gaelic, beautiful, mountain, after, bell, s, ancestral, scottish, highlands, bell, also, built, the, bell, boatyard, on, the, estate, employing, up, to, 40, people, building, experimental, craft, as, well, as, wartime, lifeboats, and, workboats, for, the, royal, canadian, navy, and, pleasure, craft, for, the, bell, family, he, was, an, enthusiastic, boater, and, bell, and, his, family, sailed, or, rowed, a, long, series, of, vessels, on, bras, d, or, lake, ordering, additional, vessels, from, the, h, w, embree, and, sons, boatyard, in, port, hawkesbury, nova, scotia, in, his, final, and, some, of, his, most, productive, years, bell, split, his, residency, between, washington, d, c, where, he, and, his, family, initially, resided, for, most, of, the, year, and, beinn, bhreagh, where, they, spent, increasing, amounts, of, time, until, the, end, of, his, life, bell, and, his, family, would, alternate, between, the, two, homes, but, beinn, bhreagh, would, over, the, next, 30, years, become, more, than, a, summer, home, as, bell, became, so, absorbed, in, his, experiments, that, his, annual, stays, lengthened, both, mabel, and, bell, became, immersed, in, the, baddeck, community, and, were, accepted, by, the, villagers, as, their, own, the, bells, were, still, in, residence, at, beinn, bhreagh, when, the, halifax, explosion, occurred, on, december, 6, 1917, mabel, and, bell, mobilized, the, community, to, help, victims, in, halifax, although, alexander, graham, bell, is, most, often, associated, with, the, invention, of, the, telephone, his, interests, were, extremely, varied, according, to, one, of, his, biographers, charlotte, gray, bell, s, work, ranged, unfettered, across, the, scientific, landscape, and, he, often, went, to, bed, voraciously, reading, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, scouring, it, for, new, areas, of, interest, the, range, of, bell, s, inventive, genius, is, represented, only, in, part, by, the, 18, patents, granted, in, his, name, alone, and, the, 12, he, shared, with, his, collaborators, these, included, 14, for, the, telephone, and, telegraph, four, for, the, photophone, one, for, the, phonograph, five, for, aerial, vehicles, four, for, hydroairplanes, and, two, for, selenium, cells, bell, s, inventions, spanned, a, wide, range, of, interests, and, included, a, metal, jacket, to, assist, in, breathing, the, audiometer, to, detect, minor, hearing, problems, a, device, to, locate, icebergs, investigations, on, how, to, separate, salt, from, seawater, and, work, on, finding, alternative, fuels, bell, worked, extensively, in, medical, research, and, invented, techniques, for, teaching, speech, to, the, deaf, during, his, volta, laboratory, period, bell, and, his, associates, considered, impressing, a, magnetic, field, on, a, record, as, a, means, of, reproducing, sound, although, the, trio, briefly, experimented, with, the, concept, they, could, not, develop, a, workable, prototype, they, abandoned, the, idea, never, realizing, they, had, glimpsed, a, basic, principle, which, would, one, day, find, its, application, in, the, tape, recorder, the, hard, disc, and, floppy, disc, drive, and, other, magnetic, media, bell, s, own, home, used, a, primitive, form, of, air, conditioning, in, which, fans, blew, currents, of, air, across, great, blocks, of, ice, he, also, anticipated, modern, concerns, with, fuel, shortages, and, industrial, pollution, methane, gas, he, reasoned, could, be, produced, from, the, waste, of, farms, and, factories, at, his, canadian, estate, in, nova, scotia, he, experimented, with, composting, toilets, and, devices, to, capture, water, from, the, atmosphere, in, a, magazine, article, published, in, 1917, he, reflected, on, the, possibility, of, using, solar, energy, to, heat, houses, bell, and, his, assistant, charles, sumner, tainter, jointly, invented, a, wireless, telephone, named, a, photophone, which, allowed, for, the, transmission, of, both, sounds, and, normal, human, conversations, on, a, beam, of, light, both, men, later, became, full, associates, in, the, volta, laboratory, association, on, june, 21, 1880, bell, s, assistant, transmitted, a, wireless, voice, telephone, message, a, considerable, distance, from, the, roof, of, the, franklin, school, in, washington, d, c, to, bell, at, the, window, of, his, laboratory, some, 700, feet, 213, m, away, 19, years, before, the, first, voice, radio, transmissions, bell, believed, the, photophone, s, principles, were, his, life, s, greatest, achievement, telling, a, reporter, shortly, before, his, death, that, the, photophone, was, the, greatest, invention, ever, made, greater, than, the, telephone, the, photophone, was, a, precursor, to, the, fiber, optic, communication, systems, which, achieved, popular, worldwide, usage, in, the, 1980s, its, master, patent, was, issued, in, december, 1880, many, decades, before, the, photophone, s, principles, came, into, popular, use, bell, is, also, credited, with, developing, one, of, the, early, versions, of, a, metal, detector, through, the, use, of, an, induction, balance, after, the, shooting, of, u, s, president, james, a, garfield, in, 1881, according, to, some, accounts, the, metal, detector, worked, flawlessly, in, tests, but, did, not, find, guiteau, s, bullet, partly, because, the, metal, bed, frame, on, which, the, president, was, lying, disturbed, the, instrument, resulting, in, static, garfield, s, surgeons, led, by, self, appointed, chief, physician, doctor, willard, bliss, were, skeptical, of, the, device, and, ignored, bell, s, requests, to, move, the, president, to, a, bed, not, fitted, with, metal, springs, alternatively, although, bell, had, detected, a, slight, sound, on, his, first, test, the, bullet, may, have, been, lodged, too, deeply, to, be, detected, by, the, crude, apparatus, bell, s, own, detailed, account, presented, to, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, 1882, differs, in, several, particulars, from, most, of, the, many, and, varied, versions, now, in, circulation, by, concluding, that, extraneous, metal, was, not, to, blame, for, failure, to, locate, the, bullet, perplexed, by, the, peculiar, results, he, had, obtained, during, an, examination, of, garfield, bell, proceeded, to, the, executive, mansion, the, next, morning, to, ascertain, from, the, surgeons, whether, they, were, perfectly, sure, that, all, metal, had, been, removed, from, the, neighborhood, of, the, bed, it, was, then, recollected, that, underneath, the, horse, hair, mattress, on, which, the, president, lay, was, another, mattress, composed, of, steel, wires, upon, obtaining, a, duplicate, the, mattress, was, found, to, consist, of, a, sort, of, net, of, woven, steel, wires, with, large, meshes, the, extent, of, the, having, been, so, small, as, compared, with, the, area, of, the, bed, it, seemed, reasonable, to, conclude, that, the, steel, mattress, had, produced, no, detrimental, effect, in, a, footnote, bell, adds, the, death, of, president, garfield, and, the, subsequent, post, mortem, examination, however, proved, that, the, bullet, was, at, too, great, a, distance, from, the, surface, to, have, affected, our, apparatus, the, march, 1906, scientific, american, article, by, american, pioneer, william, e, meacham, explained, the, basic, principle, of, hydrofoils, and, hydroplanes, bell, considered, the, invention, of, the, hydroplane, as, a, very, significant, achievement, based, on, information, gained, from, that, article, he, began, to, sketch, concepts, of, what, is, now, called, a, hydrofoil, boat, bell, and, assistant, frederick, w, casey, baldwin, began, hydrofoil, experimentation, in, the, summer, of, 1908, as, a, possible, aid, to, airplane, takeoff, from, water, baldwin, studied, the, work, of, the, italian, inventor, enrico, forlanini, and, began, testing, models, this, led, him, and, bell, to, the, development, of, practical, hydrofoil, watercraft, during, his, world, tour, of, 1910, 11, bell, and, baldwin, met, with, forlanini, in, france, they, had, rides, in, the, forlanini, hydrofoil, boat, over, lake, maggiore, baldwin, described, it, as, being, as, smooth, as, flying, on, returning, to, baddeck, a, number, of, initial, concepts, were, built, as, experimental, models, including, the, dhonnas, beag, scottish, gaelic, for, little, devil, the, first, self, propelled, bell, baldwin, hydrofoil, the, experimental, boats, were, essentially, proof, of, concept, prototypes, that, culminated, in, the, more, substantial, hd, 4, powered, by, renault, engines, a, top, speed, of, 54, miles, per, hour, 87, km, h, was, achieved, with, the, hydrofoil, exhibiting, rapid, acceleration, good, stability, and, steering, along, with, the, ability, to, take, waves, without, difficulty, in, 1913, dr, bell, hired, walter, pinaud, a, sydney, yacht, designer, and, builder, as, well, as, the, proprietor, of, pinaud, s, yacht, yard, in, westmount, nova, scotia, to, work, on, the, pontoons, of, the, hd, 4, pinaud, soon, took, over, the, boatyard, at, bell, laboratories, on, beinn, bhreagh, bell, s, estate, near, baddeck, nova, scotia, pinaud, s, experience, in, boatbuilding, enabled, him, to, make, useful, design, changes, to, the, hd, 4, after, the, first, world, war, work, began, again, on, the, hd, 4, bell, s, report, to, the, u, s, navy, permitted, him, to, obtain, two, 350, horsepower, 260, kilowatt, engines, in, july, 1919, on, september, 9, 1919, the, hd, 4, set, a, world, marine, speed, record, of, 70, 86, miles, per, hour, 114, 04, kilometres, per, hour, a, record, which, stood, for, ten, years, in, 1891, bell, had, begun, experiments, to, develop, motor, powered, heavier, than, air, aircraft, the, aea, was, first, formed, as, bell, shared, the, vision, to, fly, with, his, wife, who, advised, him, to, seek, young, help, as, bell, was, at, the, age, of, 60, in, 1898, bell, experimented, with, tetrahedral, box, kites, and, wings, constructed, of, multiple, compound, tetrahedral, kites, covered, in, maroon, silk, the, tetrahedral, wings, were, named, cygnet, i, ii, and, iii, and, were, flown, both, unmanned, and, manned, cygnet, i, crashed, during, a, flight, carrying, selfridge, in, the, period, from, 1907, to, 1912, some, of, bell, s, kites, are, on, display, at, the, alexander, graham, bell, national, historic, site, bell, was, a, supporter, of, aerospace, engineering, research, through, the, aerial, experiment, association, aea, officially, formed, at, baddeck, nova, scotia, in, october, 1907, at, the, suggestion, of, his, wife, mabel, and, with, her, financial, support, after, the, sale, of, some, of, her, real, estate, the, aea, was, headed, by, bell, and, the, founding, members, were, four, young, men, american, glenn, h, curtiss, a, motorcycle, manufacturer, at, the, time, and, who, held, the, title, world, s, fastest, man, having, ridden, his, self, constructed, motor, bicycle, around, in, the, shortest, time, and, who, was, later, awarded, the, scientific, american, trophy, for, the, first, official, one, kilometre, flight, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, who, later, became, a, world, renowned, airplane, manufacturer, lieutenant, thomas, selfridge, an, official, observer, from, the, u, s, federal, government, and, one, of, the, few, people, in, the, army, who, believed, that, aviation, was, the, future, frederick, w, baldwin, the, first, canadian, and, first, british, subject, to, pilot, a, public, flight, in, hammondsport, new, york, and, j, a, d, mccurdy, baldwin, and, mccurdy, being, new, engineering, graduates, from, the, university, of, toronto, the, aea, s, work, progressed, to, heavier, than, air, machines, applying, their, knowledge, of, kites, to, gliders, moving, to, hammondsport, the, group, then, designed, and, built, the, red, wing, framed, in, bamboo, and, covered, in, red, silk, and, powered, by, a, small, air, cooled, engine, on, march, 12, 1908, over, keuka, lake, the, biplane, lifted, off, on, the, first, public, flight, in, north, america, the, innovations, that, were, incorporated, into, this, design, included, a, cockpit, enclosure, and, tail, rudder, later, variations, on, the, original, design, would, add, ailerons, as, a, means, of, control, one, of, the, aea, s, inventions, a, practical, wingtip, form, of, the, aileron, was, to, become, a, standard, component, on, all, aircraft, the, white, wing, and, june, bug, were, to, follow, and, by, the, end, of, 1908, over, 150, flights, without, mishap, had, been, accomplished, however, the, aea, had, depleted, its, initial, reserves, and, only, a, 15, 000, grant, from, mrs, bell, allowed, it, to, continue, with, experiments, lt, selfridge, had, also, become, the, first, person, killed, in, a, powered, heavier, than, air, flight, in, a, crash, of, the, wright, flyer, at, fort, myer, virginia, on, september, 17, 1908, their, final, aircraft, design, the, silver, dart, embodied, all, of, the, advancements, found, in, the, earlier, machines, on, february, 23, 1909, bell, was, present, as, the, silver, dart, flown, by, j, a, d, mccurdy, from, the, frozen, ice, of, bras, d, or, made, the, first, aircraft, flight, in, canada, bell, had, worried, that, the, flight, was, too, dangerous, and, had, arranged, for, a, doctor, to, be, on, hand, with, the, successful, flight, the, aea, disbanded, and, the, silver, dart, would, revert, to, baldwin, and, mccurdy, who, began, the, canadian, aerodrome, company, and, would, later, demonstrate, the, aircraft, to, the, canadian, army, bell, along, with, many, members, of, the, scientific, community, at, the, time, took, an, interest, in, the, popular, science, of, heredity, which, grew, out, of, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, book, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, on, his, estate, in, nova, scotia, bell, conducted, meticulously, recorded, breeding, experiments, with, rams, and, ewes, over, the, course, of, more, than, 30, years, bell, sought, to, produce, a, breed, of, sheep, with, multiple, nipples, that, would, bear, twins, he, specifically, wanted, to, see, if, selective, breeding, could, produce, sheep, with, four, functional, nipples, with, enough, milk, for, twin, lambs, this, interest, in, animal, breeding, caught, the, attention, of, scientists, focused, on, the, study, of, heredity, and, genetics, in, humans, in, november, 1883, bell, presented, a, paper, at, a, meeting, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, titled, upon, the, formation, of, a, deaf, variety, of, the, human, race, the, paper, is, a, compilation, of, data, on, the, hereditary, aspects, of, deafness, bell, s, research, indicated, that, a, hereditary, tendency, toward, deafness, as, indicated, by, the, possession, of, deaf, relatives, was, an, important, element, in, determining, the, production, of, deaf, offspring, he, noted, that, the, proportion, of, deaf, children, born, to, deaf, parents, was, many, times, greater, than, the, proportion, of, deaf, children, born, to, the, general, population, in, the, paper, bell, delved, into, social, commentary, and, discussed, hypothetical, public, policies, to, bring, an, end, to, deafness, he, also, criticized, educational, practices, that, segregated, deaf, children, rather, than, integrated, them, fulling, into, mainstream, classrooms, the, paper, did, not, propose, sterilization, of, deaf, people, or, prohibition, on, intermarriage, noting, that, we, cannot, dictate, to, men, and, women, whom, they, should, marry, and, natural, selection, no, longer, influences, mankind, to, any, great, extent, a, review, of, bell, s, memoir, upon, the, formation, of, a, deaf, variety, of, the, human, race, appearing, in, an, 1885, issue, of, the, american, annals, of, the, deaf, and, dumb, states, that, dr, bell, does, not, advocate, legislative, interference, with, the, marriages, of, the, deaf, for, several, reasons, one, of, which, is, that, the, results, of, such, marriages, have, not, yet, been, sufficiently, investigated, the, article, goes, on, to, say, that, the, editorial, remarks, based, thereon, did, injustice, to, the, author, the, paper, s, author, concludes, by, saying, a, wiser, way, to, prevent, the, extension, of, hereditary, deafness, it, seems, to, us, would, be, to, continue, the, investigations, which, dr, bell, has, so, admirable, begun, until, the, laws, of, the, transmission, of, the, tendency, to, deafness, are, fully, understood, and, then, by, explaining, those, laws, to, the, pupils, of, our, schools, to, lead, them, to, choose, their, partners, in, marriage, in, such, a, way, that, deaf, mute, offspring, will, not, be, the, result, historians, have, noted, that, bell, explicitly, opposed, laws, regulating, marriage, and, never, mentioned, sterilization, in, any, of, his, writings, even, after, bell, agreed, to, engage, with, scientists, conducting, eugenic, research, he, consistently, refused, to, support, public, policy, that, limited, the, rights, or, privileges, of, the, deaf, bell, s, interest, and, research, on, heredity, attracted, the, interest, of, charles, davenport, a, harvard, professor, and, head, of, the, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, in, 1906, davenport, who, was, also, the, founder, of, the, american, breeder, s, association, approached, bell, about, joining, a, new, committee, on, eugenics, chaired, by, david, starr, jordan, in, 1910, davenport, opened, the, eugenics, records, office, at, cold, spring, harbor, to, give, the, organization, scientific, credibility, davenport, set, up, a, board, of, scientific, directors, naming, bell, as, chairman, other, members, of, the, board, included, luther, burbank, roswell, h, johnson, vernon, l, kellogg, and, william, e, castle, in, 1921, a, second, international, congress, of, eugenics, was, held, in, new, york, at, the, museum, of, natural, history, and, chaired, by, davenport, although, bell, did, not, present, any, research, or, speak, as, part, of, the, proceedings, he, was, named, as, honorary, president, as, a, means, to, attract, other, scientists, to, attend, the, event, a, summary, of, the, event, notes, that, bell, was, a, pioneering, investigator, in, the, field, of, human, heredity, bell, died, of, complications, arising, from, diabetes, on, august, 2, 1922, at, his, private, estate, in, cape, breton, nova, scotia, at, age, 75, bell, had, also, been, affected, by, pernicious, anemia, his, last, view, of, the, land, he, had, inhabited, was, by, moonlight, on, his, mountain, estate, at, 2, 00, a, m, while, tending, to, him, after, his, long, illness, mabel, his, wife, whispered, don, t, leave, me, by, way, of, reply, bell, signed, no, lost, consciousness, and, died, shortly, after, on, learning, of, bell, s, death, the, canadian, prime, minister, mackenzie, king, cabled, mrs, bell, saying, my, colleagues, in, the, government, join, with, me, in, expressing, to, you, our, sense, of, the, world, s, loss, in, the, death, of, your, distinguished, husband, it, will, ever, be, a, source, of, pride, to, our, country, that, the, great, invention, with, which, his, name, is, immortally, associated, is, a, part, of, its, history, on, the, behalf, of, the, citizens, of, canada, may, i, extend, to, you, an, expression, of, our, combined, gratitude, and, sympathy, bell, s, coffin, was, constructed, of, beinn, bhreagh, pine, by, his, laboratory, staff, lined, with, the, same, red, silk, fabric, used, in, his, tetrahedral, kite, experiments, to, help, celebrate, his, life, his, wife, asked, guests, not, to, wear, black, the, traditional, funeral, color, while, attending, his, service, during, which, soloist, jean, macdonald, sang, a, verse, of, robert, louis, stevenson, s, requiem, under, a, wide, and, starry, sky, dig, the, grave, and, let, me, lie, glad, did, i, live, and, gladly, die, and, i, laid, me, down, with, a, will, upon, the, conclusion, of, bell, s, funeral, for, one, minute, at, 6, 25, p, m, eastern, time, every, phone, on, the, continent, of, north, america, was, silenced, in, honor, of, the, man, who, had, given, to, mankind, the, means, for, direct, communication, at, a, distance, alexander, graham, bell, was, buried, atop, beinn, bhreagh, mountain, on, his, estate, where, he, had, resided, increasingly, for, the, last, 35, years, of, his, life, overlooking, bras, d, or, lake, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, mabel, his, two, daughters, elsie, may, and, marian, and, nine, of, his, grandchildren, honors, and, tributes, flowed, to, bell, in, increasing, numbers, as, his, invention, became, ubiquitous, and, his, personal, fame, grew, bell, received, numerous, honorary, degrees, from, colleges, and, universities, to, the, point, that, the, requests, almost, became, burdensome, during, his, life, he, also, received, dozens, of, major, awards, medals, and, other, tributes, these, included, statuary, monuments, to, both, him, and, the, new, form, of, communication, his, telephone, created, including, the, bell, telephone, memorial, erected, in, his, honor, in, alexander, graham, bell, gardens, in, brantford, ontario, in, 1917, a, large, number, of, bell, s, writings, personal, correspondence, notebooks, papers, and, other, documents, reside, in, both, the, united, states, library, of, congress, manuscript, division, as, the, alexander, graham, bell, family, papers, and, at, the, alexander, graham, bell, institute, cape, breton, university, nova, scotia, major, portions, of, which, are, available, for, online, viewing, a, number, of, historic, sites, and, other, marks, commemorate, bell, in, north, america, and, europe, including, the, first, telephone, companies, in, the, united, states, and, canada, among, the, major, sites, are, in, 1880, bell, received, the, volta, prize, with, a, purse, of, 50, 000, french, francs, approximately, us, 330, 000, in, today, s, dollars, for, the, invention, of, the, telephone, from, the, french, government, among, the, luminaries, who, judged, were, victor, hugo, and, alexandre, dumas, fils, the, volta, prize, was, conceived, by, napoleon, iii, in, 1852, and, named, in, honor, of, alessandro, volta, with, bell, becoming, the, second, recipient, of, the, grand, prize, in, its, history, since, bell, was, becoming, increasingly, affluent, he, used, his, prize, money, to, create, endowment, funds, the, volta, fund, and, institutions, in, and, around, the, united, states, capital, of, washington, d, c, these, included, the, prestigious, volta, laboratory, association, 1880, also, known, as, the, volta, laboratory, and, as, the, alexander, graham, bell, laboratory, and, which, eventually, led, to, the, volta, bureau, 1887, as, a, center, for, studies, on, deafness, which, is, still, in, operation, in, georgetown, washington, d, c, the, volta, laboratory, became, an, experimental, facility, devoted, to, scientific, discovery, and, the, very, next, year, it, improved, edison, s, phonograph, by, substituting, wax, for, tinfoil, as, the, recording, medium, and, incising, the, recording, rather, than, indenting, it, key, upgrades, that, edison, himself, later, adopted, the, laboratory, was, also, the, site, where, he, and, his, associate, invented, his, proudest, achievement, the, photophone, the, optical, telephone, which, presaged, fibre, optical, telecommunications, while, the, volta, bureau, would, later, evolve, into, the, alexander, graham, bell, association, for, the, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, the, ag, bell, a, leading, center, for, the, research, and, pedagogy, of, deafness, in, partnership, with, gardiner, greene, hubbard, bell, helped, establish, the, publication, science, during, the, early, 1880s, in, 1898, bell, was, elected, as, the, second, president, of, the, national, geographic, society, serving, until, 1903, and, was, primarily, responsible, for, the,
