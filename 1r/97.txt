painter, to, the, spanish, crown, in, 1786, and, this, early, portion, of, his, career, is, marked, by, portraits, of, the, spanish, aristocracy, and, royalty, and, rococo, style, tapestry, cartoons, designed, for, the, royal, palace, although, goya, s, letters, and, writings, survive, little, is, known, about, his, thoughts, he, had, a, severe, and, undiagnosed, illness, in, 1793, that, left, him, deaf, after, which, his, work, became, progressively, darker, and, more, pessimistic, his, later, easel, and, mural, paintings, prints, and, drawings, appear, to, reflect, a, bleak, outlook, on, personal, social, and, political, levels, and, contrast, with, his, social, climbing, he, was, appointed, director, of, the, royal, academy, in, 1795, the, year, manuel, godoy, made, an, unfavorable, treaty, with, france, in, 1799, goya, became, primer, pintor, de, c, mara, prime, court, painter, the, highest, rank, for, a, spanish, court, painter, in, the, late, 1790s, commissioned, by, godoy,

also, influenced, by, vel, zquez, in, 1807, napoleon, led, the, french, army, into, the, peninsular, war, against, spain, goya, remained, in, madrid, during, the, war, which, seems, to, have, affected, him, deeply, although, he, did, not, speak, his, thoughts, in, public, they, can, be, inferred, from, his, disasters, of, war, series, of, prints, although, published, 35, years, after, his, death, and, his, 1814, paintings, the, second, of, may, 1808, and, the, third, of, may, 1808, other, works, from, his, mid, period, include, the, caprichos, and, los, disparates, etching, series, and, a, wide, variety, of, paintings, concerned, with, insanity, mental, asylums, witches, fantastical, creatures, and, religious, and, political, corruption, all, of, which, suggest, that, he, feared, for, both, his, country, s, fate, and, his, own, mental, and, physical, health, his, late, period, culminates, with, the, black, paintings, of, 1819, 1823, applied, on, oil, on, the, plaster, walls, of, his, house, the, quinta, del, sordo, house, of, the, deaf, man, where, disillusioned, by, political, and, social, developments, in, spain, he, lived, in, near, isolation, goya, eventually, abandoned, spain, in, 1824, to, retire, to, the, french, city, of, bordeaux, accompanied, by, his, much, younger, maid, and, companion, leocadia, weiss, who, may, have, been, his, lover, there, he, completed, his, la, tauromaquia, series, and, a, number, of, other, works, following, a, stroke, that, left, him, paralyzed, on, his, right, side, goya, died, and, was, buried, on, 16, april, 1828, aged, 82, francisco, de, goya, was, born, in, fuendetodos, arag, n, spain, on, 30, march, 1746, to, jos, benito, de, goya, y, franque, and, gracia, de, lucientes, y, salvador, the, family, had, moved, that, year, from, the, city, of, zaragoza, but, there, is, no, record, why, likely, jos, was, commissioned, to, work, there, they, were, lower, middle, class, jos, was, the, son, of, a, notary, and, of, basque, origin, his, ancestors, being, from, zerain, earning, his, living, as, a, gilder, specialising, in, religious, and, decorative, craftwork, he, oversaw, the, gilding, and, most, of, the, ornamentation, during, the, rebuilding, of, the, basilica, of, our, lady, of, the, pillar, santa, maria, del, pilar, the, principal, cathedral, of, zaragoza, francisco, was, their, fourth, child, following, his, sister, rita, b, 1737, brother, tom, s, b, 1739, who, was, to, follow, in, his, father, s, trade, and, second, sister, jacinta, b, 1743, there, were, two, younger, sons, mariano, b, 1750, and, camilo, b, 1753, his, mother, s, family, had, pretensions, of, nobility, and, the, house, a, modest, brick, cottage, was, owned, by, her, family, and, perhaps, fancifully, bore, their, crest, about, 1749, jos, and, gracia, bought, a, home, in, zaragoza, and, were, able, to, return, to, live, in, the, city, although, there, are, no, surviving, records, it, is, thought, that, goya, may, have, attended, the, escuelas, p, as, de, san, ant, n, which, offered, free, schooling, his, education, seems, to, have, been, adequate, but, not, enlightening, he, had, reading, writing, and, numeracy, and, some, knowledge, of, the, classics, according, to, robert, hughes, the, artist, seems, to, have, taken, no, more, interest, than, a, carpenter, in, philosophical, or, theological, matters, and, his, views, on, painting, were, very, down, to, earth, goya, was, no, theoretician, at, school, he, formed, a, close, and, lifelong, friendship, with, fellow, pupil, mart, n, zapater, the, 131, letters, goya, wrote, to, him, from, 1775, until, zapater, s, death, in, 1803, give, valuable, insight, into, goya, s, early, years, at, the, court, in, madrid, at, age, 14, goya, studied, under, the, painter, jos, luz, n, where, he, copied, stamps, for, 4, years, until, he, decided, to, work, on, his, own, as, he, wrote, later, on, paint, from, my, invention, he, moved, to, madrid, to, study, with, anton, raphael, mengs, a, popular, painter, with, spanish, royalty, he, clashed, with, his, master, and, his, examinations, were, unsatisfactory, goya, submitted, entries, for, the, real, academia, de, bellas, artes, de, san, fernando, in, 1763, and, 1766, but, was, denied, entrance, into, the, academia, rome, was, then, the, cultural, capital, of, europe, and, held, all, the, prototypes, of, classical, antiquity, while, spain, lacked, a, coherent, artistic, direction, with, all, of, its, significant, visual, achievements, in, the, past, having, failed, to, earn, a, scholarship, goya, relocated, at, his, own, expense, to, rome, in, the, old, tradition, of, european, artists, stretching, back, at, least, to, albrecht, d, rer, he, was, an, unknown, at, the, time, and, so, the, records, are, scant, and, uncertain, early, biographers, have, him, travelling, to, rome, with, a, gang, of, bullfighters, where, he, worked, as, a, street, acrobat, or, for, a, russian, diplomat, or, fell, in, love, with, a, beautiful, young, nun, whom, he, plotted, to, abduct, from, her, convent, it, is, possible, that, goya, completed, two, surviving, mythological, paintings, during, the, visit, a, sacrifice, to, vesta, and, a, sacrifice, to, pan, both, dated, 1771, in, 1771, he, won, second, prize, in, a, painting, competition, organized, by, the, city, of, parma, that, year, he, returned, to, zaragoza, and, painted, elements, of, the, cupolas, of, the, basilica, of, the, pillar, including, adoration, of, the, name, of, god, a, cycle, of, frescoes, for, the, monastic, church, of, the, charterhouse, of, aula, dei, and, the, frescoes, of, the, sobradiel, palace, he, studied, with, the, aragonese, artist, francisco, bayeu, y, sub, as, and, his, painting, began, to, show, signs, of, the, delicate, tonalities, for, which, he, became, famous, he, befriended, francisco, bayeu, and, married, his, sister, josefa, he, nicknamed, her, pepa, on, 25, july, 1773, their, first, child, antonio, juan, ramon, carlos, was, born, on, 29, august, 1774, of, their, seven, children, only, one, a, son, named, javier, survived, into, adulthood, francisco, bayeu, josefa, bayeu, s, brother, 1765, membership, of, the, real, academia, de, bellas, artes, de, san, fernando, and, directorship, of, the, tapestry, works, from, 1777, helped, goya, earn, a, commission, for, a, series, of, tapestry, cartoons, for, the, royal, tapestry, factory, over, five, years, he, designed, some, 42, patterns, many, of, which, were, used, to, decorate, and, insulate, the, stone, walls, of, el, escorial, and, the, palacio, real, del, pardo, the, residences, of, the, spanish, monarchs, while, designing, tapestries, was, neither, prestigious, nor, well, paid, his, cartoons, are, mostly, popularist, in, a, rococo, style, and, goya, used, them, to, bring, himself, to, wider, attention, the, cartoons, were, not, his, only, royal, commissions, and, were, accompanied, by, a, series, of, engravings, mostly, copies, after, old, masters, such, as, marcantonio, raimondi, and, vel, zquez, goya, had, a, complicated, relationship, to, the, latter, artist, while, many, of, his, contemporaries, saw, folly, in, goya, s, attempts, to, copy, and, emulate, him, he, had, access, to, a, wide, range, of, the, long, dead, painter, s, works, that, had, been, contained, in, the, royal, collection, nonetheless, etching, was, a, medium, that, the, young, artist, was, to, master, a, medium, that, was, to, reveal, both, the, true, depths, of, his, imagination, and, his, political, beliefs, his, c, 1779, etching, of, the, garrotted, man, el, agarrotado, was, the, largest, work, he, had, produced, to, date, and, an, obvious, foreboding, of, his, later, disasters, of, war, series, goya, was, beset, by, illness, and, his, condition, was, used, against, him, by, his, rivals, who, looked, jealously, upon, any, artist, seen, to, be, rising, in, stature, some, of, the, larger, cartoons, such, as, the, wedding, were, more, than, 8, by, 10, feet, and, had, proved, a, drain, on, his, physical, strength, ever, resourceful, goya, turned, this, misfortune, around, claiming, that, his, illness, had, allowed, him, the, insight, to, produce, works, that, were, more, personal, and, informal, however, he, found, the, format, limiting, as, it, did, not, allow, him, to, capture, complex, color, shifts, or, texture, and, was, unsuited, to, the, impasto, and, glazing, techniques, he, was, by, then, applying, to, his, painted, works, the, tapestries, seem, as, comments, on, human, types, fashion, and, fads, other, works, from, the, period, include, a, canvas, for, the, altar, of, the, church, of, san, francisco, el, grande, in, madrid, which, led, to, his, appointment, as, a, member, of, the, royal, academy, of, fine, art, in, 1783, the, count, of, floridablanca, favorite, of, king, charles, iii, commissioned, goya, to, paint, his, portrait, he, became, friends, with, the, king, s, half, brother, luis, and, spent, two, summers, working, on, portraits, of, both, the, infante, and, his, family, during, the, 1780s, his, circle, of, patrons, grew, to, include, the, duke, and, duchess, of, osuna, the, king, and, other, notable, people, of, the, kingdom, whom, he, painted, in, 1786, goya, was, given, a, salaried, position, as, painter, to, charles, iii, goya, was, appointed, court, painter, to, charles, iv, in, 1789, the, following, year, he, became, first, court, painter, with, a, salary, of, 50, 000, reales, and, an, allowance, of, 500, ducats, for, a, coach, he, painted, portraits, of, the, king, and, the, queen, and, the, spanish, prime, minister, manuel, de, godoy, and, many, other, nobles, these, portraits, are, notable, for, their, disinclination, to, flatter, his, charles, iv, of, spain, and, his, family, is, an, especially, brutal, assessment, of, a, royal, family, modern, interpreters, view, the, portrait, as, satirical, it, is, thought, to, reveal, the, corruption, behind, the, rule, of, charles, iv, under, his, reign, his, wife, louisa, was, thought, to, have, had, the, real, power, and, thus, goya, placed, her, at, the, center, of, the, group, portrait, from, the, back, left, of, the, painting, one, can, see, the, artist, himself, looking, out, at, the, viewer, and, the, painting, behind, the, family, depicts, lot, and, his, daughters, thus, once, again, echoing, the, underlying, message, of, corruption, and, decay, goya, earned, commissions, from, the, highest, ranks, of, the, spanish, nobility, including, pedro, t, llez, gir, n, 9th, duke, of, osuna, and, his, wife, mar, a, josefa, pimentel, 12th, countess, duchess, of, benavente, jos, lvarez, de, toledo, duke, of, alba, and, his, wife, mar, a, del, pilar, de, silva, and, mar, a, ana, de, pontejos, y, sandoval, marchioness, of, pontejos, in, 1801, he, painted, godoy, in, a, commission, to, commemorate, the, victory, in, the, brief, war, of, the, oranges, against, portugal, the, two, were, friends, even, if, goya, s, 1801, portrait, is, usually, seen, as, satire, yet, even, after, godoy, s, fall, from, grace, the, politician, referred, to, the, artist, in, warm, terms, godoy, saw, himself, as, instrumental, in, the, publication, of, the, caprichos, and, is, widely, believed, to, have, commissioned, la, maja, desnuda, la, maja, desnuda, la, maja, desnuda, has, been, described, as, the, first, totally, profane, life, size, female, nude, in, western, art, without, pretense, to, allegorical, or, mythological, meaning, the, identity, of, the, majas, is, uncertain, the, most, popularly, cited, models, are, the, duchess, of, alba, with, whom, goya, was, sometimes, thought, to, have, had, an, affair, and, pepita, tud, mistress, of, manuel, de, godoy, neither, theory, has, been, verified, and, it, remains, as, likely, that, the, paintings, represent, an, idealized, composite, the, paintings, were, never, publicly, exhibited, during, goya, s, lifetime, and, were, owned, by, godoy, in, 1808, all, godoy, s, property, was, seized, by, ferdinand, vii, after, his, fall, from, power, and, exile, and, in, 1813, the, inquisition, confiscated, both, works, as, obscene, returning, them, in, 1836, to, the, academy, of, fine, arts, of, san, fernando, in, 1798, he, painted, luminous, and, airy, scenes, for, the, pendentives, and, cupola, of, the, real, ermita, chapel, of, san, antonio, de, la, florida, in, madrid, his, depiction, of, a, miracle, of, saint, anthony, of, padua, is, devoid, of, the, customary, angels, and, instead, treats, the, miracle, as, if, it, were, a, theatrical, event, performed, by, ordinary, people, at, some, time, between, late, 1792, and, early, 1793, an, undiagnosed, illness, left, goya, deaf, he, became, withdrawn, and, introspective, while, the, direction, and, tone, of, his, work, changed, he, began, the, series, of, aquatinted, etchings, published, in, 1799, as, the, caprichos, completed, in, parallel, with, the, more, official, commissions, of, portraits, and, religious, paintings, in, 1799, goya, published, 80, caprichos, prints, depicting, what, he, described, as, the, innumerable, foibles, and, follies, to, be, found, in, any, civilized, society, and, from, the, common, prejudices, and, deceitful, practices, which, custom, ignorance, or, self, interest, have, made, usual, the, visions, in, these, prints, are, partly, explained, by, the, caption, the, sleep, of, reason, produces, monsters, yet, these, are, not, solely, bleak, they, demonstrate, the, artist, s, sharp, satirical, wit, as, in, capricho, number, 52, what, a, tailor, can, do, while, convalescing, between, 1793, and, 1794, goya, completed, a, set, of, eleven, small, pictures, painted, on, tin, that, marked, a, significant, change, in, the, tone, and, subject, matter, of, his, art, and, drew, from, the, dark, and, dramatic, realms, of, fantasy, nightmare, yard, with, lunatics, is, a, vision, of, loneliness, fear, and, social, alienation, the, condemnation, of, brutality, towards, prisoners, whether, criminal, or, insane, is, a, subject, that, goya, assayed, in, later, works, that, focused, on, the, degradation, of, the, human, figure, it, was, one, of, the, first, of, goya, s, mid, 1790s, cabinet, paintings, in, which, his, earlier, search, for, ideal, beauty, gave, way, to, an, examination, of, the, relationship, between, naturalism, and, fantasy, that, would, preoccupy, him, for, the, rest, of, his, career, he, was, undergoing, a, nervous, breakdown, and, entering, prolonged, physical, illness, and, admitted, that, the, series, was, created, to, reflect, his, own, self, doubt, anxiety, and, fear, that, he, was, losing, his, mind, goya, wrote, that, the, works, served, to, occupy, my, imagination, tormented, as, it, is, by, contemplation, of, my, sufferings, the, series, he, said, consisted, of, pictures, which, normally, find, no, place, in, commissioned, works, goya, s, physical, and, mental, breakdown, seems, to, have, happened, a, few, weeks, after, the, french, declaration, of, war, on, spain, a, contemporary, reported, the, noises, in, his, head, and, deafness, aren, t, improving, yet, his, vision, is, much, better, and, he, is, back, in, control, of, his, balance, these, symptoms, may, indicate, a, prolonged, viral, encephalitis, or, possibly, a, series, of, miniature, strokes, resulting, from, high, blood, pressure, and, which, affected, the, hearing, and, balance, centres, of, the, brain, symptoms, of, tinnitus, episodes, of, imbalance, and, progressive, deafness, are, typical, of, m, ni, re, s, disease, it, is, possible, that, goya, had, cumulative, lead, poisoning, as, he, used, massive, amounts, of, lead, white, which, he, ground, himself, in, his, paintings, both, as, a, canvas, primer, and, as, a, primary, colour, other, postmortem, diagnostic, assessments, include, susac, s, syndrome, or, may, point, toward, paranoid, dementia, possibly, due, to, brain, trauma, as, evidenced, by, marked, changes, in, his, work, after, his, recovery, culminating, in, the, black, paintings, art, historians, have, noted, goya, s, singular, ability, to, express, his, personal, demons, as, horrific, and, fantastic, imagery, that, speaks, universally, and, allows, his, audience, to, find, its, own, catharsis, in, the, images, the, french, army, invaded, spain, in, 1808, leading, to, the, peninsular, war, of, 1808, 1814, the, extent, of, goya, s, involvement, with, the, court, of, the, intruder, king, joseph, i, the, brother, of, napoleon, bonaparte, is, not, known, he, painted, works, for, french, patrons, and, sympathisers, but, kept, neutral, during, the, fighting, after, the, restoration, of, the, spanish, king, ferdinand, vii, in, 1814, goya, denied, any, involvement, with, the, french, by, the, time, of, his, wife, josefa, s, death, in, 1812, he, was, painting, the, second, of, may, 1808, and, the, third, of, may, 1808, and, preparing, the, series, of, etchings, later, known, as, the, disasters, of, war, los, desastres, de, la, guerra, ferdinand, vii, returned, to, spain, in, 1814, but, relations, with, goya, were, not, cordial, the, artist, completed, portraits, of, the, king, for, a, variety, of, ministries, but, not, for, the, king, himself, although, goya, did, not, make, his, intention, known, when, creating, the, disasters, of, war, art, historians, view, them, as, a, visual, protest, against, the, violence, of, the, 1808, dos, de, mayo, uprising, the, subsequent, peninsular, war, and, the, move, against, liberalism, in, the, aftermath, of, the, restoration, of, the, bourbon, monarchy, in, 1814, the, scenes, are, singularly, disturbing, sometimes, macabre, in, their, depiction, of, battlefield, horror, and, represent, an, outraged, conscience, in, the, face, of, death, and, destruction, they, were, not, published, until, 1863, 35, years, after, his, death, it, is, likely, that, only, then, was, it, considered, politically, safe, to, distribute, a, sequence, of, artworks, criticising, both, the, french, and, restored, bourbons, the, first, 47, plates, in, the, series, focus, on, incidents, from, the, war, and, show, the, consequences, of, the, conflict, on, individual, soldiers, and, civilians, the, middle, series, plates, 48, to, 64, record, the, effects, of, the, famine, that, hit, madrid, in, 1811, 12, before, the, city, was, liberated, from, the, french, the, final, 17, reflect, the, bitter, disappointment, of, liberals, when, the, restored, bourbon, monarchy, encouraged, by, the, catholic, hierarchy, rejected, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, and, opposed, both, state, and, religious, reform, since, their, first, publication, goya, s, scenes, of, atrocities, starvation, degradation, and, humiliation, have, been, described, as, the, prodigious, flowering, of, rage, his, works, from, 1814, to, 1819, are, mostly, commissioned, portraits, but, also, include, the, altarpiece, of, santa, justa, and, santa, rufina, for, the, cathedral, of, seville, the, print, series, of, la, tauromaquia, depicting, scenes, from, bullfighting, and, probably, the, etchings, of, los, disparates, records, of, goya, s, later, life, are, relatively, scant, and, ever, politically, aware, he, suppressed, a, number, of, his, works, from, this, period, working, instead, in, private, he, was, tormented, by, a, dread, of, old, age, and, fear, of, madness, goya, had, been, a, successful, and, royally, placed, artist, but, withdrew, from, public, life, during, his, final, years, from, the, late, 1810s, he, lived, in, near, solitude, outside, madrid, in, a, farmhouse, converted, into, a, studio, the, house, had, become, known, as, la, quinta, del, sordo, the, house, of, the, deaf, man, after, the, nearest, farmhouse, that, had, coincidentally, also, belonged, to, a, deaf, man, art, historians, assume, goya, felt, alienated, from, the, social, and, political, trends, that, followed, the, 1814, restoration, of, the, bourbon, monarchy, and, that, he, viewed, these, developments, as, reactionary, means, of, social, control, in, his, unpublished, art, he, seems, to, have, railed, against, what, he, saw, as, a, tactical, retreat, into, medievalism, it, is, thought, that, he, had, hoped, for, political, and, religious, reform, but, like, many, liberals, became, disillusioned, when, the, restored, bourbon, monarchy, and, catholic, hierarchy, rejected, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, at, the, age, of, 75, alone, and, in, mental, and, physical, despair, he, completed, the, work, of, his, 14, black, paintings, all, of, which, were, executed, in, oil, directly, onto, the, plaster, walls, of, his, house, goya, did, not, intend, for, the, paintings, to, be, exhibited, did, not, write, of, them, and, likely, never, spoke, of, them, around, 1874, 50, years, after, his, death, they, were, taken, down, and, transferred, to, a, canvas, support, by, owner, baron, fr, d, ric, mile, d, erlanger, many, of, the, works, were, significantly, altered, during, the, restoration, and, in, the, words, of, arthur, lubow, what, remain, are, at, best, a, crude, facsimile, of, what, goya, painted, the, effects, of, time, on, the, murals, coupled, with, the, inevitable, damage, caused, by, the, delicate, operation, of, mounting, the, crumbling, plaster, on, canvas, meant, that, most, of, the, murals, suffered, extensive, damage, and, loss, of, paint, today, they, are, on, permanent, display, at, the, museo, del, prado, madrid, leocadia, weiss, n, e, zorrilla, 1790, 1856, the, artist, s, maid, younger, by, 35, years, and, a, distant, relative, lived, with, and, cared, for, goya, after, bayeu, s, death, she, stayed, with, him, in, his, quinta, del, sordo, villa, until, 1824, with, her, daughter, rosario, leocadia, was, probably, similar, in, features, to, goya, s, first, wife, josefa, bayeu, to, the,
