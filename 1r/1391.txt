three, arrows, an, allusion, to, an, old, japanese, story, of, policy, the, first, arrow, was, monetary, expansion, aimed, at, achieving, a, 2, inflation, target, the, second, a, flexible, fiscal, policy, to, act, as, an, economic, stimulus, in, the, short, term, then, achieve, a, budget, surplus, and, the, third, a, growth, strategy, focusing, on, structural, reform, and, private, sector, investment, to, achieve, long, term, growth, in, 2019, it, was, reported, that, 40, of, key, economic, statistics, collected, from, 2005, to, 2017, contained, errors, casting, doubt, on, the, effectiveness, of, abe, s, economic, program, and, the, reliability, of, japanese, economic, statistics, it, was, discovered, that, the, labor, ministry, did, not, follow, protocol, by, only, surveying, about, one, third, of, all, the, large, japanese, businesses, it, was, supposed, to, survey, the, data, was, eventually, corrected, and, it, was, discovered, that, the, faulty, data, presented, japanese, economic, statistics, more, favorably, than, the, corrected, data, the, faulty, data, costed, 19, 7, million, people, about, 53, 7, billion, yen, in, unpaid, benefits, and, costed, the, japanese, government, 650, million, yen, to, correct, the, error, opposition, politicians, criticized, the, governments, response, one, lawmaker, called, abe, s, economic, program, a, fraud, with, many, journalists, labeling, the, event, as, a, data, scandal, at, the, first, cefp, meeting, in, january, 2013, abe, declared, that, the, bank, of, japan, should, follow, a, policy, of, monetary, easing, to, achieve, a, target, of, 2, percent, inflation, abe, maintained, pressure, on, the, bank, s, governor, masaaki, shirakawa, who, was, reluctant, to, set, specific, targets, into, agreeing, to, the, policy, in, february, after, abe, publicly, speculated, that, the, government, could, legislate, to, strip, the, bank, of, independence, shirakawa, announced, he, was, leaving, office, prematurely, before, his, term, expired, abe, then, appointed, haruhiko, kuroda, as, governor, who, had, previously, advocated, inflation, targets, and, who, has, pursued, the, government, s, policies, of, monetary, easing, after, the, first, meeting, of, the, bank, s, monetary, policy, committee, after, he, had, taken, office, in, april, kuroda, announced, an, aggressive, program, of, easing, intended, to, double, the, money, supply, and, achieve, the, 2, percent, inflation, target, at, the, earliest, possible, time, over, the, first, six, months, of, the, second, abe, cabinet, the, yen, fell, from, a, high, of, 77, to, the, dollar, to, 101, 8, and, the, nikkei, 225, rose, by, 70, percent, in, a, surprise, move, in, october, 2014, kuroda, announced, that, the, boj, would, boost, the, monetary, easing, program, and, accelerate, asset, purchases, the, monetary, policy, committee, split, by, five, votes, to, four, but, supported, the, policy, this, was, interpreted, as, a, response, to, disappointing, economic, figures, in, the, aftermath, of, the, increase, in, the, consumption, tax, to, 8, percent, inflation, has, fallen, to, 1, percent, from, its, peak, of, 1, 5, percent, in, april, the, abe, cabinet, s, first, budget, included, a, 10, 3, trillion, yen, stimulus, package, composed, of, public, works, spending, aid, for, small, businesses, and, investment, incentives, that, aimed, to, increase, growth, by, 2, percent, the, budget, also, increased, defense, spending, and, manpower, while, reducing, foreign, aid, in, autumn, 2013, abe, decided, to, proceed, with, the, first, stage, of, the, increase, in, the, consumption, tax, from, 5, to, 8, percent, in, april, 2014, with, a, second, stage, envisaged, raising, it, to, 10, percent, in, october, 2015, the, bill, to, raise, the, tax, had, been, passed, under, the, previous, dpj, government, but, the, final, decision, lay, with, the, prime, minister, he, and, finance, minister, tar, as, explained, that, the, tax, would, be, increased, to, provide, a, sustainable, basis, for, future, social, spending, and, to, avoid, the, need, to, finance, future, stimulus, by, issuing, government, bonds, while, this, was, expected, to, affect, economic, growth, in, the, quarter, following, the, rise, abe, also, announced, a, 5, trillion, yen, stimulus, package, that, aimed, to, mitigate, any, effects, on, economic, revival, after, the, increase, in, april, japan, fell, into, recession, during, the, second, and, third, quarters, of, 2014, leading, to, abe, delaying, the, second, stage, of, the, tax, rise, until, april, 2017, and, calling, a, snap, election, see, 2014, general, election, in, response, to, the, recession, aso, announced, that, the, government, would, ask, the, diet, to, pass, a, supplementary, budget, to, fund, a, further, stimulus, package, worth, 2, 3, trillion, yen, there, had, been, some, division, within, the, abe, cabinet, between, fiscal, hawks, such, as, finance, minister, aso, who, favored, fiscal, consolidation, through, spending, cuts, and, tax, increases, and, deflationists, such, as, abe, himself, who, argued, in, favor, of, a, growth, first, policy, that, prioritizes, economic, expansion, and, recovery, over, budget, considerations, using, the, slogan, no, fiscal, health, without, economic, revitalization, abe, s, decision, to, delay, the, consumption, tax, increase, in, november, 2014, and, his, push, for, a, large, fiscal, deficit, in, the, 2015, budget, without, social, security, cuts, was, interpreted, as, a, victory, for, this, faction, within, the, ldp, the, government, did, however, commit, to, a, primary, surplus, by, 2020, and, pledged, to, review, its, strategy, in, 2018, if, the, primary, deficit, had, not, fallen, to, 1, percent, of, gdp, by, that, time, on, 15, march, 2013, abe, announced, that, japan, was, entering, negotiations, to, join, the, trans, pacific, partnership, tpp, this, was, interpreted, by, analysts, as, a, means, through, which, the, government, could, enact, reforms, to, liberalize, certain, sectors, of, the, japanese, economy, most, notably, agriculture, and, was, criticized, by, farm, lobbies, and, some, sections, of, the, ldp, economist, yoshizaki, tatsuhiko, described, the, tpp, as, having, the, potential, to, act, as, the, linchpin, of, abe, s, economic, revitalization, strategy, by, making, japan, more, competitive, through, free, trade, in, february, 2015, the, abe, government, struck, a, deal, to, limit, the, power, of, the, ja, zenchu, body, to, supervise, and, audit, japan, s, agricultural, co, operatives, in, a, move, designed, to, facilitate, tpp, negotiations, improve, the, competitiveness, of, japan, s, farming, sector, and, curtail, the, influence, of, the, agriculture, lobby, abe, revealed, the, first, measures, related, to, the, third, arrow, policies, in, june, 2013, which, included, plans, to, establish, deregulated, economic, zones, and, allow, the, sale, of, drugs, online, but, did, not, include, substantial, measures, related, to, the, labor, market, or, business, reform, these, measures, were, less, well, received, than, the, first, two, arrows, had, been, since, abe, took, office, with, the, stock, market, falling, slightly, and, critics, arguing, that, they, lacked, detail, the, economist, for, example, judged, the, announcement, a, misfire, analysts, did, note, however, that, abe, was, waiting, until, after, the, july, upper, house, elections, to, reveal, further, details, to, avoid, an, adverse, reaction, by, voters, to, potentially, unpopular, reforms, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, world, economic, forum, wef, in, davos, in, 2014, abe, announced, that, he, was, ready, to, act, as, a, drill, bit, to, break, through, the, rock, of, vested, interests, and, red, tape, to, achieve, structural, reforms, of, the, economy, he, cited, reforms, in, agriculture, energy, and, health, sectors, as, evidence, of, this, and, pledged, to, push, forward, with, the, tpp, a, japan, eu, trade, deal, and, tax, corporate, governance, and, planning, reforms, abe, announced, a, package, of, structural, reforms, in, june, 2014, that, the, economist, described, as, less, a, single, arrow, than, a, 1, 000, strong, bundle, and, compared, favorably, to, the, 2013, announcement, these, new, measures, included, corporate, governance, reform, the, easing, of, restrictions, on, hiring, foreign, staff, in, special, economic, zones, liberalizing, the, health, sector, and, measures, to, help, foreign, and, local, entrepreneurs, the, plans, also, included, a, cut, in, corporation, tax, to, below, 30, percent, an, expansion, of, childcare, to, encourage, women, to, join, the, workforce, and, the, loosening, of, restrictions, on, overtime, in, december, 2015, the, government, announced, corporation, tax, would, be, reduced, to, 29, 97, percent, in, 2016, bringing, the, cut, forward, one, year, ahead, of, schedule, in, september, 2013, abe, called, for, a, society, in, which, all, women, can, shine, setting, a, target, that, 30, percent, of, leadership, positions, should, be, held, by, women, by, 2020, abe, cited, the, womenomics, ideas, of, kathy, matsui, that, greater, participation, by, women, in, the, workforce, which, is, relatively, low, in, japan, especially, in, leadership, roles, could, improve, japan, s, gdp, and, potentially, fertility, rates, despite, declining, population, figures, the, abe, cabinet, introduced, measures, to, expand, childcare, and, legislation, to, force, public, and, private, organizations, to, publish, data, on, the, number, of, women, they, employ, and, what, positions, they, hold, in, november, 2013, the, abe, cabinet, passed, a, bill, to, liberalize, japan, s, electricity, market, by, abolishing, price, controls, breaking, up, regional, monopolies, and, separating, power, transmission, from, generation, by, creating, a, national, grid, company, this, move, was, partly, in, response, to, the, 2011, fukushima, disaster, and, the, bill, faced, little, opposition, in, the, diet, by, march, 2015, more, than, 500, companies, had, applied, to, the, economy, ministry, to, enter, the, electricity, retail, market, and, the, electricity, industry, was, expected, to, be, fully, liberalized, by, 2016, with, gas, utilities, expected, to, follow, suit, by, 2017, abe, had, also, said, he, favored, the, re, building, of, japan, s, nuclear, reactors, following, the, fukushima, disaster, though, much, of, the, authority, to, restart, nuclear, plants, lies, with, local, governments, and, planned, to, strengthen, relations, with, the, united, states, in, 2013, the, eurekahedge, japan, hedge, fund, index, posted, a, record, 28, percent, return, which, was, credited, to, the, unprecedented, actions, of, the, abe, government, in, july, 2015, the, imf, reported, that, while, the, structural, reforms, had, modestly, improved, growth, prospects, further, high, impact, structural, reforms, are, needed, to, lift, growth, and, prevent, over, reliance, on, yen, depreciation, when, abe, returned, to, office, although, neither, party, had, controlled, the, house, of, councillors, the, upper, house, of, the, diet, since, the, 2007, election, the, opposition, dpj, was, the, largest, party, the, governing, coalition, enjoyed, a, two, thirds, majority, in, the, lower, house, allowing, it, to, override, the, upper, house, s, veto, but, this, requires, a, delay, of, 90, days, this, situation, known, as, the, twisted, diet, had, contributed, to, political, gridlock, and, the, revolving, door, of, prime, ministers, since, 2007, abe, s, campaign, for, the, 2013, election, focused, on, themes, of, economic, revival, asking, voters, to, give, him, a, stable, mandate, in, both, houses, to, pursue, reforms, and, took, a, more, moderate, tone, on, defense, and, constitutional, matters, in, the, 2013, upper, house, election, the, ldp, emerged, as, the, largest, party, with, 115, seats, a, gain, of, 31, and, the, komeito, with, 20, a, gain, of, 1, giving, abe, s, coalition, control, of, both, houses, of, the, diet, but, not, the, two, thirds, majority, in, the, upper, house, that, would, allow, for, constitutional, revision, with, no, national, elections, due, until, 2016, this, result, was, described, as, giving, abe, the, opportunity, of, three, golden, years, of, parliamentary, stability, in, which, to, implement, his, policies, abe, s, return, to, the, prime, ministership, saw, a, renewed, attempt, to, downplay, japan, s, wartime, atrocities, in, school, textbooks, an, issue, that, had, contributed, to, his, earlier, downfall, in, 2013, abe, supported, the, creation, of, the, top, global, university, project, program, this, is, a, ten, year, program, to, increase, international, student, attendance, in, japanese, universities, and, hire, more, foreign, faculty, there, is, also, funding, for, selected, universities, to, create, english, only, undergraduate, programs, in, 2014, abe, allocated, millions, of, dollars, of, the, fiscal, budget, to, help, programs, that, help, single, individuals, in, japan, find, potential, mates, these, programs, entitled, marriage, support, programs, were, started, in, hopes, of, raising, japan, s, declining, birthrate, which, was, half, of, what, it, was, six, decades, prior, shortly, after, taking, office, abe, signaled, a, drastic, reshaping, of, foreign, policy, and, promised, to, pursue, diplomacy, with, a, global, rather, than, a, regional, or, bilateral, outlook, based, on, the, fundamental, values, of, freedom, democracy, basic, human, rights, and, the, rule, of, law, his, choice, of, fumio, kishida, as, foreign, minister, was, interpreted, as, a, sign, that, he, would, pursue, a, more, moderate, line, compared, to, his, hawkish, stance, in, the, run, up, to, the, general, election, his, first, visit, overseas, after, becoming, prime, minister, once, again, was, to, various, countries, in, southeast, asia, abe, increased, its, allies, in, its, international, campaign, to, counter, a, north, korean, nuclear, threat, abe, often, visited, countries, such, as, singapore, japan, s, largest, asian, investor, and, vice, versa, within, weeks, of, returning, to, power, the, second, abe, cabinet, faced, the, in, amenas, hostage, crisis, of, 2013, in, which, 10, japanese, citizens, were, killed, abe, condemned, the, killings, as, absolutely, unforgivable, and, confirmed, that, japan, and, britain, had, co, operated, over, the, incident, abe, believed, that, this, incident, demonstrated, the, need, for, the, creation, of, a, japanese, national, security, council, see, below, and, convened, a, panel, to, consider, its, creation, soon, after, the, crisis, abe, was, unusually, active, in, the, field, of, foreign, affairs, for, a, japanese, prime, minister, making, visits, to, 49, countries, between, december, 2012, and, september, 2014, a, number, that, was, described, as, unprecedented, by, contrast, his, immediate, two, predecessors, naoto, kan, and, yoshihiko, noda, visited, a, combined, total, of, 18, countries, between, june, 2010, and, december, 2012, this, was, interpreted, as, a, means, to, offset, poor, relations, with, the, prc, and, the, koreas, by, increasing, japan, s, profile, on, the, world, stage, and, improving, bilateral, ties, with, other, countries, in, the, region, southeast, asian, nations, australia, and, india, were, significant, and, frequent, destinations, for, abe, who, visited, all, 10, asean, countries, in, his, first, year, in, office, the, diplomatic, tours, also, functioned, as, another, element, of, abenomics, by, promoting, japan, to, the, international, business, community, and, opening, up, avenues, for, trade, energy, and, defense, procurement, deals, for, example, business, executives, often, travel, with, abe, on, these, visits, in, september, 2013, abe, intervened, to, aid, tokyo, s, bid, to, host, the, 2020, summer, olympic, and, paralympic, games, giving, a, speech, in, english, at, the, ioc, session, in, buenos, aires, in, which, he, extolled, the, role, of, sport, in, japan, and, sought, to, reassure, the, committee, that, any, ongoing, issues, with, the, fukushima, plant, were, under, control, after, the, bid, was, successful, abe, sought, to, portray, the, games, as, symbolic, of, his, abenomics, economic, revitalization, programme, saying, i, want, to, make, the, olympics, a, trigger, for, sweeping, away, 15, years, of, deflation, and, economic, decline, in, 2014, he, said, that, he, hoped, a, robot, olympics, would, be, held, at, the, same, time, to, promote, the, robotics, industry, abe, s, foreign, policy, moved, japan, away, from, its, traditional, focus, on, the, big, three, bilateral, relationships, with, the, united, states, prc, and, south, korea, and, sought, to, increase, japan, s, international, profile, by, expanding, ties, with, nato, the, european, union, and, other, organizations, beyond, the, asia, pacific, region, in, 2014, abe, and, british, prime, minister, david, cameron, agreed, to, establish, a, 2, 2, framework, of, annual, consultations, between, the, british, and, japanese, foreign, and, defense, ministries, with, abe, calling, for, greater, co, operation, on, issues, from, peace, of, the, seas, to, the, security, of, the, skies, space, and, cyberspace, this, followed, a, similar, agreement, with, french, ministers, in, tokyo, earlier, in, the, year, in, fact, this, followed, the, herman, kahn, lecture, of, 25, september, 2013, in, which, he, outlined, his, foreign, policy, for, the, next, several, years, in, fact, he, was, the, first, non, american, to, receive, this, award, in, it, he, championed, the, indo, pacific, century, based, on, freedom, democracy, human, rights, and, the, rules, based, order, with, the, tpp, as, its, backbone, he, planned, at, this, time, to, reshape, the, interpretation, of, the, constitution, away, from, the, narrowness, that, would, see, the, jsdf, handcuffed, and, unable, to, help, allies, in, time, of, need, the, new, national, security, council, of, japan, was, born, in, this, speech, during, which, abe, observed, that, its, neighbour, had, increased, its, own, military, budget, by, at, least, 10, per, annum, for, more, than, 20, years, abe, stated, that, because, japan, was, one, of, the, most, mature, democracies, he, thought, it, only, natural, that, japan, help, ensure, the, welfare, and, security, of, the, world, and, found, it, right, that, his, beloved, country, a, proactive, contributor, to, peace, abe, concluded, the, japan, australia, economic, partnership, agreement, with, australia, s, abbott, government, in, 2014, and, addressed, a, joint, sitting, of, the, australian, parliament, in, july, in, heralding, the, agreement, he, also, offered, condolences, for, the, suffering, of, australians,

to, increase, co, operation, over, economic, defense, and, security, issues, and, signed, trade, agreements, related, to, energy, tourism, and, telecoms, a, close, relationship, was, anticipated, between, abe, and, narendra, modi, after, the, latter, s, election, as, prime, minister, of, india, in, may, 2014, when, it, was, noted, that, they, had, established, ties, from, at, least, seven, years, previously, when, modi, was, still, chief, minister, of, gujarat, and, that, modi, was, one, of, three, people, abe, followed, on, twitter, the, two, men, exchanged, congratulatory, messages, after, the, election, modi, made, his, first, major, foreign, visit, to, japan, in, autumn, of, 2014, where, during, the, visit, abe, invited, modi, to, become, the, first, indian, leader, to, stay,

told, officials, from, the, asean, countries, the, united, states, and, australia, that, japan, wanted, to, play, a, major, role, in, maintaining, regional, security, a, departure, from, the, passiveness, it, has, displayed, since, world, war, ii, he, offered, japan, s, support, to, other, countries, in, resolving, territorial, disputes, relations, between, japan, and, its, immediate, neighbors, the, prc, and, south, korea, remained, poor, after, abe, s, return, to, office, while, he, declared, that, the, doors, are, always, open, on, my, side, no, bilateral, meetings, between, abe, and, the, prc, leadership, took, place, for, the, first, 23, months, of, his, second, term, neither, did, abe, hold, any, meetings, with, president, park, geun, hye, of, south, korea, during, his, 2012, to, 2014, term, of, office, both, countries, criticized, abe, s, visit, to, the, yasukuni, shrine, in, december, 2013, with, the, prc, s, foreign, minister, describing, the, action, as, moving, japan, in, an, extremely, dangerous, direction, in, addition, the, prc, continued, to, criticize, abe, s, defense, reform, policies, warning, that, japan, should, not, abandon, its, post, war, policy, of, pacifism, abe, s, speech, at, the, wef, in, 2014, was, interpreted, as, a, criticism, of, prc, foreign, and, defense, policy, when, he, said, that, the, dividends, of, growth, in, asia, must, not, be, wasted, on, military, expansion, and, called, for, greater, preservation, of, the, freedom, of, the, seas, under, the, rule, of, law, although, he, did, not, specifically, refer, to, any, one, country, during, his, remarks, in, november, 2014, abe, met, prc, president, xi, jinping, at, the, apec, meeting, in, beijing, for, the, first, time, since, either, had, taken, office, after, a, photocall, that, was, described, as, awkward, by, the, press, abe, later, told, reporters, that, during, the, meeting, he, suggested, establishing, a, hotline, between, tokyo, and, beijing, to, help, resolve, any, maritime, clashes, and, that, the, first, step, had, been, taken, to, improve, relations, abe, tried, to, centralize, security, policy, in, the, prime, minister, s, office, by, creating, the, national, security, council, to, better, coordinate, national, security, policy, and, by, ordering, the, first, national, security, strategy, in, japan, s, history, based, upon, the, american, body, of, the, same, name, the, law, to, create, the, nsc, was, passed, in, november, 2013, and, began, operating, the, following, month, when, abe, appointed, shotaro, yachi, as, japan, s, first, national, security, advisor, in, december, 2013, abe, announced, a, five, year, plan, of, military, expansion, he, described, this, as, proactive, pacificism, with, the, goal, of, making, japan, a, more, normal, country, able, to, defend, itself, this, was, in, reaction, to, a, prc, buildup, and, a, decreased, american, influence, in, the, region, in, the, same, month, the, diet, passed, the, abe, cabinet, s, state, secrecy, law, which, took, effect, in, december, 2014, the, law, expanded, the, scope, for, the, government, to, designate, what, information, constitutes, a, state, secret, and, increased, penalties, for, bureaucrats, and, journalists, who, leak, such, information, to, up, to, 10, years, in, prison, and, a, 10, million, yen, fine, the, passage, of, the, law, proved, controversial, with, thousands, protesting, the, bill, in, tokyo, and, the, cabinet, s, approval, rating, falling, below, 50, percent, for, the, first, time, in, some, polls, detractors, argued, that, the, law, was, ambiguous, and, therefore, gave, the, government, too, much, freedom, to, decide, which, information, to, classify, that, it, could, curtail, freedom, of, the, press, and, that, the, cabinet, had, rushed, the, legislation, without, including, any, corresponding, freedom, of, information, guarantees, abe, argued, that, the, law, was, necessary, and, applied, only, in, cases, of, national, security, diplomacy, public, safety, and, counter, terrorism, saying, if, the, law, prevents, films, from, being, made, or, weakens, freedom, of, the, press, i, ll, resign, however, he, did, concede, that, in, retrospect, the, government, should, have, explained, the, details, of, the, bill, more, carefully, to, the, public, in, july, 2014, the, abe, cabinet, decided, to, re, interpret, japan, s, constitution, to, allow, for, the, right, of, collective, self, defense, this, would, allow, the, self, defense, forces, to, come, to, the, aid, of, and, defend, an, ally, under, attack, whereas, the, previous, interpretation, of, the, constitution, was, strictly, pacifist, and, allowed, for, the, force, to, be, used, only, in, absolute, self, defence, the, decision, was, supported, by, the, united, states, which, has, argued, for, greater, scope, for, action, by, japan, as, a, regional, ally, and, led, to, a, revision, of, the, us, japan, defense, cooperation, guidelines, in, 2015, in, response, the, prc, foreign, ministry, said, the, decision, raised, doubts, about, japan, s, commitment, to, peace, and, argued, that, the, japanese, public, is, opposed, to, the, concept, of, collective, self, defense, abe, argued, that, the, move, would, not, lead, to, japan, becoming, involved, in, foreign, wars, such, as, the, gulf, or, iraq, war, but, instead, would, secure, peace, through, deterrence, this, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, 2015, security, legislation, to, give, legal, effect, to, the, cabinet, s, decision, see, below, the, cabinet, inaugurated, in, december, 2012, was, the, longest, serving, and, most, stable, in, post, war, japanese, history, lasting, 617, days, without, a, change, in, personnel, until, abe, conducted, a, reshuffle, in, september, 2014, with, the, stated, aim, of, promoting, more, women, into, ministerial, posts, the, reshuffled, cabinet, tied, the, record, of, five, women, ministers, set, by, the, first, koizumi, cabinet, most, key, figures, such, as, deputy, prime, minister, aso, and, chief, cabinet, secretary, suga, were, kept, in, their, posts, although, abe, moved, justice, minister, sadakazu, tanigaki, out, of, the, cabinet, to, become, secretary, general, of, the, ldp, however, on, 20, october, two, of, the, women, promoted, in, the, reshuffle, justice, minister, midori, matsushima, and, trade, minister, y, ko, obuchi, were, forced, to, resign, in, separate, election, finance, scandals, abe, told, the, press, as, prime, minister, i, bear, full, responsibility, for, having, appointed, them, and, i, apologize, deeply, to, the, people, of, japan, in, november, 2014, while, abe, was, attending, the, apec, forum, meeting, in, the, prc, and, the, g20, summit, in, australia, rumors, began, appearing, in, the, press, that, he, was, planning, to, call, a, snap, election, in, the, event, that, he, decided, to, delay, the, second, stage, of, the, consumption, tax, increase, it, was, speculated, that, abe, planned, to, do, this, to, reset, diet, business, after, it, had, become, gridlocked, due, to, the, fallout, from, ministerial, resignations, in, october, or, because, the, political, situation, would, be, less, favorable, to, re, election, in, 2015, and, 2016, on, 17, november, gdp, figures, were, released, that, showed, japan, had, fallen, into, recession, as, per, the, two, quarters, of, negative, growth, following, the, first, stage, of, the, consumption, tax, rise, in, april, abe, held, a, press, conference, on, 21, november, and, announced, that, he, was, delaying, the, rise, in, the, consumption, tax, by, 18, months, from, october, 2015, to, april, 2017, and, calling, a, snap, general, election, for, 14, december, abe, described, the, election, as, the, abenomics, dissolution, and, asked, the, voters, to, pass, judgment, on, his, economic, policies, abe, s, popularity, fell, slightly, with, the, announcement, and, he, declared, that, he, would, resign, if, his, coalition, did, not, win, a, simple, majority, though, analysts, agreed, this, was, highly, unlikely, due, to, the, weak, state, of, the, opposition, the, opposition, parties, attempted, to, field, a, united, front, in, opposition, to, abe, s, policies, but, found, themselves, divided, on, them, in, the, 2014, general, election, the, ldp, won, 291, seats, a, loss, of, 3, but, the, komeito, gained, 4, to, win, 35, therefore, the, governing, coalition, maintained, its, two, thirds, majority, in, a, slightly, reduced, lower, house, of, 475, on, 24, december, 2014, abe, was, re, elected, to, the, position, of, prime, minister, by, the, house, of, representatives, the, only, change, he, made, when, introducing, his, third, cabinet, was, replacing, defense, minister, akinori, eto, who, was, also, involved, in, a, political, funding, controversy, with, gen, nakatani, in, his, february, policy, speech, as, the, cabinet, weathered, a, moritomo, gakuen, school, scandal, abe, called, upon, the, new, diet, to, enact, most, drastic, reforms, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, the, sectors, of, the, economy, agriculture, healthcare, and, others, on, a, tour, of, the, middle, east, in, january, 2015, abe, announced, that, japan, would, provide, 200, million, dollars, in, non, military, assistance, to, countries, fighting, against, the, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, as, part, of, a, 2, 5, billion, dollar, aid, package, shortly, after, this, isil, released, a, video, in, which, a, masked, figure, identified, as, mohammed, emwazi, or, jihadi, john, threatened, to, kill, two, japanese, hostages, kenji, goto, and, haruna, yukawa, in, retaliation, for, the, move, unless, abe, s, government, paid, 200, million, dollars, of, ransom, money, abe, cut, short, his, trip, to, deal, with, the, crisis, declared, that, such, acts, of, terrorism, were, unforgivable, and, promised, to, save, the, hostages, while, refusing, to, pay, the, ransom, the, abe, cabinet, worked, with, the, jordanian, government, to, attempt, to, secure, the, release, of, both, hostages, after, further, videos, were, released, by, isil, linking, their, fate, to, that, of, the, pilot, muath, al, kasasbeh, with, deputy, foreign, minister, yasuhide, nakayama, conducting, negotiations, in, amman, both, hostages, were, killed, with, isil, releasing, news, of, yukawa, s, death, on, 24, january, and, goto, s, on, 31, january, abe, condemned, the, killings, as, a, heinous, act, declared, that, japan, would, not, give, in, to, terrorism, and, pledged, to, work, with, the, international, community, to, bring, the, killers, to, justice, there, was, some, criticism, of, abe, for, his, move, to, pledge, aid, against, isil, while, they, were, holding, japanese, citizens, hostage, but, polls, showed, support, for, his, administration, increasing, in, the, aftermath, of, the, crisis, he, later, used, the, example, of, the, hostage, crisis, to, argue, the, case, for, the, collective, self, defense, legislation, that, his, government, introduced, in, the, summer, of, 2015, see, below, in, april, 2015, abe, addressed, a, joint, session, of, the, united, states, congress, the, first, japanese, prime, minister, to, do, so, in, his, speech, he, referred, to, the, japan, us, alliance, as, the, alliance, of, hope, promised, that, japan, would, play, a, more, active, security, and, defense, role, in, the, alliance, and, argued, that, the, tpp, would, bring, both, economic, and, security, benefits, to, the, asia, pacific, region, the, address, served, as, part, of, a, state, visit, to, the, united, states, the, eighth, of, the, obama, presidency, which, president, obama, referred, to, as, a, celebration, of, the, ties, of, friendship, between, america, and, japan, during, the, visit, abe, attended, a, state, dinner, at, the, white, house, like, his, predecessors, tomiichi, murayama, and, junichiro, koizumi, abe, issued, a, statement, commemorating, the, 70th, anniversary, of, the, end, of, world, war, ii, on, 14, august, 2015, this, statement, had, been, widely, anticipated, with, some, commentators, expecting, abe, to, amend, or, even, refuse, to, repeat, the, previous, leaders, apologies, for, japan, s, role, in, the, war, in, the, statement, abe, committed, to, upholding, the, previous, apologies, and, expressed, profound, grief, and, eternal, sincere, condolences, for, the, immeasurable, damage, and, suffering, japan, had, caused, for, innocent, people, during, the, conflict, he, also, argued, that, japan, should, not, be, predestined, to, apologize, forever, noting, that, more, than, eighty, percent, of, japanese, people, alive, today, were, born, after, the, conflict, and, played, no, part, in, it, the, governments, of, both, china, and, south, korea, responded, with, criticism, of, the, statement, but, analysts, noted, that, it, was, muted, and, restrained, in, tone, in, comparison, to, the, harsher, rhetoric, than, had, been, employed, previously, a, representative, of, the, us, national, security, council, welcomed, the, statement, and, referred, to, japan, as, having, been, a, model, for, nations, everywhere, in, its, record, on, peace, democracy, and, the, rule, of, law, since, the, war, s, end, professor, gerald, curtis, of, columbia, university, argued, that, the, statement, probably, satisfies, no, constituency, either, in, japan, or, abroad, but, that, by, repeating, the, words, aggression, colonialism, apology, and, remorse, used, in, the, murayama, statement, of, 1995, it, was, likely, to, be, enough, to, improve, relations, with, china, and, korea, in, december, 2015, abe, and, indian, prime, minister, narendra, modi, signed, deals, in, which, india, agreed, to, buy, shinkansen, technology, from, japan, financed, in, part, by, a, loan, from, the, japanese, government, and, for, japan, to, be,

attend, the, ganga, aarti, ceremony, at, dashashwamedh, ghat, in, his, varanasi, constituency, analysts, described, the, nuclear, deal, as, part, of, japan, and, india, s, efforts, to, respond, to,

issue, in, the, future, president, park, stated, that, the, agreement, would, be, a, new, starting, point, for, relations, between, the, two, countries, although, both, leaders, received, some,

that, japan, would, be, more, committed, to, japan, united, states, relations, they, also, golfed, alongside, south, african, professional, golfer, ernie, els, in, his, april, speech, to, the, us, congress, abe, announced, that, his, government, would, enact, all, necessary, bills, by, this, coming, summer, to, expand, the, self, defense, forces, capacity, for, operations, and, to, give, effect, to, the, cabinet, s, july, 2014, decision, to, re, interpret, the, constitution, in, favor, of, collective, self, defense, the, abe, cabinet, then, introduced, 11, bills, making, up, the, peace, and, security, preservation, legislation, into, the, diet, in, may, 2015, which, pushed, for, a, limited, expansion, of, military, powers, to, fight, in, a, foreign, conflict, the, principal, aims, of, the, bills, were, to, allow, japan, s, self, defense, forces, to, come, to, the, aid, of, allied, nations, under, attack, even, if, japan, itself, was, not, to, expand, their, scope, to, support, international, peacekeeping, operations, and, to, allow, for, japan, to, take, on, a, greater, share, of, security, responsibilities, as, part, of, the, us, japan, alliance, to, allow, for, enough, time, to, pass, the, bills, in, the, face, of, lengthy, opposition, scrutiny, the, abe, cabinet, extended, the, diet, session, by, 95, days, from, june, into, september, making, it, the,

through, without, sufficient, debate, and, ignore, responsible, opposition, parties, abe, countered, by, arguing, that, the, bills, had, been, debated, for, as, many, as, 113, hours, before, the, vote, while, common, practice, in, many, other, parliamentary, democracies, a, government, using, its, majority, to, railroad, controversial, bills, through, the, diet, in, the, face, of, political, and, public, opposition, is, a, subject, of, criticism, in, japan, as, a, result, of, these, moves, abe, faced, a, public, backlash, and, opinion, polls, showed, that, his, approval, ratings, fell, into, negative, figures, for, the, first, time, since, he, returned, to, power, in, 2012, with, 50, percent, disapproving, and, 38, percent, approving, of, the, cabinet, according, to, one, nikkei,

atomic, bomb, survivor, sumiteru, taniguchi, in, his, speech, at, the, nagasaki, memorial, ceremony, on, 9, august, when, he, stated, that, the, defense, reforms, would, take, japan, back, to, the, wartime, period, members, of, the, abe, cabinet, said, that, they, would, make, a, greater, effort, to, explain, the, contents, of, and, the, reasons, for, the, security, legislation, to, the, public, with, the, ldp, releasing, an, animated, cartoon, commercial, and, abe, appearing, live, on, television, and, internet, chat, streams, to, make, the, case, for, the, legislation, and, take, questions, from, members, of, the, public, the, security, bills, were, finally, approved, by, the, house, of, councillors, 148, votes, to, 90, and, became, law, on, 19, september, this, followed, opposition, attempts, using, delaying, tactics, as, well, as, physical, altercations, in, which, some, diet, members, attempted, to, stop, the, relevant, chairman, from, calling, the, vote, to, move, the, bill, out, of, committee, and, to, a, general, vote, after, the, vote, abe, issued, a, statement, saying, that, the, new, laws, will, fortify, our, pledge, to, never, again, wage, war, and, that, the, legislation, rather, than, being, war, bills, was, instead, aimed, at, deterring, war, and, contributing, to, peace, and, security, he, also, pledged, to, continue, to, explain, the, legislation, to, try, to, gain, greater, understanding, from, the, public, on, the, issue, following, the, bills, passage, abe, was, expected, to, once, again, return, his, focus, to, economic, issues, on, 18, october, 2015, abe, presided, over, the, triennial, fleet, review, of, the, japan, maritime, self, defense, force, jmsdf, in, his, role, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, self, defense, forces, in, his, speech, to, personnel, on, board, the, destroyer, kurama, he, announced, that, by, highly, hoisting, the, flag, of, proactive, pacifism, i, m, determined, to, contribute, more, than, ever, to, world, peace, and, prosperity, later, that, day, he, went, aboard, the, uss, ronald, reagan, becoming, the, first, japanese, prime, minister, to, set, foot, on, an, american, warship, in, december, 2015, the, abe, government, announced, the, creation, of, a, new, intelligence, unit, the, international, counterterrorism, intelligence, collection, unit, to, aid, counter, terrorism, operations, to, be, based, in, the, foreign, ministry, but, led, by, the, prime, minister, s, office, this, was, reported, as, being, part, of, efforts, to, step, up, security, measures, in, preparation, for, the, 2016, g7, summit, in, shima, mie, and, 2020, olympics, in, tokyo, in, the, same, month, the, cabinet, approved, japan, s, largest, ever, defense, budget, at, 5, 1, trillion, yen, us, 45, billion, for,

midair, refueling, aircraft, in, september, 2015, abe, was, re, elected, as, president, of, the, ldp, in, an, uncontested, election, after, ldp, diet, member, seiko, noda, failed, to, garner, enough, support, to, stand, as, a, candidate, following, this, abe, carried, out, a, cabinet, reshuffle, once, again, keeping, the, key, ministers, of, finance, economy, foreign, affairs, and, the, chief, cabinet, secretary, in, post, he, also, created, a, new, ministerial, position, for, the, coordination, of, policies, related, to, the, economy, population, decline, and, social, security, reform, which, was, filled, by, katsunobu, kat, at, a, press, conference, after, his, official, re, election, as, ldp, president, abe, announced, that, the, next, stage, of, his, administration, would, focus, on, what, he, called, abenomics, 2, 0, the, aim, of, which, was, to, tackle, issues, of, low, fertility, and, an, aging, population, and, create, a, society, in, which, each, and, every, one, of, japan, s, 100, million, citizens, can, take, on, active, roles, this, new, policy, consisted, of, targets, which, abe, referred, to, as, three, new, arrows, to, boost, japan, s, gdp, to, 600, trillion, yen, by, 2021, to, raise, the, national, fertility, rate, from, an, average, of, 1, 4, to, 1, 8, children, per, woman, and, stabilize, the, population, at, 100, million, and, to, create, a, situation, where, people, would, not, have, to, leave, employment, to, care, for, elderly, relatives, by, the, mid, 2020s, abe, explained, that, the, government, would, take, measures, to, increase, wages, boost, consumption, and, expand, childcare, social, security, and, care, services, for, the, elderly, to, meet, these, goals, this, new, iteration, of, abenomics, was, met, with, some, criticism, by, commentators, who, argued, that, it, was, not, yet, clear, if, the, first, three, arrows, had, succeeded, in, lifting, japan, out, of, deflation, inflation, was, some, way, below, the, 2, percent, target, that, the, new, arrows, were, merely, presented, as, targets, without, the, necessary, policies, to, meet, them, and, that, the, targets, themselves, were, unrealistic, however, opinion, polls, during, the, final, months, of, 2015, showed, the, abe, cabinet, s, approval, ratings, once, again, climbing, into, positive, figures, after, the, change, in, emphasis, back, to, economic, issues, at, the, conclusion, of, the, trans, pacific, partnership, talks, in, early, october, 2015, abe, hailed, the, agreement, for, creating, an, unprecedented, economic, zone, and, opening, up, possibilities, for, an, even, wider, asia, pacific, free, trade, deal, and, japanese, trade, with, europe, he, also, promised, to, mitigate, any, negative, effects, on, the, japanese, agricultural, sector, gdp, figures, released, in, november, 2015, initially, appeared, to, show, that, japan, had, entered, a, second, recession, since, the, implementation, of, abenomics, however, these, figures, were, subsequently, revised, to, show, that, the, economy, had, grown, by, 1, percent, in, the, third, quarter, thus, avoiding, recession, in, december, 2015, the, two, parties, making, up, abe, s, governing, coalition, agreed, to, introduce, a, reduced, rate, of, consumption, tax, for, food, when, the, anticipated, tax, increase, from, 8, to, 10, percent, takes, place, in, april, 2017, this, deal, was, reached, after, abe, was, seen, to, come, down, strongly, in, favor, of, the, position, held, by, his, junior, coalition, partner, the, komeito, that, the, tax, rate, should, be, reduced, which, prompted, some, disagreement, from, members, of, his, party, who, favored, a, policy, of, greater, fiscal, consolidation, through, taxes, abe, dismissed, the, chairman, of, the, ldp, s, tax, panel, takeshi, noda, who, opposed, the, reduction, and, appointed, yoichi, miyazawa, who, was, more, favorable, to, the, policy, as, his, replacement, abe, declared, the, tax, deal, to, be, the, best, possible, result, of, the, negotiations, at, the, 2016, election, to, the, house, of, councillors, the, first, that, allowed, japanese, citizens, 18, and, over, to, vote, abe, led, the, ldp, komeito, pact, to, victory, with, the, coalition, being, the, largest, in, the, house, of, councillors, since, it, was, set, at, 242, seats, the, election, s, results, opened, the, debate, on, constitutional, reform, particularly, in, amending, article, 9, of, japan, s, pacifist, constitution, with, pro, revisionist, parties, gaining, the, two, thirds, majority, being, necessary, for, reform, alongside, a, two, thirds, majority, in, the, house, of, representatives, which, would, ultimately, lead, to, a, nationwide, referendum, abe, remained, relatively, quiet, on, the, issue, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, but, in, may, 2017, announced, that, the, constitutional, reform, would, be, in, effect, by, 2020, the, 2017, general, election, was, held, on, 22, october, prime, minister, abe, called, the, snap, election, on, 25, september, while, the, north, korea, crisis, was, prominent, in, the, news, media, political, opponents, of, abe, say, the, snap, election, was, designed, to, evade, questioning, in, parliament, over, alleged, scandals, abe, was, expected, to, retain, a, majority, of, seats, in, the, diet, abe, s, ruling, coalition, took, almost, a, majority, of, the, vote, and, two, thirds, of, the, seats, the, last, minute, campaigning, and, voting, took, place, as, typhoon, lan, the, biggest, typhoon, of, 2017, was, wreaking, havoc, on, japan, on, 20,
