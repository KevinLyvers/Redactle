samvada, is, a, text, where, devahuti, approaches, kapil, with, a, dilemma, she, mentions, that, she, is, fed, up, of, satisfying, her, five, senses, she, states, that, all, her, life, she, has, been, giving, in, to, these, senses, but, they, are, never, satisfied, kapila, explains, the, samkhya, philosophy, to, set, her, mind, at, ease, and, give, her, inner, peace, this, discussion, is, in, the, form, of, question, and, answers, format, this, has, been, mentioned, in, detail, in, the, third, canto, of, shrimad, bhagavata, purana, kapila, is, mentioned, in, chapter, viii, of, the, uttaradhyayana, sutra, states, larson, and, bhattacharya, where, a, discourse, of, poetical, verses, is, titled, as, kaviliyam, or, kapila, s, verses, the, name, kapila, appears, in, jaina, texts, for, example, in, the, 12th, century, hemacandra, s, epic, poem, on, jain, elders, kapila, appears, as, a, brahmin, who, converted, to, jainism, during, the, nanda, empire, era, according, to, jnatadharmakatha, kapila, is, a, contemporary, of, krishna, and, the, vasudeva, of, dhatakikhanda, the, text, further, mentions, that, both, of, them, blew, their, shankha, conch, shell, together, buddhists, literature, such, as, the, jataka, tales, state, the, buddha, is, kapila, in, one, of, his, previous, lives, scholars, have, long, compared, and, associated, the, teachings, of, kapila, and, buddha, for, example, max, muller, wrote, abridged, there, are, no, doubt, certain, notions, which, buddha, shares, in, common, not, only, with, kapila, but, with, every, hindu, philosopher, it, has, been, said, that, buddha, and, kapila, were, both, atheists, and, that, buddha, borrowed, his, atheism, from, kapila, but, atheism, is, an, indefinite, term, and, may, mean, very, different, things, in, one, sense, every, indian, philosopher, was, an, atheist, for, they, all, perceived, that, the, gods, of, the, populace, could, not, claim, the, attributes, that, belong, to, a, supreme, being, absolute, the, source, of, all, that, exists, or, seems, to, exist, brahman, kapila, when, accused, of, atheism, is, not, accused, of, denying, the, existence, of, an, absolute, being, he, is, accused, of, denying, the, existence, of, an, ishvara, max, muller, states, the, link, between, the, more, ancient, kapila, s, teachings, on, buddha, can, be, overstated, this, confusion, is, easy, states, muller, because, kapila, s, first, sutra, in, his, classic, samkhya, sutra, the, complete, cessation, of, pain, which, is, of, three, kinds, is, the, highest, aim, of, man, sounds, like, the, natural, inspiration, for, buddha, however, adds, muller, the, teachings, on, how, to, achieve, this, by, kapila, and, by, buddha, are, very, different, as, buddhist, art, often, depicts, vedic, deities, one, can, find, art, of, both, narayana, and, kapila, as, kings, within, a, buddhist, temple, along, with, statues, of, buddhist, figures, such, as, amitabha, maitreya, and, vairocana, in, chinese, buddhism, the, buddha, directed, the, yaksha, kapila, and, fifteen, daughters, of, devas, to, become, the, patrons, of, china, the, following, works, were, authored, by, kapila, some, of, which, are, lost, and, known, because, they, are, mentioned, in, other, works, while, few, others, are, unpublished, manuscripts, available, in, libraries, stated, ayurveda, books, mentioning, kapila, s, works, are, kapila, the, founder, of, samkhya, has, been, a, highly, revered, sage, in, various, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, gaudapada, 500, ce, an, advaita, vedanta, scholar, in, his, bhasya, called, kapila, as, one, of, the, seven, great, sages, along, with, sanaka, sananda, sanatana, asuri, vodhu, and, pancasikha, patanjali, the, yoga, scholar, in, his, yogasutra, bhasya, wrote, kapila, to, be, the, primal, wise, man, or, knower, the, buddhist, sources, mention, that, the, city, of, kapilavastu, is, built, in, the, honor, of, kapila, it, is, in, kapilavastu, that, the, buddha, is, born, and, it, is, here, he, spent, the, first, twenty, nine, years, of, his, life
