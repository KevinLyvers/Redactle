me, because, he, was, my, close, friend, the, truth, is, that, he, became, my, close, friend, because, he, wanted, to, defend, me, he, and, i, found, ourselves, describing, our, ideas, without, conferring, in, almost, identical, terms, i, began, to, understand, that, while, i, had, not, chosen, the, battle, it, was, at, least, the, right, battle, because, in, it, everything, that, i, loved,

i, had, written, a, more, critical, book, and, i, m, very, sad, that, it, should, have, happened, it, s, not, true, that, this, book, is, a, blasphemy, against, islam, i, doubt, very, much, that, khomeini, or, anyone, else, in, iran, has, read, the, book, or, more, than, selected, extracts, out, of, context, later, he, wrote, that, he, was, proud, then, and, always, of, that, statement, while,

vow, to, kill, him, and, has, jokingly, referred, to, it, as, my, unfunny, valentine, he, said, it, s, reached, the, point, where, it, s, a, piece, of, rhetoric, rather, than, a, real, threat, despite, the, threats, on, rushdie, personally, he, said, that, his, family, has, never, been, threatened, and, that, his, mother, who, lived, in, pakistan, during, the, later, years, of, her, life, even, received, outpourings, of, support, rushdie, himself, has, been, prevented, from, entering, pakistan, however, a, former, bodyguard, to, rushdie, ron, evans, planned, to, publish, a, book,

out, imam, khomeini, s, fatw, against, the, renegade, salman, rushdie, this, rabble, who, insult, our, prophet, mohammed, in, denmark, norway, and, france, would, not, have, dared, to, do, so, i, am, sure, there, are, millions, of, muslims, who, are, ready, to, give, their, lives, to, defend, our, prophet, s, honour, and, we, have, to, be, ready, to, do, anything, for, that, in, 1990, soon, after, the, publication, of, the, satanic, verses, a, pakistani, film, entitled, international, gorillay, international, guerillas, was, released, that, depicted, rushdie, as, a, james, bond, style, villain, plotting, to, cause, the, downfall, of, pakistan, by, opening, a, chain, of, casinos, and, discos, in, the, country, he, is, ultimately, killed, at, the, end, of, the, movie, the, film, was, popular, with, pakistani, audiences, and, it, presents, rushdie, as, a, rambo, like, figure, pursued, by, four, pakistani, guerrillas, the, british, board, of, film, classification, refused, to, allow, it, a, certificate, it, was, felt, that, the, portrayal, of, rushdie, might, qualify, as, criminal, libel, causing, a, breach, of, the, peace, as, opposed, to, merely, tarnishing, his, reputation, this, effectively, prevented, the, release, of, the, film, in, the, uk, two, months, later, however, rushdie, himself, wrote, to, the, board, saying, that, while, he, thought, the, film, a, distorted, incompetent, piece, of, trash, he, would, not, sue, if, it, were, released, he, later, said, if, that, film, had, been, banned, it, would, have, become, the, hottest, video, in, town, everyone, would, have, seen, it, while, the, film, was, a, great, hit, in, pakistan, it, went, virtually, unnoticed, elsewhere, in, 2010, anwar, al, awlaki, published, an, al, qaeda, hit, list, in, inspire, magazine,

must, to, defend, the, art, of, satire, which, has, always, been, a, force, for, liberty, and, against, tyranny, dishonesty, and, stupidity, religious, totalitarianism, has, caused, a, deadly, mutation, in, the, heart, of, islam, and, we, see, the, tragic, consequences, in, paris, today, in, response, to, the, attack, rushdie, commented, on, what, he, perceived, as, victim, blaming, in, the, media, stating, you, can, dislike, charlie, hebdo, but, the, fact, that, you, dislike, them, has, nothing, to, do, with, their, right, to, speak, the, fact, you, dislike, them, certainly, doesn, t, in, any, way, excuse, their, murder, rushdie, was, due, to, appear, at, the, jaipur, literature, festival, in, january, 2012, in, jaipur, rajasthan, india, however, he, later, cancelled, his, event, appearance, and, a, further, tour, of, india, at, the, time, citing, a, possible, threat, to, his, life, as, the, primary, reason, several, days, after, he, indicated, that, state, police,

rushdie, would, read, from, the, banned, the, satanic, verses, and, that, the, threat, was, real, considering, imminent, protests, by, muslim, organizations, meanwhile, indian, authors, ruchir, joshi,

the, knighthood, was, an, insult, to, muslims, christopher, hitchens, answered, midnight, s, children, did, not, just, win, the, booker, and, salman, did, not, just, later, win, the, booker, of,

his, own, country, into, beggary, and, bankruptcy, and, misery, every, arab, and, muslim, writer, worthy, of, the, name, all, signed, and, wrote, in, a, book, for, salman, we, identify, our, cause, with, you, and, your, struggle, with, free, expression, in, our, culture, if, you, say, that, muslims, are, being, offended, by, this, and, you, lump, them, all, together, you, immediately, grant, that, they, are, in, fact, represented, by, the, most, extreme, homicidal, fanatical, illiterate, intolerant, people, who, not, only, haven, t, read, this, book, but, couldn, t, read, it, and, that, s, an, insult, to, islam, rushdie, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, order, of, the, companions, of, honour, ch, in, the, 2022, birthday, honours, for, services, to, literature, rushdie, came, from, a, liberal, muslim, family, but, he, is, an, atheist, in, a, 2006, interview, with, pbs, rushdie, called, himself, a, hardline, atheist, in, 1989, in, an, interview, following, the, fatwa, rushdie, said, that, he, was, in, a, sense, a, lapsed, muslim, though, shaped, by, muslim, culture, more, than, any, other, and, a, student, of, islam, in, another, interview, the, same, year, he, said, my, point, of, view, is, that, of, a, secular, human, being, i, do, not, believe, in, supernatural, entities, whether, christian, jewish, muslim, or, hindu, in, december, 1990, rushdie, issued, a, statement, reaffirming, his, muslim, faith, distancing, himself, from, statements, made, by, characters, in, satanic, verses, that, cast, aspersion, on, islam, or, prophet, mohammad, and, opposing, the, release, of, the, paperback, editing, of, the, novel, later, in, 1992, he, cited, the, release, of, the, statement, as, perhaps, his, lowest, point, regretting, its, language, which, he, said, he, had, not, written, rushdie, advocates, the, application, of, higher, criticism, pioneered, during, the, late, 19th, century, in, a, guest, opinion, piece, printed, in, the, washington, post, and, the, times, in, mid, august, 2005, rushdie, called, for, a, reform, in, islam, what, is, needed, is, a, move, beyond, tradition, nothing, less, than, a, reform, movement, to, bring, the, core, concepts, of, islam, into, the, modern, age, a, muslim, reformation, to, combat, not, only, the, jihadist, ideologues, but, also, the, dusty, stifling, seminaries, of, the, traditionalists, throwing, open, the, windows, to, let, in, much, needed, fresh, air, it, is, high, time, for, starters, that, muslims, were, able, to, study, the, revelation, of, their, religion, as, an, event, inside, history, not, supernaturally, above, it, broad, mindedness, is, related, to, tolerance, open, mindedness, is, the, sibling, of, peace, rushdie, is, a, critic, of, moral, and, cultural, relativism, in, an, interview, with, point, of, inquiry, in, 2006, he, described, his, view, as, follows, we, need, all, of, us, whatever, our, background, to, constantly, examine, the, stories, inside, which, and, with, which, we, live, we, all, live, in, stories, so, called, grand, narratives, nation, is, a, story, family, is, a, story, religion, is, a, story, community, is, a, story, we, all, live, within, and, with, these, narratives, and, it, seems, to, me, that, a, definition, of, any, living, vibrant, society, is, that, you, constantly, question, those, stories, that, you, constantly, argue, about, the, stories, in, fact, the, arguing, never, stops, the, argument, itself, is, freedom, it, s, not, that, you, come, to, a, conclusion, about, it, and, through, that, argument, you, change, your, mind, sometimes, and, that, s, how, societies, grow, when, you, can, t, retell, for, yourself, the, stories, of, your, life, then, you, live, in, a, prison, somebody, else, controls, the, story, now, it, seems, to, me, that, we, have, to, say, that, a, problem, in, contemporary, islam, is, the, inability, to, re, examine, the, ground, narrative, of, the, religion, the, fact, that, in, islam, it, is, very, difficult, to, do, this, makes, it, difficult, to, think, new, thoughts, rushdie, is, an, advocate, of, religious, satire, he, condemned, the, charlie, hebdo, shooting, and, defended, comedic, criticism, of, religions, in, a, comment, originally, posted, on, english, pen, where, he, called, religions, a, medieval, form, of, unreason, rushdie, called, the, attack, a, consequence, of, religious, totalitarianism, which, according, to, him, had, caused, a, deadly, mutation, in, the, heart, of, islam, he, said, religion, a, medieval, form, of, unreason, when, combined, with, modern, weaponry, becomes, a, real, threat, to, our, freedoms, this, religious, totalitarianism, has, caused, a, deadly, mutation, in, the, heart, of, islam, and, we, see, the, tragic, consequences, in, paris, today, i, stand, with, charlie, hebdo, as, we, all, must, to, defend, the, art, of, satire, which, has, always, been, a, force, for, liberty, and, against, tyranny, dishonesty, and, stupidity, respect, for, religion, has, become, a, code, phrase, meaning, fear, of, religion, religions, like, all, other, ideas, deserve, criticism, satire, and, yes, our, fearless, disrespect, when, asked, about, reading, and, writing, as, a, human, right, rushdie, states, there, are, the, larger, stories, the, grand, narratives, that, we, live, in, which, are, things, like, nation, and, family, and, clan, and, so, on, those, stories, are, considered, to, be, treated, reverentially, they, need, to, be, part, of, the, way, in, which, we, conduct, the, discourse, of, our, lives, and, to, prevent, people, from, doing, something, very, damaging, to, human, nature, though, rushdie, believes, the, freedoms, of, literature, to, be, universal, the, bulk, of, his, fictions, portrays, the, struggles, of, the, marginally, underrepresented, this, can, be, seen, in, his, portrayal, of, the, role, of, women, in, his, novel, shame, in, this, novel, rushdie, suggests, that, it, is, women, who, suffer, most, from, the, injustices, of, the, pakistani, social, order, his, support, of, feminism, can, also, be, seen, in, a, 2015, interview, with, new, york, magazine, s, the, cut, in, 2006, rushdie, stated, that, he, supported, comments, by, jack, straw, then, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, from, labour, who, criticized, the, wearing, of, the, niqab, a, veil, that, covers, all, of,

destruction, and, rape, and, brutalisation, that, happens, all, the, time, it, s, still, happening, now, the, decision, to, treat, all, kashmiris, as, if, they, re, potential, terrorists, is, what, has, unleashed, this, the, kind, of, holocaust, against, the, kashmiri, people, and, we, know, ourselves, from, most, recent, events, in, europe, how, important, it, is, to, resist, treating, all, muslims, as, if, they, re, terrorists, but, the, indian, army, has, taken, the, decision, to, do, the, opposite, of, that, to, actually, decide, that, everybody, is, a, potential, combatant, to, treat, them, in, that, way, and, the, level, of, brutality, is, quite, spectacular, and, frankly, without, that, the, jihadists, would, have, had, very, little, response, from, the, kashmiri, people, who, were, not, really, traditionally, interested, in, radical, islam, so, now, they, re, caught, between, the, devil, and, the, deep, blue, sea, and, that, s, the, tragedy, of, the, place, and,
