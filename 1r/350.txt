limited, folkloric, ukrainian, particularism, as, part, of, the, heritage, of, the, russian, empire, in, 1831, the, first, volume, of, gogol, s, ukrainian, stories, evenings, on, a, farm, near, dikanka, was, published, under, a, pen, name, rudy, panko, was, in, line, with, this, trend, and, met, with, immediate, success, a, second, volume, was, published, in, 1832, followed, by, two, volumes, of, stories, entitled, mirgorod, in, 1835, and, two, volumes, of, miscellaneous, prose, entitled, arabesques, at, this, time, russian, editors, and, critics, such, as, nikolai, polevoy, and, nikolai, nadezhdin, saw, gogol, as, a, regional, ukrainian, writer, and, used, his, works, to, illustrate, the, specific, of, ukrainian, national, characters, the, themes, and, style, of, these, early, prose, works, by, gogol, as, well, as, his, later, drama, were, similar, to, the, work, of, ukrainian, language, writers, and, dramatists, who, were, his, contemporaries, and, friends, including, hryhory, kvitka, osnovyanenko, however, gogol, s, satire, was, much, more, sophisticated, and, unconventional, although, these, works, were, written, in, russian, they, were, nevertheless, full, of, ukrainianisms, which, is, why, a, glossary, of, ukrainian, words, was, included, at, the, end, of, the, volumes, at, this, time, gogol, developed, a, passion, for, ukrainian, cossack, history, and, tried, to, obtain, an, appointment, to, the, history, department, at, saint, vladimir, imperial, university, of, kiev, despite, the, support, of, alexander, pushkin, and, sergey, uvarov, the, russian, minister, of, education, the, appointment, was, blocked, by, a, bureaucrat, on, the, grounds, that, gogol, was, unqualified, his, fictional, story, taras, bulba, based, on, the, history, of, zaporozhian, ossacks, was, the, result, of, this, phase, in, his, interests, during, this, time, he, also, developed, a, close, and, lifelong, friendship, with, the, historian, and, naturalist, mykhaylo, maksymovych, in, 1834, gogol, was, made, professor, of, medieval, history, at, the, university, of, st, petersburg, a, job, for, which, he, had, no, qualifications, the, academic, venture, proved, a, disaster, he, turned, in, a, performance, ludicrous, enough, to, warrant, satiric, treatment, in, one, of, his, own, stories, after, an, introductory, lecture, made, up, of, brilliant, generalizations, which, the, historian, had, prudently, prepared, and, memorized, he, gave, up, all, pretence, at, erudition, and, teaching, missed, two, lectures, out, of, three, and, when, he, did, appear, muttered, unintelligibly, through, his, teeth, at, the, final, examination, he, sat, in, utter, silence, with, a, black, handkerchief, wrapped, around, his, head, simulating, a, toothache, while, another, professor, interrogated, the, students, gogol, resigned, his, chair, in, 1835, between, 1832, and, 1836, gogol, worked, with, great, energy, and, had, extensive, contact, with, pushkin, but, he, still, had, not, yet, decided, that, his, ambitions, were, to, be, fulfilled, by, success, in, literature, during, this, time, the, russian, critics, stepan, shevyrev, and, vissarion, belinsky, contradicting, the, earlier, critics, reclassified, gogol, from, a, ukrainian, to, a, russian, writer, it, was, only, after, the, premiere, of, his, comedy, the, government, inspector, revizor, at, the, alexandrinsky, theatre, in, st, petersburg, on, 19, april, 1836, that, he, finally, came, to, believe, in, his, literary, vocation, the, comedy, a, satire, of, russian, provincial, bureaucracy, was, staged, thanks, only, to, the, intervention, of, the, emperor, nicholas, i, the, tsar, was, personally, present, at, the, play, s, premiere, concluding, that, there, is, nothing, sinister, in, the, comedy, as, it, is, only, a, cheerful, mockery, of, bad, provincial, officials, from, 1836, to, 1848, gogol, lived, abroad, travelling, through, germany, and, switzerland, gogol, spent, the, winter, of, 1836, 37, in, paris, among, russian, expatriates, and, polish, exiles, frequently, meeting, the, polish, poets, adam, mickiewicz, and, bohdan, zaleski, he, eventually, settled, in, rome, for, much, of, the, twelve, years, from, 1836, gogol, was, in, italy, where, he, developed, an, adoration, for, rome, he, studied, art, read, italian, literature, and, developed, a, passion, for, opera, pushkin, s, death, produced, a, strong, impression, on, gogol, his, principal, work, during, the, years, following, pushkin, s, death, was, the, satirical, epic, dead, souls, concurrently, he, worked, at, other, tasks, recast, taras, bulba, 1842, and, the, portrait, completed, his, second, comedy, marriage, zhenitba, wrote, the, fragment, rome, and, his, most, famous, short, story, the, overcoat, in, 1841, the, first, part, of, dead, souls, was, ready, and, gogol, took, it, to, russia, to, supervise, its, printing, it, appeared, in, moscow, in, 1842, under, a, new, title, imposed, by, the, censorship, the, adventures, of, chichikov, the, book, established, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, greatest, prose, writers, in, the, language, after, the, triumph, of, dead, souls, gogol, s, contemporaries, came, to, regard, him, as, a, great, satirist, who, lampooned, the, unseemly, sides, of, imperial, russia, they, did, not, know, that, dead, souls, was, but, the, first, part, of, a, planned, modern, day, counterpart, to, the, divine, comedy, of, dante, the, first, part, represented, the, inferno, the, second, part, would, depict, the, gradual, purification, and, transformation, of, the, rogue, chichikov, under, the, influence, of, virtuous, publicans, and, governors, purgatory, in, april, 1848, gogol, returned, to, russia, from, a, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, and, passed, his, last, years, in, restless, movement, throughout, the, country, while, visiting, the, capitals, he, stayed, with, friends, such, as, mikhail, pogodin, and, sergey, aksakov, during, this, period, he, also, spent, much, time, with, his, old, ukrainian, friends, maksymovych, and, osyp, bodiansky, he, intensified, his, relationship, with, a, starets, or, spiritual, elder, matvey, konstantinovsky, whom, he, had, known, for, several, years, konstantinovsky, seems, to, have, strengthened, in, gogol, the, fear, of, perdition, damnation, by, insisting, on, the, sinfulness, of, all, his, imaginative, work, exaggerated, ascetic, practices, undermined, his, health, and, he, fell, into, a, state, of, deep, depression, on, the, night, of, 24, february, 1852, he, burned, some, of, his, manuscripts, which, contained, most, of, the, second, part, of, dead, souls, he, explained, this, as, a, mistake, a, practical, joke, played, on, him, by, the, devil, soon, thereafter, he, took, to, bed, refused, all, food, and, died, in, great, pain, nine, days, later, gogol, was, mourned, in, the, saint, tatiana, church, at, the, moscow, university, before, his, burial, and, then, buried, at, the, danilov, monastery, close, to, his, fellow, slavophile, aleksey, khomyakov, his, grave, was, marked, by, a, large, stone, golgotha, topped, by, a, russian, orthodox, cross, in, 1931, with, russia, now, ruled, by, communists, moscow, authorities, decided, to, demolish, the, monastery, and, had, gogol, s, remains, transferred, to, the, novodevichy, cemetery, his, body, was, discovered, lying, face, down, which, gave, rise, to, the, conspiracy, theory, that, gogol, had, been, buried, alive, the, authorities, moved, the, golgotha, stone, to, the, new, gravesite, but, removed, the, cross, in, 1952, the, soviets, replaced, the, stone, with, a, bust, of, gogol, the, stone, was, later, reused, for, the, tomb, of, gogol, s, admirer, mikhail, bulgakov, in, 2009, in, connection, with, the, bicentennial, of, gogol, s, birth, the, bust, was, moved, to, the, museum, at, the, novodevichy, cemetery, and, the, original, golgotha, stone, was, returned, along, with, a, copy, of, the, original, orthodox, cross, the, first, gogol, monument, in, moscow, a, symbolist, statue, on, arbat, square, represented, the, sculptor, nikolay, andreyev, s, idea, of, gogol, rather, than, the, real, man, unveiled, in, 1909, the, statue, received, praise, from, ilya, repin, and, from, leo, tolstoy, as, an, outstanding, projection, of, gogol, s, tortured, personality, everything, changed, after, the, october, revolution, joseph, stalin, did, not, like, the, statue, and, it, was, replaced, by, a, more, orthodox, socialist, realist, monument, in, 1952, it, took, enormous, efforts, to, save, andreyev, s, original, work, from, destruction, as, of, 2014, it, stands, in, front, of, the, house, where, gogol, died, d, s, mirsky, characterizes, gogol, s, universe, as, one, of, the, most, marvellous, unexpected, in, the, strictest, sense, original, worlds, ever, created, by, an, artist, of, words, gogol, saw, the, outer, world, strangely, metamorphosed, a, singular, gift, particularly, evident, from, the, fantastic, spatial, transformations, in, his, gothic, stories, a, terrible, vengeance, and, a, bewitched, place, his, pictures, of, nature, are, strange, mounds, of, detail, heaped, on, detail, resulting, in, an, unconnected, chaos, of, things, his, people, are, caricatures, drawn, with, the, method, of, the, caricaturist, which, is, to, exaggerate, salient, features, and, to, reduce, them, to, geometrical, pattern, but, these, cartoons, have, a, convincingness, a, truthfulness, and, inevitability, attained, as, a, rule, by, slight, but, definitive, strokes, of, unexpected, reality, that, seems, to, beggar, the, visible, world, itself, according, to, andrey, bely, gogol, s, work, influenced, the, emergence, of, gothic, romance, and, served, as, a, forerunner, for, absurdism, and, impressionism, the, aspect, under, which, the, mature, gogol, sees, reality, is, expressed, by, the, russian, word, poshlost, which, means, something, similar, to, triviality, banality, inferiority, moral, and, spiritual, widespread, in, a, group, of, people, or, the, entire, society, like, sterne, before, him, gogol, was, a, great, destroyer, of, prohibitions, and, of, romantic, illusions, he, undermined, russian, romanticism, by, making, vulgarity, reign, where, only, the, sublime, and, the, beautiful, had, before, characteristic, of, gogol, is, a, sense, of, boundless, superfluity, that, is, soon, revealed, as, utter, emptiness, and, a, rich, comedy, that, suddenly, turns, into, metaphysical, horror, his, stories, often, interweave, pathos, and, mockery, while, the, tale, of, how, ivan, ivanovich, quarreled, with, ivan, nikiforovich, begins, as, a, merry, farce, and, ends, with, the, famous, dictum, it, is, dull, in, this, world, gentlemen, it, stunned, gogol, when, some, critics, interpreted, the, government, inspector, as, an, indictment, of, tsarism, despite, nicholas, i, s, patronage, of, the, play, gogol, himself, an, adherent, of, the, slavophile, movement, believed, in, a, divinely, inspired, mission, for, both, the, house, of, romanov, and, the, russian, orthodox, church, like, fyodor, dostoyevsky, gogol, sharply, disagreed, with, those, russians, who, preached, constitutional, monarchy, and, the, disestablishment, of, the, orthodox, church, gogol, saw, his, work, as, a, critique, that, would, change, russia, for, the, better, after, defending, autocracy, serfdom, and, the, orthodox, church, in, his, book, selected, passages, from, correspondence, with, his, friends, 1847, gogol, came, under, attack, from, his, former, patron, vissarion, belinsky, the, first, russian, intellectual, to, publicly, preach, the, economic, theories, of, karl, marx, belinsky, accused, gogol, of, betraying, his, readership, by, defending, the, status, quo, gogol, was, born, in, the, ukrainian, cossack, town, of, sorochyntsi, according, to, edyta, bojanowska, gogol, s, images, of, ukraine, are, in, depth, distinguished, by, description, of, folklore, and, history, in, his, evenings, on, a, farm, gogol, pictures, ukraine, as, a, nation, united, by, organic, culture, historical, memory, and, language, his, image, of, russia, lacks, this, depth, and, is, always, based, in, the, present, particularly, focused, on, russia, s, bureaucracy, and, corruption, dead, souls, according, to, bojanowska, presents, russian, uniqueness, as, a, catalog, of, faults, and, vices, the, duality, of, gogol, s, national, identity, is, frequently, expressed, as, a, view, that, in, the, aesthetic, psychological, and, existential, senses, gogol, is, inscribed, into, ukrainian, culture, while, in, historical, and, cultural, terms, he, is, part, of, russian, literature, and, culture, slavicist, edyta, bojanowska, writes, that, gogol, after, arriving, in, st, peterburg, was, surprised, to, find, that, he, was, perceived, as, a, ukrainian, and, even, as, a, khokhol, hick, bojanowska, argues, that, it, was, this, experience, that, made, him, into, a, self, conscious, ukrainian, according, to, ilchuk, dual, national, identities, were, typical, at, that, time, as, a, compromise, with, the, empire, s, demand, for, national, homogenization, professor, of, russian, literature, kathleen, scollins, notes, the, tendency, to, politicize, gogol, s, identity, and, comments, on, the, erasure, of, gogol, s, ukrainianness, by, the, russian, literary, establishment, which, she, argues, reveals, the, insecurity, of, many, russians, about, their, own, imperial, identity, according, to, scollins, gogol, s, narrative, double, voicedness, in, both, evenings, and, taras, bulba, and, pidginized, russian, of, the, zaporizhian, cossacks, in, the, night, before, christmas, represents, a, strateg, of,

and, shaped, each, other, with, gogol, playing, a, key, role, in, these, processes, gogol, s, appreciation, of, ukraine, grew, during, his, discovery, of, ukrainian, history, and, he, concluded, that, ukraine, possessed, exactly, the, kind, of, cultural, wholeness, proud, tradition, and, self, awareness, that, russia, lacked, he, rejected, or, was, critical, of, many, of, the, postulates, of, official, russian, history, about, ukrainian, nationhood, his, unpublished, mazepa, s, meditations, presents, ukrainian, history, in, a, manner, that, justifies, ukraine, s, historic, right, to, independence, before, 1836, gogol, had, planned, to, move, to, kyiv, to, study, ukrainian, ethnography, and, history, and, it, was, after, these, plans, failed, that, he, decided, to, become, a, russian, writer, even, before, the, publication, of, dead, souls, belinsky, recognized, gogol, as, the, first, russian, language, realist, writer, and, as, the, head, of, the, natural, school, to, which, he, also, assigned, such, younger, or, lesser, authors, as, goncharov, turgenev, dmitry, grigorovich, vladimir, dahl, and, vladimir, sollogub, gogol, himself, appeared, skeptical, about, the, existence, of, such, a, literary, movement, although, he, recognized, several, young, writers, who, have, shown, a, particular, desire, to, observe, real, life, he, upbraided, the, deficient, composition, and, style, of, their, works, nevertheless, subsequent, generations, of, radical, critics, celebrated, gogol, the, author, in, whose, world, a, nose, roams, the, streets, of, the, russian, capital, as, a, great, realist, a, reputation, decried, by, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, as, the, triumph, of, gogolesque, irony, the, period, of, literary, modernism, saw, a, revival, of, interest, in, and, a, change, of, attitude, towards, gogol, s, work, one, of, the, pioneering, works, of, russian, formalism, was, eichenbaum, s, reappraisal, of, the, overcoat, in, the, 1920s, a, group, of, russian, short, story, writers, known, as, the, serapion, brothers, placed, gogol, among, their, precursors, and, consciously, sought, to, imitate, his, techniques, the, leading, novelists, of, the, period, notably, yevgeny, zamyatin, and, mikhail, bulgakov, also, admired, gogol, and, followed, in, his, footsteps, in, 1926, vsevolod, meyerhold, staged, the, government, inspector, as, a, comedy, of, the, absurd, situation, revealing, to, his, fascinated, spectators, a, corrupt, world, of, endless, self, deception, in, 1934, andrei, bely, published, the, most, meticulous, study, of, gogol, s, literary, techniques, up, to, that, date, in, which, he, analyzed, the, colours, prevalent, in, gogol, s, work, depending, on, the, period, his, impressionistic, use, of, verbs, the, expressive, discontinuity, of, his, syntax, the, complicated, rhythmical, patterns, of, his, sentences, and, many, other, secrets, of, his, craft, based, on, this, work, vladimir, nabokov, published, a, summary, account, of, gogol, s, masterpieces, gogol, s, impact, on, russian, literature, has, endured, yet, various, critics, have, appreciated, his, works, differently, belinsky, for, instance, berated, his, horror, stories, as, moribund, monstrous, works, while, andrei, bely, counted, them, among, his, most, stylistically, daring, creations, nabokov, especially, admired, dead, souls, the, government, inspector, and, the, overcoat, as, works, of, genius, proclaiming, that, when, as, in, his, immortal, the, overcoat, gogol, really, let, himself, go, and, pottered, happily, on, the, brink, of, his, private, abyss, he, became, the, greatest, artist, that, russia, has, yet, produced, critics, traditionally, interpreted, the, overcoat, as, a, masterpiece, of, humanitarian, realism, but, nabokov, and, some, other, attentive, readers, argued, that, holes, in, the, language, make, the, story, susceptible, to, interpretation, as, a, supernatural, tale, about, a, ghostly, double, of, a, small, man, of, all, gogol, s, stories, the, nose, has, stubbornly, defied, all, abstruse, interpretations, d, s, mirsky, declared, it, a, piece, of, sheer, play, almost, sheer, nonsense, in, recent, years, however, the, nose, became, the, subject, of, several, postmodernist, and, postcolonial, interpretations, the, portrayals, of, jewish, characters, in, his, work, have, led, to, gogol, developing, a, reputation, for, antisemitism, due, to, these, portrayals, the, russian, zionist, writer, ze, ev, jabotinsky, condemned, russian, jews, who, participated, in, celebrations, of, gogol, s, centenary, later, critics, have, also, pointed, to, the, apparent, antisemitism, in, his, writings, as, well, as, in, those, of, his, contemporary, fyodor, dostoyevsky, felix, dreizin, and, david, guaspari, for, example, in, their, the, russian, soul, and, the, jew, essays, in, literary, ethnocentrism, discuss, the, significance, of, the, jewish, characters, and, the, negative, image, of, the, ukrainian, jewish, community, in, gogol, s, novel, taras, bulba, pointing, out, gogol, s, attachment, to, anti, jewish, prejudices, prevalent, in, russian, and, ukrainian, culture, in, l, on, poliakov, s, the, history, of, antisemitism, the, author, mentions, that, the, yankel, from, taras, bulba, indeed, became, the, archetypal, jew, in, russian, literature, gogol, painted, him, as, supremely, exploitative, cowardly, and, repulsive, albeit, capable, of, gratitude, but, it, seems, perfectly, natural, in, the, story, that, he, and, his, cohorts, be, drowned, in, the, dniper, by, the, cossack, lords, above, all, yankel, is, ridiculous, and, the, image, of, the, plucked, chicken, that, gogol, used, has, made, the, rounds, of, great, russian, authors, despite, his, portrayal, of, jewish, characters, gogol, left, a, powerful, impression, even, on, jewish, writers, who, inherited, his, literary, legacy, amelia, glaser, has, noted, the, influence, of, gogol, s, literary, innovations, on, sholem, aleichem, who, chose, to, model, much, of, his, writing, and, even, his, appearance, on, gogol, what, sholem, aleichem, was, borrowing, from, gogol, was, a, rural, east, european, landscape, that, may, have, been, dangerous, but, could, unite, readers, through, the, power, of, collective, memory, he, also, learned, from, gogol, to, soften, this, danger, through,
