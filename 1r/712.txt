churchmen, in, the, streams, of, letters, that, addressed, to, me, i, was, pleased, to, read, confessions, in, which, believers, impressed, by, the, achievements, of, science, renounced, god, agreed, that, there, is, no, god, and, everything, connected, with, his, name, is, fiction, and, nonsense, on, 27, march, 1968, while, on, a, routine, training, flight, from, chkalovsky, air, base, gagarin,

conspiracy, theories, at, least, three, investigations, into, the, crash, were, conducted, separately, by, the, air, force, official, government, commissions, and, the, kgb, according, to, a, biography, of, gagarin, by, jamie, doran, and, piers, bizony, starman, the, truth, behind, the, legend, of, yuri, gagarin, the, kgb, worked, not, just, alongside, the, air, force, and, the, official, commission, members, but, against, them, the, kgb, s, report, declassified, in, march, 2003, claimed, that, the, actions, of, airbase, personnel, contributed, to, the, crash, the, report, states, that, an, air, traffic, controller, provided, gagarin, with, outdated, weather, information, and, that, by, the, time, of, his, flight, conditions, had, deteriorated, significantly, ground, crew, also, left, external, fuel, tanks, attached, to, the, aircraft, gagarin, s, planned, flight, activities, needed, clear, weather, and, no, outboard, tanks, the, investigation, concluded, gagarin, s, aircraft, entered, a, spin, either, due, to, a, bird, strike, or, because, of, a, sudden, move, to, avoid, another, aircraft, because, of, the, out, of, date, weather, report, the, crew, believed, their, altitude, was, higher, than, it, was, and, could, not, react, properly, to, bring, the, mig, 15, out, of, its, spin, another, theory, advanced, in, 2005, by, the, original, crash, investigator, hypothesizes, that, a, cabin, air, vent, was, accidentally, left, open, by, the, crew, or, the, previous, pilot, leading, to, oxygen, deprivation, and, leaving, the, crew, incapable, of, controlling, the, aircraft, a, similar, theory, published, in, air, space, smithsonian, magazine, is, that, the, crew, detected, the, open, vent, and, followed, procedure, by, executing, a, rapid, dive, to, a, lower, altitude, this, dive, caused, them, to, lose, consciousness, and, crash, on, 12, april, 2007, the, kremlin, vetoed, a, new, investigation, into, the, death, of, gagarin, government, officials,

the, accident, were, declassified, the, documents, revealed, that, the, commission, s, original, conclusion, was, that, gagarin, or, seryogin, had, manoeuvred, sharply, either, to, avoid, a, weather, balloon, or, to, avoid, entry, into, the, upper, limit, of, the, first, layer, of, cloud, cover, leading, the, jet, into, a, super, critical, flight, regime, and, to, its, stalling, in, complex,

weather, conditions, he, passed, within, 10, or, 20, meters, 33, or, 66, ft, of, yuri, and, seregin, s, plane, while, breaking, the, sound, barrier, the, resulting, turbulence, would, have, sent, the,
