propaganda, she, had, returned, to, anarchist, activism, but, it, was, taking, its, toll, on, her, i, never, felt, so, weighed, down, she, wrote, to, berkman, i, fear, i, am, forever, doomed, to, remain, public, property, and, to, have, my, life, worn, out, through, the, care, for, the, lives, of, others, in, 1906, goldman, decided, to, start, a, publication, a, place, of, expression, for, the, young, idealists, in, arts, and, letters, mother, earth, was, staffed, by, a, cadre, of, radical, activists, including, hippolyte, havel, max, baginski, and, leonard, abbott, in, addition, to,

on, czolgosz, invigorated, anew, by, this, violation, of, freedom, of, assembly, he, declared, my, resurrection, has, come, and, set, about, securing, their, release, berkman, took, the, helm, of, mother, earth, in, 1907, while, goldman, toured, the, country, to, raise, funds, to, keep, it, operating, editing, the, magazine, was, a, revitalizing, experience, for, berkman, but, his, relationship, with, goldman, faltered, and, he, had, an, affair, with, a, 15, year, old, anarchist, named, becky, edelsohn, goldman, was, pained, by, his, rejection, of, her, but, considered, it, a, consequence, of, his, prison, experience, later, that, year, she, served, as, a, delegate, from, the, us, to, the, international, anarchist, congress, of, amsterdam, anarchists, and, syndicalists, from, around, the, world, gathered, to, sort, out, the, tension, between, the, two, ideologies, but, no, decisive, agreement, was, reached, goldman, returned, to, the, us, and, continued, speaking, to, large, audiences, for, the, next, ten, years, goldman, traveled, around, the, country, nonstop, delivering, lectures, and, agitating, for, anarchism, the, coalitions, formed, in, opposition, to, the, anarchist, exclusion, act, had, given, her, an, appreciation, for, reaching, out, to, those, of, other, political, positions, when, the, us, justice, department, sent, spies, to, observe, they, reported, the, meetings, as, packed, writers, journalists, artists, judges, and, workers, from, across, the, spectrum, spoke, of, her, magnetic, power, her, convincing, presence, her, force, eloquence, and, fire, in, the, spring, of, 1908, goldman, met, and, fell, in, love, with, ben, reitman, the, so, called, hobo, doctor, having, grown, up, in, chicago, s, tenderloin, district, reitman,

poverty, and, illness, particularly, venereal, diseases, he, and, goldman, began, an, affair, they, shared, a, commitment, to, free, love, and, reitman, took, a, variety, of, lovers, but, goldman, did, not, she, tried, to, reconcile, her, feelings, of, jealousy, with, a, belief, in, freedom, of, the, heart, but, found, it, difficult, two, years, later, goldman, began, feeling, frustrated, with, lecture, audiences, she, yearned, to, reach, the, few, who, really, want, to, learn, rather, than, the, many, who, come, to, be, amused, she, collected, a, series, of, speeches, and, items, she, had, written, for, mother, earth, and, published, a, book, titled, anarchism, and, other, essays, covering, a, wide, variety, of, topics, goldman, tried, to, represent, the, mental, and, soul, struggles, of, twenty, one, years, when, margaret, sanger, an, advocate, of, access, to, contraception, coined, the, term, birth, control, and, disseminated, information, about, various, methods, in, the, june, 1914, issue, of, her, magazine, the, woman, rebel, she, received, aggressive, support, from, goldman, the, latter, had, already, been, active, in, efforts, to, increase, birth, control, access, for, several, years, in, 1916, goldman, was, arrested, for, giving, lessons, in, public, on, how, to, use, contraceptives, sanger, too, was, arrested, under, the, comstock, law, which, prohibited, the, dissemination, of, obscene, lewd, or, lascivious, articles, which, authorities, defined, as, including, information, relating, to, birth, control, although, they, later, split, from, sanger, over, charges, of, insufficient, support, goldman, and, reitman, distributed, copies, of, sanger, s, pamphlet, family, limitation, along, with, a, similar, essay, of, reitman, s, in, 1915, goldman, conducted, a, nationwide, speaking, tour, in, part, to, raise, awareness, about, contraception, options, although, the, nation, s, attitude, toward, the, topic, seemed, to, be, liberalizing, goldman, was, arrested, on, february, 11, 1916, as, she, was, about, to, give, another, public, lecture, goldman, was, charged, with, violating, the, comstock, law, refusing, to, pay, a, 100, fine, she, spent, two, weeks, in, a, prison, workhouse, which, she, saw, as, an, opportunity, to, reconnect, with, those, rejected, by, society, although, president, woodrow, wilson, was, re, elected, in, 1916, under, the, slogan, he, kept, us, out, of, the, war, at, the, start, of, his, second, term, he, announced, that, germany, s, continued, deployment, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, was, sufficient, cause, for, the, us, to, enter, the, great, war, shortly, afterward, congress, passed, the, selective, service, act, of, 1917, which, required, all, males, aged, 21, 30, to, register, for, military, conscription, goldman, saw, the, decision, as, an, exercise, in, militarist, aggression, driven, by, capitalism, she, declared, in, mother, earth, her, intent, to, resist, conscription, and, to, oppose, us, involvement, in, the, war, to, this, end, she, and, berkman, organized, the, no, conscription, league, of, new, york, which, proclaimed, we, oppose, conscription, because, we, are, internationalists, antimilitarists, and, opposed, to, all, wars, waged, by, capitalistic, governments, the, group, became, a, vanguard, for, anti, draft, activism, and, chapters, began, to, appear, in, other, cities, when, police, began, raiding, the, group, s, public, events, to, find, young, men, who, had, not, registered, for, the, draft, goldman, and, others, focused, their, efforts, on, distributing, pamphlets, and, other, writings, in, the, midst, of, the, nation, s, patriotic, fervor, many, elements, of, the, political, left, refused, to, support, the, league, s, efforts, the, women, s, peace, party, for, example, ceased, its, opposition, to, the, war, once, the, us, entered, it, the, socialist, party, of, america, took, an, official, stance, against, us, involvement, but, supported, wilson, in, most, of, his, activities, on, june, 15, 1917, goldman, and, berkman, were, arrested, during, a, raid, of, their, offices, in, which, authorities, seized, a, wagon, load, of,

during, their, trial, goldman, invoked, the, first, amendment, asking, how, the, government, could, claim, to, fight, for, democracy, abroad, while, suppressing, free, speech, at, home, we, say, that, if, america, has, entered, the, war, to, make, the, world, safe, for, democracy, she, must, first, make, democracy, safe, in, america, how, else, is, the, world, to, take, america, seriously, when, democracy, at, home, is, daily, being, outraged, free, speech, suppressed, peaceable, assemblies, broken, up, by, overbearing, and, brutal, gangsters, in, uniform, when, free, press, is, curtailed, and, every, independent, opinion, gagged, verily, poor, as, we, are, in, democracy, how, can, we, give, of, it, to, the, world, the, jury, found, goldman, and, berkman, guilty, judge, julius,

transported, to, missouri, state, penitentiary, goldman, wrote, to, a, friend, two, years, imprisonment, for, having, made, an, uncompromising, stand, for, one, s, ideal, why, that, is, a, small, price, in, prison, she, was, assigned, to, work, as, a, seamstress, under, the, eye, of, a, miserable, gutter, snipe, of, a, 21, year, old, boy, paid, to, get, results, she, met, the, socialist, kate,

goldman, and, berkman, were, released, from, prison, during, the, united, states, red, scare, of, 1919, 20, when, public, anxiety, about, wartime, pro, german, activities, had, expanded, into, a, pervasive, fear, of, bolshevism, and, the, prospect, of, an, imminent, radical, revolution, it, was, a, time, of, social, unrest, due, to, union, organizing, strikes, and, actions, by, activist,

berkman, hoover, wrote, while, they, were, in, prison, are, beyond, doubt, two, of, the, most, dangerous, anarchists, in, this, country, and, return, to, the, community, will, result, in, undue, harm, at, her, deportation, hearing, on, october, 27, 1919, goldman, refused, to, answer, questions, about, her, beliefs, on, the, grounds, that, her, american, citizenship, invalidated, any, attempt, to, deport, her, under, the, anarchist, exclusion, act, which, could, be, enforced, only, against, non, citizens, of, the, us, she, presented, a, written, statement, instead, today, so, called, aliens,

upon, arrival, in, finland, authorities, there, conducted, the, deportees, to, the, russian, frontier, under, a, flag, of, truce, goldman, initially, viewed, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, a, positive, light, she, wrote, in, mother, earth, that, despite, its, dependence, on, communist, government, it, represented, the, most, fundamental, far, reaching, and, all, embracing, principles, of, human, freedom, and, of, economic, well, being, by, the, time, she, neared, europe, she, expressed, fears, about, what, was, to, come, she, was, worried, about, the, ongoing, russian, civil, war, and, the, possibility, of, being, seized, by, anti, bolshevik, forces, the, state, anti, capitalist, though, it, was, also, posed, a, threat, i, could, never, in, my, life, work, within, the, confines, of, the, state, she, wrote, to, her, niece, bolshevist, or, otherwise, she, quickly, discovered, that, her, fears, were, justified, days, after, returning, to, petrograd, saint, petersburg, she, was, shocked, to, hear, a, party, official, refer, to, free, speech, as, a, bourgeois, superstition, as, she, and, berkman, traveled, around, the, country, they, found, repression, mismanagement, and, corruption, instead, of, the, equality, and, worker, empowerment, they, had, dreamed, of, those, who, questioned, the, government, were, demonized, as, counter, revolutionaries, and, workers, labored, under, severe, conditions, they, met, with, vladimir, lenin, who, assured, them, that, government, suppression, of, press, liberties, was, justified, he, told, them, there, can, be, no, free, speech, in, a, revolutionary, period, berkman, was, more, willing, to, forgive, the, government, s, actions, in, the, name, of, historical, necessity, but, he, eventually, joined, goldman, in, opposing, the, soviet, state, s, authority, in, march, 1921, strikes, erupted, in, petrograd, when, workers, took, to, the, streets, demanding, better, food, rations, and, more, union, autonomy, goldman, and, berkman, felt, a, responsibility, to, support, the, strikers, stating, to, remain, silent, now, is, impossible, even, criminal, the, unrest, spread, to, the, port, town, of, kronstadt, where, the, government, ordered, a, military, response, to, suppress, striking, soldiers, and, sailors, in, the, kronstadt, rebellion, approximately, 1, 000, rebelling, sailors, and, soldiers, were, killed, and, two, thousand, more, were, arrested, many, were, later, executed, in, the, wake, of, these, events, goldman, and, berkman, decided, there, was, no, future, in, the, country, for, them, more, and, more, she, wrote, we, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, we, can, do, nothing, here, and, as, we, can, not, keep, up, a, life, of, inactivity, much, longer, we, have, decided, to, leave, in, december, 1921, they, left, the, country, and, went, to, the, latvian, capital, city, of, riga, the, us, commissioner, in, that, city, wired, officials, in, washington, dc, who, began, requesting, information, from, other, governments, about, the, couple, s, activities, after, a, short, trip, to, stockholm, they, moved, to, berlin, for, several, years, during, this, time, goldman, agreed, to, write, a, series, of, articles, about, her, time, in, russia, for, joseph, pulitzer, s, newspaper, the, new, york, world, these, were, later, collected, and, published, in, book, form, as, my, disillusionment, in, russia, 1923, and, my, further, disillusionment, in, russia, 1924, the, publishers, added, these, titles, to, attract, attention, goldman, protested, albeit, in, vain, goldman, found, it, difficult, to, acclimate, to, the, german, leftist, community, in, berlin, communists, despised, her, outspokenness, about, soviet, repression, liberals, derided, her, radicalism, while, berkman, remained, in, berlin, helping, russian, exiles, goldman, moved, to, london, in, september, 1924, upon, her, arrival, the, novelist, rebecca, west, arranged, a, reception, dinner, for, her, attended, by, philosopher, bertrand, russell, novelist, h, g, wells, and, more, than, 200, other, guests, when, she, spoke, of, her, dissatisfaction, with, the, soviet, government, the, audience, was, shocked, some, left, the, gathering, others, berated, her, for, prematurely, criticizing, the, communist, experiment, later, in, a, letter, russell, declined, to, support, her, efforts, at, systemic, change, in, the, soviet, union, and, ridiculed, her, anarchist, idealism, in, 1925, the, spectre, of, deportation, loomed, again, but, james, colton, a, scottish, anarchist, goldman, had, first, met, in, glasgow, whilst, on, a, speaking, tour, in, 1895, had, offered, to, marry, her, and, provide, british, citizenship, although, they, were, only, distant, acquaintances, she, accepted, and, they, were, married, on, june, 27, 1925, goldman, s, 58th, birthday, her, new, status, gave, her, peace, of, mind, and, allowed, her, to, travel, to, france, and, canada, the, pair, sporadically, exchanged, correspondence, until, colton, s, death, in, 1936, life, in, london, was, stressful, for, goldman, she, wrote, to, berkman, i, am, awfully, tired, and, so, lonely, and, heartsick, it, is, a, dreadful, feeling, to, come, back, here, from, lectures, and, find, not, a, kindred, soul, no, one, who, cares, whether, one, is, dead, or, alive, she, worked, on, analytical, studies, of, drama, expanding, on, the, work, she, had, published, in, 1914, but, the, audiences, were, awful, and, she, never, finished, her, second, book, on, the, subject, goldman, traveled, to, canada, in, 1927, just, in, time, to, receive, news, of, the, impending, executions, of, italian, anarchists, nicola, sacco, and, bartolomeo, vanzetti, in, boston, angered, by, the, many, irregularities, of, the, case, she, saw, it, as, another, travesty, of, justice, in, the, us, she, longed, to, join, the, mass, demonstrations, in, boston, memories, of, the, haymarket, affair, overwhelmed, her, compounded, by, her, isolation, then, she, wrote, i, had, my, life, before, me, to, take, up, the, cause, for, those, killed, now, i, have, nothing, in, 1928, she, began, writing, her, autobiography, with, the, support, of, a, group, of, american, admirers, including, journalist, h, l, mencken, poet, edna, st, vincent, millay, novelist, theodore, dreiser, and, art, collector, peggy, guggenheim, who, raised, 4, 000, for, her, she, secured, a, cottage, in, the, french, coastal, city, of, saint, tropez, and, spent, two, years, recounting, her, life, berkman, offered, sharply, critical, feedback, which, she, eventually, incorporated, at, the, price, of, a, strain, on, their, relationship, goldman, intended, the, book, living, my, life, as, a, single, volume, for, a, price, the, working, class, could, afford, she, urged, no, more, than, 5, 00, her, publisher, alfred, a, knopf, released, it, as, two, volumes, sold, together, for, 7, 50, goldman, was, furious, but, unable, to, force, a, change, due, in, large, part, to, the, great, depression, sales, were, sluggish, despite, keen, interest, from, libraries, around, the, us, critical, reviews, were, generally, enthusiastic, the, new, york, times, the, new, yorker, and, saturday, review, of, literature, all, listed, it, as, one, of, the, year, s, top, non, fiction, books, in, 1933, goldman, received, permission, to, lecture, in, the, united, states, under, the, condition, that, she, speak, only, about, drama, and, her, autobiography, but, not, current, political, events, she, returned, to, new, york, on, february, 2, 1934, to, generally, positive, press, coverage, except, from, communist, publications, soon, she, was, surrounded, by, admirers, and, friends, besieged, with, invitations, to, talks, and, interviews, her, visa, expired, in, may, and, she, went, to, toronto, in, order, to, file, another, request, to, visit, the, us, this, second, attempt, was, denied, she, stayed, in, canada, writing, articles, for, us, publications, in, february, and, march, 1936, berkman, underwent, a, pair, of, prostate, gland, operations, recuperating, in, nice, and, cared, for, by, his, companion, emmy, eckstein, he, missed, goldman, s, sixty, seventh, birthday, in, saint, tropez, in, june, she, wrote, in, sadness, but, he, never, read, the, letter, she, received, a, call, in, the, middle, of, the, night, that, berkman, was, in, great, distress, she, left, for, nice, immediately, but, when, she, arrived, that, morning, goldman, found, that, he, had, shot, himself, and, was, in, a, nearly, comatose, paralysis, he, died, later, that, evening, in, july, 1936, the, spanish, civil, war, started, after, an, attempted, coup, d, tat, by, parts, of, the, spanish, army, against, the, government, of, the, second, spanish, republic, at, the, same, time, the, spanish, anarchists, fighting, against, the, nationalist, forces, started, an, anarchist, revolution, goldman, was, invited, to, barcelona, and, in, an, instant, as, she, wrote, to, her, niece, the, crushing, weight, that, was, pressing, down, on, my, heart, since, sasha, s, death, left, me, as, by, magic, she, was, welcomed, by, the, confederaci, n, nacional, del, trabajo, cnt, and, federaci, n, anarquista, ib, rica, fai, organizations, and, for, the, first, time, in, her, life, lived, in, a, community, run, by, and, for, anarchists, according, to, true, anarchist, principles, in, all, my, life, she, wrote, later, i, have, not, met, with, such, warm, hospitality, comradeship, and, solidarity, after, touring, a, series, of, collectives, in, the, province, of, huesca, she, told, a, group, of, workers, your, revolution, will, destroy, forever, that, anarchism, stands, for, chaos, she, began, editing, the, weekly, cnt, fai, information, bulletin, and, responded, to, english, language, mail, goldman, began, to, worry, about, the, future, of, spain, s, anarchism, when, the, cnt, fai, joined, a, coalition, government, in, 1937, against, the, core, anarchist, principle, of, abstaining, from, state, structures, and, more, distressingly, made, repeated, concessions, to, communist, forces, in, the, name, of, uniting, against, fascism, in, november, 1936, she, wrote, that, cooperating, with, communists, in, spain, was, a, denial, of, our, comrades, in, stalin, s, concentration, camps, the, ussr, meanwhile, refused, to, send, weapons, to, anarchist, forces, and, disinformation, campaigns, were, being, waged, against, the, anarchists, across, europe, and, the, us, her, faith, in, the, movement, unshaken, goldman, returned, to, london, as, an, official, representative, of, the, cnt, fai, delivering, lectures, and, giving, interviews, goldman, enthusiastically, supported, the, spanish, anarcho, syndicalists, she, wrote, regularly, for, spain, and, the, world, a, biweekly, newspaper, focusing, on, the, civil, war, in, may, 1937, communist, led, forces, attacked, anarchist, strongholds, and, broke, up, agrarian, collectives, newspapers, in, england, and, elsewhere, accepted, the, timeline, of, events, offered, by, the, second, spanish, republic, at, face, value, british, journalist, george, orwell, present, for, the, crackdown, wrote, he, accounts, of, the, barcelona, riots, in, may, beat, everything, i, have, ever, seen, for, lying, goldman, returned, to, spain, in, september, but, the, cnt, fai, appeared, to, her, like, people, in, a, burning, house, worse, anarchists, and, other, radicals, around, the, world, refused, to, support, their, cause, the, nationalist, forces, declared, victory, in, spain, just, before, she, returned, to, london, frustrated, by, england, s, repressive, atmosphere, which, she, called, more, fascist, than, the, fascists, she, returned, to, canada, in, 1939, her, service, to, the, anarchist, cause, in, spain, was, not, forgotten, on, her, seventieth, birthday, the, former, secretary, general, of, the, cnt, mariano, r, v, zquez, sent, a, message, to, her, from, paris, praising, her, for, her, contributions, and, naming, her, as, our, spiritual, mother, she, called, it, the, most, beautiful, tribute, i, have, ever, received, as, the, events, preceding, world, war, ii, began, to, unfold, in, europe, goldman, reiterated, her, opposition, to, wars, waged, by, governments, uch, as, i, loathe, hitler, mussolini, stalin, and, franco, she, wrote, to, a, friend, i, would, not, support, a, war, against, them, and, for, the, democracies, which, in, the, last, analysis, are, only, fascist, in, disguise, she, felt, that, britain, and, france, had, missed, their, opportunity, to, oppose, fascism, and, that, the, coming, war, would, only, result, in, a, new, form, of, madness, in, the, world, on, saturday, february, 17, 1940, goldman, suffered, a, debilitating, stroke, she, became, paralyzed, on, her, right, side, and, although, her, hearing, was, unaffected, she, could, not, speak, as, one, friend, described, it, just, to, think, that, here, was, emma, the, greatest, orator, in, america, unable, to, utter, one, word, for, three, months, she, improved, slightly, receiving, visitors, and, on, one, occasion, gesturing, to, her, address, book, to, signal, that, a, friend, might, find, friendly, contacts, during, a, trip, to, mexico, she, suffered, another, stroke, on, may, 8, and, she, died, six, days, later, in, toronto, aged, 70, the, us, immigration, and, naturalization, service, allowed, her, body, to, be, brought, back, to, the, united, states, she, was, buried, in, german, waldheim, cemetery, now, named, forest, home, cemetery, in, forest, park, illinois, a, western, suburb, of, chicago, near, the, graves, of, those, executed, after, the, haymarket, affair, the, bas, relief, on, her, grave, marker, was, created, by, sculptor, jo, davidson, and, the, stone, includes, the, quote, liberty, will, not, descend, to, a, people, a, people, must, raise, themselves, to, liberty, goldman, spoke, and, wrote, extensively, on, a, wide, variety, of, issues, while, she, rejected, orthodoxy, and, fundamentalist, thinking, she, was, an, important, contributor, to, several, fields, of, modern, political, philosophy, she, was, influenced, by, many, diverse, thinkers, and, writers, including, mikhail, bakunin, henry, david, thoreau, peter, kropotkin, ralph, waldo, emerson, nikolai, chernyshevsky, and, mary, wollstonecraft, another, philosopher, who, influenced, goldman, was, friedrich, nietzsche, in, her, autobiography, she, wrote, nietzsche, was, not, a, social, theorist, but, a, poet, a, rebel, and, innovator, his, aristocracy, was, neither, of, birth, nor, of, purse, it, was, the, spirit, in, that, respect, nietzsche, was, an, anarchist, and, all, true, anarchists, were, aristocrats, anarchism, was, central, to, goldman, s, view, of, the, world, and, she, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, important, figures, in, the, history, of, anarchism, and, libertarian, socialism, first, drawn, to, it, during, the, persecution, of, anarchists, after, the, 1886, haymarket, affair, she, wrote, and, spoke, regularly, on, behalf, of, anarchism, in, the, title, essay, of, her, book, anarchism, and, other, essays, she, wrote, anarchism, then, really, stands, for, the, liberation, of, the, human, mind, from, the, dominion, of, religion, the, liberation, of, the, human, body, from, the, dominion, of, property, liberation, from, the, shackles, and, restraint, of, government, anarchism, stands, for, a, social, order, based, on, the, free, grouping, of, individuals, for, the, purpose, of, producing, real, social, wealth, an, order, that, will, guarantee, to, every, human, being, free, access, to, the, earth, and, full, enjoyment, of, the, necessities, of, life, according, to, individual, desires, tastes, and, inclinations, goldman, s, anarchism, was, intensely, personal, she, believed, it, was, necessary, for, anarchist, thinkers, to, live, their, beliefs, demonstrating, their, convictions, with, every, action, and, word, i, don, t, care, if, a, man, s, theory, for, tomorrow, is, correct, she, once, wrote, i, care, if, his, spirit, of, today, is, correct, anarchism, and, free, association, were, to, her, logical, responses, to, the, confines, of, government, control, and, capitalism, it, seems, to, me, that, these, are, the, new, forms, of, life, she, wrote, and, that, they, will, take, the, place, of, the, old, not, by, preaching, or, voting, but, by, living, them, at, the, same, time, she, believed, that, the, movement, on, behalf, of, human, liberty, must, be, staffed, by, liberated, humans, while, dancing, among, fellow, anarchists, one, evening, she, was, chided, by, an, associate, for, her, carefree, demeanor, in, her, autobiography, goldman, wrote, i, told, him, to, mind, his, own, business, i, was, tired, of, having, the, cause, constantly, thrown, in, my, face, i, did, not, believe, that, a, cause, which, stood, for, a, beautiful, ideal, for, anarchism, for, release, and, freedom, from, conventions, and, prejudice, should, demand, denial, of, life, and, joy, i, insisted, that, our, cause, could, not, expect, me, to, behave, as, a, nun, and, that, the, movement, should, not, be, turned, into, a, cloister, if, it, meant, that, i, did, not, want, it, i, want, freedom, the, right, to, self, expression, everybody, s, right, to, beautiful, radiant, things, goldman, in, her, political, youth, held, targeted, violence, to, be, a, legitimate, means, of, revolutionary, struggle, goldman, at, the, time, believed, that, the, use, of, violence, while, distasteful, could, be, justified, in, relation, to, the, social, benefits, it, might, accrue, she, advocated, propaganda, of, the, deed, attentat, or, violence, carried, out, to, encourage, the, masses, to, revolt, she, supported, her, partner, alexander, berkman, s, attempt, to, kill, industrialist, henry, clay, frick, and, even, begged, him, to, allow, her, to, participate, she, believed, that, frick, s, actions, during, the, homestead, strike, were, reprehensible, and, that, his, murder, would, produce, a, positive, result, for, working, people, yes, she, wrote, later, in, her, autobiography, the, end, in, this, case, justified, the, means, while, she, never, gave, explicit, approval, of, leon, czolgosz, s, assassination, of, us, president, william, mckinley, she, defended, his, ideals, and, believed, actions, like, his, were, a, natural, consequence, of, repressive, institutions, as, she, wrote, in, the, psychology, of, political, violence, the, accumulated, forces, in, our, social, and, economic, life, culminating, in, an, act, of, violence, are, similar, to, the, terrors, of, the, atmosphere, manifested, in, storm, and, lightning, her, experiences, in, russia, led, her, to, qualify, her, earlier, belief, that, revolutionary, ends, might, justify, violent, means, in, the, afterword, to, my, disillusionment, in, russia, she, wrote, there, is, no, greater, fallacy, than, the, belief, that, aims, and, purposes, are, one, thing, while, methods, and, tactics, are, another, the, means, employed, become, through, individual, habit, and, social, practice, part, and, parcel, of, the, final, purpose, in, the, same, chapter, goldman, affirmed, that, revolution, is, indeed, a, violent, process, and, noted, that, violence, was, the, tragic, inevitability, of, revolutionary, upheavals, some, misinterpreted, her, comments, on, the, bolshevik, terror, as, a, rejection, of, all, militant, force, but, goldman, corrected, this, in, the, preface, to, the, first, us, edition, of, my, disillusionment, in, russia, the, argument, that, destruction, and, terror, are, part, of, revolution, i, do, not, dispute, i, know, that, in, the, past, every, great, political, and, social, change, necessitated, violence, black, slavery, might, still, be, a, legalized, institution, in, the, united, states, but, for, the, militant, spirit, of, the, john, browns, i, have, never, denied, that, violence, is, inevitable, nor, do, i, gainsay, it, now, yet, it, is, one, thing, to, employ, violence, in, combat, as, a, means, of, defense, it, is, quite, another, thing, to, make, a, principle, of, terrorism, to, institutionalize, it, to, assign, it, the, most, vital, place, in, the, social, struggle, such, terrorism, begets, counter, revolution, and, in, turn, itself, becomes, counter, revolutionary, goldman, saw, the, militarization, of, soviet, society, not, as, a, result, of, armed, resistance, per, se, but, of, the, statist, vision, of, the, bolsheviks, writing, that, an, insignificant, minority, bent, on, creating, an, absolute, state, is, necessarily, driven, to, oppression, and, terrorism, goldman, believed, that, the, economic, system, of, capitalism, was, incompatible, with, human, liberty, the, only, demand, that, property, recognizes, she, wrote, in, anarchism, and, other, essays, is, its, own, gluttonous, appetite, for, greater, wealth, because, wealth, means, power, the, power, to, subdue, to, crush, to, exploit, the, power, to, enslave, to, outrage, to, degrade, she, also, argued, that, capitalism, dehumanized, workers, turning, the, producer, into, a, mere, particle, of, a, machine, with, less, will, and, decision, than, his, master, of, steel, and, iron, originally, opposed, to, anything, less, than, complete, revolution, goldman, was, challenged, during, one, talk, by, an, elderly, worker, in, the, front, row, in, her, autobiography, she, wrote, he, said, that, he, understood, my, impatience, with, such, small, demands, as, a, few, hours, less, a, day, or, a, few, dollars, more, a, week, but, what, were, men, of, his, age, to, do, they, were, not, likely, to, live, to, see, the, ultimate, overthrow, of, the, capitalist, system, were, they, also, to, forgo, the, release, of, perhaps, two, hours, a, day, from, the, hated, work, that, was, all, they, could, hope, to, see, realized, in, their, lifetime, goldman, viewed, the, state, as, essentially, and, inevitably, a, tool, of, control, and, domination, as, a, result, of, her, anti, state, views, goldman, believed, that, voting, was, useless, at, best, and, dangerous, at, worst, voting, she, wrote, provided, an, illusion, of, participation, while, masking, the, true, structures, of, decision, making, instead, goldman, advocated, targeted, resistance, in, the, form, of, strikes, protests, and, direct, action, against, the, invasive, meddlesome, authority, of, our, moral, code, she, maintained, an, anti, voting, position, even, when, many, anarcho, syndicalists, in, 1930s, spain, voted, for, the, formation, of, a, liberal, republic, goldman, wrote, that, any, power, anarchists, wielded, as, a, voting, bloc, should, instead, be, used, to, strike, across, the, country, she, disagreed, with, the, movement, for, women, s, suffrage, which, demanded, the, right, of, women, to, vote, in, her, essay, woman, suffrage, she, ridicules, the, idea, that, women, s, involvement, would, infuse, the, democratic, state, with, a, more, just, orientation, as, if, women, have, not, sold, their, votes, as, if, women, politicians, cannot, be, bought, she, agreed, with, the, suffragists, assertion, that, women, are, equal, to, men, but, disagreed, that, their, participation, alone, would, make, the, state, more, just, to, assume, therefore, that, she, would, succeed, in, purifying, something, which, is, not, susceptible, of, purification, is, to, credit, her, with, supernatural, powers, goldman, was, also, critical, of, zionism, which, she, saw, as, another, failed, experiment, in, state, control, goldman, was, also, a, passionate, critic, of, the, prison, system, critiquing, both, the, treatment, of, prisoners, and, the, social, causes, of, crime, goldman, viewed, crime, as, a, natural, outgrowth, of, an, unjust, economic, system, and, in, her, essay, prisons, a, social, crime, and, failure, she, quoted, liberally, from, the, 19th, century, authors, fyodor, dostoevsky, and, oscar, wilde, on, prisons, and, wrote, year, after, year, the, gates, of, prison, hells, return, to, the, world, an, emaciated, deformed, will, less, shipwrecked, crew, of, humanity, with, the, cain, mark, on, their, foreheads, their, hopes, crushed, all, their, natural, inclinations, thwarted, with, nothing, but, hunger, and, inhumanity, to, greet, them, these, victims, soon, sink, back, into, crime, as, the, only, possibility, of, existence, goldman, was, a, committed, war, resister, and, was, particularly, opposed, to, the, draft, viewing, it, as, one, of, the, worst, of, the, state, s, forms, of, coercion, and, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, no, conscription, league, for, which, she, was, ultimately, arrested, and, imprisoned, in, 1917, before, being, deported, in, 1919, goldman, was, routinely, surveilled, arrested, and, imprisoned, for, her, speech, and, organizing, activities, in, support, of, workers, and, various, strikes, access, to, birth, control, and, in, opposition, to, world, war, i, as, a, result, she, became, active, in, the, early, 20th, century, free, speech, movement, seeing, freedom, of, expression, as, a, fundamental, necessity, for, achieving, social, change, her, outspoken, championship, of, her, ideals, in, the, face, of, persistent, arrests, inspired, roger, baldwin, one, of, the, founders, of, the, american, civil, liberties, union, goldman, s, and, reitman, s, experiences, with, vigilantism, in, the, san, diego, free, speech, fight, in, 1912, is, an, example, of, their, persistence, in, the, fight, for, free, speech, despite, risking, their, safety, although, she, was, hostile, to, the, suffragist, goals, of, first, wave, feminism, goldman, advocated, passionately, for, the, rights, of, women, and, is, today, heralded, as, a, founder, of, anarcha, feminism, which, challenges, patriarchy, as, a, hierarchy, to, be, resisted, alongside, state, power, and, class, divisions, in, 1897, she, wrote, i, demand, the, independence, of, woman, her, right, to, support, herself, to, live, for, herself, to, love, whomever, she, pleases, or, as, many, as, she, pleases, i, demand, freedom, for, both, sexes, freedom, of, action, freedom, in, love, and, freedom, in, motherhood, a, nurse, by, training, goldman, was, an, early, advocate, for, educating, women, concerning, contraception, like, many, feminists, of, her, time, she, saw, abortion, as, a, tragic, consequence, of, social, conditions, and, birth, control, as, a, positive, alternative, goldman, was, also, an, advocate, of, free, love, and, a, strong, critic, of, marriage, she, saw, early, feminists, as, confined, in, their, scope, and, bounded, by, social, forces, of, puritanism, and, capitalism, she, wrote, we, are, in, need, of, unhampered, growth, out, of, old, traditions, and, habits, the, movement, for, women, s, emancipation, has, so, far, made, but, the, first, step, in, that, direction, goldman, was, also, an, outspoken, critic, of, prejudice, against, homosexual, and, genderqueer, people, her, belief, that, social, liberation, should, extend, to, gay, men, and, lesbians, was, virtually, unheard, of, at, the, time, even, among, anarchists, as, german, sexologist, magnus, hirschfeld, wrote, she, was, the, first, and, only, woman, indeed, the, first, and, only, american, to, take, up, the, defense, of, homosexual, love, before, the, general, public, in, numerous, speeches, and, letters, she, defended, the, right, of, gay, men, and, lesbians, to, love, as, they, pleased, and, condemned, the, fear, and, stigma, associated, with, homosexuality, as, goldman, wrote, in, a, letter, to, hirschfeld, it, is, a, tragedy, i, feel, that, people, of, a, different, sexual, type, are, caught, in, a, world, which, shows, so, little, understanding, for, homosexuals, and, is, so, crassly, indifferent, to, the, various, gradations, and, variations, of, gender, and, their, great, significance, in, life, a, committed, atheist, goldman, viewed, religion, as, another, instrument, of, control, and, domination, her, essay, the, philosophy, of, atheism, quoted, bakunin, at, length, on, the, subject, and, added, consciously, or, unconsciously, most, theists, see, in, gods, and, devils, heaven, and, hell, reward, and, punishment, a, whip, to, lash, the, people, into, obedience, meekness, and, contentment, the, philosophy, of, atheism, expresses, the, expansion, and, growth, of, the, human, mind, the, philosophy, of, theism, if, we, can, call, it, a, philosophy, is, static, and, fixed, in, essays, like, the, hypocrisy, of, puritanism, and, a, speech, entitled, the, failure, of, christianity, goldman, made, more, than, a, few, enemies, among, religious, communities, by, attacking, their, moralistic, attitudes, and, efforts, to, control, human, behavior, she, blamed, christianity, for, the, perpetuation, of, a, slave, society, arguing, that, it, dictated, individuals, actions, on, earth, and, offered, poor, people, a, false, promise, of, a, plentiful, future, in, heaven, goldman, was, well, known, during, her, life, described, as, among, other, things, the, most, dangerous, woman, in, america, after, her, death, and, through, the, middle, part, of, the, 20th, century, her, fame, faded, scholars, and, historians, of, anarchism, viewed, her, as, a, great, speaker, and, activist, but, did, not, regard, her, as, a, philosophical, or, theoretical, thinker, on, par, with, for, example, kropotkin, in, 1970, dover, press, reissued, goldman, s, biography, living, my, life, and, in, 1972, feminist, writer, alix, kates, shulman, issued, a, collection, of, goldman, s, writing, and, speeches, red, emma, speaks, these, works, brought, goldman, s, life, and, writings, to, a, larger, audience, and, she, was, in, particular, lionized, by, the, women, s, movement, of, the, late, 20th, century, in, 1973, shulman, was, asked, by, a, printer, friend, for, a, quotation, by, goldman, for, use, on, a, t, shirt, she, sent, him, the, selection, from, living, my, life, about, the, right, to, self, expression, everybody, s, right, to, beautiful, radiant, things, recounting, that, she, had, been, admonished, that, it, did, not, behoove, an, agitator, to, dance, the, printer, created, a, statement, based, on, these, sentiments, that, has, become, one, of, the, most, famous, quotations, attributed, to, goldman, even, though, she, probably, never, said, or, wrote, it, as, such, if, i, can, t, dance, i, don, t, want, to, be, in, your, revolution, variations, of, this, saying, have, appeared, on, thousands, of, t, shirts, buttons, posters, bumper, stickers, coffee, mugs, hats, and, other, items, the, women, s, movement, of, the, 1970s, that, rediscovered, goldman, was, accompanied, by, a, resurgent, anarchist, movement, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, which, also, reinvigorated, scholarly, attention, to, earlier, anarchists, the, growth, of, feminism, also, initiated, some, reevaluation, of, goldman, s, philosophical, work, with, scholars, pointing, out, the, significance, of, goldman, s, contributions, to, anarchist, thought, in, her, time, goldman, s, belief, in, the, value, of, aesthetics, for, example, can, be, seen, in, the, later, influences, of, anarchism, and, the, arts, similarly, goldman, is, now, given, credit, for, significantly, influencing, and, broadening, the, scope, of, activism, on, issues, of, sexual, liberty, reproductive, rights, and, freedom, of, expression, goldman, has, been, depicted, in, numerous, works, of, fiction, over, the, years, including, warren, beatty, s, 1981, film, reds, in, which, she, was, portrayed, by, maureen, stapleton, who, won, an, academy, award, for, her, performance, goldman, has, also, been, a, character, in, two, broadway, musicals, ragtime, and, assassins, plays, depicting, goldman, s, life, include, howard, zinn, s, play, emma, martin, duberman, s, mother, earth, jessica, litwak, s, emma, goldman, love, anarchy, and, other, affairs, about, goldman, s, relationship, with, berkman, and, her, arrest, in, connection, with, mckinley, s, assassination, lynn, rogoff, s, love, ben, love, emma, about, goldman, s, relationship, with, reitman, carol, bolt, s, red, emma, and, alexis, roblan, s, red, emma, and, the, mad, monk, ethel, mannin, s, 1941, novel, red, rose, is, also, based, on, goldman, s, life, goldman, has, been, honored, by, a, number, of, organizations, named, in, her, memory, the, emma, goldman, clinic, a, women, s, health, center, located, in, iowa, city, iowa, selected, goldman, as, a, namesake, in, recognition, of, her, challenging, spirit, red, emma, s, bookstore, coffeehouse, an, infoshop, in, baltimore, maryland, adopted, her, name, out, of, their, belief, in, the, ideas, and, ideals, that, she, fought, for, her, entire, life, free, speech, sexual, and, racial, equality, and, independence, the, right, to, organize, in, our, jobs, and, in, our, own, lives, ideas, and, ideals, that, we, continue, to, fight, for, even, today, goldman, was, a, prolific, writer, penning, countless, pamphlets, and, articles, on, a, diverse, range, of, subjects, she, authored, six, books, including, an, autobiography, living, my, life, and, a, biography, of, fellow, anarchist, voltairine, de, cleyre, digital, collections, physical, collections
