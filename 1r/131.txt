and, sculpture, the, intense, colourism, of, the, works, he, painted, between, 1900, and, 1905, brought, him, notoriety, as, one, of, the, fauves, french, for, wild, beasts, many, of, his, finest, works, were, created, in, the, decade, or, so, after, 1906, when, he, developed, a, rigorous, style, that, emphasized, flattened, forms, and, decorative, pattern, in, 1917, he, relocated, to, a, suburb, of, nice, on, the, french, riviera, and, the, more, relaxed, style, of, his, work, during, the, 1920s, gained, him, critical, acclaim, as, an, upholder, of, the, classical, tradition, in,

nicolas, poussin, and, antoine, watteau, as, well, as, by, modern, artists, such, as, douard, manet, and, by, japanese, art, chardin, was, one, of, the, painters, matisse, most, admired, as, an, art,

home, included, a, plaster, bust, by, rodin, a, painting, by, gauguin, a, drawing, by, van, gogh, and, c, zanne, s, three, bathers, in, c, zanne, s, sense, of, pictorial, structure, and, colour, matisse, found, his, main, inspiration, many, of, matisse, s, paintings, from, 1898, to, 1901, make, use, of, a, divisionist, technique, he, adopted, after, reading, paul, signac, s, essay, d, eug, ne, delacroix, au, n, o, impressionisme, in, may, 1902, am, lie, s, parents, became, ensnared, in, a, major, financial, scandal, the, humbert, affair, her, mother, who, was, the, humbert, family, s, housekeeper, and, father, became, scapegoats, in, the, scandal, and, her, family, was, menaced, by, angry, mobs, of, fraud, victims, according, to, art, historian, hilary, spurling, their, public, exposure, followed, by, the, arrest, of, his, father, in, law, left, matisse, as, the, sole, breadwinner, for, an, extended, family, of, seven, during, 1902, to, 1903, matisse, adopted, a, style, of, painting, that, was, comparatively, somber, and, concerned, with, form, a, change, possibly, intended, to, produce, saleable, works, during, this, time, of, material, hardship, having, made, his, first, attempt, at, sculpture, a, copy, after, antoine, louis, barye, in, 1899, he, devoted, much, of, his, energy, to, working, in, clay, completing, the, slave, in, 1903, fauvism, as, a, style, began, around, 1900, and, continued, beyond, 1910, the, movement, as, such, lasted, only, a, few, years, 1904, 1908, and, had, three, exhibitions, the, leaders, of, the, movement, were, matisse, and, andr, derain, matisse, s, first, solo, exhibition, was, at, ambroise, vollard, s, gallery, in, 1904, without, much, success, his, fondness, for, bright, and, expressive, colour, became, more, pronounced, after, he, spent, the, summer, of, 1904, painting, in, st, tropez, with, the, neo, impressionists, signac, and, henri, edmond, cross, in, that, year, he, painted, the, most, important, of, his, works, in, the, neo, impressionist, style, luxe, calme, et, volupt, in, 1905, he, travelled, southwards, again, to, work, with, andr, derain, at, collioure, his, paintings, of, this, period, are, characterised, by, flat, shapes, and, controlled, lines, using, pointillism, in, a, less, rigorous, way, than, before, matisse, and, a, group, of, artists, now, known, as, fauves, exhibited, together, in, a, room, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, 1905, the, paintings, expressed, emotion, with, wild, often, dissonant, colours, without, regard, for, the, subject, s, natural, colours, matisse, showed, open, window, and, woman, with, the, hat, at, the, salon, critic, louis, vauxcelles, commented, on, a, lone, sculpture, surrounded, by, an, orgy, of, pure, tones, as, donatello, chez, les, fauves, donatello, among, the, wild, beasts, referring, to, a, renaissance, type, sculpture, that, shared, the, room, with, them, his, comment, was, printed, on, 17, october, 1905, in, gil, blas, a, daily, newspaper, and, passed, into, popular, usage, the, exhibition, garnered, harsh, criticism, a, pot, of, paint, has, been, flung, in, the, face, of, the, public, said, the, critic, camille, mauclair, but, also, some, favourable, attention, when, the, painting, that, was, singled, out, for, special, condemnation, matisse, s, woman, with, a, hat, was, bought, by, gertrude, and, leo, stein, the, embattled, artist, s, morale, improved, considerably, matisse, was, recognised, as, a, leader, of, the, fauves, along, with, andr, derain, the, two, were, friendly, rivals, each, with, his, own, followers, other, members, were, georges, braque, raoul, dufy, and, maurice, de, vlaminck, the, symbolist, painter, gustave, moreau, 1826, 1898, was, the, movement, s, inspirational, teacher, as, a, professor, at, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, paris, he, pushed, his, students, to, think, outside, of, the, lines, of, formality, and, to, follow, their, visions, in, 1907, guillaume, apollinaire, commenting, about, matisse, in, an, article, published, in, la, falange, wrote, we, are, not, here, in, the, presence, of, an, extravagant, or, an, extremist, undertaking, matisse, s, art, is, eminently, reasonable, but, matisse, s, work, of, the, time, also, encountered, vehement, criticism, and, it, was, difficult, for, him, to, provide, for, his, family, his, painting, nu, bleu, 1907, was, burned, in, effigy, at, the, armory, show, in, chicago, in, 1913, the, decline, of, the, fauvist, movement, after, 1906, did, not, affect, the, career, of, matisse, many, of, his, finest, works, were, created, between, 1906, and, 1917, when, he, was, an, active, part, of, the, great, gathering, of, artistic, talent, in, montparnasse, even, though, he, did, not, quite, fit, in, with, his, conservative, appearance, and, strict, bourgeois, work, habits, he, continued, to, absorb, new, influences, he, travelled, to, algeria, in, 1906, studying, african, art, and, primitivism, after, viewing, a, large, exhibition, of, islamic, art, in, munich, in, 1910, he, spent, two, months, in, spain, studying, moorish, art, he, visited, morocco, in, 1912, and, again, in, 1913, and, while, painting, in, tangier, he, made, several, changes, to, his, work, including, his, use, of, black, as, a, colour, the, effect, on, matisse, s, art, was, a, new, boldness, in, the, use, of, intense, unmodulated, colour, as, in, l, atelier, rouge, 1911, matisse, had, a, long, association, with, the, russian, art, collector, sergei, shchukin, he, created, one, of, his, major, works, la, danse, specially, for, shchukin, as, part, of, a, two, painting, commission, the, other, painting, being, music, 1910, an, earlier, version, of, la, danse, 1909, is, in, the, collection, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, around, april, 1906, matisse, met, pablo, picasso, who, was, 11, years, his, junior, the, two, became, lifelong, friends, as, well, as, rivals, and, are, often, compared, one, key, difference, between, them, is, that, matisse, drew, and, painted, from, nature, while, picasso, was, more, inclined, to, work, from, imagination, the, subjects, painted, most, frequently, by, both, artists, were, women, and, still, lifes, with, matisse, more, likely, to, place, his, figures, in, fully, realised, interiors, matisse, and, picasso, were, first, brought, together, at, the, paris, salon, of, gertrude, stein, with, her, partner, alice, b, toklas, during, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, the, americans, in, paris, gertrude, stein, her, brothers, leo, stein, michael, stein, and, michael, s, wife, sarah, were, important, collectors, and, supporters, of, matisse, s, paintings, in, addition, gertrude, stein, s, two, american, friends, from, baltimore, the, cone, sisters, claribel, and, etta, became, major, patrons, of, matisse, and, picasso, collecting, hundreds, of, their, paintings, and, drawings, the, cone, collection, is, now, exhibited, in, the, baltimore, museum, of, art, while, numerous, artists, visited, the, stein, salon, many, of, these, artists, were, not, represented, among, the, paintings, on, the, walls, at, 27, rue, de, fleurus, where, the, works, of, renoir, c, zanne, matisse, and, picasso, dominated, leo, and, gertrude, stein, s, collection, sarah, stein, s, collection, particularly, emphasised, matisse, contemporaries, of, leo, and, gertrude, stein, matisse, and, picasso, became, part, of, their, social, circle, and, routinely, joined, the, gatherings, that, took, place, on, saturday, evenings, at, 27, rue, de, fleurus, gertrude, attributed, the, beginnings, of, the, saturday, evening, salons, to, matisse, remarking, more, and, more, frequently, people, began, visiting, to, see, the, matisse, paintings, and, the, c, zannes, matisse, brought, people, everybody, brought, somebody, and, they, came, at, any, time, and, it, began, to, be, a, nuisance, and, it, was, in, this, way, that, saturday, evenings, began, among, pablo, picasso, s, acquaintances, who, also, frequented, the, saturday, evenings, were, fernande, olivier, picasso, s, mistress, georges, braque, andr, derain, the, poets, max, jacob, and, guillaume, apollinaire, marie, laurencin, apollinaire, s, mistress, and, an, artist, in, her, own, right, and, henri, rousseau, his, friends, organized, and, financed, the, acad, mie, matisse, in, paris, a, private, and, non, commercial, school, in, which, matisse, instructed, young, artists, it, operated, from, 1907, until, 1911, the, initiative, for, the, academy, came, from, the, steins, and, the, d, miers, with, the, involvement, of, hans, purrmann, patrick, henry, bruce, and, sarah, stein, matisse, spent, seven, months, in, morocco, from, 1912, to, 1913, producing, about, 24, paintings, and, numerous, drawings, his, frequent, orientalist, topics, of, later, paintings, such, as, odalisques, can, be, traced, to, this, period, goldfish, in, aquariums, also, became, a, frequently, recurring, theme, in, matisse, s, art, following, his, trip, to, morocco, in, 1917, matisse, relocated, to, cimiez, on, the, french, riviera, a, suburb, of, the, city, of, nice, his, work, of, the, decade, or, so, following, this, relocation, shows, a, relaxation, and, softening, of, his, approach, this, return, to, order, is, characteristic, of, much, post, world, war, i, art, and, can, be, compared, with, the, neoclassicism, of, picasso, and, stravinsky, as, well, as, the, return, to, traditionalism, of, derain, matisse, s, orientalist, odalisque, paintings, are, characteristic, of, the, period, while, this, work, was, popular, some, contemporary, critics, found, it, shallow, and, decorative, in, the, late, 1920s, matisse, once, again, engaged, in, active, collaborations, with, other, artists, he, worked, with, not, only, frenchmen, dutch, germans, and, spaniards, but, also, a, few, americans, and, recent, american, immigrants, after, 1930, a, new, vigor, and, bolder, simplification, appeared, in, his, work, american, art, collector, albert, c, barnes, convinced, matisse, to, produce, a, large, mural, for, the, barnes, foundation, the, dance, ii, which, was, completed, in, 1932, the, foundation, owns, several, dozen, other, matisse, paintings, this, move, toward, simplification, and, a, foreshadowing, of, the, cut, out, technique, is, also, evident, in, his, painting, large, reclining, nude, 1935, matisse, worked, on, this, painting, for, several, months, and, documented, the, progress, with, a, series, of, 22, photographs, which, he, sent, to, etta, cone, matisse, s, wife, am, lie, who, suspected, that, he, was, having, an, affair, with, her, young, russian, emigre, companion, lydia, delectorskaya, ended, their, 41, year, marriage, in, july, 1939, dividing, their, possessions, equally, between, them, delectorskaya, attempted, suicide, by, shooting, herself, in, the, chest, remarkably, she, survived, with, no, serious, after, effects, and, returned, to, matisse, and, worked, with, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, running, his, household, paying, the, bills, typing, his, correspondence, keeping, meticulous, records, assisting, in, the, studio, and, coordinating, his, business, affairs, matisse, was, visiting, paris, when, the, nazis, invaded, france, in, june, 1940, but, managed, to, make, his, way, back, to, nice, his, son, pierre, by, then, a, gallery, owner, in, new, york, begged, him, to, flee, while, he, could, matisse, was, about, to, depart, for, brazil, to, escape, the, occupation, of, france, but, changed, his, mind, and, remained, in, nice, in, vichy, france, it, seemed, to, me, as, if, i, would, be, deserting, he, wrote, pierre, in, september, 1940, if, everyone, who, has, any, value, leaves, france, what, remains, of, france, although, he, was, never, a, member, of, the, resistance, it, became, a, point, of, pride, to, the, occupied, french, that, one, of, their, most, acclaimed, artists, chose, to, stay, while, the, nazis, occupied, france, from, 1940, to, 1944, they, were, more, lenient, in, their, attacks, on, degenerate, art, in, paris, than, they, were, in, the, german, speaking, nations, under, their, military, dictatorship, matisse, was, allowed, to, exhibit, along, with, other, former, fauves, and, cubists, whom, hitler, had, initially, claimed, to, despise, though, without, any, jewish, artists, all, of, whose, works, had, been, purged, from, all, french, museums, and, galleries, any, french, artists, exhibiting, in, france, had, to, sign, an, oath, assuring, their, aryan, status, including, matisse, he, also, worked, as, a, graphic, artist, and, produced, black, and, white, illustrations, for, several, books, and, over, one, hundred, original, lithographs, at, the, mourlot, studios, in, paris, in, 1941, matisse, was, diagnosed, with, duodenal, cancer, the, surgery, while, successful, resulted, in, serious, complications, from, which, he, nearly, died, being, bedridden, for, three, months, resulted, in, his, developing, a, new, art, form, using, paper, and, scissors, that, same, year, a, nursing, student, named, monique, bourgeois, responded, to, an, advertisement, placed, by, matisse, for, a, nurse, a, platonic, friendship, developed, between, matisse, and, bourgeois, he, discovered, that, she, was, an, amateur, artist, and, taught, her, about, perspective, after, bourgeois, left, the, position, to, join, a, convent, in, 1944, matisse, sometimes, contacted, her, to, request, that, she, model, for, him, bourgeois, became, a, dominican, nun, in, 1946, and, matisse, painted, a, chapel, in, vence, a, small, town, he, moved, to, in, 1943, in, her, honor, matisse, remained, for, the, most, part, isolated, in, southern, france, throughout, the, war, but, his, family, was, intimately, involved, with, the, french, resistance, his, son, pierre, the, art, dealer, in, new, york, helped, the, jewish, and, anti, nazi, french, artists, he, represented, to, escape, occupied, france, and, enter, the, united, states, in, 1942, pierre, held, an, exhibition, in, new, york, artists, in, exile, which, was, to, become, legendary, matisse, s, estranged, wife, am, lie, was, a, typist, for, the, french, underground, and, jailed, for, six, months, matisse, was, shocked, when, he, heard, that, his, daughter, marguerite, who, had, been, active, in, the, r, sistance, during, the, war, was, tortured, almost, to, death, by, the, gestapo, in, a, rennes, prison, and, sentenced, to, the, ravensbr, ck, concentration, camp, in, germany, marguerite, managed, to, escape, from, the, train, to, ravensbr, ck, which, was, halted, during, an, allied, air, raid, she, survived, in, the, woods, in, the, chaos, of, the, closing, days, of, the, war, until, rescued, by, fellow, resisters, matisse, s, student, rudolf, levy, was, killed, in, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, in, 1944, diagnosed, with, abdominal, cancer, in, 1941, matisse, underwent, surgery, that, left, him, reliant, on, a, wheelchair, and, often, bedbound, painting, and, sculpture, had, become, physical, challenges, so, he, turned, to, a, new, type, of, medium, with, the, help, of, his, assistants, he, began, creating, cut, paper, collages, or, decoupage, he, would, cut, sheets, of, paper, pre, painted, with, gouache, by, his, assistants, into, shapes, of, varying, colours, and, sizes, and, arrange, them, to, form, lively, compositions, initially, these, pieces, were, modest, in, size, but, eventually, transformed, into, murals, or, room, sized, works, the, result, was, a, distinct, and, dimensional, complexity, an, art, form, that, was, not, quite, painting, but, not, quite, sculpture, he, called, the, last, fourteen, years, of, his, life, une, seconde, vie, meaning, his, second, life, when, talking, about, his, work, matisse, mentioned, that, while, his, mobility, was, limited, he, could, wander, through, gardens, in, the, form, of, his, artwork, although, the, paper, cut, out, was, matisse, s, major, medium, in, the, final, decade, of, his, life, his, first, recorded, use, of, the, technique, was, in, 1919, during, the, design, of, decor, for, the, le, chant, du, rossignol, an, opera, composed, by, igor, stravinsky, albert, c, barnes, arranged, for, cardboard, templates, to, be, made, of, the, unusual, dimensions, of, the, walls, onto, which, matisse, in, his, studio, in, nice, fixed, the, composition, of, painted, paper, shapes, another, group, of, cut, outs, were, made, between, 1937, and, 1938, while, matisse, was, working, on, the, stage, sets, and, costumes, for, sergei, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, however, it, was, only, after, his, operation, that, bedridden, matisse, began, to, develop, the, cut, out, technique, as, its, own, form, rather, than, its, prior, utilitarian, origin, he, moved, to, the, hilltop, of, vence, france, in, 1943, where, he, produced, his, first, major, cut, out, project, for, his, artist, s, book, titled, jazz, however, these, cut, outs, were, conceived, as, designs, for, stencil, prints, to, be, looked, at, in, the, book, rather, than, as, independent, pictorial, works, at, this, point, matisse, still, thought, of, the, cut, outs, as, separate, from, his, principal, art, form, his, new, understanding, of, this, medium, unfolds, with, the, 1946, introduction, for, jazz, after, summarizing, his, career, matisse, refers, to, the, possibilities, the, cut, out, technique, offers, insisting, an, artist, must, never, be, a, prisoner, of, himself, prisoner, of, a, style, prisoner, of, a, reputation, prisoner, of, success, the, number, of, independently, conceived, cut, outs, steadily, increased, following, jazz, and, eventually, led, to, the, creation, of, mural, size, works, such, as, oceania, the, sky, and, oceania, the, sea, of, 1946, under, matisse, s, direction, lydia, delectorskaya, his, studio, assistant, loosely, pinned, the, silhouettes, of, birds, fish, and, marine, vegetation, directly, onto, the, walls, of, the, room, the, two, oceania, pieces, his, first, cut, outs, of, this, scale, evoked, a, trip, to, tahiti, he, made, years, before, in, may, 1954, his, cut, out, the, sheaf, was, exhibited, at, the, salon, de, mai, and, met, with, success, the, artwork, was, a, commission, for, american, collectors, mr, and, mrs, brody, and, the, cut, out, was, then, adapted, to, a, ceramic, for, their, house, in, los, angeles, it, is, now, located, in, the, los, angeles, county, museum, of, art, in, 1948, matisse, began, to, prepare, designs, for, the, chapelle, du, rosaire, de, vence, which, allowed, him, to, expand, this, technique, within, a, truly, decorative, context, the, experience, of, designing, the, chapel, windows, chasubles, and, tabernacle, door, all, planned, using, the, cut, out, method, had, the, effect, of, consolidating, the, medium, as, his, primary, focus, finishing, his, last, painting, in, 1951, and, final, sculpture, the, year, before, matisse, utilized, the, paper, cut, out, as, his, sole, medium, for, expression, up, until, his, death, this, project, was, the, result, of, the, close, friendship, between, matisse, and, bourgeois, now, sister, jacques, marie, despite, him, being, an, atheist, they, had, met, again, in, vence, and, started, the, collaboration, a, story, related, in, her, 1992, book, henri, matisse, la, chapelle, de, vence, and, in, the, 2003, documentary, a, model, for, matisse, in, 1952, he, established, a, museum,
