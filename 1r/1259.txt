szlachta, while, his, pro, french, stance, in, politics, alienated, some, his, military, victories, against, invading, tatars, in, 1671, helped, him, gain, other, allies, the, year, 1672, saw, internal, politics, destabilizing, the, commonwealth, as, the, pro, french, faction, of, sobieski, and, pro, court, faction, of, king, micha, formed, two, confederations, which, despite, major, ottoman, incursions, in, the, south, seemed, more, concerned, with, one, another, than, with, uniting, to, defend, the, country, the, court, faction, called, openly, for, confiscation, of, his, estates, and, dismissal, from, office, and, declared, him, an, enemy, of, the, state, this, division, culminated, in, the, humiliating, treaty, of, buchach, where, the, commonwealth, was, forced, to, cede, territories, to, the, ottomans, but, promise, an, annual, tribute, sobieski, eventually, succeeded, in, balancing, politics, and, national, defense, and, a, combination, of, his, military, victories, over, the, invaders, and, successful, negotiations, at, the, sejm, in, april, 1673, led, to, a, compromise, in, which, the, court, faction, dropped, its, demands, and, challenges, against, him, in, the, year, 1672, the, polish, lithuanian, tatars, rose, up, in, open, rebellion, against, the, commonwealth, this, was, the, widely, remembered, lipka, rebellion, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, sobieski, who, was, held, in, great, esteem, by, the, tatar, soldiers, many, of, the, lipkas, seeking, asylum, and, service, in, the, ottoman, army, returned, to, his, command, on, 11, november, 1673, sobieski, added, a, major, victory, to, his, list, this, time, defeating, the, ottomans, in, the, battle, of, khotyn, and, capturing, the, fortress, located, there, the, news, of, the, battle, coincided, with, the, death, of, king, michal, the, day, before, the, battle, this, made, sobieski, one, of, the, leading, figures, of, the, state, so, on, 19, may, the, following, year, he, was, elected, monarch, of, the, commonwealth, his, candidacy, was, almost, universally, supported, with, only, a, dozen, or, so, members, of, the, diet, opposing, him, mainly, centered, around, magnates, of, the, lithuanian, pac, family, in, light, of, the, war, requiring, sobieski, to, be, on, the, front, lines, the, coronation, ceremony, was, significantly, delayed, he, was, crowned, john, iii, almost, two, years, later, on, 2, february, 1676, though, poland, lithuania, was, at, that, time, the, largest, and, one, of, the, most, populous, states, of, europe, sobieski, became, a, king, of, a, country, devastated, by, almost, half, a, century, of, constant, war, the, treasury, was, almost, empty, and, the, court, had, little, to, offer, the, powerful, magnates, who, often, allied, themselves, with, foreign, courts, rather, than, the, state, sobieski, had, a, number, of, long, term, plans, including, establishing, his, own, dynasty, in, the, commonwealth, regaining, lost, territories, and, strengthening, the, country, through, various, reforms, one, of, his, ambitions, was, to, unify, christian, europe, in, a, crusade, to, drive, the, turks, out, of, europe, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, however, the, polish, state, was, in, dire, fiscal, straits, and, faced, military, threats, to, the, north, king, louis, xiv, of, france, promised, to, mediate, a, truce, between, the, ottomans, and, poland, so, that, sobieski, could, focus, his, attentions, on, prussia, the, negotiations, ended, in, failure, and, sobieski, s, baltic, goals, had, to, be, tempered, by, the, immediate, reality, of, the, ottoman, threat, to, the, south, in, the, autumn, of, 1674, he, recommenced, the, war, against, the, ottomans, and, managed, to, recapture, a, number, of, cities, and, fortresses, including, bratslav, mogilev, and, bar, which, re, established, a, strongly, fortified, line, defending, poland, s, southern, border, in, ukraine, in, 1675, sobieski, defeated, a, turkish, and, tatar, offensive, aiming, at, lviv, in, 1676, the, tatars, began, a, counter, offensive, and, crossed, the, dneper, but, could, not, retake, the, strategic, town, of, rawno, and, a, peace, treaty, the, treaty, of, urawno, was, signed, soon, afterwards, although, kamieniec, podolski, and, much, of, podolia, remained, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, poland, gained, the, return, of, the, towns, of, bila, tserkva, and, pavoloch, the, treaty, with, the, ottomans, began, a, period, of, peace, that, was, much, needed, for, the, repair, of, the, country, and, strengthening, of, the, royal, authority, sobieski, managed, to, reform, the, polish, army, completely, the, army, was, reorganised, into, regiments, the, infantry, finally, dropped, pikes, replacing, them, with, battle, axes, and, the, polish, cavalry, adopted, hussar, and, dragoon, formations, sobieski, also, greatly, increased, the, number, of, cannon, and, introduced, new, artillery, tactics, sobieski, wanted, to, conquer, prussia, with, swedish, troops, and, french, support, regaining, control, of, this, autonomous, province, was, in, the, commonwealth, s, best, interest, and, sobieski, also, hoped, for, it, to, become, part, of, his, family, domain, to, this, end, he, made, the, secret, treaty, of, jawor, w, 1675, but, he, achieved, nothing, the, wars, with, the, ottoman, empire, were, not, decisively, won, by, the, commonwealth, the, ruler, of, brandenburg, prussia, made, treaties, with, france, prussia, defeated, the, swedish, invasion, and, sobieski, s, plans, for, the, commonwealth, s, own, military, campaign, against, prussia, was, opposed, by, commonwealth, magnates, many, of, them, taking, the, prussian, side, backed, by, brandenburg, and, austria, internal, enemies, of, sobieski, even, planned, to, dethrone, him, and, elect, charles, of, lorraine, the, french, prussian, treaty, of, 1679, meant, that, sobieski, lost, the, major, foreign, ally, for, his, planned, campaign, against, prussia, consequently, he, started, to, distance, himself, from, the, pro, french, faction, which, in, turn, resulted, in, the, cooling, down, of, the, polish, french, relations, during, the, sejm, of, 1683, the, french, ambassador, was, expelled, for, involvement, with, a, plan, to, dethrone, sobieski, which, definitely, marked, the, end, of, the, polish, french, alliance, at, the, same, time, sobieski, made, peace, with, the, pro, habsburg, faction, and, started, to, gravitate, towards, an, alliance, with, austria, this, did, not, end, the, existence, of, strong, internal, opposition, to, sobieski, however, it, changed, a, number, of, allegiances, and, further, opposition, was, temporarily, weakened, through, the, king, s, successful, political, maneuvering, including, granting, the, grand, hetman, office, to, one, of, the, opposition, s, chief, leaders, stanis, aw, jan, jab, onowski, conscious, that, poland, lacked, allies, and, risked, war, against, most, of, its, neighbours, a, situation, similar, to, the, deluge, sobieski, allied, himself, by, 1683, with, leopold, i, of, the, holy, roman, empire, both, sides, promised, to, come, to, one, s, another, aid, if, their, capitals, were, threatened, the, alliance, was, signed, by, royal, representatives, on, 31, march, 1683, and, ratified, by, the, emperor, and, polish, parliament, within, weeks, although, aimed, directly, against, the, ottomans, and, indirectly, against, france, it, had, the, advantage, of, gaining, internal, support, for, the, defense, of, poland, s, southern, borders, this, was, a, beginning, of, what, would, become, the, holy, league, championed, by, pope, innocent, xi, to, preserve, christendom, meantime, in, the, spring, of, 1683, royal, spies, uncovered, ottoman, preparations, for, a, military, campaign, sobieski, feared, that, the, target, might, be, the, polish, cities, of, lw, w, and, krak, w, to, counteract, the, threat, sobieski, began, the, fortification, of, the, cities, and, ordered, universal, military, conscription, in, july, the, austrian, envoy, asked, for, polish, assistance, soon, afterward, the, polish, army, started, massing, for, an, expedition, against, the, ottomans, and, in, august, was, joined, by, bavarians, and, saxon, allies, under, charles, of, lorraine, sobieski, s, greatest, success, came, in, 1683, with, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, vienna, in, joint, command, of, polish, and, german, troops, against, the, invading, ottomans, under, kara, mustafa, upon, reaching, vienna, on, 12, september, with, the, ottoman, army, close, to, breaching, the, walls, sobieski, ordered, a, full, attack, in, the, early, morning, the, united, army, of, about, 65, 000, 76, 000, men, including, 22, 000, 27, 000, poles, attacked, a, turkish, force, of, about, 143, 000, men, at, about, 5, 00, pm, after, observing, the, infantry, battle, from, the, kahlenberg, hilltop, sobieski, led, the, polish, husaria, cavalry, along, with, austrians, and, germans, in, a, massive, charge, down, the, hillside, soon, the, ottoman, battle, line, was, broken, and, the, ottoman, forces, scattered, in, disarray, at, 5, 30, pm, sobieski, entered, the, deserted, tent, of, kara, mustafa, and, the, battle, of, vienna, ended, the, pope, and, other, foreign, dignitaries, hailed, sobieski, as, the, savior, of, vienna, and, western, european, civilization, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, he, wrote, all, the, common, people, kissed, my, hands, my, feet, my, clothes, others, only, touched, me, saying, ah, let, us, kiss, so, valiant, a, hand, the, war, against, the, ottomans, was, not, yet, over, and, sobieski, continued, the, campaign, with, the, battle, of, p, rk, ny, on, 7, 9, october, after, early, victories, the, polish, found, themselves, a, junior, partner, in, the, holy, league, gaining, no, lasting, territorial, or, political, rewards, the, prolonged, and, indecisive, war, also, weakened, sobieski, s, position, at, home, for, the, next, four, years, poland, would, blockade, the, key, fortress, at, kamenets, and, ottoman, tatars, would, raid, the, borderlands, in, 1691, sobieski, undertook, another, expedition, to, moldavia, with, slightly, better, results, but, still, with, no, decisive, victories, although, the, king, spent, much, time, on, the, battlefields, which, could, suggest, a, good, state, of, health, towards, the, end, of, his, life, he, became, seriously, and, increasingly, ill, king, john, iii, sobieski, died, in, wilan, w, poland, on, 17, june, 1696, from, a, sudden, heart, attack, his, wife, marie, casimire, louise, died, in, 1716, in, blois, france, and, her, body, was, returned, to, poland, they, are, interred, together, in, wawel, cathedral, krak, w, although, his, heart, is, interred, separately, in, the, church, of, the, transfiguration, in, warsaw, poland, he, was, succeeded, by, augustus, ii, sobieski, is, remembered, in, poland, as, a, hero, king, victor, at, vienna, who, defeated, the, ottoman, threat, an, image, that, became, particularly, well, recognized, after, his, story, was, told, in, many, works, of, 19th, century, literature, in, the, polish, biographical, dictionary, he, is, described, as, an, individual, above, his, contemporaries, but, still, one, of, them, an, oligarch, and, a, magnate, interested, in, personal, wealth, and, power, his, ambitions, for, the, most, part, were, instilled, in, him, by, his, beloved, wife, whom, he, undoubtedly, loved, more, than, any, throne, when, being, forced, to, divorce, her, and, marry, the, former, queen, as, a, condition, to, gain, the, throne, he, immediately, refused, the, throne, and, tended, to, obey, at, times, blindly, he, failed, to, reform, the, ailing, commonwealth, and, to, secure, the, throne, for, his, heir, at, the, same, time, he, displayed, high, military, prowess, he, was, well, educated, and, literate, and, a, patron, of, science, and, arts, he, supported, the, astronomer, johannes, hevelius, mathematician, adam, adamandy, kocha, ski, and, the, historian, and, poet, wespazjan, kochowski, his, wilan, w, palace, became, the, first, of, many, palaces, that, would, dot, the, lands, of, the, commonwealth, over, the, next, two, centuries, on, 5, july, 1665, he, married, the, widow, of, jan, sobiepan, zamoyski, marie, casimire, louise, de, la, grange, d, arquien, 1641, 1716, of, nevers, burgundy, france, their, children, were, when, he, turned, to, go, back, to, the, camp, he, discovered, that, there, was, another, man, up, on, this, hill, a, stone, s, throw, away, some, kind, of, monk, or, holy, man, perhaps, as, he, was, dressed, in, a, rough, sackcloth, robe, with, no, finery, but, then, the, bloke, whipped, out, a, sword, it, was, not, one, of, your, needle, thin, rapiers, such, as, fops, pushed, at, each, other, in, the, streets, of, london, and, paris, but, some, kind, of, relic, of, the, crusades, a, two, handed, production, with, a, single, crossbar, instead, of, a, proper, guard, the, sort, of, thing, richard, the, lionhearted, might, ve, used, to, slay, camels, in, the, streets, of, jerusalem, this, man, went, down, on, one, knee, in, the, dirt, and, he, did, it, with, verve, and, enthusiasm, you, see, your, rich, man, kneeling, in, church, and, it, takes, him, two, or, three, minutes, you, can, hear, his, knees, popping, and, sinews, creaking, he, totters, this, way, and, that, creating, small, alarums, amongst, the, servants, who, are, gripping, his, elbows, but, this, brute, knelt, easily, even, lustily, if, such, a, thing, were, possible, and, facing, toward, the, city, of, vienna, he, planted, his, sword, in, the, ground, so, that, it, became, a, steel, cross, the, morning, light, was, shining, directly, into, his, grizzled, face, and, glinting, from, the, steel, of, the, blade, and, glowing, in, some, indifferent, colored, jewels, set, into, the, weapon, s, hilt, and, crossbar, the, man, bowed, his, head, and, took, to, mumbling, in, latin, the, hand, that, wasn, t, holding, the, sword, was, thumbing, through, a, rosary, jack, s, cue, to, exit, stage, right, but, as, he, was, leaving, he, recognized, the, man, with, the, broadsword, as, king, john, sobieski
