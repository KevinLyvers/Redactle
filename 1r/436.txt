of, japanese, literature, specifically, the, japanese, movement, descended, from, naturalism, while, it, also, stood, in, opposition, to, the, workers, or, proletarian, literature, movement, of, the,

kawabata, and, yokomitsu, used, to, describe, their, philosophy, has, often, been, mistakenly, translated, into, english, as, neo, impressionism, however, shinkankakuha, was, not, meant, to, be, an, updated, or, restored, version, of, impressionism, it, focused, on, offering, new, impressions, or, more, accurately, new, sensations, or, new, perceptions, in, the, writing, of, literature, an, early, example, from, this, period, is, the, draft, of, hoshi, wo, nusunda, chichi, the, father, who, stole, a, star, an, adaption, of, ferenc, moln, r, s, play, liliom, kawabata, started, to,

who, on, a, walking, trip, down, izu, peninsula, meets, a, young, dancer, and, returns, to, tokyo, in, much, improved, spirits, the, work, explores, the, dawning, eroticism, of, young, love, but, includes, shades, of, melancholy, and, even, bitterness, which, offset, what, might, have, otherwise, been, an, overly, sweet, story, most, of, his, subsequent, works, explored, similar, themes, in, the, 1920s, kawabata, was, living, in, the, plebeian, district, of, asakusa, tokyo, during, this, period, kawabata, experimented, with, different, styles, of, writing, in, asakusa, kurenaidan, the, scarlet, gang, of, asakusa, serialized, from, 1929, to, 1930, he, explores, the, lives, of, the, demimonde, and, others, on, the, fringe, of, society, in, a, style, echoing, that, of, late, edo, period, literature, on, the, other, hand, his, suisho, genso, crystal, fantasy, is, pure, stream, of, consciousness, writing, he, was, even, involved, in, writing, the, script, for, the, experimental, film, a, page, of, madness, kawabata, met, his, wife, hideko, n, e, matsubayashi, in, 1925, and, they, registered, their, marriage, on, 2, december, 1931, in, 1933, kawabata, protested, publicly,

kanagawa, prefecture, in, 1934, and, although, he, initially, enjoyed, a, very, active, social, life, among, the, many, other, writers, and, literary, people, residing, in, that, city, during, the, war, years, and, immediately, thereafter, in, his, later, years, he, became, very, reclusive, one, of, his, most, famous, novels, was, snow, country, started, in, 1934, and, first, published, in, installments, from, 1935, through, 1937, snow, country, is, a, stark, tale, of, a, love, affair, between, a, tokyo, dilettante, and, a, provincial, geisha, which, takes, place, in, a, remote, hot, spring, town, somewhere, in, the, mountainous, regions, of, northern, japan, it, established, kawabata, as, one, of, japan, s, foremost, authors, and, became, an, instant, classic, described, by, edward, g, seidensticker, as, perhaps, kawabata, s, masterpiece, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, kawabata, s, success, continued, with, novels, such, as, thousand, cranes, a, story, of, ill, fated, love, the, sound, of, the, mountain, the, house, of, the, sleeping, beauties, beauty, and, sadness, and, the, old, capital, thousand, cranes, serialized, 1949, 1951, is, centered, on, the, japanese, tea, ceremony, and, hopeless, love, the, protagonist, is, attracted, to, the, mistress, of, his, dead, father, and, after, her, death, to, her, daughter, who, flees, from, him, the, tea, ceremony, provides, a, beautiful, background, for, ugly, human, affairs, but, kawabata, s, intent, is, rather, to, explore, feelings, about, death, the, tea, ceremony, utensils, are, permanent, and, forever, whereas, people, are, frail, and, fleeting, these, themes, of, impossible, love, and, impending, death, are, again, explored, in, the, sound, of, the, mountain, serialized, 1949, 1954, set, in, kawabata, s, adopted, home, of, kamakura, the, protagonist, an, aging, man, has, become, disappointed, with, his, children, and, no, longer, feels, strong, passion, for, his, wife, he, is, strongly, attracted, to, someone, forbidden, his, daughter, in, law, and, his, thoughts, for, her, are, interspersed, with, memories, of, another, forbidden, love, for, his, dead, sister, in, law, the, book, that, kawabata, himself, considered, his, finest, work, the, master, of, go, 1951, contrasts, sharply, with, his, other, works, it, is, a, semi, fictional, recounting, of, a, major, go, match, in, 1938, on, which, he, had, actually, reported, for, the, mainichi, newspaper, chain, it, was, the, last, game, of, master, sh, sai, s, career, and, he, lost, to, his, younger, challenger, minoru, kitani, only, to, die, a, little, over, a, year, later, although, the, novel, is, moving, on, the, surface, as, a, retelling, of, a, climactic, struggle, some, readers, consider, it, a, symbolic, parallel, to, the, defeat, of, japan, in, world, war, ii, through, many, of, kawabata, s, works, the, sense, of, distance, in, his, life, is, represented, he, often, gives, the, impression, that, his, characters, have, built, up, a, wall, around, them, that, moves, them, into, isolation, in, a, 1934, published, work, kawabata, wrote, i, feel, as, though, i, have, never, held, a, woman, s, hand, in, a, romantic, sense, am, i, a, happy, man, deserving, of, pity, indeed, this, does, not, have, to, be, taken, literally, but, it, does, show, the, type, of, emotional, insecurity, that, kawabata, felt, especially, experiencing, two, painful, love, affairs, at, a, young, age, kawabata, left, many, of, his, stories, apparently, unfinished, sometimes, to, the, annoyance, of, readers, and, reviewers, but, this, goes, hand, to, hand, with, his, aesthetics, of, art, for, art, s, sake, leaving, outside, any, sentimentalism, or, morality, that, an, ending, would, give, to, any, book, this, was, done, intentionally, as, kawabata, felt, that, vignettes, of, incidents, along, the, way, were, far, more, important, than, conclusions, he, equated, his, form, of, writing, with, the, traditional, poetry, of, japan, the, haiku, in, addition, to, fictional, writing, kawabata, also, worked, as, a, reporter, most, notably, for, the, mainichi, shimbun, although, he, refused, to, participate, in, the, militaristic, fervor, that, accompanied, world, war, ii, he, also, demonstrated, little, interest, in, postwar, political, reforms, along, with, the, death, of, all, his, family, members, while, he, was, young, kawabata, suggested, that, the, war, was, one, of, the, greatest, influences, on, his, work, stating, he, would, be, able, to, write, only, elegies, in, postwar, japan, still, many, commentators, detect, little, thematic, change, between, kawabata, s, prewar, and, postwar, writings, as, the, president, of, japanese, p, e, n, for, many, years, after, the, war, 1948, 1965, kawabata, was, a, driving, force, behind, the, translation, of, japanese, literature, into, english, and, other, western, languages, he, was, awarded, the, goethe, plaque, of, the, city, of, frankfurt, in, 1959, appointed, an, officer, of, the, order, of, arts, and, letters, of, france, in, 1960, and, awarded, japan, s, order, of, culture, the, following, year, in, 1969, kawabata, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, by, the, university, of, hawai, i, kawabata, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, on, 16, october, 1968, the, first, japanese, person, to, receive, such, a, distinction, in, awarding, the, prize, for, his, narrative, mastery, which, with, great, sensibility, expresses, the, essence, of, the, japanese, mind, the, nobel, committee, cited, three, of, his, novels, snow, country, thousand, cranes, and, the, old, capital, kawabata, s, nobel, lecture, was, titled, japan, the, beautiful, and, myself, zen, buddhism, was, a, key, focal, point, of, the, speech, much, was, devoted, to, practitioners, and, the, general, practices, of, zen, buddhism, and, how, it, differed, from, other, types, of, buddhism, he, presented, a, severe, picture, of, zen, buddhism, where, disciples, can, enter, salvation, only, through, their, efforts, where, they, are, isolated, for, several, hours, at, a, time, and, how, from, this, isolation, there, can, come, beauty, he, noted, that, zen, practices, focus, on, simplicity, and, it, is, this, simplicity, that, proves, to, be, the, beauty, the, heart, of, the, ink, painting, is, in, space, abbreviation, what, is, left, undrawn, from, painting, he, moved, on, to, talk, about, ikebana, and, bonsai, as, art, forms, that, emphasize, the, elegance, and, beauty, that, arises, from, the, simplicity, the, japanese, garden, too, of, course, symbolizes, the, vastness, of, nature, in, addition, to, the, numerous, mentions, of, zen, and, nature, one, topic, that, was, briefly, mentioned, in, kawabata, s, lecture, was, that, of, suicide, kawabata, reminisced, of, other, famous, japanese, authors, who, committed, suicide, in, particular, ry, nosuke, akutagawa, he, contradicted, the, custom, of, suicide, as, being, a, form, of, enlightenment, mentioning, the, priest, ikky, who, also, thought, of, suicide, twice, he, quoted, ikky, among, those, who, give, thoughts, to, things, is, there, one, who, does, not, think, of, suicide, there, was, much, speculation, about, this, quote, being, a, clue, to, kawabata, s, suicide, in, 1972, a, year, and, a, half, after, mishima, had, committed, suicide, kawabata, apparently, committed, suicide, in, 1972, by, gassing, himself, but, several, close, associates, and, friends, including, his, widow, consider, his, death, to, have, been, accidental, one, thesis, as, advanced, by, donald, richie, was, that, he, mistakenly, unplugged, the, gas, tap, while, preparing, a, bath, many, theories, have, been, advanced, as, to, his, potential, reasons, for, killing, himself, among, them, poor, health, the, discovery, he, had, parkinson, s, disease, a, possible, illicit, love, affair, or, the, shock, caused, by, the, suicide, of, his, friend, yukio, mishima, in, 1970, unlike, mishima, kawabata, left, no, note, and, since, again, unlike, mishima, he, had, not, discussed, significantly, in, his, writings, the, topic, of, taking, his, own, life, his, motives, remain, unclear, however, his, japanese, biographer, takeo, okuno, has, related, how, he, had, nightmares, about, mishima, for, two, or, three, hundred, nights, in, a, row, and, was, incessantly, haunted, by, the, specter, of, mishima, in, a, persistently, depressed, state, of, mind, he, would, tell, friends, during, his, last, years, that, sometimes, when, on, a, journey, he, hoped, his, plane, would, crash, kawabata, s, works, have, been, translated, into, languages, such, as, english, french, german, and, turkish, korean, niji, ikutabi
