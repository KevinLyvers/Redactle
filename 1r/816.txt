john, locke, l, k, 29, august, 1632, o, s, 28, october, 1704, o, s, was, an, english, philosopher, and, physician, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, of, enlightenment, thinkers, and, commonly, known, as, the, father, of, liberalism, considered, one, of, the, first, of, the, british, empiricists, following, the, tradition, of, francis, bacon, locke, is, equally, important, to, social, contract, theory, his, work, greatly, affected, the, development, of, epistemology, and, political, philosophy, his, writings, influenced, voltaire, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, many, scottish, enlightenment, thinkers, as, well, as, the, american, revolutionaries, his, contributions, to, classical, republicanism, and, liberal, theory, are, reflected, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, internationally, locke, s, political, legal, principles, continue, to, have, a, profound, influence, on, the, theory, and, practice, of, limited, representative, government, and, the, protection, of, basic, rights, and, freedoms, under, the, rule, of, law, locke, s, theory, of, mind, is, often, cited, as, the, origin, of, modern, conceptions, of, identity, and, the, self, figuring, prominently, in, the, work, of, later, philosophers, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, david, hume, and, immanuel, kant, he, postulated, that, at, birth, the, mind, was, a, blank, slate, or, tabula, rasa, contrary, to, cartesian, philosophy, based, on, pre, existing, concepts, he, maintained, that, we, are, born, without, innate, ideas, and, that, knowledge, is, instead, determined, only, by, experience, derived, from, sense, perception, a, concept, now, known, as, empiricism, locke, is, often, credited, for, describing, private, property, as, a, natural, law, principle, arguing, that, when, a, person, mixes, their, labour, with, nature, the, labour, enters, the, object, conferring, individual, ownership, locke, was, born, on, 29, august, 1632, in, a, small, thatched, cottage, by, the, church, in, wrington, somerset, about, 12, miles, from, bristol, he, was, baptised, the, same, day, as, both, of, his, parents, were, puritans, locke, s, father, also, named, john, was, an, attorney, who, served, as, clerk, to, the, justices, of, the, peace, in, chew, magna, and, as, a, captain, of, cavalry, for, the, parliamentarian, forces, during, the, early, part, of, the, english, civil, war, his, mother, was, agnes, keene, soon, after, locke, s, birth, the, family, moved, to, the, market, town, of, pensford, about, seven, miles, south, of, bristol, where, locke, grew, up, in, a, rural, tudor, house, in, belluton, in, 1647, locke, was, sent, to, the, prestigious, westminster, school, in, london, under, the, sponsorship, of, alexander, popham, a, member, of, parliament, and, john, sr, s, former, commander, at, the, age, of, 16, he, was, at, school, just, half, a, mile, away, from, the, execution, of, charles, i, however, the, boys, were, not, allowed, to, go, and, watch, after, completing, studies, at, westminster, he, was, admitted, to, christ, church, oxford, in, the, autumn, of, 1652, at, the, age, of, 20, the, dean, of, the, college, at, the, time, was, john, owen, vice, chancellor, of, the, university, although, a, capable, student, locke, was, irritated, by, the, undergraduate, curriculum, of, the, time, he, found, the, works, of, modern, philosophers, such, as, ren, descartes, more, interesting, than, the, classical, material, taught, at, the, university, through, his, friend, richard, lower, whom, he, knew, from, the, westminster, school, locke, was, introduced, to, medicine, and, the, experimental, philosophy, being, pursued, at, other, universities, and, in, the, royal, society, of, which, he, eventually, became, a, member, locke, was, awarded, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, february, 1656, and, a, master, s, degree, in, june, 1658, he, obtained, a, bachelor, of, medicine, in, february, 1675, having, studied, the, subject, extensively, during, his, time, at, oxford, and, in, addition, to, lower, worked, with, such, noted, scientists, and, thinkers, as, robert, boyle, thomas, willis, and, robert, hooke, in, 1666, he, met, anthony, ashley, cooper, lord, ashley, who, had, come, to, oxford, seeking, treatment, for, a, liver, infection, ashley, was, impressed, with, locke, and, persuaded, him, to, become, part, of, his, retinue, at, oxford, he, was, exposed, to, the, writings, of, islamic, scholars, like, ibn, tufayl, s, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, translated, by, edward, pococke, who, influenced, his, perspectives, on, philosophy, and, tabula, rasa, locke, had, been, looking, for, a, career, and, in, 1667, moved, into, ashley, s, home, at, exeter, house, in, london, to, serve, as, his, personal, physician, in, london, locke, resumed, his, medical, studies, under, the, tutelage, of, thomas, sydenham, sydenham, had, a, major, effect, on, locke, s, natural, philosophical, thinking, an, effect, that, would, become, evident, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, locke, s, medical, knowledge, was, put, to, the, test, when, ashley, s, liver, infection, became, life, threatening, locke, coordinated, the, advice, of, several, physicians, and, was, probably, instrumental, in, persuading, ashley, to, undergo, surgery, then, life, threatening, in, itself, to, remove, the, cyst, ashley, survived, and, prospered, crediting, locke, with, saving, his, life, during, this, time, locke, served, as, secretary, of, the, board, of, trade, and, plantations, and, secretary, to, the, lords, proprietors, of, carolina, which, helped, to, shape, his, ideas, on, international, trade, and, economics, ashley, as, a, founder, of, the, whig, movement, exerted, great, influence, on, locke, s, political, ideas, locke, became, involved, in, politics, when, ashley, became, lord, chancellor, in, 1672, ashley, being, created, 1st, earl, of, shaftesbury, in, 1673, following, shaftesbury, s, fall, from, favour, in, 1675, locke, spent, some, time, travelling, across, france, as, a, tutor, and, medical, attendant, to, caleb, banks, he, returned, to, england, in, 1679, when, shaftesbury, s, political, fortunes, took, a, brief, positive, turn, around, this, time, most, likely, at, shaftesbury, s, prompting, locke, composed, the, bulk, of, the, two, treatises, of, government, while, it, was, once, thought, that, locke, wrote, the, treatises, to, defend, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, recent, scholarship, has, shown, that, the, work, was, composed, well, before, this, date, the, work, is, now, viewed, as, a, more, general, argument, against, absolute, monarchy, particularly, as, espoused, by, robert, filmer, and, thomas, hobbes, and, for, individual, consent, as, the, basis, of, political, legitimacy, although, locke, was, associated, with, the, influential, whigs, his, ideas, about, natural, rights, and, government, are, today, considered, quite, revolutionary, for, that, period, in, english, history, locke, fled, to, the, netherlands, in, 1683, in, the, company, of, shaftesbury, under, strong, suspicion, of, involvement, in, the, rye, house, plot, although, there, is, little, evidence, to, suggest, that, he, was, directly, involved, in, the, scheme, while, in, the, netherlands, he, lived, under, the, pen, name, dr, van, linden, the, philosopher, and, novelist, rebecca, newberger, goldstein, argues, that, during, his, five, years, in, holland, locke, chose, his, friends, from, among, the, same, freethinking, members, of, dissenting, protestant, groups, as, spinoza, s, small, group, of, loyal, confidants, locke, almost, certainly, met, men, in, amsterdam, who, spoke, of, the, ideas, of, that, renegade, jew, who, insisted, on, identifying, himself, through, his, religion, of, reason, alone, while, she, says, that, locke, s, strong, empiricist, tendencies, would, have, disinclined, him, to, read, a, grandly, metaphysical, work, such, as, spinoza, s, ethics, in, other, ways, he, was, deeply, receptive, to, spinoza, s, ideas, most, particularly, to, the, rationalist, s, well, thought, out, argument, for, political, and, religious, tolerance, and, the, necessity, of, the, separation, of, church, and, state, among, the, friends, he, made, in, the, netherlands, are, van, leeuwenhoek, and, van, limborch, the, leader, of, the, remonstrants, in, the, netherlands, locke, had, time, to, return, to, his, writing, spending, a, great, deal, of, time, working, on, the, essay, concerning, human, understanding, and, composing, the, letter, on, toleration, locke, did, not, return, home, until, after, the, glorious, revolution, locke, accompanied, mary, ii, back, to, england, in, 1689, the, bulk, of, locke, s, publishing, took, place, upon, his, return, from, exile, his, aforementioned, essay, concerning, human, understanding, the, two, treatises, of, government, and, a, letter, concerning, toleration, all, appearing, in, quick, succession, locke, s, close, friend, lady, masham, invited, him, to, join, her, at, otes, the, mashams, country, house, in, essex, although, his, time, there, was, marked, by, variable, health, from, asthma, attacks, he, nevertheless, became, an, intellectual, hero, of, the, whigs, during, this, period, he, discussed, matters, with, such, figures, as, john, dryden, and, isaac, newton, after, a, lengthy, period, of, poor, health, locke, died, on, 28, october, 1704, and, is, buried, in, the, churchyard, of, all, saints, church, in, high, laver, near, harlow, in, essex, where, he, had, lived, in, the, household, of, sir, francis, masham, since, 1691, locke, never, married, nor, had, children, events, that, happened, during, locke, s, lifetime, include, the, english, restoration, the, great, plague, of, london, the, great, fire, of, london, the, glorious, revolution, and, war, against, france, including, the, battle, of, blenheim, just, before, his, death, he, did, not, live, long, enough, to, see, the, act, of, union, of, 1707, but, the, thrones, of, england, and, scotland, were, held, in, personal, union, throughout, his, lifetime, constitutional, monarchy, and, parliamentary, democracy, were, in, their, infancy, during, locke, s, time, locke, has, an, engraved, floor, memorial, plaque, at, christ, church, cathedral, oxford, in, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, locke, s, two, treatises, were, rarely, cited, historian, julian, hoppit, said, of, the, book, except, among, some, whigs, even, as, a, contribution, to, the, intense, debate, of, the, 1690s, it, made, little, impression, and, was, generally, ignored, until, 1703, though, in, oxford, in, 1695, it, was, reported, to, have, made, a, great, noise, john, kenyon, in, his, study, of, british, political, debate, from, 1689, to, 1720, has, remarked, that, locke, s, theories, were, mentioned, so, rarely, in, the, early, stages, of, the, revolution, up, to, 1692, and, even, less, thereafter, unless, it, was, to, heap, abuse, on, them, and, that, no, one, including, most, whigs, ready, for, the, idea, of, a, notional, or, abstract, contract, of, the, kind, adumbrated, by, locke, 200, in, contrast, kenyon, adds, that, algernon, sidney, s, discourses, concerning, government, were, certainly, much, more, influential, than, locke, s, two, treatises, 51, in, the, 50, years, after, queen, anne, s, death, in, 1714, the, two, treatises, were, reprinted, only, once, except, in, the, collected, works, of, locke, however, with, the, rise, of, american, resistance, to, british, taxation, the, second, treatise, of, government, gained, a, new, readership, it, was, frequently, cited, in, the, debates, in, both, america, and, britain, the, first, american, printing, occurred, in, 1773, in, boston, locke, exercised, a, profound, influence, on, political, philosophy, in, particular, on, modern, liberalism, michael, zuckert, has, argued, that, locke, launched, liberalism, by, tempering, hobbesian, absolutism, and, clearly, separating, the, realms, of, church, and, state, he, had, a, strong, influence, on, voltaire, who, called, him, le, sage, locke, his, arguments, concerning, liberty, and, the, social, contract, later, influenced, the, written, works, of, thomas, jefferson, one, passage, from, the, second, treatise, is, reproduced, verbatim, in, the, declaration, of, independence, the, reference, to, a, long, train, of, abuses, concerning, locke, thomas, jefferson, wrote, bacon, locke, and, newton, i, consider, them, as, the, three, greatest, men, that, have, ever, lived, without, any, exception, and, as, having, laid, the, foundation, of, those, superstructures, which, have, been, raised, in, the, physical, and, moral, sciences, however, locke, s, influence, may, have, been, even, more, profound, in, the, realm, of, epistemology, locke, redefined, subjectivity, or, self, leading, intellectual, historians, such, as, charles, taylor, and, jerrold, seigel, to, argue, that, locke, s, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1689, 90, marks, the, beginning, of, the, modern, western, conception, of, the, self, locke, s, theory, of, association, heavily, influenced, the, subject, matter, of, modern, psychology, at, the, time, locke, s, recognition, of, two, types, of, ideas, simple, and, complex, and, more, importantly, their, interaction, through, association, inspired, other, philosophers, such, as, david, hume, and, george, berkeley, to, revise, and, expand, this, theory, and, apply, it, to, explain, how, humans, gain, knowledge, in, the, physical, world, locke, thought, the, state, s, borders, and, the, functioning, and, enforcement, of, the, existence, of, the, state, and, its, constitution, were, metaphysically, tied, to, the, natural, rights, of, the, individual, and, this, inspired, future, liberal, politicians, and, philosophers, writing, his, letters, concerning, toleration, 1689, 1692, in, the, aftermath, of, the, european, wars, of, religion, locke, formulated, a, classic, reasoning, for, religious, tolerance, in, which, three, arguments, are, central, with, regard, to, his, position, on, religious, tolerance, locke, was, influenced, by, baptist, theologians, like, john, smyth, and, thomas, helwys, who, had, published, tracts, demanding, freedom, of, conscience, in, the, early, 17th, century, baptist, theologian, roger, williams, founded, the, colony, of, rhode, island, in, 1636, where, he, combined, a, democratic, constitution, with, unlimited, religious, freedom, his, tract, the, bloudy, tenent, of, persecution, for, cause, of, conscience, 1644, which, was, widely, read, in, the, mother, country, was, a, passionate, plea, for, absolute, religious, freedom, and, the, total, separation, of, church, and, state, freedom, of, conscience, had, had, high, priority, on, the, theological, philosophical, and, political, agenda, as, martin, luther, refused, to, recant, his, beliefs, before, the, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, at, worms, in, 1521, unless, he, would, be, proved, false, by, the, bible, locke, s, views, on, slavery, were, multifaceted, although, he, wrote, against, slavery, in, general, locke, was, an, investor, and, beneficiary, of, the, slave, trading, royal, africa, company, also, while, secretary, to, the, earl, of, shaftesbury, locke, participated, in, drafting, the, fundamental, constitutions, of, carolina, which, established, a, quasi, feudal, aristocracy, and, gave, carolinian, planters, absolute, power, over, their, enslaved, chattel, property, the, constitutions, pledged, that, every, freeman, of, carolina, shall, have, absolute, power, and, authority, over, his, negro, slaves, philosopher, martin, cohen, notes, that, locke, as, secretary, to, the, council, of, trade, and, plantations, and, a, member, of, the, board, of, trade, was, one, of, just, half, a, dozen, men, who, created, and, supervised, both, the, colonies, and, their, iniquitous, systems, of, servitude, according, to, american, historian, james, farr, locke, never, expressed, any, thoughts, about, his, contradictory, opinions, of, slavery, which, farr, ascribes, to, his, personal, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, locke, s, positions, on, slavery, have, been, described, as, hypocritical, and, laying, the, foundation, for, the, founding, fathers, to, hold, similarly, contradictory, thoughts, regarding, freedom, and, slavery, but, historian, holly, brewer, has, argued, that, locke, s, role, in, the, constitution, of, carolina, has, been, exaggerated, and, that, he, was, merely, paid, to, revise, and, make, copies, of, a, document, that, had, already, been, partially, written, before, he, became, involved, she, compares, locke, s, role, to, a, lawyer, writing, a, will, she, states, that, locke, was, paid, in, royal, african, company, stock, in, lieu, of, money, for, his, work, as, a, secretary, for, a, governmental, sub, committee, and, that, he, sold, the, stock, after, a, few, years, brewer, likewise, argues, that, locke, actively, worked, to, undermine, slavery, in, virginia, while, heading, a, board, of, trade, created, by, william, of, orange, following, the, glorious, revolution, he, specifically, attacked, colonial, policy, granting, land, to, slave, owners, and, encouraged, the, baptism, and, christian, education, of, the, children, of, enslaved, africans, to, undercut, a, major, justification, of, slavery, that, they, were, heathens, who, possessed, no, rights, in, his, two, treatises, of, government, locke, provided, a, justification, for, slavery, that, could, never, be, met, thus, rendering, invalid, all, forms, of, slavery, that, existed, moreover, because, slavery, is, invalid, there, is, a, moral, injunction, to, try, to, throw, off, and, escape, from, it, locke, also, supported, child, labour, which, was, an, intrinsic, part, of, all, pre, industrial, societies, in, his, essay, on, the, poor, law, he, discusses, the, education, of, the, poor, he, laments, that, the, children, of, labouring, people, are, an, ordinary, burden, to, the, parish, and, are, usually, maintained, in, idleness, so, that, their, labour, also, is, generally, lost, to, the, public, till, they, are, 12, or, 14, years, old, 190, therefore, he, suggests, the, setting, up, of, working, schools, for, poor, children, in, each, parish, in, england, so, that, they, will, be, from, infancy, inured, to, work, 190, he, goes, on, to, outline, the, economics, of, these, schools, arguing, not, only, that, they, will, be, profitable, for, the, parish, but, also, that, they, will, instil, a, good, work, ethic, in, the, children, 191, locke, s, political, theory, was, founded, upon, that, of, social, contract, unlike, thomas, hobbes, locke, believed, that, human, nature, is, characterised, by, reason, and, tolerance, like, hobbes, however, locke, believed, that, human, nature, allows, people, to, be, selfish, this, is, apparent, with, the, introduction, of, currency, in, a, natural, state, all, people, were, equal, and, independent, and, everyone, had, a, natural, right, to, defend, his, life, health, liberty, or, possessions, 198, most, scholars, trace, the, phrase, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, in, the, american, declaration, of, independence, to, locke, s, theory, of, rights, although, other, origins, have, been, suggested, like, hobbes, locke, assumed, that, the, sole, right, to, defend, in, the, state, of, nature, was, not, enough, so, people, established, a, civil, society, to, resolve, conflicts, in, a, civil, way, with, help, from, government, in, a, state, of, society, however, locke, never, refers, to, hobbes, by, name, and, may, instead, have, been, responding, to, other, writers, of, the, day, locke, also, advocated, governmental, separation, of, powers, and, believed, that, revolution, is, not, only, a, right, but, an, obligation, in, some, circumstances, these, ideas, would, come, to, have, profound, influence, on, the, declaration, of, independence, and, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, according, to, locke, unused, property, is, wasteful, and, an, offence, against, nature, but, with, the, introduction, of, durable, goods, men, could, exchange, their, excessive, perishable, goods, for, those, which, would, last, longer, and, thus, not, offend, the, natural, law, in, his, view, the, introduction, of, money, marked, the, culmination, of, this, process, making, possible, the, unlimited, accumulation, of, property, without, causing, waste, through, spoilage, he, also, includes, gold, or, silver, as, money, because, they, may, be, hoarded, up, without, injury, to, anyone, as, they, do, not, spoil, or, decay, in, the, hands, of, the, possessor, in, his, view, the, introduction, of, money, eliminates, limits, to, accumulation, locke, stresses, that, inequality, has, come, about, by, tacit, agreement, on, the, use, of, money, not, by, the, social, contract, establishing, civil, society, or, the, law, of, land, regulating, property, locke, was, aware, of, a, problem, posed, by, unlimited, accumulation, but, did, not, consider, it, his, task, he, just, implies, that, government, would, function, to, moderate, the, conflict, between, the, unlimited, accumulation, of, property, and, a, more, nearly, equal, distribution, of, wealth, he, does, not, identify, which, principles, that, government, should, apply, to, solve, this, problem, however, not, all, elements, of, his, thought, form, a, consistent, whole, for, example, the, labour, theory, of, value, in, the, two, treatises, of, government, stands, side, by, side, with, the, demand, and, supply, theory, of, value, developed, in, a, letter, he, wrote, titled, some, considerations, on, the, consequences, of, the, lowering, of, interest, and, the, raising, of, the, value, of, money, moreover, locke, anchors, property, in, labour, but, in, the, end, upholds, unlimited, accumulation, of, wealth, locke, s, general, theory, of, value, and, price, is, a, supply, and, demand, theory, set, out, in, a, letter, to, a, member, of, parliament, in, 1691, titled, some, considerations, on, the, consequences, of, the, lowering, of, interest, and, the, raising, of, the, value, of, money, in, it, he, refers, to, supply, as, quantity, and, demand, as, rent, the, price, of, any, commodity, rises, or, falls, by, the, proportion, of, the, number, of, buyers, and, sellers, and, that, which, regulates, the, price, is, nothing, else, but, their, quantity, in, proportion, to, their, rent, the, quantity, theory, of, money, forms, a, special, case, of, this, general, theory, his, idea, is, based, on, money, answers, all, things, ecclesiastes, or, rent, of, money, is, always, sufficient, or, more, than, enough, and, varies, very, little, locke, concludes, that, as, far, as, money, is, concerned, the, demand, for, it, is, exclusively, regulated, by, its, quantity, regardless, of, whether, the, demand, is, unlimited, or, constant, he, also, investigates, the, determinants, of, demand, and, supply, for, supply, he, explains, the, value, of, goods, as, based, on, their, scarcity, and, ability, to, be, exchanged, and, consumed, he, explains, demand, for, goods, as, based, on, their, ability, to, yield, a, flow, of, income, locke, develops, an, early, theory, of, capitalisation, such, as, of, land, which, has, value, because, by, its, constant, production, of, saleable, commodities, it, brings, in, a, certain, yearly, income, he, considers, the, demand, for, money, as, almost, the, same, as, demand, for, goods, or, land, it, depends, on, whether, money, is, wanted, as, medium, of, exchange, as, a, medium, of, exchange, he, states, money, is, capable, by, exchange, to, procure, us, the, necessaries, or, conveniences, of, life, and, for, loanable, funds, it, comes, to, be, of, the, same, nature, with, land, by, yielding, a, certain, yearly, income, or, interest, locke, distinguishes, two, functions, of, money, as, a, counter, to, measure, value, and, as, a, pledge, to, lay, claim, to, goods, he, believes, that, silver, and, gold, as, opposed, to, paper, money, are, the, appropriate, currency, for, international, transactions, silver, and, gold, he, says, are, treated, to, have, equal, value, by, all, of, humanity, and, can, thus, be, treated, as, a, pledge, by, anyone, while, the, value, of, paper, money, is, only, valid, under, the, government, which, issues, it, locke, argues, that, a, country, should, seek, a, favourable, balance, of, trade, lest, it, fall, behind, other, countries, and, suffer, a, loss, in, its, trade, since, the, world, money, stock, grows, constantly, a, country, must, constantly, seek, to, enlarge, its, own, stock, locke, develops, his, theory, of, foreign, exchanges, in, addition, to, commodity, movements, there, are, also, movements, in, country, stock, of, money, and, movements, of, capital, determine, exchange, rates, he, considers, the, latter, less, significant, and, less, volatile, than, commodity, movements, as, for, a, country, s, money, stock, if, it, is, large, relative, to, that, of, other, countries, he, says, it, will, cause, the, country, s, exchange, to, rise, above, par, as, an, export, balance, would, do, he, also, prepares, estimates, of, the, cash, requirements, for, different, economic, groups, landholders, labourers, and, brokers, in, each, group, he, posits, that, the, cash, requirements, are, closely, related, to, the, length, of, the, pay, period, he, argues, the, brokers, the, middlemen, whose, activities, enlarge, the, monetary, circuit, and, whose, profits, eat, into, the, earnings, of, labourers, and, landholders, have, a, negative, influence, on, both, personal, and, the, public, economy, to, which, they, supposedly, contribute, locke, uses, the, concept, of, property, in, both, broad, and, narrow, terms, broadly, it, covers, a, wide, range, of, human, interests, and, aspirations, more, particularly, it, refers, to, material, goods, he, argues, that, property, is, a, natural, right, that, is, derived, from, labour, in, chapter, v, of, his, second, treatise, locke, argues, that, the, individual, ownership, of, goods, and, property, is, justified, by, the, labour, exerted, to, produce, such, goods, at, least, where, there, is, enough, and, as, good, left, in, common, for, others, para, 27, or, to, use, property, to, produce, goods, beneficial, to, human, society, locke, states, in, his, second, treatise, that, nature, on, its, own, provides, little, of, value, to, society, implying, that, the, labour, expended, in, the, creation, of, goods, gives, them, their, value, from, this, premise, understood, as, a, labour, theory, of, value, locke, developed, a, labour, theory, of, property, whereby, ownership, of, property, is, created, by, the, application, of, labour, in, addition, he, believed, that, property, precedes, government, and, government, cannot, dispose, of, the, estates, of, the, subjects, arbitrarily, karl, marx, later, critiqued, locke, s, theory, of, property, in, his, own, social, theory, locke, defines, the, self, as, that, conscious, thinking, thing, whatever, substance, made, up, of, whether, spiritual, or, material, simple, or, compounded, it, matters, not, which, is, sensible, or, conscious, of, pleasure, and, pain, capable, of, happiness, or, misery, and, so, is, concerned, for, itself, as, far, as, that, consciousness, extends, he, does, not, however, wholly, ignore, substance, writing, that, the, body, too, goes, to, the, making, the, man, in, his, essay, locke, explains, the, gradual, unfolding, of, this, conscious, mind, arguing, against, both, the, augustinian, view, of, man, as, originally, sinful, and, the, cartesian, position, which, holds, that, man, innately, knows, basic, logical, propositions, locke, posits, an, empty, mind, a, tabula, rasa, which, is, shaped, by, experience, sensations, and, reflections, being, the, two, sources, of, all, of, our, ideas, he, states, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, this, source, of, ideas, every, man, has, wholly, within, himself, and, though, it, be, not, sense, as, having, nothing, to, do, with, external, objects, yet, it, is, very, like, it, and, might, properly, enough, be, called, internal, sense, locke, s, some, thoughts, concerning, education, is, an, outline, on, how, to, educate, this, mind, drawing, on, thoughts, expressed, in, letters, written, to, mary, clarke, and, her, husband, about, their, son, he, expresses, the, belief, that, education, makes, the, man, or, more, fundamentally, that, the, mind, is, an, empty, cabinet, i, think, i, may, say, that, of, all, the, men, we, meet, with, nine, parts, of, ten, are, what, they, are, good, or, evil, useful, or, not, by, their, education, locke, also, wrote, that, the, little, and, almost, insensible, impressions, on, our, tender, infancies, have, very, important, and, lasting, consequences, he, argues, that, the, associations, of, ideas, that, one, makes, when, young, are, more, important, than, those, made, later, because, they, are, the, foundation, of, the, self, they, are, put, differently, what, first, mark, the, tabula, rasa, in, his, essay, in, which, both, these, concepts, are, introduced, locke, warns, for, example, against, letting, a, foolish, maid, convince, a, child, that, goblins, and, sprites, are, associated, with, the, night, for, darkness, shall, ever, afterwards, bring, with, it, those, frightful, ideas, and, they, shall, be, so, joined, that, he, can, no, more, bear, the, one, than, the, other, this, theory, came, to, be, called, associationism, going, on, to, strongly, influence, 18th, century, thought, particularly, educational, theory, as, nearly, every, educational, writer, warned, parents, not, to, allow, their, children, to, develop, negative, associations, it, also, led, to, the, development, of, psychology, and, other, new, disciplines, with, david, hartley, s, attempt, to, discover, a, biological, mechanism, for, associationism, in, his, observations, on, man, 1749, locke, was, critical, of, descartes, s, version, of, the, dream, argument, with, locke, making, the, counter, argument, that, people, cannot, have, physical, pain, in, dreams, as, they, do, in, waking, life, some, scholars, have, seen, locke, s, political, convictions, as, being, based, from, his, religious, beliefs, locke, s, religious, trajectory, began, in, calvinist, trinitarianism, but, by, the, time, of, the, reflections, 1695, locke, was, advocating, not, just, socinian, views, on, tolerance, but, also, socinian, christology, however, wainwright, 1987, notes, that, in, the, posthumously, published, paraphrase, 1707, locke, s, interpretation, of, one, verse, ephesians, 1, 10, is, markedly, different, from, that, of, socinians, like, biddle, and, may, indicate, that, near, the, end, of, his, life, locke, returned, nearer, to, an, arian, position, thereby, accepting, christ, s, pre, existence, locke, was, at, times, not, sure, about, the, subject, of, original, sin, so, he, was, accused, of, socinianism, arianism, or, deism, locke, argued, that, the, idea, that, all, adam, s, posterity, doomed, to, eternal, infinite, punishment, for, the, transgression, of, adam, was, little, consistent, with, the, justice, or, goodness, of, the, great, and, infinite, god, leading, eric, nelson, to, associate, him, with, pelagian, ideas, however, he, did, not, deny, the, reality, of, evil, man, was, capable, of, waging, unjust, wars, and, committing, crimes, criminals, had, to, be, punished, even, with, the, death, penalty, with, regard, to, the, bible, locke, was, very, conservative, he, retained, the, doctrine, of, the, verbal, inspiration, of, the, scriptures, the, miracles, were, proof, of, the, divine, nature, of, the, biblical, message, locke, was, convinced, that, the, entire, content, of, the, bible, was, in, agreement, with, human, reason, the, reasonableness, of, christianity, 1695, although, locke, was, an, advocate, of, tolerance, he, urged, the, authorities, not, to, tolerate, atheism, because, he, thought, the, denial, of, god, s, existence, would, undermine, the, social, order, and, lead, to, chaos, that, excluded, all, atheistic, varieties, of, philosophy, and, all, attempts, to, deduce, ethics, and, natural, law, from, purely, secular, premises, in, locke, s, opinion, the, cosmological, argument, was, valid, and, proved, god, s, existence, his, political, thought, was, based, on, protestant, christian, views, additionally, locke, advocated, a, sense, of, piety, out, of, gratitude, to, god, for, giving, reason, to, men, locke, s, concept, of, man, started, with, the, belief, in, creation, like, philosophers, hugo, grotius, and, samuel, pufendorf, locke, equated, natural, law, with, the, biblical, revelation, locke, derived, the, fundamental, concepts, of, his, political, theory, from, biblical, texts, in, particular, from, genesis, 1, and, 2, creation, the, decalogue, the, golden, rule, the, teachings, of, jesus, and, the, letters, of, paul, the, apostle, the, decalogue, puts, a, person, s, life, reputation, and, property, under, god, s, protection, locke, s, philosophy, on, freedom, is, also, derived, from, the, bible, locke, derived, from, the, bible, basic, human, equality, including, equality, of, the, sexes, the, starting, point, of, the, theological, doctrine, of, imago, dei, to, locke, one, of, the, consequences, of, the, principle, of, equality, was, that, all, humans, were, created, equally, free, and, therefore, governments, needed, the, consent, of, the, governed, locke, compared, the, english, monarchy, s, rule, over, the, british, people, to, adam, s, rule, over, eve, in, genesis, which, was, appointed, by, god, following, locke, s, philosophy, the, american, declaration, of, independence, founded, human, rights, partially, on, the, biblical, belief, in, creation, locke, s, doctrine, that, governments, need, the, consent, of, the, governed, is, also, central, to, the, declaration, of, independence, locke, was, an, assiduous, book, collector, and, notetaker, throughout, his, life, by, his, death, in, 1704, locke, had, amassed, a, library, of, more, than, 3, 000, books, a, significant, number, in, the, seventeenth, century, unlike, some, of, his, contemporaries, locke, took, care, to, catalogue, and, preserve, his, library, and, his, will, made, specific, provisions, for, how, his, library, was, to, be, distributed, after, his, death, locke, s, will, offered, lady, masham, the, choice, of, any, four, folios, eight, quartos, and, twenty, books, of, less, volume, which, she, shall, choose, out, of, the, books, in, my, library, locke, also, gave, six, titles, to, his, good, friend, anthony, collins, but, locke, bequeathed, the, majority, of, his, collection, to, his, cousin, peter, king, later, lord, king, and, to, lady, masham, s, son, francis, cudworth, masham, francis, masham, was, promised, one, moiety, half, of, locke, s, library, when, he, reached, the, age, of, one, and, twenty, years, the, other, moiety, of, locke, s, books, along, with, his, manuscripts, passed, to, his, cousin, king, over, the, next, two, centuries, the, masham, portion, of, locke, s, library, was, dispersed, the, manuscripts, and, books, left, to, king, however, remained, with, king, s, descendants, later, the, earls, of, lovelace, until, most, of, the, collection, was, bought, by, the, bodleian, library, oxford, in, 1947, another, portion, of, the, books, locke, left, to, king, was, discovered, by, the, collector, and, philanthropist, paul, mellon, in, 1951, mellon, supplemented, this, discovery, with, books, from, locke, s, library, which, he, bought, privately, and, in, 1978, he, transferred, his, collection, to, the, bodleian, the, holdings, in, the, locke, room, at, the, bodleian, have, been, a, valuable, resource, for, scholars, interested, in, locke, his, philosophy, practices, for, information, management, and, the, history, of, the, book, many, of, the, books, still, contain, locke, s, signature, which, he, often, made, on, the, pastedowns, of, his, books, many, also, include, locke, s, marginalia, the, printed, books, in, locke, s, library, reflected, his, various, intellectual, interests, as, well, as, his, movements, at, different, stages, of, his, life, locke, travelled, extensively, in, france, and, the, netherlands, during, the, 1670s, and, 1680s, and, during, this, time, he, acquired, many, books, from, the, continent, only, half, of, the, books, in, locke, s, library, were, printed, in, england, while, close, to, 40, came, from, france, and, the, netherlands, these, books, cover, a, wide, range, of, subjects, according, to, john, harrison, and, peter, laslett, the, largest, genres, in, locke, s, library, were, theology, 23, 8, of, books, medicine, 11, 1, politics, and, law, 10, 7, and, classical, literature, 10, 1, the, bodleian, library, currently, holds, more, than, 800, of, the, books, from, locke, s, library, these, include, locke, s, copies, of, works, by, several, of, the, most, influential, figures, of, the, seventeenth, century, including, in, addition, to, books, owned, by, locke, the, bodleian, also, possesses, more, than, 100, manuscripts, related, to, locke, or, written, in, his, hand, like, the, books, in, locke, s, library, these, manuscripts, display, a, range, of, interests, and, provide, different, windows, into, locke, s, activity, and, relationships, several, of, the, manuscripts, include, letters, to, and, from, acquaintances, like, peter, king, ms, locke, b, 6, and, nicolas, toinard, ms, locke, c, 45, ms, locke, f, 1, 10, contain, locke, s, journals, for, most, years, between, 1675, and, 1704, some, of, the, most, significant, manuscripts, include, early, drafts, of, locke, s, writings, such, as, his, essay, concerning, human, understanding, ms, locke, f, 26, the, bodleian, also, holds, a, copy, of, robert, boyle, s, general, history, of, the, air, with, corrections, and, notes, locke, made, while, preparing, boyle, s, work, for, posthumous, publication, ms, locke, c, 37, other, manuscripts, contain, unpublished, works, among, others, ms, locke, e, 18, includes, some, of, locke, s, thoughts, on, the, glorious, revolution, which, locke, sent, to, his, friend, edward, clarke, but, never, published, one, of, the, largest, categories, of, manuscript, at, the, bodleian, comprises, locke, s, notebooks, and, commonplace, books, the, scholar, richard, yeo, calls, locke, a, master, note, taker, and, explains, that, locke, s, methodical, note, taking, pervaded, most, areas, of, his, life, in, an, unpublished, essay, of, study, locke, argued, that, a, notebook, should, work, like, a, chest, of, drawers, for, organising, information, which, would, be, a, great, help, to, the, memory, and, means, to, avoid, confusion, in, our, thoughts, locke, kept, several, notebooks, and, commonplace, books, which, he, organised, according, to, topic, ms, locke, c, 43, includes, locke, s, notes, on, theology, while, ms, locke, f, 18, 24, contain, medical, notes, other, notebooks, such, as, ms, c, 43, incorporate, several, topics, in, the, same, notebook, but, separated, into, sections, these, commonplace, books, were, highly, personal, and, were, designed, to, be, used, by, locke, himself, rather, than, accessible, to, a, wide, audience, locke, s, notes, are, often, abbreviated, and, are, full, of, codes, which, he, used, to, reference, material, across, notebooks, another, way, locke, personalised, his, notebooks, was, by, devising, his, own, method, of, creating, indexes, using, a, grid, system, and, latin, keywords, instead, of, recording, entire, words, his, indexes, shortened, words, to, their, first, letter, and, vowel, thus, the, word, epistle, would, be, classified, as, ei, locke, published, his, method, in, french, in, 1686, and, it, was, republished, posthumously, in, english, in, 1706, some, of, the, books, in, locke, s, library, at, the, bodleian, are, a, combination, of, manuscript, and, print, locke, had, some, of, his, books, interleaved, meaning, that, they, were, bound, with, blank, sheets, in, between, the, printed, pages, to, enable, annotations, locke, interleaved, and, annotated, his, five, volumes, of, the, new, testament, in, french, greek, and, latin, bodleian, locke, 9, 103, 107, locke, did, the, same, with, his, copy, of, thomas, hyde, s, bodleian, library, catalogue, bodleian, locke, 16, 17, which, locke, used, to, create, a, catalogue, of, his, own, library
