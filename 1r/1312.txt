by, the, british, as, intensely, loyal, to, britain, this, made, him, an, obvious, choice, as, obote, s, successor, although, some, have, claimed, that, amin, was, being, groomed, for, power, as,

he, faced, increasing, dissent, from, the, populace, within, uganda, as, the, economy, and, infrastructure, collapsed, as, a, result, of, the, years, of, neglect, and, abuse, after, the, killings, of,

attempt, to, distract, the, ugandan, military, and, public, from, the, crisis, at, home, other, accounts, suggest, however, that, amin, had, lost, control, of, parts, of, the, uganda, army, so, amin, s, sanction, for, the, invasion, was, a, post, facto, action, to, save, face, regarding, troops, who, had, acted, without, his, orders, in, any, case, amin, accused, tanzanian, president, julius, nyerere, of, initiating, the, war, against, uganda, after, the, hostilities, had, erupted, and, proclaimed, the, annexation, of, a, section, of, kagera, when, the, ugandan, invasion, initially,
