of, good, women, and, troilus, and, criseyde, he, is, seen, as, crucial, in, legitimising, the, literary, use, of, middle, english, when, the, dominant, literary, languages, in, england, were, still, anglo, norman, french, and, latin, chaucer, s, contemporary, thomas, hoccleve, hailed, him, as, the, firste, fyndere, of, our, fair, langage, i, e, the, first, one, capable, of, finding, poetic, matter, in, english, almost, two, thousand, english, words, are, first, attested, to, in, chaucerian, manuscripts, chaucer, was, born, in, london, most, likely, in, the, early, 1340s, by, some, accounts, including, his, monument, he, was, born, in, 1343, though, the, precise, date, and, location, remain, unknown, the, chaucer, family, offers, an, extraordinary, example, of, upward, mobility,

family, was, financially, secure, john, chaucer, married, agnes, copton, who, inherited, properties, in, 1349, including, 24, shops, in, london, from, her, uncle, hamo, de, copton, who, is, described,

chaucer, london, while, records, concerning, the, lives, of, his, contemporaries, william, langland, and, the, gawain, poet, are, practically, non, existent, since, chaucer, was, a, public, servant, his, official, life, is, very, well, documented, with, nearly, five, hundred, written, items, testifying, to, his, career, the, first, of, the, chaucer, life, records, appears, in, 1357, in, the, household, accounts, of, elizabeth, de, burgh, the, countess, of, ulster, when, he, became, the, noblewoman, s, page, through, his, father, s, connections, a, common, medieval, form, of, apprenticeship, for, boys, into, knighthood, or, prestige, appointments, the, countess, was, married, to, lionel, of, antwerp, 1st, duke, of, clarence, the, second, surviving, son, of, the, king, edward, iii, and, the, position, brought, the, teenage, chaucer, into, the, close, court, circle, where, he, was, to, remain, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, also, worked, as, a, courtier, a, diplomat, and, a, civil, servant, as, well, as, working, for, the, king, from, 1389, to, 1391, as, clerk, of, the, king, s, works, in, 1359, in, the, early, stages, of, the, hundred, years, war,

edward, paid, 16, for, his, ransom, a, considerable, sum, equivalent, to, 14, 557, in, 2023, and, chaucer, was, released, after, this, chaucer, s, life, is, uncertain, but, he, seems, to, have, travelled, in, france, spain, and, flanders, possibly, as, a, messenger, and, perhaps, even, going, on, a, pilgrimage, to, santiago, de, compostela, around, 1366, chaucer, married, philippa, de, roet, she, was, a, lady, in, waiting, to, edward, iii, s, queen, philippa, of, hainault, and, a, sister, of, katherine, swynford, who, later, c, 1396, became, the, third, wife, of, john, of, gaunt, it, is, uncertain, how, many, children, chaucer, and, philippa, had, but, three, or, four, are, most, commonly, cited, his, son, thomas, chaucer, had, an, illustrious, career, as, chief, butler, to, four, kings, envoy, to, france, and, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, thomas, s, daughter, alice, married, the, duke, of, suffolk, thomas, s, great, grandson, geoffrey, s, great, great, grandson, john, de, la, pole, earl, of, lincoln, was, the, heir, to, the, throne, designated, by, richard, iii, before, he, was, deposed, geoffrey, s, other, children, probably, included, elizabeth, chaucy, a, nun, at, barking, abbey, agnes, an, attendant, at, henry, iv, s, coronation, and, another, son, lewis, chaucer, chaucer, s, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, was, written, for, lewis, according, to, tradition, chaucer, studied, law, in, the, inner, temple, an, inn, of, court, at, this, time, he, became, a, member, of, the, royal, court, of, edward, iii, as, a, valet, de, chambre, yeoman, or, esquire, on, 20, june, 1367, a, position, which, could, entail, a, wide, variety, of, tasks, his, wife, also, received, a, pension, for, court, employment, he, travelled, abroad, many, times, at, least, some, of, them, in, his, role, as, a, valet, in, 1368, he, may, have, attended, the, wedding, of, lionel, of, antwerp, to, violante, visconti, daughter, of, galeazzo, ii, visconti, in, milan, two, other, literary, stars, of, the, era, were, in, attendance, jean, froissart, and, petrarch, around, this, time, chaucer, is, believed, to, have, written, the, book, of, the, duchess, in, honour, of, blanche, of, lancaster, the, late, wife, of, john, of, gaunt, who, died, in, 1369, of, the, plague, chaucer, travelled, to, picardy, the, next, year, as, part, of, a, military, expedition, in, 1373, he, visited, genoa, and, florence, numerous, scholars, such, as, skeat, boitani, and, rowland, suggested, that, on, this, italian, trip, he, came, into, contact, with, petrarch, or, boccaccio, they, introduced, him, to, medieval, italian, poetry, the, forms, and, stories, of, which, he, would, use, later, the, purposes, of, a, voyage, in, 1377, are, mysterious, as, details, within, the, historical, record, conflict, later, documents, suggest, it, was, a, mission, along, with, jean, froissart, to, arrange, a, marriage, between, the, future, king, richard, ii, and, a, french, princess, thereby, ending, the, hundred, years, war, if, this, was, the, purpose, of, their, trip, they, seem, to, have, been, unsuccessful, as, no, wedding, occurred, in, 1378, richard, ii, sent, chaucer, as, an, envoy, secret, dispatch, to, the, visconti, and, sir, john, hawkwood, english, condottiere, mercenary, leader, in, milan, it, has, been, speculated, that, it, was, hawkwood, on, whom, chaucer, based, his, character, the, knight, in, the, canterbury, tales, for, a, description, matches, that, of, a, 14th, century, condottiere, a, possible, indication, that, his, career, as, a, writer, was, appreciated, came, when, edward, iii, granted, chaucer, a, gallon, of, wine, daily, for, the, rest, of, his, life, for, some, unspecified, task, this, was, an, unusual, grant, but, given, on, a, day, of, celebration, st, george, s, day, 1374, when, artistic, endeavours, were, traditionally, rewarded, it, is, assumed, to, have, been, for, another, early, poetic, work, it, is, not, known, which, if, any, of, chaucer, s, extant, works, prompted, the, reward, but, the, suggestion, of, him, as, a, poet, to, a, king, places, him, as, a, precursor, to, later, poets, laureate, chaucer, continued, to, collect, the, liquid, stipend, until, richard, ii, came, to, power, after, which, it, was, converted, to, a, monetary, grant, on, 18, april, 1378, chaucer, obtained, the, very, substantial, job, of, comptroller, of, the, customs, for, the, port, of, london, which, he, began, on, 8, june, 1374, he, must, have, been, suited, for, the, role, as, he, continued, in, it, for, twelve, years, a, long, time, in, such, a, post, at, that, time, his, life, goes, undocumented, for, much, of, the, next, ten, years, but, it, is, believed, that, he, wrote, or, began, most, of, his, famous, works, during, this, period, chaucer, s, only, surviving, handwriting, dates, from, this, period, this, is, a, request, for, temporary, leave, from, work, presented, to, king, richard, ii, hitherto, believed, to, be, the, work, of, one, of, his, subordinates, due, to, the, low, level, of, language, on, 16, october, 1379, thomas, staundon, filed, a, legal, action, against, his, former, servant, cecily, chaumpaigne, and, chaucer, accusing, chaucer, of, unlawfully, employing, chaumpaigne, before, her, term, of, service, was, completed, which, violated, the, statute, of, labourers, though, eight, court, documents, dated, between, october, 1379, and, july, 1380, survive, the, action, the, case, was, never, prosecuted, no, details, survive, about, chaumpaigne, s, service, or, how, she, came, to, leave, staundon, s, employ, for, chaucer, s, it, is, not, known, if, chaucer, was, in, the, city, of, london, at, the, time, of, the, peasants, revolt, but, if, he, was, he, would, have, seen, its, leaders, pass, almost, directly, under, his, apartment, window, at, aldgate, while, still, working, as, comptroller, chaucer, appears, to, have, moved, to, kent, being, appointed, as, one, of, the, commissioners, of, peace, for, kent, at, a, time, when, french, invasion, was, a, possibility, he, is, thought, to, have, started, work, on, the, canterbury, tales, in, the, early, 1380s, he, also, became, a, member, of, parliament, for, kent, in, 1386, and, attended, the, wonderful, parliament, that, year, he, appears, to, have, been, present, at, most, of, the, 71, days, it, sat, for, which, he, was, paid, 24, 9s, on, 15, october, that, year, he, gave, a, deposition, in, the, case, of, scrope, v, grosvenor, there, is, no, further, reference, after, this, date, to, philippa, chaucer, s, wife, she, is, presumed, to, have, died, in, 1387, he, survived, the, political, upheavals, caused, by, the, lords, appellants, despite, the, fact, that, chaucer, knew, some, of, the, men, executed, over, the, affair, quite, well, on, 12, july, 1389, chaucer, was, appointed, the, clerk, of, the, king, s, works, a, sort, of, foreman, organising, most, of, the, king, s, building, projects, no, major, works, were, begun, during, his, tenure, but, he, did, conduct, repairs, on, westminster, palace, st, george, s, chapel, windsor, continued, building, the, wharf, at, the, tower, of, london, and, built, the, stands, for, a, tournament, held, in, 1390, it, may, have, been, a, difficult, job, but, it, paid, two, shillings, a, day, more, than, three, times, his, salary, as, a, comptroller, chaucer, was, also, appointed, keeper, of, the, lodge, at, the, king, s, park, in, feckenham, forest, in, worcestershire, which, was, a, largely, honorary, appointment, in, september, 1390, records, say, that, chaucer, was, robbed, and, possibly, injured, while, conducting, the, business, and, he, stopped, working, in, this, capacity, on, 17, june, 1391, he, began, as, deputy, forester, in, the, royal, forest, of, petherton, park, in, north, petherton, somerset, on, 22, june, this, was, no, sinecure, with, maintenance, an, essential, part, of, the, job, although, there, were, many, opportunities, to, derive, profit, richard, ii, granted, him, an, annual, pension, of, 20, pounds, in, 1394, equivalent, to, 22, 034, in, 2023, and, chaucer, s, name, fades, from, the, historical, record, not, long, after, richard, s, overthrow, in, 1399, the, last, few, records, of, his, life, show, his, pension, renewed, by, the, new, king, and, his, taking, a, lease, on, a, residence, within, the, close, of, westminster, abbey, on, 24, december, 1399, henry, iv, renewed, the, grants, assigned, by, richard, but, the, complaint, of, chaucer, to, his, purse, hints, that, the, grants, might, not, have, been, paid, the, last, mention, of, chaucer, is, on, 5, june, 1400, when, some, debts, owed, to, him, were, repaid, chaucer, died, of, unknown, causes, on, 25, october, 1400, although, the, only, evidence, for, this, date, comes, from, the, engraving, on, his, tomb, which, was, erected, more, than, 100, years, after, his, death, there, is, some, speculation, that, he, was, murdered, by, enemies, of, richard, ii, or, even, on, the, orders, of, his, successor, henry, iv, but, the, case, is, entirely, circumstantial, chaucer, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, in, london, as, was, his, right, owing, to, his, status, as, a, tenant, of, the, abbey, s, close, in, 1556, his, remains, were, transferred, to, a, more, ornate, tomb, making, him, the, first, writer, interred, in, the, area, now, known, as, poets, corner, chaucer, was, a, close, friend, of, john, of, gaunt, the, wealthy, duke, of, lancaster, and, father, of, henry, iv, and, he, served, under, lancaster, s, patronage, near, the, end, of, their, lives, lancaster, and, chaucer, became, brothers, in, law, when, lancaster, married, katherine, swynford, de, roet, in, 1396, she, was, the, sister, of, philippa, de, roet, whom, chaucer, had, married, in, 1366, chaucer, s, the, book, of, the, duchess, also, known, as, the, deeth, of, blaunche, the, duchesse, was, written, to, commemorate, blanche, of, lancaster, john, of, gaunt, s, first, wife, the, poem, refers, to, john, and, blanche, in, allegory, as, the, narrator, relates, the, tale, of, a, long, castel, with, walles, white, be, seynt, johan, on, a, ryche, hil, 1318, 1319, who, is, mourning, grievously, after, the, death, of, his, love, and, goode, faire, white, she, het, that, was, my, lady, name, ryght, 948, 949, the, phrase, long, castel, is, a, reference, to, lancaster, also, called, loncastel, and, longcastell, walles, white, is, thought, to, be, an, oblique, reference, to, blanche, seynt, johan, was, john, of, gaunt, s, name, saint, and, ryche, hil, is, a, reference, to, richmond, these, references, reveal, the, identity, of, the, grieving, black, knight, of, the, poem, as, john, of, gaunt, duke, of, lancaster, and, earl, of, richmond, white, is, the, english, translation, of, the, french, word, blanche, implying, that, the, white, lady, was, blanche, of, lancaster, chaucer, s, short, poem, fortune, believed, to, have, been, written, in, the, 1390s, is, also, thought, to, refer, to, lancaster, chaucer, as, narrator, openly, defies, fortune, proclaiming, that, he, has, learned, who, his, enemies, are, through, her, tyranny, and, deceit, and, declares, my, suffisaunce, 15, and, that, over, himself, hath, the, maystrye, 14, fortune, in, turn, does, not, understand, chaucer, s, harsh, words, to, her, for, she, believes, that, she, has, been, kind, to, him, claims, that, he, does, not, know, what, she, has, in, store, for, him, in, the, future, but, most, importantly, and, eek, thou, hast, thy, beste, frend, alyve, 32, 40, 48, chaucer, retorts, my, frend, maystow, nat, reven, blind, goddesse, 50, and, orders, her, to, take, away, those, who, merely, pretend, to, be, his, friends, fortune, turns, her, attention, to, three, princes, whom, she, implores, to, relieve, chaucer, of, his, pain, and, preyeth, his, beste, frend, of, his, noblesse, that, to, som, beter, estat, he, may, atteyne, 78, 79, the, three, princes, are, believed, to, represent, the, dukes, of, lancaster, york, and, gloucester, and, a, portion, of, line, 76, as, three, of, you, or, tweyne, is, thought, to, refer, to, the, ordinance, of, 1390, which, specified, that, no, royal, gift, could, be, authorised, without, the, consent, of, at, least, two, of, the, three, dukes, most, conspicuous, in, this, short, poem, is, the, number, of, references, to, chaucer, s, beste, frend, fortune, states, three, times, in, her, response, to, the, plaintiff, and, also, you, still, have, your, best, friend, alive, 32, 40, 48, she, also, refers, to, his, beste, frend, in, the, envoy, when, appealing, to, his, noblesse, to, help, chaucer, to, a, higher, estate, the, narrator, makes, a, fifth, reference, when, he, rails, at, fortune, that, she, shall, not, take, his, friend, from, him, chaucer, respected, and, admired, christians, and, was, one, himself, as, he, wrote, in, canterbury, tales, now, i, beg, all, those, that, listen, to, this, little, treatise, or, read, it, that, if, there, be, anything, in, it, that, pleases, them, they, thank, our, lord, jesus, christ, for, it, from, whom, proceeds, all, understanding, and, goodness, though, he, was, aware, that, as, in, any, place, some, people, in, the, church, were, venal, and, corrupt, chaucer, s, first, major, work, was, the, book, of, the, duchess, an, elegy, for, blanche, of, lancaster, who, died, in, 1368, two, other, early, works, were, anelida, and, arcite, and, the, house, of, fame, he, wrote, many, of, his, major, works, in, a, prolific, period, when, he, worked, as, customs, comptroller, for, london, 1374, to, 1386, his, parlement, of, foules, the, legend, of, good, women, and, troilus, and, criseyde, all, date, from, this, time, it, is, believed, that, he, started, the, canterbury, tales, in, the, 1380s, chaucer, also, translated, boethius, consolation, of, philosophy, and, the, romance, of, the, rose, by, guillaume, de, lorris, extended, by, jean, de, meun, eustache, deschamps, called, himself, a, nettle, in, chaucer, s, garden, of, poetry, in, 1385, thomas, usk, made, glowing, mention, of, chaucer, and, john, gower, also, lauded, him, chaucer, s, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, describes, the, form, and, use, of, the, astrolabe, in, detail, and, is, sometimes, cited, as, the, first, example, of, technical, writing, in, the, english, language, it, indicates, that, chaucer, was, versed, in, science, in, addition, to, his, literary, talents, the, equatorie, of, the, planetis, is, a, scientific, work, similar, to, the, treatise, and, sometimes, ascribed, to, chaucer, because, of, its, language, and, handwriting, an, identification, which, scholars, no, longer, deem, tenable, chaucer, wrote, in, continental, accentual, syllabic, metre, a, style, which, had, developed, in, english, literature, since, around, the, 12th, century, as, an, alternative, to, the, alliterative, anglo, saxon, metre, chaucer, is, known, for, metrical, innovation, inventing, the, rhyme, royal, and, he, was, one, of, the, first, english, poets, to, use, the, five, stress, line, a, decasyllabic, cousin, to, the, iambic, pentametre, in, his, work, with, only, a, few, anonymous, short, works, using, it, before, him, the, arrangement, of, these, five, stress, lines, into, rhyming, couplets, first, seen, in, his, the, legend, of, good, women, was, used, in, much, of, his, later, work, and, became, one, of, the, standard, poetic, forms, in, english, his, early, influence, as, a, satirist, is, also, important, with, the, common, humorous, device, the, funny, accent, of, a, regional, dialect, apparently, making, its, first, appearance, in, the, reeve, s, tale, the, poetry, of, chaucer, along, with, other, writers, of, the, era, is, credited, with, helping, to, standardise, the, london, dialect, of, the, middle, english, language, from, a, combination, of, the, kentish, and, midlands, dialects, this, is, probably, overstated, the, influence, of, the, court, chancery, and, bureaucracy, of, which, chaucer, was, a, part, remains, a, more, probable, influence, on, the, development, of, standard, english, modern, english, is, somewhat, distanced, from, the, language, of, chaucer, s, poems, owing, to, the, effect, of, the, great, vowel, shift, sometime, after, his, death, this, change, in, the, pronunciation, of, english, still, not, fully, understood, makes, the, reading, of, chaucer, difficult, for, the, modern, audience, the, status, of, the, final, e, in, chaucer, s, verse, is, uncertain, it, seems, likely, that, during, the, period, of, chaucer, s, writing, the, final, e, was, dropping, out, of, colloquial, english, and, that, its, use, was, somewhat, irregular, it, may, have, been, a, vestige, of, the, old, english, dative, singular, suffix, e, attached, to, most, nouns, chaucer, s, versification, suggests, that, the, final, e, is, sometimes, to, be, vocalised, and, sometimes, to, be, silent, however, this, remains, a, point, on, which, there, is, disagreement, most, scholars, pronounce, it, as, a, schwa, when, it, is, vocalised, besides, the, irregular, spelling, much, of, the, vocabulary, is, recognisable, to, the, modern, reader, chaucer, is, also, recorded, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, as, the, first, author, to, use, many, common, english, words, in, his, writings, these, words, were, probably, frequently, used, in, the, language, at, the, time, but, chaucer, was, the, earliest, extant, manuscript, source, with, his, ear, for, common, speech, acceptable, alkali, altercation, amble, angrily, annex, annoyance, approaching, arbitration, armless, army, arrogant, arsenic, arc, artillery, and, aspect, are, just, some, of, almost, two, thousand, english, words, first, attested, in, chaucer, widespread, knowledge, of, chaucer, s, works, is, attested, by, the, many, poets, who, imitated, or, responded, to, his, writing, john, lydgate, was, one, of, the, earliest, poets, to, write, continuations, of, chaucer, s, unfinished, tales, at, the, same, time, robert, henryson, s, testament, of, cresseid, completes, the, story, of, cressida, left, unfinished, in, his, troilus, and, criseyde, many, of, the, manuscripts, of, chaucer, s, works, contain, material, from, these, poets, and, later, appreciations, by, the, romantic, era, poets, were, shaped, by, their, failure, to, distinguish, the, later, additions, from, the, original, chaucer, writers, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, such, as, john, dryden, admired, chaucer, for, his, stories, but, not, for, his, rhythm, and, rhyme, as, few, critics, could, then, read, middle, english, and, the, text, had, been, butchered, by, printers, leaving, a, somewhat, unadmirable, mess, it, was, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, that, the, official, chaucerian, canon, accepted, today, was, decided, upon, largely, as, a, result, of, walter, william, skeat, s, work, roughly, seventy, five, years, after, chaucer, s, death, the, canterbury, tales, was, selected, by, william, caxton, as, one, of, the, first, books, to, be, printed, in, england, chaucer, is, sometimes, considered, the, source, of, the, english, vernacular, tradition, his, achievement, for, the, language, can, be, seen, as, part, of, a, general, historical, trend, towards, the, creation, of, a, vernacular, literature, after, the, example, of, dante, in, many, parts, of, europe, a, parallel, trend, in, chaucer, s, lifetime, was, underway, in, scotland, through, the, work, of, his, slightly, earlier, contemporary, john, barbour, barbour, s, work, was, likely, to, have, been, even, more, general, as, is, evidenced, by, the, example, of, the, pearl, poet, in, the, north, of, england, although, chaucer, s, language, is, much, closer, to, modern, english, than, the, text, of, beowulf, such, that, unlike, that, of, beowulf, a, modern, english, speaker, with, an, extensive, vocabulary, of, archaic, words, may, understand, it, it, differs, enough, that, most, publications, modernise, his, idiom, the, following, is, a, sample, from, the, prologue, of, the, summoner, s, tale, that, compares, chaucer, s, text, to, a, modern, translation, the, first, recorded, association, of, valentine, s, day, with, romantic, love, is, believed, to, be, in, chaucer, s, parlement, of, foules, 1382, a, dream, vision, portraying, a, parliament, for, birds, to, choose, their, mates, honouring, the, first, anniversary, of, the, engagement, of, fifteen, year, old, king,

language, of, england, upon, which, chaucer, was, the, first, to, confer, celebrity, has, amply, justified, the, foresight, which, led, him, to, disdain, all, others, for, its, sake, and, in, turn, has, conferred, an, enduring, celebrity, upon, him, who, trusted, his, reputation, to, it, without, reserve, t, r, lounsbury, the, poet, thomas, hoccleve, who, may, have, met, chaucer, and, considered, him, his, role, model, hailed, chaucer, as, the, firste, fyndere, of, our, fair, langage, john, lydgate, referred, to, chaucer, within, his, own, text, the, fall, of, princes, as, the, lodesterre, guiding, principle, off, our, language, around, two, centuries, later, sir, philip, sidney, greatly, praised, troilus, and, criseyde, in, his, own, defence, of, poesie, during, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, chaucer, came, to, be, viewed, as, a, symbol, of, the, nation, s, poetic, heritage, in, charles, dickens, 1850, novel, david, copperfield, the, victorian, era, author, echoed, chaucer, s, use, of, luke, 23, 34, from, troilus, and, criseyde, dickens, held, a, copy, in, his, library, among, other, works, of, chaucer, with, g, k, chesterton, writing, among, the, great, canonical, english, authors, chaucer, and, dickens, have, the, most, in, common, the, large, number, of, surviving, manuscripts, of, chaucer, s, works, is, testimony, to, the, enduring, interest, in, his, poetry, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, printing, press, there, are, 83, surviving, manuscripts, of, the, canterbury, tales, in, whole, or, part, alone, along, with, sixteen, of, troilus, and, criseyde, including, the, personal, copy, of, henry, iv, given, the, ravages, of, time, it, is, likely, that, these, surviving, manuscripts, represent, hundreds, since, lost, chaucer, s, original, audience, was, a, courtly, one, and, would, have, included, women, as, well, as, men, of, the, upper, social, classes, yet, even, before, his, death, in, 1400, chaucer, s, audience, had, begun, to, include, members, of, the, rising, literate, middle, and, merchant, classes, this, included, many, lollard, sympathisers, who, may, well, have, been, inclined, to, read, chaucer, as, one, of, their, own, lollards, were, particularly, attracted, to, chaucer, s, satirical, writings, about, friars, priests, and, other, church, officials, in, 1464, john, baron, a, tenant, farmer, in, agmondesham, amersham, in, buckinghamshire, was, brought, before, john, chadworth, the, bishop, of, lincoln, on, charges, of, being, a, lollard, heretic, he, confessed, to, owning, a, boke, of, the, tales, of, caunterburie, among, other, suspect, volumes, the, first, english, printer, william, caxton, was, responsible, for, the, first, two, folio, editions, of, the, canterbury, tales, published, in, 1478, and, 1483, caxton, s, second, printing, by, his, own, account, came, about, because, a, customer, complained, that, the, printed, text, differed, from, a, manuscript, he, knew, caxton, obligingly, used, the, man, s, manuscript, as, his, source, both, caxton, editions, carry, the, equivalent, of, manuscript, authority, caxton, s, edition, was, reprinted, by, his, successor, wynkyn, de, worde, but, this, edition, has, no, independent, authority, richard, pynson, the, king, s, printer, under, henry, viii, for, about, twenty, years, was, the, first, to, collect, and, sell, something, that, resembled, an, edition, of, the, collected, works, of, chaucer, however, in, the, process, he, introduced, five, previously, printed, texts, that, are, now, known, not, to, be, chaucer, s, the, collection, is, actually, three, separately, printed, texts, or, collections, of, texts, bound, together, as, one, volume, there, is, a, likely, connection, between, pynson, s, product, and, william, thynne, s, a, mere, six, years, later, thynne, had, a, successful, career, from, the, 1520s, until, his, death, in, 1546, as, chief, clerk, of, the, kitchen, of, henry, viii, one, of, the, masters, of, the, royal, household, he, spent, years, comparing, various, versions, of, chaucer, s, works, and, selected, 41, pieces, for, publication, while, there, were, questions, over, the, authorship, of, some, of, the, material, there, is, no, doubt, that, this, was, the, first, comprehensive, view, of, chaucer, s, work, the, workes, of, geffray, chaucer, published, in, 1532, was, the, first, edition, of, chaucer, s, collected, works, thynne, s, editions, of, chaucer, s, works, in, 1532, and, 1542, were, the, first, significant, contributions, to, the, existence, of, a, widely, recognised, chaucerian, canon, thynne, represents, his, edition, as, a, book, sponsored, by, and, supportive, of, the, king, who, is, praised, in, the, preface, by, sir, brian, tuke, thynne, s, canon, brought, the, number, of, apocryphal, works, associated, with, chaucer, to, a, total, of, 28, even, if, that, was, not, his, intention, as, with, pynson, once, included, in, the, works, pseudepigraphic, texts, stayed, with, those, works, regardless, of, their, first, editor, s, intentions, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, chaucer, was, printed, more, than, any, other, english, author, and, he, was, the, first, author, to, have, his, works, collected, in, comprehensive, single, volume, editions, in, which, a, chaucer, canon, began, to, cohere, some, scholars, contend, that, 16th, century, editions, of, chaucer, s, works, set, the, precedent, for, all, other, english, authors, regarding, presentation, prestige, and, success, in, print, these, editions, certainly, established, chaucer, s, reputation, but, they, also, began, the, complicated, process, of, reconstructing, and, frequently, inventing, chaucer, s, biography, and, the, canonical, list, of, works, which, were, attributed, to, him, probably, the, most, significant, aspect, of, the, growing, apocrypha, is, that, beginning, with, thynne, s, editions, it, began, to, include, medieval, texts, that, made, chaucer, appear, as, a, proto, protestant, lollard, primarily, the, testament, of, love, and, the, plowman, s, tale, as, chaucerian, works, that, were, not, considered, apocryphal, until, the, late, 19th, century, these, medieval, texts, enjoyed, a, new, life, with, english, protestants, carrying, on, the, earlier, lollard, project, of, appropriating, existing, texts, and, authors, who, seemed, sympathetic, or, malleable, enough, to, be, construed, as, sympathetic, to, their, cause, the, official, chaucer, of, the, early, printed, volumes, of, his, works, was, construed, as, a, proto, protestant, as, the, same, was, done, concurrently, with, william, langland, and, piers, plowman, the, famous, plowman, s, tale, did, not, enter, thynne, s, works, until, the, second, 1542, edition, its, entry, was, surely, facilitated, by, thynne, s, inclusion, of, thomas, usk, s, testament, of, love, in, the, first, edition, the, testament, of, love, imitates, borrows, from, and, thus, resembles, usk, s, contemporary, chaucer, testament, of, love, also, appears, to, borrow, from, piers, plowman, since, the, testament, of, love, mentions, its, author, s, part, in, a, failed, plot, book, 1, chapter, 6, his, imprisonment, and, perhaps, a, recantation, of, possibly, lollardism, heresy, all, this, was, associated, with, chaucer, usk, himself, was, executed, as, a, traitor, in, 1388, john, foxe, took, this, recantation, of, heresy, as, a, defence, of, the, true, faith, calling, chaucer, a, right, wiclevian, and, erroneously, identifying, him, as, a, schoolmate, and, close, friend, of, john, wycliffe, at, merton, college, oxford, thomas, speght, is, careful, to, highlight, these, facts, in, his, editions, and, his, life, of, chaucer, no, other, sources, for, the, testament, of, love, exist, there, is, only, thynne, s, construction, of, whatever, manuscript, sources, he, had, john, stow, 1525, 1605, was, an, antiquarian, and, also, a, chronicler, his, edition, of, chaucer, s, works, in, 1561, brought, the, apocrypha, to, more, than, 50, titles, more, were, added, in, the, 17th, century, and, they, remained, as, late, as, 1810, well, after, thomas, tyrwhitt, pared, the, canon, down, in, his, 1775, edition, the, compilation, and, printing, of, chaucer, s, works, was, from, its, beginning, a, political, enterprise, since, it, was, intended, to, establish, an, english, national, identity, and, history, that, grounded, and, authorised, the, tudor, monarchy, and, church, what, was, added, to, chaucer, often, helped, represent, him, favourably, to, protestant, england, in, his, 1598, edition, of, the, works, speght, probably, taking, cues, from, foxe, made, good, use, of, usk, s, account, of, his, political, intrigue, and, imprisonment, in, the, testament, of, love, to, assemble, a, largely, fictional, life, of, our, learned, english, poet, geffrey, chaucer, speght, s, life, presents, readers, with, an, erstwhile, radical, in, troubled, times, much, like, their, own, a, proto, protestant, who, eventually, came, round, to, the, king, s, views, on, religion, speght, states, in, the, second, year, of, richard, the, second, the, king, tooke, geffrey, chaucer, and, his, lands, into, his, protection, the, occasion, wherof, no, doubt, was, some, daunger, and, trouble, whereinto, he, was, fallen, by, favouring, some, rash, attempt, of, the, common, people, under, the, discussion, of, chaucer, s, friends, namely, john, of, gaunt, speght, further, explains, later, in, the, argument, to, the, testament, of, love, speght, adds, speght, is, also, the, source, of, the, famous, tale, of, chaucer, being, fined, for, beating, a, franciscan, friar, in, fleet, street, as, well, as, a, fictitious, coat, of, arms, and, family, tree, ironically, and, perhaps, consciously, so, an, introductory, apologetic, letter, in, speght, s, edition, from, francis, beaumont, defends, the, unseemly, low, and, bawdy, bits, in, chaucer, from, an, elite, classicist, position, francis, thynne, noted, some, of, these, inconsistencies, in, his, animadversions, insisting, that, chaucer, was, not, a, commoner, and, he, objected, to, the, friar, beating, story, yet, thynne, himself, underscores, chaucer, s, support, for, popular, religious, reform, associating, chaucer, s, views, with, his, father, william, thynne, s, attempts, to, include, the, plowman, s, tale, and, the, pilgrim, s, tale, in, the, 1532, and, 1542, works, the, myth, of, the, protestant, chaucer, continues, to, have, a, lasting, impact, on, a, large, body, of, chaucerian, scholarship, though, it, is, extremely, rare, for, a, modern, scholar, to, suggest, chaucer, supported, a, religious, movement, that, did, not, exist, until, more, than, a, century, after, his, death, the, predominance, of, this, thinking, for, so, many, centuries, left, it, for, granted, that, chaucer, was, at, least, hostile, toward, catholicism, this, assumption, forms, a, large, part, of, many, critical, approaches, to, chaucer, s, works, including, neo, marxism, alongside, chaucer, s, works, the, most, impressive, literary, monument, of, the, period, is, john, foxe, s, acts, and, monuments, as, with, the, chaucer, editions, it, was, critically, significant, to, english, protestant, identity, and, included, chaucer, in, its, project, foxe, s, chaucer, both, derived, from, and, contributed, to, the, printed, editions, of, chaucer, s, works, particularly, the, pseudepigrapha, jack, upland, was, first, printed, in, foxe, s, acts, and, monuments, and, then, it, appeared, in, speght, s, edition, of, chaucer, s, works, speght, s, life, of, chaucer, echoes, foxe, s, own, account, which, is, itself, dependent, upon, the, earlier, editions, that, added, the, testament, of, love, and, the, plowman, s, tale, to, their, pages, like, speght, s, chaucer, foxe, s, chaucer, was, also, a, shrewd, or, lucky, political, survivor, in, his, 1563, edition, foxe, thought, it, not, out, of, season, to, couple, some, mention, of, geoffrey, chaucer, with, a, discussion, of, john, colet, a, possible, source, for, john, skelton, s, character, colin, clout, probably, referring, to, the, 1542, act, for, the, advancement, of, true, religion, foxe, said, that, he, marvel, to, consider, how, the, bishops, condemning, and, abolishing, all, manner, of, english, books, and, treatises, which, might, bring, the, people, to, any, light, of, knowledge, did, yet, authorise, the, works, of, chaucer, to, remain, still, and, to, be, occupied, who, no, doubt, saw, into, religion, as, much, almost, as, even, we, do, now, and, uttereth, in, his, works, no, less, and, seemeth, to, be, a, right, wicklevian, or, else, there, never, was, any, and, that, all, his, works, almost, if, they, be, thoroughly, advised, will, testify, albeit, done, in, mirth, and, covertly, and, especially, the, latter, end, of, his, third, book, of, the, testament, of, love, wherein, except, a, man, be, altogether, blind, he, may, espy, him, at, the, full, although, in, the, same, book, as, in, all, others, he, useth, to, do, under, shadows, covertly, as, under, a, visor, he, suborneth, truth, in, such, sort, as, both, privily, she, may, profit, the, godly, minded, and, yet, not, be, espied, of, the, crafty, adversary, and, therefore, the, bishops, belike, taking, his, works, but, for, jests, and, toys, in, condemning, other, books, yet, permitted, his, books, to, be, read, it, is, significant, too, that, foxe, s, discussion, of, chaucer, leads, into, his, history, of, the, reformation, of, the, church, of, christ, in, the, time, of, martin, luther, when, printing, being, opened, incontinently, ministered, unto, the, church, the, instruments, and, tools, of, learning, and, knowledge, which, were, good, books, and, authors, which, before, lay, hid, and, unknown, the, science, of, printing, being, found, immediately, followed, the, grace, of, god, which, stirred, up, good, wits, aptly, to, conceive, the, light, of, knowledge, and, judgment, by, which, light, darkness, began, to, be, espied, and, ignorance, to, be, detected, truth, from, error, religion, from, superstition, to, be, discerned, foxe, downplays, chaucer, s, bawdy, and, amorous, writing, insisting, that, it, all, testifies, to, his, piety, troubling, material, is, deemed, metaphoric, while, the, more, forthright, satire, which, foxe, prefers, is, taken, literally, john, urry, produced, the, first, edition, of, the, complete, works, of, chaucer, in, a, latin, font, published, posthumously, in, 1721, according, to, the, editors, several, tales, were, printed, and, for, the, first, time, a, biography, of, chaucer, a, glossary, of, old, english, words, and, testimonials, of, author, writers, concerning, chaucer, dating, back, to, the, 16th, century, according, to, a, s, g, edwards, this, was, the, first, collected, edition, of, chaucer, to, be, printed, in, roman, type, the, life, of, chaucer, prefixed, to, the, volume, was, the, work, of, the, reverend, john, dart, corrected, and, revised, by, timothy, thomas, the, glossary, appended, was, also, mainly, compiled, by, thomas, the, text, of, urry, s, edition, has, often, been, criticised, by, subsequent, editors, for, its, frequent, conjectural, emendations, mainly, to, make, it, conform, to, his, sense, of, chaucer, s, metre, the, justice, of, such, criticisms, should, not, obscure, his, achievement, his, is, the, first, edition, of, chaucer, in, nearly, a, hundred, and, fifty, years, to, consult, any, manuscripts, additionally, it, is, the, first, since, that, of, william, thynne, in, 1534, to, seek, systematically, to, assemble, a, substantial, number, of, manuscripts, to, establish, his, text, it, is, also, the, first, edition, to, offer, descriptions, of, the, manuscripts, of, chaucer, s, works, and, the, first, to, print, texts, of, gamelyn, and, the, tale, of, beryn, works, ascribed, to, but, not, by, chaucer, although, chaucer, s, works, had, long, been, admired, serious, scholarly, work, on, his, legacy, did, not, begin, until, the, late, 18th, century, when, thomas, tyrwhitt, edited, the, canterbury, tales, and, it, did, not, become, an, established, academic, discipline, until, the, 19th, century, scholars, such, as, frederick, james, furnivall, who, founded, the, chaucer, society, in, 1868, pioneered, the, establishment, of, diplomatic, editions, of, chaucer, s, primary, texts, along, with, careful, accounts, of, chaucer, s, language, and, prosody, walter, william, skeat, who, like, furnivall, was, closely, associated, with, the, oxford, english, dictionary, established, the, base, text, of, all, of, chaucer, s, works, with, his, edition, published, by, oxford, university, press, later, editions, by, john, h, fisher, and, larry, d, benson, offered, further, refinements, along, with, critical, commentary, and, bibliographies, with, the, textual, issues, largely, addressed, if, not, resolved, attention, turned, to, the, questions, of, chaucer, s, themes, structure, and, audience, the, chaucer, research, project, at, the, university, of, chicago, began, in, 1924, the, chaucer, review, was, founded, in, 1966, and, has, maintained, its, position, as, the, pre, eminent, journal, of, chaucer, studies, in, 1994, literary, critic, harold, bloom, placed,

chronological, order, but, scholars, still, debate, the, dating, of, most, of, chaucer, s, output, works, made, up, of, a, collection, of, stories, may, have, been, compiled, over, a, long, period,
