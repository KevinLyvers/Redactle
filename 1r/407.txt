at, six, years, old, i, remember, to, have, read, belisarius, robinson, crusoe, and, philip, quarll, and, then, i, found, the, arabian, nights, entertainments, one, tale, of, which, the, tale, of, a, man, who, was, compelled, to, seek, for, a, pure, virgin, made, so, deep, an, impression, on, me, i, had, read, it, in, the, evening, while, my, mother, was, mending, stockings, that, i, was, haunted, by, spectres, whenever, i, was, in, the, dark, and, i, distinctly, remember, the, anxious, and, fearful, eagerness, with, which, i, used, to, watch, the, window, in, which, the, books, lay, and, whenever, the, sun, lay, upon, them, i, would, seize, it, carry, it, by, the, wall, and, bask, and, read, coleridge, seems, to, have, appreciated, his, teacher, as, he, wrote, in, recollections, of, his, school, days, in, biographia, literaria, i, enjoyed, the, inestimable, advantage, of, a, very, sensible, though, at, the, same, time, a, very, severe, master, at, the, same, time, that, we, were, studying, the, greek, tragic, poets, he, made, us, read, shakespeare, and, milton, as, lessons, and, they, were, the, lessons, too, which, required, most, time, and, trouble, to, bring, up, so, as, to, escape, his, censure, i, learnt, from, him, that, poetry, even, that, of, the, loftiest, and, seemingly, that, of, the, wildest, odes, had, a, logic, of, its, own, as, severe, as, that, of, science, and, more, difficult, because, more, subtle, more, complex, and, dependent, on, more, and, more, fugitive, causes, in, our, own, english, compositions, at, least, for, the, last, three, years, of, our, school, education, he, showed, no, mercy, to, phrase, metaphor, or, image, unsupported, by, a, sound, sense, or, where, the, same, sense, might, have, been, conveyed, with, equal, force, and, dignity, in, plainer, words, in, fancy, i, can, almost, hear, him, now, exclaiming, harp, harp, lyre, pen, and, ink, boy, you, mean, muse, boy, muse, your, nurse, s, daughter, you, mean, pierian, spring, oh, aye, the, cloister, pump, i, suppose, be, this, as, it, may, there, was, one, custom, of, our, master, s, which, i, cannot, pass, over, in, silence, because, i, think, it, worthy, of, imitation, he, would, often, permit, our, theme, exercises, to, accumulate, till, each, lad, had, four, or, five, to, be, looked, over, then, placing, the, whole, number, abreast, on, his, desk, he, would, ask, the, writer, why, this, or, that, sentence, might, not, have, found, as, appropriate, a, place, under, this, or, that, other, thesis, and, if, no, satisfying, answer, could, be, returned, and, two, faults, of, the, same, kind, were, found, in, one, exercise, the, irrevocable, verdict, followed, the, exercise, was, torn, up, and, another, on, the, same, subject, to, be, produced, in, addition, to, the, tasks, of, the, day, he, later, wrote, of, his, loneliness, at, school, in, the, poem, frost, at, midnight, with, unclosed, lids, already, had, i, dreamt, of, my, sweet, birth, place, from, 1791, until, 1794, coleridge, attended, jesus, college, cambridge, in, 1792, he, won, the, browne, gold, medal, for, an, ode, that, he, wrote, attacking, the, slave, trade, in, december, 1793, he, left, the, college, and, enlisted, in, the, 15th, the, king, s, light, dragoons, using, the, false, name, silas, tomkyn, comberbache, perhaps, because, of, debt, or, because, the, girl, that, he, loved, mary, evans, had, rejected, him, his, brothers, arranged, for, his, discharge, a, few, months, later, under, the, reason, of, insanity, and, he, was, readmitted, to, jesus, college, though, he, would, never, receive, a, degree, from, the, university, at, jesus, college, coleridge, was, introduced, to, political, and, theological, ideas, then, considered, radical, including, those, of, the, poet, robert, southey, with, whom, he, collaborated, on, the, play, the, fall, of, robespierre, coleridge, joined, southey, in, a, plan, later, abandoned, to, found, a, utopian, commune, like, society, called, pantisocracy, in, the, wilderness, of, pennsylvania, in, 1795, the, two, friends, became, engaged, to, sisters, sara, and, edith, fricker, with, sara, becoming, the, subject, of, coleridge, s, poem, the, eolian, harp, they, wed, that, year, in, st, mary, redcliffe, bristol, but, coleridge, s, marriage, with, sara, proved, unhappy, by, 1804, they, were, separated, when, coleridge, wrote, to, his, brother, he, laid, all, the, blame, on, sara, the, few, friends, who, have, been, witnesses, of, my, domestic, life, have, long, advised, separation, as, the, necessary, condition, of, everything, desirable, for, me, subsequent, biographers, have, not, agreed, with, coleridge, s, negative, view, of, the, wife, he, called, his, sally, pally, when, he, first, married, her, a, third, sister, mary, had, already, married, a, third, poet, robert, lovell, and, both, became, partners, in, pantisocracy, lovell, also, introduced, coleridge, and, southey, to, their, future, patron, joseph, cottle, but, died, of, a, fever, in, april, 1796, coleridge, was, with, him, at, his, death, in, 1796, he, released, his, first, volume, of, poems, entitled, poems, on, various, subjects, which, also, included, four, poems, by, charles, lamb, as, well, as, a, collaboration, with, robert, southey, and, a, work, suggested, by, his, and, lamb, s, schoolfriend, robert, favell, among, the, poems, were, religious, musings, monody, on, the, death, of, chatterton, and, an, early, version, of, the, eolian, harp, entitled, effusion, 35, a, second, edition, was, printed, in, 1797, this, time, including, an, appendix, of, works, by, lamb, and, charles, lloyd, a, young, poet, to, whom, coleridge, had, become, a, private, tutor, in, 1796, he, also, privately, printed, sonnets, from, various, authors, including, sonnets, by, lamb, lloyd, southey, and, himself, as, well, as, older, poets, such, as, william, lisle, bowles, coleridge, made, plans, to, establish, a, journal, the, watchman, to, be, printed, every, eight, days, to, avoid, a, weekly, newspaper, tax, the, first, issue, of, the, short, lived, journal, was, published, in, march, 1796, it, had, ceased, publication, by, may, of, that, year, the, years, 1797, and, 1798, during, which, he, lived, in, what, is, now, known, as, coleridge, cottage, in, nether, stowey, somerset, were, among, the, most, fruitful, of, coleridge, s, life, in, 1795, coleridge, met, poet, william, wordsworth, and, his, sister, dorothy, wordsworth, having, visited, him, and, being, enchanted, by, the, surroundings, rented, alfoxton, park, a, little, over, three, miles, away, besides, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, coleridge, composed, the, symbolic, poem, kubla, khan, written, coleridge, claimed, as, a, result, of, an, opium, dream, in, a, kind, of, a, reverie, and, the, first, part, of, the, narrative, poem, christabel, the, writing, of, kubla, khan, written, about, the, mongol, emperor, kublai, khan, and, his, legendary, palace, at, xanadu, was, said, to, have, been, interrupted, by, the, arrival, of, a, person, on, business, from, porlock, an, event, that, has, been, embellished, upon, in, such, varied, contexts, as, science, fiction, and, nabokov, s, lolita, during, this, period, he, also, produced, his, much, praised, conversation, poems, this, lime, tree, bower, my, prison, frost, at, midnight, and, the, nightingale, in, 1798, coleridge, and, wordsworth, published, a, joint, volume, of, poetry, lyrical, ballads, which, proved, to, be, the, starting, point, for, the, english, romantic, age, wordsworth, may, have, contributed, more, poems, but, the, real, star, of, the, collection, was, coleridge, s, first, version, of, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, it, was, the, longest, work, and, drew, more, praise, and, attention, than, anything, else, in, the, volume, in, the, spring, coleridge, temporarily, took, over, for, rev, joshua, toulmin, at, taunton, s, mary, street, unitarian, chapel, while, rev, toulmin, grieved, over, the, drowning, death, of, his, daughter, jane, poetically, commenting, on, toulmin, s, strength, coleridge, wrote, in, a, 1798, letter, to, john, prior, estlin, i, walked, into, taunton, eleven, miles, and, back, again, and, performed, the, divine, services, for, dr, toulmin, i, suppose, you, must, have, heard, that, his, daughter, jane, on, 15, april, 1798, in, a, melancholy, derangement, suffered, herself, to, be, swallowed, up, by, the, tide, on, the, sea, coast, between, sidmouth, and, bere, beer, these, events, cut, cruelly, into, the, hearts, of, old, men, but, the, good, dr, toulmin, bears, it, like, the, true, practical, christian, there, is, indeed, a, tear, in, his, eye, but, that, eye, is, lifted, up, to, the, heavenly, father, coleridge, also, worked, briefly, in, shropshire, where, he, came, in, december, 1797, as, locum, to, its, local, unitarian, minister, dr, rowe, in, their, church, in, the, high, street, at, shrewsbury, he, is, said, to, have, read, his, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, at, a, literary, evening, in, mardol, he, was, then, contemplating, a, career, in, the, ministry, and, gave, a, probationary, sermon, in, high, street, church, on, sunday, 14, january, 1798, william, hazlitt, a, unitarian, minister, s, son, was, in, the, congregation, having, walked, from, wem, to, hear, him, coleridge, later, visited, hazlitt, and, his, father, at, wem, but, within, a, day, or, two, of, preaching, he, received, a, letter, from, josiah, wedgwood, ii, who, had, offered, to, help, him, out, of, financial, difficulties, with, an, annuity, of, 150, approximately, 13, 000, in, today, s, money, per, year, on, condition, he, give, up, his, ministerial, career, coleridge, accepted, this, to, the, disappointment, of, hazlitt, who, hoped, to, have, him, as, a, neighbour, in, shropshire, from, 16, september, 1798, coleridge, and, the, wordsworths, left, for, a, stay, in, germany, coleridge, soon, went, his, own, way, and, spent, much, of, his, time, in, university, towns, in, february, 1799, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, where, he, attended, lectures, by, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, and, johann, gottfried, eichhorn, during, this, period, he, became, interested, in, german, philosophy, especially, the, transcendental, idealism, and, critical, philosophy, of, immanuel, kant, and, in, the, literary, criticism, of, the, 18th, century, dramatist, gotthold, lessing, coleridge, studied, german, and, after, his, return, to, england, translated, the, dramatic, trilogy, wallenstein, by, the, german, classical, poet, friedrich, schiller, into, english, he, continued, to, pioneer, these, ideas, through, his, own, critical, writings, for, the, rest, of, his, life, sometimes, without, attribution, although, they, were, unfamiliar, and, difficult, for, a, culture, dominated, by, empiricism, in, 1799, coleridge, and, the, wordsworths, stayed, at, thomas, hutchinson, s, farm, on, the, river, tees, at, sockburn, near, darlington, it, was, at, sockburn, that, coleridge, wrote, his, ballad, poem, love, addressed, to, sara, hutchinson, the, knight, mentioned, is, the, mailed, figure, on, the, conyers, tomb, in, ruined, sockburn, church, the, figure, has, a, wyvern, at, his, feet, a, reference, to, the, sockburn, worm, slain, by, sir, john, conyers, and, a, possible, source, for, lewis, carroll, s, jabberwocky, the, worm, was, supposedly, buried, under, the, rock, in, the, nearby, pasture, this, was, the, greystone, of, coleridge, s, first, draft, later, transformed, into, a, mount, the, poem, was, a, direct, inspiration, for, john, keats, famous, poem, la, belle, dame, sans, merci, coleridge, s, early, intellectual, debts, besides, german, idealists, like, kant, and, critics, like, lessing, were, first, to, william, godwin, s, political, justice, especially, during, his, pantisocratic, period, and, to, david, hartley, s, observations, on, man, which, is, the, source, of, the, psychology, which, is, found, in, frost, at, midnight, hartley, argued, that, one, becomes, aware, of, sensory, events, as, impressions, and, that, ideas, are, derived, by, noticing, similarities, and, differences, between, impressions, and, then, by, naming, them, connections, resulting, from, the, coincidence, of, impressions, create, linkages, so, that, the, occurrence, of, one, impression, triggers, those, links, and, calls, up, the, memory, of, those, ideas, with, which, it, is, associated, see, dorothy, emmet, coleridge, and, philosophy, coleridge, was, critical, of, the, literary, taste, of, his, contemporaries, and, a, literary, conservative, insofar, as, he, was, afraid, that, the, lack, of, taste, in, the, ever, growing, masses, of, literate, people, would, mean, a, continued, desecration, of, literature, in, 1800, he, returned, to, england, and, shortly, thereafter, settled, with, his, family, and, friends, in, greta, hall, at, keswick, in, the, lake, district, of, cumberland, to, be, near, grasmere, where, wordsworth, had, moved, he, stayed, with, the, wordsworths, for, eighteen, months, but, was, a, difficult, houseguest, as, his, dependency, on, laudanum, grew, and, his, frequent, nightmares, would, wake, the, children, he, was, also, a, fussy, eater, to, the, frustration, of, dorothy, wordsworth, who, had, to, cook, for, example, not, content, with, salt, coleridge, sprinkled, cayenne, pepper, on, his, eggs, which, he, ate, from, a, teacup, his, marital, problems, nightmares, illnesses, increased, opium, dependency, tensions, with, wordsworth, and, a, lack, of, confidence, in, his, poetic, powers, fuelled, the, composition, of, dejection, an, ode, and, an, intensification, of, his, philosophical, studies, in, 1802, coleridge, took, a, nine, day, walking, holiday, in, the, fells, of, the, lake, district, coleridge, is, credited, with, the, first, recorded, descent, of, scafell, to, mickledore, via, broad, stand, although, this, may, have, been, more, due, to, his, getting, lost, than, a, purposeful, new, route, he, coined, the, term, mountaineering, in, 1804, he, travelled, to, sicily, and, malta, working, for, a, time, as, acting, public, secretary, of, malta, under, the, civil, commissioner, alexander, ball, a, task, he, performed, successfully, he, lived, in, san, anton, palace, in, the, village, of, attard, he, gave, this, up, and, returned, to, england, in, 1806, dorothy, wordsworth, was, shocked, at, his, condition, upon, his, return, from, 1807, to, 1808, coleridge, returned, to, malta, and, then, travelled, in, sicily, and, italy, in, the, hope, that, leaving, britain, s, damp, climate, would, improve, his, health, and, thus, enable, him, to, reduce, his, consumption, of, opium, thomas, de, quincey, alleges, in, his, recollections, of, the, lakes, and, the, lake, poets, that, it, was, during, this, period, that, coleridge, became, a, full, blown, opium, addict, using, the, drug, as, a, substitute, for, the, lost, vigour, and, creativity, of, his, youth, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, reflects, de, quincey, s, own, experiences, more, than, coleridge, s, his, opium, addiction, he, was, using, as, much, as, two, quarts, of, laudanum, a, week, now, began, to, take, over, his, life, he, separated, from, his, wife, sara, in, 1808, quarrelled, with, wordsworth, in, 1810, lost, part, of, his, annuity, in, 1811, and, put, himself, under, the, care, of, dr, daniel, in, 1814, his, addiction, caused, severe, constipation, which, required, regular, and, humiliating, enemas, in, 1809, coleridge, made, his, second, attempt, to, become, a, newspaper, publisher, with, the, publication, of, the, journal, entitled, the, friend, it, was, a, weekly, publication, that, in, coleridge, s, typically, ambitious, style, was, written, edited, and, published, almost, entirely, single, handedly, given, that, coleridge, tended, to, be, highly, disorganised, and, had, no, head, for, business, the, publication, was, probably, doomed, from, the, start, coleridge, financed, the, journal, by, selling, over, five, hundred, subscriptions, over, two, dozen, of, which, were, sold, to, members, of, parliament, but, in, late, 1809, publication, was, crippled, by, a, financial, crisis, and, coleridge, was, obliged, to, approach, conversation, sharp, tom, poole, and, one, or, two, other, wealthy, friends, for, an, emergency, loan, to, continue, the, friend, was, an, eclectic, publication, that, drew, upon, every, corner, of, coleridge, s, remarkably, diverse, knowledge, of, law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and, literary, criticism, although, it, was, often, turgid, rambling, and, inaccessible, to, most, readers, it, ran, for, 25, issues, and, was, republished, in, book, form, a, number, of, times, years, after, its, initial, publication, a, revised, and, expanded, edition, of, the, friend, with, added, philosophical, content, including, his, essays, on, the, principles, of, method, became, a, highly, influential, work, and, its, effect, was, felt, on, writers, and, philosophers, from, john, stuart, mill, to, ralph, waldo, emerson, from, 1810, to, 1820, coleridge, gave, a, series, of, lectures, in, london, and, bristol, those, on, shakespeare, renewed, interest, in, the, playwright, as, a, model, for, contemporary, writers, much, of, coleridge, s, reputation, as, a, literary, critic, is, founded, on, the, lectures, that, he, undertook, in, the, winter, of, 1810, 11, which, were, sponsored, by, the, philosophical, institution, and, given, at, scot, s, corporation, hall, off, fetter, lane, fleet, street, these, lectures, were, heralded, in, the, prospectus, as, a, course, of, lectures, on, shakespeare, and, milton, in, illustration, of, the, principles, of, poetry, coleridge, s, ill, health, opium, addiction, problems, and, somewhat, unstable, personality, meant, that, all, his, lectures, were, plagued, with, problems, of, delays, and, a, general, irregularity, of, quality, from, one, lecture, to, the, next, as, a, result, of, these, factors, coleridge, often, failed, to, prepare, anything, but, the, loosest, set, of, notes, for, his, lectures, and, regularly, entered, into, extremely, long, digressions, which, his, audiences, found, difficult, to, follow, however, it, was, the, lecture, on, hamlet, given, on, 2, january, 1812, that, was, considered, the, best, and, has, influenced, hamlet, studies, ever, since, before, coleridge, hamlet, was, often, denigrated, and, belittled, by, critics, from, voltaire, to, dr, johnson, coleridge, rescued, the, play, s, reputation, and, his, thoughts, on, it, are, often, still, published, as, supplements, to, the, text, in, 1812, he, allowed, robert, southey, to, make, use, of, extracts, from, his, vast, number, of, private, notebooks, in, their, collaboration, omniana, or, horae, otiosiores, in, august, 1814, coleridge, was, approached, by, john, murray, lord, byron, s, publisher, about, the, possibility, of, translating, goethe, s, classic, faust, 1808, coleridge, was, regarded, by, many, as, the, greatest, living, writer, on, the, demonic, and, he, accepted, the, commission, only, to, abandon, work, on, it, after, six, weeks, until, recently, scholars, were, in, agreement, that, coleridge, never, returned, to, the, project, despite, goethe, s, own, belief, in, the, 1820s, that, he, had, in, fact, completed, a, long, translation, of, the, work, in, september, 2007, oxford, university, press, sparked, a, heated, scholarly, controversy, by, publishing, an, english, translation, of, goethe, s, work, that, purported, to, be, coleridge, s, long, lost, masterpiece, the, text, in, question, first, appeared, anonymously, in, 1821, from, 1814, to, 1816, coleridge, rented, from, a, local, surgeon, mr, page, in, calne, wiltshire, he, seemed, able, to, focus, on, his, work, and, manage, his, addiction, drafting, biographia, literaria, a, blue, plaque, marks, the, property, today, in, april, 1816, coleridge, with, his, addiction, worsening, his, spirits, depressed, and, his, family, alienated, took, residence, in, the, highgate, homes, then, just, north, of, london, of, the, physician, james, gillman, first, at, south, grove, and, later, at, the, nearby, 3, the, grove, it, is, unclear, whether, his, growing, use, of, opium, and, the, brandy, in, which, it, was, dissolved, was, a, symptom, or, a, cause, of, his, growing, depression, gillman, was, partially, successful, in, controlling, the, poet, s, addiction, coleridge, remained, in, highgate, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, the, house, became, a, place, of, literary, pilgrimage, for, writers, including, carlyle, and, emerson, in, gillman, s, home, coleridge, finished, his, major, prose, work, the, biographia, literaria, mostly, drafted, in, 1815, and, finished, in, 1817, a, volume, composed, of, 23, chapters, of, autobiographical, notes, and, dissertations, on, various, subjects, including, some, incisive, literary, theory, and, criticism, he, composed, a,

post, kantian, work, of, philosophical, synthesis, the, work, was, never, published, in, his, lifetime, and, has, frequently, been, seen, as, evidence, for, his, tendency, to, conceive, grand, projects, which, he, then, had, difficulty, in, carrying, through, to, completion, but, while, he, frequently, berated, himself, for, his, indolence, the, long, list, of, his, published, works, calls,

highgate, school, coleridge, could, see, the, red, door, of, the, then, new, church, from, his, last, residence, across, the, green, where, he, lived, with, a, doctor, he, had, hoped, might, cure,

the, most, important, figures, in, english, poetry, his, poems, directly, and, deeply, influenced, all, the, major, poets, of, the, age, he, was, known, by, his, contemporaries, as, a, meticulous, craftsman, who, was, more, rigorous, in, his, careful, reworking, of, his, poems, than, any, other, poet, and, southey, and, wordsworth, were, dependent, on, his, professional, advice, his, influence, on, wordsworth, is, particularly, important, because, many, critics, have, credited, coleridge, with, the, very, idea, of, conversational, poetry, the, idea, of, utilising, common, everyday, language, to, express, profound, poetic, images, and, ideas, for, which, wordsworth, became, so, famous, may, have, originated, almost, entirely, in, coleridge, s, mind, it, is, difficult, to, imagine, wordsworth, s, great, poems, the, excursion, or, the, prelude, ever, having, been, written, without, the, direct, influence, of, coleridge, s, originality, as, important, as, coleridge, was, to, poetry, as, a, poet, he, was, equally, important, to, poetry, as, a, critic, his, philosophy, of, poetry, which, he, developed, over, many, years, has, been, deeply, influential, in, the, field, of, literary, criticism, this, influence, can, be, seen, in, such, critics, as, a, o, lovejoy, and, i, a, richards, coleridge, is, arguably, best, known, for, his, longer, poems, particularly, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, and, christabel, even, those, who, have, never, read, the, rime, have, come, under, its, influence, its, words, have, given, the, english, language, the, metaphor, of, an, albatross, around, one, s, neck, the, quotation, of, water, water, everywhere, nor, any, drop, to, drink, almost, always, rendered, as, but, not, a, drop, to, drink, and, the, phrase, a, sadder, and, a, wiser, man, usually, rendered, as, a, sadder, but, wiser, man, the, phrase, all, creatures, great, and, small, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, rime, he, prayeth, best, who, loveth, best, all, things, both, great, and, small, for, the, dear, god, who, loveth, us, he, made, and, loveth, all, millions, more, who, have, never, read, the, poem, nonetheless, know, its, story, thanks, to, the, 1984, song, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, by, the, english, heavy, metal, band, iron, maiden, christabel, is, known, for, its, musical, rhythm, language, and, its, gothic, tale, kubla, khan, or, a, vision, in, a, dream, a, fragment, although, shorter, is, also, widely, known, both, kubla, khan, and, christabel, have, an, additional, romantic, aura, because, they, were, never, finished, stopford, brooke, characterised, both, poems, as, having, no, rival, due, to, their, exquisite, metrical, movement, and, imaginative, phrasing, the, eight, of, coleridge, s, poems, listed, above, are, now, often, discussed, as, a, group, entitled, conversation, poems, the, term, was, coined, in, 1928, by, george, mclean, harper, who, borrowed, the, subtitle, of, the, nightingale, a, conversation, poem, 1798, to, describe, the, seven, other, poems, as, well, the, poems, are, considered, by, many, critics, to, be, among, coleridge, s, finest, verses, thus, harold, bloom, has, written, with, dejection, the, ancient, mariner, and, kubla, khan, frost, at, midnight, shows, coleridge, at, his, most, impressive, they, are, also, among, his, most, influential, poems, as, discussed, further, below, harper, considered, that, the, eight, poems, represented, a, form, of, blank, verse, that, is, more, fluent, and, easy, than, milton, s, or, any, that, had, been, written, since, milton, in, 2006, robert, koelzer, wrote, about, another, aspect, of, this, apparent, easiness, noting, that, conversation, poems, such, as, coleridge, s, the, eolian, harp, and, the, nightingale, maintain, a, middle, register, of, speech, employing, an, idiomatic, language, that, is, capable, of, being, construed, as, un, symbolic, and, un, musical, language, that, lets, itself, be, taken, as, merely, talk, rather, than, rapturous, song, the, last, ten, lines, of, frost, at, midnight, were, chosen, by, harper, as, the, best, example, of, the, peculiar, kind, of, blank, verse, coleridge, had, evolved, as, natural, seeming, as, prose, but, as, exquisitely, artistic, as, the, most, complicated, sonnet, the, speaker, of, the, poem, is, addressing, his, infant, son, asleep, by, his, side, therefore, all, seasons, shall, be, sweet, to, thee, whether, the, summer, clothe, the, general, earth, with, greenness, or, the, redbreast, sit, and, sing, betwixt, the, tufts, of, snow, on, the, bare, branch, of, mossy, apple, tree, while, the, nigh, thatch, smokes, in, the, sun, thaw, whether, the, eave, drops, fall, heard, only, in, the, trances, of, the, blast, or, if, the, secret, ministry, of, frost, shall, hang, them, up, in, silent, icicles, quietly, shining, to, the, quiet, moon, in, 1965, m, h, abrams, wrote, a, broad, description, that, applies, to, the, conversation, poems, the, speaker, begins, with, a, description, of, the, landscape, an, aspect, or, change, of, aspect, in, the, landscape, evokes, a, varied, by, integral, process, of, memory, thought, anticipation, and, feeling, which, remains, closely, intervolved, with, the, outer, scene, in, the, course, of, this, meditation, the, lyric, speaker, achieves, an, insight, faces, up, to, a, tragic, loss, comes, to, a, moral, decision, or, resolves, an, emotional, problem, often, the, poem, rounds, itself, to, end, where, it, began, at, the, outer, scene, but, with, an, altered, mood, and, deepened, understanding, which, is, the, result, of, the, intervening, meditation, in, fact, abrams, was, describing, both, the, conversation, poems, and, later, poems, influenced, by, them, abrams, essay, has, been, called, a, touchstone, of, literary, criticism, as, paul, magnuson, described, it, in, 2002, abrams, credited, coleridge, with, originating, what, abrams, called, the, greater, romantic, lyric, a, genre, that, began, with, coleridge, s, conversation, poems, and, included, wordsworth, s, tintern, abbey, shelley, s, stanzas, written, in, dejection, and, keats, s, ode, to, a, nightingale, and, was, a, major, influence, on, more, modern, lyrics, by, matthew, arnold, walt, whitman, wallace, stevens, and, w, h, auden, in, addition, to, his, poetry, coleridge, also, wrote, influential, pieces, of, literary, criticism, including, biographia, literaria, a, collection, of, his, thoughts, and, opinions, on, literature, which, he, published, in, 1817, the, work, delivered, both, biographical, explanations, of, the, author, s, life, as, well, as, his, impressions, on, literature, the, collection, also, contained, an, analysis, of, a, broad, range, of, philosophical, principles, of, literature, ranging, from, aristotle, to, immanuel, kant, and, schelling, and, applied, them, to, the, poetry, of, peers, such, as, william, wordsworth, coleridge, s, explanation, of, metaphysical, principles, were, popular, topics, of, discourse, in, academic, communities, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, and, t, s, eliot, stated, that, he, believed, that, coleridge, was, perhaps, the, greatest, of, english, critics, and, in, a, sense, the, last, eliot, suggests, that, coleridge, displayed, natural, abilities, far, greater, than, his, contemporaries, dissecting, literature, and, applying, philosophical, principles, of, metaphysics, in, a, way, that, brought, the, subject, of, his, criticisms, away, from, the, text, and, into, a, world, of, logical, analysis, that, mixed, logical, analysis, and, emotion, however, eliot, also, criticises, coleridge, for, allowing, his, emotion, to, play, a, role, in, the, metaphysical, process, believing, that, critics, should, not, have, emotions, that, are, provoked, by, the, work, being, studied, hugh, kenner, in, historical, fictions, discusses, norman, fruman, s, coleridge, the, damaged, archangel, and, suggests, that, the, term, criticism, is, too, often, applied, to, biographia, literaria, which, both, he, and, fruman, describe, as, having, failed, to, explain, or, help, the, reader, understand, works, of, art, to, kenner, coleridge, s, attempt, to, discuss, complex, philosophical, concepts, without, describing, the, rational, process, behind, them, displays, a, lack, of, critical, thinking, that, makes, the, volume, more, of, a, biography, than, a, work, of, criticism, in, biographia, literaria, and, his, poetry, symbols, are, not, merely, objective, correlatives, to, coleridge, but, instruments, for, making, the, universe, and, personal, experience, intelligible, and, spiritually, covalent, to, coleridge, the, cinque, spotted, spider, making, its, way, upstream, by, fits, and, starts, is, not, merely, a, comment, on, the, intermittent, nature, of, creativity, imagination, or, spiritual, progress, but, the, journey, and, destination, of, his, life, the, spider, s, five, legs, represent, the, central, problem, that, coleridge, lived, to, resolve, the, conflict, between, aristotelian, logic, and, christian, philosophy, two, legs, of, the, spider, represent, the, me, not, me, of, thesis, and, antithesis, the, idea, that, a, thing, cannot, be, itself, and, its, opposite, simultaneously, the, basis, of, the, clockwork, newtonian, world, view, that, coleridge, rejected, the, remaining, three, legs, exothesis, mesothesis, and, synthesis, or, the, holy, trinity, represent, the, idea, that, things, can, diverge, without, being, contradictory, taken, together, the, five, legs, with, synthesis, in, the, center, form, the, holy, cross, of, ramist, logic, the, cinque, spotted, spider, is, coleridge, s, emblem, of, holism, the, quest, and, substance, of, coleridge, s, thought, and, spiritual, life, coleridge, wrote, reviews, of, ann, radcliffe, s, books, and, the, mad, monk, among, others, he, comments, in, his, reviews, situations, of, torment, and, images, of, naked, horror, are, easily, conceived, and, a, writer, in, whose, works, they, abound, deserves, our, gratitude, almost, equally, with, him, who, should, drag, us, by, way, of, sport, through, a, military, hospital, or, force, us, to, sit, at, the, dissecting, table, of, a, natural, philosopher, to, trace, the, nice, boundaries, beyond, which, terror, and, sympathy, are, deserted, by, the, pleasurable, emotions, to, reach, those, limits, yet, never, to, pass, them, hic, labor, hic, opus, est, and, the, horrible, and, the, preternatural, have, usually, seized, on, the, popular, taste, at, the, rise, and, decline, of, literature, most, powerful, stimulants, they, can, never, be, required, except, by, the, torpor, of, an, unawakened, or, the, languor, of, an, exhausted, appetite, we, trust, however, that, satiety, will, banish, what, good, sense, should, have, prevented, and, that, wearied, with, fiends, incomprehensible, characters, with, shrieks, murders, and, subterraneous, dungeons, the, public, will, learn, by, the, multitude, of, the, manufacturers, with, how, little, expense, of, thought, or, imagination, this, species, of, composition, is, manufactured, however, coleridge, used, these, elements, in, poems, such, as, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, 1798, christabel, and, kubla, khan, published, in, 1816, but, known, in, manuscript, form, before, then, and, certainly, influenced, other, poets, and, writers, of, the, time, poems, like, these, both, drew, inspiration, from, and, helped, to, inflame, the, craze, for, gothic, romance, coleridge, also, made, considerable, use, of, gothic, elements, in, his, commercially, successful, play, remorse, mary, shelley, who, knew, coleridge, well, mentions, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, twice, directly, in, frankenstein, and, some, of, the, descriptions, in, the, novel, echo, it, indirectly, although, william, godwin, her, father, disagreed, with, coleridge, on, some, important, issues, he, respected, his, opinions, and, coleridge, often, visited, the, godwins, mary, shelley, later, recalled, hiding, behind, the, sofa, and, hearing, his, voice, chanting, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, c, s, lewis, also, makes, mention, of, his, name, in, the, screwtape, letters, as, a, poor, example, of, prayer, in, which, the, devils, should, encourage, defunct, his, father, was, an, anglican, vicar, and, though, coleridge, worked, as, a, unitarian, preacher, from, 1796, to, 1797, he, eventually, returned, to, the, church, of, england, in, 1814, his, most, noteworthy, writings, on, religion, are, lay, sermons, 1817, aids, to, reflection, 1825, and, the, constitution, of, church, and, state, 1830, despite, being, mostly, remembered, today, for, his, poetry, and, literary, criticism, coleridge, was, also, a, theologian, his, writings, include, discussions, of, the, status, of, scripture, the, doctrines, of, the, fall, justification, and, sanctification, and, the, personality, and, infinity, of, god, a, major, figure, in, the, anglican, theology, of, his, day, his, writings, are, still, regularly, referred, to, by, contemporary, anglican, theologians, f, d,

thinker, early, in, life, he, was, a, political, radical, and, an, enthusiast, for, the, french, revolution, however, he, subsequently, developed, a, more, conservative, view, of, society, somewhat, in, the, manner, of, edmund, burke, he, was, critical, of, the, french, constitution, of, 1799, adopted, following, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, which, he, regarded, as, oligarchic, although, seen, as, cowardly, treachery, by, the, next, generation, of, romantic, poets, coleridge, s, later, thought, became, a, fruitful, source, for, the, evolving, radicalism, of, j, s, mill, mill, found, three,
