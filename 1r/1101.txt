to, confucian, principles, of, succession, should, have, been, crown, prince, as, she, believed, that, li, longji, was, young, 25, at, the, time, he, was, made, crown, prince, and, would, be, easy, to, control, however, once, she, began, to, see, that, li, longji, was, strong, willed, and, criticized, her, influences, she, became, apprehensive, and, often, had, officials, close, to, her, publicly, opine, that, li, longji, was, an, improper, crown, prince, she, even, spread, rumors, throughout, the, empire, and, tried, to, cause, discontent, among, the, common, people, saying, li,

faults, with, him, she, associated, with, a, group, of, officials, including, the, chancellors, dou, huaizhen, xiao, zhizhong, and, cen, xi, intending, to, find, some, way, to, remove, li, longji, but, was, unable, to, get, two, other, chancellors, wei, anshi, and, song, jing, to, join, her, group, when, princess, taiping, tried, to, depose, li, longji, in, two, actions, one, with, emperor, ruizong, himself, and, another, time, by, summoning, the, chancellors, at, xuanwu, gate, and, publicly, accusing, li, longji, of, treason, or, incompetence, but, it, did, not, achieve, the, desired, result, in, 711, song, and, another, chancellor, yao, yuanzhi, tried, to, persuade, emperor, ruizong, to, carry, out, a, plan, that, they, believed, would, end, her, plotting, and, influence, they, proposed, that, the, two, princes, who, arguably, had, superior, claims, on, the, throne, than, li, longji, li, chengqi, and, li, shouli, whose, father, li, xian, note, different, character, than, emperor, zhongzong, was, an, older, brother, to, both, emperors, zhongzong, and, ruizong, be, sent, out, of, the, capital, chang, an, to, serve, as, prefectural, prefects, while, princess, taiping, and, wu, youji, be, sent, to, live, in, luoyang, they, also, proposed, that, li, longji, be, put, in, charge, of, most, affairs, of, state, emperor, ruizong, initially, agreed, and, made, the, orders, as, song, and, yao, suggested, except, that, he, believed, that, luoyang, was, too, far, and, therefore, sent, princess, taiping, and, wu, youji, only, to, pu, prefecture, roughly, modern, yuncheng, shanxi, after, princess, taiping, found, out, that, the, plan, was, conceived, by, song, and, yao, however, she, was, incensed, and, let, li, longji, know, her, anger, and, she, mobilized, her, group, to, attack, song, and, yao, and, oppose, emperor, ruizong, s, decision, in, fear, li, longji, submitted, a, petition, accusing, song, and, yao, of, alienating, him, from, his, brothers, li, chengqi,

princess, and, emperor, xuanzong, agreeing, to, the, proposal, in, 716, however, qapaghan, was, killed, in, battle, against, the, bayegu, and, from, that, point, on, lacking, his, efficient, leadership, the, g, kt, rks, while, remaining, an, important, regional, power, posed, much, less, of, a, threat, to, china, although, at, times, still, capable, of, dealing, serious, defeats, to, tang, forces, as, was, the, case, in, 720, when, the, g, kt, rk, general, tonyukuk, defeated, the, tang, garrison, at, liang, prefecture, roughly, modern, wuwei, gansu, and, the, tang, vassal, basmyl, meanwhile, tang, the, tibetan, empire, and, the, umayyad, caliphate, were, constantly, engaging, in, a, three, way, tug, of, war, for, influence, in, the, xiyu, i, e, modern, xinjiang, and, former, soviet, central, asia, region, in, 715, for, example, when, the, king, of, bahanna, was, expelled, by, a, new, king, supported, by, the, tibetan, empire, and, the, umayyad, caliphate, tang, forces, commanded, by, the, general, zhang, xiaosong, attacked, the, new, king, and, restored, the, old, king, general, tang, jiahui, led, the, chinese, to, defeat, the, following, arab, tibetan, attack, in, the, battle, of, aksu, 717, the, attack, on, aksu, was, joined, by, turgesh, khan, suluk, both, uch, turfan, and, aksu, were, attacked, by, the, turgesh, arab, and, tibetan, force, on, 15, august, 717, qarluqs, serving, under, chinese, command, under, arsila, xian, a, western, turkic, qaghan, serving, under, the, chinese, assistant, grand, protector, general, tang, jiahui, defeated, the, attack, al, yashkuri, the, arab, commander, and, his, army, fled, to, tashkent, after, they, were, defeated, in, and, around, 716, there, was, a, major, locust, infestation, in, the, central, china, region, at, yao, s, suggestion, emperor, xuanzong, ordered, an, extensive, campaign, of, extermination, which, was, said, to, reduce, the, impact, of, the, infestation, and, ward, off, a, major, famine, later, in, 716, however, due, a, corruption, scandal, involving, yao, s, sons, and, his, associate, zhao, hui, yao, incurred, displeasure, from, emperor, xuanzong, and, offered, to, resign, he, and, yuan, qianyao, who, replaced, lu, after, lu, s, death, earlier, in, 716, were, removed, from, their, offices, and, replaced, with, song, jing, and, su, ting, with, song, making, more, of, the, important, decisions, and, su, assisting, yao, would, not, return, to, the, chancellorship, but, would, remain, influential, as, a, key, advisor, for, emperor, xuanzong, until, yao, s, death, in, 721, contrary, to, the, practical, and, flexible, yao, song, was, more, interested, in, emphasizing, integrity, and, rule, of, law, in, governance, and, it, was, said, that, while, yao, s, and, song, s, emphases, were, different, they, were, both, regarded, as, instrumental, in, establishing, the, rule, of, kaiyuan, and, that, subsequent, chancellors, could, not, compare, to, them, meanwhile, song, and, su, had, carried, out, a, stern, campaign, against, the, use, of, coins, that, were, not, officially, forged, by, the, government, which, brought, popular, resentment, that, emperor, xuanzong, found, problematic, in, 720, he, removed, song, and, su, from, chancellor, offices, and, replaced, them, with, yuan, and, zhang, jiazhen, and, in, 721, added, zhang, yue, as, a, chancellor, as, well, meanwhile, by, 722, empress, wang, who, had, contributed, to, emperor, xuanzong, s, reign, by, providing, suggestions, had, begun, to, lose, favor, to, consort, wu, a, great, grandniece, of, emperor, xuanzong, s, grandmother, wu, zetian, emperor, xuanzong, secretly, discussed, with, jiang, jiao, the, possibility, of, deposing, her, but, jiang, jiao, careless, leaked, the, discussion, at, the, urging, of, zhang, jiazhen, who, was, friendly, with, empress, wang, s, brother, wang, shouyi, advocated, that, jiang, jiao, be, punished, and, exiled, and, jiang, died, in, exile, meanwhile, at, zhang, yue, s, suggestion, the, tang, northern, border, defense, forces, which, had, about, 600, 000, men, at, that, time, was, reduced, by, 200, 000, men, to, allow, the, soldiers, to, return, home, further, seeing, that, the, tang, conscription, system, due, to, abuses, against, the, soldiers, at, the, time, was, near, a, collapse, as, the, soldiers, were, forced, into, long, tours, of, duty, but, their, families, were, not, exempt, from, taxes, thus, causing, great, numbers, of, desertions, zhang, suggested, a, switch, to, a, recruitment, based, system, where, soldiers, were, paid, salaries, this, allowed, for, a, time, tang, s, soldier, supply, to, be, replenished, some, later, historians, condemned, zhang, for, the, abolition, of, the, conscription, system, believing, the, abolition, to, be, the, root, of, tang, s, later, fracturing, but, some, others, such, as, the, modern, historian, bo, yang, argued, that, zhang, s, actions, not, only, were, necessary, to, restore, the, supply, of, soldiers, but, saved, many, lives, in, 723, zhang, jiazhen, was, demoted, on, account, of, a, corruption, scandal, involving, his, brother, zhang, jiayou, his, position, was, filled, by, wang, jun, who, was, soon, himself, demoted, over, suspicions, never, proven, that, he, was, plotting, treason, with, zhang, yue, thus, effectively, being, the, senior, chancellor, zhang, yue, promoted, literary, studies, which, emperor, xuanzong, also, favored, in, 724, he, also, commissioned, the, chief, imperial, astronomer, nangong, shuo, to, carry, out, a, major, astronomical, survey, to, observe, the, sun, and, the, north, star, at, various, points, of, the, empire, also, in, 724, it, was, discovered, that, wang, shouyi, had, engaged, sorcerers, to, make, amulets, for, empress, wang, to, wear, hoping, that, the, use, of, magic, would, allow, her, to, have, a, son, empress, wang, was, deposed, and, reduced, to, commoner, rank, while, wang, shouyi, was, exiled, and, subsequently, ordered, to, commit, suicide, in, exile, empress, wang, died, later, in, the, year, and, it, was, said, that, the, eunuchs, and, the, ladies, in, waiting, mourned, her, bitterly, and, emperor, xuanzong, much, regretted, his, treatment, of, her, still, after, empress, wang, s, removal, and, death, consort, wu, became, undisputed, mistress, of, the, palace, and, was, treated, inside, the, palace, like, an, empress, would, be, still, in, 726, when, emperor, xuanzong, considered, creating, her, empress, he, encountered, oppositions, from, officials, on, two, grounds, that, her, wu, clan, was, hated, by, the, people, and, that, as, she, had, her, own, sons, the, position, of, li, siqian, the, crown, prince, whose, name, had, been, changed, to, li, hong, by, this, point, would, be, threatened, as, a, result, emperor, xuanzong, never, created, her, empress, but, consort, wu, s, was, a, chief, favorite, of, the, emperor, and, undisputed, mistress, of, the, palace, until, her, death, and, had, political, power, in, winter, 725, emperor, xuanzong, at, zhang, yue, s, urging, carried, out, a, magnificent, ceremony, at, mount, tai, to, offer, sacrifices, to, heaven, and, earth, on, 11, may, 726, zhang, yue, was, accused, of, corruption, by, several, officials, that, he, had, blocked, the, advances, of, cui, yinfu, yuwen, rong, and, li, linfu, and, was, found, to, have, committed, corruption, at, the, intercession, of, gao, lishi, however, zhang, yue, was, removed, only, from, his, chancellor, post, on, 18, may, and, permitted, to, maintain, his, title, and, a, number, of, other, posts, he, was, replaced, by, li, yuanhong, on, 15, may, and, subsequently, du, xian, was, also, added, as, a, chancellor, in, 727, at, the, suggestion, of, the, general, wang, junchuo, emperor, xuanzong, commissioned, wang, junchuo, to, attack, the, tibetan, empire, and, after, a, tibetan, incursion, in, late, 726, wang, counterattacked, and, inflicted, losses, on, tibetan, forces, commanded, by, the, general, xinuoluogonglu, later, in, the, year, though, xinuoluogonglu, and, another, general, zhulongmangbuzhi, attacked, and, captured, wang, s, home, prefecture, gua, prefecture, roughly, modern, jiuquan, gansu, taking, wang, s, father, wang, shou, captive, as, a, result, wang, junchuo, did, not, dare, to, counterattack, and, subsequently, blamed, the, defeat, on, a, number, of, tribal, chiefs, in, the, area, and, had, them, exiles, in, response, yaoluoge, hushu, the, nephew, of, one, of, the, chiefs, so, exiled, yaoluoge, chengzong, ambushed, wang, junchuo, and, killed, him, and, while, yaoluoge, hushu, was, forced, to, flee, thereafter, for, several, years, tang, did, not, engage, in, any, offensive, campaigns, in, the, region, around, the, same, time, emperor, xuanzong, began, to, build, a, residential, complex, in, the, palace, for, imperial, clan, members, known, as, the, mansion, of, the, ten, princes, to, centralize, their, residence, thereafter, imperial, princes, including, the, crown, prince, would, rarely, live, outside, the, palace, complex, on, 6, december, 728, emperor, xuanzong, added, the, general, xiao, song, as, a, chancellor, subsequently, in, 729, with, yuan, even, though, he, was, senior, chancellor, unable, to, curb, the, disputes, between, li, yuanhong, and, du, emperor, xuanzong, removed, all, three, from, chancellor, positions, promoting, yuwen, and, pei, guangting, to, be, chancellors, in, their, stead, in, yuwen, s, case, for, his, abilities, to, find, ways, to, add, to, the, imperial, treasury, by, imposing, special, taxes, and, levies, later, in, the, year, though, yuwen, made, false, accusations, against, the, general, li, hui, the, prince, of, xin, an, emperor, xuanzong, s, second, cousin, and, was, exiled, and, subsequently, died, in, exile, still, it, was, said, that, it, was, starting, from, yuwen, s, times, that, emperor, xuanzong, began, to, pay, attention, on, taxes, to, replenish, the, imperial, treasury, which, traditional, historians, viewed, as, the, start, of, his, inflicting, financial, burdens, on, the, people, further, with, pei, in, charge, of, the, civil, service, system, it, was, said, that, due, to, pei, s, strict, adherence, to, seniority, the, tang, civil, service, system, began, to, lose, its, ability, to, find, talented, people, to, serve, in, offices, in, 730, the, khitan, general, ketugan, killed, the, king, li, shaogu, and, took, over, the, reign, of, the, khitan, and, the, xi, personally, forcing, the, king, of, the, xi, li, lusu, to, flee, to, tang, for, protection, tang, sent, an, army, to, attack, the, khitan, but, meanwhile, made, peace, with, the, tibetan, empire, initially, the, campaign, against, the, khitan, did, not, succeed, but, in, 732, with, li, hui, in, command, tang, forces, dealt, ketugan, a, serious, defeat, and, causing, many, of, ketugan, s, subordinates, to, defect, and, submit, to, tang, although, ketugan, was, not, captured, meanwhile, tang, also, began, to, have, periodic, conflicts, with, balhae, and, in, 733, emperor, xuanzong, tried, to, commission, dae, mun, ye, the, brother, of, balhae, s, king, mu, to, attack, balhae, along, with, forces, from, silla, but, the, attack, was, not, successful, also, in, 733, pei, guangting, died, and, at, the, recommendation, of, xiao, song, he, was, replaced, with, han, xiu, but, soon, song, and, han, were, in, repeated, conflicts, and, late, in, 733, both, were, removed, and, replaced, with, pei, yaoqing, who, became, known, for, improving, the, food, distribution, system, and, zhang, jiuling, known, for, his, integrity, in, 734, emperor, xuanzong, added, li, linfu, a, close, associate, of, consort, wu, as, a, chancellor, as, well, around, the, new, year, 735, ketuhan, was, killed, in, an, internal, khitan, power, struggle, and, khitan, became, a, vassal, again, although, it, would, not, stay, so, permanently, by, 736, emperor, xuanzong, was, described, as, having, been, tired, of, important, affairs, of, state, and, beginning, to, become, wasteful, and, exuberant, in, his, lifestyle, zhang, tried, to, curb, his, behavior, but, thus, began, to, lose, favor, while, li, linfu, was, gaining, power, due, to, his, association, with, consort, wu, further, zhang, supported, li, hong, whose, name, had, been, changed, to, li, ying, by, this, point, while, li, linfu, and, consort, wu, supported, her, son, li, mao, the, prince, of, shou, and, tried, to, have, li, mao, made, crown, prince, in, 736, due, to, li, linfu, s, machinations, that, made, emperor, xuanzong, believed, that, zhang, and, pei, yaoqing, were, improperly, engaging, in, factionalism, zhang, and, pei, yaoqing, were, removed, and, replaced, by, niu, xianke, who, closely, followed, li, linfu, s, will, and, thereafter, li, linfu, would, dominate, the, imperial, government, almost, to, the, end, of, emperor, xuanzong, s, reign, li, linfu, did, all, he, could, to, stay, in, power, and, carried, out, many, dirty, tricks, against, actual, or, potential, threats, to, his, power, he, also, severely, discouraged, criticism, ending, the, relative, freedom, that, officials, had, to, make, proposals, to, emperor, xuanzong, this, was, often, viewed, by, traditional, historians, as, the, turning, point, of, emperor, xuanzong, s, reign, which, up, to, that, point, was, considered, a, golden, age, in, chinese, history, toward, a, path, of, degeneration, the, song, dynasty, historian, sima, guang, in, his, zizhi, tongjian, for, example, commented, of, the, chancellors, that, the, emperor, commissioned, after, he, took, the, throne, yao, chong, emphasized, flexibility, song, jing, emphasized, the, rule, of, law, zhang, jiazhen, emphasized, administrative, abilities, zhang, shuo, emphasized, literary, talent, li, yuanhong, and, du, xian, emphasized, frugality, and, han, xiu, and, zhang, jiuling, emphasized, honesty, all, of, them, had, their, different, talents, after, zhang, jiuling, was, demoted, however, the, officials, were, all, concerned, about, keeping, their, positions, and, honest, words, no, longer, had, a, place, in, government, in, 737, with, zhang, no, longer, in, the, government, to, protect, him, li, ying, was, deposed, and, subsequently, forced, to, commit, suicide, however, with, consort, wu, dying, later, in, the, year, emperor, xuanzong, did, not, immediately, accept, li, linfu, s, proposal, to, have, li, mao, made, crown, prince, rather, he, chose, an, older, son, li, yu, the, prince, of, zhong, in, 738, historians, said, that, emperor, xuanzong, forced, tens, of, thousands, of, beautiful, women, to, live, in, his, palace, to, please, him, more, than, many, other, tang, emperors, and, he, did, not, allow, many, to, be, set, free, even, when, they, were, old, as, emperor, xuanzong, turned, his, attention, to, pleasure, seeking, with, his, favorite, concubine, yang, guifei, and, her, family, he, paid, less, and, less, attention, to, the, running, of, his, empire, and, much, of, his, power, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, corrupt, li, linfu, who, was, succeeded, by, lady, yang, s, dissolute, cousin, yang, guozhong, and, the, eunuch, gao, lishi, at, the, same, time, 751, saw, the, loss, of, the, battle, of, talas, against, the, abbasid, caliphate, as, a, consequence, the, tang, dynasty, temporarily, lost, some, of, its, influence, in, central, asia, to, the, emerging, abbasid, caliphate, as, several, tang, tributaries, turned, to, the, abbasids, meanwhile, the, jiedushi, military, governors, most, of, whom, were, non, han, took, more, and, more, regional, power, into, their, own, hands, some, successful, generals, included, geshu, han, known, for, victories, over, the, tibetan, empire, gao, xianzhi, who, conquered, city, states, of, the, xiyu, region, eventually, battling, the, abbasids, at, talas, and, an, lushan, who, defeated, and, once, again, vassalized, the, khitan, eventually, in, 755, an, lushan, started, the, anshi, rebellion, at, fanyang, the, rebels, quickly, seized, the, eastern, capital, luoyang, and, then, the, imperial, capital, chang, an, six, months, later, emperor, xuanzong, fled, to, sichuan, during, the, war, and, abdicated, the, throne, to, li, yu, whose, name, had, been, changed, to, li, heng, at, that, point, as, emperor, suzong, meanwhile, at, li, linfu, s, encouragement, emperor, xuanzong, began, to, promote, non, han, generals, to, command, large, border, armies, believing, li, linfu, s, assertion, that, non, han, generals, were, more, likely, to, be, personally, loyal, to, emperor, xuanzong, himself, and, would, not, have, clan, entanglements, even, though, li, linfu, s, own, personal, motivation, was, to, prevent, han, officials, from, going, through, the, border, command, route, to, become, chancellors, thus, threatening, him, such, generals, who, rose, in, ranks, included, an, lushan, an, sishun, geshu, han, and, gao, xianzhi, by, 742, the, main, tang, forces, were, all, concentrated, on, the, border, at, nine, different, military, circuits, and, one, special, military, district, lingnan, as, well, as, three, special, coast, defense, districts, changle, donglai, and, dongmou, meanwhile, it, was, said, that, emperor, xuanzong, had, paid, less, attention, to, increasing, revenues, after, yuwen, rong, s, fall, but, by, 742, he, was, again, interested, in, doing, so, and, such, officials, as, wei, jian, a, brother, in, law, of, li, yu, whose, name, was, changed, by, this, point, to, li, heng, wang, hong, and, yang, shenjin, became, favored, and, often, matters, having, to, do, with, finances, were, stripped, out, of, other, officials, responsibilities, and, given, to, them, as, special, commissions, late, in, 742, niu, xianke, died, and, was, replaced, by, li, shizhi, in, 744, eastern, tujue, after, a, series, of, internal, turmoil, and, rebellions, from, its, vassals, finally, collapsed, its, vassal, huige, rose, and, became, the, dominant, power, of, the, region, but, formally, submitted, to, tang, as, a, vassal, meanwhile, after, consort, wu, s, death, emperor, xuanzong, had, been, depressed, when, he, saw, his, son, prince, of, shou, li, mao, s, wife, his, daughter, in, law, yang, yuhuan, princess, of, shou, by, virtue, of, marriage, he, was, infatuated, with, her, and, he, had, her, become, a, taoist, nun, and, gave, li, mao, the, wife, of, the, general, wei, zhaoxun, as, his, new, wife, and, princess, meanwhile, he, secretly, took, the, nun, yang, into, the, palace, she, became, his, senior, ranking, concubine, guifei, known, as, yang, guifei, and, soon, became, so, powerful, that, officials, were, bribing, her, family, members, to, get, preferential, treatment, she, was, referred, to, inside, the, palace, as, the, lady, and, treated, like, an, empress, as, was, consort, wu, until, her, death, he, abducted, more, than, 40000, women, in, his, palace, some, were, not, set, free, even, after, they, were, over, 60, years, old, meanwhile, li, linfu, was, beginning, to, conflict, with, li, shizhi, and, wei, jian, who, were, allies, li, linfu, who, engaged, a, group, of, secret, police, officials, to, investigate, and, manufacture, evidence, against, political, enemies, was, able, to, get, wei, and, li, shizhi, demoted, and, exiled, in, 746, li, shizhi, was, replaced, by, chen, xilie, who, gained, favor, from, emperor, xuanzong, for, his, knowledge, in, taoism, and, sorcery, in, 747, li, linfu, further, carried, out, a, campaign, of, terror, against, exiled, officials, and, among, the, officials, executed, were, wei, li, yong, and, pei, dunfu, li, shizhi, and, wang, ju, who, had, been, instrumental, in, emperor, xuanzong, s, initial, actions, against, princess, taiping, committed, suicide, meanwhile, in, 747, emperor, xuanzong, wanted, to, expand, the, government, s, talent, pool, and, so, issued, an, edict, ordering, that, the, people, who, had, unusual, talents, to, come, to, chang, an, to, be, examined, by, himself, li, linfu, fearing, that, these, examinees, might, accuse, him, of, improprieties, when, they, get, to, meet, the, emperor, suggested, that, these, examinees, go, through, two, levels, of, preliminary, examinations, by, the, local, governments, and, then, by, the, executive, bureau, as, a, result, no, one, passed, the, first, two, levels, of, preliminary, examinations, and, li, linfu, subsequently, submitted, a, note, to, emperor, xuanzong, congratulating, him, that, no, talent, has, been, overlooked, by, the, imperial, administration, meanwhile, also, as, of, 747, an, lushan, had, become, greatly, favored, by, emperor, xuanzong, due, to, his, military, achievements, and, his, willingness, to, flatter, emperor, xuanzong, consort, yang, and, her, family, members, further, li, linfu, apprehensive, about, the, general, wang, zhongsi, who, at, that, time, was, in, command, of, four, circuits, hexi, longyou, shuofang, and, hedong, deprecated, wang, in, favor, of, an, lushan, in, 747, after, li, linfu, implicated, wang, in, hindering, a, campaign, against, the, tibetan, empire, and, further, accused, wang, of, plotting, a, coup, to, overthrow, emperor, xuanzong, and, replace, him, with, li, heng, wang, was, arrested, and, demoted, escaping, death, only, at, the,

circuits, was, also, given, hedong, and, thereafter, was, in, command, of, the, most, elite, troops, of, the, empire, meanwhile, the, ethnically, goguryeo, general, gao, xianzhi, had, become,

all, households, in, chang, an, it, was, also, said, that, by, 749, the, empire, was, so, wealthy, that, emperor, xuanzong, viewed, treasures, as, expendable, and, so, awarded, them, without, limit, meanwhile, li, linfu, had, a, tight, grip, on, power, and, favors, from, emperor, xuanzong, throughout, the, years, but, as, of, 750, yang, guozhong, and, chen, xilie, had, allied, with, each, other, and, were, finding, ways, to, eliminate, li, linfu, s, allies, from, government, as, of, 751, tang, was, also, facing, defeats, on, two, different, external, fronts, as, nanzhao, s, king, geluofeng,

complicit, in, the, rebellion, of, another, general, li, xianzhong, li, linfu, was, posthumously, disgraced, and, his, family, was, exiled, a, rivalry, soon, developed, between, yang, guozhong, and, an, lushan, and, yang, guozhong, began, to, repeatedly, warn, emperor, xuanzong, that, an, was, plotting, rebellion, emperor, xuanzong, ignored, the, warnings, in, 754, yang, guozhong, suggested, that, if, an, were, summoned, to, the, capital, he, would, surely, refuse, and, emperor, xuanzong, decided, to, try, an, and, an, arrived, in, chang, an, immediately, after, being, summoned, after, this, incident, emperor, xuanzong, no, longer, believed, that, an, was, plotting, rebellion, nevertheless, because, of, yang, guozhong, s, opposition, he, did, not, make, an, chancellor, as, he, was, planning, also, in, 754, with, yang, guozhong, also, trying, to, squeeze, chen, out, of, the, government, chen, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, wei, jiansu, in, 755, yang, guozhong, further,

rebelled, in, winter, 755, and, quickly, reached, and, captured, luoyang, after, defeating, feng, changqing, s, undersupplied, army, subsequently, emperor, xuanzong, believing, in, reports, from, the, eunuch, bian, lingcheng, that, feng, was, cowardly, and, that, feng, s, superior, gao, xianzhi, was, corrupt, executed, both, feng, and, gao, and, replaced, gao, with, geshu, in, defending, tong, pass, from, an, s, advances, an, declared, himself, emperor, of, a, new, state, of, yan, at, luoyang, but, with, geshu, defending, tong, pass, an, s, advances, stalled, while, tang, forces, commanded, by, li, guangbi, and, guo, ziyi, made, advances, against, an, controlled, territory, north, of, the, yellow, river, meanwhile, though, yang, guozhong, fearing, that, geshu, had, designs, against, him, convinced, emperor, xuanzong, to, order, geshu, to, attack, despite, geshu, s, warnings, that, doing, so, was, risky, geshu, was, subsequently, defeated, by, an, s, forward, commander, cui, qianyou, and, tong, pass, fell, with, an, s, forces, advancing, on, chang, an, on, 14, july, 756, emperor, xuanzong, with, yang, guozhong, suggesting, that, they, flee, to, jiannan, circuit, abandoned, chang, an, and, fled, with, gao, lishi, yang, guozhong, wei, li, heng, consort, yang, and, her, family, the, following, day, 15, july, the, imperial, guards, accompanying, the, emperor, angry, at, yang, guozhong, rose, and, killed, him, and, forced, emperor, xuanzong, to, kill, consort, yang, as, well, subsequently, emperor, xuanzong, continued, on, to, jiannan, but, li, heng, did, not, but, rather, went, to, lingwu, where, on, 12, august, li, heng, was, declared, emperor, as, emperor, suzong, meanwhile, without, knowledge, that, emperor, suzong, had, claimed, the, throne, emperor, xuanzong, while, still, on, his, way, to, chengdu, the, capital, of, jiannan, circuit, issued, an, edict, that, gave, several, of, his, sons, various, responsibility, areas, under, li, heng, s, command, overall, until, this, edict, was, issued, most, of, the, realm, only, knew, that, chang, an, had, fallen, and, had, not, known, where, emperor, xuanzong, had, fled, when, the, news, of, emperor, suzong, s, ascension, reached, emperor, xuanzong, at, chengdu, on, 10, september, he, recognized, emperor, suzong, as, the, new, emperor, and, thereafter, took, the, title, of, taishang, huang, retired, emperor, although, his, edict, recognizing, emperor, suzong, appeared, to, still, indicate, desire, to, retain, control, like, his, father, emperor, ruizong, did, early, in, his, reign, from, now, on, my, edicts, chi, shall, be, referred, to, as, gao, and, submissions, to, me, shall, address, me, as, taishang, huang, all, matters, relating, to, the, military, or, the, state, throughout, the, realm, shall, first, be, submitted, to, the, emperor, before, being, submitted, to, me, after, the, capital, is, recaptured, i, will, no, longer, oversee, the, affairs, of, state, however, perhaps, to, avoid, the, impression, that, he, was, keeping, a, rival, government, to, emperor, suzong, he, sent, the, several, chancellors, that, he, had, retained, or, created, while, on, the, journey, to, or, after, he, arrived, in, chengdu, wei, fang, guan, and, cui, huan, to, lingwu, to, formally, invest, imperial, power, on, emperor, suzong, and, to, serve, under, emperor, suzong, emperor, xuanzong, after, becoming, retired, emperor, largely, allowed, emperor, suzong, to, coordinate, the, campaign, against, yan, but, at, times, nevertheless, stepped, in, to, make, decisions, for, example, in, spring, 757, apparently, without, first, consulting, emperor, suzong, he, named, li, lin, chancellor, although, he, subsequently, sent, both, li, lin, and, another, chancellor, cui, yuan, whom, he, had, not, sent, to, emperor, suzong, previously, to, emperor, suzong, he, also, posthumously, honored, emperor, suzong, s, mother, consort, yang, not, yang, yuhuan, as, an, empress,

himself, after, emperor, suzong, recaptured, chang, an, he, sent, messengers, to, emperor, xuanzong, requesting, that, he, return, to, chang, an, and, offering, the, throne, back, to, emperor, xuanzong, emperor, xuanzong, apprehensive, of, the, offer, initially, not, only, declined, but, further, requested, to, remain, in, jiannan, only, after, emperor, suzong, at, the, suggestion, of, his, strategist, li, mi, had, the, government, officials, make, a, joint, submission, to, emperor, xuanzong, no, longer, mentioning, the, return, of, the, throne, did, emperor, xuanzong, agree, to, depart, jiannan, to, return, to, chang, an, on, the, way, back, to, chang, an, he, had, gao, lishi, try, to, dig, up, consort, yang, yuhuan, s, body, for, reburial, but, her, body, had, already, decomposed, only, her, fragrance, bag, remained, emperor, xuanzong, took, the, fragrance, bag, back, to, chang, an, and, visited, it, daily, as, if, consort, yang, were, still, alive, on, 17, january, 758, he,

imperial, princes, after, emperor, xuanzong, was, back, in, chang, an, he, largely, stayed, out, of, policy, decisions, although, he, at, times, still, exerted, his, influence, on, emperor, suzong, for, example, emperor, suzong, had, wanted, to, spare, zhang, shuo, s, sons, zhang, jun, and, zhang, ji, who, had, previously, submitted, to, an, lushan, because, of, zhang, shuo, s, contributions, and, zhang, jun, s, and, zhang, ji, s, prior, efforts, to, protect, him, from, li, linfu, s, machinations, but, emperor, xuanzong, deeply, hated, them, for, having, surrendered, to, an, and, at, emperor, xuanzong, s, insistence, zhang, jun, was, executed, and, zhang, ji, was, exiled, to, lingnan, meanwhile, after, a, while, emperor, xuanzong, settled, into, a, routine, at, xingqing, palace,
