mitchell, cornwall, 1754, 1755, clive, s, actions, on, behalf, of, the, eic, have, made, him, one, of, britain, s, most, controversial, colonial, figures, his, achievements, included, checking, french, imperialist, ambitions, on, the, coromandel, coast, and, establishing, eic, control, over, bengal, thereby, furthering, the, establishment, of, the, british, raj, though, he, worked, only, as,

was, absolved, from, every, charge, historians, have, criticised, clive, s, management, of, bengal, during, his, tenure, with, the, eic, in, particular, regarding, responsibility, in, contributing,

reasons, that, are, unknown, clive, was, sent, to, live, with, his, mother, s, sister, in, manchester, while, still, a, toddler, the, site, is, now, hope, hospital, biographer, robert, harvey, suggests, that, this, move, was, made, because, clive, s, father, was, busy, in, london, trying, to, provide, for, the, family, daniel, bayley, the, sister, s, husband, reported, that, the, boy, was, out, of, measure, addicted, to, fighting, he, was, a, regular, troublemaker, in, the, schools, to, which, he, was, sent, when, he, was, older, he, and, a, gang, of, teenagers, established, a, protection, racket, that, vandalised, the, shops, of, uncooperative, merchants, in, market, drayton, there, clive, also, exhibited, fearlessness, at, an, early, age, he, is, reputed, to, have, climbed, the, tower, of, st, mary, s, parish, church, in, market, drayton, and, perched, on, a, gargoyle, frightening, those, down, below, when, clive, was, nine, his, aunt, died, and, after, a, brief, stint, in, his, father, s, cramped, london, quarters, he, returned, to, shropshire, there, he, attended, the, market, drayton, grammar, school, where, his, unruly, behaviour, and, an, improvement, in, the, family, s, fortunes, prompted, his, father, to, send, him, to, merchant, taylors, school, in, london, his, bad, behaviour, continued, and, he, was, then, sent, to, a, trade, school, in, hertfordshire, to, complete, a, basic, education, despite, his, early, lack, of, scholarship, in, his, later, years, he, devoted, himself, to, improving, his, education, he, eventually, developed, a, distinctive, writing, style, and, a, speech, in, the, house, of, commons, was, described, by, william, pitt, as, the, most, eloquent, he, had, ever, heard, in, 1744, clive, s, father, acquired, for, him, a, position, as, a, factor, or, company, agent, in, the, service, of, the, east, india, company, and, clive, set, sail, for, india, after, running, aground, on, the, coast, of, brazil, his, ship, was, detained, for, nine, months, while, repairs, were, completed, this, enabled, him, to, learn, some, portuguese, one, of, the, several, languages, then, in, use, in, south, india, because, of, the, portuguese, centre, at, goa, at, this, time, the, east, india, company, had, a, small, settlement, at, fort, st, george, near, the, village, of, madraspatnam, later, madras, now, the, major, indian, metropolis, of, chennai, in, addition, to, others, at, calcutta, bombay, and, cuddalore, clive, arrived, at, fort, st, george, in, june, 1744, and, spent, the, next, two, years, working, as, little, more, than, a, glorified, assistant, shopkeeper, tallying, books, and, arguing, with, suppliers, of, the, east, india, company, over, the, quality, and, quantity, of, their, wares, he, was, given, access, to, the, governor, s, library, where, he, became, a, prolific, reader, the, india, clive, arrived, in, was, divided, into, a, number, of, successor, states, to, the, mughal, empire, over, the, forty, years, since, the, death, of, the, emperor, aurangzeb, in, 1707, the, power, of, the, emperor, had, gradually, fallen, into, the, hands, of, his, provincial, viceroys, or, subahdars, the, dominant, rulers, on, the, coromandel, coast, were, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, asaf, jah, i, and, the, nawab, of, the, carnatic, anwaruddin, muhammed, khan, the, nawab, nominally, owed, fealty, to, the, nizam, but, in, many, respects, acted, independently, fort, st, george, and, the, french, trading, post, at, pondicherry, were, both, located, in, the, nawab, s, territory, the, relationship, between, the, europeans, in, india, was, influenced, by, a, series, of, wars, and, treaties, in, europe, and, by, competing, commercial, rivalry, for, trade, on, the, subcontinent, through, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, french, dutch, portuguese, and, british, had, vied, for, control, of, various, trading, posts, and, for, trading, rights, and, favour, with, local, indian, rulers, the, european, merchant, companies, raised, bodies, of, troops, to, protect, their, commercial, interests, and, latterly, to, influence, local, politics, to, their, advantage, military, power, was, rapidly, becoming, as, important, as, commercial, acumen, in, securing, india, s, valuable, trade, and, increasingly, it, was, used, to, appropriate, territory, and, to, collect, land, revenue, in, 1720, france, effectively, nationalised, the, french, east, india, company, and, began, using, it, to, expand, its, imperial, interests, this, became, a, source, of, conflict, with, the, british, in, india, with, the, entry, of, britain, into, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, in, 1744, the, indian, theatre, of, the, conflict, is, also, known, as, the, first, carnatic, war, referring, to, the, carnatic, region, on, the, southeast, coast, of, india, hostilities, in, india, began, with, a, british, naval, attack, on, a, french, fleet, in, 1745, which, led, the, french, governor, general, dupleix, to, request, additional, forces, on, 4, september, 1746, madras, was, attacked, by, french, forces, led, by, la, bourdonnais, after, several, days, of, bombardment, the, british, surrendered, and, the, french, entered, the, city, the, british, leadership, was, taken, prisoner, and, sent, to, pondicherry, it, was, originally, agreed, that, the, town, would, be, restored, to, the, british, after, negotiation, but, this, was, opposed, by, dupleix, who, sought, to, annex, madras, to, french, holdings, the, remaining, british, residents, were, asked, to, take, an, oath, promising, not, to, take, up, arms, against, the, french, clive, and, a, handful, of, others, refused, and, were, kept, under, weak, guard, as, the, french, prepared, to, destroy, the, fort, disguising, themselves, as, natives, clive, and, three, others, eluded, their, inattentive, sentry, slipped, out, of, the, fort, and, made, their, way, to, fort, st, david, the, british, post, at, cuddalore, some, 50, miles, 80, km, to, the, south, upon, his, arrival, clive, decided, to, enlist, in, the, company, army, rather, than, remain, idle, in, the, hierarchy, of, the, company, this, was, seen, as, a, step, down, clive, was, however, recognised, for, his, contribution, in, the, defence, of, fort, st, david, where, the, french, assault, on, 11, march, 1747, was, repulsed, with, the, assistance, of, the, nawab, of, the, carnatic, and, was, given, a, commission, as, ensign, in, the, conflict, clive, s, bravery, came, to, the, attention, of, major, stringer, lawrence, who, arrived, in, 1748, to, take, command, of, the, british, troops, at, fort, st, david, during, the, 1748, siege, of, pondicherry, clive, distinguished, himself, in, successfully, defending, a, trench, against, a, french, sortie, one, witness, of, the, action, wrote, clive, s, platoon, animated, by, his, exhortation, fired, again, with, new, courage, and, great, vivacity, upon, the, enemy, the, siege, was, lifted, in, october, 1748, with, the, arrival, of, the, monsoons, but, the, war, came, to, a, conclusion, with, the, arrival, in, december, of, news, of, the, peace, of, aix, la, chapelle, madras, was, returned, to, the, british, as, part, of, the, peace, agreement, in, early, 1749, the, end, of, the, war, between, france, and, britain, did, not, however, end, hostilities, in, india, even, before, news, of, the, peace, arrived, in, india, the, british, had, sent, an, expedition, to, tanjore, on, behalf, of, a, claimant, to, its, throne, this, expedition, on, which, clive, now, promoted, to, lieutenant, served, as, a, volunteer, was, a, disastrous, failure, monsoons, ravaged, the, land, forces, and, the, local, support, claimed, by, their, client, was, not, in, evidence, the, ignominious, retreat, of, the, british, force, which, lost, its, baggage, train, to, the, pursuing, tanjorean, army, while, crossing, a, swollen, river, was, a, blow, to, the, british, reputation, major, lawrence, seeking, to, recover, british, prestige, led, the, entire, madras, garrison, to, tanjore, in, response, at, the, fort, of, devikottai, on, the, coleroon, river, the, british, force, was, confronted, by, the, much, larger, tanjorean, army, lawrence, gave, clive, command, of, 30, british, soldiers, and, 700, sepoys, with, orders, to, lead, the, assault, on, the, fort, clive, led, this, force, rapidly, across, the, river, and, toward, the, fort, where, the, small, british, unit, became, separated, from, the, sepoys, and, were, enveloped, by, the, tanjorean, cavalry, clive, was, nearly, cut, down, and, the, beachhead, almost, lost, before, reinforcements, sent, by, lawrence, arrived, to, save, the, day, the, daring, move, by, clive, had, an, important, consequence, the, tanjoreans, abandoned, the, fort, which, the, british, triumphantly, occupied, the, success, prompted, the, tanjorean, rajah, to, open, peace, talks, which, resulted, in, the, british, being, awarded, devikottai, and, the, costs, of, their, expedition, and, the, british, client, was, awarded, a, pension, in, exchange, for, renouncing, his, claim, lawrence, wrote, of, clive, s, action, that, he, behaved, in, courage, and, in, judgment, much, beyond, what, could, be, expected, from, his, years, on, the, expedition, s, return, the, process, of, restoring, madras, was, completed, company, officials, concerned, about, the, cost, of, the, military, slashed, its, size, denying, clive, a, promotion, to, captain, in, the, process, lawrence, procured, for, clive, a, position, as, the, commissary, at, fort, st, george, a, potentially, lucrative, posting, its, pay, included, commissions, on, all, supply, contracts, the, death, of, asaf, jah, i, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, in, 1748, sparked, a, struggle, to, succeed, him, that, is, known, as, the, second, carnatic, war, which, was, also, furthered, by, the, expansionist, interests, of, french, governor, general, dupleix, dupleix, had, grasped, from, the, first, war, that, small, numbers, of, disciplined, european, forces, and, well, trained, sepoys, could, be, used, to, tip, balances, of, power, between, competing, interests, and, used, this, idea, to, greatly, expand, french, influence, in, southern, india, for, many, years, he, had, been, working, to, negotiate, the, release, of, chanda, sahib, a, longtime, french, ally, who, had, at, one, time, occupied, the, throne, of, tanjore, and, sought, for, himself, the, throne, of, the, carnatic, chanda, sahib, had, been, imprisoned, by, the, marathas, in, 1740, by, 1748, he, had, been, released, from, custody, and, was, building, an, army, at, satara, upon, the, death, of, asaf, jah, i, his, son, nasir, jung, seized, the, throne, of, hyderabad, although, asaf, jah, had, designated, as, his, successor, his, grandson, muzaffar, jung, the, grandson, who, was, ruler, of, bijapur, fled, west, to, join, chanda, sahib, whose, army, was, also, reinforced, by, french, troops, sent, by, dupleix, these, forces, met, those, of, anwaruddin, mohammed, khan, in, the, battle, of, ambur, in, august, 1749, anwaruddin, was, slain, and, chanda, sahib, victorious, entered, the, carnatic, capital, arcot, anwaruddin, s, son, muhammed, ali, khan, wallajah, fled, to, trichinopoly, where, he, sought, the, protection, and, assistance, of, the, british, in, thanks, for, french, assistance, the, victors, awarded, them, a, number, of, villages, including, territory, nominally, under, british, sway, near, cuddalore, and, madras, the, british, began, sending, additional, arms, to, muhammed, ali, khan, wallajah, and, sought, to, bring, nasir, jung, into, the, fray, to, oppose, chanda, sahib, nasir, jung, came, south, to, gingee, in, 1750, where, he, requested, and, received, a, detachment, of, british, troops, chanda, sahib, s, forces, advanced, to, meet, them, but, retreated, after, a, brief, long, range, cannonade, nasir, jung, pursued, and, was, able, to, capture, arcot, and, his, nephew, muzaffar, jung, following, a, series, of, fruitless, negotiations, and, intrigues, nasir, jung, was, assassinated, by, a, rebellious, soldier, this, made, muzaffar, jung, nizam, and, confirmed, chanda, sahib, as, nawab, of, the, carnatic, both, with, french, support, dupleix, was, rewarded, for, french, assistance, with, titled, nobility, and, rule, of, the, nizam, s, territories, south, of, the, kistna, river, his, territories, were, said, to, yield, an, annual, revenue, of, over, 350, 000, rupees, robert, clive, was, not, in, southern, india, for, many, of, these, events, in, 1750, clive, was, afflicted, with, some, sort, of, nervous, disorder, and, was, sent, north, to, bengal, to, recuperate, it, was, there, that, he, met, and, befriended, robert, orme, who, became, his, principal, chronicler, and, biographer, clive, returned, to, madras, in, 1751, in, the, summer, of, 1751, chanda, sahib, left, arcot, to, besiege, muhammed, ali, khan, wallajah, at, trichinopoly, this, placed, the, british, at, madras, in, a, precarious, position, since, the, latter, was, the, last, of, their, major, allies, in, the, area, the, british, company, s, military, was, also, in, some, disarray, as, stringer, lawrence, had, returned, to, england, in, 1750, over, a, pay, dispute, and, much, of, the, company, was, apathetic, about, the, dangers, the, expanding, french, influence, and, declining, british, influence, posed, the, weakness, of, the, british, military, command, was, exposed, when, a, force, was, sent, from, madras, to, support, muhammad, ali, at, trichinopoly, but, its, commander, a, swiss, mercenary, refused, to, attack, an, outpost, at, valikondapuram, clive, who, accompanied, the, force, as, commissary, was, outraged, at, the, decision, to, abandon, the, siege, he, rode, to, cuddalore, and, offered, his, services, to, lead, an, attack, on, arcot, if, he, was, given, a, captain, s, commission, arguing, this, would, force, chanda, sahib, to, either, abandon, the, siege, of, trichinopoly, or, significantly, reduce, the, force, there, madras, and, fort, st, david, could, supply, him, with, only, 200, europeans, 300, sepoys, and, three, small, cannons, furthermore, of, the, eight, officers, who, led, them, four, were, civilians, like, clive, and, six, had, never, been, in, action, clive, hoping, to, surprise, the, small, garrison, at, arcot, made, a, series, of, forced, marches, including, some, under, extremely, rainy, conditions, although, he, did, fail, to, achieve, surprise, the, garrison, hearing, of, the, march, being, made, under, such, arduous, conditions, opted, to, abandon, the, fort, and, town, clive, occupied, arcot, without, firing, a, shot, the, fort, was, a, rambling, structure, with, a, dilapidated, wall, a, mile, long, too, long, for, his, small, force, to, effectively, man, and, it, was, surrounded, by, the, densely, packed, housing, of, the, town, its, moat, was, shallow, or, dry, and, some, of, its, towers, were, insufficiently, strong, to, use, as, artillery, mounts, clive, did, the, best, he, could, to, prepare, for, the, onslaught, he, expected, he, made, a, foray, against, the, fort, s, former, garrison, encamped, a, few, miles, away, which, had, no, significant, effect, when, the, former, garrison, was, reinforced, by, 2, 000, men, chanda, sahib, sent, from, trichinopoly, it, reoccupied, the, town, on, 15, september, that, night, clive, led, most, of, his, force, out, of, the, fort, and, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, the, besiegers, because, of, the, darkness, the, besiegers, had, no, idea, how, large, clive, s, force, was, and, they, fled, in, panic, the, next, day, clive, learned, that, heavy, guns, he, had, requested, from, madras, were, approaching, so, he, sent, most, of, his, garrison, out, to, escort, them, into, the, fort, that, night, the, besiegers, who, had, spotted, the, movement, launched, an, attack, on, the, fort, with, only, 70, men, in, the, fort, clive, once, again, was, able, to, disguise, his, small, numbers, and, sowed, sufficient, confusion, against, his, enemies, that, multiple, assaults, against, the, fort, were, successfully, repulsed, that, morning, the, guns, arrived, and, chanda, sahib, s, men, again, retreated, over, the, next, week, clive, and, his, men, worked, feverishly, to, improve, the, defences, aware, that, another, 4, 000, men, led, by, chanda, sahib, s, son, raza, sahib, and, accompanied, by, a, small, contingent, of, french, troops, was, on, its, way, most, of, these, troops, came, from, pondicherry, not, trichinopoly, and, thus, did, not, have, the, effect, clive, desired, of, raising, that, siege, clive, was, forced, to, reduce, his, garrison, to, about, 300, men, sending, the, rest, of, his, force, to, madras, in, case, the, enemy, army, decided, to, go, there, instead, raza, sahib, arrived, at, arcot, and, on, 23, september, occupied, the, town, that, night, clive, launched, a, daring, attack, against, the, french, artillery, seeking, to, capture, their, guns, the, attack, very, nearly, succeeded, in, its, object, but, was, reversed, when, enemy, sniper, fire, tore, into, the, small, british, force, clive, himself, was, targeted, on, more, than, one, occasion, one, man, pulled, him, down, and, was, shot, dead, the, affair, was, a, serious, blow, 15, of, clive, s, men, were, killed, and, another, 15, wounded, over, the, next, month, the, besiegers, slowly, tightened, their, grips, on, the, fort, clive, s, men, were, subjected, to, frequent, sniper, attacks, and, disease, lowering, the, garrison, size, to, 200, he, was, heartened, to, learn, that, some, 6, 000, maratha, forces, had, been, convinced, to, come, to, his, relief, but, that, they, were, awaiting, payment, before, proceeding, the, approach, of, this, force, prompted, raza, sahib, to, demand, clive, s, surrender, clive, s, response, was, an, immediate, rejection, and, he, further, insulted, raza, sahib, by, suggesting, that, he, should, reconsider, sending, his, rabble, of, troops, against, a, british, held, position, the, siege, finally, reached, critical, when, raza, sahib, launched, an, all, out, assault, against, the, fort, on, 14, november, clive, s, small, force, maintained, its, composure, and, established, killing, fields, outside, the, walls, of, the, fort, where, the, attackers, sought, to, gain, entry, several, hundred, attackers, were, killed, and, many, more, wounded, while, clive, s, small, force, suffered, only, four, british, and, two, sepoy, casualties, the, historian, thomas, babington, macaulay, wrote, a, century, later, of, the, siege, the, commander, who, had, to, conduct, the, defence, was, a, young, man, of, five, and, twenty, who, had, been, bred, as, a, book, keeper, clive, had, made, his, arrangements, and, exhausted, by, fatigue, had, thrown, himself, on, his, bed, he, was, awakened, by, the, alarm, and, was, instantly, at, his, post, after, three, desperate, onsets, the, besiegers, retired, behind, the, ditch, the, struggle, lasted, about, an, hour, the, garrison, lost, only, five, or, six, men, his, conduct, during, the, siege, made, clive, famous, in, europe, the, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, elder, described, clive, who, had, received, no, formal, military, training, whatsoever, as, the, heaven, born, general, endorsing, the, generous, appreciation, of, his, early, commander, major, lawrence, the, court, of, directors, of, the, east, india, company, voted, him, a, sword, worth, 700, which, he, refused, to, receive, unless, lawrence, was, similarly, honoured, clive, and, major, lawrence, were, able, to, bring, the, campaign, to, a, successful, conclusion, in, 1754, the, first, of, the, provisional, carnatic, treaties, was, signed, between, thomas, saunders, the, company, president, at, madras, and, charles, godeheu, the, french, commander, who, displaced, dupleix, mohammed, ali, khan, wallajah, was, recognised, as, nawab, and, both, nations, agreed, to, equalise, their, possessions, when, war, again, broke, out, in, 1756, during, clive, s, absence, in, bengal, the, french, obtained, successes, in, the, northern, districts, and, it, was, mohammed, ali, khan, wallajah, s, efforts, which, drove, them, from, their, settlements, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, formally, confirmed, mohammed, ali, khan, wallajah, as, nawab, of, the, carnatic, it, was, a, result, of, this, action, and, the, increased, british,

who, reportedly, had, fallen, in, love, with, her, portrait, when, she, arrived, clive, was, a, national, hero, they, were, married, at, st, mary, s, church, in, then, madras, on, 18, february, 1753, they, then, returned, to, england, clive, also, briefly, sat, as, member, of, parliament, for, the, cornwall, rotten, borough, of, st, michael, s, which, then, returned, two, members, from, 1754, to, 1755, he, and, his, colleague, john, stephenson, were, later, unseated, by, petition, of, their, defeated, opponents, richard, hussey, and, simon, luttrell, in, july, 1755, clive, returned, to, india, to, act, as, deputy, governor, of, fort, st, david, at, cuddalore, he, arrived, after, having, lost, a, considerable, fortune, en, route, as, the, doddington, the, lead, ship, of, his, convoy, was, wrecked, near, port, elizabeth, losing, a, chest, of, gold, coins, belonging, to, clive, worth, 33, 000, equivalent, to, 6, 500, 000, in, 2023, nearly, 250, years, later, in, 1998, illegally, salvaged, coins, from, clive, s, treasure, chest, were, offered, for, sale, and, in, 2002, a, portion, of, the, coins, were, given, to, the, south, african, government, after, protracted, legal, wrangling, clive, now, promoted, to, lieutenant, colonel, in, the, british, army, took, part, in, the, capture, of, the, fortress, of, gheriah, a, stronghold, of, the, maratha, admiral, tuloji, angre, the, action, was, led, by, admiral, james, watson, and, the, british, had, several, ships, available, some, royal, troops, and, some, maratha, allies, the, overwhelming, strength, of, the, joint, british, and, maratha, forces, ensured, that, the, battle, was, won, with, few, losses, a, fleet, surgeon, edward, ives, noted, that, clive, refused, to, take, any, part, of, the, treasure, divided, among, the, victorious, forces, as, was, custom, at, the, time, following, this, action, clive, headed, to, his, post, at, fort, st, david, and, it, was, there, he, received, news, of, twin, disasters, for, the, british, early, in, 1756, siraj, ud, daulah, had, succeeded, his, grandfather, alivardi, khan, as, nawab, of, bengal, in, june, clive, received, news, that, the, new, nawab, had, attacked, the, british, at, kasimbazar, and, shortly, afterwards, on, 20, june, he, had, taken, the, fort, at, calcutta, the, losses, to, the, company, because, of, the, fall, of, calcutta, were, estimated, by, investors, at, 2, 000, 000, equivalent, to, 380, 000, 000, in, 2023, those, british, who, were, captured, were, placed, in, a, punishment, cell, which, became, infamous, as, the, black, hole, of, calcutta, in, stifling, summer, heat, it, was, reported, that, 43, of, the, 64, prisoners, died, as, a, result, of, suffocation, or, heat, stroke, while, the, black, hole, became, infamous, in, britain, it, is, debatable, whether, the, nawab, was, aware, of, the, incident, by, christmas, 1756, as, no, response, had, been, received, to, diplomatic, letters, to, the, nawab, admiral, charles, watson, and, clive, were, dispatched, to, attack, the, nawab, s, army, and, remove, him, from, calcutta, by, force, their, first, target, was, the, fortress, of, baj, baj, which, clive, approached, by, land, while, admiral, watson, bombarded, it, from, the, sea, the, fortress, was, quickly, taken, with, minimal, british, casualties, shortly, afterwards, on, 2, january, 1757, calcutta, itself, was, taken, with, similar, ease, approximately, a, month, later, on, 3, february, 1757, clive, encountered, the, army, of, the, nawab, itself, for, two, days, the, army, marched, past, clive, s, camp, to, take, up, a, position, east, of, calcutta, sir, eyre, coote, serving, in, the, british, forces, estimated, the, enemy, s, strength, as, 40, 000, cavalry, 60, 000, infantry, and, thirty, cannon, even, allowing, for, overestimation, this, was, considerably, more, than, clive, s, force, of, approximately, 540, british, infantry, 600, royal, navy, sailors, 800, local, sepoys, fourteen, field, guns, and, no, cavalry, the, british, forces, attacked, the, nawab, s, camp, during, the, early, morning, hours, of, 5, february, 1757, in, this, battle, unofficially, called, the, calcutta, gauntlet, clive, marched, his, small, force, through, the, entire, nawab, s, camp, despite, being, under, heavy, fire, from, all, sides, by, noon, clive, s, force, broke, through, the, besieging, camp, and, arrived, safely, at, fort, william, during, the, assault, around, one, tenth, of, the, british, attackers, became, casualties, clive, reported, his, losses, at, 57, killed, and, 137, wounded, while, technically, not, a, victory, in, military, terms, the, sudden, british, assault, intimidated, the, nawab, he, sought, to, make, terms, with, clive, and, surrendered, control, of, calcutta, on, 9, february, promising, to, compensate, the, east, india, company, for, damages, suffered, and, to, restore, its, privileges, as, britain, and, france, were, once, more, at, war, clive, sent, the, fleet, up, the, river, against, the, french, colony, of, chandannagar, while, he, besieged, it, by, land, there, was, a, strong, incentive, to, capture, the, colony, as, capture, of, a, previous, french, settlement, near, pondicherry, had, yielded, the, combined, forces, prizes, valued, at, 130, 000, equivalent, to, 22, 000, 000, in, 2023, after, consenting, to, the, siege, the, nawab, unsuccessfully, sought, to, assist, the, french, some, officials, of, the, nawab, s, court, formed, a, confederacy, to, depose, him, jafar, ali, khan, also, known, as, mir, jafar, the, nawab, s, commander, in, chief, led, the, conspirators, with, admiral, watson, governor, drake, and, mr, watts, clive, made, a, gentlemen, s, agreement, in, which, it, was, agreed, to, give, the, office, of, viceroy, of, bengal, bihar, and, odisha, to, mir, jafar, who, was, to, pay, 1, 000, 000, equivalent, to, 170, 000, 000, in, 2023, to, the, company, for, its, losses, in, calcutta, and, the, cost, of, its, troops, 500, 000, equivalent, to, 80, 000, 000, in, 2023, to, the, british, inhabitants, of, calcutta, 200, 000, equivalent, to, 33, 900, 000, in, 2023, to, the, native, inhabitants, and, 70, 000, equivalent, to, 11, 900, 000, in, 2023, to, its, armenian, merchants, clive, employed, umichand, a, rich, bengali, trader, as, an, agent, between, mir, jafar, and, the, british, officials, umichand, threatened, to, betray, clive, unless, he, was, guaranteed, in, the, agreement, itself, 300, 000, equivalent, to, 56, 400, 000, in, 2023, to, dupe, him, a, fictitious, agreement, was, shown, to, him, with, a, clause, to, this, effect, admiral, watson, refused, to, sign, it, clive, deposed, later, to, the, house, of, commons, that, to, the, best, of, his, remembrance, he, gave, the, gentleman, who, carried, it, leave, to, sign, his, name, upon, it, his, lordship, never, made, any, secret, of, it, he, thinks, it, warrantable, in, such, a, case, and, would, do, it, again, a, hundred, times, he, had, no, interested, motive, in, doing, it, and, did, it, with, a, design, of, disappointing, the, expectations, of, a, rapacious, man, the, whole, hot, season, of, 1757, was, spent, in, negotiations, with, the, nawab, of, bengal, in, the, middle, of, june, clive, began, his, march, from, chandannagar, with, the, british, in, boats, and, the, sepoys, along, the, right, bank, of, the, hooghly, river, during, the, rainy, season, the, hooghly, is, fed, by, the, overflow, of, the, ganges, to, the, north, through, three, streams, which, in, the, hot, months, are, nearly, dry, on, the, left, bank, of, the, bhagirathi, the, most, westerly, of, these, 100, miles, 160, km, above, chandernagore, stands, murshidabad, the, capital, of, the, mughal, viceroys, of, bengal, some, miles, farther, down, is, the, field, of, plassey, then, an, extensive, grove, of, mango, trees, on, 21, june, 1757, clive, arrived, on, the, bank, opposite, plassey, in, the, midst, of, the, first, outburst, of, monsoon, rain, his, whole, army, amounted, to, 1, 100, europeans, and, 2, 100, sepoy, troops, with, nine, field, pieces, the, nawab, had, drawn, up, 18, 000, horse, 50, 000, foot, and, 53, pieces, of, heavy, ordnance, served, by, french, artillerymen, for, once, in, his, career, clive, hesitated, and, called, a, council, of, sixteen, officers, to, decide, as, he, put, it, whether, in, our, present, situation, without, assistance, and, on, our, own, bottom, it, would, be, prudent, to, attack, the, nawab, or, whether, we, should, wait, till, joined, by, some, country, indian, power, clive, himself, headed, the, nine, who, voted, for, delay, major, eyre, coote, led, the, seven, who, counselled, immediate, attack, but, either, because, his, daring, asserted, itself, or, because, of, a, letter, received, from, mir, jafar, clive, was, the, first, to, change, his, mind, and, to, communicate, with, major, eyre, coote, one, tradition, followed, by, macaulay, represents, him, as, spending, an, hour, in, thought, under, the, shade, of, some, trees, while, he, resolved, the, issues, of, what, was, to, prove, one, of, the, decisive, battles, of, the, world, another, turned, into, verse, by, sir, alfred, lyall, pictures, his, resolution, as, the, result, of, a, dream, however, that, may, be, he, did, well, as, a, soldier, to, trust, to, the, dash, and, even, rashness, that, had, gained, arcot, and, triumphed, at, calcutta, since, retreat, or, even, delay, might, have, resulted, in, defeat, after, heavy, rain, clive, s, 3, 200, men, and, the, nine, guns, crossed, the, river, and, took, possession, of, the, grove, and, its, tanks, of, water, while, clive, established, his, headquarters, in, a, hunting, lodge, on, 23, june, the, engagement, took, place, and, lasted, the, whole, day, during, which, remarkably, little, actual, fighting, took, place, gunpowder, for, the, cannons, of, the, nawab, was, not, well, protected, from, rain, that, impaired, those, cannons, except, for, the, 40, frenchmen, and, the, guns, they, worked, the, indian, side, could, do, little, to, reply, to, the, british, cannonade, after, a, spell, of, rain, which, with, the, 39th, regiment, scattered, the, host, inflicting, on, it, a, loss, of, 500, men, clive, had, already, made, a, secret, agreement, with, aristocrats, in, bengal, including, jagat, seth, and, mir, jafar, clive, restrained, major, kilpatrick, for, he, trusted, to, mir, jafar, s, abstinence, if, not, desertion, to, his, ranks, and, knew, the, importance, of, sparing, his, own, small, force, he, was, fully, justified, in, his, confidence, in, mir, jafar, s, treachery, to, his, master, for, he, led, a, large, portion, of, the, nawab, s, army, away, from, the, battlefield, ensuring, his, defeat, clive, lost, hardly, any, european, troops, in, all, 22, sepoys, were, killed, and, 50, wounded, it, is, curious, in, many, ways, that, clive, is, now, best, remembered, for, this, battle, which, was, essentially, won, by, suborning, the, opposition, rather, than, through, fighting, or, brilliant, military, tactics, whilst, it, established, british, military, supremacy, in, bengal, it, did, not, secure, the, east, india, company, s, control, over, upper, india, as, is, sometimes, claimed, that, would, come, only, seven, years, later, in, 1764, at, the, battle, of, buxar, where, sir, hector, munro, defeated, the, combined, forces, of, the, mughal, emperor, and, the, nawab, of, awadh, in, a, much, more, closely, fought, encounter, siraj, ud, daulah, fled, from, the, field, on, a, camel, securing, what, wealth, he, could, he, was, soon, captured, by, mir, jafar, s, forces, and, later, executed, by, the, assassin, mohammadi, beg, clive, entered, murshidabad, and, established, mir, jafar, as, nawab, the, price, which, had, been, agreed, beforehand, for, his, treachery, clive, was, taken, through, the, treasury, amid, 1, 500, 000, equivalent, to, 250, 000, 000, in, 2023, sterling, s, worth, of, rupees, gold, and, silver, plate, jewels, and, rich, goods, and, besought, to, ask, what, he, would, clive, took, 160, 000, equivalent, to, 27, 100, 000, in, 2023, a, vast, fortune, for, the, day, while, 500, 000, equivalent, to, 80, 000, 000, in, 2023, was, distributed, among, the, army, and, navy, of, the, east, india, company, and, provided, gifts, of, 24, 000, equivalent, to, 4, 100, 000, in, 2023, to, each, member, of, the, company, s, committee, as, well, as, the, public, compensation, stipulated, for, in, the, treaty, in, this, extraction, of, wealth, clive, followed, a, usage, fully, recognised, by, the, company, although, this, was, the, source, of, future, corruption, which, clive, was, later, sent, to, india, again, to, correct, the, company, itself, acquired, revenue, of, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 16, 900, 000, in, 2023, a, year, and, a, contribution, towards, its, losses, and, military, expenditure, of, 1, 500, 000, sterling, equivalent, to, 250, 000, 000, in, 2023, mir, jafar, further, discharged, his, debt, to, clive, by, afterwards, presenting, him, with, the, quit, rent, of, the, company, s, lands, in, and, around, calcutta, amounting, to, an, annuity, of, 27, 000, equivalent, to, 4, 600, 000, in, 2023, for, life, and, leaving, him, by, will, the, sum, of, 70, 000, equivalent, to, 11, 900, 000, in, 2023, which, clive, devoted, to, the, army, while, busy, with, the, civil, administration, clive, continued, to, follow, up, his, military, success, he, sent, major, coote, in, pursuit, of, the, french, almost, as, far, as, benares, he, dispatched, colonel, forde, to, vizagapatam, and, the, northern, districts, of, madras, where, forde, won, the, battle, of, condore, 1758, pronounced, by, broome, one, of, the, most, brilliant, actions, on, military, record, clive, came, into, direct, contact, with, the, mughal, himself, for, the, first, time, a, meeting, which, would, prove, beneficial, in, his, later, career, prince, ali, gauhar, escaped, from, delhi, after, his, father, the, mughal, emperor, alamgir, ii, had, been, murdered, by, the, usurping, vizier, imad, ul, mulk, and, his, maratha, associate, sadashivrao, bhau, prince, ali, gauhar, was, welcomed, and, protected, by, shuja, ud, daula, the, nawab, of, awadh, in, 1760, after, gaining, control, over, bihar, odisha, and, some, parts, of, the, bengal, ali, gauhar, and, his, mughal, army, of, 30, 000, intended, to, overthrow, mir, jafar, and, the, company, in, order, to, reconquer, the, riches, of, the, eastern, subahs, for, the, mughal, empire, ali, gauhar, was, accompanied, by, muhammad, quli, khan, hidayat, ali, mir, afzal, kadim, husein, and, ghulam, husain, tabatabai, their, forces, were, reinforced, by, the, forces, of, shuja, ud, daula, and, najib, ud, daula, the, mughals, were, also, joined, by, jean, law, and, 200, frenchmen, and, waged, a, campaign, against, the, british, during, the, seven, years, war, prince, ali, gauhar, successfully, advanced, as, far, as, patna, which, he, later, besieged, with, a, combined, army, of, over, 40, 000, in, order, to, capture, or, kill, ramnarian, a, sworn, enemy, of, the, mughals, mir, jafar, was, terrified, at, the, near, demise, of, his, cohort, and, sent, his, own, son, miran, to, relieve, ramnarian, and, retake, patna, mir, jafar, also, implored, the, aid, of, robert, clive, but, it, was, major, john, caillaud, who, defeated, and, dispersed, prince, ali, gauhar, s, army, while, clive, was, preoccupied, with, fighting, the, french, the, dutch, directors, of, the, outpost, at, chinsurah, not, far, from, chandernagore, seeing, an, opportunity, to, expand, their, influence, agreed, to, send, additional, troops, to, chinsurah, despite, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, not, formally, being, at, war, a, dutch, fleet, of, seven, ships, containing, more, than, fifteen, hundred, european, and, malay, troops, came, from, batavia, and, arrived, at, the, mouth, of, the, hooghly, river, in, october, 1759, while, mir, jafar, the, nawab, of, bengal, was, meeting, with, clive, in, calcutta, they, met, a, mixed, force, of, british, and, local, troops, at, chinsurah, just, outside, calcutta, the, british, under, colonel, francis, forde, defeated, the, dutch, in, the, battle, of, chinsurah, forcing, them, to, withdraw, the, british, engaged, and, defeated, the, ships, the, dutch, used, to, deliver, the, troops, in, a, separate, naval, battle, on, 24, november, thus, clive, avenged, the, massacre, of, amboyna, the, occasion, when, he, wrote, his, famous, letter, dear, forde, fight, them, immediately, i, will, send, you, the, order, of, council, to, morrow, meanwhile, clive, improved, the, organisation, and, drill, of, the, sepoy, army, after, a, european, model, and, enlisted, into, it, many, muslims, from, upper, regions, of, the, mughal, empire, he, re, fortified, calcutta, in, 1760, after, four, years, of, hard, labour, his, health, gave, way, and, he, returned, to, england, it, appeared, wrote, a, contemporary, on, the, spot, as, if, the, soul, was, departing, from, the, government, of, bengal, he, had, been, formally, made, governor, of, bengal, by, the, court, of, directors, at, a, time, when, his, nominal, superiors, in, madras, sought, to, recall, him, to, their, help, there, but, he, had, discerned, the, importance, of, the, province, even, during, his, first, visit, to, its, rich, delta, mighty, rivers, and, teeming, population, clive, selected, some, able, subordinates, notably, a, young, warren, hastings, who, a, year, after, plassey, was, made, resident, at, the, nawab, s, court, the, long, term, outcome, of, plassey, was, to, place, a, very, heavy, revenue, burden, upon, bengal, the, company, sought, to, extract, the, maximum, revenue, possible, from, the, peasantry, to, fund, military, campaigns, and, corruption, was, widespread, amongst, its, officials, mir, jafar, was, compelled, to, engage, in, extortion, on, a, vast, scale, in, order, to, replenish, his, treasury, which, had, been, emptied, by, the, company, s, demand, for, an, indemnity, of, 2, 8, crores, of, rupees, 3, million, in, 1760, the, 35, year, old, clive, returned, to, great, britain, with, a, fortune, of, at, least, 300, 000, equivalent, to, 57, 300, 000, in, 2023, and, the, quit, rent, of, 27, 000, equivalent, to, 5, 200, 000, in, 2023, a, year, he, financially, supported, his, parents, and, sisters, while, also, providing, major, lawrence, the, commanding, officer, who, had, early, encouraged, his, military, genius, with, a, stipend, of, 500, equivalent, to, 100, 000, in, 2023, a, year, in, the, five, years, of, his, conquests, and, administration, in, bengal, the, young, man, had, crowded, together, a, succession, of, exploits, that, led, lord, macaulay, in, what, that, historian, termed, his, flashy, essay, on, the, subject, to, compare, him, to, napoleon, bonaparte, declaring, that, gave, peace, security, prosperity, and, such, liberty, as, the, case, allowed, of, to, millions, of, indians, who, had, for, centuries, been, the, prey, of, oppression, while, napoleon, s, career, of, conquest, was, inspired, only, by, personal, ambition, and, the, absolutism, he, established, vanished, with, his, fall, macaulay, s, ringing, endorsement, of, clive, seems, more, controversial, today, as, some, would, argue, that, clive, s, ambition, and, desire, for, personal, gain, set, the, tone, for, the, administration, of, bengal, until, the, permanent, settlement, 30, years, later, the, immediate, consequence, of, clive, s, victory, at, plassey, was, an, increase, in, the, revenue, demand, on, bengal, by, at, least, 20, which, led, to, considerable, hardship, for, the, rural, population, particularly, during, the, famine, of, 1770, during, the, three, years, that, clive, remained, in, great, britain, he, sought, a, political, position, chiefly, that, he, might, influence, the, course, of, events, in, india, which, he, had, left, full, of, promise, he, had, been, well, received, at, court, was, elevated, to, the, peerage, as, baron, clive, of, plassey, county, clare, had, bought, estates, and, returned, a, few, friends, as, well, as, himself, to, the, house, of, commons, clive, was, mp, for, shrewsbury, from, 1761, until, his, death, he, was, allowed, to, sit, in, the, commons, because, his, peerage, was, irish, he, was, also, elected, mayor, of, shrewsbury, for, 1762, 63, the, non, graduate, clive, received, an, honorary, degree, as, dcl, from, oxford, university, in, 1760, and, in, 1764, he, was, appointed, knight, of, the, order, of, the, bath, clive, set, himself, to, reform, the, home, system, of, the, east, india, company, and, began, a, bitter, dispute, with, the, chairman, of, the, court, of, directors, laurence, sulivan, whom, he, defeated, in, the, end, in, this, he, was, aided, by, the, news, of, reverses, in, bengal, mir, jafar, had, finally, rebelled, over, payments, to, british, officials, and, clive, s, successor, had, put, qasim, ali, khan, mir, jafar, s, son, in, law, upon, the, musnud, throne, after, a, brief, tenure, mir, qasim, had, fled, ordering, walter, reinhardt, sombre, known, to, the, muslims, as, sumru, a, swiss, mercenary, of, his, to, butcher, the, garrison, of, 150, british, at, patna, and, had, disappeared, under, the, protection, of, his, brother, the, viceroy, of, awadh, the, whole, company, s, service, civil, and, military, had, become, mired, in, corruption, demoralised, by, gifts, and, by, the, monopoly, of, inland, and, export, trade, to, such, an, extent, that, the, indians, were, pauperised, and, the, company, was, plundered, of, the, revenues, clive, had, acquired, for, this, clive, himself, must, bear, much, responsibility, as, he, had, set, a, very, poor, example, during, his, tenure, as, governor, nevertheless, the, court, of, proprietors, forced, the, directors, to, hurry, lord, clive, to, bengal, with, the, double, powers, of, governor, and, commander, in, chief, on, 11, april, 1765, clive, s, ship, docked, at, madras, upon, learning, of, mir, jafar, s, death, and, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, buxar, he, sent, a, coded, letter, to, a, friend, back, in, england, directing, him, to, mortgage, all, his, property, and, to, buy, as, much, stock, in, the, company, as, possible, before, the, news, broke, anticipating, that, its, value, would, rise, on, 3, may, 1765, clive, landed, at, calcutta, to, learn, that, mir, jafar, left, him, personally, 70, 000, equivalent, to, 12, 100, 000, in, 2023, mir, jafar, was, succeeded, by, his, son, in, law, kasim, ali, though, not, before, the, government, had, been, further, demoralised, by, taking, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 17, 300, 000, in, 2023, as, a, gift, from, the, new, nawab, while, kasim, ali, had, induced, not, only, the, viceroy, of, awadh, but, the, emperor, of, delhi, himself, to, invade, bihar, at, this, point, a, mutiny, in, the, bengal, army, occurred, which, was, a, grim, precursor, of, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, but, on, this, occasion, it, was, quickly, suppressed, by, blowing, the, sepoy, ringleader, from, a, gun, major, munro, the, napier, of, those, times, scattered, the, united, armies, on, the, hard, fought, field, of, buxar, the, emperor, shah, alam, ii, detached, himself, from, the, league, while, the, awadh, viceroy, threw, himself, on, the, mercy, of, the, british, clive, had, now, an, opportunity, of, repeating, in, hindustan, or, upper, india, what, he, had, accomplished, in, bengal, he, might, have, secured, what, is, now, called, uttar, pradesh, and, have, rendered, unnecessary, the, campaigns, of, wellesley, and, lake, but, he, believed, he, had, other, work, in, the, exploitation, of, the, revenues, and, resources, of, rich, bengal, itself, making, it, a, base, from, which, british, india, would, afterwards, steadily, grow, hence, he, returned, to, the, awadh, viceroy, all, his, territory, save, the, provinces, of, allahabad, and, kora, which, he, presented, to, the, weak, emperor, in, return, for, the, awadhian, provinces, clive, secured, from, the, emperor, one, of, the, most, important, documents, in, british, history, in, india, effectively, granting, title, of, bengal, to, clive, it, appears, in, the, records, as, firman, from, the, king, shah, aalum, granting, the, diwani, rights, of, bengal, bihar, and, odisha, to, the, company, 1765, the, date, was, 12, august, 1765, the, place, benares, the, throne, an, english, dining, table, covered, with, embroidered, cloth, and, surmounted, by, a, chair, in, clive, s, tent, it, is, all, pictured, by, a, muslim, contemporary, who, indignantly, exclaims, that, so, great, a, transaction, was, done, and, finished, in, less, time, than, would, have, been, taken, up, in, the, sale, of, a, jackass, by, this, deed, the, company, became, the, real, sovereign, rulers, of, thirty, million, people, yielding, a, revenue, of, 4, 000, 000, sterling, equivalent, to, 690, 000, 000, in, 2023, on, the, same, date, clive, obtained, not, only, an, imperial, charter, for, the, company, s, possessions, in, the, carnatic, completing, the, work, he, began, at, arcot, but, a, third, firman, for, the, highest, of, all, the, lieutenancies, of, the, empire, that, of, the, deccan, itself, this, fact, is, mentioned, in, a, letter, from, the, secret, committee, of, the, court, of, directors, to, the, madras, government, dated, 27, april, 1768, the, british, presence, in, india, was, still, tiny, compared, to, the, number, and, strength, of, the, princes, and, people, of, india, but, also, compared, to, the, forces, of, their, ambitious, french, dutch, and, danish, rivals, clive, had, this, in, mind, when, he, penned, his, last, advice, to, the, directors, as, he, finally, left, india, in, 1767, we, are, sensible, that, since, the, acquisition, of, the, dewany, the, power, formerly, belonging, to, the, soubah, of, those, provinces, is, totally, in, fact, vested, in, the, east, india, company, nothing, remains, to, him, but, the, name, and, shadow, of, authority, this, name, however, this, shadow, it, is, indispensably, necessary, we, should, seem, to, venerate, having, thus, founded, the, empire, of, british, india, clive, sought, to, put, in, place, a, strong, administration, the, salaries, of, civil, servants, were, increased, the, acceptance, of, gifts, from, indians, was, forbidden, and, clive, exacted, covenants, under, which, participation, in, the, inland, trade, was, stopped, unfortunately, this, had, very, little, impact, in, reducing, corruption, which, remained, widespread, until, the, days, of, warren, hastings, clive, s, military, reforms, were, more, effective, he, put, down, a, mutiny, of, the, british, officers, who, chose, to, resent, the, veto, against, receiving, presents, and, the, reduction, of, batta, extra, pay, at, a, time, when, two, maratha, armies, were, marching, on, bengal, his, reorganisation, of, the, army, on, the, lines, of, that, which, he, had, begun, after, plassey, neglected, during, his, absence, in, great, britain, subsequently, attracted, the, admiration, of, indian, officers, he, divided, the, whole, army, into, three, brigades, making, each, a, complete, force, in, itself, equal, to, any, single, indian, army, that, could, be, brought, against, it, clive, was, also, instrumental, in, making, the, company, virtual, master, of, north, india, by, introducing, his, policy, of, dual, system, of, government, according, to, the, new, arrangement, enforced, by, him, the, company, became, liable, only, for, revenue, affairs, of, bengal, diwani, and, bihar, while, the, administration, and, law, and, order, was, made, a, prerogative, of, the, nawab, an, office, of, deputy, nawab, was, created, who, was, at, the, helms, of, all, the, affairs, vis, a, vis, revenue, of, two, of, the, richest, provinces, of, india, besides, being, the, company, s, representative, while, the, nizamat, law, and, order, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, nawab, who, appointed, his, own, representative, to, deal, with, the, company, this, system, proved, to, be, detrimental, for, the, administration, of, bengal, and, ultimately, the, dual, system, of, government, was, abolished, by, clive, clive, left, india, for, the, last, time, in, february, 1767, in, 1768, he, lived, at, the, chateau, de, larzac, in, p, zenas, h, rault, languedoc, roussillon, in, southern, france, local, tradition, is, that, he, introduced, local, bakers, to, a, sweet, pastry, petit, p, t, de, p, zenas, and, that, he, or, his, chef, had, brought, the, recipe, from, india, as, a, refined, version, of, the, savoury, keema, naan, p, zenas, is, known, for, such, delicacies, later, in, 1768, clive, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, served, as, treasurer, of, the, royal, salop, infirmary, in, shrewsbury, in, 1769, he, acquired, the, house, and, gardens, of, claremont, near, esher, in, surrey, and, commissioned, capability,

attacks, on, clive, questioned, about, some, of, the, large, sums, of, money, he, had, received, while, in, india, clive, pointed, out, that, they, were, not, contrary, to, accepted, company, practice, and, defended, his, behaviour, by, stating, i, stand, astonished, at, my, own, moderation, given, opportunities, for, greater, gain, the, hearings, highlighted, the, need, for, reform, of, the, company, a, vote, to, censure, clive, for, his, actions, failed, later, in, 1772, clive, was, invested, knight, of, the, bath, eight, years, after, he, had, been, made, knight, bachelor, and, was, appointed, lord, lieutenant, of, shropshire, a, great, famine, between, 1769, and, 1773, reduced, the, population, of, bengal, by, a, third, it, was, argued, that, the, activities, and, aggrandisement, of, company, officials, caused, the, famine, particularly, abuse, of, trade, monopoly, and, land, tax, used, for, the, personal, benefit, of, company, officials, these, revelations, and, subsequent, debates, in, parliament, reduced, clive, s, political, popularity, clive, continued, to, be, involved, in, parliamentary, discussions, on, company, reforms, in, 1773, general, john, burgoyne, one, of, clive, s, most, vocal, critics, pressed, the, case, that, some, of, clive, s, gains, were, made, at, the, expense, of, the, company, and, of, the, government, clive, again, made, a, spirited, defence, of, his, actions, and, closed, his, testimony, by, stating, take, my, fortune, but, save, my, honour, the, vote, that, followed, exonerated, clive, who, was, commended, for, the, great, and, meritorious, service, he, rendered, to, the, country, immediately, thereafter, parliament, began, debating, the, regulating, act, of, 1773, which, significantly, reformed, the, east,

manner, of, his, death, has, long, been, the, subject, of, controversy, no, inquest, was, carried, out, the, absence, of, which, caused, contemporary, newspapers, to, report, his, death, as, due, to, an, apoplectic, fit, or, stroke, 20th, century, biographer, john, watney, concluded, he, did, not, die, from, a, self, inflicted, wound, he, died, as, he, severed, his, jugular, with, a, blunt, paper, knife, brought, on, by, an, overdose, of, drugs, while, clive, left, no, suicide, note, samuel, johnson, wrote, that, he, had, acquired, his, fortune, by, such, crimes, that, his, consciousness, of, them, impelled, him, to, cut, his, own, throat, clive, s, demise, has, been, linked, to, his, history, of, depression, and, to, opium, addiction, but, the, likely, immediate, impetus, was, excruciating, pain, resulting, from, illness, he, was, known, to, suffer, from, gallstones, which, he, had, been, attempting, to, abate, with, opium, according, to, william, dalrymple, clive, suffered, from, acute, depression, from, an, early, age, and, tried, to, take, his, own, life, twice, in, his, youth, during, his, indian, stint, depression, also, troubled, him, he, was, morose, and,
