ashurbanipal, neo, assyrian, akkadian, romanized, a, ur, b, ni, apli, meaning, ashur, is, the, creator, of, the, heir, was, the, king, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, from, 669, bc, to, his, death, in, 631, he, is, generally, remembered, as, the, last, great, king, of, assyria, ashurbanipal, inherited, the, throne, as, the, favored, heir, of, his, father, esarhaddon, his, 38, year, reign, was, among, the, longest, of, any, assyrian, king, though, sometimes, regarded, as, the, apogee, of, ancient, assyria, his, reign, also, marked, the, last, time, assyrian, armies, waged, war, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, and, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, assyrian, dominion, over, the, region, esarhaddon, selected, ashurbanipal, as, heir, c, 673, the, selection, of, ashurbanipal, bypassed, the, elder, son, shamash, shum, ukin, perhaps, in, order, to, avoid, future, rivalry, esarhaddon, designated, shamash, shum, ukin, as, the, heir, to, babylonia, the, two, brothers, jointly, acceded, to, their, respective, thrones, after, esarhaddon, s, death, in, 669, though, shamash, shum, ukin, was, relegated, to, being, ashurbanipal, s, closely, monitored, vassal, much, of, the, early, years, of, ashurbanipal, s, reign, was, spent, fighting, rebellions, in, egypt, which, had, been, conquered, by, his, father, the, most, extensive, campaigns, of, ashurbanipal, were, those, directed, towards, elam, an, ancient, enemy, of, assyria, and, against, shamash, shum, ukin, who, gradually, began, to, resent, the, overbearing, control, that, his, younger, brother, held, over, him, elam, was, defeated, in, a, series, of, conflicts, in, 665, 653, and, 647, 646, shamash, shum, ukin, rebelled, in, 652, and, assembled, a, coalition, of, assyria, s, enemies, but, was, defeated, and, died, during, ashurbanipal, s, siege, of, babylon, in, 648, on, account, of, a, lack, of, surviving, records, much, of, ashurbanipal, s, late, reign, is, poorly, known, ashurbanipal, is, chiefly, remembered, today, for, his, cultural, efforts, a, patron, of, artwork, and, literature, ashurbanipal, was, deeply, interested, in, the, ancient, literary, culture, of, mesopotamia, over, the, course, of, his, long, reign, ashurbanipal, utilized, the, massive, resources, at, his, disposal, to, construct, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, a, collection, of, texts, and, documents, of, various, different, genres, perhaps, comprising, over, 100, 000, texts, at, its, height, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, was, not, surpassed, until, the, construction, of, the, library, of, alexandria, several, centuries, later, the, more, than, 30, 000, cuneiform, texts, that, have, survived, from, the, library, are, a, highly, important, source, on, ancient, mesopotamian, language, religion, literature, and, science, artwork, produced, under, ashurbanipal, was, innovative, in, style, and, motifs, and, is, regarded, to, possess, an, epic, quality, otherwise, absent, from, much, of, the, art, produced, under, previous, kings, ashurbanipal, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, brutal, assyrian, kings, he, was, one, of, the, few, rulers, to, boast, of, his, gory, massacres, of, rebellious, civilians, his, extensive, destruction, of, elam, is, regarded, by, some, scholars, as, a, genocide, the, assyrians, won, many, battles, under, ashurbanipal, campaigning, further, from, the, assyrian, heartland, than, ever, before, but, several, of, his, campaigns, achieved, little, strategic, advantage, ashurbanipal, failed, to, maintain, control, of, egypt, and, his, wars, in, arabia, cost, time, and, resources, without, establishing, longterm, assyrian, control, his, extensive, sack, of, babylon, after, defeating, shamash, shum, ukin, weakened, the, resources, of, the, empire, and, fanned, anti, assyrian, sentiment, in, southern, mesopotamia, perhaps, contributing, to, the, rise, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, five, years, after, ashurbanipal, s, death, whether, ashurbanipal, s, policies, led, to, the, fall, of, the, assyrian, empire, only, two, decades, after, his, death, is, disputed, in, modern, assyriology, a, distorted, legend, of, ashurbanipal, was, remembered, in, greco, roman, literary, tradition, under, the, name, sardanapalus, purportedly, the, effeminate, and, decadent, last, king, of, assyria, whose, vices, led, to, the, fall, of, his, empire, born, c, 685, bc, ashurbanipal, succeeded, his, father, esarhaddon, r, 681, 669, though, ashurbanipal, s, inscriptions, suggest, that, he, was, divinely, preordained, to, rule, his, accession, was, far, from, straightforward, and, its, political, complexities, sowed, the, seeds, for, later, civil, war, ashurbanipal, was, probably, esarhaddon, s, fourth, eldest, son, younger, than, esarhaddon, s, first, crown, prince, sin, nadin, apli, and, the, other, two, sons, shamash, shum, ukin, and, shamash, metu, uballit, he, also, had, an, older, sister, serua, eterat, and, several, younger, brothers, the, assyrian, court, was, thrown, into, upheaval, upon, the, unexpected, death, of, sin, nadin, apli, in, 674, esarhaddon, s, own, father, sennacherib, had, bypassed, esarhaddon, s, elder, brother, arda, mulissu, for, the, crown, and, the, rejected, heir, had, murdered, sennacherib, with, esarhaddon, winning, the, ensuing, civil, war, after, the, death, of, his, own, heir, esarhaddon, quickly, made, new, succession, plans, naming, his, younger, son, ashurbanipal, as, primary, heir, and, emperor, of, assyria, and, his, eldest, surviving, son, shamash, shum, ukin, as, king, of, babylon, southern, mesopotamia, with, the, two, to, rule, as, equal, brothers, he, entirely, bypassed, his, third, eldest, son, shamash, metu, uballit, older, than, ashurbanipal, perhaps, because, of, poor, health, scholars, have, speculated, at, esarhaddon, s, reasons, for, the, divided, succession, which, broke, with, the, assyrian, tradition, of, unitary, rule, the, arrangement, might, have, been, intended, to, assuage, the, elder, shamash, shum, ukin, s, jealousy, toward, his, younger, brother, ashurbanipal, avoiding, future, rivalry, one, hypothesis, is, that, ashurbanipal, s, mother, was, assyrian, while, shamash, shum, ukin, s, was, babylonian, which, might, have, disfavored, him, for, the, assyrian, throne, however, it, is, equally, likely, that, the, two, heirs, shared, a, mother, possibly, esharra, hammat, esarhaddon, s, primary, consort, the, two, princes, arrived, at, the, assyrian, capital, of, nineveh, together, and, partook, in, a, celebration, in, may, 672, with, foreign, representatives, assyrian, nobles, and, military, commanders, since, the, name, ashurbanipal, a, ur, b, ni, apli, means, ashur, is, the, creator, of, the, heir, it, was, likely, bestowed, at, this, time, while, his, previous, name, is, unknown, it, was, also, perhaps, around, this, time, that, ashurbanipal, married, his, future, queen, libbali, sharrat, ashurbanipal, entered, the, house, of, succession, the, palace, of, the, crown, prince, he, began, training, for, his, duties, as, ruler, learning, hunting, riding, scholarship, and, wisdom, archery, chariotry, and, other, military, arts, because, his, father, esarhaddon, was, constantly, ill, during, his, last, few, years, much, of, the, administration, of, the, empire, fell, upon, ashurbanipal, and, shamash, shum, ukin, letters, between, the, two, heirs, from, this, time, show, that, ashurbanipal, managed, the, empire, s, intelligence, network, gathering, strategic, information, from, abroad, and, compiling, reports, for, his, father, ashurbanipal, became, king, of, assyria, in, late, 669, following, esarhaddon, s, death, having, been, crown, prince, for, only, three, years, he, mounted, to, what, may, have, been, the, most, powerful, throne, on, earth, but, his, sovereignty, may, not, have, been, not, secure, his, grandmother, naqi, a, wrote, the, zakutu, treaty, which, bound, the, royal, family, aristocracy, and, all, assyria, to, swear, loyalty, to, ashubanipal, there, however, appears, to, have, been, no, strong, opposition, to, ashurbanipal, s, rise, to, power, shamash, shum, ukin, was, somewhat, belatedly, crowned, king, of, babylon, in, the, spring, of, the, next, year, his, coronation, was, marked, by, ashurbanipal, s, gift, of, the, sacred, statue, of, marduk, stolen, from, babylon, by, sennacherib, twenty, years, before, shamash, shum, ukin, would, rule, babylon, for, sixteen, years, apparently, without, open, conflict, with, his, younger, brother, but, there, would, be, repeated, disagreements, on, the, extent, of, his, independence, esarhaddon, s, succession, decrees, equivocated, on, the, balance, of, power, between, the, two, heirs, ashurbanipal, was, the, primary, heir, to, the, empire, and, shamash, shum, ukin, was, to, swear, allegiance, to, him, but, ashurbanipal, was, not, to, interfere, in, shamash, shum, ukin, s, affairs, ashurbanipal, shifted, the, balance, of, power, in, his, own, favor, perhaps, fearing, that, true, independence, would, give, his, older, brother, the, means, to, threaten, ashubanipal, s, rule, in, 671, ashurbanipal, s, father, esarhaddon, conquered, egypt, defeating, the, kushite, pharaoh, taharqa, the, first, time, egypt, had, been, under, assyrian, rule, it, was, esarhaddon, s, greatest, triumph, and, brought, the, assyrian, empire, to, its, greatest, extent, assyrian, control, of, egypt, was, weak, however, as, taharqa, retreated, south, to, nubia, and, schemed, to, retake, his, lands, esarhaddon, sent, troops, to, garrison, egyptian, cities, and, appointed, local, egyptian, nobles, as, vassal, rulers, of, the, country, in, 669, taharqa, led, egypt, in, a, revolt, against, assyria, and, esarhaddon, left, nineveh, to, meet, the, threat, but, fell, ill, and, died, on, the, way, the, campaign, lapsed, while, ashurbanipal, was, succeeding, to, his, father, s, throne, and, many, of, the, egyptian, vassal, rulers, joined, the, revolt, to, expel, the, foreign, conquerors, after, they, massacred, the, assyrian, garrison, in, memphis, ashurbanipal, sent, an, army, against, the, rebels, on, their, way, to, egypt, the, assyrian, army, collected, tribute, and, military, reinforcements, from, the, various, levantine, vassal, states, including, manasseh, of, judah, and, various, rulers, from, cyprus, the, expeditionary, forces, fought, their, way, through, egypt, winning, a, decisive, battle, at, kar, banitu, in, lower, egypt, according, to, assyrian, sources, taharqa, and, his, supporters, fled, from, memphis, to, thebes, then, escaped, back, to, nubia, and, the, assyrian, army, re, occupied, memphis, some, conspirators, who, had, remained, at, memphis, including, the, local, vassal, ruler, necho, i, were, taken, back, to, assyria, and, after, swearing, new, oaths, of, loyalty, were, unexpectedly, allowed, to, return, and, resume, their, posts, in, egypt, after, taharqa, s, death, in, 664, his, nephew, tantamani, proclaimed, himself, pharaoh, and, invaded, egypt, swiftly, gained, control, of, thebes, and, marched, on, memphis, ashurbanipal, once, again, sent, the, assyrian, army, by, ashurbanipal, s, account, tantamani, fled, south, as, soon, as, the, assyrian, army, entered, egypt, in, retaliation, for, the, repeated, rebellion, the, assyrians, heavily, plundered, thebes, the, sacking, was, the, most, serious, calamity, ever, to, befall, the, ancient, city, one, of, the, major, political, and, religious, centers, in, egypt, the, city, might, have, been, razed, to, the, ground, but, for, the, skillful, diplomacy, of, its, governor, mentuemhat, tantamani, was, not, pursued, beyond, the, egyptian, border, upon, the, return, of, the, assyrian, army, to, nineveh, spoils, from, thebes, were, paraded, through, the, streets, and, many, treasures, and, obelisks, were, refashioned, to, incorporate, into, for, ashurbanipal, s, projects, in, 665, the, elamite, king, urtak, who, had, kept, peaceful, relations, with, esarhaddon, launched, a, surprise, attack, against, babylonia, urtak, was, successfully, driven, back, into, elam, dying, shortly, thereafter, he, was, succeeded, as, elamite, king, by, teumman, who, was, unrelated, to, the, previous, monarch, and, had, to, stabilize, his, rule, by, killing, his, political, rivals, three, of, urtak, s, sons, chief, rival, claimants, to, the, elamite, throne, escaped, to, assyria, and, were, harbored, by, ashurbanipal, despite, teumman, demanding, them, to, be, returned, to, elam, following, the, 665, victory, over, the, elamites, ashurbanipal, had, to, deal, with, a, series, of, revolts, within, his, own, borders, bel, iqisha, chieftain, of, the, gambulians, an, aramean, tribe, in, babylonia, rebelled, after, he, had, been, implicated, as, supporting, the, elamite, invasion, and, was, forced, to, relinquish, some, of, his, authority, little, is, known, of, this, revolt, but, there, is, a, letter, preserved, in, which, ashurbanipal, orders, the, governor, of, uruk, nabu, usabsi, to, attack, bel, iqisha, nabu, usabsi, apparently, claimed, that, bel, iqisha, was, solely, to, blame, for, the, elamite, invasion, bel, iqisha, s, revolt, does, not, appear, to, have, caused, much, damage, and, he, was, killed, shortly, after, revolting, by, a, boar, shortly, thereafter, in, 663, bel, iqisha, s, son, dunanu, also, surrendered, to, ashurbanipal, after, a, long, period, of, peace, teumman, attacked, babylonia, in, 653, because, ashurbanipal, had, not, entrusted, shamash, shum, ukin, with, any, substantial, military, forces, he, was, unable, to, defend, babylonia, against, the, elamite, invasion, and, had, to, rely, on, ashurbanipal, for, military, support, ashurbanipal, s, army, first, advanced, south, and, secured, the, city, of, der, though, teumman, marched, to, meet, the, assyrians, he, soon, changed, his, mind, and, fell, back, to, the, elamite, capital, of, susa, the, final, battle, in, the, war, with, teumman, the, battle, of, ulai, took, place, near, susa, and, was, a, decisive, assyrian, victory, partly, due, to, defections, in, the, elamite, army, teumann, was, killed, in, the, battle, as, was, one, of, his, vassals, shutruk, nahhunte, of, hidalu, in, the, aftermath, of, his, victory, ashurbanipal, installed, two, of, urtak, s, sons, as, rulers, proclaiming, ummanigash, as, king, at, madaktu, and, susa, and, tammaritu, i, as, king, at, hidalu, this, intervention, into, the, elamite, succession, weakened, both, elamite, opposition, towards, assyria, and, elamite, royal, authority, in, his, inscriptions, ashurbanipal, described, his, victory, at, ulai, with, the, following, account, like, the, onset, of, a, terrible, hurricane, i, overwhelmed, elam, in, its, entirety, i, cut, off, the, head, of, teumann, their, king, the, haughty, one, who, plotted, evil, countless, of, his, warriors, i, slew, alive, with, my, hands, i, seized, his, fighters, with, their, corpses, i, filled, the, plain, about, susa, as, with, baltu, and, ashagu, their, blood, i, let, run, down, the, ulai, its, water, i, dyed, red, like, wool, dunanu, who, had, joined, the, elamites, in, the, war, was, captured, alongside, his, family, and, executed, the, gambulians, were, attacked, by, ashurbanipal, s, army, and, brutally, punished, with, their, capital, of, shapibel, being, flooded, and, many, of, its, inhabitants, slaughtered, in, dananu, s, stead, ashurbanipal, appointed, a, noble, called, rimutu, as, the, new, gambulian, chieftain, after, he, had, agreed, to, pay, a, considerable, sum, in, tribute, to, the, assyrian, king, the, cimmerians, a, nomadic, indo, european, people, living, in, the, southern, caucasus, north, of, assyria, had, invaded, assyria, during, the, reign, of, ashurbanipal, s, father, after, esarhaddon, defeated, them, the, cimmerians, turned, to, attack, lydia, in, western, anatolia, ruled, by, gyges, after, allegedly, receiving, advice, from, the, assyrian, national, deity, ashur, in, a, dream, gyges, sent, his, diplomats, to, ask, ashurbanipal, for, assistance, the, assyrians, did, not, even, know, that, lydia, existed, after, the, two, states, successfully, established, communication, with, the, help, of, interpreters, the, cimmerian, invasion, of, lydia, was, defeated, c, 665, two, cimmerian, chiefs, were, imprisoned, in, nineveh, and, large, amounts, of, spoils, were, secured, by, ashurbanipal, s, forces, the, extent, to, which, the, assyrian, army, was, involved, in, the, lydian, campaign, is, unknown, but, it, appears, that, gyges, was, disappointed, with, the, help, since, he, just, twelve, years, later, broke, his, alliance, with, ashurbanipal, and, allied, with, the, increasingly, independent, egypt, instead, after, this, ashurbanipal, cursed, gyges, when, lydia, was, overrun, by, its, enemies, c, 652, 650, there, was, much, rejoicing, in, assyria, while, the, assyrian, forces, were, on, campaign, in, elam, an, alliance, of, persians, cimmerians, and, medes, marched, on, nineveh, and, managed, to, reach, the, city, s, walls, to, counteract, this, threat, ashurbanipal, called, on, his, scythian, allies, and, successfully, defeated, the, enemy, army, the, median, king, phraortes, is, generally, held, to, have, been, killed, in, the, fighting, this, attack, is, poorly, documented, and, it, is, possible, that, phraortes, was, not, present, at, all, and, his, unfortunate, death, instead, belongs, to, a, median, campaign, during, the, reign, of, one, of, ashurbanipal, s, successors, after, his, death, c, 652, gyges, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ardys, because, the, scythians, had, driven, the, cimmerians, from, their, homes, the, cimmerians, invaded, lydia, again, and, successfully, captured, most, of, the, kingdom, as, his, father, had, before, him, ardys, also, sent, for, aid, from, ashurbanipal, stating, that, you, cursed, my, father, and, bad, luck, befell, him, but, bless, me, your, humble, servant, and, i, will, carry, your, yoke, it, is, unknown, if, any, assyrian, aid, arrived, but, lydia, was, successfully, freed, from, the, cimmerians, they, would, not, be, driven, out, of, lydia, completely, until, the, reign, of, ardys, s, grandson, alyattes, although, esarhaddon, s, inscriptions, suggest, that, shamash, shum, ukin, should, have, been, granted, the, entirety, of, babylonia, to, rule, contemporary, records, only, definitely, prove, that, shamash, shum, ukin, held, babylon, itself, and, its, vicinity, the, governors, of, some, babylonian, cities, such, as, nippur, uruk, and, ur, and, the, rulers, in, the, sea, land, all, ignored, the, existence, of, a, king, in, babylon, and, saw, ashurbanipal, as, their, monarch, despite, this, shamash, shum, ukin, had, initially, been, positively, inclined, towards, his, brother, viewing, him, as, his, equal, in, letters, shamash, shum, ukin, addressed, ashurbanipal, simply, as, my, brother, unlike, how, he, addressed, his, father, esarhaddon, the, king, my, father, although, there, are, several, letters, preserved, from, shamash, shum, ukin, to, ashurbanipal, there, are, no, known, replies, it, is, possible, that, ashurbanipal, on, account, of, his, network, of, informers, did, not, feel, a, need, to, write, to, his, brother, by, the, 650s, shamash, shum, ukin, s, opinion, of, ashurbanipal, had, significantly, deteriorated, owing, to, the, increasing, intervention, and, involvement, of, ashurbanipal, in, babylonian, affairs, ashurbanipal, often, delaying, when, help, was, needed, and, growing, dissatisfaction, with, his, position, relative, to, that, of, ashurbanipal, a, letter, written, during, this, time, by, zakir, a, courtier, at, shamash, shum, ukin, s, court, to, ashurbanipal, described, how, visitors, from, the, sea, land, had, publicly, criticized, ashurbanipal, in, front, of, shamash, shum, ukin, using, the, phrase, this, is, not, the, word, of, a, king, zakir, reported, that, though, shamash, shum, ukin, was, angered, he, and, his, governor, of, babylon, ubaru, chose, to, not, take, action, against, the, visitors, aspiring, to, become, independent, of, ashurbanipal, and, free, babylonia, under, his, own, rule, shamash, shum, ukin, revolted, in, 652, according, to, later, aramaic, language, legends, ashurbanipal, and, shamash, shum, ukin, s, sister, serua, eterat, attempted, to, intervene, and, stop, the, two, from, fighting, after, the, war, broke, out, the, legends, hold, that, she, disappeared, into, self, imposed, exile, the, war, between, the, brothers, lasted, for, three, years, in, addition, to, resenting, ashurbanipal, s, overbearing, control, shamash, shum, ukin, s, revolt, was, also, facilitated, by, the, certainty, of, support, in, the, south, the, babylonians, constantly, resented, assyrian, control, and, the, rulers, of, elam, were, certain, allies, always, willing, to, join, anyone, who, waged, war, against, assyria, inscription, evidence, suggests, that, shamash, shum, ukin, addressed, the, citizens, of, babylon, to, join, him, in, his, revolt, in, ashurbanipal, s, inscriptions, shamash, shum, ukin, is, quoted, to, have, said, ashurbanipal, will, cover, with, shame, the, name, of, the, babylonians, which, ashurbanipal, refers, to, as, wind, and, lies, soon, after, shamash, shum, ukin, began, his, revolt, the, rest, of, southern, mesopotamia, rose, up, against, ashurbanipal, alongside, him, the, beginning, of, ashurbanipal, s, account, of, the, conflict, reads, as, follows, in, these, days, shamash, shum, ukin, the, faithless, brother, of, mine, whom, i, had, treated, well, and, had, set, up, as, king, of, babylon, every, imaginable, thing, that, kingship, calls, for, i, made, and, gave, him, soldiers, horses, chariots, i, equipped, and, put, into, his, hands, cities, fields, plantations, together, with, the, people, who, live, therein, i, gave, him, in, larger, numbers, than, my, father, had, ordered, but, he, forgot, this, kindness, i, had, shown, him, and, planned, evil, outwardly, with, his, lips, he, was, speaking, fair, words, while, inwardly, his, heart, was, designing, murder, the, babylonians, who, had, been, loyal, to, assyria, and, faithful, vassals, of, mine, he, deceived, speaking, lies, to, them, according, to, the, inscriptions, of, ashurbanipal, shamash, shum, ukin, was, very, successful, in, finding, allies, ashurbanipal, identified, three, groups, who, aided, his, brother, first, and, foremost, there, were, the, chaldeans, arameans, and, the, other, peoples, of, babylonia, then, there, were, the, elamites, and, lastly, the, kings, of, gutium, amurru, and, meluhha, this, last, group, of, kings, might, refer, to, the, medes, as, gutium, amurru, and, meluhha, no, longer, existed, at, this, point, but, this, is, uncertain, meluhha, might, have, referred, to, egypt, though, the, egyptians, are, not, documented, to, have, aided, shamash, shum, ukin, in, the, war, shamash, shum, ukin, s, ambassadors, to, the, elamites, had, offered, gifts, called, bribes, by, ashurbanipal, and, their, king, ummanigash, sent, an, army, under, the, command, of, undashe, the, son, of, teumman, to, aid, in, the, conflict, for, the, first, two, years, of, the, conflict, battles, were, fought, all, across, babylonia, some, won, by, the, assyrians, and, some, won, by, shamash, shum, ukin, and, his, allies, the, war, quickly, turned, chaotic, several, minor, players, repeatedly, changed, sides, and, both, ashurbanipal, and, shamash, shum, ukin, found, it, difficult, to, keep, track, of, their, allies, among, the, most, notorious, double, agents, were, nabu, bel, shumati, a, governor, of, the, far, south, in, babylonia, whose, repeated, betrayals, enraged, ashurbanipal, despite, this, seemingly, strong, alliance, of, assyrian, enemies, shamash, shum, ukin, failed, to, halt, ashurbanipal, s, advance, as, the, war, progressed, his, forces, were, slowly, defeated, his, allies, diminished, and, his, lands, were, lost, by, 650, the, situation, looked, grim, with, ashurbanipal, s, forces, having, besieged, sippar, borsippa, kutha, and, babylon, itself, during, ashurbanipal, s, siege, of, babylon, the, city, entered, into, a, period, of, famine, ashurbanipal, s, account, of, the, siege, claimed, that, some, of, the, citizens, grew, so, hungry, and, desperate, that, they, ate, their, own, children, having, endured, both, starvation, and, disease, babylon, fell, in, 648, after, a, siege, lasting, two, years, the, city, was, extensively, plundered, by, ashurbanipal, according, to, his, own, inscriptions, ashurbanipal, initiated, a, bloodbath, their, carved, up, bodies, i, fed, to, dogs, to, pigs, to, wolves, to, eagles, to, birds, of, the, heavens, to, fishes, of, the, deep, at, the, time, of, the, city, s, fall, a, great, fire, also, spread, within, babylon, shamash, shum, ukin, is, traditionally, believed, to, have, committed, suicide, by, stepping, into, the, flames, or, by, setting, himself, and, his, family, on, fire, in, his, palace, contemporary, texts, however, only, say, that, he, met, a, cruel, death, and, that, the, gods, consigned, him, to, a, fire, and, destroyed, his, life, in, addition, to, suicide, through, self, immolation, or, other, means, it, is, possible, that, he, was, executed, died, accidentally, or, was, killed, in, some, other, way, if, shamash, shum, ukin, was, executed, it, would, be, logical, for, the, assyrian, scribes, to, leave, this, out, of, historical, records, since, fratricide, killing, a, brother, was, illegal, and, even, if, a, soldier, and, not, ashurbanipal, had, carried, it, out, it, would, still, constitute, a, murder, of, a, member, of, the, assyrian, royal, family, after, shamash, shum, ukin, s, defeat, ashurbanipal, appointed, a, new, vassal, king, of, babylon, kandalanu, of, whom, little, is, known, kandalanu, s, realm, was, the, same, as, shamash, shum, ukin, s, with, the, exception, of, the, city, of, nippur, which, ashurbanipal, converted, into, a, powerful, assyrian, fortress, the, authority, of, kandalanu, is, likely, to, have, been, very, limited, and, few, records, survive, of, his, reign, at, babylon, he, might, have, been, another, one, of, ashurbanipal, s, brothers, or, perhaps, a, babylonian, noble, who, had, allied, with, ashurbanipal, in, the, civil, war, and, had, consequently, been, rewarded, with, the, rank, of, king, kandalanu, probably, lacked, any, true, political, and, military, power, which, was, instead, firmly, in, the, hands, of, ashurbanipal, due, to, the, defeat, and, death, of, a, member, of, the, assyrian, royal, family, the, defeat, of, shamash, shum, ukin, was, ashurbanipal, s, most, problematic, victory, the, civil, war, also, had, significant, broader, consequences, impacting, assyrian, dominion, though, babylonia, slowly, recovered, after, the, war, the, war, exhausted, economic, resources, and, decreased, the, power, and, authority, of, the, assyrian, empire, signs, of, decline, had, already, been, visible, before, the, civil, war, but, its, conclusion, is, regarded, by, modern, historians, to, mark, the, end, of, the, height, of, assyrian, authority, ashurbanipal, s, sack, of, babylon, the, second, extensive, sack, of, the, city, in, thirty, years, also, fanned, anti, assyrian, sentiment, in, southern, babylonia, and, might, thus, have, been, a, decisive, factor, in, the, babylonian, revolt, by, nabopolassar, a, few, years, after, ashurbanipal, s, death, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, and, the, fall, of, assyria, the, elamite, effort, to, support, shamash, shum, ukin, in, the, civil, war, had, largely, come, to, an, end, with, the, early, defeat, of, ummanigash, s, army, near, the, city, of, der, as, a, result, of, ummanigash, s, defeat, he, was, deposed, in, elam, by, tammaritu, ii, who, then, took, the, throne, for, himself, ummanigash, fled, to, the, assyrian, court, where, he, was, granted, asylum, by, ashurbanipal, tammaritu, ii, s, rule, was, brief, and, despite, success, in, some, battles, against, the, assyrians, alongside, the, rogue, governor, nabu, bel, shumati, already, notorious, for, his, role, in, the, war, with, shamash, shum, ukin, he, was, deposed, in, another, revolt, in, 649, the, new, king, indabibi, had, an, extremely, brief, reign, and, was, murdered, after, ashurbanipal, threatened, to, invade, elam, again, because, of, the, kingdom, s, role, in, supporting, shamash, shum, ukin, and, his, other, enemies, in, indabibi, s, stead, humban, haltash, iii, became, king, in, elam, nabu, bel, shumati, continued, fighting, against, ashurbanipal, from, outposts, within, elam, and, though, humban, haltash, was, in, favor, of, giving, up, the, chaldean, rebel, nabu, bel, shumati, had, too, many, supporters, in, elam, in, order, for, this, to, go, through, because, humban, haltash, could, thus, not, respond, to, ashurbanipal, s, threats, the, assyrians, invaded, elam, again, in, 647, after, the, elamite, defense, collapsed, humban, haltash, abandoned, his, seat, at, madaktu, and, fled, into, the, mountains, he, was, briefly, replaced, as, king, by, tammaritu, ii, who, regained, his, throne, after, the, assyrians, had, plundered, the, region, of, khuzestan, they, returned, home, prompting, humban, haltash, to, reemerge, from, the, mountains, and, retake, the, throne, the, assyrians, returned, to, elam, in, 646, and, humban, haltash, again, abandoned, madaktu, fleeing, first, to, the, city, dur, untash, and, then, into, the, mountains, in, eastern, elam, ashurbanipal, s, forces, pursued, him, plundering, and, razing, cities, on, their, way, all, major, political, centers, in, elam, were, crushed, and, nearby, chiefdoms, and, petty, kingdoms, who, had, previously, paid, tribute, to, the, elamite, king, began, paying, tribute, to, ashurbanipal, instead, among, these, kingdoms, was, parsua, possibly, a, predecessor, of, the, empire, that, would, be, founded, by, the, achaemenids, a, century, later, parsua, s, king, cyrus, possibly, the, same, person, as, cyrus, i, the, grandfather, of, cyrus, the, great, had, originally, sided, with, the, elamites, at, the, beginning, of, the, campaign, and, had, thus, been, forced, to, supply, his, son, arukku, as, a, hostage, countries, which, had, never, previously, had, contact, with, the, assyrians, such, as, a, kingdom, ruled, by, a, king, called, udimiri, which, extended, beyond, elam, also, began, paying, tribute, to, the, assyrians, for, the, first, time, on, their, way, back, from, their, campaign, the, assyrian, forces, brutally, plundered, susa, in, ashurbanipal, s, triumphant, inscriptions, detailing, the, sack, it, is, described, in, great, detail, recounting, how, the, assyrians, desecrated, the, royal, tombs, looted, and, razed, temples, stole, the, statues, of, the, elamite, gods, and, sowed, salt, in, the, ground, the, ancient, elamite, capital, was, wiped, off, the, face, of, the, earth, and, ashurbanipal, then, continued, with, the, destruction, of, elamite, settlements, on, a, massive, scale, in, addition, to, the, destruction, of, numerous, cities, thousands, of, those, elamites, who, were, not, killed, were, deported, away, from, their, homeland, ashurbanipal, s, brutal, suppression, of, elam, is, sometimes, considered, a, genocide, the, detail, and, length, of, ashurbanipal, s, inscriptions, concerning, the, destructions, suggest, that, the, events, were, meant, to, shock, the, world, signalling, the, defeat, and, eradication, of, the, elamites, as, a,

after, humban, haltash, was, deposed, captured, and, sent, to, the, assyrians, in, a, revolt, shortly, thereafter, assyrian, records, cease, to, speak, of, elam, elam, was, ultimately, unable, to, ever, fully, recover, from, ashurbanipal, s, efforts, in, 646, and, was, left, open, to, attack, from, tribes, and, kings, in, the, surrounding, lands, eventually, disappearing, altogether, from, the, historical, record, assyrian, interests, in, the, levant, and, other, western, territories, were, at, times, challenged, on, account, of, arab, tribal, groups, raiding, assyrian, territories, or, disrupting, trade, on, occasion, the, assyrian, army, intervened, deposing, and, replacing, problematic, tribal, rulers, ashurbanipal, oversaw, two, campaigns, against, arab, tribes, though, their, chronology, is, somewhat, uncertain, and, his, narrative, of, these, conflicts, was, altered, over, the, course, of, his, later, reign, the, arabian, campaigns, have, received, relatively, little, attention, from, modern, historians, but, they, are, the, conflicts, with, the, most, lengthy, and, detailed, accounts, in, ashurbanipal, s, own, writings, ashurbanipal, s, first, campaign, against, the, arabs, was, conducted, some, time, before, the, war, with, shamash, shum, ukin, primarily, against, the, qedarites, ashurbanipal, s, earliest, account, of, his, campaign, against, the, qedarites, was, created, in, 649, and, describes, how, yauta, son, of, hazael, king, of, the, qedarites, revolted, against, ashurbanipal, together, with, another, arab, king, ammuladdin, and, plundered, the, western, lands, of, the, assyrian, empire, according, to, ashurbanipal, s, account, the, assyrian, army, together, with, the, army, of, kamas, halta, of, moab, defeated, the, rebel, forces, ammuladdin, was, captured, and, sent, in, chains, to, assyria, but, yauta, escaped, in, the, place, of, yauta, a, loyal, arabian, warlord, called, abiyate, was, granted, kingship, of, the, qedarites, ashurbanipal, s, account, of, this, conflict, is, markedly, different, from, the, accounts, of, his, other, campaigns, the, phrase, in, my, n, th, campaign, otherwise, always, used, is, missing, the, defeat, of, the, enemy, is, explicitly, attributed, to, the, army, rather, than, to, ashurbanipal, personally, and, yauta, escapes, rather, than, being, captured, and, or, executed, a, second, version, of, the, narrative, composed, a, year, later, also, includes, that, ashurbanipal, defeated, adiya, a, queen, of, the, arabs, and, that, yauta, fled, to, another, chieftain, natnu, of, the, nabayyate, who, refused, him, and, remained, loyal, to, ashurbanipal, even, later, versions, of, the, narrative, also, include, mentions, of, how, yauta, previously, revolted, against, esarhaddon, years, prior, these, later, accounts, also, explicitly, connect, yauta, s, rebellion, to, the, revolt, of, shamash, shum, ukin, placing, it, at, the, same, time, and, suggesting, that, the, western, raids, by, the, arabs, were, prompted, by, the, instability, caused, by, the, assyrian, civil, war, in, both, accounts, the, qedarite, lands, were, thoroughly, plundered, at, the, conclusion, of, the, war, some, of, the, arab, tribal, leaders, joined, shamash, shum, ukin, in, the, assyrian, civil, war, among, them, were, abiyate, made, king, by, ashurbanipal, s, forces, and, his, brother, aya, ammu, who, sent, soldiers, to, babylonia, because, of, ashurbanipal, s, focus, on, elam, they, initially, escaped, retaliation, and, punishment, as, the, elamite, wars, dragged, on, several, arab, rulers, ceased, to, pay, tribute, to, ashurbanipal, and, began, raiding, nearby, assyrian, settlements, severely, disrupting, trade, this, development, proved, enough, for, ashurbanipal, s, generals, to, organize, a, major, campaign, to, restore, order, ashurbanipal, s, account, of, this, conflict, largely, concerns, the, movements, of, his, army, through, syria, in, search, of, uiate, conflated, with, yauta, but, possibly, a, different, person, and, his, arabian, soldiers, according, to, the, account, the, assyrian, army, marched, from, syria, to, damascus, and, then, on, to, hulhuliti, after, which, they, captured, abiyate, and, defeated, u, o, and, akko, the, assyrians, were, reportedly, faced, with, great, difficulties, during, this, war, on, account, of, the, unfamiliar, and, hostile, terrain, the, nabayyate, who, had, aided, ashurbanipal, in, the, previous, campaign, are, mentioned, as, being, defeated, in, the, second, war, against, the, arabs, without, any, further, information, on, what, had, led, to, the, change, in, their, relationship, between, the, two, campaigns, the, last, known, version, of, the, arabian, narrative, specifies, the, two, campaigns, as, together, composing, ashurbanipal, s, ninth, campaign, and, further, expands, them, with, more, details, in, this, version, abiyate, and, ammuladdin, are, specified, to, have, joined, shamash, shum, ukin, ashurbanipal, is, in, this, version, also, for, the, first, time, personally, credited, with, the, victories, of, the, campaign, this, later, version, also, states, that, uiate, was, captured, and, paraded, in, nineveh, together, with, prisoners, captured, during, the, wars, in, elam, that, uiate, was, hitched, up, to, ashurbanipal, s, chariot, like, a, horse, and, that, aya, ammu, was, flayed, alive, supposedly, spoils, brought, back, from, the, arabian, campaigns, were, so, extensive, that, they, caused, inflation, in, the, assyrian, empire, and, famine, in, arabia, despite, this, and, despite, being, impressive, in, the, sense, that, no, previous, assyrian, ruler, had, campaigned, against, the, arabs, with, the, same, vigor, ashurbanipal, s, arabian, campaigns, are, sometimes, assessed, as, a, strategic, blunder, the, two, wars, were, time, consuming, wasted, valuable, resources, and, failed, to, consolidate, assyrian, rule, over, any, of, the, lands, they, took, place, in, the, end, of, ashurbanipal, s, reign, and, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, his, son, and, successor, ashur, etil, ilani, is, shrouded, in, mystery, on, account, of, a, lack, of, available, sources, events, in, ashurbanipal, s, reign, after, 649, are, relatively, poorly, recorded, since, the, secure, eponym, canon, known, assyrian, year, names, ends, in, that, year, after, 639, only, two, inscriptions, by, ashurbanipal, are, known, a, sharp, contrast, to, the, abundant, records, known, from, previous, years, this, scarcity, of, documentation, might, reflect, the, beginning, of, a, serious, internal, political, crisis, ashurbanipal, s, late, reign, appears, to, have, seen, a, growing, disconnect, between, the, king, and, the, traditional, elite, of, the, empire, ashurbanipal, heavily, promoted, eunuchs, to, prominent, positions, to, the, detriment, of, the, nobility, and, aristocracy, at, some, point, late, in, his, reign, the, chief, singer, bullutu, was, made, eponym, an, unprecedented, and, perhaps, self, indulgent, move, some, assyriologists, such, as, eckart, frahm, have, drawn, parallels, between, the, sparse, evidence, from, ashurbanipal, s, late, reign, and, sardanapalus, in, greco, roman, literary, tradition, the, decadent, last, king, of, assyria, based, on, ashurbanipal, ashurbanipal, himself, recognized, that, he, had, failed, to, maintain, the, durability, of, the, assyrian, empire, in, one, of, his, final, known, inscriptions, ashurbanipal, saddened, and, faced, with, his, own, mortality, due, to, illness, lamented, the, state, of, his, empire, this, inscriptions, reads, i, cannot, do, away, with, the, strife, in, my, country, and, the, dissensions, in, my, family, disturbing, scandals, oppress, me, always, illness, of, mind, and, flesh, bow, me, down, with, cries, of, woe, i, bring, my, days, to, an, end, on, the, day, of, the, city, god, the, day, of, the, festival, i, am, wretched, death, is, seizing, hold, upon, me, and, bears, me, down, in, addition, to, internal, strife, it, is, clear, that, the, hold, of, the, assyrian, empire, on, its, peripheral, regions, had, severely, weakened, by, the, end, of, ashurbanipal, s, reign, some, peripheral, lands, had, regained, independence, there, was, for, instance, no, longer, an, assyrian, presence, in, the, southern, levant, where, the, egyptians, had, instead, become, the, hegemonic, power, ashurbanipal, s, late, reign, may, have, also, seen, the, beginning, of, rebellious, movements, in, babylonia, precursors, of, that, of, nabopolassar, egypt, already, regained, independence, in, the, middle, of, ashurbanipal, s, reign, egypt, appears, to, have, been, liberated, peacefully, and, gradually, under, necho, i, s, son, and, successor, psamtik, i, who, had, been, educated, at, the, assyrian, court, after, becoming, king, in, 664, as, a, loyal, assyrian, vassal, psamtik, slowly, extended, his, control, across, all, of, egypt, unifying, the, country, in, 656, and, initiating, a, period, of, renaissance, and, prosperity, eventually, becoming, fully, independent, of, ashurbanipal, psamtik, remained, an, ally, of, assyria, during, the, later, medo, babylonian, conquest, of, the, assyrian, empire, in, the, reign, of, sinsharishkun, ashur, etil, ilani, s, successor, and, another, son, of, ashurbanipal, both, psamtik, and, his, son, necho, ii, rushed, to, assyria, s, aid, with, egyptian, armies, fighting, alongside, the, assyrians, inscriptions, by, ashur, etil, ilani, suggest, that, his, father, died, a, natural, death, but, do, not, shed, light, on, when, or, how, this, happened, though, his, final, year, is, often, erroneously, given, as, 627, or, even, 626, this, follows, an, estimate, from, an, inscription, written, nearly, a, century, later, at, harran, by, adad, guppi, the, mother, of, the, neo, babylonian, king, nabonidus, r, 556, 539, the, final, contemporary, evidence, for, ashurbanipal, being, alive, and, reigning, as, king, is, a, contract, from, nippur, made, in, 631, if, ashurbanipal, s, reign, had, ended, in, 627, the, inscriptions, of, his, successors, ashur, etil, ilani, and, sinsharishkun, in, babylon, covering, several, years, would, have, been, impossible, given, that, the, city, was, seized, by, nabopolassar, in, 626, and, never, again, fell, into, assyrian, hands, to, get, the, attested, lengths, of, the, reigns, of, his, successors, to, match, it, is, generally, agreed, that, ashurbanipal, either, died, abdicated, or, was, deposed, in, 631, or, 630, 631, is, typically, favored, as, the, year, of, his, death, ashurbanipal, was, succeeded, as, king, by, ashur, etil, ilani, and, he, seems, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, succession, plans, of, his, father, despite, its, consequences, given, that, sinsharishkun, was, granted, the, fortress, city, of, nippur, and, was, designated, to, be, the, successor, of, kandalanu, at, babylon, once, kandalanu, died, a, handful, of, historians, have, attempted, to, justify, a, reign, of, ashurbanipal, extending, to, 627, though, no, such, proposal, is, without, problems, it, is, possible, that, the, 42, year, rather, than, 38, year, error, came, about, in, later, mesopotamian, historiography, on, account, of, the, knowledge, that, ashurbanipal, ruled, concurrently, with, babylonian, rulers, shamash, shum, ukin, and, kandalanu, whose, reigns, together, amount, to, 42, years, but, kandalanu, survived, ashurbanipal, by, three, years, actually, dying, in, 627, one, possible, way, to, justify, a, 42, year, reign, of, ashurbanipal, is, by, assuming, there, was, a, coregency, between, him, and, ashur, etil, ilani, but, there, had, never, been, a, coregency, in, prior, assyrian, history, and, the, idea, is, explicitly, contradicted, by, ashur, etil, ilani, s, own, inscriptions, which, describe, him, as, becoming, king, after, the, end, of, his, father, s, reign, another, once, popular, idea, for, instance, favored, by, stefan, zawadzki, is, that, ashurbanipal, and, kandalanu, were, the, same, person, kandalanu, simply, being, the, name, the, king, used, in, babylon, this, idea, is, generally, considered, unlikely, for, several, reasons, most, notably, that, no, previous, assyrian, king, is, known, to, have, used, an, alternate, name, in, babylon, and, that, inscriptions, from, babylonia, show, a, difference, in, the, lengths, of, the, reigns, of, ashurbanipal, and, kandalanu, ashurbanipal, s, reign, is, counted, from, his, first, full, year, as, king, 668, and, kandalanu, s, is, counted, from, his, first, full, year, as, king, 647, all, assyrian, kings, who, personally, ruled, babylon, used, the, title, king, of, babylon, in, their, inscriptions, but, that, title, is, not, used, in, any, of, ashurbanipal, s, inscriptions, even, those, made, after, 648, most, importantly, babylonian, documents, clearly, treat, ashurbanipal, and, kandalanu, as, two, different, people, key, male, female, king, ashurbanipal, was, already, married, to, his, queen, libb, li, arrat, akkadian, at, the, time, of, his, accession, to, the, throne, perhaps, marrying, her, around, the, time, of, his, proclamation, as, crown, prince, the, marriage, occurring, around, that, time, is, supported, by, libbali, sharrat, s, name, which, she, is, attested, under, before, the, death, of, esarhaddon, the, name, is, unique, not, known, to, have, been, borne, by, any, other, individual, and, incorporates, the, element, arratum, queen, indicating, that, it, was, not, her, birth, name, but, rather, a, name, perhaps, assumed, upon, her, marriage, to, ashurbanipal, libbali, sharrat, is, most, famous, for, her, appearance, in, the, so, called, garden, party, relief, from, ashurbanipal, s, palace, which, depicts, her, and, ashurbanipal, dining, together, the, scene, is, noteworthy, for, being, organized, around, libbali, sharrat, rather, than, ashurbanipal, and, for, being, the, only, known, image, from, ancient, assyria, depicting, an, individual, other, than, the, king, effectively, holding, court, and, even, hosting, the, king, three, of, ashurbanipal, s, children, are, known, by, name, all, sons, libbali, sharrat, was, presumably, the, mother, of, ashurbanipal, s, immediate, successors, ashur, etil, ilani, and, sinsharishkun, ninurtas, sharru, usur, s, less, prominent, role, probably, derived, from, him, being, the, son, of, a, lower, wife, libbali, sharrat, might, have, lived, for, some, time, after, ashurbanipal, s, death, in, 631, since, there, is, a, tablet, dating, to, ashur, etil, ilani, s, reign, referencing, the, mother, of, the, king, the, inscriptions, of, sinsharishkun, which, mention, him, being, selected, for, the, kingship, from, among, his, equals, i, e, brothers, suggest, that, ashurbanipal, had, more, sons, in, addition, to, the, three, known, by, name, it, is, also, known, that, ashurbanipal, had, at, least, one, daughter, given, that, there, are, documents, from, his, reign, that, reference, a, daughter, of, the, king, ashurbanipal, s, lineage, may, have, survived, the, fall, of, assyria, in, 612, 609, the, mother, of, the, last, neo, babylonian, king, nabonidus, adad, guppi, was, from, harran, and, had, assyrian, ancestry, according, to, her, own, inscriptions, adad, guppi, was, born, in, the, 20th, year, of, ashurbanipal, s, reign, 648, as, years, were, counted, from, the, king, s, first, full, year, british, scholar, stephanie, dalley, considers, it, almost, certain, that, adad, guppi, was, a, daughter, of, ashurbanipal, on, account, of, her, own, inscriptions, claiming, that, nabonidus, was, of, ashurbanipal, s, dynastic, line, american, professor, of, biblical, studies, michael, b, dick, has, refuted, this, pointing, out, that, even, though, nabonidus, did, go, to, some, length, to, revive, some, old, assyrian, symbols, such, as, wearing, a, wrapped, cloak, in, his, depictions, absent, in, those, of, other, neo, babylonian, kings, but, present, in, assyrian, art, and, attempted, to, link, himself, to, the, sargonid, dynasty, there, is, no, evidence, whatsoever, that, nabonidus, was, related, to, the, sargonid, dynasty, in, assyrian, royal, ideology, the, assyrian, king, was, the, divinely, appointed, mortal, representative, of, ashur, the, king, was, seen, as, having, the, moral, humane, and, necessary, obligation, to, extend, assyria, since, lands, outside, assyria, were, regarded, to, be, uncivilized, and, a, threat, to, the, cosmic, and, divine, order, within, the, assyrian, empire, expansionism, was, cast, as, a, moral, duty, to, convert, chaos, to, civilization, rather, than, exploitative, imperialism, because, of, the, assyrian, king, s, role, as, ashur, s, representative, resistance, or, rebellion, against, assyrian, rule, was, seen, as, fighting, against, divine, will, which, deserved, punishment, assyrian, royal, ideology, perceived, rebels, as, criminals, against, the, divine, world, order, though, the, royal, ideology, could, thus, be, used, to, justify, enacting, brutal, punishments, against, assyria, s, enemies, levels, of, brutality, and, aggression, varied, considerably, between, kings, and, modern, scholars, do, not, view, ancient, assyria, as, a, whole, as, an, unusually, brutal, civilization, sargon, ii, the, founder, of, ashurbanipal, s, dynasty, is, for, instance, known, for, several, times, forgiving, and, sparing, defeated, enemies, most, kings, only, enacted, brutal, acts, against, enemy, soldiers, or, elites, not, against, civilians, under, ashurbanipal, the, assyrian, army, campaigned, further, away, from, the, assyrian, heartland, than, ever, before, though, ashurbanipal, contrary, to, the, image, presented, in, some, of, his, reliefs, and, sharply, contrasting, with, his, predecessors, probably, only, rarely, if, at, all, participated, in, the, military, campaigns, during, his, reign, he, clearly, stands, out, among, the, assyrian, kings, for, his, exceptional, brutality, it, is, possible, that, ashurbanipal, s, excessive, brutality, can, be, partially, explained, through, religious, zealotry, he, is, known, to, have, rebuilt, repaired, and, expanded, a, majority, of, the, major, shrines, throughout, his, empire, and, many, of, the, actions, he, took, during, his, reign, were, due, to, omen, reports, something, he, was, very, interested, in, he, also, appointed, two, of, his, younger, brothers, ashur, mukin, paleya, and, ashur, etel, shame, erseti, muballissu, as, priests, in, the, cities, assur, and, harran, respectively, when, taking, all, neo, assyrian, reliefs, depicting, scenes, of, brutality, together, the, highest, concentration, of, them, are, from, ashurbanipal, s, reign, reliefs, with, brutality, scenes, from, ashurbanipal, s, time, account, for, 35, of, all, known, such, depictions, from, the, neo, assyrian, period, ashurbanipal, is, also, the, most, brutal, king, in, terms, of, the, variety, of, different, scenes, depicted, he, is, one, of, only, four, neo, assyrian, kings, alongside, esarhaddon, tiglath, pileser, iii, and, ashurnasirpal, ii, who, in, their, inscriptions, claimed, to, have, killed, civilians, and, the, one, with, the, most, varied, acts, against, them, including, live, flaying, dismemberment, and, impalement, there, are, also, several, instances, where, he, is, recorded, to, have, brought, captive, enemies, to, nineveh, to, enthusiastically, torture, and, humiliate, them, women, were, rarely, depicted, being, harmed, in, assyrian, artwork, but, ashurbanipal, s, reliefs, include, some, prominent, exceptions, to, this, rule, one, of, the, reliefs, from, ashurbanipal, s, palace, in, nineveh, given, the, modern, designation, bm, 124927, includes, both, dead, female, bodies, and, direct, attacks, against, women, the, middle, part, of, the, relief, includes, the, most, brutal, act, against, a, woman, ever, recorded, in, an, assyrian, relief, assyrian, soldiers, ripping, open, a, pregnant, arab, woman, ashurbanipal, portrayed, himself, as, powerful, in, both, body, and, mind, typically, portraying, himself, as, carrying, both, weapons, and, a, stylus, ashurbanipal, s, inscriptions, make, him, out, to, be, unlike, the, kings, before, him, exceptionally, well, versed, in, literature, writing, mathematics, and, scholarship, deeply, interested, in, the, ancient, literary, culture, of, mesopotamia, ashurbanipal, read, complex, texts, in, both, akkadian, and, sumerian, already, in, his, youth, after, he, became, king, ashurbanipal, using, the, massive, resources, now, at, his, disposal, created, the, world, s, first, universal, library, in, nineveh, the, resulting, library, of, ashurbanipal, is, regarded, to, have, been, by, far, the, most, extensive, library, in, ancient, assyria, and, the, first, systematically, organized, library, in, the, world, in, total, it, encompassed, perhaps, more, than, 100, 000, texts, and, it, was, not, surpassed, in, size, until, the, creation, of, the, library, of, alexandria, centuries, later, around, 30, 000, of, the, documents, in, the, library, survived, the, destruction, of, nineveh, in, 612, and, have, been, excavated, among, the, city, s, ruins, the, library, was, assembled, at, ashurbanipal, s, command, with, scribes, being, sent, out, throughout, the, empire, to, collect, and, copy, texts, of, every, type, and, genre, from, the, libraries, of, the, temples, most, of, the, collected, texts, were, observations, of, events, and, omens, texts, detailing, the, behavior, of, certain, men, and, of, animals, texts, on, the, movements, of, celestial, objects, and, so, forth, present, in, the, library, were, also, dictionaries, for, sumerian, akkadian, and, other, languages, and, many, religious, texts, such, as, rituals, fables, prayers, and, incantations, in, addition, the, tablets, were, organized, by, shape, such, as, four, sided, tablets, recorded, financial, transactions, while, round, tablets, recorded, agricultural, information, the, tablets, were, separated, by, subject, identified, by, colored, marks, and, written, descriptions, and, placed, in, different, rooms, the, library, contained, many, tablets, from, babylonia, both, donated, and, taken, as, war, booty, ashurbanipal, s, library, probably, represented, a, comprehensive, and, accurate, picture, of, mesopotamian, learning, up, until, his, time, ashurbanipal, himself, considered, the, library, to, be, the, signature, accomplishment, of, his, reign, in, his, inscriptions, he, boasted, of, his, own, intelligence, and, the, library, s, construction, i, ashurbanipal, king, of, the, universe, on, whom, the, gods, have, bestowed, intelligence, who, has, acquired, penetrating, acumen, for, the, most, recondite, details, of, scholarly, erudition, none, of, my, predecessors, having, any, comprehension, of, such, matters, i, have, placed, these, tablets, for, the, future, in, the, library, at, nineveh, for, my, life, and, for, the, well, being, of, my, soul, to, sustain, the, foundations, of, my, royal, name, the, library, was, long, remembered, in, mesopotamia, as, late, as, in, the, first, century, ad, scribes, in, babylonia, still, referred, to, the, long, lost, library, in, some, of, their, texts, and, letters, most, of, the, traditional, mesopotamian, stories, and, tales, known, today, such, as, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, en, ma, eli, the, babylonian, creation, myth, erra, the, myth, of, etana, and, the, epic, of, anzu, only, survived, until, the, modern, era, because, they, were, included, in, ashurbanipal, s, library, the, library, covered, the, entire, spectrum, of, ashurbanipal, s, literary, interests, and, also, included, folk, tales, such, as, the, poor, man, of, nippur, a, predecessor, of, one, of, the, tales, in, one, thousand, and, one, nights, handbooks, and, scientific, texts, the, library, was, excavated, in, nineveh, by, austen, henry, layard, his, assistant, hormuzd, rassam, and, w, k, loftus, in, 1853, the, library, tablets, have, been, on, display, in, the, british, museum, since, their, discovery, and, continue, to, this, day, as, of, 2024, regarded, as, a, patron, of, the, arts, ashurbanipal, erected, numerous, sculptures, and, reliefs, in, his, palaces, in, nineveh, depicting, the, most, important, events, from, his, long, reign, ashurbanipal, s, artwork, was, innovative, in, terms, of, assyrian, art, history, often, having, an, epic, quality, unlike, much, of, the, more, static, artwork, produced, under, his, predecessors, a, motif, appearing, in, several, of, ashurbanipal, s, art, pieces, for, instance, the, lion, hunt, of, ashurbanipal, is, the, king, killing, lions, a, propaganda, image, illustrating, his, glory, and, power, as, well, as, his, ability, to, safeguard, the, assyrian, people, through, slaying, dangerous, animals, various, new, elements, can, be, seen, in, artwork, produced, under, ashurbanipal, the, regalia, of, the, king, changes, from, relief, to, relief, depending, on, the, scene, depicted, informal, events, for, instance, typically, depict, ashurbanipal, with, an, open, crown, design, different, from, the, typical, vaguely, bucket, shaped, assyrian, crown, there, are, no, known, examples, of, art, depicting, ashurbanipal, seated, on, a, throne, or, holding, court, a, common, motif, under, previous, kings, perhaps, meaning, that, the, symbol, of, the, throne, was, losing, its, status, in, art, and, possible, also, at, court, during, his, reign, ashurbanipal, s, artwork, is, the, only, ancient, assyrian, art, that, depicts, non, assyrian, foreigners, as, physically, different, not, only, in, their, equipment, and, outfits, but, also, in, their, features, from, assyrians, possibly, influenced, by, egyptian, art, which, did, depict, foreigners, differently, ashurbanipal, s, reliefs, show, elamites, and, urartians, as, stockier, urartians, with, larger, noses, and, arabs, with, long, straight, hair, in, contrast, to, the, curly, hair, of, the, assyrians, inscriptions, and, annals, from, ashurbanipal, s, time, however, offer, no, evidence, that, foreigners, were, seen, as, racially, or, ethnically, different, in, terms, of, biology, or, physiognomy, which, means, that, this, might, only, have, been, an, artistic, choice, tales, of, ashurbanipal, survived, in, the, cultural, memory, of, the, near, east, for, centuries, after, the, decline, of, assyrian, power, in, the, region, he, is, almost, certainly, identifiable, with, the, figure, asnappar, mentioned, in, the, biblical, book, of, ezra, 4, 10, it, is, also, either, esarhaddon, or, ashurbanipal, who, is, the, king, of, assyria, mentioned, in, the, book, of, 2, chronicles, 33, 11, ashurbanipal, has, also, been, most, commonly, identified, as, the, assyrian, king, nebuchadnezzar, in, the, book, of, judith, ashurbanipal, and, other, ancient, assyrian, kings, and, figures, continued, to, appear, in, the, folklore, and, literary, tradition, of, northern, mesopotamia, the, most, prominent, later, legend, concerning, ashurbanipal, was, the, long, lived, greco, roman, sardanapalus, legend, the, sardanapalus, of, legend, was, according, to, the, assyriologist, maria, de, f, tima, rosa, conceived, as, more, effeminate, than, a, woman, a, lascivious, and, idle, man, a, governor, who, loathed, all, expressions, of, militarism, and, war, this, view, stemmed, from, ancient, greek, views, on, mesopotamia, in, general, ancient, mesopotamian, kings, were, typically, seen, by, the, greeks, as, effeminate, and, dull, despots, incapable, of, securing, the, welfare, for, the, people, of, their, empires, the, earliest, known, reference, to, sardanapalus, comes, from, the, 5th, century, bce, histories, of, herodotus, which, includes, a, reference, to, the, riches, of, sardanapalus, king, of, nineveh, legendary, tales, in, aramaic, based, on, the, civil, war, between, ashurbanipal, sarbanabal, and, shamash, shum, ukin, sarmuge, are, attested, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, most, elaborate, and, lengthy, ancient, text, concerning, sardanapalus, comes, from, the, 1st, century, bce, bibliotheca, historica, of, diodorus, siculus, siculus, s, portrayal, of, sardanapalus, was, endowed, with, ancient, greek, orientalism, the, king, was, stated, to, have, lived, among, women, dressed, like, them, used, a, soft, voice, and, engaged, in, other, activities, viewed, as, unnatural, for, greek, men, in, siculus, s, account, sardanapalus, s, satrap, of, media, arbaces, saw, him, mingling, with, women, in, the, palace, and, quickly, revolted, assaulting, nineveh, together, with, the, babylonian, priest, belesys, after, failing, to, urge, his, soldiers, to, defend, the, city, sardanapalus, locked, himself, in, his, palace, chamber, with, treasures, and, concubines, and, lit, up, a, pyre, burning, down, the, entire, capital, city, and, ending, the, assyrian, empire, it, is, clear, from, the, narrative, that, siculus, s, sardanapalus, is, based, not, only, on, ashurbanipal, but, also, on, shamash, shum, ukin, and, sinsharishkun, the, greek, account, of, ancient, assyria, transformed, historical, perception, of, the, ancient, empire, and, set, the, image, of, it, in, western, europe, for, centuries, since, concrete, evidence, of, assyria, and, babylonia, was, lacking, authors, and, artists, during, the, renaissance, and, enlightenment, based, their, interpretations, of, ancient, mesopotamia, on, classical, greco, roman, writings, in, late, 17th, century, italy, the, composer, domenico, freschi, wrote, and, performed, the, opera, sardanapalo, a, comedic, tragedy, wherein, sardanapalus, was, portrayed, as, a, woman, like, and, sex, eager, king, in, the, opera, sardanapalus, after, watching, nineveh, crumble, decides, to, light, fire, to, his, palace, so, that, the, assyrian, empire, did, not, fall, without, a, show, in, 1821, lord, byron, launched, the, historical, tragedy, play, sardanapalus, which, pairs, sardanapalus, with, the, legendary, character, myrrah, often, sardanapalus, s, counterpart, in, later, tales, as, well, myrrah, was, in, the, story, a, female, greek, slave, and, loyal, supporter, of, sardanapalus, in, byron, s, version, it, was, myrrah, who, lit, the, palace, on, fire, after, sardanapalus, gave, his, last, words, adieu, assyria, i, loved, thee, well, many, operas, inspired, by, byron, included, similar, storylines, it, was, typical, to, portray, the, fall, of, nineveh, and, assyria, as, a, consequence, of, assyria, s, supposed, lack, of, moral, values, combined, with, its, ostentation, and, pomp, even, after, archaeologists, and, historians, began, to, uncover, the, true, history, of, ancient, assyria, in, the, 19th, century, the, perception, rooted, in, greco, roman, tradition, proved, to, be, enduring, when, the, british, archaeologist, austen, henry, layard, found, evidence, of, a, major, fire, in, the, ruins, of, nimrud, which, he, believed, to, be, nineveh, in, 1845, his, colleagues, suggested, that, this, was, proof, of, the, sardanapalus, legend, even, after, discoveries, made, it, clear, that, the, sardanapalus, of, legend, was, far, from, a, perfect, match, of, the, ashurbanipal, of, history, the, legend, was, not, forgotten, instead, plays, and, films, featuring, sardanapalus, simply, began, to, mix, the, legendary, tale, with, historical, details, many, plays, began, to, incorporate, assyrian, architectural, details, such, as, lamassus, two, films, based, on, the, sardanapalus, legend, have, been, produced, in, italy, giuseppe, de, liguoro, s, sardanapalo, re, dell, assiria, 1910, and, silvio, amadio, s, le, sette, folgori, di, assur, 1962, both, heavily, influenced, by, byron, s, play, both, follow, sardanapalus, s, relationship, with, myrrah, in, amadio, s, film, the, narrative, is, also, inspired, by, ashurbanipal, s, conflict, with, shamash, shum, ukin, who, appears, in, the, film, under, the, shortened, name, shamash, the, north, palace, of, nineveh, constructed, by, ashurbanipal, was, rediscovered, by, the, british, funded, assyrian, archaeologist, hormuzd, rassam, in, december, 1853, rassam, s, excavations, were, a, somewhat, strange, episode, in, assyriology, as, his, efforts, were, also, marked, by, an, intense, rivalry, with, the, french, archaeologist, victor, place, despite, agreements, as, to, who, should, excavate, where, ashurbanipal, s, palace, was, found, by, rassam, during, the, night, when, he, sent, out, a, team, of, excavators, under, the, cover, of, darkness, to, dig, in, the, french, portion, of, the, nineveh, excavation, excavations, were, conducted, in, the, palace, in, 1853, 1854, among, other, discoveries, rassam, recovered, the, reliefs, making, up, the, lion, hunt, of, ashurbanipal, which, were, taken, from, the, palace, and, transported, to, the, british, museum, reaching, england, in, march, 1856, because, of, scholarly, disagreements, and, rivalries, as, well, as, issues, of, funding, studies, and, publications, of, the, finds, from, ashurbanipal, s, palace, were, produced, slowly, with, the, first, detailed, analyses, and, studies, not, being, published, until, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, ashurbanipal, s, reign, was, the, last, time, when, assyrian, armies, campaigned, all, across, the, middle, east, he, is, consequently, typically, regarded, to, have, been, the, last, great, king, of, assyria, ashurbanipal, s, reign, is, sometimes, considered, the, apogee, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, though, many, scholars, instead, consider, the, preceding, reign, of, esarhaddon, as, such, whether, ashurbanipal, is, to, blame, for, the, fall, of, the, assyrian, empire, relatively, quickly, after, his, death, is, disputed, j, a, delaunay, author, of, the, encyclopaedia, iranica, entry, on, ashurbanipal, writes, that, the, neo, assyrian, empire, under, ashurbanipal, had, already, begun, exhibiting, clear, symptoms, of, impending, dislocation, and, fall, while, donald, john, wiseman, in, the, encyclopaedia, britannica, article, on, ashurbanipal, holds, that, it, is, no, indictment, of, his, rule, that, his, empire, fell, within, two, decades, after, his, death, this, was, due, to, external, pressures, rather, than, to, internal, strife, g, rard, chaliand, holds, that, the, fall, of, the, assyrian, empire, should, be, blamed, on, ashurbanipal, s, mediocre, heirs, rather, than, ashurbanipal, himself, there, is, however, no, evidence, that, his, heirs, were, incompetent, rulers, sinsharishkun, under, whom, the, empire, collapsed, was, a, militarily, competent, ruler, utilizing, the, same, tactics, as, his, predecessors, eckart, frahm, believes, the, seeds, of, assyria, s, fall, were, sown, in, ashurbanipal, s, reign, in, particular, through, the, disconnect, between, the, king, and, the, traditional, elite, and, through, ashurbanipal, s, sack, of, babylon, ashurbanipal, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, pieces, of, artwork, created, in, modern, times, in, 1958, surrealist, painter, leonora, carrington, painted, assurbanipal, abluting, harpies, an, oil, on, canvas, at, the, israel, museum, depicting, ashurbanipal, pouring, a, white, substance, onto, the, heads, of, pigeon, like, creatures, with, human, faces, a, statue, of, the, king, called, ashurbanipal, was, created, by, sculptor, fred, parhad, in, 1988, and, placed, on, a, street, near, the, san, francisco, city, hall, the, statue, cost, 100, 000, and, was, described, as, the, first, sizable, bronze, statue, of, ashurbanipal, it, was, presented, to, the, city, of, san, francisco, as, a, gift, from, the, assyrian, people, on, may, 29, 1988, parhad, being, of, assyrian, descent, some, local, assyrians, expressed, fears, that, the, statue, resembled, the, legendary, mesopotamian, hero, gilgamesh, more, than, it, resembled, the, actual, ashurbanipal, parhad, defended, the, statue, as, representing, ashurbanipal, though, explained, that, he, had, taken, some, artistic, liberties, ashurbanipal, has, also, made, occasional, appearances, in, popular, culture, in, various, media, robert, e, howard, wrote, a, short, story, entitled, the, fire, of, asshurbanipal, first, published, in, the, december, 1936, issue, of, weird, tales, magazine, about, an, accursed, jewel, belonging, to, a, king, of, long, ago, whom, the, grecians, called, sardanapalus, and, the, semitic, peoples, asshurbanipal, the, mesopotamians, a, 2007, song, by, they, might, be, giants, mentions, ashurbanipal, alongside, sargon, hammurabi, and, gilgamesh, ashurbanipal, was, used, as, the, ruler, of, the, assyrians, in, the, game, civilization, v, ashurbanipal, once, more, entered, the, global, spotlight, and, garnered, increased, fame, in, 2018, when, reliefs, from, his, reign, were, exhibited, at, the, british, museum, in, the, exhibition, i, am, ashurbanipal, 8, november, 2018, 21, february, 2019, the, exhibition, was, well, received, particularly, due, to, its, use, of, inventive, technology, such, as, using, lights, to, illustrate, how, many, of, ashurbanipal, s, reliefs, would, have, been, painted, in, his, lifetime, and, its, acknowledgement, of, the, colonialist, history, of, the, collection, itself, there, was, however, also, substantial, controversy, associated, with, the, exhibition, due, to, its, sponsorship, by, the, oil, and, gas, company, bp, involved, in, middle, eastern, oil, since, the, early, 20th, century, the, opening, of, the, exhibition, in, november, 2018, was, met, with, protests, with, protesters, chanting, slogans, relating, to, bp, s, exploitation, of, iraqi, natural, resources, and, pretending, to, sip, oil, contaminated, champagne, in, an,
