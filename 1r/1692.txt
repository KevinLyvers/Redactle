jean, louis, rodolphe, agassiz, s, i, ag, see, french, frs, for, frse, may, 28, 1807, december, 14, 1873, was, a, swiss, born, american, biologist, and, geologist, who, is, recognized, as, a, scholar, of, earth, s, natural, history, spending, his, early, life, in, switzerland, he, received, a, phd, at, erlangen, and, a, medical, degree, in, munich, after, studying, with, georges, cuvier, and, alexander, von, humboldt, in, paris, agassiz, was, appointed, professor, of, natural, history, at, the, university, of, neuch, tel, he, emigrated, to, the, united, states, in, 1847, after, visiting, harvard, university, he, went, on, to, become, professor, of, zoology, and, geology, at, harvard, to, head, its, lawrence, scientific, school, and, to, found, its, museum, of, comparative, zoology, agassiz, is, known, for, observational, data, gathering, and, analysis, he, made, institutional, and, scientific, contributions, to, zoology, geology, and, related, areas, including, multivolume, research, books, running, to, thousands, of, pages, he, is, particularly, known, for, his, contributions, to, ichthyological, classification, including, of, extinct, species, such, as, megalodon, and, to, the, study, of, historical, geology, including, the, founding, of, glaciology, his, theories, on, human, animal, and, plant, polygenism, have, been, criticised, as, implicitly, supporting, scientific, racism, louis, agassiz, was, born, in, the, village, of, m, tier, fr, now, part, of, haut, vully, which, merged, into, mont, vully, in, 2016, in, the, swiss, canton, of, fribourg, he, was, the, son, of, a, pastor, louis, rudolphe, and, his, wife, rose, mayor, his, father, was, a, protestant, clergyman, as, had, been, his, progenitors, for, six, generations, and, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, physician, and, an, intellectual, in, her, own, right, who, had, assisted, her, husband, in, the, education, of, her, boys, he, was, educated, at, home, until, he, spent, four, years, at, secondary, school, in, bienne, which, he, entered, in, 1818, and, completed, his, elementary, studies, in, lausanne, agassiz, studied, at, the, universities, of, z, rich, heidelberg, and, munich, at, the, last, one, he, extended, his, knowledge, of, natural, history, especially, of, botany, in, 1829, he, received, the, degree, of, doctor, of, philosophy, at, erlangen, and, in, 1830, that, of, doctor, of, medicine, at, munich, moving, to, paris, he, came, under, the, tutelage, of, alexander, von, humboldt, and, later, received, his, financial, benevolence, humboldt, and, georges, cuvier, launched, him, on, his, careers, of, respectively, geology, and, zoology, ichthyology, soon, became, a, focus, of, agassiz, s, life, s, work, in, 1819, to, 1820, the, german, biologists, johann, baptist, von, spix, and, carl, friedrich, philipp, von, martius, undertook, an, expedition, to, brazil, they, returned, home, to, europe, with, many, natural, objects, including, an, important, collection, of, the, freshwater, fish, of, brazil, especially, of, the, amazon, river, spix, who, died, in, 1826, likely, from, a, tropical, disease, did, not, live, long, enough, to, work, out, the, history, of, those, fish, and, martius, selected, agassiz, for, this, project, agassiz, threw, himself, into, the, work, with, an, enthusiasm, that, would, go, on, to, characterize, the, rest, of, his, life, s, work, the, task, of, describing, the, brazilian, fish, was, completed, and, published, in, 1829, it, was, followed, by, research, into, the, history, of, fish, found, in, lake, neuch, tel, enlarging, his, plans, he, in, 1830, issued, a, prospectus, of, a, history, of, the, freshwater, fish, of, central, europe, in, 1839, however, the, first, part, of, the, publication, appeared, and, it, was, completed, in, 1842, in, november, 1832, agassiz, was, appointed, professor, of, natural, history, at, the, university, of, neuch, tel, at, a, salary, of, about, us, 400, and, declined, brilliant, offers, in, paris, because, of, the, leisure, for, private, study, that, that, position, afforded, him, the, fossil, fish, in, the, rock, of, the, surrounding, region, the, slates, of, glarus, and, the, limestones, of, monte, bolca, soon, attracted, his, attention, at, the, time, very, little, had, been, accomplished, in, their, scientific, study, agassiz, as, early, as, 1829, planned, the, publication, of, a, work, more, than, any, other, it, would, lay, the, foundation, of, his, worldwide, fame, five, volumes, of, his, recherches, sur, les, poissons, fossiles, research, on, fossil, fish, were, published, from, 1833, to, 1843, they, were, magnificently, illustrated, chiefly, by, joseph, dinkel, in, gathering, materials, for, that, work, agassiz, visited, the, principal, museums, in, europe, meeting, cuvier, in, paris, he, received, much, encouragement, and, assistance, from, him, in, 1833, he, married, cecile, braun, the, sister, of, his, friend, alexander, braun, and, established, his, household, at, neuch, tel, trained, to, scientific, drawing, by, her, brothers, his, wife, was, of, the, greatest, assistance, to, agassiz, with, some, of, the, most, beautiful, plates, in, fossil, and, freshwater, fishes, being, drawn, by, her, agassiz, found, that, his, palaeontological, analyses, required, a, new, ichthyological, classification, the, fossils, that, he, examined, rarely, showed, any, traces, of, the, soft, tissues, of, fish, but, instead, consisted, chiefly, of, the, teeth, scales, and, fins, with, the, bones, being, perfectly, preserved, in, comparatively, few, instances, he, therefore, adopted, a, classification, that, divided, fish, into, four, groups, ganoids, placoids, cycloids, and, ctenoids, based, on, the, nature, of, the, scales, and, other, dermal, appendages, that, did, much, to, improve, fish, taxonomy, but, agassiz, s, classification, has, since, been, superseded, with, louis, de, coulon, both, father, and, son, he, founded, the, societ, des, sciences, naturelles, of, which, he, was, the, first, secretary, and, in, conjunction, with, the, coulons, also, arranged, a, provisional, museum, of, natural, history, in, the, orphan, s, home, agassiz, needed, financial, support, to, continue, his, work, the, british, association, and, the, earl, of, ellesmere, then, lord, francis, egerton, stepped, in, to, help, the, 1290, original, drawings, made, for, the, work, were, purchased, by, the, earl, and, presented, by, him, to, the, geological, society, of, london, in, 1836, the, wollaston, medal, was, awarded, to, agassiz, by, the, council, of, that, society, for, his, work, on, fossil, ichthyology, in, 1838, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, meanwhile, invertebrate, animals, engaged, his, attention, in, 1837, he, issued, the, prodrome, of, a, monograph, on, the, recent, and, fossil, echinodermata, the, first, part, of, which, appeared, in, 1838, in, 1839, 1840, he, published, two, quarto, volumes, on, the, fossil, echinoderms, of, switzerland, and, in, 1840, 1845, he, issued, his, tudes, critiques, sur, les, mollusques, fossiles, critical, studies, on, fossil, mollusks, before, agassiz, s, first, visit, to, england, in, 1834, hugh, miller, and, other, geologists, had, brought, to, light, the, remarkable, fossil, fish, of, the, old, red, sandstone, of, the, northeast, of, scotland, the, strange, forms, of, pterichthys, coccosteus, and, other, genera, were, then, made, known, to, geologists, for, the, first, time, they, were, of, intense, interest, to, agassiz, and, formed, the, subject, of, a, monograph, by, him, published, in, 1844, 1, 45, monographie, des, poissons, fossiles, du, vieux, gr, s, rouge, ou, syst, me, d, vonien, old, red, sandstone, des, les, britanniques, et, de, russie, monograph, on, fossil, fish, of, the, old, red, sandstone, or, devonian, system, of, the, british, isles, and, of, russia, in, the, early, stages, of, his, career, in, neuchatel, agassiz, also, made, a, name, for, himself, as, a, man, who, could, run, a, scientific, department, well, under, his, care, the, university, of, neuch, tel, soon, became, a, leading, institution, for, scientific, inquiry, in, 1842, to, 1846, agassiz, issued, his, nomenclator, zoologicus, a, classification, list, with, references, of, all, names, used, in, zoological, genera, and, groups, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1843, the, vacation, of, 1836, was, spent, by, agassiz, and, his, wife, in, the, little, village, of, bex, where, he, met, jean, de, charpentier, and, ignaz, venetz, their, recently, announced, glacial, theories, had, startled, the, scientific, world, and, agassiz, returned, to, neuch, tel, as, an, enthusiastic, convert, in, 1837, agassiz, proposed, that, the, earth, had, been, subjected, to, a, past, ice, age, he, presented, the, theory, to, the, helvetic, society, that, ancient, glaciers, flowed, outward, from, the, alps, and, even, larger, glaciers, had, covered, the, plains, and, mountains, of, europe, asia, and, north, america, and, smothered, the, entire, northern, hemisphere, in, a, prolonged, ice, age, in, the, same, year, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, before, that, proposal, goethe, de, saussure, ignaz, venetz, jean, de, charpentier, karl, friedrich, schimper, and, others, had, studied, the, glaciers, of, the, alps, and, goethe, charpentier, and, schimper, had, even, concluded, that, the, erratic, blocks, of, alpine, rocks, scattered, over, the, slopes, and, summits, of, the, jura, mountains, had, been, moved, there, by, glaciers, those, ideas, attracted, the, attention, of, agassiz, and, he, discussed, them, with, charpentier, and, schimper, whom, he, accompanied, on, successive, trips, to, the, alps, agassiz, even, had, a, hut, constructed, upon, one, of, the, aar, glaciers, and, for, a, time, made, it, his, home, to, investigate, the, structure, and, movements, of, the, ice, agassiz, visited, england, and, with, william, buckland, the, only, english, naturalist, who, shared, his, ideas, made, a, tour, of, the, british, isles, in, search, of, glacial, phenomena, and, became, satisfied, that, his, theory, of, an, ice, age, was, correct, in, 1840, agassiz, published, a, two, volume, work, tudes, sur, les, glaciers, studies, on, glaciers, in, it, he, discussed, the, movements, of, the, glaciers, their, moraines, and, their, influence, in, grooving, and, rounding, the, rocks, and, in, producing, the, striations, and, roches, moutonn, es, seen, in, alpine, style, landscapes, he, accepted, charpentier, and, schimper, s, idea, that, some, of, the, alpine, glaciers, had, extended, across, the, wide, plains, and, valleys, of, the, aar, and, rh, ne, but, he, went, further, by, concluding, that, in, the, recent, past, switzerland, had, been, covered, with, one, vast, sheet, of, ice, originating, in, the, higher, alps, and, extending, over, the, valley, of, northwestern, switzerland, to, the, southern, slopes, of, the, jura, the, publication, of, the, work, gave, fresh, impetus, to, the, study, of, glacial, phenomena, in, all, parts, of, the, world, familiar, then, with, recent, glaciation, agassiz, and, the, english, geologist, william, buckland, visited, the, mountains, of, scotland, in, 1840, there, they, found, clear, evidence, in, different, locations, of, glacial, action, the, discovery, was, announced, to, the, geological, society, of, london, in, successive, communications, the, mountainous, districts, of, england, wales, and, ireland, were, understood, to, have, been, centres, for, the, dispersion, of, glacial, debris, agassiz, remarked, that, great, sheets, of, ice, resembling, those, now, existing, in, greenland, once, covered, all, the, countries, in, which, unstratified, gravel, boulder, drift, is, found, that, this, gravel, was, in, general, produced, by, the, trituration, of, the, sheets, of, ice, upon, the, subjacent, surface, etc, in, his, later, years, agassiz, applied, his, glacial, theories, to, the, geology, of, the, brazilian, tropics, including, the, amazon, agassiz, began, with, a, working, hypothesis, which, could, be, tested, by, the, results, of, fieldwork, to, find, either, inconclusive, or, conclusively, supporting, or, refuting, evidence, a, hypothesis, that, can, be, conclusively, refuted, is, better, than, a, hypothesis, that, is, difficult, to, test, agassiz, had, a, close, association, with, his, student, and, field, assistant, the, geologist, charles, hartt, who, eventually, refuted, agassiz, s, theories, about, the, amazon, based, on, his, fieldwork, there, instead, of, evidence, for, any, glacial, processes, he, found, chemically, weathered, sediments, from, marine, and, tropical, fluvial, not, glacial, processes, a, finding, that, later, geologists, confirmed, agassiz, hypothesis, that, the, amazon, was, affected, by, the, last, glacial, maximum, was, correct, although, the, mechanism, causing, the, effect, was, non, glacial, the, amazon, rainforest, was, split, into, two, large, blocks, by, extensive, savanna, during, the, lgm, with, the, aid, of, a, grant, of, money, from, the, king, of, prussia, agassiz, crossed, the, atlantic, in, the, autumn, of, 1846, to, investigate, the, natural, history, and, geology, of, north, america, and, to, deliver, a, course, of, lectures, on, the, plan, of, creation, as, shown, in, the, animal, kingdom, by, invitation, from, john, amory, lowell, at, the, lowell, institute, in, boston, massachusetts, the, financial, offers, that, were, presented, to, him, in, the, united, states, induced, him, to, settle, there, where, he, remained, to, the, end, of, his, life, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1846, in, 1846, still, married, to, cecilie, who, remained, with, their, three, children, in, switzerland, agassiz, met, elizabeth, cabot, cary, at, a, dinner, the, two, developed, a, romantic, attachment, and, when, his, wife, died, in, 1848, they, made, plans, to, marry, the, ceremony, took, place, on, april, 25, 1850, in, boston, massachusetts, at, king, s, chapel, agassiz, brought, his, children, to, live, with, them, and, elizabeth, raised, and, developed, close, relationships, with, her, step, children, she, had, no, children, of, her, own, agassiz, had, a, mostly, cordial, relationship, with, the, harvard, botanist, asa, gray, despite, their, disagreements, agassiz, believed, each, human, race, had, been, separately, created, but, gray, a, supporter, of, charles, darwin, believed, in, the, shared, evolutionary, ancestry, of, all, humans, in, addition, agassiz, was, a, member, of, the, scientific, lazzaroni, a, group, of, mostly, physical, scientists, who, wanted, american, academia, to, mimic, the, more, autocratic, academic, structures, of, european, universities, but, gray, was, a, staunch, opponent, of, that, group, agassiz, s, engagement, for, the, lowell, institute, lectures, precipitated, the, establishment, in, 1847, of, the, lawrence, scientific, school, at, harvard, university, with, agassiz, as, its, head, harvard, appointed, him, professor, of, zoology, and, geology, and, he, founded, the, museum, of, comparative, zoology, there, in, 1859, and, served, as, its, first, director, until, his, death, in, 1873, during, his, tenure, at, harvard, agassiz, studied, the, effect, of, the, last, ice, age, in, north, america, in, august, 1857, agassiz, was, offered, the, chair, of, palaeontology, in, the, museum, of, natural, history, paris, which, he, refused, he, was, later, decorated, with, the, cross, of, the, legion, of, honor, agassiz, continued, his, lectures, for, the, lowell, institute, in, succeeding, years, he, gave, lectures, on, ichthyology, 1847, 1848, comparative, embryology, 1848, 1849, functions, of, life, in, lower, animals, 1850, 1851, natural, history, 1853, 1854, methods, of, study, in, natural, history, 1861, 1862, glaciers, and, the, ice, period, 1864, 1865, brazil, 1866, 1867, and, deep, sea, dredging, 1869, 1870, in, 1850, he, had, married, elizabeth, cabot, cary, who, later, wrote, introductory, books, about, natural, history, and, a, lengthy, biography, of, her, husband, after, he, had, died, agassiz, served, as, a, nonresident, lecturer, at, cornell, university, while, he, was, also, on, faculty, at, harvard, in, 1852, he, accepted, a, medical, professorship, of, comparative, anatomy, at, charlestown, massachusetts, but, he, resigned, in, two, years, from, then, on, agassiz, s, scientific, studies, dropped, off, but, he, became, one, of, the, best, known, scientists, in, the, world, by, 1857, agassiz, was, so, well, loved, that, his, friend, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, wrote, the, fiftieth, birthday, of, agassiz, in, his, honor, and, read, it, at, a, dinner, given, for, agassiz, by, the, saturday, club, in, cambridge, agassiz, s, own, writing, continued, with, four, of, a, planned, 10, volumes, of, natural, history, of, the, united, states, published, from, 1857, to, 1862, he, also, published, a, catalog, of, papers, in, his, field, bibliographia, zoologiae, et, geologiae, in, four, volumes, between, 1848, and, 1854, stricken, by, ill, health, in, the, 1860s, agassiz, resolved, to, return, to, the, field, for, relaxation, and, to, resume, his, studies, of, brazilian, fish, in, april, 1865, he, led, the, thayer, expedition, to, brazil, while, there, he, commissioned, two, photographers, augusto, stahl, and, georges, leuzinger, to, accompany, the, expedition, and, produce, somatological, images, of, indigenous, people, and, enslaved, africans, and, black, people, after, his, return, in, august, 1866, an, account, of, the, expedition, a, journey, in, brazil, was, published, in, 1868, in, december, 1871, he, made, a, second, eight, month, excursion, known, as, the, hassler, expedition, under, the, command, of, commander, philip, carrigan, johnson, the, brother, of, eastman, johnson, and, visited, south, america, on, its, southern, atlantic, and, pacific, seaboards, the, ship, explored, the, magellan, strait, which, drew, the, praise, of, charles, darwin, following, the, establishment, of, the, first, u, s, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, in, new, york, city, in, 1866, agassiz, was, called, on, to, help, settle, disputes, about, animal, behavior, he, deemed, the, way, turtles, were, shipped, caused, them, suffering, while, p, t, barnum, argued, with, agassiz, support, that, his, snakes, would, eat, only, live, animals, his, second, wife, elizabeth, cary, agassiz, assisted, him, in, preparing, his, a, journey, in, brazil, along, with, her, stepson, alexander, agassiz, she, wrote, seaside, studies, in, natural, history, and, marine, animals, of, massachusetts, elizabeth, wrote, at, the, strait, that, the, hassler, pursued, her, course, past, a, seemingly, endless, panorama, of, mountains, and, forests, rising, into, the, pale, regions, of, snow, and, ice, where, lay, glaciers, in, which, every, rift, and, crevasse, as, well, as, the, many, cascades, flowing, down, to, join, the, waters, beneath, could, be, counted, as, she, steamed, by, them, these, were, weeks, of, exquisite, delight, to, agassiz, the, vessel, often, skirted, the, shore, so, closely, that, its, geology, could, be, studied, from, the, deck, from, his, first, marriage, to, cecilie, braun, agassiz, had, two, daughters, ida, and, pauline, and, a, son, alexander, in, 1863, agassiz, s, daughter, ida, married, henry, lee, higginson, who, later, founded, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, and, was, a, benefactor, to, harvard, and, other, schools, on, november, 30, 1860, agassiz, s, daughter, pauline, was, married, to, quincy, adams, shaw, 1825, 1908, a, wealthy, boston, merchant, and, later, a, benefactor, to, the, boston, museum, of, fine, arts, pauline, agassiz, shaw, later, became, a, prominent, educator, suffragist, and, philanthropist, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, agassiz, worked, to, establish, a, permanent, school, in, which, zoological, science, could, be, pursued, amid, the, living, subjects, of, its, study, in, 1873, the, private, philanthropist, john, anderson, gave, agassiz, the, island, of, penikese, in, buzzards, bay, massachusetts, south, of, new, bedford, and, presented, him, with, 50, 000, to, endow, it, permanently, as, a, practical, school, of, natural, science, that, would, be, especially, devoted, to, the, study, of, marine, zoology, the, school, collapsed, soon, after, agassiz, s, death, but, is, considered, to, be, a, precursor, of, the, nearby, woods, hole, marine, biological, laboratory, agassiz, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, american, branches, of, his, two, fields, and, taught, many, future, scientists, who, would, go, on, to, prominence, including, alpheus, hyatt, david, starr, jordan, joel, asaph, allen, joseph, le, conte, ernest, ingersoll, william, james, charles, sanders, peirce, nathaniel, shaler, samuel, hubbard, scudder, alpheus, packard, and, his, son, alexander, emanuel, agassiz, he, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, paleontologist, charles, doolittle, walcott, and, the, natural, scientist, edward, s, morse, agassiz, had, a, reputation, for, being, a, demanding, teacher, he, would, allegedly, lock, a, student, up, in, a, room, full, of, turtle, shells, or, lobster, shells, or, oyster, shells, without, a, book, or, a, word, to, help, him, and, not, let, him, out, till, he, had, discovered, all, the, truths, which, the, objects, contained, two, of, agassiz, s, most, prominent, students, detailed, their, personal, experiences, under, his, tutelage, scudder, in, a, short, magazine, article, for, every, saturday, and, shaler, in, his, autobiography, those, and, other, recollections, were, collected, and, published, by, lane, cooper, in, 1917, which, ezra, pound, would, draw, on, for, his, anecdote, of, agassiz, and, the, sunfish, in, the, early, 1840s, agassiz, named, two, fossil, fish, species, after, mary, anning, acrodus, anningiae, and, belenostomus, anningiae, and, another, after, her, friend, elizabeth, philpot, anning, was, a, paleontologist, known, around, the, world, for, important, finds, but, because, of, her, gender, she, was, often, not, formally, recognized, for, her, work, agassiz, was, grateful, for, the, help, that, the, women, gave, him, in, examining, fossil, fish, specimens, during, his, visit, to, lyme, regis, in, 1834, agassiz, died, in, cambridge, massachusetts, in, 1873, and, was, buried, on, the, bellwort, path, at, mount, auburn, cemetery, joined, later, by, his, wife, his, monument, is, a, boulder, from, a, glacial, moraine, of, the, aar, near, the, site, of, the, old, h, tel, des, neuch, telois, not, far, from, the, spot, where, his, hut, once, stood, his, grave, is, sheltered, by, pine, trees, from, his, old, home, in, switzerland, the, cambridge, elementary, school, north, of, harvard, university, was, named, in, his, honor, and, the, surrounding, neighborhood, became, known, as, agassiz, as, a, result, the, school, s, name, was, changed, to, the, maria, l, baldwin, school, on, may, 21, 2002, because, of, concerns, about, agassiz, s, involvement, in, scientific, racism, and, to, honor, maria, louise, baldwin, the, african, american, principal, of, the, school, who, served, from, 1889, to, 1922, the, neighborhood, however, continued, to, be, known, as, agassiz, c, 2009, neighborhood, residents, decided, to, rename, the, neighborhood, s, community, council, as, the, agassiz, baldwin, community, then, in, july, 2021, culminating, a, two, year, effort, on, the, part, of, neighborhood, residents, the, cambridge, city, council, voted, unanimously, to, change, the, name, to, the, baldwin, neighborhood, an, elementary, school, the, agassiz, elementary, school, in, minneapolis, minnesota, existed, from, 1922, to, 1981,

to, the, study, of, the, cryosphere, on, earth, or, elsewhere, in, the, solar, system, agassiz, took, part, in, a, monthly, gathering, called, the, saturday, club, at, the, parker, house, a, meeting, of, boston, writers, and, intellectuals, he, was, therefore, mentioned, in, a, stanza, of, the, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, poem, at, the, saturday, club, there, at, the, table, s, further, end, i,

thee, her, darling, whom, we, call, our, agassiz, in, 1850, agassiz, commissioned, daguerreotypes, which, were, described, as, haunting, and, voyeuristic, of, the, enslaved, renty, taylor, and, taylor, s, daughter, delia, to, further, his, arguments, about, black, inferiority, they, are, the, earliest, known, photographs, of, enslaved, persons, agassiz, left, the, images, to, harvard, and, they, remained, in, the, peabody, museum, s, attic, until, 1976, when, they, were, rediscovered, by, ellie, reichlin, a, former, staff, member, the, 15, daguerrotypes, were, in, a, case, with, the, embossing, j, t, zealy, photographer, columbia, with, several, handwritten, labels, which, helped, in, later, identification, reichlin, spent, months, doing, research, to, try, to, identify, the, people, in, the, photos, but, harvard, university, did, not, make, efforts, to, contact, the, families, and, licensed, the, photos, for, use, in, 2011, tamara, lanier, wrote, a, letter, to, the, president, of, harvard, that, identified, herself, as, a, direct, descendant, of, the, taylors, and, asked, the, university, to, turn, over, the, photos, to, her, in, 2019, taylor, s, descendants, sued, harvard, for, the, return, of, the, images, and, unspecified, damages, the, lawsuit, was, supported, by, 43, living, descendants, of, agassiz, who, wrote, in, a, letter, of, support, for, harvard, to, give, the, daguerreotypes, to, ms, lanier, and, her, family, would, begin, to, make, amends, for, its, use, of, the, photos, as, exhibits, for, the, white, supremacist, theory, agassiz, espoused, everyone, must, evaluate, fully, his, role, in, promoting, a, pseudoscientific, justification, for, white, supremacy, aggasiz, zeally, gallery, agassiz, was, a, well, known, natural, scientist, of, his, generation, in, america, in, addition, to, being, a, natural, scientist, agassiz, wrote, prolifically, in, the, field, of, scientific, polygenism, after, he, came, to, the, united, states, upon, arriving, in, boston, in, 1846, agassiz, spent, a, few, months, acquainting, himself, with, the, northeast, region, of, the, united, states, he, spent, much, of, his, time, with, samuel, george, morton, a, famous, american, anthropologist, at, the, time, who, became, well, known, by, analyzing, fossils, brought, back, by, lewis, and, clark, one, of, morton, s, personal, projects, involved, studying, cranial, capacity, of, human, skulls, from, around, the, world, morton, aimed, to, use, craniometry, to, prove, that, white, people, were, biologically, superior, to, other, races, his, work, crania, aegyptiaca, claimed, to, support, the, polygenism, belief, that, the, races, were, created, separately, and, each, had, their, own, unique, attributes, morton, relied, on, other, scientists, to, send, him, skulls, along, with, information, about, where, they, were, acquired, factors, that, can, affect, cranial, capacity, such, as, body, size, and, gender, were, not, taken, into, consideration, by, morton, he, made, questionable, judgment, calls, such, as, dismissing, hindu, skull, calculations, from, his, caucasian, cranial, measurements, because, they, brought, the, overall, average, down, oppositely, he, included, peruvian, skull, measurements, alongside, native, american, calculations, even, though, the, peruvian, numbers, lowered, the, average, score, despite, morton, s, unsound, methods, his, published, work, on, cranial, capacities, across, races, was, deemed, authoritative, in, the, united, states, and, europe, morton, is, a, primary, influence, on, agassiz, s, belief, in, polygenism, john, amory, lowell, invited, agassiz, to, present, twelve, lectures, in, december, 1846, on, three, subjects, titled, the, plan, of, creation, as, shown, in, the, animal, kingdom, ichthyology, and, comparative, embryology, as, a, part, of, the, lowell, lecture, series, these, lectures, were, widely, attended, with, up, to, 5, 000, people, in, attendance, on, some, nights, it, was, during, these, lectures, that, agassiz, announced, for, the, first, time, that, black, and, white, people, had, different, origins, but, were, part, of, the, same, species, agassiz, repeated, this, lecture, 10, months, later, to, the, charleston, literary, club, but, changed, his, original, stance, claiming, that, black, people, were, physiologically, and, anatomically, a, distinct, species, agassiz, believed, that, humans, did, not, descend, from, one, single, common, ancestor, he, believed, that, like, plants, and, animals, various, regions, have, differentiated, species, of, humans, he, considered, this, hypothesis, testable, and, matched, to, the, available, evidence, he, also, indicated, that, there, were, obvious, geographical, barriers, that, were, the, likely, cause, of, speciation, stephen, jay, gould, asserted, that, agassiz, s, observations, sprang, from, racist, bias, in, particular, from, his, revulsion, on, first, encountering, african, americans, in, the, united, states, referencing, letters, written, by, agassiz, gould, compares, agassiz, public, display, of, dispassionate, objectivity, to, his, private, correspondence, in, which, he, describes, the, production, of, half, breeds, as, a, sin, against, nature, describing, the, interbreeding, of, white, and, black, people, he, warns, we, have, already, had, to, struggle, in, our, progress, against, the, influence, of, universal, equality, but, how, shall, we, eradicate, the, stigma, of, a, lower, race, when, its, blood, has, once, been, allowed, to, flow, freely, into, our, children, in, contrast, others, have, asserted, that, despite, favoring, polygenism, agassiz, rejected, racism, and, believed, in, a, spiritualized, human, unity, however, in, the, same, article, agassiz, asks, the, reader, to, consider, the, hierarchy, of, races, mentioning, the, indomitable, courageous, proud, indian, in, how, very, different, a, light, he, stands, by, the, side, of, the, submissive, obsequious, imitative, negro, or, by, the, side, of, the, tricky, cunning, and, cowardly, mongolian, are, not, these, facts, indications, that, the, different, races, do, not, rank, upon, one, level, in, nature, agassiz, never, supported, slavery, and, claimed, his, views, on, polygenism, had, nothing, to, do, with, politics, his, views, on, polygenism, have, been, claimed, to, have, emboldened, proponents, of, slavery, accusations, of, racism, against, agassiz, have, prompted, the, renaming, of, landmarks, schoolhouses, and, other, institutions, which, abound, in, massachusetts, that, bear, his, name, opinions, about, those, moves, are, often, mixed, given, his, extensive, scientific, legacy, in, other, areas, and, uncertainty, about, his, actual, racial, beliefs, in, 2007, the, swiss, government, acknowledged, his, racist, thinking, but, declined, to, rename, the, agassizhorn, summit, in, 2017, the, swiss, alpine, club, declined, to, revoke, agassiz, s, status, as, a, member, of, honor, which, he, received, in, 1865, for, his, scientific, work, because, the, club, considered, that, status, to, have, lapsed, on, agassiz, s, death, in, 2020, the, stanford, department, of, psychology, asked, for, a, statue, of, louis, agassiz, to, be, removed, from, the, front, fa, ade, of, its, building, in, 2021, chicago, public, schools, announced, they, would, remove, agassiz, s, name, from, an, elementary, school, and, rename, it, for, the, abolitionist, and, political, activist, harriet, tubman, in, 2022, the, trustees, of, reservations, renamed, agassiz, rock, as, the, monoliths, attribution, a, collection, of, louis, agassiz, s, professional, and, personal, life, is, conserved, in, the, state, archives, of, neuch, tel
