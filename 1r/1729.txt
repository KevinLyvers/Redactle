paracelsus, p, r, s, l, s, s, german, c, 1493, 24, september, 1541, born, theophrastus, von, hohenheim, full, name, philippus, aureolus, theophrastus, bombastus, von, hohenheim, was, a, swiss, physician, alchemist, lay, theologian, and, philosopher, of, the, german, renaissance, he, was, a, pioneer, in, several, aspects, of, the, medical, revolution, of, the, renaissance, emphasizing, the, value, of, observation, in, combination, with, received, wisdom, he, is, credited, as, the, father, of, toxicology, paracelsus, also, had, a, substantial, influence, as, a, prophet, or, diviner, his, prognostications, being, studied, by, rosicrucians, in, the, 17th, century, paracelsianism, is, the, early, modern, medical, movement, inspired, by, the, study, of, his, works, paracelsus, was, born, in, egg, an, der, sihl, a, village, close, to, the, etzel, pass, in, einsiedeln, schwyz, he, was, born, in, a, house, next, to, a, bridge, across, the, sihl, river, his, father, wilhelm, d, 1534, was, a, chemist, and, physician, an, illegitimate, descendant, of, the, swabian, noble, georg, bombast, von, hohenheim, 1453, 1499, commander, of, the, order, of, saint, john, in, rohrdorf, paracelsus, mother, was, probably, a, native, of, the, einsiedeln, region, and, a, bondswoman, of, einsiedeln, abbey, who, before, her, marriage, worked, as, superintendent, in, the, abbey, s, hospital, paracelsus, in, his, writings, repeatedly, made, references, to, his, rustic, origins, and, occasionally, used, eremita, from, the, name, of, einsiedeln, meaning, hermitage, as, part, of, his, name, paracelsus, mother, probably, died, in, 1502, after, which, paracelsus, s, father, moved, to, villach, carinthia, where, he, worked, as, a, physician, attending, to, the, medical, needs, of, the, pilgrims, and, inhabitants, of, the, cloister, paracelsus, was, educated, by, his, father, in, botany, medicine, mineralogy, mining, and, natural, philosophy, he, received, a, profound, humanistic, and, theological, education, from, local, clerics, and, the, convent, school, of, st, paul, s, abbey, in, the, lavanttal, it, is, likely, that, paracelsus, received, his, early, education, mainly, from, his, father, some, biographers, have, claimed, that, he, received, tutoring, from, four, bishops, and, johannes, trithemius, abbot, of, sponheim, however, there, is, no, record, of, trithemius, spending, much, time, at, einsiedeln, nor, of, paracelsus, visiting, sponheim, or, w, rzburg, before, trithemius, s, death, in, 1516, all, things, considered, paracelsus, almost, certainly, received, instructions, from, their, writings, and, not, from, direct, teaching, in, person, at, the, age, of, 16, he, started, studying, medicine, at, the, university, of, basel, later, moving, to, vienna, he, gained, his, medical, doctorate, from, the, university, of, ferrara, in, 1515, or, 1516, paracelsus, sought, a, universal, knowledge, that, was, not, found, in, books, or, faculties, thus, between, 1517, and, 1524, he, embarked, on, a, series, of, extensive, travels, around, europe, his, wanderings, led, him, from, italy, to, france, spain, portugal, england, germany, scandinavia, poland, russia, hungary, croatia, rhodes, constantinople, and, possibly, even, egypt, during, this, period, of, travel, paracelsus, enlisted, as, an, army, surgeon, and, was, involved, in, the, wars, waged, by, venice, holland, denmark, and, the, tatars, then, paracelsus, returned, home, from, his, travels, in, 1524, in, 1524, fter, visiting, his, father, at, villach, and, finding, no, local, opportunity, to, practice, he, settled, in, salzburg, as, a, physician, and, remained, there, until, 1527, since, 1519, 20, he, had, been, working, on, his, first, medical, writings, and, he, now, completed, elf, traktat, and, volumen, medicinae, paramirum, which, describe, eleven, common, maladies, and, their, treatment, and, his, early, medical, principles, while, he, was, returning, to, villach, and, while, he, worked, on, his, first, medical, writings, he, contemplated, many, fundamental, issues, such, as, the, meaning, of, life, and, death, health, the, causes, of, disease, internal, imbalances, or, external, forces, the, place, of, humans, in, the, world, and, in, the, universe, and, the, relationship, between, humans, including, himself, and, god, in, 1526, he, bought, the, rights, of, citizenship, in, strasbourg, to, establish, his, own, practice, but, soon, after, he, was, called, to, basel, to, the, sickbed, of, printer, johann, frobenius, and, reportedly, cured, him, during, that, time, the, dutch, renaissance, humanist, erasmus, of, rotterdam, also, at, the, university, of, basel, witnessed, the, medical, skills, of, paracelsus, and, the, two, scholars, initiated, a, dialogue, exchanging, letters, on, medical, and, theological, subjects, in, 1527, paracelsus, was, a, licensed, physician, in, basel, with, the, privilege, of, lecturing, at, the, university, of, basel, at, that, time, basel, was, a, centre, of, renaissance, humanism, and, paracelsus, here, came, into, contact, with, erasmus, of, rotterdam, wolfgang, lachner, and, johannes, oekolampad, when, erasmus, fell, ill, while, staying, in, basel, he, wrote, to, paracelsus, i, cannot, offer, thee, a, reward, equal, to, thy, art, and, knowledge, i, surely, offer, thee, a, grateful, soul, thou, hast, recalled, from, the, shades, frobenius, who, is, my, other, half, if, thou, restorest, me, also, thou, restorest, each, through, the, other, paracelsus, lectures, at, basel, university, unusually, were, given, in, german, not, latin, he, stated, that, he, wanted, his, lectures, to, be, available, to, everyone, he, published, harsh, criticism, of, the, basel, physicians, and, apothecaries, creating, political, turmoil, to, the, point, of, his, life, being, threatened, in, a, display, of, his, contempt, for, conventional, medicine, paracelsus, publicly, burned, editions, of, the, works, of, galen, and, avicenna, on, 23, june, 1527, he, burnt, a, copy, of, avicenna, s, canon, of, medicine, an, enormous, tome, that, was, a, pillar, of, academic, study, in, market, square, he, was, prone, to, many, outbursts, of, abusive, language, abhorred, untested, theory, and, ridiculed, anybody, who, placed, more, importance, on, titles, than, practice, if, disease, put, us, to, the, test, all, our, splendour, title, ring, and, name, will, be, as, much, help, as, a, horse, s, tail, during, his, time, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, basel, he, invited, barber, surgeons, alchemists, apothecaries, and, others, lacking, academic, background, to, serve, as, examples, of, his, belief, that, only, those, who, practised, an, art, knew, it, the, patients, are, your, textbook, the, sickbed, is, your, study, paracelsus, was, compared, with, martin, luther, because, of, his, openly, defiant, acts, against, the, existing, authorities, in, medicine, but, paracelsus, rejected, that, comparison, famously, stating, i, leave, it, to, luther, to, defend, what, he, says, and, i, will, be, responsible, for, what, i, say, that, which, you, wish, to, luther, you, wish, also, to, me, you, wish, us, both, in, the, fire, a, companion, during, the, basel, years, expressed, a, quite, unflattering, opinion, on, paracelsus, the, two, years, i, passed, in, his, company, he, spent, in, drinking, and, gluttony, day, and, night, he, could, not, be, found, sober, an, hour, or, two, together, in, particular, after, his, departure, from, basel, threatened, with, an, unwinnable, lawsuit, he, left, basel, for, alsace, in, february, 1528, in, alsace, paracelsus, took, up, the, life, of, an, itinerant, physician, once, again, after, staying, in, colmar, with, lorenz, fries, and, briefly, in, esslingen, he, moved, to, nuremberg, in, 1529, his, reputation, went, before, him, and, the, medical, professionals, excluded, him, from, practising, the, name, paracelsus, is, first, attested, in, this, year, used, as, a, pseudonym, for, the, publication, of, a, practica, of, political, astrological, character, in, nuremberg, pagel, 1982, supposes, that, the, name, was, intended, for, use, as, the, author, of, non, medical, works, while, his, real, name, theophrastus, von, hohenheim, was, used, for, medical, publications, the, first, use, of, doctor, paracelsus, in, a, medical, publication, was, in, 1536, as, the, author, of, the, grosse, wundartznei, the, name, is, usually, interpreted, as, either, a, latinization, of, hohenheim, based, on, celsus, high, tall, or, as, the, claim, of, surpassing, celsus, it, has, been, argued, that, the, name, was, not, the, invention, of, paracelsus, himself, who, would, have, been, opposed, to, the, humanistic, fashion, of, latinized, names, but, was, given, to, him, by, his, circle, of, friends, in, colmar, in, 1528, it, is, difficult, to, interpret, but, does, appear, to, express, the, paradoxical, character, of, the, man, the, prefix, para, suggestively, being, echoed, in, the, titles, of, paracelsus, s, main, philosophical, works, paragranum, and, paramirum, as, it, were, beyond, the, grain, and, beyond, wonder, a, paramiric, treatise, having, been, announced, by, paracelsus, as, early, as, 1520, the, great, medical, problem, of, this, period, was, syphilis, possibly, recently, imported, from, the, west, indies, and, running, rampant, as, a, pandemic, completely, untreated, paracelsus, vigorously, attacked, the, treatment, with, guaiac, wood, as, useless, a, scam, perpetrated, by, the, fugger, of, augsburg, as, the, main, importers, of, the, wood, in, two, publications, on, the, topic, when, his, further, stay, in, nuremberg, had, become, impossible, he, retired, to, beratzhausen, hoping, to, return, to, nuremberg, and, publish, an, extended, treatise, on, the, french, sickness, but, its, publication, was, prohibited, by, a, decree, of, the, leipzig, faculty, of, medicine, represented, by, heinrich, stromer, a, close, friend, and, associate, of, the, fugger, family, in, beratzhausen, paracelsus, prepared, paragranum, his, main, work, on, medical, philosophy, completed, 1530, moving, on, to, st, gall, he, then, completed, his, opus, paramirum, in, 1531, which, he, dedicated, to, joachim, vadian, from, st, gall, he, moved, on, to, the, land, of, appenzell, where, he, was, active, as, lay, preacher, and, healer, among, the, peasantry, in, the, same, year, he, visited, the, mines, in, schwaz, and, hall, in, tyrol, working, on, his, book, on, miners, diseases, he, moved, on, to, innsbruck, where, he, was, once, again, barred, from, practising, he, passed, sterzing, in, 1534, moving, on, to, meran, veltlin, and, st, moritz, which, he, praised, for, its, healing, springs, in, meran, he, came, in, contact, with, the, socioreligious, programs, of, the, anabaptists, he, visited, pf, fers, abbey, dedicating, a, separate, pamphlet, to, its, baths, 1535, he, passed, kempten, memmingen, ulm, and, augsburg, in, 1536, he, finally, managed, to, publish, his, die, grosse, wundartznei, the, great, surgery, book, printed, in, ulm, augsburg, and, frankfurt, in, this, year, his, astronomia, magna, also, known, as, philosophia, sagax, was, completed, in, 1537, but, not, published, until, 1571, it, is, a, treatise, on, hermeticism, astrology, divination, theology, and, demonology, that, laid, the, basis, of, paracelsus, s, later, fame, as, a, prophet, his, motto, alterius, non, sit, qui, suus, esse, potest, let, no, man, belong, to, another, who, can, belong, to, himself, is, inscribed, on, a, 1538, portrait, by, augustin, hirschvogel, in, 1541, paracelsus, moved, to, salzburg, where, he, died, on, 24, september, he, was, buried, in, st, sebastian, s, cemetery, in, salzburg, his, remains, were, relocated, inside, st, sebastian, s, church, in, 1752, after, his, death, the, movement, of, paracelsianism, was, seized, upon, by, many, wishing, to, subvert, the, traditional, galenic, physics, and, his, therapies, became, more, widely, known, and, used, his, manuscripts, have, been, lost, but, many, of, his, works, which, remained, unpublished, during, his, lifetime, were, edited, by, johannes, huser, of, basel, during, 1589, to, 1591, his, works, were, frequently, reprinted, and, widely, read, during, the, late, 16th, to, early, 17th, centuries, and, although, his, occult, reputation, remained, controversial, his, medical, contributions, were, universally, recognized, a, 1618, pharmacopeia, by, the, royal, college, of, physicians, in, london, included, paracelsian, remedies, the, late, 16th, century, saw, substantial, production, of, pseudo, paracelsian, writing, especially, letters, attributed, to, paracelsus, to, the, point, where, biographers, find, it, impossible, to, draw, a, clear, line, between, genuine, tradition, and, legend, as, a, physician, of, the, early, 16th, century, paracelsus, held, a, natural, affinity, with, the, hermetic, neoplatonic, and, pythagorean, philosophies, central, to, the, renaissance, a, world, view, exemplified, by, marsilio, ficino, and, pico, della, mirandola, astrology, was, a, very, important, part, of, paracelsus, s, medicine, and, he, was, a, practising, astrologer, as, were, many, of, the, university, trained, physicians, working, at, that, time, in, europe, paracelsus, devoted, several, sections, in, his, writings, to, the, construction, of, astrological, talismans, for, curing, disease, paracelsus, s, approach, to, science, was, heavily, influenced, by, his, religious, beliefs, he, believed, that, science, and, religion, were, inseparable, and, scientific, discoveries, were, direct, messages, from, god, thus, he, believed, it, was, mankind, s, divine, duty, to, uncover, and, understand, all, of, his, message, paracelsus, also, believed, that, the, virtues, that, make, up, natural, objects, are, not, natural, but, supernatural, and, existed, in, god, before, the, creation, of, the, universe, because, of, this, when, the, earth, and, the, heavens, eventually, dissipate, the, virtues, of, all, natural, objects, will, continue, to, exist, and, simply, return, to, god, his, philosophy, about, the, true, nature, of, the, virtues, is, reminiscent, of, aristotle, s, idea, of, the, natural, place, of, elements, to, paracelsus, the, purpose, of, science, is, not, only, to, learn, more, about, the, world, around, us, but, also, to, search, for, divine, signs, and, potentially, understand, the, nature, of, god, if, a, person, who, doesn, t, believe, in, god, became, a, physician, he, would, not, have, standing, in, god, s, eyes, and, would, not, succeed, in, their, work, because, he, did, not, practice, in, his, name, becoming, an, effective, physician, requires, faith, in, god, paracelsus, saw, medicine, as, more, than, just, a, perfunctory, practice, to, him, medicine, was, a, divine, mission, and, good, character, combined, with, devotion, to, god, was, more, important, than, personal, skill, he, encouraged, physicians, to, practice, self, improvement, and, humility, along, with, studying, philosophy, to, gain, new, experiences, paracelsus, was, one, of, the, first, medical, professors, to, recognize, that, physicians, required, a, solid, academic, knowledge, in, the, natural, sciences, especially, chemistry, paracelsus, pioneered, the, use, of, chemicals, and, minerals, in, medicine, he, was, probably, the, first, to, give, the, element, zinc, zincum, its, modern, name, in, about, 1526, likely, based, on, the, sharp, pointed, appearance, of, its, crystals, after, smelting, zinke, translating, to, pointed, in, german, paracelsus, invented, chemical, therapy, chemical, urinalysis, and, suggested, a, biochemical, theory, of, digestion, paracelsus, used, chemistry, and, chemical, analogies, in, his, teachings, to, medical, students, and, to, the, medical, establishment, many, of, whom, found, them, objectionable, paracelsus, in, the, beginning, of, the, sixteenth, century, had, unknowingly, observed, hydrogen, as, he, noted, that, in, reaction, when, acids, attack, metals, gas, was, a, by, product, later, th, odore, de, mayerne, repeated, paracelsus, s, experiment, in, 1650, and, found, that, the, gas, was, flammable, however, neither, paracelsus, nor, de, mayerne, proposed, that, hydrogen, could, be, a, new, element, paracelsus, largely, rejected, the, philosophies, of, aristotle, and, galen, as, well, as, the, theory, of, humours, although, he, did, accept, the, concept, of, the, four, elements, water, air, fire, and, earth, he, saw, them, as, a, foundation, for, other, properties, on, which, to, build, in, a, posthumously, published, book, entitled, a, book, on, nymphs, sylphs, pygmies, and, salamanders, and, on, the, other, spirits, paracelsus, also, described, four, elemental, beings, each, corresponding, to, one, of, the, four, elements, salamanders, which, correspond, to, fire, gnomes, corresponding, to, earth, undines, corresponding, to, water, and, sylphs, corresponding, to, air, paracelsus, often, viewed, fire, as, the, firmament, that, sat, between, air, and, water, in, the, heavens, paracelsus, often, uses, an, egg, to, help, describe, the, elements, in, his, early, model, he, claimed, that, air, surrounded, the, world, like, an, egg, shell, the, egg, white, below, the, shell, is, like, fire, because, it, has, a, type, of, chaos, to, it, that, allows, it, to, hold, up, earth, and, water, the, earth, and, water, make, up, a, globe, which, in, his, egg, analogy, is, the, yolk, in, de, meteoris, paracelsus, claims, the, firmament, is, the, heavens, from, his, study, of, the, elements, paracelsus, adopted, the, idea, of, tripartite, alternatives, to, explain, the, nature, of, medicines, which, he, thought, to, be, composed, of, the, tria, prima, three, primes, or, principles, a, combustible, element, sulphur, a, fluid, and, changeable, element, mercury, and, a, solid, permanent, element, salt, the, first, mention, of, the, mercury, sulphur, salt, model, was, in, the, opus, paramirum, dating, to, about, 1530, paracelsus, believed, that, the, principles, sulphur, mercury, and, salt, contained, the, poisons, contributing, to, all, diseases, he, saw, each, disease, as, having, three, separate, cures, depending, on, how, it, was, afflicted, either, being, caused, by, the, poisoning, of, sulphur, mercury, or, salt, paracelsus, drew, the, importance, of, sulphur, salt, and, mercury, from, medieval, alchemy, where, they, all, occupied, a, prominent, place, he, demonstrated, his, theory, by, burning, a, piece, of, wood, the, fire, was, the, work, of, sulphur, the, smoke, was, mercury, and, the, residual, ash, was, salt, paracelsus, also, believed, that, mercury, sulphur, and, salt, provided, a, good, explanation, for, the, nature, of, medicine, because, each, of, these, properties, existed, in, many, physical, forms, the, tria, prima, also, defined, the, human, identity, salt, represented, the, body, mercury, represented, the, spirit, imagination, moral, judgment, and, the, higher, mental, faculties, sulphur, represented, the, soul, the, emotions, and, desires, by, understanding, the, chemical, nature, of, the, tria, prima, a, physician, could, discover, the, means, of, curing, disease, with, every, disease, the, symptoms, depended, on, which, of, the, three, principals, caused, the, ailment, paracelsus, theorized, that, materials, which, are, poisonous, in, large, doses, may, be, curative, in, small, doses, he, demonstrated, this, with, the, examples, of, magnetism, and, static, electricity, wherein, a, small, magnet, can, attract, much, larger, pieces, of, metal, even, though, paracelsus, accepted, the, four, classical, elements, in, robert, boyle, s, the, sceptical, chymist, published, in, 1661, in, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, friends, themistius, the, aristotelian, of, the, party, speaks, of, the, three, principles, as, though, they, were, meant, to, replace, rather, than, complement, the, classical, elements, and, compares, paracelsus, theory, of, the, elements, unfavourably, with, that, of, aristotle, this, doctrine, is, very, different, from, the, whimseys, of, chymists, whose, hypotheses, often, fram, d, in, one, week, are, perhaps, thought, fit, to, be, laughed, at, the, next, and, being, built, perchance, but, upon, two, or, three, experiments, are, destroyed, by, a, third, or, fourth, whereas, the, doctrine, of, the, four, elements, was, fram, d, by, aristotle, after, he, had, considered, those, theories, of, former, philosophers, which, are, now, with, great, applause, revived, and, had, so, judiciously, detected, the, defects, of, former, hypotheses, concerning, the, elements, that, his, doctrine, has, been, ever, since, deservedly, embraced, by, the, letter, d, part, of, mankind, all, the, philosophers, that, preceded, him, having, in, their, several, ages, contributed, to, the, compleatness, of, this, doctrine, nor, has, an, hypothesis, so, maturely, established, been, called, in, question, till, in, the, last, century, paracelsus, and, some, empiricks, rather, then, philosophers, began, to, rail, at, the, peripatetick, doctrine, and, to, tell, the, credulous, world, that, they, could, see, but, three, ingredients, in, mixt, bodies, instead, of, earth, and, fire, and, vapour, salt, sulphur, and, mercury, to, which, they, gave, the, canting, title, of, hypostatical, principles, but, when, they, came, to, describe, them, tis, almost, impossible, for, any, sober, man, to, find, their, meaning, boyle, speaking, through, other, characters, rejected, both, paracelsus, three, principles, sulfur, mercury, and, salt, and, the, aristotelian, elements, earth, water, air, and, fire, or, any, system, with, a, pre, determined, number, of, elements, in, fact, boyle, s, arguments, were, mainly, directed, against, paracelsus, theory, as, being, the, one, more, in, line, with, experience, so, that, arguments, against, it, should, be, at, least, as, valid, against, the, aristotelian, view, much, of, what, i, am, to, deliver, may, be, indifferently, apply, d, to, the, four, peripatetick, elements, and, the, three, chymical, principles, the, chymical, hypothesis, seeming, to, be, much, more, countenanc, d, by, experience, then, the, other, it, will, be, expedient, to, insist, chiefly, upon, the, disproving, of, that, especially, since, most, of, the, arguments, that, are, imploy, d, against, it, may, by, a, little, variation, be, made, at, least, as, strongly, against, the, less, plausible, aristotelian, doctrine, his, hermetic, beliefs, were, that, sickness, and, health, in, the, body, relied, upon, the, harmony, of, humans, microcosm, and, nature, macrocosm, he, took, a, different, approach, from, those, before, him, using, this, analogy, not, in, the, manner, of, soul, purification, but, in, the, manner, that, humans, must, have, certain, balances, of, minerals, in, their, bodies, and, that, certain, illnesses, of, the, body, had, chemical, remedies, that, could, cure, them, as, a, result, of, this, hermetical, idea, of, harmony, the, universe, s, macrocosm, was, represented, in, every, person, as, a, microcosm, an, example, of, this, correspondence, is, the, doctrine, of, signatures, used, to, identify, curative, powers, of, plants, if, a, plant, looked, like, a, part, of, the, body, then, this, signified, its, ability, to, cure, this, given, anatomy, therefore, the, root, of, the, orchid, looks, like, a, testicle, and, can, therefore, heal, any, testicle, associated, illness, paracelsus, mobilized, the, microcosm, macrocosm, theory, to, demonstrate, the, analogy, between, the, aspirations, to, salvation, and, health, as, humans, must, ward, off, the, influence, of, evil, spirits, with, morality, they, must, also, ward, off, diseases, with, good, health, paracelsus, believed, that, true, anatomy, could, only, be, understood, once, the, nourishment, for, each, part, of, the, body, was, discovered, he, believed, that, one, must, therefore, know, the, influence, of, the, stars, on, these, particular, body, parts, diseases, were, caused, by, poisons, brought, from, the, stars, however, poisons, were, not, necessarily, something, negative, in, part, because, related, substances, interacted, but, also, because, only, the, dose, determined, if, a, substance, was, poisonous, paracelsus, claimed, in, contrast, to, galen, that, like, cures, like, if, a, star, or, poison, caused, a, disease, then, it, must, be, countered, by, another, star, or, poison, because, everything, in, the, universe, was, interrelated, beneficial, medical, substances, could, be, found, in, herbs, minerals, and, various, chemical, combinations, thereof, paracelsus, viewed, the, universe, as, one, coherent, organism, that, is, pervaded, by, a, uniting, life, giving, spirit, and, this, in, its, entirety, humans, included, was, god, his, beliefs, put, him, at, odds, with, the, catholic, church, for, which, there, necessarily, had, to, be, a, difference, between, the, creator, and, the, created, therefore, some, have, considered, him, to, be, a, protestant, paracelsus, is, frequently, credited, with, reintroducing, opium, to, western, europe, during, the, german, renaissance, he, extolled, the, benefits, of, opium, and, of, a, pill, he, called, laudanum, which, has, frequently, been, asserted, by, others, to, have, been, an, opium, tincture, paracelsus, did, not, leave, a, complete, recipe, and, the, known, ingredients, differ, considerably, from, 17th, century, laudanum, paracelsus, invented, or, at, least, named, a, sort, of, liniment, opodeldoc, a, mixture, of, soap, in, alcohol, to, which, camphor, and, sometimes, a, number, of, herbal, essences, most, notably, wormwood, were, added, paracelsus, s, recipe, forms, the, basis, for, most, later, versions, of, liniment, his, work, die, gro, e, wundarzney, is, a, forerunner, of, antisepsis, this, specific, empirical, knowledge, originated, from, his, personal, experiences, as, an, army, physician, in, the, venetian, wars, paracelsus, demanded, that, the, application, of, cow, dung, feathers, and, other, noxious, concoctions, to, wounds, be, surrendered, in, favour, of, keeping, the, wounds, clean, stating, if, you, prevent, infection, nature, will, heal, the, wound, all, by, herself, during, his, time, as, a, military, surgeon, paracelsus, was, exposed, to, the, crudity, of, medical, knowledge, at, the, time, when, doctors, believed, that, infection, was, a, natural, part, of, the, healing, process, he, advocated, for, cleanliness, and, protection, of, wounds, as, well, as, the, regulation, of, diet, popular, ideas, of, the, time, opposed, these, theories, and, suggested, sewing, or, plastering, wounds, historians, of, syphilitic, disease, credit, paracelsus, with, the, recognition, of, the, inherited, character, of, syphilis, in, his, first, medical, publication, a, short, pamphlet, on, syphilis, treatment, that, was, also, the, most, comprehensive, clinical, description, the, period, ever, produced, he, wrote, a, clinical, description, of, syphilis, in, which, he, maintained, that, it, could, be, treated, by, carefully, measured, doses, of, mercury, similarly, he, was, the, first, to, discover, that, the, disease, could, only, be, contracted, by, contact, hippocrates, put, forward, the, theory, that, illness, was, caused, by, an, imbalance, of, the, four, humours, blood, phlegm, black, bile, and, yellow, bile, these, ideas, were, further, developed, by, galen, into, an, extremely, influential, and, highly, persistent, set, of, medical, beliefs, that, were, to, last, until, the, mid, 1850s, contrarily, paracelsus, believed, in, three, humours, salt, representing, stability, sulphur, representing, combustibility, and, mercury, representing, liquidity, he, defined, disease, as, a, separation, of, one, humour, from, the, other, two, he, believed, that, body, organs, functioned, alchemically, that, is, they, separated, pure, from, impure, the, dominant, medical, treatments, in, paracelsus, s, time, were, specific, diets, to, help, in, the, cleansing, of, the, putrefied, juices, combined, with, purging, and, bloodletting, to, restore, the, balance, of, the, four, humours, paracelsus, supplemented, and, challenged, this, view, with, his, beliefs, that, illness, was, the, result, of, the, body, being, attacked, by, outside, agents, he, objected, to, excessive, bloodletting, saying, that, the, process, disturbed, the, harmony, of, the, system, and, that, blood, could, not, be, purified, by, lessening, its, quantity, paracelsus, believed, that, fasting, helped, enable, the, body, to, heal, itself, fasting, is, the, greatest, remedy, the, physician, within, paracelsus, gave, birth, to, clinical, diagnosis, and, the, administration, of, highly, specific, medicines, this, was, uncommon, for, a, period, heavily, exposed, to, cure, all, remedies, the, germ, theory, was, anticipated, by, him, as, he, proposed, that, diseases, were, entities, in, themselves, rather, than, states, of, being, paracelsus, prescribed, black, hellebore, to, alleviate, certain, forms, of, arteriosclerosis, lastly, he, recommended, the, use, of, iron, for, poor, blood, and, is, credited, with, the, creation, of, the, terms, chemistry, gas, and, alcohol, during, paracelsus, s, lifetime, and, after, his, death, he, was, often, celebrated, as, a, wonder, healer, and, investigator, of, those, folk, medicines, that, were, rejected, by, the, fathers, of, medicine, e, g, galen, avicenna, it, was, believed, that, he, had, success, with, his, own, remedies, curing, the, plague, according, to, those, that, revered, him, since, effective, medicines, for, serious, infectious, diseases, weren, t, invented, before, the, 19th, century, paracelsus, came, up, with, many, prescriptions, and, concoctions, on, his, own, for, infectious, diseases, with, fever, it, was, common, to, prescribe, diaphoretics, and, tonics, that, at, least, gave, temporary, relief, also, many, of, his, remedies, contained, the, famed, theriac, a, preparation, derived, from, oriental, medicine, sometimes, containing, opium, the, following, prescription, by, paracelsus, was, dedicated, to, the, village, of, sterzing, also, sol, das, trank, gemacht, werden, dadurch, die,

minerals, and, the, curative, powers, of, alpine, mineral, springs, his, countless, wanderings, also, brought, him, deep, into, many, areas, of, the, alps, where, such, therapies, were, already, practised, on, a, less, common, scale, than, today, paracelsus, s, major, work, on, the, miners, sickness, and, other, diseases, of, miners, german, von, der, bergaucht, und, anderen, bergkrankheiten, presented, his, observation, of, diseases, of, miners, and, the, effects, of, various, minerals, and, metals, in, the, human, organism, paracelsus, extended, his, interest, in, chemistry, and, biology, to, what, is, now, considered, toxicology, he, clearly, expounded, the, concept, of, dose, response, in, his, third, defence, where, he, stated, that, solely, the, dose, determines, that, a, thing, is, not, a, poison, sola, dosis, facit, venenum, only, the, dose, makes, the, poison, this, was, used, to, defend, his, use, of, inorganic, substances, in, medicine, as, outsiders, frequently, criticized, paracelsus, s, chemical, agents, as, too, toxic, to, be, used, as, therapeutic, agents, his, belief, that, diseases, locate, in, a, specific, organ, was, extended, to, inclusion, of, target, organ, toxicity, that, is, there, is, a, specific, site, in, the, body, where, a, chemical, will, exert, its, greatest, effect, paracelsus, also, encouraged, using, experimental, animals, to, study, both, beneficial, and, toxic, chemical, effects, paracelsus, was, one, of, the, first, european, scientists, to, introduce, chemistry, to, medicine, he, advocated, the, use, of, inorganic, salts, minerals, and, metals, for, medicinal, purposes, he, held, the, belief, that, organs, in, the, body, operated, on, the, basis, of, separating, pure, substances, from, impure, ones, humans, must, eat, to, survive, and, they, eat, both, pure, and, impure, things, it, is, the, function, of, organs, to, separate, the, impure, from, the, pure, the, pure, substances, will, be, absorbed, by, the, body, while, the, impure, will, exit, the, body, as, excrement, he, did, not, support, hippocrate, s, theory, of, the, four, humours, instead, of, four, humours, paracelsus, believed, there, were, three, salt, sulphur, and, mercury, which, represent, stability, combustibility, and, liquidity, respectively, separation, of, any, one, of, these, humours, from, the, other, two, would, result, in, disease, to, cure, a, disease, of, a, certain, intensity, a, substance, of, similar, nature, but, the, opposite, intensity, should, be, administered, these, ideas, constitute, paracelsus, s, principles, of, similitude, and, contrariety, respectively, in, his, work, von, den, krankeiten, paracelsus, writes, thus, the, cause, of, the, disease, chorea, lasciva, is, a, mere, opinion, and, idea, assumed, by, imagination, affecting, those, who, believe, in, such, a, thing, this, opinion, and, idea, are, the, origin, of, the, disease, both, in, children, and, adults, in, children, the, case, is, also, imagination, based, not, on, thinking, but, on, perceiving, because, they, have, heard, or, seen, something, the, reason, is, this, their, sight, and, hearing, are, so, strong, that, unconsciously, they, have, fantasies, about, what, they, have, seen, or, heard, paracelsus, called, for, the, humane, treatment, of, the, mentally, ill, as, he, saw, them, not, to, be, possessed, by, evil, spirits, but, merely, brothers, ensnared, in, a, treatable, malady, paracelsus, is, one, of, the, first, physicians, to, suggest, that, mental, well, being, and, a, moral, conscience, had, a, direct, effect, on, physical, health, he, proposed, that, the, state, of, a, person, s, psyche, could, cure, and, cause, disease, theoretically, a, person, could, maintain, good, health, through, sheer, will, he, also, stated, that, whether, or, not, a, person, could, succeed, in, their, craft, depended, on, their, character, for, example, if, a, physician, had, shrewd, and, immoral, intentions, then, they, would, eventually, fail, in, their, career, because, evil, could, not, lead, to, success, when, it, came, to, mental, illness, paracelsus, stressed, the, importance, of, sleep, and, sedation, as, he, believed, sedation, with, sulphur, preparations, could, catalyse, healing, and, cure, mental, illness, the, oldest, surviving, portrait, of, paracelsus, is, a, woodcut, by,
