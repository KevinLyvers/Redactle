lucian, of, samosata, c, 125, after, 180, was, a, hellenized, syrian, satirist, rhetorician, and, pamphleteer, who, is, best, known, for, his, characteristic, tongue, in, cheek, style, with, which, he, frequently, ridiculed, superstition, religious, practices, and, belief, in, the, paranormal, although, his, native, language, was, probably, syriac, all, of, his, extant, works, are, written, entirely, in, ancient, greek, mostly, in, the, attic, greek, dialect, popular, during, the, second, sophistic, period, everything, that, is, known, about, lucian, s, life, comes, from, his, own, writings, which, are, often, difficult, to, interpret, because, of, his, extensive, use, of, sarcasm, according, to, his, oration, the, dream, he, was, the, son, of, a, lower, middle, class, family, from, the, city, of, samosata, along, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, in, the, remote, roman, province, of, syria, as, a, young, man, he, was, apprenticed, to, his, uncle, to, become, a, sculptor, but, after, a, failed, attempt, at, sculpting, he, ran, away, to, pursue, an, education, in, ionia, he, may, have, become, a, travelling, lecturer, and, visited, universities, throughout, the, roman, empire, after, acquiring, fame, and, wealth, through, his, teaching, lucian, finally, settled, down, in, athens, for, a, decade, during, which, he, wrote, most, of, his, extant, works, in, his, fifties, he, may, have, been, appointed, as, a, highly, paid, government, official, in, egypt, after, which, point, he, disappears, from, the, historical, record, lucian, s, works, were, wildly, popular, in, antiquity, and, more, than, eighty, writings, attributed, to, him, have, survived, to, the, present, day, a, considerably, higher, quantity, than, for, most, other, classical, writers, his, most, famous, work, is, a, true, story, a, tongue, in, cheek, satire, against, authors, who, tell, incredible, tales, which, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, earliest, known, work, of, science, fiction, lucian, invented, the, genre, of, comic, dialogue, a, parody, of, the, traditional, socratic, dialogue, his, dialogue, lover, of, lies, makes, fun, of, people, who, believe, in, the, supernatural, and, contains, the, oldest, known, version, of, the, sorcerer, s, apprentice, lucian, wrote, numerous, satires, making, fun, of, traditional, stories, about, the, gods, including, the, dialogues, of, the, gods, icaromenippus, zeus, rants, zeus, catechized, and, the, parliament, of, the, gods, his, dialogues, of, the, dead, focuses, on, the, cynic, philosophers, diogenes, and, menippus, philosophies, for, sale, and, the, carousal, or, the, lapiths, make, fun, of, various, philosophical, schools, and, the, fisherman, or, the, dead, come, to, life, is, a, defense, of, this, mockery, lucian, often, ridiculed, public, figures, such, as, the, cynic, philosopher, peregrinus, proteus, in, his, letter, the, passing, of, peregrinus, and, the, fraudulent, oracle, alexander, of, abonoteichus, in, his, treatise, alexander, the, false, prophet, lucian, s, treatise, on, the, syrian, goddess, satirizes, cultural, distinctions, between, greeks, and, syrians, and, is, the, main, source, of, information, about, the, cult, of, atargatis, lucian, had, an, enormous, wide, ranging, impact, on, western, literature, works, inspired, by, his, writings, include, thomas, more, s, utopia, the, works, of, fran, ois, rabelais, william, shakespeare, s, timon, of, athens, and, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, lucian, is, not, mentioned, in, any, contemporary, texts, or, inscriptions, written, by, others, and, he, is, not, included, in, philostratus, s, lives, of, the, sophists, as, a, result, of, this, everything, that, is, known, about, lucian, comes, exclusively, from, his, own, writings, a, variety, of, characters, with, names, very, similar, to, lucian, including, lukinos, lukianos, lucius, and, the, syrian, appear, throughout, lucian, s, writings, these, have, been, frequently, interpreted, by, scholars, and, biographers, as, masks, alter, egos, or, mouthpieces, of, the, author, daniel, s, richter, criticizes, the, frequent, tendency, to, interpret, such, lucian, like, figures, as, self, inserts, by, the, author, and, argues, that, they, are, in, fact, merely, fictional, characters, lucian, uses, to, think, with, when, satirizing, conventional, distinctions, between, greeks, and, syrians, he, suggests, that, they, are, primarily, a, literary, trope, used, by, lucian, to, deflect, accusations, that, he, as, the, syrian, author, has, somehow, outraged, the, purity, of, greek, idiom, or, genre, through, his, invention, of, the, comic, dialogue, british, classicist, donald, russell, states, a, good, deal, of, what, lucian, says, about, himself, is, no, more, to, be, trusted, than, the, voyage, to, the, moon, that, he, recounts, so, persuasively, in, the, first, person, in, true, stories, and, warns, that, it, is, foolish, to, treat, as, autobiography, lucian, was, born, in, the, town, of, samosata, on, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, on, the, far, eastern, outskirts, of, the, roman, empire, samosata, had, been, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, commagene, until, 72, ad, when, it, was, annexed, by, vespasian, and, became, part, of, the, roman, province, of, syria, the, population, of, the, town, was, mostly, syrian, and, lucian, s, native, tongue, was, probably, syriac, a, form, of, middle, aramaic, during, the, time, when, lucian, lived, traditional, greco, roman, religion, was, in, decline, and, its, role, in, society, had, become, largely, ceremonial, as, a, substitute, for, traditional, religion, many, people, in, the, hellenistic, world, joined, mystery, cults, such, as, the, mysteries, of, isis, mithraism, the, cult, of, cybele, and, the, eleusinian, mysteries, superstition, had, always, been, common, throughout, ancient, society, but, it, was, especially, prevalent, during, the, second, century, most, educated, people, of, lucian, s, time, adhered, to, one, of, the, various, hellenistic, philosophies, of, which, the, major, ones, were, stoicism, platonism, peripateticism, pyrrhonism, and, epicureanism, every, major, town, had, its, own, university, and, these, universities, often, employed, professional, travelling, lecturers, who, were, frequently, paid, high, sums, of, money, to, lecture, about, various, philosophical, teachings, the, most, prestigious, center, of, learning, was, the, city, of, athens, in, greece, which, had, a, long, intellectual, history, according, to, lucian, s, oration, the, dream, which, classical, scholar, lionel, casson, states, he, probably, delivered, as, an, address, upon, returning, to, samosata, at, the, age, of, thirty, five, or, forty, after, establishing, his, reputation, as, a, great, orator, lucian, s, parents, were, lower, middle, class, and, his, uncles, owned, a, local, statue, making, shop, lucian, s, parents, could, not, afford, to, give, him, a, higher, education, so, after, he, completed, his, elementary, schooling, lucian, s, uncle, took, him, on, as, an, apprentice, and, began, teaching, him, how, to, sculpt, lucian, however, soon, proved, to, be, poor, at, sculpting, and, ruined, the, statue, he, had, been, working, on, his, uncle, beat, him, causing, him, to, run, off, lucian, fell, asleep, and, experienced, a, dream, in, which, he, was, being, fought, over, by, the, personifications, of, statuary, and, culture, he, decided, to, listen, to, culture, and, thus, sought, out, an, education, although, the, dream, has, long, been, treated, by, scholars, as, a, truthful, autobiography, of, lucian, its, historical, accuracy, is, questionable, at, best, classicist, simon, swain, calls, it, a, fine, but, rather, apocryphal, version, of, lucian, s, education, and, karin, schlapbach, calls, it, ironical, richter, argues, that, it, is, not, autobiographical, at, all, but, rather, a, prolalia, or, playful, literary, work, and, a, complicated, meditation, on, a, young, man, s, acquisition, of, paideia, russell, dismisses, the, dream, as, entirely, fictional, noting, we, recall, that, socrates, too, started, as, sculptor, and, ovid, s, vision, of, elegy, and, tragedy, amores, 3, 1, is, all, too, similar, to, lucian, s, in, lucian, s, double, indictment, the, personification, of, rhetoric, delivers, a, speech, in, which, she, describes, the, unnamed, defendant, who, is, described, as, a, syrian, author, of, transgressive, dialogues, at, the, time, she, found, him, as, a, young, man, wandering, in, ionia, in, anatolia, with, no, idea, what, he, ought, to, do, with, himself, she, describes, the, syrian, at, this, stage, in, his, career, as, still, speaking, in, a, barbarous, manner, and, all, but, wearing, a, caftan, in, the, assyrian, fashion, rhetoric, states, that, she, took, him, in, hand, and, gave, him, paideia, scholars, have, long, interpreted, the, syrian, in, this, work, as, lucian, himself, and, taken, this, speech, to, mean, that, lucian, ran, away, to, ionia, where, he, pursued, his, education, richter, however, argues, that, the, syrian, is, not, lucian, himself, but, rather, a, literary, device, lucian, uses, to, subvert, literary, and, ethnic, norms, ionia, was, the, center, of, rhetorical, learning, at, the, time, the, most, prestigious, universities, of, rhetoric, were, in, ephesus, and, smyrna, but, it, is, unlikely, that, lucian, could, have, afforded, to, pay, the, tuition, at, either, of, these, schools, it, is, not, known, how, lucian, obtained, his, education, but, somehow, he, managed, to, acquire, an, extensive, knowledge, of, rhetoric, as, well, as, classical, literature, and, philosophy, lucian, mentions, in, his, dialogue, the, fisherman, that, he, had, initially, attempted, to, apply, his, knowledge, of, rhetoric, and, become, a, lawyer, but, that, he, had, become, disillusioned, by, the, deceitfulness, of, the, trade, and, resolved, to, become, a, philosopher, instead, lucian, travelled, across, the, empire, lecturing, throughout, greece, italy, and, gaul, in, gaul, lucian, may, have, held, a, position, as, a, highly, paid, government, professor, in, around, 160, lucian, returned, to, ionia, as, a, wealthy, celebrity, he, visited, samosata, and, stayed, in, the, east, for, several, years, he, is, recorded, as, having, been, in, antioch, in, either, 162, or, 163, in, around, 165, he, bought, a, house, in, athens, and, invited, his, parents, to, come, live, with, him, in, the, city, lucian, must, have, married, at, some, point, during, his, travels, because, in, one, of, his, writings, he, mentions, having, a, son, at, this, point, lucian, lived, in, athens, for, around, a, decade, during, which, time, he, gave, up, lecturing, and, instead, devoted, his, attention, to, writing, it, was, during, this, decade, that, lucian, composed, nearly, all, his, most, famous, works, lucian, wrote, exclusively, in, greek, mainly, in, the, attic, greek, popular, during, the, second, sophistic, but, on, the, syrian, goddess, which, is, attributed, to, lucian, is, written, in, a, highly, successful, imitation, of, herodotus, ionic, greek, leading, some, scholars, to, believe, that, lucian, may, not, be, the, real, author, for, unknown, reasons, lucian, stopped, writing, around, 175, and, began, travelling, and, lecturing, again, during, the, reign, of, emperor, commodus, 180, 192, the, aging, lucian, may, have, been, appointed, to, a, lucrative, government, position, in, egypt, after, this, point, he, disappears, from, the, historical, record, entirely, and, nothing, is, known, about, his, death, lucian, s, philosophical, views, are, difficult, to, categorize, due, to, his, persistent, use, of, irony, and, sarcasm, in, the, fisherman, lucian, describes, himself, as, a, champion, of, philosophy, and, throughout, his, other, writings, he, characterizes, philosophy, as, a, morally, constructive, discipline, but, he, is, critical, of, pseudo, philosophers, whom, he, portrays, as, greedy, bad, tempered, sexually, immoral, hypocrites, lucian, was, not, known, to, be, a, member, of, any, of, the, major, philosophical, schools, in, his, philosophies, for, sale, he, makes, fun, of, members, of, every, school, lucian, was, critical, of, stoicism, and, platonism, because, he, regarded, them, as, encouraging, superstition, his, nigrinus, superficially, appears, to, be, a, eulogy, of, platonism, but, may, in, fact, be, satirical, or, merely, an, excuse, to, ridicule, roman, society, nonetheless, at, other, times, lucian, writes, approvingly, of, individual, philosophies, according, to, turner, although, lucian, makes, fun, of, skeptic, philosophers, he, displays, a, temperamental, inclination, towards, that, philosophy, edwyn, bevan, identifies, lucian, as, a, skeptic, and, in, his, hermotimus, lucian, rejects, all, philosophical, systems, as, contradictory, and, concludes, that, life, is, too, short, to, determine, which, of, them, comes, nearest, to, the, truth, so, the, best, solution, is, to, rely, on, common, sense, which, was, what, the, pyrrhonian, skeptics, advocated, the, maxim, that, eyes, are, better, witnesses, than, ears, is, echoed, repeatedly, throughout, several, of, lucian, s, dialogues, lucian, was, skeptical, of, oracles, though, he, was, by, no, means, the, only, person, of, his, time, to, voice, such, skepticism, lucian, rejected, belief, in, the, paranormal, regarding, it, as, superstition, in, his, dialogue, the, lover, of, lies, he, probably, voices, some, of, his, own, opinions, through, his, character, tychiades, perhaps, including, the, declaration, by, tychiades, that, he, does, not, believe, in, daemones, phantoms, or, ghosts, because, he, has, never, seen, such, things, tychiades, however, still, professes, belief, in, the, gods, existence, dinomachus, in, other, words, you, do, not, believe, in, the, existence, of, the, gods, since, you, maintain, that, cures, cannot, be, wrought, by, the, use, of, holy, names, tychiades, nay, say, not, so, my, dear, dinomachus, i, answered, the, gods, may, exist, and, these, things, may, yet, be, lies, i, respect, the, gods, i, see, the, cures, performed, by, them, i, see, their, beneficence, at, work, in, restoring, the, sick, through, the, medium, of, the, medical, faculty, and, their, drugs, asclepius, and, his, sons, after, him, compounded, soothing, medicines, and, healed, the, sick, without, the, lion, s, skin, and, field, mouse, process, according, to, everett, ferguson, lucian, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, cynics, the, dream, or, the, cock, timon, the, misanthrope, charon, or, inspectors, and, the, downward, journey, or, the, tyrant, all, display, cynic, themes, lucian, was, particularly, indebted, to, menippus, a, cynic, philosopher, and, satirist, of, the, third, century, bc, lucian, wrote, an, admiring, biography, of, the, philosopher, demonax, who, was, a, philosophical, eclectic, but, whose, ideology, most, closely, resembled, cynicism, demonax, s, main, divergence, from, the, cynics, was, that, he, did, not, disapprove, of, ordinary, life, paul, turner, observes, that, lucian, s, cynicus, reads, as, a, straightforward, defense, of, cynicism, but, also, remarks, that, lucian, savagely, ridicules, the, cynic, philosopher, peregrinus, in, his, passing, of, peregrinus, lucian, also, greatly, admired, epicurus, whom, he, describes, in, alexander, the, false, prophet, as, truly, holy, and, prophetic, later, in, the, same, dialogue, he, praises, a, book, written, by, epicurus, what, blessings, that, book, creates, for, its, readers, and, what, peace, tranquillity, and, freedom, it, engenders, in, them, liberating, them, as, it, does, from, terrors, and, apparitions, and, portents, from, vain, hopes, and, extravagant, cravings, developing, in, them, intelligence, and, truth, and, truly, purifying, their, understanding, not, with, torches, and, squills, and, that, sort, of, foolery, but, with, straight, thinking, truthfulness, and, frankness, lucian, had, a, generally, negative, opinion, of, herodotus, and, his, historiography, which, he, viewed, as, faulty, over, eighty, works, attributed, to, lucian, have, survived, these, works, belong, to, a, diverse, variety, of, styles, and, genres, and, include, comic, dialogues, rhetorical, essays, and, prose, fiction, lucian, s, writings, were, targeted, towards, a, highly, educated, upper, class, greek, audience, and, make, almost, constant, allusions, to, greek, cultural, history, leading, the, classical, scholar, r, bracht, branham, to, label, lucian, s, highly, sophisticated, style, the, comedy, of, tradition, by, the, time, lucian, s, writings, were, rediscovered, during, the, renaissance, most, of, the, works, of, literature, referenced, in, them, had, been, lost, or, forgotten, making, it, difficult, for, readers, of, later, periods, to, understand, his, works, lucian, was, one, of, the, earliest, novelists, in, western, civilization, in, a, true, story, a, fictional, narrative, work, written, in, prose, he, parodies, some, of, the, fantastic, tales, told, by, homer, in, the, odyssey, and, also, the, not, so, fantastic, tales, from, the, historian, thucydides, he, anticipated, modern, science, fiction, themes, including, voyages, to, the, moon, and, venus, extraterrestrial, life, interplanetary, warfare, and, artificial, life, nearly, two, millennia, before, jules, verne, and, h, g, wells, the, novel, is, often, regarded, as, the, earliest, known, work, of, science, fiction, the, novel, begins, with, an, explanation, that, the, story, is, not, at, all, true, and, that, everything, in, it, is, in, fact, a, complete, and, utter, lie, the, narrative, begins, with, lucian, and, his, fellow, travelers, journeying, out, past, the, pillars, of, heracles, blown, off, course, by, a, storm, they, come, to, an, island, with, a, river, of, wine, filled, with, fish, and, bears, a, marker, indicating, that, heracles, and, dionysus, have, traveled, to, this, point, and, trees, that, look, like, women, shortly, after, leaving, the, island, they, are, caught, up, by, a, whirlwind, and, taken, to, the, moon, where, they, find, themselves, embroiled, in, a, full, scale, war, between, the, king, of, the, moon, and, the, king, of, the, sun, over, colonization, of, the, morning, star, both, armies, include, bizarre, hybrid, lifeforms, the, armies, of, the, sun, win, the, war, by, clouding, over, the, moon, and, blocking, out, the, sun, s, light, both, parties, then, come, to, a, peace, agreement, lucian, then, describes, life, on, the, moon, and, how, it, is, different, from, life, on, earth, after, returning, to, earth, the, adventurers, are, swallowed, by, a, 200, mile, long, whale, in, whose, belly, they, discover, a, variety, of, fish, people, whom, they, wage, war, against, and, triumph, over, they, kill, the, whale, by, starting, a, bonfire, and, escape, by, propping, its, mouth, open, next, they, encounter, a, sea, of, milk, an, island, of, cheese, and, the, island, of, the, blessed, there, lucian, meets, the, heroes, of, the, trojan, war, other, mythical, men, and, animals, as, well, as, homer, and, pythagoras, they, find, sinners, being, punished, the, worst, of, them, being, the, ones, who, had, written, books, with, lies, and, fantasies, including, herodotus, and, ctesias, after, leaving, the, island, of, the, blessed, they, deliver, a, letter, to, calypso, given, to, them, by, odysseus, explaining, that, he, wishes, he, had, stayed, with, her, so, he, could, have, lived, eternally, they, then, discover, a, chasm, in, the, ocean, but, eventually, sail, around, it, discover, a, far, off, continent, and, decide, to, explore, it, the, book, ends, abruptly, with, lucian, stating, that, their, future, adventures, will, be, described, in, the, upcoming, sequels, a, promise, which, a, disappointed, scholiast, described, as, the, biggest, lie, of, all, in, his, double, indictment, lucian, declares, that, his, proudest, literary, achievement, is, the, invention, of, the, satirical, dialogue, which, was, modeled, on, the, earlier, platonic, dialogue, but, was, comedic, in, tone, rather, than, philosophical, the, prolaliai, to, his, dialogues, of, the, courtesans, suggests, that, lucian, acted, out, his, dialogues, himself, as, part, of, a, comedic, routine, lucian, s, dialogues, of, the, dead, is, a, satirical, work, centering, around, the, cynic, philosophers, diogenes, and, his, pupil, menippus, who, lived, modestly, while, they, were, alive, and, are, now, living, comfortably, in, the, abysmal, conditions, of, the, underworld, while, those, who, had, lived, lives, of, luxury, are, in, torment, when, faced, by, the, same, conditions, the, dialogue, draws, on, earlier, literary, precursors, including, the, nekyia, in, book, xi, of, homer, s, odyssey, but, also, adds, new, elements, not, found, in, them, homer, s, nekyia, describes, transgressors, against, the, gods, being, punished, for, their, sins, but, lucian, embellished, this, idea, by, having, cruel, and, greedy, persons, also, be, punished, in, his, dialogue, the, lover, of, lies, lucian, satirizes, belief, in, the, supernatural, and, paranormal, through, a, framing, story, in, which, the, main, narrator, a, skeptic, named, tychiades, goes, to, visit, an, elderly, friend, named, eukrates, at, eukrates, s, house, he, encounters, a, large, group, of, guests, who, have, recently, gathered, together, due, to, eukrates, suddenly, falling, ill, the, other, guests, offer, eukrates, a, variety, of, folk, remedies, to, help, him, recover, when, tychiades, objects, that, such, remedies, do, not, work, the, others, all, laugh, at, him, and, try, to, persuade, him, to, believe, in, the, supernatural, by, telling, him, stories, which, grow, increasingly, ridiculous, as, the, conversation, progresses, one, of, the, last, stories, they, tell, is, the, sorcerer, s, apprentice, which, the, german, playwright, goethe, later, adapted, into, a, famous, ballad, lucian, frequently, made, fun, of, philosophers, and, no, school, was, spared, from, his, mockery, in, the, dialogue, philosophies, for, sale, lucian, creates, an, imaginary, slave, market, in, which, zeus, puts, famous, philosophers, up, for, sale, including, pythagoras, diogenes, heraclitus, socrates, chrysippus, and, pyrrho, each, of, whom, attempts, to, persuade, the, customers, to, buy, his, philosophy, in, the, banquet, or, lapiths, lucian, points, out, the, hypocrisies, of, representatives, from, all, the, major, philosophical, schools, in, the, fisherman, or, the, dead, come, to, life, lucian, defends, his, other, dialogues, by, comparing, the, venerable, philosophers, of, ancient, times, with, their, unworthy, contemporary, followers, lucian, was, often, particularly, critical, of, people, who, pretended, to, be, philosophers, when, they, really, were, not, and, his, dialogue, the, runaways, portrays, an, imposter, cynic, as, the, antithesis, of, true, philosophy, his, symposium, is, a, parody, of, plato, s, symposium, in, which, instead, of, discussing, the, nature, of, love, the, philosophers, get, drunk, tell, smutty, tales, argue, relentlessly, over, whose, school, is, the, best, and, eventually, break, out, into, a, full, scale, brawl, in, icaromenippus, the, cynic, philosopher, menippus, fashions, a, set, of, wings, for, himself, in, imitation, of, the, mythical, icarus, and, flies, to, heaven, where, he, receives, a, guided, tour, from, zeus, himself, the, dialogue, ends, with, zeus, announcing, his, decision, to, destroy, all, philosophers, since, all, they, do, is, bicker, though, he, agrees, to, grant, them, a, temporary, reprieve, until, spring, nektyomanteia, is, a, dialogue, written, in, parallel, to, icaromenippus, in, which, rather, than, flying, to, heaven, menippus, descends, to, the, underworld, to, consult, the, prophet, tiresias, lucian, wrote, numerous, dialogues, making, fun, of, traditional, greek, stories, about, the, gods, his, dialogues, of, the, gods, consists, of, numerous, short, vignettes, parodying, a, variety, of, the, scenes, from, greek, mythology, the, dialogues, portray, the, gods, as, comically, weak, and, prone, to, all, the, foibles, of, human, emotion, zeus, in, particular, is, shown, to, be, a, feckless, ruler, and, a, serial, adulterer, lucian, also, wrote, several, other, works, in, a, similar, vein, including, zeus, catechized, zeus, rants, and, the, parliament, of, the, gods, throughout, all, his, dialogues, lucian, displays, a, particular, fascination, with, hermes, the, messenger, of, the, gods, who, frequently, appears, as, a, major, character, in, the, role, of, an, intermediary, who, travels, between, worlds, the, dialogues, of, the, courtesans, is, a, collection, of, short, dialogues, involving, various, courtesans, this, collection, is, unique, as, one, of, the, only, surviving, works, of, greek, literature, to, mention, female, homosexuality, it, is, also, unusual, for, mixing, lucian, s, characters, from, other, dialogues, with, stock, characters, from, new, comedy, over, half, of, the, men, mentioned, in, dialogues, of, the, courtesans, are, also, mentioned, in, lucian, s, other, dialogues, but, almost, all, of, the, courtesans, themselves, are, characters, borrowed, from, the, plays, of, menander, and, other, comedic, playwrights, lucian, s, treatise, alexander, the, false, prophet, describes, the, rise, of, alexander, of, abonoteichus, a, charlatan, who, claimed, to, be, the, prophet, of, the, serpent, god, glycon, though, the, account, is, satirical, in, tone, it, seems, to, be, a, largely, accurate, report, of, the, glycon, cult, and, many, of, lucian, s, statements, about, the, cult, have, been, confirmed, through, archaeological, evidence, including, coins, statues, and, inscriptions, lucian, describes, his, own, meeting, with, alexander, in, which, he, posed, as, a, friendly, philosopher, but, when, alexander, invited, him, to, kiss, his, hand, lucian, bit, it, instead, lucian, reports, that, aside, from, himself, the, only, others, who, dared, challenge, alexander, s, reputation, as, a, true, prophet, were, the, epicureans, whom, he, lauds, as, heroes, and, the, christians, lucian, s, treatise, on, the, syrian, goddess, is, a, detailed, description, of, the, cult, of, the, syrian, goddess, atargatis, at, hierapolis, now, manbij, it, is, written, in, a, faux, ionic, greek, and, imitates, the, ethnographic, methodology, of, the, greek, historian, herodotus, which, lucian, elsewhere, derides, as, faulty, for, generations, many, scholars, doubted, the, authenticity, of, on, the, syrian, goddess, because, it, seemed, too, genuinely, reverent, to, have, really, been, written, by, lucian, more, recently, scholars, have, come, to, recognize, the, book, as, satirical, and, have, restored, its, lucianic, authorship, in, the, treatise, lucian, satirizes, the, arbitrary, cultural, distinctions, between, greeks, and, assyrians, by, emphasizing, the, manner, in, which, syrians, have, adopted, greek, customs, and, thereby, effectively, become, greeks, themselves, the, anonymous, narrator, of, the, treatise, initially, seems, to, be, a, greek, sophist, but, as, the, treatise, progresses, he, reveals, himself, to, actually, be, a, native, syrian, scholars, dispute, whether, the, treatise, is, an, accurate, description, of, syrian, cultural, practices, because, very, little, is, known, about, hierapolis, other, than, what, is, recorded, in, on, the, syrian, goddess, itself, coins, minted, in, the, late, fourth, century, bc, municipal, decrees, from, seleucid, rulers, and, a, late, hellenistic, relief, carving, have, confirmed, lucian, s, statement, that, the, city, s, original, name, was, manbog, and, that, the, city, was, closely, associated, with, the, cults, of, atargatis, and, hadad, a, jewish, rabbi, later, listed, the, temple,

describes, how, long, each, of, them, lived, and, gives, an, account, of, each, of, their, deaths, in, his, treatises, teacher, of, rhetoric, and, on, salaried, posts, lucian, criticizes, the, teachings, of, master, rhetoricians, his, treatise, on, dancing, is, a, major, source, of, information, about, greco, roman, dance, in, it, he, describes, dance, as, an, act, of, mimesis, imitation, and, rationalizes, the, myth, of, proteus, as, being, nothing, more, than, an, account, of, a, highly, skilled, egyptian, dancer, he, also, wrote, about, visual, arts, in, portraits, and, on, behalf, of, portraits, lucian, s, biography, of, the, philosopher, demonax, eulogizes, him, as, a, great, philosopher, and, portrays, him, as, a, hero, of, parrhesia, boldness, of, speech, in, his, treatise, how, to, write, history, lucian, criticizes, the, historical, methodology, used, by, writers, such, as, herodotus, and, ctesias, who, wrote, vivid, and, self, indulgent, descriptions, of, events, they, had, never, actually, seen, instead, lucian, argues, that, the, historian, never, embellish, his, stories, and, should, place, his, commitment, to, accuracy, above, his, desire, to, entertain, his, audience, he, also, argues, the, historian, should, remain, absolutely, impartial, and, tell, the, events, as, they, really, happened, even, if, they, are, likely, to, cause, disapproval, lucian, names, thucydides, as, a, specific, example, of, a, historian, who, models, these, virtues, in, his, satirical, letter, passing, of, peregrinus, lucian, describes, the, death, of, the, controversial, cynic, philosopher, peregrinus, proteus, who, had, publicly, immolated, himself, on, a, pyre, at, the, olympic, games, of, ad, 165, the, letter, is, historically, significant, because, it, preserves, one, of, the, earliest, pagan, evaluations, of, christianity, in, the, letter, one, of, lucian, s, characters, delivers, a, speech, ridiculing, christians, for, their, perceived, credulity, and, ignorance, but, he, also, affords, them, some, level, of, respect, on, account, of, their, morality, in, the, letter, against, the, ignorant, book, collector, lucian, ridicules, the, common, practice, whereby, near, easterners, collect, massive, libraries, of, greek, texts, for, the, sake, of, appearing, cultured, but, without, actually, reading, any, of, them, some, of, the, writings, attributed, to, lucian, such, as, the, amores, and, the, ass, are, usually, not, considered, genuine, works, of, lucian, and, are, normally, cited, under, the, name, of, pseudo, lucian, the, ass, o, is, probably, a, summarized, version, of, a, story, by, lucian, and, contains, largely, the, same, basic, plot, elements, as, the, golden, ass, or, metamorphoses, of, apuleius, but, with, fewer, inset, tales, and, a, different, ending, amores, is, usually, dated, to, the, third, or, fourth, centuries, based, on, stylistic, grounds, lucian, is, mentioned, only, sporadically, between, his, death, and, the, ninth, century, even, among, pagan, authors, the, first, author, to, mention, him, is, lactantius, he, is, made, a, character, in, the, sixth, century, letters, of, aristaenetus, in, the, same, century, portions, of, his, on, slander, were, translated, into, syriac, as, part, of, a, monastic, compendium, he, was, reassessed, positively, in, the, ninth, century, by, the, first, generation, of, byzantine, humanists, such, as, leo, the, mathematician, basil, of, adada, and, photios, in, his, bibliotheca, photios, notes, that, lucian, ridicules, pagan, things, in, almost, all, his, texts, is, never, serious, and, never, reveals, his, own, opinion, in, the, tenth, century, lucian, was, known, in, some, circles, as, an, anti, christian, writer, as, seen, in, the, works, of, arethas, of, caesarea, and, the, suda, encyclopedia, the, authors, of, the, suda, concludes, that, lucian, s, soul, is, burning, in, hell, for, his, negative, remarks, about, christians, in, the, passing, of, peregrinus, in, general, however, the, byzantine, reception, of, lucian, was, positive, he, was, perhaps, the, only, ancient, author, openly, hostile, to, christianity, to, be, received, positively, by, the, byzantines, he, was, regarded, as, not, merely, a, pagan, but, an, atheist, even, so, lucian, the, atheist, gave, way, to, lucian, the, master, of, style, from, the, eleventh, century, he, was, a, part, of, the, school, curriculum, there, was, a, lucianic, revival, in, the, twelfth, century, the, preeminent, lucianic, author, of, this, period, who, imitated, lucian, s, style, in, his, own, works, was, theodore, prodromos, in, the, norman, arab, byzantine, culture, of, twelfth, century, sicily, lucian, influenced, the, greek, authors, philagathus, of, cerami, and, eugenius, of, palermo, in, the, west, lucian, s, writings, were, mostly, forgotten, during, the, middle, ages, when, they, were, rediscovered, in, the, west, around, 1400, they, immediately, became, popular, with, the, renaissance, humanists, by, 1400, there, were, just, as, many, latin, translations, of, the, works, of, lucian, as, there, were, for, the, writings, of, plato, and, plutarch, by, ridiculing, plutocracy, as, absurd, lucian, helped, facilitate, one, of, renaissance, humanism, s, most, basic, themes, his, dialogues, of, the, dead, were, especially, popular, and, were, widely, used, for, moral, instruction, as, a, result, of, this, popularity, lucian, s, writings, had, a, profound, influence, on, writers, from, the, renaissance, and, the, early, modern, period, many, early, modern, european, writers, adopted, lucian, s, lighthearted, tone, his, technique, of, relating, a, fantastic, voyage, through, a, familiar, dialogue, and, his, trick, of, constructing, proper, names, with, deliberately, humorous, etymological, meanings, during, the, protestant, reformation, lucian, provided, literary, precedent, for, writers, making, fun, of, catholic, clergy, desiderius, erasmus, s, encomium, moriae, 1509, displays, lucianic, influences, perhaps, the, most, notable, example, of, lucian, s, impact, in, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, was, on, the, french, writer, fran, ois, rabelais, particularly, in, his, set, of, five, novels, gargantua, and, pantagruel, which, was, first, published, in, 1532, rabelais, also, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, a, primary, introduction, of, lucian, to, the, french, renaissance, and, beyond, through, his, translations, of, lucian, s, works, lucian, s, true, story, inspired, both, sir, thomas, more, s, utopia, 1516, and, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, 1726, sandro, botticelli, s, paintings, the, calumny, of, apelles, and, pallas, and, the, centaur, are, both, based, on, descriptions, of, paintings, found, in, lucian, s, works, lucian, s, prose, narrative, timon, the, misanthrope, was, the, inspiration, for, william, shakespeare, s, tragedy, timon, of, athens, and, the, scene, from, hamlet, with, the, gravediggers, echoes, several, scenes, from, dialogues, of, the, dead, christopher, marlowe, s, famous, verse, was, this, the, face, that, launched, a, thousand, ships, and, burnt, the, topless, towers, of, ilium, is, a, paraphrase, of, lucian, hermes, this, skull, is, helen, menippos, and, for, this, a, thousand, ships, carried, warriors, from, every, part, of, greece, greeks, and, barbarians, were, slain, and, cities, made, desolate, francis, bacon, called, lucian, a, contemplative, atheist, henry, fielding, the, author, of, the, history, of, tom, jones, a, foundling, 1749, owned, a, complete, set, of, lucian, s, writings, in, nine, volumes, he, deliberately, imitated, lucian, in, his, journey, from, this, world, and, into, the, next, and, in, the, life, and, death, of, jonathan, wild, the, great, 1743, he, describes, lucian, as, almost, like, the, true, father, of, humour, and, lists, him, alongside, miguel, de, cervantes, and, jonathan, swift, as, a, true, master, of, satire, in, the, convent, garden, journal, fielding, directly, states, in, regard, to, lucian, that, he, had, modeled, his, style, upon, that, very, author, nicolas, boileau, despr, aux, fran, ois, f, nelon, bernard, le, bovier, de, fontenelle, and, voltaire, all, wrote, adaptations, of, lucian, s, dialogues, of, the, dead, according, to, turner, voltaire, s, candide, 1759, displays, the, characteristically, lucianic, theme, of, refuting, philosophical, theory, by, reality, voltaire, also, wrote, the, conversation, between, lucian, erasmus, and, rabelais, in, the, elysian, fields, a, dialogue, in, which, he, treats, lucian, as, one, of, his, masters, in, the, strategy, of, intellectual, revolution, denis, diderot, drew, inspiration, from, the, writings, of, lucian, in, his, socrates, gone, mad, or, the, dialogues, of, diogenes, of, sinope, 1770, and, his, conversations, in, elysium, 1780, lucian, appears, as, one, of, two, speakers, in, diderot, s, dialogue, peregrinus, proteus, 1791, which, was, based, on, the, passing, of, peregrinus, lucian, s, true, story, inspired, cyrano, de, bergerac, whose, writings, later, served, as, inspiration, for, jules, verne, the, german, satirist, christoph, martin, wieland, was, the, first, person, to, translate, the, complete, works, of, lucian, into, german, and, he, spent, his, entire, career, adapting, the, ideas, behind, lucian, s, writings, for, a, contemporary, german, audience, david, hume, admired, lucian, as, a, very, moral, writer, and, quoted, him, with, reverence, when, discussing, ethics, or, religion, hume, read, lucian, s, kataplous, or, downward, journey, when, he, was, on, his, deathbed, herman, melville, references, lucian, in, chapter, 5, of, the, confidence, man, book, 26, of, pierre, and, chapter, 13, of, israel, potter, thomas, carlyle, s, epithet, phallus, worship, which, he, used, to, describe, the, contemporary, literature, of, french, writers, such, as, honor, de, balzac, and, george, sand, was, inspired, by, his, reading, of, lucian, kataplous, or, downward, journey, also, served, as, the, source, for, friedrich, nietzsche, s, concept, of, the, bermensch, or, overman, nietzsche, declaration, of, a, new, and, super, human, way, of, laughing, at, the, expense, of, everything, serious, echoes, the, exact, wording, of, tiresias, s, final, advice, to, the, eponymous, hero, of, lucian, s, dialogue, menippus, laugh, a, great, deal, and, take, nothing, seriously, professional, philosophical, writers, since, then, have, generally, ignored, lucian, but, turner, comments, that, perhaps, his, spirit, is, still, alive, in, those, who, like, bertrand, russell, are, prepared, to, flavor, philosophy, with, wit, many, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, classicists, viewed, lucian, s, works, negatively, the, german, classicist, eduard, norden, admitted, that, he, had, as, a, foolish, youth, wasted, time, reading, the, works, of, lucian, but, as, an, adult, had, come, to, realize, that, lucian, was, nothing, more, than, an, oriental, without, depth, or, character, who, has, no, soul, and, degrades, the, most, soulful, language, rudolf, helm, one, of, the, leading, scholars, on, lucian, in, the, early, twentieth, century, labelled, lucian, as, a, thoughtless, syrian, who, possesses, none, of, the, soul, of, a, tragedian, and, compared, him, to, the, poet, heinrich, heine, who, was, known, as, the, mockingbird, in, the, german, poetry, forest, in, his, 1906, publication, lukian, und, menipp, lucian, and, menippus, helm, argued, that, lucian, s, claims, of, generic, originality, especially, his, claim, of, having, invented, the, comic, dialogue, were, actually, lies, intended, to, cover, up, his, almost, complete, dependence, on, menippus, whom, he, argued, was, the, true, inventor, of, the, genre, lucian, s, syrian, identity, received, renewed, attention, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, as, lucian, became, seen, as, what, richter, calls, a, sort, of, second, sophistic, answer, to, early, twenty, first, century, questions, about, cultural, and, ethnic, hybridity, richter, states, that, postcolonial, critics, have, come, to, embrace, lucian, as, an, early, imperial, paradigm, of, the, ethno, cultural, hybrid
