because, they, think, she, is, diabolical, and, cast, out, she, is, protected, by, a, glowing, mountain, grotto, according, to, herself, riefenstahl, received, invitations, to, travel, to, hollywood, to, create, films, but, she, refused, them, in, favor, of, remaining, in, germany, with, a, boyfriend, hitler, was, a, fan, of, the, film, and, thought, riefenstahl, epitomized, the, perfect, german, female, he, saw, talent, in, riefenstahl, and, arranged, a, meeting, in, 1933, riefenstahl, appeared, in, the, u, s, german, co, productions, of, the, arnold, fanck, directed, german, language, sos,

1932, and, was, mesmerized, by, his, talent, as, a, public, speaker, describing, the, experience, in, her, memoir, riefenstahl, wrote, i, had, an, almost, apocalyptic, vision, that, i, was, never, able, to, forget, it, seemed, as, if, the, earth, s, surface, were, spreading, out, in, front, of, me, like, a, hemisphere, that, suddenly, splits, apart, in, the, middle, spewing, out, an, enormous, jet, of, water, so, powerful, that, it, touched, the, sky, and, shook, the, earth, hitler, was, immediately, captivated, by, riefenstahl, s, work, she, is, described, as, fitting, in, with, hitler, s, ideal, of, aryan, womanhood, a, feature, he, had, noted, when, he, saw, her, starring, performance, in, das, blaue, licht, in, may, 1933, hitler, asked, riefenstahl, to, make, a, film, about, horst, wessel, but, she, declined, riefenstahl, was, offered, the, opportunity, to, direct, der, sieg, des, glaubens, an, hour, long, propaganda, film, about, the, fifth, nuremberg, rally, in, 1933, the, opportunity, that, was, offered, was, a, huge, surprise, to, riefenstahl, hitler, had, ordered, joseph, goebbels, s, propaganda, ministry, to, give, the, film, commission, to, riefenstahl, but, the, ministry, had, never, informed, her, riefenstahl, agreed, to, direct, the, movie, even, though, she, was, only, given, a, few, days, before, the, rally, to, prepare, she, and, hitler, got, on, well, forming, a, friendly, relationship, the, propaganda, film, was, funded, entirely, by, the, nsdap, during, the, filming, of, der, sieg, des, glaubens, hitler, had, stood, side, by, side, with, the, leader, of, the, sturmabteilung, sa, ernst, r, hm, a, man, with, whom, he, clearly, had, a, close, working, relationship, r, hm, was, murdered, on, hitler, s, orders, a, short, time, later, during, the, purge, of, the, sa, referred, to, as, the, night, of, the, long, knives, it, has, gone, on, record, that, immediately, following, the, killings, hitler, ordered, all, copies, of, the, film, to, be, destroyed, although, riefenstahl, disputed, that, this, ever, happened, still, impressed, with, riefenstahl, s, work, hitler, asked, her, to, film, triumph, des, willens, triumph, of, the, will, a, new, propaganda, film, about, the, 1934, party, rally, in, nuremberg, more, than, one, million, germans, participated, in, the, rally, the, film, is, sometimes, considered, the, greatest, propaganda, film, ever, made, initially, according, to, riefenstahl, she, resisted, and, did, not, want, to, create, further, nazi, party, films, instead, wanting, to, direct, a, feature, film, based, on, eugen, d, albert, s, tiefland, lowlands, an, opera, that, was, extremely, popular, in, berlin, in, the, 1920s, riefenstahl, received, private, funding, for, the, production, of, tiefland, but, the, filming, in, spain, was, derailed, and, the, project, was, cancelled, when, tiefland, was, eventually, shot, between, 1940, and, 1944, it, was, done, in, black, and, white, and, was, the, third, most, expensive, film, produced, in, nazi, germany, during, the, filming, of, tiefland, riefenstahl, utilized, romani, from, internment, camps, for, extras, who, were, severely, mistreated, on, set, and, when, the, filming, completed, they, were, sent, to, the, death, camp, auschwitz, hitler, was, able, to, convince, her, to, film, triumph, des, willens, on, the, condition, that, she, would, not, be, required, to, make, further, films, for, the, party, according, to, riefenstahl, the, motion, picture, was, generally, recognized, as, an, epic, innovative, work, of, propaganda, filmmaking, the, film, took, riefenstahl, s, career, to, a, new, level, and, gave, her, further, international, recognition, in, interviews, for, the, 1993, documentary, the, wonderful, horrible, life, of, leni, riefenstahl, riefenstahl, adamantly, denied, any, deliberate, attempt, to, create, nazi, propaganda, and, said, she, was, disgusted, that, triumph, des, willens, was, used, in, such, a, way, despite, allegedly, vowing, not, to, make, any, more, films, about, the, nazi, party, riefenstahl, made, the, 28, minute, tag, der, freiheit, unsere, wehrmacht, day, of, freedom, our, armed, forces, about, the, german, army, in, 1935, like, der, sieg, des, glaubens, and, triumph, des, willens, this, was, filmed, at, the, annual, nazi, party, rally, at, nuremberg, riefenstahl, said, this, film, was, a, sub, set, of, der, sieg, des, glaubens, added, to, mollify, the, german, army, which, felt, it, was, not, represented, well, in, triumph, des, willens, hitler, invited, riefenstahl, to, film, the, 1936, summer, olympics, scheduled, to, be, held, in, berlin, a, film, which, riefenstahl, said, had, been, commissioned, by, the, international, olympic, committee, she, visited, greece, to, take, footage, of, the, route, of, the, inaugural, torch, relay, and, the, games, original, site, at, olympia, where, she, was, aided, by, greek, photographer, nelly, s, this, material, became, olympia, a, hugely, successful, film, which, has, since, been, widely, noted, for, its, technical, and, aesthetic, achievements, olympia, was, secretly, funded, by, the, nazis, she, was, one, of, the, first, filmmakers, to, use, tracking, shots, in, a, documentary, placing, a, camera, on, rails, to, follow, the, athletes, movement, the, film, is, also, noted, for, its, slow, motion, shots, riefenstahl, played, with, the, idea, of, slow, motion, underwater, diving, shots, extremely, high, and, low, shooting, angles, panoramic, aerial, shots, and, tracking, system, shots, for, allowing, fast, action, many, of, these, shots, were, relatively, unheard, of, at, the, time, but, riefenstahl, s, use, and, augmentation, of, them, set, a, standard, and, is, the, reason, they, are, still, used, to, this, day, riefenstahl, s, work, on, olympia, has, been, cited, as, a, major, influence, in, modern, sports, photography, riefenstahl, filmed, competitors, of, all, races, including, african, american, jesse, owens, in, what, later, became, famous, footage, olympia, premiered, for, hitler, s, 49th, birthday, in, 1938, its, international, debut, led, riefenstahl, to, embark, on, an, american, publicity, tour, in, an, attempt, to, secure, commercial, release, in, february, 1937, riefenstahl, enthusiastically, told, a, reporter, for, the, detroit, news, to, me, hitler, is, the, greatest, man, who, ever, lived, he, truly, is, without, fault, so, simple, and, at, the, same, time, possessed, of, masculine, strength, she, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 4, november, 1938, five, days, before, kristallnacht, the, night, of, the, broken, glass, when, news, of, the, event, reached, the, united, states, riefenstahl, publicly, defended, hitler, on, 18, november, she, was, received, by, henry, ford, in, detroit, olympia, was, shown, at, the, chicago, engineers, club, two, days, later, avery, brundage, president, of, the, international, olympic, committee, praised, the, film, and, held, riefenstahl, in, the, highest, regard, she, negotiated, with, louis, b, mayer, and, on, 8, december, walt, disney, brought, her, on, a, three, hour, tour, showing, her, the, ongoing, production, of, fantasia, from, the, goebbels, diaries, researchers, learned, that, riefenstahl, had, been, friendly, with, joseph, goebbels, and, his, wife, magda, attending, the, opera, with, them, and, going, to, his, parties, riefenstahl, maintained, that, goebbels, was, upset, when, she, rejected, his, advances, and, was, jealous, of, her, influence, on, hitler, seeing, her, as, an, internal, threat, she, therefore, insisted, his, diary, entries, could, not, be, trusted, by, later, accounts, goebbels, thought, highly, of, riefenstahl, s, filmmaking, but, was, angered, with, what, he, saw, as, her, overspending, on, the, nazi, provided, filmmaking, budgets, in, triumph, of, the, will, tom, saunders, argues, that, hitler, serves, as, the, object, of, the, camera, s, gaze, saunders, writes, without, denying, that, rampant, masculinity, the, sexiness, of, hitler, and, the, ss, serves, as, the, object, of, the, gaze, i, would, suggest, that, desire, is, also, directed, toward, the, feminine, this, occurs, not, in, the, familiar, sequences, of, adoring, women, greeting, hitler, s, arrival, and, cavalcade, through, nuremberg, in, these, hitler, clearly, remains, the, focus, of, attraction, as, more, generally, in, the, visual, treatment, of, his, mass, following, rather, it, is, encoded, in, representation, of, flags, and, banners, which, were, shot, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, them, visually, desirable, as, well, as, potent, political, symbols, the, flag, serves, as, a, symbol, of, masculinity, equated, with, national, pride, and, dominance, that, supposedly, channels, men, s, sexual, and, masculine, energy, riefenstahl, s, cinematic, framing, of, the, flags, encapsulated, its, iconography, saunders, continues, the, effect, is, a, significant, double, transformation, the, images, mechanize, human, beings, and, breathe, life, into, flags, even, when, the, carriers, are, not, mostly, submerged, under, the, sea, of, colored, cloth, and, when, facial, features, are, visible, in, profile, they, attain, neither, character, nor, distinctiveness, the, men, remain, ants, in, a, vast, enterprise, by, contrast, and, paradoxically, the, flags, whether, a, few, or, hundreds, peopling, the, frame, assume, distinct, identities, riefenstahl, distorts, the, diegetic, sound, in, triumph, of, the, will, her, distortion, of, sound, suggests, she, was, influenced, by, german, art, cinema, influenced, by, classical, hollywood, cinema, s, style, german, art, film, employed, music, to, enhance, the, narrative, establish, a, sense, of, grandeur, and, to, heighten, the, emotions, in, a, scene, in, triumph, of, the, will, riefenstahl, used, traditional, folk, music, to, accompany, and, intensify, her, shots, ben, morgan, comments, on, riefenstahl, s, distortion, of, sound, in, triumph, of, the, will, the, material, world, leaves, no, aural, impression, beyond, the, music, where, the, film, does, combine, diegetic, noise, with, the, music, the, effects, used, are, human, laughter, or, cheering, and, offer, a, rhythmic, extension, to, the, music, rather, than, a, contrast, to, it, by, replacing, diegetic, sound, riefenstahl, s, film, employs, music, to, combine, the, documentary, with, the, fantastic, when, germany, invaded, poland, on, 1, september, 1939, riefenstahl, was, photographed, in, poland, wearing, a, military, uniform, and, a, pistol, on, her, belt, in, the, company, of, german, soldiers, she, had, gone, to, poland, as, a, war, correspondent, on, 12, september, she, was, in, the, town, of, ko, skie, when, 30, civilians, were, executed, in, retaliation, for, an, alleged, attack, on, german, soldiers, according, to, her, memoir, riefenstahl, tried, to, intervene, but, a, furious, german, soldier, held, her, at, gunpoint, and, threatened, to, shoot, her, on, the, spot, she, said, she, did, not, realize, the, victims, were, jews, according, to, another, account, given, by, a, german, officer, riefenstahl, had, asked, that, the, jews, be, removed, from, the, market, which, was, relayed, to, the, soldiers, as, get, rid, of, the, jews, thus, leading, to, the, massacre, photographs, of, a, potentially, distraught, riefenstahl, survive, from, that, day, nevertheless, by, 5, october, 1939, riefenstahl, was, back, in, occupied, poland, filming, hitler, s, victory, parade, in, warsaw, afterwards, she, left, poland, and, chose, not, to, make, any, more, nazi, related, films, on, 14, june, 1940, the, day, paris, was, declared, an, open, city, by, the, french, and, occupied, by, german, troops, riefenstahl, wrote, to, hitler, in, a, telegram, with, indescribable, joy, deeply, moved, and, filled, with, burning, gratitude, we, share, with, you, my, f, hrer, your, and, germany, s, greatest, victory, the, entry, of, german, troops, into, paris, you, exceed, anything, human, imagination, has, the, power, to, conceive, achieving, deeds, without, parallel, in, the, history, of, mankind, how, can, we, ever, thank, you, she, later, explained, everyone, thought, the, war, was, over, and, in, that, spirit, i, sent, the, cable, to, hitler, riefenstahl, was, friends, with, hitler, for, 12, years, however, her, relationship, with, hitler, severely, declined, in, 1944, after, her, brother, died, on, the, russian, front, after, the, nuremberg, rallies, trilogy, and, olympia, riefenstahl, began, work, on, the, movie, she, had, tried, and, failed, to, direct, once, before, namely, tiefland, on, hitler, s, direct, order, the, german, government, paid, her, 7, million, in, compensation, from, 23, september, until, 13, november, 1940, she, filmed, in, kr, n, near, mittenwald, the, extras, playing, spanish, women, and, farmers, were, drawn, from, romani, detained, in, a, camp, at, salzburg, maxglan, who, were, forced, to, work, with, her, filming, at, the, babelsberg, studios, near, berlin, began, 18, months, later, in, april, 1942, this, time, sinti, and, roma, people, from, the, marzahn, detention, camp, near, berlin, were, compelled, to, work, as, extras, almost, to, the, end, of, her, life, despite, overwhelming, evidence, that, the, concentration, camp, occupants, had, been, forced, to, work, on, the, movie, were, later, sent, to, the, auschwitz, death, camp, riefenstahl, continued, to, maintain, that, all, the, film, extras, survived, riefenstahl, sued, filmmaker, nina, gladitz, who, said, riefenstahl, personally, chose, the, extras, at, their, holding, camp, gladitz, had, found, one, of, the, romani, survivors, and, matched, his, memory, with, stills, of, the, movie, for, a, documentary, gladitz, was, filming, the, german, court, ruled, largely, in, favour, of, gladitz, declaring, that, riefenstahl, had, known, the, extras, were, from, a, concentration, camp, but, they, also, agreed, that, riefenstahl, had, not, been, informed, the, romani, would, be, sent, to, auschwitz, after, filming, was, completed, this, issue, came, up, again, in, 2002, when, riefenstahl, was, 100, years, old, and, she, was, taken, to, court, by, a, roma, group, for, denying, the, nazis, had, exterminated, romani, riefenstahl, apologized, and, said, i, regret, that, sinti, and, roma, had, to, suffer, during, the, period, of, national, socialism, it, is, known, today, that, many, of, them, were, murdered, in, concentration, camps, in, october, 1944, the, production, of, tiefland, moved, to, barrandov, studios, in, prague, for, interior, filming, lavish, sets, made, these, shots, some, of, the, most, costly, of, the, film, the, film, was, not, edited, and, released, until, almost, ten, years, later, the, last, time, riefenstahl, saw, hitler, was, when, she, married, peter, jacob, on, 21, march, 1944, riefenstahl, and, jacob, divorced, in, 1946, as, germany, s, military, situation, became, impossible, by, early, 1945, riefenstahl, left, berlin, and, was, hitchhiking, with, a, group, of, men, trying, to, reach, her, mother, when, she, was, taken, into, custody, by, american, troops, she, walked, out, of, a, holding, camp, beginning, a, series, of, escapes, and, arrests, across, the, chaotic, landscape, at, last, making, it, back, home, on, a, bicycle, she, found, that, american, troops, had, seized, her, house, she, was, surprised, by, how, kindly, they, treated, her, most, of, riefenstahl, s, unfinished, projects, were, lost, towards, the, end, of, the, war, the, french, government, confiscated, all, of, her, editing, equipment, along, with, the, production, reels, of, tiefland, after, years, of, legal, wrangling, these, were, returned, to, her, but, the, french, government, had, reportedly, damaged, some, of, the, film, stock, whilst, trying, to, develop, and, edit, it, with, a, few, key, scenes, being, missing, although, riefenstahl, was, surprised, to, find, the, original, negatives, for, olympia, in, the, same, shipment, during, the, filming, of, olympia, riefenstahl, was, funded, by, the, state, to, create, her, own, production, company, in, her, own, name, riefenstahl, film, gmbh, which, was, uninvolved, with, her, most, influential, works, she, edited, and, dubbed, the, remaining, material, and, tiefland, premiered, on, 11, february, 1954, in, stuttgart, however, it, was, denied, entry, into, the, cannes, film, festival, although, riefenstahl, lived, for, almost, another, half, century, tiefland, was, her, last, feature, film, riefenstahl, tried, many, times, to, make, more, films, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, but, was, met, with, resistance, public, protests, and, sharp, criticism, many, of, her, filmmaking, peers, in, hollywood, had, fled, nazi, germany, and, were, unsympathetic, to, her, although, both, film, professionals, and, investors, were, willing, to, support, her, work, most, of, the, projects, she, attempted, were, stopped, owing, to, ever, renewed, and, highly, negative, publicity, about, her, past, work, in, nazi, germany, in, 1954, jean,
