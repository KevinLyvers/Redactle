andrei, dmitrievich, sakharov, russian, 21, may, 1921, 14, december, 1989, was, a, soviet, physicist, and, a, nobel, peace, prize, laureate, which, he, was, awarded, in, 1975, for, emphasizing, human, rights, around, the, world, although, he, spent, his, career, in, physics, in, the, soviet, program, of, nuclear, weapons, overseeing, the, development, of, thermonuclear, weapons, sakharov, also, did, fundamental, work, in, understanding, particle, physics, magnetism, and, physical, cosmology, sakharov, is, mostly, known, for, his, political, activism, for, individual, freedom, human, rights, civil, liberties, and, reforms, in, the, soviet, union, for, which, he, was, deemed, a, dissident, and, faced, persecution, from, the, soviet, establishment, in, his, memory, the, sakharov, prize, was, established, and, is, awarded, annually, by, the, european, parliament, for, people, and, organizations, dedicated, to, human, rights, and, freedoms, andrei, dmitrievich, sakharov, was, born, in, moscow, on, 21, may, 1921, to, a, russian, family, his, father, dmitri, ivanovich, sakharov, was, a, physics, professor, at, the, second, moscow, state, university, and, an, amateur, pianist, his, grandfather, ivan, was, a, lawyer, in, the, former, russian, empire, who, had, displayed, respect, for, social, awareness, and, humanitarian, principles, including, advocating, the, abolition, of, capital, punishment, sakharov, s, mother, yekaterina, alekseevna, sofiano, was, a, daughter, of, aleksey, semenovich, sofiano, a, general, in, the, tsarist, russian, army, with, greek, heritage, sakharov, s, parents, and, paternal, grandmother, maria, petrovna, largely, shaped, his, personality, his, mother, and, grandmother, were, members, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, although, his, father, was, a, non, believer, when, andrei, was, about, thirteen, he, realized, that, he, did, not, believe, in, god, however, despite, being, an, atheist, he, did, believe, in, a, guiding, principle, that, transcends, the, physical, laws, after, schooling, sakharov, studied, physics, at, the, moscow, state, university, in, 1938, and, following, evacuation, in, 1941, during, the, eastern, front, with, germany, he, graduated, in, a, gabat, in, turkmenistan, in, 1943, he, married, klavdia, alekseyevna, vikhireva, with, whom, he, raised, two, daughters, and, a, son, klavdia, would, later, die, in, 1969, in, 1945, he, joined, the, theoretical, department, of, physical, institute, of, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, under, igor, tamm, in, moscow, in, 1947, sakharov, was, successful, in, defending, his, thesis, for, the, doctor, of, sciences, lit, doktor, nauk, which, covered, the, topic, of, nuclear, transmutation, after, world, war, ii, he, researched, cosmic, rays, in, mid, 1948, he, participated, in, the, soviet, atomic, bomb, project, under, igor, kurchatov, and, igor, tamm, sakharov, s, study, group, at, fian, in, 1948, came, up, with, a, second, concept, in, august, september, 1948, adding, a, shell, of, natural, unenriched, uranium, around, the, deuterium, would, increase, the, deuterium, concentration, at, the, uranium, deuterium, boundary, and, the, overall, yield, of, the, device, because, the, natural, uranium, would, capture, neutrons, and, itself, fission, as, part, of, the, thermonuclear, reaction, this, idea, of, a, layered, fission, fusion, fission, bomb, led, sakharov, to, call, it, the, sloika, or, layered, cake, the, first, soviet, atomic, device, was, tested, on, august, 29, 1949, after, moving, to, sarov, in, 1950, sakharov, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, the, first, megaton, range, soviet, hydrogen, bomb, using, a, design, known, as, sakharov, s, third, idea, in, russia, and, the, teller, ulam, design, in, the, united, states, before, his, third, idea, sakharov, tried, a, layer, cake, of, alternating, layers, of, fission, and, fusion, fuel, the, results, were, disappointing, yielding, no, more, than, a, typical, fission, bomb, however, the, design, was, seen, to, be, worth, pursuing, because, deuterium, is, abundant, and, uranium, is, scarce, and, he, had, no, idea, how, powerful, the, us, design, was, sakharov, realised, that, in, order, to, cause, the, explosion, of, one, side, of, the, fuel, to, symmetrically, compress, the, fusion, fuel, a, mirror, could, be, used, to, reflect, the, radiation, the, details, had, not, been, officially, declassified, in, russia, when, sakharov, was, writing, his, memoirs, but, in, the, teller, ulam, design, soft, x, rays, emitted, by, the, fission, bomb, were, focused, onto, a, cylinder, of, lithium, deuteride, to, compress, it, symmetrically, this, is, called, radiation, implosion, the, teller, ulam, design, also, had, a, secondary, fission, device, inside, the, fusion, cylinder, to, assist, with, the, compression, of, the, fusion, fuel, and, generate, neutrons, to, convert, some, of, the, lithium, to, tritium, producing, a, mixture, of, deuterium, and, tritium, sakharov, s, idea, was, first, tested, as, rds, 37, in, 1955, a, larger, variation, of, the, same, design, which, sakharov, worked, on, was, the, 50, mt, tsar, bomba, of, october, 1961, which, was, the, most, powerful, nuclear, device, ever, detonated, sakharov, saw, striking, parallels, between, his, fate, and, those, of, j, robert, oppenheimer, and, edward, teller, in, the, us, sakharov, believed, that, in, this, tragic, confrontation, of, two, outstanding, people, both, deserved, respect, because, each, of, them, was, certain, he, had, right, on, his, side, and, was, morally, obligated, to, go, to, the, end, in, the, name, of, truth, while, sakharov, strongly, disagreed, with, teller, over, nuclear, testing, in, the, atmosphere, and, the, strategic, defense, initiative, he, believed, that, american, academics, had, been, unfair, to, teller, s, resolve, to, get, the, h, bomb, for, the, united, states, since, all, steps, by, the, americans, of, a, temporary, or, permanent, rejection, of, developing, thermonuclear, weapons, would, have, been, seen, either, as, a, clever, feint, or, as, the, manifestation, of, stupidity, in, both, cases, the, reaction, would, have, been, the, same, avoid, the, trap, and, immediately, take, advantage, of, the, enemy, s, stupidity, sakharov, never, felt, that, by, creating, nuclear, weapons, he, had, known, sin, in, oppenheimer, s, expression, he, later, wrote, after, more, than, forty, years, we, have, had, no, third, world, war, and, the, balance, of, nuclear, terror, may, have, helped, to, prevent, one, but, i, am, not, at, all, sure, of, this, back, then, in, those, long, gone, years, the, question, didn, t, even, arise, what, most, troubles, me, now, is, the, instability, of, the, balance, the, extreme, peril, of, the, current, situation, the, appalling, waste, of, the, arms, race, each, of, us, has, a, responsibility, to, think, about, this, in, global, terms, with, tolerance, trust, and, candor, free, from, ideological, dogmatism, parochial, interests, or, national, egotism, in, 1950, he, proposed, an, idea, for, a, controlled, nuclear, fusion, reactor, the, tokamak, which, is, still, the, basis, for, the, majority, of, work, in, the, area, sakharov, in, association, with, tamm, proposed, confining, extremely, hot, ionized, plasma, by, torus, shaped, magnetic, fields, for, controlling, thermonuclear, fusion, that, led, to, the, development, of, the, tokamak, device, in, 1951, he, invented, and, tested, the, first, explosively, pumped, flux, compression, generators, compressing, magnetic, fields, by, explosives, he, called, these, devices, mk, for, magnetokumulative, generators, the, radial, mk, 1, produced, a, pulsed, magnetic, field, of, 25, megagauss, 2500, teslas, the, resulting, helical, mk, 2, generated, 1000, million, amperes, in, 1953, sakharov, then, tested, a, mk, driven, plasma, cannon, where, a, small, aluminum, ring, was, vaporized, by, huge, eddy, currents, into, a, stable, self, confined, toroidal, plasmoid, and, was, accelerated, to, 100, km, s, sakharov, later, suggested, replacing, the, copper, coil, in, mk, generators, with, a, large, superconductor, solenoid, to, magnetically, compress, and, focus, underground, nuclear, explosions, into, a, shaped, charge, effect, he, theorized, this, could, focus, 10, 23, protons, per, second, on, a, 1, mm, 2, surface, after, 1965, sakharov, returned, to, fundamental, science, and, began, working, on, particle, physics, and, physical, cosmology, he, tried, to, explain, the, baryon, asymmetry, of, the, universe, in, that, regard, he, was, the, first, to, give, a, theoretical, motivation, for, proton, decay, proton, decay, was, suggested, by, wigner, in, 1949, and, 1952, proton, decay, experiments, had, been, performed, since, 1954, already, sakharov, was, the, first, to, consider, cpt, symmetric, events, occurring, before, the, big, bang, we, can, visualize, that, neutral, spinless, maximons, or, photons, are, produced, at, t, 0, from, contracting, matter, having, an, excess, of, antiquarks, that, they, pass, one, through, the, other, at, the, instant, t, 0, when, the, density, is, infinite, and, decay, with, an, excess, of, quarks, when, t, 0, realizing, total, cpt, symmetry, of, the, universe, all, the, phenomena, at, t, 0, are, assumed, in, this, hypothesis, to, be, cpt, reflections, of, the, phenomena, at, t, 0, his, legacy, in, this, domain, are, the, famous, conditions, named, after, him, baryon, number, violation, c, symmetry, and, cp, symmetry, violation, and, interactions, out, of, thermal, equilibrium, sakharov, was, also, interested, in, explaining, why, the, curvature, of, the, universe, is, so, small, this, led, him, to, consider, cyclic, models, where, the, universe, oscillates, between, contraction, and, expansion, phases, in, those, models, after, a, certain, number, of, cycles, the, curvature, naturally, becomes, infinite, even, if, it, had, not, started, this, way, sakharov, considered, three, starting, points, a, flat, universe, with, a, slightly, negative, cosmological, constant, a, universe, with, a, positive, curvature, and, a, zero, cosmological, constant, and, a, universe, with, a, negative, curvature, and, a, slightly, negative, cosmological, constant, those, last, two, models, feature, what, sakharov, calls, a, reversal, of, the, time, arrow, which, can, be, summarized, as, follows, he, considers, times, t, 0, after, the, initial, big, bang, singularity, at, t, 0, which, he, calls, friedman, singularity, and, denotes, as, well, as, times, t, 0, before, that, singularity, he, then, assumes, that, entropy, increases, when, time, increases, for, t, 0, as, well, as, when, time, decreases, for, t, 0, which, constitutes, his, reversal, of, time, then, he, considers, the, case, when, the, universe, at, t, 0, is, the, image, of, the, universe, at, t, 0, under, cpt, symmetry, but, also, the, case, when, it, is, not, so, the, universe, has, a, non, zero, cpt, charge, at, t, 0, in, this, case, sakharov, considers, a, variant, of, this, model, where, the, reversal, of, the, time, arrow, occurs, at, a, point, of, maximum, entropy, instead, of, happening, at, the, singularity, in, those, models, there, is, no, dynamic, interaction, between, the, universe, at, t, 0, and, t, 0, in, his, first, model, the, two, universes, did, not, interact, except, via, local, matter, accumulation, whose, density, and, pressure, become, high, enough, to, connect, the, two, sheets, through, a, bridge, without, spacetime, between, them, but, with, a, continuity, of, geodesics, beyond, the, schwarzschild, radius, with, no, singularity, allowing, an, exchange, of, matter, between, the, two, conjugated, sheets, based, on, an, idea, after, igor, dmitriyevich, novikov, novikov, called, such, singularities, a, collapse, and, an, anticollapse, which, are, an, alternative, to, the, couple, black, hole, and, white, hole, in, the, wormhole, model, sakharov, also, proposed, the, idea, of, induced, gravity, as, an, alternative, theory, of, quantum, gravity, since, the, late, 1950s, sakharov, had, become, concerned, about, the, moral, and, political, implications, of, his, work, politically, active, during, the, 1960s, sakharov, was, against, nuclear, proliferation, pushing, for, the, end, of, atmospheric, tests, he, played, a, role, in, the, 1963, partial, test, ban, treaty, signed, in, moscow, sakharov, was, also, involved, in, an, event, with, political, consequences, in, 1964, when, the, soviet, academy, of, sciences, nominated, for, full, membership, nikolai, nuzhdin, a, follower, of, trofim, lysenko, initiator, of, the, stalin, supported, anti, genetics, campaign, lysenkoism, contrary, to, normal, practice, sakharov, a, member, of, the, academy, publicly, spoke, out, against, full, membership, for, nuzhdin, and, held, him, responsible, for, the, defamation, firing, arrest, even, death, of, many, genuine, scientists, 109, in, the, end, nuzhdin, was, not, elected, but, the, episode, prompted, nikita, khrushchev, to, order, the, kgb, to, gather, compromising, material, on, sakharov, 109, the, major, turn, in, sakharov, s, political, evolution, came, in, 1967, when, anti, ballistic, missile, defense, became, a, key, issue, in, us, soviet, relations, in, a, secret, detailed, letter, to, the, soviet, leadership, of, july, 21, 1967, sakharov, explained, the, need, to, take, the, americans, at, their, word, and, accept, their, proposal, for, a, bilateral, rejection, by, the, usa, and, the, soviet, union, of, the, development, of, antiballistic, missile, defense, because, an, arms, race, in, the, new, technology, would, otherwise, increase, the, likelihood, of, nuclear, war, he, also, asked, permission, to, publish, his, manuscript, which, accompanied, the, letter, in, a, newspaper, to, explain, the, dangers, posed, by, that, kind, of, defense, the, government, ignored, his, letter, and, refused, to, let, him, initiate, a, public, discussion, of, abms, in, the, soviet, press, since, 1967, after, the, six, day, war, and, the, beginning, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, he, actively, supported, israel, as, he, reported, more, than, once, in, the, press, and, also, maintained, friendly, relations, with, refuseniks, who, later, made, aliyah, in, may, 1968, sakharov, completed, an, essay, reflections, on, progress, peaceful, coexistence, and, intellectual, freedom, he, described, the, anti, ballistic, missile, defense, as, a, major, threat, of, world, nuclear, war, after, the, essay, was, circulated, in, samizdat, and, then, published, outside, the, soviet, union, sakharov, was, banned, from, conducting, any, military, related, research, and, returned, to, fian, to, study, fundamental, theoretical, physics, for, 12, years, until, his, exile, to, gorky, nizhny, novgorod, in, january, 1980, sakharov, assumed, the, role, of, a, widely, recognized, and, open, dissident, in, moscow, 21, he, stood, vigil, outside, closed, courtrooms, wrote, appeals, on, behalf, of, more, than, 200, individual, prisoners, and, continued, to, write, essays, about, the, need, for, democratization, 21, in, 1970, sakharov, was, among, the, three, founding, members, of, the, committee, on, human, rights, in, the, ussr, along, with, valery, chalidze, and, andrei, tverdokhlebov, 21, the, committee, wrote, appeals, collected, signatures, for, petitions, and, succeeded, in, affiliating, with, several, international, human, rights, organizations, its, work, was, the, subject, of, many, kgb, reports, and, brought, sakharov, under, increasing, pressure, from, the, government, sakharov, married, a, fellow, human, rights, activist, yelena, bonner, in, 1972, by, 1973, sakharov, was, meeting, regularly, with, western, correspondents, and, holding, press, conferences, in, his, apartment, 21, he, appealed, to, the, us, congress, to, approve, the, 1974, jackson, vanik, amendment, to, a, trade, bill, which, coupled, trade, tariffs, to, the, kremlin, s, willingness, to, allow, freer, emigration, for, soviet, jews, 24, in, 1972, sakharov, became, the, target, of, sustained, pressure, from, his, fellow, scientists, in, the, soviet, academy, of, sciences, and, the, soviet, press, the, writer, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, came, to, his, defence, in, 1973, and, 1974, the, soviet, media, campaign, continued, targeting, both, sakharov, and, solzhenitsyn, for, their, pro, western, anti, socialist, positions, sakharov, later, described, that, it, took, years, for, him, to, understand, how, much, substitution, deceit, and, lack, of, correspondence, with, reality, there, was, in, the, soviet, ideals, at, first, i, thought, despite, everything, that, i, saw, with, my, own, eyes, that, the, soviet, state, was, a, breakthrough, into, the, future, a, kind, of, prototype, for, all, countries, then, he, came, in, his, words, to, the, theory, of, symmetry, all, governments, and, regimes, to, a, first, approximation, are, bad, all, peoples, are, oppressed, and, all, are, threatened, by, common, dangers, symmetry, between, a, cancer, cell, and, a, normal, one, yet, our, state, is, similar, to, a, cancer, cell, with, its, messianism, and, expansionism, its, totalitarian, suppression, of, dissent, the, authoritarian, structure, of, power, with, a, total, absence, of, public, control, in, the, most, important, decisions, in, domestic, and, foreign, policy, a, closed, society, that, does, not, inform, its, citizens, of, anything, substantial, closed, to, the, outside, world, without, freedom, of, travel, or, the, exchange, of, information, sakharov, s, ideas, on, social, development, led, him, to, put, forward, the, principle, of, human, rights, as, a, new, basis, of, all, politics, in, his, works, he, declared, that, the, principle, what, is, not, prohibited, is, allowed, should, be, understood, literally, and, defied, what, he, saw, as, unwritten, ideological, rules, imposed, by, the, communist, party, on, the, society, in, spite, of, a, democratic, soviet, constitution, 1936, i, am, no, volunteer, priest, of, the, idea, but, simply, a, man, with, an, unusual, fate, i, am, against, all, kinds, of, self, immolation, for, myself, and, for, others, including, the, people, closest, to, me, in, a, letter, written, from, exile, he, cheered, up, a, fellow, physicist, and, free, market, advocate, with, the, words, fortunately, the, future, is, unpredictable, and, also, because, of, quantum, effects, uncertain, for, sakharov, the, indeterminacy, of, the, future, supported, his, belief, that, he, could, and, should, take, personal, responsibility, for, it, in, 1973, sakharov, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, peace, prize, and, in, 1974, he, was, awarded, the, prix, mondial, cino, del, duca, sakharov, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1975, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, called, him, a, spokesman, for, the, conscience, of, mankind, in, the, words, of, the, nobel, committee, s, citation, in, a, convincing, manner, sakharov, has, emphasised, that, man, s, inviolable, rights, provide, the, only, safe, foundation, for, genuine, and, enduring, international, cooperation, sakharov, was, not, allowed, to, leave, the, soviet, union, to, collect, the, prize, his, wife, yelena, bonner, read, his, speech, at, the, ceremony, in, oslo, norway, on, the, day, the, prize, was, awarded, sakharov, was, in, vilnius, where, the, human, rights, activist, sergei, kovalev, was, being, tried, in, his, nobel, lecture, peace, progress, human, rights, sakharov, called, for, an, end, to, the, arms, race, greater, respect, for, the, environment, international, cooperation, and, universal, respect, for, human, rights, he, included, a, list, of, prisoners, of, conscience, and, political, prisoners, in, the, soviet, union, and, stated, that, he, shared, the, prize, with, them, by, 1976, the, head, of, the, kgb, yuri, andropov, was, prepared, to, call, sakharov, domestic, enemy, number, one, before, a, group, of, kgb, officers, 24, sakharov, was, arrested, on, 22, january, 1980, following, his, public, protests, against, the, soviet, intervention, in, afghanistan, in, 1979, and, was, sent, to, the, city, of, gorky, now, nizhny, novgorod, a, city, that, was, off, limits, to, foreigners, between, 1980, and, 1986, sakharov, was, kept, under, soviet, police, surveillance, in, his, memoirs, he, mentioned, that, their, apartment, in, gorky, was, repeatedly, subjected, to, searches, and, heists, sakharov, was, named, the, 1980, humanist, of, the, year, by, the, american, humanist, association, in, may, 1984, sakharov, s, wife, yelena, bonner, was, detained, and, sakharov, began, a, hunger, strike, demanding, permission, for, his, wife, to, travel, to, the, united, states, for, heart, surgery, he, was, forcibly, hospitalized, and, force, fed, he, was, held, in, isolation, for, four, months, in, august, 1984, bonner, was, sentenced, by, a, court, to, five, years, of, exile, in, gorky, in, april, 1985, sakharov, started, a, new, hunger, strike, for, his, wife, to, travel, abroad, for, medical, treatment, he, again, was, taken, to, a, hospital, and, force, fed, in, august, the, politburo, discussed, what, to, do, about, sakharov, he, remained, in, the, hospital, until, october, 1985, when, his, wife, was, allowed, to, travel, to, the, united, states, she, had, heart, surgery, in, the, united, states, and, returned, to, gorky, in, june, 1986, in, december, 1985, the, european, parliament, established, the, sakharov, prize, for, freedom, of, thought, to, be, given, annually, for, outstanding, contributions, to, human, rights, on, 19, december, 1986, mikhail, gorbachev, who, had, initiated, the, policies, of, perestroika, and, glasnost, called, sakharov, to, tell, him, that, he, and, his, wife, could, return, to, moscow, in, 1988, sakharov, was, given, the, international, humanist, award, by, the, international, humanist, and, ethical, union, he, helped, to, initiate, the, first, independent, legal, political, organizations, and, became, prominent, in, the, soviet, union, s, growing, political, opposition, in, march, 1989, sakharov, was, elected, to, the, new, parliament, the, all, union, congress, of, people, s, deputies, and, co, led, the, democratic, opposition, the, inter, regional, deputies, group, in, november, the, head, of, the, kgb, reported, to, gorbachev, on, sakharov, s, encouragement, and, support, for, the, coal, miners, strike, in, vorkuta, in, december, 1988, sakharov, visited, armenia, and, azerbaijan, on, a, fact, finding, mission, he, concluded, for, azerbaijan, the, issue, of, karabakh, is, a, matter, of, ambition, for, the, armenians, of, karabakh, it, is, a, matter, of, life, and, death, soon, after, 9, p, m, on, 14, december, 1989, sakharov, went, to, his, study, to, take, a, nap, before, preparing, an, important, speech, he, was, to, deliver, the, next, day, in, the, congress, his, wife, went, to, wake, him, at, 11, p, m, as, he, had, requested, but, she, found, sakharov, dead, on, the, floor, according, to, the, notes, of, yakov, rapoport, a, senior, pathologist, present, at, the, autopsy, it, is, most, likely, that, sakharov, died, of, an, arrhythmia, consequent, to, dilated, cardiomyopathy, at, the, age, of, 68, he, was, interred, in, the, vostryakovskoye, cemetery, in, moscow, the, sakharov, prize, for, freedom, of, thought, was, established, in, 1988, by, the, european, parliament, in, his, honour, and, is, the, highest, tribute, to, human, rights, endeavours, awarded, by, the, european, union, it, is, awarded, annually, by, the, parliament, to, those, who, carry, the, spirit, of, soviet, dissident, andrei, sakharov, to, laureates, who, like, sakharov, dedicate, their, lives, to, peaceful, struggle, for, human, rights, an, andrei, sakharov, prize, has, also, been, awarded, by, the, american, physical, society, every, second, year, since, 2006, to, recognize, outstanding, leadership, and, or, achievements, of, scientists, in, upholding, human, rights, the, andrei, sakharov, prize, for, writer, s, civic, courage, was, established, in, october, 1990, in, 2004, with, the, approval, of, yelena, bonner, an, annual, sakharov, prize, for, journalism, was, established, for, reporters, and, commentators, in, russia,
