play, golf, in, palm, beach, florida, after, which, graham, acknowledged, kennedy, s, election, as, an, opportunity, for, catholics, and, protestants, to, come, closer, together, after, they, had, discussed, jesus, christ, at, that, meeting, the, two, remained, in, touch, meeting, for, the, last, time, at, a, national, day, of, prayer, meeting, in, february, 1963, in, his, autobiography,

large, majority, of, abortions, but, supported, it, as, a, legal, option, in, a, very, narrow, range, of, circumstances, rape, incest, and, the, life, of, the, mother, the, billy, graham, evangelistic, association, states, that, life, is, sacred, and, we, must, seek, to, protect, all, human, life, the, unborn, the, child, the, adult, and, the, aged, graham, leaned, toward, the, republicans, during, the, presidency, of, richard, nixon, whom, he, had, met, and, befriended, as, vice, president, under, dwight, d, eisenhower, he, did, not, completely, ally, himself, with, the, later, religious, right, saying, that, jesus, did, not, have, a, political, party, he, gave, his, support, to, various, political, candidates, over, the, years, in, 2007, graham, explained, his, refusal, to, join, jerry, falwell, s, moral, majority, in, 1979, saying, i, m, for, morality, but, morality, goes, beyond, sex, to, human, freedom, and, social, justice, we, as, clergy, know, so, very, little, to, speak, with, authority, on, the, panama, canal, or, superiority, of, armaments, evangelists, cannot, be, closely, identified, with, any, particular, party, or, person, we, have, to, stand, in, the, middle, to, preach, to, all, people, right, and, left, i, haven, t, been, faithful, to, my, own, advice, in, the, past, i, will, be, in, the, future, according, to, a, 2006, newsweek, interview, for, graham, politics, is, a, secondary, to, the, gospel, when, newsweek, asked, graham, whether, ministers, whether, they, think, of, themselves, as, evangelists, pastors, or, a, bit, of, both, should, spend, time, engaged, with, politics, he, replied, you, know, i, think, in, a, way, that, has, to, be, up, to, the, individual, as, he, feels, led, of, the, lord, a, lot, of, things, that, i, commented, on, years, ago, would, not, have, been, of, the, lord, i, m, sure, but, i, think, you, have, some, like, communism, or, segregation, on, which, i, think, you, have, a, responsibility, to, speak, out, in, 2011, although, grateful, to, have, met, politicians, who, have, spiritual, needs, like, everyone, else, he, said, he, sometimes, crossed, the, line, and, would, have, preferred, to, avoid, politics, in, 2012, graham, endorsed, the, republican, presidential, candidate, mitt, romney, shortly, after, apparently, to, accommodate, romney, who, is, a, mormon, references, to, mormonism, as, a, religious, cult, a, cult, is, any, group, which, teaches, doctrines, or, beliefs, that, deviate, from, the, biblical, message, of, the, christian, faith, were, removed, from, graham, s, website, observers, have, questioned, whether, the, support, of, republican, and, religious, right, politics, on, issues, such, as, same, sex, marriage, coming, from, graham, who, stopped, speaking, in, public, or, to, reporters, in, fact, reflects, the, views, of, his, son, franklin, head, of, the, bgea, franklin, denied, this, and, said, that, he, would, continue, to, act, as, his, father, s, spokesperson, rather, than, allowing, press, conferences, in, 2016, according, to, his, son, franklin, graham, voted, for, donald, trump, this, statement, has, been, disputed, by, other, children, and, grandchildren, of, billy, graham, who, argue, that, he, was, too, ill, to, vote, even, absentee, and, who, reiterated, that, billy, graham, s, stated, greatest, regret, in, life, was, becoming, involved, in, partisan, politics, graham, had, a, personal, audience, with, many, sitting, us, presidents, from, harry, s, truman, to, barack, obama, 12, consecutive, presidents, after, meeting, with, truman, in, 1950, graham, told, the, press, he, had, urged, the, president, to, counter, communism, in, north, korea, truman, disliked, him, and, did, not, speak, with, him, for, years, after, that, meeting, later, he, always, treated, his, conversations, with, presidents, as, confidential, truman, made, his, contempt, for, graham, public, he, wrote, about, graham, in, his, 1974, autobiography, plain, speaking, but, now, we, ve, got, just, this, one, evangelist, this, billy, graham, and, he, s, gone, off, the, beam, he, s, well, i, hadn, t, ought, to, say, this, but, he, s, one, of, those, counterfeits, i, was, telling, you, about, he, claims, he, s, a, friend, of, all, the, presidents, but, he, was, never, a, friend, of, mine, when, i, was, president, i, just, don, t, go, for, people, like, that, all, he, s, interested, in, is, getting, his, name, in, the, paper, graham, became, a, regular, visitor, during, the, tenure, of, dwight, d, eisenhower, he, purportedly, urged, him, to, intervene, with, federal, troops, in, the, case, of, the, little, rock, nine, to, gain, admission, of, black, students, to, public, schools, house, speaker, sam, rayburn, persuaded, congress, to, allow, graham, to, conduct, the, first, religious, service, on, the, steps, of, the, capitol, building, in, 1952, eisenhower, asked, for, graham, while, on, his, deathbed, graham, met, and, became, a, close, friend, of, vice, president, richard, nixon, and, supported, nixon, a, quaker, for, the, 1960, presidential, election, he, convened, an, august, strategy, session, of, evangelical, leaders, in, montreux, switzerland, to, plan, how, best, to, oppose, nixon, s, roman, catholic, opponent, senator, john, f, kennedy, though, a, registered, democrat, graham, also, maintained, firm, support, of, aggression, against, the, foreign, threat, of, communism, and, strongly, sympathized, with, nixon, s, views, regarding, american, foreign, policy, thus, he, was, more, sympathetic, to, republican, administrations, on, december, 16, 1963, u, s, president, lyndon, b, johnson, who, was, impressed, by, the, way, graham, had, praised, the, work, of, his, great, grandfather, george, washington, baines, invited, graham, to, the, white, house, to, receive, spiritual, counseling, after, this, visit, johnson, frequently, called, on, graham, for, more, spiritual, counseling, as, well, as, companionship, as, graham, recalled, to, his, biographer, frady, i, almost, used, the, white, house, as, a, hotel, when, johnson, was, president, he, was, always, trying, to, keep, me, there, he, just, never, wanted, me, to, leave, in, contrast, with, his, more, limited, access, with, truman, eisenhower, and, kennedy, graham, would, not, only, visit, the, white, house, private, quarters, but, would, also, at, times, kneel, at, johnson, s, bedside, and, pray, with, him, whenever, the, president, requested, him, to, do, so, graham, once, recalled, i, have, never, had, many, people, do, that, in, addition, to, his, white, house, visits, graham, visited, johnson, at, camp, david, and, occasionally, met, with, the, president, when, he, retreated, to, his, private, ranch, in, stonewall, texas, johnson, was, also, the, first, sitting, president, to, attend, one, of, graham, s, crusades, in, houston, texas, in, 1965, during, the, 1964, united, states, presidential, election, supporters, of, republican, nominee, barry, goldwater, sent, an, estimated, 2, million, telegrams, to, graham, s, hometown, of, montreat, north, carolina, and, sought, the, preacher, s, endorsement, supportive, of, johnson, s, domestic, policies, and, hoping, to, preserve, his, friendship, with, the, president, graham, resisted, pressure, to, endorse, goldwater, and, stayed, neutral, in, the, election, following, johnson, s, election, victory, graham, s, role, as, the, main, white, house, pastor, was, solidified, at, one, point, johnson, even, considered, making, graham, a, member, of, his, cabinet, and, grooming, him, to, be, his, successor, though, graham, insisted, he, had, no, political, ambitions, and, wished, to, remain, a, preacher, graham, s, biographer, david, aikman, acknowledged, that, the, preacher, was, closer, to, johnson, than, any, other, president, he, had, ever, known, he, spent, the, last, night, of, johnson, s, presidency, in, the, white, house, and, he, stayed, for, the, first, night, of, nixon, s, after, nixon, s, victorious, 1968, presidential, campaign, graham, became, an, adviser, regularly, visiting, the, white, house, and, leading, the, president, s, private, worship, services, in, a, meeting, they, had, with, golda, meir, nixon, offered, graham, the, ambassadorship, to, israel, but, he, declined, the, offer, in, 1970, nixon, appeared, at, a, graham, revival, in, east, tennessee, which, they, thought, safe, politically, it, drew, one, of, the, largest, crowds, in, tennessee, of, protesters, against, the, vietnam, war, nixon, was, the, first, president, to, give, a, speech, from, an, evangelist, s, platform, their, friendship, became, strained, in, 1973, when, graham, rebuked, nixon, for, his, post, watergate, behavior, and, the, profanity, heard, on, the, watergate, tapes, they, eventually, reconciled, after, nixon, s, resignation, graham, officiated, at, one, presidential, burial, and, one, presidential, funeral, he, presided, over, the, graveside, services, of, president, lyndon, b, johnson, in, 1973, and, took, part, in, eulogizing, the, former, president, graham, officiated, at, the, funeral, services, of, former, first, lady, pat, nixon, in, 1993, and, the, death, and, state, funeral, of, richard, nixon, in, 1994, during, the, monica, lewinsky, scandal, graham, asserted, that, he, believed, president, bill, clinton, to, be, a, spiritual, person, he, was, unable, to, attend, the, state, funeral, of, ronald, reagan, on, june, 11, 2004, as, he, was, recovering, from, hip, replacement, surgery, this, was, mentioned, by, george, w, bush, in, his, eulogy, on, april, 25, 2010, president, barack, obama, visited, graham, at, his, home, in, montreat, north, carolina, where, they, had, a, private, prayer, graham, had, a, friendly, relationship, with, queen, elizabeth, ii, and, was, frequently, invited, by, the, royal, family, to, special, events, they, first, met, in, 1955, and, graham, preached, at, windsor, chapel, at, the, queen, s, invitation, during, the, following, year, their, friendly, relationship, may, have, been, because, they, shared, a, traditional, approach, to, the, practical, aspects, of, the, christian, faith, graham, was, outspoken, against, communism, and, supported, the, american, cold, war, policy, including, the, vietnam, war, in, a, secret, letter, from, april, 15, 1969, made, public, twenty, years, later, graham, encouraged, nixon, to, bomb, the, dikes, in, north, vietnam, if, the, peace, talks, in, paris, should, fail, this, action, would, destroy, the, economy, of, north, vietnam, and, by, nixon, s, estimate, would, have, killed, a, million, people, in, 1982, graham, preached, in, the, soviet, union, and, attended, a, wreath, laying, ceremony, to, honor, the, war, dead, of, world, war, ii, when, the, soviets, were, american, allies, in, the, fight, against, nazism, he, voiced, fear, of, a, second, holocaust, not, against, jews, but, a, nuclear, holocaust, and, advised, that, our, greatest, contribution, to, world, peace, is, to, live, with, christ, every, day, in, a, 1999, speech, graham, discussed, his, relationship, with, the, late, north, korean, leader, kim, il, sung, praising, him, as, a, different, kind, of, communist, and, one, of, the, great, fighters, for, freedom, in, his, country, against, the, japanese, graham, went, on, to, note, that, although, he, had, never, met, kim, s, son, and, then, current, north, korean, leader, kim, jong, il, he, had, exchanged, gifts, with, him, during, the, watergate, affair, there, were, suggestions, that, graham, had, expressed, antisemitic, opinions, in, private, discussions, with, richard, nixon, he, denied, this, stressing, his, efforts, to, build, bridges, to, the, jewish, community, in, 2002, the, controversy, was, renewed, when, declassified, richard, nixon, tapes, confirmed, remarks, made, by, graham, to, nixon, three, decades, earlier, captured, on, the, tapes, graham, agreed, with, nixon, that, jews, control, the, american, media, calling, it, a, stranglehold, during, a, 1972, conversation, with, nixon, and, suggesting, that, if, nixon, was, re, elected, that, they, might, be, able, to, do, something, about, it, when, the, tapes, were, made, public, graham, apologized, and, said, although, i, have, no, memory, of, the, occasion, i, deeply, regret, comments, i, apparently, made, in, an, oval, office, conversation, with, president, nixon, some, 30, years, ago, they, do, not, reflect, my, views, and, i, sincerely, apologize, for, any, offense, caused, by, the, remarks, according, to, newsweek, magazine, he, shock, of, the, revelation, was, magnified, because, of, graham, s, longtime, support, of, israel, and, his, refusal, to, join, in, calls, for, conversion, of, the, jews, in, 2009, more, nixon, tapes, were, released, in, which, graham, is, heard, in, a, 1973, conversation, with, nixon, referring, to, a, group, of, jewish, journalists, as, the, synagogue, of, satan, a, spokesman, for, graham, said, that, graham, has, never, been, an, antisemite, and, that, the, comparison, in, accord, with, the, context, of, the, quotation, in, the, book, of, revelation, was, directed, specifically, at, those, claiming, to, be, jews, but, not, holding, to, traditional, jewish, values, after, a, 1957, crusade, in, new, york, some, more, fundamentalist, protestant, christians, criticized, graham, for, his, ecumenism, even, calling, him, antichrist, graham, expressed, inclusivist, views, suggesting, that, people, without, explicit, faith, in, jesus, can, be, saved, in, a, 1997, interview, with, robert, schuller, graham, said, i, think, that, everybody, that, loves, or, knows, christ, whether, they, are, conscious, of, it, or, not, they, are, members, of, the, body, of, christ, is, calling, people, out, of, the, world, for, his, name, whether, they, come, from, the, muslim, world, or, the, buddhist, world, or, the, non, believing, world, they, are, members, of, the, body, of, christ, because, they, have, been, called, by, god, they, may, not, know, the, name, of, jesus, but, they, know, in, their, hearts, that, they, need, something, they, do, not, have, and, they, turn, to, the, only, light, they, have, and, i, think, that, they, are, saved, and, they, are, going, to, be, with, us, in, heaven, iain, murray, writing, from, a, conservative, protestant, standpoint, argues, that, graham, s, concessions, are, sad, words, from, one, who, once, spoke, on, the, basis, of, biblical, certainties, in, 1970, graham, stated, that, feminism, was, an, echo, of, our, overall, philosophy, of, permissiveness, and, that, women, did, not, want, to, be, competitive, juggernauts, pitted, against, male, chauvinists, he, further, stated, that, the, role, of, wife, mother, and, homemaker, was, the, destiny, of, real, womanhood, according, to, the, judeo, christian, ethic, graham, s, assertions, published, in, the, ladies, home, journal, elicited, letters, of, protest, and, were, offered, as, rebuttal, to, the, establishment, of, the, new, feminism, section, of, the, publication, that, had, added, following, a, sit, in, protest, at, the, journal, offices, demanding, female, representation, on, the, staff, of, the, publication, graham, s, daughter, bunny, recounted, her, father, denying, her, and, her, sisters, higher, education, as, reported, in, the, washington, post, bunny, remembers, being, groomed, for, the, life, of, wife, homemaker, and, mother, there, was, never, an, idea, of, a, career, for, us, she, said, i, wanted, to, go, to, nursing, school, wheaton, had, a, five, year, program, but, daddy, said, no, no, reason, no, explanation, just, no, it, wasn, t, confrontational, and, he, wasn, t, angry, but, when, he, decided, that, was, the, end, of, it, she, added, he, has, forgotten, that, mother, has, not, graham, s, daughter, anne, is, a, christian, minister, leading, a, christian, ministry, organization, known, as, angel, ministries, graham, talked, his, future, wife, ruth, into, abandoning, her, ambition, to, evangelize, in, tibet, in, favor, of, staying, in, the, united, states, to, marry, him, and, that, to, do, otherwise, would, be, to, thwart, god, s, obvious, will, after, ruth, agreed, to, marry, him, graham, cited, the, bible, for, claiming, authority, over, her, saying, then, i, ll, do, the, leading, and, you, do, the, following, according, to, her, obituary, ruth, was, active, in, christian, ministry, after, they, married, often, teaching, sunday, school, her, obituary, states, that, in, addition, to, his, two, sons, all, three, of, graham, s, daughters, would, become, christian, ministers, as, well, graham, regarded, homosexuality, as, a, sin, and, in, 1974, described, it, as, a, sinister, form, of, perversion, in, 1993, he, said, that, he, thought, aids, might, be, a, judgment, from, god, but, two, weeks, later, he, retracted, the, remark, saying, i, don, t, believe, that, and, i, don, t, know, why, i, said, it, graham, opposed, same, sex, marriage, stating, that, i, believe, the, home, and, marriage, is, the, foundation, of, our, society, and, must, be, protected, graham, s, obituary, noted, that, his, stated, position, was, that, he, did, not, want, to, talk, about, homosexuality, as, a, political, issue, corky, siemaszko, writing, for, nbc, news, noted, that, after, the, 1993, incident, graham, largely, steered, clear, of, the, subject, however, graham, appeared, to, take, a, more, tolerant, approach, to, the, issue, of, homosexuality, when, he, appeared, on, the, may, 2, 1997, episode, of, 20, 20, stating, i, think, that, the, bible, teaches, that, homosexuality, is, a, sin, but, the, bible, also, teaches, that, pride, is, a, sin, jealously, is, a, sin, and, hate, is, a, sin, evil, thoughts, are, a, sin, and, so, i, don, t, think, that, homosexuality, should, be, chosen, as, the, overwhelming, sin, that, we, are, doing, today, in, 2012, graham, and, his, son, franklin, publicly, endorsed, north, carolina, amendment, 1, a, measure, to, ban, same, sex, marriage,
