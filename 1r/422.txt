them, politically, and, predicted, great, things, for, him, as, a, poet, southey, also, informed, shelley, that, william, godwin, author, of, political, justice, which, had, greatly, influenced, him, in, his, youth, and, which, shelley, also, admired, was, still, alive, shelley, wrote, to, godwin, offering, himself, as, his, devoted, disciple, godwin, who, had, modified, many, of, his, earlier, radical, views, advised, shelley, to, reconcile, with, his, father, become, a, scholar, before, he, published, anything, else, and, give, up, his, avowed, plans, for, political, agitation, in,

from, their, landlord, and, neighbours, who, were, alarmed, by, shelley, s, scientific, experiments, pistol, shooting, and, radical, political, views, as, tension, mounted, shelley, claimed, he, had,

of, the, risk, of, prosecution, for, seditious, and, religious, libel, in, february, 1813, shelley, claimed, he, was, attacked, in, his, home, at, night, the, incident, might, have, been, real, a, hallucination, brought, on, by, stress, or, a, hoax, staged, by, shelley, in, order, to, escape, government, surveillance, creditors, and, his, entanglements, in, local, politics, the, shelleys, and,

their, edinburgh, wedding, and, secure, the, rights, of, their, child, nevertheless, the, shelleys, lived, apart, for, most, of, the, following, months, and, shelley, reflected, bitterly, on, my, rash, heartless, union, with, harriet, in, may, 1814, shelley, began, visiting, his, mentor, godwin, almost, daily, and, soon, fell, in, love, with, mary, the, sixteen, year, old, daughter, of, godwin, and, the, late, feminist, author, mary, wollstonecraft, shelley, and, mary, declared, their, love, for, each, other, during, a, visit, to, her, mother, s, grave, in, the, churchyard, of, st, pancras, old, church, on, 26, june, when, shelley, told, godwin, that, he, intended, to, leave, harriet, and, live, with, mary, his, mentor, banished, him, from, the, house, and, forbade, mary, from, seeing, him, shelley, and, mary, eloped, to, europe, on, 28, july, taking, mary, s, step, sister, claire, clairmont, with, them, before, leaving, shelley, had, secured, a, loan, of, 3, 000, but, had, left, most, of, the, funds, at, the, disposal, of, godwin, and, harriet, who, was, again, pregnant, the, financial, arrangement, with, godwin, led, to, rumours, that, he, had, sold, his, daughters, to, shelley, shelley, mary, and, claire, made, their, way, across, war, ravaged, france, where, shelley, wrote, to, harriet, asking, her, to, meet, them, in, switzerland, with, the, money, he, had, left, for, her, hearing, nothing, from, harriet, in, switzerland, and, unable, to, secure, sufficient, funds, or, suitable, accommodation, the, three, travelled, to, germany, and, holland, before, returning, to, england, on, 13, september, shelley, spent, the, next, few, months, trying, to, raise, loans, and, avoid, bailiffs, mary, was, pregnant, lonely, depressed, and, ill, her, mood, was, not, improved, when, she, heard, that, on, 30, november, harriet, had, given, birth, to, charles, bysshe, shelley, heir, to, the, shelley, fortune, and, baronetcy, this, was, followed, in, early, january, 1815, by, news, that, shelley, s, grandfather, sir, bysshe, had, died, leaving, an, estate, worth, 220, 000, the, settlement, of, the, estate, and, a, financial, settlement, between, shelley, and, his, father, now, sir, timothy, however, was, not, concluded, until, april, the, following, year, in, february, 1815, mary, gave, premature, birth, to, a, baby, girl, who, died, ten, days, later, deepening, her, depression, in, the, following, weeks, mary, became, close, to, hogg, who, temporarily, moved, into, the, household, shelley, was, almost, certainly, having, a, sexual, relationship, with, claire, at, this, time, and, it, is, possible, that, mary, with, shelley, s, encouragement, was, also, having, a, sexual, relationship, with, hogg, in, may, claire, left, the, household, at, mary, s, insistence, to, reside, in, lynmouth, in, august, shelley, and, mary, moved, to, bishopsgate, where, shelley, worked, on, alastor, a, long, poem, in, blank, verse, based, on, the, myth, of,

him, queen, mab, and, other, poems, shelley, s, party, arrived, in, geneva, in, may, and, rented, a, house, close, to, villa, diodati, on, the, shores, of, lake, geneva, where, byron, was, staying, there, shelley, byron, and, the, others, engaged, in, discussions, about, literature, science, and, various, philosophical, doctrines, one, night, while, byron, was, reciting, coleridge, s, christabel, shelley, suffered, a, severe, panic, attack, with, hallucinations, the, previous, night, mary, had, had, a, more, productive, vision, or, nightmare, which, inspired, her, novel, frankenstein, shelley, and, byron, then, took, a, boating, tour, around, lake, geneva, which, inspired, shelley, to, write, his, hymn, to, intellectual, beauty, his, first, substantial, poem, since, alastor, a, tour, of, chamonix, in, the, french, alps, inspired, mont, blanc, which, has, been, described, as, an, atheistic, response, to, coleridge, s, hymn, before, sunrise, in, the, vale, of, chamoni, during, this, tour, shelley, often, signed, guest, books, with, a, declaration, that, he, was, an, atheist, these, declarations, were, seen, by, other, british, tourists, including, southey, which, hardened, attitudes, against, shelley, back, home, relations, between, byron, and, shelley, s, party, became, strained, when, byron, was, told, that, claire, was, pregnant, with, his, child, shelley, mary, and, claire, left, switzerland, in, late, august, with, arrangements, for, the, expected, baby, still, unclear, although, shelley, made, provision, for, claire, and, the, baby, in, his, will, in, january, 1817, claire, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, by, byron, who, she, named, alba, but, later, renamed, allegra, in, accordance, with, byron, s, wishes, ozymandias, i, met, a, traveller, from, an, antique, land, who, said, two, vast, and, trunkless, legs, of, stone, stand, in, the, desart, near, them, on, the, sand, half, sunk, a, shattered, visage, lies, whose, frown, and, wrinkled, lip, and, sneer, of, cold, command, tell, that, its, sculptor, well, those, passions, read, which, yet, survive, stamped, on, these, lifeless, things, the, hand, that, mocked, them, and, the, heart, that, fed, and, on, the, pedestal, these, words, appear, my, name, is, ozymandias, king, of, kings, look, on, my, works, ye, mighty, and, despair, nothing, beside, remains, round, the, decay, of, that, colossal, wreck, boundless, and, bare, the, lone, and, level, sands, stretch, far, away, percy, bysshe, shelley, 1818, shelley, and, mary, returned, to, england, in, september, 1816, and, in,

variously, speculated, that, she, was, adopted, by, shelley, to, console, mary, for, the, loss, of, clara, that, she, was, shelley, s, child, by, claire, that, she, was, his, child, by, his, servant,

were, now, living, in, livorno, where, in, september, shelley, heard, of, the, peterloo, massacre, of, peaceful, protesters, in, manchester, within, two, weeks, he, had, completed, one, of, his, most, famous, political, poems, the, mask, of, anarchy, and, despatched, it, to, leigh, hunt, for, publication, hunt, however, decided, not, to, publish, it, for, fear, of, prosecution, for, seditious, libel, the, poem, was, only, officially, published, in, 1832, the, shelleys, moved, to, florence, in, october, where, shelley, read, a, scathing, review, of, the, revolt, of, islam, and, its, earlier, version, laon, and, cythna, in, the, conservative, quarterly, review, shelley, was, angered, by, the, personal, attack, on, him, in, the, article, which, he, erroneously, believed, had, been, written, by, southey, his, bitterness, over, the, review, lasted, for, the, rest, of, his, life, on, 12, november, mary, gave, birth, to, a, boy, percy, florence, shelley, around, the, time, of, percy, s, birth, the, shelleys, met, sophia, stacey, who, was, a, ward, of, one, of, shelley, s, uncles, and, was, staying, at, the, same, pension, as, the, shelleys, sophia, a, talented, harpist, and, singer, formed, a, friendship, with, shelley, while, mary, was, preoccupied, with, her, newborn, son, shelley, wrote, at, least, five, love, poems, and, fragments, for, sophia, including, song, written, for, an, indian, air, the, shelleys, moved, to, pisa, in, january, 1820, ostensibly, to, consult, a, doctor, who, had, been, recommended, to, them, there, they, became, friends, with, the, irish, republican, margaret, mason, lady, margaret, mountcashell, and, her, common, law, husband, george, william, tighe, mrs, mason, became, the, inspiration, for, shelley, s, poem, the, sensitive, plant, and, shelley, s, discussions, with, mason, and, tighe, influenced, his, political, thought, and, his, critical, interest, in, the, population, theories, of, thomas, malthus, in, march, shelley, wrote, to, friends, that, mary, was, depressed, suicidal, and, hostile, towards, him, shelley, was, also, beset, by, financial, worries, as, creditors, from, england, pressed, him, for, payment, and, he, was, obliged, to, make, secret, payments, in, connection, with, his, neapolitan, charge, elena, meanwhile, shelley, was, writing, a, philosophical, view, of, reform, a, political, essay, which, he, had, begun, in, rome, the, unfinished, essay, which, remained, unpublished, in, shelley, s, lifetime, has, been, called, one, of, the, most, advanced, and, sophisticated, documents, of, political, philosophy, in, the, nineteenth, century, another, crisis, erupted, in, june, when, shelley, claimed, that, he, had, been, assaulted, in, the, pisan, post, office, by, a, man, accusing, him, of, foul, crimes, shelley, s, biographer, james, bieri, suggests, that, this, incident, was, possibly, a, delusional, episode, brought, on, by, extreme, stress, as, shelley, was, being, blackmailed, by, a, former, servant, paolo, foggi, over, baby, elena, it, is, likely, that, the, blackmail, was, connected, with, a, story, spread, by, another, former, servant, elise, foggi, that, shelley, had, fathered, a, child, to, claire, in, naples, and, had, sent, it, to, a, foundling, home, shelley, claire, and, mary, denied, this, story, and, elise, later, recanted, in, july, hearing, that, john, keats, was, seriously, ill, in, england, shelley, wrote, to, the, poet, inviting, him, to, stay, with, him, at, pisa, keats, replied, with, hopes, of, seeing, him, but, instead, arrangements, were, made, for, keats, to, travel, to, rome, following, the, death, of, keats, in, 1821, shelley, wrote, adonais, which, harold, bloom, considers, one, of, the, major, pastoral, elegies, the, poem, was, published, in, pisa, in, july, 1821, but, sold, few, copies, in, early, july, 1820, shelley, heard, that, baby, elena, had, died, on, 9, june, in, the, months, following, the, post, office, incident, and, elena, s, death, relations, between, mary, and, claire, deteriorated, and, claire, spent, most, of, the, next, two, years, living, separately, from, the, shelleys, mainly, in, florence, that, december, shelley, met, teresa, emilia, viviani, who, was, the, 19, year, old, daughter, of, the, governor, of, pisa, and, was, living, in, a, convent, awaiting, a, suitable, marriage, shelley, visited, her, several, times, over, the, next, few, months, and, they, started, a, passionate, correspondence, which, dwindled, after, her, marriage, the, following, september, emilia, was, the, inspiration, for, shelley, s, major, poem, epipsychidion, in, march, 1821, shelley, completed, a, defence, of, poetry, a, response, to, peacock, s, article, the, four, ages, of, poetry, shelley, s, essay, with, its, famous, conclusion, poets, are, the, unacknowledged, legislators, of, the, world, remained, unpublished, in, his, lifetime, shelley, went, alone, to, ravenna, in, early, august, to, see, byron, making, a, detour, to, livorno, for, a, rendezvous, with, claire, shelley, stayed, with, byron, for, two, weeks, and, invited, the, older, poet, to, spend, the, winter, in, pisa, after, shelley, had, heard, byron, recite, his, newly, completed, fifth, canto, of, don, juan, he, wrote, to, mary, i, despair, of, rivalling, byron, in, november, byron, moved, into, villa, lanfranchi, in, pisa, just, across, the, river, from, the, shelleys, byron, became, the, centre, of, the, pisan, circle, which, was, to, include, shelley, thomas, medwin, edward, williams, and, edward, trelawny, in, the, early, months, of, 1822, shelley, became, increasingly, close, to, jane, williams, who, was, living, with, her, partner, edward, williams, in, the, same, building, as, the, shelleys, shelley, wrote, a, number, of, love, poems, for, jane, including, the, serpent, is, shut, out, of, paradise, and, with, a, guitar, to, jane, shelley, s, obvious, affection, for, jane, was, to, cause, increasing, tension, among, shelley, edward, williams, and, mary, claire, arrived, in, pisa, in, april, at, shelley, s, invitation, and, soon, after, they, heard, that, her, daughter, allegra, had, died, of, typhus, in, ravenna, the, shelleys, and, claire, then, moved, to, villa, magni, near, lerici, on, the, shores, of, the, gulf, of, la, spezia, shelley, acted, as, mediator, between, claire, and, byron, over, arrangements, for, the, burial, of, their, daughter, and, the, added, strain, led, to, shelley, having, a, series, of, hallucinations, mary, almost, died, from, a, miscarriage, on, 16, june, her, life, only, being, saved, by, shelley, s, effective, first, aid, two, days, later, shelley, wrote, to, a, friend, that, there, was, no, sympathy, between, mary, and, him, and, if, the, past, and, future, could, be, obliterated, he, would, be, content, in, his, boat, with, jane, and, her, guitar, that, same, day, he, also, wrote, to, trelawny, asking, for, prussic, acid, the, following, week, shelley, woke, the, household, with, his, screaming, over, a, nightmare, or, hallucination, in, which, he, saw, edward, and, jane, williams, as, walking, corpses, and, himself, strangling, mary, during, this, time, shelley, was, writing, his, final, major, poem, the, unfinished, the, triumph, of, life, which, harold, bloom, has, called, the, most, despairing, poem, he, wrote, on, 1, july, 1822, shelley, and, edward, williams, sailed, in, shelley, s, new, boat, the, don, juan, to, livorno, where, shelley, met, leigh, hunt, and, byron, in, order, to, make, arrangements, for, a, new, journal, the, liberal, after, the, meeting, on, 8, july, shelley, williams, and, their, boat, boy, sailed, out, of, livorno, for, lerici, a, few, hours, later, the, don, juan, and, its, inexperienced, crew, were, lost, in, a, storm, the, vessel, an, open, boat, had, been, custom, built, in, genoa, for, shelley, mary, shelley, declared, in, her, note, on, poems, of, 1822, 1839, that, the, design, had, a, defect, and, that, the, boat, was, never, seaworthy, the, sinking, however, was, probably, due, to, the, severe, storm, and, poor, seamanship, of, the, three, men, on, board, shelley, s, badly, decomposed, body, washed, ashore, at, viareggio, ten, days, later, and, was, identified, by, trelawny, from, the, clothing, and, a, copy, of, keats, s, lamia, in, a, jacket, pocket, on, 16, august, his, body, was, cremated, on, a, beach, near, viareggio, and, the, ashes, were, buried, in, the, protestant, cemetery, of, rome, the, day, after, the, news, of, his, death, reached, england, the, tory, london, newspaper, the, courier, printed, shelley, the, writer, of, some, infidel, poetry, has, been, drowned, now, he, knows, whether, there, is, god, or, no, shelley, s, ashes, were, reburied, in, a, different, plot, at, the, cemetery, in, 1823, his, grave, bears, the, latin, inscription, cor, cordium, heart, of, hearts, and, a, few, lines, of, ariel, s, song, from, shakespeare, s, the, tempest, nothing, of, him, that, doth, fade, but, doth, suffer, a, sea, change, into, something, rich, and, strange, when, shelley, s, body, was, cremated, on, the, beach, his, presumed, heart, resisted, burning, and, was, retrieved, by, trelawny, the, heart, was, possibly, calcified, from, an, earlier, tubercular, infection, or, was, perhaps, his, liver, trelawny, gave, the, scorched, organ, to, hunt, who, preserved, it, in, spirits, of, wine, and, refused, to, hand, it, over, to, mary, he, finally, relented, and, the, heart, was, eventually, buried, either, at, st, peter, s, church, bournemouth, or, in, christchurch, priory, hunt, also, retrieved, a, piece, of, shelley, s, jawbone, which, in, 1913, was, given, to, the, shelley, keats, memorial, in, rome, shelley, s, paternal, grandfather, was, bysshe, shelley, 21, june, 1731, 6, january, 1815, who, in, 1806, became, sir, bysshe, shelley, first, baronet, of, castle, goring, on, sir, bysshe, s, death, in, 1815, shelley, s, father, inherited, the, baronetcy, becoming, sir, timothy, shelley, shelley, was, the, eldest, of, several, legitimate, children, bieri, argues, that, shelley, had, an, older, illegitimate, brother, but, if, he, existed, little, is, known, of, him, his, younger, siblings, were, john, 1806, 1866, margaret, 1801, 1887, hellen, 1799, 1885, mary, 1797, 1884, hellen, 1796, 1796, died, in, infancy, and, elizabeth, 1794, 1831, shelley, had, two, children, by, his, first, wife, harriet, eliza, ianthe, shelley, 1813, 1876, and, charles, bysshe, shelley, 1814, 1826, he, had, four, children, by, his, second, wife, mary, an, unnamed, daughter, born, in, 1815, who, only, survived, ten, days, william, shelley, 1816, 1819, clara, everina, shelley, 1817, 1818, and, sir, percy, shelley, 3rd, baronet, 1819, 1889, shelley, also, declared, himself, to, be, the, father, of, elena, adelaide, shelley, 1818, 1820, who, might, have, been, an, illegitimate, or, adopted, daughter, his, son, percy, florence, became, the, third, baronet, of, castle, goring, in, 1844, following, the, death, of, sir, timothy, shelley, shelley, was, a, political, radical, influenced, by, thinkers, such, as, rousseau, paine, godwin, wollstonecraft, and, leigh, hunt, he, advocated, catholic, emancipation, republicanism, parliamentary, reform, the, extension, of, the, franchise, freedom, of, speech, and, peaceful, assembly, an, end, to, aristocratic, and, clerical, privilege, and, a, more, equal, distribution, of, income, and, wealth, the, views, he, expressed, in, his, published, works, were, often, more, moderate, than, those, he, advocated, privately, because, of, the, risk, of, prosecution, for, seditious, libel, and, his, desire, not, to, alienate, more, moderate, friends, and, political, allies, nevertheless, his, political, writings, and, activism, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, home, office, and, he, came, under, government, surveillance, at, various, periods, shelley, s, most, influential, political, work, in, the, years, immediately, following, his, death, was, the, poem, queen, mab, which, included, extensive, notes, on, political, themes, the, work, went, through, 14, official, and, pirated, editions, by, 1845, and, became, popular, in, owenist, and, chartist, circles, his, longest, political, essay, a, philosophical, view, of, reform, was, written, in, 1820, but, not, published, until, 1920, shelley, s, advocacy, of, nonviolent, resistance, was, largely, based, on, his, reflections, on, the, french, revolution, and, rise, of, napoleon, and, his, belief, that, violent, protest, would, increase, the, prospect, of, a, military, despotism, although, shelley, sympathised, with, supporters, of, irish, independence, such, as, peter, finnerty, and, robert, emmet, he, did, not, support, violent, rebellion, in, his, early, pamphlet, an, address, to, the, irish, people, 1812, he, wrote, i, do, not, wish, to, see, things, changed, now, because, it, cannot, be, done, without, violence, and, we, may, assure, ourselves, that, none, of, us, are, fit, for, any, change, however, good, if, we, condescend, to, employ, force, in, a, cause, we, think, right, in, his, later, essay, a, philosophical, view, of, reform, shelley, did, concede, that, there, were, political, circumstances, in, which, force, might, be, justified, the, last, resort, of, resistance, is, undoubtably, insurrection, the, right, of, insurrection, is, derived, from, the, employment, of, armed, force, to, counteract, the, will, of, the, nation, shelley, supported, the, 1820, armed, rebellion, against, absolute, monarchy, in, spain, and, the, 1821, armed, greek, uprising, against, ottoman, rule, shelley, s, poem, the, mask, of, anarchy, written, in, 1819, but, first, published, in, 1832, has, been, called, perhaps, the, first, modern, statement, of, the, principle, of, nonviolent, resistance, gandhi, was, familiar, with, the, poem, and, it, is, possible, that, shelley, had, an, indirect, influence, on, gandhi, through, henry, david, thoreau, s, civil, disobedience, shelley, was, an, avowed, atheist, who, was, influenced, by, the, materialist, arguments, in, holbach, s, le, syst, me, de, la, nature, his, atheism, was, an, important, element, of, his, political, radicalism, as, he, saw, organised, religion, as, inextricably, linked, to, social, oppression, the, overt, and, implied, atheism, in, many, of, his, works, raised, a, serious, risk, of, prosecution, for, religious, libel, his, early, pamphlet, the, necessity, of, atheism, was, withdrawn, from, sale, soon, after, publication, following, a, complaint, from, a, priest, his, poem, queen, mab, which, includes, sustained, attacks, on, the, priesthood, christianity, and, religion, in, general, was, twice, prosecuted, by, the, society, for, the, suppression, of, vice, in, 1821, a, number, of, his, other, works, were, edited, before, publication, to, reduce, the, risk, of, prosecution, shelley, s, advocacy, of, free, love, drew, heavily, on, the, work, of, mary, wollstonecraft, and, the, early, work, of, william, godwin, in, his, notes, to, queen, mab, he, wrote, a, system, could, not, well, have, been, devised, more, studiously, hostile, to, human, happiness, than, marriage, he, argued, that, the, children, of, unhappy, marriages, are, nursed, in, a, systematic, school, of, ill, humour, violence, and, falsehood, he, believed, that, the, ideal, of, chastity, outside, marriage, was, a, monkish, and, evangelical, superstition, which, led, to, the, hypocrisy, of, prostitution, and, promiscuity, shelley, believed, that, sexual, connection, should, be, free, among, those, who, loved, each, other, and, last, only, as, long, as, their, mutual, love, love, should, also, be, free, and, not, subject, to, obedience, jealousy, and, fear, he, denied, that, free, love, would, lead, to, promiscuity, and, the, disruption, of, stable, human, relationships, arguing, that, relationships, based, on, love, would, generally, be, of, long, duration, and, marked, by, generosity, and, self, devotion, when, shelley, s, friend, t, j, hogg, made, an, unwanted, sexual, advance, to, shelley, s, first, wife, harriet, shelley, forgave, him, of, his, horrible, error, and, assured, him, that, he, was, not, jealous, it, is, very, likely, that, shelley, encouraged, hogg, and, shelley, s, second, wife, mary, to, have, a, sexual, relationship, shelley, converted, to, a, vegetable, diet, in, early, march, 1812, and, sustained, it, with, occasional, lapses, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, shelley, s, vegetarianism, was, influenced, by, ancient, authors, such, as, hesiod, pythagoras, socrates, plato, ovid, and, plutarch, but, more, directly, by, john, frank, newton, author, of, the, return, to, nature, or, a, defence, of, the, vegetable, regimen, 1811, shelley, wrote, two, essays, on, vegetarianism, a, vindication, of, natural, diet, 1813, and, on, the, vegetable, system, of, diet, written, circa, 1813, 1815, but, first, published, in, 1929, michael, owen, jones, argues, that, shelley, s, advocacy, of, vegetarianism, was, strikingly, modern, emphasising, its, health, benefits, the, alleviation, of, animal, suffering, the, inefficient, use, of, agricultural, land, involved, in, animal, husbandry, and, the, economic, inequality, resulting, from, the, commercialisation, of, animal, food, production, shelley, s, life, and, works, inspired, the, founding, of, the, vegetarian, society, in, england, 1847, and, directly, influenced, the, vegetarianism, of, george, bernard, shaw, shelley, s, work, was, not, widely, read, in, his, lifetime, outside, a, small, circle, of, friends, poets, and, critics, most, of, his, poetry, drama, and, fiction, was, published, in, editions, of, 250, copies, which, generally, sold, poorly, only, the, cenci, went, to, an, authorised, second, edition, while, shelley, was, alive, in, contrast, byron, s, the, corsair, 1814, sold, out, its, first, edition, of, 10, 000, copies, in, one, day, the, initial, reception, of, shelley, s, work, in, mainstream, periodicals, with, the, exception, of, the, liberal, examiner, was, generally, unfavourable, reviewers, often, launched, personal, attacks, on, shelley, s, private, life, and, political, social, and, religious, views, even, when, conceding, that, his, poetry, contained, beautiful, imagery, and, poetic, expression, there, was, also, criticism, of, shelley, s, intelligibility, and, style, hazlitt, describing, it, as, a, passionate, dream, a, straining, after, impossibilities, a, record, of, fond, conjectures, a, confused, embodying, of, vague, abstraction, shelley, s, poetry, soon, gained, a, wider, audience, in, radical, and, reformist, circles, queen, mab, became, popular, with, owenists, and, chartists, and, revolt, of, islam, influenced, poets, sympathetic, to, the, workers, movement, such, as, thomas, hood, thomas, cooper, and, william, morris, however, shelley, s, mainstream, following, did, not, develop, until, a, generation, after, his, death, bieri, argues, that, editions, of, shelley, s, poems, published, in, 1824, and, 1839, were, edited, by, mary, shelley, to, highlight, her, late, husband, s, lyrical, gifts, and, downplay, his, radical, ideas, matthew, arnold, famously, described, shelley, as, a, beautiful, and, ineffectual, angel, shelley, was, a, major, influence, on, a, number, of, important, poets, in, the, following, decades, including, robert, browning, algernon, swinburne, thomas, hardy, and, william, butler, yeats, shelley, like, characters, frequently, appeared, in, nineteenth, century, literature, they, include, scythrop, in, thomas, love, peacock, s, nightmare, abbey, ladislaw, in, george, eliot, s, middlemarch, and, angel, clare, in, hardy, s, tess, of, the, d, urbervilles, twentieth, century, critics, such, as, eliot, leavis, allen, tate, and, auden, variously,
