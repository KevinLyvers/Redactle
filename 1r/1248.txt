an, entire, people, he, had, reigned, only, eight, years, and, was, not, yet, 46, when, he, died, historian, harvey, writes, that, men, are, remembered, by, the, years, they, use, not, by, the, years, they, last, alaungpaya, was, succeeded, by, his, eldest, son, naungdawgyi, despite, his, second, son, hsinbyushin, s, attempt, to, take, over, the, throne, alaungpaya, spent, most, of, his, reign, in, the, military, campaigns, for, the, administration, of, his, newly, acquired, territories, he, largely, continued, the, policies, of, the, restored, taungoo, kings, the, most, important, aspect, of, which, was, to, reduce, the, number, of, hereditary, viceroyships, aware, that, hereditary, viceroyships, were, a, constant, cause, of, instability, the, king, appointed, governors, in, most, of, his, newly, conquered, territories, throughout, the, irrawaddy, valley, by, and, large, he, reappointed, existing, governors, if, they, submitted, to, him, without, a, fight, in, fact, most, ethnic, mon, governors, of, the, south, retained, their, position, he, appointed, only, three, viceroys, one, at, the, seven, hill, districts, present, day, magway, region, centered, around, mindon, another, at, taungoo, and, the, other, at, bago, and, none, of, them, was, hereditary, he, made, the, viceroyships, only, because, of, his, special, personal, relationships, with, those, men, the, viceroy, of, taungoo, was, his, younger, brother, for, example, after, the, death, of, the, incumbents, the, offices, automatically, became, governorships, in, accordance, with, the, taungoo, policy, he, allowed, hereditary, viceroyships, only, in, the, peripheral, regions, like, the, shan, states, and, lan, na, later, konbaung, kings, would, gradually, reduce, the, number, of, hereditary, viceroyships, even, in, the, shan, states, one, key, policy, change, that, alaungpaya, initiated, and, followed, by, latter, konbaung, kings, was, the, establishment, of, military, colonies, and, civilian, settlement, in, lower, burma, this, policy, would, prove, instrumental, in, eclipsing, the, mon, civilization, by, the, early, 19th, century, most, of, the, non, military, work, he, commissioned, came, during, a, few, brief, hiatuses, between, campaigns, in, 1752, he, designated, shwebo, as, the, capital, of, his, kingdom, and, enlarged, what, once, was, a, mid, size, village, into, a, sizable, city, he, built, a, palace, on, the, model, of, those, erected, by, the, ancient, kings, in, 1758, he, built, the, mahananda, lake, to, supply, shwebo, with, water, he, also, built, canals, by, damming, the, mu, river, for, agriculture, but, the, work, decayed, after, his, death, his, most, significant, and, enduring, work, was, the, founding, of, yangon, after, he, conquered, the, pagoda, town, of, dagon, in, 1755, he, added, settlements, with, people, from, his, home, region, the, mu, valley, place, names, like, ahlon, and, kyaukmyaung, still, endure, to, this, date, in, yangon, by, the, eve,

dhammathat, lit, manu, kye, law, book, a, compilation, of, existing, laws, and, customs, and, of, the, rulings, preserved, in, previous, law, books, although, the, law, book, was, poorly, arranged, and, offered, little, explanations, on, contradictory, passages, it, attained, enormous, popularity, owing, to, its, encyclopedic, nature, and, to, its, being, written, in, simple, burmese, with, little, pali, alaungpaya, was, a, charismatic, military, leader, of, the, first, quality, who, deeply, inspired, his, people, to, do, greater, things, he, was, lavish, in, his, praise, and, rewards, but, also, merciless, in, failure, according, to, ge, harvey, men, felt, that, when, he, led, them, they, could, not, fail, and, to, be, named, at, one, of, his, investitures, was, the, ambition, of, men, s, lives, the, most, important, legacy, of, alaungpaya, was, the, restoration, of, central, rule, in, burma, for, the, first, time, in, four, decades, and, the, rise, of, the, konbaung, dynasty, alaungpaya, according, to, the, burmese, historian, htin, aung, led, a, people, divided, and, broken, humiliated, and, ashamed, and, left, to, his, successors, a, people, united, and, confident, holding, up, their, heads, again, in, pride, and, in, glory, but, htin, aung, also, cautions, that, alaungpaya, had, led, his, people, in, waging, war, but, his, leadership, was, still, sorely, needed, to, wage, a, peace, he, had, roused, his, people, to, the, fever, heat, of, nationalism, but, he, was, denied, the, time, and, the, opportunity, to, calm, them, down, to, tolerance, and, restraint, indeed, overconfident, konbaung, kings, that, followed, him, would, go, to, war, with, all, the, neighbors, in, the, next, seven, decades, on, their, way, to, founding, the, second, largest, burmese, empire, until, they, were, defeated, by, the, british, in, present, day, northeastern, india, alaungpaya, has, also, been, named, as, the, first, king, of, burma, to, consciously, manipulate, ethnic, identity, as, a, means, to, military, and, political, domination, to, date, mon, nationalists, hold, him, accountable, for, the, utter, destruction, of, the, mon, country, and, the, end, of, centuries, long, mon, dominance, of, lower, burma, according, to, one, mon, nationalist, historian, the, racial, oppression, practiced, by, alaungpaya, was, worse, than, that, of, previous, kings, he, ended, the, cultural, autonomy, adopted, by, the, burmese, rulers, of, the, pagan, era, and, by, kings, tabinshwehti, and, bayinnaung, and, colonized, the, mon, state, the,
