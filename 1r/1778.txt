johann, bernoulli, also, known, as, jean, in, french, or, john, in, english, 6, august, 1667, 1, january, 1748, was, a, swiss, mathematician, and, was, one, of, the, many, prominent, mathematicians, in, the, bernoulli, family, he, is, known, for, his, contributions, to, infinitesimal, calculus, and, educating, leonhard, euler, in, the, pupil, s, youth, johann, was, born, in, basel, the, son, of, nicolaus, bernoulli, an, apothecary, and, his, wife, margarethe, schongauer, and, began, studying, medicine, at, university, of, basel, his, father, desired, that, he, study, business, so, that, he, might, take, over, the, family, spice, trade, but, johann, bernoulli, did, not, like, business, and, convinced, his, father, to, allow, him, to, study, medicine, instead, johann, bernoulli, began, studying, mathematics, on, the, side, with, his, older, brother, jacob, bernoulli, throughout, johann, bernoulli, s, education, at, basel, university, the, bernoulli, brothers, worked, together, spending, much, of, their, time, studying, the, newly, discovered, infinitesimal, calculus, they, were, among, the, first, mathematicians, to, not, only, study, and, understand, calculus, but, to, apply, it, to, various, problems, in, 1690, he, completed, a, degree, dissertation, in, medicine, reviewed, by, leibniz, whose, title, was, de, motu, musculorum, et, de, effervescent, et, fermentation, after, graduating, from, basel, university, johann, bernoulli, moved, to, teach, differential, equations, later, in, 1694, he, married, dorothea, falkner, the, daughter, of, an, alderman, of, basel, and, soon, after, accepted, a, position, as, the, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, groningen, at, the, request, of, his, father, in, law, bernoulli, began, the, voyage, back, to, his, home, town, of, basel, in, 1705, just, after, setting, out, on, the, journey, he, learned, of, his, brother, s, death, to, tuberculosis, bernoulli, had, planned, on, becoming, the, professor, of, greek, at, basel, university, upon, returning, but, instead, was, able, to, take, over, as, professor, of, mathematics, his, older, brother, s, former, position, as, a, student, of, leibniz, s, calculus, bernoulli, sided, with, him, in, 1713, in, the, leibniz, newton, debate, over, who, deserved, credit, for, the, discovery, of, calculus, bernoulli, defended, leibniz, by, showing, that, he, had, solved, certain, problems, with, his, methods, that, newton, had, failed, to, solve, bernoulli, also, promoted, descartes, vortex, theory, over, newton, s, theory, of, gravitation, this, ultimately, delayed, acceptance, of, newton, s, theory, in, continental, europe, in, 1724, johann, bernoulli, entered, a, competition, sponsored, by, the, french, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, which, posed, the, question, in, defending, a, view, previously, espoused, by, leibniz, he, found, himself, postulating, an, infinite, external, force, required, to, make, the, body, elastic, by, overcoming, the, infinite, internal, force, making, the, body, hard, in, consequence, he, was, disqualified, for, the, prize, which, was, won, by, maclaurin, however, bernoulli, s, paper, was, subsequently, accepted, in, 1726, when, the, acad, mie, considered, papers, regarding, elastic, bodies, for, which, the, prize, was, awarded, to, pierre, mazi, re, bernoulli, received, an, honourable, mention, in, both, competitions, although, johann, and, his, brother, jacob, bernoulli, worked, together, before, johann, graduated, from, basel, university, shortly, after, this, the, two, developed, a, jealous, and, competitive, relationship, johann, was, jealous, of, jacob, s, position, and, the, two, often, attempted, to, outdo, each, other, after, jacob, s, death, johann, s, jealousy, shifted, toward, his, own, talented, son, daniel, in, 1738, the, father, son, duo, nearly, simultaneously, published, separate, works, on, hydrodynamics, johann, attempted, to, take, precedence, over, his, son, by, purposely, and, falsely, predating, his, work, two, years, prior, to, his, son, s, the, bernoulli, brothers, often, worked, on, the, same, problems, but, not, without, friction, their, most, bitter, dispute, concerned, the, brachistochrone, curve, problem, or, the, equation, for, the, path, followed, by, a, particle, from, one, point, to, another, in, the, shortest, amount, of, time, if, the, particle, is, acted, upon, by, gravity, alone, johann, presented, the, problem, in, 1696, offering, a, reward, for, its, solution, entering, the, challenge, johann, proposed, the, cycloid, the, path, of, a, point, on, a, moving, wheel, also, pointing, out, the, relation, this, curve, bears, to, the, path, taken, by, a, ray, of, light, passing, through, layers, of, varied, density, jacob, proposed, the, same, solution, but, johann, s, derivation, of, the, solution, was, incorrect, and, he, presented, his, brother, jacob, s, derivation, as, his, own, bernoulli, was, hired, by, guillaume, de, l, h, pital, for, tutoring, in, mathematics, bernoulli, and, l, h, pital, signed, a, contract, which, gave, l, h, pital, the, right, to, use, bernoulli, s, discoveries, as, he, pleased, l, h, pital, authored, the, first, textbook, on, infinitesimal, calculus, analyse, des, infiniment, petits, pour, l, intelligence, des, lignes, courbes, in, 1696, which, mainly, consisted, of, the, work, of, bernoulli, including, what, is, now, known, as, l, h, pital, s, rule, subsequently, in, letters, to, leibniz, varignon, and, others, bernoulli, complained, that, he, had, not, received, enough, credit, for, his, contributions, in, spite, of, the, preface, of, his, book, i, recognize, i, owe, much, to, the, insights, of, the, messrs, bernoulli, especially, to, those, of, the, younger, john, currently, a, professor, in, groningen, i, did, unceremoniously, use, their, discoveries, as, well, as, those, of, mr, leibniz, for, this, reason, i, consent, that, they, claim, as, much, credit, as, they, please, and, will, content, myself, with, what, they, will, agree, to, leave, me
