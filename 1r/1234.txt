suffered, from, burns, when, the, chemicals, in, her, perfume, were, ignited, by, a, nearby, lamp, while, in, agra, this, event, precipitated, a, family, crisis, with, political, consequences, aurangzeb, suffered, his, father, s, displeasure, by, not, returning, to, agra, immediately, but, rather, three, weeks, later, shah, jahan, had, been, nursing, jahanara, back, to, health, in, that, time, and, thousands, of, vassals, had, arrived, in, agra, to, pay, their, respects, shah, jahan, was, outraged, to, see, aurangzeb, enter, the, interior, palace, compound, in, military, attire, and, immediately, dismissed, him, from, his, position, of, viceroy, of, the, deccan, aurangzeb, was, also, no, longer, allowed, to, use, red, tents, or, to, associate, himself, with, the, official, military, standard, of, the, mughal, emperor, other, sources, state, that, aurangzeb, was, dismissed, from, his, position, because, aurangzeb, left, the, life, of, luxury, and, became, a, faqir, in, 1645, he, was, barred, from, the, court, for, seven, months, it, is, reported, that, he, mentioned, his, grief, about, this, to, fellow, mughal, commanders, thereafter, shah, jahan, appointed, him, governor, of, gujarat, his, rule, in, gujarat, was, marked, with, religious, disputes, but, he, was, rewarded, for, bringing, stability, in, 1647, shah, jahan, moved, aurangzeb, from, gujarat, to, be, governor, of, balkh, replacing, a, younger, son, murad, baksh, who, had, proved, ineffective, there, the, area, was, under, attack, from, uzbek, and, turkmen, tribes, the, mughal, artillery, and, muskets, were, matched, by, the, skirmishing, skills, of, their, opponents, which, led, to, a, stalemate, aurangzeb, discovered, that, his, army, could, not, live, off, the, land, which, was, devastated, by, war, it, is, recorded, that, during, the, battle, against, the, uzbeks, during, this, campaign, aurangzeb, dismounted, from, his, elephant, ride, to, recite, prayer, to, the, surprise, of, the, opposing, force, commander, with, the, onset, of, winter, he, and, his, father, had, to, make, an, unsatisfactory, deal, with, the, uzbeks, they, had, to, give, away, territory, in, exchange, for, nominal, recognition, of, mughal, sovereignty, the, mughal, force, suffered, still, further, with, attacks, by, uzbeks, and, other, tribesmen, as, it, retreated, through, the, snow, to, kabul, by, the, end, of, this, two, year, campaign, into, which, aurangzeb, had, been, plunged, at, a, late, stage, a, vast, sum, of, money, had, been, expended, for, little, gain, further, unsuccessful, military, involvements, followed, as, aurangzeb, was, appointed, governor, of, multan, and, sindh, his, efforts, in, 1649, and, 1652, to, dislodge, the, safavids, at, kandahar, which, they, had, recently, retaken, after, a, decade, of, mughal, control, both, ended, in, failure, as, winter, approached, the, logistical, problems, of, supplying, an, army, at, the, extremity, of, the, empire, combined, with, the, poor, quality, of, armaments, and, the, intransigence, of, the, opposition, have, been, cited, by, john, richards, as, the, reasons, for, failure, a, third, attempt, in, 1653, led, by, dara, shikoh, met, with, the, same, outcome, aurangzeb, became, viceroy, of, the, deccan, again, after, he, was, replaced, by, dara, shukoh, in, the, attempt, to, recapture, kandahar, aurangbad, s, two, jagirs, land, grants, were, moved, there, as, a, consequence, of, his, return, the, deccan, was, a, relatively, impoverished, area, this, caused, him, to, lose, out, financially, the, area, required, grants, were, required, from, malwa, and, gujarat, in, order, to, maintain, the, administration, the, situation, caused, ill, feeling, between, him, and, his, father, shah, jahan, who, insisted, that, things, could, be, improved, if, aurangzeb, made, efforts, to, develop, cultivation, aurangzeb, appointed, murshid, quli, khan, to, extend, to, the, deccan, the, zabt, revenue, system, used, in, northern, india, murshid, quli, khan, organised, a, survey, of, agricultural, land, and, a, tax, assessment, on, what, it, produced, to, increase, revenue, murshid, quli, khan, granted, loans, for, seed, livestock, and, irrigation, infrastructure, this, led, the, deccan, region, to, return, to, prosperity, aurangzeb, proposed, to, resolve, financial, difficulties, by, attacking, the, dynastic, occupants, of, golconda, the, qutb, shahis, and, bijapur, the, adil, shahis, this, proposal, would, also, extend, mughal, influence, by, accruing, more, lands, aurangzeb, advanced, against, the, sultan, of, bijapur, and, besieged, bidar, the, kiladar, governor, or, captain, of, the, fortified, city, sidi, marjan, was, mortally, wounded, when, a, gunpowder, magazine, exploded, after, twenty, seven, days, of, fighting, bidar, was, captured, by, the, mughals, and, aurangzeb, continued, his, advance, aurangzeb, suspected, dara, had, exerted, influence, on, his, father, he, believed, that, he, was, on, the, verge, of, victory, in, both, instances, and, was, frustrated, that, shah, jahan, chose, then, to, settle, for, negotiations, with, the, opposing, forces, rather, than, pushing, for, complete, victory, the, four, sons, of, shah, jahan, all, held, governorships, during, their, father, s, reign, the, emperor, favoured, the, eldest, dara, shikoh, this, had, caused, resentment, among, the, younger, three, who, sought, at, various, times, to, strengthen, alliances, between, themselves, and, against, dara, there, was, no, mughal, tradition, of, primogeniture, the, systematic, passing, of, rule, upon, an, emperor, s, death, to, his, eldest, son, instead, it, was, customary, for, sons, to, overthrow, their, father, and, for, brothers, to, war, to, the, death, among, themselves, historian, satish, chandra, says, that, in, the, ultimate, resort, connections, among, the, powerful, military, leaders, and, military, strength, and, capacity, the, real, arbiters, the, contest, for, power, was, primarily, between, dara, shikoh, and, aurangzeb, because, although, all, four, sons, had, demonstrated, competence, in, their, official, roles, it, was, around, these, two, that, the, supporting, cast, of, officials, and, other, influential, people, mostly, circulated, there, were, ideological, differences, dara, was, an, intellectual, and, a, religious, liberal, in, the, mould, of, akbar, while, aurangzeb, was, much, more, conservative, but, as, historians, barbara, d, metcalf, and, thomas, r, metcalf, say, to, focus, on, divergent, philosophies, neglects, the, fact, that, dara, was, a, poor, general, and, leader, it, also, ignores, the, fact, that, factional, lines, in, the, succession, dispute, were, not, by, and, large, shaped, by, ideology, marc, gaborieau, professor, of, indian, studies, at, l, cole, des, hautes, tudes, en, sciences, sociales, explains, that, the, loyalties, of, seem, to, have, been, motivated, more, by, their, own, interests, the, closeness, of, the, family, relation, and, above, all, the, charisma, of, the, pretenders, than, by, ideological, divides, muslims, and, hindus, did, not, divide, along, religious, lines, in, their, support, for, one, pretender, or, the, other, nor, according, to, chandra, is, there, much, evidence, to, support, the, belief, that, jahanara, and, other, members, of, the, royal, family, were, split, in, their, support, jahanara, certainly, interceded, at, various, times, on, behalf, of, all, of, the, princes, and, was, well, regarded, by, aurangzeb, even, though, she, shared, the, religious, outlook, of, dara, in, 1656, a, general, under, qutb, shahi, dynasty, named, musa, khan, led, an, army, of, 12, 000, musketeers, to, attack, aurangzeb, who, was, besieging, golconda, fort, later, in, the, same, campaign, aurangzeb, in, turn, rode, against, an, army, consisting, of, 8, 000, horsemen, and, 20, 000, karnataki, musketeers, after, making, clear, his, desire, for, his, son, dara, to, take, over, after, him, shah, jahan, fell, ill, with, stranguary, in, 1657, he, was, kept, in, seclusion, and, cared, for, by, dara, in, the, newly, built, city, of, shahjahanabad, old, delhi, rumours, spread, that, shah, jahan, had, died, which, led, to, concerns, among, his, younger, sons, subsequently, these, younger, sons, took, military, actions, seemingly, in, response, but, it, is, not, known, whether, these, preparations, were, made, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, the, rumours, of, death, of, shah, jahan, were, true, and, that, dara, might, be, hiding, it, for, political, gain, or, whether, the, challengers, were, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, shah, shuja, in, bengal, where, he, had, been, governor, since, 1637, crowned, himself, king, at, rajmahal, he, brought, his, cavalry, artillery, and, river, flotilla, upriver, towards, agra, near, varanasi, his, forces, confronted, a, defending, army, sent, from, delhi, under, the, command, of, prince, sulaiman, shukoh, son, of, dara, shukoh, and, raja, jai, singh, murad, did, the, same, in, his, governorship, of, gujarat, and, aurangzeb, did, so, in, the, deccan, after, regaining, some, of, his, health, shah, jahan, moved, to, agra, and, dara, urged, him, to, send, forces, to, challenge, shah, shuja, and, murad, who, had, declared, themselves, rulers, in, their, respective, territories, while, shah, shuja, was, defeated, at, banares, in, february, 1658, the, army, sent, to, deal, with, murad, discovered, to, their, surprise, that, he, and, aurangzeb, had, combined, their, forces, the, two, brothers, having, agreed, to, partition, the, empire, once, they, had, gained, control, of, it, the, two, armies, clashed, at, dharmat, in, april, 1658, with, aurangzeb, being, the, victor, shuja, was, chased, through, bihar, the, victory, of, aurangzeb, proved, this, to, be, a, poor, decision, by, dara, shikoh, who, now, had, a, defeated, force, on, one, front, and, a, successful, force, unnecessarily, pre, occupied, on, another, realising, that, his, recalled, bihar, forces, would, not, arrive, at, agra, in, time, to, resist, the, emboldened, aurangzeb, s, advance, dara, scrambled, to, form, alliances, in, order, but, found, that, aurangzeb, had, already, courted, key, potential, candidates, when, dara, s, disparate, hastily, concocted, army, clashed, with, aurangzeb, s, well, disciplined, battle, hardened, force, at, the, battle, of, samugarh, in, late, may, neither, dara, s, men, nor, his, generalship, were, any, match, for, aurangzeb, dara, had, also, become, over, confident, in, his, own, abilities, and, by, ignoring, advice, not, to, lead, in, battle, while, his, father, was, alive, he, cemented, the, idea, that, he, had, usurped, the, throne, after, the, defeat, of, dara, shah, jahan, was, imprisoned, in, the, fort, of, agra, where, he, spent, eight, long, years, under, the, care, of, his, favourite, daughter, jahanara, aurangzeb, then, broke, his, arrangement, with, murad, baksh, which, probably, had, been, his, intention, all, along, instead, of, looking, to, partition, the, empire, between, himself, and, murad, he, had, his, brother, arrested, and, imprisoned, at, gwalior, fort, murad, was, executed, on, 4, december, 1661, ostensibly, for, the, murder, of, the, diwan, of, gujarat, the, allegation, was, encouraged, by, aurangzeb, who, caused, the, diwan, s, son, to, seek, retribution, for, the, death, under, the, principles, of, sharia, law, meanwhile, dara, gathered, his, forces, and, moved, to, the, punjab, the, army, sent, against, shuja, was, trapped, in, the, east, its, generals, jai, singh, and, dilir, khan, submitted, to, aurangzeb, but, dara, s, son, suleiman, shikoh, escaped, aurangzeb, offered, shah, shuja, the, governorship, of, bengal, this, move, had, the, effect, of, isolating, dara, shikoh, and, causing, more, troops, to, defect, to, aurangzeb, shah, shuja, who, had, declared, himself, emperor, in, bengal, began, to, annex, more, territory, and, this, prompted, aurangzeb, to, march, from, punjab, with, a, new, and, large, army, that, fought, during, the, battle, of, khajwa, where, shah, shuja, and, his, chain, mail, armoured, war, elephants, were, routed, by, the, forces, loyal, to, aurangzeb, shah, shuja, then, fled, to, arakan, in, present, day, burma, where, he, was, executed, by, the, local, rulers, with, shuja, and, murad, disposed, of, and, with, his, father, immured, in, agra, aurangzeb, pursued, dara, shikoh, chasing, him, across, the, north, western, bounds, of, the, empire, aurangzeb, claimed, that, dara, was, no, longer, a, muslim, and, accused, him, of, poisoning, the, mughal, grand, vizier, saadullah, khan, after, a, series, of, battles, defeats, and, retreats, dara, was, betrayed, by, one, of, his, generals, who, arrested, and, bound, him, in, 1658, aurangzeb, arranged, his, formal, coronation, in, delhi, on, 10, august, 1659, dara, was, executed, on, grounds, of, apostasy, and, his, head, was, sent, to, shah, jahan, this, was, the, first, prominent, execution, of, aurangzeb, based, on, accusations, of, being, influenced, by, hinduism, however, some, sources, argue, it, was, done, for, political, reasons, aurangzeb, had, his, allied, brother, prince, murad, baksh, held, for, murder, judged, and, then, executed, aurangzeb, was, accused, of, poisoning, his, imprisoned, nephew, sulaiman, shikoh, having, secured, his, position, aurangzeb, confined, his, frail, father, at, the, agra, fort, but, did, not, mistreat, him, shah, jahan, was, cared, for, by, jahanara, and, died, in, 1666, aurangzeb, s, imperial, bureaucracy, employed, significantly, more, hindus, than, that, of, his, predecessors, between, 1679, and, 1707, the, number, of, hindu, officials, in, the, mughal, administration, rose, by, half, to, represent, 31, 6, of, mughal, nobility, the, highest, in, the, mughal, era, many, of, them, were, marathas, and, rajputs, who, were, his, political, allies, however, aurangzeb, encouraged, high, ranking, hindu, officials, to, convert, to, islam, under, his, reign, the, mughal, empire, contributed, to, the, world, s, gdp, by, nearly, 25, surpassing, qing, china, making, it, the, world, s, largest, economy, and, biggest, manufacturing, power, more, than, the, entirety, of, western, europe, and, signaled, proto, industrialization, aurangzeb, was, an, orthodox, muslim, ruler, subsequent, to, the, policies, of, his, three, predecessors, he, endeavored, to, make, islam, a, dominant, force, in, his, reign, however, these, efforts, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, forces, that, were, opposed, to, this, revival, aurangzeb, was, a, follower, of, the, mujaddidi, order, and, a, disciple, of, the, son, of, the, punjabi, saint, ahmad, sirhindi, he, sought, to, establish, islamic, rule, as, instructed, and, inspired, by, him, sheikh, muhammad, ikram, stated, that, after, returning, from, kashmir, aurangzeb, issued, order, in, 1663, to, ban, the, practice, of, sati, a, hindu, practice, to, burn, a, widow, whenever, her, husband, passed, away, ikram, recorded, that, aurangzeb, issued, decree, in, all, lands, under, mughal, control, never, again, should, the, officials, allow, a, woman, to, be, burnt, although, aurangzeb, s, orders, could, be, evaded, with, payment, of, bribes, to, officials, adds, ikram, later, european, travellers, record, that, sati, was, not, much, practised, in, mughal, empire, and, that, sati, was, very, rare, except, it, be, some, rajah, s, wives, that, the, indian, women, burn, at, all, by, the, end, of, aurangzeb, s, reign, historian, katherine, brown, has, noted, that, the, very, name, of, aurangzeb, seems, to, act, in, the, popular, imagination, as, a, signifier, of, politico, religious, bigotry, and, repression, regardless, of, historical, accuracy, the, subject, has, also, resonated, in, modern, times, with, popularly, accepted, claims, that, he, intended, to, destroy, the, bamiyan, buddhas, as, a, political, and, religious, conservative, aurangzeb, chose, not, to, follow, the, secular, religious, viewpoints, of, his, predecessors, after, his, ascension, he, made, no, mention, of, the, persian, concept, of, kinship, the, farr, i, aizadi, and, based, his, rule, on, the, quranic, concept, of, kingship, shah, jahan, had, already, moved, away, from, the, liberalism, of, akbar, although, in, a, token, manner, rather, than, with, the, intent, of, suppressing, hinduism, and, aurangzeb, took, the, change, still, further, though, the, approach, to, faith, of, akbar, jahangir, and, shah, jahan, was, more, syncretic, than, babur, the, founder, of, the, empire, aurangzeb, s, position, is, not, so, obvious, his, emphasis, on, sharia, competed, or, was, directly, in, conflict, with, his, insistence, that, zawabit, or, secular, decrees, could, supersede, sharia, the, chief, qazi, refusing, to, crown, him, in, 1659, aurangzeb, had, a, political, need, to, present, himself, as, a, defender, of, the, sharia, due, to, popular, opposition, to, his, actions, against, his, father, and, brothers, despite, claims, of, sweeping, edicts, and, policies, contradictory, accounts, exist, historian, katherine, brown, has, argued, that, aurangzeb, never, imposed, a, complete, ban, on, music, he, sought, to,

of, aurangzeb, shortly, after, coming, to, power, aurangzeb, remitted, more, than, 80, long, standing, taxes, affecting, all, of, his, subjects, in, 1679, aurangzeb, chose, to, re, impose, jizya, a, military, tax, on, non, muslim, subjects, in, lieu, of, military, service, after, an, abatement, for, a, span, of, hundred, years, in, what, was, critiqued, by, many, hindu, rulers, family, members,

against, 2, 5, on, muslim, merchants, which, led, to, considerable, dislike, of, aurangzeb, s, economic, policies, a, sharp, turn, from, akbar, s, uniform, tax, code, according, to, marc, jason, gilbert, aurangzeb, ordered, the, jizya, fees, to, be, paid, in, person, in, front, of, a, tax, collector, where, the, non, muslims, were, to, recite, a, verse, in, the, quran, which, referred, to, their, inferior, status, as, non, muslims, this, decision, led, to, protests, and, lamentations, among, the, masses, as, well, as, hindu, court, officials, in, order, to, meet, state, expenditures, aurangzeb, had, ordered, increases, in, land, taxes, the, burden, of, which, fell, heavily, upon, the, hindu, jats, the, reimposition, of, the, jizya, encouraged, hindus, to, flee, to, areas, under,

to, diminish, however, aurangzeb, did, endow, some, significant, structures, catherine, asher, terms, his, architectural, period, as, an, islamization, of, mughal, architecture, one, of, the,

the, artisans, particularly, in, textiles, flourished, by, employing, hundreds, of, embroiderers, who, were, superintended, by, a, master, he, further, writes, how, artisans, manufacture, of, silk, fine, brocade, and, other, fine, muslins, of, which, are, made, turbans, robes, of, gold, flowers, and, tunics, worn, by, females, so, delicately, fine, as, to, wear, out, in, one, night, and, cost,

and, medina, historian, naimur, rahman, farooqi, writes, that, by, 1694, aurangzeb, s, ardour, for, the, sharifs, of, mecca, had, begun, to, wane, their, greed, and, rapacity, had, thoroughly, disillusioned, the, emperor, aurangzeb, expressed, his, disgust, at, the, unethical, behavior, of, the, sharif, who, appropriated, all, the, money, sent, to, the, hijaz, for, his, own, use, thus, depriving, the, needy, and, the, poor, according, to, english, traveller, named, john, fryar, aurangzeb, also, consider, that, despite, his, enormous, power, on, land, it, is, cheaper, to, establish, reciprocal, relation, with, the, naval, forces, of, portuguese, empire, to, secure, the, sea, interest, of, ships, in, mughal, territory, so, he, did, not, built, an, overtly, massive, naval, forces,

1672, under, the, leadership, of, the, warrior, poet, khushal, khan, khattak, of, kabul, was, triggered, when, soldiers, under, the, orders, of, the, mughal, governor, amir, khan, allegedly, molested, a, parachi, woman, affiliated, with, the, safi, in, modern, day, kunar, province, of, afghanistan, the, safi, tribes, retaliated, against, the, soldiers, this, attack, provoked, a, reprisal, which,

impact, of, this, was, to, leave, a, lasting, legacy, of, mistrust, among, the, tribes, after, that, the, revolt, spread, with, the, mughals, suffering, a, near, total, collapse, of, their, authority, in, the, pashtun, belt, the, closure, of, the, important, attock, kabul, trade, route, along, the, grand, trunk, road, was, particularly, disastrous, by, 1674, the, situation, had, deteriorated, to, a, point, where, aurangzeb, camped, at, attock, to, personally, take, charge, switching, to, diplomacy, and, bribery, along, with, force, of, arms, the, mughals, eventually, split, the, rebels, and,

especially, with, the, marathas, drove, his, empire, to, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, just, as, much, as, the, wasteful, personal, spending, and, opulence, of, his, predecessors, the, indologist, stanley, wolpert, emeritus, professor, at, ucla, says, that, the, conquest, of, the, deccan, to, which, aurangzeb, devoted, the, last, twenty, six, years, of, his, life, was, in, many, ways, a,

political, opposition, as, pretext, for, religious, persecution, and, that, as, a, result, groups, of, jats, marathas, sikhs, satnamis, and, pashtuns, rose, against, him, multiple, interpretations, of, aurangzeb, s, life, and, reign, over, the, years, by, critics, have, led, to, a, very, complicated, legacy, some, argue, that, his, policies, abandoned, his, predecessors, legacy, of, pluralism, and, religious, tolerance, citing, his, introduction, of, the, jizya, tax, and, other, policies, based, on, islamic, ethics, his, demolition, of, hindu, temples, the, executions, of, his, elder,

his, destruction, of, temples, has, been, exaggerated, and, noting, that, he, built, more, temples, than, he, destroyed, paid, for, their, maintenance, employed, significantly, more, hindus, in, his, imperial, bureaucracy, than, his, predecessors, and, opposed, bigotry, against, hindus, and, shia, muslims, muhammad, al, munajjid, has, compilled, that, the, opinions, from, islamic, scholarly,

by, muhammad, saleh, kamboh, who, acted, as, his, teacher, in, pakistan, author, haroon, khalid, writes, that, aurangzeb, is, presented, as, a, hero, who, fought, and, expanded, the, frontiers, of, the, islamic, empire, and, is, imagined, to, be, a, true, believer, who, removed, corrupt, practices, from, religion, and, the, court, and, once, again, purified, the, empire, the, academic, munis,

cultural, and, religious, syncretism, of, the, previous, mughal, emperors, aurangzeb, acted, more, as, a, moslem, than, an, indian, ruler, while, mahatma, gandhi, was, of, the, view, that, there, was,
