josiah, willard, gibbs, b, z, february, 11, 1839, april, 28, 1903, was, an, american, scientist, who, made, significant, theoretical, contributions, to, physics, chemistry, and, mathematics, his, work, on, the, applications, of, thermodynamics, was, instrumental, in, transforming, physical, chemistry, into, a, rigorous, deductive, science, together, with, james, clerk, maxwell, and, ludwig, boltzmann, he, created, statistical, mechanics, a, term, that, he, coined, explaining, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, as, consequences, of, the, statistical, properties, of, ensembles, of, the, possible, states, of, a, physical, system, composed, of, many, particles, gibbs, also, worked, on, the, application, of, maxwell, s, equations, to, problems, in, physical, optics, as, a, mathematician, he, created, modern, vector, calculus, independently, of, the, british, scientist, oliver, heaviside, who, carried, out, similar, work, during, the, same, period, and, described, the, gibbs, phenomenon, in, the, theory, of, fourier, analysis, in, 1863, yale, university, awarded, gibbs, the, first, american, doctorate, in, engineering, after, a, three, year, sojourn, in, europe, gibbs, spent, the, rest, of, his, career, at, yale, where, he, was, a, professor, of, mathematical, physics, from, 1871, until, his, death, in, 1903, working, in, relative, isolation, he, became, the, earliest, theoretical, scientist, in, the, united, states, to, earn, an, international, reputation, and, was, praised, by, albert, einstein, as, the, greatest, mind, in, american, history, in, 1901, gibbs, received, what, was, then, considered, the, highest, honor, awarded, by, the, international, scientific, community, the, copley, medal, of, the, royal, society, of, london, for, his, contributions, to, mathematical, physics, commentators, and, biographers, have, remarked, on, the, contrast, between, gibbs, s, quiet, solitary, life, in, turn, of, the, century, new, england, and, the, great, international, impact, of, his, ideas, though, his, work, was, almost, entirely, theoretical, the, practical, value, of, gibbs, s, contributions, became, evident, with, the, development, of, industrial, chemistry, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, according, to, robert, a, millikan, in, pure, science, gibbs, did, for, statistical, mechanics, and, thermodynamics, what, laplace, did, for, celestial, mechanics, and, maxwell, did, for, electrodynamics, namely, made, his, field, a, well, nigh, finished, theoretical, structure, gibbs, was, born, in, new, haven, connecticut, he, belonged, to, an, old, yankee, family, that, had, produced, distinguished, american, clergymen, and, academics, since, the, 17th, century, he, was, the, fourth, of, five, children, and, the, only, son, of, josiah, willard, gibbs, sr, and, his, wife, mary, anna, n, e, van, cleve, on, his, father, s, side, he, was, descended, from, samuel, willard, who, served, as, acting, president, of, harvard, college, from, 1701, to, 1707, on, his, mother, s, side, one, of, his, ancestors, was, the, rev, jonathan, dickinson, the, first, president, of, the, college, of, new, jersey, later, princeton, university, gibbs, s, given, name, which, he, shared, with, his, father, and, several, other, members, of, his, extended, family, derived, from, his, ancestor, josiah, willard, who, had, been, secretary, of, the, province, of, massachusetts, bay, in, the, 18th, century, his, paternal, grandmother, mercy, prescott, gibbs, was, the, sister, of, rebecca, minot, prescott, sherman, the, wife, of, american, founding, father, roger, sherman, and, he, was, the, second, cousin, of, roger, sherman, baldwin, see, the, amistad, case, below, the, elder, gibbs, was, generally, known, to, his, family, and, colleagues, as, josiah, while, the, son, was, called, willard, josiah, gibbs, was, a, linguist, and, theologian, who, served, as, professor, of, sacred, literature, at, yale, divinity, school, from, 1824, until, his, death, in, 1861, he, is, chiefly, remembered, today, as, the, abolitionist, who, found, an, interpreter, for, the, african, passengers, of, the, ship, amistad, allowing, them, to, testify, during, the, trial, that, followed, their, rebellion, against, being, sold, as, slaves, willard, gibbs, was, educated, at, the, hopkins, school, and, entered, yale, college, in, 1854, at, the, age, of, 15, at, yale, gibbs, received, prizes, for, excellence, in, mathematics, and, latin, and, he, graduated, in, 1858, near, the, top, of, his, class, he, remained, at, yale, as, a, graduate, student, at, the, sheffield, scientific, school, at, age, 19, soon, after, his, graduation, from, college, gibbs, was, inducted, into, the, connecticut, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, a, scholarly, institution, composed, primarily, of, members, of, the, yale, faculty, relatively, few, documents, from, the, period, survive, and, it, is, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, details, of, gibbs, s, early, career, with, precision, in, the, opinion, of, biographers, gibbs, s, principal, mentor, and, champion, both, at, yale, and, in, the, connecticut, academy, was, probably, the, astronomer, and, mathematician, hubert, anson, newton, a, leading, authority, on, meteors, who, remained, gibbs, s, lifelong, friend, and, confidant, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1861, gibbs, inherited, enough, money, to, make, him, financially, independent, recurrent, pulmonary, trouble, ailed, the, young, gibbs, and, his, physicians, were, concerned, that, he, might, be, susceptible, to, tuberculosis, which, had, killed, his, mother, he, also, suffered, from, astigmatism, whose, treatment, was, then, still, largely, unfamiliar, to, oculists, so, that, gibbs, had, to, diagnose, himself, and, grind, his, own, lenses, though, in, later, years, he, used, glasses, only, for, reading, or, other, close, work, gibbs, s, delicate, health, and, imperfect, eyesight, probably, explain, why, he, did, not, volunteer, to, fight, in, the, civil, war, of, 1861, 65, he, was, not, conscripted, and, he, remained, at, yale, for, the, duration, of, the, war, in, 1863, gibbs, received, the, first, doctorate, of, philosophy, phd, in, engineering, granted, in, the, us, for, a, thesis, entitled, on, the, form, of, the, teeth, of, wheels, in, spur, gearing, in, which, he, used, geometrical, techniques, to, investigate, the, optimum, design, for, gears, in, 1861, yale, had, become, the, first, us, university, to, offer, a, phd, degree, and, gibbs, s, was, only, the, fifth, phd, granted, in, the, us, in, any, subject, after, graduation, gibbs, was, appointed, as, tutor, at, the, college, for, a, term, of, three, years, during, the, first, two, years, he, taught, latin, and, during, the, third, year, he, taught, natural, philosophy, i, e, physics, in, 1866, he, patented, a, design, for, a, railway, brake, and, read, a, paper, before, the, connecticut, academy, entitled, the, proper, magnitude, of, the, units, of, length, in, which, he, proposed, a, scheme, for, rationalizing, the, system, of, units, of, measurement, used, in, mechanics, after, his, term, as, tutor, ended, gibbs, traveled, to, europe, with, his, sisters, they, spent, the, winter, of, 1866, 67, in, paris, where, gibbs, attended, lectures, at, the, sorbonne, and, the, coll, ge, de, france, given, by, such, distinguished, mathematical, scientists, as, joseph, liouville, and, michel, chasles, having, undertaken, a, punishing, regimen, of, study, gibbs, caught, a, serious, cold, and, a, doctor, fearing, tuberculosis, advised, him, to, rest, on, the, riviera, where, he, and, his, sisters, spent, several, months, and, where, he, made, a, full, recovery, moving, to, berlin, gibbs, attended, the, lectures, taught, by, mathematicians, karl, weierstrass, and, leopold, kronecker, as, well, as, by, chemist, heinrich, gustav, magnus, in, august, 1867, gibbs, s, sister, julia, was, married, in, berlin, to, addison, van, name, who, had, been, gibbs, s, classmate, at, yale, the, newly, married, couple, returned, to, new, haven, leaving, gibbs, and, his, sister, anna, in, germany, in, heidelberg, gibbs, was, exposed, to, the, work, of, physicists, gustav, kirchhoff, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, and, chemist, robert, bunsen, at, the, time, german, academics, were, the, leading, authorities, in, the, natural, sciences, especially, chemistry, and, thermodynamics, gibbs, returned, to, yale, in, june, 1869, and, briefly, taught, french, to, engineering, students, it, was, probably, also, around, this, time, that, he, worked, on, a, new, design, for, a, steam, engine, governor, his, last, significant, investigation, in, mechanical, engineering, in, 1871, he, was, appointed, professor, of, mathematical, physics, at, yale, the, first, such, professorship, in, the, united, states, gibbs, who, had, independent, means, and, had, yet, to, publish, anything, was, assigned, to, teach, graduate, students, exclusively, and, was, hired, without, salary, gibbs, published, his, first, work, in, 1873, his, papers, on, the, geometric, representation, of, thermodynamic, quantities, appeared, in, the, transactions, of, the, connecticut, academy, these, papers, introduced, the, use, of, different, type, phase, diagrams, which, were, his, favorite, aids, to, the, imagination, process, when, doing, research, rather, than, the, mechanical, models, such, as, the, ones, that, maxwell, used, in, constructing, his, electromagnetic, theory, which, might, not, completely, represent, their, corresponding, phenomena, although, the, journal, had, few, readers, capable, of, understanding, gibbs, s, work, he, shared, reprints, with, correspondents, in, europe, and, received, an, enthusiastic, response, from, james, clerk, maxwell, at, cambridge, maxwell, even, made, with, his, own, hands, a, clay, model, illustrating, gibbs, s, construct, he, then, produced, two, plaster, casts, of, his, model, and, mailed, one, to, gibbs, that, cast, is, on, display, at, the, yale, physics, department, maxwell, included, a, chapter, on, gibbs, s, work, in, the, next, edition, of, his, theory, of, heat, published, in, 1875, he, explained, the, usefulness, of, gibbs, s, graphical, methods, in, a, lecture, to, the, chemical, society, of, london, and, even, referred, to, it, in, the, article, on, diagrams, that, he, wrote, for, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, prospects, of, collaboration, between, him, and, gibbs, were, cut, short, by, maxwell, s, early, death, in, 1879, aged, 48, the, joke, later, circulated, in, new, haven, that, only, one, man, lived, who, could, understand, gibbs, s, papers, that, was, maxwell, and, now, he, is, dead, gibbs, then, extended, his, thermodynamic, analysis, to, multi, phase, chemical, systems, i, e, to, systems, composed, of, more, than, one, form, of, matter, and, considered, a, variety, of, concrete, applications, he, described, that, research, in, a, monograph, titled, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, published, by, the, connecticut, academy, in, two, parts, that, appeared, respectively, in, 1875, and, 1878, that, work, which, covers, about, three, hundred, pages, and, contains, exactly, seven, hundred, numbered, mathematical, equations, begins, with, a, quotation, from, rudolf, clausius, that, expresses, what, would, later, be, called, the, first, and, second, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, energy, of, the, world, is, constant, the, entropy, of, the, world, tends, towards, a, maximum, gibbs, s, monograph, rigorously, and, ingeniously, applied, his, thermodynamic, techniques, to, the, interpretation, of, physico, chemical, phenomena, explaining, and, relating, what, had, previously, been, a, mass, of, isolated, facts, and, observations, the, work, has, been, described, as, the, principia, of, thermodynamics, and, as, a, work, of, practically, unlimited, scope, it, solidly, laid, the, foundation, for, physical, chemistry, wilhelm, ostwald, who, translated, gibbs, s, monograph, into, german, referred, to, gibbs, as, the, founder, of, chemical, energetics, according, to, modern, commentators, it, is, universally, recognised, that, its, publication, was, an, event, of, the, first, importance, in, the, history, of, chemistry, nevertheless, it, was, a, number, of, years, before, its, value, was, generally, known, this, delay, was, due, largely, to, the, fact, that, its, mathematical, form, and, rigorous, deductive, processes, make, it, difficult, reading, for, anyone, and, especially, so, for, students, of, experimental, chemistry, whom, it, most, concerns, gibbs, continued, to, work, without, pay, until, 1880, when, the, new, johns, hopkins, university, in, baltimore, maryland, offered, him, a, position, paying, 3, 000, per, year, in, response, yale, offered, him, an, annual, salary, of, 2, 000, which, he, was, content, to, accept, in, 1879, gibbs, derived, the, gibbs, appell, equation, of, motion, rediscovered, in, 1900, by, paul, mile, appell, from, 1880, to, 1884, gibbs, worked, on, developing, the, exterior, algebra, of, hermann, grassmann, into, a, vector, calculus, well, suited, to, the, needs, of, physicists, with, this, object, in, mind, gibbs, distinguished, between, the, dot, and, cross, products, of, two, vectors, and, introduced, the, concept, of, dyadics, similar, work, was, carried, out, independently, and, at, around, the, same, time, by, the, british, mathematical, physicist, and, engineer, oliver, heaviside, gibbs, sought, to, convince, other, physicists, of, the, convenience, of, the, vectorial, approach, over, the, quaternionic, calculus, of, william, rowan, hamilton, which, was, then, widely, used, by, british, scientists, this, led, him, in, the, early, 1890s, to, a, controversy, with, peter, guthrie, tait, and, others, in, the, pages, of, nature, gibbs, s, lecture, notes, on, vector, calculus, were, privately, printed, in, 1881, and, 1884, for, the, use, of, his, students, and, were, later, adapted, by, edwin, bidwell, wilson, into, a, textbook, vector, analysis, published, in, 1901, that, book, helped, to, popularize, the, del, notation, that, is, widely, used, today, in, electrodynamics, and, fluid, mechanics, in, other, mathematical, work, he, re, discovered, the, gibbs, phenomenon, in, the, theory, of, fourier, series, which, unbeknownst, to, him, and, to, later, scholars, had, been, described, fifty, years, before, by, an, obscure, english, mathematician, henry, wilbraham, from, 1882, to, 1889, gibbs, wrote, five, papers, on, physical, optics, in, which, he, investigated, birefringence, and, other, optical, phenomena, and, defended, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, theory, of, light, against, the, mechanical, theories, of, lord, kelvin, and, others, in, his, work, on, optics, just, as, much, as, in, his, work, on, thermodynamics, gibbs, deliberately, avoided, speculating, about, the, microscopic, structure, of, matter, and, purposefully, confined, his, research, problems, to, those, that, can, be, solved, from, broad, general, principles, and, experimentally, confirmed, facts, the, methods, that, he, used, were, highly, original, and, the, obtained, results, showed, decisively, the, correctness, of, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, theory, gibbs, coined, the, term, statistical, mechanics, and, introduced, key, concepts, in, the, corresponding, mathematical, description, of, physical, systems, including, the, notions, of, chemical, potential, 1876, and, statistical, ensemble, 1902, gibbs, s, derivation, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, from, the, statistical, properties, of, systems, consisting, of, many, particles, was, presented, in, his, highly, influential, textbook, elementary, principles, in, statistical, mechanics, published, in, 1902, a, year, before, his, death, gibbs, s, retiring, personality, and, intense, focus, on, his, work, limited, his, accessibility, to, students, his, principal, prot, g, was, edwin, bidwell, wilson, who, nonetheless, explained, that, except, in, the, classroom, i, saw, very, little, of, gibbs, he, had, a, way, toward, the, end, of, the, afternoon, of, taking, a, stroll, about, the, streets, between, his, study, in, the, old, sloane, laboratory, and, his, home, a, little, exercise, between, work, and, dinner, and, one, might, occasionally, come, across, him, at, that, time, gibbs, did, supervise, the, doctoral, thesis, on, mathematical, economics, written, by, irving, fisher, in, 1891, after, gibbs, s, death, fisher, financed, the, publication, of, his, collected, works, another, distinguished, student, was, lee, de, forest, later, a, pioneer, of, radio, technology, gibbs, died, in, new, haven, on, april, 28, 1903, at, the, age, of, 64, the, victim, of, an, acute, intestinal, obstruction, a, funeral, was, conducted, two, days, later, at, his, home, on, 121, high, street, and, his, body, was, buried, in, the, nearby, grove, street, cemetery, in, may, yale, organized, a, memorial, meeting, at, the, sloane, laboratory, the, eminent, british, physicist, j, j, thomson, was, in, attendance, and, delivered, a, brief, address, gibbs, never, married, living, all, his, life, in, his, childhood, home, with, his, sister, julia, and, her, husband, addison, van, name, who, was, the, yale, librarian, except, for, his, customary, summer, vacations, in, the, adirondacks, at, keene, valley, new, york, and, later, at, the, white, mountains, in, intervale, new, hampshire, his, sojourn, in, europe, in, 1866, 69, was, almost, the, only, time, that, gibbs, spent, outside, new, haven, he, joined, yale, s, college, church, a, congregational, church, at, the, end, of, his, freshman, year, and, remained, a, regular, attendant, for, the, rest, of, his, life, gibbs, generally, voted, for, the, republican, candidate, in, presidential, elections, but, like, other, mugwumps, his, concern, over, the, growing, corruption, associated, with, machine, politics, led, him, to, support, grover, cleveland, a, conservative, democrat, in, the, election, of, 1884, little, else, is, known, of, his, religious, or, political, views, which, he, mostly, kept, to, himself, gibbs, did, not, produce, a, substantial, personal, correspondence, and, many, of, his, letters, were, later, lost, or, destroyed, beyond, the, technical, writings, concerning, his, research, he, published, only, two, other, pieces, a, brief, obituary, for, rudolf, clausius, one, of, the, founders, of, the, mathematical, theory, of, thermodynamics, and, a, longer, biographical, memoir, of, his, mentor, at, yale, h, a, newton, in, edward, bidwell, wilson, s, view, gibbs, was, not, an, advertiser, for, personal, renown, nor, a, propagandist, for, science, he, was, a, scholar, scion, of, an, old, scholarly, family, living, before, the, days, when, research, had, become, r, search, gibbs, was, not, a, freak, he, had, no, striking, ways, he, was, a, kindly, dignified, gentleman, according, to, lynde, wheeler, who, had, been, gibbs, s, student, at, yale, in, his, later, years, gibbs, was, always, neatly, dressed, usually, wore, a, felt, hat, on, the, street, and, never, exhibited, any, of, the, physical, mannerisms, or, eccentricities, sometimes, thought, to, be, inseparable, from, genius, his, manner, was, cordial, without, being, effusive, and, conveyed, clearly, the, innate, simplicity, and, sincerity, of, his, nature, he, was, a, careful, investor, and, financial, manager, and, at, his, death, in, 1903, his, estate, was, valued, at, 100, 000, roughly, 3, 39, million, today, for, many, years, he, served, as, trustee, secretary, and, treasurer, of, his, alma, mater, the, hopkins, school, us, president, chester, a, arthur, appointed, him, as, one, of, the, commissioners, to, the, national, conference, of, electricians, which, convened, in, philadelphia, in, september, 1884, and, gibbs, presided, over, one, of, its, sessions, a, keen, and, skilled, horseman, gibbs, was, seen, habitually, in, new, haven, driving, his, sister, s, carriage, in, an, obituary, published, in, the, american, journal, of, science, gibbs, s, former, student, henry, a, bumstead, referred, to, gibbs, s, personal, character, unassuming, in, manner, genial, and, kindly, in, his, intercourse, with, his, fellow, men, never, showing, impatience, or, irritation, devoid, of, personal, ambition, of, the, baser, sort, or, of, the, slightest, desire, to, exalt, himself, he, went, far, toward, realizing, the, ideal, of, the, unselfish, christian, gentleman, in, the, minds, of, those, who, knew, him, the, greatness, of, his, intellectual, achievements, will, never, overshadow, the, beauty, and, dignity, of, his, life, gibbs, s, papers, from, the, 1870s, introduced, the, idea, of, expressing, the, internal, energy, u, of, a, system, in, terms, of, the, entropy, s, in, addition, to, the, usual, state, variables, of, volume, v, pressure, p, and, temperature, t, he, also, introduced, the, concept, of, the, chemical, potential, displaystyle, mu, of, a, given, chemical, species, defined, to, be, the, rate, of, the, increase, in, u, associated, with, the, increase, in, the, number, n, of, molecules, of, that, species, at, constant, entropy, and, volume, thus, it, was, gibbs, who, first, combined, the, first, and, second, laws, of, thermodynamics, by, expressing, the, infinitesimal, change, in, the, internal, energy, d, u, of, a, closed, system, in, the, form, where, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, p, is, the, pressure, d, s, is, an, infinitesimal, change, in, entropy, and, d, v, is, an, infinitesimal, change, of, volume, the, last, term, is, the, sum, over, all, the, chemical, species, in, a, chemical, reaction, of, the, chemical, potential, i, of, the, i, th, species, multiplied, by, the, infinitesimal, change, in, the, number, of, moles, d, n, i, of, that, species, by, taking, the, legendre, transform, of, this, expression, he, defined, the, concepts, of, enthalpy, h, and, gibbs, free, energy, g, this, compares, to, the, expression, for, helmholtz, free, energy, a, when, the, gibbs, free, energy, for, a, chemical, reaction, is, negative, the, reaction, will, proceed, spontaneously, when, a, chemical, system, is, at, equilibrium, the, change, in, gibbs, free, energy, is, zero, an, equilibrium, constant, is, simply, related, to, the, free, energy, change, when, the, reactants, are, in, their, standard, states, chemical, potential, is, usually, defined, as, partial, molar, gibbs, free, energy, gibbs, also, obtained, what, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, gibbs, duhem, equation, in, an, electrochemical, reaction, characterized, by, an, electromotive, force, and, an, amount, of, transferred, charge, q, gibbs, s, starting, equation, becomes, the, publication, of, the, paper, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, 1874, 78, is, now, regarded, as, a, landmark, in, the, development, of, chemistry, in, it, gibbs, developed, a, rigorous, mathematical, theory, for, various, transport, phenomena, including, adsorption, electrochemistry, and, the, marangoni, effect, in, fluid, mixtures, he, also, formulated, the, phase, rule, for, the, number, f, of, variables, that, may, be, independently, controlled, in, an, equilibrium, mixture, of, c, components, existing, in, p, phases, phase, rule, is, very, useful, in, diverse, areas, such, as, metallurgy, mineralogy, and, petrology, it, can, also, be, applied, to, various, research, problems, in, physical, chemistry, together, with, james, clerk, maxwell, and, ludwig, boltzmann, gibbs, founded, statistical, mechanics, a, term, that, he, coined, to, identify, the, branch, of, theoretical, physics, that, accounts, for, the, observed, thermodynamic, properties, of, systems, in, terms, of, the, statistics, of, ensembles, of, all, possible, physical, states, of, a, system, composed, of, many, particles, he, introduced, the, concept, of, phase, of, a, mechanical, system, he, used, the, concept, to, define, the, microcanonical, canonical, and, grand, canonical, ensembles, all, related, to, the, gibbs, measure, thus, obtaining, a, more, general, formulation, of, the, statistical, properties, of, many, particle, systems, than, maxwell, and, boltzmann, had, achieved, before, him, gibbs, generalized, boltzmann, s, statistical, interpretation, of, entropy, s, displaystyle, s, by, defining, the, entropy, of, an, arbitrary, ensemble, as, where, k, b, displaystyle, k, text, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, while, the, sum, is, over, all, possible, microstates, i, displaystyle, i, with, p, i, displaystyle, p, i, the, corresponding, probability, of, the, microstate, see, gibbs, entropy, formula, this, same, formula, would, later, play, a, central, role, in, claude, shannon, s, information, theory, and, is, therefore, often, seen, as, the, basis, of, the, modern, information, theoretical, interpretation, of, thermodynamics, according, to, henri, poincar, writing, in, 1904, even, though, maxwell, and, boltzmann, had, previously, explained, the, irreversibility, of, macroscopic, physical, processes, in, probabilistic, terms, the, one, who, has, seen, it, most, clearly, in, a, book, too, little, read, because, it, is, a, little, difficult, to, read, is, gibbs, in, his, elementary, principles, of, statistical, mechanics, gibbs, s, analysis, of, irreversibility, and, his, formulation, of, boltzmann, s, h, theorem, and, of, the, ergodic, hypothesis, were, major, influences, on, the, mathematical, physics, of, the, 20th, century, gibbs, was, well, aware, that, the, application, of, the, equipartition, theorem, to, large, systems, of, classical, particles, failed, to, explain, the, measurements, of, the, specific, heats, of, both, solids, and, gases, and, he, argued, that, this, was, evidence, of, the, danger, of, basing, thermodynamics, on, hypotheses, about, the, constitution, of, matter, gibbs, s, own, framework, for, statistical, mechanics, based, on, ensembles, of, macroscopically, indistinguishable, microstates, could, be, carried, over, almost, intact, after, the, discovery, that, the, microscopic, laws, of, nature, obey, quantum, rules, rather, than, the, classical, laws, known, to, gibbs, and, to, his, contemporaries, his, resolution, of, the, so, called, gibbs, paradox, about, the, entropy, of, the, mixing, of, gases, is, now, often, cited, as, a, prefiguration, of, the, indistinguishability, of, particles, required, by, quantum, physics, british, scientists, including, maxwell, had, relied, on, hamilton, s, quaternions, in, order, to, express, the, dynamics, of, physical, quantities, like, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, having, both, a, magnitude, and, a, direction, in, three, dimensional, space, following, w, k, clifford, in, his, elements, of, dynamic, 1888, gibbs, noted, that, the, product, of, quaternions, could, be, separated, into, two, parts, a, one, dimensional, scalar, quantity, and, a, three, dimensional, vector, so, that, the, use, of, quaternions, involved, mathematical, complications, and, redundancies, that, could, be, avoided, in, the, interest, of, simplicity, and, to, facilitate, teaching, in, his, yale, classroom, notes, he, defined, distinct, dot, and, cross, products, for, pairs, of, vectors, and, introduced, the, now, common, notation, for, them, through, the, 1901, textbook, vector, analysis, prepared, by, e, b, wilson, from, gibbs, notes, he, was, largely, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, vector, calculus, techniques, still, used, today, in, electrodynamics, and, fluid, mechanics, while, he, was, working, on, vector, analysis, in, the, late, 1870s, gibbs, discovered, that, his, approach, was, similar, to, the, one, that, grassmann, had, taken, in, his, multiple, algebra, gibbs, then, sought, to, publicize, grassmann, s, work, stressing, that, it, was, both, more, general, and, historically, prior, to, hamilton, s, quaternionic, algebra, to, establish, priority, of, grassmann, s, ideas, gibbs, convinced, grassmann, s, heirs, to, seek, the, publication, in, germany, of, the, essay, theorie, der, ebbe, und, flut, on, tides, that, grassmann, had, submitted, in, 1840, to, the, faculty, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, which, he, had, first, introduced, the, notion, of, what, would, later, be, called, a, vector, space, linear, space, as, gibbs, had, advocated, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, quaternions, were, eventually, all, but, abandoned, by, physicists, in, favor, of, the, vectorial, approach, developed, by, him, and, independently, by, oliver, heaviside, gibbs, applied, his, vector, methods, to, the, determination, of, planetary, and, comet, orbits, 160, he, also, developed, the, concept, of, mutually, reciprocal, triads, of, vectors, that, later, proved, to, be, of, importance, in, crystallography, though, gibbs, s, research, on, physical, optics, is, less, well, known, today, than, his, other, work, it, made, a, significant, contribution, to, classical, electromagnetism, by, applying, maxwell, s, equations, to, the, theory, of, optical, processes, such, as, birefringence, dispersion, and, optical, activity, in, that, work, gibbs, showed, that, those, processes, could, be, accounted, for, by, maxwell, s, equations, without, any, special, assumptions, about, the, microscopic, structure, of, matter, or, about, the, nature, of, the, medium, in, which, electromagnetic, waves, were, supposed, to, propagate, the, so, called, luminiferous, ether, gibbs, also, stressed, that, the, absence, of, a, longitudinal, electromagnetic, wave, which, is, needed, to, account, for, the, observed, properties, of, light, is, automatically, guaranteed, by, maxwell, s, equations, by, virtue, of, what, is, now, called, their, gauge, invariance, whereas, in, mechanical, theories, of, light, such, as, lord, kelvin, s, it, must, be, imposed, as, an, ad, hoc, condition, on, the, properties, of, the, aether, in, his, last, paper, on, physical, optics, gibbs, concluded, that, it, may, be, said, for, the, electrical, theory, that, it, is, not, obliged, to, invent, hypotheses, but, only, to, apply, the, laws, furnished, by, the, science, of, electricity, and, that, it, is, difficult, to, account, for, the, coincidences, between, the, electrical, and, optical, properties, of, media, unless, we, regard, the, motions, of, light, as, electrical, shortly, afterwards, the, electromagnetic, nature, of, light, was, demonstrated, by, the, experiments, of, heinrich, hertz, in, germany, gibbs, worked, at, a, time, when, there, was, little, tradition, of, rigorous, theoretical, science, in, the, united, states, his, research, was, not, easily, understandable, to, his, students, or, his, colleagues, and, he, made, no, effort, to, popularize, his, ideas, or, to, simplify, their, exposition, to, make, them, more, accessible, his, seminal, work, on, thermodynamics, was, published, mostly, in, the, transactions, of, the, connecticut, academy, a, journal, edited, by, his, librarian, brother, in, law, which, was, little, read, in, the, us, and, even, less, so, in, europe, when, gibbs, submitted, his, long, paper, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, to, the, academy, both, elias, loomis, and, h, a, newton, protested, that, they, did, not, understand, gibbs, s, work, at, all, but, they, helped, to, raise, the, money, needed, to, pay, for, the, typesetting, of, the, many, mathematical, symbols, in, the, paper, several, yale, faculty, members, as, well, as, business, and, professional, men, in, new, haven, contributed, funds, for, that, purpose, even, though, it, had, been, immediately, embraced, by, maxwell, gibbs, s, graphical, formulation, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, came, into, widespread, use, only, in, the, mid, 20th, century, with, the, work, of, l, szl, tisza, and, herbert, callen, according, to, james, gerald, crowther, in, his, later, years, was, a, tall, dignified, gentleman, with, a, healthy, stride, and, ruddy, complexion, performing, his, share, of, household, chores, approachable, and, kind, if, unintelligible, to, students, gibbs, was, highly, esteemed, by, his, friends, but, american, science, was, too, preoccupied, with, practical, questions, to, make, much, use, of, his, profound, theoretical, work, during, his, lifetime, he, lived, out, his, quiet, life, at, yale, deeply, admired, by, a, few, able, students, but, making, no, immediate, impress, on, american, science, commensurate, with, his, genius, on, the, other, hand, gibbs, did, receive, the, major, honors, then, possible, for, an, academic, scientist, in, the, us, he, was, elected, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1879, and, received, the, 1880, rumford, prize, from, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, for, his, work, on, chemical, thermodynamics, in, 1895, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1895, he, was, also, awarded, honorary, doctorates, by, princeton, university, and, williams, college, in, europe, gibbs, was, inducted, as, honorary, member, of, the, london, mathematical, society, in, 1892, and, elected, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, in, 1897, he, was, elected, as, corresponding, member, of, the, prussian, and, french, academies, of, science, and, received, honorary, doctorates, from, the, universities, of, dublin, erlangen, and, christiania, now, oslo, the, royal, society, further, honored, gibbs, in, 1901, with, the, copley, medal, then, regarded, as, the, highest, international, award, in, the, natural, sciences, noting, that, he, had, been, the, first, to, apply, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, to, the, exhaustive, discussion, of, the, relation, between, chemical, electrical, and, thermal, energy, and, capacity, for, external, work, gibbs, who, remained, in, new, haven, was, represented, at, the, award, ceremony, by, commander, richardson, clover, the, us, naval, attach, in, london, in, his, autobiography, mathematician, gian, carlo, rota, tells, of, casually, browsing, the, mathematical, stacks, of, sterling, library, and, stumbling, on, a, handwritten, mailing, list, attached, to, some, of, gibbs, s, course, notes, which, listed, over, two, hundred, notable, scientists, of, his, day, including, poincar, boltzmann, david, hilbert, and, ernst, mach, from, this, rota, concluded, that, gibbs, s, work, was, better, known, among, the, scientific, elite, of, his, day, than, the, published, material, suggests, lynde, wheeler, reproduces, that, mailing, list, in, an, appendix, to, his, biography, of, gibbs, that, gibbs, succeeded, in, interesting, his, european, correspondents, in, his, work, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, his, monograph, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, was, translated, into, german, then, the, leading, language, for, chemistry, by, wilhelm, ostwald, in, 1892, and, into, french, by, henri, louis, le, ch, telier, in, 1899, gibbs, s, most, immediate, and, obvious, influence, was, on, physical, chemistry, and, statistical, mechanics, two, disciplines, which, he, greatly, helped, to, found, during, gibbs, s, lifetime, his, phase, rule, was, experimentally, validated, by, dutch, chemist, h, w, bakhuis, roozeboom, who, showed, how, to, apply, it, in, a, variety, of, situations, thereby, assuring, it, of, widespread, use, in, industrial, chemistry, gibbs, s, thermodynamics, found, many, applications, during, the, early, 20th, century, from, electrochemistry, to, the, development, of, the, haber, process, for, the, synthesis, of, ammonia, when, dutch, physicist, j, d, van, der, waals, received, the, 1910, nobel, prize, for, his, work, on, the, equation, of, state, for, gases, and, liquids, he, acknowledged, the, great, influence, of, gibbs, s, work, on, that, subject, max, planck, received, the, 1918, nobel, prize, for, his, work, on, quantum, mechanics, particularly, his, 1900, paper, on, planck, s, law, for, quantized, black, body, radiation, that, work, was, based, largely, on, the, thermodynamics, of, kirchhoff, boltzmann, and, gibbs, planck, declared, that, gibbs, s, name, not, only, in, america, but, in, the, whole, world, will, ever, be, reckoned, among, the, most, renowned, theoretical, physicists, of, all, times, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, publication, of, two, influential, textbooks, that, soon, came, to, be, regarded, as, founding, documents, of, chemical, thermodynamics, both, of, which, used, and, extended, gibbs, s, work, in, that, field, these, were, thermodynamics, and, the, free, energy, of, chemical, processes, 1923, by, gilbert, n, lewis, and, merle, randall, and, modern, thermodynamics, by, the, methods, of, willard, gibbs, 1933, by, edward, a, guggenheim, gibbs, s, work, on, statistical, ensembles, as, presented, in, his, 1902, textbook, has, had, a, great, impact, in, both, theoretical, physics, and, in, pure, mathematics, according, to, mathematical, physicist, arthur, wightman, it, is, one, of, the, striking, features, of, the, work, of, gibbs, noticed, by, every, student, of, thermodynamics, and, statistical, mechanics, that, his, formulations, of, physical, concepts, were, so, felicitously, chosen, that, they, have, survived, 100, years, of, turbulent, development, in, theoretical, physics, and, mathematics, initially, unaware, of, gibbs, s, contributions, in, that, field, albert, einstein, wrote, three, papers, on, statistical, mechanics, published, between, 1902, and, 1904, after, reading, gibbs, s, textbook, which, was, translated, into, german, by, ernst, zermelo, in, 1905, einstein, declared, that, gibbs, s, treatment, was, superior, to, his, own, and, explained, that, he, would, not, have, written, those, papers, if, he, had, known, gibbs, s, work, gibbs, s, early, papers, on, the, use, of, graphical, methods, in, thermodynamics, reflect, a, powerfully, original, understanding, of, what, mathematicians, would, later, call, convex, analysis, including, ideas, that, according, to, barry, simon, lay, dormant, for, about, seventy, five, years, important, mathematical, concepts, based, on, gibbs, s, work, on, thermodynamics, and, statistical, mechanics, include, the, gibbs, lemma, in, game, theory, the, gibbs, inequality, in, information, theory, as, well, as, gibbs, sampling, in, computational, statistics, the, development, of, vector, calculus, was, gibbs, s, other, great, contribution, to, mathematics, the, publication, in, 1901, of, e, b, wilson, s, textbook, vector, analysis, based, on, gibbs, s, lectures, at, yale, did, much, to, propagate, the, use, of, vectorial, methods, and, notation, in, both, mathematics, and, theoretical, physics, definitively, displacing, the, quaternions, that, had, until, then, been, dominant, in, the, scientific, literature, at, yale, gibbs, was, also, mentor, to, lee, de, forest, who, went, on, to, invent, the, triode, amplifier, and, has, been, called, the, father, of, radio, de, forest, credited, gibbs, s, influence, for, the, realization, that, the, leaders, in, electrical, development, would, be, those, who, pursued, the, higher, theory, of, waves, and, oscillations, and, the, transmission, by, these, means, of, intelligence, and, power, another, student, of, gibbs, who, played, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, radio, technology, was, lynde, wheeler, gibbs, also, had, an, indirect, influence, on, mathematical, economics, he, supervised, the, thesis, of, irving, fisher, who, received, the, first, phd, in, economics, from, yale, in, 1891, in, that, work, published, in, 1892, as, mathematical, investigations, in, the, theory, of, value, and, prices, fisher, drew, a, direct, analogy, between, gibbsian, equilibrium, in, physical, and, chemical, systems, and, the, general, equilibrium, of, markets, and, he, used, gibbs, s, vectorial, notation, gibbs, s, prot, g, edwin, bidwell, wilson, became, in, turn, a, mentor, to, leading, american, economist, and, nobel, laureate, paul, samuelson, in, 1947, samuelson, published, foundations, of, economic, analysis, based, on, his, doctoral, dissertation, in, which, he, used, as, epigraph, a, remark, attributed, to, gibbs, mathematics, is, a, language, samuelson, later, explained, that, in, his, understanding, of, prices, his, debts, were, not, primarily, to, pareto, or, slutsky, but, to, the, great, thermodynamicist, willard, gibbs, of, yale, mathematician, norbert, wiener, cited, gibbs, s, use, of, probability, in, the, formulation, of, statistical, mechanics, as, the, first, great, revolution, of, twentieth, century, physics, and, as, a, major, influence, on, his, conception, of, cybernetics, wiener, explained, in, the, preface, to, his, book, the, human, use, of, human, beings, that, it, was, devoted, to, the, impact, of, the, gibbsian, point, of, view, on, modern, life, both, through, the, substantive, changes, it, has, made, to, working, science, and, through, the, changes, it, has, made, indirectly, in, our, attitude, to, life, in, general, when, the, german, physical, chemist, walther, nernst, visited, yale, in, 1906, to, give, the, silliman, lecture, he, was, surprised, to, find, no, tangible, memorial, for, gibbs, nernst, donated, his, 500, lecture, fee, to, the, university, to, help, pay, for, a, suitable, monument, this, was, finally, unveiled, in, 1912, in, the, form, of, a, bronze, bas, relief, by, sculptor, lee, lawrie, installed, in, the, sloane, physics, laboratory, in, 1910, the, american, chemical, society, established, the, willard, gibbs, award, for, eminent, work, in, pure, or, applied, chemistry, in, 1923, the, american, mathematical, society, endowed, the, josiah, willard, gibbs, lectureship, to, show, the, public, some, idea, of, the, aspects, of, mathematics, and, its, applications, in, 1945, yale, university, created, the, j, willard, gibbs, professorship, in, theoretical, chemistry, held, until, 1973, by, lars, onsager, onsager, who, much, like, gibbs, focused, on, applying, new, mathematical, ideas, to, problems, in, physical, chemistry, won, the, 1968, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, addition, to, establishing, the, josiah, willard, gibbs, laboratories, and, the, j, willard, gibbs, assistant, professorship, in, mathematics, yale, has, also, hosted, two, symposia, dedicated, to, gibbs, s, life, and, work, one, in, 1989, and, another, on, the, centenary, of, his, death, in, 2003, rutgers, university, endowed, a, j, willard, gibbs, professorship, of, thermomechanics, held, as, of, 2014, by, bernard, coleman, gibbs, was, elected, in, 1950, to, the, hall, of, fame, for, great, americans, the, oceanographic, research, ship, usns, josiah, willard, gibbs, t, agor, 1, was, in, service, with, the, united, states, navy, from, 1958, to, 1971, gibbs, crater, near, the, eastern, limb, of, the, moon, was, named, in, the, scientist, s, honor, in, 1964, edward, guggenheim, introduced, the, symbol, g, for, the, gibbs, free, energy, in, 1933, and, this, was, used, also, by, dirk, ter, haar, in, 1966, this, notation, is, now, universal, and, is, recommended, by, the, iupac, in, 1960, william, giauque, and, others, suggested, the, name, gibbs, abbreviated, gbs, for, the, unit, of, entropy, calorie, per, kelvin, but, this, usage, did, not, become, common, and, the, corresponding, si, unit, joule, per, kelvin, carries, no, special, name, in, 1954, a, year, before, his, death, albert, einstein, was, asked, by, an, interviewer, who, were, the, greatest, thinkers, that, he, had, known, einstein, replied, lorentz, adding, i, never, met, willard, gibbs, perhaps, had, i, done, so, i, might, have, placed, him, beside, lorentz, author, bill, bryson, in, his, bestselling, popular, science, book, a, short, history, of, nearly, everything, ranks, gibbs, as, perhaps, the, most, brilliant, person, that, most, people, have, never, heard, of, in, 1958, uss, san, carlos, was, renamed, usns, josiah, willard, gibbs, and, re, designated, as, an, oceanographic, research, ship, in, 1909, the, american, historian, and, novelist, henry, adams, finished, an, essay, entitled, the, rule, of, phase, applied, to, history, in, which, he, sought, to, apply, gibbs, s, phase, rule, and, other, thermodynamic, concepts, to, a, general, theory, of, human, history, william, james, henry, bumstead, and, others, criticized, both, adams, s, tenuous, grasp, of, the, scientific, concepts, that, he, invoked, as, well, as, the, arbitrariness, of, his, application, of, those, concepts, as, metaphors, for, the, evolution, of, human, thought, and, society, the, essay, remained, unpublished, until, it, appeared, posthumously, in, 1919, in, the, degradation, of, the, democratic, dogma, edited, by, henry, adams, s, younger, brother, brooks, in, the, 1930s, feminist, poet, muriel, rukeyser, became, fascinated, by, willard, gibbs, and, wrote, a, long, poem, about, his, life, and, work, gibbs, included, in, the, collection, a, turning, wind, published, in, 1939, as, well, as, a, book, length, biography, willard, gibbs, 1942, according, to, rukeyser, willard, gibbs, is, the, type, of, the, imagination, at, work, in, the, world, his, story, is, that, of, an, opening, up, which, has, had, its, effect, on, our, lives, and, our, thinking, and, it, seems, to, me, it, is, the, emblem, of, the, naked, imagination, which, is, called, abstract, and, impractical, but, whose, discoveries, can, be, used, by, anyone, who, is, interested, in, whatever, field, an, imagination, which, for, me, more, than, that, of, any, other, figure, in, american, thought, any, poet, or, political, or, religious, figure, stands, for, imagination, at, its, essential, points, in, 1946, fortune, magazine, illustrated, a, cover, story, on, fundamental, science, with, a, representation, of, the, thermodynamic, surface, that, maxwell, had, built, based, on, gibbs, s, proposal, rukeyser, called, this, surface, a, statue, of, water, and, the, magazine, saw, in, it, the, abstract, creation, of, a, great, american, scientist, that, lends, itself, to, the, symbolism, of, contemporary, art, forms, the, artwork, by, arthur, lidov, also, included, gibbs, s, mathematical, expression, of, the, phase, rule, for, heterogeneous, mixtures, as, well, as, a, radar, screen, an, oscilloscope, waveform, newton, s, apple, and, a, small, rendition, of, a, three, dimensional, phase, diagram, gibbs, s, nephew, ralph, gibbs, van, name, a, professor, of, physical, chemistry, at, yale, was, unhappy, with, rukeyser, s, biography, in, part, because, of, her, lack, of, scientific, training, van, name, had, withheld, the, family, papers, from, her, and, after, her, book, was, published, in, 1942, to, positive, literary, but, mixed, scientific, reviews, he, tried, to, encourage, gibbs, s, former, students, to, produce, a, more, technically, oriented, biography, rukeyser, s, approach, to, gibbs, was, also, sharply, criticized, by, gibbs, s, former, student, and, prot, g, edwin, wilson, with, van, name, s, and, wilson, s, encouragement, physicist, lynde, wheeler, published, a, new, biography, of, gibbs, in, 1951, both, gibbs, and, rukeyser, s, biography, of, him, figure, prominently, in, the, poetry, collection, true, north, 1997, by, stephanie, strickland, in, fiction, gibbs, appears, as, the, mentor, to, character, kit, traverse, in, thomas, pynchon, s, novel, against, the, day, 2006, that, novel, also, prominently, discusses, the, birefringence, of, iceland, spar, an, optical, phenomenon, that, gibbs, investigated, in, 2005, the, united, states, postal, service, issued, the, american, scientists, commemorative, postage, stamp, series, designed, by, artist, victor, stabin, depicting, gibbs, john, von, neumann, barbara, mcclintock, and, richard, feynman, the, first, day, of, issue, ceremony, for, the, series, was, held, on, may, 4, at, yale, university, s, luce, hall, and, was, attended, by, john, marburger, scientific, advisor, to, the, president, of, the, united, states, rick, levin, president, of, yale, and, family, members, of, the, scientists, honored, including, physician, john, w, gibbs, a, distant, cousin, of, willard, gibbs, kenneth, r, jolls, a, professor, of, chemical, engineering, at, iowa, state, university, and, an, expert, on, graphical, methods, in, thermodynamics, consulted, on, the, design, of, the, stamp, honoring, gibbs, the, stamp, identifies, gibbs, as, a, thermodynamicist, and, features, a, diagram, from, the, 4th, edition, of, maxwell, s, theory, of, heat, published, in, 1875, which, illustrates, gibbs, s, thermodynamic, surface, for, water, microprinting, on, the, collar, of, gibbs, s, portrait, depicts, his, original, mathematical, equation, for, the, change, in, the, energy, of, a, substance, in, terms, of, its, entropy, and, the, other, state, variables, gibbs, s, other, papers, are, included, in, both
