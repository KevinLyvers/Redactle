guillaume, du, fay, dj, u, f, a, dyoo, feye, french, also, dufay, du, fayt, 5, august, 1397, 27, november, 1474, was, a, composer, and, music, theorist, of, early, renaissance, music, who, is, variously, described, as, french, or, franco, flemish, considered, the, leading, european, composer, of, his, time, his, music, was, widely, performed, and, reproduced, du, fay, was, well, associated, with, composers, of, the, burgundian, school, particularly, his, colleague, gilles, binchois, but, was, never, a, regular, member, of, the, burgundian, chapel, himself, while, he, is, among, the, best, documented, composers, of, his, time, du, fay, s, birth, and, family, is, shrouded, with, uncertainty, though, he, was, probably, the, illegitimate, child, of, a, priest, he, was, educated, at, cambrai, cathedral, where, his, teachers, included, nicolas, grenon, and, richard, loqueville, among, others, for, the, next, decade, du, fay, worked, throughout, europe, as, a, subdeacon, in, cambrai, under, carlo, i, malatesta, in, rimini, for, the, house, of, malatesta, in, pesaro, and, under, louis, aleman, in, bologna, where, he, was, ordained, priest, as, his, fame, began, to, spread, he, settled, in, rome, in, 1428, as, musician, of, the, prestigious, papal, choir, first, under, pope, martin, v, and, then, pope, eugene, iv, where, he, wrote, the, motets, balsamus, et, munda, cera, ecclesie, militantis, and, supremum, est, mortalibus, amid, rome, s, finical, and, political, disorder, in, the, 1430s, du, fay, took, a, leave, of, absence, from, the, choir, to, serve, amadeus, viii, duke, of, savoy, du, fay, returned, to, italy, in, 1436, writing, his, most, admired, work, the, complex, motet, nuper, rosarum, flores, which, celebrated, the, consecration, of, filippo, brunelleschi, s, dome, for, the, florence, cathedral, he, later, joined, the, recently, moved, papal, court, in, bologna, and, was, associated, with, the, house, of, este, in, ferrara, for, the, next, eleven, years, du, fay, was, in, cambrai, serving, philip, the, good, under, whom, he, may, have, written, now, lost, works, on, music, theory, after, a, brief, return, to, both, savoy, and, italy, du, fay, settled, in, cambrai, in, 1458, where, his, focus, shifted, from, song, and, motet, to, composing, english, inspired, cyclic, masses, based, on, cantus, firmus, such, as, the, missa, ave, regina, celorum, the, missa, ecce, ancilla, domini, the, missa, l, homme, arm, and, the, missa, se, la, face, ay, pale, during, his, final, years, in, cambrai, du, fay, wrote, his, now, lost, requiem, and, both, met, and, influenced, the, leading, musicians, of, his, time, including, antoine, busnois, loyset, comp, re, johannes, tinctoris, and, particularly, johannes, ockeghem, du, fay, has, been, described, as, leading, the, first, generation, of, european, musicians, who, were, primarily, considered, composers, by, occupation, his, erratic, career, took, him, throughout, western, europe, forming, a, cosmopolitan, style, and, an, extensive, oeuvre, which, included, representatives, of, virtually, every, polyphonic, genre, of, his, time, like, binchois, du, fay, was, deeply, influenced, by, the, contenance, angloise, style, of, john, dunstaple, and, synthesized, it, with, a, wide, variety, of, other, styles, including, that, of, the, famous, missa, caput, and, the, techniques, of, his, younger, contemporaries, ockeghem, and, busnois, du, fay, s, life, is, better, documented, than, almost, any, other, composer, of, the, 15th, century, the, reasons, for, this, are, numerous, but, especially, informative, are, the, thorough, record, keeping, of, the, institutions, he, associated, with, and, the, many, biographical, or, historical, anecdotes, integrated, in, his, compositions, in, addition, while, records, from, many, northern, french, cathedrals, were, either, lost, or, destroyed, those, from, cambrai, cathedral, remain, extant, modern, scholarship, generally, spells, the, composer, s, surname, as, two, words, du, fay, before, the, late, 20th, century, however, spelling, the, name, as, single, word, dufay, was, much, more, common, archival, discoveries, from, this, period, revealed, that, the, surname, was, usually, spelled, as, two, words, in, documents, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, contrary, to, musical, sources, of, that, time, it, seems, that, du, fay, s, parents, spelt, their, surname, as, du, fayt, but, for, unknown, reasons, the, composer, altered, the, spelling, while, active, in, italy, documents, from, the, composer, s, early, years, in, cambrai, sometimes, spelled, his, first, name, as, willaume, or, a, related, form, such, as, willermus, willem, or, wilhelm, from, the, evidence, of, his, will, he, was, probably, born, in, beersel, in, the, vicinity, of, brussels, the, illegitimate, child, of, an, unknown, priest, and, a, woman, named, marie, du, fayt, she, moved, with, her, son, to, cambrai, early, in, his, life, staying, with, a, relative, who, was, a, canon, of, the, cathedral, there, the, link, between, the, du, fay, family, and, the, cathedral, of, cambrai, is, the, sole, reason, a, large, amount, of, information, is, known, about, du, fay, s, early, life, as, the, institute, kept, detailed, records, on, all, affiliated, persons, his, musical, gifts, were, noticed, by, the, cathedral, authorities, who, evidently, gave, him, a, thorough, training, in, music, he, studied, with, rogier, de, hesdin, during, the, summer, of, 1409, and, he, was, listed, as, a, choirboy, in, the, cathedral, from, 1409, to, 1412, during, those, years, he, studied, with, nicolas, malin, and, the, authorities, must, have, been, impressed, with, the, boy, s, gifts, because, they, gave, him, his, own, copy, of, villedieu, s, doctrinale, puerorum, in, 1411, a, highly, unusual, event, for, one, so, young, in, june, 1414, aged, around, 16, he, had, already, been, given, a, benefice, as, chaplain, at, st, g, ry, immediately, adjacent, to, cambrai, where, he, studied, under, nicolas, malin, and, richard, loqueville, later, that, year, on, the, evidence, of, music, composed, and, a, later, relationship, with, the, malatesta, court, members, of, which, he, met, on, the, trip, he, probably, went, to, the, council, of, konstanz, he, likely, stayed, there, until, 1418, at, which, time, he, returned, to, cambrai, from, november, 1418, to, 1420, he, was, a, subdeacon, at, cambrai, cathedral, in, 1420, he, left, cambrai, for, italy, first, to, rimini, and, then, to, pesaro, where, he, worked, for, the, malatesta, family, several, of, his, compositions, can, be, dated, to, this, period, they, contain, colloquial, references, to, italy, there, he, met, the, composers, hugo, and, arnold, de, lantins, who, were, also, among, the, musicians, of, the, malatesta, household, in, 1424, du, fay, returned, to, cambrai, because, of, the, illness, and, subsequent, death, of, the, relative, with, whom, his, mother, was, staying, by, 1426, however, he, had, returned, to, italy, in, bologna, he, entered, the, service, of, cardinal, louis, aleman, the, papal, legate, while, in, bologna, he, became, a, deacon, and, by, 1428, he, was, ordained, priest, cardinal, aleman, was, driven, from, bologna, by, the, rival, canedoli, family, in, 1428, and, du, fay, also, left, going, to, rome, he, became, a, member, of, the, papal, choir, the, most, prestigious, musical, establishment, in, europe, serving, first, pope, martin, v, and, then, after, the, death, of, pope, martin, in, 1431, pope, eugene, iv, by, this, time, his, fame, had, spread, and, he, had, become, one, of, the, most, respected, musicians, in, europe, as, a, consequence, honors, in, the, form, of, benefices, came, to, him, from, churches, in, his, homeland, in, 1434, he, was, appointed, maistre, de, chappelle, in, savoy, where, he, served, duke, am, d, e, viii, he, had, left, rome, because, of, a, crisis, in, the, finances, of, the, papal, choir, while, seeking, to, escape, the, turbulence, and, uncertainty, during, the, struggle, between, the, papacy, and, the, council, of, basel, by, 1435, he, was, again, in, the, service, of, the, papal, chapel, but, this, time, it, was, in, florence, pope, eugene, having, been, driven, from, rome, in, 1434, by, the, establishment, of, an, insurrectionary, republic, there, sympathetic, to, the, council, of, basel, and, the, conciliar, movement, in, 1436, du, fay, composed, the, festive, motet, nuper, rosarum, flores, one, of, his, most, famous, compositions, dedicated, to, and, performed, at, the, cathedral, of, santa, maria, del, fiore, in, florence, featuring, filippo, brunelleschi, s, renowned, dome, eugene, at, this, time, lived, in, exile, at, the, nearby, church, of, santa, maria, novella, the, papal, court, moved, to, bologna, in, april, 1436, and, by, 10, may, 1437, du, fay, was, in, possession, of, a, university, law, degree, since, there, is, no, evidence, that, du, fay, had, studied, law, at, bologna, it, is, likely, that, the, degree, was, granted, by, papal, fiat, in, september, 1436, du, fay, achieved, what, he, had, long, sought, for, a, lucrative, benefice, near, the, place, of, his, birth, a, certain, jehan, vivien, went, on, to, become, the, bishop, of, nevers, vacating, his, canonicate, at, cambrai, in, the, process, and, du, fay, was, given, vivien, s, canonicate, by, both, motu, proprio, and, papal, bull, although, the, law, degree, was, not, necessary, in, holding, the, canonicate, at, cambrai, du, fay, regarded, both, titles, important, enough, to, be, mentioned, in, his, funeral, monument, during, this, period, du, fay, also, began, his, long, association, with, the, este, family, in, ferrara, some, of, the, most, important, musical, patrons, of, the, renaissance, and, with, which, he, probably, had, become, acquainted, during, the, days, of, his, association, with, the, malatesta, family, rimini, and, ferrara, are, not, only, geographically, close, but, the, two, families, were, related, by, marriage, and, du, fay, composed, at, least, one, ballade, for, niccol, iii, marquis, of, ferrara, in, 1437, du, fay, visited, the, town, when, niccol, died, in, 1441, the, next, marquis, maintained, the, contact, with, du, fay, and, not, only, continued, financial, support, for, the, composer, but, copied, and, distributed, some, of, his, music, the, struggle, between, the, papacy, and, the, council, of, basel, continued, through, the, 1430s, and, evidently, du, fay, realised, that, his, own, position, might, be, threatened, by, the, spreading, conflict, especially, since, pope, eugene, was, deposed, in, 1439, by, the, council, and, replaced, by, duke, am, d, e, of, savoy, himself, as, pope, antipope, felix, v, at, this, time, du, fay, returned, to, his, homeland, arriving, in, cambrai, by, december, of, that, year, one, of, the, first, documents, mentioning, him, in, cambrai, is, dated, 27, december, 1440, when, he, received, a, delivery, of, 36, lots, of, wine, for, the, feast, of, st, john, the, evangelist, du, fay, was, to, remain, in, cambrai, through, the, 1440s, and, during, this, time, he, was, also, in, the, service, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, while, in, cambrai, he, collaborated, with, nicolas, grenon, on, a, complete, revision, of, the, liturgical, musical, collection, of, the, cathedral, which, included, writing, an, extensive, collection, of, polyphonic, music, for, services, in, addition, to, his, musical, work, he, was, active, in, the, general, administration, of, the, cathedral, in, 1444, his, mother, marie, died, and, was, buried, in, the, cathedral, and, in, 1445, du, fay, moved, into, the, house, of, the, previous, canon, which, was, to, remain, his, primary, residence, for, the, rest, of, his, life, planchart, speculates, that, around, this, time, du, fay, might, have, written, his, works, on, music, theory, both, of, which, are, lost, after, the, abdication, of, the, last, antipope, felix, v, in, 1449, his, own, former, employer, duke, am, d, e, viii, of, savoy, the, struggle, between, different, factions, within, the, church, began, to, heal, and, du, fay, once, again, left, cambrai, for, points, south, he, went, to, turin, in, 1450, shortly, before, the, death, of, duke, am, d, e, but, returned, to, cambrai, later, that, year, and, in, 1452, he, went, back, to, savoy, yet, again, this, time, he, did, not, return, to, cambrai, for, six, years, and, during, that, time, he, attempted, to, find, either, a, benefice, or, an, employment, which, would, allow, him, to, stay, in, italy, numerous, compositions, including, one, of, the, four, lamentationes, that, he, composed, on, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, his, famous, mass, based, on, se, la, face, ay, pale, as, well, as, a, letter, to, lorenzo, de, medici, survive, from, this, period, but, as, he, was, unable, to, find, a, satisfactory, position, for, his, retirement, he, returned, north, in, 1458, while, in, savoy, he, served, more, or, less, officially, as, choirmaster, for, louis, duke, of, savoy, but, he, was, more, likely, in, a, ceremonial, role, since, the, records, of, the, chapel, never, mention, him, when, he, returned, to, cambrai, for, his, final, years, he, was, appointed, canon, of, the, cathedral, he, was, now, the, most, renowned, composer, in, europe, once, again, he, established, close, ties, to, the, court, of, burgundy, and, continued, to, compose, music, for, them, in, addition, he, received, many, visitors, including, busnois, ockeghem, tinctoris, and, loyset, comp, re, all, of, whom, were, decisive, in, the, development, of, the, polyphonic, style, of, the, next, generation, during, this, period, he, probably, wrote, his, mass, based, on, the, popular, l, homme, arm, tune, and, he, may, be, the, author, of, the, chanson, il, sera, par, vous, l, homme, arm, which, uses, the, same, cantus, firmus, the, latter, composition, may, have, been, inspired, by, philip, the, good, s, call, for, a, new, crusade, against, the, turks, who, had, recently, captured, constantinople, he, also, wrote, a, requiem, mass, around, 1460, which, is, lost, after, an, illness, of, several, weeks, du, fay, died, on, 27, november, 1474, he, had, requested, that, his, motet, ave, regina, celorum, be, sung, for, him, at, his, deathbed, but, time, was, insufficient, for, this, to, be, arranged, instead, his, now, lost, requiem, mass, was, performed, during, his, funeral, service, du, fay, was, buried, in, the, chapel, of, st, tienne, in, the, cathedral, of, cambrai, his, portrait, was, carved, onto, his, tombstone, after, the, destruction, of, the, cathedral, during, the, french, revolution, the, tombstone, was, lost, but, it, was, found, in, 1859, it, was, being, used, to, cover, a, well, and, is, now, in, the, palais, des, beaux, arts, museum, in, lille, du, fay, composed, in, most, of, the, common, forms, of, the, day, including, masses, motets, magnificats, hymns, simple, chant, settings, in, fauxbourdon, and, antiphons, within, the, area, of, sacred, music, and, rondeaux, ballades, virelais, and, a, few, other, chanson, types, within, the, realm, of, secular, music, none, of, his, surviving, music, is, specifically, instrumental, although, instruments, were, certainly, used, for, some, of, his, secular, music, seven, complete, masses, 28, individual, mass, movements, 15, settings, of, chant, used, in, mass, propers, three, magnificats, two, benedicamus, domino, settings, 15, antiphon, settings, six, of, them, marian, antiphons, 27, hymns, 22, motets, 13, of, these, isorhythmic, in, the, more, angular, austere, 14th, century, style, which, gave, way, to, more, melodic, sensuous, treble, dominated, part, writing, with, phrases, ending, in, the, under, third, cadence, in, du, fay, s, youth, and, 87, chansons, definitely, by, him, have, survived, of, du, fay, s, masses, his, missa, se, la, face, ay, pale, and, missa, l, homme, arm, are, listed, on, allmusic, as, essential, compositions, editions, of, du, fay, s, music, include, many, of, du, fay, s, compositions, were, simple, settings, of, chant, obviously, designed, for, liturgical, use, probably, as, substitutes, for, the, unadorned, chant, and, can, be, seen, as, chant, harmonizations, often, the, harmonization, used, a, technique, of, parallel, writing, known, as, fauxbourdon, as, in, the, following, example, a, setting, of, the, marian, antiphon, ave, maris, stella, du, fay, may, have, been, the, first, composer, to, use, the, term, fauxbourdon, for, this, simpler, compositional, style, prominent, in, 15th, century, liturgical, music, in, general, and, that, of, the, burgundian, school, in, particular, most, of, du, fay, s, secular, songs, follow, the, formes, fixes, rondeau, ballade, and, virelai, which, dominated, secular, european, music, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, he, also, wrote, a, handful, of, italian, ballate, almost, certainly, while, he, was, in, italy, as, is, the, case, with, his, motets, many, of, the, songs, were, written, for, specific, occasions, and, many, are, datable, thus, supplying, useful, biographical, information, most, of, his, songs, are, for, three, voices, using, a, texture, dominated, by, the, highest, voice, the, other, two, voices, unsupplied, with, text, were, probably, played, by, instruments, occasionally, du, fay, used, four, voices, but, in, a, number, of, these, songs, the, fourth, voice, was, supplied, by, a, later, usually, anonymous, composer, typically, he, used, the, rondeau, form, when, writing, love, songs, his, latest, secular, songs, show, influence, from, busnois, and, ockeghem, and, the, rhythmic, and, melodic, differentiation, between, the, voices, is, less, as, in, the, work, of, other, composers, of, the, mid, 15th, century, he, was, beginning, to, tend, towards, the, smooth, polyphony, which, was, to, become, the, predominant, style, fifty, years, later, a, typical, ballade, is, resvellies, vous, et, faites, chiere, lye, which, was, written, in, 1423, for, the, marriage, of, carlo, malatesta, and, vittoria, di, lorenzo, colonna, the, musical, form, is, aabc, for, each, stanza, with, c, being, the, refrain, two, written, works, on, music, theory, by, du, fay, have, been, documented, but, neither, has, survived, the, first, of, these, is, known, from, the, theorist, gaffurius, who, wrote, in, the, margins, of, both, his, ext, uetus, parvus, musicae, and, tractatus, brevis, cantus, plani, references, to, a, musica, by, du, fay, the, citations, however, are, very, brief, and, reveal, nothing, more, than, information, which, might, be, found, in, any, music, treatise, of, the, period, given, the, supposed, unimportance, of, the, treatise, the, biographer, francesco, rocco, rossi, questions, why, gaffurius, would, even, include, the, citations, and, suggests, that, perhaps, he, was, relying, on, the, elder, composer, s, authority, he, concludes, that, the, chronological, proximity, between, the, two, musicians, leads, us, to, consider, this, testimony, faithful, the, second, derives, from, the, nineteenth, century, musicologist, fran, ois, joseph, f, tis, who, claimed, to, have, seen, a, sixteenth, century, copy, of, a, treatise, ascribed, to, du, fay, entitled, tractatus, de, musica, mensurata, et, de, proportionibus, a, treatise, on, measured, music, and, proportions, it, was, last, documented, as, having, been, sold, to, a, london, book, dealer, in, 1824, the, testimony, from, f, tis, remains, problematic, as, nothing, of, it, is, known, aside, from, its, name, making, it, impossible, reconstruct, if, du, fay, did, indeed, write, these, works, he, would, be, among, a, large, tradition, of, composer, theorists, including, johannes, ciconia, franchinus, gaffurius, and, tinctoris, among, others, it, is, possible, that, these, documents, are, the, same, treatise, and, the, references, to, musica, were, shorthand, for, the, work, seen, by, f, tis, alternatively, rossi, notes, that, f, tis, spoke, specifically, of, a, treatise, influenced, by, du, fay, which, may, not, necessarily, mean, he, was, its, author, rossi, however, contends, that, the, works, are, the, same, while, planchart, and, laurenz, l, tteken, list, them, separately, in, their, catalogues, two, known, depictions, of, du, fay, survive, from, his, lifetime, both, described, by, planchart, as, simplified, likenesses, which, clearly, depict, the, same, person, the, earlier, and, better, known, is, a, miniature, of, him, and, binchois, from, a, manuscript, of, the, poet, martin, le, franc, s, le, champion, des, dames, dated, sometime, before, 1451, the, illustration, depicts, du, fay, on, the, left, beside, a, portative, organ, with, binchois, on, the, right, holding, a, small, harp, it, is, folio, 98, recto, of, the, manuscript, which, is, kept, in, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, inv, 12476, in, comparison, to, the, later, depiction, fallows, characterizes, the, miniature, as, more, general, in, its, iconography, the, image, s, illuminator, is, unknown, though, it, was, likely, barth, lemy, poignare, who, was, the, manuscript, s, scribe, regardless, of, the, illuminator, s, identity, the, artist, probably, knew, du, fay, personally, as, their, work, has, been, identified, in, other, manuscripts, originating, in, cambrai, the, other, is, a, carving, on, du, fay, s, funeral, monument, where, he, is, kneeling, in, the, bottom, left, corner, standing, behind, him, is, saint, waltrude, of, mons, the, eponymous, saint, of, the, church, in, mons, where, he, also, held, a, benefice, to, his, right, three, soldiers, and, an, angel, observe, the, resurrected, christ, the, art, historian, ludovic, nys, has, suggested, it, was, based, on, a, c, 1460, woodcut, from, florence, though, the, art, historian, douglas, brine, has, not, found, this, convincing, before, du, fay, s, time, the, concept, of, a, composer, that, is, a, musician, whose, primary, occupation, is, composition, was, largely, unfamiliar, in, europe, the, emergence, of, musicians, who, focused, on, composition, above, other, musical, endeavors, arose, in, the, 15th, century, and, was, exemplified, by, du, fay, due, to, their, mutual, importance, du, fay, and, binchois, have, been, grouped, together, since, their, lifetimes, the, musicologist, reinhard, strohm, considers, this, misleading, noting, that, that, while, binchois, earned, his, enormous, reputation, in, the, one, genre, in, which, he, excelled, as, a, composer, performer, and, possibly, even, poet, du, fay, s, creativity, unfolded, along, many, more, musical, lines, he, furthers, that, du, fay, s, oeuvre, is, more, diversified, than, that, of, any, composer, since, machaut, du, fay, was, one, of, the, last, composers, to, make, use, of, late, medieval, polyphonic, structural, techniques, such, as, isorhythm, and, one, of, the, first, to, employ, the, more, mellifluous, harmonies, phrasing, and, melodies, characteristic, of, the, early, renaissance, his, compositions, within, the, larger, genres, masses, motets, and, chansons, are, mostly, similar, to, each, other, his, renown, is, largely, due, to, what, was, perceived, as, his, perfect, control, of, the, forms, in, which, he, worked, as, well, as, his, gift, for, memorable, and, singable, melody, during, the, 15th, century, he, was, universally, regarded, as, the, greatest, composer, of, his, time, an, opinion, that, has, largely, survived, to, the, present, day, du, fay, is, the, namesake, of, the, dufay, collective, an, early, music, ensemble, of, historically, informed, performances
