nureyev, was, above, all, a, stickler, for, classical, technique, and, his, mastery, of, it, made, him, a, model, for, an, entire, generation, of, dancers, if, the, standard, of, male, dancing, rose, so, visibly, in, the, west, after, the, 1960s, it, was, largely, because, of, nureyev, s, inspiration, nureyev, s, influence, on, the, world, of, ballet, changed, the, perception, of, male, dancers, in, his, own, productions, of, the, classics, the, male, roles, received, much, more, choreography, another, important, influence, was, his, crossing, the, borders, between, classical, ballet, and, modern, dance, by, performing, both, today, it, is, normal, for, dancers, to, receive, training, in, both, styles, but, nureyev, was, the, originator, and, excelled, in, modern, and, classical, dance, he, went, out, of, his, way, to, work, with, modern, dance, great, martha, graham, and, she, created, a, work, specially, for, him, while, gene, kelly, had, done, much, to, combine, modern, and, classical, styles, in, film, he, came, from, a, more, modern, dance, influenced, popular, dance, environment, while, nureyev, made, great, strides, in, gaining, acceptance, of, modern, dance, in, the, classical, ballet, sphere, nureyev, s, charisma, commitment, and, generosity, were, such, that, he, did, not, just, pass, on, his, knowledge, he, personified, the, school, of, life, for, a, dancer, several, dancers, who, were, principals, with, the, paris, opera, ballet, under, his, direction, went, on, to, become, ballet, directors, themselves, inspired, to, continue, nureyev, s, work, and, ideas, manuel, legris, was, director, of, the, vienna, state, ballet, and, now, directs, la, scala, theatre, ballet, laurent, hilaire, was, ballet, director, of, the, stanislavski, theatre, of, moscow, and, is, now, director, of, bavarian, state, ballet, at, munich, and, charles, jude, was, ballet, director, of, the, grand, th, tre, de, bordeaux, mikhail, baryshnikov, the, other, great, dancer, who, like, nureyev, defected, to, the, west, holds, nureyev, in, high, regard, baryshnikov, said, in, an, interview, that, nureyev, was, an, unusual, man, in, all, respects, instinctive, intelligence, constant, curiosity, and, extraordinary, discipline, that, was, his, goal, of, life, and, of, course, love, in, performing, nureyev, had, a, late, start, to, ballet, and, had, to, perfect, his, technique, to, be, a, success, john, tooley, wrote, that, nureyev, grew, up, very, poor, and, had, to, make, up, for, three, to, five, years, in, ballet, education, at, a, high, level, ballet, school, giving, him, a, decisive, impetus, to, acquire, the, maximum, of, technical, skills, and, to, become, the, best, dancer, working, on, perfection, during, his, whole, career, the, challenge, for, all, dancers, whom, nureyev, worked, with, was, to, follow, suit, and, to, share, his, total, commitment, for, dance, advocates, to, describe, the, nureyev, phenomenon, precisely, are, john, tooley, former, general, director, of, the, london, s, royal, opera, house, pierre, berg, former, president, of, op, ra, bastille, venue, of, the, paris, opera, ballet, in, addition, to, the, palais, garnier, and, manuel, legris, principal, dancer, with, the, paris, opera, ballet, nominated, by, nureyev, in, new, york, nureyev, put, it, like, this, i, approach, dancing, from, a, different, angle, than, those, who, begin, dancing, at, eight, or, nine, those, who, have, studied, from, the, beginning, never, question, anything, nureyev, entered, the, vaganova, ballet, academy, at, the, age, of, just, 17, staying, there, for, only, three, years, compared, to, dancers, who, usually, become, principal, dancers, after, entering, the, vaganova, school, at, nine, and, go, through, the, full, nine, years, of, dance, education, nureyev, was, a, contemporary, of, vladimir, vasiliev, who, was, the, premiere, dancer, at, the, bolshoi, later, nureyev, was, a, predecessor, to, mikhail, baryshnikov, at, the, kirov, ballet, now, the, mariinsky, theater, unlike, vasiliev, and, baryshnikov, nureyev, did, not, build, his, reputation, on, success, in, international, ballet, competitions,
