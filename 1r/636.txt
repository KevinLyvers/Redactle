and, motion, pictures, to, have, educational, merit, he, encouraged, his, children, to, watch, films, young, akira, viewed, his, first, movies, at, the, age, of, six, an, important, formative, influence, was, his, elementary, school, teacher, mr, tachikawa, whose, progressive, educational, practices, ignited, in, his, young, pupil, first, a, love, of, drawing, and, then, an, interest, in, education, in, general, during, this, time, akira, also, studied, calligraphy, and, kendo, swordsmanship, another, major, childhood, influence, was, heigo, kurosawa, 1906, 1933, akira, s, older,

devastation, when, akira, wanted, to, look, away, from, the, corpses, of, humans, and, animals, scattered, everywhere, heigo, forbade, him, to, do, so, encouraging, akira, instead, to, face, his, fears, by, confronting, them, directly, some, commentators, have, suggested, that, this, incident, would, influence, kurosawa, s, later, artistic, career, as, the, director, was, seldom, hesitant, to, confront, unpleasant, truths, in, his, work, heigo, was, academically, gifted, but, soon, after, failing, to, secure, a, place, in, tokyo, s, foremost, high, school, he, began, to, detach, himself, from, the, rest, of, the, family, preferring, to, concentrate, on, his, interest, in, foreign, literature, in, the, late, 1920s, heigo, became, a, benshi, silent, film, narrator, for, tokyo, theaters, showing, foreign, films, and, quickly, made, a, name, for, himself, akira, who, at, this, point, planned, to, become, a, painter, moved, in, with, him, and, the, two, brothers, became, inseparable, with, heigo, s, guidance, akira, devoured, not, only, films, but, also, theater, and, circus, performances, while, exhibiting, his, paintings, and, working, for, the, left, wing, proletarian, artists, league, however, he, was, never, able, to, make, a, living, with, his, art, and, as, he, began, to, perceive, most, of, the, proletarian, movement, as, putting, unfulfilled, political, ideals, directly, onto, the, canvas, he, lost, his, enthusiasm, for, painting, with, the, increasing, production, of, talking, pictures, in, the, early, 1930s, film, narrators, like, heigo, began, to, lose, work, and, akira, moved, back, in, with, his, parents, in, july, 1933, heigo, died, by, suicide, kurosawa, has, commented, on, the, lasting, sense, of, loss, he, felt, at, his, brother, s, death, and, the, chapter, of, something, like, an, autobiography, that, describes, it, written, nearly, half, a, century, after, the, event, is, titled, a, story, i, don, t, want, to, tell, only, four, months, later, kurosawa, s, eldest, brother, also, died, leaving, akira, at, age, 23, the, only, one, of, the, kurosawa, brothers, still, living, together, with, his, three, surviving, sisters, in, 1935, the,

previous, interest, in, film, as, a, profession, kurosawa, submitted, the, required, essay, which, asked, applicants, to, discuss, the, fundamental, deficiencies, of, japanese, films, and, find, ways, to, overcome, them, his, half, mocking, view, was, that, if, the, deficiencies, were, fundamental, there, was, no, way, to, correct, them, kurosawa, s, essay, earned, him, a, call, to, take, the, follow, up, exams, and, director, kajir, yamamoto, who, was, among, the, examiners, took, a, liking, to, kurosawa, and, insisted, that, the, studio, hire, him, the, 25, year, old, kurosawa, joined, p, c, l, in, february, 1936, during, his, five, years, as, an, assistant, director, kurosawa, worked, under, numerous, directors, but, by, far, the, most, important, figure, in, his, development, was, yamamoto, of, his, 24, films, as, a, d, he, worked, on, 17, under, yamamoto, many, of, them, comedies, featuring, the, popular, actor, ken, ichi, enomoto, known, as, enoken, yamamoto, nurtured, kurosawa, s, talent, promoting, him, directly, from, third, assistant, director, to, chief, assistant, director, after, a, year, kurosawa, s, responsibilities, increased, and, he, worked, at, tasks, ranging, from, stage, construction, and, film, development, to, location, scouting, script, polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing, and, second, unit, directing, in, the, last, of, kurosawa, s, films, as, an, assistant, director, for, yamamoto, horse, 1941, kurosawa, took, over, most, of, the, production, as, his, mentor, was, occupied, with, the, shooting, of, another, film, yamamoto, advised, kurosawa, that, a, good, director, needed, to, master, screenwriting, kurosawa, soon, realized, that, the, potential, earnings, from, his, scripts, were, much, higher, than, what, he, was, paid, as, an, assistant, director, he, later, wrote, or, co, wrote, all, his, films, and, frequently, penned, screenplays, for, other, directors, such, as, satsuo, yamamoto, s, film, a, triumph, of, wings, tsubasa, no, gaika, 1942, this, outside, scriptwriting, would, serve, kurosawa, as, a, lucrative, sideline, lasting, well, into, the, 1960s, long, after, he, became, famous, in, the, two, years, following, the, release, of, horse, in, 1941, kurosawa, searched, for, a, story, he, could, use, to, launch, his, directing, career, towards, the, end, of, 1942, about, a, year, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, novelist, tsuneo, tomita, published, his, musashi, miyamoto, inspired, judo, novel, sanshiro, sugata, the, advertisements, for, which, intrigued, kurosawa, he, bought, the, book, on, its, publication, day, devoured, it, in, one, sitting, and, immediately, asked, toho, to, secure, the, film, rights, kurosawa, s, initial, instinct, proved, correct, as, within, a, few, days, three, other, major, japanese, studios, also, offered, to, buy, the, rights, toho, prevailed, and, kurosawa, began, pre, production, on, his, debut, work, as, director, shooting, of, sanshiro, sugata, began, on, location, in, yokohama, in, december, 1942, production, proceeded, smoothly, but, getting, the, completed, film, past, the, censors, was, an, entirely, different, matter, the, censorship, office, considered, the, work, to, be, objectionably, british, american, by, the, standards, of, wartime, japan, and, it, was, only, through, the, intervention, of, director, yasujir, ozu, who, championed, the, film, that, sanshiro, sugata, was, finally, accepted, for, release, on, march, 25, 1943, kurosawa, had, just, turned, 33, the, movie, became, both, a, critical, and, commercial, success, nevertheless, the, censorship, office, would, later, decide, to, cut, out, some, 18, minutes, of, footage, much, of, which, is, now, considered, lost, he, next, turned, to, the, subject, of, wartime, female, factory, workers, in, the, most, beautiful, a, propaganda, film, which, he, shot, in, a, semi, documentary, style, in, early, 1944, to, elicit, realistic, performances, from, his, actresses, the, director, had, them, live, in, a, real, factory, during, the, shoot, eat, the, factory, food, and, call, each, other, by, their, character, names, he, would, use, similar, methods, with, his, performers, throughout, his, career, during, production, the, actress, playing, the, leader, of, the, factory, workers, y, ko, yaguchi, was, chosen, by, her, colleagues, to, present, their, demands, to, the, director, she, and, kurosawa, were, constantly, at, odds, and, it, was, through, these, arguments, that, the, two, paradoxically, became, close, they, married, on, may, 21, 1945, with, yaguchi, two, months, pregnant, she, never, resumed, her, acting, career, and, the, couple, would, remain, together, until, her, death, in, 1985, they, had, two, children, both, surviving, kurosawa, as, of, 2018, a, son, hisao, born, december, 20, 1945, who, served, as, producer, on, some, of, his, father, s, last, projects, and, kazuko, a, daughter, born, april, 29, 1954, who, became, a, costume, designer, shortly, before, his, marriage, kurosawa, was, pressured, by, the, studio, against, his, will, to, direct, a, sequel, to, his, debut, film, the, often, blatantly, propagandistic, sanshiro, sugata, part, ii, which, premiered, in, may, 1945, is, generally, considered, one, of, his, weakest, pictures, kurosawa, decided, to, write, the, script, for, a, film, that, would, be, both, censor, friendly, and, less, expensive, to, produce, the, men, who, tread, on, the, tiger, s, tail, based, on, the, kabuki, play, kanjinch, and, starring, the, comedian, enoken, with, whom, kurosawa, had, often, worked, during, his, assistant, director, days, was, completed, in, september, 1945, by, this, time, japan, had, surrendered, and, the, occupation, of, japan, had, begun, the, new, american, censors, interpreted, the, values, allegedly, promoted, in, the, picture, as, overly, feudal, and, banned, the, work, it, was, not, released, until, 1952, the, year, another, kurosawa, film, ikiru, was, also, released, ironically, while, in, production, the, film, had, already, been, savaged, by, japanese, wartime, censors, as, too, western, and, democratic, they, particularly, disliked, the, comic, porter, played, by, enoken, so, the, movie, most, probably, would, not, have, seen, the, light, of, day, even, if, the, war, had, continued, beyond, its, completion, after, the, war, kurosawa, influenced, by, the, democratic, ideals, of, the, occupation, sought, to, make, films, that, would, establish, a, new, respect, towards, the, individual, and, the, self, the, first, such, film, no, regrets, for, our, youth, 1946, inspired, by, both, the, 1933, takigawa, incident, and, the, hotsumi, ozaki, wartime, spy, case, criticized, japan, s, prewar, regime, for, its, political, oppression, atypically, for, the, director, the, heroic, central, character, is, a, woman, yukie, setsuko, hara, who, born, into, upper, middle, class, privilege, comes, to, question, her, values, in, a, time, of, political, crisis, the, original, script, had, to, be, extensively, rewritten, and, because, of, its, controversial, theme, and, gender, of, its, protagonist, the, completed, work, divided, critics, nevertheless, it, managed, to, win, the, approval, of, audiences, who, turned, variations, on, the, film, s, title, into, a, postwar, catchphrase, his, next, film, one, wonderful, sunday, premiered, in, july, 1947, to, mixed, reviews, it, is, a, relatively, uncomplicated, and, sentimental, love, story, dealing, with, an, impoverished, postwar, couple, trying, to, enjoy, within, the, devastation, of, postwar, tokyo, their, one, weekly, day, off, the, movie, bears, the, influence, of, frank, capra, d, w, griffith, and, f, w, murnau, each, of, whom, was, among, kurosawa, s, favorite, directors, another, film, released, in, 1947, with, kurosawa, s, involvement, was, the, action, adventure, thriller, snow, trail, directed, by, senkichi, taniguchi, from, kurosawa, s, screenplay, it, marked, the, debut, of, the, intense, young, actor, toshiro, mifune, it, was, kurosawa, who, with, his, mentor, yamamoto, had, intervened, to, persuade, toho, to, sign, mifune, during, an, audition, in, which, the, young, man, greatly, impressed, kurosawa, but, managed, to, alienate, most, of, the, other, judges, drunken, angel, is, often, considered, the, director, s, first, major, work, although, the, script, like, all, of, kurosawa, s, occupation, era, works, had, to, go, through, rewrites, due, to, american, censorship, kurosawa, felt, that, this, was, the, first, film, in, which, he, was, able, to, express, himself, freely, a, gritty, story, of, a, doctor, who, tries, to, save, a, gangster, yakuza, with, tuberculosis, it, was, also, the, first, time, that, kurosawa, directed, mifune, who, went, on, to, play, major, roles, in, all, but, one, of, the, director, s, next, 16, films, the, exception, being, ikiru, while, mifune, was, not, cast, as, the, protagonist, in, drunken, angel, his, explosive, performance, as, the, gangster, so, dominates, the, drama, that, he, shifted, the, focus, from, the, title, character, the, alcoholic, doctor, played, by, takashi, shimura, who, had, already, appeared, in, several, kurosawa, movies, however, kurosawa, did, not, want, to, smother, the, young, actor, s, immense, vitality, and, mifune, s, rebellious, character, electrified, audiences, in, much, the, way, that, marlon, brando, s, defiant, stance, would, startle, american, film, audiences, a, few, years, later, the, film, premiered, in, tokyo, in, april, 1948, to, rave, reviews, and, was, chosen, by, the, prestigious, kinema, junpo, critics, poll, as, the, best, film, of, its, year, the, first, of, three, kurosawa, movies, to, be, so, honored, after, the, completion, of, drunken, angel, toho, became, embroiled, in, a, months, long, labor, strike, in, which, the, toho, union, occupied, the, grounds, of, the, studio, when, toho, management, ceased, paying, workers, salaries, kurosawa, formed, a, touring, acting, troupe, to, raise, funds, directing, anton, chekhov, s, the, proposal, and, an, adaptation, of, drunken, angel, starring, mifune, and, shimura, disillusioned, by, the, division, and, violence, between, employees, at, toho, the, underhanded, tactics, of, toho, leadership, and, the, breaking, of, the, occupation, by, police, and, military, standoff, kurosawa, left, toho, later, recalling, i, had, come, to, understand, that, the, studio, i, had, thought, was, my, home, actually, belonged, to, strangers, kurosawa, with, producer, s, jir, motoki, and, fellow, directors, and, friends, kajiro, yamamoto, mikio, naruse, and, senkichi, taniguchi, formed, a, new, independent, production, unit, called, film, art, association, eiga, geijutsu, ky, kai, for, this, organization, s, debut, work, and, first, film, for, daiei, studios, kurosawa, turned, to, a, contemporary, play, by, kazuo, kikuta, and, together, with, taniguchi, adapted, it, for, the, screen, the, quiet, duel, starred, toshiro, mifune, as, an, idealistic, young, doctor, struggling, with, syphilis, a, deliberate, attempt, by, kurosawa, to, break, the, actor, away, from, being, typecast, as, gangsters, released, in, march, 1949, it, was, a, box, office, success, but, is, generally, considered, one, of, the, director, s, lesser, achievements, his, second, film, of, 1949, also, produced, by, film, art, association, and, released, by, shintoho, was, stray, dog, it, is, a, detective, movie, perhaps, the, first, important, japanese, film, in, that, genre, that, explores, the, mood, of, japan, during, its, painful, postwar, recovery, through, the, story, of, a, young, detective, played, by, mifune, and, his, fixation, on, the, recovery, of, his, handgun, which, was, stolen, by, a, penniless, war, veteran, who, proceeds, to, use, it, to, rob, and, murder, adapted, from, an, unpublished, novel, by, kurosawa, in, the, style, of, a, favorite, writer, of, his, georges, simenon, it, was, the, director, s, first, collaboration, with, screenwriter, ryuzo, kikushima, who, would, later, help, to, script, eight, other, kurosawa, films, a, famous, virtually, wordless, sequence, lasting, over, eight, minutes, shows, the, detective, disguised, as, an, impoverished, veteran, wandering, the, streets, in, search, of, the, gun, thief, it, employed, actual, documentary, footage, of, war, ravaged, tokyo, neighborhoods, shot, by, kurosawa, s, friend, ishir, honda, the, future, director, of, godzilla, the, film, is, considered, a, precursor, to, the, contemporary, police, procedural, and, buddy, cop, film, genres, scandal, released, by, shochiku, in, april, 1950, was, inspired, by, the, director, s, personal, experiences, with, and, anger, towards, japanese, yellow, journalism, the, work, is, an, ambitious, mixture, of, courtroom, drama, and, social, problem, film, about, free, speech, and, personal, responsibility, but, even, kurosawa, regarded, the, finished, product, as, dramatically, unfocused, and, unsatisfactory, and, almost, all, critics, agree, however, it, would, be, kurosawa, s, second, film, of, 1950, that, would, ultimately, win, him, and, japanese, cinema, a, whole, new, international, audience, after, finishing, scandal, kurosawa, was, approached, by, daiei, studios, to, make, another, film, for, them, kurosawa, picked, a, script, by, an, aspiring, young, screenwriter, shinobu, hashimoto, who, would, eventually, work, on, nine, of, his, films, their, first, joint, effort, was, based, on, ry, nosuke, akutagawa, s, experimental, short, story, in, a, grove, which, recounts, the, murder, of, a, samurai, and, the, rape, of, his, wife, from, various, different, and, conflicting, points, of, view, kurosawa, saw, potential, in, the, script, and, with, hashimoto, s, help, polished, and, expanded, it, and, then, pitched, it, to, daiei, who, were, happy, to, accept, the, project, due, to, its, low, budget, the, shooting, of, rashomon, began, on, july, 7, 1950, and, after, extensive, location, work, in, the, primeval, forest, of, nara, wrapped, on, august, 17, just, one, week, was, spent, in, hurried, post, production, hampered, by, a, studio, fire, and, the, finished, film, premiered, at, tokyo, s, imperial, theatre, on, august, 25, expanding, nationwide, the, following, day, the, movie, was, met, by, lukewarm, reviews, with, many, critics, puzzled, by, its, unique, theme, and, treatment, but, it, was, nevertheless, a, moderate, financial, success, for, daiei, kurosawa, s, next, film, for, shochiku, was, the, idiot, an, adaptation, of, the, novel, by, the, director, s, favorite, writer, fyodor, dostoevsky, the, story, is, relocated, from, russia, to, hokkaido, but, otherwise, adheres, closely, to, the, original, a, fact, seen, by, many, critics, as, detrimental, to, the, work, a, studio, mandated, edit, shortened, it, from, kurosawa, s, original, cut, of, 265, minutes, to, just, 166, minutes, making, the, resulting, narrative, exceedingly, difficult, to, follow, the, severely, edited, film, version, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, the, director, s, least, successful, works, and, the, original, full, length, version, no, longer, exists, contemporary, reviews, of, the, much, shortened, edited, version, were, very, negative, but, the, film, was, a, moderate, success, at, the, box, office, largely, because, of, the, popularity, of, one, of, its, stars, setsuko, hara, meanwhile, unbeknownst, to, kurosawa, rashomon, had, been, entered, in, the, venice, film, festival, due, to, the, efforts, of, giuliana, stramigioli, a, japan, based, representative, of, an, italian, film, company, who, had, seen, and, admired, the, movie, and, convinced, daiei, to, submit, it, on, september, 10, 1951, rashomon, was, awarded, the, festival, s, highest, prize, the, golden, lion, shocking, not, only, daiei, but, the, international, film, world, which, at, the, time, was, largely, unaware, of, japan, s, decades, old, cinematic, tradition, after, daiei, briefly, exhibited, a, subtitled, print, of, the, film, in, los, angeles, rko, purchased, distribution, rights, to, rashomon, in, the, united, states, the, company, was, taking, a, considerable, gamble, it, had, put, out, only, one, prior, subtitled, film, in, the, american, market, and, the, only, previous, japanese, talkie, commercially, released, in, new, york, had, been, mikio, naruse, s, comedy, wife, be, like, a, rose, in, 1937, a, critical, and, box, office, flop, however, rashomon, s, commercial, run, greatly, helped, by, strong, reviews, from, critics, and, even, the, columnist, ed, sullivan, earned, 35, 000, in, its, first, three, weeks, at, a, single, new, york, theatre, an, almost, unheard, of, sum, at, the, time, this, success, in, turn, led, to, a, vogue, in, america, and, the, west, for, japanese, movies, throughout, the, 1950s, replacing, the, enthusiasm, for, italian, neorealist, cinema, by, the, end, of, 1952, rashomon, was, released, in, japan, the, united, states, and, most, of, europe, among, the, japanese, film, makers, whose, work, as, a, result, began, to, win, festival, prizes, and, commercial, release, in, the, west, were, kenji, mizoguchi, the, life, of, oharu, ugetsu, sansho, the, bailiff, and, somewhat, later, yasujir, ozu, tokyo, story, an, autumn, afternoon, artists, highly, respected, in, japan, but, before, this, period, almost, totally, unknown, in, the, west, kurosawa, s, growing, reputation, among, western, audiences, in, the, 1950s, would, make, western, audiences, more, sympathetic, to, the, reception, of, later, generations, of, japanese, film, makers, ranging, from, kon, ichikawa, masaki, kobayashi, nagisa, oshima, and, shohei, imamura, to, juzo, itami, takeshi, kitano, and, takashi, miike, his, career, boosted, by, his, sudden, international, fame, kurosawa, now, reunited, with, his, original, film, studio, toho, which, would, go, on, to, produce, his, next, 11, films, set, to, work, on, his, next, project, ikiru, based, on,

year, behind, its, original, release, date, and, about, three, times, over, budget, making, it, at, the, time, the, most, expensive, japanese, film, ever, made, however, by, hollywood, standards, it, was, a, quite, modestly, budgeted, production, even, for, that, time, the, film, received, positive, critical, reaction, and, became, a, big, hit, quickly, making, back, the, money, invested, in, it, and, providing, the, studio, with, a, product, that, they, could, and, did, market, internationally, though, with, extensive, edits, over, time, and, with, the, theatrical, and, home, video, releases, of, the, uncut, version, its, reputation, has, steadily, grown, it, is, now, regarded, by, some, commentators, as, the, greatest, japanese, film, ever, made, and, in, 1999, a, poll, of, japanese,

japanese, fishing, boat, to, nuclear, fallout, with, disastrous, results, it, is, in, this, anxious, atmosphere, that, kurosawa, s, next, film, i, live, in, fear, was, conceived, the, story, concerned, an, elderly, factory, owner, toshiro, mifune, so, terrified, of, the, prospect, of, a, nuclear, attack, that, he, becomes, determined, to, move, his, entire, extended, family, both, legal, and, extra, marital, to, what, he, imagines, is, the, safety, of, a, farm, in, brazil, production, went, much, more, smoothly, than, the, director, s, previous, film, but, a, few, days, before,

the, global, nuclear, stalemate, kurosawa, s, next, project, throne, of, blood, an, adaptation, of, william, shakespeare, s, macbeth, set, like, seven, samurai, in, the, sengoku, era, represented, an, ambitious, transposition, of, the, english, work, into, a, japanese, context, kurosawa, instructed, his, leading, actress, isuzu, yamada, to, regard, the, work, as, if, it, were, a, cinematic, version, of, a, japanese, rather, than, a, european, literary, classic, given, kurosawa, s, appreciation, of, traditional, japanese, stage, acting, the, acting, of, the, players, particularly, yamada, draws, heavily, on, the, stylized, techniques, of, the, noh, theater, it, was, filmed, in, 1956, and, released, in, january, 1957, to, a, slightly, less, negative, domestic, response, than, had, been, the, case, with, the, director, s, previous, film, abroad, throne, of, blood, regardless, of, the, liberties, it, takes, with, its, source, material, quickly, earned, a, place, among, the, most, celebrated, shakespeare, adaptations, another, adaptation, of, a, classic, european, theatrical, work, followed, almost, immediately, with, production, of, the, lower, depths, based, on, a, play, by, maxim, gorky, taking, place, in, may, and, june, 1957, in, contrast, to, the, shakespearean, sweep, of, throne, of, blood, the, lower, depths, was, shot, on, only, two, confined, sets, in, order, to, emphasize, the, restricted, nature, of, the, characters, lives, though, faithful, to, the, play, this, adaptation, of, russian, material, to, a, completely, japanese, setting, in, this, case, the, late, edo, period, unlike, his, earlier, the, idiot, was, regarded, as, artistically, successful, the, film, premiered, in, september, 1957, receiving, a, mixed, response, similar, to, that, of, throne, of, blood, however, some, critics, rank, it, among, the, director, s, most, underrated, works, kurosawa, s, three, next, movies, after, seven, samurai, had, not, managed, to, capture, japanese, audiences, in, the, way, that, that, film, had, the, mood, of, the, director, s, work, had, been, growing, increasingly, pessimistic, and, dark, even, as, japan, entered, a, boom, period, of, high, speed, growth, and, rising, standards, of, living, out, of, step, with, the, prevailing, mood, of, the, era, kurosawa, s, films, questioned, the, possibility, of, redemption, through, personal, responsibility, particularly, in, throne, of, blood, and, the, lower, depths, he, recognized, this, and, deliberately, aimed, for, a, more, light, hearted, and, entertaining, film, for, his, next, production, while, switching, to, the, new, widescreen, format, that, had, been, gaining, popularity, in, japan, the, resulting, film, the, hidden, fortress, is, an, action, adventure, comedy, drama, about, a, medieval, princess, her, loyal, general, and, two, peasants, who, all, need, to, travel, through, enemy, lines, in, order, to, reach, their, home, region, released, in, december, 1958, the, hidden, fortress, became, an, enormous, box, office, success, in, japan, and, was, warmly, received, by, critics, both, in, japan, and, abroad, today, the, film, is, considered, one, of, kurosawa, s, most, lightweight, efforts, though, it, remains, popular, not, least, because, it, is, one, of, several, major, influences, on, george, lucas, s, 1977, space, opera, star, wars, starting, with, rashomon, kurosawa, s, productions, had, become, increasingly, large, in, scope, and, so, had, the, director, s, budgets, toho, concerned, about, this, development, suggested, that, he, might, help, finance, his, own, works, therefore, making, the, studio, s, potential, losses, smaller, while, in, turn, allowing, himself, more, artistic, freedom, as, co, producer, kurosawa, agreed, and, the, kurosawa, production, company, was, established, in, april, 1959, with, toho, as, the, majority, shareholder, despite, risking, his, own, money, kurosawa, chose, a, story, that, was, more, directly, critical, of, the, japanese, business, and, political, elites, than, any, previous, work, the, bad, sleep, well, based, on, a, script, by, kurosawa, s, nephew, mike, inoue, is, a, revenge, drama, about, a, young, man, who, is, able, to, infiltrate, the, hierarchy, of, a, corrupt, japanese, company, with, the, intention, of, exposing, the, men, responsible, for, his, father, s, death, its, theme, proved, topical, while, the, film, was, in, production, the, massive, anpo, protests, were, held, against, the, new, u, s, japan, security, treaty, which, was, seen, by, many, japanese, particularly, the, young, as, threatening, the, country, s, democracy, by, giving, too, much, power, to, corporations, and, politicians, the, film, opened, in, september, 1960, to, positive, critical, reaction, and, modest, box, office, success, the, 25, minute, opening, sequence, depicting, a, corporate, wedding, reception, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, kurosawa, s, most, skillfully, executed, set, pieces, but, the, remainder, of, the, film, is, often, perceived, as, disappointing, by, comparison, the, movie, has, also, been, criticized, for, employing, the, conventional, kurosawan, hero, to, combat, a, social, evil, that, cannot, be, resolved, through, the, actions, of, individuals, however, courageous, or, cunning, yojimbo, the, bodyguard, kurosawa, production, s, second, film, centers, on, a, masterless, samurai, sanjuro, who, strolls, into, a, 19th, century, town, ruled, by, two, opposing, violent, factions, and, provokes, them, into, destroying, each, other, the, director, used, this, work, to, play, with, many, genre, conventions, particularly, the, western, while, at, the, same, time, offering, an, unprecedentedly, for, the, japanese, screen, graphic, portrayal, of, violence, some, commentators, have, seen, the, sanjuro, character, in, this, film, as, a, fantasy, figure, who, magically, reverses, the, historical, triumph, of, the, corrupt, merchant, class, over, the, samurai, class, featuring, tatsuya, nakadai, in, his, first, major, role, in, a, kurosawa, movie, and, with, innovative, photography, by, kazuo, miyagawa, who, shot, rashomon, and, takao, saito, the, film, premiered, in, april, 1961, and, was, a, critically, and, commercially, successful, venture, earning, more, than, any, previous, kurosawa, film, the, movie, and, its, blackly, comic, tone, were, also, widely, imitated, abroad, sergio, leone, s, a, fistful, of, dollars, was, a, virtual, unauthorized, scene, by, scene, remake, with, toho, filing, a, lawsuit, on, kurosawa, s, behalf, and, prevailing, following, the, success, of, yojimbo, kurosawa, found, himself, under, pressure, from, toho, to, create, a, sequel, kurosawa, turned, to, a, script, he, had, written, before, yojimbo, reworking, it, to, include, the, hero, of, his, previous, film, sanjuro, was, the, first, of, three, kurosawa, films, to, be, adapted, from, the, work, of, the, writer, sh, gor, yamamoto, the, others, would, be, red, beard, and, dodeskaden, it, is, lighter, in, tone, and, closer, to, a, conventional, period, film, than, yojimbo, though, its, story, of, a, power, struggle, within, a, samurai, clan, is, portrayed, with, strongly, comic, undertones, the, film, opened, on, january, 1, 1962, quickly, surpassing, yojimbo, s, box, office, success, and, garnering, positive, reviews, kurosawa, had, meanwhile, instructed, toho, to, purchase, the, film, rights, to, king, s, ransom, a, novel, about, a, kidnapping, written, by, american, author, and, screenwriter, evan, hunter, under, his, pseudonym, of, ed, mcbain, as, one, of, his, 87th, precinct, series, of, crime, books, the, director, intended, to, create, a, work, condemning, kidnapping, which, he, considered, one, of, the, very, worst, crimes, the, suspense, film, titled, high, and, low, was, shot, during, the, latter, half, of, 1962, and, released, in, march, 1963, it, broke, kurosawa, s, box, office, record, the, third, film, in, a, row, to, do, so, became, the, highest, grossing, japanese, film, of, the, year, and, won, glowing, reviews, however, his, triumph, was, somewhat, tarnished, when, ironically, the, film, was, blamed, for, a, wave, of, kidnappings, which, occurred, in, japan, about, this, time, he, himself, received, kidnapping, threats, directed, at, his, young, daughter, kazuko, high, and, low, is, considered, by, many, commentators, to, be, among, the, director, s, strongest, works, kurosawa, quickly, moved, on, to, his, next, project, red, beard, based, on, a, short, story, collection, by, sh, gor, yamamoto, and, incorporating, elements, from, dostoevsky, s, novel, the, insulted, and, injured, it, is, a, period, film, set, in, a, mid, nineteenth, century, clinic, for, the, poor, in, which, kurosawa, s, humanist, themes, receive, perhaps, their, fullest, statement, a, conceited, and, materialistic, foreign, trained, young, doctor, yasumoto, is, forced, to, become, an, intern, at, the, clinic, under, the, stern, tutelage, of, doctor, niide, known, as, akahige, red, beard, played, by, mifune, although, he, resists, red, beard, initially, yasumoto, comes, to, admire, his, wisdom, and, courage, and, to, perceive, the, patients, at, the, clinic, whom, he, at, first, despised, as, worthy, of, compassion, and, dignity, y, z, kayama, who, plays, yasumoto, was, an, extremely, popular, film, and, music, star, at, the, time, particularly, for, his, young, guy, wakadaish, series, of, musical, comedies, so, signing, him, to, appear, in, the, film, virtually, guaranteed, kurosawa, strong, box, office, the, shoot, the, filmmaker, s, longest, ever, lasted, well, over, a, year, after, five, months, of, pre, production, and, wrapped, in, spring, 1965, leaving, the, director, his, crew, and, his, actors, exhausted, red, beard, premiered, in, april, 1965, becoming, the, year, s, highest, grossing, japanese, production, and, the, third, and, last, kurosawa, film, to, top, the, prestigious, kinema, jumpo, yearly, critics, poll, it, remains, one, of, kurosawa, s, best, known, and, most, loved, works, in, his, native, country, outside, japan, critics, have, been, much, more, divided, most, commentators, concede, its, technical, merits, and, some, praise, it, as, among, kurosawa, s, best, while, others, insist, that, it, lacks, complexity, and, genuine, narrative, power, with, still, others, claiming, that, it, represents, a, retreat, from, the, artist, s, previous, commitment, to, social, and, political, change, the, film, marked, something, of, an, end, of, an, era, for, its, creator, the, director, himself, recognized, this, at, the, time, of, its, release, telling, critic, donald, richie, that, a, cycle, of, some, kind, had, just, come, to, an, end, and, that, his, future, films, and, production, methods, would, be, different, his, prediction, proved, quite, accurate, beginning, in, the, late, 1950s, television, began, increasingly, to, dominate, the, leisure, time, of, the, formerly, large, and, loyal, japanese, cinema, audience, and, as, film, company, revenues, dropped, so, did, their, appetite, for, risk, particularly, the, risk, represented, by, kurosawa, s, costly, production, methods, red, beard, also, marked, the, midway, point, chronologically, in, the, artist, s, career, during, his, previous, twenty, nine, years, in, the, film, industry, which, includes, his, five, years, as, assistant, director, he, had, directed, twenty, three, films, while, during, the, remaining, twenty, eight, years, for, many, complex, reasons, he, would, complete, only, seven, more, also, for, reasons, never, adequately, explained, red, beard, would, be, his, final, film, starring, toshiro,

richie, has, described, the, rapport, between, them, as, a, unique, symbiosis, when, kurosawa, s, exclusive, contract, with, toho, came, to, an, end, in, 1966, the, 56, year, old, director, was, seriously, contemplating, change, observing, the, troubled, state, of, the, domestic, film, industry, and, having, already, received, dozens, of, offers, from, abroad, the, idea, of, working, outside, japan, appealed, to, him, as, never, before, for, his, first, foreign, project, kurosawa, chose, a, story, based, on, a, life, magazine, article, the, embassy, pictures, action, thriller, to, be, filmed, in, english, and, called, simply, runaway, train, would, have, been, his, first, in, color, but, the, language, barrier, proved, a, major, problem, and, the, english, version, of, the, screenplay, was, not, even, finished, by, the, time, filming, was, to, begin, in, autumn, 1966, the, shoot, which, required, snow, was, moved, to, autumn, 1967, then, canceled, in, 1968, almost, two, decades, later, another, foreign, director, working, in, hollywood, andrei, konchalovsky, finally, made, runaway, train, 1985, though, from, a, new, script, loosely, based, on, kurosawa, s, the, director, meanwhile, had, become, involved, in, a, much, more, ambitious, hollywood, project, tora, tora, tora, produced, by, 20th, century, fox, and, kurosawa, production, would, be, a, portrayal, of, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, from, both, the, american, and, the, japanese, points, of, view, with, kurosawa, helming, the, japanese, half, and, an, anglophonic, film, maker, directing, the, american, half, he, spent, several, months, working, on, the, script, with, ryuzo, kikushima, and, hideo, oguni, but, very, soon, the, project, began, to, unravel, the, director, of, the, american, sequences, turned, out, not, to, be, david, lean, as, originally, planned, but, american, richard, fleischer, the, budget, was, also, cut, and, the, screen, time, allocated, for, the, japanese, segment, would, now, be, no, longer, than, 90, minutes, a, major, problem, considering, that, kurosawa, s, script, ran, over, four, hours, after, numerous, revisions, with, the, direct, involvement, of, darryl, zanuck, a, more, or, less, finalized, cut, screenplay, was, agreed, upon, in, may, 1968, shooting, began, in, early, december, but, kurosawa, would, last, only, a, little, over, three, weeks, as, director, he, struggled, to, work, with, an, unfamiliar, crew, and, the, requirements, of, a, hollywood, production, while, his, working, methods, puzzled, his, american, producers, who, ultimately, concluded, that, the, director, must, be, mentally, ill, kurosawa, was, examined, at, kyoto, university, hospital, by, a, neuropsychologist, dr, murakami, whose, diagnosis, was, forwarded, to, darryl, zanuck, and, richard, zanuck, at, fox, studios, indicating, a, diagnosis, of, neurasthenia, stating, that, he, is, suffering, from, disturbance, of, sleep, agitated, with, feelings, of, anxiety, and, in, manic, excitement, caused, by, the, above, mentioned, illness, it, is, necessary, for, him, to, have, rest, and, medical, treatment, for, more, than, two, months, on, christmas, eve, 1968, the, americans, announced, that, kurosawa, had, left, the, production, due, to, fatigue, effectively, firing, him, he, was, ultimately, replaced, for, the, film, s, japanese, sequences, with, two, directors, kinji, fukasaku, and, toshio, masuda, tora, tora, tora, finally, released, to, unenthusiastic, reviews, in, september, 1970, was, as, donald, richie, put, it, an, almost, unmitigated, tragedy, in, kurosawa, s, career, he, had, spent, years, of, his, life, on, a, logistically, nightmarish, project, to, which, he, ultimately, did, not, contribute, a, foot, of, film, shot, by, himself, he, had, his, name, removed, from, the, credits, though, the, script, used, for, the, japanese, half, was, still, his, and, his, co, writers, he, became, estranged, from, his, longtime, collaborator, writer, ryuzo, kikushima, and, never, worked, with, him, again, the, project, had, inadvertently, exposed, corruption, in, his, own, production, company, a, situation, reminiscent, of, his, own, movie, the, bad, sleep, well, his, very, sanity, had, been, called, into, question, worst, of, all, the, japanese, film, industry, and, perhaps, kurosawa, himself, began, to, suspect, that, he, would, never, make, another, film, knowing, that, his, reputation, was, at, stake, following, the, much, publicised, tora, tora, tora, debacle, kurosawa, moved, quickly, to, a, new, project, to, prove, he, was, still, viable, to, his, aid, came, friends, and, famed, directors, keisuke, kinoshita, masaki, kobayashi, and, kon, ichikawa, who, together, with, kurosawa, established, in, july, 1969, a, production, company, called, the, club, of, the, four, knights, yonki, no, kai, although, the, plan, was, for, the, four, directors, to, create, a, film, each, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, real, motivation, for, the, other, three, directors, was, to, make, it, easier, for, kurosawa, to, successfully, complete, a, film, and, therefore, find, his, way, back, into, the, business, the, first, project, proposed, and, worked, on, was, a, period, film, to, be, called, dora, heita, but, when, this, was, deemed, too, expensive, attention, shifted, to, dodesukaden, an, adaptation, of, yet, another, sh, gor, yamamoto, work, again, about, the, poor, and, destitute, the, film, was, shot, quickly, by, kurosawa, s, standards, in, about, nine, weeks, with, kurosawa, determined, to, show, he, was, still, capable, of, working, quickly, and, efficiently, within, a, limited, budget, for, his, first, work, in, color, the, dynamic, editing, and, complex, compositions, of, his, earlier, pictures, were, set, aside, with, the, artist, focusing, on, the, creation, of, a, bold, almost, surreal, palette, of, primary, colors, in, order, to, reveal, the, toxic, environment, in, which, the, characters, live, it, was, released, in, japan, in, october, 1970, but, though, a, minor, critical, success, it, was, greeted, with, audience, indifference, the, picture, lost, money, and, caused, the, club, of, the, four, knights, to, dissolve, initial, reception, abroad, was, somewhat, more, favorable, but, dodesukaden, has, since, been, typically, considered, an, interesting, experiment, not, comparable, to, the, director, s, best, work, after, struggling, through, the, production, of, dodesukaden, kurosawa, turned, to, television, work, the, following, year, for, the, only, time, in, his, career, with, song, of, the, horse, a, documentary, about, thoroughbred, race, horses, it, featured, a, voice, over, narrated, by, a, fictional, man, and, a, child, voiced, by, the, same, actors, as, the, beggar, and, his, son, in, dodesukaden, it, is, the, only, documentary, in, kurosawa, s, filmography, the, small, crew, included, his, frequent, collaborator, masaru, sato, who, composed, the, music, song, of, the, horse, is, also, unique, in, kurosawa, s, oeuvre, in, that, it, includes, an, editor, s, credit, suggesting, that, it, is, the, only, kurosawa, film, that, he, did, not, cut, himself, unable, to, secure, funding, for, further, work, and, allegedly, having, health, problems, kurosawa, apparently, reached, the, breaking, point, on, december, 22, 1971, he, slit, his, wrists, and, throat, multiple, times, the, suicide, attempt, proved, unsuccessful, and, the, director, s, health, recovered, fairly, quickly, with, kurosawa, now, taking, refuge, in, domestic, life, uncertain, if, he, would, ever, direct, another, film, in, early, 1973, the, soviet, studio, mosfilm, approached, the, film, maker, to, ask, if, he, would, be, interested, in, working, with, them, kurosawa, proposed, an, adaptation, of, russian, explorer, vladimir, arsenyev, s, autobiographical, work, dersu, uzala, the, book, about, a, goldi, hunter, who, lives, in, harmony, with, nature, until, destroyed, by, encroaching, civilization, was, one, that, he, had, wanted, to, make, since, the, 1930s, in, december, 1973, the, 63, year, old, kurosawa, set, off, for, the, soviet, union, with, four, of, his, closest, aides, beginning, a, year, and, a, half, stay, in, the, country, shooting, began, in, may, 1974, in, siberia, with, filming, in, exceedingly, harsh, natural, conditions, proving, very, difficult, and, demanding, the, picture, wrapped, in, april, 1975, with, a, thoroughly, exhausted, and, homesick, kurosawa, returning, to,

the, film, was, better, reviewed, abroad, winning, the, golden, prize, at, the, 9th, moscow, international, film, festival, as, well, as, an, academy, award, for, best, foreign, language, film, today, critics, remain, divided, over, the, film, some, see, it, as, an, example, of, kurosawa, s, alleged, artistic, decline, while, others, count, it, among, his, finest, works, although, proposals, for, television, projects, were, submitted, to, him, he, had, no, interest, in, working, outside, the, film, world, nevertheless, the, hard, drinking, director, did, agree, to, appear, in, a, series, of, television, ads, for, suntory, whiskey, which, aired, in, 1976, while, fearing, that, he, might, never, be, able, to, make, another, film, the, director, nevertheless, continued, working, on, various, projects, writing, scripts, and, creating, detailed, illustrations, intending, to, leave, behind, a, visual, record, of, his, plans, in, case, he, would, never, be, able, to, film, his, stories, in, 1977, george, lucas, released, star, wars, a, wildly, successful, science, fiction, film, influenced, by, kurosawa, s, the, hidden, fortress, lucas, like, many, other, new, hollywood, directors, revered, kurosawa, and, considered, him, a, role, model, and, was, shocked, to, discover, that, the, japanese, film, maker, was, unable, to, secure, financing, for, any, new, work, the, two, met, in, san, francisco, in, july, 1978, to, discuss, the, project, kurosawa, considered, most, financially, viable, kagemusha, the, epic, story, of, a, thief, hired, as, the, double, of, a, medieval, japanese, lord, of, a, great, clan, lucas, enthralled, by, the, screenplay, and, kurosawa, s, illustrations, leveraged, his, influence, over, 20th, century, fox, to, coerce, the, studio, that, had, fired, kurosawa, just, ten, years, earlier, to, produce, kagemusha, then, recruited, fellow, fan, francis, ford, coppola, as, co, producer, production, began, the, following, april, with, kurosawa, in, high, spirits, shooting, lasted, from, june, 1979, through, march, 1980, and, was, plagued, with, problems, not, the, least, of, which, was, the, firing, of, the, original, lead, actor, shintaro, katsu, known, for, portraying, the, popular, character, zatoichi, due, to, an, incident, in, which, the, actor, insisted, against, the, director, s, wishes, on, videotaping, his, own, performance, he, was, replaced, by, tatsuya, nakadai, in, his, first, of, two, consecutive, leading, roles, in, a, kurosawa, movie, the, film, was, completed, only, a, few, weeks, behind, schedule, and, opened, in, tokyo, in, april, 1980, it, quickly, became, a, massive, hit, in, japan, the, film, was, also, a, critical, and, box, office, success, abroad, winning, the, coveted, palme, d, or, at, the, 1980, cannes, film, festival, in, may, though, some, critics, then, and, now, have, faulted, the, film, for, its, alleged, coldness, kurosawa, spent, much, of, the, rest, of, the, year, in, europe, and, america, promoting, kagemusha, collecting, awards, and, accolades, and, exhibiting, as, art, the, drawings, he, had, made, to, serve, as, storyboards, for, the, film, the, international, success, of, kagemusha, allowed, kurosawa, to, proceed, with, his, next, project, ran, another, epic, in, a, similar, vein, the, script, partly, based, on, shakespeare, s, king, lear, depicted, a, ruthless, bloodthirsty, daimy, warlord, played, by, tatsuya, nakadai, who, after, foolishly, banishing, his, one, loyal, son, surrenders, his, kingdom, to, his, other, two, sons, who, then, betray, him, thus, plunging, the, entire, kingdom, into, war, as, japanese, studios, still, felt, wary, about, producing, another, film, that, would, rank, among, the, most, expensive, ever, made, in, the, country, international, help, was, again, needed, this, time, it, came, from, french, producer, serge, silberman, who, had, produced, luis, bu, uel, s, final, movies, filming, did, not, begin, until, december, 1983, and, lasted, more, than, a, year, in, january, 1985, production, of, ran, was, halted, as, kurosawa, s, 64, year, old, wife, y, ko, fell, ill, she, died, on, february, 1, kurosawa, returned, to, finish, his, film, and, ran, premiered, at, the, tokyo, film, festival, on, may, 31, with, a, wide, release, the, next, day, the, film, was, a, moderate, financial, success, in, japan, but, a, larger, one, abroad, and, as, he, had, done, with, kagemusha, kurosawa, embarked, on, a, trip, to, europe, and, america, where, he, attended, the, film, s, premieres, in, september, and, october, ran, won, several, awards, in, japan, but, was, not, quite, as, honored, there, as, many, of, the, director, s, best, films, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, had, been, the, film, world, was, surprised, however, when, japan, passed, over, the, selection, of, ran, in, favor, of, another, film, as, its, official, entry, to, compete, for, an, oscar, nomination, in, the, best, foreign, film, category, which, was, ultimately, rejected, for, competition, at, the, 58th, academy, awards, both, the, producer, and, kurosawa, himself, attributed, the, failure, to, even, submit, ran, for, competition, to, a, misunderstanding, because, of, the, academy, s, arcane, rules, no, one, was, sure, whether, ran, qualified, as, a, japanese, film, a, french, film, due, to, its, financing, or, both, so, it, was, not, submitted, at, all, in, response, to, what, at, least, appeared, to, be, a, blatant, snub, by, his, own, countrymen, the, director, sidney, lumet, led, a, successful, campaign, to, have, kurosawa, receive, an, oscar, nomination, for, best, director, that, year, sydney, pollack, ultimately, won, the, award, for, directing, out, of, africa, ran, s, costume, designer, emi, wada, won, the, movie, s, only, oscar, kagemusha, and, ran, particularly, the, latter, are, often, considered, to, be, among, kurosawa, s, finest, works, after, ran, s, release, kurosawa, would, point, to, it, as, his, best, film, a, major, change, of, attitude, for, the, director, who, when, asked, which, of, his, works, was, his, best, had, always, previously, answered, my, next, one, for, his, next, movie, kurosawa, chose, a, subject, very, different, from, any, that, he, had, ever, filmed, before, while, some, of, his, previous, pictures, for, example, drunken, angel, and, kagemusha, had, included, brief, dream, sequences, dreams, was, to, be, entirely, based, upon, the, director, s, own, dreams, significantly, for, the, first, time, in, over, forty, years, kurosawa, for, this, deeply, personal, project, wrote, the, screenplay, alone, although, its, estimated, budget, was, lower, than, the, films, immediately, preceding, it, japanese, studios, were, still, unwilling, to, back, one, of, his, productions, so, kurosawa, turned, to, another, famous, american, fan, steven, spielberg, who, convinced, warner, bros, to, buy, the, international, rights, to, the, completed, film, this, made, it, easier, for, kurosawa, s, son, hisao, as, co, producer, and, soon, to, be, head, of, kurosawa, production, to, negotiate, a, loan, in, japan, that, would, cover, the, film, s, production, costs, shooting, took, more, than, eight, months, to, complete, and, dreams, premiered, at, cannes, in, may, 1990, to, a, polite, but, muted, reception, similar, to, the, reaction, the, picture, would, generate, elsewhere, in, the, world, in, 1990, he, accepted, the, academy, award, for, lifetime, achievement, in, his, acceptance, speech, he, famously, said, i, m, a, little, worried, because, i, don, t, feel, that, i, understand, cinema, yet, at, the, time, bob, thomas, of, the, daily, spectrum, noted, that, kurosawa, was, considered, by, many, critics, as, the, greatest, living, filmmaker, kurosawa, now, turned, to, a, more, conventional, story, with, rhapsody, in, august, the, director, s, first, film, fully, produced, in, japan, since, dodeskaden, over, twenty, years, before, which, explored, the, scars, of, the, nuclear, bombing, which, destroyed, nagasaki, at, the, very, end, of, world, war, ii, it, was, adapted, from, a, kiyoko, murata, novel, but, the, film, s, references, to, the, nagasaki, bombing, came, from, the, director, rather, than, from, the, book, this, was, his, only, movie, to, include, a, role, for, an, american, movie, star, richard, gere, who, plays, a, small, role, as, the, nephew, of, the, elderly, heroine, shooting, took, place, in, early, 1991, with, the, film, opening, on, may, 25, that, year, to, a, largely, negative, critical, reaction, especially, in, the, united, states, where, the, director, was, accused, of, promulgating, na, vely, anti, american, sentiments, though, kurosawa, rejected, these, accusations, kurosawa, wasted, no, time, moving, onto, his, next, project, madadayo, or, not, yet, based, on, autobiographical, essays, by, hyakken, uchida, the, film, follows, the, life, of, a, japanese, professor, of, german, through, the, second, world, war, and, beyond, the, narrative, centers, on, yearly, birthday, celebrations, with, his, former, students, during, which, the, protagonist, declares, his, unwillingness, to, die, just, yet, a, theme, that, was, becoming, increasingly, relevant, for, the, film, s, 81, year, old, creator, filming, began, in, february, 1992, and, wrapped, by, the, end, of, september, its, release, on, april, 17, 1993, was, greeted, by, an, even, more, disappointed, reaction, than, had, been, the, case, with, his, two, preceding, works, kurosawa, nevertheless, continued, to, work, he, wrote, the, original, screenplays, the, sea, is, watching, in, 1993, and, after, the, rain, in, 1995, while, putting, finishing, touches, on, the, latter, work, in, 1995, kurosawa, slipped, and, broke, the, base, of, his, spine, following, the, accident, he, would, use, a, wheelchair, for, the, rest, of, his, life, putting, an, end, to, any, hopes, of, him, directing, another, film, his, longtime, wish, to, die, on, the, set, while, shooting, a, movie, was, never, to, be, fulfilled, after, his, accident, kurosawa, s, health, began, to, deteriorate, while, his, mind, remained, sharp, and, lively, his, body, was, giving, up, and, for, the, last, half, year, of, his, life, the, director, was, largely, confined, to, bed, listening, to, music, and, watching, television, at, home, on,

equilibrium, and, flow, are, perfect, and, he, uses, space, in, such, a, well, balanced, way, it, is, one, of, the, best, films, ever, made, according, to, an, assistant, stanley, kubrick, considered, kurosawa, to, be, one, of, the, great, film, directors, and, spoke, of, him, consistently, and, admiringly, to, the, point, that, a, letter, from, him, meant, more, than, any, oscar, and, caused, him, to, agonize, for, months, over, drafting, a, reply, robert, altman, upon, first, seeing, rashomon, was, so, impressed, by, the, sequence, of, frames, of, the, sun, that, he, began, to, shoot, the,

it, didn, t, matter, that, i, did, not, understand, the, culture, or, the, traditions, from, that, moment, on, kurosawa, s, films, have, served, as, one, of, my, strongest, sources, of, creative,

the, french, new, wave, began, to, favor, mizoguchi, over, kurosawa, new, wave, critic, and, film, maker, jacques, rivette, in, particular, thought, mizoguchi, to, be, the, only, japanese, director, whose, work, was, at, once, entirely, japanese, and, truly, universal, kurosawa, by, contrast, was, thought, to, be, more, influenced, by, western, cinema, and, culture, a, view, that, has, been,

validity, to, them, constitutes, evidence, for, this, point, of, view, these, japanese, critics, argued, that, kurosawa, was, not, sufficiently, progressive, because, the, peasants, were, unable, to, find, leaders, from, within, their, ranks, in, an, interview, with, mellen, kurosawa, defended, himself, saying, i, wanted, to, say, that, after, everything, the, peasants, were, the, stronger, closely, clinging, to, the, earth, it, was, the, samurai, who, were, weak, because, they, were, being, blown, by, the, winds, of, time, from, the, early, 1950s, kurosawa, was, also, charged, with,
