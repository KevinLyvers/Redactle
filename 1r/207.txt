tang, a, great, admirer, of, wang, amassed, a, collection, of, over, 2, 000, of, his, works, including, originals, and, copies, and, required, that, the, imperial, court, scholars, study, his, calligraphic, techniques, the, emperor, was, particularly, fascinated, with, the, lantingji, xu, and, went, to, great, lengths, to, obtain, the, original, which, he, ordered, to, be, buried, in, his, mausoleum, upon, his, death, he, employed, calligraphers, to, make, tracing, copies, of, the, lantingji, xu, and, other, works, by, wang, using, semitransparent, tracing, paper, that, was, placed, over, the, original, versions, they, also, produced, copies, using, the, ink, rubbing, technique, which, involved, carving, a, tracing, copy, into, a, stone, block, placing, a, thin, sheet, of, paper, over, the, engraving, and, pounding, an, inkpad, onto, the, surface, to, transfer, the, characters, to, the, paper, this, process, was, more, efficient, than, tracing, by, hand, but, it, was, also, less, accurate, these, reproductions, along, with, the, creation, of, an, imperial, office, to, teach, calligraphy, to, young, scholars, in, the, capital, firmly, established, wang, and, his, style, as, the, defining, standard, for, chinese, calligraphy, according, to, the, art, historian, lothar, ledderose, emperor, taizong, was, the, one, man, who, did, most, for, the, propagation, of, the, wang, tradition, the, emperors, of, the, song, dynasty, continued, to, promote, reproductions, of, wang, s, calligraphy, around, this, time, the, dingwu, stone, an, engraving, of, the, lantingji, xu, made, by, ouyang, xun, and, widely, considered, to, be, most, faithful, to, the, original, was, discovered, in, the, hebei, province, during, the, ming, dynasty, wang, s, works, were, mainly, promoted, by, private, collectors, who, accumulated, compilation, albums, of, his, rubbings, in, the, present, day, there, are, no, known, surviving, original, works, by, wang, xizhi, the, earliest, extant, reproductions, of, his, work, were, produced, during, the, tang, dynasty, including, a, small, number, of, tracing, copies, numerous, rubbings, exist, including, many, copies, of, the, dingwu, stone, but, these, have, likely, become, less, accurate, over, the, centuries, as, inaccuracies, are, propagated, over, time, when, new, engravings, are, made, from, older, rubbings, dragons, leaping, at, the, gate, of, heaven, tigers, crouching, at, the, phoenix, tower, wang, is, known, for, his, proficiency, in, multiple, chinese, script, styles, particularly, the, regular, kaishu, semi, cursive, xingshu, and, cursive, caoshu, forms, his, calligraphy, also, contains, traces, of, patterns, found, in, the, early, seal, script, zhuanshu, style, according, to, an, analysis, by, dong, qichang, an, art, theorist, and, calligrapher, of, the, ming, dynasty, who, studied, the, stylistic, effects, of, the, brush, tip, in, wang, s, works, although, he, produced, famous, works, in, multiple, script, styles, he, remains, best, known, for, his, innovations, in, semi, cursive, script, the, style, of, the, lantingji, xu, his, works, vary, in, length, from, a, few, lines, to, several, hundred, characters, and, apart, from, the, lantingji, xu, and, his, letters, to, others, are, largely, copies, of, existing, texts, a, hallmark, of, wang, s, calligraphy, according, to, the, art, historian, robert, e, harrist, jr, is, the, presence, of, brushstrokes, that, are, carefully, formed, and, create, a, sense, of, disciplined, energy, flowing, down, the, page, even, for, text, that, appears, to, have, been, rapidly, written, he, regularly, experimented, with, varying, the, speed, and, direction, of, the, brush, resulting, in, distinctive, visual, characteristics, in, different, instances, of, recurring, strokes, in, the, lantingji, xu, for, instance, characters, that, are, repeated, have, different, visual, forms, creating, a, sense, of, spontaneity, that, reflects, the, scene, during, which, it, was, written, in, contrast, to, the, relatively, wide, characters, typically, seen, in, clerical, script, lishu, wang, s, characters, were, more, vertically, elongated, and, compact, the, study, of, wang, s, style, is, challenged, by, the, lack, of, surviving, original, works, in, debating, the, differences, between, wang, s, calligraphy, and, archaeological, texts, produced, by, other, writers, around, the, same, time, period, some, scholars, have, questioned, the, relative, influence, of, wang, versus, the, tang, calligraphers, who, copied, his, pieces, ledderose, observes, that, the, works, attributed, to, wang, vary, widely, in, style, precision, and, balance, making, a, correct, assessment, of, his, personal, contribution, quite, difficult, written, in, regular, script, written, in, semi, cursive, script, written, in, cursive, script, the, complicated, textual, history, of, wang, s, calligraphy, has, led, to, debates, over, the, authenticity, of, his, works, primarily, the, lantingji, xu, during, the, song, dynasty, the, poets, jiang, kui, and, lu, you, began, to, question, the, authenticity, of, the, preface, several, centuries, later, some, scholars, of, the, qing, dynasty, rejected, the, claim, that, wang, produced, the, lantingji, xu, based, on, arguments, that, that, it, did, not, include, characters, written, in, clerical, script, that, its, semi, cursive, script, may, not, have, been, developed, until, after, wang, s, lifetime, and, that, it, was, inconsistent, with, another, recorded, version, the, linhe, xu, preface, to, the, riverbank, gathering, they, instead, hypothesized, that, it, was, written, by, a, later, calligrapher, of, the, sui, or, tang, dynasties, but, this, was, a, minority, view, at, the, time, during, the, 1960s, the, question, of, the, lantingji, xu, s, authenticity, was, revived, by, guo, moruo, the, chairman, of, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, and, the, china, federation, of, literary, and, art, circles, guo, published, an, article, in, 1965, rejecting, wang, s, authorship, based, on, the, recent, discovery, of, tombs, from, the, jin, dynasty, whose, inscriptions, were, written, in, clerical, script, guo, also, presented, the, argument, that, portions, of, the, lantingji, xu, which, somberly, reflect, on, the, transience, of, life, were, inconsistent, with, the, celebratory, nature, of, the, orchid, pavilion, gathering, he, suggested, that, it, was, actually, written, by, zhiyong, a, buddhist, monk, who, was, a, descendant, of, wang, in, the, wake, of, the, socialist, education, movement, few, scholars, were, willing, to, publicly, challenge, guo, s, claims, and, those, who, did, were, attacked, by, guo, and, his, political, allies, in, the, chinese, communist, party, he, jianjun, a, scholar, of, chinese, history, wrote, that, guo, s, motivation, for, challenging, the, authenticity, of, the, lantingji, xu, was, political, not, academic, and, that, guo, was, deliberately, trying, to, subvert, the, single, most, important, chinese, work, of, art, of, past, millennia, usher, in, the, cultural, revolution, and, establish, his, own, authority, in, cultural, debates, these, debates, over, wang, s, calligraphy, subsided, after, 1966, as, critics, shifted, their, focus, to, other, works, such, as, hai, rui, dismissed, from, office, guo, s, claim, that, clerical, script, would, have, been, used, exclusively, during, wang, s, lifetime, was, weakened, in, 1988, upon, the, discovery, of, an, eastern, jin, tomb, with, an, inscription, written, in, regular, script, wang, s, works, were, already, popular, during, his, lifetime, and, in, the, centuries, after, wang, s, death, collectors, continued, to, seek, out, his, calligraphy, the, value, of, an, imperial, collection, was, often, judged, by, the, number, of, works, written, by, the, two, wangs, as, wang, xizhi, s, works, were, the, most, valuable, part, of, the, collection, they, surpassed, their, aesthetic, value, and, function, as, a, symbol, of, power, thus, emperors, continually, sought, to, expand, their, collection, of, wang, s, calligraphy, in, order, to, strengthen, their, own, perceived, legitimacy, around, the, time, of, the, tang, dynasty, he, was, designated, the, sage, of, calligraphy, shu, sheng, a, title, that, is, still, used, to, describe, him, in, the, present, day, as, a, result, of, emperor, taizong, s, patronage, wang, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, most, significant, chinese, calligrapher, in, history, the, lantingji, xu, according, to, ledderose, is, the, most, celebrated, piece, of, calligraphy, of, all, time, admired, for, both, its, calligraphy, and, its, text, he, is, an, influential, figure, in, japanese, calligraphy, as, well, after, his, calligraphy, was, established, as, the, defining, model, in, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, it, was, transmitted, to, japan, during, the, nara, and, heian, periods, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, heian, court, standardized, wang, s, semi, cursive, and, cursive, scripts, and, these, were, copied, by, japanese, calligraphers, resulting, in, a, distinctive, japanese, style, of, that, time, period, extant, tracing, copies, of, wang, s, work, which, are, rare, continue, to, be, highly, valued, in, 2010, a, scroll, with, four, lines, of, wang, s, calligraphy, copied, during, the, tang, dynasty, was, sold, at, an, china, guardian, auction, in, beijing, for, cn, 308, million, us, 46, million, several, locations, associated, with, wang, s, life, have, become, visitor, attractions, in, china, the, site, of, his, childhood, residence, in, linyi, is, open, to, tourists, and, features, an, ink, pond, where, he, reportedly, washed, his, brush, while, writing, in, shaoxing, the, site, of, the, orchid, pavilion, contains, a, stone, engraving, of, the, lantingji, xu, and, receives, over, one, million, visitors, annually, and, his, tomb, is, popular, with,
