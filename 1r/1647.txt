lise, meitner, l, i, z, m, a, t, n, r, lee, z, myte, n, r, german, born, elise, meitner, 7, november, 1878, 27, october, 1968, was, an, austrian, physicist, who, was, instrumental, in, the, discovery, of, protactinium, and, nuclear, fission, completing, her, doctoral, research, in, 1905, meitner, became, the, second, woman, from, the, university, of, vienna, to, earn, a, doctorate, in, physics, she, spent, much, of, her, scientific, career, in, berlin, where, she, was, a, physics, professor, and, a, department, head, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, there, she, was, the, first, woman, to, become, a, full, professor, of, physics, in, germany, she, lost, her, positions, in, 1935, because, of, the, anti, jewish, nuremberg, laws, of, nazi, germany, and, the, 1938, anschluss, resulted, in, the, loss, of, her, austrian, citizenship, on, 13, 14, july, 1938, she, fled, to, the, netherlands, with, the, help, of, dirk, coster, she, lived, in, stockholm, for, many, years, ultimately, becoming, a, swedish, citizen, in, 1949, but, relocated, to, britain, in, the, 1950s, to, be, with, family, members, in, mid, 1938, meitner, and, chemists, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, demonstrated, that, isotopes, of, barium, could, be, formed, by, neutron, bombardment, of, uranium, meitner, was, informed, of, their, findings, by, hahn, and, in, late, december, with, her, nephew, fellow, physicist, otto, robert, frisch, she, worked, out, the, physics, of, this, process, by, correctly, interpreting, hahn, and, strassmann, s, experimental, data, on, 13, january, 1939, frisch, replicated, the, process, hahn, and, strassmann, had, observed, in, meitner, and, frisch, s, report, in, the, february, 1939, issue, of, nature, they, gave, the, process, the, name, fission, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, led, to, the, development, of, atomic, bombs, and, nuclear, reactors, during, world, war, ii, meitner, did, not, share, the, 1944, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, nuclear, fission, which, was, awarded, to, her, long, time, collaborator, otto, hahn, several, scientists, and, journalists, have, called, her, exclusion, unjust, according, to, the, nobel, prize, archive, she, was, nominated, 19, times, for, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, between, 1924, and, 1948, and, 30, times, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, between, 1937, and, 1967, despite, not, having, been, awarded, the, nobel, prize, meitner, was, invited, to, attend, the, lindau, nobel, laureate, meeting, in, 1962, she, received, many, other, honours, including, the, posthumous, naming, of, element, 109, meitnerium, in, 1997, meitner, was, praised, by, albert, einstein, as, the, german, marie, curie, elise, meitner, was, born, on, 7, november, 1878, into, a, jewish, upper, middle, class, family, at, the, family, home, in, 27, kaiser, josefstra, e, in, the, leopoldstadt, district, of, vienna, the, third, of, eight, children, of, chess, master, philipp, meitner, and, his, wife, hedwig, the, birth, register, of, vienna, s, jewish, community, lists, her, as, being, born, on, 17, november, 1878, but, all, other, documents, list, her, date, of, birth, as, 7, november, which, is, what, she, used, her, father, was, one, of, the, first, jewish, lawyers, admitted, to, practice, in, austria, she, had, two, older, siblings, gisela, and, auguste, gusti, and, four, younger, moriz, fritz, carola, lola, frida, and, walter, all, ultimately, pursued, an, advanced, education, her, father, was, a, freethinker, and, she, was, brought, up, as, such, as, an, adult, she, converted, to, christianity, following, lutheranism, and, was, baptised, in, 1908, her, sisters, gisela, and, lola, converted, to, catholicism, that, same, year, she, also, adopted, the, shortened, name, lise, meitner, s, interest, in, science, began, when, she, was, eight, when, she, kept, a, notebook, of, her, scientific, research, under, her, pillow, she, was, drawn, to, mathematics, and, science, and, studied, the, colours, of, an, oil, slick, thin, films, and, reflected, light, the, only, career, available, to, women, was, teaching, so, she, attended, a, high, school, for, girls, where, she, trained, as, a, french, teacher, as, well, as, french, her, education, included, bookkeeping, arithmetic, history, geography, science, and, gymnastics, she, completed, high, school, in, 1892, women, were, not, allowed, to, attend, public, institutions, of, higher, education, in, vienna, until, 1897, but, when, this, restriction, was, lifted, the, requirement, for, a, gymnasium, education, was, waived, and, women, only, needed, to, pass, the, matura, the, secondary, school, leaving, qualification, required, for, university, entrance, her, sister, gisela, passed, the, matura, and, entered, medical, school, in, 1900, meitner, began, taking, private, lessons, with, two, other, young, women, in, 1899, cramming, the, missing, years, of, secondary, education, into, two, physics, was, taught, by, arthur, szarvasy, in, july, 1901, they, sat, an, external, matura, examination, at, the, akademisches, gymnasium, four, out, of, the, fourteen, women, passed, including, meitner, and, henriette, boltzmann, the, daughter, of, physicist, ludwig, boltzmann, meitner, entered, the, university, of, vienna, in, october, 1901, she, was, particularly, inspired, by, ludwig, boltzmann, and, often, spoke, with, enthusiasm, about, his, lectures, her, dissertation, was, supervised, by, franz, exner, and, his, assistant, hans, benndorf, her, thesis, titled, pr, fung, einer, formel, maxwells, examination, of, a, maxwell, equation, was, submitted, on, 20, november, 1905, and, approved, on, 28, november, she, passed, an, oral, exam, from, exner, and, boltzmann, on, 19, december, and, was, awarded, her, doctorate, on, 1, february, 1906, she, became, the, second, woman, to, earn, a, doctoral, degree, in, physics, at, the, university, of, vienna, after, olga, steindler, who, had, received, her, degree, in, 1903, the, third, was, selma, freud, who, worked, in, the, same, laboratory, as, meitner, and, received, hers, in, 1906, meitner, s, thesis, was, published, as, w, rmeleitung, in, inhomogenen, k, rpern, thermal, conduction, in, inhomogeneous, bodies, on, 22, february, 1906, paul, ehrenfest, asked, her, to, investigate, an, article, on, optics, by, lord, rayleigh, detailing, an, experiment, that, produced, results, rayleigh, had, been, unable, to, explain, she, was, able, to, explain, the, results, and, also, made, predictions, based, on, her, explanation, which, she, then, verified, experimentally, demonstrating, her, ability, to, carry, out, independent, and, unsupervised, research, she, published, the, results, in, her, report, on, some, conclusions, derived, from, the, fresnel, reflection, formula, in, 1906, while, engaged, in, this, research, meitner, was, introduced, by, stefan, meyer, to, radioactivity, then, a, very, new, field, of, study, she, started, with, alpha, particles, in, her, experiments, with, collimators, and, metal, foil, she, found, that, scattering, in, a, beam, of, alpha, particles, increased, with, the, mass, of, the, metal, atoms, she, submitted, her, findings, to, the, physikalische, zeitschrift, on, 29, june, 1907, this, was, one, of, the, experiments, that, led, ernest, rutherford, to, predict, the, nuclear, atom, encouraged, and, backed, by, her, father, s, financial, support, meitner, entered, the, friedrich, wilhelm, university, in, berlin, where, the, renowned, physicist, max, planck, taught, planck, invited, her, to, his, home, and, allowed, her, to, attend, his, lectures, this, was, an, unusual, gesture, by, planck, who, was, on, record, as, opposing, the, admission, of, women, to, universities, in, general, but, apparently, recognised, meitner, as, an, exception, she, became, friends, with, planck, s, twin, daughters, emma, and, grete, who, were, born, in, 1889, and, shared, meitner, s, love, of, music, attending, planck, s, lectures, did, not, take, up, all, her, time, and, meitner, approached, heinrich, rubens, the, head, of, the, experimental, physics, institute, about, doing, some, research, rubens, said, that, he, would, be, happy, for, her, to, work, in, his, laboratory, he, also, added, that, otto, hahn, at, the, chemistry, institute, was, looking, for, a, physicist, to, collaborate, with, a, few, minutes, later, she, was, introduced, to, hahn, he, had, studied, radioactive, substances, under, william, ramsay, and, ernest, rutherford, and, was, already, credited, with, the, discovery, of, what, were, then, thought, to, be, several, new, radioactive, elements, hahn, was, the, same, age, as, meitner, and, she, noted, his, informal, and, approachable, manner, in, montreal, hahn, had, become, accustomed, to, collaboration, with, physicists, including, at, least, one, woman, harriet, brooks, the, head, of, the, chemistry, institute, emil, fischer, placed, a, former, woodworking, shop, holzwerkstatt, at, hahn, s, disposal, in, the, basement, to, use, as, a, laboratory, hahn, equipped, it, with, electroscopes, to, measure, alpha, and, beta, particles, and, gamma, rays, it, was, not, possible, to, conduct, research, in, the, wood, shop, but, alfred, stock, the, head, of, the, inorganic, chemistry, department, let, hahn, use, a, space, in, one, of, his, two, private, laboratories, like, meitner, hahn, was, unpaid, and, lived, off, an, allowance, from, his, father, although, somewhat, larger, than, hers, he, completed, his, habilitation, in, early, 1907, and, became, a, privatdozent, most, of, the, organic, chemists, at, the, chemistry, institute, did, not, regard, hahn, s, work, detecting, minute, traces, of, isotopes, too, small, to, see, weigh, or, smell, through, their, radioactivity, as, real, chemistry, one, department, head, remarked, that, it, is, incredible, what, one, gets, to, be, a, privatdozent, these, days, the, arrangement, was, difficult, for, meitner, at, first, women, were, not, yet, admitted, to, universities, in, the, german, state, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, which, included, berlin, meitner, was, allowed, to, work, in, the, wood, shop, which, had, its, own, external, entrance, but, she, could, not, enter, the, rest, of, the, institute, including, hahn, s, laboratory, space, upstairs, if, she, wanted, to, go, to, the, toilet, she, had, to, use, one, at, the, restaurant, down, the, street, the, following, year, women, were, admitted, to, prussian, universities, and, fischer, lifted, the, restrictions, and, had, women, s, toilets, installed, in, the, building, not, all, the, chemists, were, happy, about, this, the, institute, of, physics, was, more, accepting, and, she, became, friends, with, the, physicists, there, including, otto, von, baeyer, james, franck, gustav, hertz, robert, pohl, max, planck, peter, pringsheim, and, wilhelm, westphal, during, the, first, years, meitner, worked, with, hahn, they, co, authored, nine, papers, three, in, 1908, and, six, in, 1909, together, with, hahn, she, discovered, and, developed, a, physical, separation, method, known, as, radioactive, recoil, in, which, a, daughter, nucleus, is, forcefully, ejected, as, it, recoils, at, the, moment, of, decay, while, hahn, was, more, concerned, with, discovering, new, elements, now, known, to, be, isotopes, meitner, was, more, interested, in, understanding, their, radiation, she, observed, that, radioactive, recoil, which, had, been, discovered, by, harriet, brooks, in, 1904, could, be, a, new, way, of, detecting, radioactive, substances, they, soon, discovered, two, more, new, isotopes, bismuth, 211, and, thallium, 207, meitner, was, particularly, interested, in, beta, particles, by, this, time, they, were, known, to, be, electrons, alpha, particles, were, emitted, with, characteristic, energy, and, she, expected, that, this, would, be, true, of, beta, particles, too, hahn, and, meitner, carefully, measured, the, absorption, of, beta, particles, by, aluminium, but, the, results, were, puzzling, in, 1914, james, chadwick, found, that, electrons, emitted, from, the, nucleus, formed, a, continuous, spectrum, but, meitner, found, this, hard, to, believe, as, it, seemed, to, contradict, quantum, physics, which, held, that, electrons, in, an, atom, can, only, occupy, discrete, energy, states, quanta, in, 1912, hahn, and, meitner, moved, to, the, newly, founded, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, kwi, for, chemistry, in, berlin, hahn, accepted, an, offer, from, fischer, to, become, a, junior, assistant, in, charge, of, its, radiochemistry, section, the, first, laboratory, of, its, kind, in, germany, the, job, came, with, the, title, of, professor, and, a, salary, of, 5, 000, marks, per, annum, equivalent, to, 29, 000, in, 2021, unlike, the, universities, the, privately, funded, kwi, had, no, policies, excluduing, women, but, meitner, worked, without, pay, as, a, guest, in, hahn, s, section, she, may, have, encountered, financial, difficulties, after, the, death, of, her, father, in, 1910, fearing, she, might, return, to, vienna, planck, appointed, her, as, his, assistant, at, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, in, the, friedrich, wilhelm, university, as, such, she, marked, his, students, papers, it, was, her, first, paid, position, assistant, was, the, lowest, rung, on, the, academic, ladder, and, meitner, was, the, first, female, scientific, assistant, in, prussia, proud, officials, presented, meitner, to, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, at, the, official, opening, of, the, kwi, for, chemistry, on, 23, october, 1912, the, following, year, she, became, a, mitglied, associate, like, hahn, although, her, salary, was, still, less, and, the, radioactivity, section, became, the, hahn, meitner, laboratory, meitner, celebrated, with, a, dinner, party, at, the, hotel, adlon, hahn, and, meitner, s, salaries, would, soon, be, dwarfed, by, royalties, from, mesothorium, middle, thorium, radium, 228, also, called, german, radium, produced, for, medical, purposes, for, which, hahn, received, 66, 000, marks, in, 1914, equivalent, to, 369, 000, in, 2021, he, gave, ten, per, cent, to, meitner, in, 1914, meitner, was, offered, an, academic, position, in, prague, which, was, then, part, of, her, country, of, austria, hungary, planck, made, it, clear, to, fischer, that, he, did, not, want, meitner, to, leave, and, fischer, arranged, for, her, salary, to, be, doubled, to, 3, 000, marks, equivalent, to, 17, 000, in, 2021, the, move, to, new, accommodation, was, fortunate, as, the, wood, shop, had, become, thoroughly, contaminated, by, radioactive, liquids, that, had, been, spilt, and, radioactive, gases, that, had, vented, and, decayed, then, settled, as, radioactive, dust, making, sensitive, measurements, impossible, to, ensure, that, their, clean, new, laboratories, stayed, that, way, hahn, and, meitner, instituted, strict, procedures, chemical, and, physical, measurements, were, conducted, in, different, rooms, people, handling, radioactive, substances, had, to, follow, protocols, that, included, not, shaking, hands, and, rolls, of, toilet, paper, were, hung, next, to, every, telephone, and, door, handle, strongly, radioactive, substances, were, stored, in, the, old, wood, shop, and, later, in, a, purpose, built, radium, house, on, the, institute, grounds, in, july, 1914, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, hahn, was, called, to, active, duty, with, the, army, in, a, landwehr, regiment, meitner, undertook, x, ray, technician, training, and, a, course, on, anatomy, at, the, city, hospital, in, lichterfelde, meanwhile, she, completed, both, the, work, on, the, beta, ray, spectrum, that, she, had, begun, before, the, war, with, hahn, and, baeyer, and, her, own, study, of, the, uranium, decay, chain, in, july, 1915, she, returned, to, vienna, where, she, joined, the, austrian, army, as, an, x, ray, nurse, technician, her, unit, was, deployed, to, the, eastern, front, in, poland, and, she, also, served, on, the, italian, front, before, being, discharged, in, september, 1916, meitner, returned, to, the, kwi, for, chemistry, and, her, research, in, october, in, january, 1917, she, was, appointed, as, head, of, her, own, physics, section, the, hahn, meitner, laboratory, was, divided, into, separate, hahn, and, meitner, laboratories, and, her, pay, was, increased, to, 4, 000, marks, equivalent, to, 10, 000, in, 2021, hahn, returned, to, berlin, on, leave, and, they, discussed, another, loose, end, from, their, pre, war, work, the, search, for, the, mother, isotope, of, actinium, element, 89, according, to, the, radioactive, displacement, law, of, fajans, and, soddy, this, had, to, be, an, isotope, of, the, undiscovered, element, 91, on, the, periodic, table, that, lay, between, thorium, element, 90, and, uranium, element, 92, kasimir, fajans, and, oswald, helmuth, g, hring, discovered, the, missing, element, in, 1913, and, named, it, brevium, after, its, short, half, life, however, the, isotope, they, had, found, was, a, beta, emitter, and, therefore, could, not, be, the, mother, isotope, of, actinium, this, had, to, be, another, isotope, of, the, same, element, in, 1914, hahn, and, meitner, had, developed, a, new, technique, for, separating, the, tantalum, group, from, pitchblende, which, they, hoped, would, speed, the, isolation, of, the, new, isotope, when, meitner, resumed, this, work, in, 1917, hahn, and, most, of, the, students, laboratory, assistants, and, technicians, had, been, called, up, to, serve, in, the, armed, forces, so, meitner, had, to, do, everything, herself, in, february, she, extracted, 2, grams, of, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, from, 21, grams, of, pitchblende, she, set, 1, 5, grams, aside, and, added, a, tantalum, pentafluoride, taf, 5, carrier, to, the, other, 0, 5, grams, which, she, dissolved, in, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, she, then, boiled, it, in, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, precipitated, what, was, believed, to, be, element, 91, and, verified, that, it, was, an, alpha, emitter, hahn, came, home, on, leave, in, april, and, together, they, devised, a, series, of, tests, to, eliminate, other, sources, of, alpha, particles, the, only, known, ones, with, similar, chemical, behaviour, were, lead, 210, which, decays, to, alpha, emitter, polonium, 210, via, bismuth, 210, and, thorium, 230, for, this, more, pitchblende, was, required, meitner, went, to, vienna, where, she, met, with, stefan, meyer, the, export, of, uranium, from, austria, was, forbidden, due, to, wartime, restrictions, but, meyer, was, able, to, offer, her, a, kilogram, of, uranium, residue, pitchblende, from, which, the, uranium, had, been, removed, which, was, actually, better, for, her, purpose, the, tests, showed, that, the, alpha, activity, was, not, due, to, these, substances, all, that, now, remained, was, to, find, evidence, of, actinium, for, this, yet, more, pitchblende, was, required, but, this, time, meyer, was, unable, to, assist, as, the, export, was, now, prohibited, meitner, managed, to, obtain, 100, g, of, double, residue, pitchblende, without, uranium, or, radium, from, friedrich, oskar, giesel, and, began, tests, with, 43, grams, of, it, but, its, composition, was, different, and, at, first, her, tests, did, not, work, with, giesel, s, help, she, was, able, to, produce, a, pure, product, that, was, strongly, radioactive, by, december, 1917, she, was, able, to, isolate, both, the, mother, isotope, and, its, actinium, daughter, product, she, submitted, their, findings, for, publication, in, march, 1918, although, fajans, and, g, hring, had, been, the, first, to, discover, the, element, custom, required, that, an, element, was, represented, by, its, longest, lived, and, most, abundant, isotope, and, brevium, did, not, seem, appropriate, fajans, agreed, to, meitner, naming, the, element, protoactinium, subsequently, shortened, to, protactinium, and, assigning, it, the, chemical, symbol, pa, in, june, 1918, soddy, and, john, cranston, announced, that, they, had, independently, extracted, a, sample, of, the, isotope, but, unlike, meitner, they, were, unable, to, describe, its, characteristics, they, acknowledged, meitner, s, priority, and, agreed, to, the, name, the, connection, to, uranium, remained, a, mystery, as, neither, of, the, two, known, isotopes, of, uranium, uranium, 234, and, uranium, 238, decayed, into, protactinium, it, remained, unsolved, until, uranium, 235, was, discovered, by, arthur, jeffrey, dempster, in, 1935, in, 1921, meitner, accepted, an, invitation, from, manne, siegbahn, to, come, to, sweden, and, give, a, series, of, lectures, on, radioactivity, as, a, visiting, professor, at, lund, university, she, found, that, very, little, research, had, been, done, on, radioactivity, in, sweden, but, she, was, eager, to, learn, about, x, ray, spectroscopy, which, was, siegbahn, s, specialty, at, his, laboratory, she, met, a, dutch, doctoral, candidate, dirk, coster, who, was, studying, x, ray, spectroscopy, and, his, wife, miep, who, was, working, on, her, doctorate, in, indonesian, language, and, culture, armed, with, her, newly, acquired, knowledge, of, x, ray, spectroscopy, meitner, took, a, fresh, look, at, the, beta, ray, spectra, when, she, returned, to, berlin, it, was, known, that, some, beta, emission, was, primary, with, electrons, being, ejected, directly, from, the, nucleus, and, some, was, secondary, in, which, alpha, particles, from, the, nucleus, knocked, electrons, out, of, orbit, meitner, was, sceptical, of, chadwick, s, claim, that, the, spectral, lines, were, entirely, due, to, secondary, electrons, while, the, primary, ones, formed, a, continuous, spectrum, using, techniques, developed, by, jean, danysz, she, examined, the, spectra, of, lead, 210, radium, 226, and, thorium, 238, meitner, discovered, the, cause, of, the, emission, of, electrons, from, surfaces, of, atoms, with, signature, energies, now, known, as, the, auger, meitner, effect, in, 1922, the, effect, is, co, named, for, pierre, victor, auger, who, independently, discovered, it, in, 1923, women, were, granted, the, right, of, habilitation, in, prussia, in, 1920, and, in, 1922, meitner, was, granted, her, habilitation, and, became, a, privatdozentin, she, was, the, first, woman, to, receive, her, habilitation, in, physics, in, prussia, and, only, the, second, in, germany, after, hedwig, kohn, since, meitner, had, already, published, over, 40, papers, she, was, not, required, to, submit, a, thesis, but, max, von, laue, recommended, that, the, requirement, for, an, inaugural, lecture, not, be, waived, since, he, was, interested, in, what, she, had, to, say, she, therefore, gave, an, inaugural, lecture, on, problems, of, cosmic, physics, from, 1923, to, 1933, she, taught, a, colloquium, or, tutorial, at, friedrich, wilhelm, university, each, semester, and, supervised, doctoral, students, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, in, 1926, she, became, an, au, erordentlicher, professor, extraordinary, professor, the, first, woman, university, physics, professor, in, germany, her, physics, section, became, larger, and, she, acquired, a, permanent, assistant, scientists, from, germany, and, around, the, world, came, to, the, kwi, for, chemistry, to, conduct, research, under, her, supervision, in, 1930, meitner, taught, a, seminar, on, questions, of, atomic, physics, and, atomic, chemistry, with, le, szil, rd, meitner, had, a, wilson, cloud, chamber, constructed, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, the, first, one, in, berlin, and, with, her, student, kurt, freitag, studied, the, tracks, of, alpha, particles, that, did, not, collide, with, a, nucleus, with, her, assistant, kurt, philipp, she, later, used, it, to, take, the, first, images, of, positron, traces, from, gamma, radiation, she, proved, chadwick, s, assertion, that, the, discrete, spectral, lines, were, entirely, the, result, of, secondary, electrons, and, the, continuous, spectra, were, therefore, indeed, entirely, caused, by, the, primary, ones, in, 1927, charles, drummond, ellis, and, william, alfred, wooster, measured, the, energy, of, the, continuous, spectrum, produced, by, the, beta, decay, of, bismuth, 210, at, 0, 34, mev, where, the, energy, of, each, disintegration, was, 0, 35, mev, thus, the, spectrum, accounted, for, nearly, but, not, all, of, the, energy, meitner, found, this, result, so, troubling, that, she, repeated, the, experiment, with, wilhelm, orthmann, using, an, improved, method, and, verified, ellis, and, wooster, s, results, it, appeared, that, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, did, not, hold, for, beta, decay, something, meitner, regarded, as, unacceptable, in, 1930, wolfgang, pauli, wrote, an, open, letter, to, meitner, and, hans, geiger, in, which, he, proposed, that, the, continuous, spectrum, was, caused, by, the, emission, of, a, second, particle, during, beta, decay, one, that, had, no, electric, charge, and, little, or, no, rest, mass, the, idea, was, taken, up, by, enrico, fermi, in, his, 1934, theory, of, beta, decay, and, he, gave, the, name, neutrino, to, the, hypothetical, neutral, particle, at, the, time, there, was, scant, hope, of, detecting, neutrinos, but, in, 1956, clyde, cowan, and, frederick, reines, did, just, that, adolf, hitler, was, sworn, in, as, the, chancellor, of, germany, on, 30, january, 1933, as, his, nazi, party, nsdap, was, now, the, largest, party, in, the, reichstag, the, 7, april, 1933, law, for, the, restoration, of, the, professional, civil, service, removed, jews, from, the, civil, service, which, included, academia, meitner, never, tried, to, conceal, her, jewish, descent, but, initially, was, exempt, from, its, impact, on, multiple, grounds, she, had, been, employed, before, 1914, had, served, in, the, military, during, the, world, war, was, an, austrian, rather, than, a, german, citizen, and, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, was, a, government, industry, partnership, however, she, was, dismissed, from, her, adjunct, professorship, on, 6, september, on, the, grounds, that, her, world, war, i, service, was, not, at, the, front, and, she, had, not, completed, her, habilitation, until, 1922, this, had, no, effect, on, her, salary, or, work, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, carl, bosch, the, director, of, ig, farben, a, major, sponsor, of, the, kwi, for, chemistry, assured, meitner, that, her, position, there, was, safe, although, hahn, and, meitner, remained, in, charge, their, assistants, otto, erbacher, and, kurt, philipp, respectively, who, were, both, nsdap, members, were, given, increasing, influence, over, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, institute, others, were, not, so, fortunate, her, nephew, otto, robert, frisch, was, dismissed, from, his, post, in, the, institute, for, physical, chemistry, at, the, university, of, hamburg, as, was, otto, stern, the, director, of, the, institute, stern, found, frisch, a, position, with, patrick, blackett, at, birkbeck, college, in, england, and, he, later, worked, at, the, niels, bohr, institute, in, copenhagen, from, 1934, to, 1939, fritz, strassman, had, come, to, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, to, study, under, hahn, to, improve, his, employment, prospects, he, declined, a, lucrative, offer, of, employment, because, it, required, political, training, and, nazi, party, membership, and, resigned, from, the, society, of, german, chemists, when, it, became, part, of, the, nazi, german, labour, front, rather, than, become, a, member, of, a, nazi, controlled, organisation, as, a, result, he, could, neither, work, in, the, chemical, industry, nor, receive, his, habilitation, meitner, persuaded, hahn, to, hire, him, as, an, assistant, soon, he, would, be, credited, as, a, third, collaborator, on, the, papers, they, produced, and, would, sometimes, even, be, listed, first, between, 1933, and, 1935, meitner, published, exclusively, in, the, journal, naturwissenschaften, as, its, editor, arnold, berliner, was, jewish, and, he, continued, to, accept, submissions, from, jewish, scientists, this, generated, a, boycott, of, the, publication, and, in, august, 1935, the, publisher, springer, verlag, fired, berliner, after, chadwick, discovered, the, neutron, in, 1932, ir, ne, curie, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, irradiated, aluminium, foil, with, alpha, particles, and, found, that, this, results, in, a, short, lived, radioactive, isotope, of, phosphorus, they, noted, that, positron, emission, continued, after, the, irradiation, ceased, not, only, had, they, discovered, a, new, form, of, radioactive, decay, they, had, transmuted, an, element, into, a, hitherto, unknown, radioactive, isotope, of, another, thereby, inducing, radioactivity, where, there, had, been, none, before, radiochemistry, was, now, no, longer, confined, to, certain, heavy, elements, but, extended, to, the, entire, periodic, table, chadwick, noted, that, being, electrically, neutral, neutrons, could, penetrate, the, nucleus, more, easily, than, protons, or, alpha, particles, enrico, fermi, and, his, colleagues, in, rome, picked, up, on, this, idea, and, began, irradiating, elements, with, neutrons, the, radioactive, displacement, law, of, fajans, and, soddy, said, that, beta, decay, causes, isotopes, to, move, one, element, up, on, the, periodic, table, and, alpha, decay, causes, them, to, move, two, down, when, fermi, s, group, bombarded, uranium, atoms, with, neutrons, they, found, a, complex, mix, of, half, lives, fermi, therefore, concluded, that, new, elements, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 92, known, as, transuranium, elements, had, been, created, meitner, and, hahn, had, not, collaborated, for, many, years, but, meitner, was, eager, to, investigate, fermi, s, results, hahn, initially, was, not, but, he, changed, his, mind, when, aristid, von, grosse, suggested, that, what, fermi, had, found, was, an, isotope, of, protactinium, the, only, question, hahn, later, wrote, seemed, to, be, whether, fermi, had, found, isotopes, of, transuranium, elements, or, isotopes, of, the, next, lower, element, protactinium, at, that, time, lise, meitner, and, i, decided, to, repeat, fermi, s, experiments, in, order, to, find, out, whether, the, 13, minute, isotope, was, a, protactinium, isotope, or, not, it, was, a, logical, decision, having, been, the, discoverers, of, protactinium, between, 1934, and, 1938, hahn, meitner, and, strassmann, found, a, great, number, of, radioactive, transmutation, products, all, of, which, they, regarded, as, transuranic, at, that, time, the, existence, of, actinides, was, not, yet, established, and, uranium, was, wrongly, believed, to, be, a, group, 6, element, similar, to, tungsten, it, followed, that, the, first, transuranic, elements, would, be, similar, to, group, 7, to, 10, elements, rhenium, and, platinoids, they, established, the, presence, of, multiple, isotopes, of, at, least, four, such, elements, and, mistakenly, identified, them, as, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 93, to, 96, they, were, the, first, scientists, to, measure, the, 23, minute, half, life, of, the, synthetic, radioisotope, uranium, 239, and, to, establish, chemically, that, it, was, an, isotope, of, uranium, but, with, their, weak, neutron, sources, they, were, unable, to, continue, this, work, to, its, logical, conclusion, and, identify, the, real, element, 93, they, identified, ten, different, half, lives, with, varying, degrees, of, certainty, to, account, for, them, meitner, had, to, hypothesise, a, new, class, of, reaction, and, the, alpha, decay, of, uranium, neither, of, which, had, ever, been, reported, before, and, for, which, physical, evidence, was, lacking, hahn, and, strassmann, refined, their, chemical, procedures, while, meitner, devised, new, experiments, to, examine, the, reaction, processes, in, may, 1937, hahn, and, meitner, issued, parallel, reports, one, in, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, with, meitner, as, the, first, author, and, one, in, chemische, berichte, with, hahn, as, the, first, author, hahn, concluded, his, by, stating, emphatically, vor, allem, steht, ihre, chemische, verschiedenheit, von, allen, bisher, bekannten, elementen, au, erhalb, jeder, diskussion, above, all, their, chemical, distinction, from, all, previously, known, elements, needs, no, further, discussion, meitner, was, increasingly, uncertain, she, considered, the, possibility, that, the, reactions, were, from, different, isotopes, of, uranium, three, were, known, uranium, 238, uranium, 235, and, uranium, 234, however, when, she, calculated, the, neutron, cross, section, it, was, too, large, to, be, anything, other, than, the, most, abundant, isotope, uranium, 238, and, concluded, that, it, must, be, another, case, of, nuclear, isomerism, a, phenomenon, hahn, had, discovered, in, protactinium, years, before, she, therefore, ended, her, report, on, a, very, different, note, to, hahn, reporting, that, the, process, must, be, neutron, capture, by, uranium, 238, which, leads, to, three, isomeric, nuclei, of, uranium, 239, this, result, is, very, difficult, to, reconcile, with, current, concepts, of, the, nucleus, with, the, anschluss, germany, s, annexation, of, austria, on, 12, march, 1938, meitner, lost, her, austrian, citizenship, niels, bohr, extended, an, offer, to, lecture, in, copenhagen, and, paul, scherrer, invited, her, to, attend, a, congress, in, switzerland, with, all, expenses, paid, carl, bosch, still, said, that, she, could, remain, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, but, by, may, she, was, aware, that, the, reich, ministry, of, science, education, and, culture, was, looking, into, her, case, on, 9, may, she, decided, to, accept, bohr, s, invitation, to, go, to, copenhagen, where, frisch, worked, but, when, she, went, to, the, danish, consulate, to, get, a, travel, visa, she, was, told, that, denmark, no, longer, recognised, her, austrian, passport, as, valid, she, could, not, leave, for, denmark, switzerland, or, any, other, country, bohr, came, to, berlin, in, june, and, was, gravely, concerned, when, he, returned, to, copenhagen, he, began, looking, for, a, position, for, meitner, in, scandinavia, he, also, asked, hans, kramers, to, see, if, anything, was, available, in, the, netherlands, kramers, contacted, coster, who, in, turn, notified, adriaan, fokker, coster, and, fokker, attempted, to, secure, a, position, for, meitner, at, the, university, of, groningen, they, found, that, the, rockefeller, foundation, would, not, support, refugee, scientists, and, that, the, international, federation, of, university, women, had, been, flooded, with, applications, for, support, from, austria, on, 27, june, meitner, received, an, offer, of, a, one, year, position, at, manne, siegbahn, s, new, manne, siegbahn, laboratory, in, stockholm, then, under, construction, which, would, be, devoted, to, nuclear, physics, and, she, decided, to, accept, it, but, on, 4, july, she, learned, that, academics, would, no, longer, be, granted, permission, to, travel, abroad, through, bohr, in, copenhagen, peter, debye, communicated, with, coster, and, fokker, and, they, approached, the, netherlands, ministry, of, education, with, an, appeal, to, allow, meitner, to, come, to, the, netherlands, as, foreigners, were, not, allowed, to, work, for, pay, an, appointment, as, a, non, salaried, privaat, docente, was, required, wander, johannes, de, haas, and, anton, eduard, van, arkel, arranged, for, one, at, leiden, university, coster, also, spoke, to, the, head, of, the, border, guards, who, assured, him, that, meitner, would, be, admitted, a, friend, of, coster, e, h, ebels, was, a, local, politician, from, the, border, area, and, he, spoke, directly, to, the, guards, on, the, border, on, 11, july, coster, arrived, in, berlin, where, he, stayed, with, debye, the, following, morning, meitner, arrived, early, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, and, hahn, briefed, her, on, the, plan, to, avoid, suspicion, she, maintained, her, usual, routine, remaining, at, the, institute, until, 20, 00, correcting, one, of, the, associate, s, papers, for, publication, hahn, and, paul, rosbaud, helped, her, pack, two, small, suitcases, carrying, only, summer, clothes, hahn, gave, her, a, diamond, ring, he, had, inherited, from, his, mother, in, case, of, emergency, she, took, only, 10, marks, in, her, purse, equivalent, to, 40, in, 2021, she, then, spent, the, night, at, hahn, s, house, the, next, morning, meitner, met, coster, at, the, railway, station, where, they, pretended, to, have, met, by, chance, they, travelled, on, a, lightly, used, line, to, bad, nieuweschans, railway, station, on, the, border, which, they, crossed, without, incident, the, german, border, guards, may, have, thought, that, meitner, was, the, wife, of, a, professor, a, telegram, from, pauli, informed, coster, that, he, was, now, as, famous, for, the, abduction, of, lise, meitner, as, for, the, discovery, of, hafnium, meitner, learned, on, 26, july, that, sweden, had, granted, her, permission, to, enter, on, her, austrian, passport, and, two, days, later, she, flew, to, copenhagen, where, she, was, greeted, by, frisch, and, stayed, with, niels, and, margrethe, bohr, at, their, holiday, house, in, tisvilde, on, 1, august, she, travelled, by, train, and, steamship, to, g, teborg, station, in, sweden, where, she, was, met, at, by, eva, von, bahr, they, took, a, train, and, then, a, steamer, to, von, bahr, s, home, in, kung, lv, where, she, stayed, until, september, hahn, told, everyone, at, the, kwi, for, chemistry, that, meitner, had, gone, to, vienna, to, visit, her, relatives, and, a, few, days, later, the, institute, had, closed, for, the, summer, on, 23, august, she, wrote, to, bosch, requesting, retirement, he, tried, to, ship, her, belongings, to, sweden, but, the, reich, ministry, of, education, insisted, they, remain, in, germany, meitner, was, also, concerned, about, her, family, in, austria, one, of, her, first, actions, in, sweden, was, to, apply, for, a, swedish, immigration, permit, for, gusti, and, her, husband, justinian, jutz, frisch, hahn, selected, josef, mattauch, to, replace, her, as, head, of, the, physics, section, and, went, to, vienna, to, offer, him, the, job, while, there, he, dined, with, meitner, s, sisters, gusti, and, gisela, and, their, husbands, jutz, frisch, and, karl, lion, on, 9, november, the, next, day, gusti, informed, him, that, frisch, had, been, arrested, that, day, meitner, arrived, in, copenhagen, arranging, a, travel, visa, had, been, difficult, with, her, invalid, austrian, passport, hahn, joined, her, in, copenhagen, on, 13, november, and, had, discussions, about, the, uranium, research, with, meitner, bohr, and, otto, robert, frisch, hahn, and, strassmann, isolated, the, three, radium, isotopes, verified, by, their, half, lives, and, used, fractional, crystallisation, to, separate, it, from, its, barium, carrier, by, adding, barium, bromide, crystals, in, four, steps, since, radium, precipitates, preferentially, in, a, solution, of, barium, bromide, at, each, step, the, fraction, drawn, off, would, contain, less, radium, than, the, one, before, however, they, found, no, difference, between, each, of, the, fractions, in, case, their, process, was, faulty, in, some, way, they, verified, it, with, known, isotopes, of, radium, the, process, was, fine, on, 19, december, hahn, wrote, to, meitner, informing, her, that, the, radium, isotopes, behaved, chemically, like, barium, anxious, to, finish, up, before, the, christmas, break, hahn, and, strassmann, submitted, their, findings, to, naturwissenschaften, on, 22, december, without, waiting, for, meitner, to, reply, hahn, concluded, the, paper, with, as, chemists, we, should, substitute, the, symbols, ba, la, ce, for, ra, ac, th, as, nuclear, chemists, fairly, close, to, physics, we, cannot, yet, bring, ourselves, to, take, this, step, which, contradicts, all, previous, experience, in, physics, frisch, normally, celebrated, christmas, with, meitner, in, berlin, but, in, 1938, she, accepted, an, invitation, from, eva, von, bahr, to, spend, it, with, her, family, at, kung, lv, and, meitner, asked, frisch, to, join, her, there, meitner, received, the, letter, from, hahn, describing, his, chemical, proof, that, some, of, the, product, of, the, bombardment, of, uranium, with, neutrons, was, barium, barium, had, an, atomic, mass, 40, less, than, uranium, and, no, previously, known, methods, of, radioactive, decay, could, account, for, such, a, large, difference, in, the, mass, of, the, nucleus, nonetheless, she, had, immediately, written, back, to, hahn, to, say, at, the, moment, the, assumption, of, such, a, thoroughgoing, breakup, seems, very, difficult, to, me, but, in, nuclear, physics, we, have, experienced, so, many, surprises, that, one, cannot, unconditionally, say, it, is, impossible, meitner, dismissed, the, possibility, that, hahn, s, identification, of, barium, was, in, error, her, faith, in, hahn, s, expertise, as, a, chemist, was, absolute, meitner, and, frisch, then, considered, how, it, could, be, possible, previous, attempts, at, atom, splitting, had, never, had, enough, energy, to, chip, away, more, than, individual, protons, or, alpha, particles, but, a, barium, nucleus, was, much, larger, they, considered, the, liquid, drop, model, of, the, nucleus, that, had, been, proposed, by, george, gamow, perhaps, it, was, possible, for, a, drop, to, become, elongated, and, then, divide, itself, in, two, frisch, later, wrote, at, that, point, we, both, sat, down, on, a, tree, trunk, all, that, discussion, had, taken, place, while, we, walked, through, the, wood, in, the, snow, i, with, my, skis, on, lise, meitner, making, good, her, claim, that, she, could, walk, just, as, fast, without, and, started, to, calculate, on, scraps, of, paper, the, charge, of, a, uranium, nucleus, we, found, was, indeed, large, enough, to, overcome, the, effect, of, the, surface, tension, almost, completely, so, the, uranium, nucleus, might, indeed, resemble, a, very, wobbly, unstable, drop, ready, to, divide, itself, at, the, slightest, provocation, such, as, the, impact, of, a, single, neutron, but, there, was, another, problem, after, separation, the, two, drops, would, be, driven, apart, by, their, mutual, electric, repulsion, and, would, acquire, high, speed, and, hence, a, very, large, energy, about, 200, mev, in, all, where, could, that, energy, come, from, fortunately, lise, meitner, remembered, the, empirical, formula, for, computing, the, masses, of, nuclei, and, worked, out, that, the, two, nuclei, formed, by, the, division, of, a, uranium, nucleus, together, would, be, lighter, than, the, original, uranium, nucleus, by, about, one, fifth, the, mass, of, a, proton, now, whenever, mass, disappears, energy, is, created, according, to, einstein, s, formula, e, mc, 2, and, one, fifth, of, a, proton, mass, was, just, equivalent, to, 200, mev, so, here, was, the, source, for, that, energy, it, all, fitted, meitner, and, frisch, had, correctly, interpreted, hahn, s, results, to, mean, that, the, nucleus, of, uranium, had, split, roughly, in, half, the, first, two, reactions, that, the, berlin, group, had, observed, were, light, elements, created, by, the, breakup, of, uranium, nuclei, the, third, the, 23, minute, one, was, a, decay, into, the, real, element, 93, on, returning, to, copenhagen, frisch, informed, bohr, who, slapped, his, forehead, and, exclaimed, what, idiots, we, have, been, bohr, promised, not, to, say, anything, until, they, had, a, paper, ready, for, publication, to, speed, the, process, they, decided, to, submit, a, one, page, note, to, nature, at, this, point, the, only, evidence, that, they, had, was, the, barium, logically, if, barium, was, formed, the, other, element, must, be, krypton, but, hahn, had, mistakenly, believed, that, the, atomic, masses, had, to, add, up, to, 239, rather, than, the, atomic, numbers, adding, up, to, 92, and, thought, it, was, masurium, technetium, and, so, did, not, check, for, it, over, a, series, of, long, distance, phone, calls, meitner, and, frisch, came, up, with, a, simple, experiment, to, bolster, their, claim, to, measure, the, recoil, of, the, fission, fragments, using, a, geiger, counter, with, the, threshold, set, above, that, of, the, alpha, particles, frisch, conducted, the, experiment, on, 13, january, and, found, the, pulses, caused, by, the, reaction, just, as, they, had, predicted, he, decided, he, needed, a, name, for, the, newly, discovered, nuclear, process, he, spoke, to, william, a, arnold, an, american, biologist, working, with, george, de, hevesy, and, asked, him, what, biologists, called, the, process, by, which, living, cells, divided, into, two, arnold, told, him, that, biologists, called, it, fission, frisch, then, applied, that, name, to, the, nuclear, process, in, his, paper, he, mailed, both, papers, to, nature, on, 16, january, the, jointly, authored, note, appeared, in, print, on, 11, february, and, frisch, s, paper, on, recoil, on, 18, february, these, three, reports, the, first, hahn, strassmann, publications, of, 6, january, and, 10, february, 1939, and, the, frisch, meitner, publication, of, 11, february, 1939, had, electrifying, effects, on, the, scientific, community, in, 1940, frisch, and, rudolf, peierls, produced, the, frisch, peierls, memorandum, which, established, that, an, atomic, explosion, could, be, generated, despite, the, many, honours, that, meitner, received, in, her, lifetime, she, did, not, receive, the, nobel, prize, while, it, was, awarded, to, otto, hahn, for, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, she, was, nominated, 49, times, for, physics, and, chemistry, nobel, prizes, but, never, won, on, 15, november, 1945, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, announced, that, hahn, had, been, awarded, the, 1944, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, discovery, of, the, fission, of, heavy, atomic, nuclei, meitner, was, the, one, who, told, hahn, and, strassman, to, test, their, radium, in, more, detail, and, it, was, she, who, told, hahn, that, it, was, possible, for, the, nucleus, of, uranium, to, disintegrate, without, these, contributions, of, meitner, hahn, would, not, have, found, that, the, uranium, nucleus, can, split, in, half, in, 1945, the, nobel, committee, for, chemistry, in, sweden, that, selected, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, decided, to, award, that, prize, solely, to, hahn, who, found, out, from, a, newspaper, while, detained, in, farm, hall, in, england, in, the, 1990s, the, long, sealed, records, of, the, nobel, committee, s, proceedings, became, public, and, the, comprehensive, biography, of, meitner, published, in, 1996, by, ruth, lewin, sime, took, advantage, of, this, unsealing, to, reconsider, meitner, s, exclusion, in, a, 1997, article, in, the, american, physical, society, journal, physics, today, sime, and, her, colleagues, elisabeth, crawford, and, mark, walker, wrote, it, appears, that, lise, meitner, did, not, share, the, 1944, prize, because, the, structure, of, the, nobel, committees, was, ill, suited, to, assess, interdisciplinary, work, because, the, members, of, the, chemistry, committee, were, unable, or, unwilling, to, judge, her, contribution, fairly, and, because, during, the, war, the, swedish, scientists, relied, on, their, own, limited, expertise, meitner, s, exclusion, from, the, chemistry, award, may, well, be, summarized, as, a, mixture, of, disciplinary, bias, political, obtuseness, ignorance, and, haste, max, perutz, the, 1962, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, winner, reached, a, similar, conclusion, having, been, locked, up, in, the, nobel, committee, s, files, these, fifty, years, the, documents, leading, to, this, unjust, award, now, reveal, that, the, protracted, deliberations, by, the, nobel, jury, were, hampered, by, lack, of, appreciation, both, of, the, joint, work, that, had, preceded, the, discovery, and, of, meitner, s, written, and, verbal, contributions, after, her, flight, from, berlin, the, five, member, physics, committee, included, manne, siegbahn, his, former, student, erik, hulth, n, the, professor, of, experimental, physics, at, uppsala, university, and, axel, lindh, who, eventually, succeeded, hulth, n, all, three, were, part, of, the, siegbahn, school, of, x, ray, spectroscopy, the, poor, relationship, between, siegbahn, and, meitner, was, a, factor, here, as, was, the, bias, towards, experimental, rather, than, theoretical, physics, in, his, report, on, the, work, of, meitner, and, frisch, hulth, n, relied, on, pre, war, papers, he, did, not, think, that, their, work, was, groundbreaking, and, argued, that, the, prize, for, physics, was, given, for, experimental, rather, than, theoretical, work, which, had, not, been, the, case, for, many, years, at, the, time, meitner, herself, wrote, in, a, letter, surely, hahn, fully, deserved, the, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, there, is, really, no, doubt, about, it, but, i, believe, that, frisch, and, i, contributed, something, not, insignificant, to, the, clarification, of, the, process, of, uranium, fission, how, it, originates, and, that, it, produces, so, much, energy, and, that, was, something, very, remote, to, hahn, hahn, s, nobel, prize, was, long, expected, both, he, and, meitner, had, been, nominated, for, both, the, chemistry, and, the, physics, prizes, several, times, even, before, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, according, to, the, nobel, prize, archive, she, was, nominated, 19, times, for, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, between, 1924, and, 1948, and, 30, times, for, nobel, prize, in, physics, between, 1937, and, 1967, her, nominators, included, arthur, compton, dirk, coster, kasimir, fajans, james, franck, otto, hahn, oscar, klein, niels, bohr, max, planck, and, max, born, despite, not, having, been, awarded, the, nobel, prize, meitner, was, invited, to, attend, the, lindau, nobel, laureate, meeting, in, 1962, meitner, found, that, siegbahn, did, not, want, her, at, the, time, the, offer, to, come, to, sweden, had, been, extended, he, had, said, that, he, had, no, money, and, could, only, offer, meitner, a, place, to, work, eva, von, bahr, had, then, written, to, carl, wilhelm, oseen, who, had, provided, money, from, the, nobel, foundation, this, left, her, with, laboratory, space, but, now, she, had, to, perform, work, that, she, had, been, able, to, delegate, to, her, laboratory, technicians, for, the, previous, twenty, years, ruth, lewin, sime, wrote, that, in, sweden, there, was, no, general, sympathy, for, refugees, from, nazi, germany, the, country, was, small, with, a, weak, economy, and, no, immigrant, tradition, and, its, academic, culture, had, always, been, firmly, pro, german, a, tradition, that, did, not, change, much, until, the, middle, of, the, war, when, it, became, obvious, that, germany, would, not, win, during, the, war, members, of, siegbahn, s, group, saw, meitner, as, an, outsider, withdrawn, and, depressed, they, did, not, understand, the, displacement, and, anxiety, common, to, all, refugees, or, the, trauma, of, losing, friends, and, relatives, to, the, holocaust, or, the, exceptional, isolation, of, a, woman, who, had, single, mindedly, devoted, her, life, to, her, work, on, 14, january, 1939, meitner, learned, that, her, brother, in, law, jutz, had, been, released, from, dachau, and, he, and, her, sister, gusti, were, permitted, to, emigrate, to, sweden, jutz, s, boss, gottfried, bermann, had, escaped, to, sweden, and, he, offered, jutz, his, old, job, back, at, the, publishing, firm, if, he, was, able, to, come, niels, bohr, interceded, with, a, swedish, official, justitier, d, alexandersson, who, said, that, jutz, would, receive, a, labour, permit, on, arrival, in, sweden, he, worked, there, until, he, was, pensioned, off, in, 1948, and, then, moved, to, cambridge, to, join, otto, robert, frisch, her, sister, gisela, and, brother, in, law, karl, lion, moved, to, england, and, meitner, also, considered, moving, there, she, visited, cambridge, in, july, 1939, and, accepted, an, offer, from, william, lawrence, bragg, and, john, cockcroft, of, a, position, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, on, a, three, year, contract, with, girton, college, cambridge, but, the, second, world, war, broke, out, in, september, 1939, before, she, could, make, the, move, in, sweden, meitner, continued, her, research, as, best, she, could, she, measured, the, neutron, cross, sections, of, thorium, lead, and, uranium, using, dysprosium, as, a, neutron, detector, an, assay, technique, pioneered, by, george, de, hevesy, and, hilde, levi, she, was, able, to, arrange, for, hedwig, kohn, who, faced, deportation, to, poland, to, come, to, sweden, and, eventually, to, emigrate, to, the, united, states, travelling, via, the, soviet, union, she, was, unsuccessful, in, bringing, stefen, meyer, out, of, germany, but, he, managed, to, survive, the, war, she, declined, an, offer, to, join, frisch, on, the, british, contribution, to, the, manhattan, project, at, the, los, alamos, laboratory, declaring, i, will, have, nothing, to, do, with, a, bomb, she, later, said, that, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, had, come, as, a, surprise, to, her, and, that, she, was, sorry, that, the, bomb, had, to, be, invented, after, the, war, meitner, acknowledged, her, own, moral, failing, in, staying, in, germany, from, 1933, to, 1938, she, wrote, it, was, not, only, stupid, but, very, wrong, that, i, did, not, leave, at, once, she, regretted, her, own, inaction, during, this, period, and, was, also, bitterly, critical, of, hahn, max, von, laue, werner, heisenberg, and, other, german, scientists, in, a, june, 1945, letter, addressed, to, hahn, that, he, never, received, she, wrote, you, all, worked, for, nazi, germany, and, you, did, not, even, try, passive, resistance, granted, to, absolve, your, conscience, you, helped, some, oppressed, person, here, and, there, but, millions, of, innocent, human, beings, were, murdered, and, there, was, no, protest, here, in, neutral, sweden, long, before, the, end, of, the, war, there, was, discussion, of, what, should, be, done, with, german, scholars, once, the, war, is, over, what, then, must, the, english, and, americans, be, thinking, i, and, many, others, are, of, the, opinion, that, the, one, path, for, you, would, be, to, deliver, an, open, statement, that, you, are, aware, that, through, your, passivity, you, share, responsibility, for, what, has, happened, and, that, you, have, the, need, to, work, for, what, can, be, done, to, make, amends, but, many, think, it, is, too, late, for, that, these, people, say, that, first, you, betrayed, your, friends, then, your, men, and, your, children, in, that, you, let, them, stake, their, lives, on, a, criminal, war, and, finally, that, you, betrayed, germany, itself, because, when, the, war, was, already, quite, hopeless, you, never, once, spoke, out, against, the, meaningless, destruction, of, germany, that, sounds, pitiless, but, nevertheless, i, believe, that, the, reason, i, write, this, to, you, is, true, friendship, in, the, last, few, days, one, had, heard, of, the, unbelievably, gruesome, things, in, the, concentration, camps, it, overwhelms, everything, one, previously, feared, when, i, heard, on, english, radio, a, very, detailed, report, by, the, english, and, americans, about, belsen, and, buchenwald, i, began, to, cry, out, loud, and, lay, awake, all, night, and, if, you, had, seen, those, people, who, were, brought, here, from, the, camps, one, should, take, a, man, like, heisenberg, and, millions, like, him, and, force, them, to, look, at, these, camps, and, the, martyred, people, the, way, he, turned, up, in, denmark, in, 1941, is, unforgettable, in, the, aftermath, of, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, meitner, became, a, celebrity, she, had, a, radio, interview, with, eleanor, roosevelt, and, a, few, days, later, another, one, with, a, radio, station, in, new, york, during, which, she, heard, her, sister, frida, s, voice, for, the, first, time, in, years, i, am, of, jewish, descent, she, told, frida, i, am, not, jewish, by, belief, know, nothing, of, the, history, of, judaism, and, do, not, feel, closer, to, jews, than, to, other, people, on, 25, january, 1946, meitner, arrived, in, new, york, where, she, was, greeted, by, her, sisters, lola, and, frida, and, by, frisch, who, had, made, the, two, day, train, trip, from, los, alamos, lola, s, husband, rudolf, allers, arranged, a, visiting, professorship, for, meitner, at, the, catholic, university, of, america, meitner, lectured, at, princeton, university, harvard, university, and, columbia, university, and, discussed, physics, with, albert, einstein, hermann, weyl, tsung, dao, lee, yang, chen, ning, and, isidor, isaac, rabi, she, went, to, durham, north, carolina, and, saw, hertha, sponer, and, hedwig, kohn, and, spent, an, evening, in, washington, dc, with, james, chadwick, who, was, now, the, head, of, the, british, mission, to, the, manhattan, project, she, also, met, the, project, s, director, major, general, leslie, groves, she, spoke, at, smith, college, and, went, to, chicago, where, she, met, enrico, fermi, edward, teller, victor, weisskopf, and, leo, szilard, on, 8, july, meitner, boarded, the, rms, queen, mary, for, england, where, she, met, with, erwin, schr, dinger, wolfgang, pauli, and, max, born, there, were, belated, celebrations, for, the, 300th, birthday, of, isaac, newton, but, the, only, german, invited, to, attend, was, max, planck, for, her, friends, in, sweden, siegbahn, s, opposition, to, meitner, s, nobel, prize, was, the, final, straw, and, they, resolved, to, get, her, a, better, position, in, 1947, meitner, moved, to, the, royal, institute, of, technology, kth, in, stockholm, where, gudmund, borelius, established, a, new, facility, for, atomic, research, there, had, been, scant, nuclear, physics, research, in, sweden, which, was, blamed, on, siegbahn, s, lack, of, support, for, meitner, s, work, and, now, such, knowledge, seemed, vital, for, sweden, s, future, at, the, kth, meitner, had, three, rooms, two, assistants, and, access, to, technicians, with, the, sigvard, eklund, occupying, the, room, next, door, the, intention, was, that, meitner, would, have, the, salary, and, title, of, a, research, professor, one, without, teaching, duties, the, professorship, fell, through, when, the, minister, for, education, tage, erlander, unexpectedly, became, the, prime, minister, of, sweden, in, 1946, but, borelius, and, klein, ensured, that, she, had, the, salary, of, a, professor, if, not, the, title, in, 1949, she, became, a, swedish, citizen, but, without, surrendering, her, austrian, citizenship, thanks, to, a, special, act, passed, by, the, riksdag, plans, were, approved, for, r1, sweden, s, first, nuclear, reactor, in, 1947, with, eklund, as, the, project, director, and, meitner, worked, with, him, on, its, design, and, construction, in, her, last, scientific, papers, in, 1950, and, 1951, she, applied, magic, numbers, to, nuclear, fission, she, retired, in, 1960, and, moved, to, the, uk, where, many, of, her, relatives, were, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, meitner, enjoyed, visiting, germany, and, staying, with, hahn, and, his, family, for, several, days, on, different, occasions, hahn, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, he, and, meitner, had, remained, lifelong, close, friends, even, though, their, friendship, was, full, of, trials, arguably, more, so, experienced, by, meitner, she, never, voiced, anything, but, deep, affection, for, hahn, on, occasions, such, as, their, 70th, 75th, 80th, and, 85th, birthdays, they, addressed, recollections, in, each, other, s, honour, hahn, emphasised, meitner, s, intellectual, productivity, and, work, such, as, her, research, on, the, nuclear, shell, model, always, passing, over, the, reasons, for, her, move, to, sweden, as, quickly, as, possible, she, emphasised, hahn, s, personal, qualities, his, charm, and, musical, ability, a, strenuous, trip, to, the, united, states, in, 1964, led, to, meitner, having, a, heart, attack, which, she, spent, several, months, recovering, from, her, physical, and, mental, condition, was, weakened, by, atherosclerosis, after, breaking, her, hip, in, a, fall, and, suffering, several, small, strokes, in, 1967, meitner, made, a, partial, recovery, but, was, eventually, weakened, to, the, point, where, she, had, to, move, into, a, cambridge, nursing, home, meitner, died, in, her, sleep, on, 27, october, 1968, at, the, age, of, 89, she, was, not, informed, of, the, deaths, of, otto, hahn, on, 28, july, 1968, or, his, wife, edith, on, 14, august, as, her, family, believed, it, would, be, too, much, for, someone, so, frail, as, was, her, wish, she, was, buried, in, the, village, of, bramley, in, hampshire, at, st, james, parish, church, close, to, her, younger, brother, walter, who, had, died, in, 1964, her, nephew, frisch, composed, the, inscription, on, her, headstone, it, reads, lise, meitner, a, physicist, who, never, lost, her, humanity, meitner, was, praised, by, albert, einstein, as, the, german, marie, curie, on, her, visit, to, the, us, in, 1946, she, received, the, honour,

palace, in, vienna, it, was, the, first, time, that, this, prize, had, been, awarded, to, non, americans, and, the, first, time, it, was, presented, to, a, woman, meitner, s, diploma, bore, the, words, for, pioneering, research, in, the, naturally, occurring, radioactivities, and, extensive, experimental, studies, leading, to, the, discovery, of, fission, hahn, s, diploma, was, slightly, different, for, pioneering, research, in, the, naturally, occurring, radioactivities, and, extensive, experimental, studies, culminating, in, the, discovery, of, fission, hahn, and, strassmann, were, present, but, meitner, was, too, ill, to, attend, so, frisch, accepted, the, award, on, her, behalf, glenn, seaborg, the, discoverer, of, plutonium, presented, it, to, her, in, the, home, of, max,
