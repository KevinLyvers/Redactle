the, symptoms, he, had, it, s, unlikely, that, artaud, actually, contracted, it, artaud, attended, the, coll, ge, sacr, coeur, a, catholic, middle, and, high, school, from, 1907, to, 1914, at, school,

dullin, s, teaching, and, they, shared, a, strong, interest, in, east, asian, theater, specifically, performance, traditions, from, bali, and, japan, 10, he, stated, hearing, dullin, teach, i, feel, that, i, m, rediscovering, ancient, secrets, and, a, whole, forgotten, mystique, of, production, 351, however, their, disagreements, increased, over, time, particularly, in, relation, to, the, differing, logics, of, eastern, and, western, theatre, traditions, 351, 2, their, final, disagreement, was, over, his, performance, as, the, emperor, charlemagne, in, alexandre, arnoux, s, huon, de, bordeaux, he, left, the, troupe, in, 1923, after, eighteen, months, as, a, member, 22, 345, shortly, thereafter, he, joined, the, troupe, of, georges, and, ludmilla, pito, ff, he, remained, with, them, through, the, next, year, when, he, shifted, his, focus, to, work, in, the, cinema, 15, 16, in, 1923, artaud, submitted, poems, to, la, nouvelle, revue, fran, aise, nrf, a, prominent, french, literary, journal, the, poems, were, rejected, but, jacques, rivi, re, the, journal, s, editor, found, artaud, intriguing, and, invited, him, for, a, meeting, this, initiated, a, written, correspondence, which, resulted, in, artaud, s, first, major, publication, the, epistolary, work, correspondance, avec, jacques, rivi, re, 45, artaud, continued, to, publish, some, of, his, most, influential, works, in, the, nrf, later, he, would, revise, many, of, these, texts, for, inclusion, i, n, the, theatre, and, its, double, including, the, first, manifesto, for, a, theatre, of, cruelty, 1932, and, theatre, and, the, plague, 1933, 105, artaud, had, an, active, career, in, the, cinema, as, a, critic, actor, and, writer, this, included, his, performance, as, jean, paul, marat, in, abel, gance, s, napol, on, 1927, and, the, monk, massieu, in, carl, theodor, dreyer, s, the, passion, of, joan, of, arc, 1928, 17, artaud, also, wrote, a, number, of, film, scenarios, ten, of, which, have, survived, 23, only, one, of, the, scenarios, was, produced, during, his, lifetime, the, seashell, and, the, clergyman, 1928, directed, by, germaine, dulac, many, critics, and, scholars, consider, it, to, be, the, first, surrealist, film, though, artaud, s, relationship, to, the, resulting, film, was, conflicted, artaud, was, briefly, associated, with, the, surrealists, before, andr, breton, expelled, him, from, the, movement, in, 1927, 21, this, was, in, part, due, to, the, surrealists, increasing, affiliation, with, the, communist, party, in, france, 274, as, ros, murray, notes, artaud, was, not, into, politics, at, all, writing, things, like, i, shit, on, marxism, additionally, breton, was, becoming, very, anti, theatre, because, he, saw, theatre, as, being, bourgeois, and, anti, revolutionary, in, the, manifesto, for, an, abortive, theatre, 1926, 27, written, for, the, theatre, alfred, jarry, artaud, makes, a, direct, attack, on, the, surrealists, whom, he, calls, bog, paper, revolutionaries, that, would, make, us, believe, that, to, produce, theatre, today, is, a, counter, revolutionary, endeavour, 24, he, declares, they, are, bowing, down, to, communism, 25, which, is, a, lazy, man, s, revolution, 24, and, calls, for, a, more, essential, metamorphosis, of, society, 25, in, 1926, artaud, robert, aron, and, the, expelled, surrealist, roger, vitrac, founded, the, th, tre, alfred, jarry, taj, they, staged, four, productions, between, june, 1927, and, january, 1929, the, theatre, was, extremely, short, lived, but, was, attended, by, an, enormous, range, of, european, artists, including, arthur, adamov, andr, gide, and, paul, val, ry, 249, for, more, details, including, a, full, list, of, productions, see, th, tre, alfred, jarry, in, 1931, artaud, saw, balinese, dance, performed, at, the, paris, colonial, exposition, although, he, misunderstood, much, of, what, he, saw, it, influenced, his, ideas, for, theatre, 26, adrian, curtin, has, noted, the, significance, of, the, balinese, use, of, music, and, sound, for, artaud, and, particularly, the, hypnotic, rhythms, of, the, gamelan, ensemble, its, range, of, percussive, effects, the, variety, of, timbres, that, the, musicians, produced, and, most, importantly, perhaps, the, way, in, which, the, dancers, movements, interacted, dynamically, with, the, musical, elements, instead, of, simply, functioning, as, a, type, of, background, accompaniment, 253, in, 1935, artaud, staged, an, original, adaptation, of, percy, bysshe, shelley, s, the, cenci, at, the, th, tre, des, folies, wagram, in, paris, the, drama, was, artaud, s, first, and, only, chance, to, stage, a, production, following, his, manifestos, for, a, theatre, of, cruelty, 250, it, had, a, set, designed, by, balthus, and, employed, innovative, sound, effects, including, the, first, theatrical, use, of, the, electronic, instrument, the, ondes, martenot, it, was, however, a, commercial, failure, while, shelley, s, version, of, the, cenci, conveyed, the, motivations, and, anguish, of, the, cenci, s, daughter, beatrice, with, her, father, through, monologues, artaud, s, adaptation, emphasized, the, play, s, cruelty, and, violence, in, particular, its, themes, of, incest, revenge, and, familial, murder, 21, artaud, was, concerned, with, conveying, the, menacing, nature, of, the, cenci, s, presence, and, the, reverberations, of, their, incest, relationship, though, physical, discordance, as, if, an, invisible, force, field, surrounded, them, 123, artaud, s, opening, stage, directions, demonstrate, his, approach, he, describes, the, opening, scene, as, suggestive, of, extreme, atmospheric, turbulence, with, wind, blown, drapes, waves, of, suddenly, amplified, sound, and, crowds, of, figures, engaged, in, furious, orgy, accompanied, by, a, chorus, of, church, bells, as, well, as, the, presence, of, numerous, large, mannequins, 120, scholar, jane, goodall, writes, of, the, cenci, the, predominance, of, action, over, reflection, accelerates, the, development, of, events, the, monologues, are, cut, in, favor, of, sudden, jarring, transitions, so, that, a, spasmodic, effect, is, created, extreme, fluctuations, in, pace, pitch, and, tone, heighten, sensory, awareness, intensify, the, here, and, now, of, performance, 119, scholar, adrian, curtin, has, argued, for, the, importance, of, the, sonic, aspects, of, the, production, which, did, not, merely, support, the, action, but, motivated, it, obliquely, 251, in, 1938, artaud, published, the, theatre, and, its, double, one, of, his, most, important, texts, 34, in, it, he, proposed, a, theatre, that, was, in, effect, a, return, to, magic, and, ritual, and, he, sought, to, create, a, new, theatrical, language, of, totem, and, gesture, a, language, of, space, devoid, of, dialogue, that, would, appeal, to, all, the, senses, 6, the, theatre, of, cruelty, he, theorized, in, the, text, abandoned, the, formal, proscenium, arch, and, dominance, of, the, playwright, which, he, considered, a, hindrance, to, the, magic, of, genuine, ritual, in, favor, of, violent, physical, images, which, would, crush, and, hypnotize, the, sensibility, of, the, spectator, who, would, be, seized, by, the, theatre, as, by, a, whirlwind, of, higher, forces, 6, in, 1935, artaud, decided, to, go, to, mexico, where, he, was, convinced, there, was, a, sort, of, deep, movement, in, favour, of, a, return, to, civilisation, before, cortez, 11, the, mexican, legation, in, paris, gave, him, a, travel, grant, and, he, left, for, mexico, in, january, 1936, after, arriving, the, following, month, he, became, something, of, a, fixture, in, the, mexican, art, scene, though, he, was, often, under, the, influence, of, opiates, and, spent, much, of, his, time, seated, and, immobile, cual, momia, 29, 30, 73, artaud, also, lived, in, norogachic, a, rar, muri, village, in, the, sierra, tarahumara, 77, he, claimed, to, have, participated, in, peyote, rites, though, scholars, have, questioned, this, during, this, time, he, stopped, using, opiates, and, suffered, withdrawal, 77, in, 1937, artaud, returned, to, france, where, his, friend, ren, thomas, gave, him, a, walking, stick, of, knotted, wood, that, artaud, believed, was, the, most, sacred, relic, of, the, irish, church, the, bachall, su, or, staff, of, jesus, and, contained, magical, powers, 32, artaud, traveled, to, ireland, landing, at, cobh, and, travelling, to, galway, possibly, in, an, effort, to, return, the, staff, speaking, very, little, english, and, no, gaelic, whatsoever, he, was, unable, to, make, himself, understood, 33, in, dublin, artaud, found, himself, penniless, and, spent, most, of, his, trip, in, hostels, for, the, homeless, 34, after, several, violent, alteractions, with, the, dublin, police, he, was, finally, arrested, after, an, incident, a, jesuit, college, 34, before, deportation, he, was, briefly, confined, in, the, notorious, mountjoy, prison, 152, according, to, irish, government, papers, he, was, deported, as, a, destitute, and, undesirable, alien, on, his, return, voyage, artaud, believed, he, was, being, attacked, by, two, of, the, ship, s, crew, members, he, retaliated, and, was, put, in, a, straitjacket, upon, his, return, to, france, he, was, involuntarily, retained, by, the, police, and, transferred, to, a, psychiatric, hospital, 34, artaud, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, moving, between, different, institutions, depending, on, his, condition, and, world, circumstances, in, 1943, when, france, was, occupied, by, the, germans, and, italians, robert, desnos, arranged, to, have, artaud, transferred, to, the, psychiatric, hospital, in, rodez, which, was, well, inside, vichy, territory, there, he, was, put, under, the, charge, of, dr, gaston, ferdi, re, at, rodez, artaud, underwent, treatments, including, electroshock, and, art, therapy, 194, the, doctor, believed, that, artaud, s, habits, of, crafting, magic, spells, creating, astrology, charts, and, drawing, disturbing, images, were, symptoms, of, mental, illness, artaud, denounced, the, electroshock, treatments, and, consistently, pleaded, to, have, them, suspended, while, also, ascribing, to, them, the, benefit, of, having, returned, him, to, his, name, and, to, his, self, mastery, 196, scholar, alexandra, lukes, points, out, that, the, recovery, of, his, name, might, have, been, a, gesture, to, appease, his, doctors, conception, of, what, constitutes, health, 196, it, was, during, this, time, that, artaud, began, writing, and, drawing, again, after, a, long, dormant, period, in, 1946, ferdi, re, released, artaud, to, his, friends, who, placed, him, in, the, psychiatric, clinic, at, ivry, sur, seine, at, ivry, sur, seine, artaud, s, friends, encouraged, him, to, write, he, visited, a, vincent, van, gogh, exhibition, at, the, orangerie, in, paris, and, wrote, the, study, van, gogh, le, suicid, de, la, soci, t, in, 1947, the, french, magazine, k, published, it, 8, in, 1949, the, essay, was, the, first, of, artaud, s, to, be, translated, in, a, united, states, based, publication, the, influential, literary, magazine, tiger, s, eye, 8, this, rekindled, interest, in, his, work, he, recorded, pour, en, finir, avec, le, jugement, de, dieu, to, have, done, with, the, judgment, of, god, on, 22, 29, november, 1947, the, work, remained, true, to, his, vision, for, the, theatre, of, cruelty, using, screams, rants, and, vocal, shudders, to, forward, his, vision, 1, wladimir, porch, the, director, of, french, radio, shelved, the, work, the, day, before, its, scheduled, airing, on, 2, february, 1948, 62, this, was, partly, for, its, scatological, anti, american, and, anti, religious, references, and, pronouncements, but, also, because, of, its, general, randomness, with, a, cacophony, of, xylophonic, sounds, mixed, with, various, percussion, elements, as, well, as, cries, screams, grunts, onomatopoeia, and, glossolalia, as, a, result, fernand, pouey, the, director, of, dramatic, and, literary, broadcasts, for, french, radio, assembled, a, panel, to, consider, the, broadcast,
