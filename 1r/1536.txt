some, name, him, behz, d, n, son, of, vend, d, hormoz, and, others, relate, him, to, the, abbasids, or, to, the, alids, these, suggestions, are, all, doubtful, he, was, most, likely, of, persian, origin, and, was, born, in, either, merv, or, near, isfahan, the, exact, date, is, unknown, either, in, 718, 9, or, sometime, in, 723, 7, he, grew, up, in, kufa, where, he, served, as, a, slave, and, saddler, of, the, banu, ijl, clan, it, was, there, that, abu, muslim, came, into, contact, with, shia, muslims, kufa, at, the, time, was, a, hotbed, of, social, and, political, unrest, against, the, ruling, umayyad, dynasty, whose, policies, favoured, arabs, over, non, arab, converts, to, islam, maw, l, and, were, thus, perceived, to, violate, the, islamic, promises, of, equality, the, luxurious, lifestyles, of, the, umayyad, caliphs, and, their, persecution, of, the, alids, further, alienated, the, pious, this, rallied, support, for, the, shi, a, cause, of, rule, by, a, member, of, the, family, of, muhammad, who, would, as, a, god, guided, im, m, or, mahd, rule, according, to, the, quran, and, the, sunnah, and, create, a, truly, islamic, government, that, would, bring, justice, and, peace, to, the, muslim, community, by, 737, he, is, recorded, among, the, followers, of, the, gh, l, extremist, heterodox, al, mughira, these, activities, landed, him, in, prison, from, where, he, was, liberated, in, 741, 2, by, the, leading, abbasid, missionaries, naq, b, sing, naq, b, on, their, way, to, mecca, he, was, introduced, to, the, head, of, the, abbasid, clan, muhammad, ibn, ali, ibn, abdallah, who, in, 745, 6, sent, him, to, direct, the, missionary, effort, in, khurasan, khurasan, and, the, iranian, eastern, half, of, the, caliphate, in, general, offered, fertile, ground, for, the, abbasids, missionary, activities, far, from, the, umayyad, metropolitan, province, of, syria, khurasan, had, a, distinct, identity, it, was, home, to, a, large, arab, settler, community, which, in, turn, had, resulted, in, a, large, number, of, native, converts, as, well, as, intermarriage, between, arabs, and, iranians, as, a, frontier, province, exposed, to, constant, warfare, the, local, muslims, were, militarily, experienced, and, the, common, struggle, had, helped, further, unify, the, arab, and, native, muslims, of, khurasan, with, a, common, dislike, towards, the, centralizing, tendencies, of, damascus, and, the, exactions, of, the, syrian, governors, according, to, later, accounts, already, in, 718, 9, the, abbasids, had, dispatched, twelve, naq, b, into, the, province, but, modern, scholars, are, sceptical, of, such, claims, and, it, appears, that, only, after, the, failure, of, the, revolt, of, zayd, ibn, ali, in, 740, did, the, abbasid, missionary, movement, begin, to, make, headway, in, khurasan, in, 745, the, khurasani, qahtaba, ibn, shabib, al, ta, i, travelled, west, to, swear, allegiance, to, ibrahim, ibn, muhammad, and, it, was, with, him, that, abu, muslim, was, sent, east, to, assume, control, when, abu, muslim, arrived, in, khurasan, the, province, was, in, turmoil, due, to, the, impact, of, the, ongoing, umayyad, civil, war, of, the, third, fitna, which, had, re, ignited, the, feud, between, the, yaman, and, qays, tribal, groups, the, numerous, yamani, element, in, the, province, opposed, the, longtime, governor, nasr, ibn, sayyar, and, sought, to, replace, him, with, their, champion, juday, al, kirmani, al, kirmani, led, an, uprising, against, ibn, sayyar, and, drove, him, from, the, provincial, capital, merv, in, late, 746, with, the, governor, fleeing, to, the, qaysi, stronghold, of, nishapur, he, took, merv, in, december, 747, or, january, 748, defeating, the, umayyad, governor, nasr, ibn, sayyar, as, well, as, shayban, al, khariji, a, kharijite, aspirant, to, the, caliphate, he, became, the, de, facto, governor, of, khurasan, and, gained, fame, as, a, general, in, the, late, 740s, in, defeating, the, rebellion, of, bihafarid, the, leader, of, a, syncretic, persian, sect, that, was, mazdaist, abu, muslim, received, support, in, suppressing, the, rebellion, both, from, purist, muslims, and, zoroastrians, after, the, establishment, of, the, abbasid, regime, abu, muslim, remained, in, khurasan, as, its, governor, in, this, role, he, suppressed, the, shi, a, uprising, of, sharik, ibn, shaikh, al, mahri, in, bukhara, in, 750, 1, and, furthered, the, muslim, conquest, of, central, asia, sending, abu, da, ud, khalid, ibn, ibrahim, to, campaign, in, the, east, his, heroic, role, in, the, revolution, and, military, skill, along, with, his, conciliatory, politics, toward, shia, sunnis, zoroastrians, jews, and, christians, made, him, extremely, popular, among, the, people, although, it, appears, that, abu, al, abbas, al, saffah, trusted, him, in, general, he, was, wary, of, his, power, limiting, his, entourage, to, 500, men, upon, his, arrival, to, iraq, on, his, way, to, hajj, in, 754, abu, al, abbas, s, brother, al, mansur, r, 754, 775, advised, al, saffah, on, more, than, one, occasion, to, have, abu, muslim, killed, fearing, his, rising, influence, and, popularity, it, seems, that, this, dislike, was, mutual, with, abu, muslim, aspiring, to, more, power, and, looking, down, in, disdain, on, al, mansur, feeling, al, mansur, owed, abu, muslim, for, his, position, when, the, new, caliph, s, uncle, abdullah, ibn, ali, rebelled, abu, muslim, was, requested, by, al, mansur, to, crush, this, rebellion, which, he, did, and, abdullah, was, given, to, his, nephew, as, a, prisoner, abdullah, was, ultimately, executed, relations, deteriorated, quickly, when, al, mansur, sent, his, chamberlain, abu, al, khasib, to, inventory, the, spoils, of, war, and, then, appointed, abu, muslim, governor, of, syria, and, egypt, outside, his, powerbase, after, an, increasingly, acrimonious, correspondence, between, abu, muslim, and, al, mansur, abu, muslim, feared, he, was, going, to, be, killed, if, he, appeared, in, the, presence, of, the, caliph, he, later, changed, his, mind, and, decided, to, appear, in, his, presence, due, to, a, combination, of, perceived, disobedience, al, mansur, s, promise, to, keep, him, as, governor, of, khurasan, and, the, assurances, of, some, of, his, close, aides, some, of, whom, were, bribed, by, al, mansur, he, went, to, iraq, to, meet, al, mansur, in, al, mada, in, in, 755, al, mansur, proceeded, to, enumerate, his, grievances, against, abu, muslim, who, kept, reminding, the, caliph, of, his, efforts, to, enthrone, him, against, abu, muslim, were, also, charges, of, being, a, zindiq, or, heretic, al, mansur, then, signaled, five, of, his, guards, behind, a, portico, to, kill, him, abu, muslim, s, mutilated, body, was, thrown, in, the, river, tigris, and, his, commanders, were, bribed, to, acquiesce, to, the, murder, abu, muslim, s, eventual, downfall, and, execution, on, charges, of, heresy, have, contributed, to, doubts, cast, on, the, sincerity, of, his, islamic, faith, in, particular, this, includes, his, close, relationship, with, the, mobad, sunpadh, and, his, repeated, praise, of, zoroastrianism, following, his, successful, campaign, in, gorgan, there, is, a, report, of, a, tribesman, being, able, to, bypass, abu, muslim, s, line, and, relay, news, of, the, umayyad, s, destruction, by, shaving, his, beard, donning, a, kushti, and, pretending, to, be, a, zoroastrian, tassabbaha, bi, l, majus, which, suggests, his, ranks, were, of, zoroastrian, origin, furthermore, there, are, records, indicating, that, abu, muslim, planned, to, execute, all, arabic, speakers, in, khorasan, in, the, siyasatnameh, al, mulk, emphasized, that, abu, muslim, had, a, talent, for, appealing, to, zoroastrian, revivalism, whenever, he, was, alone, with, zoroastrians, he, would, say, according, to, one, of, the, books, of, the, sasanians, which, i, have, found, the, arab, empire, is, finished, i, shall, not, tum, back, until, i, have, destroyed, the, kaba, for, this, has, been, substituted, for, the, sun, we, shall, make, the, sun, our, qibla, as, it, was, in, olden, time, despite, his, assistance, in, crushing, behafarid, s, heresy, and, the, possibility, of, his, own, zoroastrian, sympathies, abu, muslim, has, not, been, remembered, favourably, by, the, zoroastrian, orthodoxy, in, the, middle, persian, tradition, as, both, the, zand, i, wahman, yasn, and, zaratosht, nama, censure, abu, muslim, his, murder, was, not, well, received, by, the, residents, of, khurasan, and, there, was, resentment, and, rebellion, among, the, population, over, the, brutal, methods, used, by, al, mansur, he, became, a, legendary, figure, for, many, in, persia, and, several, persian, heretics, started, revolts, claiming, he, had, not, died, and, would, return, the, latter, included, his, own, propagandist, ishaq, al, turk, the, zoroastrian, cleric, sunpadh, in, nishapur, the, abu, muslimiyya, subsect, of, the, kaysanites, shia, and, al, muqanna, in, khurasan, even, babak, claimed, descent, from, him, there, are, different, variations, of, legends, about, abu, muslim, and, forms, of, his, worship, in, central, asia, iran, and, afghanistan, depending, on, particular, local, traditions, some, local, saints, are, legitimized, through, an, imaginary, connection, with, abu, muslim, at, least, three, epic, romances, were, written, about, him
