private, education, first, at, a, dame, school, and, then, at, a, school, run, by, william, giles, a, dissenter, in, chatham, this, period, came, to, an, end, in, june, 1822, when, john, dickens, was, recalled, to, navy, pay, office, headquarters, at, somerset, house, and, the, family, except, for, charles, who, stayed, behind, to, finish, his, final, term, at, school, moved, to, camden, town, in,

family, friend, at, 112, college, place, camden, town, mrs, roylance, was, a, reduced, impoverished, old, lady, long, known, to, our, family, whom, dickens, later, immortalised, with, a, few, alterations, and, embellishments, as, mrs, pipchin, in, dombey, and, son, later, he, lived, in, a, back, attic, in, the, house, of, an, agent, for, the, insolvent, court, archibald, russell, a, fat, good, natured, kind, old, gentleman, with, a, quiet, old, wife, and, lame, son, in, lant, street, in, southwark, they, provided, the, inspiration, for, the, garlands, in, the, old, curiosity, shop, on, sundays, with, his, sister, frances, free, from, her, studies, at, the, royal, academy, of, music, he, spent, the, day, at, the, marshalsea, dickens, later, used, the, prison, as, a, setting, in,

near, the, present, charing, cross, railway, station, where, he, earned, six, shillings, a, week, pasting, labels, on, pots, of, boot, blacking, the, strenuous, and, often, harsh, working, conditions, made, a, lasting, impression, on, dickens, and, later, influenced, his, fiction, and, essays, becoming, the, foundation, of, his, interest, in, the, reform, of, socio, economic, and, labour, conditions, the, rigours, of, which, he, believed, were, unfairly, borne, by, the, poor, he, later, wrote, that, he, wondered, how, i, could, have, been, so, easily, cast, away, at, such, an, age, as, he, recalled, to, john, forster, from, life, of, charles, dickens, the, blacking, warehouse, was, the, last, house, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, way, at, old, hungerford, stairs, it, was, a, crazy, tumble, down, old, house, abutting, of, course, on, the, river, and, literally, overrun, with, rats, its, wainscoted, rooms, and, its, rotten, floors, and, staircase, and, the, old, grey, rats, swarming, down, in, the, cellars, and, the, sound, of, their, squeaking, and, scuffling, coming, up, the, stairs, at, all, times, and, the, dirt, and, decay, of, the, place, rise, up, visibly, before, me, as, if, i, were, there, again, the, counting, house, was, on, the, first, floor, looking, over, the, coal, barges, and, the, river, there, was, a, recess, in, it, in, which, i, was, to, sit, and, work, my, work, was, to, cover, the, pots, of, paste, blacking, first, with, a, piece, of, oil, paper, and, then, with, a, piece, of, blue, paper, to, tie, them, round, with, a, string, and, then, to, clip, the, paper, close, and, neat, all, round, until, it, looked, as, smart, as, a, pot, of, ointment, from, an, apothecary, s, shop, when, a, certain, number, of, grosses, of, pots, had, attained, this, pitch, of, perfection, i, was, to, paste, on, each, a, printed, label, and, then, go, on, again, with, more, pots, two, or, three, other, boys, were, kept, at, similar, duty, down, stairs, on, similar, wages, one, of, them, came, up, in, a, ragged, apron, and, a, paper, cap, on, the, first, monday, morning, to, show, me, the, trick, of, using, the, string, and, tying, the, knot, his, name, was, bob, fagin, and, i, took, the, liberty, of, using, his, name, long, afterwards, in, oliver, twist, when, the, warehouse, was, moved, to, chandos, street, in, the, smart, busy, district, of, covent, garden, the, boys, worked, in, a, room, in, which, the, window, gave, onto, the, street, small, audiences, gathered, and, watched, them, at, work, in, dickens, s, biographer, simon, callow, s, estimation, the, public, display, was, a, new, refinement, added, to, his, misery, a, few, months, after, his, imprisonment, john, dickens, s, mother, elizabeth, dickens, died, and, bequeathed, him, 450, on, the, expectation, of, this, legacy, dickens, was, released, from, prison, under, the, insolvent, debtors, act, dickens, arranged, for, payment, of, his, creditors, and, he, and, his, family, left, the, marshalsea, for, the, home, of, mrs, roylance, charles, s, mother, elizabeth, dickens, did, not, immediately, support, his, removal, from, the, boot, blacking, warehouse, this, influenced, dickens, s, view, that, a, father, should, rule, the, family, and, a, mother, find, her, proper, sphere, inside, the, home, i, never, afterwards, forgot, i, never, shall, forget, i, never, can, forget, that, my, mother, was, warm, for, my, being, sent, back, his, mother, s, failure, to, request, his, return, was, a, factor, in, his, dissatisfied, attitude, towards, women, righteous, indignation, stemming, from, his, own, situation, and, the, conditions, under, which, working, class, people, lived, became, major, themes, of, his, works, and, it, was, this, unhappy, period, in, his, youth, to, which, he, alluded, in, his, favourite, and, most, autobiographical, novel, david, copperfield, i, had, no, advice, no, counsel, no, encouragement, no, consolation, no, assistance, no, support, of, any, kind, from, anyone, that, i, can, call, to, mind, as, i, hope, to, go, to, heaven, dickens, was, eventually, sent, to, the, wellington, house, academy, in, camden, town, where, he, remained, until, march, 1827, having, spent, about, two, years, there, he, did, not, consider, it, to, be, a, good, school, much, of, the, haphazard, desultory, teaching, poor, discipline, punctuated, by, the, headmaster, s, sadistic, brutality, the, seedy, ushers, and, general, run, down, atmosphere, are, embodied, in, mr, creakle, s, establishment, in, david, copperfield, dickens, worked, at, the, law, office, of, ellis, and, blackmore, attorneys, of, holborn, court, gray, s, inn, as, a, junior, clerk, from, may, 1827, to, november, 1828, he, was, a, gifted, mimic, and, impersonated, those, around, him, clients, lawyers, and, clerks, captivated, with, london, s, theatre, scene, he, went, to, theatres, obsessively, he, claimed, that, for, at, least, three, years, he, went, to, the, theatre, every, day, his, favourite, actor, was, charles, mathews, and, dickens, learnt, his, monopolylogues, farces, in, which, mathews, played, every, character, by, heart, then, having, learned, gurney, s, system, of, shorthand, in, his, spare, time, he, left, to, become, a, freelance, reporter, a, distant, relative, thomas, charlton, was, a, freelance, reporter, at, doctors, commons, and, dickens, was, able, to, share, his, box, there, to, report, the, legal, proceedings, for, nearly, four, years, in, 1830, dickens, met, his, first, love, maria, beadnell, thought, to, have, been, the, model, for, the, character, dora, in, david, copperfield, maria, s, parents, disapproved, of, the, courtship, and, ended, the, relationship, by, sending, her, to, school, in, paris, in, 1832, at, the, age, of, 20, dickens, was, energetic, and, increasingly, self, confident, he, enjoyed, mimicry, and, popular, entertainment, lacked, a, clear, specific, sense, of, what, he, wanted, to, become, and, yet, knew, he, wanted, fame, drawn, to, the, theatre, he, became, an, early, member, of, the, garrick, club, he, landed, an, acting, audition, at, covent, garden, where, the, manager, george, bartley, and, the, actor, charles, kemble, were, to, see, him, dickens, prepared, meticulously, and, decided, to, imitate, the, comedian, charles, mathews, but, ultimately, he, missed, the, audition, because, of, a, cold, before, another, opportunity, arose, he, had, set, out, on, his, career, as, a, writer, in, 1833, dickens, submitted, his, first, story, a, dinner, at, poplar, walk, to, the, london, periodical, monthly, magazine, his, uncle, william, barrow, offered, him, a, job, on, the, mirror, of, parliament, and, he, worked, in, the, house, of, commons, for, the, first, time, early, in, 1832, he, rented, rooms, at, furnival, s, inn, and, worked, as, a, political, journalist, reporting, on, parliamentary, debates, and, he, travelled, across, britain, to, cover, election, campaigns, for, the, morning, chronicle, his, journalism, in, the, form, of, sketches, in, periodicals, formed, his, first, collection, of, pieces, published, in, 1836, sketches, by, boz, boz, being, a, family, nickname, he, employed, as, a, pseudonym, for, some, years, dickens, apparently, adopted, it, from, the, nickname, moses, which, he, had, given, to, his, youngest, brother, augustus, dickens, after, a, character, in, oliver, goldsmith, s, the, vicar, of, wakefield, when, pronounced, by, anyone, with, a, head, cold, moses, became, boses, later, shortened, to, boz, dickens, s, own, name, was, considered, queer, by, a, contemporary, critic, who, wrote, in, 1849, mr, dickens, as, if, in, revenge, for, his, own, queer, name, does, bestow, still, queerer, ones, upon, his, fictitious, creations, dickens, contributed, to, and, edited, journals, throughout, his, literary, career, in, january, 1835, the, morning, chronicle, launched, an, evening, edition, under, the, editorship, of, the, chronicle, s, music, critic, george, hogarth, hogarth, invited, him, to, contribute, street, sketches, and, dickens, became, a, regular, visitor, to, his, fulham, house, excited, by, hogarth, s, friendship, with, walter, scott, whom, dickens, greatly, admired, and, enjoying, the, company, of, hogarth, s, three, daughters, georgina, mary, and, 19, year, old, catherine, dickens, made, rapid, progress, both, professionally, and, socially, he, began, a, friendship, with, william, harrison, ainsworth, the, author, of, the, highwayman, novel, rookwood, 1834, whose, bachelor, salon, in, harrow, road, had, become, the, meeting, place, for, a, set, that, included, daniel, maclise, benjamin, disraeli, edward, bulwer, lytton, and, george, cruikshank, all, these, became, his, friends, and, collaborators, with, the, exception, of, disraeli, and, he, met, his, first, publisher, john, macrone, at, the, house, the, success, of, sketches, by, boz, led, to, a, proposal, from, publishers, chapman, and, hall, for, dickens, to, supply, text, to, match, robert, seymour, s, engraved, illustrations, in, a, monthly, letterpress, seymour, committed, suicide, after, the, second, instalment, and, dickens, who, wanted, to, write, a, connected, series, of, sketches, hired, phiz, to, provide, the, engravings, which, were, reduced, from, four, to, two, per, instalment, for, the, story, the, resulting, story, became, the, pickwick, papers, and, although, the, first, few, episodes, were, not, successful, the, introduction, of, the, cockney, character, sam, weller, in, the, fourth, episode, the, first, to, be, illustrated, by, phiz, marked, a, sharp, climb, in, its, popularity, the, final, instalment, sold, 40, 000, copies, on, the, impact, of, the, character, the, paris, review, stated, arguably, the, most, historic, bump, in, english, publishing, is, the, sam, weller, bump, a, publishing, phenomenon, john, sutherland, called, the, pickwick, papers, he, most, important, single, novel, of, the, victorian, era, the, unprecedented, success, led, to, numerous, spin, offs, and, merchandise, including, pickwick, cigars, playing, cards, china, figurines, sam, weller, puzzles, weller, boot, polish, and, joke, books, the, sam, weller, bump, testifies, not, merely, to, dickens, s, comic, genius, but, to, his, acumen, as, an, authorpreneur, a, portmanteau, he, inhabited, long, before, the, economist, took, it, up, for, a, writer, who, made, his, reputation, crusading, against, the, squalor, of, the, industrial, revolution, dickens, was, a, creature, of, capitalism, he, used, everything, from, the, powerful, new, printing, presses, to, the, enhanced, advertising, revenues, to, the, expansion, of, railroads, to, sell, more, books, dickens, ensured, that, his, books, were, available, in, cheap, bindings, for, the, lower, orders, as, well, as, in, morocco, and, gilt, for, people, of, quality, his, ideal, readership, included, everyone, from, the, pickpockets, who, read, oliver, twist, to, queen, victoria, who, found, it, exceedingly, interesting, on, its, impact, on, mass, culture, nicholas, dames, in, the, atlantic, writes, literature, is, not, a, big, enough, category, for, pickwick, it, defined, its, own, a, new, one, that, we, have, learned, to, call, entertainment, in, november, 1836, dickens, accepted, the, position, of, editor, of, bentley, s, miscellany, a, position, he, held, for, three, years, until, he, fell, out, with, the, owner, in, 1836, as, he, finished, the, last, instalments, of, the, pickwick, papers, he, began, writing, the, beginning, instalments, of, oliver, twist, writing, as, many, as, 90, pages, a, month, while, continuing, work, on, bentley, s, and, also, writing, four, plays, the, production, of, which, he, oversaw, oliver, twist, published, in, 1838, became, one, of, dickens, s, better, known, stories, and, was, the, first, victorian, novel, with, a, child, protagonist, on, 2, april, 1836, after, a,

with, them, dickens, became, very, attached, to, mary, and, she, died, in, his, arms, after, a, brief, illness, in, 1837, unusually, for, dickens, as, a, consequence, of, his, shock, he, stopped, working, and, he, and, catherine, stayed, at, a, little, farm, on, hampstead, heath, for, a, fortnight, dickens, idealised, mary, the, character, he, fashioned, after, her, rose, maylie, he, found, he, could, not, now, kill, as, he, had, planned, in, his, fiction, and, according, to, ackroyd, he, drew, on, memories, of, her, for, his, later, descriptions, of, little, nell, and, florence, dombey, his, grief, was, so, great, that, he, was, unable, to, meet, the, deadline, for, the, june, instalment, of, the, pickwick, papers, and, had, to, cancel, the, oliver, twist, instalment, that, month, as, well, the, time, in, hampstead, was, the, occasion, for, a, growing, bond, between, dickens, and, john, forster, to, develop, forster, soon, became, his, unofficial, business, manager, and, the, first, to, read, his, work, his, success, as, a, novelist, continued, the, young, queen, victoria, read, both, oliver, twist, and, the, pickwick, papers, staying, up, until, midnight, to, discuss,

humphrey, s, clock, series, 1840, 41, were, all, published, in, monthly, instalments, before, being, made, into, books, in, the, midst, of, all, his, activity, during, this, period, there, was, discontent, with, his, publishers, and, john, macrone, was, bought, off, while, richard, bentley, signed, over, all, his, rights, in, oliver, twist, other, signs, of, a, certain, restlessness, and, discontent, emerged, in, broadstairs, he, flirted, with, eleanor, picken, the, young, fianc, e, of, his, solicitor, s, best, friend, and, one, night, grabbed, her, and, ran, with, her, down, to, the, sea, he, declared, they, were, both, to, drown, there, in, the, sad, sea, waves, she, finally, got, free, and, afterwards, kept, her, distance, in, june, 1841, he, precipitously, set, out, on, a, two, month, tour, of, scotland, and, then, in, september, 1841, telegraphed, forster, that, he, had, decided, to, go, to, america, master, humphrey, s, clock, was, shut, down, though, dickens, was, still, keen, on, the, idea, of, the, weekly, magazine, a, form, he, liked, an, appreciation, that, had, begun, with, his, childhood, reading, of, the, 18th, century, magazines, tatler, and, the, spectator, dickens, was, perturbed, by, the, return, to, power, of, the, tories, whom, he, described, as, people, whom, politically, i, despise, and, abhor, he, had, been, tempted, to, stand, for, the, liberals, in, reading, but, decided, against, it, due, to, financial, straits, he, wrote, three, anti, tory, verse, satires, the, fine, old, english, gentleman, the, quack, doctor, s, proclamation, and, subjects, for, painters, which, were, published, in, the, examiner, on, 22, january, 1842, dickens, and, his, wife, arrived, in, boston, massachusetts, aboard, the, rms, britannia, during, their, first, trip, to, the, united, states, and, canada, at, this, time, georgina, hogarth, another, sister, of, catherine, joined, the, dickens, household, now, living, at, devonshire, terrace, marylebone, to, care, for, the, young, family, they, had, left, behind, she, remained, with, them, as, housekeeper, organiser, adviser, and, friend, until, dickens, s, death, in, 1870, dickens, modelled, the, character, of, agnes, wickfield, after, georgina, and, mary, he, described, his, impressions, in, a, travelogue, american, notes, for, general, circulation, in, notes, dickens, includes, a, powerful, condemnation, of, slavery, which, he, had, attacked, as, early, as, the, pickwick, papers, correlating, the, emancipation, of, the, poor, in, england, with, the, abolition, of, slavery, abroad, citing, newspaper, accounts, of, runaway, slaves, disfigured, by, their, masters, in, spite, of, the, abolitionist, sentiments, gleaned, from, his, trip, to, america, some, modern, commentators, have, pointed, out, inconsistencies, in, dickens, s, views, on, racial, inequality, for, instance, he, has, been, criticised, for, his, subsequent, acquiescence, in, governor, eyre, s, harsh, crackdown, during, the, 1860s, morant, bay, rebellion, in, jamaica, and, his, failure, to, join, other, british, progressives, in, condemning, it, from, richmond, virginia, dickens, returned, to, washington, d, c, and, started, a, trek, westward, with, brief, pauses, in, cincinnati, and, louisville, to, st, louis, missouri, while, there, he, expressed, a, desire, to, see, an, american, prairie, before, returning, east, a, group, of, 13, men, then, set, out, with, dickens, to, visit, looking, glass, prairie, a, trip, 30, miles, into, illinois, during, his, american, visit, dickens, spent, a, month, in, new, york, city, giving, lectures, raising, the, question, of, international, copyright, laws, and, the, pirating, of, his, work, in, america, he, persuaded, a, group, of, 25, writers, headed, by, washington, irving, to, sign, a, petition, for, him, to, take, to, congress, but, the, press, were, generally, hostile, to, this, saying, that, he, should, be, grateful, for, his, popularity, and, that, it, was, mercenary, to, complain, about, his, work, being, pirated, the, popularity, he, gained, caused, a, shift, in, his, self, perception, according, to, critic, kate, flint, who, writes, that, he, found, himself, a, cultural, commodity, and, its, circulation, had, passed, out, his, control, causing, him, to, become, interested, in, and, delve, into, themes, of, public, and, personal, personas, in, the, next, novels, she, writes, that, he, assumed, a, role, of, influential, commentator, publicly, and, in, his, fiction, evident, in, his, next, few, books, his, trip, to, the, u, s, ended, with, a, trip, to, canada, niagara, falls, toronto, kingston, and, montreal, where, he, appeared, on, stage, in, light, comedies, soon, after, his, return, to, england, dickens, began, work, on, the, first, of, his, christmas, stories, a, christmas, carol, written, in, 1843, which, was, followed, by, the, chimes, in, 1844, and, the, cricket, on, the, hearth, in, 1845, of, these, a, christmas, carol, was, most, popular, and, tapping, into, an, old, tradition, did, much, to, promote, a, renewed, enthusiasm, for, the, joys, of, christmas, in, britain, and, america, the, seeds, for, the, story, became, planted, in, dickens, s, mind, during, a, trip, to, manchester, to, witness, the, conditions, of, the, manufacturing, workers, there, this, along, with, scenes, he, had, recently, witnessed, at, the, field, lane, ragged, school, caused, dickens, to, resolve, to, strike, a, sledge, hammer, blow, for, the, poor, as, the, idea, for, the, story, took, shape, and, the, writing, began, in, earnest, dickens, became, engrossed, in, the, book, he, later, wrote, that, as, the, tale, unfolded, he, wept, and, laughed, and, wept, again, as, he, walked, about, the, black, streets, of, london, fifteen, or, twenty, miles, many, a, night, when, all, sober, folks, had, gone, to, bed, after, living, briefly, in, italy, 1844, dickens, travelled, to, switzerland, 1846, where, he, began, work, on, dombey, and, son, 1846, 48, this, and, david, copperfield, 1849, 50, mark, a, significant, artistic, break, in, dickens, s, career, as, his, novels, became, more, serious, in, theme, and, more, carefully, planned, than, his, early, works, at, about, this, time, he, was, made, aware, of, a, large, embezzlement, at, the, firm, where, his, brother, augustus, worked, john, chapman, co, it, had, been, carried, out, by, thomas, powell, a, clerk, who, was, on, friendly, terms, with, dickens, and, who, had, acted, as, mentor, to, augustus, when, he, started, work, powell, was, also, an, author, and, poet, and, knew, many, of, the, famous, writers, of, the, day, after, further, fraudulent, activities, powell, fled, to, new, york, and, published, a, book, called, the, living, authors, of, england, with, a, chapter, on, charles, dickens, who, was, not, amused, by, what, powell, had, written, one, item, that, seemed, to, have, annoyed, him, was, the, assertion, that, he, had, based, the, character, of, paul, dombey, dombey, and, son, on, thomas, chapman, one, of, the, principal, partners, at, john, chapman, co, dickens, immediately, sent, a, letter, to, lewis, gaylord, clark, editor, of, the, new, york, literary, magazine, the, knickerbocker, saying, that, powell, was, a, forger, and, thief, clark, published, the, letter, in, the, new, york, tribune, and, several, other, papers, picked, up, on, the, story, powell, began, proceedings, to, sue, these, publications, and, clark, was, arrested, dickens, realising, that, he, had, acted, in, haste, contacted, john, chapman, co, to, seek, written, confirmation, of, powell, s, guilt, dickens, did, receive, a, reply, confirming, powell, s, embezzlement, but, once, the, directors, realised, this, information, might, have, to, be, produced, in, court, they, refused, to, make, further, disclosures, owing, to, the, difficulties, of, providing, evidence, in, america, to, support, his, accusations, dickens, eventually, made, a, private, settlement, with, powell, out, of, court, angela, burdett, coutts, heir, to, the, coutts, banking, fortune, approached, dickens, in, may, 1846, about, setting, up, a, home, for, the, redemption, of, fallen, women, of, the, working, class, coutts, envisioned, a, home, that, would, replace, the, punitive, regimes, of, existing, institutions, with, a, reformative, environment, conducive, to, education, and, proficiency, in, domestic, household, chores, after, initially, resisting, dickens, eventually, founded, the, home, named, urania, cottage, in, the, lime, grove, area, of, shepherd, s, bush, which, he, managed, for, ten, years, setting, the, house, rules, reviewing, the, accounts, and, interviewing, prospective, residents, emigration, and, marriage, were, central, to, dickens, s, agenda, for, the, women, on, leaving, urania, cottage, from, which, it, is, estimated, that, about, 100, women, graduated, between, 1847, and, 1859, as, a, young, man, dickens, expressed, a, distaste, for, certain, aspects, of, organised, religion, in, 1836, in, a, pamphlet, titled, sunday, under, three, heads, he, defended, the, people, s, right, to, pleasure, opposing, a, plan, to, prohibit, games, on, sundays, look, into, your, churches, diminished, congregations, and, scanty, attendance, people, have, grown, sullen, and, obstinate, and, are, becoming, disgusted, with, the, faith, which, condemns, them, to, such, a, day, as, this, once, in, every, seven, they, display, their, feeling, by, staying, away, turn, into, the, streets, and, mark, the, rigid, gloom, that, reigns, over, everything, around, dickens, honoured, the, figure, of, jesus, christ, he, is, regarded, as, a, professing, christian, his, son, henry, fielding, dickens, described, him, as, someone, who, possessed, deep, religious, convictions, in, the, early, 1840s, he, had, shown, an, interest, in, unitarian, christianity, and, robert, browning, remarked, that, mr, dickens, is, an, enlightened, unitarian, professor, gary, colledge, has, written, that, he, never, strayed, from, his, attachment, to, popular, lay, anglicanism, dickens, authored, a, work, called, the, life, of, our, lord, 1846, a, book, about, the, life, of, christ, written, with, the, purpose, of, sharing, his, faith, with, his, children, and, family, in, a, scene, from, david, copperfield, dickens, echoed, geoffrey, chaucer, s, use, of, luke, 23, 34, from, troilus, and, criseyde, dickens, held, a, copy, in, his, library, with, g, k, chesterton, writing, among, the, great, canonical, english, authors, chaucer, and, dickens, have, the, most, in, common, dickens, disapproved, of, roman, catholicism, and, 19th, century, evangelicalism, seeing, both, as, extremes, of, christianity, and, likely, to, limit, personal, expression, and, was, critical, of, what, he, saw, as, the, hypocrisy, of, religious, institutions, and, philosophies, like, spiritualism, all, of, which, he, considered, deviations, from, the, true, spirit, of, christianity, as, shown, in, the, book, he, wrote, for, his, family, in, 1846, while, dickens, advocated, equal, rights, for, catholics, in, england, he, strongly, disliked, how, individual, civil, liberties, were, often, threatened, in, countries, where, catholicism, predominated, and, referred, to, the, catholic, church, as, that, curse, upon, the, world, dickens, also, rejected, the, evangelical, conviction, that, the, bible, was, the, infallible, word, of, god, his, ideas, on, biblical, interpretation, were, similar, to, the, liberal, anglican, arthur, penrhyn, stanley, s, doctrine, of, progressive, revelation, leo, tolstoy, and, fyodor, dostoyevsky, referred, to, dickens, as, that, great, christian, writer, in, december, 1845, dickens, took, up, the, editorship, of, the, london, based, daily, news, a, liberal, paper, through, which, dickens, hoped, to, advocate, in, his, own, words, the, principles, of, progress, and, improvement, of, education, and, civil, and, religious, liberty, and, equal, legislation, among, the, other, contributors, dickens, chose, to, write, for, the, paper, were, the, radical, economist,

house, where, he, wrote, bleak, house, 1852, 53, hard, times, 1854, and, little, dorrit, 1856, it, was, here, that, he, indulged, in, the, amateur, theatricals, described, in, forster, s, life, of, charles, dickens, during, this, period, he, worked, closely, with, the, novelist, and, playwright, wilkie, collins, in, 1856, his, income, from, writing, allowed, him, to, buy, gads, hill, place, in,

s, widow, lady, jane, dickens, viciously, attacked, arctic, explorer, john, rae, in, household, words, for, his, report, to, the, admiralty, based, on, interviews, with, local, inuit, that, the, members, of, franklin, s, lost, expedition, had, resorted, to, cannibalism, these, attacks, would, later, be, expanded, on, his, 1856, play, the, frozen, deep, which, satirises, rae, and, the, inuit, twentieth, century, archaeology, work, in, king, william, island, later, confirmed, that, the, members, of, the, franklin, expedition, resorted, to, cannibalism, in, 1855, when, dickens, s, good, friend, and, liberal, mp, austen, henry, layard, formed, an, administrative, reform, association, to, demand, significant, reforms, of, parliament, dickens, joined, and, volunteered, his, resources, in, support, of, layard, s, cause, with, the, exception, of, lord, john, russell, who, was, the, only, leading, politician, in, whom, dickens, had, any, faith, and, to, whom, he, later, dedicated, a, tale, of, two, cities, dickens, believed, that, the, political, aristocracy, and, their, incompetence, were, the, death, of, england, when, he, and, layard, were, accused, of, fomenting, class, conflict, dickens, replied, that, the, classes, were, already, in, opposition, and, the, fault, was, with, the, aristocratic, class, dickens, used, his, pulpit, in, household, words, to, champion, the, reform, association, he, also, commented, on, foreign, affairs, declaring, his, support, for, giuseppe, garibaldi, and, giuseppe, mazzini, helping, raise, funds, for, their, campaigns, and, stating, that, a, united, italy, would, be, of, vast, importance, to, the, peace, of, the, world, and, would, be, a, rock, in, louis, napoleon, s, way, and, that, i, feel, for, italy, almost, as, if,

wishing, that, he, was, the, commander, in, chief, in, india, so, that, he, would, be, able, to, do, my, utmost, to, exterminate, the, race, upon, whom, the, stain, of, the, late, cruelties, rested, in, 1857, dickens, hired, professional, actresses, for, the, frozen, deep, which, he, and, his, prot, g, wilkie, collins, had, written, dickens, fell, in, love, with, one, of, the, actresses, ellen, ternan, and, this, passion, was, to, last, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1858, when, dickens, was, 45, and, ternan, 18, divorce, would, have, been, scandalous, for, someone, of, his, fame, after, publicly, accusing, catherine, of, not, loving, their, children, and, suffering, from, a, mental, disorder, statements, that, disgusted, his, contemporaries, including, elizabeth, barrett, browning,

friend, the, hospital, s, founder, charles, west, to, preside, over, the, appeal, and, he, threw, himself, into, the, task, heart, and, soul, dickens, s, public, readings, secured, sufficient, funds, for, an, endowment, to, put, the, hospital, on, a, sound, financial, footing, one, reading, on, 9, february, 1858, alone, raised, 3, 000, after, separating, from, catherine, dickens, undertook, a, series, of, popular, and, remunerative, reading, tours, which, together, with, his, journalism, were, to, absorb, most, of, his, creative, energies, for, the, next, decade, in, which, he, was, to, write, only, two, novels, his, first, reading, tour, lasting, from, april, 1858, to, february, 1859, consisted, of, 129, appearances, in, 49, towns, throughout, england, scotland, and, ireland,

on, the, ground, in, response, to, his, sister, in, law, georgina, s, request, that, he, lie, down, on, sunday, 19, june, 1870, five, days, after, dickens, was, buried, in, the, abbey, dean, arthur, penrhyn, stanley, delivered, a, memorial, elegy, lauding, the, genial, and, loving, humorist, whom, we, now, mourn, for, showing, by, his, own, example, that, even, in, dealing, with, the, darkest, scenes, and, the, most, degraded, characters, genius, could, still, be, clean, and, mirth, could, be, innocent, pointing, to, the, fresh, flowers, that, adorned, the, novelist, s, grave, stanley,

to, 967, 000, in, 2023, he, confirmed, his, wife, catherine, s, annual, allowance, of, 600, 72, 500, in, 2023, he, bequeathed, 19, 19s, 2, 400, in, 2023, to, each, servant, in, his, employment, at, the, time, of, his, death, dickens, s, approach, to, the, novel, is, influenced, by, various, things, including, the, picaresque, novel, tradition, melodrama, and, the, novel, of, sensibility, according, to, ackroyd, other, than, these, perhaps, the, most, important, literary, influence, on, him, was, derived, from, the, fables, of, the, arabian, nights, satire, and, irony, are, central, to, the, picaresque, novel, comedy, is, also, an, aspect, of, the, british, picaresque, novel, tradition, of, laurence, sterne, henry, fielding, and, tobias, smollett, fielding, s, tom, jones, was, a, major, influence, on, the, 19th, century, novelist, including, dickens, who, read, it, in, his, youth, and, named, a, son, henry, fielding, dickens, after, him, influenced, by, gothic, fiction, a, literary, genre, that, began, with, the, castle, of, otranto, 1764, by, horace, walpole, dickens, incorporated, gothic, imagery, settings, and, plot, devices, in, his, works, victorian, gothic, moved, from, castles, and, abbeys, into, contemporary, urban, environments, in, particular, london, such, as, dickens, s, oliver, twist, and, bleak, house, the, jilted, bride, miss, havisham, from, great, expectations, is, one, of, dickens, s, best, known, gothic, creations, living, in, a, ruined, mansion, her, bridal, gown, effectively, doubles, as, her, funeral, shroud, no, other, writer, had, such, a, profound, influence, on, dickens, as, william, shakespeare, on, dickens, s, veneration, of, shakespeare, alfred, harbage, wrote, in, a, kind, of, power, the, shakespeare, dickens, analogy, 1975, that, no, one, is, better, qualified, to, recognise, literary, genius, than, a, literary, genius, regarding, shakespeare, as, the, great, master, whose, plays, were, an, unspeakable, source, of, delight, dickens, s, lifelong, affinity, with, the, playwright, included, seeing, theatrical, productions, of, his, plays, in, london, and, putting, on, amateur, dramatics, with, friends, in, his, early, years, in, 1838, dickens, travelled, to, stratford, upon, avon, and, visited, the, house, in, which, shakespeare, was, born, leaving, his, autograph, in, the, visitors, book, dickens, would, draw, on, this, experience, in, his, next, work, nicholas, nickleby, 1838, 39, expressing, the, strength, of, feeling, experienced, by, visitors, to, shakespeare, s, birthplace, the, character, mrs,

up, quite, a, fire, within, one, dickens, s, writing, style, is, marked, by, a, profuse, linguistic, creativity, satire, flourishing, in, his, gift, for, caricature, is, his, forte, an, early, reviewer, compared, him, to, hogarth, for, his, keen, practical, sense, of, the, ludicrous, side, of, life, though, his, acclaimed, mastery, of, varieties, of, class, idiom, may, in, fact, mirror, the, conventions, of, contemporary, popular, theatre, dickens, worked, intensively, on, developing, arresting, names, for, his, characters, that, would, reverberate, with, associations, for, his, readers, and, assist, the, development, of, motifs, in, the, storyline, giving, what, one, critic, calls, an, allegorical, impetus, to, the, novels, meanings, to, cite, one, of, numerous, examples, the, name, mr, murdstone, in, david, copperfield, conjures, up, twin, allusions, to, murder, and, stony, coldness, his, literary, style, is, also, a, mixture, of, fantasy, and, realism, his, satires, of, british, aristocratic, snobbery, he, calls, one, character, the, noble, refrigerator, are, often, popular, comparing, orphans, to, stocks, and, shares, people, to, tug, boats, or, dinner, party, guests, to, furniture, are, just, some, of, dickens, s, acclaimed, flights, of, fancy, on, his, ability, to, elicit, a, response, from, his, works, english, screenwriter, sarah, phelps, writes, he, knew, how, to, work, an, audience, and, how, to, get, them, laughing, their, heads, off, one, minute, or, on, the, edge, of, their, seats, and, holding, their, breath, the, next, the, other, thing, about, dickens, is, that, he, loved, telling, stories, and, he, loved, his, characters, even, those, horrible, mean, spirited, ones, the, author, worked, closely, with, his, illustrators, supplying, them, with, a, summary, of, the, work, at, the, outset, and, thus, ensuring, that, his, characters, and, settings, were, exactly, how, he, envisioned, them, he, briefed, the, illustrator, on, plans,

for, debt, and, this, became, a, common, theme, in, many, of, his, books, with, the, detailed, depiction, of, life, in, the, marshalsea, prison, in, little, dorrit, resulting, from, dickens, s, own,

he, gathered, his, realistic, accounts, of, squalor, very, few, knew, the, details, of, his, early, life, until, six, years, after, his, death, when, john, forster, published, a, biography, on, which,

ignorance, about, what, poverty, entailed, at, a, time, when, britain, was, the, major, economic, and, political, power, of, the, world, dickens, highlighted, the, life, of, the, forgotten, poor, and, disadvantaged, within, society, through, his, journalism, he, campaigned, on, specific, issues, such, as, sanitation, and, the, workhouse, but, his, fiction, probably, demonstrated, its, greatest, prowess, in, changing, public, opinion, in, regard, to, class, inequalities, he, often, depicted, the, exploitation, and, oppression, of, the, poor, and, condemned, the, public, officials, and, institutions, that, not, only, allowed, such, abuses, to, exist, but, flourished, as, a, result, his, most, strident, indictment, of, this, condition, is, in, hard, times, 1854, dickens, s, only,

socially, oppositional, themes, bleak, house, 1853, little, dorrit, 1857, our, mutual, friend, 1865, not, only, underscored, his, ability, to, create, compelling, storylines, and, unforgettable, characters, but, also, ensured, that, the, victorian, public, confronted, issues, of, social, justice, that, had, commonly, been, ignored, it, has, been, argued, that, his, technique, of, flooding, his, narratives, with, an, unruly, superfluity, of, material, that, in, the, gradual, d, nouement, yields, up, an, unsuspected, order, influenced, the, organisation, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, dickens, is, often, described, as, using, idealised, characters, and, highly, sentimental, scenes, to, contrast, with, his, caricatures, and, the, ugly, social, truths, he, reveals, the, story, of, nell, trent, in, the, old, curiosity, shop, 1841, was, received, as, extremely, moving, by, contemporary, readers, but, viewed, as, ludicrously, sentimental, by, oscar, wilde,

the, death, of, little, nell, but, the, life, of, little, nell, that, i, object, to, arguing, that, the, maudlin, effect, of, his, description, of, her, life, owed, much, to, the, gregarious, nature, of, dickens, s, grief, his, despotic, use, of, people, s, feelings, to, move, them, to, tears, in, works, like, this, the, question, as, to, whether, dickens, belongs, to, the, tradition, of, the, sentimental, novel, is, debatable, valerie, purton, in, her, book, dickens, and, the, sentimental, tradition, sees, him, continuing, aspects, of, this, tradition, and, argues, that, his, sentimental, scenes, and, characters, as, crucial, to, the, overall, power, of, the, novels, as, his, darker, or, comic, figures, and, scenes, and, that, dombey, and, son, is, dickens, s, greatest, triumph, in, the, sentimentalist, tradition, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, online, comments, that, despite, patches, of, emotional, excess, such, as, the, reported, death, of, tiny, tim, in, a, christmas, carol, 1843, dickens, cannot, really, be, termed, a, sentimental, novelist, in, oliver, twist, dickens, provides, readers, with, an, idealised, portrait, of, a, boy, so, inherently, and, unrealistically, good, that, his, values, are, never, subverted, by, either, brutal, orphanages, or, coerced, involvement, in, a, gang, of, young, pickpockets, while, later, novels, also, centre, on, idealised, characters, esther, summerson, in, bleak, house, and, amy, dorrit, in, little, dorrit, this, idealism, serves, only, to, highlight, dickens, s, goal, of, poignant, social, commentary, dickens, s, fiction, reflecting, what, he, believed, to, be, true, of, his, own, life, makes, frequent, use, of, coincidence, either, for, comic, effect, or, to, emphasise, the, idea, of, providence, for, example, oliver, twist, turns, out, to, be, the, lost, nephew, of, the, upper, class, family, that, rescues, him, from, the, dangers, of, the, pickpocket, group, such, coincidences, are, a, staple, of, 18th, century, picaresque, novels, such, as, henry, fielding, s, tom, jones, which, dickens, enjoyed, reading, as, a, youth, dickens, was, the, most, popular, novelist, of, his, time, and, remains, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, read, of, english, authors, his, works, have, never, gone, out, of, print, and, have, been, adapted, continually, for, the, screen, since, the,
