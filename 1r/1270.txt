of, the, raad, van, state, the, highest, political, advisory, council, in, the, netherlands, it, was, in, november, of, the, same, year, 1555, that, the, gout, afflicted, emperor, charles, leaned, on, william, s, shoulder, during, the, ceremony, when, he, abdicated, the, low, countries, in, favour, of, his, son, philip, ii, of, spain, william, was, also, selected, to, carry, the, insignia, of, the, holy, roman, empire, to, charles, s, brother, ferdinand, when, charles, resigned, the, imperial, crown, in, 1556, and, was, one, of, the, spanish, signatories, for, the, april, 1559, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, in, 1559, philip, ii, appointed, william, stadtholder, governor, of, the, provinces, of, holland, zeeland, and, utrecht, thereby, greatly, increasing, his, political, power, a, stadtholdership, over, franche, comt, followed, in, 1561, although, he, never, directly, opposed, the, spanish, king, william, soon, became, one, of, the, most, prominent, members, of, the, opposition, in, the, council, of, state, together, with, philip, de, montmorency, count, of, hoorn, and, lamoral, count, of, egmont, they, were, mainly, seeking, more, political, power, for, themselves, against, the, de, facto, government, of, count, berlaymont, granvelle, and, viglius, of, aytta, but, also, for, the, dutch, nobility, and, ostensibly, for, the, estates, and, complained, that, too, many, spaniards, were, involved, in, governing, the, netherlands, william, was, also, dissatisfied, with, the, increasing, persecution, of, protestants, in, the, netherlands, brought, up, as, a, lutheran, and, later, a, catholic, william, was, very, religious, but, was, still, a, proponent, of, freedom, of, religion, for, all, people, the, activity, of, the, inquisition, in, the, netherlands, directed, by, cardinal, granvelle, prime, minister, to, the, new, governor, margaret, of, parma, 1522, 1583, natural, half, sister, to, philip, ii, increased, opposition, to, spanish, rule, among, the, then, mostly, catholic, population, of, the, netherlands, lastly, the, opposition, wished, to, see, an, end, to, the, presence, of, spanish, troops, according, to, the, apology, william, s, letter, of, justification, which, was, published, and, read, to, the, states, general, in, december, 1580, his, resolve, to, expel, the, spaniards, from, the, netherlands, had, originated, when, in, the, summer, of, 1559, he, and, the, duke, of, alba, had, been, sent, to, france, as, hostages, for, the, proper, fulfilment, of, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, following, the, hispano, french, war, during, his, stay, in, paris, on, a, hunting, trip, to, the, bois, de, vincennes, king, henry, ii, of, france, started, to, discuss, with, william, a, secret, understanding, between, philip, ii, and, himself, aimed, at, the, violent, extermination, of, protestantism, in, france, the, netherlands, and, the, entire, christian, world, the, understanding, was, being, negotiated, by, alba, and, henry, had, assumed, incorrectly, that, william, was, aware, of, it, at, the, time, william, did, not, contradict, the, king, s, assumption, but, he, had, decided, for, himself, that, he, would, not, allow, the, slaughter, of, so, many, honourable, people, especially, in, the, netherlands, for, which, he, felt, a, strong, compassion, on, 25, august, 1561, william, of, orange, married, for, the, second, time, his, new, wife, anna, of, saxony, was, described, by, contemporaries, as, self, absorbed, weak, assertive, and, cruel, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, william, married, her, to, gain, more, influence, in, saxony, hesse, and, the, palatinate, the, couple, had, five, children, the, marriage, used, lutheran, rites, and, marked, the, beginning, of, a, gradual, change, in, his, religious, opinions, which, was, to, lead, william, to, revert, to, lutheranism, and, eventually, moderate, calvinism, still, he, remained, tolerant, of, other, religious, opinions, up, to, this, time, william, s, life, had, been, marked, by, lavish, display, and, extravagance, he, surrounded, himself, with, a, retinue, of, young, noblemen, and, dependents, and, kept, open, house, in, his, magnificent, nassau, palace, at, brussels, consequently, the, revenue, of, his, vast, estates, was, not, sufficient, to, prevent, him, being, crippled, by, debt, but, after, his, return, from, france, a, change, began, to, come, over, william, philip, made, him, councillor, of, state, knight, of, the, golden, fleece, and, stadtholder, of, holland, zeeland, and, utrecht, but, there, was, a, latent, antagonism, between, the, natures, of, the, two, men, up, to, 1564, any, criticism, of, governmental, measures, voiced, by, william, and, the, other, members, of, the, opposition, had, ostensibly, been, directed, at, granvelle, however, after, the, latter, s, departure, early, that, year, william, who, may, have, found, increasing, confidence, in, his, alliance, with, the, protestant, princes, of, germany, following, his, second, marriage, began, to, openly, criticise, the, king, s, anti, protestant, politics, in, august, of, that, year, philip, issued, an, order, for, carrying, out, the, decrees, of, the, anti, protestant, council, of, trent, but, in, an, iconic, speech, to, the, council, of, state, william, to, the, shock, of, his, audience, justified, his, conflict, with, philip, by, saying, that, even, though, he, had, decided, for, himself, to, keep, to, the, catholic, faith, at, the, time, he, could, not, agree, that, monarchs, should, rule, over, the, souls, of, their, subjects, and, take, from, them, their, freedom, of, belief, and, religion, in, early, 1565, a, large, group, of, lesser, noblemen, including, william, s, younger, brother, louis, formed, the, confederacy, of, noblemen, on, 5, april, they, offered, a, petition, to, margaret, of, parma, requesting, an, end, to, the, persecution, of, protestants, from, august, to, october, 1566, a, wave, of, iconoclasm, known, as, the, beeldenstorm, spread, through, the, low, countries, calvinists, the, major, protestant, denomination, anabaptists, and, mennonites, angered, by, catholic, oppression, and, theologically, opposed, to, the, catholic, use, of, images, of, saints, which, in, their, eyes, conflicted, with, the, second, commandment, destroyed, statues, in, hundreds, of, churches, and, monasteries, throughout, the, netherlands, following, the, beeldenstorm, unrest, in, the, netherlands, grew, and, margaret, agreed, to, grant, the, wishes, of, the, confederacy, provided, the, noblemen, would, help, to, restore, order, she, also, allowed, more, important, noblemen, including, william, of, orange, to, assist, the, confederacy, and, william, went, to, antwerp, where, he, succeeded, in, quelling, the, riot, in, late, 1566, and, early, 1567, it, became, clear, that, she, would, not, be, allowed, to, fulfil, her, promises, and, when, several, minor, rebellions, failed, many, calvinists, and, lutherans, fled, the, country, following, the, announcement, that, philip, ii, unhappy, with, the, situation, in, the, netherlands, would, dispatch, his, loyal, general, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, or, alva, also, known, as, the, iron, duke, to, restore, order, william, laid, down, his, functions, and, retreated, to, his, native, nassau, in, april, 1567, he, had, been, financially, involved, with, several, of, the, rebellions, after, his, arrival, in, august, 1567, alba, established, the, council, of, troubles, known, to, the, people, as, the, council, of, blood, to, judge, those, involved, in, the, rebellion, and, the, iconoclasm, william, was, one, of, the, 10, 000, to, be, summoned, before, the, council, but, he, failed, to, appear, he, was, subsequently, declared, an, outlaw, and, his, properties, were, confiscated, as, one, of, the, most, prominent, and, popular, politicians, of, the, netherlands, william, of, orange, emerged, as, the, leader, of, armed, resistance, he, financed, the, watergeuzen, refugee, protestants, who, formed, bands, of, corsairs, and, raided, the, coastal, cities, of, the, netherlands, often, killing, spanish, and, dutch, alike, he, also, raised, an, army, consisting, mostly, of, german, mercenaries, to, fight, alba, on, land, william, allied, with, the, french, huguenots, following, the, end, of, the, second, religious, war, in, france, when, they, had, troops, to, spare, led, by, his, brother, louis, the, army, invaded, the, northern, netherlands, in, 1568, however, the, plan, failed, almost, from, the, start, the, huguenots, were, defeated, by, french, royal, troops, before, they, could, invade, and, a, small, force, under, jean, de, villers, was, captured, within, two, days, villers, gave, all, the, plans, of, the, campaign, to, the, spanish, following, his, capture, on, 23, may, the, army, under, the, command, of, louis, won, the, battle, of, heiligerlee, in, the, northern, province, of, groningen, against, a, spanish, army, led, by, the, stadtholder, of, the, northern, provinces, jean, de, ligne, duke, of, arenberg, arenberg, was, killed, in, the, battle, as, was, william, s, brother, adolf, alba, countered, by, killing, a, number, of, convicted, noblemen, including, the, counts, of, egmont, and, hoorn, on, 6, june, and, then, by, leading, an, expedition, to, groningen, there, he, annihilated, louis, forces, on, german, territory, in, the, battle, of, jemmingen, on, 21, july, although, louis, managed, to, escape, these, two, battles, are, now, considered, to, be, the, start, of, the, eighty, years, war, in, october, 1568, william, responded, by, leading, a, large, army, into, brabant, but, alba, carefully, avoided, a, decisive, confrontation, expecting, the, army, to, fall, apart, quickly, as, william, advanced, disorder, broke, out, in, his, army, and, with, winter, approaching, and, money, running, out, william, turned, back, and, crossed, into, france, william, made, several, more, plans, to, invade, in, the, next, few, years, but, little, came, of, them, since, he, lacked, support, and, money, he, remained, popular, with, the, public, in, part, through, an, extensive, propaganda, campaign, conducted, through, pamphlets, one, of, his, most, important, claims, with, which, he, attempted, to, justify, his, actions, was, that, he, was, not, fighting, the, rightful, ruler, of, the, land, the, king, of, spain, but, only, the, inadequate, rule, of, the, foreign, governors, in, the, netherlands, and, the, presence, of, foreign, soldiers, on, 22, august, 1571, his, second, wife, anna, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, named, christina, von, dietz, and, fathered, by, jan, rubens, best, known, as, the, father, of, painter, peter, paul, rubens, jan, rubens, had, been, sent, by, anna, s, uncle, in, 1570, to, manage, her, finances, later, that, year, william, had, this, marriage, legally, dissolved, on, the, grounds, that, anna, was, insane, on, 1, april, 1572, a, group, known, as, the, watergeuzen, sea, beggars, captured, the, city, of, brielle, which, had, been, left, unattended, by, the, spanish, garrison, contrary, to, their, normal, hit, and, run, tactics, they, occupied, the, town, and, claimed, it, for, the, prince, by, raising, the, prince, of, orange, s, flag, above, the, city, this, event, was, followed, by, other, cities, opening, their, gates, for, the, watergeuzen, and, soon, most, cities, in, holland, and, zeeland, were, in, the, hands, of, the, rebels, notable, exceptions, being, amsterdam, and, middelburg, the, rebel, cities, then, called, a, meeting, of, the, staten, generaal, which, they, were, technically, unqualified, to, do, and, reinstated, william, as, the, stadtholder, of, holland, and, zeeland, concurrently, rebel, armies, captured, cities, throughout, the, entire, country, from, deventer, to, mons, william, himself, then, advanced, with, his, own, army, and, marched, into, several, cities, in, the, south, including, roermond, and, leuven, william, had, counted, on, intervention, from, the, huguenots, as, well, but, this, plan, was, thwarted, after, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, on, 24, august, which, signalled, the, start, of, a, wave, of, violence, against, the, huguenots, after, a, successful, spanish, attack, on, his, army, william, had, to, flee, and, he, retreated, to, enkhuizen, in, holland, the, spanish, then, organised, countermeasures, and, sacked, several, rebel, cities, sometimes, massacring, their, inhabitants, such, as, in, mechelen, or, zutphen, they, had, more, trouble, with, the, cities, in, holland, where, they, took, haarlem, after, seven, months, and, a, loss, of, 8, 000, soldiers, and, they, had, to, break, off, their, siege, of, alkmaar, in, 1573, william, joined, the, calvinist, church, he, appointed, a, calvinist, theologian, jean, taffin, 1573, 1581, as, his, court, preacher, taffin, was, later, joined, by, pierre, loyseleur, de, villiers, 1577, 1584, who, also, became, an, important, political, advisor, to, the, prince, in, 1574, william, s, armies, won, several, minor, battles, including, several, naval, encounters, the, spanish, led, by, don, luis, de, z, iga, y, requesens, since, philip, replaced, alba, in, 1573, also, had, their, successes, their, decisive, victory, in, the, battle, of, mookerheyde, in, the, south, east, on, the, meuse, embankment, on, 14, april, cost, the, lives, of, two, of, william, s, brothers, louis, and, henry, requesens, s, armies, also, besieged, the, city, of, leiden, they, broke, off, their, siege, when, nearby, dykes, were, breached, by, the, dutch, william, was, content, with, the, victory, and, established, the, university, of, leiden, the, first, university, in, the, northern, provinces, william, married, for, the, third, time, on, 24, april, 1575, to, charlotte, de, bourbon, montpensier, a, former, french, nun, who, was, also, popular, with, the, public, although, less, so, with, the, catholic, faction, they, had, six, daughters, the, marriage, which, seems, to, have, been, a, love, match, on, both, sides, was, happy, after, failed, peace, negotiations, in, breda, in, 1575, the, war, continued, the, situation, improved, for, the, rebels, when, don, requesens, died, unexpectedly, in, march, 1576, and, a, large, group, of, spanish, soldiers, not, having, received, their, salary, in, months, mutinied, in, november, of, that, year, and, unleashed, the, spanish, fury, on, antwerp, sacking, the, city, in, what, became, a, tremendous, propaganda, coup, for, the, rebels, while, the, new, governor, don, juan, of, austria, was, en, route, william, of, orange, got, most, of, the, provinces, and, cities, to, sign, the, pacification, of, ghent, in, which, they, declared, themselves, ready, to, fight, for, the, expulsion, of, spanish, troops, together, however, he, failed, to, achieve, unity, in, matters, of, religion, catholic, cities, and, provinces, would, not, allow, freedom, for, calvinists, when, don, juan, signed, the, perpetual, edict, in, february, 1577, promising, to, comply, with, the, conditions, of, the, pacification, of, ghent, it, seemed, that, the, war, had, been, decided, in, favour, of, the, rebels, however, after, don, juan, took, the, city, of, namur, in, 1577, the, uprising, spread, throughout, the, entire, netherlands, don, juan, attempted, to, negotiate, peace, but, the, prince, intentionally, let, the, negotiations, fail, on, 24, september, 1577, he, made, his, triumphal, entry, into, brussels, the, capital, at, the, same, time, calvinist, rebels, grew, more, radical, and, attempted, to, forbid, catholicism, in, areas, under, their, control, william, was, opposed, to, this, both, for, personal, and, political, reasons, he, desired, freedom, of, religion, and, he, also, needed, the, support, of, the, less, radical, protestants, and, catholics, to, reach, his, political, goals, on, 6, january, 1579, several, southern, provinces, unhappy, with, william, s, radical, following, signed, the, treaty, of, arras, in, which, they, agreed, to, accept, their, catholic, governor, alessandro, farnese, duke, of, parma, who, had, succeeded, don, juan, five, northern, provinces, later, followed, by, most, cities, in, brabant, and, flanders, then, signed, the, union, of, utrecht, on, 23, january, confirming, their, unity, william, was, initially, opposed, to, the, union, as, he, still, hoped, to, unite, all, provinces, nevertheless, he, formally, gave, his, support, on, 3, may, the, union, of, utrecht, would, later, become, a, de, facto, constitution, and, would, remain, the, only, formal, connection, between, the, dutch, provinces, until, 1797, in, spite, of, the, renewed, union, the, duke, of, parma, was, successful, in, reconquering, most, of, the, southern, part, of, the, netherlands, because, he, had, agreed, to, remove, the, spanish, troops, from, the, provinces, under, the, treaty, of, arras, and, because, philip, ii, needed, them, elsewhere, subsequently, the, duke, of, parma, was, unable, to, advance, any, further, until, the, end, of, 1581, in, march, 1580, philip, issued, a, royal, ban, of, outlawry, against, the, prince, of, orange, promising, a, reward, of, 25, 000, crowns, to, any, man, who, would, succeed, in, killing, him, william, responded, with, his, apology, a, document, in, fact, written, by, villiers, in, which, his, course, of, actions, was, defended, the, person, of, the, spanish, king, viciously, attacked, and, his, own, protestant, allegiance, restated, in, the, meantime, william, and, his, supporters, were, looking, for, foreign, support, the, prince, had, already, sought, french, assistance, on, several, occasions, and, this, time, he, managed, to, gain, the, support, of, francis, duke, of, anjou, brother, of, king, henry, iii, of, france, on, 29, september, 1580, the, staten, generaal, with, the, exception, of, zeeland, and, holland, signed, the, treaty, of, plessis, les, tours, with, the, duke, of, anjou, the, duke, would, gain, the, title, protector, of, the, liberty, of, the, netherlands, and, become, the, new, sovereign, this, however, required, that, the, staten, generaal, and, william, renounce, their, formal, support, of, the, king, of, spain, which, they, had, maintained, officially, up, to, that, moment, on, 22, july, 1581, the, staten, generaal, declared, that, they, no, longer, recognised, philip, ii, of, spain, as, their, ruler, in, the, act, of, abjuration, this, formal, declaration, of, independence, enabled, the, duke, of, anjou, to, come, to, the, aid, of, the, resisters, he, did, not, arrive, until, 10, february, 1582, when, he, was, officially, welcomed, by, william, in, flushing, on, 18, march, the, spaniard, juan, de, j, uregui, attempted, to, assassinate, william, in, antwerp, although, william, suffered, severe, injuries, he, survived, thanks, to, the, care, of, his, wife, charlotte, and, his, sister, mary, while, william, slowly, recovered, charlotte, became, exhausted, from, providing, intensive, care, and, died, on, 5, may, the, duke, of, anjou, was, not, very, popular, with, the, population, the, provinces, of, zeeland, and, holland, refused, to, recognise, him, as, their, sovereign, and, william, was, widely, criticised, for, what, was, called, his, french, politics, when, anjou, s, french, troops, arrived, in, late, 1582, william, s, plan, seemed, to, pay, off, as, even, the, duke, of, parma, feared, that, the, dutch, would, now, gain, the, upper, hand, however, anjou, himself, was, displeased, with, his, limited, powers, and, secretly, decided, to, seize, antwerp, by, force, the, citizens, who, had, been, warned, in, time, ambushed, anjou, and, his, troops, as, they, entered, the, city, on, 18, january, 1583, in, what, is, known,

of, the, netherlands, is, descended, from, william, the, silent, through, the, female, line, see, house, of, orange, for, a, more, extensive, overview, as, the, chief, financer, and, political, and, military, leader, of, the, early, years, of, the, dutch, revolt, william, is, considered, a, national, hero, in, the, netherlands, even, though, he, was, born, in, germany, and, usually, spoke, french, in, the, 19th, century, the, netherlands, became, a, constitutional, monarchy, currently, with, king, willem, alexander, as, head, of, state, he, has, cognatic, descent, from, william, of, orange, all, stadtholders, after, william, of, orange, were, drawn, from, his, descendants, or, the, descendants, of, his, brother, many, of, the, dutch, national, symbols, can, be, traced, back, to, william, of, orange, other, remembrances, of, william, of, orange, there, are, several, explanations, for, the, origin, of, the, style, william, the, silent, the, most, common, one, relates, to, his, prudence, in, regard, to, a, conversation, with, henry, ii, the, king, of, france, one, day, during, a, stag, hunt, in, the, bois, de, vincennes, henry, finding, himself, alone, with, the, prince, began, to, speak, of, the, great, number, of, protestant, sectaries, who, during, the, late, war, had, increased, so, much, in, his, kingdom, to, his, great, sorrow, his, conscience, said, the, king, would, not, be, easy, nor, his, realm, secure, until, he, could, see, it, purged, of, the, accursed, vermin, who, would, one, day, overthrow, his, government, under, the, cover, of, religion, if, they, were, allowed, to, get, the, upper, hand, this, was, the, more, to, be, feared, since, some, of, the, chief, men, in, the, kingdom, and, even, some, princes, of, the, blood, were, on, their, side, but, he, hoped, by, the, grace, of, god, and, the, good, understanding, that, he, had, with, his, new, son, the, king, of, spain, that, he, would, soon, get, the, better, of, them, the, king, talked, on, thus, to, orange, in, the, full, conviction, that, he, was, aware, of, the, secret, agreement, recently, made, with, the, duke, of, alba, for, the, extirpation, of, heresy, but, the, prince, subtle, and, adroit, as, he, was, answered, the, good, king, in, such, a, way, as, to, leave, him, still, under, the, impression, that, he, the, prince, knew, all, about, the, scheme, proposed, by, alba, and, on, this, understanding, the, king, revealed, all, the, details, of, the, plan, which, had, been, arranged, between, the, king, of, spain, and, himself, for, the, rooting, out, and, rigorous, punishment, of, the, heretics, from, the, lowest, to, the, highest, rank, and, in, this, service, the, spanish, troops, were, to, be, mainly, employed, exactly, when, and, by, whom, the, nickname, the, silent, was, used, for, the, first, time, is, not, known, with, certainty, it, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, cardinal, de, granvelle, who, is, said, to, have, referred, to, william, as, the, silent, one, sometime, during, the, troubles, of, 1567, both, the, nickname, and, the, accompanying, anecdote, are, first, found, in, a, historical, source, from, the, early, 17th, century, in, the, netherlands, william, is, known, as, the, vader, des, vaderlands, father, of, the, fatherland, and, the, dutch, national, anthem, the, wilhelmus, was, written, in, his, honour, one, need, not, hope, to, undertake, nor, succeed, to, persevere, in, the, castle, of, buren, on, 6, july, 1551, the, 18, year, old, william, married, anna, van, egmond, en, buren, aged, 18, and, the, wealthy, heiress, to, the, lands, of, her, father, william, thus, gained, the, titles, lord, of, egmond, and, count, of, buren, the, couple, had, a, happy, marriage, and, became, the, parents, of, three, children, together, their, son, philip, william, would, succeed, william, as, prince, anna, died, on, 24, march, 1558, leaving, william, much, grieved, a, couple, of, years, after, anna, s, death, william, had, a, brief, relationship, with, eva, elincx, a, commoner, leading, to, the, birth, of, an, illegitimate, son, justinus, van, nassau, william, officially, recognised, justinus, as, his, son, and, took, responsibility, for, his, education, justinus, would, become, an, admiral, in, adult, life, on, 25, august, 1561, william, of, orange, married, for, the, second, time, his, new, wife, anna, of, saxony, was, tumultuous, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, william, married, her, to, gain, more, influence, in, saxony, hesse, and, the, palatinate, the, couple, had, two, sons, and, three, daughters, one, of, the, sons, died, in, infancy, and, the, other, son, the, famous, maurice, of, nassau, who, was, to, eventually, succeed, his, father, as, stadtholder, never, married, anna, died, after, william, renounced, her, and, her, own, family, imprisoned, her, in, one, of, their, castles, the, cause, was, due, to, the, accusation, that, she, committed, adultery, with, the, lawyer, jan, rubens, father, of, the, famous, painter, peter, paul, rubens, and, became, pregnant, by, him, giving, birth, to, a, daughter, before, her, death, william, had, already, announced, his, third, marriage, which, drew, the, disapproval, of, her, family, who, argued, that, despite, the, adultery, the, two, were, still, married, william, married, for, the, third, time, on, 12, june, 1575, to, charlotte, de, bourbon, montpensier, a, former, french, nun, who, was, also, popular, with, the, public, they, had, six, daughters, the, marriage, which, seems, to, have, been, a, love, match, on, both, sides, was, happy, charlotte, allegedly, died, from, exhaustion, while, trying, to, nurse, her, husband, after, an, assassination, attempt, in, 1582, though, william, was, outwardly, stoical, it, was, feared, that, his, grief, might, cause, a, fatal, relapse, charlotte, s, death, was, widely, mourned, william, married, for, the, fourth, and, final, time, on, 12, april, 1583, to, louise, de, coligny, a, french, huguenot, and, daughter, of, gaspard, de, coligny, she, was, to, be, the, mother, of, frederick, henry, 1584, 1647, william, s, fourth, legitimate, son, and, fifteenth, legitimate, child, this, youngest, of, william, s, children, who, was, born, only, a, few, months, before, william, s, death, was, to, be, the, only, one, of, his, sons, to, bear, children, and, carry, the, dynasty, forward, incidentally, frederick, henry, s, only, male, line, grandson, william, iii, would, become, king, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, but, he, would, die, childless, at, which, point, the, lineage, of, william, the, silent, would, end, to, be, succeeded, by, that, of, his, brother, john, vi, between, his, first, and, second, marriages, william, had, a, common, law, relationship, with, eva, elincx, they, had, a, son, justinus, van, nassau, 1559, 1631, whom, william, acknowledged, on, 4, december, 1597, justinus, van, nassau, married, anne, baronesse, de, m, rode,

france, or, the, imperial, habsburgs, as, holder, of, these, fiefs, he, was, inter, alia, william, used, two, sets, of, arms, in, his, lifetime, the, first, one, shown, below, was, his, ancestral, arms, of, nassau, the, second, arms, he, used, most, of, his, life, from, the, time, he, became, prince, of, orange, on, the, death, of, his, cousin, ren, of, ch, lon, he, placed, the, arms, of, ch,
