brahmagupta, c, 598, c, 668, ce, was, an, indian, mathematician, and, astronomer, he, is, the, author, of, two, early, works, on, mathematics, and, astronomy, the, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, bss, correctly, established, doctrine, of, brahma, dated, 628, a, theoretical, treatise, and, the, kha, akh, dyaka, edible, bite, dated, 665, a, more, practical, text, in, 628, ce, brahmagupta, first, described, gravity, as, an, attractive, force, and, used, the, term, gurutv, kar, a, am, in, sanskrit, to, describe, it, he, is, also, credited, with, the, first, clear, description, of, the, quadratic, formula, the, solution, of, the, quadratic, equation, in, his, main, work, the, br, hma, sphu, a, siddh, nta, brahmagupta, according, to, his, own, statement, was, born, in, 598, ce, born, in, bhillam, la, in, gurjaradesa, modern, bhinmal, in, rajasthan, india, during, the, reign, of, the, chavda, dynasty, ruler, vyagrahamukha, he, was, the, son, of, jishnugupta, and, was, a, hindu, by, religion, in, particular, a, shaivite, he, lived, and, worked, there, for, a, good, part, of, his, life, prithudaka, svamin, a, later, commentator, called, him, bhillamalacharya, the, teacher, from, bhillamala, bhillamala, was, the, capital, of, the, gurjaradesa, the, second, largest, kingdom, of, western, india, comprising, southern, rajasthan, and, northern, gujarat, in, modern, day, india, it, was, also, a, centre, of, learning, for, mathematics, and, astronomy, he, became, an, astronomer, of, the, brahmapaksha, school, one, of, the, four, major, schools, of, indian, astronomy, during, this, period, he, studied, the, five, traditional, siddhantas, on, indian, astronomy, as, well, as, the, work, of, other, astronomers, including, aryabhata, i, latadeva, pradyumna, varahamihira, simha, srisena, vijayanandin, and, vishnuchandra, in, the, year, 628, at, the, age, of, 30, he, composed, the, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, improved, treatise, of, brahma, which, is, believed, to, be, a, revised, version, of, the, received, siddhanta, of, the, brahmapaksha, school, of, astronomy, scholars, state, that, he, incorporated, a, great, deal, of, originality, into, his, revision, adding, a, considerable, amount, of, new, material, the, book, consists, of, 24, chapters, with, 1008, verses, in, the, rya, metre, a, good, deal, of, it, is, astronomy, but, it, also, contains, key, chapters, on, mathematics, including, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and, algorithmics, which, are, believed, to, contain, new, insights, due, to, brahmagupta, himself, later, brahmagupta, moved, to, ujjaini, avanti, a, major, centre, for, astronomy, in, central, india, at, the, age, of, 67, he, composed, his, next, well, known, work, khanda, kh, dyaka, a, practical, manual, of, indian, astronomy, in, the, karana, category, meant, to, be, used, by, students, brahmagupta, died, in, 668, ce, and, he, is, presumed, to, have, died, in, ujjain, brahmagupta, composed, the, following, treatises, brahmagupta, s, mathematical, advances, were, carried, on, further, by, bh, skara, ii, a, lineal, descendant, in, ujjain, who, described, brahmagupta, as, the, ganaka, chakra, chudamani, the, gem, of, the, circle, of, mathematicians, prithudaka, svamin, wrote, commentaries, on, both, of, his, works, rendering, difficult, verses, into, simpler, language, and, adding, illustrations, lalla, and, bhattotpala, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, wrote, commentaries, on, the, khanda, khadyaka, further, commentaries, continued, to, be, written, into, the, 12th, century, a, few, decades, after, the, death, of, brahmagupta, sindh, came, under, the, arab, caliphate, in, 712, ce, expeditions, were, sent, into, gurjaradesa, al, baylaman, in, jurz, as, per, arab, historians, the, kingdom, of, bhillamala, seems, to, have, been, annihilated, but, ujjain, repulsed, the, attacks, the, court, of, caliph, al, mansur, 754, 775, received, an, embassy, from, sindh, including, an, astrologer, called, kanaka, who, brought, possibly, memorised, astronomical, texts, including, those, of, brahmagupta, brahmagupta, s, texts, were, translated, into, arabic, by, muhammad, al, fazari, an, astronomer, in, al, mansur, s, court, under, the, names, sindhind, and, arakhand, an, immediate, outcome, was, the, spread, of, the, decimal, number, system, used, in, the, texts, the, mathematician, al, khwarizmi, 800, 850, ce, wrote, a, text, called, al, jam, wal, tafriq, bi, hisal, al, hind, addition, and, subtraction, in, indian, arithmetic, which, was, translated, into, latin, in, the, 13th, century, as, algorithmi, de, numero, indorum, through, these, texts, the, decimal, number, system, and, brahmagupta, s, algorithms, for, arithmetic, have, spread, throughout, the, world, al, khwarizmi, also, wrote, his, own, version, of, sindhind, drawing, on, al, fazari, s, version, and, incorporating, ptolemaic, elements, indian, astronomic, material, circulated, widely, for, centuries, even, making, its, way, into, medieval, latin, texts, the, historian, of, science, george, sarton, called, brahmagupta, one, of, the, greatest, scientists, of, his, race, and, the, greatest, of, his, time, brahmagupta, gave, the, solution, of, the, general, linear, equation, in, chapter, eighteen, of, brahmasphu, asiddh, nta, the, difference, between, rupas, when, inverted, and, divided, by, the, difference, of, the, of, the, is, the, unknown, in, the, equation, the, rupas, are, below, that, from, which, the, square, and, the, unknown, are, to, be, subtracted, which, is, a, solution, for, the, equation, bx, c, dx, e, where, rupas, refers, to, the, constants, c, and, e, the, solution, given, is, equivalent, to, x, e, c, b, d, he, further, gave, two, equivalent, solutions, to, the, general, quadratic, equation, 18, 44, diminish, by, the, middle, the, square, root, of, the, rupas, multiplied, by, four, times, the, square, and, increased, by, the, square, of, the, middle, divide, the, remainder, by, twice, the, square, the, middle, 18, 45, whatever, is, the, square, root, of, the, rupas, multiplied, by, the, square, increased, by, the, square, of, half, the, unknown, diminished, that, by, half, the, unknown, divide, by, its, square, the, unknown, which, are, respectively, solutions, for, the, equation, ax, 2, bx, c, equivalent, to, and, he, went, on, to, solve, systems, of, simultaneous, indeterminate, equations, stating, that, the, desired, variable, must, first, be, isolated, and, then, the, equation, must, be, divided, by, the, desired, variable, s, coefficient, in, particular, he, recommended, using, the, pulverizer, to, solve, equations, with, multiple, unknowns, 18, 51, subtract, the, colors, different, from, the, first, color, divided, by, the, first, is, the, measure, of, the, first, two, by, two, considered, similar, divisors, repeatedly, if, there, are, many, the, pulverizer, like, the, algebra, of, diophantus, the, algebra, of, brahmagupta, was, syncopated, addition, was, indicated, by, placing, the, numbers, side, by, side, subtraction, by, placing, a, dot, over, the, subtrahend, and, division, by, placing, the, divisor, below, the, dividend, similar, to, our, notation, but, without, the, bar, multiplication, evolution, and, unknown, quantities, were, represented, by, abbreviations, of, appropriate, terms, the, extent, of, greek, influence, on, this, syncopation, if, any, is, not, known, and, it, is, possible, that, both, greek, and, indian, syncopation, may, be, derived, from, a, common, babylonian, source, the, four, fundamental, operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, division, were, known, to, many, cultures, before, brahmagupta, this, current, system, is, based, on, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, and, first, appeared, in, the, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, brahmagupta, describes, multiplication, in, the, following, way, the, multiplicand, is, repeated, like, a, string, for, cattle, as, often, as, there, are, integrant, portions, in, the, multiplier, and, is, repeatedly, multiplied, by, them, and, the, products, are, added, together, it, is, multiplication, or, the, multiplicand, is, repeated, as, many, times, as, there, are, component, parts, in, the, multiplier, indian, arithmetic, was, known, in, medieval, europe, as, modus, indorum, meaning, method, of, the, indians, in, the, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, four, methods, for, multiplication, were, described, including, gom, trik, which, is, said, to, be, close, to, the, present, day, methods, in, the, beginning, of, chapter, twelve, of, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, entitled, calculation, he, also, details, operations, on, fractions, the, reader, is, expected, to, know, the, basic, arithmetic, operations, as, far, as, taking, the, square, root, although, he, explains, how, to, find, the, cube, and, cube, root, of, an, integer, and, later, gives, rules, facilitating, the, computation, of, squares, and, square, roots, he, then, gives, rules, for, dealing, with, five, types, of, combinations, of, fractions, a, c, b, c, a, c, b, d, a, 1, b, d, a, c, b, d, a, c, a, d, b, cd, and, a, c, b, d, a, c, a, d, b, cd, brahmagupta, then, goes, on, to, give, the, sum, of, the, squares, and, cubes, of, the, first, n, integers, 12, 20, the, sum, of, the, squares, is, that, multiplied, by, twice, the, step, increased, by, one, divided, by, three, the, sum, of, the, cubes, is, the, square, of, that, piles, of, these, with, identical, balls, here, brahmagupta, found, the, result, in, terms, of, the, sum, of, the, first, n, integers, rather, than, in, terms, of, n, as, is, the, modern, practice, he, gives, the, sum, of, the, squares, of, the, first, n, natural, numbers, as, n, n, 1, 2, n, 1, 6, and, the, sum, of, the, cubes, of, the, first, n, natural, numbers, as, n, n, 1, 2, 2, brahmagupta, s, brahmasphu, asiddh, nta, is, the, first, book, that, provides, rules, for, arithmetic, manipulations, that, apply, to, zero, and, to, negative, numbers, the, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, is, the, earliest, known, text, to, treat, zero, as, a, number, in, its, own, right, rather, than, as, simply, a, placeholder, digit, in, representing, another, number, as, was, done, by, the, babylonians, or, as, a, symbol, for, lack, of, quantity, as, was, done, by, ptolemy, and, the, romans, in, chapter, eighteen, of, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, brahmagupta, describes, operations, on, negative, numbers, he, first, describes, addition, and, subtraction, 18, 30, of, two, positives, is, positives, of, two, negatives, negative, of, a, positive, and, a, negative, is, their, difference, if, they, are, equal, it, is, zero, the, sum, of, a, negative, and, zero, is, negative, of, a, positive, and, zero, positives, of, two, zeros, zero, 18, 32, a, negative, minus, zero, is, negative, a, positive, is, positive, zero, is, zero, when, a, positive, is, to, be, subtracted, from, a, negative, or, a, negative, from, a, positive, then, it, is, to, be, added, he, goes, on, to, describe, multiplication, 18, 33, the, product, of, a, negative, and, a, positive, is, negative, of, two, negatives, positive, and, of, positives, positive, the, product, of, zero, and, a, negative, of, zero, and, a, positive, or, of, two, zeros, is, zero, but, his, description, of, division, by, zero, differs, from, our, modern, understanding, 18, 34, a, positive, divided, by, a, positive, or, a, negative, divided, by, a, negative, is, positive, a, zero, divided, by, zero, is, zero, a, positive, divided, by, a, negative, is, negative, a, negative, divided, by, a, positive, is, negative, 18, 35, a, negative, or, a, positive, divided, by, zero, has, that, as, its, divisor, or, zero, divided, by, a, negative, or, a, positive, the, square, of, a, negative, or, positive, is, positive, of, zero, is, zero, that, of, which, is, the, square, is, square, root, here, brahmagupta, states, that, 0, 0, 0, and, as, for, the, question, of, a, 0, where, a, 0, he, did, not, commit, himself, his, rules, for, arithmetic, on, negative, numbers, and, zero, are, quite, close, to, the, modern, understanding, except, that, in, modern, mathematics, division, by, zero, is, left, undefined, in, chapter, twelve, of, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, brahmagupta, provides, a, formula, useful, for, generating, pythagorean, triples, 12, 39, the, height, of, a, mountain, multiplied, by, a, given, multiplier, is, the, distance, to, a, city, it, is, not, erased, when, it, is, divided, by, the, multiplier, increased, by, two, it, is, the, leap, of, one, of, the, two, who, make, the, same, journey, or, in, other, words, if, d, mx, x, 2, then, a, traveller, who, leaps, vertically, upwards, a, distance, d, from, the, top, of, a, mountain, of, height, m, and, then, travels, in, a, straight, line, to, a, city, at, a, horizontal, distance, mx, from, the, base, of, the, mountain, travels, the, same, distance, as, one, who, descends, vertically, down, the, mountain, and, then, travels, along, the, horizontal, to, the, city, stated, geometrically, this, says, that, if, a, right, angled, triangle, has, a, base, of, length, a, mx, and, altitude, of, length, b, m, d, then, the, length, c, of, its, hypotenuse, is, given, by, c, m, 1, x, d, and, indeed, elementary, algebraic, manipulation, shows, that, a, 2, b, 2, c, 2, whenever, d, has, the, value, stated, also, if, m, and, x, are, rational, so, are, d, a, b, and, c, a, pythagorean, triple, can, therefore, be, obtained, from, a, b, and, c, by, multiplying, each, of, them, by, the, least, common, multiple, of, their, denominators, brahmagupta, went, on, to, give, a, recurrence, relation, for, generating, solutions, to, certain, instances, of, diophantine, equations, of, the, second, degree, such, as, nx, 2, 1, y, 2, called, pell, s, equation, by, using, the, euclidean, algorithm, the, euclidean, algorithm, was, known, to, him, as, the, pulverizer, since, it, breaks, numbers, down, into, ever, smaller, pieces, the, nature, of, squares, 18, 64, twice, the, square, root, of, a, given, square, by, a, multiplier, and, increased, or, diminished, by, an, arbitrary, the, product, of, the, first, multiplied, by, the, multiplier, with, the, product, of, the, last, is, the, last, computed, 18, 65, the, sum, of, the, thunderbolt, products, is, the, first, the, additive, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, additives, the, two, square, roots, divided, by, the, additive, or, the, subtractive, are, the, additive, rupas, the, key, to, his, solution, was, the, identity, which, is, a, generalisation, of, an, identity, that, was, discovered, by, diophantus, using, his, identity, and, the, fact, that, if, x, 1, y, 1, and, x, 2, y, 2, are, solutions, to, the, equations, x, 2, ny, 2, k, 1, and, x, 2, ny, 2, k, 2, respectively, then, x, 1, x, 2, ny, 1, y, 2, x, 1, y, 2, x, 2, y, 1, is, a, solution, to, x, 2, ny, 2, k, 1, k, 2, he, was, able, to, find, integral, solutions, to, pell, s, equation, through, a, series, of, equations, of, the, form, x, 2, ny, 2, k, i, brahmagupta, was, not, able, to, apply, his, solution, uniformly, for, all, possible, values, of, n, rather, he, was, only, able, to, show, that, if, x, 2, ny, 2, k, has, an, integer, solution, for, k, 1, 2, or, 4, then, x, 2, ny, 2, 1, has, a, solution, the, solution, of, the, general, pell, s, equation, would, have, to, wait, for, bh, skara, ii, in, c, 1150, ce, brahmagupta, s, most, famous, result, in, geometry, is, his, formula, for, cyclic, quadrilaterals, given, the, lengths, of, the, sides, of, any, cyclic, quadrilateral, brahmagupta, gave, an, approximate, and, an, exact, formula, for, the, figure, s, area, 12, 21, the, approximate, area, is, the, product, of, the, halves, of, the, sums, of, the, sides, and, opposite, sides, of, a, triangle, and, a, quadrilateral, the, accurate, is, the, square, root, from, the, product, of, the, halves, of, the, sums, of, the, sides, diminished, by, side, of, the, quadrilateral, so, given, the, lengths, p, q, r, and, s, of, a, cyclic, quadrilateral, the, approximate, area, is, p, r, 2, q, s, 2, while, letting, t, p, q, r, s, 2, the, exact, area, is, although, brahmagupta, does, not, explicitly, state, that, these, quadrilaterals, are, cyclic, it, is, apparent, from, his, rules, that, this, is, the, case, heron, s, formula, is, a, special, case, of, this, formula, and, it, can, be, derived, by, setting, one, of, the, sides, equal, to, zero, brahmagupta, dedicated, a, substantial, portion, of, his, work, to, geometry, one, theorem, gives, the, lengths, of, the, two, segments, a, triangle, s, base, is, divided, into, by, its, altitude, 12, 22, the, base, decreased, and, increased, by, the, difference, between, the, squares, of, the, sides, divided, by, the, base, when, divided, by, two, they, are, the, true, segments, the, perpendicular, is, the, square, root, from, the, square, of, a, side, diminished, by, the, square, of, its, segment, thus, the, lengths, of, the, two, segments, are, 1, 2, b, c, 2, a, 2, b, he, further, gives, a, theorem, on, rational, triangles, a, triangle, with, rational, sides, a, b, c, and, rational, area, is, of, the, form, for, some, rational, numbers, u, v, and, w, brahmagupta, continues, 12, 23, the, square, root, of, the, sum, of, the, two, products, of, the, sides, and, opposite, sides, of, a, non, unequal, quadrilateral, is, the, diagonal, the, square, of, the, diagonal, is, diminished, by, the, square, of, half, the, sum, of, the, base, and, the, top, the, square, root, is, the, perpendicular, so, in, a, non, unequal, cyclic, quadrilateral, that, is, an, isosceles, trapezoid, the, length, of, each, diagonal, is, pr, qs, he, continues, to, give, formulas, for, the, lengths, and, areas, of, geometric, figures, such, as, the, circumradius, of, an, isosceles, trapezoid, and, a, scalene, quadrilateral, and, the, lengths, of, diagonals, in, a, scalene, cyclic, quadrilateral, this, leads, up, to, brahmagupta, s, famous, theorem, 12, 30, 31, imaging, two, triangles, within, with, unequal, sides, the, two, diagonals, are, the, two, bases, their, two, segments, are, separately, the, upper, and, lower, segments, at, the, intersection, of, the, diagonals, the, two, of, the, two, diagonals, are, two, sides, in, a, triangle, the, base, its, perpendicular, is, the, lower, portion, of, the, perpendicular, the, upper, portion, of, the, perpendicular, is, half, of, the, sum, of, the, perpendiculars, diminished, by, the, lower, in, verse, 40, he, gives, values, of, 12, 40, the, diameter, and, the, square, of, the, radius, multiplied, by, 3, are, the, practical, circumference, and, the, area, the, accurate, are, the, square, roots, from, the, squares, of, those, two, multiplied, by, ten, so, brahmagupta, uses, 3, as, a, practical, value, of, and, 10, 3, 1622, displaystyle, sqrt, 10, approx, 3, 1622, ldots, as, an, accurate, value, of, with, an, error, less, than, 1, in, some, of, the, verses, before, verse, 40, brahmagupta, gives, constructions, of, various, figures, with, arbitrary, sides, he, essentially, manipulated, right, triangles, to, produce, isosceles, triangles, scalene, triangles, rectangles, isosceles, trapezoids, isosceles, trapezoids, with, three, equal, sides, and, a, scalene, cyclic, quadrilateral, after, giving, the, value, of, pi, he, deals, with, the, geometry, of, plane, figures, and, solids, such, as, finding, volumes, and, surface, areas, or, empty, spaces, dug, out, of, solids, he, finds, the, volume, of, rectangular, prisms, pyramids, and, the, frustum, of, a, square, pyramid, he, further, finds, the, average, depth, of, a, series, of, pits, for, the, volume, of, a, frustum, of, a, pyramid, he, gives, the, pragmatic, value, as, the, depth, times, the, square, of, the, mean, of, the, edges, of, the, top, and, bottom, faces, and, he, gives, the, superficial, volume, as, the, depth, times, their, mean, area, in, chapter, 2, of, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, entitled, planetary, true, longitudes, brahmagupta, presents, a, sine, table, 2, 2, 5, the, sines, the, progenitors, twins, ursa, major, twins, the, vedas, the, gods, fires, six, flavors, dice, the, gods, the, moon, five, the, sky, the, moon, the, moon, arrows, suns, here, brahmagupta, uses, names, of, objects, to, represent, the, digits, of, place, value, numerals, as, was, common, with, numerical, data, in, sanskrit, treatises, progenitors, represents, the, 14, progenitors, manu, in, indian, cosmology, or, 14, twins, means, 2, ursa, major, represents, the, seven, stars, of, ursa, major, or, 7, vedas, refers, to, the, 4, vedas, or, 4, dice, represents, the, number, of, sides, of, the, traditional, die, or, 6, and, so, on, this, information, can, be, translated, into, the, list, of, sines, 214, 427, 638, 846, 1051, 1251, 1446, 1635, 1817, 1991, 2156, 2312, 2459, 2594, 2719, 2832, 2933, 3021, 3096, 3159, 3207, 3242, 3263, and, 3270, with, the, radius, being, 3270, this, numbers, represent, 3270, sin, n, 48, displaystyle, 3270, sin, frac, pi, n, 48, for, n, 1, 24, displaystyle, n, 1, dots, 24, in, 665, brahmagupta, devised, and, used, a, special, case, of, the, newton, stirling, interpolation, formula, of, the, second, order, to, interpolate, new, values, of, the, sine, function, from, other, values, already, tabulated, the, formula, gives, an, estimate, for, the, value, of, a, function, f, at, a, value, a, xh, of, its, argument, with, h, 0, and, 1, x, 1, when, its, value, is, already, known, at, a, h, a, and, a, h, the, formula, for, the, estimate, is, where, is, the, first, order, forward, difference, operator, i, e, brahmagupta, in, 628, first, described, gravity, as, an, attractive, force, using, the, term, gurutv, kar, a, am, to, describe, it, the, earth, on, all, its, sides, is, the, same, all, people, on, the, earth, stand, upright, and, all, heavy, things, fall, down, to, the, earth, by, a, law, of, nature, for, it, is, the, nature, of, the, earth, to, attract, and, to, keep, things, as, it, is, the, nature, of, water, to, flow, if, a, thing, wants, to, go, deeper, down, than, the, earth, let, it, try, the, earth, is, the, only, low, thing, and, seeds, always, return, to, it, in, whatever, direction, you, may, throw, them, away, and, never, rise, upwards, from, the, earth, brahmagupta, directed, a, great, deal, of, criticism, towards, the, work, of, rival, astronomers, and, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, displays, one, of, the, earliest, schisms, among, indian, mathematicians, the, division, was, primarily, about, the, application, of, mathematics, to, the, physical, world, rather, than, about, the, mathematics, itself, in, brahmagupta, s, case, the, disagreements, stemmed, largely, from, the, choice, of, astronomical, parameters, and, theories, critiques, of, rival, theories, appear, throughout, the, first, ten, astronomical, chapters, and, the, eleventh, chapter, is, entirely, devoted, to, criticism, of, these, theories, although, no, criticisms, appear, in, the, twelfth, and, eighteenth, chapters, in, chapter, seven, of, his, br, hmasphu, asiddh, nta, entitled, lunar, crescent, brahmagupta, rebuts, the, idea, that, the, moon, is, farther, from, the, earth, than, the, sun, he, does, this, by, explaining, the, illumination, of, the, moon, by, the, sun, 1, if, the, moon, were, above, the, sun, how, would, the, power, of, waxing, and, waning, etc, be, produced, from, calculation, of, the, longitude, of, the, moon, the, near, half, would, always, be, bright, 2, in, the, same, way, that, the, half, seen, by, the, sun, of, a, pot, standing, in, sunlight, is, bright, and, the, unseen, half, dark, so, is, of, the, moon, beneath, the, sun, 3, the, brightness, is, increased, in, the, direction, of, the, sun, at, the, end, of, a, bright, half, month, the, near, half, is, bright, and, the, far, half, dark, hence, the, elevation, of, the, horns, from, calculation, he, explains, that, since, the, moon, is, closer, to, the, earth, than, the, sun, the, degree, of, the, illuminated, part, of, the, moon, depends, on, the, relative, positions, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, and, this, can, be, computed, from, the, size, of, the, angle, between, the, two, bodies, further, work, exploring, the, longitudes, of, the, planets, diurnal, rotation, lunar, and, solar, eclipses, risings, and, settings, the, moon, s, crescent, and, conjunctions, of, the, planets, are, discussed, in, his, treatise, khandakhadyaka
