tertullian, t, r, t, l, i, n, latin, quintus, septimius, florens, tertullianus, c, 155, c, 220, ad, was, a, prolific, early, christian, author, from, carthage, in, the, roman, province, of, africa, he, was, the, first, christian, author, to, produce, an, extensive, corpus, of, latin, christian, literature, and, was, an, early, christian, apologist, and, a, polemicist, against, heresy, including, contemporary, christian, gnosticism, tertullian, has, been, called, the, father, of, latin, christianity, as, well, as, the, founder, of, western, theology, tertullian, originated, new, theological, concepts, and, advanced, the, development, of, early, church, doctrine, he, is, perhaps, most, famous, for, being, the, first, writer, in, latin, known, to, use, the, term, trinity, latin, trinitas, however, some, of, his, teachings, such, as, the, subordination, of, the, son, and, spirit, to, the, father, were, later, rejected, by, the, church, according, to, jerome, he, later, joined, the, montanist, sect, and, may, have, apostasized, however, modern, scholars, dispute, this, scant, reliable, evidence, exists, regarding, tertullian, s, life, most, knowledge, comes, from, passing, references, in, his, own, writings, roman, africa, was, famous, as, the, home, of, orators, and, that, influence, can, be, seen, in, his, writing, style, with, its, archaisms, or, provincialisms, its, glowing, imagery, and, its, passionate, temper, he, was, a, scholar, with, an, excellent, education, he, wrote, at, least, three, books, in, koine, greek, in, them, he, refers, to, himself, but, none, of, them, are, extant, some, sources, describe, him, as, berber, the, linguist, ren, braun, suggested, that, he, was, of, punic, origin, but, acknowledged, that, it, is, difficult, to, decide, since, the, heritage, of, carthage, had, become, common, to, the, berbers, tertullian, s, own, understanding, of, his, ethnicity, has, been, questioned, he, referred, to, himself, as, poenicum, inter, romanos, lit, punic, among, romans, in, his, book, de, pallio, and, claimed, africa, as, his, patria, according, to, church, tradition, tertullian, was, raised, in, carthage, and, was, thought, to, be, the, son, of, a, roman, centurion, tertullian, has, been, claimed, to, have, been, a, trained, lawyer, and, an, ordained, priest, those, assertions, rely, on, the, accounts, of, eusebius, of, caesarea, church, history, ii, ii, 4, and, jerome, s, de, viris, illustribus, on, famous, men, chapter, 53, jerome, claimed, that, tertullian, s, father, held, the, position, of, centurio, proconsularis, aide, de, camp, in, the, roman, army, in, africa, further, tertullian, has, been, thought, to, be, a, lawyer, based, on, his, use, of, legal, analogies, and, on, an, identification, of, him, with, the, jurist, tertullianus, who, is, quoted, in, the, pandects, although, tertullian, used, a, knowledge, of, roman, law, in, his, writings, his, legal, knowledge, does, not, demonstrably, exceed, what, could, be, expected, from, a, sufficient, roman, education, the, writings, of, tertullianus, a, lawyer, of, the, same, agnomen, exist, only, in, fragments, and, do, not, explicitly, denote, a, christian, authorship, finally, any, notion, of, tertullian, being, a, priest, is, also, questionable, in, his, extant, writings, he, never, describes, himself, as, ordained, in, the, church, and, seems, to, place, himself, among, the, laity, his, conversion, to, christianity, perhaps, took, place, about, 197, 198, cf, adolf, harnack, bonwetsch, and, others, but, its, immediate, antecedents, are, unknown, except, as, they, are, conjectured, from, his, writings, the, event, must, have, been, sudden, and, decisive, transforming, at, once, his, own, personality, he, writes, that, he, could, not, imagine, a, truly, christian, life, without, such, a, conscious, breach, a, radical, act, of, conversion, christians, are, made, not, born, apol, xviii, two, books, addressed, to, his, wife, confirm, that, he, was, married, to, a, christian, wife, in, his, middle, life, about, 207, he, was, attracted, to, the, new, prophecy, of, montanism, but, today, most, scholars, reject, the, assertion, that, tertullian, left, the, mainstream, church, or, was, excommunicated, e, are, left, to, ask, whether, saint, cyprian, could, have, regarded, tertullian, as, his, master, if, tertullian, had, been, a, notorious, schismatic, since, no, ancient, writer, was, more, definite, if, not, indeed, fanatical, on, this, subject, of, schism, than, saint, cyprian, the, question, must, surely, be, answered, in, the, negative, in, the, time, of, augustine, a, group, of, tertullianists, still, had, a, basilica, in, carthage, which, within, the, same, period, passed, to, the, orthodox, church, it, is, unclear, whether, the, name, was, merely, another, for, the, north, african, montanists, or, that, it, means, that, tertullian, later, split, with, the, montanists, and, founded, his, own, group, jerome, says, that, tertullian, lived, to, old, age, by, the, doctrinal, works, he, published, tertullian, became, the, teacher, of, cyprian, and, the, predecessor, of, augustine, who, in, turn, became, the, chief, founder, of, latin, theology, thirty, one, works, are, extant, together, with, fragments, of, more, some, fifteen, works, in, latin, or, greek, are, lost, some, as, recently, as, the, 9th, century, de, paradiso, de, superstitione, saeculi, de, carne, et, anima, were, all, extant, in, the, now, damaged, codex, agobardinus, in, 814, ad, tertullian, s, writings, cover, the, whole, theological, field, of, the, time, apologetics, against, paganism, and, judaism, polemics, polity, discipline, and, morals, or, the, whole, reorganization, of, human, life, on, a, christian, basis, they, gave, a, picture, of, the, religious, life, and, thought, of, the, time, which, is, of, great, interest, to, the, church, historian, like, other, early, christian, writers, tertullian, used, the, term, paganus, to, mean, civilian, as, a, contrast, to, the, soldiers, of, christ, the, motif, of, miles, christi, did, not, assume, the, literal, meaning, of, participation, in, war, until, church, doctrines, justifying, christian, participation, in, battle, were, developed, around, the, 5th, century, in, the, 2nd, century, writings, of, tertullian, paganus, meant, a, civilian, who, was, lacking, self, discipline, in, de, corona, militis, xi, v, he, writes, the, chronology, of, his, writings, is, difficult, to, fix, with, certainty, in, his, work, against, marcion, which, he, calls, his, third, composition, on, the, marcionite, heresy, he, gives, its, date, as, the, fifteenth, year, of, the, reign, of, severus, adv, marcionem, i, 1, 15, which, would, be, approximately, 208, the, writings, may, be, divided, according, to, their, subject, matter, falling, into, two, groups, apologetic, and, polemic, writings, like, apologeticus, de, testimonio, animae, the, anti, jewish, adversus, iudaeos, adv, marcionem, adv, praxeam, adv, hermogenem, de, praescriptione, hereticorum, and, scorpiace, were, written, to, counteract, gnosticism, and, other, religious, or, philosophical, doctrines, the, other, group, consists, of, practical, and, disciplinary, writings, e, g, de, monogamia, ad, uxorem, de, virginibus, velandis, de, cultu, feminarum, de, patientia, de, pudicitia, de, oratione, and, ad, martyras, among, his, apologetic, writings, the, apologeticus, addressed, to, the, roman, magistrates, is, a, most, pungent, defense, of, christianity, and, the, christians, against, the, reproaches, of, the, pagans, and, an, important, legacy, of, the, ancient, church, proclaiming, the, principle, of, freedom, of, religion, as, an, inalienable, human, right, and, demanding, a, fair, trial, for, christians, before, they, are, condemned, to, death, tertullian, was, the, first, to, disprove, charges, that, christians, sacrificed, infants, at, the, celebration, of, the, lord, s, supper, and, committed, incest, he, pointed, to, the, commission, of, such, crimes, in, the, pagan, world, and, then, proved, by, the, testimony, of, pliny, the, younger, that, christians, pledged, themselves, not, to, commit, murder, adultery, or, other, crimes, he, adduced, the, inhumanity, of, pagan, customs, such, as, feeding, the, flesh, of, gladiators, to, beasts, he, argued, that, the, gods, have, no, existence, and, thus, there, is, no, pagan, religion, against, which, christians, may, offend, christians, do, not, engage, in, the, foolish, worship, of, the, emperors, that, they, do, better, they, pray, for, them, and, that, christians, can, afford, to, be, put, to, torture, and, to, death, and, the, more, they, are, cast, down, the, more, they, grow, the, blood, of, the, christians, is, seed, apologeticum, 50, in, the, de, praescriptione, he, develops, as, its, fundamental, idea, that, in, a, dispute, between, the, church, and, a, separating, party, the, whole, burden, of, proof, lies, with, the, latter, as, the, church, in, possession, of, the, unbroken, tradition, is, by, its, very, existence, a, guarantee, of, its, truth, the, five, books, against, marcion, written, in, 207, or, 208, are, the, most, comprehensive, and, elaborate, of, his, polemical, works, invaluable, for, gauging, the, early, christian, view, of, gnosticism, tertullian, has, been, identified, by, jo, ann, mcnamara, as, the, person, who, originally, invested, the, consecrated, virgin, as, the, bride, of, christ, which, helped, to, bring, the, independent, virgin, under, patriarchal, rule, scholars, in, the, past, accepting, the, montanist, theory, have, also, divided, his, work, into, earlier, catholic, works, and, the, later, supposedly, montanist, works, cf, harnack, ii, 262, sqq, aiming, to, show, the, change, of, views, tertullian, s, mind, underwent, the, earliest, manuscript, handwritten, copy, of, any, of, tertullian, s, works, dates, to, the, eighth, century, but, most, are, of, the, fifteenth, there, are, five, main, collections, of, tertullian, s, works, known, as, the, cluniacense, corbeiense, trecense, agobardinum, and, ottobonianus, some, of, tertullian, s, works, are, lost, all, the, manuscripts, of, the, corbeiense, collection, are, also, now, lost, although, the, collection, survives, in, early, printed, editions, tertullian, s, main, doctrinal, teachings, are, as, follows, tertullian, reserves, the, appellation, god, in, the, sense, of, the, ultimate, originator, of, all, things, to, the, father, who, made, the, world, out, of, nothing, though, his, son, the, word, has, corporeity, though, he, is, a, spirit, de, praescriptione, vii, adv, praxeam, vii, however, tertullian, used, corporeal, only, in, the, stoic, sense, to, mean, something, with, actual, material, existence, rather, than, the, later, idea, of, flesh, tertullian, is, often, considered, an, early, proponent, of, the, nicene, doctrine, approaching, the, subject, from, the, standpoint, of, the, logos, doctrine, though, he, did, not, state, the, later, doctrine, of, the, immanent, trinity, in, his, treatise, against, praxeas, who, taught, patripassianism, in, rome, he, used, the, words, trinity, economy, used, in, reference, to, the, three, persons, persons, and, substance, maintaining, the, distinction, of, the, son, from, the, father, as, the, unoriginate, god, and, the, spirit, from, both, the, father, and, the, son, adv, praxeam, xxv, these, three, are, one, substance, not, one, person, and, it, is, said, i, and, my, father, are, one, in, respect, not, of, the, singularity, of, number, but, the, unity, of, the, substance, the, very, names, father, and, son, indicate, the, distinction, of, personality, the, father, is, one, the, son, is, another, and, the, spirit, is, another, dico, alium, esse, patrem, et, alium, filium, et, alium, spiritum, adv, praxeam, ix, and, yet, in, defending, the, unity, of, god, he, says, the, son, is, not, other, alius, a, patre, filius, non, est, adv, prax, 18, as, a, result, of, receiving, a, portion, of, the, father, s, substance, at, times, speaking, of, the, father, and, the, son, tertullian, refers, to, two, gods, he, says, that, all, things, of, the, father, belong, also, to, the, son, including, his, names, such, as, almighty, god, most, high, lord, of, hosts, or, king, of, israel, though, tertullian, considered, the, father, to, be, god, yahweh, he, responded, to, criticism, of, the, modalist, praxeas, that, this, meant, that, tertullian, s, christianity, was, not, monotheistic, by, noting, that, even, though, there, was, one, god, yahweh, who, became, the, father, when, the, son, became, his, agent, of, creation, the, son, could, also, be, referred, to, as, god, when, referred, to, apart, from, the, father, because, the, son, though, subordinate, to, god, is, entitled, to, be, called, god, from, the, unity, of, the, father, in, regards, to, being, formed, from, a, portion, of, his, substance, the, catholic, encyclopedia, comments, that, for, tertullian, there, was, a, time, when, there, was, no, son, and, no, sin, when, god, was, neither, father, nor, judge, similarly, j, n, d, kelly, stated, tertullian, followed, the, apologists, in, dating, his, perfect, generation, from, his, extrapolation, for, the, work, of, creation, prior, to, that, moment, god, could, not, strictly, be, said, to, have, had, a, son, while, after, it, the, term, father, which, for, earlier, theologians, generally, connoted, god, as, author, of, reality, began, to, acquire, the, specialized, meaning, of, father, of, the, son, as, regards, the, subjects, of, subordination, of, the, son, to, the, father, the, new, catholic, encyclopedia, has, commented, in, not, a, few, areas, of, theology, tertullian, s, views, are, of, course, completely, unacceptable, thus, for, example, his, teaching, on, the, trinity, reveals, a, subordination, of, son, to, father, that, in, the, later, crass, form, of, arianism, the, church, rejected, as, heretical, though, he, did, not, fully, state, the, doctrine, of, the, immanence, of, the, trinity, according, to, b, b, warfield, he, went, a, long, distance, in, the, way, of, approach, to, it, tertullian, was, a, defender, of, the, necessity, of, apostolicity, in, his, prescription, against, heretics, he, explicitly, challenges, heretics, to, produce, evidence, of, the, apostolic, succession, of, their, communities, unlike, many, early, christian, writers, tertullian, along, with, clement, of, alexandria, used, the, word, figure, and, symbol, to, define, the, eucharist, since, in, his, book, against, marcion, implied, that, this, is, my, body, should, be, interpreted, as, a, figure, of, my, body, while, others, have, also, suggested, that, he, believed, in, a, spiritual, presence, in, the, eucharist, tertullian, advises, the, postponement, of, baptism, of, little, children, and, the, unmarried, he, mentions, that, it, was, customary, to, baptise, infants, with, sponsors, speaking, on, their, behalf, he, argued, that, an, infant, ran, the, risk, of, growing, up, and, then, falling, into, sin, which, could, cause, them, to, lose, their, salvation, if, they, were, baptized, as, infants, contrary, to, early, syrian, baptismal, doctrine, and, practice, tertullian, describes, baptism, as, a, cleansing, and, preparation, process, which, precedes, the, reception, of, the, holy, spirit, in, post, baptismal, anointing, de, baptismo, 6, de, baptismo, includes, the, earliest, known, mention, of, a, prayer, for, the, consecration, of, the, waters, of, baptism, this, invocation, may, suggest, a, change, in, practice, from, baptizing, in, living, or, running, water, where, the, spirit, was, believed, to, be, present, to, baptizing, in, still, water, tertullian, had, an, ex, opere, operato, view, of, the, baptism, thus, the, efficiency, of, baptism, was, not, dependent, upon, the, faith, of, the, receiver, he, also, believed, that, in, an, emergency, the, laity, can, give, the, baptism, tertullian, interpreted, that, in, matthew, 16, 18, 19, the, rock, refers, to, peter, for, him, peter, is, the, type, of, the, one, church, and, its, origins, this, church, is, now, present, in, a, variety, of, local, churches, he, also, believed, that, the, power, to, bind, and, unbind, has, passed, from, peter, to, the, apostles, and, prophets, of, the, montanist, church, not, the, bishops, he, mocked, pope, calixtus, or, agrippinus, it, is, debated, which, one, he, was, referring, to, when, he, challenged, him, on, the, church, forgiving, capital, sinners, and, letting, them, back, into, the, church, he, believed, that, the, people, who, committed, grave, sins, such, as, sorcery, fornication, and, murder, should, not, be, let, inside, the, church, as, a, montanist, he, attacked, the, church, authorities, as, more, interested, in, their, own, political, power, in, the, church, than, in, listening, to, the, spirit, tertullian, s, criticism, of, church, authorities, has, been, compared, to, the, protestant, reformation, tertullian, s, later, view, of, marriage, such, as, in, his, book, exhortation, to, chastity, may, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, montanism, he, had, previously, held, marriage, to, be, fundamentally, good, but, after, his, conversion, he, denied, its, goodness, he, argues, that, marriage, is, considered, to, be, good, when, it, is, compared, with, the, greatest, of, all, evils, he, argued, that, before, the, coming, of, christ, the, command, to, reproduce, was, a, prophetic, sign, pointing, to, the, coming, of, the, church, after, it, came, the, command, was, superseded, he, also, believed, lust, for, one, s, wife, and, for, another, woman, were, essentially, the, same, so, that, marital, desire, was, similar, to, adulterous, desire, he, believed, that, sex, even, in, marriage, would, disrupt, the, christian, life, and, that, abstinence, was, the, best, way, to, achieve, the, clarity, of, the, soul, tertullian, s, views, would, later, influence, much, of, the, western, church, tertullian, was, the, first, to, introduce, a, view, of, sexual, hierarchy, he, believed, that, those, who, abstain, from, sexual, relations, should, have, a, higher, hierarchy, in, the, church, than, those, who, do, not, because, he, saw, sexual, relations, as, a, barrier, that, stopped, one, from, a, close, relationship, with, god, tertullian, did, not, have, a, specific, listing, of, the, canon, however, he, quotes, 1, john, 1, peter, jude, revelation, the, pauline, epistles, and, the, four, gospels, in, his, later, books, he, also, started, to, use, the, shepherd, of, hermas, tertullian, made, no, references, to, the, book, of, tobit, however, in, his, book, adversus, marcionem, he, quotes, the, book, of, judith, he, quoted, most, of, the, old, testament, including, many, deuterocanonical, books, however, he, never, used, the, books, of, chronicles, ruth, esther, 2, maccabees, 2, john, and, 3, john, he, defended, the, book, of, enoch, and, he, believed, that, the, book, was, omitted, by, the, jews, from, the, canon, he, believed, that, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, was, made, by, barnabas, for, tertullian, scripture, was, authoritative, he, used, scripture, as, the, primary, source, in, almost, every, chapter, of, his, every, work, and, very, rarely, anything, else, he, seems, to, prioritize, the, authority, of, scripture, above, anything, else, when, interpreting, scripture, he, would, occasionally, believe, passages, to, be, allegorical, or, symbolic, while, in, other, places, he, would, support, a, literal, interpretation, he, would, especially, use, allegorical, interpretations, when, dealing, with, christological, prophecies, of, the, old, testament, he, also, included, the, belief, of, the, simplicity, of, scripture, he, believed, that, scripture, interprets, itself, for, him, scripture, must, be, interpreted, in, the, light, of, a, greater, number, of, texts, and, they, need, to, agree, with, each, other, tertullian, denied, mary, s, virginity, in, partu, and, he, was, quoted, by, helvidius, in, his, debate, with, jerome, he, held, similar, views, as, antidicomarians, j, n, d, kelly, argued, that, tertullian, believed, that, mary, had, imperfections, thus, denying, her, sinlessness, tertullian, is, said, to, have, held, to, a, view, similar, to, the, protestant, priesthood, of, all, believers, and, that, the, distinction, of, the, clergy, and, the, laity, is, only, because, of, ecclesiastical, institution, and, thus, in, an, absence, of, a, priest, the, laity, can, act, as, priests, his, theory, on, the, distinction, of, the, laity, and, clergy, is, influenced, by, montanism, and, his, early, writings, do, not, have, the, same, beliefs, he, believed, in, iconoclasm, he, believed, in, historic, premillennialism, that, christians, will, go, through, a, period, of, tribulation, to, be, followed, by, a, literal, 1000, year, reign, of, christ, he, attacked, the, use, of, greek, philosophy, in, christian, theology, for, him, philosophy, supported, religious, idolatry, and, heresy, he, believed, that, many, people, became, heretical, because, of, relying, on, philosophy, he, stated, what, has, athens, to, do, with, jerusalem, tertullian, s, views, of, angels, and, demons, were, influenced, by, the, book, of, enoch, he, held, that, the, nephilim, were, born, out, of, fallen, angels, who, mingled, with, human, women, and, had, sexual, relations, he, believed, that, because, of, the, actions, of, the, watchers, as, described, in, the, book, of, enoch, men, would, later, judge, angels, he, believed, that, angels, are, inferior, to, humans, and, not, made, in, the, image, of, god, he, believed, that, angels, are, imperceptible, to, our, senses, but, they, may, choose, to, take, on, a, human, form, or, change, shape, he, taught, fideistic, concepts, such, as, the, later, philosophers, william, of, ockham, and, s, ren, kierkegaard, tertullian, was, drawn, to, montanism, mainly, because, of, its, strict, moral, standards, he, believed, that, the, church, had, forsaken, the, christian, way, of, life, and, entered, a, path, of, destruction, montanism, in, north, africa, seems, to, have, been, a, counter, reaction, against, secularism, the, form, of, montanism, in, north, africa, seems, to, have, differed, from, the, views, of, montanus, and, thus, the, north, african, montanists, believed, bishops, to, be, successors, of, the, apostles, the, new, testament, to, be, the, supreme, authority, on, christianity, and, they, did, not, deny, most, doctrines, of, the, church, tertullianists, were, a, group, mentioned, by, augustine, as, founded, by, tertullian, there, exists, differences, of, opinion, on, tertullianists, augustine, seems, to, have, believed, that, tertullian, soon, after, joining, the, montanists, started, his, own, sect, derived, from, montanism, while, some, scholars, believe, that, augustine, was, in, error, and, that, tertullianists, was, simply, an, alternative, name, of, north, african, montanism, and, not, a, separate, sect, tertullian, was, an, advocate, of, discipline, and, an, austere, code, of, practise, and, like, many, of, the, african, fathers, one, of, the, leading, representatives, of, the, rigorist, element, in, the, early, church, his, writings, on, public, amusements, the, veiling, of, virgins, the, conduct, of, women, and, the, like, reflect, these, opinions, his, views, may, have, led, him, to, adopt, montanism, with, its, ascetic, rigor, and, its, belief, in, chiliasm, and, the, continuance, of, the, prophetic, gifts, geoffrey, d, dunn, writes, that, some, of, tertullian, s, treatises, reveal, that, he, had, much, in, common, with, montanism, to, what, extent, if, at, all, this, meant, that, he, joined, a, group, that, was, schismatic, or, to, put, it, another, way, that, he, left, the, church, continues, to, be, debated, on, the, principle, that, we, should, not, look, at, or, listen, to, what, we, have, no, right, to, practise, and, that, polluted, things, seen, and, touched, pollute, de, spectaculis, viii, xvii, he, declared, a, christian, should, abstain, from, the, theatre, and, the, amphitheatre, there, pagan, religious, rites, were, applied, and, the, names, of, pagan, divinities, invoked, there, the, precepts, of, modesty, purity, and, humanity, were, ignored, or, set, aside, and, there, no, place, was, offered, to, the, onlookers, for, the, cultivation, of, the, christian, graces, women, should, put, aside, their, gold, and, precious, stones, as, ornaments, and, virgins, should, conform, to, the, law, of, st, paul, for, women, and, keep, themselves, strictly, veiled, de, virginibus, velandis, he, praised, the, unmarried, state, as, the,
