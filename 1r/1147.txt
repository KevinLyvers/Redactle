mieszko, i, polish, pronunciation, c, 930, 25, may, 992, was, duke, of, poland, from, 960, until, his, death, in, 992, and, the, founder, of, the, first, unified, polish, state, the, civitas, schinesghe, a, member, of, the, piast, dynasty, he, was, the, first, christian, ruler, of, poland, and, continued, the, policies, of, both, his, father, siemomys, and, grandfather, lestek, who, initiated, a, process, of, unification, among, the, polish, tribes, and, the, creation, of, statehood, according, to, existing, sources, mieszko, i, was, a, potent, politician, a, talented, military, leader, and, a, charismatic, ruler, through, both, alliances, and, military, force, he, extended, ongoing, polish, conquests, and, early, in, his, reign, subjugated, kuyavia, and, likely, gda, sk, pomerania, and, masovia, for, most, of, his, reign, mieszko, i, was, involved, in, warfare, for, the, control, of, western, pomerania, and, annexed, it, to, the, vicinity, of, the, lower, oder, river, his, internal, reforms, were, aimed, at, expanding, and, improving, the, so, called, war, monarchy, system, during, the, last, years, of, his, life, he, fought, the, bohemian, state, and, captured, silesia, and, lands, now, constituting, lesser, poland, in, foreign, policy, mieszko, i, placed, the, interests, of, his, country, foremost, and, entered, into, agreements, with, his, former, foes, he, successfully, used, diplomacy, by, concluding, alliances, with, bohemia, sweden, and, the, holy, roman, empire, mieszko, s, alliance, with, the, czech, prince, boleslaus, the, cruel, was, strengthened, by, his, marriage, in, 965, to, the, p, emyslid, princess, dobrawa, who, is, said, to, have, brought, the, christian, faith, mieszko, s, baptism, in, 966, placed, him, and, his, country, in, the, cultural, sphere, of, western, christianity, he, is, sometimes, called, the, clovis, of, poland, for, his, role, in, laying, the, foundations, for, a, christian, poland, on, his, death, he, left, to, his, son, and, successor, boles, aw, i, the, brave, a, country, with, greatly, expanded, territories, and, a, well, established, position, in, europe, mieszko, i, also, enigmatically, appeared, as, dagome, in, a, papal, document, dating, to, about, 1085, called, dagome, iudex, which, mentions, a, gift, or, dedication, of, mieszko, s, land, to, the, pope, almost, a, hundred, years, earlier, the, term, possibly, refers, to, mieszko, s, adopted, christian, name, dagobert, which, often, features, in, historical, writing, most, sources, also, identify, mieszko, i, as, the, father, of, sigrid, the, haughty, a, scandinavian, queen, the, grandfather, of, canute, the, great, and, the, great, grandfather, of, gunhilda, of, denmark, canute, the, great, s, daughter, and, wife, of, henry, iii, holy, roman, emperor, it, is, roughly, to, his, borders, that, poland, was, returned, in, 1945, there, is, no, certain, information, on, mieszko, s, life, before, he, took, control, over, his, lands, only, the, lesser, poland, chronicle, gives, the, date, of, his, birth, as, somewhere, between, the, years, 920, 931, depending, on, the, version, of, the, manuscript, however, modern, researchers, do, not, recognize, the, chronicle, as, a, reliable, source, several, historians, on, the, basis, of, their, investigations, postulated, the, date, of, mieszko, s, birth, to, have, been, between, 922, 945, the, activity, of, the, duke, in, his, final, years, of, life, puts, the, date, of, his, birth, closer, to, the, latter, year, mieszko, s, name, has, traditionally, been, thought, to, be, a, diminutive, of, mieczys, aw, but, this, is, refuted, by, the, majority, of, modern, historians, according, to, a, legend, first, described, by, gallus, anonymus, mieszko, was, blind, during, his, first, seven, years, of, life, this, typical, medieval, allegory, referred, to, his, paganism, rather, than, an, actual, disability, another, name, of, mieszko, dagome, appears, in, the, dagome, iudex, document, though, its, origin, is, uncertain, historians, speculate, that, it, was, derived, from, mieszko, s, adopted, christian, name, dagobert, or, an, abbreviation, of, the, two, names, dago, for, dagobert, and, me, for, mieszko, mieszko, i, took, over, the, rule, after, his, father, s, death, c, 950, 960, probably, closer, to, the, latter, date, due, to, the, lack, of, sources, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, exactly, which, lands, he, inherited, certainly, among, them, were, the, areas, inhabited, by, the, polans, and, goplans, as, well, as, the, sieradz, czyca, lands, and, kuyavia, it, is, possible, that, this, state, included, also, masovia, and, gda, sk, pomerania, soon, the, new, ruler, faced, the, task, of, integrating, the, relatively, large, ethnically, and, culturally, heterogeneous, territory, although, the, residents, of, areas, controlled, by, mieszko, spoke, mostly, one, language, had, similar, beliefs, and, reached, a, similar, level, of, economic, and, general, development, they, were, socially, connected, primarily, by, tribal, structures, it, appears, that, the, elders, cooperating, with, the, duke, first, felt, the, need, for, super, tribal, unity, as, expansion, allowed, them, to, broaden, their, influence, mieszko, and, his, people, were, described, around, 966, by, abraham, ben, jacob, a, sephardi, jewish, traveller, who, at, that, time, visited, the, prague, court, of, duke, boleslaus, i, the, cruel, abraham, presented, mieszko, i, as, one, of, the, four, slavic, kings, reigning, over, a, vast, northern, area, with, a, highly, regarded, and, substantial, military, force, at, his, disposal, more, precise, contemporary, records, regarding, mieszko, were, compiled, by, widukind, of, corvey, and, half, a, century, later, by, bishop, thietmar, of, merseburg, by, the, time, mieszko, i, took, over, from, his, father, the, polans, tribal, federation, of, greater, poland, had, for, some, time, been, actively, expanding, continuing, this, process, perhaps, in, the, first, years, of, mieszko, s, reign, if, it, had, not, been, done, already, by, his, father, mieszko, i, conquered, masovia, likely, also, during, that, period, or, earlier, at, least, part, of, gda, sk, pomerania, was, obtained, mieszko, s, interests, were, then, concentrated, mainly, on, areas, occupied, by, the, eastern, i, e, near, the, oder, river, branches, of, the, polabian, slavs, in, 963, margrave, gero, of, meissen, conquered, territories, occupied, by, the, polabian, lusatian, and, s, upian, tribes, and, as, a, result, came, into, direct, contact, with, the, polish, state, at, the, same, time, about, 960, mieszko, i, began, his, expansion, against, the, velunzani, and, lutici, tribes, the, war, was, recorded, by, the, traveller, abraham, ben, jacob, according, to, him, mieszko, i, had, fought, against, the, weltaba, tribe, commonly, identified, with, the, veleti, wichmann, the, younger, a, saxon, nobleman, who, was, then, a, leader, of, a, band, of, polabian, slavs, defeated, mieszko, twice, and, around, 963, a, brother, of, mieszko, whose, name, is, unknown, was, killed, in, the, fighting, the, frontiers, at, the, mouth, of, the, oder, river, were, also, desired, by, the, german, margraves, in, addition, the, veleti, bohemia, which, at, that, time, possessed, silesia, and, lesser, poland, regions, constituted, a, danger, for, the, young, state, of, the, polans, the, chronicle, of, thietmar, poses, some, problems, of, interpretation, of, the, information, regarding, the, attack, of, margrave, gero, on, the, slavic, tribes, as, a, result, of, which, he, purportedly, subordinated, to, the, authority, of, the, emperor, lusatia, and, the, selpuli, and, also, mieszko, with, his, subjects, according, to, the, majority, of, modern, historians, thietmar, made, an, error, summarizing, the, chronicle, of, widukind, placing, the, gero, raid, there, instead, of, the, fighting, that, mieszko, conducted, at, that, time, against, wichmann, the, younger, other, sources, make, no, mention, of, such, conquest, and, of, putting, the, polans, state, on, the, same, footing, with, the, polabian, slavs, on, the, other, hand, the, supporters, of, the, gero, s, invasion, theory, believe, that, the, margrave, did, actually, carry, out, a, successful, invasion, as, a, result, of, which, mieszko, i, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, the, emperor, and, also, was, compelled, to, adopt, catholicism, through, the, german, church, the, thesis, that, proposes, the, introduction, of, catholicism, as, a, result, of, this, war, finds, no, confirmation, in, german, sources, the, homage, is, then, a, separate, issue, since, according, to, the, chronicle, of, thietmar, mieszko, actually, paid, tribute, to, the, emperor, from, the, lands, usque, in, vurta, fluvium, up, to, the, warta, river, in, all, probability, mieszko, decided, to, pay, tribute, in, order, to, avoid, an, invasion, similar, to, the, one, that, lusatia, had, suffered, this, homage, would, take, place, in, 965, or, in, 966, at, the, latest, very, likely, the, tribute, applied, only, to, the, lubusz, land, which, was, in, the, german, sphere, of, influence, this, understanding, of, the, tribute, issue, explains, why, already, in, 967, mieszko, i, was, described, in, the, saxon, chronicles, as, the, emperor, s, friend, or, ally, supporter, latin, amicus, imperatoris, probably, in, 964, mieszko, began, negotiations, with, boleslaus, i, duke, of, bohemia, as, a, result, in, 965, mieszko, married, his, daughter, dobrawa, also, named, dobrava, doubravka, or, d, br, wka, this, political, polish, bohemian, alliance, is, likely, to, have, been, initiated, by, the, polish, ruler, it, is, probable, that, the, marriage, was, officially, arranged, in, february, 965, the, next, step, was, the, baptism, of, mieszko, there, are, different, hypotheses, concerning, this, event, most, often, it, is, assumed, that, it, was, a, political, decision, intended, to, bring, mieszko, s, state, closer, to, the, czechs, and, to, facilitate, his, activities, in, the, polabian, slavs, area, at, the, same, time, the, baptism, decreased, the, likelihood, of, future, attacks, by, german, margraves, and, deprived, them, of, the, opportunity, to, attempt, christianization, of, mieszko, s, lands, by, force, an, additional, reason, could, be, mieszko, s, desire, to, remove, from, power, the, influential, pagan, priest, class, which, may, have, been, blocking, his, efforts, to, establish, a, more, centralized, rule, a, different, hypothesis, is, linked, with, the, above, mentioned, acceptance, of, the, veracity, of, gero, s, invasion, of, poland, according, to, it, it, was, the, attack, of, the, margrave, that, forced, the, catholicization, which, was, to, be, an, act, of, subordination, to, the, emperor, done, without, the, mediation, of, the, pope, still, other, motives, were, responsible, according, to, gallus, anonymus, who, claimed, that, it, was, dobrawa, who, convinced, her, husband, to, change, his, religion, likewise, chronicler, thietmar, attributes, mieszko, s, conversion, to, dobrawa, s, influence, there, are, no, reasons, to, negate, dobrawa, s, role, in, mieszko, s, acceptance, of, roman, catholicism, however, crediting, rulers, wives, with, positive, influence, over, their, husbands, actions, was, a, common, convention, at, that, time, it, is, generally, recognized, that, the, baptism, of, mieszko, i, took, place, in, 966, the, place, is, unknown, it, could, have, had, happened, in, any, of, the, cities, of, the, empire, possibly, regensburg, but, also, in, one, of, the, polish, towns, like, gniezno, or, ostr, w, lednicki, the, belief, that, the, baptism, was, accomplished, through, the, czechs, in, order, to, avoid, the, dependence, on, germany, and, the, german, church, is, incorrect, because, bohemia, would, not, have, its, own, church, organization, until, 973, at, the, time, of, the, baptism, of, mieszko, the, existing, bohemian, church, establishment, was, a, part, of, the, regensburg, diocese, thus, if, the, polish, ruler, accepted, the, baptism, through, prague, s, mediation, it, had, to, be, sanctioned, in, regensburg, however, the, religious, vocabulary, words, like, baptism, sermon, prayer, church, apostle, bishop, or, confirmation, were, adopted, from, the, czech, language, and, had, to, come, from, dobrawa, s, entourage, and, the, church, elements, that, arrived, with, her, perhaps, with, her, also, came, the, first, polish, bishop, jordan, it, could, be, that, the, reason, for, the, czech, preference, of, mieszko, was, the, existence, in, bohemia, of, a, mission, which, followed, the, precepts, of, the, byzantine, greek, brothers, and, later, saints, cyril, and, methodius, who, developed, and, performed, the, liturgy, in, the, slavic, rite, more, readily, understood, by, mieszko, and, his, subjects, the, slavic, rite, church, branch, had, survived, in, bohemia, for, another, hundred, years, after, mieszko, s, baptism, after, the, normalization, of, relations, with, the, holy, roman, empire, and, bohemia, mieszko, i, returned, to, his, plans, to, conquer, the, western, part, of, pomerania, on, 21, september, 967, the, polish, bohemian, troops, prevailed, in, the, decisive, battle, against, the, wolinians, led, by, wichmann, the, younger, which, gave, mieszko, control, over, the, mouth, of, the, odra, river, the, german, margraves, had, not, opposed, mieszko, s, activities, in, pomerania, perhaps, even, supported, them, the, death, of, the, rebellious, wichmann, who, succumbed, to, his, wounds, soon, after, the, battle, may, have, been, in, line, with, their, interests, a, telling, incident, took, place, after, the, battle, a, testimony, to, mieszko, s, high, standing, among, the, empire, s, dignitaries, just, one, year, after, his, baptism, widukind, of, corvey, reported, that, the, dying, wichmann, asked, mieszko, to, hand, over, wichmann, s, weapons, to, emperor, otto, i, to, whom, wichmann, was, related, for, mieszko, the, victory, had, to, be, a, satisfying, experience, especially, in, light, of, his, past, defeats, inflicted, by, wichmann, the, exact, result, of, mieszko, s, fighting, in, the, west, of, pomerania, is, not, known, subsequent, loss, of, the, region, by, mieszko, s, son, boles, aw, suggests, that, the, conquest, was, difficult, and, the, hold, over, that, territory, rather, tenuous, in, one, version, of, the, legend, of, saint, adalbert, of, prague, known, in, polish, as, wojciech, it, is, written, that, mieszko, i, had, his, daughter, married, to, a, pomeranian, prince, who, previously, voluntarily, was, washed, with, the, holy, water, of, the, baptism, in, poland, the, above, information, as, well, as, the, fact, that, boles, aw, lost, western, pomerania, suggest, that, the, region, was, not, truly, incorporated, into, the, polish, state, but, only, became, a, fief, this, conjecture, seems, to, be, confirmed, in, the, introduction, of, the, first, volume, of, the, chronicles, of, gallus, anonymus, concerning, the, pomeranians, although, often, the, leaders, of, the, forces, defeated, by, the, polish, duke, sought, salvation, in, baptism, as, soon, as, they, regained, their, strength, they, repudiated, the, christian, faith, and, started, the, war, against, christian, anew, in, 972, poland, was, attacked, by, odo, i, margrave, of, the, saxon, ostmark, according, to, the, chronicles, of, thietmar, odo, acted, unilaterally, without, the, emperor, s, consent, meanwhile, the, noble, margrave, hodo, having, collected, his, army, attacked, mieszko, who, has, been, faithfully, paying, tribute, to, the, emperor, for, the, lands, up, the, warta, river, there, are, different, hypotheses, concerning, the, reasons, for, this, invasion, possibly, margrave, odo, wanted, to, stop, the, growing, power, of, the, polish, state, very, likely, odo, wanted, to, protect, the, wolinian, state, which, he, considered, his, zone, of, influence, from, the, polish, take, over, possibly, the, wolinians, themselves, called, the, margrave, and, asked, his, help, in, any, event, odo, s, forces, moved, in, and, on, 24, june, 972, twice, engaged, mieszko, s, army, at, the, village, of, cidini, commonly, identified, with, cedynia, at, first, the, margrave, defeated, mieszko, s, forces, subsequently, the, duke, s, brother, czcibor, defeated, the, germans, in, the, decisive, stage, inflicting, great, losses, among, their, troops, it, may, be, that, mieszko, intentionally, staged, the, retreat, which, was, followed, by, a, surprise, attack, on, the, flank, of, the, german, pursuing, troops, after, this, battle, mieszko, and, odo, were, called, to, the, imperial, diet, in, quedlinburg, in, 973, to, explain, and, justify, their, conduct, the, exact, judgment, of, the, emperor, is, unknown, but, it, is, certain, that, the, sentence, was, not, carried, out, because, he, died, a, few, weeks, after, the, diet, it, is, commonly, assumed, that, the, sentence, was, unfavorable, to, the, polish, ruler, the, annals, of, altaich, indicates, that, mieszko, was, not, present, in, quedlinburg, during, the, gathering, instead, he, had, to, send, his, son, boles, aw, as, a, hostage, mieszko, s, conflict, with, odo, i, was, a, surprising, event, because, according, to, thietmar, mieszko, respected, the, margrave, highly, thietmar, wrote, that, mieszko, would, never, wear, his, outdoor, garment, in, a, house, where, odo, was, present, or, remain, seated, after, odo, had, gotten, up, it, is, believed, that, in, practical, terms, the, victory, at, cedynia, sealed, western, pomerania, s, fate, as, mieszko, s, dependency, according, to, archaeological, research, during, the, 970s, the, sandomierz, region, and, the, przemy, l, area, inhabited, by, the, lendians, became, incorporated, into, the, polish, state, none, of, it, is, certain, for, the, lack, of, written, sources, it, is, possible, that, especially, the, przemy, l, area, also, inhabited, the, white, croats, belonged, at, that, time, to, bohemia, which, supposedly, extended, up, to, the, bug, river, and, styr, river, the, primary, chronicle, states, that, in, 981, vladimir, of, the, rurik, dynasty, went, towards, the, lachy, and, took, their, towns, przemy, l, czerwie, and, other, strongholds, the, exact, interpretation, of, this, passage, is, uncertain, because, the, ruthenian, word, lachy, meant, both, the, poles, in, general, and, the, southeastern, lendians, mieszko, s, conquest, of, sandomierz, could, also, have, taken, place, later, together, with, the, takeover, of, the, vistulans, western, and, central, lesser, poland, however, widukind, in, the, 10th, century, mentions, mieszko, ruled, over, the, sclavi, tribe, of, licicaviki, which, is, identified, with, the, lendians, some, historians, suggest, that, the, regions, of, sandomierz, lublin, and, czerwie, western, red, ruthenia, were, indeed, annexed, by, mieszko, s, state, in, the, 970s, as, lands, valuable, for, trade, reasons, and, as, a, starting, point, for, a, future, attack, against, what, was, to, become, lesser, poland, then, in, the, hands, of, bohemia, sandomierz, under, this, scenario, was, the, central, hub, of, the, area, with, czerwie, przemy, l, and, che, m, assuming, the, function, of, defensive, borderland, strongholds, after, the, death, of, emperor, otto, i, in, 973, mieszko, like, his, brother, in, law, duke, boleslaus, ii, of, bohemia, joined, the, german, opposition, in, support, of, the, attempted, imperial, succession, of, henry, ii, duke, of, bavaria, mieszko, may, have, been, motivated, by, revenge, because, of, the, presumably, negative, verdict, of, the, quedlinburg, summit, but, more, importantly, he, may, have, wanted, more, favorable, terms, for, his, cooperation, with, germany, the, participation, of, mieszko, in, the, conspiracy, against, otto, ii, was, documented, in, only, one, source, the, chronicles, of, the, monastery, in, altaich, in, its, entry, for, the, year, 974, the, duke, of, bavaria, was, defeated, and, emperor, otto, ii, regained, full, power, shortly, afterwards, the, young, emperor, waged, a, retaliatory, expedition, against, bohemia, in, 978, forcing, duke, boleslaus, into, submission, in, 977, mieszko, s, wife, dobrawa, died, at, first, there, were, no, apparent, repercussions, as, the, polish, ruler, had, maintained, his, alliance, with, bohemia, in, 979, otto, ii, supposedly, attacked, poland, mention, of, this, event, can, be, found, in, the, chronicle, of, the, bishops, of, cambrai, from, the, 11th, century, the, effects, of, this, expedition, are, unknown, but, it, is, suspected, that, the, emperor, did, not, succeed, due, to, bad, weather, the, emperor, was, back, at, the, border, of, thuringia, and, saxony, in, december, of, that, year, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, invasion, actually, took, place, the, chronicle, only, stated, that, it, was, an, expedition, against, the, slavs, archaeological, discoveries, appear, to, support, the, thesis, of, otto, s, invasion, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 10th, century, there, had, been, a, radical, expansion, of, the, fortifications, at, gniezno, and, ostr, w, lednicki, which, may, be, associated, with, the, polish, german, war, or, the, expectation, of, such, the, duration, of, the, expedition, suggests, that, it, may, have, reached, as, far, east, as, the, vicinity, of, pozna, the, polish, german, agreement, was, concluded, in, the, spring, or, possibly, summer, of, 980, because, in, november, of, that, year, otto, ii, left, his, country, and, went, to, italy, it, appears, that, during, this, time, mieszko, i, married, oda, daughter, of, dietrich, of, haldensleben, margrave, of, the, northern, march, after, abducting, her, from, the, monastery, of, kalbe, chronicler, thietmar, described, the, event, as, follows, although, thietmar, made, no, mention, of, warfare, that, possibly, took, place, on, this, occasion, the, information, on, the, return, of, the, accord, acting, for, the, good, of, the, country, and, release, of, prisoners, indicate, that, a, conflict, actually, did, occur, the, marriage, with, oda, considerably, affected, the, position, and, prestige, of, mieszko, who, entered, the, world, of, saxon, aristocracy, as, a, son, in, law, of, margrave, dietrich, he, gained, an, ally, in, one, of, the, most, influential, politicians, of, the, holy, roman, empire, as, the, margrave, was, a, distant, relative, of, the, emperor, mieszko, became, a, member, of, the, circle, connected, to, the, imperial, ruling, house, probably, in, the, early, 980s, mieszko, allied, his, country, with, sweden, against, denmark, the, alliance, was, sealed, with, the, marriage, of, mieszko, s, daughter, wi, tos, awa, with, the, swedish, king, erik, the, content, of, the, treaty, is, known, from, the, traditional, account, not, entirely, reliable, but, originating, directly, from, the, danish, court, given, by, adam, of, bremen, in, this, text, probably, as, a, result, of, confusion, he, gives, instead, of, mieszko, s, name, the, name, of, his, son, boles, aw, mieszko, decided, on, the, alliance, with, sweden, probably, in, order, to, help, protect, his, possessions, in, pomerania, from, the, danish, king, harald, bluetooth, and, his, son, sweyn, they, may, have, acted, in, cooperation, with, the, wolinian, autonomous, entity, the, danish, were, defeated, c, 991, and, their, ruler, was, expelled, the, dynastic, alliance, with, sweden, had, probably, affected, the, equipment, and, composition, of, mieszko, s, troops, perhaps, at, that, time, the, varangian, warriors, were, recruited, their, presence, is, indicated, by, archaeological, excavations, in, the, vicinity, of, pozna, in, 982, emperor, otto, ii, suffered, a, disastrous, defeat, against, the, emirate, of, sicily, the, resulting, weakness, of, the, imperial, power, was, exploited, by, the, lutici, who, initiated, a, great, uprising, of, the, polabian, slavs, in, 983, german, authority, in, the, area, ceased, to, exist, and, the, polabian, tribes, began, to, threaten, the, empire, the, death, of, otto, ii, at, the, end, of, that, year, contributed, further, to, the, unrest, ultimately, the, lutici, and, the, obotrites, were, able, to, liberate, themselves, from, german, rule, for, the, next, two, centuries, the, emperor, left, a, minor, successor, otto, iii, his, regency, was, claimed, by, henry, ii, of, bavaria, like, in, 973, mieszko, and, the, czech, duke, boleslaus, ii, took, the, side, of, the, bavarian, duke, this, fact, is, confirmed, in, the, chronicle, of, thietmar, which, noted, that, there, arrived, also, among, many, other, princes, mieszko, m, ciwoj, and, boleslaus, and, promised, to, support, him, under, oath, as, the, king, and, ruler, in, 984, the, czechs, took, over, meissen, but, in, the, same, year, henry, ii, gave, up, his, pretension, to, the, german, throne, the, role, played, by, mieszko, i, in, the, subsequent, struggles, is, unclear, because, the, contemporary, sources, are, scarce, and, not, in, agreement, probably, in, 985, the, polish, ruler, ended, his, support, for, the, bavarian, duke, and, moved, to, the, side, of, the, emperor, it, is, believed, that, mieszko, s, motivation, was, the, threat, posed, to, his, interests, by, the, polabian, slavs, uprising, the, upheaval, was, a, problem, for, both, poland, and, germany, but, not, for, bohemia, in, the, chronicle, of, hildesheim, in, the, entry, for, the, year, 985, it, is, noted, that, mieszko, came, to, help, the, saxons, in, their, fight, against, some, slavic, forces, presumably, the, polabians, one, year, later, the, polish, ruler, had, a, personal, meeting, with, the, emperor, an, event, mentioned, in, the, annals, of, hersfeld, which, reported, that, otto, the, boy, king, ravaged, bohemia, but, received, mieszko, who, arrived, with, gifts, according, to, thietmar, and, other, contemporary, chronicles, the, gift, given, by, mieszko, to, the, emperor, was, a, camel, the, meeting, cemented, the, polish, german, alliance, with, mieszko, joining, otto, s, expedition, against, a, slavic, land, which, together, they, wholly, devastated, with, fire, and, tremendous, depopulation, it, is, not, clear, which, slavic, territory, was, invaded, perhaps, another, raid, against, the, polabians, took, place, however, there, are, indications, that, it, was, an, expedition, against, the, czechs, mieszko, s, first, against, his, southern, neighbors, possibly, on, this, occasion, the, duke, of, the, polans, accomplished, the, most, significant, expansion, of, his, state, the, takeover, of, lesser, poland, thietmar, s, narrative, however, raises, doubts, as, to, whether, the, joined, military, operation, actually, happened, the, chronicler, claims, that, a, settlement, was, then, concluded, between, the, emperor, and, the, bohemian, ruler, boleslaus, ii, the, pious, which, is, not, mentioned, in, any, other, source, and, is, contrary, to, the, realities, of, the, political, situation, at, that, time, another, debatable, point, is, thietmar, s, claim, that, mieszko, subordinated, himself, to, the, king, most, historians, believe, that, it, was, only, a, matter, of, recognition, of, otto, s, royal, authority, some, suggest, that, a, fealty, relationship, could, have, been, involved, whether, or, not, the, german, polish, invasion, of, bohemia, actually, happened, the, friendly, relations, between, the, czechs, and, the, poles, came, to, an, end, bohemia, resumed, its, earlier, alliance, with, the, lutici, which, in, 990, resulted, in, a, war, with, mieszko, who, was, supported, by, empress, theophanu, duke, boleslaus, ii, was, probably, the, first, one, to, attack, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, silesia, was, taken, over, by, poland, however, the, annexation, of, silesia, possibly, took, place, around, 985, because, during, this, year, the, major, piast, strongholds, in, wroc, aw, opole, and, g, og, w, were, already, being, built, the, issue, of, the, incorporation, of, lesser, poland, is, also, not, completely, resolved, possibly, mieszko, took, the, region, before, 990, which, is, indicated, by, the, vague, remark, of, thietmar, who, wrote, of, a, country, taken, by, mieszko, from, boleslaus, in, light, of, this, theory, the, conquest, of, lesser, poland, could, be, a, reason, for, the, war, or, its, first, stage, many, historians, suggested, that, the, czech, rule, over, lesser, poland, was, only, nominal, and, likely, limited, to, the, indirect, control, of, krak, w, and, perhaps, a, few, other, important, centers, this, theory, is, based, on, the, lack, of, archaeological, discoveries, which, would, indicate, major, building, investments, undertaken, by, the, bohemian, state, after, its, incorporation, lesser, poland, supposedly, became, the, part, of, the, country, assigned, to, mieszko, s, oldest, son, boles, aw, which, is, indirectly, indicated, in, the, chronicle, of, thietmar, some, historians, on, the, basis, of, the, chronicle, of, cosmas, of, prague, believe, that, the, conquest, of, the, lands, around, the, lower, vistula, river, took, place, after, mieszko, s, death, specifically, in, 999, there, is, also, a, theory, according, to, which, during, this, transition, period, lesser, poland, was, governed, by, boles, aw, whose, authority, was, granted, to, him, by, the, bohemian, duke, at, the, end, of, his, life, c, 991, 992, mieszko, i, together, with, his, wife, oda, and, their, sons, issued, a, document, called, dagome, iudex, where, the, polish, ruler, placed, his, lands, under, the, protection, of, the, pope, and, described, their, borders, only, a, later, imprecise, summary, of, the, document, has, been, preserved, there, are, two, main, theories, concerning, reasons, behind, the, issuing, of, dagome, iudex, dagome, iudex, is, of, capital, importance, for, polish, history, because, it, gives, a, general, description, of, the, polish, state, s, geographical, location, at, the, end, of, mieszko, s, reign, during, his, last, years, of, life, mieszko, remained, loyal, to, the, alliance, with, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 991, he, arrived, at, a, gathering, in, quedlinburg, where, he, participated, in, the, customary, exchange, of, gifts, with, otto, iii, and, empress, theophanu, in, the, same, year, he, took, part, in, a, joint, expedition, with, the, young, king, to, brandenburg, mieszko, died, on, 25, may, 992, sources, give, no, reasons, to, believe, that, his, death, occurred, from, causes, other, than, natural, according, to, thietmar, the, polish, ruler, died, in, an, old, age, overcame, with, fever, probably, he, was, buried, in, the, pozna, cathedral, the, remains, of, the, first, historical, ruler, of, poland, have, never, been, found, and, the, place, of, his, burial, is, not, known, with, certainty, in, 1836, 1837, a, cenotaph, was, built, for, mieszko, i, and, his, successor, boles, aw, i, the, brave, in, the, golden, chapel, polish, z, ota, kaplica, at, the, pozna, cathedral, where, the, damaged, remains, found, in, the, 14th, century, tomb, of, boles, aw, were, placed, according, to, thietmar, mieszko, i, divided, his, state, before, his, death, among, a, number, of, princes, they, were, probably, his, sons, boles, aw, i, the, brave, mieszko, and, lambert, in, 1999, the, archeologist, hanna, k, ka, krenz, located, what, s, left, of, mieszko, s, palace, chapel, complex, in, pozna, mieszko, is, chiefly, credited, with, the, unification, of, polish, lands, his, state, was, the, first, state, that, could, be, called, poland, he, is, often, considered, the, founder, the, principal, creator, and, builder, of, the, polish, state, his, acceptance, of, roman, catholicism, led, to, the, inclusion, of, poland, in, the, mainstream, civilization, and, political, structures, of, roman, catholic, europe, he, sponsored, the, erection, of, churches, the, gniezno, cathedral, was, constructed, during, mieszko, s, rule, it, is, very, likely, the, duke, also, founded, the, church, at, ostr, w, tumski, and, the, pozna, cathedral, possibly, during, mieszko, s, reign, poland, began, minting, its, own, coin, the, denarius, though, according, to, s, suchodolski, the, monetary, system, was, installed, by, mieszko, s, grandson, and, namesake, mieszko, ii, lambert, at, the, end, of, his, rule, mieszko, i, left, to, his, sons, a, territory, at, least, twice, as, large, as, what, he, inherited, from, his, father, the, most, significant, were, the, additions, of, silesia, western, pomerania, and, probably, lesser, poland, including, krak, w, he, was, the, first, ruler, to, conduct, efficient, foreign, policy, which, included, agreements, with, germany, bohemia, and, sweden, and, prudently, used, his, military, resources, mieszko, is, featured, on, the, obverse, of, the, 10, polish, z, oty, banknote, according, to, gallus, anonymus, before, becoming, a, christian, mieszko, had, seven, pagan, wives, whom, he, was, required, to, relinquish, leaving, dobrawa, as, his, only, spouse, nothing, is, known, of, the, fates, of, any, possible, children, from, these, relationships, in, 965, before, his, baptism, mieszko, married, dobrawa, of, bohemia, b, 940, 45, d, 977, they, had, two, children, according, to, one, hypothesis, there, was, another, daughter, of, mieszko, married, to, a, pomeranian, slavic, prince, she, could, be, a, daughter, of, dobrawa, or, of, one, of, the, previous, pagan, wives, according, to, one, theory, this, unnamed, daughter, of, mieszko, i, and, her, pomeranian, husband, were, the, parents, of, zemuzil, duke, of, pomerania, also, a, theory, exists, apparently, based, on, thietmar, and, supported, by, oswald, balzer, in, 1895, that, vladivoj, who, ruled, as, duke, of, bohemia, in, 1002, 1003, was, a, son, of, mieszko, and, dobrawa, although, most, modern, historians, reject, this, claim, bohemian, historiography, supported, the, piast, parentage, of, vladivoj, in, 978, 79, mieszko, married, oda, of, haldensleben, b, 955, 60, d, 1023, daughter, of, dietrich, of, haldensleben, margrave, of, the, northern, march, she, was, abducted, by, her, future, husband, from, the, monastery, of, kalbe, they, had, three, sons, after, a, struggle, for, power, between, boles, aw, i, and, oda, with, her, minor, sons, boles, aw, s, half, brothers, the, eldest, son, of, mieszko, i, took, control, over, all, of, his, father, s, state, and, expelled, his, stepmother, and, her, sons, from, poland
