xi, leading, some, authorities, to, maintain, that, he, was, a, metaphysical, monist, and, others, to, maintain, that, he, was, a, metaphysical, dualist, according, to, zhu, xi, s, theory, every, physical, object, and, every, person, has, its, li, and, therefore, has, contact, in, its, metaphysical, core, with, the, taiji, what, is, referred, to, as, the, human, soul, mind, or, spirit, is, understood, as, the, taiji, or, the, supreme, creative, principle, as, it, works, its, way, out, in, a, person, qi, and, li, operate, together, in, mutual, dependence, they, are, mutually, aspective, in, all, creatures, in, the, universe, these, two, aspects, are, manifested, in, the, creation, of, substantial, entities, when, their, activity, is, waxing, rapid, or, expansive, that, is, the, yang,

zhu, xi, argues, that, li, existed, even, before, heaven, and, earth, in, terms, of, li, and, qi, zhu, xi, s, system, strongly, resembles, buddhist, ideas, of, li, principle, and, shi, affairs, matters, though, zhu, xi, and, his, followers, strongly, argued, that, they, were, not, copying, buddhist, ideas, instead, they, held, they, were, using, concepts, already, present, long, before, in, the, i, ching, zhu, xi, discussed, how, he, saw, the, supreme, ultimate, concept, to, be, compatible, with, principle, of, taoism, but, his, concept, of, taiji, was, different, from, the, understanding, of, tao, in, daoism, where, taiji, is, a, differentiating, principle, that, results, in, the, emergence, of, something, new, dao, is, still, and, silent, operating, to, reduce, all, things, to, equality, and, indistinguishability, he, argued, that, there, is, a, central, harmony, that, is, not, static, or, empty, but, was, dynamic, and, that, the, supreme, ultimate, is, itself, in, constant, creative, activity, zhu, xi, considered, the, earlier, confucian, xunzi, to, be, a, heretic, for, departing, from, mengzi, s, idea, of, innate, human, goodness, even, if, people, displayed, immoral, behaviour, the, supreme, regulative, principle, was, good, the, cause, of, immoral, actions, is, qi, zhu, xi, s, metaphysics, is, that, everything, contains, li, and, qi, li, is, the, principle, that, is, in, everything, and, governs, the, universe, each, person, has, a, perfect, li, as, such, individuals, should, act, in, perfect, accordance, with, morality, however, while, li, is, the, underlying, structure, qi, is, also, part, of, everything, qi, obscures, our, perfect, moral, nature, the, task, of, moral, cultivation, is, to, clear, our, qi, if, our, qi, is, clear, and, balanced, then, we, will, act, in, a, perfectly, moral, way, heart, and, mind, are, both, expressed, in, chinese, with, the, same, word, xin, clarity, of, mind, and, purity, of, heart, are, ideal, in, confucian, philosophy, in, the, following, poem, reflections, while, reading, 1, zhu, xi, illustrates, this, concept, by, comparing, the, mind, to, a, mirror, left, covered, until, needed, that, simply, reflects, the, world, around, it, staying, clear, by, the, flowing, waters, symbolizing, the, tao, in, chinese, the, mind, was, sometimes, called, the, square, inch, which, is, the, literal, translation, of, the, term, alluded, to, in, the, beginning, of, the, poem, a, small, square, pond, an, uncovered, mirror, where, sunlight, and, clouds, linger, and, leave, i, asked, how, it, stays, so, clear, it, said, spring, water, keeps, flowing, in, according, to, zhu, xi, s, epistemology, knowledge, and, action, were, indivisible, components, of, truly, intelligent, activity, although, he, did, distinguish, between, the, priority, of, knowing, since, intelligent, action, requires, forethought, and, the, importance, of, action, as, it, produces, a, discernible, effect, zhu, xi, said, knowledge, and, action, always, require, each, other, it, is, like, a, person, who, cannot, walk, without, legs, although, he, has, eyes, and, who, cannot, see, without, eyes, although, he, has, legs, with, respect, to, order, knowledge, comes, first, and, with, respect, to, importance, action, is, more, important, zhu, xi, advocated, the, investigation, of, things, gewu, zhizhi, how, to, investigate, and, what, these, things, are, is, the, source, of, much, debate, to, zhu, xi, the, things, are, moral, principles, and, the, investigation, involves, paying, attention, to, everything, in, both, books, and, affairs, because, moral, principles, are, quite, inexhaustible, zhu, xi, did, believe, in, the, existence, of, spirits, ghosts, divination, and, blessings, zhu, xi, practiced, a, form, of, daily, meditation, called, jingzuo, similar, to, but, not, the, same, as, buddhist, dhyana, or, chan, ding, wade, giles, ch, an, ting, his, meditation, did, not, require, the, cessation, of, all, thinking, as, in, some, forms, of, buddhism, rather, it, was, characterised, by, quiet, introspection, that, helped, to, balance, various, aspects, of, one, s, personality, and, allowed, for, focused, thought, and, concentration, his, form, of, meditation, was, by, nature, confucian, in, the, sense, that, it, was, concerned, with, morality, his, meditation, attempted, to, reason, and, feel, in, harmony, with, the, universe, he, believed, that, this, type, of, meditation, brought, humanity, closer, together, and, more, into, harmony, zhu, xi, heavily, focused, his, energy, on, teaching, claiming, that, learning, is, the, only, way, to, sage, hood, he, wished, to, make, the, pursuit, of, sage, hood, attainable, to, all, men, he, lamented, more, modern, printing, techniques, and, the, proliferation, of, books, that, ensued, this, he, believed, made, students, less, appreciative, and, focused, on, books, simply, because, there, were, more, books, to, read, than, before, therefore, he, attempted, to, redefine, how, students, should, learn, and, read, in, fact, disappointed, by, local, schools, in, china, he, established, his, own, academy, white, deer, grotto, academy, to, instruct, students, properly, and, in, the, proper, fashion, zhu, xi, wrote, what, was, to, become, the, orthodox, confucian, interpretation, of, a, number, of, concepts, in, taoism, and, buddhism, while, he, appeared, to, have, adopted, some, ideas, from, these, competing, systems, of, thought, unlike, previous, neo, confucians, he, strictly, abided, by, the, confucian, doctrine, of, active, moral, cultivation, he, found, buddhist, principles, to, be, darkening, and, deluding, the, original, mind, as, well, as, destroying, human, relations, from, 1313, to, 1905, zhu, xi, s, commentaries, on, the, four, books, formed, the, basis, of, civil, service, examinations, in, china, his, teachings, were, to, dominate, neo, confucians, such, as, wang, fuzhi, though, dissenters, would, later, emerge, such, as, wang, yangming, and, the, school, of, mind, two, and, a, half, centuries, later, his, philosophy, survived, the, intellectual, revolution, of, 1917, and, later, feng, youlan, would, interpret, his, conception, of, li, qi, and, taiji, into, a, new, metaphysical, theory, he, was, also, influential, in, japan, known, as, shushigaku, school, of, master,

and, the, running, cursive, script, of, yan, zhenqing, though, his, manuscripts, left, to, the, world, are, piecemeal, and, incomplete, and, most, of, his, works, are, lost, moreover, his, fame, in, the, realm, of, philosophy, was, so, great, that, even, his, brilliance, in, calligraphy, was, overshadowed, he, was, skillful, in, both, running, and, cursive, scripts, especially, in, large,

to, be, observed, for, each, word, there, should, be, room, for, tolerance, multiplicity, and, naturalness, in, other, words, calligraphy, had, to, observe, rules, and, at, the, same, time, not, be, bound, by, them, so, as, to, express, the, quality, of, naturalness, it, is, small, wonder, that, his, calligraphy, had, been, highly, esteemed, throughout, the, centuries, by, great, personages, as,
