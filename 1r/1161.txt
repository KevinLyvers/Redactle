henry, ii, 1133, march, 05, 1189, july, 06, 5, march, 1133, 6, july, 1189, also, known, as, henry, fitzempress, and, henry, curtmantle, was, king, of, england, from, 1154, until, his, death, in, 1189, during, his, reign, he, controlled, england, substantial, parts, of, wales, and, ireland, and, much, of, france, including, normandy, anjou, and, aquitaine, an, area, that, altogether, was, later, called, the, angevin, empire, and, also, held, power, over, scotland, and, the, duchy, of, brittany, henry, became, politically, and, militarily, involved, by, the, age, of, fourteen, in, the, efforts, of, his, mother, matilda, daughter, of, henry, i, of, england, to, claim, the, english, throne, at, that, time, held, by, matilda, s, cousin, stephen, of, blois, henry, s, father, geoffrey, made, him, duke, of, normandy, in, 1150, and, upon, geoffrey, s, death, in, 1151, henry, inherited, anjou, maine, and, touraine, his, marriage, to, eleanor, of, aquitaine, brought, him, control, of, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, thus, he, controlled, most, of, france, henry, s, military, expedition, to, england, in, 1153, resulted, in, king, stephen, agreeing, by, the, treaty, of, wallingford, to, leave, england, to, henry, and, he, inherited, the, kingdom, at, stephen, s, death, a, year, later, henry, was, an, energetic, and, ruthless, ruler, driven, by, a, desire, to, restore, the, royal, lands, and, prerogatives, of, his, grandfather, henry, i, during, the, early, years, of, his, reign, henry, restored, the, royal, administration, in, england, which, had, almost, collapsed, during, stephen, s, reign, and, re, established, hegemony, over, wales, henry, s, desire, to, control, the, english, church, led, to, conflict, with, his, former, friend, thomas, becket, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, this, controversy, lasted, for, much, of, the, 1160s, and, resulted, in, becket, s, murder, in, 1170, soon, after, his, accession, henry, came, into, conflict, with, louis, vii, of, france, his, feudal, overlord, and, the, two, rulers, fought, over, several, decades, what, has, been, termed, a, cold, war, henry, expanded, his, empire, at, louis, s, expense, taking, brittany, and, pushing, east, into, central, france, and, south, into, toulouse, despite, numerous, peace, conferences, and, treaties, no, lasting, agreement, was, reached, henry, and, eleanor, had, eight, children, three, of, their, sons, would, rule, as, king, though, henry, the, young, king, only, as, co, ruler, rather, than, sole, monarch, as, he, predeceased, his, father, as, his, sons, grew, up, henry, struggled, to, find, ways, to, satisfy, their, desires, for, land, and, immediate, power, and, tensions, rose, over, the, future, inheritance, of, the, empire, encouraged, by, louis, vii, and, his, son, philip, ii, who, ascended, to, the, french, throne, in, 1180, in, 1173, henry, s, heir, apparent, young, henry, rebelled, against, his, father, he, was, joined, by, his, brothers, richard, and, geoffrey, and, by, their, mother, several, european, states, allied, themselves, with, the, rebels, and, the, great, revolt, was, only, defeated, by, henry, s, vigorous, military, action, and, talented, local, commanders, many, of, them, new, men, appointed, for, their, loyalty, and, administrative, skills, young, henry, and, geoffrey, led, another, revolt, in, 1183, during, which, young, henry, died, of, dysentery, geoffrey, died, in, 1186, the, anglo, norman, invasion, of, ireland, provided, lands, for, henry, s, youngest, son, john, by, 1189, philip, swayed, richard, to, his, side, leading, to, a, final, rebellion, decisively, defeated, by, philip, and, richard, and, suffering, from, a, bleeding, ulcer, henry, retreated, to, chinon, castle, in, anjou, he, died, soon, afterwards, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, richard, i, henry, s, empire, quickly, collapsed, during, the, reign, of, his, son, john, who, succeeded, richard, in, 1199, but, many, of, the, changes, henry, introduced, during, his, lengthy, rule, had, long, term, consequences, henry, s, legal, changes, are, generally, considered, to, have, laid, the, basis, for, the, english, common, law, while, his, intervention, in, brittany, wales, ireland, and, scotland, shaped, the, development, of, their, societies, histories, and, governmental, systems, historical, interpretations, of, henry, s, reign, have, changed, considerably, over, time, contemporary, chroniclers, such, as, gerald, of, wales, and, william, of, newburgh, though, sometimes, unfavourable, generally, laud, his, achievements, in, the, 18th, century, scholars, argued, that, henry, was, a, driving, force, in, the, creation, of, a, genuinely, english, monarchy, and, ultimately, a, unified, britain, during, the, victorian, expansion, of, the, british, empire, historians, were, keenly, interested, in, the, formation, of, henry, s, own, empire, but, they, also, criticised, certain, aspects, of, his, private, life, and, treatment, of, becket, henry, was, born, in, maine, at, le, mans, on, 5, march, 1133, the, eldest, child, of, the, empress, matilda, and, her, second, husband, geoffrey, plantagenet, count, of, anjou, the, french, county, of, anjou, was, formed, in, the, 10th, century, and, its, angevin, rulers, attempted, for, several, centuries, to, extend, their, influence, and, power, across, france, through, careful, marriages, and, political, alliances, in, theory, the, county, answered, to, the, french, king, but, royal, power, over, anjou, weakened, during, the, 11th, century, and, the, county, became, largely, autonomous, henry, s, mother, was, the, legitimate, daughter, of, henry, i, king, of, england, and, duke, of, normandy, she, was, born, into, a, powerful, ruling, class, of, normans, who, traditionally, owned, extensive, estates, in, both, england, and, normandy, and, her, first, husband, had, been, holy, roman, emperor, henry, v, henry, i, had, during, his, own, lifetime, obtained, pledges, of, fealty, from, his, nobility, including, from, his, nephew, stephen, of, blois, promising, to, support, matilda, s, claim, to, the, throne, after, her, father, s, death, in, 1135, matilda, hoped, to, claim, the, english, throne, but, instead, stephen, was, crowned, king, and, recognised, as, the, duke, of, normandy, resulting, in, a, civil, war, between, their, rival, supporters, geoffrey, took, advantage, of, the, confusion, to, attack, the, duchy, of, normandy, but, played, no, direct, role, in, the, english, conflict, leaving, this, to, matilda, and, her, powerful, illegitimate, half, brother, robert, earl, of, gloucester, the, war, termed, the, anarchy, by, historians, dragged, on, and, degenerated, into, a, stalemate, henry, most, likely, spent, part, of, his, childhood, in, his, mother, s, household, in, the, late, 1130s, he, accompanied, matilda, to, normandy, which, would, only, be, fully, taken, by, geoffrey, around, 1144, henry, s, later, childhood, probably, from, the, age, of, seven, was, spent, in, anjou, where, he, was, educated, by, peter, of, saintes, a, noted, grammarian, in, late, 1142, geoffrey, sent, his, nine, year, old, son, to, bristol, the, centre, of, angevin, opposition, to, stephen, in, the, south, west, of, england, accompanied, by, robert, of, gloucester, although, having, children, educated, in, relatives, households, was, common, among, noblemen, of, the, period, sending, henry, to, england, also, had, political, benefits, as, geoffrey, was, coming, under, criticism, by, matilda, s, supporters, for, refusing, to, join, the, war, in, england, for, about, a, year, henry, lived, alongside, roger, of, worcester, one, of, robert, s, sons, and, was, instructed, by, a, magister, master, matthew, robert, s, household, was, known, for, its, education, and, learning, the, canons, of, st, augustine, s, in, bristol, also, helped, in, henry, s, education, and, he, remembered, them, with, affection, in, later, years, henry, returned, to, anjou, in, either, 1143, or, 1144, resuming, his, education, under, william, of, conches, another, famous, academic, henry, returned, to, england, in, 1147, at, the, age, of, fourteen, taking, his, immediate, household, and, a, few, mercenaries, he, left, normandy, and, landed, in, england, striking, into, wiltshire, despite, initially, causing, considerable, panic, the, expedition, had, little, success, and, henry, found, himself, unable, to, pay, his, forces, and, therefore, unable, to, return, to, normandy, neither, his, mother, nor, his, uncle, was, prepared, to, support, him, implying, that, they, had, not, approved, of, the, expedition, in, the, first, place, henry, instead, turned, to, king, stephen, who, paid, the, outstanding, wages, and, thereby, allowed, henry, to, retire, gracefully, stephen, s, reasons, for, doing, so, are, unclear, one, potential, explanation, is, his, general, courtesy, to, a, member, of, his, extended, family, another, is, that, he, was, starting, to, consider, how, to, end, the, war, peacefully, and, saw, this, as, a, way, of, building, a, relationship, with, henry, henry, intervened, once, again, in, 1149, commencing, what, is, often, termed, the, henrician, phase, of, the, civil, war, this, time, henry, planned, to, form, a, northern, alliance, with, king, david, i, of, scotland, his, great, uncle, and, ranulf, of, chester, a, powerful, regional, leader, who, controlled, most, of, the, north, west, of, england, under, this, alliance, henry, and, ranulf, agreed, to, attack, york, probably, with, the, help, of, scots, the, planned, attack, disintegrated, after, stephen, marched, north, to, york, and, henry, returned, to, normandy, henry, was, said, by, chroniclers, to, be, good, looking, red, haired, freckled, with, a, large, head, he, had, a, short, stocky, body, and, was, bow, legged, from, riding, often, he, was, scruffily, dressed, his, preference, for, the, short, angevin, cloak, earned, him, the, nickname, curtmantle, henry, was, neither, as, reserved, as, his, mother, nor, as, charming, as, his, father, but, he, was, famous, for, his, energy, and, drive, he, was, ruthless, but, not, vindictive, he, was, also, infamous, for, his, piercing, stare, bullying, bursts, of, temper, and, on, occasion, his, sullen, refusal, to, speak, at, all, some, of, these, outbursts, may, have, been, theatrical, and, for, effect, henry, was, said, to, have, understood, a, wide, range, of, languages, including, english, but, spoke, only, latin, and, french, in, his, youth, henry, enjoyed, active, participation, in, warfare, hunting, and, other, adventurous, pursuits, as, the, years, went, by, he, put, increasing, energy, into, judicial, and, administrative, affairs, and, became, more, cautious, but, throughout, his, life, he, was, energetic, and, frequently, impulsive, despite, his, surges, of, anger, he, was, not, normally, fiery, or, overbearing, he, was, witty, in, conversation, and, eloquent, in, an, argument, with, an, intellectual, bent, of, mind, and, an, astonishing, memory, and, much, preferred, the, solitude, of, hunting, or, retiring, to, his, chamber, with, a, book, rather, than, the, entertainments, of, tournaments, or, troubadours, he, also, had, concern, for, ordinary, people, ordaining, early, in, his, reign, that, those, shipwrecked, should, be, well, treated, and, prescribing, heavy, penalties, for, anyone, who, plundered, their, goods, the, chronicler, ralph, of, diceto, records, that, when, famine, struck, anjou, and, maine, in, 1176, henry, emptied, his, private, stores, to, relieve, distress, among, the, poor, henry, had, a, passionate, desire, to, rebuild, his, control, of, the, territories, that, his, grandfather, henry, i, had, once, governed, he, took, back, territories, regained, estates, and, re, established, influence, over, the, smaller, lords, that, had, once, provided, what, the, historian, john, gillingham, describes, as, a, protective, ring, around, his, core, territories, he, was, probably, the, first, king, of, england, to, use, a, heraldic, design, a, signet, ring, with, either, a, leopard, or, a, lion, engraved, on, it, the, design, would, be, altered, in, later, generations, to, form, the, royal, arms, of, england, by, the, late, 1140s, the, active, phase, of, the, civil, war, was, over, barring, the, occasional, outbreak, of, fighting, many, of, the, barons, were, making, individual, peace, agreements, with, one, another, to, secure, their, war, gains, and, it, increasingly, appeared, as, though, the, english, church, was, considering, promoting, a, peace, treaty, on, louis, vii, s, return, from, the, second, crusade, in, 1149, he, became, concerned, about, the, growth, of, geoffrey, s, power, and, the, potential, threat, to, his, own, possessions, especially, if, henry, could, acquire, the, english, crown, in, 1150, geoffrey, made, henry, the, duke, of, normandy, and, louis, responded, by, putting, forward, king, stephen, s, son, eustace, as, the, rightful, heir, to, the, duchy, and, launching, a, military, campaign, to, remove, henry, from, the, province, geoffrey, advised, henry, to, come, to, terms, with, louis, and, peace, was, made, between, them, in, august, 1151, after, mediation, by, bernard, of, clairvaux, under, the, settlement, henry, did, homage, to, louis, for, normandy, accepting, louis, as, his, feudal, lord, and, gave, him, the, disputed, lands, of, the, norman, vexin, in, return, louis, recognised, him, as, duke, geoffrey, died, in, september, 1151, and, henry, postponed, his, plans, to, return, to, england, as, he, first, needed, to, ensure, that, his, succession, particularly, in, anjou, was, secure, at, around, this, time, he, was, also, probably, secretly, planning, his, marriage, to, eleanor, then, still, the, wife, of, louis, eleanor, was, the, duchess, of, aquitaine, a, land, in, the, south, of, france, and, was, considered, beautiful, lively, and, controversial, but, had, not, borne, louis, any, sons, louis, had, the, marriage, annulled, on, the, grounds, of, consanguinity, and, the, nineteen, year, old, henry, married, eleanor, who, was, eleven, years, his, senior, eight, weeks, later, on, 18, may, the, marriage, instantly, revived, henry, s, tensions, with, louis, it, was, considered, an, insult, and, ran, counter, to, feudal, practice, because, eleanor, a, holder, of, a, french, fiefdom, married, without, louis, s, consent, and, the, marriage, between, henry, and, eleanor, was, just, as, consanguineous, as, that, of, her, and, louis, henry, s, acquisition, of, aquitaine, also, threatened, the, inheritance, of, louis, and, eleanor, s, two, daughters, marie, and, alix, who, might, otherwise, have, had, claims, to, aquitaine, on, eleanor, s, death, with, his, new, lands, henry, now, possessed, a, much, larger, proportion, of, france, than, louis, louis, organised, a, coalition, against, henry, including, king, stephen, his, son, eustace, henry, i, count, of, champagne, and, robert, count, of, perche, louis, s, alliance, was, joined, by, henry, s, younger, brother, geoffrey, who, rose, in, revolt, claiming, that, henry, had, dispossessed, him, of, his, inheritance, their, father, s, plans, for, the, inheritance, of, his, lands, had, been, ambiguous, making, the, veracity, of, geoffrey, s, claims, hard, to, assess, contemporaneous, accounts, suggest, he, left, the, main, castles, in, poitou, to, geoffrey, implying, that, he, may, have, intended, henry, to, retain, normandy, and, anjou, but, not, poitou, fighting, immediately, broke, out, again, along, the, normandy, borders, where, henry, of, champagne, and, robert, captured, the, town, of, neufmarch, sur, epte, louis, s, forces, moved, to, attack, aquitaine, stephen, responded, by, placing, wallingford, castle, a, key, fortress, loyal, to, henry, along, the, thames, valley, under, siege, possibly, in, an, attempt, to, force, a, successful, end, to, the, english, conflict, while, henry, was, still, fighting, for, his, territories, in, france, henry, moved, quickly, in, response, avoiding, open, battle, with, louis, in, aquitaine, and, stabilising, the, norman, border, pillaging, the, vexin, and, then, striking, south, into, anjou, against, geoffrey, capturing, one, of, his, main, castles, montsoreau, louis, fell, ill, and, withdrew, from, the, campaign, and, geoffrey, was, forced, to, come, to, terms, with, henry, in, response, to, stephen, s, siege, henry, returned, to, england, again, at, the, start, of, 1153, bringing, only, a, small, army, of, mercenaries, probably, financed, with, borrowed, money, henry, was, supported, in, the, north, and, east, of, england, by, the, forces, of, ranulf, of, chester, and, hugh, bigod, two, local, aristocrats, and, had, hopes, of, a, military, victory, a, delegation, of, senior, english, clergy, met, with, henry, and, his, advisers, at, stockbridge, hampshire, shortly, before, easter, in, april, details, of, their, discussions, are, unclear, but, it, appears, that, the, churchmen, emphasised, that, while, they, supported, stephen, as, king, they, sought, a, negotiated, peace, henry, reaffirmed, that, he, would, avoid, the, english, cathedrals, and, would, not, expect, the, bishops, to, attend, his, court, to, draw, stephen, s, forces, away, from, wallingford, henry, besieged, stephen, s, castle, at, malmesbury, and, the, king, responded, by, marching, west, with, an, army, to, relieve, it, henry, successfully, evaded, stephen, s, larger, army, along, the, river, avon, preventing, stephen, from, forcing, a, decisive, battle, in, the, face, of, the, increasingly, wintry, weather, the, two, men, agreed, to, a, temporary, truce, leaving, henry, to, travel, north, through, the, midlands, where, the, powerful, robert, de, beaumont, earl, of, leicester, announced, his, support, for, the, cause, henry, was, then, free, to, turn, his, forces, south, against, the, besiegers, at, wallingford, despite, only, modest, military, successes, he, and, his, allies, now, controlled, the, south, west, the, midlands, and, much, of, the, north, of, england, meanwhile, henry, was, attempting, to, act, the, part, of, a, legitimate, king, witnessing, marriages, and, settlements, and, holding, court, in, a, regal, fashion, stephen, amassed, troops, over, the, following, summer, to, renew, the, siege, of, wallingford, castle, in, a, final, attempt, to, take, the, stronghold, the, fall, of, wallingford, seemed, imminent, and, henry, marched, south, to, relieve, the, siege, arriving, with, a, small, army, and, placing, stephen, s, besieging, forces, under, siege, themselves, upon, news, of, this, stephen, returned, with, a, large, army, and, the, two, sides, confronted, each, other, across, the, river, thames, at, wallingford, in, july, by, this, point, in, the, war, the, barons, on, both, sides, were, eager, to, avoid, an, open, battle, so, members, of, the, clergy, brokered, a, truce, to, the, annoyance, of, both, henry, and, stephen, henry, and, stephen, took, the, opportunity, to, speak, together, privately, about, a, potential, end, to, the, war, conveniently, for, henry, stephen, s, son, eustace, fell, ill, and, died, shortly, afterwards, this, removed, the, most, obvious, other, claimant, to, the, throne, as, while, stephen, had, another, son, william, he, was, only, a, second, son, and, appeared, unenthusiastic, about, making, a, plausible, claim, on, the, throne, fighting, continued, after, wallingford, but, in, a, rather, half, hearted, fashion, while, the, english, church, attempted, to, broker, a, permanent, peace, between, the, two, sides, in, november, the, two, leaders, ratified, the, terms, of, a, permanent, peace, stephen, announced, the, treaty, of, winchester, in, winchester, cathedral, he, recognised, henry, as, his, adopted, son, and, successor, in, return, for, henry, paying, homage, to, him, stephen, promised, to, listen, to, henry, s, advice, but, retained, all, his, royal, powers, stephen, s, son, william, would, pay, homage, to, henry, and, renounce, his, claim, to, the, throne, in, exchange, for, promises, of, the, security, of, his, lands, key, royal, castles, would, be, held, on, henry, s, behalf, by, guarantors, whilst, stephen, would, have, access, to, henry, s, castles, and, the, numerous, foreign, mercenaries, would, be, demobilised, and, sent, home, henry, and, stephen, sealed, the, treaty, with, a, kiss, of, peace, in, the, cathedral, in, early, 1154, stephen, became, more, active, he, attempted, to, exert, his, authority, and, started, demolishing, unauthorised, castles, the, peace, remained, precarious, and, stephen, s, son, william, remained, a, possible, future, rival, to, henry, rumours, of, a, plot, to, kill, henry, were, circulating, and, possibly, as, a, consequence, henry, returned, to, normandy, for, a, period, stephen, fell, ill, with, a, stomach, disorder, and, died, on, 25, october, 1154, allowing, henry, to, inherit, the, throne, sooner, than, had, been, expected, on, landing, in, england, on, 8, december, 1154, henry, quickly, took, oaths, of, loyalty, from, some, of, the, barons, and, was, then, crowned, alongside, eleanor, at, westminster, abbey, on, 19, december, at, the, coronation, henry, wore, one, of, the, imperial, crowns, his, mother, brought, back, from, germany, they, had, once, belonged, to, emperor, henry, v, the, royal, court, was, gathered, in, april, 1155, where, the, barons, swore, fealty, to, the, king, and, his, sons, several, potential, rivals, still, existed, including, stephen, s, son, william, and, henry, s, brothers, geoffrey, and, william, but, they, all, died, in, the, next, few, years, leaving, henry, s, position, secure, nonetheless, henry, inherited, a, difficult, situation, in, england, as, the, kingdom, had, suffered, extensively, during, the, civil, war, in, many, parts, of, the, country, the, fighting, had, caused, serious, devastation, although, some, other, areas, remained, largely, unaffected, numerous, adulterine, or, unauthorised, castles, had, been, built, as, bases, for, local, lords, the, authority, of, the, royal, forest, law, had, collapsed, in, large, parts, of, the, country, the, king, s, income, had, declined, seriously, and, royal, control, over, the, coin, mints, remained, limited, henry, presented, himself, as, the, legitimate, heir, to, henry, i, and, began, rebuilding, the, kingdom, in, his, image, although, stephen, had, tried, to, continue, henry, i, s, method, of, government, during, his, reign, the, younger, henry, s, new, government, characterised, those, nineteen, years, as, a, chaotic, and, troubled, period, with, all, these, problems, resulting, from, stephen, s, usurpation, of, the, throne, henry, was, also, careful, to, show, that, unlike, his, mother, he, would, listen, to, the, advice, and, counsel, of, others, various, measures, were, immediately, carried, out, although, since, henry, spent, six, and, a, half, years, out, of, the, first, eight, years, of, his, reign, in, france, much, work, had, to, be, done, at, a, distance, the, process, of, demolishing, the, unauthorised, castles, from, the, war, continued, efforts, were, made, to, restore, the, system, of, royal, justice, and, the, royal, finances, henry, also, invested, heavily, in, the, construction, and, renovation, of, prestigious, new, royal, buildings, the, king, of, scotland, and, local, welsh, rulers, had, taken, advantage, of, the, long, civil, war, in, england, to, seize, disputed, lands, henry, set, about, reversing, these, losses, in, 1157, pressure, from, henry, resulted, in, the, young, malcolm, iv, of, scotland, returning, the, lands, in, the, north, of, england, he, had, taken, during, the, war, henry, promptly, began, to, refortify, the, northern, frontier, restoring, anglo, norman, supremacy, in, wales, proved, harder, and, henry, had, to, fight, two, campaigns, in, north, and, south, wales, in, 1157, and, 1158, before, the, welsh, princes, owain, gwynedd, and, rhys, ap, gruffydd, submitted, to, his, rule, agreeing, to, the, pre, civil, war, borders, henry, had, a, difficult, relationship, with, louis, vii, of, france, throughout, the, 1150s, the, two, men, had, already, clashed, over, henry, s, succession, to, normandy, and, the, remarriage, of, eleanor, and, the, relationship, was, not, repaired, louis, invariably, attempted, to, take, the, moral, high, ground, in, respect, to, henry, capitalising, on, his, own, reputation, as, a, crusader, and, circulating, malicious, rumours, about, his, rival, s, ungovernable, temper, henry, had, greater, resources, than, louis, particularly, after, taking, england, and, louis, was, far, less, dynamic, in, resisting, angevin, power, than, he, had, been, earlier, in, his, reign, the, disputes, between, the, two, drew, in, other, powers, across, the, region, including, thierry, count, of, flanders, who, signed, a, military, alliance, with, henry, albeit, with, a, clause, that, prevented, the, count, from, being, forced, to, fight, against, louis, his, feudal, lord, further, south, theobald, v, count, of, blois, an, enemy, of, louis, became, another, early, ally, of, henry, the, resulting, military, tensions, and, the, frequent, face, to, face, meetings, to, attempt, to, resolve, them, have, led, the, historian, jean, dunbabin, to, liken, the, situation, to, the, 20th, century, cold, war, in, europe, on, his, return, to, the, continent, from, england, in, the, 1150s, henry, sought, to, secure, his, french, lands, and, quash, any, potential, rebellion, to, this, end, in, 1154, henry, and, louis, agreed, to, a, peace, treaty, under, which, henry, bought, back, vernon, and, neuf, march, from, louis, the, treaty, appeared, shaky, and, tensions, remained, in, particular, henry, had, not, given, homage, to, louis, for, his, french, possessions, they, met, at, paris, and, mont, saint, michel, in, 1158, agreeing, to, betroth, henry, s, eldest, living, son, the, young, henry, to, louis, s, daughter, margaret, the, marriage, deal, would, have, involved, louis, granting, the, disputed, territory, of, the, vexin, to, margaret, on, her, marriage, to, the, young, henry, while, this, would, ultimately, give, henry, the, lands, that, he, claimed, it, also, implied, that, the, vexin, was, louis, s, to, give, away, in, the, first, place, in, itself, a, political, concession, for, a, short, while, a, permanent, peace, between, henry, and, louis, looked, plausible, meanwhile, henry, turned, his, attention, to, the, duchy, of, brittany, which, neighboured, his, lands, and, retained, strong, traditions, of, independence, the, breton, dukes, held, little, power, across, most, of, the, duchy, which, was, mostly, controlled, by, local, lords, in, 1148, duke, conan, iii, died, and, civil, war, broke, out, henry, claimed, to, be, the, overlord, of, brittany, on, the, basis, that, the, duchy, had, owed, loyalty, to, henry, i, and, saw, controlling, the, duchy, both, as, a, way, of, securing, his, other, french, territories, and, as, a, potential, inheritance, for, one, of, his, sons, initially, henry, s, strategy, was, to, rule, indirectly, through, proxies, and, accordingly, henry, supported, conan, iv, s, claims, over, most, of, the, duchy, partly, because, conan, had, strong, english, ties, and, could, be, easily, influenced, conan, s, uncle, ho, l, continued, to, control, the, county, of, nantes, in, the, east, until, he, was, deposed, in, 1156, by, henry, s, brother, geoffrey, possibly, with, henry, s, support, when, geoffrey, died, in, 1158, conan, attempted, to, reclaim, nantes, but, was, opposed, by, henry, who, annexed, it, for, himself, louis, took, no, action, to, intervene, as, henry, steadily, increased, his, power, in, brittany, henry, hoped, to, take, a, similar, approach, to, regaining, control, of, toulouse, in, southern, france, toulouse, while, traditionally, tied, to, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, had, become, increasingly, independent, and, was, now, ruled, by, count, raymond, v, the, rulers, of, aquitaine, had, made, tenuous, claims, on, the, county, by, hereditary, right, henry, now, hoped, to, claim, it, on, eleanor, s, behalf, and, encouraged, by, her, henry, first, allied, himself, with, raymond, s, enemy, raymond, berenguer, of, barcelona, and, then, in, 1159, threatened, to, invade, himself, to, depose, the, count, of, toulouse, louis, married, his, sister, constance, to, the, count, in, an, attempt, to, secure, his, southern, frontiers, nonetheless, when, henry, and, louis, discussed, the, matter, of, toulouse, henry, left, believing, that, he, had, the, french, king, s, support, for, military, intervention, henry, invaded, toulouse, only, to, find, louis, visiting, raymond, in, the, city, henry, was, not, prepared, to, directly, attack, louis, who, was, still, his, feudal, lord, and, withdrew, contenting, himself, with, ravaging, the, surrounding, county, seizing, castles, and, taking, the, province, of, quercy, the, episode, proved, to, be, a, long, running, point, of, dispute, between, the, two, kings, and, the, chronicler, william, of, newburgh, called, the, ensuing, conflict, with, toulouse, a, forty, years, war, in, the, aftermath, of, the, toulouse, episode, louis, made, an, attempt, to, repair, relations, with, henry, through, an, 1160, peace, treaty, this, promised, henry, the, lands, and, the, rights, of, his, grandfather, henry, i, it, reaffirmed, the, betrothal, of, young, henry, and, margaret, and, the, vexin, deal, and, it, involved, young, henry, giving, homage, to, louis, a, way, of, reinforcing, the, young, boy, s, position, as, heir, and, louis, s, position, as, king, almost, immediately, after, the, peace, conference, louis, shifted, his, position, considerably, his, wife, constance, died, and, he, married, ad, le, the, sister, of, the, counts, of, blois, and, champagne, louis, also, betrothed, daughters, by, eleanor, to, ad, le, s, brothers, theobald, v, count, of, blois, and, henry, i, count, of, champagne, this, represented, an, aggressive, containment, strategy, towards, henry, rather, than, the, agreed, rapprochement, and, caused, theobald, to, abandon, his, alliance, with, henry, henry, who, had, custody, of, both, young, henry, and, margaret, reacted, angrily, and, in, november, he, bullied, several, papal, legates, into, marrying, them, despite, the, children, being, only, five, and, three, years, old, respectively, and, promptly, seized, the, vexin, now, it, was, louis, s, turn, to, be, furious, as, the, move, clearly, broke, the, spirit, of, the, 1160, treaty, military, tensions, between, the, two, leaders, immediately, increased, theobald, mobilised, his, forces, along, the, border, with, touraine, henry, responded, by, attacking, chaumont, in, blois, in, a, surprise, attack, and, took, theobald, s, castle, in, a, siege, at, the, start, of, 1161, war, seemed, likely, to, spread, across, the, region, until, a, fresh, peace, was, negotiated, at, fr, teval, that, autumn, followed, by, a, second, peace, treaty, in, 1162, overseen, by, pope, alexander, iii, despite, this, temporary, halt, in, hostilities, henry, s, seizure, of, the, vexin, started, a, second, long, running, dispute, between, him, and, the, kings, of, france, henry, controlled, more, of, france, than, any, ruler, since, the, 9th, century, carolingians, these, lands, combined, with, his, possessions, in, england, wales, scotland, and, later, parts, of, ireland, produced, a, vast, domain, often, referred, to, by, historians, as, the, angevin, empire, the, empire, lacked, a, coherent, structure, or, central, control, instead, it, consisted, of, a, loose, flexible, network, of, family, connections, and, lands, different, local, customs, applied, within, each, of, henry, s, different, territories, although, common, principles, underpinned, some, of, these, local, variations, henry, travelled, constantly, across, the, empire, producing, what, the, historian, john, edward, austin, jolliffe, describes, as, a, government, of, the, roads, and, roadsides, his, journeys, coincided, with, regional, governmental, reforms, and, other, local, administrative, business, although, messengers, were, able, to, connect, him, to, all, of, his, domains, wherever, he, went, in, his, absence, the, lands, were, ruled, by, seneschals, and, justiciars, and, beneath, them, local, officials, in, each, of, the, regions, carried, on, with, the, business, of, government, nonetheless, many, of, the, functions, of, government, centred, on, henry, himself, and, he, was, often, surrounded, by, petitioners, requesting, decisions, or, favours, from, time, to, time, henry, s, royal, court, became, a, magnum, concilium, a, great, council, which, was, sometimes, used, to, take, major, decisions, but, the, term, was, loosely, applied, whenever, many, barons, and, bishops, attended, the, king, a, great, council, was, supposed, to, advise, the, king, and, give, assent, to, royal, decisions, yet, it, is, unclear, how, much, freedom, they, actually, enjoyed, to, oppose, henry, s, intentions, henry, also, appears, to, have, consulted, with, his, court, when, making, legislation, the, extent, to, which, he, then, took, their, views, into, account, is, unclear, as, a, powerful, ruler, henry, was, able, to, provide, either, valuable, patronage, or, impose, devastating, harm, on, his, subjects, he, was, very, effective, at, finding, and, keeping, competent, officials, including, within, the, church, a, key, part, of, royal, administration, in, the, 12th, century, royal, patronage, within, the, church, provided, an, effective, route, to, advancement, under, henry, and, most, of, his, preferred, clerics, eventually, became, bishops, and, archbishops, by, contrast, the, number, of, earldoms, in, england, shrank, considerably, removing, the, potential, for, advancement, for, many, traditional, barons, henry, could, also, show, his, ira, et, malevolentia, anger, and, ill, will, a, term, that, described, his, ability, to, punish, or, financially, destroy, particular, barons, or, clergy, in, england, henry, initially, relied, on, his, father, s, former, advisers, whom, he, brought, with, him, from, normandy, and, on, some, of, henry, i, s, remaining, officials, reinforced, with, some, of, stephen, s, senior, nobility, who, made, their, peace, with, henry, in, 1153, during, his, reign, henry, like, his, grandfather, increasingly, promoted, new, men, minor, nobles, without, independent, wealth, and, lands, to, positions, of, authority, in, england, by, the, 1180s, this, new, class, of, royal, administrators, was, predominant, in, england, supported, by, various, illegitimate, members, of, henry, s, family, the, links, between, the, nobility, in, normandy, and, england, had, weakened, during, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, and, continued, to, do, so, under, henry, henry, drew, his, close, advisers, from, the, ranks, of, the, norman, bishops, and, as, in, england, recruited, many, new, men, as, norman, administrators, few, of, the, larger, landowners, in, normandy, benefited, from, the, king, s, patronage, he, frequently, intervened, with, the, norman, nobility, through, arranged, marriages, or, the, treatment, of, inheritances, either, using, his, authority, as, duke, or, his, influence, as, king, of, england, over, their, lands, there, across, the, rest, of, france, local, administration, was, less, developed, anjou, was, governed, through, a, combination, of, officials, called, pr, v, ts, and, seneschals, based, along, the, loire, and, in, western, touraine, but, henry, had, few, officials, elsewhere, in, the, region, in, aquitaine, ducal, authority, remained, very, limited, despite, increasing, substantially, during, henry, s, reign, largely, owing, to, richard, s, efforts, in, the, late, 1170s, henry, s, wealth, allowed, him, to, maintain, what, was, probably, the, largest, curia, regis, or, royal, court, in, europe, his, court, attracted, huge, attention, from, contemporary, chroniclers, and, typically, comprised, several, major, nobles, and, bishops, along, with, knights, domestic, servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses, and, hunting, dogs, within, the, court, were, his, officials, ministeriales, his, friends, amici, and, his, small, inner, circle, of, confidants, and, trusted, servants, familiares, regis, henry, s, familiares, were, particularly, important, to, the, operation, of, his, household, and, government, as, they, drove, government, initiatives, and, filled, the, gaps, between, the, official, structures, and, the, king, henry, tried, to, maintain, a, sophisticated, household, that, combined, hunting, and, drinking, with, cosmopolitan, literary, discussion, and, courtly, values, nonetheless, henry, s, passion, was, for, hunting, for, which, the, court, became, famous, henry, had, several, preferred, royal, hunting, lodges, and, apartments, across, his, lands, and, invested, heavily, in, his, royal, castles, both, for, their, practical, utility, as, fortresses, and, as, symbols, of, royal, power, and, prestige, the, court, was, relatively, formal, in, its, style, and, language, possibly, because, henry, was, attempting, to, compensate, for, his, own, sudden, rise, to, power, and, relatively, humble, origins, as, the, son, of, a, count, he, opposed, the, holding, of, tournaments, probably, because, of, the, security, risk, that, such, gatherings, of, armed, knights, posed, in, peacetime, the, angevin, empire, and, court, were, as, gillingham, describes, it, a, family, firm, his, mother, matilda, played, an, important, role, in, his, early, life, and, exercised, influence, for, many, years, later, henry, s, relationship, with, his, wife, eleanor, was, complex, henry, trusted, eleanor, to, manage, england, for, several, years, after, 1154, and, was, later, content, for, her, to, govern, aquitaine, indeed, eleanor, was, believed, to, have, influence, over, henry, during, much, of, their, marriage, ultimately, their, relationship, disintegrated, chroniclers, and, historians, have, speculated, on, what, ultimately, caused, eleanor, to, abandon, henry, to, support, her, older, sons, in, the, revolt, of, 1173, 1174, probable, explanations, include, his, persistent, interference, in, aquitaine, henry, s, rather, than, eleanor, s, acceptance, of, homage, from, raymond, of, toulouse, in, 1173, and, his, harsh, temper, henry, had, eight, legitimate, children, by, eleanor, five, sons, william, young, henry, richard, geoffrey, and, john, and, three, daughters, matilda, eleanor, and, joan, he, had, several, long, term, mistresses, including, annabel, de, balliol, and, rosamund, clifford, and, also, several, illegitimate, children, amongst, the, most, prominent, of, these, were, geoffrey, later, archbishop, of, york, and, william, later, earl, of, salisbury, henry, was, expected, to, provide, for, the, future, of, his, legitimate, children, by, granting, lands, to, his, sons, and, marrying, his, daughters, well, his, family, was, divided, by, rivalries, and, violent, hostilities, more, so, than, many, other, royal, families, of, the, day, in, particular, the, relatively, cohesive, french, capetians, various, suggestions, from, their, inherited, family, genetics, to, the, failure, of, henry, and, eleanor, s, parenting, have, been, put, forward, to, explain, henry, s, family, s, bitter, disputes, other, theories, focus, on, the, personalities, of, henry, and, his, children, historians, such, as, matthew, strickland, have, argued, that, henry, made, sensible, attempts, to, manage, the, tensions, within, his, family, and, that, had, he, died, younger, the, succession, might, have, proved, much, smoother, henry, s, reign, saw, important, legal, changes, particularly, in, england, and, normandy, by, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, england, had, many, different, ecclesiastical, and, civil, law, courts, with, overlapping, jurisdictions, resulting, from, the, interaction, of, diverse, legal, traditions, henry, greatly, expanded, the, role, of, royal, justice, in, england, producing, a, more, coherent, legal, system, summarised, at, the, end, of, his, reign, in, the, treatise, of, glanvill, an, early, legal, handbook, despite, these, reforms, it, is, uncertain, if, henry, had, a, grand, vision, for, his, new, legal, system, and, the, reforms, seem, to, have, proceeded, in, a, steady, pragmatic, fashion, indeed, some, scholars, believe, that, in, most, cases, he, was, probably, not, personally, responsible, for, creating, the, new, processes, but, he, was, greatly, interested, in, the, law, seeing, the, delivery, of, justice, as, one, of, the, key, tasks, for, a, king, and, carefully, appointing, good, administrators, to, conduct, the, reforms, in, the, aftermath, of, the, disorders, of, stephen, s, reign, in, england, there, were, many, legal, cases, concerning, land, to, be, resolved, many, religious, houses, had, lost, land, during, the, conflict, while, in, other, cases, owners, and, heirs, had, been, dispossessed, of, their, property, by, local, barons, which, in, some, cases, had, since, been, sold, or, given, to, new, owners, henry, relied, on, traditional, local, courts, such, as, the, shire, courts, hundred, courts, and, in, particular, seignorial, courts, to, deal, with, most, of, these, cases, hearing, only, a, few, personally, this, process, was, far, from, perfect, and, in, many, cases, claimants, were, unable, to, pursue, their, cases, effectively, while, interested, in, the, law, during, the, first, years, of, his, reign, henry, was, preoccupied, with, other, political, issues, and, even, finding, the, king, for, a, hearing, could, mean, travelling, across, the, channel, and, locating, his, peripatetic, court, nonetheless, he, was, prepared, to, take, action, to, improve, the, existing, procedures, intervening, in, cases, which, he, felt, had, been, mishandled, and, creating, legislation, to, improve, both, ecclesiastical, and, civil, court, processes, meanwhile, in, normandy, henry, delivered, justice, through, the, courts, run, by, his, officials, across, the, duchy, and, occasionally, these, cases, made, their, way, to, the, king, himself, he, also, operated, an, exchequer, court, at, caen, that, heard, cases, relating, to, royal, revenues, and, maintained, king, s, justices, who, travelled, across, the, duchy, between, 1159, and, 1163, henry, spent, time, in, normandy, conducting, reforms, of, royal, and, church, courts, and, some, measures, later, introduced, in, england, are, recorded, as, existing, in, normandy, as, early, as, 1159, in, 1163, henry, returned, to, england, intent, on, reforming, the, role, of, the, royal, courts, he, cracked, down, on, crime, seizing, the, belongings, of, thieves, and, fugitives, and, travelling, justices, were, dispatched, to, the, north, and, the, midlands, after, 1166, henry, s, exchequer, court, in, westminster, which, had, previously, only, heard, cases, connected, with, royal, revenues, began, to, take, wider, civil, cases, on, behalf, of, the, king, the, reforms, continued, and, henry, created, the, general, eyre, probably, in, 1176, which, involved, dispatching, a, group, of, royal, justices, to, visit, all, the, counties, in, england, over, a, given, period, of, time, with, authority, to, cover, both, civil, and, criminal, cases, a, local, jury, had, been, used, occasionally, in, previous, reigns, but, henry, made, much, wider, use, of, them, juries, were, introduced, in, petty, assizes, from, around, 1176, where, they, were, used, to, establish, the, answers, to, particular, pre, established, questions, and, in, grand, assizes, from, 1179, where, they, were, used, to, determine, the, guilt, of, a, defendant, other, methods, of, trial, continued, including, trial, by, combat, and, trial, by, ordeal, after, the, assize, of, clarendon, in, 1166, royal, justice, was, extended, into, new, areas, through, the, use, of, new, forms, of, assizes, in, particular, novel, disseisin, mort, d, ancestor, and, dower, unde, nichil, habet, which, dealt, with, the, wrongful, dispossession, of, land, inheritance, rights, and, the, rights, of, widows, respectively, in, making, these, reforms, henry, both, challenged, the, traditional, rights, of, barons, in, dispensing, justice, and, reinforced, key, feudal, principles, but, over, time, they, greatly, increased, royal, power, in, england, henry, s, relationship, with, the, church, varied, considerably, across, his, lands, and, over, time, as, with, other, aspects, of, his, rule, there, was, no, attempt, to, form, a, common, ecclesiastical, policy, insofar, as, he, had, a, policy, it, was, to, generally, resist, papal, influence, increasing, his, own, local, authority, the, 12th, century, saw, the, continuation, of, the, ongoing, reform, movement, within, the, catholic, church, advocating, greater, clerical, autonomy, from, royal, authority, and, more, influence, for, the, papacy, this, trend, had, already, caused, tensions, in, england, for, example, when, king, stephen, forced, theobald, of, bec, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, into, exile, in, 1152, there, were, also, long, running, concerns, over, royal, jurisdiction, over, members, of, the, clergy, by, contrast, with, the, tensions, in, england, in, normandy, henry, had, occasional, disagreements, with, the, church, but, generally, enjoyed, very, good, relations, with, the, bishops, there, in, brittany, he, had, the, support, of, the, local, church, hierarchy, and, rarely, intervened, in, clerical, matters, except, occasionally, to, cause, difficulties, for, his, rival, louis, of, france, further, south, the, power, of, the, dukes, of, aquitaine, over, the, local, church, was, much, less, than, in, the, north, and, henry, s, efforts, to, extend, his, influence, over, local, appointments, created, tensions, during, the, disputed, papal, election, of, 1159, henry, like, louis, supported, alexander, iii, over, his, rival, victor, iv, the, contemporary, chronicler, gerald, of, wales, promulgated, the, perception, that, henry, was, a, founder, of, monasteries, but, overall, henry, s, religious, convictions, are, difficult, to, assess, this, is, partly, because, to, contemporaries, the, differences, between, founding, and, patronizing, a, house, was, blurred, in, the, scholar, elizabeth, hallam, s, words, henry, ii, was, patron, and, founder, of, many, houses, where, he, had, inherited, this, right, from, his, ancestors, and, predecessors, in, england, he, provided, steady, patronage, to, the, monastic, houses, but, established, few, new, monasteries, of, those, he, did, three, witham, charterhouse, in, somerset, waltham, abbey, in, essex, and, amesbury, in, wiltshire, were, founded, as, part, of, his, penance, for, the, becket, murder, and, built, at, considerable, cost, cirencester, was, also, a, foundation, of, significance, and, comparable, to, those, of, his, forebears, he, was, relatively, conservative, in, religion, and, when, he, did, intervene, in, monastic, affairs, it, usually, regarded, houses, with, established, links, to, his, family, such, as, reading, abbey, founded, by, his, grandfather, henry, i, in, the, struggle, with, becket, contemporaries, believed, that, he, could, have, been, influenced, by, his, mother, before, his, accession, several, charters, including, to, religious, institutions, were, issued, in, their, joint, names, such, as, that, to, the, abbey, st, nicolas, in, angers, in, the, early, 1140s, henry, founded, houses, in, england, and, france, he, had, done, this, sporadically, before, becket, s, death, but, in, hallam, s, words, they, accelerated, dramatically, following, it, as, part, of, his, penance, following, the, death, of, becket, he, built, and, endowed, various, hospitals, particularly, for, lepers, in, france, for, example, at, mont, saint, aignan, which, was, dedicated, to, the, dead, archbishop, since, travel, by, sea, during, the, period, was, dangerous, he, would, also, take, full, confession, before, setting, sail, and, use, auguries, to, determine, the, best, time, to, travel, the, historian, nicholas, vincent, argues, that, henry, s, movements, may, also, have, been, planned, to, take, advantage, of, saints, days, and, other, fortuitous, occasions, medieval, rulers, such, as, henry, enjoyed, various, sources, of, income, during, the, 12th, century, some, of, their, income, came, from, their, private, estates, called, demesne, other, income, came, from, imposing, legal, fines, and, arbitrary, amercements, and, from, taxes, which, at, that, time, were, raised, only, intermittently, kings, could, also, raise, funds, by, borrowing, henry, did, this, far, more, than, earlier, english, rulers, initially, through, moneylenders, in, rouen, turning, later, in, his, reign, to, jewish, and, flemish, lenders, ready, cash, was, increasingly, important, to, rulers, during, the, 12th, century, to, pay, mercenary, forces, and, to, build, stone, castles, both, vital, to, successful, military, campaigns, henry, inherited, a, difficult, situation, in, england, in, 1154, henry, i, had, established, a, system, of, royal, finances, that, depended, upon, three, key, institutions, a, central, royal, treasury, in, london, supported, by, treasuries, in, key, castles, the, exchequer, that, accounted, for, payments, to, the, treasuries, and, a, team, of, royal, officials, called, the, chamber, who, followed, the, king, s, travels, spending, money, as, necessary, and, collecting, revenues, along, the, way, the, long, civil, war, had, caused, considerable, disruption, to, this, system, and, calculations, based, on, incomplete, pipe, rolls, suggest, that, royal, income, fell, by, 46, per, cent, between, 1129, 30, and, 1155, 56, a, new, coin, called, the, awbridge, silver, penny, was, issued, under, stephen, in, 1153, to, try, to, stabilise, the, english, currency, after, the, war, it, was, effective, in, replacing, the, previously, circulating, currency, less, is, known, about, how, financial, affairs, were, managed, in, henry, s, continental, possessions, but, a, very, similar, system, operated, in, normandy, and, a, comparable, system, probably, operated, in, both, anjou, and, aquitaine, on, taking, power, henry, gave, a, high, priority, to, the, restoration, of, royal, finances, in, england, reviving, henry, i, s, financial, processes, and, institutions, and, attempting, to, improve, the, quality, of, the, royal, accounting, revenue, from, the, demesne, formed, the, bulk, of, henry, s, income, in, england, during, much, of, his, reign, although, taxes, were, relied, upon, heavily, in, the, first, 11, years, aided, by, the, capable, richard, fitzneal, he, reformed, the, currency, in, 1158, putting, his, name, on, english, coins, for, the, first, time, and, greatly, reducing, the, number, of, moneyers, licensed, to, produce, coins, these, measures, were, successful, in, improving, henry, s, income, but, on, his, return, to, england, in, the, 1160s, he, took, further, steps, new, taxes, were, introduced, and, the, existing, accounts, re, audited, and, the, reforms, of, the, legal, system, brought, in, new, streams, of, money, from, fines, and, amercements, there, was, a, wholesale, reform, of, the, coinage, in, 1180, with, royal, officials, taking, direct, control, of, the, mints, and, passing, the, profits, directly, to, the, treasury, a, new, penny, called, the, short, cross, was, introduced, and, the, number, of, mints, reduced, substantially, to, ten, across, the, country, driven, by, the, reforms, the, royal, revenues, increased, considerably, during, the, first, part, of, the, reign, henry, s, average, exchequer, income, was, only, around, 18, 000, after, 1166, the, average, was, around, 22, 000, one, economic, effect, of, these, changes, was, a, substantial, increase, in, the, amount, of, money, in, circulation, in, england, and, post, 1180, a, long, term, increase, in, both, inflation, and, trade, long, running, tensions, between, henry, and, louis, vii, continued, during, the, 1160s, the, french, king, slowly, becoming, more, vigorous, in, opposing, henry, s, increasing, power, in, europe, in, 1160, louis, strengthened, his, alliances, in, central, france, with, the, count, of, champagne, and, odo, ii, duke, of, burgundy, three, years, later, the, new, count, of, flanders, philip, concerned, about, henry, s, growing, power, openly, allied, himself, with, the, french, king, louis, s, wife, ad, le, gave, birth, to, a, male, heir, philip, augustus, in, 1165, and, louis, was, more, confident, of, his, own, position, than, for, many, years, previously, as, a, result, relations, between, henry, and, louis, deteriorated, again, in, the, mid, 1160s, meanwhile, henry, had, begun, to, alter, his, policy, of, indirect, rule, in, brittany, and, started, to, exert, more, direct, control, in, 1164, he, intervened, to, seize, lands, along, the, border, of, brittany, and, normandy, and, in, 1166, invaded, brittany, to, punish, the, local, barons, henry, then, forced, conan, iii, to, abdicate, as, duke, and, to, give, brittany, to, his, daughter, constance, who, was, handed, over, and, betrothed, to, henry, s, son, geoffrey, this, arrangement, was, quite, unusual, under, medieval, law, as, conan, might, have, had, sons, who, could, have, legitimately, inherited, the, duchy, elsewhere, in, france, henry, attempted, to, seize, the, auvergne, much, to, the, anger, of, the, french, king, further, south, henry, continued, to, apply, pressure, on, raymond, of, toulouse, he, campaigned, there, personally, in, 1161, and, sent, his, allies, alfonso, ii, of, aragon, and, the, archbishop, of, bordeaux, against, raymond, in, 1164, in, 1165, raymond, divorced, louis, s, sister, and, possibly, pursued, an, alliance, with, henry, instead, these, growing, tensions, between, henry, and, louis, finally, spilled, over, into, open, war, in, 1167, triggered, by, a, trivial, argument, over, how, money, destined, for, the, crusader, states, of, the, levant, should, be, collected, louis, allied, himself, with, the, welsh, scots, and, bretons, and, attacked, normandy, henry, responded, by, attacking, chaumont, sur, epte, where, louis, kept, his, main, military, arsenal, burning, the, town, to, the, ground, and, forcing, louis, to, abandon, his, allies, and, make, a, private, truce, henry, was, then, free, to, move, against, the, rebel, barons, in, brittany, where, feelings, about, his, seizure, of, the, duchy, were, still, running, high, as, the, decade, progressed, henry, increasingly, desired, to, resolve, the, question, of, the, inheritance, he, decided, that, he, would, divide, his, empire, after, his, death, with, young, henry, receiving, england, and, normandy, richard, being, given, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, and, geoffrey, acquiring, brittany, this, would, require, the, consent, of, louis, accordingly, the, kings, held, fresh, peace, talks, in, 1169, at, montmirail, the, talks, were, wide, ranging, culminating, with, henry, s, sons, giving, homage, to, louis, for, their, future, inheritances, in, france, also, at, this, time, richard, was, betrothed, to, louis, s, young, daughter, alys, alys, came, to, england, and, was, rumoured, to, have, later, become, the, mistress, of, king, henry, but, the, rumour, originates, from, prejudiced, sources, and, is, not, supported, by, french, chronicles, if, the, agreements, at, montmirail, had, been, followed, up, the, acts, of, homage, could, potentially, have, confirmed, louis, s, position, as, king, while, undermining, the, legitimacy, of, any, rebellious, barons, within, henry, s, territories, and, the, potential, for, an, alliance, between, them, and, louis, in, practice, louis, perceived, himself, to, have, gained, a, temporary, advantage, immediately, after, the, conference, he, began, to, encourage, tensions, between, henry, s, sons, meanwhile, henry, s, position, in, the, south, of, france, continued, to, improve, and, by, 1173, he, had, agreed, to, an, alliance, with, humbert, iii, count, of, savoy, which, betrothed, henry, s, son, john, and, humbert, s, daughter, alicia, henry, s, daughter, eleanor, was, married, to, alfonso, viii, of, castile, in, 1170, enlisting, an, additional, ally, in, the, south, in, february, 1173, after, unremitting, pressure, from, henry, since, 1159, raymond, finally, capitulated, to, the, english, king, and, publicly, gave, homage, for, toulouse, to, henry, and, his, heirs, one, of, the, major, international, events, surrounding, henry, during, the, 1160s, was, the, becket, controversy, when, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, theobald, of, bec, died, in, 1161, henry, saw, an, opportunity, to, reassert, his, rights, over, the, church, in, england, henry, appointed, thomas, becket, his, english, chancellor, as, archbishop, in, 1162, according, to, the, historian, thomas, m, jones, henry, probably, believed, that, becket, in, addition, to, being, an, old, friend, would, be, politically, weakened, within, the, church, because, of, his, former, role, as, chancellor, and, would, therefore, have, to, rely, on, his, support, both, henry, s, mother, and, wife, appear, to, have, had, doubts, about, the, appointment, but, nevertheless, he, went, ahead, his, plan, did, not, achieve, the, desired, result, as, becket, promptly, changed, his, lifestyle, abandoned, his, links, to, the, king, and, portrayed, himself, as, a, staunch, protector, of, church, rights, henry, and, becket, quickly, disagreed, over, several, issues, including, becket, s, attempts, to, regain, control, of, lands, belonging, to, the, archbishopric, and, his, views, on, henry, s, taxation, policies, the, main, source, of, conflict, concerned, the, treatment, of, clergy, who, committed, secular, crimes, henry, argued, that, the, legal, custom, in, england, allowed, the, king, to, enforce, justice, over, these, clerics, while, becket, maintained, that, only, church, courts, could, try, the, cases, the, matter, came, to, a, head, in, january, 1164, when, henry, forced, through, agreement, to, the, constitutions, of, clarendon, under, tremendous, pressure, becket, temporarily, agreed, but, changed, his, position, shortly, afterwards, the, legal, argument, was, complex, at, the, time, and, remains, contentious, the, argument, between, henry, and, becket, became, both, increasingly, personal, and, international, in, nature, henry, occasionally, displayed, a, fierce, temper, and, bore, grudges, and, according, to, the, historian, josiah, cox, russell, becket, was, vain, ambitious, and, overly, political, neither, man, was, willing, to, back, down, both, sought, the, support, of, pope, alexander, iii, and, other, international, leaders, arguing, their, positions, in, various, forums, across, europe, the, situation, worsened, in, 1164, when, becket, fled, to, france, to, seek, sanctuary, with, louis, vii, henry, harassed, becket, s, associates, in, england, and, becket, excommunicated, religious, and, secular, officials, who, sided, with, the, king, the, pope, supported, becket, s, case, in, principle, but, needed, henry, s, support, in, dealing, with, frederick, i, holy, roman, emperor, so, he, repeatedly, sought, a, negotiated, solution, the, norman, church, also, intervened, to, assist, henry, in, finding, a, solution, by, 1169, henry, had, decided, to, crown, his, son, young, henry, as, king, of, england, this, required, the, acquiescence, of, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, who, traditionally, had, the, right, to, conduct, the, ceremony, furthermore, the, whole, becket, matter, was, an, increasing, international, embarrassment, to, henry, he, began, to, take, a, more, conciliatory, tone, with, becket, but, when, this, failed, had, young, henry, crowned, anyway, by, the, archbishop, of, york, the, pope, authorised, becket, to, lay, an, interdict, on, england, forcing, henry, back, to, negotiations, they, finally, came, to, terms, in, july, 1170, and, becket, returned, to, england, in, early, december, just, when, the, dispute, seemed, resolved, becket, excommunicated, another, three, supporters, of, henry, infuriating, him, according, to, edward, grim, an, eyewitness, to, becket, s, murder, henry, infamously, announced, what, miserable, drones, and, traitors, have, i, nourished, and, promoted, in, my, household, who, let, their, lord, be, treated, with, such, shameful, contempt, by, a, low, born, clerk, in, response, four, knights, made, their, way, secretly, to, canterbury, apparently, with, the, intent, of, confronting, and, if, necessary, arresting, becket, for, breaking, his, agreement, with, henry, the, archbishop, refused, to, be, arrested, inside, the, sanctuary, of, a, church, so, the, knights, hacked, him, to, death, on, 29, december, 1170, this, event, particularly, in, front, of, an, altar, horrified, christian, europe, although, becket, had, not, been, popular, while, he, was, alive, in, death, he, was, declared, a, martyr, by, the, local, monks, louis, seized, on, the, case, and, despite, efforts, by, the, norman, church, to, prevent, the, french, church, from, taking, action, announced, a, new, interdict, on, henry, s, possessions, henry, was, focused, on, dealing, with, ireland, and, took, no, action, to, arrest, becket, s, killers, arguing, that, he, was, unable, to, do, so, international, pressure, on, henry, grew, and, in, may, 1172, he, negotiated, a, settlement, with, the, papacy, which, effectively, overturned, the, more, controversial, clauses, of, the, constitutions, of, clarendon, and, mandated, that, the, king, go, on, crusade, henry, nevertheless, continued, to, exert, influence, in, any, ecclesiastical, case, which, interested, him, and, royal, power, was, exercised, more, subtly, with, considerable, success, in, the, coming, years, henry, never, actually, went, on, crusade, he, exploited, the, growing, cult, of, becket, for, his, own, ends, in, the, mid, 12th, century, ireland, was, ruled, by, local, kings, with, the, high, king, of, ireland, having, limited, authority, in, the, 1160s, the, king, of, leinster, diarmait, mac, murchada, was, deposed, by, the, high, king, ruaidr, ua, conchobair, after, the, former, s, defeat, by, a, powerful, coalition, diarmait, turned, to, henry, for, assistance, in, 1167, and, the, english, king, agreed, to, allow, diarmait, to, recruit, mercenaries, within, his, empire, diarmait, put, together, a, force, of, anglo, norman, and, flemish, mercenaries, drawn, from, the, welsh, marches, including, richard, de, clare, 2nd, earl, of, pembroke, with, his, new, supporters, he, reclaimed, leinster, but, died, shortly, afterwards, in, 1171, de, clare, then, claimed, leinster, for, himself, the, situation, in, ireland, was, tense, and, the, anglo, normans, heavily, outnumbered, henry, took, this, opportunity, to, intervene, personally, in, ireland, pope, adrian, iv, had, authorised, an, english, invasion, of, ireland, on, the, nominal, grounds, of, organising, the, church, there, henry, took, a, large, army, into, south, wales, forcing, the, rebels, who, had, held, the, area, since, 1165, into, submission, before, sailing, from, pembroke, to, ireland, in, october, 1171, some, of, the, irish, lords, appealed, to, henry, to, protect, them, from, the, anglo, norman, invaders, while, de, clare, offered, to, submit, to, him, if, allowed, to, retain, his, new, possessions, henry, s, timing, was, influenced, by, several, factors, including, encouragement, from, pope, alexander, who, saw, the, opportunity, to, establish, papal, authority, over, the, irish, church, the, critical, factor, appears, to, have, been, henry, s, concern, that, his, nobles, in, the, welsh, marches, would, acquire, independent, territories, of, their, own, in, ireland, beyond, the, reach, of, his, authority, henry, s, intervention, was, successful, and, both, the, irish, and, anglo, normans, in, the, south, and, east, of, ireland, accepted, his, rule, de, clare, was, allowed, to, hold, onto, leinster, as, a, fief, of, the, english, king, henry, undertook, an, extensive, programme, of, castle, building, during, his, visit, in, 1171, to, protect, his, new, territories, the, anglo, normans, had, superior, military, technologies, to, the, irish, and, castles, gave, them, an, advantage, henry, hoped, for, a, longer, term, political, solution, similar, to, his, approach, in, wales, and, scotland, and, in, 1175, he, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, windsor, under, which, ruaidr, ua, conchobair, would, be, recognised, as, the, high, king, of, ireland, giving, homage, to, henry, and, maintaining, stability, on, the, ground, on, his, behalf, this, policy, proved, unsuccessful, as, ua, conchobair, was, unable, to, exert, sufficient, influence, and, force, in, areas, such, as, munster, henry, instead, intervened, more, directly, establishing, a, system, of, local, fiefs, of, his, own, through, a, conference, held, in, oxford, in, 1177, in, 1173, henry, faced, the, great, revolt, an, uprising, by, his, eldest, sons, and, rebellious, barons, supported, by, france, scotland, and, flanders, several, grievances, underpinned, the, revolt, young, henry, was, unhappy, that, despite, the, title, of, king, in, practice, he, made, no, real, decisions, and, his, father, kept, him, chronically, short, of, money, he, had, also, been, very, attached, to, thomas, becket, his, former, tutor, and, may, have, held, his, father, responsible, for, becket, s, death, geoffrey, faced, similar, difficulties, duke, conan, of, brittany, had, died, in, 1171, but, geoffrey, and, constance, were, still, unmarried, leaving, geoffrey, in, limbo, without, his, own, lands, richard, was, encouraged, to, join, the, revolt, as, well, by, eleanor, whose, relationship, with, henry, had, disintegrated, meanwhile, barons, unhappy, with, henry, s, rule, saw, opportunities, to, recover, traditional, powers, and, influence, by, allying, themselves, with, his, sons, the, final, straw, was, henry, s, decision, to, give, his, youngest, son, john, three, major, castles, belonging, to, young, henry, who, first, protested, and, then, fled, to, paris, followed, by, his, brothers, richard, and, geoffrey, eleanor, attempted, to, join, them, but, was, captured, by, henry, s, forces, in, november, louis, supported, young, henry, and, war, became, imminent, young, henry, wrote, to, the, pope, complaining, about, his, father, s, behaviour, and, began, to, acquire, allies, including, king, william, of, scotland, and, the, counts, of, boulogne, flanders, and, blois, all, of, whom, were, promised, lands, if, young, henry, won, major, baronial, revolts, broke, out, in, england, brittany, maine, poitou, and, angoul, me, in, normandy, some, of, the, border, barons, rose, up, and, although, the, majority, of, the, duchy, remained, openly, loyal, there, appears, to, have, been, a, wider, undercurrent, of, discontent, only, anjou, proved, relatively, secure, despite, the, size, and, scope, of, the, crisis, henry, had, several, advantages, including, his, control, of, many, powerful, royal, castles, in, strategic, areas, control, of, most, of, the, english, ports, throughout, the, war, and, his, continuing, popularity, within, the, towns, across, his, empire, in, may, 1173, louis, and, young, henry, probed, the, defences, of, the, vexin, the, main, route, to, the, norman, capital, rouen, armies, invaded, from, flanders, and, blois, attempting, a, pincer, movement, while, rebels, from, brittany, invaded, from, the, west, henry, who, had, been, in, france, in, order, to, receive, absolution, for, the, becket, affair, secretly, travelled, back, to, england, to, order, an, offensive, on, the, rebels, and, on, his, return, counter, attacked, louis, s, army, massacring, many, of, them, and, pushing, the, survivors, back, across, the, norman, border, an, army, was, dispatched, to, drive, back, the, brittany, rebels, whom, henry, then, pursued, surprised, and, captured, henry, offered, to, negotiate, with, his, sons, but, these, discussions, at, gisors, soon, broke, down, meanwhile, the, fighting, in, england, proved, evenly, balanced, until, a, royal, army, defeated, a, large, force, of, rebel, and, flemish, reinforcements, in, september, in, the, battle, of, fornham, henry, took, advantage, of, this, respite, to, crush, the, rebel, strongholds, in, touraine, securing, the, strategically, important, route, through, his, empire, in, january, 1174, the, forces, of, young, henry, and, louis, attacked, again, threatening, to, push, through, into, central, normandy, the, attack, failed, and, the, fighting, paused, while, the, winter, weather, set, in, in, early, 1174, henry, s, enemies, appeared, to, have, tried, to, lure, him, back, into, england, allowing, them, to, attack, normandy, in, his, absence, as, part, of, this, plan, william, of, scotland, attacked, the, north, of, england, supported, by, the, northern, english, rebels, additional, scottish, forces, were, sent, into, the, midlands, where, the, rebel, barons, were, making, good, progress, henry, refused, the, bait, and, instead, focused, on, crushing, opposition, in, south, west, france, william, s, campaign, began, to, falter, as, the, scots, failed, to, take, the, key, northern, royal, castles, in, part, due, to, the, efforts, of, henry, s, illegitimate, son, geoffrey, in, an, effort, to, reinvigorate, the, plan, philip, the, count, of, flanders, announced, his, intention, to, invade, england, and, sent, an, advance, force, into, east, anglia, the, prospective, flemish, invasion, forced, henry, to, return, to, england, in, early, july, louis, and, philip, could, now, push, overland, into, eastern, normandy, and, reached, rouen, henry, travelled, to, becket, s, tomb, in, canterbury, where, he, announced, that, the, rebellion, was, a, divine, punishment, on, him, and, did, appropriate, penance, this, made, a, major, difference, in, restoring, his, royal, authority, at, a, critical, moment, in, the, conflict, word, then, reached, henry, that, king, william, had, been, defeated, and, captured, by, local, forces, at, alnwick, in, northumberland, crushing, the, rebel, cause, in, the, north, the, remaining, english, rebel, strongholds, collapsed, and, in, august, henry, returned, to, normandy, louis, had, not, yet, been, able, to, take, rouen, and, henry, s, forces, fell, upon, the, french, army, just, before, the, final, french, assault, on, the, city, began, pushed, back, into, france, louis, requested, peace, talks, bringing, an, end, to, the, conflict, in, the, aftermath, of, the, great, revolt, henry, held, negotiations, at, montlouis, offering, a, lenient, peace, on, the, basis, of, the, pre, war, status, quo, henry, and, young, henry, swore, not, to, take, revenge, on, each, other, s, followers, young, henry, agreed, to, the, transfer, of, the, disputed, castles, to, john, but, in, exchange, the, elder, henry, agreed, to, give, the, younger, henry, two, castles, in, normandy, and, 15, 000, angevin, pounds, richard, and, geoffrey, were, granted, half, the, revenues, from, aquitaine, and, brittany, respectively, eleanor, was, kept, under, effective, house, arrest, until, henry, s, death, the, rebel, barons, were, kept, imprisoned, for, a, short, time, and, in, some, cases, fined, then, restored, to, their, lands, the, rebel, castles, in, england, and, aquitaine, were, destroyed, henry, was, less, generous, to, william, of, scotland, who, was, not, released, until, he, had, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, falaise, in, december, 1174, under, which, he, publicly, gave, homage, to, henry, and, surrendered, five, key, scottish, castles, to, henry, s, men, philip, of, flanders, declared, his, neutrality, towards, henry, in, return, for, which, the, king, agreed, to, provide, him, with, regular, financial, support, henry, now, appeared, to, his, contemporaries, to, be, stronger, than, ever, and, he, was, courted, as, an, ally, by, many, european, leaders, and, asked, to, arbitrate, over, international, disputes, in, spain, and, germany, he, was, nonetheless, busy, resolving, some, of, the, weaknesses, that, he, believed, had, exacerbated, the, revolt, henry, set, about, extending, royal, justice, in, england, to, reassert, his, authority, and, spent, time, in, normandy, shoring, up, support, amongst, the, barons, the, king, also, made, use, of, the, growing, becket, cult, to, increase, his, own, prestige, using, the, power, of, the, saint, to, explain, his, victory, in, 1174, especially, his, success, in, capturing, william, the, 1174, peace, did, not, deal, with, the, long, running, tensions, between, henry, and, louis, and, these, resurfaced, during, the, late, 1170s, the, two, kings, now, began, to, compete, for, control, of, berry, a, prosperous, region, of, value, to, both, kings, henry, had, some, rights, to, western, berry, but, in, 1176, announced, that, he, had, agreed, in, 1169, to, give, richard, s, fianc, e, alys, the, whole, province, as, part, of, the, marriage, settlement, if, louis, accepted, this, it, would, have, implied, that, berry, was, henry, s, to, give, away, in, the, first, place, and, would, have, given, henry, the, right, to, occupy, it, on, richard, s, behalf, to, put, additional, pressure, on, louis, henry, mobilised, his, armies, for, war, the, papacy, intervened, and, probably, as, henry, had, planned, the, two, kings, were, encouraged, to, sign, a, non, aggression, treaty, in, september, 1177, under, which, they, promised, to, undertake, a, joint, crusade, the, ownership, of, the, auvergne, and, parts, of, berry, were, put, to, an, arbitration, panel, which, reported, in, favour, of, henry, henry, followed, up, this, success, by, purchasing, la, marche, from, the, local, count, this, expansion, of, henry, s, empire, once, again, threatened, french, security, and, promptly, put, the, new, peace, at, risk, in, the, late, 1170s, henry, focused, on, trying, to, create, a, stable, system, of, government, increasingly, ruling, through, his, family, but, tensions, over, the, succession, arrangements, were, never, far, away, ultimately, leading, to, a, fresh, revolt, having, quelled, the, left, over, rebels, from, the, great, revolt, richard, was, recognised, by, henry, as, the, duke, of, aquitaine, in, 1179, in, 1181, geoffrey, finally, married, constance, of, brittany, and, became, duke, of, brittany, by, now, most, of, brittany, accepted, angevin, rule, and, geoffrey, was, able, to, deal, with, the, remaining, disturbances, on, his, own, john, had, spent, the, great, revolt, travelling, alongside, his, father, and, most, observers, now, began, to, regard, the, prince, as, henry, s, favourite, child, henry, began, to, grant, john, more, lands, mostly, at, various, nobles, expense, and, in, 1177, made, him, the, lord, of, ireland, meanwhile, young, henry, spent, the, end, of, the, decade, travelling, in, europe, taking, part, in, tournaments, and, playing, only, a, passing, role, in, either, government, or, henry, and, richard, s, military, campaigns, he, was, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, his, position, and, lack, of, power, by, 1182, young, henry, reiterated, his, previous, demands, he, wanted, to, be, granted, lands, for, example, the, duchy, of, normandy, which, would, allow, him, to, support, himself, and, his, household, with, dignity, henry, refused, but, agreed, to, increase, his, son, s, allowance, this, was, not, enough, to, placate, young, henry, with, trouble, clearly, brewing, henry, attempted, to, defuse, the, situation, by, insisting, that, richard, and, geoffrey, give, homage, to, young, henry, for, their, lands, richard, did, not, believe, that, young, henry, had, any, claim, over, aquitaine, and, refused, to, give, homage, henry, forced, richard, to, do, homage, but, young, henry, angrily, refused, to, accept, it, he, formed, an, alliance, with, some, of, the, disgruntled, barons, of, the, aquitaine, who, were, unhappy, with, richard, s, rule, and, geoffrey, sided, with, him, raising, a, mercenary, army, in, brittany, to, threaten, poitou, open, war, broke, out, in, 1183, and, henry, and, richard, led, a, joint, campaign, into, aquitaine, before, they, could, conclude, it, young, henry, caught, a, fever, and, died, bringing, a, sudden, end, to, the, rebellion, with, his, eldest, son, dead, henry, rearranged, the, plans, for, the, succession, richard, was, to, be, made, king, of, england, although, without, any, actual, power, until, the, death, of, his, father, geoffrey, would, have, to, retain, brittany, as, he, held, it, by, marriage, and, henry, s, favourite, son, john, would, become, the, duke, of, aquitaine, in, place, of, richard, richard, refused, to, give, up, aquitaine, he, was, deeply, attached, to, the, duchy, and, had, no, desire, to, exchange, this, role, for, the, meaningless, one, of, being, the, junior, king, of, england, henry, was, furious, and, ordered, john, and, geoffrey, to, march, south, and, retake, the, duchy, by, force, the, short, war, ended, in, stalemate, and, a, tense, family, reconciliation, at, westminster, in, england, at, the, end, of, 1184, henry, finally, got, his, own, way, in, early, 1185, by, bringing, eleanor, to, normandy, to, instruct, richard, to, obey, his, father, while, simultaneously, threatening, to, give, normandy, and, possibly, england, to, geoffrey, this, proved, enough, and, richard, finally, handed, over, the, ducal, castles, in, aquitaine, to, henry, meanwhile, john, s, first, expedition, to, ireland, in, 1185, was, not, a, success, ireland, had, only, recently, been, conquered, by, anglo, norman, forces, and, tensions, were, still, rife, between, henry, s, representatives, the, new, settlers, and, the, native, inhabitants, john, offended, the, local, irish, rulers, failed, to, make, allies, amongst, the, anglo, norman, settlers, began, to, lose, ground, militarily, against, the, irish, and, finally, returned, to, england, in, 1186, henry, was, about, to, return, john, to, ireland, once, again, when, news, came, that, geoffrey, had, died, in, a, tournament, at, paris, leaving, two, young, children, this, event, once, again, changed, the, balance, of, power, between, henry, and, his, remaining, sons, henry, s, relationship, with, his, two, surviving, heirs, was, fraught, the, king, had, great, affection, for, his, youngest, son, john, but, showed, little, warmth, towards, richard, and, indeed, seems, to, have, borne, him, a, grudge, after, their, argument, in, 1184, the, bickering, and, simmering, tensions, between, henry, and, richard, were, cleverly, exploited, by, the, new, french, king, philip, ii, augustus, who, had, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 1180, he, rapidly, demonstrated, that, he, could, be, an, assertive, calculating, and, manipulative, political, leader, initially, henry, and, philip, augustus, had, enjoyed, a, good, relationship, and, they, agreed, to, a, joint, alliance, even, though, this, cost, the, french, king, the, support, of, flanders, and, champagne, philip, augustus, regarded, geoffrey, as, a, close, friend, and, would, have, welcomed, him, as, a, successor, to, henry, with, the, death, of, geoffrey, the, relationship, between, henry, and, philip, augustus, broke, down, in, 1186, philip, augustus, demanded, that, he, be, given, the, duchy, of, brittany, and, custody, of, geoffrey, s, children, and, insisted, that, henry, order, richard, to, withdraw, from, toulouse, where, he, had, been, sent, with, an, army, to, apply, new, pressure, on, count, raymond, philip, augustus, s, uncle, philip, augustus, threatened, to, invade, normandy, if, this, did, not, happen, he, also, reopened, the, question, of, the, vexin, which, had, formed, part, of, margaret, s, dowry, several, years, before, henry, still, occupied, the, region, and, now, philip, augustus, insisted, that, henry, either, complete, the, long, agreed, richard, alys, marriage, or, return, the, widowed, margaret, s, dowry, philip, augustus, invaded, berry, and, henry, mobilised, a, large, army, which, confronted, the, french, at, ch, teauroux, before, papal, intervention, brought, a, truce, during, the, negotiations, philip, augustus, suggested, to, richard, that, they, should, ally, against, henry, marking, the, start, of, a, new, strategy, to, divide, the, father, and, son, philip, augustus, s, offer, coincided, with, a, crisis, in, the, levant, in, 1187, jerusalem, surrendered, to, the, egyptian, ruler, saladin, and, calls, for, a, new, crusade, swept, europe, richard, was, enthusiastic, and, announced, his, intention, to, join, the, crusade, and, henry, and, philip, augustus, announced, their, similar, intent, at, the, start, of, 1188, taxes, began, to, be, raised, and, plans, were, made, for, supplies, and, transport, richard, was, keen, to, start, his, crusade, but, was, forced, to, wait, for, henry, to, make, his, arrangements, in, the, meantime, richard, set, about, crushing, some, of, his, enemies, in, aquitaine, in, 1188, before, once, again, attacking, the, count, of, toulouse, richard, s, campaign, undermined, the, truce, between, henry, and, philip, augustus, and, both, sides, again, mobilised, large, forces, in, anticipation, of, war, this, time, henry, rejected, philip, augustus, s, offers, of, a, short, term, truce, in, the, hope, of, convincing, the, french, king, to, agree, to, a, long, term, peace, deal, philip, augustus, refused, to, consider, henry, s, proposals, a, furious, richard, believed, that, henry, was, stalling, for, time, and, delaying, the, departure, of, the, crusade, the, relationship, between, henry, and, richard, finally, descended, into, violence, shortly, before, henry, s, death, philip, held, a, peace, conference, in, november, 1188, making, a, public, offer, of, a, generous, long, term, peace, settlement, with, henry, conceding, to, his, various, territorial, demands, if, henry, would, finally, marry, richard, and, alys, and, announce, richard, as, his, recognised, heir, henry, refused, the, proposal, whereupon, richard, himself, spoke, up, demanding, to, be, recognised, as, henry, s, successor, henry, remained, silent, and, richard, then, publicly, changed, sides, at, the, conference, and, gave, formal, homage, to, philip, in, front, of, the, assembled, nobles, the, papacy, intervened, once, again, to, try, to, produce, a, last, minute, peace, deal, resulting, in, a, fresh, conference, at, la, fert, bernard, in, 1189, by, now, henry, was, suffering, from, a, bleeding, ulcer, that, ultimately, proved, fatal, the, discussions, achieved, little, although, henry, is, alleged, to, have, offered, philip, that, john, rather, than, richard, could, marry, alys, reflecting, the, rumours, circulating, over, the, summer, that, henry, was, considering, openly, disinheriting, richard, the, conference, broke, up, with, war, appearing, likely, but, philip, and, richard, launched, a, surprise, attack, immediately, afterwards, during, what, was, conventionally, a, period, of, truce, henry, was, caught, by, surprise, at, le, mans, but, made, a, forced, march, north, to, alen, on, from, where, he, could, escape, into, the, safety, of, normandy, suddenly, henry, turned, back, south, towards, anjou, against, the, advice, of, his, officials, the, weather, was, extremely, hot, the, king, was, increasingly, ill, and, he, appears, to, have, wanted, to, die, peacefully, in, anjou, rather, than, fight, yet, another, campaign, henry, evaded, the, enemy, forces, on, his, way, south, and, collapsed, in, his, castle, at, chinon, philip, and, richard, were, making, good, progress, not, least, because, it, was, now, obvious, that, henry, was, dying, and, that, richard, would, be, the, next, king, and, the, pair, offered, negotiations, they, met, at, ballan, where, henry, only, just, able, to, remain, seated, on, his, horse, agreed, to, a, complete, surrender, he, would, pay, homage, to, philip, he, would, give, up, alys, to, a, guardian, and, she, would, marry, richard, at, the, end, of, the, coming, crusade, he, would, recognise, richard, as, his, heir, he, would, pay, philip, compensation, and, key, castles, would, be, given, to, philip, as, a, guarantee, though, henry, had, been, defeated, and, forced, to, negotiate, the, terms, were, not, extravagant, and, nothing, changed, as, a, result, of, henry, s, submission, with, philip, and, richard, achieving, little, more, than, the, humiliation, of, a, dying, man, henry, was, carried, back, to, chinon, on, a, litter, where, he, was, informed, that, john, had, publicly, sided, with, richard, in, the, conflict, this, desertion, proved, the, final, shock, and, the, king, finally, collapsed, into, a, fever, regaining, consciousness, only, for, a, few, moments, during, which, he, made, a, sacramental, confession, he, died, on, 6, july, 1189, aged, 56, he, had, wished, to, be, interred, at, grandmont, abbey, in, the, limousin, but, the, hot, weather, made, transporting, his, body, impractical, and, he, was, instead, buried, at, the, nearby, fontevraud, abbey, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, henry, s, death, richard, successfully, claimed, his, father, s, lands, he, later, left, on, the, third, crusade, but, never, married, alys, as, he, had, agreed, with, philip, augustus, the, widowed, eleanor, was, released, from, house, arrest, and, regained, control, of, aquitaine, where, she, ruled, on, richard, s, behalf, henry, s, empire, did, not, survive, long, and, collapsed, during, the, reign, of, his, youngest, son, john, when, philip, captured, all, of, the, angevin, possessions, in, france, except, gascony, this, collapse, had, various, causes, including, long, term, changes, in, economic, power, growing, cultural, differences, between, england, and, normandy, the, military, shortcomings, of, king, john, but, in, particular, the, fragile, familial, nature, of, henry, s, empire, many, of, the, changes, henry, introduced, during, his, long, rule, had, major, long, term, consequences, his, legal, changes, are, generally, considered, to, have, laid, the, basis, for, english, common, law, the, exchequer, court, being, a, precursor, of, the, later, common, bench, at, westminster, henry, s, itinerant, justices, also, influenced, his, contemporaries, legal, reforms, philip, augustus, s, creation, of, itinerant, bailli, for, example, clearly, drew, on, the, henrician, model, henry, s, intervention, in, brittany, wales, and, scotland, also, had, a, long, term, impact, on, the, development, of, their, societies, and, governmental, systems, henry, was, widely, criticised, by, his, own, contemporaries, even, within, his, own, court, despite, this, gerald, of, wales, usually, unsympathetic, to, the, angevins, wrote, somewhat, flatteringly, of, henry, in, topographia, hibernica, as, our, alexander, of, the, west, who, extended, your, hand, from, the, pyrenees, to, the, westernmost, limits, of, the, ocean, william, of, newburgh, writing, in, the, next, generation, commented, that, the, experience, of, present, evils, has, revived, the, memory, of, his, good, deeds, and, the, man, who, in, his, own, time, was, hated, by, all, men, is, now, declared, to, have, been, an, excellent, and, beneficent, prince, henry, and, his, reign, have, attracted, historians, for, many, years, in, the, 18th, century, the, historian, david, hume, argued, that, henry, s, reign, was, pivotal, to, creating, a, genuinely, english, monarchy, and, ultimately, a, unified, britain, henry, s, role, in, the, becket, controversy, was, considered, relatively, praiseworthy, by, protestant, historians, of, the, 18th, century, while, his, disputes, with, the, french, king, also, attracted, positive, patriotic, comment, in, the, victorian, period, there, was, a, renewed, interest, in, the, personal, morality, of, historical, figures, and, scholars, began, to, express, greater, concern, over, aspects, of, henry, s, behaviour, including, his, role, as, a, parent, and, husband, the, king, s, role, in, the, death, of, becket, attracted, particular, criticism, late, victorian, historians, with, increasing, access, to, the, documentary, records, from, the, period, stressed, henry, s, contribution, to, the, evolution, of, key, english, institutions, including, the, development, of, the, law, and, the, exchequer, william, stubbs, analysis, led, him, to, label, henry, as, a, legislator, king, responsible, for, major, long, lasting, reforms, in, england, influenced, by, the, contemporary, growth, of, the, british, empire, historians, such, as, kate, norgate, undertook, detailed, research, into, henry, s, continental, possessions, creating, the, term, the, angevin, empire, in, the, 1880s, twentieth, century, historians, challenged, many, of, these, conclusions, in, the, 1950s, jacques, boussard, and, john, jolliffe, among, others, examined, the, nature, of, henry, s, empire, french, scholars, in, particular, analysed, the, mechanics, of, how, royal, power, functioned, during, this, period, the, anglocentric, aspects, of, many, histories, of, henry, were, challenged, from, the, 1980s, onwards, with, efforts, made, to, bring, together, british, and, french, historical, analysis, of, the, period, more, detailed, study, of, the, written, records, left, by, henry, has, cast, doubt, on, some, earlier, interpretations, robert, eyton, s, ground, breaking, 1878, work, tracing, henry, s, itinerary, through, deductions, from, the, pipe, rolls, for, example, has, been, criticised, as, being, too, uncertain, a, way, of, determining, location, or, court, attendance, although, many, more, of, henry, s, royal, charters, have, been, identified, the, task, of, interpreting, these, records, the, financial, information, in, the, pipe, rolls, and, wider, economic, data, from, the, reign, is, understood, to, be, more, challenging, than, once, thought, considerable, gaps, in, historical, analysis, of, henry, remain, especially, the, nature, of, his, rule, in, anjou, and, the, south, of, france, nevertheless, 20th, century, historians, have, generally, praised, henry, the, canadian, american, historian, and, medievalist, norman, cantor, called, henry, a, remarkable, man, undoubtedly, the, greatest, of, all, medieval, english, kings, an, extensive, biography, by, w, l, warren, attributes, henry, with, a, genius, for, efficient, sound, government
