afterwards, he, founded, the, order, of, the, dragon, to, fight, the, turks, and, secured, the, thrones, of, croatia, germany, and, bohemia, sigismund, was, one, of, the, driving, forces, behind, the, council, of, constance, 1414, 1418, that, ended, the, papal, schism, but, which, also, led, to, the, hussite, wars, that, dominated, the, later, period, of, his, life, in, 1433, sigismund, was, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, and, ruled, until, his, death, in, 1437, historian, thomas, brady, jr, remarks, that, sigismund, possessed, a, breadth, of, vision, and, a, sense, of, grandeur, unseen, in, a, german, monarch, since, the, thirteenth, century, he, realized, the, need, to, carry, out, reforms, of, the, empire, and, the, church, at, the, same, time, but, external, difficulties, self, inflicted, mistakes, and, the, extinction, of, the, luxembourg, male, line, made, this, vision, unfulfilled, later, the, habsburgs, would, inherit, this, mission, and, imperial, reform, was, carried, out, successfully, under, the, reigns, of, frederick, iii, and, especially, his, son, maximilian, i, although, perhaps, at, the, expense, of, the, reform, of, the, church, partly, because, maximilian, was, not, particularly, focused, on, the, matter, in, recent, years, scholarly, interest, especially, from, east, central, europe, has, grown, greatly, in, the, person, and, reign, of, sigismund, the, ruler, who, had, gained, and, led, an, imperial, association, almost, reaching, the, size, of, the, later, habsburg, empire, as, well, as, cultural, developments, associated, with, his, era, the, setbacks, which, have, been, seen, as, his, major, failures, like, dealing, with, the, hussite, movement, are, now, generally, considered, by, most, scholars, to, be, the, results, of, the, lack, of, financial, resources, and, other, heavy, constraints, rather, than, personal, failings, born, in, nuremberg, or, prague, sigismund, was, the, son, of, charles, iv, holy, roman, emperor, and, his, fourth, and, final, wife, elizabeth, of, pomerania, who, was, the, granddaughter, of, king, casimir, iii, of, poland, and, the, great, granddaughter, of, gediminas, a, grand, duke, of, lithuania, he, was, named, after, saint, sigismund, of, burgundy, the, favourite, saint, of, sigismund, s, father, from, sigismund, s, childhood, he, was, nicknamed, the, ginger, fox, li, ka, ry, av, in, the, bohemian, crown, lands, on, account, of, his, hair, colour, king, louis, the, great, of, hungary, and, poland, always, had, a, good, and, close, relationship, with, emperor, charles, iv, and, sigismund, was, betrothed, to, louis, eldest, daughter, mary, in, 1374, when, he, was, six, years, old, and, mary, but, an, infant, the, marital, project, aimed, to, augment, the, lands, held, by, the, house, of, luxembourg, upon, his, father, s, death, in, 1378, young, sigismund, became, margrave, of, brandenburg, and, was, sent, to, the, hungarian, court, where, he, soon, learned, the, hungarian, language, and, way, of, life, and, became, entirely, devoted, to, his, adopted, country, king, louis, named, him, as, his, heir, and, appointed, him, his, successor, as, king, of, hungary, in, 1381, the, then, 13, year, old, sigismund, was, sent, to, krak, w, by, his, eldest, half, brother, and, guardian, wenceslaus, king, of, germany, and, bohemia, to, learn, polish, and, to, become, acquainted, with, the, land, and, its, people, king, wenceslaus, also, gave, him, neumark, to, facilitate, communication, between, brandenburg, and, poland, while, mary, was, accepted, as, monarch, of, hungary, sigismund, vied, for, the, crown, of, poland, as, well, however, the, poles, were, unwilling, to, submit, to, a, german, sovereign, nor, did, they, want, to, be, tied, to, hungary, the, disagreement, between, polish, landlords, of, lesser, poland, on, one, side, and, landlords, of, greater, poland, on, the, other, regarding, the, choice, of, the, future, monarch, of, poland, finally, ended, in, choosing, the, lithuanian, side, the, support, of, the, lords, of, greater, poland, was, however, not, enough, to, give, prince, sigismund, the, polish, crown, instead, the, landlords, of, lesser, poland, gave, it, to, mary, s, younger, sister, jadwiga, who, married, jogaila, of, lithuania, on, the, death, of, her, father, in, 1382, his, betrothed, mary, became, queen, of, hungary, and, sigismund, married, her, in, 1385, in, z, lyom, today, zvolen, the, next, year, he, was, accepted, as, mary, s, future, co, ruler, by, the, treaty, of, gy, r, however, mary, was, captured, together, with, her, mother, elizabeth, of, bosnia, who, had, acted, as, regent, in, 1387, by, the, rebellious, house, of, horvat, bishop, paul, horvat, of, ma, va, his, brother, john, horvat, and, younger, brother, ladislav, sigismund, s, mother, in, law, was, strangled, while, mary, was, liberated, having, secured, the, support, of, the, nobility, sigismund, was, crowned, king, of, hungary, at, sz,

ceaseless, struggle, for, the, possession, of, this, unstable, throne, the, central, power, was, finally, weakened, to, such, an, extent, that, only, sigismund, s, alliance, with, the, powerful, czillei, garai, league, could, ensure, his, position, on, the, throne, it, was, not, for, entirely, selfless, reasons, that, one, of, the, leagues, of, barons, helped, him, to, power, sigismund, had, to, pay, for, the, support, of, the, lords, by, transferring, a, sizeable, part, of, the, royal, properties, for, some, years, the, baron, s, council, governed, the, country, in, the, name, of, the, holy, crown, the, restoration, of, the, authority, of, the, central, administration, took, decades, of, work, the, bulk, of, the, nation, headed, by, the, house, of, garai, was, with, him, but, in, the, southern, provinces, between, the, sava, and, the, drava, the, horvathys, with, the, support, of, king, tvrtko, i, of, bosnia, mary, s, maternal, uncle, proclaimed, as, their, king, ladislaus, of, naples, son, of, the, murdered, charles, ii, of, hungary, not, until, 1395, did, nicholas, ii, garai, succeed, in, suppressing, them, mary, died, heavily, pregnant, in, 1395, to, ease, the, pressure, from, hungarian, nobles, sigismund, tried, to, employ, foreign, advisors, which, was, not, popular, and, he, had, to, promise, not, to, give, land, and, nominations, to, anyone, other, than, hungarian, nobles, however, this, was, not, applied, to, stibor, of, stiboricz, who, was, sigismund, s, closest, friend, and, advisor, on, a, number, of, occasions, sigismund, was, imprisoned, by, nobles, but, with, the, help, of, the, armies, of, garai, and, stibor, of, stiboricz, he, was, able, to, regain, power, in, 1396, sigismund, led, the, combined, armies, of, christendom, against, the, turks, who, had, taken, advantage, of, the, temporary, helplessness, of, hungary, to, extend, their, dominion, to, the, banks, of, the, danube, this, crusade, preached, by, pope, boniface, ix, was, very, popular, in, hungary, the, nobles, flocked, in, their, thousands, to, the, royal, standard, and, were, reinforced, by, volunteers, from, nearly, every, part, of, europe, the, most, important, contingent, being, that, of, the, french, led, by, john, the, fearless, son, of, philip, ii, duke, of, burgundy, sigismund, set, out, with, 90, 000, men, and, a, flotilla, of, 70, galleys, after,

where, he, ordained, the, local, montenegrin, lord, ura, ii, with, the, islands, of, hvar, and, kor, ula, for, resistance, against, the, turks, the, islands, were, returned, to, sigismund, after, ura, s, death, in, april, 1403, the, disaster, at, nicopolis, angered, several, hungarian, lords, leading, to, instability, in, the, kingdom, deprived, of, his, authority, in, hungary, sigismund, then, turned, his, attention, to, securing, the, succession, in, germany, and, bohemia, and, was, recognized, by, his, childless, half, brother, wenceslaus, iv, as, vicar, general, of, the, whole, empire, however, he, was, unable, to, support, wenceslaus, when, he, was, deposed, in, 1400, and, rupert, of, germany, elector, palatine, was, elected, german, king, in, his, stead, on, his, return, to, hungary, in, 1401, sigismund, was, imprisoned, once, and, deposed, twice, that, year, he, aided, an, uprising, against, wenceslaus, iv, during, the, course, of, which, the, bohemian, king, was, taken, prisoner, and, sigismund, ruled, bohemia, for, nineteen, months, he, released, wenceslaus, in, 1403, in, the, meantime, a, group, of, hungarian, noblemen, swore, loyalty, to, the, last, anjou, monarch, ladislaus, of, naples, putting, their, hands, on, the, relic, of, saint, ladislas, of, hungary, in, nagyv, rad, today, oradea, ladislaus, was, the, son, of, the, murdered, charles, ii, of, hungary, and, thus, a, distant, relative, of, the, long, dead, king, louis, i, of, hungary, ladislaus, captured, zara, today, zadar, in, 1403, but, soon, stopped, any, military, advance, this, struggle, in, turn, led, to, a, war, with, the, republic, of, venice, as, ladislaus, had, sold, the, dalmatian, cities, to, the, venetians, for, 100, 000, ducats, before, leaving, for, his, own, land, in, the, following, years, sigismund, acted, indirectly, to, thwart, ladislaus, attempts, to, conquer, central, italy, by, allying, with, the, italian, cities, resisting, him, and, by, applying, diplomatic, pressure, on, him, due, to, his, frequent, absences, attending, to, business, in, the, other, countries, over, which, he, ruled, he, was, obliged, to, consult, diets, in, hungary, with, more, frequency, than, his, predecessors, and, institute, the, office, of, palatine, as, chief, administrator, while, he, was, away, in, 1404, sigismund, introduced, the, placetum, regium, according, to, this, decree, papal, bulls, could, not, be, pronounced, in, hungary, without, the, consent, of, the, king, during, his, long, reign, the, royal, buda, castle, became, probably, the, largest,

the, house, of, kotromanic, and, mary, s, mother, queen, elisabeth, of, bosnia, were, sisters, or, at, least, cousins, who, were, adoptive, sisters, sigismund, managed, to, establish, control, in, slavonia, he, did, not, hesitate, to, use, violent, methods, see, bloody, sabor, of, kri, evci, but, from, the, river, sava, to, the, south, his, control, was, weak, sigismund, personally, led, an, army, of, almost, 50, 000, crusaders, against, the, bosnians, culminating, with, the, battle, of, dobor, in, 1408, a, massacre, of, about, 200, members, of, various, bosnian, noble, families, however, although, campaign, militarily, looked, like, a, success, it, ultimately, failed, politically, and, hungarians, retreated, while, the, bosnian, crown, slowly, but, surely, slipped, away, out, of, the, reach, for, sigismund, and, hungarians, threatened, by, ottoman, expansion, king, sigismund, managed, to, strengthen, the, security, of, southern, hungarian, borders, by, entering, into, a, defensive, alliance, with, despot, stefan, lazarevi, of, serbia, in, 1403, hungarian, possessions, in, northwestern, regions, of, serbia, city, of, belgrade, and, the, banate, of, macs, were, given, to, despot,

allegiance, to, sigismund, returning, belgrade, to, the, king, by, maintaining, close, relations, with, serbian, rulers, sigismund, succeeded, in, securing, southern, borders, of, his, realm, sigismund, founded, his, personal, order, of, knights, the, order, of, the, dragon, after, the, victory, at, dobor, the, main, goal, of, the, order, was, fighting, the, ottoman, empire, members, of, the, order, were, mostly, his, political, allies, and, supporters, the, main, members, of, the, order, were, sigismund, s, close, allies, nicholas, ii, garay, hermann, ii, of, celje, stibor, of, stiboricz, and, pippo, spano, the, most, important, european, monarchs, became, members, of, the, order, he, encouraged, international, trade, by, abolishing, internal, duties, regulating, tariffs, on, foreign, goods, and, standardizing, weights, and, measures, throughout, the, country, after, the, death, of, king, rupert, of, germany, in, 1410, sigismund, ignoring, the, claims, of, his, half, brother, wenceslaus, was, elected, as, successor, by, three, of, the, electors, on, 20, september, 1410, but, he, was, opposed, by, his, cousin, jobst, of, moravia, who, had, been, elected, by, four, electors, in, a, different, election, on, 1, october, jobst, s, death, 18, january, 1411, removed, this, conflict, and, sigismund, was, again, elected, king, on, 21, july, 1411, his, coronation, was, deferred, until, 8, november, 1414, when, it, took, place, at, aachen, on, a, number, of, occasions, and, in, 1410, in, particular, sigismund, allied, himself, with, the, teutonic, knights, against, w, adys, aw, ii, of, poland, in, return, for, 300, 000, ducats, he, would, attack, poland, from, the, south, after, the, truce, on, st, john, s, day, 24, june, expired, sigismund, ordered, his, most, loyal, friend, stibor, of, stiboricz, to, set, up, the, attack, on, poland, stibor, of, stiboricz, was, of, polish, origin, and, from, the, main, line, of, the, powerful, clan, of, ostoja, that, had, also, been, against, choosing, jagiello, as, king, of, poland, with, the, support, of, sigismund, stibor, become, one, of, the, most, influential, men, in, late, medieval, europe, holding, titles, as, duke, of, transylvania, and, owning, about, 25, of, modern, day, slovakia, including, 31, castles, of, which, 15, were, situated, around, the, 406, km, long, v, h, river, with, surrounding, land, that, was, given, to, him, by, sigismund, in, the, diplomatic, struggle, to, prevent, war, between, poland, lithuania, which, was, supported, by, the, muscovites, and, the, teutonic, knights, sigismund, used, stibor, s, fine, diplomacy, to, gain, financially, the, polish, side, appointed, several, negotiators, and, most, of, them, were, also, from, the, clan, of, ostoja, distant, relations, of, the, stibors, however, those, family, meetings, could, not, prevent, the, war, and, an, alliance, of, twenty, two, western, states, formed, an, army, against, poland, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, in, july, 1410, stibor, attacked, then, nowy, s, cz, and, burned, it, to, the, ground, but, after, that, he, returned, with, his, army, back, to, the, beckov, castle, after, the, polish, lithuanian, victory, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, the, teutonic, knights, had, to, pay, a, huge, sum, of, silver, to, poland, as, reparation, and, again, through, diplomacy, of, his, friend, stibor, sigismund, was, able, to, borrow, all, this, silver, from, king, w, adys, aw, ii, of, poland, on, good, conditions, in, the, light, of, facts, about, the, diplomatic, work, of, stibor, and, the, clan, of, ostoja, that, was, following, the, politics, of, king, sigismund, one, can, question, whether, sigismund, actually, joined, the, anti, polish, alliance, in, 1412, a, knights, tournament, was, held, in, buda, hungary, this, was, also, a, conference, between, hungarian, king, sigismund, polish, king, wladyslaw, ii, and, bosnian, king, tvrtko, ii, 2000, knights, were, present, from, all,

ii, this, text, mentions, w, adys, aw, s, cousin, vytautas, grand, duke, of, lithuania, and, the, king, of, bosnia, usually, identified, as, tvrtko, ii, some, argue, convincingly, that, it, was, not, tvrtko, ii, but, stjepan, ostoja, who, visited, buda, at, that, time, besides, the, king, hrvoje, vuk, i, hrvatini, sandalj, hrani, kosa, a, and, pavle, radinovi, also, came, from, bosnia, and, from, serbia, the, despot, stefan, lazarevi, bringing, two, thousand, horses, from, austria, dukes, ernest, the, iron, and, albert, ii, later, successor, of, sigismund, also, took, part, in, the, buda, meeting, also, heinrich, von, plauen, the, grand, master, of, the, teutonic, order, stibor, of, stiboricz, nikola, ii, gorjanski, hermann, ii, count, of, celje, and, his, son, frederick, ii, count, of, krbava, karlo, kurjakovi, ivan, morovi, ban, of, machva, d, ugosz, reports, the, arrival, in, buda, of, the, envoys, of, the, jalal, al, din, khan, of, the, golden, horde, and, son, of, tokhtamysh, who, wanted, to, meet, w, adys, aw, ii, of, poland, jalal, al, din, was, an, ally, of, the, polish, and, lithuanian, rulers, in, their, fight, against, the, teutonic, order, and, according, to, some, reconstructions, of, the, events, sigismund, also, wanted, to, rely, on, the, tatars, against, the, ottoman, threat, a, narrative, source, from, l, beck, also, mentions, the, proceedings, in, buda, in, 1412, detmar, s, l, beckische, chronik, continued, for, the, period, of, 1400, to, 1413, the, continuation, also, gives, a, detailed, description, of, the, participants, at, the, buda, meeting, the, royal, meeting, was, accompanied, by, festivities, and, various, entertainments, at, the, tournament, a, knight, from, silesia, named, nemsche, and, a, page, from, austria, won, the, joust, a, polish, priest, and, chronicler, jan, d, ugosz, says, in, his, annales, seu, cronici, incliti, regni, poloniae, that, in, the, tournament, there, were, also, knights, from, bulgaria, probably, from, the, court, of, prince, fruzhin, sigismund, s, vasal, who, also, was, at, the, conference, from, 1412, to, 1423, sigismund, campaigned, against, the, republic, of, venice, in, italy, the, king, took, advantage, of, the, difficulties, of, antipope, john, xxiii, to, obtain, a, promise, that, a, council, should, be, called, in, constance, in, 1414, to, settle, the, western, schism, he, took, a, leading, part, in, the, deliberations, of, this, assembly, and, during, the, sittings, travelled, to, france, england, and, burgundy, in, a, vain, attempt, to, secure, the, abdication, of, the, three, rival, popes, the, council, ended, in, 1418, having, resolved, the, schism, and, of, great, consequence, to, sigismund, s, future, career, having, the, czech, religious, reformer, jan, hus, burned, at, the, stake, for, heresy, in, july, 1415, the, complicity, of, sigismund, in, the, death, of, hus, is, a, matter, of, controversy, he, had, granted, hus, a, safe, conduct, and, protested, against, his, imprisonment, and, hus, was, burned, during, sigismund, s, absence, when, at, one, point, during, the, council, a, cardinal, corrected, sigismund, s, latin, sigismund, replied, ego, sum, rex, romanus, et, super, grammaticam, i, am, king, of, the, romans, and, above, grammar, thomas, carlyle, nicknamed, sigismund, super, grammaticam, his, main, acts, during, these, years, were, an, alliance, with, england, against, france, and, a, failed, attempt, owing, to, the, hostility, of, the, princes, to, secure, peace, in, germany, by, a, league, of, the, towns, also, sigismund, awarded, brandenburg, which, he, had, recovered, after, jobst, s, death, to, frederick, of, hohenzollern, burgrave, of, nuremberg, in, 1415, this, step, made, the, house, of, hohenzollern, one, of, the, most, important, in, germany, sigismund, began, to, shift, his, alliance, from, france, to, england, after, the, french, defeat, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, which, he, was, also, controversially, absent, from, due, to, hosting, a, pseudo, council, in, perpignan, with, antipope, benedict, xiii, and, king, ferdinand, i, of, aragon, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, canterbury, on, 15, august, 1416, culminated, diplomatic, efforts, between, henry, v, of, england, and, sigismund, and, resulted, in, a, defensive, and, offensive, alliance, against, france, this, in, turn, led, the, way, to, the, resolution, of, the, papal, schism, the, close, relationship, that, developed, between, henry, v, and, sigismund, resulted, in, him, being, inducted, into, the, order, of, the, garter, in, 1419, the, death, of, wenceslaus, iv, left, sigismund, titular, king, of, bohemia, but, he, had, to, wait, for, seventeen, years, before, the, czech, estates, would, acknowledge, him, although, the, two, dignities, of, king, of, the, romans, and, king, of, bohemia, added, considerably, to, his, importance, and, indeed, made, him, the, nominal, temporal, head, of, christendom, they, conferred, no, increase, of, power, and, financially, embarrassed, him, it, was, only, as, king, of, hungary, that, he, had, succeeded, in, establishing, his, authority, and, in, doing, anything, for, the, order, and, good, government, of, the, land, entrusting, the, government, of, bohemia, to, sofia, of, bavaria, the, widow, of, wenceslaus, he, hastened, into, hungary, the, bohemians, who, distrusted, him, as, the, betrayer, of, hus, were, soon, in, arms, and, the, flame, was, fanned, when, sigismund, declared, his, intention, of, prosecuting, the, war, against, heretics, three, campaigns, against, the, hussites, ended, in, disaster, although, the, army, of, his, most, loyal, ally, stibor, of, stiboricz, and, later, his, son, stibor, of, beckov, could, hold, the, hussite, side, away, from, the, borders, of, the, kingdom, the, turks, were, again, attacking, hungary, at, the, 1422, diet, of, nuremberg, sigismund, and, german, territorial, princes, collaborated, to, organize, two, armies, against, the, hussite, rebels, the, first, army, was, sent, to, relieve, karl, tejn, which, was, under, a, hussite, siege, the, second, army, was, ordered, to, destroy, the, hussite, field, army, but, jan, i, ka, defeated, the, imperial, force, at, the, battle, of, kutn, hora, and, then, at, the, battle, of, n, meck, brod, these, two, unexpected, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, hussites, ended, the, first, imperial, and, catholic, attempt, to, crush, the, bohemian, heretic, rebellion, the, alliance, against, the, hussites, continued, to, develop, though, joined, by, upper, german, princes, and, cities, even, from, the, regions, furthest, from, bohemia, in, january, 1424, associative, activity, of, the, german, electors, led, to, the, union, einunge, of, bingen, within, which, the, rhenish, princes, were, joined, by, the, elector, of, saxony, and, sigismund, s, loyal, partner, margrave, frederick, of, brandenburg, and, mutual, assistance, adjudication, and, cooperation, in, the, face, of, the, hussite, threat, were, stipulated, sigismund, s, rule, in, germany, and, in, the, empire, in, general, was, hampered, by, his, complete, lack, of, hausmacht, domestic, power, within, the, kingdom, of, germany, his, rule, relied, on, key, allies, and, the, culture, of, associative, political, mechanisms, in, germany, duncan, hardy, remarks, that, both, the, local, and, the, trans, regional, dimensions, of, the, political, activity, displayed, by, the, sources, from, throughout, sigismund, s, reign, demonstrate, that, power, at, every, level, in, the, empire, was, exercised, and, mediated, through, the, customary, institutions, and, mechanisms, of, associative, political, culture, if, sigismund, enjoyed, considerable, successes, at, certain, junctures, it, was, not, in, spite, of, or, independently, from, these, institutions, and, mechanisms, but, precisely, because, he, devoted, considerable, energy, to, harnessing, associative, interactions, and, building, strategic, relationships, with, leading, actors, within, elite, networks, even, during, his, prolonged, absences, from, the, empire, s, core, lands, sigismund, was, able, to, make, use, of, these, partnerships, and, could, reasonably, expect, that, the, associative, activity, of, princes, nobles, and, towns, would, yield, results, as, indeed, they, did, in, the, form, of, large, scale, collective, activity, against, duke, frederick, iv, of, austria, tyrol, in, the, 1410, and, the, hussites, in, the, 1420, not, all, of, sigismund, s, projects, came, to, fruition, and, he, could, not, always, control, the, longer, term, outcomes, of, his, policies, but, the, notion, that, there, were, phases, of, an, empire, without, a, king, during, his, reign, clearly, does, not, stand, up, to, the, abundant, evidence, of, his, interactions, with, regional, clients, and, associations, at, the, same, time, the, somewhat, adulatory, view, that, has, developed, in, recent, years, of, sigismund, as, a, masterly, politician, can, be, tempered, by, the, evidence, that, it, was, often, felicitous, alliances, as, much, as, personal, skill, which, made, his, successes, possible, the, alliance, between, sigismund, and, his, two, key, allies, in, germany, namely, frederick, i, elector, of, brandenburg, and, albert, of, austria, who, became, his, son, in, law, and, heir, through, the, marriage, with, sigismund, s, only, daughter, elizabeth, of, luxembourg, started, the, rise, of, the, hohenzollerns, and, reboosted, the, habsburgs, who, returned, to, the, german, throne, and, also, inherited, the, connection, with, hungary, croatia, and, bohemia, from, sigismund, in, 1428, sigismund, led, another, campaign, against, the, turks, but, again, with, few, results, in, 1431, he, went, to, milan, where, on, 25, november, he, received, the, iron, crown, as, king, of, italy, after, which, he, remained, for, some, time, at, siena, negotiating, for, his, coronation, as, emperor, and, for, the, recognition, of, the, council, of, basel, by, pope, eugenius, iv, he, was, crowned, emperor, in, rome, on, 31, may, 1433, and, after, obtaining, his, demands, from, the, pope, returned, to, bohemia, where, he, was, recognized, as, king, in, 1436, though, his, power, was, little, more, than, nominal, shortly, after, he, was, crowned, pope, eugenius, began, attempts, to, create, a, new, anti, ottoman, alliance, this, was, sparked, by, an, albanian, revolt, against, the, ottomans, which, had, begun, in, 1432, in, 1435, sigismund, sent, fruzhin, a, bulgarian, nobleman, to, negotiate, an, alliance, with, the, albanians, he, also, sent, daud, a, pretender, to, the, ottoman, throne, in, early, 1436, however, following, the, defeat, of, the, rebels, in, 1436, plans, for, an, anti, ottoman, alliance, ended, sigismund, died, on, 9, december, 1437, at, znojmo, german, znaim, moravia, now, czech, republic, and, as, ordered, in, life, he, was, buried, at, nagyv, rad, hungary, today, oradea, romania, next, to, the, tomb, of, the, king, saint, ladislaus, i, of, hungary, who, was, the, ideal, of, the, perfect, monarch, warrior, and, christian, for, that, time, and, was, deeply, venerated, by, sigismund, by, his, second, wife, barbara, of, celje, he, left, an, only, daughter, elisabeth, of, luxembourg, who, was, married, to, albert, v, duke, of, austria, later, german, king, as, albert, ii, whom, sigismund, named, as, his, successor, as, he, left, no, sons, his, line, of, the, house, of, luxembourg, became, extinct, on, his, death, sigismund, married, twice, but, had, little, luck, in, securing, the, succession, to, his, crowns, each, of, his, two, marriages, resulted, in, the, birth, of, one, child, his, first, born, child, probably, a, son, was, born, prematurely, as, a, result, of, a, horse, riding, accident, suffered, by, queen, mary, of, hungary, when, she, was, well, advanced, in, pregnancy, mother, and, child, both, died, shortly, after, the, birth, in, the, hills, of, buda, on, 17, may, 1395, this, caused, a, deep, succession, crisis, because, sigismund, ruled, over, hungary, by, right, of, his, wife, and, although, he, managed, to, keep, his, power, the, crisis, lasted, until, his, second, marriage, to, barbara, of, celje, barbara, s, only, child, born, in, the, purple, on, 7, october, 1409, probably, in, the, castle, of, visegr, d, was, elisabeth, of, luxembourg, the, future, queen, consort, of, hungary, germany, and, bohemia, queen, barbara, was, unable, to, give, birth, to, any, further, issue, elizabeth, of, luxembourg, was, thus, the, only, surviving, legitimate, offspring, of, sigismund, sigismund, was, known, to, speak, fluent, hungarian, wore, hungarian, style, royal, clothes, and, even, grew, his, beard, in, the, hungarian, fashion, emperor, sigismund, in, terms, of, the, quality, of, his, face, and, the, greatness, of, his, stature, was, a, fairly, great, man, the, world, s, chief, creator, blessed, him, with, a, beautiful, face, curly, bluish, hair, and, a, gentle, look, he, wore, a, long, beard, out, of, his, attraction, to, the, hungarians, because, they, also, wore, long, beards, once, upon, a, time, he, also, spent, huge, amounts, of, money, during, his, reign, to, rebuild, the, gothic, castles, of, buda, and, visegr, d, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, ordering, the, transportation, of, materials, from, austria, and, bohemia, his, many, affairs, with, women, led, to, the, birth, of, several, legends, as, the, one, that, existed, decades, later, during, the, reign, of, the, king, matthias, corvinus, of, hungary, according, to, this, john, hunyadi, was, sigismund, s, illegitimate, son, sigismund, gave, a, ring, to, the, boy, s, mother, when, he, was, born, but, one, day, in, the, forest, a, raven, stole, it, from, her, and, the, ring, was, only, recovered, after, the, bird, was, hunted, down, it, is, said, that, this, incident, inspired, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, hunyadis, and, later, also, appeared, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, matthias, corvinus, sigismund, adopted, the, hungarian, reverence, for, saint, ladislaus, i, of, hungary, who, was, considered, to, be, an, ideal, christian, knight, at, that, time, he, went, on, pilgrimage, several, times, to, his, tomb, in, nagyv, rad, before, sigismund, died, in, znaim, moravia, he, ordered, to,

anonymous, author, and, referred, to, the, injustice, of, the, german, rulers, it, included, a, vision, of, sigismund, s, about, the, appearance, of, a, priest, king, frederick, as, well, as, plans,
