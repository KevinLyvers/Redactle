septimia, zenobia, palmyrene, aramaic, bat, zabbai, c, 240, c, 274, was, a, third, century, queen, of, the, palmyrene, empire, in, syria, many, legends, surround, her, ancestry, she, was, probably, not, a, commoner, and, she, married, the, ruler, of, the, city, odaenathus, her, husband, became, king, in, 260, elevating, palmyra, to, supreme, power, in, the, near, east, by, defeating, the, sasanian, empire, of, persia, and, stabilizing, the, roman, east, after, odaenathus, assassination, zenobia, became, the, regent, of, her, son, vaballathus, and, held, de, facto, power, throughout, his, reign, in, 270, zenobia, launched, an, invasion, that, brought, most, of, the, roman, east, under, her, sway, and, culminated, with, the, annexation, of, egypt, by, mid, 271, her, realm, extended, from, ancyra, central, anatolia, to, upper, egypt, although, she, remained, nominally, subordinate, to, rome, however, in, reaction, to, the, campaign, of, the, roman, emperor, aurelian, in, 272, zenobia, declared, her, son, emperor, and, assumed, the, title, of, empress, thus, declaring, palmyra, s, secession, from, rome, the, romans, were, victorious, after, heavy, fighting, the, empress, was, besieged, in, her, capital, and, captured, by, aurelian, who, exiled, her, to, rome, where, she, spent, the, remainder, of, her, life, zenobia, was, a, cultured, monarch, and, fostered, an, intellectual, environment, in, her, court, which, was, open, to, scholars, and, philosophers, she, was, tolerant, toward, her, subjects, and, protected, religious, minorities, the, empress, maintained, a, stable, administration, which, governed, a, multicultural, multiethnic, empire, zenobia, died, after, 274, and, many, tales, have, been, recorded, about, her, fate, her, rise, and, fall, have, inspired, historians, artists, and, novelists, and, she, is, a, patriotic, symbol, in, syria, zenobia, was, born, c, 240, 241, and, bore, the, gentilicium, surname, septimia, her, native, palmyrene, name, was, bat, zabbai, written, btzby, in, the, palmyrene, alphabet, an, aramaic, name, meaning, daughter, of, zabbai, such, compound, names, for, women, were, common, in, palmyra, where, the, element, bt, means, daughter, but, the, personal, name, that, follows, does, not, necessarily, denote, the, immediate, father, rather, referring, to, the, ancestor, of, the, family, in, greek, palmyra, s, diplomatic, and, second, language, used, in, many, palmyrene, inscriptions, she, used, the, name, zenobia, in, palmyra, when, written, in, greek, names, such, as, zabeida, zabdila, zabbai, or, zabda, were, often, transformed, into, zenobios, masculine, and, zenobia, feminine, the, element, zabbai, from, zenobia, s, native, name, means, gift, of, n, n, and, the, name, zenobia, translates, to, one, whose, life, derives, from, zeus, the, historian, victor, duruy, believed, that, the, queen, used, the, greek, name, as, a, translation, of, her, native, name, in, deference, to, her, greek, subjects, the, philologist, wilhelm, dittenberger, argued, that, the, name, bat, zabbai, underwent, a, detortum, twist, thus, resulting, in, the, name, zenobia, the, ninth, century, historian, al, tabari, in, his, highly, fictionalized, account, wrote, that, the, queen, s, name, was, na, ila, al, zabba, manichaean, sources, reporting, the, visit, of, the, apostle, addai, to, the, region, during, the, time, of, odaenathus, called, zenobia, queen, tadi, wife, of, kysr, caesar, the, name, given, to, zenobia, in, those, manichaean, writings, seems, to, derive, from, tadmor, palmyra, s, native, name, and, this, is, supported, by, the, coptic, acts, codex, where, zenobia, is, named, queen, thadmor, no, contemporary, statues, of, zenobia, have, been, found, in, palmyra, or, elsewhere, only, inscriptions, on, statues, bases, survive, indicating, that, a, statue, of, the, queen, once, stood, in, the, place, most, known, representations, of, zenobia, are, the, idealized, portraits, of, her, found, on, her, coins, sculptures, of, palmyrene, style, were, normally, impersonal, unlike, greek, and, roman, ones, a, statue, of, zenobia, in, this, style, would, have, given, an, idea, of, her, general, style, in, dress, and, jewelry, but, would, not, have, revealed, her, true, appearance, the, non, contemporary, historian, edward, gibbon, has, described, her, as, being, of, a, dark, complexion, and, considered, most, lovely, and, that, she, equalled, in, beauty, her, ancestor, cleopatra, british, scholar, william, wright, visited, palmyra, toward, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, a, vain, search, for, a, sculpture, of, the, queen, in, addition, to, archaeological, evidence, zenobia, s, life, was, recorded, in, different, ancient, sources, but, many, are, flawed, or, fabricated, the, historia, augusta, a, late, roman, collection, of, biographies, is, the, most, notable, albeit, unreliable, source, for, the, era, the, author, or, authors, of, the, historia, augusta, invented, many, events, and, letters, attributed, to, zenobia, in, the, absence, of, contemporary, sources, some, historia, augusta, accounts, are, corroborated, from, other, sources, and, are, more, credible, the, byzantine, chronicler, joannes, zonaras, is, considered, an, important, source, for, the, life, of, zenobia, palmyrene, society, was, an, amalgam, of, semitic, speaking, peoples, mostly, arabs, and, arameans, and, zenobia, cannot, be, identified, with, any, one, group, as, a, palmyrene, she, may, have, had, both, arab, and, aramean, ancestry, information, about, zenobia, s, ancestry, and, immediate, family, connections, is, scarce, and, contradictory, nothing, is, known, about, her, mother, and, her, father, s, identity, is, debated, manichaean, sources, mention, a, nafsha, sister, of, the, queen, of, palmyra, but, those, sources, are, confused, and, nafsha, may, refer, to, zenobia, herself, it, is, doubtful, that, zenobia, had, a, sister, apparently, not, a, commoner, zenobia, would, have, received, an, education, appropriate, for, a, noble, palmyrene, girl, the, historia, augusta, contains, details, of, her, early, life, although, their, veracity, is, dubious, according, to, the, historia, augusta, the, queen, s, hobby, as, a, child, was, hunting, and, in, addition, to, her, palmyrene, aramaic, mother, tongue, she, was, fluent, in, egyptian, and, greek, and, spoke, latin, when, she, was, about, fourteen, years, old, ca, 255, zenobia, became, the, second, wife, of, odaenathus, the, ras, lord, of, palmyra, noble, families, in, palmyra, often, intermarried, and, it, is, probable, that, zenobia, and, odaenathus, shared, some, ancestors, basing, their, suppositions, upon, archaeological, evidence, various, historians, have, suggested, several, men, as, zenobia, s, father, julius, aurelius, zenobius, appears, on, a, palmyrene, inscription, as, a, strategos, of, palmyra, in, 231, 232, based, on, the, similarity, of, the, names, zenobius, was, suggested, as, zenobia, s, father, by, the, numismatist, alfred, von, sallet, and, others, the, archaeologist, william, waddington, argued, in, favor, of, zenobius, identification, as, the, father, assuming, that, his, statue, stood, opposite, to, where, the, statue, of, the, queen, stood, in, great, colonnade, however, the, linguist, jean, baptiste, chabot, pointed, out, that, zenobius, statue, stood, opposite, to, that, of, odaenathus, not, zenobia, and, rejected, waddington, s, hypothesis, the, only, gentilicium, a, hereditary, name, borne, by, people, that, was, originally, the, name, of, one, s, gens, family, or, clan, by, patrilineal, descent, appearing, on, zenobia, s, inscriptions, was, septimia, not, julia, aurelia, which, she, would, have, borne, if, her, father, s, gentilicium, was, aurelius, and, it, cannot, be, proven, that, the, queen, changed, her, gentilicium, to, septimia, after, her, marriage, one, of, zenobia, s, inscriptions, recorded, her, as, septimia, bat, zabbai, daughter, of, antiochus, antiochus, identity, is, not, definitively, known, his, ancestry, is, not, recorded, in, palmyrene, inscriptions, and, the, name, was, not, common, in, palmyra, this, combined, with, the, meaning, of, zenobia, s, palmyrene, name, daughter, of, zabbai, led, scholars, such, as, harald, ingholt, to, speculate, that, antiochus, might, have, been, a, distant, ancestor, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, or, antiochus, vii, sidetes, whose, wife, was, the, ptolemaic, cleopatra, thea, in, the, historian, richard, stoneman, s, view, zenobia, would, not, have, created, an, obscure, ancestry, to, connect, herself, with, the, ancient, macedonian, rulers, if, a, fabricated, ancestry, were, needed, a, more, direct, connection, would, have, been, invented, according, to, stoneman, zenobia, had, reason, to, believe, to, be, true, the, historian, patricia, southern, noting, that, antiochus, was, mentioned, without, a, royal, title, or, a, hint, of, great, lineage, believes, that, he, was, a, direct, ancestor, or, a, relative, rather, than, a, seleucid, king, who, lived, three, centuries, before, zenobia, on, the, basis, of, zenobia, s, palmyrene, name, bat, zabbai, her, father, may, have, been, called, zabbai, alternatively, zabbai, may, have, been, the, name, of, a, more, distant, ancestor, the, historian, trevor, bryce, suggests, that, she, was, related, to, septimius, zabbai, palmyra, s, garrison, leader, and, he, may, even, have, been, her, father, the, archaeologist, charles, simon, clermont, ganneau, attempting, to, reconcile, the, meaning, of, the, name, bat, zabbai, with, the, inscription, mentioning, the, queen, as, daughter, of, antiochus, suggested, that, two, brothers, zabbai, and, antiochus, existed, with, a, childless, zabbai, dying, and, leaving, his, widow, to, marry, his, brother, antiochus, thus, since, zenobia, was, born, out, of, a, levirate, marriage, she, was, theoretically, the, daughter, of, zabbai, hence, the, name, in, the, historia, augusta, zenobia, is, said, to, have, been, a, descendant, of, cleopatra, and, claimed, descent, from, the, ptolemies, according, to, the, souda, a, 10th, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, after, the, palmyrene, conquest, of, egypt, the, sophist, callinicus, of, petra, wrote, a, ten, volume, history, of, alexandria, dedicated, to, cleopatra, according, to, modern, scholars, by, cleopatra, callinicus, meant, zenobia, apart, from, legends, there, is, no, direct, evidence, in, egyptian, coinage, or, papyri, of, a, contemporary, conflation, of, zenobia, with, cleopatra, the, connection, may, have, been, invented, by, zenobia, s, enemies, to, discredit, her, but, circumstantial, evidence, indicates, that, zenobia, herself, made, the, claim, an, imperial, declaration, once, ascribed, to, emperor, severus, alexander, died, 235, was, probably, made, by, zenobia, in, the, name, of, her, son, vaballathus, where, the, king, named, alexandria, my, ancestral, city, which, indicates, a, claim, to, ptolemaic, ancestry, zenobia, s, alleged, claim, of, a, connection, to, cleopatra, seems, to, have, been, politically, motivated, since, it, would, have, given, her, a, connection, with, egypt, and, made, her, a, legitimate, successor, to, the, ptolemies, throne, a, relationship, between, zenobia, and, the, ptolemies, is, unlikely, and, attempts, by, classical, sources, to, trace, the, queen, s, ancestry, to, the, ptolemies, through, the, seleucids, are, apocryphal, although, some, arab, historians, linked, zenobia, to, the, queen, of, sheba, their, accounts, are, apocryphal, medieval, arabic, traditions, identify, a, queen, of, palmyra, named, al, zabba, and, her, most, romantic, account, comes, from, al, tabari, according, to, al, tabari, she, was, an, amalekite, her, father, was, amr, ibn, zarib, an, am, l, q, sheikh, who, was, killed, by, the, tanukhids, al, tabari, identifies, a, sister, of, al, zabba, as, zabibah, jadhimah, ibn, malik, the, tanukhid, king, who, killed, the, queen, s, father, was, killed, by, al, zabba, according, to, al, tabari, al, zabba, had, a, fortress, along, the, euphrates, and, ruled, palmyra, al, tabari, s, account, does, not, mention, the, romans, odaenathus, vaballathus, or, the, sassanians, focusing, on, the, tribes, and, their, relations, it, is, immersed, in, legends, although, the, account, is, certainly, based, on, the, story, of, zenobia, it, is, probably, conflated, with, the, story, of, a, semi, legendary, nomadic, arab, queen, or, queens, al, zabba, s, fortress, was, probably, halabiye, which, was, restored, by, the, historic, palmyrene, queen, and, named, zenobia, during, the, early, centuries, ad, palmyra, was, a, city, subordinate, to, rome, and, part, of, the, province, of, syria, phoenice, in, 260, the, roman, emperor, valerian, marched, against, the, sassanid, persian, monarch, shapur, i, who, had, invaded, the, empire, s, eastern, regions, valerian, was, defeated, and, captured, near, edessa, odaenathus, formally, loyal, to, rome, and, its, emperor, gallienus, valerian, s, son, was, declared, king, of, palmyra, launching, successful, campaigns, against, persia, he, was, crowned, king, of, kings, of, the, east, in, 263, odaenathus, crowned, his, eldest, son, herodianus, as, co, ruler, in, addition, to, the, royal, titles, odaenathus, received, many, roman, titles, most, importantly, corrector, totius, orientis, governor, of, the, entire, east, and, ruled, the, roman, territories, from, the, black, sea, to, palestine, in, 267, when, zenobia, was, in, her, late, twenties, or, early, thirties, odaenathus, and, his, eldest, son, were, assassinated, while, returning, from, a, campaign, the, first, inscription, mentioning, zenobia, as, queen, is, dated, two, or, three, years, after, odaenathus, death, so, exactly, when, zenobia, assumed, the, title, queen, of, palmyra, is, uncertain, however, she, was, probably, designated, as, queen, when, her, husband, became, king, as, queen, consort, zenobia, remained, in, the, background, and, was, not, mentioned, in, the, historical, record, according, to, later, accounts, including, one, by, giovanni, boccaccio, she, accompanied, her, husband, on, his, campaigns, if, the, accounts, of, her, accompanying, her, husband, are, true, according, to, southern, zenobia, would, have, boosted, the, morale, of, the, soldiers, and, gained, political, influence, which, she, needed, in, her, later, career, according, to, the, historia, augusta, odaenathus, was, assassinated, by, a, cousin, named, maeonius, in, the, historia, augusta, odaenathus, son, from, his, first, wife, was, named, herodes, and, was, crowned, co, ruler, by, his, father, the, historia, augusta, claims, that, zenobia, conspired, with, maeonius, for, a, time, because, she, did, not, accept, her, stepson, as, his, father, s, heir, ahead, of, her, own, children, the, historia, augusta, does, not, suggest, that, zenobia, was, involved, in, the, events, leading, to, her, husband, s, murder, and, the, crime, is, attributed, to, maeonius, moral, degeneration, and, jealousy, this, account, according, to, the, historian, alaric, watson, can, be, dismissed, as, fictional, although, some, modern, scholarship, suggests, that, zenobia, was, involved, in, the, assassination, due, to, political, ambition, and, opposition, to, her, husband, s, pro, roman, policy, she, continued, odaenathus, policies, during, her, first, years, on, the, throne, in, the, historia, augusta, maeonius, was, emperor, briefly, before, he, was, killed, by, his, soldiers, however, no, inscriptions, or, evidence, exist, for, his, reign, at, the, time, of, odaenathus, assassination, zenobia, might, have, been, with, her, husband, according, to, chronicler, george, syncellus, he, was, killed, near, heraclea, pontica, in, bithynia, the, transfer, of, power, seems, to, have, been, smooth, since, syncellus, reports, that, the, time, from, the, assassination, to, the, army, handing, the, crown, to, zenobia, was, one, day, zenobia, may, have, been, in, palmyra, but, this, would, have, reduced, the, likelihood, of, a, smooth, transition, the, soldiers, might, have, chosen, one, of, their, officers, so, the, first, scenario, of, her, being, with, her, husband, is, more, likely, the, historical, records, are, unanimous, that, zenobia, did, not, fight, for, supremacy, and, there, is, no, evidence, of, delay, in, the, transfer, of, the, throne, to, odaenathus, and, zenobia, s, son, the, ten, year, old, vaballathus, although, she, never, claimed, to, rule, in, her, own, right, and, acted, as, a, regent, for, her, son, zenobia, held, the, reins, of, power, in, the, kingdom, and, vaballathus, was, kept, in, his, mother, s, shadow, never, exercising, real, power, the, palmyrene, monarchy, was, new, allegiance, was, based, on, loyalty, to, odaenathus, making, the, transfer, of, power, to, a, successor, more, difficult, than, it, would, have, been, in, an, established, monarchy, odaenathus, tried, to, ensure, the, dynasty, s, future, by, crowning, his, eldest, son, co, king, but, both, were, assassinated, zenobia, left, to, secure, the, palmyrene, succession, and, retain, the, loyalty, of, its, subjects, emphasized, the, continuity, between, her, late, husband, and, his, successor, her, son, vaballathus, with, zenobia, orchestrating, the, process, assumed, his, father, s, royal, titles, immediately, and, his, earliest, known, inscription, records, him, as, king, of, kings, odaenathus, controlled, a, large, area, of, the, roman, east, and, held, the, highest, political, and, military, authority, in, the, region, superseding, that, of, the, roman, provincial, governors, his, self, created, status, was, formalized, by, emperor, gallienus, who, had, little, choice, but, to, acquiesce, odaenathus, s, power, relative, to, that, of, the, emperor, and, the, central, authority, was, unprecedented, and, elastic, but, relations, remained, smooth, until, his, death, his, assassination, meant, that, the, palmyrene, rulers, authority, and, position, had, to, be, clarified, which, led, to, a, conflict, over, their, interpretation, the, roman, court, viewed, odaenathus, as, an, appointed, roman, official, who, derived, his, power, from, the, emperor, but, the, palmyrene, court, saw, his, position, as, hereditary, this, conflict, was, the, first, step, on, the, road, to, war, between, rome, and, palmyra, odaenathus, roman, titles, such, as, dux, romanorum, corrector, totius, orientis, and, imperator, totius, orientis, differed, from, his, royal, eastern, ones, because, the, roman, ranks, were, not, hereditary, vaballathus, had, a, legitimate, claim, to, his, royal, titles, but, had, no, right, to, the, roman, ones, especially, corrector, denoting, a, senior, military, and, provincial, commander, in, the, roman, system, which, zenobia, used, for, her, son, in, his, earliest, known, inscriptions, with, king, of, kings, although, the, roman, emperors, accepted, the, royal, succession, the, assumption, of, roman, military, rank, antagonized, the, empire, emperor, gallienus, may, have, decided, to, intervene, in, an, attempt, to, regain, central, authority, according, to, the, historia, augusta, praetorian, prefect, aurelius, heraclianus, was, dispatched, to, assert, imperial, authority, over, the, east, and, was, repelled, by, the, palmyrene, army, the, account, is, doubtful, however, since, heraclianus, participated, in, gallienus, assassination, in, 268, odaenathus, was, assassinated, shortly, before, the, emperor, and, heraclianus, would, have, been, unable, to, be, sent, to, the, east, fight, the, palmyrenes, and, return, to, the, west, in, time, to, become, involved, in, the, conspiracy, against, the, emperor, the, extent, of, zenobia, s, territorial, control, during, her, early, reign, is, debated, according, to, the, historian, fergus, millar, her, authority, was, confined, to, palmyra, and, emesa, until, 270, if, this, was, the, case, the, events, of, 270, which, saw, zenobia, s, conquest, of, the, levant, and, egypt, are, extraordinary, it, is, more, likely, that, the, queen, ruled, the, territories, controlled, by, her, late, husband, a, view, supported, by, southern, and, the, historian, udo, hartmann, and, backed, by, ancient, sources, such, as, the, roman, historian, eutropius, who, wrote, that, the, queen, inherited, her, husband, s, power, the, historia, augusta, also, mentioned, that, zenobia, took, control, of, the, east, during, gallienus, reign, further, evidence, of, extended, territorial, control, was, a, statement, by, the, byzantine, historian, zosimus, who, wrote, that, the, queen, had, a, residence, in, antioch, there, is, no, recorded, unrest, against, the, queen, accompanying, her, ascendance, in, ancient, sources, hostile, to, her, indicating, no, serious, opposition, to, the, new, regime, the, most, obvious, candidates, for, opposition, were, the, roman, provincial, governors, but, the, sources, do, not, say, that, zenobia, marched, on, any, of, them, or, that, they, tried, to, remove, her, from, the, throne, according, to, hartmann, the, governors, and, military, leaders, of, the, eastern, provinces, apparently, acknowledged, and, supported, vaballathus, as, the, successor, of, odaenathus, during, zenobia, s, early, regency, she, focused, on, safeguarding, the, borders, with, persia, and, pacifying, the, tanukhids, in, hauran, to, protect, the, persian, borders, the, queen, fortified, many, settlements, on, the, euphrates, including, the, citadels, of, halabiye, later, called, zenobia, and, zalabiye, circumstantial, evidence, exists, for, confrontations, with, the, sassanid, persians, probably, in, 269, vaballathus, assumed, the, victory, title, of, persicus, maximus, the, great, victor, in, persia, this, may, be, connected, to, an, unrecorded, battle, against, a, persian, army, trying, to, control, northern, mesopotamia, in, 269, while, claudius, gothicus, gallienus, successor, was, defending, the, borders, of, italy, and, the, balkans, against, germanic, invasions, zenobia, was, cementing, her, authority, roman, officials, in, the, east, were, caught, between, loyalty, to, the, emperor, and, zenobia, s, increasing, demands, for, allegiance, the, timing, and, rationale, of, the, queen, s, decision, to, use, military, force, to, strengthen, her, authority, in, the, east, is, unclear, scholar, gary, k, young, suggested, that, roman, officials, refused, to, recognize, palmyrene, authority, and, zenobia, s, expeditions, were, intended, to, maintain, palmyrene, dominance, another, factor, may, have, been, the, weakness, of, roman, central, authority, and, its, corresponding, inability, to, protect, the, provinces, which, probably, convinced, zenobia, that, the, only, way, to, maintain, stability, in, the, east, was, to, control, the, region, directly, the, historian, jacques, schwartz, tied, zenobia, s, actions, to, her, desire, to, protect, palmyra, s, economic, interests, which, were, threatened, by, rome, s, failure, to, protect, the, provinces, also, according, to, schwartz, the, economic, interests, conflicted, bostra, and, egypt, received, trade, which, would, have, otherwise, passed, through, palmyra, the, tanukhids, near, bostra, and, the, merchants, of, alexandria, probably, attempted, to, rid, themselves, of, palmyrene, domination, triggering, a, military, response, from, zenobia, in, the, spring, of, 270, while, claudius, was, fighting, the, goths, in, the, mountains, of, thrace, zenobia, sent, her, general, septimius, zabdas, to, bosra, capital, of, the, province, of, arabia, petraea, the, queen, s, timing, seems, intentional, in, arabia, the, roman, governor, dux, trassus, commanding, the, legio, iii, cyrenaica, confronted, the, palmyrenes, and, was, routed, and, killed, zabdas, sacked, the, city, and, destroyed, the, temple, of, zeus, hammon, the, legion, s, revered, shrine, a, latin, inscription, after, the, fall, of, zenobia, attests, to, its, destruction, the, temple, of, iuppiter, hammon, destroyed, by, the, palmyrene, enemies, which, rebuilt, with, a, silver, statue, and, iron, doors, the, city, of, umm, el, jimal, may, have, also, been, destroyed, by, the, palmyrenes, in, connection, with, their, efforts, to, subjugate, the, tanukhids, after, his, victory, zabdas, marched, south, along, the, jordan, valley, and, apparently, met, little, opposition, there, is, evidence, that, petra, was, attacked, by, a, small, contingent, which, penetrated, the, region, arabia, and, judaea, were, eventually, subdued, palmyrene, dominance, of, arabia, is, confirmed, by, many, milestones, bearing, vaballathus, name, syrian, subjugation, required, less, effort, because, zenobia, had, substantial, support, there, particularly, in, antioch, syria, s, traditional, capital, the, invasion, of, arabia, coincided, with, the, cessation, of, coin, production, in, claudius, name, by, the, antiochean, mint, indicating, that, zenobia, had, begun, tightening, her, grip, on, syria, by, november, 270, the, mint, began, issuing, coinage, in, vaballathus, name, the, arabian, milestones, presented, the, palmyrene, king, as, a, roman, governor, and, commander, referring, to, him, as, vir, clarissimus, rex, consul, imperator, dux, romanorum, the, assumption, of, such, titles, was, probably, meant, to, legitimize, zenobia, s, control, of, the, province, not, yet, a, usurpation, of, the, imperial, title, until, now, zenobia, could, say, that, she, was, acting, as, a, representative, of, the, emperor, who, was, securing, the, eastern, lands, of, the, empire, while, the, roman, monarch, was, preoccupied, with, struggles, in, europe, although, vaballathus, use, of, the, titles, amounted, to, a, claim, to, the, imperial, throne, zenobia, could, still, justify, them, and, maintain, a, mask, of, subordination, to, rome, an, imperator, was, a, commander, of, troops, not, the, equal, of, an, emperor, imperator, caesar, the, invasion, of, egypt, is, sometimes, explained, by, zenobia, s, desire, to, secure, an, alternative, trade, route, to, the, euphrates, which, was, cut, because, of, the, war, with, persia, this, theory, ignores, the, fact, that, the, euphrates, route, was, only, partially, disrupted, and, overlooks, zenobia, s, ambition, the, date, of, the, campaign, is, uncertain, zosimus, placed, it, after, the, battle, of, naissus, and, before, claudius, death, which, sets, it, in, the, summer, of, 270, watson, emphasizing, the, works, of, zonaras, and, syncellus, and, dismissing, zosimus, account, places, the, invasion, in, october, 270, after, claudius, death, according, to, watson, the, occupation, of, egypt, was, an, opportunistic, move, by, zenobia, who, was, encouraged, by, the, news, of, claudius, death, in, august, zenobia, was, declared, queen, of, egypt, after, palmyrene, invasion, of, egypt, the, appearance, of, the, palmyrenes, on, egypt, s, eastern, frontier, would, have, contributed, to, unrest, in, the, province, whose, society, was, fractured, zenobia, had, supporters, and, opponents, among, local, egyptians, the, roman, position, was, worsened, by, the, absence, of, egypt, s, prefect, tenagino, probus, who, was, battling, pirates, according, to, zosimus, the, palmyrenes, were, helped, by, an, egyptian, general, named, timagenes, zabdas, moved, into, egypt, with, 70, 000, soldiers, defeating, an, army, of, 50, 000, romans, after, their, victory, the, palmyrenes, withdrew, their, main, force, and, left, a, 5, 000, soldier, garrison, by, early, november, tenagino, probus, returned, and, assembled, an, army, he, expelled, the, palmyrenes, and, regained, alexandria, prompting, zabdas, to, return, the, palmyrene, general, aimed, a, thrust, at, alexandria, where, he, seems, to, have, had, local, support, the, city, fell, into, zabdas, hands, and, the, roman, prefect, fled, south, the, last, battle, was, at, the, babylon, fortress, where, tenagino, probus, took, refuge, the, romans, had, the, upper, hand, since, they, chose, their, camp, carefully, timagenes, with, his, knowledge, of, the, land, ambushed, the, roman, rear, tenagino, probus, committed, suicide, and, egypt, became, part, of, palmyra, in, the, historia, augusta, the, blemmyes, were, among, zenobia, s, allies, and, gary, k, young, cites, the, blemmyes, attack, and, occupation, of, coptos, in, 268, as, evidence, of, a, palmyrene, blemmyes, alliance, only, zosimus, mentioned, two, invasions, contrasting, with, many, scholars, who, argue, in, favor, of, an, initial, invasion, and, no, retreat, followed, by, a, reinforcement, which, took, alexandria, by, the, end, of, 270, during, the, egyptian, campaign, rome, was, entangled, in, a, succession, crisis, between, claudius, brother, quintillus, and, the, general, aurelian, egyptian, papyri, and, coinage, confirm, palmyrene, rule, in, egypt, the, papyri, stopped, using, the, regnal, years, of, the, emperors, from, september, to, november, 270, due, to, the, succession, crisis, by, december, regnal, dating, was, resumed, with, the, papyri, using, the, regnal, years, of, the, prevailing, emperor, aurelian, and, zenobia, s, son, vaballathus, egyptian, coinage, was, issued, in, the, names, of, aurelian, and, the, palmyrene, king, by, november, 270, there, is, no, evidence, that, zenobia, ever, visited, egypt, although, the, operation, may, have, commenced, under, septimius, zabbai, zabdas, second, in, command, the, invasion, of, asia, minor, did, not, fully, begin, until, zabdas, arrival, in, the, spring, of, 271, the, palmyrenes, annexed, galatia, and, according, to, zosimus, reached, ancyra, bithynia, and, the, cyzicus, mint, remained, beyond, zenobia, s, control, and, her, attempts, to, subdue, chalcedon, failed, the, asia, minor, campaign, is, poorly, documented, but, the, western, part, of, the, region, did, not, become, part, of, the, queen, s, authority, no, coins, with, zenobia, or, vaballathus, portraits, were, minted, in, asia, minor, and, no, royal, palmyrene, inscriptions, have, been, found, by, august, 271, zabdas, was, back, in, palmyra, with, the, palmyrene, empire, at, its, zenith, zenobia, ruled, an, empire, of, different, peoples, as, a, palmyrene, she, was, accustomed, to, dealing, with, multilingual, and, multicultural, diversity, since, she, hailed, from, a, city, which, embraced, many, cults, the, queen, s, realm, was, culturally, divided, into, eastern, semitic, and, hellenistic, zones, zenobia, tried, to, appease, both, and, seems, to, have, successfully, appealed, to, the, region, s, ethnic, cultural, and, political, groups, the, queen, projected, an, image, of, a, syrian, monarch, a, hellenistic, queen, and, a, roman, empress, which, gained, broad, support, for, her, cause, zenobia, turned, her, court, into, a, center, of, learning, with, many, intellectuals, and, sophists, reported, in, palmyra, during, her, reign, as, academics, migrated, to, the, city, it, replaced, classical, learning, centers, such, as, athens, for, syrians, the, best, known, court, philosopher, was, longinus, who, arrived, during, odaenathus, reign, and, became, zenobia, s, tutor, in, paideia, aristocratic, education, many, historians, including, zosimus, accused, longinus, of, influencing, the, queen, to, oppose, rome, this, view, presents, the, queen, as, malleable, but, according, to, southern, zenobia, s, actions, cannot, be, laid, entirely, at, longinus, door, other, intellectuals, associated, with, the, court, included, nicostratus, of, trapezus, and, callinicus, of, petra, from, the, second, to, the, fourth, centuries, syrian, intellectuals, argued, that, greek, culture, did, not, evolve, in, greece, but, was, adapted, from, the, near, east, according, to, iamblichus, the, great, greek, philosophers, reused, near, eastern, and, egyptian, ideas, the, palmyrene, court, was, probably, dominated, by, this, school, of, thought, with, an, intellectual, narrative, presenting, palmyra, s, dynasty, as, a, roman, imperial, one, succeeding, the, persian, seleucid, and, ptolemaic, rulers, who, controlled, the, region, in, which, hellenistic, culture, allegedly, originated, nicostratus, wrote, a, history, of, the, roman, empire, from, philip, the, arab, to, odaenathus, presenting, the, latter, as, a, legitimate, imperial, successor, and, contrasting, his, successes, with, the, disastrous, reigns, of, the, emperors, zenobia, embarked, on, several, restoration, projects, in, egypt, one, of, the, colossi, of, memnon, was, reputed, in, antiquity, to, sing, the, sound, was, probably, due, to, cracks, in, the, statue, with, solar, rays, interacting, with, dew, in, the, cracks, the, historian, glen, bowersock, proposed, that, the, queen, restored, the, colossus, silencing, it, which, would, explain, third, century, accounts, of, the, singing, and, their, disappearance, in, the, fourth, zenobia, followed, the, palmyrene, paganism, where, a, number, of, semitic, gods, with, bel, at, the, head, of, the, pantheon, were, worshipped, zenobia, accommodated, christians, and, jews, and, ancient, sources, made, many, claims, about, the, queen, s, beliefs, manichaean, sources, alleged, that, zenobia, was, one, of, their, own, a, manuscript, dated, to, 272, mentions, that, the, queen, of, palmyra, supported, the, manichaeans, in, establishing, a, community, in, abidar, which, was, under, the, rule, of, a, king, named, amar, who, could, be, the, lakhmid, king, amr, ibn, adi, it, is, more, likely, however, that, zenobia, tolerated, all, cults, in, an, effort, to, attract, support, from, groups, marginalized, by, rome, bishop, athanasius, of, alexandria, wrote, that, zenobia, did, not, hand, over, churches, to, the, jews, to, make, them, into, synagogues, although, the, queen, was, not, a, christian, she, understood, the, power, of, bishops, in, christian, communities, in, antioch, considered, representative, of, political, control, of, the, east, and, containing, a, large, christian, community, zenobia, apparently, maintained, authority, over, the, church, by, bringing, influential, clerics, probably, including, paul, of, samosata, under, her, auspices, she, may, have, bestowed, on, paul, the, rank, of, ducenarius, minor, judge, he, apparently, enjoyed, the, queen, s, protection, which, helped, him, keep, the, diocesan, church, after, he, was, removed, from, his, office, as, bishop, of, antioch, by, a, synod, of, bishops, in, 268, hughes, suggested, that, paul, s, position, while, zenobia, ruled, was, in, the, state, treasury, less, than, a, hundred, years, after, zenobia, s, reign, athanasius, of, alexandria, called, her, a, jewess, in, his, history, of, the, arians, in, 391, archbishop, john, chrysostom, wrote, that, zenobia, was, jewish, so, did, a, syriac, chronicler, around, 664, and, bishop, bar, hebraeus, in, the, thirteenth, century, according, to, french, scholar, javier, teixidor, zenobia, was, probably, a, proselyte, this, explained, her, strained, relationship, with, the, rabbis, teixidor, believed, that, zenobia, became, interested, in, judaism, when, longinus, spoke, about, the, philosopher, porphyry, and, his, interest, in, the, old, testament, although, talmudic, sources, were, hostile, to, palmyra, because, of, odaenathus, suppression, of, the, jews, of, nehardea, zenobia, apparently, had, the, support, of, some, jewish, communities, particularly, in, alexandria, in, cairo, a, plaque, originally, bearing, an, inscription, confirming, a, grant, of, immunity, to, a, jewish, synagogue, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, first, millennium, bc, by, king, ptolemy, euergetes, i, or, ii, was, found, at, a, much, later, date, the, plaque, was, re, inscribed, to, commemorate, the, restoration, of, immunity, on, the, orders, of, the, queen, and, king, although, it, is, undated, the, letters, of, the, inscription, date, to, long, after, cleopatra, and, anthony, s, era, zenobia, and, her, son, are, the, only, candidates, for, a, king, and, a, queen, ruling, egypt, after, the, ptolemies, the, historian, e, mary, smallwood, wrote, that, good, relations, with, the, diaspora, community, did, not, mean, that, the, jews, of, palestine, were, content, with, zenobia, s, reign, and, her, rule, was, apparently, opposed, in, that, region, the, jerusalem, talmud, in, tractate, terumot, tells, the, story, of, the, amoraim, rabbi, ammi, and, rabbi, samuel, bar, nahmani, who, visited, zenobia, s, court, and, asked, for, the, release, of, a, jew, zeir, bar, hinena, detained, on, her, orders, the, queen, refused, saying, why, have, you, come, to, save, him, he, teaches, that, your, creator, performs, miracles, for, you, why, not, let, god, save, him, during, aurelian, s, destruction, of, palmyra, palestinian, conscripts, with, clubs, and, cudgels, who, may, have, been, jews, played, a, vital, role, in, zenobia, s, defeat, and, the, destruction, of, her, city, there, is, no, evidence, of, zenobia, s, birth, as, a, jew, the, names, of, her, and, her, husband, s, families, belonged, to, the, aramaic, onomasticon, collection, of, names, the, queen, s, alleged, patronage, of, paul, of, samosata, who, was, accused, of, judaizing, may, have, given, rise, to, the, idea, that, she, was, a, proselyte, only, christian, accounts, note, zenobia, s, jewishness, no, jewish, source, mentions, it, the, queen, probably, spent, most, of, her, reign, in, antioch, syria, s, administrative, capital, before, the, monarchy, palmyra, had, the, institutions, of, a, greek, city, polis, and, was, ruled, by, a, senate, which, was, responsible, for, most, civil, affairs, odaenathus, maintained, palmyra, s, institutions, as, did, zenobia, a, palmyrene, inscription, after, her, fall, records, the, name, of, septimius, haddudan, a, palmyrene, senator, however, the, queen, apparently, ruled, autocratically, septimius, worod, odaenathus, viceroy, and, one, of, palmyra, s, most, important, officials, disappeared, from, the, record, after, zenobia, s, ascent, the, queen, opened, the, doors, of, her, government, to, eastern, nobility, zenobia, s, most, important, courtiers, and, advisers, were, her, generals, septemius, zabdas, and, septimius, zabbai, both, of, whom, were, generals, under, odaenathus, and, received, the, gentilicium, surname, septimius, from, him, odaenathus, respected, the, roman, emperor, s, privilege, of, appointing, provincial, governors, and, zenobia, continued, this, policy, during, her, early, reign, although, the, queen, did, not, interfere, in, day, to, day, administration, she, probably, had, the, power, to, command, the, governors, in, the, organization, of, border, security, during, the, rebellion, zenobia, maintained, roman, forms, of, administration, but, appointed, the, governors, herself, most, notably, in, egypt, where, julius, marcellinus, took, office, in, 270, and, was, followed, by, statilius, ammianus, in, 271, zenobia, initially, avoided, provoking, rome, by, claiming, for, herself, and, her, son, the, titles, inherited, from, odaenathus, of, subject, of, rome, and, protector, of, its, eastern, frontier, after, expanding, her, territory, she, seems, to, have, tried, to, be, recognized, as, an, imperial, partner, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, and, presented, her, son, as, subordinate, to, the, emperor, in, late, 270, zenobia, minted, coinage, bearing, the, portraits, of, aurelian, and, vaballathus, aurelian, was, titled, emperor, and, vaballathus, king, the, regnal, year, in, early, samples, of, the, coinage, was, only, aurelian, s, by, march, 271, despite, indicating, aurelian, as, the, paramount, monarch, by, naming, him, first, in, the, dating, formulae, the, coinage, also, began, bearing, vaballathus, regnal, year, by, indicating, in, the, coinage, that, vaballathus, reign, began, in, 267, three, years, before, the, emperor, s, vaballathus, appeared, to, be, aurelian, s, senior, colleague, the, emperor, s, blessing, of, palmyrene, authority, has, been, debated, aurelian, s, acceptance, of, palmyrene, rule, in, egypt, may, be, inferred, from, the, oxyrhynchus, papyri, which, are, dated, by, the, regnal, years, of, the, emperor, and, vaballathus, no, proof, of, a, formal, agreement, exists, and, the, evidence, is, based, solely, on, the, joint, coinage, and, papyri, dating, it, is, unlikely, that, aurelian, would, have, accepted, such, power, sharing, but, he, was, unable, to, act, in, 271, due, to, crises, in, the, west, his, apparent, condoning, of, zenobia, s, actions, may, have, been, a, ruse, to, give, her, a, false, sense, of, security, while, he, prepared, for, war, another, reason, for, aurelian, s, tolerance, may, have, been, his, desire, to, ensure, a, constant, supply, of, egyptian, grain, to, rome, it, is, not, recorded, that, the, supply, was, cut, and, the, ships, sailed, to, rome, in, 270, as, usual, some, modern, scholars, such, as, harold, mattingly, suggest, that, claudius, gothicus, had, concluded, a, formal, agreement, with, zenobia, which, aurelian, ignored, an, inscription, found, in, palmyra, and, dated, to, august, 271, called, zenobia, eusebes, the, pious, this, title, used, by, roman, empresses, could, be, seen, as, a, step, by, the, queen, toward, an, imperial, title, another, contemporary, inscription, called, her, sebaste, the, greek, equivalent, of, empress, latin, augusta, but, also, acknowledged, the, roman, emperor, a, late, 271, egyptian, grain, receipt, equated, aurelian, and, vaballathus, jointly, calling, them, augusti, finally, palmyra, officially, broke, with, rome, the, alexandrian, and, antiochian, mints, removed, aurelian, s, portrait, from, the, coins, in, april, 272, issuing, new, tetradrachms, in, the, names, of, vaballathus, and, zenobia, who, were, called, augustus, and, augusta, respectively, the, assumption, of, imperial, titles, by, zenobia, signaled, a, usurpation, independence, from, and, open, rebellion, against, aurelian, the, timeline, of, events, and, why, zenobia, declared, herself, empress, is, vague, in, the, second, half, of, 271, aurelian, marched, to, the, east, but, was, delayed, by, the, goths, in, the, balkans, this, may, have, alarmed, the, queen, driving, her, to, claim, the, imperial, title, zenobia, also, probably, understood, the, inevitability, of, open, conflict, with, aurelian, and, decided, that, feigning, subordination, would, be, useless, her, assumption, of, the, imperial, title, was, used, to, rally, soldiers, to, her, cause, aurelian, s, campaign, seems, to, have, been, the, main, reason, for, the, palmyrene, imperial, declaration, and, the, removal, of, his, portrait, from, its, coins, the, usurpation, which, began, in, late, march, or, early, april, 272, ended, by, august, aurelian, spent, the, winter, of, 271, 272, in, byzantium, and, probably, crossed, the, bosporus, to, asia, minor, in, april, 272, galatia, fell, easily, the, palmyrene, garrisons, were, apparently, withdrawn, and, the, provincial, capital, of, ancyra, was, regained, without, a, struggle, all, the, cities, in, asia, minor, opened, their, doors, to, the, roman, emperor, with, only, tyana, putting, up, some, resistance, before, surrendering, this, cleared, the, path, for, aurelian, to, invade, syria, the, palmyrene, heartland, a, simultaneous, expedition, reached, egypt, in, may, 272, by, early, june, alexandria, was, captured, by, the, romans, followed, by, the, rest, of, egypt, by, the, third, week, of, june, zenobia, seems, to, have, withdrawn, most, of, her, armies, from, egypt, to, focus, on, syria, which, if, lost, would, have, meant, the, end, of, palmyra, in, may, 272, aurelian, headed, toward, antioch, about, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, north, of, the, city, he, defeated, the, palmyrene, army, led, by, zabdas, at, the, battle, of, immae, as, a, result, zenobia, who, waited, in, antioch, during, the, battle, retreated, with, her, army, to, emesa, to, conceal, the, disaster, and, make, her, flight, safer, she, spread, reports, that, aurelian, was, captured, zabdas, found, a, man, who, resembled, the, roman, emperor, and, paraded, him, through, antioch, the, following, day, aurelian, entered, the, city, before, marching, south, after, defeating, a, palmyrene, garrison, south, of, antioch, aurelian, continued, his, march, to, meet, zenobia, in, the, battle, of, emesa, the, 70, 000, strong, palmyrene, army, assembled, on, the, plain, of, emesa, nearly, routed, the, romans, in, an, initial, thrill, of, victory, they, hastened, their, advance, breaking, their, lines, and, enabling, the, roman, infantry, to, attack, their, flank, the, defeated, zenobia, headed, to, her, capital, on, the, advice, of, her, war, council, leaving, her, treasury, behind, in, palmyra, the, empress, prepared, for, a, siege, aurelian, blockaded, food, supply, routes, and, there, were, probably, unsuccessful, negotiations, according, to, the, augustan, history, zenobia, said, that, she, would, fight, aurelian, with, the, help, of, her, persian, allies, however, the, story, was, probably, fabricated, and, used, by, the, emperor, to, link, zenobia, to, rome, s, greatest, enemy, if, such, an, alliance, existed, a, much, larger, frontier, war, would, have, erupted, however, no, persian, army, was, sent, as, the, situation, worsened, the, queen, left, the, city, for, persia, intending, on, seeking, help, from, palmyra, s, former, enemy, according, to, zosimus, she, rode, a, female, camel, the, fastest, of, its, breed, and, faster, than, any, horse, aurelian, learning, about, zenobia, s, departure, sent, a, contingent, which, captured, the, empress, before, she, could, cross, the, euphrates, to, persia, palmyra, capitulated, soon, after, news, of, zenobia, s, captivity, reached, the, city, in, august, 272, aurelian, sent, the, empress, and, her, son, to, emesa, for, trial, followed, by, most, of, palmyra, s, court, elite, including, longinus, according, to, the, augustan, history, and, zosimus, zenobia, blamed, her, actions, on, her, advisers, however, there, are, no, contemporary, sources, describing, the, trial, only, later, hostile, roman, ones, the, empress, s, reported, cowardice, in, defeat, was, probably, aurelian, s, propaganda, it, benefited, the, emperor, to, paint, zenobia, as, selfish, and, traitorous, discouraging, the, palmyrenes, from, hailing, her, as, a, hero, although, aurelian, had, most, of, his, prisoners, executed, he, spared, the, empress, and, her, son, to, parade, her, in, his, planned, triumph, zenobia, s, fate, after, emesa, is, uncertain, since, ancient, historians, left, conflicting, accounts, zosimus, wrote, that, she, died, before, crossing, the, bosporus, on, her, way, to, rome, according, to, this, account, the, empress, became, ill, or, starved, herself, to, death, the, generally, unreliable, chronicler, john, malalas, wrote, that, aurelian, humiliated, zenobia, by, parading, her, through, the, eastern, cities, on, a, dromedary, in, antioch, the, emperor, had, her, chained, and, seated, on, a, dais, in, the, hippodrome, for, three, days, before, the, city, s, populace, malalas, concluded, his, account, by, writing, that, zenobia, appeared, in, aurelian, s, triumph, and, was, then, beheaded, most, ancient, historians, and, modern, scholars, agree, that, zenobia, was, displayed, in, aurelian, s, 274, triumph, zosimus, was, the, only, source, to, say, that, the, empress, died, before, reaching, rome, making, his, account, questionable, a, public, humiliation, as, recounted, by, malalas, is, a, plausible, scenario, since, aurelian, would, probably, have, wanted, to, publicize, his, suppression, of, the, palmyrene, rebellion, only, malalas, however, describes, zenobia, s, beheading, according, to, the, other, historians, her, life, was, spared, after, aurelian, s, triumph, the, augustan, history, recorded, that, aurelian, gave, zenobia, a, villa, in, tibur, near, hadrian, s, villa, where, she, lived, with, her, children, zonaras, wrote, that, zenobia, married, a, nobleman, and, syncellus, wrote, that, she, married, a, roman, senator, the, house, she, reportedly, occupied, became, a, tourist, attraction, in, rome, the, queen, owed, her, elevated, position, to, her, son, s, minority, to, celebrate, herodianus, coronation, a, statue, was, erected, in, palmyra, in, 263, according, to, the, inscription, on, the, base, of, the, statue, it, was, commissioned, by, septimius, worod, then, the, duumviri, magistrate, of, palmyra, and, julius, aurelius, the, queen, s, procurator, treasurer, according, to, the, historian, david, potter, zenobia, is, the, queen, mentioned, and, the, inscription, is, an, evidence, for, the, usage, of, the, title, by, her, during, odaenathus, lifetime, an, inscription, on, a, milestone, on, the, road, between, palmyra, and, emesa, dated, to, zenobia, s, early, reign, identifies, her, as, illustrious, queen, mother, of, the, king, of, kings, this, was, the, first, inscription, giving, her, an, official, position, a, lead, token, from, antioch, also, identifies, zenobia, as, queen, the, earliest, confirmed, attestation, of, zenobia, as, queen, in, palmyra, is, an, inscription, on, the, base, of, a, statue, erected, for, her, by, zabdas, and, zabbai, dated, to, august, 271, and, calling, her, most, illustrious, and, pious, queen, on, an, undated, milestone, found, near, byblos, zenobia, is, titled, sebaste, the, queen, was, never, acknowledged, as, sole, monarch, in, palmyra, although, she, was, the, de, facto, sovereign, of, the, empire, she, was, always, associated, with, her, husband, or, son, in, inscriptions, except, in, egypt, where, some, coins, were, minted, in, zenobia, s, name, alone, according, to, her, coins, the, queen, assumed, the, title, of, augusta, empress, in, 272, and, reigned, under, the, regnal, name, septimia, zenobia, augusta, aside, from, vaballathus, it, is, unclear, if, zenobia, had, other, children, and, their, alleged, identities, are, subject, to, scholarly, disagreements, the, image, of, a, child, named, hairan, ii, appears, on, a, seal, impression, with, that, of, his, brother, vaballathus, no, name, of, a, mother, was, engraved, and, the, seal, is, undated, odaenathus, son, herodianus, is, identified, by, udo, hartmann, with, hairan, i, a, son, of, odaenathus, who, appears, in, palmyrene, inscriptions, as, early, as, 251, david, s, potter, on, the, other, hand, suggested, that, hairan, ii, is, the, son, of, zenobia, and, that, he, is, herodianus, instead, of, hairan, i, nathanael, andrade, maintained, that, hairan, i, herodianus, and, hairan, ii, are, the, same, person, rejecting, the, existence, of, a, second, hairan, a, controversial, palmyrene, inscription, mentions, the, mother, of, the, king, septimius, antiochus, the, name, of, the, queen, is, missing, and, dittenberger, refused, to, fill, the, gap, with, zenobia, s, name, but, many, scholars, such, as, grace, macurdy, considered, that, the, missing, name, is, zenobia, septimius, antiochus, may, have, been, vaballathus, younger, brother, or, was, presented, in, this, manner, for, political, reasons, antiochus, was, proclaimed, emperor, in, 273, when, palmyra, revolted, against, rome, for, a, second, time, if, antiochus, was, a, son, of, zenobia, he, was, probably, a, young, child, not, fathered, by, odaenathus, zosimus, described, him, as, insignificant, appropriate, for, a, five, year, old, boy, on, the, other, hand, macurdy, citing, the, language, zosimus, used, when, he, described, him, considered, it, more, plausible, that, antiochus, was, not, a, son, of, zenobia, but, a, family, relation, who, used, her, name, to, legitimize, his, claim, to, the, throne, the, names, of, herennianus, and, timolaus, were, mentioned, as, children, of, zenobia, only, in, the, historia, augusta, herennianus, may, be, a, conflation, of, hairan, and, herodianus, timolaus, is, probably, a, fabrication, although, the, historian, dietmar, kienast, suggested, that, he, might, have, been, vaballathus, according, to, the, historia, augusta, zenobia, s, descendants, were, roman, nobility, during, the, reign, of, emperor, valens, reigned, 364, 375, eutropius, and, jerome, chronicled, the, queen, s, descendants, in, rome, during, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, they, may, have, been, the, result, of, a, reported, marriage, to, a, roman, spouse, or, offspring, who, accompanied, her, from, palmyra, both, theories, however, are, tentative, zonaras, is, the, only, historian, to, note, that, zenobia, had, daughters, he, wrote, that, one, married, aurelian, who, married, the, queen, s, other, daughters, to, distinguished, romans, according, to, southern, the, emperor, s, marriage, to, zenobia, s, daughter, is, a, fabrication, another, descent, claim, is, the, relation, of, saint, zenobius, of, florence, 337, 417, with, the, queen, the, girolami, banking, family, claimed, descent, from, the, fifth, century, saint, and, the, alleged, relation, was, first, noted, in, 1286, the, family, also, extended, their, roots, to, zenobia, by, claiming, that, the, saint, was, a, descendant, of, her, an, evaluation, of, zenobia, is, difficult, the, queen, was, courageous, when, her, husband, s, supremacy, was, threatened, and, by, seizing, the, throne, she, protected, the, region, from, a, power, vacuum, after, odaenathus, death, according, to, watson, she, made, what, odaenathus, left, her, a, glittering, show, of, strength, in, the, view, of, watson, zenobia, should, not, be, seen, as, a, total, powermonger, nor, as, a, selfless, hero, fighting, for, a, cause, according, to, the, historian, david, graf, she, took, seriously, the, titles, and, responsibilities, she, assumed, for, her, son, and, that, her, program, was, far, more, ecumenical, and, imaginative, than, that, of, her, husband, odenathus, not, just, more, ambitious, zenobia, has, inspired, scholars, academics, musicians, and, actors, her, fame, has, lingered, in, the, west, and, is, supreme, in, the, middle, east, as, a, heroic, queen, with, a, tragic, end, she, stands, alongside, cleopatra, and, boudica, the, queen, s, legend, turned, her, into, an, idol, that, can, be, reinterpreted, to, accommodate, the, needs, of, writers, and, historians, thus, zenobia, has, been, by, turns, a, freedom, fighter, a, hero, of, the, oppressed, and, a, national, symbol, the, queen, is, a, female, role, model, according, to, the, historian, michael, rostovtzeff, catherine, the, great, liked, to, compare, herself, to, zenobia, as, a, woman, who, created, military, might, and, an, intellectual, court, during, the, 1930s, thanks, to, an, egyptian, based, feminist, press, zenobia, became, an, icon, for, women, s, magazine, readers, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, as, a, strong, nationalistic, female, leader, her, most, lasting, legacy, is, in, syria, where, the, queen, is, a, national, symbol, zenobia, became, an, icon, for, syrian, nationalists, she, had, a, cult, following, among, western, educated, syrians, and, an, 1871, novel, by, journalist, salim, al, bustani, was, entitled, zenobia, malikat, tadmor, zenobia, queen, of, palmyra, syrian, nationalist, ilyas, matar, who, wrote, syria, s, first, history, in, arabic, in, 1874, al, uqud, al, durriyya, fi, tarikh, al, mamlaka, al, suriyya, the, pearl, necklace, in, the, history, of, the, syrian, kingdom, was, fascinated, by, zenobia, and, included, her, in, his, book, to, matar, the, queen, kindled, hope, for, a, new, zenobia, who, would, restore, syria, s, former, grandeur, another, history, of, syria, was, written, by, jurji, yanni, in, 1881, in, which, yanni, called, zenobia, a, daughter, of, the, fatherland, and, yearned, for, her, glorious, past, yanni, described, aurelian, as, a, tyrant, who, deprived, syria, of, its, happiness, and, independence, by, capturing, its, queen, in, modern, syria, zenobia, is, regarded, as, a, patriotic, symbol, her, image, appeared, on, banknotes, and, in, 1997, she, was, the, subject, of, the, television, series, al, ababeed, the, anarchy, the, series, was, watched, by, millions, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, it, examined, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, from, a, syrian, perspective, where, the, queen, s, struggle, symbolized, the, palestinians, struggle, to, gain, the, right, of, self, determination, zenobia, was, also, the, subject, of, a, biography, by, mustafa, tlass, syria, s, former, minister, of, defense, and, one, of, the, country, s, most, prominent, figures, harold, mattingly, called, zenobia, one, of, the, most, romantic, figures, in, history, according, to, southern, the, real, zenobia, is, elusive, perhaps, ultimately, unattainable, and, novelists, playwrights, and, historians, alike, can, absorb, the, available, evidence, but, still, need, to, indulge, in, varied, degrees, of, speculation, she, has, been, the, subject, of, romantic, and, ideologically, driven, biographies, by, ancient, and, modern, writers, the, augustan, history, is, the, clearest, example, of, an, ideological, account, of, zenobia, s, life, and, its, author, acknowledged, that, it, was, written, to, criticize, the, emperor, gallienus, according, to, the, augustan, history, gallienus, was, weak, because, he, allowed, a, woman, to, rule, part, of, the, empire, and, zenobia, was, a, more, able, sovereign, than, the, emperor, the, narrative, changed, as, the, augustan, history, moved, on, to, the, life, of, claudius, gothicus, a, lauded, and, victorious, emperor, with, the, author, characterizing, zenobia, s, protection, of, the, eastern, frontier, as, a, wise, delegation, of, power, by, claudius, when, the, augustan, history, reached, the, biography, of, aurelian, the, author, s, view, of, zenobia, changed, dramatically, the, queen, is, depicted, as, a, guilty, insolent, proud, coward, her, wisdom, was, discredited, and, her, actions, deemed, the, result, of, manipulation, by, advisers, zenobia, s, staunch, beauty, was, emphasized, by, the, author, of, the, augustan, history, who, ascribed, to, her, feminine, timidity, and, inconsistency, the, reasons, for, her, alleged, betrayal, of, her, advisers, to, save, herself, the, queen, s, sex, posed, a, dilemma, for, the, augustan, history, since, it, cast, a, shadow, on, aurelian, s, victory, its, author, ascribed, many, masculine, traits, to, zenobia, to, make, aurelian, a, conquering, hero, who, suppressed, a, dangerous, amazon, queen, according, to, the, augustan, history, zenobia, had, a, clear, manly, voice, dressed, as, an, emperor, rather, than, an, empress, rode, horseback, was, attended, by, eunuchs, instead, of, ladies, in, waiting, marched, with, her, army, drank, with, her, generals, was, careful, with, money, contrary, to, the, stereotypical, spending, habits, of, her, sex, and, pursued, masculine, hobbies, such, as, hunting, giovanni, boccaccio, wrote, a, fanciful, 14th, century, account, of, the, queen, in, which, she, is, a, tomboy, in, childhood, who, preferred, wrestling, with, boys, wandering, in, the, forests, and, killing, goats, to, playing, like, a, young, girl, zenobia, s, chastity, was, a, theme, of, these, romanticized, accounts, according, to, the, augustan, history, she, disdained, sexual, intercourse, and, allowed, odaenathus, into, her, bed, only, for, conception, her, reputed, chastity, impressed, some, male, historians, edward, gibbon, wrote, that, zenobia, surpassed, cleopatra, in, chastity, and, valor, according, to, boccaccio, zenobia, safeguarded, her, virginity, when, she, wrestled, with, boys, as, a, child, seventeenth, century, visitors, to, palmyra, rekindled, the, western, world, s, romantic, interest, in, zenobia, this, interest, peaked, during, the, mid,
