johannes, vermeer, v, r, m, r, v, r, m, r, dutch, see, below, also, known, as, jan, vermeer, october, 1632, 15, december, 1675, was, a, dutch, painter, who, specialized, in, domestic, interior, scenes, of, middle, class, life, he, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, painters, of, the, dutch, golden, age, during, his, lifetime, he, was, a, moderately, successful, provincial, genre, painter, recognized, in, delft, and, the, hague, he, produced, relatively, few, paintings, primarily, earning, his, living, as, an, art, dealer, he, was, not, wealthy, at, his, death, his, wife, was, left, in, debt, vermeer, worked, slowly, and, with, great, care, and, frequently, used, very, expensive, pigments, he, is, particularly, renowned, for, making, masterful, use, of, light, in, his, work, almost, all, his, paintings, hans, koningsberger, wrote, are, apparently, set, in, two, smallish, rooms, in, his, house, in, delft, they, show, the, same, furniture, and, decorations, in, various, arrangements, and, they, often, portray, the, same, people, mostly, women, the, modest, celebrity, he, enjoyed, during, his, life, gave, way, to, obscurity, after, his, death, he, was, barely, mentioned, in, arnold, houbraken, s, major, source, book, on, 17th, century, dutch, painting, grand, theatre, of, dutch, painters, and, women, artists, published, 1718, and, as, a, result, was, omitted, from, subsequent, surveys, of, dutch, art, for, nearly, two, centuries, in, the, 19th, century, vermeer, was, rediscovered, by, gustav, friedrich, waagen, and, th, ophile, thor, b, rger, who, published, an, essay, attributing, 66, pictures, to, him, although, only, 34, paintings, are, universally, attributed, to, him, today, since, that, time, vermeer, s, reputation, has, grown, enormously, in, dutch, vermeer, is, pronounced, and, johannes, vermeer, as, with, v, assimilating, to, the, preceding, voiceless, s, as, the, usual, english, pronunciation, is, v, r, m, r, with, v, r, m, r, with, a, long, first, vowel, occurring, in, the, uk, v, r, m, r, is, also, documented, another, pronunciation, v, r, m, r, is, attested, from, the, uk, relatively, little, was, known, about, vermeer, s, life, until, recently, he, seems, to, have, been, devoted, exclusively, to, his, art, living, out, his, life, in, the, city, of, delft, until, the, 19th, century, the, only, sources, of, information, were, a, few, registers, official, documents, and, comments, by, other, artists, for, this, reason, thor, b, rger, named, him, the, sphinx, of, delft, john, michael, montias, added, details, on, the, family, from, the, city, archives, of, delft, in, his, artists, and, artisans, in, delft, a, socio, economic, study, of, the, seventeenth, century, 1982, johannes, vermeer, was, baptized, within, the, reformed, church, on, 31, october, 1632, his, mother, digna, baltens, c, 1596, 1670, was, from, antwerp, digna, s, father, balthasar, geerts, or, gerrits, born, in, antwerp, in, or, around, 1573, led, an, enterprising, life, in, metalworking, and, was, arrested, for, counterfeiting, vermeer, s, father, named, reijnier, janszoon, was, a, middle, class, worker, of, silk, or, caffa, a, mixture, of, silk, and, cotton, or, wool, he, was, the, son, of, jan, reyersz, and, cornelia, neeltge, goris, as, an, apprentice, in, amsterdam, reijnier, lived, on, fashionable, sint, antoniesbreestraat, a, street, with, many, resident, painters, at, the, time, in, 1615, reijnier, married, digna, the, couple, moved, to, delft, and, had, a, daughter, named, gertruy, who, was, baptized, in, 1620, in, 1625, reijnier, was, involved, in, a, fight, with, a, soldier, named, willem, van, bylandt, who, died, from, his, wounds, five, months, later, around, this, time, reijnier, began, dealing, in, paintings, in, 1631, he, leased, an, inn, which, he, called, the, flying, fox, in, 1635, he, lived, on, voldersgracht, 25, or, 26, in, 1641, he, bought, a, larger, inn, on, the, market, square, named, after, the, flemish, town, mechelen, the, acquisition, of, the, inn, constituted, a, considerable, financial, burden, when, reijnier, died, in, october, 1652, vermeer, took, over, the, operation, of, the, family, s, art, business, in, april, 1653, johannes, reijniersz, vermeer, married, a, catholic, woman, catharina, bolnes, bolenes, the, blessing, took, place, in, the, quiet, nearby, village, of, schipluiden, vermeer, s, new, mother, in, law, maria, thins, was, initially, opposed, to, the, marriage, as, she, was, significantly, wealthier, than, he, and, it, was, probably, she, who, insisted, that, vermeer, convert, to, catholicism, before, the, marriage, on, 5, april, the, fact, that, vermeer, s, father, was, in, considerable, debt, also, did, not, help, in, discussions, on, the, marriage, leonaert, bramer, who, was, catholic, himself, put, in, a, good, word, for, vermeer, and, it, was, this, that, led, maria, to, drop, her, oppositions, according, to, art, historian, walter, liedtke, vermeer, s, conversion, seems, to, have, been, made, with, conviction, his, painting, the, allegory, of, faith, made, between, 1670, and, 1672, placed, less, emphasis, on, the, artists, usual, naturalistic, concerns, and, more, on, symbolic, religious, applications, including, the, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, walter, liedtke, in, dutch, paintings, in, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, suggests, that, it, was, made, for, a, learned, and, devout, catholic, patron, perhaps, for, his, schuilkerk, or, hidden, church, at, some, point, the, couple, moved, in, with, catharina, s, mother, who, lived, in, a, rather, spacious, house, at, oude, langendijk, almost, next, to, a, hidden, jesuit, church, here, vermeer, lived, for, the, rest, of, his, life, producing, paintings, in, the, front, room, on, the, second, floor, his, wife, gave, birth, to, 15, children, four, of, whom, were, buried, before, being, baptized, but, were, registered, as, child, of, johan, vermeer, the, names, of, 10, of, vermeer, s, children, are, known, from, wills, written, by, relatives, maertge, elisabeth, cornelia, aleydis, beatrix, johannes, gertruyd, franciscus, catharina, and, ignatius, most, of, these, names, are, those, of, saints, the, youngest, ignatius, was, likely, named, after, the, ignatius, of, loyola, it, is, unclear, where, and, with, whom, vermeer, apprenticed, as, a, painter, there, is, some, speculation, that, carel, fabritius, may, have, been, his, teacher, based, upon, a, controversial, interpretation, of, a, text, written, in, 1668, by, printer, arnold, bon, art, historians, have, found, no, hard, evidence, to, support, this, local, authority, leonaert, bramer, acted, as, a, friend, but, their, style, of, painting, is, rather, different, liedtke, suggests, that, vermeer, taught, himself, using, information, from, one, of, his, father, s, connections, some, scholars, think, that, vermeer, was, trained, under, catholic, painter, abraham, bloemaert, vermeer, s, style, is, similar, to, that, of, some, of, the, utrecht, caravaggists, whose, works, are, depicted, as, paintings, within, paintings, in, the, backgrounds, of, several, of, his, compositions, on, 29, december, 1653, vermeer, became, a, member, of, the, guild, of, saint, luke, a, trade, association, for, painters, the, guild, s, records, make, clear, that, vermeer, did, not, pay, the, usual, admission, fee, it, was, a, year, of, plague, war, and, economic, crisis, vermeer, was, not, alone, in, experiencing, difficult, financial, circumstances, in, 1654, a, terrible, explosion, known, as, the, delft, thunderclap, at, a, gunpowder, store, destroyed, a, large, section, of, the, city, pieter, van, ruijven, and, maria, de, knuijt, were, vermeer, s, patrons, for, the, better, part, of, the, artist, s, career, in, 2023, his, wife, maria, de, knuijt, was, identified, by, the, curators, of, the, 2023, exhibition, of, vermeer, s, works, at, the, rijksmuseum, in, amsterdam, as, the, main, patron, due, to, her, long, standing, and, supportive, relationship, with, the, artist, it, seems, that, vermeer, turned, for, inspiration, to, the, art, of, the, fijnschilders, from, leiden, vermeer, was, responding, to, the, market, of, gerard, dou, s, paintings, who, sold, his, paintings, for, exorbitant, prices, dou, may, have, influenced, pieter, de, hooch, and, gabriel, metsu, too, vermeer, also, charged, higher, than, average, prices, for, his, work, most, of, which, were, purchased, by, an, unknown, collector, the, influence, of, johannes, vermeer, on, metsu, is, unmistakable, the, light, from, the, left, the, marble, floor, a, waiboer, however, suggests, that, metsu, requires, more, emotional, involvement, of, the, viewer, vermeer, probably, competed, also, with, nicolaes, maes, who, produced, genre, works, in, a, similar, style, in, 1662, vermeer, was, elected, head, of, the, guild, and, was, reelected, in, 1663, 1670, and, 1671, evidence, that, he, like, bramer, was, considered, an, established, craftsman, among, his, peers, vermeer, worked, slowly, probably, producing, three, paintings, a, year, on, order, balthasar, de, monconys, visited, him, in, 1663, to, see, some, of, his, work, but, vermeer, had, no, paintings, to, show, the, diplomat, and, the, two, french, clergymen, who, accompanied, him, were, sent, to, hendrick, van, buyten, a, baker, who, had, a, couple, of, his, paintings, as, collateral, in, 1671, gerrit, van, uylenburgh, organised, the, auction, of, gerrit, reynst, s, collection, and, offered, 13, paintings, and, some, sculptures, to, frederick, william, elector, of, brandenburg, frederick, accused, them, of, being, counterfeits, and, had, sent, 12, back, on, the, advice, of, hendrick, fromantiou, van, uylenburg, then, organized, a, counter, assessment, asking, a, total, of, 35, painters, to, pronounce, on, their, authenticity, including, jan, lievens, melchior, de, hondecoeter, gerbrand, van, den, eeckhout, and, johannes, vermeer, in, 1672, a, severe, economic, downturn, known, as, the, rampjaar, struck, the, dutch, republic, after, french, troops, led, by, louis, xiv, invaded, the, country, from, the, south, during, the, franco, dutch, war, at, the, same, time, troops, from, m, nster, and, cologne, invaded, the, country, from, the, east, causing, more, destruction, many, people, panicked, courts, theaters, shops, and, schools, were, closed, vermeer, s, sale, of, a, painting, that, year, was, his, last, five, years, passed, before, circumstances, improved, in, 1674, vermeer, was, listed, as, a, member, of, the, civic, guards, in, the, summer, of, 1675, vermeer, borrowed, 1, 000, guilders, in, amsterdam, from, jacob, romboutsz, grandfather, of, hendrick, sorgh, an, amsterdam, silk, trader, using, his, mother, in, law, s, property, as, a, surety, on, 15, december, 1675, vermeer, died, after, a, short, illness, aged, 43, he, was, buried, in, the, protestant, old, church, on, 15, december, 1675, in, a, petition, to, her, creditors, catharina, bolnes, attributed, her, husband, s, death, to, the, stress, of, financial, pressures, and, described, his, death, as, follows, during, the, ruinous, war, with, france, he, not, only, was, unable, to, sell, any, of, his, art, but, also, to, his, great, detriment, was, left, sitting, with, the, paintings, of, other, masters, that, he, was, dealing, in, as, a, result, and, owing, to, the, great, burden, of, his, children, having, no, means, of, his, own, he, lapsed, into, such, decay, and, decadence, which, he, had, so, taken, to, heart, that, as, if, he, had, fallen, into, a, frenzy, in, a, day, and, a, half, he, went, from, being, healthy, to, being, dead, catharina, describes, how, the, collapse, of, the, art, market, had, damaged, vermeer, s, business, as, both, a, painter, and, an, art, dealer, she, had, to, raise, 11, children, and, therefore, asked, the, high, court, to, relieve, her, of, debts, owed, to, vermeer, s, creditors, pioneering, dutch, microscopist, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, who, worked, for, the, city, council, as, a, surveyor, was, appointed, trustee, the, house, had, eight, rooms, on, the, first, floor, the, contents, of, which, were, listed, in, an, inventory, taken, a, few, months, after, vermeer, s, death, in, his, studio, there, were, two, chairs, two, painter, s, easels, three, palettes, 10, canvases, a, desk, an, oak, pull, table, a, small, wooden, cupboard, with, drawers, and, rummage, not, worthy, being, itemized, nineteen, of, vermeer, s, paintings, were, bequeathed, to, catharina, and, her, mother, the, widow, sold, two, more, paintings, to, hendrick, van, buyten, to, pay, off, a, substantial, debt, vermeer, had, been, a, respected, artist, in, delft, but, he, was, almost, unknown, outside, his, hometown, a, local, patron, named, pieter, van, ruijven, had, purchased, much, of, his, output, which, kept, vermeer, afloat, financially, but, reduced, the, possibility, of, his, fame, spreading, several, factors, contributed, to, his, limited, body, of, work, vermeer, never, had, any, pupils, though, one, scholar, has, suggested, that, vermeer, taught, his, eldest, daughter, maria, to, paint, additionally, his, family, obligations, with, so, many, children, may, have, taken, up, much, of, his, time, as, would, acting, as, both, an, art, dealer, and, inn, keeper, in, running, the, family, businesses, his, time, spent, serving, as, head, of, the, guild, and, his, extraordinary, precision, as, a, painter, may, have, also, limited, his, output, vermeer, may, have, first, executed, his, paintings, tonally, like, most, painters, of, his, time, using, either, monochrome, shades, of, grey, grisaille, or, a, limited, palette, of, browns, and, greys, dead, coloring, over, which, he, would, apply, more, saturated, colors, reds, yellows, and, blues, in, the, form, of, transparent, glazes, no, drawings, have, been, positively, attributed, to, vermeer, and, his, paintings, offer, few, clues, to, preparatory, methods, there, is, no, other, 17th, century, artist, who, employed, the, exorbitantly, expensive, pigment, ultramarine, derived, from, natural, lapis, lazuli, either, so, lavishly, or, so, early, in, his, career, vermeer, used, this, in, not, just, elements, that, are, naturally, of, this, colour, he, also, used, it, early, in, a, work, beneath, subsequent, earth, colours, such, as, umber, and, ochre, to, subtly, tint, their, shade, this, working, method, most, probably, was, inspired, by, vermeer, s, understanding, of, leonardo, s, observations, that, the, surface, of, every, object, partakes, of, the, colour, of, the, adjacent, object, an, example, of, vermeer, using, ultramarine, as, an, underpaint, is, in, the, girl, with, the, wine, glass, the, shadows, of, the, red, satin, dress, are, underpainted, in, natural, ultramarine, and, owing, to, this, underlying, blue, paint, layer, the, red, lake, and, vermilion, mixture, applied, over, it, acquires, a, slightly, purple, cool, and, crisp, appearance, even, after, vermeer, s, evident, financial, breakdown, following, the, so, called, rampjaar, year, of, disaster, in, 1672, he, continued, to, employ, natural, ultramarine, generously, such, as, in, lady, seated, at, a, virginal, this, could, suggest, that, vermeer, was, supplied, with, materials, by, a, collector, and, would, coincide, with, john, michael, montias, theory, that, pieter, van, ruijven, was, vermeer, s, patron, vermeer, s, works, are, largely, genre, pieces, and, portraits, with, the, exception, of, two, cityscapes, and, two, allegories, his, subjects, offer, a, cross, section, of, seventeenth, century, dutch, society, ranging, from, the, portrayal, of, a, simple, milkmaid, at, work, to, the, luxury, and, splendour, of, rich, notables, and, merchantmen, in, their, roomy, houses, besides, these, subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and, scientific, comments, can, also, be, found, in, his, work, one, aspect, of, his, meticulous, painting, technique, was, vermeer, s, choice, of, pigments, he, is, best, known, for, his, frequent, use, of, the, very, expensive, ultramarine, the, milkmaid, and, also, lead, tin, yellow, a, lady, writing, a, letter, madder, lake, christ, in, the, house, of, martha, and, mary, and, vermilion, he, also, painted, with, ochres, bone, black, and, azurite, the, claim, that, he, used, indian, yellow, in, woman, holding, a, balance, has, been, disproven, by, pigment, analysis, in, vermeer, s, oeuvre, only, about, 20, pigments, have, been, detected, of, these, seven, principal, pigments, that, vermeer, commonly, employed, are, lead, white, yellow, ochre, vermilion, madder, lake, green, earth, raw, umber, and, ivory, or, bone, black, vermeer, s, painting, techniques, have, long, been, a, source, of, debate, given, their, almost, photorealistic, attention, to, detail, despite, vermeer, s, having, had, no, formal, training, and, despite, only, limited, evidence, that, vermeer, had, created, any, preparatory, sketches, or, traces, for, his, paintings, in, 2001, british, artist, david, hockney, published, the, book, secret, knowledge, rediscovering, the, lost, techniques, of, the, old, masters, in, which, he, argued, that, vermeer, among, other, renaissance, and, baroque, artists, including, hans, holbein, and, diego, vel, zquez, used, optics, to, achieve, precise, positioning, in, their, compositions, and, specifically, some, combination, of, curved, mirrors, camera, obscura, and, camera, lucida, this, became, known, as, the, hockney, falco, thesis, named, after, hockney, and, charles, m, falco, another, proponent, of, the, theory, philip, steadman, published, the, book, vermeer, s, camera, uncovering, the, truth, behind, the, masterpieces, in, 2001, which, specifically, claimed, that, vermeer, had, used, a, camera, obscura, to, create, his, paintings, steadman, noted, that, many, of, vermeer, s, paintings, had, been, painted, in, the, same, room, and, he, found, six, of, his, paintings, that, are, precisely, the, right, size, if, they, had, been, painted, from, inside, a, camera, obscura, in, the, room, s, back, wall, supporters, of, these, theories, have, pointed, to, evidence, in, some, of, vermeer, s, paintings, such, as, the, often, discussed, sparkling, pearly, highlights, in, vermeer, s, paintings, which, they, argue, are, the, result, of, the, primitive, lens, of, a, camera, obscura, producing, halation, it, was, also, postulated, that, a, camera, obscura, was, the, mechanical, cause, of, the, exaggerated, perspective, seen, in, the, music, lesson, london, royal, collection, in, 2008, american, entrepreneur, and, inventor, tim, jenison, developed, the, theory, that, vermeer, had, used, a, camera, obscura, along, with, a, comparator, mirror, which, is, similar, in, concept, to, a, camera, lucida, but, much, simpler, and, makes, it, easy, to, match, colour, values, he, later, modified, the, theory, to, simply, involve, a, concave, mirror, and, a, comparator, mirror, he, spent, the, next, five, years, testing, his, theory, by, re, creating, the, music, lesson, himself, using, these, tools, a, process, captured, in, the, 2013, documentary, film, tim, s, vermeer, several, points, were, brought, out, by, jenison, in, support, of, this, technique, first, was, vermeer, s, hyper, accurate, rendition, of, light, falloff, along, the, wall, neurobiologist, colin, blakemore, in, an, interview, with, jenison, notes, that, human, vision, cannot, process, information, about, the, absolute, brightness, of, a, scene, another, was, the, addition, of, several, highlights, and, outlines, consistent, with, matching, the, effects, of, chromatic, aberration, particularly, noticeable, in, primitive, optics, last, and, perhaps, most, telling, is, a, noticeable, curvature, in, the, original, painting, s, rendition, of, the, scrollwork, on, the, virginal, this, effect, matched, jenison, s, technique, precisely, caused, by, exactly, duplicating, the, view, as, seen, from, a, curved, mirror, this, theory, remains, disputed, there, is, no, historical, evidence, regarding, vermeer, s, interest, in, optics, and, the, detailed, inventory, of, the, artist, s, belongings, drawn, up, after, his, death, includes, no, camera, obscura, or, any, similar, device, however, vermeer, was, in, close, connection, with, pioneer, lens, maker, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, who, was, his, executor, after, death, it, is, believed, vermeer, produced, a, total, of, fewer, than, 50, paintings, of, which, 34, have, survived, only, three, vermeer, paintings, were, dated, by, the, artist, the, procuress, 1656, gem, ldegalerie, dresden, the, astronomer, 1668, mus, e, du, louvre, paris, and, the, geographer, 1669, st, delsches, kunstinstitut, frankfurt, vermeer, s, mother, in, law, maria, thins, owned, dirck, van, baburen, s, 1622, oil, on, canvas, the, procuress, or, a, copy, of, it, which, appears, in, the, background, of, two, of, vermeer, s, paintings, the, same, subject, was, also, painted, by, vermeer, almost, all, of, vermeer, s, paintings, are, of, contemporary, subjects, in, a, smaller, format, with, a, cooler, palette, dominated, by, blues, yellows, and, grays, vermeer, painted, multiple, artworks, portraying, a, pure, profile, like, the, painting, woman, with, a, pearl, necklace, which, was, uncommon, in, dutch, art, at, the, time, practically, all, of, his, surviving, works, belong, to, this, period, usually, domestic, interiors, with, one, or, two, figures, lit, by, a, window, on, the, left, they, are, characterized, by, a, sense, of, compositional, balance, and, spatial, order, unified, by, a, pearly, light, mundane, domestic, or, recreational, activities, are, imbued, with, a, poetic, timelessness, e, g, girl, reading, a, letter, at, an, open, window, dresden, gem, ldegalerie, vermeer, s, two, townscapes, have, also, been, attributed, to, this, period, view, of, delft, the, hague, mauritshuis, and, the, little, street, amsterdam, rijksmuseum, a, few, of, his, paintings, show, a, certain, hardening, of, manner, and, are, generally, thought, to, represent, his, late, works, from, this, period, come, the, allegory, of, faith, c, 1670, metropolitan, museum, of, art, new, york, and, the, love, letter, c, 1670, rijksmuseum, amsterdam, originally, vermeer, s, works, were, largely, overlooked, by, art, historians, for, two, centuries, after, his, death, a, select, number, of, connoisseurs, in, the, netherlands, did, appreciate, his, work, yet, even, so, many, of, his, works, were, attributed, to, then, better, known, artists, such, as, metsu, or, mieris, the, delft, master, s, modern, rediscovery, began, about, 1860, when, german, museum, director, gustav, waagen, saw, the, art, of, painting, in, the, czernin, gallery, in, vienna, and, recognized, the, work, as, a, vermeer, though, it, was, attributed, to, pieter, de, hooch, at, that, time, research, by, th, ophile, thor, b, rger, culminated, in, the, publication, of, his, catalogue, raisonn, of, vermeer, s, works, in, the, gazette, des, beaux, arts, in, 1866, thor, b, rger, s, catalogue, drew, international, attention, to, vermeer, and, listed, more, than, 70, works, by, him, including, many, that, he, regarded, as, uncertain, upon, the, rediscovery, of, vermeer, s, work, several, prominent, dutch, artists, modelled, their, style, on, his, work, including, simon, duiker, other, artists, who, were, inspired, by, vermeer, include, danish, painter, wilhelm, hammershoi, and, american, thomas, wilmer, dewing, in, the, 20th, century, vermeer, s, admirers, included, salvador, dal, who, painted, his, own, version, of, the, lacemaker, on, commission, from, collector, robert, lehman, and, pitted, large, copies, of, the, original, against, a, rhinoceros, in, some, surrealist, experiments, dali, also, celebrated, the, master, in, the, ghost, of, vermeer, of, delft, which, can, be, used, as, a, table, 1934, han, van, meegeren, was, a, 20th, century, dutch, painter, who, worked, in, the, classical, tradition, he, became, a, master, forger, motivated, by, a, blend, of, aesthetic, and, financial, reasons, creating, and, selling, many, new, vermeers, before, turning, himself, in, for, forgery, to, avoid, being, charged, with, capital, treason, for, collaboration, with, the, nazis, specifically, in, selling, what, had, been, believed, to, be,
