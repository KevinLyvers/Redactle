monmouth, rebellion, in, 1685, helped, secure, james, on, the, throne, but, he, was, a, key, player, in, the, military, conspiracy, that, led, to, james, being, deposed, during, the, glorious, revolution, rewarded, by, william, iii, with, the, title, earl, of, marlborough, persistent, charges, of, jacobitism, led, to, his, fall, from, office, and, temporary, imprisonment, in, the, tower, of, london, william, recognised, his, abilities, by, appointing, him, as, his, deputy, in, southern, netherlands, modern, day, belgium, before, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, 1701, but, not, until, the, accession, of, queen, anne, in, 1702, did, he, secure, his, fame, and, fortune, marriage, to, sarah, jennings, and, her, relationship, with, anne, ensured, marlborough, s, rise, first, to, the, captain, generalcy, of, british, forces, then, to, a, dukedom, as, de, facto, leader, of, allied, forces, in, the, low, countries, his, victories, at, battles, of, blenheim, 1704, of, ramillies, 1706, of, oudenarde, 1708, and, of, malplaquet, 1709, ensured, his, place, in, history, as, one, of, europe, s, great, generals, his, wife, s, stormy, relationship, with, the, queen, and, her, subsequent, dismissal, from, court, was, central, to, his, own, fall, incurring, anne, s, disfavour, and, caught, between, tory, and, whig, factions, marlborough, was, forced, from, office, and, went, into, self, imposed, exile, he, returned, to, favour, with, the, accession, of, george, i, to, the, throne, in, 1714, but, a, stroke, in, 1716, ended, his, career, marlborough, s, leadership, of, the, allied, armies, fighting, louis, xiv, from, 1701, to, 1710, consolidated, britain, s, emergence, as, a, front, rank, power, while, his, ability, to, maintain, unity, in, the, fractious, coalition, demonstrated, his, diplomatic, skills, he, is, often, remembered, by, military, historians, as, much, for, his, organisational, and, logistic, skills, as, his, tactical, abilities, however, he, was, also, instrumental, in, moving, away, from, the, siege, warfare, that, dominated, the, nine, years, war, churchill, secured, a, reputation, in, europe, that, was, unrivaled, until, the, rise, of, napoleon, churchill, was, the, second, but, eldest, surviving, son, of, sir, winston, churchill, of, glanvilles, wootton, dorset, and, elizabeth, drake, whose, family, came, from, ash, devon, winston, served, with, the, royalist, army, in, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, he, was, heavily, fined, for, doing, so, forcing, his, family, to, live, at, ash, house, with, his, mother, in, law, john, churchill, was, a, descendant, of, edward, i, through, his, daughter, joan, of, acre, after, the, 1660, restoration, of, charles, ii, winston, became, member, of, parliament, for, weymouth, and, from, 1662, served, as, commissioner, for, irish, land, claims, in, dublin, on, returning, to, london, in, 1663, he, was, knighted, and, received, a, position, at, whitehall, with, john, attending, st, paul, s, school, the, family, fortune, was, made, in, 1665, when, arabella, churchill, became, maid, of, honour, to, anne, hyde, and, began, an, affair, with, her, husband, james, duke, of, york, this, lasted, over, a, decade, james, had, four, acknowledged, children, by, her, including, james, fitzjames, 1st, duke, of, berwick, their, relationship, led, to, appointments, for, her, brothers, john, was, appointed, page, to, james, and, in, september, 1667, made, an, ensign, in, the, foot, guards, claims, that, churchill, served, with, the, tangier, garrison, cannot, be, confirmed, but, he, is, recorded, as, being, with, sir, thomas, allin, in, the, mediterranean, from, march, to, november, 1670, he, returned, to, london, where, in, february, 1671, he, engaged, in, a, duel, with, sir, john, fenwick, he, allegedly, had, an, affair, with, barbara, villiers, a, mistress, of, charles, ii, and, may, have, fathered, her, daughter, barbara, fitzroy, although, he, never, formally, acknowledged, her, in, 1670, treaty, of, dover, charles, ii, agreed, to, support, a, french, attack, on, the, dutch, republic, and, supply, a, british, brigade, of, 6, 000, troops, for, the, french, army, louis, xiv, paid, him, 230, 000, per, year, for, this, when, the, franco, dutch, war, began, in, 1672, churchill, was, present, at, the, battle, of, solebay, on, 28, may, possibly, aboard, james, s, flagship, the, prince, which, was, crippled, shortly, thereafter, churchill, was, commissioned, captain, in, the, duke, of, york, s, admiralty, regiment, part, of, the, british, brigade, commanded, by, the, duke, of, monmouth, the, alliance, with, catholic, france, was, extremely, unpopular, and, many, doubted, the, brigade, s, reliability, against, the, dutch, as, a, result, it, served, in, the, rhineland, against, the, holy, roman, empire, although, churchill, monmouth, and, other, volunteers, took, part, in, the, french, siege, of, maastricht, england, withdrew, from, the, war, with, the, 1674, treaty, of, westminster, but, to, keep, his, subsidies, charles, encouraged, members, of, the, anglo, scots, force, to, remain, in, french, service, many, did, so, including, monmouth, and, churchill, who, became, colonel, of, one, such, regiment, serving, under, marshal, turenne, he, was, present, at, sinsheim, in, june, 1674, enzheim, in, october, and, possibly, at, sasbach, in, july, 1675, where, turenne, was, killed, sometime, around, 1675, churchill, met, the, 15, year, old, sarah, jennings, who, came, from, a, similar, background, of, minor, royalist, gentry, ruined, by, the, war, the, family, moved, to, london, after, her, father, died, and, in, 1673, sarah, and, her, sister, frances, joined, the, household, of, mary, of, modena, james, s, second, catholic, wife, despite, opposition, from, his, father, who, wanted, him, to, marry, the, wealthy, catherine, sedley, churchill, married, sarah, in, the, winter, of, 1677, 78, helped, by, mary, the, couple, had, five, children, who, survived, to, adulthood, henrietta, churchill, 2nd, duchess, of, marlborough, lady, anne, churchill, john, churchill, marquess, of, blandford, elizabeth, and, mary, in, november, 1677, william, of, orange, married, james, s, eldest, daughter, mary, and, in, march, 1678, the, earl, of, danby, negotiated, an, anglo, dutch, defensive, alliance, churchill, was, sent, to, the, hague, to, make, arrangements, for, an, expeditionary, force, although, english, troops, did, not, arrive, in, significant, numbers, until, after, the, peace, of, nijmegen, ended, the, war, on, 10, august, james, publicly, confirmed, his, conversion, to, catholicism, in, 1673, as, heir, to, the, throne, this, led, to, a, political, crisis, that, dominated, english, politics, from, 1679, to, 1681, in, the, 1679, general, election, churchill, was, elected, mp, for, newtown, the, majority, supported, james, s, exclusion, and, he, spent, the, next, three, years, in, exile, churchill, acting, as, his, liaison, with, the, court, charles, defeated, the, exclusionists, and, dismissed, parliament, in, 1681, allowing, james, to, return, to, london, in, 1682, churchill, was, made, lord, churchill, of, eyemouth, in, the, peerage, of, scotland, and, the, following, year, colonel, of, the, king, s, own, royal, regiment, of, dragoons, these, rewards, allowed, him, to, live, in, some, style, and, comfort, in, addition, to, a, house, in, london, he, purchased, holywell, house, near, st, albans, he, also, gained, control, of, the, parliamentary, constituency, of, st, albans, his, brother, george, held, the, seat, from, 1685, to, 1708, charles, churchill, served, at, the, danish, court, where, he, became, friends, with, prince, george, of, denmark, who, married, james, s, younger, daughter, anne, in, 1683, his, senior, aide, was, colonel, charles, griffin, brother, in, law, to, sarah, appointed, lady, of, the, bedchamber, to, anne, the, churchills, and, their, relatives, formed, a, central, part, of, the, so, called, cockpit, circle, of, anne, s, friends, named, after, her, apartments, in, whitehall, churchill, was, reportedly, concerned, at, being, too, closely, associated, with, james, particularly, since, sarah, s, sister, frances, was, married, to, irish, catholic, richard, talbot, appointed, lord, deputy, of, ireland, in, 1687, this, was, offset, by, their, connection, with, the, protestant, anne, while, sarah, herself, was, renowned, for, being, virulently, anti, catholic, despite, his, catholicism, james, succeeded, charles, as, king, in, february, 1685, with, widespread, support, many, feared, his, exclusion, would, lead, to, a, repetition, of, the, 1638, 1651, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, but, tolerance, for, his, personal, beliefs, did, not, apply, to, catholicism, in, general, his, support, collapsed, when, his, policies, appeared, to, threaten, the, primacy, of, the, church, of, england, and, created, the, instability, his, supporters, wished, to, avoid, this, preference, for, stability, led, to, the, rapid, defeat, in, june, 1685, of, argyll, s, rising, in, scotland, and, the, monmouth, rebellion, in, western, england, in, the, campaign, against, monmouth, churchill, led, the, infantry, under, the, command, of, the, earl, of, feversham, at, sedgemoor, on, 6, july, 1685, defeating, the, rebels, and, effectively, putting, an, end, to, the, rebellion, although, subordinate, to, feversham, churchill, s, administrative, capacity, tactical, skill, and, courage, in, battle, were, pivotal, in, the, victory, in, recognition, of, his, contribution, he, was, promoted, major, general, and, given, the, colonelcy, of, the, third, troop, of, life, guards, in, may, he, had, been, made, baron, churchill, of, sandridge, giving, him, a, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, which, led, to, the, first, open, breach, with, james, lord, delamere, was, accused, of, involvement, in, the, rebellion, and, tried, by, 30, members, of, the, house, of, lords, including, churchill, as, the, most, junior, peer, he, went, first, and, his, vote, for, acquittal, was, viewed, as, giving, a, lead, to, others, delamere, was, set, free, much, to, james, s, annoyance, as, early, as, 1682, churchill, was, recorded, as, being, uneasy, at, james, s, obstinacy, the, conviction, he, was, always, right, often, resulted, in, what, many, viewed, as, vindictive, behaviour, including, monmouth, s, clumsy, execution, and, the, persecution, of, his, followers, by, judge, jeffreys, this, provides, the, immediate, context, for, delamere, s, acquittal, but, shortly, after, the, coronation, churchill, reputedly, told, french, protestant, henri, de, massue, that, if, the, king, should, attempt, to, change, our, religion, i, will, instantly, quit, his, service, churchill, emerged, from, the, sedgemoor, campaign, with, great, credit, but, he, was, anxious, not, to, be, seen, as, sympathetic, towards, the, king, s, growing, religious, ardour, against, the, protestant, establishment, james, ii, s, promotion, of, catholics, in, royal, institutions, including, the, army, engendered, first, suspicion, and, ultimately, sedition, in, his, mainly, protestant, subjects, even, members, of, his, own, family, expressed, alarm, at, the, king, s, zeal, for, roman, catholicism, when, the, queen, gave, birth, to, a, son, james, francis, edward, stuart, it, opened, up, the, prospect, of, successive, catholic, monarchs, some, in, the, king, s, service, such, as, the, earl, of, salisbury, and, the, earl, of, melfort, converted, to, catholicism, and, were, seen, as, having, betrayed, their, protestant, upbringing, to, gain, favour, at, court, churchill, remained, true, to, his, conscience, telling, the, king, i, have, been, bred, a, protestant, and, intend, to, live, and, die, in, that, communion, although, he, was, also, motivated, by, self, interest, believing, that, the, monarch, s, policy, would, either, wreck, his, own, career, or, generate, a, wider, insurrection, he, did, not, intend, like, his, unfortunate, father, before, him, to, be, on, the, losing, side, seven, men, met, to, draft, the, invitation, to, the, protestant, dutch, stadtholder, william, prince, of, orange, to, invade, england, and, assume, the, throne, the, signatories, to, the, letter, included, whigs, tories, and, the, bishop, of, london, henry, compton, who, assured, the, prince, that, nineteen, parts, of, twenty, of, the, people, are, desirous, of, change, william, needed, no, further, encouragement, although, the, invitation, was, not, signed, by, churchill, he, was, not, as, yet, of, sufficient, political, rank, he, declared, his, intention, through, william, s, principal, english, contact, in, the, hague, if, you, think, there, is, anything, else, that, i, ought, to, do, you, have, but, to, command, me, william, landed, at, brixham, on, 5, november, 1688, o, s, from, there, he, moved, his, army, to, exeter, james, s, forces, once, again, commanded, by, lord, feversham, moved, to, salisbury, but, few, of, its, senior, officers, were, eager, to, fight, even, princess, anne, wrote, to, william, to, wish, him, good, success, in, this, so, just, an, undertaking, promoted, to, lieutenant, general, on, 7, november, o, s, churchill, was, still, at, the, king, s, side, but, his, displaying, the, greatest, transports, of, joy, imaginable, at, the, desertion, of, lord, cornbury, led, feversham, to, call, for, his, arrest, churchill, himself, had, openly, encouraged, defection, to, the, orangist, cause, but, james, continued, to, hesitate, soon, it, was, too, late, to, act, after, the, meeting, of, the, council, of, war, on, the, morning, of, 24, november, o, s, churchill, accompanied, by, some, 400, officers, and, men, slipped, from, the, royal, camp, and, rode, towards, william, in, axminster, leaving, behind, him, a, letter, of, apology, and, self, justification, i, hope, the, great, advantage, i, enjoy, under, your, majesty, which, i, own, i, would, never, expect, in, any, other, change, of, government, may, reasonably, convince, your, majesty, and, the, world, that, i, am, actuated, by, a, higher, principle, when, the, king, saw, that, he, could, not, keep, even, churchill, for, so, long, his, loyal, servant, he, despaired, james, ii, who, in, the, words, of, the, archbishop, of, rheims, had, given, up, three, kingdoms, for, a, mass, fled, to, france, taking, with, him, his, son, and, heir, as, part, of, william, iii, and, mary, ii, s, coronation, honours, churchill, was, created, earl, of, marlborough, on, 9, april, 1689, o, s, he, was, also, sworn, as, a, member, of, the, privy, council, and, made, a, gentleman, of, the, king, s, bedchamber, his, elevation, however, led, to, accusatory, rumours, from, king, james, s, supporters, that, marlborough, had, disgracefully, betrayed, his, erstwhile, king, for, personal, gain, william, himself, entertained, reservations, about, the, man, who, had, deserted, james, marlborough, s, apologists, including, his, biographer, and, most, notable, descendant, winston, churchill, have, been, at, pains, to, attribute, patriotic, religious, and, moral, motives, to, his, action, but, in, the, words, of, david, g, chandler, it, is, difficult, to, absolve, marlborough, of, ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue, and, treachery, against, a, man, to, whom, he, owed, virtually, everything, in, his, life, and, career, to, date, marlborough, s, first, official, act, was, to, assist, in, the, remodeling, of, the, army, the, power, of, confirming, or, purging, officers, and, men, allowed, the, earl, to, build, a, new, patronage, network, that, would, prove, beneficial, over, the, next, two, decades, his, task, was, urgent, for, less, than, six, months, after, james, ii, s, departure, england, joined, the, war, against, france, as, part, of, a, powerful, coalition, aimed, at, curtailing, the, ambitions, of, louis, xiv, with, his, experience, it, was, logical, that, marlborough, took, charge, of, the, 8, 000, english, troops, sent, to, the, low, countries, in, the, spring, of, 1689, yet, throughout, the, nine, years, war, 1688, 97, he, saw, only, three, years, service, in, the, field, and, then, mostly, in, subordinate, commands, however, at, the, battle, of, walcourt, on, 25, august, 1689, marlborough, won, praise, from, the, allied, commander, prince, waldeck, despite, his, youth, he, displayed, greater, military, capacity, than, do, most, generals, after, a, long, series, of, wars, he, is, assuredly, one, of, the, most, gallant, men, i, know, since, walcourt, though, marlborough, s, popularity, at, court, had, waned, william, and, mary, distrusted, both, lord, and, lady, marlborough, s, influence, as, confidants, and, supporters, of, princess, anne, whose, claim, to, the, throne, was, stronger, than, william, s, sarah, had, supported, anne, in, a, series, of, court, disputes, with, the, joint, monarchs, infuriating, mary, who, included, the, earl, in, her, disfavour, of, his, wife, yet, for, the, moment, the, clash, of, tempers, was, over, shadowed, by, more, pressing, events, in, ireland, where, james, had, landed, in, march, 1689, in, an, attempt, to, regain, his, thrones, when, william, left, for, ireland, in, june, 1690, marlborough, became, commander, of, all, troops, and, militia, in, england, and, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, council, of, nine, to, advise, mary, on, military, matters, in, the, king, s, absence, but, she, made, scant, effort, to, disguise, her, distaste, at, his, appointment, i, can, neither, trust, or, esteem, him, she, wrote, to, william, william, iii, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, on, 1, july, 1690, o, s, forced, james, ii, to, abandon, his, army, and, flee, back, to, france, in, august, marlborough, himself, left, for, ireland, engaged, upon, his, first, independent, command, a, land, sea, operation, upon, the, southern, ports, of, cork, and, kinsale, it, was, a, bold, imaginative, project, aimed, at, disrupting, jacobite, supply, routes, and, one, which, the, earl, conceived, and, executed, with, outstanding, success, cork, fell, on, 27, september, o, s, and, kinsale, followed, in, mid, october, although, the, campaign, did, not, end, the, war, in, ireland, as, marlborough, hoped, it, taught, him, the, significance, of, the, minutiae, of, logistics, and, the, importance, of, cooperation, and, tact, when, working, alongside, other, senior, allied, commanders, it, would, however, be, more, than, ten, years, before, he, once, again, took, charge, in, the, field, william, iii, recognised, marlborough, s, qualities, as, a, soldier, and, strategist, but, the, refusal, of, the, order, of, the, garter, and, failure, to, appoint, him, master, general, of, the, ordnance, rankled, with, the, ambitious, earl, nor, did, marlborough, conceal, his, bitter, disappointment, behind, his, usual, bland, discretion, using, his, influence, in, parliament, and, the, army, marlborough, aroused, dissatisfaction, concerning, william, s, preferences, for, foreign, commanders, an, exercise, designed, to, force, the, king, s, hand, aware, of, this, william, in, turn, began, to, speak, openly, of, his, distrust, of, marlborough, the, elector, of, brandenburg, s, envoy, to, london, overheard, the, king, remark, that, he, had, been, treated, so, infamously, by, marlborough, that, had, he, not, been, king, he, would, have, felt, it, necessary, to, challenge, him, to, a, duel, since, january, 1691, marlborough, had, been, in, contact, with, the, exiled, james, ii, in, saint, germain, anxious, to, obtain, the, erstwhile, king, s, pardon, for, deserting, him, in, 1688, a, pardon, essential, for, the, success, of, his, future, career, in, the, not, altogether, unlikely, event, of, a, jacobite, restoration, james, himself, maintained, contact, with, his, supporters, in, england, whose, principal, object, was, to, re, establish, him, upon, his, throne, william, was, well, aware, of, these, contacts, as, well, as, others, such, as, baron, godolphin, and, the, duke, of, shrewsbury, but, their, double, dealing, was, seen, more, like, an, insurance, policy, rather, than, as, an, explicit, commitment, marlborough, did, not, wish, for, a, jacobite, restoration, but, william, was, conscious, of, his, military, and, political, qualities, and, the, danger, the, earl, posed, william, was, not, prone, to, fear, wrote, thomas, macaulay, but, if, there, was, anyone, on, earth, that, he, feared, it, was, marlborough, by, the, time, william, and, marlborough, had, returned, from, an, uneventful, campaign, in, the, spanish, netherlands, in, october, 1691, their, relationship, had, further, deteriorated, in, january, 1692, the, queen, angered, by, marlborough, s, intrigues, in, parliament, the, army, and, even, with, saint, germain, ordered, anne, to, dismiss, sarah, from, her, household, anne, refused, this, personal, dispute, precipitated, marlborough, s, dismissal, on, 30, january, 1692, 20, january, 1691, o, s, the, earl, of, nottingham, secretary, of, state, ordered, marlborough, to, dispose, of, all, his, posts, and, offices, both, civil, and, military, and, consider, himself, dismissed, from, all, appointments, and, forbidden, the, court, no, reasons, were, given, but, marlborough, s, chief, associates, were, outraged, shrewsbury, voiced, his, disapproval, and, godolphin, threatened, to, retire, from, government, admiral, russell, now, commander, in, chief, of, the, navy, personally, accused, the, king, of, ingratitude, to, the, man, who, had, set, the, crown, upon, his, head, the, nadir, of, marlborough, s, fortunes, had, not, yet, been, reached, the, spring, of, 1692, brought, renewed, threats, of, a, french, invasion, and, new, accusations, of, jacobite, treachery, acting, on, the, testimony, of, one, robert, young, the, queen, had, arrested, all, the, signatories, to, a, letter, purporting, the, restoration, of, james, ii, and, the, seizure, of, william, iii, marlborough, as, one, of, these, signatories, was, sent, to, the, tower, of, london, on, 4, may, o, s, where, he, languished, for, five, weeks, his, anguish, compounded, by, the, news, of, the, death, of, his, younger, son, charles, on, 22, may, o, s, young, s, letters, were, eventually, discredited, as, forgeries, and, marlborough, was, released, on, 15, june, o, s, but, he, continued, his, correspondence, with, james, leading, to, the, celebrated, incident, of, the, camaret, bay, letter, of, 1694, for, several, months, the, allies, had, been, planning, an, attack, on, brest, the, french, port, in, the, west, of, brittany, the, french, had, received, intelligence, alerting, them, to, the, imminent, assault, enabling, marshal, vauban, to, strengthen, its, defences, and, reinforce, the, garrison, inevitably, the, attack, on, 18, june, led, by, thomas, tollemache, ended, in, disaster, most, of, his, men, were, killed, or, captured, and, tollemache, died, of, his, wounds, shortly, afterward, despite, lacking, evidence, marlborough, s, detractors, claimed, that, it, was, he, who, had, alerted, the, enemy, macaulay, states, that, in, a, letter, on, 3, may, 1694, marlborough, betrayed, the, allied, plans, to, james, thus, ensuring, that, the, landing, failed, and, that, tollemache, a, talented, rival, was, killed, or, discredited, as, a, direct, result, historians, such, as, john, paget, and, c, t, atkinson, conclude, that, he, probably, did, write, the, letter, but, did, so, only, when, he, knew, that, it, would, be, received, too, late, for, its, information, to, be, of, any, practical, use, the, plan, of, the, attack, on, brest, was, widely, known, and, the, french, had, already, begun, to, strengthen, their, defences, in, april, to, richard, holmes, the, evidence, linking, marlborough, with, the, camaret, bay, letter, which, no, longer, exists, is, slender, concluding, it, is, very, hard, to, imagine, a, man, as, careful, as, marlborough, only, recently, freed, from, suspicion, of, treason, writing, a, letter, which, would, kill, him, if, it, fell, into, the, wrong, hands, however, david, chandler, surmises, that, the, whole, episode, is, so, obscure, and, inconclusive, that, it, is, still, not, possible, to, make, a, definite, ruling, mary, s, death, on, 28, december, 1694, o, s, eventually, led, to, a, formal, but, cool, reconciliation, between, william, iii, and, anne, now, heir, to, the, throne, marlborough, hoped, that, the, rapprochement, would, lead, to, his, own, return, to, office, but, although, he, and, lady, marlborough, were, allowed, to, return, to, court, the, earl, received, no, offer, of, employment, in, 1696, marlborough, together, with, godolphin, russell, and, shrewsbury, was, yet, again, implicated, in, a, treasonous, plot, with, james, ii, this, time, instigated, by, the, jacobite, militant, john, fenwick, the, accusations, were, eventually, dismissed, as, a, fabrication, and, fenwick, executed, the, king, himself, had, remained, incredulous, but, it, was, not, until, 1698, a, year, after, the, treaty, of, ryswick, brought, an, end, to, the, nine, years, war, that, the, corner, was, finally, turned, in, william, s, and, marlborough, s, relationship, on, the, recommendation, of, lord, sunderland, whose, wife, was, a, close, friend, of, lady, marlborough, william, eventually, offered, marlborough, the, post, of, governor, to, the, duke, of, gloucester, anne, s, eldest, son, he, was, also, restored, to, the, privy, council, together, with, his, military, rank, when, william, left, for, holland, in, july, marlborough, was, one, of, the, lords, justices, left, running, the, government, in, his, absence, but, striving, to, reconcile, his, close, tory, connections, with, that, of, the, dutiful, royal, servant, was, difficult, leading, marlborough, to, complain, the, king, s, coldness, to, me, still, continues, in, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, single, most, important, theme, in, european, politics, was, the, rivalry, between, the, house, of, habsburg, and, the, house, of, bourbon, in, 1665, the, infirm, and, childless, habsburg, charles, ii, became, the, king, of, spain, spain, was, no, longer, the, dominant, global, power, it, once, was, but, remained, a, vast, global, confederation, with, possessions, in, italy, the, spanish, netherlands, the, philippines, and, large, parts, of, the, americas, it, proved, remarkably, resilient, when, charles, died, in, 1700, it, was, largely, intact, and, had, even, expanded, in, areas, like, the, pacific, its, possession, could, change, the, balance, of, power, in, favour, of, either, france, or, austria, attempts, to, partition, the, empire, between, the, french, and, austrian, candidates, or, install, an, alternative, from, the, bavarian, wittelsbach, dynasty, failed, when, charles, died, he, left, his, throne, to, louis, xiv, s, grandson, who, became, philip, v, of, spain, on, 16, november, 1700, however, this, was, on, condition, philip, renounced, his, claim, to, the, french, throne, louis, decision, to, ignore, this, once, again, threatened, french, domination, over, europe, and, led, to, the, grand, alliance, being, reformed, in, 1701, with, his, health, deteriorating, william, iii, appointed, marlborough, ambassador, extraordinary, and, commander, of, english, forces, to, attend, the, conference, at, the, hague, on, 7, september, 1701, the, treaty, of, the, second, grand, alliance, nominated, emperor, leopold, i, s, second, son, archduke, charles, as, king, of, spain, instead, of, phillip, it, was, signed, by, england, the, dutch, republic, and, the, holy, roman, empire, represented, by, emperor, leopold, i, head, of, the, austrian, habsburgs, however, the, increasing, independence, of, german, states, within, the, empire, meant, bavaria, now, allied, itself, with, france, william, iii, died, on, 8, march, 1702, o, s, from, injuries, sustained, in, a, riding, accident, and, was, succeeded, by, his, sister, in, law, anne, while, his, death, was, expected, it, deprived, the, alliance, of, its, most, obvious, leader, although, marlborough, s, personal, position, was, further, strengthened, by, his, close, relationship, with, the, new, queen, anne, appointed, him, master, general, of, the, ordnance, a, knight, of, the, garter, and, captain, general, of, her, armies, at, home, and, abroad, lady, marlborough, was, made, groom, of, the, stool, mistress, of, the, robes, and, keeper, of, the, privy, purse, giving, them, a, combined, annual, income, of, over, 60, 000, and, unrivaled, influence, at, court, during, the, war, marlborough, along, with, his, personal, friend, grand, pensionary, anthonie, heinsius, and, prince, eugene, of, savoy, would, come, to, form, the, triumvirate, that, in, various, respects, governed, europe, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, on, 4, may, 1702, o, s, england, formally, declared, war, on, france, marlborough, was, given, command, of, the, english, dutch, and, hired, german, forces, but, he, had, not, as, yet, commanded, a, large, army, in, the, field, and, had, far, less, experience, than, a, dozen, dutch, and, german, generals, who, now, had, to, work, under, him, moreover, to, the, dutch, he, was, a, foreigner, and, the, dutch, states, general, wanted, to, prevent, british, political, and, military, interests, from, being, prioritised, over, those, of, the, dutch, republic, the, states, general, thus, put, severe, limits, on, his, power, which, were, defined, in, 12, articles, the, most, notable, articles, stated, that, as, commander, of, anglo, dutch, forces, he, had, the, power, to, give, orders, to, dutch, generals, only, when, their, troops, were, in, action, with, his, own, at, all, other, times, he, had, to, rely, on, his, powers, of, tact, and, persuasion, and, gain, the, consent, of, accompanying, dutch, field, deputies, the, political, representatives, of, the, states, general, the, dutch, generals, and, deputies, were, concerned, by, the, threat, of, an, invasion, from, a, powerful, enemy, nevertheless, despite, his, allies, initial, lassitude, the, campaign, in, the, low, countries, the, war, s, principal, theatre, began, well, for, marlborough, after, outmanoeuvring, marshal, boufflers, he, captured, venlo, roermond, stevensweert, and, li, ge, for, which, in, december, a, grateful, queen, publicly, proclaimed, marlborough, a, duke, on, 9, february, 1703, o, s, soon, after, the, marlboroughs, elevation, their, daughter, elizabeth, married, scroop, egerton, earl, of, bridgewater, this, was, followed, in, the, summer, by, an, engagement, between, mary, and, john, montagu, heir, to, the, earl, of, and, later, duke, of, montagu, they, later, married, on, 20, march, 1705, o, s, their, two, older, daughters, were, already, married, henrietta, to, godolphin, s, son, francis, in, april, 1698, and, anne, to, the, hot, headed, and, intemperate, charles, spencer, earl, of, sunderland, in, 1700, however, marlborough, s, hopes, of, founding, a, great, dynasty, of, his, own, reposed, in, his, eldest, and, only, surviving, son, john, who, since, his, father, s, elevation, had, borne, the, courtesy, title, of, marquess, of, blandford, but, while, studying, at, cambridge, in, early, 1703, the, 17, year, old, was, stricken, with, severe, smallpox, his, parents, rushed, to, be, by, his, side, but, on, saturday, morning, 20, february, o, s, the, boy, died, plunging, the, duke, into, the, greatest, sorrow, in, the, world, bearing, his, grief, and, leaving, sarah, to, hers, the, duke, returned, to, the, hague, at, the, beginning, of, march, by, now, marshal, villeroi, had, replaced, boufflers, as, commander, in, the, spanish, netherlands, but, although, marlborough, was, able, to, take, bonn, huy, and, limbourg, in, 1703, the, great, design, the, anglo, dutch, plan, to, secure, antwerp, and, thereby, open, the, river, lines, into, flanders, and, brabant, was, left, in, ruins, by, villeroi, s, initiative, and, poor, allied, co, ordination, resulting, in, the, near, disaster, at, the, battle, of, ekeren, on, 30, june, domestically, the, duke, also, encountered, problems, the, moderate, tory, ministry, of, marlborough, the, lord, treasurer, godolphin, and, the, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, robert, harley, were, hampered, by, and, often, at, variance, with, their, high, tory, colleagues, whose, strategic, policy, favoured, the, full, employment, of, the, royal, navy, in, pursuit, of, trade, advantages, and, colonial, expansion, overseas, to, the, tories, an, action, at, sea, was, preferable, to, one, ashore, rather, than, attack, the, enemy, where, they, were, strongest, the, tories, proposed, to, attack, louis, xiv, and, philip, v, where, they, were, weakest, in, their, colonial, empires, and, on, the, high, seas, in, contrast, the, whigs, led, by, their, junto, enthusiastically, supported, the, ministry, s, continental, strategy, of, thrusting, the, army, into, the, heart, of, france, this, support, wilted, somewhat, following, the, allies, recent, campaign, but, the, duke, whose, diplomatic, tact, had, held, together, a, very, discordant, grand, alliance, was, now, a, general, of, international, repute, and, the, limited, success, of, 1703, was, soon, eclipsed, by, the, blenheim, campaign, pressed, by, the, french, and, bavarians, to, the, west, and, hungarian, rebels, to, the, east, austria, faced, the, real, possibility, of, being, forced, out, of, the, war, concerns, over, vienna, and, the, situation, in, southern, germany, convinced, marlborough, of, the, necessity, of, sending, aid, to, the, danube, but, the, scheme, of, seizing, the, initiative, from, the, enemy, was, extremely, bold, from, the, start, the, duke, resolved, to, mislead, the, dutch, states, general, who, would, never, willingly, permit, any, major, weakening, of, allied, forces, in, the, spanish, netherlands, to, this, end, marlborough, moved, english, and, dutch, troops, to, the, moselle, a, plan, approved, of, by, the, hague, but, once, there, he, planned, to, slip, the, dutch, leash, and, march, south, to, link, up, with, austrian, forces, in, southern, germany, the, dutch, grand, pensionary, anthonie, heinsius, was, likely, informed, by, marlborough, of, this, secret, plan, beforehand, a, combination, of, strategic, deception, and, brilliant, administration, enabled, marlborough, to, achieve, his, purpose, after, marching, 250, miles, 400, km, from, the, low, countries, the, allies, fought, a, series, of, engagements, against, the, franco, bavarian, forces, ranged, against, them, on, the, danube, the, first, major, encounter, occurred, on, 2, july, 1704, when, marlborough, and, prince, louis, of, baden, stormed, the, schellenberg, heights, at, donauw, rth, however, the, main, event, followed, on, 13, august, when, marlborough, assisted, by, the, imperial, commander, the, able, prince, eugene, of, savoy, delivered, a, crushing, defeat, on, marshal, tallard, s, and, the, elector, of, bavaria, s, army, at, the, battle, of, blenheim, the, whole, campaign, which, historian, john, a, lynn, describes, as, one, of, the, greatest, examples, of, marching, and, fighting, before, napoleon, had, been, a, model, of, planning, logistics, tactical, and, operational, skill, the, successful, outcome, of, which, had, altered, the, course, of, the, conflict, bavaria, was, knocked, out, of, the, war, and, louis, xiv, s, hopes, of, an, early, victory, were, destroyed, with, the, subsequent, fall, of, landau, on, the, rhine, and, trier, and, trarbach, on, the, moselle, marlborough, now, stood, as, the, foremost, soldier, of, the, age, even, the, tories, who, had, declared, that, should, he, fail, they, would, break, him, up, like, hounds, on, a, hare, could, not, entirely, restrain, their, patriotic, admiration, the, queen, lavished, upon, her, favourite, the, royal, manor, of, woodstock, and, the, promise, of, a, fine, palace, commemorative, of, his, great, victory, at, blenheim, but, since, her, accession, her, relationship, with, sarah, had, become, progressively, distant, the, duke, and, duchess, had, risen, to, greatness, not, least, because, of, their, intimacy, with, anne, but, the, duchess, s, relentless, campaign, against, the, tories, sarah, was, a, firm, whig, isolated, her, from, the, queen, whose, natural, inclinations, lay, with, the, tories, the, staunch, supporters, of, the, church, of, england, for, her, part, anne, now, queen, and, no, longer, the, timid, adolescent, so, easily, dominated, by, her, more, beautiful, friend, had, grown, tired, of, sarah, s, tactless, political, hectoring, and, increasingly, haughty, manner, which, in, the, coming, years, were, to, destroy, their, friendship, and, undermine, the, position, of, her, husband, during, the, duke, s, march, to, the, danube, emperor, leopold, i, offered, to, make, marlborough, a, prince, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, small, principality, of, mindelheim, the, queen, enthusiastically, agreed, to, this, elevation, but, after, the, successes, of, 1704, the, campaign, of, 1705, brought, little, reason, for, satisfaction, on, the, continent, the, planned, invasion, of, france, via, the, moselle, valley, was, frustrated, by, friend, and, foe, alike, forcing, the, duke, to, withdraw, back, towards, the, low, countries, although, marlborough, penetrated, the, lines, of, brabant, at, elixheim, in, july, indecision, and, dutch, objections, concerned, as, they, were, for, the, security, of, their, homeland, prevented, the, duke, from, attacking, the, french, at, the, dyle, the, french, and, the, tories, in, england, dismissed, arguments, that, only, dutch, obstructionism, had, robbed, marlborough, of, a, great, victory, in, 1705, confirmed, in, their, belief, that, blenheim, had, been, a, chance, occurrence, and, that, marlborough, was, a, general, not, to, be, feared, the, early, months, of, 1706, also, proved, frustrating, for, the, duke, as, louis, xiv, s, generals, gained, early, successes, in, italy, and, alsace, these, setbacks, thwarted, marlborough, s, original, plans, for, the, coming, campaign, but, he, soon, adjusted, his, schemes, and, marched, into, enemy, territory, louis, xiv, equally, determined, to, fight, and, avenge, blenheim, goaded, his, commander, marshal, villeroi, to, seek, out, monsieur, marlbrouck, the, subsequent, battle, of, ramillies, fought, in, the, spanish, netherlands, on, 23, may, was, perhaps, marlborough, s, most, successful, action, and, one, in, which, he, had, himself, characteristically, drawn, his, sword, at, the, pivotal, moment, for, the, loss, of, fewer, than, 5, 000, dead, and, wounded, far, fewer, than, blenheim, his, victory, had, cost, the, enemy, some, 15, 000, casualties, inflicting, in, the, words, of, marshal, villars, the, most, shameful, humiliating, and, disastrous, of, routs, the, campaign, was, an, unsurpassed, operational, triumph, for, the, english, general, town, after, town, subsequently, fell, to, the, allies, it, really, looks, more, like, a, dream, than, truth, wrote, marlborough, to, sarah, while, marlborough, fought, in, the, low, countries, a, series, of, personal, and, party, rivalries, instigated, a, general, reversal, of, fortune, the, whigs, who, were, the, main, prop, of, the, war, had, been, laying, siege, to, godolphin, as, a, price, for, supporting, the, government, in, the, next, parliamentary, session, the, whigs, demanded, a, share, of, public, office, with, the, appointment, of, a, leading, member, of, their, junto, the, earl, of, sunderland, marlborough, s, son, in, law, to, the, post, of, secretary, of, state, the, queen, who, loathed, sunderland, and, the, junto, and, who, refused, to, be, dominated, by, any, single, party, bitterly, opposed, the, move, but, godolphin, increasingly, dependent, on, whig, support, had, little, room, for, manoeuvre, with, sarah, s, tactless, unsubtle, backing, godolphin, relentlessly, pressed, the, queen, to, submit, to, whig, demands, in, despair, anne, finally, relented, and, sunderland, received, the, seals, of, office, but, the, special, relationship, between, godolphin, sarah, and, the, queen, had, taken, a, severe, blow, and, she, began, to, turn, increasingly, to, a, new, favourite, sarah, s, cousin, abigail, masham, anne, also, became, ever, more, reliant, on, the, advice, of, harley, who, was, convinced, that, the, duumvirate, s, policy, of, appeasing, the, whig, junto, was, unnecessary, had, set, himself, up, as, an, alternative, source, of, advice, to, a, sympathetic, queen, following, his, victory, at, ramillies, marlborough, returned, to, england, and, the, acclamation, of, parliament, his, titles, and, estates, were, made, perpetual, upon, his, heirs, male, or, female, so, the, memory, of, these, deeds, should, never, lack, one, of, his, name, to, bear, it, however, the, allied, successes, were, followed, in, 1707, with, a, resurgence, in, french, arms, on, all, fronts, of, the, war, and, a, return, to, political, squabbling, and, indecision, within, the, grand, alliance, the, great, northern, war, also, threatened, dire, consequences, the, french, had, hoped, to, entice, king, charles, xii, of, sweden, to, attack, the, empire, regarding, grievances, over, the, polish, succession, in, a, pre, campaign, visit, to, the, king, s, headquarters, at, altranst, dt, marlborough, s, diplomacy, helped, placate, charles, and, prevent, his, interference, regarding, the, spanish, succession, following, the, 1706, treaty, of, altranst, dt, tsar, peter, the, great, of, russia, unsuccessfully, offered, the, yet, to, be, conquered, polish, crown, to, marlborough, among, other, candidates, in, altranst, dt, marlborough, reportedly, approached, carl, piper, the, most, favoured, of, the, king, s, advisers, allegedly, he, offered, piper, a, pension, in, exchange, for, advising, charles, xii, to, launch, an, invasion, of, russia, as, this, would, distract, charles, from, interfering, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, carl, piper, was, accused, of, having, accepted, marlborough, s, bribe, advising, charles, to, invade, russia, carl, piper, denied, having, accepted, marlborough, s, offer, but, he, did, admit, that, marlborough, provided, his, wife, christina, piper, with, a, pair, of, valuable, earrings, which, she, accepted, and, it, was, the, habit, of, carl, to, personally, refuse, bribes, but, allow, his, wife, to, accept, them, and, then, follow, her, advice, nevertheless, major, setbacks, in, spain, at, almansa, and, along, the, rhine, in, southern, germany, had, caused, marlborough, great, anxiety, prince, eugene, s, retreat, from, toulon, marlborough, s, major, goal, for, 1707, ended, any, lingering, hopes, of, a, war, winning, blow, that, year, marlborough, returned, from, these, tribulations, to, a, political, storm, as, the, ministry, s, critics, turned, to, attack, the, overall, conduct, of, the, war, the, duke, and, godolphin, had, initially, agreed, to, explore, a, moderate, scheme, with, harley, and, reconstruct, the, government, but, they, were, incensed, when, harley, privately, criticised, the, management, of, the, war, in, spain, to, the, queen, and, his, associate, henry, st, john, the, secretary, at, war, raised, the, issue, in, parliament, convinced, of, harley, s, caballing, the, duumvirs, threatened, the, queen, with, resignation, unless, she, dismissed, him, anne, fought, stubbornly, to, keep, her, favourite, minister, but, when, the, duke, of, somerset, and, the, earl, of, pembroke, refused, to, act, without, the, general, nor, the, treasurer, harley, resigned, henry, boyle, replaced, him, as, secretary, of, state, and, his, fellow, whig, robert, walpole, replaced, st, john, as, secretary, at, war, the, struggle, had, given, marlborough, a, final, lease, of, power, but, it, was, a, whig, victory, and, he, had, to, a, large, extent, lost, his, hold, on, the, queen, the, military, setbacks, of, 1707, continued, through, the, opening, months, of, 1708, with, the, defection, of, bruges, and, ghent, to, the, french, marlborough, remained, despondent, about, the, general, situation, but, his, optimism, received, a, major, boost, with, the, arrival, in, theatre, of, prince, eugene, his, co, commander, at, blenheim, heartened, by, the, prince, s, robust, confidence, marlborough, set, about, to, regain, the, strategic, initiative, after, a, forced, march, the, allies, crossed, the, river, schelde, at, oudenaarde, just, as, the, french, army, under, marshal, vend, me, and, the, duc, de, burgundy, was, crossing, farther, north, with, the, intent, of, besieging, the, place, marlborough, with, renewed, self, assurance, moved, decisively, to, engage, them, his, subsequent, victory, at, the, battle, of, oudenaarde, on, 11, july, 1708, demoralised, the, french, army, in, flanders, his, eye, for, ground, his, sense, of, timing, and, his, keen, knowledge, of, the, enemy, were, again, amply, demonstrated, the, success, aided, by, the, dissension, of, the, two, french, commanders, restored, the, strategic, initiative, to, the, allies, who, now, opted, to, besiege, lille, the, strongest, fortress, in, europe, while, the, duke, commanded, the, covering, force, eugene, oversaw, the, siege, of, the, town, which, surrendered, on, 22, october, however, it, was, not, until, 10, december, that, the, resolute, boufflers, yielded, the, citadel, yet, for, all, the, difficulties, of, the, winter, siege, the, campaign, of, 1708, had, been, a, remarkable, success, requiring, superior, logistical, skill, and, organisation, the, allies, re, took, brugge, and, gent, and, the, french, were, driven, out, of, almost, all, the, spanish, netherlands, while, marlborough, achieved, honours, on, the, battlefield, the, whigs, now, in, the, ascendancy, drove, the, remaining, tories, from, the, cabinet, marlborough, and, godolphin, now, distanced, from, anne, would, henceforth, have, to, conform, to, the, decisions, of, a, whig, ministry, while, the, tories, sullen, and, vengeful, looked, forward, to, their, former, leaders, downfall, to, compound, his, troubles, the, duchess, spurred, on, by, her, hatred, of, harley, and, abigail, had, finally, driven, the, queen, to, distraction, and, wrecked, what, was, left, of, their, friendship, sarah, was, retained, in, her, court, position, out, of, necessity, as, the, price, to, be, paid, to, keep, her, victorious, husband, at, the, head, of, the, army, after, the, recent, defeats, and, one, of, the, worst, winters, in, modern, history, france, was, on, the, brink, of, collapse, however, allied, demands, at, the, peace, talks, in, the, hague, in, april, 1709, principally, concerning, article, 37, that, bound, louis, xiv, to, hand, over, spain, within, two, months, or, face, the, renewal, of, the, war, were, rejected, by, the, french, in, june, the, whigs, the, dutch, marlborough, and, eugene, failed, for, personal, and, political, reasons, to, secure, a, favourable, peace, adhering, to, the, uncompromising, slogan, no, peace, without, spain, without, any, clear, knowledge, of, how, to, accomplish, it, all, the, while, harley, maintained, up, the, backstairs, by, abigail, rallied, the, moderates, to, his, side, ready, to, play, an, ambitious, and, powerful, middle, part, marlborough, returned, to, campaigning, in, the, low, countries, in, june, 1709, after, outwitting, marshal, villars, to, take, the, town, of, tournai, on, 3, september, a, major, and, bloody, operation, the, allies, turned, their, attention, upon, mons, determined, to, maintain, the, ceaseless, pressure, on, the, french, with, direct, orders, from, the, increasingly, desperate, louis, xiv, to, save, the, city, villars, advanced, on, the, tiny, village, of, malplaquet, on, 9, september, 1709, and, entrenched, his, position, two, days, later, the, opposing, forces, clashed, in, battle, on, the, allied, left, flank, the, prince, of, orange, led, his, dutch, infantry, in, desperate, charges, only, to, have, it, cut, to, pieces, on, the, other, flank, eugene, attacked, and, suffered, almost, as, severely, nevertheless, sustained, pressure, on, his, extremities, forced, villars, to, weaken, his, centre, enabling, marlborough, to, break, through, and, claim, victory, yet, the, cost, was, high, the, allied, casualty, figures, were, approximately, double, that, of, the, enemy, sources, vary, leading, marlborough, to, admit, the, french, have, defended, themselves, better, in, this, action, than, in, any, battle, i, ve, seen, a, rumour, among, the, french, about, marlborough, s, death, in, this, battle, lead, to, the, burlesque, lament, marlbrough, s, en, va, t, en, guerre, marlborough, has, left, for, the, war, the, duke, proceeded, to, take, mons, on, 20, october, but, on, his, return, to, england, his, enemies, used, the, malplaquet, casualty, figures, to, sully, his, reputation, harley, now, master, of, the, tory, party, did, all, he, could, to, persuade, his, colleagues, that, the, pro, war, whigs, and, by, their, apparent, concord, with, whig, policy, marlborough, and, godolphin, were, bent, on, leading, the, country, to, ruin, the, allies, had, confidently, expected, that, victory, in, a, major, set, piece, battle, would, compel, louis, xiv, to, accept, peace, on, allied, terms, but, after, malplaquet, the, bloodiest, battle, of, the, war, that, strategy, had, lost, its, validity, villars, had, only, to, avoid, defeat, for, a, compromise, peace, settlement, to, become, inevitable, in, march, 1710, fresh, peace, talks, re, opened, at, geertruidenberg, but, again, louis, xiv, would, not, concede, whig, demands, to, force, his, grandson, philip, v, from, spain, publicly, marlborough, toed, the, government, line, but, privately, he, had, real, doubts, about, pressing, the, french, into, accepting, such, a, dishonourable, course, although, the, duke, was, only, an, observer, at, geertruidenberg, the, failed, negotiations, gave, credence, to, his, detractors, that, he, was, deliberately, prolonging, the, war, for, his, own, profit, yet, it, was, with, reluctance, that, he, returned, to, campaigning, in, the, spring, capturing, douai, in, june, before, taking, b, thune, and, saint, venant, followed, in, november, by, aire, sur, la, lys, nevertheless, support, for, the, pro, war, policy, of, the, whigs, had, by, this, time, ebbed, away, the, cabinet, had, long, lacked, cohesion, and, mutual, trust, particularly, following, the, sacheverell, affair, when, in, the, summer, the, plan, to, break, it, up, prepared, by, harley, was, brought, into, action, by, the, queen, sunderland, was, dismissed, in, june, followed, by, godolphin, who, had, refused, to, sever, his, ties, with, sarah, in, august, others, followed, the, result, of, the, general, election, in, october, was, a, tory, landslide, and, a, victory, for, the, peace, policy, marlborough, remained, at, the, head, of, the, army, however, the, defeated, junto, the, dutch, eugene, and, the, emperor, implored, him, to, stand, by, the, common, cause, while, the, new, ministers, knowing, they, had, to, fight, another, campaign, required, him, to, maintain, the, pressure, on, the, enemy, until, they, had, made, their, own, arrangements, for, the, peace, the, duke, much, thinner, and, greatly, altered, returned, to, england, in, november, his, relationship, with, anne, had, suffered, further, setbacks, in, recent, months, she, had, refused, to, grant, him, his, requested, appointment, of, captain, general, for, life, and, had, interfered, in, military, appointments, the, damage, done, to, marlborough, s, general, standing, was, substantial, because, it, was, so, visible, for, now, though, the, central, issue, was, the, duchess, whose, growing, resentment, of, harley, and, abigail, had, finally, persuaded, the, queen, to, be, rid, of, her, marlborough, visited, anne, on, 17, january, 1711, o, s, in, a, last, attempt, to, save, his, wife, but, she, was, not, to, be, swayed, and, demanded, sarah, give, up, her, gold, key, the, symbol, of, her, office, within, two, days, warning, i, will, talk, of, no, other, business, till, i, have, the, key, notwithstanding, all, this, turmoil, and, his, declining, health, marlborough, returned, to, the, hague, in, late, february, to, prepare, for, what, was, to, be, his, last, campaign, and, one, of, his, greatest, once, again, marlborough, and, villars, formed, against, each, other, in, line, of, battle, this, time, along, the, avesnes, le, comte, arras, sector, of, the, lines, of, ne, plus, ultra, expecting, another, onslaught, on, the, scale, of, malplaquet, the, allied, generals, surmised, that, their, commander, distressed, from, domestic, turmoil, was, leading, them, to, an, appalling, slaughter, by, an, exercise, of, brilliant, psychological, deception, and, a, secretive, night, march, covering, nearly, 40, miles, in, 18, hours, the, allies, penetrated, the, allegedly, impregnable, lines, without, losing, a, single, man, marlborough, was, now, in, position, to, besiege, the, fortress, of, bouchain, villars, deceived, and, outmanoeuvred, was, helpless, to, intervene, compelling, the, fortress, s, unconditional, surrender, on, 12, september, chandler, writes, the, pure, military, artistry, with, which, he, repeatedly, deceived, villars, during, the, first, part, of, the, campaign, has, few, equals, in, the, annals, of, military, history, the, subsequent, siege, of, bouchain, with, all, its, technical, complexities, was, an, equally, fine, demonstration, of, martial, superiority, marlborough, s, strategic, gains, in, 1711, made, it, virtually, certain, that, the, allies, would, march, on, paris, the, following, year, but, harley, had, no, intention, of, letting, the, war, progress, that, far, and, risk, jeopardising, the, favourable, terms, secured, from, the, secret, anglo, french, talks, based, on, the, idea, that, philip, v, would, remain, on, the, spanish, throne, that, had, proceeded, throughout, the, year, marlborough, had, long, had, doubts, about, the, whig, policy, of, no, peace, without, spain, but, he, was, reluctant, to, abandon, his, allies, including, the, elector, of, hanover, anne, s, heir, presumptive, and, sided, with, the, whigs, in, opposing, the, peace, preliminaries, personal, entreaties, from, the, queen, who, had, long, tired, of, the, war, failed, to, persuade, the, duke, the, elector, made, it, clear, that, he, too, was, against, the, proposals, and, publicly, sided, with, the, whigs, nevertheless, anne, remained, resolute, and, on, 7, december, 1711, o, s, she, was, able, to, announce, that, notwithstanding, those, who, delight, in, the, arts, of, war, a, sneer, towards, marlborough, both, time, and, place, are, appointed, for, opening, the, treaty, of, a, general, peace, to, prevent, the, serious, renewal, of, warfare, in, the, spring, it, was, considered, essential, to, replace, marlborough, with, a, general, more, in, touch, with, the, queen, s, ministers, and, less, in, touch, with, their, allies, to, do, this, harley, newly, created, earl, of, oxford, and, st, john, first, needed, to, bring, charges, of, corruption, against, the, duke, completing, the, anti, whig, anti, war, picture, that, jonathan, swift, was, already, presenting, to, a, credulous, public, through, his, pamphleteering, notably, in, his, conduct, of, the, allies, 1711, two, main, charges, were, brought, to, the, house, of, commons, against, marlborough, first, an, assertion, that, over, nine, years, he, had, illegally, received, more, than, 63, 000, from, the, bread, and, transport, contractors, in, the, netherlands, second, that, he, had, taken, 2, 5, from, the, pay, of, the, foreign, troops, in, english, pay, amounting, to, 280, 000, despite, marlborough, s, refutations, claiming, ancient, precedent, for, the, first, allegation, and, for, the, second, producing, a, warrant, signed, by, the, queen, in, 1702, authorising, him, to, make, the, deductions, instead, of, secret, service, money, for, the, war, the, findings, were, enough, for, harley, to, persuade, the, queen, to, release, her, captain, general, on, 29, december, 1711, o, s, before, the, charges, had, been, examined, anne, who, owed, to, him, the, success, and, glory, of, her, reign, sent, her, letter, of, dismissal, i, am, sorry, for, your, own, sake, the, reasons, have, become, so, public, which, makes, it, necessary, for, me, to, let, you, know, you, have, rendered, it, impracticable, for, you, to, continue, yet, longer, in, my, service, the, tory, dominated, parliament, concluded, by, a, substantial, majority, that, the, taking, of, several, sums, of, money, annually, by, the, duke, of, marlborough, from, the, contractor, for, foraging, the, bread, and, wagons, was, unwarrantable, and, illegal, and, that, the, 2, 5, deducted, from, the, pay, of, foreign, troops, is, public, money, and, ought, to, be, accounted, for, when, his, successor, the, duke, of, ormonde, left, london, for, the, hague, to, take, command, of, british, forces, he, went, noted, bishop, burnet, with, the, same, allowances, that, had, been, lately, voted, criminal, in, the, duke, of, marlborough, the, allies, were, stunned, by, marlborough, s, dismissal, the, french, however, rejoiced, at, the, removal, of, the, main, obstacle, to, the, anglo, french, talks, oxford, i, e, harley, and, st, john, had, no, intention, of, letting, britain, s, new, captain, general, undertake, any, action, and, issued, ormonde, his, restraining, orders, in, may, forbidding, him, to, use, british, troops, in, action, against, the, french, an, infamous, step, that, ultimately, ruined, eugene, s, campaign, in, flanders, marlborough, continued, to, make, his, views, known, but, he, was, in, trouble, attacked, by, his, enemies, and, the, government, press, with, his, fortune, in, peril, and, blenheim, palace, still, unfinished, and, running, out, of, money, and, with, england, split, between, hanoverian, and, jacobite, factions, marlborough, thought, it, wise, to, leave, the, country, after, attending, godolphin, s, funeral, on, 7, october, o, s, he, went, into, voluntary, exile, to, the, continent, on, 1, december, 1712, o, s, marlborough, was, welcomed, and, f, ted, by, the, people, and, courts, of, europe, where, he, was, not, only, respected, as, a, great, general, but, also, as, a, prince, of, the, holy, roman, empire, sarah, joined, him, in, february, 1713, and, was, delighted, when, on, reaching, frankfurt, in, the, middle, of, may, to, see, that, the, troops, under, eugene, s, command, paid, her, lord, all, the, respects, as, if, he, had, been, at, his, old, post, churchill, was, described, as, having, been, about, the, middle, height, and, has, the, best, figure, in, the, world, his, features, are, without, fault, fine, sparkling, eyes, and, good, teeth, in, short, apart, from, his, legs, which, are, too, thin, he, is, one, of, the, handsomest, men, ever, seen, his, ambition, knows, no, bounds, throughout, his, travels, marlborough, remained, in, close, contact, with, the, electoral, court, of, hanover, determined, to, ensure, a, bloodless, hanoverian, succession, on, anne, s, death, he, also, maintained, correspondence, with, the, jacobites, the, spirit, of, the, age, saw, little, wrong, in, marlborough, s, continuing, friendship, with, his, nephew, the, duke, of, berwick, james, ii, s, illegitimate, son, with, arabella, but, these, assurances, against, a, jacobite, restoration, which, he, had, been, taking, out, since, the, early, years, of, william, iii, no, matter, how, insincere, stirred, hanoverian, suspicions, and, perhaps, prevented, him, from, holding, the, first, place, in, the, counsels, of, the, future, george, i, the, representatives, of, france, great, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, signed, the, treaty, of, utrecht, on, 11, april, 1713, n, s, the, emperor, and, his, german, allies, including, the, elector, of, hanover, continued, with, the, war, before, finally, accepting, the, general, settlement, the, following, year, the, treaty, marked, britain, s, emergence, as, a, great, power, domestically,

their, mutual, enmity, and, political, squabbling, had, effectively, wrecked, the, tory, administration, marlborough, had, been, kept, well, informed, of, events, while, in, exile, and, had, remained, a, powerful, figure, on, the, political, scene, not, least, because, of, the, personal, attachment, the, queen, still, retained, for, him, after, the, death, of, his, daughter, elizabeth, from, smallpox, in, march, 1714, marlborough, contacted, the, queen, although, the, contents, of, the, letter, are, unknown, anne, may, likely, have, summoned, him, home, either, way, it, seems, that, an, agreement, was, reached, to, reinstate, the, duke, in, his, former, offices, oxford, s, period, of, predominance, was, now, at, an, end, and, anne, turned, to, bolingbroke, and, marlborough, to, assume, the, reins, of, government, and, ensure, a, smooth, succession, but, beneath, the, weight, of, hostility, the, queen, s, health, already, fragile, rapidly, deteriorated, and, on, 1, august,

had, proved, incapable, of, action, what, daniel, defoe, called, the, solidity, of, the, constitution, had, triumphed, and, the, regents, chosen, by, george, prepared, for, his, arrival, the, duke, s, return, to, favour, under, the, house, of, hanover, enabled, him, to, preside, over, the, defeat, of, the, 1715, jacobite, rising, from, london, although, it, was, his, former, assistant, cadogan, who, directed, the, operations, but, his, health, was, fading, and, on, 28, may, 1716, o, s, shortly, after, the, death, of, his, daughter, anne, countess, of, sunderland, he, suffered, a, paralytic, stroke, at, holywell, house, this, was, followed, by, another, more, serious, stroke, in, november, this, time, at, a, house, on, the, blenheim, estate, the, duke, recovered, somewhat, his, speech, had, become, slightly, impaired, but, it, was, not, severe, and, continued, to, improve, over, time, and, his, mind, remained, as, sharp, and, clear, as, ever, he, recovered, enough, to, ride, out, to, watch, the, builders, at, work, on, blenheim, palace, and, attend, the, lords, to, vote, for, oxford, s, impeachment, in, 1719, the, duke, and, duchess, were, able, to, move, into, the, east, wing, of, the, unfinished, palace, but, marlborough, had, only, three, years, to, enjoy, it, while, living, at, windsor, lodge, he, suffered, another, stroke, in, june, 1722, not, long, after, his, 72nd, birthday, and, slipped, into, a, coma, finally, at, 4, a, m, on, 16, june, o, s, in, the, presence, of, his, wife, and, two, surviving, daughters, henrietta, godolphin, and, mary, montagu, the, 1st, duke, of, marlborough, died, he, was, initially, buried, on, 9, august, o, s, in, the, vault, at, the, east, end, of, the, henry, vii, chapel, in, westminster, abbey, but, following, instructions, left, by, sarah, who, died, in, 1744, marlborough, was, moved, to, be, by, her, side, lying, in, the, vault, beneath, the, chapel, at, blenheim, one, newspaper, described, how, the, occasion, was, celebrated, with, unparallel, d, magnificence, a, fitting, end, for, he, who, surpass, d, all, the, heroes, of, antiquity, historian, john, h, lavalle, argues, that, marlborough, s, place, as, one, of, the, finest, soldiers, britain, ever, produced, is, well, deserved, he, possessed, the, personal, courage, imagination, common, sense, self, control, and, quick, wits, that, mark, the, best, battlefield, commanders, he, had, an, unerring, ability, to, sense, an, enemy, s, weaknesses, and, the, ability, to, use, stratagems, to, throw, his, enemy, off, balance, it, was, in, the, realm, of, strategy, however, where, marlborough, shone, as, commander, in, chief, of, a, coalition, army, he, could, tolerate, politicians, allies, and, fools, gladly, he, also, saw, the, potential, of, the, recently, introduced, combination, of, flintlock, and, socket, bayonet, to, restore, the, offensive, to, warfare, in, an, age, when, extensive, fortifications, magazines, and, the, defensive, dominated, military, thinking, marlborough, s, attention, to, logistics, allowed, him, to, break, free, of, the, bonds, of, the, magazine, system, and, ensured, that, his, soldiers, were, fed, clothed, and, paid, earning, him, the, loyalty, of, his, troops, and, the, nickname, corporal, john, marlborough, was, equally, adept, at, both, battle, and, siege, robert, parker, writes, in, the, ten, campaigns, he, made, against, during, all, which, time, it, cannot, be, said, that, he, ever, slipped, an, opportunity, of, fighting, when, there, was, any, probability, of, coming, at, his, enemy, and, upon, all, occasions, he, concerted, matters, with, so, much, judgment, and, forecast, that, he, never, fought, a, battle, which, he, did, not, gain, nor, laid, siege, to, a, town, which, he, did, not, take, to, military, historians, david, chandler, and, richard, holmes, marlborough, is, the, greatest, british, commander, in, history, an, assessment, that, is, shared, by, others, including, the, duke, of, wellington, who, could, conceive, nothing, greater, than, marlborough, at, the, head, of, an, english, army, however, the, 19th, century, whig, historian, thomas, macaulay, denigrated, marlborough, throughout, the, pages, of, his, history, of, england, in, the, words, of, historian, john, wilson, croker, he, pursued, the, duke, with, more, than, the, ferocity, and, much, less, than, the, sagacity, of, a, bloodhound, though, according, to, g, m, trevelyan, macaulay, instinctively, desired, to, make, marlborough, s, genius, stand, out, bright, against, the, background, of, his, villainy, it, was, largely, in, response, to, macaulay, that, a, descendant, winston, churchill, wrote, his, laudatory, biography, marlborough, his, life, and, times, 4, vol, 1933, 1938, marlborough, was, ruthlessly, ambitious, and, relentless, in, the, pursuit, of, wealth, power, and, social, advancement, earning, him, a, reputation, for, avarice, and, miserliness, these, traits, may, have, been, exaggerated, for, party, faction, but, notes, trevelyan, nearly, all, other, statesmen, of, the, day, were, engaged, in, founding, families, and, amassing, estates, at, the, public, expense, marlborough, only, differed, in, that, he, gave, the, public, much, more, value, for, their, money, in, his, quest, for, fame, and, personal, interests, he, could, be, unscrupulous, as, his, desertion, of, james, ii, testifies, to, macaulay, this, is, regarded, as, a, piece, of, selfish, treachery, against, his, patron, an, analysis, shared, by, g, k, chesterton, a, devout, catholic, churchill, as, if, to, add, something, ideal, to, his, imitation, of, iscariot, went, to, james, with, wanton, professions, of, love, and, loyalty, and, then, calmly, handed, over, the, army, to, the, invader, to, the, finish, of, this, work, of, art, but, few, could, aspire, but, to, their, degree, all, the, politicians, of, the, revolution, were, upon, this, ethical, pattern, to, trevelyan, marlborough, s, behaviour, during, the, 1688, revolution, was, a, sign, of, his, devotion, to, the, liberties, of, england, and, the, protestant, religion, however, his, continuing, correspondence, with, saint, germain, was, not, noble, although, marlborough, did, not, wish, for, a, jacobite, restoration, his, double, dealing, ensured, that, william, iii, and, george, i, would, never, be, fully, disposed, to, trust, him, marlborough, s, weakness, during, anne, s, reign, lay, in, the, english, political, scene, his, determination, to, preserve, the, independence, of, the, queen, s, administration, from, the, control, of, the, party, faction, initially, enjoyed, full, support, but, once, royal, favour, turned, elsewhere, the, duke, like, his, key, ally, godolphin, found, himself, isolated, first, becoming, little, more, than, a, servant, of, the, whigs, then, a, victim, of, the, tories, nonetheless, he, has, been, consistently, ranked, as, one, of, the, greatest, military, commanders, of, the, modern, era, on, the, grand, strategic, level, marlborough, had, a, rare, grasp, of, the, broad, issues, involved, and, was, able, from, the, start, of, the, spanish, succession, war, to, see, the, conflict, in, its, entirety, he, was, one, of, the, few, influences, working, towards, genuine, unity, within, the, grand, alliance, but, the, extension, of, the, war, aims, to, include, the, replacement, of, philip, v, as, king, of, spain, was, a, fatal, mistake, marlborough, stands, accused, possibly, for, political, and, diplomatic, reasons, of, not, pressing, his, private, doubts, about, reinforcing, failure, spain, proved, a, continuous, drain, of, men, and, resources, and, ultimately, hampered, his, chances, of, complete, success, in, flanders, the, war, s, main, theatre, the, allies, did, come, close, to, a, complete, victory, on, several, occasions, but, the, increasingly, severe, conditions, imposed, upon, louis, xiv, forestalled, an, early, end, to, hostilities, although, the, duke, lost, his, political, influence, in, the, latter, stages, of, the, war, he, still, possessed, vast, prestige, abroad, yet, his, failure, to, communicate, his, innermost, convictions, to, his, allies, or, political, masters, means, he, must, bear, some, responsibility, for, the, continuance, of, the, war, beyond, its, logical, conclusion, as, a, commander, marlborough, preferred, battle, over, slow, moving, siege, warfare, aided, by, an, expert, staff, particularly, his, carefully, selected, aides, de, camp, such, as, cadogan, as, well, as, enjoying, a, close, personal, relationship, with, the, talented, imperial, commander, prince, eugene, marlborough, proved, far, sighted, often, far, ahead, of, his, contemporaries, in, his, conceptions, and, was, a, master, at, assessing, his, enemy, s, characteristics, in, battle, marlborough, was, more, likely, to, manoeuvre, than, his, opponents, and, was, better, at, maintaining, operational, tempo, at, critical, times, yet, the, duke, qualifies, more, as, a, great, practitioner, within, the, constraints, of, early, 18th, century, warfare, rather, than, as, a, great, innovator, who, radically, redefined, military, theory, nevertheless, his, predilection, for, fire, movement, and, coordinated, all, arms, attacks, lay, at, the, root, of, his, great, battlefield, successes, however, sicco, van, goslinga, one, of, the, dutch, deputies, who, worked, very, closely, with, marlborough, also, noted, several, flaws, although, generally, positive, about, marlborough, he, wrote, he, was, sometimes, indecisive, especially, on, the, eve, of, some, great, undertaking, shrank, from, difficulties, and, sometimes, allowed, himself, to, be, beaten, down, by, adversity, maybe, that, s, because, he, doesn, t, handle, fatigue, very, well, he, knows, little, about, military, discipline, and, gives, too, much, freedom, to, the, soldiers, causing, them, to, commit, horrible, excesses, it, has, often, been, said, by, british, historians, that, marlborough, was, also, a, good, administrator, and, that, his, attention, to, detail, meant, his, troops, rarely, went, short, of, supply, when, his, armies, arrived, at, their, destination, they, were, intact, and, in, a, fit, state, to, fight, however, they, often, fail, to, mention, marlborough, s, cooperation, with, dutch, officials, and, generals, who, were, more, than, him, concerned, with, the, logistics, of, the, army, despite, this, marlborough, s, concern, for, the, welfare, of, the, common, soldier, together, with, his, ability, to, inspire, trust, and, confidence, and, his, willingness, to, share, the, dangers, of, battle, often, earned, him, adulation, from, his, men, the, known, world, could, not, produce, a, man, of, more, humanity, observed, corporal, matthew, bishop, it, was, this, range, of, abilities, that, make, marlborough, outstanding, even, his, old, adversaries, recognised, the, duke, s, qualities, in, his, letters, on, the, study, of, history, 1752, bolingbroke, declared, i, take, with, pleasure, this, opportunity, of, doing, justice, to, that, great, man, as, the, greatest, general, and, as, the, greatest, minister, that, our, country, or, perhaps, any, other, has, produced, i, honour, his, success, was, made, possible, because, of, his, enormous, reserves, of, stamina, willpower, and, self, discipline, his, ability, to, hold, together, the, alliance, against, france, made, possible, by, his, victories, can, hardly, be, overestimated
