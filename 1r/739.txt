thales, of, miletus, e, l, i, z, thay, leez, greek, c, 626, 623, c, 548, 545, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, pre, socratic, philosopher, from, miletus, in, ionia, asia, minor, thales, was, one, of, the, seven, sages, founding, figures, of, ancient, greece, many, regard, him, as, the, first, philosopher, in, the, greek, tradition, breaking, from, the, prior, use, of, mythology, to, explain, the, world, and, instead, using, natural, philosophy, he, is, thus, otherwise, referred, to, as, the, first, to, have, engaged, in, mathematics, science, and, deductive, reasoning, the, first, philosophers, followed, him, in, explaining, all, of, nature, as, based, on, the, existence, of, a, single, ultimate, substance, thales, theorized, that, this, single, substance, was, water, thales, thought, the, earth, floated, on, water, in, mathematics, thales, is, the, namesake, of, thales, s, theorem, and, the, intercept, theorem, can, also, be, known, as, thales, s, theorem, thales, was, said, to, have, calculated, the, heights, of, the, pyramids, and, the, distance, of, ships, from, the, shore, in, science, thales, was, an, astronomer, who, reportedly, predicted, the, weather, and, a, solar, eclipse, the, discovery, of, the, position, of, the, constellation, ursa, major, is, also, attributed, to, thales, as, well, as, the, timings, of, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, he, was, also, an, engineer, known, for, having, diverted, the, halys, river, the, main, source, concerning, the, details, of, thales, s, life, and, career, is, the, doxographer, diogenes, la, rtius, in, his, third, century, ad, work, lives, and, opinions, of, the, eminent, philosophers, while, it, is, all, we, have, diogenes, wrote, some, eight, centuries, after, thales, s, death, and, his, sources, often, contained, unreliable, or, even, fabricated, information, it, is, known, thales, was, from, miletus, a, mercantile, city, settled, at, the, mouth, of, the, maeander, river, the, dates, of, thales, s, life, are, not, exactly, known, but, are, roughly, established, by, a, few, datable, events, mentioned, in, the, sources, according, to, the, historian, herodotus, writing, in, the, 5th, century, bc, thales, predicted, a, solar, eclipse, in, 585, bc, assuming, one, s, acme, occurred, at, the, age, of, 40, the, chronicle, of, apollodorus, of, athens, written, during, the, 2nd, century, bc, therefore, placed, thales, s, birth, about, the, year, 625, bc, while, the, probability, is, that, thales, was, as, greek, as, most, milesians, herodotus, described, thales, as, a, phoenician, by, remote, descent, diogenes, la, rtius, references, herodotus, duris, and, democritus, who, all, agree, that, thales, was, the, son, of, examyas, and, cleobulina, and, belonged, to, the, thelidae, who, are, phoenicians, and, amongst, the, noblest, descendants, of, cadmus, and, agenor, who, had, been, banished, from, phoenicia, and, that, thales, was, enrolled, as, a, citizen, in, miletus, along, with, neleus, however, friedrich, nietzsche, and, others, interpret, this, quote, as, meaning, only, that, his, ancestors, were, seafaring, cadmeians, from, boeotia, it, is, also, possible, that, he, was, of, mixed, ancestry, given, his, father, had, a, carian, name, and, his, mother, had, a, greek, name, diogenes, la, rtius, seems, to, also, reference, an, alternative, account, most, writers, however, represent, him, as, a, genuine, milesian, and, of, a, distinguished, family, encyclopedia, britannica, 1952, concluded, that, thales, was, most, likely, a, native, milesian, of, noble, birth, and, that, he, was, certainly, a, greek, diogenes, continues, by, delivering, more, conflicting, reports, one, that, thales, married, and, either, fathered, a, son, cybisthus, or, cybisthon, or, adopted, his, nephew, of, the, same, name, the, second, that, he, never, married, telling, his, mother, as, a, young, man, that, it, was, too, early, to, marry, and, as, an, older, man, that, it, was, too, late, plutarch, had, earlier, told, this, version, solon, visited, thales, and, asked, him, why, he, remained, single, thales, answered, that, he, did, not, like, the, idea, of, having, to, worry, about, children, nevertheless, several, years, later, anxious, for, family, he, adopted, his, nephew, cybisthus, the, culture, of, archaic, greece, was, heavily, influenced, by, those, of, the, levant, and, mesopotamia, it, is, said, thales, was, engaged, in, trade, and, visited, either, egypt, or, babylonia, however, there, is, no, strong, evidence, that, thales, ever, visited, countries, in, the, near, east, and, the, issue, is, disputed, among, scholars, visits, to, such, places, were, a, commonplace, attribution, to, various, philosophers, by, later, writers, especially, when, these, writers, tried, to, explain, the, origin, of, their, mathematical, knowledge, such, as, with, thales, or, pythagoras, or, eudoxus, several, ancient, authors, assume, that, thales, at, one, point, in, his, life, visited, egypt, where, he, learned, about, geometry, it, is, considered, possible, that, thales, visited, egypt, since, miletus, had, a, permanent, colony, there, namely, naucratis, it, is, also, said, thales, had, close, contacts, with, the, priests, of, thebes, who, instructed, him, or, even, that, he, instructed, them, in, geometry, it, is, also, possible, thales, knew, about, egypt, from, accounts, of, others, without, actually, visiting, it, aside, from, egypt, the, other, mathematically, advanced, ancient, civilization, before, the, greeks, was, babylonia, another, commonplace, attribution, of, travel, for, a, mathematically, minded, philosopher, at, least, one, ancient, historian, josephus, claims, thales, visited, babylonia, historians, roger, l, cooke, and, b, l, van, der, waerden, come, down, on, the, side, of, babylonian, mathematics, influencing, the, greeks, citing, the, use, of, e, g, the, sexagesimal, system, or, base, 60, cooke, notes, this, relation, however, is, controversial, others, historians, such, as, d, r, dicks, take, issue, with, the, idea, of, babylonian, influence, on, greek, mathematics, for, until, around, the, time, of, hipparchus, c, 190, 120, bc, their, sexagesimal, system, was, unknown, herodotus, wrote, the, greeks, learnt, the, gnomon, from, the, babylonians, thales, s, follower, anaximander, is, credited, with, introducing, the, gnomon, to, the, greeks, herodotus, also, wrote, that, the, practice, of, dividing, the, day, into, 12, parts, and, the, polos, came, to, the, greeks, from, the, babylonians, yet, this, too, is, disputed, for, example, by, historian, l, zhmud, who, points, out, the, gnomon, was, known, to, both, egyptians, and, babylonians, the, division, of, the, day, into, twelve, parts, and, by, analogy, the, year, was, known, to, the, egyptians, already, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, the, idea, of, the, polos, was, not, used, outside, of, greece, at, this, time, thales, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, seven, sages, of, greece, semi, legendary, wise, statesmen, and, founding, figures, of, ancient, greece, while, which, seven, one, chooses, may, change, the, seven, has, a, canonical, four, which, includes, thales, solon, of, athens, pittacus, of, mytilene, and, bias, of, priene, diogenes, la, rtius, tells, us, that, the, seven, sages, were, created, in, the, archonship, of, damasius, at, athens, about, 582, bc, and, that, thales, was, the, first, sage, the, sages, were, associated, with, the, delphic, maxims, a, quote, or, maxim, attributed, to, each, one, inscribed, on, the, temple, of, apollo, at, delphi, thales, has, arguably, the, most, famous, of, all, gnothi, seauton, or, know, thyself, according, to, the, 10th, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, the, suda, the, proverb, is, both, applied, to, those, whose, boasts, exceed, what, they, are, and, a, warning, to, pay, no, attention, to, the, opinion, of, the, multitude, diogenes, la, rtius, relates, several, stories, of, an, expensive, gold, tripod, or, bowl, that, is, to, go, to, the, most, wise, in, one, version, that, la, rtius, credits, to, callimachus, in, his, iambics, bathycles, of, arcadia, states, in, his, will, that, an, expensive, bowl, should, be, given, to, him, who, had, done, most, good, by, his, wisdom, so, it, was, given, to, thales, went, the, round, of, all, the, sages, and, came, back, to, thales, again, and, he, sent, it, to, apollo, at, didyma, with, this, dedication, thales, the, milesian, son, of, examyas, to, delphinian, apollo, after, twice, winning, the, prize, from, all, the, greeks, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, thales, gained, fame, as, a, counselor, when, he, advised, the, milesians, not, to, engage, in, a, symmachia, a, fighting, together, with, the, lydians, this, has, sometimes, been, interpreted, as, an, alliance, croesus, was, defeated, before, the, city, of, sardis, by, cyrus, the, great, who, subsequently, spared, miletus, because, it, had, taken, no, action, cyrus, was, so, impressed, by, croesus, wisdom, and, his, connection, with, the, sages, that, he, spared, him, and, took, his, advice, on, various, matters, the, ionian, cities, should, be, demoi, or, districts, he, counselled, them, to, establish, a, single, seat, of, government, and, pointed, out, teos, as, the, fittest, place, for, it, for, that, he, said, was, the, centre, of, ionia, their, other, cities, might, still, continue, to, enjoy, their, own, laws, just, as, if, they, were, independent, states, miletus, however, received, favorable, terms, from, cyrus, the, others, remained, in, an, ionian, league, of, twelve, cities, excluding, miletus, and, were, subjugated, by, the, persians, early, greeks, and, other, civilizations, before, them, often, invoked, idiosyncratic, explanations, of, natural, phenomena, with, reference, to, the, will, of, anthropomorphic, gods, and, heroes, instead, thales, aimed, to, explain, natural, phenomena, via, rational, hypotheses, that, referenced, natural, processes, themselves, logos, rather, than, mythos, many, most, notably, aristotle, regard, him, as, the, first, philosopher, in, the, greek, tradition, rather, than, theologoi, or, mythologoi, aristotle, referred, to, the, first, philosophers, as, physiologoi, or, natural, philosophers, and, thales, as, the, first, among, them, also, while, the, other, seven, sages, were, strictly, law, givers, and, statesmen, and, not, speculative, philosophers, plutarch, noted, it, would, seem, that, thales, was, the, only, wise, man, of, the, time, who, carried, his, speculations, beyond, the, realm, of, the, practical, thales, s, most, famous, idea, was, his, philosophical, and, cosmological, thesis, that, all, is, water, which, comes, down, to, us, through, a, passage, from, aristotle, s, metaphysics, in, the, work, aristotle, reported, thales, s, theory, that, the, arche, or, originating, principle, of, nature, was, a, single, material, substance, water, aristotle, then, proceeded, to, proffer, a, number, of, conjectures, based, on, his, own, observations, to, lend, some, credence, to, why, thales, may, have, advanced, this, idea, though, aristotle, did, not, hold, it, himself, while, aristotle, s, conjecture, on, why, thales, held, water, as, the, originating, principle, of, matter, is, his, own, thinking, his, statement, that, thales, held, it, as, water, is, generally, accepted, as, genuinely, originating, with, thales, writing, centuries, later, diogenes, la, rtius, also, states, that, thales, taught, water, constituted, stood, under, the, principle, of, all, things, according, to, aristotle, that, from, which, is, everything, that, exists, and, from, which, it, first, becomes, and, into, which, it, is, rendered, at, last, its, substance, remaining, under, it, but, transforming, in, qualities, that, they, say, is, the, element, and, principle, of, things, that, are, for, it, is, necessary, that, there, be, some, nature, either, one, or, more, than, one, from, which, become, the, other, things, of, the, object, being, saved, do, not, all, agree, as, to, the, number, and, the, nature, of, these, principles, thales, the, founder, of, this, type, of, philosophy, says, that, it, is, water, aristotle, further, adds, presumably, he, derived, this, assumption, from, seeing, that, the, nutriment, of, everything, is, moist, and, that, heat, itself, is, generated, from, moisture, and, depends, upon, it, for, its, existence, and, that, from, which, a, thing, is, generated, is, always, its, first, principle, he, derived, his, assumption, from, this, and, also, from, the, fact, that, the, seeds, of, everything, have, a, moist, nature, whereas, water, is, the, first, principle, of, the, nature, of, moist, things, the, 1870, book, dictionary, of, greek, and, roman, biography, and, mythology, noted, in, his, dogma, that, water, is, the, origin, of, things, that, is, that, it, is, that, out, of, which, every, thing, arises, and, into, which, every, thing, resolves, itself, thales, may, have, followed, orphic, cosmogonies, while, unlike, them, he, sought, to, establish, the, truth, of, the, assertion, hence, aristotle, immediately, after, he, has, called, him, the, originator, of, philosophy, brings, forward, the, reasons, which, thales, was, believed, to, have, adduced, in, confirmation, of, that, assertion, for, that, no, written, development, of, it, or, indeed, any, book, by, thales, was, extant, is, proved, by, the, expressions, which, aristotle, uses, when, he, brings, forward, the, doctrines, and, proofs, of, the, milesian, p, 1016, most, agree, that, thales, s, stamp, on, thought, is, the, unity, of, substance, not, merely, the, empirical, claim, that, all, is, water, but, the, deeper, philosophical, claim, that, all, is, one, for, example, friedrich, nietzsche, in, his, philosophy, in, the, tragic, age, of, the, greeks, wrote, greek, philosophy, seems, to, begin, with, an, absurd, notion, with, the, proposition, that, water, is, the, primal, origin, and, the, womb, of, all, things, is, it, really, necessary, for, us, to, take, serious, notice, of, this, proposition, it, is, and, for, three, reasons, first, because, it, tells, us, something, about, the, primal, origin, of, all, things, second, because, it, does, so, in, language, devoid, of, image, or, fable, and, finally, because, contained, in, it, if, only, embryonically, is, the, thought, all, things, are, one, megiston, topos, apanta, gar, chorei, the, greatest, is, space, for, it, holds, all, things, attributed, to, thales, thales, was, known, for, introducing, the, theoretical, and, practical, use, of, geometry, to, greece, and, has, been, described, as, the, first, person, in, the, western, world, to, apply, deductive, reasoning, to, geometry, making, him, the, west, s, first, mathematician, he, is, also, credited, with, the, west, s, oldest, definition, of, number, a, collection, of, units, following, the, egyptian, view, the, evidence, for, the, primacy, of, thales, comes, to, us, from, a, book, by, proclus, who, lived, a, thousand, years, afterward, but, is, believed, to, have, had, a, copy, of, eudemus, s, lost, book, history, of, geometry, 4th, century, bc, proclus, wrote, that, thales, was, the, first, to, visit, egypt, and, bring, the, egyptian, study, of, mathematics, to, greece, and, that, thales, himself, discovered, many, propositions, and, disclosed, the, underlying, principles, of, many, others, to, his, successors, in, some, case, his, method, being, more, general, in, others, more, empirical, in, addition, to, proclus, hieronymus, of, rhodes, 3rd, century, bc, also, cites, thales, as, the, first, greek, mathematician, proclus, attributes, to, thales, the, discovery, that, a, circle, is, bisected, by, its, diameter, that, the, base, angles, of, an, isosceles, triangle, are, equal, and, that, vertical, angles, are, equal, two, fundamental, theorems, of, elementary, geometry, are, customarily, called, thales, s, theorem, one, of, them, has, to, do, with, a, triangle, inscribed, in, a, circle, and, having, the, circle, s, diameter, as, one, side, the, other, also, called, the, intercept, theorem, is, about, an, angle, intercepted, by, two, parallel, lines, forming, a, pair, of, similar, triangles, modern, scholars, are, skeptical, that, anyone, in, thales, s, time, was, producing, mathematical, proofs, to, the, standard, of, later, greek, mathematics, though, not, enough, direct, evidence, remains, to, draw, firm, conclusions, while, thales, may, have, discovered, some, basic, geometric, relations, and, provided, some, justification, for, them, attribution, to, him, of, formal, proofs, is, now, thought, to, represent, speculative, rationalization, and, reconstruction, by, later, authors, rather, than, concrete, accomplishments, of, thales, himself, or, his, contemporaries, according, to, one, author, while, visiting, egypt, thales, observed, that, when, the, egyptians, drew, two, intersecting, lines, they, would, measure, the, vertical, angles, to, make, sure, that, they, were, equal, thales, concluded, that, one, could, prove, that, all, vertical, angles, are, equal, if, one, accepted, some, general, notions, such, as, all, straight, angles, are, equal, equals, added, to, equals, are, equal, and, equals, subtracted, from, equals, are, equal, pamphila, says, that, having, learnt, geometry, from, the, egyptians, thales, was, the, first, to, inscribe, in, a, circle, a, right, angled, triangle, whereupon, he, sacrificed, an, ox, this, is, sometimes, cited, as, history, s, first, mathematical, discovery, due, to, the, variations, among, testimonies, such, as, the, story, of, the, ox, sacrifice, being, accredited, to, pythagoras, upon, discovery, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, rather, than, thales, some, historians, such, as, d, r, dicks, question, whether, such, anecdotes, have, any, historical, worth, whatsoever, it, is, believed, the, babylonians, knew, the, theorem, for, special, cases, the, theorem, is, mentioned, and, proved, as, part, of, the, 31st, proposition, in, the, third, book, of, euclid, s, elements, dante, s, paradiso, refers, to, thales, s, theorem, in, the, course, of, a, speech, the, story, is, told, in, diogenes, la, rtius, pliny, the, elder, and, plutarch, sourced, from, hieronymus, of, rhodes, that, when, thales, visited, egypt, he, measured, the, height, of, the, pyramids, by, their, shadows, at, the, moment, when, his, own, shadow, was, equal, to, his, height, according, to, plutarch, it, pleased, the, pharoah, amasis, more, practically, thales, was, said, to, have, the, ability, to, measure, the, distances, of, ships, at, sea, these, stories, indicate, familiarity, with, the, intercept, theorem, and, for, this, reason, the, 26th, proposition, in, the, first, book, of, euclid, s, elements, was, attributed, to, thales, they, also, indicate, that, he, was, familiar, with, the, egyptian, seked, or, seqed, the, ratio, of, the, run, to, the, rise, of, a, slope, cotangent, according, to, kirk, raven, all, you, need, for, this, feat, is, three, straight, sticks, pinned, at, one, end, and, knowledge, of, your, altitude, one, stick, goes, vertically, into, the, ground, a, second, is, made, level, with, the, third, you, sight, the, ship, and, calculate, the, seked, from, the, height, of, the, stick, and, its, distance, from, the, point, of, insertion, to, the, line, of, sight, thales, was, also, a, noted, astronomer, acknowledged, in, antiquity, for, describing, the, position, of, ursa, minor, and, he, thought, the, constellation, might, be, useful, as, a, guide, for, navigation, at, sea, he, calculated, the, duration, of, the, year, and, the, timings, of, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, he, is, additionally, attributed, with, calculating, the, position, of, the, pleiades, plutarch, indicates, that, in, his, day, c, ad, 100, there, was, an, extant, work, the, astronomy, composed, in, verse, and, attributed, to, thales, while, some, say, he, left, no, writings, others, say, that, he, wrote, on, the, solstice, and, on, the, equinox, the, nautical, star, guide, has, also, been, attributed, to, him, but, this, was, disputed, even, in, ancient, times, no, writing, attributed, to, him, has, survived, lobon, of, argus, asserted, that, the, writings, of, thales, amounted, to, two, hundred, lines, thales, thought, the, earth, must, be, a, flat, disk, or, mound, of, land, and, dirt, which, is, floating, in, an, expanse, of, water, heraclitus, homericus, states, that, thales, drew, his, conclusion, from, seeing, moist, substance, turn, into, air, slime, and, earth, it, seems, likely, that, thales, viewed, the, land, as, coming, from, the, water, on, which, it, floated, and, the, oceans, that, surround, it, perhaps, inspired, by, observing, silt, deposits, he, thought, the, stars, were, balls, of, dirt, on, fire, he, seemed, to, correctly, gather, that, the, moon, reflects, the, sun, s, light, a, crater, on, the, moon, is, named, in, his, honor, rather, than, assuming, that, earthquakes, were, the, result, of, supernatural, whims, thales, explained, them, by, theorizing, that, the, earth, floats, on, water, and, that, earthquakes, occur, when, the, earth, is, rocked, by, waves, he, is, attributed, with, the, first, observation, of, the, hyades, supposed, by, the, ancients, to, indicate, the, approach, of, rain, when, they, rose, with, the, sun, according, to, seneca, thales, explained, the, flooding, of, the, nile, as, due, to, the, river, being, beaten, back, by, the, etesian, wind, a, story, with, different, versions, recounts, how, thales, achieved, riches, from, an, olive, harvest, by, prediction, of, the, weather, in, one, version, he, bought, all, the, olive, presses, in, miletus, after, predicting, the, weather, and, a, good, harvest, for, a, particular, year, another, version, of, the, story, has, aristotle, explain, that, thales, had, reserved, presses, in, advance, at, a, discount, and, could, rent, them, out, at, a, high, price, when, demand, peaked, following, his, prediction, of, a, particularly, good, harvest, this, first, version, of, the, story, would, constitute, the, first, historically, known, creation, and, use, of, futures, whereas, the, second, version, would, be, the, first, historically, known, creation, and, use, of, options, aristotle, explains, that, thales, s, objective, in, doing, this, was, not, to, enrich, himself, but, to, prove, to, his, fellow, milesians, that, philosophy, could, be, useful, contrary, to, what, they, thought, or, alternatively, thales, had, made, his, foray, into, enterprise, because, of, a, personal, challenge, put, to, him, by, an, individual, who, had, asked, why, if, thales, was, an, intelligent, famous, philosopher, he, had, yet, to, attain, wealth, as, mentioned, above, according, to, herodotus, thales, predicted, a, solar, eclipse, which, occurred, during, a, battle, between, the, lydians, and, the, medes, among, eclipses, of, the, era, only, the, eclipse, of, 28, may, 585, bc, reached, totality, in, anatolia, where, the, war, took, place, american, writer, isaac, asimov, described, this, battle, as, the, earliest, historical, event, whose, date, is, known, with, precision, to, the, day, and, called, the, prediction, the, birth, of, science, as, well, as, first, mathematician, and, first, philosopher, thales, is, often, given, the, label, of, the, first, western, scientist, and, the, father, of, science, but, some, contemporary, scholars, reject, this, interpretation, herodotus, writes, that, in, the, sixth, year, of, the, war, the, lydians, under, king, alyattes, and, the, medes, under, cyaxares, were, engaged, in, an, indecisive, battle, when, suddenly, day, turned, into, night, leading, to, both, parties, halting, the, fighting, and, negotiating, a, peace, agreement, herodotus, also, mentions, that, the, loss, of, daylight, had, been, predicted, by, thales, he, does, not, however, mention, the, location, of, the, battle, afterwards, on, the, refusal, of, alyattes, to, give, up, his, suppliants, when, cyaxares, sent, to, demand, them, of, him, war, broke, out, between, the, lydians, and, the, medes, and, continued, for, five, years, with, various, success, in, the, course, of, it, the, medes, gained, many, victories, over, the, lydians, and, the, lydians, also, gained, many, victories, over, the, medes, among, their, other, battles, there, was, one, night, engagement, as, however, the, balance, had, not, inclined, in, favour, of, either, nation, another, combat, took, place, in, the, sixth, year, in, the, course, of, which, just, as, the, battle, was, growing, warm, day, was, on, a, sudden, changed, into, night, this, event, had, been, foretold, by, thales, the, milesian, who, forewarned, the, ionians, of, it, fixing, for, it, the, very, year, in, which, it, actually, took, place, the, medes, and, lydians, when, they, observed, the, change, ceased, fighting, and, were, alike, anxious, to, have, terms, of, peace, agreed, on, however, based, on, the, list, of, median, kings, and, the, duration, of, their, reign, reported, elsewhere, by, herodotus, cyaxares, died, 10, years, before, the, eclipse, d, r, dicks, joins, other, historians, f, martini, j, l, e, dreyer, o, neugebauer, in, rejecting, the, historicity, of, the, eclipse, story, dicks, links, the, story, of, thales, discovering, the, cause, for, a, solar, eclipse, with, herodotus, claim, that, thales, discovered, the, cycle, of, the, sun, with, relation, to, the, solstices, and, concludes, he, could, not, possibly, have, possessed, this, knowledge, which, neither, the, egyptians, nor, the, babylonians, nor, his, immediate, successors, possessed, plato, diogenes, laertius, and, hippolytus, all, relay, the, story, that, thales, was, so, intent, upon, watching, the, stars, that, he, failed, to, watch, where, he, was, walking, and, fell, into, a, well, thales, was, studying, the, stars, and, gazing, into, the, sky, when, he, fell, into, a, well, and, a, jolly, and, witty, thracian, servant, girl, made, fun, of, him, saying, that, he, was, crazy, to, know, about, what, was, up, in, the, heavens, while, he, could, not, see, what, was, in, front, of, him, beneath, his, feet, in, addition, to, astronomy, thales, involved, himself, in, other, practical, applications, of, mathematics, including, engineering, another, story, by, herodotus, is, that, croesus, sent, his, army, to, the, persian, territory, he, was, stopped, by, the, river, halys, then, unbridged, thales, then, got, the, army, across, the, river, by, digging, a, diversion, upstream, so, as, to, reduce, the, flow, making, it, possible, to, cross, the, river, while, herodotus, reported, that, most, of, his, fellow, greeks, believe, that, thales, did, divert, the, river, halys, to, assist, king, croesus, military, endeavors, he, himself, finds, it, doubtful, plato, praises, thales, along, with, anacharsis, who, is, credited, as, the, originator, of, the, potter, s, wheel, and, the, anchor, according, to, aristotle, thales, thought, all, things, are, full, of, gods, i, e, lodestones, had, souls, because, iron, is, attracted, to, them, by, the, force, of, magnetism, the, same, applied, to, amber, for, its, capacity, to, generate, static, electricity, the, reasoning, for, such, hylozoism, or, organicism, seems, to, be, if, something, moved, then, it, was, alive, and, if, it, was, alive, then, it, must, have, a, soul, as, well, as, gods, seen, in, the, movement, caused, by, what, came, to, be, known, as, magnetism, and, electricity, it, seems, thales, also, had, a, supreme, god, which, structured, the, universe, thales, says, cicero, assures, that, water, is, the, principle, of, all, things, and, that, god, is, that, mind, which, shaped, and, created, all, things, from, water, according, to, henry, fielding, 1775, diogenes, la, rtius, 1, 35, affirmed, that, thales, posed, the, independent, pre, existence, of, god, from, all, eternity, stating, that, god, was, the, oldest, of, all, beings, for, he, existed, without, a, previous, cause, even, in, the, way, of, generation, that, the, world, was, the, most, beautiful, of, all, things, for, it, was, created, by, god, nicholas, molinari, has, recently, argued, that, thales, was, influenced, by, the, archaic, water, deity, acheloios, who, was, equated, with, water, and, worshipped, in, miletus, during, thales, s, life, for, evidence, he, points, to, the, fact, that, hydor, meant, specifically, fresh, water, and, also, that, acheloios, was, seen, as, a, shape, shifter, in, myth, and, art, so, able, to, become, anything, he, also, points, out, that, the, rivers, of, the, world, were, seen, as, the, sinews, of, acheloios, in, antiquity, and, this, multiplicity, of, deities, is, reflected, in, thales, s, idea, that, all, things, are, full, of, gods, diogenes, la, rtius, quotes, apollodorus, as, saying, that, thales, died, at, the, age, of, 78, during, the, 58th, olympiad, 548, 545, bc, and, attributes, his, death, to, heat, stroke, and, thirst, while, watching, the, games, as, the, first, philosopher, and, mathematician, thales, had, a, profound, influence, on, other, greek, thinkers, and, therefore, on, western, history, however, due, to, the, scarcity, of, sources, concerning, thales, and, the, discrepancies, between, the, accounts, given, in, the, sources, that, have, survived, there, is, a, scholarly, debate, over, the, extent, of, the, influence, of, thales, had, and, on, which, of, the, greek, philosophers, and, mathematicians, that, came, after, him, the, first, three, philosophers, in, the, western, tradition, were, all, cosmologists, from, miletus, and, thales, was, the, very, first, followed, by, anaximander, who, was, followed, in, turn, by, anaximenes, they, have, been, dubbed, the, milesian, school, according, to, the, suda, thales, had, been, the, teacher, and, kinsman, of, anaximander, rather, than, water, anaximander, held, all, was, made, of, apeiron, or, the, unlimited, while, anaximenes, the, successor, of, anaximander, perhaps, more, like, thales, with, water, held, that, everything, was, composed, of, air, john, burnet, 1892, noted, lastly, we, have, one, admitted, instance, of, a, philosophic, guild, that, of, the, pythagoreans, and, it, will, be, found, that, the, hypothesis, if, it, is, to, be, called, by, that, name, of, a, regular, organisation, of, scientific, activity, will, alone, explain, all, the, facts, the, development, of, doctrine, in, the, hands, of, thales, anaximander, and, anaximenes, for, instance, can, only, be, understood, as, the, elaboration, of, a, single, idea, in, a, school, with, a, continuous, tradition, as, two, of, the, first, greek, mathematicians, thales, is, also, considered, an, influence, on, pythagoras, according, to, iamblichus, pythagoras, had, benefited, by, the, instruction, of, thales, in, many, respects, but, his, greatest, lesson, had, been, to, learn, the, value, of, saving, time, early, sources, report, that, pythagoras, in, this, story, a, pupil, of, anaximander, visited, thales, as, a, young, man, and, that, thales, advised, him, to, travel, to, egypt, to, further, his, philosophical, and, mathematical, studies, thales, was, also, considered, the, teacher, of, the, astronomer, mandrolytus, of, priene, it, is, possible, he, was, also, the, teacher, of, cleostratus, of, tenedos
