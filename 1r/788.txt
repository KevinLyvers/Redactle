eusebius, of, caesarea, c, ad, 260, 265, 30, may, ad, 339, also, known, as, eusebius, pamphilius, was, a, greek, syro, palestinian, historian, of, christianity, exegete, and, christian, polemicist, in, about, ad, 314, he, became, the, bishop, of, caesarea, maritima, in, the, roman, province, of, syria, palaestina, together, with, pamphilus, eusebius, was, a, scholar, of, the, biblical, canon, and, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, learned, christians, during, late, antiquity, he, wrote, the, demonstrations, of, the, gospel, preparations, for, the, gospel, and, on, discrepancies, between, the, gospels, studies, of, the, biblical, text, his, work, onomasticon, is, an, early, geographical, lexicon, of, places, in, the, holy, land, mentioned, in, the, bible, as, father, of, church, history, not, to, be, confused, with, the, title, of, church, father, he, produced, the, ecclesiastical, history, on, the, life, of, pamphilus, the, chronicle, and, on, the, martyrs, he, also, produced, a, biographical, work, on, constantine, the, great, the, first, christian, roman, emperor, who, was, augustus, between, ad, 306, and, ad, 337, little, is, known, about, the, life, of, eusebius, his, successor, at, the, see, of, caesarea, acacius, wrote, a, life, of, eusebius, a, work, that, has, since, been, lost, eusebius, own, surviving, works, probably, only, represent, a, small, portion, of, his, total, output, beyond, notices, in, his, extant, writings, the, major, sources, are, the, 5th, century, ecclesiastical, historians, socrates, sozomen, and, theodoret, and, the, 4th, century, christian, author, jerome, there, are, assorted, notices, of, his, activities, in, the, writings, of, his, contemporaries, athanasius, arius, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, alexander, of, alexandria, eusebius, pupil, eusebius, of, emesa, provides, some, incidental, information, most, scholars, date, the, birth, of, eusebius, to, some, point, between, ad, 260, and, 265, he, was, most, likely, born, in, or, around, caesarea, maritima, nothing, is, known, about, his, parents, he, was, baptized, and, instructed, in, the, city, and, lived, in, syria, palaestina, in, 296, when, diocletian, s, army, passed, through, the, region, in, the, life, of, constantine, eusebius, recalls, seeing, constantine, traveling, with, the, army, eusebius, was, made, presbyter, by, agapius, of, caesarea, some, like, theologian, and, ecclesiastical, historian, john, henry, newman, understand, eusebius, statement, that, he, had, heard, dorotheus, of, tyre, expound, the, scriptures, wisely, in, the, church, to, indicate, that, eusebius, was, dorotheus, pupil, while, the, priest, was, resident, in, antioch, others, like, the, scholar, d, s, wallace, hadrill, deem, the, phrase, too, ambiguous, to, support, the, contention, through, the, activities, of, the, theologian, origen, 185, 6, 254, and, the, school, of, his, follower, pamphilus, later, 3rd, century, 309, caesarea, became, a, center, of, christian, learning, origen, was, largely, responsible, for, the, collection, of, usage, information, or, which, churches, were, using, which, gospels, regarding, the, texts, which, became, the, new, testament, the, information, used, to, create, the, late, fourth, century, easter, letter, which, declared, accepted, christian, writings, was, probably, based, on, the, ecclesiastical, history, of, eusebius, of, caesarea, wherein, he, uses, the, information, passed, on, to, him, by, origen, to, create, both, his, list, at, he, 3, 25, and, origen, s, list, at, he, 6, 25, eusebius, got, his, information, about, what, texts, were, accepted, by, the, third, century, churches, throughout, the, known, world, a, great, deal, of, which, origen, knew, of, firsthand, from, his, extensive, travels, from, the, library, and, writings, of, origen, on, his, deathbed, origen, had, made, a, bequest, of, his, private, library, to, the, christian, community, in, the, city, together, with, the, books, of, his, patron, ambrosius, origen, s, library, including, the, original, manuscripts, of, his, works, formed, the, core, of, the, collection, that, pamphilus, established, pamphilus, also, managed, a, school, that, was, similar, to, or, perhaps, a, re, establishment, of, that, of, origen, he, was, compared, to, demetrius, of, phalerum, as, well, as, to, another, evidently, learn, d, scholar, by, the, name, of, pisistratus, for, pamphilus, had, gathered, bibles, from, all, parts, of, the, world, like, his, model, origen, pamphilus, maintained, close, contact, with, his, students, eusebius, in, his, history, of, the, persecutions, alludes, to, the, fact, that, many, of, the, caesarean, martyrs, lived, together, presumably, under, pamphilus, soon, after, pamphilus, settled, in, caesarea, c, 280s, he, began, teaching, eusebius, who, was, then, somewhere, between, twenty, and, twenty, five, because, of, his, close, relationship, with, his, schoolmaster, eusebius, was, sometimes, called, eusebius, pamphili, eusebius, son, of, pamphilus, the, name, may, also, indicate, that, eusebius, was, made, pamphilus, heir, pamphilus, gave, eusebius, a, strong, admiration, for, the, thought, of, origen, neither, pamphilus, nor, eusebius, knew, origen, personally, pamphilus, probably, picked, up, origenist, ideas, during, his, studies, under, pierius, nicknamed, origen, junior, in, alexandria, eusebius, preparation, for, the, gospel, bears, witness, to, the, literary, tastes, of, origen, eusebius, quotes, no, comedy, tragedy, or, lyric, poetry, but, makes, reference, to, all, the, works, of, plato, and, to, an, extensive, range, of, later, philosophic, works, largely, from, middle, platonists, from, philo, to, the, late, 2nd, century, whatever, its, secular, contents, the, primary, aim, of, origen, and, pamphilus, school, was, to, promote, sacred, learning, the, library, s, biblical, and, theological, contents, were, more, impressive, origen, s, hexapla, and, tetrapla, a, copy, of, the, original, aramaic, version, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, and, many, of, origen, s, own, writings, marginal, comments, in, extant, manuscripts, note, that, pamphilus, and, his, friends, and, pupils, including, eusebius, corrected, and, revised, much, of, the, biblical, text, in, their, library, their, efforts, made, the, hexaplaric, septuagint, text, increasingly, popular, in, syria, and, palestine, soon, after, joining, pamphilus, school, eusebius, started, helping, his, master, expand, the, library, s, collections, and, broaden, access, to, its, resources, at, about, this, time, eusebius, compiled, a, collection, of, ancient, martyrdoms, presumably, for, use, as, a, general, reference, tool, in, the, 290s, eusebius, began, work, on, his, most, important, work, the, ecclesiastical, history, a, narrative, history, of, the, church, and, christian, community, from, the, apostolic, age, to, eusebius, own, time, at, about, the, same, time, he, worked, on, his, chronicle, a, universal, calendar, of, events, from, the, creation, to, again, eusebius, own, time, he, completed, the, first, editions, of, the, ecclesiastical, history, and, chronicle, before, 300, eusebius, succeeded, agapius, as, bishop, of, caesarea, soon, after, 313, and, was, called, on, by, arius, who, had, been, excommunicated, by, his, bishop, alexander, of, alexandria, an, episcopal, council, in, caesarea, pronounced, arius, blameless, eusebius, enjoyed, the, favor, of, the, emperor, constantine, because, of, this, he, was, called, upon, to, present, the, creed, of, his, own, church, to, the, 318, attendees, of, the, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, however, the, anti, arian, creed, from, palestine, prevailed, becoming, the, basis, for, the, nicene, creed, the, theological, views, of, arius, that, taught, the, subordination, of, the, son, to, the, father, continued, to, be, controversial, eustathius, of, antioch, strongly, opposed, the, growing, influence, of, origen, s, theology, as, the, root, of, arianism, eusebius, an, admirer, of, origen, was, reproached, by, eustathius, for, deviating, from, the, nicene, faith, eusebius, prevailed, and, eustathius, was, deposed, at, a, synod, in, antioch, however, athanasius, of, alexandria, became, a, more, powerful, opponent, and, in, 334, he, was, summoned, before, a, synod, in, caesarea, which, he, refused, to, attend, in, the, following, year, he, was, again, summoned, before, a, synod, in, tyre, at, which, eusebius, of, caesarea, presided, athanasius, foreseeing, the, result, went, to, constantinople, to, bring, his, cause, before, the, emperor, constantine, called, the, bishops, to, his, court, among, them, eusebius, athanasius, was, condemned, and, exiled, at, the, end, of, 335, eusebius, remained, in, the, emperor, s, favour, throughout, this, time, and, more, than, once, was, exonerated, with, the, explicit, approval, of, the, emperor, constantine, after, the, emperor, s, death, c, 337, eusebius, wrote, the, life, of, constantine, an, important, historical, work, because, of, eyewitness, accounts, and, the, use, of, primary, sources, of, the, extensive, literary, activity, of, eusebius, a, relatively, large, portion, has, been, preserved, although, posterity, suspected, him, of, arianism, eusebius, had, made, himself, indispensable, by, his, method, of, authorship, his, comprehensive, and, careful, excerpts, from, original, sources, saved, his, successors, the, painstaking, labor, of, original, research, hence, much, has, been, preserved, quoted, by, eusebius, which, otherwise, would, have, been, lost, the, literary, productions, of, eusebius, reflect, on, the, whole, the, course, of, his, life, at, first, he, occupied, himself, with, works, on, biblical, criticism, under, the, influence, of, pamphilus, and, probably, of, dorotheus, of, tyre, of, the, school, of, antioch, afterward, the, persecutions, under, diocletian, and, galerius, directed, his, attention, to, the, martyrs, of, his, own, time, and, the, past, and, this, led, him, to, the, history, of, the, whole, church, and, finally, to, the, history, of, the, world, which, to, him, was, only, a, preparation, for, ecclesiastical, history, then, followed, the, time, of, the, arian, controversies, and, dogmatic, questions, came, into, the, foreground, christianity, at, last, found, recognition, by, the, state, and, this, brought, new, problems, apologies, of, a, different, sort, had, to, be, prepared, lastly, eusebius, wrote, eulogies, in, praise, of, constantine, to, all, this, activity, must, be, added, numerous, writings, of, a, miscellaneous, nature, addresses, letters, and, the, like, and, exegetical, works, that, extended, over, the, whole, of, his, life, and, that, include, both, commentaries, and, an, important, treatise, on, the, location, of, biblical, place, names, and, the, distances, between, these, cities, pamphilus, and, eusebius, occupied, themselves, with, the, textual, criticism, of, the, septuagint, text, of, the, old, testament, and, especially, of, the, new, testament, an, edition, of, the, septuagint, seems, to, have, been, already, prepared, by, origen, which, according, to, jerome, was, revised, and, circulated, by, eusebius, and, pamphilus, for, an, easier, survey, of, the, material, of, the, four, evangelists, eusebius, divided, his, edition, of, the, new, testament, into, paragraphs, and, provided, it, with, a, synoptical, table, so, that, it, might, be, easier, to, find, the, pericopes, that, belong, together, these, canon, tables, or, eusebian, canons, remained, in, use, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, illuminated, manuscript, versions, are, important, for, the, study, of, early, medieval, art, as, they, are, the, most, elaborately, decorated, pages, of, many, gospel, books, eusebius, detailed, in, epistula, ad, carpianum, how, to, use, his, canons, the, chronicle, pantodape, historia, is, divided, into, two, parts, the, first, part, the, chronography, chronographia, gives, an, epitome, of, universal, history, from, the, sources, arranged, according, to, nations, the, second, part, the, canons, chronikoi, kanones, furnishes, a, synchronism, of, the, historical, material, in, parallel, columns, the, equivalent, of, a, parallel, timeline, the, work, as, a, whole, has, been, lost, in, the, original, greek, but, it, may, be, reconstructed, from, later, chronographists, of, the, byzantine, school, who, made, excerpts, from, the, work, especially, george, syncellus, the, tables, of, the, second, part, have, been, completely, preserved, in, a, latin, translation, by, jerome, and, both, parts, are, still, extant, in, an, armenian, translation, the, loss, of, the, greek, originals, has, given, the, armenian, translation, a, special, importance, thus, the, first, part, of, eusebius, chronicle, of, which, only, a, few, fragments, exist, in, greek, has, been, preserved, entirely, in, armenian, though, with, lacunae, the, chronicle, as, preserved, extends, to, the, year, 325, in, his, church, history, or, ecclesiastical, history, eusebius, wrote, the, first, surviving, history, of, the, christian, church, as, a, chronologically, ordered, account, based, on, earlier, sources, complete, from, the, period, of, the, apostles, to, his, own, epoch, the, time, scheme, correlated, the, history, with, the, reigns, of, the, roman, emperors, and, the, scope, was, broad, included, were, the, bishops, and, other, teachers, of, the, church, christian, relations, with, the, jews, and, those, deemed, heretical, and, the, christian, martyrs, through, 324, although, its, accuracy, and, biases, have, been, questioned, it, remains, an, important, source, on, the, early, church, due, to, eusebius, s, access, to, materials, now, lost, eusebius, life, of, constantine, vita, constantini, is, a, eulogy, or, panegyric, and, therefore, its, style, and, selection, of, facts, are, affected, by, its, purpose, rendering, it, inadequate, as, a, continuation, of, the, church, history, as, the, historian, socrates, scholasticus, said, at, the, opening, of, his, history, which, was, designed, as, a, continuation, of, eusebius, also, in, writing, the, life, of, constantine, this, same, author, has, but, slightly, treated, of, matters, regarding, arius, being, more, intent, on, the, rhetorical, finish, of, his, composition, and, the, praises, of, the, emperor, than, on, an, accurate, statement, of, facts, the, work, was, unfinished, at, eusebius, death, some, scholars, have, questioned, the, eusebian, authorship, of, this, work, writing, after, constantine, had, died, eusebius, claimed, that, the, emperor, himself, had, recounted, to, him, that, some, time, between, the, death, of, his, father, the, augustus, constantius, and, his, final, battle, against, his, rival, maxentius, as, augustus, in, the, west, constantine, experienced, a, vision, in, which, he, and, his, soldiers, beheld, a, christian, symbol, a, cross, shaped, trophy, formed, from, light, above, the, sun, at, midday, attached, to, the, symbol, was, the, phrase, by, this, conquer, en, to, t, i, n, ka, a, phrase, often, rendered, into, latin, as, in, hoc, signo, vinces, in, a, dream, that, night, the, christ, of, god, appeared, to, him, with, the, sign, which, had, appeared, in, the, sky, and, urged, him, to, make, himself, a, copy, of, the, sign, which, had, appeared, in, the, sky, and, to, use, this, as, a, protection, against, the, attacks, of, the, enemy, eusebius, relates, that, this, happened, on, a, campaign, he, was, conducting, somewhere, it, is, unclear, from, eusebius, s, description, whether, the, shields, were, marked, with, a, christian, cross, or, with, a, chi, rho, a, staurogram, or, another, similar, symbol, the, latin, text, de, mortibus, persecutorum, contains, an, early, account, of, the, 28, october, 312, battle, of, the, milvian, bridge, written, by, lactantius, probably, in, 313, the, year, following, the, battle, lactantius, does, not, mention, a, vision, in, the, sky, but, describes, a, revelatory, dream, on, the, eve, of, battle, eusebius, s, work, of, that, time, his, church, history, also, makes, no, mention, of, the, vision, the, arch, of, constantine, constructed, in, ad, 315, neither, depicts, a, vision, nor, any, christian, insignia, in, its, depiction, of, the, battle, in, his, posthumous, biography, of, constantine, eusebius, agrees, with, lactantius, that, constantine, received, instructions, in, a, dream, to, apply, a, christian, symbol, as, a, device, to, his, soldiers, shields, but, unlike, lactantius, and, subsequent, christian, tradition, eusebius, does, not, date, the, events, to, october, 312, and, does, not, connect, constantine, s, vision, and, dream, vision, with, the, battle, of, the, milvian, bridge, before, he, compiled, his, church, history, eusebius, edited, a, collection, of, martyrdoms, of, the, earlier, period, and, a, biography, of, pamphilus, the, martyrology, has, not, survived, as, a, whole, but, it, has, been, preserved, almost, completely, in, parts, it, contained, of, the, life, of, pamphilus, only, a, fragment, survives, a, work, on, the, martyrs, of, palestine, in, the, time, of, diocletian, was, composed, after, 311, numerous, fragments, are, scattered, in, legendaries, which, have, yet, to, be, collected, the, life, of, constantine, was, compiled, after, the, death, of, the, emperor, and, the, election, of, his, sons, as, augusti, 337, it, is, more, a, rhetorical, eulogy, on, the, emperor, than, a, history, but, is, of, great, value, on, account, of, numerous, documents, incorporated, into, it, to, the, class, of, apologetic, and, dogmatic, works, belong, a, number, of, writings, belonging, in, this, category, have, been, entirely, lost, all, of, the, exegetical, works, of, eusebius, have, suffered, damage, in, transmission, the, majority, of, them, are, known, to, us, only, from, long, portions, quoted, in, byzantine, catena, commentaries, however, these, portions, are, very, extensive, extant, are, eusebius, also, wrote, a, work, quaestiones, ad, stephanum, et, marinum, on, the, differences, of, the, gospels, including, solutions, this, was, written, for, the, purpose, of, harmonizing, the, contradictions, in, the, reports, of, the, different, evangelists, this, work, was, recently, 2011, translated, into, the, english, language, by, david, j, miller, and, adam, c, mccollum, and, was, published, under, the, name, eusebius, of, caesarea, gospel, problems, and, solutions, the, original, work, was, also, translated, into, syriac, and, lengthy, quotations, exist, in, a, catena, in, that, language, and, also, in, arabic, catenas, eusebius, also, wrote, treatises, on, the, biblical, past, these, three, treatises, have, been, lost, they, were, the, addresses, and, sermons, of, eusebius, are, mostly, lost, but, some, have, been, preserved, e, g, a, sermon, on, the, consecration, of, the, church, in, tyre, and, an, address, on, the, thirtieth, anniversary, of, the, reign, of, constantine, 336, most, of, eusebius, letters, are, lost, his, letters, to, carpianus, and, flacillus, exist, complete, fragments, of, a, letter, to, the, empress, constantia, also, exists, eusebius, is, fairly, unusual, in, his, preterist, or, fulfilled, eschatological, view, saying, the, holy, scriptures, foretell, that, there, will, be, unmistakable, signs, of, the, coming, of, christ, now, there, were, among, the, hebrews, three, outstanding, offices, of, dignity, which, made, the, nation, famous, firstly, the, kingship, secondly, that, of, prophet, and, lastly, the, high, priesthood, the, prophecies, said, that, the, abolition, and, complete, destruction, of, all, these, three, together, would, be, the, sign, of, the, presence, of, the, christ, and, that, the, proofs, that, the, times, had, come, would, lie, in, the, ceasing, of, the, mosaic, worship, the, desolation, of, jerusalem, and, its, temple, and, the, subjection, of, the, whole, jewish, race, to, its, enemies, the, holy, oracles, foretold, that, all, these, changes, which, had, not, been, made, in, the, days, of, the, prophets, of, old, would, take, place, at, the, coming, of, the, christ, which, i, will, presently, shew, to, have, been, fulfilled, as, never, before, in, accordance, with, the, predictions, demonstratio, evangelica, viii, from, a, dogmatic, point, of, view, eusebius, is, related, in, his, views, to, origen, like, origen, he, started, from, the, fundamental, thought, of, the, absolute, sovereignty, monarchia, of, god, god, is, the, cause, of, all, beings, but, he, is, not, merely, a, cause, in, him, everything, good, is, included, from, him, all, life, originates, and, he, is, the, source, of, all, virtue, god, sent, christ, into, the, world, that, it, may, partake, of, the, blessings, included, in, the, essence, of, god, eusebius, expressly, distinguishes, the, son, as, distinct, from, father, as, a, ray, is, also, distinct, from, its, source, the, sun, eusebius, held, that, men, were, sinners, by, their, own, free, choice, and, not, by, the, necessity, of, their, natures, eusebius, said, the, creator, of, all, things, has, impressed, a, natural, law, upon, the, soul, of, every, man, as, an, assistant, and, ally, in, his, conduct, pointing, out, to, him, the, right, way, by, this, law, but, by, the, free, liberty, with, which, he, is, endowed, making, the, choice, of, what, is, best, worthy, of, praise, and, acceptance, he, has, acted, rightly, not, by, force, but, from, his, own, free, will, when, he, had, it, in, his, power, to, act, otherwise, as, again, making, him, who, chooses, what, is, worst, deserving, of, blame, and, punishment, because, he, has, by, his, own, motion, neglected, the, natural, law, and, becoming, the, origin, and, fountain, of, wickedness, and, misusing, himself, not, from, any, extraneous, necessity, but, from, free, will, and, judgment, the, fault, is, in, him, who, chooses, not, in, god, for, god, has, not, made, nature, or, the, substance, of, the, soul, bad, for, he, who, is, good, can, make, nothing, but, what, is, good, everything, is, good, which, is, according, to, nature, every, rational, soul, has, naturally, a, good, free, will, formed, for, the, choice, of, what, is, good, but, when, a, man, acts, wrongly, nature, is, not, to, be, blamed, for, what, is, wrong, takes, place, not, according, to, nature, but, contrary, to, nature, it, being, the, work, of, choice, and, not, of, nature, a, letter, eusebius, is, supposed, to, have, written, to, constantine, s, daughter, constantina, refusing, to, fulfill, her, request, for, images, of, christ, was, quoted, in, the, decrees, now, lost, of, the, iconoclast, council, of, hieria, in, 754, and, later, quoted, in, part, in, the, rebuttal, of, the, hieria, decrees, in, the, second, council, of, nicaea, of, 787, now, the, only, source, from, which, some, of, the, text, is, known, the, authenticity, or, authorship, of, the, letter, remains, uncertain, in, the, june, 2002, issue, of, the, church, history, journal, pier, franco, beatrice, reports, that, eusebius, testified, that, the, word, homoousios, consubstantial, was, inserted, in, the, nicene, creed, solely, by, the, personal, order, of, constantine, according, to, eusebius, of, caesarea, the, word, homoousios, was, inserted, in, the, nicene, creed, solely, by, the, personal, order, of, constantine, but, this, statement, is, highly, problematic, it, is, very, difficult, to, explain, the, seeming, paradoxical, fact, that, this, word, along, with, the, explanation, given, by, constantine, was, accepted, by, the, arian, eusebius, whereas, it, has, left, no, traces, at, all, in, the, works, of, his, opponents, the, leaders, of, the, anti, arian, party, such, as, alexander, of, alexandria, ossius, of, cordova, marcellus, of, ancyra, and, eustathius, of, antioch, who, are, usually, considered, constantine, s, theological, advisers, and, the, strongest, supporters, of, the, council, neither, before, nor, during, constantine, s, time, is, there, any, evidence, of, a, normal, well, established, christian, use, of, the, term, homoousios, in, its, strictly, trinitarian, meaning, having, once, excluded, any, relationship, of, the, nicene, homoousios, with, the, christian, tradition, it, becomes, legitimate, to, propose, a, new, explanation, based, on, an, analysis, of, two, pagan, documents, which, have, so, far, never, been, taken, into, account, the, main, thesis, of, this, paper, is, that, homoousios, came, straight, from, constantine, s, hermetic, background, as, can, be, clearly, seen, in, the, poimandres, and, even, more, clearly, in, an, inscription, mentioned, exclusively, in, the, theosophia, in, the, theological,
