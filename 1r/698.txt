pedro, lvares, cabral, european, portuguese, born, pedro, lvares, de, gouveia, c, 1467, or, 1468, c, 1520, was, a, portuguese, nobleman, military, commander, navigator, and, explorer, regarded, as, the, european, discoverer, of, brazil, he, was, the, first, human, in, history, to, ever, be, on, four, continents, uniting, all, of, them, in, his, famous, voyage, of, 1500, where, he, also, conducted, the, first, substantial, exploration, of, the, northeast, coast, of, south, america, and, claimed, it, for, portugal, while, details, of, cabral, s, early, life, remain, unclear, it, is, known, that, he, came, from, a, minor, noble, family, and, received, a, good, education, he, was, appointed, to, head, an, expedition, to, india, in, 1500, following, vasco, da, gama, s, newly, opened, route, around, africa, the, undertaking, had, the, aim, of, returning, with, valuable, spices, and, of, establishing, trade, relations, in, india, bypassing, the, monopoly, on, the, spice, trade, then, in, the, hands, of, arab, turkish, and, italian, merchants, although, the, previous, expedition, of, vasco, da, gama, to, india, on, its, sea, route, had, recorded, signs, of, land, west, of, the, southern, atlantic, ocean, in, 1497, cabral, led, the, first, known, expedition, to, have, touched, four, continents, europe, africa, america, and, asia, his, fleet, of, 13, ships, sailed, far, into, the, western, atlantic, ocean, perhaps, intentionally, and, made, landfall, april, 1500, on, what, he, initially, assumed, to, be, a, large, island, as, the, new, land, was, within, the, portuguese, sphere, according, to, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, cabral, claimed, it, for, the, portuguese, crown, he, explored, the, coast, realizing, that, the, large, land, mass, was, probably, a, continent, and, dispatched, a, ship, to, notify, king, manuel, i, of, the, new, territory, the, continent, was, south, america, and, the, land, he, had, claimed, for, portugal, later, came, to, be, known, as, brazil, the, fleet, reprovisioned, and, then, turned, eastward, to, resume, the, journey, to, india, a, storm, in, the, southern, atlantic, caused, the, loss, of, several, ships, and, the, six, remaining, ships, eventually, rendezvoused, in, the, mozambique, channel, before, proceeding, to, calicut, in, india, cabral, was, originally, successful, in, negotiating, trading, rights, but, arab, merchants, saw, portugal, s, venture, as, a, threat, to, their, monopoly, and, stirred, up, an, attack, by, both, muslims, and, hindus, on, the, portuguese, entrep, t, the, portuguese, sustained, many, casualties, and, their, facilities, were, destroyed, cabral, took, vengeance, by, looting, and, burning, the, arab, fleet, and, then, bombarded, the, city, in, retaliation, for, its, ruler, having, failed, to, explain, the, unexpected, attack, from, calicut, the, expedition, sailed, to, the, kingdom, of, cochin, another, indian, city, state, where, cabral, befriended, its, ruler, and, loaded, his, ships, with, coveted, spices, before, returning, to, europe, despite, the, loss, of, human, lives, and, ships, cabral, s, voyage, was, deemed, a, success, upon, his, return, to, portugal, the, extraordinary, profits, resulting, from, the, sale, of, the, spices, bolstered, the, portuguese, crown, s, finances, and, helped, lay, the, foundation, of, a, portuguese, empire, that, would, stretch, from, the, americas, to, the, far, east, cabral, was, later, passed, over, possibly, as, a, result, of, a, quarrel, with, manuel, i, when, a, new, fleet, was, assembled, to, establish, a, more, robust, presence, in, india, having, lost, favor, with, the, king, he, retired, to, a, private, life, of, which, few, records, survive, his, accomplishments, slipped, mostly, into, obscurity, for, more, than, 300, years, decades, after, brazil, s, independence, from, portugal, in, the, 19th, century, cabral, s, reputation, began, to, be, rehabilitated, by, emperor, pedro, ii, of, brazil, historians, have, long, argued, whether, cabral, was, brazil, s, discoverer, and, whether, the, discovery, was, accidental, or, intentional, the, first, question, has, been, settled, by, the, observation, that, the, few, cursory, encounters, by, explorers, before, him, were, barely, noticed, at, the, time, and, contributed, nothing, to, the, future, development, and, history, of, the, land, which, would, become, brazil, the, sole, portuguese, speaking, nation, in, the, americas, on, the, second, question, no, definite, consensus, has, been, formed, and, the, intentional, discovery, hypothesis, lacks, solid, proof, nevertheless, although, he, was, overshadowed, by, contemporary, explorers, historians, consider, cabral, to, be, a, major, figure, of, the, age, of, discovery, little, is, certain, regarding, pedro, lvares, cabral, s, life, before, or, following, his, voyage, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, brazil, he, was, born, in, 1467, or, 1468, the, former, year, being, the, more, likely, at, belmonte, about, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, from, present, day, covilh, in, central, portugal, he, was, a, son, of, fern, o, lvares, cabral, and, isabel, gouveia, one, of, five, boys, and, six, girls, in, the, family, cabral, was, christened, pedro, lvares, de, gouveia, and, only, later, supposedly, upon, his, elder, brother, s, death, in, 1503, did, he, begin, using, his, father, s, surname, the, coat, of, arms, of, his, family, was, drawn, with, two, purple, goats, on, a, field, of, silver, purple, represented, fidelity, and, the, goats, were, derived, from, the, family, name, cabral, pertains, to, goats, in, english, however, only, his, elder, brother, was, entitled, to, make, use, of, the, family, arms, family, lore, said, that, the, cabrais, were, descendants, of, caranus, the, legendary, first, king, of, macedonia, caranus, was, in, turn, a, supposed, 7th, generation, scion, of, the, demigod, hercules, myths, aside, the, historian, james, mcclymont, believes, that, another, family, tale, might, hold, clues, to, the, true, origin, of, cabral, s, family, according, to, that, tradition, the, cabrais, derive, from, a, castilian, clan, named, the, cabreiras, cabra, is, spanish, for, goat, who, bore, a, similar, coat, of, arms, the, cabral, family, rose, to, prominence, during, the, 14th, century, lvaro, gil, cabral, cabral, s, great, great, grandfather, and, a, frontier, military, commander, was, one, of, the, few, portuguese, nobles, to, remain, loyal, to, dom, jo, o, i, king, of, portugal, during, the, war, against, the, king, of, castile, as, a, reward, jo, o, i, presented, lvaro, gil, with, the, hereditary, fiefdom, of, belmonte, raised, as, a, member, of, the, lower, nobility, cabral, was, sent, to, the, court, of, king, dom, afonso, v, in, 1479, at, around, age, 12, he, received, an, education, in, the, humanities, and, learned, to, bear, arms, and, fight, he, would, have, been, roughly, age, 17, on, 30, june, 1484, when, he, was, named, mo, o, fidalgo, young, nobleman, a, minor, title, then, commonly, granted, to, young, nobles, by, king, dom, jo, o, ii, records, of, his, deeds, prior, to, 1500, are, extremely, fragmentary, but, cabral, may, have, campaigned, in, north, africa, as, had, his, ancestors, and, as, was, commonly, done, by, other, young, nobles, of, his, day, king, dom, manuel, i, who, had, acceded, to, the, throne, two, years, previously, awarded, him, an, annual, allowance, worth, 30, 000, reais, on, 12, april, 1497, he, was, concurrently, given, the, title, fidalgo, nobleman, in, the, king, s, council, and, was, named, a, knight, of, the, order, of, christ, there, is, no, contemporary, image, or, detailed, physical, description, of, cabral, it, is, known, that, he, had, a, strong, build, and, matched, his, father, s, height, of, 190, cm, 6, ft, 2, 8, in, cabral, s, character, has, been, described, as, well, learned, courteous, prudent, generous, tolerant, with, enemies, humble, but, also, vain, and, too, concerned, with, the, respect, he, felt, his, honor, and, position, demanded, on, 15, february, 1500, cabral, was, appointed, capit, o, mor, literally, major, captain, or, commander, in, chief, of, a, fleet, sailing, for, india, it, was, then, the, custom, for, the, portuguese, crown, to, appoint, nobles, to, naval, and, military, commands, regardless, of, experience, or, professional, competence, this, was, the, case, for, the, captains, of, the, ships, under, cabral, s, command, most, were, nobles, like, himself, the, practice, had, obvious, pitfalls, since, authority, could, as, easily, be, given, to, highly, incompetent, and, unfit, people, as, it, could, fall, to, talented, leaders, such, as, afonso, de, albuquerque, or, dom, jo, o, de, castro, scant, details, have, survived, regarding, the, criteria, used, by, the, portuguese, government, in, its, selection, of, cabral, as, head, of, the, india, expedition, in, the, royal, decree, naming, him, commander, in, chief, the, only, reasons, given, are, merits, and, services, nothing, more, is, known, about, these, qualifications, historian, william, greenlee, argued, that, king, manuel, i, had, undoubtedly, known, him, well, at, court, that, along, with, the, standing, of, the, cabral, family, their, unquestioned, loyalty, to, the, crown, the, personal, appearance, of, cabral, and, the, ability, which, he, had, shown, at, court, and, in, the, council, were, important, factors, also, in, his, favor, may, have, been, the, influence, of, two, of, his, brothers, who, sat, on, the, king, s, council, given, the, political, intrigue, present, at, court, cabral, may, have, been, part, of, a, faction, that, furthered, his, appointment, the, historian, malyn, newitt, subscribes, to, some, sort, of, ulterior, maneuvering, and, has, said, that, the, choice, of, cabral, was, a, deliberate, attempt, to, balance, the, interests, of, rival, factions, of, noble, families, for, he, appears, to, have, no, other, quality, to, recommend, him, and, no, known, experience, in, commanding, major, expeditions, cabral, became, the, military, chief, while, far, more, experienced, navigators, were, seconded, to, the, expedition, to, aid, him, in, naval, matters, the, most, important, of, these, were, bartolomeu, dias, diogo, dias, and, nicolau, coelho, they, would, along, with, the, other, captains, command, 13, ships, and, 1, 500, men, of, this, contingent, 700, were, soldiers, although, most, were, simple, commoners, who, had, no, training, or, previous, experience, in, combat, the, fleet, had, two, divisions, the, first, division, was, composed, of, nine, naus, carracks, and, two, round, caravels, and, was, headed, to, calicut, in, india, with, the, goal, of, establishing, trade, relations, and, a, factory, the, second, division, consisting, of, one, nau, and, one, round, caravel, set, sail, for, the, port, of, sofala, in, what, is, today, mozambique, in, exchange, for, leading, the, fleet, cabral, was, entitled, to, 10, 000, cruzados, an, old, portuguese, currency, equivalent, to, approximately, 35, kg, of, gold, and, the, right, to, purchase, 30, tonnes, 33, short, tons, 30, long, tons, of, pepper, at, his, own, expense, for, transport, back, to, europe, the, pepper, could, then, be, resold, tax, free, to, the, portuguese, crown, he, was, also, allowed, to, import, 10, boxes, of, any, other, kind, of, spice, duty, free, although, the, voyage, was, extremely, hazardous, cabral, had, the, prospect, of, becoming, a, very, rich, man, if, he, returned, safely, to, portugal, with, the, cargo, spices, were, then, rare, in, europe, and, keenly, sought, after, an, earlier, fleet, had, been, the, first, to, reach, india, by, circumnavigating, africa, that, expedition, had, been, led, by, vasco, da, gama, and, returned, to, portugal, in, 1499, for, decades, portugal, had, been, searching, for, an, alternate, route, to, the, east, in, order, to, bypass, the, mediterranean, sea, which, was, under, the, control, of, the, italian, maritime, republics, and, the, ottoman, empire, portugal, s, expansionism, would, lead, first, to, a, route, to, india, and, later, to, worldwide, colonization, a, desire, to, spread, catholic, christianity, to, pagan, lands, was, another, factor, motivating, exploration, there, also, was, a, long, tradition, of, pushing, back, muslims, which, stemmed, from, portugal, s, fight, for, nationhood, against, the, moors, the, fight, expanded, first, to, north, africa, and, eventually, to, the, indian, subcontinent, an, additional, ambition, which, galvanized, the, explorers, was, the, search, for, the, mythical, prester, john, a, powerful, christian, king, with, whom, an, alliance, against, islam, could, be, forged, finally, the, portuguese, crown, sought, a, share, in, the, lucrative, west, african, trade, of, slaves, and, gold, and, india, s, spice, trade, the, fleet, under, the, command, of, the, 32, year, old, cabral, departed, from, lisbon, on, 9, march, 1500, at, noon, the, previous, day, it, had, been, given, a, public, send, off, which, included, a, mass, and, celebrations, attended, by, the, king, his, court, and, a, huge, crowd, on, the, morning, of, 14, march, the, flotilla, passed, gran, canaria, in, the, canary, islands, it, sailed, onward, to, cape, verde, a, portuguese, colony, situated, on, the, west, african, coast, which, was, reached, on, 22, march, the, next, day, a, nau, commanded, by, vasco, de, ata, de, with, 150, men, disappeared, without, a, trace, the, fleet, crossed, the, equator, on, 9, april, and, sailed, westward, as, far, as, possible, from, the, african, continent, in, what, was, known, as, the, volta, do, mar, literally, turn, of, the, sea, navigational, technique, seaweed, was, sighted, on, 21, april, which, led, the, sailors, to, believe, that, they, were, nearing, the, coast, they, were, proven, correct, the, next, afternoon, wednesday, 22, april, 1500, when, the, fleet, anchored, near, what, cabral, christened, the, monte, pascoal, easter, mount, it, being, the, week, of, easter, the, spot, is, on, the, northeast, coast, of, present, day, brazil, the, portuguese, detected, inhabitants, on, the, shore, and, all, ships, captains, gathered, aboard, cabral, s, lead, ship, on, 23, april, cabral, ordered, nicolau, coelho, a, captain, who, had, experience, from, vasco, da, gama, s, voyage, to, india, to, go, ashore, and, make, contact, he, set, foot, on, land, and, exchanged, gifts, with, the, indigenous, people, after, coelho, returned, cabral, took, the, fleet, north, where, after, traveling, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, along, the, coast, it, anchored, on, 24, april, in, what, the, commander, in, chief, named, porto, seguro, safe, port, the, place, was, a, natural, harbor, and, afonso, lopes, pilot, of, the, lead, ship, brought, two, natives, aboard, to, confer, with, cabral, as, in, the, first, contact, the, meeting, was, friendly, and, cabral, presented, the, locals, with, gifts, the, inhabitants, were, stone, age, hunter, gatherers, to, whom, the, europeans, had, assigned, the, collective, label, indians, the, men, collected, food, by, stalking, game, fishing, and, foraging, while, the, women, engaged, in, small, scale, farming, they, were, divided, into, countless, rival, tribes, the, tribe, which, cabral, met, was, the, tupiniquim, some, of, these, groups, were, nomadic, and, others, sedentary, having, a, knowledge, of, fire, but, not, metalworking, a, few, tribes, engaged, in, cannibalism, on, 26, april, as, more, and, more, curious, and, friendly, natives, appeared, cabral, ordered, his, men, to, build, an, altar, inland, where, a, christian, mass, was, held, the, first, celebrated, on, the, soil, of, what, would, later, become, brazil, he, along, with, the, ships, crews, participated, the, following, days, were, spent, stockpiling, water, food, wood, and, other, provisions, the, portuguese, also, built, a, massive, perhaps, 7, metres, 23, ft, long, wooden, cross, cabral, ascertained, that, the, new, land, lay, east, of, the, demarcation, line, between, portugal, and, spain, that, had, been, specified, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, the, territory, was, thus, within, the, sphere, allotted, to, portugal, to, solemnize, portugal, s, claim, to, the, land, the, wooden, cross, was, erected, and, a, second, religious, service, was, held, on, 1, may, in, honor, of, the, cross, cabral, named, the, newly, discovered, land, ilha, de, vera, cruz, island, of, the, true, cross, the, next, day, a, supply, ship, under, the, command, of, either, gaspar, de, lemos, or, andr, gon, alves, the, sources, conflict, on, who, was, sent, returned, to, portugal, to, apprise, the, king, of, the, discovery, the, fleet, resumed, its, voyage, on, either, 2, or, 3, may, 1500, and, sailed, along, the, east, coast, of, south, america, cabral, became, convinced, that, he, had, found, an, entire, continent, rather, than, an, island, around, 5, may, the, fleet, veered, eastwards, towards, africa, on, 23, or, 24, may, they, encountered, a, storm, in, the, south, atlantic, s, high, pressure, zone, resulting, in, the, loss, of, four, ships, the, exact, location, of, the, disaster, is, unknown, speculations, range, from, near, the, cape, of, good, hope, at, the, southern, tip, of, the, african, continent, to, within, sight, of, the, south, american, coast, three, naus, and, a, caravel, commanded, by, bartolomeu, dias, the, first, european, to, reach, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1488, foundered, and, 380, men, were, lost, the, remaining, vessels, hindered, by, rough, weather, and, damaged, rigging, were, separated, one, ship, that, had, been, separated, commanded, by, diogo, dias, wandered, onward, alone, and, the, other, six, ships, were, able, to, regroup, they, gathered, into, two, formations, consisting, of, three, ships, each, and, cabral, s, group, sailed, east, past, the, cape, of, good, hope, fixing, their, position, and, sighting, land, they, turned, north, and, landed, somewhere, in, the, primeiras, and, segundas, archipelago, off, east, africa, and, north, of, sofala, the, main, fleet, remained, near, sofala, ten, days, undergoing, repairs, the, expedition, then, went, north, and, on, 26, may, reached, kilwa, kisiwani, where, cabral, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, negotiate, a, treaty, with, its, king, from, kilwa, kisiwani, the, fleet, departed, to, malindi, which, was, reached, on, 2, august, cabral, met, with, its, king, with, whom, he, established, friendly, relations, and, exchanged, gifts, pilots, were, recruited, at, malindi, for, the, last, leg, to, india, and, the, fleet, set, sail, land, was, reached, at, anjadip, an, island, frequented, by, ships, to, obtain, supplies, on, their, way, to, calicut, here, the, ships, were, beached, recaulked, and, painted, final, arrangements, were, put, into, place, for, the, encounter, with, the, ruler, of, calicut, the, fleet, departed, anjadip, and, arrived, in, calicut, on, 13, september, cabral, successfully, negotiated, with, the, zamorin, the, title, of, the, ruler, of, calicut, and, obtained, permission, to, establish, a, factory, and, a, warehouse, in, hopes, of, further, improving, relations, cabral, dispatched, his, men, on, several, military, missions, at, the, zamorin, s, request, however, on, 16, or, 17, december, the, factory, suffered, a, surprise, attack, by, some, 300, according, to, other, accounts, perhaps, as, many, as, several, thousand, arabs, and, indians, despite, a, desperate, defense, by, crossbowmen, more, than, 50, portuguese, were, killed, the, remaining, defenders, retreated, to, the, ships, some, by, swimming, thinking, that, the, attack, was, the, result, of, unauthorized, incitement, by, jealous, arab, merchants, cabral, waited, 24, hours, for, an, explanation, from, the, ruler, of, calicut, but, no, apology, was, forthcoming, the, portuguese, were, outraged, by, the, attack, on, the, factory, and, the, death, of, their, comrades, and, seized, ten, arab, merchant, ships, at, anchor, in, the, harbor, around, 600, of, their, crews, were, killed, and, the, cargoes, confiscated, before, the, merchantmen, were, set, afire, cabral, also, ordered, his, ships, to, bombard, calicut, for, an, entire, day, in, reprisal, for, the, violation, of, the, agreement, the, massacre, was, blamed, in, part, on, portuguese, animosity, towards, muslims, which, had, developed, over, centuries, of, conflict, with, the, moors, on, the, iberian, peninsula, and, in, north, africa, moreover, the, portuguese, were, determined, to, dominate, the, spice, trade, and, had, no, intention, of, allowing, competition, to, flourish, the, arabs, also, had, no, desire, to, allow, the, portuguese, to, break, their, monopoly, on, access, to, spices, the, portuguese, had, started, out, by, insisting, on, being, given, preferential, treatment, in, every, aspect, of, the, trade, the, letter, from, king, manuel, i, brought, by, cabral, to, the, ruler, of, calicut, which, was, translated, by, the, ruler, s, arab, interpreters, sought, the, exclusion, of, arab, traders, the, arab, merchants, believed, that, they, were, about, to, lose, both, their, trading, opportunities, and, livelihoods, and, attempted, to, sway, the, zamorin, against, the, portuguese, the, portuguese, and, arabs, were, extremely, suspicious, of, each, other, s, every, action, historian, william, greenlee, has, argued, that, the, portuguese, realized, that, they, were, few, in, numbers, and, that, those, who, would, come, to, india, in, the, future, fleets, would, always, be, at, a, numerical, disadvantage, so, that, this, treachery, must, be, punished, in, a, manner, so, decisive, that, the, portuguese, would, be, feared, and, respected, in, the, future, it, was, their, superior, artillery, which, would, enable, them, to, accomplish, this, end, thus, they, created, a, precedent, for, the, gunboat, diplomacy, used, by, european, powers, in, asia, during, the, following, centuries, warnings, in, reports, from, vasco, da, gama, s, voyage, to, india, had, prompted, king, manuel, i, to, brief, cabral, regarding, another, port, to, the, south, of, calicut, where, he, could, also, trade, this, city, was, cochin, and, the, fleet, set, sail, reaching, it, on, 24, december, cochin, was, nominally, a, vassal, of, calicut, as, well, as, being, dominated, by, other, indian, cities, cochin, was, eager, to, achieve, independence, and, the, portuguese, were, willing, to, exploit, indian, disunity, to, further, their, own, goals, this, tactic, eventually, ensured, portuguese, hegemony, over, the, region, cabral, forged, an, alliance, with, cochin, s, ruler, as, well, as, with, rulers, of, other, indian, cities, and, was, able, to, establish, a, factory, at, last, loaded, with, precious, spices, the, fleet, went, to, kannur, for, further, trade, before, setting, out, on, its, return, voyage, to, portugal, on, 16, january, 1501, the, expedition, headed, for, the, east, coast, of, africa, one, of, the, ships, became, stranded, on, a, sandbar, and, the, vessel, began, to, founder, as, there, was, no, space, in, the, other, ships, its, cargo, was, lost, and, cabral, ordered, the, carrack, to, be, set, on, fire, the, fleet, then, proceeded, to, the, island, of, mozambique, northeast, of, sofala, in, order, to, take, on, provisions, and, make, the, ships, ready, for, the, rough, passage, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, one, caravel, was, sent, to, sofala, another, of, the, expedition, s, goals, a, second, caravel, considered, the, fastest, ship, in, the, fleet, and, captained, by, nicolau, coelho, was, sent, ahead, to, give, the, king, advance, notice, of, the, voyage, s, success, a, third, vessel, commanded, by, pedro, de, ata, de, became, separated, from, the, fleet, after, leaving, mozambique, on, 22, may, the, fleet, now, reduced, to, only, two, ships, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, they, arrived, in, beseguiche, now, dakar, located, near, cape, verde, on, 2, june, there, they, found, not, only, nicolau, coelho, s, caravel, but, also, the, nau, captained, by, diogo, dias, which, had, been, lost, for, over, a, year, following, the, disaster, in, the, south, atlantic, the, nau, had, experienced, several, adventures, of, its, own, and, was, now, in, poor, condition, with, only, seven, sick, and, malnourished, men, aboard, one, of, whom, was, so, weak, that, he, died, of, happiness, upon, again, seeing, his, comrades, another, portuguese, fleet, was, also, found, riding, at, anchor, in, beseguiche, after, manuel, i, had, been, told, of, the, discovery, of, what, is, now, brazil, he, sent, another, and, smaller, fleet, to, explore, it, one, of, its, navigators, was, amerigo, vespucci, for, whom, the, americas, would, be, named, who, told, cabral, of, his, exploration, confirming, that, he, had, indeed, made, landfall, on, an, entire, continent, and, not, merely, an, island, nicolau, coelho, s, caravel, departed, first, from, beseguiche, and, arrived, in, portugal, on, 23, june, 1501, cabral, stayed, behind, waiting, for, pedro, de, ata, de, s, missing, ship, and, for, the, caravel, that, had, been, sent, to, sofala, both, eventually, appeared, and, cabral, arrived, in, portugal, on, 21, july, 1501, with, the, other, vessels, coming, home, during, the, following, days, in, all, two, ships, returned, empty, five, were, fully, loaded, and, six, were, lost, nonetheless, the, cargoes, carried, by, the, fleet, returned, up, to, 800, profit, to, the, portuguese, crown, once, sold, the, proceeds, covered, the, outlay, in, equipping, the, fleet, covered, the, cost, of, the, vessels, which, had, been, lost, and, cleared, a, profit, which, itself, exceeded, the, total, sum, of, those, costs, undeterred, by, the, unprecedented, losses, which, he, had, sustained, asserts, historian, james, mcclymont, when, cabral, reached, the, east, african, coast, pressed, forward, to, the, accomplishment, of, the, task, which, had, been, assigned, to, him, and, was, able, to, inspire, the, surviving, officers, and, men, with, like, courage, few, voyages, to, brazil, and, india, were, so, well, executed, as, cabral, s, affirmed, historian, bailey, diffie, which, laid, down, a, path, leading, to, the, immediate, commencement, of, a, portuguese, seagoing, empire, from, africa, to, the, far, east, and, eventually, to, a, land, empire, in, brazil, upon, cabral, s, return, king, manuel, i, began, planning, another, fleet, to, make, the, journey, to, india, and, to, avenge, the, portuguese, losses, in, calicut, cabral, was, selected, to, command, this, revenge, fleet, as, it, was, called, for, eight, months, cabral, made, all, preparations, but, for, reasons, which, remain, uncertain, he, was, relieved, of, command, it, had, apparently, been, proposed, to, give, another, navigator, vicente, sodr, independent, command, over, a, section, of, the, fleet, and, cabral, strongly, opposed, this, whether, he, was, dismissed, or, requested, himself, that, he, be, relieved, of, command, the, result, was, that, when, the, fleet, departed, in, march, 1502, its, commander, was, vasco, da, gama, a, maternal, nephew, of, vicente, sodr, and, not, cabral, it, is, known, that, hostility, had, developed, between, a, faction, supporting, da, gama, and, another, supporting, cabral, at, some, point, cabral, left, the, court, permanently, the, king, was, greatly, irritated, by, the, feud, to, such, an, extent, that, mentioning, the, matter, in, his, presence, could, result, in, banishment, as, it, did, for, one, of, da, gama, s, supporters, despite, the, loss, of, favor, with, manuel, i, cabral, was, able, to, contract, an, advantageous, marriage, in, 1503, to, dona, lady, isabel, de, castro, a, wealthy, noblewoman, and, descendant, of, king, dom, fernando, i, of, portugal, her, mother, was, a, sister, of, afonso, de, albuquerque, one, of, the, greatest, portuguese, military, leaders, during, the, age, of, discovery, the, couple, had, at, least, four, children, two, boys, fern, o, lvares, cabral, and, ant, nio, cabral, and, two, girls, catarina, de, castro, and, guiomar, de, castro, there, were, two, additional, daughters, named, isabel, and, leonor, according, to, other, sources, which, also, say, that, guiomar, isabel, and, leonor, joined, religious, orders, afonso, de, albuquerque, attempted, to, intercede, on, cabral, s, behalf, and, on, 2, december, 1514, asked, manuel, i, to, forgive, him, and, allow, his, return, to, court, but, to, no, avail, suffering, from, recurrent, fever, and, a, tremor, possibly, malaria, since, his, voyage, cabral, withdrew, to, santar, m, in, 1509, he, spent, his, remaining, years, there, only, sketchy, information, is, available, as, to, his, activities, during, that, time, according, to, a, royal, letter, dated, 17, december, 1509, cabral, was, party, to, a, dispute, over, a, transaction, involving, property, which, belonged, to, him, another, letter, of, that, same, year, reported, that, he, was, to, receive, certain, privileges, for, undisclosed, military, service, in, 1518, or, perhaps, previously, he, was, raised, from, fidalgo, to, knight, in, the, king, s, council, and, was, entitled, to, a, monthly, allowance, of, 2, 437, reais, this, was, in, addition, to, the, annual, allowance, granted, to, him, in, 1497, and, still, being, paid, cabral, died, of, unspecified, causes, most, probably, in, 1520, he, was, buried, in, the, s, o, jo, o, evangelista, chapel, of, the, convento, da, gra, a, in, santar, m, the, first, permanent, portuguese, settlement, in, the, land, which, would, become, brazil, was, s, o, vicente, which, was, established, in, 1532, by, martim, afonso, de, sousa, as, the, years, passed, the, portuguese, would, slowly, expand, their, frontiers, westward, conquering, more, lands, from, both, indigenous, americans, and, the, spanish, brazil, had, secured, most, of, its, present, day, borders, by, 1750, and, was, regarded, by, portugal, as, the, most, important, part, of, its, far, flung, maritime, empire, on, 7, september, 1822, the, heir, of, portuguese, king, dom, jo, o, vi, secured, the, independence, of, brazil, from, portugal, and, as, dom, pedro, i, became, its, first, emperor, cabral, s, discovery, and, even, his, resting, place, in, the, land, of, his, birth, had, been, almost, completely, forgotten, during, the, span, of, nearly, 300, years, since, his, expedition, this, began, to, change, beginning, in, the, 1840s, when, emperor, dom, pedro, ii, successor, and, son, of, pedro, i, sponsored, research, and, publications, dealing, with, cabral, s, life, and, expedition, through, the, brazilian, historic, and, geographic, institute, this, was, part, of, the, emperor, s, ambitious, larger, plan, to, foster, and, strengthen, a, sense, of, nationalism, among, brazil, s, diverse, citizenry, giving, them, a, common, identity, and, history, as, residents, of, a, unique, portuguese, speaking, empire, surrounded, by, hispanic, american, republics, the, initial, resurgence, of, interest, in, cabral, had, resulted, from, the, rediscovery, in, 1839, of, his, resting, place, by, the, brazilian, historian, francisco, adolfo, de, varnhagen, later, viscount, of, porto, seguro, the, completely, neglected, state, in, which, cabral, s, tomb, was, found, nearly, led, to, a, diplomatic, crisis, between, brazil, and, portugal, the, latter, then, ruled, by, pedro, ii, s, eldest, sister, maria, ii, in, 1871, the, brazilian, emperor, then, on, a, trip, to, europe, visited, cabral, s, gravesite, and, proposed, an, exhumation, for, scientific, study, which, was, carried, out, in, 1882, in, a, second, exhumation, in, 1896, an, urn, containing, earth, and, bone, fragments, was, allowed, to, be, removed, although, his, remains, still, lay, in, portugal, the, urn, was, eventually, brought, to, the, old, cathedral, of, rio, de, janeiro, in, brazil, on, 30, december, 1903, cabral, has, since, become, a, national, hero, in, brazil, in, portugal, however, he, has, been, much, overshadowed, by, his, rival, vasco, da, gama, historian, william, greenlee, argued, that, cabral, s, exploration, is, important, not, only, because, of, its, position, in, the, history, of, geography, but, because, of, its, influence, on, the, history, and, economics, of, the, period, though, he, acknowledges, that, few, voyages, have, been, of, greater, importance, to, posterity, he, also, says, that, few, have, been, less, appreciated, in, their, time, nevertheless, historian, james, mcclymont, affirmed, that, cabral, s, position, in, the, history, of, portuguese, conquest, and, discovery, is, inexpungable, despite, the, supremacy, of, greater, or, more, fortunate, men, he, concluded, that, cabral, will, always, be, remembered, in, history, as, the, chief, if, not, the, first, discoverer, of, brazil, a, controversy, that, has, occupied, scholars, for, more, than, a, century, concerns, whether, cabral, s, discovery, was, by, chance, or, intentional, the, latter, would, mean, that, the, portuguese, at, least, suspected, that, land, existed, to, the, west, the, question, was, first, broached, by, emperor, pedro, ii, in, 1854, during, a, session, of, the, brazilian, historic, and, geographic, institute, when, he, asked, if, the, discovery, might, have, been, intentional, until, the, 1854, conference, the, widespread, presumption, was, that, the, discovery, had, been, an, accident, early, works, on, the, subject, supported, this, view, including, hist, ria, do, descobrimento, e, conquista, da, ndia, history, of, the, discovery, and, conquest, of, india, published, in, 1541, by, fern, o, lopes, de, castanheda, d, cadas, da, sia, decades, of, asia, 1552, by, jo, o, de, barros, cr, nicas, do, felic, ssimo, rei, d, manuel, chronicles, of, the, most, fortunate, d, manuel, 1558, by, dami, o, de, g, is, lendas, da, ndia, legends, of, india, 1561, by, gaspar, correia, hist, ria, do, brasil, history, of, brazil, 1627, by, friar, vicente, do, salvador, and, hist, ria, da, am, rica, portuguesa, history, of, portuguese, america, 1730, by, sebasti, o, da, rocha, pita, the, first, work, to, advocate, the, idea, of, intentionality, was, published, in, 1854, by, joaquim, noberto, de, sousa, e, silva, after, pedro, ii, had, opened, the, debate, since, then, several, scholars, have, subscribed, to, that, view, including, francisco, adolfo, de, varnhagen, capistrano, de, abreu, pedro, calmon, f, bio, ramos, and, m, rio, barata, historian, h, lio, vianna, affirmed, that, although, there, are, signs, of, the, intentionality, in, cabral, s, discovery, based, mainly, in, the, knowledge, or, previous, suspicion, of, the, existence, of, lands, at, the, edge, of, the, south, atlantic, there, are, no, irrefutable, proofs, to, support, it, this, opinion, is, also, shared, by, historian, thomas, skidmore, the, debate, on, whether, it, was, a, deliberate, voyage, of, discovery, or, not, is, considered, irrelevant, by, historian, charles, r, boxer, historian, anthony, smith, concludes, that, the, conflicting, contentions, will, probably, never, be, resolved, cabral, was, not, the, first, european, to, stumble, upon, areas, of, present, day, brazil, not, to, mention, other, parts, of, south, america, norsemen, reached, north, america, and, even, established, settlements, although, these, ended, in, failure, sometime, before, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, christopher, columbus, on, his, third, voyage, to, the, new, world, in, 1498, traveled, along, part, of, what, would, later, become, venezuela, in, the, case, of, brazil, it, was, once, considered, probable, that, the, portuguese, navigator, duarte, pacheco, pereira, had, made, a, voyage, to, the, brazilian, coast, in, 1498, this, belief, has, since, been, dismissed, however, and, it, is, now, thought, that, he, voyaged, to, north, america, instead, there, is, more, certain, evidence, that, two, spaniards, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, and, diego, de, lepe, traveled, along, the, northern, coast, of, brazil, between, january, and, march, 1500, pinz, n, went, from, what, is, today, cabo, de, santo, agostinho, brazilian, state, of, pernambuco, to, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, there, he, encountered, another, spanish, expedition, led, by, lepe, which, would, reach, as, far, as, the, oyapock, river, in, march, the, reason, cabral, is, credited, with, having, discovered, brazil, rather, than, the, spanish, explorers, is, because, the, visits, by, pinz, n, and, lepe, were, cursory, and, had, no, lasting, impact, historians, capistrano, de, abreu, francisco, adolfo, de, varnhagen, m, rio, barata, and, h, lio, vianna, concur, that, the, spanish, expeditions, did, not, influence, the, development, of, what, would, become, the, only, portuguese, speaking, nation, in, the, americas, with, a, unique, history, culture, and, society, which, sets, it, apart, from, the, hispanic, american, societies, which, dominate, the, rest, of, the, continent
