son, prince, maximilian, the, return, of, austrian, provinces, and, vienna, if, they, would, renounce, the, treaty, of, 1463, and, accept, matthias, as, frederic, s, designated, heir, and, probable, the, inheritor, of, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, before, this, was, settled, though, matthias, died, in, vienna, in, 1490, king, matthias, was, happy, to, be, described, as, the, second, attila, the, chronica, hungarorum, by, johannes, thur, czy, published, in, 1488, set, the, goal, of, glorifying, attila, which, was, undeservedly, neglected, moreover, he, introduced, the, famous, scourge, of, god, characterization, to, the, later, hungarian, writers, because, the, earlier, chronicles, remained, hidden, for, a, long, time, thur, czy, worked, hard, to, endear, attila, the, hun, king, with, an, effort, far, surpassing, his, predecessor, chroniclers, he, made, attila, a, model, for, his, victorious, ruler, king, matthias, who, had, attila, s, abilities, with, this, he, almost, brought, the, hammer, of, the, world, to, life, according, to, the, contemporaneous, philippe, de, commines, matthias, s, subjects, feared, their, king, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, because, he, rarely, showed, mercy, towards, those, he, suspected, of, treachery, he, had, archbishop, peter, v, radi, imprisoned, in, 1484, and, ordered, the, execution, of, his, chancellor, of, bohemia, jaroslav, boskovic, in, 1485, he, also, imprisoned, nicholas, b, nfi, a, member, of, a, magnate, family, in, 1487, although, he, had, earlier, avoided, punishing, the, old, aristocracy, b, nfi, s, imprisonment, seems, to, have, been, connected, to, his, marriage, to, a, daughter, of, john, the, mad, duke, of, glogau, because, matthias, tried, to, seize, this, duchy, for, john, corvinus, john, the, mad, entered, into, an, alliance, with, the, duke, of, m, nsterberg, henry, of, pod, brady, and, declared, a, war, on, matthias, on, 9, may, six, month, later, the, black, army, invaded, and, occupied, his, duchy, in, the, meantime, the, citizens, of, ancona, a, town, in, the, papal, states, hoisted, matthias, s, flag, in, the, hope, he, would, protect, them, against, venice, pope, innocent, viii, soon, protested, but, matthias, refused, to, reject, the, overture, stating, that, the, link, between, him, and, the, town, would, never, harm, the, interests, of, the, holy, see, he, also, sent, an, auxiliary, troop, to, his, father, in, law, who, was, waging, a, war, against, the, holy, see, and, venice, the, 1482, truce, between, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, was, prolonged, for, two, years, in, 1488, on, this, occasion, it, was, stipulated, that, the, ottomans, were, to, refrain, from, invading, wallachia, and, moldavia, the, following, year, matthias, granted, two, domains, to, stephen, the, great, of, moldavia, in, transylvania, matthias, who, suffered, from, gout, could, not, walk, and, was, carried, in, a, litter, after, march, 1489, hereafter, his, succession, caused, bitter, conflicts, between, queen, beatrice, and, john, corvinus, matthias, asked, beatrice, s, brother, alfonso, duke, of, calabria, to, persuade, her, not, to, strive, for, the, crown, stating, that, the, hungarian, people, are, capable, of, killing, up, unto, the, last, man, rather, than, submit, to, the, government, of, a, woman, to, strengthen, his, illegitimate, son, s, position, matthias, even, proposed, withdrawing, from, austria, and, to, confirm, emperor, frederick, s, right, to, succeed, him, provided, the, emperor, was, willing, to, grant, croatia, and,
