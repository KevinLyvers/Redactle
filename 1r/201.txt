times, to, embark, on, an, extensive, research, journey, through, the, american, south, and, texas, from, 1852, to, 1857, his, dispatches, to, the, times, were, collected, into, three, volumes, a, journey, in, the, seaboard, slave, states, 1856, a, journey, through, texas, 1857, a, journey, in, the, back, country, in, the, winter, of, 1853, 4, 1860, these, are, considered, vivid, first, person, accounts, of, the, antebellum, south, a, one, volume, abridgment, journeys, and, explorations, in, the, cotton, kingdom, 1861, was, published, in, england, during, the, first, six, months, of, the, american, civil, war, at, the, suggestion, of, olmsted, s, english, publisher, to, this, he, wrote, a, new, introduction, on, the, present, crisis, he, stated, his, views, on, the, effect, of, slavery, on, the, economy, and, social, conditions, of, the, southern, states, my, own, observation, of, the, real, condition, of, the, people, of, our, slave, states, gave, me, an, impression, that, the, cotton, monopoly, in, some, way, did, them, more, harm, than, good, and, although, the, written, narration, of, what, i, saw, was, not, intended, to, set, this, forth, upon, reviewing, it, for, the, present, publication, i, find, the, impression, has, become, a, conviction, he, argued, that, slavery, had, made, the, slave, states, inefficient, a, set, amount, of, work, took, 4, times, as, long, in, virginia, as, in, the, north, and, backward, both, economically, and, socially, he, said, that, the, profits, of, slavery, were, enjoyed, by, no, more, than, 8, 000, owners, of, large, plantations, a, somewhat, larger, group, had, about, the, standard, of, living, of, a, new, york, city, policeman, but, the, proportion, of, the, free, white, men, who, were, as, well, off, as, a, northern, working, man, was, small, slavery, meant, that, the, proportion, of, men, improving, their, condition, was, much, less, than, in, any, northern, community, and, that, the, natural, resources, of, the, land, were, strangely, unused, or, were, used, with, poor, economy, he, thought, that, the, lack, of, a, southern, white, middle, class, and, the, general, poverty, of, lower, class, whites, prevented, the, development, of, many, civil, amenities, that, were, taken, for, granted, in, the, north, the, citizens, of, the, cotton, states, as, a, whole, are, poor, they, work, little, and, that, little, badly, they, earn, little, they, sell, little, they, buy, little, and, they, have, little, very, little, of, the, common, comforts, and, consolations, of, civilized, life, their, destitution, is, not, material, only, it, is, intellectual, and, it, is, moral, they, were, neither, generous, nor, hospitable, and, their, talk, was, not, that, of, evenly, courageous, men, between, his, travels, in, europe, and, the, south, olmsted, served, as, an, editor, for, putnam, s, magazine, for, two, years, and, as, an, agent, with, dix, edwards, and, co, before, the, company, s, insolvency, during, the, panic, of, 1857, olmsted, provided, financial, support, for, and, occasionally, wrote, for, the, magazine, the, nation, which, was, founded, in, 1865, olmsted, spent, much, of, his, free, time, working, without, pay, as, an, editorial, assistant, to, godkin, it, was, a, labor, of, love, andrew, jackson, downing, the, landscape, architect, from, newburgh, new, york, was, one, of, the, first, to, propose, developing, new, york, city, s, central, park, in, his, role, as, publisher, of, the, horticulturist, magazine, a, friend, and, mentor, to, olmsted, downing, introduced, him, to, the, english, born, architect, calvert, vaux, whom, downing, had, brought, to, the, u, s, as, his, architectural, collaborator, after, downing, died, in, july, 1852, in, a, widely, publicized, fire, on, the, hudson, river, steamboat, henry, clay, olmsted, and, vaux, entered, the, central, park, design, competition, together, against, egbert, ludovicus, viele, among, others, vaux, had, invited, the, less, experienced, olmsted, to, participate, in, the, design, competition, with, him, having, been, impressed, with, olmsted, s, theories, and, political, contacts, prior, to, this, in, contrast, with, the, more, experienced, vaux, olmsted, had, never, designed, or, executed, a, landscape, design, their, greensward, plan, was, announced, in, 1858, as, the, winning, design, on, his, return, from, the, south, olmsted, began, executing, their, plan, almost, immediately, olmsted, and, vaux, continued, their, informal, partnership, to, design, prospect, park, in, brooklyn, from, 1865, to, 1873, that, was, followed, by, other, projects, vaux, remained, in, the, shadow, of, olmsted, s, grand, public, personality, and, social, connections, the, design, of, central, park, embodies, olmsted, s, social, consciousness, and, commitment, to, egalitarian, ideals, influenced, by, downing, and, his, observations, regarding, social, class, in, england, china, and, the, american, south, olmsted, believed, that, the, common, green, space, must, always, be, equally, accessible, to, all, citizens, and, was, to, be, defended, against, private, encroachment, this, principle, is, now, fundamental, to, the, idea, of, a, public, park, but, was, not, assumed, as, necessary, then, olmsted, s, tenure, as, central, park, commissioner, was, a, long, struggle, to, preserve, that, idea, in, 1861, olmsted, took, leave, as, director, of, central, park, to, work, in, washington, d, c, as, executive, secretary, of, the, u, s, sanitary, commission, a, precursor, to, the, red, cross, he, tended, to, the, wounded, during, the, american, civil, war, in, 1862, during, union, general, george, b, mcclellan, s, peninsula, campaign, he, headed, the, medical, effort, for, the, sick, and, wounded, at, white, house, plantation, in, new, kent, county, which, had, a, boat, landing, on, the, pamunkey, river, he, was, one, of, the, six, founding, members, of, the, union, league, club, of, new, york, he, helped, to, recruit, and, outfit, three, african, american, regiments, of, the, united, states, colored, troops, in, new, york, city, he, contributed, to, organizing, a, sanitary, fair, which, raised, one, million, dollars, for, the, united, states, sanitary, commission, he, worked, for, the, sanitary, commission, to, the, point, of, exhaustion, part, of, the, problem, was, his, need, to, maintain, control, over, all, aspects, of, the, commission, s, work, he, refused, to, delegate, and, he, had, an, appetite, for, authority, and, power, by, january, 1863, a, friend, wrote, olmsted, is, in, an, unhappy, sick, sore, mental, state, he, works, like, a, dog, all, day, and, sits, up, nearly, all, night, works, with, steady, feverish, intensity, till, four, in, the, morning, sleeps, on, a, sofa, in, his, clothes, and, breakfasts, on, strong, coffee, and, pickles, his, overwork, and, lack, of, sleep, led, to, his, being, in, a, perpetual, state, of, irritability, which, wore, on, the, people, with, whom, he, worked, exhausted, ill, and, having, lost, the, support, of, the, men, who, put, him, in, charge, olmsted, resigned, on, sept, 1, 1863, yet, within, a, month, he, was, on, his, way, to, california, in, 1863, olmsted, went, west, to, become, the, manager, of, the, newly, established, rancho, las, mariposas, mariposa, gold, mining, estate, in, the, sierra, nevada, mountains, in, california, the, estate, had, been, sold, by, john, c, fremont, to, new, york, banker, morris, ketchum, in, january, of, that, same, year, the, mine, was, unsuccessful, by, 1865, the, mariposa, company, was, bankrupt, olmsted, returned, to, new, york, and, the, land, and, mines, were, sold, at, a, sheriff, s, sale, in, 1865, he, was, appointed, to, the, first, board, of, commissioners, for, managing, the, newly, established, yosemite, valley, and, mariposa, grove, land, grants, in, 1865, he, and, vaux, formed, olmsted, vaux, co, when, olmsted, returned, to, new, york, he, and, vaux, designed, prospect, park, the, planned, chicago, suburb, of, riverside, illinois, the, park, system, for, buffalo, new, york, milwaukee, s, grand, necklace, of, parks, and, the, niagara, reservation, at, niagara, falls, and, belle, isle, in, detroit, olmsted, conceived, of, entire, systems, of, parks, and, interconnecting, parkways, to, connect, certain, cities, to, green, spaces, some, of, the, best, examples, of, the, scale, on, which, he, worked, are, the, park, system, designed, for, buffalo, one, of, the, largest, projects, the, system, he, designed, for, milwaukee, and, the, park, system, designed, for, louisville, kentucky, which, was, one, of, only, four, completed, olmsted, designed, park, systems, in, the, world, olmsted, was, a, frequent, collaborator, with, architect, henry, hobson, richardson, for, whom, he, devised, the, landscaping, schemes, for, half, a, dozen, projects, including, richardson, s, commission, for, the, buffalo, state, asylum, in, 1871, olmsted, and, vaux, designed, the, grounds, for, the, hudson, river, state, hospital, for, the, insane, in, poughkeepsie, in, 1883, olmsted, established, what, is, considered, to, be, the, first, full, time, landscape, architecture, firm, in, brookline, massachusetts, he, called, the, home, and, office, compound, fairsted, it, is, now, the, restored, frederick, law, olmsted, national, historic, site, from, there, olmsted, designed, boston, s, emerald, necklace, the, campuses, of, wellesley, college, smith, college, stanford, university, and, the, university, of, chicago, as, well, as, the, 1893, world, s, fair, in, chicago, among, many, other, projects, olmsted, was, an, important, early, leader, of, the, conservation, movement, in, the, united, states, an, expert, on, california, he, was, likely, one, of, the, gentlemen, of, fortune, of, taste, and, of, refinement, who, proposed, through, senator, john, conness, that, congress, designate, yosemite, valley, and, mariposa, big, tree, grove, as, public, reserves, this, was, the, first, land, set, aside, by, congress, for, public, use, olmsted, served, a, one, year, appointment, on, the, board, of, commissioner, of, the, state, reserve, and, his, 1865, report, to, congress, on, the, board, s, recommendations, laid, an, ethical, framework, for, the, government, to, reserve, public, lands, to, protect, their, value, to, posterity, he, described, the, sublime, and, stately, landscape, emphasizing, that, the, value, of, the, landscape, was, not, in, any, one, individual, waterfall, cliff, or, tree, but, in, the, miles, of, scenery, where, cliffs, of, awful, height, and, rocks, of, vast, magnitude, and, of, varied, and, exquisite, coloring, are, banked, and, fringed, and, draped, and, shadowed, by, the, tender, foliage, of, noble, and, lovely, trees, and, bushes, reflected, from, the, most, placid, pools, and, associated, with, the, most, tranquil, meadows, the, most, playful, streams, and, every, variety, of, soft, and, peaceful, pastoral, beauty, in, the, 1880s, he, was, active, in, efforts, to, conserve, the, natural, wonders, of, niagara, falls, threatened, with, industrialization, by, the, building, of, electrical, power, plants, at, the, same, time, he, campaigned, to, preserve, the, adirondack, region, in, upstate, new, york, he, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, american, society, of, landscape, architects, in, 1898, olmsted, was, also, known, to, oppose, park, projects, on, conservationist, grounds, in, 1891, olmsted, refused, to, develop, a, plan, for, presque, isle, park, in, marquette, michigan, saying, that, it, should, not, be, marred, by, the, intrusion, of, artificial, objects, after, olmsted, s, retirement, and, death, his, sons, john, charles, olmsted, and, frederick, law, olmsted, jr, continued, the, work, of, their, firm, doing, business, as, the, olmsted, brothers, the, firm, lasted, until, 1980, many, works, by, the, olmsted, sons, are, mistakenly, credited, to, frederick, law, olmsted, today, for, instance, the, olmsted, brothers, firm, did, a, park, plan, for, portland, maine, in, 1905, creating, a, series, of, connecting, parkways, between, existing, parks, and, suggesting, improvements, to, those, parks, the, oldest, of, these, parks, deering, oaks, had, been, designed, by, city, engineer, william, goodwin, in, 1879, but, is, today, frequently, described, as, a, frederick, law, olmsted, designed, park, a, residence, hall, at, the, university, of, hartford, was, named, in, his, honor, olmsted, point, located, in, yosemite, national, park, was, named, after, olmsted, and, his, son, frederick, the, olmsted, center, located, in, queens, ny, pays, an, homage, to, frederick, law, olmsted, the, frederick, law, olmsted, national, historic, site, is, located, in, brookline, massachusetts, in, his, former, home, olmsted, is, known, as, the, father, of, american, landscape, architecture, on,

wedding, olmsted, adopted, mary, s, three, children, his, nephews, and, niece, john, charles, olmsted, born, 1852, charlotte, olmsted, born, 1855, and, owen, frederick, olmsted, born, 1857, frederick, and, mary, also, had, two, children, together, who, survived, infancy, a, daughter, marion, born, october, 28, 1861, and, a, son, frederick, law, olmsted, jr, born, july, 24, 1870, their, first,

the, massachusetts, commandery, of, the, military, order, of, the, loyal, legion, of, the, united, states, mollus, on, may, 2, 1888, and, was, assigned, insignia, number, 6345, olmsted, s, election, to, mollus, is, significant, in, that, he, was, one, of, the, few, civilians, elected, to, membership, in, an, organization, composed, almost, exclusively, of, military, officers, and, their, descendants, in, 1891, he, joined, the, connecticut, society, of, the, sons, of, the, american, revolution, by, right, of, his, descent, from, his, grandfather, benjamin, olmsted, who, served, in, the, 4th, connecticut, regiment, in, 1775, in, 1895, senility, forced, olmsted, to, retire, by, 1898, he, moved, to, belmont, massachusetts, and, took, up, residence, as, a, patient, at, the, mclean, hospital, for, whose, grounds, he, had, submitted, a, design, which, was, never, executed, he, remained, there, until, he, died, in, 1903, he, was, buried, in, the, old, north, cemetery, in, hartford, connecticut, drawing, influences, from, english, landscape, and, gardening, olmsted, emphasized, design, that, encourages, the, full, use, of, the, naturally, occurring, features, of, a, given, space, its, genius, the, subordination, of, individual, details, to, the, whole, so, that, decorative, elements, do, not, take, precedence, but, rather, the, whole, space, is, enhanced, concealment, of, design, design, that, does, not, call, attention, to, itself, design, that, works, on, the, unconscious, to, produce, relaxation, and, utility, or, purpose, over, ornamentation, a, bridge, a, pathway, a, tree, a, pasture, any, and, all, elements, are, brought, together, to, produce, a, particular, effect, olmsted, designed, primarily, in, pastoral, and, picturesque, styles, each, to, achieve, a, particular, effect, the, pastoral, style, featured, vast, expanses, of, green, with, small, lakes, trees, and, groves, and, produced, a, soothing, restorative, effect, on, the, viewer, the, picturesque, style, covered, rocky, broken, terrain, teeming, with, shrubs, and, creepers, to, express, nature, s, richness, the, picturesque, style, played, with, light, and, shade, to, lend, the, landscape, a, sense, of, mystery, scenery, was, designed, to, enhance, the, sense, of, space, indistinct, boundaries, using, plants, brush, and, trees, as, opposed, to, sharp, ones, the, interplay, of, light, and, shadow, close, up, and, blurred, detail, farther, away, he, employed, a, vast, expanse, of, greenery, at, the, end, of, which, would, lie, a, grove, of, yellow, poplar, a, path, that, winds, through, a, bit, of, landscape, and, intersects, with, others, dividing, the, terrain, into, triangular, islands, of, successive, new, views, subordination, strove, to, use, all, objects, and, features, in, the, service, of, the, design, and, its, intended, effect, it, can, be, seen, in, the, subtle, use, of, naturally, occurring, plants, throughout, the, park, non, native, species, planted, for, the, sake, of, their, own, uniqueness, was, seen, as, defeating, the, purpose, of, design, as, that, very, uniqueness, would, draw, attention, to, itself, where, the, intention, is, to, enable, relaxation, utility, above, all, else, was, an, objective, separation, applied, to, areas, designed, in, different, styles, and, different, uses, enhancing, safety, and, reducing, distraction, a, key, feature, of, central, park, is, the, use, of, sunken, roadways, which, traverse, the, park, and, are, specifically, dedicated, to, vehicles, as, opposed, to, the, winding, pathways, designated, specifically, for, pedestrians, an, example, of, this, mix, of, principles, is, seen, in, the, central, park, mall, a, large, promenade, leading, to, the, bethesda, terrace, and, the, single, formal, feature, in, olmsted, and, vaux, s, original, naturalistic, design, the, designers, wrote, that, a, grand, promenade, was, an, essential, feature, of, a, metropolitan, park, however, its, formal, symmetry, its, style, although, something, of, an, aberration, was, designed, to, be, subordinate, to, the, natural, view, surrounding, it, wealthy, passengers, were, let, from, their, carriages, at, its, south, end, the, carriage, would, then, drive, around, to, the, terrace, which, overlooked, the, lake, and, ramble, to, pick, them, up, saving, them, the, trouble, of, needing, to, double, back, on, foot, the, promenade, was, lined, with, slender, elms, and, offered, views, of, sheep, meadow, affluent, new, yorkers, who, rarely, walked, through, the, park, mixed, with, the, less, well, to, do, in, the, terrace, areas, and, all, enjoyed, an, escape, from, the, hustle, and, bustle, of, the, surrounding, city, however, the, most, wealthy, among, them, employed, the, firm, to, landscape, their, country, estates, in, a, similar, fashion, for, their, private, enjoyment, such, as, that, of, frederick, t, van, beuren, jr, in, new, jersey, he, is, a, descendant, of, a, dutch, physician, who, settled, in, manhattan, in, 1700, and, whose, family, members, became, prominent, property, owners, in, the, city, and, various, other, locations, initially, that, country, estate, was, one, of, several, self, sufficient, retreats, from, manhattan, held, by, the, family, that, included, a, supporting, farm, for, produce, livestock, and, a, livery, as, well, as, several, houses, for, permanent, staff, the, estate, later, became, a, more, permanent, residence, as, van, beuren, s, career, shifted, to, founding, a, hospital, in, the, growing, community, nearby, at, that, time, the, shingled, structure, in, new, vernon, was, renovated, into, a, brick, structure, that, is, described, as, one, of, the, notable, mansions, of, the, area, at, the, time, of, the, renovation, the, mature, landscape, plan, for, the, residence, was, not, altered, a, widening, of, spring, valley, road, during, the, late, twentieth, century, did, eliminate, some, olmsted, landscaping, that, included, a, cascading, bank, of, native, ferns, lining, a, roadside, stretch, of, the, property, that, extended, along, the, road, from, blackberry, lane, to, the, eponymous, van, beuren, road, that, divided, the, family, property, from, its, northern, boundary, to, its, southern, boundary, at, blue, mill, road
