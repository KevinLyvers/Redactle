williamsburg, climate, thought, to, be, more, likely, to, harbor, infectious, disease, might, have, impacted, his, health, instead, in, 1769, he, enrolled, at, the, college, of, new, jersey, later,

college, s, president, john, witherspoon, he, returned, home, to, montpelier, in, early, 1772, madison, s, ideas, on, philosophy, and, morality, were, strongly, shaped, by, witherspoon, who, converted, him, to, the, philosophy, values, and, modes, of, thinking, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, biographer, terence, ball, wrote, that, at, princeton, madison, was, immersed, in, the, liberalism, of, the, enlightenment, and, converted, to, eighteenth, century, political, radicalism, from, then, on, james, madison, s, theories, would, advance, the, rights, of, happiness, of, man, and, his, most, active, efforts, would, serve, devotedly, the, cause, of, civil, and, political, liberty, after, returning, to, montpelier, without, a, chosen, career, madison, tutored, his, younger, siblings, he, began, to, study, law, books, in, 1773, asking, his, friend, bradford, a, law, apprentice, to, send, him, a, plan, of, study, madison, had, acquired, an, understanding, of, legal, publications, by, 1783, he, saw, himself, as, a, law, student, but, not, a, lawyer, madison, did, not, apprentice, himself, to, a, lawyer, and, never, joined, the, bar, following, the, revolutionary, war, he, spent, time, at, montpelier, studying, ancient, democracies, in, preparation, for, the, constitutional, convention, madison, suffered, from, episodes, of, mental, exhaustion, and, illness, with, associated, nervousness, which, often, caused, short, term, incapacity, after, periods, of, stress, however, he, enjoyed, good, physical, health, until, his, final, years, in, 1765, the, british, parliament, passed, the, stamp, act, which, caused, strong, opposition, by, the, colonists, and, began, a, conflict, that, would, culminate, in, the, american, revolution, the, american, revolutionary, war, broke, out, on, april, 19, 1775, the, colonists, formed, three, prominent, factions, loyalists, who, continued, to, back, king, george, iii, of, the, united, kingdom, a, significant, neutral, faction, without, firm, commitments, to, either, loyalists, or, patriots, and, the, patriots, whom, madison, joined, under, the, leadership, of, the, continental, congress, madison, believed, that, parliament, had, overstepped, its, bounds, by, attempting, to, tax, the, american, colonies, and, he, sympathized, with, those, who, resisted, british, rule, historically, debate, about, the, consecration, of, bishops, was, ongoing, and, eventual, legislation, was, passed, in, the, british, parliament, subsequently, called, the, consecration, of, bishops, abroad, act, 1786, to, allow, bishops, to, be, consecrated, for, an, american, church, outside, of, allegiance, to, the, british, crown, the, new, anglican, churches, began, incorporating, more, active, forms, of, polity, in, their, own, self, government, collective, decision, making, and, self, supported, financing, these, measures, would, be, consistent, with, separation, of, religious, and, secular, identities, madison, believed, these, measures, to, be, insufficient, and, favored, disestablishing, the, anglican, church, in, virginia, madison, believed, that, tolerance, of, an, established, religion, was, detrimental, not, only, to, freedom, of, religion, but, also, because, it, encouraged, excessive, deference, to, any, authority, which, might, be, asserted, by, an, established, church, after, returning, to, montpelier, in, 1774, madison, took, a, seat, on, the, local, committee, of, safety, a, pro, revolution, group, that, oversaw, the, local, patriot, militia, in, october, 1775, he, was, commissioned, as, the, colonel, of, the, orange, county, militia, serving, as, his, father, s, second, in, command, until, he, was, elected, as, a, delegate, to, the, fifth, virginia, convention, which, was, charged, with, producing, virginia, s, first, constitution, although, madison, never, battled, in, the, revolutionary, war, he, rose, to, prominence, in, virginia, politics, as, a, wartime, leader, at, the, virginia, constitutional, convention, he, convinced, delegates, to, alter, the, virginia, declaration, of, rights, originally, drafted, on, may, 20, 1776, to, provide, for, equal, entitlement, rather, than, mere, tolerance, in, the, exercise, of, religion, with, the, enactment, of, the, virginia, constitution, madison, became, part, of, the, virginia, house, of, delegates, and, he, was, subsequently, elected, to, the, virginia, governor, s, council, of, state, where, he, became, a, close, ally, of, governor, thomas, jefferson, on, july, 4, 1776, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, was, formally, printed, madison, participated, in, the, debates, concerning, the, articles, of, confederation, in, november, 1777, contributing, to, the, discussion, of, religious, freedom, affecting, the, drafting, of, the, articles, though, his, signature, was, not, required, for, adopting, the, articles, of, confederation, madison, had, proposed, liberalizing, the, article, on, religious, freedom, but, the, larger, virginia, convention, stripped, the, proposed, constitution, of, the, more, radical, language, of, free, expression, of, faith, to, the, less, controversial, mention, of, highlighting, tolerance, within, religion, madison, again, served, on, the, council, of, state, from, 1777, to, 1779, when, he, was, elected, to, the, second, continental, congress, the, governing, body, of, the, united, states, during, madison, s, term, in, congress, from, 1780, to, 1783, the, u, s, faced, a, difficult, war, against, great, britain, as, well, as, runaway, inflation, financial, troubles, and, a, lack, of, cooperation, between, the, different, levels, of, government, according, to, historian, j, c, a, stagg, madison, worked, to, become, an, expert, on, financial, issues, becoming, a, legislative, workhorse, and, a, master, of, parliamentary, coalition, building, frustrated, by, the, failure, of, the, states, to, supply, needed, requisitions, madison, proposed, to, amend, the, articles, of, confederation, to, grant, congress, the, power, to, independently, raise, revenue, through, tariffs, on, imports, though, general, george, washington, congressman, alexander, hamilton, and, other, leaders, also, favored, the, tariff, amendment, it, failed, to, win, the, ratification, of, all, thirteen, states, while, a, member, of, congress, madison, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, a, close, alliance, between, the, united, states, and, france, as, an, advocate, of, westward, expansion, he, insisted, that, the, new, nation, had, to, ensure, its, right, to, navigation, on, the, mississippi, river, and, control, of, all, lands, east, of, it, in, the, treaty, of, paris, which, ended, the, revolutionary, war, following, his, term, in, congress, madison, won, election, to, the, virginia, house, of, delegates, in, 1784, as, a, member, of, the, virginia, house, of, delegates, madison, continued, to, advocate, for, religious, freedom, and, along, with, jefferson, drafted, the, virginia, statute, for, religious, freedom, that, amendment, which, guaranteed, freedom, of, religion, and, disestablished, the, church, of, england, was, passed, in, 1786, madison, also, became, a, land, speculator, purchasing, land, along, the, mohawk, river, in, partnership, with, another, jefferson, prot, g, james, monroe, throughout, the, 1780s, madison, became, increasingly, worried, about, the, disunity, of, the, states, and, the, weakness, of, the, central, government, he, believed, that, direct, democracy, caused, social, decay, and, that, a, republican, government, would, be, effective, against, partisanship, and, factionalism, he, was, particularly, troubled, by, laws, that, legalized, paper, money, and, denied, diplomatic, immunity, to, ambassadors, from, other, countries, madison, was, also, concerned, about, the, lack, of, ability, in, congress, to, capably, create, foreign, policy, protect, american, trade, and, foster, the, settlement, of, the, lands, between, the, appalachian, mountains, and, the, mississippi, river, as, madison, wrote, a, crisis, had, arrived, which, was, to, decide, whether, the, american, experiment, was, to, be, a, blessing, to, the, world, or, to, blast, for, ever, the, hopes, which, the, republican, cause, had, inspired, madison, committed, to, an, intense, study, of, law, and, political, theory, and, also, was, influenced, by, enlightenment, texts, sent, by, jefferson, from, france, madison, especially, sought, out, works, on, international, law, and, the, constitutions, of, ancient, and, modern, confederacies, such, as, the, dutch, republic, the, swiss, confederation, and, the, achaean, league, he, came, to, believe, that, the, united, states, could, improve, upon, past, republican, experiments, by, its, size, which, geographically, combined, 13, colonies, with, so, many, competing, interests, madison, hoped, to, minimize, the, abuses, of, majority, rule, additionally, navigation, rights, to, the, major, trade, routes, accessed, by, the, mississippi, river, highly, concerned, madison, he, opposed, the, proposal, by, john, jay, that, the, united, states, concede, claims, to, the, river, for, 25, years, and, according, to, historian, ralph, ketcham, madison, s, desire, to, fight, the, proposal, was, a, major, motivation, in, his, return, to, congress, in, 1787, leading, up, to, the, 1787, ratification, debates, for, the, constitution, madison, worked, with, other, members, of, the, virginia, delegation, especially, edmund, randolph, and, george, mason, to, create, and, present, the, virginia, plan, an, outline, for, a, new, federal, constitution, it, called, for, three, branches, of, government, legislative, executive, and, judicial, a, bicameral, congress, consisting, of, the, senate, and, the, house, of, representatives, apportioned, by, population, and, a, federal, council, of, revision, that, would, have, the, right, to, veto, laws, passed, by, congress, the, virginia, plan, did, not, explicitly, lay, out, the, structure, of, the, executive, branch, but, madison, himself, favored, a, strong, single, executive, many, delegates, were, surprised, to, learn, that, the, plan, called, for, the, abrogation, of, the, articles, and, the, creation, of, a, new, constitution, to, be, ratified, by, special, conventions, in, each, state, rather, than, by, the, state, legislatures, with, the, assent, of, prominent, attendees, such, as, washington, and, benjamin, franklin, the, delegates, agreed, in, a, secret, session, that, the, abrogation, of, the, articles, and, the, creation, of, a, new, constitution, was, a, plausible, option, and, began, scheduling, the, process, of, debating, its, ratification, in, the, individual, states, as, a, compromise, between, small, and, large, states, large, states, got, a, proportional, house, while, the, small, states, got, equal, representation, in, the, senate, after, the, philadelphia, convention, ended, in, september, 1787, madison, convinced, his, fellow, congressmen, to, remain, neutral, in, the, ratification, debate, and, allow, each, state, to, vote, on, the, constitution, those, who, supported, the, constitution, were, called, federalists, that, included, madison, opponents, of, the, constitution, known, as, anti, federalists, began, a, public, campaign, against, ratification, in, response, starting, in, october, 1787, hamilton, and, john, jay, both, federalists, began, publishing, a, series, of, pro, ratification, newspaper, articles, in, new, york, after, jay, dropped, out, of, the, project, hamilton, approached, madison, who, was, in, new, york, on, congressional, business, to, write, some, of, the, essays, the, essays, were, published, under, the, pseudonym, of, publius, the, trio, produced, 85, essays, known, as, the, federalist, papers, the, 85, essays, were, divided, into, two, parts, 36, letters, against, the, articles, of, confederation, and, 49, letters, that, favored, the, new, constitution, the, articles, were, also, published, in, book, form, and, used, by, the, supporters, of, the, constitution, in, the, ratifying, conventions, federalist, no, 10, madison, s, first, contribution, to, the, federalist, papers, became, highly, regarded, in, the, 20th, century, for, its, advocacy, of, representative, democracy, in, it, madison, describes, the, dangers, posed, by, the, majority, factions, and, argues, that, their, effects, can, be, limited, through, the, formation, of, a, large, republic, he, theorizes, that, in, large, republics, the, large, number, of, factions, that, emerge, will, control, their, influence, because, no, single, faction, can, become, a, majority, in, federalist, no, 51, he, explains, how, the, separation, of, powers, between, three, branches, of, the, federal, government, as, well, as, between, state, governments, and, the, federal, government, establishes, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, that, ensures, that, no, one, institution, would, become, too, powerful, as, the, virginia, ratification, convention, began, madison, focused, his, efforts, on, winning, the, support, of, the, relatively, small, number, of, undecided, delegates, his, long, correspondence, with, randolph, paid, off, at, the, convention, as, randolph, announced, that, he, would, support, unconditional, ratification, of, the, constitution, with, amendments, to, be, proposed, after, ratification, though, former, virginia, governor, patrick, henry, gave, several, persuasive, speeches, arguing, against, ratification, madison, s, expertise, on, the, subject, he, had, long, argued, for, allowed, him, to, respond, with, rational, arguments, to, henry, s, anti, federalist, appeals, madison, was, also, a, defender, of, federal, veto, rights, and, according, to, historian, ron, chernow, pleaded, at, the, constitutional, convention, that, the, federal, government, should, possess, a, veto, over, state, laws, in, his, final, speech, to, the, ratifying, convention, madison, implored, his, fellow, delegates, to, ratify, the, constitution, as, it, had, been, written, arguing, that, failure, to, do, so, would, lead, to, the, collapse, of, the, entire, ratification, effort, as, each, state, would, seek, favorable, amendments, on, june, 25, 1788, the, convention, voted, 89, 79, in, favor, of, ratification, the, vote, came, a, week, after, new, hampshire, became, the, ninth, state, to, ratify, thereby, securing, the, constitution, s, adoption, and, with, that, a, new, form, of, government, the, following, january, washington, was, elected, the, nation, s, first, president, after, virginia, ratified, the, constitution, madison, returned, to, new, york, and, resumed, his, duties, in, the, congress, of, the, confederation, after, madison, was, defeated, in, his, bid, for, the, senate, and, with, concerns, for, both, his, political, career, and, the, possibility, that, patrick, henry, and, his, allies, would, arrange, for, a, second, constitutional, convention, madison, ran, for, the, house, of, representatives, henry, and, the, anti, federalists, were, in, firm, control, of, the, general, assembly, in, the, autumn, of, 1788, at, henry, s, behest, the, virginia, legislature, designed, to, deny, madison, a, seat, by, gerrymandering, congressional, districts, henry, and, his, supporters, ensured, that, orange, county, was, in, a, district, heavily, populated, with, anti, federalists, roughly, three, to, one, to, oppose, madison, henry, also, recruited, james, monroe, a, strong, challenger, to, madison, locked, in, a, difficult, race, against, monroe, madison, promised, to, support, a, series, of, constitutional, amendments, to, protect, individual, liberties, in, an, open, letter, madison, wrote, that, while, he, had, opposed, requiring, alterations, to, the, constitution, before, ratification, he, now, believed, that, amendments, if, pursued, with, a, proper, moderation, and, in, a, proper, mode, may, serve, the, double, purpose, of, satisfying, the, minds, of, well, meaning, opponents, and, of, providing, additional, guards, in, favor, of, liberty, madison, s, promise, paid, off, as, in, virginia, s, 5th, district, election, he, gained, a, seat, in, congress, with, 57, percent, of, the, vote, madison, became, a, key, adviser, to, washington, who, valued, madison, s, understanding, of, the, constitution, madison, helped, washington, write, his, first, inaugural, address, and, also, prepared, the, official, house, response, to, washington, s, speech, he, played, a, significant, role, in, establishing, and, staffing, the, three, cabinet, departments, and, his, influence, helped, thomas, jefferson, become, the, first, secretary, of, state, at, the, start, of, the, first, congress, he, introduced, a, tariff, bill, similar, to, the, one, he, had, advocated, for, under, the, articles, of, the, confederation, and, congress, established, a, federal, tariff, on, imports, by, enacting, the, tariff, of, 1789, the, following, year, secretary, of, the, treasury, hamilton, introduced, an, ambitious, economic, program, that, called, for, the, federal, assumption, of, state, debts, and, the, funding, of, that, debt, through, the, issuance, of, federal, securities, hamilton, s, plan, favored, northern, speculators, and, was, disadvantageous, to, states, such, as, virginia, that, had, already, paid, off, most, of, their, debt, madison, emerged, as, one, of, the, principal, congressional, opponents, of, the, plan, after, prolonged, legislative, deadlock, madison, jefferson, and, hamilton, agreed, to, the, compromise, of, 1790, which, provided, for, the, enactment, of, hamilton, s, assumption, plan, as, part, of, the, funding, act, of, 1790, in, return, congress, passed, the, residence, act, which, established, the, federal, capital, district, of, washington, d, c, during, the, first, congress, madison, took, the, lead, in, advocating, for, several, constitutional, amendments, to, the, bill, of, rights, his, primary, goals, were, to, fulfill, his, 1789, campaign, pledge, and, to, prevent, the, calling, of, a, second, constitutional, convention, but, he, also, hoped, to, safeguard, the, rights, and, liberties, of, the, people, against, broad, actions, of, congress, and, individual, states, he, believed, that, the, enumeration, of, specific, rights, would, fix, those, rights, in, the, public, mind, and, encourage, judges, to, protect, them, after, studying, more, than, two, hundred, amendments, that, had, been, proposed, at, the, state, ratifying, conventions, madison, introduced, the, bill, of, rights, on, june, 8, 1789, his, amendments, contained, numerous, restrictions, on, the, federal, government, and, would, protect, among, other, things, freedom, of, religion, freedom, of, speech, and, the, right, to, peaceful, assembly, while, most, of, his, proposed, amendments, were, drawn, from, the, ratifying, conventions, madison, was, largely, responsible, for, proposals, to, guarantee, freedom, of, the, press, protect, property, from, government, seizure, and, ensure, jury, trials, he, also, proposed, an, amendment, to, prevent, states, from, abridging, equal, rights, of, conscience, or, freedom, of, the, press, or, the, trial, by, jury, in, criminal, cases, to, prevent, a, permanent, standing, federal, army, madison, proposed, the, second, amendment, which, gave, state, regulated, militia, groups, and, private, citizens, the, right, to, bear, arms, madison, and, the, republicans, desired, a, free, government, to, be, established, by, the, consent, of, the, governed, rather, than, by, national, military, force, madison, s, bill, of, rights, faced, little, opposition, he, had, largely, co, opted, the, anti, federalist, goal, of, amending, the, constitution, but, had, avoided, proposing, amendments, that, would, alienate, supporters, of, the, constitution, his, amendments, were, mostly, adopted, by, the, house, of, representatives, as, proposed, but, the, senate, made, several, changes, madison, s, proposal, to, apply, parts, of, the, bill, of, rights, to, the, states, was, eliminated, as, was, his, change, to, the, constitution, s, preamble, which, he, thought, would, be, enhanced, by, including, a, prefatory, paragraph, indicating, that, governmental, power, is, vested, by, the, people, he, was, disappointed, that, the, bill, of, rights, did, not, include, protections, against, actions, by, state, governments, but, the, passage, of, the, document, mollified, some, critics, of, the, original, constitution, and, shored, up, his, support, in, virginia, ten, amendments, were, finally, ratified, on, december, 15, 1791, becoming, known, in, their, final, form, as, the, bill, of, rights, after, 1790, the, washington, administration, became, polarized, into, two, main, factions, one, faction, led, by, jefferson, and, madison, broadly, represented, southern, interests, and, sought, close, relations, with, france, this, faction, became, the, democratic, republican, party, opposition, to, secretary, of, the, treasury, hamilton, the, other, faction, led, by, hamilton, and, the, federalists, broadly, represented, northern, financial, interests, and, favored, close, relations, with, britain, in, 1791, hamilton, introduced, a, plan, that, called, for, the, establishment, of, a, national, bank, to, provide, loans, to, emerging, industries, and, oversee, the, money, supply, madison, and, the, democratic, republican, party, fought, back, against, hamilton, s, attempt, to, expand, the, power, of, the, federal, government, with, the, formation, of, a, national, bank, madison, argued, that, under, the, constitution, congress, did, not, have, the, power, to, create, a, federally, empowered, national, bank, despite, madison, s, opposition, congress, passed, a, bill, to, create, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, which, washington, signed, into, law, in, february, 1791, as, hamilton, implemented, his, economic, program, and, washington, continued, to, enjoy, immense, prestige, as, president, madison, became, increasingly, concerned, that, hamilton, would, seek, to, abolish, the, federal, republic, in, favor, of, a, centralized, monarchy, when, hamilton, submitted, his, report, on, manufactures, which, called, for, federal, action, to, stimulate, the, development, of, a, diversified, economy, madison, once, again, challenged, hamilton, s, proposal, along, with, jefferson, madison, helped, philip, freneau, establish, the, national, gazette, a, philadelphia, newspaper, that, attacked, hamilton, s, proposals, in, an, essay, in, the, newspaper, in, september, 1792, madison, wrote, that, the, country, had, divided, into, two, factions, his, faction, which, believed, that, mankind, are, capable, of, governing, themselves, and, hamilton, s, faction, which, allegedly, sought, the, establishment, of, an, aristocratic, monarchy, and, was, biased, in, favor, of, the, wealthy, those, opposed, to, hamilton, s, economic, policies, including, many, former, anti, federalists, continued, to, strengthen, the, ranks, of, the, democratic, republican, party, while, those, who, supported, the, administration, s, policies, supported, hamilton, s, federalist, party, in, the, 1792, presidential, election, both, major, parties, supported, washington, for, re, election, but, the, democratic, republicans, sought, to, unseat, vice, president, john, adams, because, the, constitution, s, rules, essentially, precluded, jefferson, from, challenging, adams, the, party, backed, new, york, governor, george, clinton, for, the, vice, presidency, but, adams, won, nonetheless, with, jefferson, out, of, office, after, 1793, madison, became, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, democratic, republican, party, when, britain, and, france, went, to, war, in, 1793, the, u, s, needed, to, determine, which, side, to, support, while, the, differences, between, the, democratic, republicans, and, the, federalists, had, previously, centered, on, economic, matters, foreign, policy, became, an, increasingly, important, issue, as, madison, and, jefferson, favored, france, and, hamilton, favored, britain, war, with, britain, became, imminent, in, 1794, after, the, british, seized, hundreds, of, american, ships, that, were, trading, with, french, colonies, madison, believed, that, a, trade, war, with, britain, would, probably, succeed, and, would, allow, americans, to, assert, their, independence, fully, the, british, west, indies, madison, maintained, could, not, live, without, american, foodstuffs, but, americans, could, easily, do, without, british, manufacturers, similarly, madison, argued, that, british, industry, was, highly, dependent, on, the, demand, of, american, consumers, and, would, suffer, heavily, if, this, market, was, denied, to, the, british, washington, secured, friendly, trade, relations, with, britain, through, the, jay, treaty, of, 1794, madison, and, his, democratic, republican, allies, were, outraged, by, the, treaty, the, democratic, republican, robert, r, livingston, wrote, to, madison, that, the, treaty, sacrifices, every, essential, interest, and, prostrates, the, honor, of, our, country, madison, s, strong, opposition, to, the, treaty, led, to, a, permanent, break, with, washington, ending, their, friendship, on, september, 15, 1794, madison, married, dolley, payne, todd, the, 26, year, old, widow, of, john, todd, a, quaker, farmer, who, died, during, a, yellow, fever, epidemic, earlier, that, year, madison, and, dolley, todd, had, been, formally, introduced, at, madison, s, request, by, aaron, burr, burr, had, become, friends, with, her, when, staying, at, the, same, philadelphia, boardinghouse, the, two, quickly, became, romantically, engaged, and, prepared, for, a, wedding, that, summer, but, todd, suffered, recurring, illnesses, because, of, her, exposure, to, yellow, fever, in, philadelphia, they, eventually, traveled, to, harewood, in, virginia, for, their, wedding, only, a, few, close, family, members, attended, and, winchester, reverend, alexander, balmain, presided, dolley, became, a, renowned, figure, in, washington, d, c, and, excelled, at, hosting, she, subsequently, helped, to, establish, the, modern, image, of, the, first, lady, of, the, united, states, as, an, individual, who, has, a, leading, role, in, the, social, affairs, of, the, nation, throughout, his, life, madison, maintained, a, close, relationship, with, his, father, james, sr, at, age, 50, madison, inherited, the, large, plantation, of, montpelier, and, other, possessions, including, his, father, s, slaves, while, madison, never, had, children, with, dolley, he, adopted, her, one, surviving, son, john, payne, todd, known, as, payne, after, the, couple, s, marriage, some, of, his, colleagues, such, as, monroe, and, burr, believed, madison, s, lack, of, offspring, weighed, on, his, thoughts, though, he, never, spoke, of, any, distress, oral, history, has, suggested, madison, may, have, fathered, a, child, with, his, enslaved, half, sister, a, cook, named, coreen, but, researchers, were, unable, to, gather, the, dna, evidence, needed, to, determine, the, validity, of, the, accusation, washington, chose, to, retire, after, serving, two, terms, and, in, advance, of, the, 1796, presidential, election, madison, helped, convince, jefferson, to, run, for, the, presidency, despite, madison, s, efforts, federalist, candidate, john, adams, defeated, jefferson, taking, a, narrow, majority, of, the, electoral, vote, under, the, rules, of, the, electoral, college, then, in, place, jefferson, became, vice, president, because, he, finished, with, the, second, most, electoral, votes, madison, meanwhile, had, declined, to, seek, re, election, to, the, house, and, he, returned, to, montpelier, on, jefferson, s, advice, adams, considered, appointing, madison, to, an, american, delegation, charged, with, ending, french, attacks, on, american, shipping, but, adams, s, cabinet, members, strongly, opposed, the, idea, though, he, was, out, of, office, madison, remained, a, prominent, democratic, republican, leader, in, opposition, to, the, adams, administration, madison, and, jefferson, believed, that, the, federalists, were, using, the, quasi, war, with, france, to, justify, the, violation, of, constitutional, rights, by, passing, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, and, they, increasingly, came, to, view, adams, as, a, monarchist, both, madison, and, jefferson, expressed, the, belief, that, natural, rights, were, non, negotiable, even, in, war, madison, believed, that, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, formed, a, dangerous, precedent, by, giving, the, government, the, power, to, look, past, the, natural, rights, of, its, people, in, the, name, of, national, security, in, response, to, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, jefferson, argued, that, the, states, had, the, power, to, nullify, federal, law, on, the, basis, of, the, constitution, being, a, compact, among, the, states, madison, rejected, this, view, of, nullification, and, urged, that, states, respond, to, unjust, federal, laws, through, interposition, a, process, by, which, a, state, legislature, declared, a, law, to, be, unconstitutional, but, did, not, take, steps, to, actively, prevent, its, enforcement, jefferson, s, doctrine, of, nullification, was, widely, rejected, and, the, incident, damaged, the, democratic, republican, party, as, attention, was, shifted, from, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, to, the, unpopular, nullification, doctrine, in, 1799, madison, was, elected, to, the, virginia, legislature, at, the, same, time, madison, planned, for, jefferson, s, campaign, in, the, 1800, presidential, election, madison, issued, the, report, of, 1800, which, attacked, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, as, unconstitutional, that, report, held, that, congress, was, limited, to, legislating, on, its, enumerated, powers, and, that, punishment, for, sedition, violated, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, the, press, jefferson, embraced, the, report, and, it, became, the, unofficial, democratic, republican, platform, for, the, 1800, election, with, the, federalists, divided, between, supporters, of, hamilton, and, adams, and, with, news, of, the, end, of, the, quasi, war, not, reaching, the, united, states, until, after, the, election, jefferson, and, his, running, mate, aaron, burr, defeated, adams, madison, was, one, of, two, major, influences, in, jefferson, s, cabinet, the, other, being, secretary, of, the, treasury, albert, gallatin, madison, was, appointed, secretary, of, state, despite, lacking, foreign, policy, experience, an, introspective, individual, he, received, assistance, from, his, wife, relying, deeply, on, her, in, dealing, with, the, social, pressures, of, being, a, public, figure, both, in, his, own, cabinet, appointment, as, secretary, of, state, and, afterward, as, the, ascent, of, napoleon, in, france, had, dulled, democratic, republican, enthusiasm, for, the, french, cause, madison, sought, a, neutral, position, in, the, ongoing, coalition, wars, between, france, and, britain, domestically, the, jefferson, administration, and, the, democratic, republican, congress, rolled, back, many, federalist, policies, congress, quickly, repealed, the, alien, and, sedition, act, abolished, internal, taxes, and, reduced, the, size, of, the, army, and, navy, gallatin, however, convinced, jefferson, to, retain, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, though, the, federalist, political, power, was, rapidly, fading, at, the, national, level, chief, justice, john, marshall, ensured, that, federalist, ideology, retained, an, important, presence, in, the, judiciary, in, the, case, of, marbury, v, madison, marshall, simultaneously, ruled, that, madison, had, unjustly, refused, to, deliver, federal, commissions, to, individuals, who, had, been, appointed, by, the, previous, administration, but, that, the, supreme, court, did, not, have, jurisdiction, over, the, case, most, importantly, marshall, s, opinion, established, the, principle, of, judicial, review, jefferson, was, sympathetic, to, the, westward, expansion, of, americans, who, had, settled, as, far, west, as, the, mississippi, river, supported, by, his, concern, for, the, sparse, regional, demographics, in, the, far, west, compared, to, the, more, populated, eastern, states, the, far, west, being, inhabited, almost, exclusively, by, native, americans, jefferson, promoted, such, western, expansion, and, hoped, to, acquire, the, spanish, territory, of, louisiana, west, of, the, mississippi, river, for, expansionist, purposes, early, in, jefferson, s, presidency, the, administration, learned, that, spain, planned, to, retrocede, the, louisiana, territory, to, france, raising, fears, of, french, encroachment, on, u, s, territory, in, 1802, jefferson, and, madison, sent, monroe, to, france, to, negotiate, the, purchase, of, new, orleans, which, controlled, access, to, the, mississippi, river, and, thus, was, immensely, important, to, the, farmers, of, the, american, frontier, rather, than, merely, selling, new, orleans, napoleon, s, government, offered, to, sell, the, entire, territory, of, louisiana, despite, lacking, explicit, authorization, from, jefferson, monroe, along, with, livingston, whom, jefferson, had, appointed, as, america, s, minister, to, france, negotiated, the, louisiana, purchase, in, which, france, sold, more, than, 827, 987, square, miles, 2, 144, 480, square, kilometers, of, land, in, exchange, for, 15, million, equivalent, to, 271, 433, 333, 33, in, 2021, despite, the, time, sensitive, nature, of, negotiations, with, the, french, jefferson, was, concerned, about, the, constitutionality, of, the, louisiana, purchase, and, he, privately, favored, introducing, a, constitutional, amendment, explicitly, authorizing, congress, to, acquire, new, territories, madison, convinced, jefferson, to, refrain, from, proposing, the, amendment, and, the, administration, ultimately, submitted, the, louisiana, purchase, treaty, for, approval, by, the, senate, without, an, accompanying, constitutional, amendment, unlike, jefferson, madison, was, not, seriously, concerned, with, the, constitutionality, of, the, purchase, he, believed, that, the, circumstances, did, not, warrant, a, strict, interpretation, of, the, constitution, because, the, expansion, was, in, the, country, s, best, interest, the, senate, quickly, ratified, the, treaty, and, the, house, with, equal, alacrity, passed, enabling, legislation, early, in, his, tenure, jefferson, was, able, to, maintain, cordial, relations, with, both, france, and, britain, but, relations, with, britain, deteriorated, after, 1805, the, british, ended, their, policy, of, tolerance, towards, american, shipping, and, began, seizing, american, goods, headed, for, french, ports, they, also, impressed, american, sailors, some, of, whom, had, originally, defected, from, the, british, navy, but, some, of, whom, had, never, been, british, subjects, in, response, to, the, attacks, congress, passed, the, non, importation, act, which, restricted, many, but, not, all, british, imports, tensions, with, britain, were, heightened, due, to, the, chesapeake, leopard, affair, a, june, 1807, naval, confrontation, between, american, and, british, naval, forces, while, the, french, also, began, attacking, american, shipping, madison, believed, that, economic, pressure, could, force, the, british, to, end, their, seizure, of, american, shipped, goods, and, he, and, jefferson, convinced, congress, to, pass, the, embargo, act, of, 1807, which, banned, all, exports, to, foreign, nations, the, embargo, proved, ineffective, unpopular, and, difficult, to, enforce, especially, in, new, england, in, march, 1809, congress, replaced, the, embargo, with, the, non, intercourse, act, which, allowed, trade, with, nations, other, than, britain, and, france, speculation, regarding, madison, s, potential, succession, to, jefferson, commenced, early, in, jefferson, s, first, term, madison, s, status, in, the, party, was, damaged, by, his, association, with, the, embargo, which, was, unpopular, throughout, the, country, and, especially, in, the, northeast, with, the, federalists, collapsing, as, a, national, party, after, 1800, the, chief, opposition, to, madison, s, candidacy, came, from, other, members, of, the, democratic, republican, party, madison, became, the, target, of, attacks, from, congressman, john, randolph, a, leader, of, a, faction, of, the, party, known, as, the, tertium, quids, randolph, recruited, monroe, who, had, felt, betrayed, by, the, administration, s, rejection, of, the, proposed, monroe, pinkney, treaty, with, britain, to, challenge, madison, for, leadership, of, the, party, many, northerners, meanwhile, hoped, that, vice, president, clinton, could, unseat, madison, as, jefferson, s, successor, despite, this, opposition, madison, won, his, party, s, presidential, nomination, at, the, january, 1808, congressional, nominating, caucus, the, federalist, party, mustered, little, strength, outside, new, england, and, madison, easily, defeated, federalist, candidate, charles, cotesworth, pinckney, in, the, general, election, madison, s, inauguration, took, place, on, march, 4, 1809, in, the, house, chamber, of, the, u, s, capitol, chief, justice, marshall, administered, the, presidential, oath, of, office, to, madison, while, outgoing, president, jefferson, watched, vice, president, george, clinton, was, sworn, in, for, a, second, term, making, him, the, first, u, s, vice, president, to, serve, under, two, presidents, unlike, jefferson, who, enjoyed, relatively, unified, support, madison, faced, political, opposition, from, previous, political, allies, such, as, monroe, and, clinton, additionally, the, federalist, party, was, resurgent, owing, to, opposition, to, the, embargo, aside, from, his, planned, nomination, of, gallatin, for, secretary, of, state, the, remaining, members, of, madison, s, cabinet, were, chosen, merely, to, further, political, harmony, and, according, to, historians, ketcham, and, rutland, were, largely, unremarkable, or, incompetent, due, to, the, opposition, of, monroe, and, clinton, madison, immediately, faced, opposition, to, his, planned, nomination, of, secretary, of, the, treasury, gallatin, as, secretary, of, state, madison, eventually, chose, not, to, nominate, gallatin, keeping, him, in, the, treasury, department, madison, settled, instead, for, robert, smith, to, be, the, secretary, of, state, however, for, the, next, two, years, madison, performed, most, of, the, job, of, the, secretary, of, state, due, to, smith, s, incompetence, after, bitter, intra, party, contention, madison, finally, replaced, smith, with, monroe, in, april, 1811, with, a, cabinet, full, of, those, he, distrusted, madison, rarely, called, cabinet, meetings, and, instead, frequently, consulted, with, gallatin, alone, early, in, his, presidency, madison, sought, to, continue, jefferson, s, policies, of, low, taxes, and, a, reduction, of, the, national, debt, in, 1811, congress, allowed, the, charter, of, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, to, lapse, after, madison, declined, to, take, a, strong, stance, on, the, issue, congress, had, repealed, the, embargo, act, of, 1807, shortly, before, madison, became, president, but, troubles, with, the, british, and, french, continued, madison, settled, on, a, new, strategy, that, was, designed, to, pit, the, british, and, french, against, each, other, offering, to, trade, with, whichever, country, would, end, their, attacks, against, american, shipping, the, gambit, almost, succeeded, but, negotiations, with, the, british, collapsed, in, mid, 1809, seeking, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, americans, and, the, british, napoleon, offered, to, end, french, attacks, on, american, shipping, so, long, as, the, united, states, punished, any, countries, that, did, not, similarly, end, restrictions, on, trade, madison, accepted, napoleon, s, proposal, in, the, hope, that, it, would, convince, the, british, to, finally, end, their, policy, of, commercial, warfare, notwithstanding, the, british, refused, to, change, their, policies, and, the, french, reneged, on, their, promise, and, continued, to, attack, american, shipping, with, sanctions, and, other, policies, having, failed, madison, determined, that, war, with, britain, was, the, only, remaining, option, many, americans, called, for, a, second, war, of, independence, to, restore, honor, and, stature, to, their, new, nation, and, an, angry, public, elected, a, war, hawk, congress, led, by, henry, clay, and, john, c, calhoun, with, britain, already, engaged, in, the, napoleonic, wars, many, americans, including, madison, believed, that, the, united, states, could, easily, capture, canada, using, it, as, a, bargaining, chip, for, other, disputes, or, simply, retaining, control, of, it, on, june, 1, 1812, madison, asked, congress, for, a, declaration, of, war, stating, that, the, united, states, could, no, longer, tolerate, britain, s, state, of, war, against, the, united, states, the, declaration, of, war, was, passed, along, sectional, and, party, lines, with, opposition, to, the, declaration, coming, from, federalists, and, from, some, democratic, republicans, in, the, northeast, in, the, years, prior, to, the, war, jefferson, and, madison, had, reduced, the, size, of, the, military, leaving, the, country, with, a, military, force, consisting, mostly, of, poorly, trained, militia, members, madison, asked, congress, to, quickly, put, the, country, into, an, armor, and, an, attitude, demanded, by, the, crisis, specifically, recommending, expansion, of, the, army, and, navy, given, the, circumstances, involving, napoleon, in, europe, madison, initially, believed, the, war, would, result, in, a, quick, american, victory, madison, ordered, three, landed, military, spearhead, incursions, into, canada, starting, from, fort, detroit, designed, to, loosen, british, control, around, american, held, fort, niagara, and, destroy, the, british, supply, lines, from, montreal, these, actions, would, gain, leverage, for, concessions, to, protect, american, shipping, in, the, atlantic, without, a, standing, army, madison, counted, on, regular, state, militias, to, rally, to, the, flag, and, invade, canada, still, governors, in, the, northeast, failed, to, cooperate, the, british, army, was, more, organized, used, professional, soldiers, and, fostered, an, alliance, with, native, american, tribes, led, by, tecumseh, on, august, 16, during, the, british, siege, of, detroit, major, general, william, hull, panicked, after, the, british, fired, on, the, fort, killing, two, american, officers, terrified, of, an, indian, attack, drinking, heavily, hull, quickly, ordered, a, white, tablecloth, out, a, window, and, unconditionally, surrendered, fort, detroit, and, his, entire, army, to, british, major, general, sir, issac, brock, hull, was, court, martialed, for, cowardice, but, madison, intervened, and, saved, him, from, being, shot, on, october, 13, a, separate, force, from, the, united, states, was, defeated, at, queenston, heights, although, brock, was, killed, commanding, general, henry, dearborn, hampered, by, mutinous, new, england, infantry, retreated, to, winter, quarters, near, albany, failing, to, destroy, montreal, s, vulnerable, british, supply, lines, lacking, adequate, revenue, to, fund, the, war, the, madison, administration, was, forced, to, rely, on, high, interest, loans, furnished, by, bankers, in, new, york, city, and, philadelphia, in, the, 1812, presidential, election, held, during, the, early, stages, of, the, war, madison, was, re, nominated, without, opposition, a, dissident, group, of, new, york, democratic, republicans, nominated, dewitt, clinton, the, lieutenant, governor, of, new, york, and, a, nephew, of, recently, deceased, vice, president, george, clinton, to, oppose, madison, in, the, 1812, election, this, faction, of, democratic, republicans, hoped, to, unseat, the, president, by, forging, a, coalition, among, democratic, republicans, opposed, to, the, coming, war, as, well, as, those, party, faithful, angry, with, madison, for, not, moving, more, decisively, toward, war, northerners, weary, of, the, virginia, dynasty, and, southern, control, of, the, white, house, and, many, new, englanders, wanted, madison, replaced, dismayed, about, their, prospects, of, beating, madison, a, group, of, top, federalists, met, with, clinton, s, supporters, to, discuss, a, unification, strategy, difficult, as, it, was, for, them, to, join, forces, they, nominated, clinton, for, president, and, jared, ingersoll, a, philadelphia, lawyer, for, vice, president, hoping, to, shore, up, his, support, in, the, northeast, where, the, war, of, 1812, was, unpopular, madison, selected, governor, elbridge, gerry, of, massachusetts, as, his, running, mate, though, gerry, would, only, survive, two, years, after, the, election, due, to, old, age, despite, the, maneuverings, of, clinton, and, the, federalists, madison, won, re, election, though, by, the, narrowest, margin, of, any, election, since, that, of, 1800, in, the, popular, vote, as, later, supported, by, the, electoral, vote, as, well, he, received, 128, electoral, votes, to, 89, for, clinton, with, clinton, winning, most, of, the, northeast, madison, won, pennsylvania, in, addition, to, having, swept, the, south, and, the, west, which, ensured, his, victory, after, the, disastrous, start, to, the, war, madison, accepted, russia, s, invitation, to, arbitrate, and, sent, a, delegation, led, by, gallatin, and, john, quincy, adams, the, son, of, former, president, john, adams, to, europe, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, while, madison, worked, to, end, the, war, the, united, states, experienced, some, impressive, naval, successes, by, the, uss, constitution, and, other, warships, that, boosted, american, morale, victorious, in, the, battle, of, lake, erie, the, u, s, crippled, the, supply, and, reinforcement, of, british, military, forces, in, the, western, theater, of, the, war, general, william, henry, harrison, defeated, the, forces, of, the, british, and, of, tecumseh, s, confederacy, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, the, death, of, tecumseh, in, that, battle, marked, the, permanent, end, of, armed, native, american, resistance, in, the, old, northwest, and, any, hope, of, a, united, indian, nation, in, march, 1814, major, general, andrew, jackson, broke, the, resistance, of, the, british, allied, muscogee, creek, in, the, old, southwest, with, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, despite, those, successes, the, british, continued, to, repel, american, attempts, to, invade, canada, and, a, british, force, captured, fort, niagara, and, burned, the, american, city, of, buffalo, in, late, 1813, on, august, 24, 1814, the, british, landed, a, large, force, on, the, shores, of, chesapeake, bay, and, routed, general, william, winder, s, army, at, the, battle, of, bladensburg, madison, who, had, earlier, inspected, winder, s, army, escaped, british, capture, by, fleeing, to, virginia, though, the, british, captured, washington, and, burned, many, of, its, buildings, including, the, white, house, dolley, had, abandoned, the, capital, and, fled, to, virginia, but, only, after, securing, the, portrait, of, george, washington, the, charred, remains, of, the, capital, signified, a, humiliating, defeat, for, james, madison, and, america, on, august, 27, madison, returned, to, washington, to, view, the, carnage, of, the, city, dolley, returned, the, next, day, and, on, september, 8, the, madisons, moved, into, the, octagon, house, the, british, army, next, advanced, on, baltimore, but, the, u, s, repelled, the, british, attack, in, the, battle, of, baltimore, and, the, british, army, departed, from, the, chesapeake, region, in, september, that, same, month, u, s, forces, repelled, a, british, invasion, from, canada, with, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, plattsburgh, the, british, public, began, to, turn, against, the, war, in, north, america, and, british, leaders, began, to, look, for, a, quick, exit, from, the, conflict, in, january, 1815, jackson, s, troops, defeated, the, british, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, just, more, than, a, month, later, madison, learned, that, his, negotiators, had, concluded, the, treaty, of, ghent, on, december, 24, 1814, which, ended, the, war, madison, quickly, sent, the, treaty, to, the, senate, which, ratified, it, on, february, 16, 1815, although, the, overall, result, of, the, war, ended, in, a, standoff, the, quick, succession, of, events, at, the, end, of, the, war, including, the, burning, of, the, capital, the, battle, of, new, orleans, and, the, treaty, of, ghent, made, it, appear, as, though, american, valor, at, new, orleans, had, forced, the, british, to, surrender, this, view, while, inaccurate, strongly, contributed, to, bolstering, madison, s, reputation, as, president, napoleon, s, defeat, at, the, june, 1815, battle, of, waterloo, brought, a, final, close, to, the, napoleonic, wars, and, thus, an, end, to, the, hostile, seizure, of, american, shipping, by, british, and, french, forces, the, postwar, period, of, madison, s, second, term, saw, the, transition, into, the, era, of, good, feelings, between, mid, 1815, and, 1817, with, the, federalists, experiencing, a, further, decline, in, influence, during, the, war, delegates, from, the, new, england, states, held, the, hartford, convention, where, they, asked, for, several, amendments, to, the, constitution, though, the, hartford, convention, did, not, explicitly, call, for, the, secession, of, new, england, the, convention, became, an, adverse, political, millstone, around, the, federalist, party, as, general, american, sentiment, had, moved, towards, a, celebrated, unity, among, the, states, in, what, they, saw, as, a, successful, second, war, of, independence, from, britain, madison, hastened, the, decline, of, the, federalists, by, adopting, several, programs, he, had, previously, opposed, recognizing, the, difficulties, of, financing, the, war, and, the, necessity, of, an, institution, to, regulate, american, currency, madison, proposed, the, re, establishment, of, a, national, bank, he, also, called, for, increased, spending, on, the, army, and, the, navy, a, tariff, designed, to, protect, american, goods, from, foreign, competition, and, a, constitutional, amendment, authorizing, the, federal, government, to, fund, the, construction, of, internal, improvements, such, as, roads, and, canals, madison, s, initiatives, to, now, act, on, behalf, of, a, national, bank, appeared, to, reverse, his, earlier, opposition, to, hamilton, and, were, opposed, by, strict, constructionists, such, as, john, randolph, who, stated, that, madison, s, proposals, now, out, hamiltons, alexander, hamilton, responding, to, madison, s, proposals, the, 14th, congress, compiled, one, of, the, most, productive, legislative, records, up, to, that, point, in, history, congress, granted, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, a, twenty, five, year, charter, and, passed, the, tariff, of, 1816, which, set, high, import, duties, for, all, goods, that, were, produced, outside, the, united, states, madison, approved, federal, spending, on, the, cumberland, road, which, provided, a, link, to, the, country, s, western, lands, still, in, his, last, act, before, leaving, office, he, blocked, further, federal, spending, on, internal, improvements, by, vetoing, the, bonus, bill, of, 1817, arguing, that, it, unduly, exceeded, the, limits, of, the, general, welfare, clause, concerning, such, improvements, upon, becoming, president, madison, said, the, federal, government, s, duty, was, to, convert, native, americans, by, the, participation, of, the, improvements, of, which, the, human, mind, and, manners, are, susceptible, in, a, civilized, state, in, 1809, general, harrison, began, to, push, for, a, treaty, to, open, more, land, for, white, american, settlement, the, miami, wea, and, kickapoo, were, vehemently, opposed, to, selling, any, more, land, around, the, wabash, river, harrison, decided, against, the, wishes, of, madison, to, first, conclude, a, treaty, with, the, tribes, who, were, willing, to, sell, and, use, those, treaties, to, help, influence, those, who, held, out, in, september, 1809, harrison, invited, the, potawatomie, delaware, eel, rivers, and, miami, to, a, meeting, in, fort, wayne, harrison, promised, large, subsidies, and, direct, payments, to, the, tribes, if, they, would, cede, the, other, lands, under, discussion, on, september, 30, 1809, madison, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, fort, wayne, negotiated, and, signed, by, indiana, territory, s, governor, harrison, in, the, treaty, the, american, indian, tribes, were, compensated, 5, 200, equivalent, to, 90, 092, 77, in, 2021, in, goods, and, 500, in, cash, equivalent, to, 8, 662, 77, in, 2021, with, 250, in, annual, payments, equivalent, to, 4, 331, 38, in, 2021, in, return, for, the, cession, of, 3, million, acres, of, land, approximately, 12, 140, square, kilometers, with, incentivized, subsidies, paid, to, individual, tribes, for, exerting, their, influence, over, less, cooperative, tribes, the, treaty, angered, shawnee, leader, tecumseh, who, said, sell, a, country, why, not, sell, the, air, the, clouds, and, the, great, sea, as, well, as, the, earth, like, jefferson, madison, had, a, paternalistic, attitude, toward, american, indians, encouraging, them, to, become, farmers, madison, believed, the, adoption, of, european, style, agriculture, would, help, native, americans, assimilate, the, values, of, british, u, s, civilization, as, pioneers, and, settlers, moved, west, into, large, tracts, of, cherokee, choctaw, creek, and, chickasaw, territory, madison, ordered, the, u, s, army, to, protect, native, lands, from, intrusion, by, settlers, this, was, done, to, the, chagrin, of, his, military, commander, andrew, jackson, who, wanted, madison, to, ignore, indian, pleas, to, stop, the, invasion, of, their, lands, tensions, continued, to, mount, between, the, united, states, and, tecumseh, over, the, 1809, treaty, of, fort, wayne, which, ultimately, led, to, tecumseh, s, alliance, with, the, british, and, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, on, november, 7, 1811, in, the, northwest, territory, the, divisions, among, the, native, american, leaders, were, bitter, and, before, leaving, the, discussions, tecumseh, informed, harrison, that, unless, the, terms, of, the, negotiated, treaty, were, largely, nullified, he, would, seek, an, alliance, with, the, british, the, situation, continued, to, escalate, eventually, leading, to, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, between, tecumseh, s, followers, and, american, settlers, later, that, year, tensions, continued, to, rise, leading, to, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, during, a, period, sometimes, called, tecumseh, s, war, tecumseh, was, defeated, and, indians, were, pushed, off, their, tribal, lands, replaced, entirely, by, white, settlers, in, addition, to, the, battle, of, the, thames, and, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, other, wars, with, american, indians, included, the, peoria, war, and, the, creek, war, negotiated, by, jackson, in, the, aftermath, of, the, creek, war, the, treaty, of, fort, jackson, of, august, 9, 1814, added, approximately, 23, million, acres, of, land, 93, 000, square, kilometers, to, georgia, and, alabama, privately, madison, did, not, believe, american, indians, could, be, fully, assimilated, to, the, values, of, euro, american, culture, and, may, have, been, unwilling, to, make, the, transition, from, the, hunter, or, even, the, herdsman, state, to, the, agriculture, madison, feared, that, native, americans, had, too, great, an, influence, on, the, settlers, they, interacted, with, who, in, his, view, was, irresistibly, attracted, by, that, complete, liberty, that, freedom, from, bonds, obligations, duties, that, absence, of, care, and, anxiety, which, characterize, the, savage, state, in, march, 1816, madison, s, secretary, of, war, william, crawford, advocated, for, the, government, to, encourage, intermarriages, between, native, americans, and, whites, as, a, way, of, assimilating, the, former, this, prompted, public, outrage, and, exacerbated, anti, indigenous, bigotry, among, white, americans, as, seen, in, hostile, letters, sent, to, madison, who, remained, publicly, silent, on, the, issue, in, the, 1816, presidential, election, madison, and, jefferson, both, favored, the, candidacy, of, secretary, of, state, james, monroe, who, defeated, secretary, of, war, william, h, crawford, in, the, party, s, congressional, nominating, caucus, as, the, federalist, party, continued, to, collapse, monroe, easily, defeated, federalist, candidate, new, york, senator, rufus, king, in, the, 1816, election, madison, left, office, as, a, popular, president, former, president, adams, wrote, that, madison, had, acquired, more, glory, and, established, more, union, than, all, his, three, predecessors, washington, adams, and, jefferson, put, together, when, madison, left, office, in, 1817, at, age, 65, he, retired, to, montpelier, as, with, both, washington, and, jefferson, madison, left, the, presidency, poorer, than, when, he, came, in, his, plantation, experienced, a, steady, financial, collapse, due, to, price, declines, in, tobacco, and, his, stepson, s, mismanagement, in, his, retirement, madison, occasionally, became, involved, in, public, affairs, advising, andrew, jackson, and, other, presidents, he, remained, out, of, the, public, debate, over, the, missouri, compromise, though, he, privately, complained, about, the, north, s, opposition, to, the, extension, of, slavery, madison, had, warm, relations, with, all, four, of, the, major, candidates, in, the, 1824, presidential, election, but, like, jefferson, largely, stayed, out, of, the, race, during, jackson, s, presidency, madison, publicly, disavowed, the, nullification, movement, and, argued, that, no, state, had, the, right, to, secede, madison, also, helped, jefferson, establish, the, university, of, virginia, in, 1826, after, the, death, of, jefferson, madison, was, appointed, as, the, second, rector, of, the, university, he, retained, the, position, as, college, chancellor, for, ten, years, until, his, death, in, 1836, in, 1829, at, the, age, of, 78, madison, was, chosen, as, a, representative, to, the, virginia, constitutional, convention, for, revision, of, the, commonwealth, s, constitution, it, was, his, last, appearance, as, a, statesman, apportionment, of, adequate, representation, was, the, central, issue, at, the, convention, for, the, western, districts, of, virginia, the, increased, population, in, the, piedmont, and, western, parts, of, the, state, were, not, proportionately, represented, in, the, legislature, western, reformers, also, wanted, to, extend, suffrage, to, all, white, men, in, place, of, the, prevailing, property, ownership, requirement, madison, made, modest, gains, but, was, disappointed, at, the, failure, of, virginians, to, extend, suffrage, to, all, white, men, in, his, later, years, madison, became, highly, concerned, about, his, historical, legacy, he, resorted, to, modifying, letters, and, other, documents, in, his, possession, changing, days, and, dates, and, adding, and, deleting, words, and, sentences, by, his, late, seventies, madison, s, self, editing, of, his, own, archived, letters, and, older, materials, had, become, almost, an, obsession, as, an, example, he, edited, a, letter, written, to, jefferson, criticizing, gilbert, du, motier, marquis, de, lafayette, madison, not, only, inked, out, original, passages, but, in, other, correspondence, he, even, forged, jefferson, s, handwriting, historian, drew, r, mccoy, wrote, during, the, final, six, years, of, his, life, amid, a, sea, of, personal, troubles, that, were, threatening, to, engulf, him, at, times, mental, agitation, issued, in, physical, collapse, for, the, better, part, of, a, year, in, 1831, and, 1832, he, was, bedridden, if, not, silenced, literally, sick, with, anxiety, he, began, to, despair, of, his, ability, to, make, himself, understood, by, his, fellow, citizens, madison, s, health, slowly, deteriorated, through, the, 1830s, he, died, of, congestive, heart, failure, at, montpelier, on, the, morning, of, june, 28, 1836, at, the, age, of, 85, according, to, one, common, account, of, his, final, moments, he, was, given, his, breakfast, which, he, tried, eating, but, was, unable, to, swallow, his, favorite, niece, nellie, madison, willis, who, sat, by, to, keep, him, company, asked, him, what, is, the, matter, uncle, james, madison, died, immediately, after, he, replied, nothing, more, than, a, change, of, mind, my, dear, he, was, buried, in, the, family, cemetery, at, montpelier, he, was, one, of, the, last, prominent, members, of, the, revolutionary, war, generation, to, die, his, last, will, and, testament, left, significant, sums, to, the, american, colonization, society, princeton, and, the, university, of, virginia, as, well, as, 30, 000, 897, 000, in, 2021, to, his, wife, dolley, left, with, a, smaller, sum, than, james, had, intended, dolley, suffered, financial, troubles, until, her, death, in, 1849, in, the, 1840s, dolley, sold, montpelier, its, remaining, slaves, and, the, furnishings, to, pay, off, outstanding, debts, paul, jennings, one, of, madison, s, younger, slaves, later, recalled, in, his, memoir, in, the, last, days, of, her, life, before, congress, purchased, her, husband, s, papers, she, was, in, a, state, of, absolute, poverty, and, i, think, sometimes, suffered, for, the, necessaries, of, life, while, i, was, a, servant, to, mr, webster, he, often, sent, me, to, her, with, a, market, basket, full, of, provisions, and, told, me, whenever, i, saw, anything, in, the, house, that, i, thought, she, was, in, need, of, to, take, it, to, her, i, often, did, this, and, occasionally, gave, her, small, sums, from, my, own, pocket, though, i, had, years, before, bought, my, freedom, of, her, during, his, first, stint, in, congress, in, the, 1780s, madison, came, to, favor, amending, the, articles, of, confederation, to, provide, for, a, stronger, central, government, in, the, 1790s, he, led, the, opposition, to, hamilton, s, centralizing, policies, and, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, madison, s, support, of, the, virginia, and, kentucky, resolutions, in, the, 1790s, has, been, referred, to, as, a, breathtaking, evolution, for, a, man, who, had, pleaded, at, the, constitutional, convention, that, the, federal, government, should, possess, a, veto, over, state, laws, others, historians, disagree, and, see, madison, s, political, philosophy, as, remarkably, consistent, perhaps, more, importantly, they, point, out, that, madison, s, loyalty, was, to, the, constitution, not, to, his, personal, preferences, madison, had, advocated, in, the, debates, of, the, constitutional, convention, that, the, proposed, federal, government, have, veto, power, over, state, laws, but, he, was, willing, to, follow, the, constitution, as, it, was, adopted, and, ratified, rather, than, what, he, might, have, wished, that, it, said, madison, had, written, in, federalist, 45, that, the, proposed, federal, government, would, have, powers, that, were, few, and, defined, as, enumerated, in, article, i, of, the, constitution, he, felt, strongly, that, to, interpret, it, otherwise, would, be, a, breach, of, faith, with, we, the, people, who, had, ratified, the, constitution, based, on, that, understanding, madison, who, was, the, author, of, the, bill, of, rights, was, also, faithfully, following, the, 10th, amendment, which, says, that, all, powers, not, delegated, to, the, united, states, by, the, constitution, nor, prohibited, by, it, to, the, states, are, reserved, to, the, states, respectively, or, to, the, people, although, baptized, as, an, anglican, and, educated, by, presbyterian, clergymen, young, madison, was, an, avid, reader, of, english, deist, tracts, as, an, adult, madison, paid, little, attention, to, religious, matters, though, most, historians, have, found, little, indication, of, his, religious, leanings, after, he, left, college, some, scholars, indicate, he, leaned, toward, deism, others, maintain, that, madison, accepted, christian, tenets, and, formed, his, outlook, on, life, with, a, christian, worldview, regardless, of, his, own, religious, beliefs, madison, believed, in, religious, liberty, and, he, advocated, for, virginia, s, disestablishment, of, religious, institutions, sponsored, by, the, state, he, also, opposed, the, appointments, of, chaplains, for, congress, and, the, armed, forces, arguing, that, the, appointments, produce, religious, exclusion, as, well, as, political, disharmony, throughout, his, life, madison, s, views, on, slavery, were, conflicted, he, was, born, into, a, plantation, society, that, relied, on, slave, labor, and, both, sides, of, his, family, profited, from, tobacco, farming, while, he, viewed, slavery, as, essential, to, the, southern, economy, he, was, troubled, by, the, instability, of, a, society, that, depended, on, a, large, slave, population, madison, also, believed, slavery, was, incompatible, with, american, revolutionary, principles, though, he, owned, over, one, hundred, african, american, slaves, according, to, historian, paris, spies, gans, madison, s, anti, slavery, thought, was, strongest, at, the, height, of, revolutionary, politics, but, by, the, early, 1800s, when, in, a, position, to, truly, impact, policy, he, failed, to, follow, through, on, these, views, spies, gans, concluded, ltimately, madison, s, personal, dependence, on, slavery, led, him, to, question, his, own, once, enlightened, definition, of, liberty, itself, madison, grew, up, on, montpelier, which, like, other, southern, plantations, depended, on, slave, labor, when, madison, left, for, college, on, august, 10, 1769, he, arrived, at, princeton, accompanied, by, his, slave, sawney, who, was, charged, with, madison, s, expenses, and, with, relaying, messages, to, his, family, back, home, in, 1783, fearing, the, possibility, of, a, slave, rebellion, at, montpelier, madison, emancipated, one, slave, billey, selling, him, into, a, seven, year, apprentice, contract, after, his, manumission, billey, changed, his, name, to, william, gardner, and, became, a, shipping, agent, representing, madison, in, philadelphia, madison, inherited, montpelier, and, its, more, than, one, hundred, slaves, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1801, that, same, year, madison, moved, to, washington, d, c, running, montpelier, from, afar, making, no, effort, to, free, his, slaves, after, his, election, to, the, presidency, in, 1808, madison, brought, his, slaves, to, the, white, house, during, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, madison, sold, some, of, his, land, and, slaves, to, repay, debt, in, 1836, at, the, time, of, madison, s, death, he, owned, 36, taxable, slaves, in, his, will, madison, gave, his, remaining, slaves, to, his, wife, dolley, and, charged, her, not, to, sell, the, slaves, without, their, permission, for, reasons, of, necessity, dolley, sold, the, slaves, without, their, permission, to, pay, off, debts, as, was, consistent, with, the, established, social, norms, of, virginia, society, madison, was, known, from, his, farm, papers, for, advocating, the, humane, treatment, of, his, slaves, he, instructed, an, overseer, to, treat, the, negroes, with, all, the, humanity, and, kindness, consistent, with, their, necessary, subordination, and, work, madison, also, ensured, that, his, slaves, had, milk, cows, and, meals, for, their, daily, food, by, the, 1790s, madison, s, slave, sawney, was, an, overseer, of, part, of, the, plantation, some, slaves, at, montpelier, could, read, paul, jennings, was, a, slave, of, the, madisons, for, 48, years, and, served, as, madison, s, footman, at, the, white, house, in, his, memoir, a, colored, man, s, reminiscences, of, james, madison, published, in, 1865, jennings, said, that, he, never, knew, to, strike, a, slave, although, he, had, over, one, hundred, neither, would, he, allow, an, overseer, to, do, it, although, jennings, condemned, slavery, he, said, that, james, was, one, of, the, best, men, that, ever, lived, and, that, dolley, was, a, remarkably, fine, woman, madison, called, slavery, the, most, oppressive, dominion, that, ever, existed, and, he, had, a, lifelong, abhorrence, for, it, in, 1785, madison, spoke, in, the, virginia, assembly, favoring, a, bill, that, thomas, jefferson, had, proposed, for, the, gradual, abolition, of, slavery, and, he, also, helped, defeat, a, bill, designed, to, outlaw, the, manumission, of, individual, slaves, as, a, slaveholder, madison, was, aware, that, owning, slaves, was, not, consistent, with, revolutionary, values, but, as, a, pragmatist, this, sort, of, self, contradiction, was, a, common, feature, in, his, political, career, historian, drew, r, mccoy, said, that, madison, s, antislavery, principles, were, indeed, impeccable, historian, ralph, ketcham, said, lthough, madison, abhorred, slavery, he, nonetheless, bore, the, burden, of, depending, all, his, life, on, a, slave, system, that, he, could, never, square, with, his, republican, beliefs, there, is, no, evidence, madison, thought, black, people, were, inferior, madison, believed, blacks, and, whites, were, unlikely, to, co, exist, peacefully, due, to, the, prejudices, of, the, whites, as, well, as, feelings, on, both, sides, inspired, by, their, former, relation, as, oppressors, and, oppressed, as, such, he, became, interested, in, the, idea, of, freedmen, establishing, colonies, in, africa, and, later, served, as, the, president, of, the, american, colonization, society, which, relocated, former, slaves, to, liberia, madison, believed, that, this, solution, offered, a, gradual, long, term, but, potentially, feasible, means, of, eradicating, slavery, in, the, united, states, but, that, peaceful, co, existence, between, the, two, racial, groups, could, eventually, be, achieved, in, the, long, run, madison, initially, opposed, the, constitution, s, 20, year, protection, of, the, foreign, slave, trade, but, he, eventually, accepted, it, as, a, necessary, compromise, to, get, the, south, to, ratify, the, document, he, also, proposed, that, apportionment, in, the, house, of, representatives, be, according, to, each, state, s, free, and, enslaved, population, eventually, leading, to, the, adoption, of, the, three, fifths, compromise, madison, supported, the, extension, of, slavery, into, the, west, during, the, missouri, crisis, of, 1819, 1821, asserting, that, the, spread, of, slavery, would, not, lead, to, more, slaves, but, rather, diminish, their, generative, increase, through, dispersing, them, thus, substantially, improving, their, condition, accelerating, emancipation, easing, racial, tensions, and, increasing, partial, manumissions, madison, thought, of, slaves, as, wayward, but, still, educable, students, in, need, of, regular, guidance, regarded, as, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, madison, had, a, wide, influence, on, the, founding, of, the, nation, and, upon, the, early, development, of, american, constitutional, government, and, foreign, policy, historian, j, c, a, stagg, writes, that, in, some, ways, because, he, was, on, the, winning, side, of, every, important, issue, facing, the, young, nation, from, 1776, to, 1816, madison, was, the, most, successful, and, possibly, the, most, influential, of, all, the, founding, fathers, though, he, helped, found, a, major, political, party, and, served, as, the, fourth, president, his, legacy, has, largely, been, defined, by, his, contributions, to, the, constitution, even, in, his, own, life, he, was, hailed, as, the, father, of, the, constitution, law, professor, noah, feldman, writes, that, madison, invented, and, theorized, the, modern, ideal, of, an, expanded, federal, constitution, that, combines, local, self, government, with, an, overarching, national, order, feldman, adds, that, madison, s, model, of, liberty, protecting, constitutional, government, is, the, most, influential, american, idea, in, global, political, history, various, rankings, of, historians, and, political, scientists, tend, to, rank, madison, as, an, above, average, president, with, a, 2018, poll, of, the, american, political, science, association, s, presidents, and, executive, politics, section, ranking, madison, as, the, twelfth, best, president, various, historians, have, criticized, madison, s, tenure, as, president, in, 1968, henry, steele, commager, and, richard, b, morris, said, the, conventional, view, of, madison, was, of, an, incapable, president, who,
