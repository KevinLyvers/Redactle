convinced, pierre, to, become, a, priest, but, was, unable, to, convince, francis, who, had, aspirations, of, worldly, advancement, at, first, francis, regarded, the, new, lodger, as, a, joke, and, was, sarcastic, about, his, efforts, to, convert, students, when, pierre, left, their, lodgings, to, visit, his, family, and, ignatius, was, alone, with, francis, he, was, able, to, slowly, break, down, francis, s, resistance, according, to, most, biographies, ignatius, is, said, to, have, posed, the, question, what, will, it, profit, a, man, to, gain, the, whole, world, and, lose, his, own, soul, however, according, to, james, broderick, such, method, is, not, characteristic, of, ignatius, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, employed, it, at, all, in, 1530, francis, received, the, degree, of, master, of, arts, and, afterwards, taught, aristotelian, philosophy, at, the, coll, ge, de, beauvais, university, of, paris, on, 15, august, 1534, seven, students, met, in, a, crypt,

drew, up, a, formula, for, a, new, religious, order, the, society, of, jesus, the, jesuits, ignatius, s, plan, for, the, order, was, approved, by, pope, paul, iii, in, 1540, in, 1540, king, john, iii, of, portugal, had, pedro, mascarenhas, portuguese, ambassador, to, the, holy, see, request, jesuit, missionaries, to, spread, the, faith, in, his, new, possessions, in, india, where, the, king, believed, that, christian, values, were, eroding, among, the, portuguese, after, successive, appeals, to, the, pope, asking, for, missionaries, for, the, east, indies, under, the, padroado, agreement, john, iii, was, encouraged, by, diogo, de, gouveia, rector, of, the, coll, ge, sainte, barbe, to, recruit, the, newly, graduated, students, who, had, established, the, society, of, jesus, ignatius, promptly, appointed, nicholas, bobadilla, and, sim, o, rodrigues, at, the, last, moment, however, bobadilla, became, seriously, ill, with, some, hesitance, and, uneasiness, ignatius, asked, francis, to, go, in, bobadilla, s, place, thus, francis, xavier, began, his, life, as, the, first, jesuit, missionary, almost, accidentally, leaving, rome, on, 15, march, 1540, in, the, ambassador, s, train, francis, took, with, him, a, breviary, a, catechism, and, de, institutione, bene, vivendi, by, croatian, humanist, marko, maruli, a, latin, book, that, had, become, popular, in, the, counter, reformation, according, to, a, 1549, letter, of, f, balthasar, gago, from, goa, it, was, the, only, book, that, francis, read, or, studied, francis, reached, lisbon, in, june, 1540, and, four, days, after, his, arrival, he, and, rodrigues, were, summoned, to, a, private, audience, with, king, john, and, queen, catherine, francis, xavier, devoted, much, of, his, life, to, missions, in, asia, mainly, in, four, centres, malacca, amboina, and, ternate, in, the, maluku, islands, of, indonesia, japan, and, off, shore, china, his, growing, information, about, new, places, indicated, to, him, that, he, had, to, go, to, what, he, understood, were, centres, of, influence, for, the, whole, region, china, loomed, large, from, his, days, in, india, japan, was, particularly, attractive, because, of, its, culture, for, him, these, areas, were, interconnected, they, could, not, be, evangelised, separately, francis, xavier, left, lisbon, on, 7, april, 1541, his, thirty, fifth, birthday, along, with, two, other, jesuits, and, the, new, viceroy, martim, afonso, de, sousa, on, board, the, santiago, as, he, departed, francis, was, given, a, brief, from, the, pope, appointing, him, apostolic,

after, leaving, lisbon, the, portuguese, following, quickly, on, the, great, voyages, of, discovery, had, established, themselves, at, goa, thirty, years, earlier, francis, s, primary, mission, as, ordered, by, king, john, iii, was, to, restore, christianity, among, the, portuguese, settlers, according, to, teotonio, r, desouza, recent, critical, accounts, indicate, that, apart, from, the, posted, civil, servants, the, great, majority, of, those, who, were, dispatched, as, discoverers, were, the, riff, raff, of, portuguese, society, picked, up, from, portuguese, jails, nor, did, the, soldiers, sailors, or, merchants, come, to, do, missionary, work, and, imperial, policy, permitted, the, outflow, of, disaffected, nobility, many, of, the, arrivals, formed, liaisons, with, local, women, and, adopted, indian, culture, missionaries, often, wrote, against, the, scandalous, and, undisciplined, behaviour, of, their, fellow, christians, the, christian, population, had, churches, clergy, and, a, bishop, but, there, were, few, preachers, and, no, priests, beyond, the, walls, of, goa, xavier, decided, that, he, must, begin, by, instructing, the, portuguese, themselves, and, gave, much, of, his, time, to, the, teaching, of, children, the, first, five, months, he, spent, in, preaching, and, ministering, to, the, sick, in, the, hospitals, after, that, he, walked, through, the, streets, ringing, a, bell, to, summon, the, children, and, servants, to, catechism, he, was, invited, to, head, saint, paul, s, college, a, pioneer, seminary, for, the, education, of, secular,

sail, for, cape, comorin, in, october, 1542, he, taught, those, who, had, already, been, baptised, and, preached, to, those, who, weren, t, his, efforts, with, the, high, caste, brahmins, remained, unavailing, the, brahmin, and, muslim, authorities, in, travancore, opposed, xavier, with, violence, time, and, again, his, hut, was, burned, down, over, his, head, and, once, he, saved, his, life,

island, of, celebes, today, s, indonesia, as, the, first, jesuit, in, india, francis, had, difficulty, achieving, much, success, in, his, missionary, trips, his, successors, such, as, roberto, de, nobili, matteo, ricci, and, constanzo, beschi, attempted, to, convert, the, noblemen, first, as, a, means, to, influence, more, people, while, francis, had, initially, interacted, most, with, the, lower, classes, later, though, in, japan, francis, changed, tack, by, paying, tribute, to, the, emperor, and, seeking, an, audience, with, him, in, the, spring, of, 1545, xavier, started, for,

outnumbered, in, malacca, in, december, 1547, francis, xavier, met, a, japanese, man, named, anjir, anjir, had, heard, of, francis, in, 1545, and, had, travelled, from, kagoshima, to, malacca, to,

the, first, japanese, christian, and, adopted, the, name, paulo, de, santa, fe, he, later, helped, xavier, as, a, mediator, and, interpreter, for, the, mission, to, japan, that, now, seemed, much, more, possible, in, january, 1548, francis, returned, to, goa, to, attend, to, his, responsibilities, as, superior, of, the, mission, there, the, next, 15, months, were, occupied, with, various,

companions, in, europe, i, asked, a, portuguese, merchant, who, had, been, for, many, days, in, anjir, s, country, of, japan, to, give, me, some, information, on, that, land, and, its, people, from, what, he, had, seen, and, heard, all, the, portuguese, merchants, coming, from, japan, tell, me, that, if, i, go, there, i, shall, do, great, service, for, god, our, lord, more, than, with, the,

first, place, father, master, francisco, stopped, at, there, were, a, good, number, of, christians, although, there, was, no, one, there, to, teach, them, the, shortage, of, labourers, prevented, the, whole, kingdom, from, becoming, christian, francis, was, the, first, jesuit, to, go, to, japan, as, a, missionary, he, brought, with, him, paintings, of, the, madonna, and, the, madonna, and, child, these, paintings, were, used, to, help, teach, the, japanese, about, christianity, there, was, a, huge, language, barrier, as, japanese, was, unlike, other, languages, the, missionaries, had, previously, encountered, for, a, long, time, francis, struggled, to, learn, the, language, he, was, hosted, by, anjir, s, family, until, october, 1550, from, october, to, december, 1550, he, resided, in, yamaguchi, shortly, before, christmas, he, left, for, kyoto, but, failed, to, meet, with, emperor, go, nara, he, returned, to, yamaguchi, in, march, 1551, where, the, daimy, of, the, province, gave, him, permission, to, preach, having, learned, that, evangelical, poverty, did, not, have, the, appeal, in, japan, that, it, had, in, europe, and, in, india, he, decided, to, change, his, approach, hearing, after, a, time, that, a, portuguese, ship, had, arrived, at, a, port, in, the, province, of, bungo, in, kyushu, and, that, the, prince, there, would, like, to, see, him, xavier, now, set, out, southward, the, jesuit, in, a, fine, cassock, surplice, and, stole, was, attended, by, thirty, gentlemen, and, as, many, servants, all, in, their, best, clothes, five, of, them, bore, on, cushions, valuable, articles, including, a, portrait, of, our, lady, and, a, pair, of, velvet, slippers, these, not, gifts, for, the, prince, but, solemn, offerings, to, xavier, to, impress, the, onlookers, with, his, eminence, handsomely, dressed, with, his, companions, acting, as, attendants, he, presented, himself, before, oshindono, the, ruler, of, nagate, and, as, a, representative, of, the, great, kingdom, of, portugal, offered, him, letters, and, presents, a, musical, instrument, a, watch, and, other, attractive, objects, which, had, been, given, him, by, the, authorities, in, india, for, the, emperor, for, forty, five, years, the, jesuits, were, the, only, missionaries, in, asia, but, the, franciscans, began, proselytizing, in, asia, as, well, christian, missionaries, were, later, forced, into, exile, along, with, their, assistants, however, some, were, able, to, stay, behind, christianity, was, then, kept, underground, so, as, to, not, be, persecuted, the, japanese, people, were, not, easily, converted, many, of, the, people, were, already, buddhist, or, shinto, francis, tried, to, combat, the, reservations, of, some, of, the, japanese, many, mistakenly, interpreted, catholic, doctrine, as, teaching, that, demons, had, been, created, evil, and, they, thus, concluded, the, god, who, had, created, them, could, not, be, good, much, of, francis, preaching, was, devoted, to, providing, answers, to, this, and, other, such, challenges, in, the, course, of, these, discussions, francis, grew, to, respect, the, rationality, and, general, literacy, of, those, japanese, people, whom, he, encountered, he, expressed, optimism, at, the, prospect, of, converting, the, country, xavier, was, welcomed, by, the, shingon, monks, since, he, used, the, word, dainichi, for, the, christian, god, attempting, to, adapt, the, concept, to, local, traditions, as, xavier, learned, more, about, the, religious, nuances, of, the, word, he, changed, to, deusu, from, the, latin, and, portuguese, deus, the, monks, later, realised, that, xavier, was, preaching, a, rival, religion, and, grew, more, resistant, towards, his, attempts, at, conversion, with, the, passage, of, time, his, sojourn, in, japan, could, be, considered, somewhat, fruitful, as, attested, by, congregations, established, in, hirado, yamaguchi, and, bungo, xavier, worked, for, more, than, two, years, in, japan, and, saw, his, successor, jesuits, established, he, then, decided, to, return, to, india, historians, debate, the, exact, path, by, which, he, returned, but, from, evidence, attributed, to, the, captain, of, his, ship, he, may, have, travelled, through, tanegeshima, and, minato, and, avoided, kagoshima, because, of, the, hostility, of, the, daimyo, during, his, trip, from, japan, back, to, india, a, tempest, forced, him, to, stop, on, an, island, near, guangzhou, guangdong, china, where, he, met, diogo, pereira, a, rich, merchant, and, an, old, friend, from, cochin, pereira, showed, him, a, letter, from, portuguese, prisoners, in, guangzhou, asking, for, a, portuguese, ambassador, to, speak, to, the, jiajing, emperor, on, their, behalf, later, during,

planned, to, introduce, himself, as, apostolic, nuncio, and, pereira, as, the, ambassador, of, the, king, of, portugal, but, then, he, realized, that, he, had, forgotten, his, testimonial, letters, as, an, apostolic, nuncio, back, in, malacca, he, was, confronted, by, the, captain, lvaro, de, ata, de, da, gama, who, now, had, total, control, over, the, harbour, the, captain, refused, to, recognize, his, title, of, nuncio, asked, pereira, to, resign, from, his, title, of, ambassador, named, a, new, crew, for, the, ship, and, demanded, the, gifts, for, the, chinese, emperor, be, left,
