claude, bernard, french, 12, july, 1813, 10, february, 1878, was, a, french, physiologist, historian, i, bernard, cohen, of, harvard, university, called, bernard, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, men, of, science, he, originated, the, term, milieu, int, rieur, and, the, associated, concept, of, homeostasis, the, latter, term, being, coined, by, walter, cannon, bernard, was, born, in, 12, july, 1813, in, the, village, of, saint, julien, near, villefranche, sur, sa, ne, he, received, his, early, education, in, the, jesuit, school, of, that, town, and, then, proceeded, to, the, college, at, lyon, which, however, he, soon, left, to, become, assistant, in, a, druggist, s, shop, he, is, sometimes, described, as, an, agnostic, and, even, humorously, referred, to, by, his, colleagues, as, a, great, priest, of, atheism, despite, this, after, his, death, cardinal, ferdinand, donnet, claimed, bernard, was, a, fervent, catholic, with, a, biographical, entry, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, his, leisure, hours, were, devoted, to, the, composition, of, a, vaudeville, comedy, and, the, success, it, achieved, moved, him, to, attempt, a, prose, drama, in, five, acts, arthur, de, bretagne, in, 1834, at, the, age, of, twenty, one, he, went, to, paris, armed, with, this, play, and, an, introduction, to, saint, marc, girardin, but, the, critic, dissuaded, him, from, adopting, literature, as, a, profession, and, urged, him, rather, to, take, up, the, study, of, medicine, this, advice, bernard, followed, and, in, due, course, he, became, interne, at, the, h, tel, dieu, de, paris, in, this, way, he, was, brought, into, contact, with, the, great, physiologist, fran, ois, magendie, who, served, as, physician, at, the, hospital, bernard, became, preparateur, lab, assistant, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, 1841, in, 1845, bernard, married, marie, fran, oise, fanny, martin, for, convenience, the, marriage, was, arranged, by, a, colleague, and, her, dowry, helped, finance, his, experiments, in, 1847, he, was, appointed, magendie, s, deputy, professor, at, the, college, and, in, 1855, he, succeeded, him, as, full, professor, in, 1860, bernard, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, his, field, of, research, was, considered, inferior, at, the, time, the, laboratory, assigned, to, him, was, simply, a, regular, cellar, some, time, previously, bernard, had, been, chosen, to, be, the, first, occupant, of, the, newly, instituted, chair, of, physiology, at, the, sorbonne, but, no, laboratory, was, provided, for, his, use, it, was, louis, napoleon, who, after, an, interview, with, him, in, 1864, repaired, the, deficiency, building, a, laboratory, at, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, the, jardin, des, plantes, at, the, same, time, napoleon, iii, established, a, professorship, which, bernard, accepted, leaving, the, sorbonne, in, the, same, year, 1868, he, was, also, admitted, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, and, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, when, he, died, on, 10, february, 1878, he, was, accorded, a, public, funeral, an, honor, which, had, never, before, been, bestowed, by, france, on, a, man, of, science, he, was, interred, in, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, at, the, age, of, 19, claude, bernard, wrote, an, autobiographical, prose, play, in, five, acts, called, arthur, de, bretagne, which, was, published, only, after, his, death, a, second, edition, appeared, in, 1943, patron, claude, bernard, s, aim, as, he, stated, in, his, own, words, was, to, establish, the, use, of, the, scientific, method, in, medicine, he, dismissed, several, previous, misconceptions, questioned, common, presumptions, and, relied, on, experimentation, claude, bernard, s, first, important, work, was, on, the, functions, of, the, pancreas, the, juice, of, which, he, proved, to, be, of, great, significance, in, the, process, of, digestion, this, achievement, won, him, the, prize, for, experimental, physiology, from, the, french, academy, of, sciences, a, second, investigation, perhaps, his, most, famous, was, on, the, glycogenic, function, of, the, liver, in, the, course, of, his, study, he, was, led, to, the, conclusion, which, throws, light, on, the, causation, of, diabetes, mellitus, that, the, liver, in, addition, to, secreting, bile, is, the, seat, of, an, internal, secretion, by, which, it, prepares, sugar, at, the, expense, of, the, elements, of, the, blood, passing, through, it, a, third, research, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, the, vasomotor, system, in, 1851, while, examining, the, effects, produced, in, the, temperature, of, various, parts, of, the, body, by, section, of, the, nerve, or, nerves, belonging, to, them, he, noticed, that, division, of, the, cervical, sympathetic, nerve, gave, rise, to, more, active, circulation, and, more, forcible, pulsation, of, the, arteries, in, certain, parts, of, the, head, and, a, few, months, afterwards, he, observed, that, electrical, excitation, of, the, upper, portion, of, the, divided, nerve, had, the, contrary, effect, in, this, way, he, established, the, existence, of, both, vasodilator, and, vasoconstrictor, nerves, the, study, of, the, physiological, action, of, poisons, was, also, of, great, interest, to, him, his, attention, being, devoted, in, particular, to, curare, and, carbon, monoxide, gas, bernard, is, widely, credited, with, first, describing, carbon, monoxide, s, affinity, for, hemoglobin, in, 1857, although, james, watt, had, drawn, similar, conclusions, about, hydrocarbonate, s, affinity, for, blood, acting, as, an, antidote, to, the, oxygen, in, 1794, prior, to, the, discoveries, of, carbon, monoxide, and, hemoglobin, milieu, int, rieur, is, the, key, concept, with, which, bernard, is, associated, he, wrote, the, stability, of, the, internal, environment, is, the, condition, for, the, free, and, independent, life, this, is, the, underlying, principle, of, what, would, later, be, called, homeostasis, a, term, coined, by, walter, cannon, he, also, explained, that, the, living, body, though, it, has, need, of, the, surrounding, environment, is, nevertheless, relatively, independent, of, it, this, independence, which, the, organism, has, of, its, external, environment, derives, from, the, fact, that, in, the, living, being, the, tissues, are, in, fact, withdrawn, from, direct, external, influences, and, are, protected, by, a, veritable, internal, environment, which, is, constituted, in, particular, by, the, fluids, circulating, in, the, body, the, constancy, of, the, internal, environment, is, the, condition, for, free, and, independent, life, the, mechanism, that, makes, it, possible, is, that, which, assured, the, maintenance, within, the, internal, environment, of, all, the, conditions, necessary, for, the, life, of, the, elements, the, constancy, of, the, environment, presupposes, a, perfection, of, the, organism, such, that, external, variations, are, at, every, instant, compensated, and, brought, into, balance, in, consequence, far, from, being, indifferent, to, the, external, world, the, higher, animal, is, on, the, contrary, in, a, close, and, wise, relation, with, it, so, that, its, equilibrium, results, from, a, continuous, and, delicate, compensation, established, as, if, the, most, sensitive, of, balances, bernard, s, scientific, discoveries, were, made, through, vivisection, of, which, he, was, the, primary, proponent, in, europe, at, the, time, he, wrote, bernard, practiced, vivisection, to, the, disgust, of, his, wife, and, daughters, who, had, returned, at, home, to, discover, that, he, had, vivisected, their, dog, the, couple, was, officially, separated, in, 1869, and, his, wife, went, on, to, actively, campaign, against, the, practice, of, vivisection, his, wife, and, daughters, were, not, the, only, ones, disgusted, by, bernard, s, animal, experiments, the, physician, scientist, george, hoggan, spent, four, months, observing, and, working, in, bernard, s, laboratory, and, was, one, of, the, few, contemporary, authors, to, chronicle, what, went, on, there, he, was, later, moved, to, write, that, his, experiences, in, bernard, s, lab, had, made, him, prepared, to, see, not, only, science, but, even, mankind, perish, rather, than, have, recourse, to, such, means, of, saving, it, in, his, major, discourse, on, the, scientific, method, an, introduction, to, the, study, of, experimental, medicine, 1865, bernard, described, what, makes, a, scientific, theory, good, and, what, makes, a, scientist, important, a, true, discoverer, unlike, many, scientific, writers, of, his, time, bernard, wrote, about, his, own, experiments, and, thoughts, and, used, the, first, person, known, and, unknown, what, makes, a, scientist, important, he, states, is, how, well, he, or, she, has, penetrated, into, the, unknown, in, areas, of, science, where, the, facts, are, known, to, everyone, all, scientists, are, more, or, less, equal, we, cannot, know, who, is, great, but, in, the, area, of, science, that, is, still, obscure, and, unknown, the, great, are, recognized, they, are, marked, by, ideas, which, light, up, phenomena, hitherto, obscure, and, carry, science, forward, authority, vs, observation, it, is, through, the, experimental, method, that, science, is, carried, forward, not, through, uncritically, accepting, the, authority, of, academic, or, scholastic, sources, in, the, experimental, method, observable, reality, is, our, only, authority, bernard, writes, with, scientific, fervor, induction, and, deduction, experimental, science, is, a, constant, interchange, between, theory, and, fact, induction, and, deduction, induction, reasoning, from, the, particular, to, the, general, and, deduction, or, reasoning, from, the, general, to, the, particular, are, never, truly, separate, a, general, theory, and, our, theoretical, deductions, from, it, must, be, tested, with, specific, experiments, designed, to, confirm, or, deny, their, truth, while, these, particular, experiments, may, lead, us, to, formulate, new, theories, cause, and, effect, the, scientist, tries, to, determine, the, relation, of, cause, and, effect, this, is, true, for, all, sciences, the, goal, is, to, connect, a, natural, phenomenon, with, its, immediate, cause, we, formulate, hypotheses, elucidating, as, we, see, it, the, relation, of, cause, and, effect, for, particular, phenomena, we, test, the, hypotheses, and, when, an, hypothesis, is, proved, it, is, a, scientific, theory, before, that, we, have, only, groping, and, empiricism, verification, and, disproof, bernard, explains, what, makes, a, theory, good, or, bad, scientifically, when, have, we, verified, that, we, have, found, a, cause, bernard, states, we, must, always, try, to, disprove, our, own, theories, we, can, solidly, settle, our, ideas, only, by, trying, to, destroy, our, own, conclusions, by, counter, experiments, what, is, observably, true, is, the, only, authority, if, through, experiment, you, contradict, your, own, conclusions, you, must, accept, the, contradiction, but, only, on, one, condition, that, the, contradiction, is, proved, determinism, and, averages, in, the, study, of, disease, the, real, and, effective, cause, of, a, disease, must, be, constant, and, determined, that, is, unique, anything, else, would, be, a, denial, of, science, in, medicine, in, fact, a, very, frequent, application, of, mathematics, to, biology, the, use, of, averages, that, is, statistics, which, may, give, only, apparent, accuracy, sometimes, averages, do, not, give, the, kind, of, information, needed, to, save, lives, for, example, although, the, application, of, mathematics, to, every, aspect, of, science, is, its, ultimate, goal, biology, is, still, too, complex, and, poorly, understood, therefore, for, now, the, goal, of, medical, science, should, be, to, discover, all, the, new, facts, possible, qualitative, analysis, must, always, precede, quantitative, analysis, truth, vs, falsification, the, philosophic, spirit, writes, bernard, is, always, active, in, its, desire, for, truth, it, stimulates, a, kind, of, thirst, for, the, unknown, which, ennobles, and, enlivens, science, where, as, experimenters, we, need, only, to, stand, face, to, face, with, nature, the, minds, that, are, great, are, never, self, satisfied, but, still, continue, to, strive, among, the, great, minds, he, names, joseph, priestley, and, blaise, pascal, meanwhile, there, are, those, whose, minds, are, bound, and, cramped, they, oppose, discovering, the, unknown, which, is, generally, an, unforeseen, relation, not, included, in, theory, because, they, do, not, want, to, discover, anything, that, might, disprove, their, own, theories, bernard, calls, them, despisers, of, their, fellows, and, says, the, dominant, idea, of, these, despisers, of, their, fellows, is, to, find, others, theories, faulty, and, try, to, contradict, them, they, are, deceptive, for, in, their, experiments, they, report, only, results, that, make, their, theories, seem, correct, and, suppress, results, that, support, their, rivals, in, this, way, they, falsify, science, and, the, facts, discovering, vs, despising, the, despisers, of, their, fellows, lack, the, ardent, desire, for, knowledge, that, the, true, scientific, spirit, will, always, have, and, so, the, progress, of, science, will, never, be, stopped, by, them, bernard, writes, attribution
