jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, jr, dutch, 30, august, 1852, 1, march, 1911, was, a, dutch, physical, chemist, a, highly, influential, theoretical, chemist, of, his, time, van, t, hoff, was, the, first, winner, of, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, his, pioneering, work, helped, found, the, modern, theory, of, chemical, affinity, chemical, equilibrium, chemical, kinetics, and, chemical, thermodynamics, in, his, 1874, pamphlet, van, t, hoff, formulated, the, theory, of, the, tetrahedral, carbon, atom, and, laid, the, foundations, of, stereochemistry, in, 1875, he, predicted, the, correct, structures, of, allenes, and, cumulenes, as, well, as, their, axial, chirality, he, is, also, widely, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, physical, chemistry, as, the, discipline, is, known, today, the, third, of, seven, children, van, t, hoff, was, born, in, rotterdam, netherlands, 30, august, 1852, his, father, was, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, sr, a, physician, and, his, mother, was, alida, kolff, van, t, hoff, from, a, young, age, he, was, interested, in, science, and, nature, and, frequently, took, part, in, botanical, excursions, in, his, early, school, years, he, showed, a, strong, interest, in, poetry, and, philosophy, he, considered, lord, byron, to, be, his, idol, against, the, wishes, of, his, father, van, t, hoff, chose, to, study, chemistry, first, he, enrolled, at, delft, university, of, technology, in, september, 1869, and, studied, until, 1871, when, he, passed, his, final, exam, on, 8, july, and, obtained, a, degree, of, chemical, technologist, he, passed, all, his, courses, in, two, years, although, the, time, assigned, to, study, was, three, years, then, he, enrolled, at, university, of, leiden, to, study, chemistry, he, then, studied, in, bonn, germany, with, august, kekul, and, in, paris, with, adolphe, wurtz, he, received, his, doctorate, under, eduard, mulder, at, the, university, of, utrecht, in, 1874, in, 1878, van, t, hoff, married, johanna, francina, mees, they, had, two, daughters, johanna, francina, 1880, 1964, and, aleida, jacoba, 1882, 1971, and, two, sons, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, iii, 1883, 1943, and, govert, jacob, 1889, 1918, van, t, hoff, died, at, the, age, of, 58, on, 1, march, 1911, at, steglitz, near, berlin, of, tuberculosis, van, t, hoff, earned, his, earliest, reputation, in, the, field, of, organic, chemistry, in, 1874, he, accounted, for, the, phenomenon, of, optical, activity, by, assuming, that, the, chemical, bonds, between, carbon, atoms, and, their, neighbors, were, directed, towards, the, corners, of, a, regular, tetrahedron, this, three, dimensional, structure, accounted, for, the, isomers, found, in, nature, he, shares, credit, for, this, with, the, french, chemist, joseph, le, bel, who, independently, came, up, with, the, same, idea, three, months, before, his, doctoral, degree, was, awarded, van, t, hoff, published, this, theory, which, today, is, regarded, as, the, foundation, of, stereochemistry, first, in, a, dutch, pamphlet, in, the, fall, of, 1874, and, then, in, the, following, may, in, a, small, french, book, entitled, la, chimie, dans, l, espace, a, german, translation, appeared, in, 1877, at, a, time, when, the, only, job, van, t, hoff, could, find, was, at, the, veterinary, school, in, utrecht, in, these, early, years, his, theory, was, largely, ignored, by, the, scientific, community, and, was, sharply, criticized, by, one, prominent, chemist, hermann, kolbe, kolbe, wrote, a, dr, j, h, van, t, hoff, of, the, veterinary, school, at, utrecht, has, no, liking, apparently, for, exact, chemical, investigation, he, has, considered, it, more, convenient, to, mount, pegasus, apparently, borrowed, from, the, veterinary, school, and, to, proclaim, in, his, la, chimie, dans, l, espace, how, in, his, bold, flight, to, the, top, of, the, chemical, parnassus, the, atoms, appeared, to, him, to, be, arranged, in, cosmic, space, however, by, about, 1880, support, for, van, t, hoff, s, theory, by, such, important, chemists, as, johannes, wislicenus, and, viktor, meyer, brought, recognition, in, 1884, van, t, hoff, published, his, research, on, chemical, kinetics, titled, tudes, de, dynamique, chimique, studies, in, chemical, dynamics, in, which, he, described, a, new, method, for, determining, the, order, of, a, reaction, using, graphics, and, applied, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, to, chemical, equilibria, he, also, introduced, the, modern, concept, of, chemical, affinity, in, 1886, he, showed, a, similarity, between, the, behaviour, of, dilute, solutions, and, gases, in, 1887, he, and, german, chemist, wilhelm, ostwald, founded, an, influential, scientific, magazine, named, zeitschrift, f, r, physikalische, chemie, journal, of, physical, chemistry, he, worked, on, svante, arrhenius, s, theory, of, the, dissociation, of, electrolytes, and, in, 1889, provided, physical, justification, for, the, arrhenius, equation, in, 1896, he, became, a, professor, at, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, in, berlin, his, studies, of, the, salt, deposits, at, stassfurt, were, an, important, contribution, to, prussia, s, chemical, industry, van, t, hoff, became, a, lecturer, in, chemistry, and, physics, at, the, veterinary, college, in, utrecht, he, then, worked, as, a, professor, of, chemistry, mineralogy, and, geology, at, the, university, of, amsterdam, for, almost, 18, years, before, eventually, becoming, the, chairman, of, the, chemistry, department, in, 1896, van, t, hoff, moved, to, germany, where, he, finished, his, career, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1911, in, 1901, he, received, the, first, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, with, solutions, his, work, showed, that, very, dilute, solutions, follow, mathematical, laws, that, closely, resemble, the, laws, describing, the, behavior, of, gases, in, 1885, van, t, hoff, was, appointed, as, a, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1904, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, other, distinctions, include, honorary, doctorates, from, harvard, and, yale, 1901, victoria, university, the, university, of, manchester, 1903, and, university, of, heidelberg, 1908, he, was, awarded, the, davy, medal, of, the, royal, society, in, 1893, along, with, le, bel, and, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1897, he, was, awarded, the, helmholtz, medal, of, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, 1911, and, appointed, knight, of, the, french, legion, of, honour, 1894, and, senator, in, the, kaiser, wilhelm, gesellschaft, 1911, van, t, hoff, became, an, honorary, member, of, the, british, chemical, society, in, london, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, 1892, american, chemical, society, 1898, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, paris, 1905, and, the, netherlands, chemical, society, 1908, of, his, numerous, distinctions, van, t, hoff, regarded, winning, the, first, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, as, the, culmination, of, his, career, the, following, are, named, after, him, on, 14, may, 2021, asteroid, 34978, van, t, hoff, discovered, by, astronomers, with, the, palomar, leiden, survey, in, 1977, was, named, in, his, memory
