baron, sim, on, denis, poisson, frs, frse, french, 21, june, 1781, 25, april, 1840, was, a, french, mathematician, and, physicist, who, worked, on, statistics, complex, analysis, partial, differential, equations, the, calculus, of, variations, analytical, mechanics, electricity, and, magnetism, thermodynamics, elasticity, and, fluid, mechanics, moreover, he, predicted, the, arago, spot, in, his, attempt, to, disprove, the, wave, theory, of, augustin, jean, fresnel, poisson, was, born, in, pithiviers, loiret, district, in, france, the, son, of, sim, on, poisson, an, officer, in, the, french, army, in, 1798, he, entered, the, cole, polytechnique, in, paris, as, first, in, his, year, and, immediately, began, to, attract, the, notice, of, the, professors, of, the, school, who, left, him, free, to, make, his, own, decisions, as, to, what, he, would, study, in, his, final, year, of, study, less, than, two, years, after, his, entry, he, published, two, memoirs, one, on, tienne, b, zout, s, method, of, elimination, the, other, on, the, number, of, integrals, of, a, finite, difference, equation, and, this, was, so, impressive, that, he, was, allowed, to, graduate, in, 1800, without, taking, the, final, examination, the, latter, of, the, memoirs, was, examined, by, sylvestre, fran, ois, lacroix, and, adrien, marie, legendre, who, recommended, that, it, should, be, published, in, the, recueil, des, savants, trangers, an, unprecedented, honor, for, a, youth, of, eighteen, this, success, at, once, procured, entry, for, poisson, into, scientific, circles, joseph, louis, lagrange, whose, lectures, on, the, theory, of, functions, he, attended, at, the, cole, polytechnique, recognized, his, talent, early, on, and, became, his, friend, meanwhile, pierre, simon, laplace, in, whose, footsteps, poisson, followed, regarded, him, almost, as, his, son, the, rest, of, his, career, until, his, death, in, sceaux, near, paris, was, occupied, by, the, composition, and, publication, of, his, many, works, and, in, fulfilling, the, duties, of, the, numerous, educational, positions, to, which, he, was, successively, appointed, immediately, after, finishing, his, studies, at, the, cole, polytechnique, he, was, appointed, r, p, titeur, teaching, assistant, there, a, position, which, he, had, occupied, as, an, amateur, while, still, a, pupil, in, the, school, for, his, schoolmates, had, made, a, custom, of, visiting, him, in, his, room, after, an, unusually, difficult, lecture, to, hear, him, repeat, and, explain, it, he, was, made, deputy, professor, professeur, suppl, ant, in, 1802, and, in, 1806, full, professor, succeeding, jean, baptiste, joseph, fourier, whom, napoleon, had, sent, to, grenoble, in, 1808, he, became, astronomer, to, the, bureau, des, longitudes, and, when, the, facult, des, sciences, de, paris, was, instituted, in, 1809, he, was, appointed, a, professor, of, rational, mechanics, professeur, de, m, canique, rationelle, he, went, on, to, become, a, member, of, the, institute, in, 1812, examiner, at, the, military, school, cole, militaire, at, saint, cyr, in, 1815, graduation, examiner, at, the, cole, polytechnique, in, 1816, councillor, of, the, university, in, 1820, and, geometer, to, the, bureau, des, longitudes, succeeding, pierre, simon, laplace, in, 1827, in, 1817, he, married, nancy, de, bardi, and, with, her, he, had, four, children, his, father, whose, early, experiences, had, led, him, to, hate, aristocrats, bred, him, in, the, stern, creed, of, the, first, republic, throughout, the, revolution, the, empire, and, the, following, restoration, poisson, was, not, interested, in, politics, concentrating, instead, on, mathematics, he, was, appointed, to, the, dignity, of, baron, in, 1825, but, he, neither, took, out, the, diploma, nor, used, the, title, in, march, 1818, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1822, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, and, in, 1823, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, the, revolution, of, july, 1830, threatened, him, with, the, loss, of, all, his, honours, but, this, disgrace, to, the, government, of, louis, philippe, was, adroitly, averted, by, fran, ois, jean, dominique, arago, who, while, his, revocation, was, being, plotted, by, the, council, of, ministers, procured, him, an, invitation, to, dine, at, the, palais, royal, where, he, was, openly, and, effusively, received, by, the, citizen, king, who, remembered, him, after, this, of, course, his, degradation, was, impossible, and, seven, years, later, he, was, made, a, peer, of, france, not, for, political, reasons, but, as, a, representative, of, french, science, as, a, teacher, of, mathematics, poisson, is, said, to, have, been, extraordinarily, successful, as, might, have, been, expected, from, his, early, promise, as, a, r, p, titeur, at, the, cole, polytechnique, notwithstanding, his, many, official, duties, he, found, time, to, publish, more, than, three, hundred, works, several, of, them, extensive, treatises, and, many, of, them, memoirs, dealing, with, the, most, abstruse, branches, of, pure, mathematics, applied, mathematics, mathematical, physics, and, rational, mechanics, arago, attributed, to, him, the, quote, life, is, good, for, only, two, things, doing, mathematics, and, teaching, it, a, list, of, poisson, s, works, drawn, up, by, himself, is, given, at, the, end, of, arago, s, biography, all, that, is, possible, is, a, brief, mention, of, the, more, important, ones, it, was, in, the, application, of, mathematics, to, physics, that, his, greatest, services, to, science, were, performed, perhaps, the, most, original, and, certainly, the, most, permanent, in, their, influence, were, his, memoirs, on, the, theory, of, electricity, and, magnetism, which, virtually, created, a, new, branch, of, mathematical, physics, next, or, in, the, opinion, of, some, first, in, importance, stand, the, memoirs, on, celestial, mechanics, in, which, he, proved, himself, a, worthy, successor, to, pierre, simon, laplace, the, most, important, of, these, are, his, memoirs, sur, les, in, galit, s, s, culaires, des, moyens, mouvements, des, plan, tes, sur, la, variation, des, constantes, arbitraires, dans, les, questions, de, m, canique, both, published, in, the, journal, of, the, cole, polytechnique, 1809, sur, la, libration, de, la, lune, in, connaissance, des, temps, 1821, etc, and, sur, le, mouvement, de, la, terre, autour, de, son, centre, de, gravit, in, m, moires, de, l, acad, mie, 1827, etc, in, the, first, of, these, memoirs, poisson, discusses, the, famous, question, of, the, stability, of, the, planetary, orbits, which, had, already, been, settled, by, lagrange, to, the, first, degree, of, approximation, for, the, disturbing, forces, poisson, showed, that, the, result, could, be, extended, to, a, second, approximation, and, thus, made, an, important, advance, in, planetary, theory, the, memoir, is, remarkable, inasmuch, as, it, roused, lagrange, after, an, interval, of, inactivity, to, compose, in, his, old, age, one, of, the, greatest, of, his, memoirs, entitled, sur, la, th, orie, des, variations, des, l, ments, des, plan, tes, et, en, particulier, des, variations, des, grands, axes, de, leurs, orbites, so, highly, did, he, think, of, poisson, s, memoir, that, he, made, a, copy, of, it, with, his, own, hand, which, was, found, among, his, papers, after, his, death, poisson, made, important, contributions, to, the, theory, of, attraction, as, a, tribute, to, poisson, s, scientific, work, which, stretched, to, more, than, 300, publications, he, was, awarded, a, french, peerage, in, 1837, his, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, in, the, theory, of, potentials, poisson, s, equation, is, a, well, known, generalization, of, laplace, s, equation, of, the, second, order, partial, differential, equation, 2, 0, displaystyle, nabla, 2, phi, 0, for, potential, displaystyle, phi, if, x, y, z, displaystyle, rho, x, y, z, is, a, continuous, function, and, if, for, r, displaystyle, r, rightarrow, infty, or, if, a, point, moves, to, infinity, a, function, displaystyle, phi, goes, to, 0, fast, enough, the, solution, of, poisson, s, equation, is, the, newtonian, potential, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, a, distance, between, a, volume, element, d, v, displaystyle, dv, and, a, point, p, displaystyle, p, the, integration, runs, over, the, whole, space, poisson, s, equation, was, first, published, in, the, bulletin, de, la, soci, t, philomatique, 1813, poisson, s, two, most, important, memoirs, on, the, subject, are, sur, l, attraction, des, sph, roides, connaiss, ft, temps, 1829, and, sur, l, attraction, d, un, ellipsoide, homog, ne, mim, ft, l, acad, 1835, poisson, discovered, that, laplace, s, equation, is, valid, only, outside, of, a, solid, a, rigorous, proof, for, masses, with, variable, density, was, first, given, by, carl, friedrich, gauss, in, 1839, poisson, s, equation, is, applicable, in, not, just, gravitation, but, also, electricity, and, magnetism, as, the, eighteenth, century, came, to, a, close, human, understanding, of, electrostatics, approached, maturity, benjamin, franklin, had, already, established, the, notion, of, electric, charge, and, the, conservation, of, charge, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, had, enunciated, his, inverse, square, law, of, electrostatics, in, 1777, joseph, louis, lagrange, introduced, the, concept, of, a, potential, function, that, can, be, used, to, compute, the, gravitational, force, of, an, extended, body, in, 1812, poisson, adopted, this, idea, and, obtained, the, appropriate, expression, for, electricity, which, relates, the, potential, function, v, displaystyle, v, to, the, electric, charge, density, displaystyle, rho, poisson, s, work, on, potential, theory, inspired, george, green, s, 1828, paper, an, essay, on, the, application, of, mathematical, analysis, to, the, theories, of, electricity, and, magnetism, in, 1820, hans, christian, rsted, demonstrated, that, it, was, possible, to, deflect, a, magnetic, needle, by, closing, or, opening, an, electric, circuit, nearby, resulting, in, a, deluge, of, published, papers, attempting, to, explain, the, phenomenon, amp, re, s, law, and, the, biot, savart, law, were, quickly, deduced, the, science, of, electromagnetism, was, born, poisson, was, also, investigating, the, phenomenon, of, magnetism, at, this, time, though, he, insisted, on, treating, electricity, and, magnetism, as, separate, phenomena, he, published, two, memoirs, on, magnetism, in, 1826, by, the, 1830s, a, major, research, question, in, the, study, of, electricity, was, whether, or, not, electricity, was, a, fluid, or, fluids, distinct, from, matter, or, something, that, simply, acts, on, matter, like, gravity, coulomb, amp, re, and, poisson, thought, that, electricity, was, a, fluid, distinct, from, matter, in, his, experimental, research, starting, with, electrolysis, michael, faraday, sought, to, show, this, was, not, the, case, electricity, faraday, believed, was, a, part, of, matter, poisson, was, a, member, of, the, academic, old, guard, at, the, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, de, l, institut, de, france, who, were, staunch, believers, in, the, particle, theory, of, light, and, were, skeptical, of, its, alternative, the, wave, theory, in, 1818, the, acad, mie, set, the, topic, of, their, prize, as, diffraction, one, of, the, participants, civil, engineer, and, opticist, augustin, jean, fresnel, submitted, a, thesis, explaining, diffraction, derived, from, analysis, of, both, the, huygens, fresnel, principle, and, young, s, double, slit, experiment, poisson, studied, fresnel, s, theory, in, detail, and, looked, for, a, way, to, prove, it, wrong, poisson, thought, that, he, had, found, a, flaw, when, he, demonstrated, that, fresnel, s, theory, predicts, an, on, axis, bright, spot, in, the, shadow, of, a, circular, obstacle, blocking, a, point, source, of, light, where, the, particle, theory, of, light, predicts, complete, darkness, poisson, argued, this, was, absurd, and, fresnel, s, model, was, wrong, such, a, spot, is, not, easily, observed, in, everyday, situations, because, most, everyday, sources, of, light, are, not, good, point, sources, the, head, of, the, committee, dominique, fran, ois, jean, arago, performed, the, experiment, he, molded, a, 2, mm, metallic, disk, to, a, glass, plate, with, wax, to, everyone, s, surprise, he, observed, the, predicted, bright, spot, which, vindicated, the, wave, model, fresnel, won, the, competition, after, that, the, corpuscular, theory, of, light, was, dead, but, was, revived, in, the, twentieth, century, in, a, different, form, wave, particle, duality, arago, later, noted, that, the, diffraction, bright, spot, which, later, became, known, as, both, the, arago, spot, and, the, poisson, spot, had, already, been, observed, by, joseph, nicolas, delisle, and, giacomo, f, maraldi, a, century, earlier, in, pure, mathematics, poisson, s, most, important, works, were, his, series, of, memoirs, on, definite, integrals, and, his, discussion, of, fourier, series, the, latter, paving, the, way, for, the, classic, researches, of, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, and, bernhard, riemann, on, the, same, subject, these, are, to, be, found, in, the, journal, of, the, cole, polytechnique, from, 1813, to, 1823, and, in, the, memoirs, de, l, acad, mie, for, 1823, he, also, studied, fourier, integrals, poisson, wrote, an, essay, on, the, calculus, of, variations, mem, de, l, acad, 1833, and, memoirs, on, the, probability, of, the, mean, results, of, observations, connaiss, d, temps, 1827, c, the, poisson, distribution, in, probability, theory, is, named, after, him, in, 1820, poisson, studied, integrations, along, paths, in, the, complex, plane, becoming, the, first, person, to, do, so, in, 1829, poisson, published, a, paper, on, elastic, bodies, that, contained, a, statement, and, proof, of, a, special, case, of, what, became, known, as, the, divergence, theorem, founded, mainly, by, leonhard, euler, and, joseph, louis, lagrange, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, calculus, of, variations, saw, further, development, and, applications, in, the, nineteenth, let, s, a, b, f, x, y, x, y, x, d, x, displaystyle, s, int, limits, a, b, f, x, y, x, y, x, dx, where, y, d, y, d, x,

influenced, the, work, of, william, rowan, hamilton, and, carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, a, translation, of, poisson, s, treatise, on, mechanics, was, published, in, london, in, 1842, let, u, displaystyle, u, and, v, displaystyle, v, be, functions, of, the, canonical, variables, of, motion, q, displaystyle, q, and, p, displaystyle, p, then, their, poisson, bracket, is, given, by, u, v, u,

frac, partial, u, partial, t, moreover, poisson, s, theorem, states, the, poisson, bracket, of, any, two, constants, of, motion, is, also, a, constant, of, motion, in, september, 1925, paul, dirac, received, proofs, of, a, seminal, paper, by, werner, heisenberg, on, the, new, branch, of, physics, known, as, quantum, mechanics, soon, he, realized, that, the, key, idea, in, heisenberg, s, paper, was, the, anti, commutativity, of, dynamical, variables, and, remembered, that, the, analogous, mathematical, construction, in, classical, mechanics, was, poisson, brackets, he, found, the, treatment, he, needed, in, e, t, whittaker, s, analytical, dynamics, of, particles, and, rigid, bodies, in, 1821, using, an, analogy, with, elastic, bodies, claude, louis, navier, arrived, at, the, basic, equations, of, motion, for, viscous, fluids, now, identified, as, the, navier, stokes, equations, in, 1829, poisson, independently, obtained, the, same, result, george, gabriel, stokes, re, derived, them, in, 1845, using, continuum, mechanics, poisson, augustin, louis, cauchy, and, sophie, germain, were, the, main, contributors, to, the, theory, of, elasticity, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, calculus, of, variations, was, frequently, used, to, solve, problems, poisson, also, published, a, memoir, on, the, theory, of, waves, m, m, ft, l, acad, 1825, in, his, work, on, heat, conduction, joseph, fourier, maintained, that, the, arbitrary, function, may, be, represented, as, an, infinite, trigonometric, series, and, made, explicit, the, possibility, of, expanding, functions, in, terms, of, bessel, functions, and, legendre, polynomials, depending, on, the, context, of, the, problem, it, took, some, time, for, his, ideas, to, be, accepted, as, his, use, of, mathematics, was, less, than, rigorous, although, initially, skeptical, poisson, adopted, fourier, s, method, from, around, 1815, he, studied, various, problems, in, heat, conduction, he, published, his, th, orie, math, matique, de, la, chaleur, in, 1835, during, the, early, 1800s, pierre, simon, de, laplace, developed, a, sophisticated, if, speculative, description, of, gases, based, on, the, old, caloric, theory, of, heat, to, which, younger, scientists, such, as, poisson, were, less, committed, a, success, for, laplace, was, his, correction, of, newton, s, formula, for, the, speed, of, sound, in, air, that, gives, satisfactory, answers, when, compared, with, experiments, the, newton, laplace, formula, makes, use, of, the, specific, heats, of, gases, at, constant, volume, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, and, at, constant, pressure, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, in, 1823, poisson, redid, his, teacher, s, work, and, reached, the, same, results, without, resorting, to, complex, hypotheses, previously, employed, by, laplace, in, addition, by, using, the, gas, laws, of, robert, boyle, and, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, poisson, obtained, the, equation, for, gases, undergoing, adiabatic, changes, namely, p, v, constant, displaystyle, pv, gamma, text, constant, where, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, pressure, of, the, gas, v, displaystyle, v, its, volume, and, c, p, c, v, displaystyle, gamma, frac, c, p, c, v, besides, his, many, memoirs, poisson, published, a, number, of, treatises, most, of, which, were, intended, to, form, part, of, a, great, work, on, mathematical, physics, which, he, did, not, live, to, complete, among, these, may, be, mentioned, after, political, activist, variste, galois, had, returned, to, mathematics, after, his, expulsion, from, the, cole, normale, poisson, asked, him, to, submit, his, work, on, the, theory, of, equations, which, he, did, january, 1831, in, early, july, poisson, declared, galois, work, incomprehensible, but, encouraged, galois, to, publish, the, whole, of, his, work, in, order, to, form, a, definitive, opinion, while, poisson, s, report, was, made, before, galois, 14, july, arrest, it, took, until, october, to, reach, galois, in, prison, it, is, unsurprising, in, the, light, of, his, character, and, situation, at, the, time, that, galois, vehemently, decided, against, publishing, his, papers, through, the, academy, and, instead, publish, them, privately, through, his, friend, auguste, chevalier, yet, galois, did, not, ignore, poisson, s, advice, he, began, collecting, all, his, mathematical, manuscripts, while, still, in, prison, and, continued, polishing, his, ideas, until, his, release, on, 29, april, 1832, after, which, he, was, somehow, persuaded, to, participate, in, what, proved, to, be, a, fatal, duel
