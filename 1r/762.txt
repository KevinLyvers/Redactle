the, marriage, standards, of, the, day, i, think, marriage, is, a, very, alienating, institution, for, men, as, well, as, for, women, i, think, it, s, a, very, dangerous, institution, dangerous, for, men, who, find, themselves, trapped, saddled, with, a, wife, and, children, to, support, dangerous, for, women, who, aren, t, financially, independent, and, end, up, by, depending, on, men, who, can, throw, them, out, when, they, are, 40, and, very, dangerous, for, children, because, their, parents, vent, all, their, frustrations, and, mutual, hatred, on, them, the, very, words, conjugal, rights, are, dreadful, any, institution, which, solders, one, person, to, another, obliging, people, to, sleep, together, who, no, longer, want, to, is, a, bad, one, instead, she, and, sartre, entered, into, a, lifelong, soul, partnership, which, was, sexual, but, not, exclusive, nor, did, it, involve, living, together, she, chose, never, to, marry, and, never, had, children, this, gave, her, the, time, to, advance, her, education, and, engage, in, political, causes, write, and, teach, and, take, lovers, unfortunately, beauvoir, s, prominent, open, relationships, at, times, overshadowed, her,

those, asked, about, beauvoir, concerned, her, personal, life, sartre, and, beauvoir, always, read, each, other, s, work, debate, continues, about, the, extent, to, which, they, influenced, each, other, in, their, existentialist, works, such, as, sartre, s, being, and, nothingness, and, beauvoir, s, she, came, to, stay, and, phenomenology, and, intent, however, recent, studies, of, beauvoir, s, work, focus, on, influences, other, than, sartre, including, hegel, and, leibniz, the, neo, hegelian, revival, led, by, alexandre, koj, ve, and, jean, hyppolite, in, the, 1930s, inspired, a, whole, generation, of, french, thinkers, including, sartre, to, discover, hegel, s, phenomenology, of, spirit, however, beauvoir, reading, hegel, in, german, during, the, war, produced, an, original, critique, of, his, dialectic, of, consciousness, beauvoir, was, bisexual, and, her, relationships, with, young, women, were, controversial, french, author, bianca, lamblin, originally, bianca,

if, she, would, support, a, minimum, wage, for, women, who, do, housework, beauvoir, answered, no, we, don, t, believe, that, any, woman, should, have, this, choice, no, woman, should, be, authorized, to, stay, at, home, and, raise, her, children, society, should, be, different, women, should, not, have, that, choice, precisely, because, if, there, is, such, a, choice, too, many, women, will, make, that, one, it, is, a, way, of, forcing, women, in, a, certain, direction, further, stating, that, motherhood, should, be, a, choice, and, not, a, result, of, conditioning, in, about, 1976, beauvoir,

although, beauvoir, rejected, the, institution, of, marriage, her, entire, life, this, adoption, was, like, a, marriage, for, her, some, scholars, argue, that, this, adoption, was, not, to, secure, a, literary, heir, for, beauvoir, but, as, a, form, of, resistance, to, the, bio, heteronormative, family, unit, beauvoir, died, of, pneumonia, on, 14, april, 1986, in, paris, aged, 78, she, is, buried, next, to, sartre, at, the, montparnasse, cemetery, in, paris, she, was, honored, as, a, figure, at, the, forefront, of, the, struggle, for, women, s, rights, around, the, time, of, her, passing, the, second, sex, first, published, in, 1949, in, french, as, le, deuxi, me, sexe, turns, the, existentialist, mantra, that, existence, precedes, essence, into, a, feminist, one, one, is, not, born, but, becomes, a, woman, french, on, ne, na, t, pas, femme, on, le, devient, with, this, famous, phrase, beauvoir, first, articulated, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, sex, gender, distinction, that, is, the, distinction, between, biological, sex, and, the, social, and, historical, construction, of, gender, and, its, attendant, stereotypes, beauvoir, argues, that, the, fundamental, source, of, women, s, oppression, is, its, historical, and, social, construction, as, the, quintessential, other, beauvoir, defines, women, as, the, second, sex, because, women, are, defined, as, inferior, to, men, she, pointed, out, that, aristotle, argued, women, are, female, by, virtue, of, a, certain, lack, of, qualities, while, thomas, aquinas, referred, to, women, as, imperfect, men, and, the, incidental, being, she, quotes, in, itself, homosexuality, is, as, limiting, as, heterosexuality, the, ideal, should, be, to, be, capable, of, loving, a, woman, or, a, man, either, a, human, being, without, feeling, fear, restraint, or, obligation, beauvoir, asserted, that, women, are, as, capable, of, choice, as, men, and, thus, can, choose, to, elevate, themselves, moving, beyond, the, immanence, to, which, they, were, previously, resigned, and, reaching, transcendence, a, position, in, which, one, takes, responsibility, for, oneself, and, the, world, where, one, chooses, one, s, freedom, chapters, of, the, second, sex, were, originally, published, in, les, temps, modernes, in, june, 1949, the, second, volume, came, a, few, months, after, the, first, in, france, it, was, published, soon, after, in, america, due, to, the, quick, translation, by, howard, parshley, as, prompted, by, blanche, knopf, wife, of, publisher, alfred, a, knopf, because, parshley, had, only, a, basic, familiarity, with, the, french, language, and, a, minimal, understanding, of, philosophy, he, was, a, professor, of, biology, at, smith, college, much, of, beauvoir, s, book, was, mistranslated, or, inappropriately, cut, distorting, her, intended, message, for, years, knopf, prevented, the, introduction, of, a, more, accurate, retranslation, of, beauvoir, s, work, declining, all, proposals, despite, the, efforts, of, existentialist, scholars, only, in, 2009, was, there, a, second, translation, to, mark, the, 60th, anniversary, of, the, original, publication, constance, borde, and, sheila, malovany, chevallier, produced, the, first, integral, translation, in, 2010, reinstating, a, third, of, the, original, work, in, the, chapter, woman, myth, and, reality, of, the, second, sex, beauvoir, argued, that, men, had, made, women, the, other, in, society, by, the, application, of, a, false, aura, of, mystery, around, them, she, argued, that, men, used, this, as, an, excuse, not, to, understand, women, or, their, problems, and, not, to, help, them, and, that, this, stereotyping, was, always, done, in, societies, by, the, group, higher, in, the, hierarchy, to, the, group, lower, in, the, hierarchy, she, wrote, that, a, similar, kind, of, oppression, by, hierarchy, also, happened, in, other, categories, of, identity, such, as, race, class, and, religion, but, she, claimed, that, it, was, nowhere, more, true, than, with, gender, in, which, men, stereotyped, women, and, used, it, as, an, excuse, to, organize, society, into, a, patriarchy, despite, her, contributions, to, the, feminist, movement, especially, the, french, women, s, liberation, movement, and, her, beliefs, in, women, s, economic, independence, and, equal, education, beauvoir, was, initially, reluctant, to, call, herself, a, feminist, however, after, observing, the, resurgence, of, the, feminist, movement, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, beauvoir, stated, she, no, longer, believed, a, socialist, revolution, to, be, enough, to, bring, about, women, s, liberation, she, publicly, declared, herself, a, feminist, in, 1972, in, an, interview, with, le, nouvel, observateur, in, 2018, the, manuscript, pages, of, le, deuxi, me, sexe, were, published, at, the, time, her, adopted, daughter, sylvie, le, bon, beauvoir, a, philosophy, professor, described, her, mother, s, writing, process, beauvoir, wrote, every, page, of, her, books, longhand, first, and, only, after, that, would, hire, typists, beauvoir, published, her, first, novel, she, came, to, stay, in, 1943, it, has, been, assumed, that, it, is, inspired, by, her, and, sartre, s, sexual, relationship, with, olga, kosakiewicz, and, wanda, kosakiewicz, olga, was, one, of, her, students, in, the, rouen, secondary, school, where, beauvoir, taught, during, the, early, 1930s, she, grew, fond, of, olga, sartre, tried, to, pursue, olga, but, she, rejected, him, so, he, began, a, relationship, with, her, sister, wanda, upon, his, death, sartre, was, still, supporting, wanda, he, also, supported, olga, for, years, until, she, met, and, married, jacques, laurent, bost, a, lover, of, beauvoir, however, the, main, thrust, of, the, novel, is, philosophical, a, scene, in, which, to, situate, beauvoir, s, abiding, philosophical, pre, occupation, the, relationship, between, the, self, and, the, other, in, the, novel, set, just, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, beauvoir, creates, one, character, from, the, complex, relationships, of, olga, and, wanda, the, fictionalised, versions, of, beauvoir, and, sartre, have, a, m, nage, trois, with, the, young, woman, the, novel, also, delves, into, beauvoir, and, sartre, s, complex, relationship, and, how, it, was, affected, by, the, m, nage, trois, she, came, to, stay, was, followed, by, many, others, including, the, blood, of, others, which, explores, the, nature, of, individual, responsibility, telling, a, love, story, between, two, young, french, students, participating, in, the, resistance, in, world, war, ii, in, 1944, beauvoir, wrote, her, first, philosophical, essay, pyrrhus, et, cin, as, a, discussion, on, existentialist, ethics, she, continued, her, exploration, of, existentialism, through, her, second, essay, the, ethics, of, ambiguity, 1947, it, is, perhaps, the, most, accessible, entry, into, french, existentialism, in, the, essay, beauvoir, clears, up, some, inconsistencies, that, many, sartre, included, have, found, in, major, existentialist, works, such, as, being, and, nothingness, in, the, ethics, of, ambiguity, beauvoir, confronts, the, existentialist, dilemma, of, absolute, freedom, vs, the, constraints, of, circumstance, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, beauvoir, and, sartre, edited, les, temps, modernes, a, political, journal, that, sartre, founded, along, with, maurice, merleau, ponty, and, others, beauvoir, used, les, temps, modernes, to, promote, her, own, work, and, explore, her, ideas, on, a, small, scale, before, fashioning, essays, and, books, beauvoir, remained, an, editor, until, her, death, however, sartre, and, merleau, ponty, had, a, longstanding, feud,
