success, as, well, as, the, growth, of, his, manpower, and, wealth, tokhtamysh, next, turned, to, the, russian, principalities, although, he, did, not, necessarily, seek, a, conflict, from, the, start, similarly, the, grand, prince, of, vladimir, suzdal, dmitry, donskoy, had, recently, defeated, mamai, at, great, cost, at, kulikovo, and, was, not, looking, for, a, confrontation, as, he, would, have, had, difficulty, to, muster, a, great, army, again, he, duly, acknowledged, tokhtamysh, as, the, new, khan, and, his, suzerain, but, although, he, sent, rich, gifts, dmitrij, withheld, the, payment, of, tribute, when, tokhtamysh, s, envoy, q, khw, ja, came, to, invite, the, russian, princes, to, the, khan, s, court, for, the, confirmation, of, their, diplomas, of, investiture, he, was, faced, with, so, much, hostility, by, the, population, that, he, turned, back, after, reaching, ni, nij, novgorod, tokhtamysh, prepared, for, war, in, 1382, intending, to, catch, his, enemy, by, surprise, he, began, by, ordering, the, arrest, and, robbing, of, russian, merchants, on, the, volga, and, the, confiscation, of, their, boats, crossing, the, river, with, his, entire, army, he, attempted, to, advance, secretly, but, attracted, much, attention, seeking, to, ingratiate, himself, with, the, khan, grand, prince, oleg, ivanovi, of, rjazan, placed, himself, at, the, khan, s, disposal, pointing, out, the, fords, over, the, oka, river, grand, prince, dmitrij, konstantinovi, of, ni, nij, novgorod, also, submitted, readily, and, sent, his, sons, vasilij, and, sem, n, to, join, tokhtamysh, s, campaign, as, guides, grand, prince, dmitrij, of, moscow, did, not, submit, but, left, a, strong, garrison, in, his, capital, under, the, lithuanian, prince, ostej, and, sought, out, the, greater, safety, of, kostroma, from, where, he, hoped, to, gather, greater, forces, after, taking, serpukhov, tokhtamysh, s, forces, reached, and, besieged, moscow, on, 23, august, 1382, three, days, later, the, citizens, were, tricked, into, surrendering, by, vasilij, and, sem, n, of, ni, nij, novgorod, and, tokhtamysh, s, troops, stormed, into, the, city, slaughtering, plundering, and, finally, razing, it, for, the, insubordination, of, its, ruler, other, cities, taken, by, the, mongols, during, the, campaign, included, vladimir, zvenigorod, jur, ev, perejaslavl, zalesskij, dmitrov, kolomna, and, mo, ajsk, on, his, way, back, tokhtamysh, also, sacked, rjazan, despite, the, cooperation, of, its, prince, after, the, submission, of, the, russian, princes, and, the, resumption, of, their, tribute, tokhtamysh, adopted, more, conciliatory, policies, toward, them, dmitrij, of, moscow, razed, rjazan, in, vengeance, for, oleg, ivanovi, s, collaboration, with, tokhtamysh, against, moscow, but, suffered, no, punishment, for, it, mihail, aleksandrovi, of, tver, was, invested, as, grand, prince, of, vladimir, and, visited, tokhtamysh, s, court, with, his, son, aleksandr, but, never, succeeded, in, entering, into, possession, of, the, grand, principality, as, tokhtamysh, soon, forgave, dmitrij, of, moscow, dmitrij, had, submitted, surrendered, his, eldest, son, vasilij, dmitrievi, as, hostage, and, promised, to, pay, tribute, duly, dispatched, in, 1383, when, dmitrij, konstantinovi, of, ni, nij, novgorod, died, the, same, year, tokhtamysh, granted, that, principality, to, his, brother, boris, konstantinovi, but, gave, suzdal, to, dmitrij, s, sons, sem, n, and, vasilij, in, 1386, dmitrij, of, moscow, s, son, vasilij, hostage, at, tokhtamysh, s, court, escaped, to, moldavia, and, made, his, way, to, moscow, via, lithuania, despite, some, tension, moscow, did, not, suffer, any, consequences, on, the, contrary, when, dmitrij, left, his, son, vasilij, the, grand, principality, of, vladimir, in, his, will, in, 1389, tokhtamysh, sanctioned, it, through, his, envoy, shaykh, a, mad, sem, n, and, vasilij, of, suzdal, expelled, their, uncle, boris, from, ni, nij, novgorod, but, he, tracked, down, tokhtamysh, on, campaign, and, returned, with, a, new, investiture, from, the, khan, in, 1390, russian, recruits, subsequently, served, tokhtamysh, in, central, asia, in, 1391, tokhtamysh, sent, his, commander, beg, tut, to, ravage, vjatka, presumably, in, response, to, the, depredations, of, the, ushkuyniks, buccaneers, along, the, volga, but, the, buccaneers, launched, a, revenge, raid, on, the, area, of, bolghar, seeking, cooperation, against, this, and, other, threats, tokhtamysh, received, vasilij, i, of, moscow, in, his, camp, and, invested, him, with, the, domain, of, ni, nij, novgorod, despite, the, protests, of, its, princes, despite, his, sack, of, moscow, in, 1382, tokhtamysh, had, strengthened, the, power, and, wealth, of, its, ruler, in, the, end, helping, set, it, on, the, path, to, annexing, other, russian, and, later, mongol, polities, in, 1383, taking, advantage, of, timur, s, preoccupation, with, affairs, in, persia, tokhtamysh, restored, the, golden, horde, s, authority, over, the, semi, autonomous, f, dynasty, in, khwarazm, apparently, without, provoking, his, former, patron, under, pressure, from, his, emirs, to, provide, profitable, campaigns, for, plunder, and, perhaps, possessed, by, the, traditional, ambitions, of, his, predecessors, tokhtamysh, crossed, the, caucasus, with, a, large, force, 5, tumens, 50, 000, troops, during, the, winter, of, 1384, 1385, invading, jalayirid, azerbaijan, he, captured, the, capital, tabriz, by, storm, and, ravaged, the, neighboring, area, for, ten, days, before, retiring, with, his, plunder, including, some, 200, 000, slaves, among, them, thousands, of, armenians, from, the, districts, of, parskahayk, syunik, and, artsakh, either, to, take, advantage, of, jalayirid, weakness, or, to, preempt, the, expansion, of, the, golden, horde, into, the, area, timur, proceeded, to, conquer, azerbaijan, in, 1386, he, was, wintering, in, nearby, karabakh, in, 1386, 1387, when, tokhtamysh, crossed, the, mountains, in, the, spring, of, 1387, and, headed, straight, for, him, despite, being, taken, by, surprise, and, being, nearly, defeated, timur, s, commanders, rallied, and, succeeded, in, repelling, tokhtamysh, s, attack, with, the, help, of, timely, reinforcements, led, by, timur, s, son, m, r, n, sh, h, timur, showed, remarkable, leniency, to, the, captured, warriors, of, tokhtamysh, feeding, and, clothing, them, and, allowing, them, to, return, home, whether, this, was, a, sign, of, respect, toward, a, royal, descendant, of, chinggis, khan, or, an, attempt, to, defuse, an, unnecessary, conflict, on, an, unwanted, front, is, unclear, despite, his, defeat, and, a, subsequent, message, seeking, to, defuse, the, hostility, tokhtamysh, continued, to, provoke, his, former, protector, while, timur, remained, in, persia, in, the, winter, of, 1387, 1388, tokhtamysh, overran, central, asia, where, part, of, his, forces, besieged, sawran, while, another, crossed, khwarazm, to, besiege, bukhara, timur, s, commanders, prepared, to, defend, samarqand, and, other, towns, against, the, expected, continued, advance, of, tokhtamysh, and, timur, himself, headed, back, from, shiraz, to, samarqand, with, his, main, forces, in, february, 1388, learning, of, the, enemy, s, movements, tokhtamysh, s, forces, retreated, timur, was, now, convinced, that, a, serious, contest, with, tokhtamysh, was, inevitable, he, overthrew, the, f, dynasty, of, khwarazm, for, its, collusion, with, tokhtamysh, and, razed, to, the, ground, its, capital, old, gurg, nj, in, 1388, increasingly, aware, that, he, was, outmatched, tokhtamysh, sought, to, create, an, anti, timurid, coalition, reaching, out, to, neighboring, rulers, including, the, mamluk, sultan, barq, q, concerned, by, timur, s, power, tokhtamysh, attempted, to, take, sawran, again, in, 1388, was, driven, off, by, timur, in, the, snowy, january, of, 1389, but, made, another, attack, on, sawran, later, in, the, year, it, also, failed, but, tokhtamysh, s, forces, pillaged, the, neighborhood, and, plundered, the, town, of, yas, now, turkistan, before, retreating, to, safety, when, timur, defeated, tokhtamysh, s, vanguard, and, crossed, the, syr, darya, in, pursuit, timur, seized, sighnaq, but, then, diverted, his, attention, to, tokhtamysh, s, allies, farther, east, timur, determined, to, take, the, initiative, and, strike, decisively, into, tokhtamysh, s, core, territories, gathering, a, large, army, he, set, out, in, february, 1391, from, tashkent, ignored, tokhtamysh, s, envoys, seeking, peace, and, struck, into, the, territories, of, the, former, ulus, of, orda, but, for, four, months, of, traveling, and, hunting, timur, failed, to, catch, up, with, tokhtamysh, who, had, seemingly, retreated, northwards, only, after, reaching, the, headwaters, of, the, tobol, did, timur, discover, that, tokhtamysh, was, regrouping, to, the, west, across, the, ural, and, planning, to, defend, the, crossing, timur, advanced, on, the, ural, and, crossed, it, farther, upstream, causing, tokhtamysh, to, retreat, in, the, direction, of, the, volga, where, he, could, expect, the, arrival, of, reinforcements, from, the, crimea, bolghar, and, even, russia, determined, to, preempt, this, timur, caught, up, with, tokhtamysh, and, forced, him, to, give, battle, at, the, kondurcha, river, on, 18, june, 1391, the, hard, fought, battle, ended, in, the, rout, of, tokhtamysh, s, forces, and, his, flight, from, the, battlefield, many, of, his, soldiers, trapped, between, the, enemy, and, the, volga, were, captured, or, slaughtered, timur, and, his, victorious, army, celebrated, for, over, a, month, by, the, banks, of, the, volga, surprisingly, he, did, not, attempt, to, consolidate, his, control, over, the, area, before, heading, for, home, at, their, request, timur, left, behind, two, princes, descended, from, tuqa, timur, t, m, r, qutluq, son, of, qutluq, t, m, r, and, kunche, oghlan, t, m, r, qutluq, s, paternal, uncle, as, well, as, the, manghit, emir, edigu, t, m, r, qutluq, s, maternal, uncle, this, is, sometimes, interpreted, as, timur, s, investiture, of, t, m, r, qutluq, as, khan, but, that, seems, unlikely, the, three, were, supposed, to, recruit, additional, troop, for, the, timurid, army, only, kunche, oghlan, remained, faithful, to, his, vow, and, returned, to, timur, with, his, recruits, before, deserting, tokhtamysh, the, next, year, meanwhile, t, m, r, qutluq, and, egidu, struck, out, on, their, own, with, a, growing, following, and, appear, to, have, declared, t, m, r, qutluq, khan, in, the, left, eastern, wing, of, the, golden, horde, one, of, tokhtamysh, s, commanders, beg, p, l, d, possibly, a, grandson, of, urus, khan, who, had, escaped, from, the, battle, of, kondurcha, had, declared, himself, khan, at, sarai, in, the, expectation, that, tokhtamysh, had, perished, tokhtamysh, had, survived, and, still, commanded, sufficient, authority, and, manpower, to, strike, back, defeating, and, expelling, beg, p, l, d, from, sarai, tokhtamysh, chased, him, into, the, crimea, and, after, besieging, him, in, solkhat, finally, killed, him, another, would, be, challenger, in, the, crimea, tokhtamysh, s, second, cousin, t, sh, t, m, r, temporarily, recognized, tokhtamysh, s, rule, but, retained, some, autonomy, tokhtamysh, dealt, similarly, with, edigu, coming, to, terms, with, him, in, exchange, for, his, submission, and, leaving, him, with, autonomous, authority, in, the, east, greatly, weakening, the, position, of, t, m, r, qutluq, tokhtamysh, felt, powerful, enough, to, demand, tribute, from, the, polish, king, w, adys, aw, ii, jagie, o, in, 1393, for, the, lands, his, father, grand, duke, algirdas, of, lithuania, had, taken, from, the, golden, horde, in, the, past, his, demands, were, met, tokhtamysh, sought, to, create, an, anti, timurid, coalition, once, more, reaching, out, to, the, mamluk, sultan, barq, q, the, ottoman, sultan, bayezit, i, and, the, georgian, king, giorgi, vii, timur, retaliated, by, invading, georgia, although, he, seems, to, have, had, troubles, with, his, own, emirs, in, the, summer, of, 1394, that, autumn, tokhtamysh, was, able, to, raid, across, the, caucasus, into, shirvan, the, approach, of, timur, caused, an, immediate, retreat, timur, now, determined, that, a, second, campaign, into, the, golden, horde, was, necessary, after, some, diplomatic, dissimulation, on, both, sides, timur, set, out, with, a, great, army, towards, derbent, in, march, 1395, after, crossing, the, pass, timur, s, army, ravaged, the, area, up, to, the, terek, where, it, encountered, the, forces, of, tokhtamysh, after, timur, s, troops, destroyed, tokhtamysh, s, vanguard, the, main, battle, took, place, on, 15, 16, april, 1395, like, the, battle, on, the, kondurcha, four, year, earlier, it, was, a, hard, fought, engagement, between, nearly, equal, forces, although, timur, who, fought, like, a, common, warrior, was, nearly, captured, or, killed, he, once, again, emerged, victorious, after, a, dissension, among, tokhtamysh, s, emirs, tokhtamysh, fled, north, to, bolghar, and, later, perhaps, to, moldavia, part, of, timur, s, forces, gave, chase, catching, up, with, some, of, the, enemy, by, the, volga, and, driving, them, into, it, timur, s, local, allies, led, by, the, jochid, prince, quyurchuq, a, son, of, urus, khan, advanced, on, the, opposite, left, bank, of, the, volga, to, take, over, the, area, timur, probed, north, as, far, as, yelets, before, turning, to, ravaging, the, cities, of, the, golden, horde, at, tana, he, was, happy, to, receive, rich, gifts, from, the, italian, merchants, before, enslaving, all, christians, and, destroying, their, facilities, passing, though, circassia, he, proceeded, to, pillage, and, destroy, the, cities, along, the, volga, from, old, astrakhan, to, sarai, to, g, listan, in, the, winter, of, 1395, 1396, the, surviving, inhabitants, were, enslaved, and, driven, like, sheep, timur, set, out, for, samarkand, via, derbent, in, the, spring, of, 1396, laden, with, plunder, and, accompanied, by, herds, and, captives, including, merchants, artists, and, craftsmen, leaving, the, golden, horde, exhausted, and, pillaged, tokhtamysh, survived, timur, s, onslaught, but, his, position, was, far, more, tenuous, than, before, the, ruined, capital, sarai, was, in, the, hands, of, timur, s, prot, g, quyurchuq, while, the, area, of, astrakhan, and, the, eastern, portions, of, the, golden, horde, were, under, the, control, of, t, m, r, qutluq, and, edigu, who, had, joined, forces, once, again, they, soon, expelled, or, eliminated, quyurchuq, taking, over, sarai, in, 1396, or, 1397, but, mollified, timur, by, assuring, him, of, their, submission, through, an, embassy, in, 1398, meanwhile, tokhtamysh, had, set, about, reasserting, his, authority, in, the, southwestern, portions, of, the, golden, horde, killing, his, cousin, t, sh, t, m, r, who, had, declared, himself, khan, in, the, crimea, and, fighting, the, genoese, there, besieging, kaffa, in, 1397, in, late, 1397, or, early, 1398, tokhtamysh, briefly, triumphed, over, his, rivals, taking, over, sarai, and, the, volga, towns, and, sent, out, jubilant, missives, through, his, envoys, all,

grand, prince, vytautas, of, lithuania, vytautas, settled, tokhtamysh, and, his, followers, near, vilnius, and, trakai, although, many, of, them, abandoned, him, making, their, way, to, the, balkans, to, enter, the, service, of, the, ottoman, sultan, bayezit, i, tokhtamysh, and, vytautas, signed, a, treaty, in, which, tokhtamysh, confirmed, vytautas, as, a, rightful, ruler, of, ruthenian, lands, that, were, once, part, of, the, golden, horde, and, now, belonged, to, lithuania, and, promised, him, the, tribute, of, the, russian, principalities, in, exchange, for, military, assistance, to, recover, his, throne, possibly, the, treaty, still, stipulated, that, vytautas, would, pay, tribute, from, these, the, ruthenian, lands, once, the, khan, regained, his, throne, vytautas, was, possibly, planning, to, establish, himself, as, overlord, in, the, lands, of, the, golden, horde, t, m, r, qutluq, sent, an, envoy, to, demand, tokhtamysh, s, extradition, from, lithuania, but, received, an, ominous, answer, from, vytautas, i, will, not, give, up, tsar, tokhtamysh, but, wish, to, meet, tsar, temir, kutlu, in, person, vytautas, and, tokhtamysh, prepared, their, lithuanian, and, mongol, forces, for, a, joint, campaign, supported, by, polish, volunteers, under, spytek, of, melsztyn, in, the, summer, of, 1399, vytautas, and, tokhtamysh, set, out, against, t, m, r, qutluq, and, edigu, with, a, large, army, on, the, vorskla, river, they, encountered, the, forces, of, t, m, r, qutluq, who, opened, negotiations, intending, to, delay, the, engagement, until, edigu, could, arrive, with, reinforcements, in, the, process, t, m, r, qutluq, pretended, to, agree, to, submit, to, vytautas, and, pay, him, annual, tribute, but, requested, a, three, day, delay, to, consider, vytautas, further, demands, this, was, sufficient, for, edigu, to, arrive, with, his, reinforcements, edigu, could, not, resist, the, temptation, to, bandy, words, with, the, lithuanian, ruler, himself, and, arranged, a, meeting, separated, by, the, course, of, the, river, further, negotiations, having, proven, pointless, the, two, forces, engaged, in, the, battle, of, the, vorskla, river, on, 12, august, 1399, using, a, feigned, retreat, tactic, t, m, r, qutluq, and, edigu, were, able, to, envelop, the, forces, of, vytautas, and, tokhtamysh, inflicting, a, serious, defeat, on, them, tokhtamysh, fled, the, battlefield, and, made, his, way, east, to, sibir, vytautas, survived, the, battle, although, some, twenty, princes, including, two, of, his, cousins, fell, in, the, fight, the, defeat, was, disastrous, ending, vytautas, ambitious, policy, in, the, pontic, steppes, reduced, to, the, position, of, an, adventurer, tokhtamysh, made, his, way, across, the, territory, of, the, golden, horde, to, its, peripheral, siberian, possessions, here, he, succeeded, in, bringing, parts, of, the, area, under, his, control, in, 1400, and, by, 1405, was, attempting, to, ingratiate, himself, with, his, protector, turned, enemy, timur, who, had, just, quarreled, with, edigu, timur, s, death, in, february, 1405, made, any, rapprochement, moot, throughout, this, period, tokhtamysh, naturally, attracted, the, hostility, of, edigu, and, his, new, puppet, khan, sh, d, beg, edigu, is, said, to, have, fought, tokhtamysh, on, sixteen, separate, occasions, between, 1400, and, 1406, in, the, final, instance, after, a, reverse, at, the, hands, of, tokhtamysh, edigu, spread, a, rumor, about, his, own, death, to, draw, tokhtamysh, out, into, the, open, and, have, him, killed, in, a, hail, of, darts, and, spears, late, in, 1406, near, tyumen, khan, sh, d, beg, apparently, claimed, or, was, given, credit, for, the, death, of, tokhtamysh, while, others, credited, edigu, or, edigu, s, son, n, r, ad, d, n, russian, chroniclers, recorded, his, death, in, 1406, that, same, winter, tsar, shadi, beg, killed, tokhtamysh, in, the, siberian, lands, near, tyumen, and, he, himself, sat, on, the, horde, when, he, reunified, the, golden, horde, in, 1380, 1381, tokhtamysh, promised, to, revitalize, and, stabilize, it, after, two, decades, of, chronic, civil, war, he, was, the, last, khan, of, the, golden, horde, who, minted, coins, with, mongolian, script, his, sack, of, moscow, in, 1382, undid, the, setback, suffered, by, the, golden, horde, in, its, domination, over, the, russian, principalities, at, the, battle, of, kulikovo, two, years, earlier, finally, the, invasion, of, azerbaijan, followed, in, the, path, of, the, aspirations, of, earlier, khans, for, the, exploitation, or, conquest, of, that, region, in, 1385, tokhtamysh, was, at, the, height, of, his, power, and, his, future, as, well, as, that, of, the, golden, horde, looked, bright, however, in, entering, into, and, exacerbating, the, conflict, with, his, former, protector, timur, tokhtamysh, set, a, course, for, the, undoing, of, all, his, achievements, and, for, his, own, destruction, seeking, allies, after, he, had, weakened, moscow, he, strengthened, it, with, the, concession, of, making, the, grand, principality, of, vladimir, a, hereditary, possession, of, the, prince, of, moscow, in, 1389, and, by, allowing, it, to, take, over, ni, nij, novgorod, in, 1393, similarly, he, helped, lithuania, establish, a, precedent, for, involving, itself, in, the, government, and, politics, of, the, golden, horde, and, making, and, unmaking, khans, several, of, them, tokhtamysh, s, sons, for, decades, to, come, neither, of, these, alliances, saved, tokhtamysh, whose, authority, was, dealt, severe, setbacks, by, the, two, great, invasions, of, timur, into, the, core, territories, of, the, golden, horde, in, 1391, and, 1395, 1396, these, left, tokhtamysh, competing, with, rival, khans, ultimately, driving, him, out, definitively, and, hounding, him, to, his, death, in, sibir, in, 1406, tokhtamysh, s, relative, solidification, of, the, khan, s, authority, survived, him, only, briefly, and, largely, due, to, the, influence, of, his, nemesis, edigu, but, after, 1411, it, gave, way, to, another, long, period, of, civil, war, that, ended, in, the, disintegration, of, the, golden, horde, moreover, timur, s, destruction, of, the, golden, horde, s, main, urban, centers, as, well, as, the, italian, colony, of, tana, dealt, a, severe, and, lasting, blow, to, the,
