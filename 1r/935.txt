byzantine, christian, theologians, and, missionaries, for, their, work, evangelizing, the, slavs, they, are, known, as, the, apostles, to, the, slavs, they, are, credited, with, devising, the, glagolitic, alphabet, the, first, alphabet, used, to, transcribe, old, church, slavonic, after, their, deaths, their, pupils, continued, their, missionary, work, among, other, slavs, both, brothers, are, venerated, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, as, saints, with, the, title, of, equal, to, apostles, in, 1880, pope, leo, xiii, introduced, their, feast, into, the, calendar, of, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, in, 1980, the, first, slav, pope, pope, john, paul, ii, declared, them, co, patron, saints, of, europe, together, with, benedict, of, nursia, the, two, brothers, were, born, in, thessalonica, at, that, time, in, the, byzantine, province, of, the, same, name, today, in, greece, cyril, in, 827, 828, and, methodius, in, 815, 820, according, to, the, vita, cyrilli, the, life, of, cyril, cyril, was, reputedly, the, youngest, of, seven, brothers, he, was, born, constantine, but, was, given, the, name, cyril, upon, becoming, a, monk, in, rome, shortly, before, his, death, methodius, was, born, michael, and, was, given, the, name, methodius, upon, becoming, a, monk, in, polychron, monastery, at, mysian, olympus, present, day, uluda, in, northwest, turkey, their, father, was, leo, a, droungarios, of, the, byzantine, theme, of, thessalonica, and, their, mother, s, name, was, maria, the, exact, ethnic, origins, of, the, brothers, are, unknown, there, is, controversy, as, to, whether, cyril, and, methodius, were, of, slavic, or, greek, origin, or, both, the, two, brothers, lost, their, father, when, cyril, was, fourteen, and, the, powerful, minister, theoktistos, who, was, logothetes, tou, dromou, one, of, the, chief, ministers, of, the, empire, became, their, protector, he, was, also, responsible, along, with, the, regent, bardas, for, initiating, a, far, reaching, educational, program, within, the, empire, which, culminated, in, the, establishment, of, the, university, of, magnaura, where, cyril, was, to, teach, cyril, was, ordained, as, priest, some, time, after, his, education, while, his, brother, methodius, remained, a, deacon, until, 867, 868, about, the, year, 860, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, and, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, photius, a, professor, of, cyril, s, at, the, university, and, his, guiding, light, in, earlier, years, sent, cyril, on, a, missionary, expedition, to, the, khazars, who, had, requested, a, scholar, be, sent, to, them, who, could, converse, with, both, jews, and, saracens, it, has, been, claimed, that, methodius, accompanied, cyril, on, the, mission, to, the, khazars, but, this, may, be, a, later, invention, the, account, of, his, life, presented, in, the, latin, legenda, claims, that, he, learned, the, khazar, language, while, in, chersonesos, in, taurica, today, crimea, after, his, return, to, constantinople, cyril, assumed, the, role, of, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, his, brother, had, by, this, time, become, a, significant, figure, in, byzantine, political, and, administrative, affairs, and, an, abbot, of, his, monastery, in, 862, the, brothers, began, the, work, which, would, give, them, their, historical, importance, that, year, prince, rastislav, of, great, moravia, requested, that, emperor, michael, iii, and, the, patriarch, photius, send, missionaries, to, evangelize, his, slavic, subjects, his, motives, in, doing, so, were, probably, more, political, than, religious, rastislav, had, become, king, with, the, support, of, the, frankish, ruler, louis, the, german, though, he, subsequently, sought, to, assert, his, independence, from, the, franks, that, cyril, and, methodius, might, have, been, the, first, to, bring, christianity, to, moravia, is, a, common, misconception, rastislav, s, letter, to, michael, iii, states, clearly, that, his, people, had, already, rejected, paganism, and, adhere, to, the, christian, law, rastislav, is, said, to, have, expelled, missionaries, of, the, roman, church, and, instead, turned, to, constantinople, for, ecclesiastical, assistance, and, presumably, a, degree, of, political, support, the, emperor, quickly, chose, to, send, cyril, accompanied, by, his, brother, methodius, the, request, provided, a, convenient, opportunity, to, expand, byzantine, influence, their, first, work, seems, to, have, been, the, training, of, assistants, in, 863, they, began, the, task, of, translating, the, gospels, and, essential, liturgical, books, into, what, is, now, known, as, old, church, slavonic, and, travelled, to, great, moravia, to, promote, it, this, endeavour, was, amply, rewarded, however, they, came, into, conflict, with, german, ecclesiastics, who, opposed, their, efforts, to, create, a, specifically, slavic, liturgy, for, the, purpose, of, this, mission, they, devised, the, glagolitic, alphabet, the, first, alphabet, to, be, used, for, slavonic, manuscripts, the, glagolitic, alphabet, was, suited, to, match, the, specific, features, of, the, slavic, language, its, descendant, script, the, cyrillic, is, still, used, by, many, languages, today, the, brothers, wrote, the, first, slavic, civil, code, which, was, used, in, great, moravia, the, language, derived, from, old, church, slavonic, known, as, church, slavonic, is, still, used, in, the, liturgy, by, several, orthodox, churches, and, also, in, some, eastern, catholic, churches, exactly, how, much, the, brothers, translated, is, impossible, to, say, for, certain, the, new, testament, and, the, psalms, seem, to, have, been, the, first, followed, by, other, lessons, from, the, old, testament, the, translatio, speaks, only, of, a, version, of, the, gospels, by, cyril, and, the, vita, methodii, only, of, the, evangelium, slovenicum, though, other, liturgical, selections, may, also, have, been, translated, nor, is, it, known, for, sure, which, liturgy, whether, of, rome, or, of, constantinople, they, took, as, a, source, they, may, well, have, used, the, roman, alphabet, as, hinted, by, liturgical, fragments, adhering, closely, to, the, latin, type, this, view, is, confirmed, by, the, prague, fragments, and, by, certain, old, glagolitic, liturgical, fragments, brought, from, jerusalem, to, kyiv, and, discovered, there, by, izmail, sreznevsky, probably, the, oldest, document, in, the, slavonic, tongue, examples, of, where, they, resemble, the, latin, type, include, the, words, mass, preface, and, the, name, of, one, felicitas, regardless, the, circumstances, were, such, that, the, brothers, could, have, hoped, for, no, lasting, success, without, having, had, authorization, from, rome, the, mission, of, constantine, and, methodius, had, great, success, among, slavs, in, part, because, they, used, the, people, s, native, language, rather, than, latin, or, greek, in, great, moravia, constantine, and, methodius, also, encountered, missionaries, from, east, francia, they, would, have, represented, the, western, or, latin, branch, of, the, church, more, particularly, epitomizing, the, carolingian, empire, as, founded, by, charlemagne, and, intent, on, linguistic, and, cultural, uniformity, they, insisted, on, the, use, of, the, latin, liturgy, and, they, regarded, moravia, and, the, slavic, peoples, as, part, of, their, rightful, mission, field, when, friction, developed, the, brothers, unwilling, to, be, a, cause, of, dissension, among, christians, decided, to, travel, to, rome, to, see, the, pope, and, seek, a, solution, that, would, avoid, quarrelling, between, missionaries, in, the, field, in, 867, pope, nicholas, i, 858, 867, invited, the, brothers, to, rome, their, evangelizing, mission, in, moravia, had, by, this, time, become, the, focus, of, a, dispute, with, archbishop, adalwin, of, salzburg, 859, 873, and, bishop, ermanrich, of, passau, 866, 874, they, claimed, ecclesiastical, control, of, the, same, territory, and, wished, to, see, it, use, the, latin, liturgy, exclusively, with, them, they, brought, the, relics, of, saint, clement, and, a, retinue, of, disciples, they, passed, through, pannonia, the, balaton, principality, where, they, were, well, received, by, prince, koce, this, activity, in, pannonia, made, a, continuation, of, conflicts, inevitable, with, the, german, episcopate, and, especially, with, the, bishop, of, salzburg, whose, prerogative, pannonia, had, been, for, seventy, five, years, as, early, as, 865, bishop, adalwin, was, found, to, exercise, episcopal, rights, there, the, administration, under, him, was, in, the, hands, of, the, archpriest, riehbald, he, was, obliged, to, retire, to, salzburg, though, his, superior, was, instinctively, disinclined, to, abandon, his, claim, the, brothers, sought, support, from, rome, and, arrived, there, in, 868, where, they, were, warmly, received, this, was, partly, due, to, their, bringing, with, them, the, relics, of, saint, clement, rivalry, with, constantinople, over, the, territory, of, the, slavs, would, have, inclined, rome, to, value, the, brothers, and, their, influence, the, brothers, were, praised, for, their, learning, and, cultivated, for, their, influence, in, constantinople, anastasius, bibliothecarius, would, later, call, cyril, a, man, of, apostolic, life, and, a, man, of, great, wisdom, their, project, in, moravia, found, support, from, the, new, pope, adrian, ii, 867, 872, who, formally, authorized, the, use, of, the, new, slavic, liturgy, subsequently, methodius, was, ordained, as, priest, by, the, pope, himself, and, five, slavic, disciples, were, ordained, as, priests, saint, gorazd, saint, clement, of, ohrid, and, saint, naum, and, as, deacons, saint, angelar, and, saint, sava, by, the, prominent, bishops, formosus, and, gauderic, since, the, 10th, century, cyril, and, methodius, along, with, these, five, disciples, are, collectively, venerated, by, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, as, the, seven, saints, the, newly, made, priests, officiated, in, their, own, language, at, the, altars, of, some, of, the, principal, churches, feeling, his, end, approaching, cyril, was, tonsured, a, monk, and, given, the, name, cyril, he, died, in, rome, fifty, days, later, 14, february, 869, there, is, some, question, whether, he, had, been, made, a, bishop, as, is, asserted, in, the, translatio, ix, upon, cyril, s, death, methodius, was, given, the, title, of, archbishop, of, sirmium, now, sremska, mitrovica, in, serbia, with, jurisdiction, over, all, of, moravia, and, pannonia, and, authority, to, use, the, slavonic, liturgy, the, statement, of, the, vita, that, methodius, was, made, bishop, in, 870, and, not, raised, to, the, dignity, of, an, archbishop, until, 873, is, contradicted, by, the, brief, of, pope, john, viii, written, in, june, 879, according, to, which, adrian, consecrated, him, archbishop, john, includes, in, his, jurisdiction, not, only, great, moravia, and, pannonia, but, serbia, as, well, methodius, now, continued, the, work, among, the, slavs, alone, not, at, first, in, great, moravia, but, in, pannonia, in, the, balaton, principality, political, circumstances, in, greater, moravia, were, insecure, rastislav, had, been, taken, captive, by, his, nephew, svatopluk, in, 870, then, delivered, over, to, carloman, of, bavaria, and, condemned, in, a, diet, held, at, regensburg, at, the, end, of, 870, meanwhile, the, east, frankish, rulers, and, their, bishops, decided, to, try, and, depose, methodius, the, archiepiscopal, claims, of, methodius, were, considered, so, threatening, to, the, rights, of, salzburg, that, he, was, captured, and, forced, to, answer, to, east, frankish, bishops, adalwin, of, salzburg, ermanrich, of, passau, and, anno, of, freising, after, heated, discussion, they, declared, the, intruder, deposed, and, ordered, him, to, be, sent, to, germany, there, he, was, kept, prisoner, in, a, monastery, for, two, and, a, half, years, notwithstanding, strong, representations, of, the, conversio, bagoariorum, et, carantanorum, written, in, 871, to, influence, the, pope, though, not, conceding, this, purpose, rome, declared, emphatically, for, methodius, he, sent, a, bishop, paul, of, ancona, to, reinstate, him, and, punish, his, enemies, after, which, both, parties, were, ordered, to, appear, in, rome, with, the, legate, thus, in, 873, new, pope, john, viii, 872, 882, secured, the, release, of, methodius, but, instructed, him, to, stop, using, the, slavonic, liturgy, the, papal, will, prevailed, and, methodius, secured, his, freedom, and, his, archiepiscopal, authority, over, both, great, moravia, and, pannonia, albeit, without, the, use, of, slavonic, for, mass, in, the, catholic, church, his, authority, in, pannonia, was, restricted, after, koce, s, death, when, the, principality, was, administered, by, german, nobles, however, svatopluk, now, ruled, practically, independently, in, great, moravia, and, he, expelled, the, german, clergy, it, seems, this, secured, an, undisturbed, field, of, operation, for, methodius, and, the, vita, x, depicts, the, next, few, years, 873, 879, as, a, time, of, fruitful, progress, methodius, seems, to, have, disregarded, wholly, or, in, part, the, prohibition, of, the, slavonic, liturgy, when, frankish, clerics, again, ventured, into, the, country, revealing, a, permissive, svatopluk, at, odds, with, his, punctilious, archbishop, this, was, made, a, cause, of, complaint, against, him, at, rome, coupled, with, charges, regarding, the, filioque, in, 878, methodius, was, summoned, to, rome, on, charges, of, heresy, and, using, slavonic, this, time, pope, john, was, convinced, by, the, arguments, that, methodius, made, in, his, defence, and, sent, him, back, cleared, of, all, charges, and, with, permission, to, use, slavonic, the, carolingian, bishop, who, succeeded, him, wiching, a, swabian, suppressed, the, slavonic, liturgy, and, forced, the, followers, of, methodius, into, exile, many, found, refuge, with, knyaz, boris, the, baptizer, in, bulgaria, under, whom, they, reorganized, a, slavic, speaking, church, meanwhile, pope, john, s, successors, adopted, a, latin, only, policy, which, lasted, for, centuries, methodius, vindicated, his, orthodoxy, and, promised, to, obey, with, regard, to, the, liturgy, he, could, the, more, easily, defend, his, omission, of, filioque, from, the, creed, as, this, also, pertained, in, rome, at, the, time, though, filioque, could, by, the, 6th, century, be, heard, in, some, latin, speaking, churches, in, the, west, it, was, not, to, be, until, 1014, that, rome, followed, suit, see, nicene, creed, methodius, critics, were, mollified, by, methodius, having, to, accept, the, appointment, of, wiching, as, his, coadjutor, when, relations, between, the, two, factions, again, became, strained, john, viii, steadfastly, supported, methodius, after, his, death, december, 882, it, was, the, archbishop, himself, whose, position, looked, insecure, his, need, for, political, support, visiting, the, eastern, emperor, inclined, goetz, to, accept, the, account, in, the, vita, xiii, after, methodius, died, on, 6, april, 885, animosity, erupted, into, open, conflict, gorazd, whom, methodius, had, designated, as, his, successor, was, not, recognised, by, pope, stephen, v, this, pope, now, also, forbade, the, slavic, liturgy, and, placed, as, methodius, successor, the, infamous, wiching, he, promptly, sent, disciples, of, cyril, and, methodius, into, exile, from, great, moravia, they, fled, to, the, first, bulgarian, empire, to, be, welcomed, and, commissioned, to, establish, two, theological, schools, the, ohrid, literary, school, in, ohrid, and, the, preslav, literary, school, in, preslav, this, had, been, originally, established, in, pliska, but, was, moved, in, 893, in, preslav, the, cyrillic, script, was, devised, from, the, greek, and, glagolitic, alphabets, cyrillic, gradually, replaced, glagolitic, as, the, alphabet, of, the, old, church, slavonic, language, which, became, the, official, language, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, and, later, spread, to, the, eastern, slav, lands, of, kievan, rus, cyrillic, eventually, spread, throughout, most, of, the, slavic, world, to, become, the, standard, alphabet, in, the, eastern, orthodox, slavic, countries, in, this, way, the, work, of, cyril, and, methodius, and, their, disciples, enabled, the, spread, of, christianity, throughout, eastern, europe, methodius, body, was, buried, in, the, main, cathedral, church, of, great, moravia, it, still, remains, an, open, question, which, city, was, capital, of, great, moravia, as, a, result, the, location, of, methodius, remains, remains, uncertain, the, glagolitic, and, cyrillic, alphabets, are, the, oldest, known, slavic, alphabets, and, were, created, by, the, two, brothers, and, or, their, students, to, translate, the, gospels, and, liturgical, books, into, the, slavic, languages, the, early, glagolitic, alphabet, was, used, in, great, moravia, between, 863, the, arrival, of, cyril, and, methodius, and, 885, the, expulsion, of, their, students, for, government, and, religious, documents, and, books, and, at, the, great, moravian, academy, ve, komoravsk, u, ili, te, founded, by, cyril, where, followers, of, cyril, and, methodius, were, educated, by, methodius, himself, among, others, the, alphabet, has, been, traditionally, attributed, to, cyril, that, seems, confirmed, explicitly, by, the, papal, letter, industriae, tuae, 880, approving, the, use, of, old, church, slavonic, which, says, that, the, alphabet, was, invented, by, constantine, the, philosopher, invention, need, not, exclude, the, brothers, having, possibly, made, use, of, earlier, letterforms, before, that, time, the, slavic, languages, had, no, distinct, script, of, their, own, the, early, cyrillic, alphabet, was, developed, by, the, disciples, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, at, the, preslav, literary, school, previously, in, pliska, as, pliska, literary, school, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, as, a, simplification, of, the, glagolitic, alphabet, which, more, closely, resembled, the, greek, alphabet, after, the, death, of, cyril, clement, of, ohrid, accompanied, methodius, from, rome, to, pannonia, and, great, moravia, after, the, death, of, methodius, in, 885, clement, headed, the, struggle, against, the, german, clergy, in, great, moravia, along, with, gorazd, after, spending, some, time, in, jail, he, was, expelled, from, great, moravia, and, in, 885, or, 886, reached, the, borders, of, the, bulgarian, empire, together, with, naum, angelar, and, possibly, gorazd, other, sources, suggest, gorazd, had, already, died, by, that, time, clement, and, naum, were, afterwards, sent, to, the, bulgarian, capital, of, pliska, where, they, were, commissioned, by, boris, i, to, instruct, the, future, clergy, of, the, state, in, the, slavonic, language, after, the, adoption, of, christianity, in, 865, religious, ceremonies, in, bulgaria, were, conducted, in, greek, by, clergy, sent, from, the, byzantine, empire, fearing, growing, byzantine, influence, and, weakening, of, the, state, boris, viewed, the, adoption, of, the, old, slavonic, language, as, a, way, to, preserve, the, political, independence, and, stability, of, bulgaria, so, he, established, two, literary, schools, academies, in, pliska, and, ohrid, where, theology, was, to, be, taught, in, the, slavonic, language, while, naum, of, preslav, stayed, in, pliska, working, on, the, foundation, of, the, pliska, literary, school, clement, was, commissioned, by, boris, i, to, organise, the, teaching, of, theology, to, future, clergymen, in, old, church, slavonic, at, the, ohrid, literary, school, over, seven, years, 886, 893, clement, taught, some, 3, 500, students, in, the, slavonic, language, and, the, glagolitic, alphabet, compared, to, nowadays, the, process, leading, to, canonization, was, less, involved, in, the, decades, following, cyril, s, death, cyril, was, regarded, by, his, disciples, as, a, saint, soon, after, his, death, his, following, spread, among, the, nations, he, evangelized, and, subsequently, to, the, wider, christian, church, with, his, brother, methodius, he, was, famous, as, a, man, of, holiness, from, the, crowds, lining, the, roman, streets, during, his, funeral, procession, there, were, calls, for, cyril, to, be, accorded, saintly, status, the, brothers, first, appearance, in, a, papal, document, is, in, grande, munus, of, leo, xiii, in, 1880, they, are, known, as, the, apostles, of, the, slavs, and, are, still, highly, regarded, by, both, roman, catholic, and, orthodox, christians, their, feast, day, is, currently, celebrated, on, 14, february, in, the, roman, catholic, church, to, coincide, with, the, date, of, st, cyril, s, death, on, 11, may, in, the, eastern,
