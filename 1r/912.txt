was, satisfied, with, lecturing, in, his, bet, ha, midrash, to, a, few, chosen, pupils, whom, he, initiated, into, his, methods, he, taught, them, hebrew, grammar, hebrew, bible, and, mishna, subjects, that, were, largely, neglected, by, the, talmudists, of, that, time, he, was, especially, anxious, to, introduce, them, to, the, study, of, midrash, literature, and, the, minor, treatises, of, the, talmud, which, were, very, little, known, by, the, scholars, of, his, time, he, laid, special, stress, on, the, study, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, which, had, been, almost, entirely, neglected, for, centuries, the, gaon, encouraged, his, chief, pupil, rabbi, chaim, of, volozhin, to, found, a, yeshiva, rabbinic, academy, in, which, rabbinic, literature, should, be, taught, rabbi, chaim, volozhin, opened, the, volozhin, yeshiva, in, 1803, a, few, years, after, the, gaon, s, death, and, revolutionized, torah, study, with, resulting, impact, on, all, of, orthodox, jewry, the, vilna, gaon, led, an, ascetic, life, being, called, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, the, hasid, this, term, meaning, pious, person, and, has, no, relevance, to, the, hasidic, movement, the, gaon, once, started, on, a, trip, to, the, land, of, israel, but, for, unknown, reasons, did, not, get, beyond, germany, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, three, groups, of, his, students, known, as, perushim, under, the, leadership, of, rabbi, menachem, mendel, of, shklov, made, their, way, to, what, was, then, ottoman, palestine, settling, first, in, safed, and, later, also, in, jerusalem, while, at, k, nigsberg, he, wrote, to, his, family, a, famous, letter, that, was, published, under, the, title, alim, li, terufah, minsk, 1836, the, vilna, gaon, was, a, copious, annotator, producing, many, marginal, glosses, notes, and, brief, commentaries, which, were, mostly, dictated, to, his, pupils, many, maintain, that, it, was, his, disciples, who, recorded, his, comments, if, not, his, editorial, notes, however, nothing, of, his, was, published, in, his, lifetime, the, gra, was, very, precise, in, the, wording, of, his, commentaries, because, he, maintained, that, he, was, obligated, by, torah, law, that, only, the, torah, shebichtav, the, written, law, is, permitted, to, be, written, down, the, rest, of, torah, sheb, al, peh, oral, law, cannot, be, unless, circumstances, require, this, further, supports, the, view, that, it, was, his, disciples, who, wrote, his, comments, so, the, vilna, gaon, abided, by, this, view, of, law, by, reducing, his, extensive, explanations, that, are, largely, inscrutable, to, any, but, advanced, talmudists, glosses, on, the, babylonian, talmud, and, shulchan, aruch, are, known, as, bi, urei, ha, gra, elaborations, by, the, gra, his, running, commentary, on, the, mishnah, is, titled, shenoth, eliyahu, the, years, of, elijah, various, kabbalistic, works, have, commentaries, in, his, name, his, insights, on, the, pentateuch, are, titled, adereth, eliyahu, the, splendor, of, elijah, commentaries, on, the, proverbs, and, other, books, of, the, tanakh, were, written, later, on, in, his, life, he, was, well, versed, in, the, mathematical, works, of, euclid, 4th, century, bc, and, encouraged, his, pupil, rabbi, baruch, schick, of, shklov, to, translate, these, works, into, hebrew, the, gaon, is, said, to, have, written, a, concise, mathematical, work, called, ayil, meshulash, which, was, an, introductory, primer, to, basic, mathematics, he, was, one, of, the, most, influential, rabbinic, authorities, since, the, middle, ages, and, although, he, is, properly, an, acharon, many, later, authorities, hold, him, as, possessing, halachic, authority, in, the, same, class, as, the, rishonim, rabbinic, authorities, of, the, middle, ages, his, main, student, rabbi, chaim, volozhin, founded, the, first, yeshiva, in, his, home, town, of, volozhin, belarus, the, results, of, this, move, is, claimed, to, have, revolutionized, torah, study, by, departing, from, the, centuries, of, informal, study, youth, and, scholars, would, congregate, in, local, synagogues, and, study, freely, although, it, was, customary, to, migrate, to, towns, possessing, great, scholars, as, the, local, rabbi, the, volozhin, yeshivah, created, a, formal, structure, of, the, study, by, providing, qualified, faculty, meals, and, accommodation, the, results, of, this, process, are, currently, the, norm, in, orthodox, jewry, somewhat, ironically, viewed, from, a, traditional, light, the, leaders, of, the, haskalah, movement, used, the, study, methods, of, the, vilna, gaon, to, gain, adherents, to, their, movement, maskilim, valued, and, adapted, his, emphasis, on, peshat, over, pilpul, his, engagement, with, and, mastery, of, hebrew, grammar, and, bible, and, his, interest, in, textual, criticism, of, rabbinic, texts, further, developing, the, philosophy, of, their, movement, as, for, the, vilna, gaon, s, own, community, in, accordance, with, the, vilna, gaon, s, wishes, three, groups, of, his, disciples, and, their, families, numbering, over, 500, made, aliyah, to, the, land, of, israel, between, 1808, and, 1812, this, immigration, was, one, of, the, first, modern, jewish, migrations, to, palestine, although, hasidic, immigration, was, already, active, in, the, 1780s, even, by, the, rebbes, themselves, such, as, the, elderly, menachem, mendel, of, vitebsk, and, chaim, chaykl, of, amdur, the, disciples, of, the, vilna, gaon, known, as, perushim, due, to, how, they, isolated, themselves, from, worldly, concerns, to, study, torah, originally, settled, in, safed, because, the, muslim, authorities, in, jerusalem, prevented, ashkenazi, jews, from, settling, there, however, after, numerous, devastating, calamities, in, the, region, including, plague, and, earthquake, most, of, the, disciples, moved, to, jerusalem, their, arrival, in, jerusalem, which, for, over, 100, years, had, been, mainly, sephardi, revived, the, presence, of, ashkenazi, jewry, in, jerusalem, and, resulted, in, a, dominance, of, the, customs, of, the, vilna, gaon, the, impact, of, the, perushim, is, still, apparent, today, in, the, religious, practices, of, the, israeli, jewish, community, even, among, non, ashkenazim, for, example, the, institution, of, the, priestly, blessing, by, the, kohanim, known, as, duchaning, during, the, weekdays, rather, than, only, during, festivals, as, practiced, in, the, diaspora, and, the, accepted, time, for, the, onset, of, shabbat, in, jerusalem, and, other, cities, can, both, be, traced, to, the, custom, of, the, vilna, gaon, however, the, teachings, and, traditions, of, the, vilna, gaon, have, been, passed, down, most, directly, to, the, litvaks, in, israel, the, perushim, also, set, up, several, kollels, founded, the, jerusalem, neighborhood, of, mea, shearim, and, were, instrumental, in, rebuilding, the, yehudah, hechassid, synagogue, also, known, as, the, hurba, synagogue, or, the, ruins, which, had, lain, in, ruins, for, 140, years, there, is, a, statue, of, the, vilna, gaon, and, a, street, named, after, him, in, vilnius, the, place, of, both, his, birth, and, his, death, lithuania, s, parliament, declared, 2020, as, the, year, of, the, vilna, gaon, and, lithuanian, jewish, history, in, his, honour, the, bank, of, lithuania, issued, a, limited, edition, silver, commemorative, 10, euro, coin, in, october, 2020, this, is, the, first, euro, coin, with, hebrew, letters, the, vilna, gaon, s, brother, avraham, authored, the, revered, work, maalot, hatorah, his, son, abraham, was, also, a, scholar, of, note, the, vilna, gaon, died, in, 1797, aged, 77, and, was, subsequently, buried, in, the, nipi, k, s,
