maximilian, i, 22, march, 1459, 12, january, 1519, was, king, of, the, romans, from, 1486, and, holy, roman, emperor, from, 1508, until, his, death, in, 1519, he, was, never, crowned, by, the, pope, as, the, journey, to, rome, was, blocked, by, the, venetians, he, proclaimed, himself, elected, emperor, in, 1508, pope, julius, ii, later, recognized, this, at, trent, thus, breaking, the, long, tradition, of, requiring, a, papal, coronation, for, the, adoption, of, the, imperial, title, maximilian, was, the, only, surviving, son, of, frederick, iii, holy, roman, emperor, and, eleanor, of, portugal, since, his, coronation, as, king, of, the, romans, in, 1486, he, ran, a, double, government, or, doppelregierung, with, a, separate, court, with, his, father, until, frederick, s, death, in, 1493, maximilian, expanded, the, influence, of, the, house, of, habsburg, through, war, and, his, marriage, in, 1477, to, mary, of, burgundy, the, ruler, of, the, burgundian, state, heiress, of, charles, the, bold, though, he, also, lost, his, family, s, original, lands, in, today, s, switzerland, to, the, swiss, confederacy, through, the, marriage, of, his, son, philip, the, handsome, to, eventual, queen, joanna, of, castile, in, 1496, maximilian, helped, to, establish, the, habsburg, dynasty, in, spain, which, allowed, his, grandson, charles, to, hold, the, thrones, of, both, castile, and, aragon, the, historian, thomas, a, brady, jr, describes, him, as, the, first, holy, roman, emperor, in, 250, years, who, ruled, as, well, as, reigned, and, also, the, ablest, royal, warlord, of, his, generation, nicknamed, coeur, d, acier, heart, of, steel, by, olivier, de, la, marche, and, later, historians, either, as, praise, for, his, courage, and, soldierly, qualities, or, reproach, for, his, ruthlessness, as, a, warlike, ruler, maximilian, has, entered, the, public, consciousness, at, least, in, the, german, speaking, world, as, the, last, knight, der, letzte, ritter, especially, since, the, eponymous, poem, by, anastasius, gr, n, was, published, although, the, nickname, likely, existed, even, in, maximilian, s, lifetime, scholarly, debates, still, discuss, whether, he, was, truly, the, last, knight, either, as, an, idealized, medieval, ruler, leading, people, on, horseback, or, a, don, quixote, type, dreamer, and, misadventurer, or, the, first, renaissance, prince, an, amoral, machiavellian, politician, who, carried, his, family, to, the, european, pinnacle, of, dynastic, power, largely, on, the, back, of, loans, historians, of, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, like, leopold, von, ranke, tended, to, criticize, maximilian, for, putting, the, interest, of, his, dynasty, above, that, of, germany, hampering, the, nation, s, unification, process, ever, since, hermann, wiesflecker, s, kaiser, maximilian, i, das, reich, sterreich, und, europa, an, der, wende, zur, neuzeit, 1971, 1986, became, the, standard, work, a, much, more, positive, image, of, the, emperor, has, emerged, he, is, seen, as, an, essentially, modern, innovative, ruler, who, carried, out, important, reforms, and, promoted, significant, cultural, achievements, even, if, the, financial, price, weighed, hard, on, the, austrians, and, his, military, expansion, caused, the, deaths, and, sufferings, of, tens, of, thousands, of, people, through, an, unprecedented, image, building, program, with, the, help, of, many, notable, scholars, and, artists, in, his, lifetime, the, emperor, the, promoter, coordinator, and, prime, mover, an, artistic, impresario, and, entrepreneur, with, seemingly, limitless, energy, and, enthusiasm, and, an, unfailing, eye, for, detail, had, built, for, himself, a, virtual, royal, self, of, a, quality, that, historians, call, unmatched, or, hitherto, unimagined, to, this, image, new, layers, have, been, added, by, the, works, of, later, artists, in, the, centuries, following, his, death, both, as, continuation, of, deliberately, crafted, images, developed, by, his, program, as, well, as, development, of, spontaneous, sources, and, exploration, of, actual, historical, events, creating, what, elaine, tennant, dubs, the, maximilian, industry, maximilian, was, born, at, wiener, neustadt, on, 22, march, 1459, his, father, frederick, iii, holy, roman, emperor, named, him, for, an, obscure, saint, maximilian, of, tebessa, who, frederick, believed, had, once, warned, him, of, imminent, peril, in, a, dream, in, his, infancy, he, and, his, parents, were, besieged, in, vienna, by, albert, of, austria, one, source, relates, that, during, the, siege, s, bleakest, days, the, young, prince, wandered, about, the, castle, garrison, begging, the, servants, and, men, at, arms, for, bits, of, bread, he, was, the, favourite, child, of, his, mother, whose, personality, was, a, contrast, to, his, father, although, there, seemed, to, be, communication, problems, between, mother, and, son, as, she, spoke, portuguese, reportedly, she, told, maximilian, that, if, i, had, known, my, son, that, you, would, become, like, your, father, i, would, have, regretted, having, born, you, for, the, throne, her, early, death, pushed, him, even, more, towards, a, man, s, world, where, one, grew, up, first, as, a, warrior, rather, than, a, politician, despite, the, efforts, of, his, father, frederick, and, his, tutor, peter, engelbrecht, whom, maximilian, held, in, contempt, all, his, life, because, of, his, violent, teaching, methods, which, according, to, cuspinianus, only, made, maximilian, hate, science, maximilian, became, an, indifferent, at, times, belligerent, student, who, much, preferred, physical, activities, than, learning, he, would, later, rediscover, the, love, of, science, and, culture, on, his, own, terms, though, especially, during, his, time, in, burgundy, under, the, influence, of, mary, of, burgundy, although, the, two, remained, on, good, terms, overall, and, the, emperor, encouraged, maximilian, s, interest, in, weapons, and, the, hunt, as, well, as, let, him, attend, important, meetings, frederick, was, horrified, by, his, only, surviving, son, and, heir, s, overzealousness, in, chivalric, contests, extravagance, and, especially, a, heavy, tendency, towards, wine, feasts, and, young, women, which, became, evident, during, their, trips, in, 1473, 74, even, though, he, was, still, very, young, the, prince, s, skills, and, physical, attractiveness, made, him, the, center, everywhere, he, went, although, frederick, had, forbidden, the, princes, of, the, empire, from, fighting, with, maximilian, in, tournaments, maximilian, gave, himself, the, necessary, permission, at, the, first, chance, he, got, frederick, did, not, allow, him, to, participate, in, the, 1474, war, against, burgundy, though, and, placed, him, under, the, care, of, the, bishop, of, augsburg, instead, the, duke, of, burgundy, charles, the, bold, was, the, chief, political, opponent, of, maximilian, s, father, frederick, iii, frederick, was, concerned, about, burgundy, s, expansionist, tendencies, on, the, western, border, of, his, holy, roman, empire, and, to, forestall, military, conflict, he, attempted, to, secure, the, marriage, of, charles, only, daughter, mary, of, burgundy, to, his, son, maximilian, after, the, siege, of, neuss, 1474, 75, he, was, successful, perhaps, as, preparation, for, his, task, in, the, netherlands, in, 1476, at, the, age, of, 17, in, the, name, of, his, father, apparently, maximilian, commanded, a, military, campaign, against, hungary, the, first, actual, battlefield, experience, in, his, life, command, responsibility, was, likely, shared, with, more, experienced, generals, though, the, wedding, between, maximilian, and, mary, took, place, on, 19, august, 1477, maximilian, s, wife, had, inherited, the, large, burgundian, domains, in, france, and, the, low, countries, upon, her, father, s, death, in, the, battle, of, nancy, on, 5, january, 1477, the, duchy, of, burgundy, was, also, claimed, by, the, french, crown, under, salic, law, with, louis, xi, of, france, vigorously, asserting, his, claim, through, military, force, maximilian, at, once, undertook, the, defence, of, his, wife, s, dominions, without, support, from, the, empire, and, with, an, empty, treasury, left, by, charles, the, bold, s, campaigns, mary, had, to, pawn, her, jewels, to, obtain, loans, he, carried, out, a, campaign, against, the, french, during, 1478, 1479, and, reconquered, le, quesnoy, conde, and, antoing, he, defeated, the, french, forces, at, the, battle, of, guinegate, in, modern, enguinegatte, on, 7, august, 1479, despite, winning, maximilian, had, to, abandon, the, siege, of, th, rouanne, and, disband, his, army, either, because, the, netherlanders, did, not, want, him, to, become, too, strong, or, because, his, treasury, was, empty, the, battle, was, an, important, landmark, in, military, history, though, the, burgundian, pikemen, were, the, precursors, of, the, landsknechte, while, the, french, side, derived, the, momentum, for, military, reform, from, their, loss, according, to, some, maximilian, and, mary, s, wedding, contract, stipulated, that, their, children, would, succeed, them, but, that, the, couple, could, not, be, each, other, s, heirs, mary, tried, to, bypass, this, rule, with, a, promise, to, transfer, territories, as, a, gift, in, case, of, her, death, but, her, plans, were, confounded, after, mary, s, death, in, a, riding, accident, on, 27, march, 1482, near, the, wijnendale, castle, maximilian, s, aim, was, now, to, secure, the, inheritance, to, his, and, mary, s, son, philip, the, handsome, according, to, haemers, and, sutch, the, original, marriage, contract, stipulated, that, maximilian, could, not, inherit, her, burgundian, lands, if, they, had, children, the, guinegate, victory, made, maximilian, popular, but, as, an, inexperienced, ruler, he, hurt, himself, politically, by, trying, to, centralize, authority, without, respecting, traditional, rights, and, consulting, relevant, political, bodies, the, belgian, historian, eug, ne, duchesne, comments, that, these, years, were, among, the, saddest, and, most, turbulent, in, the, history, of, the, country, and, despite, his, later, great, imperial, career, maximilian, unfortunately, could, never, compensate, for, the, mistakes, he, made, as, regent, in, this, period, some, of, the, netherlander, provinces, were, hostile, to, maximilian, and, in, 1482, they, signed, a, treaty, with, louis, xi, in, arras, that, forced, maximilian, to, give, up, franche, comt, and, artois, to, the, french, crown, they, openly, rebelled, twice, in, the, period, 1482, 1492, attempting, to, regain, the, autonomy, they, had, enjoyed, under, mary, flemish, rebels, managed, to, capture, philip, and, even, maximilian, himself, but, they, released, maximilian, when, frederick, iii, intervened, in, 1489, as, he, turned, his, attention, to, his, hereditary, lands, he, left, the, low, countries, in, the, hands, of, albert, of, saxony, who, proved, to, be, an, excellent, choice, as, he, was, less, emotionally, committed, to, the, low, countries, and, more, flexible, as, a, politician, than, maximilian, while, also, being, a, capable, general, by, 1492, rebellions, were, completely, suppressed, maximilian, revoked, the, great, privilege, and, established, a, strong, ducal, monarchy, undisturbed, by, particularism, but, he, would, not, reintroduce, charles, the, bold, s, centralizing, ordinances, since, 1489, after, his, departure, the, government, under, albert, of, saxony, had, made, more, efforts, in, consulting, representative, institutions, and, showed, more, restraint, in, subjugating, recalcitrant, territories, notables, who, had, previously, supported, rebellions, returned, to, city, administrations, the, estates, general, continued, to, develop, as, a, regular, meeting, place, of, the, central, government, the, harsh, suppression, of, the, rebellions, did, have, an, unifying, effect, in, that, provinces, stopped, behaving, like, separate, entities, each, supporting, a, different, lord, helmut, koenigsberger, opines, that, it, was, not, the, erratic, leadership, of, maximilian, who, was, brave, but, hardly, understood, the, netherlands, but, the, estates, desire, for, the, survival, of, the, country, that, made, the, burgundian, monarchy, survive, jean, berenger, and, c, a, simpson, argue, that, maximilian, as, a, gifted, military, champion, and, organizer, did, save, the, netherlands, from, france, although, the, conflict, between, the, estates, and, his, personal, ambitions, caused, a, catastrophic, situation, in, the, short, term, peter, spufford, opines, that, the, invasion, was, prevented, by, a, combination, of, the, estates, and, maximilian, although, the, cost, of, war, maximilian, s, spendthrift, liberality, and, the, interests, enforced, by, his, german, bankers, did, cause, huge, expenditure, while, income, was, falling, jelle, haemers, comments, that, the, estates, stopped, their, support, towards, the, young, and, ambitious, impresario, director, of, war, who, took, personal, control, of, both, the, military, and, financial, details, during, the, war, because, they, knew, that, after, guinegate, the, nature, of, the, war, was, not, defensive, anymore, maximilian, and, his, followers, had, managed, to, achieve, remarkable, success, in, stabilizing, the, situation, though, and, a, stalemate, was, kept, in, ghent, as, well, as, in, bruges, before, the, tragic, death, of, mary, in, 1482, completely, turned, the, political, landscape, in, the, whole, country, upside, down, according, to, haemers, while, willem, zoete, s, indictment, of, maximilian, s, government, was, a, one, sided, picture, that, exaggerated, the, negative, points, and, the, regency, council, displayed, many, of, the, same, problems, maximilian, and, his, followers, could, have, been, more, prudent, when, dealing, with, the, complaints, of, their, opponents, before, matters, became, bigger, during, his, time, in, the, low, countries, he, had, experimented, with, all, kinds, of, military, models, available, first, urban, militia, and, vassalic, troops, then, french, style, companies, that, were, too, rigid, and, costly, and, finally, germanic, mercenaries, when, albert, of, saxony, came, to, the, scene, these, became, their, main, force, the, brutal, efficiency, of, germanic, mercenaries, together, with, the, financial, support, of, cities, outside, flanders, like, antwerp, amsterdam, mechelen, and, brussels, as, well, as, a, small, group, of, loyal, landed, nobles, proved, decisive, in, the, burgundian, habsburg, regime, s, final, triumph, reviewing, the, french, historian, amable, sablon, du, corail, s, la, guerre, le, prince, et, ses, sujets, les, finances, des, pays, bas, bourguignons, sous, marie, de, bourgogne, et, maximilien, d, autriche, 1477, 1493, marc, boone, comments, that, the, brutality, described, shows, maximilian, and, the, habsburg, dynasty, s, insatiable, greed, of, expansion, and, inability, to, adapt, to, local, traditions, while, jean, fran, ois, lassalmonie, opines, that, the, nation, building, process, successful, with, the, establishment, of, a, common, tax, was, remarkably, similar, to, the, same, process, in, france, including, the, hesitation, in, working, with, local, levels, of, the, political, society, except, that, the, struggle, was, shorter, and, after, 1494, a, peaceful, dialogue, between, the, prince, and, the, estates, was, reached, jelle, haemers, suggests, that, the, level, of, violence, associated, with, the, suppression, of, the, revolts, as, traditionally, imagined, has, been, exaggerated, and, that, most, of, the, violence, happened, in, a, symbolical, manner, but, also, cautions, against, the, tendency, to, consider, the, central, state, in, the, sense, of, a, modern, state, while, it, has, been, suggested, that, maximilian, displayed, a, class, based, mentality, that, favoured, the, aristocrats, a, modern, historian, who, shares, this, viewpoint, is, koenigsberger, recent, studies, suggest, that, as, evidenced, by, the, court, ordinance, of, 1482, at, this, point, before, mary, s, death, threats, to, his, rule, seemed, to, have, been, eliminated, among, others, he, sought, to, promote, parvenus, who, were, beholden, to, himself, often, either, functionaries, who, had, risen, under, charles, the, bold, and, then, proved, loyalty, to, maximilian, or, representatives, of, the, mercantile, elites, and, at, an, alarming, speed, for, the, traditional, elites, after, the, rebellions, concerning, the, aristocracy, although, maximilian, punished, few, with, death, unlike, what, he, himself, later, described, in, theuerdank, their, properties, were, largely, confiscated, and, they, were, replaced, with, a, new, elite, class, loyal, to, the, habsburgs, among, whom, there, were, noblemen, who, had, been, part, of, traditional, high, nobility, but, elevated, to, supranational, importance, only, in, this, period, the, most, important, of, these, were, john, iii, and, frederik, of, egmont, engelbrecht, ii, of, nassau, henry, of, witthem, and, the, brothers, of, glymes, bergen, in, early, 1486, he, retook, mortaigne, l, ecluse, honnecourt, and, even, th, rouanne, but, the, same, thing, like, in, 1479, happened, he, lacked, financial, resources, to, exploit, and, keep, his, gains, only, in, 1492, with, a, stable, internal, situation, he, was, able, to, reconquer, and, keep, franche, comt, and, arras, on, the, pretext, that, the, french, had, repudiated, his, daughter, in, 1493, maximilian, and, charles, viii, of, france, signed, the, treaty, of, senlis, with, which, artois, and, franche, comt, returned, to, burgundian, rule, while, picardy, was, confirmed, as, french, possession, the, french, also, continued, to, keep, the, duchy, of, burgundy, thus, a, large, part, of, the, netherlands, known, as, the, seventeen, provinces, stayed, in, the, habsburg, patrimony, on, 8, january, 1488, using, a, similar, 1373, french, ordinance, as, the, model, together, with, philip, he, issued, the, ordinance, of, admiralty, that, organized, the, admiralty, as, a, state, institution, and, strove, to, centralize, maritime, authority, this, was, a, departure, from, the, policy, of, philip, the, good, whose, 1458, ordinance, tried, to, restore, maritime, order, by, decentralizing, power, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, dutch, navy, although, initially, the, policy, faced, opposition, and, unfavourable, political, climate, which, only, improved, with, the, appointment, of, philip, of, burgundy, beveren, in, 1491, a, permanent, navy, only, took, shape, after, 1555, under, the, governorship, of, his, granddaughter, mary, of, hungary, in, 1493, frederick, iii, died, thus, maximilian, i, became, de, facto, leader, of, the, holy, roman, empire, he, decided, to, transfer, power, to, the, 15, year, old, philip, during, the, time, in, the, low, countries, he, contracted, such, emotional, problems, that, except, for, rare, necessary, occasions, he, would, never, return, to, the, land, again, after, gaining, control, when, the, estates, sent, a, delegation, to, offer, him, the, regency, after, philip, s, death, in, 1506, he, evaded, them, for, months, as, suzerain, maximilian, continued, to, involve, himself, with, the, low, countries, from, afar, his, son, s, and, daughter, s, governments, tried, to, maintain, a, compromise, between, the, states, and, the, empire, philip, in, particular, sought, to, maintain, an, independent, burgundian, policy, which, sometimes, caused, disagreements, with, his, father, as, philip, preferred, to, maintain, peace, and, economic, development, for, his, land, maximilian, was, left, fighting, charles, of, egmond, over, guelders, on, his, own, resources, at, one, point, philip, let, french, troops, supporting, guelders, s, resistance, to, his, rule, pass, through, his, own, land, only, at, the, end, of, his, reign, philip, decided, to, deal, with, this, threat, together, with, his, father, by, this, time, guelders, had, been, affected, by, the, continuous, state, of, war, and, other, problems, the, duke, of, cleves, and, the, bishop, of, utrecht, hoping, to, share, spoils, gave, philip, aid, maximilian, invested, his, own, son, with, guelders, and, zutphen, within, months, and, with, his, father, s, skilled, use, of, field, artillery, philip, conquered, the, whole, land, and, charles, of, egmond, was, forced, to, prostrate, himself, in, front, of, philip, maximilian, would, like, to, see, the, guelders, matter, to, be, dealt, with, once, and, for, all, but, as, charles, later, escaped, and, philip, was, at, haste, to, make, his, 1506, fatal, journey, to, spain, troubles, would, soon, arise, again, leaving, margaret, to, deal, with, the, problems, maximilian, was, exasperated, by, the, attitude, of, philip, whom, in, maximilian, s, imagination, was, probably, influenced, by, insidious, french, agency, and, the, estates, whom, he, considered, to, be, unbelievably, nonchalant, and, tightfisted, about, a, threat, to, their, own, country, s, security, philip, s, death, in, burgos, was, a, heavy, blow, personally, maximilian, s, entourage, seemed, to, have, concealed, the, incident, from, him, for, more, than, ten, days, and, also, politically, as, by, this, time, he, had, become, his, father, s, most, important, international, ally, although, he, retained, his, independent, judgement, all, their, joint, ventures, fell, apart, including, the, planned, italian, expedition, in, 1508, the, estates, preferred, to, maintain, peace, with, france, and, guelders, but, charles, of, egmont, the, de, facto, lord, of, guelders, continued, to, cause, trouble, in, 1511, margaret, made, an, alliance, with, england, and, besieged, venlo, but, charles, of, egmont, invaded, holland, so, the, siege, had, to, be, lifted, james, d, tracy, opines, that, maximilian, and, margaret, were, reasonable, in, demanding, more, stern, measures, against, guelders, but, their, critics, in, the, estates, general, that, had, continuously, voted, against, providing, funds, for, wars, against, guelders, and, among, the, nobles, naively, thought, that, charles, of, egmont, could, be, controlled, by, maintaining, the, peaceful, relationship, with, the, king, of, france, his, patron, leading, humanists, in, the, netherlands, like, erasmus, and, hadrianus, barlandus, displayed, a, distrust, towards, the, government, and, especially, the, person, of, maximilian, whom, they, believed, to, be, a, warlike, and, greedy, prince, after, the, brutal, 1517, campaign, of, charles, of, egmont, in, friesland, and, holland, these, humanists, in, their, mistaken, belief, spread, the, stories, that, the, emperor, and, other, princes, were, concocting, clever, schemes, and, creating, wars, just, to, expand, the, habsburg, dominion, and, extracting, money, by, the, time, margaret, became, regent, maximilian, was, less, inclined, to, help, regarding, the, guelders, matter, he, suggested, to, her, that, the, estates, in, the, low, countries, should, defend, themselves, forcing, her, to, sign, the, 1513, treaty, with, charles, habsburg, netherlands, would, only, be, able, to, incorporate, guelders, and, zutphen, under, charles, v, following, margaret, s, strategy, of, defending, the, low, countries, with, foreign, armies, in, 1513, at, the, head, of, henry, viii, s, army, maximilian, gained, a, victory, against, the, french, at, the, battle, of, the, spurs, at, little, cost, to, himself, or, his, daughter, in, fact, according, to, margaret, the, low, countries, got, a, profit, of, one, million, of, gold, from, supplying, the, english, army, for, the, sake, of, his, grandson, charles, s, burgundian, lands, he, ordered, th, rouanne, s, walls, to, be, demolished, the, stronghold, had, often, served, as, a, backdoor, for, french, interference, in, the, low, countries, maximilian, was, elected, king, of, the, romans, on, 16, february, 1486, in, frankfurt, am, main, at, his, father, s, initiative, and, crowned, on, 9, april, 1486, in, aachen, much, of, the, austrian, territories, and, vienna, were, under, the, rule, of, king, matthias, corvinus, of, hungary, as, a, result, of, the, austrian, hungarian, war, 1477, 1488, maximilian, was, now, a, king, without, lands, matthias, corvinus, offered, emperor, frederick, and, his, son, prince, maximilian, the, return, of, austrian, provinces, and, vienna, if, they, would, renounce, the, treaty, of, 1463, and, accept, matthias, as, frederick, s, designated, heir, and, favoured, successor, as, holy, roman, emperor, before, this, was, settled, though, matthias, died, in, vienna, in, 1490, however, after, matthias, corvinus, died, from, a, stroke, on, 6, april, 1490, civil, war, broke, out, in, hungary, between, the, supporters, of, john, corvinus, and, the, supporters, of, king, vladislaus, of, bohemia, due, to, the, hungarian, civil, war, new, possibilities, were, opened, for, maximilan, from, july, 1490, maximilian, began, a, series, of, short, sieges, that, reconquered, cities, and, fortresses, that, his, father, had, lost, in, austria, maximilian, entered, vienna, without, siege, already, evacuated, by, the, hungarians, in, august, 1490, he, was, injured, while, attacking, the, citadel, guarded, by, a, garrison, of, 400, hungarians, troops, who, twice, repelled, his, forces, but, after, some, days, they, surrendered, in, addition, the, county, of, tyrol, and, duchy, of, bavaria, went, to, war, in, the, late, 15th, century, bavaria, demanded, money, from, tyrol, that, had, been, loaned, on, the, collateral, of, tyrolean, lands, in, 1490, the, two, states, demanded, that, maximilian, i, step, in, to, mediate, the, dispute, his, habsburg, cousin, the, childless, archduke, sigismund, was, negotiating, to, sell, tyrol, to, their, wittelsbach, rivals, rather, than, let, emperor, frederick, inherit, it, maximilian, s, charm, and, tact, though, led, to, a, reconciliation, and, a, reunited, dynastic, rule, in, the, 1490, because, tyrol, had, no, law, code, at, this, time, the, nobility, freely, expropriated, money, from, the, populace, which, caused, the, court, in, innsbruck, to, fester, with, corruption, after, taking, control, maximilian, instituted, immediate, financial, reform, gaining, control, of, tyrol, for, the, habsburgs, was, of, strategic, importance, because, it, linked, the, swiss, confederacy, to, the, habsburg, controlled, austrian, lands, which, facilitated, some, imperial, geographic, continuity, from, 1497, 98, maximilian, negotiated, an, inheritance, contract, with, the, last, meinhardin, prince, count, leonhard, of, gorizia, which, was, intended, to, bring, the, county, of, gorizia, to, the, habsburgs, however, it, was, only, after, a, dispute, with, the, republic, of, venice, that, was, finally, won, that, the, gorizia, stadtholder, virgil, von, graben, who, had, been, won, over, with, high, honours, finally, succeeded, in, realizing, this, contract, beatrice, of, naples, matthias, corvinus, s, widow, initially, supported, maximilian, out, of, hope, that, he, would, marry, her, but, maximilian, did, not, want, this, liaison, the, hungarian, magnates, found, maximilian, impressive, but, they, wanted, a, king, they, could, dominate, the, crown, of, hungary, thus, fell, to, king, vladislaus, ii, who, was, deemed, weaker, in, personality, and, also, agreed, to, marry, beatrice, tam, s, bak, cz, the, hungarian, chancellor, allied, himself, with, maximilian, and, helped, him, to, circumvent, the, 1505, diet, which, declared, that, no, foreigner, could, be, elected, as, king, of, hungary, with, money, from, innsbruck, and, southern, german, towns, he, raised, enough, cavalry, and, landsknechte, to, campaign, into, hungary, itself, despite, hungary, s, lower, nobility, the, gentry, s, hostility, to, the, habsburg, he, managed, to, gain, many, supporters, from, higher, aristocracy, including, several, of, corvinus, s, former, supporters, one, of, them, jakob, sz, kely, handed, over, the, styrian, castles, to, him, he, claimed, his, status, as, king, of, hungary, in, the, meantime, vladislas, was, proclaimed, king, of, hungary, on, july, 15, 1490, and, was, crowned, at, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, in, september, maximilian, responded, with, great, energy, using, a, generous, grant, of, funds, from, the, tyrolean, estates, to, invade, hungary, with, an, army, of, around, 17, 000, men, crossing, the, raab, river, in, late, october, maximilian, encountered, little, resistance, in, hungary, as, the, unprepared, vladislas, was, disinclined, towards, decisive, action, maximilian, was, joined, by, numerous, hungarian, nobles, and, even, magnates, despite, stiff, resistance, the, city, was, bombarded, with, maximilian, personally, directing, the, artillery, and, eventually, captured, this, resulted, in, a, disgraceful, scene, of, looting, and, slaughter, that, maximilian, and, his, officers, were, unable, to, prevent, the, next, day, became, a, turning, point, in, maximilian, s, campaign, his, mercenaries, openly, mutinied, due, to, the, prohibition, of, looting, faced, with, a, severe, winter, the, troops, refused, to, continue, the, war, requesting, maximilian, to, double, their, pay, which, he, could, not, afford, the, revolt, turned, the, situation, in, favour, of, the, jagiellonian, forces, maximilian, was, forced, to, return, he, depended, on, his, father, and, the, territorial, estates, for, financial, support, soon, he, reconquered, lower, and, inner, austria, for, his, father, who, returned, and, settled, at, linz, worrying, about, his, son, s, adventurous, tendencies, frederick, decided, to, starve, him, financially, in, 1491, they, signed, the, peace, treaty, of, pressburg, which, provided, that, maximilian, recognized, vladislaus, as, king, of, hungary, but, the, habsburgs, would, inherit, the, throne, on, the, extinction, of, vladislaus, s, male, line, and, the, austrian, side, also, received, 100, 000, golden, florins, as, war, reparations, it, was, with, maximilian, that, the, croatians, began, to, harbour, a, connection, to, the, house, of, habsburg, except, the, two, most, powerful, noblemen, duke, ivanis, corvinus, and, bernardin, frankopan, the, croatian, nobility, wanted, him, as, king, worrying, that, a, protracted, multi, fronted, war, would, leave, him, overextended, though, maximilian, evacuated, from, croatia, he, had, conquered, the, whole, northern, part, of, the, country, previously, and, accepted, the, treaty, with, the, jagiellons, as, the, treaty, of, senlis, had, resolved, french, differences, with, the, holy, roman, empire, king, louis, xii, of, france, had, secured, borders, in, the, north, and, turned, his, attention, to, italy, where, he, made, claims, for, the, duchy, of, milan, in, 1499, 1500, he, conquered, it, and, drove, the, sforza, regent, lodovico, il, moro, into, exile, this, brought, him, into, a, potential, conflict, with, maximilian, who, on, 16, march, 1494, had, married, bianca, maria, sforza, a, daughter, of, galeazzo, maria, sforza, duke, of, milan, however, maximilian, was, unable, to, hinder, the, french, from, taking, over, milan, the, prolonged, italian, wars, resulted, in, maximilian, joining, the, holy, league, to, counter, the, french, his, campaigns, in, italy, generally, were, not, successful, and, his, progress, there, was, quickly, checked, maximilian, s, italian, campaigns, tend, to, be, criticized, for, being, wasteful, and, gaining, him, little, despite, the, emperor, s, work, in, enhancing, his, army, technically, and, organization, wise, due, to, financial, difficulties, the, forces, he, could, muster, were, always, too, small, to, make, a, decisive, difference, in, italy, he, gained, the, derisive, nickname, of, massimiliano, di, pochi, denari, maximilian, the, moneyless, one, particularly, humiliating, episode, happened, in, 1508, with, a, force, mustered, largely, from, hereditary, lands, and, with, limited, resources, the, emperor, decided, to, attack, venice, the, diversionary, force, under, sixt, trautson, were, routed, by, bartolomeo, d, alviano, sixt, trautson, himself, was, among, the, fallen, while, maximilian, s, own, advance, was, blocked, by, the, main, venetian, force, under, niccol, di, pitigliano, and, a, french, army, under, alessandro, trivulzio, bartolomeo, d, alviano, then, pushed, into, the, imperial, territory, seizing, gorizia, and, trieste, forcing, maximilian, to, sign, a, very, unfavourable, truce, afterwards, he, formed, the, league, of, cambrai, together, with, spain, france, and, pope, julius, ii, and, won, back, the, territories, he, had, conceded, and, some, venetian, possessions, most, of, the, slovene, inhabited, areas, were, transferred, to, the, habsburgs, but, atrocities, and, expenses, for, war, devastated, austria, and, carniola, lack, of, financial, means, meant, that, he, depended, on, allies, resources, and, just, like, in, the, low, countries, he, sometimes, practically, functioned, as, the, condottiero, when, schiner, suggested, that, they, should, let, war, feed, war, though, he, did, not, agree, or, was, not, brutal, enough, to, do, that, he, acknowledged, french, control, of, milan, in, 1515, the, situation, in, italy, was, not, the, only, problem, maximilian, had, at, the, time, the, swiss, won, a, decisive, victory, against, the, empire, in, the, battle, of, dornach, on, 22, july, 1499, maximilian, had, no, choice, but, to, agree, to, a, peace, treaty, signed, on, 22, september, 1499, in, basel, that, granted, the, swiss, confederacy, independence, from, the, holy, roman, empire, jewish, policy, under, maximilian, fluctuated, greatly, usually, influenced, by, financial, considerations, and, the, emperor, s, vacillating, attitude, when, facing, opposing, views, in, 1496, maximilian, issued, a, decree, which, expelled, all, jews, from, styria, and, wiener, neustadt, between, 1494, and, 1510, he, authorized, no, less, than, thirteen, expulsions, of, jews, in, return, of, sizeable, fiscal, compensations, from, local, government, the, expelled, jews, were, allowed, to, resettle, in, lower, austria, buttaroni, comments, that, this, inconsistency, showed, that, even, maximilian, himself, did, not, believe, his, expulsion, decision, was, just, after, 1510, though, this, happened, only, once, and, he, showed, an, unusually, resolute, attitude, in, resisting, a, campaign, to, expel, jews, from, regensburg, david, price, comments, that, during, the, first, seventeen, years, of, his, reign, he, was, a, great, threat, to, the, jews, but, after, 1510, even, if, his, attitude, was, still, exploitative, his, policy, gradually, changed, a, factor, that, probably, played, a, role, in, the, change, was, maximilian, s, success, in, expanding, imperial, taxing, over, german, jewry, at, this, point, he, probably, considered, the, possibility, of, generating, tax, money, from, stable, jewish, communities, instead, of, temporary, financial, compensations, from, local, jurisdictions, who, sought, to, expel, jews, noflatscher, and, p, terfi, note, that, maximilian, had, a, deep, dislike, for, jews, since, childhood, the, reason, of, which, is, unknown, since, both, of, his, parents, greatly, favoured, the, jews, in, 1509, relying, on, the, influence, of, kunigunde, maximilian, s, pious, sister, and, the, cologne, dominicans, the, anti, jewish, agitator, johannes, pfefferkorn, was, authorized, by, maximilian, to, confiscate, all, offending, jewish, books, including, prayer, books, except, the, bible, the, confiscations, happened, in, frankfurt, bingen, mainz, and, other, german, cities, responding, to, the, order, the, archbishop, of, mainz, the, city, council, of, frankfurt, and, various, german, princes, tried, to, intervene, in, defense, of, the, jews, maximilian, consequently, ordered, the, confiscated, books, to, be, returned, on, 23, may, 1510, though, influenced, by, a, supposed, host, desecration, and, blood, libel, in, brandenburg, as, well, as, pressure, from, kunigunde, he, ordered, the, creation, of, an, investigating, commission, and, asked, for, expert, opinions, from, german, universities, and, scholars, the, prominent, humanist, johann, reuchlin, argued, strongly, in, defense, of, the, jewish, books, especially, the, talmud, reuchlin, s, arguments, seemed, to, leave, an, impression, on, the, emperor, who, followed, his, advice, against, the, recommendation, of, his, own, commission, who, gradually, developed, an, intellectual, interest, in, the, talmud, and, other, jewish, books, maximilian, later, urged, the, hebraist, petrus, galatinus, to, defend, reuchlin, s, position, galatinus, dedicated, his, work, de, arcanis, catholicae, veritatis, which, provided, a, literary, threshold, where, jews, and, gentiles, might, meet, to, the, emperor, it, was, maximilian, s, support, that, enabled, reuchlin, to, fully, devote, himself, to, jewish, literature, like, his, father, frederick, iii, and, his, grandson, ferdinand, i, he, held, jewish, physicians, and, teachers, in, high, esteem, in, 1514, he, appointed, paulus, ricius, a, jew, who, converted, to, christianity, as, his, personal, physician, he, was, more, interested, in, ricius, s, hebrew, skills, than, in, his, medical, abilities, though, in, 1515, he, reminded, his, treasurer, jakob, villinger, that, ricius, was, admitted, for, the, purpose, of, translating, the, talmud, into, latin, and, urged, villinger, to, keep, an, eye, on, him, perhaps, overwhelmed, by, the, emperor, s, request, ricius, only, managed, to, translate, two, out, of, sixty, three, mishna, tractates, before, the, emperor, s, death, ricius, managed, to, publish, a, translation, of, joseph, gikatilla, s, kabbalistic, work, the, gates, of, light, which, was, dedicated, to, maximilian, though, it, was, under, frederick, and, maximilian, that, the, foundation, of, modern, judaism, arose, steeped, in, humanism, it, was, under, maximilian, that, policies, concerning, the, romani, became, harsher, in, 1500, a, notice, was, given, to, the, romani, that, they, had, to, leave, germany, by, the, next, easter, or, become, outlaws, the, romani, had, to, evade, the, law, by, following, a, constant, circuit, from, an, area, to, another, and, at, times, obtain, patronage, from, aristocrats, the, reformation, beginning, in, 1517, did, not, consider, them, foreigners, anymore, but, as, local, beggars, they, also, faced, discrimination, the, change, in, policy, was, seemingly, linked, to, the, fear, of, the, turks, the, romani, were, accused, of, being, spies, for, the, turks, kenrich, and, puxon, explains, that, connect, the, situation, with, the, consolidation, of, european, nation, states, that, also, stimulated, similar, policies, elsewhere, within, the, holy, roman, empire, there, was, also, a, consensus, that, deep, reforms, were, needed, to, preserve, the, unity, of, the, empire, for, most, of, his, reign, frederick, iii, had, considered, reform, as, a, threat, to, his, imperial, prerogatives, and, wanted, to, avoid, direct, confrontations, with, the, princes, on, the, matter, however, in, his, last, years, mainly, to, secure, election, for, maximilian, he, presided, over, the, initial, phase, of, reform, maximilian, though, was, more, open, to, reform, from, 1488, through, his, reign, as, sole, ruler, he, practiced, a, policy, of, brokerage, acting, as, the, impartial, judge, between, options, suggested, by, the, princes, many, measures, were, launched, in, the, 1495, reichstag, at, worms, a, new, organ, was, introduced, the, reichskammergericht, that, was, to, be, largely, independent, from, the, emperor, a, new, tax, was, launched, to, finance, the, empire, s, affairs, above, all, military, campaigns, the, gemeine, pfennig, it, was, levied, for, the, first, time, between, 1495, and, 1499, raising, 136, 000, florins, and, another, five, times, during, the, 1512, 1551, period, before, being, supplanted, by, the, matricular, system, which, allowed, common, burdens, to, be, assessed, at, imperial, as, well, as, kreis, level, to, create, a, rival, for, the, reichskammergericht, maximilian, established, the, reichshofrat, which, had, its, seat, in, vienna, unlike, the, reichskammergericht, the, reichshofrat, looked, into, criminal, matters, and, even, allowed, the, emperors, the, means, to, depose, rulers, who, did, not, live, up, to, expectations, pavlac, and, lott, note, that, during, maximilian, s, reign, this, council, was, not, popular, though, according, to, barbara, stollberg, rilinger, though, throughout, the, early, modern, period, the, reichshofrat, remained, by, far, the, faster, and, more, efficient, among, the, two, courts, the, reichskammergericht, on, the, other, hand, was, often, torn, by, matters, related, to, confessional, alliance, around, 1497, 1498, as, part, of, his, administrative, reforms, he, restructured, his, privy, council, geheimer, rat, a, decision, which, today, induces, much, scholarly, discussion, apart, from, balancing, the, reichskammergericht, with, the, reichshofrat, this, act, of, restructuring, seemed, to, suggest, that, as, westphal, quoting, ortlieb, the, imperial, ruler, independent, of, the, existence, of, a, supreme, court, remained, the, contact, person, for, hard, pressed, subjects, in, legal, disputes, as, well, so, that, a, special, agency, to, deal, with, these, matters, could, appear, sensible, as, also, shown, by, the, large, number, of, supplications, he, received, in, 1500, as, maximilian, urgently, needed, assistance, for, his, military, plans, he, agreed, to, establish, an, organ, called, the, reichsregiment, central, imperial, government, consisting, of, twenty, members, including, the, electors, with, the, emperor, or, his, representative, as, its, chairman, first, organized, in, 1501, in, nuremberg, and, consisted, of, the, deputies, of, the, emperor, local, rulers, commoners, and, the, prince, electors, of, the, holy, roman, empire, maximilian, resented, the, new, organization, as, it, weakened, his, powers, and, the, estates, failed, to, support, it, the, new, organ, proved, politically, weak, and, its, power, returned, to, maximilian, in, 1502, according, to, thomas, brady, jr, and, jan, dirk, m, ller, the, most, important, governmental, changes, targeted, the, heart, of, the, regime, the, chancery, early, in, maximilian, s, reign, the, court, chancery, at, innsbruck, competed, with, the, imperial, chancery, which, was, under, the, elector, archbishop, of, mainz, the, senior, imperial, chancellor, by, referring, the, political, matters, in, tyrol, austria, as, well, as, imperial, problems, to, the, court, chancery, maximilian, gradually, centralized, its, authority, the, two, chanceries, became, combined, in, 1502, jan, dirk, m, ller, opines, that, this, chancery, became, the, decisive, government, institution, since, 1502, in, 1496, the, emperor, created, a, general, treasury, hofkammer, in, innsbruck, which, became, responsible, for, all, the, hereditary, lands, the, chamber, of, accounts, raitkammer, at, vienna, was, made, subordinate, to, this, body, under, paul, von, liechtenstein, the, hofkammer, was, entrusted, with, not, only, hereditary, lands, affairs, but, maximilian, s, affairs, as, the, german, king, too, historian, joachim, whaley, points, out, that, there, are, usually, two, opposite, views, on, maximilian, s, rulership, one, side, is, represented, by, the, works, of, nineteenth, century, historians, like, heinrich, ullmann, or, leopold, von, ranke, which, criticize, him, for, selfishly, exploiting, the, german, nation, and, putting, the, interest, of, his, dynasty, over, his, germanic, nation, thus, impeding, the, unification, process, the, more, recent, side, is, represented, by, hermann, wiesflecker, s, biography, of, 1971, 86, which, praises, him, for, being, a, talented, and, successful, ruler, notable, not, only, for, his, realpolitik, but, also, for, his, cultural, activities, generally, and, for, his, literary, and, artistic, patronage, in, particular, according, to, brady, jr, ranke, is, right, regarding, the, fact, berthold, von, henneberg, and, other, princes, did, play, the, leading, role, in, presenting, the, proposals, for, creating, institutions, that, would, also, place, the, power, in, the, hands, of, the, princes, in, 1495, however, what, maximilian, opposed, was, not, reform, per, se, he, generally, shared, their, sentiments, regarding, ending, feuds, sounder, administrative, procedures, better, record, keeping, qualifications, for, offices, etc, responding, to, the, proposal, that, an, imperial, council, the, later, reichsregiment, should, be, created, he, agreed, and, welcomed, the, participation, of, the, estates, but, he, alone, should, be, the, one, who, appointed, members, and, the, council, should, function, only, during, his, campaigns, he, supported, modernizing, reforms, which, he, himself, pioneered, in, his, austrian, lands, but, also, wanted, to, tie, it, to, his, personal, control, above, all, by, permanent, taxation, which, the, estates, consistently, opposed, in, 1504, when, he, was, strong, enough, to, propose, his, own, ideas, of, such, a, council, the, cowered, estates, tried, to, resist, at, his, strongest, point, though, he, still, failed, to, find, a, solution, for, the, common, tax, matter, which, led, to, disasters, in, italy, later, stollberg, rilinger, notes, that, had, the, common, penny, been, successful, modern, governmental, structures, would, likely, emerge, on, the, empire, s, level, but, that, was, why, it, failed, as, it, was, not, in, the, interest, of, territorial, lords, meanwhile, he, explored, austria, s, potential, as, a, base, for, imperial, power, and, built, his, government, largely, with, officials, drawn, from, the, lower, aristocracy, and, burghers, in, southern, germany, whaley, notes, that, the, real, foundation, of, his, imperial, power, lay, with, his, networks, of, allies, and, clients, especially, the, less, powerful, estates, who, helped, him, to, recover, his, strength, in, 1502, his, first, reform, proposals, as, king, of, the, romans, in, 1486, were, about, the, creation, of, a, network, of, regional, unions, according, to, whaley, more, systematically, than, any, predecessor, maximilian, exploited, the, potential, of, regional, leagues, and, unions, to, extend, imperial, influence, and, to, create, the, possibility, of, imperial, government, in, the, reich, to, the, empire, the, mechanisms, involving, such, regional, institutions, bolstered, the, land, piece, ewiger, landfriede, declared, in, 1495, as, well, as, the, creation, of, the, reichskreise, imperial, circles, which, would, serve, the, purpose, of, organize, imperial, armies, collect, taxes, and, enforce, orders, of, the, imperial, institutions, there, were, six, at, first, in, 1512, the, number, increased, to, ten, between, 1500, and, 1512, although, they, were, only, fully, functional, some, decades, later, while, brady, describes, maximilian, s, thinking, as, dynastic, and, early, modern, heinz, angermeier, also, focusing, on, his, intentions, at, the, 1495, diet, writes, that, for, maximilian, the, first, politician, on, the, german, throne, dynastic, interests, and, imperial, politics, had, no, contradiction, rather, the, alliance, with, spain, imperial, prerogatives, anti, ottoman, agenda, european, leadership, and, inner, politics, were, all, tied, together, in, austria, maximilian, defined, two, administrative, units, lower, austria, and, upper, austria, further, austria, was, included, in, upper, austria, another, development, arising, from, the, reform, was, that, amidst, the, prolonged, struggles, between, the, monarchical, centralism, of, the, emperor, and, the, estates, based, federalism, of, the, princes, the, reichstag, imperial, diet, became, the, all, important, political, forum, and, the, supreme, legal, and, constitutional, institution, without, any, declared, legal, basis, or, inaugural, act, which, would, act, as, a, guarantee, for, the, preservation, of, the, empire, in, the, long, run, ultimately, the, results, of, the, reform, movement, presided, over, by, maximilian, as, presented, in, the, shape, of, newly, formed, structures, as, well, as, the, general, framework, functioning, as, a, constitutional, framework, were, a, compromise, between, emperor, and, estates, who, more, or, less, shared, common, cause, but, separate, interests, although, the, system, of, institutions, arose, from, this, were, not, complete, a, flexible, adaptive, problem, solving, mechanism, for, the, empire, was, formed, stollberg, also, links, the, development, of, the, reform, to, the, concentration, of, supranational, power, in, the, habsburgs, hand, which, manifested, in, the, successful, dynastic, marriages, of, maximilian, and, his, descendants, and, the, successful, defense, of, those, lands, notably, the, rich, low, countries, as, well, as, maximilian, s, development, of, a, revolutionary, post, system, that, helped, the, habsburgs, to, maintain, control, of, their, territories, additionally, the, communication, revolution, created, by, the, combination, of, the, postal, system, with, printing, would, boost, the, empire, s, capability, of, disseminating, orders, and, policies, as, well, as, its, coherence, in, general, elevating, cultural, life, and, also, help, reformers, like, luther, to, broadcast, their, views, effectively, recent, german, research, explores, the, importance, of, the, reichstags, that, followed, the, 1495, one, in, worms, the, 1512, reichstag, in, trier, that, maximilian, assembled, for, example, was, decisive, for, the, development, of, the, reichskammergericht, the, land, peace, and, the, gemeine, pfennig, although, by, this, point, it, was, clear, that, maximilian, was, already, past, his, best, years, the, early, signs, of, crisis, seemed, to, have, showed, already, in, cologne, 1505, which, according, to, dietmar, heil, resulted, in, the, fact, that, the, gemeine, pfennig, was, only, partially, approved, and, then, partially, implemented, seyboth, notes, that, in, his, later, years, he, became, more, irritable, obstinate, and, closed, which, led, to, growing, alienation, with, the, estates, he, recognized, the, trend, of, the, reichstag, to, become, a, more, modern, institution, the, concern, of, the, estates, with, internal, problems, and, contributed, to, the, solutions, but, only, so, that, his, own, interests, will, not, be, ignored, according, to, whaley, if, maximilian, ever, saw, germany, as, a, source, of, income, and, soldiers, only, he, failed, miserably, in, extracting, both, his, hereditary, lands, and, other, sources, always, contributed, much, more, the, estates, gave, him, the, equivalent, of, 50, 000, gulden, per, year, a, lower, than, even, the, taxes, paid, by, jews, in, both, the, reich, and, hereditary, lands, while, austria, contributed, 500, 000, to, 1, million, gulden, per, year, on, the, other, hand, the, attempts, he, demonstrated, in, building, the, imperial, system, alone, shows, that, he, did, consider, the, german, lands, a, real, sphere, of, government, in, which, aspirations, to, royal, rule, were, actively, and, purposefully, pursued, whaley, notes, that, despite, struggles, what, emerged, at, the, end, of, maximilian, s, rule, was, a, strengthened, monarchy, and, not, an, oligarchy, of, princes, if, he, was, usually, weak, when, trying, to, act, as, a, monarch, and, using, imperial, instituations, like, the, reichstag, maximilian, s, position, was, often, strong, when, acting, as, a, neutral, overlord, and, relying, on, regional, leagues, of, weaker, principalities, such, as, the, swabian, league, as, shown, in, his, ability, to, call, on, money, and, soldiers, to, mediate, the, bavaria, dispute, in, 1504, after, which, he, gained, significant, territories, in, alsace, swabia, and, tyrol, his, fiscal, reform, in, his, hereditary, lands, provided, a, model, for, other, german, princes, benjamin, curtis, suggests, that, while, maximilian, was, not, able, to, fully, create, a, common, government, for, his, lands, although, the, chancellery, and, court, council, were, able, to, coordinate, affairs, across, the, realms, he, strengthened, key, administrative, functions, in, austria, and, created, central, offices, to, deal, with, financial, political, and, judicial, matters, these, offices, replaced, the, feudal, system, and, became, representative, of, a, more, modern, system, that, was, administered, by, professionalized, officials, after, two, decades, of, reforms, the, emperor, retained, his, position, as, first, among, equals, while, the, empire, gained, common, institutions, through, which, the, emperor, shared, power, with, the, estates, dietmar, heil, argues, that, the, estates, actually, offered, maximilian, considerable, financial, help, in, consideration, of, their, financial, capacity, according, to, heil, historians, have, traditionally, been, too, receptive, to, the, statements, of, the, deceptive, emperor, who, tried, to, create, such, an, impression, in, order, to, generate, motivation, in, 1508, maximilian, with, the, assent, of, pope, julius, ii, took, the, title, erw, hlter, r, mischer, kaiser, elected, roman, emperor, thus, ending, the, centuries, old, custom, that, the, holy, roman, emperor, had, to, be, crowned, by, the, pope, at, the, 1495, diet, of, worms, the, reception, of, roman, law, was, accelerated, and, formalized, the, roman, law, was, made, binding, in, german, courts, except, in, the, case, it, was, contrary, to, local, statutes, in, practice, it, became, the, basic, law, throughout, germany, displacing, germanic, local, law, to, a, large, extent, although, germanic, law, was, still, operative, at, the, lower, courts, other, than, the, desire, to, achieve, legal, unity, and, other, factors, the, adoption, also, highlighted, the, continuity, between, the, ancient, roman, empire, and, the, holy, roman, empire, to, realize, his, resolve, to, reform, and, unify, the, legal, system, the, emperor, frequently, intervened, personally, in, matters, of, local, legal, matters, overriding, local, charters, and, customs, this, practice, was, often, met, with, irony, and, scorn, from, local, councils, who, wanted, to, protect, local, codes, maximilian, had, a, general, reputation, of, justice, and, clemency, but, could, occasionally, act, in, a, violent, and, resentful, manner, if, personally, affronted, in, 1499, as, the, ruler, of, tyrol, he, introduced, the, maximilianische, halsgerichtsordnung, the, penal, code, of, maximilian, this, was, the, first, codified, penal, law, in, the, german, speaking, world, the, law, attempted, to, introduce, regularity, into, contemporary, discrete, practices, of, the, courts, this, would, be, part, of, the, basis, for, the, constitutio, criminalis, carolina, established, under, charles, v, in, 1530, regarding, the, use, of, torture, the, court, needed, to, decide, whether, someone, should, be, tortured, if, such, a, decision, was, made, three, council, members, and, a, clerk, should, be, present, and, observe, whether, a, confession, was, made, only, because, of, the, fear, of, torture, or, the, pain, of, torture, or, that, another, person, would, be, harmed, during, the, austrian, hungarian, war, 1477, 1488, maximilian, s, father, frederick, iii, issued, the, first, modern, regulations, to, strengthen, military, discipline, in, 1508, using, this, ordinance, as, the, basis, maximilian, devised, the, first, military, code, articles, this, code, included, 23, articles, the, first, five, articles, prescribed, total, obedience, to, imperial, authority, article, 7, established, the, rules, of, conduct, in, camps, article, 13, exempted, churches, from, billeting, while, article, 14, forbade, violence, against, civilians, you, shall, swear, that, you, will, not, harm, any, pregnant, women, widows, and, orphans, priests, honest, maidens, and, mothers, under, the, fear, of, punishment, for, perjury, and, death, these, actions, that, indicated, the, early, developments, of, a, military, revolution, in, european, laws, had, a, tradition, in, the, roman, concept, of, a, just, war, and, ideas, of, sixteenth, century, scholars, who, developed, this, ancient, doctrine, with, a, main, thesis, which, advocated, that, war, was, a, matter, between, two, armies, and, thus, the, civilians, especially, women, children, and, old, people, should, be, given, immunity, the, code, would, be, the, basis, for, further, ordinances, by, charles, v, and, new, articles, by, maximilian, ii, which, became, the, universal, military, code, for, the, whole, holy, roman, empire, until, 1642, the, legal, reform, seriously, weakened, the, ancient, vehmic, court, vehmgericht, or, secret, tribunal, of, westphalia, traditionally, held, to, be, instituted, by, charlemagne, but, this, theory, is, now, considered, unlikely, although, it, would, not, be, abolished, completely, until, 1811, when, it, was, abolished, under, the, order, of, j, r, me, bonaparte, in, 1518, after, a, general, diet, of, all, habsburg, hereditary, lands, the, emperor, issued, the, innsbrucker, libell, which, set, out, the, general, defence, order, verteidigungsordnung, of, austrian, provinces, which, gathered, together, all, the, elements, that, had, appeared, and, developed, over, the, preceding, centuries, the, provincial, army, based, on, noble, cavalry, was, for, defence, only, bonded, labourers, were, conscripted, using, a, proportional, conscription, system, upper, and, lower, austrian, provinces, agreed, on, a, mutual, defence, pact, in, which, they, would, form, a, joint, command, structure, if, either, were, attacked, the, military, system, and, other, reforms, were, threatened, after, maximilian, s, de, th, but, would, be, restored, and, reorganized, later, under, ferdinand, i, according, to, brady, jr, maximilian, was, no, reformer, of, the, church, though, personally, pious, he, was, also, a, practical, caesaropapist, who, was, only, interested, in, the, ecclesiastical, organization, as, far, as, reforms, could, bring, him, political, and, fiscal, advantages, he, met, luther, once, at, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, 1518, a, rehearsal, for, worms, in, 1521, he, saw, the, grievances, and, agreed, with, luther, on, some, points, however, as, the, religious, question, was, a, matter, of, money, and, power, to, him, he, had, no, interest, in, stopping, the, indulgences, at, this, point, he, was, too, busy, with, his, grandson, s, election, as, luther, was, about, to, be, arrested, by, the, papal, legate, he, granted, him, a, letter, of, safe, passage, brady, notes, that, blindness, to, the, need, to, reform, from, above, would, lead, to, the, reform, from, below, maximilian, was, always, troubled, by, financial, shortcomings, his, income, never, seemed, to, be, enough, to, sustain, his, large, scale, goals, and, policies, for, this, reason, he, was, forced, to, take, substantial, credits, from, upper, german, banker, families, especially, from, the, gossembrot, baumgarten, fugger, and, welser, families, j, rg, baumgarten, even, served, as, maximilian, s, financial, advisor, the, connection, between, the, emperor, and, banking, families, in, augsburg, was, so, widely, known, that, francis, i, of, france, derisively, nicknamed, him, the, mayor, of, augsburg, another, story, recounts, that, a, french, courtier, called, him, the, alderman, of, augsburg, to, which, louis, xii, replied, yes, but, every, time, that, this, alderman, rings, the, tocsin, from, his, belfry, he, makes, all, france, tremble, referring, to, maximilian, s, military, ability, around, 70, percent, of, his, income, went, to, wars, and, by, the, 1510s, he, was, waging, wars, on, almost, all, sides, of, his, border, at, the, end, of, maximilian, s, rule, the, habsburgs, mountain, of, debt, totalled, six, million, gulden, to, six, and, a, half, million, gulden, depending, on, the, sources, by, 1531, the, remaining, amount, of, debt, was, estimated, at, 400, 000, gulden, about, 282, 669, spanish, ducats, in, his, entire, reign, he, had, spent, around, 25, million, gulden, much, of, which, was, contributed, by, his, most, loyal, subjects, the, tyrolers, the, historian, thomas, brady, comments, the, best, that, can, be, said, of, his, financial, practices, is, that, he, borrowed, democratically, from, rich, and, poor, alike, and, defaulted, with, the, same, even, handedness, by, comparison, when, he, abdicated, in, 1556, charles, v, left, philip, a, total, debt, of, 36, million, ducats, equal, to, the, income, from, spanish, america, for, his, entire, reign, while, ferdinand, i, left, a, debt, of, 12, 5, million, gulden, when, he, died, in, 1564, economy, and, economic, policies, under, the, reign, of, maximilian, is, a, relatively, unexplored, topic, according, to, benecke, overall, according, to, whaley, the, reign, of, maximilian, i, saw, recovery, and, growth, but, also, growing, tension, this, created, both, winners, and, losers, although, whaley, opines, that, this, is, no, reason, to, expect, a, revolutionary, explosion, in, connection, to, luther, and, the, reformation, whaley, points, out, though, that, because, maximilian, and, charles, v, tried, to, promoted, the, interests, of, the, netherlands, after, 1500, the, hanseatic, league, was, negatively, affected, and, their, growth, relative, to, england, and, the, netherlands, declined, in, the, low, countries, during, his, regency, to, get, more, money, to, pay, for, his, campaigns, he, resorted, to, debase, coins, in, the, burgundian, mints, causing, more, conflicts, with, the, interests, of, the, estates, and, the, merchant, class, in, austria, although, this, was, never, enough, for, his, needs, his, management, of, mines, and, salt, works, proved, efficient, with, a, marked, increase, in, revenue, the, fine, silver, production, in, schwaz, increased, from, 2, 800, kg, in, 1470, to, 14, 000, kg, in, 1516, benecke, remarks, that, maximilian, was, a, ruthless, exploitative, businessman, while, hollegger, sees, him, as, a, clearheaded, manager, with, sober, cost, benefit, analysis, ultimately, he, had, to, mortgage, these, properties, to, the, fuggers, to, get, quick, cash, the, financial, price, would, ultimately, fall, on, the, austrian, population, fichtner, states, that, maximilian, s, pan, european, vision, was, very, expensive, and, his, financial, practices, antagonized, his, subjects, both, high, and, low, in, burgundy, austria, and, germany, who, tried, to, temper, his, ambitions, although, they, never, came, to, hate, the, charismatic, ruler, personally, this, was, still, modest, in, comparison, with, what, was, about, to, come, and, the, ottoman, threat, gave, the, austrians, a, reason, to, pay, for, both, economic, and, military, purposes, he, encouraged, the, mining, of, copper, silver, and, calamine, coining, brass, manufacturing, and, the, arms, industry, he, took, pains, to, protect, the, local, economy, especially, in, tyrol, where, there, was, a, mining, boom, accompanied, by, a, population, boom, although, safley, notes, that, he, also, enabled, families, like, the, hochstetters, to, exploit, the, economy, for, their, own, ends, agriculture, also, developed, significantly, except, in, lower, austria, which, suffered, from, the, war, with, matthias, corvinus, augsburg, benefitted, majorly, from, the, establishment, and, expansion, of, the, kaiserliche, reichspost, as, well, as, maximilian, s, personal, attachment, to, the, city, the, imperial, city, became, the, dominant, centre, of, early, capitalism, of, the, 16th, century, and, the, location, of, the, most, important, post, office, within, the, holy, roman, empire, from, maximilian, s, time, as, the, terminuses, of, the, first, transcontinental, post, lines, began, to, shift, from, innsbruck, to, venice, and, from, brussels, to, antwerp, in, these, cities, the, communication, system, and, the, news, market, started, to, converge, as, the, fuggers, as, well, as, other, trading, companies, based, their, most, important, branches, in, these, cities, these, traders, gained, access, to, these, systems, as, well, despite, a, widely, circulated, theory, which, holds, that, the, fuggers, themselves, operated, their, own, communication, system, in, reality, they, relied, upon, the, imperial, posts, presumably, from, the, 1490s, onwards, as, official, members, of, the, court, of, maximilian, i, leipzig, started, its, rise, into, one, of, the, largest, european, trade, fair, cities, after, maximilian, granted, them, wide, ranged, privileges, in, 1497, and, raised, their, three, markets, to, the, status, of, imperial, fair, in, 1507, traditionally, german, dynasties, had, exploited, the, potential, of, the, imperial, title, to, bring, eastern, europe, into, the, fold, in, addition, to, their, lands, north, and, south, of, the, alps, under, sigismund, holy, roman, emperor, the, house, of, luxembourg, predecessors, of, the, habsburgs, as, the, imperial, dynasty, had, managed, to, gain, an, empire, almost, comparable, in, scale, to, the, later, habsburg, empire, although, at, the, same, time, they, lost, the, kingdom, of, burgundy, and, control, over, italian, territories, their, focus, on, the, east, especially, hungary, which, was, outside, the, holy, roman, empire, and, also, gained, by, the, luxembourgs, with, a, marriage, allowed, the, new, burgundian, rulers, from, the, house, of, valois, to, foster, discontent, among, german, princes, thus, the, habsburgs, were, forced, to, refocus, their, attention, on, the, west, frederick, iii, s, cousin, and, predecessor, albert, ii, who, was, sigismund, s, son, in, law, and, heir, through, his, marriage, with, elizabeth, of, luxembourg, had, managed, to, combine, the, crowns, of, germany, hungary, bohemia, and, croatia, under, his, rule, but, he, died, young, during, his, rule, maximilian, had, a, double, focus, on, both, the, east, and, the, west, the, successful, expansion, with, the, notable, role, of, marriage, policy, under, maximilian, bolstered, his, position, in, the, empire, and, also, created, more, pressure, for, an, imperial, reform, so, that, they, could, get, more, resources, and, coordinated, help, from, the, german, territories, to, defend, their, realms, and, counter, hostile, powers, such, as, france, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, arras, maximilian, betrothed, his, three, year, old, daughter, margaret, to, the, dauphin, of, france, later, charles, viii, son, of, his, adversary, louis, xi, the, betrothal, was, the, result, of, clandestine, negotiations, between, louis, xi, and, ghent, as, maximilian, s, position, was, temporarily, weakened, by, his, wife, s, death, he, had, no, say, in, the, matter, dying, shortly, after, signing, the, treaty, of, le, verger, francis, ii, duke, of, brittany, left, his, realm, to, his, daughter, anne, in, search, of, alliances, to, protect, her, domain, from, neighboring, interests, she, betrothed, herself, to, maximilian, i, in, 1490, about, a, year, later, they, married, by, proxy, however, charles, viii, and, his, sister, anne, wanted, her, inheritance, for, france, so, when, the, former, came, of, age, in, 1491, and, taking, advantage, of, maximilian, and, his, father, s, interest, in, the, succession, of, their, adversary, mathias, corvinus, king, of, hungary, charles, repudiated, his, betrothal, to, margaret, invaded, brittany, forced, anne, of, brittany, to, repudiate, her, unconsummated, marriage, to, maximilian, and, married, her, himself, margaret, then, remained, in, france, as, a, hostage, of, sorts, until, 1493, when, she, was, finally, returned, to, her, father, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, senlis, in, the, same, year, as, the, hostilities, of, the, lengthy, italian, wars, with, france, were, in, preparation, maximilian, contracted, another, marriage, for, himself, this, time, to, bianca, maria, sforza, daughter, of, galeazzo, maria, sforza, duke, of, milan, with, the, intercession, of, his, brother, ludovico, sforza, then, regent, of, the, duchy, after, the, former, s, death, in, the, east, maximilian, faced, the, need, to, reduce, the, growing, pressures, on, the, empire, brought, about, by, treaties, between, the, rulers, of, france, poland, hungary, bohemia, and, russia, as, well, as, to, bolster, his, dynasty, s, position, temporarily, threatened, by, the, union, between, anne, of, foix, candale, and, vladislaus, ii, of, hungary, in, addition, to, resistance, of, the, hungarian, magnates, in, bohemia, and, hungary, that, the, habsburgs, claimed, through, inheritance, and, overlordship, maximilian, met, with, the, jagiellonian, kings, ladislaus, ii, of, hungary, and, bohemia, and, sigismund, i, of, poland, at, the, first, congress, of, vienna, in, 1515, there, they, arranged, for, maximilian, s, granddaughter, mary, to, marry, louis, the, son, of, ladislaus, and, for, anne, the, sister, of, louis, to, marry, maximilian, s, grandson, ferdinand, both, grandchildren, being, the, children, of, philip, the, handsome, maximilian, s, son, and, joanna, of, castile, the, marriages, arranged, there, brought, habsburg, kingship, over, hungary, and, bohemia, in, 1526, in, 1515, louis, was, adopted, by, maximilian, maximilian, had, to, serve, as, the, proxy, groom, to, anna, in, the, betrothal, ceremony, because, only, in, 1516, did, ferdinand, agree, to, enter, into, the, marriage, which, would, happen, in, 1521, these, political, marriages, were, summed, up, in, the, following, latin, elegiac, couplet, reportedly, spoken, by, matthias, corvinus, bella, gerant, ali, t, f, lix, austria, n, be, nam, quae, mars, ali, s, dat, tibi, regna, venus, let, others, wage, war, but, thou, o, happy, austria, marry, for, those, kingdoms, which, mars, gives, to, others, venus, gives, to, thee, contrary, to, the, implication, of, this, motto, though, maximilian, waged, war, aplenty, in, four, decades, of, ruling, he, waged, 27, wars, in, total, late, in, his, life, though, only, the, military, situation, in, the, east, worked, well, the, magyars, was, said, to, fear, him, more, than, the, turks, or, the, devil, in, the, west, he, could, do, no, more, than, blocking, french, expansion, and, only, with, spanish, aid, his, general, strategy, was, to, combine, his, intricate, systems, of, alliance, military, threats, and, offers, of, marriage, to, realize, his, expansionist, ambitions, using, overtures, to, russia, maximilian, succeeded, in, coercing, bohemia, hungary, and, poland, into, acquiesce, in, the, habsburgs, expansionist, plans, combining, this, tactic, with, military, threats, he, was, able, to, gain, the, favourable, marriage, arrangements, in, hungary, and, bohemia, which, were, under, the, same, dynasty, according, to, bence, p, terfi, many, hungarian, nobles, maintained, dual, loyalty, to, both, the, habsburgs, and, the, jagiellons, after, the, peace, of, pressburg, 1491, legalized, this, phenomenon, there, was, a, change, in, dynamic, while, at, the, time, of, the, conflicts, between, frederick, iii, and, matthias, corvinus, it, was, primarily, those, who, took, the, side, of, the, hungarian, king, who, were, able, to, pursue, successful, careers, after, 1491, the, situation, reversed, and, those, who, were, on, the, side, of, the, habsburgs, seemed, to, have, more, opportunities, at, the, same, time, his, sprawling, panoply, of, territories, as, well, as, potential, claims, constituted, a, threat, to, france, thus, forcing, maximilian, to, continuously, launch, wars, in, defense, of, his, possessions, in, burgundy, the, low, countries, and, italy, against, four, generations, of, french, kings, louis, xi, charles, viii, louis, xii, francis, i, coalitions, he, assembled, for, this, purpose, sometimes, consisted, of, non, imperial, actors, like, england, edward, j, watts, comments, that, the, nature, of, these, wars, was, dynastic, rather, than, imperial, fortune, was, also, a, factor, that, helped, to, bring, about, the, results, of, his, marriage, plans, the, double, marriage, could, have, given, the, jagiellon, a, claim, in, austria, while, a, potential, male, child, of, margaret, and, john, a, prince, of, spain, would, have, had, a, claim, to, a, portion, of, the, maternal, grandfather, s, possessions, as, well, but, as, it, turned, out, vladislaus, s, male, line, became, extinct, while, the, frail, john, died, without, offspring, so, maximilian, s, male, line, was, able, to, claim, the, thrones, during, his, last, years, maximilian, began, to, focus, on, the, question, of, his, succession, his, goal, was, to, secure, the, throne, for, charles, according, to, the, traditional, view, a, credit, of, one, million, gulden, was, provided, to, charles, after, maximilian, s, death, according, to, wiesflecker, and, koenigsberger, by, the, fuggers, the, cortes, had, voted, over, 600, 000, crowns, for, charles, s, election, campaign, but, money, from, spain, could, not, arrive, quick, enough, which, was, used, for, advertising, and, to, bribe, the, prince, electors, and, that, this, was, the, decisive, factor, in, charles, s, successful, election, others, point, out, that, while, the, electors, were, paid, this, was, not, the, reason, for, the, outcome, or, at, most, played, only, a, small, part, the, important, factor, that, swayed, the, final, decision, was, that, frederick, refused, the, offer, and, made, a, speech, in, support, of, charles, on, the, ground, that, they, needed, a, strong, leader, against, the, ottomans, charles, had, the, resources, and, was, a, prince, of, german, extraction, the, death, of, maximilian, in, 1519, seemed, to, put, the, succession, at, risk, but, in, a, few, months, the, election, of, charles, v, was, secured, in, 1501, maximilian, fell, from, his, horse, and, badly, injured, his, leg, causing, him, pain, for, the, rest, of, his, life, some, historians, have, suggested, that, maximilian, was, morbidly, depressed, from, 1514, he, travelled, everywhere, with, his, coffin, in, 1518, feeling, his, death, near, after, seeing, an, eclipse, he, returned, to, his, beloved, innsbruck, but, the, city, s, innskeepers, and, purveyors, did, not, grant, the, emperor, s, entourage, further, credit, the, resulting, fit, led, to, a, stroke, that, left, him, bedridden, on, 15, december, 1518, however, he, continued, to, read, documents, and, received, foreign, envoys, right, until, the, end, maximilian, died, in, wels, upper, austria, at, three, o, clock, in, the, morning, on, 12, january, 1519, different, historians, have, listed, different, diseases, as, the, main, cause, of, death, including, cancer, likely, stomach, cancer, or, intestinal, cancer, pneumonia, syphilis, gall, stones, stroke, he, did, have, a, combination, of, dangerous, medical, problems, etc, maximilian, was, succeeded, as, emperor, by, his, grandson, charles, v, his, son, philip, the, handsome, having, died, in, 1506, for, penitential, reasons, maximilian, gave, very, specific, instructions, for, the, treatment, of, his, body, after, death, he, wanted, his, hair, to, be, cut, off, and, his, teeth, knocked, out, and, the, body, was, to, be, whipped, and, covered, with, lime, and, ash, wrapped, in, linen, and, publicly, displayed, to, show, the, perishableness, of, all, earthly, glory, gregor, reisch, the, emperor, s, friend, and, confessor, who, closed, his, eyes, did, not, obey, the, instruction, though, he, placed, a, rosary, in, maximilian, s, hand, and, other, sacred, objects, near, the, corpse, he, was, buried, in, the, castle, chapel, at, wiener, neustadt, on, borrowed, money, the, casket, was, opened, during, renovation, under, maria, theresa, after, that, the, body, was, reinterred, in, a, baroque, sarcophagus, that, later, was, found, unscathed, amidst, the, wreckage, of, the, chapel, due, to, the, second, world, war, on, 6, august, 1946, the, emperor, was, ceremoniously, buried, again, in, 1950, despite, his, reputation, as, the, last, knight, and, his, penchant, for, personally, commanding, battles, and, leading, a, peripatetic, court, as, a, politician, maximilian, also, carried, out, herculean, tasks, of, bureaucracy, every, day, of, his, adult, life, the, emperor, boasted, that, he, could, dictate, simultaneously, to, half, a, dozen, secretaries, at, the, same, time, james, m, bradburne, remarks, that, naturally, every, ruler, wanted, to, be, seen, as, a, victor, but, maximilian, aspired, to, the, role, of, apollo, musagetes, the, circle, of, humanists, gathered, around, him, and, other, contemporary, admirers, also, tended, to, depict, him, as, such, maximilian, was, a, universal, patron, whose, intellect, and, imagination, according, to, historian, sydney, anglo, made, the, courtier, of, castiliogne, look, like, a, scaled, down, version, anglo, points, out, though, that, the, emperor, treated, his, artists, and, scholars, like, mere, tools, whom, he, also, tended, to, fail, to, pay, adequately, or, timely, to, serve, his, purposes, and, never, autonomous, forces, maximilian, did, not, play, the, roles, of, the, sponsor, and, commissioner, only, but, as, organizer, stimulator, and, planner, he, joined, the, creative, processes, drew, up, the, programmes, suggested, improvements, checked, and, decided, on, the, details, invented, devices, almost, regardless, of, the, time, and, material, resources, required, his, creativity, was, not, limited, to, the, practical, issues, of, politics, economy, and, war, but, extended, to, the, areas, of, arts, sciences, hunting, fishing, and, especially, technical, innovations, incl, ding, the, creation, of, all, kinds, of, military, equipment, fortifications, precious, metal, processing, or, the, mining, industry, these, activities, though, were, time, consuming, and, the, effort, the, emperor, poured, in, such, activities, was, sometimes, criticized, as, excessive, or, that, they, distracted, him, from, the, main, tasks, of, a, ruler, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, early, twentieth, century, some, even, criticized, him, for, possessing, the, qualities, that, befitted, a, genius, more, than, a, ruler, or, that, his, intellect, that, saw, too, far, made, him, unwisely, try, to, force, the, march, of, time, maximilian, was, a, capable, commander, and, a, military, innovator, who, contributed, to, the, modernization, of, warfare, although, he, lost, many, wars, usually, due, to, the, lack, of, financial, resources, the, notable, commentators, of, his, time, including, machiavelli, piero, vettori, and, guicciardini, rated, him, as, a, great, general, or, in, the, words, of, machivelli, second, to, none, but, pointed, out, that, extravagance, terrible, management, of, financial, resources, and, other, character, defects, tended, to, lead, to, the, failures, of, grand, schemes, according, to, matthias, pfaffenbichler, he, did, not, accept, the, truth, that, war, depended, on, money, and, thus, the, problem, was, that, despite, his, military, tactical, talents, he, rarely, managed, to, convert, military, victories, into, long, term, political, successes, he, and, his, condottiero, george, von, frundsberg, organized, the, first, formations, of, the, landsknechte, based, on, inspiration, from, swiss, pikemen, but, increased, the, ratio, of, pikemen, and, favoured, handgunners, over, the, crossbowmen, with, new, tactics, being, developed, leading, to, improvement, in, performance, discipline, drilling, and, a, highly, developed, staff, by, the, standard, of, the, era, were, also, instilled, the, war, apparatus, he, created, later, played, an, essential, role, in, austria, s, rank, as, great, power, maximilian, was, the, founder, and, organiser, of, the, arms, industry, of, the, habsburgs, he, started, the, standardization, of, the, artillery, according, to, the, weight, of, the, cannonballs, and, made, them, more, mobile, he, sponsored, new, types, of, cannons, initiated, many, innovations, that, improved, the, range, and, damage, so, that, cannons, worked, better, against, thick, walls, and, concerned, himself, with, the, metallurgy, as, cannons, often, exploded, when, ignited, and, caused, damage, among, his, own, troops, according, to, contemporary, accounts, he, could, field, an, artillery, of, 105, cannons, including, both, iron, and, bronze, guns, of, various, sizes, the, artillery, force, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, most, developed, of, the, day, the, arsenal, in, innsbruck, created, by, maximilian, was, one, of, the, most, notable, artillery, arsenals, in, europe, his, typical, tactic, was, artillery, should, attack, first, the, cavalry, would, act, as, shock, troops, and, attack, the, flanks, infantry, fought, in, tightly, knitted, formation, at, the, middle, a, figure, who, contributed, greatly, to, the, development, of, the, innsbruck, arsenal, was, gregor, l, ffler, he, entered, maximilian, s, service, in, 1513, following, in, the, footsteps, of, his, father, peter, his, son, hans, christoph, would, also, be, the, leading, gunfounder, in, europe, l, ffler, was, the, first, gun, master, who, became, an, arms, manufacturer, who, produced, weapons, on, an, industrial, scale, and, was, also, responsible, for, casting, many, of, the, statues, in, maximilian, s, cenotaph, in, addition, to, the, central, arsenal, in, innsbruck, maximilian, built, a, chain, of, arsenals, to, protect, his, border, those, in, sigmundskron, and, trent, against, italians, in, lindau, against, the, swiss, in, breisach, against, the, french, in, vienna, against, the, hungarians, in, graz, hochosterwitz, laibach, gorizia, against, the, turks, and, venetians, in, addition, there, were, the, old, burgundian, arsenals, against, france, on, the, other, hand, wilfried, tittmann, stresses, the, central, importance, of, the, arms, manufacturing, center, in, nuremberg, where, the, earliest, handguns, which, proved, suitable, for, the, field, and, export, were, developed, not, only, concerning, maximilian, s, military, system, but, also, the, early, modern, military, revolution, in, general, puype, notices, that, tittmann, and, eugen, heer, share, the, view, that, maximilian, s, industrialization, policy, made, nuremberg, the, metropole, of, the, upper, german, armament, industry, marius, mutz, opines, that, tittmann, s, demonstration, of, nuremberg, s, importance, is, generally, convincing, but, that, some, of, his, points, notably, that, hans, kalteisen, who, served, maximilian, and, was, l, ffler, s, rival, had, a, nuremberg, origin, or, that, developments, in, innsbruck, were, based, on, nuremberg, s, technology, as, well, are, a, bit, overambitious, maximilian, was, described, by, the, nineteenth, century, politician, anton, alexander, graf, von, auersperg, as, the, last, knight, der, letzte, ritter, and, this, epithet, has, stuck, to, him, some, historians, note, that, the, epithet, rings, true, yet, is, ironic, because, as, the, father, of, the, landsknechte, of, which, the, paternity, he, shared, with, george, von, frundsberg, and, the, first, cannoneer, of, the, nation, he, ended, the, combat, supremacy, of, the, cavalry, and, his, death, heralded, the, military, revolution, of, the, next, two, centuries, moreover, his, multifaceted, reforms, broke, the, back, of, the, knight, class, both, militarily, and, politically, he, threw, his, own, weight, behind, the, promotion, of, the, infantry, soldier, leading, them, in, battles, on, foot, with, a, pike, on, his, shoulder, and, giving, the, commanders, honours, and, titles, to, maximilian, the, rise, of, the, new, martial, ethic, including, even, its, violent, aspect, associated, with, the, rise, of, the, landsknechte, was, also, an, unextractable, part, of, his, own, masculine, identity, he, believed, that, fighting, alongside, his, foot, soldiers, legitimized, his, right, to, rule, more, than, did, any, noble, trapping, or, title, in, his, time, though, social, tensions, were, brewing, and, the, nobles, resisted, this, belief, at, the, siege, of, padua, 1509, commanding, a, french, german, allied, army, maximilian, ordered, the, noble, knights, to, dismount, to, help, the, landsknechte, to, storm, a, breach, but, chevalier, bayard, criticized, him, for, putting, noblemen, at, risk, alongside, cobblers, blacksmiths, bakers, and, laborers, and, who, do, not, hold, their, honor, in, like, esteem, as, gentlemen, even, merely, mixing, the, two, on, the, same, battlefield, was, considered, insulting, the, french, then, refused, to, obey, the, siege, broke, when, the, german, knights, refused, to, continue, their, assaults, on, foot, and, demanded, to, fight, on, horseback, also, on, basis, of, status, a, furious, maximilian, left, the, camp, and, ordered, the, army, to, retreat, with, maximilian, s, establishment, and, use, of, the, landsknechte, the, military, organisation, in, germany, was, altered, in, a, major, way, here, began, the, rise, of, military, enterprisers, who, raised, mercenaries, with, a, system, of, subcontractors, to, make, war, on, credit, and, acted, as, the, commanding, generals, of, their, own, armies, maximilian, became, an, expert, military, enterpriser, himself, leading, his, father, to, consider, him, a, spendthrift, military, adventurer, who, wandered, into, new, wars, and, debts, while, still, recovering, from, the, previous, campaigns, regarding, the, cavalry, in, 1500, using, the, french, gendarmes, as, a, model, he, organized, his, heavy, cavalry, called, the, kyrisser, these, cavalrymen, still, mostly, noblemen, were, still, fully, armed, but, more, lightly, these, were, the, predecessors, of, cuirassiers, non, nobles, began, to, be, accepted, into, the, cavalry, mostly, serving, as, light, cavalry, each, lanze, or, lance, contained, one, kyrisser, and, six, to, seven, light, cavalrymen, and, occasionally, he, knighted, them, too, for, heavy, as, well, as, light, cavalry, firearms, began, to, replace, cold, weapons, in, military, medicine, maximilian, introduced, structured, triage, triage, itself, had, existed, since, the, ancient, egypt, it, was, in, his, armies, that, the, wounded, was, first, categorized, and, treated, according, to, an, order, of, priority, in, times, of, war, higher, priority, was, given, to, military, personnel, over, civilians, and, the, higher, ranked, over, the, lower, ranked, the, practice, spread, to, other, armies, in, the, following, centuries, and, coined, triage, by, the, french, during, the, middle, age, european, armies, tended, to, bring, with, them, workers, who, served, the, soldiers, both, as, barbers, this, was, their, chief, function, thus, the, origin, of, their, name, in, german, feldscherer, or, field, shearer, and, low, skilled, paramedics, as, opposed, to, a, trained, medicus, who, worked, on, their, external, wounds, beginning, with, maximilian, each, captain, of, a, detachment, of, 200, 500, men, was, compelled, to, bring, a, capable, feldscherer, and, provide, him, with, medicine, and, equipments, these, paramedics, were, subject, to, a, level, of, control, under, a, oberfeldarzt, chief, field, doctor, although, their, organization, was, not, stabilized, until, the, seventeenth, century, and, it, also, took, a, long, time, before, the, average, level, of, these, paramedics, was, raised, substantially, the, birth, of, the, modern, feldsher, led, to, the, formation, of, a, military, medical, service, whose, primary, task, other, than, giving, first, aid, was, to, transport, the, wounded, out, of, the, battlefield, as, fast, as, possible, with, palanquins, and, wheelbarrows, the, emperor, would, not, live, to, see, the, fruits, of, his, military, reforms, which, were, also, widely, adopted, by, the, territories, in, the, empire, and, other, nations, in, europe, moreover, the, landsknechte, s, mode, of, fighting, boosted, the, strength, of, the, territorial, polities, while, more, centralized, nations, were, able, to, utilize, them, in, ways, german, rulers, could, not, kleinschmidt, concludes, that, in, the, end, maximilian, did, good, service, to, the, competitors, of, his, own, grandson, while, favouring, more, modern, methods, in, his, actual, military, undertakings, maximilian, had, a, genuine, interest, in, promoting, chivalric, traditions, like, the, tournament, being, an, exceptional, jouster, himself, the, tournaments, helped, to, enhance, his, personal, image, and, solidify, a, network, of, princes, and, nobles, over, whom, he, kept, a, close, watch, fostering, fidelity, and, fraternity, among, the, competitors, taking, inspiration, from, the, burgundy, tournament, he, developed, the, german, tournament, into, a, distinctive, entity, in, addition, during, at, least, two, occasions, in, his, campaigns, he, challenged, and, killed, french, knights, in, duel, like, preludes, to, battles, knights, reacted, to, their, decreased, condition, and, loss, of, privileges, in, different, ways, some, asserted, their, traditional, rights, in, violent, ways, and, became, robber, knights, like, g, tz, von, berlichingen, the, knights, as, a, social, group, became, an, obstacle, to, maximilian, s, law, and, order, and, the, relationship, between, them, and, the, last, knight, became, antagonistic, some, probably, also, felt, slighted, by, the, way, imperial, propaganda, presented, maximilian, as, the, sole, defender, of, knightly, values, in, the, diet, of, worms, in, 1495, the, emperor, the, archbishops, great, princes, and, free, cities, joined, force, to, initiate, the, perpetual, land, peace, ewige, landfriede, forbidding, all, private, feuding, in, order, to, protect, the, rising, tide, of, commerce, the, tournament, sponsored, by, the, emperor, was, thus, a, tool, to, appease, the, knights, although, it, became, a, recreational, yet, still, deadly, extreme, sport, after, spending, 20, years, creating, and, supporting, policies, against, the, knights, though, maximilian, changed, his, ways, and, began, trying, to, engage, them, to, integrate, them, into, his, frame, of, rulership, in, 1517, he, lifted, the, ban, on, franz, von, sickingen, a, leading, figure, among, the, knights, and, took, him, into, his, service, in, the, same, year, he, summoned, the, rhenish, knights, and, introduced, his, ritterrecht, knight, s, rights, which, would, provide, the, free, knight, with, a, special, law, court, in, exchange, of, their, oaths, for, being, obedient, to, the, emperor, and, abstaining, from, evil, deeds, he, did, not, succeed, in, collecting, taxes, from, them, or, creating, a, knights, association, but, an, ideology, or, frame, emerged, that, allowed, the, knights, to, retain, their, freedom, while, fostering, the, relationship, between, the, crown, and, the, sword, maximilian, had, a, great, passion, for, armour, not, only, as, equipment, for, battle, or, tournaments, but, as, an, art, form, he, prided, himself, on, his, armor, designing, expertise, and, knowledge, of, metallurgy, under, his, patronage, the, art, of, the, armorer, blossomed, like, never, before, master, armorers, across, europe, like, lorenz, helmschmid, konrad, seusenhofer, franck, scroo, and, daniel, hopfer, who, was, the, first, to, etch, on, iron, as, part, of, an, artistic, process, using, an, acid, wash, created, custom, made, armors, that, often, served, as, extravagant, gifts, to, display, maximilian, s, generosity, and, devices, that, would, produce, special, effects, often, initiated, by, the, emperor, himself, in, tournaments, the, style, of, armour, that, became, popular, during, the, second, half, of, his, reign, featured, elaborate, fluting, and, metalworking, and, became, known, as, maximilian, armour, it, emphasized, the, details, in, the, shaping, of, the, metal, itself, rather, than, the, etched, or, gilded, designs, popular, in, the, milanese, style, maximilian, also, gave, a, bizarre, jousting, helmet, as, a, gift, to, king, henry, viii, the, helmet, s, visor, features, a, human, face, with, eyes, nose, and, a, grinning, mouth, and, was, modelled, after, the, appearance, of, maximilian, himself, it, also, sports, a, pair, of, curled, ram, s, horns, brass, spectacles, and, even, etched, beard, stubble, knowing, that, the, extinct, treizsaurbeyn, likely, treitzsauerwein, family, had, a, method, to, make, extra, tough, armours, that, could, not, be, shot, through, by, any, crossbow, he, sought, their, servant, caspar, riederer, who, helped, konrad, seusenhofer, to, recreate, the, armour, type, with, knowledge, gained, from, riederer, maximilian, invented, a, method, so, that, in, his, workshops, 30, front, and, back, plates, could, be, made, at, once, in, order, to, help, his, soldiers, and, especially, his, landsknechte, the, details, of, the, process, described, are, currently, not, known, but, likely, utilizing, matrices, with, where, armour, parts, could, be, stamped, out, from, sheet, metal, maximilian, associated, the, practical, art, of, hunting, as, well, as, fishing, and, falconry, with, his, status, as, prince, and, knight, he, introduced, parforce, and, park, hunting, to, germany, he, also, published, essays, on, these, topics, in, this, he, followed, frederick, ii, hohenstaufen, and, was, equally, attentive, to, naturalist, details, but, less, scientific, his, tyrol, fishery, book, tiroler, fischereibuch, was, composed, with, the, help, from, his, fish, master, martin, fritz, and, wolfgang, hohenleiter, to, keep, fish, fresh, he, invented, a, special, kind, of, fish, container, while, he, was, unconcerned, with, the, disappearance, or, weakening, of, the, knight, class, due, to, the, development, of, artillery, and, infantry, maximilian, worried, greatly, about, the, vulnerability, of, ibexes, described, by, him, as, noble, creatures, in, front, of, handguns, and, criticized, the, peasants, in, particular, for, having, no, moderation, in, 1517, the, emperor, banned, the, manufacturing, and, possession, of, the, wheellock, which, was, designed, and, especially, effective, for, hunting, another, possible, reason, for, this, earliest, attempt, at, gun, control, might, be, related, to, worries, about, the, spreading, of, crimes, he, investigated, classified, and, protected, game, reserves, which, also, damaged, the, farmers, crops, as, he, forbade, them, to, erect, fences, game, population, quickly, increased, though, in, one, case, he, became, an, unintentional, species, conservationist, as, he, had, tyrolean, mountain, lakes, stocked, with, trouts, a, variety, of, the, last, trout, originating, from, the, danube, the, kaiser, max, trout, has, survived, until, this, day, in, gossenk, llesee, since, he, was, young, in, germany, and, especially, in, the, low, countries, he, paid, attention, to, the, burghers, art, of, archery, joined, archery, competitions, and, gave, patronage, to, crossbow, and, archery, guilds, in, military, affairs, though, he, officially, abolished, the, crossbow, in, 1517, despite, its, continued, use, in, other, countries, although, he, never, gained, complete, popular, support, in, flanders, these, patronage, activities, helped, him, to, build, up, a, relationship, with, guild, members, who, participated, in, his, campaigns, notably, for, guinegate, 1479, and, rally, urban, support, during, his, time, in, the, low, countries, his, name, heads, the, list, of, lords, in, the, huge, 1488, saint, george, guild, book, in, ghent, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, he, built, a, guildhouse, for, the, st, sebastian, s, archers, at, the, hague, the, 1511, landlibell, a, military, statue, and, a, cornerstone, of, tyrol, s, democracy, which, established, the, foundation, for, tyrol, s, separate, defence, organization, by, exempting, the, population, from, military, service, outside, their, borders, but, requiring, them, to, serve, in, the, defence, of, their, region, and, recognizing, the, connection, between, freedom, and, the, rights, to, bear, arms, which, remained, largely, in, effect, until, the, fall, of, monarchy, led, to, the, establishment, of, armed, militia, formations, called, tiroler, sch, tzen, the, term, sch, tzen, had, been, used, to, refer, to, men, armed, with, crossbows, but, maximilian, enthusiastically, encouraged, riflemen, and, firearms, these, formations, still, exist, although, they, have, become, non, governmental, since, 1918, in, 2019, they, organized, a, great, shooting, event, in, commemoration, of, the, emperor, another, art, associated, with, chivalry, and, military, activities, was, dancing, as, the, landsknechte, s, fighting, techniques, were, developed, they, no, longer, preferred, fighting, along, a, straight, line, as, exercised, by, even, the, swiss, until, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, but, leaned, towards, a, circle, wise, movement, that, enhanced, the, use, of, the, space, around, the, combatant, and, allowed, them, to, attack, the, opponents, from, different, angles, the, circle, wise, formation, described, by, jean, molinet, as, the, snail, would, become, the, hallmark, of, landsknechte, s, combat, the, new, types, of, combat, also, required, the, maintenance, of, a, stable, bodily, equilibrium, maximilian, an, innovator, of, these, types, of, movements, also, saw, value, in, their, effects, over, the, maintenance, of, group, discipline, apart, from, the, control, of, centralized, institutions, as, maximilian, and, his, commanders, sought, to, popularize, these, forms, of, movements, which, only, became, daily, practice, at, the, end, of, the, fifteen, century, and, gained, dominance, after, maximilian, s, death, in, 1519, he, promoted, them, in, tournaments, in, fencing, and, in, dancing, as, well, which, started, to, focus, on, steps, and, the, movements, of, the, feet, over, the, movements, of, the, head, and, the, arms, the, courtly, festivals, became, a, playground, for, innovations, foreshadowing, developemts, in, military, practices, regarding, dancing, other, elements, favoured, by, maximilian, s, court, were, the, moriskentan, moors, dance, morris, dance, or, moresca, the, masquerades, mummerei, and, the, use, of, torchbearers, torchbearers, are, a, part, of, almost, all, of, the, illustrated, costumed, circle, dances, in, the, weisskunig, and, freydal, with, maximilian, himself, usually, being, one, of, them, masquerades, usually, included, dancing, to, the, music, of, fifes, and, drums, performed, by, the, same, musicians, who, served, the, new, infantry, forces, the, famous, humanist, philosopher, julius, caesar, scaliger, who, grew, up, as, a, page, at, maximilian, s, court, reportedly, performed, the, pyrrhic, war, dance, which, he, reconstructed, from, ancient, sources, in, front, of, the, emperor, the, annual, t, nzelfest, the, oldest, children, s, festival, in, bavaria, reportedly, founded, by, maximilian, in, 1497, the, event, only, appeared, in, written, sources, from, 1658, includes, dancing, processions, and, reenactment, of, city, life, under, maximilian, maximilian, was, a, keen, supporter, of, the, arts, and, sciences, and, he, surrounded, himself, with, scholars, such, as, joachim, vadian, and, andreas, stoberl, stiborius, promoting, them, to, important, court, posts, many, of, them, were, commissioned, to, assist, him, complete, a, series, of, projects, in, different, art, forms, intended, to, glorify, for, posterity, his, life, and, deeds, and, those, of, his, habsburg, ancestors, he, referred, to, these, projects, as, gedechtnus, memorial, which, included, a, series, of, stylised, autobiographical, works, the, epic, poems, theuerdank, and, freydal, and, the, chivalric, novel, weisskunig, both, published, in, editions, lavishly, illustrated, with, woodcuts, in, this, vein, he, commissioned, a, series, of, three, monumental, woodblock, prints, the, triumphal, arch, 1512, 18, 192, woodcut, panels, 295, cm, wide, and, 357, cm, high, approximately, 9, 8, by, 11,

including, albrecht, d, rer, albrecht, altdorfer, and, hans, burgkmair, according, to, the, last, knight, the, art, armor, and, ambition, of, maximilian, i, maximilian, dictated, large, parts, of, the, books, to, his, secretary, and, friend, marx, treitzsaurwein, who, did, the, rewriting, authors, of, the, book, emperor, maximilian, i, and, the, age, of, durer, cast, doubt, on, his, role, as, a, true, patron, of, the, arts, though, as, he, tended, to, favor, pragmatic, elements, over, high, arts, on, the, other, hand, he, was, a, perfectionist, who, involved, himself, with, every, stage, of, the, creative, processes, his, goals, extended, far, beyond, the, emperor, s, own, glorification, too, commemoration, also, included, the, documentation, in, details, of, the, presence, and, the, restoration, of, source, materials, and, precious, artifacts, notorious, for, his, micro, managing, there, was, a, notable, case, in, which, the, emperor, allowed, and, encouraged, free, ranging,

realized, and, highly, praised, by, goethe, in, 1811, in, 1504, maximilian, commissioned, the, ambraser, heldenbuch, a, compendium, of, german, medieval, narratives, the, majority, was, heroic, epics, which, was, written, by, hans, ried, the, work, was, of, great, importance, to, german, literature, because, among, its, twenty, five, narratives, fifteen, were, unique, this, would, be, the, last, time, the, nibelungenlied, was, enshrined, in, german, literature, before, being, rediscovered, again, 250, years, later, maximilian, was, also, a, patron, of, ulrich, von, hutten, whom, he, crowned, as, poet, laureate, in, 1517, and, the, humanist, willibald, pirckheimer, who, was, one, of, germany, s, most, important, patrons, of, arts, in, his, own, right, as, rex, litteratus, he, supported, all, the, literary, genres, that, had, been, supported, by, his, predecessors, in, addition, to, drama, a, genre, that, had, been, gaining, in, popularity, in, his, era, joseph, gr, npeck, attracted, his, attention, with, comoediae, duae, presumably, the, first, german, neo, latin, festival, plays, he, was, impressed, with, joseph, gr, npeck, s, streit, zwischen, virtus, und, fallacicaptrix, a, morality, play, in, which, maximilian, himself, was, asked, to, choose, between, virtue, and, base, pleasure, celtis, wrote, for, him, ludus, dianae, and, rhapsodia, de, laudibus, et, victoria, maximiliani, de, boemannis, the, ludus, dianae, displays, the, symbiotic, relationship, between, ruler, and, humanist, who, are, both, portrayed, as, apollonian, or, phoebeian, while, saturn, as,

often, doubled, as, encomium, or, dramatized, newe, zeittung, news, reports, in, support, of, imperial, or, princely, politics, douglas, a, russel, remarks, that, the, academic, mode, of, theater, associated, with, the, new, interest, humanism, and, the, classics, at, that, time, was, mainly, the, work, of, konrad, celtis, joachim, von, watt, who, was, a, poet, laureate, crowned, by, maximilian, and, at, age, 32, was, rector, at, the, university, of, vienna, and, benedictus, chelidonius, william, cecil, mcdonald, comments, that, in, the, context, of, german, medieval, literary, patronage, maximilian, s, literary, activities, not, only, summarize, the, literary, patronage, of, the, middle, ages, but, also, represent, a, point, of, departure, a, beacon, for, a, new, age, moreover, like, charlemagne, otto, the, great, henry, ii, and, frederick, barbarossa, maximilian, was, a, fostering, spirit, i, e, he, not, only, commissioned, literature, but, through, his, policies, and, the, force, of, his, personality, he, created, a, climate, conducive, to, the, flowering, of, the, arts, under, his, rule, the, university, of, vienna, reached, its, apogee, as, a, centre, of, humanistic, thought, he, established, the, college, of, poets, and, mathematicians, which, was, incorporated, into, the, university, maximilian, invited, conrad, celtis, the, leading, german, scientist, of, their, day, to, university, of, vienna, celtis, found, the, sodalitas, litteraria, danubiana, which, was, also, supported, by, maximilian, an, association, of, scholars, from, the, danube, area, to, support, literature, and, humanist, thought, maximilian, also, promoted, the, development, of, the, young, habsburg, university, of, freiburg, and, its, host, city, in, consideration, of, the, city, s, strategic, position, he, gave, the, city, privileges, helped, it, to, turn, the, corner, financially, while, utilizing, the, university, s, professors, for, important, diplomatic, missions, and, key, positions, at, the, court, the, chancellor, konrad, st, rtzel, twice, the, university, s, rector, acted, as, the, bridge, between, maximilian, and, freiburg, maximilian, supported, and, utilized, the, humanists, partly, for, propaganda, effect, partly, for, his, genealogical, projects, but, he, also, employed, several, as, secretaries, and, counsellors, in, their, selection, he, rejected, class, barriers, believing, that, intelligent, minds, deriving, their, nobility, from, god, even, if, this, caused, conflicts, even, physical, attacks, with, the, nobles, he, relied, on, his, humanists, to, create, a, nationalistic, imperial, myth, in, order, to, unify, the, reich, against, the, french, in, italy, as, pretext, for, a, later, crusade, the, estates, protested, against, investing, their, resources, in, italy, though, maximilian, told, his, electors, each, to, establish, a, university, in, their, realm, thus, in, 1502, and, 1506, together, with, the, elector, of, saxony, and, the, elector, of, brandenburg, respectively, he, co, found, the, university, of, wittenberg, and, the, university, of, frankfurt, the, university, of, wittenberg, was, the, first, german, university, established, without, a, papal, bull, signifying, the, secular, imperial, authority, concerning, universities, this, first, center, in, the, north, where, old, latin, scholarly, traditions, were, overthrown, would, become, the, home, of, luther, and, melanchthon, as, he, was, too, distant, his, patronage, of, humanism, and, humanistic, books, in, particular, did, not, reach, the, netherlands, and, as, mary, of, burgundy, died, too, young, while, philip, the, fair, and, charles, v, were, educated, in, the, burgundian, tradition, there, was, no, sovereign, who, fostered, humanistic, latin, culture, in, the, netherlands, although, they, had, their, own, mode, of, learning, there, were, exchanges, and, arguments, over, political, ideas, and, values, between, the, two, sides, though, maximilian, greatly, admired, his, father, in, law, charles, the, bold, he, even, adopted, charles, s, motto, as, one, of, his, own, namely, i, dared, it, or, je, l, ay, emprint, and, promoted, his, conception, that, the, sovereign, s, power, and, magnificence, came, directly, from, god, and, not, through, the, mediation, of, the, church, this, concept, was, part, of, maximilian, s, political, program, including, other, elements, such, as, the, recovery, of, italy, the, position, of, the, emperor, as, dominus, mundi, expansionism, the, crusade, etc, supported, in, the, netherlands, by, paul, of, middelburg, but, considered, extreme, by, erasmus, concerning, heroic, models, that, rulers, should, follow, especially, concerning, the, education, of, archduke, charles, who, would, later, be, influenced, much, by, his, grandfather, s, knightly, image, antoine, haneron, proposed, ancient, heroes, above, all, alexander, who, charles, adopted, as, a, great, role, model, for, all, his, life, while, molinet, presented, alexander, caesar, and, semiramis, but, erasmus, protested, alexander, caesar, and, xerxes, as, models, maximilian, strongly, promoted, the, first, two, though, as, well, as, st, george, both, in, frederican, and, burgundian, forms, the, idea, of, peace, also, became, more, pronounced, in, maximilian, s, court, in, his, last, years, though, likely, influenced, by, flemish, humanism, especially, erasmian, maximilian, himself, was, an, unabashed, warlike, prince, but, late, in, his, life, he, believed, that, his, 27, wars, only, served, the, devil, responding, to, the, intense, burgundian, humanistic, discourse, on, nobility, by, birth, and, nobility, by, virtue, the, emperor, pushed, his, own, modification, office, versus, birth, with, a, strong, emphasis, on, the, primacy, of, office, over, birth, noflatscher, opines, that, the, emperor, was, probably, the, most, important, mediator, of, the, burgundian, model, himself, with, bianca, maria, also, having, influence, although, she, could, only, partially, fulfill, her, role, the, italian, philosopher, gianfrancesco, pico, della, mirandola, dedicated, his, 1500, work, de, imaginatione, a, treatise, on, the, human, mind, in, which, he, synthesized, aristotle, neoplatonism, and, girolamo, savonarola, to, maximilian, the, italian, philosopher, and, theologian, tommaso, radini, tedeschi, also, dedicated, his, 1511, work, la, calipsychia, sive, de, pulchritudine, animae, to, the, emperor, in, philosophy, besides, humanism, esotericism, had, a, notable, influence, during, maximilian, s, time, in, 1505, he, sent, johannes, trithemius, eight, questions, concerning, spiritual, and, religious, matters, questions, 3, 5, 6, 7, were, concerned, with, witchcraft, that, trithemius, answered, and, later, published, in, the, 1515, book, liber, octo, questionum, books, of, eight, questions, maximilian, displayed, a, skeptical, aspect, posing, questions, such, as, why, god, permitted, witches, and, their, powers, to, control, evil, spirits, the, authors, now, usually, identified, as, heinrich, kramer, alone, of, the, most, notorious, work, on, witchcraft, of, the, time, malleus, maleficarum, claimed, that, they, had, his, letter, of, approval, supposedly, issued, in, november, 1486, to, act, as, inquisitors, but, according, to, behringer, durrant, and, bailey, he, likely, never, supported, them, although, kramer, apparently, went, to, brussels, the, burgundian, capital, in, 1486, hoping, to, influence, the, young, king, they, did, not, dare, to, involve, frederick, iii, whom, kramer, had, offended, some, years, earlier, trithemius, dedicated, the, de, septem, secundeis, the, seven, secondary, intelligences, which, argued, that, the, cycle, of, ages, was, ruled, by, seven, planetary, angels, in, addition, to, god, the, first, intelligence, the, historian, martin, hollegger, notes, though, that, maximilian, himself, did, not, share, the, cyclical, view, of, history, typical, for, their, contemporaries, nor, believed, that, their, age, would, be, the, last, age, he, had, a, linear, understanding, of, time, that, progresses, would, make, the, world, better, the, kabbalistic, elements, in, the, court, as, well, as, trithemius, himself, influenced, the, thinking, of, the, famous, polymath, and, occultist, heinrich, cornelius, agrippa, who, in, maximilian, s, time, served, mainly, as, secretary, soldier, and, diplomatic, spy, the, emperor, having, interest, in, the, occult, himself, intended, to, write, two, books, on, magic, zauberpuech, and, black, magic, schwartzcunnstpuech, but, did, not, have, time, for, them, like, his, father, maximilian, was, an, alchemist, who, at, times, locked, himself, up, in, his, room, for, days, to, experiment, he, collaborated, with, his, sister, in, law, caterina, sforza, her, work, experiments, records, a, recipe, for, an, emetic, powder, attributed, to, him, he, sponsored, such, experiments, too, according, to, leonhard, thurneysser, in, 1499, an, alchemist, named, schwichard, fronberger, set, up, for, him, an, astro, alchemical, project, that, would, theoretically, produce, silver, in, 1547, and, gold, in, 1598, maximilian, was, 40, in, 1499, in, his, circle, reisch, and, agrippa, were, also, interested, in, alchemy, although, agrippa, joined, a, secret, society, that, did, not, allow, publishing, about, this, topic, the, establishment, of, the, new, courts, and, the, formal, reception, of, roman, law, in, 1495, led, to, the, formation, of, a, professional, lawyer, class, as, well, as, a, bureaucratic, judiciary, legal, scholars, trained, in, mos, italicus, either, in, italian, universities, or, in, newly, established, german, universities, became, in, demand, among, the, prominent, lawyers, and, legal, scholars, who, served, maximilian, in, various, capacities, and, provided, legal, advices, to, the, emperor, were, mercurino, gattinara, sebastian, brandt, and, ulrich, zasius, together, with, the, aristocrats, and, the, literati, who, participated, in, maximilian, s, propaganda, and, intellectual, projects, the, lawyers, and, legal, scholars, became, one, of, three, main, groups, in, maximilian, s, court, konrad, st, rtzel, the, chancellor, belonged, to, this, group, in, maximilian, s, court, more, egalitarian, than, any, previous, german, or, imperial, court, with, its, burghers, and, peasants, all, these, groups, were, treated, equally, in, promotions, and, rewards, the, individuals, were, also, blending, in, many, respects, usually, through, marriage, alliances, maximilian, was, an, energetic, patron, of, the, library, previous, habsburg, rulers, such, as, albert, iii, and, maximilian, s, father, frederick, iii, who, collected, the, 110, books, that, were, the, core, inventory, of, the, later, library, had, also, been, instrumental, in, centralizing, art, treasures, and, book, collections, maximilian, became, a, bibliophile, during, the, time, he, was, in, the, low, countries, as, husband, of, mary, of, burgundy, he, would, come, into, possession, of, the, huge, burgundian, library, which, according, to, some, sources, was, brought, to, austria, when, he, returned, to, his, native, land, according, to, the, official, website, of, the, austrian, national, library, though, the, habsburgs, only, brought, the, collection, to, vienna, in, 1581, maximilian, also, inherited, the, tyrol, library, of, his, uncle, sigismund, also, a, great, cultural, patron, which, had, received, a, large, contribution, from, eleanor, of, scotland, sigismund, s, wife, and, also, a, great, lover, of, books, when, he, married, bianca, maria, italian, masterpieces, were, incorporated, into, the, collection, the, collection, became, more, organized, when, maximilian, commissioned, ladislaus, sunthaim, jakob, mennel, and, johannes, cuspinian, to, acquire, and, compose, books, by, the, beginning, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, library, had, acquired, significant, bohemian, french, and, italian, book, art, in, 1504, conrad, celtis, spoke, the, first, time, of, the, bibliotheca, regia, which, would, evolve, into, the, imperial, library, and, as, it, is, named, today, the, sterreichische, nationalbibliothek, or, the, austrian, national, library, an, organized, library, that, had, been, expanded, through, purchases, maximilian, s, collection, was, dispersed, between, innsbruck, vienna, and, wiener, neustadt, the, wiener, neustadt, part, was, under, conrad, celtis, s, management, the, more, valuable, part, was, in, innsbruck, already, in, maximilian, s, time, the, idea, and, function, of, libraries, were, changing, and, it, became, important, that, scholars, gained, access, to, the, books, under, maximilian, who, was, casual, in, his, attitude, to, scholars, which, marvelled, the, french, chronicler, pierre, frossart, it, was, fairly, easy, for, a, scholar, to, gain, access, to, the, emperor, the, court, and, thus, the, library, but, despite, the, intention, of, rulers, like, maximilian, ii, and, his, chief, imperial, librarian, blotius, and, charles, vi, to, make, the, library, open, to, the, general, public, the, process, was, only, completed, in, 1860, during, maximilian, s, time, there, were, several, projects, of, an, encyclopaedic, nature, among, them, the, incomplete, projects, of, conrad, celtis, however, as, the, founder, of, the, collegium, poetarum, et, mathematicorum, and, a, program, thinker, programmdenker, term, used, by, jan, dirk, m, ller, and, hans, joachim, ziegeler, celtis, established, an, encyclopaedic, scientific, model, that, increasingly, integrated, and, favoured, mechanical, arts, in, relation, to, the, combination, between, natural, sciences, and, technology, and, associated, them, with, divina, fabrica, god, s, creation, in, the, six, days, in, consistence, with, celtis, s, design, the, university, s, curriculum, and, the, political, and, scientific, order, of, maximilian, s, time, which, was, also, influenced, by, developments, in, the, previous, eras, the, humanist, gregor, reisch, who, was, also, maximilian, s, confessor, produced, the, margarita, philosophica, the, first, modern, encyclopaedia, of, any, importance, first, published, in, 1503, the, work, covers, rhetoric, grammar, logic, music, mathematical, topics, childbirth, astronomy, astrology, chemical, topics, including, alchemy, and, hell, an, area, that, saw, many, new, developments, under, maximilian, was, cartography, of, which, the, important, center, in, germany, was, nuremberg, in, 1515, d, rer, and, johannes, stabius, created, the, first, world, map, projected, on, a, solid, geometric, sphere, bert, de, munck, and, antonella, romano, make, a, connection, between, the, mapmaking, activities, of, d, rer, and, stabius, with, efforts, to, grasp, manipulate, and, represent, time, and, space, which, was, also, associated, with, maximilian, s, unprecedented, dynastic, mythmaking, and, pioneering, printed, works, like, the, triumphal, arch, and, the, triumphal, procession, maximilian, assigned, johannes, cuspinianus, and, stabius, to, compile, a, topography, of, austrian, lands, and, a, set, of, regional, maps, stabius, and, his, friend, georg, tannstetter, worked, together, on, the, maps, the, work, appeared, in, 1533, but, without, maps, the, 1528, lazarus, tannstetter, map, of, tabulae, hungariae, one, of, the, first, regional, maps, in, europe, though, seemed, to, be, related, to, the, project, the, cartographers, martin, waldseem, ller, and, matthias, ringmann, dedicated, their, famous, work, universalis, cosmographia, to, maximilian, although, the, direct, backer, was, rene, ii, of, loraine, the, 1513, edition, of, geography, which, contained, this, map, and, was, also, dedicated, to, maximilian, by, jacobus, aeschler, and, georgius, ubelin, is, considered, by, armando, cortes, to, be, the, climax, of, a, cartography, revolution, the, emperor, himself, dabbled, in, cartography, according, to, buisseret, maximilian, could, call, upon, a, variety, of, cartographic, talent, unrivalled, anywhere, else, in, europe, at, that, time, that, included, celtis, stabius, cuspinianus, jacob, ziegler, johannes, aventinus, and, tannstetter, the, development, in, cartography, was, tied, to, the, emperor, s, special, interest, in, sea, route, exploration, as, an, activity, concerning, his, global, monarchy, concept, and, his, responsibilities, as, duke, consort, to, mary, of, burgundy, grandfather, of, the, future, ruler, of, spain, as, well, as, ally, and, close, relation, to, portuguese, kings, he, sent, men, like, martin, behaim, und, hieronymus, m, nzer, to, the, portuguese, court, to, cooperate, in, their, exploration, efforts, as, well, as, to, act, as, his, own, representatives, another, involved, in, the, network, was, the, flemish, josse, van, huerter, or, joss, de, utra, who, would, become, the, first, settler, of, the, island, of, faial, in, the, portuguese, azores, maximilian, also, played, an, essential, role, in, connecting, the, financial, houses, in, augsburg, and, nuremberg, including, the, companies, of, h, chstetter, fugger, and, welser, etc, to, portuguese, expeditions, in, exchange, for, financial, backing, king, manuel, provided, german, investors, with, generous, privileges, the, humanist, conrad, peutinger, was, an, important, agent, who, acted, as, advisor, to, financiers, translator, of, voyage, records, and, imperial, councillor, harald, kleinschmidt, opines, that, regarding, the, matter, of, world, exploration, as, well, as, the, transformation, of, european, world, picture, in, general, maximilian, was, a, crucial, though, much, underestimated, figure, of, his, time, the, evolution, of, cartography, was, connected, to, development, in, ethnography, and, the, new, humanist, science, of, chorography, promoted, by, celtis, at, the, university, of, vienna, as, maximilian, already, promoted, the, ur, german, after, much, archaeological, and, textual, excavation, as, well, as, embraced, the, early, german, wildness, peutinger, correctly, deduced, that, he, would, support, german, exploration, of, another, primitive, people, as, well, using, the, welser, s, commercial, ventures, as, a, pretext, peutinger, goaded, maximilian, into, backing, his, ethnographical, interests, in, the, indians, and, supporting, the, 1505, 1506, voyage, of, balthasar, springer, around, africa, to, india, besides, this, endeavour, added, to, the, emperor, s, image, as, a, conqueror, and, ruler, also, to, rival, the, claims, of, his, arch, rival, suleiman, the, magnificent, regarding, a, global, empire, based, on, an, instruction, dictated, by, maximilian, in, 1512, regarding, indians, in, the, triumphal, procession, j, rg, k, lderer, executed, a, series, of, now, lost, drawings, which, served, as, the, guideline, for, altdorfer, s, miniatures, in, 1513, 1515, which, in, turn, became, the, model, for, woodcuts, half, of, them, based, on, now, lost, 1516, 1518, drawings, by, burgkmair, showing, the, people, of, calicut, in, 1508, burgkmair, produced, the, people, of, africa, and, india, series, focusing, on, depicting, the, peoples, whom, springer, encountered, along, coastal, africa, and, india, the, series, brought, into, being, a, basic, set, of, analytic, categories, that, ethnography, would, take, as, its, methodological, foundation, as, part, of, his, dealings, with, moscow, the, jagiellons, and, the, slavic, east, in, general, maximilian, surrounded, himself, with, people, from, the, slovenian, territories, and, familiar, with, slavic, languages, such, as, sigismund, von, herberstein, himself, a, prominent, ethnographer, petrus, bonomo, george, slatkonia, and, paulus, oberstain, political, necessities, overcame, the, prejudice, against, living, languages, which, started, to, find, a, place, along, latin, throughout, central, europe, also, in, scholarly, areas, the, emperor, s, program, of, restoring, the, university, of, vienna, to, its, former, pre, eminence, was, also, concerned, with, astrology, and, astronomy, he, realized, the, potential, of, the, print, press, when, combined, with, these, branches, of, learning, and, employed, georg, tannstetter, who, in, 1509, was, appointed, by, maximilian, as, the, professor, of, astronomy, at, the, university, of, vienna, and, also, worked, for, a, joint, calendar, reform, attempt, with, the, pope, to, produce, yearly, practica, and, wall, calendars, in, 1515, stabius, who, also, acted, as, the, court, astronomer, d, rer, and, the, astronomer, konrad, heinfogel, produced, the, first, planispheres, of, both, southern, and, northern, hemispheres, also, the, first, printed, celestial, maps, these, maps, prompted, the, revival, of, interest, in, the, field, of, uranometry, throughout, europe, the, ensisheim, meteorite, fell, on, earth, during, the, reign, of, maximilian, 7, november, 1492, this, was, one, of, the, oldest, meteorite, impacts, in, recorded, history, king, maximilian, who, was, on, his, way, to, a, campaign, against, france, ordered, for, it, to, be, dug, up, and, preserved, at, a, local, church, the, meteorite, as, a, good, omen, was, utilized, for, propaganda, against, france, through, the, use, of, broadsheets, with, dramatic, pictures, under, the, direction, of, the, poet, sebastian, brandt, as, maximilian, defeated, a, far, larger, french, army, to, his, own, in, senlis, two, months, later, the, news, would, spread, even, more, on, the, subject, of, calendars, and, calendar, reform, already, in, 1484, the, famous, flemish, scientist, paul, of, middelburg, dedicated, his, praenostica, ad, viginti, annos, duratura, to, maximilian, his, 1513, magnum, opus, paulina, de, recta, paschae, celebratione, was, also, dedicated, to, maximilian, together, with, leo, x, in, addition, to, maps, other, astrological, geometrical, and, horological, instruments, were, also, developed, chiefly, by, stiborius, and, stabius, who, understood, the, need, to, cooperate, with, the, emperors, to, make, these, instruments, into, useful, tools, for, propaganda, also, the, extraordinarily, luxurious, planetarium, that, took, twelve, men, to, carry, and, was, given, as, a, diplomatic, gift, by, ferdinand, i, to, suleiman, the, magnificent, in, 1541, originally, belonged, to, maximilian, he, loved, to, introduce, newly, invented, musical,

the, reichstag, he, staged, a, show, of, firework, this, was, the, first, recorded, german, firework, inspired, by, the, example, of, italian, princes, completed, with, firework, music, provided, by, singers, and, court, trumpeters, machiavelli, judged, him, as, extravagant, but, these, were, not, fireworks, done, for, pleasure, peaceful, celebration, or, religious, purpose, as, the, type, often, seen, in, italy, but, a, core, ritual, of, maximilian, s, court, that, demonstrated, the, link, between, pyrotechnics, and, military, technology, the, show, caused, a, stir, the, news, about, the, event, was, distributed, through, a, briefzeitung, or, letter, newspaper, leading, to, fireworks, becoming, fashionable, in, the, baroque, era, it, would, be, a, common, form, of, self, stylization, for, monarchs, a, lot, of, these, scientific, and, artistic, instruments, and, technical, marvels, came, from, nuremberg, by, then, the, great, mechanical, metalworking, and, precision, industry, centre, of, german, renaissance, from, 1510, stabius, also, took, up, permanent, residence, there, after, travelling, with, the, emperor, for, years, the, city, s, precision, industry, and, its, secondary, manufacturing, industries, were, connected, to, the, mining, industry, that, the, leading, financiers, from, the, neighbouring, augsburg, which, had, a, flourishing, printing, industry, and, was, also, important, for, the, emperor, politically, heavily, invested, into, in, partnership, with, princes, like, maximilian, the, development, in, astronomy, astrology, cosmography, and, cartography, as, well, as, a, developing, economy, with, demand, for, training, in, book, keeping, were, tied, with, the, change, in, status, and, professionalization, of, mathematical, studies, that, once, stood, behind, medicine, jurisprudence, and, theology, as, the, lowest, art, in, the, universities, the, leading, figure, was, george, tanstetter, also, the, emperor, s, astrologer, and, physician, who, provided, his, students, with, reasonably, priced, books, through, the, collection, and, publication, of, works, done, by, joannes, de, muris, peuerbach, and, regiomontanus, and, others, as, well, as, wrote, viri, mathematici, lives, of, mathematicians, the, first, historical, study, of, mathematics, of, austria, and, also, a, work, to, consolidate, the, position, of, astronomers, astrologers, in, maximilian, s, court, in, imitation, of, maximilian, s, genealogical, projects, that, reinforced, his, imperial, titles, the, foremost, exponent, and, one, of, the, founders, of, descriptive, geometry, was, albrecht, d, rer, himself, whose, work, melencolia, i, was, a, prime, representation, and, inspired, a, lot, of, discussions, including, its, relation, or, non, relation, to, maximilian, s, status, as, the, most, known, melancholic, of, the, time, his, and, his, humanists, fear, of, the, influence, of, the, planet, saturn, some, say, that, the, engraving, was, a, self, portrayal, of, d, rer, while, others, think, that, it, was, a, talisman, for, maximilian, to, counter, saturn, the, triumphal, arch, hieroglyphics, and, other, esoteric, developments, in, his, court, respectively, etc, maximilian, continued, with, the, strong, tradition, of, supporting, physicians, at, court, started, by, his, father, frederick, iii, despite, maximilian, himself, had, little, personal, use, for, them, he, usually, consulted, everyone, s, opinions, and, then, opted, for, some, self, curing, folk, practices, he, kept, on, his, payroll, about, 23, court, physicians, whom, he, poached, during, his, long, travels, from, the, courts, of, his, relatives, friends, rivals, and, urban, hosts, an, innovative, solution, was, entrusting, these, physicians, with, healthcare, in, the, most, important, cities, for, which, purpose, an, allowance, and, horses, were, made, available, to, them, alessandro, benedetti, dedicated, his, historia, corporis, humani, sive, anatomice, the, account, of, human, body, or, anatomy, to, the, emperor, as, humanism, was, established, the, medical, faculty, of, the, university, of, vienna, increasingly, abandoned, scholasticism, and, focused, on, studying, laws, of, disease, and, anatomy, based, on, actual, experiences, the, early, fifteenth, century, the, medical, faculty, of, the, university, tried, to, gain, influence, upon, the, apothecaries, of, the, city, in, order, to, enhance, the, dispensed, medicines, quality, and, to, enforce, uniform, preparation, modes, finally, in, 1517, maximilian, granted, them, a, privilege, which, allowed, the, faculty, to, inspect, the, viennese, pharmacies, and, to, check, the, identity, quality, and, proper, storage, of, the, ingredients, as, well, as, the, formulated, preparations, likely, a, victim, of, syphilis, dubbed, the, french, disease, and, used, by, maximilian, and, his, humanists, like, joseph, gr, npeck, in, their, propaganda, and, artistic, works, against, france, himself, maximilian, had, an, interest, in, the, disease, which, led, him, to, establish, eight, hospitals, in, various, hereditary, lands, he, also, retained, an, interest, in, the, healing, properties, of, berries, and, herbs, all, his, life, and, invented, a, recipe, for, an, invigorating, stone, beer, in, glarus, switzerland, he, is, still, commemorated, for, his, receipt, against, plague, maximilian, had, an, interest, in, archaeology, creative, and, participatory, rather, than, objective, and, distancing, and, sometimes, destructive, according, to, christopher, s, wood, his, chief, advisor, on, archaeological, matters, was, konrad, peutinger, who, was, also, the, founder, of, classical, germanic, and, roman, studies, peutinger, commenced, an, ambitious, project, the, vitae, imperatorum, augustorum, a, series, of, biographies, of, emperors, from, augustus, to, maximilian, each, biography, would, also, include, epigraphic, and, numismatic, evidences, but, only, the, early, sections, were, completed, the, search, for, medals, ultimately, led, to, a, broad, craze, in, germany, for, medals, as, an, alternative, for, portraiture, at, the, suggestion, of, the, emperor, the, scholar, published, his, collection, of, roman, inscriptions, maximilian, did, not, distinguish, between, the, secular, and, the, sacred, the, middle, ages, and, antiquity, and, considered, equal, in, archaeological, value, the, various, searches, and, excavations, of, the, holy, tunic, rediscovered, in, trier, in, 1513, after, maximilian, demanded, to, see, it, and, then, exhibited, reportedly, attracting, 100, 000, pilgrims, roman, and, german, reliefs, and, inscriptions, etc, and, the, most, famous, quest, of, all, the, search, for, the, remains, of, hero, siegfried, maximilian, s, private, collection, activities, were, carried, out, by, his, secretary, the, humanist, johann, fuchsmagen, on, his, behalf, sometimes, the, emperor, came, in, contact, with, antiquities, during, his, campaigns, for, example, an, old, german, inscription, found, in, kufstein, in, 1504, that, he, immediately, sent, to, peutinger, around, 1512, 1514, pirckheimer, translated, and, presented, maximilian, with, horapollo, s, hieroglyphica, the, hieroglyphics, would, be, incorporated, by, d, rer, into, the, triumphal, arch, which, rudolf, wittkower, considers, the, greatest, hieroglyphic, monument, maximilian, s, time, was, an, era, of, international, development, for, cryptography, his, premier, expert, on, cryptography, was, the, abbot, trithemius, who, dedicated, polygraphiae, libri, sex, controversially, disguised, as, a, treatise, on, occult, either, because, its, real, target, audience, was, the, selected, few, such, as, maximilian, or, to, attract, public, attention, to, a, tedious, field, to, the, emperor, and, wrote, another, work, on, steganography, steganographia, posthumously, published, as, practitioner, maximilian, functioned, as, the, empire, s, first, cipher, expert, himself, it, was, under, his, reign, that, proven, use, of, encrypted, messages, in, the, german, chancellery, was, first, recorded, although, it, was, not, as, elaborate, as, the, mature, italian, and, spanish, systems, maximilian, experimented, with, different, encryption, methods, even, in, his, private, correspondence, often, based, on, the, upper, italian, models, in, the, fields, of, history, and, historiography, trithemius, was, also, a, notable, forger, and, inventive, historian, who, helped, to, connect, maximilian, to, trojan, heroes, the, merovingians, and, the, carolingians, the, project, had, contributions, from, maximilian, s, other, court, historiographers, and, genealogists, such, as, ladislaus, suntheim, johann, stabius, johannes, cuspinian, and, jakob, mennel, while, his, colleagues, like, jakob, mennel, and, ladislaus, suntheim, often, inserted, invented, ancient, ancestors, for, the, missing, links, trithemius, invented, entire, sources, such, as, hunibald, supposedly, a, scythian, historian, meginfrid, and, wastald, the, historiographer, josef, gr, npeck, wrote, the, work, historia, friderici, iii, et, maximiliani, i, which, would, be, dedicated, to, charles, v, the, first, history, of, germany, based, on, original, sources, patronized, by, maximilian, and, cultivated, by, peutinger, aventin, pirchkheimer, stabius, cuspianian, and, celtis, was, the, epitome, rerum, germanicarum, written, by, jakob, wimpheling, in, which, it, was, argued, that, the, germans, possessed, their, own, flourishing, culture, maximilian, s, time, was, the, age, of, great, world, chronicles, the, most, famous, and, influential, is, the, nuremberg, chronicle, of, which, the, author, hartmann, schedel, is, usually, considered, one, of, the, important, panegyrists, and, propagandists, hired, and, independent, of, the, emperor, and, his, anti, ottoman, propaganda, agenda, according, to, maria, golubeva, maximilian, and, his, court, preferred, the, fictional, settings, and, reimagination, of, history, such, as, the, weisskunig, a, unique, mixture, of, history, and, heroic, romance, so, no, outstanding, works, of, historiography, such, as, those, of, molinet, and, chastelain, at, the, burgundian, court, were, produced, the, authors, of, the, oxford, history, of, historical, writing, volume, 3, 1400, 1800, point, out, three, major, distinctives, in, the, historical, literature, within, the, imperial, circle, the, first, was, genealogical, research, which, maximilian, elevated, to, new, heights, and, represented, most, prominently, by, the, f, rstliche, chronik, written, by, jakob, mennel, the, second, encompassed, projects, associated, with, the, printing, revolution, such, as, maximilian, s, autobiographical, projects, and, d, rer, s, triumphal, arch, the, third, and, also, the, most, sober, strain, of, historical, scholarship, constituted, a, serious, engagement, with, imperial, legacy, with, the, scholar, johannes, cuspinianus, being, its, most, notable, representative, seton, watson, remarks, that, all, his, important, works, show, the, connection, to, maximilian, with, the, commentarii, de, romanorum, consulibus, being, the, most, profound, and, critical, the, de, caesaribus, et, imperatoribus, romanorum, also, considered, by, cesc, esteve, as, his, greatest, work, possessing, the, most, practical, interest, especially, regarding, maximilian, s, life, and, the, austria, giving, a, complete, history, of, the, nation, up, to, 1519, he, had, notable, influence, on, the, development, of, the, musical, tradition, in, austria, and, germany, as, well, several, historians, credit, maximilian, with, playing, the, decisive, role, in, making, vienna, the, music, capital, of, europe, under, his, reign, the, habsburg, musical, culture, reached, its, first, high, point, and, he, had, at, his, service, the, best, musicians, in, europe, he, began, the, habsburg, tradition, of, supporting, large, scale, choirs, which, he, staffed, with, the, brilliant, musicians, of, his, days, like, paul, hofhaimer, heinrich, isaac, and, ludwig, senfl, his, children, inherited, the, parents, passion, for, music, and, even, in, their, father, s, lifetime, supported, excellent, chapels, in, brussels, and, mechelen, with, masters, such, as, alexander, agricola, marbriano, de, orto, who, worked, for, philip, pierre, de, la, rue, and, josquin, desprez, who, worked, for, margaret, after, witnessing, the, brilliant, burgundian, court, culture, he, looked, to, the, burgundian, court, chapel, to, create, his, own, imperial, chapel, as, he, was, always, on, the, move, he, brought, the, chapel, as, well, as, his, whole, peripatetic, court, with, him, in, 1498, though, he, established, the, imperial, chapel, in, vienna, under, the, direction, of, george, slatkonia, who, would, later, become, the, bishop, of, vienna, music, benefitted, greatly, through, the, cross, fertilization, between, several, centres, in, burgundy, italy, austria, and, tyrol, where, maximilian, inherited, the, chapel, of, his, uncle, sigismund, in, the, service, of, maximilian, isaac, the, first, continental, composer, who, provided, music, on, demand, for, the, monarch, employer, cultivated, the, mass, proper, genre, with, an, intensity, unrivalled, anywhere, else, in, europe, he, created, a, huge, cycle, of, polyphonic, mass, propers, most, of, which, was, published, posthumously, in, the, collection, choralis, constantinus, printed, between, 1550, and, 1555, david, j, rothenberg, comments, that, like, many, of, the, other, artistic, projects, commissioned, and, instilled, with, maximilian, s, bold, artistic, vision, and, imperial, ideology, it, was, never, completed, a, notable, artistic, monument, seemingly, of, great, symbolic, value, to, the, emperor, was, isaac, s, motet, virgo, prudentissima, which, affiliated, the, reigns, of, two, sovereign, monarches, the, virgin, mary, of, heaven, and, maximilian, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, motet, describes, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, in, which, mary, described, as, the, most, prudent, virgin, allusion, to, parable, of, the, ten, virgins, beautiful, as, the, moon, excellent, as, the, sun, and, glowing, brightly, as, the, dawn, was, crowned, as, queen, of, heaven, and, united, with, christ, her, bridegroom, and, son, at, the, highest, place, in, heaven, rothenberg, opines, that, d, rer, s, festival, of, the, rose, garlands, see, below, was, its, direct, visual, counterpart, the, idea, was, also, reflected, in, the, scene, of, the, assumption, seen, in, the, berlin, book, of, hours, of, mary, of, burgundy, and, maximilian, commissioned, when, mary, of, burgundy, was, still, alive, with, some, images, added, posthumously, among, some, authors, maximilian, has, a, reputation, as, the, media, emperor, the, historian, larry, silver, describes, him, as, the, first, ruler, who, realized, and, exploited, the, propaganda, potential, of, the, print, press, both, for, images, and, texts, the, reproduction, of, the, triumphal, arch, mentioned, above, in, printed, form, is, an, example, of, art, in, service, of, propaganda, made, available, for, the, public, by, the, economical, method, of, printing, maximilian, did, not, have, money, to, actually, construct, it, at, least, 700, copies, were, created, in, the, first, edition, and, hung, in, ducal, palaces, and, town, halls, through, the, reich, historian, joachim, whaley, comments, that, by, comparison, with, the, extraordinary, range, of, activities, documented, by, silver, and, the, persistence, and, intensity, with, which, they, were, pursued, even, louis, xiv, appears, a, rather, relaxed, amateur, whaley, notes, though, that, maximilian, had, an, immediate, stimulus, for, his, campaign, of, self, aggrandizement, through, public, relation, the, series, of, conflicts, that, involved, maximilian, forced, him, to, seek, means, to, secure, his, position, whaley, further, suggests, that, despite, the, later, religious, divide, patriotic, motifs, developed, during, maximilian, s, reign, both, by, maximilian, himself, and, by, the, humanist, writers, who, responded, to, him, formed, the, core, of, a, national, political, culture, historian, manfred, hollegger, notes, though, that, the, emperor, s, contemporaries, certainly, did, not, see, maximilian, as, a, media, emperor, he, achieved, little, political, impact, with, pamphlets, leaflets, and, printed, speeches, nevertheless, it, is, certainly, true, that, he, combined, brilliantly, all, the, media, available, at, that, time, for, his, major, literary, and, artistic, projects, tupu, yl, anttila, notes, that, while, his, daughter, to, whom, maximilian, entrusted, a, lot, of, his, diplomacy, often, maintained, a, sober, tone, and, kept, a, competent, staff, of, advisors, who, helped, her, with, her, letters, her, father, did, not, demonstrate, such, an, effort, and, occasionally, sent, emotional, and, erratic, letters, the, letters, of, maximilian, and, margaret, were, often, presented, to, foreign, diplomats, to, prove, their, trust, in, each, other, maria, golubeva, opines, that, with, maximilian, one, should, use, the, term, propaganda, in, the, sense, suggested, by, karl, vocelka, opinion, making, also, according, to, golubeva, unlike, the, narrative, usually, presented, by, austrian, historians, including, wiesflecker, maximilian, s, propaganda, that, was, associated, with, militarism, universal, imperial, claims, and, court, historiography, with, a, tendency, towards, world, domination, was, not, the, simple, result, of, his, burgundian, experience, his, model, of, political, competition, as, shown, in, his, semi, autobiographical, works, while, equally, secular, ignored, the, negotiable, and, institutional, aspects, inherent, in, the, burgundian, model, and, at, the, same, time, emphasized, top, down, decision, making, and, military, force, during, maximilian, s, reign, with, encouragement, from, the, emperor, and, his, humanists, iconic, spiritual, figures, were, reintroduced, or, became, notable, the, humanists, rediscovered, the, work, germania, written, by, tacitus, according, to, peter, h, wilson, the, female, figure, of, germania, was, reinvented, by, the, emperor, as, the, virtuous, pacific, mother, of, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, inheriting, the, work, of, klosterneuburg, canons, and, his, father, frederick, iii, he, promoted, leopold, iii, margrave, of, austria, who, had, family, ties, to, the, emperor, who, was, canonized, in, 1485, and, became, the, patron, of, austria, in, 1506, to, maximize, the, effect, that, consolidated, his, rule, the, emperor, delayed, the, translation, of, leopold, s, bones, for, years, until, he, could, personally, be, there, he, promoted, the, association, between, his, own, wife, mary, of, burgundy, and, the, virgin, mary, that, had, already, been, started, in, her, lifetime, by, members, of, the, burgundian, court, before, his, arrival, these, activities, included, the, patronage, by, maximilian, philip, the, fair, and, charles, v, of, the, devotion, of, the, seven, sorrows, as, well, as, the, commission, by, maximilian, and, his, close, associates, of, various, artworks, dedicating, to, the, topic, such, as, the, famous, paintings, feast, of, the, rosary, 1506, and, death, of, the, virgin, 1518, one, year, before, the, emperor, s, death, by, albrecht, d, rer, the, famous, diptych, of, maximilian, s, extended, family, after, 1515, by, strigel, the, manuscript, vats, 160, by, the, composer, pierre, alamire, maximilian, s, reign, witnessed, the, gradual, emergence, of, the, german, common, language, his, chancery, played, a, notable, role, in, developing, new, linguistic, standards, martin, luther, credited, maximilian, and, the, wettin, elector, frederick, the, wise, with, the, unification, of, german, language, tennant, and, johnson, opine, that, while, other, chanceries, have, been, considered, significant, and, then, receded, in, important, when, the, research, direction, changes, the, chanceries, of, these, two, rulers, have, always, been, considered, important, from, the, beginning, as, a, part, of, his, influential, literary, and, propaganda, projects, maximilian, had, his, autobiographical, works, embellished, reworked, and, sometimes, ghostwritten, in, the, chancery, itself, he, is, also, credited, with, a, major, reform, of, the, imperial, chancery, office, maximilian, is, said, to, have, caused, a, standardization, and, streamlining, in, the, language, of, his, chancery, which, set, the, pace, for, chanceries, and, printers, throughout, the, empire, the, form, of, written, german, language, he, introduced, into, his, chancery, was, called, maximilian, s, chancery, speech, maximilianische, kanzleisprache, and, considered, a, form, of, early, new, high, german, it, replaced, older, forms, of, written, language, that, were, close, to, middle, high, german, this, new, form, was, used, by, the, imperial, chanceries, until, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, and, therefore, also, referred, to, as, the, imperial, speech, never, having, much, money, maximilian, could, not, afford, large, scale, building, projects, however, he, left, a, few, notable, constructions, among, which, the, most, remarkable, is, the, cenotaph, designed, by, maximilian, he, began, in, the, hofkirche, innsbruck, which, was, completed, long, after, his, death, and, has, been, praised, as, the, most, important, monument, of, renaissance, austria, and, considered, the, culmination, of, burgundian, tomb, tradition, especially, for, the, groups, of, statues, of, family, members, that, displayed, late, gothic, features, combined, with, renaissance, traditions, like, reliefs, and, busts, of, roman, emperors, the, monument, was, vastly, expanded, under, his, grandson, ferdinand, i, who, added, the, tumba, the, portal, and, on, the, advice, of, his, vice, chancellor, georg, sigmund, seld, commissioned, the, 24, marble, reliefs, based, on, the, images, on, the, triumphal, arch, the, work, was, only, finished, under, archduke, ferdinand, ii, the, reliefs, were, carved, by, the, flemish, sculptor, alexander, colyn, while, the, statues, were, cast, by, the, bronze, founder, stefan, godl, following, the, designs, of, gilg, sesshelschreiber, and, j, rg, k, lderer, the, bronze, busts, of, roman, emperors, were, created, by, j, rg, muskat, after, taking, tyrol, in, order, to, symbolize, his, new, wealth, and, power, he, built, the, golden, roof, the, roof, for, a, balcony, overlooking, the, town, center, of, innsbruck, from, which, to, watch, the, festivities, celebrating, his, assumption, of, rule, over, tyrol, the, roof, is, made, with, gold, plated, copper, tiles, the, structure, was, a, symbol, of, the, presence, of, the, ruler, even, when, he, was, physically, absent, it, began, the, vogue, of, using, reliefs, to, decorate, oriel, windows, the, golden, roof, is, also, considered, one, of, the, most, notable, habsburg, monuments, like, maximilian, s, cenotaph, it, is, in, an, essentially, gothic, idiom, the, structure, was, built, by, niclas, t, ring, nikolaus, turing, while, the, paintings, was, done, by, j, rg, k, lderer, the, innsbruck, hofburg, was, redesigned, and, expanded, chiefly, under, niclas, t, ring, by, the, time, maximilian, died, in, 1519, the, palace, was, one, of, the, most, beautiful, and, renowned, secular, structures, of, the, era, but, would, be, rebuilt, later, in, the, baroque, style, by, maria, theresa, the, famous, sculpture, schutzmantelmadonna, virgin, of, mercy, donated, in, 1510, by, maximilian, to, the, frauenstein, pilgrimage, church, in, molln, was, a, work, by, gregor, erhart, from, 1498, onwards, maximilian, caused, many, castles, and, palaces, in, vienna, graz, wiener, neustadt, innsbruck, and, linz, to, be, renovated, and, modernized, not, only, the, facade, was, redesigned, and, glazed, bricks, were, integrated, maximilian, also, paid, special, attention, to, the, sanitation, aspect, issuing, precise, instructions, concerning, the, secret, chamber, the, deflection, of, waste, into, a, cesspit, through, pipes, and, the, purification, of, smells, through, the, use, of, herbal, essences, in, many, towns, he, caused, streets, and, alleys, to, be, cobbled, and, added, gutters, for, rain, water, he, issued, regulations, that, ordered, open, drains, for, waste, water, to, be, bricked, up, and, forbade, the, keeping, of, animals, in, the, towns, it, was, also, ordained, that, no, rubbish, was, allowed, in, the, streets, overnight, directions, related, to, fire, prevention, were, also, issued, leading, to, fire, walls, being, constructed, between, the, houses, and, tiled, roofs, in, many, towns, in, the, hereditary, lands, and, southern, germany, through, his, financial, blessings, there, were, wooden, cities, that, were, transformed, into, stone, ones, together, with, franz, von, taxis, in, 1490, maximilian, developed, the, first, modern, postal, service, in, the, world, the, system, was, originally, built, to, improve, communication, between, his, scattered, territories, connecting, burgundy, austria, spain, and, france, and, later, developing, to, a, europe, wide, fee, based, system, fixed, postal, routes, the, first, in, europe, were, developed, together, with, regular, and, reliable, service, from, the, beginning, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, system, became, open, to, private, mail, the, initiative, was, immediately, emulated, by, france, and, england, although, rulers, there, restricted, the, spread, of, private, mails, and, private, postal, networks, systematic, improvement, allowed, communication, to, reach, maximilian, wherever, he, was, twice, as, fast, as, normal, to, the, point, wolfgang, behringer, remarks, that, perception, of, temporal, and, spatial, dimensions, was, changed, the, new, development, usually, described, as, the, communication, revolution, could, largely, be, traced, back, to, maximilian, s, initiative, with, contributions, from, frederick, iii, and, charles, the, bold, in, developing, the, messenger, networks, the, italian, courier, model, and, possibly, influence, from, the, french, model, the, establishment, of, the, postal, network, also, signaled, the, beginning, of, a, commercial, market, for, news, together, with, the, emergence, of, commercial, newsagents, and, news, agencies, which, the, emperor, actively, encouraged, according, to, michael, kunczik, he, was, the, first, to, utilize, one, sided, battle, reports, targeting, the, mass, including, the, use, of, the, early, predecessors, of, modern, newspapers, neue, zeitungen, the, capital, resources, he, poured, into, the, postage, system, as, well, as, support, for, the, related, printing, press, when, archduke, he, opened, a, school, for, sophisticated, engraving, techniques, were, on, a, level, unprecedented, by, european, monarches, and, earned, him, stern, rebuke, from, the, father, his, patronage, drew, to, augsburg, printmakers, from, the, netherlands, especially, from, antwerp, like, jost, de, negker, and, the, brothers, cornelis, i, died, 1528, and, willem, liefrinck, who, came, there, as, teens, after, his, death, as, teams, dispersed, negker, remained, in, augsburg, while, the, liefrincks, returned, to, their, homeland, established, there, a, printmaking, dynasty, and, introduced, german, styled, workshops, according, to, printing, colour, 1400, 1700, history, techniques, functions, and, receptions, there, was, a, dramatic, drop, in, both, quantity, and, quality, of, print, projects, in, augsburg, as, a, whole, once, charles, v, took, over, the, development, of, the, printing, press, led, to, a, search, for, a, national, font, in, 1508, or, 1510, maximilian, possibly, with, d, rer, s, advice, commissioned, the, calligrapher, leonhard, wagner, to, create, a, new, font, wagner, dedicated, his, calligraphy, work, proba, centum, scripturatum, including, one, hundred, fonts, to, maximilian, who, chose, the, schwabacher, based, font, fraktur, deemed, the, most, beautiful, one, while, he, originally, envisioned, this, font, for, latin, works, it, became, the, predominant, font, for, german, writings, while, german, printers, would, use, antiqua, for, works, written, in, foreign, languages, the, font, would, spread, to, german, influenced, countries, and, remain, popular, in, germany, until, being, banned, in, 1941, by, the, nazi, government, as, a, jewish, font, burgkmair, was, the, chief, designer, for, most, of, his, printing, projects, augsburg, was, the, great, center, of, the, printing, industry, where, the, emperor, patronized, printing, and, other, types, of, craft, through, the, agency, of, conrad, peutinger, giving, impetus, for, the, formation, of, an, imperial, style, burgkmair, and, erhard, ratdolt, created, new, printing, techniques, as, for, his, own, works, as, he, wanted, to, produce, the, appearance, of, luxury, manuscripts, he, mixed, handcrafted, elements, with, printing, his, book, of, prayers, and, theuerdank, weisskunig, and, freydal, were, unfinished, before, the, emperor, s, death, were, printed, with, a, type, that, resembled, calligraphy, the, imperial, fraktur, created, by, johannes, sch, nperger, for, prestigious, recipients, he, used, parchment, rather, than, paper, at, least, one, copy, of, the, book, of, hours, was, decorated, by, hand, by, burgkmair, d, rer, hans, baldung, j, rg, breu, and, cranach, maximilian, had, appointed, his, daughter, margaret, as, the, regent, of, the, netherlands, and, she, fulfilled, this, task, well, tupu, yl, anttila, opines, that, margaret, acted, as, de, facto, queen, consort, in, a, political, sense, first, to, her, father, and, then, charles, v, absent, rulers, who, needed, a, representative, dynastic, presence, that, also, complemented, their, characteristics, her, queenly, virtues, helped, her, to, play, the, role, of, diplomat, and, peace, maker, as, well, as, guardian, and, educator, of, future, rulers, whom, maximilian, called, our, children, or, our, common, children, in, letters, to, margaret, this, was, a, model, that, developed, as, part, of, the, solution, for, the, emerging, habsburg, composite, monarchy, and, would, continue, to, serve, later, generations, through, wars, and, marriages, he, extended, the, habsburg, influence, in, every, direction, to, the, netherlands, spain, bohemia, hungary, poland, and, italy, this, influence, lasted, for, centuries, and, shaped, much, of, european, history, the, habsburg, empire, survived, as, the, austro, hungarian, empire, until, it, was, dissolved, 3, november, 1918, 399, years, 11, months, and, 9, days, after, the, passing, of, maximilian, geoffrey, parker, summarizes, maximilian, s, political, legacy, as, follows, by, the, time, charles, received, his, presentation, copy, of, der, weisskunig, in, 1517, maximilian, could, point, to, four, major, successes, he, had, protected, and, reorganized, the, burgundian, netherlands, whose, political, future, had, seemed, bleak, when, he, became, their, ruler, forty, years, earlier, likewise, he, had, overcome, the, obstacles, posed, by, individual, institutions, traditions, and, languages, to, forge, the, sub, alpine, lands, he, inherited, from, his, father, into, a, single, state, austria, ruled, and, taxed, by, a, single, administration, that, he, created, at, innsbruck, he, had, also, reformed, the, chaotic, central, government, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, ways, that, though, imperfect, would, last, almost, until, its, demise, three, centuries, later, finally, by, arranging, strategic, marriages, for, his, grandchildren, he, had, established, the, house, of, habsburg, as, the, premier, dynasty, in, central, and, eastern, europe, creating, a, polity, that, his, successors, would, expand, over, the, next, four, centuries, the, britannica, encyclopaedia, comments, on, maximilian, s, achievements, maximilian, i, made, his, family, the, habsburgs, dominant, in, 16th, century, europe, he, added, vast, lands, to, the, traditional, austrian, holdings, securing, the, netherlands, by, his, own, marriage, hungary, and, bohemia, by, treaty, and, military, pressure, and, spain, and, the, spanish, empire, by, the, marriage, of, his, son, philip, great, as, maximilian, s, achievements, were, they, did, not, match, his, ambitions, he, had, hoped, to, unite, all, of, western, europe, by, reviving, the, empire, of, charlemagne, his, military, talents, were, considerable, and, led, him, to, use, war, to, attain, his, ends, he, carried, out, meaningful, administrative, reforms, and, his, military, innovations, would, transform, europe, s, battlefields, for, more, than, a, century, but, he, was, ignorant, of, economics, and, was, financially, unreliable, hollegger, notes, that, as, maximilian, could, not, persuade, his, imperial, estates, to, support, his, plans, he, cultivated, a, system, of, alliances, in, which, the, germ, of, modern, european, powers, could, be, seen, like, in, the, game, of, chess, no, piece, could, be, moved, without, thinking, ahead, about, the, others, according, to, cauchies, it, was, after, the, fifteen, struggling, years, of, mary, and, maximilian, s, joint, rule, and, then, of, maximilian, s, sole, rule, the, state, building, project, first, envisioned, by, the, burgundian, dukes, showed, concrete, results, a, consortium, of, territories, nevertheless, emerged, which, found, its, place, in, the, west, under, the, heirs, philip, the, handsome, and, charles, v, nevertheless, even, though, an, innovative, leader, of, stature, maximilian, s, zealous, anti, french, sentiments, to, which, even, the, senlis, treaty, was, a, failure, his, project, of, imperial, universality, and, his, habsburg, heritage, tended, to, make, him, out, of, touch, with, the, burgundian, perspective, as, displayed, by, his, son, philip, a, peace, loving, monarch, and, his, court, although, in, his, mind, maximilian, probably, imagined, himself, as, the, true, defender, of, the, low, countries, that, inexplicably, always, rejected, him, so, much, haemers, notes, that, for, the, dutch, it, is, impossible, to, celebrate, him, the, way, germans, or, austrians, do, even, if, that, is, about, the, troubled, feelings, maximilian, left, and, national, pride, rather, than, true, reflection, of, the, past, hugh, trevor, roper, opines, that, although, maximilian, s, politics, and, wars, accomplished, little, by, harnessing, the, arts, he, surrounded, his, dynasty, with, a, lustrous, aura, it, had, previously, lacked, it, was, to, this, illusion, that, his, successors, looked, for, their, inspiration, to, them, he, was, not, simply, the, second, founder, of, the, dynasty, he, was, the, creator, of, its, legend, one, that, transcended, politics, nationality, even, religion, paula, sutter, fichtner, opines, that, maximilian, was, the, author, of, a, basic, but, imperfect, script, for, the, organization, of, a, habsburg, government, now, charged, with, administering, a, territorial, complex, that, extended, far, beyond, the, dynasty, s, medieval, patrimony, in, central, europe, he, used, his, revenues, profligately, for, wars, although, aware, of, the, dangers, of, over, extended, credit, in, order, to, protect, his, borders, imperial, prerogatives, and, advance, habsburg, interests, all, of, which, he, considered, seriously, he, could, not, internalize, fiscal, discipline, the, role, of, the, emperor, in, the, government, was, very, personalized, only, when, maximilian, s, health, failed, him, badly, in, 1518, did, he, set, up, a, hofrat, including, 18, jurists, and, nobles, from, the, empire, and, austrian, lands, to, assist, him, with, the, responsibilities, he, was, incapable, of, handling, anymore, the, alliance, between, crown, and, cities, for, which, he, laid, the, foundation, never, culminated, in, a, southern, centralized, habsburg, monarchy, the, rise, of, the, common, man, in, the, crucial, years, of, mid, 1250s, forced, imperial, cities, in, upper, germany, to, master, the, reformation, in, a, way, that, estranged, them, from, the, emperor, a, situation, which, charles, v, and, ferdinand, were, too, busy, with, non, german, affairs, to, manage, maximilian, s, life, is, still, commemorated, in, central, europe, centuries, later, the, order, of, st, george, which, he, sponsored, still, exists, in, 2011, for, example, a, monument, was, erected, for, him, in, cortina, d, ampezzo, also, in, 1981, in, cormons, on, the, piazza, della, libert, a, statue, of, maximilian, which, was, there, until, the, first, world, war, was, put, up, again, on, the, occasion, of, the, 500th, anniversary, of, his, death, there, were, numerous, commemorative, events, in, 2019, at, which, karl, von, habsburg, the, current, head, of, the, house, of, habsburg, represented, the, imperial, dynasty, a, barracks, in, wiener, neustadt, maximilian, kaserne, formerly, artilleriekaserne, a, military, base, for, the, jagdkommando, of, the, austrian, armed, forces, was, named, after, maximilian, amsterdam, still, retains,

him, financially, in, his, military, expeditions, he, granted, its, citizens, the, right, to, use, the, image, of, his, crown, which, remains, a, symbol, of, the, city, as, part, of, its, coat, of, arms, the, practice, survived, the, later, revolt, against, habsburg, spain, the, central, canal, in, amsterdam, was, named, in, 1615, as, the, keizersgracht, emperor, s, canal, after, maximilian, the, city, beer, brugse, zot, or, the, fools, of, bruges, of, bruges, which, suffered, a, four, century, long, decline, that, was, partially, inflicted, by, maximilian, s, orders, that, required, foreign, merchants, to, transfer, operations, to, antwerp, later, he, would, withdraw, the, orders, but, it, proved, too, late, is, associated, with, the, emperor, who, according, to, legend, told, the, city, in, a, conciliatory, celebration, that, they, did, not, need, to, build, an, asylum, as, the, city, was, full, of, fools, the, swans, of, the, city, are, considered, a, perpetual, remembrance, allegedly, ordered, by, maximilian, for, lanchals, whose, name, meant, long, necks, and, whose, emblem, was, a, swan, the, loyalist, minister, who, got, beheaded, while, maximilian, was, forced, to, watch, in, mechelen, burgundian, capital, under, margaret, of, austria, every, 25, years, an, ommegang, that, commemorates, maximilian, s, arrival, as, well, as, other, major, events, is,

exalted, order, as, its, head, he, did, everything, in, his, power, to, restore, its, glory, as, well, as, associate, the, order, with, the, habsburg, lineage, he, expelled, the, members, who, had, defected, to, france, and, rewarded, those, loyal, to, him, and, also, invited, foreign, rulers, to, join, its, ranks, maximilian, i, was, a, member, of, the, order, of, the, garter, nominated, by, king, henry, vii, of, england, in, 1489, his, garter, stall, plate, survives, in, st, george, s, chapel, windsor, castle, maximilian, was, patron, of, the, order, of, saint, george, founded, by, his,

or, reddish, hair, a, large, hooked, nose, and, a, jutting, jaw, like, his, father, he, always, shaved, his, beard, as, the, jutting, jaw, was, considered, a, noble, feature, although, not, conventionally, handsome, he, was, well, proportioned, and, considered, physically, attractive, with, abiding, youthfulness, and, an, affable, pleasing, manner, a, womanizer, since, his, teenager, days, he, increasingly, sought, distraction, from, the, tragedy, of, the, first, marriage, and, the, frustration, of, the, second, marriage, in, the, company, of, sleeping, women, in, all, corners, of, his, empire, sigrid, maria, gr, ssing, describes, him, as, a, charming, heartbreaker, for, all, his, life, he, could, manoeuvre, with, one, hand, a, seven, meter, lance, comfortably, maximilian, was, a, late, developer, according, to, his, teacher, johannes, cuspinian, he, did, not, speak, until, he, was, nine, years, old, and, after, that, only, developed, slowly, frederick, iii, recalled, that, when, his, son, was, twelve, he, still, thought, that, the, boy, was, either, mute, or, stupid, in, his, adulthood, he, spoke, six, languages, he, learned, french, from, his, wife, mary, and, was, a, genuinely, talented, author, other, than, languages, mathematics, and, religion, he, painted, and, played, various, instruments, and, was, also, trained, in, farming, carpentry, and, blacksmithing, although, the, focus, of, his, education, was, naturally, kingship, according, to, fichtner, he, did, not, learn, much, from, formal, training, though, because, even, as, a, boy, he, never, sat, still, and, tutors, could, not, do, much, about, that, gerhard, benecke, opines, that, by, nature, he, was, the, man, of, action, a, vigorously, charming, extrovert, who, had, a, conventionally, superficial, interest, in, knowledge, science, and, art, combined, with, excellent, health, in, his, youth, he, remained, virile, into, his, late, thirties, and, although, later, his, health, was, damaged, due, to, a, leg, accident, and, other, ailments, the, emperor, displayed, remarkable, self, discipline, and, hardly, ever, recognized, a, weakness, at, the, 1510, reichstag, in, augsburg, maximilian, 51, fought, against, frederick, of, saxony, 47, in, front, of, a, large, audience, he, was, brave, to, the, point, of, recklessness, and, this, did, not, only, show, in, battles, he, once, entered, a, lion, s, enclosure, in, munich, alone, to, tease, the, lion, and, at, another, point, climbed, to, the, top, of, the, cathedral, of, ulm, stood, on, one, foot, and, turned, himself, round, to, gain, a, full, view, at, the, trepidation, of, his, attendants, in, the, nineteenth, century, an, austrian, officer, lost, his, life, trying, to, repeat, the, emperor, s, feat, while, another, succeeded, while, he, paid, magnificently, for, a, princely, style, he, required, little, for, personal, needs, in, his, mature, years, he, exerted, restraint, on, personal, habits, except, during, his, depressive, phases, when, he, drank, night, and, day, sometimes, incapacitating, the, government, to, the, great, annoyance, of, chancellor, zyprian, von, sernteiner, or, in, the, companion, of, his, artist, friends, the, artists, got, preferential, treatment, in, criminal, matters, too, such, as, the, case, of, veit, stoss, whose, sentence, imprisonment, and, having, his, hands, chopped, off, for, an, actual, crime, issued, by, nuremberg, got, cancelled, on, the, sole, basis, of, genius, the, emperor, s, reasoning, was, that, what, came, as, a, gift, from, god, should, not, be, treated, according, to, usual, norms, or, human, proportions, to, the, astonishment, of, contemporaries, he, laughed, at, the, satire, directed, against, his, person, and, organized, celebrations, after, defeats, historian, ernst, bock, with, whom, benecke, shares, the, same, sentiment, writes, the, following, about, him, his, rosy, optimism, and, utilitarianism, his, totally, naive, amorality, in, matters, political, both, unscrupulous, and, machiavellian, his, sensuous, and, earthy, naturalness, his, exceptional, receptiveness, towards, anything, beautiful, especially, in, the, visual, arts, but, also, towards, the, various, fashions, of, his, time, whether, the, nationalism, in, politics, the, humanism, in, literature, and, philosophy, or, in, matters, of, economics, and, capitalism, further, his, surprising, yearning, for, personal, fame, combined, with, a, striving, for, popularity, above, all, the, clear, consciousness, of, a, developed, individuality, these, properties, maximilian, displayed, again, and, again, historian, paula, fichtner, describes, maximilian, as, a, leader, who, was, ambitious, and, imaginative, to, a, fault, with, self, publicizing, tendencies, as, well, as, territorial, and, administrative, ambitions, that, betrayed, a, nature, both, soaring, and, recognizably, modern, while, dismissing, benecke, s, presentation, of, maximilian, as, an, insensitive, agent, of, exploitation, as, influenced, by, the, author, s, personal, political, leaning, berenger, and, simpson, consider, maximilian, a, greedy, renaissance, prince, and, also, a, prodigious, man, of, action, whose, chief, fault, was, to, have, too, many, irons, in, the, fire, on, the, other, hand, steven, beller, criticizes, him, for, being, too, much, of, a, medieval, knight, who, had, a, hectic, schedule, of, warring, always, crisscrossing, the, whole, continent, to, do, battles, for, example, in, august, 1513, he, commanded, henry, viii, s, english, army, in, the, second, guinegate, and, a, few, weeks, later, joined, the, spanish, forces, in, defeating, the, venetians, with, little, resources, to, support, his, ambitions, according, to, beller, maximilian, should, have, spent, more, time, at, home, persuading, the, estates, to, adopt, a, more, efficient, governmental, and, fiscal, system, thomas, a, brady, jr, praises, the, emperor, s, sense, of, honour, but, criticizes, his, financial, immorality, according, to, geoffrey, parker, both, points, together, with, maximilian, s, martial, qualities, and, hard, working, nature, would, be, inherited, from, the, grandfather, by, charles, v, though, punctilious, to, a, fault, about, his, honor, he, lacked, all, morals, about, money, every, florin, was, spent, mortgaged, and, promised, ten, times, over, before, it, ever, came, in, he, set, his, courtiers, a, model, for, their, infamous, venality, he, sometimes, had, to, leave, his, queen, behind, as, pledge, for, his, debts, and, he, borrowed, continuously, from, his, servitors, large, sums, from, top, officials, tiny, ones, from, servants, and, never, repaid, them, those, who, liked, him, tried, to, make, excuses, certain, english, sources, describe, him, as, a, ruler, who, habitually, failed, to, keep, his, words, according, to, wiesflecker, people, could, often, depend, on, his, promises, more, than, those, of, most, princes, of, his, days, although, he, was, no, stranger, to, the, clausola, francese, and, also, tended, to, use, a, wide, variety, of, statements, to, cover, his, true, intentions, which, unjustly, earned, him, the, reputation, of, being, fickle, hollegger, concurs, that, maximilian, s, court, officials, except, eitelfriedrich, von, zollern, and, wolfgang, von, f, rstenberg, did, expect, gifts, and, money, for, tips, and, help, and, the, emperor, usually, defended, his, counselors, and, servants, even, if, he, acted, against, the, more, blatant, displays, of, material, greed, maximilian, though, was, not, a, man, who, could, be, controlled, or, influenced, easily, by, his, officials, hollegger, also, opines, that, while, many, of, his, political, and, artistic, schemes, leaned, towards, megalomania, there, was, a, sober, realist, who, believed, in, progression, and, relied, on, modern, modes, of, management, underneath, personally, frequently, described, as, humane, gentle, and, friendly, he, reacted, with, anger, violence, and, vengefulness, when, he, felt, his, rights, had, been, injured, or, his, honor, threatened, both, of, which, he, valued, greatly, the, price, for, his, warlike, ruling, style, and, his, ambition, for, a, globalized, monarchy, that, ultimately, achieved, considerable, successes, was, a, continuous, succession, of, war, that, earned, him, the, sobriquet, heart, of, steel, coeur, d, acier, maximilian, was, married, three, times, but, only, the, first, marriage, produced, offspring, the, marriage, produced, three, children, of, whom, only, two, survived, the, drive, behind, this, marriage, to, the, great, annoyance, of, frederick, iii, who, characterized, it, as, disgraceful, was, the, desire, of, personal, revenge, against, the, french, maximilian, blamed, france, for, the, great, tragedies, of, his, life, up, to, and, including, mary, of, burgundy, s, death, political, upheavals, that, followed, troubles, in, the, relationship, with, his, son, and, later, philip, s, death, the, young, king, of, the, romans, had, in, mind, a, pincer, grip, against, the, kingdom, of, france, while, frederick, wanted, him, to, focus, on, expansion, towards, the, east, and, maintenance, of, stability, in, newly, reacquired, austria, but, brittany, was, so, weak, that, it, could, not, resist, french, advance, by, itself, even, briefly, like, the, burgundian, state, had, done, while, maximilian, could, not, even, personally, come, to, brittany, to, consummate, the, marriage, in, addition, he, had, several, illegitimate, children, but, the, number, and, identities, of, those, are, a, matter, of, great, debate, johann, jakob, fugger, writes, in, ehrenspiegel, mirror, of, honour, that, the, emperor, began, fathering, illegitimate, children, after, becoming, a, widower, and, there, were, eight, children, in, total, four, boys, and, four, girls, a, set, of, woodcuts, called, the, triumph, of, emperor,
