with, a, nanny, and, her, husband, a, stonecutter, in, the, town, of, settignano, where, his, father, owned, a, marble, quarry, and, a, small, farm, there, he, gained, his, love, for, marble, as, giorgio, vasari, quotes, him, if, there, is, some, good, in, me, it, is, because, i, was, born, in, the, subtle, atmosphere, of, your, country, of, arezzo, along, with, the, milk, of, my, nurse, i, received, the, knack, of, handling, chisel, and, hammer, with, which, i, make, my, figures, as, a, young, boy, michelangelo, was, sent, to, florence, to, study, grammar, under, the, humanist,

that, time, italy, s, greatest, centre, of, the, arts, and, learning, art, was, sponsored, by, the, signoria, the, town, council, the, merchant, guilds, and, wealthy, patrons, such, as, the, medici, and, their, banking, associates, the, renaissance, a, renewal, of, classical, scholarship, and, the, arts, had, its, first, flowering, in, florence, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, architect, filippo, brunelleschi, having, studied, the, remains, of, classical, buildings, in, rome, had, created, two, churches, san, lorenzo, s, and, santo, spirito, which, embodied, the, classical, precepts, the, sculptor, lorenzo, ghiberti, had, laboured, for, fifty, years, to, create, the, north, and, east, bronze, doors, of, the, baptistry, which, michelangelo, was, to, describe, as, the, gates, of, paradise, the, exterior, niches, of, the, church, of, orsanmichele, contained, a, gallery, of, works, by, the, most, acclaimed, sculptors, of, florence, donatello, ghiberti, andrea, del, verrocchio, and, nanni, di, banco, the, interiors, of, the, older, churches, were, covered, with, frescos, mostly, in, late, medieval, but, also, in, the, early, renaissance, style, begun, by, giotto, and, continued, by, masaccio, in, the, brancacci, chapel, both, of, whose, works, michelangelo, studied, and, copied, in, drawings, during, michelangelo, s, childhood, a, team, of, painters, had, been, called, from, florence, to, the, vatican, to, decorate, the, walls, of, the, sistine, chapel, among, them, was, domenico, ghirlandaio, a, master, in, fresco, painting, perspective, figure, drawing, and, portraiture, who, had, the, largest, workshop, in, florence, in, 1488, at, age, 13, michelangelo, was, apprenticed, to, ghirlandaio, the, next, year, his, father, persuaded, ghirlandaio, to, pay, michelangelo, as, an, artist, which, was, rare, for, someone, of, fourteen, when, in, 1489, lorenzo, de, medici, de, facto, ruler, of, florence, asked, ghirlandaio, for, his, two, best, pupils, ghirlandaio, sent, michelangelo, and, francesco, granacci, from, 1490, to, 1492, michelangelo, attended, the, platonic, academy, a, humanist, academy, founded, by, the, medici, there, his, work, and, outlook, were, influenced, by, many, of, the, most, prominent, philosophers, and, writers, of, the, day, including, marsilio, ficino, pico, della, mirandola, and, poliziano, at, this, time, michelangelo, sculpted, the, reliefs, madonna, of, the, stairs, 1490, 1492, and, battle, of, the, centaurs, 1491, 1492, the, latter, based, on, a, theme, suggested, by, poliziano, and, commissioned, by, lorenzo, de, medici, michelangelo, worked, for, a, time, with, the, sculptor, bertoldo, di, giovanni, when, he, was, seventeen, another, pupil, pietro, torrigiano, struck, him, on, the, nose, causing, the, disfigurement, that, is, conspicuous, in, the, portraits, of, michelangelo, lorenzo, de, medici, s, death, on, 8, april, 1492, brought, a, reversal, of, michelangelo, s, circumstances, michelangelo, left, the, security, of, the, medici, court, and, returned, to, his, father, s, house, in, the, following, months, he, carved, a, polychrome, wooden, crucifix, 1493, as, a, gift, to, the, prior, of, the, florentine, church, of, santo, spirito, which, had, allowed, him, to, do, some, anatomical, studies, of, the, corpses, from, the, church, s, hospital, this, was, the, first, of, several, instances, during, his, career, that, michelangelo, studied, anatomy, by, dissecting, cadavers, between, 1493, and, 1494, he, bought, a, block, of, marble, and, carved, a, larger, than, life, statue, of, hercules, which, was, sent, to, france, and, subsequently, disappeared, sometime, in, the, 18th, century, on, 20, january, 1494, after, heavy, snowfalls, lorenzo, s, heir, piero, de, medici, commissioned, a, statue, made, of, snow, and, michelangelo, again, entered, the, court, of, the, medici, in, the, same, year, the, medici, were, expelled, from, florence, as, the, result, of, the, rise, of, savonarola, michelangelo, left, the, city, before, the, end, of, the, political, upheaval, moving, to, venice, and, then, to, bologna, in, bologna, he, was, commissioned, to, carve, several, of, the, last, small, figures, for, the, completion, of, the, shrine, of, st, dominic, in, the, church, dedicated, to, that, saint, at, this, time, michelangelo, studied, the, robust, reliefs, carved, by, jacopo, della, quercia, around, the, main, portal, of, the, basilica, of, st, petronius, including, the, panel, of, the, creation, of, eve, the, composition, of, which, was, to, reappear, on, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, towards, the, end, of, 1495, the, political, situation, in, florence, was, calmer, the, city, previously, under, threat, from, the, french, was, no, longer, in, danger, as, charles, viii, had, suffered, defeats, michelangelo, returned, to, florence, but, received, no, commissions, from, the, new, city, government, under, savonarola, he, returned, to, the, employment, of, the, medici, during, the, half, year, he, spent, in, florence, he, worked, on, two, small, statues, a, child, st, john, the, baptist, and, a, sleeping, cupid, according, to, condivi, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, for, whom, michelangelo, had, sculpted, st, john, the, baptist, asked, that, michelangelo, fix, it, so, that, it, looked, as, if, it, had, been, buried, so, he, could, send, it, to, rome, pass, an, ancient, work, and, sell, it, much, better, both, lorenzo, and, michelangelo, were, unwittingly, cheated, out, of, the, real, value, of, the, piece, by, a, middleman, cardinal, raffaele, riario, to, whom, lorenzo, had, sold, it, discovered, that, it, was, a, fraud, but, was, so, impressed, by, the, quality, of, the, sculpture, that, he, invited, the, artist, to, rome, this, apparent, success, in, selling, his, sculpture, abroad, as, well, as, the, conservative, florentine, situation, may, have, encouraged, michelangelo, to, accept, the, prelate, s, invitation, michelangelo, arrived, in, rome, on, 25, june, 1496, at, the, age, of, 21, on, 4, july, of, the, same, year, he, began, work, on, a, commission, for, cardinal, riario, an, over, life, size, statue, of, the, roman, wine, god, bacchus, upon, completion, the, work, was, rejected, by, the, cardinal, and, subsequently, entered, the, collection, of, the, banker, jacopo, galli, for, his, garden, in, november, 1497, the, french, ambassador, to, the, holy, see, cardinal, jean, de, bilh, res, lagraulas, commissioned, him, to, carve, a, piet, a, sculpture, showing, the, virgin, mary, grieving, over, the, body, of, jesus, the, subject, which, is, not, part, of, the, biblical, narrative, of, the, crucifixion, was, common, in, religious, sculpture, of, medieval, northern, europe, and, would, have, been, very, familiar, to, the, cardinal, the, contract, was, agreed, upon, in, august, of, the, following, year, michelangelo, was, 24, at, the, time, of, its, completion, it, was, soon, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, world, s, great, masterpieces, of, sculpture, a, revelation, of, all, the, potentialities, and, force, of, the, art, of, sculpture, contemporary, opinion, was, summarised, by, vasari, it, is, certainly, a, miracle, that, a, formless, block, of, stone, could, ever, have, been, reduced, to, a, perfection, that, nature, is, scarcely, able, to, create, in, the, flesh, it, is, now, located, in, st, peter, s, basilica, michelangelo, returned, to, florence, in, 1499, the, republic, was, changing, after, the, fall, of, its, leader, anti, renaissance, priest, girolamo, savonarola, who, was, executed, in, 1498, and, the, rise, of, the, gonfaloniere, piero, soderini, michelangelo, was, asked, by, the, consuls, of, the, guild, of, wool, to, complete, an, unfinished, project, begun, 40, years, earlier, by, agostino, di, duccio, a, colossal, statue, of, carrara, marble, portraying, david, as, a, symbol, of, florentine, freedom, to, be, placed, on, the, gable, of, florence, cathedral, michelangelo, responded, by, completing, his, most, famous, work, the, statue, of, david, in, 1504, the, masterwork, definitively, established, his, prominence, as, a, sculptor, of, extraordinary, technical, skill, and, strength, of, symbolic, imagination, a, team, of, consultants, including, botticelli, leonardo, da, vinci, filippino, lippi, pietro, perugino, lorenzo, di, credi, antonio, and, giuliano, da, sangallo, andrea, della, robbia, cosimo, rosselli, davide, ghirlandaio, piero, di, cosimo, andrea, sansovino, and, michelangelo, s, dear, friend, francesco, granacci, was, called, together, to, decide, upon, its, placement, ultimately, the, piazza, della, signoria, in, front, of, the, palazzo, vecchio, it, now, stands, in, the, academia, while, a, replica, occupies, its, place, in, the, square, in, the, same, period, of, placing, the, david, michelangelo, may, have, been, involved, in, creating, the, sculptural, profile, on, palazzo, vecchio, s, fa, ade, known, as, the, importuno, di, michelangelo, the, hypothesis, of, michelangelo, s, possible, involvement, in, the, creation, of, the, profile, is, based, on, the, strong, resemblance, of, the, latter, to, a, profile, drawn, by, the, artist, datable, to, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, now, preserved, in, the, louvre, with, the, completion, of, the, david, came, another, commission, in, early, 1504, leonardo, da, vinci, had, been, commissioned, to, paint, the, battle, of, anghiari, in, the, council, chamber, of, the, palazzo, vecchio, depicting, the, battle, between, florence, and, milan, in, 1440, michelangelo, was, then, commissioned, to, paint, the, battle, of, cascina, the, two, paintings, are, very, different, leonardo, depicts, soldiers, fighting, on, horseback, while, michelangelo, has, soldiers, being, ambushed, as, they, bathe, in, the, river, neither, work, was, completed, and, both, were, lost, forever, when, the, chamber, was, refurbished, both, works, were, much, admired, and, copies, remain, of, them, leonardo, s, work, having, been, copied, by, rubens, and, michelangelo, s, by, bastiano, da, sangallo, also, during, this, period, michelangelo, was, commissioned, by, angelo, doni, to, paint, a, holy, family, as, a, present, for, his, wife, maddalena, strozzi, it, is, known, as, the, doni, tondo, and, hangs, in, the, uffizi, gallery, in, its, original, magnificent, frame, which, michelangelo, may, have, designed, he, also, may, have, painted, the, madonna, and, child, with, john, the, baptist, known, as, the, manchester, madonna, and, now, in, the, national, gallery, london, in, 1505, michelangelo, was, invited, back, to, rome, by, the, newly, elected, pope, julius, ii, and, commissioned, to, build, the, pope, s, tomb, which, was, to, include, forty, statues, and, be, finished, in, five, years, under, the, patronage, of, the, pope, michelangelo, experienced, constant, interruptions, to, his, work, on, the, tomb, in, order, to, accomplish, numerous, other, tasks, the, commission, for, the, tomb, forced, the, artist, to, leave, florence, with, his, planned, battle, of, cascina, painting, unfinished, by, this, time, michelangelo, was, established, as, an, artist, both, he, and, julius, ii, had, hot, tempers, and, soon, argued, on, 17, april, 1506, michelangelo, left, rome, in, secret, for, florence, remaining, there, until, the, florentine, government, pressed, him, to, return, to, the, pope, although, michelangelo, worked, on, the, tomb, for, 40, years, it, was, never, finished, to, his, satisfaction, it, is, located, in, the, church, of, san, pietro, in, vincoli, in, rome, and, is, most, famous, for, the, central, figure, of, moses, completed, in, 1516, of, the, other, statues, intended, for, the, tomb, two, known, as, the, rebellious, slave, and, the, dying, slave, are, now, in, the, louvre, during, the, same, period, michelangelo, painted, the, ceiling, of, the, sistine, chapel, which, took, approximately, four, years, to, complete, 1508, 1512, according, to, condivi, s, account, bramante, who, was, working, on, the, building, of, st, peter, s, basilica, resented, michelangelo, s, commission, for, the, pope, s, tomb, and, convinced, the, pope, to, commission, him, in, a, medium, with, which, he, was, unfamiliar, in, order, that, he, might, fail, at, the, task, michelangelo, was, originally, commissioned, to, paint, the, twelve, apostles, on, the, triangular, pendentives, that, supported, the, ceiling, and, to, cover, the, central, part, of, the, ceiling, with, ornament, michelangelo, persuaded, pope, julius, ii, to, give, him, a, free, hand, and, proposed, a, different, and, more, complex, scheme, representing, the, creation, the, fall, of, man, the, promise, of, salvation, through, the, prophets, and, the, genealogy, of, christ, the, work, is, part, of, a, larger, scheme, of, decoration, within, the, chapel, that, represents, much, of, the, doctrine, of, the, catholic, church, the, composition, stretches, over, 500, square, metres, of, ceiling, and, contains, over, 300, figures, at, its, centre, are, nine, episodes, from, the, book, of, genesis, divided, into, three, groups, god, s, creation, of, the, earth, god, s, creation, of, humankind, and, their, fall, from, god, s, grace, and, lastly, the, state, of, humanity, as, represented, by, noah, and, his, family, on, the, pendentives, supporting, the, ceiling, are, painted, twelve, men, and, women, who, prophesied, the, coming, of, jesus, seven, prophets, of, israel, and, five, sibyls, prophetic, women, of, the, classical, world, among, the, most, famous, paintings, on, the, ceiling, are, the, creation, of, adam, adam, and, eve, in, the, garden, of, eden, the, deluge, the, prophet, jeremiah, and, the, cumaean, sibyl, in, 1513, pope, julius, ii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, pope, leo, x, the, second, son, of, lorenzo, de, medici, from, 1513, to, 1516, pope, leo, was, on, good, terms, with, pope, julius, s, surviving, relatives, so, encouraged, michelangelo, to, continue, work, on, julius, s, tomb, but, the, families, became, enemies, again, in, 1516, when, pope, leo, tried, to, seize, the, duchy, of, urbino, from, julius, s, nephew, francesco, maria, i, della, rovere, pope, leo, then, had, michelangelo, stop, working, on, the, tomb, and, commissioned, him, to, reconstruct, the, fa, ade, of, the, basilica, of, san, lorenzo, in, florence, and, to, adorn, it, with, sculptures, he, spent, three, years, creating, drawings, and, models, for, the, fa, ade, as, well, as, attempting, to, open, a, new, marble, quarry, at, pietrasanta, specifically, for, the, project, in, 1520, the, work, was, abruptly, cancelled, by, his, financially, strapped, patrons, before, any, real, progress, had, been, made, the, basilica, lacks, a, fa, ade, to, this, day, in, 1520, the, medici, came, back, to, michelangelo, with, another, grand, proposal, this, time, for, a, family, funerary, chapel, in, the, basilica, of, san, lorenzo, for, posterity, this, project, occupying, the, artist, for, much, of, the, 1520s, and, 1530s, was, more, fully, realised, michelangelo, used, his, own, discretion, to, create, the, composition, of, the, medici, chapel, which, houses, the, large, tombs, of, two, of, the, younger, members, of, the, medici, family, giuliano, duke, of, nemours, and, lorenzo, his, nephew, it, also, serves, to, commemorate, their, more, famous, predecessors, lorenzo, the, magnificent, and, his, brother, giuliano, who, are, buried, nearby, the, tombs, display, statues, of, the, two, medici, and, allegorical, figures, representing, night, and, day, and, dusk, and, dawn, the, chapel, also, contains, michelangelo, s, medici, madonna, in, 1976, a, concealed, corridor, was, discovered, with, drawings, on, the, walls, that, related, to, the, chapel, itself, pope, leo, x, died, in, 1521, and, was, succeeded, briefly, by, the, austere, adrian, vi, and, then, by, his, cousin, giulio, medici, as, pope, clement, vii, in, 1524, michelangelo, received, an, architectural, commission, from, the, medici, pope, for, the, laurentian, library, at, san, lorenzo, s, church, he, designed, both, the, interior, of, the, library, itself, and, its, vestibule, a, building, utilising, architectural, forms, with, such, dynamic, effect, that, it, is, seen, as, the, forerunner, of, baroque, architecture, it, was, left, to, assistants, to, interpret, his, plans, and, carry, out, construction, the, library, was, not, opened, until, 1571, and, the, vestibule, remained, incomplete, until, 1904, in, 1527, florentine, citizens, encouraged, by, the, sack, of, rome, threw, out, the, medici, and, restored, the, republic, a, siege, of, the, city, ensued, and, michelangelo, went, to, the, aid, of, his, beloved, florence, by, working, on, the, city, s, fortifications, from, 1528, to, 1529, the, city, fell, in, 1530, and, the, medici, were, restored, to, power, with, the, young, alessandro, medici, as, the, first, duke, of, florence, pope, clement, a, medici, sentenced, michelangelo, to, death, it, is, thought, that, michelangelo, hid, for, two, months, in, a, small, chamber, under, the, medici, chapels, in, the, basilica, of, san, lorenzo, with, light, from, just, a, tiny, window, making, many, charcoal, and, chalk, drawings, which, remained, hidden, until, the, room, was, rediscovered, in, 1975, and, opened, to, small, numbers, of, visitors, in, 2023, michelangelo, was, eventually, pardoned, by, the, medicis, and, the, death, sentence, lifted, so, that, he, could, complete, work, on, the, sistine, chapel, and, the, medici, family, tomb, he, left, florence, for, rome, in, 1534, despite, michelangelo, s, support, of, the, republic, and, resistance, to, the, medici, rule, pope, clement, reinstated, an, allowance, that, he, had, previously, granted, the, artist, and, made, a, new, contract, with, him, over, the, tomb, of, pope, julius, in, rome, michelangelo, lived, near, the, church, of, santa, maria, di, loreto, it, was, at, this, time, that, he, met, the, poet, vittoria, colonna, marchioness, of, pescara, who, was, to, become, one, of, his, closest, friends, until, her, death, in, 1547, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1534, pope, clement, vii, commissioned, michelangelo, to, paint, a, fresco, of, the, last, judgment, on, the, altar, wall, of, the, sistine, chapel, his, successor, pope, paul, iii, was, instrumental, in, seeing, that, michelangelo, began, and, completed, the, project, which, he, laboured, on, from, 1534, to, october, 1541, the, fresco, depicts, the, second, coming, of, christ, and, his, judgement, of, the, souls, michelangelo, ignored, the, usual, artistic, conventions, in, portraying, jesus, showing, him, as, a, massive, muscular, figure, youthful, beardless, and, naked, he, is, surrounded, by, saints, among, whom, saint, bartholomew, holds, a, drooping, flayed, skin, bearing, the, likeness, of, michelangelo, the, dead, rise, from, their, graves, to, be, consigned, either, to, heaven, or, to, hell, once, completed, the, depiction, of, christ, and, the, virgin, mary, naked, was, considered, sacrilegious, and, cardinal, carafa, and, monsignor, sernini, mantua, s, ambassador, campaigned, to, have, the, fresco, removed, or, censored, but, the, pope, resisted, at, the, council, of, trent, shortly, before, michelangelo, s, death, in, 1564, it, was, decided, to, obscure, the, genitals, and, daniele, da, volterra, an, apprentice, of, michelangelo, was, commissioned, to, make, the, alterations, an, uncensored, copy, of, the, original, by, marcello, venusti, is, in, the, capodimonte, museum, of, naples, michelangelo, worked, on, a, number, of, architectural, projects, at, this, time, they, included, a, design, for, the, capitoline, hill, with, its, trapezoid, piazza, displaying, the, ancient, bronze, statue, of, marcus, aurelius, he, designed, the, upper, floor, of, the, palazzo, farnese, and, the, interior, of, the, church, of, santa, maria, degli, angeli, in, which, he, transformed, the, vaulted, interior, of, an, ancient, roman, bathhouse, other, architectural, works, include, san, giovanni, dei, fiorentini, the, sforza, chapel, capella, sforza, in, the, basilica, di, santa, maria, maggiore, and, the, porta, pia, while, still, working, on, the, last, judgment, michelangelo, received, yet, another, commission, for, the, vatican, this, was, for, the, painting, of, two, large, frescos, in, the, cappella, paolina, depicting, significant, events, in, the, lives, of, the, two, most, important, saints, of, rome, the, conversion, of, saint, paul, and, the, crucifixion, of, saint, peter, like, the, last, judgment, these, two, works, are, complex, compositions, containing, a, great, number, of, figures, they, were, completed, in, 1550, in, the, same, year, giorgio, vasari, published, his, vita, including, a, biography, of, michelangelo, in, 1546, michelangelo, was, appointed, architect, of, st, peter, s, basilica, rome, the, process, of, replacing, the, constantinian, basilica, of, the, 4th, century, had, been, underway, for, fifty, years, and, in, 1506, foundations, had, been, laid, to, the, plans, of, bramante, successive, architects, had, worked, on, it, but, little, progress, had, been, made, michelangelo, was, persuaded, to, take, over, the, project, he, returned, to, the, concepts, of, bramante, and, developed, his, ideas, for, a, centrally, planned, church, strengthening, the, structure, both, physically, and, visually, the, dome, not, completed, until, after, his, death, has, been, called, by, banister, fletcher, the, greatest, creation, of, the, renaissance, as, construction, was, progressing, on, st, peter, s, there, was, concern, that, michelangelo, would, die, before, the, dome, was, finished, however, once, building, commenced, on, the, lower, part, of, the, dome, the, supporting, ring, the, completion, of, the, design, was, inevitable, on, 7, december, 2007, a, red, chalk, sketch, for, the, dome, of, st, peter, s, basilica, possibly, the, last, made, by, michelangelo, before, his, death, was, discovered, in, the, vatican, archives, it, is, extremely, rare, since, he, destroyed, his, designs, later, in, life, the, sketch, is, a, partial, plan, for, one, of, the, radial, columns, of, the, cupola, drum, of, st, peter, s, michelangelo, was, a, devout, catholic, whose, faith, deepened, at, the, end, of, his, life, along, with, raphael, he, was, enrolled, in, the, secular, franciscan, order, his, poetry, includes, the, following, closing, lines, from, what, is, known, as, poem, 285, written, in, 1554, neither, painting, nor, sculpture, will, be, able, any, longer, to, calm, my, soul, now, turned, toward, that, divine, love, that, opened, his, arms, on, the, cross, to, take, us, in, michelangelo, was, abstemious, in, his, personal, life, and, once, told, his, apprentice, ascanio, condivi, however, rich, i, may, have, been, i, have, always, lived, like, a, poor, man, michelangelo, s, bank, accounts, and, numerous, deeds, of, purchase, show, that, his, net, worth, was, about, 50, 000, gold, ducats, more, than, many, princes, and, dukes, of, his, time, condivi, said, he, was, indifferent, to, food, and, drink, eating, more, out, of, necessity, than, of, pleasure, and, that, he, often, slept, in, his, clothes, and, boots, his, biographer, paolo, giovio, says, his, nature, was, so, rough, and, uncouth, that, his, domestic, habits, were, incredibly, squalid, and, deprived, posterity, of, any, pupils, who, might, have, followed, him, this, however, may, not, have, affected, him, as, he, was, by, nature, a, solitary, and, melancholy, person, bizzarro, e, fantastico, a, man, who, withdrew, himself, from, the, company, of, men, love, for, a, lady, s, different, not, much, in, that, for, a, wise, and, virile, lover, s, trouble, it, is, impossible, to, know, whether, michelangelo, had, any, physical, relationships, understanding, about, his, sexuality, is, rooted, in, his, art, especially, his, poetry, he, wrote, more, than, three, hundred, sonnets, and, madrigals, about, sixty, are, addressed, to, men, the, first, significant, modern, corpus, of, love, poetry, from, one, man, to, another, the, longest, sequence, displaying, deep, loving, feeling, was, written, to, the, young, roman, patrician, tommaso, dei, cavalieri, c, 1509, 1587, who, was, 23, years, old, when, michelangelo, first, met, him, in, 1532, at, the, age, of, 57, in, his, lives, of, the, artists, giorgio, vasari, observed, but, infinitely, more, than, any, of, the, others, he, loved, m, tommaso, de, cavalieri, a, roman, gentleman, for, whom, being, a, young, man, and, much, inclined, to, these, arts, made, to, the, end, that, he, might, learn, to, draw, many, most, superb, drawings, of, divinely, beautiful, heads, designed, in, black, and, red, chalk, and, then, he, drew, for, him, a, ganymede, rapt, to, heaven, by, jove, s, eagle, a, tityus, with, the, vulture, devouring, his, heart, the, chariot, of, the, sun, falling, with, pha, thon, into, the, po, and, a, bacchanal, of, children, which, are, all, in, themselves, most, rare, things, and, drawings, the, like, of, which, have, never, been, seen, some, scholars, downplay, the, relationship, between, michelangelo, and, cavalieri, as, one, of, platonic, friendship, the, poems, to, cavalieri, make, up, the, first, large, sequence, of, poems, in, any, modern, tongue, addressed, by, one, man, to, another, they, predate, by, 50, years, shakespeare, s, sonnets, to, the, fair, youth, i, feel, as, lit, by, fire, a, cold, countenance, that, burns, me, from, afar, and, keeps, itself, ice, chill, a, strength, i, feel, two, shapely, arms, to, fill, which, without, motion, moves, every, balance, cavalieri, replied, i, swear, to, return, your, love, never, have, i, loved, a, man, more, than, i, love, you, never, have, i, wished, for, a, friendship, more, than, i, wish, for, yours, cavalieri, remained, devoted, to, michelangelo, until, his, death, in, 1542, michelangelo, met, cecchino, dei, bracci, who, died, only, a, year, later, inspiring, michelangelo, to, write, 48, funeral, epigrams, some, of, the, objects, of, michelangelo, s, affections, and, subjects, of, his, poetry, took, advantage, of, him, the, model, febo, di, poggio, asked, for, money, in, response, to, a, love, poem, and, a, second, model, gherardo, perini, shamelessly, stole, from, him, the, nature, of, the, poetry, has, been, a, source, of, discomfort, to, later, generations, michelangelo, s, grandnephew, michelangelo, buonarroti, the, younger, published, the, poems, in, 1623, with, the, gender, of, pronouns, changed, he, also, removed, words, or, in, other, instances, insisted, that, michelangelo, s, poems, be, read, allegorically, and, philosophically, a, judgment, some, modern, scholars, still, repeat, today, it, was, not, until, john, addington, symonds, translated, the, poems, into, english, in, 1893, that, the, original, genders, were, restored, since, then, it, has, become, more, accepted, that, his, poems, should, be, understood, at, face, value, that, is, as, indicating, his, personal, feelings, and, a, preference, by, him, for, young, men, over, women, late, in, life, michelangelo, nurtured, a, friendship, with, the, poet, and, noble, widow, vittoria, colonna, whom, he, met, in, rome, in, 1536, or, 1538, and, who, was, in, her, late, forties, at, the, time, they, wrote, sonnets, for, each, other, and, were, in, regular, contact, until, she, died, these, sonnets, mostly, deal, with, the, spiritual, issues, that, occupied, them, condivi, who, in, his, biography, was, preoccupied, with, downplaying, michelangelo, s, attraction, to, men, alleged, michelangelo, said, his, sole, regret, in, life, was, that, he, did, not, kiss, the, widow, s, face, in, the, same, manner, that, he, had, her, hand, in, a, letter, from, late, 1542, michelangelo, blamed, the, tensions, between, julius, ii, and, him, on, the, envy, of, bramante, and, raphael, saying, of, the, latter, all, he, had, in, art, he, got, from, me, according, to, gian, paolo, lomazzo, michelangelo, and, raphael, met, once, the, former, was, alone, while, the, latter, was, accompanied, by, several, others, michelangelo, commented, that, he, thought, he, had, encountered, the, chief, of, police, with, such, an, assemblage, and, raphael, replied, that, he, thought, he, had, met, an, executioner, as, they, are, wont, to, walk, alone, the, madonna, of, the, stairs, is, michelangelo, s, earliest, known, work, in, marble, it, is, carved, in, shallow, relief, a, technique, often, employed, by, the, master, sculptor, of, the, early, 15th, century, donatello, and, others, such, as, desiderio, da, settignano, while, the, madonna, is, in, profile, the, easiest, aspect, for, a, shallow, relief, the, child, displays, a, twisting, motion, that, was, to, become, characteristic, of, michelangelo, s, work, the, taddei, tondo, of, 1502, shows, the, christ, child, frightened, by, a, bullfinch, a, symbol, of, the, crucifixion, the, lively, form, of, the, child, was, later, adapted, by, raphael, in, the, bridgewater, madonna, the, madonna, of, bruges, was, at, the, time, of, its, creation, unlike, other, such, statues, depicting, the, virgin, proudly, presenting, her, son, here, the, christ, child, restrained, by, his, mother, s, clasping, hand, is, about, to, step, off, into, the, world, the, doni, tondo, depicting, the, holy, family, has, elements, of, all, three, previous, works, the, frieze, of, figures, in, the, background, has, the, appearance, of, a, low, relief, while, the, circular, shape, and, dynamic, forms, echo, the, taddeo, tondo, the, twisting, motion, present, in, the, madonna, of, bruges, is, accentuated, in, the, painting, the, painting, heralds, the, forms, movement, and, colour, that, michelangelo, was, to, employ, on, the, ceiling, of, the, sistine, chapel, the, kneeling, angel, is, an, early, work, one, of, several, that, michelangelo, created, as, part, of, a, large, decorative, scheme, for, the, arca, di, san, domenico, in, the, church, dedicated, to, that, saint, in, bologna, several, other, artists, had, worked, on, the, scheme, beginning, with, nicola, pisano, in, the, 13th, century, in, the, late, 15th, century, the, project, was, managed, by, niccol, dell, arca, an, angel, holding, a, candlestick, by, niccol, was, already, in, place, although, the, two, angels, form, a, pair, there, is, a, great, contrast, between, the, two, works, the, one, depicting, a, delicate, child, with, flowing, hair, clothed, in, gothic, robes, with, deep, folds, and, michelangelo, s, depicting, a, robust, and, muscular, youth, with, eagle, s, wings, clad, in, a, garment, of, classical, style, everything, about, michelangelo, s, angel, is, dynamic, michelangelo, s, bacchus, was, a, commission, with, a, specified, subject, the, youthful, god, of, wine, the, sculpture, has, all, the, traditional, attributes, a, vine, wreath, a, cup, of, wine, and, a, fawn, but, michelangelo, ingested, an, air, of, reality, into, the, subject, depicting, him, with, bleary, eyes, a, swollen, bladder, and, a, stance, that, suggests, he, is, unsteady, on, his, feet, while, the, work, is, plainly, inspired, by, classical, sculpture, it, is, innovative, for, its, rotating, movement, and, strongly, three, dimensional, quality, which, encourages, the, viewer, to, look, at, it, from, every, angle, in, the, so, called, dying, slave, michelangelo, again, utilised, the, figure, with, marked, contrapposto, to, suggest, a, particular, human, state, in, this, case, waking, from, sleep, with, the, rebellious, slave, it, is, one, of, two, such, earlier, figures, for, the, tomb, of, pope, julius, ii, now, in, the, louvre, that, the, sculptor, brought, to, an, almost, finished, state, these, two, works, were, to, have, a, profound, influence, on, later, sculpture, through, rodin, who, studied, them, at, the, louvre, the, atlas, slave, is, one, of, the, later, figures, for, pope, julius, tomb, the, works, known, collectively, as, the, captives, each, show, the, figure, struggling, to, free, itself, as, if, from, the, bonds, of, the, rock, in, which, it, is, lodged, the, works, give, a, unique, insight, into, the, sculptural, methods, that, michelangelo, employed, and, his, way, of, revealing, what, he, perceived, within, the, rock, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, was, painted, between, 1508, and, 1512, the, ceiling, is, a, flattened, barrel, vault, supported, on, twelve, triangular, pendentives, that, rise, from, between, the, windows, of, the, chapel, the, commission, as, envisaged, by, pope, julius, ii, was, to, adorn, the, pendentives, with, figures, of, the, twelve, apostles, michelangelo, who, was, reluctant, to, take, the, job, persuaded, the, pope, to, give, him, a, free, hand, in, the, composition, the, resultant, scheme, of, decoration, awed, his, contemporaries, and, has, inspired, other, artists, ever, since, the, scheme, is, of, nine, panels, illustrating, episodes, from, the, book, of, genesis, set, in, an, architectonic, frame, on, the, pendentives, michelangelo, replaced, the, proposed, apostles, with, prophets, and, sibyls, who, heralded, the, coming, of, the, messiah, michelangelo, began, painting, with, the, later, episodes, in, the, narrative, the, pictures, including, locational, details, and, groups, of, figures, the, drunkenness, of, noah, being, the, first, of, this, group, in, the, later, compositions, painted, after, the, initial, scaffolding, had, been, removed, michelangelo, made, the, figures, larger, one, of, the, central, images, the, creation, of, adam, is, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, reproduced, works, in, the, history, of, art, the, final, panel, showing, the, separation, of, light, from, darkness, is, the, broadest, in, style, and, was, painted, in, a, single, day, as, the, model, for, the, creator, michelangelo, has, depicted, himself, in, the, action, of, painting, the, ceiling, as, supporters, to, the, smaller, scenes, michelangelo, painted, twenty, youths, who, have, variously, been, interpreted, as, angels, as, muses, or, simply, as, decoration, michelangelo, referred, to, them, as, ignudi, the, figure, reproduced, may, be, seen, in, context, in, the, above, image, of, the, separation, of, light, from, darkness, in, the, process, of, painting, the, ceiling, michelangelo, made, studies, for, different, figures, of, which, some, such, as, that, for, the, libyan, sibyl, have, survived, demonstrating, the, care, taken, by, michelangelo, in, details, such, as, the, hands, and, feet, the, prophet, jeremiah, contemplating, the, downfall, of, jerusalem, is, a, self, portrait, michelangelo, s, relief, of, the, battle, of, the, centaurs, created, while, he, was, still, a, youth, associated, with, the, medici, academy, is, an, unusually, complex, relief, in, that, it, shows, a, great, number, of, figures, involved, in, a, vigorous, struggle, such, a, complex, disarray, of, figures, was, rare, in, florentine, art, where, it, would, usually, only, be, found, in, images, showing, either, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, or, the, torments, of, hell, the, relief, treatment, in, which, some, of, the, figures, are, boldly, projecting, may, indicate, michelangelo, s, familiarity, with, roman, sarcophagus, reliefs, from, the, collection, of, lorenzo, medici, and, similar, marble, panels, created, by, nicola, and, giovanni, pisano, and, with, the, figurative, compositions, on, ghiberti, s, baptistry, doors, the, composition, of, the, battle, of, cascina, is, known, in, its, entirety, only, from, copies, as, the, original, cartoon, according, to, vasari, was, so, admired, that, it, deteriorated, and, was, eventually, in, pieces, it, reflects, the, earlier, relief, in, the, energy, and, diversity, of, the, figures, with, many, different, postures, and, many, being, viewed, from, the, back, as, they, turn, towards, the, approaching, enemy, and, prepare, for, battle, in, the, last, judgment, it, is, said, that, michelangelo, drew, inspiration, from, a, fresco, by, melozzo, da, forl, in, rome, s, santi, apostoli, melozzo, had, depicted, figures, from, different, angles, as, if, they, were, floating, in, the, heaven, and, seen, from, below, melozzo, s, majestic, figure, of, christ, with, windblown, cloak, demonstrates, a, degree, of, foreshortening, of, the, figure, that, had, also, been, employed, by, andrea, mantegna, but, was, not, usual, in, the, frescos, of, florentine, painters, in, the, last, judgment, michelangelo, had, the, opportunity, to, depict, on, an, unprecedented, scale, figures, in, the, action, of, either, rising, heavenward, or, falling, and, being, dragged, down, in, the, two, frescos, of, the, pauline, chapel, the, crucifixion, of, st, peter, and, the, conversion, of, saul, michelangelo, has, used, the, various, groups, of, figures, to, convey, a, complex, narrative, in, the, crucifixion, of, peter, soldiers, busy, themselves, about, their, assigned, duty, of, digging, a, post, hole, and, raising, the, cross, while, various, people, look, on, and, discuss, the, events, a, group, of, horrified, women, cluster, in, the, foreground, while, another, group, of, christians, is, led, by, a, tall, man, to, witness, the, events, in, the, right, foreground, michelangelo, walks, out, of, the, painting, with, an, expression, of, disillusionment, michelangelo, s, architectural, commissions, included, a, number, that, were, not, realised, notably, the, fa, ade, for, brunelleschi, s, church, of, san, lorenzo, in, florence, for, which, michelangelo, had, a, wooden, model, constructed, but, which, remains, to, this, day, unfinished, rough, brick, at, the, same, church, giulio, de, medici, later, pope, clement, vii, commissioned, him, to, design, the, medici, chapel, and, the, tombs, of, giuliano, and, lorenzo, medici, pope, clement, also, commissioned, the, laurentian, library, for, which, michelangelo, also, designed, the, extraordinary, vestibule, with, columns, recessed, into, niches, and, a, staircase, that, appears, to, spill, out, of, the, library, like, a, flow, of, lava, according, to, nikolaus, pevsner, revealing, mannerism, in, its, most, sublime, architectural, form, in, 1546, michelangelo, produced, the, highly, complex, ovoid, design, for, the, pavement, of, the, campidoglio, and, began, designing, an, upper, storey, for, the, farnese, palace, in, 1547, he, took, on, the, job, of, completing, st, peter, s, basilica, begun, to, a, design, by, bramante, and, with, several, intermediate, designs, by, several, architects, michelangelo, returned, to, bramante, s, design, retaining, the, basic, form, and, concepts, by, simplifying, and, strengthening, the, design, to, create, a, more, dynamic, and, unified, whole, although, the, late, 16th, century, engraving, depicts, the, dome, as, having, a, hemispherical, profile, the, dome, of, michelangelo, s, model, is, somewhat, ovoid, and, the, final, product, as, completed, by, giacomo, della, porta, is, more, so, in, his, old, age, michelangelo, created, a, number, of, piet, s, in, which, he, apparently, reflects, upon, mortality, they, are, heralded, by, the, victory, perhaps, created, for, the, tomb, of, pope, julius, ii, but, left, unfinished, in, this, group, the, youthful, victor, overcomes, an, older, hooded, figure, with, the, features, of, michelangelo, the, piet, of, vittoria, colonna, is, a, chalk, drawing, of, a, type, described, as, presentation, drawings, as, they, might, be, given, as, a, gift, by, an, artist, and, were, not, necessarily, studies, towards, a, painted, work, in, this, image, mary, s, upraised, arms, and, hands, are, indicative, of, her, prophetic, role, the, frontal, aspect, is, reminiscent, of, masaccio, s, fresco, of, the, holy, trinity, in, the, basilica, of, santa, maria, novella, florence, in, the, florentine, piet, michelangelo, again, depicts, himself, this, time, as, the, aged, nicodemus, lowering, the, body, of, jesus, from, the, cross, into, the, arms, of, mary, his, mother, and, mary, magdalene, michelangelo, smashed, the, left, arm, and, leg, of, the, figure, of, jesus, his, pupil, tiberio, calcagni, repaired, the, arm, and, drilled, a, hole, in, which, to, fix, a, replacement, leg, which, was, not, subsequently, attached, he, also, worked, on, the, figure, of, mary, magdalene, the, last, sculpture, that, michelangelo, worked, on, six, days, before, his, death, the, rondanini, piet, could, never, be, completed, because, michelangelo, carved, it, away, until, there, was, insufficient, stone, the, legs, and, a, detached, arm, remain, from, a, previous, stage, of, the, work, as, it, remains, the, sculpture, has, an, abstract, quality, in, keeping, with, 20th, century, concepts, of, sculpture, michelangelo, died, in, rome, on, 18, february, 1564, at, the, age, of, 88, his, body, was, taken, from, rome, for, interment, at, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, fulfilling, the, maestro, s, last, request, to, be, buried, in, his, beloved, florence, michelangelo, s, heir, lionardo, buonarroti, commissioned, giorgio, vasari, to, design, and, build, the, tomb, of, michelangelo, a, monumental, project, that, cost, 770, scudi, and, took, over, 14, years, to, complete, marble, for, the, tomb, was, supplied, by, cosimo, i, de, medici, duke, of, tuscany, who, had, also, organized, a, state, funeral, to, honour, michelangelo, in, florence, michelangelo, with, leonardo, da, vinci, and, raphael, is, one, of, the, three, giants, of, the, florentine, high, renaissance, although, their, names, are, often, cited, together, michelangelo, was, younger, than, leonardo, by, 23, years, and, older, than, raphael, by, eight, because, of, his, reclusive, nature, he, had, little, to, do, with, either, artist, and, outlived, both, of, them, by, more, than, forty, years, michelangelo, took, few, sculpture, students, he, employed, francesco, granacci, who, was, his, fellow, pupil, at, the, medici, academy, and, became, one, of, several, assistants, on, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, michelangelo, appears, to, have, used, assistants, mainly, for, the, more, manual, tasks, of, preparing, surfaces, and, grinding, colours, despite, this, his, works, were, to, have, a, great, influence, on, painters, sculptors, and, architects, for, many, generations, to, come, while, michelangelo, s, david, is, the, most, famous, male, nude, of, all, time, and, copies, of, it, now, grace, cities, around, the, world, some, of, his, other, works, have, had, perhaps, even, greater, impact, on, the, course, of, art, the, twisting, forms, and, tensions, of, the, victory, the, bruges, madonna, and, the, medici, madonna, make, them, the, heralds, of, the, mannerist, art, the, unfinished, giants, for, the, tomb, of, pope, julius, ii, had, profound, effect, on, late, 19th, and, 20th, century, sculptors, such, as, rodin, and, henry, moore, michelangelo, s, vestibule, of, the, laurentian, library, was, one, of, the, earliest, buildings, to, use, classical, forms, in, a, plastic, and, expressive, manner, this, dynamic, quality, was, later, to, find, its, major, expression, in, his, centrally, planned, st, peter, s, with, its, giant, order, its, rippling, cornice, and, its, upward, launching, pointed, dome, the, dome, of, st, peter, s, was, to, influence, the, building, of, churches, for, many, centuries, including, sant, andrea, della, valle, in, rome, and, st, paul, s, cathedral, london, as, well, as, the, civic, domes, of, many, public, buildings, and, the, state, capitals, across, america, artists, who, were, directly, influenced, by, michelangelo, include, raphael, whose, monumental, treatment, of, the, figure, in, the, school, of, athens, and, the, expulsion, of, heliodorus, from, the, temple, owes, much, to, michelangelo, and, whose, fresco, of, isaiah, in, sant, agostino, closely, imitates, the, older, master, s, prophets, other, artists, such, as, pontormo, drew, on, the, writhing, forms, of, the, last, judgment, and, the, frescoes, of, the, cappella, paolina, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, was, a, work, of, unprecedented, grandeur, both, for, its, architectonic, forms, to, be, imitated, by, many, baroque, ceiling, painters, and, also, for, the, wealth, of, its, inventiveness, in, the, study, of, figures, vasari, wrote, the, work, has, proved, a, veritable, beacon, to, our, art, of, inestimable, benefit, to, all, painters, restoring, light, to, a, world, that, for, centuries, had, been, plunged, into, darkness, indeed, painters, no, longer, need, to, seek, for, new, inventions, novel, attitudes, clothed, figures, fresh, ways, of, expression, different, arrangements, or, sublime, subjects, for, this, work, contains, every, perfection, possible, under, those, headings
