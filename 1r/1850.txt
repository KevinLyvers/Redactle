25, consecutive, title, defenses, a, record, for, all, weight, classes, louis, had, the, longest, single, reign, as, champion, of, any, boxer, in, history, louis, s, cultural, impact, was, felt, well, outside, the, ring, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, first, african, american, to, achieve, the, status, of, a, nationwide, hero, within, the, united, states, and, was, also, a, focal, point, of, anti, nazi, sentiment, leading, up, to, and, during, world, war, ii, because, of, his, historic, rematch, with, german, boxer, max, schmeling, in, 1938, he, was, instrumental, in, integrating, the, game, of, golf, helping, break, the, sport, s, color, barrier, in, america, by, appearing, under, a, sponsor, s, exemption, in, a, pga, event, in, 1952, born, on, may, 13, 1914, in, rural, chambers, county, alabama, in, a, ramshackle, dwelling, on, bell, chapel, road, located, about, 1, mile, 2, kilometres, off, state, route, 50, and, roughly, 6, miles, 10, kilometres, from, lafayette, louis, was, the, seventh, of, eight, children, of, munroe, barrow, and, lillie, reese, barrow, he, weighed, 11, pounds, 5, kg, at, birth, both, of, his, parents, were, children, of, former, slaves, alternating, between, sharecropping, and, rental, farming, louis, suffered, from, a, speech, impediment, and, spoke, very, little, until, about, the, age, of, six, munroe, barrow, was, committed, to, a, mental, institution, in, 1916, and, as, a, result, joe, knew, very, little, of, his, biological, father, around, 1920, louis, s, mother, married, pat, brooks, a, local, construction, contractor, having, received, word, that, munroe, barrow, had, died, while, institutionalized, in, reality, munroe, barrow, lived, until, 1938, unaware, of, his, son, s, fame, in, 1926, shaken, by, a, gang, of, white, men, in, the, ku, klux, klan, louis, s, family, moved, to, detroit, michigan, forming, part, of, the, post, world, war, i, great, migration, joe, s, brother, worked, for, ford, motor, company, where, joe, would, himself, work, for, a, time, at, the, river, rouge, plant, and, the, family, settled, into, a, home, at, 2700, catherine, now, madison, street, in, detroit, s, black, bottom, neighborhood, louis, attended, bronson, vocational, school, for, a, time, to, learn, cabinet, making, the, great, depression, severely, affected, the, barrow, family, but, joe, still, made, time, to, work, out, at, a, local, youth, recreation, center, at, 637, brewster, street, in, detroit, his, mother, attempted, to, get, him, interested, in, playing, the, violin, he, is, rumoured, to, have, tried, to, hide, his, pugilistic, ambitions, from, his, mother, by, carrying, his, boxing, gloves, inside, his, violin, case, louis, made, his, debut, in, early, 1932, at, the, age, of, 17, legend, has, it, that, before, the, fight, the, barely, literate, louis, wrote, his, name, so, large, that, there, was, no, room, for, his, last, name, and, thus, became, known, as, joe, louis, for, the, remainder, of, his, boxing, career, more, likely, louis, simply, omitted, his, last, name, to, keep, his, boxing, a, secret, from, his, mother, after, this, debut, a, loss, to, future, olympian, johnny, miler, louis, compiled, numerous, amateur, victories, eventually, winning, the, club, championship, of, his, brewster, street, recreation, center, the, home, of, many, aspiring, golden, gloves, fighters, in, 1933, louis, won, the, detroit, area, golden, gloves, novice, division, championship, against, joe, biskey, for, the, light, heavyweight, classification, he, later, lost, in, the, chicago, golden, gloves, tournament, of, champions, the, next, year, competing, in, the, golden, gloves, open, division, he, won, the, light, heavyweight, classification, this, time, also, winning, the, chicago, tournament, of, champions, against, joe, bauer, however, a, hand, injury, forced, louis, to, miss, the, new, york, chicago, champions, cross, town, bout, for, the, ultimate, golden, gloves, championship, in, april, 1934, he, followed, up, his, chicago, performance, by, winning, the, light, heavyweight, united, states, amateur, champion, national, aau, tournament, in, st, louis, missouri, by, the, end, of, his, amateur, career, louis, s, record, was, 50, 4, with, 43, knockouts, joe, louis, had, only, three, losses, in, his, 69, professional, fights, he, tallied, 52, knockouts, and, held, the, championship, from, 1937, to, 1949, the, longest, span, of, any, heavyweight, titleholder, after, returning, from, retirement, louis, failed, to, regain, the, championship, in, 1950, and, his, career, ended, after, he, was, knocked, out, by, rocky, marciano, in, 1951, louis, s, amateur, performances, attracted, the, interest, of, professional, promoters, and, he, was, soon, represented, by, a, black, detroit, area, bookmaker, named, john, roxborough, as, louis, explained, in, his, autobiography, roxborough, convinced, the, young, fighter, that, white, managers, would, have, no, real, interest, in, seeing, a, black, boxer, work, his, way, up, to, title, contention, told, me, about, the, fate, of, most, black, fighters, ones, with, white, managers, who, wound, up, burned, out, and, broke, before, they, reached, their, prime, the, white, managers, were, not, interested, in, the, men, they, were, handling, but, in, the, money, they, could, make, from, them, they, didn, t, take, the, proper, time, to, see, that, their, fighters, had, a, proper, training, that, they, lived, comfortably, or, ate, well, or, had, some, pocket, change, mr, roxborough, was, talking, about, black, power, before, it, became, popular, roxborough, knew, a, chicago, area, boxing, promoter, named, julian, black, who, already, had, a, stable, of, mediocre, boxers, against, which, louis, could, hone, his, craft, this, time, in, the, heavyweight, division, after, becoming, part, of, the, management, team, black, hired, fellow, chicago, native, jack, chappy, blackburn, as, louis, s, trainer, louis, s, initial, professional, fights, were, all, in, the, chicago, area, his, professional, debut, coming, on, july, 4, 1934, against, jack, kracken, in, the, bacon, casino, on, chicago, s, south, side, louis, earned, 59, for, knocking, out, kracken, in, the, first, round, 59, in, 1934, is, equivalent, to, 1, 148, 60, in, 2020, dollars, louis, won, all, 12, of, his, professional, fights, that, year, 10, by, knockout, in, september, 1934, while, promoting, a, detroit, area, coming, home, bout, for, louis, against, canadian, alex, borchuk, roxborough, was, pressured, by, members, of, the, michigan, state, boxing, commission, to, have, louis, sign, with, white, management, roxborough, refused, and, continued, advancing, louis, s, career, with, bouts, against, heavyweight, contenders, art, sykes, and, stanley, poreda, while, training, for, a, fight, against, lee, ramage, louis, noticed, a, young, female, secretary, for, the, black, newspaper, at, the, gym, after, ramage, was, defeated, the, secretary, marva, trotter, was, invited, to, the, celebration, party, at, chicago, s, grand, hotel, trotter, later, became, louis, s, first, wife, in, 1935, during, this, time, louis, also, met, truman, gibson, the, man, who, would, become, his, personal, lawyer, as, a, young, associate, at, a, law, firm, hired, by, julian, black, gibson, was, charged, with, personally, entertaining, louis, during, the, pendency, of, business, deals, although, louis, s, management, was, finding, him, bouts, against, legitimate, heavyweight, contenders, no, path, to, the, title, was, forthcoming, while, professional, boxing, was, not, officially, segregated, many, white, americans, did, not, like, the, prospect, of, a, black, champion, in, 1908, during, an, era, of, severe, anti, black, repression, jack, johnson, became, the, first, black, heavyweight, champion, johnson, s, flamboyant, lifestyle, and, marriage, to, a, white, woman, engendered, an, enormous, backlash, that, greatly, limited, opportunities, of, black, fighters, in, the, heavyweight, division, black, boxers, were, denied, championship, bouts, and, there, were, few, heavyweight, black, contenders, at, the, time, though, there, were, african, americans, who, fought, for, titles, in, other, weight, divisions, and, a, few, notable, black, champions, such, as, tiger, flowers, louis, and, his, handlers, would, counter, the, legacy, of, johnson, by, emphasizing, the, brown, bomber, s, modesty, and, sportsmanship, biographer, gerald, astor, stated, that, joe, louis, early, boxing, career, was, stalked, by, the, specter, of, jack, johnson, if, louis, were, to, rise, to, national, prominence, among, such, cultural, attitudes, a, change, in, management, would, be, necessary, in, 1935, boxing, promoter, mike, jacobs, sought, out, louis, s, handlers, after, louis, s, narrow, defeat, of, natie, brown, on, march, 29, 1935, jacobs, and, the, louis, team, met, at, the, frog, club, a, black, nightclub, and, negotiated, a, three, year, exclusive, boxing, promotion, deal, the, contract, however, did, not, keep, roxborough, and, black, from, attempting, to, cash, in, as, louis, s, managers, when, louis, turned, 21, on, may, 13, 1935, roxborough, and, black, each, signed, louis, to, an, onerous, long, term, contract, that, collectively, dedicated, half, of, louis, s, future, income, to, the, pair, black, and, roxborough, continued, to, carefully, and, deliberately, shape, louis, s, media, image, mindful, of, the, tremendous, public, backlash, johnson, had, suffered, for, his, unapologetic, attitude, and, flamboyant, lifestyle, they, drafted, seven, commandments, for, louis, s, personal, conduct, these, included, as, a, result, louis, was, generally, portrayed, in, the, white, media, as, a, modest, clean, living, person, which, facilitated, his, burgeoning, celebrity, status, with, the, backing, of, a, major, promotion, louis, fought, thirteen, times, in, 1935, the, bout, that, helped, put, him, in, the, media, spotlight, occurred, on, june, 25, when, louis, knocked, out, 6, 6, 265, pound, former, world, heavyweight, champion, primo, carnera, in, six, rounds, foreshadowing, the, louis, schmeling, rivalry, to, come, the, carnera, bout, featured, a, political, dimension, louis, s, victory, over, carnera, who, symbolized, benito, mussolini, s, regime, in, the, popular, eye, was, seen, as, a, victory, for, the, international, community, particularly, among, african, americans, who, were, sympathetic, to, ethiopia, which, was, attempting, to, maintain, its, independence, by, fending, off, an, invasion, by, fascist, italy, america, s, white, press, began, promoting, louis, s, image, in, the, context, of, the, era, s, racism, nicknames, they, created, included, the, mahogany, mauler, chocolate, chopper, coffee, colored, ko, king, safari, sandman, and, one, that, stuck, the, brown, bomber, helping, the, white, press, to, overcome, its, reluctance, to, feature, a, black, contender, was, that, in, the, mid, 1930s, boxing, desperately, needed, a, marketable, hero, since, the, retirement, of, jack, dempsey, in, 1929, the, sport, had, devolved, into, a, sordid, mixture, of, poor, athletes, gambling, fixed, fights, thrown, matches, and, control, of, the, sport, by, organized, crime, new, york, times, columnist, edward, van, ness, wrote, louis, is, a, boon, to, boxing, just, as, dempsey, led, the, sport, out, of, the, doldrums, so, is, louis, leading, the, boxing, game, out, of, a, slump, likewise, biographer, bill, libby, asserted, that, the, sports, world, was, hungry, for, a, great, champion, when, louis, arrived, in, new, york, in, 1935, while, the, mainstream, press, was, beginning, to, embrace, louis, many, still, opposed, the, prospect, of, another, black, heavyweight, champion, in, september, 1935, on, the, eve, of, louis, s, fight, with, former, titleholder, max, baer, washington, post, sportswriter, shirley, povich, wrote, about, some, americans, hopes, for, the, white, contender, they, say, baer, will, surpass, himself, in, the, knowledge, that, he, is, the, lone, white, hope, for, the, defense, of, nordic, superiority, in, the, prize, ring, however, the, hopes, of, white, supremacists, would, soon, be, dashed, although, baer, had, been, knocked, down, only, once, before, in, his, professional, career, by, frankie, campbell, louis, dominated, the, former, champion, knocking, him, out, in, the, fourth, round, unknowingly, baer, suffered, from, a, unique, disadvantage, in, the, fight, earlier, that, evening, louis, had, married, marva, trotter, at, a, friend, s, apartment, and, was, eager, to, end, the, fight, in, order, to, consummate, the, relationship, later, that, year, louis, also, knocked, out, paulino, uzcudun, who, had, never, been, knocked, down, before, by, this, time, louis, was, ranked, as, the, no, 1, contender, in, the, heavyweight, division, and, had, won, the, associated, press, athlete, of, the, year, award, for, 1935, what, was, considered, to, be, a, final, tune, up, bout, before, an, eventual, title, shot, was, scheduled, for, june, 1936, against, max, schmeling, although, a, former, world, heavyweight, champion, schmeling, who, had, been, knocked, out, by, the, same, max, baer, louis, had, handily, beaten, was, not, considered, a, threat, to, louis, then, with, a, professional, record, of, 27, 0, schmeling, had, won, his, title, on, a, technicality, when, jack, sharkey, was, disqualified, after, giving, schmeling, a, low, blow, in, 1930, schmeling, was, also, 30, years, old, at, the, time, of, the, louis, bout, and, allegedly, past, his, prime, louis, s, training, retreat, was, located, at, lakewood, new, jersey, where, he, was, first, able, to, practice, the, game, of, golf, later, to, become, a, lifelong, passion, noted, entertainer, ed, sullivan, had, initially, sparked, louis, s, interest, in, the, sport, by, giving, an, instructional, book, to, joe, s, wife, marva, louis, spent, significant, time, on, the, golf, course, rather, than, training, for, the, match, conversely, schmeling, prepared, intently, for, the, bout, he, had, thoroughly, studied, louis, s, style, and, believed, he, had, found, a, weakness, by, exploiting, louis, s, habit, of, dropping, his, left, hand, after, a, jab, schmeling, handed, louis, his, first, professional, loss, by, knocking, him, out, in, round, 12, at, yankee, stadium, on, june, 19, 1936, the, event, would, lead, to, the, historic, rematch, of, the, two, in, one, of, the, world, s, most, famous, sporting, events, after, defeating, louis, schmeling, expected, a, title, shot, against, james, j, braddock, who, had, unexpectedly, defeated, max, baer, for, the, heavyweight, title, the, previous, june, madison, square, garden, msg, had, a, contract, with, braddock, for, the, title, defense, and, also, sought, a, braddock, schmeling, title, bout, but, jacobs, and, braddock, s, manager, joe, gould, had, been, planning, a, braddock, louis, matchup, for, months, schmeling, s, victory, gave, gould, tremendous, leverage, however, if, he, were, to, offer, schmeling, the, title, chance, instead, of, louis, there, was, a, very, real, possibility, that, nazi, authorities, would, never, allow, louis, a, shot, at, the, title, gould, s, demands, were, therefore, onerous, jacobs, would, have, to, pay, 10, of, all, future, boxing, promotion, profits, including, any, future, profits, from, louis, s, future, bouts, for, ten, years, braddock, and, gould, would, eventually, receive, more, than, 150, 000, from, this, arrangement, well, before, the, actual, fight, jacobs, and, gould, publicly, announced, that, their, fighters, would, fight, for, the, heavyweight, title, on, june, 22, 1937, figuring, that, the, new, york, state, athletic, commission, would, not, sanction, the, fight, in, deference, to, msg, and, schmeling, jacobs, scheduled, the, fight, for, chicago, each, of, the, parties, involved, worked, to, facilitate, the, controversial, braddock, louis, matchup, louis, did, his, part, by, knocking, out, former, champion, jack, sharkey, on, august, 18, 1936, meanwhile, gould, trumped, up, anti, nazi, sentiment, against, schmeling, and, jacobs, defended, a, lawsuit, by, msg, to, halt, the, braddock, louis, fight, a, federal, court, in, newark, new, jersey, eventually, ruled, that, braddock, s, contractual, obligation, to, stage, his, title, defense, at, msg, was, unenforceable, for, lack, of, mutual, consideration, the, stage, was, set, for, louis, s, title, shot, on, the, night, of, the, fight, june, 22, 1937, braddock, was, able, to, knock, louis, down, in, round, one, but, afterward, could, accomplish, little, after, inflicting, constant, punishment, louis, defeated, braddock, in, round, eight, knocking, him, out, cold, with, a, strong, right, hand, that, busted, james, teeth, through, his, gum, shield, and, lip, and, sent, him, to, the, ground, for, a, few, minutes, it, was, the, first, and, only, time, that, braddock, was, knocked, out, the, one, other, stoppage, of, braddock, s, career, was, a, tko, due, to, a, cut, louis, s, ascent, to, the, world, heavyweight, championship, was, complete, louis, s, victory, was, a, seminal, moment, in, african, american, history, thousands, of, african, americans, stayed, up, all, night, across, the, country, in, celebration, noted, author, and, member, of, the, harlem, renaissance, langston, hughes, described, louis, s, effect, in, these, terms, each, time, joe, louis, won, a, fight, in, those, depression, years, even, before, he, became, champion, thousands, of, black, americans, on, relief, or, w, p, a, and, poor, would, throng, out, into, the, streets, all, across, the, land, to, march, and, cheer, and, yell, and, cry, because, of, joe, s, one, man, triumphs, no, one, else, in, the, united, states, has, ever, had, such, an, effect, on, negro, emotions, or, on, mine, i, marched, and, cheered, and, yelled, and, cried, too, despite, his, championship, louis, was, haunted, by, the, earlier, defeat, to, schmeling, shortly, after, winning, the, title, he, was, quoted, as, saying, i, don, t, want, to, be, called, champ, until, i, whip, max, schmeling, louis, s, manager, mike, jacobs, attempted, to, arrange, a, rematch, in, 1937, but, negotiations, broke, down, when, schmeling, demanded, 30, of, the, gate, when, schmeling, instead, attempted, to, arrange, for, a, fight, against, british, empire, champion, tommy, farr, known, as, the, tonypandy, terror, ostensibly, for, a, world, championship, to, rival, the, claims, of, american, boxing, authorities, jacobs, outmaneuvered, him, offering, farr, a, guaranteed, 60, 000, to, fight, louis, instead, the, offer, was, too, lucrative, for, farr, to, turn, down, on, august, 30, 1937, after, a, postponement, of, four, days, due, to, rain, louis, and, farr, finally, touched, gloves, at, new, york, s, yankee, stadium, before, a, crowd, of, approximately, 32, 000, louis, fought, one, of, the, hardest, battles, of, his, life, the, bout, was, closely, contested, and, went, the, entire, 15, rounds, with, louis, being, unable, to, knock, farr, down, referee, arthur, donovan, was, even, seen, shaking, farr, s, hand, after, the, bout, in, apparent, congratulation, nevertheless, after, the, score, was, announced, louis, had, won, a, controversial, unanimous, decision, time, described, the, scene, thus, after, collecting, the, judges, votes, referee, arthur, donovan, announced, that, louis, had, won, the, fight, on, points, the, crowd, of, 50, 000, amazed, that, farr, had, not, been, knocked, out, or, even, knocked, down, booed, the, decision, it, seems, the, crowd, believed, that, referee, arthur, donovan, sr, had, raised, farr, s, glove, in, victory, seven, years, later, in, his, published, account, of, the, fight, donovan, spoke, of, the, mistake, that, may, have, led, to, this, confusion, he, wrote, as, tommy, walked, back, to, his, corner, after, shaking, louis, hand, i, followed, him, and, seized, his, glove, tommy, a, wonderful, perform, i, began, then, i, dropped, his, hand, like, a, red, hot, coal, he, had, started, to, raise, his, arm, he, thought, i, had, given, him, the, fight, and, the, world, championship, i, literally, ran, away, shaking, my, head, and, shouting, no, no, no, realising, how, i, had, raised, his, hopes, for, a, few, seconds, only, to, dash, them, to, the, ground, that, s, the, last, time, my, emotions, will, get, the, better, of, me, in, a, prize, fight, there, was, much, booing, at, the, announced, result, but, as, i, say, it, it, was, all, emotional, i, gave, tommy, two, rounds, and, one, even, and, both, his, winning, rounds, were, close, speaking, over, the, radio, after, the, fight, louis, admitted, that, he, had, been, hurt, twice, in, preparation, for, the, inevitable, rematch, with, schmeling, louis, tuned, up, with, bouts, against, nathan, mann, and, harry, thomas, the, rematch, between, louis, and, schmeling, would, become, one, of, the, most, famous, boxing, matches, of, all, time, and, is, remembered, as, one, of, the, major, sports, events, of, the, 20th, century, following, his, defeat, of, louis, in, 1936, schmeling, had, become, a, national, hero, in, germany, schmeling, s, victory, over, an, african, american, was, touted, by, nazi, officials, as, proof, of, their, doctrine, of, aryan, superiority, when, the, rematch, was, scheduled, louis, retreated, to, his, boxing, camp, in, new, jersey, and, trained, incessantly, for, the, fight, a, few, weeks, before, the, bout, louis, visited, the, white, house, where, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, told, him, joe, we, need, muscles, like, yours, to, beat, germany, louis, later, admitted, i, knew, i, had, to, get, schmeling, good, i, had, my, own, personal, reasons, and, the, whole, damned, country, was, depending, on, me, when, schmeling, arrived, in, new, york, city, in, june, 1938, for, the, rematch, he, was, accompanied, by, a, nazi, party, publicist, who, issued, statements, that, a, black, man, could, not, defeat, schmeling, and, that, when, schmeling, won, his, prize, money, would, be, used, to, build, tanks, in, germany, schmeling, s, hotel, was, picketed, by, anti, nazi, protesters, in, the, days, before, the, fight, on, the, night, of, june, 22, 1938, louis, and, schmeling, met, for, the, second, time, in, the, boxing, ring, the, fight, was, held, in, yankee, stadium, before, a, crowd, of, 70, 043, it, was, broadcast, by, radio, to, millions, of, listeners, throughout, the, world, including, 58, of, radio, equipped, u, s, households, with, radio, announcers, reporting, on, the, fight, in, english, german, spanish, and, portuguese, before, the, bout, schmeling, weighed, in, at, 193, pounds, louis, weighed, in, at, 198, pounds, the, fight, lasted, two, minutes, and, four, seconds, louis, battered, schmeling, with, a, series, of, swift, attacks, forcing, him, against, the, ropes, and, giving, him, a, paralyzing, body, blow, schmeling, afterward, claimed, it, was, an, illegal, kidney, punch, schmeling, was, knocked, down, three, times, and, only, managed, to, throw, two, punches, in, the, entire, bout, on, the, third, knockdown, schmeling, s, trainer, threw, in, the, towel, and, referee, arthur, donovan, stopped, the, fight, well, established, as, one, of, the, most, significant, boxing, matches, in, history, the, fight, has, been, widely, regarded, as, among, the, most, important, or, historic, sports, events, of, all, time, it, was, the, first, time, that, many, white, americans, openly, cheered, for, a, black, man, against, a, white, opponent, in, the, 29, months, from, january, 1939, through, may, 1941, louis, defended, his, title, thirteen, times, a, frequency, unmatched, by, any, heavyweight, champion, since, the, end, of, the, bare, knuckle, era, the, pace, of, his, title, defenses, combined, with, his, convincing, wins, earned, louis, s, opponents, from, this, era, the, collective, nickname, bum, of, the, month, club, notables, of, this, lambasted, pantheon, include, despite, its, derogatory, nickname, most, of, the, group, were, top, ten, heavyweights, of, the, 12, fighters, louis, faced, during, this, period, five, were, rated, by, the, ring, as, top, 10, heavyweights, in, the, year, they, fought, louis, galento, overall, 2, heavyweight, in, 1939, bob, pastor, 3, 1939, godoy, 3, 1940, simon, 6, 1941, and, baer, 8, 1941, four, others, musto, dorazio, burman, and, johnny, paychek, were, ranked, in, the, top, 10, in, a, different, year, louis, s, string, of, lightly, regarded, competition, ended, with, his, bout, against, billy, conn, the, light, heavyweight, champion, and, a, highly, regarded, contender, the, fighters, met, on, june, 18, 1941, in, front, of, a, crowd, of, 54, 487, fans, at, the, polo, grounds, in, new, york, city, the, fight, turned, out, to, be, what, is, commonly, considered, one, of, the, greatest, heavyweight, boxing, fights, of, all, time, conn, would, not, gain, weight, for, the, challenge, against, louis, saying, instead, that, he, would, rely, on, a, hit, and, run, strategy, this, prompted, louis, s, famous, response, he, can, run, but, he, can, t, hide, however, louis, had, clearly, underestimated, conn, s, threat, in, his, autobiography, joe, louis, said, i, made, a, mistake, going, into, that, fight, i, knew, conn, was, kinda, small, and, i, didn, t, want, them, to, say, in, the, papers, that, i, beat, up, on, some, little, guy, so, the, day, before, the, fight, i, did, a, little, roadwork, to, break, a, sweat, and, drank, as, little, water, as, possible, so, i, could, weigh, in, under, 200, pounds, chappie, was, as, mad, as, hell, but, conn, was, a, clever, fighter, he, was, like, a, mosquito, he, d, sting, and, move, conn, had, the, better, of, the, fight, through, 12, rounds, although, louis, was, able, to, stun, conn, with, a, left, hook, in, the, fifth, cutting, his, eye, and, nose, by, the, eighth, round, louis, began, suffering, from, dehydration, by, the, twelfth, round, louis, was, exhausted, with, conn, ahead, on, two, of, three, boxing, scorecards, but, against, the, advice, of, his, corner, conn, continued, to, closely, engage, louis, in, the, later, stages, of, the, fight, louis, made, the, most, of, the, opportunity, knocking, conn, out, with, two, seconds, left, in, the, thirteenth, round, the, contest, created, an, instant, rivalry, that, louis, s, career, had, lacked, since, the, schmeling, era, and, a, rematch, with, conn, was, planned, for, late, 1942, the, rematch, had, to, be, abruptly, canceled, however, after, conn, broke, his, hand, in, a, much, publicized, fight, with, his, father, in, law, major, league, ballplayer, jimmy, greenfield, smith, by, the, time, conn, was, ready, for, the, rematch, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, had, taken, place, louis, fought, a, charity, bout, for, the, navy, relief, society, against, his, former, opponent, buddy, baer, on, january, 9, 1942, which, raised, 47, 000, for, the, fund, the, next, day, he, volunteered, to, enlist, as, a, private, in, the, united, states, army, at, camp, upton, long, island, newsreel, cameras, recorded, his, induction, including, a, staged, scene, in, which, a, soldier, clerk, asked, what, s, your, occupation, to, which, louis, replied, fighting, and, let, us, at, them, japs, another, military, charity, bout, on, march, 27, 1942, against, another, former, opponent, abe, simon, netted, 36, 146, before, the, fight, louis, had, spoken, at, a, relief, fund, dinner, saying, of, the, war, effort, we, ll, win, cause, we, re, on, god, s, side, the, media, widely, reported, the, comment, instigating, a, surge, of, popularity, for, louis, slowly, the, press, began, to, eliminate, its, stereotypical, racial, references, when, covering, louis, and, instead, treated, him, as, a, sports, hero, despite, the, public, relations, boon, louis, s, charitable, fights, proved, financially, costly, although, he, saw, none, of, the, roughly, 90, 000, raised, by, these, and, other, charitable, fights, the, irs, later, credited, these, amounts, as, taxable, income, paid, to, louis, after, the, war, the, irs, pursued, the, issue, for, basic, training, louis, was, assigned, to, a, segregated, cavalry, unit, based, in, fort, riley, kansas, the, assignment, was, at, the, suggestion, of, his, friend, and, lawyer, truman, gibson, who, knew, of, louis, s, love, for, horsemanship, gibson, had, previously, become, a, civilian, advisor, to, the, war, department, in, charge, of, investigating, claims, of, harassment, against, black, soldiers, accordingly, louis, used, this, personal, connection, to, help, the, cause, of, various, black, soldiers, with, whom, he, came, into, contact, in, one, noted, episode, louis, contacted, gibson, in, order, to, facilitate, the, officer, candidate, school, ocs, applications, of, a, group, of, black, recruits, at, fort, riley, which, had, been, inexplicably, delayed, for, several, months, among, the, ocs, applications, louis, facilitated, was, that, of, young, ucla, athletic, legend, jackie, robinson, later, to, break, the, baseball, color, barrier, the, episode, spawned, a, personal, friendship, between, the, two, men, realizing, louis, s, potential, for, raising, esprit, de, corps, among, the, troops, the, army, placed, him, in, its, special, services, division, rather, than, sending, him, into, combat, louis, went, on, a, celebrity, tour, with, other, notables, including, fellow, boxer, sugar, ray, robinson, he, traveled, more, than, 35, 000, km, 22, 000, mi, and, staged, 96, boxing, exhibitions, before, two, million, soldiers, in, england, during, 1944, he, was, reported, to, have, signed, as, a, player, for, liverpool, football, club, as, a, publicity, stunt, in, addition, to, his, travels, louis, was, the, focus, of, a, media, recruitment, campaign, encouraging, african, american, men, to, enlist, in, the, armed, services, despite, the, military, s, racial, segregation, when, he, was, asked, about, his, decision, to, enter, the, racially, segregated, u, s, army, he, said, lots, of, things, wrong, with, america, but, hitler, ain, t, going, to, fix, them, in, 1943, louis, made, an, appearance, in, the, wartime, hollywood, musical, this, is, the, army, directed, by, michael, curtiz, he, appeared, as, himself, in, a, musical, number, the, well, dressed, man, in, harlem, which, emphasized, the, importance, of, african, american, soldiers, and, promoted, their, enlistment, louis, s, celebrity, power, was, not, directed, solely, toward, african, americans, in, a, famous, wartime, recruitment, slogan, he, echoed, his, prior, comments, of, 1942, we, ll, win, because, we, re, on, god, s, side, the, publicity, of, the, campaign, made, louis, widely, popular, stateside, even, outside, the, world, of, sports, never, before, had, white, americans, embraced, a, black, man, as, their, representative, to, the, world, although, louis, never, saw, combat, his, military, service, saw, challenges, of, its, own, during, his, travels, he, often, experienced, blatant, racism, on, one, occasion, a, military, policeman, mp, ordered, louis, and, ray, robinson, to, move, to, a, bench, in, the, rear, of, an, alabama, army, camp, bus, depot, we, ain, t, moving, said, louis, the, mp, tried, to, arrest, them, but, louis, forcefully, argued, the, pair, out, of, the, situation, in, another, incident, louis, exerted, his, influence, to, persuade, a, commanding, officer, to, drop, charges, against, now, lt, jackie, robinson, who, had, resisted, being, told, to, move, his, seat, on, a, southern, bus, and, retaliated, against, a, captain, who, had, called, robinson, a, nigger, louis, was, eventually, promoted, to, the, rank, of, technical, sergeant, on, april, 9, 1945, on, september, 23, of, the, same, year, he, was, awarded, the, legion, of, merit, a, military, decoration, rarely, awarded, to, enlisted, soldiers, for, incalculable, contribution, to, the, general, morale, receipt, of, the, honor, qualified, him, for, immediate, release, from, military, service, on, october, 1, 1945, louis, emerged, from, his, wartime, service, significantly, in, debt, in, addition, to, his, looming, tax, bill, which, had, not, been, finally, determined, at, the, time, but, was, estimated, at, greater, than, 100, 000, jacobs, claimed, that, louis, owed, him, 250, 000, despite, the, financial, pressure, on, louis, to, resume, boxing, his, long, awaited, rematch, against, billy, conn, had, to, be, postponed, to, the, summer, of, 1946, when, weather, conditions, could, accommodate, a, large, outdoor, audience, on, june, 19, a, disappointing, 40, 000, saw, the, rematch, at, yankee, stadium, in, which, louis, was, not, seriously, tested, conn, whose, skills, had, deteriorated, during, the, long, layoff, largely, avoided, contact, until, being, dispatched, by, knockout, in, the, eighth, round, although, the, attendance, did, not, meet, expectations, the, fight, was, still, the, most, profitable, of, louis, s, career, to, date, his, share, of, the, purse, was, 600, 000, of, which, louis, s, managers, got, 140, 000, his, ex, wife, 66, 000, and, the, u, s, state, of, new, york, 30, 000, after, trouble, finding, another, suitable, opponent, on, december, 5, 1947, louis, met, jersey, joe, walcott, a, 33, year, old, veteran, with, a, 44, 11, 2, record, walcott, entered, the, fight, as, a, 10, to, 1, underdog, nevertheless, walcott, knocked, down, louis, twice, in, the, first, four, rounds, most, observers, in, madison, square, garden, felt, walcott, dominated, the, 15, round, fight, when, louis, was, declared, the, winner, in, a, split, decision, the, crowd, booed, louis, was, under, no, illusion, about, the, state, of, his, boxing, skills, yet, he, was, too, embarrassed, to, quit, after, the, walcott, fight, determined, to, win, and, retire, with, his, title, intact, louis, signed, on, for, a, rematch, on, june, 25, 1948, about, 42, 000, people, came, to, yankee, stadium, to, see, the, aging, champion, who, weighed, 213, pounds, the, heaviest, of, his, career, to, date, walcott, knocked, louis, down, in, the, third, round, but, louis, survived, to, knock, out, walcott, in, the, eleventh, louis, would, not, defend, his, title, again, before, announcing, his, retirement, from, boxing, on, march, 1, 1949, in, his, bouts, with, conn, and, walcott, it, had, become, apparent, that, louis, was, no, longer, the, fighter, he, had, once, been, as, he, had, done, earlier, in, his, career, however, louis, would, continue, to, appear, in, numerous, exhibition, matches, worldwide, in, august, 1949, cab, calloway, rendered, homage, to, the, king, of, the, ring, with, his, song, ol, joe, louis, at, the, time, of, louis, s, initial, retirement, the, irs, was, still, completing, its, investigation, of, his, prior, tax, returns, which, had, always, been, handled, by, mike, jacobs, s, personal, accountant, in, may, 1950, the, irs, finished, a, full, audit, of, louis, s, past, returns, and, announced, that, with, interest, and, penalties, he, owed, the, government, more, than, 500, 000, louis, had, no, choice, but, to, return, to, the, ring, after, asking, gibson, to, take, over, his, personal, finances, and, switching, his, management, from, jacobs, and, roxborough, to, marshall, miles, the, louis, camp, negotiated, a, deal, with, the, irs, under, which, louis, would, come, out, of, retirement, with, all, louis, s, net, proceeds, going, to, the, irs, a, match, with, ezzard, charles, who, had, acquired, the, vacant, heavyweight, title, in, june, 1949, by, outpointing, walcott, was, set, for, september, 27, 1950, by, then, louis, was, 36, years, old, and, had, been, away, from, competitive, boxing, for, two, years, weighing, in, at, 218, pounds, louis, was, still, strong, but, his, reflexes, were, gone, and, charles, repeatedly, beat, him, to, the, punch, by, the, end, of, the, fight, louis, was, cut, above, both, eyes, one, of, which, was, shut, tight, by, swelling, he, knew, he, had, lost, even, before, charles, was, declared, the, winner, the, result, was, not, the, only, disappointing, aspect, of, the, fight, for, louis, only, 22, 357, spectators, paid, to, witness, the, event, at, yankee, stadium, and, his, share, of, the, purse, was, a, mere, 100, 458, louis, had, to, continue, fighting, after, facing, several, club, level, opponents, and, scoring, a, knockout, victory, over, ebu, heavyweight, champion, lee, savold, the, international, boxing, club, guaranteed, louis, 300, 000, to, face, undefeated, heavyweight, contender, rocky, marciano, on, october, 26, 1951, despite, his, being, a, 6, to, 5, favorite, few, boxing, insiders, believed, louis, had, a, chance, marciano, himself, was, reluctant, to, participate, in, the, bout, but, was, understanding, of, louis, s, position, this, is, the, last, guy, on, earth, i, want, to, fight, it, was, feared, particularly, among, those, who, had, witnessed, marciano, s, punching, power, first, hand, that, louis, s, unwillingness, to, quit, would, result, in, serious, injury, fighting, back, tears, ferdie, pacheco, said, in, the, sportscentury, documentary, about, louis, s, bout, with, marciano, he, wasn, t, just, going, to, lose, he, was, going, to, take, a, vicious, savage, beating, before, the, eyes, of, the, nation, joe, louis, an, american, hero, if, ever, there, was, one, was, going, to, get, beaten, up, louis, was, dropped, in, the, eighth, round, by, a, marciano, left, and, knocked, through, the, ropes, and, out, of, the, ring, less, than, thirty, seconds, later, in, the, dressing, room, after, the, fight, louis, s, army, touring, companion, sugar, ray, robinson, wept, marciano, also, attempted, to, console, louis, saying, i, m, sorry, joe, what, s, the, use, of, crying, louis, said, the, better, man, won, i, guess, everything, happens, for, the, best, after, facing, marciano, with, the, prospect, of, another, significant, payday, all, but, gone, louis, retired, for, good, from, professional, boxing, he, would, as, before, continue, to, tour, on, the, exhibition, circuit, with, his, last, contest, taking, place, on, december, 16, 1951, in, taipei, taiwan, against, corporal, buford, j, decordova, despite, louis, s, lucrative, purses, over, the, years, most, of, the, proceeds, went, to, his, handlers, of, the, over, 4, 6, million, earned, during, his, boxing, career, louis, himself, received, only, about, 800, 000, louis, was, nevertheless, extremely, generous, to, his, family, paying, for, homes, cars, and, education, for, his, parents, and, siblings, often, with, money, fronted, by, jacobs, he, invested, in, a, number, of, businesses, all, of, which, eventually, failed, including, the, joe, louis, restaurant, the, joe, louis, insurance, company, a, softball, team, called, the, brown, bombers, the, joe, louis, milk, company, joe, louis, pomade, hair, product, joe, louis, punch, a, drink, the, louis, rower, p, r, firm, a, horse, farm, and, the, rhumboogie, caf, in, chicago, he, gave, liberally, to, the, government, as, well, paying, back, the, city, of, detroit, for, any, welfare, money, his, family, had, received, a, combination, of, this, largesse, and, government, intervention, eventually, put, louis, in, severe, financial, straits, his, entrusting, of, his, finances, to, former, manager, mike, jacobs, haunted, him, after, the, 500, 000, irs, tax, bill, was, assessed, with, interest, accumulating, every, year, the, need, for, cash, precipitated, louis, s, post, retirement, comeback, even, though, his, comeback, earned, him, significant, purses, the, incremental, tax, rate, in, place, at, the, time, 90, meant, that, these, boxing, proceeds, did, not, even, keep, pace, with, interest, on, louis, s, tax, debt, as, a, result, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, he, owed, over, 1, million, in, taxes, and, interest, in, 1953, when, louis, s, mother, died, the, irs, appropriated, the, 667, she, had, willed, to, louis, to, bring, in, money, louis, engaged, in, numerous, activities, outside, the, ring, he, appeared, on, various, quiz, shows, and, an, old, army, friend, ash, resnick, gave, louis, a, job, greeting, tourists, to, the, caesars, palace, hotel, in, las, vegas, where, resnick, was, an, executive, for, income, louis, even, became, a, professional, wrestler, he, made, his, professional, wrestling, debut, on, march, 16, 1956, in, washington, d, c, at, the, uline, arena, defeating, cowboy, rocky, lee, after, defeating, lee, in, a, few, matches, louis, discovered, he, had, a, heart, ailment, and, retired, from, wrestling, competition, however, he, continued, as, a, wrestling, referee, until, 1972, louis, remained, a, popular, celebrity, in, his, twilight, years, his, friends, included, former, rival, max, schmeling, who, provided, louis, with, financial, assistance, during, his, retirement, and, mobster, frank, lucas, who, disgusted, with, the, government, s, treatment, of, louis, once, paid, off, a, 50, 000, tax, lien, held, against, him, these, payments, along, with, an, eventual, agreement, in, the, early, 1960s, by, the, irs, to, limit, its, collections, to, an, amount, based, on, louis, s, current, income, allowed, louis, to, live, comfortably, toward, the, end, of, his, life, after, the, louis, schmeling, fight, jack, dempsey, expressed, the, opinion, that, he, was, glad, he, never, had, to, face, joe, louis, in, the, ring, when, louis, fell, on, hard, financial, times, dempsey, served, as, honorary, chairman, of, a, fund, to, assist, louis, in, an, effort, to, improve, his, financial, situation, joe, louis, got, involved, with, professional, wrestling, in, 1954, his, first, recorded, match, was, on, august, 6, 1954, in, a, victory, over, bobby, nelson, in, 1956, louis, went, on, a, short, lived, wrestling, tour, arranged, by, promoter, ray, fabiani, this, was, cut, short, after, a, match, against, cowboy, rocky, lee, on, may, 31, 1956, when, louis, ribs, were, cracked, and, he, subsequently, lost, his, wrestling, license, louis, returned, to, the, wrestling, ring, on, march, 15, 1959, where, he, lost, to, buddy, rogers, in, columbus, ohio, this, led, to, a, hiatus, until, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, when, he, engaged, in, several, wrestling, matches, his, last, match, was, in, 1973, but, he, continued, as, a, referee, one, of, louis, other, passions, was, the, game, of, golf, in, which, he, also, played, a, historic, role, he, was, a, long, time, devotee, of, the, sport, since, being, introduced, to, the, game, before, the, first, schmeling, fight, in, 1936, in, 1952, louis, was, invited, to, play, as, an, amateur, in, the, san, diego, open, on, a, sponsor, s, exemption, which, was, announced, at, the, time, as, the, first, instance, of, an,

america, was, reluctant, to, allow, louis, to, enter, the, event, having, a, bylaw, at, the, time, limiting, pga, membership, to, white, americans, louis, s, celebrity, status, eventually, pushed, the, pga, toward, removing, the, bylaw, although, the, caucasian, only, clause, in, the, pga, of, america, s, constitution, was, not, formally, amended, until, november, 1961, the, change, however, paved, the, way, for, the, first, generation, of, african, american, professional, golfers, such, as, calvin, peete, two, weeks, after, the, 1952, san, diego, open, louis, was, invited, to, play, in,
