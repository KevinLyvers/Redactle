literary, will, on, april, 1, 1895, leaving, his, personal, papers, and, manuscripts, to, gonzalo, de, quesada, with, instructions, for, editing, knowing, that, the, majority, of, his, writing, in, newspapers, in, honduras, uruguay, and, chile, would, disappear, over, time, mart, instructed, quesada, to, arrange, his, papers, in, volumes, the, volumes, were, to, be, arranged, in, the, following, way, volumes, one, and, two, north, americas, volume, three, hispanic, americas, volume, four, north, american, scenes, volume, five, books, about, the, americas, this, included, both, north, and,

as, cuba, on, april, 11, once, there, they, made, contact, with, the, cuban, rebels, who, were, headed, by, the, maceo, brothers, and, started, fighting, against, spanish, troops, the, revolt, did, not, go, as, planned, mainly, because, the, call, to, revolution, received, no, immediate, spontaneous, support, from, the, masses, by, may, 13, the, expedition, reached, dos, rios, on, may, 19, gomez, faced, ximenez, de, sandoval, s, troops, and, ordered, mart, to, stay, with, the, rearguard, but, mart, became, separated, from, the, bulk, of, the, cuban, forces, and, entered, the, spanish, line, mart, was, killed, in, battle, against, spanish, troops, at, the, battle, of, dos, r, os, near, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, contramaestre, and, cauto, on, may, 19, 1895, g, mez, had, recognized, that, the, spaniards, had, a, strong, position, between, palm, trees, so, he, ordered, his, men, to, disengage, mart, was, alone, and, seeing, a, young, courier, ride, by, said, joven, a, la, carga, young, man, charge, this, was, around, midday, and, he, was, dressed, in, a, black, jacket, while, riding, a, white, horse, which, made, him, an, easy, target, for, the, spanish, after, mart, was, shot, the, young, trooper, ngel, de, la, guardia, lost, his, horse, and, returned, to, report, the, loss, the, spanish, took, possession, of, the, body, buried, it, close, by, then, exhumed, the, body, upon, realization, of, its, identity, he, was, buried, in, santa, ifigenia, cemetery, in, santiago, de, cuba, the, death, of, mart, was, a, blow, to, the, aspirations, of, the, cuban, rebels, inside, and, outside, of, the, island, but, the, fighting, continued, with, alternating, successes, and, failures, until, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, in, 1898, mart, s, political, ideas, were, shaped, by, his, early, encounter, with, krausist, liberalism, and, its, defense, of, spirituality, and, solidarity, radical, liberalism, in, latin, america, during, this, time, period, often, took, on, a, nationalist, and, anti, imperialist, cast, as, shown, by, the, examples, of, francisco, bilbao, in, chile, benito, ju, rez, in, mexico, jos, santos, zelaya, in, nicaragua, and, ram, n, emeterio, betances, in, puerto, rico, whom, mart, deeply, admired, and, considered, one, of, his, teachers, an, increasingly, radicalized, liberalism, emphasizing, democratic, participation, economic, equality, national, sovereignty, and, supplemented, by, his, exposure, to, doctrines, such, as, georgism, remained, the, dominant, basis, of, mart, s, outlook, mart, wrote, extensively, about, spanish, colonial, control, and, the, threat, of, us, expansionism, into, cuba, to, him, it, was, unnatural, that, cuba, was, controlled, and, oppressed, by, the, spanish, government, when, it, had, its, own, unique, identity, and, culture, in, his, pamphlet, from, february, 11, 1873, called, the, spanish, republic, and, the, cuban, revolution, he, argued, that, cubans, do, not, live, as, spaniards, live, they, are, nourished, by, a, different, system, of, trade, have, links, with, different, countries, and, express, their, happiness, through, quite, contrary, customs, there, are, no, common, aspirations, or, identical, goals, linking, the, two, peoples, or, beloved, memories, to, unite, them, peoples, are, only, united, by, ties, of, fraternity, and, love, mart, opposed, slavery, and, criticized, spain, for, upholding, it, in, a, speech, to, cuban, immigrants, in, steck, hall, new, york, on, january, 24, 1879, he, stated, that, the, war, against, spain, needed, to, be, fought, recalled, the, heroism, and, suffering, of, the, ten, years, war, which, he, declared, had, qualified, cuba, as, a, real, nation, with, a, right, to, independence, spain, had, not, ratified, the, conditions, of, the, peace, treaty, had, falsified, elections, continued, excessive, taxation, and, had, failed, to, abolish, slavery, cuba, needed, to, be, free, mart, proposed, in, a, letter, to, m, ximo, g, mez, in, 1882, the, formation, of, a, revolutionary, party, which, he, considered, essential, in, the, prevention, of, cuba, falling, back, on, the, home, rule, party, partido, autonomista, after, the, pact, of, zanj, n, the, home, rule, party, was, a, peace, seeking, party, that, would, stop, short, of, the, outright, independence, that, mart, thought, cuba, needed, but, he, was, aware, that, there, were, social, divisions, in, cuba, especially, racial, divisions, that, needed, to, be, addressed, as, well, he, thought, war, was, necessary, to, achieve, cuba, s, freedom, despite, his, basic, ideology, of, conciliation, respect, dignity, and, balance, the, establishment, of, the, patria, fatherland, with, a, good, government, would, unite, cubans, of, all, social, classes, and, colours, in, harmony, together, with, other, cubans, resident, in, new, york, mart, started, laying, the, grounds, for, the, revolutionary, party, stressing, the, need, for, a, democratic, organization, as, the, basic, structure, before, any, military, leaders, were, to, join, the, military, would, have, to, subordinate, themselves, to, the, interests, of, the, fatherland, g, mez, later, rejoined, mart, s, plans, promising, to, comply, mart, s, consolidation, of, support, among, the, cuban, expatriates, especially, in, florida, was, key, in, the, planning, and, execution, of, the, invasion, of, cuba, his, speeches, to, cuban, tobacco, workers, in, tampa, and, key, west, motivated, and, united, them, this, is, considered, the, most, important, political, achievement, of, his, life, at, this, point, he, refined, his, ideological, platform, basing, it, on, a, cuba, held, together, by, pride, in, being, cuban, a, society, that, ensured, the, welfare, and, prosperity, of, all, cubans, independently, of, class, occupation, or, race, faith, in, the, cause, could, not, die, and, the, military, would, not, try, for, domination, all, pro, independence, cubans, would, participate, with, no, sector, predominating, from, this, he, established, the, cuban, revolutionary, party, in, early, 1892, mart, and, the, crp, were, devoted, to, secretly, organizing, the, anti, spanish, war, mart, s, newspaper, patria, was, a, key, instrument, of, this, campaign, where, mart, delineated, his, final, plans, for, cuba, through, this, medium, he, argued, against, the, exploitative, colonialism, of, spain, in, cuba, criticized, the, home, rule, autonomista, party, for, having, aims, that, fell, considerably, short, of, full, independence, and, warned, against, u, s, annexationism, which, he, felt, could, only, be, prevented, by, cuba, s, successful, independence, he, specified, his, plans, for, the, future, cuban, republic, a, multi, class, and, multi, racial, democratic, republic, based, on, universal, suffrage, with, an, egalitarian, economic, base, to, develop, fully, cuba, s, productive, resources, and, an, equitable, distribution, of, land, among, citizens, with, enlightened, and, virtuous, politicians, from, mart, s, campaign, diaries, written, during, the, final, expedition, in, cuba, it, seems, evident, that, mart, would, have, reached, the, highest, position, in, the, future, republic, of, arms, this, was, not, to, be, his, death, occurred, before, the, assembly, of, cuba, was, set, up, until, his, last, minute, mart, dedicated, his, life, to, achieve, full, independence, for, cuba, his, uncompromising, belief, in, democracy, and, freedom, for, his, fatherland, is, what, characterized, his, political, ideology, mart, demonstrated, an, anti, imperialist, attitude, from, an, early, age, and, was, convinced, that, the, united, states, posed, a, danger, for, latin, america, while, critiquing, the, united, states, for, its, stereotypes, of, latin, americans, and, preoccupation, with, capitalism, mart, also, drew, parallels, with, the, american, revolution, and, the, nationalist, movement, in, cuba, at, the, same, time, he, recognized, the, advantages, of, the, civilizations, of, western, europe, and, the, united, states, which, were, open, to, the, reforms, that, latin, american, countries, needed, in, order, to, detach, themselves, from, the, colonial, heritage, of, spain, mart, s, distrust, of, u, s, politics, had, developed, during, the, 1880s, due, to, the, intervention, threats, that, loomed, on, mexico, and, guatemala, and, indirectly, on, cuba, s, future, over, time, mart, became, increasingly, alarmed, about, the, united, states, intentions, for, cuba, the, united, states, desperately, needed, new, markets, for, its, industrial, products, because, of, the, economic, crisis, it, was, experiencing, and, the, media, was, talking, about, the, purchase, of, cuba, from, spain, cuba, was, a, profitable, fertile, country, with, an, important, strategic, position, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, mart, felt, that, the, interests, of, cuba, s, future, lay, with, its, sister, nations, in, latin, america, and, were, opposite, to, those, of, the, united, states, another, trait, that, mart, admired, was, the, work, ethic, that, characterized, u, s, society, on, various, occasions, mart, conveyed, his, deep, admiration, for, the, immigrant, based, society, whose, principal, aspiration, he, interpreted, as, being, to, construct, a, truly, modern, country, based, upon, hard, work, and, progressive, ideas, mart, stated, that, he, was, never, surprised, in, any, country, of, the, world, visited, here, was, surprised, remarked, that, no, one, stood, quietly, on, the, corners, no, door, was, shut, an, instant, no, man, was, quiet, stopped, self, looked, respectfully, on, this, people, and, said, goodbye, forever, to, that, lazy, life, and, poetical, inutility, of, our, european, countries, although, mart, opposed, us, intervention, in, cuba, he, found, american, society, to, be, so, great, that, he, believed, latin, america, should, consider, imitating, the, united, states, mart, argued, that, if, the, us, could, reach, such, a, high, standard, of, living, in, so, short, a, time, and, despite, too, its, lack, of, unifying, traditions, could, not, the, same, be, expected, of, latin, america, however, mart, believed, us, expansionism, represented, spanish, american, republics, greatest, danger, mart, was, amazed, at, how, education, was, directed, towards, helping, the, development, of, the, nation, and, once, again, encouraged, latin, american, countries, to, follow, the, example, set, by, u, s, society, at, the, same, time, he, criticized, the, elitist, educational, systems, of, cuba, and, the, rest, of, latin, america, often, mart, recommended, countries, in, latin, america, to, send, representatives, to, learn, more, relevant, techniques, in, the, united, states, once, this, was, done, mart, hoped, that, this, representatives, would, bring, a, much, needed, modernization, to, the, latin, american, agricultural, policies, however, not, everything, in, the, united, states, was, to, be, admired, by, mart, when, it, came, to, politics, mart, wrote, that, politics, in, the, us, had, adopted, a, carnival, atmosphere, especially, during, election, time, he, saw, acts, of, corruption, among, candidates, such, as, bribing, the, constituents, with, vast, quantities, of, beer, while, impressive, parades, wound, their, way, through, new, york, s, crowded, streets, past, masses, of, billboards, all, exhorting, the, public, to, vote, for, the, different, political, candidates, mart, criticized, and, condemned, the, elites, of, the, united, states, as, they, pulled, the, main, political, strings, behind, the, scenes, according, to, mart, the, elites, deserved, severe, censure, as, they, were, the, biggest, threat, to, the, ideals, with, which, the, united, states, was, first, conceived, mart, started, to, believe, that, the, us, had, abused, its, potential, racism, was, abundant, different, races, were, being, discriminated, against, political, life, was, both, cynically, regarded, by, the, public, at, large, and, widely, abused, by, professional, politicians, industrial, magnates, and, powerful, labor, groups, faced, each, other, menacingly, all, of, this, convinced, mart, that, a, large, scale, social, conflict, was, imminent, in, the, united, states, on, the, positive, side, mart, was, astonished, by, the, inviolable, right, of, freedom, of, speech, which, all, u, s, citizens, possessed, mart, applauded, the, united, states, constitution, which, allowed, freedom, of, speech, to, all, its, citizens, no, matter, what, political, beliefs, they, had, in, may, 1883, while, attending, political, meetings, he, heard, the, call, for, revolution, and, more, specifically, the, destruction, of, the, capitalist, system, mart, was, amazed, that, the, country, maintained, freedom, of, speech, even, with, respect, to, calls, that, could, have, led, to, its, own, destruction, mart, also, gave, his, support, to, the, women, s, suffrage, movements, and, was, pleased, that, women, here, advantage, of, this, privilege, in, order, to, make, their, voices, heard, according, to, mart, free, speech, was, essential, if, any, nation, was, to, be, civilized, and, he, expressed, his, profound, admiration, for, these, many, basic, liberties, and, opportunities, open, to, the, vast, majority, of, u, s, citizens, the, works, of, mart, contain, many, comparisons, between, the, ways, of, life, of, north, and, latin, america, the, former, was, seen, as, hardy, soulless, and, at, times, cruel, society, but, one, which, nevertheless, had, been, based, upon, a, firm, foundation, of, liberty, and, on, a, tradition, of, liberty, although, u, s, society, had, its, flaws, they, tended, to, be, of, minor, importance, when, compared, to, the, broad, sweep, of, social, inequality, and, to, the, widespread, abuse, of, power, prevalent, in, latin, america, once, it, became, apparent, that, the, united, states, were, actually, going, to, purchase, cuba, and, intended, to, americanize, it, mart, spoke, out, loudly, and, bravely, against, such, action, stating, the, opinion, of, many, cubans, on, the, united, states, of, america, jos, mart, as, a, liberator, believed, that, the, latin, american, countries, needed, to, know, the, reality, of, their, own, history, mart, also, saw, the, necessity, of, a, country, having, its, own, literature, these, reflections, started, in, mexico, from, 1875, and, are, connected, to, the, mexican, reform, where, prominent, liberals, like, ignacio, manuel, altamirano, and, guillermo, prieto, had, situated, themselves, in, front, of, a, cultural, renovation, in, mexico, taking, on, the, same, approach, as, esteban, echeverr, a, thirty, years, before, in, argentina, in, the, second, boletin, that, mart, published, in, the, revista, universal, may, 11, 1875, one, can, already, see, mart, s, approach, which, was, fundamentally, latin, american, his, wish, to, build, a, national, or, latin, american, identity, was, nothing, new, or, unusual, in, those, days, however, no, latin, american, intellectual, of, that, time, had, approached, as, clearly, as, mart, the, task, of, building, a, national, identity, he, insisted, on, the, necessity, of, building, institutions, and, laws, that, matched, the, natural, elements, of, each, country, and, recalled, the, failure, of, the, applications, of, french, and, american, civil, codes, in, the, new, latin, american, republics, mart, believed, that, el, hombre, del, sur, the, man, of, the, south, should, choose, an, appropriate, development, strategy, matching, his, character, the, peculiarity, of, his, culture, and, history, and, the, nature, that, determined, his, being, mart, as, a, writer, covered, a, range, of, genres, in, addition, to, producing, newspaper, articles, and, keeping, up, an, extensive, correspondence, his, letters, are, included, in, the, collection, of, his, complete, works, he, wrote, a, serialized, novel, composed, poetry, wrote, essays, and, published, four, issues, of, a, children, s, magazine, la, edad, de, oro, the, golden, age, 1889, his, essays, and, articles, occupy, more, than, fifty, volumes, of, his, complete, works, his, prose, was, extensively, read, and, influenced, the, modernist, generation, especially, the, nicaraguan, poet, rub, n, dar, o, whom, mart, called, my, son, when, they, met, in, new, york, in, 1893, mart, did, not, publish, any, books, only, two, notebooks, cuadernos, of, verses, in, editions, outside, of, the, market, and, a, number, of, political, tracts, the, rest, an, enormous, amount, was, left, dispersed, in, numerous, newspapers, and, magazines, in, letters, in, diaries, and, personal, notes, in, other, unedited, texts, in, frequently, improvised, speeches, and, some, lost, forever, five, years, after, his, death, the, first, volume, of, his, obras, was, published, a, novel, appeared, in, this, collection, in, 1911, amistad, funesta, which, mart, had, made, known, was, published, under, a, pseudonym, in, 1885, in, 1913, also, in, this, edition, his, third, poetic, collection, that, he, had, kept, unedited, versos, libres, his, diario, de, campa, a, campaign, diary, was, published, in, 1941, later, still, in, 1980, nicaraguan, poet, ernesto, mej, a, s, nchez, produced, a, set, of, about, thirty, of, mart, s, articles, written, for, the, mexican, newspaper, el, partido, liberal, that, weren, t, included, in, any, of, his, so, called, obras, completas, editions, from, 1882, to, 1891, mart, collaborated, in, la, naci, n, a, buenos, aires, newspaper, his, texts, from, la, naci, n, have, been, collected, in, anuario, del, centro, de, estudios, mart, anos, over, the, course, of, his, journalistic, career, he, wrote, for, numerous, newspapers, starting, with, el, diablo, cojuelo, the, limping, devil, and, la, patria, libre, the, free, fatherland, both, of, which, he, helped, to, found, in, 1869, in, cuba, and, which, established, the, extent, of, his, political, commitment, and, vision, for, cuba, in, spain, he, wrote, for, la, colonia, espa, ola, in, mexico, for, la, revista, universal, and, in, venezuela, for, revista, venezolana, which, he, founded, in, new, york, he, contributed, to, venezuelan, periodical, la, opini, n, nacional, buenos, aires, newspaper, la, naci, n, mexico, s, la, opinion, liberal, and, the, hour, from, the, u, s, the, first, critical, edition, of, mart, s, complete, works, began, to, appear, in, 1983, in, jos, mart, obras, completas, edici, n, cr, tica, the, critical, edition, of, his, complete, poems, was, published, in, 1985, in, jos, mart, poes, a, completa, edici, n, critica, volume, two, of, his, obras, completas, includes, his, famous, essay, nuestra, america, which, comprises, a, variety, of, subjects, relating, to, spanish, america, about, which, mart, studied, and, wrote, here, it, is, noted, that, after, cuba, his, interest, was, directed, mostly, to, guatemala, mexico, and, venezuela, the, various, sections, of, this, part, are, about, general, matters, and, international, conferences, economic, social, and, political, questions, literature, and, art, agrarian, and, industrial, problems, immigration, education, relations, with, the, united, states, and, spanish, america, travel, notes, according, to, mart, the, intention, behind, the, publication, of, la, edad, de, oro, was, so, that, american, children, may, know, how, people, used, to, live, and, how, they, live, nowadays, in, the, united, states, and, in, other, countries, how, many, things, are, made, such, as, glass, and, iron, steam, engines, and, suspension, bridges, and, electric, light, so, that, when, a, child, sees, a, coloured, stone, he, will, know, why, the, stone, is, coloured, we, shall, tell, them, about, everything, which, is, done, in, factories, where, things, happen, which, are, stranger, and, more, interesting, than, the, magic, in, fairy, stories, these, things, are, real, magic, more, marvelous, than, any, we, write, for, children, because, it, is, they, who, know, how, to, love, because, it, is, children, who, are, the, hope, for, the, world, mart, s, versos, sencillos, was, written, in, the, town, of, haines, falls, new, york, where, his, doctor, has, sent, to, regain, his, strength, where, streams, flowed, and, clouds, gathered, in, upon, themeselves, the, poetry, encountered, in, this, work, is, in, many, autobiographical, and, allows, readers, to, see, mart, the, man, and, the, patriot, and, to, judge, what, was, important, to, him, at, a, crucial, time, in, cuban, history, mart, s, writings, reflected, his, own, views, both, socially, and, politically, cultivo, una, rosa, blanca, is, one, of, his, poems, that, emphasize, his, views, in, hopes, of, betterment, for, society, i, cultivate, a, white, rose, in, july, as, in, january, for, the, sincere, friend, who, gives, me, his, hand, frankly, and, for, the, cruel, person, who, tears, out, the, heart, with, which, i, live, i, cultivate, neither, nettles, nor, thorns, i, cultivate, a, white, rose, this, poem, is, a, clear, description, of, mart, s, societal, hopes, for, his, homeland, within, the, poem, he, talks, about, how, regardless, of, the, person, whether, kind, or, cruel, he, cultivates, a, white, rose, meaning, that, he, remains, peaceful, this, coincides, with, his, ideology, about, establishing, unity, amongst, the, people, more, so, those, of, cuba, through, a, common, identity, with, no, regards, to, ethnic, and, racial, differences, this, doctrine, could, be, accomplished, if, one, treated, his, enemy, with, peace, as, he, would, treat, a, friend, the, kindness, of, one, person, should, be, shared, with, all, people, regardless, of, personal, conflict, by, following, the, moral, that, lies, within, cultivo, rosa, blanca, mart, s, vision, of, cuban, solidarity, could, be, possible, creating, a, more, peaceful, society, that, would, emanate, through, future, generations, after, his, breakthrough, in, cuba, literature, jos, mart, went, on, to, contribute, his, works, to, newspapers, magazines, and, books, that, reflected, his, political, and, social, views, because, of, his, early, death, mart, was, unable, to, publish, a, vast, collection, of, poetry, even, so, his, literary, contributions, have, made, him, a, renowned, figure, in, literature, influencing, many, writers, and, people, in, general, to, aspire, to, follow, in, the, footsteps, of, mart, mart, s, style, of, writing, is, difficult, to, categorize, he, used, many, aphorisms, short, memorable, lines, that, convey, truth, and, or, wisdom, and, long, complex, sentences, he, is, considered, a, major, contributor, to, the, spanish, american, literary, movement, known, as, modernismo, and, has, been, linked, to, latin, american, consciousness, of, the, modern, age, and, modernity, his, chronicles, combined, elements, of, literary, portraiture, dramatic, narration, and, a, dioramic, scope, his, poetry, contained, fresh, and, astonishing, images, along, with, deceptively, simple, sentiments, as, an, orator, for, he, made, many, speeches, he, was, known, for, his, cascading, structure, powerful, aphorisms, and, detailed, descriptions, more, important, than, his, style, is, how, he, uses, that, style, to, put, into, service, his, ideas, making, advanced, convincing, notions, throughout, his, writing, he, made, reference, to, historical, figures, and, events, and, used, constant, allusions, to, literature, current, news, and, cultural, matters, for, this, reason, he, may, be, difficult, to, read, and, translate, his, didactic, spirit, encouraged, him, to, establish, a, magazine, for, children, la, edad, de, oro, 1889, which, contained, a, short, essay, titled, tres, heroes, three, heroes, representative, of, his, talent, to, adapt, his, expression, to, his, audience, in, this, case, to, make, the, young, reader, conscious, of, and, amazed, by, the, extraordinary, bravery, of, the, three, men, bolivar, hidalgo, and, san, mart, n, this, is, his, style, to, teach, delightfully, jos, mart, is, universally, honored, as, a, great, poet, patriot, and, martyr, of, cuban, independence, but, he, was, also, a, translator, of, some, note, although, he, translated, literary, material, for, the, sheer, joy, of, it, much, of, the, translating, he, did, was, imposed, on, him, by, economic, necessity, during, his, many, years, of, exile, in, the, united, states, mart, learned, english, at, an, early, age, and, had, begun, to, translate, at, thirteen, he, continued, translating, for, the, rest, of, his, life, including, his, time, as, a, student, in, spain, although, the, period, of, his, greatest, productivity, was, during, his, stay, in, new, york, from, 1880, until, he, returned, to, cuba, in, 1895, in, new, york, he, was, what, is, known, today, as, a, freelancer, as, well, as, an, in, house, translator, he, translated, several, books, for, the, publishing, house, of, d, appleton, and, did, a, series, of, translations, for, newspapers, as, a, revolutionary, activist, in, cuba, s, long, struggle, for, independence, he, translated, into, english, a, number, of, articles, and, pamphlets, supporting, that, movement, in, addition, to, fluent, english, mart, also, spoke, french, italian, latin, and, classical, greek, fluently, the, latter, learned, so, he, could, read, the, greek, classical, works, in, the, original, there, was, clearly, a, dichotomy, in, mart, s, feeling, about, the, kind, of, work, he, was, translating, like, many, professionals, he, undertook, for, money, translation, tasks, which, had, little, intellectual, or, emotional, appeal, for, him, although, mart, never, presented, a, systematic, theory, of, translation, nor, did, he, write, extensively, about, his, approach, to, translation, he, did, jot, down, occasional, thoughts, on, the, subject, showcasing, his, awareness, of, the, translator, s, dilemma, of, the, faithful, versus, the, beautiful, and, stating, that, translation, should, be, natural, so, that, it, appears, that, the, book, were, written, in, the, language, to, which, it, has, been, translated, modernists, in, general, use, a, subjective, language, mart, s, stylistic, creed, is, part, of, the, necessity, to, de, codify, the, logic, rigor, and, the, linguistic, construction, and, to, eliminate, the, intellectual, abstract, and, systematic, expression, there, is, the, deliberate, intention, and, awareness, to, expand, the, expressive, system, of, the, language, the, style, changes, the, form, of, thinking, without, falling, into, unilateralism, mart, values, the, expression, because, language, is, an, impression, and, a, feeling, through, the, form, modernism, mostly, searches, for, visions, and, realities, the, expression, takes, in, the, impressions, the, state, of, mind, without, reflection, and, without, concept, this, is, the, law, of, subjectivity, we, can, see, this, in, works, of, mart, one, of, the, first, modernists, who, conceives, the, literary, task, like, an, invisible, unity, an, expressive, totality, considering, the, style, like, a, form, of, the, content, forma, del, contenido, the, difference, that, mart, established, between, prose, and, poetry, are, conceptual, poetry, as, he, believes, is, a, language, of, the, permanent, subjective, the, intuition, and, the, vision, the, prose, is, an, instrument, and, a, method, of, spreading, the, ideas, and, has, the, goal, of, elevating, encouraging, and, animating, these, ideas, rather, than, having, the, expression, of, tearing, up, the, heart, complaining, and, moaning, the, prose, is, a, service, to, his, people, mart, produces, a, system, of, specific, signs, an, ideological, code, c, digo, ideol, gico, these, symbols, claim, their, moral, value, and, construct, signs, of, ethic, conduct, mart, s, modernism, was, a, spiritual, attitude, that, was, reflected, on, the, language, all, his, writing, defines, his, moral, world, one, could, also, say, that, his, ideological, and, spiritual, sphere, is, fortified, in, his, writing, the, difference, between, mart, and, other, modernist, initiators, such, as, manuel, guti, rrez, n, jera, juli, n, del, casal, and, jos, asunci, n, silva, and, the, similarity, between, him, and, manuel, gonz, lez, prada, lies, in, the, profound, and, transcendent, value, that, he, gave, to, literature, converting, prose, into, an, article, or, the, work, of, a, journalist, this, hard, work, was, important, in, giving, literature, authentic, and, independent, value, and, distancing, it, from, mere, formal, amusement, manuel, guti, rrez, n, jera, rub, n, dar, o, miguel, de, unamuno, and, jos, enrique, rod, saved, the, mart, nian, articles, which, will, have, an, endless, value, in, the, writings, of, the, american, continent, apart, from, mart, nian, articles, essay, writing, and, literature, starts, to, authorize, itself, as, an, alternative, and, privileged, way, to, talk, about, politics, literature, starts, to, apply, itself, the, only, hermeneutics, able, to, resolve, the, enigmas, of, a, latin, american, identity, mart, s, dedication, to, the, cause, of, cuban, independence, and, his, passionate, belief, in, democracy, and, justice, has, made, him, a, hero, for, all, cubans, a, symbol, of, unity, the, apostle, a, great, leader, his, writings, have, created, a, platform, for, all, that, he, went, through, during, the, duration, of, this, period, in, time, his, ultimate, goal, of, building, a, democratic, just, and, stable, republic, in, cuba, and, his, obsession, with, the, practical, execution, of, this, goal, led, him, to, become, the, most, charismatic, leader, of, the, 1895, colonial, revolution, his, work, haranguing, the, cuban, community, raising, funds, resolving, the, disagreements, of, important, revolutionary, leaders, and, creating, the, cuban, revolutionary, party, to, organize, this, effort, put, into, motion, the, cuban, war, of, independence, his, foresight, into, the, future, shown, in, his, warnings, against, american, political, interests, for, cuba, was, confirmed, by, the, swift, occupation, of, cuba, by, the, united, states, following, the, spanish, american, war, his, belief, in, the, inseparability, of, cuban, and, latin, american, sovereignty, and, the, expression, thereof, in, his, writings, have, contributed, to, the, shape, of, the, modern, latin, american, identity, through, his, beliefs, for, cuban, and, latin, american, sovereignty, cuba, revolted, on, former, allies, this, is, why, cuba, became, an, independent, nation, his, works, are, a, cornerstone, of, latin, american, and, political, literature, and, his, prolific, contributions, to, the, fields, of, journalism, poetry, and, prose, are, highly, acclaimed, mart, was, a, classical, liberal, whose, major, goal, was, the, liberation, of, cuba, from, spain, and, the, establishment, of, a, democratic, republican, government, his, writings, on, the, concepts, of, cuban, nationalism, fuelled, the, 1895, revolution, and, have, continued, to, inform, conflicting, visions, of, the, cuban, nation, due, to, the, great, admiration, of, the, cuban, people, for, mart, the, communist, government, and, castro, himself, have, tried, to, associate, themselves, with, mart, as, much, as, possible, endorsing, his, anti, imperialist, positions, and, downplaying, his, views, that, conflict, with, cuban, communist, doctrine, despite, mart, never, having, supported, communism, or, single, party, systems, cuban, leaders, repeatedly, cited, mart, as, an, inspiration, and, claimed, that, mart, s, partido, revolucionario, cubano, was, a, forerunner, of, the, communist, party, a, clear, example, of, this, forced, association, is, that, following, his, death, in, 2016, former, cuban, leader, fidel, castro, was, buried, next, to, mart, in, santiago, regarded, as, cuba, s, martyr, and, apostle, several, landmarks, in, cuba, are, dedicated, to, mart, during, castro, s, tenure, the, politics, and, death, of, mart, were, used, to, justify, certain, actions, of, the, state, the, cuban, government, claimed, that, mart, had, supported, a, single, party, system, creating, a, precedent, for, a, communist, government, however, such, claims, are, due, more, to, the, communist, administration, s, desire, to, justify, its, actions, by, attributing, them, to, the, thinking, of, the, national, hero, than, to, concrete, evidence, there, is, no, proof, that, mart, wanted, a, one, party, system, for, cuba, on, the, contrary, he, was, an, admirer, of, democracy, and, the, american, republican, system, and, throughout, his, life, he, fiercely, criticized, any, type, of, dictatorial, government, in, addition, he, also, criticized, marx, and, warned, on, several, occasions, about, the, dangers, of, socialism, mart, s, nuanced, often, ambivalent, positions, on, the, most, important, issues, of, his, day, have, led, marxist, interpreters, to, see, a, class, conflict, between, the, proletariat, and, the, bourgeoisie, as, the, main, theme, of, his, works, while, others, have, identified, a, liberal, capitalist, emphasis, cubans, who, oppose, the, communist, government, honor, mart, as, a, defender, of, freedom, and, democracy, and, a, figure, of, hope, for, the, cuban, nation, and, condemn, castro, s, government, for, manipulating, his, works, and, creating, a, castroite, mart, to, justify, its, intolerance, and, abridgments, of, human, rights, his, writings, thus, remain, a, key, ideological, weapon, in, the, battle, over, the, fate, of, the, cuban, nation, jos, mart, international, airport, havana, s, international, airport, is, named, after, mart, a, statue, of, mart,
