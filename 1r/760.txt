of, the, age, of, enlightenment, spinoza, significantly, influenced, modern, biblical, criticism, 17th, century, rationalism, and, dutch, intellectual, culture, establishing, himself, as, one, of, the, most, important, and, radical, philosophers, of, the, early, modern, period, influenced, by, stoicism, thomas, hobbes, ren, descartes, ibn, tufayl, and, heterodox, christians, spinoza, was, a,

challenged, rabbinic, authority, and, questioned, jewish, doctrines, leading, to, his, permanent, expulsion, from, the, jewish, community, in, 1656, following, his, excommunication, he, distanced, himself, from, all, religious, affiliations, and, devoted, himself, to, philosophical, inquiry, and, lens, grinding, spinoza, attracted, a, dedicated, circle, of, followers, who, gathered, to, discuss, his, writings, and, joined, him, in, the, intellectual, pursuit, of, truth, spinoza, published, little, to, avoid, persecution, and, bans, on, his, books, in, his, tractatus, theologico, politicus, described, by, steven, nadler, as, one, of, the, most, important, books, of, western, thought, spinoza, questioned, the, divine, origin, of, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, nature, of, god, while, arguing, that, ecclesiastic, authority, should, have, no, role, in, a, secular, democratic, state, ethics, argues, for, a, pantheistic, view, of, god, and, explores, the, place, of, human, freedom, in, a, world, devoid, of, theological, cosmological, and, political, moorings, rejecting, messianism, and, the, emphasis, on, the, afterlife, spinoza, emphasized, appreciating, and, valuing, life, for, oneself, and, others, by, advocating, for, individual, liberty, in, its, moral, psychological, and, metaphysical, dimensions, spinoza, helped, establish, the, genre, of, political, writing, called, secular, theology, spinoza, s, philosophy, spans, nearly, every, area, of, philosophical, discourse, including, metaphysics, epistemology, political, philosophy, ethics, philosophy, of, mind, and, philosophy, of, science, his, friends, posthumously, published, his, works, captivating, philosophers, for, the, next, two, centuries, celebrated, as, one, of, the, most, original, and, influential, thinkers, of, the, seventeenth, century, rebecca, goldstein, dubbed, him, the, renegade, jew, who, gave, us, modernity, spinoza, s, ancestors, adherents, of, crypto, judaism, faced, persecution, during, the, portuguese, inquisition, enduring, torture, and, public, displays, of, humiliation, in, 1597, his, paternal, grandfather, s, family, left, vidigueira, for, nantes, and,

grandfather, was, a, foremost, merchant, who, drifted, between, judaism, and, christianity, spinoza, was, raised, by, his, grandmother, from, ages, six, to, nine, and, probably, learned, much, about, his, family, history, from, her, spinoza, s, father, michael, was, a, prominent, and, wealthy, merchant, in, amsterdam, with, a, business, that, had, wide, geographical, reach, in, 1649, he, was, elected, to, serve, as, an, administrative, officer, of, the, recently, united, congregation, talmud, torah, he, married, his, cousin, rachael, d, espinosa, daughter, of, his, uncle, abraham, d, espinosa, who, was, also, a, community, leader, and, michael, s, business, partner, marrying, cousins, was, common, in, the, portuguese, jewish, community, then, giving, michael, access, to, his,

he, had, five, children, his, second, wife, brought, a, dowry, to, the, marriage, that, was, absorbed, into, michael, s, business, capital, instead, of, being, set, aside, for, her, children, which, may, have, caused, a, grudge, between, spinoza, and, his, father, the, family, lived, on, the, artificial, island, on, the, south, side, of, the, river, amstel, known, as, the, vlooienburg, at, the, fifth, house, along, the, houtgracht, canal, the, jewish, quarter, was, not, formally, divided, the, family, lived, close, to, the, bet, ya, acov, synagogue, and, nearby, were, christians, including, the, artist, rembrandt, miriam, was, their, first, child, followed, by, isaac, who, was, expected, to, take, over, as, head, of, the, family, and, the, commercial, enterprise, but, died, in, 1649,

followed, by, another, sister, rebecca, miriam, married, samuel, de, caceres, but, died, shortly, after, childbirth, according, to, jewish, practice, samuel, had, to, marry, his, former, sister, in,

deborah, died, when, spinoza, was, six, years, old, michael, s, third, wife, esther, raised, spinoza, from, age, nine, she, lacked, formal, jewish, knowledge, due, to, growing, up, a, new, christian,

joined, them, after, spinoza, s, death, through, his, mother, spinoza, was, related, to, the, philosopher, uriel, da, costa, who, stirred, controversy, in, amsterdam, s, portuguese, jewish, community, da, costa, questioned, traditional, christian, and, jewish, beliefs, asserting, that, for, example, their, origins, were, based, on, human, inventions, instead, of, god, s, revelation, his, clashes, with, the, religious, establishment, led, to, his, excommunication, twice, by, rabbinic, authorities, who, imposed, humiliation, and, social, exclusion, in, 1639, as, part, of, an, agreement, to, be, readmitted, da, costa, had, to, prostrate, himself, for, worshippers, to, step, over, him, he, died, in, 1640, reportedly, committing, suicide, during, his, childhood, spinoza, was, likely, unaware, of, his, family, connection, with, uriel, da, costa, still, as, a, teenager, he, certainly, heard, discussions, about, him, steven, nadler, explains, that, although, da, costa, died, when, spinoza, was, eight, his, ideas, shaped, spinoza, s, intellectual, development, amsterdam, s, jewish, communities, long, remembered, and, discussed, da, costa, s, skepticism, about, organized, religion, denial, of, the, soul, s, immortality, and, the, idea, that, moses, didn, t, write, the, torah, influencing, spinoza, s, intellectual, journey, spinoza, attended, the, talmud, torah, school, adjoining, the, bet, ya, acov, synagogue, a, few, doors, down, from, his, home, headed, by, the, senior, rabbi, saul, levi, morteira, instructed, in, spanish, the, language, of, learning, and, literature, students, in, the, elementary, school, learned, to, read, the, prayerbook, and, the, torah, in, hebrew, translate, the, weekly, section, into, spanish, and, study, rashi, s, commentary, spinoza, s, name, does, not, appear, on, the, registry, after, age, fourteen, and, he, likely, never, studied, with, rabbis, such, as, manasseh, ben, israel, and, morteira, spinoza, possibly, went, to, work, around, fourteen, and, almost, certainly, was, needed, in, his, father, s, business, after, his, brother, died, in, 1649, during, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, much, of, the, spinoza, firm, s, ships, and, cargo, were, captured, by, english, ships, severely, affecting, the, firm, s, financial, viability, the, firm, was, saddled, with, debt, by, the, war, s, end, in, 1654, due, to, its, merchant, voyages, being, intercepted, by, the, english, leading, to, its, decline, spinoza, s, father, died, in, 1654, making, him, the, head, of, the, family, responsible, for, organizing, and, leading, the, jewish, mourning, rituals, and, in, a, business, partnership, with, his, brother, of, their, inherited, firm, as, spinoza, s, father, had, poor, health, for, some, years, before, his, death, he, was, significantly, involved, in, the, business, putting, his, intellectual, curiosity, on, hold, until, 1656, he, continued, financially, supporting, the, synagogue, and, attending, services, in, compliance, with, synagogue, conventions, and, practice, by, 1655, the, family, s, wealth, had, evaporated, and, the, business, effectively, ended, in, march, 1656, spinoza, went, to, the, city, authorities, for, protection, against, debts, in, the, portuguese, jewish, community, to, free, himself, from, the, responsibility, of, paying, debts, owed, by, his, late, father, spinoza, appealed, to, the, city, to, declare, him, an, orphan, since, he, was, a, legal, minor, not, understanding, his, father, s, indebtedness, would, remove, the, obligation, to, repay, his, debts, and, retrospectively, renounce, his, inheritance, though, he, was, released, of, all, debts, and, legally, in, the, right, his, reputation, as, a, merchant, was, permanently, damaged, in, addition, to, violating, a, synagogue, regulation, that, business, matters, are, to, be, arbitrated, within, the, community, amsterdam, was, tolerant, of, religious, diversity, so, long, as, it, was, practiced, discreetly, the, community, was, concerned, with, protecting, its, reputation, and, not, associating, with, spinoza, lest, his, controversial, views, provide, the, basis, for, possible, persecution, or, expulsion, spinoza, did, not, openly, break, with, jewish, authorities, until, his, father, died, in, 1654, when, he, became, public, and, defiant, resulting, from, lengthy, and, stressful, religious, financial, and, legal, clashes, involving, his, business, and, synagogue, such, as, when, spinoza, violated, synagogue, regulations, by, going, to, city, authorities, rather, than, resolving, his, disputes, within, the, community, to, free, himself, from, paying, his, father, s, debt, on, 27, july, 1656, the, talmud, torah, community, leaders, which, included, aboab, de, fonseca, issued, a, writ, of, herem, against, the, 23, year, old, spinoza, spinoza, s, censure, was, the, harshest, ever, pronounced, in, the, community, carrying, tremendous, emotional, and, spiritual, impact, the, exact, reason, for, expelling, spinoza, is, not, stated, only, referring, to, his, abominable, heresies, monstrous, deeds, and, the, testimony, of, witnesses, in, the, presence, of, the, said, espinoza, even, though, the, amsterdam, municipal, authorities, were, not, directly, involved, in, spinoza, s, censure, the, town, council, expressly, ordered, the, portuguese, jewish, community, to, regulate, their, conduct, and, ensure, that, the, community, kept, strict, observance, of, jewish, law, other, evidence, indicates, a, concern, about, upsetting, civil, authorities, such, as, the, synagogue, s, bans, on, public, weddings, funeral, processions, and, discussing, religious, matters, with, christians, lest, such, activity, might, disturb, the, liberty, we, enjoy, before, the, expulsion, spinoza, had, not, published, anything, or, written, a, treatise, steven, nadler, states, that, if, spinoza, was, voicing, his, criticism, of, judaism, that, later, appeared, through, his, philosophical, works, such, as, part, i, of, ethics, then, there, can, be, no, wonder, that, he, was, severely, punished, unlike, most, censures, issued, by, the, amsterdam, congregation, it, was, never, rescinded, since, the, censure, did, not, lead, to, repentance, after, the, censure, spinoza, may, have, written, an, apologia, in, spanish, defending, his, views, but, it, is, now, lost, spinoza, s, expulsion, did, not, lead, him, to, convert, to, christianity, or, belong, to, a, confessional, religion, or, sect, from, 1656, 61, spinoza, found, lodgings, elsewhere, in, amsterdam, and, leiden, supporting, himself, with, teaching, while, learning, lens, grinding, and, constructing, microscopes, and, telescopes, spinoza, did, not, maintain, a, sense, of, jewish, identity, he, argued, that, without, adherence, to, jewish, law, the, jewish, people, lacked, a, sustaining, source, of, difference, and, identity, rendering, the, notion, of, a, secular, jew, incoherent, sometime, between, 1654, and, 1657, spinoza, started, studying, latin, with, political, radical, franciscus, van, den, enden, a, former, jesuit, and, atheist, who, likely, introduced, spinoza, to, scholastic, and, modern, philosophy, including, descartes, who, had, a, dominant, influence, on, spinoza, s, philosophy, while, boarding, with, van, den, enden, spinoza, studied, in, his, school, where, he, learned, the, arts, and, sciences, and, likely, taught, others, many, of, his, friends, were, either, secularized, freethinkers, or, belonged, to, dissident, christian, groups, that, rejected, the, authority, of, established, churches, and, traditional, dogmas, spinoza, was, acquainted, with, members, of, the, collegiants, a, group, of, disaffected, mennonites, and, other, dissenting, reformed, sects, that, shunned, official, theology, and, must, have, played, some, role, in, spinoza, s, developing, views, on, religion, and, directed, him, to, van, enden, jonathan, israel, conjectures, that, another, possible, influential, figure, was, atheist, translator, jan, hendriksz, glazemaker, a, collaborator, of, spinoza, s, friend, and, publisher, rieuwertsz, who, could, not, have, mentored, spinoza, but, was, in, a, unique, position, to, introduce, spinoza, to, cartesian, philosophy, mathematics, and, lens, grinding, after, learning, latin, with, van, enden, spinoza, studied, at, leiden, university, around, 1658, where, he, audited, classes, in, cartesian, philosophy, from, 1656, 61, spinoza, s, main, discussion, partners, who, formed, his, circle, and, played, a, formative, part, in, spinoza, s, life, were, van, den, enden, pieter, balling, jarig, jelles, lodewijk, meyer, johannes, bouwmeester, and, adriaan, koerbagh, spinoza, s, following, or, philosophical, sect, scrutinized, the, propositions, of, the, ethics, while, it, was, in, draft, and, spinoza, s, second, text, short, treatise, on, god, man, and, his, well, being, though, a, few, prominent, people, in, amsterdam, discussed, the, teachings, of, the, secretive, but, marginal, group, it, was, mainly, a, testing, ground, for, spinoza, s, philosophy, to, extend, his, challenge, to, the, status, quo, their, public, reputation, in, amsterdam, was, negative, with, ole, borch, disparaging, them, as, atheists, throughout, his, life, spinoza, s, general, approach, was, to, avoid, intellectual, battles, clashes, and, public, controversies, viewing, them, as, a, waste, of, energy, that, served, no, real, purpose, between, 1660, and, 1661, spinoza, moved, from, amsterdam, to, rijnsburg, allowing, for, a, quiet, retreat, in, the, country, and, access, to, the, university, town, leiden, where, he, still, had, many, friends, around, this, time, he, wrote, his, short, treatise, on, god, man, and, his, well, being, which, he, never, published, in, his, lifetime, thinking, it, would, enrage, the, theologians, synods, and, city, magistrates, the, short, treatise, a, long, forgotten, text, that, only, survived, in, dutch, translation, was, first, published, by, johannes, van, vloten, in, 1862, while, lodging, with, herman, homan, in, rijnsburg, spinoza, produced, lenses, and, instruments, to, support, himself, and, out, of, scientific, interest, he, began, working, on, his, ethics, and, descartes, principles, of, philosophy, which, he, completed, in, two, weeks, communicating, and, interpreting, descartes, arguments, and, testing, the, water, for, his, metaphysical, and, ethical, ideas, spinoza, s, explanations, of, essential, elements, of, the, cartesian, system, helped, many, interested, people, study, the, system, enhancing, his, philosophical, reputation, this, work, was, published, in, 1663, and, was, one, of, the, two, works, published, in, his, lifetime, under, his, name, spinoza, led, a, modest, and, frugal, lifestyle, earning, income, by, polishing, lenses, and, crafting, telescopes, and, microscopes, he, also, relied, on, the, generous, contributions, of, his, friends, to, support, himself, in, 1663, spinoza, moved, to, voorburg, for, an, unknown, reason, he, continued, working, on, ethics, and, corresponded, with, scientists, and, philosophers, throughout, europe, in, 1665, he, began, writing, the, theological, political, treatise, which, addresses, theological, and, political, issues, such, as, the, interpretation, of, scripture, the, origins, of, the, state, and, the, bounds, of, political, and, religious, authority, while, arguing, for, a, secular, democratic, state, before, the, publication, of, the, theological, political, treatise, spinoza, s, friend, adriaan, koerbagh, published, a, book, that, criticized, organized, religion, denied, the, divine, authorship, of, the, bible, and, asserted, that, miracles, were, impossible, ideas, similar, to, those, of, spinoza, his, work, attracted, the, attention, of, the, authorities, leading, to, his, imprisonment, and, eventual, death, in, prison, anticipating, the, reaction, to, his, ideas, spinoza, published, his, treatise, in, 1670, under, a, false, publisher, and, a, fictitious, place, of, publication, the, work, did, not, remain, anonymous, for, long, samuel, maresius, attacked, spinoza, personally, while, thomas, hobbes, and, johannes, bredenburg, criticized, his, conception, of, god, and, saw, the, book, as, dangerous, and, subversive, spinoza, s, work, was, safer, than, koerbagh, s, because, it, was, written, in, latin, a, language, not, widely, understood, by, the, general, public, and, spinoza, explicitly, forbade, its, translation, the, secular, authorities, varied, enforcing, the, reformed, church, in, amsterdam, s, orders, to, ban, the, distribution, of, the, blasphemous, book, in, 1670, spinoza, moved, to, the, hague, to, have, easier, access, to, the, city, s, intellectual, life, and, to, be, closer, to, his, friends, and, followers, as, he, became, more, famous, spinoza, spent, time, receiving, visitors, and, responding, to, letters, he, returned, to, the, manuscript, of, ethics, reworking, part, three, into, parts, four, and, five, and, composed, a, hebrew, grammar, for, proper, interpretation, of, scripture, and, for, clearing, up, confusion, and, problems, when, studying, the, bible, with, part, one, presenting, etymology, the, alphabet, and, principles, governing, nouns, verbs, and, more, part, two, unfinished, before, he, died, would, have, presented, syntax, rules, another, unfinished, work, from, 1676, was, tractatus, politicus, which, concerns, how, states, can, function, well, and, intended, to, show, that, democratic, states, are, best, spinoza, refused, an, offer, to, be, the, chair, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, heidelberg, perhaps, because, of, the, possibility, that, it, might, curb, his, freedom, of, thought, few, of, spinoza, s, letters, are, extant, and, none, before, 1661, nearly, all, the, contents, are, philosophical, and, technical, because, the, original, editors, of, opera, posthuma, a, collection, of, his, works, published, posthumously, lodewijk, meyer, georg, hermann, schuller, and, johannes, bouwmeester, excluded, personal, matters, and, letters, due, to, the, political, and, ecclesiastical, persecution, of, the, time, spinoza, corresponded, with, peter, serrarius, a, radical, protestant, and, millenarian, merchant, who, was, a, patron, of, spinoza, after, his, expulsion, from, the, jewish, community, he, acted, as, an, intermediary, for, spinoza, s, correspondence, sending, and, receiving, letters, of, the, philosopher, to, and, from, third, parties, they, maintained, their, relationship, until, serrarius, died, in, 1669, through, his, pursuits, in, lens, grinding, mathematics, optics, and, philosophy, spinoza, forged, connections, with, prominent, figures, such, as, scientist, christiaan, huygens, mathematician, johannes, hudde, and, secretary, of, the, british, royal, society, henry, oldenburg, huygens, and, others, notably, praised, the, quality, of, spinoza, s, lenses, spinoza, engaged, in, correspondence, with, willem, van, blijenbergh, an, amateur, calvinist, theologian, who, sought, spinoza, s, view, on, the, nature, of, evil, and, sin, whereas, blijenbergh, deferred, to, the, authority, of, scripture, for, theology, and, philosophy, spinoza, told, him, not, solely, to, look, at, scripture, for, truth, or, anthropomorphize, god, also, spinoza, told, him, their, views, were, incommensurable, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, outwardly, described, spinoza, s, work, negatively, but, privately, wrote, letters, to, him, and, desired, to, examine, the, manuscript, of, the, ethics, in, 1676, leibniz, traveled, to, the, hague, to, meet, spinoza, remaining, with, him, for, three, days, to, converse, about, current, events, and, philosophy, leibniz, s, work, bears, some, striking, resemblances, to, parts, of, spinoza, s, philosophy, like, in, monadology, leibniz, was, concerned, when, his, name, was, not, redacted, in, a, letter, printed, in, the, opera, posthuma, in, 1675, albert, burgh, a, friend, and, possibly, former, pupil, of, spinoza, wrote, to, him, repudiating, his, teachings, and, announcing, his, conversion, to, the, catholic, church, burgh, attacked, spinoza, s, views, as, expressed, in, the, theological, political, treatise, and, tried, to, persuade, spinoza, to, embrace, catholicism, in, response, spinoza, at, the, request, of, burgh, s, family, who, hoped, to, restore, his, reason, wrote, an, angry, letter, mocking, the, catholic, church, and, condemning, all, religious, superstition, spinoza, published, little, in, his, lifetime, and, most, formal, writings, were, in, latin, reaching, few, readers, apart, from, descartes, principles, of, philosophy, and, the, theologico, political, treatise, his, works, appeared, in, print, after, his, death, because, the, reaction, to, his, anonymously, published, work, theologico, political, treatise, was, unfavorable, spinoza, told, supporters, not, to, translate, his, works, and, abstained, from, publishing, further, following, his, death, his, supporters, published, his, works, posthumously, in, latin, and, dutch, his, posthumous, works, opera, posthuma, were, edited, by, his, friends, in, secrecy, to, prevent, the, confiscation, and, destruction, of, manuscripts, he, wore, a, signet, ring, to, mark, his, letters, engraved, with, the, latin, word, caute, meaning, caution, and, the, image, of, a, thorny, rose, spinoza, s, health, began, to, fail, in, 1676, and, he, died, in, the, hague, on, 21, february, 1677, at, age, 44, attended, by, a, physician, friend, georg, herman, schuller, spinoza, had, been, ill, with, some, form, of, lung, affliction, probably, tuberculosis, and, possibly, complicated, by, silicosis, brought, on, by, grinding, glass, lenses, although, spinoza, had, been, becoming, sicker, for, weeks, his, death, was, sudden, and, he, died, without, leaving, a, will, reports, circulated, that, he, repented, his, philosophical, stances, on, his, deathbed, but, these, tales, petered, out, in, the, 18th, century, lutheran, preacher, johannes, colerus, wrote, the, first, biography, of, spinoza, for, the, original, reason, of, researching, his, final, days, by, the, time, of, his, death, he, had, never, married, and, had, no, children, spinoza, was, buried, inside, the, nieuwe, kerk, four, days, after, his, death, with, six, others, in, the, same, vault, at, the, time, there, was, no, memorial, plaque, for, spinoza, in, the, 18th, century, the, vault, was, emptied, and, the, remnants, scattered, over, the, earth, of, the, churchyard, the, memorial, plaque, is, outside, the, church, where, some, of, his, remains, are, part, of, the, churchyard, s, soil, spinoza, s, friends, rescued, his, personal, belongings, papers, and, unpublished, manuscripts, his, supporters, took, them, away, for, safekeeping, from, seizure, by, those, wishing, to, suppress, his, writings, and, they, do, not, appear, in, the, inventory, of, his, possessions, at, death, within, a, year, of, his, death, his, supporters, translated, his, latin, manuscripts, into, dutch, and, other, languages, secular, authorities, and, later, the, roman, catholic, church, banned, his, works, despite, being, published, in, latin, rather, than, a, vernacular, language, this, 1670, treatise, published, in, spinoza, s, lifetime, caused, a, huge, reaction, described, as, one, of, the, most, significant, events, in, european, intellectual, history, the, ethics, has, been, associated, with, that, of, leibniz, and, ren, descartes, as, part, of, the, rationalist, school, of, thought, which, includes, the, assumption, that, ideas, correspond, to, reality, perfectly, in, the, same, way, that, mathematics, is, supposed, to, be, an, exact, representation, of, the, world, the, ethics, contains, many, unresolved, obscurities, and, is, written, with, a, forbidding, mathematical, structure, modeled, on, euclid, s, geometry, and, has, been, described, as, a, superbly, cryptic, masterwork, the, writings, of, ren, descartes, have, been, described, as, spinoza, s, starting, point, spinoza, s, first, publication, was, his, 1663, geometric, exposition, of, proofs, using, euclid, s, model, with, definitions, and, axioms, of, descartes, principles, of, philosophy, following, descartes, spinoza, aimed, to, understand, truth, through, logical, deductions, from, clear, and, distinct, ideas, a, process, which, always, begins, from, the, self, evident, truths, of, axioms, however, his, actual, project, does, not, end, there, from, his, first, work, to, his, last, one, there, runs, a, thread, of, attending, to, the, highest, good, which, also, is, the, highest, truth, and, thereby, achieving, a, state, of, peace, and, harmony, either, metaphysically, or, politically, in, this, light, the, principles, of, philosophy, might, be, viewed, as, an, exercise, in, geometric, method, and, philosophy, paving, the, way, for, numerous, concepts, and, conclusions, that, would, define, his, philosophy, see, cogitata, metaphysica, spinoza, s, metaphysics, consists, of, one, thing, substance, and, its, modifications, modes, early, in, the, ethics, spinoza, argues, that, only, one, substance, is, absolutely, infinite, self, caused, and, eternal, he, calls, this, substance, god, or, nature, he, takes, these, two, terms, to, be, synonymous, in, the, latin, the, phrase, he, uses, is, deus, sive, natura, for, spinoza, the, whole, of, the, natural, universe, consists, of, one, substance, god, or, what, is, the, same, nature, and, its, modifications, modes, it, cannot, be, overemphasized, how, the, rest, of, spinoza, s, philosophy, his, philosophy, of, mind, his, epistemology, his, psychology, his, moral, philosophy, his, political, philosophy, and, his, philosophy, of, religion, flows, more, or, less, directly, from, the, metaphysical, underpinnings, in, part, i, of, the, ethics, spinoza, sets, forth, a, vision, of, being, illuminated, by, his, awareness, of, god, they, may, seem, strange, at, first, sight, to, the, question, what, is, he, replies, substance, its, attributes, and, modes, following, maimonides, spinoza, defined, substance, as, that, which, is, in, itself, and, is, conceived, through, itself, meaning, that, it, can, be, understood, without, any, reference, to, anything, external, being, conceptually, independent, also, means, that, the, same, thing, is, ontologically, independent, depending, on, nothing, else, for, its, existence, and, being, the, cause, of, itself, causa, sui, a, mode, is, something, which, cannot, exist, independently, but, rather, must, do, so, as, part, of, something, else, on, which, it, depends, including, properties, for, example, color, relations, such, as, size, and, individual, things, modes, can, be, further, divided, into, finite, and, infinite, ones, with, the, latter, being, evident, in, every, finite, mode, he, gives, examples, of, motion, and, rest, the, traditional, understanding, of, an, attribute, in, philosophy, is, similar, to, spinoza, s, modes, though, he, uses, that, word, differently, to, him, an, attribute, is, that, which, the, intellect, perceives, as, constituting, the, essence, of, substance, and, there, are, possibly, an, infinite, number, of, them, it, is, the, essential, nature, that, is, attributed, to, reality, by, intellect, spinoza, defined, god, as, a, substance, consisting, of, infinite, attributes, each, of, which, expresses, eternal, and, infinite, essence, and, since, no, cause, or, reason, can, prevent, such, a, being, from, existing, it, must, exist, this, is, a, form, of, the, ontological, argument, which, is, claimed, to, prove, the, existence, of, god, but, spinoza, went, further, in, stating, that, it, showed, that, only, god, exists, accordingly, he, stated, that, whatever, is, is, in, god, and, nothing, can, exist, or, be, conceived, without, god, this, means, that, god, is, identical, with, the, universe, an, idea, which, he, encapsulated, in, the, phrase, deus, sive, natura, god, or, nature, which, some, have, interpreted, as, atheism, or, pantheism, though, there, are, many, more, of, them, god, can, be, known, by, humans, either, through, the, attribute, of, extension, or, the, attribute, of, thought, thought, and, extension, represent, giving, complete, accounts, of, the, world, in, mental, or, physical, terms, to, this, end, he, says, that, the, mind, and, the, body, are, one, and, the, same, thing, which, is, conceived, now, under, the, attribute, of, thought, now, under, the, attribute, of, extension, after, stating, his, proof, for, god, s, existence, spinoza, addresses, who, god, is, spinoza, believed, that, god, is, the, sum, of, the, natural, and, physical, laws, of, the, universe, and, certainly, not, an, individual, entity, or, creator, spinoza, attempts, to, prove, that, god, is, just, the, substance, of, the, universe, by, first, stating, that, substances, do, not, share, attributes, or, essences, and, then, demonstrating, that, god, is, a, substance, with, an, infinite, number, of, attributes, thus, the, attributes, possessed, by, any, other, substances, must, also, be, possessed, by, god, therefore, god, is, just, the, sum, of, all, the, substances, of, the, universe, god, is, the, only, substance, in, the, universe, and, everything, is, a, part, of, god, this, view, was, described, by, charles, hartshorne, as, classical, pantheism, spinoza, argues, that, things, could, not, have, been, produced, by, god, in, any, other, way, or, in, any, other, order, than, is, the, case, therefore, concepts, such, as, freedom, and, chance, have, little, meaning, this, picture, of, spinoza, s, determinism, is, illuminated, in, ethics, the, infant, believes, that, it, is, by, free, will, that, it, seeks, the, breast, the, angry, boy, believes, that, by, free, will, he, wishes, vengeance, the, timid, man, thinks, it, is, with, free, will, he, seeks, flight, the, drunkard, believes, that, by, a, free, command, of, his, mind, he, speaks, the, things, which, when, sober, he, wishes, he, had, left, unsaid, all, believe, that, they, speak, by, a, free, command, of, the, mind, whilst, in, truth, they, have, no, power, to, restrain, the, impulse, which, they, have, to, speak, in, his, letter, to, g, h, schuller, letter, 58, he, wrote, men, are, conscious, of, their, desire, and, unaware, of, the, causes, by, which, are, determined, he, also, held, that, knowledge, of, true, causes, of, passive, emotion, can, transform, it, into, an, active, emotion, thus, anticipating, one, of, the, key, ideas, of, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalysis, according, to, eric, schliesser, spinoza, was, skeptical, regarding, the, possibility, of, knowledge, of, nature, and, as, a, consequence, at, odds, with, scientists, such, as, galileo, and, huygens, although, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, is, commonly, associated, with, gottfried, leibniz, spinoza, employs, it, in, a, more, systematic, manner, in, spinoza, s, philosophical, framework, questions, concerning, why, a, particular, phenomenon, exists, are, always, answerable, and, these, answers, are, provided, in, terms, of, the, relevant, cause, spinoza, s, approach, involves, first, providing, an, account, of, a, phenomenon, such, as, goodness, or, consciousness, to, explain, it, and, then, further, explaining, the, phenomenon, in, terms, of, itself, for, instance, he, might, argue, that, consciousness, is, the, degree, of, power, of, a, mental, state, spinoza, has, also, been, described, as, an, epicurean, materialist, specifically, in, reference, to, his, opposition, to, cartesian, mind, body, dualism, this, view, was, held, by, epicureans, before, him, as, they, believed, that, atoms, with, their, probabilistic, paths, were, the, only, substance, that, existed, fundamentally, spinoza, however, deviated, significantly, from, epicureans, by, adhering, to, strict, determinism, much, like, the, stoics, before, him, in, contrast, to, the, epicurean, belief, in, the, probabilistic, path, of, atoms, which, is, more, in, line, with, contemporary, thought, on, quantum, mechanics, one, thing, which, seems, on, the, surface, to, distinguish, spinoza, s, view, of, the, emotions, from, both, descartes, and, hume, s, pictures, of, them, is, that, he, takes, the, emotions, to, be, cognitive, in, some, important, respect, jonathan, bennett, claims, that, spinoza, mainly, saw, emotions, as, caused, by, cognitions, he, did, not, say, this, clearly, enough, and, sometimes, lost, sight, of, it, entirely, spinoza, provides, several, demonstrations, which, purport, to, show, truths, about, how, human, emotions, work, the, picture, presented, is, according, to, bennett, unflattering, coloured, as, it, is, by, universal, egoism, spinoza, s, notion, of, blessedness, figures, centrally, in, his, ethical, philosophy, spinoza, writes, that, blessedness, or, salvation, or, freedom, consists, namely, in, a, constant, and, eternal, love, of, god, or, in, god, s, love, for, men, philosopher, jonathan, bennett, interprets, this, as, spinoza, wanting, blessedness, to, stand, for, the, most, elevated, and, desirable, state, one, could, possibly, be, in, understanding, what, is, meant, by, most, elevated, and, desirable, state, requires, understanding, spinoza, s, notion, of, conatus, striving, but, not, necessarily, with, any, teleological, baggage, and, that, perfection, refers, not, to, moral, value, but, to, completeness, given, that, individuals, are, identified, as, mere, modifications, of, the, infinite, substance, it, follows, that, no, individual, can, ever, be, fully, complete, i, e, perfect, or, blessed, absolute, perfection, is, in, spinoza, s, thought, reserved, solely, for, substance, nevertheless, modes, can, attain, a, lesser, form, of, blessedness, namely, that, of, pure, understanding, of, oneself, as, one, really, is, i, e, as, a, definite, modification, of, substance, in, a, certain, set, of, relationships, with, everything, else, in, the, universe, that, this, is, what, spinoza, has, in, mind, can, be, seen, at, the, end, of, the, ethics, in, e5p24, and, e5p25, where, spinoza, makes, two, final, key, moves, unifying, the, metaphysical, epistemological, and, ethical, propositions, he, has, developed, over, the, course, of, the, work, in, e5p24, he, links, the, understanding, of, particular, things, to, the, understanding, of, god, or, substance, in, e5p25, the, conatus, of, the, mind, is, linked, to, the, third, kind, of, knowledge, intuition, from, here, it, is, a, short, step, to, the, connection, of, blessedness, with, the, amor, dei, intellectualis, intellectual, love, of, god, this, unfinished, treatise, in, latin, expounds, spinoza, s, ideas, about, forms, of, government, as, with, the, ethics, this, work, was, published, posthumously, by, his, circle, of, supporters, in, latin, and, in, dutch, the, subtitle, is, in, quo, demonstratur, quomodo, societas, ubi, imperium, monarchicum, locum, habet, sicut, et, ea, ubi, optimi, imperant, debet, institui, ne, in, tyrannidem, labatur, et, ut, pax, libertasque, civium, inviolata, maneat, in, which, it, is, demonstrated, how, a, society, may, it, be, a, monarchy, or, an, aristocracy, can, be, best, governed, so, as, not, to, fall, into, tyranny, and, so, that, the, peace, and, liberty, of, the, citizens, remain, unviolated, although, spinoza, s, political, and, theological, thought, was, radical, on, many, ways, he, held, traditional, views, on, the, place, of, women, in, the, tp, he, writes, briefly, on, the, last, page, of, the, tp, that, women, were, naturally, subordinate, to, men, stating, bluntly, his, women, are, by, nature, not, by, institutional, practice, subordinate, to, men, both, his, major, biographers, in, english, remark, on, his, view, of, women, biographer, steven, nadler, is, clearly, disappointed, by, spinoza, s, only, statement, on, women, it, is, unfortunate, that, the, very, last, words, we, have, by, him, at, the, end, of, the, extant, chapters, of, the, political, treatise, are, a, short, digression, on, the, unsuitability, of, women, to, hold, political, power, likewise, jonathan, i, israel, says, that, spinoza, s, views, are, hugely, disappointing, to, the, modern, reader, and, that, most, that, can, be, said, in, his, defense, is, that, in, his, age, rampant, tyrannizing, over, women, was, indeed, universal, he, goes, on, to, say, one, may, legitimately, wonder, why, did, spinoza, if, he, was, to, be, consistent, not, apply, his, highly, sceptical, and, innovative, for, his, time, uniquely, subversive, de, legtimizing, general, principle, likewise, to, men, s, tyrannizing, over, women, one, scholar, has, attempted, to, rationalize, spinoza, s, views, excluding, women, from, full, citizenship, but, the, topic, has, not, attracted, major, consideration, in, spinoza, studies, spinoza, was, considered, to, be, an, atheist, because, he, used, the, word, god, to, signify, a, concept, that, was, different, from, that, of, traditional, judeo, christian, monotheism, spinoza, expressly, denies, personality, and, consciousness, to, god, he, has, neither, intelligence, feeling, nor, will, he, does, not, act, according, to, purpose, but, everything, follows, necessarily, from, his, nature, according, to, law, thus, spinoza, s, cool, indifferent, god, differs, from, the, concept, of, an, anthropomorphic, fatherly, god, who, cares, about, humanity, in, 1785, friedrich, heinrich, jacobi, published, a, condemnation, of, spinoza, s, pantheism, after, gotthold, lessing, was, thought, to, have, confessed, on, his, deathbed, to, being, a, spinozist, which, was, the, equivalent, in, his, time, of, being, called, an, atheist, jacobi, claimed, that, spinoza, s, doctrine, was, pure, materialism, because, all, nature, and, god, are, said, to, be, nothing, but, extended, substance, this, for, jacobi, was, the, result, of, enlightenment, rationalism, and, it, would, finally, end, in, absolute, atheism, moses, mendelssohn, disagreed, with, jacobi, saying, that, there, is, no, actual, difference, between, theism, and, pantheism, the, issue, became, a, major, intellectual, and, religious, concern, for, european, civilization, at, the, time, the, attraction, of, spinoza, s, philosophy, to, late, 18th, century, europeans, was, that, it, provided, an, alternative, to, materialism, atheism, and, deism, three, of, spinoza, s, ideas, strongly, appealed, to, them, by, 1879, spinoza, s, pantheism, was, praised, by, many, but, was, considered, by, some, to, be, alarming, and, dangerously, inimical, spinoza, s, god, or, nature, deus, sive, natura, provided, a, living, natural, god, in, contrast, to, isaac, newton, s, first, cause, argument, and, the, dead, mechanism, of, julien, offray, de, la, mettrie, s, 1709, 1751, work, man, a, machine, l, homme, machine, coleridge, and, shelley, saw, in, spinoza, s, philosophy, a, religion, of, nature, novalis, called, him, the, god, intoxicated, man, spinoza, inspired, the, poet, shelley, to, write, his, essay, the, necessity, of, atheism, it, is, a, widespread, belief, that, spinoza, equated, god, with, the, material, universe, he, has, therefore, been, called, the, prophet, and, prince, and, most, eminent, expounder, of, pantheism, more, specifically, in, a, letter, to, henry, oldenburg, he, states, as, to, the, view, of, certain, people, that, i, identify, god, with, nature, taken, as, a, kind, of, mass, or, corporeal, matter, they, are, quite, mistaken, for, spinoza, the, universe, cosmos, is, a, mode, under, two, attributes, of, thought, and, extension, god, has, infinitely, many, other, attributes, which, are, not, present, in, the, world, according, to, german, philosopher, karl, jaspers, 1883, 1969, when, spinoza, wrote, deus, sive, natura, latin, for, god, or, nature, spinoza, meant, god, was, natura, naturans, nature, doing, what, nature, does, literally, nature, naturing, not, natura, naturata, nature, already, created, literally, nature, natured, jaspers, believed, that, spinoza, in, his, philosophical, system, did, not, mean, to, say, that, god, and, nature, are, interchangeable, terms, but, rather, that, god, s, transcendence, was, attested, by, his, infinitely, many, attributes, and, that, two, attributes, known, by, humans, namely, thought, and, extension, signified, god, s, immanence, even, god, under, the, attributes, of, thought, and, extension, cannot, be, identified, strictly, with, our, world, that, world, is, of, course, divisible, it, has, parts, but, spinoza, said, no, attribute, of, a, substance, can, be, truly, conceived, from, which, it, follows, that, the, substance, can, be, divided, meaning, that, one, cannot, conceive, an, attribute, in, a, way, that, leads, to, division, of, substance, he, also, said, a, substance, which, is, absolutely, infinite, is, indivisible, ethics, part, i, propositions, 12, and, 13, following, this, logic, our, world, should, be, considered, as, a, mode, under, two, attributes, of, thought, and, extension, therefore, according, to, jaspers, the, pantheist, formula, one, and, all, would, apply, to, spinoza, only, if, the, one, preserves, its, transcendence, and, the, all, were, not, interpreted, as, the, totality, of, finite, things, martial, gu, roult, 1891, 1976, suggested, the, term, panentheism, rather, than, pantheism, to, describe, spinoza, s, view, of, the, relation, between, god, and, the, world, the, world, is, not, god, but, in, a, strong, sense, in, god, not, only, do, finite, things, have, god, as, their, cause, they, cannot, be, conceived, without, god, however, american, panentheist, philosopher, charles, hartshorne, 1897, 2000, insisted, on, the, term, classical, pantheism, to, describe, spinoza, s, view, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, spinoza, s, god, is, an, infinite, intellect, ethics, 2p11c, all, knowing, 2p3, and, capable, of, loving, both, himself, and, us, insofar, as, we, are, part, of, his, perfection, 5p35c, and, if, the, mark, of, a, personal, being, is, that, it, is, one, towards, which, we, can, entertain, personal, attitudes, then, we, should, note, too, that, spinoza, recommends, amor, intellectualis, dei, the, intellectual, love, of, god, as, the, supreme, good, for, man, 5p33, however, the, matter, is, complex, spinoza, s, god, does, not, have, free, will, 1p32c1, he, does, not, have, purposes, or, intentions, 1, appendix, and, spinoza, insists, that, neither, intellect, nor, will, pertain, to, the, nature, of, god, 1p17s1, moreover, while, we, may, love, god, we, need, to, remember, that, god, is, not, a, being, who, could, ever, love, us, back, he, who, loves, god, cannot, strive, that, god, should, love, him, in, return, says, spinoza, 5p19, steven, nadler, suggests, that, settling, the, question, of, spinoza, s, atheism, or, pantheism, depends, on, an, analysis, of, attitudes, if, pantheism, is, associated, with, religiosity, then, spinoza, is, not, a, pantheist, since, spinoza, believes, that, the, proper, stance, to, take, towards, god, is, not, one, of, reverence, or, religious, awe, but, instead, one, of, objective, study, and, reason, since, taking, the, religious, stance, would, leave, one, open, to, the, possibility, of, error, and, superstition, many, authors, have, discussed, similarities, between, spinoza, s, philosophy, and, eastern, philosophical, traditions, few, decades, after, the, philosopher, s, death, pierre, bayle, in, his, famous, historical, and, critical, dictionary, 1697, pointed, out, a, link, between, spinoza, s, alleged, atheism, with, the, theology, of, a, chinese, sect, supposedly, called, foe, kiao, of, which, had, learned, thanks, to, the, testimonies, of, the, jesuit, missions, in, eastern, asia, a, century, later, kant, also, established, a, parallel, between, the, philosophy, of, spinoza, and, the, thinking, of, laozi, a, monstrous, system, in, his, words, grouping, both, under, the, name, of, pantheists, criticizing, what, he, described, as, mystical, tendencies, in, them, in, 1863, elijah, benamozegh, purported, to, establish, that, the, main, source, of, spinoza, s, ontology, is, kabbalah, the, most, recent, research, in, the, field, seems, to, vindicate, that, claim, the, 19th, century, german, sanskritist, theodor, goldst, cker, was, one, of, the, early, figures, to, notice, the, similarities, between, spinoza, s, religious, conceptions, and, the, vedanta, tradition, of, india, writing, that, spinoza, s, thought, was, so, exact, a, representation, of, the, ideas, of, the, vedanta, that, we, might, have, suspected, its, founder, to, have, borrowed, the, fundamental, principles, of, his, system, from, the, hindus, did, his, biography, not, satisfy, us, that, he, was, wholly, unacquainted, with, their, doctrines, max, m, ller, also, noted, the, striking, similarities, between, vedanta, and, the, system, of, spinoza, equating, the, brahman, in, vedanta, to, spinoza, s, substantia, spinoza, s, ideas, have, had, a, major, impact, on, intellectual, debates, from, the, seventeenth, century, to, the, current, era, how, spinoza, is, viewed, has, gone, from, the, atheistic, author, of, treatises, that, undermine, judaism, and, organized, religion, to, a, cultural, hero, the, first, secular, jew, one, writer, contends, that, what, draws, readers, to, spinoza, today, and, makes, him, perhaps, the, most, beloved, philosopher, since, socrates, is, his, confident, equanimity, he, is, not, a, despairing, nihilist, but, rather, spinoza, says, that, blessedness, is, nothing, else, but, the, contentment, of, spirit, which, arises, from, the, intuitive, knowledge, of, god, one, of, his, biographers, jonathan, i, israel, argues, that, no, leading, figure, of, the, post, 1750, later, enlightenment, for, example, or, the, nineteenth, century, was, engaged, with, the, philosophy, of, descartes, hobbes, bayle, locke, or, leibniz, to, the, degree, leading, figures, such, as, lessing, goethe, kant, hegel, fichte, schelling, heine, george, eliot, and, nietzsche, remained, preoccupied, throughout, their, creative, lives, with, spinoza, hegel, 1770, 1831, asserts, that, the, fact, is, that, spinoza, is, made, a, testing, point, in, modern, philosophy, so, that, it, may, really, be, said, you, are, either, a, spinozist, or, not, a, philosopher, at, all, his, expulsion, from, the, portuguese, synagogue, in, 1656, has, stirred, debate, over, the, years, on, whether, he, is, the, first, modern, jew, spinoza, influenced, discussions, of, the, so, called, jewish, question, the, examination, of, the, idea, of, judaism, and, the, modern, secular, jew, moses, mendelsohn, lessing, heine, and, kant, as, well, as, subsequent, thinkers, including, marx, nietzsche, and, freud, were, influenced, by, spinoza, the, changing, conception, of, spinoza, as, the, first, modern, jew, has, been, explicitly, explored, by, various, authors, his, expulsion, has, been, revisited, in, the, 21st, century, with, jewish, writers, such, berthold, auerbach, salomon, rubin, who, translated, spinoza, s, ethics, into, hebrew, and, saw, spinoza, as, a, new, maimonides, penning, a, new, guide, to, the, perplexed, zionist, yosef, klausner, and, fiction, writer, isaac, bashevis, singer, shaping, his, image, in, 1886, the, young, george, santayana, published, the, ethical, doctrine, of, spinoza, in, the, harvard, monthly, much, later, he, wrote, an, introduction, to, spinoza, s, ethics, and, de, intellectus, emendatione, in, 1932, santayana, was, invited, to, present, an, essay, published, as, ultimate, religion, at, a, meeting, at, the, hague, celebrating, the, tricentennial, of, spinoza, s, birth, in, santayana, s, autobiography, he, characterized, spinoza, as, his, master, and, model, in, understanding, the, naturalistic, basis, of, morality, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, evoked, spinoza, with, the, title, suggested, to, him, by, g, e, moore, of, the, english, translation, of, his, first, definitive, philosophical, work, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, an, allusion, to, spinoza, s, tractatus, theologico, politicus, elsewhere, wittgenstein, deliberately, borrowed, the, expression, sub, specie, aeternitatis, from, spinoza, notebooks, 1914, 16, p, 83, the, structure, of, his, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, does, have, some, structural, affinities, with, spinoza, s, ethics, though, admittedly, not, with, the, spinoza, s, tractatus, in, erecting, complex, philosophical, arguments, upon, basic, logical, propositions, and, principles, in, propositions, 6, 4311, and, 6, 45, he, alludes, to, a, spinozian, understanding, of, eternity, and, interpretation, of, the, religious, concept, of, eternal, life, contending, if, by, eternity, is, understood, not, eternal, temporal, duration, but, timelessness, then, he, lives, eternally, who, lives, in, the, present, 6, 4311, the, contemplation, of, the, world, sub, specie, aeterni, is, its, contemplation, as, a, limited, whole, 6, 45, spinoza, s, philosophy, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, post, war, french, philosophy, many, of, these, philosophers, used, spinoza, to, erect, a, bulwark, against, the, nominally, irrationalist, tendencies, of, phenomenology, which, was, associated, with, the, dominance, of, hegel, martin, heidegger, and, edmund, husserl, in, france, at, that, time, louis, althusser, as, well, as, his, colleagues, such, as, tienne, balibar, saw, in, spinoza, a, philosophy,
