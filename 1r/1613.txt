sir, isaac, newton, frs, 25, december, 1642, 20, march, 1726, 27, was, an, english, polymath, active, as, a, mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and, author, who, was, described, in, his, time, as, a, natural, philosopher, he, was, a, key, figure, in, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, enlightenment, that, followed, his, pioneering, book, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, first, published, in, 1687, consolidated, many, previous, results, and, established, classical, mechanics, newton, also, made, seminal, contributions, to, optics, and, shares, credit, with, german, mathematician, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, for, formulating, infinitesimal, calculus, though, some, say, he, developed, calculus, years, before, leibniz, in, the, principia, newton, formulated, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, that, formed, the, dominant, scientific, viewpoint, for, centuries, until, it, was, superseded, by, the, theory, of, relativity, he, used, his, mathematical, description, of, gravity, to, derive, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, account, for, tides, the, trajectories, of, comets, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, and, other, phenomena, eradicating, doubt, about, the, solar, system, s, heliocentricity, he, demonstrated, that, the, motion, of, objects, on, earth, and, celestial, bodies, could, be, accounted, for, by, the, same, principles, newton, s, inference, that, the, earth, is, an, oblate, spheroid, was, later, confirmed, by, the, geodetic, measurements, of, maupertuis, la, condamine, and, others, convincing, most, european, scientists, of, the, superiority, of, newtonian, mechanics, over, earlier, systems, he, built, the, first, practical, reflecting, telescope, and, developed, a, sophisticated, theory, of, colour, based, on, the, observation, that, a, prism, separates, white, light, into, the, colours, of, the, visible, spectrum, his, work, on, light, was, collected, in, his, highly, influential, book, opticks, published, in, 1704, he, formulated, an, empirical, law, of, cooling, which, was, the, first, heat, transfer, formulation, made, the, first, theoretical, calculation, of, the, speed, of, sound, and, introduced, the, notion, of, a, newtonian, fluid, furthermore, he, made, early, investigations, into, electricity, with, an, idea, from, his, book, opticks, arguably, the, beginning, of, the, field, theory, of, the, electric, force, in, addition, to, his, work, on, calculus, as, a, mathematician, he, contributed, to, the, study, of, power, series, generalised, the, binomial, theorem, to, non, integer, exponents, developed, a, method, for, approximating, the, roots, of, a, function, and, classified, most, of, the, cubic, plane, curves, newton, was, a, fellow, of, trinity, college, and, the, second, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, cambridge, he, was, a, devout, but, unorthodox, christian, who, privately, rejected, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, he, refused, to, take, holy, orders, in, the, church, of, england, unlike, most, members, of, the, cambridge, faculty, of, the, day, beyond, his, work, on, the, mathematical, sciences, newton, dedicated, much, of, his, time, to, the, study, of, alchemy, and, biblical, chronology, but, most, of, his, work, in, those, areas, remained, unpublished, until, long, after, his, death, politically, and, personally, tied, to, the, whig, party, newton, served, two, brief, terms, as, member, of, parliament, for, the, university, of, cambridge, in, 1689, 1690, and, 1701, 1702, he, was, knighted, by, queen, anne, in, 1705, and, spent, the, last, three, decades, of, his, life, in, london, serving, as, warden, 1696, 1699, and, master, 1699, 1727, of, the, royal, mint, as, well, as, president, of, the, royal, society, 1703, 1727, isaac, newton, was, born, according, to, the, julian, calendar, in, use, in, england, at, the, time, on, christmas, day, 25, december, 1642, ns, 4, january, 1643, at, woolsthorpe, manor, in, woolsthorpe, by, colsterworth, a, hamlet, in, the, county, of, lincolnshire, his, father, also, named, isaac, newton, had, died, three, months, before, born, prematurely, newton, was, a, small, child, his, mother, hannah, ayscough, reportedly, said, that, he, could, have, fit, inside, a, quart, mug, when, newton, was, three, his, mother, remarried, and, went, to, live, with, her, new, husband, the, reverend, barnabas, smith, leaving, her, son, in, the, care, of, his, maternal, grandmother, margery, ayscough, n, e, blythe, newton, disliked, his, stepfather, and, maintained, some, enmity, towards, his, mother, for, marrying, him, as, revealed, by, this, entry, in, a, list, of, sins, committed, up, to, the, age, of, 19, threatening, my, father, and, mother, smith, to, burn, them, and, the, house, over, them, newton, s, mother, had, three, children, mary, benjamin, and, hannah, from, her, second, marriage, from, the, age, of, about, twelve, until, he, was, seventeen, newton, was, educated, at, the, king, s, school, in, grantham, which, taught, latin, and, ancient, greek, and, probably, imparted, a, significant, foundation, of, mathematics, he, was, removed, from, school, by, his, mother, and, returned, to, woolsthorpe, by, colsterworth, by, october, 1659, his, mother, widowed, for, the, second, time, attempted, to, make, him, a, farmer, an, occupation, he, hated, henry, stokes, master, at, the, king, s, school, persuaded, his, mother, to, send, him, back, to, school, motivated, partly, by, a, desire, for, revenge, against, a, schoolyard, bully, he, became, the, top, ranked, student, distinguishing, himself, mainly, by, building, sundials, and, models, of, windmills, in, june, 1661, newton, was, admitted, to, trinity, college, at, the, university, of, cambridge, his, uncle, the, reverend, william, ayscough, who, had, studied, at, cambridge, recommended, him, to, the, university, at, cambridge, newton, started, as, a, subsizar, paying, his, way, by, performing, valet, duties, until, he, was, awarded, a, scholarship, in, 1664, which, covered, his, university, costs, for, four, more, years, until, the, completion, of, his, ma, at, the, time, cambridge, s, teachings, were, based, on, those, of, aristotle, whom, newton, read, along, with, then, more, modern, philosophers, including, descartes, and, astronomers, such, as, galileo, galilei, and, thomas, street, he, set, down, in, his, notebook, a, series, of, quaestiones, about, mechanical, philosophy, as, he, found, it, in, 1665, he, discovered, the, generalised, binomial, theorem, and, began, to, develop, a, mathematical, theory, that, later, became, calculus, soon, after, newton, obtained, his, ba, degree, at, cambridge, in, august, 1665, the, university, temporarily, closed, as, a, precaution, against, the, great, plague, although, he, had, been, undistinguished, as, a, cambridge, student, newton, s, private, studies, at, his, home, in, woolsthorpe, over, the, next, two, years, saw, the, development, of, his, theories, on, calculus, optics, and, the, law, of, gravitation, in, april, 1667, newton, returned, to, the, university, of, cambridge, and, in, october, he, was, elected, as, a, fellow, of, trinity, fellows, were, required, to, take, holy, orders, and, be, ordained, as, anglican, priests, although, this, was, not, enforced, in, the, restoration, years, and, an, assertion, of, conformity, to, the, church, of, england, was, sufficient, he, made, the, commitment, that, i, will, either, set, theology, as, the, object, of, my, studies, and, will, take, holy, orders, when, the, time, prescribed, by, these, statutes, arrives, or, i, will, resign, from, the, college, up, until, this, point, he, had, not, thought, much, about, religion, and, had, twice, signed, his, agreement, to, the, thirty, nine, articles, the, basis, of, church, of, england, doctrine, by, 1675, the, issue, could, not, be, avoided, and, by, then, his, unconventional, views, stood, in, the, way, his, academic, work, impressed, the, lucasian, professor, isaac, barrow, who, was, anxious, to, develop, his, own, religious, and, administrative, potential, he, became, master, of, trinity, college, two, years, later, in, 1669, newton, succeeded, him, only, one, year, after, receiving, his, ma, the, terms, of, the, lucasian, professorship, required, that, the, holder, not, be, active, in, the, church, presumably, to, leave, more, time, for, science, newton, argued, that, this, should, exempt, him, from, the, ordination, requirement, and, king, charles, ii, whose, permission, was, needed, accepted, this, argument, thus, a, conflict, between, newton, s, religious, views, and, anglican, orthodoxy, was, averted, the, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, cambridge, position, included, the, responsibility, of, instructing, geography, in, 1672, and, again, in, 1681, newton, published, a, revised, corrected, and, amended, edition, of, the, geographia, generalis, a, geography, textbook, first, published, in, 1650, by, the, then, deceased, bernhardus, varenius, in, the, geographia, generalis, varenius, attempted, to, create, a, theoretical, foundation, linking, scientific, principles, to, classical, concepts, in, geography, and, considered, geography, to, be, a, mix, between, science, and, pure, mathematics, applied, to, quantifying, features, of, the, earth, while, it, is, unclear, if, newton, ever, lectured, in, geography, the, 1733, dugdale, and, shaw, english, translation, of, the, book, stated, newton, published, the, book, to, be, read, by, students, while, he, lectured, on, the, subject, the, geographia, generalis, is, viewed, by, some, as, the, dividing, line, between, ancient, and, modern, traditions, in, the, history, of, geography, and, newton, s, involvement, in, the, subsequent, editions, is, thought, to, be, a, large, part, of, the, reason, for, this, enduring, legacy, newton, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1672, newton, s, work, has, been, said, to, distinctly, advance, every, branch, of, mathematics, then, studied, his, work, on, the, subject, usually, referred, to, as, fluxions, or, calculus, seen, in, a, manuscript, of, october, 1666, is, now, published, among, newton, s, mathematical, papers, his, work, de, analysi, per, aequationes, numero, terminorum, infinitas, sent, by, isaac, barrow, to, john, collins, in, june, 1669, was, identified, by, barrow, in, a, letter, sent, to, collins, that, august, as, the, work, of, an, extraordinary, genius, and, proficiency, in, these, things, newton, later, became, involved, in, a, dispute, with, leibniz, over, priority, in, the, development, of, calculus, most, modern, historians, believe, that, newton, and, leibniz, developed, calculus, independently, although, with, very, different, mathematical, notations, however, it, is, established, that, newton, came, to, develop, calculus, much, earlier, than, leibniz, leibniz, s, notation, and, differential, method, nowadays, recognised, as, much, more, convenient, notations, were, adopted, by, continental, european, mathematicians, and, after, 1820, or, so, also, by, british, mathematicians, his, work, extensively, uses, calculus, in, geometric, form, based, on, limiting, values, of, the, ratios, of, vanishingly, small, quantities, in, the, principia, itself, newton, gave, demonstration, of, this, under, the, name, of, the, method, of, first, and, last, ratios, and, explained, why, he, put, his, expositions, in, this, form, remarking, also, that, hereby, the, same, thing, is, performed, as, by, the, method, of, indivisibles, because, of, this, the, principia, has, been, called, a, book, dense, with, the, theory, and, application, of, the, infinitesimal, calculus, in, modern, times, and, in, newton, s, time, nearly, all, of, it, is, of, this, calculus, his, use, of, methods, involving, one, or, more, orders, of, the, infinitesimally, small, is, present, in, his, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, of, 1684, and, in, his, papers, on, motion, during, the, two, decades, preceding, 1684, newton, had, been, reluctant, to, publish, his, calculus, because, he, feared, controversy, and, criticism, he, was, close, to, the, swiss, mathematician, nicolas, fatio, de, duillier, in, 1691, duillier, started, to, write, a, new, version, of, newton, s, principia, and, corresponded, with, leibniz, in, 1693, the, relationship, between, duillier, and, newton, deteriorated, and, the, book, was, never, completed, starting, in, 1699, other, members, of, the, royal, society, accused, leibniz, of, plagiarism, the, dispute, then, broke, out, in, full, force, in, 1711, when, the, royal, society, proclaimed, in, a, study, that, it, was, newton, who, was, the, true, discoverer, and, labelled, leibniz, a, fraud, it, was, later, found, that, newton, wrote, the, study, s, concluding, remarks, on, leibniz, thus, began, the, bitter, controversy, which, marred, the, lives, of, both, newton, and, leibniz, until, the, latter, s, death, in, 1716, newton, is, generally, credited, with, the, generalised, binomial, theorem, valid, for, any, exponent, he, discovered, newton, s, identities, newton, s, method, classified, cubic, plane, curves, polynomials, of, degree, three, in, two, variables, made, substantial, contributions, to, the, theory, of, finite, differences, and, was, the, first, to, use, fractional, indices, and, to, employ, coordinate, geometry, to, derive, solutions, to, diophantine, equations, he, approximated, partial, sums, of, the, harmonic, series, by, logarithms, a, precursor, to, euler, s, summation, formula, and, was, the, first, to, use, power, series, with, confidence, and, to, revert, power, series, newton, s, work, on, infinite, series, was, inspired, by, simon, stevin, s, decimals, in, 1666, newton, observed, that, the, spectrum, of, colours, exiting, a, prism, in, the, position, of, minimum, deviation, is, oblong, even, when, the, light, ray, entering, the, prism, is, circular, which, is, to, say, the, prism, refracts, different, colours, by, different, angles, this, led, him, to, conclude, that, colour, is, a, property, intrinsic, to, light, a, point, which, had, until, then, been, a, matter, of, debate, from, 1670, to, 1672, newton, lectured, on, optics, during, this, period, he, investigated, the, refraction, of, light, demonstrating, that, the, multicoloured, image, produced, by, a, prism, which, he, named, a, spectrum, could, be, recomposed, into, white, light, by, a, lens, and, a, second, prism, modern, scholarship, has, revealed, that, newton, s, analysis, and, resynthesis, of, white, light, owes, a, debt, to, corpuscular, alchemy, he, showed, that, coloured, light, does, not, change, its, properties, by, separating, out, a, coloured, beam, and, shining, it, on, various, objects, and, that, regardless, of, whether, reflected, scattered, or, transmitted, the, light, remains, the, same, colour, thus, he, observed, that, colour, is, the, result, of, objects, interacting, with, already, coloured, light, rather, than, objects, generating, the, colour, themselves, this, is, known, as, newton, s, theory, of, colour, from, this, work, he, concluded, that, the, lens, of, any, refracting, telescope, would, suffer, from, the, dispersion, of, light, into, colours, chromatic, aberration, as, a, proof, of, the, concept, he, constructed, a, telescope, using, reflective, mirrors, instead, of, lenses, as, the, objective, to, bypass, that, problem, building, the, design, the, first, known, functional, reflecting, telescope, today, known, as, a, newtonian, telescope, involved, solving, the, problem, of, a, suitable, mirror, material, and, shaping, technique, newton, ground, his, own, mirrors, out, of, a, custom, composition, of, highly, reflective, speculum, metal, using, newton, s, rings, to, judge, the, quality, of, the, optics, for, his, telescopes, in, late, 1668, he, was, able, to, produce, this, first, reflecting, telescope, it, was, about, eight, inches, long, and, it, gave, a, clearer, and, larger, image, in, 1671, the, royal, society, asked, for, a, demonstration, of, his, reflecting, telescope, their, interest, encouraged, him, to, publish, his, notes, of, colours, which, he, later, expanded, into, the, work, opticks, when, robert, hooke, criticised, some, of, newton, s, ideas, newton, was, so, offended, that, he, withdrew, from, public, debate, newton, and, hooke, had, brief, exchanges, in, 1679, 80, when, hooke, appointed, to, manage, the, royal, society, s, correspondence, opened, up, a, correspondence, intended, to, elicit, contributions, from, newton, to, royal, society, transactions, which, had, the, effect, of, stimulating, newton, to, work, out, a, proof, that, the, elliptical, form, of, planetary, orbits, would, result, from, a, centripetal, force, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, radius, vector, but, the, two, men, remained, generally, on, poor, terms, until, hooke, s, death, newton, argued, that, light, is, composed, of, particles, or, corpuscles, which, were, refracted, by, accelerating, into, a, denser, medium, he, verged, on, soundlike, waves, to, explain, the, repeated, pattern, of, reflection, and, transmission, by, thin, films, opticks, bk, ii, props, 12, but, still, retained, his, theory, of, fits, that, disposed, corpuscles, to, be, reflected, or, transmitted, props, 13, however, later, physicists, favoured, a, purely, wavelike, explanation, of, light, to, account, for, the, interference, patterns, and, the, general, phenomenon, of, diffraction, today, s, quantum, mechanics, photons, and, the, idea, of, wave, particle, duality, bear, only, a, minor, resemblance, to, newton, s, understanding, of, light, in, his, hypothesis, of, light, of, 1675, newton, posited, the, existence, of, the, ether, to, transmit, forces, between, particles, the, contact, with, the, cambridge, platonist, philosopher, henry, more, revived, his, interest, in, alchemy, he, replaced, the, ether, with, occult, forces, based, on, hermetic, ideas, of, attraction, and, repulsion, between, particles, john, maynard, keynes, who, acquired, many, of, newton, s, writings, on, alchemy, stated, that, newton, was, not, the, first, of, the, age, of, reason, he, was, the, last, of, the, magicians, newton, s, contributions, to, science, cannot, be, isolated, from, his, interest, in, alchemy, this, was, at, a, time, when, there, was, no, clear, distinction, between, alchemy, and, science, in, 1704, newton, published, opticks, in, which, he, expounded, his, corpuscular, theory, of, light, he, considered, light, to, be, made, up, of, extremely, subtle, corpuscles, that, ordinary, matter, was, made, of, grosser, corpuscles, and, speculated, that, through, a, kind, of, alchemical, transmutation, are, not, gross, bodies, and, light, convertible, into, one, another, and, may, not, bodies, receive, much, of, their, activity, from, the, particles, of, light, which, enter, their, composition, newton, also, constructed, a, primitive, form, of, a, frictional, electrostatic, generator, using, a, glass, globe, in, his, book, opticks, newton, was, the, first, to, show, a, diagram, using, a, prism, as, a, beam, expander, and, also, the, use, of, multiple, prism, arrays, some, 278, years, after, newton, s, discussion, multiple, prism, beam, expanders, became, central, to, the, development, of, narrow, linewidth, tunable, lasers, also, the, use, of, these, prismatic, beam, expanders, led, to, the, multiple, prism, dispersion, theory, subsequent, to, newton, much, has, been, amended, young, and, fresnel, discarded, newton, s, particle, theory, in, favour, of, huygens, wave, theory, to, show, that, colour, is, the, visible, manifestation, of, light, s, wavelength, science, also, slowly, came, to, realise, the, difference, between, perception, of, colour, and, mathematisable, optics, the, german, poet, and, scientist, goethe, could, not, shake, the, newtonian, foundation, but, one, hole, goethe, did, find, in, newton, s, armour, newton, had, committed, himself, to, the, doctrine, that, refraction, without, colour, was, impossible, he, therefore, thought, that, the, object, glasses, of, telescopes, must, forever, remain, imperfect, achromatism, and, refraction, being, incompatible, this, inference, was, proved, by, dollond, to, be, wrong, newton, had, been, developing, his, theory, of, gravitation, as, far, back, as, 1665, in, 1679, newton, returned, to, his, work, on, celestial, mechanics, by, considering, gravitation, and, its, effect, on, the, orbits, of, planets, with, reference, to, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, this, followed, stimulation, by, a, brief, exchange, of, letters, in, 1679, 80, with, hooke, who, had, been, appointed, secretary, of, the, royal, society, and, who, opened, a, correspondence, intended, to, elicit, contributions, from, newton, to, royal, society, transactions, newton, s, reawakening, interest, in, astronomical, matters, received, further, stimulus, by, the, appearance, of, a, comet, in, the, winter, of, 1680, 1681, on, which, he, corresponded, with, john, flamsteed, after, the, exchanges, with, hooke, newton, worked, out, a, proof, that, the, elliptical, form, of, planetary, orbits, would, result, from, a, centripetal, force, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, radius, vector, newton, communicated, his, results, to, edmond, halley, and, to, the, royal, society, in, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, a, tract, written, on, about, nine, sheets, which, was, copied, into, the, royal, society, s, register, book, in, december, 1684, this, tract, contained, the, nucleus, that, newton, developed, and, expanded, to, form, the, principia, the, principia, was, published, on, 5, july, 1687, with, encouragement, and, financial, help, from, halley, in, this, work, newton, stated, the, three, universal, laws, of, motion, together, these, laws, describe, the, relationship, between, any, object, the, forces, acting, upon, it, and, the, resulting, motion, laying, the, foundation, for, classical, mechanics, they, contributed, to, many, advances, during, the, industrial, revolution, which, soon, followed, and, were, not, improved, upon, for, more, than, 200, years, many, of, these, advances, continue, to, be, the, underpinnings, of, non, relativistic, technologies, in, the, modern, world, he, used, the, latin, word, gravitas, weight, for, the, effect, that, would, become, known, as, gravity, and, defined, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, in, the, same, work, newton, presented, a, calculus, like, method, of, geometrical, analysis, using, first, and, last, ratios, gave, the, first, analytical, determination, based, on, boyle, s, law, of, the, speed, of, sound, in, air, inferred, the, oblateness, of, earth, s, spheroidal, figure, accounted, for, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, as, a, result, of, the, moon, s, gravitational, attraction, on, the, earth, s, oblateness, initiated, the, gravitational, study, of, the, irregularities, in, the, motion, of, the, moon, provided, a, theory, for, the, determination, of, the, orbits, of, comets, and, much, more, newton, s, biographer, david, brewster, reported, that, the, complexity, of, applying, his, theory, of, gravity, to, the, motion, of, the, moon, was, so, great, it, affected, newton, s, health, e, was, deprived, of, his, appetite, and, sleep, during, his, work, on, the, problem, in, 1692, 93, and, told, the, astronomer, john, machin, that, his, head, never, ached, but, when, he, was, studying, the, subject, according, to, brewster, edmund, halley, also, told, john, conduitt, that, when, pressed, to, complete, his, analysis, newton, always, replied, that, it, made, his, head, ache, and, kept, him, awake, so, often, that, he, would, think, of, it, no, more, newton, made, clear, his, heliocentric, view, of, the, solar, system, developed, in, a, somewhat, modern, way, because, already, in, the, mid, 1680s, he, recognised, the, deviation, of, the, sun, from, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, solar, system, for, newton, it, was, not, precisely, the, centre, of, the, sun, or, any, other, body, that, could, be, considered, at, rest, but, rather, the, common, centre, of, gravity, of, the, earth, the, sun, and, all, the, planets, is, to, be, esteem, d, the, centre, of, the, world, and, this, centre, of, gravity, either, is, at, rest, or, moves, uniformly, forward, in, a, right, line, newton, adopted, the, at, rest, alternative, in, view, of, common, consent, that, the, centre, wherever, it, was, was, at, rest, newton, was, criticised, for, introducing, occult, agencies, into, science, because, of, his, postulate, of, an, invisible, force, able, to, act, over, vast, distances, later, in, the, second, edition, of, the, principia, 1713, newton, firmly, rejected, such, criticisms, in, a, concluding, general, scholium, writing, that, it, was, enough, that, the, phenomena, implied, a, gravitational, attraction, as, they, did, but, they, did, not, so, far, indicate, its, cause, and, it, was, both, unnecessary, and, improper, to, frame, hypotheses, of, things, that, were, not, implied, by, the, phenomena, here, newton, used, what, became, his, famous, expression, hypotheses, non, fingo, with, the, principia, newton, became, internationally, recognised, he, acquired, a, circle, of, admirers, including, the, swiss, born, mathematician, nicolas, fatio, de, duillier, in, 1710, newton, found, 72, of, the, 78, species, of, cubic, curves, and, categorised, them, into, four, types, in, 1717, and, probably, with, newton, s, help, james, stirling, proved, that, every, cubic, was, one, of, these, four, types, newton, also, claimed, that, the, four, types, could, be, obtained, by, plane, projection, from, one, of, them, and, this, was, proved, in, 1731, four, years, after, his, death, in, the, 1690s, newton, wrote, a, number, of, religious, tracts, dealing, with, the, literal, and, symbolic, interpretation, of, the, bible, a, manuscript, newton, sent, to, john, locke, in, which, he, disputed, the, fidelity, of, 1, john, 5, 7, the, johannine, comma, and, its, fidelity, to, the, original, manuscripts, of, the, new, testament, remained, unpublished, until, 1785, newton, was, also, a, member, of, the, parliament, of, england, for, cambridge, university, in, 1689, and, 1701, but, according, to, some, accounts, his, only, comments, were, to, complain, about, a, cold, draught, in, the, chamber, and, request, that, the, window, be, closed, he, was, however, noted, by, cambridge, diarist, abraham, de, la, pryme, to, have, rebuked, students, who, were, frightening, locals, by, claiming, that, a, house, was, haunted, newton, moved, to, london, to, take, up, the, post, of, warden, of, the, royal, mint, during, the, reign, of, king, william, iii, in, 1696, a, position, that, he, had, obtained, through, the, patronage, of, charles, montagu, 1st, earl, of, halifax, then, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, he, took, charge, of, england, s, great, recoining, trod, on, the, toes, of, lord, lucas, governor, of, the, tower, and, secured, the, job, of, deputy, comptroller, of, the, temporary, chester, branch, for, edmond, halley, newton, became, perhaps, the, best, known, master, of, the, mint, upon, the, death, of, thomas, neale, in, 1699, a, position, newton, held, for, the, last, 30, years, of, his, life, these, appointments, were, intended, as, sinecures, but, newton, took, them, seriously, he, retired, from, his, cambridge, duties, in, 1701, and, exercised, his, authority, to, reform, the, currency, and, punish, clippers, and, counterfeiters, as, warden, and, afterwards, as, master, of, the, royal, mint, newton, estimated, that, 20, percent, of, the, coins, taken, in, during, the, great, recoinage, of, 1696, were, counterfeit, counterfeiting, was, high, treason, punishable, by, the, felon, being, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, despite, this, convicting, even, the, most, flagrant, criminals, could, be, extremely, difficult, but, newton, proved, equal, to, the, task, disguised, as, a, habitu, of, bars, and, taverns, he, gathered, much, of, that, evidence, himself, for, all, the, barriers, placed, to, prosecution, and, separating, the, branches, of, government, english, law, still, had, ancient, and, formidable, customs, of, authority, newton, had, himself, made, a, justice, of, the, peace, in, all, the, home, counties, a, draft, letter, regarding, the, matter, is, included, in, newton, s, personal, first, edition, of, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, which, he, must, have, been, amending, at, the, time, then, he, conducted, more, than, 100, cross, examinations, of, witnesses, informers, and, suspects, between, june, 1698, and, christmas, 1699, newton, successfully, prosecuted, 28, coiners, newton, was, made, president, of, the, royal, society, in, 1703, and, an, associate, of, the, french, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, his, position, at, the, royal, society, newton, made, an, enemy, of, john, flamsteed, the, astronomer, royal, by, prematurely, publishing, flamsteed, s, historia, coelestis, britannica, which, newton, had, used, in, his, studies, in, april, 1705, queen, anne, knighted, newton, during, a, royal, visit, to, trinity, college, cambridge, the, knighthood, is, likely, to, have, been, motivated, by, political, considerations, connected, with, the, parliamentary, election, in, may, 1705, rather, than, any, recognition, of, newton, s, scientific, work, or, services, as, master, of, the, mint, newton, was, the, second, scientist, to, be, knighted, after, francis, bacon, as, a, result, of, a, report, written, by, newton, on, 21, september, 1717, to, the, lords, commissioners, of, his, majesty, s, treasury, the, bimetallic, relationship, between, gold, coins, and, silver, coins, was, changed, by, royal, proclamation, on, 22, december, 1717, forbidding, the, exchange, of, gold, guineas, for, more, than, 21, silver, shillings, this, inadvertently, resulted, in, a, silver, shortage, as, silver, coins, were, used, to, pay, for, imports, while, exports, were, paid, for, in, gold, effectively, moving, britain, from, the, silver, standard, to, its, first, gold, standard, it, is, a, matter, of, debate, as, to, whether, he, intended, to, do, this, or, not, it, has, been, argued, that, newton, conceived, of, his, work, at, the, mint, as, a, continuation, of, his, alchemical, work, newton, was, invested, in, the, south, sea, company, and, lost, some, 20, 000, 4, 4, million, in, 2020, when, it, collapsed, in, around, 1720, toward, the, end, of, his, life, newton, took, up, residence, at, cranbury, park, near, winchester, with, his, niece, and, her, husband, until, his, death, his, half, niece, catherine, barton, served, as, his, hostess, in, social, affairs, at, his, house, on, jermyn, street, in, london, he, was, her, very, loving, uncle, according, to, his, letter, to, her, when, she, was, recovering, from, smallpox, newton, died, in, his, sleep, in, london, on, 20, march, 1727, os, 20, march, 1726, ns, 31, march, 1727, he, was, given, a, ceremonial, funeral, attended, by, nobles, scientists, and, philosophers, and, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, among, kings, and, queens, he, was, the, first, scientist, to, be, buried, in, the, abbey, voltaire, may, have, been, present, at, his, funeral, a, bachelor, he, had, divested, much, of, his, estate, to, relatives, during, his, last, years, and, died, intestate, his, papers, went, to, john, conduitt, and, catherine, barton, shortly, after, his, death, a, plaster, death, mask, was, moulded, of, newton, it, was, used, by, flemish, sculptor, john, michael, rysbrack, in, making, a, sculpture, of, newton, it, is, now, held, by, the, royal, society, who, created, a, 3d, scan, of, it, in, 2012, newton, s, hair, was, posthumously, examined, and, found, to, contain, mercury, probably, resulting, from, his, alchemical, pursuits, mercury, poisoning, could, explain, newton, s, eccentricity, in, late, life, although, it, was, claimed, that, he, was, once, engaged, newton, never, married, the, french, writer, and, philosopher, voltaire, who, was, in, london, at, the, time, of, newton, s, funeral, said, that, he, was, never, sensible, to, any, passion, was, not, subject, to, the, common, frailties, of, mankind, nor, had, any, commerce, with, women, a, circumstance, which, was, assured, me, by, the, physician, and, surgeon, who, attended, him, in, his, last, moments, there, exists, a, widespread, belief, that, newton, died, a, virgin, and, writers, as, diverse, as, mathematician, charles, hutton, economist, john, maynard, keynes, and, physicist, carl, sagan, have, commented, on, it, newton, had, a, close, friendship, with, the, swiss, mathematician, nicolas, fatio, de, duillier, whom, he, met, in, london, around, 1689, some, of, their, correspondence, has, survived, their, relationship, came, to, an, abrupt, and, unexplained, end, in, 1693, and, at, the, same, time, newton, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, which, included, sending, wild, accusatory, letters, to, his, friends, samuel, pepys, and, john, locke, his, note, to, the, latter, included, the, charge, that, locke, had, endeavoured, to, embroil, him, with, woemen, by, other, means, newton, was, relatively, modest, about, his, achievements, writing, in, a, letter, to, robert, hooke, in, february, 1676, if, i, have, seen, further, it, is, by, standing, on, the, shoulders, of, giants, two, writers, think, that, the, sentence, written, at, a, time, when, newton, and, hooke, were, in, dispute, over, optical, discoveries, was, an, oblique, attack, on, hooke, said, to, have, been, short, and, hunchbacked, rather, than, or, in, addition, to, a, statement, of, modesty, on, the, other, hand, the, widely, known, proverb, about, standing, on, the, shoulders, of, giants, published, among, others, by, seventeenth, century, poet, george, herbert, a, former, orator, of, the, university, of, cambridge, and, fellow, of, trinity, college, in, his, jacula, prudentum, 1651, had, as, its, main, point, that, a, dwarf, on, a, giant, s, shoulders, sees, farther, of, the, two, and, so, its, effect, as, an, analogy, would, place, newton, himself, rather, than, hooke, as, the, dwarf, in, a, later, memoir, newton, wrote, i, do, not, know, what, i, may, appear, to, the, world, but, to, myself, i, seem, to, have, been, only, like, a, boy, playing, on, the, sea, shore, and, diverting, myself, in, now, and, then, finding, a, smoother, pebble, or, a, prettier, shell, than, ordinary, whilst, the, great, ocean, of, truth, lay, all, undiscovered, before, me, although, born, into, an, anglican, family, by, his, thirties, newton, held, a, christian, faith, that, had, it, been, made, public, would, not, have, been, considered, orthodox, by, mainstream, christianity, with, one, historian, labelling, him, a, heretic, by, 1672, he, had, started, to, record, his, theological, researches, in, notebooks, which, he, showed, to, no, one, and, which, have, only, been, available, for, public, examination, since, 1972, over, half, of, what, newton, wrote, concerned, theology, and, alchemy, and, most, has, never, been, printed, his, writings, demonstrate, an, extensive, knowledge, of, early, church, writings, and, show, that, in, the, conflict, between, athanasius, and, arius, which, defined, the, creed, he, took, the, side, of, arius, the, loser, who, rejected, the, conventional, view, of, the, trinity, newton, recognized, christ, as, a, divine, mediator, between, god, and, man, who, was, subordinate, to, the, father, who, created, him, he, was, especially, interested, in, prophecy, but, for, him, the, great, apostasy, was, trinitarianism, newton, tried, unsuccessfully, to, obtain, one, of, the, two, fellowships, that, exempted, the, holder, from, the, ordination, requirement, at, the, last, moment, in, 1675, he, received, a, dispensation, from, the, government, that, excused, him, and, all, future, holders, of, the, lucasian, chair, in, newton, s, eyes, worshipping, christ, as, god, was, idolatry, to, him, the, fundamental, sin, in, 1999, historian, stephen, d, snobelen, wrote, isaac, newton, was, a, heretic, but, he, never, made, a, public, declaration, of, his, private, faith, which, the, orthodox, would, have, deemed, extremely, radical, he, hid, his, faith, so, well, that, scholars, are, still, unraveling, his, personal, beliefs, snobelen, concludes, that, newton, was, at, least, a, socinian, sympathiser, he, owned, and, had, thoroughly, read, at, least, eight, socinian, books, possibly, an, arian, and, almost, certainly, an, anti, trinitarian, although, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, became, newton, s, best, known, discoveries, he, warned, against, using, them, to, view, the, universe, as, a, mere, machine, as, if, akin, to, a, great, clock, he, said, so, then, gravity, may, put, the, planets, into, motion, but, without, the, divine, power, it, could, never, put, them, into, such, a, circulating, motion, as, they, have, about, the, sun, along, with, his, scientific, fame, newton, s, studies, of, the, bible, and, of, the, early, church, fathers, were, also, noteworthy, newton, wrote, works, on, textual, criticism, most, notably, an, historical, account, of, two, notable, corruptions, of, scripture, and, observations, upon, the, prophecies, of, daniel, and, the, apocalypse, of, st, john, he, placed, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, christ, at, 3, april, ad, 33, which, agrees, with, one, traditionally, accepted, date, he, believed, in, a, rationally, immanent, world, but, he, rejected, the, hylozoism, implicit, in, leibniz, and, baruch, spinoza, the, ordered, and, dynamically, informed, universe, could, be, understood, and, must, be, understood, by, an, active, reason, in, his, correspondence, newton, claimed, that, in, writing, the, principia, i, had, an, eye, upon, such, principles, as, might, work, with, considering, men, for, the, belief, of, a, deity, he, saw, evidence, of, design, in, the, system, of, the, world, such, a, wonderful, uniformity, in, the, planetary, system, must, be, allowed, the, effect, of, choice, but, newton, insisted, that, divine, intervention, would, eventually, be, required, to, reform, the, system, due, to, the, slow, growth, of, instabilities, for, this, leibniz, lampooned, him, god, almighty, wants, to, wind, up, his, watch, from, time, to, time, otherwise, it, would, cease, to, move, he, had, not, it, seems, sufficient, foresight, to, make, it, a, perpetual, motion, newton, s, position, was, vigorously, defended, by, his, follower, samuel, clarke, in, a, famous, correspondence, a, century, later, pierre, simon, laplace, s, work, celestial, mechanics, had, a, natural, explanation, for, why, the, planet, orbits, do, not, require, periodic, divine, intervention, the, contrast, between, laplace, s, mechanistic, worldview, and, newton, s, one, is, the, most, strident, considering, the, famous, answer, which, the, french, scientist, gave, napoleon, who, had, criticised, him, for, the, absence, of, the, creator, in, the, m, canique, c, leste, sire, j, ai, pu, me, passer, de, cette, hypoth, se, sir, i, didn, t, need, this, hypothesis, scholars, long, debated, whether, newton, disputed, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, his, first, biographer, david, brewster, who, compiled, his, manuscripts, interpreted, newton, as, questioning, the, veracity, of, some, passages, used, to, support, the, trinity, but, never, denying, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, as, such, in, the, twentieth, century, encrypted, manuscripts, written, by, newton, and, bought, by, john, maynard, keynes, among, others, were, deciphered, and, it, became, known, that, newton, did, indeed, reject, trinitarianism, newton, and, robert, boyle, s, approach, to, the, mechanical, philosophy, was, promoted, by, rationalist, pamphleteers, as, a, viable, alternative, to, the, pantheists, and, enthusiasts, and, was, accepted, hesitantly, by, orthodox, preachers, as, well, as, dissident, preachers, like, the, latitudinarians, the, clarity, and, simplicity, of, science, was, seen, as, a, way, to, combat, the, emotional, and, metaphysical, superlatives, of, both, superstitious, enthusiasm, and, the, threat, of, atheism, and, at, the, same, time, the, second, wave, of, english, deists, used, newton, s, discoveries, to, demonstrate, the, possibility, of, a, natural, religion, the, attacks, made, against, pre, enlightenment, magical, thinking, and, the, mystical, elements, of, christianity, were, given, their, foundation, with, boyle, s, mechanical, conception, of, the, universe, newton, gave, boyle, s, ideas, their, completion, through, mathematical, proofs, and, perhaps, more, importantly, was, very, successful, in, popularising, them, newton, was, not, the, first, of, the, age, of, reason, he, was, the, last, of, the, magicians, the, last, of, the, babylonians, and, sumerians, the, last, great, mind, which, looked, out, on, the, visible, and, intellectual, world, with, the, same, eyes, as, those, who, began, to, build, our, intellectual, inheritance, rather, less, than, 10, 000, years, ago, isaac, newton, a, posthumous, child, born, with, no, father, on, christmas, day, 1642, was, the, last, wonderchild, to, whom, the, magi, could, do, sincere, and, appropriate, homage, john, maynard, keynes, newton, the, man, of, an, estimated, ten, million, words, of, writing, in, newton, s, papers, about, one, million, deal, with, alchemy, many, of, newton, s, writings, on, alchemy, are, copies, of, other, manuscripts, with, his, own, annotations, alchemical, texts, mix, artisanal, knowledge, with, philosophical, speculation, often, hidden, behind, layers, of, wordplay, allegory, and, imagery, to, protect, craft, secrets, some, of, the, content, contained, in, newton, s, papers, could, have, been, considered, heretical, by, the, church, in, 1888, after, spending, sixteen, years, cataloguing, newton, s, papers, cambridge, university, kept, a, small, number, and, returned, the, rest, to, the, earl, of, portsmouth, in, 1936, a, descendant, offered, the, papers, for, sale, at, sotheby, s, the, collection, was, broken, up, and, sold, for, a, total, of, about, 9, 000, john, maynard, keynes, was, one, of, about, three, dozen, bidders, who, obtained, part, of, the, collection, at, auction, keynes, went, on, to, reassemble, an, estimated, half, of, newton, s, collection, of, papers, on, alchemy, before, donating, his, collection, to, cambridge, university, in, 1946, all, of, newton, s, known, writings, on, alchemy, are, currently, being, put, online, in, a, project, undertaken, by, indiana, university, the, chymistry, of, isaac, newton, and, summarised, in, a, book, newton, s, fundamental, contributions, to, science, include, the, quantification, of, gravitational, attraction, the, discovery, that, white, light, is, actually, a, mixture, of, immutable, spectral, colors, and, the, formulation, of, the, calculus, yet, there, is, another, more, mysterious, side, to, newton, that, is, imperfectly, known, a, realm, of, activity, that, spanned, some, thirty, years, of, his, life, although, he, kept, it, largely, hidden, from, his, contemporaries, and, colleagues, we, refer, to, newton, s, involvement, in, the, discipline, of, alchemy, or, as, it, was, often, called, in, seventeenth, century, england, chymistry, in, june, 2020, two, unpublished, pages, of, newton, s, notes, on, jan, baptist, van, helmont, s, book, on, plague, de, peste, were, being, auctioned, online, by, bonhams, newton, s, analysis, of, this, book, which, he, made, in, cambridge, while, protecting, himself, from, london, s, 1665, 1666, infection, is, the, most, substantial, written, statement, he, is, known, to, have, made, about, the, plague, according, to, bonhams, as, far, as, the, therapy, is, concerned, newton, writes, that, the, best, is, a, toad, suspended, by, the, legs, in, a, chimney, for, three, days, which, at, last, vomited, up, earth, with, various, insects, in, it, on, to, a, dish, of, yellow, wax, and, shortly, after, died, combining, powdered, toad, with, the, excretions, and, serum, made, into, lozenges, and, worn, about, the, affected, area, drove, away, the, contagion, and, drew, out, the, poison, the, mathematician, and, astronomer, joseph, louis, lagrange, frequently, asserted, that, newton, was, the, greatest, genius, who, ever, lived, and, once, added, that, newton, was, also, the, most, fortunate, for, we, cannot, find, more, than, once, a, system, of, the, world, to, establish, english, poet, alexander, pope, wrote, the, famous, epitaph, nature, and, nature, s, laws, lay, hid, in, night, god, said, let, newton, be, and, all, was, light, but, this, was, not,

comets, the, tides, of, the, sea, the, dissimilarities, in, rays, of, light, and, what, no, other, scholar, has, previously, imagined, the, properties, of, the, colours, thus, produced, diligent,

on, the, history, of, science, newton, or, albert, einstein, both, the, royal, society, members, and, the, public, deemed, newton, to, have, made, the, greater, overall, contributions, in, 1999, an, opinion, poll, of, 100, of, the, day, s, leading, physicists, voted, einstein, the, greatest, physicist, ever, with, newton, the, runner, up, while, a, parallel, survey, of, rank, and, file, physicists, by, the, site, physicsweb, gave, the, top, spot, to, newton, new, scientist, called, newton, the, supreme, genius, and, most, enigmatic, character, in, the, history, of, science, newton, has, been, called, the, most, influential, figure, in, the, history, of, western, science, einstein, kept, a, picture, of, newton, on, his, study, wall, alongside, ones, of, michael, faraday, and, james, clerk, maxwell, physicist, lev, landau, ranked, physicists, on, a, logarithmic, scale, of, productivity, ranging, from, 0, to, 5, the, highest, ranking, 0, was, assigned, to, newton, albert, einstein, was, ranked, 0, 5, a, rank, of, 1, was, awarded, to, the, founding, fathers, of, quantum, mechanics, niels, bohr, werner, heisenberg, paul, dirac, and, erwin, schr, dinger, landau, a, nobel,

to, have, belonged, to, newton, was, sold, for, 730, in, london, to, an, aristocrat, who, had, it, set, in, a, ring, guinness, world, records, 2002, classified, it, as, the, most, valuable, tooth, in, the, world, which, would, value, approximately, 25, 000, us, 35, 700, in, late, 2001, who, bought, it, and, who, currently, has, it, has, not, been, disclosed, newton, himself, often, told, the, story, that, he, was, inspired, to, formulate, his, theory, of, gravitation, by, watching, the, fall, of, an, apple, from, a, tree, the, story, is, believed, to, have, passed, into, popular, knowledge, after, being, related, by, catherine, barton, newton, s, niece, to, voltaire, voltaire, then, wrote, in, his, essay, on, epic, poetry, 1727, sir, isaac, newton, walking, in, his, gardens, had, the, first, thought, of, his, system, of, gravitation, upon, seeing, an, apple, falling, from, a, tree, although, it, has, been, said, that, the, apple, story, is, a, myth, and, that, he, did, not, arrive, at, his, theory, of, gravity, at, any, single, moment, acquaintances, of, newton, such, as, william, stukeley, whose, manuscript, account, of, 1752, has, been, made, available, by, the, royal, society, do, in, fact, confirm, the, incident, though, not, the, apocryphal, version, that, the, apple, actually, hit, newton, s, head, stukeley, recorded, in, his, memoirs, of, sir, isaac, newton, s, life, a, conversation, with, newton, in, kensington, on, 15, april, 1726, we, went, into, the, garden, drank, thea, under, the, shade, of, some, appletrees, only, he, myself, amidst, other, discourse, he, told, me, he, was, just, in, the, same, situation, as, when, formerly, the, notion, of, gravitation, came, into, his, mind, why, should, that, apple, always, descend, perpendicularly, to, the, ground, thought, he, to, him, self, occasion, d, by, the, fall, of, an, apple, as, he, sat, in, a, comtemplative, mood, why, should, it, not, go, sideways, or, upwards, but, constantly, to, the, earths, centre, assuredly, the, reason, is, that, the, earth, draws, it, there, must, be, a, drawing, power, in, matter, the, sum, of, the, drawing, power, in, the, matter, of, the, earth, must, be, in, the, earths, center, not, in, any, side, of, the, earth, therefore, dos, this, apple, fall, perpendicularly, or, toward, the, center, if, matter, thus, draws, matter, it, must, be, in, proportion, of, its, quantity, therefore, the, apple, draws, the, earth, as, well, as, the, earth, draws, the, apple, john, conduitt, newton, s, assistant, at, the, royal, mint, and, husband, of, newton, s, niece, also, described, the, event, when, he, wrote, about, newton, s, life, in, the, year, 1666, he, retired, again, from, cambridge, to, his, mother, in, lincolnshire, whilst, he, was, pensively, meandering, in, a, garden, it, came, into, his, thought, that, the, power, of, gravity, which, brought, an, apple, from, a, tree, to, the, ground, was, not, limited, to, a, certain, distance, from, earth, but, that, this, power, must, extend, much, further, than, was, usually, thought, why, not, as, high, as, the, moon, said, he, to, himself, if, so, that, must, influence, her, motion, perhaps, retain, her, in, her, orbit, whereupon, he, fell, a, calculating, what, would, be, the, effect, of, that, supposition, it, is, known, from, his, notebooks, that, newton, was, grappling, in, the, late, 1660s, with, the, idea, that, terrestrial, gravity, extends, in, an, inverse, square, proportion, to, the, moon, however, it, took, him, two, decades, to, develop, the, full, fledged, theory, the, question, was, not, whether, gravity, existed, but, whether, it, extended, so, far, from, earth, that, it, could, also, be, the, force, holding, the, moon, to, its, orbit, newton, showed, that, if, the, force, decreased, as, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, one, could, indeed, calculate, the, moon, s, orbital, period, and, get, good, agreement, he, guessed, the, same, force, was, responsible, for, other, orbital, motions, and, hence, named, it, universal, gravitation, various, trees, are, claimed, to, be, the, apple, tree, which, newton, describes, the, king, s, school, grantham, claims, that, the, tree, was, purchased, by, the, school, uprooted, and, transported, to, the, headmaster, s, garden, some, years, later, the, staff, of, the, now, national, trust, owned, woolsthorpe, manor, dispute, this, and, claim, that, a, tree, present, in, their, gardens, is, the, one, described, by, newton, a, descendant, of, the, original, tree, can, be, seen, growing, outside, the, main, gate, of, trinity, college, cambridge, below, the, room, newton, lived, in, when, he, studied, there, the, national, fruit, collection, at, brogdale, in, kent, can, supply, grafts, from, their, tree, which, appears, identical, to, flower, of, kent, a, coarse, fleshed, cooking, variety, newton, s, monument, 1731, can, be, seen, in, westminster, abbey, at, the, north, of, the, entrance, to, the, choir, against, the, choir, screen, near, his, tomb, it, was, executed, by, the, sculptor, michael, rysbrack, 1694, 1770, in, white, and, grey, marble, with, design, by, the, architect, william, kent, the, monument, features, a, figure, of, newton, reclining, on, top, of, a, sarcophagus, his, right, elbow, resting, on, several, of, his, great, books, and, his, left, hand, pointing, to, a, scroll, with, a, mathematical, design, above, him, is, a, pyramid, and, a, celestial, globe, showing, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, and, the, path, of, the, comet, of, 1680, a, relief, panel, depicts, putti, using, instruments, such, as, a, telescope, and, prism, from, 1978, until, 1988, an, image, of, newton, designed, by, harry, ecclestone, appeared, on, series, d, 1, banknotes, issued, by, the, bank, of, england, the, last, 1, notes, to, be, issued, by, the, bank, of, england, newton, was, shown, on, the, reverse, of, the, notes, holding, a, book, and, accompanied, by, a, telescope, a, prism, and, a, map, of, the, solar, system, a, statue, of, isaac, newton, looking, at, an, apple, at, his, feet, can, be, seen, at, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, a, large, bronze, statue, newton, after, william, blake, by, eduardo, paolozzi, dated, 1995, and, inspired, by, blake, s, etching, dominates, the, piazza, of, the, british, library, in, london, a, bronze, statue, of, newton, was, erected, in, 1858, in, the, centre, of, grantham, where, he, went, to, school, prominently, standing, in, front, of, grantham, guildhall, the, still, surviving, farmhouse, at, woolsthorpe, by, colsterworth, is, a, grade, i, listed, building, by, historic, england, through, being, his, birthplace, and, where, he, discovered, gravity, and,

guides, and, guarantors, of, their, applications, of, the, singular, concept, of, nature, and, natural, law, to, every, physical, and, social, field, of, the, day, in, this, respect, the, lessons, of, history, and, the, social, structures, built, upon, it, could, be, discarded, it, is, held, by, european, philosophers, of, the, enlightenment, and, by, historians, of, the, enlightenment, that, newton, s, publication, of, the, principia, was, a, turning, point, in, the, scientific, revolution, and, started, the, enlightenment, it, was, newton, s, conception, of, the, universe, based, upon, natural, and, rationally, understandable, laws, that, became, one, of, the, seeds, for, enlightenment, ideology, locke, and, voltaire, applied, concepts, of, natural, law, to, political, systems, advocating, intrinsic, rights, the, physiocrats, and, adam, smith, applied, natural, conceptions, of, psychology, and, self, interest, to, economic, systems, and, sociologists, criticised, the, current, social, order, for, trying, to, fit, history, into, natural, models, of, progress, monboddo, and, samuel, clarke, resisted, elements, of, newton, s, work, but, eventually, rationalised, it,
