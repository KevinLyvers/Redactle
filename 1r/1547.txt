star, line, with, garvey, discharging, two, of, them, richard, e, warner, and, edgar, m, grey, and, publicly, humiliating, them, at, the, next, unia, meeting, people, continued, buying, stock,

world, his, comments, in, jamaica, earned, many, enemies, who, criticized, him, on, multiple, fronts, including, the, fact, he, had, left, his, destitute, father, to, die, in, an, almshouse, attacks, back, and, forth, between, garvey, and, his, critics, appeared, in, the, letters, published, by, the, gleaner, from, jamaica, garvey, traveled, to, costa, rica, where, the, united, fruit, company, assisted, his, transportation, around, the, country, hoping, to, gain, his, favor, there, he, met, with, president, julio, acosta, arriving, in, panama, at, one, of, his, first, speeches, in, almirante, he, was, booed, after, doubling, the, advertised, entry, price, his, response, was, to, call, the, crowd, a, bunch, of, ignorant, and, impertinent, negroes, no, wonder, you, are, where, you, are, and, for, my, part, you, can, stay, where, you, are, he, received, a, far, warmer, reception, at, panama, city, after, which, he, sailed, to, kingston, from, there, he, sought, a, return,

further, garvey, spoke, out, against, the, charges, he, faced, but, focused, on, blaming, not, the, state, but, rival, african, american, groups, for, them, as, well, as, accusing, disgruntled, former, members, of, unia, in, a, liberty, hall, speech, he, implied, that, the, naacp, were, behind, the, conspiracy, to, imprison, him, the, mainstream, press, picked, up, on, the, charge, largely, presenting, garvey, as, a, con, artist, who, had, swindled, african, american, people, after, his, arrest, garvey, announced, that, the, activities, of, the, bsl, were, being, suspended, he, also, made, plans, for, a, tour, of, the, western, and, southern, states, this, included, a, parade, in, los, angeles, partly, to, woo, back, members, of, unia, s, california, branch, which, had, recently,

klan, the, anglo, saxon, clubs, and, white, american, societies, as, far, as, the, negro, is, concerned, as, better, friends, of, the, race, than, all, other, groups, of, hypocritical, whites, put, together, i, like, honesty, and, fair, play, you, may, call, me, a, klansman, if, you, will, but, potentially, every, white, man, is, a, klansman, as, far, as, the, negro, in, competition, with, whites, socially, economically, and, politically, is, concerned, and, there, is, no, use, lying, news, of, garvey, s, meeting, with, the, kkk, soon, spread, and, it, was, covered, on, the, front, page, of, many, african, american, newspapers, causing, widespread, upset, when, news, of, the, meeting, was, revealed, it, generated, much, surprise, and, anger, among, african, americans, grant, noted, that, it, marked, the, most, significant, turning, point, in, his, popularity, several, prominent, black, americans, chandler, owen, a, philip, randolph, william, pickens, and, robert, bagnall, launched, the, garvey, must, go, campaign, in, the, wake, of, the, revelation, many, of, these, critics, played, to, nativist, ideas, by, emphasising, garvey, s, jamaican, identity, and, sometimes, calling, for, his, deportation, pickens, and, several, other, of, garvey, s, critics, claimed, to, have, been, threatened, and, sometimes, physically, attacked, by, garveyites, randolph, reported,

the, negro, improvement, association, he, believes, america, to, be, a, white, man, s, country, and, also, states, that, the, negro, should, have, a, country, of, his, own, in, africa, he, has, been, invited, to, speak, at, forthcoming, convention, to, further, assure, the, race, of, the, stand, of, the, klan, garvey, s, telegram, to, unia, hq, june, 1922, 1922, also, brought, some, successes, for, garvey, he, attracted, the, country, s, first, black, pilot, hubert, fauntleroy, julian, to, join, unia, and, to, perform, aerial, stunts, to, raise, its, profile, the, group, also, launched, its, booker, t, washington, university, from, the, unia, run, phyllis, wheatley, hotel, on, west, 136th, street, he, also, finally, succeeded, in, securing, a, unia, delegation, to, the, league, of, nations, sending, five, members, to, represent, the, group, to, geneva, garvey, also, proposed, marriage, to, his, secretary, jacques, she, accepted, although, later, stated, i, did, not, marry, for, love, i, did, not, love, garvey, i, married, him, because, i, thought, it, was, the, right, thing, to, do, they, married, in, baltimore, in, july, 1922, she, proposed, that, a, book, of, his, speeches, be, published, it, appeared, as, the, philosophy, and, opinions, of, marcus, garvey, although, the, speeches, were, edited, to, remove, more, inflammatory, material, that, year, unia, also, launched, a, new, newspaper, the, daily, negro, times, at, unia, s, august, 1922, convention, garvey, called, for, the, impeachment, of, several, senior, unia, figures, including, adrian, johnson, and, j, d, gibson, and, declared, that, the, unia, cabinet, should, not, be, elected, by, the, organization, s, members, but, appointed, directly, by, him, when, they, refused, to, step, down, he, resigned, both, as, head, of, unia, and, as, provisional, president, of, africa, probably, in, an, act, designed, to, compel, their, own, resignations, he, then, began, openly, criticising, another, senior, member, reverend, james, eason, and, succeeded, in, getting, him, expelled, from, unia, with, eason, gone, garvey, asked, the, rest, of, the, cabinet, to, resign, they, did, so, at, which, he, resumed, his, role, as, head, of, the, organization, in, september, eason, launched, a, rival, group, to, unia, the, universal, negro, alliance, in, january, 1923, eason, was, assassinated, by, garveyites, while, in, new, orleans, hoover, suspected, that, the, killing, had, been, ordered, by, senior, unia, members, although, garvey, publicly, denied, any, involvement, he, nevertheless, launched, a, defense, fund, campaign, for, eason, s, killers, following, the, murder, eight, prominent, african, americans, signed, a, public, letter, calling, garvey, an, unscrupulous, demagogue, who, has, ceaselessly, and, assiduously, sought, to, spread, among, negroes, distrust, and, hatred, of, all, white, people, they, urged, the, attorney, general, to, bring, forth, the, criminal, case, against, garvey, and, disband, unia, garvey, was, furious, publicly, accusing, them, of, the, greatest, bit, of, treachery, and, wickedness, that, any, group, of, negroes, could, be, capable, of, in, a, pamphlet, attacking, them, he, focused, on, their, racial, heritage, lambasting, the, eight, for, the, reason, that, nearly, all, octoroons, and, quadroons, du, bois, who, was, not, among, the, eight, then, wrote, an, article, critical, of, garvey, s, activities, in, the, u, s, garvey, responded, by, calling, du, bois, a, hater, of, dark, people, an, unfortunate, mulatto, who, bewails, every, drop, of, negro, blood, in, his, veins, having, been, postponed, at, least, three, times, in, may, 1923, the, trial, finally, came, to, court, with, garvey, and, three, other, defendants, accused, of, mail, fraud, the, judge, overseeing, the, proceedings, was, julian, mack, although, garvey, disliked, his, selection, on, the, grounds, that, he, thought, mack, an, naacp, sympathiser, at, the, start, of, the, trial, garvey, s, attorney, cornelius, mcdougald, urged, him, to, plead, guilty, to, secure, a, minimum, sentence, but, garvey, refused, dismissing, mcdougald, and, deciding, to, represent, himself, in, court, the, trial, proceeded, for, more, than, a, month, throughout, garvey, struggled, due, to, his, lack, of, legal, training, in, his, three, hour, closing, address, he, presented, himself, as, a, selfless, leader, who, was, beset, by, incompetent, and, thieving, staff, who, caused, all, the, problems, for, unia, and, the, black, star, line, on, 18, june, the, jurors, retired, to, deliberate, on, the, verdict, returning, after, ten, hours, they, found, garvey, himself, guilty, but, his, three, co, defendants, not, guilty, garvey, was, furious, with, the, verdict, shouting, abuse, in, the, courtroom, and, calling, both, the, judge, and, district, attorney, damned, dirty, jews, imprisoned, in, the, tombs, jail, while, awaiting, sentencing, he, continued, to, blame, a, jewish, cabal, for, the, verdict, in, contrast, prior, to, this, he, had, never, expressed, antisemitic, sentiment, and, was, supportive, of, zionism, when, it, came, to, sentencing, mack, sentenced, garvey, to, five, years, imprisonment, and, a, 1000, fine, the, severity, of, the, sentence, which, was, harsher, than, those, given, to, similar, crimes, at, the, time, may, have, been, a, response, to, garvey, s, antisemitic, outburst, he, felt, that, they, had, been, biased, because, of, their, political, objections, to, his, meeting, with, the, acting, imperial, wizard, of, the, ku, klux, klan, the, year, before, in, 1928, garvey, told, a, journalist, when, they, wanted, to, get, me, they, had, a, jewish, judge, try, me, and, a, jewish, prosecutor, i, would, have, been, freed, but, two, jews, on, the, jury, held, out, against, me, ten, hours, and, succeeded, in, convicting, me, whereupon, the, jewish, judge, gave, me, the, maximum, penalty, a, week, after, the, sentence,

and, there, was, a, growing, schism, between, its, caribbean, and, african, american, members, from, jail, garvey, continued, to, write, letters, and, articles, lashing, out, at, those, he, blamed, for, the, conviction, focusing, much, of, his, criticism, on, the, naacp, in, september, judge, martin, manton, awarded, garvey, bail, for, 15, 000, which, was, duly, raised, by, unia, while, he,

having, more, honesty, of, purpose, towards, the, negro, than, the, naacp, although, he, previously, avoided, involvement, with, party, politics, for, the, first, time, he, encouraged, unia, to, propose, candidates, in, elections, often, setting, them, against, naacp, backed, candidates, in, areas, with, high, black, populations, the, american, negro, has, endured, this, wretch, too, long,

with, its, ruling, elite, du, bois, denied, the, accusation, later, examination, suggested, that, despite, king, s, assurances, to, the, unia, team, the, liberian, government, had, never, seriously, intended, to, allow, african, american, colonization, aware, that, it, would, harm, relations, with, the, british, and, french, colonies, on, their, borders, who, feared, the, political, tensions, it,

oppression, of, the, race, in, their, efforts, in, the, direction, of, race, progress, eventually, coolidge, agreed, to, commute, the, sentence, so, that, it, would, expire, immediately, on, 18,

in, kingston, unia, obtained, edelweiss, park, in, cross, roads, which, it, established, as, its, new, headquarters, they, held, a, conference, there, opened, by, a, parade, through, the, city, which, attracted, tens, of, thousands, of, onlookers, at, edelweiss, park, unia, also, began, putting, on, plays, one, of, these, coronation, of, an, african, king, was, written, by, garvey, and, performed, in, august, 1930, its, plot, revolved, around, the, crowning, of, prince, cudjoe, of, sudan, although, it, anticipated, the, crowning, of, haile, selassie, of, ethiopia, later, that, year, in, jamaica, garvey, became, a, de, facto, surrogate, father, to, his, niece, ruth, whose, father, had, recently, died, in, september, 1930, his, first, son, marcus, garvey, iii, was, born, three, years, later, a, second, son, julius, followed, in, kingston, garvey, was, elected, a, city, councillor, and, established, the, country, s, first, political, party, the, people, s, political, party, ppp, through, which, he, intended, to, contest, the, forthcoming, legislative, council, election, in, september, 1929, he, addressed, a, crowd, of, 1, 500, supporters, launching, the, ppp, s, manifesto, which, included, land, reform, to, benefit, tenant, farmers, the, addition, of, a, minimum, wage, to, the, constitution, pledges, to, build, jamaica, s, first, university, and, opera, house, and, a, proposed, law, to, impeach, and, imprison, corrupt, judges, the, latter, policy, led, to, garvey, being, charged, with, demeaning, the, judiciary, and, undermining, public, confidence, in, it, he, pled, guilty, and, was, sentenced, to, three, months, in, a, spanish, town, prison, and, a, 100, fine, while, imprisoned, garvey, was, removed, from, the, kingston, council, by, other, councillors, garvey, was, furious, and, wrote, an, editorial, against, them, published, in, the, blackman, journal, this, resulted, in, his, being, charged, with, seditious, libel, for, which, he, was, convicted, and, sentenced, to, six, months, in, prison, his, conviction, was, then, overturned, on, appeal, he, then, campaigned, as, the, ppp, s, candidate, for, the, legislative, assembly, in, saint, andrew, parish, in, which, he, secured, 915, votes, being, defeated, by, george, seymour, jones, in, increasingly, strained, finances, amid, the, great, depression, garvey, began, working, as, an, auctioneer, and, by, 1935, was, supplementing, this, with, his, wife, s, savings, he, re, mortgaged, his, house, and, personal, properties, and, in, 1934, edelweiss, park, was, foreclosed, and, auctioned, off, dissatisfied, with, life, in, jamaica, garvey, decided, to, move, to, london, sailing, aboard, the, ss, tilapa, in, march, 1935, once, in, london, he, told, his, friend, amy, bailey, that, he, had, left, jamaica, a, broken, man, broken, in, spirit, broken, in, health, and, broken, in, pocket, and, i, will, never, never, never, go, back, in, london, garvey, sought, to, rebuild, unia, although, found, there, was, much, competition, in, the, city, from, other, black, activist, groups, he, established, a, new, unia, headquarters, in, beaumont, avenue, west, kensington, and, launched, a, new, monthly, journal, black, man, garvey, returned, to, speaking, at, speakers, corner, in, hyde, park, when, he, spoke, in, public, he, was, increasingly, harangued, by, socialists, for, his, conservative, stances, he, also, had, hopes, of, becoming, a, member, of, parliament, although, this, amounted, to, nothing, in, 1935, the, second, italo, ethiopian, war, broke, out, as, italy, invaded, ethiopia, garvey, spoke, out, against, the, italians, and, praised, the, government, of, haile, selassie, by, october, however, he, was, becoming, increasingly, critical, of, selassie, blaming, his, lack, of, preparedness, for, ethiopia, s, failures, in, the, war, when, selassie, fled, his, homeland, and, arrived, in, britain, garvey, was, among, the, black, delegates, who, arranged, to, meet, him, at, waterloo, station, but, was, rebuffed, from, that, point, he, became, more, openly, hostile, to, selassie, describing, him, as, a, feudal, monarch, who, looks, down, upon, his, slaves, and, serfs, with, contempt, and, a, great, coward, who, ran, away, from, his, country, to, save, his, skin, garvey, s, vocal, criticisms, of, selassie, further, ostracised, him, from, the, broader, black, activist, community, including, many, garveyites, most, of, whom, were, rallying, around, selassie, as, a, symbol, of, ethiopia, s, struggle, against, colonialism, in, june, 1937, garvey, s, wife, and, children, arrived, in, england, where, the, latter, were, sent, to, a, school, in, kensington, gardens, shortly, after, garvey, embarked, on, a, lecture, and, fundraising, tour, of, canada, and, the, caribbean, in, which, he, attended, the, annual, unia, convention, in, toronto, in, trinidad, he, openly, criticised, a, recent, oil, workers, strike, this, probably, exacerbated, tensions, between, him, and, two, prominent, trinidadian, marxists, then, living, in, london, c, l, r, james, and, george, padmore, once, he, had, returned, to, london, garvey, took, up, a, new, family, home, in, talgarth, road, not, far, from, unia, s, headquarters, in, public, debates, garvey, repeatedly, clashed, with, padmore, who, was, chair, of, the, international, african, service, bureau, in, the, summer, of, 1938, garvey, returned, to, toronto, for, the, next, unia, conference, while, garvey, was, gone, his, wife, and, sons, returned, to, jamaica, doctors, had, recommended, that, marcus, garvey, iii, be, moved, to, a, warm, climate, to, aid, with, his, severe, rheumatism, jacques, had, not, informed, her, husband, of, the, decision, when, garvey, returned, to, london, he, was, furious, with, his, wife, s, decision, garvey, was, increasingly, isolated, while, unia, was, running, out, of, funds, as, its, international, membership, dwindled, for, the, first, time, in, many, years, he, met, up, with, ashwood, who, was, also, living, in, london, in, january, 1940, garvey, suffered, a, stroke, which, left, him, largely, paralysed, his, secretary, daisy, whyte, took, on, responsibility, for, his, care, at, this, point, padmore, spread, rumours, of, garvey, s, death, this, led, to, many, newspapers, publishing, premature, obituaries, in, late, may, 1940, many, of, which, he, read, according, to, his, secretary, on, the, second, day, of, reading, through, his, pile, of, obituaries, garvey, suffered, another, massive, stroke, and, died, two, weeks, later, at, the, age, of, 52, on, 10, june, 1940, his, body, was, interred, in, a, vault, in, the, catacombs, of, the, chapel, of, st, mary, s, catholic, cemetery, in, kensal, green, west, london, various, wakes, and, memorials, were, held, for, garvey, especially, in, new, york, city, and, kingston, in, harlem, a, procession, of, mourners, paraded, to, his, memorial, service, some, garveyites, refused, to, believe, garvey, had, died, even, when, confronted, with, photographs, of, his, body, in, its, coffin, insisting, that, this, was, part, of, a, conspiracy, to, undermine, his, movement, both, ashwood, and, jacques, presented, themselves, as, the, widow, of, marcus, garvey, and, ashwood, launched, legal, action, against, jacques, in, an, attempt, to, secure, control, over, his, body, the, writer, richard, hart, later, noted, that, within, a, decade, of, his, death, a, veritable, cult, had, begun, to, grow, around, garvey, s, memory, in, jamaica, by, the, 1950s, jamaican, politicians, of, varied, ideological, backgrounds, were, invoking, his, name, leslie, alexander, a, kingston, real, estate, agent, proposed, the, removal, of, garvey, s, body, and, its, return, to, jamaica, alexander, s, campaign, was, successful, and, in, 1964, garvey, s, remains, were, exhumed, and, returned, to, jamaica, the, body, lay, in, state, at, holy, trinity, cathedral, in, kingston, and, thousands, of, visitors, came, for, a, viewing, his, body, was, then, reburied, in, king, george, vi, memorial, park, on, 22, november, 1964, with, pomp, and, ceremony, befitting, a, national, hero, numerous, foreign, diplomats, attended, the, monument, designed, by, g, c, hodges, consists, of, a, tomb, at, the, center, of, a, raised, platform, in, the, shape, of, a, black, star, a, symbol, often, used, by, garvey, behind, it, a, peaked, and, angled, wall, houses, a, bust, by, alvin, t, marriot, of, garvey, which, was, added, to, the, park, in, 1956, before, his, reinterment, and, relocated, after, the, construction, of, the, monument, ethiopia, thou, land, of, our, fathers, thou, land, where, the, gods, loved, to, be, as, storm, cloud, at, night, suddenly, gathers, our, armies, come, rushing, to, thee, we, must, in, the, fight, be, victorious, when, swords, are, thrust, outward, to, gleam, for, us, will, the, vict, ry, be, glorious, when, led, by, the, red, black, and, green, lyrics, from, the, unia, anthem, ideologically, garvey, was, a, black, nationalist, generally, referring, to, dark, skinned, peoples, of, african, descent, as, negroes, he, and, the, unia, insisted, that, that, term, should, be, capitalized, thus, affording, dignity, and, respect, to, those, whom, it, described, his, ideas, were, influenced, by, a, range, of, sources, according, to, grant, while, he, was, living, in, london, garvey, displayed, an, amazing, capacity, to, absorb, political, tracts, theories, of, social, engineering, african, history, and, the, western, enlightenment, garvey, was, exposed, to, the, ideas, about, race, that, were, prevalent, at, the, time, his, ideas, on, race, were, also, heavily, informed, by, the, writings, of, edward, wilmot, blyden, and, by, his, work, in, london, with, dus, mohamed, ali, during, the, late, 1910s, and, 1920s, garvey, was, also, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, the, irish, independence, movement, to, which, he, was, sympathetic, he, saw, strong, parallels, between, the, subjugation, of, ireland, and, the, global, subjugation, of, black, people, and, identified, strongly, with, the, irish, independence, leader, amon, de, valera, in, 1922, he, sent, a, message, to, valera, stating, that, we, believe, ireland, should, be, free, even, as, africa, shall, be, free, for, the, negroes, of, the, world, keep, up, the, fight, for, a, free, ireland, for, garvey, ireland, s, sinn, f, in, and, the, irish, independence, movement, served, as, blueprints, for, his, own, black, nationalist, cause, in, july, 1919, he, stated, that, the, time, has, come, for, the, negro, race, to, offer, up, its, martyrs, upon, the, altar, of, liberty, even, as, the, irish, given, a, long, list, from, robert, emmet, to, roger, casement, he, also, expressed, admiration, for, the, indian, independence, movement, which, was, seeking, independence, from, british, rule, in, india, describing, mahatma, gandhi, as, one, of, the, noblest, characters, of, the, day, race, first, was, the, adage, which, was, widely, used, in, garveyism, in, garvey, s, view, no, race, in, the, world, is, so, just, as, to, give, others, for, the, asking, a, square, deal, in, things, economic, political, and, social, but, rather, each, racial, group, will, favor, its, own, interests, rejecting, the, melting, pot, notion, of, much, 20th, century, american, nationalism, he, was, hostile, to, the, efforts, of, the, progressive, movement, to, agitate, for, social, and, political, rights, for, african, americans, arguing, that, this, was, ineffective, and, that, laws, would, never, change, the, underlying, racial, prejudice, of, european, americans, he, argued, that, the, european, american, population, of, the, u, s, would, never, tolerate, the, social, integration, which, was, being, advocated, by, activists, like, du, bois, because, he, believed, that, campaigns, for, such, integration, would, lead, to, anti, black, riots, and, lynchings, he, openly, conceded, that, the, u, s, was, a, white, man, s, country, and, thus, he, did, not, think, that, african, americans, should, expect, equal, treatment, within, it, thus, he, opposed, attempts, to, socially, and, economically, integrate, the, different, races, which, lived, within, the, country, garveyism, promoted, the, view, that, whites, had, no, duty, to, help, blacks, achieve, racial, equality, maintaining, the, view, that, the, latter, needed, to, advance, themselves, on, their, own, initiative, he, advocated, racial, separatism, but, he, did, not, believe, in, black, supremacy, he, also, rallied, against, eurocentric, beauty, standards, among, blacks, seeing, them, as, impediments, to, black, self, respect, stop, making, noise, about, social, equality, giving, the, white, people, the, idea, that, we, are, hankering, after, their, company, and, get, down, to, business, and, build, up, a, strong, race, industrially, commercially, educationally, and, politically, everything, social, will, come, afterwards, marcus, garvey, 1921, in, the, u, s, ideas, about, the, need, for, black, racial, purity, became, central, to, garvey, s, thought, he, vehemently, denounced, miscegenation, believing, that, mixed, race, individuals, were, torn, by, dual, allegiances, and, they, would, often, ally, themselves, with, the, more, powerful, race, thus, they, would, become, traitors, to, the, race, garvey, argued, that, mixed, race, people, would, be, bred, out, of, existence, cronon, believed, that, garvey, exhibited, antipathy, and, distrust, of, anybody, but, the, darkest, skinned, negroes, the, hostility, towards, black, people, whose, african, blood, was, not, considered, pure, was, a, sentiment, which, garvey, shared, with, blyden, this, view, caused, great, friction, between, garvey, and, du, bois, with, the, former, accusing, du, bois, and, the, naacp, of, promoting, amalgamation, or, general, miscegenation, he, rallied, against, what, he, called, the, race, destroying, doctrine, of, those, african, americans, who, were, promulgating, racial, integration, in, the, u, s, instead, he, maintained, the, view, that, his, unia, stood, for, the, pride, and, purity, of, race, we, believe, that, the, white, race, should, uphold, its, racial, pride, and, perpetuate, itself, and, we, also, believe, that, the, black, race, should, do, likewise, we, believe, that, there, is, room, enough, in, the, world, for, the, various, race, groups, to, grow, and, develop, by, themselves, without, seeking, to, destroy, the, creator, s, plan, by, the, constant, introduction, of, mongrel, types, arguing, that, garvey, imitated, white, supremacist, ideas, at, random, the, scholar, john, l, graves, commented, that, racism, permeated, nearly, every, iota, of, his, ideology, with, garveyism, representing, a, gospel, of, hate, for, whites, garvey, s, belief, in, racial, separatism, his, advocacy, of, the, migration, of, african, americans, to, africa, and, his, opposition, to, miscegenation, endeared, him, to, the, kkk, which, supported, many, of, the, same, policies, garvey, was, willing, to, collaborate, with, the, kkk, in, order, to, achieve, his, aims, and, it, was, willing, to, work, with, him, because, his, approach, effectively, acknowledged, its, belief, that, the, u, s, should, only, be, a, country, for, white, people, and, campaigns, for, advanced, rights, for, african, americans, who, are, living, within, the, u, s, should, be, abandoned, garvey, called, for, collaboration, between, black, and, white, separatists, stating, that, they, shared, common, goals, the, purification, of, the, races, their, autonomous, separation, and, the, unbridled, freedom, of, self, development, and, self, expression, those, who, are, against, this, are, enemies, of, both, races, and, rebels, against, morality, nature, and, god, in, his, view, the, kkk, and, other, far, right, white, groups, were, better, friends, of, black, people, than, all, other, groups, of, hypocritical, whites, put, together, because, they, were, honest, about, their, desires, and, intentions, garvey, was, a, pan, africanist, and, an, african, nationalist, in, jamaica, he, and, his, supporters, were, heavily, influenced, by, the, pan, africanist, teachings, of, dr, love, and, alexander, bedward, in, the, wake, of, the, first, world, war, garvey, called, for, the, formation, of, a, united, africa, for, the, africans, of, the, world, the, unia, promoted, the, view, that, africa, was, the, natural, homeland, of, the, african, diaspora, while, he, was, imprisoned, he, penned, an, editorial, for, the, negro, world, titled, african, fundamentalism, in, which, he, called, for, the, founding, of, a, racial, empire, whose, only, natural, spiritual, and, political, aims, shall, be, god, and, africa, at, home, and, abroad, garvey, supported, the, back, to, africa, movement, which, had, been, influenced, by, edward, wilmot, blyden, who, migrated, to, liberia, in, 1850, however, garvey, did, not, believe, that, all, african, americans, should, migrate, to, africa, instead, he, believed, that, an, elite, group, namely, those, african, americans, who, were, of, the, purest, african, blood, should, do, so, the, rest, of, the, african, american, population, he, believed, should, remain, in, the, united, states, where, it, would, become, extinct, within, fifty, years, a, proponent, of, the, back, to, africa, movement, garvey, called, for, a, vanguard, of, educated, and, skilled, african, americans, to, travel, to, west, africa, a, journey, which, would, be, facilitated, by, his, black, star, line, garvey, stated, that, the, majority, of, us, may, remain, here, but, we, must, send, our, scientists, our, mechanics, and, our, artisans, and, let, them, build, railroads, let, them, build, the, great, educational, and, other, institutions, necessary, after, which, other, members, of, the, african, diaspora, could, join, them, he, was, aware, that, the, majority, of, african, americans, would, not, want, to, move, to, africa, until, it, had, the, more, modern, comforts, that, they, had, become, accustomed, to, in, the, u, s, through, the, unia, he, discussed, plans, for, a, migration, to, liberia, but, these, plans, came, to, nothing, and, his, hope, to, move, african, americans, to, west, africa, ultimately, failed, wheresoever, i, go, whether, it, is, england, france, or, germany, i, am, told, this, is, a, white, man, s, country, wheresoever, i, travel, throughout, the, united, states, of, america, i, am, made, to, understand, that, i, am, a, nigger, if, the, englishman, claims, england, as, his, native, habitat, and, the, frenchman, claims, france, the, time, has, come, for, 400, million, negroes, to, claim, africa, as, their, native, land, if, you, believe, that, the, negro, should, have, a, place, in, the, sun, if, you, believe, that, africa, should, be, one, vast, empire, controlled, by, the, negro, then, arise, garvey, august, 1920, in, the, 1920s, garvey, referred, to, his, desire, for, a, big, black, republic, in, africa, garvey, s, envisioned, africa, was, to, be, a, one, party, state, in, which, the, president, could, have, absolute, authority, to, appoint, all, of, his, lieutenants, from, cabinet, ministers, governors, of, states, and, territories, administrators, and, judges, to, minor, offices, according, to, the, scholar, of, african, american, studies, wilson, s, moses, the, future, african, state, which, garvey, envisioned, was, authoritarian, elitist, collectivist, racist, and, capitalistic, suggesting, that, it, would, have, resembled, the, later, haitian, government, of, fran, ois, duvalier, garvey, told, the, historian, j, a, rogers, that, he, and, his, followers, were, the, first, fascists, adding, that, mussolini, copied, fascism, from, me, but, the, negro, reactionaries, sabotaged, it, garvey, never, visited, africa, himself, and, he, did, not, speak, any, african, language, he, knew, very, little, about, the, continent, s, varied, customs, languages, religions, and, traditional, social, structures, and, his, critics, frequently, believed, that, his, views, of, the, continent, were, based, on, romanticism, and, ignorance, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, european, colonial, authorities, would, not, have, given, garvey, permission, to, visit, colonies, where, he, would, be, calling, for, decolonization, for, instance, the, jamaican, writer, and, poet, claude, mckay, noted, that, garvey, talks, of, africa, as, if, it, were, a, little, island, in, the, caribbean, sea, garvey, believed, in, negative, stereotypes, about, africa, which, portrayed, it, as, a, backward, continent, that, was, in, need, of, the, civilizing, influence, of, western, christian, states, among, his, stated, aims, he, wanted, to, assist, in, civilizing, the, backward, tribes, of, africa, and, he, also, wanted, to, promote, a, conscientious, christian, worship, among, them, his, belief, that, africans, would, ultimately, be, liberated, by, the, efforts, of, the, african, diaspora, which, was, living, outside, the, continent, has, been, considered, condescending, moses, stated, that, instead, of, being, based, on, respect, for, indigenous, african, cultures, garvey, s, views, of, an, ideal, united, africa, were, based, on, an, imperial, model, of, the, kind, which, was, promoted, by, western, powers, when, he, extolled, the, glories, of, africa, garvey, cited, the, ancient, egyptians, and, ethiopians, who, had, built, empires, and, monumental, architectural, structures, which, he, cited, as, evidence, of, civilization, rather, than, the, smaller, scale, societies, which, lived, on, other, parts, of, the, continent, in, doing, so, he, followed, the, lead, of, white, academics, of, that, era, who, were, similarly, ignorant, of, most, of, african, history, and, who, focused, nearly, exclusively, on, ancient, egypt, moses, thought, that, garvey, had, more, affinity, for, the, pomp, and, tinsel, of, european, imperialism, than, he, did, for, black, african, tribal, life, similarly, the, writer, richard, hart, noted, that, garvey, was, much, attracted, by, the, glamour, of, the, british, nobility, an, attraction, which, was, reflected, when, he, honored, prominent, supporters, by, giving, them, such, british, derived, titles, as, lords, ladies, and, knights, garvey, s, head, was, not, turned, however, by, the, scholarly, authority, of, harvard, university, professor, george, reisner, whose, opinion, garvey, challenged, on, the, pages, of, the, negro, world, we, must, prepare, now, by, organizing, ourselves, all, over, the, world, by, building, businesses, stores, and, factories, to, sustain, our, people, and, free, ourselves, marcus, garvey, garvey, believed, in, economic, independence, for, the, african, diaspora, and, through, the, unia, he, attempted, to, achieve, it, by, forming, ventures, like, the, black, star, line, and, the, negro, factories, corporation, in, garvey, s, opinion, without, commerce, and, industry, a, people, perish, economically, the, negro, is, perishing, because, he, has, no, economic, system, in, his, view, european, american, employers, would, always, favor, european, american, employees, so, to, gain, more, security, african, americans, needed, to, form, their, own, businesses, in, his, words, the, negro, must, become, independent, of, white, capital, and, white, employers, if, he, wants, salvation, he, believed, that, financial, independence, for, the, african, american, community, would, ensure, greater, protection, from, discrimination, and, provide, the, foundation, for, social, justice, economically, garvey, supported, capitalism, stating, that, capitalism, is, necessary, to, the, progress, of, the, world, and, those, who, unreasonably, and, wantonly, oppose, it, or, fight, against, it, are, enemies, of, human, advancement, in, the, u, s, garvey, promoted, a, capitalistic, ethos, for, the, economic, development, of, the, african, american, community, advocating, black, capitalism, his, emphasis, on, capitalist, ventures, meant, according, to, grant, that, garvey, was, making, a, straight, pitch, to, the, petit, bourgeois, capitalist, instinct, of, the, majority, of, black, folk, he, admired, booker, t, washington, s, economic, endeavours, but, criticized, his, focus, on, individualism, garvey, believed, that, african, american, interests, would, best, be, advanced, if, businesses, included, collective, decision, making, and, group, profit, sharing, his, advocacy, of, capitalistic, wealth, distribution, was, a, more, equitable, view, of, capitalism, than, the, view, of, capitalism, which, was, then, prevalent, in, the, u, s, he, believed, that, some, restrictions, should, be, imposed, on, individuals, and, businesses, in, order, to, prevent, them, from, acquiring, too, much, wealth, in, his, view, no, individual, should, be, allowed, to, control, more, than, one, million, dollars, and, no, company, should, be, allowed, to, control, more, than, five, million, dollars, while, he, was, living, in, harlem, he, envisioned, the, formation, of, a, global, network, of, black, people, who, would, trade, among, themselves, believing, that, his, black, star, line, would, contribute, to, the, achievement, of, this, aim, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, view, that, garvey, was, ever, sympathetic, to, socialism, while, he, was, living, in, the, u, s, he, strongly, opposed, attempts, to, recruit, african, americans, into, the, trade, union, movement, by, socialist, and, communist, groups, and, he, urged, african, americans, not, to, support, the, communist, party, this, led, to, heavy, scrutiny, from, communist, group, leaders, and, figureheads, such, as, grace, campbell, among, others, he, believed, that, the, communist, movement, did, not, serve, the, interests, of, african, americans, because, it, was, a, white, person, s, creation, he, stated, that, communism, was, a, dangerous, theory, of, economic, or, political, reformation, because, it, seeks, to, put, government, in, the, hands, of, an, ignorant, white, mass, who, have, not, been, able, to, destroy, their, natural, prejudices, towards, negroes, and, other, non, white, people, while, it, may, be, a, good, thing, for, them, it, will, be, a, bad, thing, for, the, negroes, who, will, fall, under, the, government, of, the, most, ignorant, prejudiced, class, of, the, white, race, in, response, the, communist, international, characterised, garveyism, as, a, reactionary, bourgeois, philosophy, whilst, our, god, has, no, color, yet, it, is, human, to, see, everything, through, one, s, own, spectacles, and, since, the, white, people, have, seen, their, god, through, white, spectacles, we, have, only, now, started, out, late, though, it, be, to, see, our, god, through, our, own, spectacles, garvey, on, viewing, god, as, black, 1923, grant, noted, that, garveyism, would, always, remain, a, secular, movement, with, a, strong, under, tow, of, religion, garvey, envisioned, a, form, of, christianity, which, would, specifically, be, designed, for, black, african, people, a, sort, of, black, religion, reflecting, his, own, view, of, religion, he, wanted, this, black, centric, christianity, to, be, as, close, to, catholicism, as, possible, even, so, he, attended, the, foundation, ceremony, of, the, african, orthodox, church, in, chicago, in, 1921, according, to, graves, this, church, preached, the, orthodox, christian, tradition, with, emphasis, on, racism, and, cronon, suggested, that, garvey, promoted, racist, ideas, about, religion, garvey, emphasised, the, idea, of, black, people, worshipping, a, god, who, was, also, depicted, as, black, in, his, words, if, the, white, man, has, the, idea, of, a, white, god, let, him, worship, his, god, as, he, desires, since, the, white, people, have, seen, their, god, through, white, spectacles, we, have, only, now, started, out, to, see, our, god, through, our, own, spectacles, we, shall, worship, him, through, the, spectacles, of, ethiopia, he, called, for, black, people, to, worship, images, of, jesus, of, nazareth, and, the, virgin, mary, that, depicted, these, figures, as, black, africans, in, doing, so, he, did, not, make, use, of, pre, existing, forms, of, black, dominated, religions, garvey, had, little, experience, with, them, because, he, had, attended, a, white, run, wesleyan, congregation, when, he, was, a, child, and, later, he, converted, to, catholicism, physically, garvey, was, short, and, stocky, he, suffered, from, asthma, and, was, prone, to, lung, infections, and, throughout, his, adult, life, he, was, affected, by, bouts, of, pneumonia, tony, martin, called, garvey, a, restless, young, man, while, grant, thought, that, garvey, had, a, na, ve, but, determined, personality, in, his, early, years, grant, noted, that, garvey, possessed, a, single, mindedness, of, purpose, that, left, no, room, for, the, kind, of, spectacular, failure, that, was, always, a, possibility, he, was, an, eloquent, orator, with, cronon, suggesting, that, his, peculiar, gift, of, oratory, stemmed, from, a, combination, of, bombast, and, stirring, heroics, grant, described, garvey, s, public, speeches, as, strange, and, eclectic, part, evangelical, partly, formal, king, s, english, and, part, lilting, caribbean, speechifying, garvey, enjoyed, arguing, with, people, and, he, wanted, to, be, seen, as, a, learned, man, he, read, widely, particularly, in, history, cronon, suggested, that, garvey, s, florid, style, of, writing, and, speaking, his, fondness, for, appearing, in, a, richly, colored, cap, and, gown, and, his, use, of, the, honorary, degree, initials, d, c, l, after, his, name, were, crude, attempts, to, compensate, for, his, lack, of, formal, academic, qualifications, grant, thought, that, garvey, was, an, extraordinary, salesman, who, d, developed, a, philosophy, where, punters, weren, t, just, buying, into, a, business, but, were, placing, a, down, payment, on, future, black, redemption, even, his, enemies, acknowledged, that, he, was, a, skilled, organiser, and, promoter, for, grant, garvey, was, a, man, of, grand, purposeful, gestures, he, thought, that, the, black, nationalist, leader, was, an, ascetic, who, had, conservative, tastes, garvey, was, a, teetotaller, who, believed, that, alcohol, consumption, was, morally, reprehensible, he, collected, antique, ceramics, and, enjoyed, going, around, antique, shops, and, flea, markets, and, searching, for, items, to, add, to, his, collection, he, placed, value, on, courtesy, and, respect, discouraging, his, supporters, from, being, loutish, garvey, enjoyed, dressing, up, in, military, costumes, and, he, also, adored, regal, pomp, and, ceremony, he, believed, that, pageantry, would, stir, the, black, masses, out, of, their, apathy, despite, the, accusations, of, buffoonery, which, were, made, by, members, of, the, african, american, intelligentsia, grant, noted, that, garvey, had, a, tendency, to, overstate, his, achievements, but, cronon, thought, that, garvey, tended, to, surround, himself, with, sycophants, rather, than, more, competent, advisors, in, 1947, the, jamaican, historian, j, a, rogers, included, garvey, in, his, book, the, world, s, great, men, of, colour, where, he, noted, that, had, ever, come, to, power, he, would, have, been, another, robespierre, resorting, to, violence, and, terror, to, enforce, his, ideas, garvey, was, a, catholic, in, 1919, he, married, amy, ashwood, in, a, catholic, ceremony, but, they, separated, after, three, months, the, new, york, court, did, not, grant, garvey, a, divorce, but, later, he, obtained, a, divorce, in, jackson, county, missouri, ashwood, contested, the, legitimacy, of, this, divorce, and, for, the, rest, of, her, life, she, claimed, that, she, was, garvey, s, legitimate, spouse, he, married, secondly, to, amy, jacques, garvey, and, they, had, two, sons, his, first, son, marcus, garvey, iii, 1930, 8, december, 2020, became, an, electrical, engineer, and, served, as, the, seventh, president, general, of, the, unia, acl, his, second, son, julius, garvey, born, 1933, became, a, cardiovascular, surgeon, garvey, has, invariably, been, described, as, the, black, moses, of, his, race, a, group, psychologist, and, an, idealist, planner, an, iconoclast, an, egotist, a, zealot, a, charlatan, and, a, buffoon, he, has, also, been, portrayed, as, flamboyant, dynamic, bombastic, defiant, ruthless, a, dreamer, and, a, fool, regardless, of, what, history, will, write, about, him, and, his, personal, shortcomings, notwithstanding, marcus, garvey, was, undoubtedly, the, peerless, champion, of, his, race, he, was, a, bulwark, for, the, world, wide, organization, of, people, of, african, descent, milfred, c, fierce, in, the, black, scholar, 1972, a, polarizing, figure, garvey, was, both, revered, and, reviled, grant, noted, that, views, on, him, largely, divided, between, two, camps, one, camp, portrayed, him, as, a, charlatan, and, the, other, camp, portrayed, him, as, a, saint, similarly, cronon, noted, that, garvey, was, varyingly, perceived, as, a, strident, demagogue, or, a, dedicated, prophet, a, martyred, visionary, or, a, fabulous, con, man, martin, noted, that, by, the, time, garvey, returned, to, jamaica, in, the, 1920s, he, was, just, about, the, best, known, black, man, in, the, whole, world, the, size, and, scope, of, the, unia, has, also, attracted, attention, mark, christian, described, garvey, as, the, leader, of, the, largest, black, mass, movement, in, modern, history, and, john, henrik, clarke, termed, it, the, first, black, mass, protest, crusade, in, the, history, of, the, united, states, garvey, s, ideas, influenced, many, black, people, who, never, became, paying, members, of, the, unia, with, graves, noting, that, more, than, anything, else, garvey, gave, negroes, self, assertion, and, self, reliance, in, jamaica, garvey, is, considered, a, national, hero, in, 1969, jamaica, s, government, posthumously, conferred, the, order, of, the, national, hero, upon, him, the, scholar, of, african, american, studies, molefi, kete, asante, included, garvey, on, his, 2002, list, of, 100, greatest, african, americans, and, in, 2008, the, american, writer, ta, nehisi, coates, described, garvey, as, the, patron, saint, of, the, black, nationalist, movement, grant, thought, that, garvey, along, with, du, bois, deserved, to, be, seen, as, the, father, of, pan, africanism, and, the, nigerian, historian, b, steiner, ifekwe, called, garvey, one, of, the, greatest, pan, african, leaders, of, the, time, garvey, has, received, praise, from, people, who, believe, that, he, was, a, race, patriot, and, many, african, americans, believe, that, he, encouraged, black, people, to, develop, a, sense, of, self, respect, and, pride, while, he, was, living, in, the, u, s, garvey, was, frequently, referred, to, sometimes, sarcastically, as, the, negro, moses, implying, that, like, the, eponymous, old, testament, figure, he, would, lead, his, people, out, of, the, oppressive, situation, which, they, were, living, in, in, 1955, cronon, stated, that, while, garvey, achieved, little, in, the, way, of, permanent, improvement, for, black, people, he, awakened, fires, of, negro, nationalism, that, have, yet, to, be, extinguished, in, cronon, s, view, garvey, was, important, because, he, gave, african, descended, peoples, a, new, feeling, of, collective, pride, and, a, sense, of, individual, worth, hart, believed, that, garvey, s, importance, lay, in, the, fact, that, he, stirred, millions, of, people, who, were, otherwise, apathetic, into, action, in, this, way, hart, believed, that, garvey, had, helped, lay, the, groundwork, for, the, u, s, civil, rights, movement, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, even, though, that, movement, s, call, for, racial, integration, and, equality, within, the, u, s, ran, contrary, to, garvey, s, belief, in, racial, separation, and, his, advocacy, of, migration, to, africa, garvey, chiefly, attracted, attention, because, he, put, into, powerful, ringing, phrases, the, secret, thoughts, of, the, negro, world, he, told, his, listeners, what, they, wanted, to, hear, that, a, black, skin, was, not, a, badge, of, shame, but, rather, a, glorious, symbol, of, national, greatness, he, promised, a, negro, nation, in, the, african, homeland, that, would, be, the, marvel, of, the, modern, world, he, pointed, to, negro, triumphs, in, the, past, and, described, in, glowing, syllables, the, glories, of, the, future, when, garvey, spoke, of, the, greatness, of, the, race, negroes, everywhere, could, forget, for, a, moment, the, shame, of, discrimination, and, the, horrors, of, lynching, edmund, david, cronon, one, of, garvey, s, biographers, 1955, kwame, nkrumah, the, first, president, of, ghana, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, of, all, the, works, of, literature, which, he, had, studied, the, book, that, inspired, him, more, than, any, other, book, was, the, philosophy, and, opinions, of, marcus, garvey, or, africa, for, the, africans, nkrumah, went, on, to, name, ghana, s, national, shipping, line, the, black, star, line, and, there, is, a, black, star, square, in, accra, and, the, ghanaian, flag, also, contains, a, black, star, ghana, s, national, football, team, is, also, nicknamed, the, black, stars, while, he, was, living, in, the, u, s, garvey, faced, strong, opposition, from, many, prominent, figures, in, the, african, american, community, as, well, as, from, leading, progressive, and, left, wing, organisations, he, was, also, unpopular, within, elite, sections, of, the, african, american, community, in, part, perhaps, out, of, envy, of, his, successes, in, attracting, the, support, of, the, black, masses, and, in, part, out, of, concern, that, he, was, leading, their, community, astray, critics, regarded, him, as, an, idealist, and, he, was, sometimes, regarded, as, an, egotist, a, zealot, a, charlatan, and, a, buffoon, garvey, obtained, a, reputation, for, failing, to, pay, his, debts, and, his, detractors, accused, him, of, dishonesty, critics, like, du, bois, often, mocked, garvey, for, his, outfits, and, the, grandiose, titles, which, he, gave, to, himself, in, their, view, he, was, embarrassingly, pretentious, according, to, grant, many, members, of, the, established, african, american, middle, class, were, perplexed, and, embarrassed, by, garvey, who, thought, that, the, african, american, working, class, should, turn, to, their, leadership, rather, than, his, concerns, were, also, raised, about, his, violent, language, because, the, people, who, raised, them, believed, that, it, was, inciting, many, garveyites, to, carry, out, violent, acts, against, garvey, s, critics, during, his, lifetime, some, african, americans, wondered, if, he, really, understood, the, racial, issues, which, were, present, in, u, s, society, because, he, was, a, foreigner, and, later, african, american, leaders, frequently, held, the, view, that, garvey, had, failed, to, adequately, address, anti, black, racism, in, his, thought, grant, noted, that, in, the, years, after, garvey, s, death, his, life, was, primarily, presented, by, his, political, opponents, writing, for, the, black, scholar, in, 1972, the, scholar, of, african, american, studies, wilson, s, moses, expressed, concern, about, the, uncritical, adulation, of, garvey, within, african, american, political, circles, in, moses, opinion, this, adulation, led, to, red, baiting, and, divisive, rhetoric, about, being, blacker, than, thou, moses, argued, that, it, was, wrong, for, people, to, regard, garvey, as, a, man, of, the, people, because, he, had, a, petty, bourgeoise, background, and, as, a, result, he, had, enjoyed, cultural, economic, and, educational, advantages, which, few, of, his, black, contemporaries, had, enjoyed, in, the, late, 1920s, garvey, had, some, ties, to, the, french, black, movement, especially, the, group, of, the, comit, de, d, fense, de, la, race, noire, and, the, editor, of, its, journal, maurice, satineau, as, the, group, was, somewhat, divided, between, a, larger, group, of, colonial, reformists, and, a, smaller, group, of, representants, of, the, n, gritude, there, was, strong, concern, by, moderate, members, about, garvey, as, they, were, afraid, of, his, radical, nationalist, approach, resulting, in, a, cut, of, the, ties, in, the, colony, of, jamaica, garvey, was, largely, forgotten, in, the, years, after, his, death, but, interest, in, him, was, revived, by, the, rastafari, religious, movement, jacques, wrote, a, book, about, her, late, husband, garvey, and, garveyism, and, after, finding, that, no, publishers, were, interested, in, it, she, self, published, the, volume, in, 1963, in, 1962, when, jamaica, became, independent, the, government, hailed, garvey, as, a, hero, in, 1969, he, was, posthumously, conferred, with, the, order, of, the, national, hero, by, the, jamaican, government, in, 1975, the, reggae, artist, burning, spear, released, the, album, marcus, garvey, interest, in, garvey, s, ideas, would, also, be, revived, in, the, 1960s, through, the, growth, of, independent, states, across, africa, and, the, emergence, of, the, black, power, movement, in, the, united, states, mark, christian, suggested, that, garveyism, gave, an, important, psychological, boost, to, african, leaders, campaigning, for, independence, from, european, colonial, rule, while, claudius, fergus, proposed, that, it, played, an, important, role, in, encouraging, africans, to, see, the, african, diaspora, as, an, integral, constituent, of, their, own, political, destiny, in, his, autobiography, kwame, nkrumah, the, prominent, pan, africanist, activist, who, became, ghana, s, first,
