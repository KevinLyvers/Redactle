hesiod, h, i, s, i, d, hee, see, d, or, h, s, i, d, heh, see, d, greek, h, s, odos, was, an, ancient, greek, poet, generally, thought, to, have, been, active, between, 750, and, 650, bc, around, the, same, time, as, homer, several, of, hesiod, s, works, have, survived, in, their, entirety, among, these, are, theogony, which, tells, the, origins, of, the, gods, their, lineages, and, the, events, that, led, to, zeus, s, rise, to, power, and, works, and, days, a, poem, that, describes, the, five, ages, of, man, offers, advice, and, wisdom, and, includes, myths, such, as, pandora, s, box, hesiod, is, generally, regarded, by, western, authors, as, the, first, written, poet, in, the, western, tradition, to, regard, himself, as, an, individual, persona, with, an, active, role, to, play, in, his, subject, ancient, authors, credited, hesiod, and, homer, with, establishing, greek, religious, customs, modern, scholars, refer, to, him, as, a, major, source, on, greek, mythology, farming, techniques, early, economic, thought, archaic, greek, astronomy, cosmology, and, ancient, time, keeping, the, dating, of, hesiod, s, life, is, a, contested, issue, in, scholarly, circles, see, dating, below, epic, narrative, allowed, poets, such, as, homer, no, opportunity, for, personal, revelations, however, hesiod, s, extant, work, comprises, several, didactic, poems, in, which, he, went, out, of, his, way, to, let, his, audience, in, on, a, few, details, of, his, life, there, are, three, explicit, references, in, works, and, days, as, well, as, some, passages, in, his, theogony, that, support, inferences, made, by, scholars, the, former, poem, says, that, his, father, came, from, cyme, in, aeolis, on, the, coast, of, asia, minor, a, little, south, of, the, island, of, lesbos, and, crossed, the, sea, to, settle, at, a, hamlet, near, thespiae, in, boeotia, named, ascra, a, cursed, place, cruel, in, winter, hard, in, summer, never, pleasant, works, 640, hesiod, s, patrimony, property, inherited, from, one, s, father, or, male, ancestor, in, ascra, a, small, piece, of, ground, at, the, foot, of, mount, helicon, occasioned, lawsuits, with, his, brother, perses, who, at, first, seems, to, have, cheated, him, of, his, rightful, share, thanks, to, corrupt, authorities, or, kings, but, later, became, impoverished, and, ended, up, scrounging, from, the, thrifty, poet, works, 35, 396, unlike, his, father, hesiod, was, averse, to, sea, travel, but, he, once, crossed, the, narrow, strait, between, the, greek, mainland, and, euboea, to, participate, in, funeral, celebrations, for, one, athamas, of, chalcis, and, there, won, a, tripod, in, a, singing, competition, he, also, describes, meeting, the, muses, on, mount, helicon, where, he, had, been, pasturing, sheep, when, the, goddesses, presented, him, with, a, laurel, staff, a, symbol, of, poetic, authority, theogony, 22, 35, fanciful, though, the, story, might, seem, the, account, has, led, ancient, and, modern, scholars, to, infer, that, he, was, not, a, professionally, trained, rhapsode, or, he, would, have, been, presented, with, a, lyre, instead, some, scholars, have, seen, perses, as, a, literary, creation, a, foil, for, the, moralizing, that, hesiod, develops, in, works, and, days, but, there, are, also, arguments, against, that, theory, for, example, it, is, quite, common, for, works, of, moral, instruction, to, have, an, imaginative, setting, as, a, means, of, getting, the, audience, s, attention, but, it, could, be, difficult, to, see, how, hesiod, could, have, traveled, around, the, countryside, entertaining, people, with, a, narrative, about, himself, if, the, account, was, known, to, be, fictitious, gregory, nagy, on, the, other, hand, sees, both, p, rs, s, the, destroyer, from, p, rth, and, h, s, odos, he, who, emits, the, voice, from, h, mi, and, aud, as, fictitious, names, for, poetical, personae, it, might, seem, unusual, that, hesiod, s, father, migrated, from, asia, minor, westwards, to, mainland, greece, the, opposite, direction, to, most, colonial, movements, at, the, time, and, hesiod, himself, gives, no, explanation, for, it, however, around, 750, bc, or, a, little, later, there, was, a, migration, of, seagoing, merchants, from, his, original, home, in, cyme, in, asia, minor, to, cumae, in, campania, a, colony, they, shared, with, the, euboeans, and, possibly, his, move, west, had, something, to, do, with, that, since, euboea, is, not, far, from, boeotia, where, he, eventually, established, himself, and, his, family, the, family, association, with, aeolian, cyme, might, explain, his, familiarity, with, eastern, myths, evident, in, his, poems, though, the, greek, world, might, have, already, developed, its, own, versions, of, them, in, spite, of, hesiod, s, complaints, about, poverty, life, on, his, father, s, farm, could, not, have, been, too, uncomfortable, if, works, and, days, is, anything, to, judge, by, since, he, describes, the, routines, of, prosperous, yeomanry, rather, than, peasants, his, farmer, employs, a, friend, works, and, days, 370, as, well, as, servants, 502, 573, 597, 608, 766, an, energetic, and, responsible, ploughman, of, mature, years, 469, ff, a, slave, boy, to, cover, the, seed, 441, 6, a, female, servant, to, keep, house, 405, 602, and, working, teams, of, oxen, and, mules, 405, 607f, one, modern, scholar, surmises, that, hesiod, may, have, learned, about, world, geography, especially, the, catalogue, of, rivers, in, theogony, 337, 45, listening, to, his, father, s, accounts, of, his, own, sea, voyages, as, a, merchant, the, father, probably, spoke, in, the, aeolian, dialect, of, cyme, but, hesiod, probably, grew, up, speaking, the, local, boeotian, belonging, to, the, same, dialect, group, however, whilst, his, poetry, features, some, aeolisms, there, are, no, words, that, are, certainly, boeotian, his, basic, language, was, the, main, literary, dialect, of, the, time, homer, s, ionian, it, is, probable, that, hesiod, wrote, his, poems, down, or, dictated, them, rather, than, passing, them, on, orally, as, rhapsodes, did, otherwise, the, pronounced, personality, that, now, emerges, from, the, poems, would, surely, have, been, diluted, through, oral, transmission, from, one, rhapsode, to, another, pausanias, asserted, that, boeotians, showed, him, an, old, tablet, made, of, lead, on, which, the, works, were, engraved, if, he, did, write, or, dictate, it, was, perhaps, as, an, aid, to, memory, or, because, he, lacked, confidence, in, his, ability, to, produce, poems, extempore, as, trained, rhapsodes, could, do, it, certainly, was, not, in, a, quest, for, immortal, fame, since, poets, in, his, era, had, probably, no, such, notions, for, themselves, however, some, scholars, suspect, the, presence, of, large, scale, changes, in, the, text, and, attribute, it, to, oral, transmission, possibly, he, composed, his, verses, during, idle, times, on, the, farm, in, the, spring, before, the, may, harvest, or, the, dead, of, winter, the, personality, behind, the, poems, is, unsuited, to, the, kind, of, aristocratic, withdrawal, typical, of, a, rhapsode, but, is, instead, argumentative, suspicious, ironically, humorous, frugal, fond, of, proverbs, wary, of, women, he, was, in, fact, a, misogynist, of, the, same, calibre, as, the, later, poet, semonides, he, resembles, solon, in, his, preoccupation, with, issues, of, good, versus, evil, and, how, a, just, and, all, powerful, god, can, allow, the, unjust, to, flourish, in, this, life, he, recalls, aristophanes, in, his, rejection, of, the, idealised, hero, of, epic, literature, in, favour, of, an, idealized, view, of, the, farmer, yet, the, fact, that, he, could, eulogize, kings, in, theogony, 80, ff, 430, 434, and, denounce, them, as, corrupt, in, works, and, days, suggests, that, he, could, resemble, whichever, audience, he, composed, for, various, legends, accumulated, about, hesiod, and, they, are, recorded, in, several, sources, two, different, yet, early, traditions, record, the, site, of, hesiod, s, grave, one, as, early, as, thucydides, reported, in, plutarch, the, suda, and, john, tzetzes, states, that, the, delphic, oracle, warned, hesiod, that, he, would, die, in, nemea, and, so, he, fled, to, locris, where, he, was, killed, at, the, local, temple, to, nemean, zeus, and, buried, there, this, tradition, follows, a, familiar, ironic, convention, the, oracle, predicts, accurately, after, all, the, other, tradition, first, mentioned, in, an, epigram, by, chersias, of, orchomenus, written, in, the, 7th, century, bc, within, a, century, or, so, of, hesiod, s, death, claims, that, hesiod, lies, buried, at, orchomenus, a, town, in, boeotia, according, to, aristotle, s, constitution, of, orchomenus, when, the, thespians, ravaged, ascra, the, villagers, sought, refuge, at, orchomenus, where, following, the, advice, of, an, oracle, they, collected, the, ashes, of, hesiod, and, set, them, in, a, place, of, honour, in, their, agora, next, to, the, tomb, of, minyas, their, eponymous, founder, eventually, they, came, to, regard, hesiod, too, as, their, hearth, founder, oikist, s, later, writers, attempted, to, harmonize, these, two, accounts, yet, another, account, taken, from, classical, sources, cited, by, author, charles, abraham, elton, in, his, remains, of, hesiod, the, ascr, an, including, the, shield, of, hercules, by, hesiod, depicts, hesiod, as, being, falsely, accused, of, rape, by, a, girl, s, brothers, and, murdered, in, reprisal, despite, his, advanced, age, while, the, true, culprit, his, milesian, fellow, traveler, managed, to, escape, greeks, in, the, late, 5th, and, early, 4th, centuries, bc, considered, their, oldest, poets, to, be, orpheus, musaeus, hesiod, and, homer, in, that, order, thereafter, greek, writers, began, to, consider, homer, earlier, than, hesiod, devotees, of, orpheus, and, musaeus, were, probably, responsible, for, precedence, being, given, to, their, two, cult, heroes, and, maybe, the, homeridae, were, responsible, in, later, antiquity, for, promoting, homer, at, hesiod, s, expense, the, first, known, writers, to, locate, homer, earlier, than, hesiod, were, xenophanes, and, heraclides, ponticus, though, aristarchus, of, samothrace, was, the, first, actually, to, argue, the, case, ephorus, made, homer, a, younger, cousin, of, hesiod, the, 5th, century, bc, historian, herodotus, histories, ii, 53, evidently, considered, them, near, contemporaries, and, the, 4th, century, bc, sophist, alcidamas, in, his, work, mouseion, even, brought, them, together, for, an, imagined, poetic, g, n, which, survives, today, as, the, contest, of, homer, and, hesiod, most, scholars, today, agree, with, homer, s, priority, but, there, are, good, arguments, on, either, side, hesiod, certainly, predates, the, lyric, and, elegiac, poets, whose, work, has, come, down, to, the, modern, era, imitations, of, his, work, have, been, observed, in, alcaeus, epimenides, mimnermus, semonides, tyrtaeus, and, archilochus, from, which, it, has, been, inferred, that, the, latest, possible, date, for, him, is, about, 650, bc, an, upper, limit, of, 750, bc, is, indicated, by, a, number, of, considerations, such, as, the, probability, that, his, work, was, written, down, the, fact, that, he, mentions, a, sanctuary, at, delphi, that, was, of, little, national, significance, before, c, 750, bc, theogony, 499, and, he, lists, rivers, that, flow, into, the, euxine, a, region, explored, and, developed, by, greek, colonists, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, bc, theogony, 337, 45, hesiod, mentions, a, poetry, contest, at, chalcis, in, euboea, where, the, sons, of, one, amphidamas, awarded, him, a, tripod, works, and, days, 654, 662, plutarch, identified, this, amphidamas, with, the, hero, of, the, lelantine, war, between, chalcis, and, eretria, and, he, concluded, that, the, passage, must, be, an, interpolation, into, hesiod, s, original, work, assuming, that, the, lelantine, war, was, too, late, for, hesiod, modern, scholars, have, accepted, his, identification, of, amphidamas, but, disagreed, with, his, conclusion, the, date, of, the, war, is, not, known, precisely, but, estimates, placing, it, around, 730, 705, bc, fit, the, estimated, chronology, for, hesiod, in, that, case, the, tripod, that, hesiod, won, might, have, been, awarded, for, his, rendition, of, theogony, a, poem, that, seems, to, presuppose, the, kind, of, aristocratic, audience, he, would, have, met, at, chalcis, three, works, have, survived, which, were, attributed, to, hesiod, by, ancient, commentators, works, and, days, theogony, and, shield, of, heracles, only, fragments, exist, of, other, works, attributed, to, him, the, surviving, works, and, fragments, were, all, written, in, the, conventional, metre, and, language, of, epic, however, the, shield, of, heracles, is, now, known, to, be, spurious, and, probably, was, written, in, the, sixth, century, bc, many, ancient, critics, also, rejected, theogony, e, g, pausanias, 9, 31, 3, even, though, hesiod, mentions, himself, by, name, in, that, poem, theogony, and, works, and, days, might, be, very, different, in, subject, matter, but, they, share, a, distinctive, language, metre, and, prosody, that, subtly, distinguish, them, from, homer, s, work, and, from, the, shield, of, heracles, see, hesiod, s, greek, below, moreover, they, both, refer, to, the, same, version, of, the, prometheus, myth, yet, even, these, authentic, poems, may, include, interpolations, for, example, the, first, ten, verses, of, the, works, and, days, may, have, been, borrowed, from, an, orphic, hymn, to, zeus, they, were, recognised, as, not, the, work, of, hesiod, by, critics, as, ancient, as, pausanias, some, scholars, have, detected, a, proto, historical, perspective, in, hesiod, a, view, rejected, by, paul, cartledge, for, example, on, the, grounds, that, hesiod, advocates, a, not, forgetting, without, any, attempt, at, verification, hesiod, has, also, been, considered, the, father, of, gnomic, verse, he, had, a, passion, for, systematizing, and, explaining, things, ancient, greek, poetry, in, general, had, strong, philosophical, tendencies, and, hesiod, like, homer, demonstrates, a, deep, interest, in, a, wide, range, of, philosophical, issues, from, the, nature, of, divine, justice, to, the, beginnings, of, human, society, aristotle, metaphysics, 983b, 987a, believed, that, the, question, of, first, causes, may, even, have, started, with, hesiod, theogony, 116, 53, and, homer, iliad, 14, 201, 246, he, viewed, the, world, from, outside, the, charmed, circle, of, aristocratic, rulers, protesting, against, their, injustices, in, a, tone, of, voice, that, has, been, described, as, having, a, grumpy, quality, redeemed, by, a, gaunt, dignity, but, as, stated, in, the, biography, section, he, could, also, change, to, suit, the, audience, this, ambivalence, appears, to, underlie, his, presentation, of, human, history, in, works, and, days, where, he, depicts, a, golden, period, when, life, was, easy, and, good, followed, by, a, steady, decline, in, behaviour, and, happiness, through, the, silver, bronze, and, iron, ages, except, that, he, inserts, a, heroic, age, between, the, last, two, representing, its, warlike, men, as, better, than, their, bronze, predecessors, he, seems, in, this, case, to, be, catering, to, two, different, world, views, one, epic, and, aristocratic, the, other, unsympathetic, to, the, heroic, traditions, of, the, aristocracy, the, theogony, is, commonly, considered, hesiod, s, earliest, work, despite, the, different, subject, matter, between, this, poem, and, the, works, and, days, most, scholars, with, some, notable, exceptions, believe, that, the, two, works, were, written, by, the, same, man, as, m, l, west, writes, both, bear, the, marks, of, a, distinct, personality, a, surly, conservative, countryman, given, to, reflection, no, lover, of, women, or, life, who, felt, the, gods, presence, heavy, about, him, an, example, hateful, strife, bore, painful, toil, neglect, starvation, and, tearful, pain, battles, combats, the, theogony, concerns, the, origins, of, the, world, cosmogony, and, of, the, gods, theogony, beginning, with, chaos, gaia, tartarus, and, eros, and, shows, a, special, interest, in, genealogy, embedded, in, greek, myth, there, remain, fragments, of, quite, variant, tales, hinting, at, the, rich, variety, of, myth, that, once, existed, city, by, city, but, hesiod, s, retelling, of, the, old, stories, became, according, to, herodotus, the, accepted, version, that, linked, all, hellenes, it, s, the, earliest, known, source, for, the, myths, of, pandora, prometheus, and, the, golden, age, the, creation, myth, in, hesiod, has, long, been, held, to, have, eastern, influences, such, as, the, hittite, song, of, kumarbi, and, the, babylonian, enuma, elis, this, cultural, crossover, may, have, occurred, in, the, eighth, and, ninth, century, greek, trading, colonies, such, as, al, mina, in, north, syria, for, more, discussion, read, robin, lane, fox, s, travelling, heroes, and, peter, walcot, s, hesiod, and, the, near, east, works, and, days, is, a, poem, of, over, 800, lines, which, revolves, around, two, general, truths, labour, is, the, universal, lot, of, man, but, he, who, is, willing, to, work, will, get, by, scholars, have, interpreted, this, work, against, a, background, of, agrarian, crisis, in, mainland, greece, which, inspired, a, wave, of, documented, colonisations, in, search, of, new, land, works, and, days, may, have, been, influenced, by, an, established, tradition, of, didactic, poetry, based, on, sumerian, hebrew, babylonian, and, egyptian, wisdom, literature, this, work, lays, out, the, five, ages, of, man, as, well, as, containing, advice, and, wisdom, prescribing, a, life, of, honest, labour, and, attacking, idleness, and, unjust, judges, like, those, who, decided, in, favour, of, perses, as, well, as, the, practice, of, usury, it, describes, immortals, who, roam, the, earth, watching, over, justice, and, injustice, the, poem, regards, labor, as, the, source, of, all, good, in, that, both, gods, and, men, hate, the, idle, who, resemble, drones, in, a, hive, in, the, horror, of, the, triumph, of, violence, over, hard, work, and, honor, verses, describing, the, golden, age, present, the, social, character, and, practice, of, nonviolent, diet, through, agriculture, and, fruit, culture, as, a, higher, path, of, living, sufficiently, in, addition, to, the, theogony, and, works, and, days, numerous, other, poems, were, ascribed, to, hesiod, during, antiquity, modern, scholarship, has, doubted, their, authenticity, and, these, works, are, generally, referred, to, as, forming, part, of, the, hesiodic, corpus, whether, or, not, their, authorship, is, accepted, the, situation, is, summed, up, in, this, formulation, by, glenn, most, hesiod, is, the, name, of, a, person, hesiodic, is, a, designation, for, a, kind, of, poetry, including, but, not, limited, to, the, poems, of, which, the, authorship, may, reasonably, be, assigned, to, hesiod, himself, of, these, works, forming, the, extended, hesiodic, corpus, only, the, shield, of, heracles, aspis, h, rakleous, is, transmitted, intact, via, a, medieval, manuscript, tradition, classical, authors, also, attributed, to, hesiod, a, lengthy, genealogical, poem, known, as, catalogue, of, women, or, ehoiai, because, sections, began, with, the, greek, words, hoi, or, like, the, one, who, it, was, a, mythological, catalogue, of, the, mortal, women, who, had, mated, with, gods, and, of, the, offspring, and, descendants, of, these, unions, several, additional, hexameter, poems, were, ascribed, to, hesiod, in, addition, to, these, works, the, suda, lists, an, otherwise, unknown, dirge, for, batrachus, beloved, portrait, of, hesiod, from, augusta, treverorum, trier, from, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, mosaic, is, signed, in, its, central, field, by, the, maker, monnus, fecit, monnus, made, this, the, figure, is, identified, by, name, esio, dvs, hesiod, it, is, the, only, known, authenticated, portrait, of, hesiod, the, roman, bronze, bust, the, so, called, pseudo, seneca, of, the, late, first, century, bc, found, at, herculaneum, is, now, thought, not, to, be, of, seneca, the, younger, it, has, been, identified, by, gisela, richter, as, an, imagined, portrait, of, hesiod, in, fact, it, has, been, recognized, since, 1813, that, the, bust, was, not, of, seneca, when, an, inscribed, herma, portrait, of, seneca, with, quite, different, features, was, discovered, most, scholars, now, follow, richter, s, identification, hesiod, employed, the, conventional, dialect, of, epic, verse, which, was, ionian, comparisons, with, homer, a, native, ionian, can, be, unflattering, hesiod, s, handling, of, the, dactylic, hexameter, was, not, as, masterful, or, fluent, as, homer, s, and, one, modern, scholar, refers, to, his, hobnailed, hexameters, his, use, of, language, and, meter, in, works, and, days, and, theogony, distinguishes, him, also, from, the, author, of, the, shield, of, heracles, all, three, poets, for, example, employed, digamma, inconsistently, sometimes, allowing, it, to, affect, syllable, length, and, meter, sometimes, not, the, ratio, of, observance, neglect, of, digamma, varies, between, them, the, extent, of, variation, depends, on, how, the, evidence, is, collected, and, interpreted, but, there, is, a, clear, trend, revealed, for, example, in, the, following, set, of, statistics, hesiod, does, not, observe, digamma, as, often, as, the, others, do, that, result, is, a, bit, counter, intuitive, since, digamma, was, still, a, feature, of, the, boeotian, dialect, that, hesiod, probably, spoke, whereas, it, had, already, vanished, from, the, ionic, vernacular, of, homer, this, anomaly, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, hesiod, made, a, conscious, effort, to, compose, like, an, ionian, epic, poet, at, a, time, when, digamma, was, not, heard, in, ionian, speech, while, homer, tried, to, compose, like, an, older, generation, of, ionian, bards, when, it, was, heard, in, ionian, speech, there, is, also, a, significant, difference, in, the, results, for, theogony, and, works, and, days, but, that, is, merely, due, to, the, fact, that, the, former, includes, a, catalog, of, divinities, and, therefore, it, makes, frequent, use, of, the, definite, article, associated, with, digamma, o, though, typical, of, epic, his, vocabulary, features, some, significant, differences, from, homer, s, one, scholar, has, counted, 278, un, homeric, words, in, works, and, days, 151, in, theogony, and, 95, in, shield, of, heracles, the, disproportionate, number, of, un, homeric, words, in, w, d, is, due, to, its, un, homeric, subject, matter, hesiod, s, vocabulary, also, includes, quite, a, lot, of, formulaic, phrases, that, are, not, found, in, homer, which, indicates, that, he, may, have, been, writing, within, a, different, tradition
