s, geography, and, ethnic, customs, and, it, included, the, first, western, record, of, porcelain, gunpowder, paper, money, and, some, asian, plants, and, exotic, animals, his, narrative, inspired,

the, catalan, atlas, and, the, fra, mauro, map, marco, polo, was, born, around, 1254, in, venice, but, the, exact, date, and, place, of, birth, are, archivally, unknown, the, travels, of, marco, polo, contains, some, basic, information, concerning, marco, polo, s, venetian, family, and, his, birth, in, venice, the, book, states, that, marco, s, father, the, travelling, merchant, niccol, polo, returned, to, visit, his, family, in, his, hometown, of, venice, around, 1269, and, there, found, out, that, his, wife, whom, he, had, left, pregnant, had, died, and, left, a, 15, year, old, son, named, marco, in, contrast, to, the, general, consensus, there, are, theories, suggesting, that, marco, polo, s, birthplace, was, the, island, of, kor, ula, or, constantinople, but, such, hypotheses, failed, to, gain, acceptance, among, most, scholars, and, have, been, countered, by, other, studies, there, has, also, been, dispute, as, to, whether, the, polo, family, is, of, venetian, origin, because, their, exact, origin, is, also, unknown, there, existed, at, least, two, families, of, the, same, surname, in, venice, one, in, the, san, geremia, district, and, another, in, the, san, giovanni, grisostomo, where, was, marco, s, family, house, he, is, mentioned, in, 1323, as, marco, paulo, de, confinio, sancti, iohannis, grisostomi, and, their, members, and, coat, of, arms, are, often, mistaken, in, the, sources, some, venetian, sources, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, considered, that, the, family, polo, was, of, dalmatian, origin, placido, zurla, in, the, early, 19th, century, noted, that, in, the, historical, sources, there, is, a, lack, of, any, specific, mention, related, to, polo, s, family, while, niccol, tommaseo, in, the, mid, 19th, century, considered, dalmatian, origin, of, the, family, some, scholars, such, as, alvise, zorzi, argue, venetian, origin, and, that, it, can, be, traced, up, to, the, 10th, century, according, to, another, disputed, theory, their, origin, and, polo, s, birthplace, was, on, the, island, of, kor, ula, which, is, influenced, by, ramusio, s, account, about, polo, s, capture, during, the, battle, of, curzola, 1298, according, to, some, sources, in, 1168, his, great, uncle, marco, polo, the, elder, borrowed, money, and, commanded, a, ship, in, constantinople, and, his, grandfather, andrea, polo, of, the, parish, of, san, felice, had, three, sons, maffeo, yet, another, marco, and, the, traveller, s, father, niccol, this, genealogy, and, information, also, probably, confusing, separate, polo, families, created, by, giovanni, battista, ramusio, in, navigationi, et, viaggi, 1559, is, not, universally, accepted, as, there, is, no, additional, evidence, to, support, it, the, date, of, birth, of, polo, s, father, niccol, and, the, name, of, polo, s, mother, are, unknown, he, was, nicknamed, milione, during, his, lifetime, which, in, italian, literally, means, million, the, italian, title, of, his, book, was, il, libro, di, marco, polo, detto, il, milione, which, means, the, book, of, marco, polo, nicknamed, milione, according, to, the, 15th, century, humanist, giovanni, battista, ramusio, his, fellow, citizens, awarded, him, this, nickname, when, he, came, back, to, venice, because, he, kept, on, saying, that, kublai, khan, s, wealth, was, counted, in, millions, more, precisely, he, was, nicknamed, messer, marco, milioni, mr, marco, millions, however, since, also, his, father, niccol, was, nicknamed, milione, 19th, century, philologist, luigi, foscolo, benedetto, was, persuaded, that, milione, was, a, shortened, version, of, emilione, and, that, this, nickname, was, used, to, distinguish, niccol, s, and, marco, s, branch, from, other, polo, families, his, father, niccol, polo, a, merchant, traded, with, the, near, east, becoming, wealthy, and, achieving, great, prestige, niccol, and, his, brother, maffeo, set, off, on, a, trading, voyage, before, marco, s, birth, in, 1260, niccol, and,

the, travels, of, marco, polo, they, passed, through, much, of, asia, and, met, with, kublai, khan, a, mongol, ruler, and, founder, of, the, yuan, dynasty, almost, nothing, is, known, about, the, childhood, of, marco, polo, until, he, was, fifteen, years, old, except, that, he, probably, spent, part, of, his, childhood, in, venice, meanwhile, marco, polo, s, mother, died, and, an, aunt, and,

documented, in, his, book, they, sailed, to, acre, and, later, rode, on, their, camels, to, the, persian, port, hormuz, during, the, first, stages, of, the, journey, they, stayed, for, a, few, months, in, acre, and, were, able, to, speak, with, archdeacon, tedaldo, visconti, of, piacenza, the, polo, family, on, that, occasion, had, expressed, their, regret, at, the, long, lack, of, a, pope, because, on, their, previous, trip, to, china, they, had, received, a, letter, from, kublai, khan, to, the, pope, and, had, thus, had, to, leave, for, china, disappointed, during, the, trip, however, they, received, news, that, after, 33, months, of, vacation, finally, the, conclave, had, elected, the, new, pope, and, that, he, was, exactly, the, archdeacon, of, acre, the, three, of, them, hurried, to, return, to, the, holy, land, where, the, new, pope, entrusted, them, with, letters, for, the, great, khan, inviting, him, to, send, his, emissaries, to, rome, to, give, more, weight, to, this, mission, he, sent, with, the, polos, as, his, legates, two, dominican, fathers, guglielmo, of, tripoli, and, nicola, of, piacenza, they, continued, overland, until, they, arrived, at, kublai, khan, s, palace, in, shangdu, china, then, known, as, cathay, by, this, time, marco, was, 21, years, old, impressed, by, marco, s, intelligence, and, humility, kublai, appointed, him, to, serve, as,

the, emperor, s, lands, for, 17, years, kublai, initially, refused, several, times, to, let, the, polos, return, to, europe, as, he, appreciated, their, company, and, they, became, useful, to, him, however, around, 1291, he, finally, granted, permission, entrusting, the, polos, with, his, last, duty, accompany, the, mongol, princess, k, k, chin, who, was, to, become, the, consort, of, arghun,

in, 1296, off, the, anatolian, coast, between, adana, and, the, gulf, of, alexandretta, and, not, during, the, battle, of, curzola, september, 1298, off, the, dalmatian, coast, a, claim, which, is, due, to, a, later, tradition, 16th, century, recorded, by, giovanni, battista, ramusio, he, spent, several, months, of, his, imprisonment, dictating, a, detailed, account, of, his, travels, to, a, fellow, inmate, rustichello, da, pisa, who, incorporated, tales, of, his, own, as, well, as, other, collected, anecdotes, and, current, affairs, from, china, the, book, soon, spread, throughout,

astronomers, agree, that, there, were, no, comets, sighted, in, europe, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, but, there, are, records, about, a, comet, sighted, in, china, and, indonesia, in, 1293,

querini, among, whose, rebels, were, jacobello, and, francesco, polo, from, another, family, branch, is, unclear, polo, is, clearly, mentioned, again, after, 1305, in, maffeo, s, testament, from, 1309, to, 1310, in, a, 1319, document, according, to, which, he, became, owner, of, some, estates, of, his, deceased, father, and, in, 1321, when, he, bought, part, of, the, family, property, of, his,

his, assets, including, several, properties, among, individuals, religious, institutions, and, every, guild, and, fraternity, to, which, he, belonged, he, also, wrote, off, multiple, debts, including, 300, lire, that, his, sister, in, law, owed, him, and, others, for, the, convent, of, san, giovanni, san, paolo, of, the, order, of, preachers, and, a, cleric, named, friar, benvenuto, he, ordered, 220, soldi, be, paid, to, giovanni, giustiniani, for, his, work, as, a, notary, and, his, prayers, the, will, was, not, signed, by, polo, but, was, validated, by, the, then, relevant, signum, manus, rule, by, which, the, testator, had, only, to, touch, the, document, to, make, it, legally, valid, due, to, the, venetian, law, stating, that, the, day, ends, at, sunset, the, exact, date, of, marco, polo, s, death, cannot, be, determined, but, according, to, some, scholars, it, was, between, the, sunsets, of, 8, and, 9, january, 1324, biblioteca, marciana, which, holds, the, original, copy, of, his, testament, dates, the, testament, on, 9, january, 1323, and, gives, the, date, of, his, death, at, some, time, in, june, 1324, an, authoritative, version, of, marco, polo, s, book, does, not, and, cannot, exist, for, the, early, manuscripts, differ, significantly, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, original, text, is, a, matter, of, textual, criticism, a, total, of, about, 150, copies, in, various, languages, are, known, to, exist, before, the, availability, of, printing, press, errors, were, frequently, made, during, copying, and, translating, so, there, are, many, differences, between, the, various, copies, polo, related, his, memoirs, orally, to, rustichello, da, pisa, while, both, were, prisoners, of, the, genova, republic, rustichello, wrote, devisement, du, monde, in, franco, venetian, the, idea, probably, was, to, create, a, handbook, for, merchants, essentially, a, text, on, weights, measures, and, distances, the, oldest, surviving, manuscript, is, in, old, french, heavily, flavoured, with, italian, according, to, the, italian, scholar, luigi, foscolo, benedetto, this, f, text, is, the, basic, original, text, which, he, corrected, by, comparing, it, with, the, somewhat, more, detailed, italian, of, giovanni, battista, ramusio, together, with, a, latin, manuscript, in, the, biblioteca, ambrosiana, other, early, important, sources, are, r, ramusio, s, italian, translation, first, printed, in, 1559, and, z, a, 15th, century, latin, manuscript, kept, at, toledo, spain, another, old, french, polo, manuscript, dating, to, around, 1350, is, held, by, the, national, library, of, sweden, one, of, the, early, manuscripts, iter, marci, pauli, veneti, was, a, translation, into, latin, made, by, the, dominican, brother, francesco, pipino, in, 1302, just, a, few, years, after, marco, s, return, to, venice, since, latin, was, then, the, most, widespread, and, authoritative, language, of, culture, it, is, suggested, that, rustichello, s, text, was, translated, into, latin, for, a, precise, will, of, the, dominican, order, and, this, helped, to, promote, the, book, on, a, european, scale, the, first, english, translation, is, the, elizabethan, version, by, john, frampton, published, in, 1579, the, most, noble, and, famous, travels, of, marco, polo, based, on, santaella, s, castilian, translation, of, 1503, the, first, version, in, that, language, the, published, editions, of, polo, s, book, rely, on, single, manuscripts, blend, multiple, versions, together, or, add, notes, to, clarify, for, example, in, the, english, translation, by, henry, yule, the, 1938, english, translation, by, a, c, moule, and, paul, pelliot, is, based, on, a, latin, manuscript, found, in, the, library, of, the, cathedral, of, toledo, in, 1932, and, is, 50, longer, than, other, versions, the, popular, translation, published, by, penguin, books, in, 1958, by, r, e, latham, works, several, texts, together, to, make, a, readable, whole, sharon, kinoshita, s, 2016, version, takes, as, its, source, the, franco, italian, f, manuscript, and, invites, readers, to, focus, on, the, text, as, the, product, of, a, larger, european, and, eurasian, literary, and, commercial, culture, rather, than, questions, of, veracity, of, the, account, the, book, opens, with, a, preface, describing, his, father, and, uncle, travelling, to, bolghar, where, prince, berke, khan, lived, a, year, later, they, went, to, ukek, and, continued, to, bukhara, there, an, envoy, from, the, levant, invited, them, to, meet, kublai, khan, who, had, never, met, europeans, in, 1266, they, reached, the, seat, of, kublai, khan, at, dadu, present, day, beijing, china, kublai, received, the, brothers, with, hospitality, and, asked, them, many, questions, regarding, the, european, legal, and, political, system, he, also, inquired, about, the, pope, and, church, in, rome, after, the, brothers, answered, the, questions, he, tasked, them, with, delivering, a, letter, to, the, pope, requesting, 100, christians, acquainted, with, the, seven, arts, grammar, rhetoric, logic, geometry, arithmetic, music, and, astronomy, kublai, khan, requested, also, that, an, envoy, bring, him, back, oil, of, the, lamp, in, jerusalem, the, long, sede, vacante, between, the, death, of, pope, clement, iv, in, 1268, and, the, election, of, his, successor, delayed, the, polos, in, fulfilling, kublai, s, request, they, followed, the, suggestion, of, theobald, visconti, then, papal, legate, for, the, realm, of, egypt, and, returned, to, venice, in, 1269, or, 1270, to, await, the, nomination, of, the, new, pope, which, allowed, marco, to, see, his, father, for, the, first, time, at, the, age, of, fifteen, or, sixteen, in, 1271, niccol, maffeo, and, marco, polo, embarked, on, their, voyage, to, fulfil, kublai, s, request, they, sailed, to, acre, and, then, rode, on, camels, to, the, persian, port, of, hormuz, the, polos, wanted, to, sail, straight, into, china, but, the, ships, there, were, not, seaworthy, so, they, continued, overland, through, the, silk, road, until, reaching, kublai, s, summer, palace, in, shangdu, near, present, day, zhangjiakou, in, one, instance, during, their, trip, the, polos, joined, a, caravan, of, travelling, merchants, whom, they, crossed, paths, with, unfortunately, the, party, was, soon, attacked, by, bandits, who, used, the, cover, of, a, sandstorm, to, ambush, them, the, polos, managed, to, fight, and, escape, through, a, nearby, town, but, many, members, of, the, caravan, were, killed, or, enslaved, three, and, a, half, years, after, leaving, venice, when, marco, was, about, 21, years, old, the, polos, were, welcomed, by, kublai, into, his, palace, the, exact, date, of, their, arrival, is, unknown, but, scholars, estimate, it, to, be, between, 1271, and, 1275, on, reaching, the, yuan, court, the, polos, presented, the, sacred, oil, from, jerusalem, and, the, papal, letters, to, their, patron, marco, knew, four, languages, and, the, family, had, accumulated, a, great, deal, of, knowledge, and, experience, that, was, useful, to, kublai, it, is, possible, that, he, became, a, government, official, he, wrote, about, many, imperial, visits, to, china, s, southern, and, eastern, provinces, the, far, south, and, burma, they, were, highly, respected, and, sought, after, in, the, mongolian, court, and, so, kublai, khan, decided, to, decline, the, polos, requests, to, leave, china, they, became, worried, about, returning, home, safely, believing, that, if, kublai, died, his, enemies, might, turn, against, them, because, of, their, close, involvement, with, the, ruler, in, 1292, kublai, s, great, nephew, then, ruler, of, persia, sent, representatives, to, china, in, search, of, a, potential, wife, and, they, asked, the, polos, to, accompany, them, so, they, were, permitted, to, return, to, persia, with, the, wedding, party, which, left, that, same, year, from, zaitun, in, southern, china, on, a, fleet, of, 14, junks, the, party, sailed, to, the, port, of, singapore, travelled, north, to, sumatra, and, around, the, southern, tip, of, india, eventually, crossing, the, arabian, sea, to, hormuz, the, two, year, voyage, was, a, perilous, one, of, the, six, hundred, people, not, including, the, crew, in, the, convoy, only, eighteen, had, survived, including, all, three, polos, the, polos, left, the, wedding, party, after, reaching, hormuz, and, travelled, overland, to, the, port, of, trebizond, on, the, black, sea, the, present, day, trabzon, the, british, scholar, ronald, latham, has, pointed, out, that, the, book, of, marvels, was, a, collaboration, written, in, 1298, 1299, between, polo, and, a, professional, writer, of, romances, rustichello, of, pisa, it, is, believed, that, polo, related, his, memoirs, orally, to, rustichello, da, pisa, while, both, were, prisoners, of, the, genova, republic, rustichello, wrote, devisement, du, monde, in, franco, venetian, language, which, was, a, literary, only, language, widespread, in, northern, italy, between, the, subalpine, belt, and, the, lower, po, between, the, 13th, and, 15th, centuries, latham, also, argued, that, rustichello, may, have, glamorised, polo, s, accounts, and, added, fantastic, and, romantic, elements, that, made, the, book, a, bestseller, the, italian, scholar, luigi, foscolo, benedetto, had, previously, demonstrated, that, the, book, was, written, in, the, same, leisurely, conversational, style, that, characterised, rustichello, s, other, works, and, that, some, passages, in, the, book, were, taken, verbatim, or, with, minimal, modifications, from, other, writings, by, rustichello, for, example, the, opening, introduction, in, the, book, of, marvels, to, emperors, and, kings, dukes, and, marquises, was, lifted, straight, out, of, an, arthurian, romance, rustichello, had, written, several, years, earlier, and, the, account, of, the, second, meeting, between, polo, and, kublai, khan, at, the, latter, s, court, is, almost, the, same, as, that, of, the, arrival, of, tristan, at, the, court, of, king, arthur, at, camelot, in, that, same, book, latham, believed, that, many, elements, of, the, book, such, as, legends, of, the, middle, east, and, mentions, of, exotic, marvels, might, have, been, the, work, of, rustichello, who, was, giving, what, medieval, european, readers, expected, to, find, in, a, travel, book, apparently, from, the, very, beginning, marco, s, story, aroused, contrasting, reactions, as, it, was, received, by, some, with, a, certain, disbelief, the, dominican, father, francesco, pipino, was, the, author, of, a, translation, into, latin, iter, marci, pauli, veneti, in, 1302, just, a, few, years, after, marco, s, return, to, venice, francesco, pipino, solemnly, affirmed, the, truthfulness, of, the, book, and, defined, marco, as, a, prudent, honoured, and, faithful, man, in, his, writings, the, dominican, brother, jacopo, d, acqui, explains, why, his, contemporaries, were, sceptical, about, the, content, of, the, book, he, also, relates, that, before, dying, marco, polo, insisted, that, he, had, told, only, a, half, of, the, things, he, had, seen, according, to, some, recent, research, of, the, italian, scholar, antonio, montefusco, the, very, close, relationship, that, marco, polo, cultivated, with, members, of, the, dominican, order, in, venice, suggests, that, local, fathers, collaborated, with, him, for, a, latin, version, of, the, book, which, means, that, rustichello, s, text, was, translated, into, latin, for, a, precise, will, of, the, order, since, dominican, fathers, had, among, their, missions, that, of, evangelizing, foreign, peoples, cf, the, role, of, dominican, missionaries, in, china, and, in, the, indies, it, is, reasonable, to, think, that, they, considered, marco, s, book, as, a, trustworthy, piece, of, information, for, missions, in, the, east, the, diplomatic, communications, between, pope, innocent, iv, and, pope, gregory, x, with, the, mongols, were, probably, another, reason, for, this, endorsement, at, the, time, there, was, open, discussion, of, a, possible, christian, mongol, alliance, with, an, anti, islamic, function, a, mongol, delegate, was, solemnly, baptised, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, at, the, council, pope, gregory, x, promulgated, a, new, crusade, to, start, in, 1278, in, liaison, with, the, mongols, since, its, publication, some, have, viewed, the, book, with, skepticism, some, in, the, middle, ages, regarded, the, book, simply, as, a, romance, or, fable, due, largely, to, the, sharp, difference, of, its, descriptions, of, a, sophisticated, civilisation, in, china, to, other, early, accounts, by, giovanni, da, pian, del, carpine, and, william, of, rubruck, who, portrayed, the, mongols, as, barbarians, who, appeared, to, belong, to, some, other, world, doubts, have, also, been, raised, in, later, centuries, about, marco, polo, s, narrative, of, his, travels, in, china, for, example, for, his, failure, to, mention, the, great, wall, of, china, and, in, particular, the, difficulties, in, identifying, many, of, the, place, names, he, used, the, great, majority, however, have, since, been, identified, many, have, questioned, whether, he, had, visited, the, places, he, mentioned, in, his, itinerary, whether, he, had, appropriated, the, accounts, of, his, father, and, uncle, or, other, travellers, and, some, doubted, whether, he, even, reached, china, or, that, if, he, did, perhaps, never, went, beyond, khanbaliq, beijing, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, polo, s, accounts, of, china, are, more, accurate, and, detailed, than, other, travellers, accounts, of, the, period, polo, had, at, times, refuted, the, marvellous, fables, and, legends, given, in, other, european, accounts, and, despite, some, exaggerations, and, errors, polo, s, accounts, have, relatively, few, of, the, descriptions, of, irrational, marvels, in, many, cases, of, descriptions, of, events, where, he, was, not, present, mostly, given, in, the, first, part, before, he, reached, china, such, as, mentions, of, christian, miracles, he, made, a, clear, distinction, that, they, are, what, he, had, heard, rather, than, what, he, had, seen, it, is, also, largely, free, of, the, gross, errors, found, in, other, accounts, such, as, those, given, by, the, moroccan, traveller, ibn, battuta, who, had, confused, the, yellow, river, with, the, grand, canal, and, other, waterways, and, believed, that, porcelain, was, made, from, coal, modern, studies, have, further, shown, that, details, given, in, marco, polo, s, book, such, as, the, currencies, used, salt, productions, and, revenues, are, accurate, and, unique, such, detailed, descriptions, are, not, found, in, other, non, chinese, sources, and, their, accuracy, is, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, as, well, as, chinese, records, compiled, after, polo, had, left, china, his, accounts, are, therefore, unlikely, to, have, been, obtained, second, hand, other, accounts, have, also, been, verified, for, example, when, visiting, zhenjiang, in, jiangsu, china, marco, polo, noted, that, a, large, number, of, christian, churches, had, been, built, there, his, claim, is, confirmed, by, a, chinese, text, of, the, 14th, century, explaining, how, a, sogdian, named, mar, sargis, from, samarkand, founded, six, nestorian, christian, churches, there, in, addition, to, one, in, hangzhou, during, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, his, story, of, the, princess, k, k, chin, sent, from, china, to, persia, to, marry, the, l, kh, n, is, also, confirmed, by, independent, sources, in, both, persia, and, china, sceptics, have, long, wondered, whether, marco, polo, wrote, his, book, based, on, hearsay, with, some, pointing, to, omissions, about, noteworthy, practices, and, structures, of, china, as, well, as, the, lack, of, details, on, some, places, in, his, book, while, polo, describes, paper, money, and, the, burning, of, coal, he, fails, to, mention, the, great, wall, of, china, tea, chinese, characters, chopsticks, or, footbinding, his, failure, to, note, the, presence, of, the, great, wall, of, china, was, first, raised, in, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, and, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, it, was, suggested, that, he, had, never, reached, china, later, scholars, such, as, john, w, haeger, argued, that, marco, polo, might, not, have, visited, southern, china, in, view, of, the, lack, of, details, in, his, description, of, southern, chinese, cities, compared, to, northern, ones, while, herbert, franke, also, raised, the, possibility, that, marco, polo, had, not, been, to, china, at, all, and, wondered, if, he, had, based, his, accounts, on, persian, sources, in, view, of, his, use, of, persian, expressions, this, is, taken, further, by, frances, wood, who, claimed, in, her, 1995, book, did, marco, polo, go, to, china, that, at, best, polo, never, went, farther, east, than, persia, modern, iran, and, that, there, is, nothing, in, the, book, of, marvels, about, china, that, could, not, have, been, obtained, by, reading, persian, books, wood, maintains, that, it, is, more, probable, that, polo, went, only, to, constantinople, modern, istanbul, turkey, and, some, of, the, italian, merchant, colonies, around, the, black, sea, picking, hearsay, from, those, travellers, who, had, been, farther, east, supporters, of, polo, s, basic, accuracy, countered, on, the, points, raised, by, sceptics, such, as, footbinding, and, the, great, wall, of, china, historian, stephen, g, haw, argued, that, the, great, walls, were, built, to, keep, out, northern, invaders, whereas, the, ruling, dynasty, during, marco, polo, s, visit, were, those, very, northern, invaders, they, note, that, the, great, wall, familiar, to, us, today, is, a, ming, structure, built, some, two, centuries, after, marco, polo, s, travels, and, that, the, mongol, rulers, whom, polo, served, controlled, territories, both, north, and, south, of, today, s, wall, and, would, have, had, no, reasons, to, maintain, any, fortifications, that, might, have, remained, there, from, the, earlier, dynasties, other, europeans, who, travelled, to, khanbaliq, during, the, yuan, dynasty, such, as, giovanni, de, marignolli, and, odoric, of, pordenone, said, nothing, about, the, wall, either, the, muslim, traveller, ibn, battuta, who, asked, about, the, wall, when, he, visited, china, during, the, yuan, dynasty, could, find, no, one, who, either, had, seen, it, or, knew, of, anyone, who, had, seen, it, suggesting, that, while, ruins, of, the, wall, constructed, in, the, earlier, periods, might, have, existed, they, were, not, significant, or, noteworthy, at, that, time, haw, also, argued, that, footbinding, was, not, common, even, among, chinese, during, polo, s, time, and, almost, unknown, among, the, mongols, while, the, italian, missionary, odoric, of, pordenone, who, visited, yuan, china, mentioned, footbinding, it, is, however, unclear, whether, he, was, merely, relaying, something, he, had, heard, as, his, description, is, inaccurate, no, other, foreign, visitors, to, yuan, china, mentioned, the, practice, perhaps, an, indication, that, the, footbinding, was, not, widespread, or, was, not, practised, in, an, extreme, form, at, that, time, marco, polo, himself, noted, in, the, toledo, manuscript, the, dainty, walk, of, chinese, women, who, took, very, short, steps, it, has, also, been, noted, by, other, scholars, that, many, of, the, things, not, mentioned, by, marco, polo, such, as, tea, and, chopsticks, were, not, mentioned, by, other, travellers, either, haw, also, pointed, out, that, despite, the, few, omissions, marco, polo, s, account, is, more, extensive, more, accurate, and, more, detailed, than, those, of, other, foreign, travellers, to, china, in, this, period, marco, polo, even, observed, chinese, nautical, inventions, such, as, the, watertight, compartments, of, bulkhead, partitions, in, chinese, ships, knowledge, of, which, he, was, keen, to, share, with, his, fellow, venetians, in, addition, to, haw, other, scholars, have, argued, in, favour, of, the, established, view, that, polo, was, in, china, in, response, to, wood, s, book, the, book, has, been, criticized, by, figures, including, igor, de, rachewiltz, translator, and, annotator, of, the, secret, history, of, the, mongols, and, morris, rossabi, author, of, kublai, khan, his, life, and, times, the, historian, david, morgan, points, out, basic, errors, made, in, wood, s, book, such, as, confusing, the, liao, dynasty, with, the, jin, dynasty, and, he, found, no, compelling, evidence, in, the, book, that, would, convince, him, that, marco, polo, did, not, go, to, china, haw, also, argues, in, his, book, marco, polo, s, china, that, marco, s, account, is, much, more, correct, and, accurate, than, has, often, been, supposed, and, that, it, is, extremely, unlikely, that, he, could, have, obtained, all, the, information, in, his, book, from, secondhand, sources, haw, also, criticizes, wood, s, approach, to, finding, mention, of, marco, polo, in, chinese, texts, by, contending, that, contemporaneous, europeans, had, little, regard, for, using, surnames, and, that, a, direct, chinese, transliteration, of, the, name, marco, ignores, the, possibility, of, his, taking, on, a, chinese, or, even, mongol, name, with, no, similarity, to, his, latin, name, also, in, reply, to, wood, j, rgen, jensen, recalled, the, meeting, of, marco, polo, and, pietro, d, abano, in, the, late, 13th, century, during, this, meeting, marco, gave, to, pietro, details, of, the, astronomical, observations, he, had, made, on, his, journey, these, observations, are, compatible, with, marco, s, stay, in, china, sumatra, and, the, south, china, sea, and, are, recorded, in, pietro, s, book, conciliator, differentiarum, but, not, in, marco, s, book, of, travels, reviewing, haw, s, book, peter, jackson, author, of, the, mongols, and, the, west, has, said, that, haw, must, surely, now, have, settled, the, controversy, surrounding, the, historicity, of, polo, s, visit, to, china, igor, de, rachewiltz, s, review, which, refutes, wood, s, points, concludes, with, a, strongly, worded, condemnation, i, regret, to, say, that, f, w, s, book, falls, short, of, the, standard, of, scholarship, that, one, would, expect, in, a, work, of, this, kind, her, book, can, only, be, described, as, deceptive, both, in, relation, to, the, author, and, to, the, public, at, large, questions, are, posed, that, in, the, majority, of, cases, have, already, been, answered, satisfactorily, her, attempt, is, unprofessional, she, is, poorly, equipped, in, the, basic, tools, of, the, trade, i, e, adequate, linguistic, competence, and, research, methodology, and, her, major, arguments, cannot, withstand, close, scrutiny, her, conclusion, fails, to, consider, all, the, evidence, supporting, marco, polo, s, credibility, some, scholars, believe, that, marco, polo, exaggerated, his, importance, in, china, the, british, historian, david, morgan, thought, that, polo, had, likely, exaggerated, and, lied, about, his, status, in, china, while, ronald, latham, believed, that, such, exaggerations, were, embellishments, by, his, ghostwriter, rustichello, da, pisa, et, meser, marc, pol, meisme, celui, de, cui, trate, ceste, livre, seingneurie, ceste, cit, por, trois, anz, and, the, same, marco, polo, of, whom, this, book, relates, ruled, this, city, for, three, years, this, sentence, in, the, book, of, marvels, was, interpreted, as, marco, polo, was, the, governor, of, the, city, of, yangiu, yangzhou, for, three, years, and, later, of, hangzhou, this, claim, has, raised, some, controversy, according, to, david, morgan, no, chinese, source, mentions, him, as, either, a, friend, of, the, emperor, or, as, the, governor, of, yangzhou, indeed, no, chinese, source, mentions, marco, polo, at, all, in, the, 1960s, the, german, historian, herbert, franke, noted, that, all, occurrences, of, po, lo, or, bolod, in, yuan, texts, were, names, of, people, of, mongol, or, turkic, extraction, in, the, 2010s, the, chinese, scholar, peng, hai, claimed, to, have, identified, marco, polo, with, a, certain, boluo, b, lu, a, courtier, of, the, emperor, who, is, mentioned, in, volume, 119, of, the, history, of, yuan, yu, nsh, commissioned, by, the, succeeding, ming, dynasty, the, claim, arises, out, of, the, report, that, boluo, was, arrested, in, 1274, by, an, imperial, dignitary, named, saman, s, m, n, for, walking, on, the, same, side, of, the, road, as, a, female, courtesan, in, contravention, of, the, order, for, men, and, women, to, walk, on, opposite, sides, of, the, road, inside, the, city, according, to, the, history, of, yuan, boluo, was, released, at, the, request, of, the, emperor, himself, and, was, then, transferred, to, the, region, of, ningxia, in, the, northeast, of, present, day, china, in, the, spring, of, 1275, the, date, could, correspond, to, the, first, mission, of, which, marco, polo, speaks, if, this, identification, is, correct, there, is, a, record, about, marco, polo, in, chinese, sources, these, conjectures, seem, to, be, supported, by, the, fact, that, in, addition, to, the, imperial, dignitary, saman, the, one, who, had, arrested, the, official, named, boluo, the, documents, mention, his, brother, xiangwei, xi, ngw, i, according, to, sources, saman, died, shortly, after, the, incident, while, xiangwei, was, transferred, to, yangzhou, in, 1282, 1283, marco, polo, reports, that, he, was, moved, to, hangzhou, the, following, year, in, 1284, it, has, been, supposed, that, these, displacements, are, due, to, the, intention, to, avoid, further, conflicts, between, the, two, the, sinologist, paul, pelliot, thought, that, polo, might, have, served, as, an, officer, of, the, government, salt, monopoly, in, yangzhou, which, was, a, position, of, some, significance, that, could, explain, the, exaggeration, it, may, seem, unlikely, that, a, european, could, hold, a, position, of, power, in, the, mongolian, empire, some, records, prove, he, was, not, the, first, nor, the, only, one, in, his, book, marco, mentions, an, official, named, mar, sarchis, who, probably, was, a, nestorian, christian, bishop, and, he, says, he, founded, two, christian, churches, in, the, region, of, caigiu, this, official, is, actually, mentioned, in, the, local, gazette, zhishun, zhenjian, zhi, under, the, name, ma, xuelijisi, and, the, qualification, of, general, of, third, class, in, the, gazette, it, is, said, ma, xuelijsi, was, an, assistant, supervisor, in, the, province, of, zhenjiang, for, three, years, and, that, during, this, time, he, founded, two, christian, churches, it, is, a, well, documented, fact, that, kublai, khan, trusted, foreigners, more, than, his, chinese, subjects, in, internal, affairs, stephen, g, haw, challenges, this, idea, that, polo, exaggerated, his, own, importance, writing, that, contrary, to, what, has, often, been, said, marco, does, not, claim, any, very, exalted, position, for, himself, in, the, yuan, empire, he, points, out, that, polo, never, claimed, to, hold, high, rank, such, as, a, darughachi, who, led, a, tumen, a, unit, that, was, normally, 10, 000, strong, polo, does, not, even, imply, that, he, had, led, 1, 000, personnel, haw, points, out, that, polo, himself, appears, to, state, only, that, he, had, been, an, emissary, of, the, khan, in, a, position, with, some, esteem, according, to, haw, this, is, a, reasonable, claim, if, polo, was, for, example, a, keshig, a, member, of, the, imperial, guard, by, the, same, name, which, included, as, many, as, 14, 000, individuals, at, the, time, haw, explains, how, the, earliest, manuscripts, of, polo, s, accounts, provide, contradicting, information, about, his, role, in, yangzhou, with, some, stating, he, was, just, a, simple, resident, others, stating, he, was, a, governor, and, ramusio, s, manuscript, claiming, he, was, simply, holding, that, office, as, a, temporary, substitute, for, someone, else, yet, all, the, manuscripts, concur, that, he, worked, as, an, esteemed, emissary, for, the, khan, another, contradictory, claim, is, at, chapter, 145, when, the, book, of, marvels, states, that, the, three, polos, provided, the, mongols, with, technical, advice, on, building, mangonels, during, the, siege, of, xiangyang, adonc, distrent, les, ii, freres, et, lor, filz, meser, marc, grant, sire, nos, avon, avech, nos, en, nostre, mesnie, homes, qe, firont, tielz, mangan, qe, giteront, si, grant, pieres, qe, celes, de, la, cit, ne, poront, sofrir, mes, se, renderont, maintenant, then, the, two, brothers, and, their, son, marc, said, great, lord, in, our, entourage, we, have, men, who, will, build, such, mangonels, which, launch, such, great, stones, that, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, will, not, endure, it, and, will, immediately, surrender, since, the, siege, was, over, in, 1273, before, marco, polo, had, arrived, in, china, for, the, first, time, the, claim, cannot, be, true, the, mongol, army, that, besieged, xiangyang, did, have, foreign, military, engineers, but, they, were, mentioned, in, chinese, sources, as, being, from, baghdad, and, had, arabic, names, in, this, respect, igor, de, rachewiltz, recalls, that, the, claim, that, the, three, polo, were, present, at, the, siege, of, xiang, yang, is, not, present, in, all, manuscripts, but, niccol, and, matteo, could, have, made, this, suggestion, therefore, this, claim, seems, a, subsequent, addition, to, give, more, credibility, to, the, story, a, number, of, errors, in, marco, polo, s, account, have, been, noted, for, example, he, described, the, bridge, later, known, as, marco, polo, bridge, as, having, twenty, four, arches, instead, of, eleven, or, thirteen, he, also, said, that, city, wall, of, khanbaliq, had, twelve, gates, when, it, had, only, eleven, archaeologists, have, also, pointed, out, that, polo, may, have, mixed, up, the, details, from, the, two, attempted, invasions, of, japan, by, kublai, khan, in, 1274, and, 1281, polo, wrote, of, five, masted, ships, when, archaeological, excavations, found, that, the, ships, had, only, three, masts, historian, frances, wood, accused, marco, polo, of, taking, other, people, s, accounts, in, his, book, retelling, other, stories, as, his, own, or, basing, his, accounts, on, persian, guidebooks, or, other, lost, sources, for, example, sinologist, francis, woodman, cleaves, noted, that, polo, s, account, of, the, voyage, of, the, princess, k, k, chin, from, china, to, persia, to, marry, the, l, kh, n, in, 1293, has, been, confirmed, by, a, passage, in, the, 15th, century, chinese, work, yongle, encyclopedia, and, by, the, persian, historian, rashid, al, din, hamadani, in, his, work, jami, al, tawarikh, however, neither, of, these, accounts, mentions, polo, or, indeed, any, european, as, part, of, the, bridal, party, and, wood, used, the, lack, of, mention, of, polo, in, these, works, as, an, example, of, polo, s, retelling, of, a, well, known, tale, david, o, morgan, in, polo, s, defence, noted, that, even, the, princess, herself, was, not, mentioned, in, the, chinese, source, and, that, it, would, have, been, surprising, if, polo, had, been, mentioned, by, rashid, al, din, historian, igor, de, rachewiltz, strongly, criticised, wood, s, arguments, in, his, review, of, her, book, rachewiltz, argued, that, marco, polo, s, account, allows, the, persian, and, chinese, sources, to, be, reconciled, by, relaying, the, information, that, two, of, the, three, envoys, sent, mentioned, in, the, chinese, source, and, whose, names, accord, with, those, given, by, polo, had, died, during, the, voyage, it, explains, why, only, the, third, who, survived, coja, khoja, was, mentioned, by, rash, d, al, d, n, polo, had, therefore, completed, the, story, by, providing, information, not, found, in, either, source, he, also, noted, that, the, only, persian, source, that, mentions, the, princess, was, not, completed, until, 1310, 11, therefore, marco, polo, could, not, have, learned, the, information, from, any, persian, book, according, to, de, rachewiltz, the, concordance, of, polo, s, detailed, account, of, the, princess, with, other, independent, sources, that, gave, only, incomplete, information, is, proof, of, the, veracity, of, polo, s, story, and, his, presence, in, china, morgan, writes, that, since, much, of, what, the, book, of, marvels, has, to, say, about, china, is, demonstrably, correct, any, claim, that, polo, did, not, go, to, china, creates, far, more, problems, than, it, solves, therefore, the, balance, of, probabilities, strongly, suggests, that, polo, really, did, go, to, china, even, if, he, exaggerated, somewhat, his, importance, in, china, haw, dismisses, the, various, anachronistic, criticisms, of, polo, s, accounts, that, started, in, the, 17th, century, and, highlights, polo, s, accuracy, in, great, part, of, his, accounts, for, example, on, features, of, the, landscape, such, as, the, grand, canal, of, china, if, marco, was, a, liar, haw, writes, then, he, must, have, been, an, implausibly, meticulous, one, in, 2012, the, university, of, t, bingen, sinologist, and, historian, hans, ulrich, vogel, released, a, detailed, analysis, of, polo, s, description, of, currencies, salt, production, and, revenues, and, argued, that, the, evidence, supports, his, presence, in, china, because, he, included, details, which, he, could, not, have, otherwise, known, vogel, noted, that, no, other, western, arab, or, persian, sources, have, given, such, accurate, and, unique, details, about, the, currencies, of, china, for, example, the, shape, and, size, of, the, paper, the, use, of, seals, the, various, denominations, of, paper, money, as, well, as, variations, in, currency, usage, in, different, regions, of, china, such, as, the, use, of, cowry, shells, in, yunnan, details, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, and, chinese, sources, compiled, long, after, the, polos, had, left, china, his, accounts, of, salt, production, and, revenues, from, the, salt, monopoly, are, also, accurate, and, accord, with, chinese, documents, of, the, yuan, era, economic, historian, mark, elvin, in, his, preface, to, vogel, s, 2013, monograph, concludes, that, vogel, demonstrates, by, specific, example, after, specific, example, the, ultimately, overwhelming, probability, of, the, broad, authenticity, of, polo, s, account, many, problems, were, caused, by, the, oral, transmission, of, the, original, text, and, the, proliferation, of, significantly, different, hand, copied, manuscripts, for, instance, did, polo, exert, political, authority, seignora, in, yangzhou, or, merely, sojourn, sejourna, there, elvin, concludes, that, those, who, doubted, although, mistaken, were, not, always, being, casual, or, foolish, but, the, case, as, a, whole, had, now, been, closed, the, book, is, in, essence, authentic, and, when, used, with, care, in, broad, terms, to, be, trusted, as, a, serious, though, obviously, not, always, final, witness, other, lesser, known, european, explorers, had, already, travelled, to, china, such, as, giovanni, da, pian, del, carpine, but, polo, s, book, meant, that, his, journey, was, the, first, to, be, widely, known, christopher, columbus, was, inspired, enough, by, polo, s, description, of, the, far, east, to, want, to, visit, those, lands, for, himself, a, copy, of, the,

in, three, years, across, central, asia, he, never, found, the, kingdom, but, ended, his, travels, at, the, great, wall, of, china, in, 1605, proving, that, cathay, was, what, matteo, ricci, 1552, 1610, called, china, marco, polo, s, travels, may, have, had, some, influence, on, the, development, of, european, cartography, ultimately, leading, to, the, european, voyages, of, exploration, a, century, later, the, 1453, fra, mauro, map, was, said, by, giovanni, battista, ramusio, disputed, by, historian, cartographer, piero, falchetta, in, whose, work, the, quote, appears, to, have, been, partially, based, on, the, one, brought, from, cathay, by, marco, polo, that, fine, illuminated, world, map, on, parchment, which, can, still, be, seen, in, a, large, cabinet, alongside, the, choir, of, their, monastery, was, by, one, of, the, brothers, of, the, monastery, who, took, great, delight, in, the, study, of, cosmography, diligently, drawn, and, copied, from, a, most, beautiful, and, very, old, nautical, map, and, a, world, map, that, had, been, brought, from, cathay, by, the, most, honourable, messer, marco, polo, and, his, father, though, marco, polo, never, produced, a, map, that, illustrated, his, journey, his, family, drew, several, maps, of, the, far, east, based, on, the, traveller, s, accounts, these, collections, of, maps, were, signed, by, polo, s, three,

the, coastlines, of, alaska, centuries, before, the, rediscovery, of, the, americas, by, europeans, there, is, a, legend, about, marco, polo, importing, pasta, from, china, however, it, is, actually, a, popular, misconception, originating, with, the, macaroni, journal, published, by, a, food, industry, association, with, the, goal, of, promoting, the, use, of, pasta, in, the, united, states, marco, polo, describes, in, his, book, a, food, similar, to, lasagna, but, he, uses, a, term, with, which, he, was, already, familiar, pasta, had, already, been, invented, in, italy, a, long, time, before, marco, polo, s, travels, to, asia, according, to, the, newsletter, of, the, national, macaroni, manufacturers, association, and, food, writer, jeffrey, steingarten, the, durum, wheat, was, introduced, by, arabs, from, libya, during, their, rule, over, sicily, in, the, late, 9th, century, thus, predating, marco, polo, s, travels, by, about, four, centuries, steingarten, also, mentioned,
