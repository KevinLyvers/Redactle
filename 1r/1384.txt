strangers, remote, distant, and, unable, to, discipline, him, wherever, he, went, grown, men, would, kneel, down, in, a, ritual, kowtow, averting, their, eyes, until, he, passed, soon, he, discovered, the, absolute, power, he, wielded, over, the, eunuchs, and, he, frequently, had, them, beaten, for, small, transgressions, as, an, emperor, puyi, s, every, whim, was, catered, to, while, no, one, ever, said, no, to, him, making, him, into, a, sadistic, boy, who, loved, to, have, his, eunuchs, flogged, or, forced, to, eat, dirt, the, anglo, french, journalist, edward, behr, wrote, about, puyi, s, power, as, emperor, of, china, which, allowed, him, to, fire, his, air, gun, at, anyone, he, liked, the, emperor, was, divine, he, could, not, be, remonstrated, with, or, punished, he, could, only, be, deferentially, advised, against, ill, treating, innocent, eunuchs, and, if, he, chose, to, fire, air, gun, pellets, at, them, that, was, his, prerogative, puyi, later, said, flogging, eunuchs, was, part, of, my, daily, routine, my, cruelty, and, love, of, wielding, power, were, already, too, firmly, set, for, persuasion, to, have, any, effect, on, me, wang, was, the, only, person, capable, of, controlling, puyi, once, puyi, decided, to, reward, a, eunuch, for, a, well, done, puppet, show, by, having, a, cake, baked, for, him, with, iron, filings, in, it, saying, i, want, to, see, what, he, looks, like, when, he, eats, it, with, much, difficulty, wang, talked, puyi, out, of, this, plan, every, day, puyi, had, to, visit, five, former, imperial, concubines, called, his, mothers, to, report, on, his, progress, he, hated, his, mothers, not, least, because, they, prevented, him, from, seeing, his, real, mother, until, he, was, 13, their, leader, was, the, autocratic, empress, dowager, longyu, who, successfully, conspired, to, have, puyi, s, beloved, wet, nurse, wang, expelled, from, the, forbidden, city, when, he, was, 8, on, the, grounds, that, puyi, was, too, old, to, be, breast, fed, puyi, especially, hated, longyu, for, that, puyi, later, wrote, although, i, had, many, mothers, i, never, knew, any, motherly, love, empress, dowager, longyu, ruled, with, paramount, authority, over, the, qing, imperial, court, and, though, she, was, not, the, de, jure, regent, she, was, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, qing, empire, puyi, had, a, standard, confucian, education, being, taught, the, various, chinese, classics, and, nothing, else, he, later, wrote, i, learnt, nothing, of, mathematics, let, alone, science, and, for, a, long, time, i, had, no, idea, where, peking, was, situated, when, puyi, was, 13, he, met, his, parents, and, siblings, all, of, whom, had, to, kowtow, before, him, as, he, sat, upon, the, dragon, throne, by, this, time, he, had, forgotten, what, his, mother, looked, like, such, was, the, awe, in, which, the, emperor, was, held, that, his, younger, brother, pujie, never, heard, his, parents, refer, to, puyi, as, your, elder, brother, but, only, as, the, emperor, pujie, told, behr, his, image, of, puyi, prior, to, meeting, him, was, that, of, a, venerable, old, man, with, a, beard, i, couldn, t, believe, it, when, i, saw, this, boy, in, yellow, robes, sitting, solemnly, on, the, throne, although, puyi, could, see, his, family, this, happened, rarely, and, always, under, the, stifling, rules, of, imperial, etiquette, the, consequence, was, that, the, relationship, of, the, emperor, with, his, parents, was, distant, and, he, found, himself, more, attached, to, his, nurse, miss, wang, who, had, accompanied, him, to, the, forbidden, city, later, puyi, began, to, receive, visits, from, his, brothers, and, cousins, who, provided, a, certain, air, of, normality, to, his, unique, childhood, separated, from, his, family, puyi, lived, his, childhood, in, a, regime, of, virtual, seclusion, in, the, forbidden, city, surrounded, by, guards, eunuchs, and, other, servants, who, treated, him, like, a, god, the, emperor, s, upbringing, was, a, mixture, of, pampering, and, mistreatment, as, he, was, required, to, follow, all, the, rules, of, rigid, chinese, imperial, protocol, and, was, unable, to, behave, like, a, normal, child, the, eunuchs, were, virtual, slaves, who, did, all, the, work, in, the, forbidden, city, such, as, cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining, guests, and, the, bureaucratic, work, needed, to, govern, a, vast, empire, they, also, served, as, the, emperor, s, advisers, the, forbidden, city, was, full, of, treasures, that, the, eunuchs, constantly, stole, and, sold, on, the, black, market, the, business, of, government, and, of, providing, for, the, emperor, created, further, opportunities, for, corruption, in, which, virtually, all, the, eunuchs, engaged, puyi, never, had, any, privacy, and, had, all, his, needs, attended, to, at, all, times, having, eunuchs, open, doors, for, him, dress, him, wash, him, and, even, blow, air, into, his, soup, to, cool, it, at, his, meals, puyi, was, always, presented, with, a, huge, buffet, containing, every, conceivable, dish, the, vast, majority, of, which, he, did, not, eat, and, every, day, he, wore, new, clothing, as, chinese, emperors, never, reused, their, clothing, after, his, wedding, puyi, began, to, take, control, of, the, palace, he, described, an, orgy, of, looting, taking, place, that, involved, everyone, from, the, highest, to, the, lowest, according, to, puyi, by, the, end, of, his, wedding, ceremony, the, pearls, and, jade, in, the, empress, s, crown, had, been, stolen, locks, were, broken, areas, ransacked, puyi, s, next, plan, of, action, was, to, reform, the, household, department, in, this, period, he, brought, in, more, outsiders, to, replace, the, traditional, aristocratic, officers, to, improve, accountability, he, appointed, zheng, xiaoxu, as, minister, of, household, department, and, zheng, xiaoxu, hired, tong, jixu, a, former, air, force, officer, from, the, beiyang, army, as, his, chief, of, staff, to, help, with, the, reforms, but, on, 27, june, 1923, a, fire, destroyed, the, area, around, the, palace, of, established, happiness, just, at, the, moment, when, the, emperor, had, ordered, to, carry, out, the, inventory, of, one, of, the, imperial, warehouses, puyi, suspected, it, was, arson, to, cover, theft, the, emperor, overheard, conversations, among, the, eunuchs, that, made, him, fear, for, his, life, in, response, a, month, after, the, fire, he, evicted, the, eunuchs, from, the, palace, with, the, support, of, the, beiyang, army, the, reform, efforts, did, not, last, long, before, puyi, was, forced, out, of, the, forbidden, city, by, feng, yuxiang, on, 10, october, 1911, the, army, garrison, in, wuhan, mutinied, sparking, a, widespread, revolt, in, the, yangtze, river, valley, and, beyond, demanding, the, overthrow, of, the, qing, dynasty, that, had, ruled, china, since, 1644, the, strongman, general, yuan, shikai, was, dispatched, by, the, court, to, crush, the, revolution, but, was, unable, to, as, by, 1911, public, opinion, had, turned, decisively, against, the, qing, and, many, chinese, had, no, wish, to, fight, for, a, dynasty, that, was, seen, as, having, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, puyi, s, father, prince, chun, served, as, a, regent, until, 6, december, when, empress, dowager, longyu, took, over, following, the, xinhai, revolution, empress, dowager, longyu, endorsed, the, imperial, edict, of, the, abdication, of, the, qing, emperor, on, 12, february, 1912, under, a, deal, brokered, by, yuan, now, prime, minister, with, the, imperial, court, in, beijing, and, the, republicans, in, southern, china, puyi, recalled, in, his, autobiography, the, meeting, between, longyu, and, yuan, the, dowager, empress, was, sitting, on, a, kang, in, a, side, room, of, the, mind, nature, palace, wiping, her, eyes, with, a, handkerchief, as, a, fat, old, man, knelt, before, her, on, a, red, cushion, tears, streaming, down, his, face, i, was, sitting, to, the, right, of, the, widow, and, wondering, why, both, adults, were, crying, there, was, no, one, in, the, room, other, than, the, three, of, us, and, everything, was, very, quiet, the, fat, man, snorted, as, he, spoke, and, i, couldn, t, understand, what, he, was, saying, this, was, the, time, when, yuan, directly, raised, the, question, of, abdication, under, the, articles, of, favourable, treatment, of, the, great, qing, emperor, after, his, abdication, signed, with, the, new, republic, of, china, puyi, was, to, retain, his, imperial, title, and, be, treated, by, the, government, of, the, republic, with, the, protocol, attached, to, a, foreign, monarch, puyi, and, the, imperial, court, were, allowed, to, remain, in, the, northern, half, of, the, forbidden, city, the, private, apartments, as, well, as, in, the, summer, palace, a, hefty, annual, subsidy, of, four, million, silver, taels, was, granted, by, the, republic, to, the, imperial, household, although, it, was, never, fully, paid, and, was, abolished, after, just, a, few, years, puyi, was, not, informed, in, february, 1912, that, his, reign, had, ended, and, china, was, now, a, republic, and, continued, to, believe, that, he, was, still, emperor, for, some, time, in, 1913, when, empress, dowager, longyu, died, president, yuan, arrived, at, the, forbidden, city, to, pay, his, respects, which, puyi, s, tutors, told, him, meant, that, major, changes, were, afoot, puyi, soon, learned, that, the, real, reasons, for, the, articles, of, favourable, settlement, was, that, president, yuan, was, planning, on, restoring, the, monarchy, with, himself, as, the, emperor, of, a, new, dynasty, and, wanted, to, have, puyi, as, a, sort, of, custodian, of, the, forbidden, city, until, he, could, move, in, puyi, first, learned, of, yuan, s, plans, to, become, emperor, when, he, brought, in, army, bands, to, serenade, him, whenever, he, had, a, meal, and, he, started, on, a, decidedly, imperial, take, on, the, presidency, puyi, spent, hours, staring, at, the, presidential, palace, across, from, the, forbidden, city, and, cursed, yuan, whenever, he, saw, him, come, and, go, in, his, car, puyi, loathed, yuan, as, a, traitor, and, decided, to, sabotage, his, plans, to, become, emperor, by, hiding, the, imperial, seals, only, to, be, told, by, his, tutors, that, he, would, just, make, new, ones, in, 1915, yuan, proclaimed, himself, as, emperor, and, he, was, planning, to, marry, his, daughter, to, puyi, but, had, to, abdicate, in, the, face, of, popular, opposition, in, 1917, the, warlord, zhang, xun, restored, puyi, to, the, throne, from, 1, july, to, 12, july, zhang, xun, ordered, his, army, to, keep, their, queues, to, display, loyalty, to, the, emperor, however, then, premier, of, the, republic, of, china, duan, qirui, ordered, a, caudron, type, d, plane, piloted, by, pan, shizhong, with, bombardier, du, yuyuan, from, nanyuan, airfield, to, drop, three, bombs, over, the, forbidden, city, as, a, show, of, force, against, zhang, xun, causing, the, death, of, a, eunuch, but, otherwise, inflicting, minor, damage, this, is, the, first, aerial, bombardment, recorded, by, a, chinese, air, force, and, the, restoration, failed, due, to, extensive, opposition, across, china, on, 3, march, 1919, the, scottish, scholar, and, diplomat, reginald, johnston, arrived, in, the, forbidden, city, to, serve, as, puyi, s, tutor, president, xu, shichang, believed, the, monarchy, would, eventually, be, restored, and, to, prepare, puyi, for, the, challenges, of, the, modern, world, had, hired, johnston, to, teach, puyi, subjects, such, as, political, science, constitutional, history, and, english, johnston, was, allowed, only, five, texts, in, english, to, give, puyi, to, read, alice, in, wonderland, and, translations, into, english, of, the, four, great, books, of, confucianism, the, analects, the, mencius, the, great, learning, and, the, doctrine, of, the, mean, but, he, disregarded, the, rules, and, taught, puyi, about, world, history, with, a, special, focus, on, british, history, besides, history, johnston, taught, puyi, philosophy, and, about, what, he, saw, as, the, superiority, of, monarchies, to, republics, puyi, remembered, that, his, tutor, s, piercing, blue, eyes, made, me, feel, uneasy, i, found, him, very, intimidating, and, studied, english, with, him, like, a, good, boy, not, daring, to, talk, about, other, things, when, i, got, bored, as, i, did, with, my, other, chinese, tutors, as, the, only, person, capable, of, controlling, puyi, johnston, had, much, more, influence, than, his, title, of, english, tutor, would, suggest, as, the, eunuchs, began, to, rely, on, him, to, steer, puyi, away, from, his, more, capricious, moods, under, the, scotsman, s, influence, puyi, started, to, insist, that, his, eunuchs, address, him, as, henry, and, later, his, wife, wanrong, as, elizabeth, as, puyi, began, to, speak, chinglish, a, mixture, of, mandarin, and, english, that, became, his, preferred, mode, of, speech, puyi, recalled, of, johnston, i, thought, everything, about, him, was, first, rate, he, made, me, feel, that, westerners, were, the, most, intelligent, and, civilised, people, in, the, world, and, that, he, was, the, most, learned, of, westerners, and, that, johnston, had, become, the, major, part, of, my, soul, in, may, 1919, puyi, noticed, the, protests, in, beijing, generated, by, the, may, 4th, movement, as, thousands, of, chinese, university, students, protested, against, the, decision, by, the, great, powers, at, the, paris, peace, conference, to, award, the, former, german, concessions, in, shandong, together, with, the, former, german, colony, of, qingdao, to, japan, for, puyi, the, may, 4th, movement, which, he, asked, johnston, about, was, a, revelation, as, it, marked, the, first, time, in, his, life, that, he, noticed, that, people, outside, the, forbidden, city, had, concerns, that, were, not, about, him, after, his, first, interview, with, the, emperor, the, british, academic, recorded, his, impressions, in, a, report, addressed, to, the, british, authorities, in, this, document, johnston, mentions, he, appears, to, be, physically, robust, and, well, developed, for, his, age, he, is, a, very, human, boy, with, liveliness, intelligence, and, an, enthusiastic, sense, of, humour, furthermore, he, has, excellent, manners, and, is, totally, free, from, arrogance, although, the, emperor, does, not, seem, to, have, been, spoiled, yet, from, the, nonsense, and, futility, that, surrounds, him, i, am, afraid, there, is, no, hope, that, he, will, emerge, unscathed, from, the, moral, dangers, through, of, the, next, few, years, of, his, life, very, critical, years, necessarily, for, a, boy, in, his, early, adolescence, unless, he, can, be, removed, from, the, influence, of, the, hordes, of, eunuchs, and, other, useless, officials, who, are, now, almost, his, only, companions, i, am, inclined, to, think, that, the, best, course, of, action, to, take, in, the, interest, of, the, boy, himself, would, be, to, remove, him, from, the, harmful, atmosphere, of, the, forbidden, city, and, send, him, to, the, summer, palace, there, it, would, be, possible, for, him, to, live, a, much, less, artificial, and, happier, life, than, he, can, under, the, present, conditions, puyi, could, not, speak, manchu, he, only, knew, a, single, word, in, the, language, yili, arise, despite, studying, manchu, for, years, he, admitted, that, it, was, his, worst, subject, among, everything, he, studied, according, to, the, journalist, syed, mohammad, ali, puyi, spoke, mandarin, when, interviewed, but, ali, believed, he, could, understand, english, johnston, also, introduced, puyi, to, the, new, technology, of, cinema, and, puyi, was, so, delighted, with, the, movies, especially, harold, lloyd, films, that, he, had, a, film, projector, installed, in, the, forbidden, city, despite, the, opposition, of, the, eunuchs, johnston, was, also, the, first, to, argue, that, puyi, needed, glasses, since, he, had, developed, myopia, as, he, was, extremely, near, sighted, and, after, much, argument, with, prince, chun, who, thought, it, was, undignified, for, an, emperor, finally, prevailed, johnston, who, spoke, fluent, mandarin, closely, followed, the, intellectual, scene, in, china, and, introduced, puyi, to, the, new, style, chinese, books, and, magazines, which, so, inspired, puyi, that, he, wrote, several, poems, that, were, published, anonymously, in, new, china, publications, in, 1922, johnston, had, his, friend, the, writer, hu, shih, visit, the, forbidden, city, to, teach, puyi, about, recent, developments, in, chinese, literature, under, johnston, s, influence, puyi, embraced, the, bicycle, as, a, way, to, exercise, cut, his, queue, and, grew, a, full, head, of, hair, and, wanted, to, study, at, the, university, of, oxford, johnston, s, alma, mater, johnston, also, introduced, puyi, to, the, telephone, which, puyi, soon, became, addicted, to, phoning, people, in, beijing, at, random, just, to, hear, their, voices, on, the, other, end, johnston, also, pressured, puyi, to, cut, down, on, the, waste, and, extravagance, in, the, forbidden, city, and, encouraged, him, to, be, more, self, sufficient, in, march, 1922, the, dowager, consorts, decided, that, puyi, should, be, married, and, gave, him, a, selection, of, photographs, of, aristocratic, teenage, girls, to, choose, from, puyi, first, chose, erdet, wenxiu, as, his, wife, but, was, told, that, she, was, acceptable, only, as, a, concubine, so, he, would, have, to, choose, again, puyi, later, claimed, that, the, faces, were, too, small, to, distinguish, between, puyi, then, chose, gobulo, wanrong, the, daughter, of, one, of, manchuria, s, richest, aristocrats, who, had, been, educated, in, english, by, american, missionaries, in, tianjin, who, was, considered, to, be, an, acceptable, empress, by, the, dowager, consorts, on, 15, march, 1922, the, betrothal, of, puyi, and, wanrong, was, announced, in, the, newspapers, on, 17, march, wanrong, took, the, train, to, beijing, and, on, 6, april, puyi, went, to, the, qing, family, shrine, to, inform, his, ancestors, that, he, would, be, married, to, her, later, that, year, puyi, did, not, meet, wanrong, until, their, wedding, in, an, interview, in, 1986, prince, pujie, told, behr, puyi, constantly, talked, about, going, to, england, and, becoming, an, oxford, student, like, johnston, on, 4, june, 1922, puyi, attempted, to, escape, from, the, forbidden, city, and, planned, to, issue, an, open, letter, to, the, people, of, china, renouncing, the, title, of, emperor, before, leaving, for, oxford, the, escape, attempt, failed, when, johnston, vetoed, it, and, refused, to, call, a, taxi, and, puyi, was, too, frightened, to, live, on, the, streets, of, beijing, on, his, own, pujie, said, of, puyi, s, escape, attempt, puyi, s, decision, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, impending, marriage, he, felt, cooped, up, and, wanted, out, johnston, later, recounted, his, time, as, puyi, s, tutor, between, 1919, and, 1924, in, his, 1934, book, twilight, in, the, forbidden, city, one, of, the, main, sources, of, information, about, puyi, s, life, in, this, period, though, behr, cautioned, that, johnston, painted, an, idealised, picture, of, puyi, avoiding, all, mention, of, puyi, s, sexuality, merely, average, academic, ability, erratic, mood, swings, and, eunuch, flogging, pujie, told, behr, of, puyi, s, moods, when, he, was, in, a, good, mood, everything, was, fine, and, he, was, a, charming, companion, if, something, upset, him, his, dark, side, would, emerge, on, 21, october, 1922, puyi, s, wedding, to, princess, wanrong, began, with, the, betrothal, presents, of, 18, sheep, 2, horses, 40, pieces, of, satin, and, 80, rolls, of, cloth, marched, from, the, forbidden, city, to, wanrong, s, house, accompanied, by, court, musicians, and, cavalry, following, manchu, traditions, where, weddings, were, conducted, under, moonlight, for, good, luck, an, enormous, procession, of, palace, guardsmen, eunuchs, and, musicians, carried, the, princess, wanrong, in, a, red, sedan, chair, called, the, phoenix, chair, within, the, forbidden, city, where, puyi, sat, upon, the, dragon, throne, later, wanrong, kowtowed, to, him, six, times, in, her, living, quarters, to, symbolize, her, submission, to, her, husband, as, the, decree, of, their, marriage, was, read, out, wanrong, wore, a, mask, in, accordance, with, chinese, tradition, and, puyi, who, knew, nothing, of, women, remembered, i, hardly, thought, about, marriage, and, family, it, was, only, when, the, empress, came, into, my, field, of, vision, with, a, crimson, satin, cloth, embroidered, with, a, dragon, and, a, phoenix, over, her, head, that, i, felt, at, all, curious, about, what, she, looked, like, after, the, wedding, was, complete, puyi, wanrong, and, his, secondary, consort, wenxiu, whom, he, married, the, same, night, went, to, the, palace, of, earthly, tranquility, where, everything, was, red, the, colour, of, love, and, sex, in, china, and, where, emperors, had, traditionally, consummated, their, marriages, puyi, who, was, sexually, inexperienced, and, timid, fled, from, the, bridal, chamber, leaving, his, wives, to, sleep, in, the, dragon, bed, by, themselves, of, puyi, s, failure, to, consummate, his, marriage, on, his, wedding, night, behr, wrote, it, was, perhaps, too, much, to, expect, an, adolescent, permanently, surrounded, by, eunuchs, to, show, the, sexual, maturity, of, a, normal, seventeen, year, old, neither, the, dowager, consorts, nor, johnston, himself, had, given, him, any, advice, on, sexual, matters, this, sort, of, thing, simply, was, not, done, where, emperors, were, concerned, it, would, have, been, an, appalling, breach, of, protocol, but, the, fact, remains, that, a, totally, inexperienced, over, sheltered, adolescent, if, normal, could, hardly, have, failed, to, be, aroused, by, wan, jung, s, unusual, sensual, beauty, the, inference, is, of, course, that, pu, yi, was, either, impotent, extraordinarily, immature, sexually, or, already, aware, of, his, homosexual, tendencies, wanrong, s, younger, brother, rong, qi, remembered, how, puyi, and, wanrong, both, teenagers, loved, to, race, their, bicycles, through, the, forbidden, city, forcing, eunuchs, to, get, out, of, the, way, and, told, behr, in, an, interview, there, was, a, lot, of, laughter, she, and, puyi, seemed, to, get, on, well, they, were, like, kids, together, in, 1986, behr, interviewed, one, of, puyi, s, two, surviving, eunuchs, an, 85, year, old, who, was, reluctant, to, answer, the, questions, asked, of, him, but, finally, said, of, puyi, s, relationship, with, wanrong, the, emperor, would, come, over, to, the, nuptial, apartments, once, every, three, months, and, spend, the, night, there, he, left, early, in, the, morning, on, the, following, day, and, for, the, rest, of, that, day, he, would, invariably, be, in, a, very, filthy, temper, indeed, a, eunuch, who, served, in, the, forbidden, city, as, wanrong, s, personal, servant, later, wrote, in, his, memoir, that, there, was, a, rumour, among, the, eunuchs, that, puyi, was, gay, noting, a, strange, situation, where, he, was, asked, by, puyi, to, stand, inside, wanrong, s, room, while, puyi, groped, her, another, eunuch, claimed, that, puyi, preferred, the, land, way, of, the, eunuchs, to, the, water, way, of, the, empress, implying, he, was, gay, puyi, rarely, left, the, forbidden, city, knew, nothing, of, the, lives, of, ordinary, chinese, people, and, was, somewhat, misled, by, johnston, who, told, him, that, the, vast, majority, of, the, chinese, wanted, a, qing, restoration, johnston, a, sinophile, scholar, and, a, romantic, conservative, with, an, instinctive, preference, for, monarchies, believed, that, china, needed, a, benevolent, autocrat, to, guide, the, country, forward, he, was, enough, of, a, traditionalist, to, respect, that, all, major, events, in, the, forbidden, city, were, determined, by, the, court, astrologers, johnston, disparaged, the, superficially, westernised, chinese, republican, elite, who, dressed, in, top, hats, frock, coats, and, business, suits, as, not, authentically, chinese, and, praised, to, puyi, the, confucian, scholars, with, their, traditional, robes, as, the, ones, who, were, authentically, chinese, as, part, of, an, effort, to, crack, down, on, corruption, by, the, eunuchs, inspired, by, johnston, puyi, ordered, an, inventory, of, the, forbidden, city, s, treasures, the, hall, of, established, happiness, was, burned, on, the, night, of, 26, june, 1923, as, the, eunuchs, tried, to, cover, up, the, extent, of, their, theft, johnston, reported, that, the, next, day, he, found, the, emperor, and, empress, standing, on, a, heap, of, charred, wood, sadly, contemplating, the, spectacle, the, treasures, reported, lost, in, the, fire, included, 2, 685, golden, statues, of, buddha, 1, 675, golden, altar, ornaments, 435, porcelain, antiques, and, 31, boxes, of, sable, furs, though, it, is, likely, that, most, if, not, all, of, these, had, been, sold, on, the, black, market, before, the, fire, puyi, finally, decided, to, expel, all, of, the, eunuchs, from, the, forbidden, city, to, end, the, problem, of, theft, only, agreeing, to, keep, 50, after, the, dowager, consorts, complained, that, they, could, not, function, without, them, puyi, turned, the, grounds, where, the, hall, of, supreme, harmony, had, once, stood, into, a, tennis, court, as, he, and, wanrong, loved, to, play, wanrong, s, brother, rong, qi, recalled, but, after, the, eunuchs, went, many, of, the, palaces, inside, the, forbidden, city, were, closed, down, and, the, place, took, on, a, desolate, abandoned, air, after, the, great, kant, earthquake, on, 1, september, 1923, destroyed, the, cities, of, tokyo, and, yokohama, puyi, donated, jade, antiques, worth, some, 33, 000, to, pay, for, disaster, relief, which, led, a, delegation, of, japanese, diplomats, to, visit, the, forbidden, city, to, express, their, thanks, in, their, report, about, the, visit, the, diplomats, noted, that, puyi, was, highly, vain, and, malleable, and, could, be, used, by, japan, which, marked, the, beginning, of, japanese, interest, in, puyi, on, 23, october, 1924, a, coup, led, by, the, warlord, feng, yuxiang, took, control, of, beijing, feng, the, latest, of, the, warlords, to, take, beijing, was, seeking, legitimacy, and, decided, that, abolishing, the, unpopular, articles, of, favourable, settlement, was, an, easy, way, to, win, the, crowd, s, approval, feng, unilaterally, revised, the, articles, of, favourable, treatment, on, 5, november, 1924, abolishing, puyi, s, imperial, title, and, privileges, and, reducing, him, to, a, private, citizen, of, the, republic, of, china, puyi, was, expelled, from, the, forbidden, city, the, same, day, he, was, given, three, hours, to, leave, he, spent, a, few, days, at, the, house, of, his, father, prince, chun, and, then, temporarily, resided, in, the, japanese, embassy, in, beijing, puyi, left, his, father, s, house, together, with, johnston, and, his, chief, servant, big, li, without, informing, prince, chun, s, servants, slipped, his, followers, and, went, to, the, japanese, legation, puyi, had, originally, wanted, to, go, to, the, british, legation, but, johnston, had, insisted, that, he, would, be, safer, with, the, japanese, for, johnston, the, system, where, the, japanese, people, worshipped, their, emperor, as, a, living, god, was, much, closer, to, his, ideal, than, the, british, constitutional, monarchy, and, he, constantly, steered, puyi, in, a, pro, japanese, direction, however, johnston, tried, to, get, the, british, diplomatic, legation, in, beijing, to, host, puyi, and, although, the, british, authorities, were, not, very, interested, in, welcoming, the, former, emperor, the, british, representative, eventually, gave, johnston, his, consent, however, johnston, later, discovered, that, puyi, in, view, of, the, situation, and, that, johnston, was, not, returning, from, his, efforts, had, taken, refuge, in, the, japanese, legation, after, being, advised, by, zheng, xiaoxu, the, japanese, diplomat, kenkichi, yoshizawa, gave, puyi, the, regards, of, the, japanese, government, saying, our, government, has, formally, acknowledged, your, majesty, s, taking, refuge, in, our, legation, and, will, provide, protection, for, you, puyi, s, adviser, lu, zongyu, who, was, secretly, working, for, the, japanese, suggested, that, puyi, move, to, tianjin, which, he, argued, was, safer, than, beijing, though, the, real, reason, was, that, the, japanese, felt, that, puyi, would, be, easier, to, control, in, tianjin, without, the, embarrassment, of, having, him, live, in, the, japanese, legation, which, was, straining, relations, with, china, on, 23, february, 1925, puyi, left, beijing, for, tianjin, wearing, a, simple, chinese, gown, and, skullcap, as, he, was, afraid, of, being, robbed, on, the, train, puyi, described, his, train, journey, to, tianjin, saying, at, every, stop, between, beijing, and, tianjin, several, japanese, policeman, and, special, agents, in, black, suits, would, get, on, the, train, so, that, by, the, time, we, reached, tianjin, my, special, car, was, almost, half, occupied, by, them, in, february, 1925, puyi, moved, to, the, japanese, concession, of, tianjin, first, into, the, zhang, garden, and, in, 1929, into, the, former, residence, of, lu, zongyu, known, as, the, garden, of, serenity, a, british, journalist, henry, woodhead, called, puyi, s, court, a, doggy, paradise, as, both, puyi, and, wanrong, were, dog, lovers, who, owned, several, very, spoiled, dogs, while, puyi, s, courtiers, spent, an, inordinate, amount, of, time, feuding, with, one, another, woodhead, stated, that, the, only, people, who, seemed, to, get, along, at, puyi, s, court, were, wanrong, and, wenxiu, who, were, like, sisters, tianjin, was, after, shanghai, the, most, cosmopolitan, chinese, city, with, large, british, french, german, russian, and, japanese, communities, as, an, emperor, puyi, was, allowed, to, join, several, social, clubs, that, normally, only, admitted, whites, during, this, period, puyi, and, his, advisers, chen, baochen, zheng, xiaoxu, and, luo, zhenyu, discussed, plans, to, restore, puyi, as, emperor, zheng, and, luo, favoured, enlisting, assistance, from, external, parties, while, chen, opposed, the, idea, in, june, 1925, the, warlord, zhang, zuolin, visited, tianjin, to, meet, puyi, old, marshal, zhang, an, illiterate, former, bandit, ruled, manchuria, a, region, equal, in, size, to, germany, and, france, combined, which, had, a, population, of, 30, million, and, was, the, most, industrialised, region, in, china, zhang, kowtowed, to, puyi, at, their, meeting, and, promised, to, restore, the, house, of, qing, if, puyi, made, a, large, financial, donation, to, his, army, zhang, warned, puyi, in, a, roundabout, way, not, to, trust, his, japanese, friends, zhang, fought, in, the, pay, of, the, japanese, but, by, this, time, his, relations, with, the, kwantung, army, were, becoming, strained, in, june, 1927, zhang, captured, beijing, and, behr, observed, that, if, puyi, had, had, more, courage, and, returned, to, beijing, he, might, have, been, restored, to, the, dragon, throne, puyi, was, noted, to, have, said, in, a, 1927, article, in, the, illustrated, london, news, that, i, never, wish, to, be, emperor, again, puyi, s, court, was, prone, to, factionalism, and, his, advisers, were, urging, him, to, back, different, warlords, which, gave, him, a, reputation, for, duplicity, as, he, negotiated, with, various, warlords, which, strained, his, relations, with, marshal, zhang, at, various, times, puyi, met, zhang, zongchang, the, dogmeat, general, and, the, russian, migr, general, grigory, semyonov, at, his, tianjin, house, both, of, them, promised, to, restore, him, to, the, dragon, throne, if, he, gave, them, enough, money, and, both, of, them, kept, all, the, money, he, gave, them, for, themselves, puyi, remembered, zhang, as, a, universally, detested, monster, with, a, face, bloated, and, tinged, with, the, livid, hue, induced, by, opium, smoking, semyonov, in, particular, proved, himself, to, be, a, talented, con, man, claiming, as, an, ataman, to, have, several, cossack, hosts, under, his, command, to, have, 300, million, roubles, in, the, bank, and, to, be, supported, by, american, british, and, japanese, banks, in, his, plans, to, restore, both, the, house, of, qing, in, china, and, the, house, of, romanov, in, russia, puyi, gave, semyonov, a, loan, of, 5, 000, british, pounds, which, semyonov, never, repaid, another, visitor, to, the, garden, of, serenity, was, general, kenji, doihara, a, japanese, army, officer, who, was, fluent, in, mandarin, and, a, man, of, great, charm, who, manipulated, puyi, via, flattery, telling, him, that, a, great, man, such, as, himself, should, go, conquer, manchuria, and, then, just, as, his, qing, ancestors, did, in, the, 17th, century, use, manchuria, as, a, base, for, conquering, china, in, 1928, during, the, northern, expedition, to, reunify, china, troops, sacked, the, qing, tombs, outside, beijing, after, the, kuomintang, and, its, allies, took, beijing, from, zhang, s, army, who, retreated, back, to, manchuria, the, news, that, the, qing, tombs, had, been, plundered, and, the, corpse, of, the, dowager, empress, cixi, had, been, desecrated, greatly, offended, puyi, who, never, forgave, the, kuomintang, and, held, chiang, kai, shek, personally, responsible, the, sacking, also, showed, his, powerlessness, during, his, time, in, tianjin, puyi, was, besieged, with, visitors, asking, him, for, money, including, various, members, of, the, vast, qing, family, old, manchu, bannermen, journalists, prepared, to, write, articles, calling, for, a, qing, restoration, for, the, right, price, and, eunuchs, who, had, once, lived, in, the, forbidden, city, and, were, now, living, in, poverty, puyi, was, often, bored, with, his, life, and, engaged, in, maniacal, shopping, to, compensate, recalling, that, he, was, addicted, to, buying, pianos, watches, clocks, radios, western, clothes, leather, shoes, and, spectacles, puyi, s, first, wife, wanrong, continued, to, smoke, opium, recreationally, during, this, period, their, marriage, began, to, fall, apart, as, they, spent, more, and, more, time, apart, meeting, only, at, mealtimes, puyi, wrote, in, his, memoir, even, if, i, had, had, only, one, wife, she, would, not, have, found, life, with, me, interesting, since, my, preoccupation, was, my, restoration, frankly, i, did, not, know, anything, about, love, in, other, marriages, husband, and, wife, were, equal, but, to, me, wife, and, consort, were, both, the, slaves, and, tools, of, their, master, wanrong, complained, that, her, life, as, an, empress, was, extremely, dull, as, the, rules, for, an, empress, forbade, her, from, going, out, dancing, as, she, wanted, instead, forcing, her, to, spend, her, days, in, traditional, rituals, that, she, found, to, be, meaningless, all, the, more, so, as, china, was, a, republic, and, her, title, of, empress, was, symbolic, only, the, westernised, wanrong, loved, to, go, out, dancing, play, tennis, wear, western, clothes, and, make, up, listen, to, jazz, music, and, to, socialize, with, her, friends, which, the, more, conservative, courtiers, all, objected, to, she, resented, having, to, play, the, traditional, role, of, a, chinese, empress, but, was, unwilling, to, break, with, puyi, puyi, s, butler, was, secretly, a, japanese, spy, and, in, a, report, to, his, masters, he, described, puyi, and, wanrong, one, day, spending, hours, screaming, at, one, another, in, the, gardens, with, wanrong, repeatedly, calling, puyi, a, eunuch, whether, she, meant, that, as, a, reference, to, sexual, inadequacy, is, unclear, puyi, s, sister, yunhe, noted, in, her, diary, in, september, 1930, that, puyi, had, told, her, that, yesterday, the, empress, flew, into, rage, saying, that, she, had, been, bullied, by, me, and, she, poured, out, terrible, and, absurd, words, in, 1931, puyi, s, concubine, wenxiu, declared, that, she, had, had, enough, of, him, and, his, court, and, simply, walked, out, filing, for, divorce, in, september, 1931, puyi, sent, a, letter, to, jir, minami, the, japanese, minister, of, war, expressing, his, desire, to, be, restored, to, the, throne, on, the, night, of, 18, september, 1931, the, mukden, incident, began, when, the, japanese, kwantung, army, blew, up, a, section, of, railroad, belonging, to, the, japanese, owned, south, manchurian, railroad, company, and, blamed, the, warlord, marshal, zhang, xueliang, on, this, pretext, the, kwantung, army, began, a, general, offensive, with, the, aim, of, conquering, all, of, manchuria, puyi, was, visited, by, kenji, doihara, head, of, the, espionage, office, of, the, japanese, kwantung, army, who, proposed, establishing, puyi, as, head, of, a, manchurian, state, the, japanese, further, bribed, a, caf, worker, to, tell, puyi, that, a, contract, was, out, on, his, life, in, an, attempt, to, frighten, puyi, into, moving, the, empress, wanrong, was, firmly, against, puyi, s, plans, to, go, to, manchuria, which, she, called, treason, and, for, a, moment, puyi, hesitated, leading, doihara, to, send, for, puyi, s, cousin, the, very, pro, japanese, yoshiko, kawashima, also, known, as, eastern, jewel, dongzhen, to, visit, him, to, change, his, mind, yoshiko, a, strong, willed, flamboyant, openly, bisexual, woman, noted, for, her, habit, of, wearing, male, clothing, and, uniforms, had, much, influence, on, puyi, in, the, tientsin, incident, of, november, 1931, puyi, and, zheng, xiaoxu, travelled, to, manchuria, to, complete, plans, for, the, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, puyi, left, his, house, in, tianjin, by, hiding, in, the, trunk, of, a, car, the, chinese, government, ordered, his, arrest, for, treason, but, was, unable, to, breach, the, japanese, protection, puyi, boarded, a, japanese, ship, that, took, him, across, the, bohai, and, when, he, landed, in, port, arthur, modern, l, shun, he, was, greeted, by, the, man, who, was, to, become, his, minder, general, masahiko, amakasu, who, took, them, to, a, resort, owned, by, the, south, manchurian, railroad, company, amakasu, was, a, fearsome, man, who, told, puyi, how, in, the, amakasu, incident, of, 1923, he, had, the, feminist, noe, it, her, lover, the, anarchist, sakae, sugi, and, a, six, year, old, boy, strangled, as, they, were, enemies, of, the, emperor, and, he, likewise, would, kill, puyi, if, he, should, prove, to, be, an, enemy, of, the, emperor, chen, baochen, returned, to, beijing, where, he, died, in, 1935, once, he, arrived, in, manchuria, puyi, discovered, that, he, was, a, prisoner, and, was, not, allowed, outside, the, yamato, hotel, ostensibly, to, protect, him, from, assassination, wanrong, had, stayed, in, tianjin, and, remained, opposed, to, puyi, s, decision, to, work, with, the, japanese, requiring, her, friend, eastern, jewel, to, visit, numerous, times, to, convince, her, to, go, to, manchuria, behr, commented, that, if, wanrong, had, been, a, stronger, woman, she, might, have, remained, in, tianjin, and, filed, for, divorce, but, ultimately, she, accepted, eastern, jewel, s, argument, that, it, was, her, duty, as, a, wife, to, follow, her, husband, and, six, weeks, after, the, tientsin, incident, she, too, crossed, the, east, china, sea, to, port, arthur, with, eastern, jewel, to, keep, her, company, in, early, 1932, general, seishir, itagaki, informed, puyi, that, the, new, state, was, to, be, a, republic, with, him, as, chief, executive, the, capital, was, to, be, changchun, his, form, of, address, was, to, be, your, excellency, not, your, imperial, majesty, and, there, were, to, be, no, references, to, puyi, ruling, with, the, mandate, of, heaven, all, of, which, displeased, puyi, the, suggestion, that, manchukuo, was, to, be, based, on, popular, sovereignty, with, the, 34, million, people, of, manchuria, asking, that, puyi, rule, over, them, was, completely, contrary, to, puyi, s, ideas, about, his, right, to, rule, by, the, mandate, of, heaven, itagaki, suggested, to, puyi, that, in, a, few, years, manchukuo, might, become, a, monarchy, and, that, manchuria, was, just, the, beginning, as, japan, had, ambitions, to, take, all, of, china, the, obvious, implication, was, that, puyi, would, become, the, great, qing, emperor, again, when, puyi, objected, to, itagaki, s, plans, he, was, told, that, he, was, in, no, position, to, negotiate, as, itagaki, had, no, interest, in, his, opinions, on, these, issues, unlike, doihara, who, was, always, very, polite, and, constantly, stroked, puyi, s, ego, itagaki, was, brutally, rude, and, brusque, barking, out, orders, as, if, to, a, particularly, dim, witted, common, soldier, itagaki, had, promised, puyi, s, chief, advisor, zheng, xiaoxu, that, he, would, be, the, manchukuo, prime, minister, an, offer, that, appealed, to, his, vanity, enough, that, he, persuaded, puyi, to, accept, the, japanese, terms, telling, him, that, manchukuo, would, soon, become, a, monarchy, and, history, would, repeat, itself, as, puyi, would, conquer, the, rest, of, china, from, his, manchurian, base, just, as, the, qing, did, in, 1644, in, japanese, propaganda, puyi, was, always, celebrated, both, in, traditionalist, terms, as, a, confucian, sage, king, out, to,

asianism, with, the, five, races, of, japanese, chinese, koreans, manchus, and, mongols, coming, together, which, marked, nothing, less, than, the, birth, of, a, new, civilization, and, a, turning, point, in, world, history, a, press, statement, issued, on, 1, march, 1932, stated, the, glorious, advent, of, manchukuo, with, the, eyes, of, the, world, turned, on, it, was, an, epochal, event, of, far, reaching, consequence, in, world, history, marking, the, birth, of, a, new, era, in, government, racial, relations, and, other, affairs, of, general, interest, never, in, the, chronicles, of, the, human, race, was, any, state, born, with, such, high, ideals, and, never, has, any, state, accomplished, so, much, in, such, a, brief, space, of, its, existence, as, manchukuo, on, 8, march,

me, puyi, s, friend, the, british, journalist, woodhead, wrote, outside, official, circles, i, met, no, chinese, who, felt, any, enthusiasm, for, the, new, regime, and, that, the, city, of, harbin,

desperately, wanted, to, ask, him, for, political, asylum, in, britain, but, as, general, itagaki, was, sitting, right, next, to, him, at, the, meeting, he, told, lytton, that, the, masses, of, the, people, had, begged, me, to, come, that, my, stay, here, was, absolutely, voluntary, and, free, after, the, interview, itagaki, told, puyi, your, excellency, s, manner, was, perfect, you, spoke, beautifully, the, diplomat, wellington, koo, who, was, attached, to, the, commission, as, its, chinese, assessor, received, a, secret, message, saying, a, representative, of, the, imperial, household,

help, her, escape, from, changchun, he, said, she, found, life, miserable, there, because, she, was, surrounded, in, her, house, by, japanese, maids, every, movement, of, hers, was, watched, and, reported, koo, said, he, was, touched, but, could, do, nothing, to, help, wanrong, escape, which, her, brother, rong, qi, said, was, the, final, blow, to, her, leading, her, into, a, downward, spiral, right, from, the, start, the, japanese, occupation, had, sparked, much, resistance, by, guerrillas, whom, the, kwantung, army, called, bandits, general, doihara, was, able, in, exchange, for, a, multi, million, bribe, to, get, one, of, the, more, prominent, guerrilla, leaders, the, hui, muslim, general, ma, zhanshan, to, accept, japanese, rule, and, had, puyi, appoint, him, defence, minister, much, to, the, intense, chagrin, of, puyi, and, his, japanese, masters, ma, s, defection, turned, to, be, a, ruse, and, only, months, after, puyi, appointed, him, defence, minister, ma, took, his, troops, over, the, border, to, the, soviet, union, to, continue, the, struggle, against, the, japanese, emperor, hirohito, wanted, to, see, if, puyi, was, reliable, before, giving, him, an, imperial, title, and, it, was, not, until, october, 1933, that, general, doihara, told, him, he, was, to, be, an, emperor, again, causing, puyi, to, go, in, his, own, words, wild, with, joy, though, he, was, disappointed, that, he, was, not, given, back, his, old, title, of, great, qing, emperor, at, the, same, time, doihara, informed, puyi, that, the, emperor, is, your, father, and, is, represented, in, manchukuo, as, the, kwantung, army, which, must, be, obeyed, like, a, father, right, from, the, start, manchukuo, was, infamous, for, its, high, crime, rate, as, japanese, sponsored, gangs, of,

police, intelligence, agencies, operating, in, manchukuo, who, were, all, told, by, tokyo, that, japan, was, a, poor, country, and, that, they, were, to, pay, for, their, own, operations, by, engaging, in, organised, crime, the, italian, adventurer, amleto, vespa, remembered, that, general, kenji, doihara, told, him, manchuria, was, going, to, have, to, pay, for, its, own, exploitation, in, 1933, simon, kasp, a, french, jewish, pianist, visiting, his, father, in, manchukuo, who, owned, a, hotel, in, harbin, was, kidnapped, tortured, and, murdered, by, an, anti, semitic, gang, from, the, russian, fascists, the, kasp, case, became, an, international, cause, c, l, bre, attracting, much, media, attention, around, the, world, ultimately, leading, to, two, trials, in, harbin, in, 1935, and, 1936, as, the, evidence, that, the, russian, fascist, gang, who, had, killed, kasp, was, working, for, the, kenpeitai, the, military, police, of, the, imperial, japanese, army, had, become, too, strong, for, even, tokyo, to, ignore, puyi, was, portrayed, as, having, with, a, little, help, from, the, kwantung, army, saved, the, people, from, the, chaos, of, rule, by, the, zhang, family, manchukuo, s, high, crime, rate, and, the, much, publicised, kasp, case, made, a, mockery, of, the, claim, that, puyi, had, saved, the, people, of, manchuria, from, a, lawless, and, violent, regime,

prevent, him, from, going, off, script, wanrong, was, excluded, from, the, coronation, her, addiction, to, opium, anti, japanese, feelings, dislike, of, puyi, and, growing, reputation, for, being, difficult, and, unpredictable, led, amakasu, to, the, conclusion, that, she, could, not, be, trusted, to, behave, though, submissive, in, public, to, the, japanese, puyi, was, constantly, at, odds, with, them, in, private, he, resented, being, head, of, state, and, then, emperor, of, manchukuo, rather, than, being, fully, restored, as, a, qing, emperor, at, his, enthronement, he, clashed, with, japan, over, dress, they, wanted, him, to, wear, a, military, uniform, like, those, used, by, the, manchukuo, military, whereas, he, considered, it, an, insult, to, wear, anything, but, traditional, manchu, robes, in, a, typical, compromise, he, wore, a, western, military, uniform, to, his, enthronement, the, only, chinese, emperor, ever, to, do, so, and, a, dragon, robe, to, the, announcement, of, his, accession, at, the, temple, of, heaven, puyi, was, driven, to, his, coronation, in, a, lincoln, limousine, with, bulletproof, windows, followed, by, nine, packards, and, during, his,

shenyang, which, had, been, the, qing, capital, before, the, conquest, of, the, ming, in, 1644, but, was, overruled, by, his, japanese, masters, puyi, hated, xinjing, which, he, regarded, as, an, undistinguished, industrial, city, that, lacked, the, historical, connections, with, the, qing, that, mukden, had, as, there, was, no, palace, in, changchun, puyi, moved, into, what, had, once, been, the, office, of, the, salt, tax, administration, during, the, russian, period, and, as, result, the, building, was, known, as, salt, tax, palace, which, is, now, the, museum, of, the, imperial, palace, of, manchukuo, puyi, lived, there, as, a, virtual, prisoner, and, could, not, leave, without, permission, shortly, after, puyi, s, coronation, his, father, arrived, at, the, xinjing, railroad, station, for, a, visit, prince, chun, told, his, son, that, he, was, an, idiot, if, he, really, believed, that, the, japanese, were, going, to, restore, him, to, the, dragon, throne, and, warned, him, that, he, was, just, being, used, the, japanese, embassy, issued, a, note, of, diplomatic, protest, at, the, welcome, extended, to, prince, chun, stating, that, the, xinjing, railroad, station, was, under, the, kwantung, army, s, control, that, only, japanese, soldiers, were, allowed, there, and, that, they, would, not, tolerate, the, manchukuo, imperial, guard, being, used, to, welcome, visitors, at, the, xinjing, railroad, station, again, in, this, period, puyi, frequently, visited, the, provinces, of, manchukuo, to, open, factories, and, mines, took, part, in, the, birthday, celebrations, for, hirohito, at, kwantung, army, headquarters, and, on, the, japanese, holiday, of, memorial, day, formally, paid, his, respects, with, japanese, rituals, to, the, souls, of, the,

in, manchukuo, at, the, beginning, of, every, school, day, kowtowed, first, in, the, direction, of, tokyo, and, then, to, a, portrait, of, puyi, in, the, classroom, puyi, found, this, intoxicating, he, visited, a, coal, mine, and, in, his, rudimentary, japanese, thanked, the, japanese, foreman, for, his, good, work, who, burst, into, tears, as, he, thanked, the, emperor, puyi, later, wrote, that, the, treatment, i, received, really, went, to, my, head, whenever, the, japanese, wanted, a, law, passed, the, relevant, decree, was, dropped, off, at, salt, tax, palace, for, puyi, to, sign, which, he, always, did, puyi, signed, decrees, expropriating, vast, tracts, of, farmland, to, japanese, colonists, and, a, law, declaring, certain, thoughts, to, be, thought, crimes, leading, behr, to, note, in, theory, as, supreme, commander, he, thus, bore, full, responsibility, for, japanese, atrocities, committed, in, his, name, on, anti, japanese, bandits, and, patriotic, chinese, citizens, behr, further, noted, the, empire, of, manchukuo, billed, as, an, idealistic, state, where, the, five, races, of, the, chinese, japanese, koreans, manchus, and, mongols, had, come, together, in, pan, asian, brotherhood, was, in, fact, one, of, the, most, brutally, run, countries, in, the, world, a, textbook, example, of, colonialism, albeit, of, the, oriental, kind, manchukuo, was, a, sham, and, was, a, japanese, colony, run, entirely, for, japan, s, benefit, american, historian, carter, j, eckert, wrote, that, the, differences, in, power, could, be, seen, in, that, the, kwantung, army, had, a, massive, headquarters, in, downtown, xinjing, while, puyi, had, to, live, in, the, small, and, shabby, salt, tax, palace, close, to, the, main, railroad, station, in, a, part, of, xinjing, with, numerous, small, factories, warehouses, and, slaughterhouses, the, chief, prison, and, the, red, light, district, behr, commented, that, puyi, knew, from, his, talks, in, tianjin, with, general, kenji, doihara, and, general, seishir, itagaki, that, he, was, dealing, with, ruthless, men, and, that, this, might, be, the, regime, to, expect, puyi, later, recalled, that, i, had, put, my, head, in, the, tiger, s, mouth, by, going, to, manchuria, in, 1931, from, 1935, to, 1945, kwantung, army, senior, staff, officer, yoshioka, yasunori, was, assigned, to, puyi, as, attach, to, the, imperial, household, in, manchukuo, he, acted, as, a, spy, for, the, japanese, government, controlling, puyi, through, fear, intimidation, and, direct, orders, there, were, many, attempts, on, puyi, s, life, during, this, period, including, a, 1937, stabbing, by, a, palace, servant, in, 1935, puyi, visited, japan, the, second, secretary, of, the, japanese, embassy, in, xinjing, kenjiro, hayashide, served, as, puyi, s, interpreter, during, this, trip, and, later, wrote, what, behr, called, a, very, absurd, book, the, epochal, journey, to, japan, chronicling, this, visit, where, he, managed, to, present, every, banal, statement, made, by, puyi, as, profound, wisdom, and, claimed, that, he, wrote, an, average, of, two, poems, per, day, on, his, trip, to, japan, despite, being, busy, with, attending, all, sorts, of, official, functions, hayashide, had, also, written, a, booklet, promoting, the, trip, in, japan, which, claimed, that, puyi, was, a, great, reader, who, was, hardly, ever, seen, without, a, book, in, his, hand, a, skilled, calligrapher, a, talented, painter, and, an, excellent, horseman, and, archer, able, to, shoot, arrows, while, riding, just, like, his, qing, ancestors, hirohito, took, this, claim, that, puyi, was, a, hippophile, seriously, and, presented, him, with, a, gift, of, a, horse, for, him, to, review, the, imperial, japanese, army, with, in, fact, puyi, was, a, hippophobe, who, adamantly, refused, to, get, on, the, horse, forcing, the, japanese, to, hurriedly, bring, out, a, carriage, for, the, two, emperors, to, review, the, troops, after, his, return, to, xinjing, puyi, hired, an, american, public, relations, executive, george, bronson, rea, to, lobby, the, u, s, government, to, recognize, manchukuo, in, late, 1935, rea, published, a, book, the, case, for, manchukuo, in, which, rea, castigated, china, under, the, kuomintang, as, hopelessly, corrupt, and, praised, puyi, s, wise, leadership, of, manchukuo, writing, manchukuo, was, the, one, step, that, the, people, of, the, east, have, taken, towards, escape, from, the, misery, and, misgovernment, that, have, become, theirs, japan, s, protection, is, its, only, chance, of, happiness, rea, continued, to, work, for, puyi, until, the, bombing, of, pearl, harbor, but, he, ultimately, failed, in, lobbying, washington, to, recognize, xinjing, at, the, second, trial, relating, to, the, long, running, kasp, case, in, harbin, in, march, june, 1936, the, japanese, prosecutor, argued, in, favour, of, the, six, defendants, calling, them, russian, patriots, who, raised, the, flag, against, a, world, danger, communism, much, to, everyone, s, surprise, the, chinese, judges, convicted, and, sentenced, the, six, russian, fascists, who, had, tortured, and, killed, kasp, to, death, which, led, to, a, storm, as, the, russian, fascist, party, called, the, six, men, martyrs, for, holy, russia, and, presented, to, puyi, a, petition, with, thousands, of, signatures, asking, him, to, pardon, the, six, men, puyi, refused, to, pardon, the, russian, fascists, but, the, verdict, was, appealed, to, the, xinjing, supreme, court, where, the, japanese, judges, quashed, the, verdict, ordering, the, six, men, to, be, freed, a, decision, that, puyi, accepted, without, complaint, the, handling, of, the, kasp, case, which, attracted, much, attention, in, the, western, media, did, much, to, tarnish, the, image, of, manchukuo, and, further, weakened, puyi, s, already, weak, hand, as, he, sought, to, have, the, rest, of, the, world, recognize, manchukuo, in, 1936, ling, sheng, an, aristocrat, who, was, serving, as, governor, of, one, of, manchukuo, s, provinces, and, whose, son, was, engaged, to, marry, one, of, puyi, s, younger, sisters, was, arrested, after, complaining, about, intolerable, japanese, interference, in, his, work, which, led, puyi, to, ask, yoshioka, if, something, could, be, done, to, help, him, out, the, kwantung, army, s, commander, general, kenkichi, ueda, visited, puyi, to, tell, him, the, matter, was, resolved, as, ling, had, already, been, convicted, by, a, japanese, court, martial, of, plotting, rebellion, and, had, been, executed, by, beheading, which, led, puyi, to, cancel, the, marriage, between, his, sister, and, ling, s, son, during, these, years, puyi, began, taking, a, greater, interest, in, traditional, chinese, law, and, religion, such, as, confucianism, and, buddhism, but, this, was, disallowed, by, the, japanese, gradually, his, old, supporters, were, eliminated, and, pro, japanese, ministers, put, in, their, place, during, this, period, puyi, s, life, consisted, mostly, of, signing, laws, prepared, by, japan, reciting, prayers, consulting, oracles, and, making, formal, visits, throughout, his, state, puyi, was, extremely, unhappy, with, his, life, as, a, virtual, prisoner, in, the, salt, tax, palace, and, his, moods, became, erratic, swinging, from, hours, of, passivity, staring, into, space, to, indulging, his, sadism, by, having, his, servants, beaten, puyi, later, wrote, that, his, orphaned, page, boy, servants, most, of, whom, had, had, their, parents, killed, by, the, japanese, experienced, such, wretched, lives, in, the, palace, they, were, the, size, of, 10, year, olds, at, the, age, of, eighteen, puyi, was, obsessed, by, the, fact, that, the, vast, majority, of, puyi, s, loving, subjects, hated, him, and, as, behr, observed, it, was, the, knowledge, that, he, was, an, object, of, hatred, and, derision, that, drove, puyi, to, the, brink, of, madness, puyi, always, had, a, strong, cruel, streak, and, he, imposed, harsh, house, rules, on, his, staff, servants, were, flogged, in, the, basement, for, such, offences, as, irresponsible, conversations, the, phrase, take, him, downstairs, was, much, feared, by, puyi, s, servants, as, he, had, at, least, one, flogging, performed, a, day, and, everyone, in, the, salt, tax, palace, was, caned, at, one, point, or, another, except, the, empress, and, puyi, s, siblings, and, their, spouses, puyi, s, experience, of, widespread, theft, during, his, time, in, the, forbidden, city, led, him, to, distrust, his, servants, and, he, obsessively, went, over, the, account, books, for, signs, of, fraud, to, further, torment, his, staff, of, about, 100, puyi, drastically, cut, back, on, the, food, allocated, for, his, staff, who, suffered, from, hunger, big, li, told, behr, that, puyi, was, attempting, to, make, everyone, as, miserable, as, he, was, besides, tormenting, his, staff, puyi, s, life, as, emperor, was, one, of, lethargy, and, passivity, which, his, ghostwriter, li, wenda, called, a, kind, of, living, death, for, him, puyi, became, a, devoted, buddhist, a, mystic, and, a, vegetarian, having, statues, of, the, buddha, put, up, all, over, the, salt, tax, palace, for, him, to, pray, to, while, banning, his, staff, from, eating, meat, his, buddhism, led, him, to, ban, his, staff, from, killing, insects, or, mice, but, if, he, found, any, insects, in, his, food, the, cooks, were, flogged, one, day, when, out, for, a, stroll, in, the, gardens, puyi, found, that, a, servant, had, written, in, chalk, on, one, of, the, rocks, haven, t, the, japanese, humiliated, you, enough, when, puyi, received, guests, at, the, salt, tax, palace, he, gave, them, long, lectures, on, the, glorious, history, of, the, qing, as, a, form, of, masochism, comparing, the, great, qing, emperors, with, himself, a, miserable, man, living, as, a, prisoner, in, his, own, palace, wanrong, who, detested, her, husband, liked, to, mock, him, behind, his, back, by, performing, skits, before, the, servants, by, putting, on, dark, glasses, and, imitating, puyi, s, jerky, movements, during, his, time, in, tianjin, puyi, had, started, wearing, dark, glasses, at, all, times, during, the, interwar, period, dark, glasses, were, worn, by, tianjin, s, homosexual, tiny, minority, to, signify, their, orientation, although, puyi, likely, knew, this, surviving, members, of, his, court, said, that, he, really, was, subject, to, eye, strain, and, headaches, from, the, sun, s, glare, on, 3, april, 1937, puyi, s, younger, full, brother, prince, pujie, was, proclaimed, heir, apparent, after, marrying, lady, hiro, saga, a, distant, cousin, of, hirohito, the, kwantung, army, general, shigeru, honj, had, politically, arranged,

japanese, spy, but, came, to, trust, her, after, the, sinophile, saga, discarded, her, kimono, for, cheongsams, and, repeatedly, assured, him, that, she, came, to, the, salt, tax, palace, because, she, was, pujie, s, wife, not, as, a, spy, behr, described, lady, saga, as, intelligent, and, level, headed, and, noted, the, irony, of, puyi, snubbing, the, one, japanese, who, really, wanted, to,

his, homosexual, advances, puyi, ordered, that, he, be, given, an, especially, harsh, flogging, which, caused, the, boy, s, death, and, led, puyi, to, have, the, floggers, flogged, in, turn, as, punishment, in, july, 1937, when, the, second, sino, japanese, war, began, puyi, issued, a, declaration, of, support, for, japan, in, august, 1937, kishi, wrote, up, a, decree, for, puyi, to, sign, calling, for, the, use, of, corv, e, labour, to, be, conscripted, both, in, manchukuo, and, in, northern, china, stating, that, in, these, times, of, emergency, i, e, war, with, china, industry, needed, to, grow, at, all, costs, and, slavery, was, necessary, to, save, money, driscoll, wrote, that, just, as, african, slaves, were, taken, to, the, new, world, on, the, middle, passage, it, would, be, right, to, speak, of, the, manchurian, passage, as, vast, numbers, of, chinese, peasants, were, rounded, up, to, be, slaves, in, manchukuo, s, factories, and, mines, from, 1938, until, the, end, of, the, war, every, year, about, a, million, chinese, were, taken, from, the, manchukuo, countryside, and, northern, china, to, be, slaves, in, manchukuo, s, factories, and, mines, all, that, puyi, knew, of, the, outside, world, was, what, general, yoshioka, told, him, in, daily, briefings, when, behr, asked, prince, pujie, how, the, news, of, the, nanjing, massacre, in, december, 1937, affected, puyi, his, brother, replied, we, didn, t, hear, about, it, until, much, later, at, the, time, it, made, no, real, impact, on, 4, february, 1938, the, strongly, pro, japanese, and, anti, chinese, joachim, von, ribbentrop, became, the, german, foreign, minister, and, under, his, influence, german, foreign, policy, swung, in, an, anti, chinese, and, pro, japanese, direction, on, 20, february, 1938, adolf, hitler, announced, that, germany, was, recognizing, manchukuo, in, one, of, his, last, acts, the, outgoing, german, ambassador, to, japan, herbert, von, dirksen, visited, puyi, in, the, salt, tax, palace, to, tell, him, that, a, german, embassy, would, be, established, in, xinjing, later, that, year, to, join, the, embassies, of, japan, el, salvador, the, dominican, republic, costa, rica, italy, and, nationalist, spain, the, only, other, countries, that, had, recognised, manchukuo, in, 1934, puyi, had, been, excited, when, he, learned, that, el, salvador, had, become, the, first, nation, other, than, japan, to, recognize, manchukuo, but, by, 1938, he, did, not, care, much, about, germany, s, recognition, of, manchukuo, in, may, 1938, puyi, was, declared, a, god, by, the, religions, law, and, a, cult, of, emperor, worship, very, similar, to, japan, s, began, with, schoolchildren, starting, their, classes, by, praying, to, a, portrait, of, the, god, emperor, while, imperial, rescripts, and, the, imperial, regalia, became, sacred, relics, imbued, with, magical, powers, by, being, associated, with, the, god, emperor, puyi, s, elevation, to, a, god, was, due, to, the, sino, japanese, war, which, caused, the, japanese, state, to, begin, a, program, of, totalitarian, mobilization, of, society, for, total, war, in, japan, and, places, ruled, by, japan, his, japanese, handlers, felt, that, ordinary, people, in, japan, korea, and, taiwan, were, more, willing, to, bear, the, sacrifices, for, total, war, because, of, their, devotion, to, their, god, emperor, and, it, was, decided, that, making, puyi, a, god, emperor, would, have, the, same, effect, in, manchukuo, after, 1938, puyi, was, hardly, ever, allowed, to, leave, the, salt, tax, palace, while, the, creation, of, the, puppet, regime, of, president, wang, jingwei, in, november, 1938, crushed, puyi, s, spirits, as, it, ended, his, hope, of, one, day, being, restored, as, the, great, qing, emperor, puyi, became, a, hypochondriac, taking, all, sorts, of, pills, for, various, imagined, ailments, and, hormones, to, improve, his, sex, drive, and, allow, him, to, father, a, boy, as, puyi, was, convinced, that, the, japanese, were, poisoning, his, food, to, make, him, sterile, he, believed, the, japanese, wanted, one, of, the, children, pujie, had, fathered, with, lady, saga, to, be, the, next, emperor, and, it, was, a, great, relief, to, him, that, their, children, were, both, girls, in, 1935, wanrong, engaged, in, an, affair, with, puyi, s, chauffeur, li, tiyu, that, left, her, pregnant, to, punish, her, wanrong, s, baby, was, killed, it, is, unclear, what, happened, but, there, are, two, accounts, of, what, happened, to, wanrong, after, her, baby, s, murder, one, account, said, that, puyi, lied, to, wanrong, and, that, her, daughter, was, being, raised, by, a, nanny, and, she, never, knew, about, her, daughter, s, death, the, other, account, said, that, wanrong, had, found, out, or, knew, about, her, daughter, s, infanticide, and, lived, in, a, constant, daze, of, opium, consumption, thereafter, puyi, had, known, of, what, was, being, planned, for, wanrong, s, baby, and, in, what, behr, called, a, supreme, act, of, cowardice, on, his, part, did, nothing, puyi, s, ghostwriter, for, emperor, to, citizen, li, wenda, told, behr, that, when, interviewing, puyi, for, the, book, that, he, could, not, get, puyi, to, talk, about, the, killing, of, wanrong, s, child, as, he, was, too, ashamed, to, speak, of, his, own, cowardice, in, december, 1941, puyi, followed, japan, in, declaring, war, on, the, united, states, and, great, britain, but, as, neither, nation, had, recognised, manchukuo, there, were, no, reciprocal, declarations, of, war, in, return, during, the, war, puyi, was, an, example, and, role, model, for, at, least, some, in, asia, who, believed, in, the, japanese, pan, asian, propaganda, u, saw, the, prime, minister, of, burma, was, secretly, in, communication, with, the, japanese, declaring, that, as, an, asian, his, sympathies, were, completely, with, japan, against, the, west, u, saw, further, added, that, he, hoped, that, when, japan, won, the, war, that, he, would, enjoy, exactly, the, same, status, in, burma, that, puyi, enjoyed, in, manchukuo, as, part, of, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, during, the, war, puyi, became, estranged, from, his, father, as, his, half, brother, pu, ren, stated, in, an, interview, after, 1941, puyi, s, father, had, written, him, off, he, never, visited, puyi, after, 1934, they, rarely, corresponded, all, the, news, he, got, was, through, intermediaries, or, occasional, reports, from, puyi, s, younger, sisters, some, of, whom, were, allowed, to, see, him, puyi, complained, that, he, had, issued, so, many, slavish, pro, japanese, statements, during, the, war, that, nobody, on, the, allied, side, would, take, him, in, if, he, did, escape, from, manchukuo, in, june, 1942, puyi, made, a, rare, visit, outside, the, salt, tax, palace, when, he, conferred, with, the, graduating, class, at, the, manchukuo, military, academy, and, awarded, the, star, student, takagi, masao, a, gold, watch, for, his, outstanding, performance, despite, his, japanese, name, the, star, student, was, actually, korean, and, under, his, original, korean, name, of, park, chung, hee, became, the, dictator, of, south, korea, in, 1961, in, august, 1942, puyi, s, concubine, tan, yuling, fell, ill, and, died, after, being, treated, by, the, same, japanese, doctors, who, murdered, wanrong, s, baby, puyi, testified, at, the, tokyo, war, crimes, trial, of, his, belief, that, she, was, murdered, puyi, kept, a, lock, of, tan, s, hair, and, her, nail, clippings, for, the, rest, of, his, life, as, he, expressed, much, sadness, over, her, loss, he, refused, to, take, a, japanese, concubine, to, replace, tan, and, in, 1943, took, a, chinese, concubine, li, yuqin, the, 16, year, old, daughter, of, a, waiter, puyi, liked, li, but, his, main, interest, continued, to, be, his, pageboys, as, he, later, wrote, these, actions, of, mine, go, to, show, how, cruel, mad, violent, and, unstable, i, was, for, much, of, world, war, ii, puyi, confined, to, the, salt, tax, palace, believed, that, japan, was, winning, the, war, and, it, was, not, until, 1944, that, he, started, to, doubt, this, after, the, japanese, press, began, to, report, heroic, sacrifices, in, burma, and, on, pacific, islands, while, air, raid, shelters, started, to, be, built, in, manchukuo, puyi, s, nephew, jui, lon, told, behr, he, desperately, wanted, america, to, win, the, war, big, li, said, when, he, thought, it, was, safe, he, would, sit, at, the, piano, and, do, a, one, finger, version, of, the, stars, and, stripes, in, mid, 1944, puyi, finally, acquired, the, courage, to, start, occasionally, tuning, in, his, radio, to, chinese, broadcasts, and, to, chinese, language, broadcasts, by, the, americans, where, he, was, shocked, to, learn, that, japan, had, suffered, so, many, defeats, since, 1942, puyi, had, to, give, a, speech, before, a, group, of, japanese, infantrymen, who, had, volunteered, to, be, human, bullets, promising, to, strap, explosives, on, their, bodies, and, to, stage, suicide, attacks, to, die, for, hirohito, puyi, commented, as, he, read, out, his, speech, praising, the, glories, of, dying, for, the, emperor, only, then, did, i, see, the, ashen, grey, of, their, faces, and, the, tears, flowing, down, their, cheeks, and, hear, their, sobbing, puyi, commented, that, he, felt, at, that, moment, utterly, terrified, at, the, death, cult, fanaticism, of, bushido, which, reduced, the, value, of, human, life, down, to, nothing, as, to, die, for, the, emperor, was, the, only, thing, that, mattered, on, 9, august, 1945, the, kwantung, army, s, commander, general, otoz, yamada, told, puyi, that, the, soviet, union, had, declared, war, on, japan, and, the, red, army, had, entered, manchukuo, yamada, was, assuring, puyi, that, the, kwantung, army, would, easily, defeat, the, red, army, when, the, air, raid, sirens, sounded, and, the, red, air, force, began, a, bombing, raid, forcing, all, to, hide, in, the, basement, while, puyi, prayed, to, the, buddha, yamada, fell, silent, as, the, bombs, fell, destroying, japanese, barracks, next, to, the, salt, tax, palace, in, the, manchurian, strategic, offensive, operation, 1, 577, 725, soviet, and, mongol, troops, stormed, into, manchuria, in, a, combined, arms, offensive, with, tanks, artillery, cavalry, aircraft, and, infantry, working, closely, together, that, overwhelmed, the, kwantung, army, who, had, not, expected, a, soviet, invasion, until, 1946, and, were, short, of, both, tanks, and, anti, tank, guns, puyi, was, terrified, to, hear, that, the, mongolian, people, s, army, had, joined, operation, august, storm, as, he, believed, that, the, mongols, would, torture, him, to, death, if, they, captured, him, the, next, day, yamada, told, puyi, that, the, soviets, had, already, broken, through, the, defence, lines, in, northern, manchukuo, but, the, kwantung, army, would, hold, the, line, in, southern, manchukuo, and, puyi, must, leave, at, once, the, staff, of, the, salt, tax, palace, were, thrown, into, panic, as, puyi, ordered, all, of, his, treasures, to, be, boxed, up, and, shipped, out, in, the, meantime, puyi, observed, from, his, window, that, soldiers, of, the, manchukuo, imperial, army, were, taking, off, their, uniforms, and, deserting, to, test, the, reaction, of, his, japanese, masters, puyi, put, on, his, uniform, of, commander, in, chief, of, the, manchukuo, army, and, announced, we, must, support, the, holy, war, of, our, parental, country, with, all, our, strength, and, must, resist, the, soviet, armies, to, the, end, to, the, very, end, with, that, yoshioka, fled, the, room, which, showed, puyi, that, the, war, was, lost, at, one, point, a, group, of, japanese, soldiers, arrived, at, the, salt, tax, palace, and, puyi, believed, they, had, come, to, kill, him, but, they, merely, went, away, after, seeing, him, stand, at, the, top, of, the, staircase, most, of, the, staff, at, the, salt, tax, palace, had, already, fled, and, puyi, found, that, his, phone, calls, to, the, kwantung, army, hq, went, unanswered, as, most, of, the, officers, had, already, left, for, korea, his, minder, amakasu, killed, himself, by, swallowing, a, cyanide, pill, and, the, people, of, changchun, booed, him, when, his, car, flying, imperial, standards, took, him, to, the, railroad, station, late, on, the, night, of, 11, august, 1945, a, train, carrying, puyi, his, court, his, ministers, and, the, qing, treasures, left, changchun, puyi, saw, thousands, of, panic, stricken, japanese, settlers, fleeing, south, in, vast, columns, across, the, roads, of, the, countryside, at, every, railroad, station, hundreds, of, japanese, colonists, attempted, to, board, his, train, puyi, remembered, them, weeping, and, begging, japanese, gendarmes, to, let, them, pass, and, at, several, stations, japanese, soldiers, and, gendarmes, fought, one, another, general, yamada, boarded, the, train, as, it, meandered, south, and, told, puyi, the, japanese, army, was, winning, and, had, destroyed, large, numbers, of, tanks, and, aircraft, a, claim, that, nobody, aboard, the, train, believed, on, 15, august, 1945, puyi, heard, on, the, radio, the, address, of, hirohito, announcing, that, japan, had, surrendered, in, his, address, the, showa, emperor, described, the, americans, as, having, used, a, most, unusual, and, cruel, bomb, that, had, just, destroyed, the, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, this, was, the, first, time, that, puyi, heard, of, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, which, the, japanese, had, not, seen, fit, to, tell, him, about, until, then, the, next, day, puyi, abdicated, as, emperor, of, manchukuo, and, declared, in, his, last, decree, that, manchukuo, was, once, again, part, of, china, puyi, s, party, split, up, in, a, panic, with, former, manchukuo, premier, zhang, jinghui, going, back, to, changchun, puyi, planned, to, take, a, plane, to, escape, from, tonghua, taking, with, him, his, brother, pujie, his, servant, big, li, yoshioka, and, his, doctor, while, leaving, wanrong, his, concubine, li, yuqin, lady, hiro, saga, and, lady, saga, s, two, children, behind, the, decision, to, leave, behind, the, women, and, children, was, in, part, made, by, yoshioka, who, thought, the, women, were, in, no, such, danger, and, vetoed, puyi, s, attempts, to, take, them, on, the, plane, to, japan, puyi, asked, for, lady, saga, the, most, mature, and, responsible, of, the, three, women, to, take, care, of, wanrong, and, he, gave, lady, saga, precious, antiques, and, cash, to, pay, for, their, way, south, to, korea, on, 16, august, puyi, took, a, small, plane, to, mukden, where, another, larger, plane, was, supposed, to, arrive, to, take, them, to, japan, but, instead, a, soviet, air, force, plane, landed, puyi, and, his, party, were, all, promptly, taken, prisoner, by, the, red, army, who, initially, did, not, know, who, puyi, was, the, opium, addled, wanrong, together, with, lady, saga, and, li, were, captured, by, chinese, communist, guerrillas, on, their, way, to, korea, after, one, of, puyi, s, brothers, in, law, informed, the, communists, who, the, women, were, wanrong, the, former, empress, was, put, on, display, in, a, local, jail, and, people, came, from, miles, around, to, watch, her, in, a, delirious, state, of, mind, she, demanded, more, opium, asked, for, imaginary, servants, to, bring, her, clothing, food, and, a, bath, hallucinated, that, she, was, back, in, the, forbidden, city, or, the, salt, tax, palace, the, general, hatred, for, puyi, meant, that, none, had, any, sympathy, for, wanrong, who, was, seen, as, another, japanese, collaborator, and, a, guard, told, lady, saga, that, this, one, won, t, last, making, it, a, waste, of, time, feeding, her, in, june, 1946, wanrong, starved, to, death, in, her, jail, cell, in, his, 1964, book, from, emperor, to, citizen, puyi, merely, stated, that, he, learned, in, 1951, that, wanrong, died, a, long, time, ago, without, mentioning, how, she, died, the, soviets, took, puyi, to, the, siberian, town, of, chita, he, lived, in, a, sanatorium, then, later, in, khabarovsk, near, the, chinese, border, where, he, was, treated, well, and, allowed, to, keep, some, of, his, servants, as, a, prisoner, puyi, spent, his, days, praying, and, expected, the, prisoners, to, treat, him, as, an, emperor, and, slapped, the, faces, of, his, servants, when, they, displeased, him, he, knew, about, the, civil, war, in, china, from, chinese, language, broadcasts, on, radio, moscow, but, seemed, not, to, care, the, soviet, government, refused, the, republic, of, china, s, repeated, requests, to, extradite, puyi, the, kuomintang, government, had, indicted, him, on, charges, of, high, treason, and, the, soviet, refusal, to, extradite, him, almost, certainly, saved, his, life, as, chiang, kai, shek, had, often, spoken, of, his, desire, to, have, puyi, shot, the, kuomintang, captured, puyi, s, cousin, dongzhen, and, publicly, executed, her, in, beijing, in, 1948, after, she, was, convicted, of, high, treason, not, wishing, to, return, to, china, puyi, wrote, to, stalin, several, times, asking, for, asylum, in, the, soviet, union, and, that, he, be, given, one, of, the, former, tsarist, palaces, to, live, out, his, days, in, 1946, puyi, testified, at, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, in, tokyo, detailing, his, resentment, at, how, he, had, been, treated, by, the, japanese, at, the, tokyo, trial, he, had, a, long, exchange, with, defence, counsel, major, ben, bruce, blakeney, about, whether, he, had, been, kidnapped, in, 1931, in, which, puyi, perjured, himself, by, saying, that, the, statements, in, johnston, s, 1934, book, twilight, in, the, forbidden, city, about, how, he, had, willingly, become, emperor, of, manchukuo, were, all, lies, when, blakeney, mentioned, that, the, introduction, to, the, book, described, how, puyi, had, told, johnston, that, he, had, willingly, gone, to, manchuria, in, 1931, puyi, denied, being, in, contact, with, johnston, in, 1931, and, that, johnston, made, things, up, for, commercial, advantage, puyi, had, a, strong, interest, in, minimizing, his, own, role, in, history, because, any, admission, of, active, control, would, have, led, to, his, execution, the, australian, judge, sir, william, webb, the, president, of, the, tribunal, was, often, frustrated, with, puyi, s, testimony, and, chided, him, numerous, times, behr, described, puyi, on, the, stand, as, a, consistent, self, assured, liar, prepared, to, go, to, any, lengths, to, save, his, skin, and, as, a, combative, witness, more, than, able, to, hold, his, own, against, the, defence, lawyers, since, no, one, at, the, trial, but, blakeney, had, actually, read, twilight, in, the, forbidden, city, or, the, interviews, woodhead, had, conducted, with, him, in, 1932, puyi, had, room, to, distort, what, had, been, written, about, him, or, said, by, him, puyi, greatly, respected, johnston, who, was, a, surrogate, father, to, him, and, felt, guilty, about, portraying, him, as, a, dishonest, man, after, his, return, to, the, soviet, union, puyi, was, held, at, detention, center, no, 45, where, his, servants, continued, to, make, his, bed, dress, him, and, do, other, work, for, him, puyi, did, not, speak, russian, and, had, limited, contacts, with, his, soviet, guards, using, a, few, manchukuo, prisoners, as, translators, one, prisoner, told, puyi, that, the, soviets, would, keep, him, in, siberia, forever, because, this, is, the, part, of, the, world, you, come, from, the, soviets, had, promised, the, chinese, communists, that, they, would, hand, over, the, high, value, prisoners, when, the, ccp, won, the, civil, war, and, wanted, to, keep, puyi, alive, puyi, s, brother, in, law, rong, qi, and, some, of, his, servants, were, not, considered, high, value, and, were, sent, to, work, at, a, siberian, rehabilitation, camp, when, the, chinese, communist, party, came, to, power, in, 1949, puyi, was, repatriated, to, china, after, negotiations, between, the, soviet, union, and, china, puyi, was, of, considerable, value, to, mao, as, behr, noted, in, the, eyes, of, mao, and, other, chinese, communist, leaders, pu, yi, the, last, emperor, was, the, epitome, of, all, that, had, been, evil, in, old, chinese, society, if, he, could, be, shown, to, have, undergone, sincere, permanent, change, what, hope, was, there, for, the, most, diehard, counter, revolutionary, the, more, overwhelming, the, guilt, the, more, spectacular, the, redemption, and, the, greater, glory, of, the, chinese, communist, party, puyi, was, to, be, subjected, to, remodelling, to, make, him, into, a, communist, in, 1950, the, soviets, loaded, puyi, and, the, rest, of, the, manchukuo, and, japanese, prisoners, onto, a, train, that, took, them, to, china, with, puyi, convinced, he, would, be, executed, when, he, arrived, puyi, was, surprised, at, the, kindness, of, his, chinese, guards, who, told, him, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, new, life, for, him, in, an, attempt, to, ingratiate, himself, puyi, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, addressed, commoners, with, the, formal, word, for, you, n, n, instead, of, the, informal, word, for, you, n, except, for, a, period, during, the, korean, war, when, he, was, moved, to, harbin, puyi, spent, ten, years, in, the, fushun, war, criminals, prison, in, liaoning, until, he, was, declared, reformed, the, prisoners, at, fushun, were, senior, japanese, manchukuo, and, kuomintang, officials, and, officers, puyi, was, the, weakest, and, most, hapless, of, the, prisoners, and, was, often, bullied, by, the, others, who, liked, to, humiliate, the, emperor, he, might, not, have, survived, his, imprisonment, had, the, warden, jin, yuan, not, gone, out, of, his, way, to, protect, him, puyi, had, never, brushed, his, teeth, or, tied, his, own, shoelaces, once, in, his, life, and, had, to, do, these, basic, tasks, in, prison, subjecting, him, to, the, ridicule, of, other, prisoners, in, 1951, puyi, learned, for, the, first, time, that, wanrong, had, died, in, 1946, much, of, puyi, s, remodelling, consisted, of, attending, marxism, leninism, and, mao, zedong, thought, discussion, groups, where, the, prisoners, would, discuss, their, lives, before, being, imprisoned, when, puyi, protested, to, jin, that, it, had, been, impossible, to, resist, japan, and, there, was, nothing, he, could, have, done, jin, confronted, him, with, people, who, had, fought, in, the, resistance, and, had, been, tortured, and, asked, him, why, ordinary, people, in, manchukuo, resisted, while, an, emperor, did, nothing, puyi, had, to, attend, lectures, where, a, former, japanese, civil, servant, spoke, about, the, exploitation, of, manchukuo, while, a, former, officer, in, the, kenpeitai, talked, about, how, he, rounded, up, people, for, slave, labour, and, ordered, mass, executions, at, one, point, puyi, was, taken, to, harbin, and, pingfang, to, see, where, the, infamous, unit, 731, the, chemical, and, biological, warfare, unit, in, the, japanese, army, had, conducted, gruesome, experiments, on, people, puyi, noted, in, shame, and, horror, all, the, atrocities, had, been, carried, out, in, my, name, puyi, by, the, mid, 1950s, was, overwhelmed, with, guilt, and, often, told, jin, that, he, felt, utterly, worthless, to, the, point, that, he, considered, suicide, jin, told, puyi, to, express, his, guilt, in, writing, puyi, later, recalled, he, felt, that, i, was, up, against, an, irresistible, force, that, would, not, rest, until, it, found, out, everything, sometimes, puyi, was, taken, out, for, tours, of, the, countryside, of, manchuria, on, one, he, met, a, farmer, s, wife, whose, family, had, been, evicted, to, make, way, for, japanese, settlers, and, had, almost, starved, to, death, while, working, as, a, slave, in, one, of, manchukuo, s, factories, when, puyi, asked, for, her, forgiveness, she, told, him, it, s, all, over, now, let, s, not, talk, about, it, causing, him, to, break, down, in, tears, at, another, meeting, a, woman, described, the, mass, execution, of, people, from, her, village, by, the, japanese, army, and, then, declared, that, she, did, not, hate, the, japanese, and, those, who, had, served, them, as, she, retained, her, faith, in, humanity, which, greatly, moved, puyi, on, another, occasion, jin, confronted, puyi, with, his, former, concubine, li, in, meetings, in, his, office, where, she, attacked, him, for, seeing, her, only, as, a, sex, object, and, saying, she, was, now, pregnant, by, a, man, who, loved, her, in, late, 1956, puyi, acted, in, a, play, the, defeat, of, the, aggressors, about, the, suez, crisis, playing, the, role, of, a, left, wing, labour, mp, who, challenges, in, the, house, of, commons, a, former, manchukuo, minister, playing, the, foreign, secretary, selwyn, lloyd, puyi, enjoyed, the, role, and, continued, acting, in, plays, about, his, life, and, manchukuo, in, one, he, played, a, manchukuo, functionary, and, kowtowed, to, a, portrait, of, himself, as, emperor, of, manchukuo, during, the, great, leap, forward, when, millions, of, people, starved, to, death, in, china, jin, chose, to, cancel, puyi, s, visits, to, the, countryside, lest, the, scenes, of, famine, undo, his, growing, faith, in, communism, behr, wrote, that, many, are, surprised, that, puyi, s, remodelling, worked, with, an, emperor, brought, up, as, almost, a, god, becoming, content, to, be, just, an, ordinary, man, but, he, noted, that, it, is, essential, to, remember, that, puyi, was, not, alone, in, undergoing, such, successful, remolding, tough, kmt, generals, and, even, tougher, japanese, generals, brought, up, in, the, samurai, tradition, and, the, bushido, cult, which, glorifies, death, in, battle, and, sacrifice, to, martial, japan, became, in, fushun, just, as, devout, in, their, support, of, communist, ideals, as, puyi, puyi, came, to, beijing, on, 9, december, 1959, with, special, permission, from, mao, and, lived, for, the, next, six, months, in, an, ordinary, beijing, residence, with, his, sister, before, being, transferred, to, a, government, sponsored, hotel, he, had, the, job, of, sweeping, the, streets, and, got, lost, on, his, first, day, of, work, which, led, him, to, tell, astonished, passers, by, i, m, puyi, the, last, emperor, of, the, qing, dynasty, i, m, staying, with, relatives, and, can, t, find, my, way, home, one, of, puyi, s, first, acts, upon, returning, to, beijing, was, to, visit, the, forbidden, city, as, a, tourist, he, pointed, out, to, other, tourists, that, many, of, the, exhibits, were, the, things, he, had, used, in, his, youth, he, voiced, his, support, for, the, communists, and, worked, as, a, gardener, at, the, beijing, botanical, gardens, the, role, brought, puyi, a, degree, of, happiness, he, had, never, known, as, an, emperor, though, he, was, notably, clumsy, behr, noted, that, in, europe, people, who, played, roles, analogous, to, the, role, puyi, played, in, manchukuo, were, generally, executed, for, example, the, british, hanged, william, joyce, for, being, the, announcer, on, the, english, language, broadcasts, of, radio, berlin, the, italians, shot, benito, mussolini, and, the, french, executed, pierre, laval, so, many, westerners, are, surprised, that, puyi, was, released, from, prison, after, only, nine, years, to, start, a, new, life, behr, wrote, that, the, communist, ideology, explained, this, difference, writing, in, a, society, where, all, landlord, and, capitalist, roaders, were, evil, incarnate, it, did, not, matter, so, much, that, puyi, was, also, a, traitor, to, his, country, he, was, in, the, eyes, of, the, communist, ideologues, only, behaving, true, to, type, if, all, capitalists, and, landlords, were, by, their, very, nature, traitors, it, was, only, logical, that, puyi, the, biggest, landlord, should, also, be, the, biggest, traitor, and, in, the, last, resort, puyi, was, far, more, valuable, alive, than, dead, in, early, 1960, puyi, met, premier, zhou, enlai, who, told, him, you, weren, t, responsible, for, becoming, emperor, at, the, age, of, three, or, the, 1917, attempted, restoration, coup, but, you, were, fully, to, blame, for, what, happened, later, you, knew, perfectly, well, what, you, were, doing, when, you, took, refuge, in, the, legation, quarter, when, you, travelled, under, japanese, protection, to, tianjin, and, when, you, agreed, to, become, manchukuo, chief, executive, puyi, responded, by, merely, saying, that, though, he, did, not, choose, to, be, an, emperor, he, had, behaved, with, savage, cruelty, as, boy, emperor, and, wished, he, could, apologize, to, all, the, eunuchs, he, had, flogged, during, his, youth, at, the, age, of, 56, he, married, li, shuxian, a, hospital, nurse, on, 30,

chinese, people, s, political, consultative, conference, where, his, monthly, salary, was, around, 100, yuan, li, recalled, in, a, 1995, interview, that, i, found, pu, yi, a, honest, man, a, man, who, desperately, needed, my, love, and, was, ready, to, give, me, as, much, love, as, he, could, when, i, was, having, even, a, slight, case, of, flu, he, was, so, worried, i, would, die, that, he, refused, to, sleep, at, night, and, sat, by, my, bedside, until, dawn, so, he, could, attend, to, my, needs, li, also, noted, like, everybody, else, who, knew, him, that, puyi, was, an, incredibly, clumsy, man, leading, her, to, say, once, in, a, boiling, rage, at, his, clumsiness, i, threatened, to, divorce, him, on, hearing, this, he, got, down, on, his, knees, and, with, tears, in, his, eyes, he, begged, me, to, forgive, him, i, shall, never, forget, what, he, said, to, me, i, have, nothing, in, this, world, except, you, and, you, are, my, life, if, you, go, i, will, die, but, apart, from, him, what, did, i, ever, have, in, the, world, puyi, showed, remorse, for, his, past, actions, often, telling, her, that, esterday, s, puyi, is, the, enemy, of, today, s, puyi, in, the, 1960s, with, encouragement, from, mao, and, zhou, and, the, public, endorsement, of, the, chinese, government, puyi, wrote, his, autobiography, from, emperor, to, citizen, chinese, pinyin, w, d, qi, n, b, nsh, ng, wade, giles, wo, te, ch, ien, pan, sheng, lit, the, first, half, of, my, life, together, with, li, wenda, an, editor, at, the, people, s, publishing, bureau, the, ghostwriter, li, had, initially, planned, to, use, puyi, s, autocritique, written, in, fushun, as, the, basis, of, the, book, expecting, the, job, to, take, only, a, few, months, but, it, used, such, wooden, language, as, puyi, confessed, to, a, career, of, abject, cowardice, that, li, was, forced, to, start, anew, it, took, four, years, to, write, the, book, puyi, said, of, his, testimony, at, the, tokyo, war, crimes, tribunal, i, now, feel, very, ashamed, of, my, testimony, as, i, withheld, some, of, what, i, knew, to, protect, myself, from, being, punished, by, my, country, i, said, nothing, about, my, secret, collaboration, with, the, japanese, imperialists, over, a, long, period, an, association, to, which, my, open, capitulation, after, 18, september, 1931, was, but, the, conclusion, instead, i, spoke, only, of, the, way, the, japanese, had, put, pressure, on, me, and, forced, me, to, do, their, will, i, maintained, that, i, had, not, betrayed, my, country, but, had, been, kidnapped, denied, all, my, collaboration, with, the, japanese, and, even, claimed, that, the, letter, i, had, written, to, jir, minami, was, a, fake, i, covered, up, my, crimes, to, protect, myself, puyi, objected, to, pujie, s, attempt, to, reunite, with, lady, saga, who, had, returned, to, japan, writing, to, zhou, asking, him, to, block, lady, saga, from, coming, back, to, china, which, led, zhou, to, reply, the, war, s, over, you, know, you, don, t, have, to, carry, this, national, hatred, into, your, own, family, behr, concluded, it, is, difficult, to, avoid, the, impression, that, puyi, in, an, effort, prove, himself, a, remolded, man, displayed, the, same, craven, attitude, towards, the, power, holders, of, the, new, china, that, he, had, shown, in, manchukuo, towards, the, japanese, many, of, the, claims, in, from, emperor, to, citizen, like, the, statement, that, it, was, the, kuomintang, who, stripped, manchuria, bare, of, industrial, equipment, in, 1945, 46, rather, than, the, soviets, together, with, an, unreservedly, rosy, picture, of, prison, life, are, widely, known, to, be, false, but, the, book, was, translated, into, foreign, languages, and, sold, well, behr, wrote, the, more, fulsome, clich, ridden, chapters, in, from, emperor, to, citizen, dealing, with, puyi, s, prison, experiences, and, written, at, the, height, of, the, mao, personality, cult, give, the, impression, of, well, learned, regurgitated, lessons, from, 1963, onward, puyi, regularly, gave, press, conferences, praising, life, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, foreign, diplomats, often, sought, him, out, curious, to, meet, the, famous, last, emperor, of, china, in, an, interview, with, behr, li, wenda, told, him, that, puyi, was, a, very, clumsy, man, who, invariably, forgot, to, close, doors, behind, him, forgot, to, flush, the, toilet, forgot, to, turn, the, tap, off, after, washing, his, hands, had, a, genius, for, creating, an, instant, disorderly, mess, around, him, puyi, had, been, so, used, to, having, his, needs, catered, to, that, he, never, entirely, learned, how, to, function, on, his, own, he, tried, very, hard, to, be, modest, and, humble, always, being, the, last, person, to, board, a, bus, which, meant, that, on, one, occasion, he, missed, the, ride, mistaking, the, bus, conductor, for, a, passenger, in, restaurants, he, would, tell, waitresses, you, should, not, be, serving, me, i, should, be, serving, you, during, this, period, puyi, was, known, for, his, kindness, and, once, after, he, accidentally, knocked, down, an, elderly, lady, with, his, bicycle, he, visited, her, every, day, in, the, hospital, to, bring, her, flowers, to, make, amends, until, she, was, released, the, cultural, revolution, broke, out, in, 1966, and, the, red,

although, his, food, rations, salary, and, various, luxuries, including, his, sofa, and, desk, were, removed, he, was, not, publicly, humiliated, as, was, common, at, the, time, the, red, guards, attacked, puyi, for, his, book, from, emperor, to, citizen, because, it, had, been, translated, into, english, and, french, which, displeased, the, red, guards, and, led, to, copies, of, the, book, being, burned, in, the, streets, various, members, of, the, qing, family, including, pujie, had, their, homes, raided, and, burned, by, red, guards, but, zhou, enlai, used, his, influence, to, protect, puyi, and, the, rest, of, the, qing, from, the, worst, abuses, inflicted, by, the, red, guard, jin, yuan, the, man, who, had, remodelled, puyi, in, the, 1950s, fell, victim, to, the, red,
