quote, from, well, known, marxist, works, but, also, from, the, relatively, obscure, works, during, this, period, mussolini, considered, himself, an, authoritarian, communist, and, a, marxist, and, he, described, karl, marx, as, the, greatest, of, all, theorists, of, socialism, in, 1913, he, published, giovanni, hus, il, veridico, jan, hus, true, prophet, a, historical, and, political,

and, negation, of, god, s, existence, mussolini, felt, that, socialism, had, faltered, in, view, of, the, failures, of, marxist, determinism, and, social, democratic, reformism, and, believed, that, nietzsche, s, ideas, would, strengthen, socialism, mussolini, s, writings, came, to, reflect, an, abandonment, of, marxism, and, egalitarianism, in, favour, of, nietzsche, s, bermensch, concept, and, anti, egalitarianism, when, world, war, i, began, in, august, 1914, many, socialist, parties, worldwide, followed, the, rising, nationalist, current, and, supported, their, country, s, intervention, in, the, war, in, italy, the, outbreak, of, the, war, created, a, surge, of, italian, nationalism, and, intervention, was, supported, by, a, variety, of, political, factions, one, of, the, most, prominent, and, popular, italian, nationalist, supporters, of, the, war, was, gabriele, d, annunzio, who, promoted, italian, irredentism, and, helped, sway, the, italian, public, to, support, intervention, the, italian, liberal, party, under, the, leadership, of, paolo, boselli, promoted, intervention, on, the, side, of, the, allies, and, utilised, the, societ, dante, alighieri, to, promote, italian, nationalism, italian, socialists, were, divided, on, whether, to, support, the, war, prior, to, mussolini, taking, a, position, on, the, war, a, number, of, revolutionary, syndicalists, had, announced, their, support, of, intervention, including, alceste, de, ambris, filippo, corridoni, and, angelo, oliviero, olivetti, the, italian, socialist, party, decided, to, oppose, the, war, after, anti, militarist, protestors, had, been, killed, resulting, in, a, general, strike, called, red, week, mussolini, initially, held, official, support, for, the, party, s, decision, and, in, an, august, 1914, article, mussolini, wrote, down, with, the, war, we, remain, neutral, he, saw, the, war, as, an, opportunity, both, for, his, own, ambitions, as, well, as, those, of, socialists, and, italians, he, was, influenced, by, anti, austrian, italian, nationalist, sentiments, believing, that, the, war, offered, italians, in, austria, hungary, the, chance, to, liberate, themselves, from, rule, of, the, habsburgs, he, eventually, decided, to, declare, support, for, the, war, by, appealing, to, the, need, for, socialists, to, overthrow, the, hohenzollern, and, habsburg, monarchies, in, germany, and, austria, hungary, who, he, said, had, consistently, repressed, socialism, mussolini, further, justified, his, position, by, denouncing, the, central, powers, for, being, reactionary, powers, for, pursuing, imperialist, designs, against, belgium, and, serbia, as, well, as, historically, against, denmark, france, and, against, italians, since, hundreds, of, thousands, of, italians, were, under, habsburg, rule, he, argued, that, the, fall, of, hohenzollern, and, habsburg, monarchies, and, the, repression, of, reactionary, turkey, would, create, conditions, beneficial, for, the, working, class, and, that, the, mobilisation, required, for, the, war, would, undermine, russia, s, reactionary, authoritarianism, and, bring, russia, to, social, revolution, he, said, that, for, italy, the, war, would, complete, the, process, of, risorgimento, by, uniting, the, italians, in, austria, hungary, into, italy, and, by, allowing, the, common, people, of, italy, to, be, participating, members, in, what, would, be, italy, s, first, national, war, thus, he, claimed, that, the, vast, social, changes, that, the, war, could, offer, meant, that, it, should, be, supported, as, a, revolutionary, war, as, mussolini, s, support, for, the, intervention, solidified, he, came, into, conflict, with, socialists, who, opposed, the, war, he, attacked, the, opponents, of, the, war, and, claimed, that, those, proletarians, who, supported, pacifism, were, out, of, step, with, the, proletarians, who, had, joined, the, rising, interventionist, vanguard, that, was, preparing, italy, for, a, revolutionary, war, he, began, to, criticise, the, italian, socialist, party, and, socialism, itself, for, having, failed, to, recognise, the, national, problems, that, had, led, to, the, outbreak, of, the, war, he, was, expelled, from, the, party, for, his, support, of, intervention, a, police, report, prepared, by, the, inspector, general, of, public, security, in, milan, g, gasti, describes, his, background, and, his, position, on, the, first, world, war, that, resulted, in, his, ousting, from, the, italian, socialist, party, professor, benito, mussolini, 38, revolutionary, socialist, has, a, police, record, elementary, school, teacher, qualified, to, teach, in, secondary, schools, former, first, secretary, of, the, chambers, in, cesena, forl, and, ravenna, after, 1912, editor, of, the, newspaper, avanti, to, which, he, gave, a, violent, suggestive, and, intransigent, orientation, in, october, 1914, finding, himself, in, opposition, to, the, directorate, of, the, italian, socialist, party, because, he, advocated, a, kind, of, active, neutrality, on, the, part, of, italy, in, the, war, of, the, nations, against, the, party, s, tendency, of, absolute, neutrality, he, withdrew, on, the, twentieth, of, that, month, from, the, directorate, of, avanti, then, on, the, fifteenth, of, november, thereafter, he, initiated, publication, of, the, newspaper, il, popolo, d, italia, in, which, he, supported, in, sharp, contrast, to, avanti, and, amid, bitter, polemics, against, that, newspaper, and, its, chief, backers, the, thesis, of, italian, intervention, in, the, war, against, the, militarism, of, the, central, empires, for, this, reason, he, was, accused, of, moral, and, political, unworthiness, and, the, party, thereupon, decided, to, expel, him, thereafter, he, undertook, a, very, active, campaign, in, behalf, of, italian, intervention, participating, in, demonstrations, in, the, piazzas, and, writing, quite, violent, articles, in, popolo, d, italia, in, his, summary, the, inspector, also, noted, he, was, the, ideal, editor, of, avanti, for, the, socialists, in, that, line, of, work, he, was, greatly, esteemed, and, beloved, some, of, his, former, comrades, and, admirers, still, confess, that, there, was, no, one, who, understood, better, how, to, interpret, the, spirit, of, the, proletariat, and, there, was, no, one, who, did, not, observe, his, apostasy, with, sorrow, this, came, about, not, for, reasons, of, self, interest, or, money, he, was, a, sincere, and, passionate, advocate, first, of, vigilant, and, armed, neutrality, and, later, of, war, and, he, did, not, believe, that, he, was, compromising, with, his, personal, and, political, honesty, by, making, use, of, every, means, no, matter, where, they, came, from, or, wherever, he, might, obtain, them, to, pay, for, his, newspaper, his, program, and, his, line, of, action, this, was, his, initial, line, it, is, difficult, to, say, to, what, extent, his, socialist, convictions, which, he, never, either, openly, or, privately, abjure, may, have, been, sacrificed, in, the, course, of, the, indispensable, financial, deals, which, were, necessary, for, the, continuation, of, the, struggle, in, which, he, was, engaged, but, assuming, these, modifications, did, take, place, he, always, wanted, to, give, the, appearance, of, still, being, a, socialist, and, he, fooled, himself, into, thinking, that, this, was, the, case, after, being, ousted, by, the, italian, socialist, party, mussolini, made, a, radical, transformation, ending, his, support, for, class, conflict, and, joining, in, support, of, revolutionary, nationalism, transcending, class, lines, he, formed, the, interventionist, newspaper, il, popolo, d, italia, and, the, fascio, rivoluzionario, d, azione, internazionalista, revolutionary, fasces, of, international, action, in, october, 1914, his, nationalist, support, of, intervention, enabled, him, to, raise, funds, from, ansaldo, an, armaments, firm, and, other, companies, to, create, il, popolo, d, italia, to, convince, socialists, and, revolutionaries, to, support, the, war, further, funding, for, mussolini, s, fascists, during, the, war, came, from, french, sources, beginning, in, may, 1915, a, major, source, of, this, funding, is, believed, to, have, been, from, french, socialists, who, sent, support, to, dissident, socialists, who, wanted, italian, intervention, on, france, s, side, on, 5, december, 1914, mussolini, denounced, orthodox, socialism, for, failing, to, recognise, that, the, war, had, made, national, identity, and, loyalty, more, significant, than, class, distinction, he, fully, demonstrated, his, transformation, in, a, speech, that, acknowledged, the, nation, as, an, entity, a, notion, he, had, rejected, prior, to, the, war, saying, the, nation, has, not, disappeared, we, used, to, believe, that, the, concept, was, totally, without, substance, instead, we, see, the, nation, arise, as, a, palpitating, reality, before, us, class, cannot, destroy, the, nation, class, reveals, itself, as, a, collection, of, interests, but, the, nation, is, a, history, of, sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and, race, class, can, become, an, integral, part, of, the, nation, but, the, one, cannot, eclipse, the, other, the, class, struggle, is, a, vain, formula, without, effect, and, consequence, wherever, one, finds, a, people, that, has, not, integrated, itself, into, its, proper, linguistic, and, racial, confines, where, the, national, problem, has, not, been, definitely, resolved, in, such, circumstances, the, class, movement, finds, itself, impaired, by, an, inauspicious, historic, climate, mussolini, continued, to, promote, the, need, of, a, revolutionary, vanguard, elite, to, lead, society, he, no, longer, advocated, a, proletarian, vanguard, but, instead, a, vanguard, led, by, dynamic, and, revolutionary, people, of, any, social, class, though, he, denounced, orthodox, socialism, and, class, conflict, he, maintained, at, the, time, that, he, was, a, nationalist, socialist, and, a, supporter, of, the, legacy, of, nationalist, socialists, in, italy, s, history, such, as, giuseppe, garibaldi, giuseppe, mazzini, and, carlo, pisacane, as, for, the, italian, socialist, party, and, its, support, of, orthodox, socialism, he, claimed, that, his, failure, as, a, member, of, the, party, to, revitalise, and, transform, it, to, recognise, the, contemporary, reality, revealed, the, hopelessness, of, orthodox, socialism, as, outdated, and, a, failure, this, perception, of, the, failure, of, orthodox, socialism, in, the, light, of, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, was, not, solely, held, by, mussolini, other, pro, interventionist, italian, socialists, such, as, filippo, corridoni, and, sergio, panunzio, had, also, denounced, classical, marxism, in, favour, of, intervention, these, basic, political, views, and, principles, formed, the, basis, of, mussolini, s, newly, formed, political, movement, the, fasci, d, azione, rivoluzionaria, in, 1914, who, called, themselves, fascisti, fascists, at, this, time, the, fascists, did, not, have, an, integrated, set, of, policies, and, the, movement, was, small, ineffective, in, its, attempts, to, hold, mass, meetings, and, was, regularly, harassed, by, government, authorities, and, orthodox, socialists, antagonism, between, the, interventionists, versus, the, anti, interventionist, orthodox, socialists, resulted, in, violence, between, the, fascists, and, socialists, these, early, hostilities, between, the, fascists, and, the, revolutionary, socialists, shaped, mussolini, s, conception, of, the, nature, of, fascism, in, its, support, of, political, violence, mussolini, became, an, ally, with, the, irredentist, politician, and, journalist, cesare, battisti, when, world, war, i, started, mussolini, like, many, italian, nationalists, volunteered, to, fight, he, was, turned, down, because, of, his, radical, socialism, and, told, to, wait, for, his, reserve, call, up, he, was, called, up, on, 31, august, and, reported, for, duty, with, his, old, unit, the, bersaglieri, after, a, two, week, refresher, course, he, was, sent, to, isonzo, front, where, he, took, part, in, the, second, battle, of, the, isonzo, september, 1915, his, unit, also, took, part, in, the, third, battle, of, the, isonzo, october, 1915, the, inspector, general, continued, he, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, corporal, for, merit, in, war, the, promotion, was, recommended, because, of, his, exemplary, conduct, and, fighting, quality, his, mental, calmness, and, lack, of, concern, for, discomfort, his, zeal, and, regularity, in, carrying, out, his, assignments, where, he, was, always, first, in, every, task, involving, labor, and, fortitude, mussolini, s, military, experience, is, told, in, his, work, diario, di, guerra, he, totalled, about, nine, months, of, active, front, line, trench, warfare, during, this, time, he, contracted, paratyphoid, fever, his, military, exploits, ended, in, february, 1917, when, he, was, wounded, accidentally, by, the, explosion, of, a, mortar, bomb, in, his, trench, he, was, left, with, at, least, 40, shards, of, metal, in, his, body, and, had, to, be, evacuated, from, the, front, he, was, discharged, from, the, hospital, in, august, 1917, and, resumed, his, editor, in, chief, position, at, his, new, paper, il, popolo, d, italia, on, 25, december, 1915, in, treviglio, he, married, his, compatriot, rachele, guidi, who, had, already, borne, him, a, daughter, edda, at, forl, in, 1910, in, 1915, he, had, a, son, with, ida, dalser, a, woman, born, in, sopramonte, a, village, near, trento, he, legally, recognised, this, son, on, 11, january, 1916, by, the, time, he, returned, from, service, in, the, allied, forces, of, world, war, i, mussolini, was, convinced, that, socialism, as, a, doctrine, had, largely, been, a, failure, in, 1917, mussolini, got, his, start, in, politics, with, the, help, of, a, 100, weekly, wage, the, equivalent, of, 7100, as, of, 2020, from, the, british, security, service, mi5, to, keep, anti, war, protestors, at, home, and, to, publish, pro, war, propaganda, in, early, 1918, mussolini, called, for, the, emergence, of, a, man, ruthless, and, energetic, enough, to, make, a, clean, sweep, to, revive, the, italian, nation, on, 23, march, 1919, mussolini, re, formed, the, milan, fascio, as, the, fasci, italiani, di, combattimento, italian, combat, squad, consisting, of, 200, members, the, ideological, basis, for, fascism, came, from, a, number, of, sources, mussolini, drew, from, the, works, of, plato, georges, sorel, nietzsche, and, the, economic, ideas, of, vilfredo, pareto, mussolini, admired, plato, s, the, republic, which, he, often, read, for, inspiration, the, republic, expounded, a, number, of, ideas, that, fascism, promoted, such, as, rule, by, an, elite, promoting, the, state, as, the, ultimate, end, opposition, to, democracy, protecting, the, class, system, and, promoting, class, collaboration, rejection, of, egalitarianism, promoting, the, militarisation, of, a, nation, by, creating, a, class, of, warriors, demanding, that, citizens, perform, civic, duties, in, the, interest, of, the, state, and, utilising, state, intervention, in, education, to, promote, the, development, of, warriors, and, future, rulers, of, the, state, the, idea, behind, mussolini, s, foreign, policy, was, that, of, spazio, vitale, vital, space, a, concept, in, italian, fascism, that, was, analogous, to, lebensraum, in, german, national, socialism, the, concept, of, spazio, vitale, was, first, announced, in, 1919, when, the, entire, mediterranean, especially, so, called, julian, march, was, redefined, to, make, it, appear, a, unified, region, that, had, belonged, to, italy, from, the, times, of, the, ancient, roman, province, of, italia, and, was, claimed, as, italy, s, exclusive, sphere, of, influence, the, right, to, colonise, the, neighbouring, slovene, ethnic, areas, and, the, mediterranean, being, inhabited, by, what, were, alleged, to, be, less, developed, peoples, was, justified, on, the, grounds, that, italy, was, allegedly, suffering, from, overpopulation, borrowing, the, idea, first, developed, by, enrico, corradini, before, 1914, of, the, natural, conflict, between, plutocratic, nations, like, britain, and, proletarian, nations, like, italy, mussolini, claimed, that, italy, s, principal, problem, was, that, plutocratic, countries, like, britain, were, blocking, italy, from, achieving, the, necessary, spazio, vitale, that, would, let, the, italian, economy, grow, mussolini, equated, a, nation, s, potential, for, economic, growth, with, territorial, size, thus, in, his, view, the, problem, of, poverty, in, italy, could, only, be, solved, by, winning, the, necessary, spazio, vitale, though, biological, racism, was, less, prominent, in, italian, fascism, than, in, national, socialism, right, from, the, start, the, spazio, vitale, concept, had, a, strong, racist, undercurrent, mussolini, asserted, there, was, a, natural, law, for, stronger, peoples, to, subject, and, dominate, inferior, peoples, such, as, the, barbaric, slavic, peoples, of, yugoslavia, he, stated, in, a, september, 1920, speech, when, dealing, with, such, a, race, as, slavic, inferior, and, barbarian, we, must, not, pursue, the, carrot, but, the, stick, policy, we, should, not, be, afraid, of, new, victims, the, italian, border, should, run, across, the, brenner, pass, monte, nevoso, and, the, dinaric, alps, i, would, say, we, can, easily, sacrifice, 500, 000, barbaric, slavs, for, 50, 000, italians, in, the, same, way, mussolini, argued, that, italy, was, right, to, follow, an, imperialist, policy, in, africa, because, he, saw, all, black, people, as, inferior, to, whites, mussolini, claimed, that, the, world, was, divided, into, a, hierarchy, of, races, though, this, was, justified, more, on, cultural, than, on, biological, grounds, and, that, history, was, nothing, more, than, a, darwinian, struggle, for, power, and, territory, between, various, racial, masses, mussolini, saw, high, birthrates, in, africa, and, asia, as, a, threat, to, the, white, race, mussolini, believed, that, the, united, states, was, doomed, as, the, american, blacks, had, a, higher, birthrate, than, whites, making, it, inevitable, that, the, blacks, would, take, over, the, united, states, to, drag, it, down, to, their, level, the, fact, that, italy, was, suffering, from, overpopulation, was, seen, as, proving, the, cultural, and, spiritual, vitality, of, the, italians, who, were, thus, justified, in, seeking, to, colonise, lands, that, mussolini, argued, on, a, historical, basis, belonged, to, italy, anyway, in, mussolini, s, thinking, demography, was, destiny, nations, with, rising, populations, were, nations, destined, to, conquer, and, nations, with, falling, populations, were, decaying, powers, that, deserved, to, die, hence, the, importance, of, natalism, to, mussolini, since, only, by, increasing, the, birth, rate, could, italy, ensure, its, future, as, a, great, power, by, mussolini, s, reckoning, the, italian, population, had, to, reach, 60, million, to, enable, italy, to, fight, a, major, war, hence, his, relentless, demands, for, italian, women, to, have, more, children, mussolini, and, the, fascists, managed, to, be, simultaneously, revolutionary, and, traditionalist, because, this, was, vastly, different, from, anything, else, in, the, political, climate, of, the, time, it, is, sometimes, described, as, the, third, way, the, fascisti, led, by, one, of, mussolini, s, close, confidants, dino, grandi, formed, armed, squads, of, war, veterans, called, blackshirts, or, squadristi, with, the, goal, of, restoring, order, to, the, streets, of, italy, with, a, strong, hand, the, blackshirts, clashed, with, communists, socialists, and, anarchists, at, parades, and, demonstrations, all, of, these, factions, were, also, involved, in, clashes, against, each, other, the, italian, government, rarely, interfered, with, the, blackshirts, actions, owing, in, part, to, a, looming, threat, and, widespread, fear, of, a, communist, revolution, the, fascisti, grew, rapidly, within, two, years, they, transformed, themselves, into, the, national, fascist, party, at, a, congress, in, rome, in, 1921, mussolini, won, election, to, the, chamber, of, deputies, for, the, first, time, in, the, meantime, from, about, 1911, until, 1938, mussolini, had, various, affairs, with, the, jewish, author, and, academic, margherita, sarfatti, called, the, jewish, mother, of, fascism, at, the, time, in, the, night, between, 27, and, 28, october, 1922, about, 30, 000, fascist, blackshirts, gathered, in, rome, to, demand, the, resignation, of, liberal, prime, minister, luigi, facta, and, the, appointment, of, a, new, fascist, government, on, the, morning, of, 28, october, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, who, according, to, the, albertine, statute, held, the, supreme, military, power, refused, the, government, request, to, declare, martial, law, which, led, to, facta, s, resignation, the, king, then, handed, over, power, to, mussolini, who, stayed, in, his, headquarters, in, milan, during, the, talks, by, asking, him, to, form, a, new, government, the, king, s, controversial, decision, has, been, explained, by, historians, as, a, combination, of, delusions, and, fears, mussolini, enjoyed, wide, support, in, the, military, and, among, the, industrial, and, agrarian, elites, while, the, king, and, the, conservative, establishment, were, afraid, of, a, possible, civil, war, and, thought, they, could, use, mussolini, to, restore, law, and, order, but, failed, to, foresee, the, danger, of, a, totalitarian, evolution, as, prime, minister, the, first, years, of, mussolini, s, rule, were, characterised, by, a, right, wing, coalition, government, of, fascists, nationalists, liberals, and, two, catholic, clerics, from, the, people, s, party, the, fascists, made, up, a, small, minority, in, his, original, governments, mussolini, s, domestic, goal, was, the, eventual, establishment, of, a, totalitarian, state, with, himself, as, supreme, leader, il, duce, a, message, that, was, articulated, by, the, fascist, newspaper, il, popolo, d, italia, which, was, now, edited, by, mussolini, s, brother, arnaldo, to, that, end, mussolini, obtained, from, the, legislature, dictatorial, powers, for, one, year, legal, under, the, italian, constitution, of, the, time, he, favoured, the, complete, restoration, of, state, authority, with, the, integration, of, the, italian, fasces, of, combat, into, the, armed, forces, the, foundation, in, january, 1923, of, the, voluntary, militia, for, national, security, and, the, progressive, identification, of, the, party, with, the, state, in, political, and, social, economy, he, passed, legislation, that, favoured, the, wealthy, industrial, and, agrarian, classes, privatisations, liberalisations, of, rent, laws, and, dismantlement, of, the, unions, in, 1923, mussolini, sent, italian, forces, to, invade, corfu, during, the, corfu, incident, the, league, of, nations, proved, powerless, and, greece, was, forced, to, comply, with, italian, demands, in, june, 1923, the, government, passed, the, acerbo, law, which, transformed, italy, into, a, single, national, constituency, it, also, granted, a, two, thirds, majority, of, the, seats, in, parliament, to, the, party, or, group, of, parties, that, received, at, least, 25, of, the, votes, this, law, applied, in, the, elections, of, 6, april, 1924, the, national, alliance, consisting, of, fascists, most, of, the, old, liberals, and, others, won, 64, of, the, vote, the, assassination, of, the, socialist, deputy, giacomo, matteotti, who, had, requested, that, the, elections, be, annulled, because, of, the, irregularities, provoked, a, momentary, crisis, in, the, mussolini, government, mussolini, ordered, a, cover, up, but, witnesses, saw, the, car, that, transported, matteotti, s, body, parked, outside, matteotti, s, residence, which, linked, amerigo, dumini, to, the, murder, mussolini, later, confessed, that, a, few, resolute, men, could, have, altered, public, opinion, and, started, a, coup, that, would, have, swept, fascism, away, dumini, was, imprisoned, for, two, years, on, his, release, dumini, allegedly, told, other, people, that, mussolini, was, responsible, for, which, he, served, further, prison, time, the, opposition, parties, responded, weakly, or, were, generally, unresponsive, many, of, the, socialists, liberals, and, moderates, boycotted, parliament, in, the, aventine, secession, hoping, to, force, victor, emmanuel, to, dismiss, mussolini, on, 31, december, 1924, mvsn, consuls, met, with, mussolini, and, gave, him, an, ultimatum, crush, the, opposition, or, they, would, do, so, without, him, fearing, a, revolt, by, his, own, militants, mussolini, decided, to, drop, all, pretense, of, democracy, on, 3, january, 1925, mussolini, made, a, truculent, speech, before, the, chamber, in, which, he, took, responsibility, for, squadristi, violence, though, he, did, not, mention, the, assassination, of, matteotti, he, did, not, abolish, the, squadristi, until, 1927, however, german, american, historian, konrad, jarausch, has, argued, that, mussolini, was, responsible, for, an, integrated, suite, of, political, innovations, that, made, fascism, a, powerful, force, in, europe, first, he, proved, the, movement, could, actually, seize, power, and, operate, a, comprehensive, government, in, a, major, country, second, the, movement, claimed, to, represent, the, entire, national, community, not, a, fragment, such, as, the, working, class, or, the, aristocracy, he, made, a, significant, effort, to, include, the, previously, alienated, catholic, element, he, defined, public, roles, for, the, main, sectors, of, the, business, community, rather, than, allowing, it, to, operate, backstage, third, he, developed, a, cult, of, one, man, leadership, that, focused, media, attention, and, national, debate, on, his, own, personality, as, a, former, journalist, mussolini, proved, highly, adept, at, exploiting, all, forms, of, mass, media, fourth, he, created, a, mass, membership, party, with, groups, that, could, be, more, readily, mobilised, and, monitored, like, all, dictators, he, made, liberal, use, of, the, threat, of, extrajudicial, violence, as, well, as, actual, violence, by, his, blackshirts, to, frighten, his, opposition, between, 1925, and, 1927, mussolini, progressively, dismantled, virtually, all, constitutional, and, conventional, restraints, on, his, power, and, built, a, police, state, a, law, passed, on, 24, december, 1925, christmas, eve, for, the, largely, roman, catholic, country, changed, mussolini, s, formal, title, from, president, of, the, council, of, ministers, to, head, of, the, government, although, he, was, still, called, prime, minister, by, most, non, italian, news, sources, he, was, no, longer, responsible, to, parliament, and, could, be, removed, only, by, the, king, while, the, italian, constitution, stated, that, ministers, were, responsible, only, to, the, sovereign, in, practice, it, had, become, all, but, impossible, to, govern, against, the, express, will, of, parliament, the, christmas, eve, law, ended, this, practice, and, also, made, mussolini, the, only, person, competent, to, determine, the, body, s, agenda, this, law, transformed, mussolini, s, government, into, a, de, facto, legal, dictatorship, local, autonomy, was, abolished, and, podest, s, appointed, by, the, italian, senate, replaced, elected, mayors, and, councils, while, italy, occupied, former, austro, hungarian, areas, between, years, 1918, and, 1920, five, hundred, slav, societies, for, example, sokol, and, slightly, smaller, number, of, libraries, reading, rooms, had, been, forbidden, specifically, so, later, with, the, law, on, associations, 1925, the, law, on, public, demonstrations, 1926, and, the, law, on, public, order, 1926, the, closure, of, the, classical, lyceum, in, pisino, of, the, high, school, in, voloska, 1918, and, the, five, hundred, slovene, and, croatian, primary, schools, followed, one, thousand, slav, teachers, were, forcibly, exiled, to, sardinia, and, to, southern, italy, on, 7, april, 1926, mussolini, survived, a, first, assassination, attempt, by, violet, gibson, on, 31, october, 1926, 15, year, old, anteo, zamboni, attempted, to, shoot, mussolini, in, bologna, zamboni, was, lynched, on, the, spot, mussolini, also, survived, a, failed, assassination, attempt, in, rome, by, anarchist, gino, lucetti, and, a, planned, attempt, by, the, italian, anarchist, michele, schirru, which, ended, with, schirru, s, capture, and, execution, all, other, parties, were, outlawed, following, zamboni, s, assassination, attempt, in, 1926, though, in, practice, italy, had, been, a, one, party, state, since, 1925, in, 1928, an, electoral, law, abolished, parliamentary, elections, instead, the, grand, council, of, fascism, selected, a, single, list, of, candidates, to, be, approved, by, plebiscite, if, voters, rejected, the, list, the, process, would, simply, be, repeated, until, it, was, approved, the, grand, council, had, been, created, five, years, earlier, as, a, party, body, but, was, constitutionalized, and, became, the, highest, constitutional, authority, in, the, state, on, paper, the, grand, council, had, the, power, to, recommend, mussolini, s, removal, from, office, and, was, thus, theoretically, the, only, check, on, his, power, however, only, mussolini, could, summon, the, grand, council, and, determine, its, agenda, to, gain, control, of, the, south, especially, sicily, he, appointed, cesare, mori, as, a, prefect, of, the, city, of, palermo, with, the, charge, of, eradicating, the, sicilian, mafia, in, the, telegram, mussolini, wrote, to, mori, your, excellency, has, carte, blanche, the, authority, of, the, state, must, absolutely, i, repeat, absolutely, be, re, established, in, sicily, if, the, laws, still, in, force, hinder, you, this, will, be, no, problem, as, we, will, draw, up, new, laws, mori, did, not, hesitate, to, lay, siege, to, towns, using, torture, and, holding, women, and, children, as, hostages, to, oblige, suspects, to, give, themselves, up, these, harsh, methods, earned, him, the, nickname, of, iron, prefect, in, 1927, mori, s, inquiries, brought, evidence, of, collusion, between, the, mafia, and, the, fascist, establishment, and, he, was, dismissed, for, length, of, service, in, 1929, at, which, time, the, number, of, murders, in, palermo, province, had, decreased, from, 200, to, 23, mussolini, nominated, mori, as, a, senator, and, fascist, propaganda, claimed, that, the, mafia, had, been, defeated, in, accordance, with, the, new, electoral, law, the, general, elections, took, the, form, of, a, plebiscite, in, which, voters, were, presented, with, a, single, pnf, dominated, list, according, to, official, figures, the, list, was, approved, by, 98, 43, of, voters, in, 1919, the, italian, state, had, brought, in, a, series, of, liberal, reforms, in, libya, that, allowed, education, in, arabic, and, berber, and, allowed, for, the, possibility, that, the, libyans, might, become, italian, citizens, giuseppe, volpi, who, had, been, appointed, governor, in, 1921, was, retained, by, mussolini, and, withdrew, all, of, the, measures, offering, equality, to, the, libyans, a, policy, of, confiscating, land, from, the, libyans, and, granting, it, to, italian, colonists, gave, new, vigor, to, libyan, resistance, led, by, omar, mukhtar, and, during, the, ensuing, pacification, of, libya, the, fascist, regime, waged, a, genocidal, campaign, designed, to, kill, as, many, libyans, as, possible, well, over, half, the, population, of, cyrenaica, were, confined, to, 15, concentration, camps, by, 1931, while, the, royal, italian, air, force, staged, chemical, warfare, attacks, against, the, bedouin, on, 20, june, 1930, marshal, pietro, badoglio, wrote, to, general, rodolfo, graziani, as, for, overall, strategy, it, is, necessary, to, create, a, significant, and, clear, separation, between, the, controlled, population, and, the, rebel, formations, i, do, not, hide, the, significance, and, seriousness, of, this, measure, which, might, be, the, ruin, of, the, subdued, population, but, now, the, course, has, been, set, and, we, must, carry, it, out, to, the, end, even, if, the, entire, population, of, cyrenaica, must, perish, on, 3, january, 1933, mussolini, told, the, diplomat, baron, pompei, aloisi, that, the, french, in, tunisia, had, made, an, appalling, blunder, by, permitting, sex, between, the, french, and, the, tunisians, which, he, predicted, would, lead, to, the, french, degenerating, into, a, nation, of, half, castes, and, to, prevent, the, same, thing, happening, to, the, italians, gave, orders, to, marshal, badoglio, that, miscegenation, be, made, a, crime, in, libya, mussolini, launched, several, public, construction, programs, and, government, initiatives, throughout, italy, to, combat, economic, setbacks, or, unemployment, levels, his, earliest, and, one, of, the, best, known, was, the, battle, for, wheat, by, which, 5, 000, new, farms, were, established, and, five, new, agricultural, towns, among, them, littoria, and, sabaudia, on, land, reclaimed, by, draining, the, pontine, marshes, in, sardinia, a, model, agricultural, town, was, founded, and, named, mussolinia, it, has, long, since, been, renamed, arborea, this, town, was, the, first, of, what, mussolini, hoped, would, be, thousands, of, new, agricultural, settlements, across, the, country, the, battle, for, wheat, diverted, valuable, resources, to, wheat, production, from, other, more, economically, viable, crops, landowners, grew, wheat, on, unsuitable, soil, using, all, the, advances, of, modern, science, and, although, the, wheat, harvest, increased, prices, rose, consumption, fell, and, high, tariffs, were, imposed, the, tariffs, promoted, widespread, inefficiencies, and, the, government, subsidies, given, to, farmers, pushed, the, country, further, into, debt, mussolini, also, initiated, the, battle, for, land, a, policy, based, on, land, reclamation, outlined, in, 1928, the, initiative, had, a, mixed, success, while, projects, such, as, the, draining, of, the, pontine, marsh, in, 1935, for, agriculture, were, good, for, propaganda, purposes, provided, work, for, the, unemployed, and, allowed, for, great, land, owners, to, control, subsidies, other, areas, in, the, battle, for, land, were, not, very, successful, this, program, was, inconsistent, with, the, battle, for, wheat, small, plots, of, land, were, inappropriately, allocated, for, large, scale, wheat, production, and, the, pontine, marsh, was, lost, during, world, war, ii, fewer, than, 10, 000, peasants, resettled, on, the, redistributed, land, and, peasant, poverty, remained, high, the, battle, for, land, initiative, was, abandoned, in, 1940, in, 1930, in, the, doctrine, of, fascism, he, wrote, the, so, called, crisis, can, only, be, settled, by, state, action, and, within, the, orbit, of, the, state, he, tried, to, combat, economic, recession, by, introducing, a, gold, for, the, fatherland, initiative, encouraging, the, public, to, voluntarily, donate, gold, jewellery, to, government, officials, in, exchange, for, steel, wristbands, bearing, the, words, gold, for, the, fatherland, the, collected, gold, was, melted, down, and, turned, into, gold, bars, which, were, then, distributed, to, the, national, banks, government, control, of, business, was, part, of, mussolini, s, policy, planning, by, 1935, he, claimed, that, three, quarters, of, italian, businesses, were, under, state, control, later, that, year, mussolini, issued, several, edicts, to, further, control, the, economy, e, g, forcing, banks, businesses, and, private, citizens, to, surrender, all, foreign, issued, stock, and, bond, holdings, to, the, bank, of, italy, in, 1936, he, imposed, price, controls, he, also, attempted, to, turn, italy, into, a, self, sufficient, autarky, instituting, high, barriers, on, trade, with, most, countries, except, germany, in, 1943, mussolini, proposed, the, theory, of, economic, socialisation, mussolini, was, keen, to, take, the, credit, for, major, public, works, in, italy, particularly, the, railway, system, his, reported, overhauling, of, the, railway, network, led, to, the, popular, saying, say, what, you, like, about, mussolini, he, made, the, trains, run, on, time, kenneth, roberts, journalist, and, novelist, wrote, in, 1924, the, difference, between, the, italian, railway, service, in, 1919, 1920, and, 1921, and, that, which, obtained, during, the, first, year, of, the, mussolini, regime, was, almost, beyond, belief, the, cars, were, clean, the, employees, were, snappy, and, courteous, and, trains, arrived, at, and, left, the, stations, on, time, not, fifteen, minutes, late, and, not, five, minutes, late, but, on, the, minute, in, fact, the, improvement, in, italy, s, dire, post, war, railway, system, had, begun, before, mussolini, took, power, the, improvement, was, also, more, apparent, than, real, bergen, evans, wrote, in, 1954, the, author, was, employed, as, a, courier, by, the, franco, belgique, tours, company, in, the, summer, of, 1930, the, height, of, mussolini, s, heyday, when, a, fascist, guard, rode, on, every, train, and, is, willing, to, make, an, affidavit, to, the, effect, that, most, italian, trains, on, which, he, travelled, were, not, on, schedule, or, near, it, there, must, be, thousands, who, can, support, this, attestation, it, s, a, trifle, but, it, s, worth, nailing, down, george, seldes, wrote, in, 1936, that, although, the, express, trains, carrying, tourists, generally, though, not, always, ran, on, schedule, the, same, was, not, true, for, the, smaller, lines, where, delays, were, frequent, while, ruth, ben, ghiat, has, said, that, they, improved, the, lines, that, had, a, political, meaning, to, them, mussolini, s, foremost, priority, was, the, subjugation, of, the, minds, of, the, italian, people, through, the, use, of, propaganda, the, regime, promoted, a, lavish, cult, of, personality, centered, on, the, figure, of, mussolini, he, pretended, to, incarnate, the, new, fascist, bermensch, promoting, an, aesthetic, of, exasperated, machismo, that, attributed, to, him, quasi, divine, capacities, at, various, times, after, 1922, mussolini, personally, took, over, the, ministries, of, the, interior, foreign, affairs, colonies, corporations, defence, and, public, works, sometimes, he, held, as, many, as, seven, departments, simultaneously, as, well, as, the, premiership, he, was, also, head, of, the, all, powerful, fascist, party, and, the, armed, local, fascist, militia, the, mvsn, or, blackshirts, who, terrorised, incipient, resistance, in, the, cities, and, provinces, he, would, later, form, the, ovra, an, institutionalised, secret, police, that, carried, official, state, support, in, this, way, he, succeeded, in, keeping, power, in, his, own, hands, and, preventing, the, emergence, of, any, rival, all, teachers, in, schools, and, universities, had, to, swear, an, oath, to, defend, the, fascist, regime, newspaper, editors, were, all, personally, chosen, by, mussolini, and, only, those, in, possession, of, a, certificate, of, approval, from, the, fascist, party, could, practice, journalism, these, certificates, were, issued, in, secret, mussolini, thus, skilfully, created, the, illusion, of, a, free, press, the, trade, unions, were, also, deprived, of, any, independence, and, were, integrated, into, what, was, called, the, corporative, system, the, aim, was, to, place, all, italians, in, various, professional, organisations, or, corporations, all, under, clandestine, governmental, control, large, sums, of, money, were, spent, on, highly, visible, public, works, and, on, international, prestige, projects, these, included, as, the, blue, riband, ocean, liner, ss, rex, setting, aeronautical, records, with, the, world, s, fastest, seaplane, the, macchi, m, c, 72, and, the, transatlantic, flying, boat, cruise, of, italo, balbo, which, was, greeted, with, much, fanfare, in, the, united, states, when, it, landed, in, chicago, in, 1933, the, principles, of, the, doctrine, of, fascism, were, laid, down, in, an, article, by, eminent, philosopher, giovanni, gentile, and, mussolini, himself, that, appeared, in, 1932, in, the, enciclopedia, italiana, mussolini, always, portrayed, himself, as, an, intellectual, and, some, historians, agree, gunther, called, him, easily, the, best, educated, and, most, sophisticated, of, the, dictators, and, the, only, national, leader, of, 1940, who, was, an, intellectual, german, historian, ernst, nolte, said, that, his, command, of, contemporary, philosophy, and, political, literature, was, at, least, as, great, as, that, of, any, other, contemporary, european, political, leader, nationalists, in, the, years, after, world, war, i, thought, of, themselves, as, combating, the, liberal, and, domineering, institutions, created, by, cabinets, such, as, those, of, giovanni, giolitti, including, traditional, schooling, futurism, a, revolutionary, cultural, movement, which, would, serve, as, a, catalyst, for, fascism, argued, for, a, school, for, physical, courage, and, patriotism, as, expressed, by, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, in, 1919, marinetti, expressed, his, disdain, for, the, by, now, prehistoric, and, troglodyte, ancient, greek, and, latin, courses, arguing, for, their, replacement, with, exercise, modelled, on, those, of, the, arditi, soldiers, it, was, in, those, years, that, the, first, fascist, youth, wings, were, formed, avanguardia, giovanile, fascista, fascist, youth, vanguards, in, 1919, and, gruppi, universitari, fascisti, fascist, university, groups, in, 1922, after, the, march, on, rome, that, brought, mussolini, to, power, the, fascists, started, considering, ways, to, politicise, italian, society, with, an, accent, on, education, mussolini, assigned, former, ardito, and, deputy, secretary, for, education, renato, ricci, the, task, of, reorganizing, the, youth, from, a, moral, and, physical, point, of, view, the, opera, nazionale, balilla, was, created, through, mussolini, s, decree, of, 3, april, 1926, and, was, led, by, ricci, for, the, following, eleven, years, it, included, children, between, the, ages, of, 8, and, 18, grouped, as, the, balilla, and, the, avanguardisti, according, to, mussolini, fascist, education, is, moral, physical, social, and, military, it, aims, to, create, a, complete, and, harmoniously, developed, human, a, fascist, one, according, to, our, views, the, educational, value, set, through, action, and, example, was, to, replace, the, established, approaches, fascism, opposed, its, version, of, idealism, to, prevalent, rationalism, and, used, the, opera, nazionale, balilla, to, circumvent, educational, tradition, by, imposing, the, collective, and, hierarchy, as, well, as, mussolini, s, own, personality, cult, another, important, constituent, of, the, fascist, cultural, policy, was, catholicism, in, 1929, a, concordat, with, the, vatican, was, signed, ending, decades, of, struggle, between, the, italian, state, and, the, papacy, that, dated, back, to, the, 1870, takeover, of, the, papal, states, by, the, house, of, savoy, during, the, unification, of, italy, the, lateran, treaty, by, which, the, italian, state, was, at, last, recognised, by, the, catholic, church, and, the, independence, of, vatican, city, was, recognised, by, the, italian, state, were, so, much, appreciated, by, the, ecclesiastic, hierarchy, that, pope, pius, xi, acclaimed, mussolini, as, the, man, of, providence, the, 1929, treaty, included, a, legal, provision, whereby, the, italian, government, would, protect, the, honour, and, dignity, of, the, pope, by, prosecuting, offenders, mussolini, had, had, his, children, baptised, in, 1923, and, himself, re, baptised, by, a, catholic, priest, in, 1927, after, 1929, mussolini, with, his, anti, communist, doctrines, convinced, many, catholics, to, actively, support, him, in, foreign, policy, mussolini, was, pragmatic, and, opportunistic, his, vision, centered, on, forging, a, new, roman, empire, in, africa, and, the, balkans, vindicating, the, so, called, mutilated, victory, of, 1918, imposed, by, britain, and, france, which, betrayed, the, treaty, of, london, and, denied, italy, its, natural, right, to, supremacy, in, the, mediterranean, however, in, the, 1920s, given, germany, s, weakness, post, war, reconstruction, and, reparations, issues, europe, s, situation, was, unfavorable, for, openly, revising, the, treaty, of, versailles, italy, s, foreign, policy, focused, on, maintaining, an, equidistant, stance, from, major, powers, to, exercise, determinant, weight, using, alignment, with, one, power, to, secure, support, for, italian, ambitions, in, europe, and, africa, mussolini, believed, that, italy, s, population, then, at, 40, million, was, insufficient, for, a, major, war, and, sought, to, increase, it, to, at, least, 60, million, through, relentless, natalist, policies, including, making, advocacy, of, contraception, a, criminal, offense, in, 1924, initially, mussolini, operated, as, a, pragmatic, statesman, seeking, advantages, without, risking, war, with, britain, and, france, an, exception, was, the, 1923, corfu, incident, where, mussolini, was, prepared, for, war, with, britain, over, the, assassination, of, italian, military, personnel, but, was, persuaded, to, accept, a, diplomatic, solution, by, the, italian, navy, s, leadership, in, 1925, mussolini, secretly, told, italian, military, leaders, that, italy, needed, to, win, spazio, vitale, aiming, to, unite, the, mediterranean, and, indian, ocean, under, italian, control, though, he, acknowledged, that, italy, lacked, sufficient, manpower, for, war, until, the, mid, 1930s, mussolini, participated, in, the, locarno, treaties, of, 1925, which, guaranteed, germany, s, western, borders, in, 1929, he, began, planning, for, aggression, against, france, and, yugoslavia, and, by, 1932, sought, an, anti, french, alliance, with, germany, a, planned, attack, on, france, and, yugoslavia, in, 1933, was, aborted, when, mussolini, learned, that, french, intelligence, had, broken, italian, military, codes, after, adolf, hitler, rose, to, power, threatening, italian, interests, in, austria, and, the, danube, basin, mussolini, proposed, the, four, power, pact, with, britain, france, and, germany, in, 1933, when, austrian, chancellor, engelbert, dollfuss, was, assassinated, in, 1934, by, austrian, nazis, during, a, coup, mussolini, threatened, hitler, with, war, in, the, event, of, a, german, invasion, of, austria, and, opposed, any, german, attempt, at, anschluss, promoting, the, stresa, front, against, germany, in, 1935, despite, earlier, opposition, to, the, italo, turkish, war, after, the, abyssinia, crisis, of, 1935, 1936, mussolini, invaded, ethiopia, following, border, incidents, between, ethiopia, and, italian, somaliland, historians, are, divided, on, the, reasons, for, the, invasion, some, argue, it, was, a, distraction, from, the, great, depression, while, others, see, it, as, part, of, a, broader, expansionist, program, italy, s, forces, quickly, overwhelmed, ethiopia, leading, to, the, proclamation, of, an, italian, empire, in, may, 1936, confident, of, french, support, due, to, his, opposition, to, hitler, mussolini, dismissed, the, league, of, nations, sanctions, imposed, over, the, ethiopian, invasion, he, viewed, the, sanctions, as, hypocritical, attempts, by, older, imperial, powers, to, block, italy, s, expansion, italy, was, criticized, for, its, use, of, mustard, gas, and, brutal, tactics, against, ethiopian, guerrillas, mussolini, ordered, systematic, terror, against, ethiopian, rebels, targeting, both, combatants, and, civilians, mussolini, ordered, the, execution, of, the, entire, adult, male, population, in, a, town, and, in, one, district, ordered, that, the, prisoners, their, accomplices, and, the, uncertain, will, have, to, be, executed, as, part, of, the, gradual, liquidation, of, the, population, mussolini, favoured, a, policy, of, brutality, partly, because, he, believed, the, ethiopians, were, not, a, nation, because, black, people, were, too, stupid, to, have, a, sense, of, nationality, the, other, reason, was, because, mussolini, was, planning, on, bringing, millions, of, italians, into, ethiopia, and, wanted, to, kill, off, much, of, the, population, to, make, room, sanctions, against, italy, pushed, mussolini, towards, an, alliance, with, germany, in, 1936, he, told, the, german, ambassador, that, italy, had, no, objections, to, austria, becoming, a, german, satellite, removing, a, key, obstacle, to, italo, german, relations, after, the, sanctions, ended, france, and, britain, tried, to, revive, the, stresa, front, seeking, to, retain, italy, as, an, ally, however, in, 1936, mussolini, agreed, to, the, rome, berlin, axis, with, germany, and, in, 1939, signed, the, pact, of, steel, binding, italy, and, germany, in, a, full, military, alliance, the, conquest, of, ethiopia, cost, 12, 000, italian, lives, and, placed, a, severe, financial, burden, on, italy, mussolini, had, underestimated, the, cost, of, the, invasion, which, proved, far, higher, than, expected, and, the, ongoing, occupation, further, strained, italy, s, economy, the, ethiopian, and, spanish, wars, consumed, funds, intended, for, military, modernization, weakening, italy, s, military, power, from, 1936, to, 1939, mussolini, provided, substantial, military, support, to, nationalists, in, the, spanish, civil, war, further, distancing, italy, from, france, and, britain, this, intervention, and, the, worsening, relationship, with, the, western, powers, led, mussolini, to, accept, the, german, annexation, of, austria, and, the, dismemberment, of, czechoslovakia, at, the, munich, conference, in, 1938, mussolini, posed, as, a, peacemaker, while, supporting, germany, s, annexation, of, the, sudetenland, in, 1938, tigr, a, slovene, partisan, group, plotted, to, assassinate, mussolini, in, kobarid, but, their, attempt, was, unsuccessful, by, the, late, 1930s, mussolini, concluded, that, britain, and, france, were, declining, powers, and, that, germany, and, italy, due, to, their, demographic, strength, were, destined, to, rule, europe, he, believed, that, the, declining, birth, rates, in, france, were, absolutely, horrifying, and, that, the, british, empire, was, doomed, because, one, quarter, of, the, british, population, was, over, 50, mussolini, preferred, an, alliance, with, germany, over, britain, and, france, viewing, it, as, better, to, be, allied, with, the, strong, instead, of, the, weak, he, saw, international, relations, as, a, social, darwinian, struggle, between, virile, nations, with, high, birth, rates, destined, to, destroy, effete, nations, with, low, birth, rates, mussolini, had, no, interest, in, an, alliance, with, france, which, he, considered, a, weak, and, old, nation, due, to, its, declining, birthrate, mussolini, s, belief, in, italy, s, destino, to, rule, the, mediterranean, led, him, to, neglect, serious, planning, for, a, war, with, the, western, powers, he, was, held, back, from, full, alignment, with, berlin, by, italy, s, economic, and, military, unpreparedness, and, his, desire, to, use, the, easter, accords, of, april, 1938, to, split, britain, from, france, a, military, alliance, with, germany, rather, than, the, looser, political, alliance, under, the, anti, comintern, pact, would, end, any, chance, of, britain, implementing, the, easter, accords, the, easter, accords, were, intended, by, mussolini, to, allow, italy, to, take, on, france, alone, with, the, hope, that, improved, anglo, italian, relations, would, keep, britain, neutral, in, a, franco, italian, war, mussolini, had, designs, on, tunisia, and, some, support, in, that, country, britain, in, turn, hoped, the, easter, accords, would, win, italy, away, from, germany, count, galeazzo, ciano, mussolini, s, son, in, law, and, foreign, minister, summed, up, the, dictator, s, objectives, regarding, france, in, his, diary, on, 8, november, 1938, djibouti, would, be, ruled, jointly, with, france, tunisia, with, a, similar, regime, and, corsica, under, italian, control, mussolini, showed, no, interest, in, savoy, considering, it, neither, historically, nor, geographically, italian, on, 30, november, 1938, mussolini, provoked, the, french, by, orchestrating, demonstrations, where, deputies, demanded, france, turn, over, tunisia, savoy, and, corsica, to, italy, this, led, to, heightened, tensions, with, france, and, italy, on, the, verge, of, war, through, the, winter, of, 1938, 39, in, january, 1939, british, prime, minister, neville, chamberlain, visited, rome, mussolini, learned, that, while, britain, wanted, better, relations, with, italy, it, would, not, sever, ties, with, france, this, realization, led, mussolini, to, grow, more, interested, in, the, german, offer, of, a, military, alliance, first, made, in, may, 1938, in, february, 1939, mussolini, declared, that, a, state, s, power, is, proportional, to, its, maritime, position, asserting, that, italy, was, a, prisoner, in, the, mediterranean, surrounded, by, british, controlled, territories, the, new, pro, german, course, was, controversial, on, 21, march, 1939, during, a, meeting, of, the, fascist, grand, council, italo, balbo, accused, mussolini, of, licking, hitler, s, boots, and, criticized, the, pro, german, policy, as, leading, italy, to, disaster, despite, some, internal, opposition, mussolini, s, control, of, foreign, policy, ensured, that, dissenting, voices, had, little, impact, in, april, 1939, mussolini, ordered, the, italian, invasion, of, albania, quickly, occupying, the, country, and, forcing, king, zog, i, to, flee, in, may, 1939, mussolini, signed, the, pact, of, steel, a, full, military, alliance, with, germany, after, securing, a, promise, from, hitler, that, there, would, be, no, war, for, three, years, despite, the, pact, mussolini, was, cautious, when, hitler, expressed, his, intent, to, invade, poland, ciano, warned, that, this, would, likely, lead, to, war, with, the, allies, hitler, dismissed, the, warning, suggesting, italy, should, invade, yugoslavia, although, tempted, mussolini, knew, that, italy, was, unprepared, for, a, global, conflict, particularly, given, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, s, demand, for, neutrality, thus, when, world, war, ii, began, with, germany, s, invasion, of, poland, on, 1, september, 1939, italy, remained, uninvolved, however, when, the, germans, arrested, 183, professors, from, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, in, november, 1939, mussolini, intervened, personally, resulting, in, the, release, of, 101, poles, as, world, war, ii, began, ciano, and, viscount, halifax, were, holding, secret, phone, conversations, the, british, wanted, italy, on, their, side, against, germany, as, it, had, been, in, world, war, i, french, government, opinion, was, more, geared, towards, action, against, italy, as, they, were, eager, to, attack, italy, in, libya, in, september, 1939, france, swung, to, the, opposite, extreme, offering, to, discuss, issues, with, italy, but, as, the, french, were, unwilling, to, discuss, corsica, nice, and, savoy, mussolini, did, not, answer, mussolini, s, under, secretary, for, war, production, carlo, favagrossa, had, estimated, that, italy, could, not, be, prepared, for, major, military, operations, until, 1942, due, to, its, relatively, weak, industrial, sector, compared, to, western, europe, in, late, november, 1939, adolf, hitler, declared, so, long, as, the, duce, lives, one, can, rest, assured, that, italy, will, seize, every, opportunity, to, achieve, its, imperialistic, aims, convinced, that, the, war, would, soon, be, over, with, a, german, victory, looking, likely, at, that, point, mussolini, decided, to, enter, the, war, on, the, axis, side, accordingly, italy, declared, war, on, britain, and, france, on, 10, june, 1940, mussolini, regarded, the, war, against, britain, and, france, as, a, life, or, death, struggle, between, opposing, ideologies, fascism, and, the, plutocratic, and, reactionary, democracies, of, the, west, describing, the, war, as, the, struggle, of, the, fertile, and, young, people, against, the, sterile, people, moving, to, the, sunset, it, is, the, struggle, between, two, centuries, and, two, ideas, italy, joined, the, germans, in, the, battle, of, france, fighting, the, fortified, alpine, line, at, the, border, just, eleven, days, later, france, and, germany, signed, an, armistice, included, in, italian, controlled, france, were, most, of, nice, and, other, southeastern, counties, mussolini, planned, to, concentrate, italian, forces, on, a, major, offensive, against, the, british, empire, in, africa, and, the, middle, east, known, as, the, parallel, war, while, expecting, the, collapse, of, the, uk, in, the, european, theatre, the, italians, invaded, egypt, bombed, mandatory, palestine, and, attacked, the, british, in, their, sudan, kenya, and, british, somaliland, colonies, in, what, would, become, known, as, the, east, african, campaign, british, somaliland, was, conquered, and, became, part, of, italian, east, africa, on, 3, august, 1940, and, there, were, italian, advances, in, the, sudan, and, kenya, with, initial, success, the, british, government, refused, to, accept, proposals, for, a, peace, that, would, involve, accepting, axis, victories, in, europe, plans, for, an, invasion, of, the, uk, did, not, proceed, and, the, war, continued, in, september, 1940, the, italian, tenth, army, was, commanded, by, general, rodolfo, graziani, and, crossed, from, italian, libya, into, egypt, where, british, forces, were, located, this, would, become, the, western, desert, campaign, advances, were, successful, but, the, italians, stopped, at, sidi, barrani, waiting, for, logistic, supplies, to, catch, up, on, 24, october, 1940, mussolini, sent, the, italian, air, corps, to, belgium, where, it, took, part, in, the, blitz, until, january, 1941, in, october, mussolini, also, sent, italian, forces, into, greece, starting, the, greco, italian, war, the, royal, air, force, prevented, the, italian, invasion, and, allowed, the, greeks, to, push, the, italians, back, to, albania, but, the, greek, counter, offensive, in, italian, albania, ended, in, a, stalemate, events, in, africa, had, changed, by, early, 1941, as, operation, compass, had, forced, the, italians, back, into, libya, causing, high, losses, in, the, italian, army, also, in, the, east, african, campaign, an, attack, was, mounted, against, italian, forces, despite, putting, up, some, resistance, they, were, overwhelmed, at, the, battle, of, keren, and, the, italian, defence, started, to, crumble, with, a, final, defeat, in, the, battle, of, gondar, when, addressing, the, italian, public, on, the, events, mussolini, was, open, about, the, situation, saying, we, call, bread, bread, and, wine, wine, and, when, the, enemy, wins, a, battle, it, is, useless, and, ridiculous, to, seek, as, the, english, do, in, their, incomparable, hypocrisy, to, deny, or, diminish, it, with, the, axis, invasion, of, yugoslavia, and, the, balkans, italy, annexed, ljubljana, dalmatia, and, montenegro, and, established, the, puppet, states, of, croatia, and, the, hellenic, state, general, mario, robotti, commander, of, the, italian, 11th, division, in, slovenia, and, croatia, issued, an, order, in, line, with, a, directive, received, from, mussolini, in, june, 1942, i, would, not, be, opposed, to, all, sic, slovenes, being, imprisoned, and, replaced, by, italians, in, other, words, we, should, take, steps, to, ensure, that, political, and, ethnic, frontiers, coincide, mussolini, first, learned, of, operation, barbarossa, after, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, had, begun, on, 22, june, 1941, and, was, not, asked, by, hitler, to, involve, himself, on, 25, june, 1941, he, inspected, the, first, units, at, verona, which, served, as, his, launching, pad, to, russia, mussolini, told, the, council, of, ministers, of, 5, july, that, his, only, worry, was, that, germany, might, defeat, the, soviet, union, before, the, italians, arrived, at, a, meeting, with, hitler, in, august, mussolini, offered, and, hitler, accepted, the, commitment, of, further, italian, troops, to, fight, the, soviet, union, the, heavy, losses, suffered, by, the, italians, on, the, eastern, front, where, service, was, extremely, unpopular, owing, to, the, widespread, view, that, this, was, not, italy, s, fight, did, much, to, damage, mussolini, s, prestige, with, the, italian, people, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, he, declared, war, on, the, united, states, on, 11, december, 1941, a, piece, of, evidence, regarding, mussolini, s, response, to, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, comes, from, the, diary, of, his, foreign, minister, ciano, a, night, telephone, call, from, ribbentrop, he, is, overjoyed, about, the, japanese, attack, on, america, he, is, so, happy, about, it, that, i, am, happy, with, him, though, i, am, not, too, sure, about, the, final, advantages, of, what, has, happened, one, thing, is, now, certain, that, america, will, enter, the, conflict, and, that, the, conflict, will, be, so, long, that, she, will, be, able, to, realize, all, her, potential, forces, this, morning, i, told, this, to, the, king, who, had, been, pleased, about, the, event, he, ended, by, admitting, that, in, the, long, run, i, may, be, right, mussolini, was, happy, too, for, a, long, time, he, has, favored, a, definite, clarification, of, relations, between, america, and, the, axis, following, vichy, france, s, collapse, and, the, case, anton, italy, occupied, the, french, territories, of, corsica, and, tunisia, italian, forces, had, also, achieved, victories, against, insurgents, in, yugoslavia, and, in, montenegro, and, italo, german, forces, had, occupied, parts, of, british, held, egypt, on, their, push, to, el, alamein, after, their, victory, at, gazala, although, mussolini, was, aware, that, italy, whose, resources, were, reduced, by, the, campaigns, of, the, 1930s, was, not, ready, for, a, long, war, he, opted, to, remain, in, the, conflict, to, not, abandon, the, occupied, territories, and, the, fascist, imperial, ambitions, by, 1943, italy, s, military, position, had, become, untenable, axis, forces, in, north, africa, were, defeated, in, the, tunisia, campaign, in, early, 1943, italy, suffered, major, setbacks, on, the, eastern, front, and, in, the, allied, invasion, of, sicily, the, italian, home, front, was, also, in, bad, shape, as, the, allied, bombings, were, taking, their, toll, factories, all, over, italy, were, brought, to, a, virtual, standstill, because, raw, materials, were, lacking, there, was, a, chronic, shortage, of, food, and, what, food, was, available, was, being, sold, at, nearly, confiscatory, prices, mussolini, s, once, ubiquitous, propaganda, machine, lost, its, grip, on, the, people, a, large, number, of, italians, turned, to, vatican, radio, or, radio, london, for, more, accurate, news, coverage, discontent, came, to, a, head, in, march, 1943, with, a, wave, of, labour, strikes, in, the, industrial, north, the, first, large, scale, strikes, since, 1925, also, in, march, some, of, the, major, factories, in, milan, and, turin, stopped, production, to, secure, evacuation, allowances, for, workers, families, the, german, presence, in, italy, had, sharply, turned, public, opinion, against, mussolini, when, the, allies, invaded, sicily, the, majority, of, the, public, there, welcomed, them, as, liberators, mussolini, feared, that, with, allied, victory, in, north, africa, allied, armies, would, come, across, the, mediterranean, and, attack, italy, in, april, 1943, as, the, allies, closed, into, tunisia, mussolini, had, urged, hitler, to, make, a, separate, peace, with, the, ussr, and, send, german, troops, to, the, west, to, guard, against, an, expected, allied, invasion, of, italy, the, allies, landed, in, sicily, on, 10, july, 1943, and, within, a, few, days, it, was, obvious, the, italian, army, was, on, the, brink, of, collapse, this, led, hitler, to, summon, mussolini, to, a, meeting, in, feltre, on, 19, july, 1943, by, this, time, mussolini, was, so, shaken, from, stress, that, he, could, no, longer, stand, hitler, s, boasting, his, mood, darkened, further, when, that, same, day, the, allies, bombed, rome, the, first, time, that, city, had, ever, been, the, target, of, enemy, bombing, it, was, obvious, by, this, time, that, the, war, was, lost, but, mussolini, could, not, extricate, himself, from, the, german, alliance, by, this, point, some, prominent, members, of, mussolini, s, government, had, turned, against, him, including, grandi, and, ciano, several, of, his, colleagues, were, close, to, revolt, and, mussolini, was, forced, to, summon, the, grand, council, on, 24, july, 1943, this, was, the, first, time, the, body, had, met, since, the, start, of, the, war, when, he, announced, that, the, germans, were, thinking, of, evacuating, the, south, grandi, launched, a, blistering, attack, on, him, grandi, moved, a, resolution, asking, the, king, to, resume, his, full, constitutional, powers, in, effect, a, vote, of, no, confidence, in, mussolini, this, motion, carried, by, a, 19, 8, margin, mussolini, showed, little, visible, reaction, even, though, this, effectively, authorised, the, king, to, sack, him, he, did, however, ask, grandi, to, consider, the, possibility, that, this, motion, would, spell, the, end, of, fascism, the, vote, although, significant, had, no, de, jure, effect, since, the, prime, minister, was, only, responsible, to, the, king, despite, this, sharp, rebuke, mussolini, showed, up, for, work, the, next, day, as, usual, he, allegedly, viewed, the, grand, council, as, merely, an, advisory, body, and, did, not, think, the, vote, would, have, any, substantive, effect, that, afternoon, at, 17, 00, he, was, summoned, to, the, royal, palace, by, victor, emmanuel, by, then, victor, emmanuel, had, already, decided, to, sack, him, the, king, had, arranged, an, escort, for, mussolini, and, had, the, government, building, surrounded, by, 200, carabinieri, mussolini, was, unaware, of, these, moves, by, the, king, and, tried, to, tell, him, about, the, grand, council, meeting, victor, emmanuel, cut, him, off, and, formally, dismissed, him, from, office, although, guaranteeing, his, immunity, after, mussolini, left, the, palace, he, was, arrested, by, the, carabinieri, on, the, king, s, orders, the, police, took, mussolini, in, a, red, cross, ambulance, car, without, specifying, his, destination, and, assuring, him, that, they, were, doing, it, for, his, own, safety, by, this, time, discontent, with, mussolini, was, so, intense, that, when, the, news, of, his, downfall, was, announced, on, the, radio, there, was, no, resistance, of, any, sort, people, rejoiced, because, they, believed, that, the, end, of, mussolini, also, meant, the, end, of, the, war, the, king, appointed, marshal, pietro, badoglio, as, the, prime, minister, in, an, effort, to, conceal, his, location, from, the, germans, mussolini, was, moved, around, first, to, ponza, then, to, la, maddalena, before, being, imprisoned, at, campo, imperatore, a, mountain, resort, in, abruzzo, where, he, was, completely, isolated, badoglio, kept, up, the, appearance, of, loyalty, to, germany, and, announced, that, italy, would, continue, fighting, on, the, side, of, the, axis, however, he, dissolved, the, fascist, party, two, days, after, taking, over, and, began, negotiating, with, the, allies, on, 3, september, 1943, badoglio, agreed, to, an, armistice, between, italy, and, allied, armed, forces, its, announcement, five, days, later, threw, italy, into, chaos, german, troops, seized, control, in, operation, achse, as, the, germans, approached, rome, badoglio, and, the, king, fled, with, their, main, collaborators, to, apulia, putting, themselves, under, the, protection, of, the, allies, but, leaving, the, italian, army, without, orders, after, a, period, of, anarchy, they, formed, a, government, in, malta, and, finally, declared, war, on, germany, on, 13, october, 1943, several, thousand, italian, troops, joined, the, allies, to, fight, against, the, germans, most, others, deserted, or, surrendered, to, the, germans, some, refused, to, switch, sides, and, joined, the, germans, the, badoglio, government, agreed, to, a, political, truce, with, the, predominantly, leftist, partisans, for, the, sake, of, italy, and, to, rid, the, land, of, the, nazis, only, two, months, after, mussolini, had, been, dismissed, and, arrested, he, was, rescued, from, his, prison, at, the, hotel, campo, imperatore, in, the, gran, sasso, raid, on, 12, september, 1943, by, a, special, fallschirmj, ger, paratroopers, unit, and, waffen, ss, commandos, led, by, major, otto, harald, mors, otto, skorzeny, was, also, present, the, rescue, saved, mussolini, from, being, turned, over, to, the, allies, in, accordance, with, the, armistice, hitler, had, made, plans, to, arrest, the, king, the, crown, prince, umberto, badoglio, and, the, rest, of, the, government, and, restore, mussolini, to, power, in, rome, but, the, government, s, escape, south, likely, foiled, those, plans, three, days, after, his, rescue, in, the, gran, sasso, raid, mussolini, was, taken, to, germany, for, a, meeting, with, hitler, in, rastenburg, at, his, east, prussian, headquarters, despite, his, public, support, hitler, was, clearly, shocked, by, mussolini, s, dishevelled, and, haggard, appearance, as, well, as, his, unwillingness, to, go, after, the, men, in, rome, who, overthrew, him, feeling, that, he, had, to, do, what, he, could, to, blunt, the, edges, of, nazi, repression, mussolini, agreed, to, set, up, a, new, regime, the, italian, social, republic, italian, repubblica, sociale, italiana, rsi, informally, known, as, the, sal, republic, because, of, its, seat, in, the, town, of, sal, where, he, was, settled, 11, days, after, his, rescue, by, the, germans, his, new, regime, was, much, reduced, in, territory, in, addition, to, losing, the, italian, lands, held, by, the, allies, and, badoglio, s, government, the, provinces, of, bolzano, belluno, and, trento, were, placed, under, german, administration, in, the, operational, zone, of, the, alpine, foothills, while, the, provinces, of, udine, gorizia, trieste, pola, now, pula, fiume, now, rijeka, and, ljubljana, lubiana, in, italian, were, incorporated, into, the, german, operational, zone, of, the, adriatic, littoral, additionally, german, forces, occupied, the, dalmatian, provinces, of, split, spalato, and, kotor, cattaro, which, were, subsequently, annexed, by, the, croatian, fascist, regime, italy, s, conquests, in, greece, and, albania, were, also, lost, to, germany, with, the, exception, of, the, italian, islands, of, the, aegean, which, remained, nominally, under, rsi, rule, mussolini, opposed, any, territorial, reductions, of, the, italian, state, and, told, his, associates, i, am, not, here, to, renounce, even, a, square, meter, of, state, territory, we, will, go, back, to, war, for, this, and, we, will, rebel, against, anyone, for, this, where, the, italian, flag, flew, the, italian, flag, will, return, and, where, it, has, not, been, lowered, now, that, i, am, here, no, one, will, have, it, lowered, i, have, said, these, things, to, the, f, hrer, for, about, a, year, and, a, half, mussolini, lived, in, gargnano, on, lake, garda, in, lombardy, although, he, insisted, in, public, that, he, was, in, full, control, he, knew, he, was, a, puppet, ruler, under, the, protection, of, his, german, liberators, for, all, intents, and, purposes, the, gauleiter, of, lombardy, indeed, he, lived, under, what, amounted, to, house, arrest, by, the, ss, who, restricted, his, communications, and, travel, he, told, one, of, his, colleagues, that, being, sent, to, a, concentration, camp, would, be, preferable, yielding, to, pressure, from, hitler, and, the, remaining, loyal, fascists, who, formed, the, government, of, the, republic, of, sal, mussolini, helped, orchestrate, executions, of, some, of, the, leaders, who, had, betrayed, him, at, the, last, meeting, of, the, fascist, grand, council, one, of, those, executed, was, his, son, in, law, galeazzo, ciano, as, head, of, state, and, minister, of, foreign, affairs, for, the, italian, social, republic, mussolini, used, much, of, his, time, to, write, his, memoirs, along, with, his, autobiographical, writings, of, 1928, these, writings, would, be, combined, and, published, by, da, capo, press, as, my, rise, and, fall, in, an, interview, in, january, 1945, by, madeleine, mollier, a, few, months, before, he, was, captured, and, executed, he, stated, flatly, seven, years, ago, i, was, an, interesting, person, now, i, am, little, more, than, a, corpse, he, continued, yes, madam, i, am, finished, my, star, has, fallen, i, have, no, fight, left, in, me, i, work, and, i, try, yet, know, that, all, is, but, a, farce, i, await, the, end, of, the, tragedy, and, strangely, detached, from, everything, i, do, not, feel, any, more, an, actor, i, feel, i, am, the, last, of, spectators, on, 25, april, 1945, allied, troops, were, advancing, into, northern, italy, and, the, collapse, of, the, sal, republic, was, imminent, mussolini, and, his, mistress, clara, petacci, set, out, for, switzerland, intending, to, board, a, plane, and, escape, to, spain, two, days, later, on, 27, april, they, were, stopped, near, the, village, of, dongo, lake, como, by, communist, partisans, named, valerio, and, bellini, and, identified, by, the, political, commissar, of, the, partisans, 52nd, garibaldi, brigade, urbano, lazzaro, petacci, s, brother, posed, as, a, spanish, consul, with, the, spread, of, the, news, of, the, arrest, several, telegrams, arrived, at, the, command, of, the, national, liberation, committee, for, northern, italy, from, the, office, of, strategic, services, headquarters, in, siena, with, the, request, that, mussolini, be, entrusted, to, allied, forces, in, fact, clause, number, 29, of, the, armistice, signed, in, malta, by, eisenhower, and, the, marshal, of, italy, pietro, badoglio, on, 29, september, 1943, expressly, provided, that, benito, mussolini, his, main, fascist, associates, and, all, persons, suspected, of, having, committed, crimes, of, war, or, similar, crimes, whose, names, are, on, the, lists, that, will, be, delivered, by, the, united, nations, and, which, now, or, in, the, future, are, in, territory, controlled, by, the, allied, military, command, or, by, the, italian, government, will, be, immediately, arrested, and, handed, over, to, the, united, nations, forces, the, next, day, mussolini, and, petacci, were, both, summarily, shot, along, with, most, of, the, members, of, their, 15, man, train, primarily, ministers, and, officials, of, the, italian, social, republic, the, shootings, took, place, in, the, small, village, of, giulino, di, mezzegra, and, were, conducted, by, a, partisan, leader, with, the, nom, de, guerre, colonnello, valerio, his, real, identity, is, unknown, but, conventionally, he, is, thought, to, have, been, walter, audisio, who, always, claimed, to, have, carried, out, the, execution, though, another, partisan, controversially, alleged, that, colonnello, valerio, was, luigi, longo, subsequently, a, leading, communist, politician, on, 29, april, 1945, the, bodies, of, mussolini, petacci, and, the, other, executed, fascists, were, loaded, into, a, van, and, moved, south, to, milan, at, 3, 00, a, m, the, corpses, were, dumped, on, the, ground, in, the, old, piazzale, loreto, the, piazza, had, been, renamed, piazza, quindici, martiri, fifteen, martyrs, square, in, honour, of, fifteen, italian, partisans, recently, executed, there, after, being, kicked, and, spat, upon, the, bodies, were, hung, upside, down, from, the, roof, of, a, service, station, and, stoned, from, below, by, civilians, this, was, done, both, to, discourage, any, fascists, from, continuing, the, fight, and, as, an, act, of, revenge, for, the, hanging, of, partisans, in, the, same, place, by, axis, authorities, the, corpse, of, the, deposed, leader, was, subject, to, ridicule, and, abuse, fascist, loyalist, achille, starace, was, captured, and, sentenced, to, death, then, taken, to, the, piazzale, loreto, and, shown, the, body, of, mussolini, which, he, saluted, just, before, being, shot, his, body, was, strung, up, beside, mussolini, s, mussolini, s, first, wife, was, ida, dalser, whom, he, married, in, trento, in, 1914, the, couple, had, a, son, the, following, year, and, named, him, benito, albino, mussolini, in, december, 1915, mussolini, married, rachele, guidi, who, had, been, his, mistress, since, 1910, due, to, his, upcoming, political, ascendency, the, information, about, his, first, marriage, was, suppressed, and, both, his, first, wife, and, son, were, later, persecuted, with, rachele, mussolini, had, two, daughters, edda, and, anna, maria, the, latter, of, whom, married, nando, pucci, negri, in, ravenna, on, 11, june, 1960, and, three, sons, vittorio, bruno, and, romano, mussolini, had, several, mistresses, among, them, margherita, sarfatti, and, his, final, companion, clara, petacci, mussolini, had, many, brief, sexual, encounters, with, female, supporters, as, reported, by, his, biographer, nicholas, farrell, imprisonment, may, have, been, the, cause, of, mussolini, s, claustrophobia, he, refused, to, enter, the, blue, grotto, and, preferred, large, rooms, like, his, 18, by, 12, by, 12, m, 60, by, 40, by, 40, feet, office, at, the, palazzo, venezia, in, addition, to, his, native, italian, mussolini, spoke, english, french, and, sufficient, german, to, dispense, with, an, interpreter, this, was, notable, at, the, munich, conference, as, no, other, national, leader, spoke, anything, other, than, his, native, language, mussolini, was, described, as, effectively, being, the, chief, interpreter, mussolini, was, raised, by, a, devoutly, catholic, mother, and, an, anti, clerical, father, his, mother, rosa, had, him, baptised, into, the, roman, catholic, church, and, took, her, children, to, services, every, sunday, his, father, never, attended, mussolini, regarded, his, time, at, a, religious, boarding, school, as, punishment, compared, the, experience, to, hell, and, once, refused, to, go, to, morning, mass, and, had, to, be, dragged, there, by, force, mussolini, became, anti, clerical, like, his, father, as, a, young, man, he, proclaimed, himself, to, be, an, atheist, and, several, times, tried, to, shock, an, audience, by, calling, on, god, to, strike, him, dead, he, believed, that, science, had, proven, there, was, no, god, and, that, the, historical, jesus, was, ignorant, and, mad, he, considered, religion, a, disease, of, the, psyche, and, accused, christianity, of, promoting, resignation, and, cowardice, mussolini, is, claimed, to, be, superstitious, because, after, hearing, of, the, curse, of, the, pharaohs, he, ordered, the, immediate, removal, of, an, egyptian, mummy, that, he, had, been, gifted, from, the, palazzo, chigi, mussolini, was, an, admirer, of, friedrich, nietzsche, according, to, denis, mack, smith, in, nietzsche, he, found, justification, for, his, crusade, against, the, christian, virtues, of, humility, resignation, charity, and, goodness, he, valued, nietzsche, s, concept, of, the, superman, the, supreme, egoist, who, defied, both, god, and, the, masses, who, despised, egalitarianism, and, democracy, who, believed, in, the, weakest, going, to, the, wall, and, pushing, them, if, they, did, not, go, fast, enough, on, his, 60th, birthday, mussolini, received, a, gift, from, hitler, of, a, complete, twenty, four, volume, set, of, the, works, of, nietzsche, mussolini, made, vitriolic, attacks, against, christianity, and, the, catholic, church, which, he, accompanied, with, provocative, remarks, about, the, consecrated, host, and, about, a, love, affair, between, christ, and, mary, magdalene, he, denounced, socialists, who, were, tolerant, of, religion, or, who, had, their, children, baptised, and, called, for, socialists, who, accepted, religious, marriage, to, be, expelled, from, the, party, he, denounced, the, catholic, church, for, its, authoritarianism, and, refusal, to, allow, freedom, of, thought, mussolini, s, newspaper, la, lotta, di, classe, reportedly, had, an, anti, christian, editorial, stance, despite, making, such, attacks, mussolini, tried, to, win, popular, support, by, appeasing, the, catholic, majority, in, italy, in, 1924, mussolini, saw, that, three, of, his, children, were, given, communion, in, 1925, he, had, a, priest, perform, a, religious, marriage, ceremony, for, himself, and, his, wife, rachele, whom, he, had, married, in, a, civil, ceremony, 10, years, earlier, on, 11, february, 1929, he, signed, a, concordat, and, treaty, with, the, roman, catholic, church, under, the, lateran, pact, vatican, city, was, granted, independent, statehood, and, placed, under, church, law, rather, than, italian, law, and, the, catholic, religion, was, recognised, as, italy, s, state, religion, the, church, also, regained, authority, over, marriage, catholicism, could, be, taught, in, all, secondary, schools, birth, control, and, freemasonry, were, banned, and, the, clergy, received, subsidies, from, the, state, and, was, exempted, from, taxation, pope, pius, xi, praised, mussolini, and, the, official, catholic, newspaper, pronounced, italy, has, been, given, back, to, god, and, god, to, italy, after, this, conciliation, he, claimed, the, church, was, subordinate, to, the, state, and, referred, to, catholicism, as, in, origin, a, minor, sect, that, had, spread, beyond, palestine, only, because, grafted, onto, the, organization, of, the, roman, empire, after, the, concordat, he, confiscated, more, issues, of, catholic, newspapers, in, the, next, three, months, than, in, the, previous, seven, years, mussolini, reportedly, came, close, to, being, excommunicated, from, the, catholic, church, around, this, time, mussolini, publicly, reconciled, with, the, pope, pius, xi, in, 1932, but, took, care, to, exclude, from, the, newspapers, any, photography, of, himself, kneeling, or, showing, deference, to, the, pope, he, wanted, to, persuade, catholics, that, ascism, was, catholic, and, he, himself, a, believer, who, spent, some, of, each, day, in, prayer, the, pope, began, referring, to, mussolini, as, a, man, sent, by, providence, despite, mussolini, s, efforts, to, appear, pious, by, order, of, his, party, pronouns, referring, to, him, had, to, be, capitalized, like, those, referring, to, god, in, 1938, mussolini, began, reasserting, his, anti, clericalism, he, would, sometimes, refer, to, himself, as, an, outright, disbeliever, and, once, told, his, cabinet, that, islam, was, perhaps, a, more, effective, religion, than, christianity, and, that, the, papacy, was, a, malignant, tumor, in, the, body, of, italy, and, must, be, rooted, out, once, and, for, all, because, there, was, no, room, in, rome, for, both, the, pope, and, himself, he, publicly, backed, down, from, these, anti, clerical, statements, but, continued, making, similar, statements, in, private, after, his, fall, from, power, in, 1943, mussolini, began, speaking, more, about, god, and, the, obligations, of, conscience, although, he, still, had, little, use, for, the, priests, and, sacraments, of, the, church, he, also, began, drawing, parallels, between, himself, and, jesus, christ, mussolini, s, widow, rachele, stated, that, her, husband, had, remained, basically, irreligious, until, the, later, years, of, his, life, mussolini, was, given, a, funeral, in, 1957, when, his, remains, were, placed, in, the, family, crypt, over, the, span, of, his, career, mussolini, s, views, and, policies, regarding, jews, and, antisemitism, were, often, inconsistent, contradictory, and, radically, shifted, depending, on, the, situation, most, historians, have, generally, labeled, him, as, a, political, opportunist, when, it, came, to, the, treatment, of, the, jews, rather, than, following, a, sincere, belief, mussolini, considered, italian, jews, to, be, italians, but, this, belief, may, have, been, influenced, more, by, his, anti, clericalism, and, the, general, mood, of, italy, at, the, time, which, denounced, the, abusive, treatment, of, the, jews, in, the, roman, ghetto, by, the, papal, states, until, the, unification, of, italy, although, mussolini, had, initially, disregarded, biological, racism, he, was, a, firm, believer, in, national, traits, and, made, several, generalisations, about, jews, mussolini, blamed, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, on, jewish, vengeance, against, christianity, with, the, remark, race, does, not, betray, race, bolshevism, is, being, defended, by, the, international, plutocracy, that, is, the, real, truth, he, also, made, an, assertion, that, 80, of, soviet, leaders, were, jewish, yet, within, a, few, weeks, he, contradicted, himself, with, the, remark, bolshevism, is, not, as, people, believe, a, jewish, phenomenon, the, truth, is, that, bolshevism, is, leading, to, the, utter, ruin, of, the, jews, of, eastern, europe, in, the, early, 1920s, mussolini, stated, that, fascism, would, never, raise, a, jewish, question, and, in, an, article, he, wrote, he, stated, italy, knows, no, antisemitism, and, we, believe, that, it, will, never, know, it, and, then, elaborated, let, us, hope, that, italian, jews, will, continue, to, be, sensible, enough, so, as, not, to, give, rise, to, antisemitism, in, the, only, country, where, it, has, never, existed, in, 1932, mussolini, during, a, conversation, with, emil, ludwig, described, antisemitism, as, a, german, vice, and, stated, that, there, was, no, jewish, question, in, italy, and, could, not, be, one, in, a, country, with, a, healthy, system, of, government, on, several, occasions, mussolini, spoke, positively, about, jews, and, the, zionist, movement, although, fascism, remained, suspicious, of, zionism, after, the, fascist, party, gained, power, in, 1934, mussolini, supported, the, establishment, of, the, betar, naval, academy, in, civitavecchia, to, train, zionist, cadets, arguing, that, a, jewish, state, would, be, in, italy, s, interest, until, 1938, mussolini, had, denied, any, antisemitism, within, the, fascist, party, the, relationship, between, mussolini, and, adolf, hitler, was, a, contentious, one, early, on, while, hitler, cited, mussolini, as, an, influence, and, privately, expressed, great, admiration, for, him, mussolini, had, little, regard, for, hitler, especially, after, the, nazis, had, his, friend, and, ally, engelbert, dollfuss, the, austrofascist, dictator, of, austria, killed, in, 1934, with, the, assassination, of, dollfuss, mussolini, attempted, to, distance, himself, from, hitler, by, rejecting, much, of, the, racialism, particularly, nordicism, and, antisemitism, espoused, by, the, nazis, mussolini, during, this, period, rejected, biological, racism, at, least, in, the, nazi, sense, and, instead, emphasised, italianising, the, parts, of, the, italian, empire, he, had, desired, to, build, he, declared, that, the, ideas, of, eugenics, and, the, racially, charged, concept, of, an, aryan, nation, were, not, possible, mussolini, dismissed, the, idea, of, a, master, race, as, arrant, nonsense, stupid, and, idiotic, when, discussing, the, nazi, decree, that, the, german, people, must, carry, a, passport, with, either, aryan, or, jewish, racial, affiliation, marked, on, it, in, 1934, mussolini, wondered, how,

theorists, ah, well, we, respond, a, germanic, race, does, not, exist, various, movements, curiosity, stupor, we, repeat, does, not, exist, we, don, t, say, so, scientists, say, so, hitler, says, so, when, german, jewish, journalist, emil, ludwig, asked, about, his, views, on, race, in, 1933, mussolini, exclaimed, race, it, is, a, feeling, not, a, reality, ninety, five, percent, at, least, is, a, feeling, nothing, will, ever, make, me, believe, that, biologically, pure, races, can, be, shown, to, exist, today, amusingly, enough, not, one, of, those, who, have, proclaimed, the, nobility, of, the, teutonic, race, was, himself, a, teuton, gobineau, was, a, frenchman, houston, stewart, chamberlain, an, englishman, woltmann, a, jew, lapouge, another, frenchman, in, a, speech, given, in, bari, in, 1934, he, reiterated, his, attitude, towards, the, german, ideology, of, master, race, thirty, centuries, of, history, allow, us, to, look, with, supreme, pity, on, certain, doctrines, which, are, preached, beyond, the, alps, by, the, descendants, of, those, who, were, illiterate, when, rome, had, caesar, virgil, and, augustus, though, italian, fascism, varied, its, official, positions, on, race, from, the, 1920s, to, 1934, ideologically, italian, fascism, did, not, originally, discriminate, against, the, italian, jewish, community, mussolini, recognised, that, a, small, contingent, had, lived, there, since, the, days, of, the, kings, of, rome, and, should, remain, undisturbed, there, were, even, some, jews, in, the, national, fascist, party, such, as, ettore, ovazza, who, in, 1935, founded, the, jewish, fascist, paper, la, nostra, bandiera, our, flag, by, mid, 1938, the, enormous, influence, hitler, now, had, over, mussolini, became, clear, with, the, introduction, of, the, manifesto, of, race, the, manifesto, which, was, closely, modelled, on, the, nazi, nuremberg, laws, stripped, jews, of, their, italian, citizenship, and, with, it, any, position, in, the, government, or, professions, the, racial, laws, declared, italians, to, be, part, of, the, aryan, race, and, forbade, sexual, relations, and, marriages, between, italians, and, those, considered, to, be, of, an, inferior, race, chiefly, jews, and, africans, jews, were, not, permitted, to, own, or, manage, companies, involved, in, military, production, or, factories, that, employed, over, one, hundred, people, or, exceeded, a, certain, value, they, could, not, own, land, over, a, certain, value, serve, in, the, armed, forces, employ, non, jewish, domestics, or, belong, to, the, fascist, party, their, employment, in, banks, insurance, companies, and, public, schools, was, forbidden, while, many, historians, have, explained, mussolini, s, introduction, of, the, manifesto, of, race, as, being, purely, a, pragmatic, move, to, gain, favour, with, italy, s, new, ally, others, have, challenged, that, viewpoint, and, pointed, out, that, mussolini, along, with, other, fascist, officials, had, encouraged, antisemitic, sentiment, well, before, 1938, such, as, in, response, to, significant, jewish, participation, in, giustizia, e, libert, a, highly, prominent, anti, fascist, organisation, proponents, of, this, viewpoint, argue, that, mussolini, s, implementation, of, these, laws, reflected, a, homegrown, italian, flavour, of, antisemitism, distinct, from, that, of, nazism, one, which, perceived, jews, as, being, bound, to, decadence, and, liberalism, and, was, influenced, not, just, by, fascist, ideology, but, also, by, the, catholic, church, even, after, the, introduction, of, the, racial, laws, mussolini, continued, to, make, contradictory, statements, about, race, many, high, government, officials, told, jewish, representatives, that, the, antisemitism, in, fascist, italy, would, soon, be, over, antisemitism, was, unpopular, within, the, fascist, party, once, when, a, fascist, scholar, protested, to, mussolini, about, the, treatment, of, his, jewish, friends, mussolini, is, reported, to, have, said, i, agree, with, you, entirely, i, don, t, believe, a, bit, in, the, stupid, antisemitic, theory, i, am, carrying, out, my, policy, entirely, for, political, reasons, hitler, was, disappointed, with, mussolini, s, perceived, lack, of, antisemitism, as, was, joseph, goebbels, who, once, said, that, mussolini, appears, to, have, not, recognized, the, jewish, question, nazi, racial, theorist, alfred, rosenberg, criticised, fascist, italy, for, its, lack, of, what, he, defined, as, a, true, concept, of, race, and, jewishness, while, the, virulently, racist, julius, streicher, writing, for, the, unofficial, nazi, propaganda, newspaper, der, st, rmer, dismissed, mussolini, as, a, jewish, puppet, and, lackey, mussolini, and, the, italian, army, in, occupied, regions, openly, opposed, german, efforts, to, deport, italian, jews, to, nazi, concentration, camps, italy, s, refusal, to, comply, with, german, demands, of, jewish, persecution, influenced, other, countries, in, september, 1943, semi, autonomous, militarised, squads, of, fascist, fanatics, sprouted, up, throughout, the, republic, of, sal, these, squads, spread, terror, among, jews, and, partisans, for, a, year, and, a, half, in, the, power, vacuum, that, existed, during, the, first, three, or, four, months, of, the, occupation, the, semi, autonomous, bands, were, virtually, uncontrollable, many, were, linked, to, individual, high, ranking, fascist, politicians, italian, fascists, sometimes, government, employees, but, more, often, fanatic, civilians, or, paramilitary, volunteers, hastened, to, curry, favour, with, the, nazis, informers, betrayed, their, neighbours, squadristi, seized, jews, and, delivered, them, to, the, german, ss, and, italian, journalists, seemed, to, compete, in, the, virulence, of, their, anti, semitic, diatribes, it, has, been, widely, speculated, that, mussolini, adopted, the, manifesto, of, race, in, 1938, for, merely, tactical, reasons, to, strengthen, italy, s, relations, with, germany, mussolini, and, the, italian, military, did, not, consistently, apply, the, laws, adopted, in, the, manifesto, of, race, in, december, 1943, mussolini, made, a, confession, to, journalist, politician, bruno, spampanato, that, seems, to, indicate, that, he, regretted, the, manifesto, of, race, the, racial, manifesto, could,

with, the, sword, of, islam, while, fascist, propaganda, pronounced, him, as, the, protector, of, islam, despite, mussolini, s, ostensible, disbelief, in, biological, racism, fascist, italy, implemented, numerous, laws, rooted, in, such, notions, throughout, its, colonial, empire, on, his, orders, as, well, as, those, of, lower, ranking, fascist, officials, following, the, second, italo,

strict, racial, segregation, between, black, africans, and, italians, in, italian, east, africa, these, racist, laws, were, much, more, rigorous, and, pervasive, than, those, in, other, european, colonies, comparable, in, scope, and, scale, to, those, of, south, africa, during, the, apartheid, era, fascist, italy, s, segregationism, further, differed, from, that, of, other, european, colonies, in, that, its, impetus, came, not, from, within, its, colonies, as, was, usually, the, case, but, from, metropolitan, italy, specifically, from, mussolini, himself, though, many, of, these, laws, were, ignored, by, local, officials, due, to, the, difficulty, of, properly, enforcing, them, mussolini, frequently, complained, to, subordinates, upon, hearing, of, instances, of, them, being,
