the, montgolfier, brothers, joseph, michel, montgolfier, french, 26, august, 1740, 26, june, 1810, and, jacques, tienne, montgolfier, 6, january, 1745, 2, august, 1799, were, aviation, pioneers, balloonists, and, paper, manufacturers, from, the, commune, annonay, in, ard, che, france, they, invented, the, montgolfi, re, style, hot, air, balloon, globe, a, rostatique, which, launched, the, first, confirmed, piloted, ascent, by, humans, in, 1783, carrying, jacques, tienne, joseph, michel, also, invented, the, self, acting, hydraulic, ram, 1796, and, jacques, tienne, founded, the, first, paper, making, vocational, school, together, the, brothers, invented, a, process, to, manufacture, transparent, paper, joseph, michel, and, jacques, tienne, montgolfier, were, born, into, a, family, of, paper, manufacturers, their, parents, were, pierre, montgolfier, 1700, 1793, and, anne, duret, 1701, 1760, who, had, 16, children, pierre, montgolfier, established, his, eldest, son, raymond, 1730, 1772, as, his, successor, joseph, michel, was, the, 12th, child, described, as, a, maverick, and, dreamer, he, was, impractical, in, terms, of, business, and, personal, affairs, tienne, was, the, 15th, child, had, a, much, more, even, and, businesslike, temperament, and, was, sent, to, paris, to, train, as, an, architect, after, the, sudden, and, unexpected, death, of, raymond, in, 1772, he, was, recalled, to, annonay, to, run, the, family, business, in, the, subsequent, 10, years, tienne, applied, his, talent, for, technical, innovation, to, the, family, business, of, paper, making, which, then, as, now, was, a, high, tech, industry, he, succeeded, in, incorporating, the, latest, dutch, innovations, of, the, day, into, the, family, mills, of, the, two, brothers, it, was, joseph, who, was, first, interested, in, aeronautics, as, early, as, 1775, he, built, parachutes, and, once, jumped, from, the, family, house, he, first, contemplated, building, machines, when, he, observed, laundry, drying, over, a, fire, incidentally, form, pockets, that, billowed, upwards, joseph, made, his, first, definitive, experiments, in, november, 1782, while, living, in, avignon, he, reported, some, years, later, that, he, was, watching, a, fire, one, evening, while, contemplating, one, of, the, great, military, issues, of, the, day, an, assault, on, the, fortress, of, gibraltar, which, had, proved, impregnable, from, both, sea, and, land, joseph, mused, on, the, possibility, of, an, air, assault, using, troops, lifted, by, the, same, force, that, was, lifting, the, embers, from, the, fire, he, believed, that, the, smoke, itself, was, the, buoyant, part, and, contained, within, it, a, special, gas, which, he, called, montgolfier, gas, with, a, special, property, he, called, levity, which, is, why, he, preferred, smoldering, fuel, joseph, then, built, a, box, like, chamber, 0, 9, by, 0, 9, by, 1, 2, metres, 3, ft, 3, ft, 4, ft, out, of, very, thin, wood, and, covered, the, sides, and, top, with, lightweight, taffeta, cloth, he, crumpled, and, lit, some, paper, under, the, bottom, of, the, box, the, contraption, quickly, lifted, off, its, stand, and, collided, with, the, ceiling, joseph, recruited, his, brother, to, balloon, building, by, writing, get, in, a, supply, of, taffeta, and, of, cordage, quickly, and, you, will, see, one, of, the, most, astonishing, sights, in, the, world, the, two, brothers, built, a, similar, device, three, times, larger, having, a, volume, 27, times, greater, on, 14, december, 1782, they, took, their, very, first, test, flight, using, ignited, wool, and, hay, as, fuel, the, lifting, force, was, so, great, that, they, lost, control, of, their, craft, the, device, floated, nearly, two, kilometers, 1, 2, mi, but, was, destroyed, after, landing, by, the, indiscretion, of, a, bypasser, to, make, a, public, demonstration, and, to, claim, its, invention, the, brothers, constructed, a, globe, shaped, balloon, of, sackcloth, tightened, with, three, thin, layers, of, paper, inside, the, envelope, could, contain, nearly, 790, m, 3, 28, 000, cu, ft, of, air, and, weighed, 225, kg, 496, lb, it, was, constructed, of, four, pieces, the, dome, and, three, lateral, bands, and, held, together, by, 1, 800, buttons, a, reinforcing, fish, net, of, cord, covered, the, outside, of, the, envelope, on, 4, june, 1783, they, flew, the, balloon, at, annonay, in, front, of, a, group, of, dignitaries, from, the, tats, particuliers, the, flight, covered, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, lasted, 10, minutes, and, had, an, estimated, altitude, of, 1, 600, 2, 000, m, 5, 200, 6, 600, ft, word, of, their, success, quickly, reached, paris, tienne, went, to, the, capital, to, make, further, demonstrations, and, to, solidify, the, brothers, claim, to, the, invention, of, flight, joseph, given, his, unkempt, appearance, and, shyness, remained, with, the, family, tienne, was, the, epitome, of, sober, virtues, modest, in, clothes, and, manner, in, collaboration, with, the, wallpaper, manufacturer, jean, baptiste, r, veillon, tienne, constructed, a, 37, 500, cubic, foot, 1, 060, m, 3, envelope, of, taffeta, coated, with, a, varnish, of, alum, for, fireproofing, the, balloon, was, sky, blue, and, decorated, with, golden, flourishes, signs, of, the, zodiac, and, suns, the, design, showed, the, intervention, of, r, veillon, the, next, test, was, on, 11, september, from, the, grounds, of, la, folie, titon, close, to, r, veillon, s, house, there, was, some, concern, about, the, effects, of, flight, into, the, upper, atmosphere, on, living, creatures, the, king, proposed, to, launch, two, convicted, criminals, but, it, is, most, likely, that, the, inventors, decided, to, send, a, sheep, a, duck, and, a, rooster, aloft, first, on, 19, september, 1783, the, a, rostat, r, veillon, was, flown, with, the, first, living, beings, in, a, basket, attached, to, the, balloon, a, sheep, called, montauciel, climb, to, the, sky, a, duck, and, a, rooster, the, sheep, was, believed, to, have, a, reasonable, approximation, of, human, physiology, the, duck, was, expected, to, be, unharmed, by, being, lifted, and, was, included, as, a, control, for, effects, created, by, the, aircraft, rather, than, the, altitude, the, rooster, was, included, as, a, further, control, as, it, was, a, bird, that, did, not, fly, at, high, altitudes, the, demonstration, was, performed, at, the, royal, palace, in, versailles, before, king, louis, xvi, of, france, and, queen, marie, antoinette, and, a, crowd, the, flight, lasted, approximately, eight, minutes, covered, two, miles, 3, 2, km, and, obtained, an, altitude, of, about, 1, 500, feet, 460, m, the, craft, landed, safely, after, flying, since, the, animals, survived, the, king, allowed, flights, with, humans, again, in, collaboration, with, r, veillon, tienne, built, a, 60, 000, cubic, foot, 1, 700, m, 3, balloon, for, the, purpose, of, making, flights, with, humans, it, was, about, 23, m, 75, ft, tall, and, about, 15, m, 49, ft, in, diameter, r, veillon, supplied, rich, decorative, touches, of, gold, figures, on, a, deep, blue, background, including, fleur, de, lis, signs, of, the, zodiac, and, suns, with, louis, xvi, s, face, in, the, center, interlaced, with, the, royal, monogram, in, the, central, section, red, and, blue, drapery, and, golden, eagles, were, at, the, base, of, the, balloon, tienne, montgolfier, was, the, first, human, to, lift, off, the, earth, in, a, balloon, making, a, tethered, test, flight, from, the, yard, of, the, r, veillon, workshop, in, the, faubourg, saint, antoine, most, likely, on, 15, october, 1783, a, little, while, later, on, that, same, day, physicist, pil, tre, de, rozier, became, the, second, to, ascend, into, the, air, to, an, altitude, of, 80, feet, 24, m, which, was, the, length, of, the, tether, on, 21, november, 1783, the, first, free, flight, by, humans, was, made, by, pil, tre, de, rozier, together, with, an, army, officer, the, marquis, d, arlandes, the, flight, began, from, the, grounds, of, the, ch, teau, de, la, muette, close, to, the, bois, de, boulogne, park, in, the, western, outskirts, of, paris, they, flew, about, 3, 000, feet, 910, m, above, paris, for, a, distance, of, nine, kilometers, after, 25, minutes, the, balloon, landed, between, the, windmills, outside, the, city, ramparts, on, the, butte, aux, cailles, enough, fuel, remained, on, board, at, the, end, of, the, flight, to, have, allowed, the, balloon, to, fly, four, to, five, times, as, far, however, burning, embers, from, the, fire, were, scorching, the, balloon, fabric, and, had, to, be, daubed, out, with, sponges, as, it, appeared, it, could, destroy, the, balloon, pil, tre, took, off, his, coat, to, stop, the, fire, the, early, flights, made, a, sensation, during, those, first, few, years, numerous, items, such, as, fans, furniture, handkerchiefs, pencil, boxes, umbrella, tops, etc, could, be, found, with, ballooning, images, engraved, on, them, some, items, would, be, celebrating, specific, ballooning, events, while, others, would, be, celebrating, ballooning, itself, in, december, 1783, father, pierre, montgolfier, was, elevated, to, the, nobility, and, the, hereditary, appellation, of, de, montgolfier, by, king, louis, xvi, of, france, some, claim, that, the, hot, air, balloon, was, invented, about, 74, years, earlier, by, the, brazilian, portuguese, priest, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, a, description, of, his, invention, was, published, in, 1709, in, vienna, and, another, one, was, found, in, the, vatican, in, about, 1917, however, this, claim, is, not, generally, recognized, by, aviation, historians, outside, the, portuguese, speaking, community, in, particular, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, on, 1, december, 1783, a, few, months, after, the, montgolfiers, first, flight, jacques, alexandre, c, sar, charles, rose, to, an, altitude, of, about, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, near, paris, in, a, hydrogen, filled, balloon, he, had, developed, in, early, 1784, the, flesselles, balloon, named, after, the, unfortunate, jacques, de, flesselles, later, to, be, an, early, casualty, at, the, bastille, gave, a, rough, landing, to, its, passengers, in, june, 1784, the, gustave, a, hot, air, balloon, christened, la, gustave, in, honour, of, king, gustav, iii, of, sweden, s, visit, to, lyon, saw, the, first, female, aeronaut, lisabeth, thible, both, brothers, invented, a, process, to, manufacture, transparent, paper, similar, to, vellum, imitating, the, technique, of, the, english, followed, by, the, papermakers, johannot, and, r, veillon, in, 1796, joseph, michel, montgolfier, invented, the, first, self, acting, hydraulic, ram, a, water, pump, to, raise, water, for, his, paper, mill, at, voiron, in, 1772, the, british, clockmaker, john, whitehurst, had, invented, its, precursor, the, pulsation, engine, in, 1797, montgolfier, s, friend, matthew, boulton, took, out, a, british, patent, on, his, behalf, in, 1816, joseph, michel, s, sons, obtained, a, british, patent, for, an, improved, version, of, the, pump, both, brothers, were, freemasons, in, les, neuf, soeurs, lodge, in, paris, in, 1799, etienne, de, montgolfier, died, on, the, way, from, lyon, to, annonay, his, son, in, law, barth, l, my, barou, de, la, lombardi, re, de, canson, 1774, 1859, succeeded, him, as, the, head, of, the, company, thanks, to, his, marriage, with, alexandrine, de, montgolfier, the, company, became, montgolfier, et, canson, in, 1801, then, canson, montgolfier, in, 1807, in, 1810, joseph, michel, died, in, balaruc, les, bains, the, montgolfier, company, in, annonay, still, exists, under, the, name, canson, it, produces, fine, art, papers, school, drawing, papers, and, digital, fine, art, and, photography, papers, sold, in, 150, countries, in, 1983, the, montgolfier, brothers, were, inducted, into, the, international, air, space, hall, of, fame, at, the, san, diego, air, space, museum
