carl, gustav, jung, j, yuung, german, 26, july, 1875, 6, june, 1961, was, a, swiss, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and, psychologist, who, founded, the, school, of, analytical, psychology, he, was, a, prolific, author, illustrator, and, correspondent, and, a, complex, and, controversial, character, perhaps, best, known, through, his, autobiography, memories, dreams, reflections, jung, s, work, has, been, influential, in, the, fields, of, psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology, and, religious, studies, he, worked, as, a, research, scientist, at, the, burgh, lzli, psychiatric, hospital, in, zurich, under, eugen, bleuler, jung, established, himself, as, an, influential, mind, developing, a, friendship, with, sigmund, freud, founder, of, psychoanalysis, conducting, a, lengthy, correspondence, paramount, to, their, joint, vision, of, human, psychology, jung, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, psychologists, in, history, freud, saw, the, younger, jung, not, only, as, the, heir, he, had, been, seeking, to, take, forward, his, new, science, of, psychoanalysis, but, as, a, means, to, legitimize, his, own, work, freud, and, other, contemporary, psychoanalysts, were, jews, facing, rising, antisemitism, in, europe, and, jung, was, christian, freud, secured, jung, s, appointment, as, president, of, freud, s, newly, founded, international, psychoanalytical, association, jung, s, research, and, personal, vision, however, made, it, difficult, to, follow, his, older, colleague, s, doctrine, and, they, parted, ways, this, division, was, painful, for, jung, and, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, jung, s, analytical, psychology, as, a, comprehensive, system, separate, from, psychoanalysis, scholar, yosef, hayim, yerushalmi, believed, jung, s, later, antisemitic, remarks, may, be, a, clue, to, the, schism, among, the, central, concepts, of, analytical, psychology, is, individuation, the, lifelong, psychological, process, of, differentiation, of, the, self, out, of, each, individual, s, conscious, and, unconscious, elements, jung, considered, it, to, be, the, main, task, of, human, development, he, created, some, of, the, best, known, psychological, concepts, including, synchronicity, archetypal, phenomena, the, collective, unconscious, the, psychological, complex, and, extraversion, and, introversion, his, belief, that, some, alcoholics, may, recover, if, they, have, a, spiritual, or, religious, experience, led, in, part, to, the, founding, of, alcoholics, anonymous, jung, was, an, artist, craftsman, builder, and, prolific, writer, many, of, his, works, were, not, published, until, after, his, death, and, some, remain, unpublished, carl, gustav, jung, was, born, 26, july, 1875, in, kesswil, in, the, swiss, canton, of, thurgau, as, the, first, surviving, son, of, paul, achilles, jung, 1842, 1896, and, emilie, preiswerk, 1848, 1923, his, birth, was, preceded, by, two, stillbirths, and, that, of, a, son, named, paul, born, in, 1873, who, survived, only, a, few, days, paul, jung, carl, s, father, was, the, youngest, son, of, noted, german, swiss, professor, of, medicine, at, basel, karl, gustav, jung, 1794, 1864, paul, s, hopes, of, achieving, a, fortune, never, materialised, and, he, did, not, progress, beyond, the, status, of, an, impoverished, rural, pastor, in, the, swiss, reformed, church, emilie, preiswerk, carl, s, mother, had, also, grown, up, in, a, large, family, whose, swiss, roots, went, back, five, centuries, emilie, was, the, youngest, child, of, a, distinguished, basel, churchman, and, academic, samuel, preiswerk, 1799, 1871, and, his, second, wife, samuel, preiswerk, was, an, antistes, the, title, given, to, the, head, of, the, reformed, clergy, in, the, city, as, well, as, a, hebraist, author, and, editor, who, taught, paul, jung, as, his, professor, of, hebrew, at, basel, university, 17, 19, jung, s, father, was, appointed, to, a, more, prosperous, parish, in, laufen, when, jung, was, six, months, old, tensions, between, father, and, mother, had, developed, jung, s, mother, was, an, eccentric, and, depressed, woman, she, spent, considerable, time, in, her, bedroom, where, she, said, spirits, visited, her, at, night, though, she, was, normal, during, the, day, jung, recalled, that, at, night, his, mother, became, strange, and, mysterious, he, said, that, one, night, he, saw, a, faintly, luminous, and, indefinite, figure, coming, from, her, room, with, a, head, detached, from, the, neck, and, floating, in, the, air, in, front, of, the, body, jung, had, a, better, relationship, with, his, father, jung, s, mother, left, laufen, for, several, months, of, hospitalization, near, basel, for, an, unknown, physical, ailment, his, father, took, carl, to, be, cared, for, by, emilie, jung, s, unmarried, sister, in, basel, but, he, was, later, brought, back, to, his, father, s, residence, emilie, jung, s, continuing, bouts, of, absence, and, depression, deeply, troubled, her, son, and, caused, him, to, associate, women, with, innate, unreliability, whereas, father, meant, for, him, reliability, but, also, powerlessness, in, his, memoir, jung, would, remark, that, this, parental, influence, was, the, handicap, i, started, off, with, later, these, early, impressions, were, revised, i, have, trusted, men, friends, and, been, disappointed, by, them, and, i, have, mistrusted, women, and, was, not, disappointed, after, three, years, of, living, in, laufen, paul, jung, requested, a, transfer, in, 1879, he, was, called, to, kleinh, ningen, next, to, basel, where, his, family, lived, in, a, parsonage, of, the, church, the, relocation, brought, emilie, jung, closer, into, contact, with, her, family, and, lifted, her, melancholy, when, he, was, 9, jung, s, sister, johanna, gertrud, 1884, 1935, was, born, known, in, the, family, as, trudi, she, became, a, secretary, to, her, brother, 349, jung, was, a, solitary, and, introverted, child, from, childhood, he, believed, that, like, his, mother, he, had, two, personalities, a, modern, swiss, citizen, and, a, personality, more, suited, to, the, 18th, century, personality, number, 1, as, he, termed, it, was, a, typical, schoolboy, living, in, the, era, of, the, time, personality, number, 2, was, a, dignified, authoritative, and, influential, man, from, the, past, though, jung, was, close, to, both, parents, he, was, disappointed, by, his, father, s, academic, approach, to, faith, some, childhood, memories, made, lifelong, impressions, on, him, as, a, boy, he, carved, a, tiny, mannequin, into, the, end, of, the, wooden, ruler, from, his, pencil, case, and, placed, it, inside, the, case, he, added, a, stone, which, he, had, painted, into, upper, and, lower, halves, and, hid, the, case, in, the, attic, periodically, he, would, return, to, the, mannequin, often, bringing, tiny, sheets, of, paper, with, messages, inscribed, on, them, in, his, own, secret, language, he, later, reflected, that, this, ceremonial, act, brought, him, a, feeling, of, inner, peace, and, security, years, later, he, discovered, similarities, between, his, personal, experience, and, the, practices, associated, with, totems, in, indigenous, cultures, such, as, the, collection, of, soul, stones, near, arlesheim, or, the, tjurungas, of, australia, he, concluded, that, his, intuitive, ceremonial, act, was, an, unconscious, ritual, which, he, had, practiced, in, a, way, that, was, strikingly, similar, to, those, in, distant, locations, which, he, as, a, young, boy, knew, nothing, about, his, observations, about, symbols, archetypes, and, the, collective, unconscious, were, inspired, in, part, by, these, early, experiences, combined, with, his, later, research, at, the, age, of, 12, shortly, before, the, end, of, his, first, year, at, the, humanistisches, gymnasium, in, basel, jung, was, pushed, to, the, ground, by, another, boy, so, hard, he, momentarily, lost, consciousness, jung, later, recognized, the, incident, was, indirectly, his, fault, a, thought, then, came, to, him, now, you, won, t, have, to, go, to, school, anymore, from, then, on, whenever, he, walked, to, school, or, began, homework, he, fainted, he, remained, at, home, for, the, next, six, months, until, he, overheard, his, father, speaking, hurriedly, to, a, visitor, about, the, boy, s, future, ability, to, support, himself, they, suspected, he, had, epilepsy, confronted, with, the, reality, of, his, family, s, poverty, he, realized, the, need, for, academic, excellence, he, went, into, his, father, s, study, and, began, poring, over, latin, grammar, he, fainted, three, more, times, but, eventually, overcame, the, urge, and, did, not, faint, again, this, event, jung, later, recalled, was, when, i, learned, what, a, neurosis, is, initially, jung, had, aspirations, of, becoming, a, preacher, or, minister, there, was, a, strong, moral, sense, in, his, household, and, several, of, his, family, were, clergymen, jung, had, wanted, to, study, archaeology, but, his, family, could, not, afford, to, send, him, further, than, the, university, of, basel, which, did, not, teach, it, after, studying, philosophy, in, his, teens, jung, decided, against, the, path, of, religious, traditionalism, and, decided, to, pursue, psychiatry, and, medicine, his, interest, was, captured, it, combined, the, biological, and, spiritual, exactly, what, he, was, searching, for, in, 1895, jung, began, to, study, medicine, at, the, university, of, basel, barely, a, year, later, his, father, paul, died, and, left, the, family, near, destitute, they, were, helped, by, relatives, who, also, contributed, to, jung, s, studies, during, his, student, days, he, entertained, his, contemporaries, with, the, family, legend, that, his, paternal, grandfather, was, the, illegitimate, son, of, goethe, and, his, german, great, grandmother, sophie, ziegler, in, later, life, he, pulled, back, from, this, tale, saying, only, that, sophie, was, a, friend, of, goethe, s, niece, in, 1900, jung, moved, to, z, rich, and, began, working, at, the, burgh, lzli, psychiatric, hospital, under, eugen, bleuler, bleuler, was, already, in, communication, with, the, austrian, neurologist, sigmund, freud, jung, s, dissertation, published, in, 1903, was, titled, on, the, psychology, and, pathology, of, so, called, occult, phenomena, it, was, based, on, the, analysis, of, the, supposed, mediumship, of, jung, s, cousin, h, l, ne, preiswerk, under, the, influence, of, freud, s, contemporary, th, odore, flournoy, jung, studied, with, pierre, janet, in, paris, in, 1902, and, later, equated, his, view, of, the, complex, with, janet, s, id, e, fixe, subconsciente, in, 1905, jung, was, appointed, as, a, permanent, senior, doctor, at, the, hospital, and, became, a, lecturer, privatdozent, in, the, medical, faculty, of, zurich, university, in, 1904, he, published, with, franz, riklin, their, diagnostic, association, studies, of, which, freud, obtained, a, copy, in, 1909, jung, left, the, psychiatric, hospital, and, began, a, private, practice, in, his, home, in, k, snacht, eventually, a, close, friendship, and, strong, professional, association, developed, between, the, elder, freud, and, jung, which, left, a, sizeable, correspondence, in, late, summer, 1909, the, two, sailed, for, the, u, s, where, freud, was, the, featured, lecturer, at, the, twentieth, anniversary, celebration, of, the, founding, of, clark, university, in, worcester, massachusetts, the, vicennial, conference, on, psychology, and, pedagogy, september, 7, 11, jung, spoke, as, well, and, received, an, honorary, degree, it, was, during, this, trip, that, jung, first, began, separating, psychologically, from, freud, his, mentor, which, occurred, after, intense, communications, around, their, individual, dreams, and, it, was, during, this, visit, that, jung, was, introduced, to, the, elder, philosopher, and, psychologist, william, james, known, as, the, father, of, american, psychology, whose, ideas, jung, would, incorporate, into, his, own, work, jung, connected, with, james, around, their, mutual, interests, in, mysticism, spiritualism, and, psychical, phenomena, james, wrote, to, a, friend, after, the, conference, stating, jung, left, a, favorable, impression, while, his, views, of, freud, were, mixed, james, died, about, eleven, months, later, the, ideas, of, both, jung, and, james, on, topics, including, hopelessness, self, surrender, and, spiritual, experiences, were, influential, in, the, development, and, founding, of, the, international, altruistic, self, help, movement, alcoholics, anonymous, on, june, 10, 1935, in, akron, ohio, a, quarter, of, a, century, after, james, death, and, in, jung, s, sixtieth, year, for, six, years, jung, and, freud, cooperated, in, their, work, in, 1912, however, jung, published, psychology, of, the, unconscious, which, made, manifest, the, developing, theoretical, divergence, between, the, two, consequently, their, personal, and, professional, relationship, fractured, each, stating, the, other, was, unable, to, admit, he, could, be, wrong, after, the, culminating, break, in, 1913, jung, went, through, a, difficult, and, pivotal, psychological, transformation, exacerbated, by, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, henri, ellenberger, called, jung, s, intense, experience, a, creative, illness, and, compared, it, favorably, to, freud, s, own, period, of, what, he, called, neurasthenia, and, hysteria, 173, in, 1903, jung, married, emma, rauschenbach, 1882, 1955, seven, years, his, junior, and, the, elder, daughter, of, a, wealthy, industrialist, in, eastern, switzerland, johannes, rauschenbach, schenck, rauschenbach, was, the, owner, among, other, concerns, of, iwc, schaffhausen, the, international, watch, company, manufacturer, of, luxury, time, pieces, upon, his, death, in, 1905, his, two, daughters, and, their, husbands, became, owners, of, the, business, jung, s, brother, in, law, ernst, homberger, became, the, principal, proprietor, but, the, jungs, remained, shareholders, in, a, thriving, business, that, ensured, the, family, s, financial, security, for, decades, emma, jung, whose, education, had, been, limited, evinced, considerable, ability, and, interest, in, her, husband, s, research, and, threw, herself, into, studies, and, acted, as, his, assistant, at, burgh, lzli, she, eventually, became, a, noted, psychoanalyst, in, her, own, right, the, marriage, lasted, until, emma, died, in, 1955, they, had, five, children, none, of, the, children, continued, their, father, s, career, the, daughters, agathe, and, marianne, assisted, in, publishing, work, during, his, marriage, jung, engaged, in, at, least, one, extramarital, relationship, his, affair, with, his, patient, and, later, fellow, psychoanalyst, sabina, spielrein, a, continuing, affair, with, toni, wolff, is, also, alleged, jung, and, freud, influenced, each, other, during, the, intellectually, formative, years, of, jung, s, life, jung, had, become, interested, in, psychiatry, as, a, student, by, reading, psychopathia, sexualis, by, richard, von, krafft, ebing, in, 1900, jung, completed, his, degree, and, started, work, as, an, intern, voluntary, doctor, under, the, psychiatrist, eugen, bleuler, at, burgh, lzli, hospital, it, was, bleuler, who, introduced, him, to, the, writings, of, freud, by, asking, him, to, write, a, review, of, the, interpretation, of, dreams, 1899, in, the, early, 1900s, psychology, as, a, science, was, still, in, its, early, stages, but, jung, became, a, qualified, proponent, of, freud, s, new, psycho, analysis, freud, needed, collaborators, and, pupils, to, validate, and, spread, his, ideas, burgh, lzli, was, a, renowned, psychiatric, clinic, in, zurich, and, jung, s, research, had, already, gained, him, international, recognition, jung, sent, freud, a, copy, of, his, studies, in, word, association, in, 1906, the, same, year, he, published, diagnostic, association, studies, a, copy, of, which, he, later, sent, to, freud, who, had, already, purchased, a, copy, preceded, by, a, lively, correspondence, jung, met, freud, for, the, first, time, in, vienna, on, 3, march, 1907, jung, recalled, the, discussion, between, himself, and, freud, as, interminable, unceasing, for, 13, hours, six, months, later, the, then, 50, year, old, freud, sent, a, collection, of, his, latest, published, essays, to, jung, in, zurich, this, marked, the, beginning, of, an, intense, correspondence, and, collaboration, that, lasted, six, years, in, 1908, jung, became, an, editor, of, the, newly, founded, yearbook, for, psychoanalytical, and, psychopathological, research, in, 1909, jung, travelled, with, freud, and, hungarian, psychoanalyst, s, ndor, ferenczi, to, the, united, states, in, september, they, took, part, in, a, conference, at, clark, university, in, worcester, massachusetts, the, conference, at, clark, university, was, planned, by, the, psychologist, g, stanley, hall, and, included, 27, distinguished, psychiatrists, neurologists, and, psychologists, it, represented, a, watershed, in, the, acceptance, of, psychoanalysis, in, north, america, this, forged, welcome, links, between, jung, and, influential, americans, jung, returned, to, the, united, states, the, next, year, for, a, brief, visit, in, 1910, freud, proposed, jung, his, adopted, eldest, son, his, crown, prince, and, successor, for, the, position, of, lifetime, president, of, the, newly, formed, international, psychoanalytical, association, however, after, forceful, objections, from, his, viennese, colleagues, it, was, agreed, jung, would, be, elected, to, serve, a, two, year, term, of, office, while, jung, worked, on, his, psychology, of, the, unconscious, a, study, of, the, transformations, and, symbolisms, of, the, libido, tensions, manifested, between, him, and, freud, because, of, various, disagreements, including, those, concerning, the, nature, of, libido, jung, de, emphasized, the, importance, of, sexual, development, and, focused, on, the, collective, unconscious, the, part, of, the, unconscious, that, contains, memories, and, ideas, that, jung, believed, were, inherited, from, ancestors, while, he, did, think, that, libido, was, an, important, source, for, personal, growth, unlike, freud, jung, did, not, believe, that, libido, alone, was, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, core, personality, in, 1912, these, tensions, came, to, a, peak, because, jung, felt, severely, slighted, after, freud, visited, his, colleague, ludwig, binswanger, in, kreuzlingen, without, paying, him, a, visit, in, nearby, zurich, an, incident, jung, referred, to, as, the, kreuzlingen, gesture, shortly, thereafter, jung, again, traveled, to, the, us, and, gave, the, fordham, university, lectures, a, six, week, series, which, were, published, later, in, the, year, as, psychology, of, the, unconscious, subsequently, republished, as, symbols, of, transformation, while, they, contain, remarks, on, jung, s, dissenting, view, on, the, libido, they, represent, largely, a, psychoanalytical, jung, and, not, the, theory, of, analytical, psychology, for, which, he, became, famous, in, the, following, decades, nonetheless, it, was, their, publication, which, jung, declared, cost, me, my, friendship, with, freud, another, disagreement, with, freud, stemmed, from, their, differing, concepts, of, the, unconscious, jung, saw, freud, s, theory, of, the, unconscious, as, incomplete, and, unnecessarily, negative, and, inelastic, according, to, jung, freud, conceived, the, unconscious, solely, as, a, repository, of, repressed, emotions, and, desires, jung, s, observations, overlap, to, an, extent, with, freud, s, model, of, the, unconscious, what, jung, called, the, personal, unconscious, but, his, hypothesis, is, more, about, a, process, than, a, static, model, and, he, also, proposed, the, existence, of, a, second, overarching, form, of, the, unconscious, beyond, the, personal, that, he, named, the, psychoid, a, term, borrowed, from, neo, vitalist, philosopher, and, embryologist, hans, driesch, 1867, 1941, but, with, a, somewhat, altered, meaning, the, collective, unconscious, is, not, so, much, a, geographical, location, but, a, deduction, from, the, alleged, ubiquity, of, archetypes, over, space, and, time, in, november, 1912, jung, and, freud, met, in, munich, for, a, meeting, among, prominent, colleagues, to, discuss, psychoanalytical, journals, at, a, talk, about, a, new, psychoanalytic, essay, on, amenhotep, iv, jung, expressed, his, views, on, how, it, related, to, actual, conflicts, in, the, psychoanalytic, movement, while, jung, spoke, freud, suddenly, fainted, and, jung, carried, him, to, a, couch, jung, and, freud, personally, met, for, the, last, time, in, september, 1913, for, the, fourth, international, psychoanalytical, congress, in, munich, jung, gave, a, talk, on, psychological, types, the, introverted, and, extraverted, type, in, analytical, psychology, it, was, the, publication, of, jung, s, book, the, psychology, of, the, unconscious, in, 1912, that, led, to, the, final, break, with, freud, the, letters, they, exchanged, show, freud, s, refusal, to, consider, jung, s, ideas, this, rejection, caused, what, jung, described, in, his, posthumously, published, autobiography, memories, dreams, reflections, 1962, as, a, resounding, censure, everyone, he, knew, dropped, away, from, him, except, two, of, his, colleagues, after, the, munich, congress, he, was, on, the, verge, of, a, suicidal, psychosis, that, precipitated, his, writing, of, his, red, book, his, seven, volume, personal, diaries, that, were, only, published, partially, and, posthumously, in, 2009, eleven, years, later, in, 2020, they, were, published, in, their, entirety, as, his, black, books, jung, described, his, 1912, book, as, an, attempt, only, partially, successful, to, create, a, wider, setting, for, medical, psychology, and, to, bring, the, whole, of, the, psychic, phenomena, within, its, purview, the, book, was, later, revised, and, retitled, symbols, of, transformation, in, 1952, jung, spoke, at, meetings, of, the, psycho, medical, society, in, london, in, 1913, and, 1914, his, travels, were, soon, interrupted, by, the, war, but, his, ideas, continued, to, receive, attention, in, england, primarily, through, the, efforts, of, constance, long, who, translated, and, published, the, first, english, volume, of, his, collected, writings, in, 1913, at, the, age, of, 38, jung, experienced, a, horrible, confrontation, with, the, unconscious, he, saw, visions, and, heard, voices, he, worried, at, times, that, he, was, menaced, by, a, psychosis, or, was, doing, a, schizophrenia, he, decided, that, it, was, valuable, experience, and, in, private, he, induced, hallucinations, or, in, his, words, a, process, of, active, imagination, he, recorded, everything, he, experienced, in, small, journals, which, jung, referred, to, in, the, singular, as, his, black, book, considering, it, a, single, integral, whole, and, while, among, these, original, journals, some, have, a, brown, cover, the, material, jung, wrote, was, subjected, to, several, edits, hand, written, and, typed, including, another, second, layer, of, text, his, continual, psychological, interpretations, during, the, process, of, editing, around, 1915, jung, commissioned, a, large, red, leather, bound, book, and, began, to, transcribe, his, notes, along, with, painting, working, intermittently, for, sixteen, years, jung, left, no, posthumous, instructions, about, the, final, disposition, of, what, he, called, the, liber, novus, or, red, book, sonu, shamdasani, a, historian, of, psychology, from, london, tried, for, three, years, to, persuade, jung, s, resistant, heirs, to, have, it, published, ulrich, hoerni, jung, s, grandson, who, manages, the, jung, archives, decided, to, publish, it, when, the, necessary, additional, funds, needed, were, raised, through, the, philemon, foundation, up, to, september, 2008, fewer, than, about, two, dozen, people, had, ever, seen, it, in, 2007, two, technicians, for, digitalfusion, working, with, new, york, city, publishers, w, w, norton, company, scanned, the, manuscript, with, a, 10, 200, pixel, scanner, it, was, published, on, 7, october, 2009, in, german, with, a, separate, english, translation, along, with, shamdasani, s, introduction, and, footnotes, at, the, back, of, the, book, according, to, sara, corbett, reviewing, the, text, for, the, new, york, times, the, book, is, bombastic, baroque, and, like, so, much, else, about, carl, jung, a, willful, oddity, synched, with, an, antediluvian, and, mystical, reality, the, rubin, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, displayed, jung, s, red, book, leather, folio, as, well, as, some, of, his, original, black, book, journals, from, 7, october, 2009, to, 15, february, 2010, according, to, them, during, the, period, in, which, he, worked, on, this, book, jung, developed, his, principal, theories, of, archetypes, collective, unconscious, and, the, process, of, individuation, two, thirds, of, the, pages, bear, jung, s, illuminations, and, illustrations, to, the, text, during, world, war, i, jung, was, drafted, as, an, army, doctor, and, soon, made, commandant, of, an, internment, camp, for, british, officers, and, soldiers, the, swiss, were, neutral, and, obliged, to, intern, personnel, from, either, side, of, the, conflict, who, crossed, their, frontier, to, evade, capture, jung, worked, to, improve, the, conditions, of, soldiers, stranded, in, switzerland, and, encouraged, them, to, attend, university, courses, jung, emerged, from, his, period, of, isolation, in, the, late, nineteen, tens, with, the, publication, of, several, journal, articles, followed, in, 1921, with, psychological, types, one, of, his, most, influential, books, there, followed, a, decade, of, active, publication, interspersed, with, overseas, travels, constance, long, arranged, for, jung, to, deliver, a, seminar, in, cornwall, in, 1920, another, seminar, was, held, in, 1923, this, one, organized, by, jung, s, british, prot, g, helton, godwin, baynes, known, as, peter, 1882, 1943, and, another, in, 1925, in, 1935, at, the, invitation, of, his, close, british, friends, and, colleagues, h, g, baynes, e, a, bennet, and, hugh, crichton, miller, jung, gave, a, series, of, lectures, at, the, tavistock, clinic, in, london, later, published, as, part, of, the, collected, works, in, 1938, jung, was, awarded, an, honorary, degree, by, the, university, of, oxford, at, the, tenth, international, medical, congress, for, psychotherapy, held, at, oxford, from, 29, july, to, 2, august, 1938, jung, gave, the, presidential, address, followed, by, a, visit, to, cheshire, to, stay, with, the, bailey, family, at, lawton, mere, in, 1946, jung, agreed, to, become, the, first, honorary, president, of, the, newly, formed, society, of, analytical, psychology, in, london, having, previously, approved, its, training, programme, devised, by, michael, fordham, during, the, period, of, jung, s, collaboration, with, freud, both, visited, the, us, in, 1909, to, lecture, at, clark, university, worcester, massachusetts, where, both, were, awarded, honorary, degrees, in, 1912, jung, gave, a, series, of, lectures, at, fordham, university, new, york, which, were, published, later, in, the, year, as, psychology, of, the, unconscious, jung, made, a, more, extensive, trip, westward, in, the, winter, of, 1924, 5, financed, and, organized, by, fowler, mccormick, and, george, porter, of, particular, value, to, jung, was, a, visit, with, chief, mountain, lake, of, the, taos, pueblo, near, taos, new, mexico, jung, made, another, trip, to, america, in, 1936, receiving, an, honorary, degree, at, harvard, and, giving, lectures, in, new, york, and, new, england, for, his, growing, group, of, american, followers, he, returned, in, 1937, to, deliver, the, terry, lectures, at, yale, university, later, published, as, psychology, and, religion, in, october, 1925, jung, embarked, on, his, most, ambitious, expedition, the, bugishu, psychological, expedition, to, east, africa, he, was, accompanied, by, his, english, friend, peter, baynes, and, an, american, associate, george, beckwith, on, the, voyage, to, africa, they, became, acquainted, with, an, english, woman, named, ruth, bailey, who, joined, their, safari, a, few, weeks, later, the, group, traveled, through, kenya, and, uganda, to, the, slopes, of, mount, elgon, where, jung, hoped, to, increase, his, understanding, of, primitive, psychology, through, conversations, with, the, culturally, isolated, residents, of, that, area, later, he, concluded, that, the, major, insights, he, had, gleaned, had, to, do, with, himself, and, the, european, psychology, in, which, he, had, been, raised, one, of, jung, s, most, famous, proposed, constructs, is, kinship, libido, jung, defined, this, as, an, instinctive, feeling, of, belonging, to, a, particular, group, or, family, and, jung, believed, it, was, vital, to, the, human, experience, and, used, this, as, an, endogamous, aspect, of, the, libido, and, what, lies, amongst, the, family, this, is, similar, to, a, bantu, term, called, ubuntu, that, emphasizes, humanity, and, almost, the, same, meaning, as, kinship, libido, which, is, i, am, because, you, are, in, december, 1937, jung, left, zurich, again, for, an, extensive, tour, of, india, with, fowler, mccormick, in, india, he, felt, himself, under, the, direct, influence, of, a, foreign, culture, for, the, first, time, in, africa, his, conversations, had, been, strictly, limited, by, the, language, barrier, but, in, india, he, was, able, to, converse, extensively, hindu, philosophy, became, an, important, element, in, his, understanding, of, the, role, of, symbolism, and, the, life, of, the, unconscious, though, he, avoided, a, meeting, with, ramana, maharshi, he, described, ramana, as, being, absorbed, in, the, self, during, these, travels, he, visited, the, vedagiriswarar, temple, where, he, had, a, conversation, with, a, local, expert, about, the, symbols, and, sculptures, on, the, gopuram, of, this, temple, he, later, wrote, about, this, conversation, in, his, book, aion, jung, became, seriously, ill, on, this, trip, and, endured, two, weeks, of, delirium, in, a, calcutta, hospital, after, 1938, his, travels, were, confined, to, europe, jung, became, a, full, professor, of, medical, psychology, at, the, university, of, basel, in, 1943, but, resigned, after, a, heart, attack, the, next, year, to, lead, a, more, private, life, in, 1945, he, began, corresponding, with, an, english, roman, catholic, priest, father, victor, white, who, became, a, close, friend, regularly, visiting, the, jungs, at, the, bollingen, estate, jung, became, ill, again, in, 1952, jung, continued, to, publish, books, until, the, end, of, his, life, including, flying, saucers, a, modern, myth, of, things, seen, in, the, skies, 1959, which, analyzed, the, archetypal, meaning, and, possible, psychological, significance, of, the, reported, observations, of, ufos, in, 1961, he, wrote, his, last, work, a, contribution, to, man, and, his, symbols, entitled, approaching, the, unconscious, published, posthumously, in, 1964, jung, died, on, 6, june, 1961, at, k, snacht, after, a, short, illness, 450, he, had, been, beset, by, circulatory, diseases, among, his, principal, distinctions, are, honorary, doctorates, from, in, addition, he, was, jung, s, thought, derived, from, the, classical, education, he, received, at, school, and, from, early, family, influences, which, on, the, maternal, side, were, a, combination, of, reformed, protestant, academic, theology, with, an, interest, in, occult, phenomena, on, his, father, s, side, was, a, dedication, to, academic, discipline, emanating, from, his, grandfather, the, physician, scientist, and, first, basel, professor, of, medicine, karl, gustav, jung, a, one, time, student, activist, and, convert, from, catholicism, to, swiss, reformed, protestantism, family, lore, suggested, there, was, at, least, a, social, connection, to, the, german, polymath, johann, wolfgang, goethe, through, the, latter, s, niece, lotte, kestner, known, as, lottchen, who, was, a, frequent, visitor, in, jung, senior, s, household, carl, jung, the, practicing, clinician, writer, and, founder, of, analytical, psychology, had, through, his, marriage, the, economic, security, to, pursue, interests, in, other, intellectual, topics, of, the, moment, his, early, celebrity, as, a, research, scientist, through, the, word, association, test, led, to, the, start, of, a, prolific, correspondence, and, world, wide, travel, it, opened, academic, as, well, as, social, avenues, supported, by, his, explorations, into, anthropology, quantum, physics, vitalism, eastern, and, western, philosophy, he, delved, into, epistemology, alchemy, astrology, and, sociology, as, well, as, literature, and, the, arts, jung, s, interest, in, philosophy, and, spiritual, subjects, led, many, to, label, him, as, a, mystic, although, his, preference, was, to, be, seen, as, a, man, of, science, jung, unlike, freud, was, deeply, knowledgeable, about, philosophical, concepts, and, sought, links, between, epistemology, and, emergent, theories, of, psychology, within, the, field, of, analytical, psychology, a, brief, survey, of, major, concepts, developed, by, jung, include, alphabetical, since, the, establishment, of, psychoanalytic, theory, the, notion, and, meaning, of, individuals, having, a, personal, unconscious, has, gradually, come, to, be, commonly, accepted, this, was, popularised, by, both, freud, and, jung, whereas, an, individual, s, personal, unconscious, is, made, up, of, thoughts, and, emotions, which, have, at, some, time, been, experienced, or, held, in, mind, but, which, have, been, repressed, or, forgotten, in, contrast, the, collective, unconscious, is, neither, acquired, by, activities, within, an, individual, s, life, nor, a, container, of, things, that, are, thoughts, memories, or, ideas, which, are, capable, of, being, conscious, during, one, s, life, the, contents, of, it, were, never, naturally, known, through, physical, or, cognitive, experience, and, then, forgotten, the, collective, unconscious, consists, of, universal, heritable, elements, common, to, all, humans, distinct, from, other, species, however, this, does, not, necessarily, imply, a, genetic, cause, it, encapsulates, fields, of, evolutionary, biology, history, of, civilization, ethnology, brain, and, nervous, system, development, and, general, psychological, development, considering, its, composition, in, practical, physiological, and, psychological, terms, it, consists, of, pre, existent, forms, the, archetypes, which, can, only, become, conscious, secondarily, and, which, give, definite, form, to, certain, psychic, contents, jung, writes, about, causal, factors, in, personal, psychology, as, stemming, from, influenced, by, an, abstraction, of, the, impersonal, physical, layer, the, common, and, universal, physiology, among, all, humans, jung, considers, that, science, would, hardly, deny, the, existence, and, basic, nature, of, instincts, existing, as, a, whole, set, of, motivating, urges, the, collective, unconscious, acts, as, the, frame, where, science, can, distinguish, individual, motivating, urges, thought, to, be, universal, across, all, individuals, of, the, human, species, while, instincts, are, present, in, all, species, jung, contends, the, hypothesis, of, the, collective, unconscious, is, therefore, no, more, daring, than, to, assume, there, are, instincts, the, archetype, is, a, concept, borrowed, from, anthropology, to, denote, a, process, of, nature, jung, s, definitions, of, archetypes, varied, over, time, and, have, been, the, subject, of, debate, as, to, their, usefulness, archetypal, images, also, referred, to, as, motifs, in, mythology, are, universal, symbols, that, can, mediate, opposites, in, the, psyche, are, often, found, in, religious, art, mythology, and, fairy, tales, across, cultures, jung, saw, archetypes, as, pre, configurations, in, nature, that, give, rise, to, repeating, understandable, describable, experiences, in, addition, the, concept, takes, into, account, the, passage, of, time, and, of, patterns, resulting, from, transformation, archetypes, are, said, to, exist, independently, of, any, current, event, or, its, effect, they, are, said, to, exert, influence, both, across, all, domains, of, experience, and, throughout, the, stages, of, each, individual, s, unique, development, being, in, part, based, on, heritable, physiology, they, are, thought, to, have, existed, since, humans, became, a, differentiated, species, they, have, been, deduced, through, the, development, of, storytelling, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, indicating, repeating, patterns, of, individual, and, group, experience, behaviors, and, effects, across, the, planet, apparently, displaying, common, themes, the, concept, did, not, originate, with, jung, but, with, plato, who, first, conceived, of, primordial, patterns, later, contributions, came, from, adolf, bastian, and, hermann, usener, among, others, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, it, proved, impossible, to, objectively, isolate, and, categorize, the, notion, of, an, archetype, within, a, materialist, frame, according, to, jung, there, are, as, many, archetypes, as, there, are, typical, situations, in, life, and, he, asserted, that, they, have, a, dynamic, mutual, influence, on, one, another, their, alleged, presence, could, be, extracted, from, thousand, year, old, narratives, from, comparative, religion, and, mythology, jung, elaborated, many, archetypes, in, the, archetypes, and, the, collective, unconscious, and, in, aion, researches, into, the, phenomenology, of, the, self, examples, of, archetypes, might, be, the, shadow, the, hero, the, self, anima, animus, mother, father, child, and, trickster, the, shadow, exists, as, part, of, the, unconscious, mind, and, is, composed, of, the, traits, individuals, instinctively, or, consciously, resist, identifying, as, their, own, and, would, rather, ignore, typically, repressed, ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and, shortcomings, much, of, the, shadow, comes, as, a, result, of, an, individual, s, adaptation, to, cultural, norms, and, expectations, thus, this, archetype, not, only, consists, of, all, the, things, deemed, unacceptable, by, society, but, also, those, that, are, not, aligned, with, one, s, own, personal, morals, and, values, jung, argues, that, the, shadow, plays, a, distinctive, role, in, balancing, one, s, overall, psyche, the, counter, balancing, to, consciousness, where, there, is, light, there, must, also, be, shadow, without, a, well, developed, shadow, often, shadow, work, integrating, one, s, shadow, an, individual, can, become, shallow, and, extremely, preoccupied, with, the, opinions, of, others, that, is, a, walking, persona, not, wanting, to, look, at, their, shadows, directly, jung, argues, often, results, in, psychological, projection, individuals, project, imagined, attitudes, onto, others, without, awareness, the, qualities, an, individual, may, hate, or, love, in, another, may, be, manifestly, present, in, the, individual, who, does, not, see, the, external, material, truth, in, order, to, truly, grow, as, an, individual, jung, believed, that, both, the, persona, and, shadow, should, be, balanced, the, shadow, can, appear, in, dreams, or, visions, often, taking, the, form, of, a, dark, wild, exotic, figure, jung, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, define, introversion, and, extraversion, in, a, psychological, context, in, jung, s, psychological, types, he, theorizes, that, each, person, falls, into, one, of, two, categories, the, introvert, or, the, extravert, jung, compares, these, two, psychological, types, to, ancient, archetypes, apollo, and, dionysus, the, introvert, is, likened, to, apollo, who, shines, a, light, on, understanding, the, introvert, is, focused, on, the, internal, world, of, reflection, dreaming, and, vision, thoughtful, and, insightful, the, introvert, can, sometimes, be, uninterested, in, joining, the, activities, of, others, the, extravert, is, associated, with, dionysus, interested, in, joining, the, activities, of, the, world, the, extravert, is, focused, on, the, outside, world, of, objects, sensory, perception, and, action, energetic, and, lively, the, extravert, may, lose, their, sense, of, self, in, the, intoxication, of, dionysian, pursuits, jungian, introversion, and, extraversion, is, quite, different, from, the, modern, idea, of, introversion, and, extraversion, modern, theories, often, stay, true, to, behaviourist, means, of, describing, such, a, trait, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, etc, whereas, jungian, introversion, and, extraversion, are, expressed, as, a, perspective, introverts, interpret, the, world, subjectively, whereas, extraverts, interpret, the, world, objectively, in, his, psychological, theory, which, is, not, necessarily, linked, to, a, particular, theory, of, social, structure, the, persona, appears, as, a, consciously, created, personality, or, identity, fashioned, out, of, part, of, the, collective, psyche, through, socialization, acculturation, and, experience, jung, applied, the, term, persona, explicitly, because, in, latin, it, means, both, personality, and, the, masks, worn, by, roman, actors, of, the, classical, period, expressive, of, the, individual, roles, played, the, persona, he, argues, is, a, mask, for, the, collective, psyche, a, mask, that, pretends, individuality, so, that, both, self, and, others, believe, in, that, identity, even, if, it, is, really, no, more, than, a, well, played, role, through, which, the, collective, psyche, is, expressed, jung, regarded, the, persona, mask, as, a, complicated, system, which, mediates, between, individual, consciousness, and, the, social, community, it, is, a, compromise, between, the, individual, and, society, as, to, what, a, man, should, appear, to, be, but, he, also, makes, it, quite, explicit, that, it, is, in, substance, a, character, mask, in, the, classical, sense, known, to, theatre, with, its, double, function, both, intended, to, make, a, certain, impression, on, others, and, to, hide, part, of, the, true, nature, of, the, individual, the, therapist, then, aims, to, assist, the, individuation, process, through, which, the, client, re, gains, their, own, self, by, liberating, the, self, both, from, the, deceptive, cover, of, the, persona, and, from, the, power, of, unconscious, impulses, jung, has, become, enormously, influential, in, management, theory, not, just, because, managers, and, executives, have, to, create, an, appropriate, management, persona, a, corporate, mask, and, a, persuasive, identity, but, also, because, they, have, to, evaluate, what, sort, of, people, the, workers, are, to, manage, them, for, example, using, personality, tests, and, peer, reviews, jung, s, work, on, himself, and, his, patients, convinced, him, that, life, has, a, spiritual, purpose, beyond, material, goals, the, main, task, for, people, he, believed, is, to, discover, and, fulfill, their, deep, innate, potential, based, on, his, study, of, christianity, hinduism, buddhism, gnosticism, taoism, and, other, traditions, jung, believed, this, journey, of, transformation, which, he, called, individuation, is, at, the, mystical, heart, of, all, religions, it, is, a, journey, to, meet, the, self, and, at, the, same, time, to, meet, the, divine, unlike, freud, s, atheistic, worldview, jung, s, pantheism, may, have, led, him, to, believe, that, spiritual, experience, was, essential, to, well, being, as, he, specifically, identifies, individual, human, life, with, the, universe, as, a, whole, in, 1959, jung, was, asked, by, host, john, freeman, on, the, bbc, interview, program, face, to, face, whether, he, believed, in, god, to, which, jung, answered, i, do, not, need, to, believe, i, know, jung, s, ideas, on, religion, counterbalance, freudian, skepticism, jung, s, idea, of, religion, as, a, practical, road, to, individuation, is, still, treated, in, modern, textbooks, on, the, psychology, of, religion, though, his, ideas, have, been, criticized, jung, recommended, spirituality, as, a, cure, for, alcoholism, and, is, considered, to, have, had, an, indirect, role, in, establishing, alcoholics, anonymous, jung, once, treated, an, american, patient, rowland, hazard, iii, who, had, chronic, alcoholism, after, working, with, the, patient, for, some, time, and, achieving, no, significant, progress, jung, told, the, man, that, his, alcoholic, condition, was, near, to, hopeless, save, only, the, possibility, of, a, spiritual, experience, jung, noted, that, occasionally, such, experiences, had, been, known, to, reform, alcoholics, when, all, other, options, had, failed, hazard, took, jung, s, advice, seriously, and, set, about, seeking, a, personal, spiritual, experience, he, returned, to, the, united, states, and, joined, a, christian, evangelical, movement, known, as, the, oxford, group, he, told, other, alcoholics, what, jung, had, told, him, about, the, importance, of, a, spiritual, experience, one, of, the, alcoholics, he, brought, into, the, oxford, group, was, ebby, thacher, a, long, time, friend, and, drinking, buddy, of, bill, wilson, later, co, founder, of, alcoholics, anonymous, thacher, told, wilson, about, the, oxford, group, and, through, them, wilson, became, aware, of, hazard, s, experience, with, jung, the, influence, of, jung, thus, indirectly, found, its, way, into, the, formation, of, alcoholics, anonymous, the, original, twelve, step, program, the, above, claims, are, documented, in, the, letters, of, jung, and, bill, wilson, though, the, detail, is, disputed, by, some, historians, jung, discussed, an, oxford, group, member, who, may, have, been, the, same, person, in, talks, given, around, 1940, the, remarks, were, distributed, privately, in, transcript, form, from, shorthand, taken, by, an, attender, jung, reportedly, approved, the, transcript, and, later, recorded, in, his, collected, works, for, instance, when, a, member, of, the, oxford, group, comes, to, me, in, order, to, get, treatment, i, say, you, are, in, the, oxford, group, so, long, as, you, are, there, you, settle, your, affair, with, the, oxford, group, i, can, t, do, it, better, than, jesus, jung, goes, on, to, state, he, has, seen, similar, cures, among, roman, catholics, the, 12, step, program, of, alcoholics, anonymous, has, a, psychological, backdrop, involving, the, human, ego, and, dichotomy, between, the, conscious, and, unconscious, mind, jung, had, an, apparent, interest, in, the, paranormal, and, occult, for, decades, he, attended, seances, and, claimed, to, have, witnessed, parapsychic, phenomena, initially, he, attributed, these, to, psychological, causes, even, delivering, a, 1919, lecture, in, england, for, the, society, for, psychical, research, on, the, psychological, foundations, for, the, belief, in, spirits, however, he, began, to, doubt, whether, an, exclusively, psychological, approach, can, do, justice, to, the, phenomena, in, question, and, stated, that, the, spirit, hypothesis, yields, better, results, but, he, retained, some, skepticism, toward, his, own, postulation, as, he, could, not, find, material, evidence, of, the, existence, of, spirits, jung, s, ideas, about, the, paranormal, culminated, in, synchronicity, this, is, the, idea, that, certain, coincidences, manifest, in, the, world, have, exceptionally, intense, meaning, to, observers, such, coincidences, have, great, effect, on, the, observer, from, multiple, cumulative, aspects, from, the, immediate, personal, relevance, of, the, coincidence, to, the, observer, from, the, peculiarities, of, the, nature, of, the, character, novelty, curiosity, of, any, such, coincidence, from, the, sheer, improbability, of, the, coincidence, having, no, apparent, causal, link, hence, jung, s, essay, subtitle, an, acausal, connecting, principle, despite, his, own, experiments, failing, to, confirm, the, phenomenon, he, held, on, to, the, idea, as, an, explanation, for, apparent, esp, in, addition, he, proposed, it, as, a, functional, explanation, for, how, the, i, ching, worked, although, he, was, never, clear, about, how, synchronicity, worked, jung, influenced, one, philosophical, interpretation, not, the, science, of, quantum, physics, with, the, concept, of, synchronicity, regarding, some, events, as, non, causal, that, idea, influenced, the, physicist, wolfgang, pauli, with, whom, via, a, letter, correspondence, jung, developed, the, notion, of, unus, mundus, in, connection, with, the, notion, of, nonlocality, and, some, other, physicists, jung, s, acquaintance, with, alchemy, came, between, 1928, and, 1930, when, he, was, introduced, to, a, manuscript, of, the, secret, of, the, golden, flower, translated, by, richard, wilhelm, the, work, and, writings, of, jung, from, the, 1930s, onwards, shifted, to, a, focus, on, the, psychological, significance, of, alchemy, in, 1944, jung, published, psychology, and, alchemy, in, which, he, analyzed, the, alchemical, symbols, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, them, and, the, psychoanalytical, process, he, argued, that, the, alchemical, process, was, the, transformation, of, the, impure, soul, lead, to, perfected, soul, gold, and, a, metaphor, for, the, individuation, process, in, 1963, mysterium, coniunctionis, first, appeared, in, english, as, part, of, the, collected, works, of, c, g, jung, mysterium, coniunctionis, was, jung, s, last, major, book, and, focused, on, the, mysterium, coniunctionis, archetype, known, as, the, sacred, marriage, between, sun, and, moon, jung, argued, that, the, stages, of, the, alchemists, the, blackening, the, whitening, the, reddening, and, the, yellowing, could, be, taken, as, symbolic, of, individuation, his, chosen, term, for, personal, growth, 75, jung, proposed, that, art, can, be, used, to, alleviate, or, contain, feelings, of, trauma, fear, or, anxiety, and, also, to, repair, restore, and, heal, in, his, work, with, patients, and, his, own, personal, explorations, jung, wrote, that, art, expression, and, images, found, in, dreams, could, help, recover, from, trauma, and, emotional, distress, at, times, of, emotional, distress, he, often, drew, painted, or, made, objects, and, constructions, which, he, recognized, as, more, than, recreational, dance, movement, therapy, as, active, imagination, was, created, by, jung, and, toni, wolff, in, 1916, and, practiced, by, tina, keller, jenny, and, other, analysts, but, remained, largely, unknown, until, the, 1950s, when, it, was, rediscovered, by, marian, chace, and, therapist, mary, whitehouse, whitehouse, after, studying, with, martha, graham, and, mary, wigman, became, a, dancer, and, teacher, of, modern, dance, as, well, as, swiss, dancer, trudy, schoop, in, 1963, who, is, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, dance, movement, therapy, in, the, us, jung, stressed, the, importance, of, individual, rights, in, a, person, s, relation, to, the, state, and, society, he, saw, that, the, state, was, treated, as, a, quasi, animate, personality, from, whom, everything, is, expected, but, that, this, personality, was, only, camouflage, for, those, individuals, who, know, how, to, manipulate, it, and, referred, to, the, state, as, a, form, of, slavery, he, also, thought, that, the, state, swallowed, up, religious, forces, and, therefore, that, the, state, had, taken, the, place, of, god, making, it, comparable, to, a, religion, in, which, state, slavery, is, a, form, of, worship, jung, observed, that, stage, acts, of, state, are, comparable, to, religious, displays, brass, bands, flags, banners, parades, and, monster, demonstrations, are, no, different, in, principle, from, ecclesiastical, processions, cannonades, and, fire, to, scare, off, demons, from, jung, s, perspective, this, replacement, of, god, with, the, state, in, a, mass, society, leads, to, the, dislocation, of, the, religious, drive, and, results, in, the, same, fanaticism, of, the, church, states, of, the, dark, ages, wherein, the, more, the, state, is, worshipped, the, more, freedom, and, morality, are, suppressed, this, ultimately, leaves, the, individual, psychically, undeveloped, with, extreme, feelings, of, marginalization, jung, was, in, contact, with, allen, dulles, of, the, office, of, strategic, services, predecessor, of, the, central, intelligence, agency, and, provided, valuable, intelligence, on, the, psychological, condition, of, hitler, dulles, referred, to, jung, as, agent, 488, and, offered, the, following, description, of, his, service, nobody, will, probably, ever, know, how, much, professor, jung, contributed, to, the, allied, cause, during, the, war, by, seeing, people, who, were, connected, somehow, with, the, other, side, jung, s, service, to, the, allied, cause, through, the, oss, remained, classified, after, the, war, in, the, state, of, psychotherapy, today, published, in, 1934, in, the, zentralblatt, f, r, psychotherapie, jung, wrote, the, aryan, unconscious, has, a, greater, potential, than, the, jewish, unconscious, and, the, jew, who, is, something, of, a, nomad, has, never, yet, created, a, cultural, form, of, his, own, and, as, far, as, we, can, see, never, will, andrew, samuels, argues, that, his, remarks, on, the, aryan, unconscious, and, the, corrosive, character, of, freud, s, jewish, gospel, demonstrate, an, antisemitism, fundamental, to, the, structure, of, jung, s, thought, but, also, argues, that, there, is, a, pioneering, nature, of, jung, s, contributions, and, that, his, intuition, of, the, importance, of, exploring, difference, remains, intact, in, 1933, after, the, nazis, gained, power, in, germany, jung, became, the, president, of, the, new, international, general, medical, society, for, psychotherapy, allgemeine, rztliche, gesellschaft, f, r, psychotherapie, a, professional, body, which, aimed, to, have, affiliated, organizations, in, different, countries, the, german, affiliated, organization, the, deutsche, allgemeine, rztliche, gesellschaft, f, r, psychotherapie, led, by, matthias, g, ring, an, adlerian, psychotherapist, and, a, cousin, of, the, prominent, nazi, hermann, g, ring, excluded, jews, in, 1933, the, society, s, zentralblatt, f, r, psychotherapie, journal, published, a, statement, endorsing, nazi, positions, and, hitler, s, book, mein, kampf, in, 1934, jung, wrote, in, a, swiss, publication, the, neue, z, rcher, zeitung, that, he, experienced, great, surprise, and, disappointment, when, the, zentralblatt, associated, his, name, with, the, pro, nazi, statement, he, did, not, end, his, relationship, with, the, zentralblatt, at, this, time, but, he, did, arrange, the, appointment, of, a, new, managing, editor, carl, alfred, meier, of, switzerland, for, the, next, few, years, the, zentralblatt, under, jung, and, meier, maintained, a, position, distinct, from, that, of, the, nazis, in, that, it, continued, to, acknowledge, contributions, of, jewish, doctors, to, psychotherapy, in, the, face, of, energetic, german, attempts, to, nazify, the, international, body, jung, resigned, from, its, presidency, in, 1939, the, year, the, second, world, war, started, the, international, society, s, constitution, permitted, individual, doctors, to, join, it, directly, rather, than, through, one, of, the, national, affiliated, societies, a, provision, to, which, jung, drew, attention, in, a, circular, in, 1934, this, implied, that, german, jewish, doctors, could, maintain, their, professional, status, as, individual, members, of, the, international, body, even, though, they, were, excluded, from, the, german, affiliate, as, well, as, from, other, german, medical, societies, operating, under, the, nazis, jung, went, on, to, say, the, main, point, is, to, get, a, young, and, insecure, science, into, a, place, of, safety, during, an, earthquake, scholar, yosef, hayim, yerushalmi, believed, that, jung, s, antisemitism, may, have, contributed, to, the, schism, from, freud, and, his, circle, of, psychoanalysts, who, were, predominantly, jews, jung, s, interest, in, european, mythology, and, folk, psychology, was, shared, by, the, nazis, richard, noll, describes, jung, s, own, reaction, to, this, connection, jung, clearly, identifies, himself, with, the, spirit, of, german, volkstumsbewegung, throughout, this, period, and, well, into, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, until, the, horrors, of, nazism, finally, compelled, him, to, reframe, these, neopagan, metaphors, in, a, negative, light, in, his, 1936, essay, on, wotan, various, statements, made, by, jung, in, the, 1930s, have, been, cited, as, evidence, of, both, contempt, for, nazism, and, sympathy, for, nazism, in, the, 1936, essay, wotan, jung, described, the, influence, of, adolf, hitler, on, germany, as, one, man, who, is, obviously, possessed, has, infected, a, whole, nation, to, such, an, extent, that, everything, is, set, in, motion, and, has, started, rolling, on, its, course, towards, perdition, he, would, later, say, during, a, lengthy, interview, with, h, r, knickerbocker, in, october, 1938, hitler, seemed, like, the, double, of, a, real, person, as, if, hitler, the, man, might, be, hiding, inside, like, an, appendix, and, deliberately, so, concealed, in, order, not, to, disturb, the, mechanism, you, know, you, could, never, talk, to, this, man, because, there, is, nobody, there, it, is, not, an, individual, it, is, an, entire, nation, in, an, interview, in, 1949, carl, jung, said, it, must, be, clear, to, anyone, who, has, read, any, of, my, books, that, i, have, never, been, a, nazi, sympathizer, and, i, never, have, been, anti, semitic, and, no, amount, of, misquotation, mistranslation, or, rearrangement, of, what, i, have, written, can, alter, the, record, of, my, true, point, of, view, nearly, every, one, of, these, passages, has, been, tampered, with, either, by, malice, or, by, ignorance, furthermore, my, friendly, relations, with, a, large, group, of, jewish, colleagues, and, patients, over, a, period, of, many, years, in, itself, disproves, the, charge, of, anti, semitism, jung, is, also, known, to, have, possessed, an, interest, in, the, jewish, mystic, tradition, of, kabbalah, jung, addressed, homosexuality, in, his, published, writings, in, one, comment, specifying, that, homosexuality, should, not, be, a, concern, of, legal, authorities, nor, be, considered, a, crime, he, also, stated, that, homosexuality, does, not, reduce, the, value, of, a, person, as, a, member, of, society, jung, also, said, that, homosexuality, is, a, result, of, psychological, immaturity, but, only, if, one, s, sexuality, is, not, an, aspect, of, their, constitutional, characteristics, jung, s, theories, are, considered, to, be, a, useful, therapeutic, framework, for, the, analysis, of, unconscious, phenomena, that, become, manifest, in, the, acute, psychedelic, state, this, view, is, based, on, correspondence, jung, had, with, researchers, involved, in, psychedelic, research, in, the, 1950s, as, well, as, more, recent, neuroimaging, research, where, subjects, who, are, administered, psychedelic, compounds, seem, to, have, archetypal, religious, experiences, of, unity, and, ego, dissolution, associated, with, reduced, activity, in, the, default, mode, network, this, research, has, led, to, a, re, evaluation, of, jung, s, work, and, particularly, the, visions, detailed, in, the, red, book, in, the, context, of, contemporary, psychedelic, evolutionary, and, developmental, neuroscience, for, example, in, a, chapter, entitled, integrating, the, archaic, and, the, modern, the, red, book, visual, cognitive, modalities, and, the, neuroscience, of, altered, states, of, consciousness, in, the, 2020, volume, jung, s, red, book, for, our, time, searching, for, soul, under, postmodern, conditions, volume, 4, it, is, argued, jung, was, a, pioneer, who, explored, uncharted, cognitive, domains, that, are, alien, to, western, modes, of, thought, while, such, domains, of, experience, are, not, part, of, mainstream, western, culture, and, thought, they, are, central, to, various, indigenous, cultures, who, use, psychedelics, such, as, iboga, and, ayahuasca, during, rituals, to, alter, consciousness, as, the, author, writes, jung, seems, to, have, been, dealing, with, modes, of, consciousness, alien, to, mainstream, western, thought, exploring, the, terrain, of, uncharted, cognitive, domains, i, argue, that, science, is, beginning, to, catch, up, with, jung, who, was, a, pioneer, whose, insights, contribute, a, great, deal, to, our, emerging, understanding, of, human, consciousness, in, this, analysis, jung, s, paintings, of, his, visions, in, the, red, book, were, compared, to, the, paintings, of, ayahuasca, visions, by, the, peruvian, shaman, pablo, amaringo, commenting, on, research, that, was, being, undertaken, during, the, 1950s, jung, wrote, the, following, in, a, letter, to, betty, eisner, a, psychologist, who, was, involved, in, lsd, research, at, the, university, of, california, experiments, along, the, line, of, mescaline, and, related, drugs, are, certainly, most, interesting, since, such, drugs, lay, bare, a, level, of, the, unconscious, that, is, otherwise, accessible, only, under, peculiar, psychic, conditions, it, is, a, fact, that, you, get, certain, perceptions, and, experiences, of, things, appearing, either, in, mystical, states, or, in, the, analysis, of, unconscious, phenomena, an, account, of, jung, and, psychedelics, as, well, as, the, importance, of, jungian, psychology, to, psychedelic, assisted, therapies, is, outlined, in, scott, hill, s, 2013, book, confrontation, with, the, unconscious, jungian, depth, psychology, and, psychedelic, experience, a, 2021, article, discusses, jung, s, attitude, towards, psychedelics, as, well, as, the, applicability, of, his, ideas, to, current, research, as, the, author, writes, jung, s, legitimate, reservations, about, the, clinical, use, of, psychedelics, are, no, longer, relevant, as, the, field, has, progressed, significantly, devising, robust, clinical, and, experimental, protocols, for, psychedelic, assisted, therapies, that, said, jung, s, concept, of, individuation, that, is, the, integration, of, the, archaic, unconscious, with, consciousness, seems, extremely, pertinent, to, modern, psychedelic, research, the, author, also, uses, work, in, evolutionary, and, psychedelic, neuroscience, and, specifically, the, latter, s, ability, to, make, manifest, ancient, subcortical, brain, systems, to, illuminate, jung, s, concept, of, an, archaic, collective, unconscious, that, evolved, prior, to, the, ego, complex, and, the, uniquely, human, default, mode, network, the, myers, briggs, type, indicator, mbti, a, psychometric, instrument, mostly, popular, with, non, psychologists, as, well, as, the, concepts, of, socionics, were, developed, from, jung, s, model, of, psychological, types, the, mbti, is, considered, pseudoscience, and, is, not, widely, accepted, by, researchers, in, the, field, of, psychology, jung, is, considered, a, godparent, of, the, altruistic, mutual, self, help, movement, alcoholics, anonymous, jung, told, rhode, island, businessman, and, politician, rowland, hazard, iii, who, had, come, under, his, care, for, the, first, time, in, 1926, that, the, only, chance, he, might, have, to, recover, was, through, a, spiritual, or, religious, experience, or, genuine, conversion, which, hazard, later, had, through, the, oxford, group, and, the, emmanuel, movement, and, according, to, some, sources, never, drank, again, hazard, in, turn, helped, ebby, thatcher, another, alcoholic, get, sober, with, help, from, the, oxford, group, thatcher, brought, jung, s, ideas, to, a, third, alcoholic, bill, w, who, consequently, cofounded, alcoholics, anonymous, with, dr, bob, years, later, bill, w, corresponded, with, jung, in, 1961, thanking, him, for, helping, to, inspire, the, organization, of, hazard, the, alcoholic, who, came, under, his, care, jung, wrote, his, craving, for, alcohol, was, the, equivalent, on, a, low, level, of, the, spiritual, thirst, of, our, being, for, wholeness, expressed, in, medieval, language, the, union, with, god, jung, concludes, his, letter, to, bill, w, you, see, alcohol, in, latin, is, spiritus, and, you, use, the, same, word, for, the, highest, religious, experience, as, well, as, for, the, most, depraving, poison, the, helpful, formula, therefore, is, spiritus, contra, spiritum, jung, saw, the, human, psyche, as, by, nature, religious, and, made, this, idea, a, principal, focus, of, his, explorations, jung, is, one, of, the, best, known, contemporary, contributors, to, dream, analysis, and, symbolization, his, influence, on, popular, psychology, the, psychologization, of, religion, spirituality, and, the, new, age, movement, has, been, immense, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, jung, as, the, 23rd, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, the, list, however, focused, on, u, s, journals, and, was, made, by, the, psychology, department, of, arkansas, state, university, although, psychoanalysis, is, still, studied, in, the, humanities, a, 2008, study, in, the, journal, of, the, american, psychoanalytic, association, found, that, psychology, departments, and, textbooks, treat,
