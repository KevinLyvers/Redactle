great, man, but, flawed, but, he, died, in, 1976, alas, what, can, one, say, deng, xiaoping, said, i, should, remind, you, that, chairman, mao, dedicated, most, of, his, life, to, china, that, he, saved, the, party, and, the, revolution, in, their, most, critical, moments, that, in, short, his, contribution, was, so, great, that, without, him, the, chinese, people, would, have, had, a, much, harder, time, finding, the, right, path, out, of, the, darkness, we, also, shouldn, t, forget, that, it, was, chairman, mao, who, combined, the, teachings, of, marx, and, lenin, with, the, realities, of, chinese, history, that, it, was, he, who, applied, those, principles, creatively, not, only, to, politics, but, to, philosophy, art, literature, and, military, strategy, philip, short, said, that,

from, the, straitjacket, of, its, confucian, past, but, the, bright, red, future, he, promised, turned, out, to, be, a, sterile, purgatory, alexander, v, pantsov, and, steven, i, levine, in, their, biography, asserted, that, mao, was, both, a, successful, creator, and, ultimately, an, evil, destroyer, but, also, argued, that, he, was, a, complicated, figure, who, should, not, be, lionised, as, a, saint, or, reduced, to, a, demon, as, he, indeed, tried, his, best, to, bring, about, prosperity, and, gain, international, respect, for, his, country, they, also, remarked, on, mao, s, legacy, a,

most, populous, state, resting, on, his, laurels, but, at, the, same, time, an, indefatigable, revolutionary, who, sincerely, attempted, to, refashion, the, way, of, life, and, consciousness, of, millions, of, people, a, hero, of, national, revolution, and, a, bloody, social, reformer, this, is, how, mao, goes, down, in, history, the, scale, of, his, life, was, too, grand, to, be, reduced, to, a, single, meaning, mao, s, english, interpreter, sidney, rittenberg, wrote, in, his, memoir, that, whilst, mao, was, a, great, leader, in, history, he, was, also, a, great, criminal, because, not, that, he, wanted, to, not, that, he, intended, to, but, in, fact, his, wild, fantasies, led, to, the, deaths, of, tens, of, millions, of, people, the, united, states, placed, a, trade, embargo, on,

s, legacy, future, historians, may, conclude, that, mao, s, role, was, to, try, to, destroy, the, age, old, bifurcation, of, china, between, a, small, educated, ruling, stratum, and, the, vast, mass, of, common, people, we, do, not, yet, know, how, far, he, succeeded, the, economy, was, developing, but, it, was, left, to, his, successors, to, create, a, new, political, structure, stuart, r, schram, said, eternal, rebel, refusing, to, be, bound, by, the, laws, of, god, or, man, nature, or, marxism, he, led, his, people, for, three, decades, in, pursuit, of, a, vision, initially, noble, which, turned, increasingly, into, a, mirage, and, then, into, a, nightmare, was, he, a, faust, or, prometheus, attempting, the, impossible, for, the, sake, of, humanity, or, a, despot, of, unbridled, ambition, drunk, with, his, own, power, and, his, own, cleverness, schram, also, said, i, agree, with, the, current, chinese, view, that, mao, s, merits, outweighed, his, faults, but, it, is, not, easy, to, put, a, figure, on, the, positive, and, negative, aspects, how, does, one, weigh, for, example, the, good, fortune, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, peasants, in, getting, land, against, the, execution, in, the, course, of, land, reform, and, the, campaign, against, counter, revolutionaries, or, in, other, contexts, of, millions, some, of, whom, certainly, deserved, to, die, but, others, of, whom, undoubtedly, did, not, how, does, one, balance, the, achievements, in, economic, development, during, the, first, five, year, plan, or, during, the, whole, twenty, seven, years, of, mao, s, leadership, after, 1949, against, the, starvation, which, came, in, the, wake, of, the, misguided, enthusiasm, of, the, great, leap, forward, or, the, bloody, shambles, of, the, cultural, revolution, schram, added, in, the, last, analysis, however, i, am, more, interested, in, the, potential, future, impact, of, his, thought, than, in, sending, mao, as, an, individual, to, heaven, or, to, hell, maurice, meisner, assessed, mao, s, legacy, it, is, the, blots, on, the, maoist, record, especially, the, great, leap, and, the, cultural, revolution, that, are, now, most, deeply, imprinted, on, our, political, and, historical, consciousness, that, these, adventures, were, failures, colossal, in, scope, and, that, they, took, an, enormous, human, toll, cannot, and, should, not, be, forgotten, but, future, historians, without, ignoring, the, failures, and, the, crimes, will, surely, record, the, maoist, era, in, the, history, of, the, people, s, republic, however, else, they, may, judge, it, as, one, of, the, great, modernizing, epochs, in, world, history, and, one, that, brought, great, social, and, human, benefits, to, the, chinese, people, the, ideology, of, maoism, has, influenced, many, communists, mainly, in, the, third, world, including, revolutionary, movements, such, as, cambodia, s, khmer, rouge, peru, s, shining, path, and, the, nepalese, revolutionary, movement, under, the, influence, of, mao, s, agrarian, socialism, and, cultural, revolution, pol, pot, and, the, khmer, rouge, conceived, of, his, disastrous, year, zero, policies, which, purged, the, nation, of, its, teachers, artists, and, intellectuals, and, emptied, its, cities, resulting, in, the, cambodian, genocide, the, revolutionary, communist, party, usa, also, claims, marxism, leninism, maoism, as, its, ideology, as, do, other, communist, parties, around, the, world, which, are, part, of, the, revolutionary, internationalist, movement, china, itself, has, moved, sharply, away, from, maoism, since, mao, s, death, and, most, people, outside, of, china, who, describe, themselves, as, maoist, regard, the, deng, xiaoping, reforms, to, be, a, betrayal, of, maoism, in, line, with, mao, s, view, of, capitalist, roaders, within, the, communist, party, as, the, chinese, government, instituted, market, economic, reforms, starting, in, the, late, 1970s, and, as, later, chinese, leaders, took, power, less, recognition, was, given, to, the, status, of, mao, this, accompanied, a, decline, in, state, recognition, of, mao, in, later, years, in, contrast, to, previous, years, when, the, state, organised, numerous, events, and, seminars, commemorating, mao, s, 100th, birthday, nevertheless, the, chinese, government, has, never, officially, repudiated, the, tactics, of, mao, deng, xiaoping, who, was, opposed, to, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, cultural, revolution, stated, that, when, we, write, about, his, mistakes, we, should, not, exaggerate, for, otherwise, we, shall, be, discrediting, chairman, mao, zedong, and, this, would, mean, discrediting, our, party, and, state, the, july, 1963, limited, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, increased, chinese, concerns, over, a, us,

zone, in, which, china, s, status, as, a, non, white, power, might, enable, it, to, compete, with, and, supersede, both, united, states, and, soviet, union, influence, 48, the, other, intermediate, zone, was, the, usa, s, wealthier, allies, in, europe, 97, mao, s, military, writings, continue, to, have, a, large, amount, of, influence, both, among, those, who, seek, to, create, an, insurgency, and, those, who, seek, to, crush, one, especially, in, manners, of, guerrilla, warfare, at, which, mao, is, popularly, regarded, as, a, genius, the, nepali, maoists, were, highly, influenced, by, mao, s, views, on, protracted, war, new, democracy, support, of, masses, permanency, of, revolution, and, the, great, proletarian, cultural, revolution, mao, s, major, contribution, to, the, military, science, is, his, theory, of, people, s, war, with, not, only, guerrilla, warfare, but, more, importantly, mobile, warfare, methodologies, mao, had, successfully, applied, mobile, warfare, in, the,
