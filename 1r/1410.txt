much, an, english, knowing, upper, class, affair, however, nehru, agreed, to, raise, funds, for, the, ongoing, indian, civil, rights, movement, led, by, mahatma, gandhi, in, south, africa, in, 1916,

league, against, imperialism, which, was, born, at, this, meeting, he, made, a, statement, in, favour, of, complete, independence, for, india, nehru, s, stay, in, europe, included, a, visit, to, the, soviet, union, which, sparked, his, interest, in, marxism, and, socialism, appealed, by, its, ideas, but, repelled, by, some, of, its, tactics, he, never, completely, agreed, with, karl, marx, s, ideas, however, from, that, time, on, the, benchmark, of, his, economic, view, remained, marxist, adapted, where, necessary, to, indian, circumstances, after, returning, to, india, in, december, 1927, nehru, was, elected, to, another, two, year, term, as, congress, general, secretary, nehru, was, one, of, the, first, leaders, to, demand, that, the, congress, party, should, resolve, to, make, a, complete, and, explicit, break, from, all, ties, with, the, british, empire, the, madras, session, of, congress, in, 1927, approved, his, resolution, for, independence, despite, gandhi, s, criticism, at, that, time, he, formed, the, independence, for, india, league, a, pressure, group, within, the, congress, in, 1928, gandhi, agreed, to, nehru, s, demands, and, proposed, a, resolution, that, called, for, the, british, to, grant, dominion, status, to, india, within, two, years, if, the, british, failed, to, meet, the, deadline, the, congress, would, call, upon, all, indians, to, fight, for, complete, independence, nehru, was, one, of, the, leaders, who, objected, to, the, time, given, to, the, british, he, pressed, gandhi, to, demand, immediate, actions, from, the, british, gandhi, brokered, a, further, compromise, by, reducing, the, time, given, from, two, years, to, one, the, british, rejected, demands, for, dominion, status, in, 1929, nehru, assumed, the, presidency, of, the, congress, party, during, the, lahore, session, on, 29, december, 1929, and, introduced, a, successful, resolution, calling, for, complete, independence, nehru, drafted, the, indian, declaration, of, independence, which, stated, we, believe, that, it, is, the, inalienable, right, of, the, indian, people, as, of, any, other, people, to, have, freedom, and, to, enjoy, the, fruits, of, their, toil, and, have, the, necessities, of, life, so, that, they, may, have, full, opportunities, for, growth, we, believe, also, that, if, any, government, deprives, a, people, of, these, rights, and, oppresses, them, the, people, have, a, further, right, to, alter, it, or, abolish, it, the, british, government, in, india, has, not, only, deprived, the, indian, people, of, their, freedom, but, has, based, itself, on, the, exploitation, of, the, masses, and, has, ruined, india, economically, politically, culturally, and, spiritually, we, believe, therefore, that, india, must, sever, the, british, connection, and, attain, purna, swaraj, or, complete, independence, at, midnight, on, new, year, s, eve, 1929, nehru, hoisted, the, tricolour, flag, of, india, upon, the, banks, of, the, ravi, in, lahore, a, pledge, of, independence, was, read, out, which, included, a, readiness, to, withhold, taxes, the, massive, gathering, of, the, public, attending, the, ceremony, was, asked, if, they, agreed, with, it, and, the, majority, of, people, were, witnessed, raising, their, hands, in, approval, 172, indian, members, of, central, and, provincial, legislatures, resigned, in, support, of, the, resolution, and, in, accordance, with, indian, public, sentiment, the, congress, asked, the, people, of, india, to, observe, 26, january, as, independence, day, congress, volunteers, nationalists, and, the, public, hoisted, the, flag, of, india, publicly, across, india, plans, for, mass, civil, disobedience, were, also, underway, after, the, lahore, session, of, the, congress, in, 1929, nehru, gradually, emerged, as, the, paramount, leader, of, the, indian, independence, movement, gandhi, stepped, back, into, a, more, spiritual, role, although, gandhi, did, not, explicitly, designate, nehru, as, his, political, heir, until, 1942, as, early, as, the, mid, 1930s, the, country, saw, nehru, as, the, natural, successor, to, gandhi, in, 1929, nehru, had, already, drafted, the, fundamental, rights, and, economic, policy, resolution, that, set, the, government, agenda, for, an, independent, india, the, resolution, was, ratified, in, 1931, at, the, karachi, session, chaired, by, vallabhbhai, patel, nehru, and, most, of, the, congress, leaders, were, ambivalent, initially, about, gandhi, s, plan, to, begin, civil, disobedience, with, a, satyagraha, aimed, at, the, british, salt, tax, after, the, protest, had, gathered, steam, they, realised, the, power, of, salt, as, a, symbol, nehru, remarked, about, the, unprecedented, popular, response, it, seemed, as, though, a, spring, had, been, suddenly, released, he, was, arrested, on, 14, april, 1930, while, on, a, train, from, allahabad, to, raipur, earlier, after, addressing, a, huge, meeting, and, leading, a, vast, procession, he, had, ceremoniously, manufactured, some, contraband, salt, he, was, charged, with, breach, of, the, salt, law, and, sentenced, to, six, months, of, imprisonment, at, central, jail, he, nominated, gandhi, to, succeed, him, as, the, congress, president, during, his, absence, in, jail, but, gandhi, declined, and, nehru, nominated, his, father, as, his, successor, with, nehru, s, arrest, the, civil, disobedience, acquired, a, new, tempo, and, arrests, firing, on, crowds, and, lathi, charges, grew, to, be, ordinary, occurrences, the, salt, satyagraha, pressure, for, reform, through, passive, resistance, succeeded, in, attracting, world, attention, indian, british, and, world, opinion, increasingly, recognised, the, legitimacy, of, the, claims, by, the, congress, party, for, independence, nehru, considered, the, salt, satyagraha, the, high, water, mark, of, his, association, with, gandhi, and, felt, its, lasting, importance, was, in, changing, the, attitudes, of, indians, of, course, these, movements, exercised, tremendous, pressure, on, the, british, government, and, shook, the, government, machinery, but, the, real, importance, to, my, mind, lay, in, the, effect, they, had, on, our, own, people, and, especially, the, village, masses, non, cooperation, dragged, them, out, of, the, mire, and, gave, them, self, respect, and, self, reliance, they, acted, courageously, and, did, not, submit, so, easily, to, unjust, oppression, their, outlook, widened, and, they, began, to, think, a, little, in, terms, of, india, as, a, whole, it, was, a, remarkable, transformation, and, the, congress, under, gandhi, s, leadership, must, have, the, credit, for, it, on, 11, october, 1930, nehru, s, detention, ended, but, he, was, back, in, jail, in, less, than, ten, days, for, resuming, the, presidency, of, the, banned, congress, on, 26, january, 1931, nehru, and, other, prisoners, were, released, early, by, lord, irwin, who, was, negotiating, with, gandhi, his, father, died, on, 6, february, 1931, nehru, was, back, in, jail, on, 26, december, 1931, after, violating, court, orders, not, to, leave, allahabad, while, leading, a, no, rent, campaign, to, alleviate, peasant, distress, on, 30, august, 1933, nehru, was, released, from, prison, but, the, government, soon, moved, to, detain, him, again, on, 22, december, 1933, the, home, secretary, sent, a, memo, to, all, local, governments, in, india, the, government, of, india, regard, him, as, by, far, the, most, dangerous, element, at, large, in, india, and, their, view, is, that, the, time, has, come, in, accordance, with, their, general, policy, of, taking, steps, at, an, early, stage, to, prevent, attempts, to, work, up, mass, agitation, to, take, action, against, him, he, was, arrested, in, allahabad, on, 12, january, 1934, in, august, 1934, he, was, briefly, released, for, eleven, days, to, attend, to, his, wife, s, ailing, health, in, october, he, was, allowed, to, see, her, again,

switzerland, where, she, died, on, 28, february, 1936, while, in, europe, nehru, learned, that, he, was, elected, as, congress, president, for, the, coming, year, he, returned, to, india, in, march, 1936, and, led, the, congress, response, to, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, he, condemned, the, act, as, a, new, charter, of, bondage, and, a, machine, with, strong, brakes, but, no, engine, he, initially, wanted, to, boycott, the, 1937, provincial, elections, but, agreed, to, lead, the, election, campaign, after, receiving, vague, assurances, about, abstentionism, from, the, party, leaders, who, wished, to, contest, nehru, hoped, to, treat, the, election, campaign, as, a, mass, outreach, programme, during, the, campaign, nehru, was, elected, to, another, term, as, congress, president, the, election, manifesto, drafted, largely, by, nehru, attacked, both, the, act, and, the, communal, award, that, went, with, it, he, campaigned, against, the, muslim, league, and, argued, that, muslims, could, not, be, regarded, as, a, separate, nation, the, congress, won, most, general, seats, and, the, muslim, league, fared, poorly, with, muslim, electorates, after, the, elections, nehru, drafted, a, resolution, against, taking, office, but, there, were, many, congress, leaders, who, wanted, to, assume, power, under, the, 1935, act, the, congress, working, committee, cwc, under, gandhi, passed, a, compromise, resolution, that, authorised, office, acceptance, but, reiterated, that, the, fundamental, objective, of, the, congress, was, the, destruction, of, the, 1935, act, nehru, was, more, popular, than, before, with, the, public, but, he, found, himself, isolated, at, the, cwc, meetings, due, to, the, anti, socialist, orientation, of, its, membership, gandhi, had, to, personally, intervene, when, a, group, of, cwc, members, and, nehru, threatened, to, resign, and, counter, resign, their, posts, over, disagreements, he, became, discontented, with, his, role, especially, after, the, death, of, his, mother, in, january, 1938, in, february, 1938, he, did, not, stand, for, re, election, as, president, and, was, succeeded, by, subash, chandra, bose, he, left, for, europe, in, june, stopping, on, the, way, at, alexandria, egypt, while, in, europe, nehru, became, very, concerned, with, the, possibility, of, another, world, war, at, that, time, he, emphasised, that, in, the, event, of, war, india, s, place, was, alongside, the, democracies, though, he, insisted, india, could, only, fight, in, support, of, great, britain, and, france, as, a, free, country, after, returning, to, india, in, december, 1938, nehru, accepted, bose, s, offer, to, head, the, planning, commission, in, february, 1939, he, became, president, of, the, all, india,

presidency, and, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, mediate, when, world, war, ii, began, viceroy, linlithgow, unilaterally, declared, india, a, belligerent, on, the, side, of, britain, without, consulting, the, elected, indian, representatives, nehru, hurried, back, from, a, visit, to, china, announcing, that, in, a, conflict, between, democracy, and, fascism, our, sympathies, must, inevitably, be, on, the, side, of, democracy, i, should, like, india, to, play, its, full, part, and, throw, all, her, resources, into, the, struggle, for, a, new, order, after, much, deliberation, the, congress, under, nehru, informed, the, government, that, it, would, co, operate, with, the, british, but, on, certain, conditions, first, britain, must, give, an, assurance, of, full, independence, for, india, after, the, war, and, allow, the, election, of, a, constituent, assembly, to, frame, a, new, constitution, second, although, the, indian, armed, forces, would, remain, under, the, british, commander, in, chief, indians, must, be, included, immediately, in, the, central, government, and, given, a, chance, to, share, power, and, responsibility, when, nehru, presented, lord, linlithgow, with, these, demands, he, chose, to, reject, them, a, deadlock, was, reached, the, same, old, game, is, played, again, nehru, wrote, bitterly, to, gandhi, the, background, is, the, same, the, various, epithets, are, the, same, and, the, actors, are, the, same, and, the, results, must, be, the, same, on, 23, october, 1939, the, congress, condemned, the, viceroy, s, attitude, and, called, upon, the, congress, ministries, in, the, various, provinces, to, resign, in, protest, before, this, crucial, announcement, nehru, urged, jinnah, and, the, muslim, league, to, join, the, protest, but, jinnah, declined, in, march, 1940, muhammad, ali, jinnah, passed, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, pakistan, resolution, declaring, that, muslims, are, a, nation, according, to, any, definition, of, a, nation, and, they, must, have, their, homelands, their, territory, and, their, state, this, state, was, to, be, known, as, pakistan, meaning, land, of, the, pure, nehru, angrily, declared, that, all, the, old, problems, pale, into, insignificance, before, the, latest, stand, taken, by, the, muslim, league, leader, in, lahore, linlithgow, made, nehru, an, offer, on, 8, october, 1940, which, stated, that, dominion, status, for, india, was, the, objective, of, the, british, government, however, it, referred, neither, to, a, date, nor, a, method, to, accomplish, this, only, jinnah, received, something, more, precise, the, british, would, not, contemplate, transferring, power, to, a, congress, dominated, national, government, the, authority, of, which, was, denied, by, various, elements, in, india, s, national, life, in, october, 1940, gandhi, and, nehru, abandoning, their, original, stand, of, supporting, britain, decided, to, launch, a, limited, civil, disobedience, campaign, in, which, leading, advocates, of, indian, independence, were, selected, to, participate, one, by, one, nehru, was, arrested, and, sentenced, to, four, years, imprisonment, on, 15, january, 1941, gandhi, stated, some, say, jawaharlal, and, i, were, estranged, it, will, require, much, more, than, a, difference, of, opinion, to, estrange, us, we, had, differences, from, the, time, we, became, co, workers, and, yet, i, have, said, for, some, years, and, say, so, now, that, not, rajaji, but, jawaharlal, will, be, my, successor, after, spending, a, little, more, than, a, year, in, jail, nehru, was, released, along, with, other, congress, prisoners, three, days, before, the, bombing, of, pearl, harbor, in, hawaii, when, the, japanese, carried, their, attack, through, burma, now, myanmar, to, the, borders, of, india, in, the, spring, of, 1942, the, british, government, faced, with, this, new, military, threat, decided, to, make, some, overtures, to, india, as, nehru, had, originally, desired, prime, minister, winston, churchill, dispatched, sir, stafford, cripps, a, member, of, the, war, cabinet, who, was, known, to, be, politically, close, to, nehru, and, knew, jinnah, with, proposals, for, a, settlement, of, the, constitutional, problem, as, soon, as, he, arrived, he, discovered, that, india, was, more, deeply, divided, than, he, had, imagined, nehru, eager, for, a, compromise, was, hopeful, gandhi, was, not, jinnah, had, continued, opposing, the, congress, pakistan, is, our, only, demand, and, by, god, we, will, have, it, he, declared, in, the, muslim, league, newspaper, dawn, cripps, mission, failed, as, gandhi, would, accept, nothing, less, than, independence, relations, between, nehru, and, gandhi, cooled, over, the, latter, s, refusal, to, co, operate, with, cripps, but, the, two, later, reconciled, in, 1942, gandhi, called, on, the, british, to, leave, india, nehru, though, reluctant, to, embarrass, the, allied, war, effort, had, no, alternative, but, to, join, gandhi, following, the, quit, india, resolution, passed, by, the, congress, party, in, bombay, on, 8, august, 1942, the, entire, congress, working, committee, including, gandhi, and, nehru, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, most, of, the, congress, working, committee, including, nehru, abdul, kalam, azad, and, sardar, patel, were, incarcerated, at, the, ahmednagar, fort, until, 15, june, 1945, during, the, period, when, all, the, congress, leaders, were, in, jail, the, muslim, league, under, jinnah, grew, in, power, in, april, 1943, the, league, captured, the, governments, of, bengal, and, a, month, later, that, of, the, north, west, frontier, province, in, none, of, these, provinces, had, the, league, previously, had, a, majority, only, the, arrest, of, congress, members, made, it, possible, with, all, the, muslim, dominated, provinces, except, punjab, under, jinnah, s, control, the, concept, of, a, separate, muslim, state, was, turning, into, a, reality, however, by, 1944, jinnah, s, power, and, prestige, were, waning, a, general, sympathy, towards, the, jailed, congress, leaders, was, developing, among, muslims, and, much, of, the, blame, for, the, disastrous, bengal, famine, of, 1943, 44, during, which, two, million, died, had, been, laid, on, the, shoulders, of, the, province, s, muslim, league, government, the, numbers, at, jinnah, s, meetings, once, counted, in, thousands, soon, numbered, only, a, few, hundred, in, despair, jinnah, left, the, political, scene, for, a, stay, in, kashmir, his, prestige, was, restored, unwittingly, by, gandhi, who, had, been, released, from, prison, on, medical, grounds, in, may, 1944, and, had, met, jinnah, in, bombay, in, september, there, he, offered, the, muslim, leader, a, plebiscite, in, the, muslim, areas, after, the, war, to, see, whether, they, wanted, to, separate, from, the, rest, of, india, essentially, it, was, an, acceptance, of, the, principle, of, pakistan, but, not, in, so, many, words, jinnah, demanded, that, the, exact, words, be, used, gandhi, refused, and, the, talks, broke, down, jinnah, however, had, greatly, strengthened, his, own, position, and, that, of, the, league, the, most, influential, member, of, the, congress, had, been, seen, to, negotiate, with, him, on, equal, terms, nehru, and, his, colleagues, were, released, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, british, 1946, cabinet, mission, to, india, to, propose, plans, for, the, transfer, of, power, the, agreed, plan, in, 1946, led, to, elections, to, the, provincial, assemblies, in,

as, the, interim, prime, minister, then, from, 1947, as, the, prime, minister, of, the, dominion, of, india, and, then, from, 1950, as, the, prime, minister, of, the, republic, of, india, jawaharlal, nehru, showed, his, concern, for, the, princely, states, of, south, asia, since, 1920s, during, his, presidential, address, at, the, lahore, session, in, 1929, nehru, had, declared, that, the, indian, states, cannot, live, apart, from, the, rest, of, india, and, their, rulers, must, unless, they, accept, their, inevitable, limitations, go, the, way, of, others, like, them, in, july, 1946, nehru, pointedly, observed, that, no, princely, state, could, prevail, militarily, against, the, army, of, independent, india, in, january, 1947, he, said, that, independent, india, would, not, accept, the, divine, right, of, kings, in, may, 1947, he, declared, that, any, princely, state, which, refused, to, join, the, constituent, assembly, would, be, treated, as, an, enemy, state, vallabhbhai, patel, and, v, p, menon, were, more, conciliatory, towards, the, princes, and, as, the, men, charged, with, integrating, the, states, were, successful, in, the, task, during, the, drafting, of, the, indian, constitution, many, indian, leaders, except, nehru, were, in, favour, of, allowing, each, princely, state, or, covenanting, state, to, be, independent, as, a, federal, state, along, the, lines, suggested, originally, by, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, but, as, the, drafting, of, the, constitution, progressed, and, the, idea, of, forming, a, republic, took, concrete, shape, it, was, decided, that, all, the, princely, states, covenanting, states, would, merge, with, the, indian, republic, in, 1963, nehru, brought, in, legislation, making, it, illegal, to, demand, secession, and, introduced, the, sixteenth, amendment, to, the, constitution, which, makes, it, necessary, for, those, running, for, office, to, take, an, oath, that, says, i, will, uphold, the, sovereignty, and, integrity, of, india, the, period, before, independence, in, early, 1947, was, impaired, by, outbreaks, of, communal, violence, and, political, disorder, and, the, opposition, of, the, muslim, league, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, who, were, demanding, a, separate, muslim, state, of, pakistan, he, took, office, as, the, prime, minister, of, india, on, 15, august, and, delivered, his, inaugural, address, titled, tryst, with, destiny, long, years, ago, we, made, a, tryst, with, destiny, and, now, the, time, comes, when, we, shall, redeem, our, pledge, not, wholly, or, in, full, measure, but, very, substantially, at, the, stroke, of, the, midnight, hour, when, the, world, sleeps, india, will, awake, to, life, and, freedom, a, moment, comes, which, comes, but, rarely, in, history, when, we, step, out, from, the, old, to, the, new, when, an, age, ends, and, when, the, soul, of, a, nation, long, suppressed, finds, utterance, it, is, fitting, that, at, this, solemn, moment, we, take, the, pledge, of, dedication, to, the, service, of, india, and, her, people, and, to, the, still, larger, cause, of, humanity, on, 30, january, 1948, gandhi, was, shot, while, he, was, walking, in, the, garden, of, birla, house, on, his, way, to, address, a, prayer, meeting, the, assassin, nathuram, godse, was, a, hindu, nationalist, with, links, to, the, extremist, hindu, mahasabha, party, who,

no, more, perhaps, i, am, wrong, to, say, that, nevertheless, we, will, not, see, him, again, as, we, have, seen, him, for, these, many, years, we, will, not, run, to, him, for, advice, or, seek, solace, from, him, and, that, is, a, terrible, blow, not, only, for, me, but, for, millions, and, millions, in, this, country, yasmin, khan, argued, that, gandhi, s, death, and, funeral, helped,

parties, during, the, transition, to, independence, for, the, indian, people, in, later, years, there, emerged, a, revisionist, school, of, history, which, sought, to, blame, nehru, for, the, partition, of, india, mostly, referring, to, his, highly, centralised, policies, for, an, independent, india, in, 1947, which, jinnah, opposed, in, favour, of, a, more, decentralised, india, the, british, indian, empire, which, included, present, day, india, pakistan, and, bangladesh, was, divided, into, two, types, of, territories, the, provinces, of, british, india, which, were, governed, directly, by, british, officials, responsible, to, the, viceroy, of, india, and, princely, states, under, the, rule, of, local, hereditary, rulers, who, recognised, british, suzerainty, in, return, for, local, autonomy, in, most, cases, as, established, by, a, treaty, between, 1947, and, about, 1950, the, territories, of, the, princely, states, were, politically, integrated, into, the, indian, union, under, nehru, and, sardar, patel, most, were, merged, into, existing, provinces, others, were, organised, into, new, provinces, such, as, rajputana, himachal, pradesh, madhya, bharat, and, vindhya, pradesh, made, up, of, multiple, princely, states, a, few, including, mysore, hyderabad, bhopal, and, bilaspur, became, separate, provinces, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, remained,

ultimately, turned, into, the, preamble, to, the, constitution, of, india, the, preamble, is, considered, to, be, the, spirit, of, the, constitution, the, new, constitution, of, india, which, came, into, force, on, 26, january, 1950, republic, day, made, india, a, sovereign, democratic, republic, the, new, republic, was, declared, to, be, a, union, of, states, after, the, adoption, of, the,

it, to, india, it, increased, the, popularity, of, both, in, india, but, he, was, criticised, by, the, communist, opposition, in, india, for, the, use, of, military, force, from, 1959, in, a, process, that, accelerated, in, 1961, nehru, adopted, the, forward, policy, of, setting, up, military, outposts, in, disputed, areas, of, the, sino, indian, border, including, 43, outposts, in, territory, not, previously, controlled, by, india, china, attacked, some, of, these, outposts, and, the, sino, indian, war, began, which, india, lost, the, war, ended, with, china, announcing, a, unilateral,

conciliation, in, the, world, i, believe, that, because, you, are, a, world, leader, for, peace, in, your, individual, capacity, as, well, as, a, representative, of, the, largest, neutral, nation, in, 1955, churchill, called, nehru, the, light, of, asia, and, a, greater, light, than, gautama, buddha, nehru, is, time, and, again, described, as, a, charismatic, leader, with, a, rare, charm, according, to, bhikhu, parekh, nehru, can, be, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, modern, indian, state, parekh, attributes, this, to, the, national, philosophy, nehru, formulated, for, india, for, him, modernisation, was, the, national, philosophy, with, seven, goals, national, unity, parliamentary, democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development, of, the, scientific, temper, and, non, alignment, in, parekh, s, opinion, the, philosophy, and, the, policies, that, resulted, from, this, benefited, a, large, section, of, society, such, as, public, sector, workers, industrial, houses, and, middle, and, upper, peasantry, however, it, failed, to, benefit, the, urban, and, rural, poor, the, unemployed, and, the, hindu, fundamentalists, nehru, is, credited, with, having, prevented, civil, wars, in, india, nehru, convincingly, succeeded, in, secularism, and, religious, harmony, increasing, the, representation, of, minorities, in, government, nehru, implemented, policies, based, on, import, substitution, industrialisation, and, advocated, a, mixed, economy, where, the, government, controlled, public, sector, would, co, exist, with, the, private, sector, he, believed, the, establishment, of, basic, and, heavy, industry, was, fundamental, to, the, development, and, modernisation, of, the, indian, economy, the, government, therefore, directed, investment, primarily, into, key, public, sector, industries, steel, iron, coal, and, power, promoting, their, development, with, subsidies, and, protectionist, policies, nehru, s, vision, of, an, egalitarian, society, was, a, co, operative, ideal, a, one, world, ideal, based, on, social, justice, and, economic, equality, in, 1928, nehru, had, affirmed, that, our, economic, programme, must, aim, at, the, removal, of, all, economic, inequalities, later, in, 1955, he, declared, that, i, also, want, a, classess, society, in, india, and, the, world, he, identified, his, concept, of, economic, freedom, with, the, country, s, economic, development, and, material, advancement, the, policy, of, non, alignment, during, the, cold, war, meant, that, nehru, received, financial, and, technical, support, from, both, power, blocs, in, building, india, s, industrial, base, from, scratch, steel, mill, complexes, were, built, at, bokaro, and, rourkela, with, assistance, from, the, soviet, union, and, west, germany, there, was, substantial, industrial, development, the, industry, grew, 7, 0, annually, between, 1950, and, 1965, almost, trebling, industrial, output, and, making, india, the, world, s, seventh, largest, industrial, country, nehru, s, critics, however, contended, that, india, s, import, substitution, industrialisation, which, continued, long, after, the, nehru, era, weakened, the, international, competitiveness, of, its, manufacturing, industries, india, s, share, of, world, trade, fell, from, 1, 4, in, 1951, 1960, to, 0, 5, between, 1981, and, 1990, however, india, s, export, performance, is, argued, to, have, shown, actual, sustained, improvement, over, the, period, the, volume, of, exports, grew, at, an, annual, rate, of, 2, 9, in, 1951, 1960, to, 7, 6, in, 1971, 1980, gdp, and, gnp, grew, 3, 9, and, 4, 0, annually, between, 1950, and, 1951, and, 1964, 1965, it, was, a, radical, break, from, the, british, colonial, period, but, the, growth, rates, were, considered, anaemic, at, best, compared, to, other, industrial, powers, in, europe, and, east, asia, india, lagged, behind, the, miracle, economies, japan, west, germany, france, and, italy, however, this, mixed, development,

successful, land, reform, was, introduced, that, abolished, giant, landholdings, but, efforts, to, redistribute, land, by, placing, limits, on, landownership, failed, attempts, to, introduce, large, scale, cooperative, farming, were, frustrated, by, landowning, rural, elites, who, formed, the, core, of, the, powerful, right, wing, of, the, congress, and, had, considerable, political, support, in, opposing, nehru, s, efforts, agricultural, production, expanded, until, the, early, 1960s, as, additional, land, was, brought, under, cultivation, and, some, irrigation, projects, began, to, have, an,

and, increase, crop, production, at, the, same, time, a, series, of, failed, monsoons, would, cause, serious, food, shortages, despite, the, steady, progress, and, an, increase, in, agricultural, production, nehru, was, a, passionate, advocate, of, education, for, india, s, children, and, youth, believing, it, essential, for, india, s, future, progress, his, government, oversaw, the, establishment, of, many, institutions, of, higher, learning, including, the, all, india, institute, of, medical, sciences, the, indian, institutes, of, technology, the, indian, institutes, of, management, and, the, national, institutes, of, technology, nehru, also, outlined, a, commitment, in, his, five, year, plans, to, guarantee, free, and, compulsory, primary, education, to, all, of, india, s, children, for, this, purpose, nehru, oversaw, the, creation, of, mass, village, enrolment, programs, and, the, construction, of, thousands, of, schools, nehru, also, launched, initiatives, such, as, the, provision, of, free, milk, and, meals, to, children, to, fight, malnutrition, adult, education, centres, and, vocational, and, technical, schools, were, also, organised, for, adults, especially, in, the, rural, areas, under, nehru, the, indian, parliament, enacted, many, changes, to, hindu, law, through, the, hindu, code, bills, to, criminalise, caste, discrimination, and, increase, the, legal, rights, and, social, freedoms, of, women, the, nehru, administration, saw, such, codification, as, necessary, to, unify, the, hindu, community, which, ideally, would, be, a, first, step, towards, unifying, the, nation, they, succeeded, in, passing, four, hindu, code, bills, in, 1955, 56, the, hindu, marriage, act, hindu, succession, act, hindu, minority, and, guardianship, act, and, hindu, adoptions, and, maintenance, act, those, who, practise, sikhism, jainism, and, buddhism, are, categorised, as, hindus, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, code, bill, nehru, specifically, wrote, article, 44, of, the, indian, constitution, under, the, directive, principles, of, state, policy, which, states, the, state, shall, endeavor, to, secure, for, the, citizens, a, uniform, civil, code, throughout, the, territory, of, india, the, article, has, formed, the, basis, of, secularism, in, india, however, nehru, has, been, criticised, for, the, inconsistent, application, of, the, law, most, notably, he, allowed, muslims, to, keep, their, personal, law, in, matters, relating, to, marriage, and, inheritance, in, the, small, state, of, goa, a, civil, code, based, on, the, old, portuguese, family, laws, was, allowed, to, continue, and, nehru, prohibited, muslim, personal, law, this, resulted, from, the, annexation, of, goa, in, 1961, by, india, when, nehru, promised, the, people, that, their, laws, would, be, left, intact, this, has, led, to, accusations, of, selective, secularism, while, nehru, exempted, muslim, law, from, legislation, and, they, remained, unreformed, he, passed, the, special, marriage, act, in, 1954, the, idea, behind, this, act, was, to, give, everyone, in, india, the, ability, to, marry, outside, the, personal, law, under, a, civil, marriage, in, many, respects, the, act, was, almost, identical, to, the, hindu, marriage, act, 1955, demonstrating, how, secularised, the, law, regarding, hindus, had, become, the, special, marriage, act, allowed, muslims, to, marry, under, it, and, keep, the, protections, generally, beneficial, to, muslim, women, that, could, not, be, found, in, the, personal, law, under, the, act, polygamy, was, illegal, and, inheritance, and, succession, would, be, governed, by, the, indian, succession, act, rather, than, the, respective, muslim, personal, law, divorce, would, be, governed, by, secular, law, and, maintenance, of, a, divorced, wife, would, be, along, the, lines, set, down, in, civil, law, the, constituent, assembly, debated, the, question, of, national, language, between, 1946, and, 1949, within, the, assembly, there, were, two, blocs, pro, hindi, and, anti, hindi, the, pro, hindi, bloc, was, further, divided, between, supporters, of, hindustani, led, by, nehru, and, supporters, of, modern, standard, hindi, based, on, sanskrit, the, anti, hindi, bloc, was, generally, in, favour, of, promoting, english, to, an, official, status, nehru, stated, that, we, must, have, our, own, language, but, english, must, continue, to, be, a, most, important, language, in, india, which, large, numbers, of, people, learn, and, learn, perhaps, compulsorily, after, an, exhaustive, and, divisive, debate, hindi, was, adopted, as, the, official, rather, than, national, language, of, india, in, 1950, with, english, continuing, as, an, associate, official, language, for, 15, years, after, which, hindi, would, become, the, sole, official, language, the, hindi, hindustani, debate, was, resolved, through, a, compromise, that, the, official, language, would, be, called, hindi, with, a, directive, clause, that, while, sanskrit, would, be, the, primary, source, of, vocabulary, the, traditional, hindustani, vocabulary, would, also, be, supported, claims, of, other, indian, languages, were, upheld, through, the, eighth, schedule, to, the, constitution, of, india, efforts, by, the, indian, government, to, make, hindi, the, sole, official, language, after, 1965, were, unacceptable, to, many, non, hindi, indian, states, which, wanted, the, continued, use, of, english, the, dravida, munnetra, kazhagam, dmk, a, descendant, of, dravidar, kazhagam, led, the, opposition, to, hindi, to, allay, their, fears, nehru, enacted, the, official, languages, act, in, 1963, to, ensure, the, continuing, use, of, english, beyond, 1965, the, text, of, the, act, did, not, satisfy, the, dmk, and, increased, their, scepticism, that, future, administrations, might, not, honour, his, assurances, the, congress, government, headed, by, indira, gandhi, eventually, amended, the, official, languages, act, in, 1967, to, guarantee, the, indefinite, use, of, hindi, and, english, as, official, languages, this, effectively, ensured, the, current, virtual, indefinite, policy, of, bilingualism, of, the, indian, republic, throughout, his, long, tenure, as, the, prime, minister, nehru, also, held, the, portfolio, of, external, affairs, his, idealistic, approach, focused, on, giving, india, a, leadership, position, in, nonalignment, he, sought, to, build, support, among, the, newly, independent, nations, of, asia, and, africa, in,

countries, as, prime, minister, of, the, dominion, of, india, he, acquiesced, only, after, krishna, menon, s, redrafting, of, the, 1949, london, declaration, under, which, india, agreed, to, remain, within, the, commonwealth, of, nations, after, becoming, a, republic, in, january, 1950, and, to, recognise, the, british, monarch, as, a, symbol, of, the, free, association, of, its, independent, member, nations, and, as, such, the, head, of, the, commonwealth, the, other, nations, of, the, commonwealth, recognised, india, s, continuing, membership, of, the, association, on, the, international, scene, nehru, was, an, opponent, of, military, action, and, military, alliances, he, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, united, nations, except, when, it, tried, to, resolve, the, kashmir, question, he, pioneered, the, policy, of, non, alignment, and, co, founded, the, non, aligned, movement, of, nations, professing, neutrality, between, the, rival, blocs, of, nations, led, by, the, us, and, the, ussr, the, term, non, alignment, was, coined, earlier, by, v, k, krishna, menon, at, the, united, nations, in, 1953, and, 1954, india, recognised, the, people, s, republic, of, china, soon, after, its, founding, while, most, of, the, western, bloc, continued, relations, with, taiwan, nehru, argued, for, its, inclusion, in, the, united, nations, and, refused, to, brand, the, chinese, as, the, aggressors, in, the, west, s, conflict, with, korea, he, sought, to, establish, warm, and, friendly, relations, with, china, in, 1950, and, hoped, to, act, as, an, intermediary, to, bridge, the, gulf, and, tensions, between, the, communist, states, and, the, western, bloc, nehru, was, a, key, organiser, of, the, bandung, conference, of, april, 1955, which, brought, 29, newly, independent, nations, together, from, asia, and, africa, and, was, designed, to, galvanise, the, nonalignment, movement, under, nehru, s, leadership, he, envisioned, it, as, his, key, leadership, opportunity, on, the, world, stage, where, he, would, bring, together, emerging, nations, he, was, one, of, the, key, participants, of, the, 1st, summit, of, the, non, aligned, movement, in, 1961, in, belgrade, fpr, yugoslavia, while, averse, to, war, nehru, led, the, campaigns, against, pakistan, in, kashmir, he, used, military, force, to, annexe, hyderabad, in, 1948, and, goa, in, 1961, while, laying, the, foundation, stone, of, the, national, defence, academy, in, 1949, he, stated, we, who, for, generations, had, talked, about, and, attempted, in, everything, a, peaceful, way, and, practised, non, violence, should, now, be, in, a, sense, glorifying, our, army, navy, and, air, force, it, means, a, lot, though, it, is, odd, yet, it, simply, reflects, the, oddness, of, life, though, life, is, logical, we, have, to, face, all, contingencies, and, unless, we, are, prepared, to, face, them, we, will, go, under, there, was, no, greater, prince, of, peace, and, apostle, of, non, violence, than, mahatma, gandhi, but, yet, he, said, it, was, better, to, take, the, sword, than, to, surrender, fail, or, run, away, we, cannot, live, carefree, assuming, that, we, are, safe, human, nature, is, such, we, cannot, take, the, risks, and, risk, our, hard, won, freedom, we, have, to, be, prepared, with, all, modern, defence, methods, and, a, well, equipped, army, navy, and,

nuclear, explosions, on, human, health, and, campaigned, ceaselessly, for, the, abolition, of, what, he, called, these, frightful, engines, of, destruction, he, also, had, pragmatic, reasons, for, promoting, de, nuclearization, fearing, a, nuclear, arms, race, would, lead, to, over, militarisation, that, would, be, unaffordable, for, developing, countries, such, as, his, own, at, lord, mountbatten, s, urging, in, 1948, nehru, had, promised, to, hold, a, plebiscite, in, kashmir, under, the, auspices, of, the, un, kashmir, was, a, disputed, territory, between, india, and, pakistan, the, two, have, gone, to, war, over, it, in, 1947, however, as, pakistan, failed, to, pull, back, troops, in, accordance, with, the, un, resolution, and, as, nehru, grew, increasingly, wary, of, the, un, he, declined, to, hold, a, plebiscite, in, 1953, his, policies, on, kashmir, and, the, integration, of, the, state, into, india, were, frequently, defended, before, the, united, nations, by, his, aide, v, k, krishna, menon, who, earned, a, reputation, in, india, for, his, passionate, speeches, in, 1953, nehru, orchestrated, the, ouster, and, arrest, of, sheikh, abdullah, the, prime, minister, of, kashmir, whom, he, had, previously, supported, but, was, now, suspected, of, harbouring, separatist, ambitions, bakshi, ghulam, mohammad, replaced, him, menon, was, instructed, to, deliver, an, unprecedented, eight, hour, speech, defending, india, s, stand, on, kashmir, in, 1957, to, date, the, speech, is, the, longest, ever, delivered, in, the, united, nations, security, council, covering, five, hours, of, the, 762nd, meeting, on, 23, january, and, two, hours, and, forty, eight, minutes, on, the, 24th, reportedly, concluding, with, menon, s, collapse, on, the, security, council, floor,

principles, again, came, to, be, seen, as, important, in, china, india, relations, and, more, generally, as, norms, of, relations, between, states, they, became, widely, recognised, and, accepted, throughout, the, region, during, the, premiership, of, indira, gandhi, and, the, three, year, rule, of, the, janata, party, 1977, 1980, although, the, five, principles, of, peaceful, coexistence,
