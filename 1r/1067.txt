charioteer, which, scandalized, his, aristocratic, contemporaries, as, these, occupations, were, usually, the, domain, of, slaves, public, entertainers, and, infamous, persons, however, the, provision, of, such, entertainments, made, nero, popular, among, lower, class, citizens, the, costs, involved, were, borne, by, local, elites, either, directly, or, through, taxation, and, were, much,

people, thought, him, compulsive, and, corrupt, suetonius, tells, that, many, romans, believed, the, great, fire, of, rome, was, instigated, by, nero, to, clear, land, for, his, planned, golden, house, tacitus, claims, nero, seized, christians, as, scapegoats, for, the, fire, and, had, them, burned, alive, seemingly, motivated, not, by, public, justice, but, personal, cruelty, some, modern, historians, question, the, reliability, of, ancient, sources, on, nero, s, tyrannical, acts, considering, his, popularity, among, the, roman, commoners, in, the, eastern, provinces, of, the, empire, a, popular, legend, arose, that, nero, had, not, died, and, would, return, after, his, death, at, least, three, leaders, of, short, lived, failed, rebellions, presented, themselves, as, nero, reborn,

was, known, to, be, irascible, and, brutal, and, that, both, enjoyed, chariot, races, and, theater, performances, to, a, degree, not, befitting, their, position, suetonius, also, mentions, that, when, nero, s, father, domitius, was, congratulated, by, his, friends, for, the, birth, of, his, son, he, replied, that, any, child, born, to, him, and, agrippina, would, have, a, detestable, nature, and, become, a, public, danger, domitius, died, in, ad, 41, a, few, years, before, his, father, s, death, his, father, was, involved, in, a, serious, political, scandal, his, mother, and, his, two,

josiah, osgood, has, written, that, the, coins, through, their, distribution, and, imagery, alike, showed, that, a, new, leader, was, in, the, making, however, david, shotter, noted, that, despite, events, in, rome, nero, s, step, brother, britannicus, was, more, prominent, in, provincial, coinages, during, the, early, 50s, nero, formally, entered, public, life, as, an, adult, in, ad, 51, while,

suffered, a, devastating, fire, claudius, died, in, ad, 54, many, ancient, historians, claim, that, he, was, poisoned, by, agrippina, shotter, has, written, that, claudius, death, has, usually, been, regarded, as, an, event, hastened, by, agrippina, due, to, signs, that, claudius, was, showing, a, renewed, affection, for, his, natural, son, he, notes, that, among, ancient, sources, the, roman, historian, josephus, was, uniquely, reserved, in, describing, the, poisoning, as, a, rumor, contemporary, sources, differ, in, their, accounts, of, the, poisoning, tacitus, says, that, the, poison, maker, locusta, prepared, the, toxin, which, was, served, to, the, emperor, by, his, servant, halotus, tacitus, also, writes, that, agrippina, arranged, for, claudius, doctor, xenophon, to, administer, poison, in, the, event, that, the, emperor, survived, suetonius, differs, in, some, details, but, also, implicates, halotus, and, agrippina, like, tacitus, cassius, dio, writes, that, the, poison, was, prepared, by, locusta, but, in, dio, s, account, it, is, administered, by, agrippina, instead, of, halotus, in, apocolocyntosis, seneca, the, younger, does, not, mention, mushrooms, at, all, agrippina, s, involvement, in, claudius, death, is, not, accepted, by, all, modern, scholars, before, claudius, death, agrippina, had, maneuvered, to, remove, claudius, sons, tutors, in, order, to, replace, them, with, tutors, that, she, had, selected, she, was, also, able, to, convince, claudius, to, replace, two, prefects, of, the, praetorian, guard, who, were, suspected, of, supporting, claudius, son, with, afranius, burrus, nero, s, future, guide, since, agrippina, had, replaced, the, guard, officers, with, men, loyal, to, her, nero, was, subsequently, able, to, assume, power, without, incident, the, main, ancient, roman, literary, sources, for, nero, s, reign, are, tacitus, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, they, found, nero, s, construction, projects, overly, extravagant, and, claim, that, their, cost, left, italy, thoroughly, exhausted, by, contributions, of, money, with, the, provinces, ruined, modern, historians, note, that, the, period, was, riddled, with, deflation, and, that, nero, intended, his, spending, on, public, work, and, charities, to, ease, economic, troubles, nero, became, emperor, in, ad, 54, aged, 16, his, tutor, seneca, prepared, nero, s, first, speech, before, the, senate, during, this, speech, nero, spoke, about, eliminating, the, ills, of, the, previous, regime, h, h, scullard, writes, that, he, promised, to, follow, the, augustan, model, in, his, principate, to, end, all, secret, trials, intra, cubiculum, to, have, done, with, the, corruption, of, court, favorites, and, freedmen, and, above, all, to, respect, the, privileges, of, the, senate, and, individual, senators, his, respect, for, senatorial, autonomy, which, distinguished, him, from, caligula, and, claudius, was, generally, well, received, by, the, roman, senate, scullard, writes, that, nero, s, mother, agrippina, meant, to, rule, through, her, son, agrippina, murdered, her, political, rivals, domitia, lepida, the, younger, the, aunt, that, nero, had, lived, with, during, agrippina, s, exile, marcus, junius, silanus, a, great, grandson, of, augustus, and, narcissus, one, of, the, earliest, coins, that, nero, issued, during, his, reign, shows, agrippina, on, the, coin, s, obverse, side, usually, this, would, be, reserved, for, a, portrait, of, the, emperor, the, senate, also, allowed, agrippina, two, lictors, during, public, appearances, an, honor, that, was, customarily, bestowed, upon, only, magistrates, and, the, vestalis, maxima, in, ad, 55, nero, removed, agrippina, s, ally, marcus, antonius, pallas, from, his, position, in, the, treasury, shotter, writes, the, following, about, agrippina, s, deteriorating, relationship, with, nero, what, seneca, and, burrus, probably, saw, as, relatively, harmless, in, nero, his, cultural, pursuits, and, his, affair, with, the, slave, girl, claudia, acte, were, to, her, signs, of, her, son, s, dangerous, emancipation, of, himself, from, her, influence, britannicus, was, poisoned, after, agrippina, threatened, to, side, with, him, nero, who, was, having, an, affair, with, acte, exiled, agrippina, from, the, palace, when, she, began, to, cultivate, a, relationship, with, his, wife, octavia, j, rgen, malitz, writes, that, ancient, sources, do, not, provide, any, clear, evidence, to, evaluate, the, extent, of, nero, s, personal, involvement, in, politics, during, the, first, years, of, his, reign, he, describes, the, policies, that, are, explicitly, attributed, to, nero, as, well, meant, but, incompetent, notions, like, nero, s, failed, initiative, to, abolish, all, taxes, in, ad, 58, scholars, generally, credit, nero, s, advisors, burrus, and, seneca, with, the, administrative, successes, of, these, years, malitz, writes, that, in, later, years, nero, panicked, when, he, had, to, make, decisions, on, his, own, during, times, of, crisis, nevertheless, his, early, administration, ruled, to, great, acclaim, a, generation, later, those, years, were, seen, in, retrospect, as, an, exemplar, of, good, and, moderate, government, and, described, as, quinquennium, neronis, by, trajan, especially, well, received, were, fiscal, reforms, which, among, others, put, tax, collectors, under, more, strict, control, by, establishing, local, offices, to, supervise, their, activities, after, the, affair, of, lucius, pedanius, secundus, who, was, murdered, by, a, desperate, slave, nero, allowed, slaves, to, file, complaints, about, their, treatment, to, the, authorities, outside, of, rome, nero, had, several, villas, or, palaces, built, the, ruins, of, which, can, still, be, seen, today, these, included, the, villa, of, nero, at, antium, his, place, of, birth, where, he, razed, the, villa, on, the, site, to, rebuild, it, on, a, more, massive, and, imperial, scale, and, including, a, theatre, at, subiaco, lazio, near, rome, he, had, 3, artificial, lakes, built, with, waterfalls, bridges, and, walkways, for, the, luxurious, villa, he, stayed, at, the, villa, of, nero, at, olympia, greece, during, his, participation, at, the, olympic, games, of, ad, 67, according, to, suetonius, nero, had, his, former, freedman, anicetus, arrange, a, shipwreck, which, agrippina, managed, to, survive, she, then, swam, ashore, and, was, executed, by, anicetus, who, reported, her, death, as, a, suicide, the, oxford, encyclopedia, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, cautiously, notes, that, nero, s, reasons, for, killing, his, mother, in, ad, 59, are, not, fully, understood, according, to, tacitus, the, source, of, conflict, between, nero, and, his, mother, was, nero, s, affair, with, poppaea, sabina, in, histories, tacitus, writes, that, the, affair, began, while, poppaea, was, still, married, to, rufrius, crispinus, but, in, his, later, work, annals, tacitus, says, poppaea, was, married, to, otho, when, the, affair, began, in, annals, tacitus, writes, that, agrippina, opposed, nero, s, affair, with, poppaea, because, of, her, affection, for, his, wife, octavia, anthony, a, barrett, writes, that, tacitus, account, in, annals, suggests, that, poppaea, s, challenge, drove, over, the, brink, a, number, of, modern, historians, have, noted, that, agrippina, s, death, would, not, have, offered, much, advantage, for, poppaea, as, nero, did, not, marry, poppaea, until, ad, 62, barrett, writes, that, poppaea, seems, to, serve, as, a, literary, device, utilized, because, could, see, no, plausible, explanation, for, nero, s, conduct, and, also, incidentally, to, show, that, nero, like, claudius, had, fallen, under, the, malign, influence, of, a, woman, modern, scholars, believe, that, nero, s, reign, had, been, going, well, in, the, years, before, agrippina, s, death, for, example, nero, promoted, the, exploration, of, the, nile, river, sources, with, a, successful, expedition, after, agrippina, s, exile, burrus, and, seneca, were, responsible, for, the, administration, of, the, empire, however, nero, s, conduct, became, far, more, egregious, after, his, mother, s, death, miriam, t, griffins, suggests, that, nero, s, decline, began, as, early, as, ad, 55, with, the, murder, of, his, stepbrother, britannicus, but, also, notes, that, nero, lost, all, sense, of, right, and, wrong, and, listened, to, flattery, with, total, credulity, after, agrippina, s, death, griffin, points, out, that, tacitus, makes, explicit, the, significance, of, agrippina, s, removal, for, nero, s, conduct, he, began, to, build, a, new, palace, the, domus, transitoria, from, about, ad, 60, it, was, intended, to, connect, all, of, the, imperial, estates, that, had, been, acquired, in, various, ways, with, the, palatine, including, the, gardens, of, maecenas, horti, lamiani, horti, lolliani, etc, in, ad, 62, nero, s, adviser, burrus, died, that, same, year, nero, called, for, the, first, treason, trial, of, his, reign, maiestas, trial, against, antistius, sosianus, he, also, executed, his, rivals, cornelius, sulla, and, rubellius, plautus, j, rgen, malitz, considers, this, to, be, a, turning, point, in, nero, s, relationship, with, the, roman, senate, malitz, writes, that, nero, abandoned, the, restraint, he, had, previously, shown, because, he, believed, a, course, supporting, the, senate, promised, to, be, less, and, less, profitable, after, burrus, death, nero, appointed, two, new, praetorian, prefects, faenius, rufus, and, ofonius, tigellinus, politically, isolated, seneca, was, forced, to, retire, according, to, tacitus, nero, divorced, octavia, on, grounds, of, infertility, and, banished, her, after, public, protests, over, octavia, s, exile, nero, accused, her, of, adultery, with, anicetus, and, she, was, executed, in, ad, 64, during, the, saturnalia, nero, married, pythagoras, a, freedman, the, great, fire, of, rome, began, on, the, night, of, 18, to, 19, july, 64, probably, in, one, of, the, merchant, shops, on, the, slope, of, the, aventine, overlooking, the, circus, maximus, or, in, the, wooden, outer, seating, of, the, circus, itself, rome, had, always, been, vulnerable, to, fires, and, this, one, was, fanned, to, catastrophic, proportions, by, the, winds, tacitus, cassius, dio, and, modern, archaeology, describe, the, destruction, of, mansions, ordinary, residences, public, buildings, and, temples, on, the, aventine, palatine, and, caelian, hills, the, fire, burned, for, over, seven, days, before, subsiding, it, then, started, again, and, burned, for, three, more, it, destroyed, three, of, rome, s, 14, districts, and, severely, damaged, seven, more, some, romans, thought, the, fire, an, accident, as, the, merchant, shops, were, timber, framed, and, sold, flammable, goods, and, the, outer, seating, stands, of, the, circus, were, timber, built, others, claimed, it, was, arson, committed, on, nero, s, behalf, the, accounts, by, pliny, the, elder, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, suggest, several, possible, reasons, for, nero, s, alleged, arson, including, his, creation, of, a, real, life, backdrop, to, a, theatrical, performance, about, the, burning, of, troy, suetonius, wrote, that, nero, started, the, fire, to, clear, the, site, for, his, planned, palatial, golden, house, this, would, include, lush, artificial, landscapes, and, a, 30, meter, tall, statue, of, himself, the, colossus, of, nero, sited, more, or, less, where, the, colosseum, would, eventually, be, built, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, claim, that, nero, sang, the, sack, of, ilium, in, stage, costume, while, the, city, burned, the, popular, legend, that, nero, played, the, lyre, while, rome, burned, is, at, least, partly, a, literary, construct, of, flavian, propaganda, which, looked, askance, on, the, abortive, neronian, attempt, to, rewrite, augustan, models, of, rule, tacitus, suspends, judgment, on, nero, s, responsibility, for, the, fire, he, found, that, nero, was, in, antium, when, the, fire, started, and, returned, to, rome, to, organize, a, relief, effort, providing, for, the, removal, of, bodies, and, debris, which, he, paid, for, from, his, own, funds, after, the, fire, nero, opened, his, palaces, to, provide, shelter, for, the, homeless, and, arranged, for, food, supplies, to, be, delivered, in, order, to, prevent, starvation, among, the, survivors, tacitus, writes, that, to, remove, suspicion, from, himself, nero, accused, christians, of, starting, the, fire, according, to, this, account, many, christians, were, arrested, and, brutally, executed, by, being, thrown, to, the, beasts, crucified, and, being, burned, alive, tacitus, asserts, that, in, his, imposition, of, such, ferocious, punishments, nero, was, not, motivated, by, a, sense, of, justice, but, by, a, penchant, for, personal, cruelty, houses, built, after, the, fire, were, spaced, out, built, in, brick, and, faced, by, porticos, on, wide, roads, nero, also, built, himself, a, new, palace, complex, known, as, the, domus, aurea, in, an, area, cleared, by, the, fire, the, cost, to, rebuild, rome, was, immense, requiring, funds, the, state, treasury, did, not, have, to, find, the, necessary, funds, for, the, reconstruction, nero, s, government, increased, taxation, particularly, heavy, tributes, were, imposed, on, the, provinces, of, the, empire, to, meet, at, least, a, portion, of, the, costs, nero, devalued, the, roman, currency, increasing, inflationary, pressure, for, the, first, time, in, the, empire, s, history, in, ad, 65, gaius, calpurnius, piso, a, roman, statesman, organized, a, conspiracy, against, nero, with, the, help, of, subrius, flavus, and, sulpicius, asper, a, tribune, and, a, centurion, of, the, praetorian, guard, according, to, tacitus, many, conspirators, wished, to, rescue, the, state, from, the, emperor, and, restore, the, republic, the, freedman, milichus, discovered, the, conspiracy, and, reported, it, to, nero, s, secretary, epaphroditus, as, a, result, the, conspiracy, failed, and, its, members, were, executed, including, lucan, the, poet, nero, s, previous, advisor, seneca, was, accused, by, natalis, he, denied, the, charges, but, was, still, ordered, to, commit, suicide, as, by, this, point, he, had, fallen, out, of, favor, with, nero, nero, was, said, to, have, kicked, poppaea, to, death, in, ad, 65, before, she, could, give, birth, to, his, second, child, modern, historians, noting, the, probable, biases, of, suetonius, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, and, the, likely, absence, of, eyewitnesses, to, such, an, event, propose, that, poppaea, may, have, died, after, miscarriage, or, in, childbirth, nero, went, into, deep, mourning, poppaea, was, given, a, sumptuous, state, funeral, and, divine, honors, and, was, promised, a, temple, for, her, cult, a, year, s, importation, of, incense, was, burned, at, the, funeral, her, body, was, not, cremated, as, would, have, been, strictly, customary, but, embalmed, after, the, egyptian, manner, and, entombed, it, is, not, known, where, in, ad, 67, nero, married, sporus, a, young, boy, who, is, said, to, have, greatly, resembled, poppaea, nero, had, him, castrated, and, married, him, with, all, the, usual, ceremonies, including, a, dowry, and, a, bridal, veil, it, is, believed, that, he, did, this, out, of, regret, for, his, killing, of, poppaea, in, march, 68, gaius, julius, vindex, the, governor, of, gallia, lugdunensis, rebelled, against, nero, s, tax, policies, lucius, verginius, rufus, the, governor, of, germania, superior, was, ordered, to, put, down, vindex, s, rebellion, in, an, attempt, to, gain, support, from, outside, his, own, province, vindex, called, upon, servius, sulpicius, galba, the, governor, of, hispania, tarraconensis, to, join, the, rebellion, and, to, declare, himself, emperor, in, opposition, to, nero, at, the, battle, of, vesontio, in, may, 68, verginius, forces, easily, defeated, those, of, vindex, and, the, latter, committed, suicide, however, after, defeating, the, rebel, verginius, legions, attempted, to, proclaim, their, own, commander, as, emperor, verginius, refused, to, act, against, nero, but, the, discontent, of, the, legions, of, germania, and, the, continued, opposition, of, galba, in, hispania, did, not, bode, well, for, him, while, nero, had, retained, some, control, of, the, situation, support, for, galba, increased, despite, his, being, officially, declared, a, public, enemy, the, prefect, of, the, praetorian, guard, gaius, nymphidius, sabinus, also, abandoned, his, allegiance, to, the, emperor, and, came, out, in, support, of, galba, in, response, nero, fled, rome, with, the, intention, of, going, to, the, port, of, ostia, and, from, there, to, take, a, fleet, to, one, of, the, still, loyal, eastern, provinces, according, to, suetonius, nero, abandoned, the, idea, when, some, army, officers, openly, refused, to, obey, his, commands, responding, with, a, line, from, virgil, s, aeneid, is, it, so, dreadful, a, thing, then, to, die, nero, then, toyed, with, the, idea, of, fleeing, to, parthia, throwing, himself, upon, the, mercy, of, galba, or, appealing, to, the, people, and, begging, them, to, pardon, him, for, his, past, offences, and, if, he, could, not, soften, their, hearts, to, entreat, them, at, least, to, allow, him, the, prefecture, of, egypt, suetonius, reports, that, the, text, of, this, speech, was, later, found, in, nero, s, writing, desk, but, that, he, dared, not, give, it, from, fear, of, being, torn, to, pieces, before, he, could, reach, the, forum, nero, returned, to, rome, and, spent, the, evening, in, the, palace, after, sleeping, he, awoke, at, about, midnight, to, find, the, palace, guard, had, left, dispatching, messages, to, his, friends, palace, chambers, for, them, to, come, he, received, no, answers, upon, going, to, their, chambers, personally, he, found, them, all, abandoned, when, he, called, for, a, gladiator, or, anyone, else, adept, with, a, sword, to, kill, him, no, one, appeared, he, cried, have, i, neither, friend, nor, foe, and, ran, out, as, if, to, throw, himself, into, the, tiber, returning, nero, sought, a, place, where, he, could, hide, and, collect, his, thoughts, an, imperial, freedman, phaon, offered, his, villa, located, 4, mi, 6, 4, km, outside, the, city, travelling, in, disguise, nero, and, four, loyal, freedmen, epaphroditus, phaon, neophytus, and, sporus, reached, the, villa, where, nero, ordered, them, to, dig, a, grave, for, him, at, this, time, nero, learned, that, the, senate, had, declared, him, a, public, enemy, nero, prepared, himself, for, suicide, pacing, up, and, down, muttering, qualis, artifex, pereo, what, an, artist, the, world, is, losing, losing, his, nerve, he, begged, one, of, his, companions, to, set, an, example, by, killing, himself, first, at, last, the, sound, of, approaching, horsemen, drove, nero, to, face, the, end, however, he, still, could, not, bring, himself, to, take, his, own, life, but, instead, forced, his, private, secretary, epaphroditus, to, perform, the, task, when, one, of, the, horsemen, entered, and, saw, that, nero, was, dying, he, attempted, to, stop, the, bleeding, but, efforts, to, save, nero, s, life, were, unsuccessful, nero, s, final, words, were, too, late, this, is, fidelity, he, died, on, 9, june, 68, the, anniversary, of, the, death, of, his, first, wife, claudia, octavia, and, was, buried, in, the, mausoleum, of, the, domitii, ahenobarbi, in, what, is, now, the, villa, borghese, pincian, hill, area, of, rome, according, to, sulpicius, severus, it, is, unclear, whether, nero, took, his, own, life, with, his, death, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, ended, 19, chaos, would, ensue, in, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, according, to, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, the, people, of, rome, celebrated, the, death, of, nero, tacitus, though, describes, a, more, complicated, political, environment, tacitus, mentions, that, nero, s, death, was, welcomed, by, senators, nobility, and, the, upper, class, the, lower, class, slaves, frequenters, of, the, arena, and, the, theater, and, those, who, were, supported, by, the, famous, excesses, of, nero, on, the, other, hand, were, upset, with, the, news, members, of, the, military, were, said, to, have, mixed, feelings, as, they, had, allegiance, to, nero, but, had, been, bribed, to, overthrow, him, eastern, sources, namely, philostratus, and, apollonius, of, tyana, mention, that, nero, s, death, was, mourned, as, he, restored, the, liberties, of, hellas, with, a, wisdom, and, moderation, quite, alien, to, his, character, and, that, he, held, our, liberties, in, his, hand, and, respected, them, modern, scholarship, generally, holds, that, while, the, senate, and, more, well, off, individuals, welcomed, nero, s, death, the, general, populace, was, loyal, to, the, end, and, beyond, for, otho, and, vitellius, both, thought, it, worthwhile, to, appeal, to, their, nostalgia, nero, s, name, was, erased, from, some, monuments, in, what, edward, champlin, regards, as, an, outburst, of, private, zeal, many, portraits, of, nero, were, reworked, to, represent, other, figures, according, to, eric, r, varner, over, 50, such, images, survive, this, reworking, of, images, is, often, explained, as, part, of, the, way, in, which, the, memory, of, disgraced, emperors, was, condemned, posthumously, a, practice, known, as, damnatio, memoriae, champlin, doubts, that, the, practice, is, necessarily, negative, and, notes, that, some, continued, to, create, images, of, nero, long, after, his, death, damaged, portraits, of, nero, often, with, hammer, blows, directed, to, the, face, have, been, found, in, many, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, three, recently, having, been, identified, from, the, united, kingdom, the, civil, war, during, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, was, described, by, ancient, historians, as, a, troubling, period, according, to, tacitus, this, instability, was, rooted, in, the, fact, that, emperors, could, no, longer, rely, on, the, perceived, legitimacy, of, the, imperial, bloodline, as, nero, and, those, before, him, could, galba, began, his, short, reign, with, the, execution, of, many, of, nero, s, allies, one, such, notable, enemy, included, nymphidius, sabinus, who, claimed, to, be, the, son, of, emperor, caligula, otho, overthrew, galba, otho, was, said, to, be, liked, by, many, soldiers, because, he, had, been, a, friend, of, nero, and, resembled, him, somewhat, in, temperament, it, was, said, that, the, common, roman, hailed, otho, as, nero, himself, otho, used, nero, as, a, surname, and, reerected, many, statues, to, nero, vitellius, overthrew, otho, vitellius, began, his, reign, with, a, large, funeral, for, nero, complete, with, songs, written, by, nero, after, nero, s, death, in, ad, 68, there, was, a, widespread, belief, especially, in, the, eastern, provinces, that, he, was, not, dead, and, somehow, would, return, this, belief, came, to, be, known, as, the, nero, redivivus, legend, the, legend, of, nero, s, return, lasted, for, hundreds, of, years, after, nero, s, death, augustine, of, hippo, wrote, of, the, legend, as, a, popular, belief, in, ad, 422, at, least, three, nero, impostors, emerged, leading, rebellions, the, first, who, sang, and, played, the, cithara, or, lyre, and, whose, face, was, similar, to, that, of, the, dead, emperor, appeared, in, 69, ad, during, the, reign, of, vitellius, after, persuading, some, to, recognize, him, he, was, captured, and, executed, sometime, during, the, reign, of, titus, 79, 81, another, impostor, appeared, in, asia, and, sang, to, the, accompaniment, of, the, lyre, and, looked, like, nero, but, he, too, was, killed, twenty, years, after, nero, s, death, during, the, reign, of, domitian, there, was, a, third, pretender, he, was, supported, by, the, parthians, who, only, reluctantly, gave, him, up, and, the, matter, almost, came, to, war, in, britannia, britain, in, ad, 59, prasutagus, leader, of, the, iceni, tribe, and, a, client, king, of, rome, during, claudius, reign, had, died, the, client, state, arrangement, was, unlikely, to, survive, following, the, death, of, claudius, the, will, of, the, iceni, tribal, king, prasutagus, leaving, control, of, the, iceni, to, his, daughters, was, denied, when, the, roman, procurator, catus, decianus, scourged, prasutagus, wife, boudica, and, raped, her, daughters, the, iceni, revolted, they, were, joined, by, the, celtic, trinovantes, tribe, and, their, uprising, became, the, most, significant, provincial, rebellion, of, the, 1st, century, ad, under, queen, boudica, the, towns, of, camulodunum, colchester, londinium, london, and, verulamium, st, albans, were, burned, and, a, substantial, body, of, roman, legion, infantry, were, eliminated, the, governor, of, the, province, gaius, suetonius, paulinus, assembled, his, remaining, forces, and, defeated, the, britons, although, order, was, restored, for, some, time, nero, considered, abandoning, the, province, julius, classicianus, replaced, the, former, procurator, catus, decianus, and, classicianus, advised, nero, to, replace, paulinus, who, continued, to, punish, the, population, even, after, the, rebellion, was, over, nero, decided, to, adopt, a, more, lenient, approach, by, appointing, a, new, governor, petronius, turpilianus, nero, began, preparing, for, war, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, after, the, parthian, king, vologeses, set, his, brother, tiridates, on, the, armenian, throne, around, ad, 57, and, ad, 58, domitius, corbulo, and, his, legions, advanced, on, tiridates, and, captured, the, armenian, capital, artaxata, tigranes, was, chosen, to, replace, tiridates, on, the, armenian, throne, when, tigranes, attacked, adiabene, nero, had, to, send, further, legions, to, defend, armenia, and, syria, from, parthia, the, roman, victory, came, at, a, time, when, the, parthians, were, troubled, by, revolts, when, this, was, dealt, with, they, were, able, to, devote, resources, to, the, armenian, situation, a, roman, army, under, paetus, surrendered, under, humiliating, circumstances, and, though, both, roman, and, parthian, forces, withdrew, from, armenia, it, was, under, parthian, control, the, triumphal, arch, for, corbulo, s, earlier, victory, was, part, built, when, parthian, envoys, arrived, in, ad, 63, to, discuss, treaties, given, imperium, over, the, eastern, regions, corbulo, organised, his, forces, for, an, invasion, but, was, met, by, this, parthian, delegation, an, agreement, was, thereafter, reached, with, the, parthians, rome, would, recognize, tiridates, as, king, of, armenia, only, if, he, agreed, to, receive, his, diadem, from, nero, a, coronation, ceremony, was, held, in, italy, ad, 66, dio, reports, that, tiridates, said, i, have, come, to, you, my, god, worshiping, you, as, mithras, shotter, says, this, parallels, other, divine, designations, that, were, commonly, applied, to, nero, in, the, east, including, the, new, apollo, and, the, new, sun, after, the, coronation, friendly, relations, were, established, between, rome, and, the, eastern, kingdoms, of, parthia, and, armenia, artaxata, was, temporarily, renamed, neroneia, in, 66, there, was, a, jewish, revolt, in, judea, stemming, from, greek, and, jewish, religious, tension, in, 67, nero, dispatched, vespasian, to, restore, order, this, revolt, was, eventually, put, down, in, 70, after, nero, s, death, this, revolt, is, famous, for, romans, breaching, the, walls, of, jerusalem, and, destroying, the, second, temple, of, jerusalem, nero, studied, poetry, music, painting, and, sculpture, he, both, sang, and, played, the, cithara, a, type, of, lyre, many, of, these, disciplines, were, standard, education, for, the, roman, elite, but, nero, s, devotion, to, music, exceeded, what, was, socially, acceptable, for, a, roman, of, his, class, ancient, sources, were, critical, of, nero, s, emphasis, on, the, arts, chariot, racing, and, athletics, pliny, described, nero, as, an, actor, emperor, scaenici, imperatoris, and, suetonius, wrote, that, he, was, carried, away, by, a, craze, for, popularity, since, he, was, acclaimed, as, the, equal, of, apollo, in, music, and, of, the, sun, in, driving, a, chariot, he, had, planned, to, emulate, the, exploits, of, hercules, as, well, 53, in, ad, 67, nero, participated, in, the, olympics, he, had, bribed, organizers, to, postpone, the, games, for, a, year, so, he, could, participate, and, artistic, competitions, were, added, to, the, athletic, events, nero, won, every, contest, in, which, he, was, a, competitor, during, the, games, nero, sang, and, played, his, lyre, on, stage, acted, in, tragedies, and, raced, chariots, he, won, a, 10, horse, chariot, race, despite, being, thrown, from, the, chariot, and, leaving, the, race, he, was, crowned, on, the, basis, that, he, would, have, won, if, he, had, completed, the, race, after, he, died, a, year, later, his, name, was, removed, from, the, list, of, winners, champlin, writes, that, though, nero, s, participation, effectively, stifled, true, competition, seems, to, have, been, oblivious, of, reality, 54, 55, nero, established, the, neronian, games, in, ad, 60, modeled, on, greek, style, games, these, games, included, musical, gymnastic, and, equestrian, contests, according, to, suetonius, the, gymnastic, contests, were, held, in, the, saepta, area, of, the, campus, martius, 288, the, history, of, nero, s, reign, is, problematic, in, that, no, historical, sources, survived, that, were, contemporary, with, nero, these, first, histories, while, they, still, existed, were, described, as, biased, and, fantastical, either, overly, critical, or, praising, of, nero, the, original, sources, were, also, said, to, contradict, on, a, number, of, events, nonetheless, these, lost, primary, sources, were, the, basis, of, surviving, secondary, and, tertiary, histories, on, nero, written, by, the, next, generations, of, historians, a, few, of, the, contemporary, historians, are, known, by, name, fabius, rusticus, cluvius, rufus, and, pliny, the, elder, all, wrote, condemning, histories, on, nero, that, are, now, lost, there, were, also, pro, nero, histories, but, it, is, unknown, who, wrote, them, or, for, what, deeds, nero, was, praised, the, bulk, of, what, is, known, of, nero, comes, from, tacitus, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, who, were, all, of, the, upper, classes, tacitus, and, suetonius, wrote, their, histories, on, nero, over, 50, years, after, his, death, while, cassius, dio, wrote, his, history, over, 150, years, after, nero, s, death, these, sources, contradict, one, another, on, a, number, of, events, in, nero, s, life, including, the, death, of, claudius, the, death, of, agrippina, and, the, roman, fire, of, ad, 64, but, they, are, consistent, in, their, condemnation, of, nero, cassius, dio, c, 155, 229, was, the, son, of, cassius, apronianus, a, roman, senator, he, passed, the, greater, part, of, his, life, in, public, service, he, was, a, senator, under, commodus, and, governor, of, smyrna, after, the, death, of, septimius, severus, and, afterwards, suffect, consul, around, 205, and, also, proconsul, in, africa, and, pannonia, books, 61, 63, of, dio, s, roman, history, describe, the, reign, of, nero, only, fragments, of, these, books, remain, and, what, does, remain, was, abridged, and, altered, by, john, xiphilinus, an, 11th, century, monk, dio, chrysostom, c, 40, 120, a, greek, philosopher, and, historian, wrote, the, roman, people, were, very, happy, with, nero, and, would, have, allowed, him, to, rule, indefinitely, they, longed, for, his, rule, once, he, was, gone, and, embraced, imposters, when, they, appeared, indeed, the, truth, about, this, has, not, come, out, even, yet, for, so, far, as, the, rest, of, his, subjects, were, concerned, there, was, nothing, to, prevent, his, continuing, to, be, emperor, for, all, time, seeing, that, even, now, everybody, wishes, he, were, still, alive, and, the, great, majority, do, believe, that, he, still, is, although, in, a, certain, sense, he, has, died, not, once, but, often, along, with, those, who, had, been, firmly, convinced, that, he, was, still, alive, epictetus, c, 55, 135, was, the, slave, to, nero, s, scribe, epaphroditos, he, makes, a, few, passing, negative, comments, on, nero, s, character, in, his, work, but, makes, no, remarks, on, the, nature, of, his, rule, he, describes, nero, as, a, spoiled, angry, and, unhappy, man, the, historian, josephus, c, 37, 100, while, calling, nero, a, tyrant, was, also, the, first, to, mention, bias, against, nero, of, other, historians, he, said, but, i, omit, any, further, discourse, about, these, affairs, for, there, have, been, a, great, many, who, have, composed, the, history, of, nero, some, of, which, have, departed, from, the, truth, of, facts, out, of, favour, as, having, received, benefits, from, him, while, others, out, of, hatred, to, him, and, the, great, ill, will, which, they, bore, him, have, so, impudently, raved, against, him, with, their, lies, that, they, justly, deserve, to, be, condemned, nor, do, i, wonder, at, such, as, have, told, lies, of, nero, since, they, have, not, in, their, writings, preserved, the, truth, of, history, as, to, those, facts, that, were, earlier, than, his, time, even, when, the, actors, could, have, no, way, incurred, their, hatred, since, those, writers, lived, a, long, time, after, them, although, more, of, a, poet, than, a, historian, lucanus, c, 39, 65, has, one, of, the, kindest, accounts, of, nero, s, rule, he, writes, of, peace, and, prosperity, under, nero, in, contrast, to, previous, war, and, strife, ironically, he, was, later, involved, in, a, conspiracy, to, overthrow, nero, and, was, executed, philostratus, ii, the, athenian, c, 172, 250, spoke, of, nero, in, the, life, of, apollonius, of, tyana, books, 4, 5, although, he, has, a, generally, bad, or, dim, view, of, nero, he, speaks, of, others, positive, reception, of, nero, in, the, east, the, history, of, nero, by, pliny, the, elder, c, 24, 79, did, not, survive, still, there, are, several, references, to, nero, in, pliny, s, natural, histories, pliny, has, one, of, the, worst, opinions, of, nero, and, calls, him, an, enemy, of, mankind, plutarch, c, 46, 127, mentions, nero, indirectly, in, his, account, of, the, life, of, galba, and, the, life, of, otho, as, well, as, in, the, vision, of, thespesius, in, book, 7, of, the, moralia, where, a, voice, orders, that, nero, s, soul, be, transferred, to, a, more, offensive, species, nero, is, portrayed, as, a, tyrant, but, those, that, replace, him, are, not, described, as, better, seneca, c, 4, bc, ad, 65, nero, s, teacher, and, advisor, writes, very, positively, of, nero, suetonius, c, 69, 130, was, a, member, of, the, equestrian, order, and, he, was, the, head, of, the, department, of, the, imperial, correspondence, while, in, this, position, suetonius, started, writing, biographies, of, the, emperors, accentuating, the, anecdotal, and, sensational, aspects, by, this, account, nero, raped, the, vestal, virgin, rubria, the, annals, by, tacitus, c, 56, 117, is, the, most, detailed, and, comprehensive, history, on, the, rule, of, nero, despite, being, incomplete, after, the, year, ad, 66, tacitus, described, the, rule, of, the, julio, claudian, emperors, as, generally, unjust, he, also, thought, that, existing, writing, on, them, was, unbalanced, the, histories, of, tiberius, caius, claudius, and, nero, while, they, were, in, power, were, falsified, through, terror, and, after, their, death, were, written, under, the, irritation, of, a, recent, hatred, tacitus, was, the, son, of, a, procurator, who, married, into, the, elite, family, of, agricola, he, entered, his, political, life, as, a, senator, after, nero, s, death, and, by, tacitus, own, admission, owed, much, to, nero, s, rivals, realising, that, this, bias, may, be, apparent, to, others, tacitus, protests, that, his, writing, is, true, in, 1562, girolamo, cardano, published, in, basel, his, encomium, neronis, which, was, one, of, the, first, historical, references, of, the, modern, era, to, portray, nero, in, a, positive, light, an, aggadah, in, the, talmud, says, that, at, the, end, of, ad, 66, conflict, broke, out, between, greeks, and, jews, in, jerusalem, and, caesarea, according, to, the, talmud, during, the, great, jewish, revolt, nero, went, to, jerusalem, and, shot, arrows, in, all, four, directions, all, the, arrows, landed, in, the, city, he, then, asked, a, passing, child, to, repeat, the, verse, he, had, learned, that, day, the, child, responded, i, will, lay, my, vengeance, upon, edom, by, the, hand, of, my, people, israel, ezekiel, 25, 14, nero, became, terrified, believing, that, god, wanted, the, second, temple, to, be, destroyed, but, that, he, would, punish, the, one, to, carry, it, out, nero, said, he, desires, to, lay, waste, his, house, and, to, lay, the, blame, on, me, whereupon, he, fled, and, converted, to, judaism, to, avoid, such, retribution, vespasian, was, then, dispatched, to, put, down, the, rebellion, the, talmud, adds, that, the, sage, reb, meir, baal, haness, lived, in, the, time, of, the, mishnah, and, was, a, prominent, supporter, of, the, bar, kokhba, rebellion, against, roman, rule, rabbi, meir, was, considered, one, of, the, greatest, of, the, tannaim, of, the, third, generation, 139, 163, according, to, the, talmud, he, was, a, descendant, of, nero, who, had, converted, to, judaism, his, wife, bruriah, is, one, of, the, few, women, cited, in, the, gemara, he, is, the, third, most, frequently, mentioned, sage, in, the, mishnah, the, talmudic, legend, about, nero, is, not, supported, by, contemporary, sources, roman, and, greek, sources, nowhere, report, nero, s, alleged, trip, to, jerusalem, or, his, alleged, conversion, to, judaism, there, is, also, no, record, of, nero, having, any, offspring, who, survived, infancy, his, only, recorded, child, claudia, augusta, died, aged, 4, months, tacitus, describes, nero, extensively, torturing, and, executing, christians, after, the, fire, of, ad, 64, suetonius, also, mentions, nero, punishing, christians, though, he, does, so, because, they, are, given, to, a, new, and, mischievous, superstition, and, does, not, connect, it, with, the, fire, christian, writer, tertullian, c, 155, 230, was, the, first, to, call, nero, the, first, persecutor, of, christians, he, wrote, examine, your, records, there, you, will, find, that, nero, was, the, first, that, persecuted, this, doctrine, lactantius, c, 240, 320, also, said, that, nero, first, persecuted, the, servants, of, god, as, did, sulpicius, severus, however, suetonius, writes, that, since, the, jews, constantly, made, disturbances, at, the, instigation, of, chrestus, the, expelled, them, from, rome, iudaeos, impulsore, chresto, assidue, tumultuantis, roma, expulit, these, expelled, jews, may, have, been, early, christians, although, suetonius, is, not, explicit, nor, is, the, bible, explicit, calling, aquila, of, pontus, and, his, wife, priscilla, both, expelled, from, italy, at, the, time, jews, acts, 18, 2, the, first, text, to, suggest, that, nero, ordered, the, execution, of, an, apostle, is, a, letter, by, clement, to, the, corinthians, traditionally, dated, to, around, ad, 96, the, apocryphal, ascension, of, isaiah, a, christian, writing, from, the, 2nd, century, says, the, slayer, of, his, mother, who, himself, even, this, king, will, persecute, the, plant, which, the, twelve, apostles, of, the, beloved, have, planted, of, the, twelve, one, will, be, delivered, into, his, hands, this, is, interpreted, as, referring, to, nero, bishop, eusebius, of, caesarea, c, 275, 339, was, the, first, to, write, explicitly, that, paul, was, beheaded, and, peter, crucified, in, rome, during, the, reign, of, nero, he, states, that, nero, s, persecution, led, to, peter, and, paul, s, deaths, but, that, nero, did, not, give, any, specific, orders, however, several, other, accounts, going, back, to, the, first, century, have, paul, surviving, his, two, years, in, rome, and, travelling, to, hispania, before, facing, trial, in, rome, again, prior, to, his, death, peter, is, first, said, to, have, been, crucified, specifically, upside, down, in, rome, during, nero, s, reign, but, not, by, nero, in, the, apocryphal, acts, of, peter, c, 200, the, account, ends, with, paul, still, alive, and, nero, abiding, by, god, s, command, not, to, persecute, any, more, christians, by, the, fourth, century, a, number, of, writers, were, stating, that, nero, killed, peter, and, paul, the, sibylline, oracles, book, 5, and, 8, written, in, the, second, century, speak, of, nero, returning, and, bringing, destruction, within, christian, communities, these, writings, along, with, others, fueled, the, belief, that, nero, would, return, as, the, antichrist, in, 310, lactantius, wrote, that, nero, suddenly, disappeared, and, even, the, burial, place, of, that, noxious, wild, beast, was, nowhere, to, be, seen, this, has, led, some, persons, of, extravagant, imagination, to, suppose, that, having, been, conveyed, to, a, distant, region, he, is, still, reserved, alive, and, to, him, they, apply, the, sibylline, verses, lactantius, maintains, that, it, is, not, right, to, believe, this, in, 422, augustine, of, hippo, wrote, about, 2, thessalonians, 2, 1, 11, where, he, believed, that, paul, mentioned, the, coming, of, the, antichrist, although, he, rejects, the, theory, augustine, mentions, that, many, christians, believed, nero, was, the, antichrist, or, would, return, as, the, antichrist, he, wrote, that, in, saying, for, the, mystery, of, iniquity, doth, already, work, he, alluded, to, nero, whose, deeds, already, seemed, to, be, as, the, deeds, of, antichrist, some, modern, biblical, scholars, such, as, delbert,
