december, 1804, at, 6, king, s, road, bedford, row, bloomsbury, london, the, second, child, and, eldest, son, of, isaac, d, israeli, a, literary, critic, and, historian, and, maria, miriam, n, e, basevi, the, family, was, mostly, from, italy, of, sephardic, jewish, mercantile, background, he, also, had, some, ashkenazi, jewish, ancestors, he, later, romanticised, his, origins, claiming, his, father, s, family, was, of, grand, iberian, and, venetian, descent, in, fact, isaac, s, family, was, of, no, great, distinction, but, on, disraeli, s, mother, s, side, in, which, he, took, no, interest, there, were, some, distinguished, forebears, including, isaac, cardoso, as, well, as, members, of, the, goldsmids, the, mocattas, and, the, montefiores, historians, differ, on, disraeli, s, motives, for, rewriting, his, family, history, bernard, glassman, argues, that, it, was, intended, to, give, him, status, comparable, to, that, of, england, s, ruling, elite, sarah, bradford, believes, his, dislike, of, the, commonplace, would, not, allow, him, to, accept, the, facts, of, his, birth, as, being, as, middle, class, and, undramatic, as, they, really, were, disraeli, s, siblings, were, sarah, naphtali, born, and, died, 1807, ralph, and, james, jem, he, was, close, to, his, sister, and, on, affectionate, but, more, distant, terms, with, his, surviving, brothers, details, of, his, schooling, are, sketchy, from, the, age, of, about, six, he, was, a, day, boy, at, a, dame, school, in, islington, which, one, of, his, biographers, described, as, for, those, days, a, very, high, class, establishment, two, years, later, or, so, the, exact, date, has, not, been, ascertained, he, was, sent, as, a, boarder, to, rev, john, potticary, s, school, at, blackheath, following, a, quarrel, in, 1813, with, the, bevis, marks, synagogue, his, father, renounced, judaism, and, had, the, four, children, baptised, into, the, church, of, england, in, july, and, august, 1817, isaac, d, israeli, had, never, taken, religion, very, seriously, but, had, remained, a, conforming, member, of, the, synagogue, his, father, benjamin, was, a, prominent, and, devout, member, it, was, probably, out, of, respect, for, him, that, isaac, did, not, leave, when, he, fell, out, with, the, synagogue, authorities, in, 1813, after, benjamin, senior, died, in, 1816, isaac, felt, free, to, leave, the, congregation, following, a, second, dispute, isaac, s, friend, sharon, turner, a, solicitor, convinced, him, that, although, he, could, comfortably, remain, unattached, to, any, formal, religion, it, would, be, disadvantageous, to, the, children, if, they, did, so, turner, stood, as, godfather, when, benjamin, was, baptised, aged, twelve, on, 31, july, 1817, conversion, enabled, disraeli, to, contemplate, a, career, in, politics, there, had, been, members, of, parliament, mps, from, jewish, families, since, sampson, gideon, in, 1770, however, until, the, jews, relief, act, 1858, mps, were, required, to, take, the, oath, of, allegiance, on, the, true, faith, of, a, christian, necessitating, at, least, nominal, conversion, it, is, not, known, whether, disraeli, formed, any, ambition, for, a, parliamentary, career, at, the, time, of, his, baptism, but, there, is, no, doubt, that, he, bitterly, regretted, his, parents, decision, not, to, send, him, to, winchester, college, one, of, the, great, public, schools, which, consistently, provided, recruits, to, the, political, elite, his, two, younger, brothers, were, sent, there, and, it, is, not, clear, why, isaac, chose, to, send, his, eldest, son, to, a, much, less, prestigious, school, the, boy, evidently, held, his, mother, responsible, for, the, decision, bradford, speculates, that, benjamin, s, delicate, health, and, his, obviously, jewish, appearance, may, have, had, something, to, do, with, it, the, school, chosen, for, him, was, run, by, eliezer, cogan, at, higham, hill, in, walthamstow, he, began, there, in, the, autumn, term, of, 1817, he, later, recalled, his, education, i, was, at, school, for, two, or, three, years, under, the, revd, dr, cogan, a, greek, scholar, of, eminence, who, had, contributed, notes, to, the, a, schylus, of, bishop, blomfield, was, himself, the, editor, of, the, greek, gnostic, poets, after, this, i, was, with, a, private, tutor, for, two, years, in, my, own, county, my, education, was, severely, classical, too, much, so, in, the, pride, of, boyish, erudition, i, edited, the, idonisian, eclogue, of, theocritus, wh, was, privately, printed, this, was, my, first, production, puerile, pedantry, in, november, 1821, shortly, before, his, seventeenth, birthday, disraeli, was, articled, as, a, clerk, to, a, firm, of, solicitors, swain, stevens, maples, pearse, and, hunt, in, the, city, of, london, t, f, maples, was, not, only, the, young, disraeli, s, employer, and, a, friend, of, his, father, s, but, also, his, prospective, father, in, law, isaac, and, maples, considered, that, the, latter, s, only, daughter, might, be, a, suitable, match, for, benjamin, a, friendship, developed, but, there, was, no, romance, the, firm, had, a, large, and, profitable, business, and, as, the, biographer, r, w, davis, observes, the, clerkship, was, the, kind, of, secure, respectable, position, that, many, fathers, dream, of, for, their, children, although, biographers, including, robert, blake, and, bradford, comment, that, such, a, post, was, incompatible, with, disraeli, s, romantic, and, ambitious, nature, he, reportedly, gave, his, employers, satisfactory, service, and, later, professed, to, have, learnt, a, good, deal, there, he, recalled, i, had, some, scruples, for, even, then, i, dreamed, of, parliament, my, father, s, refrain, always, was, philip, carteret, webb, who, was, the, most, eminent, solicitor, of, his, boyhood, and, who, was, an, mp, it, would, be, a, mistake, to, suppose, that, the, two, years, and, more, that, i, was, in, the, office, of, our, friend, were, wasted, i, have, often, thought, though, i, have, often, regretted, the, university, that, it, was, much, the, reverse, the, year, after, joining, maples, firm, benjamin, changed, his, surname, from, d, israeli, to, disraeli, his, reasons, are, unknown, but, the, biographer, bernard, glassman, surmises, that, it, was, to, avoid, being, confused, with, his, father, disraeli, s, sister, and, brothers, adopted, the, new, version, of, the, name, isaac, and, his, wife, retained, the, older, form, disraeli, toured, belgium, and, the, rhine, valley, with, his, father, in, the, summer, of, 1824, he, later, wrote, that, while, travelling, on, the, rhine, he, decided, to, abandon, his, position, i, determined, when, descending, those, magical, waters, that, i, would, not, be, a, lawyer, on, their, return, to, england, he, left, the, solicitors, at, the, suggestion, of, maples, with, the, aim, of, qualifying, as, a, barrister, he, enrolled, as, a, student, at, lincoln, s, inn, and, joined, the, chambers, of, his, uncle, nathaniel, basevy, and, then, those, of, benjamin, austen, who, persuaded, isaac, that, disraeli, would, never, make, a, barrister, and, should, be, allowed, to, pursue, a, literary, career, he, had, made, a, tentative, start, in, may, 1824, he, submitted, a, manuscript, to, his, father, s, friend, the, publisher, john, murray, but, withdrew, it, before, murray, could, decide, whether, to, publish, it, released, from, the, law, disraeli, did, some, work, for, murray, but, turned, most, of, his, attention, to, speculative, dealing, on, the, stock, exchange, there, was, at, the, time, a, boom, in, shares, in, south, american, mining, companies, spain, was, losing, its, south, american, colonies, in, the, face, of, rebellions, at, the, urging, of, george, canning, the, british, government, recognised, the, new, independent, governments, of, argentina, 1824, colombia, and, mexico, both, 1825, with, no, money, of, his, own, disraeli, borrowed, money, to, invest, he, became, involved, with, the, financier, j, d, powles, who, was, prominent, among, those, encouraging, the, mining, boom, in, 1825, disraeli, wrote, three, anonymous, pamphlets, for, powles, promoting, the, companies, the, pamphlets, were, published, by, john, murray, who, invested, heavily, in, the, boom, murray, had, ambitions, to, establish, a, new, morning, paper, to, compete, with, the, times, in, 1825, disraeli, convinced, him, that, he, should, proceed, the, new, paper, the, representative, promoted, the, mines, and, those, politicians, who, supported, them, particularly, canning, disraeli, impressed, murray, with, his, energy, and, commitment, to, the, project, but, he, failed, in, his, key, task, of, persuading, the, eminent, writer, john, gibson, lockhart, to, edit, the, paper, after, that, disraeli, s, influence, on, murray, waned, and, to, his, resentment, he, was, sidelined, in, the, affairs, of, the, representative, the, paper, survived, only, six, months, partly, because, the, mining, bubble, burst, in, late, 1825, and, partly, because, according, to, blake, the, paper, was, atrociously, edited, the, bursting, of, the, mining, bubble, was, ruinous, for, disraeli, by, june, 1825, he, and, his, business, partners, had, lost, 7, 000, disraeli, could, not, pay, off, the, last, of, his, debts, from, this, debacle, until, 1849, he, turned, to, writing, motivated, partly, by, his, desperate, need, for, money, and, partly, by, a, wish, for, revenge, on, murray, and, others, by, whom, he, felt, slighted, there, was, a, vogue, for, what, was, called, silver, fork, fiction, novels, depicting, aristocratic, life, usually, by, anonymous, authors, read, by, the, aspirational, middle, classes, disraeli, s, first, novel, vivian, grey, published, anonymously, in, four, volumes, in, 1826, 27, was, a, thinly, veiled, re, telling, of, the, affair, of, the, representative, it, sold, well, but, caused, much, offence, in, influential, circles, when, the, authorship, was, discovered, disraeli, then, just, 23, did, not, move, in, high, society, as, the, numerous, solecisms, in, his, book, made, obvious, reviewers, were, sharply, critical, on, these, grounds, of, both, the, author, and, the, book, murray, and, lockhart, men, of, great, influence, in, literary, circles, believed, that, disraeli, had, caricatured, them, and, abused, their, confidence, an, accusation, denied, by, the, author, but, repeated, by, many, of, his, biographers, in, later, editions, disraeli, made, many, changes, softening, his, satire, but, the, damage, to, his, reputation, proved, long, lasting, disraeli, s, biographer, jonathan, parry, writes, that, the, financial, failure, and, personal, criticism, that, disraeli, suffered, in, 1825, and, 1826, were, probably, the, trigger, for, a, serious, nervous, crisis, affecting, him, over, the, next, four, years, he, had, always, been, moody, sensitive, and, solitary, by, nature, but, now, became, seriously, depressed, and, lethargic, he, was, still, living, with, his, parents, in, london, but, in, search, of, the, change, of, air, recommended, by, the, family, s, doctors, isaac, took, a, succession, of, houses, in, the, country, and, on, the, coast, before, disraeli, sought, wider, horizons, together, with, his, sister, s, fianc, william, meredith, disraeli, travelled, widely, in, southern, europe, and, beyond, in, 1830, 31, the, trip, was, financed, partly, by, another, high, society, novel, the, young, duke, written, in, 1829, 30, the, tour, was, cut, short, suddenly, by, meredith, s, death, from, smallpox, in, cairo, in, july, 1831, despite, this, tragedy, and, the, need, for, treatment, for, a, sexually, transmitted, disease, on, his, return, disraeli, felt, enriched, by, his, experiences, he, became, in, parry, s, words, aware, of, values, that, seemed, denied, to, his, insular, countrymen, the, journey, encouraged, his, self, consciousness, his, moral, relativism, and, his, interest, in, eastern, racial, and, religious, attitudes, blake, regards, the, tour, as, one, of, the, formative, experiences, of, disraeli, s, career, he, impressions, that, it, made, on, him, were, life, lasting, they, conditioned, his, attitude, toward, some, of, the, most, important, political, problems, which, faced, him, in, his, later, years, especially, the, eastern, question, they, also, coloured, many, of, his, novels, disraeli, wrote, two, novels, in, the, aftermath, of, the, tour, contarini, fleming, 1832, was, avowedly, a, self, portrait, it, is, subtitled, a, psychological, autobiography, and, depicts, the, conflicting, elements, of, its, hero, s, character, the, duality, of, northern, and, mediterranean, ancestry, the, dreaming, artist, and, the, bold, man, of, action, as, parry, observes, the, book, ends, on, a, political, note, setting, out, europe, s, progress, from, feudal, to, federal, principles, the, wondrous, tale, of, alroy, the, following, year, portrayed, the, problems, of, a, medieval, jew, in, deciding, between, a, small, exclusively, jewish, state, and, a, large, empire, embracing, all, after, these, novels, were, published, disraeli, declared, that, he, would, write, no, more, about, myself, he, had, already, turned, his, attention, to, politics, in, 1832, during, the, great, crisis, over, the, reform, bill, he, contributed, to, an, anti, whig, pamphlet, edited, by, john, wilson, croker, and, published, by, murray, entitled, england, and, france, or, a, cure, for, ministerial, gallomania, the, choice, of, a, tory, publication, was, regarded, as, strange, by, disraeli, s, friends, and, relatives, who, thought, him, more, of, a, radical, indeed, he, had, objected, to, murray, about, croker, s, inserting, high, tory, sentiment, disraeli, remarked, it, is, quite, impossible, that, anything, adverse, to, the, general, measure, of, reform, can, issue, from, my, pen, moreover, at, the, time, gallomania, was, published, disraeli, was, electioneering, in, high, wycombe, in, the, radical, interest, disraeli, s, politics, at, the, time, were, influenced, both, by, his, rebellious, streak, and, his, desire, to, make, his, mark, at, that, time, british, politics, were, dominated, by, the, aristocracy, with, a, few, powerful, commoners, the, whigs, derived, from, the, coalition, of, lords, who, had, forced, through, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, and, in, some, cases, were, their, descendants, the, tories, tended, to, support, king, and, church, and, sought, to, thwart, political, change, a, small, number, of, radicals, generally, from, northern, constituencies, were, the, strongest, advocates, of, continuing, reform, in, the, early, 1830s, the, tories, and, the, interests, they, represented, appeared, to, be, a, lost, cause, the, other, great, party, the, whigs, were, anathema, to, disraeli, toryism, is, worn, out, i, cannot, condescend, to, be, a, whig, there, was, a, by, election, and, a, general, election, in, 1832, disraeli, unsuccessfully, stood, as, a, radical, at, high, wycombe, in, each, disraeli, s, political, views, embraced, certain, radical, policies, particularly, electoral, reform, and, also, some, tory, ones, including, protectionism, he, began, to, move, in, tory, circles, in, 1834, he, was, introduced, to, the, former, lord, chancellor, lord, lyndhurst, by, henrietta, sykes, wife, of, sir, francis, sykes, she, was, having, an, affair, with, lyndhurst, and, began, another, with, disraeli, disraeli, and, lyndhurst, took, an, immediate, liking, to, each, other, lyndhurst, was, an, indiscreet, gossip, with, a, fondness, for, intrigue, this, appealed, greatly, to, disraeli, who, became, his, secretary, and, go, between, in, 1835, disraeli, stood, for, the, last, time, as, a, radical, again, unsuccessfully, contesting, high, wycombe, in, april, 1835, disraeli, fought, a, by, election, at, taunton, as, a, tory, candidate, the, irish, mp, daniel, o, connell, misled, by, inaccurate, press, reports, thought, disraeli, had, slandered, him, while, electioneering, at, taunton, he, launched, an, outspoken, attack, referring, to, disraeli, as, a, reptile, just, fit, now, after, being, twice, discarded, by, the, people, to, become, a, conservative, he, possesses, all, the, necessary, requisites, of, perfidy, selfishness, depravity, want, of, principle, etc, which, would, qualify, him, for, the, change, his, name, shows, that, he, is, of, jewish, origin, i, do, not, use, it, as, a, term, of, reproach, there, are, many, most, respectable, jews, but, there, are, as, in, every, other, people, some, of, the, lowest, and, most, disgusting, grade, of, moral, turpitude, and, of, those, i, look, upon, mr, disraeli, as, the, worst, disraeli, s, public, exchanges, with, o, connell, extensively, reproduced, in, the, times, included, a, demand, for, a, duel, with, the, 60, year, old, o, connell, s, son, which, resulted, in, disraeli, s, temporary, detention, by, the, authorities, a, reference, to, the, inextinguishable, hatred, with, which, shall, pursue, existence, and, the, accusation, that, o, connell, s, supporters, had, a, princely, revenue, wrung, from, a, starving, race, of, fanatical, slaves, disraeli, was, highly, gratified, by, the, dispute, which, propelled, him, to, general, public, notice, for, the, first, time, he, did, not, defeat, the, incumbent, whig, member, henry, labouchere, but, the, taunton, constituency, was, regarded, as, unwinnable, by, the, tories, disraeli, kept, labouchere, s, majority, down, to, 170, a, good, showing, that, put, him, in, line, for, a, winnable, seat, in, the, near, future, with, lyndhurst, s, encouragement, disraeli, turned, to, writing, propaganda, for, his, newly, adopted, party, his, vindication, of, the, english, constitution, was, published, in, december, 1835, it, was, couched, in, the, form, of, an, open, letter, to, lyndhurst, and, in, bradford, s, view, encapsulates, a, political, philosophy, that, disraeli, adhered, to, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, value, of, benevolent, aristocratic, government, a, loathing, of, political, dogma, and, the, modernisation, of, tory, policies, the, following, year, he, wrote, a, series, of, satires, on, politicians, of, the, day, which, he, published, in, the, times, under, the, pen, name, runnymede, his, targets, included, the, whigs, collectively, and, individually, irish, nationalists, and, political, corruption, one, essay, ended, the, english, nation, therefore, rallies, for, rescue, from, the, degrading, plots, of, a, profligate, oligarchy, a, barbarizing, sectarianism, and, a, boroughmongering, papacy, round,

s, long, rambling, jumbling, speech, he, was, shouted, down, by, o, connell, s, supporters, after, this, unpromising, start, disraeli, kept, a, low, profile, for, the, rest, of, the, parliamentary, session, he, was, a, loyal, supporter, of, the, party, leader, sir, robert, peel, and, his, policies, with, the, exception, of, a, personal, sympathy, for, the, chartist, movement, that, most, tories,

my, money, his, wife, said, later, but, if, he, had, the, chance, again, he, would, marry, me, for, love, finding, the, financial, demands, of, his, maidstone, seat, too, much, disraeli, secured, a, tory, nomination, for, shrewsbury, winning, one, of, the, constituency, s, two, seats, at, the, 1841, general, election, despite, serious, opposition, and, heavy, debts, which, opponents, seized, on, the, election, was, a, massive, defeat, for, the, whigs, across, the, country, and, peel, became, prime, minister, disraeli, hoped, unrealistically, for, ministerial, office, though, disappointed, at, being, left, on, the, back, benches, he, continued, his, support, for, peel, in, 1842, and, 1843, seeking, to, establish, himself, as, an, expert, on, foreign, affairs, and, international, trade, although, a, tory, or, conservative, as, some, in, the, party, now, called, themselves, disraeli, was, sympathetic, to, some, of, the, aims, of, chartism, and, argued, for, an, alliance, between, the, landed, aristocracy, and, the, working, class, against, the, increasing, power, of, the, merchants, and, new, industrialists, in, the, middle, class, after, disraeli, won, widespread, acclaim, in, march, 1842, for, worsting, lord, palmerston, in, debate, he, was, taken, up, by, a, small, group, of, idealistic, new, tory, mps, with, whom, he, formed, the, young, england, group, they, held, that, the, landed, interests, should, use, their, power, to, protect, the, poor, from, exploitation, by, middle, class, businessmen, disraeli, hoped, to, forge, a, paternalistic, tory, radical, alliance, but, he, was, unsuccessful, before, the, reform, act, 1867, the, working, class, did, not, possess, the, vote, and, therefore, had, little, political, power, although, disraeli, forged, a, personal, friendship, with, john, bright, a, leading, radical, disraeli, was, unable, to, persuade, bright, to, sacrifice, his, distinct, position, for, parliamentary, advancement, when, disraeli, attempted, to, secure, a, tory, radical, cabinet, in, 1852, bright, refused, disraeli, gradually, became, a, sharp, critic, of, peel, s, government, often, deliberately, taking, contrary, positions, the, young, mp, attacked, his, leader, as, early, as, 1843, however, the, best, known, of, these, stances, were, over, the, maynooth, grant, in, 1845, and, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, the, president, of, the, board, of, trade, william, gladstone, resigned, from, the, cabinet, over, the, maynooth, grant, the, corn, laws, imposed, a, tariff, on, imported, wheat, protecting, british, farmers, from, foreign, competition, but, making, the, cost, of, bread, artificially, high, peel, hoped, that, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, and, the, resultant, influx, of, cheaper, wheat, into, britain, would, relieve, the, condition, of, the, poor, and, in, particular, the, great, famine, caused, by, successive, failure, of, potato, crops, in, ireland, the, first, months, of, 1846, were, dominated, by, a, battle, in, parliament, between, the, free, traders, and, the, protectionists, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, with, the, latter, rallying, around, disraeli, and, lord, george, bentinck, an, alliance, of, free, trade, conservatives, the, peelites, radicals, and, whigs, carried, repeal, and, the, conservative, party, split, the, peelites, moved, towards, the, whigs, while, a, new, conservative, party, formed, around, the, protectionists, led, by, disraeli, bentinck, and, lord, stanley, later, lord, derby, the, split, in, the, tory, party, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, had, profound, implications, for, disraeli, s, political, career, almost, every, tory, politician, with, experience, of, office, followed, peel, leaving, the, rump, bereft, of, leadership, in, blake, s, words, found, himself, almost, the, only, figure, on, his, side, capable, of, putting, up, the, oratorical, display, essential, for, a, parliamentary, leader, the, duke, of, argyll, wrote, that, disraeli, was, like, a, subaltern, in, a, great, battle, where, every, superior, officer, was, killed, or, wounded, if, the, tory, party, could, muster, the, electoral, support, necessary, to, form, a, government, then, disraeli, now, seemed, to, be, guaranteed, high, office, but, with, a, group, of, men, who, possessed, little, or, no, official, experience, and, who, as, a, group, remained, personally, hostile, to, disraeli, in, the, event, the, tory, split, soon, had, the, party, out, of, office, not, regaining, power, until, 1852, the, conservatives, would, not, again, have, a, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, until, 1874, peel, successfully, steered, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, through, parliament, and, was, then, defeated, by, an, alliance, of, his, enemies, on, the, issue, of, irish, law, and, order, he, resigned, in, june, 1846, the, tories, remained, split, and, the, queen, sent, for, lord, john, russell, the, whig, leader, in, the, 1847, general, election, disraeli, stood, successfully, for, the, buckinghamshire, constituency, the, new, house, of, commons, had, more, conservative, than, whig, members, but, the, depth, of, the, tory, schism, enabled, russell, to, continue, to, govern, the, conservatives, were, led, by, bentinck, in, the, commons, and, stanley, in, the, lords, in, 1847, a, small, political, crisis, removed, bentinck, from, the, leadership, and, highlighted, disraeli, s, differences, with, his, own, party, in, that, year, s, general, election, lionel, de, rothschild, had, been, returned, for, the, city, of, london, as, a, practising, jew, he, could, not, take, the, oath, of, allegiance, in, the, prescribed, christian, form, and, therefore, could, not, take, his, seat, lord, john, russell, the, whig, leader, who, had, succeeded, peel, as, prime, minister, proposed, in, the, commons, that, the, oath, should, be, amended, to, permit, jews, to, enter, parliament, disraeli, spoke, in, favour, of, the, measure, arguing, that, christianity, was, completed, judaism, and, asking, the, house, of, commons, where, is, your, christianity, if, you, do, not, believe, in, their, judaism, russell, and, disraeli, s, future, rival, gladstone, thought, this, brave, the, speech, was, badly, received, by, his, own, party, the, tories, and, the, anglican, establishment, were, hostile, to, the, bill, with, the, exception, of, disraeli, every, member, of, the, future, protectionist, cabinet, then, in, parliament, voted, against, the, measure, the, measure, was, voted, down, in, the, aftermath, of, the, debate, bentinck, resigned, the, leadership, and, was, succeeded, by, lord, granby, disraeli, s, speech, thought, by, many, of, his, own, party, to, be, blasphemous, ruled, him, out, for, the, time, being, while, these, intrigues, played, out, disraeli, was, working, with, the, bentinck, family, to, secure, the, necessary, financing, to, purchase, hughenden, manor, in, buckinghamshire, the, possession, of, a, country, house, and, incumbency, of, a, county, constituency, were, regarded, as, essential, for, a, tory, with, leadership, ambitions, disraeli, and, his, wife, alternated, between, hughenden, and, several, homes, in, london, for, the, rest, of, their, marriage, the, negotiations, were, complicated, by, bentinck, s, sudden, death, on, 21, september, 1848, but, disraeli, obtained, a, loan, of, 25, 000, from, bentinck, s, brothers, lord, henry, bentinck, and, lord, titchfield, within, a, month, of, his, appointment, granby, resigned, the, leadership, in, the, commons, and, the, party, functioned, without, a, leader, in, the, commons, for, the, rest, of, the, session, at, the, start, of, the, next, session, affairs, were, handled, by, a, triumvirate, of, granby, disraeli, and, john, charles, herries, indicative, of, the, tension, between, disraeli, and, the, rest, of, the, party, who, needed, his, talents, but, mistrusted, him, this, confused, arrangement, ended, with, granby, s, resignation, in, 1851, disraeli, effectively, ignored, the, two, men, regardless, in, march, 1851, lord, john, russell, s, government, was, defeated, over, a, bill, to, equalise, the, county, and, borough, franchises, mostly, because, of, divisions, among, his, supporters, he, resigned, and, the, queen, sent, for, stanley, who, felt, that, a, minority, government, could, do, little, and, would, not, last, long, so, russell, remained, in, office, disraeli, regretted, this, hoping, for, an, opportunity, however, brief, to, show, himself, capable, in, office, stanley, in, contrast, deprecated, his, inexperienced, followers, as, a, reason, for, not, assuming, office, these, are, not, names, i, can, put, before, the, queen, at, the, end, of, june, 1851, stanley, succeeded, to, the, title, of, earl, of, derby, the, whigs, were, wracked, by, internal, dissensions, during, the, second, half, of, 1851, much, of, which, parliament, spent, in, recess, russell, dismissed, lord, palmerston, from, the, cabinet, leaving, the, latter, determined, to, deprive, the, prime, minister, of, office, palmerston, did, so, within, weeks, of, parliament, s, reassembly, on, 4, february, 1852, his, followers, combining, with, disraeli, s, tories, to, defeat, the, government, on, a, militia, bill, and, russell, resigned, derby, had, either, to, take, office, or, risk, damage, to, his, reputation, and, he, accepted, the, queen, s, commission, as, prime, minister, palmerston, declined, any, office, derby, had, hoped, to, have, him, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, disraeli, his, closest, ally, was, his, second, choice, and, accepted, though, disclaiming, any, great, knowledge, in, the, financial, field, gladstone, refused, to, join, the, government, disraeli, may, have, been, attracted, to, the, office, by, the, 5, 000, annual, salary, which, would, help, pay, his, debts, few, of, the, new, cabinet, had, held, office, before, when, derby, tried, to, inform, the, duke, of, wellington, of, the, names, of, the, ministers, the, old, duke, who, was, somewhat, deaf, inadvertently, branded, the, new, government, by, incredulously, repeating, who, who, in, the, following, weeks, disraeli, served, as, leader, of, the, house, with, derby, as, prime, minister, in, the, lords, and, as, chancellor, he, wrote, regular, reports, on, proceedings, in, the, commons, to, victoria, who, described, them, as, very, curious, and, much, in, the, style, of, his, books, parliament, was, prorogued, on, 1, july, 1852, as, the, tories, could, not, govern, for, long, as, a, minority, disraeli, hoped, that, they, would, gain, a, majority, of, about, 40, instead, the, election, later, that, month, had, no, clear, winner, and, the, derby, government, held, to, power, pending, the, meeting, of, parliament, disraeli, s, task, as, chancellor, was, to, devise, a, budget, which, would, satisfy, the, protectionist, elements, who, supported, the, tories, without, uniting, the, free, traders, against, it, his, proposed, budget, which, he, presented, to, the, commons, on, 3, december, lowered, the, taxes, on, malt, and, tea, provisions, designed, to, appeal, to, the, working, class, to, make, his, budget, revenue, neutral, as, funds, were, needed, to, provide, defences, against, the, french, he, doubled, the, house, tax, and, continued, the, income, tax, disraeli, s, overall, purpose, was, to, enact, policies, which, would, benefit, the, working, classes, making, his, party, more, attractive, to, them, although, the, budget, did, not, contain, protectionist, features, the, opposition, was, prepared, to, destroy, it, and, disraeli, s, career, as, chancellor, in, part, out, of, revenge, for, his, actions, against, peel, in, 1846, mp, sidney, herbert, predicted, that, the, budget, would, fail, because, jews, make, no, converts, disraeli, delivered, the, budget, on, 3, december, 1852, and, prepared, to, wind, up, the, debate, for, the, government, on, 16, december, it, was, customary, for, the, chancellor, to, have, the, last, word, a, massive, defeat, for, the, government, was, predicted, disraeli, attacked, his, opponents, individually, and, then, as, a, force, i, face, a, coalition, this, too, i, know, that, england, does, not, love, coalitions, his, speech, of, three, hours, was, quickly, seen, as, a, parliamentary, masterpiece, as, mps, prepared, to, divide, gladstone, rose, to, his, feet, and, began, an, angry, speech, despite, the, efforts, of, tory, mps, to, shout, him, down, the, interruptions, were, fewer, as, gladstone, gained, control, of, the, house, and, in, the, next, two, hours, painted, a, picture, of, disraeli, as, frivolous, and, his, budget, as, subversive, the, government, was, defeated, by, 19, votes, and, derby, resigned, four, days, later, he, was, replaced, by, the, peelite, earl, of, aberdeen, with, gladstone, as, his, chancellor, because, of, disraeli, s, unpopularity, among, the, peelites, no, party, reconciliation, was, possible, while, he, remained, tory, leader, in, the, commons, with, the, fall, of, the, government, disraeli, and, the, conservatives, returned, to, the, opposition, benches, disraeli, would, spend, three, quarters, of, his, 44, year, parliamentary, career, in, opposition, derby, was, reluctant, to, seek, to, unseat, the, government, fearing, a, repetition, of, the, who, who, ministry, and, knowing, that, shared, dislike, of, disraeli, was, part, of, what, had, formed, the, governing, coalition, disraeli, on, the, other, hand, was, anxious, to, return, to, office, in, the, interim, disraeli, as, conservative, leader, in, the, commons, opposed, the, government, on, all, major, measures, in, june, 1853, disraeli, was, awarded, an, honorary, degree, by, the, university, of, oxford, he, had, been, recommended, for, it, by, lord, derby, the, university, s, chancellor, the, start, of, the, crimean, war, in, 1854, caused, a, lull, in, party, politics, disraeli, spoke, patriotically, in, support, the, british, military, efforts, were, marked, by, bungling, and, in, 1855, a, restive, parliament, considered, a, resolution, to, establish, a, committee, on, the, conduct, of, the, war, the, aberdeen, government, made, this, a, motion, of, confidence, disraeli, led, the, opposition, to, defeat, the, government, 305, to, 148, aberdeen, resigned, and, the, queen, sent, for, derby, who, to, disraeli, s, frustration, refused, to, take, office, palmerston, was, deemed, essential, to, any, whig, ministry, and, he, would, not, join, any, he, did, not, head, the, queen, reluctantly, asked, palmerston, to, form, a, government, under, palmerston, the, war, went, better, and, was, ended, by, the, treaty, of, paris, in, early, 1856, disraeli, was, early, to, call, for, peace, but, had, little, influence, on, events, when, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, india, in, 1857, disraeli, took, a, keen, interest, having, been, a, member, of, a, select, committee, in, 1852, which, considered, how, best, to, rule, the, subcontinent, and, had, proposed, eliminating, the, governing, role, of, the, british, east, india, company, after, peace, was, restored, and, palmerston, in, early, 1858, brought, in, legislation, for, direct, rule, of, india, by, the, crown, disraeli, opposed, it, many, conservative, mps, refused, to, follow, him, and, the, bill, passed, the, commons, easily, palmerston, s, grip, on, the, premiership, was, weakened, by, his, response, to, the, orsini, affair, in, which, an, attempt, was, made, to, assassinate, the, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, by, an, italian, revolutionary, with, a, bomb, made, in, birmingham, at, the, request, of, the, french, ambassador, palmerston, proposed, amending, the, conspiracy, to, murder, statute, to, make, creating, an, infernal, device, a, felony, he, was, defeated, by, 19, votes, on, the, second, reading, with, many, liberals, crossing, the, aisle, against, him, he, immediately, resigned, and, lord, derby, returned, to, office, derby, took, office, at, the, head, of, a, purely, conservative, administration, not, in, coalition, he, again, offered, a, place, to, gladstone, who, declined, disraeli, was, once, more, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, and, returned, to, the, exchequer, as, in, 1852, derby, led, a, minority, government, dependent, on, the, division, of, its, opponents, for, survival, as, leader, of, the, house, disraeli, resumed, his, regular, reports, to, queen, victoria, who, had, requested, that, he, include, what, she, could, not, meet, in, newspapers, during, its, brief, life, of, just, over, a, year, the, derby, government, proved, moderately, progressive, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, ended, the, role, of, the, east, india, company, in, governing, the, subcontinent, the, thames, purification, bill, funded, the, construction, of, much, larger, sewers, for, london, disraeli, had, supported, efforts, to, allow, jews, to, sit, in, parliament, with, a, bill, passed, through, the, commons, allowing, each, house, of, parliament, to, determine, what, oaths, its, members, should, take, this, was, grudgingly, agreed, to, by, the, house, of, lords, with, a, minority, of, conservatives, joining, with, the, opposition, to, pass, it, in, 1858, baron, lionel, de, rothschild, became, the, first, mp, to, profess, the, jewish, faith, faced, with, a, vacancy, disraeli, and, derby, tried, yet, again, to, bring, gladstone, still, nominally, a, conservative, mp, into, the, government, hoping, to, strengthen, it, disraeli, wrote, a, personal, letter, to, gladstone, asking, him, to, place, the, good, of, the, party, above, personal, animosity, every, man, performs, his, office, and, there, is, a, power, greater, than, ourselves, that, disposes, of, all, this, in, response, gladstone, denied, that, personal, feelings, played, any, role, in, his, decisions, then, and, previously, whether, to, accept, office, while, acknowledging, that, there, were, differences, between, him, and, derby, broader, than, you, may, have, supposed, the, tories, pursued, a, reform, bill, in, 1859, which, would, have, resulted, in, a, modest, increase, to, the, franchise, the, liberals, were, healing, the, breaches, between, those, who, favoured, russell, and, the, palmerston, loyalists, and, in, late, march, 1859, the, government, was, defeated, on, a, russell, sponsored, amendment, derby, dissolved, parliament, and, the, ensuing, general, election, resulted, in, modest, tory, gains, but, not, enough, to, control, the, commons, when, parliament, assembled, derby, s, government, was, defeated, by, 13, votes, on, an, amendment, to, the, address, from, the, throne, he, resigned, and, the, queen, reluctantly, sent, for, palmerston, again, after, derby, s, second, ejection, from, office, disraeli, faced, dissension, within, conservative, ranks, from, those, who, blamed, him, for, the, defeat, or, who, felt, he, was, disloyal, to, derby, the, former, prime, minister, warned, disraeli, of, some, mps, seeking, his, removal, from, the, front, bench, among, the, conspirators, were, lord, robert, cecil, a, conservative, mp, who, would, a, quarter, century, later, become, prime, minister, as, lord, salisbury, he, wrote, that, having, disraeli, as, leader, in, the, commons, decreased, the, conservatives, chance, of, holding, office, when, cecil, s, father, objected, lord, robert, stated, i, have, merely, put, into, print, what, all, the, country, gentlemen, were, saying, in, private, disraeli, led, a, toothless, opposition, in, the, commons, seeing, no, way, of, unseating, palmerston, derby, privately, agreed, not, to, seek, the, government, s, defeat, disraeli, kept, himself, informed, on, foreign, affairs, and, on, what, was, going, on, in, cabinet, thanks, to, a, source, within, it, when, the, american, civil, war, began, in, 1861, disraeli, said, little, publicly, but, like, most, englishmen, expected, the, south, to, win, less, reticent, were, palmerston, gladstone, and, russell, whose, statements, in, support, of, the, south, contributed, to, years, of, hard, feelings, in, the, united, states, in, 1862, disraeli, met, prussian, count, otto, von, bismarck, and, said, of, him, be, careful, about, that, man, he, means, what, he, says, the, party, truce, ended, in, 1864, with, tories, outraged, over, palmerston, s, handling, of, the, territorial, dispute, between, the, german, confederation, and, denmark, known, as, the, schleswig, holstein, question, disraeli, had, little, help, from, derby, who, was, ill, but, he, united, the, party, enough, on, a, no, confidence, vote, to, limit, the, government, to, a, majority, of, 18, tory, defections, and, absentees, kept, palmerston, in, office, despite, rumours, about, palmerston, s, health, as, he, turned, 80, he, remained, personally, popular, and, the, liberals, increased, their, margin, in, the, july, 1865, general, election, in, the, wake, of, the, poor, election, results, derby, predicted, to, disraeli, that, neither, of, them, would, ever, hold, office, again, political, plans, were, thrown, into, disarray, by, palmerston, s, death, on, 18, october, 1865, russell, became, prime, minister, again, with, gladstone, clearly, the, liberal, party, s, leader, in, waiting, and, as, leader, of, the, house, disraeli, s, direct, opponent, one, of, russell, s, early, priorities, was, a, reform, bill, but, the, proposed, legislation, that, gladstone, announced, on, 12, march, 1866, divided, his, party, the, conservatives, and, the, dissident, liberals, repeatedly, attacked, gladstone, s, bill, and, in, june, finally, defeated, the, government, russell, resigned, on, 26, june, the, dissidents, were, unwilling, to, serve, under, disraeli, in, the, house, of, commons, and, derby, formed, a, third, conservative, minority, government, with, disraeli, again, as, chancellor, it, was, disraeli, s, belief, that, if, given, the, vote, british, people, would, use, it, instinctively, to, put, their, natural, and, traditional, rulers, the, gentlemen, of, the, conservative, party, into, power, responding, to, renewed, agitation, for, popular, suffrage, disraeli, persuaded, a, majority, of, the, cabinet, to, agree, to, a, reform, bill, with, what, derby, cautioned, was, a, leap, in, the, dark, disraeli, had, outflanked, the, liberals, who, as, the, supposed, champions, of, reform, dared, not, oppose, him, in, the, absence, of, a, credible, party, rival, and, for, fear, of, having, an, election, called, on, the, issue, conservatives, felt, obliged, to, support, disraeli, despite, their, misgivings, there, were, tory, dissenters, most, notably, lord, cranborne, as, robert, cecil, was, by, then, known, who, resigned, from, the, government, and, spoke, against, the, bill, accusing, disraeli, of, a, political, betrayal, which, has, no, parallel, in, our, parliamentary, annals, even, as, disraeli, accepted, liberal, amendments, although, pointedly, refusing, those, moved, by, gladstone, that, further, lowered, the, property, qualification, cranborne, was, unable, to, lead, an, effective, rebellion, disraeli, gained, wide, acclaim, and, became, a, hero, to, his, party, for, the, marvellous, parliamentary, skill, with, which, he, secured, the, passage, of, reform, in, the, commons, from, the, liberal, benches, too, there, was, admiration, mp, for, nottingham, bernal, ostborne, declared, i, have, always, thought, the, chancellor, of, exchequer, was, the, greatest, radical, in, the, house, he, has, achieved, what, no, other, man, in, the, country, could, have, done, he, has, lugged, up, that, great, omnibus, full, of, stupid, heavy, country, gentlemen, i, only, say, stupid, in, the, parliamentary, sense, and, has, converted, these, conservative, into, radical, reformers, the, reform, act, 1867, passed, that, august, it, extended, the, franchise, by, 938, 427, men, an, increase, of, 88, by, giving, the, vote, to, male, householders, and, male, lodgers, paying, at, least, 10, for, rooms, it, eliminated, rotten, boroughs, with, fewer, than, 10, 000, inhabitants, and, granted, constituencies, to, 15, unrepresented, towns, with, extra, representation, to, large, municipalities, such, as, liverpool, and, manchester, derby, had, long, had, attacks, of, gout, which, left, him, bedbound, unable, to, deal, with, politics, as, the, new, session, of, parliament, approached, in, february, 1868, he, was, unable, to, leave, his, home, but, was, reluctant, to, resign, as, at, 68, he, was, much, younger, than, either, palmerston, or, russell, at, the, end, of, their, premierships, derby, knew, that, his, attacks, of, illness, would, at, no, distant, period, incapacitate, me, from, the, discharge, of, my, public, duties, doctors, had, warned, him, that, his, health, required, his, resignation, in, late, february, with, parliament, in, session, and, derby, absent, he, wrote, to, disraeli, asking, for, confirmation, that, you, will, not, shrink, from, the, additional, heavy, responsibility, reassured, he, wrote, to, the, queen, resigning, and, recommending, disraeli, as, only, he, could, command, the, cordial, support, en, masse, of, his, present, colleagues, disraeli,

fiction, by, a, former, prime, minister, was, a, novelty, for, britain, and, the, book, became, a, bestseller, by, 1872, there, was, dissent, in, the, conservative, ranks, over, the, failure, to, challenge, gladstone, this, was, quieted, as, disraeli, took, steps, to, assert, his, leadership, and, as, divisions, among, the, liberals, became, clear, public, support, for, disraeli, was, shown, by, cheering, at, a, thanksgiving, service, in, 1872, on, the, recovery, of, the, prince, of, wales, from, illness, while, gladstone, was, met, with, silence, disraeli, had, supported, the, efforts,

almost, thirty, years, with, only, brief, spells, in, government, disraeli, gave, positions, to, hard, up, conservative, leaders, even, to, gladstone, s, outrage, creating, one, office, at, 2, 000,

vacant, disraeli, reluctantly, agreed, to, the, queen, s, preferred, candidate, archibald, tait, the, bishop, of, london, to, fill, tait, s, vacant, see, disraeli, was, urged, by, many, people, to, appoint, samuel, wilberforce, the, former, bishop, of, winchester, disraeli, disliked, wilberforce, and, instead, appointed, john, jackson, the, bishop, of, lincoln, blake, suggested, that, on, balance, these, appointments, cost, disraeli, more, votes, than, they, gained, him, disraeli, always, considered, foreign, affairs, to, be, the, most, critical, and, interesting, part, of, statesmanship, nevertheless, his, biographer, robert, blake, doubts, that, his, subject, had, specific, ideas, about, foreign, policy, when, he, took, office, in, 1874, he, had, rarely, travelled, abroad, since, his, youthful, tour, of, the, middle, east, in, 1830, 1831, he, had, left, britain, only, for, his, honeymoon, and, three, visits, to, paris, the, last, of, which, was, in, 1856, as, he, had, criticised, gladstone, for, a, do, nothing, foreign, policy, he, most, probably, contemplated, what, actions, would, reassert, britain, s, place, in, europe, his, brief, first, premiership, and, the, first, year, of, his, second, gave, him, little, opportunity, to, make, his, mark, in, foreign, affairs, the, suez, canal, opened, in, 1869, cut, weeks, and, thousands, of, miles, off, the,

ottoman, empire, as, in, the, crimea, the, issue, of, the, canal, raised, the, eastern, question, of, what, to, do, about, the, decaying, empire, governed, from, constantinople, with, much, of, the, pre, canal, trade, and, communications, between, britain, and, india, passing, through, the, ottoman, empire, britain, had, done, its, best, to, prop, up, the, ottomans, against, the, threat, that, russia, would, take, constantinople, cutting, those, communications, and, giving, russian, ships, unfettered, access, to, the, mediterranean, the, french, might, also, threaten, those, lines, britain, had, had, the, opportunity, to, purchase, shares, in, the, canal, but, had, declined, to, do, so, disraeli, sent, the, liberal, mp, nathan, rothschild, to, paris, to, enquire, about, buying, de, lesseps, s, shares, on, 14, november, 1875, the, editor, of, the, pall, mall, gazette, frederick, greenwood, learnt, from, london, banker, henry, oppenheim, that, the, khedive, was, seeking, to, sell, his, shares, in, the, suez, canal, company, to, a, french, firm, greenwood, quickly, told, lord, derby, the, foreign, secretary, who, notified, disraeli, the, prime, minister, moved, immediately, to, secure, the, shares, on, 23, november, the, khedive, offered, to, sell, the, shares, for, 100, 000, 000, francs, rather, than, seek, the, aid, of, the, bank, of, england, disraeli, borrowed, funds, from, lionel, de, rothschild, who, took, a, commission, on, the, deal, the, banker, s, capital, was, at, risk, as, parliament, could, have, refused, to, ratify, the, transaction, the, contract, for, purchase, was, signed, at, cairo, on, 25, november, and, the, shares, deposited, at, the, british, consulate, the, following, day, disraeli, told, the, queen, it, is, settled, you, have, it, madam, the, public, saw, the, venture, as, a, daring, statement, of, british, dominance, of, the, seas, sir, ian, malcolm, described, the, suez, canal, share, purchase, as, the, greatest, romance, of, mr,

egypt, in, 1882, a, later, foreign, secretary, lord, curzon, described, the, canal, in, 1909, as, the, determining, influence, of, every, considerable, movement, of, british, power, to, the, east, and, south, of, the, mediterranean, although, initially, curious, about, disraeli, when, he, entered, parliament, in, 1837, victoria, came, to, detest, him, over, his, treatment, of, peel, over, time, her, dislike, softened, especially, as, disraeli, took, pains, to, cultivate, her, he, told, matthew, arnold, everybody, likes, flattery, and, when, you, come, to, royalty, you, should, lay, it, on, with, a, trowel, disraeli, s, biographer, adam, kirsch, suggests, that, disraeli, s, obsequious, treatment, of, his, queen, was, part, flattery, part, belief, that, this, was, how, a, queen, should, be, addressed, by, a, loyal, subject, and, part, awe, that, a, middle, class, man, of, jewish, birth, should, be, the, companion, of, a, monarch, by, the, time, of, his, second, premiership, disraeli, had, built, a, strong, relationship, with, victoria, probably, closer, to, her, than, any, of, her, prime, ministers, except, her, first, lord, melbourne, when, disraeli, returned, as, prime, minister, in, 1874, and, went, to, kiss, hands, he, did, so, literally, on, one, knee, according, to, richard, aldous, in, his, book, on, the, rivalry, between, disraeli, and, gladstone, victoria, and, disraeli, would, exploit, their, closeness, for, mutual, advantage, victoria, had, long, wished, to, have, an, imperial, title, reflecting, britain, s, expanding, domain, she, was, irked, when, tsar, alexander, ii, held, a, higher, rank, than, her, as, an, emperor, and, was, appalled, that, her, daughter, the, prussian, crown, princess, would, outrank, her, when, her, husband, came, to, the, throne, she, also, saw, an, imperial, title, as, proclaiming, britain, s, increased, stature, in, the, world, the, title, empress, of, india, had, been, used, informally, for, some, time, and, she, wished, to, have, that, title, formally, bestowed, on, her, the, queen, prevailed, upon, disraeli, to, introduce, a, royal, titles, bill, and, also, told, of, her, intent, to, open, parliament, in, person, which, during, this, time, she, did, only, when, she, wanted, something, from, legislators, disraeli, was, cautious, in, response, as, careful, soundings, of, mps, brought, a, negative, reaction, and, he, declined, to, place, such, a, proposal, in, the, queen, s, speech, once, the, desired, bill, was, finally, prepared, disraeli, s, handling, of, it, was, not, adept, he, neglected, to, notify, either, the, prince, of, wales, or, the, opposition, and, was, met, by, irritation, from, the, prince, and, a, full, scale, attack, from, the, liberals, an, old, enemy, of, disraeli, former, liberal, chancellor, robert, lowe, alleged, during, the, debate, in, the, commons, that, two, previous, prime, ministers, had, refused, to, introduce, such, legislation, for, the, queen, gladstone, immediately, stated, that, he, was, not, one, of, them, and, the, queen, gave, disraeli, leave, to, quote, her, saying, she, had, never, approached, a, prime, minister, with, such, a, proposal, according, to, blake, disraeli, in, a, brilliant, oration, of, withering, invective, proceeded, to, destroy, lowe, who, apologised, and, never, held, office, again, disraeli, said, of, lowe, that, he, was, the, only, person, in, london, with, whom, he, would, not, shake, hands, he, is, in, the, mud, and, there, i, leave, him, fearful, of, losing, disraeli, was, reluctant, to, bring, the, bill, to, a, vote, in, the, commons, but, when, he, did, it, passed, with, a, majority, of, 75, once, the, bill, was, formally, enacted, victoria, began, signing, her, letters, victoria, r, i, latin, regina, et, imperatrix, queen, and, empress, according, to, aldous, the, bill, shattered, disraeli, s, authority, in, the, house, of, commons, in, july, 1875, serb, populations, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, then, provinces, of, the, ottoman, empire, revolted, against, the, turks, alleging, religious, persecution, and, poor, administration, the, following, january, sultan, abd, laziz, agreed, to, reforms, proposed, by, hungarian, statesman, julius, andr, ssy, but, the, rebels, suspecting, they, might, win, their, freedom, continued, their, uprising, joined, by, militants, in, serbia, and, bulgaria, the, turks, suppressed, the, bulgarian, uprising, harshly, and, when, reports, of, these, actions, escaped, disraeli, and, derby, stated, in, parliament, that, they, did, not, believe, them, disraeli, called, them, coffee, house, babble, and, dismissed, allegations, of, torture, by, the, ottomans, since, oriental, people, usually, terminate, their, connections, with, culprits, in, a, more, expeditious, fashion, gladstone, who, had, left, the, liberal, leadership, and, retired, from, public, life, was, appalled, by, reports, of, atrocities, in, bulgaria, and, in, august, 1876, penned, a, hastily, written, pamphlet, arguing, that, the, turks, should, be, deprived, of, bulgaria, because, of, what, they, had, done, there, he, sent, a, copy, to, disraeli, who, called, it, vindictive, and, ill, written, of, all, the, bulgarian, horrors, perhaps, the, greatest, gladstone, s, pamphlet, became, an, immense, best, seller, and, rallied, the, liberals, to, urge, that, the, ottoman, empire, should, no, longer, be, a, british, ally, disraeli, wrote, to, lord, salisbury, on, 3, september, had, it, not, been, for, these, unhappy, atrocities, we, should, have, settled, a, peace, very, honourable, to, england, and, satisfactory, to, europe, now, we, are, obliged, to, work, from, a, new, point, of, departure, and, dictate, to, turkey, who, has, forfeited, all, sympathy, in, spite, of, this, disraeli, s, policy, favoured, constantinople, and, ottoman, territorial, integrity, disraeli, and, the, cabinet, sent, salisbury, as, lead, british, representative, to, the, constantinople, conference, which, met, in, december, 1876, and, january, 1877, in, advance, of, the, conference, disraeli, sent, salisbury, private, word, to, seek, british, military, occupation, of, bulgaria, and, bosnia, and, british, control, of, the, ottoman, army, salisbury, ignored, these, instructions, which, his, biographer, andrew, roberts, deemed, ludicrous, the, conference, failed, to, reach, agreement, with, the, turks, parliament, opened, in, february, 1877, with, disraeli, now, in, the, lords, as, earl, of, beaconsfield, he, spoke, only, once, there, in, the, 1877, session, on, the, eastern, question, stating, on, 20, february, that, there, was, a, need, for, stability, in, the, balkans, and, that, forcing, turkey, into, territorial, concessions, would, not, secure, it, the, prime, minister, wanted, a, deal, with, the, ottomans, whereby, britain, would, temporarily, occupy, strategic, areas, to, deter, the, russians, from, war, to, be, returned, on, the, signing, of, a, peace, treaty, but, found, little, support, in, his, cabinet, which, favoured, partition, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, disraeli, by, then, in, poor, health, continued, to, battle, within, the, cabinet, russia, invaded, turkey, on, 21, april, beginning, the, russo, turkish, war, the, russians, pushed, through, ottoman, territory, and, by, december, 1877, had, captured, the, strategic, bulgarian, town, of, plevna, the, war, divided, the, british, but, the, russian, success, caused, some, to, forget, the, atrocities, and, call, for, intervention, on, the, turkish, side, others, hoped, for, further, russian, successes, the, fall, of, plevna, was, a, major, story, for, weeks, and, disraeli, s, warnings, that, russia, was, a, threat, to, british, interests, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, were, deemed, prophetic, the, jingoistic, attitude, of, many, britons, increased, disraeli, s, political, support, and, the, queen, showed, her, favour, by, visiting, him, at, hughenden, the, first, time, she, had, visited, the, country, home, of, her, prime, minister, since, the, melbourne, ministry, at, the, end, of, january, 1878, the, ottoman, sultan, appealed, to,

measure, but, less, than, half, his, party, voted, with, him, popular, opinion, was, with, disraeli, though, some, thought, him, too, soft, for, not, immediately, declaring, war, on, russia, with, the, russians, close, to, constantinople, the, turks, yielded, and, in, march, 1878, signed, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, conceding, a, bulgarian, state, covering, a, large, part, of, the, balkans,

of, cyprus, once, this, was, secretly, agreed, disraeli, was, prepared, to, allow, russia, s, territorial, gains, the, congress, of, berlin, was, held, in, june, and, july, 1878, the, central, relationship, in, it, that, between, disraeli, and, bismarck, in, later, years, the, german, chancellor, would, show, visitors, to, his, office, three, pictures, on, the, wall, the, portrait, of, my,

the, delegates, disraeli, s, awful, french, accent, told, disraeli, that, the, congress, was, hoping, to, hear, a, speech, in, english, by, one, of, its, masters, disraeli, left, much, of, the, detailed, work, to, salisbury, concentrating, his, efforts, on, making, it, as, difficult, as, possible, for, the, broken, up, big, bulgaria, to, reunite, disraeli, intended, that, batum, be, demilitarised, but, the, russians, obtained, their, preferred, language, and, in, 1886, fortified, the, town, nevertheless, the, cyprus, convention, ceding, the, island, to, britain, was, announced, during, the, congress, and, again, made, disraeli, a, sensation, disraeli, gained, agreement, that, turkey, should, retain, enough, of, its, european, possessions, to, safeguard, the, dardanelles, by,

the, congress, as, a, european, coalition, against, russia, under, bismarck, the, treaty, of, berlin, was, signed, on, 13, july, 1878, at, the, radziwill, palace, in, berlin, disraeli, and, salisbury,

brought, you, back, peace, but, a, peace, i, hope, with, honour, the, queen, offered, him, a, dukedom, which, he, declined, though, accepting, the, garter, as, long, as, salisbury, also, received, it,

country, until, the, sixth, year, unless, forced, to, by, events, only, four, and, a, half, years, had, passed, and, they, did, not, see, any, clouds, on, the, horizon, that, might, forecast, conservative, defeat, if, they, waited, this, decision, not, to, seek, re, election, has, often, been, cited, as, a, great, mistake, by, disraeli, blake, however, pointed, out, that, results, in, local, elections, had, been, moving, against, the, conservatives, and, doubted, if, disraeli, missed, any, great, opportunity, by, waiting, as, successful, invasions, of, india, generally, came, through, afghanistan, the, british, had, observed, and, sometimes, intervened, there, since, the, 1830s, hoping, to, keep, the, russians, out, in, 1878, the, russians, sent, a, mission, to, kabul, it, was, not, rejected, by, the, afghans, as, the, british, had, hoped, the, british, proposed, to, send, their, own, mission, insisting, that, the, russians, be, sent, away, the, viceroy, of, india, lord, lytton, concealed, his, plans, to, issue, this, ultimatum, from, disraeli, and, when, the, prime, minister, insisted, he, take, no, action, went, ahead, anyway, when, the, afghans, made, no,

be, accomplished, until, the, native, tribes, acknowledged, british, rule, made, demands, on, the, zulu, and, their, king, cetewayo, which, they, were, certain, to, reject, as, zulu, troops, could, not, marry, until, they, had, washed, their, spears, in, blood, they, were, eager, for, combat, frere, did, not, send, word, to, the, cabinet, of, what, he, had, done, until, the, ultimatum, was, about, to, expire, disraeli, and, the, cabinet, reluctantly, backed, him, and, in, early, january, 1879, resolved, to, send, reinforcements, before, they, could, arrive, on, 22, january, a, zulu,

afghan, soldiers, roberts, undertook, a, successful, punitive, expedition, against, the, afghans, over, the, next, six, weeks, in, december, 1878, gladstone, was, offered, the, liberal, nomination, for, edinburghshire, a, constituency, popularly, known, as, midlothian, the, small, scottish, electorate, was, dominated, by, two, noblemen, the, conservative, duke, of, buccleuch, and, the, liberal, earl, of, rosebery, the, earl, a, friend, of, both, disraeli, and, gladstone, who, would, succeed, the, latter, after, his, final, term, as, prime, minister, had, journeyed, to, the, united, states, to, view, politics, there, and, was, convinced, that, aspects, of, american, electioneering, techniques, could, be, translated, to, britain, on, his, advice, gladstone, accepted, the, offer, in, january, 1879, and, later, that, year, began, his, midlothian, campaign, speaking, not, only, in, edinburgh, but, across, britain, attacking, disraeli, to, huge, crowds, conservative, chances, of, re, election, were, damaged, by, the, poor, weather, and, consequent, effects, on, agriculture, four, consecutive, wet, summers, through, 1879, had, led, to, poor, harvests, in, the, past, the, farmer, had, the, consolation, of, higher, prices, at, such, times, but, with, bumper, crops, cheaply, transported, from, the, united, states, grain, prices, remained, low, other, european, nations, faced, with, similar, circumstances, opted, for, protection, and, disraeli, was, urged, to, reinstitute, the, corn, laws, he, declined, stating, that, he, regarded, the, matter, as, settled, protection, would, have, been, highly, unpopular, among, the, newly, enfranchised, urban, working, classes, as, it, would, raise, their, cost, of, living, amid, an, economic, slump, generally, the, conservatives, lost, support, among, farmers, disraeli, s, health, continued, to, fail, through, 1879, owing, to, his, infirmities, disraeli, was, 45, minutes, late, for, the, lord, mayor, s, dinner, at, the, guildhall, in, november, at, which, it, is, customary, that, the, prime, minister, speaks, though, many, commented, on, how, healthy, he, looked, it, took, him, great, effort, to, appear, so, and, when, he, told, the, audience, he, expected, to, speak, to, the, dinner, again, the, following, year, attendees, chuckled, gladstone, was, then, in, the, midst, of, his, campaign, despite, his, public, confidence, disraeli, recognised, that, the, conservatives, would, probably, lose, the, next, election, and, was, already, contemplating, his, resignation, honours, despite, this, pessimism, conservatives, hopes, were, buoyed, in, early, 1880, with, successes, in, by, elections, the, liberals, had, expected, to, win, concluding, with, victory, in, southwark, normally, a, liberal, stronghold, the, cabinet, had, resolved, to, wait, before, dissolving, parliament, in, early, march, they, reconsidered, agreeing, to, go, to, the, country, as, soon, as, possible, parliament, was, dissolved, on, 24, march, the, first, borough, constituencies, began, voting, a, week, later, disraeli, took, no, public, part, in, the, electioneering, it, being, deemed, improper, for, peers, to, make, speeches, to, influence, commons, elections, this, meant, that, the, chief, conservatives, disraeli, salisbury, and, india, secretary, lord, cranbrook, would, not, be, heard, from, the, election, was, thought, likely, to, be, close, once, returns, began, to, be, announced, it, became, clear, that, the, conservatives, were, decisively, beaten, the, final, result, gave, the, liberals, an, absolute, majority, of, about, 50, disraeli, refused, to, cast, blame, for, the, defeat, which, he, understood, was, likely, to, be, final, for, him, he, wrote, to, lady, bradford, that, it, was, just, as, much, work, to, end, a, government, as, to, form, one, without, any, of, the, fun, queen, victoria, was, bitter, at, his, departure, among, the, honours, he, arranged, before, resigning, as, prime, minister, on, 21, april, 1880, was, one, for, his, private, secretary, montagu, corry, who, became, baron, rowton, returning, to, hughenden, disraeli, brooded, over, his, electoral, dismissal, but, also, resumed, work, on, endymion, which, he, had, begun, in, 1872, and, laid, aside, before, the, 1874, election, the, work, was, rapidly, completed, and, published, by, november, 1880, he, carried, on, a, correspondence, with, victoria, with, letters, passed, through, intermediaries, when, parliament, met, in, january, 1881, he, served, as, conservative, leader, in, the, lords, attempting, to, serve, as, a, moderating, influence, on, gladstone, s, legislation, because, of, his, asthma, and, gout, disraeli, went, out, as, little, as, possible, fearing, more, serious, episodes, of, illness, in, march, he, fell, ill, with, bronchitis, and, emerged, from, bed, only, for, a, meeting, with, salisbury, and, other, conservative, leaders, on, the, 26th, as, it, became, clear, that, this, might, be, his, final, sickness, friends, and, opponents, alike, came, to, call, disraeli, declined, a, visit, from, the, queen, saying, she, would, only, ask, me, to, take, a, message, to, albert, almost, blind, when, he, received, the, last, letter, from, victoria, of, which, he, was, aware, on, 5, april, he, held, it, momentarily, then, had, it, read, to, him, by, lord, barrington, a, privy, councillor, one, card, signed, a, workman, delighted, its, recipient, don, t, die, yet, we, can, t, do, without, you, despite, the, gravity, of, disraeli, s, condition, the, doctors, concocted, optimistic, bulletins, for, public, consumption, prime, minister, gladstone, called, several, times, to, enquire, about, his, rival, s, condition, and, wrote, in, his, diary, may, the, almighty, be, near, his, pillow, there, was, intense, public, interest, in, disraeli, s, struggles, for, life, disraeli, had, customarily, taken, the, sacrament, at, easter, when, this, day, was, observed, on, 17, april, there, was, discussion, among, his, friends, and, family, if, he, should, be, given, the, opportunity, but, those, against, fearing, that, he, would, lose, hope, prevailed, on, the, morning, of, the, following, day, easter, monday, he, became, incoherent, then, comatose, disraeli, s, last, confirmed, words, before, dying, at, his, home, at, 19, curzon, street, in, the, early, morning, of, 19, april, were, i, had, rather, live, but, i, am, not, afraid, to, die, the, anniversary, of, disraeli, s, death, was, for, some, years, commemorated, in, the, united, kingdom, as, primrose, day, despite, having, been, offered, a, state, funeral, by, queen, victoria, disraeli, s, executors, decided, against, a, public, procession, and, funeral, fearing, that, too, large, crowds, would, gather, to, do, him, honour, the, chief, mourners, at, the, service, at, hughenden, on, 26, april, were, his, brother, ralph, and, nephew, coningsby, to, whom, hughenden, would, eventually, pass, gathorne, gathorne, hardy, viscount, cranbrook, despite, most, of, disraeli, s, former, cabinet, being, present, was, notably, absent, in, italy, queen, victoria, was, prostrated, with, grief, and, considered, ennobling, ralph, or, coningsby, as, a, memorial, to, disraeli, without, children, his, titles, became, extinct, with, his, death, but, decided, against, it, on, the, ground, that, their, means, were, too, small, for, a, peerage, protocol, forbade, her, attending, disraeli, s, funeral, this, would, not, be, changed, until, 1965, when, elizabeth, ii, attended, the, rites, for, the, former, prime, minister, sir, winston, churchill, but, she, sent, primroses, his, favourite, flowers, to, the, funeral, and, visited, the, burial, vault, to, place, a, wreath, four, days, later, disraeli, is, buried, with, his, wife, in, a, vault, beneath, the, church, of, st, michael, and, all, angels, which, stands, in, the, grounds, of, his, home, hughenden, manor, there, is, also, a, memorial, to, him, in, the, chancel, in, the, church, erected, in, his, honour, by, queen, victoria, his, literary, executor, was, his, private, secretary, lord, rowton, the, disraeli, vault, also, contains, the, body, of, sarah, brydges, willyams, the, wife, of, james, brydges, willyams, of, st, mawgan, disraeli, carried, on, a, long, correspondence, with, mrs, willyams, writing, frankly, about, political, affairs, at, her, death, in, 1865, she, left, him, a, large, legacy, which, helped, clear, his, debts, his, will, was, proved, in, april, 1882, at, 84, 019, 18, s, 7, d, roughly, equivalent, to, 10, 705, 647, in, 2023, disraeli, has, a, memorial, in, westminster, abbey, erected, by, the, nation, on, the, motion, of, gladstone, in, his, memorial, speech, on, disraeli, in, the, house, of, commons, gladstone, had, absented, himself, from, the, funeral, with, his, plea, of, the, press, of, public, business, met, with, public, mockery, his, speech, was, widely, anticipated, if, only, because, his, dislike, for, disraeli, was, well, known, in, the, event, the, speech, was, a, model, of, its, kind, in, which, he, avoided, comment, on, disraeli, s, politics, while, praising, his, personal, qualities, disraeli, s, literary, and, political, career, interacted, over, his, lifetime, and, fascinated, victorian, britain, making, him, one, of, the, most, eminent, figures, in, victorian, public, life, and, occasioned, a, large, output, of, commentary, critic, shane, leslie, noted, three, decades, after, his, death, that, disraeli, s, career, was, a, romance, such, as, no, eastern, vizier, or, western, plutocrat, could, tell, he, began, as, a, pioneer, in, dress, and, an, aesthete, of, words, disraeli, actually, made, his, novels, come, true, disraeli, s, novels, are, his, main, literary, achievement, they, have, from, the, outset, divided, critical, opinion, the, writer, r, w, stewart, observed, that, there, have, always, been, two, criteria, for, judging, disraeli, s, novels, political, and, artistic, the, critic, robert, o, kell, concurring, writes, it, is, after, all, even, if, you, are, a, tory, of, the, staunchest, blue, impossible, to, make, disraeli, into, a, first, rate, novelist, and, it, is, equally, impossible, no, matter, how, much, you, deplore, the, extravagances, and, improprieties, of, his, works, to, make, him, into, an, insignificant, one, disraeli, s, early, silver, fork, novels, vivian, grey, 1826, and, the, young, duke, 1831, featured, romanticised, depictions, of, aristocratic, life, despite, his, ignorance, of, it, with, character, sketches, of, well, known, public, figures, lightly, disguised, in, some, of, his, early, fiction, disraeli, also, portrayed, himself, and, what, he, felt, to, be, his, byronic, dual, nature, the, poet, and, the, man, of, action, his, most, autobiographical, novel, was, contarini, fleming, 1832, an, avowedly, serious, work, that, did, not, sell, well, the, critic, william, kuhn, suggests, that, disraeli, s, fiction, can, be, read, as, the, memoirs, he, never, wrote, revealing, the, inner, life, of, a, politician, for, whom, the, norms, of, victorian, public, life, appeared, to, represent, a, social, straitjacket, particularly, with, regard, to, what, kuhn, sees, as, the, author, s, ambiguous, sexuality, of, the, other, novels, of, the, early, 1830s, alroy, is, described, by, blake, as, profitable, but, unreadable, and, the, rise, of, iskander, 1833, the, infernal, marriage, and, ixion, in, heaven, 1834, made, little, impact, henrietta, temple, 1837, was, disraeli, s, next, major, success, it, draws, on, the, events, of, his, affair, with, henrietta, sykes, to, tell, the, story, of, a, debt, ridden, young, man, torn, between, a, mercenary, loveless, marriage, and, a, passionate, love, at, first, sight, for, the, eponymous, heroine, venetia, 1837, was, a, minor, work, written, to, raise, much, needed, cash, in, the, 1840s, disraeli, wrote, a, trilogy, of, novels, with, political, themes, coningsby, attacks, the, evils, of, the, whig, reform, bill, of, 1832, and, castigates, the, leaderless, conservatives, for, not, responding, sybil, or,

view, infused, the, novel, genre, with, political, sensibility, espousing, the, belief, that, england, s, future, as, a, world, power, depended, not, on, the, complacent, old, guard, but, on, youthful, idealistic, politicians, sybil, or, the, two, nations, was, less, idealistic, than, coningsby, the, two, nations, of, its, sub, title, referred, to, the, huge, economic, and, social, gap,

flagging, spirituality, disraeli, often, wrote, about, religion, for, he, was, a, strong, promoter, of, the, church, of, england, he, was, troubled, by, the, growth, of, elaborate, rituals, in, the, late, 19th, century, such, as, the, use, of, incense, and, vestments, and, heard, warnings, to, the, effect, that, the, ritualists, were, going, to, turn, control, of, the, church, of, england, over, to, the, pope, he, consequently, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, public, worship, regulation, act, 1874, which, allowed, the, archbishops, to, go, to, court, to, stop, the, ritualists, lothair,

st, barbe, in, endymion, is, widely, seen, as, a, parody, of, thackeray, who, had, offended, disraeli, more, than, thirty, years, earlier, by, lampooning, him, in, punch, as, codlingsby, disraeli, left, an, unfinished, novel, in, which, the, priggish, central, character, falconet, is, unmistakably, a, caricature, of, gladstone, blake, commented, that, disraeli, produced, an, epic, poem, unbelievably, bad, and, a, five, act, blank, verse, tragedy, if, possible, worse, further, he, wrote, a, discourse, on, political, theory, and, a, political, biography, the, life, of, lord, george, bentinck, which, is, excellent, remarkably, fair, and, accurate, in, the, years, after, disraeli, s, death, as, salisbury, began, his, reign, of, more, than, twenty, years, over, the, conservatives,

been, re, evaluated, by, historians, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, in, 1972, b, h, abbott, stressed, that, it, was, not, disraeli, but, lord, randolph, churchill, who, invented, the, term, tory, democracy, though, it, was, disraeli, who, made, it, an, essential, part, of, conservative, policy, and, philosophy, in, 2007, parry, wrote, the, tory, democrat, myth, did, not, survive, detailed, scrutiny, by, professional, historical, writing, of, the, 1960s, demonstrated, that, disraeli, had, very, little, interest, in, a, programme, of, social, legislation, and, was, very, flexible, in, handling, parliamentary, reform, in, 1867, despite, this, parry, sees, disraeli, rather, than, peel, as, the, founder, of, the, modern, conservative, party, the, conservative, politician, and, writer, douglas, hurd, wrote, in, 2013, was, not, a, one, nation, conservative, and, this, was, not, simply, because, he, never, used, the, phrase, he, rejected, the, concept, in, its, entirety, disraeli, s, enthusiastic, propagation, of, the, british, empire, has, also, been, seen, as, appealing, to, working, class, voters, before, his, leadership, of, the, conservative,

action, to, assert, its, primacy, this, came, about, in, part, because, disraeli, s, own, views, stemmed, that, way, in, part, because, he, saw, advantage, for, the, conservatives, and, partially, in, reaction, against, gladstone, who, disliked, the, expense, of, empire, blake, argued, that, disraeli, s, imperialism, decisively, orientated, the, conservative, party, for, many, years, to, come, and, the, tradition, which, he, started, was, probably, a, bigger, electoral, asset, in, winning, working, class, support, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, century, than, anything, else, some, historians, have, commented, on, a, romantic, impulse, behind, disraeli, s, approach, to, empire, and, foreign, affairs, abbott, writes, to, the, mystical, tory, concepts, of, throne, church, aristocracy, and, people, disraeli, added, empire, others, have, identified, a, strongly, pragmatic, aspect, to, his, policies, gladstone, s, biographer, philip, magnus, contrasted, disraeli, s, grasp, of, foreign, affairs, with, that, of, gladstone, who, never, understood, that, high, moral, principles, in, their, application, to, foreign, policy, are, more, often, destructive, of, political, stability, than, motives, of, national, self, interest, in, parry, s, view, disraeli, s, foreign, policy, can, be, seen, as, a, gigantic, castle, in, the, air, as, it, was, by, gladstone, or, as, an, overdue, attempt, to, force, the, british, commercial, classes, to, awaken, to, the, realities, of, european, politics, during, his, lifetime, disraeli, s, opponents, and, sometimes, even, his, friends, and, allies, questioned, whether, he, sincerely, held, the, views, he, propounded, or, whether, they, were, adopted, by, him, as, politically, essential, and, lacked, conviction, lord, john, manners, in, 1843, at, the, time, of, young, england, wrote, could, i, only, satisfy, myself, that, d, israeli, believed, all, that, he, said, i, should, be, more, happy, his, historical, views, are, quite, mine, but, does, he, believe, them, paul, smith, in, his, journal, article, on, disraeli, s, politics, argues, that, disraeli, s, ideas, were, coherently, argued, over, a, political, career, of, nearly, half, a, century, and, it, is, impossible, to, sweep, them, aside, as, a, mere, bag, of, burglar, s, tools, for, effecting, felonious, entry, to, the, british, political, pantheon, stanley, weintraub, in, his, biography, of, disraeli, points, out, that, his, subject, did, much, to, advance, britain, towards, the, 20th, century, carrying, one, of, the, two, great, reform, acts, of, the, 19th, despite, the, opposition, of, his, liberal, rival, gladstone, he, helped, preserve, constitutional, monarchy, by, drawing, the, queen, out, of, mourning, into, a, new, symbolic, national, role, and, created, the, climate, for, what, became, tory, democracy, he, articulated, an, imperial, role, for, britain, that, would, last, into, world, war, ii, and, brought, an,

a, charlatan, and, by, others, as, a, far, sighted, and, patriotic, statesman, as, an, actor, on, the, political, stage, he, played, many, roles, byronic, hero, man, of, letters, social, critic,

stiff, challenge, historian, llewellyn, woodward, has, evaluated, disraeli, disraeli, s, political, ideas, have, not, stood, the, test, of, time, his, detachment, from, english, prejudices, did, not, give, him, any, particular, insight, into, foreign, affairs, as, a, young, man, he, accepted, the, platitudes, of, metternich, and, failed, to, understand, the, meaning, of, the, nationalist, movements, in, europe, the, imperialism, of, his, later, years, was, equally, superficial, an, interpretation, of, politics, without, economics, disraeli, liked, to, think, of, himself, in, terms, of, pure, intellect, but, his, politics, were, more, personal, than, intellectual, in, character, he, had, far, reaching, schemes, but, little, administrative, ability, and, there, was, some, foundation, for, napoleon, ill, s, judgement, that, he, was, like, all, literary, men, from, chateaubriand, to, guizot, ignorant, of, the, world, in, spite, of, these, faults, disraeli, s, courage, quickness, of, wit, capacity, for, affection, and, freedom, from, sordid, motives, earned, him, his, position, his, ambition, was, of, the, nobler, sort, he, brought, politics, nearer, to, poetry, or, at, all, events, to, poetical, prose, than, any, english, politician, since, burke, historical, writers, have, often, played, disraeli, and, gladstone, against, each, other, as, great, rivals, roland, quinault, however, cautions, not, to, exaggerate, the, confrontation, they, were, not, direct, antagonists, for, most, of, their, political, careers, indeed, initially, they, were, both, loyal, to, the, tory, party, the, church, and, the, landed, interest, although, their, paths, diverged, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, and, later, over, fiscal, policy, more, generally, it, was, not, until, the, later, 1860s, that, their, differences, over, parliamentary, reform, irish, and, church, policy, assumed, great, partisan, significance, even, then, their, personal, relations, remained, fairly, cordial, until, their, dispute, over, the, eastern, question, in, the, later, 1870s, by, 1882, 46, 000, jews, lived, in, england, and, by, 1890, jewish, emancipation, was, complete,

to, the, landed, aristocracy, used, his, jewish, ancestry, to, claim, an, aristocratic, heritage, of, his, own, his, biographer, jonathan, parry, argues, disraeli, convinced, himself, wrongly, that, he, derived, from, the, sephardi, aristocracy, of, iberian, jews, driven, from, spain, at, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, presenting, himself, as, jewish, symbolized, disraeli, s, uniqueness, when, he, was, fighting, for, respect, and, explained, his, set, backs, presenting, jewishness, as, aristocratic, and, religious, legitimized, his, claim, to, understand, the, perils, facing, modern, england, and, to, offer, national, solutions, to, them, english, toryism, was, copied, from, the, mighty, prototype, coningsby, bk, 4, chap, 15, disraeli, was, thus, able, to, square, his, jewishness, with, his, equally, deep, attachment, to, england, and, her, history, todd, endelman, points, out, that, the, link, between, jews, and, old, clothes, was, so, fixed, in, the, popular, imagination, that, victorian, political, cartoonists, regularly, drew, benjamin, disraeli, as, an, old, clothes, man, in, order, to, stress, his, jewishness, he, adds, before, the, 1990s, few, biographers, of, disraeli, or, historians, of, victorian, politics, acknowledged, the, prominence, of, the, antisemitism, that, accompanied, his, climb, up, the, greasy, pole, or, its, role, in, shaping, his, own, singular, sense, of, jewishness, according, to, michael, ragussis, what, began, in, the, 1830s, as, scattered, anti, semitic, remarks, aimed, at, him, by, the, crowds, in, his, early, electioneering, became, in, the, 1870s, a, kind, of, national, scrutiny, of, his, jewishness, a, scrutiny, that, erupted, into, a, kind, of, anti, semitic, attack, led, by, some, of, the, most, prominent, intellectuals, and, politicians, of, the, time, and, anchored, in, the, charge, that, disraeli, was, a, crypto, jew, historian, michael, diamond, asserts, that, for, british, music, hall, patrons, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, xenophobia, and, pride, in, empire, were, reflected, in, the, halls, most, popular, political, heroes, all, were, conservatives, and, disraeli, stood, out, above, all, even, decades, after, his, death, while, gladstone, was, used, as, a, villain, film, historian, roy, armes, has, argued, that, historical, films, helped, maintain, the, political, status, quo, in, britain, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, by, imposing, an, establishment, viewpoint, that, emphasized, the, greatness, of, monarchy, empire, and, tradition, the, films, created, a, facsimile, world, where, existing, values, were, invariably, validated, by, events, in, the, film, and, where, all, discord, could, be, turned, into, harmony, by, an, acceptance, of, the, status, quo, steven, fielding, has, argued, that, disraeli, was, an, especially, popular, film, hero, historical, dramas, favoured, disraeli, over, gladstone, and, more, substantively, promulgated, an, essentially, deferential, view,
