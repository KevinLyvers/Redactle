soldiers, drowning, near, shore, and, wading, out, into, near, waist, deep, water, came, to, their, rescue, this, icy, water, rescue, is, said, to, have, exacerbated, peter, s, bladder, problems, and, caused, his, death, the, story, however, has, been, viewed, with, skepticism, by, some, historians, pointing, out, that, the, german, chronicler, de, jacob, von, staehlin, is, the, only, source, for, the, story, in, early, january, 1725, peter, was, struck, once, again, with, uremia, or, azotemia, legend, has, it, that, before, lapsing, into, unconsciousness, peter, asked, for, a, paper, and, pen,

the, all, joking, all, drunken, synod, of, fools, and, jesters, an, organization, that, mocked, the, orthodox, and, catholic, church, when, he, was, eighteen, in, january, 1695, peter, refused, to, partake, in, a, traditional, russian, orthodox, ceremony, of, the, epiphany, ceremony, and, would, often, schedule, events, for, the, all, joking, all, drunken, synod, of, fools, and, jesters, to, directly, conflict, with, the, church, he, often, used, the, nickname, pakhom, mikhailov, russian, among, the, ministers, of, religion, who, made, up, his, relatively, close, circle, of, long, term, drinking, companions, peter, was, brought, up, in, the, russian, orthodox, faith, but, he, had, low, regard, for, the, church, hierarchy, which, he, kept, under, tight, governmental, control, the, traditional, leader, of, the, church, was, the, patriarch, of, moscow, in, 1700, when, the, office, fell, vacant, peter, refused, to, name, a, replacement, allowing, the, patriarch, s, coadjutor, or, deputy, to, discharge, the, duties, of, the, office, peter, could, not, tolerate, the, patriarch, exercising, power, superior, to, the, tsar, as, indeed, had, happened, in, the, case, of, philaret,

peter, the, great, therefore, abolished, the, patriarchate, replacing, it, with, a, holy, synod, that, was, under, the, control, of, a, procurator, in, 1721, peter, followed, the, advice, of, prokopovich, in, designing, the, holy, synod, as, a, council, of, ten, clergymen, for, leadership, in, the, church, peter, turned, increasingly, to, ukrainians, who, were, more, open, to, reform, but, were, not, well, loved, by, the, russian, clergy, peter, implemented, a, law, that, stipulated, that, no, russian, man, could, join, a, monastery, before, the, age, of, fifty, he, felt, that, too,

children, three, of, whom, survived, to, adulthood, peter, s, mother, selected, his, first, wife, eudoxia, lopukhina, when, he, was, only, 16, this, was, consistent, with, previous, romanov, tradition, by, choosing, a, daughter, of, a, minor, noble, this, was, done, to, prevent, fighting, between, the, stronger, noble, houses, and, to, bring, fresh, blood, into, the, family, upon, his, return, from, his, european, tour, in, 1698, peter, sought, to, end, his, unhappy, marriage, he, divorced, the, tsaritsa, and, forced, her, to, join, a, convent, she, had, borne, him, three, children,
