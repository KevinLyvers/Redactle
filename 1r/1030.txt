overlord, the, young, king, then, turned, his, attention, to, anatolia, where, roman, power, was, on, the, rise, he, contrived, to, partition, paphlagonia, and, galatia, with, king, nicomedes, iii, of, bithynia, it, was, probably, on, the, occasion, of, the, paphlagonian, invasion, of, 108, bc, that, mithridates, adopted, the, bithynian, era, for, use, on, his, coins, in, honour, of, the, alliance, this, calendar, era, began, with, the, first, bithynian, king, zipoites, i, in, 297, bc, it, was, certainly, in, use, in, pontus, by, 96, bc, at, the, latest, yet, it, soon, became, clear, to, mithridates, that, nicomedes, was, steering, his, country, into, an, anti, pontic, alliance, with, the, expanding, roman, republic, when, mithridates, fell, out, with, nicomedes, over, control, of, cappadocia, and, defeated, him, in, a, series, of, battles, the, latter, was, constrained, to, openly, enlist, the, assistance, of, rome, the, romans, twice, interfered, in, the, conflict, on,

in, the, social, war, a, civil, war, with, its, italian, allies, as, a, result, there, were, only, two, legions, present, in, all, of, roman, asia, both, in, macedonia, these, legions, combined, with, nicomedes, iv, s, army, to, invade, mithridates, kingdom, of, pontus, in, 89, bc, mithridates, won, a, decisive, victory, scattering, the, roman, led, forces, his, victorious, forces, were, welcomed, throughout, anatolia, the, following, year, 88, bc, mithridates, orchestrated, a, massacre, of, roman, and, italian, settlers, remaining, in, several, major, anatolian, cities, including, pergamon, and, tralles, essentially, wiping, out, the, roman, presence, in, the, region, as, many, as, 80, 000, people, are, said, to, have, perished, in, the, massacre, the, episode, is, known, as, the, asiatic, vespers, the, kingdom, of, pontus, comprised, a, mixed, population, in, its, ionian, greek, and, anatolian, cities, the, royal, family, moved, the, capital, from, amasia, to, the, greek, city, of, sinope, its, rulers, tried, to, fully, assimilate, the, potential, of, their, subjects, by, showing, a, greek, face, to, the, greek, world, and, an, iranian, anatolian, face, to, the, eastern, world, whenever, the, gap, between, the, rulers, and, their, anatolian, subjects, became, greater, they, would, put, emphasis, on, their, persian, origins, in, this, manner, the, royal, propaganda, claimed, heritage, both, from, persian, and, greek, rulers, including, cyrus, the, great, darius, i, of, persia, alexander, the, great, and, seleucus, i, nicator, mithridates, too, posed, as, a, champion, of, hellenism, but, this, was, mainly, to, further, his, political, ambitions, it, is, no, proof, that, he, felt, a, mission, to, promote, its, extension, within, his, domains, whatever, his, true, intentions, the, greek, cities, including, athens, defected, to, the, side, of, mithridates, and, welcomed, his, armies, in, mainland, greece, while, his, fleet, besieged, the, romans, at, rhodes, his, neighbor, to, the, southeast, the, king, of, armenia, tigranes, the, great, established, an, alliance, with, mithridates, and, married, one, of, mithridates, daughters, cleopatra, of, pontus, the, two, rulers, would, continue, to, support, each, other, in, the, coming, conflict, with, rome, the, romans, responded, to, the, massacre, of, 88, bc, by, organising, a, large, invasion, force, to, defeat, mithridates, and, remove, him, from, power, the, first, mithridatic, war, fought, between, 88, and, 84, bc, saw, lucius, cornelius, sulla, force, mithridates, out, of, greece, proper, after, achieving, victory, in, several, battles, sulla, received, news, of, trouble, back, in, rome, posed, by, his, rival, gaius, marius, and, hurriedly, concluded, peace, talks, with, mithridates, as, sulla, returned, to, italy, lucius, licinius, murena, was, left, in, charge, of, roman, forces, in, anatolia, the, lenient, peace, treaty, which, was, never, ratified, by, the, senate, allowed, mithridates, vi, to, restore, his, forces, murena, attacked, mithridates, in, 83, bc, provoking, the, second, mithridatic, war, from, 83, to, 81, bc, mithridates, defeated, murena, s, two, green, legions, at, the, battle, of, halys, in, 82, bc, before, peace, was, again, declared, by, treaty, when, rome, attempted, to, annex, bithynia, bequeathed, to, rome, by, its, last, king, nearly, a, decade, later, mithridates, attacked, with, an, even, larger, army, leading, to, the, third, mithridatic, war, from, 73, bc, to, 63, bc, lucullus, was, sent, against, mithridates, and, the, romans, routed, the, pontic, forces, at, the, battle, of, cabira, in, 72, bc, driving, mithridates, into, exile, in, tigranes, armenia, while, lucullus, was, preoccupied, fighting, the, armenians, mithridates, surged, back, to, retake, pontus, by, crushing, four, roman, legions, under, valerius, triarius, and, killing, 7, 000, roman, soldiers, at, the, battle, of, zela, in, 67, bc, he, was, routed, by, pompey, s, legions, at, the, battle, of, the, lycus, in, 66, bc, after, this, defeat, mithridates, fled, with, a, small, army, to, colchis, and, then, over, the, caucasus, mountains, to, crimea, and, made, plans, to, raise, yet, another, army, to, take, on, the, romans, his, eldest, living, son, machares, viceroy, of, cimmerian, bosporus, was, unwilling, to, aid, his, father, mithridates, had, machares, killed, and, mithridates, took, the, throne, of, the, bosporan, kingdom, he, then, ordered, conscription, and, preparations, for, war, in, 63, bc, another, of, his, sons, pharnaces, ii, of, pontus, led, a, rebellion, against, his, father, joined, by, roman, exiles, in, the, core, of, mithridates, pontic, army, mithridates, withdrew, to, the, citadel, in, panticapaeum, where, he, committed, suicide, pompey, buried, mithridates, in, the, rock, cut, tombs, of, his, ancestors, in, amasia, the, old, capital, of, pontus, after, pompey, defeated, him, in, pontus, mithridates, vi, fled, to, the, lands, north, of, the, black, sea, in, the, winter, of, 66, bc, in, the, hope, that, he, could, raise, a, new, army, and, carry, on, the, war, through, invading, italy, by, way, of, the, danube, his, preparations, proved, to, be, too, harsh, on, the, local, nobles, and, populace, and, they, rebelled, against, his, rule, he, reportedly, attempted, suicide, by, poison, which, failed, because, of, his, immunity, to, the, substance, according, to, appian, s, roman, history, he, then, requested, his, gallic, bodyguard, and, friend, bituitus, to, kill, him, by, the, sword, mithridates, then, took, out, some, poison, that, he, always, carried, next, to, his, sword, and, mixed, it, there, two, of, his, daughters, who, were, still, girls, growing, up, together, named, mithridates, and, nysa, who, had, been, betrothed, to, the, kings, of, egypt, and, of, cyprus, asked, him, to, let, them, have, some, of, the, poison, first, and, insisted, strenuously, and, prevented, him, from, drinking, it, until, they, had, taken, some, and, swallowed, it, the, drug, took, effect, on, them, at, once, but, upon, mithridates, although, he, walked, around, rapidly, to, hasten, its, action, it, had, no, effect, because, he, had, accustomed, himself, to, other, drugs, by, continually, trying, them, as, a, means, of, protection, against, poisoners, these, are, still, called, the, mithridatic, drugs, seeing, a, certain, bituitus, there, an, officer, of, the, gauls, he, said, to, him, i, have, profited, much, from, your, right, arm, against, my, enemies, i, shall, profit, from, it, most, of, all, if, you, will, kill, me, and, save, from, the, danger, of, being, led, in, a, roman, triumph, one, who, has, been, an, autocrat, so, many, years, and, the, ruler, of, so, great, a, kingdom, but, who, is, now, unable, to, die, by, poison, because, like, a, fool, he, has, fortified, himself, against, the, poison, of, others, although, i, have, kept, watch, and, ward, against, all, the, poisons, that, one, takes, with, his, food, i, have, not, provided, against, that, domestic, poison, always, the, most, dangerous, to, kings, the, treachery, of, army, children, and, friends, bituitus, thus, appealed, to, rendered, the, king, the, service, that, he, desired, cassius, dio, s, roman, history, records, a, different, account, mithridates, had, tried, to, make, away, with, himself, and, after, first, removing, his, wives, and, remaining, children, by, poison, he, had, swallowed, all, that, was, left, yet, neither, by, that, means, nor, by, the, sword, was, he, able, to, perish, by, his, own, hands, for, the, poison, although, deadly, did, not, prevail, over, him, since, he, had, inured, his, constitution, to, it, taking, precautionary, antidotes, in, large, doses, every, day, and, the, force, of, the, sword, blow, was, lessened, on, account, of, the, weakness, of, his, hand, caused, by, his, age, and, present, misfortunes, and, as, a, result, of, taking, the, poison, whatever, it, was, when, therefore, he, failed, to, take, his, life, through, his, own, efforts, and, seemed, to, linger, beyond, the, proper, time, those, whom, he, had, sent, against, his, son, fell, upon, him, and, hastened, his, end, with, their, swords, and, spears, thus, mithridates, who, had, experienced, the, most, varied, and, remarkable, fortune, had, not, even, an, ordinary, end, to, his, life, for, he, desired, to, die, albeit, unwillingly, and, though, eager, to, kill, himself, was, unable, to, do, so, but, partly, by, poison, and, partly, by, the, sword, he, was, at, once, self, slain, and, murdered, by, his, foes, at, the, behest, of, pompey, mithridates, body, was, later, buried, alongside, his, ancestors, in, either, sinope, or, amaseia, mount, mithridat, in, the, central, kerch, and, the, town, of, yevpatoria, in, crimea, commemorate, his, name, where, his, ancestors, pursued, philhellenism, as, a, means, of, attaining, respectability, and, prestige, among, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, mithridates, vi, made, use, of, hellenism, as, a, political, tool, greeks, romans, and, asians, were, welcome, at, his, court, as, protector, of, greek, cities, on, the, black, sea, and, in, asia, against, barbarism, mithridates, vi, logically, became, protector, of, greece, and, greek, culture, and, used, this, stance, in, his, clashes, with, rome, strabo, mentions, that, chersonesus, buckled, under, the, pressure, of, the, barbarians, and, asked, mithridates, vi, to, become, its, protector, 7, 4, 3, c, 308, the, most, impressive, symbol, of, mithridates, vi, s, approbation, with, greece, athens, in, particular, appears, at, delos, a, heroon, dedicated, to, the, pontic, king, in, 102, 1, bc, by, the, athenian, helianax, a, priest, of, poseidon, aisios, a, dedication, at, delos, by, dicaeus, a, priest, of, sarapis, was, made, in, 94, 93, bc, on, behalf, of, the, athenians, romans, and, king, mithridates, eupator, dionysus, greek, styles, mixed, with, persian, elements, also, abound, on, official, pontic, coins, perseus, was, favored, as, an, intermediary, between, both, worlds, east, and, west, certainly, influenced, by, alexander, the, great, mithridates, vi, extended, his, propaganda, from, defender, of, greece, to, the, great, liberator, of, the, greek, world, as, war, with, the, roman, republic, became, inevitable, the, romans, were, easily, translated, into, barbarians, in, the, same, sense, as, the, persian, empire, during, the, war, with, persia, in, the, first, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, and, during, alexander, s, campaign, how, many, greeks, genuinely, agreed, with, this, claim, will, never, be, known, it, served, its, purpose, at, least, partially, because, of, it, mithridates, vi, was, able, to, fight, the, first, war, with, rome, on, greek, soil, and, maintain, the, allegiance, of, greece, his, campaign, for, the, allegiance, of, the, greeks, was, aided, in, no, small, part, by, his, enemy, sulla, who, allowed, his, troops, to, sack, the, city, of, delphi, and, plunder, many, of, the, city, s, most, famous, treasures, to, help, finance, his, military, expenses, in, his, youth, after, the, assassination, of, his, father, mithridates, v, in, 120, bc, mithridates, is, said, to, have, lived, in, the, wilderness, for, seven, years, inuring, himself, to, hardship, while, there, and, after, his, accession, he, cultivated, an, immunity, to, poisons, by, regularly, ingesting, sub, lethal, doses, of, poisons, particularly, the, arsenic, that, killed, his, father, mithridates, v, this, form, of, hormesis, is, effective, against, some, but, not, all, toxins, and, subsequently, became, known, as, mithridatism, or, mithridatization, after, he, became, king, of, pontus, mithridates, continued, to, study, poisons, and, develop, antidotes, whose, initial, efficacies, were, tested, on, pontic, criminals, condemned, to, death, attalus, iii, of, pergamon, d, 133, bc, is, also, known, to, have, studied, poisons, and, antidotes, in, this, way, in, keeping, with, most, medical, practices, of, his, era, mithridates, antitoxin, routines, included, a, religious, component, they, were, supervised, by, the, agari, a, group, of, scythian, shamans, who, never, left, him, he, was, also, reportedly, guarded, in, his, sleep, by, a, horse, a, bull, and, a, stag, which, would, whinny, bellow, and, bleat, whenever, anyone, approached, the, royal, bed, the, greek, doctor, crateuas, the, rootcutter, may, have, worked, directly, under, mithridates, or, may, have, only, been, in, correspondence, with, him, mithridates, was, also, said, to, have, received, samples, including, megalium, and, kyphi, from, zopyrus, of, alexandria, and, treatises, from, asclepiades, in, lieu, of, a, requested, visit, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 63, bc, mithridates, was, reported, to, have, developed, a, complex, universal, antidote, against, poisoning, which, he, took, every, day, with, cold, spring, water, and, which, became, known, as, mithridate, or, mithridatium, he, was, said, to, consume, it, daily, the, original, formula, has, been, entirely, lost, although, pliny, reports, that, mithridates, various, antidotes, usually, included, the, blood, of, pontic, ducks, possibly, ruddy, shelducks, which, fed, on, poisonous, plants, like, hellebore, and, hemlock, and, thus, provided, a, kind, of, serum, against, them, elsewhere, pliny, reports, that, surviving, notes, of, mithridates, work, did, not, include, exotic, ingredients, and, that, pompey, found, an, antidote, recipe, among, mithridates, notes, that, consisted, of, 2, dried, walnuts, 2, figs, and, 20, rue, leaves, which, were, supposed, to, be, crushed, together, and, taken, with, a, pinch, of, salt, by, a, person, who, had, fasted, for, at, least, one, day, the, legions, under, pompey, who, had, defeated, mithridates, killed, his, secretary, callistratus, and, burnt, some, of, his, papers, but, were, also, reported, to, have, taken, an, extensive, medicinal, library, and, collection, of, specimens, back, to, rome, where, pompey, s, slave, lenaeus, translated, them, into, latin, and, the, roman, doctors, like, a, cornelius, celsus, began, prescribing, various, recipes, under, the, name, of, mithridates, antidote, latin, antidotum, mithridaticum, numerous, recipes, survive, from, the, 1st, century, all, consisting, of, a, polypharmiceutical, electuary, including, castor, from, willow, consuming, beavers, and, opium, sweetened, with, honey, pontic, honey, tending, to, contain, mild, amounts, of, poison, from, local, plants, like, rhododendron, and, oleander, but, otherwise, all, differing, in, both, ingredients, and, amounts, it, seems, likely, pompey, and, lenaeus, kept, mithridates, personal, recipe, secret, leading, to, various, attempts, to, recreate, it, after, their, deaths, a, foreign, father, and, son, both, named, paccius, seem, to, have, become, rich, selling, their, own, secret, recipe, under, tiberius, around, the, same, time, celsus, advocated, taking, an, almond, sized, amount, of, his, ginger, heavy, preparation, daily, with, wine, andromachus, the, elder, nero, s, court, physician, developed, theriac, theriaca, andromachi, by, supplementing, the, versions, of, mithridates, formula, known, in, his, day, with, more, opium, poppy, seeds, and, a, homeopathic, addition, of, viper, flesh, one, of, the, vats, uncovered, at, pompeii, seems, to, have, been, used, to, create, this, version, of, mithridates, antidote, galen, added, still, more, opium, and, a, skink, in, his, version, of, the, recipe, of, the, plants, shared, across, these, early, forms, of, mithridate, many, seem, to, be, strongly, odoriferous, or, to, exhibit, antibacterial, and, anti, inflammatory, abilities, it, is, also, noteworthy, that, bioactive, alkaloids, and, poisons, are, not, widely, represented, mithridate, and, theriac, continued, to, be, staples, of, western, and, islamic, medicine, into, the, 19th, century, consumed, by, caesar, and, emperors, kings, and, queens, including, marcus, aurelius, septimus, severus, alfred, the, great, charlemagne, henry, viii, and, queen, elizabeth, some, medieval, preparations, had, as, many, as, 184, ingredients, owing, to, the, idea, that, disease, could, be, caused, by, internal, poisons, the, antidotes, also, came, to, be, thought, of, as, panaceas, able, to, cure, damage, from, falls, some, illnesses, or, even, all, illnesses, when, it, failed, the, problem, was, believed, to, be, improper, preparation, or, storage, leading, some, jurisdictions, to, legally, require, its, preparation, in, full, view, of, the, public, in, city, squares, concerns, about, mithridate, s, purity, and, later, inefficacy, were, closely, involved, with, the, development, of, medical, and, pharmaceutical, regulation, mithridate, remains, available, from, some, doctors, particularly, in, the, middle, east, as, early, as, pliny, however, some, considered, it, quackery, and, its, various, components, and, proportions, pseudoscientific, chinese, doctors, received, samples, of, mithridate, from, muslim, ambassadors, in, the, tang, dynasty, but, never, popularized, or, advocated, it, the, islamic, scientist, averroes, meanwhile, believed, it, may, be, helpful, in, some, cases, but, cautioned, against, regular, consumption, by, the, healthy, as, it, could, actually, transform, human, nature, into, a, kind, of, poison, it, notably, failed, as, a, cure, to, plague, and, epilepsy, and, william, heberden, s, 1745, antitheriaca, greek, antith, riaka, helped, fully, discredit, it, in, england, by, the, 19th, century, it, was, only, being, prescribed, for, dyspepsia, or, described, as, of, historical, interest, only, in, pliny, the, elder, s, account, of, famous, polyglots, mithridates, could, speak, the, languages, of, all, the, twenty, two, nations, he, governed, this,
