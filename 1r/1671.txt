baron, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, swedish, 20, august, 1779, 7, august, 1848, was, a, swedish, chemist, in, general, he, is, considered, the, last, person, to, know, the, whole, field, of, chemistry, berzelius, is, considered, along, with, robert, boyle, john, dalton, and, antoine, lavoisier, to, be, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, chemistry, berzelius, became, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1808, and, served, from, 1818, as, its, principal, functionary, he, is, known, in, sweden, as, the, father, of, swedish, chemistry, during, his, lifetime, he, did, not, customarily, use, his, first, given, name, and, was, universally, known, simply, as, jacob, berzelius, although, berzelius, began, his, career, as, a, physician, his, enduring, contributions, were, in, the, fields, of, electrochemistry, chemical, bonding, and, stoichiometry, in, particular, he, is, noted, for, his, determination, of, atomic, weights, and, his, experiments, that, led, to, a, more, complete, understanding, of, the, principles, of, stoichiometry, which, is, the, branch, of, chemistry, pertaining, to, the, quantitative, relationships, between, elements, in, chemical, compounds, and, chemical, reactions, and, that, these, occur, in, definite, proportions, this, understanding, came, to, be, known, as, the, law, of, constant, proportions, berzelius, was, a, strict, empiricist, expecting, that, any, new, theory, must, be, consistent, with, the, sum, of, contemporary, chemical, knowledge, he, developed, improved, methods, of, chemical, analysis, which, were, required, to, develop, the, basic, data, in, support, of, his, work, on, stoichiometry, he, investigated, isomerism, allotropy, and, catalysis, phenomena, that, owe, their, names, to, him, berzelius, was, among, the, first, to, articulate, the, differences, between, inorganic, compounds, and, organic, compounds, among, the, many, minerals, and, elements, he, studied, he, is, credited, with, discovering, cerium, and, selenium, and, with, being, the, first, to, isolate, silicon, and, thorium, following, on, his, interest, in, mineralogy, berzelius, synthesized, and, chemically, characterized, new, compounds, of, these, and, other, elements, berzelius, demonstrated, the, use, of, an, electrochemical, cell, to, decompose, certain, chemical, compounds, into, pairs, of, electrically, opposite, constituents, from, this, research, he, articulated, a, theory, that, came, to, be, known, as, electrochemical, dualism, contending, that, chemical, compounds, are, oxide, salts, bonded, together, by, electrostatic, interactions, this, theory, while, useful, in, some, contexts, came, to, be, seen, as, insufficient, berzelius, s, work, with, atomic, weights, and, his, theory, of, electrochemical, dualism, led, to, his, development, of, a, modern, system, of, chemical, formula, notation, that, showed, the, composition, of, any, compound, both, qualitatively, and, quantitatively, his, system, abbreviated, the, latin, names, of, the, elements, with, one, or, two, letters, and, applied, superscripts, to, designate, the, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, present, in, the, compound, later, chemists, changed, to, use, of, subscripts, rather, than, superscripts, berzelius, was, born, in, the, parish, of, v, versunda, in, sterg, tland, in, sweden, his, father, samuel, berzelius, was, a, school, teacher, in, the, nearby, city, of, link, ping, and, his, mother, elizabeth, dorothea, sj, steen, was, a, homemaker, his, parents, were, both, from, families, of, church, pastors, berzelius, lost, both, his, parents, at, an, early, age, his, father, died, in, 1779, after, which, his, mother, married, a, pastor, named, anders, eckmarck, who, gave, berzelius, a, basic, education, including, knowledge, of, the, natural, world, following, the, death, of, his, mother, in, 1787, relatives, in, link, ping, took, care, of, him, there, he, attended, the, school, today, known, as, katedralskolan, as, a, teenager, he, took, a, position, as, a, tutor, at, a, farm, near, his, home, during, which, time, he, became, interested, in, collecting, flowers, and, insects, and, their, classification, berzelius, later, enrolled, as, a, medical, student, at, uppsala, university, from, 1796, to, 1801, anders, gustaf, ekeberg, the, discoverer, of, tantalum, taught, him, chemistry, during, this, time, he, worked, as, an, apprentice, in, a, pharmacy, during, which, time, he, also, learned, practical, matters, in, the, laboratory, such, as, glassblowing, on, his, own, during, his, studies, he, successfully, repeated, the, experimentation, conducted, by, swedish, chemist, carl, william, scheele, which, led, to, scheele, s, discovery, of, oxygen, he, also, worked, with, a, physician, in, the, medevi, mineral, springs, during, this, time, he, conducted, an, analysis, of, the, water, from, this, source, additionally, as, part, of, his, studies, in, 1800, berzelius, learned, about, alessandro, volta, s, electric, pile, the, first, device, that, could, provide, a, constant, electric, current, i, e, the, first, battery, he, constructed, a, similar, battery, for, himself, consisting, of, alternating, disks, of, copper, and, zinc, and, this, was, his, initial, work, in, the, field, of, electrochemistry, as, thesis, research, in, his, medical, studies, he, examined, the, influence, of, galvanic, current, on, several, diseases, this, line, of, experimentation, produced, no, clear, cut, evidence, for, such, influence, berzelius, graduated, as, a, medical, doctor, in, 1802, he, worked, as, a, physician, near, stockholm, until, the, chemist, and, mine, owner, wilhelm, hisinger, recognized, his, abilities, as, an, analytical, chemist, and, provided, him, with, a, laboratory, in, 1807, berzelius, was, appointed, professor, in, chemistry, and, pharmacy, at, the, karolinska, institute, between, 1808, and, 1836, berzelius, worked, together, with, anna, sundstr, m, who, acted, as, his, assistant, and, was, the, first, female, chemist, in, sweden, in, 1808, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, at, this, time, the, academy, had, been, stagnating, for, several, years, since, the, era, of, romanticism, in, sweden, had, led, to, less, interest, in, the, sciences, in, 1818, berzelius, was, elected, the, academy, s, secretary, and, held, the, post, until, 1848, during, berzelius, tenure, he, is, credited, with, revitalising, the, academy, and, bringing, it, into, a, second, golden, era, the, first, being, the, astronomer, pehr, wilhelm, wargentin, s, period, as, secretary, from, 1749, to, 1783, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1822, in, 1827, he, became, correspondent, of, the, royal, institute, of, the, netherlands, and, in, 1830, associate, member, in, 1837, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, swedish, academy, on, chair, number, 5, berzelius, was, active, in, the, temperance, movement, along, with, bengt, franc, sparre, august, von, hartmansdorff, anders, retzius, samuel, owen, george, scott, and, others, he, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, svenska, nykterhetss, llskapet, the, swedish, temperance, society, in, 1837, and, its, first, chairman, berzelius, wrote, the, foreword, to, one, of, carl, af, ekenstam, s, works, on, the, topic, of, which, 50, 000, copies, were, printed, through, much, of, his, life, berzelius, suffered, various, medical, ailments, these, included, recurrent, migraine, headaches, and, then, later, on, he, suffered, from, gout, he, also, had, episodes, of, depression, in, 1818, berzelius, had, a, nervous, breakdown, said, to, be, due, to, the, stress, of, his, work, the, medical, advice, he, received, was, to, travel, and, take, vacation, however, during, this, time, berzelius, traveled, to, france, to, work, in, the, chemical, laboratories, of, claude, louis, berthollet, in, 1835, at, the, age, of, 56, he, married, elizabeth, poppius, the, 24, year, old, daughter, of, a, swedish, cabinet, minister, he, died, on, 7, august, 1848, at, his, home, in, stockholm, where, he, had, lived, since, 1806, he, is, buried, in, the, solna, cemetery, soon, after, arriving, in, stockholm, berzelius, wrote, a, chemistry, textbook, for, his, medical, students, l, rbok, i, kemien, which, was, his, first, significant, scientific, publication, he, had, conducted, experimentation, in, preparation, for, writing, this, textbook, on, the, compositions, of, inorganic, compounds, which, was, his, earliest, work, on, definite, proportions, in, 1813, 4, he, submitted, a, lengthy, essay, published, in, five, separate, articles, on, the, proportions, of, elements, in, compounds, the, essay, commenced, with, a, general, description, introduced, his, new, symbolism, and, examined, all, the, known, elements, the, essay, ended, with, a, table, of, the, specific, weights, relative, atomic, masses, of, the, elements, where, oxygen, was, set, to, 100, and, a, selection, of, compounds, written, in, his, new, formalism, this, work, provided, evidence, in, favour, of, the, atomic, theory, proposed, by, john, dalton, that, inorganic, chemical, compounds, are, composed, of, atoms, of, different, elements, combined, in, whole, number, amounts, in, discovering, that, atomic, weights, are, not, integer, multiples, of, the, atomic, weight, of, hydrogen, berzelius, also, disproved, prout, s, hypothesis, that, elements, are, built, up, from, atoms, of, hydrogen, 682, 683, berzelius, s, last, revised, version, of, his, atomic, weight, tables, was, first, published, in, a, german, translation, of, his, textbook, of, chemistry, in, 1826, in, order, to, aid, his, experiments, he, developed, a, system, of, chemical, notation, in, which, the, elements, composing, any, particular, chemical, compound, were, given, simple, written, labels, such, as, o, for, oxygen, or, fe, for, iron, with, their, proportions, in, the, chemical, compound, denoted, by, numbers, berzelius, thus, invented, the, system, of, chemical, notation, still, used, today, the, main, difference, being, that, instead, of, the, subscript, numbers, used, today, e, g, h, 2, o, or, fe, 2, o, 3, berzelius, used, superscripts, h, 2, o, or, fe, 2, o, 3, berzelius, is, credited, with, discovering, the, chemical, elements, cerium, and, selenium, and, with, being, the, first, to, isolate, silicon, thorium, titanium, and, zirconium, berzelius, discovered, cerium, in, 1803, and, selenium, in, 1817, berzelius, also, discovered, how, to, isolate, silicon, in, 1824, and, thorium, in, 1824, students, working, in, berzelius, s, laboratory, also, discovered, lithium, lanthanum, and, vanadium, berzelius, discovered, amorphous, silicon, by, repeating, an, experiment, performed, by, gay, lussac, and, th, nard, in, which, they, reacted, silicon, tetrafluoride, with, potassium, metal, which, produced, very, impure, silicon, in, a, variation, of, this, experiment, berzelius, heated, potassium, fluorosilicate, with, potassium, it, produced, potassium, silicide, which, he, then, stirred, with, water, to, produce, relatively, pure, silicon, powder, berzelius, recognized, this, powder, as, the, new, element, of, silicon, which, he, called, silicium, a, name, proposed, earlier, by, davy, berzelius, was, the, first, to, isolate, zirconium, in, 1824, but, pure, zirconium, was, not, produced, until, 1925, by, anton, eduard, van, arkel, and, jan, hendrik, de, boer, berzelius, is, credited, with, originating, the, chemical, terms, catalysis, polymer, isomer, protein, and, allotrope, although, his, original, definitions, in, some, cases, differ, significantly, from, modern, usage, as, an, example, he, coined, the, term, polymer, in, 1833, to, describe, organic, compounds, which, shared, identical, empirical, formulas, but, which, differed, in, overall, molecular, weight, the, larger, of, the, compounds, being, described, as, polymers, of, the, smallest, at, this, time, the, concept, of, chemical, structure, had, not, yet, been, developed, so, that, he, considered, only, the, numbers, of, atoms, of, each, element, in, this, way, he, viewed, for, example, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, as, a, polymer, of, formaldehyde, ch, 2, o, even, though, we, now, know, that, glucose, is, not, a, polymer, of, the, monomer, formaldehyde, berzelius, was, the, first, person, to, make, the, distinction, between, organic, compounds, those, containing, carbon, and, inorganic, compounds, in, particular, he, advised, gerardus, johannes, mulder, in, his, elemental, analyses, of, organic, compounds, such, as, coffee, tea, and, various, proteins, the, term, protein, itself, was, coined, by, berzelius, in, 1838, after, mulder, observed, that, all, proteins, seemed, to, have, the, same, empirical, formula, and, came, to, the, erroneous, conclusion, that, they, might, be, composed, of, a, single, type, of, very, large, molecule, the, term, is, derived, from, the, greek, meaning, of, the, first, rank, and, berzelius, proposed, the, name, because, proteins, were, so, fundamental, to, living, organisms, in, 1808, berzelius, discovered, that, lactic, acid, occurs, in, muscle, tissue, not, just, in, milk, the, term, biliverdin, was, coined, by, berzelius, in, 1840, although, he, preferred, bilifulvin, yellow, red, over, bilirubin, red, berzelius, stated, in, 1810, that, living, things, work, by, some, mysterious, vital, force, a, hypothesis, called, vitalism, vitalism, had, first, been, proposed, by, prior, researchers, although, berzelius, contended, that, compounds, could, be, distinguished, by, whether, they, required, any, organisms, in, their, synthesis, organic, compounds, or, whether, they, did, not, inorganic, compounds, however, in, 1828, friedrich, w, hler, accidentally, obtained, urea, an, organic, compound, by, heating, ammonium, cyanate, this, showed, that, an, organic, compound, such, as, urea, could, be, prepared, synthetically, and, not, exclusively, by, living, organisms, berzelius, corresponded, with, w, hler, on, the, urea, synthesis, findings, however, the, notion, of, vitalism, continued, to, persist, until, further, work, on, abiotic, synthesis, of, organic, compounds, provided, substantial, evidence, against, vitalism, berzelius, was, a, prolific, correspondent, with, leading, scientists, of, his, time, such, as, gerardus, johannes, mulder, claude, louis, berthollet, humphry, davy, friedrich, w, hler, eilhard, mitscherlich, and, christian, friedrich, sch, nbein, in, 1812, berzelius, traveled, to, london, england, including, greenwich, to, meet, with, prominent, british, scientists, of, the, time, these, included, humphry, davy, chemist, william, wollaston, physician, scientist, thomas, young, astronomer, william, herschel, chemist, smithson, tennant, and, inventor, james, watt, among, others, berzelius, also, visited, davy, s, laboratory, after, his, visit, to, davy, s, laboratory, berzelius, remarked, a, tidy, laboratory, is, a, sign, of, a, lazy, chemist, humphry, davy, in, 1810, proposed, that, chlorine, is, an, element, berzelius, rejected, this, claim, because, of, his, belief, that, all, acids, were, based, on, oxygen, since, chlorine, forms, a, strong, acid, muriatic, acid, modern, hcl, chlorine, must, contain, oxygen, and, thus, cannot, be, an, element, however, in, 1812, bernard, courtois, proved, that, iodine, is, an, element, then, in, 1816, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, demonstrated, that, prussic, acid, hydrogen, cyanide, contains, only, hydrogen, carbon, and, nitrogen, and, no, oxygen, these, findings, persuaded, berzelius, that, not, all, acids, contain, oxygen, and, that, davy, and, gay, lussac, were, correct, chlorine, and, iodine, are, indeed, elements, in, 1818, berzelius, was, ennobled, by, king, carl, xiv, johan, in, 1835, he, received, the, title, of, friherre, in, 1820, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, royal, society, of, london, gave, berzelius, the, copley, medal, in, 1836, with, the, citation, for, his, systematic, application, of, the, doctrine, of, definite, proportions, to, the, analysis, of, mineral, bodies, as, contained, in, his, nouveau, systeme, de, mineralogie, and, in, other, of, his, works, in, 1840, berzelius, was, named, knight, of, the, order, of, leopold, in, 1842, he, received, the, honor, pour, le, m, rite, for, sciences, and, arts, the, mineral, berzelianite, a, copper, selenide, was, discovered, in, 1850, and, named, after, him, by, james, dwight, dana, in, 1852, stockholm, sweden, built, a, public, park, and, statue, both, to, honor, berzelius, berzeliusskolan, a, school, situated, next, to, his, alma, mater, katedralskolan, is, named, for, him, in, 1890, a, fairly, prominent, street, in, gothenburg, was, named, berzeliigatan, berzelii, street, in, his, honour, in, 1898, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, opened, the, berzelius, museum, in, honor, of, berzelius, the, holdings, of, the, museum, included, many, items, from, his, laboratory, the, museum, was, opened, on, the, occasion, of, fiftieth, anniversary, of, berzelius, s, death, invitees, at, the, ceremony, marking, the, occasion, included, scientific, dignitaries, from, eleven, european, nations, and, the, united, states, many, of, whom, gave, formal, addresses, in, honor, of, berzelius, the, berzelius, museum, was, later, moved, to, the, observatory, that, is, part, of, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1939, his, portrait, appeared, on, a, series, of, postage, stamps, commemorating, the, bicentenary, of, the, founding, of, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, addition, to, sweden, grenada, likewise, honored, him, the, berzelius, secret, society, at, yale, university, is, named, in, his, honor
