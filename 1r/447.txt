through, the, lives, of, an, ordinary, man, and, woman, the, tree, of, man, and, his, following, work, voss, 1957, established, white, s, favourable, critical, reputation, in, britain, and, america,

in, castle, hill, he, gave, few, interviews, and, usually, declined, requests, for, public, appearances, promotion, of, his, work, and, invitations, for, his, membership, of, literary, and, cultural, organisations, he, entertained, a, close, circle, of, friends, at, his, home, but, always, felt, himself, to, be, an, outsider, first, as, a, child, with, what, kind, of, strange, gift, no, one, quite, knew, then, a, despised, colonial, in, an, english, public, school, finally, an, artist, in, horrified, australia, in, 1961, his, novel, riders, in, the, chariot, was, published, and, was, his, first, to, receive, almost, universal, critical, praise, in, australia, meanwhile, white, s, interest, had, returned, to, the, theatre, the, drama, committee, of, the, adelaide, festival, had, recommended, the, ham, funeral, as, the, festival, s, main, theatrical, production, for, 1962, the, festival, governors, however, rejected, the, play, citing, concerns, about, a, piece, of, work, which, quite, fails, to, reconcile, poetry, with, social, realism, and, a, scene, involving, an, aborted, foetus, in, a, dustbin, the, controversy, led, to, a, successful, amateur, production, of, the, play, in, adelaide, followed, by, a, professional, production, in, sydney, white, was, inspired, to, write, three, further, plays, which, were, given, professional, productions, the, season, at,

them, along, with, most, of, his, manuscripts, papers, letters, and, journals, white, was, working, on, the, solid, mandala, a, novel, about, twins, waldo, and, arthur, brown, who, represent, contrary, aspects, of, his, own, character, he, was, becoming, interested, in, tarot, astrology, the, i, ching, and, jungian, psychology, and, these, interests, are, reflected, in, the, novel, following, its, publication, in, 1966, white, declined, the, encyclopaedia, brittanica, award, and, miles, franklin, award, for, the, novel, and, stated, he, no, longer, wanted, his, works, considered, for, awards, white, had, long, had, an, interest, in, art, and, music, describing, himself, as, something, of, a, frustrated, painter, and, a, composer, manqu, the, core, of, his, art, collection, was, works, by, his, friends, sidney, nolan, and, de, maistre, but, he, collected, works, by, emerging, australian, artists, such, as, james, clifford, erica, mcgilchrist, and, lawrence, daws, and, some, established, artists, like, brett, whiteley, in, early, 1967, he, began, work, on, the, vivisector, a, novel, about, a, painter, hurtle, duffield, who, exploits, human, relationships, for, his, art, after, the, novel, was, published, in, 1970, nolan, believed, duffield, was, based, on, him, but, white, denied, this, stating, that, duffield, was, a, composite, of, his, own, character, and, the, working, life, of, the, artists, john, passmore, and, godfrey, miller, white, was, becoming, more, politically, engaged, at, this, time, he, was, opposed, to, australia, s, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, and, in, december, 1969, he, participated, in, his, first, political, demonstration, breaking, the, law, by, publicly, inciting, young, men, not, to, register, for,

awarded, to, pablo, neruda, he, wrote, to, a, friend, that, nobel, prize, i, hope, i, never, hear, it, mentioned, again, i, certainly, don, t, want, it, the, machinery, behind, it, seems, a, bit, dirty, when, we, thought, that, only, applied, to, australian, awards, in, my, case, to, win, the, prize, would, upset, my, life, far, too, much, and, it, would, embarrass, me, to, be, held, up, to, the, world, as, an, australian, writer, when, apart, from, the, accident, of, blood, i, feel, i, am, temperamentally, a, cosmopolitan, londoner, in, 1970, white, had, begun, working, on, a, new, novel, the, eye, of, the, storm, about, the, meaning, of, his, mother, s, death, he, sent, the, completed, work, to, his, british, publishers, in, december, 1972, he, delayed, sending, it, to, his, american, publishers, viking, because, the, vivisector, had, sold, poorly, in, america, and, he, hoped, positive, reviews, of, the, new, work, in, britain, would, increase, interest, in, the, united, states, the, novel, was, published, in, august, 1973, and, white, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, october, the, nobel, citation, praised, him, for, an, epic, and, psychological,

march, 1974, new, editions, of, his, previous, novels, were, published, and, translation, rights, sold, well, white, however, refused, to, have, happy, valley, republished, as, he, considered, it, an, inferior, early, work, and, he, was, afraid, that, some, of, the, people, on, whom, characters, were, based, might, sue, for, defamation, according, to, david, marr, white, s, biographer, from, the, time, of, the, prize, his, work, became, saturated, with, a, late, relaxed, sensuality, white, himself, was, less, relaxed, about, the, effects, of, the, award, telling, a, supporter, the, nobel, prize, is, a, terrifying, and, destructive, experience, white, was, made, australian, of, the, year, for, 1973, in, his, acceptance, speech, he, said, that, australia, day, should, be, a, day, of, self, searching, rather, than, trumpet, blowing, and, that, historian, manning, clark, comedian, barry, humphries, and, communist, trade, union, leader, jack, mundey, were, more, worthy, of, the, award, in, may, 1974, white, gave, a, speech, in, support, of, the, re, election, of, the, whitlam, labor, government, stating, that, it, was, necessary, for, australia, to, create, an, intellectual, climate, from, which, artists, would, no, longer, feel, the, need, to, flee, following, a, trip, to, fraser, island, to, do, research, for, a, new, novel, a, fringe, of, leaves, he, became, a, supporter, of, the, campaign, to, stop, sand, mining, on, the, island, he, wrote, to, the, re, elected, prime, minister, gough, whitlam, on, the, issue, and, the, campaign, eventually, forced, the,

resigned, in, june, 1976, in, protest, against, the, dismissal, of, the, whitlam, government, in, november, 1975, by, the, governor, general, sir, john, kerr, and, the, subsequent, reintroduction, of, knighthoods, as, part, of, the, order, white, later, wrote, that, kerr, s, behaviour, moved, me, farther, to, the, left, and, made, me, a, convinced, republican, over, the, following, years, he, would, break, with, numerous, long, term, friends, because, he, thought, they, supported, the, conservative, establishment, or, had, compromised, their, personal, or, artistic, integrity, in,

signal, driver, white, was, encouraged, to, write, a, new, play, for, sharman, netherwood, about, the, sanity, in, insanity, and, the, insanity, in, sanity, the, play, premiered, in, adelaide, in,

salman, rushdie, wrote, to, white, in, 1985, praising, the, novel, voss, i, cannot, think, when, last, a, book, so, moved, me, by, this, time, however, white, was, tired, of, praise, for, the, novel, as, he, rated, several, of, his, other, works, more, highly, the, completed, opera, voss, opened, at, the, adelaide, festival, in, march, 1986, to, general, critical, acclaim, white, however, boycotted, the, premiere, because, the, festival, had, invited, the, queen, to, attend, he, attended, the, sydney, premiere, later, that, year, and, judged, it, a, stupendous, occasion, in, april, 1987, white, s, new, play, shepherd, on, the, rocks, opened, at, adelaide, in, a, production, directed, by, neil, armfield, white, attended, and, deemed, it, a, success, he, had, also, written, three, short, prose, poems, which, were, published, as, three, uneasy, pieces, in, late, 1987, white, was, determined, that, none, of, his, works, would, be, published, or, performed, in, 1988, which, was,

ego, in, late, 1951, he, experienced, a, religious, conversion, if, i, say, i, had, no, religious, tendencies, between, adolescence, and, the, tree, of, man, it, s, because, i, was, sufficiently, vain, and, egotistical, to, feel, one, can, ignore, certain, realities, i, think, the, turning, point, came, during, a, season, of, unending, rain, at, castle, hill, when, i, fell, flat, on, my, back, one, day, in, the, mud, and, starting, cursing, a, god, i, had, convinced, myself, didn, t, exist, my, personal, scheme, of, things, until, then, at, once, seemed, too, foolish, to, continue, holding, as, the, 1950s, progressed, white, became, disillusioned, with, the, anglican, church, and, his, religious, beliefs, became, more, eclectic, he, once, described, himself, as, a, lapsed, anglican, egotist, agnostic, pantheist, occultist, existentialist, would, be, though, failed, christian, australian, white, stated, in, 1981, that, he, didn, t, call, himself, a, christian, because, he, couldn, t, follow, christ, s, injunction, to, forgive, in, 1969, however, he, had, affirmed, the, importance, of, religion, in, his, work, religion, yes, that, s, behind, all, my, books, what, i, am, interested, in, is, the, relationship, between, the, blundering, human, being, and, god, in, the, 1930s, white, was, not, politically, engaged, but, was, sympathetic, to, the, francoist, cause, in, the, spanish, civil, war, and, supported, britain, s, policy, of, appeasing, hitler, he, later, expressed, regret, over, his, complacency, regarding, european, fascism, on, his, return, to, australia,

threatened, the, urban, environment, he, publicly, supported, the, australian, labor, party, in, the, federal, elections, of, 1972, 1974, and, 1975, despite, a, falling, out, with, the, prime,

campaigns, for, nuclear, disarmament, and, continued, his, support, for, various, environmental, causes, marr, states, that, a, common, thread, running, through, his, political, interventions, was, his, opposition, to, plutocracy, academic, martin, thomas, argues, that, white, was, acutely, aware, of, his, own, privileged, upbringing, and, this, drove, his, later, concern, about, social, injustice, white, s, first, published, novel, happy, valley, 1939, received, favourable, reviews, in, britain, and, australia, although, some, critics, noted, that, it, was, too, derivative, of, joyce, lawrence, and, woolf, the, novel, was, awarded, the, gold, medal, of, the, australian, literature, society, the, living, and, the, dead, 1941, and, the, aunt, s, story, 1948, attracted, little, critical, attention, in, australia, although, the, latter, was, favourably, reviewed, in, the, new, york, times, review, of, books, the, tree, of, man, 1955, was, white, s, first, major, international, success, attracting, positive, reviews, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, james, stern, writing, in, the, new, york, times, book, review, praised, the, novel, as, a,

copies, in, australia, in, the, first, three, months, and, was, awarded, the, gold, medal, of, the, australian, literature, society, voss, 1957, was, reviewed, favourably, in, the, united, kingdom, but, critics, in, the, united, states, and, australia, were, more, ambivalent, a, significant, body, of, australian, critics, continued, to, fault, white, s, prose, style, and, some, objected, to, his, rejection, of, the, realist, prose, tradition, the, novel, was, a, best, seller, in, the, united, kingdom, and, won, the, inaugural, australian, miles, franklin, award, riders, in, the, chariot, 1961, also, achieved, critical, and, commercial, success, in, the, united, kingdom, and, won, admiring, reviews, in, australia, by, 1963, white, was, widely, accepted, as, the, major, australian, literary, novelist, a, d, hope, called, him, unquestionably, the, best, known, and, most, discussed, novelist, of, the, day, and, thought, his, success, was, indicative, of, a, break, with, the, naturalistic, tradition, which, has, dominated, australian, fiction, since, the, turn, of, the, century, and, may, well, be, a, portent, of, a, more, imaginative, and, a, more, intellectual, sort, of, fiction, white, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, 1973, academic, elizabeth, webby, states, that, many, critics, consider, the, twyborn, affair, the, best, of, his, subsequent, work, katherine, brisbane, states, that, the, reception, of, white, s, plays, has, been, ambivalent, as, they, mix, realism, expressionism, and, poetic, and, vernacular, dialogue, in, a, way, which, has, challenged, audiences, and, directors, the, ham, funeral, 1947, was, successfully, produced, in, 1962, after, it, was, rejected, by, the, adelaide, festival, for, obscenity, it, was, successfully, revived, in, 1989, the, season, at, sarsaparilla, 1962, has, been, his, most, produced, play, according, to, critic, brian, kiernan, the, basic, situation, in, his, fiction, is, the, attempt, of, individuals, most, often, individuals, alienated, from, society, to, grasp, some, higher, more, essential, reality, that, lies, beyond, or, behind, social, existence, the, search, for, a, higher, reality, is, most, often, presented, as, an, exploration, of, various, forms, of, religious, or, mystical, experience, and, the, seers, are, variously, pioneer, settlers, the, tree, of, man, explorers, voss, artists, the, vivisector, the, simple, minded, the, solid, mandala, those, fleeing, into, the, self, the, aunt, s, story, or, those, on, the, margins, of, society, sexual, ambivalence, and, the, search, for, personal, identity, are, also, recurrent, themes, that, becomes, more, prominent, in, the, later, novels, society, in, particular, australian, society, is, mostly, portrayed, as, materialistic, conformist, and, life, inhibiting, white, satirises, what, he, called, in, 1958, the, great, australian, emptiness, in, which, the, mind, is, the, least, of, possessions, in, which, the, rich, man, is, the, important, man, in, which, the, schoolmaster, and, the, journalist, rule, what, intellectual, roost, there, is, in, which, beautiful, youths, and, girls, stare, at, life, through, blind, blue, eyes, in, which, human, teeth, fall, like, autumn, leaves, the, buttocks, of, cars, grow, hourly, glassier, food, means, cake, and, steak, muscles, prevail, and, the, march, of, material, ugliness, does, not, raise, a, quiver, from, the, average, nerves, the, academic, mark, williams, argues, that, white, places, the, religious, impulse, at, the, centre, of, the, human, condition, and, his, work, adding, that, religion, is, one, of, the, central, values, along, with, art, and, love, which, he, considers, to, be, denigrated, in, his, homeland, kiernan, notes, a, division, among, critics, over, whether, he, is, essentially, a, simple, and, traditional, writer, who, affirms, a, religious, even, mystical, view, of, life, or, one, who, is, distinctively, modern, sophisticated, and, ironic, continually, exploring, transcendent, possibilities, but, with, detachment, and, even, scepticism, greg, clarke, argues, that, christian, discourse, is, central, to, white, s, writing, marr, williams, and, kiernan, however, state, that, white, drew, on, various, religious, and, mystical, traditions, in, his, work, including, judaism, jungian, archetypes, and, gnosticism, white, s, early, novels, were, heavily, influenced, by, the, modernism, of, eliot, joyce, lawrence, and, woolf, kiernan, has, called, his, mature, work, complex, ambiguous, and, ironic, verbal, structures, his, narratives, shift, seamlessly, between, past, and, present, inner, experience, and, outer, awareness, and, the, point, of, view, of, different, characters, according, to, williams, the, point, of, view, of, the, narrative, in, any, white, novel, changes, continually, rapidly, and, disconcertingly, the, narrative, voice, is, a, voice, composed, of, many, voices, a, slippery, complex, fluent, medium, white, frequently, shifts, between, tones, styles, and, linguistic, registers, according, to, kiernan, a, self, conscious, play, with, conventions, a, parodic, playfulness, is, apparent, through, white, s, adoption, of, various, modes, in, his, work, from, the, first, his, transitions, between, realist, expressionist, symbolist, and, romantic, modes, were, a, conscious, attempt, to, demonstrate, that, the, australian, novel, is, not, necessarily, the, dreary, dun, coloured, offspring, of, journalistic, realism, kiernan, states, that, in, voss, the, theme, of, the, outsider, as, visionary, explorer, of, the, human, condition, is, undercut, by, ironic, comedy, and, parodies, of, the, gothic, excess, of, romantic, literature, williams, argues, that, white, s, tendency, for, parody, and, playfulness, become, more, prominent, in, later, works, such, as, the, twyborn, affair, and, memoirs, of, many, in, one, the, tone, becomes, less, portentous, and, more, relaxed, and, the, works, more, self, referential, critic, susan, lever, considers, white, a, pivotal, figure, in, australian, literature, stating, that, he, made, the, novel, rather, than, poetry, the, pre, eminent, literary, form, he, transformed, the, possibilities, of, the, australian, novel, by, demonstrating, that, it, was, a, place, to, test, ideas, against, complex, spiritual, psychological, and, emotional, experience, not, only, an, avenue, for, national, storytelling, australian, novelists, influenced, by, white, include, thomas, keneally, thea, astley, randolph, stow, and, christopher, koch, lever, argues, that, the, following, generations, of, novelists, were, more, influenced, by, recent, trends, in, world, literature, novelist, david, malouf, states, that, white, s, high, modernism, is, a, literary, form, that, has, become, unfashionable, but, that, this, could, change, writing, in, 2024, critic, martin, thomas, noted, that, critical, and, public, interest, in, white, had, declined, the, patrick, white, award, is, an, annual, literary, prize, which, white, founded, in, 1975, with, the, prize, money, from, his, nobel, prize, it, is,
