mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and, catholic, writer, pascal, was, a, child, prodigy, who, was, educated, by, his, father, a, tax, collector, in, rouen, his, earliest, mathematical, work, was, on, projective, geometry, he, wrote, a, significant, treatise, on, the, subject, of, conic, sections, at, the, age, of, 16, he, later, corresponded, with, pierre, de, fermat, on, probability, theory, strongly, influencing, the, development, of, modern, economics, and, social, science, in, 1642, he, started, some, pioneering, work, on, calculating, machines, called, pascal, s, calculators, and, later, pascalines, establishing, him, as, one, of, the, first, two, inventors, of, the, mechanical, calculator, like, his, contemporary, ren, descartes, pascal, was, also, a, pioneer, in, the, natural, and, applied, sciences, pascal, wrote, in, defense, of, the, scientific, method, and, produced, several, controversial, results, he, made, important, contributions, to, the, study, of, fluids, and, clarified, the, concepts, of, pressure, and, vacuum, by, generalising, the, work, of, evangelista, torricelli, following, torricelli, and, galileo, galilei, he, rebutted, the, likes, of, aristotle, and, descartes, who, insisted, that, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, in, 1647, in, 1646, he, and, his, sister, jacqueline, identified, with, the, religious, movement, within, catholicism, known, by, its, detractors, as, jansenism, following, a, religious, experience, in, late, 1654, he, began, writing, influential, works, on, philosophy, and, theology, his, two, most, famous, works, date, from, this, period, the, lettres, provinciales, and, the, pens, es, the, former, set, in, the, conflict, between, jansenists, and, jesuits, the, latter, contains, pascal, s, wager, known, in, the, original, as, the, discourse, on, the, machine, a, fideistic, probabilistic, argument, for, why, one, should, believe, in, god, in, that, year, he, also, wrote, an, important, treatise, on, the, arithmetical, triangle, between, 1658, and, 1659, he, wrote, on, the, cycloid, and, its, use, in, calculating, the, volume, of, solids, pascal, was, born, in, clermont, ferrand, which, is, in, france, s, auvergne, region, by, the, massif, central, he, lost, his, mother, antoinette, begon, at, the, age, of, three, his, father, tienne, pascal, also, an, amateur, mathematician, was, a, local, judge, and, member, of, the, noblesse, de, robe, pascal, had, two, sisters, the, younger, jacqueline, and, the, elder, gilberte, in, 1631, five, years, after, the, death, of, his, wife, tienne, pascal, moved, with, his, children, to, paris, the, newly, arrived, family, soon, hired, louise, delfault, a, maid, who, eventually, became, a, key, member, of, the, family, tienne, who, never, remarried, decided, that, he, alone, would, educate, his, children, the, young, pascal, showed, an, extraordinary, intellectual, ability, with, an, amazing, aptitude, for, mathematics, and, science, etienne, had, tried, to, keep, his, son, from, learning, mathematics, but, by, the, age, of, 12, pascal, had, rediscovered, on, his, own, using, charcoal, on, a, tile, floor, euclid, s, first, thirty, two, geometric, propositions, and, was, thus, given, a, copy, of, euclid, s, elements, particularly, of, interest, to, pascal, was, a, work, of, desargues, on, conic, sections, following, desargues, thinking, the, 16, year, old, pascal, produced, as, a, means, of, proof, a, short, treatise, on, what, was, called, the, mystic, hexagram, essai, pour, les, coniques, essay, on, conics, and, sent, it, his, first, serious, work, of, mathematics, to, p, re, mersenne, in, paris, it, is, known, still, today, as, pascal, s, theorem, it, states, that, if, a, hexagon, is, inscribed, in, a, circle, or, conic, then, the, three, intersection, points, of, opposite, sides, lie, on, a, line, called, the, pascal, line, pascal, s, work, was, so, precocious, that, ren, descartes, was, convinced, that, pascal, s, father, had, written, it, when, assured, by, mersenne, that, it, was, indeed, the, product, of, the, son, and, not, the, father, descartes, dismissed, it, with, a, sniff, i, do, not, find, it, strange, that, he, has, offered, demonstrations, about, conics, more, appropriate, than, those, of, the, ancients, adding, but, other, matters, related, to, this, subject, can, be, proposed, that, would, scarcely, occur, to, a, 16, year, old, child, in, france, at, that, time, offices, and, positions, could, be, and, were, bought, and, sold, in, 1631, tienne, sold, his, position, as, second, president, of, the, cour, des, aides, for, 65, 665, livres, the, money, was, invested, in, a, government, bond, which, provided, if, not, a, lavish, then, certainly, a, comfortable, income, which, allowed, the, pascal, family, to, move, to, and, enjoy, paris, but, in, 1638, cardinal, richelieu, desperate, for, money, to, carry, on, the, thirty, years, war, defaulted, on, the, government, s, bonds, suddenly, tienne, pascal, s, worth, had, dropped, from, nearly, 66, 000, livres, to, less, than, 7, 300, like, so, many, others, tienne, was, eventually, forced, to, flee, paris, because, of, his, opposition, to, the, fiscal, policies, of, richelieu, leaving, his, three, children, in, the, care, of, his, neighbour, madame, sainctot, a, great, beauty, with, an, infamous, past, who, kept, one, of, the, most, glittering, and, intellectual, salons, in, all, france, it, was, only, when, jacqueline, performed, well, in, a, children, s, play, with, richelieu, in, attendance, that, tienne, was, pardoned, in, time, tienne, was, back, in, good, graces, with, the, cardinal, and, in, 1639, had, been, appointed, the, king, s, commissioner, of, taxes, in, the, city, of, rouen, a, city, whose, tax, records, thanks, to, uprisings, were, in, utter, chaos, in, 1642, in, an, effort, to, ease, his, father, s, endless, exhausting, calculations, and, recalculations, of, taxes, owed, and, paid, into, which, work, the, young, pascal, had, been, recruited, pascal, not, yet, 19, constructed, a, mechanical, calculator, capable, of, addition, and, subtraction, called, pascal, s, calculator, or, the, pascaline, of, the, eight, pascalines, known, to, have, survived, four, are, held, by, the, mus, e, des, arts, et, m, tiers, in, paris, and, one, more, by, the, zwinger, museum, in, dresden, germany, exhibit, two, of, his, original, mechanical, calculators, although, these, machines, are, pioneering, forerunners, to, a, further, 400, years, of, development, of, mechanical, methods, of, calculation, and, in, a, sense, to, the, later, field, of, computer, engineering, the, calculator, failed, to, be, a, great, commercial, success, partly, because, it, was, still, quite, cumbersome, to, use, in, practice, but, probably, primarily, because, it, was, extraordinarily, expensive, the, pascaline, became, little, more, than, a, toy, and, a, status, symbol, for, the, very, rich, both, in, france, and, elsewhere, in, europe, pascal, continued, to, make, improvements, to, his, design, through, the, next, decade, and, he, refers, to, some, 50, machines, that, were, built, to, his, design, he, built, 20, finished, machines, over, the, following, 10, years, pascal, s, development, of, probability, theory, was, his, most, influential, contribution, to, mathematics, originally, applied, to, gambling, today, it, is, extremely, important, in, economics, especially, in, actuarial, science, john, ross, writes, probability, theory, and, the, discoveries, following, it, changed, the, way, we, regard, uncertainty, risk, decision, making, and, an, individual, s, and, society, s, ability, to, influence, the, course, of, future, events, however, pascal, and, fermat, though, doing, important, early, work, in, probability, theory, did, not, develop, the, field, very, far, christiaan, huygens, learning, of, the, subject, from, the, correspondence, of, pascal, and, fermat, wrote, the, first, book, on, the, subject, later, figures, who, continued, the, development, of, the, theory, include, abraham, de, moivre, and, pierre, simon, laplace, in, 1654, prompted, by, his, friend, the, chevalier, de, m, r, pascal, corresponded, with, pierre, de, fermat, on, the, subject, of, gambling, problems, and, from, that, collaboration, was, born, the, mathematical, theory, of, probabilities, the, specific, problem, was, that, of, two, players, who, want, to, finish, a, game, early, and, given, the, current, circumstances, of, the, game, want, to, divide, the, stakes, fairly, based, on, the, chance, each, has, of, winning, the, game, from, that, point, from, this, discussion, the, notion, of, expected, value, was, introduced, pascal, later, in, the, pens, es, used, a, probabilistic, argument, pascal, s, wager, to, justify, belief, in, god, and, a, virtuous, life, the, work, done, by, fermat, and, pascal, into, the, calculus, of, probabilities, laid, important, groundwork, for, leibniz, formulation, of, the, calculus, pascal, s, trait, du, triangle, arithm, tique, written, in, 1654, but, published, posthumously, in, 1665, described, a, convenient, tabular, presentation, for, binomial, coefficients, which, he, called, the, arithmetical, triangle, but, is, now, called, pascal, s, triangle, the, triangle, can, also, be, represented, he, defined, the, numbers, in, the, triangle, by, recursion, call, the, number, in, the, m, 1, th, row, and, n, 1, th, column, t, mn, then, t, mn, t, m, 1, n, t, m, n, 1, for, m, 0, 1, 2, and, n, 0, 1, 2, the, boundary, conditions, are, t, m, 1, 0, t, 1, n, 0, for, m, 1, 2, 3, and, n, 1, 2, 3, the, generator, t, 00, 1, pascal, concluded, with, the, proof, in, the, same, treatise, pascal, gave, an, explicit, statement, of, the, principle, of, mathematical, induction, in, 1654, he, proved, pascal, s, identity, relating, the, sums, of, the, p, th, powers, of, the, first, n, positive, integers, for, p, 0, 1, 2, k, that, same, year, pascal, had, a, religious, experience, and, mostly, gave, up, work, in, mathematics, in, 1658, pascal, while, suffering, from, a, toothache, began, considering, several, problems, concerning, the, cycloid, his, toothache, disappeared, and, he, took, this, as, a, heavenly, sign, to, proceed, with, his, research, eight, days, later, he, had, completed, his, essay, and, to, publicize, the, results, proposed, a, contest, pascal, proposed, three, questions, relating, to, the, center, of, gravity, area, and, volume, of, the, cycloid, with, the, winner, or, winners, to, receive, prizes, of, 20, and, 40, spanish, doubloons, pascal, gilles, de, roberval, and, pierre, de, carcavi, were, the, judges, and, neither, of, the, two, submissions, by, john, wallis, and, antoine, de, lalouv, re, were, judged, to, be, adequate, while, the, contest, was, ongoing, christopher, wren, sent, pascal, a, proposal, for, a, proof, of, the, rectification, of, the, cycloid, roberval, claimed, promptly, that, he, had, known, of, the, proof, for, years, wallis, published, wren, s, proof, crediting, wren, in, wallis, s, tractus, duo, giving, wren, priority, for, the, first, published, proof, pascal, contributed, to, several, fields, in, physics, most, notably, the, fields, of, fluid, mechanics, and, pressure, in, honour, of, his, scientific, contributions, the, name, pascal, has, been, given, to, the, si, unit, of, pressure, and, pascal, s, law, an, important, principle, of, hydrostatics, he, introduced, a, primitive, form, of, roulette, and, the, roulette, wheel, in, his, search, for, a, perpetual, motion, machine, his, work, in, the, fields, of, hydrodynamics, and, hydrostatics, centered, on, the, principles, of, hydraulic, fluids, his, inventions, include, the, hydraulic, press, using, hydraulic, pressure, to, multiply, force, and, the, syringe, he, proved, that, hydrostatic, pressure, depends, not, on, the, weight, of, the, fluid, but, on, the, elevation, difference, he, demonstrated, this, principle, by, attaching, a, thin, tube, to, a, barrel, full, of, water, and, filling, the, tube, with, water, up, to, the, level, of, the, third, floor, of, a, building, this, caused, the, barrel, to, leak, in, what, became, known, as, pascal, s, barrel, experiment, by, 1647, pascal, had, learned, of, evangelista, torricelli, s, experimentation, with, barometers, having, replicated, an, experiment, that, involved, placing, a, tube, filled, with, mercury, upside, down, in, a, bowl, of, mercury, pascal, questioned, what, force, kept, some, mercury, in, the, tube, and, what, filled, the, space, above, the, mercury, in, the, tube, at, the, time, most, scientists, including, descartes, believed, in, a, plenum, i, e, some, invisible, matter, filled, all, of, space, rather, than, a, vacuum, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, this, was, based, on, the, aristotelian, notion, that, everything, in, motion, was, a, substance, moved, by, another, substance, furthermore, light, passed, through, the, glass, tube, suggesting, a, substance, such, as, aether, rather, than, vacuum, filled, the, space, following, more, experimentation, in, this, vein, in, 1647, pascal, produced, experiences, nouvelles, touchant, le, vide, new, experiments, with, the, vacuum, which, detailed, basic, rules, describing, to, what, degree, various, liquids, could, be, supported, by, air, pressure, it, also, provided, reasons, why, it, was, indeed, a, vacuum, above, the, column, of, liquid, in, a, barometer, tube, this, work, was, followed, by, r, cit, de, la, grande, exp, rience, de, l, quilibre, des, liqueurs, account, of, the, great, experiment, on, equilibrium, in, liquids, published, in, 1648, the, torricellian, vacuum, found, that, air, pressure, is, equal, to, the, weight, of, 30, inches, of, mercury, if, air, has, a, finite, weight, earth, s, atmosphere, must, have, a, maximum, height, pascal, reasoned, that, if, true, air, pressure, on, a, high, mountain, must, be, less, than, at, a, lower, altitude, he, lived, near, the, puy, de, d, me, mountain, 4, 790, feet, 1, 460, m, tall, but, his, health, was, poor, so, could, not, climb, it, on, 19, september, 1648, after, many, months, of, pascal, s, friendly, but, insistent, prodding, florin, p, rier, husband, of, pascal, s, elder, sister, gilberte, was, finally, able, to, carry, out, the, fact, finding, mission, vital, to, pascal, s, theory, the, account, written, by, p, rier, reads, the, weather, was, chancy, last, saturday, around, five, o, clock, that, morning, the, puy, de, d, me, was, visible, so, i, decided, to, give, it, a, try, several, important, people, of, the, city, of, clermont, had, asked, me, to, let, them, know, when, i, would, make, the, ascent, i, was, delighted, to, have, them, with, me, in, this, great, work, at, eight, o, clock, we, met, in, the, gardens, of, the, minim, fathers, which, has, the, lowest, elevation, in, town, first, i, poured, 16, pounds, of, quicksilver, into, a, vessel, then, took, several, glass, tubes, each, four, feet, long, and, hermetically, sealed, at, one, end, and, opened, at, the, other, then, placed, them, in, the, vessel, i, found, the, quick, silver, stood, at, 26, and, 3, 1, 2, lines, above, the, quicksilver, in, the, vessel, i, repeated, the, experiment, two, more, times, while, standing, in, the, same, spot, produced, the, same, result, each, time, i, attached, one, of, the, tubes, to, the, vessel, and, marked, the, height, of, the, quicksilver, and, asked, father, chastin, one, of, the, minim, brothers, to, watch, if, any, changes, should, occur, through, the, day, taking, the, other, tube, and, a, portion, of, the, quick, silver, i, walked, to, the, top, of, puy, de, d, me, about, 500, fathoms, higher, than, the, monastery, where, upon, experiment, found, that, the, quicksilver, reached, a, height, of, only, 23, and, 2, lines, i, repeated, the, experiment, five, times, with, care, each, at, different, points, on, the, summit, found, the, same, height, of, quicksilver, in, each, case, pascal, replicated, the, experiment, in, paris, by, carrying, a, barometer, up, to, the, top, of, the, bell, tower, at, the, church, of, saint, jacques, de, la, boucherie, a, height, of, about, 50, metres, the, mercury, dropped, two, lines, he, found, with, both, experiments, that, an, ascent, of, 7, fathoms, lowers, the, mercury, by, half, a, line, note, pascal, used, pouce, and, ligne, for, inch, and, line, and, toise, for, fathom, in, a, reply, to, tienne, no, l, who, believed, in, the, plenum, pascal, wrote, echoing, contemporary, notions, of, science, and, falsifiability, in, order, to, show, that, a, hypothesis, is, evident, it, does, not, suffice, that, all, the, phenomena, follow, from, it, instead, if, it, leads, to, something, contrary, to, a, single, one, of, the, phenomena, that, suffices, to, establish, its, falsity, blaise, pascal, chairs, are, given, to, outstanding, international, scientists, to, conduct, their, research, in, the, ile, de, france, region, in, the, winter, of, 1646, pascal, s, 58, year, old, father, broke, his, hip, when, he, slipped, and, fell, on, an, icy, street, of, rouen, given, the, man, s, age, and, the, state, of, medicine, in, the, 17th, century, a, broken, hip, could, be, a, very, serious, condition, perhaps, even, fatal, rouen, was, home, to, two, of, the, finest, doctors, in, france, deslandes, and, de, la, bouteillerie, the, elder, pascal, would, not, let, anyone, other, than, these, men, attend, him, it, was, a, good, choice, for, the, old, man, survived, and, was, able, to, walk, again, however, treatment, and, rehabilitation, took, three, months, during, which, time, la, bouteillerie, and, deslandes, had, become, regular, visitors, both, men, were, followers, of, jean, guillebert, proponent, of, a, splinter, group, from, catholic, teaching, known, as, jansenism, this, still, fairly, small, sect, was, making, surprising, inroads, into, the, french, catholic, community, at, that, time, it, espoused, rigorous, augustinism, blaise, spoke, with, the, doctors, frequently, and, after, their, successful, treatment, of, his, father, borrowed, from, them, works, by, jansenist, authors, in, this, period, pascal, experienced, a, sort, of, first, conversion, and, began, to, write, on, theological, subjects, in, the, course, of, the, following, year, pascal, fell, away, from, this, initial, religious, engagement, and, experienced, a, few, years, of, what, some, biographers, have, called, his, worldly, period, 1648, 54, his, father, died, in, 1651, and, left, his, inheritance, to, pascal, and, his, sister, jacqueline, for, whom, pascal, acted, as, conservator, jacqueline, announced, that, she, would, soon, become, a, postulant, in, the, jansenist, convent, of, port, royal, pascal, was, deeply, affected, and, very, sad, not, because, of, her, choice, but, because, of, his, chronic, poor, health, he, needed, her, just, as, she, had, needed, him, suddenly, there, was, war, in, the, pascal, household, blaise, pleaded, with, jacqueline, not, to, leave, but, she, was, adamant, he, commanded, her, to, stay, but, that, didn, t, work, either, at, the, heart, of, this, was, blaise, s, fear, of, abandonment, if, jacqueline, entered, port, royal, she, would, have, to, leave, her, inheritance, behind, nothing, would, change, her, mind, by, the, end, of, october, in, 1651, a, truce, had, been, reached, between, brother, and, sister, in, return, for, a, healthy, annual, stipend, jacqueline, signed, over, her, part, of, the, inheritance, to, her, brother, gilberte, had, already, been, given, her, inheritance, in, the, form, of, a, dowry, in, early, january, jacqueline, left, for, port, royal, on, that, day, according, to, gilberte, concerning, her, brother, he, retired, very, sadly, to, his, rooms, without, seeing, jacqueline, who, was, waiting, in, the, little, parlor, in, early, june, 1653, after, what, must, have, seemed, like, endless, badgering, from, jacqueline, pascal, formally, signed, over, the, whole, of, his, sister, s, inheritance, to, port, royal, which, to, him, had, begun, to, smell, like, a, cult, with, two, thirds, of, his, father, s, estate, now, gone, the, 29, year, old, pascal, was, now, consigned, to, genteel, poverty, for, a, while, pascal, pursued, the, life, of, a, bachelor, during, visits, to, his, sister, at, port, royal, in, 1654, he, displayed, contempt, for, affairs, of, the, world, but, was, not, drawn, to, god, on, the, 23, of, november, 1654, between, 10, 30, and, 12, 30, at, night, pascal, had, an, intense, religious, experience, and, immediately, wrote, a, brief, note, to, himself, which, began, fire, god, of, abraham, god, of, isaac, god, of, jacob, not, of, the, philosophers, and, the, scholars, and, concluded, by, quoting, psalm, 119, 16, i, will, not, forget, thy, word, amen, he, seems, to, have, carefully, sewn, this, document, into, his, coat, and, always, transferred, it, when, he, changed, clothes, a, servant, discovered, it, only, by, chance, after, his, death, this, piece, is, now, known, as, the, memorial, the, story, of, a, carriage, accident, as, having, led, to, the, experience, described, in, the, memorial, is, disputed, by, some, scholars, his, belief, and, religious, commitment, revitalized, pascal, visited, the, older, of, two, convents, at, port, royal, for, a, two, week, retreat, in, january, 1655, for, the, next, four, years, he, regularly, travelled, between, port, royal, and, paris, it, was, at, this, point, immediately, after, his, conversion, when, he, began, writing, his, first, major, literary, work, on, religion, the, provincial, letters, in, literature, pascal, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, authors, of, the, french, classical, period, and, is, read, today, as, one, of, the, greatest, masters, of, french, prose, his, use, of, satire, and, wit, influenced, later, polemicists, beginning, in, 1656, 57, pascal, published, his, memorable, attack, on, casuistry, a, popular, ethical, method, used, by, catholic, thinkers, in, the, early, modern, period, especially, the, jesuits, and, in, particular, antonio, escobar, pascal, denounced, casuistry, as, the, mere, use, of, complex, reasoning, to, justify, moral, laxity, and, all, sorts, of, sins, the, 18, letter, series, was, published, between, 1656, and, 1657, under, the, pseudonym, louis, de, montalte, and, incensed, louis, xiv, the, king, ordered, that, the, book, be, shredded, and, burnt, in, 1660, in, 1661, in, the, midst, of, the, formulary, controversy, the, jansenist, school, at, port, royal, was, condemned, and, closed, down, those, involved, with, the, school, had, to, sign, a, 1656, papal, bull, condemning, the, teachings, of, jansen, as, heretical, the, final, letter, from, pascal, in, 1657, had, defied, alexander, vii, himself, even, pope, alexander, while, publicly, opposing, them, nonetheless, was, persuaded, by, pascal, s, arguments, aside, from, their, religious, influence, the, provincial, letters, were, popular, as, a, literary, work, pascal, s, use, of, humor, mockery, and, vicious, satire, in, his, arguments, made, the, letters, ripe, for, public, consumption, and, influenced, the, prose, of, later, french, writers, like, voltaire, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, it, is, in, the, provincial, letters, that, pascal, made, his, oft, quoted, apology, for, writing, a, long, letter, as, he, had, not, had, time, to, write, a, shorter, one, from, letter, xvi, as, translated, by, thomas, m, crie, reverend, fathers, my, letters, were, not, wont, either, to, be, so, prolix, or, to, follow, so, closely, on, one, another, want, of, time, must, plead, my, excuse, for, both, of, these, faults, the, present, letter, is, a, very, long, one, simply, because, i, had, no, leisure, to, make, it, shorter, charles, perrault, wrote, of, the, letters, everything, is, there, purity, of, language, nobility, of, thought, solidity, in, reasoning, finesse, in, raillery, and, throughout, an, agr, ment, not, to, be, found, anywhere, else, pascal, is, arguably, best, known, as, a, philosopher, considered, by, some, the, second, greatest, french, mind, behind, ren, descartes, he, was, a, dualist, following, descartes, however, he, is, also, remembered, for, his, opposition, to, both, the, rationalism, of, the, likes, of, descartes, and, simultaneous, opposition, to, the, main, countervailing, epistemology, empiricism, preferring, fideism, in, terms, of, god, descartes, and, pascal, disagreed, pascal, wrote, that, i, cannot, forgive, descartes, in, all, his, philosophy, he, would, have, been, quite, willing, to, dispense, with, god, but, he, couldn, t, avoid, letting, him, put, the, world, in, motion, afterwards, he, didn, t, need, god, anymore, he, opposed, the, rationalism, of, people, like, descartes, as, applied, to, the, existence, of, a, god, preferring, faith, as, reason, can, decide, nothing, here, for, pascal, the, nature, of, god, was, such, that, such, proofs, cannot, reveal, god, humans, are, in, darkness, and, estranged, from, god, because, he, has, hidden, himself, from, their, knowledge, he, cared, above, all, about, the, philosophy, of, religion, pascalian, theology, has, grown, out, of, his, perspective, that, humans, are, according, to, wood, born, into, a, duplicitous, world, that, shapes, us, into, duplicitous, subjects, and, so, we, find, it, easy, to, reject, god, continually, and, deceive, ourselves, about, our, own, sinfulness, pascal, s, major, contribution, to, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, came, with, his, de, l, esprit, g, om, trique, of, the, geometrical, spirit, originally, written, as, a, preface, to, a, geometry, textbook, for, one, of, the, famous, petites, coles, de, port, royal, little, schools, of, port, royal, the, work, was, unpublished, until, over, a, century, after, his, death, here, pascal, looked, into, the, issue, of, discovering, truths, arguing, that, the, ideal, of, such, a, method, would, be, to, found, all, propositions, on, already, established, truths, at, the, same, time, however, he, claimed, this, was, impossible, because, such, established, truths, would, require, other, truths, to, back, them, up, first, principles, therefore, cannot, be, reached, based, on, this, pascal, argued, that, the, procedure, used, in, geometry, was, as, perfect, as, possible, with, certain, principles, assumed, and, other, propositions, developed, from, them, nevertheless, there, was, no, way, to, know, the, assumed, principles, to, be, true, pascal, also, used, de, l, esprit, g, om, trique, to, develop, a, theory, of, definition, he, distinguished, between, definitions, which, are, conventional, labels, defined, by, the, writer, and, definitions, which, are, within, the, language, and, understood, by, everyone, because, they, naturally, designate, their, referent, the, second, type, would, be, characteristic, of, the, philosophy, of, essentialism, pascal, claimed, that, only, definitions, of, the, first, type, were, important, to, science, and, mathematics, arguing, that, those, fields, should, adopt, the, philosophy, of, formalism, as, formulated, by, descartes, in, de, l, art, de, persuader, on, the, art, of, persuasion, pascal, looked, deeper, into, geometry, s, axiomatic, method, specifically, the, question, of, how, people, come, to, be, convinced, of, the, axioms, upon, which, later, conclusions, are, based, pascal, agreed, with, montaigne, that, achieving, certainty, in, these, axioms, and, conclusions, through, human, methods, is, impossible, he, asserted, that, these, principles, can, be, grasped, only, through, intuition, and, that, this, fact, underscored, the, necessity, for, submission, to, god, in, searching, out, truths, man, is, only, a, reed, the, weakest, in, nature, but, he, is, a, thinking, reed, pascal, s, most, influential, theological, work, referred, to, posthumously, as, the, pens, es, thoughts, is, widely, considered, to, be, a, masterpiece, and, a, landmark, in, french, prose, when, commenting, on, one, particular, section, thought, 72, sainte, beuve, praised, it, as, the, finest, pages, in, the, french, language, will, durant, hailed, the, pens, es, as, the, most, eloquent, book, in, french, prose, the, pens, es, was, not, completed, before, his, death, it, was, to, have, been, a, sustained, and, coherent, examination, and, defense, of, the, christian, faith, with, the, original, title, apologie, de, la, religion, chr, tienne, defense, of, the, christian, religion, the, first, version, of, the, numerous, scraps, of, paper, found, after, his, death, appeared, in, print, as, a, book, in, 1669, titled, pens, es, de, m, pascal, sur, la, religion, et, sur, quelques, autres, sujets, thoughts, of, m, pascal, on, religion, and, on, some, other, subjects, and, soon, thereafter, became, a, classic, one, of, the, apologie, s, main, strategies, was, to, use, the, contradictory, philosophies, of, pyrrhonism, and, stoicism, personalized, by, montaigne, on, one, hand, and, epictetus, on, the, other, in, order, to, bring, the, unbeliever, to, such, despair, and, confusion, that, he, would, embrace, god, t, s, eliot, described, him, during, this, phase, of, his, life, as, a, man, of, the, world, among, ascetics, and, an, ascetic, among, men, of, the, world, pascal, s, ascetic, lifestyle, derived, from, a, belief, that, it, was, natural, and, necessary, for, a, person, to, suffer, in, 1659, pascal, fell, seriously, ill, during, his, last, years, he, frequently, tried, to, reject, the, ministrations, of, his, doctors, saying, don, t, pity, me, sickness, is, the, natural, state, of, christians, because, in, it, we, are, as, we, should, always, be, in, the, suffering, of, evils, in, the, deprivation, of, all, the, goods, and, pleasures, of, the, senses, free, from, all, the, passions, that, work, throughout, the, course, of, life, without, ambition, without, avarice, in, the, continual, expectation, of, death, desiring, to, imitate, jesus, poverty, of, spirit, in, his, spirit, of, zeal, and, charity, pascal, said, if, god, allowed, him, to, recover, from, his, illness, he, would, be, resolved, to, have, no, other, employment, or, occupation, for, the, rest, of, my, life, than, the, service, of, the, poor, louis, xiv, suppressed, the, jansenist, movement, at, port, royal, in, 1661, in, response, pascal, wrote, one, of, his, final, works, crit, sur, la, signature, du, formulaire, writ, on, the, signing, of, the, form, exhorting, the, jansenists, not, to, give, in, later, that, year, his, sister, jacqueline, died, which, convinced, pascal, to, cease, his, polemics, on, jansenism, pascal, s, last, major, achievement, returning, to, his, mechanical, genius, was, inaugurating, perhaps, the, first, bus, line, the, carrosses, cinq, sols, moving, passengers, within, paris, in, a, carriage, with, many, seats, pascal, also, designated, the, operation, principles, which, were, later, used, to, plan, public, transportation, the, carriages, had, a, fixed, route, fixed, price, and, left, even, if, there, were, no, passengers, it, is, widely, considered, that, the, idea, of, public, transportation, was, well, ahead, of, time, the, lines, were, not, commercially, successful, and, the, last, one, closed, by, 1675, in, 1662, pascal, s, illness, became, more, violent, and, his, emotional, condition, had, severely, worsened, since, his, sister, s, death, aware, that, his, health, was, fading, quickly, he, sought, a, move, to, the, hospital, for, incurable, diseases, but, his, doctors, declared, that, he, was, too, unstable, to, be, carried, in, paris, on, 18, august, 1662, pascal, went, into, convulsions, and, received, extreme, unction, he, died, the, next, morning, his, last, words, being, may, god, never, abandon, me, and, was, buried, in, the, cemetery, of, saint, tienne, du, mont, an, autopsy, performed, after, his, death, revealed, grave, problems, with, his, stomach, and, other, organs, of, his, abdomen, along, with, damage, to, his, brain, despite, the, autopsy, the, cause, of, his, poor, health, was, never, precisely, determined, though, speculation, focuses, on, tuberculosis, stomach, cancer, or, a, combination, of, the, two, the, headaches, which, affected, pascal, are, generally, attributed, to, his, brain, lesion, one, of, the,
