publius, terentius, afer, t, r, n, i, s, s, c, 195, 185, c, 159, bc, better, known, in, english, as, terence, t, r, n, s, was, a, playwright, during, the, roman, republic, he, was, the, author, of, six, comedies, based, on, greek, originals, by, menander, or, apollodorus, of, carystus, terence, s, plays, were, originally, staged, around, 166, 160, bc, according, to, ancient, authors, terence, was, born, in, carthage, and, was, brought, to, rome, as, a, slave, where, he, gained, an, education, and, his, freedom, around, the, age, of, 25, terence, is, said, to, have, made, a, voyage, to, the, east, in, search, of, inspiration, for, his, plays, where, he, died, either, of, disease, in, greece, or, by, shipwreck, on, the, return, voyage, however, terence, s, traditional, biography, is, often, thought, to, consist, of, speculation, by, ancient, scholars, who, lived, too, long, after, terence, to, have, access, to, reliable, facts, about, his, life, terence, s, plays, quickly, became, standard, school, texts, he, ultimately, secured, a, place, as, one, of, the, four, authors, taught, to, all, grammar, pupils, in, the, western, roman, empire, and, retained, a, central, place, in, the, european, school, curriculum, until, the, 19th, century, exercising, a, formative, influence, on, authors, such, as, william, shakespeare, and, moli, re, the, manuscripts, of, terence, s, plays, contain, didascaliae, or, production, notices, recording, the, dates, occasions, and, personnel, of, early, productions, of, the, plays, and, identifying, the, author, of, the, greek, original, other, traditional, information, about, the, life, of, terence, derives, from, the, vita, terenti, a, biography, preserved, in, aelius, donatus, commentary, and, attributed, by, him, to, suetonius, however, it, is, not, likely, that, terence, s, contemporaries, would, have, considered, a, dramatist, important, enough, to, write, down, his, biography, for, posterity, and, the, narrative, given, by, suetonius, sources, is, often, construed, as, conjecture, based, on, the, play, texts, and, didascaliae, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, plays, were, regular, features, of, four, annual, roman, festivals, the, ludi, romani, september, the, ludi, plebeii, november, the, ludi, apollinares, july, and, the, ludi, megalenses, april, plays, would, also, be, staged, at, votive, games, triumphs, and, the, more, elaborate, aristocratic, funerals, because, the, roman, calendar, ran, some, two, and, a, half, months, ahead, of, the, sun, in, the, 160s, terence, s, plays, that, premiered, at, the, megalensia, though, officially, scheduled, in, april, would, actually, have, premiered, in, late, january, there, was, no, permanent, theatre, in, rome, until, the, construction, of, the, theatre, of, pompey, in, 55, bc, and, terence, s, plays, would, have, been, performed, on, temporary, wooden, stages, constructed, for, the, occasion, the, limited, space, available, would, probably, have, accommodated, an, audience, of, less, than, 2, 000, persons, at, a, given, performance, admission, was, free, to, the, entire, population, seemingly, on, a, first, come, first, served, basis, except, for, the, reservation, of, seats, for, members, of, the, senate, after, 194, bc, descriptions, of, 2nd, century, theatre, audiences, refer, to, the, presence, of, women, children, slaves, and, the, urban, poor, in, greek, new, comedy, from, which, the, roman, comic, tradition, derived, actors, wore, masks, which, were, conventionally, associated, with, stock, character, types, ancient, authors, make, conflicting, statements, on, whether, roman, actors, also, wore, masks, in, the, time, of, terence, for, a, time, christian, hoffer, s, 1877, dissertation, on, the, use, of, masks, in, publius, terentius, comedies, won, universal, acceptance, for, the, view, that, masks, were, not, worn, at, the, original, performances, of, the, plays, of, terence, however, most, more, recent, authorities, consider, it, highly, likely, that, roman, actors, of, terence, s, time, did, wear, masks, when, performing, this, kind, of, play, and, hard, to, believe, or, even, inconceivable, that, they, did, not, donatus, states, that, the, actors, wore, masks, in, the, original, productions, of, the, eunuchus, and, the, adelphoe, according, to, the, didascaliae, each, of, terence, s, plays, was, originally, produced, by, the, acting, company, of, lucius, ambivius, turpio, and, musical, accompaniment, for, each, of, the, plays, was, provided, by, a, tibicen, named, flaccus, a, slave, in, the, service, of, a, certain, claudius, the, traditional, and, generally, accepted, chronology, of, the, plays, established, according, to, the, didascaliae, is, as, follows, the, didascalia, for, each, play, also, identifies, its, position, in, the, corpus, by, chronological, order, the, didascaliae, state, that, eunuchus, was, the, second, play, facta, ii, and, heauton, timorumenos, was, the, third, facta, iii, testimony, seemingly, contradicted, by, the, dates, of, production, as, well, as, by, donatus, statement, that, the, eunuchus, was, published, third, edita, tertium, some, scholars, have, explained, the, discrepancy, by, positing, an, unsuccessful, production, of, eunuchus, in, 165, or, 164, bc, or, by, interpreting, the, numbering, in, reference, to, the, order, of, composition, rather, than, the, order, of, production, the, didascalic, numbering, seemingly, discounting, the, unsuccessful, productions, of, hecyra, reckons, it, the, fifth, play, the, didascaliae, also, appear, to, record, some, information, about, revival, performances, at, least, as, late, as, the, 140s, patrick, tansey, has, argued, that, the, didascalia, to, phormio, in, the, codex, bembinus, contains, garbled, names, of, the, consuls, in, 106, bc, which, would, be, the, last, attested, production, of, terence, before, the, renaissance, though, the, consuls, of, 141, bc, had, similar, names, the, greek, plays, which, provided, the, roman, comedians, with, their, material, typically, had, a, prologue, which, either, preceded, the, play, or, interrupted, the, first, act, after, one, or, two, scenes, in, the, plays, of, plautus, the, prologue, usually, but, not, invariably, provides, exposition, of, the, plot, terence, abandons, the, traditional, expository, function, of, the, prologue, entirely, and, uses, it, to, provide, a, different, kind, of, entertainment, centring, on, replies, to, criticism, of, his, work, terence, particularly, refers, the, slanders, he, has, suffered, to, a, certain, old, and, spiteful, poet, because, terence, says, this, man, was, the, translator, of, menander, s, phasma, and, thesaurus, eu, 9, 10, donatus, or, an, earlier, commentator, from, whom, donatus, gleaned, this, information, was, able, to, identify, him, as, luscius, lanuvinus, although, no, names, are, used, in, the, prologues, nothing, survives, of, luscius, work, save, two, lines, of, the, thesaurus, quoted, by, donatus, nor, is, anything, known, about, luscius, independently, of, terence, s, prologues, except, that, volcacius, sedigitus, rated, luscius, the, ninth, best, latin, comic, poet, and, terence, the, sixth, best, terence, s, description, of, luscius, as, old, may, refer, to, a, style, of, play, writing, that, terence, considered, old, fashioned, rather, than, to, advanced, age, terence, s, judgement, of, luscius, work, is, that, by, translating, them, well, and, writing, them, badly, he, has, made, good, greek, plays, into, latin, ones, that, aren, t, good, eu, 7, 8, and, that, luscius, theatrical, successes, were, due, more, to, the, efforts, of, the, actors, than, of, the, author, ph, 9, 11, according, to, suetonius, terence, was, born, in, carthage, he, came, to, rome, as, a, slave, in, the, household, of, an, otherwise, unknown, senator, named, p, terentius, lucanus, who, educated, him, and, freed, him, because, of, his, talent, and, good, looks, terence, then, took, the, nomen, terentius, from, his, patron, possibly, winning, noblemen, s, favour, by, his, youthful, beauty, terence, became, a, member, of, the, so, called, scipionic, circle, when, terence, offered, his, first, play, andria, to, the, aediles, they, bade, him, first, read, it, to, caecilius, terence, shabbily, dressed, went, to, the, older, poet, s, house, when, he, was, dining, and, when, caecilius, had, heard, only, a, few, lines, he, invited, the, young, man, to, join, him, for, the, meal, the, historicity, of, this, meeting, has, been, doubted, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, improbable, terence, with, his, aristocratic, patrons, would, have, been, unable, to, dress, himself, decently, for, such, an, important, interview, a, suspiciously, similar, story, is, told, about, the, tragedians, accius, and, pacuvius, and, jerome, s, statement, that, caecilius, died, the, year, after, ennius, implies, that, caecilius, died, two, years, before, andria, was, produced, however, thomas, carney, argues, that, jerome, s, dating, of, caecilius, death, is, not, above, suspicion, and, besides, a, delay, of, several, years, between, this, meeting, and, production, is, entirely, plausible, as, caecilius, may, have, been, impressed, by, the, novice, playwright, s, work, even, while, the, discussion, showed, terence, the, need, for, revision, r, c, flickinger, argues, that, the, reported, state, of, terence, s, clothing, shows, that, he, had, not, yet, become, acquainted, with, his, rich, and, influential, patrons, at, the, time, of, this, meeting, and, it, was, precisely, caecilius, death, shortly, thereafter, and, the, consequent, loss, of, his, support, which, caused, a, two, year, delay, in, production, all, six, of, terence, s, plays, pleased, the, people, the, eunuchus, earned, 8, 000, nummi, the, highest, price, that, had, ever, been, paid, for, a, comedy, at, rome, and, was, acted, twice, in, the, same, day, donatus, who, appears, to, understand, that, terence, himself, received, this, entire, amount, interprets, the, price, that, suetonius, says, was, paid, for, the, eunuchus, as, 8, 000, sesterces, however, dwora, gilula, argues, that, the, term, nummus, inscribed, on, the, title, page, in, 161, bc, would, refer, to, a, denarius, a, coin, containing, a, much, larger, quantity, of, silver, so, that, the, price, paid, for, the, eunuchus, was, really, 32, 000, sesterces, when, he, was, about, the, age, of, 25, or, according, to, some, manuscripts, 35, terence, travelled, to, greece, or, asia, and, never, returned, suetonius, sources, disagree, about, the, motive, and, destination, of, terence, s, voyage, as, well, as, about, whether, he, died, of, illness, in, greece, or, died, by, shipwreck, on, the, return, voyage, suetonius, places, terence, s, death, in, the, consulship, of, gnaeus, cornelius, dolabella, and, marcus, fulvius, nobilior, i, e, in, 159, bc, it, is, possible, that, the, fateful, voyage, to, greece, was, a, speculative, explanation, of, why, he, wrote, so, few, plays, inferred, from, terence, s, complaint, in, eunuchus, 41, 3, about, the, limited, materials, at, his, disposal, as, transmitted, in, the, manuscript, tradition, the, vita, attributes, the, claim, to, q, cosconius, that, terence, died, by, shipwreck, while, returning, from, greece, cum, c, et, viii, fabulis, conversis, a, menandro, an, expression, interpreted, by, some, to, refer, to, 108, new, plays, that, terence, had, adapted, from, menander, but, by, carney, as, 108, stories, dramatised, by, menander, who, is, credited, with, having, written, exactly, this, number, of, plays, if, this, number, refers, to, new, terentian, plays, it, is, improbable, that, terence, worked, at, such, a, rate, after, having, previously, finished, less, than, one, play, a, year, and, some, editors, delete, the, number, supposing, that, the, numeral, cviii, is, simply, a, double, copying, of, the, preposition, cvm, subsequently, rationalised, as, a, number, terence, was, said, to, have, been, of, moderate, height, slender, and, of, dark, complexion, suetonius, description, of, terence, s, complexion, is, likely, an, inference, from, his, supposed, african, origin, and, his, description, of, the, poet, s, physique, may, have, originated, as, a, metaphor, for, the, lightness, of, his, verse, style, just, as, the, poet, philitas, of, cos, was, said, to, have, weighted, his, shoes, with, lead, lest, he, blow, away, in, the, wind, likenesses, of, terence, found, in, medieval, manuscripts, have, no, authenticity, suetonius, says, that, terence, was, survived, by, a, daughter, who, later, married, a, roman, knight, and, was, said, to, have, left, 20, acres, of, gardens, on, the, appian, way, a, report, contradicted, by, another, of, suetonius, sources, who, says, that, terence, died, poor, ancient, biographers, reports, that, terence, was, born, in, africa, may, be, an, inference, from, his, name, and, not, independent, biographical, information, his, cognomen, afer, the, african, may, indicate, that, terence, hailed, from, ancient, libya, however, such, names, did, not, necessarily, denote, origin, and, there, were, romans, who, had, this, cognomen, who, were, not, africans, such, as, domitius, afer, it, has, often, been, asserted, on, the, basis, of, the, name, that, terence, was, of, berber, descent, as, the, romans, distinguished, between, berbers, called, afri, in, latin, and, carthaginians, called, poeni, however, lexicographic, evidence, does, not, support, the, validity, of, this, distinction, during, terence, s, lifetime, if, terence, was, born, as, a, slave, in, carthage, it, is, possible, his, mother, was, an, ethnic, italian, brought, there, as, a, war, captive, by, hannibal, carney, argues, that, terence, must, have, been, born, from, the, italiote, greek, population, enslaved, by, hannibal, as, this, would, explain, his, proficiency, in, latin, and, greek, f, h, sandbach, notes, that, in, the, modern, world, it, is, rare, but, not, entirely, unknown, for, an, author, to, achieve, literary, distinction, in, a, second, language, terence, s, date, of, birth, is, uncertain, though, sesto, prete, infers, from, terence, s, characterisation, of, himself, as, a, new, writer, eu, 43, and, of, a, rival, poet, as, old, hau, 23, that, terence, was, young, when, he, wrote, his, plays, in, the, 160s, suetonius, statement, that, terence, died, at, about, the, age, of, 25, in, 159, bc, would, imply, that, he, was, born, in, 184, bc, the, same, year, as, the, death, of, plautus, and, was, only, 18, years, old, when, he, produced, his, first, play, the, variant, reading, that, terence, was, in, his, 30s, when, he, died, suggests, instead, that, he, was, born, ten, years, earlier, in, 194, which, would, appear, to, be, supported, by, the, statement, attributed, to, fenestella, that, terence, was, older, than, scipio, and, laelius, jerome, s, chronicon, places, terence, s, death, in, 158, bc, like, plautus, terence, adapted, greek, plays, from, the, late, phases, of, attic, comedy, unlike, plautus, though, terence, s, way, of, writing, his, comedies, was, more, in, a, simple, conversational, latin, pleasant, and, direct, while, less, visually, humorous, to, watch, five, of, terence, s, plays, are, about, a, pair, of, young, men, in, love, in, the, hecyra, there, is, only, one, young, man, who, is, already, married, but, who, suspects, his, wife, of, infidelity, in, all, the, plays, there, are, two, girls, involved, one, a, citizen, woman, the, other, a, prostitute, in, four, of, the, plays, a, recognition, anagnorisis, or, anagnorismos, occurs, which, proves, that, one, of, the, girls, is, the, long, lost, daughter, of, a, respectable, citizen, thus, making, the, way, free, for, her, marriage, terence, s, six, plays, are, saint, jerome, mentions, in, contra, rufinum, i, 16, that, my, teacher, donatus, had, written, a, commentary, on, the, comedies, of, terence, donatus, commentary, does, not, survive, in, the, form, in, which, he, originally, wrote, it, it, is, commonly, believed, that, an, unknown, medieval, scribe, using, two, or, more, manuscripts, of, terence, containing, marginal, notes, excerpted, from, donatus, copied, the, notes, in, order, to, reconstitute, the, commentary, as, a, separate, book, incorporating, extraneous, material, in, the, process, assigning, notes, to, verses, where, they, did, not, originally, belong, or, including, material, that, had, been, otherwise, changed, in, the, course, of, transmission, citations, from, donatus, commentary, which, are, not, found, in, the, extant, redaction, occur, in, priscian, and, in, scholia, to, the, codex, bembinus, and, codex, victorianus, another, ancient, commentary, is, attributed, to, one, eugraphius, of, whom, nothing, is, known, but, his, authorship, of, this, commentary, donatus, commentary, on, the, heauton, timorumenos, is, lacking, but, his, references, to, this, play, in, his, commentary, on, other, parts, of, the, corpus, and, eugraphius, commentary, help, to, make, up, the, gap, in, its, extant, form, donatus, commentary, is, prefaced, by, suetonius, vita, terenti, a, short, essay, on, the, genre, of, comedy, and, its, differences, from, tragedy, now, commonly, called, de, fabula, and, a, separate, shorter, work, on, the, same, subject, which, in, some, manuscripts, begins, with, the, heading, de, comoedia, friedrich, lindenbrog, was, able, to, identify, the, de, fabula, as, the, work, of, an, earlier, commentator, on, terence, named, evanthius, probably, identical, with, the, grammarian, evanthius, said, in, jerome, s, chronicon, to, have, died, at, constantinople, in, ad, 358, because, the, grammarian, rufinus, of, antioch, 5th, cent, ad, in, a, work, on, the, metres, of, terence, quotes, the, de, fabula, and, ascribes, it, to, evanthius, evanthius, work, is, otherwise, lost, the, de, comoedia, has, continued, to, be, considered, the, work, of, donatus, the, manuscripts, of, terence, can, be, divided, into, two, main, groups, one, group, has, just, one, representative, the, codex, bembinus, known, as, a, dating, to, the, 4th, or, early, 5th, century, ad, and, kept, in, the, vatican, library, this, book, written, in, rustic, capitals, is, one, of, the, earliest, surviving, manuscripts, of, any, latin, writer, it, has, the, plays, in, the, order, an, eu, hau, ph, hec, ad, three, small, fragments, of, similar, antiquity, survive, as, well, approximately, 650, manuscripts, exist, of, later, date, these, are, often, known, as, the, calliopian, manuscripts, based, on, subscriptions, to, the, plays, found, in, several, of, the, earlier, manuscripts, indicating, the, text, had, been, corrected, by, someone, named, calliopius, nothing, further, is, known, of, this, individual, they, date, from, the, 9th, century, onwards, and, are, written, in, minuscule, letters, this, group, can, be, subdivided, into, three, classes, the, first, class, known, as, gamma, dates, to, the, 9th, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, and, includes, manuscripts, p, parisinus, c, vaticanus, and, possibly, f, ambrosianus, and, e, riccardianus, among, others, they, have, the, plays, in, the, order, an, eu, hau, ad, hec, ph, manuscript, c, is, the, famous, codex, vaticanus, latinus, 3868, which, has, illustrations, which, seem, to, be, copied, from, originals, dating, in, style, to, the, mid, third, century, another, group, known, as, delta, has, the, plays, in, alphabetical, order, an, ad, eu, ph, f, hau, hec, this, consists, of, 3, or, 4, 10th, century, manuscripts, d, victorianus, g, decurtatus, p, parisinus, and, perhaps, also, l, lipsiensis, all, the, remaining, manuscripts, belong, to, the, mixed, group, and, contain, readings, copied, from, both, and, and, so, are, of, little, value, in, establishing, the, text, it, is, thought, that, the, group, and, the, group, go, back, to, two, archetypes, both, now, lost, called, gamma, and, delta, and, that, both, of, these, were, copied, from, a, single, archetype, also, now, lost, known, as, sigma, according, to, a, j, brothers, manuscript, a, although, it, contains, some, errors, generally, has, a, better, text, than, which, has, a, number, of, changes, designed, perhaps, to, make, terence, easier, to, read, in, schools, both, a, and, the, now, lost, are, believed, to, be, derived, from, an, even, earlier, archetype, known, as, phi, the, date, of, which, is, unknown, in, addition, to, these, manuscripts, there, are, also, certain, commentaries, glossaries, and, quotations, in, ancient, writers, and, grammarians, which, sometimes, assist, editors, in, establishing, the, original, reading, the, best, known, of, these, is, the, commentum, terenti, a, commentary, by, the, 4th, century, grammarian, aelius, donatus, which, is, often, helpful, although, the, part, dealing, with, the, heauton, timorumenos, is, missing, at, a, relatively, early, date, terence, s, play, texts, began, to, circulate, as, literary, works, for, a, reading, public, as, opposed, to, scripts, for, the, use, of, actors, by, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, terence, had, been, established, as, a, literary, classic, and, a, standard, school, text, cicero, born, 106, bc, recalls, that, when, he, was, a, boy, his, education, in, rhetoric, included, an, assignment, to, recount, simo, s, narrative, from, the, first, scene, of, the, andria, in, his, own, words, throughout, the, imperial, period, terence, was, second, only, to, vergil, as, the, most, widely, known, and, read, of, latin, poets, and, he, remained, a, core, school, author, while, other, republican, authors, were, displaced, from, the, curriculum, by, vergil, and, other, augustan, poets, by, the, late, 4th, century, ad, terence, had, become, one, of, the, four, main, canonical, school, authors, the, others, being, cicero, sallust, and, vergil, canonised, in, a, celebrated, work, by, arusianus, messius, and, later, referred, to, by, cassiodorus, as, messius, quadriga, st, jerome, st, augustine, of, hippo, and, the, pupils, of, a, grammarian, friend, of, st, sidonius, apollinaris, were, all, set, to, read, the, eunuchus, in, school, and, in, another, of, his, letters, sidonius, describes, reading, the, hecyra, together, with, his, son, at, home, terence, was, one, of, the, few, canonical, classical, authors, to, maintain, a, continuous, presence, in, medieval, literacy, and, the, large, number, of, surviving, manuscripts, bears, witness, to, his, great, popularity, adolphus, ward, said, that, terence, led, a, charmed, life, in, the, darkest, ages, of, learning, a, remark, approved, by, e, k, chambers, but, paul, theiner, takes, issue, with, this, suggesting, that, it, is, more, appropriate, to, attribute, a, charmed, life, to, authors, who, survived, the, middle, ages, by, chance, in, a, few, manuscripts, found, in, isolated, libraries, whereas, the, broad, and, constant, popularity, of, terence, rendered, elfin, administrations, quite, unnecessary, roman, students, learning, to, write, would, regularly, be, assigned, to, copy, edifying, sententiae, or, maxims, a, practice, adopted, from, greek, paedagogy, and, terence, was, a, rich, source, of, such, sententiae, scores, of, terentian, maxims, enjoyed, such, currency, in, late, antiquity, that, they, often, lost, nominal, association, with, their, author, with, those, who, quoted, terence, qualifying, his, words, as, a, common, proverb, through, the, middle, ages, terence, was, frequently, quoted, as, an, authority, on, human, nature, and, the, mores, of, men, without, regard, for, which, character, spoke, the, line, or, the, original, dramatic, context, as, long, as, the, quotation, was, sententious, in, itself, when, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, play, augustine, was, a, lifelong, admirer, of, terence, s, observations, on, the, human, condition, and, 38, quotations, from, 28, distinct, passages, of, terence, have, been, identified, in, augustine, s, works, notwithstanding, his, respect, for, terence, s, moralising, when, augustine, writes, in, the, confessions, about, his, school, days, he, quotes, the, scene, from, the, eunuchus, where, chaerea, recounts, how, he, and, pamphila, looked, together, at, a, painting, of, zeus, intruding, in, the, home, of, dana, after, which, chaerea, emboldened, by, the, example, of, the, pagan, god, took, the, opportunity, to, rape, pamphila, augustine, argues, that, it, is, not, necessary, for, students, to, be, exposed, to, such, vileness, turpitudo, merely, to, learn, vocabulary, and, eloquence, in, the, 10th, century, hrotsvit, of, gandersheim, wrote, six, plays, based, on, the, lives, of, christian, saints, on, the, model, of, the, six, comedies, of, terence, in, a, preface, explaining, her, purpose, in, writing, hrotsvit, takes, up, augustine, s, critique, of, the, moral, influence, of, the, comedies, saying, that, many, christians, attracted, by, terence, s, style, find, themselves, corrupted, by, his, subject, matter, and, she, has, undertaken, to, write, works, in, the, same, genre, so, that, the, literary, form, once, used, to, describe, the, shameless, acts, of, licentious, women, might, be, repurposed, to, glorify, the, chastity, of, holy, virgins, as, terence, s, subject, matter, is, trivial, while, hrotsvit, s, is, important, his, plays, are, in, verse, while, hers, are, in, prose, her, plays, are, written, in, the, same, style, as, other, medieval, literature, and, lack, verbal, reminiscences, of, terence, apart, from, some, oaths, and, interjections, and, she, does, not, respect, the, unity, of, time, or, other, ancient, dramatic, conventions, it, has, been, argued, that, terence, s, influence, on, hrotsvit, is, superficial, and, the, only, similarity, between, them, is, that, they, each, wrote, six, plays, hrotsvit, s, indebtedness, to, terence, lies, rather, in, situations, and, subject, matter, transposed, to, invert, the, terentian, plot, and, its, values, the, place, of, the, terentian, hero, who, successfully, pursues, a, woman, is, taken, by, the, girl, who, triumphs, by, resisting, all, advances, or, a, prostitute, who, abandons, her, former, life, and, a, happy, ending, lies, not, in, the, consummation, of, the, young, couple, s, marriage, but, in, a, figurative, marriage, to, christ, whereas, in, the, eunuchus, chaerea, entered, a, courtesan, s, home, disguised, as, a, eunuch, to, gain, access, to, his, beloved, two, of, hrotsvit, s, plays, abraham, and, paphnutius, feature, a, man, entering, a, brothel, disguised, as, a, lover, in, order, to, win, a, woman, to, repentance, and, a, life, of, continence, robert, talbot, reads, hrotsvit, s, plays, as, a, christian, allegorisation, of, terence, designed, to, rehabilitate, the, comedies, themselves, as, hrotsvit, s, reconfiguration, of, the, genre, to, demonstrate, the, superiority, of, heavenly, love, to, earthly, love, will, enable, readers, to, read, terence, in, a, new, way, with, their, minds, directed, from, the, sinful, content, to, a, higher, christian, meaning, hrotsvit, did, not, exercise, a, significant, influence, on, european, literature, before, her, works, were, rediscovered, and, printed, in, 1501, in, the, divine, comedy, dante, s, guide, vergil, tells, him, that, terence, is, in, limbo, among, the, virtuous, pagans, purg, xxii, 94, 105, and, shows, him, thais, the, character, from, the, eunuchus, in, the, eighth, circle, of, hell, where, flatterers, are, punished, inf, xviii, 133, 5, it, has, been, claimed, that, dante, did, not, know, terence, directly, and, his, references, to, terence, are, derived, from, citations, in, cicero, or, medieval, florilegia, however, terence, was, one, of, the, most, commonly, read, authors, in, the, 14th, century, and, joseph, russo, argues, that, considering, the, access, dante, would, have, had, to, manuscripts, of, terence, and, the, desire, he, would, have, had, to, read, terence, the, logical, conclusion, is, that, dante, must, have, known, terence, renaissance, humanists, delighted, in, terence, giovanni, boccaccio, copied, out, in, his, own, hand, all, of, terence, s, comedies, in, a, manuscript, that, is, now, in, the, laurentian, library, the, first, printed, edition, of, terence, appeared, in, strasbourg, in, 1470, while, the, first, certain, post, antique, performance, of, one, of, terence, s, plays, andria, took, place, in, florence, in, 1476, there, is, evidence, however, that, terence, was, performed, much, earlier, the, short, dialogue, terentius, et, delusor, was, probably, written, to, be, performed, as, an, introduction, to, a, terentian, performance, in, the, 9th, century, possibly, earlier, beatus, rhenanus, writes, that, erasmus, gifted, in, his, youth, with, a, tenacious, memory, held, terence, s, comedies, as, closely, as, his, fingers, and, toes, in, the, de, ratione, studii, 1511, a, central, text, for, european, curricula, erasmus, wrote, among, latin, authors, who, is, more, useful, for, learning, to, speak, than, terence, he, is, pure, concise, and, near, to, everyday, conversation, and, pleasant, to, youth, as, well, for, his, genre, of, plot, martin, luther, not, only, quoted, terence, frequently, to, tap, into, his, insights, into, all, things, human, but, also, recommended, his, comedies, for, the, instruction, of, children, in, school, the, preservation, of, terence, through, the, church, enabled, his, work, to, influence, much, of, later, western, drama, two, of, the, earliest, english, comedies, the, 16th, century, ralph, roister, doister, and, gammer, gurton, s, needle, are, thought, to, parody, terence, s, plays, montaigne, and, moli, re, cite, and, imitate, him, based, on, what, is, known, about, a, typical, curriculum, at, a, grammar, school, such, as, william, shakespeare, went, to, it, may, be, considered, certain, that, shakespeare, must, have, studied, terence, as, a, boy, in, shakespeare, s, day, a, typical, schoolboy, at, the, age, of, 9, would, begin, to, memorise, a, great, part, if, not, all, of, terence, a, quote, from, the, eunuchus, in, shakespeare, s, the, taming, of, the, shrew, is, not, taken, direct, from, the, play, but, quoted, in, a, form, in, which, it, is, found, in, william, lily, s, latin, grammar, and, nicholas, udall, s, floures, for, latine, spekynge, with, the, syntax, adapted, to, form, an, independent, sentence, however, the, indebtedness, of, the, character, of, armado, in, love, s, labour, s, lost, to, thraso, in, the, eunuchus, points, to, shakespeare, s, familiarity, with, the, play, as, a, whole, chaerea, s, exultation, upon, coming, out, of, thais, house, after, the, rape, declaring, himself, content, to, die, in, that, blissful, moment, also, seems, to, be, echoed, in, othello, ii, 1, and, the, merry, wives, of, windsor, iii, 3, shakespeare, s, encounter, with, terence, in, grammar, school, introduced, him, to, comedy, and, scenic, structure, laying, the, foundations, for, his, art, terence, s, plays, were, a, standard, part, of, the, latin, curriculum, of, the, neoclassical, period, in, a, letter, prescribing, a, course, of, education, for, his, nephew, peter, carr, thomas, jefferson, listed, terence, among, classical, poets, carr, already, had, read, or, would, read, at, school, jefferson, copied, four, extracts, from, the, andria, into, his, literary, commonplace, book, seemingly, in, the, late, 1760s, and, 1770s, and, the, presence, of, three, different, editions, of, terence, in, the, carefully, selected, second, monticello, library, is, a, clear, indication, that, terence, formed, a, part, of, jefferson, s, retirement, reading, in, 1781, john, adams, offered, his, son, john, quincy, adams, a, copy, of, anne, dacier, s, edition, of, terence, with, a, parallel, french, translation, writing, terence, is, remarkable, for, good, morals, good, taste, and, good, latin, his, language, has, a, simplicity, and, an, elegance, that, makes, him, proper, to, be, accurately, studied, as, a, model, this, was, declined, as, john, quincy, believed, his, teacher, would, not, like, him, to, have, a, translation, because, when, i, shall, translate, him, he, would, desire, that, i, might, do, it, without, help, john, quincy, eventually, read, the, andria, over, three, evenings, in, february, 1786, and, was, not, impressed, with, the, pace, of, his, harvard, class, which, finished, the, play, three, months, later, he, recorded, in, his, diary, that, the, play, is, interesting, and, many, of, the, sentiments, are, fine, and, though, he, found, the, plot, highly, improbable, the, critic, can, never, find, perfection, and, the, person, that, is, willing, to, be, pleased, with, what, he, reads, is, happier, than, he, who, is, always, looking, for, faults, in, 1816, john, quincy, s, son, george, washington, adams, performed, in, a, school, production, of, andria, in, the, role, of, the, old, man, crito, to, the, relief, of, the, family, who, had, worried, he, might, be, given, a, less, respectable, part, george, s, grandmother, abigail, adams, having, read, the, play, took, exception, to, the, manners, and, morals, grandfather, john, after, rereading, all, six, of, terence, s, comedies, also, expressed, apprehension, about, whether, they, were, fit, to, be, taught, or, exhibited, to, impressionable, youths, who, lacked, sufficient, life, experience, to, recognise, certain, characters, and, their, deeds, as, morally, repugnant, and, react, appropriately, accordingly, adams, undertook, a, month, long, project, to, go, through, the, plays, excerpting, approximately, 140, passages, that, he, considered, illustrative, of, human, nature, as, it, is, the, same, in, all, ages, and, countries, adding, translations, and, comments, explaining, the, moral, lessons, his, grandsons, should, draw, from, the, texts, john, quincy, believed, the, manners, and, plots, of, terence, s, plays, were, too, remote, from, modern, life, for, there, to, be, a, danger, of, a, detrimental, influence, on, students, morals, but, praised, his, father, s, project, writing, you, have, indeed, skimmed, the, cream, of, terence, and, sent, it, to, my, boys, i, trust, they, will, preserve, it, and, that, it, will, aid, them, in, drawing, all, the, solid, benefit, from, the, amanuensis, of, laelius, and, scipio, which, he, can, afford, to, their, future, lives, when, adams, sent, his, grandson, charles, francis, adams, his, excerpts, from, the, phormio, he, remarked, in, these, plays, of, terence, are, not, the, slaves, superior, beings, to, the, citizens, every, smart, expression, every, brilliant, image, every, moral, sentiment, is, in, the, mouth, of, a, slave, in, 1834, when, charles, read, the, works, of, terence, copying, in, his, grandfather, s, comments, and, making, other, notes, he, responded, in, returning, to, answer, these, questions, i, must, disagree, with, the, sentiment, i, cannot, overlook, the, characters, of, menedemus, and, chremes, of, micio, and, demea, which, contain, more, moral, sentiment, than, all, the, slaves, in, the, six, plays, american, playwright, thornton, wilder, based, his, novel, the, woman, of, andros, on, terence, s, andria, due, to, his, cognomen, afer, terence, has, long, been, identified, with, africa, and, heralded, as, the, first, poet, of, the, african, diaspora, by, generations, of, writers, including, juan, latino, alexandre, dumas, langston, hughes, and, maya, angelou, phyllis, wheatley, the, first, published, african, american, poet, asked, why, the, muses, had, inspired, one, alone, of, afric, s, sable, race, thomas, jefferson, on, the, other, hand, in, an, attempt, to, prove, that, african, americans, were, naturally, incapable, of, poetry, claimed, that, terence, had, been, of, the, race, of, whites, two, of, his, plays, were, produced, in, denver, with, black, actors, questions, as, to, whether, terence, received, assistance, in, writing, or, was, not, the, actual, author, have, been, debated, over, the, ages, as, described, in, the, 1911, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, meets, the, charge, of, receiving, assistance, in, the, composition, of, his, plays, by, claiming, as, a, great, honour, the, favour, which, he, enjoyed, with, those, who, were, the, favorites, of, the, roman, people, but, the, gossip, not, discouraged, by, terence, lived, and, throve, it, crops, up, in, cicero, and, quintilian, and, the, ascription, of, the, plays, to, scipio, had, the, honour, to, be, accepted, by, montaigne, and, rejected, by, diderot
