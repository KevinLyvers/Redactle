christopher, columbus, k, l, m, b, s, between, 25, august, and, 31, october, 1451, 20, may, 1506, was, an, italian, explorer, and, navigator, from, the, republic, of, genoa, who, completed, four, spanish, based, voyages, across, the, atlantic, ocean, sponsored, by, the, catholic, monarchs, opening, the, way, for, the, widespread, european, exploration, and, colonization, of, the, americas, his, expeditions, were, the, first, known, european, contact, with, the, caribbean, and, central, and, south, america, the, name, christopher, columbus, is, the, anglicisation, of, the, latin, christophorus, columbus, growing, up, on, the, coast, of, liguria, he, went, to, sea, at, a, young, age, and, travelled, widely, as, far, north, as, the, british, isles, and, as, far, south, as, what, is, now, ghana, he, married, portuguese, noblewoman, filipa, moniz, perestrelo, who, bore, a, son, diego, and, was, based, in, lisbon, for, several, years, he, later, took, a, castilian, mistress, beatriz, enr, quez, de, arana, who, bore, a, son, ferdinand, largely, self, educated, columbus, was, knowledgeable, in, geography, astronomy, and, history, he, developed, a, plan, to, seek, a, western, sea, passage, to, the, east, indies, hoping, to, profit, from, the, lucrative, spice, trade, after, the, granada, war, and, columbus, s, persistent, lobbying, in, multiple, kingdoms, the, catholic, monarchs, queen, isabella, i, and, king, ferdinand, ii, agreed, to, sponsor, a, journey, west, columbus, left, castile, in, august, 1492, with, three, ships, and, made, landfall, in, the, americas, on, 12, october, ending, the, period, of, human, habitation, in, the, americas, now, referred, to, as, the, pre, columbian, era, his, landing, place, was, an, island, in, the, bahamas, known, by, its, native, inhabitants, as, guanahani, he, then, visited, the, islands, now, known, as, cuba, and, hispaniola, establishing, a, colony, in, what, is, now, haiti, columbus, returned, to, castile, in, early, 1493, with, captured, natives, word, of, his, voyage, soon, spread, throughout, europe, columbus, made, three, further, voyages, to, the, americas, exploring, the, lesser, antilles, in, 1493, trinidad, and, the, northern, coast, of, south, america, in, 1498, and, the, east, coast, of, central, america, in, 1502, many, names, he, gave, to, geographical, features, particularly, islands, are, still, in, use, he, gave, the, name, indios, indians, to, the, indigenous, peoples, he, encountered, the, extent, to, which, he, was, aware, the, americas, were, a, wholly, separate, landmass, is, uncertain, he, never, clearly, renounced, his, belief, he, had, reached, the, far, east, as, a, colonial, governor, columbus, was, accused, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, of, significant, brutality, and, removed, from, the, post, columbus, s, strained, relationship, with, the, crown, of, castile, and, its, colonial, administrators, in, america, led, to, his, arrest, and, removal, from, hispaniola, in, 1500, and, later, to, protracted, litigation, over, the, privileges, he, and, his, heirs, claimed, were, owed, to, them, by, the, crown, columbus, s, expeditions, inaugurated, a, period, of, exploration, conquest, and, colonization, that, lasted, for, centuries, thus, bringing, the, americas, into, the, european, sphere, of, influence, the, transfer, of, plants, animals, precious, metals, culture, human, populations, technology, diseases, and, ideas, between, the, old, world, and, new, world, that, followed, his, first, voyage, are, known, as, the, columbian, exchange, these, events, and, the, effects, which, persist, to, the, present, are, often, cited, as, the, beginning, of, the, modern, era, columbus, was, widely, celebrated, in, the, centuries, after, his, death, but, public, perception, fractured, in, the, 21st, century, due, to, greater, attention, to, the, harms, committed, under, his, governance, particularly, the, beginning, of, the, depopulation, of, hispaniola, s, indigenous, ta, no, people, caused, by, old, world, diseases, and, mistreatment, including, slavery, many, places, in, the, western, hemisphere, bear, his, name, including, the, south, american, country, of, colombia, the, canadian, province, of, british, columbia, the, american, city, columbus, ohio, and, the, u, s, capital, the, district, of, columbia, columbus, s, early, life, is, obscure, but, scholars, believe, he, was, born, in, the, republic, of, genoa, between, 25, august, and, 31, october, 1451, his, father, was, domenico, colombo, a, wool, weaver, who, worked, in, genoa, and, savona, and, owned, a, cheese, stand, at, which, young, christopher, worked, his, mother, was, susanna, fontanarossa, he, had, three, brothers, bartholomew, giovanni, pellegrino, and, giacomo, also, called, diego, as, well, as, a, sister, bianchinetta, bartholomew, ran, a, cartography, workshop, in, lisbon, for, at, least, part, of, his, adulthood, his, native, language, is, presumed, to, have, been, a, genoese, dialect, ligurian, as, his, first, language, though, columbus, probably, never, wrote, in, it, his, name, in, 15th, century, genoese, was, cristoffa, corombo, in, italian, cristoforo, colombo, and, in, spanish, crist, bal, col, n, in, one, of, his, writings, he, says, he, went, to, sea, at, 14, in, 1470, the, family, moved, to, savona, where, domenico, took, over, a, tavern, some, modern, authors, have, argued, that, he, was, not, from, genoa, but, from, the, aragon, region, of, spain, or, from, portugal, these, competing, hypotheses, have, been, discounted, by, most, scholars, in, 1473, columbus, began, his, apprenticeship, as, business, agent, for, the, wealthy, spinola, centurione, and, di, negro, families, of, genoa, later, he, made, a, trip, to, the, greek, island, chios, in, the, aegean, sea, then, ruled, by, genoa, in, may, 1476, he, took, part, in, an, armed, convoy, sent, by, genoa, to, carry, valuable, cargo, to, northern, europe, he, probably, visited, bristol, england, and, galway, ireland, where, he, may, have, visited, st, nicholas, collegiate, church, it, has, been, speculated, he, went, to, iceland, in, 1477, though, many, scholars, doubt, this, it, is, known, that, in, the, autumn, of, 1477, he, sailed, on, a, portuguese, ship, from, galway, to, lisbon, where, he, found, his, brother, bartholomew, and, they, continued, trading, for, the, centurione, family, columbus, based, himself, in, lisbon, from, 1477, to, 1485, in, 1478, the, centuriones, sent, columbus, on, a, sugar, buying, trip, to, madeira, he, married, felipa, perestrello, e, moniz, daughter, of, bartolomeu, perestrello, a, portuguese, nobleman, of, lombard, origin, who, had, been, the, donatary, captain, of, porto, santo, in, 1479, or, 1480, columbus, s, son, diego, was, born, between, 1482, and, 1485, columbus, traded, along, the, coasts, of, west, africa, reaching, the, portuguese, trading, post, of, elmina, at, the, guinea, coast, in, present, day, ghana, before, 1484, columbus, returned, to, porto, santo, to, find, that, his, wife, had, died, he, returned, to, portugal, to, settle, her, estate, and, take, diego, with, him, he, left, portugal, for, castile, in, 1485, where, he, took, a, mistress, in, 1487, a, 20, year, old, orphan, named, beatriz, enr, quez, de, arana, it, is, likely, that, beatriz, met, columbus, when, he, was, in, c, rdoba, a, gathering, place, for, genoese, merchants, and, where, the, court, of, the, catholic, monarchs, was, located, at, intervals, beatriz, unmarried, at, the, time, gave, birth, to, columbus, s, second, son, fernando, columbus, in, july, 1488, named, for, the, monarch, of, aragon, columbus, recognized, the, boy, as, his, offspring, columbus, entrusted, his, older, legitimate, son, diego, to, take, care, of, beatriz, and, pay, the, pension, set, aside, for, her, following, his, death, but, diego, was, negligent, in, his, duties, columbus, learned, latin, portuguese, and, castilian, he, read, widely, about, astronomy, geography, and, history, including, the, works, of, ptolemy, pierre, d, ailly, s, imago, mundi, the, travels, of, marco, polo, and, sir, john, mandeville, pliny, s, natural, history, and, pope, pius, ii, s, historia, rerum, ubique, gestarum, according, to, historian, edmund, morgan, columbus, was, not, a, scholarly, man, yet, he, studied, these, books, made, hundreds, of, marginal, notations, in, them, and, came, out, with, ideas, about, the, world, that, were, characteristically, simple, and, strong, and, sometimes, wrong, under, the, mongol, empire, s, hegemony, over, asia, and, the, pax, mongolica, europeans, had, long, enjoyed, a, safe, land, passage, on, the, silk, road, to, india, parts, of, east, asia, including, china, and, maritime, southeast, asia, which, were, sources, of, valuable, goods, with, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1453, the, silk, road, was, closed, to, christian, traders, in, 1474, the, florentine, astronomer, paolo, dal, pozzo, toscanelli, suggested, to, king, afonso, v, of, portugal, that, sailing, west, across, the, atlantic, would, be, a, quicker, way, to, reach, the, maluku, spice, islands, china, japan, and, india, than, the, route, around, africa, but, afonso, rejected, his, proposal, in, the, 1480s, columbus, and, his, brother, proposed, a, plan, to, reach, the, east, indies, by, sailing, west, columbus, supposedly, wrote, to, toscanelli, in, 1481, and, received, encouragement, along, with, a, copy, of, a, map, the, astronomer, had, sent, afonso, implying, that, a, westward, route, to, asia, was, possible, columbus, s, plans, were, complicated, by, bartolomeu, dias, s, rounding, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1488, which, suggested, the, cape, route, around, africa, to, asia, columbus, had, to, wait, until, 1492, for, king, ferdinand, and, queen, isabella, of, spain, to, support, his, voyage, across, the, atlantic, to, find, gold, spices, a, safer, route, to, the, east, and, converts, to, christianity, carol, delaney, and, other, commentators, have, argued, that, columbus, was, a, christian, millennialist, and, apocalypticist, and, that, these, beliefs, motivated, his, quest, for, asia, in, a, variety, of, ways, columbus, often, wrote, about, seeking, gold, in, the, log, books, of, his, voyages, and, writes, about, acquiring, it, in, such, quantity, that, the, sovereigns, will, undertake, and, prepare, to, go, conquer, the, holy, sepulcher, in, a, fulfillment, of, biblical, prophecy, columbus, often, wrote, about, converting, all, races, to, christianity, abbas, hamandi, argues, that, columbus, was, motivated, by, the, hope, of, jerusalem, from, muslim, hands, by, using, the, resources, of, newly, discovered, lands, despite, a, popular, misconception, to, the, contrary, nearly, all, educated, westerners, of, columbus, s, time, knew, that, the, earth, is, spherical, a, concept, that, had, been, understood, since, antiquity, the, techniques, of, celestial, navigation, which, uses, the, position, of, the, sun, and, the, stars, in, the, sky, had, long, been, in, use, by, astronomers, and, were, beginning, to, be, implemented, by, mariners, however, columbus, made, several, errors, in, calculating, the, size, of, the, earth, the, distance, the, continent, extended, to, the, east, and, therefore, the, distance, to, the, west, to, reach, his, goal, first, as, far, back, as, the, 3rd, century, bc, eratosthenes, had, correctly, computed, the, circumference, of, the, earth, by, using, simple, geometry, and, studying, the, shadows, cast, by, objects, at, two, remote, locations, in, the, 1st, century, bc, posidonius, confirmed, eratosthenes, s, results, by, comparing, stellar, observations, at, two, separate, locations, these, measurements, were, widely, known, among, scholars, but, ptolemy, s, use, of, the, smaller, old, fashioned, units, of, distance, led, columbus, to, underestimate, the, size, of, the, earth, by, about, a, third, second, three, cosmographical, parameters, determined, the, bounds, of, columbus, s, enterprise, the, distance, across, the, ocean, between, europe, and, asia, which, depended, on, the, extent, of, the, oikumene, i, e, the, eurasian, land, mass, stretching, east, west, between, spain, and, china, the, circumference, of, the, earth, and, the, number, of, miles, or, leagues, in, a, degree, of, longitude, which, was, possible, to, deduce, from, the, theory, of, the, relationship, between, the, size, of, the, surfaces, of, water, and, the, land, as, held, by, the, followers, of, aristotle, in, medieval, times, from, pierre, d, ailly, s, imago, mundi, 1410, columbus, learned, of, alfraganus, s, estimate, that, a, degree, of, latitude, equal, to, approximately, a, degree, of, longitude, along, the, equator, spanned, 56, 67, arabic, miles, equivalent, to, 66, 2, nautical, miles, 122, 6, kilometers, or, 76, 2, mi, but, he, did, not, realize, that, this, was, expressed, in, the, arabic, mile, about, 1, 830, meters, or, 1, 14, mi, rather, than, the, shorter, roman, mile, about, 1, 480, m, with, which, he, was, familiar, columbus, therefore, estimated, the, size, of, the, earth, to, be, about, 75, of, eratosthenes, s, calculation, third, most, scholars, of, the, time, accepted, ptolemy, s, estimate, that, eurasia, spanned, 180, longitude, rather, than, the, actual, 130, to, the, chinese, mainland, or, 150, to, japan, at, the, latitude, of, spain, columbus, believed, an, even, higher, estimate, leaving, a, smaller, percentage, for, water, in, d, ailly, s, imago, mundi, columbus, read, marinus, of, tyre, s, estimate, that, the, longitudinal, span, of, eurasia, was, 225, at, the, latitude, of, rhodes, some, historians, such, as, samuel, eliot, morison, have, suggested, that, he, followed, the, statement, in, the, apocryphal, book, 2, esdras, 6, 42, that, six, parts, are, habitable, and, the, seventh, is, covered, with, water, he, was, also, aware, of, marco, polo, s, claim, that, japan, which, he, called, cipangu, was, some, 2, 414, km, 1, 500, mi, to, the, east, of, china, cathay, and, closer, to, the, equator, than, it, is, he, was, influenced, by, toscanelli, s, idea, that, there, were, inhabited, islands, even, farther, to, the, east, than, japan, including, the, mythical, antillia, which, he, thought, might, lie, not, much, farther, to, the, west, than, the, azores, and, the, distance, westward, from, the, canary, islands, to, the, indies, as, only, 68, degrees, equivalent, to, 3, 080, nmi, 5, 700, km, 3, 540, mi, a, 58, error, based, on, his, sources, columbus, estimated, a, distance, of, 2, 400, nmi, 4, 400, km, 2, 800, mi, from, the, canary, islands, west, to, japan, the, actual, distance, is, 10, 600, nmi, 19, 600, km, 12, 200, mi, no, ship, in, the, 15th, century, could, have, carried, enough, food, and, fresh, water, for, such, a, long, voyage, and, the, dangers, involved, in, navigating, through, the, uncharted, ocean, would, have, been, formidable, most, european, navigators, reasonably, concluded, that, a, westward, voyage, from, europe, to, asia, was, unfeasible, the, catholic, monarchs, however, having, completed, the, reconquista, an, expensive, war, against, the, moors, in, the, iberian, peninsula, were, eager, to, obtain, a, competitive, edge, over, other, european, countries, in, the, quest, for, trade, with, the, indies, columbus, s, project, though, far, fetched, held, the, promise, of, such, an, advantage, though, columbus, was, wrong, about, the, number, of, degrees, of, longitude, that, separated, europe, from, the, far, east, and, about, the, distance, that, each, degree, represented, he, did, take, advantage, of, the, trade, winds, which, would, prove, to, be, the, key, to, his, successful, navigation, of, the, atlantic, ocean, he, planned, to, first, sail, to, the, canary, islands, before, continuing, west, with, the, northeast, trade, wind, part, of, the, return, to, spain, would, require, traveling, against, the, wind, using, an, arduous, sailing, technique, called, beating, during, which, progress, is, made, very, slowly, to, effectively, make, the, return, voyage, columbus, would, need, to, follow, the, curving, trade, winds, northeastward, to, the, middle, latitudes, of, the, north, atlantic, where, he, would, be, able, to, catch, the, westerlies, that, blow, eastward, to, the, coast, of, western, europe, the, navigational, technique, for, travel, in, the, atlantic, appears, to, have, been, exploited, first, by, the, portuguese, who, referred, to, it, as, the, volta, do, mar, turn, of, the, sea, through, his, marriage, to, his, first, wife, felipa, perestrello, columbus, had, access, to, the, nautical, charts, and, logs, that, had, belonged, to, her, deceased, father, bartolomeu, perestrello, who, had, served, as, a, captain, in, the, portuguese, navy, under, prince, henry, the, navigator, in, the, mapmaking, shop, where, he, worked, with, his, brother, bartholomew, columbus, also, had, ample, opportunity, to, hear, the, stories, of, old, seamen, about, their, voyages, to, the, western, seas, but, his, knowledge, of, the, atlantic, wind, patterns, was, still, imperfect, at, the, time, of, his, first, voyage, by, sailing, due, west, from, the, canary, islands, during, hurricane, season, skirting, the, so, called, horse, latitudes, of, the, mid, atlantic, he, risked, being, becalmed, and, running, into, a, tropical, cyclone, both, of, which, he, avoided, by, chance, by, about, 1484, columbus, proposed, his, planned, voyage, to, king, john, ii, of, portugal, the, king, submitted, columbus, s, proposal, to, his, advisors, who, rejected, it, correctly, on, the, grounds, that, columbus, s, estimate, for, a, voyage, of, 2, 400, nmi, was, only, a, quarter, of, what, it, should, have, been, in, 1488, columbus, again, appealed, to, the, court, of, portugal, and, john, ii, again, granted, him, an, audience, that, meeting, also, proved, unsuccessful, in, part, because, not, long, afterwards, bartolomeu, dias, returned, to, portugal, with, news, of, his, successful, rounding, of, the, southern, tip, of, africa, near, the, cape, of, good, hope, columbus, sought, an, audience, with, the, monarchs, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castile, who, had, united, several, kingdoms, in, the, iberian, peninsula, by, marrying, and, now, ruled, together, on, 1, may, 1486, permission, having, been, granted, columbus, presented, his, plans, to, queen, isabella, who, in, turn, referred, it, to, a, committee, the, learned, men, of, spain, like, their, counterparts, in, portugal, replied, that, columbus, had, grossly, underestimated, the, distance, to, asia, they, pronounced, the, idea, impractical, and, advised, the, catholic, monarchs, to, pass, on, the, proposed, venture, to, keep, columbus, from, taking, his, ideas, elsewhere, and, perhaps, to, keep, their, options, open, the, sovereigns, gave, him, an, allowance, totaling, about, 14, 000, maravedis, for, the, year, or, about, the, annual, salary, of, a, sailor, in, may, 1489, the, queen, sent, him, another, 10, 000, maravedis, and, the, same, year, the, monarchs, furnished, him, with, a, letter, ordering, all, cities, and, towns, under, their, dominion, to, provide, him, food, and, lodging, at, no, cost, columbus, also, dispatched, his, brother, bartholomew, to, the, court, of, henry, vii, of, england, to, inquire, whether, the, english, crown, might, sponsor, his, expedition, but, he, was, captured, by, pirates, en, route, and, only, arrived, in, early, 1491, by, that, time, columbus, had, retreated, to, la, r, bida, friary, where, the, spanish, crown, sent, him, 20, 000, maravedis, to, buy, new, clothes, and, instructions, to, return, to, the, spanish, court, for, renewed, discussions, columbus, waited, at, king, ferdinand, s, camp, until, ferdinand, and, isabella, conquered, granada, the, last, muslim, stronghold, on, the, iberian, peninsula, in, january, 1492, a, council, led, by, isabella, s, confessor, hernando, de, talavera, found, columbus, s, proposal, to, reach, the, indies, implausible, columbus, had, left, for, france, when, ferdinand, intervened, first, sending, talavera, and, bishop, diego, deza, to, appeal, to, the, queen, isabella, was, finally, convinced, by, the, king, s, clerk, luis, de, sant, ngel, who, argued, that, columbus, would, take, his, ideas, elsewhere, and, offered, to, help, arrange, the, funding, isabella, then, sent, a, royal, guard, to, fetch, columbus, who, had, traveled, 2, leagues, over, 10, km, toward, c, rdoba, in, the, april, 1492, capitulations, of, santa, fe, king, ferdinand, and, queen, isabella, promised, columbus, that, if, he, succeeded, he, would, be, given, the, rank, of, admiral, of, the, ocean, sea, and, appointed, viceroy, and, governor, of, all, the, new, lands, he, might, claim, for, spain, he, had, the, right, to, nominate, three, persons, from, whom, the, sovereigns, would, choose, one, for, any, office, in, the, new, lands, he, would, be, entitled, to, 10, diezmo, of, all, the, revenues, from, the, new, lands, in, perpetuity, he, also, would, have, the, option, of, buying, one, eighth, interest, in, any, commercial, venture, in, the, new, lands, and, receive, one, eighth, ochavo, of, the, profits, in, 1500, during, his, third, voyage, to, the, americas, columbus, was, arrested, and, dismissed, from, his, posts, he, and, his, sons, diego, and, fernando, then, conducted, a, lengthy, series, of, court, cases, against, the, castilian, crown, known, as, the, pleitos, colombinos, alleging, that, the, crown, had, illegally, reneged, on, its, contractual, obligations, to, columbus, and, his, heirs, the, columbus, family, had, some, success, in, their, first, litigation, as, a, judgment, of, 1511, confirmed, diego, s, position, as, viceroy, but, reduced, his, powers, diego, resumed, litigation, in, 1512, which, lasted, until, 1536, and, further, disputes, initiated, by, heirs, continued, until, 1790, between, 1492, and, 1504, columbus, completed, four, round, trip, voyages, between, spain, and, the, americas, each, voyage, being, sponsored, by, the, crown, of, castile, on, his, first, voyage, he, reached, the, americas, initiating, the, european, exploration, and, colonization, of, the, continent, as, well, as, the, columbian, exchange, his, role, in, history, is, thus, important, to, the, age, of, discovery, western, history, and, human, history, writ, large, in, columbus, s, letter, on, the, first, voyage, published, following, his, first, return, to, spain, he, claimed, that, he, had, reached, asia, as, previously, described, by, marco, polo, and, other, europeans, over, his, subsequent, voyages, columbus, refused, to, acknowledge, that, the, lands, he, visited, and, claimed, for, spain, were, not, part, of, asia, in, the, face, of, mounting, evidence, to, the, contrary, this, might, explain, in, part, why, the, american, continent, was, named, after, the, florentine, explorer, amerigo, vespucci, who, received, credit, for, recognizing, it, as, a, new, world, and, not, after, columbus, on, the, evening, of, 3, august, 1492, columbus, departed, from, palos, de, la, frontera, with, three, ships, the, largest, was, a, carrack, the, santa, mar, a, owned, and, captained, by, juan, de, la, cosa, and, under, columbus, s, direct, command, the, other, two, were, smaller, caravels, the, pinta, and, the, ni, a, piloted, by, the, pinz, n, brothers, columbus, first, sailed, to, the, canary, islands, there, he, restocked, provisions, and, made, repairs, then, departed, from, san, sebasti, n, de, la, gomera, on, 6, september, for, what, turned, out, to, be, a, five, week, voyage, across, the, ocean, on, 7, october, the, crew, spotted, mmense, flocks, of, birds, on, 11, october, columbus, changed, the, fleet, s, course, to, due, west, and, sailed, through, the, night, believing, land, was, soon, to, be,

what, they, were, and, they, showed, me, how, people, from, other, islands, nearby, came, there, and, tried, to, take, them, and, how, they, defended, themselves, and, i, believed, and, believe, that, they, come, here, from, tierra, firme, to, take, them, captive, they, should, be, good, and, intelligent, servants, for, i, see, that, they, say, very, quickly, everything, that, is, said, to, them, and, i, believe, they, would, become, christians, very, easily, for, it, seemed, to, me, that, they, had, no, religion, our, lord, pleasing, at, the, time, of, my, departure, i, will, take, six, of,

he, learned, from, guacanagar, x, the, local, tribe, leader, that, his, men, had, quarreled, over, gold, and, taken, women, from, the, tribe, and, that, after, some, left, for, the, territory, of, caonabo, caonabo, came, and, burned, the, fort, and, killed, the, rest, of, the, men, there, columbus, then, established, a, poorly, located, and, short, lived, settlement, to, the, east, la, isabela, in, the, present, day, dominican, republic, by, the, end, of, 1494, disease, and, famine, had, killed, two, thirds, of, the, spanish, settlers, there, from, april, to, august, 1494, columbus, explored, cuba, and, jamaica, then, returned, to, hispaniola, before, leaving, on, this, exploration, to, cuba, columbus, had, ordered, a, large, amount, of, men, under, pedro, margarit, to, journey, the, length, and, breadth, of, the, island, enforcing, spanish, control, and, bringing, all, the, people, under, the, spanish, yoke, these, men, in, his, absence, raped, women, took, men, captive, to, be, servants, and, stole, from, the, indigenous, people, a, number, of, spanish, were, killed, in, retaliation, by, the, time, columbus, returned, from, exploring, cuba, the, four, primary, leaders, of, the, arawak, people, in, hispaniola, were, gathering, for, war, to, try, to, drive, the, spanish, from, the, island, columbus, assembled, a, large, number, of, troops, and, joined, with, his, one, native, ally, chief, met, for, battle, the, spanish, even, though, they, were, largely, outnumbered, won, this, battle, and, over, the, next, 9, months, columbus, continued, to, wage, war, on, the, native, taino, on, hispaniola, until, they, surrendered, and, agreed, to, pay, tribute, columbus, implemented, encomienda, a, spanish, labor, system, that, rewarded, conquerors, with, the, labor, of, conquered, non, christian, people, it, is, also, recorded, that, punishments, to, both, spaniards, and, natives, included, whippings, and, mutilation, cutting, noses, and, ears, columbus, and, the, colonists, enslaved, many, of, the, indigenous, people, including, children, natives, were, beaten, raped, and, tortured, for, the, location, of, imagined, gold, thousands, committed, suicide, rather, than, face, the, oppression, in, february, 1495, columbus, rounded, up, about, 1, 500, arawaks, some, of, whom, had, rebelled, in, a, great, slave, raid, about, 500, of, the, strongest, were, shipped, to, spain, as, slaves, with, about, two, hundred, of, those, dying, en, route, in, june, 1495, the, spanish, crown, sent, ships, and, supplies, to, hispaniola, in, october, florentine, merchant, gianotto, berardi, who, had, won, the, contract, to, provision, the, fleet, of, columbus, s, second, voyage, and, to, supply, the, colony, on, hispaniola, received, almost, 40, 000, maraved, s, worth, of, enslaved, indians, he, renewed, his, effort, to, get, supplies, to, columbus, and, was, working, to, organize, a, fleet, when, he, suddenly, died, in, december, on, 10, march, 1496, having, been, away, about, 30, months, the, fleet, departed, la, isabela, on, 8, june, the, crew, sighted, land, somewhere, between, lisbon, and, cape, st, vincent, and, disembarked, in, c, diz, on, 11, june, on, 30, may, 1498, columbus, left, with, six, ships, from, sanl, car, spain, the, fleet, called, at, madeira, and, the, canary, islands, where, it, divided, in, two, with, three, ships, heading, for, hispaniola, and, the, other, three, vessels, commanded, by, columbus, sailing, south, to, the, cape, verde, islands, and, then, westward, across, the, atlantic, it, is, probable, that, this, expedition, was, intended, at, least, partly, to, confirm, rumors, of, a, large, continent, south, of, the, caribbean, sea, that, is, south, america, on, 31, july, they, sighted, trinidad, the, most, southerly, of, the, caribbean, islands, on, 5, august, columbus, sent, several, small, boats, ashore, on, the, southern, side, of, the, paria, peninsula, in, what, is, now, venezuela, near, the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, river, this, was, the, first, recorded, landing, of, europeans, on, the, mainland, of, south, america, which, columbus, realized, must, be, a, continent, the, fleet, then, sailed, to, the, islands, of, chacachacare, and, margarita, reaching, the, latter, on, 14, august, and, sighted, tobago, and, grenada, from, afar, according, to, some, scholars, on, 19, august, columbus, returned, to, hispaniola, there, he, found, settlers, in, rebellion, against, his, rule, and, his, unfulfilled, promises, of, riches, columbus, had, some, of, the, europeans, tried, for, their, disobedience, at, least, one, rebel, leader, was, hanged, in, october, 1499, columbus, sent, two, ships, to, spain, asking, the, court, of, spain, to, appoint, a, royal, commissioner, to, help, him, govern, by, this, time, accusations, of, tyranny, and, incompetence, on, the, part, of, columbus, had, also, reached, the, court, the, sovereigns, sent, francisco, de, bobadilla, a, relative, of, marquesa, beatriz, de, bobadilla, a, patron, of, columbus, and, a, close, friend, of, queen, isabella, to, investigate, the, accusations, of, brutality, made, against, the, admiral, arriving, in, santo, domingo, while, columbus, was, away, bobadilla, was, immediately, met, with, complaints, about, all, three, columbus, brothers, he, moved, into, columbus, s, house, and, seized, his, property, took, depositions, from, the, admiral, s, enemies, and, declared, himself, governor, bobadilla, reported, to, spain, that, columbus, once, punished, a, man, found, guilty, of, stealing, corn, by, having, his, ears, and, nose, cut, off, and, then, selling, him, into, slavery, he, claimed, that, columbus, regularly, used, torture, and, mutilation, to, govern, hispaniola, testimony, recorded, in, the, report, stated, that, columbus, congratulated, his, brother, bartholomew, on, defending, the, family, when, the, latter, ordered, for, a, woman, to, be, paraded, naked, through, the, streets, and, then, had, her, tongue, cut, because, she, had, spoken, ill, of, the, admiral, and, his, brothers, the, document, also, describes, how, columbus, put, down, native, unrest, and, revolt, he, first, ordered, a, brutal, suppression, of, the, uprising, in, which, many, natives, were, killed, and, then, paraded, their, dismembered, bodies, through, the, streets, in, an, attempt, to, discourage, further, rebellion, columbus, vehemently, denied, the, charges, the, neutrality, and, accuracy, of, the, accusations, and, investigations, of, bobadilla, toward, columbus, and, his, brothers, have, been, disputed, by, historians, given, the, anti, italian, sentiment, of, the, spaniards, and, bobadilla, s, desire, to, take, over, columbus, s, position, in, early, october, 1500, columbus, and, diego, presented, themselves, to, bobadilla, and, were, put, in, chains, aboard, la, gorda, the, caravel, on, which, bobadilla, had, arrived, at, santo, domingo, they, were, returned, to, spain, and, languished, in, jail, for, six, weeks, before, king, ferdinand, ordered, their, release, not, long, after, the, king, and, queen, summoned, the, columbus, brothers, to, the, alhambra, palace, in, granada, the, sovereigns, expressed, indignation, at, the, actions, of, bobadilla, who, was, then, recalled, and, ordered, to, make, restitutions, of, the, property, he, had, confiscated, from, columbus, the, royal, couple, heard, the, brothers, pleas, restored, their, freedom, and, wealth, and, after, much, persuasion, agreed, to, fund, columbus, s, fourth, voyage, however, nicol, s, de, ovando, was, to, replace, bobadilla, and, be, the, new, governor, of, the, west, indies, new, light, was, shed, on, the, seizure, of, columbus, and, his, brother, bartholomew, the, adelantado, with, the, discovery, by, archivist, isabel, aguirre, of, an, incomplete, copy, of, the, testimonies, against, them, gathered, by, francisco, de, bobadilla, at, santo, domingo, in, 1500, she, found, a, manuscript, copy, of, this, pesquisa, inquiry, in, the, archive, of, simancas, spain, uncatalogued, until, she, and, consuelo, varela, published, their, book, la, ca, da, de, crist, bal, col, n,

portuguese, soldiers, said, to, be, besieged, by, the, moors, the, siege, had, been, lifted, by, the, time, they, arrived, so, the, spaniards, stayed, only, a, day, and, continued, on, to, the, canary, islands, on, 15, june, the, fleet, arrived, at, martinique, where, it, lingered, for, several, days, a, hurricane, was, forming, so, columbus, continued, westward, hoping, to, find, shelter, on, hispaniola, he, arrived, at, santo, domingo, on, 29, june, but, was, denied, port, and, the, new, governor, francisco, de, bobadilla, refused, to, listen, to, his, warning, that, a, hurricane, was, approaching, instead, while, columbus, s, ships, sheltered, at, the, mouth, of, the, rio, jaina, the, first, spanish, treasure, fleet, sailed, into, the, hurricane, columbus, s, ships, survived, with, only, minor, damage, while, 20, of, the, 30, ships, in, the, governor, s, fleet, were, lost, along, with, 500, lives, including, that, of, francisco, de, bobadilla, although, a, few, surviving, ships, managed, to, straggle, back, to, santo, domingo, aguja, the, fragile, ship, carrying, columbus, s, personal, belongings, and, his, 4, 000, pesos, in, gold, was, the, sole, vessel, to, reach, spain, the, gold, was, his, tenth, d, cimo, of, the, profits, from, hispaniola, equal, to, 240, 000, maravedis, guaranteed, by, the, catholic, monarchs, in, 1492, after, a, brief, stop, at, jamaica, columbus, sailed, to, central, america, arriving, at, the, coast, of, honduras, on, 30, july, here, bartholomew, found, native, merchants, and, a, large, canoe, on, 14, august, columbus, landed, on, the, continental, mainland, at, punta, caxinas, now, puerto, castilla, honduras, he, spent, two, months, exploring, the, coasts, of, honduras, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, seeking, a, strait, in, the, western, caribbean, through, which, he, could, sail, to, the, indian, ocean, sailing, south, along, the, nicaraguan, coast, he, found, a, channel, that, led, into, almirante, bay, in, panama, on, 5, october, as, soon, as, his, ships, anchored, in, almirante, bay, columbus, encountered, ng, be, people, in, canoes, who, were, wearing, gold, ornaments, in, january, 1503, he, established, a, garrison, at, the, mouth, of, the, bel, n, river, columbus, left, for, hispaniola, on, 16, april, on, 10, may, he, sighted, the, cayman, islands, naming, them, las, tortugas, after, the, numerous, sea, turtles, there, his, ships, sustained, damage, in, a, storm, off, the, coast, of, cuba, unable, to, travel, farther, on, 25, june, 1503, they, were, beached, in, saint, ann, parish, jamaica, for, six, months, columbus, and, 230, of, his, men, remained, stranded, on, jamaica, diego, m, ndez, de, segura, who, had, shipped, out, as, a, personal, secretary, to, columbus, and, a, spanish, shipmate, called, bartolom, flisco, along, with, six, natives, paddled, a, canoe, to, get, help, from, hispaniola, the, governor, nicol, s, de, ovando, y, c, ceres, detested, columbus, and, obstructed, all, efforts, to, rescue, him, and, his, men, in, the, meantime, columbus, in, a, desperate, effort, to, induce, the, natives, to, continue, provisioning, him, and, his, hungry, men, won, their, favor, by, predicting, a, lunar, eclipse, for, 29, february, 1504, using, abraham, zacuto, s, astronomical, charts, despite, the, governor, s, obstruction, christopher, columbus, and, his, men, were, rescued, on, 28, june, 1504, and, arrived, in, sanl, car, spain, on, 7, november, columbus, had, always, claimed, that, the, conversion, of, non, believers, was, one, reason, for, his, explorations, and, he, grew, increasingly, religious, in, his, later, years, probably, with, the, assistance, of, his, son, diego, and, his, friend, the, carthusian, monk, gaspar, gorricio, columbus, produced, two, books, during, his, later, years, a, book, of, privileges, 1502, detailing, and, documenting, the, rewards, from, the, spanish, crown, to, which, he, believed, he, and, his, heirs, were, entitled, and, a, book, of, prophecies, 1505, in, which, passages, from, the, bible, were, used, to, place, his, achievements, as, an, explorer, in, the, context, of, christian, eschatology, in, his, later, years, columbus, demanded, that, the, crown, of, castile, give, him, his, tenth, of, all, the, riches, and, trade, goods, yielded, by, the, new, lands, as, stipulated, in, the, capitulations, of, santa, fe, because, he, had, been, relieved, of, his, duties, as, governor, the, crown, did, not, feel, bound, by, that, contract, and, his, demands, were, rejected, after, his, death, his, heirs, sued, the, crown, for, a, part, of, the, profits, from, trade, with, america, as, well, as, other, rewards, this, led, to, a, protracted, series, of, legal, disputes, known, as, the, pleitos, colombinos, columbian, lawsuits, during, a, violent, storm, on, his, first, return, voyage, columbus, then, 41, had, suffered, an, attack, of, what, was, believed, at, the, time, to, be, gout, in, subsequent, years, he, was, plagued, with, what, was, thought, to, be, influenza, and, other, fevers, bleeding, from, the, eyes, temporary, blindness, and, prolonged, attacks, of, gout, the, attacks, increased, in, duration, and, severity, sometimes, leaving, columbus, bedridden, for, months, at, a, time, and, culminated, in, his, death, 14, years, later, based, on, columbus, s, lifestyle, and, the, described, symptoms, some, modern, commentators, suspect, that, he, suffered, from, reactive, arthritis, rather, than, gout, reactive, arthritis, is, a, joint, inflammation, caused, by, intestinal, bacterial, infections, or, after, acquiring, certain, sexually, transmitted, diseases, primarily, chlamydia, or, gonorrhea, in, 2006, frank, c, arnett, a, medical, doctor, and, historian, charles, merrill, published, their, paper, in, the, american, journal, of, the, medical, sciences, proposing, that, columbus, had, a, form, of, reactive, arthritis, merrill, made, the, case, in, that, same, paper, that, columbus, was, the, son, of, catalans, and, his, mother, possibly, a, member, of, a, prominent, converso, converted, jew, family, it, seems, likely, that, acquired, reactive, arthritis, from, food, poisoning, on, one, of, his, ocean, voyages, because, of, poor, sanitation, and, improper, food, preparation, says, arnett, a, rheumatologist, and, professor, of, internal, medicine, pathology, and, laboratory, medicine, at, the, university, of, texas, medical, school, at, houston, some, historians, such, as, h, micheal, tarver, and, emily, slape, as, well, as, medical, doctors, such, as, arnett, and, antonio, rodr, guez, cuartero, believe, that, columbus, had, such, a, form, of, reactive, arthritis, but, according, to, other, authorities, this, is, speculative, or, very, speculative, after, his, arrival, to, sanl, car, from, his, fourth, voyage, and, queen, isabella, s, death, an, ill, columbus, settled, in, seville, in, april, 1505, he, stubbornly, continued, to, make, pleas, to, the, crown, to, defend, his, own, personal, privileges, and, his, family, s, he, moved, to, segovia, where, the, court, was, at, the, time, on, a, mule, by, early, 1506, and, on, the, occasion, of, the, wedding, of, king, ferdinand, with, germaine, of, foix, in, valladolid, spain, in, march, 1506, columbus, moved, to, that, city, to, persist, with, his, demands, on, 20, may, 1506, aged, 54, columbus, died, in, valladolid, columbus, s, remains, were, first, buried, at, the, chapel, of, wonders, at, the, convent, of, st, francis, valladolid, but, were, then, moved, to, the, monastery, of, la, cartuja, in, seville, southern, spain, by, the, will, of, his, son, diego, they, may, have, been, exhumed, in, 1513, and, interred, at, the, seville, cathedral, in, about, 1536, the, remains, of, both, columbus, and, his, son, diego, were, moved, to, a, cathedral, in, colonial, santo, domingo, in, the, present, day, dominican, republic, columbus, had, requested, to, be, buried, on, the, island, by, some, accounts, in, 1793, when, france, took, over, the, entire, island, of, hispaniola, columbus, s, remains, were, moved, to, havana, cuba, after, cuba, became, independent, following, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, at, least, some, of, these, remains, were, moved, back, to, the, seville, cathedral, where, they, were, placed, on, an, elaborate, catafalque, in, june, 2003, dna, samples, were, taken, from, the, remains, in, seville, as, well, as, those, of, columbus, s, brother, diego, and, younger, son, fernando, initial, observations, suggested, that, the, bones, did, not, appear, to, match, columbus, s, physique, or, age, at, death, dna, extraction, proved, difficult, only, short, fragments, of, mitochondrial, dna, could, be, isolated, these, matched, corresponding, dna, from, columbus, s, brother, supporting, that, the, two, men, had, the, same, mother, such, evidence, together, with, anthropologic, and, historic, analyses, led, the, researchers, to, conclude, that, the, remains, belonged, to, christopher, columbus, in, 1877, a, priest, discovered, a, lead, box, at, santo, domingo, inscribed, discoverer, of, america, first, admiral, inscriptions, found, the, next, year, read, last, of, the, remains, of, the, first, admiral, sire, christopher, columbus, discoverer, the, box, contained, bones, of, an, arm, and, a, leg, as, well, as, a, bullet, these, remains, were, considered, legitimate, by, physician, and, u, s, assistant, secretary, of, state, john, eugene, osborne, who, suggested, in, 1913, that, they, travel, through, the, panama, canal, as, a, part, of, its, opening, ceremony, these, remains, were, kept, at, the, basilica, cathedral, of, santa, mar, a, la, menor, in, the, colonial, city, of, santo, domingo, before, being, moved, to, the, columbus, lighthouse, santo, domingo, este, inaugurated, in, 1992, the, authorities, in, santo, domingo, have, never, allowed, these, remains, to, be, dna, tested, so, it, is, unconfirmed, whether, they, are, from, columbus, s, body, as, well, the, figure, of, columbus, was, not, ignored, in, the, british, colonies, during, the, colonial, era, columbus, became, a, unifying, symbol, early, in, the, history, of, the, colonies, that, became, the, united, states, when, puritan, preachers, began, to, use, his, life, story, as, a, model, for, a, developing, american, spirit, in, the, spring, of, 1692, puritan, preacher, cotton, mather, described, columbus, s, voyage, as, one, of, three, shaping, events, of, the, modern, age, connecting, columbus, s, voyage, and, the, puritans, migration, to, north, america, seeing, them, together, as, the, key, to, a, grand, design, the, use, of, columbus, as, a, founding, figure, of, new, world, nations, spread, rapidly, after, the, american, revolution, this, was, out, of, a, desire, to, develop, a, national, history, and, founding, myth, with, fewer, ties, to, britain, his, name, was, the, basis, for, the, female, national, personification, of, the, united, states, columbia, in, use, since, the, 1730s, with, reference, to, the, original, thirteen, colonies, and, also, a, historical, name, applied, to, the, americas, and, to, the, new, world, columbia, south, carolina, and, columbia, rediviva, the, ship, for, which, the, columbia, river, was, named, are, named, for, columbus, columbus, s, name, was, given, to, the, newly, born, republic, of, colombia, in, the, early, 19th, century, inspired, by, the, political, project, of, colombeia, developed, by, revolutionary, francisco, de, miranda, which, was, put, at, the, service, of, the, emancipation, of, continental, hispanic, america, to, commemorate, the, 400th, anniversary, of, the, landing, of, columbus, the,

nationalist, project, undertaken, in, spain, during, the, restoration, in, the, late, 19th, century, took, form, with, the, commemoration, of, the, 4th, centenary, on, 12, october, 1892, in, which, the, figure, of, columbus, was, extolled, by, the, conservative, government, eventually, becoming, the, very, same, national, day, several, monuments, commemorating, the, discovery, were, erected, in, cities, such, as, palos, barcelona, granada, madrid, salamanca, valladolid, and, seville, in, the, years, around, the, 400th, anniversary, for, the, columbus, quincentenary, in, 1992, a, second, columbian, issue, was, released, jointly, with, italy, portugal, and, spain, columbus, was, celebrated, at, seville, expo, 92, and, genoa, expo, 92, the, boal, mansion, museum, founded, in, 1951, contains, a, collection, of, materials, concerning, later, descendants, of, columbus, and, collateral, branches, of, the, family, it, features, a, 16th, century, chapel, from, a, spanish, castle, reputedly, owned, by, diego, col, n, which, became, the, residence, of, columbus, s, descendants, the, chapel, interior, was, dismantled, and, moved, from, spain, in, 1909, and, re, erected, on, the, boal, estate, at, boalsburg, pennsylvania, inside, it, are, numerous, religious, paintings, and, other, objects, including, a, reliquary, with, fragments, of, wood, supposedly, from, the, true, cross, the, museum, also, holds, a, collection, of, documents, mostly, relating, to, columbus, descendants, of, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, in, many, countries, of, the, americas, as, well, as, spain, and, italy, columbus, day, celebrates, the, anniversary, of, columbus, s, arrival, in, the, americas, on, 12, october, 1492, the, voyages, of, columbus, are, considered, a, turning, point, in, human, history, marking, the, beginning, of, globalization, and, accompanying, demographic, commercial, economic, social, and, political, changes, his, explorations, resulted, in, permanent, contact, between, the, two, hemispheres, and, the, term, pre, columbian, is, used, to, refer, to, the, cultures, of, the, americas, before, the, arrival, of, columbus, and, his, european, successors, the, ensuing, columbian, exchange, saw, the, massive, exchange, of, animals, plants, fungi, diseases, technologies, mineral, wealth, and, ideas, in, the, first, century, after, his, endeavors, columbus, s, figure, largely, languished, in, the, backwaters, of, history, and, his, reputation, was, beset, by, his, failures, as, a, colonial, administrator, his, legacy, was, somewhat, rescued, from, oblivion, when, he, began, to, appear, as, a, character, in, italian, and, spanish, plays, and, poems, from, the, late, 16th, century, onward, columbus, was, subsumed, into, the, western, narrative, of, colonization, and, empire, building, which, invoked, notions, of, translatio, imperii, and, translatio, studii, to, underline, who, was, considered, civilized, and, who, was, not, the, americanization, of, the, figure, of, columbus, began, in, the, latter, decades, of, the, 18th, century, after, the, revolutionary, period, of, the, united, states, elevating, the, status, of, his, reputation, to, a, national, myth, homo, americanus, his, landing, became, a, powerful, icon, as, an, image, of, american, genesis, the, discovery, of, america, sculpture, depicting, columbus, and, a, cowering, native, maiden, was, commissioned, on, 3, april, 1837, when, u, s, president, martin, van, buren, sanctioned, the, engineering, of, luigi, persico, s, design, this, representation, of, columbus, s, triumph, and, the, native, s, recoil, is, a, demonstration, of, supposed, white, superiority, over, savage, naive, natives, as, recorded, during, its, unveiling, in, 1844, the, sculpture, extends, to, represent, the, meeting, of, the, two, races, as, persico, captures, their, first, interaction, highlighting, the, moral, and, intellectual, inferiority, of, natives, placed, outside, the, u, s, capitol, building, where, it, remained, until, its, removal, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, sculpture, reflected, the, contemporary, view, of, whites, in, the, u, s, toward, the, natives, they, are, labeled, merciless, indian, savages, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, in, 1836, pennsylvania, senator, and, future, u, s, president, james, buchanan, who, proposed, the, sculpture, described, it, as, representing, the, great, discoverer, when, he, first, bounded, with, ecstasy, upon, the, shore, ail, his, toils, past, presenting, a, hemisphere, to, the, astonished, world, with, the, name, america, inscribed, upon, it, whilst, he, is, thus, standing, upon, the, shore, a, female, savage, with, awe, and, wonder, depicted, in, her, countenance, is, gazing, upon, him, the, american, columbus, myth, was, reconfigured, later, in, the, century, when, he, was, enlisted, as, an, ethnic, hero, by, immigrants, to, the, united, states, who, were, not, of, anglo, saxon, stock, such, as, jewish, italian, and, irish, people, who, claimed, columbus, as, a, sort, of, ethnic, founding, father, catholics, unsuccessfully, tried, to, promote, him, for, canonization, in, the, 19th, century, from, the, 1990s, onward, a, narrative, of, columbus, being, responsible, for, the, genocide, of, indigenous, peoples, and, environmental, destruction, began, to, compete, with, the, then, predominant, discourse, of, columbus, as, christ, bearer, scientist, or, father, of, america, this, narrative, features, the, negative, effects, of, columbus, conquests, on, native, populations, exposed, to, old, world, diseases, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, new, world, collapsed, and, were, largely, replaced, by, europeans, and, africans, who, brought, with, them, new, methods, of, farming, business, governance, and, religious, worship, though, christopher, columbus, came, to, be, considered, the, european, discoverer, of, america, in, western, popular, culture, his, historical, legacy, is, more, nuanced, after, settling, iceland, the, norse, settled, the, uninhabited, southern, part, of, greenland, beginning, in, the, 10th, century, norsemen, are, believed, to, have, then, set, sail, from, greenland, and, iceland, to, become, the, first, known, europeans, to, reach, the, north, american, mainland, nearly, 500, years, before, columbus, reached, the, caribbean, the, 1960s, discovery, of, a, norse, settlement, dating, to, c, 1000, ad, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, newfoundland, partially, corroborates, accounts, within, the, icelandic, sagas, of, erik, the, red, s, colonization, of, greenland, and, his, son, leif, erikson, s, subsequent, exploration, of, a, place, he, called, vinland, in, the, 19th, century, amid, a, revival, of, interest, in, norse, culture, carl, christian, rafn, and, benjamin, franklin, decosta, wrote, works, establishing, that, the, norse, had, preceded, columbus, in, colonizing, the, americas, following, this, in, 1874, rasmus, bj, rn, anderson, argued, that, columbus, must, have, known, of, the, north, american, continent, before, he, started, his, voyage, of, discovery, most, modern, scholars, doubt, columbus, had, knowledge, of, the, norse, settlements, in, america, with, his, arrival, to, the, continent, being, most, likely, an, independent, discovery, europeans, devised, explanations, for, the, origins, of, the, native, americans, and, their, geographical, distribution, with, narratives, that, often, served, to, reinforce, their, own, preconceptions, built, on, ancient, intellectual, foundations, in, modern, latin, america, the, non, native, populations, of, some, countries, often, demonstrate, an, ambiguous, attitude, toward, the, perspectives, of, indigenous, peoples, regarding, the, so, called, discovery, by, columbus, and, the, era, of, colonialism, that, followed, in, his, 1960, monograph, mexican, philosopher, and, historian, edmundo, o, gorman, explicitly, rejects, the, columbus, discovery, myth, arguing, that, the, idea, that, columbus, discovered, america, was, a, misleading, legend, fixed, in, the, public, mind, through, the, works, of, american, author, washington, irving, during, the, 19th, century, o, gorman, argues, that, to, assert, columbus, discovered, america, is, to, shape, the, facts, concerning, the, events, of, 1492, to, make, them, conform, to, an, interpretation, that, arose, many, years, later, for, him, the, eurocentric, view, of, the, discovery, of, america, sustains, systems, of, domination, in, ways, that, favor, europeans, in, a, 1992, article, for, the, unesco, courier, f, lix, fern, ndez, shaw, argues, that, the, word, discovery, prioritizes, european, explorers, as, the, heroes, of, the, contact, between, the, old, and, new, world, he, suggests, that, the, word, encounter, is, more, appropriate, being, a, more, universal, term, which, includes, native, americans, in, the, narrative, historians, have, traditionally, argued, that, columbus, remained, convinced, until, his, death, that, his, journeys, had, been, along, the, east, coast, of, asia, as, he, originally, intended, excluding, arguments, such, as, anderson, s, on, his, third, voyage, he, briefly, referred, to, south, america, as, a, hitherto, unknown, continent, while, also, rationalizing, that, it, was, the, earthly, paradise, eden, located, at, the, end, of, the, orient, columbus, continued, to, claim, in, his, later, writings, that, he, had, reached, asia, in, a, 1502, letter, to, pope, alexander, vi, he, asserts, that, cuba, is, the, east, coast, of, asia, on, the, other, hand, in, a, document, in, the, book, of, privileges, 1502, columbus, refers, to, the, new, world, as, the, indias, occidentales, west, indies, which, he, says, were, unknown, to, all, the, world, washington, irving, s, 1828, biography, of, columbus, popularized, the, idea, that, columbus, had, difficulty, obtaining, support, for, his, plan, because, many, catholic, theologians, insisted, that, the, earth, was, flat, but, this, is, a, popular, misconception, which, can, be, traced, back, to, 17th, century, protestants, campaigning, against, catholicism, in, fact, the, spherical, shape, of, the, earth, had, been, known, to, scholars, since, antiquity, and, was, common, knowledge, among, sailors, including, columbus, coincidentally, the, oldest, surviving, globe, of, the, earth, the, erdapfel, was, made, in, 1492, just, before, columbus, s, return, to, europe, from, his, first, voyage, as, such, it, contains, no, sign, of, the, americas, and, yet, demonstrates, the, common, belief, in, a, spherical, earth, in, 1492, columbus, correctly, measured, polaris, s, diurnal, motion, around, true, north, as, having, a, diameter, of, almost, 7, in, 1498, while, sailing, west, through, the, doldrums, 8, north, in, july, and, again, in, august, sailing, the, trade, winds, 13, north, columbus, reported, seeing, polaris, with, a, diurnal, motion, of, 10, in, diameter, he, accounted, for, the, shift, by, concluding, that, earth, s, figure, is, pear, shaped, with, the, stalk, portion, comparing, this, to, a, woman, s, breast, being, nearest, heaven, and, upon, which, was, centered, the, earthly, paradise, although, columbus, s, later, readings, were, incorrect, 20th, century, satellite, data, happens, to, indicate, that, the, earth, has, a, slight, pear, shape, columbus, has, been, criticized, both, for, his, brutality, and, for, initiating, the, depopulation, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, caribbean, whether, by, imported, diseases, or, intentional, violence, according, to, scholars, of, native, american, history, george, tinker, and, mark, freedman, columbus, was, responsible, for, creating, a, cycle, of, murder, violence, and, slavery, to, maximize, exploitation, of, the, caribbean, islands, resources, and, that, native, deaths, on, the, scale, at, which, they, occurred, would, not, have, been, caused, by, new, diseases, alone, further, they, describe, the, proposition, that, disease, and, not, genocide, caused, these, deaths, as, american, holocaust, denial, historian, kris, lane, disputes, whether, it, is, appropriate, to, use, the, term, genocide, when, the, atrocities, were, not, columbus, s, intent, but, resulted, from, his, decrees, family, business, goals, and, negligence, other, scholars, defend, columbus, s, actions, or, allege, that, the, worst, accusations, against, him, are, not, based, in, fact, while, others, claim, that, he, has, been, blamed, for, events, far, beyond, his, own, reach, or, knowledge, as, a, result, of, the, protests, and, riots, that, followed, the, murder, of, george, floyd, in, 2020, many, public, monuments, of, christopher, columbus, have, been, removed, some, historians, have, criticized, columbus, for, initiating, the, widespread, colonization, of, the, americas, and, for, abusing, its, native, population, on, st, croix, columbus, s, friend, michele, da, cuneo, according, to, his, own, account, kept, an, indigenous, woman, he, captured, whom, columbus, gave, to, then, brutally, raped, her, according, to, some, historians, the, punishment, for, an, indigenous, person, aged, 14, and, older, failing, to, pay, a, hawk, s, bell, or, cascabela, worth, of, gold, dust, every, six, months, based, on, bartolom, de, las, casas, s, account, was, cutting, off, the, hands, of, those, without, tokens, often, leaving, them, to, bleed, to, death, other, historians, dispute, such, accounts, for, example, a, study, of, spanish, archival, sources, showed, that, the, cascabela, quotas, were, imposed, by, guarionex, not, columbus, and, that, there, is, no, mention, in, the, primary, sources, of, punishment, by, cutting, off, hands, for, failing, to, pay, columbus, had, an, economic, interest, in, the, enslavement, of, the, hispaniola, natives, and, for, that, reason, was, not, eager, to, baptize, them, which, attracted, criticism, from, some, churchmen, consuelo, varela, a, spanish, historian, stated, that, columbus, s, government, was, characterized, by, a, form, of, tyranny, even, those, who, loved, him, had, to, admit, the, atrocities, that, had, taken, place, other, historians, have, argued, that, some, of, the, accounts, of, the, brutality, of, columbus, and, his, brothers, have, been, exaggerated, as, part, of, the, black, legend, a, historical, tendency, towards, anti, spanish, and, anti, catholic, sentiment, in, historical, sources, dating, as, far, back, as, the, 16th, century, which, they, speculate, may, continue, to, taint, scholarship, into, the, present, day, according, to, historian, emily, berquist, soule, the, immense, portuguese, profits, from, the, maritime, trade, in, african, slaves, along, the, west, african, coast, served, as, an, inspiration, for, columbus, to, create, a, counterpart, of, this, apparatus, in, the, new, world, using, indigenous, american, slaves, historian, william, j, connell, has, argued, that, while, columbus, brought, the, entrepreneurial, form, of, slavery, to, the, new, world, this, was, a, phenomenon, of, the, times, further, arguing, that, we, have, to, be, very, careful, about, applying, 20th, century, understandings, of, morality, to, the, morality, of, the, 15th, century, in, a, less, popular, defense, of, colonization, spanish, ambassador, mar, a, jes, s, figa, has, argued, normally, we, melded, with, the, cultures, in, america, we, stayed, there, we, spread, our, language, and, culture, and, religion, british, historian, basil, davidson, has, dubbed, columbus, the, father, of, the, slave, trade, citing, the, fact, that, the, first, license, to, ship, enslaved, africans, to, the, caribbean, was, issued, by, the, catholic, monarchs, in, 1501, to, the, first, royal, governor, of, hispaniola, nicol, s, de, ovando, around, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, estimates, for, the, pre, columbian, population, of, hispaniola, ranged, between, 250, 000, and, two, million, but, genetic, analysis, published, in, late, 2020, suggests, that, smaller, figures, are, more, likely, perhaps, as, low, as, 10, 000, 50, 000, for, hispaniola, and, puerto, rico, combined, based, on, the, previous, figures, of, a, few, hundred, thousand, some, have, estimated, that, a, third, or, more, of, the, natives, in, haiti, were, dead, within, the, first, two, years, of, columbus, s, governorship, contributors, to, depopulation, included, disease, warfare, and, harsh, enslavement, indirect, evidence, suggests, that, some, serious, illness, may, have, arrived, with, the, 1, 500, colonists, who, accompanied, columbus, second, expedition, in, 1493, charles, c, mann, writes, that, it, was, as, if, the, suffering, these, diseases, had, caused, in, eurasia, over, the, past, millennia, were, concentrated, into, the, span, of, decades, a, third, of, the, natives, forced, to, work, in, gold, and, silver, mines, died, every, six, months, within, three, to, six, decades, the, surviving, arawak, population, numbered, only, in, the, hundreds, the, indigenous, population, of, the, americas, overall, is, thought, to, have, been, reduced, by, about, 90, in, the, century, after, columbus, s, arrival, among, indigenous, peoples, columbus, is, often, viewed, as, a, key, agent, of, genocide, samuel, eliot, morison, a, harvard, university, historian, and, author, of, a, multivolume, biography, on, columbus, writes, the, cruel, policy, initiated, by, columbus, and, pursued, by, his, successors, resulted, in, complete, genocide, according, to, noble, david, cook, there, were, too, few, spaniards, to, have, killed, the, millions, who, were, reported, to, have, died, in, the, first, century, after, old, and, new, world, contact, he, instead, estimates, that, the, death, toll, was, caused, by, smallpox, which, may, have, caused, a, pandemic, only, after, the, arrival, of, hern, n, cort, s, in, 1519, according, to, some, estimates, smallpox, had, an, 80, 90, fatality, rate, in, native, american, populations, the, natives, had, no, acquired, immunity, to, these, new, diseases, and, suffered, high, fatalities, there, is, also, evidence, that, they, had, poor, diets, and, were, overworked, historian, andr, s, res, ndez, of, university, of, california, davis, says, the, available, evidence, suggests, slavery, has, emerged, as, major, killer, of, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, caribbean, between, 1492, and, 1550, more, so, than, diseases, such, as, smallpox, influenza, and, malaria, he, says, that, indigenous, populations, did, not, experience, a, rebound, like, european, populations, did, following, the, black, death, because, unlike, the, latter, a, large, portion, of, the, former, were, subjected, to, deadly, forced, labor, in, the, mines, the, diseases, that, devastated, the, native, americans, came, in, multiple, waves, at, different, times, sometimes, as, much, as, centuries, apart, which, would, mean, that, survivors, of, one, disease, may, have, been, killed, by, others, preventing, the, population, from, recovering, historian, david, stannard, describes, the, depopulation, of, the, indigenous, americans, as, neither, inadvertent, nor, inevitable, saying, it, was, the, result, of, both, disease, and, intentional, genocide, biographers, and, historians, have, a, wide, range, of, opinions, about, columbus, s, expertise, and, experience, navigating, and, captaining, ships, one, scholar, lists, some, european, works, ranging, from, the, 1890s, to, 1980s, that, support, columbus, s, experience, and, skill, as, among, the, best, in, genoa, while, listing, some, american, works, over, a, similar, timeframe, that, portray, the, explorer, as, an, untrained, entrepreneur, having, only, minor, crew, or, passenger, experience, prior, to, his, noted, journeys, according, to, morison, columbus, s, success, in, utilizing, the, trade, winds, might, owe, significantly, to, luck, contemporary, descriptions, of, columbus, including, those, by, his, son, fernando, and, bartolom, de, las, casas, describe, him, as, taller, than, average, with, light, skin, often, sunburnt, blue, or, hazel, eyes, high, cheekbones, and, freckled, face, an, aquiline, nose, and, blond, to, reddish, hair, and, beard, until, about, the, age, of, 30, when, it, began, to, whiten, one, spanish, commentator, described, his, eyes, using, the, word, garzos, now, usually, translated, as, light, blue, but, it, seems, to, have, indicated, light, grey, green, or, hazel, eyes, to, columbus, s, contemporaries, the, word, rubios, can, mean, blond, fair, or, ruddy, although, an, abundance, of, artwork, depicts, columbus, no, authentic, contemporary, portrait, is, known, a, well, known, image, of, columbus, is, a, portrait, by, sebastiano, del, piombo, which, has, been, reproduced, in, many, textbooks, it, agrees, with, descriptions, of, columbus, in, that, it, shows, a,
