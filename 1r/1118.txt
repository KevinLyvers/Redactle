and, aided, by, him, and, his, pupils, in, 1132, the, defeated, army, of, zengi, atabeg, of, mosul, found, their, retreat, blocked, by, the, tigris, river, opposite, the, fortress, of, tikrit, where,

of, zengi, in, 1146, his, son, nur, ad, din, became, the, regent, of, aleppo, and, the, leader, of, the, zengids, saladin, who, now, lived, in, damascus, was, reported, to, have, a, particular, fondness, for, the, city, but, information, on, his, early, childhood, is, scarce, about, education, saladin, wrote, children, are, brought, up, in, the, way, in, which, their, elders, were, brought, up, according, to, his, biographers, anne, marie, edd, and, al, wahrani, saladin, was, able, to, answer, questions, on, euclid, the, almagest, arithmetic, and, law, but, this, was, an, academic, ideal, it, was, his, knowledge, of, the, qur, an, and, the, sciences, of, religion, that, linked, him, to, his, contemporaries, several, sources, claim, that, during, his, studies, he, was, more, interested, in, religious, studies, than, joining, the, military, another, factor, which, may, have, affected, his, interest, in, religion, was, that, during, the, first, crusade, jerusalem, was, taken, by, the, christians, in, addition, to, islam, saladin, had, a, knowledge, of, the, genealogies, biographies, and, histories, of, the, arabs, as, well, as, the, bloodlines, of, arabian, horses, more, significantly, he, knew, the, hamasah, of, abu, tammam, by, heart, he, spoke, kurdish, and, arabic, and, knew, turkish, and, persian, according, to, baha, ad, din, ibn, shaddad, one, of, saladin, s, contemporary, biographers, saladin, was, a, pious, muslim, he, loved, hearing, quran, recitals, prayed, punctually, and, hated, the, philosophers, those, that, denied, god, s, attributes, the, materialists, and, those, who, stubbornly, rejected, the, holy, law, he, was, also, a, supporter, of, sufism, and, a, patron, of, khanqahs, sufi, hostels, in, egypt, and, syria, in, addition, to, madrasas, that, provided, orthodox, sunni, teachings, above, all, else, he, was, a, devotee, of, jihad, the, sacred, works, are, full, of, passages, referring, to, the, jihad, saladin, was, more, assiduous, and, zealous, in, this, than, in, anything, else, jihad, and, the, suffering, involved, in, it, weighed, heavily, on, his, heart, and, his, whole, being, in, every, limb, he, spoke, of, nothing, else, thought, only, about, equipment, for, the, fight, was, interested, only, in, those, who, had, taken, up, arms, had, little, sympathy, with, anyone, who, spoke, of, anything, else, or, encouraged, any, other, activity, in, 1174, saladin, ordered, the, arrest, of, a, sufi, mystic, qadid, al, qaffas, arabic, in, alexandria, in, 1191, he, ordered, his, son, to, execute, the, sufi, philosopher, yahya, al, suhrawardi, the, founder, of, the, illuminationist, current, in, islamic, philosophy, in, aleppo, ibn, shaddad, who, describes, this, event, as, part, of, his, chapter, on, the, sultan, s, piety, states, that, al, suhrawardi, was, said, to, have, rejected, the, holy, law, and, declared, it, invalid, after, consulting, with, some, of, the, ulama, religious, scholars, saladin, ordered, al, suhrawardi, s, execution, saladin, also, opposed, the, order, of, assassins, an, extremist, isma, ili, shi, i, sect, in, iran, and, syria, seeing, them, as, heretics, and, as, being, too, close, with, the, crusaders, saladin, welcomed, asiatic, sufis, to, egypt, and, he, and, his, followers, founded, and, endowed, many, khanqahs, and, zawiyas, of, which, al, maqrizi, gives, a, long, list, but, it, is, not, yet, clear, what, saladin, s, interests, in, the, khanqah, actually, were, and, why, he, specifically, wanted, sufis, from, outside, egypt, the, answers, to, these, questions, lie, in, the, kinds, of, sufis, he, wished, to, attract, in, addition, to, requiring, that, the, sufis, come, from, outside, egypt, the, waqfiyya, seems, to, have, specified, that, they, be, of, a, very, particular, type, the, inhabitants, of, the, khanqah, were, known, for, religious, knowledge, and, piety, and, their, baraka, blessings, was, sought, after, the, founder, stipulated, that, the, khanqah, be, endowed, for, the, sufis, as, a, group, those, coming, from, abroad, and, settling, in, cairo, and, fustat, if, those, could, not, be, found, then, it, would, be, for, the, poor, jurists, either, shafi, i, or, maliki, and, ash, ari, in, their, creed, saladin, s, military, career, began, under, the, tutelage, of, his, paternal, uncle, asad, ad, din, shirkuh, a, prominent, military, commander, under, nur, ad, din, the, zengid, emir, of, damascus, and, aleppo, and, the, most, influential, teacher, of, saladin, in, 1163, the, vizier, to, the, fatimid, caliph, al, adid, shawar, had, been, driven, out, of, egypt, by, his, rival, dirgham, a, member, of, the, powerful, banu, ruzzaik, tribe, he, asked, for, military, backing, from, nur, ad, din, who, complied, and, in, 1164, sent, shirkuh, to, aid, shawar, in, his, expedition, against, dirgham, saladin, at, age, 26, went, along, with, them, after, shawar, was, successfully, reinstated, as, vizier, he, demanded, that, shirkuh, withdraw, his, army, from, egypt, for, a, sum, of, 30, 000, gold, dinars, but, he, refused, insisting, it, was, nur, ad, din, s, will, that, he, remain, saladin, s, role, in, this, expedition, was, minor, and, it, is, known, that, he, was, ordered, by, shirkuh, to, collect, stores, from, bilbais, prior, to, its, siege, by, a, combined, force, of, crusaders, and, shawar, s, troops, after, the, sacking, of, bilbais, the, crusader, egyptian, force, and, shirkuh, s, army, were, to, engage, in, the, battle, of, al, babein, on, the, desert, border, of, the, nile, just, west, of, giza, saladin, played, a, major, role, commanding, the, right, wing, of, the, zengid, army, while, a, force, of, kurds, commanded, the, left, and, shirkuh, was, stationed, in, the, centre, muslim, sources, at, the, time, however, put, saladin, in, the, baggage, of, the, centre, with, orders, to, lure, the, enemy, into, a, trap, by, staging, a, feigned, retreat, the, crusader, force, enjoyed, early, success, against, shirkuh, s, troops, but, the, terrain, was, too, steep, and, sandy, for, their, horses, and, commander, hugh, of, caesarea, was, captured, while, attacking, saladin, s, unit, after, scattered, fighting, in, little, valleys, to, the, south, of, the, main, position, the, zengid, central, force, returned, to, the, offensive, saladin, joined, in, from, the, rear, the, battle, ended, in, a, zengid, victory, and, saladin, is, credited, with, having, helped, shirkuh, in, one, of, the, most, remarkable, victories, in, recorded, history, according, to, ibn, al, athir, although, more, of, shirkuh, s, men, were, killed, and, the, battle, is, considered, by, most, sources, as, not, a, total, victory, saladin, and, shirkuh, moved, towards, alexandria, where, they, were, welcomed, given, money, and, arms, and, provided, a, base, faced, by, a, superior, crusader, egyptian, force, attempting, to, besiege, the, city, shirkuh, split, his, army, he, and, the, bulk, of, his, force, withdrew, from, alexandria, while, saladin, was, left, with, the, task, of, guarding, the, city, shirkuh, was, in, a, power, struggle, over, egypt, with, shawar, and, amalric, i, of, jerusalem, in, which, shawar, requested, amalric, s, assistance, in, 1169, shawar, was, reportedly, assassinated, by, saladin, and, shirkuh, died, later, that, year, following, his, death, a, number, of, candidates, were, considered, for, the, role, of, vizier, to, al, adid, most, of, whom, were, ethnic, kurds, their, ethnic, solidarity, came, to, shape, the, ayyubid, family, s, actions, in, their, political, career, saladin, and, his, close, associates, were, wary, of, turkish, influence, on, one, occasion, isa, al, hakkari, a, kurdish, lieutenant, of, saladin, urged, a, candidate, for, the, viziership, emir, qutb, ad, din, al, hadhbani, to, step, aside, by, arguing, that, both, you, and, saladin, are, kurds, and, you, will, not, let, the, power, pass, into, the, hands, of, the, turks, nur, ad, din, chose, a, successor, for, shirkuh, but, al, adid, appointed, saladin, to, replace, shawar, as, vizier, the, reasoning, behind, the, shia, caliph, al, adid, s, selection, of, saladin, a, sunni, varies, ibn, al, athir, claims, that, the, caliph, chose, him, after, being, told, by, his, advisers, that, there, is, no, one, weaker, or, younger, than, saladin, and, not, one, of, the, emirs, obeyed, him, or, served, him, however, according, to, this, version, after, some, bargaining, he, was, eventually, accepted, by, the, majority, of, the, emirs, al, adid, s, advisers, were, also, suspected, of, promoting, saladin, in, an, attempt, to, split, the, syria, based, zengids, al, wahrani, wrote, that, saladin, was, selected, because, of, the, reputation, of, his, family, in, their, generosity, and, military, prowess, imad, ad, din, wrote, that, after, the, brief, mourning, period, for, shirkuh, during, which, opinions, differed, the, zengid, emirs, decided, upon, saladin, and, forced, the, caliph, to, invest, him, as, vizier, although, positions, were, complicated, by, rival, muslim, leaders, the, bulk, of, the, syrian, commanders, supported, saladin, because, of, his, role, in, the, egyptian, expedition, in, which, he, gained, a, record, of, military, qualifications, inaugurated, as, vizier, on, 26, march, saladin, repented, wine, drinking, and, turned, from, frivolity, to, assume, the, dress, of, religion, according, to, arabic, sources, of, the, time, having, gained, more, power, and, independence, than, ever, before, in, his, career, he, still, faced, the, issue, of, ultimate, loyalty, between, al, adid, and, nur, ad, din, later, in, the, year, a, group, of, egyptian, soldiers, and, emirs, attempted, to, assassinate, saladin, but, having, already, known, of, their, intentions, thanks, to, his, intelligence, chief, ali, ibn, safyan, he, had, the, chief, conspirator, naji, mu, tamin, al, khilafa, the, civilian, controller, of, the, fatimid, palace, arrested, and, killed, the, day, after, 50, 000, black, african, soldiers, from, the, regiments, of, the, fatimid, army, opposed, to, saladin, s, rule, along, with, egyptian, emirs, and, commoners, staged, a, revolt, by, 23, august, saladin, had, decisively, quelled, the, uprising, and, never, again, had, to, face, a, military, challenge, from, cairo, towards, the, end, of, 1169, saladin, with, reinforcements, from, nur, ad, din, defeated, a, massive, crusader, byzantine, force, near, damietta, afterwards, in, the, spring, of, 1170, nur, ad, din, sent, saladin, s, father, to, egypt, in, compliance, with, saladin, s, request, as, well, as, encouragement, from, the, baghdad, based, abbasid, caliph, al, mustanjid, who, aimed, to, pressure, saladin, in, deposing, his, rival, caliph, al, ad, saladin, himself, had, been, strengthening, his, hold, on, egypt, and, widening, his, support, base, there, he, began, granting, his, family, members, high, ranking, positions, in, the, region, he, ordered, the, construction, of, a, college, for, the, maliki, branch, of, sunni, islam, in, the, city, as, well, as, one, for, the, shafi, i, denomination, to, which, he, belonged, in, al, fustat, after, establishing, himself, in, egypt, saladin, launched, a, campaign, against, the, crusaders, besieging, darum, in, 1170, amalric, withdrew, his, templar, garrison, from, gaza, to, assist, him, in, defending, darum, but, saladin, evaded, their, force, and, captured, gaza, in, 1187, in, 1191, saladin, destroyed, the, fortifications, in, gaza, built, by, king, baldwin, iii, for, the, knights, templar, it, is, unclear, exactly, when, but, during, that, same, year, he, attacked, and, captured, the, crusader, castle, of, eilat, built, on, an, island, off, the, head, of, the, gulf, of, aqaba, it, did, not, pose, a, threat, to, the, passage, of, the, muslim, navy, but, could, harass, smaller, parties, of, muslim, ships, and, saladin, decided, to, clear, it, from, his, path, according, to, imad, ad, din, nur, ad, din, wrote, to, saladin, in, june, 1171, telling, him, to, reestablish, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, egypt, which, saladin, coordinated, two, months, later, after, additional, encouragement, by, najm, ad, din, al, khabushani, the, shafi, i, faqih, who, vehemently, opposed, shia, rule, in, the, country, several, egyptian, emirs, were, thus, killed, but, al, adid, was, told, that, they, were, killed, for, rebelling, against, him, he, then, fell, ill, or, was, poisoned, according, to, one, account, while, ill, he, asked, saladin, to, pay, him, a, visit, to, request, that, he, take, care, of, his, young, children, but, saladin, refused, fearing, treachery, against, the, abbasids, and, is, said, to, have, regretted, his, action, after, realizing, what, al, adid, had, wanted, he, died, on, 13, september, and, five, days, later, the, abbasid, khutba, was, pronounced, in, cairo, and, al, fustat, proclaiming, al, mustadi, as, caliph, on, 25, september, saladin, left, cairo, to, take, part, in, a, joint, attack, on, kerak, and, montr, al, the, desert, castles, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, with, nur, ad, din, who, would, attack, from, syria, prior, to, arriving, at, montreal, saladin, however, withdrew, back, to, cairo, as, he, received, the, reports, that, in, his, absence, the, crusader, leaders, had, increased, their, support, to, the, traitors, inside, egypt, to, attack, saladin, from, within, and, lessen, his, power, especially, the, fatimid, who, started, plotting, to, restore, their, past, glory, because, of, this, nur, ad, din, went, on, alone, during, the, summer, of, 1173, a, nubian, army, along, with, a, contingent, of, armenian, former, fatimid, troops, were, reported, on, the, egyptian, border, preparing, for, a, siege, against, aswan, the, emir, of, the, city, had, requested, saladin, s, assistance, and, was, given, reinforcements, under, turan, shah, saladin, s, brother, consequently, the, nubians, departed, but, returned, in, 1173, and, were, again, driven, off, this, time, egyptian, forces, advanced, from, aswan, and, captured, the, nubian, town, of, ibrim, saladin, sent, a, gift, to, nur, ad, din, who, had, been, his, friend, and, teacher, 60, 000, dinars, wonderful, manufactured, goods, some, jewels, and, an, elephant, while, transporting, these, goods, to, damascus, saladin, took, the, opportunity, to, ravage, the, crusader, countryside, he, did, not, press, an, attack, against, the, desert, castles, but, attempted, to, drive, out, the, muslim, bedouins, who, lived, in, crusader, territory, with, the, aim, of, depriving, the, franks, of, guides, on, 31, july, 1173, saladin, s, father, ayyub, was, wounded, in, a, horse, riding, accident, ultimately, causing, his, death, on, 9, august, in, 1174, saladin, sent, turan, shah, to, conquer, yemen, to, allocate, it, and, its, port, aden, to, the, territories, of, the, ayyubid, dynasty, in, the, early, summer, of, 1174, nur, ad, din, was, mustering, an, army, sending, summons, to, mosul, diyar, bakr, and, the, jazira, in, an, apparent, preparation, of, an, attack, against, saladin, s, egypt, the, ayyubids, held, a, council, upon, the, revelation, of, these, preparations, to, discuss, the, possible, threat, and, saladin, collected, his, own, troops, outside, cairo, on, 15, may, nur, ad, din, died, after, falling, ill, the, previous, week, and, his, power, was, handed, to, his, eleven, year, old, son, as, salih, ismail, al, malik, his, death, left, saladin, with, political, independence, and, in, a, letter, to, as, salih, he, promised, to, act, as, a, sword, against, his, enemies, and, referred, to, the, death, of, his, father, as, an, earthquake, shock, in, the, wake, of, nur, ad, din, s, death, saladin, faced, a, difficult, decision, he, could, move, his, army, against, the, crusaders, from, egypt, or, wait, until, invited, by, as, salih, in, syria, to, come, to, his, aid, and, launch, a, war, from, there, he, could, also, take, it, upon, himself, to, annex, syria, before, it, could, possibly, fall, into, the, hands, of, a, rival, but, he, feared, that, attacking, a, land, that, formerly, belonged, to, his, master, forbidden, in, the, islamic, principles, in, which, he, believed, could, portray, him, as, hypocritical, thus, making, him, unsuitable, for, leading, the, war, against, the, crusaders, saladin, saw, that, in, order, to, acquire, syria, he, needed, either, an, invitation, from, as, salih, or, to, warn, him, that, potential, anarchy, could, give, rise, to, danger, from, the, crusaders, when, as, salih, was, removed, to, aleppo, in, august, gumushtigin, the, emir, of, the, city, and, a, captain, of, nur, ad, din, s, veterans, assumed, guardianship, over, him, the, emir, prepared, to, unseat, all, his, rivals, in, syria, and, the, jazira, beginning, with, damascus, in, this, emergency, the, emir, of, damascus, appealed, to, saif, ad, din, of, mosul, a, cousin, of, gumushtigin, for, assistance, against, aleppo, but, he, refused, forcing, the, syrians, to, request, the, aid, of, saladin, who, complied, saladin, rode, across, the, desert, with, 700, picked, horsemen, passing, through, al, kerak, then, reaching, bosra, according, to, his, own, account, was, joined, by, emirs, soldiers, and, bedouins, the, emotions, of, their, hearts, to, be, seen, on, their, faces, on, 23, november, he, arrived, in, damascus, amid, general, acclamation, and, rested, at, his, father, s, old, home, there, until, the, gates, of, the, citadel, of, damascus, whose, commander, raihan, initially, refused, to, surrender, were, opened, to, saladin, four, days, later, after, a, brief, siege, by, his, brother, tughtakin, ibn, ayyub, he, installed, himself, in, the, castle, and, received, the, homage, and, salutations, of, the, inhabitants, leaving, his, brother, tughtakin, ibn, ayyub, as, governor, of, damascus, saladin, proceeded, to, reduce, other, cities, that, had, belonged, to, nur, ad, din, but, were, now, practically, independent, his, army, conquered, hama, with, relative, ease, but, avoided, attacking, homs, because, of, the, strength, of, its, citadel, saladin, moved, north, towards, aleppo, besieging, it, on, 30, december, after, gumushtigin, refused, to, abdicate, his, throne, as, salih, fearing, capture, by, saladin, came, out, of, his, palace, and, appealed, to, the, inhabitants, not, to, surrender, him, and, the, city, to, the, invading, force, one, of, saladin, s, chroniclers, claimed, the, people, came, under, his, spell, gumushtigin, requested, rashid, ad, din, sinan, chief, da, i, of, the, assassins, of, syria, who, were, already, at, odds, with, saladin, since, he, replaced, the, fatimids, of, egypt, to, assassinate, saladin, in, his, camp, on, 11, may, 1175, a, group, of, thirteen, assassins, easily, gained, admission, into, saladin, s, camp, but, were, detected, immediately, before, they, carried, out, their, attack, by, nasih, ad, din, khumartekin, of, abu, qubays, one, was, killed, by, one, of, saladin, s, generals, and, the, others, were, slain, while, trying, to, escape, to, deter, saladin, s, progress, raymond, of, tripoli, gathered, his, forces, by, nahr, al, kabir, where, they, were, well, placed, for, an, attack, on, muslim, territory, saladin, later, moved, toward, homs, instead, but, retreated, after, being, told, a, relief, force, was, being, sent, to, the, city, by, saif, ad, din, meanwhile, saladin, s, rivals, in, syria, and, jazira, waged, a, propaganda, war, against, him, claiming, he, had, forgotten, his, own, condition, and, showed, no, gratitude, for, his, old, master, by, besieging, his, son, rising, in, rebellion, against, his, lord, saladin, aimed, to, counter, this, propaganda, by, ending, the, siege, claiming, that, he, was, defending, islam, from, the, crusaders, his, army, returned, to, hama, to, engage, a, crusader, force, there, the, crusaders, withdrew, beforehand, and, saladin, proclaimed, it, a, victory, opening, the, gates, of, men, s, hearts, soon, after, saladin, entered, homs, and, captured, its, citadel, in, march, 1175, after, stubborn, resistance, from, its, defenders, saladin, s, successes, alarmed, saif, ad, din, as, head, of, the, zengids, including, gumushtigin, he, regarded, syria, and, mesopotamia, as, his, family, estate, and, was, angered, when, saladin, attempted, to, usurp, his, dynasty, s, holdings, saif, ad, din, mustered, a, large, army, and, dispatched, it, to, aleppo, whose, defenders, anxiously, had, awaited, them, the, combined, forces, of, mosul, and, aleppo, marched, against, saladin, in, hama, heavily, outnumbered, saladin, initially, attempted, to, make, terms, with, the, zengids, by, abandoning, all, conquests, north, of, the, damascus, province, but, they, refused, insisting, he, return, to, egypt, seeing, that, confrontation, was, unavoidable, saladin, prepared, for, battle, taking, up, a, superior, position, at, the, horns, of, hama, hills, by, the, gorge, of, the, orontes, river, on, 13, april, 1175, the, zengid, troops, marched, to, attack, his, forces, but, soon, found, themselves, surrounded, by, saladin, s, ayyubid, veterans, who, crushed, them, the, battle, ended, in, a, decisive, victory, for, saladin, who, pursued, the, zengid, fugitives, to, the, gates, of, aleppo, forcing, as, salih, s, advisers, to, recognize, saladin, s, control, of, the, provinces, of, damascus, homs, and, hama, as, well, as, a, number, of, towns, outside, aleppo, such, as, ma, arat, al, numan, after, his, victory, against, the, zengids, saladin, proclaimed, himself, king, and, suppressed, the, name, of, as, salih, in, friday, prayers, and, islamic, coinage, from, then, on, he, ordered, prayers, in, all, the, mosques, of, syria, and, egypt, as, the, sovereign, king, and, he, issued, at, the, cairo, mint, gold, coins, bearing, his, official, title, al, malik, an, nasir, yusuf, ayyub, ala, ghaya, the, king, strong, to, aid, joseph, son, of, job, exalted, be, the, standard, the, abbasid, caliph, in, baghdad, graciously, welcomed, saladin, s, assumption, of, power, and, declared, him, sultan, of, egypt, and, syria, the, battle, of, hama, did, not, end, the, contest, for, power, between, the, ayyubids, and, the, zengids, with, the, final, confrontation, occurring, in, the, spring, of, 1176, saladin, had, gathered, massive, reinforcements, from, egypt, while, saif, ad, din, was, levying, troops, among, the, minor, states, of, diyarbakir, and, al, jazira, when, saladin, crossed, the, orontes, leaving, hama, the, sun, was, eclipsed, he, viewed, this, as, an, omen, but, he, continued, his, march, north, he, reached, the, sultan, s, mound, roughly, 25, km, 16, mi, from, aleppo, where, his, forces, encountered, saif, ad, din, s, army, a, hand, to, hand, fight, ensued, and, the, zengids, managed, to, plough, saladin, s, left, wing, driving, it, before, him, when, saladin, himself, charged, at, the, head, of, the, zengid, guard, the, zengid, forces, panicked, and, most, of, saif, ad, din, s, officers, ended, up, being, killed, or, captured, saif, ad, din, narrowly, escaped, the, zengid, army, s, camp, horses, baggage, tents, and, stores, were, seized, by, the, ayyubids, the, zengid, prisoners, of, war, however, were, given, gifts, and, freed, all, of, the, booty, from, the, ayyubid, victory, was, accorded, to, the, army, saladin, not, keeping, anything, himself, he, continued, towards, aleppo, which, still, closed, its, gates, to, him, halting, before, the, city, on, the, way, his, army, took, buza, a, and, then, captured, manbij, from, there, they, headed, west, to, besiege, the, fortress, of, a, zaz, on, 15, may, several, days, later, while, saladin, was, resting, in, one, of, his, captain, s, tents, an, assassin, rushed, forward, at, him, and, struck, at, his, head, with, a, knife, the, cap, of, his, head, armour, was, not, penetrated, and, he, managed, to, grip, the, assassin, s, hand, the, dagger, only, slashing, his, gambeson, and, the, assailant, was, soon, killed, saladin, was, unnerved, at, the, attempt, on, his, life, which, he, accused, gumushtugin, and, the, assassins, of, plotting, and, so, increased, his, efforts, in, the, siege, a, zaz, capitulated, on, 21, june, and, saladin, then, hurried, his, forces, to, aleppo, to, punish, gumushtigin, his, assaults, were, again, resisted, but, he, managed, to, secure, not, only, a, truce, but, a, mutual, alliance, with, aleppo, in, which, gumushtigin, and, as, salih, were, allowed, to, continue, their, hold, on, the, city, and, in, return, they, recognized, saladin, as, the, sovereign, over, all, of, the, dominions, he, conquered, the, emirs, of, mardin, and, keyfa, the, muslim, allies, of, aleppo, also, recognised, saladin, as, the, king, of, syria, when, the, treaty, was, concluded, the, younger, sister, of, as, salih, came, to, saladin, and, requested, the, return, of, the, fortress, of, a, zaz, he, complied, and, escorted, her, back, to, the, gates, of, aleppo, with, numerous, presents, saladin, had, by, now, agreed, to, truces, with, his, zengid, rivals, and, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, the, latter, occurred, in, the, summer, of, 1175, but, faced, a, threat, from, the, isma, ili, sect, known, as, the, assassins, led, by, rashid, ad, din, sinan, based, in, the, an, nusayriyah, mountains, they, commanded, nine, fortresses, all, built, on, high, elevations, as, soon, as, he, dispatched, the, bulk, of, his, troops, to, egypt, saladin, led, his, army, into, the, an, nusayriyah, range, in, august, 1176, he, retreated, the, same, month, after, laying, waste, to, the, countryside, but, failing, to, conquer, any, of, the, forts, most, muslim, historians, claim, that, saladin, s, uncle, the, governor, of, hama, mediated, a, peace, agreement, between, him, and, sinan, saladin, had, his, guards, supplied, with, link, lights, and, had, chalk, and, cinders, strewed, around, his, tent, outside, masyaf, which, he, was, besieging, to, detect, any, footsteps, by, the, assassins, according, to, this, version, one, night, saladin, s, guards, noticed, a, spark, glowing, down, the, hill, of, masyaf, and, then, vanishing, among, the, ayyubid, tents, presently, saladin, awoke, to, find, a, figure, leaving, the, tent, he, saw, that, the, lamps, were, displaced, and, beside, his, bed, laid, hot, scones, of, the, shape, peculiar, to, the, assassins, with, a, note, at, the, top, pinned, by, a, poisoned, dagger, the, note, threatened, that, he, would, be, killed, if, he, did, not, withdraw, from, his, assault, saladin, gave, a, loud, cry, exclaiming, that, sinan, himself, was, the, figure, that, had, left, the, tent, another, version, claims, that, saladin, hastily, withdrew, his, troops, from, masyaf, because, they, were, urgently, needed, to, fend, off, a, crusader, force, in, the, vicinity, of, mount, lebanon, in, reality, saladin, sought, to, form, an, alliance, with, sinan, and, his, assassins, consequently, depriving, the, crusaders, of, a, potent, ally, against, him, viewing, the, expulsion, of, the, crusaders, as, a, mutual, benefit, and, priority, saladin, and, sinan, maintained, cooperative, relations, afterwards, the, latter, dispatching, contingents, of, his, forces, to, bolster, saladin, s, army, in, a, number, of, decisive, subsequent, battlefronts, after, leaving, the, an, nusayriyah, mountains, saladin, returned, to, damascus, and, had, his, syrian, soldiers, return, home, he, left, turan, shah, in, command, of, syria, and, left, for, egypt, with, only, his, personal, followers, reaching, cairo, on, 22, september, having, been, absent, for, roughly, two, years, he, had, much, to, organize, and, supervise, in, egypt, namely, fortifying, and, reconstructing, cairo, the, city, walls, were, repaired, and, their, extensions, laid, out, while, the, construction, of, the, cairo, citadel, was, commenced, the, 280, feet, 85, m, deep, bir, yusuf, joseph, s, well, was, built, on, saladin, s, orders, the, chief, public, work, he, commissioned, outside, of, cairo, was, the, large, bridge, at, giza, which, was, intended, to, form, an, outwork, of, defence, against, a, potential, moorish, invasion, saladin, remained, in, cairo, supervising, its, improvements, building, colleges, such, as, the, madrasa, of, the, sword, makers, and, ordering, the, internal, administration, of, the, country, in, november, 1177, he, set, out, upon, a, raid, into, palestine, the, crusaders, had, recently, forayed, into, the, territory, of, damascus, so, saladin, saw, the, truce, as, no, longer, worth, preserving, the, christians, sent, a, large, portion, of, their, army, to, besiege, the, fortress, of, harim, north, of, aleppo, so, southern, palestine, bore, few, defenders, saladin, found, the, situation, ripe, and, marched, to, ascalon, which, he, referred, to, as, the, bride, of, syria, william, of, tyre, recorded, that, the, ayyubid, army, consisted, of, 26, 000, soldiers, of, which, 8, 000, were, elite, forces, and, 18, 000, were, black, soldiers, from, sudan, this, army, proceeded, to, raid, the, countryside, sack, ramla, and, lod, and, disperse, themselves, as, far, as, the, gates, of, jerusalem, the, ayyubids, allowed, baldwin, iv, of, jerusalem, to, enter, ascalon, with, his, famous, gaza, based, knights, templar, without, taking, any, precautions, against, a, sudden, attack, although, the, crusader, force, consisted, of, only, 375, knights, saladin, hesitated, to, ambush, them, because, of, the, presence, of, highly, skilled, templar, generals, on, 25, november, while, the, greater, part, of, the, ayyubid, army, was, absent, saladin, and, his, men, were, surprised, near, ramla, in, the, battle, of, montgisard, possibly, at, gezer, also, known, as, tell, jezar, before, they, could, form, up, the, templar, force, hacked, the, ayyubid, army, down, by, body, to, body, of, sword, initially, saladin, attempted, to, organize, his, men, into, battle, order, but, as, his, bodyguards, were, being, killed, he, saw, that, defeat, was, inevitable, and, so, with, a, small, remnant, of, his, troops, mounted, a, swift, camel, riding, all, the, way, to, the, territories, of, egypt, not, discouraged, by, his, defeat, at, montgisard, saladin, was, prepared, to, fight, the, crusaders, once, again, in, the, spring, of, 1178, he, was, encamped, under, the, walls, of, homs, and, a, few, skirmishes, occurred, between, his, generals, and, the, crusader, army, his, forces, in, hama, won, a, victory, over, their, enemy, and, brought, the, spoils, together, with, many, prisoners, of, war, to, saladin, who, ordered, the, captives, to, be, beheaded, for, plundering, and, laying, waste, the, lands, of, the, faithful, he, spent, the, rest, of, the, year, in, syria, without, a, confrontation, with, his, enemies, saladin, s, intelligence, services, reported, to, him, that, the, crusaders, were, planning, a, raid, into, syria, he, ordered, one, of, his, generals, farrukh, shah, to, guard, the, damascus, frontier, with, a, thousand, of, his, men, to, watch, for, an, attack, then, to, retire, avoiding, battle, and, to, light, warning, beacons, on, the, hills, after, which, saladin, would, march, out, in, april, 1179, the, crusaders, and, templars, led, by, king, baldwin, expected, no, resistance, and, waited, to, launch, a, surprise, attack, on, muslim, herders, grazing, their, herds, and, flocks, east, of, the, golan, heights, baldwin, advanced, too, rashly, in, pursuit, of, farrukh, shah, s, force, which, was, concentrated, southeast, of, quneitra, and, was, subsequently, defeated, by, the, ayyubids, with, this, victory, saladin, decided, to, call, in, more, troops, from, egypt, he, requested, al, adil, to, dispatch, 1, 500, horsemen, in, the, summer, of, 1179, king, baldwin, had, set, up, an, outpost, on, the, road, to, damascus, and, aimed, to, fortify, a, passage, over, the, jordan, river, known, as, jacob, s, ford, that, commanded, the, approach, to, the, banias, plain, the, plain, was, divided, by, the, muslims, and, the, christians, saladin, had, offered, 100, 000, gold, pieces, to, baldwin, to, abandon, the, project, which, was, particularly, offensive, to, the, muslims, but, to, no, avail, he, then, resolved, to, destroy, the, fortress, called, chastellet, and, defended, by, the, templars, knights, moving, his, headquarters, to, banias, as, the, crusaders, hurried, down, to, attack, the, muslim, forces, they, fell, into, disorder, with, the, infantry, falling, behind, despite, early, success, they, pursued, the, muslims, far, enough, to, become, scattered, and, saladin, took, advantage, by, rallying, his, troops, and, charging, at, the, crusaders, the, engagement, ended, in, a, decisive, ayyubid, victory, and, many, high, ranking, knights, were, captured, saladin, then, moved, to, besiege, the, fortress, which, fell, on, 30, august, 1179, in, the, spring, of, 1180, while, saladin, was, in, the, area, of, safad, anxious, to, commence, a, vigorous, campaign, against, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, king, baldwin, sent, messengers, to, him, with, proposals, of, peace, because, droughts, and, bad, harvests, hampered, his, commissariat, saladin, agreed, to, a, truce, raymond, of, tripoli, denounced, the, truce, but, was, compelled, to, accept, after, an, ayyubid, raid, on, his, territory, in, may, and, upon, the, appearance, of, saladin, s, naval, fleet, off, the, port, of, tartus, in, june, 1180, saladin, hosted, a, reception, for, nur, ad, din, muhammad, the, artuqid, emir, of, keyfa, at, geuk, su, in, which, he, presented, him, and, his, brother, abu, bakr, with, gifts, valued, at, over, 100, 000, dinars, according, to, imad, ad, din, this, was, intended, to, cement, an, alliance, with, the, artuqids, and, to, impress, other, emirs, in, mesopotamia, and, anatolia, previously, saladin, offered, to, mediate, relations, between, nur, ad, din, and, kilij, arslan, ii, the, seljuk, sultan, of, r, m, after, the, two, came, into, conflict, the, latter, demanded, that, nur, ad, din, return, the, lands, given, to, him, as, a, dowry, for, marrying, his, daughter, when, he, received, reports, that, she, was, being, abused, and, used, to, gain, seljuk, territory, nur, ad, din, asked, saladin, to, mediate, the, issue, but, arslan, refused, after, nur, ad, din, and, saladin, met, at, geuk, su, the, top, seljuk, emir, ikhtiyar, ad, din, al, hasan, confirmed, arslan, s, submission, after, which, an, agreement, was, drawn, up, saladin, was, later, enraged, when, he, received, a, message, from, arslan, accusing, nur, ad, din, of, more, abuses, against, his, daughter, he, threatened, to, attack, the, city, of, malatya, saying, it, is, two, days, march, for, me, and, i, shall, not, dismount, until, i, am, in, the, city, alarmed, at, the, threat, the, seljuks, pushed, for, negotiations, saladin, felt, that, arslan, was, correct, to, care, for, his, daughter, but, nur, ad, din, had, taken, refuge, with, him, and, therefore, he, could, not, betray, his, trust, it, was, finally, agreed, that, arslan, s, daughter, would, be, sent, away, for, a, year, and, if, nur, ad, din, failed, to, comply, saladin, would, move, to, abandon, his, support, for, him, leaving, farrukh, shah, in, charge, of, syria, saladin, returned, to, cairo, at, the, beginning, of, 1181, according, to, abu, shama, he, intended, to, spend, the, fast, of, ramadan, in, egypt, and, then, make, the, hajj, pilgrimage, to, mecca, in, the, summer, for, an, unknown, reason, he, apparently, changed, his, plans, regarding, the, pilgrimage, and, was, seen, inspecting, the, nile, river, banks, in, june, he, was, again, embroiled, with, the, bedouin, he, removed, two, thirds, of, their, fiefs, to, use, as, compensation, for, the, fief, holders, at, fayyum, the, bedouin, were, also, accused, of, trading, with, the, crusaders, and, consequently, their, grain, was, confiscated, and, they, were, forced, to, migrate, westward, later, ayyubid, warships, were, deployed, against, bedouin, river, pirates, who, were, plundering, the, shores, of, lake, tanis, in, the, summer, of, 1181, saladin, s, former,

din, al, ishfahani, at, his, estate, in, cairo, saladin, s, intimates, accused, majd, ad, din, of, misappropriating, the, revenues, of, zabid, but, saladin, himself, believed, there, was, no, evidence, to, back, the, allegations, he, had, majd, ad, din, released, in, return, for, a, payment, of, 80, 000, dinars, in, addition, other, sums, were, to, be, paid, to, saladin, s, brothers, al, adil, and, taj, al, muluk, buri, the, controversial, detainment, of, majd, ad, din, was, a, part, of, the, larger, discontent, associated, with, the, aftermath, of, turan, shah, s, departure, from, yemen, although, his, deputies, continued, to, send, him, revenues, from, the, province, centralized, authority, was, lacking, and, an, internal, quarrel, arose, between, izz, ad, din, uthman, of, aden, and, hittan, of, zabid, saladin, wrote, in, a, letter, to, al, adil, this, yemen, is, a, treasure, house, we, conquered, it, but, up, to, this, day, we, have, had, no, return, and, no, advantage, from, it, there, have, been, only, innumerable, expenses, the, sending, out, of, troops, and, expectations, which, did, not, produce, what, was, hoped, for, in, the, end, saif, ad, din, had, died, earlier, in, june, 1181, and, his, brother, izz, ad, din, inherited, leadership, of, mosul, on, 4, december, the, crown, prince, of, the, zengids, as, salih, died, in, aleppo, prior, to,

aleppo, but, possessing, it, and, mosul, put, too, great, of, a, strain, on, his, abilities, he, thus, handed, aleppo, to, his, brother, imad, ad, din, zangi, in, exchange, for, sinjar, saladin, offered, no, opposition, to, these, transactions, in, order, to, respect, the, treaty, he, previously, made, with, the, zengids, on, 11, may, 1182, saladin, along, with, half, of, the, egyptian,

to, destroy, the, christian, army, and, could, not, logistically, sustain, his, own, army, any, longer, so, he, withdrew, across, the, river, in, august, he, passed, through, the, beqaa, valley, to, beirut, where, he, rendezvoused, with, the, egyptian, fleet, and, laid, siege, to, the, city, failing, to, make, any, headway, he, withdrew, after, a, few, days, to, deal, with, matters, in,

size, of, saladin, s, army, he, made, little, effort, to, resist, and, surrendered, on, the, condition, that, he, would, retain, his, property, saladin, promptly, impressed, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, by, publishing, a, decree, that, ordered, a, number, of, taxes, to, be, canceled, and, erased, all, mention, of, them, from, treasury, records, stating, the, most, miserable, rulers, are, those,

saladin, proceeded, to, take, nusaybin, which, offered, no, resistance, a, medium, sized, town, nusaybin, was, not, of, great, importance, but, it, was, located, in, a, strategic, position, between, mardin, and, mosul, and, within, easy, reach, of, diyarbakir, in, the, midst, of, these, victories, saladin, received, word, that, the, crusaders, were, raiding, the, villages, of, damascus, he, replied, let, them, whilst, they, knock, down, villages, we, are, taking, cities, when, we, come, back, we, shall, have, all, the, more, strength, to, fight, them, meanwhile, in, aleppo, the, emir, of, the, city, zangi, raided, saladin, s, cities, to, the, north, and, east, such, as, balis, manbij, saruj, buza, a, al, karzain, he, also, destroyed, his, own, citadel, at, a, zaz, to, prevent, it, from, being, used, by, the, ayyubids, if, they, were, to, conquer, it, as, saladin, approached, mosul, he, faced, the, issue, of, taking, over, a, large, city, and, justifying, the, action, the, zengids, of, mosul, appealed, to, an, nasir, the, abbasid, caliph, at, baghdad, whose, vizier, favored, them, an, nasir, sent, badr, al, badr, a, high, ranking, religious, figure, to, mediate, between, the, two, sides, saladin, arrived, at, the, city, on, 10, november, 1182, izz, ad, din, would, not, accept, his, terms, because, he, considered, them, disingenuous, and, extensive, and, saladin, immediately, laid, siege, to, the, heavily, fortified, city, after, several, minor, skirmishes, and, a, stalemate, in, the, siege, that, was, initiated, by, the, caliph, saladin, intended, to, find, a, way, to, withdraw, without, damage, to, his, reputation, while, still, keeping, up, some, military, pressure, he, decided, to, attack, sinjar, which, was, held, by, izz, ad, din, s, brother, sharaf, ad, din, it, fell, after, a, 15, day, siege, on, 30, december, saladin, s, soldiers, broke, their, discipline, plundering, the, city, saladin, managed, to, protect, the, governor, and, his, officers, only, by, sending, them, to, mosul, after, establishing, a, garrison, at, sinjar, he, awaited, a, coalition, assembled, by, izz, ad, din, consisting, of, his, forces, those, from, aleppo, mardin, and, armenia, saladin, and, his, army, met, the, coalition, at, harran, in, february, 1183, but, on, hearing, of, his, approach, the, latter, sent, messengers, to, saladin, asking, for, peace, each, force, returned, to, their, cities, and, al, fadil, wrote, they, advanced, like, men, like, women, they, vanished, on, 2, march, al, adil, from, egypt, wrote, to, saladin, that, the, crusaders, had, struck, the, heart, of, islam, raynald, de, ch, tillon, had, sent, ships, to, the, gulf, of, aqaba, to, raid, towns, and, villages, off, the, coast, of, the, red, sea, it, was, not, an, attempt, to, extend, the, crusader, influence, into, that, sea, or, to, capture, its, trade, routes, but, merely, a, piratical, move, nonetheless, imad, ad, din, writes, the, raid, was, alarming, to, the, muslims, because, they, were, not, accustomed, to, attacks, on, that, sea, and, ibn, al, athir, adds, that, the, inhabitants, had, no, experience, with, the, crusaders, either, as, fighters, or, traders, ibn, jubair, was, told, that, sixteen, muslim, ships, were, burnt, by, the, crusaders, who, then, captured, a, pilgrim, ship, and, caravan, at, aidab, he, also, reported, that, they, intended, to, attack, medina, and, remove, muhammad, s, body, al, maqrizi, added, to, the, rumor, by, claiming, muhammad, s, tomb, was, going, to, be, relocated, to, crusader, territory, so, muslims, would, make, pilgrimages, there, al, adil, had, his, warships, moved, from, fustat, and, alexandria, to, the, red, sea, under, the, command, of, an, armenian, mercenary, lu, lu, they, broke, the, crusader, blockade, destroyed, most, of, their, ships, and, pursued, and, captured, those, who, anchored, and, fled, into, the, desert, the, surviving, crusaders, numbered, at, 170, were, ordered, to, be, killed, by, saladin, in, various, muslim, cities, from, the, point, of, view, of, saladin, in, terms, of, territory, the, war, against, mosul, was, going, well, but, he, still, failed, to, achieve, his, objectives, and, his, army, was, shrinking, taqi, ad, din, took, his, men, back, to, hama, while, nasir, ad, din, muhammad, and, his, forces, had, left, this, encouraged, izz, ad, din, and, his, allies, to, take, the, offensive, the, previous, coalition, regrouped, at, harzam, some, 140, km, from, harran, in, early, april, without, waiting, for, nasir, ad, din, saladin, and, taqi, ad, din, commenced, their, advance, against, the, coalition, marching, eastward, to, ras, al, ein, unhindered, by, late, april, after, three, days, of, actual, fighting, according, to, saladin, the, ayyubids, had, captured, amid, he, handed, the, city, to, nur, ad, din, muhammad, together, with, its, stores, which, consisted, of, 80, 000, candles, a, tower, full, of, arrowheads, and, 1, 040, 000, books, in, return, for, a, diploma, granting, him, the, city, nur, ad, din, swore, allegiance, to, saladin, promising, to, follow, him, in, every, expedition, in, the, war, against, the, crusaders, and, repairing, the, damage, done, to, the, city, the, fall, of, amid, in, addition, to, territory, convinced, il, ghazi, of, mardin, to, enter, the, service, of, saladin, weakening, izz, ad, din, s, coalition, saladin, attempted, to, gain, the, caliph, an, nasir, s, support, against, izz, ad, din, by, sending, him, a, letter, requesting, a, document, that, would, give, him, legal, justification, for, taking, over, mosul, and, its, territories, saladin, aimed, to, persuade, the, caliph, claiming, that, while, he, conquered, egypt, and, yemen, under, the, flag, of, the, abbasids, the, zengids, of, mosul, openly, supported, the, seljuks, rivals, of, the, caliphate, and, only, came, to, the, caliph, when, in, need, he, also, accused, izz, ad, din, s, forces, of, disrupting, the, muslim, holy, war, against, the, crusaders, stating, they, are, not, content, not, to, fight, but, they, prevent, those, who, can, saladin, defended, his, own, conduct, claiming, that, he, had, come, to, syria, to, fight, the, crusaders, end, the, heresy, of, the, assassins, and, stop, the, wrong, doing, of, the, muslims, he, also, promised, that, if, mosul, was, given, to, him, it, would, lead, to, the, capture, of, jerusalem, constantinople, georgia, and, the, lands, of, the, almohads, in, the, maghreb, until, the, word, of, god, is, supreme, and, the, abbasid, caliphate, has, wiped, the, world, clean, turning, the, churches, into, mosques, saladin, stressed, that, all, this, would, happen, by, the, will, of, god, and, instead, of, asking, for, financial, or, military, support, from, the, caliph, he, would, capture, and, give, the, caliph, the, territories, of, tikrit, daquq, khuzestan, kish, island, and, oman, saladin, turned, his, attention, from, mosul, to, aleppo, sending, his, brother, taj, al, muluk, buri, to, capture, tell, khalid, 130, km, northeast, of, the, city, a, siege, was, set, but, the, governor, of, tell, khalid, surrendered, upon, the, arrival, of, saladin, himself, on, 17, may, before, a, siege, could, take, place, according, to, imad, ad, din, after, tell, khalid, saladin, took, a, detour, northwards, to, aintab, but, he, gained, possession, of, it, when, his, army, turned, towards, it, allowing, him, to, quickly, move, backward, another, c, 100, km, towards, aleppo, on, 21, may, he, camped, outside, the, city, positioning, himself, east, of, the, citadel, of, aleppo, while, his, forces, encircled, the, suburb, of, banaqusa, to, the, northeast, and, bab, janan, to, the, west, he, stationed, his, men, dangerously, close, to, the, city, hoping, for, an, early, success, zangi, did, not, offer, long, resistance, he, was, unpopular, with, his, subjects, and, wished, to, return, to, his, sinjar, the, city, he, governed, previously, an, exchange, was, negotiated, where, zangi, would, hand, over, aleppo, to, saladin, in, return, for, the, restoration, of, his, control, of, sinjar, nusaybin, and, raqqa, zangi, would, hold, these, territories, as, saladin, s, vassals, in, terms, of, military, service, on, 12, june, aleppo, was, formally, placed, in, ayyubid, hands, the, people, of, aleppo, had, not, known, about, these, negotiations, and, were, taken, by, surprise, when, saladin, s, standard, was, hoisted, over, the, citadel, two, emir, s, including, an, old, friend, of, saladin, izz, ad, din, jurduk, welcomed, and, pledged, their, service, to, him, saladin, replaced, the, hanafi, courts, with, shafi, i, administration, despite, a, promise, that, he, would, not, interfere, in, the, religious, leadership, of, the, city, although, he, was, short, of, money, saladin, also, allowed, the, departing, zangi, to, take, all, the, stores, of, the, citadel, that, he, could, travel, with, and, to, sell, the, remainder, which, saladin, purchased, himself, in, spite, of, his, earlier, hesitation, to, go, through, with, the, exchange, he, had, no, doubts, about, his, success, stating, that, aleppo, was, the, key, to, the, lands, and, this, city, is, the, eye, of, syria, and, the, citadel, is, its, pupil, for, saladin, the, capture, of, the, city, marked, the, end, of, over, eight, years, of, waiting, since, he, told, farrukh, shah, that, we, have, only, to, do, the, milking, and, aleppo, will, be, ours, after, spending, one, night, in, aleppo, s, citadel, saladin, marched, to, harim, near, the, crusader, held, antioch, the, city, was, held, by, surhak, a, minor, mamluk, saladin, offered, him, the, city, of, busra, and, property, in, damascus, in, exchange, for, harim, but, when, surhak, asked, for, more, his, own, garrison, in, harim, forced, him, out, he, was, arrested, by, saladin, s, deputy, taqi, ad, din, on, allegations, that, he, was, planning, to, cede, harim, to, bohemond, iii, of, antioch, when, saladin, received, its, surrender, he, proceeded, to, arrange, the, defense, of, harim, from, the, crusaders, he, reported, to, the, caliph, and, his, own, subordinates, in, yemen, and, baalbek, that, he, was, going, to, attack, the, armenians, before, he, could, move, however, there, were, a, number, of, administrative, details, to, be, settled, saladin, agreed, to, a, truce, with, bohemond, in, return, for, muslim, prisoners, being, held, by, him, and, then, he, gave, a, zaz, to, alam, ad, din, suleiman, and, aleppo, to, saif, ad, din, al, yazkuj, the, former, was, an, emir, of, aleppo, who, joined, saladin, and, the, latter, was, a, former, mamluk, of, shirkuh, who, helped, rescue, him, from, the, assassination, attempt, at, a, zaz, crusader, attacks, provoked, further, responses, by, saladin, raynald, of, ch, tillon, in, particular, harassed, muslim, trading, and, pilgrimage, routes, with, a, fleet, on, the, red, sea, a, water, route, that, saladin, needed, to, keep, open, raynald, threatened, to, attack, the, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, on, 29, september, 1183, saladin, crossed, the, jordan, river, to, attack, beisan, which, was, found, to, be, empty, the, next, day, his, forces, sacked, and, burned, the, town, and, moved, westwards, they, intercepted, crusader, reinforcements, from, karak, and, shaubak, along, the, nablus, road, and, took, prisoners, meanwhile, the, main, crusader, force, under, guy, of, lusignan, moved, from, sepphoris, to, al, fula, saladin, sent, out, 500, skirmishers, to, harass, their, forces, and, he, himself, marched, to, ain, jalut, when, the, crusader, force, reckoned, to, be, the, largest, the, kingdom, ever, produced, from, its, own, resources, but, still, outmatched, by, the, muslims, advanced, the, ayyubids, unexpectedly, moved, down, the, stream, of, ain, jalut, after, a, few, ayyubid, raids, including, attacks, on, zir, in, forbelet, and, mount, tabor, the, crusaders, still, were, not, tempted, to, attack, their, main, force, and, saladin, led, his, men, back, across, the, river, once, provisions, and, supplies, ran, low, saladin, still, had, to, exact, retribution, on, raynald, so, he, twice, besieged, kerak, raynald, s, fortress, in, oultrejordain, the, first, time, was, in, 1183, following, his, unsuccessful, campaign, into, galilee, but, a, relief, force, caused, him, to, withdraw, he, opened, his, campaign, of, 1184, with, a, second, siege, of, kerak, hoping, this, time, to, draw, the, crusader, army, into, battle, on, open, ground, but, they, outmaneuvered, him, and, successfully, relieved, the, fortress, following, the, failure, of, his, kerak, sieges, saladin, temporarily, turned, his, attention, back, to, another, long, term, project, and, resumed, attacks, on, the, territory, of, izz, ad, din, mas, ud, ibn, mawdud, ibn, zangi, around, mosul, which, he, had, begun, with, some, success, in, 1182, however, since, then, mas, d, had, allied, himself, with, the, powerful, governor, of, azerbaijan, and, jibal, who, in, 1185, began, moving, his, troops, across, the, zagros, mountains, causing, saladin, to, hesitate, in, his, attacks, the, defenders, of, mosul, when, they, became, aware, that, help, was, on, the, way, increased, their, efforts, and, saladin, subsequently, fell, ill, so, in, march, 1186, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, meanwhile, raynald, retaliated, for, the, earlier, sieges, of, kerak, by, looting, a, caravan, of, pilgrims, on, the, hajj, during, the, winter, of, 1186, 87, according, to, the, later, 13th, century, old, french, continuation, of, william, of, tyre, raynald, captured, saladin, s, sister, in, a, raid, on, a, caravan, this, claim, is, not, attested, in, contemporary, sources, muslim, or, frankish, however, instead, stating, that, raynald, had, attacked, a, preceding, caravan, and, saladin, set, guards, to, ensure, the, safety, of, his, sister, and, her, son, who, came, to, no, harm, on, hearing, of, the, attack, saladin, vowed, that, he, would, personally, slay, raynald, for, breaking, the, truce, a, vow, he, would, keep, the, outrage, also, led, saladin, to, resolve, to, dispense, with, half, measures, to, rein, in, the, unruly, lord, of, kerak, and, to, instead, topple, the, entire, edifice, of, the, christian, kingdom, of, jerusalem, thus, precipitating, the, invasion, of, the, summer, of, 1187, on, 4, july, 1187, saladin, faced, the, combined, forces, of, guy, of, lusignan, king, consort, of, jerusalem, and, raymond, iii, of, tripoli, at, the, battle, of, hattin, in, this, battle, alone, the, crusader, force, was, largely, annihilated, by, saladin, s, determined, army, it, was, a, major, disaster, for, the, crusaders, and, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, the, crusades, saladin, captured, raynald, and, was, personally, responsible, for, his, execution, in, retaliation, for, his, attacks, against, muslim, caravans, the, members, of, these, caravans, had, in, vain, besought, his, mercy, by, reciting, the, truce, between, the, muslims, and, the, crusaders, but, raynald, ignored, this, and, insulted, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, before, murdering, and, torturing, some, of, them, upon, hearing, this, saladin, swore, an, oath, to, personally, execute, raynald, guy, of, lusignan, was, also, captured, seeing, the, execution, of, raynald, he, feared, he, would, be, next, however, his, life, was, spared, by, saladin, who, said, of, raynald, t, is, not, the, wont, of, kings, to, kill, kings, but, that, man, had, transgressed, all, bounds, and, therefore, did, i, treat, him, thus, saladin, had, captured, almost, every, crusader, city, saladin, preferred, to, take, jerusalem, without, bloodshed, and, offered, generous, terms, but, those, inside, refused, to, leave, their, holy, city, vowing, to, destroy, it, in, a, fight, to, the, death, rather, than, see, it, handed, over, peacefully, jerusalem, capitulated, to, his, forces, on, friday, 2, october, 1187, after, a, siege, when, the, siege, had, started, saladin, was, unwilling, to, promise, terms, of, quarter, to, the, frankish, inhabitants, of, jerusalem, balian, of, ibelin, threatened, to, kill, every, muslim, hostage, estimated, at, 5, 000, and, to, destroy, islam, s, holy, shrines, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, the, al, aqsa, mosque, if, such, quarter, were, not, provided, saladin, consulted, his, council, and, the, terms, were, accepted, the, agreement, was, read, out, through, the, streets, of, jerusalem, so, that, everyone, might, within, forty, days, provide, for, himself, and, pay, to, saladin, the, agreed, tribute, for, his, freedom, an, unusually, low, ransom, was, to, be, paid, for, each, frank, in, the, city, whether, man, woman, or, child, but, saladin, against, the, wishes, of, his, treasurers, allowed, many, families, who, could, not, afford, the, ransom, to, leave, patriarch, heraclius, of, jerusalem, organised, and, contributed, to, a, collection, that, paid, the, ransoms, for, about, 18, 000, of, the, poorer, citizens, leaving, another, 15, 000, to, be, enslaved, saladin, s, brother, al, adil, asked, saladin, for, a, thousand, of, them, for, his, own, use, and, then, released, them, on, the, spot, most, of, the, foot, soldiers, were, sold, into, slavery, upon, the, capture, of, jerusalem, saladin, summoned, the, jews, and, permitted, them, to, resettle, in, the, city, in, particular, the, residents, of, ascalon, a, large, jewish, settlement, responded, to, his, request, tyre, on, the, coast, of, modern, day, lebanon, was, the, last, major, crusader, city, that, was, not, captured, by, muslim, forces, strategically, it, would, have, made, more, sense, for, saladin, to, capture, tyre, before, jerusalem, saladin, however, chose, to, pursue, jerusalem, first, because, of, the, importance, of, the, city, to, islam, tyre, was, commanded, by, conrad, of, montferrat, who, strengthened, its, defences, and, withstood, two, sieges, by, saladin, in, 1188, at, tortosa, saladin, released, guy, of, lusignan, and, returned, him, to, his, wife, sibylla, of, jerusalem, they, went, first, to, tripoli, then, to, antioch, in, 1189, they, sought, to, reclaim, tyre, for, their, kingdom, but, were, refused, admission, by, conrad, who, did, not, recognize, guy, as, king, guy, then, set, about, besieging, acre, saladin, was, on, friendly, terms, with, queen, tamar, of, georgia, saladin, s, biographer, baha, ad, din, ibn, shaddad, reports, that, after, saladin, s, conquest, of, jerusalem, the, georgian, queen, sent, envoys, to, the, sultan, to, request, the, return, of, confiscated, possessions, of, the, georgian, monasteries, in, jerusalem, saladin, s, response, is, not, recorded, but, the, queen, s, efforts, seem, to, have, been, successful, as, jacques, de, vitry, the, bishop, of, acre, reports, the, georgians, were, in, contrast, to, the, other, christian, pilgrims, allowed, a, free, passage, into, the, city, with, their, banners, unfurled, ibn, add, d, furthermore, claims, that, queen, tamar, outbid, the, byzantine, emperor, in, her, efforts, to, obtain, the, relics, of, the, true, cross, offering, 200, 000, gold, pieces, to, saladin, who, had, taken, the, relics, as, booty, at, the, battle, of, hattin, but, to, no, avail, according, to, baha, ad, din, after, these, victories, saladin, mused, of, invading, europe, saying, i, think, that, when, god, grants, me, victory, over, the, rest, of, palestine, i, shall, divide, my, territories, make, a, will, stating, my, wishes, then, set, sail, on, this, sea, for, their, far, off, lands, in, and, pursue, the, franks, there, so, as, to, free, the, earth, of, anyone, who, does, not, believe, in, god, or, die, in, the, attempt, it, is, equally, true, that, his, generosity, his, piety, devoid, of, fanaticism, that, flower, of, liberality, and, courtesy, which, had, been, the, model, of, our, old, chroniclers, won, him, no, less, popularity, in, frankish, syria, than, in, the, lands, of, islam, ren, grousset, writer, hattin, and, the, fall, of, jerusalem, prompted, the, third, crusade, 1189, 1192, which, was, partially, financed, by, a, special, saladin, tithe, in, 1188, king, richard, i, led, guy, s, siege, of, acre, conquered, the, city, and, executed, almost, 3, 000, muslim, prisoners, of, war, baha, ad, din, wrote, the, motives, of, this, massacre, are, differently, told, according, to, some, the, captives, were, slain, by, way, of, reprisal, for, the, death, of, those, christians, whom, the, musulmans, had, slain, others, again, say, that, the, king, of, england, on, deciding, to, attempt, the, conquest, of, ascalon, thought, it, unwise, to, leave, so, many, prisoners, in, the, town, after, his, departure, god, alone, knows, what, the, real, reason, was, the, armies, of, saladin, engaged, in, combat, with, the, army, of, king, richard, at, the, battle, of, arsuf, on, 7, september, 1191, at, which, saladin, s, forces, suffered, heavy, losses, and, were, forced, to, withdraw, after, the, battle, of, arsuf, richard, occupied, jaffa, restoring, the, city, s, fortifications, meanwhile, saladin, moved, south, where, he, dismantled, the, fortifications, of, ascalon, to, prevent, this, strategically, important, city, which, lay, at, the, junction, between, egypt, and, palestine, from, falling, into, crusader, hands, in, october, 1191, richard, began, restoring, the, inland, castles, on, the, coastal, plain, beyond, jaffa, in, preparation, for, an, advance, on, jerusalem, during, this, period, richard, and, saladin, passed, envoys, back, and, forth, negotiating, the, possibility, of, a, truce, richard, proposed, that, his, sister, joan, should, marry, saladin, s, brother, and, that, jerusalem, could, be, their, wedding, gift, however, saladin, rejected, this, idea, when, richard, insisted, that, saladin, s, brother, convert, to, christianity, richard, suggested, that, his, niece, eleanor, fair, maid, of, brittany, be, the, bride, instead, an, idea, that, saladin, also, rejected, in, january, 1192, richard, s, army, occupied, beit, nuba, just, twelve, miles, from, jerusalem, but, withdrew, without, attacking, the, holy, city, instead, richard, advanced, south, on, ascalon, where, he, restored, the, fortifications, in, july, 1192, saladin, tried, to, threaten, richard, s, command, of, the, coast, by, attacking, jaffa, the, city, was, besieged, and, saladin, very, nearly, captured, it, however, richard, arrived, a, few, days, later, and, defeated, saladin, s, army, in, a, battle, outside, the, city, the, battle, of, jaffa, 1192, proved, to, be, the, last, military, engagement, of, the, third, crusade, after, richard, reoccupied, jaffa, and, restored, its, fortifications, he, and, saladin, again, discussed, terms, at, last, richard, agreed, to, demolish, the, fortifications, of, ascalon, while, saladin, agreed, to, recognize, crusader, control, of, the, palestinian, coast, from, tyre, to, jaffa, the, christians, would, be, allowed, to, travel, as, unarmed, pilgrims, to, jerusalem, and, saladin, s, kingdom, would, be, at, peace, with, the, crusader, states, for, the, following, three, years, saladin, died, of, a, fever, on, 4, march, 1193, 27, safar, 589, ah, at, damascus, not, long, after, king, richard, s, departure, in, saladin, s, possession, at, the, time, of, his, death, were, one, piece, of, gold, and, forty, pieces, of, silver, he, had, given, away, his, great, wealth, to, his, poor, subjects, leaving, nothing, to, pay, for, his, funeral, he, was, buried, in, a, mausoleum, in, the, garden, outside, the, umayyad, mosque, in, damascus, syria, originally, the, tomb, was, part, of, a, complex, which, also, included, a, school, madrassah, al, aziziah, of, which, little, remains, except, a, few, columns, and, an, internal, arch, seven, centuries, later, emperor, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, donated, a, new, marble, sarcophagus, to, the, mausoleum, however, the, original, sarcophagus, was, not, replaced, instead, the, mausoleum, which, is, open, to, visitors, now, has, two,

one, created, by, walter, scott, and, other, europeans, in, the, west, at, the, time, saladin, s, reputation, had, previously, been, largely, forgotten, in, the, muslim, world, eclipsed, by, more, successful, figures, such, as, baybars, of, egypt, modern, arab, states, have, sought, to, commemorate, saladin, through, various, measures, often, based, on, the, image, created, of, him, in, the, 19th, century, west, a, governorate, centered, around, tikrit, and, samarra, in, modern, day, iraq, is, named, after, him, as, is, salahaddin, university, in, erbil, the, largest, city, of, iraqi,

the, citadel, of, cairo, 1175, 1183, which, had, been, a, domed, pleasure, pavilion, with, a, fine, view, in, more, peaceful, times, in, syria, even, the, smallest, city, is, centred, on, a, defensible, citadel, and, saladin, introduced, this, essential, feature, to, egypt, although, the, ayyubid, dynasty, that, he, founded, would, outlive, him, by, only, 57, years, the, legacy, of, saladin, within, the, arab, world, continues, to, this, day, with, the, rise, of, arab, nationalism, in, the, 20th, century, particularly, with, regard, to, the, arab, israeli, conflict, saladin, s, heroism, and, leadership, gained, a, new, significance, saladin, s, recapture, of, palestine, from, the, european, crusaders, is, considered, an, inspiration, for, modern, day, arabs, opposition, to, zionism, moreover, the, glory, and, comparative, unity, of, the, arab, world, under, saladin, was, seen, as, the, perfect, symbol, for, the, new, unity, sought, by, arab, nationalists, such, as, gamal, abdel, nasser, for, this, reason, the, eagle, of, saladin, became, the, symbol, of, revolutionary, egypt, and, was, subsequently, adopted, by, several, other, arab, states, the, united, arab, republic, iraq, libya, the, state, of, palestine, and, yemen, among, egyptian, shias, saladin, is, dubbed, as, kharab, ad, din, the, destroyer, of, religion, a, derisive, play, on, the, name, saladin, saladin, was, widely, renowned, in, medieval, europe, as, a, model, of, kingship, and, in, particular, of, the, courtly, virtue, of, regal, generosity, as, early, as, 1202, 03, walther, von, der, vogelweide, urged, the, german, king, philip, of, swabia, to, be, more, like, saladin, who, believed, that, a, king, s, hands, should, have, holes, to, let, the, gold, fall, through, by, the, 1270s, jans, der, enikel, was, spreading, the, fictitious, but, approving, story, of, saladin, s, table, which, presented, him, as, both, pious, and, wise, to, religious, diversity, in, the, divine, comedy, 1308, 1320, dante, mentions, him, as, one, of, the, virtuous, non, christians, in, limbo, and, he, is, also, depicted, favorably, in, boccaccio, s, the, decameron, 1438, 53, although, saladin, faded, into, history, after, the, middle, ages, he, appears, in, a, sympathetic, light, in, modern, literature, first, in, lessing, s, play, nathan, the, wise, 1779, which, transfers, the, central, idea, of, saladin, s, table, to, the, post, medieval, world, he, is, a, central, character, in, sir, walter, scott, s, novel, the, talisman, 1825, which, more, than, any, other, single, text, influenced, the, romantic, view, of, saladin, scott, presented, saladin, as, a, modern, liberal, european, gentlemen, beside, whom, medieval, westerners, would, always, have, made, a, poor, showing, 20th, century, french, author, albert, champdor, described, him, as, le, plus, pur, h, ros, de, l, islam, english, the, purest, hero, of, islam, despite, the, crusaders, slaughter, when, they, originally, conquered, jerusalem, in, 1099, saladin, granted, amnesty, and, free, passage, to, all, common, catholics, and, even, to, the, defeated, christian, army, as, long, as, they, were, able, to, pay, the, aforementioned, ransom, the, greek, orthodox, christians, were, treated, even, better, because, they, often, opposed, the, western, crusaders, notwithstanding, the, differences, in, beliefs, the, muslim, saladin, was, respected, by, christian, lords, richard, especially, richard, once, praised, saladin, as, a, great, prince, saying, that, he, was, without, doubt, the, greatest, and, most, powerful, leader, in, the, islamic, world, saladin, in, turn, stated, that, there, was, not, a, more, honorable, christian, lord, than, richard, after, the, treaty, saladin, and, richard, sent, each, other, many, gifts, as, tokens, of, respect, but, never, met, face, to, face, in, april, 1191, a, frankish, woman, s, three, month, old, baby, had, been, stolen, from, her, camp, and, sold, on, the, market, the, franks, urged, her, to, approach, saladin, herself, with, her, grievance, according, to, ibn, shaddad, saladin, used, his, own, money, to, buy, the, child, back, he, gave, it, to, the, mother, and, she, took, it, with, tears, streaming, down, her, face, and, hugged, the, baby, to, her, chest, the, people, were, watching, her, and, weeping, and, i, ibn, shaddad, was, standing, amongst, them, she, suckled, it, for, some, time, and, then, saladin, ordered, a, horse, to, be, fetched, for, her, and, she, went, back, to, camp, mark, cartwright, the, publishing, director, of, world, history, encyclopedia, writes, indeed, it, is, somewhat, ironic, that, the, muslim, leader, became, one, of, the, great, exemplars, of, chivalry, in, 13th, century, european, literature, much, has, been, written, about, the, sultan, during, his, own, lifetime, and, since, but, the, fact, that, an, appreciation, for, his, diplomacy, and, leadership, skills, can, be, found, in, both, contemporary, muslim, and, christian, sources, would, suggest, that, saladin, is, indeed, worthy, of, his, position, as, one, of, the, great, medieval, leaders
