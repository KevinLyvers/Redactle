brother, alfonso, were, left, in, king, henry, s, care, isabella, her, mother, and, alfonso, then, moved, to, ar, valo, these, were, times, of, turmoil, for, isabella, the, living, conditions, at, their, castle, in, ar, valo, were, poor, and, they, suffered, from, a, shortage, of, money, although, her, father, arranged, in, his, will, for, his, children, to, be, financially, well, taken, care, of, king, henry, did, not, comply, with, their, father, s, wishes, either, from, a, desire, to, keep, his, half, siblings, restricted, or, from, ineptitude, even, though, her, living, conditions, were, difficult, isabella, was, instructed, in, lessons, of, practical, piety, and, in, a, deep, reverence, for, religion, under, the, supervision, of, her, mother, when, the, king, s, wife, joan, of, portugal, was, about, to, give, birth, to, their, daughter, joanna, isabella, and, her, brother, alfonso, were, summoned, to, court, in, segovia, to, come, under, the, direct, supervision, of, the, king, and, to, finish, their, education, alfonso, was, placed, in, the, care, of, a, tutor, while, isabella, became, part, of, the, queen, s, household, some, of, isabella, s, living, conditions, improved, in, segovia, she, always, had, food, and, clothing, and, lived, in, a, castle, that, was, adorned, with, gold, and, silver, isabella, s, basic, education, consisted, of, reading, spelling,

music, she, lived, a, relaxed, lifestyle, but, she, rarely, left, segovia, since, king, henry, forbade, this, her, half, brother, was, keeping, her, from, the, political, turmoil, going, on, in, the, kingdom, though, isabella, had, full, knowledge, of, what, was, going, on, and, of, her, role, in, the, feuds, after, a, rumor, spread, that, joanna, was, not, actually, the, daughter, of, king, henry, but, rather, of, a, royal, favorite, beltr, n, de, la, cueva, noblemen, confronted, king, henry, and, demanded, that, the, king, s, younger, half, brother, alfonso, be, named, his, successor, they, even, went, so, far, as, to, ask, alfonso, to, seize, the, throne, the, nobles, now, in, control, of, alfonso, and, claiming, that, he, was, the, true, heir, clashed, with, king, henry, s, forces, at, the, second, battle, of, olmedo, in, 1467, the, battle, was, a, draw, king, henry, agreed, to, recognize, alfonso, as, his, heir, presumptive, provided, that, he, would, marry, his, daughter, princess, joanna, soon, after, he, was, named, prince, of, asturias, he, died, at, the, age, of, fourteen, in, july, 1468, the, nobles, who, had, supported, him, suspected, poisoning, as, she, had, been, named, in, her, brother, s, will, as, his, successor, the, nobles, asked, isabella, to, take, his, place, as, champion, of, the, rebellion, however, support, for, the, rebels, had, begun, to, wane, and, isabella, preferred, a, negotiated, settlement, to, continuing, the, war, she, met, with, her, elder, half, brother, henry, at, toros, de, guisando, and, they, reached, a, compromise, the, war, would, stop, king, henry, would, name, isabella, his, heir, presumptive, instead, of, his, daughter, joanna, and, isabella, would, not, marry, without, her, half, brother, s, consent, but, he, would, not, be, able, to, force, her, to, marry, against, her, will, isabella, s, side, came, out, with, most, of, what, the, nobles, desired, though, they, did, not, go, so, far, as, to, officially, depose, king, henry, they, were, not, powerful, enough, to, do, so, and, isabella, did, not, want, to, jeopardize, the, principle, of, fair, inherited, succession, since, it, was, upon, this, idea, that, she, had, based, her, argument, for, legitimacy, as, heir, presumptive, the, question, of, isabella, s, marriage, was, not, a, new, one, she, had, at, the, age, of, six, a, betrothal, to, ferdinand, the, younger, son, of, john, ii, of, navarre, whose, family, was, a, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, trast, mara, at, that, time, the, two, kings, henry, and, john, were, eager, to, show, their, mutual, love, and, confidence, and, they, believed, that, this, alliance, would, make, their, eternal, friendship, obvious, to, the, world, this, arrangement, however, did, not, last, long, ferdinand, s, uncle, alfonso, v, of, aragon, died, in, 1458, all, of, alfonso, s, spanish, territories, as, well, as, the, islands, of, sicily, and, sardinia, were, left, to, his, brother, john, ii, john, now, had, a, stronger, position, than, ever, before, and, no, longer, needed, the, security, of, henry, s, friendship, henry, was, now, in, need, of, a, new, alliance, he, saw, the, chance, for, this, much, needed, new, friendship, in, charles, of, viana, john, s, elder, son, charles, was, constantly, at, odds, with, his, father, and, because, of, this, he, secretly, entered, into, an, alliance, with, henry, iv, of, castile, a, major, part, of, the, alliance, was, that, a, marriage, was, to, be, arranged, between, charles, and, isabella, when, john, ii, learned, of, this, arranged, marriage, he, was, outraged, isabella, had, been, intended, for, his, favorite, younger, son, ferdinand, and, in, his, eyes, this, alliance, was, still, valid, john, ii, had, his, son, charles, thrown, in, prison, on, charges, of, plotting, against, his, father, s, life, charles, died, in, 1461, in, 1465, an, attempt, was, made, to, marry, isabella, to, afonso, v, of, portugal, henry, s, brother, in, law, through, the, medium, of, the, queen, and, count, of, ledesma, a, portuguese, alliance, was, made, isabella, however, was, wary, of, the, marriage, and, refused, to, consent, a, civil, war, broke, out, in, castile, over, king, henry, s, inability, to, act, as, sovereign, henry, now, needed, a, quick, way, to, please, the, rebels, of, the, kingdom, as, part, of, an, agreement, to, restore, peace, isabella, was, then, to, be, betrothed, to, pedro, gir, n, acu, a, pacheco, master, of, the, order, of, calatrava, and, brother, to, the, king, s, favorite, juan, pacheco, in, return, don, pedro, would, pay, into, the, royal, treasury, an, enormous, sum, of, money, seeing, no, alternative, henry, agreed, to, the, marriage, isabella, was, aghast, and, prayed, to, god, that, the, marriage, would, not, come, to, pass, her, prayers, were, answered, when, don, pedro, suddenly, fell, ill, and, died, while, on, his, way, to, meet, his, fianc, e, when, henry, had, recognized, isabella, as, his, heir, presumptive, on, 19, september, 1468, he, had, also, promised, that, his, half, sister, should, not, be, compelled, to, marry, against, her, will, while, she, in, return, had, agreed, to, obtain, his, consent, it, seemed, that, the, years, of, failed, attempts, at, political, marriages, were, finally, over, there, was, talk, of, a, marriage, to, edward, iv, of, england, or, to, one, of, his, brothers, probably, richard, duke, of, gloucester, but, this, alliance, was, never, seriously, considered, once, again, in, 1468, a, marriage, proposal, arrived, from, afonso, v, of, portugal, going, against, his, promises, made, in, september, 1468, henry, tried, to, make, the, marriage, a, reality, if, isabella, married, afonso, henry, s, daughter, joanna, would, marry, afonso, s, son, john, ii, and, thus, after, the, death, of, the, old, king, john, and, joanna, could, inherit, portugal, and, castile, isabella, refused, and, made, a, secret, promise, to, marry, her, cousin, and, very, first, betrothed, ferdinand, of, aragon, after, this, failed, attempt, henry, once, again, went, against, his, promises, and, tried, to, marry, isabella, to, louis, xi, s, brother, charles, duke, of, berry, in, henry, s, eyes, this, alliance, would, cement, the, friendship, of, castile, and, france, as, well, as, remove, isabella, from, castilian, affairs, however, isabella, once, again, refused, the, proposal, meanwhile, john, ii, of, aragon, negotiated, in, secret, with, isabella, a, wedding, to, his, son, ferdinand, after, her, marriage, to, ferdinand, several, anonymous, journal, entries, claim, the, queen, was, unfaithful, and, plotted, against, the, king, on, 18, october, 1469, the, formal, betrothal, took, place, because, isabella, and, ferdinand, were, second, cousins, they, stood, within, the, prohibited, degrees, of, consanguinity, and, the, marriage, would, not, be, legal, unless, a, dispensation, from, the, pope, was, obtained, with, the, help, of, the, valencian, cardinal, rodrigo, borgia, later, pope, alexander, vi, isabella, and, ferdinand, were, presented, with, a, supposed, papal, bull, by, pope, pius, ii, who, had, actually, died, in, 1464, authorizing, ferdinand, to, marry, within, the, third, degree, of, consanguinity, making, their, marriage, legal, afraid, of, opposition, isabella, eloped, from, the, court, of, henry, with, the, excuse, of, visiting, her, brother, alfonso, s, tomb, in, vila, ferdinand, on, the, other, hand, crossed, castile, in, secret, disguised, as, a, servant, they, married, immediately, upon, reuniting, on, 19, october, 1469, in, the, palacio, de, los, vivero, in, the, city, of, valladolid, on, 12, december, 1474, news, of, king, henry, iv, s, death, in, madrid, which, had, happened, on, 11, december, reached, segovia, this, prompted, isabella, to, take, refuge, within, the, walls, of, the, alc, zar, of, segovia, where, she, received, the, support, of, andres, de, cabrera, and, segovia, s, council, the, next, day, isabella, was, proclaimed, queen, of, castile, and, le, n, isabella, s, reign, got, off, to, a, rocky, start, king, henry, iv, had, named, isabella, as, his, successor, so, when, she, ascended, to, the, throne, in, 1474, there, were, already, several, plots, against, her, diego, pacheco, the, marquis, of, villena, and, his, followers, maintained, that, joanna, la, beltraneja, henry, s, daughter, was, the, rightful, queen, shortly, after, the, marquis, made, his, claim, the, archbishop, of, toledo, his, great, uncle, and, a, longtime, supporter, of, isabella, left, court, to, plot, with, him, they, made, plans, to, have, joanna, marry, her, uncle, king, afonso, v, of, portugal, and, invade, castile, to, claim, the, throne, for, themselves, in, may, 1475, king, afonso, and, his, army, crossed, into, spain, and, advanced, to, plasencia, here, he, married, the, young, joanna, a, long, and, bloody, war, for, the, castilian, succession, then, took, place, the, war, went, back, and, forth, for, almost, a, year, until, the, battle, of, toro, on, 1, march, 1476, in, which, both, sides, claimed, and, celebrated, victory, the, troops, of, king, afonso, v, were, beaten, by, the, castilian, centre, left, commanded, by, the, duke, of, alba, and, cardinal, mendoza, while, the, forces, led, by, john, of, portugal, defeated, the, castilian, right, wing, and, remained, in, possession, of, the, battlefield, but, despite, its, uncertain, outcome, the, battle, of, toro, represented, a, great, political, victory, for, the, catholic, monarchs, assuring, them, the, throne, since, the, supporters, of, joanna, la, beltraneja, disbanded, and, the, portuguese, army, without, allies, left, castile, as, summarized, by, the, historian, justo, l, gonz, lez, both, armies, faced, each, other, at, the, camps, of, toro, resulting, in, an, indecisive, battle, but, while, the, portuguese, king, reorganized, his, troops, ferdinand, sent, news, to, all, the, cities, of, castile, and, to, several, foreign, kingdoms, informing, them, about, a, huge, victory, where, the, portuguese, were, crushed, faced, with, these, news, the, party, of, la, beltraneja, was, dissolved, and, the, portuguese, were, forced, to, return, to, their, kingdom, with, great, political, vision, isabella, took, advantage, of, the, moment, and, convoked, courts, at, madrigal, segovia, april, october, 1476, where, her, eldest, child, and, daughter, isabella, was, first, sworn, as, heiress, to, castile, s, crown, that, was, equivalent, to, legitimizing, isabella, s, own, throne, in, august, of, the, same, year, isabella, proved, her, abilities, as, a, powerful, ruler, on, her, own, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, segovia, and, isabella, rode, out, to, suppress, it, as, her, husband, ferdinand, was, off, fighting, at, the, time, going, against, the, advice, of, her, male, advisors, isabella, rode, by, herself, into, the, city, to, negotiate, with, the, rebels, she, was, successful, and, the, rebellion, was, quickly, brought, to, an, end, two, years, later, isabella, further, secured, her, place, as, ruler, with, the, birth, of, her, son, john, prince, of, asturias, on, 30, june, 1478, to, many, the, presence, of, a, male, heir, legitimized, her, place, as, ruler, meanwhile, the, castilian, and, portuguese, fleets, fought, for, hegemony, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, for, the, wealth, of, guinea, gold, and, slaves, where, the, decisive, naval, battle, of, guinea, was, fought, the, war, dragged, on, for, another, three, years, and, ended, with, a, castilian, victory, on, land, and, a, portuguese, victory, on, the, sea, the, four, separate, peace, treaties, signed, at, alc, ovas, 4, september, 1479, reflected, that, result, portugal, gave, up, the, throne, of, castile, in, favor, of, isabella, in, exchange, for, a, very, favorable, share, of, the, atlantic, territories, disputed, with, castile, they, all, went, to, portugal, with, the, exception, of, the, canary, islands, guinea, with, its, mines, of, gold, cape, verde, madeira, azores, and, the, right, of, conquest, over, the, kingdom, of, fez, plus, a, large, war, compensation, 106, 676, dobles, of, gold, the, catholic, monarchs, also, had, to, accept, that, joanna, la, beltraneja, remain, in, portugal, instead, of, spain, and, to, pardon, all, rebellious, subjects, who, had, supported, joanna, and, king, afonso, and, the, catholic, monarchs, who, had, proclaimed, themselves, rulers, of, portugal, and, donated, lands, to, noblemen, inside, this, country, had, to, give, up, the, portuguese, crown, at, alc, ovas, isabella, and, ferdinand, had, secured, the, throne, but, the, portuguese, exclusive, right, of, navigation, and, commerce, in, all, of, the, atlantic, ocean, south, of, the, canary, islands, meant, that, spain, was, practically, blocked, out, of, the, atlantic, and, was, deprived, of, the, gold, of, guinea, which, induced, anger, in, andalusia, spanish, academic, antonio, rumeu, de, armas, claims, that, with, the, peace, treaty, of, alc, ovas, in, 1479, the, catholic, monarchs, buy, the, peace, at, an, excessively, expensive, price, and, historian, m, monserrat, le, n, guerrero, added, that, they, find, themselves, forced, to, abandon, their, expansion, by, the, atlantic, christopher, columbus, freed, castile, from, this, difficult, situation, because, his, new, world, discovery, led, to, a, new, and, much, more, balanced, sharing, of, the, atlantic, at, tordesillas, in, 1494, as, the, orders, received, by, columbus, in, his, first, voyage, 1492, show, have, always, in, mind, that, the, limits, signed, in, the, share, of, alc, ovas, should, not, be, overcome, and, thus, they, insist, with, columbus, to, sail, along, the, parallel, of, canary, thus, by, sponsoring, the, columbian, adventure, to, the, west, the, spanish, monarchs, were, trying, the, only, remaining, path, of, expansion, now, that, she, had, succeeded, in, securing, her, place, on, the, castilian, throne, she, could, begin, to, institute, the, reforms, that, she, planned, for, the, kingdom, when, isabella, came, to, the, throne, in, 1474, castile, was, in, a, state, of, despair, due, to, her, brother, henry, s, reign, it, was, known, that, henry, iv, was, a, big, spender, and, did, little, to, enforce, the, laws, of, his, kingdom, it, was, even, said, by, one, castilian, denizen, of, the, time, that, murder, rape, and, robbery, happened, without, punishment, because, of, this, isabella, needed, desperately, to, find, a, way, to, reform, her, kingdom, due, to, the, measures, she, imposed, historians, during, her, lifetime, saw, her, to, be, more, inclined, to, justice, than, to, mercy, and, indeed, far, more, rigorous, and, unforgiving, than, her, husband, ferdinand, isabella, s, first, major, reform, came, during, the, cortes, of, madrigal, in, 1476, in, the, form, of, a, police, force, la, santa, hermandad, the, holy, brotherhood, although, 1476, was, not, the, first, time, that, castile, had, seen, the, hermandad, it, was, the, first, time, that, the, police, force, was, used, by, the, crown, during, the, late, medieval, period, the, expression, hermandad, had, been, used, to, describe, groups, of, men, who, came, together, of, their, own, accord, to, regulate, law, and, order, by, patrolling, the, roads, and, countryside, and, punishing, malefactors, these, brotherhoods, had, usually, been, suppressed, by, the, monarch, however, furthermore, before, 1476, the, justice, system, in, most, parts, of, the, country, was, effectively, under, the, control, of, dissident, members, of, the, nobility, rather, than, royal, officials, to, fix, this, problem, during, 1476, a, general, hermandad, was, established, for, castile, leon, and, asturias, the, police, force, was, to, be, made, up, of, locals, who, were, to, regulate, the, crime, occurring, in, the, kingdom, it, was, to, be, paid, for, by, a, tax, of, 1800, maraved, s, on, every, one, hundred, households, in, 1477, isabella, visited, extremadura, and, andalusia, to, introduce, this, more, efficient, police, force, there, as, well, keeping, with, her, reformation, of, the, regulation, of, laws, in, 1481, isabella, charged, two, officials, with, restoring, peace, in, galicia, this, turbulent, province, had, been, the, prey, of, tyrant, nobles, since, the, days, of, isabella, s, father, john, ii, robbers, had, infested, the, highways, and, oppressed, the, smaller, towns, and, villages, the, officials, isabella, charged, set, off, with, the, herculean, task, of, restoring, peace, for, the, province, and, were, ultimately, successful, indeed, they, drove, over, 1, 500, robbers, from, galicia, from, the, very, beginning, of, her, reign, isabella, fully, grasped, the, importance, of, restoring, the, crown, s, finances, the, reign, of, henry, iv, had, left, the, kingdom, of, castile, in, great, debt, upon, examination, it, was, found, that, the, chief, cause, of, the, nation, s, poverty, was, the, wholesale, alienation, of, royal, estates, during, henry, s, reign, to, make, money, henry, had, sold, off, royal, estates, at, prices, well, below, their, value, the, cortes, of, toledo, of, 1480, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, only, hope, of, lasting, financial, reform, lay, in, a, resumption, of, these, alienated, lands, and, rents, this, decision, was, warmly, approved, by, many, leading, nobles, of, the, court, but, isabella, was, reluctant, to, take, such, drastic, measures, it, was, decided, that, the, archbishop, of, toledo, would, hold, an, enquiry, into, the, tenure, of, estates, and, rents, acquired, during, henry, iv, s, reign, those, that, had, not, been, granted, as, a, reward, for, services, were, to, be, restored, without, compensation, while, those, that, had, been, sold, at, a, price, far, below, their, real, value, were, to, be, bought, back, at, the, same, sum, while, many, of, the, nobility, were, forced, to, pay, large, sums, of, money, for, their, estates, the, royal, treasury, became, even, richer, isabella, s, one, stipulation, was, that, there, would, be, no, revocation, of, gifts, made, to, churches, hospitals, or, the, poor, another, issue, of, money, was, the, overproduction, of, coinage, and, the, abundance, of, mints, in, the, kingdom, during, henry, s, reign, the, number, of, mints, regularly, producing, money, had, increased, from, just, five, to, 150, much, of, the, coinage, produced, in, these, mints, was, nearly, worthless, during, the, first, year, of, her, reign, isabella, established, a, monopoly, over, the, royal, mints, and, fixed, a, legal, standard, to, which, the, coinage, had, to, approximate, by, shutting, down, many, of, the, mints, and, taking, royal, control, over, the, production, of, money, isabella, restored, the, confidence, of, the, public, in, the, crown, s, ability, to, handle, the, kingdom, s, finances, both, isabella, and, ferdinand, established, very, few, new, governmental, and, administrative, institutions, in, their, respective, kingdoms, especially, in, castile, their, main, achievement, was, to, use, more, effectively, the, institutions, that, had, existed, during, the, reigns, of, john, ii, and, henry, iv, historically, the, center, of, the, castilian, government, had, been, the, royal, household, together, with, its, surrounding, court, the, household, was, traditionally, divided, into, two, overlapping, bodies, the, first, body, was, made, up, of, household, officials, mainly, people, of, the, nobility, who, carried, out, governmental, and, political, functions, for, which, they, received, special, payment, the, second, body, was, made, up, of, some, 200, permanent, servants, or, continos, who, performed, a, wide, range, of, confidential, functions, on, behalf, of, the, rulers, by, the, 1470s, when, isabella, began, to, take, a, firm, grip, on, the, royal, administration, the, senior, offices, of, the, royal, household, were, simply, honorary, titles, and, held, strictly, by, the, nobility, the, positions, of, a, more, secretarial, nature, were, often, held, by, senior, churchmen, substantial, revenues, were, attached, to, such, offices, and, were, therefore, enjoyed, greatly, on, an, effectively, hereditary, basis, by, the, great, castilian, houses, of, nobility, while, the, nobles, held, the, titles, individuals, of, lesser, breeding, did, the, real, work, traditionally, the, main, advisory, body, to, the, rulers, of, castile, was, the, royal, council, the, council, under, the, monarch, had, full, power, to, resolve, all, legal, and, political, disputes, the, council, was, responsible, for, supervising, all, senior, administrative, officials, such, as, the, crown, representatives, in, all, of, the, major, towns, it, was, also, the, supreme, judicial, tribunal, of, the, kingdom, in, 1480, during, the, cortes, of, toledo, isabella, made, many, reforms, to, the, royal, council, previously, there, had, been, two, distinct, yet, overlapping, categories, of, royal, councillor, one, formed, a, group, which, possessed, both, judicial, and, administrative, responsibilities, this, portion, consisted, of, some, bishops, some, nobles, and, an, increasingly, important, element, of, professional, administrators, with, legal, training, known, as, letrados, the, second, category, of, traditional, councillor, had, a, less, formal, role, this, role, depended, greatly, on, the, individuals, political, influence, and, personal, influence, with, the, monarch, during, isabella, s, reign, the, role, of, this, second, category, was, completely, eliminated, as, mentioned, previously, isabella, had, little, care, for, personal, bribes, or, favors, because, of, this, this, second, type, of, councillor, usually, of, the, nobility, was, only, allowed, to, attend, the, council, of, castile, as, an, observer, isabella, began, to, rely, more, on, the, professional, administrators, than, ever, before, these, men, were, mostly, of, the, bourgeoisie, or, lesser, nobility, the, council, was, also, rearranged, and, it, was, officially, settled, that, one, bishop, three, caballeros, and, eight, or, nine, lawyers, would, serve, on, the, council, at, a, time, while, the, nobles, were, no, longer, directly, involved, in, the, matters, of, state, they, were, welcome, to, attend, the, meetings, isabella, hoped, that, forcing, the, nobility, to, choose, whether, to, participate, or, not, would, weed, out, those, who, were, not, dedicated, to, the, state, and, its, cause, isabella, also, saw, the, need, to, provide, a, personal, relationship, between, herself, as, the, monarch, and, her, subjects, therefore, isabella, and, ferdinand, set, aside, a, time, every, friday, during, which, they, themselves, would, sit, and, allow, people, to, come, to, them, with, complaints, this, was, a, new, form, of, personal, justice, that, castile, had, not, seen, before, the, council, of, state, was, reformed, and, presided, over, by, the, king, and, queen, this, department, of, public, affairs, dealt, mainly, with, foreign, negotiations, hearing, embassies, and, transacting, business, with, the, court, of, rome, in, addition, to, these, departments, there, was, also, a, supreme, court, of, the, santa, hermandad, a, council, of, finance, and, a, council, for, settling, purely, aragonese, matters, although, isabella, made, many, reforms, that, seem, to, have, made, the, cortes, stronger, in, actuality, the, cortes, lost, political, power, during, the, reigns, of, isabella, and, ferdinand, isabella, and, her, husband, moved, in, the, direction, of, a, non, parliamentary, government, and, the, cortes, became, an, almost, passive, advisory, body, giving, automatic, assent, to, legislation, which, had, been, drafted, by, the, royal, administration, after, the, reforms, of, the, cortes, of, toledo, the, queen, ordered, a, noted, jurist, alfonso, diaz, de, montalvo, to, undertake, the, task, of, clearing, away, legal, rubbish, and, compiling, what, remained, into, a, comprehensive, code, within, four, years, the, work, stood, completed, in, eight, bulky, volumes, and, the, ordenanzas, reales, took, their, place, on, legal, bookshelves, at, the, end, of, the, reconquista, only, granada, was, left, for, isabella, and, ferdinand, to, conquer, the, emirate, of, granada, had, been, held, by, the, muslim, nasrid, dynasty, since, the, mid, 13th, century, protected, by, natural, barriers, and, fortified, towns, it, had, withstood, the, long, process, of, the, reconquista, on, 1, february, 1482, the, king, and, queen, reached, medina, del, campo, and, this, is, generally, considered, the, beginning, of, the, granada, war, while, isabella, s, and, ferdinand, s, involvement, in, the, war, was, apparent, from, the, start, granada, s, leadership, was, divided, and, never, able, to, present, a, united, front, it, still, took, ten, years, to, conquer, granada, however, culminating, in, 1492, the, spanish, monarchs, recruited, soldiers, from, many, european, countries, and, improved, their, artillery, with, the, latest, and, best, cannon, systematically, they, proceeded, to, take, the, kingdom, piece, by, piece, in, 1485, they, laid, siege, to, ronda, which, surrendered, after, only, a, fortnight, due, to, extensive, bombardment, the, following, year, loja, was, taken, and, again, muhammad, xii, was, captured, and, released, one, year, later, with, the, fall, of, m, laga, the, western, part, of, the, muslim, nasrid, kingdom, had, fallen, into, spanish, hands, the, eastern, province, succumbed, after, the, fall, of, baza, in, 1489, the, siege, of, granada, began, in, the, spring, of, 1491, and, muhammad, xii, finally, surrendered, at, the, end, of, the, year, on, 2, january, 1492, isabella, and, ferdinand, entered, granada, to, receive, the, keys, of, the, city, and, the, principal, mosque, was, consecrated, as, a, church, the, treaty, of, granada, was, signed, later, that, year, in, it, ferdinand, and, isabella, gave, their, word, to, allow, the, muslims, and, jews, of, granada, to, live, in, peace, during, the, war, isabella, noted, the, abilities, and, energy, of, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, and, made, him, one, of, the, two, commissioners, for, the, negotiations, under, her, patronage, de, c, rdoba, went, on, to, an, extraordinary, military, career, that, revolutionized, the, organization, and, tactics, of, the, emerging, spanish, military, changing, the, nature, of, warfare, and, altering, the, european, balance, of, power, just, three, months, after, entering, granada, queen, isabella, agreed, to, sponsor, christopher, columbus, on, an, expedition, to, reach, the, east, indies, by, sailing, west, for, a, distance, of, 2, 000, miles, according, to, columbus, the, crown, agreed, to, pay, a, sum, of, money, as, a, concession, from, monarch, to, subject, columbus, s, expedition, departed, on, 3, august, 1492, and, arrived, in, the, new, world, on, 12, october, he, returned, the, next, year, and, presented, his, findings, to, the, monarchs, bringing, natives, and, gold, under, a, hero, s, welcome, although, columbus, was, sponsored, by, the, castilian, queen, treasury, accounts, show, no, royal, payments, to, him, until, 1493, after, his, first, voyage, was, complete, spain, then, entered, a, golden, age, of, exploration, and, colonization, the, period, of, the, spanish, empire, in, 1494, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, isabella, and, ferdinand, agreed, to, divide, the, earth, outside, of, europe, with, king, john, ii, of, portugal, the, portuguese, did, not, recognize, that, south, america, belonged, to, the, spanish, because, it, was, in, portugal, s, sphere, of, influence, and, king, john, ii, threatened, to, send, an, army, to, claim, the, land, for, the, portuguese, isabella, was, not, in, favor, of, enslaving, the, american, natives, she, established, the, royal, position, on, how, the, indigenous, people, should, be, treated, by, following, the, recent, policies, implemented, in, the, canary, islands, which, had, a, small, number, of, native, inhabitants, which, stated, that, all, peoples, were, subjects, of, the, crown, of, castile, and, could, not, be, enslaved, in, most, situations, she, was, annoyed, by, the, enslavement, of, the, natives, by, columbus, and, established, a, royal, position, on, how, the, indigenous, shall, be, treated, there, were, some, circumstances, in, which, a, person, could, be, enslaved, including, being, a, prisoner, of, war, or, for, practising, cannibalism, or, sodomy, after, an, episode, in, which, columbus, captured, 1, 200, men, isabella, ordered, their, return, and, the, arrest, of, columbus, who, was, insulted, in, the, streets, of, granada, isabella, realized, that, she, could, not, trust, all, the, conquest, and, evangelization, to, take, place, through, one, man, so, she, opened, the, range, for, other, expeditions, led, by, alonso, de, hojeda, juan, de, la, cosa, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, diego, de, lepe, or, pedro, alonso, ni, o, to, prevent, her, efforts, from, being, reversed, in, the, future, isabella, instructed, her, descendants, in, her, last, will, as, follows, do, not, give, rise, to, or, allow, the, indians, to, receive, any, wrong, in, their, persons, and, property, but, rather, that, they, be, treated, well, and, fairly, and, if, they, have, received, any, wrong, remedy, it, with, the, institution, of, the, roman, catholic, inquisition, in, spain, and, with, the, dominican, friar, tom, s, de, torquemada, as, the, first, inquisitor, general, the, catholic, monarchs, pursued, a, policy, of, religious, and, national, unity, though, isabella, opposed, taking, harsh, measures, against, jews, on, economic, grounds, torquemada, was, able, to, convince, ferdinand, on, 31, march, 1492, the, alhambra, decree, for, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, was, issued, the, jews, had, until, the, end, of, july, four, months, to, leave, the, country, and, they, were, not, to, take, with, them, gold, silver, money, arms, or, horses, traditionally, it, had, been, claimed, that, as, many, as, 200, 000, jews, left, spain, but, recent, historians, have, shown, that, such, figures, are, exaggerated, henry, kamen, has, shown, that, out, of, a, total, population, of, 80, 000, jews, a, maximum, of, 40, 000, left, and, the, rest, converted, hundreds, of, those, that, remained, came, under, the, inquisition, s, investigations, into, relapsed, conversos, marranos, and, the, judaizers, who, had, been, abetting, them, isabella, was, given, the, title, of, catholic, monarch, by, pope, alexander, vi, of, whose, behavior, and, involvement, in, matters, isabella, did, not, approve, along, with, the, physical, unification, of, spain, isabella, and, ferdinand, embarked, on, a, process, of, spiritual, unification, trying, to, bring, the, country, under, one, faith, roman, catholicism, as, part, of, this, process, the, inquisition, became, institutionalized, after, a, muslim, uprising, in, 1499, and, further, troubles, thereafter, the, treaty, of, granada, was, broken, in, 1502, and, muslims, were, ordered, to, either, become, christians, or, to, leave, isabella, s, confessor, cisneros, was, named, archbishop, of, toledo, he, was, instrumental, in, a, program, of, rehabilitation, of, the, religious, institutions, of, spain, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, later, counter, reformation, as, chancellor, he, exerted, more, and, more, power, isabella, and, her, husband, had, created, an, empire, and, in, later, years, were, consumed, with, administration, and, politics, they, were, concerned, with, the, succession, and, worked, to, link, the, spanish, crown, to, the, other, rulers, in, europe, by, early, 1497, all, the, pieces, seemed, to, be, in, place, the, son, and, heir, john, prince, of, asturias, married, a, habsburg, princess, archduchess, margaret, of, austria,

isabella, did, however, make, successful, dynastic, matches, for, her, two, youngest, daughters, the, death, of, isabella, of, aragon, created, a, necessity, for, manuel, i, of, portugal, to, remarry,

of, strong, stocky, build, of, a, very, fair, complexion, and, had, a, hair, color, that, was, between, strawberry, blonde, and, auburn, other, descriptions, however, describe, her, hair, as, golden, blonde, and, period, illuminations, show, her, several, times, with, golden, or, strawberry, blond, hair, some, portraits, show, her, as, a, brunette, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, many, old, portraits, from, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, are, victims, of, a, phenomenon, that, causes, hair, pigments, to, go, dark, brown, however, the, statue, of, her, in, granada, cathedral, by, burgundian, sculptor, philippe, de, vigarny, born, in, langres, in, what, is, now, france, also, shows, her, as, a, dark, haired, brunette, her, daughters, joanna, and, catherine, were, thought, to, resemble, her, the, most, in, looks, both, are, similarly, described, in, contemporary, sources, as, having, auburn, hair, but, surviving, paintings, often, show, them, as, brunettes, due, to, the, same, pigmentation, problem, isabella, maintained, an, austere, temperate, lifestyle, and, her, religious, spirit, influenced, her, the, most, in, life, in, spite, of, her, hostility, towards, the,

beatification, and, canonization, of, isabella, three, and, a, half, thousand, documents, were, chosen, to, be, included, in, 27, volumes, in, 1970, that, commission, determined, that, a, canonical, process, for, the, canonization, of, isabella, the, catholic, could, be, undertaken, with, a, sense, of, security, since, there, was, not, found, one, single, act, public, or, private, of, queen, isabella, that, was, not, inspired, by, christian, and, evangelical, criteria, moreover, there, was, a, reputation, of, sanctity, uninterrupted, for, five, centuries, and, as, the, investigation, was, progressing, it, was, more, accentuated, in, 1972, the, process, of, valladolid, was, officially, submitted, to, the, congregation, for, the, causes, of, saints, in, the, vatican, this, process, was,

bishops, reopen, isabella, s, cause, for, canonization, some, authors, have, claimed, that, isabella, s, reputation, for, sanctity, derives, in, large, measure, from, an, image, carefully, shaped, and, disseminated, by, the, queen, herself, as, princess, of, asturias, isabella, bore, the, undifferenced, royal, arms, of, the, crown, of, castile, and, added, the, saint, john, the, evangelist, s,
