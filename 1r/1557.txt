of, the, civil, rights, movement, was, to, end, disenfranchisement, of, african, americans, but, the, nation, of, islam, forbade, its, members, from, participating, in, voting, and, other, aspects, of, the, political, process, the, naacp, and, other, civil, rights, organizations, denounced, him, and, the, nation, of, islam, as, irresponsible, extremists, whose, views, did, not, represent, the,

black, people, in, america, should, be, created, he, rejected, the, civil, rights, movement, s, strategy, of, nonviolence, arguing, that, black, people, should, defend, and, advance, themselves, by, any, means, necessary, his, speeches, had, a, powerful, effect, on, his, audiences, who, were, generally, african, americans, in, northern, and, western, cities, many, of, them, tired, of, being, told, to, wait, for, freedom, justice, equality, and, respect, felt, that, he, articulated, their, complaints, better, than, did, the, civil, rights, movement, malcolm, x, has, been, widely, accused, of, being, antisemitic, his, autobiography, contains, several, antisemitic, charges, and, caricatures, of, jews, alex, haley, the, autobiography, s, co, author, had, to, rewrite, some, of, the, book,

authentic, and, introduced, it, to, noi, members, while, accusing, the, jewish, people, of, perfecting, the, modern, evil, of, neo, colonialism, he, helped, change, the, black, community, s, image, of, the, holocaust, engaging, in, holocaust, trivialization, and, claiming, that, the, jews, brought, it, on, themselves, in, 1961, malcolm, x, spoke, at, a, noi, rally, alongside, george, lincoln,

statements, about, jews, continued, even, close, to, his, death, referring, to, jews, as, bloodsucker, in, statements, he, made, during, the, last, months, of, his, life, malcolm, x, is, widely, regarded, as, the, second, most, influential, leader, of, the, nation, of, islam, after, elijah, muhammad, he, is, largely, credited, with, helping, the, group, s, dramatic, increase, in, membership, between, the, early, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, from, around, 1, 200, to, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, members, with, up, to, 25, 000, actively, attending, according, to, estimates, he, inspired, the, boxer, muhammad, ali, to, join, the, nation, and, the, two, became, close, in, january, 1964, ali, brought, malcolm, x, and, his, family, to, miami, to, watch, him, train, for, his, fight, against, sonny, liston, when, malcolm, x, left, the, nation, of, islam, he, tried, to, convince, ali, who, had, just, been, renamed, by, elijah, muhammad, to, join, him, in, converting, to, sunni, islam, but, ali, instead, broke, ties, with, him, later, describing, the, break, as, one, of, his, greatest, regrets, malcolm, x, mentored, and, guided, louis, x, later, known, as, louis, farrakhan, who, eventually, became, the, leader, of, the, nation, of, islam, malcolm, x, also, served, as, a, mentor, and, confidant, to, elijah, muhammad, s, son, wallace, d, muhammad, the, son, told, malcolm, x, about, his, skepticism, toward, his, father, s, unorthodox, approach, to, islam, wallace, muhammad, was, excommunicated, from, the, nation, of, islam, several, times, although, he, was, eventually, re, admitted, during, 1962, and, 1963, events, caused, malcolm, x, to, reassess, his, relationship, with, the, nation, of, islam, and, particularly, its, leader, elijah, muhammad, in, late, 1961, there, were, violent, confrontations, between, the, nation, of, islam, members, and, police, in, south, central, los, angeles, and, numerous, muslims, were, arrested, they, were, acquitted, but, tensions, had, been, raised, just, after, midnight, on, april, 27, 1962, two, lapd, officers, unprovoked, shoved, and, beat, several, muslims, outside, temple, number, 27, a, large, crowd, of, angry, muslims, emerged, from, the, mosque, and, the, officers, attempted, to, intimidate, them, one, officer, was, disarmed, his, partner, was, shot, in, the, elbow, by, a, third, officer, more, than, 70,

the, back, and, paralyzed, for, life, and, ronald, stokes, a, korean, war, veteran, who, was, shot, from, behind, while, raising, his, hands, over, his, head, to, surrender, killing, him, a, number, of, muslims, were, indicted, after, the, event, but, no, charges, were, laid, against, the, police, the, coroner, ruled, that, stokes, s, killing, was, justified, to, malcolm, x, the, desecration, of, the, mosque, and, the, associated, violence, demanded, action, and, he, used, what, louis, x, later, louis, farrakhan, later, called, his, gangsterlike, past, to, rally, the, more, hardened, of, the, nation, of, islam, members, to, take, violent, revenge, against, the, police, malcolm, x, sought, elijah, muhammad, s, approval, which, was, denied, stunning, malcolm, x, malcolm, x, was, again, blocked, by, elijah, muhammad, when, he, spoke, of, the, nation, of, islam, starting, to, work, with, civil, rights, organizations, local, black, politicians, and, religious, groups, louis, x, saw, this, as, an, important, turning, point, in, the, deteriorating, relationship, between, malcolm, x, and, muhammad, rumors, were, circulating, that, muhammad, was, conducting, extramarital, affairs, with, young, nation, secretaries, which, would, constitute, a, serious, violation, of, nation, teachings, after, first, discounting, the, rumors, malcolm, x, came, to, believe, them, after, he, spoke, with, muhammad, s, son, wallace, and, with, the, girls, making, the, accusations, muhammad, confirmed, the, rumors, in, 1963, attempting, to, justify, his, behavior, by, referring, to, precedents, set, by, biblical, prophets, over, a, series, of, national, tv, interviews, between, 1964, and, 1965, malcolm, x, provided, testimony, of, his, investigation, corroboration, and, confirmation, by,

also, revealed, an, assassination, attempt, made, on, his, life, through, a, discovered, explosive, device, in, his, car, as, well, as, the, death, threats, he, was, receiving, in, response, to, his,

message, of, condolence, to, the, kennedy, family, and, ordered, its, ministers, not, to, comment, on, the, assassination, publicly, censured, their, former, shining, star, malcolm, x, retained, his, post, and, rank, as, minister, but, was, prohibited, from, public, speaking, for, 90, days, malcolm, x, had, by, now, become, a, media, favorite, and, some, nation, members, believed, he, was, a, threat, to, elijah, muhammad, s, leadership, publishers, had, shown, interest, in, malcolm, x, s, autobiography, and, when, louis, lomax, wrote, his, 1963, book, about, the, nation, when, the, word, is, given, he, used, a, photograph, of, malcolm, x, on, the, cover, he, also, reproduced, five, of, his, speeches, but, featured, only, one, of, muhammad, s, which, greatly, upset, muhammad, and, made, him, envious, on, march, 8, 1964, malcolm, x, publicly, announced, his, break, from, the, nation, of, islam, though, still, a, muslim, he, felt, that, the, nation, had, gone, as, far, as, it, can, because, of, its, rigid, teachings, he, said, he, was, planning, to, organize, a, black, nationalist, organization, to, heighten, the, political, consciousness, of, african, americans, he, also,

americans, to, exercise, their, right, to, vote, wisely, but, cautioned, that, if, the, government, continued, to, prevent, african, americans, from, attaining, full, equality, it, might, be, necessary, for, them, to, take, up, arms, in, the, weeks, after, he, left, the, nation, of, islam, several, sunni, muslims, encouraged, malcolm, x, to, learn, about, their, faith, he, soon, converted, to, the, sunni, faith, in, april, 1964, with, financial, help, from, his, half, sister, ella, little, collins, malcolm, x, flew, to, jeddah, saudi, arabia, as, the, start, of, his, hajj, the, pilgrimage, to, mecca, obligatory, for, every, muslim, who, is, able, to, do, so, he, was, delayed, in, jeddah, when, his, u, s, citizenship, and, inability, to, speak, arabic, caused, his, status, as, a, muslim, to, be, questioned, he, had, received, abdul, rahman, hassan, azzam, s, book, the, eternal, message, of, muhammad, with, his, visa, approval, and, he, contacted, the, author, azzam, s,

later, after, completing, the, hajj, rituals, malcolm, x, had, an, audience, with, the, prince, malcolm, x, later, said, that, seeing, muslims, of, all, colors, from, blue, eyed, blonds, to, black, skinned, africans, interacting, as, equals, led, him, to, see, islam, as, a, means, by, which, racial, problems, could, be, overcome, malcolm, x, had, already, visited, the, united, arab, republic, a,

kwame, nkrumah, of, ghana, gamal, abdel, nasser, of, egypt, and, ahmed, ben, bella, of, algeria, had, all, invited, malcolm, x, to, serve, in, their, governments, after, he, spoke, at, the, university, of, ibadan, the, nigerian, muslim, students, association, bestowed, on, him, the, honorary, yoruba, name, omowale, the, son, who, has, come, home, he, later, called, this, his, most, treasured, honor, malcolm, especially, hated, mo, se, tshombe, of, the, congo, as, an, uncle, tom, figure, in, a, 1964, speech, in, new, york, he, called, tshombe, the, worse, african, ever, born, and, the, man, who, in, cold, blood, cold, blood, committed, an, international, crime, murdered, patrice, lumumba, tshombe, s, decision, in, 1964, to, hire, white, mercenaries, to, put, down, the, simba, rebellion, greatly, offended, malcolm, who, accused, the, mercenaries, of, committing, war, crimes, against, the, congolese, on, november, 23, 1964, on, his, way, home, from, africa, malcolm, x, stopped, in, paris, where, he, spoke, in, the, salle, de, la, mutualit, after, his, return, to, the, united, states, he, accused, the, united, states, of, imperialism, in, the, congo, by, supporting, tshombe, and, his, hired, killers, as, he, called, the, white, mercenaries, x, accused, tshombe, and, the, american, president, lyndon, b, johnson, of, sleeping, together, when, i, say, sleeping, together, i, don, t, mean, that, literally, but, beyond, that, they, re, in, the, same, bed, johnson, is, paying, the, salaries, paying, the, government, propping, up, tshombe, s, government, this, murderer, x, expressed, much, anger, about, operation, dragon, rouge, where, the, united, states, air, force, dropped, in, belgian, paratroopers, into, the, city, of, stanleyville, modern, kisangani, to, rescue, the, white, belgian, hostages, from, the, simbas, malcolm, x, maintained, that, there, was, a, double, standard, when, it, came, to, white, and, black, lives, noting, it, was, an, international, emergency, when, the, lives, of, whites, were, in, danger, making, dragon, rouge, necessary, but, that, nothing, was, done, to, stop, the, abuses, of, the, congolese, at, the, hands, of, tshombe, s, hired, killers, x, charged, that, the, congolese, have, been, massacred, by, white, people, for, years, and, years, and, that, chickens, come, home, to, roost, a, week, later, on, november, 30, malcolm, x, flew, to, the, united, kingdom, on, december, 3, he, took, part, in, a, debate, at, the, oxford, union, society, the, motion, was, taken, from, a, statement, made, earlier, that, year, by, u, s, presidential, candidate, barry, goldwater, extremism, in, the, defense, of, liberty, is, no, vice, moderation, in, the, pursuit, of, justice, is, no, virtue, malcolm, x, argued, for, the, affirmative, and, interest, in, the, debate, was, so, high, that, it, was, televised, nationally, by, the, bbc, in, his, address, at, oxford, malcolm, rejected, the, label, of, black, muslim, and, instead, focused, on, being, a, muslim, who, happened, to, be, black, which, reflected, his, conversion, to, sunni, islam, malcolm, only, mentioned, his, religion, twice, during, his, oxford, speech, which, was, part, of, his, effort, to, defuse, his, image, as, an, angry, black, muslim, extremist, which, he, had, long, hated, during, the, debate, at, oxford, he, criticized, the, way, the, anglo, american, press, portrayed, the, congo, crisis, noting, the, simbas, were, portrayed, as, primitive, cannibalistic, savages, who, engaged, in, every, form, of, depravity, imaginable, while, tshombe, and, the, white, mercenaries, were, portrayed, in, a, very, favorable, light, with, almost, no, mention, of, any, atrocities, on, their, part, malcolm, x, charged, that, the, cuban, migr, pilots, hired, by, the, cia, to, serve, as, tshombe, s, air, force, indiscriminately, bombed, congolese, villages, and, towns, killing, women, and, children, but, this, was, almost, never, mentioned, in, the, media, while, the, newspapers, featured, long, accounts, of, the, simbas, raping, white, women, molesting, nuns, likewise, he, felt, the, term, mercenary, was, inappropriate, preferring, the, term, hired, killer, and, that, tshombe, should, not, be, described, as, a, premier, as, he, preferred, the, term, cold, blooded, murderer, to, describe, him, malcolm, x, stated, that, what, he, regarded, as, the, extremism, of, the, tshombe, government, was, never, referred, to, as, extremism, because, it, is, endorsed, by, the, west, it, is, financed, by, america, it, s, made, respectable, by, america, and, that, kind, of, extremism, is, never, labelled, as, extremism, malcolm, x, argued, this, extremism, was, not, morally, acceptable, since, it, s, not, extremism, in, defense, of, liberty, many, in, the, audience, at, oxford, were, angered, by, malcolm, x, s, thesis, and, his, support, for, the, simbas, who, had, committed, atrocities, with, one, asking, what, sort, of, extremism, would, you, consider, the, killing, of, missionaries, in, response, malcolm, x, answered, it, is, an, act, of, war, i, d, call, it, the, same, kind, of, extremism, that, happened, when, england, dropped, bombs, on, german, cities, and, germans, dropped, bombs, on, english, cities, on, february, 5, 1965, malcolm, x, flew, to, the, united, kingdom, again, and, on,

compared, the, treatment, of, ethnic, minority, residents, with, the, treatment, of, jews, under, hitler, saying, i, would, not, wait, for, the, fascist, element, in, smethwick, to, erect, gas, ovens, after, returning, to, the, u, s, malcolm, x, addressed, a, wide, variety, of, audiences, he, spoke, regularly, at, meetings, held, by, mmi, and, the, oaau, and, was, one, of, the, most, sought, after,

brilliance, often, wild, unpredictable, and, eccentric, but, nevertheless, possessing, promise, that, must, now, remain, unrealized, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, malcolm, x, was, an, extraordinary, and, twisted, man, who, turn, many, true, gifts, to, evil, purpose, and, that, his, life, was, strangely, and, pitifully, wasted, time, called, him, an, unashamed, demagogue, whose, creed, was, violence, outside, the, us, particularly, in, africa, the, press, was, sympathetic, the, daily, times, of, nigeria, wrote, that, malcolm, x, would, have, a, place, in, the, palace, of, martyrs, the, ghanaian, times, likened, him, to, john, brown, medgar, evers, and, patrice, lumumba, and, counted, him, among, a, host, of, africans, and, americans, who, were, martyred, in, freedom,

a, product, of, the, hate, and, violence, invested, in, the, negro, s, blighted, existence, in, this, nation, in, his, youth, there, was, no, hope, no, preaching, teaching, or, movements, of, non, violence, it, is, a, testimony, to, malcolm, s, personal, depth, and, integrity, that, he, could, not, become, an, underworld, czar, but, turned, again, and, again, to, religion, for, meaning, and, destiny, malcolm, was, still, turning, and, growing, at, the, time, of, his, brutal, and, meaningless, assassination, like, the, murder, of, lumumba, the, murder, of, malcolm, x, deprives, the, world, of, a, potentially, great, leader, i, could, not, agree, with, either, of, these, men, but, i, could, see, in, them, a, capacity, for, leadership, which, i, could, respect, and, which, was, just,

many, speeches, and, interviews, he, gave, from, 1952, until, his, death, many, of, those, speeches, especially, from, the, last, year, of, his, life, were, recorded, and, have, been, published, the, white, liberal, differs, from, the, white, con, serv, a, tive, only, in, one, way, the, liberal, is, more, deceitful, than, the, conservative, malcolm, x, while, he, was, a, member, of, the, nation, of, islam, malcolm, x, taught, its, beliefs, and, his, statements, often, began, with, the, phrase, the, honorable, elijah, muhammad, teaches, us, that, it, is, virtually, impossible, now, to, discern, whether, malcolm, x, s, personal, beliefs, at, the, time, diverged, from, the, teachings, of, the, nation, of, islam, after, he, left, the, nation, in, 1964, he, compared, himself, to, a, ventriloquist, s, dummy, who, could, only, say, what, elijah, muhammad, told, him, to, say, malcolm, x, taught, that, black, people, were, the, original, people, of, the, world, and, that, whites, were, a, race, of, devils, who, were, created, by, an, evil, scientist, named, yakub, the, nation, of, islam, believed, that, black, people, were, superior, to, white, people, and, that, the, demise, of, the, white, race, was, imminent, when, questioned, concerning, his, statements, that, white, people, were, devils, malcolm, x, said, history, proves, the, white, man, is, a, devil, anybody, who, rapes, and, plunders, and, enslaves, and, steals, and, drops, hell, bombs, on, people, anybody, who, does, these, things, is, nothing, but, a, devil, he, said, malcolm, x, said, that, islam, was, the, true, religion, of, black, mankind, and, that, christianity, was, the, white, man, s, religion, that, had, been, imposed, upon, african, americans, by, their, slave, masters, he, said, that, the, nation, of, islam, followed, islam, as, it, was, practiced, around, the, world, but, the, nation, s, teachings, varied, from, those, of, other, muslims, because, they, were, adapted, to, the, uniquely, pitiful, condition, of, black, people, in, the, united, states, he, taught, that, wallace, fard, muhammad, the, founder, of, the, nation, was, god, incarnate, and, that, elijah, muhammad, was, his, messenger, or, prophet, while, the, civil, rights, movement, fought, against, racial, segregation, malcolm, x, advocated, the, complete, separation, of, blacks, from, whites, the, nation, of, islam, proposed, the, establishment, of, a, separate, country, for, african, americans, in, the, southern, or, southwestern, united, states, as, an, interim, measure, until, african, americans, could, return, to, africa, malcolm, x, suggested, the, united, states, government, owed, reparations, to, black, people, for, the, unpaid, labor, of, their, ancestors, he, also, rejected, the, civil, rights, movement, s, strategy, of, nonviolence, advocating, instead, that, black, people, should, defend, themselves, in, 1959, malcolm, x, visited, and, met, with, religious, leaders, at, al, aqsa, mosque, as, a, representative, of, elijah, muhammad, in, 1964, x, visited, the, khan, younis, refugee, camp, in, gaza, where, he, visited, a, local, hospital, and, dined, with, religious, leaders, in, gaza, he, also, met, palestinian, poet, harun, hashem, rashid, who, recounted, to, him, how, he, narrowly, escaped, the, khan, younis, massacre, of, 1956, a, few, weeks, later, malcolm, x, headed, to, cairo, where, he, met, with, members, of, the, palestinian, liberation, organization, these, meetings, and, experiences, inspired, malcolm, x, to, write, an, essay, entitled, zionist, logic, that, was, published, in, the, egyptian, gazette, in, this, essay, malcolm, x, explained, how, the, present, occupation, of, arab, palestine, has, no, intelligent, or, legal, basis, in, history, and, described, how, zionism, was, essentially, a, colonial, and, imperialist, project, the, ever, scheming, european, imperialists, wisely, placed, israel, where, she, could, geographically, divide, the, arab, world, infiltrate, and, sow, the, seed, of, dissension, among, african, leaders, and, also, divide, the, africans, against, the, asians, following, his, return, to, the, united, states, malcolm, x, continued, to, speak, about, the, issue, of, palestine, describing, in, 1965, in, one, of, his, speeches, in, detroit, how, we, need, a, free, palestine, we, don, t, need, a, divided, palestine, we, need, a, whole, palestine, the, common, goal, of, 22, million, afro, americans, is, respect, as, human, beings, we, can, never, get, civil, rights, in, america, until, our, human, rights, are, first, restored, we, will, never, be, recognized, as, citizens, there, until, we, are, first, recognized, as, humans, just, as, the, violation, of, human, rights, of, our, brothers, and, sisters, in, south, africa, and, angola, is, an, international, issue, and, has, brought, the, racists, of, south, africa, and, portugal, under, attack, from, all, other, independent, governments, at, the, united, nations, once, the, miserable, plight, of, the, 22, million, afro, americans, is, also, lifted, to, the, level, of, human, rights, our, struggle, then, becomes, an, international, issue, and, the, direct, concern, of, all, other, civilized, governments, we, can, then, take, the, racist, american, government, before, the, world, court, and, have, the, racists, in, it, exposed, and, condemned, as, the, criminals, that, they, are, malcolm, x, after, leaving, the, nation, of, islam, malcolm, x, announced, his, willingness, to, work, with, leaders, of, the, civil, rights, movement, though, he, advocated, some, changes, to, their, policies, he, felt, that, calling, the, movement, a, struggle, for, civil, rights, would, keep, the, issue, within, the, united, states, while, changing, the, focus, to, human, rights, would, make, it, an, international, concern, the, movement, could, then, bring, its, complaints, before, the, united, nations, where, malcolm, x, said, the, emerging, nations, of, the, world, would, add, their, support, malcolm, x, argued, that, if, the, u, s, government, was, unwilling, or, unable, to, protect, black, people, black, people, should, protect, themselves, he, said, that, he, and, the, other, members, of, the, oaau, were, determined, to, defend, themselves, from, aggressors, and, to, secure, freedom, justice, and, equality, by, whatever, means, necessary, malcolm, x, stressed, the, global, perspective, he, gained, from, his, international, travels, he, emphasized, the, direct, connection, between, the, domestic, struggle, of, african, americans, for, equal, rights, with, the, independence, struggles, of, third, world, nations, he, said, that, african, americans, were, wrong, when, they, thought, of, themselves, as, a, minority, globally, black, people, were, the, majority, in, his, speeches, at, the, militant, labor, forum, which, was, sponsored, by, the, socialist, workers, party, malcolm, x, criticized, capitalism, after, one, such, speech, when, he, was, asked, what, political, and, economic, system, he, wanted, he, said, he, did, not, know, but, that, it, was, no, coincidence, the, newly, independent, countries, in, the, third, world, were, turning, toward, socialism, when, a, reporter, asked, him, what, he, thought, about, socialism, malcolm, x, asked, whether, it, was, good, for, black, people, when, the, reporter, told, him, it, seemed, to, be, malcolm, x, told, him, then, i, m, for, it, although, he, no, longer, called, for, the, separation, of, black, people, from, white, people, malcolm, x, continued, to, advocate, black, nationalism, which, he, defined, as, self, determination, for, the, african, american, community, in, the, last, months, of, his, life, however, malcolm, x, began, to, reconsider, his, support, for, black, nationalism, after, meeting, northern, african, revolutionaries, who, to, all, appearances, were, white, after, his, hajj, malcolm, x, articulated, a, view, of, white, people, and, racism, that, represented, a, deep, change, from, the, philosophy, he, had, supported, as, a, minister, of, the, nation, of, islam, in, a, famous, letter, from, mecca, he, wrote, that, his, experiences, with, white, people, during, his, pilgrimage, convinced, him, to, rearrange, his, thinking, about, race, and, toss, aside, some, of, previous, conclusions, in, a, conversation, with, gordon, parks, two, days, before, his, assassination, malcolm, said, istening, to, leaders, like, nasser, ben, bella, and, nkrumah, awakened, me, to, the, dangers, of, racism, i, realized, racism, isn, t, just, a, black, and, white, problem, it, s, brought, bloodbaths, to, about, every, nation, on, earth, at, one, time, or, another, brother, remember, the, time, that, white, college, girls, came, into, the, restaurant, the, one, who, wanted, to, help, the, muslims, and, the, whites, get, together, and, i, told, her, there, wasn, t, a, ghost, of, a, chance, and, she, went, away, crying, well, i, ve, lived, to, regret, that, incident, in, many, parts, of, the, african, continent, i, saw, white, students, helping, black, people, something, like, this, kills, a, lot, of, argument, i, did, many, things, as, a, muslim, that, i, m, sorry, for, now, i, was, a, zombie, then, like, all, muslims, i, was, hypnotized, pointed, in, a, certain, direction, and, told, to, march, well, i, guess, a, man, s, entitled, to, make, a, fool, of, himself, if, he, s, ready, to, pay, the, cost, it, cost, me, 12, years, that, was, a, bad, scene, brother, the, sickness, and, madness, of, those, days, i, m, glad, to, be, free, of, them, in, recent, years, some, researchers, have, alleged, that, malcolm, x, was, bisexual, these, claims, are, founded, upon, the, work, of, late, columbia, university, historian, manning, marable, and, his, controversial, 2011, book, malcolm, x, a, life, of, reinvention, in, the, book, marable, asserted, that, malcolm, x, had, exaggerated, his, early, criminal, career, and, had, engaged, in, an, early, homosexual, relationship, with, a, white, businessman, scholar, christopher, phelps, agreed, with, marable, in, the, journal, of, american, studies, malcolm, little, did, take, part, in, sex, acts, with, male, counterparts, if, set, in, the, context, of, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, these, acts, position, him, not, as, a, homosexual, lover, as, has, been, asserted, but, in, the, pattern, of, straight, trade, heterosexual, men, open, to, sex, with, homosexuals, an, understanding, that, in, turn, affords, insights, into, the, black, revolutionary, s, mature, masculinity, malcolm, x, s, family, has, rejected, these, allegations, about, his, personal, life, his, daughter, ilyasah, shabazz, said, she, would, have, known, about, these, encounters, before, abruptly, walking, out, on, an, interview, on, npr, shabazz, said, i, think, the, things, that, i, take, issue, with, are, the, fact, that, he, said, my, father, engaged, in, a, bisexual, relationship, a, homo, you, know, he, had, a, gay, lover, who, was, an, elder, white, businessman, i, think, in, his, late, 50s, when, my, father, was, in, his, teens, and, you, know, my, father, was, an, open, book, and, we, actually, have, four, of, the, missing, chapters, from, the, autobiography, and, you, know, he, is, very, clear, in, his, activities, which, nothing, included, being, gay, and, certainly, he, didn, t, have, anything, against, gay, he, was, for, human, rights, human, justice, you, know, so, if, he, had, a, gay, encounter, he, likely, would, ve, talked, about, it, and, what, he, did, talk, about, was, someone, else, s, encounter, malcolm, x, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, influential, african, americans, in, history, he, is, credited, with, raising, the, self, esteem, of, black, americans, and, reconnecting, them, with, their, african, heritage, he, is, largely, responsible, for, the, spread, of, islam, in, the, black, community, in, the, united, states, many, african, americans, especially, those, who, lived, in, cities, in, the, northern, and, western, united, states, felt, that, malcolm, x, articulated, their, complaints, concerning, inequality, better, than, did, the, mainstream, civil, rights, movement, one, biographer, says, that, by, giving, expression, to, their, frustration, malcolm, x, made, clear, the, price, that, white, america, would, have, to, pay, if, it, did, not, accede, to, black, america, s, legitimate, demands, in, the, late, 1960s, increasingly, radical, black, activists, based, their, movements, largely, on, malcolm, x, and, his, teachings, the, black, power, movement, the, black, arts, movement, and, the, widespread, adoption, of, the, slogan, black, is, beautiful, can, all, trace, their, roots, to, malcolm, x, in, 1963, malcolm, x, began, a, collaboration, with, alex, haley, on, his, life, story, the, autobiography, of, malcolm, x, he, told, haley, if, i, m, alive, when,
