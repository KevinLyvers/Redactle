entirely, fictional, technology, and, psychohistory, which, is, also, used, for, a, different, study, on, historical, motivations, asimov, coined, the, term, robotics, without, suspecting, that, it, might, be, an, original, word, at, the, time, he, believed, it, was, simply, the, natural, analogue, of, words, such, as, mechanics, and, hydraulics, but, for, robots, unlike, his, word, psychohistory, the, word, robotics, continues, in, mainstream, technical, use, with, asimov, s, original, definition, star, trek, the, next, generation, featured, androids, with, positronic, brains,

family, s, candy, store, at, first, his, father, forbade, reading, pulps, until, asimov, persuaded, him, that, because, the, science, fiction, magazines, had, science, in, the, title, they, must, be, educational, at, age, 18, he, joined, the, futurians, science, fiction, fan, club, where, he, made, friends, who, went, on, to, become, science, fiction, writers, or, editors, asimov, began, writing,

its, publisher, street, smith, publications, inspired, by, the, visit, he, finished, the, story, on, june, 19, 1938, and, personally, submitted, it, to, astounding, editor, john, w, campbell, two, days, later, campbell, met, with, asimov, for, more, than, an, hour, and, promised, to, read, the, story, himself, two, days, later, he, received, a, detailed, rejection, letter, this, was, the, first, of, what, became, almost, weekly, meetings, with, the, editor, while, asimov, lived, in, new, york, until, moving, to, boston, in, 1949, campbell, had, a, strong, formative, influence, on, asimov, and, became, a, personal, friend, by, the, end, of, the, month, asimov, completed, a, second, story, stowaway, campbell, rejected, it, on, july, 22, but, in, the, nicest, possible, letter, you, could, imagine, encouraged, him, to, continue, writing, promising, that, asimov, might, sell, his, work, after, another, year, and, a, dozen, stories, of, practice, on, october, 21, 1938, he, sold, the, third, story, he, finished, marooned, off, vesta, to, amazing, stories, edited, by, raymond, a, palmer, and, it, appeared, in, the, march, 1939, issue, asimov, was, paid, 64, equivalent, to, 1, 385, in, 2023, or, one, cent, a, word, two, more, stories, appeared, that, year, the, weapon, too, dreadful, to, use, in, the, may, amazing, and, trends, in, the, july, astounding, the, issue,

his, earnings, became, enough, to, pay, for, his, education, but, not, yet, enough, for, him, to, become, a, full, time, writer, he, later, said, that, unlike, other, golden, age, writers, robert, heinlein, and, a, e, van, vogt, also, first, published, in, 1939, and, whose, talent, and, stardom, were, immediately, obvious, asimov, this, is, not, false, modesty, came, up, only, gradually, through, july, 29, 1940, asimov, wrote, 22, stories, in, 25, months, of, which, 13, were, published, he, wrote, in, 1972, that, from, that, date, he, never, wrote, a, science, fiction, story, that, was, not, published, except, for, two, special, cases, by, 1941, asimov, was, famous, enough, that, donald, wollheim, told, him, that, he, purchased, the, secret, sense, for, a, new, magazine, only, because, of, his, name, and, the, december, 1940, issue, of, astonishing, featuring, asimov, s, name, in, bold, was, the, first, magazine, to, base, cover, art, on, his, work, but, asimov, later, said, that, neither, he, nor, anyone, else, except, perhaps, campbell, considered, him, better, than, an, often, published, third, rater, based, on, a, conversation, with, campbell, asimov, wrote, nightfall, his, 32nd, story, in, march, and, april, 1941, and, astounding, published, it, in, september, 1941, in, 1968, the, science, fiction, writers, of, america, voted, nightfall, the, best, science, fiction, short, story, ever, written, in, nightfall, and, other, stories, asimov, wrote, the, writing, of, nightfall, was, a, watershed, in, my, professional, career, i, was, suddenly, taken, seriously, and, the, world, of, science, fiction, became, aware, that, i, existed, as, the, years, passed, in, fact, it, became, evident, that, i, had, written, a, classic, nightfall, is, an, archetypal, example, of, social, science, fiction, a, term, he, created, to, describe, a, new, trend, in, the, 1940s, led, by, authors, including, him, and, heinlein, away, from, gadgets, and, space, opera, and, toward, speculation, about, the, human, condition, after, writing, victory, unintentional, in, january, and, february, 1942, asimov, did, not, write, another, story, for, a, year, he, expected, to, make, chemistry, his, career, and, was, paid, 2, 600, annually, at, the, philadelphia, navy, yard, enough, to, marry, his, girlfriend, he, did, not, expect, to, make, much, more, from, writing, than, the, 1, 788, 50, he, had, earned, from, the, 28, stories, he, had, already, sold, over, four, years, asimov, left, science, fiction, fandom, and, no, longer, read, new, magazines, and, might, have, left, the, writing, profession, had, not, heinlein, and, de, camp, been, his, coworkers, at, the, navy, yard, and, previously, sold, stories, continued, to, appear, in, 1942, asimov, published, the, first, of, his, foundation, stories, later, collected, in, the, foundation, trilogy, foundation, 1951, foundation, and, empire, 1952, and, second, foundation, 1953, the, books, describe, the, fall, of, a, vast, interstellar, empire, and, the, establishment, of, its, eventual, successor, they, feature, his, fictional, science, of, psychohistory, whose, theories, could, predict, the, future, course, of, history, according, to, dynamical, laws, regarding, the, statistical, analysis, of, mass, human, actions, campbell, raised, his, rate, per, word, orson, welles, purchased, rights, to, evidence, and, anthologies, reprinted, his, stories, by, the, end, of, the, war, asimov, was, earning, as, a, writer, an, amount, equal, to, half, of, his, navy, yard, salary, even, after, a, raise, but, asimov, still, did, not, believe, that, writing, could, support, him, his, wife, and, future, children, his, positronic, robot, stories, many, of, which, were, collected, in, i, robot, 1950, were, begun, at, about, the, same, time, they, promulgated, a, set, of, rules, of, ethics, for, robots, see, three, laws, of, robotics, and, intelligent, machines, that, greatly, influenced, other, writers, and, thinkers, in, their, treatment, of, the, subject, asimov, notes, in, his, introduction, to, the, short, story, collection, the, complete, robot, 1982, that, he, was, largely, inspired, by, the, tendency, of, robots, up, to, that, time, to, fall, consistently, into, a, frankenstein, plot, in, which, they, destroyed, their, creators, the, robot, series, has, led, to, film, adaptations, with, asimov, s, collaboration, in, about, 1977, harlan, ellison, wrote, a, screenplay, of, i, robot, that, asimov, hoped, would, lead, to, the, first, really, adult, complex, worthwhile, science, fiction, film, ever, made, the, screenplay, has, never, been, filmed, and, was, eventually, published, in, book, form, in, 1994, the, 2004, movie, i, robot, starring, will, smith, was, based, on, an, unrelated, script, by, jeff, vintar, titled, hardwired, with, asimov, s, ideas, incorporated, later, after, the, rights, to, asimov, s, title, were, acquired, the, title, was, not, original, to, asimov, but, had, previously, been, used, for, a, story, by, eando, binder, also, one, of, asimov, s, robot, short, stories, the, bicentennial, man, was, expanded, into, a, novel, the, positronic, man, by, asimov, and, robert, silverberg, and, this, was, adapted, into, the, 1999, movie, bicentennial, man, starring, robin, williams, in, 1966, the, foundation, trilogy, won, the, hugo, award, for, the, all, time, best, series, of, science, fiction, and, fantasy, novels, and, they, along, with, the, robot, series, are, his, most, famous, science, fiction, besides, movies, his, foundation, and, robot, stories, have, inspired, other, derivative, works, of, science, fiction, literature, many, by, well, known, and, established, authors, such, as, roger, macbride, allen, greg, bear, gregory, benford, david, brin, and, donald, kingsbury, at, least, some, of, these, appear, to, have, been, done, with, the, blessing, of, or, at, the, request, of, asimov, s, widow, janet, asimov, in, 1948, he, also, wrote, a, spoof, chemistry, article, the, endochronic, properties, of, resublimated, thiotimoline, at, the, time, asimov, was, preparing, his, own, doctoral, dissertation, which, would, include, an, oral, examination, fearing, a, prejudicial, reaction, from, his, graduate, school, evaluation, board, at, columbia, university, asimov, asked, his, editor, that, it, be, released, under, a, pseudonym, when, it, nevertheless, appeared, under, his, own, name, asimov, grew, concerned, that, his, doctoral, examiners, might, think, he, wasn, t, taking, science, seriously, at, the, end, of, the, examination, one, evaluator, turned, to, him, smiling, and, said, what, can, you, tell, us, mr, asimov, about, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, the, compound, known, as, thiotimoline, laughing, hysterically, with, relief, asimov, had, to, be, led, out, of, the, room, after, a, five, minute, wait, he, was, summoned, back, into, the, room, and, congratulated, as, dr, asimov, demand, for, science, fiction, greatly, increased, during, the, 1950s, making, it, possible, for, a, genre, author, to, write, full, time, in, 1949, book, publisher, doubleday, s, science, fiction, editor, walter, i, bradbury, accepted, asimov, s, unpublished, grow, old, with, me, 40, 000, words, but, requested, that, it, be, extended, to, a, full, novel, of, 70, 000, words, the, book, appeared, under, the, doubleday, imprint, in, january, 1950, with, the, title, of, pebble, in, the, sky, doubleday, published, five, more, original, science, fiction, novels, by, asimov, in, the, 1950s, along, with, the, six, juvenile, lucky, starr, novels, the, latter, under, the, pseudonym, paul, french, doubleday, also, published, collections, of, asimov, s, short, stories, beginning, with, the, martian, way, and, other, stories, in, 1955, the, early, 1950s, also, saw, gnome, press, publish, one, collection, of, asimov, s, positronic, robot, stories, as, i, robot, and, his, foundation, stories, and, novelettes, as, the, three, books, of, the, foundation, trilogy, more, positronic, robot, stories, were, republished, in, book, form, as, the, rest, of, the, robots, book, publishers, and, the, magazines, galaxy, and, fantasy, science, fiction, ended, asimov, s, dependence, on, astounding, he, later, described, the, era, as, his, mature, period, asimov, s, the, last, question, 1956, on, the, ability, of, humankind, to, cope, with, and, potentially, reverse, the, process, of, entropy, was, his, personal, favorite, story, in, 1972, his, stand, alone, novel, the, gods, themselves, was, published, to, general, acclaim, winning, best, novel, in, the, hugo, nebula, and, locus, awards, in, december, 1974, former, beatle, paul, mccartney, approached, asimov, and, asked, him, to, write, the, screenplay, for, a, science, fiction, movie, musical, mccartney, had, a, vague, idea, for, the, plot, and, a, small, scrap, of, dialogue, about, a, rock, band, whose, members, discover, they, are, being, impersonated, by, extraterrestrials, the, band, and, their, impostors, would, likely, be, played, by, mccartney, s, group, wings, then, at, the, height, of, their, career, though, not, generally, a, fan, of, rock, music, asimov, was, intrigued, by, the, idea, and, quickly, produced, a, treatment, outline, of, the, story, adhering, to, mccartney, s, overall, idea, but, omitting, mccartney, s, scrap, of, dialogue, mccartney, rejected, it, and, the, treatment, now, exists, only, in, the, boston, university, archives, asimov, said, in, 1969, that, he, had, the, happiest, of, all, my, associations, with, science, fiction, magazines, with, fantasy, science, fiction, i, have, no, complaints, about, astounding, galaxy, or, any, of, the, rest, heaven, knows, but, f, sf, has, become, something, special, to, me, beginning, in, 1977, asimov, lent, his, name, to, isaac, asimov, s, science, fiction, magazine, now, asimov, s, science, fiction, and, wrote, an, editorial, for, each, issue, there, was, also, a, short, lived, asimov, s, sf, adventure, magazine, and, a, companion, asimov, s, science, fiction, anthology, reprint, series, published, as, magazines, in, the, same, manner, as, the, stablemates, ellery, queen, s, mystery, magazine, s, and, alfred, hitchcock, s, mystery, magazine, s, anthologies, due, to, pressure, by, fans, on, asimov, to, write, another, book, in, his, foundation, series, he, did, so, with, foundation, s, edge, 1982, and, foundation, and, earth, 1986, and, then, went, back, to, before, the, original, trilogy, with, prelude, to, foundation, 1988, and, forward, the, foundation, 1992, his, last, novel, just, say, i, am, one, of, the, most, versatile, writers, in, the, world, and, the, greatest, popularizer, of, many, subjects, asimov, and, two, colleagues, published, a, textbook, in, 1949, with, two, more, editions, by, 1969, during, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, asimov, substantially, decreased, his, fiction, output, he, published, only, four, adult, novels, between, 1957, s, the, naked, sun, and, 1982, s, foundation, s, edge, two, of, which, were, mysteries, he, greatly, increased, his, nonfiction, production, writing, mostly, on, science, topics, the, launch, of, sputnik, in, 1957, engendered, public, concern, over, a, science, gap, asimov, explained, in, the, rest, of, the, robots, that, he, had, been, unable, to, write, substantial, fiction, since, the, summer, of, 1958, and, observers, understood, him, as, saying, that, his, fiction, career, had, ended, or, was, permanently, interrupted, asimov, recalled, in, 1969, that, the, united, states, went, into, a, kind, of, tizzy, and, so, did, i, i, was, overcome, by, the, ardent, desire, to, write, popular, science, for, an, america, that, might, be, in, great, danger, through, its, neglect, of, science, and, a, number, of, publishers, got, an, equally, ardent, desire, to, publish, popular, science, for, the, same, reason, fantasy, and, science, fiction, invited, asimov, to, continue, his, regular, nonfiction, column, begun, in, the, now, folded, bimonthly, companion, magazine, venture, science, fiction, magazine, the, first, of, 399, monthly, f, sf, columns, appeared, in, november, 1958, and, they, continued, until, his, terminal, illness, these, columns, periodically, collected, into, books, by, doubleday, gave, asimov, a, reputation, as, a, great, explainer, of, science, he, described, them, as, his, only, popular, science, writing, in, which, he, never, had, to, assume, complete, ignorance, of, the, subjects, on, the, part, of, his, readers, the, column, was, ostensibly, dedicated, to, popular, science, but, asimov, had, complete, editorial, freedom, and, wrote, about, contemporary, social, issues, in, essays, such, as, thinking, about, thinking, and, knock, plastic, in, 1975, he, wrote, of, these, essays, i, get, more, pleasure, out, of, them, than, out, of, any, other, writing, assignment, asimov, s, first, wide, ranging, reference, work, the, intelligent, man, s, guide, to, science, 1960, was, nominated, for, a, national, book, award, and, in, 1963, he, won, a, hugo, award, his, first, for, his, essays, for, f, sf, the, popularity, of, his, science, books, and, the, income, he, derived, from, them, allowed, him, to, give, up, most, academic, responsibilities, and, become, a, full, time, freelance, writer, he, encouraged, other, science, fiction, writers, to, write, popular, science, stating, in, 1967, that, the, knowledgeable, skillful, science, writer, is, worth, his, weight, in, contracts, with, twice, as, much, work, as, he, can, possibly, handle, the, great, variety, of, information, covered, in, asimov, s, writings, prompted, kurt, vonnegut, to, ask, how, does, it, feel, to, know, everything, asimov, replied, that, he, only, knew, how, it, felt, to, have, the, reputation, of, omniscience, uneasy, floyd, c, gale, said, that, asimov, has, a, rare, talent, he, can, make, your, mental, mouth, water, over, dry, facts, and, science, fiction, s, loss, has, been, science, popularization, s, gain, asimov, said, that, of, all, the, writing, i, do, fiction, non, fiction, adult, or, juvenile, these, f, sf, articles, are, by, far, the, most, fun, he, regretted, however, that, he, had, less, time, for, fiction, causing, dissatisfied, readers, to, send, him, letters, of, complaint, stating, in, 1969, that, in, the, last, ten, years, i, ve, done, a, couple, of, novels, some, collections, a, dozen, or, so, stories, but, that, s, nothing, in, his, essay, to, tell, a, chemist, 1965, asimov, proposed, a, simple, shibboleth, for, distinguishing, chemists, from, non, chemists, ask, the, person, to, read, the, word, unionized, chemists, he, noted, will, read, un, ionized, electrically, neutral, while, non, chemists, will, read, union, ized, belonging, to, a, trade, union, asimov, coined, the, term, robotics, in, his, 1941, story, liar, though, he, later, remarked, that, he, believed, then, that, he, was, merely, using, an, existing, word, as, he, stated, in, gold, the, robot, chronicles, while, acknowledging, the, oxford, dictionary, reference, he, incorrectly, states, that, the, word, was, first, printed, about, one, third, of, the, way, down, the, first, column, of, page, 100, in, the, march, 1942, issue, of, astounding, science, fiction, the, printing, of, his, short, story, runaround, in, the, same, story, asimov, also, coined, the, term, positronic, the, counterpart, to, electronic, for, positrons, asimov, coined, the, term, psychohistory, in, his, foundation, stories, to, name, a, fictional, branch, of, science, which, combines, history, sociology, and, mathematical, statistics, to, make, general, predictions, about, the, future, behavior, of, very, large, groups, of, people, such, as, the, galactic, empire, asimov, said, later, that, he, should, have, called, it, psychosociology, it, was, first, introduced, in, the, five, short, stories, 1942, 1944, which, would, later, be, collected, as, the, 1951, fix, up, novel, foundation, somewhat, later, the, term, psychohistory, was, applied, by, others, to, research, of, the, effects, of, psychology, on, history, in, addition, to, his, interest, in, science, asimov, was, interested, in, history, starting, in, the, 1960s, he, wrote, 14, popular, history, books, including, the, greeks, a, great, adventure, 1965, the, roman, republic, 1966, the, roman, empire, 1967, the, egyptians, 1967, the, near, east, 10, 000, years, of, history, 1968, and, asimov, s, chronology, of, the, world, 1991, he, published, asimov, s, guide, to, the, bible, in, two, volumes, covering, the, old, testament, in, 1967, and, the, new, testament, in, 1969, and, then, combined, them, into, one, 1, 300, page, volume, in, 1981, complete, with, maps, and, tables, the, guide, goes, through, the, books, of, the, bible, in, order, explaining, the, history, of, each, one, and, the, political, influences, that, affected, it, as, well, as, biographical, information, about, the, important, characters, his, interest, in, literature, manifested, itself, in, several, annotations, of, literary, works, including, asimov, s, guide, to, shakespeare, 1970, asimov, s, annotated, don, juan, 1972, asimov, s, annotated, paradise, lost, 1974, and, the, annotated, gulliver, s, travels, 1980, asimov, was, also, a, noted, mystery, author, and, a, frequent, contributor, to, ellery, queen, s, mystery, magazine, he, began, by, writing, science, fiction, mysteries, such, as, his, wendell, urth, stories, but, soon, moved, on, to, writing, pure, mysteries, he, published, two, full, length, mystery, novels, and, wrote, 66, stories, about, the, black, widowers, a, group, of, men, who, met, monthly, for, dinner, conversation, and, a, puzzle, he, got, the, idea, for, the, widowers, from, his, own, association, in, a, stag, group, called, the, trap, door, spiders, and, all, of, the, main, characters, with, the, exception, of, the, waiter, henry, who, he, admitted, resembled, wodehouse, s, jeeves, were, modeled, after, his, closest, friends, a, parody, of, the, black, widowers, an, evening, with, the, white, divorc, s, was, written, by, author, critic, and, librarian, jon, l, breen, asimov, joked, all, i, can, do, is, to, wait, until, i,

limericks, which, appeared, in, 1975, limericks, too, gross, whose, title, displays, asimov, s, love, of, puns, contains, 144, limericks, by, asimov, and, an, equal, number, by, john, ciardi, he,

theory, according, to, asimov, the, most, essential, element, of, humor, is, an, abrupt, change, in, point, of, view, one, that, suddenly, shifts, focus, from, the, important, to, the, trivial, or, from, the, sublime, to, the, ridiculous, particularly, in, his, later, years, asimov, to, some, extent, cultivated, an, image, of, himself, as, an, amiable, lecher, in, 1971, as, a, response, to, the, popularity, of, sexual, guidebooks, such, as, the, sensuous, woman, by, j, and, the, sensuous, man, by, m, asimov, published, the, sensuous, dirty, old, man, under, the, byline, dr, a, although, his, full, name, was, printed, on, the, paperback, edition, first, published, 1972, however, by, 2016, asimov, s, habit, of, groping, women, was, seen, as, sexual, harassment, and, came, under, criticism, and, was, cited, as, an, early, example, of, inappropriate, behavior, that, can, occur, at, science, fiction, conventions, asimov, published, three, volumes, of, autobiography, in, memory, yet, green, 1979, and, in, joy, still, felt, 1980, cover, his, life, up, to, 1978, the, third, volume, i, asimov, a, memoir, 1994, covered, his, whole, life, rather, than, following, on, from, where, the, second,

on, star, trek, s, scientific, accuracy, for, tv, guide, magazine, roddenberry, retorted, respectfully, with, a, personal, letter, explaining, the, limitations, of, accuracy, when, writing, a, weekly,

which, means, i, tend, to, use, short, words, and, simple, sentence, structure, to, say, nothing, of, occasional, colloquialisms, this, grates, on, people, who, like, things, that, are, poetic, weighty, complex, and, above, all, obscure, on, the, other, hand, the, informal, style, pleases, people, who, enjoy, the, sensation, of, reading, an, essay, without, being, aware, that, they, are, reading, and, of, feeling, that, ideas, are, flowing, from, the, writer, s, brain, into, their, own, without, mental, friction, asimov, was, his, own, secretary, typist, indexer, proofreader, and, literary, agent, he, wrote, a, typed, first, draft, composed, at, the, keyboard, at, 90, words, per, minute, he, imagined, an, ending, first, then, a, beginning, then, let, everything, in, between, work, itself, out, as, i, come, to, it, asimov, used, an, outline, only, once, later, describing, it, as, like, trying, to, play, the, piano, from, inside, a, straitjacket, after, correcting, a, draft, by, hand, he, retyped, the, document, as, the, final, copy, and, only, made, one, revision, with, minor, editor, requested, changes, a, word, processor, did, not, save, him, much, time, asimov, said, because, 95, of, the, first, draft, was, unchanged, after, disliking, making, multiple, revisions, of, black, friar, of, the, flame, asimov, refused, to, make, major, second, or, non, editorial, revisions, like, chewing, used, gum, stating, that, too, large, a, revision, or, too, many, revisions, indicate, that, the, piece, of, writing, is, a, failure, in, the, time, it, would, take, to, salvage, such, a, failure, i, could, write, a, new, piece, altogether, and, have, infinitely, more, fun, in, the, process, he, submitted, failures, to, another, editor, asimov, s, fiction, style, is,

at, best, functional, and, the, style, is, at, best, transparent, the, robot, stories, and, as, a, matter, of, fact, almost, all, asimov, fiction, play, themselves, on, a, relatively, bare, stage, asimov, addressed, such, criticism, in, 1989, at, the, beginning, of, nemesis, i, made, up, my, mind, long, ago, to, follow, one, cardinal, rule, in, all, my, writing, to, be, clear, i, have, given, up, all, thought, of, writing, poetically, or, symbolically, or, experimentally, or, in, any, of, the, other, modes, that, might, if, i, were, good, enough, get, me, a, pulitzer, prize, i, would, write, merely, clearly, and, in, this, way, establish, a, warm, relationship, between, myself, and, my, readers, and, the, professional, critics, well, they, can, do, whatever, they, wish, gunn, cited, examples, of, a, more, complex, style, such, as, the, climax, of, liar, sharply, drawn, characters, occur, at, key, junctures, of, his, storylines, susan, calvin, in, liar, and, evidence, arkady, darell, in, second, foundation, elijah, baley, in, the, caves, of, steel, and, hari, seldon, in, the, foundation, prequels, other, than, books, by, gunn, and, joseph, patrouch, there, is, relatively, little, literary, criticism, on, asimov, particularly, when, compared, to, the, sheer, volume, of, his, output, cowart, and, wymer, s, dictionary, of, literary, biography, 1981, gives, a, possible, reason, his, words, do, not, easily, lend, themselves, to, traditional, literary, criticism, because, he, has, the, habit, of, centering, his, fiction, on, plot, and, clearly, stating, to, his, reader, in, rather, direct, terms, what, is, happening, in, his, stories, and, why, it, is, happening, in, fact, most, of, the, dialogue, in, an, asimov, story, and, particularly, in, the, foundation, trilogy, is, devoted, to, such, exposition, stories, that, clearly, state, what, they, mean, in, unambiguous, language, are, the, most, difficult, for, a, scholar, to, deal, with, because, there, is, little, to, be, interpreted, gunn, s, and, patrouch, s, studies, of, asimov, both, state, that, a, clear, direct, prose, style, is, still, a, style, gunn, s, 1982, book, comments, in, detail, on, each, of, asimov, s, novels, he, does, not, praise, all, of, asimov, s, fiction, nor, does, patrouch, but, calls, some, passages, in, the, caves, of, steel, reminiscent, of, proust, when, discussing, how, that, novel, depicts, night, falling, over, futuristic, new, york, city, gunn, says, that, asimov, s, prose, need, not, be, ashamed, anywhere, in, literary, society, although, he, prided, himself, on, his, unornamented, prose, style, for, which, he, credited, clifford, d, simak, as, an, early, influence, and, said, in, 1973, that, his, style, had, not, changed, asimov, also, enjoyed, giving, his, longer, stories, complicated, narrative, structures, often, by, arranging, chapters, in, non, chronological, ways, some, readers, have, been, put, off, by, this, complaining, that, the, nonlinearity, is, not, worth, the, trouble, and, adversely, affects, the, clarity, of, the, story, for, example, the, first, third, of, the, gods, themselves, begins, with, chapter, 6, then, backtracks, to, fill, in, earlier, material, john, campbell, advised, asimov, to, begin, his, stories, as, late, in, the, plot, as, possible, this, advice, helped, asimov, create, reason, one, of, the, early, robot, stories, patrouch, found, that, the, interwoven, and, nested, flashbacks, of, the, currents, of, space, did, serious, harm, to, that, novel, to, such, an, extent, that, only, a, dyed, in, the, kyrt, asimov, fan, could, enjoy, it, in, his, later, novel, nemesis, one, group, of, characters, lives, in, the, present, and, another, group, starts, in, the, past, beginning, 15, years, earlier, and, gradually, moving, toward, the, time, of, the, first, group, asimov, once, explained, that, his, reluctance, to, write, about, aliens, came, from, an, incident, early, in, his, career, when, astounding, s, editor, john, campbell, rejected, one, of, his, science, fiction, stories, because, the, alien, characters, were, portrayed, as, superior, to, the, humans, the, nature, of, the, rejection, led, him, to, believe, that, campbell, may, have, based, his, bias, towards, humans, in, stories, on, a, real, world, racial, bias, unwilling, to, write, only, weak, alien, races, and, concerned, that, a, confrontation, would, jeopardize, his, and, campbell, s, friendship, he, decided, he, would, not, write, about, aliens, at, all, nevertheless, in, response, to, these, criticisms, he, wrote, the, gods, themselves, which, contains, aliens, and, alien, sex, the, book, won, the, nebula, award, for, best, novel, in, 1972, and, the, hugo, award, for, best, novel, in, 1973, asimov, said, that, of, all, his, writings, he, was, most, proud, of, the, middle, section, of, the, gods, themselves, the, part, that, deals, with, those, themes, in, the, hugo, award, winning, novelette, gold, asimov, describes, an, author, based, on, himself, who, has, one, of, his, books, the, gods, themselves, adapted, into, a, compu, drama, essentially, photo, realistic, computer, animation, the, director, criticizes, the, fictionalized, asimov, gregory, laborian, for, having, an, extremely, nonvisual, style, making, it, difficult, to, adapt, his, work, and, the, author, explains, that, he, relies, on, ideas, and, dialogue, rather, than, description, to, get, his, points, across, in, the, early, days, of, science, fiction, some, authors, and, critics, felt, that, the, romantic, elements, were, inappropriate, in, science, fiction, stories, which, were, supposedly, to, be, focused, on, science, and, technology, isaac, asimov, was, a, supporter, of, this, point, of, view, expressed, in, his, 1938, 1939, letters, to, astounding, where, he, described, such, elements, as, mush, and, slop, to, his, dismay, these, letters, were, met, with, a, strong, opposition, asimov, attributed, the, lack, of, romance, and, sex, in, his, fiction, to, the, early, imprinting, from, starting, his, writing, career, when, he, had, never, been, on, a, date, and, didn, t, know, anything, about, girls, he, was, sometimes, criticized, for, the, general, absence, of, sex, and, of, extraterrestrial, life, in, his, science, fiction, he, claimed, he, wrote, the, gods, themselves, 1972, to, respond, to, these, criticisms, which, often, came, from, new, wave, science, fiction, and, often, british, writers, the, second, part, of, three, of, the, novel, is, set, on, an, alien, world, with, three, sexes, and, the, sexual, behavior, of, these, creatures, is, extensively, depicted, there, is, a, perennial, question, among, readers, as, to, whether, the, views, contained, in, a, story, reflect, the, views, of, the, author, the, answer, is, not, necessarily, and, yet, one, ought, to, add, another, short, phrase, but, usually, asimov, was, an, atheist, and, a, humanist, he, did, not, oppose, religious, conviction, in, others, but, he, frequently, railed, against, superstitious, and, pseudoscientific, beliefs, that, tried, to, pass, themselves, off, as, genuine, science, during, his, childhood, his, parents, observed, the, traditions, of, orthodox, judaism, less, stringently, than, they, had, in, petrovichi, they, did, not, force, their, beliefs, upon, young, isaac, and, he, grew, up, without, strong, religious, influences, coming, to, believe, that, the, torah, represented, hebrew, mythology, in, the, same, way, that, the, iliad, recorded, greek, mythology, when, he, was, 13, he, chose, not, to, have, a, bar, mitzvah, as, his, books, treasury, of, humor, and, asimov, laughs, again, record, asimov, was, willing, to, tell, jokes, involving, god, satan, the, garden, of, eden, jerusalem, and, other, religious, topics, expressing, the, viewpoint, that, a, good, joke, can, do, more, to, provoke, thought, than, hours, of, philosophical, discussion, for, a, brief, while, his, father, worked, in, the, local, synagogue, to, enjoy, the, familiar, surroundings, and, as, isaac, put, it, shine, as, a, learned, scholar, versed, in, the, sacred, writings, this, scholarship, was, a, seed, for, his, later, authorship, and, publication, of, asimov, s, guide, to, the, bible, an, analysis, of, the, historic, foundations, for, the, old, and, new, testaments, for, many, years, asimov, called, himself, an, atheist, he, considered, the, term, somewhat, inadequate, as, it, described, what, he, did, not, believe, rather, than, what, he, did, eventually, he, described, himself, as, a, humanist, and, considered, that, term, more, practical, asimov, continued, to, identify, himself, as, a, secular, jew, as, stated, in, his, introduction, to, jack, dann, s, anthology, of, jewish, science, fiction, wandering, stars, i, attend, no, services, and, follow, no, ritual, and, have, never, undergone, that, curious, puberty, rite, the, bar, mitzvah, it, doesn, t, matter, i, am, jewish, when, asked, in, an, interview, in, 1982, if, he, was, an, atheist, asimov, replied, i, am, an, atheist, out, and, out, it, took, me, a, long, time, to, say, it, i, ve, been, an, atheist, for, years, and, years, but, somehow, i, felt, it, was, intellectually, unrespectable, to, say, one, was, an, atheist, because, it, assumed, knowledge, that, one, didn, t, have, somehow, it, was, better, to, say, one, was, a, humanist, or, an, agnostic, i, finally, decided, that, i, m, a, creature, of, emotion, as, well, as, of, reason, emotionally, i, am, an, atheist, i, don, t, have, the, evidence, to, prove, that, god, doesn, t, exist, but, i, so, strongly, suspect, he, doesn, t, that, i, don, t, want, to, waste, my, time, likewise, he, said, about, religious, education, i, would, not, be, satisfied, to, have, my, kids, choose, to, be, religious, without, trying, to, argue, them, out, of, it, just, as, i, would, not, be, satisfied, to, have, them, decide, to, smoke, regularly, or, engage, in, any, other, practice, i, consider, detrimental, to, mind, or, body, in, his, last, volume, of, autobiography, asimov, wrote, if, i, were, not, an, atheist, i, would, believe, in, a, god, who, would, choose, to, save, people, on, the, basis, of, the, totality, of, their, lives, and, not, the, pattern, of, their, words, i, think, he, would, prefer, an, honest, and, righteous, atheist, to, a, tv, preacher, whose, every, word, is, god, god, god, and, whose, every, deed, is, foul, foul, foul, the, same, memoir, states, his, belief, that, hell, is, the, drooling, dream, of, a, sadist, crudely, affixed, to, an, all, merciful, god, if, even, human, governments, were, willing, to, curtail, cruel, and, unusual, punishments, wondered, asimov, why, would, punishment, in, the, afterlife, not, be, restricted, to, a, limited, term, asimov, rejected, the, idea, that, a, human, belief, or, action, could, merit, infinite, punishment, if, an, afterlife, existed, he, claimed, the, longest, and, most, severe, punishment, would, be, reserved, for, those, who, slandered, god, by, inventing, hell, asimov, said, about, using, religious, motifs, in, his, writing, i, tend, to, ignore, religion, in, my, own, stories, altogether, except, when, i, absolutely, have, to, have, it, and, whenever, i, bring, in, a, religious, motif, that, religion, is, bound, to, seem, vaguely, christian, because, that, is, the, only, religion, i, know, anything, about, even, though, it, is, not, mine, an, unsympathetic, reader, might, think, that, i, am, burlesquing, christianity, but, i, am, not, then, too, it, is, impossible, to, write, science, fiction, and, really, ignore, religion, asimov, became, a, staunch, supporter, of, the, democratic, party, during, the, new, deal, and, thereafter, remained, a, political, liberal, he, was, a, vocal, opponent, of, the, vietnam, war, in, the, 1960s, and, in, a, television, interview, during, the, early, 1970s, he, publicly, endorsed, george, mcgovern, he, was, unhappy, about, what, he, considered, an, irrationalist, viewpoint, taken, by, many, radical, political, activists, from, the, late, 1960s, and, onwards, in, his, second, volume, of, autobiography, in, joy, still, felt, asimov, recalled, meeting, the, counterculture, figure, abbie, hoffman, asimov, s, impression, was, that, the, 1960s, counterculture, heroes, had, ridden, an, emotional, wave, which, in, the, end, left, them, stranded, in, a, no, man, s, land, of, the, spirit, from, which, he, wondered, if, they, would, ever, return, asimov, vehemently, opposed, richard, nixon, considering, him, a, crook, and, a, liar, he, closely, followed, watergate, and, was, pleased, when, the, president, was, forced, to, resign, asimov, was, dismayed, over, the, pardon, extended, to, nixon, by, his, successor, i, was, not, impressed, by, the, argument, that, it, has, spared, the, nation, an, ordeal, to, my, way, of, thinking, the, ordeal, was, necessary, to, make, certain, it, would, never, happen, again, after, asimov, s, name, appeared, in, the, mid, 1960s, on, a, list, of, people, the, communist, party, usa, considered, amenable, to, its, goals, the, fbi, investigated, him, because, of, his, academic, background, the, bureau, briefly, considered, asimov, as, a, possible, candidate, for, known, soviet, spy, robprof, but, found, nothing, suspicious, in, his, life, or, background, asimov, appeared, to, hold, an, equivocal, attitude, towards, israel, in, his, first, autobiography, he, indicates, his, support, for, the, safety, of, israel, though, insisting, that, he, was, not, a, zionist, in, his, third, autobiography, asimov, stated, his, opposition, to, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, opposed, to, having, nation, states, in, general, and, supported, the, notion, of, a, single, humanity, asimov, especially, worried, about, the, safety, of, israel, given, that, it, had, been, created, among, muslim, neighbors, who, will, never, forgive, never, forget, and, never, go, away, and, said, that, jews, had, merely, created, for, themselves, another, jewish, ghetto, asimov, believed, that, science, fiction, serve, the, good, of, humanity, he, considered, himself, a, feminist, even, before, women, s, liberation, became, a, widespread, movement, he, argued, that, the, issue, of, women, s, rights, was, closely, connected, to, that, of, population, control, furthermore, he, believed, that, homosexuality, must, be, considered, a, moral, right, on, population, grounds, as, must, all, consenting, adult, sexual, activity, that, does, not, lead, to, reproduction, he, issued, many, appeals, for, population, control, reflecting, a, perspective, articulated, by, people, from, thomas, malthus, through, paul, r, ehrlich, in, a, 1988, interview, by, bill, moyers, asimov, proposed, computer, aided, learning, where, people, would, use, computers, to, find, information, on, subjects, in, which, they, were, interested, he, thought, this, would, make, learning, more, interesting, since, people, would, have, the, freedom, to, choose, what, to, learn, and, would, help, spread, knowledge, around, the, world, also, the, one, to, one, model, would, let, students, learn, at, their, own, pace, asimov, thought, that, people, would, live, in, space, by, 2019, in, 1983, asimov, wrote, computerization, will, undoubtedly, continue, onward, inevitably, this, means, that, a, vast, change, in, the, nature, of, education, must, take, place, and, entire, populations, must, be, made, computer, literate, and, must, be, taught, to, deal, with, a, high, tech, world, he, continues, on, education, education, which, must, be, revolutionized, in, the, new, world, will, be, revolutionized, by, the, very, agency, that, requires, the, revolution, the, computer, schools, will, undoubtedly, still, exist, but, a, good, schoolteacher, can, do, no, better, than, to, inspire, curiosity, which, an, interested, student, can, then, satisfy, at, home, at, the, console, of, his, computer, outlet, there, will, be, an, opportunity, finally, for, every, youngster, and, indeed, every, person, to, learn, what, he, or, she, wants, to, learn, in, his, or, her, own, time, at, his, or, her, own, speed, in, his, or, her, own, way, education, will, become, fun, because, it, will, bubble, up, from, within, and, not, be, forced, in, from, without, asimov, would, often, fondle, kiss, and, pinch, women, at, conventions, and, elsewhere, without, regard, for, their, consent, according, to, alec, nevala, lee, author, of, an, asimov, biography, and, writer, on, the, history, of, science, fiction, he, often, defended, himself, by, saying, that, far, from, showing, objections, these, women, cooperated, in, a, 1971, satirical, piece, the, sensuous, dirty, old, man, asimov, wrote, the, question, then, is, not, whether, or, not, a, girl, should, be, touched, the, question, is, merely, where, when, and, how, she, should, be, touched, according, to, nevala, lee, however, many, of, these, encounters, were, clearly, nonconsensual, he, wrote, that, asimov, s, behaviour, as, a, leading, science, fiction, author, and, personality, contributed, to, an, undesirable, atmosphere, for, women, in, the, male, dominated, science, fiction, community, in, support, of, this, he, quoted, some, of, asimov, s, contemporary, fellow, authors, such, as, judith, merril, harlan, ellison, and, frederik, pohl, as, well, as, editors, such, as, timothy, seldes, additional, specific, incidents, were, reported, by, other, people, including, edward, l, ferman, long, time, editor, of, the, magazine, of, fantasy, science, fiction, who, wrote, instead, of, shaking, my, date, s, hand, he, shook, her, left, breast, asimov, s, defense, of, civil, applications, of, nuclear, power, even, after, the, three, mile, island, nuclear, power, plant, incident, damaged, his, relations, with, some, of, his, fellow, liberals, in, a, letter, reprinted, in, yours, isaac, asimov, he, states, that, although, he, would, prefer, living, in, no, danger, whatsoever, to, living, near, a, nuclear, reactor, he, would, still, prefer, a, home, near, a, nuclear, power, plant, to, a, slum, on, love, canal, or, near, a, union, carbide, plant, producing, methyl, isocyanate, the, latter, being, a, reference, to, the, bhopal, disaster, in, the, closing, years, of, his, life, asimov, blamed, the, deterioration, of, the, quality, of, life, that, he, perceived, in, new, york, city, on, the, shrinking, tax, base, caused, by, the, middle, class, flight, to, the, suburbs, though, he, continued, to, support, high, taxes, on, the, middle, class, to, pay, for, social, programs, his, last, nonfiction, book, our, angry, earth, 1991, co, written, with, his, long, time, friend, science, fiction, author, frederik, pohl, deals, with, elements, of, the, environmental, crisis, such, as, overpopulation, oil, dependence, war, global, warming, and, the, destruction, of, the, ozone, layer, in, response, to, being, presented, by, bill, moyers, with, the, question, what, do, you, see, happening, to, the, idea, of, dignity, to, human, species, if, this, population, growth, continues, at, its, present, rate, asimov, responded, it, s, going, to, destroy, it, all, if, you, have, 20, people, in, the, apartment, and, two, bathrooms, no, matter, how, much, every, person, believes, in, freedom, of, the, bathroom, there, is, no, such, thing, you, have, to, set, up, you, have, to, set, up, times, for, each, person, you, have, to, bang, at, the, door, aren, t, you, through, yet, and, so, on, and, in, the, same, way, democracy, cannot, survive, overpopulation, human, dignity, cannot, survive, it, convenience, and, decency, cannot, survive, it, as, you, put, more, and, more, people, onto, the, world, the, value, of, life, not, only, declines, but, it, disappears, asimov, enjoyed, the, writings, of, j, r, r, tolkien, and, used, the, lord, of, the, rings, as, a, plot, point, in, a, black, widowers, story, titled, nothing, like, murder, in, the, essay, all, or, nothing, for, the, magazine, of, fantasy, and, science, fiction, jan, 1981, asimov, said, that, he, admired, tolkien, and, that, he, had, read, the, lord, of, the, rings, five, times, the, feelings, were, mutual, with, tolkien, saying, that, he, had, enjoyed, asimov, s, science, fiction, this, would, make, asimov, an, exception, to, tolkien, s, earlier, claim, that, he, rarely, found, any, modern, books, that, were, interesting, to, him, he, acknowledged, other, writers, as, superior, to, himself, in, talent, saying, of, harlan, ellison, he, is, in, my, opinion, one, of, the, best, writers, in, the, world, far, more, skilled, at, the, art, than, i, am, asimov, disapproved, of, the, new, wave, s, growing, influence, stating, in, 1967, i, want, science, fiction, i, think, science, fiction, isn, t, really, science, fiction, if, it, lacks, science, and, i, think, the, better, and, truer, the, science, the, better, and, truer, the, science, fiction, the, feelings, of, friendship, and, respect, between, asimov, and, arthur, c, clarke, were, demonstrated, by, the, so, called, clarke, asimov, treaty, of, park, avenue, negotiated, as, they, shared, a, cab, in, new, york, this, stated, that, asimov, was, required, to, insist, that, clarke, was, the, best, science, fiction, writer, in, the, world, reserving, second, best, for, himself, while, clarke, was, required, to, insist, that, asimov, was, the, best, science, writer, in, the, world, reserving, second, best, for, himself, thus, the, dedication, in, clarke, s, book, report, on, planet, three, 1972, reads, in, accordance, with, the, terms, of, the, clarke, asimov, treaty, the, second, best, science, writer, dedicates, this, book, to, the, second, best, science, fiction, writer, in, 1980, asimov, wrote, a, highly, critical, review, of, george, orwell, s, 1984, though, dismissive, of, his, attacks, james, machell, has, stated, that, they, are, easier, to, understand, when, you, consider, that, asimov, viewed, 1984, as, dangerous, literature, he, opines, that, if, communism, were, to, spread, across, the, globe, it, would, come, in, a, completely, different, form, to, the, one, in, 1984, and, by, looking, to, orwell, as, an, authority, on, totalitarianism, we, will, be, defending, ourselves, against, assaults, from, the, wrong, direction, and, we, will, lose, asimov, became, a, fan, of, mystery, stories, at, the, same, time, as, science, fiction, he, preferred, to, read, the, former, because, i, read, every, story, keenly, aware, that, it, might, be, worse, than, mine, in, which, case, i, had, no, patience, with, it, or, that, it, might, be, better, in, which, case, i, felt, miserable, asimov, wrote, i, make, no, secret, of, the, fact, that, in, my, mysteries, i, use, agatha, christie, as, my, model, in, my, opinion, her, mysteries, are, the, best, ever, written, far, better, than, the, sherlock, holmes, stories, and, hercule, poirot, is, the, best, detective, fiction, has, seen, why, should, i, not, use, as, my, model, what, i, consider, the, best, he, enjoyed, sherlock, holmes, but, considered, arthur, conan, doyle, to, be, a, slapdash, and, sloppy, writer, asimov, also, enjoyed, humorous, stories, particularly, those, of, p, g, wodehouse, in, non, fiction, writing, asimov, particularly, admired, the, writing, style, of, martin, gardner, and, tried, to, emulate, it, in, his, own, science, books, on, meeting, gardner, for, the, first, time, in, 1965, asimov, told, him, this, to, which, gardner, answered, that, he, had, based, his, own, style, on, asimov, s, paul, krugman, holder, of, a, nobel, prize, in, economics, stated, asimov, s, concept, of, psychohistory, inspired, him, to, become, an, economist, john, jenkins, who, has, reviewed, the, vast, majority, of, asimov, s, written, output, once, observed, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, most, science, fiction, writers, since, the, 1950s, have, been, affected, by, asimov, either, modeling, their, style, on, his, or, deliberately, avoiding, anything, like, his, style, along, with, such, figures, as, bertrand, russell, and, karl, popper, asimov, left, his, mark, as, one, of, the, most, distinguished, interdisciplinarians, of, the, 20th, century, few, individuals, writes, james, l, christian, understood, better, than, isaac, asimov, what, synoptic, thinking, is, all, about, his, almost, 500, books, which, he, wrote, as, a, specialist, a, knowledgeable, authority, or, just, an, excited, layman, range, over, almost, all, conceivable, subjects, the, sciences, history, literature, religion, and, of, course, science,
