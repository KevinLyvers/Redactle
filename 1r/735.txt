plotinus, p, l, t, a, n, s, greek, pl, t, nos, c, 204, 5, 270, ce, was, a, greek, platonist, philosopher, born, and, raised, in, roman, egypt, plotinus, is, regarded, by, modern, scholarship, as, the, founder, of, neoplatonism, his, teacher, was, the, self, taught, philosopher, ammonius, saccas, who, belonged, to, the, platonic, tradition, historians, of, the, 19th, century, invented, the, term, neoplatonism, and, applied, it, to, refer, to, plotinus, and, his, philosophy, which, was, vastly, influential, during, late, antiquity, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, much, of, the, biographical, information, about, plotinus, comes, from, porphyry, s, preface, to, his, edition, of, plotinus, most, notable, literary, work, the, enneads, in, his, metaphysical, writings, plotinus, described, three, fundamental, principles, the, one, the, intellect, and, the, soul, his, works, have, inspired, centuries, of, pagan, jewish, christian, gnostic, and, early, islamic, metaphysicians, and, mystics, including, developing, precepts, that, influence, mainstream, theological, concepts, within, religions, such, as, his, work, on, duality, of, the, one, in, two, metaphysical, states, porphyry, reported, that, plotinus, was, sixty, six, years, old, when, he, died, in, 270, ce, the, second, year, of, the, reign, of, the, roman, emperor, claudius, ii, thus, giving, us, the, year, of, his, birth, as, around, 204, eunapius, reported, that, plotinus, was, born, in, lyco, which, could, either, refer, to, the, modern, asyut, in, upper, egypt, or, deltaic, lycopolis, in, lower, egypt, this, has, led, to, speculations, that, his, family, was, either, hellenized, egyptian, greek, or, roman, historian, lloyd, p, gerson, states, that, plotinus, was, almost, certainly, a, greek, a, h, armstrong, one, of, the, foremost, authorities, on, the, philosophical, teachings, of, plotinus, writes, that, all, that, can, be, said, with, reasonable, certainty, is, that, greek, was, his, normal, language, and, that, he, had, a, greek, education, plotinus, himself, was, said, to, have, had, little, interest, in, his, ancestry, birthplace, or, that, of, anyone, else, for, that, matter, his, native, language, was, greek, plotinus, had, an, inherent, distrust, of, materiality, an, attitude, common, to, platonism, holding, to, the, view, that, phenomena, were, a, poor, image, or, mimicry, mimesis, of, something, higher, and, intelligible, vi, i, which, was, the, truer, part, of, genuine, being, this, distrust, extended, to, the, body, including, his, own, it, is, reported, by, porphyry, that, at, one, point, he, refused, to, have, his, portrait, painted, presumably, for, much, the, same, reasons, of, dislike, likewise, plotinus, never, discussed, his, ancestry, childhood, or, his, place, or, date, of, birth, from, all, accounts, his, personal, and, social, life, exhibited, the, highest, moral, and, spiritual, standards, plotinus, took, up, the, study, of, philosophy, at, the, age, of, twenty, eight, around, the, year, 232, and, travelled, to, alexandria, to, study, there, he, was, dissatisfied, with, every, teacher, he, encountered, until, an, acquaintance, suggested, he, listen, to, the, ideas, of, the, self, taught, platonist, philosopher, ammonius, saccas, upon, hearing, ammonius, lecture, plotinus, declared, to, his, friend, this, is, the, man, i, was, looking, for, began, to, study, intently, under, his, new, instructor, and, remained, with, him, as, his, student, for, eleven, years, besides, ammonius, plotinus, was, also, influenced, by, the, philosophical, works, of, aristotle, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, empedocles, and, heraclitus, the, middle, platonist, philosophers, alexander, of, aphrodisias, and, numenius, of, apamea, along, with, various, stoics, and, neopythagoreans, after, having, spent, eleven, years, in, alexandria, he, then, decided, at, the, age, of, around, thirty, eight, to, investigate, the, philosophical, teachings, of, the, persian, and, indian, philosophers, in, the, pursuit, of, this, endeavor, he, left, alexandria, and, joined, the, army, of, the, roman, emperor, gordian, iii, as, it, marched, on, persia, 242, 243, however, the, campaign, was, a, failure, and, on, gordian, s, eventual, death, plotinus, found, himself, abandoned, in, a, hostile, land, and, only, with, difficulty, found, his, way, back, to, safety, in, antioch, at, the, age, of, forty, during, the, reign, of, emperor, philip, the, arab, he, came, to, rome, where, he, stayed, for, most, of, the, remainder, of, his, life, there, he, attracted, a, number, of, students, his, innermost, circle, included, porphyry, amelius, gentilianus, of, tuscany, the, senator, castricius, firmus, and, eustochius, of, alexandria, a, doctor, who, devoted, himself, to, learning, from, plotinus, and, attending, to, him, until, his, death, other, students, included, zethos, an, arab, by, ancestry, who, died, before, plotinus, leaving, him, a, legacy, and, some, land, zoticus, a, critic, and, poet, paulinus, a, doctor, of, scythopolis, and, serapion, from, alexandria, he, had, students, amongst, the, roman, senate, beside, castricius, such, as, marcellus, orontius, sabinillus, and, rogantianus, women, were, also, numbered, amongst, his, students, including, gemina, in, whose, house, he, lived, during, his, residence, in, rome, and, her, daughter, also, gemina, and, amphiclea, the, wife, of, ariston, the, son, of, iamblichus, finally, plotinus, was, a, correspondent, of, the, philosopher, cassius, longinus, while, in, rome, plotinus, also, gained, the, respect, of, the, emperor, gallienus, and, his, wife, salonina, at, one, point, plotinus, attempted, to, interest, gallienus, in, rebuilding, an, abandoned, settlement, in, campania, known, as, the, city, of, philosophers, where, the, inhabitants, would, live, under, the, constitution, set, out, in, plato, s, laws, an, imperial, subsidy, was, never, granted, for, reasons, unknown, to, porphyry, who, reports, the, incident, plotinus, subsequently, went, to, live, in, sicily, he, spent, his, final, days, in, seclusion, on, an, estate, in, campania, which, his, friend, zethos, had, bequeathed, him, according, to, the, account, of, eustochius, who, attended, him, at, the, end, plotinus, final, words, were, try, to, raise, the, divine, in, yourselves, to, the, divine, in, the, all, eustochius, records, that, a, snake, crept, under, the, bed, where, plotinus, lay, and, slipped, away, through, a, hole, in, the, wall, at, the, same, moment, the, philosopher, died, plotinus, wrote, the, essays, that, became, the, enneads, from, greek, enn, a, or, group, of, nine, over, a, period, of, several, years, from, c, 253, until, a, few, months, before, his, death, seventeen, years, later, porphyry, makes, note, that, the, enneads, before, being, compiled, and, arranged, by, himself, were, merely, the, enormous, collection, of, notes, and, essays, which, plotinus, used, in, his, lectures, and, debates, rather, than, a, formal, book, plotinus, was, unable, to, revise, his, own, work, due, to, his, poor, eyesight, yet, his, writings, required, extensive, editing, according, to, porphyry, his, master, s, handwriting, was, atrocious, he, did, not, properly, separate, his, words, and, he, cared, little, for, niceties, of, spelling, plotinus, intensely, disliked, the, editorial, process, and, turned, the, task, to, porphyry, who, polished, and, edited, them, into, their, modern, form, plotinus, taught, that, there, is, a, supreme, totally, transcendent, one, containing, no, division, multiplicity, or, distinction, beyond, all, categories, of, being, and, non, being, his, one, cannot, be, any, existing, thing, nor, is, it, merely, the, sum, of, all, things, compare, the, stoic, doctrine, of, disbelief, in, non, material, existence, but, is, prior, to, all, existents, plotinus, identified, his, one, with, the, concept, of, good, and, the, principle, of, beauty, i, 6, 9, his, one, concept, encompassed, thinker, and, object, even, the, self, contemplating, intelligence, the, noesis, of, the, nous, must, contain, duality, once, you, have, uttered, the, good, add, no, further, thought, by, any, addition, and, in, proportion, to, that, addition, you, introduce, a, deficiency, iii, 8, 11, plotinus, denies, sentience, self, awareness, or, any, other, action, ergon, to, the, one, to, hen, v, 6, 6, rather, if, we, insist, on, describing, it, further, we, must, call, the, one, a, sheer, potentiality, dynamis, without, which, nothing, could, exist, iii, 8, 10, as, plotinus, explains, in, both, places, and, elsewhere, e, g, v, 6, 3, it, is, impossible, for, the, one, to, be, being, or, a, self, aware, creator, god, at, v, 6, 4, plotinus, compared, the, one, to, light, the, divine, intellect, nous, nous, first, will, towards, good, to, the, sun, and, lastly, the, soul, psyche, to, the, moon, whose, light, is, merely, a, derivative, conglomeration, of, light, from, the, sun, the, first, light, could, exist, without, any, celestial, body, the, one, being, beyond, all, attributes, including, being, and, non, being, is, the, source, of, the, world, but, not, through, any, act, of, creation, since, activity, cannot, be, ascribed, to, the, unchangeable, immutable, one, plotinus, argues, instead, that, the, multiple, cannot, exist, without, the, simple, the, less, perfect, must, of, necessity, emanate, or, issue, forth, from, the, perfect, or, more, perfect, thus, all, of, creation, emanates, from, the, one, in, succeeding, stages, of, lesser, and, lesser, perfection, these, stages, are, not, temporally, isolated, but, occur, throughout, time, as, a, constant, process, the, one, is, not, just, an, intellectual, concept, but, something, that, can, be, experienced, an, experience, where, one, goes, beyond, all, multiplicity, plotinus, writes, we, ought, not, even, to, say, that, he, will, see, but, he, will, be, that, which, he, sees, if, indeed, it, is, possible, any, longer, to, distinguish, between, seer, and, seen, and, not, boldly, to, affirm, that, the, two, are, one, although, plotinus, never, mentions, christianity, in, any, of, his, works, he, seems, to, offer, an, alternative, to, the, orthodox, christian, notion, of, creation, ex, nihilo, out, of, nothing, though, this, is, disputed, the, metaphysics, of, emanation, aporrhoe, 3, 2, or, aporrhoia, ii, 3, 11, literally, a, flowing, forth, similar, to, the, metaphysics, of, creation, describes, the, absolute, transcendence, of, the, one, or, of, the, divine, as, the, source, of, the, being, of, all, things, but, which, remains, transcendent, of, them, in, its, own, nature, the, one, is, in, no, way, affected, or, diminished, by, these, emanations, just, as, the, christian, god, in, no, way, is, augmented, or, diminished, by, the, act, of, creation, plotinus, using, a, venerable, analogy, that, would, become, crucial, for, the, largely, neoplatonic, metaphysics, of, developed, christian, thought, likens, the, one, to, the, sun, which, emanates, light, indiscriminately, without, thereby, diminishing, itself, or, reflection, in, a, mirror, which, in, no, way, diminishes, or, otherwise, alters, the, object, being, reflected, the, first, emanation, is, nous, divine, mind, logos, order, thought, reason, identified, metaphorically, with, the, demiurge, in, plato, s, timaeus, it, is, the, first, will, toward, good, from, nous, proceeds, the, world, soul, which, plotinus, subdivides, into, upper, and, lower, identifying, the, lower, aspect, of, soul, with, nature, from, the, world, soul, proceeds, individual, human, souls, and, finally, matter, at, the, lowest, level, of, being, and, thus, the, least, perfected, level, of, the, cosmos, plotinus, asserted, the, ultimately, divine, nature, of, material, creation, since, it, ultimately, derives, from, the, one, through, the, mediums, of, nous, and, the, world, soul, it, is, by, the, good, or, through, beauty, that, we, recognize, the, one, in, material, things, and, then, in, the, forms, i, 6, 6, and, i, 6, 9, the, essentially, devotional, nature, of, plotinus, philosophy, may, be, further, illustrated, by, his, concept, of, attaining, ecstatic, union, with, the, one, henosis, porphyry, relates, that, plotinus, attained, such, a, union, four, times, during, the, years, he, knew, him, this, may, be, related, to, enlightenment, liberation, and, other, concepts, of, mysticism, common, to, many, eastern, traditions, the, philosophy, of, plotinus, has, always, exerted, a, peculiar, fascination, upon, those, whose, discontent, with, things, as, they, are, has, led, them, to, seek, the, realities, behind, what, they, took, to, be, merely, the, appearances, of, the, sense, the, philosophy, of, plotinus, representative, books, from, the, enneads, p, vii, authentic, human, happiness, for, plotinus, consists, of, the, true, human, identifying, with, that, which, is, the, best, in, the, universe, because, happiness, is, beyond, anything, physical, plotinus, stresses, the, point, that, worldly, fortune, does, not, control, true, human, happiness, and, thus, there, exists, no, single, human, being, that, does, not, either, potentially, or, effectively, possess, this, thing, we, hold, to, constitute, happiness, enneads, i, 4, 4, the, issue, of, happiness, is, one, of, plotinus, greatest, imprints, on, western, thought, as, he, is, one, of, the, first, to, introduce, the, idea, that, eudaimonia, happiness, is, attainable, only, within, consciousness, the, true, human, is, an, incorporeal, contemplative, capacity, of, the, soul, and, superior, to, all, things, corporeal, it, then, follows, that, real, human, happiness, is, independent, of, the, physical, world, real, happiness, is, instead, dependent, on, the, metaphysical, and, authentic, human, being, found, in, this, highest, capacity, of, reason, for, man, and, especially, the, proficient, is, not, the, couplement, of, soul, and, body, the, proof, is, that, man, can, be, disengaged, from, the, body, and, disdain, its, nominal, goods, enneads, i, 4, 14, the, human, who, has, achieved, happiness, will, not, be, bothered, by, sickness, discomfort, etc, as, his, focus, is, on, the, greatest, things, authentic, human, happiness, is, the, utilization, of, the, most, authentically, human, capacity, of, contemplation, even, in, daily, physical, action, the, flourishing, human, s, act, is, determined, by, the, higher, phase, of, the, soul, enneads, iii, 4, 6, even, in, the, most, dramatic, arguments, plotinus, considers, if, the, proficient, is, subject, to, extreme, physical, torture, for, example, he, concludes, this, only, strengthens, his, claim, of, true, happiness, being, metaphysical, as, the, truly, happy, human, being, would, understand, that, which, is, being, tortured, is, merely, a, body, not, the, conscious, self, and, happiness, could, persist, plotinus, offers, a, comprehensive, description, of, his, conception, of, a, person, who, has, achieved, eudaimonia, the, perfect, life, involves, a, man, who, commands, reason, and, contemplation, enneads, i, 4, 4, a, happy, person, will, not, sway, between, happy, and, sad, as, many, of, plotinus, contemporaries, believed, stoics, for, example, question, the, ability, of, someone, to, be, happy, presupposing, happiness, is, contemplation, if, they, are, mentally, incapacitated, or, even, asleep, plotinus, disregards, this, claim, as, the, soul, and, true, human, do, not, sleep, or, even, exist, in, time, nor, will, a, living, human, who, has, achieved, eudaimonia, suddenly, stop, using, its, greatest, most, authentic, capacity, just, because, of, the, body, s, discomfort, in, the, physical, realm, the, proficient, s, will, is, set, always, and, only, inward, enneads, i, 4, 11, overall, happiness, for, plotinus, is, a, flight, from, this, world, s, ways, and, things, theaet, 176, and, a, focus, on, the, highest, i, e, forms, and, the, one, plotinus, regarded, happiness, as, living, in, an, interior, way, interiority, or, self, sufficiency, and, this, being, the, obverse, of, attachment, to, the, objects, of, embodied, desires, henosis, is, the, word, for, mystical, oneness, union, or, unity, in, classical, greek, in, platonism, and, especially, neoplatonism, the, goal, of, henosis, is, union, with, what, is, fundamental, in, reality, the, one, the, source, or, monad, as, is, specified, in, the, writings, of, plotinus, on, henology, one, can, reach, a, state, of, tabula, rasa, blank, state, where, the, individual, may, grasp, or, merge, with, the, one, this, absolute, simplicity, means, that, the, nous, or, the, person, is, then, dissolved, completely, absorbed, back, into, the, monad, here, within, the, enneads, of, plotinus, the, monad, can, be, referred, to, as, the, good, above, the, demiurge, the, monad, or, dunamis, force, is, of, one, singular, expression, the, will, or, the, one, which, is, the, good, all, is, contained, in, the, monad, and, the, monad, is, all, pantheism, all, division, is, reconciled, in, the, one, the, final, stage, before, reaching, singularity, called, duality, dyad, is, completely, reconciled, in, the, monad, source, or, one, see, monism, as, the, one, source, or, substance, of, all, things, the, monad, is, all, encompassing, as, infinite, and, indeterminate, all, is, reconciled, in, the, dunamis, or, one, it, is, the, demiurge, or, second, emanation, that, is, the, nous, in, plotinus, it, is, the, demiurge, creator, action, energy, or, nous, that, perceives, and, therefore, causes, the, force, potential, or, one, to, manifest, as, energy, or, the, dyad, called, the, material, world, nous, as, being, being, and, perception, intellect, manifest, what, is, called, soul, world, soul, henosis, for, plotinus, was, defined, in, his, works, as, a, reversing, of, the, ontological, process, of, consciousness, via, meditation, in, the, western, mind, to, un, contemplate, toward, no, thought, nous, or, demiurge, and, no, division, dyad, within, the, individual, being, plotinus, words, his, teachings, to, reconcile, not, only, plato, with, aristotle, but, also, various, world, religions, that, he, had, personal, contact, with, during, his, various, travels, plotinus, works, have, an, ascetic, character, in, that, they, reject, matter, as, an, illusion, non, existent, matter, was, strictly, treated, as, immanent, with, matter, as, essential, to, its, being, having, no, true, or, transcendential, character, or, essence, substance, or, ousia, this, approach, is, called, philosophical, idealism, for, several, centuries, after, the, protestant, reformation, neoplatonism, was, condemned, as, a, decadent, and, oriental, distortion, of, platonism, in, a, 1929, essay, e, r, dodds, showed, that, key, conceptions, of, neoplatonism, could, be, traced, from, their, origin, in, plato, s, dialogues, through, his, immediate, followers, e, g, speusippus, and, the, neopythagoreans, to, plotinus, and, the, neoplatonists, thus, plotinus, philosophy, was, he, argued, not, the, starting, point, of, neoplatonism, but, its, intellectual, culmination, further, research, reinforced, this, view, and, by, 1954, merlan, could, say, the, present, tendency, is, toward, bridging, rather, than, widening, the, gap, separating, platonism, from, neoplatonism, since, the, 1950s, the, t, bingen, school, of, plato, interpretation, has, argued, that, the, so, called, unwritten, doctrines, of, plato, debated, by, aristotle, and, the, old, academy, strongly, resemble, plotinus, s, metaphysics, in, this, case, the, neoplatonic, reading, of, plato, would, be, at, least, in, this, central, area, historically, justified, this, implies, that, neoplatonism, is, less, of, an, innovation, than, it, appears, without, the, recognition, of, plato, s, unwritten, doctrines, advocates, of, the, t, bingen, school, emphasize, this, advantage, of, their, interpretation, they, see, plotinus, as, advancing, a, tradition, of, thought, begun, by, plato, himself, plotinus, s, metaphysics, at, least, in, broad, outline, was, therefore, already, familiar, to, the, first, generation, of, plato, s, students, this, confirms, plotinus, own, view, for, he, considered, himself, not, the, inventor, of, a, system, but, the, faithful, interpreter, of, plato, s, doctrines, at, least, two, modern, conferences, within, hellenic, philosophy, fields, of, study, have, been, held, in, order, to, address, what, plotinus, stated, in, his, tract, against, the, gnostics, and, to, whom, he, was, addressing, it, in, order, to, separate, and, clarify, the, events, and, persons, involved, in, the, origin, of, the, term, gnostic, from, the, dialogue, it, appears, that, the, word, had, an, origin, in, the, platonic, and, hellenistic, tradition, long, before, the, group, calling, themselves, gnostics, or, the, group, covered, under, the, modern, term, gnosticism, ever, appeared, it, would, seem, that, this, shift, from, platonic, to, gnostic, usage, has, led, many, people, to, confusion, the, strategy, of, sectarians, taking, greek, terms, from, philosophical, contexts, and, re, applying, them, to, religious, contexts, was, popular, in, christianity, the, cult, of, isis, and, other, ancient, religious, contexts, including, hermetic, ones, see, alexander, of, abonutichus, for, an, example, according, to, a, h, armstrong, plotinus, and, the, neoplatonists, viewed, gnosticism, as, a, form, of, heresy, or, sectarianism, to, the, pythagorean, and, platonic, philosophy, of, the, mediterranean, and, middle, east, also, according, to, armstrong, plotinus, accused, them, of, using, senseless, jargon, and, being, overly, dramatic, and, insolent, in, their, distortion, of, plato, s, ontology, armstrong, argues, that, plotinus, attacks, his, opponents, as, untraditional, irrational, and, immoral, and, arrogant, armstrong, believed, that, plotinus, also, attacks, them, as, elitist, and, blasphemous, to, plato, for, the, gnostics, despising, the, material, world, and, its, maker, for, decades, armstrong, s, was, the, only, translation, available, of, plotinus, for, this, reason, his, claims, were, authoritative, however, a, modern, translation, by, lloyd, p, gerson, doesn, t, necessarily, support, all, of, armstrong, s, views, unlike, armstrong, gerson, didn, t, find, plotinus, to, be, so, vitriolic, against, the, gnostics, according, to, gerson, as, plotinus, himself, tells, us, at, the, time, of, this, treatise, s, composition, some, of, his, friends, were, attached, to, gnostic, doctrine, and, he, believed, that, this, attachment, was, harmful, so, he, sets, out, here, a, number, of, objections, and, corrections, some, of, these, are, directed, at, very, specific, tenets, of, gnosticism, e, g, the, introduction, of, a, new, earth, or, a, principle, of, wisdom, but, the, general, thrust, of, this, treatise, has, a, much, broader, scope, the, gnostics, are, very, critical, of, the, sensible, universe, and, its, contents, and, as, a, platonist, plotinus, must, share, this, critical, attitude, to, some, extent, but, here, he, makes, his, case, that, the, proper, understanding, of, the, highest, principles, and, emanation, forces, us, to, respect, the, sensible, world, as, the, best, possible, imitation, of, the, intelligible, world, plotinus, seems, to, direct, his, attacks, at, a, very, specific, sect, of, gnostics, most, notably, a, sect, of, gnostics, that, held, anti, polytheistic, and, anti, daemon, views, and, that, preached, salvation, was, possible, without, struggle, at, one, point, plotinus, makes, clear, that, his, major, grudge, is, the, way, gnostics, misused, plato, s, teachings, and, not, their, own, teachings, themselves, there, are, no, hard, feelings, if, they, tell, us, in, which, respects, they, intend, to, disagree, with, plato, rather, whatever, strikes, them, as, their, own, distinct, views, in, comparison, with, the, greeks, these, views, as, well, as, the, views, that, contradict, them, should, be, forthrightly, set, out, on, their, own, in, a, considerate, and, philosophical, manner, the, neoplatonic, movement, though, plotinus, would, have, simply, referred, to, himself, as, a, philosopher, of, plato, seems, to, be, motivated, by, the, desire, of, plotinus, to, revive, the, pagan, philosophical, tradition, plotinus, was, not, claiming, to, innovate, with, the, enneads, but, to, clarify, aspects, of, the, works, of, plato, that, he, considered, misrepresented, or, misunderstood, plotinus, does, not, claim, to, be, an, innovator, but, rather, a, communicator, of, a, tradition, plotinus, referred, to, tradition, as, a, way, to, interpret, plato, s, intentions, because, the, teachings, of, plato, were, for, members, of, the, academy, rather, than, the, general, public, it, was, easy, for, outsiders, to, misunderstand, plato, s, meaning, however, plotinus, attempted, to, clarify, how, the, philosophers, of, the, academy, had, not, arrived, at, the, same, conclusions, such, as, misotheism, or, dystheism, of, the, creator, god, as, an, answer, to, the, problem, of, evil, as, the, targets, of, his, criticism, plotinus, seems, to, be, one, of, the, first, to, have, argued, against, the, then, popular, notion, of, causal, astrology, in, the, late, tractate, 2, 3, are, the, stars, causes,
