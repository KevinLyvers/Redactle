later, reservations, called, mahaffy, my, first, and, best, teacher, and, the, scholar, who, showed, me, how, to, love, greek, things, for, his, part, mahaffy, boasted, of, having, created, wilde, later, he, said, wilde, was, the, only, blot, on, my, tutorship, the, university, philosophical, society, also, provided, an, education, as, members, discussed, intellectual, and, artistic, subjects,

petitioned, the, apollo, masonic, lodge, at, oxford, and, was, soon, raised, to, the, sublime, degree, of, master, mason, during, a, resurgent, interest, in, freemasonry, in, his, third, year, he, commented, he, would, be, awfully, sorry, to, give, it, up, if, i, secede, from, the, protestant, heresy, wilde, s, active, involvement, in, freemasonry, lasted, only, for, the, time, he, spent, at, oxford, he, allowed, his, membership, of, the, apollo, university, lodge, to, lapse, after, failing, to, pay, subscriptions, catholicism, deeply, appealed, to, him, especially, its, rich, liturgy, and, he, discussed, converting, to, it, with, clergy, several, times, in, 1877, wilde, was, left, speechless, after, an, audience, with, pope, pius, ix, in, rome, he, eagerly, read, the, books, of, cardinal, newman, a, noted, anglican, priest, who, had, converted, to, catholicism, and, risen, in, the, church, hierarchy, he, became, more, serious, in, 1878, when, he, met, the, reverend, sebastian, bowden, a, priest, in, the, brompton, oratory, who, had, received, some, high, profile, converts, neither, mahaffy, nor, sir, william, who, threatened, to, cut, off, his, son, s, funding, thought, much, of, the, plan, but, wilde, the, supreme, individualist, balked, at, the, last, minute, from, pledging, himself, to, any, formal, creed, and, on, the, appointed, day, of, his, baptism, into, catholicism, he, sent, father, bowden, a, bunch, of, altar, lilies, instead, wilde, did, retain, a, lifelong, interest, in, catholic, theology, and, liturgy, while, at, magdalen, college, wilde, became, well, known, for, his, role, in, the, aesthetic, and, decadent, movements, he, wore, his, hair, long, openly, scorned, manly, sports, though, he, occasionally, boxed, and, decorated, his, rooms, with, peacock, feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue, china, and, other, objets, d, art, he, entertained, lavishly, and, once, remarked, to, some, friends, i, find, it, harder, and, harder, every, day, to, live, up, to, my, blue, china, the, line, spread, famously, aesthetes, adopted, it, as, a, slogan, but, it, was, criticized, as, being, terribly, vacuous, some, elements, disdained, the, aesthetes, but, their, languorous, attitudes, and, showy, costumes, became, a, recognisable, pose, when, four, of, his, fellow, students, physically, assaulted, wilde, he, fended, them, off, single, handedly, to, the, surprise, of, his, detractors, by, his, third, year, wilde, had, truly, begun, to, develop, himself, and, his, myth, and, considered, his, learning, to, be, more, expansive, than, what, was, within, the, prescribed, texts, he, was, rusticated, for, one, term, after, he, had, returned, late, to, a, college, term, from, a, trip, to, greece, with, mahaffy, wilde, did, not, meet, walter, pater, until, his, third, year, but, had, been, enthralled, by, his, studies, in, the, history, of, the, renaissance, published, during, wilde, s, final, year, in, trinity, pater, argued, that, man, s, sensibility, to, beauty, should, be, refined, above, all, else, and, that, each, moment, should, be, felt, to, its, fullest, extent, years, later, in, de, profundis, wilde, described, pater, s, studies, as, that, book, that, has, had, such, a, strange, influence, over, my, life, he, learned, tracts, of, the, book, by, heart, and, carried, it, with, him, on, travels, in, later, years, pater, gave, wilde, his, sense, of, almost, flippant, devotion, to, art, though, he, gained, a, purpose, for, it, through, the, lectures, and, writings, of, critic, john, ruskin, ruskin, despaired, at, the, self, validating, aestheticism, of, pater, arguing, that, the, importance, of, art, lies, in, its, potential, for, the, betterment, of, society, ruskin, admired, beauty, but, believed, it, must, be, allied, with, and, applied, to, moral, good, when, wilde, eagerly, attended, ruskin, s, lecture, series, the, aesthetic, and, mathematic, schools, of, art, in, florence, he, learned, about, aesthetics, as, the, non, mathematical, elements, of, painting, despite, being, given, to, neither, early, rising, nor, manual, labour, wilde, volunteered, for, ruskin, s, project, to, convert, a, swampy, country, lane, into, a, smart, road, neatly, edged, with, flowers, wilde, won, the, 1878, newdigate, prize, for, his, poem, ravenna, which, reflected, on, his, visit, there, in, the, previous, year, and, he, duly, read, it, at, encaenia, in, november, 1878, he, graduated, bachelor, of, arts, with, a, double, first, having, been, placed, in, the, first, class, in, classical, moderations, the, first, part, of, the, course, and, then, again, in, the, final, examination, in, literae, humaniores, greats, wilde, wrote, to, a, friend, the, dons, are, astonied, beyond, words, the, bad, boy, doing, so, well, in, the, end, after, graduation, from, oxford, wilde, returned, to, dublin, where, he, met, again, florence, balcombe, a, childhood, sweetheart, she, became, engaged, to, bram, stoker, and, they, married, in, 1878, wilde, was, disappointed, but, stoic, he, wrote, to, balcombe, remembering, the, two, sweet, years, the, sweetest, years, of, all, my, youth, during, which, they, had, been, close, he, also, stated, his, intention, to, return, to, england, probably, for, good, this, he, did, in, 1878, only, briefly, visiting, ireland, twice, after, that, unsure, of, his, next, step, wilde, wrote, to, various, acquaintances, enquiring, about, classics, positions, at, oxford, or, cambridge, the, rise, of, historical, criticism, was, his, submission, for, the, chancellor, s, essay, prize, of, 1879, which, though, no, longer, a, student, he, was, still, eligible, to, enter, its, subject, historical, criticism, among, the, ancients, seemed, ready, made, for, wilde, with, both, his, skill, in, composition, and, ancient, learning, but, he, struggled, to, find, his, voice, in, the, long, flat, scholarly, style, unusually, no, prize, was, awarded, that, year, with, the, last, of, his, inheritance, from, the, sale, of, his, father, s, houses, he, set, himself, up, as, a, bachelor, in, london, the, 1881, british, census, listed, wilde, as, a, boarder, at, 1, now, 44, tite, street, chelsea, where, frank, miles, a, society, painter, was, the, head, of, the, household, lillie, langtry, was, introduced, to, wilde, at, frank, miles, studio, in, 1877, the, most, glamorous, woman, in, england, langtry, assumed, great, importance, to, wilde, during, his, early, years, in, london, and, they, remained, close, friends, for, many, years, he, tutored, her, in, latin, and, later, encouraged, her, to, pursue, acting, she, wrote, in, her, autobiography, that, he, possessed, a, remarkably, fascinating, and, compelling, personality, and, the, cleverness, of, his, remarks, received, added, value, from, his, manner, of, delivering, them, wilde, regularly, attended, the, theatre, and, was, especially, taken, with, star, actresses, such, as, ellen, terry, and, sarah, bernhardt, in, 1880, he, completed, his, first, play, vera, or, the, nihilists, a, tragic, melodrama, about, russian, nihilism, and, distributed, privately, printed, copies, to, various, actresses, whom, he, hoped, to, interest, in, its, sole, female, role, a, one, off, performance, in, london, was, advertised, in, november, 1881, with, mrs, bernard, beere, as, vera, but, withdrawn, by, wilde, for, what, was, claimed, to, be, consideration, for, political, feeling, in, england, he, had, been, publishing, lyrics, and, poems, in, magazines, since, entering, trinity, college, especially, in, kottabos, and, the, dublin, university, magazine, in, mid, 1881, at, 27, years, old, he, published, poems, which, collected, revised, and, expanded, his, poems, though, the, book, sold, out, its, first, print, run, of, 750, copies, it, was, not, generally, well, received, by, the, critics, punch, for, example, said, that, the, poet, is, wilde, but, his, poetry, s, tame, by, a, tight, vote, the, oxford, union, condemned, the, book, for, alleged, plagiarism, the, librarian, who, had, requested, the, book, for, the, library, returned, the, presentation, copy, to, wilde, with, a, note, of, apology, biographer, richard, ellmann, argues, that, wilde, s, poem, h, las, was, a, sincere, though, flamboyant, attempt, to, explain, the, dichotomies, the, poet, saw, in, himself, one, line, reads, to, drift, with, every, passion, till, my, soul, is, a, stringed, lute, on, which, all, winds, can, play, the, book, had, further, printings, in, 1882, it, was, bound, in, a, rich, enamel, parchment, cover, embossed, with, gilt, blossom, and, printed, on, hand, made, dutch, paper, over, the, next, few, years, wilde, presented, many, copies, to, the, dignitaries, and, writers, who, received, him, during, his, lecture, tours, aestheticism, was, sufficiently, in, vogue, to, be, caricatured, by, gilbert, and, sullivan, in, patience, 1881, richard, d, oyly, carte, an, english, impresario, invited, wilde, to, make, a, lecture, tour, of, north, america, simultaneously, priming, the, pump, for, the, us, tour, of, patience, and, selling, this, most, charming, aesthete, to, the, american, public, wilde, journeyed, on, the, ss, arizona, arriving, on, 2, january, 1882, and, disembarking, the, following, day, originally, planned, to, last, four, months, the, tour, continued, for, almost, a, year, owing, to, its, commercial, success, wilde, sought, to, transpose, the, beauty, he, saw, in, art, into, daily, life, this, was, a, practical, as, well, as, philosophical, project, in, oxford, he, had, surrounded, himself, with, blue, china, and, lilies, and, now, one, of, his, lectures, was, on, interior, design, in, a, british, library, article, on, aestheticism, and, decadence, carolyn, burdett, writes, wilde, teased, his, readers, with, the, claim, that, life, imitates, art, rather, than, the, other, way, round, his, point, was, a, serious, one, we, notice, london, fogs, he, argued, because, art, and, literature, has, taught, us, to, do, so, wilde, among, others, performed, these, maxims, he, presented, himself, as, the, impeccably, dressed, and, mannered, dandy, figure, whose, life, was, a, work, of, art, when, asked, to, explain, reports, that, he, had, paraded, down, piccadilly, in, london, carrying, a, lily, long, hair, flowing, wilde, replied, it, s, not, whether, i, did, it, or, not, that, s, important, but, whether, people, believed, i, did, it, wilde, believed, that, the, artist, should, hold, forth, higher, ideals, and, that, pleasure, and, beauty, would, replace, utilitarian, ethics, wilde, and, aestheticism, were, both, mercilessly, caricatured, and, criticised, in, the, press, the, springfield, republican, for, instance, commented, on, wilde, s, behaviour, during, his, visit, to, boston, to, lecture, on, aestheticism, suggesting, that, wilde, s, conduct, was, more, a, bid, for, notoriety, rather, than, devotion, to, beauty, and, the, aesthetic, t, w, higginson, a, cleric, and, abolitionist, wrote, in, unmanly, manhood, of, his, general, concern, that, wilde, whose, only, distinction, is, that, he, has, written, a, thin, volume, of, very, mediocre, verse, would, improperly, influence, the, behaviour, of, men, and, women, according, to, biographer, mich, le, mendelssohn, wilde, was, the, subject, of, anti, irish, caricature, and, was, portrayed, as, a, monkey, a, blackface, performer, and, a, christy, s, minstrel, throughout, his, career, harper, s, weekly, put, a, sunflower, worshipping, monkey, dressed, as, wilde, on, the, front, of, the, january, 1882, issue, the, drawing, stimulated, other, american, maligners, and, in, england, had, a, full, page, reprint, in, the, lady, s, pictorial, when, the, national, republican, discussed, wilde, it, was, to, explain, a, few, items, as, to, the, animal, s, pedigree, and, on, 22, january, 1882, the, washington, post, illustrated, the, wild, man, of, borneo, alongside, oscar, wilde, of, england, and, asked, how, far, is, it, from, this, to, this, when, he, visited, san, francisco, the, san, francisco, chronicle, reported, the, city, is, divided, into, two, camps, those, who, thought, wilde, was, an, engaging, speaker, and, an, original, thinker, and, those, who, thought, he, was, the, most, pretentious, fraud, ever, perpetrated, on, a, groaning, public, though, his, press, reception, was, hostile, wilde, was, well, received, in, diverse, settings, across, america, he, drank, whiskey, with, miners, in, leadville, colorado, and, was, f, ted, at, the, most, fashionable, salons, in, many, cities, he, visited, his, earnings, plus, expected, income, from, the, duchess, of, padua, allowed, him, to, move, to, paris, between, february, and, mid, may, 1883, while, there, he, met, robert, sherard, whom, he, entertained, constantly, we, are, dining, on, the, duchess, tonight, wilde, would, declare, before, taking, him, to, an, expensive, restaurant, in, august, he, briefly, returned, to, new, york, for, the, production, of, vera, the, rights, of, which, he, had, sold, to, the, american, actress, marie, prescott, the, play, was, initially, well, received, by, the, audience, but, when, the, critics, wrote, lukewarm, reviews, attendance, fell, sharply, and, the, play, closed, a, week, after, it, had,

when, wilde, was, lecturing, at, the, gaiety, theatre, he, proposed, to, her, and, they, married, on, 29, may, 1884, at, the, anglican, st, james, s, church, paddington, in, london, although, constance, had, an, annual, allowance, of, 250, which, was, generous, for, a, young, woman, equivalent, to, 32, 900, in, 2023, the, wildes, had, relatively, luxurious, tastes, they, had, preached, to, others, for, so, long, on, the, subject, of, design, that, people, expected, their, home, to, set, new, standards, no, 16, tite, street, was, duly, renovated, in, seven, months, at, considerable, expense, the, couple, had, two, sons, cyril, 1885, and, vyvyan, 1886, wilde, became, the, sole, literary, signatory, of, george, bernard, shaw, s, petition, for, a, pardon, of, the, anarchists, arrested, and, later, executed, after, the, haymarket, massacre, in, chicago, in, 1886, in, 1886, while, at, oxford, wilde, met, robert, ross, ross, who, had, read, wilde, s, poems, before, they, met, seemed, unrestrained, by, the, victorian, prohibition, against, homosexuality, by, richard, ellmann, s, account, he, was, a, precocious, seventeen, year, old, who, so, young, and, yet, so, knowing, was, determined, to, seduce, wilde, according, to, daniel, mendelsohn, wilde, who, had, long, alluded, to, greek, love, was, initiated, into, homosexual, sex, by, ross, while, his, marriage, had, begun, to, unravel, after, his, wife, s, second, pregnancy, which, left, him, physically, repelled, wilde, had, a, number, of, favourite, haunts, in, london, these, included, the, caf, royal, in, piccadilly, hatchards, bookstore, in, piccadilly, and, the, department, stores, liberty, co, on, great, marlborough, street, and, harrods, in, knightsbridge, wilde, was, among, harrods, first, selected, customers, who, were, granted, extended, credit, criticism, over, artistic, matters, in, the, pall, mall, gazette, provoked, a, letter, of, self, defence, and, soon, wilde, was, a, contributor, to, that, and, other, journals, during, 1885, 87, although, richard, ellmann, has, claimed, that, wilde, enjoyed, reviewing, wilde, s, wife, would, tell, friends, that, mr, wilde, hates, journalism, like, his, parents, before, him, wilde, supported, ireland, s, cause, and, when, charles, stewart, parnell, was, falsely, accused, of, inciting, murder, he, wrote, a, series, of, astute, columns, defending, the, politician, in, the, daily, chronicle, his, flair, having, previously, been, put, mainly, into, socialising, suited, journalism, and, rapidly, attracted, notice, with, his, youth, nearly, over, and, a, family, to, support, in, mid, 1887, wilde, became, the, editor, of, the, lady, s, world, magazine, his, name, prominent, on, the, cover, he, promptly, renamed, it, as, the, woman, s, world, and, raised, its, tone, adding, serious, articles, on, parenting, culture, and, politics, while, keeping, discussions, of, fashion, and, arts, two, pieces, of, fiction, were, usually, included, one, to, be, read, to, children, the, other, for, adult, readers, wilde, worked, hard, to, solicit, good, contributions, from, his, wide, artistic, acquaintance, including, those, of, lady, wilde, and, his, wife, constance, while, his, own, literary, and, other, notes, were, themselves, popular, and, amusing, the, initial, vigour, and, excitement, which, he, brought, to, the, job, began, to, fade, as, administration, commuting, and, office, life, became, tedious, at, the, same, time, as, wilde, s, interest, flagged, the, publishers, became, concerned, about, circulation, sales, at, the, relatively, high, price, of, one, shilling, remained, low, increasingly, sending, instructions, to, the, magazine, by, letter, wilde, began, a, new, period, of, creative, work, and, his, own, column, appeared, less, regularly, in, october, 1889, wilde, had, finally, found, his, voice, in, prose, and, at, the, end, of, the, second, volume, wilde, left, the, woman, s, world, the, magazine, outlasted, him, by, only, a, year, wilde, s, period, at, the, helm, of, the, magazine, played, a, pivotal, role, in, his, development, as, a, writer, and, facilitated, his, ascent, to, fame, whilst, wilde, the, journalist, supplied, articles, under, the, guidance, of, his, editors, wilde, the, editor, was, forced, to, learn, to, manipulate, the, literary, marketplace, on, his, own, terms, during, the, 1880s, wilde, was, a, close, friend, of, the, artist, james, mcneill, whistler, and, they, dined, together, on, many, occasions, at, one, of, these, dinners, whistler, produced, a, bon, mot, that, wilde, found, particularly, witty, wilde, exclaimed, that, he, wished, that, he, had, said, it, whistler, retorted, you, will, oscar, you, will, herbert, vivian, a, mutual, friend, of, wilde, and, whistler, attended, the, dinner, and, recorded, it, in, his, article, the, reminiscences, of, a, short, life, which, appeared, in, the, sun, in, 1889, the, article, alleged, that, wilde, had, a, habit, of, passing, off, other, people, s, witticisms, as, his, own, especially, whistler, s, wilde, considered, vivian, s, article, to, be, a, scurrilous, betrayal, and, it, directly, caused, the, broken, friendship, between, wilde, and, whistler, the, reminiscences, also, caused, great, acrimony, between, wilde, and, vivian, wilde, accusing, vivian, of, the, inaccuracy, of, an, eavesdropper, with, the, method, of, a, blackmailer, and, banishing, vivian, from, his, circle, vivian, s, allegations, did, not, diminish, wilde, s, reputation, as, an, epigrammatist, london, theatre, director, luther, munday, recounted, some, of, wilde, s, typical, quips, wilde, said, of, whistler, that, he, had, no, enemies, but, was, intensely, disliked, by, his, friends, of, hall, caine, that, he, wrote, at, the, top, of, his, voice, of, rudyard, kipling, that, he, revealed, life, by, splendid, flashes, of, vulgarity, of, henry, james, that, he, wrote, fiction, as, if, it, were, a, painful, duty, and, of, marion, crawford, that, he, immolated, himself, on, the, altar, of, local, colour, wilde, had, been, regularly, writing, fairy, stories, for, magazines, he, published, the, happy, prince, and, other, tales, in, 1888, in, 1891, he, published, two, more, collections, lord, arthur, savile, s, crime, and, other, stories, and, in, september, a, house, of, pomegranates, was, dedicated, to, constance, mary, wilde, the, portrait, of, mr, w, h, which, wilde, had, begun, in, 1887, was, first, published, in, blackwood, s, edinburgh, magazine, in, july, 1889, it, is, a, short, story, which, reports, a, conversation, in, which, the, theory, that, shakespeare, s, sonnets, were, written, out, of, the, poet, s, love, of, the, boy, actor, willie, hughes, is, advanced, retracted, and, then, propounded, again, the, only, evidence, for, this, is, two, supposed, puns, within, the, sonnets, themselves, the, anonymous, narrator, is, at, first, sceptical, then, believing, and, finally, flirtatious, with, the, reader, he, concludes, that, there, is, really, a, great, deal, to, be, said, of, the, willie, hughes, theory, of, shakespeare, s, sonnets, by, the, end, fact, and, fiction, have, melded, together, arthur, ransome, wrote, that, wilde, read, something, of, himself, into, shakespeare, s, sonnets, and, became, fascinated, with, the, willie, hughes, theory, despite, the, lack, of, biographical, evidence, for, the, historical, william, hughes, existence, instead, of, writing, a, short, but, serious, essay, on, the, question, wilde, tossed, the, theory, to, the, three, characters, of, the, story, allowing, it, to, unfold, as, background, to, the, plot, an, early, masterpiece, of, wilde, s, combining, many, elements, that, interested, him, conversation, literature, and, the, idea, that, to, shed, oneself, of, an, idea, one, must, first, convince, another, of, its, truth, ransome, concludes, that, wilde, succeeds, precisely, because, the, literary, criticism, is, unveiled, with, such, a, deft, touch, though, containing, nothing, but, special, pleading, it, would, not, he, says, be, possible, to, build, an, airier, castle, in, spain, than, this, of, the, imaginary, william, hughes, we, continue, listening, nonetheless, to, be, charmed, by, the, telling, you, must, believe, in, willie, hughes, wilde, told, an, acquaintance, i, almost, do, myself, wilde, having, tired, of, journalism, had, been, busy, setting, out, his, aesthetic, ideas, more, fully, in, a, series, of, longer, prose, pieces, which, were, published, in, the, major, literary, intellectual, journals, of, the, day, in, january, 1889, the, decay, of, lying, a, dialogue, appeared, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, pen, pencil, and, poison, a, satirical, biography, of, thomas, griffiths, wainewright, in, the, fortnightly, review, edited, by, wilde, s, friend, frank, harris, two, of, wilde, s, four, writings, on, aesthetics, are, dialogues, though, wilde, had, evolved, professionally, from, lecturer, to, writer, he, retained, an, oral, tradition, of, sorts, having, always, excelled, as, a, wit, and, raconteur, he, often, composed, by, assembling, phrases, bons, mots, and, witticisms, into, a, longer, cohesive, work, wilde, was, concerned, about, the, effect, of, moralising, on, art, he, believed, in, art, s, redemptive, developmental, powers, art, is, individualism, and, individualism, is, a, disturbing, and, disintegrating, force, there, lies, its, immense, value, for, what, it, seeks, is, to, disturb, monotony, of, type, slavery, of, custom, tyranny, of, habit, and, the, reduction, of, man, to, the, level, of, a, machine, in, his, only, political, text, the, soul, of, man, under, socialism, he, argued, political, conditions, should, establish, this, primacy, private, property, should, be, abolished, and, cooperation, should, be, substituted, for, competition, he, wrote, socialism, communism, or, whatever, one, chooses, to, call, it, by, converting, private, property, into, public, wealth, and, substituting, co, operation, for, competition, will, restore, society, to, its, proper, condition, of, a, thoroughly, healthy, organism, and, insure, the, material, well, being, of, each, member, of, the, community, it, will, in, fact, give, life, its, proper, basis, and, its, proper, environment, at, the, same, time, he, stressed, that, the, government, most, amenable, to, artists, was, no, government, at, all, wilde, envisioned, a, society, where, mechanisation, has, freed, human, effort, from, the, burden, of, necessity, effort, which, can, instead, be, expended, on, artistic, creation, george, orwell, summarised, in, effect, the, world, will, be, populated, by, artists, each, striving, after, perfection, in, the, way, that, seems, best, to, him, this, point, of, view, did, not, align, him, with, the, fabians, intellectual, socialists, who, advocated, using, state, apparatus, to, change, social, conditions, nor, did, it, endear, him, to, the, monied, classes, whom, he, had, previously, entertained, hesketh, pearson, introducing, a, collection, of, wilde, s, essays, in, 1950, remarked, how, the, soul, of, man, under, socialism, had, been, an, inspirational, text, for, revolutionaries, in, tsarist, russia, but, laments, that, in, the, stalinist, era, it, is, doubtful, whether, there, are, any, uninspected, places, in, which, it, could, now, be, hidden, man, is, least, himself, when, he, talks, in, his, own, person, give, him, a, mask, and, he, will, tell, you, the, truth, from, the, critic, as, artist, published, in, intentions, 1891, wilde, considered, including, this, pamphlet, and, the, portrait, of, mr, w, h, his, essay, story, on, shakespeare, s, sonnets, in, a, new, anthology, in, 1891, but, eventually, decided, to, limit, it, to, purely, aesthetic, subjects, intentions, packaged, revisions, of, four, essays, the, decay, of, lying, pen, pencil, and, poison, the, truth, of, masks, first, published, 1885, and, the, critic, as, artist, in, two, parts, for, pearson, the, biographer, the, essays, and, dialogues, exhibit, every, aspect, of, wilde, s, genius, and, character, wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist, and, scholar, and, concludes, that, no, other, productions, of, his, have, as, varied, an, appeal, 1891, turned, out, to, be, wilde, s, annus, mirabilis, apart, from, his, three, collections, he, also, produced, his, only, novel, the, first, version, of, the, picture, of, dorian, gray, was, published, as, the, lead, story, in, the, july, 1890, edition, of, lippincott, s, monthly, magazine, along, with, five, others, the, story, begins, with, a, man, painting, a, picture, of, gray, when, gray, who, has, a, face, like, ivory, and, rose, leaves, sees, his, finished, portrait, he, breaks, down, distraught, that, his, beauty, will, fade, while, the, portrait, stays, beautiful, he, inadvertently, makes, a, faustian, bargain, in, which, only, the, painted, image, grows, old, while, he, stays, beautiful, and, young, for, wilde, the, purpose, of, art, would, be, to, guide, life, as, if, beauty, alone, were, its, object, as, gray, s, portrait, allows, him, to, escape, the, corporeal, ravages, of, his, hedonism, wilde, sought, to, juxtapose, the, beauty, he, saw, in, art, with, daily, life, reviewers, immediately, criticised, the, novel, s, decadence, and, homosexual, allusions, the, daily, chronicle, for, example, called, it, unclean, poisonous, and, heavy, with, the, mephitic, odours, of, moral, and, spiritual, putrefaction, wilde, vigorously, responded, writing, to, the, editor, of, the, scots, observer, in, which, he, clarified, his, stance, on, ethics, and, aesthetics, in, art, if, a, work, of, art, is, rich, and, vital, and, complete, those, who, have, artistic, instincts, will, see, its, beauty, and, those, to, whom, ethics, appeal, more, strongly, will, see, its, moral, lesson, he, nevertheless, revised, it, extensively, for, book, publication, in, 1891, six, new, chapters, were, added, some, overtly, decadent, passages, and, homo, eroticism, excised, and, a, preface, was, included, consisting, of, twenty, two, epigrams, such, as, books, are, well, written, or, badly, written, that, is, all, contemporary, reviewers, and, modern, critics, have, postulated, numerous, possible, sources, of, the, story, a, search, jershua, mccormack, argues, is, futile, because, wilde, has, tapped, a, root, of, western, folklore, so, deep, and, ubiquitous, that, the, story, has, escaped, its, origins, and, returned, to, the, oral, tradition, wilde, claimed, the, plot, was, an, idea, that, is, as, old, as, the, history, of, literature, but, to, which, i, have, given, a, new, form, modern, critic, robin, mckie, considered, the, novel, to, be, technically, mediocre, saying, that, the, conceit, of, the, plot, had, guaranteed, its, fame, but, the, device, is, never, pushed, to, its, full, on, the, other, hand, robert, mccrum, of, the, guardian, lists, it, among, the, 100, best, novels, ever, written, in, english, calling, it, an, arresting, and, slightly, camp, exercise, in, late, victorian, gothic, the, novel, has, been, the, subject, of, many, adaptations, to, film, and, stage, and, one, of, its, most, quoted, lines, there, is, only, one, thing, in, the, world, worse, than, being, talked, about, and, that, is, not, being, talked, about, features, in, monty, python, s, oscar, wilde, sketch, in, an, episode, of, monty, python, s, flying, circus, the, 1891, census, records, the, wildes, residence, at, 16, tite, street, where, oscar, lived, with, his, wife, constance, and, two, sons, not, content, with, being, better, known, than, ever, in, london, though, he, returned, to, paris, in, october, 1891, this, time, as, a, respected, writer, he, was, received, at, the, salons, litt, raires, including, the, famous, mardis, of, st, phane, mallarm, a, renowned, symbolist, poet, of, the, time, wilde, s, two, plays, during, the, 1880s, vera, or, the, nihilists, and, the, duchess, of, padua, had, not, met, with, much, success, he, had, continued, his, interest, in, the, theatre, and, now, after, finding, his, voice, in, prose, his, thoughts, turned, again, to, the, dramatic, form, as, the, biblical, iconography, of, salome, filled, his, mind, one, evening, after, discussing, depictions, of, salome, throughout, history, he, returned, to, his, hotel, and, noticed, a, blank, copybook, lying, on, the, desk, and, it, occurred, to, him, to, write, in, it, what, he, had, been, saying, the, result, was, a, new, play, salom, written, rapidly, and, in, french, a, tragedy, it, tells, the, story, of, salome, the, stepdaughter, of, the, tetrarch, herod, antipas, who, to, her, stepfather, s, dismay, but, mother, s, delight, requests, the, head, of, jokanaan, john, the, baptist, on, a, silver, platter, as, a, reward, for, dancing, the, dance, of, the, seven, veils, when, wilde, returned, to, london, just, before, christmas, the, paris, echo, referred, to, him, as, le, great, event, of, the, season, rehearsals, of, the, play, starring, sarah, bernhardt, began, but, the, play, was, refused, a, licence, by, the, lord, chamberlain, since, it, depicted, biblical, characters, salome, was, published, jointly, in, paris, and, london, in, 1893, in, the, original, french, and, in, london, a, year, later, in, lord, alfred, douglas, s, english, translation, with, illustrations, by, aubrey, beardsley, though, it, was, not, performed, until, 1896, in, paris, during, wilde, s, incarceration, wilde, who, had, first, set, out, to, irritate, victorian, society, with, his, dress, and, talking, points, then, to, outrage, it, with, dorian, gray, his, novel, of, vice, hidden, beneath, art, finally, found, a, way, to, critique, society, on, its, own, terms, lady, windermere, s, fan, was, first, performed, on, 20, february, 1892, at, st, james, s, theatre, packed, with, the, cream, of, society, on, the, surface, a, witty, comedy, there, is, subtle, subversion, underneath, it, concludes, with, collusive, concealment, rather, than, collective, disclosure, the, audience, like, lady, windermere, are, forced, to, soften, harsh, social, codes, in, favour, of, a, more, nuanced, view, the, play, was, enormously, popular, touring, the, country, for, months, but, largely, trashed, by, conservative, critics, the, success, of, the, play, saw, wilde, earn, 7, 000, in, the, first, year, alone, worth, 961, 500, as, of, june, 2022, his, first, hit, play, was, followed, by, a, woman, of, no, importance, in, 1893, another, victorian, comedy, revolving, around, the, spectre, of, illegitimate, births, mistaken, identities, and, late, revelations, wilde, was, commissioned, to, write, two, more, plays, and, an, ideal, husband, written, in, 1894, followed, in, january, 1895, peter, raby, said, these, essentially, english, plays, were, well, pitched, wilde, with, one, eye, on, the, dramatic, genius, of, ibsen, and, the, other, on, the, commercial, competition, in, london, s, west, end, targeted, his, audience, with, adroit, precision, in, mid, 1891, lionel, johnson, introduced, wilde, to, lord, alfred, douglas, johnson, s, cousin, who, was, at, the, time, an, undergraduate, at, oxford, known, to, his, family, and, friends, as, bosie, he, was, a, handsome, and, spoilt, young, man, an, intimate, friendship, sprang, up, between, wilde, and, douglas, and, by, 1893, wilde, was, infatuated, with, douglas, and, they, consorted, together, regularly, in, a, tempestuous, affair, if, wilde, was, relatively, indiscreet, even, flamboyant, in, the, way, he, acted, douglas, was, reckless, in, public, wilde, who, was, earning, up, to, 100, a, week, from, his, plays, his, salary, at, the, woman, s, world, had, been, 6, indulged, douglas, s, every, whim, material, artistic, or, sexual, douglas, soon, initiated, wilde, into, the, victorian, underground, of, gay, prostitution, and, wilde, was, introduced, to, a, series, of, young, working, class, male, prostitutes, rent, boys, from, 1892, onwards, by, alfred, taylor, these, infrequent, rendezvous, usually, took, the, same, form, wilde, would, meet, the, boy, offer, him, gifts, dine, him, privately, and, then, take, him, to, a, hotel, room, unlike, wilde, s, idealised, relations, with, ross, john, gray, and, douglas, all, of, whom, remained, part, of, his, aesthetic, circle, these, consorts, were, uneducated, and, knew, nothing, of, literature, soon, his, public, and, private, lives, had, become, sharply, divided, in, de, profundis, he, wrote, to, douglas, that, it, was, like, feasting, with, panthers, the, danger, was, half, the, excitement, i, did, not, know, that, when, they, were, to, strike, at, me, it, was, to, be, at, another, s, piping, and, at, another, s, pay, douglas, and, some, oxford, friends, founded, a, journal, the, chameleon, to, which, wilde, sent, a, page, of, paradoxes, originally, destined, for, the, saturday, review, phrases, and, philosophies, for, the, use, of, the, young, was, to, come, under, attack, six, months, later, at, wilde, s, trial, where, he, was, forced, to, defend, the, magazine, to, which, he, had, sent, his, work, in, any, case, it, became, unique, the, chameleon, was, not, published, again, lord, alfred, s, father, the, marquess, of, queensberry, was, known, for, his, outspoken, atheism, brutish, manner, and, creation, of, the, modern, rules, of, boxing, queensberry, who, feuded, regularly, with, his, son, confronted, wilde, and, lord, alfred, about, the, nature, of, their, relationship, several, times, but, wilde, was, able, to, mollify, him, in, june, 1894, he, called, on, wilde, at, 16, tite, street, without, an, appointment, and, clarified, his, stance, i, do, not, say, that, you, are, it, but, you, look, it, and, pose, at, it, which, is, just, as, bad, and, if, i, catch, you, and, my, son, again, in, any, public, restaurant, i, will, thrash, you, to, which, wilde, responded, i, don, t, know, what, the, queensberry, rules, are, but, the, oscar, wilde, rule, is, to, shoot, on, sight, his, account, in, de, profundis, was, less, triumphant, it, was, when, in, my, library, at, tite, street, waving, his, small, hands, in, the, air, in, epileptic, fury, your, father, stood, uttering, every, foul, word, his, foul, mind, could, think, of, and, screaming, the, loathsome, threats, he, afterwards, with, such, cunning, carried, out, queensberry, only, described, the, scene, once, saying, wilde, had, shown, him, the, white, feather, meaning, he, had, acted, in, a, cowardly, way, though, trying, to, remain, calm, wilde, saw, that, he, was, becoming, ensnared, in, a, brutal, family, quarrel, he, did, not, wish, to, bear, queensberry, s, insults, but, he, knew, that, confronting, him, could, lead, to, disaster, were, his, liaisons, disclosed, publicly, wilde, s, final, play, again, returns, to, the, theme, of, switched, identities, the, play, s, two, protagonists, engage, in, bunburying, the, maintenance, of, alternative, personas, in, the, town, and, country, which, allows, them, to, escape, victorian, social, mores, earnest, is, even, lighter, in, tone, than, wilde, s, earlier, comedies, while, their, characters, often, rise, to, serious, themes, in, moments, of, crisis, earnest, lacks, the, by, now, stock, wildean, characters, there, is, no, woman, with, a, past, the, principals, are, neither, villainous, nor, cunning, simply, idle, cultiv, s, and, the, idealistic, young, women, are, not, that, innocent, mostly, set, in, drawing, rooms, and, almost, completely, lacking, in, action, or, violence, earnest, lacks, the, self, conscious, decadence, found, in, the, picture, of, dorian, gray, and, salome, the, play, now, considered, wilde, s, masterpiece, was, rapidly, written, in, wilde, s, artistic, maturity, in, late, 1894, it, was, first, performed, on, 14, february, 1895, at, st, james, s, theatre, in, london, wilde, s, second, collaboration, with, george, alexander, the, actor, manager, both, author, and, producer, assiduously, revised, prepared, and, rehearsed, every, line, scene, and, setting, in, the, months, before, the, premiere, creating, a, carefully, constructed, representation, of, late, victorian, society, yet, simultaneously, mocking, it, during, rehearsal, alexander, requested, that, wilde, shorten, the, play, from, four, acts, to, three, which, the, author, did, premieres, at, st, james, s, seemed, like, brilliant, parties, and, the, opening, of, the, importance, of, being, earnest, was, no, exception, allan, aynesworth, who, played, algernon, recalled, to, hesketh, pearson, in, my, fifty, three, years, of, acting, i, never, remember, a, greater, triumph, than, first, night, earnest, s, immediate, reception, as, wilde, s, best, work, to, date, finally, crystallised, his, fame,

to, imagine, mr, oscar, wilde, has, decorated, a, humour, that, is, gilbertian, with, innumerable, spangles, of, that, wit, that, is, all, his, own, the, importance, of, being, earnest, remains, his, most, popular, play, wilde, s, professional, success, was, mirrored, by, an, escalation, in, his, feud, with, queensberry, queensberry, had, planned, to, insult, wilde, publicly, by, throwing, a, bouquet, of, rotting, vegetables, onto, the, stage, wilde, was, tipped, off, and, had, queensberry, barred, from, entering, the, theatre, fifteen, weeks, later, wilde, was, in, prison, on, 18, february, 1895, the, marquess, of, queensberry, left, his, calling, card, at, wilde, s, club, the, albemarle, inscribed, for, oscar, wilde, posing, somdomite, wilde, encouraged, by, douglas, and, against, the, advice, of, his, friends, initiated, a, private, prosecution, against, queensberry, for, defamatory, libel, since, the, note, amounted, to, a, public, accusation, that, wilde, had, committed, the, crime, of, sodomy, queensberry, was, arrested, for, criminal, libel, a, charge, carrying, a, possible, sentence, of, up, to, two, years, in, prison, under, the, libel, act, 1843, queensberry, could, avoid, conviction, for, libel, only, by, demonstrating, that, his, accusation, was, in, fact, true, and, furthermore, that, there, was, some, public, benefit, to, having, made, the, accusation, openly, queensberry, s, lawyers, thus, hired, private, detectives, to, find, evidence, of, wilde, s, homosexual, liaisons, wilde, s, friends, had, advised, him, against, the, prosecution, at, a, saturday, review, meeting, at, the, caf, royal, on, 24, march, 1895, frank, harris, warned, him, that, they, are, going, to, prove, sodomy, against, you, and, advised, him, to, flee, to, france, wilde, and, douglas, walked, out, in, a, huff, wilde, saying, it, is, at, such, moments, as, these, that, one, sees, who, are, one, s, true, friends, the, scene, was, witnessed, by, george, bernard, shaw, who, recalled, it, to, arthur, ransome, a, day, or, so, before, ransome, s, trial, for, libelling, douglas, in, 1913, to, ransome, it, confirmed, what, he, had, said, in, his, 1912, book, on, wilde, that, douglas, s, rivalry, for, wilde, with, robbie, ross, and, his, arguments, with, his, father, had, resulted, in, wilde, s, public, disaster, as, wilde, wrote, in, de, profundis, douglas, lost, his, case, shaw, included, an, account, of, the, argument, between, harris, douglas, and, wilde, in, the, preface, to, his, play, the, dark, lady, of, the, sonnets, the, libel, trial, became, a, cause, c, l, bre, as, salacious, details, of, wilde, s, private, life, with, taylor, and, douglas, began, to, appear, in, the, press, a, team, of, private, detectives, had, directed, queensberry, s, lawyers, led, by, edward, carson, qc, to, the, world, of, the, victorian, underground, wilde, s, association, with, blackmailers, and, male, prostitutes, cross, dressers, and, homosexual, brothels, was, recorded, and, various, persons, involved, were, interviewed, some, being, coerced, to, appear, as, witnesses, since, they, too, were, accomplices, to, the, crimes, of, which, wilde, was, accused, the, trial, opened, at, the, old, bailey, in, central, london, on, 3, april, 1895, before, justice, richard, henn, collins, a, fellow, dubliner, amid, scenes, of, near, hysteria, both, in, the, press, and, the, public, galleries, the, extent, of, the, evidence, massed, against, wilde, forced, him, to, declare, meekly, i, am, the, prosecutor, in, this, case, wilde, s, lawyer, sir, edward, clarke, opened, the, case, by, pre, emptively, asking, wilde, about, two, suggestive, letters, wilde, had, written, to, douglas, which, the, defence, had, in, its, possession, he, characterised, the, first, as, a, prose, sonnet, and, admitted, that, the, poetical, language, might, seem, strange, to, the, court, but, claimed, its, intent, was, innocent, wilde, stated, that, the, letters, had, been, obtained, by, blackmailers, who, had, attempted, to, extort, money, from, him, but, he, had, refused, suggesting, they, should, take, the, 60, equal, to, 8, 800, today, offered, unusual, for, a, prose, piece, of, that, length, he, claimed, to, regard, the, letters, as, works, of, art, rather, than, something, of, which, to, be, ashamed, carson, who, was, also, a, dubliner, who, had, attended, trinity, college, dublin, at, the, same, time, as, wilde, cross, examined, wilde, on, how, he, perceived, the, moral, content, of, his, works, wilde, replied, with, characteristic, wit, and, flippancy, claiming, that, works, of, art, are, not, capable, of, being, moral, or, immoral, but, only, well, or, poorly, made, and, that, only, brutes, and, illiterates, whose, views, on, art, are, incalculably, stupid, would, make, such, judgements, about, art, carson, a, leading, barrister, diverged, from, the, normal, practice, of, asking, closed, questions, carson, pressed, wilde, on, each, topic, from, every, angle, squeezing, out, nuances, of, meaning, from, wilde, s, answers, removing, them, from, their, aesthetic, context, and, portraying, wilde, as, evasive, and, decadent, while, wilde, won, the, most, laughs, carson, scored, the, most, legal, points, to, undermine, wilde, s, credibility, and, to, justify, queensberry, s, description, of, wilde, as, a, posing, somdomite, carson, drew, from, the, witness, an, admission, of, his, capacity, for, posing, by, demonstrating, that, he, had, lied, about, his, age, under, oath, playing, on, this, he, returned, to, the, topic, throughout, his, cross, examination, carson, also, tried, to, justify, queensberry, s, characterisation, by, quoting, from, wilde, s, novel, the, picture, of, dorian, gray, referring, in, particular, to, a, scene, in, the, second, chapter, in, which, lord, henry, wotton, explains, his, decadent, philosophy, to, dorian, an, innocent, young, man, in, carson, s, words, carson, then, moved, to, the, factual, evidence, and, questioned, wilde, about, his, friendships, with, lower, class, males, some, of, whom, were, as, young, as, sixteen, when, wilde, had, met, them, wilde, admitted, being, on, a, first, name, basis, and, lavishing, gifts, upon, them, but, insisted, that, nothing, untoward, had, occurred, and, that, the, men, were, merely, good, friends, of, his, carson, repeatedly, pointed, out, the, unusual, nature, of, these, relationships, and, insinuated, that, the, men, were, prostitutes, wilde, replied, that, he, did, not, believe, in, social, barriers, and, simply, enjoyed, the, society, of, young, men, then, carson, asked, wilde, directly, whether, he, had, ever, kissed, a, certain, servant, boy, wilde, responded, oh, dear, no, he, was, a, particularly, plain, boy, unfortunately, ugly, i, pitied, him, for, it, carson, pressed, him, on, the, answer, repeatedly, asking, why, the, boy, s, ugliness, was, relevant, wilde, hesitated, then, for, the, first, time, became, flustered, you, sting, me, and, insult, me, and, try, to, unnerve, me, and, at, times, one, says, things, flippantly, when, one, ought, to, speak, more, seriously, in, his, opening, speech, for, the, defence, carson, announced, that, he, had, located, several, male, prostitutes, who, were, to, testify, that, they, had, had, sex, with, wilde, on, the, advice, of, his, lawyers, wilde, dropped, the, prosecution, queensberry, was, found, not, guilty, as, the, court, declared, that, his, accusation, that, wilde, was, posing, as, a, somdomite, was, justified, true, in, substance, and, in, fact, under, the, libel, act, 1843, queensberry, s, acquittal, rendered, wilde, legally, liable, for, the, considerable, expenses, queensberry, had, incurred, in, his, defence, which, left, wilde, bankrupt, after, wilde, left, the, court, a, warrant, for, his, arrest, was, applied, for, on, charges, of, sodomy, and, gross, indecency, robbie, ross, found, wilde, at, the, cadogan, hotel, pont, street, knightsbridge, with, reginald, turner, both, men, advised, wilde, to, go, at, once, to, dover, and, try, to, get, a, boat, to, france, his, mother, advised, him, to, stay, and, fight, wilde, lapsing, into, inaction, could, only, say, the, train, has, gone, it, s, too, late, on, 6, april, 1895, wilde, was, arrested, for, gross, indecency, under, section, 11, of, the, criminal, law, amendment, act, 1885, a, term, meaning, homosexual, acts, not, amounting, to, buggery, an, offence, under, a, separate, statute, at, wilde, s, instruction, ross, and, wilde, s, butler, forced, their, way, into, the, bedroom, and, library, of, 16, tite, street, packing, some, personal, effects, manuscripts, and, letters, wilde, was, then, imprisoned, on, remand, at, holloway, where, he, received, daily, visits, from, douglas, events, moved, quickly, and, his, prosecution, opened, on, 26, april, 1895, before, mr, justice, charles, wilde, pleaded, not, guilty, he, had, already, begged, douglas, to, leave, london, for, paris, but, douglas, complained, bitterly, even, wanting, to, give, evidence, he, was, pressed, to, go, and, soon, fled, to, the, hotel, du, monde, fearing, persecution, ross, and, many, others, also, left, the, united, kingdom, during, this, time, under, cross, examination, wilde, was, at, first, hesitant, then, spoke, eloquently, charles, gill, prosecuting, what, is, the, love, that, dare, not, speak, its, name, wilde, the, love, that, dare, not, speak, its, name, in, this, century, is, such, a, great, affection, of, an, elder, for, a, younger, man, as, there, was, between, david, and, jonathan, such, as, plato, made, the, very, basis, of, his, philosophy, and, such, as, you, find, in, the, sonnets, of, michelangelo, and, shakespeare, it, is, that, deep, spiritual, affection, that, is, as, pure, as, it, is, perfect, it, dictates, and, pervades, great, works, of, art, like, those, of, shakespeare, and, michelangelo, and, those, two, letters, of, mine, such, as, they, are, it, is, in, this, century, misunderstood, so, much, misunderstood, that, it, may, be, described, as, the, love, that, dare, not, speak, its, name, and, on, that, account, of, it, i, am, placed, where, i, am, now, it, is, beautiful, it, is, fine, it, is, the, noblest, form, of, affection, there, is, nothing, unnatural, about, it, it, is, intellectual, and, it, repeatedly, exists, between, an, elder, and, a, younger, man, when, the, elder, man, has, intellect, and, the, younger, man, has, all, the, joy, hope, and, glamour, of, life, before, him, that, it, should, be, so, the, world, does, not, understand, the, world, mocks, at, it, and, sometimes, puts, one, in, the, pillory, for, it, loud, applause, mingled, with, some, hisses, this, response, was, counter, productive, in, a, legal, sense, for, it, only, served, to, reinforce, the, charges, of, homosexual, behaviour, the, trial, ended, with, the, jury, unable, to, reach, a, verdict, wilde, s, counsel, sir, edward, clarke, was, finally, able, to, get, a, magistrate, to, allow, wilde, and, his, friends, to, post, bail, the, reverend, stewart, headlam, put, up, most, of, the, 5, 000, surety, required, by, the, court, having, disagreed, with, wilde, s, treatment, by, the, press, and, the, courts, wilde, was, freed, from, holloway, and, shunning, attention, went, into, hiding, at, the, house, of, ernest, and, ada, leverson, two, of, his, firm, friends, edward, carson, approached, sir, frank, lockwood, qc, the, solicitor, general, and, asked, can, we, not, let, up, on, the, fellow, now, lockwood, answered, that, he, would, like, to, do, so, but, feared, that, the, case, had, become, too, politicised, to, be, dropped, the, final, trial, was, presided, over, by, mr, justice, wills, on, 25, may, 1895, wilde, and, alfred, taylor, were, convicted, of, gross, indecency, and, sentenced, to, two, years, hard, labour, the, judge, described, the, sentence, the, maximum, allowed, as, totally, inadequate, for, a, case, such, as, this, and, that, the, case, was, the, worst, case, i, have, ever, tried, wilde, s, response, of, and, i, may, i, say, nothing, my, lord, was, drowned, out, in, cries, of, shame, in, the, courtroom, although, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, charges, were, related, to, wilde, s, consensual, activities, the, trials, of, oscar, wilde, which, includes, an, original, transcript, of, the, libel, trial, which, came, to, light, in, 2000, suggests, that, he, took, advantage, of, teenagers, antony, edmonds, feels, that, wilde, would, have, faced, prosecution, today, for, example, he, certainly, paid, for, sex, with, youths, under, the, age, of, 18, which, is, a, criminal, offence, but, even, if, his, activities, had, led, only, to, exposure, and, not, to, arrest, he, would, have, been, savagely, pilloried, in, the, media, wilde, was, 39, when, he, seduced, alphonse, conway, and, conway, was, an, inexperienced, boy, of, 16, another, teenager, who, said, they, had, engaged, in, sex, acts, with, wilde, walter, grainger, who, was, 16, at, the, time, said, wilde, had, threatened, him, with, very, serious, trouble, if, he, told, anyone, about, their, relationship, marriageable, age, and, the, age, of, consent, in, england, was, 16, at, the, time, having, been, 13, as, recently, as, 1885, the, offences, against, the, person, act, 1875, raised, the, age, of, consent, to, 13, years, old, and, a, decade, later, the, criminal, law, amendment, act, 1885, raised, the, age, of, consent, to, 16, years, old, just, ten, years, before, the, trial, when, first, i, was, put, into, prison, some, people, advised, me, to, try, and, forget, who, i, was, it, was, ruinous, advice, it, is, only, by, realising, what, i, am, that, i, have, found, comfort, of, any, kind, now, i, am, advised, by, others, to, try, on, my, release, to, forget, that, i, have, ever, been, in, a, prison, at, all, i, know, that, would, be, equally, fatal, it, would, mean, that, i, would, always, be, haunted, by, an, intolerable, sense, of, disgrace, and, that, those, things, that, are, meant, for, me, as, much, as, for, anybody, else, the, beauty, of, the, sun, and, moon, the, pageant, of, the, seasons, the, music, of, daybreak, and, the, silence, of, great, nights, the, rain, falling, through, the, leaves, or, the, dew, creeping, over, the, grass, and, making, it, silver, would, all, be, tainted, for, me, and, lose, their, healing, power, and, their, power, of, communicating, joy, to, regret, one, s, own, experiences, is, to, arrest, one, s, own, development, to, deny, one, s, own, experiences, is, to, put, a, lie, into, the, lips, of, one, s, own, life, it, is, no, less, than, a, denial, of, the, soul, de, profundis, having, been, convicted, in, one, of, the, first, celebrity, trials, wilde, was, incarcerated, from, 25, may, 1895, to, 18, may, 1897, he, first, entered, newgate, prison, in, london, for, processing, then, was, moved, to, pentonville, prison, where, the, hard, labour, to, which, he, had, been, sentenced, consisted, of, many, hours, of, walking, a, treadmill, and, picking, oakum, separating, the, fibres, in, scraps, of, old, navy, ropes, and, where, prisoners, were, allowed, to, read, only, the, bible, and, the, pilgrim, s, progress, a, few, months, later, he, was, moved, to, wandsworth, prison, in, london, inmates, there, also, followed, the, regimen, of, hard, labour, hard, fare, and, a, hard, bed, which, wore, harshly, on, wilde, s, delicate, health, in, november, he, collapsed, during, chapel, from, illness, and, hunger, his, right, ear, drum, was, ruptured, in, the, fall, an, injury, that, later, contributed, to, his, death, he, spent, two, months, in, the, infirmary, richard, b, haldane, the, liberal, mp, and, reformer, visited, wilde, and, had, him, transferred, in, november, to, reading, gaol, 30, miles, 48, km, west, of, london, on, 23, november, 1895, the, transfer, itself, was, the, lowest, point, of, his, incarceration, as, a, crowd, jeered, and, spat, at, him, on, the, platform, at, clapham, junction, railway, station, in, 2019, a, rainbow, plaque, was, unveiled, at, the, station, recalling, this, event, he, spent, the, remainder, of, his, sentence, at, reading, addressed, and, identified, only, as, c, 3, 3, the, occupant, of, the, third, cell, on, the, third, floor, of, c, ward, about, five, months, after, wilde, arrived, at, reading, gaol, charles, thomas, wooldridge, a, trooper, in, the, royal, horse, guards, was, brought, to, reading, to, await, his, trial, for, murdering, his, wife, on, 29, march, 1896, on, 17, june, wooldridge, was, sentenced, to, death, and, returned, to, reading, for, his, execution, which, took, place, on, tuesday, 7, july, 1896, the, first, hanging, at, reading, in, 18, years, from, wooldridge, s, hanging, wilde, later, wrote, the, ballad, of, reading, gaol, wilde, was, not, at, first, even, allowed, paper, and, pen, but, haldane, eventually, succeeded, in, allowing, access, to, books, and, writing, materials, wilde, requested, among, others, the, bible, in, french, italian, and, german, grammars, some, ancient, greek, texts, dante, s, divine, comedy, joris, karl, huysmans, s, new, french, novel, about, christian, redemption, en, route, and, essays, by, st, augustine, cardinal, newman, and, walter, pater, between, january, and, march, 1897, wilde, wrote, a, 50, 000, word, letter, to, douglas, he, was, not, allowed, to, send, it, but, was, permitted, to, take, it, with, him, when, released, from, prison, in, reflective, mode, wilde, coldly, examines, his, career, to, date, how, he, had, been, a, colourful, agent, provocateur, in, victorian, society, his, art, like, his, paradoxes, seeking, to, subvert, as, well, as, sparkle, his, estimation, of, himself, was, one, who, stood, in, symbolic, relations, to, the, art, and, culture, of, my, age, it, was, from, these, heights, that, his, life, with, douglas, began, and, wilde, examines, that, particularly, closely, repudiating, him, for, what, wilde, finally, sees, as, his, arrogance, and, vanity, he, had, not, forgotten, douglas, remark, when, he, was, ill, when, you, are, not, on, your, pedestal, you, are, not, interesting, wilde, blamed, himself, though, for, the, ethical, degradation, of, character, that, he, allowed, douglas, to, bring, about, in, him, and, took, responsibility, for, his, own, fall, i, am, here, for, having, tried, to, put, your, father, in, prison, the, first, half, concludes, with, wilde, forgiving, douglas, for, his, own, sake, as, much, as, douglas, s, the, second, half, of, the, letter, traces, wilde, s, spiritual, journey, of, redemption, and, fulfilment, through, his, prison, reading, he, realised, that, his, ordeal, had, filled, his, soul, with, the, fruit, of, experience, however, bitter, it, tasted, at, the, time, i, wanted, to, eat, of, the, fruit, of, all, the, trees, in, the, garden, of, the, world, and, so, indeed, i, went, out, and, so, i, lived, my, only, mistake, was, that, i, confined, myself, so, exclusively, to, the, trees, of, what, seemed, to, me, the, sun, lit, side, of, the, garden, and, shunned, the, other, side, for, its, shadow, and, its, gloom, wilde, was, released, from, prison, on, 19, may, 1897, and, sailed, that, evening, for, dieppe, france, he, never, returned, to, the, united, kingdom, on, his, release, he, gave, the, manuscript, to, ross, who, may, or, may, not, have, carried, out, wilde, s, instructions, to, send, a, copy, to, douglas, who, later, denied, having, received, it, the, letter, was, partially, published, in, 1905, as, de, profundis, its, complete, and, correct, publication, first, occurred, in, 1962, in, the, letters, of, oscar, wilde, though, wilde, s, health, had, suffered, greatly, from, the, harshness, and, diet, of, prison, he, had, a, feeling, of, spiritual, renewal, he, immediately, wrote, to, the, society, of, jesus, requesting, a, six, month, catholic, retreat, when, the, request, was, denied, wilde, wept, i, intend, to, be, received, into, the, catholic, church, before, long, wilde, told, a, journalist, who, asked, about, his, religious, intentions, he, spent, his, last, three, years, impoverished, and, in, exile, he, took, the, name, sebastian, melmoth, after, saint, sebastian, and, the, titular, character, of, melmoth, the, wanderer, a, gothic, novel, by, charles, maturin, wilde, s, great, uncle, wilde, wrote, two, long, letters, to, the, editor, of, the, daily, chronicle, describing, the, brutal, conditions, of, english, prisons, and, advocating, penal, reform, his, discussion, of, the, dismissal, of, warder, martin, for, giving, biscuits, to, an, anaemic, child, prisoner, repeated, the, themes, of, the, corruption, and, degeneration, of, punishment, that, he, had, earlier, outlined, in, the, soul, of, man, under, socialism, wilde, spent, mid, 1897, with, robert, ross, in, the, seaside, village, of, berneval, le, grand, in, northern, france, where, he, wrote, the, ballad, of, reading, gaol, narrating, the, execution, of, charles, thomas, wooldridge, who, murdered, his, wife, in, a, rage, at, her, infidelity, it, moves, from, an, objective, story, telling, to, symbolic, identification, with, the, prisoners, no, attempt, is, made, to, assess, the, justice, of, the, laws, which, convicted, them, but, rather, the, poem, highlights, the, brutality, of, the, punishment, that, all, convicts, share, wilde, juxtaposes, the, executed, man, and, himself, with, the, line, yet, each, man, kills, the, thing, he, loves, he, adopted, the, proletarian, ballad, form, and, the, author, was, credited, as, c33, wilde, s, cell, number, in, reading, gaol, he, suggested, that, it, be, published, in, reynolds, magazine, because, it, circulates, widely, among, the, criminal, classes, to, which, i, now, belong, for, once, i, will, be, read, by, my, peers, a, new, experience, for, me, it, was, an, immediate, roaring, commercial, success, going, through, seven, editions, in, less, than, two, years, only, after, which, was, added, to, the, title, page, though, many, in, literary, circles, had, known, wilde, to, be, the, author, although, douglas, had, been, the, cause, of, his, misfortunes, he, and, wilde, were, reunited, in, august, 1897, at, rouen, this, meeting, was, disapproved, of, by, the, friends, and, families, of, both, men, constance, wilde, was, already, refusing, to, meet, wilde, or, allow, him, to, see, their, sons, though,

of, embarrassing, chance, encounters, with, hostile, english, visitors, or, frenchmen, he, had, known, in, better, days, drowned, his, spirit, soon, wilde, was, sufficiently, confined, to, his, hotel,
