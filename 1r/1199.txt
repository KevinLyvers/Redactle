the, city, of, harar, according, to, sixteenth, century, adal, writer, arab, faq, h, due, to, the, secular, rule, of, sultan, abu, bakr, ibn, muhammad, ahmad, would, leave, harar, and, return, to, hubat, 165, after, the, death, of, imam, mahfuz, garad, abun, adashe, would, become, the, most, popular, ruler, of, adal, sparking, conflict, with, the, ruling, walashma, dynasty, for, seven, years, as, an, elite, infantryman, of, hubat, ahmad, joined, adashe, in, his, power, struggles, against, the, walashma, it, was, during, this, conflict, that, ahmad, demonstrated, his, courage, intelligence, and, military, leadership, garad, abun, who, was, astonished, by, the, military, valour, of, ahmad, arranged, for, him, to, marry, the, late, mahfuz, s, youngest, daughter, bati, del, wambara, xxxiii, the, adal, sultan, abu, bakr, ibn, muhammad, is, said, to, have, established, his, capital, at, harar, and, recruited, a, large, number, of, somalis, into, his, army, together, with, his, somali,

raising, another, large, body, of, somali, followers, abu, bakr, met, ahmad, for, the, second, time, it, was, an, indecisive, clash, that, only, forced, the, sultan, to, retreat, back, into, the, ogaden, and, ahmad, remained, in, hubat, as, an, independent, governor, of, the, rebel, province, upon, hearing, that, a, rebel, named, ahmad, ibn, ibrahim, was, in, a, power, struggle, with, the, adal, leaders, the, emperor, of, ethiopia, dawit, ii, sent, his, general, degelhan, to, confront, him, the, abyssinian, campaign, originally, seemed, successful, as, large, amounts, of, women, and, children, of, adal, were, captured, by, degelhan, including, the, mother, of, ahmad, s, commander, abu, bakr, qatin, meanwhile, emir, ahmad, had, laid, a, trap, in, hubat, splitting, his, unit, into, three, he, waited, for, the, abyssinians, to, enter, the, region, after, sacking, harar, and, ambushed, them, in, the, battle, of, hubat, the, remaining, abyssinian, army, who, were, not, killed, fled, in, panic, thus, ahmed, s, troops, won, decisively, and, were, able, to, recover, stolen, booty, ahmad, s, victory, not, only, strengthened, his, fighting, capacity, but, also, spread, his, fame, far, and, wide, the, sultan, hearing, about, this, gathered, a, large, force, of, his, somali, followers, and, besieged, his, capital, at, siege, of, hubat, ahmad, was, unprepared, and, in, a, mountain, encampment, on, gara, muleta, the, sultan, besieged, ahmad, and, his, small, force, for, ten, days, when, he, hoped, to, starve, them, however, at, this, critical, moment, the, sheikhs, of, harar, intervened, and, reconciled, the, two, leaders, ahmad, was, forced, to, recognize, the, authority, of, the, adalite, state, for, the, first, time, in, his, career, 327, 328, this, peace, was, immediately, broken, by, abu, bakr, who, tried, to, assassinate, ahmad, while, he, was, in, harar, ahmad, fled, back, to, hubat, where, he, continued, to, struggle, against, the, sultan, at, about, this, time, a, swarm, of, bees, enlightened, on, ahmad, s, head, this, incident, was, considered, so, miraculous, that, people, gave, him, the, title, of, imam, after, much, war, the, imam, defeated, and, killed, abu, bakr, who, fled, to, the, ogaden, among, his, somali, supporters, he, then, returned, to, harar, where, he, placed, umar, din, on, the, throne, as, his, puppet, imam, ahmad, would, spend, the, next, several, months, in, subjugating, the, surrounding, somali, clans, with, diplomacy, and, war, he, had, hoped, to, unite, all, the, warring, muslim, nomads, under, his, authority, which, he, had, done, so, successfully, the, imam, was, also, able, to, start, stockpiling, on, firearms, such, as, the, matchlock, musket, cannons, and, the, arquebus, which, he, obtained, from, arabia, via, the, port, of, zeila, before, carrying, out, his, invasion, of, ethiopia, it, is, said, he, had, access, to, several, cannons, as, well, as, several, well, armed, soldiers, from, yemen, he, invited, the, somali, chiefs, of, the, area, to, participate, in, his, jihad, holy, war, against, ethiopia, besides, the, somalis, ahmad, had, also, incorporated, into, his, army, other, peoples, in, the, area, who, had, been, in, continuous, conflict, with, the, christian, empire, ever, since, the, fourteenth, century, such, as, the, harla, the, argobba, the, afar, and, the, arabs, by, about, 1527, 9, the, imam, was, at, the, head, of, a, strong, state, with, an, ever, increasing, sphere, of, influence, in, the, interior, of, the, horn, and, ready, to, lead, the, crucial, military, offensive, against, the, christian, empire, 85, the, chronicle, of, imam, ahmad, s, invasion, of, abyssinia, is, depicted, in, various, arabic, abyssinian, and, other, foreign, sources, in, 1529, imam, ahmad, finally, decided, to, embark, on, a, conquest, of, abyssinia, he, soon, met, the, abyssinians, at, the, battle, of, shimbra, kure, the, emperor, had, apparently, expected, this, confrontation, and, had, mobilized, a, large, army, to, defend, his, realms, the, troops, were, recruited, from, all, over, the, empire, and, the, list, of, christian, generals, who, participated, in, the, battle, includes, the, bahr, negash, and, other, officials, from, medri, bahri, many, district, governors, from, tigray, amhara, the, agaw, territories, begemder, gojjam, shewa, as, well, as, from, the, frontier, provinces, of, ifat, fatagar, dawaro, bali, and, damot, although, they, differ, in, the, corresponding, figures, which, they, give, both, christian, and, muslim, sources, are, unanimous, about, the, superiority, of, the, emperor, s, army, in, terms, of, the, numbers, of, soldiers, despite, the, enormous, size, of, the, abyssinians, army, the, imam, was, able, to, inflict, a, devastating, defeat, on, the, christians, and, routed, them, completely, richard, pankhurst, attributes, imam, ahmad, s, victory, to, the, presence, amongst, his, followers, of, matchlockmen, this, battle, was, probably, the, first, time, ethiopian, forces, had, to, fight, against, a, force, equipped, with, firearms, 168, he, adds, that, the, abyssinians, were, unable, to, endure, the, thunder, of, the, turkish, artillery, and, did, not, know, how, to, cure, the, wounds, which, the, bullets, made, however, the, imam, wasn, t, able, to, take, advantage, of, this, victory, immediately, due, to, tribal, infighting, within, his, army, he, was, forced, to, return, to, harar, to, resolve, disputes, between, the, different, tribes, that, made, up, his, army, he, used, this, opportunity, to, build, up, an, army, that, was, loyal, to, him, and, not, to, any, specific, tribal, leaders, finally, in, 1531, he, reconstructed, his, forces, and, was, able, to, begin, the, definite, invasion, and, occupation, of, abyssinia, with, the, help, of, his, advanced, weaponry, he, was, able, to, inflict, another, crushing, defeat, on, the, abyssinians, during, the, battle, of, antukyah, which, allowed, the, adalites, to, occupy, fatagar, and, shewa, the, imam, then, dispatched, his, somali, brother, in, law, garad, matan, to, ifat, telling, him, to, struggle, against, the, inhabitants, until, he, had, forced, them, to, submit, the, adalites, continued, to, advance, northwards, securing, the, province, of, bete, amhara, by, the, end, of, the, year, dawit, ii, fell, back, behind, the, abay, river, to, the, relative, security, of, gojjam, it, was, here, in, amhara, that, the, adalites, came, across, many, churches, and, palaces, built, by, the, abyssinians, the, imam, was, stunned, by, the, beauty, of, these, churches, and, according, to, arab, faqih, nevertheless, he, ordered, all, of, the, churches, built, by, the, abyssinians, to, be, destroyed, including, mekane, selassie, atronsa, maryam, debre, nagwadgwad, and, ganata, giyorgis, he, soon, campaigned, against, the, people, of, bali, and, dawaro, which, was, governed, by, degalhan, who, had, earlier, pillaged, adal, they, were, able, to, defeat, the, abyssinians, in, the, battle, of, amba, sel, but, this, was, quite, difficult, as, the, christians, were, able, to, inflict, serious, losses, on, the, soldiers, of, the, imam, because, they, held, the, high, ground, among, the, dead, was, the, imam, s, right, hand, man, garad, matan, the, adalites, attempted, to, capture, degalhan, but, he, was, able, to, escape, through, hadiya, for, the, next, two, years, the, adalites, would, secure, the, southern, abyssinian, provinces, of, dawaro, bali, fatagar, hadiya, and, wej, after, the, adalites, conquered, damot, and, subjugated, the, pagans, of, gafat, the, imam, marched, north, with, his, army, 145, the, imam, was, passionately, interested, in, converting, newly, occupied, territories, as, his, men, were, made, up, of, religious, zealots, but, many, of, the, conversions, were, forced, while, in, the, debre, berhan, area, the, imam, learned, that, the, locals, had, not, converted, to, islam, nor, did, they, offer, to, pay, jizya, he, then, ordered, that, anyone, who, failed, to, embrace, islam, should, be, brought, before, him, among, those, brought, before, the, imam, were, two, christian, chiefs, finding, them, adamant, in, their, faith, he, then, declared, we, have, decided, to, cut, your, heads, off, to, which, the, christians, replied, very, well, the, imam, was, surprised, but, ordered, them, to, be, put, to, death, the, imam, would, then, call, an, assembly, of, his, emirs, chieftains, and, all, the, muslim, leaders, to, state, his, intention, of, staying, in, abyssinia, they, would, then, make, plans, to, invade, tigray, where, the, emperor, now, resides, he, first, went, through, angot, where, he, was, able, to, convince, the, people, to, convert, to, islam, he, then, laid, sieged, to, the, fortress, of, amba, geshen, around, the, same, time, the, adalites, captured, the, emperor, s, niece, whom, the, imam, turned, into, his, concubine, the, imam, was, able, to, acquire, newly, purchased, cannons, imported, from, zeila, which, helped, bring, down, the, fortress, arab, faqih, states, that, thousands, of, christians, were, captured, the, imam, ordered, those, captured, to, be, beheaded, as, the, imam, marched, into, tigray, his, cousin, zaharbui, muhammad, was, killed, in, an, ambush, the, imam, grieved, over, his, death, and, the, next, day, he, set, out, with, his, army, eager, to, avenge, the, death, of, his, cousin, he, defeated, the, armies, of, agame, and, tembien, and, marched, towards, aksum, but, the, locals, of, tigray, had, all, assembled, to, defend, their, holy, city, the, imam, defeated, and, killed, a, large, number, of, them, as, arab, faqih, states, not, a, single, one, managed, to, slip, away, they, killed, them, in, the, forts, in, the, valleys, and, in, the, gorges, the, ground, was, so, thickly, covered, with, their, corpses, that, it, was, impossible, to, walk, in, that, place, because, of, the, dead, bodies, he, estimates, that, over, 10, 000, christians, were, killed, the, imam, reached, aksum, where, upon, he, destroyed, the, church, of, our, lady, mary, of, zion, while, in, aksum, a, balaw, man, informed, the, adalites, that, the, christians, had, barricaded, and, hid, themselves, near, the, abba, garima, monastery, when, the, iman, heard, this, news, he, set, out, to, find, them, when, he, found, them, he, ordered, them, to, pay, jizya, but, they, refused, so, he, massacred, them, an, army, division, from, adal, crossed, the, mareb, river, and, conquered, medri, bahri, the, subsequent, adalite, occupation, was, bitterly, resisted, by, the, locals, who, killed, the, imam, s, nephew, vizier, addole, sending, his, head, to, the, ethiopian, emperor, the, emperor, upon, receiving, it, had, drums, beaten, and, flutes, played, optimistically, declaring, that, the, fortunates, of, the, war, were, soon, turning, the, imam, enraged, at, the, death, of, his, nephew, marched, with, his, forces, into, seraye, and, massacred, the, locals, 218, 240, dawit, ii, had, fled, to, dembiya, with, his, remaining, followers, who, were, suffering, from, hunger, and, exhaustion, the, imam, pursued, the, abyssinians, until, they, crossed, the, blue, nile, 307, 308, after, this, imam, returned, to, tigray, where, he, discovered, the, region, was, undergoing, a, severe, famine, that, took, a, huge, toll, on, the, adalite, army, the, conditions, were, so, dire, that, many, muslims, in, ahmad, s, army, converted, to, christianity, realizing, the, impossibility, of, his, position, the, imam, soon, withdrew, to, the, more, fertile, province, of, begmeder, 219, upon, arriving, in, begmeder, the, imam, pacified, the, people, of, siemen, and, dembiya, the, beta, israel, assisted, the,

counterattacked, and, seemed, to, be, pushing, back, the, initial, assault, the, abyssinian, cavalry, then, threw, themselves, vigorously, into, the, adal, lines, which, pushed, the, adalites, back, the, imam, seeing, his, men, lose, ground, moved, up, to, encourage, them, it, was, here, that, the, imam, was, killed, while, attempting, to, rally, his, men, although, the, sources, differ, in, how, he, died, 80, upon, seeing, the, death, of, the, imam, his, followers, had, begun, to, flee, from, the, battlefield, what, followed, was, a, devastating, rout, as, the, abyssinians, pursued, the,

of, abyssinia, so, that, the, people, know, that, the, conqueror, who, had, wrought, them, such, evils, was, indeed, dead, the, abyssinians, then, set, up, great, festivals, across, the, country, celebrating, the, death, of, the, imam, as, castanhoso, narrates, we, remained, in, great, pleasure, seeing, each, day, the, abyssinians, delighting, in, that, victory, and, in, the, liberty, in, which, they, found, themselves, 82, muslim, sources, paint, the, imam, as, an, ascetic, and, a, model, mujahid, shihab, ad, din, notes, that, during, a, campaign, in, gendebelo, he, rejected, the, inhabitants, offers, of, gold, for, his, wife, and, rebuked, the, protests, of, his, top, lieutenants, insisting, that, the, gold, was, to, be, used, only, for, the, jihad, 38, soon, after, assuming,
