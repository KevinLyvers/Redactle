pieter, cornelis, mondriaan, dutch, after, 1906, known, as, piet, mondrian, p, i, t, m, n, d, r, i, n, also, us, m, n, dutch, 7, march, 1872, 1, february, 1944, was, a, dutch, painter, and, art, theoretician, who, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, artists, of, the, 20th, century, he, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of, 20th, century, abstract, art, as, he, changed, his, artistic, direction, from, figurative, painting, to, an, increasingly, abstract, style, until, he, reached, a, point, where, his, artistic, vocabulary, was, reduced, to, simple, geometric, elements, mondrian, s, art, was, highly, utopian, and, was, concerned, with, a, search, for, universal, values, and, aesthetics, he, proclaimed, in, 1914, art, is, higher, than, reality, and, has, no, direct, relation, to, reality, to, approach, the, spiritual, in, art, one, will, make, as, little, use, as, possible, of, reality, because, reality, is, opposed, to, the, spiritual, we, find, ourselves, in, the, presence, of, an, abstract, art, art, should, be, above, reality, otherwise, it, would, have, no, value, for, man, he, was, a, contributor, to, the, de, stijl, art, movement, and, group, which, he, co, founded, with, theo, van, doesburg, he, evolved, a, non, representational, form, which, he, termed, neoplasticism, this, was, the, new, pure, plastic, art, which, he, believed, was, necessary, in, order, to, create, universal, beauty, to, express, this, mondrian, eventually, decided, to, limit, his, formal, vocabulary, to, the, three, primary, colors, red, blue, and, yellow, the, three, primary, values, black, white, and, gray, and, the, two, primary, directions, horizontal, and, vertical, mondrian, s, arrival, in, paris, from, the, netherlands, in, 1911, marked, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, profound, change, he, encountered, experiments, in, cubism, and, with, the, intent, of, integrating, himself, within, the, parisian, avant, garde, removed, an, a, from, the, dutch, spelling, of, his, name, mondriaan, mondrian, s, work, had, an, enormous, influence, on, 20th, century, art, influencing, not, only, the, course, of, abstract, painting, and, numerous, major, styles, and, art, movements, e, g, color, field, painting, abstract, expressionism, and, minimalism, but, also, fields, outside, the, domain, of, painting, such, as, design, architecture, and, fashion, design, historian, stephen, bayley, said, mondrian, has, come, to, mean, modernism, his, name, and, his, work, sum, up, the, high, modernist, ideal, i, don, t, like, the, word, iconic, so, let, s, say, that, he, s, become, totemic, a, totem, for, everything, modernism, set, out, to, be, mondrian, was, born, in, amersfoort, province, of, utrecht, in, the, netherlands, the, second, of, his, parents, children, he, was, descended, from, christian, dirkzoon, monderyan, who, lived, in, the, hague, as, early, as, 1670, the, family, moved, to, winterswijk, when, his, father, pieter, cornelius, mondriaan, was, appointed, head, teacher, at, a, local, primary, school, mondrian, was, introduced, to, art, from, an, early, age, his, father, was, a, qualified, drawing, teacher, and, with, his, uncle, frits, mondriaan, a, pupil, of, willem, maris, of, the, hague, school, of, artists, the, younger, piet, often, painted, and, drew, along, the, river, gein, after, a, strict, protestant, upbringing, in, 1892, mondrian, entered, the, academy, for, fine, art, in, amsterdam, he, was, already, qualified, as, a, teacher, he, began, his, career, as, a, teacher, in, primary, education, but, he, also, practiced, painting, most, of, his, work, from, this, period, is, naturalistic, or, impressionistic, consisting, largely, of, landscapes, these, pastoral, images, of, his, native, country, depict, windmills, fields, and, rivers, initially, in, the, dutch, impressionist, manner, of, the, hague, school, and, then, in, a, variety, of, styles, and, techniques, that, attest, to, his, search, for, a, personal, style, these, paintings, are, representational, and, they, illustrate, the, influence, that, various, artistic, movements, had, on, mondrian, including, pointillism, and, the, vivid, colors, of, fauvism, in, 1893, he, had, his, first, exhibition, on, display, in, the, kunstmuseum, den, haag, are, a, number, of, paintings, from, this, period, including, such, post, impressionist, works, as, the, red, mill, and, trees, in, moonrise, another, painting, evening, avond, 1908, depicting, a, tree, in, a, field, at, dusk, even, augurs, future, developments, by, using, a, palette, consisting, almost, entirely, of, red, yellow, and, blue, although, avond, is, only, limitedly, abstract, it, is, the, earliest, mondrian, painting, to, emphasize, primary, colors, mondrian, s, earliest, paintings, showing, a, degree, of, abstraction, are, a, series, of, canvases, from, 1905, to, 1908, that, depict, dim, scenes, of, indistinct, trees, and, houses, reflected, in, still, water, although, the, result, leads, the, viewer, to, begin, focusing, on, the, forms, over, the, content, these, paintings, are, still, firmly, rooted, in, nature, and, it, is, only, the, knowledge, of, mondrian, s, later, achievements, that, leads, one, to, search, in, these, works, for, the, roots, of, his, future, abstraction, mondrian, s, art, was, intimately, related, to, his, spiritual, and, philosophical, studies, in, 1908, he, became, interested, in, the, theosophical, movement, launched, by, helena, petrovna, blavatsky, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, in, 1909, he, joined, the, dutch, branch, of, the, theosophical, society, the, work, of, blavatsky, and, a, parallel, spiritual, movement, rudolf, steiner, s, anthroposophy, significantly, affected, the, further, development, of, his, aesthetic, blavatsky, believed, that, it, was, possible, to, attain, a, more, profound, knowledge, of, nature, than, that, provided, by, empirical, means, and, much, of, mondrian, s, work, for, the, rest, of, his, life, was, inspired, by, his, search, for, that, spiritual, knowledge, in, 1918, he, wrote, i, got, everything, from, the, secret, doctrine, referring, to, a, book, written, by, blavatsky, in, 1921, in, a, letter, to, steiner, mondrian, argued, that, his, neoplasticism, was, the, art, of, the, foreseeable, future, for, all, true, anthroposophists, and, theosophists, he, remained, a, committed, theosophist, in, subsequent, years, although, he, also, believed, that, his, own, artistic, current, neoplasticism, would, eventually, become, part, of, a, larger, ecumenical, spirituality, mondrian, and, his, later, work, were, deeply, influenced, by, the, 1911, moderne, kunstkring, exhibition, of, cubism, in, amsterdam, his, search, for, simplification, is, shown, in, two, versions, of, still, life, with, ginger, pot, stilleven, met, gemberpot, the, 1911, version, is, cubist, in, the, 1912, version, the, objects, are, reduced, to, a, round, shape, with, triangles, and, rectangles, in, 1911, mondrian, moved, to, paris, and, changed, his, name, dropping, an, a, from, mondriaan, to, emphasize, his, departure, from, the, netherlands, and, his, integration, within, the, parisian, avant, garde, while, in, paris, the, influence, of, the, cubist, style, of, pablo, picasso, and, georges, braque, appeared, almost, immediately, in, mondrian, s, work, paintings, such, as, the, sea, 1912, and, his, various, studies, of, trees, from, that, year, still, contain, a, measure, of, representation, but, increasingly, they, are, dominated, by, geometric, shapes, and, interlocking, planes, while, mondrian, was, eager, to, absorb, the, cubist, influence, into, his, work, it, seems, clear, that, he, saw, cubism, as, a, port, of, call, on, his, artistic, journey, rather, than, as, a, destination, piet, mondrian, s, cubist, period, lasted, from, 1912, to, 1917, unlike, the, cubists, mondrian, still, attempted, to, reconcile, his, painting, with, his, spiritual, pursuits, and, in, 1913, he, began, to, fuse, his, art, and, his, theosophical, studies, into, a, theory, that, signaled, his, final, break, from, representational, painting, while, mondrian, was, visiting, the, netherlands, in, 1914, world, war, i, began, forcing, him, to, remain, there, for, the, duration, of, the, conflict, during, this, period, he, stayed, at, the, laren, artists, colony, where, he, met, bart, van, der, leck, and, theo, van, doesburg, who, were, both, undergoing, their, own, personal, journeys, toward, abstraction, van, der, leck, s, use, of, only, primary, colors, in, his, art, greatly, influenced, mondrian, after, a, meeting, with, van, der, leck, in, 1916, mondrian, wrote, my, technique, which, was, more, or, less, cubist, and, therefore, more, or, less, pictorial, came, under, the, influence, of, his, precise, method, with, van, doesburg, mondrian, founded, de, stijl, the, style, a, journal, of, the, de, stijl, group, in, which, he, first, published, essays, defining, his, theory, which, he, called, neoplasticism, mondrian, published, de, nieuwe, beelding, in, de, schilderkunst, the, new, visualisation, in, painting, in, twelve, installments, during, 1917, and, 1918, this, was, his, first, major, attempt, to, express, his, artistic, theory, in, writing, mondrian, s, best, and, most, often, quoted, expression, of, this, theory, however, comes, from, a, letter, he, wrote, to, h, p, bremmer, in, 1914, i, construct, lines, and, color, combinations, on, a, flat, surface, in, order, to, express, general, beauty, with, the, utmost, awareness, nature, or, that, which, i, see, inspires, me, puts, me, as, with, any, painter, in, an, emotional, state, so, that, an, urge, comes, about, to, make, something, but, i, want, to, come, as, close, as, possible, to, the, truth, and, abstract, everything, from, that, until, i, reach, the, foundation, still, just, an, external, foundation, of, things, i, believe, it, is, possible, that, through, horizontal, and, vertical, lines, constructed, with, awareness, but, not, with, calculation, led, by, high, intuition, and, brought, to, harmony, and, rhythm, these, basic, forms, of, beauty, supplemented, if, necessary, by, other, direct, lines, or, curves, can, become, a, work, of, art, as, strong, as, it, is, true, over, the, next, two, decades, mondrian, methodically, developed, his, signature, style, embracing, the, classical, platonic, euclidean, worldview, where, he, simply, focused, on, his, now, iconic, horizontal, and, vertical, black, lines, forming, squares, and, rectangles, filled, with, primary, hues, when, world, war, i, ended, in, 1918, mondrian, returned, to, france, where, he, would, remain, until, 1938, immersed, in, post, war, paris, culture, of, artistic, innovation, he, flourished, and, fully, embraced, the, art, of, pure, abstraction, for, the, rest, of, his, life, mondrian, began, producing, grid, based, paintings, in, late, 1919, and, in, 1920, the, style, for, which, he, came, to, be, renowned, began, to, appear, mondrian, believed, that, pure, abstract, art, becomes, completely, emancipated, free, of, naturalistic, appearances, it, is, no, longer, natural, harmony, but, creates, equivalent, relationships, the, realization, of, equivalent, relationships, is, of, the, highest, importance, for, life, in, the, early, paintings, of, this, style, the, lines, delineating, the, rectangular, forms, are, relatively, thin, and, they, are, gray, not, black, the, lines, also, tend, to, fade, as, they, approach, the, edge, of, the, painting, rather, than, stopping, abruptly, the, forms, themselves, smaller, and, more, numerous, than, in, later, paintings, are, filled, with, primary, colors, black, or, gray, and, nearly, all, of, them, are, colored, only, a, few, are, left, white, during, late, 1920, and, 1921, mondrian, s, paintings, arrive, at, what, is, to, casual, observers, their, definitive, and, mature, form, thick, black, lines, now, separate, the, forms, which, are, larger, and, fewer, in, number, and, more, of, the, forms, are, left, white, this, was, not, the, culmination, of, his, artistic, evolution, however, although, the, refinements, became, subtler, mondrian, s, work, continued, to, evolve, during, his, years, in, paris, in, the, 1921, paintings, many, though, not, all, of, the, black, lines, stop, short, at, a, seemingly, arbitrary, distance, from, the, edge, of, the, canvas, although, the, divisions, between, the, rectangular, forms, remain, intact, here, too, the, rectangular, forms, remain, mostly, colored, as, the, years, passed, and, mondrian, s, work, evolved, further, he, began, extending, all, of, the, lines, to, the, edges, of, the, canvas, and, he, began, to, use, fewer, and, fewer, colored, forms, favoring, white, instead, these, tendencies, are, particularly, obvious, in, the, lozenge, works, that, mondrian, began, producing, with, regularity, in, the, mid, 1920s, the, lozenge, paintings, are, square, canvases, tilted, 45, degrees, so, that, they, have, a, diamond, shape, typical, of, these, is, schilderij, no, 1, lozenge, with, two, lines, and, blue, 1926, one, of, the, most, minimal, of, mondrian, s, canvases, this, painting, consists, only, of, two, black, perpendicular, lines, and, a, small, blue, triangular, form, the, lines, extend, all, the, way, to, the, edges, of, the, canvas, almost, giving, the, impression, that, the, painting, is, a, fragment, of, a, larger, work, although, one, s, view, of, the, painting, is, hampered, by, the, glass, protecting, it, and, by, the, toll, that, age, and, handling, have, obviously, taken, on, the, canvas, a, close, examination, of, this, painting, begins, to, reveal, something, of, the, artist, s, method, the, painting, is, not, composed, of, perfectly, flat, planes, of, color, as, one, might, expect, subtle, brush, strokes, are, evident, throughout, the, artist, appears, to, have, used, different, techniques, for, the, various, elements, the, black, lines, are, the, flattest, elements, with, the, least, depth, the, colored, forms, have, the, most, obvious, brush, strokes, all, running, in, one, direction, most, interesting, however, are, the, white, forms, which, clearly, have, been, painted, in, layers, using, brush, strokes, running, in, different, directions, this, generates, a, greater, sense, of, depth, in, the, white, forms, so, that, they, appear, to, overwhelm, the, lines, and, the, colors, which, indeed, they, were, doing, as, mondrian, s, paintings, of, this, period, came, to, be, increasingly, dominated, by, white, space, in, 1926, katherine, dreier, co, founder, of, new, york, city, s, society, of, independent, artists, along, with, marcel, duchamp, and, man, ray, visited, piet, mondrian, s, studio, in, paris, and, acquired, one, of, his, diamond, compositions, painting, i, this, was, then, shown, during, an, exhibition, organized, by, the, society, of, independent, artists, in, the, brooklyn, museum, the, first, major, exhibition, of, modern, art, in, america, since, the, armory, show, she, stated, in, the, catalog, that, holland, has, produced, three, great, painters, who, though, a, logical, expression, of, their, own, country, rose, above, it, through, the, vigor, of, their, personality, the, first, was, rembrandt, the, second, was, van, gogh, and, the, third, is, mondrian, as, the, years, progressed, lines, began, to, take, precedence, over, forms, in, mondrian, s, paintings, in, the, 1930s, he, began, to, use, thinner, lines, and, double, lines, more, frequently, punctuated, with, a, few, small, colored, forms, if, any, at, all, double, lines, particularly, excited, mondrian, for, he, believed, they, offered, his, paintings, a, new, dynamism, which, he, was, eager, to, explore, the, introduction, of, the, double, line, in, his, work, was, influenced, by, the, work, of, his, friend, and, contemporary, marlow, moss, from, 1934, to, 1935, three, of, mondrian, s, paintings, were, exhibited, as, part, of, the, abstract, and, concrete, exhibitions, in, the, uk, at, oxford, london, and, liverpool, in, september, 1938, mondrian, left, paris, in, the, face, of, advancing, fascism, and, moved, to, london, after, the, netherlands, was, invaded, and, paris, fell, in, 1940, he, left, london, for, manhattan, in, new, york, city, where, he, would, remain, until, his, death, some, of, mondrian, s, later, works, are, difficult, to, place, in, terms, of, his, artistic, development, because, there, were, quite, a, few, canvases, that, he, began, in, paris, or, london, and, only, completed, months, or, years, later, in, manhattan, the, finished, works, from, this, later, period, are, visually, busy, with, more, lines, than, any, of, his, work, since, the, 1920s, placed, in, an, overlapping, arrangement, that, is, almost, cartographical, in, appearance, he, spent, many, long, hours, painting, on, his, own, until, his, hands, blistered, and, he, sometimes, cried, or, made, himself, sick, mondrian, produced, lozenge, composition, with, four, yellow, lines, 1933, a, simple, painting, that, innovated, thick, colored, lines, instead, of, black, ones, after, that, one, painting, this, practice, remained, dormant, in, mondrian, s, work, until, he, arrived, in, manhattan, at, which, time, he, began, to, embrace, it, with, abandon, in, some, examples, of, this, new, direction, such, as, composition, 1938, place, de, la, concorde, 1943, he, appears, to, have, taken, unfinished, black, line, paintings, from, paris, and, completed, them, in, new, york, by, adding, short, perpendicular, lines, of, different, colors, running, between, the, longer, black, lines, or, from, a, black, line, to, the, edge, of, the, canvas, the, newly, colored, areas, are, thick, almost, bridging, the, gap, between, lines, and, forms, and, it, is, startling, to, see, color, in, a, mondrian, painting, that, is, unbounded, by, black, other, works, mix, long, lines, of, red, amidst, the, familiar, black, lines, creating, a, new, sense, of, depth, by, the, addition, of, a, colored, layer, on, top, of, the, black, one, his, painting, composition, no, 10, 1939, 1942, characterized, by, primary, colors, white, ground, and, black, grid, lines, clearly, defined, mondrian, s, radical, but, classical, approach, to, the, rectangle, on, 23, september, 1940, mondrian, left, europe, for, new, york, aboard, the, cunard, white, star, line, ship, rms, samaria, 1920, departing, from, liverpool, the, new, canvases, that, mondrian, began, in, manhattan, are, even, more, startling, and, indicate, the, beginning, of, a, new, idiom, that, was, cut, short, by, the, artist, s, death, new, york, city, 1942, is, a, complex, lattice, of, red, blue, and, yellow, lines, occasionally, interlacing, to, create, a, greater, sense, of, depth, than, his, previous, works, an, unfinished, 1941, version, of, this, work, titled, new, york, city, i, uses, strips, of, painted, paper, tape, which, the, artist, could, rearrange, at, will, to, experiment, with, different, designs, in, october, 2022, it, was, revealed, that, the, work, which, was, first, displayed, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, in, new, york, in, 1945, had, been, displayed, upside, down, since, at, least, 1980, at, the, kunstsammlung, nordrhein, westfalen, in, germany, where, it, is, now, held, the, gallery, explained, that, it, would, continue, to, display, it, the, wrong, way, up, to, avoid, damaging, it, his, painting, broadway, boogie, woogie, 1942, 43, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, was, highly, influential, in, the, school, of, abstract, geometric, painting, the, piece, is, made, up, of, a, number, of, shimmering, squares, of, bright, color, that, leap, from, the, canvas, then, appear, to, shimmer, drawing, the, viewer, into, those, neon, lights, in, this, painting, and, the, unfinished, victory, boogie, woogie, 1942, 1944, mondrian, replaced, former, solid, lines, with, lines, created, from, small, adjoining, rectangles, of, color, created, in, part, by, using, small, pieces, of, paper, tape, in, various, colors, larger, unbounded, rectangles, of, color, punctuate, the, design, some, with, smaller, concentric, rectangles, inside, them, while, mondrian, s, works, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, tend, to, have, an, almost, scientific, austerity, about, them, these, are, bright, lively, paintings, reflecting, the, upbeat, music, that, inspired, them, and, the, city, in, which, they, were, made, in, these, final, works, the, forms, have, indeed, usurped, the, role, of, the, lines, opening, another, new, door, for, mondrian, s, development, as, an, abstractionist, the, boogie, woogie, paintings, were, clearly, more, of, a, revolutionary, change, than, an, evolutionary, one, representing, the, most, profound, development, in, mondrian, s, work, since, his, abandonment, of, representational, art, in, 1913, in, 2008, the, dutch, television, program, andere, tijden, found, the, only, known, movie, footage, with, mondrian, the, discovery, of, the, film, footage, was, announced, at, the, end, of, a, two, year, research, program, on, the, victory, boogie, woogie, the, research, found, that, the, painting, was, in, very, good, condition, and, that, mondrian, painted, the, composition, in, one, session, it, also, was, found, that, the, composition, was, changed, radically, by, mondrian, shortly, before, his, death, by, using, small, pieces, of, colored, tape, when, the, 47, year, old, piet, mondrian, left, the, netherlands, for, unfettered, paris, for, the, second, and, last, time, in, 1919, he, set, about, at, once, to, make, his, studio, a, nurturing, environment, for, paintings, he, had, in, mind, that, would, increasingly, express, the, principles, of, neoplasticism, about, which, he, had, been, writing, for, two, years, to, hide, the, studio, s, structural, flaws, quickly, and, inexpensively, he, tacked, up, large, rectangular, placards, each, in, a, single, color, or, neutral, hue, smaller, colored, paper, squares, and, rectangles, composed, together, accented, the, walls, then, came, an, intense, period, of, painting, again, he, addressed, the, walls, repositioning, the, colored, cutouts, adding, to, their, number, altering, the, dynamics, of, color, and, space, producing, new, tensions, and, equilibrium, before, long, he, had, established, a, creative, schedule, in, which, a, period, of, painting, took, turns, with, a, period, of, experimentally, regrouping, the, smaller, papers, on, the, walls, a, process, that, directly, fed, the, next, period, of, painting, it, was, a, pattern, he, followed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, through, wartime, moves, from, paris, to, london, s, hampstead, in, 1938, and, 1940, across, the, atlantic, to, manhattan, at, the, age, of, 71, in, the, fall, of, 1943, mondrian, moved, into, his, second, and, final, manhattan, studio, at, 15, east, 59th, street, and, set, about, to, recreate, the, environment, he, had, learned, over, the, years, was, most, congenial, to, his, modest, way, of, life, and, most, stimulating, to, his, art, he, painted, the, high, walls, the, same, off, white, he, used, on, his, easel, and, on, the, seats, tables, and, storage, cases, he, designed, and, fashioned, meticulously, from, discarded, orange, and, apple, crates, he, glossed, the, top, of, a, white, metal, stool, in, the, same, brilliant, primary, red, he, applied, to, the, cardboard, sheath, he, made, for, the, radio, phonograph, that, spilled, forth, his, beloved, jazz, from, well, traveled, records, visitors, to, this, last, studio, seldom, saw, more, than, one, or, two, new, canvases, but, found, often, to, their, astonishment, that, eight, large, compositions, of, colored, bits, of, paper, he, had, tacked, and, re, tacked, to, the, walls, in, ever, changing, relationships, constituted, together, an, environment, that, paradoxically, and, simultaneously, was, both, kinetic, and, serene, stimulating, and, restful, it, was, the, best, space, mondrian, said, that, he, had, inhabited, he, was, there, for, only, a, few, months, as, he, died, in, february, 1944, after, his, death, mondrian, s, friend, and, sponsor, in, manhattan, artist, harry, holtzman, and, another, painter, friend, fritz, glarner, carefully, documented, the, studio, on, film, and, in, still, photographs, before, opening, it, to, the, public, for, a, six, week, exhibition, before, dismantling, the, studio, holtzman, who, was, also, mondrian, s, heir, traced, the, wall, compositions, precisely, prepared, exact, portable, facsimiles, of, the, space, each, had, occupied, and,
