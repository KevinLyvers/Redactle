as, depicted, in, his, string, trio, 1946, as, the, world, learned, of, the, holocaust, he, memorialized, its, victims, in, a, survivor, from, warsaw, 1947, the, israel, conservatory, and, academy, of, music, elected, him, honorary, president, 1951, his, innovative, music, was, among, the, most, influential, and, polemicized, of, 20th, century, classical, music, at, least, three, generations, of, composers, extended, its, somewhat, formal, principles, his, aesthetic, and, music, historical, views, influenced, musicologists, theodor, w, adorno, and, carl, dahlhaus, the, arnold, sch, nberg, center, collects, his, archival, legacy, arnold, schoenberg, was, born, into, a, lower, middle, class, jewish, family, in, the, leopoldstadt, district, in, earlier, times, a, jewish, ghetto, of, vienna, at, obere, donaustra, e, 5, his, father, samuel, a, native, of, sz, cs, ny, hungary, later, moved, to, pozsony, pressburg, at, that, time, part, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, now, bratislava, slovakia, and, then, to, vienna, was, a, shoe, shopkeeper, and, his, mother, pauline, schoenberg, n, e, nachod, a, native, of, prague, was, a, piano, teacher, arnold, was, largely, self, taught, he, took, only, counterpoint, lessons, with, the, composer, alexander, zemlinsky, who, was, to, become, his, first, brother, in, law, in, his, twenties, schoenberg, earned, a, living, by, orchestrating, operettas, while, composing, his, own, works, such, as, the, string, sextet, verkl, rte, nacht, transfigured, night, 1899, he, later, made, an, orchestral, version, of, this, which, became, one, of, his, most, popular, pieces, both, richard, strauss, and, gustav, mahler, recognized, schoenberg, s, significance, as, a, composer, strauss, when, he, encountered, schoenberg, s, gurre, lieder, and, mahler, after, hearing, several, of, schoenberg, s, early, works, strauss, turned, to, a, more, conservative, idiom, in, his, own, work, after, 1909, and, at, that, point, dismissed, schoenberg, mahler, adopted, him, as, a, prot, g, and, continued, to, support, him, even, after, schoenberg, s, style, reached, a, point, mahler, could, no, longer, understand, mahler, worried, about, who, would, look, after, him, after, his, death, schoenberg, who, had, initially, despised, and, mocked, mahler, s, music, was, converted, by, the, thunderbolt, of, mahler, s, third, symphony, which, he, considered, a, work, of, genius, afterward, he, spoke, of, mahler, as, a, saint, in, 1898, schoenberg, converted, to, christianity, in, the, lutheran, church, according, to, macdonald, 2008, 93, this, was, partly, to, strengthen, his, attachment, to, western, european, cultural, traditions, and, partly, as, a, means, of, self, defence, in, a, time, of, resurgent, anti, semitism, in, 1933, after, long, meditation, he, returned, to, judaism, because, he, realised, that, his, racial, and, religious, heritage, was, inescapable, and, to, take, up, an, unmistakable, position, on, the, side, opposing, nazism, he, would, self, identify, as, a, member, of, the, jewish, religion, later, in, life, in, october, 1901, schoenberg, married, mathilde, zemlinsky, the, sister, of, the, conductor, and, composer, alexander, von, zemlinsky, with, whom, schoenberg, had, been, studying, since, about, 1894, schoenberg, and, mathilde, had, two, children, gertrud, 1902, 1947, and, georg, 1906, 1974, gertrud, would, marry, schoenberg, s, pupil, felix, greissle, in, 1921, during, the, summer, of, 1908, schoenberg, s, wife, mathilde, left, him, for, several, months, for, a, young, austrian, painter, richard, gerstl, who, committed, suicide, in, that, november, after, mathilde, returned, to, her, marriage, this, period, marked, a, distinct, change, in, schoenberg, s, work, it, was, during, the, absence, of, his, wife, that, he, composed, you, lean, against, a, silver, willow, german, du, lehnest, wider, eine, silberweide, the, thirteenth, song, in, the, cycle, das, buch, der, h, ngenden, g, rten, op, 15, based, on, the, collection, of, the, same, name, by, the, german, mystical, poet, stefan, george, this, was, the, first, composition, without, any, reference, at, all, to, a, key, also, in, this, year, schoenberg, completed, one, of, his, most, revolutionary, compositions, the, string, quartet, no, 2, the, first, two, movements, though, chromatic, in, color, use, traditional, key, signatures, the, final, two, movements, again, using, poetry, by, george, incorporate, a, soprano, vocal, line, breaking, with, previous, string, quartet, practice, and, daringly, weaken, the, links, with, traditional, tonality, both, movements, end, on, tonic, chords, and, the, work, is, not, fully, non, tonal, during, the, summer, of, 1910, schoenberg, wrote, his, harmonielehre, theory, of, harmony, schoenberg, 1922, which, remains, one, of, the, most, influential, music, theory, books, from, about, 1911, schoenberg, belonged, to, a, circle, of, artists, and, intellectuals, who, included, lene, schneider, kainer, franz, werfel, herwarth, walden, and, else, lasker, sch, ler, in, 1910, he, met, edward, clark, an, english, music, journalist, then, working, in, germany, clark, became, his, sole, english, student, and, in, his, later, capacity, as, a, producer, for, the, bbc, he, was, responsible, for, introducing, many, of, schoenberg, s, works, and, schoenberg, himself, to, britain, as, well, as, webern, berg, and, others, another, of, his, most, important, works, from, this, atonal, or, pantonal, period, is, the, highly, influential, pierrot, lunaire, op, 21, of, 1912, a, novel, cycle, of, expressionist, songs, set, to, a, german, translation, of, poems, by, the, belgian, french, poet, albert, giraud, utilizing, the, technique, of, sprechstimme, or, melodramatically, spoken, recitation, the, work, pairs, a, female, vocalist, with, a, small, ensemble, of, five, musicians, the, ensemble, which, is, now, commonly, referred, to, as, the, pierrot, ensemble, consists, of, flute, doubling, on, piccolo, clarinet, doubling, on, bass, clarinet, violin, doubling, on, viola, violoncello, speaker, and, piano, wilhelm, bopp, director, of, the, vienna, conservatory, from, 1907, wanted, a, break, from, the, stale, environment, personified, for, him, by, robert, fuchs, and, hermann, graedener, having, considered, many, candidates, he, offered, teaching, positions, to, schoenberg, and, franz, schreker, in, 1912, at, the, time, schoenberg, lived, in, berlin, he, was, not, completely, cut, off, from, the, vienna, conservatory, having, taught, a, private, theory, course, a, year, earlier, he, seriously, considered, the, offer, but, he, declined, writing, afterward, to, alban, berg, he, cited, his, aversion, to, vienna, as, the, main, reason, for, his, decision, while, contemplating, that, it, might, have, been, the, wrong, one, financially, but, having, made, it, he, felt, content, a, couple, of, months, later, he, wrote, to, schreker, suggesting, that, it, might, have, been, a, bad, idea, for, him, as, well, to, accept, the, teaching, position, world, war, i, brought, a, crisis, in, his, development, military, service, disrupted, his, life, when, at, the, age, of, 42, he, was, in, the, army, he, was, never, able, to, work, uninterrupted, or, over, a, period, of, time, and, as, a, result, he, left, many, unfinished, works, and, undeveloped, beginnings, on, one, occasion, a, superior, officer, demanded, to, know, if, he, was, this, notorious, schoenberg, then, schoenberg, replied, beg, to, report, sir, yes, nobody, wanted, to, be, someone, had, to, be, so, i, let, it, be, me, according, to, norman, lebrecht, this, is, a, reference, to, schoenberg, s, apparent, destiny, as, the, emancipator, of, dissonance, schoenberg, drew, comparisons, between, germany, s, assault, on, france, and, his, assault, on, decadent, bourgeois, artistic, values, in, august, 1914, while, denouncing, the, music, of, bizet, stravinsky, and, ravel, he, wrote, now, comes, the, reckoning, now, we, will, throw, these, mediocre, kitschmongers, into, slavery, and, teach, them, to, venerate, the, german, spirit, and, to, worship, the, german, god, alex, ross, described, this, as, an, act, of, war, psychosis, the, deteriorating, relation, between, contemporary, composers, and, the, public, led, him, to, found, the, society, for, private, musical, performances, verein, f, r, musikalische, privatauff, hrungen, in, german, in, vienna, in, 1918, he, sought, to, provide, a, forum, in, which, modern, musical, compositions, could, be, carefully, prepared, and, rehearsed, and, properly, performed, under, conditions, protected, from, the, dictates, of, fashion, and, pressures, of, commerce, from, its, inception, until, its, dissolution, amid, austrian, hyperinflation, the, society, presented, 353, performances, to, paying, members, sometimes, weekly, during, the, first, year, and, a, half, schoenberg, did, not, let, any, of, his, own, works, be, performed, instead, audiences, at, the, society, s, concerts, heard, difficult, contemporary, compositions, by, scriabin, debussy, mahler, webern, berg, reger, and, other, leading, figures, of, early, 20th, century, music, later, schoenberg, was, to, develop, the, most, influential, version, of, the, dodecaphonic, also, known, as, twelve, tone, method, of, composition, which, in, french, and, english, was, given, the, alternative, name, serialism, by, ren, leibowitz, and, humphrey, searle, in, 1947, this, technique, was, taken, up, by, many, of, his, students, who, constituted, the, so, called, second, viennese, school, they, included, anton, webern, alban, berg, and, hanns, eisler, all, of, whom, were, profoundly, influenced, by, schoenberg, he, published, a, number, of, books, ranging, from, his, famous, harmonielehre, theory, of, harmony, to, fundamentals, of, musical, composition, many, of, which, are, still, in, print, and, used, by, musicians, and, developing, composers, schoenberg, viewed, his, development, as, a, natural, progression, and, he, did, not, deprecate, his, earlier, works, when, he, ventured, into, serialism, in, 1923, he, wrote, to, the, swiss, philanthropist, werner, reinhart, for, the, present, it, matters, more, to, me, if, people, understand, my, older, works, they, are, the, natural, forerunners, of, my, later, works, and, only, those, who, understand, and, comprehend, these, will, be, able, to, gain, an, understanding, of, the, later, works, that, goes, beyond, a, fashionable, bare, minimum, i, do, not, attach, so, much, importance, to, being, a, musical, bogey, man, as, to, being, a, natural, continuer, of, properly, understood, good, old, tradition, his, first, wife, died, in, october, 1923, and, in, august, of, the, next, year, schoenberg, married, gertrud, kolisch, 1898, 1967, sister, of, his, pupil, the, violinist, rudolf, kolisch, they, had, three, children, nuria, dorothea, born, 1932, ronald, rudolf, born, 1937, and, lawrence, adam, born, 1941, gertrude, kolisch, schoenberg, wrote, the, libretto, for, schoenberg, s, one, act, opera, von, heute, auf, morgen, under, the, pseudonym, max, blonda, at, her, request, schoenberg, s, ultimately, unfinished, piece, die, jakobsleiter, was, prepared, for, performance, by, schoenberg, s, student, winfried, zillig, after, her, husband, s, death, in, 1951, she, founded, belmont, music, publishers, devoted, to, the, publication, of, his, works, arnold, used, the, notes, g, and, e, german, es, i, e, s, for, gertrud, schoenberg, in, the, suite, for, septet, op, 29, 1925, see, musical, cryptogram, following, the, death, in, 1924, of, composer, ferruccio, busoni, who, had, served, as, director, of, a, master, class, in, composition, at, the, prussian, academy, of, arts, in, berlin, schoenberg, was, appointed, to, this, post, the, next, year, but, because, of, health, problems, was, unable, to, take, up, his, post, until, 1926, among, his, notable, students, during, this, period, were, the, composers, robert, gerhard, nikos, skalkottas, and, josef, rufer, along, with, his, twelve, tone, works, 1930, marks, schoenberg, s, return, to, tonality, with, numbers, 4, and, 6, of, the, six, pieces, for, male, chorus, op, 35, the, other, pieces, being, dodecaphonic, schoenberg, continued, in, his, post, until, the, nazis, seized, power, in, 1933, while, on, vacation, in, france, he, was, warned, that, returning, to, germany, would, be, dangerous, schoenberg, formally, reclaimed, membership, in, the, jewish, religion, at, a, paris, synagogue, then, emigrated, to, the, united, states, with, his, family, he, subsequently, gave, brief, consideration, to, moving, again, either, to, england, or, the, soviet, union, his, first, teaching, position, in, the, united, states, was, at, the, malkin, conservatory, boston, university, he, moved, to, los, angeles, where, he, taught, at, the, university, of, southern, california, and, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, both, of, which, later, named, a, music, building, on, their, respective, campuses, schoenberg, hall, he, was, appointed, visiting, professor, at, ucla, in, 1935, on, the, recommendation, of, otto, klemperer, music, director, and, conductor, of, the, los, angeles, philharmonic, orchestra, and, the, next, year, was, promoted, to, professor, at, a, salary, of, 5, 100, per, year, which, enabled, him, in, either, may, 1936, or, 1937, to, buy, a, spanish, revival, house, at, 116, north, rockingham, in, brentwood, park, near, the, ucla, campus, for, 18, 000, this, address, was, directly, across, the, street, from, shirley, temple, s, house, and, there, he, befriended, fellow, composer, and, tennis, partner, george, gershwin, the, schoenbergs, were, able, to, employ, domestic, help, and, began, holding, sunday, afternoon, gatherings, that, were, known, for, excellent,

edward, b, powell, studied, with, schoenberg, at, this, time, after, his, move, to, the, united, states, where, he, arrived, on, 31, october, 1933, the, composer, used, the, alternative, spelling, of, his, surname, schoenberg, rather, than, sch, nberg, in, what, he, called, deference, to, american, practice, though, according, to, one, writer, he, first, made, the, change, a, year, earlier, he, lived, there, the, rest, of, his, life, but, at, first, he, was, not, settled, in, 1934, he, applied, for, a, teacher, of, harmony, and, theory, position, at, the, new, south, wales, state, conservatorium, in, sydney, vincent, plush, discovered, his, application, in, the, 1970s, it, bore, two, notes, in, different, handwriting, jewish, in, one, and, modernist, ideas, and, dangerous, tendencies, in, another, marked, e, b, edgar, bainton, schoenberg, also, explored, the, idea, of, emigrating, to, new, zealand, his, secretary, and, student, richard, hoffmann, the, nephew, of, schoenberg, s, mother, in, law, henriette, kolisch, lived, in, new, zealand, in, 1935, 1947, schoenberg, had, since, childhood, been, fascinated, with, islands, and, with, new, zealand, in, particular, possibly, because, of, its, postage, stamps, he, abandoned, the, idea, of, moving, to, new, zealand, after, his, health, began, to, decline, in, 1944, during, this, final, period, he, composed, several, notable, works, including, the, difficult, violin, concerto, op, 36, 1934, 36, the, kol, nidre, op, 39, for, chorus, and, orchestra, 1938, the, ode, to, napoleon, buonaparte, op,

moses, und, aron, 1932, 33, which, was, one, of, the, first, works, of, its, genre, written, completely, using, dodecaphonic, composition, along, with, twelve, tone, music, schoenberg, also, returned, to, tonality, with, works, during, his, last, period, like, the, suite, for, strings, in, g, major, 1935, the, chamber, symphony, no, 2, in, e, minor, op, 38, begun, in, 1906, completed, in, 1939, the, variations, on, a, recitative, in, d, minor, op, 40, 1941, during, this, period, his, notable, students, included, john, cage, and, lou, harrison, in, 1941, he, became, a, citizen, of, the, united, states, here, he, was, the, first, composer, in, residence, at, the, music, academy, of, the, west, summer, conservatory, schoenberg, s, superstitious, nature, may, have, triggered, his, death, the, composer, had, triskaidekaphobia, and, according, to, friend, katia, mann, he, feared, he, would, die, during, a, year, that, was, a, multiple, of, 13, this, possibly, began, in, 1908, with, the, composition, of, the, thirteenth, song, of, the, song, cycle, das, buch, der, h, ngenden, g, rten, op, 15, he, dreaded, his, sixty, fifth, birthday, in, 1939, so, much, that, a, friend, asked, the, composer, and, astrologer, dane, rudhyar, to, prepare, schoenberg, s, horoscope, rudhyar, did, this, and, told, schoenberg, that, the, year, was, dangerous, but, not, fatal, but, in, 1950, on, his, 76th, birthday, an, astrologer, wrote, schoenberg, a, note, warning, him, that, the, year, was, a, critical, one, 7, 6, 13, this, stunned, and, depressed, the, composer, for, up, to, that, point, he, had, only, been, wary, of, multiples, of, 13, and, never, considered, adding, the, digits, of, his, age, he, died, on, friday, 13, july, 1951, shortly, before, midnight, schoenberg, had, stayed, in, bed, all, day, sick, anxious, and, depressed, his, wife, gertrud, reported, in, a, telegram, to, her, sister, in, law, ottilie, the, next, day, that, arnold, died, at, 11, 45, pm, 15, minutes, before, midnight, in, a, letter, to, ottilie, dated, 4, august, 1951, gertrud, explained, about, a, quarter, to, twelve, i, looked, at, the, clock, and, said, to, myself, another, quarter, of, an, hour, and, then, the, worst, is, over, then, the, doctor, called, me, arnold, s, throat, rattled, twice, his, heart, gave, a, powerful, beat, and, that, was, the, end, schoenberg, s, ashes, were, later, interred, at, the, zentralfriedhof, in, vienna, on, 6, june, 1974, schoenberg, s, significant, compositions, in, the, repertory, of, modern, art, music, extend, over, a, period, of, more, than, 50, years, traditionally, they, are, divided, into, three, periods, though, this, division, is, arguably, arbitrary, as, the, music, in, each, of, these, periods, is, considerably, varied, the, idea, that, his, twelve, tone, period, represents, a, stylistically, unified, body, of, works, is, simply, not, supported, by, the, musical, evidence, and, important, musical, characteristics, especially, those, related, to, motivic, development, transcend, these, boundaries, completely, the, first, of, these, periods, 1894, 1907, is, identified, in, the, legacy, of, the, high, romantic, composers, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, as, well, as, with, expressionist, movements, in, poetry, and, art, the, second, 1908, 1922, is, typified, by, the, abandonment, of, key, centers, a, move, often, described, though, not, by, schoenberg, as, free, atonality, the, third, from, 1923, onward, commences, with, schoenberg, s, invention, of, dodecaphonic, or, twelve, tone, compositional, method, schoenberg, s, best, known, students, hanns, eisler, alban, berg, and, anton, webern, followed, schoenberg, faithfully, through, each, of, these, intellectual, and, aesthetic, transitions, though, not, without, considerable, experimentation, and, variety, of, approach, beginning, with, songs, and, string, quartets, written, around, the, turn, of, the, century, schoenberg, s, concerns, as, a, composer, positioned, him, uniquely, among, his, peers, in, that, his, procedures, exhibited, characteristics, of, both, brahms, and, wagner, who, for, most, contemporary, listeners, were, considered, polar, opposites, representing, mutually, exclusive, directions, in, the, legacy, of, german, music, schoenberg, s, zwei, ges, nge, op, 1, first, performed, in, 1903, set, two, contemporary, poems, to, expressive, music, bordering, the, limits, of, the, lied, genre, schoenberg, s, six, songs, op, 3, 1899, 1903, for, example, exhibit, a, conservative, clarity, of, tonal, organization, typical, of, brahms, and, mahler, reflecting, an, interest, in, balanced, phrases, and, an, undisturbed, hierarchy, of, key, relationships, however, the, songs, also, explore, unusually, bold, incidental, chromaticism, and, seem, to, aspire, to, a, wagnerian, representational, approach, to, motivic, identity, the, synthesis, of, these, approaches, reaches, an, apex, in, his, verkl, rte, nacht, op, 4, 1899, a, programmatic, work, for, string, sextet, that, develops, several, distinctive, leitmotif, like, themes, each, one, eclipsing, and, subordinating, the, last, the, only, motivic, elements, that, persist, throughout, the, work, are, those, that, are, perpetually, dissolved, varied, and, re, combined, in, a, technique, identified, primarily, in, brahms, s, music, that, schoenberg, called, developing, variation, schoenberg, s, procedures, in, the, work, are, organized, in, two, ways, simultaneously, at, once, suggesting, a, wagnerian, narrative, of, motivic, ideas, as, well, as, a, brahmsian, approach, to, motivic, development, and, tonal, cohesion, citing, berg, and, webern, on, schoenberg, s, string, quartet, no, 1, op, 7, 1904, 1905, joseph, n, straus, emphasized, the, importance, of, motivic, coherence, in, the, three, s, uvres, more, generally, every, smallest, turn, of, phrase, even, accompanimental, figuration, is, significant, berg, asserted, parenthetically, praising, schoenberg, s, excess, unheard, of, since, bach, webern, marveled, at, how, schoenberg, creates, an, accompaniment, figure, from, a, motivic, particle, proclaiming, everything, is, thematic, there, is, not, a, single, note, that, does, not, have, a, thematic, basis, the, urgency, of, musical, constructions, lacking, in, tonal, centers, or, traditional, dissonance, consonance, relationships, can, be, traced, as, far, back, as, schoenberg, s, chamber, symphony, no, 1, op, 9, 1906, this, work, is, remarkable, for, its, tonal, development, of, whole, tone, and, quartal, harmony, and, its, initiation, of, dynamic, and, unusual, ensemble, relationships, involving, dramatic, interruption, and, unpredictable, instrumental, allegiances, many, of, these, features, would, typify, the, timbre, oriented, chamber, music, aesthetic, of, the, coming, century, schoenberg, s, music, from, 1908, onward, experiments, in, a, variety, of, ways, with, the, absence, of, traditional, keys, or, tonal, centers, his, first, explicitly, atonal, piece, was, the, second, string, quartet, op, 10, with, soprano, the, last, movement, of, this, piece, has, no, key, signature, marking, schoenberg, s, formal, divorce, from, diatonic, harmonies, other, important, works, of, the, era, include, his, song, cycle, das, buch, der, h, ngenden, g, rten, op, 15, 1908, 1909, his, five, orchestral, pieces, op, 16, 1909, the, influential, pierrot, lunaire, op, 21, 1912, as, well, as, his, dramatic, erwartung, op, 17, 1909, surveying, schoenberg, s, opp, 10, 15, 16, and, 19, webern, argued, it, creates, entirely, new, expressive, values, therefore, it, also, needs, new, means, of, expression, content, and, form, cannot, be, separated, analysts, most, prominently, allen, forte, so, emphasized, motivic, shapes, in, schoenberg, s, and, berg, s, and, webern, s, free, atonal, music, that, benjamin, boretz, and, william, benjamin, suggested, referring, to, it, as, motivic, music, schoenberg, himself, described, his, use, of, a, motivic, unit, varied, and, developed, in, manifold, ways, in, four, orchestral, songs, op, 22, 1913, 1916, writing, that, he, was, in, the, preliminary, stages, of, a, procedure, which, allows, for, a, motif, to, be, a, constant, basis, straus, considered, that, the, designation, motivic, music, might, apply, in, a, modified, way, to, twelve, tone, music, more, generally, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, schoenberg, sought, a, means, of, order, that, would, make, his, musical, texture, simpler, and, clearer, thus, he, arrived, at, his, method, of, composing, with, twelve, tones, which, are, related, only, with, one, another, all, twelve, pitches, of, the, octave, usually, unrealized, compositionally, are, regarded, as, equal, and, no, one, note, or, tonality, is, given, the, emphasis, it, occupied, in, classical, harmony, he, regarded, it, as, the, equivalent, in, music, of, albert, einstein, s, discoveries, in, physics, schoenberg, told, josef, rufer, i, have, made, a, discovery, which, will, ensure, the, supremacy, of, german, music, for, the, next, hundred, years, among, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, works, are, the, variations, for, orchestra, op, 31, 1928, begleitungsmusik, zu, einer, lichtspielscene, op, 34, 1930, piano, pieces, opp, 33a, b, 1931, and, the, piano, concerto, op, 42, 1942, contrary, to, some, reputation, for, doctrinaire, strictness, schoenberg, s, technique, varied, according, to, the, musical, demands, of, each, composition, thus, the, musical, structure, of, his, unfinished, opera, moses, und, aron, is, unlike, that, of, his, phantasy, for, violin, and, piano, op, 47, 1949, ten, features, of, schoenberg, s, mature, twelve, tone, practice, are, generally, characteristic, interdependent, and, interactive, according, to, ethan, haimo, after, some, early, difficulties, schoenberg, began, to, win, public, acceptance, with, works, such, as, the, tone, poem, pelleas, und, melisande, at, a, berlin, performance, in, 1907, at, the, vienna, premi, re, of, the, gurre, lieder, in, 1913, he, received, an, ovation, that, lasted, a, quarter, of, an, hour, and, culminated, with, schoenberg, s, being, presented, with, a, laurel, crown, nonetheless, much, of, his, work, was, not, well, received, his, chamber, symphony, no, 1, premi, red, unremarkably, in, 1907, however, when, it, was, played, again, in, the, skandalkonzert, on, 31, march, 1913, which, also, included, works, by, berg, webern, and, zemlinsky, one, could, hear, the, shrill, sound, of, door, keys, among, the, violent, clapping, and, in, the, second, gallery, the, first, fight, of, the, evening, began, later, in, the, concert, during, a, performance, of, the, altenberg, lieder, by, berg, fighting, broke, out, after, schoenberg, interrupted, the, performance, to, threaten, removal, by, the, police, of, any, troublemakers, according, to, ethan, haimo, understanding, of, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, work, has, been, difficult, to, achieve, owing, in, part, to, the, truly, revolutionary, nature, of, his, new, system, misinformation, disseminated, by, some, early, writers, about, the, system, s, rules, and, exceptions, that, bear, little, relation, to, the, most, significant, features, of, schoenberg, s, music, the, composer, s, secretiveness, and, the, widespread, unavailability, of, his, sketches, and, manuscripts, until, the, late, 1970s, during, his, life, he, was, subjected, to, a, range, of, criticism, and, abuse, that, is, shocking, even, in, hindsight, schoenberg, criticized, igor, stravinsky, s, new, neoclassical, trend, in, the, poem, vielseitigkeit, in, which, he, derogates, neoclassicism, and, obliquely, refers, to, stravinsky, as, der, kleine, modernsky, which, he, used, as, text, for, the, second, of, his, drei, satiren, op, 28, the, third, of, the, drei, satiren, der, neue, klassizismus, also, takes, aim, at, the, neoclassical, trend, in, general, schoenberg, s, serial, technique, of, composition, with, twelve, notes, became, one, of, the, most, central, and, polemical, issues, among, american, and, european, musicians, during, the, mid, to, late, twentieth, century, beginning, in, the, 1940s, and, continuing, to, the, present, day, composers, such, as, pierre, boulez, karlheinz, stockhausen, luigi, nono, and, milton, babbitt, have, extended, schoenberg, s, legacy, in, increasingly, radical, directions, the, major, cities, of, the, united, states, e, g, los, angeles, new, york, and, boston, have, had, historically, significant, performances, of, schoenberg, s, music, with, advocates, such, as, babbitt, in, new, york, and, the, franco, american, conductor, pianist, jacques, louis, monod, schoenberg, s, students, have, been, influential, teachers, at, major, american, universities, leonard, stein, at, usc, ucla, and, calarts, richard, hoffmann, at, oberlin, patricia, carpenter, at, columbia, and, leon, kirchner, and,

professor, of, music, was, also, a, conductor, who, made, a, recording, of, three, master, works, schoenberg, with, the, orchestre, de, la, suisse, romande, released, posthumously, in, late, 2013, this, recording, includes, short, lectures, by, deutsch, on, each, of, the, pieces, in, the, 1920s, ernst, krenek, criticized, a, certain, unnamed, brand, of, contemporary, music, presumably, schoenberg, and, his, disciples, as, the, self, gratification, of, an, individual, who, sits, in, his, studio, and, invents, rules, according, to, which, he, then, writes, down, his, notes, schoenberg, took, offense, at, this, remark, and, answered, that, krenek, wishes, for, only, whores, as, listeners, allen, shawn, has, noted, that, given, schoenberg, s, living, circumstances, his, work, is, usually, defended, rather, than, listened, to, and, that, it, is, difficult, to, experience, it, apart, from, the, ideology, that, surrounds, it, richard, taruskin, asserted, that, schoenberg, committed, what, he, terms, a, poietic, fallacy, the, conviction, that, what, matters, most, or, all, that, matters, in, a, work, of, art, is, the, making, of, it, the, maker, s, input, and, that, the, listener, s, pleasure, must, not, be, the, composer, s, primary, objective, taruskin, also, criticizes, the, ideas, of, measuring, schoenberg, s, value, as, a, composer, in, terms, of, his, influence, on, other, artists, the, overrating, of, technical, innovation, and, the, restriction, of, criticism, to, matters, of, structure, and, craft, while, derogating, other, approaches, as, vulgarian, writing, in, 1977, christopher, small, observed, many, music, lovers, even, today, find, difficulty, with, schoenberg, s, music, small, wrote, his, short, biography, a, quarter, of, a, century, after, the, composer, s, death, according, to, nicholas, cook, writing, some, twenty, years, after, small, schoenberg, had, thought, that, this, lack, of, comprehension, was, merely, a, transient, if, unavoidable, phase, the, history, of, music, they, said, showed, that, audiences, always, resisted, the, unfamiliar, but, in, time, they, got, used, to, it, and, learned, to, appreciate, it, schoenberg, himself, looked, forward, to, a, time, when, as, he, said, grocers, boys, would, whistle, serial, music, in, their, rounds, if, schoenberg, really, believed, what, he, said, and, it, is, hard, to, be, quite, sure, about, this, then, it, represents, one, of, the, most, poignant, moments, in, the, history, of, music, for, serialism, did, not, achieve, popularity, the, process, of, familiarization, for, which, he, and, his, contemporaries, were, waiting, never, occurred, ben, earle, 2003, found, that, schoenberg, while, revered, by, experts, and, taught, to, generations, of, students, on, degree, courses, remained, unloved, by, the, public, despite, more, than, forty, years, of, advocacy, and, the, production, of, books, devoted, to, the, explanation, of, this, difficult, repertory, to, non, specialist, audiences, it, would, seem, that, in, particular, british, attempts, to, popularize, music, of, this, kind, can, now, safely, be, said, to, have, failed, in, his, 2018, biography, of, schoenberg, s, near, contemporary, and, similarly, pioneering, composer, debussy, stephen, walsh, takes, issue, with, the, idea, that, it, is, not, possible, for, a, creative, artist, to, be, both, radical, and, popular, walsh, concludes, schoenberg, may, be, the, first, great, composer, in, modern, history, whose, music, has, not, entered, the, repertoire, almost, a, century, and, a, half, after, his, birth, adrian, leverk, hn, the, protagonist, of, thomas, mann, s, novel, doctor, faustus, 1947, is, a, composer, whose, use, of, twelve, tone, technique, parallels, the, innovations, of, arnold, schoenberg, leverk, hn, who, may, be, based, on, nietzsche, sells, his, soul, to, the, devil, and, is, rewarded, with, superhuman, talent, schoenberg, was, unhappy, about, this, and, initiated, an, exchange, of, letters, with, mann, following, the, novel, s, publication, writer, sean, o, brien, comments, that, written, in, the, shadow, of, hitler, doktor, faustus, observes, the, rise, of, nazism, but, its, relationship, to, political, history, is, oblique, thomas, mann, was, always, primarily, interested, in, classical, music, which, also, plays, a, role, in, many, of, his, works, he, sought, advice, from, theodor, w, adorno, on, the, technical, compositional, details, of, schoenberg, s, new, music, who, revised, the, chapters, accordingly, schoenberg, was, a, painter, of, considerable, ability, whose, works, were, considered, good, enough, to, exhibit, alongside, those, of, franz, marc, and, wassily, kandinsky, as, fellow, members, of, the, expressionist, group, der, blaue, reiter, from, about, 1908, to, 1910, he, would, execute, approximately, two, thirds, of, a, total, oeuvre, comprising, about, sixty, five, oils, he, was, interested, in, hopalong, cassidy, films, which, paul, buhle, and, david, wagner, 2002, v, vii, attribute, to, the, films, left, wing, screenwriters, a, rather, odd, claim, in, light, of, schoenberg, s, statement, that, he, was, a, bourgeois, turned, monarchist
