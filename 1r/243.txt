saadi, sh, r, z, better, known, by, his, pen, name, saadi, s, d, i, persian, romanized, sa, d, ipa, also, known, as, sadi, of, shiraz, sa, d, sh, r, z, born, 1210, died, 1291, or, 1292, was, a, persian, poet, and, prose, writer, of, the, medieval, period, he, is, recognized, for, the, quality, of, his, writings, and, for, the, depth, of, his, social, and, moral, thoughts, saadi, is, widely, recognized, as, one, of, the, greatest, poets, of, the, classical, literary, tradition, earning, him, the, nickname, the, master, of, speech, or, the, wordsmith, ost, d, e, soxan, or, simply, master, ost, d, among, persian, scholars, he, has, been, quoted, in, the, western, traditions, as, well, his, book, bustan, has, been, ranked, as, one, of, the, 100, greatest, books, of, all, time, by, the, guardian, saadi, shirazi, s, birth, date, is, uncertain, most, scholars, consider, him, to, have, been, born, in, 1209, or, 1210, he, was, from, the, city, of, shiraz, the, provincial, capital, of, the, fars, province, since, 1148, the, province, had, been, under, the, rule, of, the, salghurids, a, persianate, dynasty, of, turkoman, origin, there, is, little, certainty, concerning, saadi, s, life, although, his, own, writings, particularly, the, bustan, and, gulistan, contain, many, supposedly, autobiographical, memories, many, of, these, are, historically, unlikely, and, are, likely, made, up, or, cast, in, the, first, person, for, rhetorical, effect, even, the, earliest, references, to, him, in, external, literature, differ, in, crucial, details, even, his, real, name, is, uncertain, in, sources, his, entire, name, which, consists, of, his, given, name, honorific, laqab, agnomen, kunya, and, patronymic, is, spelled, in, several, differing, ways, the, oldest, known, source, to, mention, his, full, name, is, the, tal, i, al, majma, al, d, b, fi, mo, jam, al, alq, b, summary, of, the, gathering, of, refinements, concerning, the, lexicon, of, honorifics, by, ibn, al, fuwati, died, 1323, in, a, letter, dated, 1262, he, asked, saadi, for, samples, of, his, arabic, poetry, and, mentioned, his, full, name, as, muslih, al, din, abu, muhammad, abd, allah, ibn, musharrif, the, iranian, scholar, saeed, nafisi, favoured, this, version, of, his, full, name, however, the, majority, of, other, academics, favour, the, information, found, in, the, early, manuscripts, of, saadi, s, writings, for, instance, the, british, iranologist, edward, granville, browne, used, a, text, from, 1328, to, argue, that, saadi, s, full, name, was, musharrif, al, din, ibn, muslih, al, din, abd, allah, the, majority, of, subsequent, western, academics, including, arthur, john, arberry, jan, rypka, and, r, davis, include, abd, allah, in, saadi, s, patronymic, hence, abu, abd, allah, musharrif, al, din, muslih, the, iranian, scholar, zabihollah, safa, came, to, the, conclusion, that, muslih, was, saadi, s, given, name, and, gives, his, full, name, as, abu, muhammad, musharrif, al, din, muslih, ibn, abd, allah, ibn, musharrif, based, on, the, preface, to, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, compilations, of, saadi, s, collected, works, which, was, created, by, his, fellow, townsman, ali, ibn, ahmad, ibn, abu, bakr, bisotun, in, 1326, in, his, book, nafahat, al, uns, the, persian, poet, jami, died, 1492, provides, virtually, the, same, version, of, the, name, this, version, is, also, supported, by, the, iranologist, paul, e, losensky, his, pen, name, saadi, is, unambiguous, as, it, appears, frequently, in, his, work, and, acts, as, his, signature, in, all, of, his, ghazals, amatory, poem, or, ode, however, there, are, doubts, over, where, it, came, from, since, two, members, of, the, salghurid, dynasty, named, sa, d, ruled, for, most, of, saadi, s, life, it, is, likely, that, the, inspiration, for, the, name, came, from, his, allegiance, to, them, the, iranian, scholar, abdolhossein, zarrinkoob, argues, that, sa, d, or, banu, sa, d, was, also, the, name, of, the, dynasty, itself, hence, saadi, s, adoption, of, the, name, which, demonstrated, his, loyalty, to, them, saadi, appears, to, have, received, his, early, education, from, his, father, who, also, instilled, in, him, lifelong, tolerance, values, during, saadi, s, adolescence, his, father, died, thus, leaving, him, an, orphan, probably, around, 1223, 24, when, sa, d, i, was, briefly, deposed, by, ghiyath, al, din, pirshah, saadi, still, a, teenager, left, for, baghdad, to, continue, his, education, there, ibn, al, jawzi, a, hanbalite, scholar, was, one, of, saadi, s, teachers, while, he, was, a, fellowship, student, at, the, nizamiyyah, school, in, baghdad, the, iranian, scholar, badiozzaman, forouzanfar, has, found, notable, parallels, between, saadi, s, teachings, and, those, of, sufi, master, shihab, al, din, yahya, ibn, habash, suhrawardi, suggesting, that, they, were, possibly, associated, after, completing, his, studies, saadi, spent, a, considerable, amount, of, time, traveling, across, the, islamic, world, according, to, first, hand, reports, he, killed, a, temple, priest, in, india, and, was, captured, by, the, crusaders, in, syria, according, to, losensky, despite, efforts, of, scholars, such, as, h, mass, and, j, a, boyle, the, effort, to, re, create, an, exact, itinerary, of, his, travels, from, his, works, is, misguided, the, iranologist, homa, katouzian, examined, the, data, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, while, saadi, was, probably, in, iraq, syria, palestine, and, the, arabian, peninsula, it, was, unlikely, that, he, ever, made, it, as, far, east, as, khorasan, india, or, kashgar, after, nearly, 30, years, of, travel, saadi, returned, to, shiraz, in, 1257, and, it, appears, that, he, was, already, well, known, and, well, respected, as, a, poet, this, reputation, must, have, come, from, the, widespread, publication, of, his, ghazals, he, was, keen, to, restore, his, connections, to, the, salghurid, dynasty, as, evidenced, by, the, speed, with, which, the, bustan, and, gulistan, were, published, and, their, dedications, in, a, short, ode, saadi, says, he, was, inspired, to, go, back, to, shiraz, by, the, establishment, of, peace, and, prosperity, established, by, the, salghurid, ruler, abu, bakr, ibn, sa, d, r, 1226, 1260, however, the, salghurid, kingdom, did, not, last, long, after, saadi, came, back, in, 1256, 57, abu, bakr, acknowledged, the, mongol, empire, as, his, suzerain, abu, bakr, died, in, 1260, and, was, succeeded, by, his, eldest, son, sa, d, ii, who, died, 12, days, later, their, death, is, the, subject, of, various, elegies, by, saadi, the, ruler, after, this, was, sa, d, ii, s, 12, year, old, son, muhammad, i, ibn, sa, d, who, ruled, under, the, supervision, of, his, mother, tarkhan, khatun, saadi, praises, both, of, them, in, his, poems, the, salghurid, dynasty, crumbled, apart, fast, due, to, progressively, escalating, pressure, by, the, mongol, empire, following, muhammad, i, s, death, two, of, abu, bakr, s, nephews, were, installed, on, the, salghurid, throne, saadi, composed, three, poems, honoring, the, second, of, them, saljuk, shah, ibn, salghur, during, his, brief, five, month, reign, in, 1263, following, an, impulsive, and, alcohol, influenced, uprising, by, saljuk, shah, ibn, salghur, the, mongols, killed, him, formally, handing, over, power, to, abish, khatun, sa, d, ii, s, youngest, daughter, however, shiraz, was, effectively, incorporated, under, mongol, rule, through, her, forced, marriage, to, m, ngke, tem, r, the, son, of, the, ruler, of, the, mongol, ilkhanate, hulagu, khan, r, 1256, 1265, one, of, saadis, poems, was, most, likely, dedicated, to, abish, khatun, saadi, did, not, seem, to, have, supported, the, rise, of, the, mongol, empire, he, composed, two, qasidas, odes, one, in, arabic, and, the, other, in, persian, which, grieved, over, the, collapse, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, death, of, the, last, caliph, al, musta, sim, r, 1242, 1258, in, 1258, during, the, mongol, attack, on, baghdad, in, spite, of, this, saadi, composed, a, poem, in, honor, of, the, transition, of, authority, from, the, salghurids, to, the, mongols, and, his, writings, include, a, number, of, poems, with, similar, dedications, to, both, the, mongol, rulers, and, their, persian, administrators, amir, ankyanu, one, of, the, most, prominent, of, these, was, the, governor, of, shiraz, from, 1268, to, 1272, saadi, wrote, four, qasidas, and, the, prose, treatise, dar, tarbiat, e, yaki, az, moluk, to, him, according, to, losensky, none, of, these, works, can, be, considered, panegyrics, in, the, usual, sense, of, the, word, since, they, consist, mostly, of, counsel, and, warnings, concerning, the, proper, conduct, of, rulers, the, poems, saadi, wrote, to, shams, al, din, husayn, alakani, the, longtime, chief, of, the, chancery, in, shiraz, are, less, cautionary, in, tone, shams, al, din, juvayni, the, principal, finance, minister, of, the, ilkhanate, had, assigned, him, to, this, position, along, with, his, brother, ata, malik, juvayni, the, author, of, tarikh, i, jahangushay, shams, al, din, juvayni, is, honored, in, some, of, the, most, prominent, ghazals, by, saadi, saadi, s, encounter, with, the, two, juvayni, brothers, and, the, ilkhanate, ruler, abaqa, r, 1265, 1282, at, tabriz, which, took, place, on, his, way, back, from, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, is, the, subject, of, two, treatises, that, are, frequently, found, in, his, collected, works, although, they, were, not, written, by, him, a, collection, of, qit, a, monorhyme, poetry, poems, named, the, sahebiya, in, honor, of, shams, al, din, juvayni, is, also, present, in, a, few, of, saadi, s, earlier, writings, a, brief, qasida, to, majd, al, din, rumi, who, worked, as, an, administrative, officer, in, shiraz, under, the, ilkhanate, ruler, arghun, r, 1284, 1291, between, 1287, and, 1289, is, seemingly, the, last, dateable, poetry, by, saadi, a, few, years, later, saadi, died, in, shiraz, 1291, 1299, are, the, dates, of, death, given, by, early, sources, nafisi, came, to, the, conclusion, that, saadi, died, on, 9, december, 1292, after, carefully, examining, the, available, data, safa, drawing, from, the, tarikh, i, guzida, written, in, 1330, by, hamdallah, mustawfi, which, is, the, earliest, surviving, reliable, narrative, as, well, as, other, sources, from, the, 14th, century, concludes, that, saadi, died, a, year, earlier, between, 25, november, and, 22, december, 1291, the, benefit, of, this, earlier, date, is, that, it, helps, explain, why, chronicles, differ, on, the, death, date, of, saadi, because, saadi, died, in, the, last, month, of, the, year, commemorative, chronicles, may, had, honored, the, year, of, his, death, or, the, year, after, at, the, end, of, the, 40, day, mourning, period, losensky, therefore, puts, his, death, date, as, either, 1291, or, 1292, the, german, cartographer, and, explorer, carsten, niebuhr, visited, the, tomb, of, saadi, in, 1765, writing, that, this, building, is, very, dilapidated, and, will, likely, collapse, unless, some, rich, mohammedan, takes, pity, on, it, and, has, it, repaired, a, few, years, later, the, zand, ruler, karim, khan, zand, r, 1751, 1779, ordered, renovations, to, the, tomb, he, had, an, iron, railing, created, around, the, gravestone, and, a, brick, and, plaster, structure, created, over, the, grave, sa, di, s, best, known, works, are, bustan, the, orchard, completed, in, 1257, and, gulistan, the, rose, garden, completed, in, 1258, bustan, is, entirely, in, verse, epic, metre, it, consists, of, stories, aptly, illustrating, the, standard, virtues, recommended, to, muslims, justice, liberality, modesty, contentment, and, reflections, on, the, behavior, of, dervishes, and, their, ecstatic, practices, gulistan, is, mainly, in, prose, and, contains, stories, and, personal, anecdotes, the, text, is, interspersed, with, a, variety, of, short, poems, which, contain, aphorisms, advice, and, humorous, reflections, demonstrating, saadi, s, profound, awareness, of, the, absurdity, of, human, existence, the, fate, of, those, who, depend, on, the, changeable, moods, of, kings, is, contrasted, with, the, freedom, of, the, dervishes, regarding, the, importance, of, professions, saadi, writes, saadi, is, also, remembered, as, a, panegyrist, and, lyricist, the, author, of, a, number, of, odes, portraying, human, experience, and, also, of, particular, odes, such, as, the, lament, on, the, fall, of, baghdad, after, the, mongol, invasion, in, 1258, his, lyrics, are, found, in, ghazaliyat, lyrics, and, his, odes, in, qasa, id, odes, he, is, also, known, for, a, number, of, works, in, arabic, in, the, bustan, saadi, writes, of, a, man, who, relates, his, time, in, battle, with, the, mongols, in, isfahan, i, had, a, friend, who, was, warlike, spirited, and, shrewd, after, long, i, met, him, o, tiger, seizer, i, exclaimed, what, has, made, thee, decrepit, like, an, old, fox, he, laughed, and, said, since, the, days, of, war, against, the, mongols, i, have, expelled, the, thoughts, of, fighting, from, my, head, then, did, i, see, the, earth, arrayed, with, spears, like, a, forest, of, reeds, i, raised, like, smoke, the, dust, of, conflict, but, when, fortune, does, not, favour, of, what, avail, is, fury, i, am, one, who, in, combat, could, take, with, a, spear, a, ring, from, the, palm, of, the, hand, but, as, my, star, did, not, befriend, me, they, encircled, me, as, with, a, ring, i, seized, the, opportunity, of, flight, for, only, a, fool, strives, with, fate, how, could, my, helmet, and, cuirass, aid, me, when, my, bright, star, favoured, me, not, when, the, key, of, victory, is, not, in, the, hand, no, one, can, break, open, the, door, of, conquest, with, his, arms, the, enemy, were, a, pack, of, leopards, and, as, strong, as, elephants, the, heads, of, the, heroes, were, encased, in, iron, as, were, also, the, hoofs, of, the, horses, we, urged, on, our, arab, steeds, like, a, cloud, and, when, the, two, armies, encountered, each, other, thou, wouldst, have, said, they, had, struck, the, sky, down, to, the, earth, from, the, raining, of, arrows, that, descended, like, hail, the, storm, of, death, arose, in, every, corner, not, one, of, our, troops, came, out, of, the, battle, but, his, cuirass, was, soaked, with, blood, not, that, our, swords, were, blunt, it, was, the, vengeance, of, stars, of, ill, fortune, overpowered, we, surrendered, like, a, fish, which, though, protected, by, scales, is, caught, by, the, hook, in, the, bait, since, fortune, averted, her, face, useless, was, our, shield, against, the, arrows, of, fate, in, addition, to, the, bustan, and, gulistan, saadi, also, wrote, four, books, of, love, poems, ghazals, and, number, of, longer, mono, rhyme, poems, qasidas, in, both,

for, breaking, down, all, barriers, between, human, beings, the, original, persian, text, is, as, follows, the, literal, translation, of, the, above, is, as, follows, the, children, of, adam, are,

distinguished, between, the, spiritual, and, the, practical, or, mundane, aspects, of, life, in, his, bustan, for, example, spiritual, saadi, uses, the, mundane, world, as, a, spring, board, to, propel, himself, beyond, the, earthly, realms, the, images, in, bustan, are, delicate, in, nature, and, soothing, in, the, gulistan, on, the, other, hand, mundane, saadi, lowers, the, spiritual, to,

saadi, is, that, he, embodies, both, the, sufi, sheikh, and, the, travelling, merchant, they, are, as, he, himself, puts, it, two, almond, kernels, in, the, same, shell, saadi, s, prose, style, described, as, simple, but, impossible, to, imitate, flows, quite, naturally, and, effortlessly, its, simplicity, however, is, grounded, in, a, semantic, web, consisting, of, synonymy, homophony, and,

followed, also, a, turn, toward, the, didactic, where, with, a, rich, experience, of, life, the, far, traveled, saadi, was, master, before, it, submerged, itself, in, the, depths, of, the,
