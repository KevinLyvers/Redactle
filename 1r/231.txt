the, reconfiguration, of, borders, the, emergence, of, the, persianate, world, with, empires, such, as, safavid, uzbek, ottoman, and, mughal, his, works, were, disseminated, as, far, as, to, regions, such, as, the, deccan, the, term, persianate, world, a, relatively, contemporary, expression, would, indicate, regions, such, as, afghanistan, iran, and, a, few, regions, in, central, asia, however, contemporary, scholars, perceive, the, usage, of, this, word, in, a, more, transnational, fashion, i, e, also, take, into, account, all, the, regions, wherein, persian, as, a, language, culture, and, tradition, flourished, and, developed, for, instance, the, indian, subcontinent, is, one, such, region, where, persian, ever, since, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, evolved, and, played, a, significant, role, not, only, was, persian, the, court, language, of, the, mughal, empire, but, it, was, also, the, language, of, official, discourses, led, by, intellectuals, and, civil, society, although, the, native, persian, speakers, of, iran, always, distinguished, themselves, from, their, counterparts, in, south, asia, the, former, considered, themselves, as, superior, to, the, latter, despite, the, politics, of, language, and, geo, cultural, identity, jami, was, well, recognised, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, his, lifetime, prior, to, the, consolidation, of, the, mughal, empire, this, was, because, of, mahmud, gavan, imad, al, din, d, 886, 1481, a, gilani, migrant, who, was, in, service, of, the, bahman, shahs, of, the, deccan, gavan, invited, jami, to, migrate, to, india, but, the, latter, politely, refused, citing, the, health, issues, of, his, mother, however, when, one, acquaintance, was, tempted, to, migrate, jami, asserted, to, not, quit, the, khorasanian, homeland, for, the, black, land, of, india, through, both, these, instances, one, can, see, jami, s, strong, affinity, with, the, persianate, land, in, the, context, of, the, indian, subcontinent, jami, s, legacy, and, influence, in, the, post, timurid, period, can, significantly, be, perceived, in, various, instances, the, first, mughal, emperor, zahir, al, din, babur, in, his, memoir, baburnama, referred, to, jami, as, the, foremost, authority, of, the, age, in, all, of, the, sciences, and, as, a, poet, of, such, renown, that, the, mere, mention, of, his, name, is, a, source, of, blessing, according, to, british, american, professor, of, persian, studies, hamid, algar, it, was, not, jami, s, ghazals, or, qasidas, but, masnavis, such, as, yusuf, and, zulaykha, that, were, thought, of, so, eminent, insofar, subsequent, mughal, emperors, post, babur, like, humayun, akbar, jahangir, shahjahan, produced, their, own, versions, of, the, narrative, as, late, as, the, nineteenth, century, jami, s, influence, on, the, persianized, urdu, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, many, urdu, poets, such, as, ghalib, has, also, been, well, documented, in, south, asia, for, instance, one, of, ghalib, s, contemporary, biographers, mehr, afshan, farooqi, while, discussing, the, so, called, indian, style, or, mughal, safavid, style, in, the, context, of, the, history, of, persian, poetry, traces, the, persian, influence, on, urdu, to, baba, fighani, a, pupil, of, jami
