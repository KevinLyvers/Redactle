karl, pearson, frs, frse, p, r, s, n, born, carl, pearson, 27, march, 1857, 27, april, 1936, was, an, english, biostatistician, eugenicist, and, mathematician, he, has, been, credited, with, establishing, the, discipline, of, mathematical, statistics, he, founded, the, world, s, first, university, statistics, department, at, university, college, london, in, 1911, and, contributed, significantly, to, the, field, of, biometrics, and, meteorology, pearson, was, also, a, proponent, of, social, darwinism, and, eugenics, and, his, thought, is, an, example, of, what, is, today, described, as, scientific, racism, pearson, was, a, prot, g, and, biographer, of, sir, francis, galton, he, edited, and, completed, both, william, kingdon, clifford, s, common, sense, of, the, exact, sciences, 1885, and, isaac, todhunter, s, history, of, the, theory, of, elasticity, vol, 1, 1886, 1893, and, vol, 2, 1893, following, their, deaths, pearson, was, born, in, islington, london, into, a, quaker, family, his, father, was, william, pearson, qc, of, the, inner, temple, and, his, mother, fanny, n, e, smith, and, he, had, two, siblings, arthur, and, amy, pearson, attended, university, college, school, followed, by, king, s, college, cambridge, in, 1876, to, study, mathematics, graduating, in, 1879, as, third, wrangler, in, the, mathematical, tripos, he, then, travelled, to, germany, to, study, physics, at, the, university, of, heidelberg, under, g, h, quincke, and, metaphysics, under, kuno, fischer, he, next, visited, the, university, of, berlin, where, he, attended, the, lectures, of, the, physiologist, emil, du, bois, reymond, on, darwinism, emil, was, a, brother, of, paul, du, bois, reymond, the, mathematician, pearson, also, studied, roman, law, taught, by, bruns, and, mommsen, medieval, and, 16th, century, german, literature, and, socialism, he, became, an, accomplished, historian, and, germanist, and, spent, much, of, the, 1880s, in, berlin, heidelberg, vienna, saig, bei, lenzkirch, and, brixlegg, he, wrote, on, passion, plays, religion, goethe, werther, as, well, as, sex, related, themes, and, was, a, founder, of, the, men, and, women, s, club, pearson, was, offered, a, germanics, post, at, king, s, college, cambridge, comparing, cambridge, students, to, those, he, knew, from, germany, karl, found, german, students, inathletic, and, weak, he, wrote, to, his, mother, i, used, to, think, athletics, and, sport, was, overestimated, at, cambridge, but, now, i, think, it, cannot, be, too, highly, valued, on, returning, to, england, in, 1880, pearson, first, went, to, cambridge, back, in, cambridge, i, worked, in, the, engineering, shops, but, drew, up, the, schedule, in, mittel, and, althochdeutsch, for, the, medieval, languages, tripos, in, his, first, book, the, new, werther, pearson, gives, a, clear, indication, of, why, he, studied, so, many, diverse, subjects, i, rush, from, science, to, philosophy, and, from, philosophy, to, our, old, friends, the, poets, and, then, over, wearied, by, too, much, idealism, i, fancy, i, become, practical, in, returning, to, science, have, you, ever, attempted, to, conceive, all, there, is, in, the, world, worth, knowing, that, not, one, subject, in, the, universe, is, unworthy, of, study, the, giants, of, literature, the, mysteries, of, many, dimensional, space, the, attempts, of, boltzmann, and, crookes, to, penetrate, nature, s, very, laboratory, the, kantian, theory, of, the, universe, and, the, latest, discoveries, in, embryology, with, their, wonderful, tales, of, the, development, of, life, what, an, immensity, beyond, our, grasp, mankind, seems, on, the, verge, of, a, new, and, glorious, discovery, what, newton, did, to, simplify, the, planetary, motions, must, now, be, done, to, unite, in, one, whole, the, various, isolated, theories, of, mathematical, physics, pearson, then, returned, to, london, to, study, law, emulating, his, father, quoting, pearson, s, own, account, coming, to, london, i, read, in, chambers, in, lincoln, s, inn, drew, up, bills, of, sale, and, was, called, to, the, bar, but, varied, legal, studies, by, lecturing, on, heat, at, barnes, on, martin, luther, at, hampstead, and, on, lassalle, and, marx, on, sundays, at, revolutionary, clubs, around, soho, his, next, career, move, was, to, the, inner, temple, where, he, read, law, until, 1881, although, he, never, practised, after, this, he, returned, to, mathematics, deputising, for, the, mathematics, professor, at, king, s, college, london, in, 1881, and, for, the, professor, at, university, college, london, in, 1883, in, 1884, he, was, appointed, to, the, goldsmid, chair, of, applied, mathematics, and, mechanics, at, university, college, london, pearson, became, the, editor, of, common, sense, of, the, exact, sciences, 1885, when, william, kingdon, clifford, died, 1891, saw, him, also, appointed, to, the, professorship, of, geometry, at, gresham, college, here, he, met, walter, frank, raphael, weldon, a, zoologist, who, had, some, interesting, problems, requiring, quantitative, solutions, the, collaboration, in, biometry, and, evolutionary, theory, was, a, fruitful, one, and, lasted, until, weldon, died, in, 1906, weldon, introduced, pearson, to, charles, darwin, s, cousin, francis, galton, who, was, interested, in, aspects, of, evolution, such, as, heredity, and, eugenics, pearson, became, galton, s, prot, g, at, times, to, the, verge, of, hero, worship, after, galton, s, death, in, 1911, pearson, embarked, on, producing, his, definitive, biography, a, three, volume, tome, of, narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and, photographs, published, in, 1914, 1924, and, 1930, with, much, of, pearson, s, own, money, paying, for, their, print, runs, the, biography, done, to, satisfy, myself, and, without, regard, to, traditional, standards, to, the, needs, of, publishers, or, to, the, tastes, of, the, reading, public, triumphed, galton, s, life, work, and, personal, heredity, he, predicted, that, galton, rather, than, charles, darwin, would, be, remembered, as, the, most, prodigious, grandson, of, erasmus, darwin, when, galton, died, he, left, the, residue, of, his, estate, to, the, university, of, london, for, a, chair, in, eugenics, pearson, was, the, first, holder, of, this, chair, the, galton, chair, of, eugenics, later, the, galton, chair, of, genetics, in, accordance, with, galton, s, wishes, pearson, formed, the, department, of, applied, statistics, with, financial, support, from, the, drapers, company, which, combined, the, biometric, and, galton, laboratories, he, remained, with, the, department, until, his, retirement, in, 1933, and, continued, to, work, until, his, death, in, 1890, pearson, married, maria, sharpe, the, couple, had, three, children, sigrid, loetitia, pearson, helga, sharpe, pearson, and, egon, pearson, who, became, a, statistician, himself, and, succeeded, his, father, as, head, of, the, applied, statistics, department, at, university, college, maria, died, in, 1928, and, in, 1929, karl, married, margaret, victoria, child, a, co, worker, at, the, biometric, laboratory, he, and, his, family, lived, at, 7, well, road, in, hampstead, now, marked, with, a, blue, plaque, he, died, at, coldharbour, surrey, on, 27, april, 1936, when, the, 23, year, old, albert, einstein, started, the, olympia, academy, study, group, in, 1902, with, his, two, younger, friends, maurice, solovine, and, conrad, habicht, his, first, reading, suggestion, was, pearson, s, the, grammar, of, science, this, book, covered, several, themes, that, were, later, to, become, part, of, the, theories, of, einstein, and, other, scientists, pearson, asserted, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, relative, to, the, perceptive, ability, of, the, observer, irreversibility, of, natural, processes, he, argued, is, a, purely, relative, conception, an, observer, who, travels, at, the, exact, velocity, of, light, would, see, an, eternal, now, or, an, absence, of, motion, he, speculated, that, an, observer, who, travelled, faster, than, light, would, see, time, reversal, similar, to, a, cinema, film, being, run, backwards, pearson, also, discussed, antimatter, the, fourth, dimension, and, wrinkles, in, time, pearson, s, relativity, was, based, on, idealism, in, the, sense, of, ideas, or, pictures, in, a, mind, there, are, many, signs, he, wrote, that, a, sound, idealism, is, surely, replacing, as, a, basis, for, natural, philosophy, the, crude, materialism, of, the, older, physicists, preface, to, second, ed, the, grammar, of, science, further, he, stated, science, is, in, reality, a, classification, and, analysis, of, the, contents, of, the, mind, in, truth, the, field, of, science, is, much, more, consciousness, than, an, external, world, ibid, ch, ii, 6, law, in, the, scientific, sense, is, thus, essentially, a, product, of, the, human, mind, and, has, no, meaning, apart, from, man, ibid, ch, iii, 4, pearson, was, a, zealous, atheist, and, a, freethinker, pearson, was, known, in, his, lifetime, as, a, prominent, freethinker, and, socialist, he, gave, lectures, on, such, issues, as, the, woman, s, question, this, was, the, era, of, the, suffragist, movement, in, the, uk, and, upon, karl, marx, his, commitment, to, socialism, and, its, ideals, led, him, to, refuse, the, offer, of, being, created, an, obe, officer, of, the, order, of, the, british, empire, in, 1920, and, also, to, refuse, a, knighthood, in, 1935, a, eugenicist, who, applied, social, darwinism, to, entire, nations, pearson, saw, war, against, inferior, races, as, a, logical, implication, of, the, theory, of, evolution, my, view, and, i, think, it, may, be, called, the, scientific, view, of, a, nation, he, wrote, is, that, of, an, organized, whole, kept, up, to, a, high, pitch, of, internal, efficiency, by, insuring, that, its, numbers, are, substantially, recruited, from, the, better, stocks, and, kept, up, to, a, high, pitch, of, external, efficiency, by, contest, chiefly, by, way, of, war, with, inferior, races, he, reasoned, that, if, august, weismann, s, theory, of, germ, plasm, is, correct, the, nation, is, wasting, money, when, it, tries, to, improve, people, who, come, from, poor, stock, weismann, argued, that, acquired, characteristics, could, not, be, inherited, therefore, training, benefits, only, the, trained, generation, their, children, will, not, exhibit, the, learned, improvements, and, in, turn, will, need, to, be, improved, no, degenerate, and, feeble, stock, will, ever, be, converted, into, healthy, and, sound, stock, by, the, accumulated, effects, of, education, good, laws, and, sanitary, surroundings, such, means, may, render, the, individual, members, of, a, stock, passable, if, not, strong, members, of, society, but, the, same, process, will, have, to, be, gone, through, again, and, again, with, their, offspring, and, this, in, ever, widening, circles, if, the, stock, owing, to, the, conditions, in, which, society, has, placed, it, is, able, to, increase, its, numbers, history, shows, me, one, way, and, one, way, only, in, which, a, high, state, of, civilization, has, been, produced, namely, the, struggle, of, race, with, race, and, the, survival, of, the, physically, and, mentally, fitter, race, if, you, want, to, know, whether, the, lower, races, of, man, can, evolve, a, higher, type, i, fear, the, only, course, is, to, leave, them, to, fight, it, out, among, themselves, and, even, then, the, struggle, for, existence, between, individual, and, individual, between, tribe, and, tribe, may, not, be, supported, by, that, physical, selection, due, to, a, particular, climate, on, which, probably, so, much, of, the, aryan, s, success, depended, in, the, myth, of, the, jewish, race, raphael, and, jennifer, patai, cite, karl, pearson, s, 1925, opposition, in, the, first, issue, of, the, journal, annals, of, eugenics, which, he, founded, to, jewish, immigration, into, britain, pearson, alleged, that, these, immigrants, will, develop, into, a, parasitic, race, taken, on, the, average, and, regarding, both, sexes, this, alien, jewish, population, is, somewhat, inferior, physically, and, mentally, to, the, native, population, pearson, concluding, remarks, on, stepping, down, as, editor, of, the, annals, of, eugenics, indicate, a, sense, of, failure, of, his, aim, to, use, the, scientific, study, of, eugenics, as, a, guide, for, moral, conduct, and, public, policy, my, endeavour, during, the, twenty, two, years, in, which, i, have, held, the, post, of, galton, professor, has, been, to, prove, in, the, first, place, that, eugenics, can, be, developed, as, an, academic, study, and, in, the, second, place, to, make, the, conclusions, drawn, from, that, study, a, ground, for, social, propagandism, only, when, there, are, sound, scientific, reasons, upon, which, to, base, our, judgments, and, as, a, result, our, opinions, as, to, moral, conduct, even, at, the, present, day, there, are, far, too, many, general, impressions, drawn, from, limited, or, too, often, wrongly, interpreted, experience, and, far, too, many, inadequately, demonstrated, and, too, lightly, accepted, theories, for, any, nation, to, proceed, hastily, with, unlimited, eugenic, legislation, this, statement, however, must, never, be, taken, as, an, excuse, for, indefinitely, suspending, all, eugenic, teaching, and, every, form, of, communal, action, in, matters, of, sex, nonetheless, in, june, 2020, ucl, announced, that, it, was, renaming, two, buildings, which, had, been, named, after, pearson, because, of, his, connection, with, eugenics, karl, pearson, was, important, in, the, founding, of, the, school, of, biometrics, which, was, one, of, several, competing, theories, to, describe, evolution, and, population, inheritance, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, his, series, of, eighteen, papers, mathematical, contributions, to, the, theory, of, evolution, established, him, as, the, founder, of, the, biometrical, school, for, inheritance, in, fact, pearson, devoted, much, time, during, 1893, to, 1904, to, developing, statistical, techniques, for, biometry, these, techniques, which, are, widely, used, today, for, statistical, analysis, include, the, chi, squared, test, standard, deviation, and, correlation, and, regression, coefficients, pearson, s, law, of, ancestral, heredity, stated, that, germ, plasm, consisted, of, heritable, elements, inherited, from, the, parents, as, well, as, from, more, distant, ancestors, the, proportion, of, which, varied, for, different, traits, karl, pearson, was, a, follower, of, galton, and, although, the, two, differed, in, some, respects, pearson, used, a, substantial, amount, of, francis, galton, s, statistical, concepts, in, his, formulation, of, the, biometrical, school, for, inheritance, such, as, the, law, of, regression, the, biometric, school, unlike, the, mendelians, focused, not, on, providing, a, mechanism, for, inheritance, but, rather, on, providing, a, mathematical, description, for, inheritance, that, was, not, causal, in, nature, while, galton, proposed, a, discontinuous, theory, of, evolution, in, which, species, would, have, to, change, via, large, jumps, rather, than, small, changes, that, built, up, over, time, pearson, pointed, out, flaws, in, galton, s, argument, and, actually, used, galton, s, ideas, to, further, a, continuous, theory, of, evolution, whereas, the, mendelians, favored, a, discontinuous, theory, of, evolution, while, galton, focused, primarily, on, the, application, of, statistical, methods, to, the, study, of, heredity, pearson, and, his, colleague, weldon, expanded, statistical, reasoning, to, the, fields, of, inheritance, variation, correlation, and, natural, and, sexual, selection, for, pearson, the, theory, of, evolution, was, not, intended, to, identify, a, biological, mechanism, that, explained, patterns, of, inheritance, whereas, mendelian, s, theory, postulated, the, gene, as, the, mechanism, for, inheritance, pearson, criticized, bateson, and, other, biologists, for, their, failure, to, adopt, biometrical, techniques, in, their, study, of, evolution, pearson, criticized, biologists, who, did, not, focus, on, the, statistical, validity, of, their, theories, stating, that, before, we, can, accept, as, a, factor, we, must, have, not, only, shown, its, plausibility, but, if, possible, have, demonstrated, its, quantitative, ability, biologists, had, succumb, to, almost, metaphysical, speculation, as, to, the, causes, of, heredity, which, had, replaced, the, process, of, experimental, data, collection, that, actually, might, allow, scientists, to, narrow, down, potential, theories, for, pearson, laws, of, nature, were, useful, for, making, accurate, predictions, and, for, concisely, describing, trends, in, observed, data, causation, was, the, experience, that, a, certain, sequence, has, occurred, and, recurred, in, the, past, thus, identifying, a, particular, mechanism, of, genetics, was, not, a, worthy, pursuit, of, biologists, who, should, instead, focus, on, mathematical, descriptions, of, empirical, data, this, in, part, led, to, the, fierce, debate, between, the, biometricians, and, the, mendelians, including, bateson, after, bateson, rejected, one, of, pearson, s, manuscripts, that, described, a, new, theory, for, the, variability, of, an, offspring, or, homotyposis, pearson, and, weldon, established, biometrika, in, 1902, although, the, biometric, approach, to, inheritance, eventually, lost, to, the, mendelian, approach, the, techniques, pearson, and, the, biometricians, at, the, time, developed, are, vital, to, studies, of, biology, and, evolution, today, pearson, s, work, was, all, embracing, in, the, wide, application, and, development, of, mathematical, statistics, and, encompassed, the, fields, of, biology, epidemiology, anthropometry, medicine, psychology, and, social, history, in, 1901, with, weldon, and, galton, he, founded, the, journal, biometrika, whose, object, was, the, development, of, statistical, theory, he, edited, this, journal, until, his, death, among, those, who, assisted, pearson, in, his, research, were, a, number, of, female, mathematicians, who, included, beatrice, mabel, cave, browne, cave, frances, cave, browne, cave, and, alice, lee, he, also, founded, the, journal, annals, of, eugenics, now, annals, of, human, genetics, in, 1925, he, published, the, drapers, company, research, memoirs, largely, to, provide, a, record, of, the, output, of, the, department, of, applied, statistics, not, published, elsewhere, pearson, s, thinking, underpins, many, of, the, classical, statistical, methods, which, are, in, common, use, today, examples, of, his, contributions, are, pearson, achieved, widespread, recognition, across, a, range, of, disciplines, and, his, membership, of, and, awards, from, various, professional, bodies, reflects, this, he, was, also, elected, an, honorary, fellow, of, king, s, college, cambridge, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, university, college, london, and, the, royal, society, of, medicine, and, a, member, of, the, actuaries, club, a, sesquicentenary, conference, was, held, in, london, on, 23, march, 2007, to, celebrate, the, 150th, anniversary, of, his, birth, articles, miscellany, most, of, the, biographical, information, above, is, taken, from, the, karl, pearson, page, at, the, department, of, statistical, sciences, at, university, college, london, which, has, been, placed, in, the, public, domain, the, main, source, for, that, page, was, a, list, of, the, papers, and, correspondence, of, karl, pearson, 1857, 1936, held, in, the, manuscripts, room, university, college, london, library, compiled, by, m, merrington, b, blundell, s, burrough, j, golden, and, j, hogarth, and, published, by, the, publications, office, university, college, london, 1983, additional, information, from, entry, for, karl, pearson, in, the,
