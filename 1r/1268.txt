prussia, declaring, himself, king, of, prussia, after, annexing, royal, prussia, from, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, 1772, his, most, significant, accomplishments, include, his, military, successes, in, the, silesian, wars, his, reorganisation, of, the, prussian, army, the, first, partition, of, poland, and, his, patronage, of, the, arts, and, the, enlightenment, prussia, greatly, increased, its, territories, and, became, a, major, military, power, in, europe, under, his, rule, he, became, known, as, frederick, the, great, german, friedrich, der, gro, e, and, was, nicknamed, old, fritz, german, der, alte, fritz, in, his, youth, frederick, was, more, interested, in, music, and, philosophy, than, war, which, led, to, clashes, with, his, authoritarian, father, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, however, upon, ascending, to, the, throne, he, attacked, and, annexed, the, rich, austrian, province, of, silesia, in, 1742, winning, military, acclaim, he, became, an, influential, military, theorist, whose, analyses, emerged, from, his, extensive, personal, battlefield, experience, and, covered, issues, of, strategy, tactics, mobility, and, logistics, frederick, was, a, supporter, of, enlightened, absolutism, stating, that, the, ruler, should, be, the, first, servant, of, the, state, he, modernised, the, prussian, bureaucracy, and, civil, service, and, pursued, religious, policies, that, ranged, from, tolerance, to, segregation, he, reformed, the, judicial, system, and, made, it, possible, for, men, of, lower, status, to, become, judges, and, senior, bureaucrats, frederick, encouraged, immigrants, of, diverse, backgrounds, to, come, to, prussia, while, protestantism, remained, the, favored, faith, he, allowed, religious, freedom, and, tolerated, jews, and, catholics, in, prussia, however, his, actions, were, not, entirely, without, prejudice, he, supported, the, arts, and, philosophers, he, favoured, and, allowed, freedom, of, the, press, and, literature, frederick, was, almost, certainly, homosexual, and, his, sexuality, has, been, the, subject, of, much, study, because, he, died, childless, he, was, succeeded, by, his, nephew, frederick, william, ii, he, is, buried, at, his, favourite, residence, sanssouci, in, potsdam, nearly, all, 19th, century, german, historians, made, frederick, into, a, romantic, model, of, a, glorified, warrior, praising, his, leadership, administrative, efficiency, devotion, to, duty, and, success, in, building, prussia, into, a, great, power, frederick, remained, an, admired, historical, figure, through, germany, s, defeat, in, world, war, i, and, the, nazis, glorified, him, as, a, great, german, leader, prefiguring, adolf, hitler, who, personally, idolised, him, his, reputation, became, less, favourable, in, germany, after, world, war, ii, partly, due, to, being, symbolically, adopted, by, the, nazis, as, a, historical, hero, historians, in, the, 21st, century, tend, to, view, frederick, as, an, outstanding, military, leader, and, capable, monarch, whose, commitment, to, enlightenment, culture, and, administrative, reform, built, the, foundation, that, allowed, the, kingdom, of, prussia, to, contest, the, austrian, habsburgs, for, leadership, among, the, german, states, frederick, was, the, son, of, then, crown, prince, frederick, william, of, prussia, and, sophia, dorothea, of, hanover, he, was, born, between, 11, and, 12, p, m, on, 24, january, 1712, in, the, berlin, palace, and, was, baptised, with, the, single, name, friedrich, by, benjamin, ursinus, von, b, r, on, 31, january, the, birth, was, welcomed, by, his, grandfather, frederick, i, as, his, two, previous, grandsons, had, died, in, infancy, with, the, death, of, frederick, i, in, 1713, his, son, frederick, william, i, became, king, in, prussia, thus, making, young, frederick, the, crown, prince, frederick, had, nine, siblings, who, lived, to, adulthood, he, had, six, sisters, the, eldest, was, wilhelmine, who, became, his, closest, sibling, he, also, had, three, younger, brothers, including, augustus, william, and, henry, the, new, king, wished, for, his, children, to, be, educated, not, as, royalty, but, as, simple, folk, they, were, tutored, by, a, french, woman, madame, de, montbail, who, had, also, educated, frederick, william, frederick, william, i, popularly, dubbed, the, soldier, king, had, created, a, large, and, powerful, army, that, included, a, regiment, of, his, famous, potsdam, giants, he, carefully, managed, the, kingdom, s, wealth, and, developed, a, strong, centralised, government, he, had, a, violent, temper, and, ruled, brandenburg, prussia, with, absolute, authority, in, contrast, frederick, s, mother, sophia, whose, father, george, louis, of, brunswick, l, neburg, had, succeeded, to, the, british, throne, as, king, george, i, in, 1714, was, polite, charismatic, and, learned, the, political, and, personal, differences, between, frederick, s, parents, created, tensions, which, affected, frederick, s, attitude, toward, culture, his, role, as, a, ruler, and, his, relationship, with, his, father, in, his, early, youth, frederick, lived, with, his, mother, and, sister, wilhelmine, although, they, regularly, visited, their, father, s, hunting, lodge, at, k, nigs, wusterhausen, frederick, and, his, older, sister, formed, a, close, relationship, which, lasted, until, her, death, in, 1758, frederick, and, his, sisters, were, brought, up, by, a, huguenot, governess, and, tutor, and, learned, french, and, german, simultaneously, undeterred, by, his, father, s, desire, that, his, education, be, entirely, religious, and, pragmatic, the, young, frederick, developed, a, preference, for, music, literature, and, french, culture, frederick, wilhelm, thought, these, interests, were, effeminate, as, they, clashed, with, his, militarism, resulting, in, his, frequent, beating, and, humiliation, of, frederick, nevertheless, frederick, with, the, help, of, his, tutor, in, latin, jacques, duhan, procured, a, 3, 000, volume, secret, library, of, poetry, greek, and, roman, classics, and, philosophy, to, supplement, his, official, lessons, frederick, william, i, had, been, raised, a, calvinist, in, spite, of, the, lutheran, state, faith, in, prussia, but, feared, he, was, not, one, of, god, s, elect, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, his, son, frederick, being, motivated, by, the, same, concerns, the, king, ordered, that, his, heir, not, be, taught, about, predestination, despite, his, father, s, intention, frederick, appeared, to, have, adopted, a, sense, of, predestination, for, himself, at, age, 16, frederick, formed, an, attachment, to, the, king, s, 17, year, old, page, peter, karl, christoph, von, keith, wilhelmine, recorded, that, the, two, soon, became, inseparable, he, served, my, brother, from, feelings, of, real, devotion, wilhelmine, would, further, record, that, though, i, had, noticed, that, he, was, on, more, familiar, terms, with, this, page, than, was, proper, in, his, position, i, did, not, know, how, intimate, the, friendship, was, as, frederick, was, almost, certainly, homosexual, his, relationship, with, keith, may, have, been, homoerotic, although, the, extent, of, their, intimacy, remains, ambiguous, when, frederick, william, heard, rumours, of, their, relationship, keith, was, sent, away, to, an, unpopular, regiment, near, the, dutch, frontier, in, the, mid, 1720s, queen, sophia, dorothea, attempted, to, arrange, the, marriage, of, frederick, and, his, sister, wilhelmine, to, her, brother, king, george, ii, s, children, amelia, and, frederick, the, heir, apparent, fearing, an, alliance, between, prussia, and, great, britain, field, marshal, von, seckendorff, the, austrian, ambassador, in, berlin, bribed, the, prussian, minister, of, war, field, marshal, von, grumbkow, and, the, prussian, ambassador, in, london, benjamin, reichenbach, the, pair, undermined, the, relationship, between, the, british, and, prussian, courts, using, bribery, and, slander, eventually, frederick, william, became, angered, by, the, idea, of, frederick, being, married, to, an, english, wife, and, under, the, influence, of, the, british, court, instead, he, signed, a, treaty, with, austria, which, vaguely, promised, to, acknowledge, prussia, s, rights, to, the, principalities, of, j, lich, berg, which, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, marriage, proposal, soon, after, his, relationship, with, keith, ended, frederick, became, close, friends, with, hans, hermann, von, katte, a, prussian, officer, several, years, older, than, frederick, who, became, one, of, his, boon, companions, and, may, have, been, his, lover, after, the, english, marriages, became, impossible, frederick, plotted, to, flee, to, britain, with, katte, and, other, junior, army, officers, while, the, royal, retinue, was, near, mannheim, in, the, electorate, of, the, palatinate, robert, keith, peter, keith, s, brother, and, one, of, frederick, s, companions, had, an, attack, of, conscience, when, the, conspirators, were, preparing, to, escape, and, begged, frederick, william, for, forgiveness, on, 5, august, 1730, frederick, and, katte, were, subsequently, arrested, and, imprisoned, in, k, strin, because, they, were, army, officers, who, had, tried, to, flee, prussia, for, britain, frederick, william, accused, the, pair, of, treason, the, king, briefly, threatened, the, crown, prince, with, execution, then, considered, forcing, frederick, to, renounce, the, succession, in, favour, of, his, brother, augustus, william, although, either, option, would, have, been, difficult, to, justify, to, the, imperial, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, king, condemned, katte, to, death, and, forced, frederick, to, watch, his, beheading, at, k, strin, on, 6, november, the, crown, prince, fainted, just, before, the, fatal, blow, frederick, was, granted, a, royal, pardon, and, released, on, 18, november, 1730, although, he, remained, stripped, of, his, military, rank, he, was, forced, to, remain, in, k, strin, and, began, rigorous, schooling, in, statecraft, and, administration, for, the, war, and, estates, departments, tensions, eased, slightly, when, frederick, william, visited, k, strin, a, year, later, and, frederick, was, allowed, to, visit, berlin, for, his, sister, wilhelmine, s, marriage, to, margrave, frederick, of, bayreuth, on, 20, november, 1731, the, crown, prince, returned, to, berlin, after, finally, being, released, from, his, tutelage, at, k, strin, on, 26, february, 1732, on, condition, that, he, marry, elisabeth, christine, of, brunswick, bevern, frederick, william, considered, marrying, frederick, to, elisabeth, of, mecklenburg, schwerin, the, niece, of, empress, anna, of, russia, but, this, plan, was, ardently, opposed, by, prince, eugene, of, savoy, frederick, himself, proposed, marrying, maria, theresa, of, austria, in, return, for, renouncing, the, succession, instead, eugene, persuaded, frederick, william, through, seckendorff, that, the, crown, prince, should, marry, elisabeth, christine, a, protestant, relative, of, the, austrian, habsburgs, frederick, wrote, to, his, sister, that, there, can, be, neither, love, nor, friendship, between, us, and, he, threatened, suicide, but, he, went, along, with, the, wedding, on, 12, june, 1733, he, had, little, in, common, with, his, bride, and, the, marriage, was, resented, as, an, example, of, the, austrian, political, interference, that, had, plagued, prussia, nevertheless, during, their, early, married, life, the, royal, couple, resided, at, the, kronprinzenpalais, in, berlin, later, elisabeth, christine, accompanied, frederick, to, schloss, rheinsberg, where, at, this, time, she, played, an, active, role, in, his, social, life, after, his, father, died, and, he, ascended, the, throne, frederick, separated, from, elisabeth, he, granted, her, the, sch, nhausen, palace, and, apartments, at, the, berliner, stadtschloss, but, he, prohibited, her, from, visiting, his, court, in, potsdam, they, had, no, children, and, frederick, bestowed, the, title, of, the, heir, to, the, throne, prince, of, prussia, on, his, brother, augustus, william, nevertheless, elisabeth, christine, remained, devoted, to, him, frederick, gave, her, all, the, honours, befitting, her, station, but, never, displayed, any, affection, after, their, separation, he, would, only, see, her, on, state, occasions, these, included, visits, to, her, on, her, birthday, among, the, rare, occasions, when, frederick, did, not, wear, military, uniform, in, 1732, frederick, was, restored, to, the, prussian, army, as, colonel, of, the, regiment, von, der, goltz, stationed, near, nauen, and, neuruppin, when, prussia, provided, a, contingent, of, troops, to, aid, the, army, of, the, holy, roman, empire, during, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, frederick, studied, under, prince, eugene, of, savoy, during, the, campaign, against, france, on, the, rhine, he, noted, the, weakness, of, the, imperial, army, under, eugene, s, command, something, that, he, would, capitalise, on, at, austria, s, expense, when, he, took, the, throne, frederick, william, weakened, by, gout, and, seeking, to, reconcile, granted, frederick, schloss, rheinsberg, in, rheinsberg, north, of, neuruppin, at, rheinsberg, frederick, assembled, musicians, actors, and, other, artists, he, spent, his, time, reading, watching, and, acting, in, dramatic, plays, and, composing, and, playing, music, frederick, formed, the, bayard, order, to, discuss, warfare, with, his, friends, heinrich, august, de, la, motte, fouqu, was, made, the, grand, master, of, the, gatherings, later, frederick, regarded, this, time, as, one, of, the, happiest, of, his, life, studying, the, works, of, niccol, machiavelli, such, as, the, prince, was, considered, necessary, for, any, king, in, europe, to, rule, effectively, in, 1739, frederick, finished, his, anti, machiavel, an, idealistic, rebuttal, of, machiavelli, it, was, written, in, french, as, were, all, of, frederick, s, works, and, published, anonymously, in, 1740, but, voltaire, distributed, it, in, amsterdam, to, great, popularity, frederick, s, years, dedicated, to, the, arts, instead, of, politics, ended, upon, the, 1740, death, of, frederick, william, and, his, inheritance, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, frederick, and, his, father, were, reconciled, at, the, latter, s, death, and, frederick, later, admitted, despite, their, constant, conflict, that, frederick, william, had, been, an, effective, ruler, what, a, terrible, man, he, was, but, he, was, just, intelligent, and, skilled, in, the, management, of, affairs, it, was, through, his, efforts, through, his, tireless, labour, that, i, have, been, able, to, accomplish, everything, that, i, have, done, since, frederick, was, twenty, eight, years, old, when, his, father, died, and, he, ascended, to, the, throne, of, prussia, frederick, william, i, had, left, him, with, a, highly, militarised, state, prussia, was, the, twelfth, largest, country, in, europe, in, terms, of, population, but, its, army, was, the, fourth, largest, after, france, russia, and, austria, prussia, had, one, soldier, for, every, 28, citizens, whereas, britain, only, had, one, for, every, 310, and, the, military, absorbed, 86, of, prussia, s, state, budget, the, prussian, infantry, trained, by, frederick, william, i, were, at, the, time, of, frederick, s, accession, arguably, unrivalled, in, discipline, and, firepower, by, 1770, frederick, had, doubled, the, size, of, the, huge, army, he, had, inherited, the, situation, is, summed, up, in, a, widely, translated, and, quoted, aphorism, attributed, to, mirabeau, who, asserted, in, 1786, that, la, prusse, n, est, pas, un, pays, qui, a, une, arm, e, c, est, une, arm, e, qui, a, un, pays, prussia, was, not, a, state, in, possession, of, an, army, but, an, army, in, possession, of, a, state, using, the, resources, his, frugal, father, had, cultivated, frederick, was, eventually, able, to, establish, prussia, as, the, fifth, and, smallest, european, great, power, when, frederick, ascended, the, throne, as, the, third, king, in, prussia, in, 1740, his, realm, consisted, of, scattered, territories, including, cleves, mark, and, ravensberg, in, the, west, of, the, holy, roman, empire, brandenburg, hither, pomerania, and, farther, pomerania, in, the, east, of, the, empire, and, the, kingdom, of, prussia, the, former, duchy, of, prussia, outside, of, the, empire, bordering, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, he, was, titled, king, in, prussia, because, his, kingdom, included, only, part, of, historic, prussia, he, was, to, declare, himself, king, of, prussia, after, the, first, partition, of, poland, in, 1772, when, frederick, became, king, he, faced, vulnerably, disconnected, holdings, with, a, weak, economic, base, to, strengthen, prussia, s, position, he, fought, wars, mainly, against, austria, whose, habsburg, dynasty, had, reigned, as, holy, roman, emperors, continuously, since, the, 15th, century, thus, upon, succeeding, to, the, throne, on, 31, may, 1740, frederick, declined, to, endorse, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1713, a, legal, mechanism, to, ensure, the, inheritance, of, the, habsburg, domains, by, maria, theresa, of, austria, daughter, of, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vi, upon, the, death, of, charles, vi, on, 29, october, 1740, frederick, disputed, the, 23, year, old, maria, theresa, s, right, of, succession, to, the, habsburg, lands, while, simultaneously, asserting, his, own, right, to, the, austrian, province, of, silesia, based, on, a, number, of, old, though, ambiguous, hohenzollern, claims, to, parts, of, silesia, the, first, silesian, war, 1740, 1742, part, of, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, began, on, 16, december, 1740, when, frederick, invaded, and, quickly, occupied, almost, all, of, silesia, within, seven, weeks, though, frederick, justified, his, occupation, on, dynastic, grounds, the, invasion, of, this, militarily, and, politically, vulnerable, part, of, the, habsburg, empire, also, had, the, potential, to, provide, substantial, long, term, economic, and, strategic, benefits, the, occupation, of, silesia, added, one, of, the, most, densely, industrialised, german, regions, to, frederick, s, kingdom, and, gave, it, control, over, the, navigable, oder, river, it, nearly, doubled, prussia, s, population, and, increased, its, territory, by, a, third, it, also, prevented, augustus, iii, king, of, poland, and, elector, of, saxony, from, seeking, to, connect, his, own, disparate, lands, through, silesia, in, late, march, 1741, frederick, set, out, on, campaign, again, to, capture, the, few, remaining, fortresses, within, the, province, that, were, still, holding, out, he, was, surprised, by, the, arrival, of, an, austrian, army, which, he, fought, at, the, battle, of, mollwitz, on, 10, april, 1741, though, frederick, had, served, under, prince, eugene, of, savoy, this, was, his, first, major, battle, in, command, of, an, army, frederick, s, cavalry, was, disorganised, by, a, charge, of, the, austrian, horse, believing, his, forces, had, been, defeated, frederick, galloped, away, to, avoid, capture, leaving, field, marshal, kurt, schwerin, to, lead, the, disciplined, prussian, infantry, to, victory, frederick, would, later, admit, to, humiliation, at, his, abdication, of, command, and, would, state, that, mollwitz, was, his, school, disappointed, with, the, performance, of, his, cavalry, whose, training, his, father, had, neglected, in, favour, of, the, infantry, frederick, spent, much, of, his, time, in, silesia, establishing, a, new, doctrine, for, them, encouraged, by, frederick, s, victory, at, mollwitz, the, french, and, their, ally, the, electorate, of, bavaria, entered, the, war, against, austria, in, early, september, 1741, and, marched, on, prague, meanwhile, frederick, alongside, other, members, of, the, league, of, nymphenburg, sponsored, the, candidacy, of, his, ally, charles, of, bavaria, to, be, elected, holy, roman, emperor, in, late, november, the, franco, bavarian, forces, took, prague, and, charles, was, crowned, king, of, bohemia, subsequently, he, was, elected, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vii, on, 24, january, 1742, after, the, austrians, pulled, their, army, out, of, silesia, to, defend, bohemia, frederick, pursued, them, and, blocked, their, path, to, prague, the, austrians, counter, attacked, on, 17, may, 1742, initiating, the, battle, of, chotusitz, frederick, s, retrained, cavalry, proved, more, effective, than, at, mollwitz, but, once, more, it, was, the, discipline, of, the, prussian, infantry, that, won, the, field, and, allowed, frederick, to, claim, a, major, victory, this, victory, along, with, the, franco, bavarian, forces, capturing, prague, forced, the, austrians, to, seek, peace, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, breslau, negotiated, in, june, 1742, gave, prussia, all, of, silesia, and, glatz, county, with, the, austrians, retaining, only, the, portion, called, austrian, or, czech, silesia, by, 1743, the, austrians, had, subdued, bavaria, and, driven, the, french, out, of, bohemia, frederick, strongly, suspected, maria, theresa, would, resume, war, in, an, attempt, to, recover, silesia, accordingly, he, renewed, his, alliance, with, france, and, preemptively, invaded, bohemia, in, august, 1744, beginning, the, second, silesian, war, in, late, august, 1744, frederick, s, army, had, crossed, the, bohemian, frontier, marched, directly, to, prague, and, laid, siege, to, the, city, which, surrendered, on, 16, september, 1744, after, a, three, day, bombardment, frederick, s, troops, immediately, continued, marching, into, the, heart, of, central, bohemia, but, saxony, had, now, joined, the, war, against, prussia, although, the, combined, austrian, and, saxon, armies, outnumbered, frederick, s, forces, they, refused, to, directly, engage, with, frederick, s, army, harassing, his, supply, lines, instead, frederick, was, forced, to, withdraw, to, silesia, as, winter, approached, in, the, interim, frederick, successfully, claimed, his, inheritance, to, the, minor, territory, of, east, frisia, on, the, north, sea, coast, of, germany, occupying, the, territory, after, its, last, ruler, died, without, issue, in, 1744, in, january, 1745, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vii, of, bavaria, died, taking, bavaria, out, of, the, war, and, allowing, maria, theresa, s, husband, francis, of, lorraine, to, be, eventually, elected, holy, roman, emperor, now, able, to, focus, solely, on, frederick, s, army, the, austrians, who, were, reinforced, by, the, saxons, crossed, the, mountains, to, invade, silesia, after, allowing, them, across, frederick, pinned, them, down, and, decisively, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, hohenfriedberg, on, 4, june, 1745, frederick, subsequently, advanced, into, bohemia, and, defeated, a, counterattack, by, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, soor, frederick, then, turned, toward, dresden, when, he, learned, the, saxons, were, preparing, to, march, on, berlin, however, on, 15, december, 1745, prussian, forces, under, the, command, of, leopold, of, anhalt, dessau, soundly, defeated, the, saxons, at, the, battle, of, kesselsdorf, after, linking, up, his, army, with, leopold, s, frederick, occupied, the, saxon, capitol, of, dresden, forcing, the, saxon, elector, augustus, iii, to, capitulate, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, dresden, signed, on, 25, december, 1745, austria, was, forced, to, adhere, to, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, breslau, giving, silesia, to, prussia, it, was, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, that, frederick, then, 33, years, old, first, became, known, as, the, great, though, frederick, had, withdrawn, from, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, once, austria, guaranteed, his, possession, of, silesia, austria, remained, embroiled, in, the, war, until, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1748, less, than, a, year, after, the, treaty, was, signed, maria, theresa, was, once, more, seeking, allies, particularly, russia, and, france, to, eventually, renew, the, war, with, prussia, to, regain, silesia, during, the, ten, years, of, peace, that, followed, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, dresden, frederick, prepared, to, defend, his, claim, on, silesia, by, further, fortifying, the, province, expanding, his, army, and, reorganising, his, finances, in, 1756, frederick, attempted, to, forestall, britain, s, financing, of, a, russian, army, on, prussia, s, border, by, negotiating, an, alliance, with, britain, at, the, convention, of, westminster, by, which, prussia, would, protect, hanover, against, french, attack, and, britain, would, no, longer, subsidise, russia, this, treaty, triggered, the, diplomatic, revolution, in, which, habsburg, austria, and, bourbon, france, who, had, been, traditional, enemies, allied, together, with, russia, to, defeat, the, anglo, prussian, coalition, to, strengthen, his, strategic, position, against, this, coalition, on, 29, august, 1756, frederick, s, well, prepared, army, preemptively, invaded, saxony, his, invasion, triggered, the, third, silesian, war, and, the, larger, seven, years, war, both, of, which, lasted, until, 1763, he, quickly, captured, dresden, besieged, the, trapped, saxon, army, in, pirna, and, continued, marching, the, remainder, of, his, army, toward, north, bohemia, intending, to, winter, there, at, the, battle, of, lobositz, he, claimed, a, close, victory, against, an, austrian, army, that, was, aiming, to, relieve, pirna, but, afterward, withdrew, his, forces, back, to, saxony, for, the, winter, when, the, saxon, forces, in, pirna, finally, capitulated, in, october, 1756, frederick, forcibly, incorporated, them, into, his, own, army, this, action, along, with, his, initial, invasion, of, neutral, saxony, brought, him, widespread, international, criticism, but, the, conquest, of, saxony, provided, him, with, significant, financial, military, and, strategic, assets, to, sustain, the, war, in, the, early, spring, of, 1757, frederick, again, invaded, bohemia, he, was, victorious, against, the, austrian, army, at, the, battle, of, prague, on, 6, may, 1757, but, his, losses, were, so, great, he, was, unable, to, take, the, city, and, settled, for, besieging, it, on, 18, june, 1757, frederick, suffered, his, first, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, kol, n, which, forced, him, to, abandon, his, invasion, of, bohemia, when, the, french, and, the, austrians, pursued, him, into, saxony, and, silesia, in, the, fall, of, 1757, frederick, defeated, and, repulsed, a, much, larger, franco, austrian, army, at, the, battle, of, rossbach, and, another, austrian, army, at, the, battle, of, leuthen, frederick, hoped, these, two, victories, would, force, austria, to, negotiate, but, maria, theresa, was, determined, not, to, make, peace, until, she, had, recovered, silesia, despite, its, strong, performance, the, losses, suffered, from, combat, disease, and, desertion, had, severely, reduced, the, quality, of, the, prussian, army, in, the, remaining, years, of, the, war, frederick, faced, a, coalition, of, enemies, including, austria, france, russia, sweden, and, the, holy, roman, empire, supported, only, by, britain, and, its, allies, hesse, brunswick, and, hanover, in, 1758, frederick, once, more, took, the, initiative, by, invading, moravia, by, may, he, had, laid, siege, to, olomouc, but, the, austrians, were, able, to, hold, the, town, and, destroyed, frederick, s, supply, train, forcing, him, to, retreat, into, silesia, in, the, meantime, the, russian, army, had, advanced, within, 100, miles, 160, km, east, of, berlin, in, august, he, fought, the, russian, forces, to, a, draw, at, the, battle, of, zorndorf, in, which, nearly, a, third, of, frederick, s, soldiers, were, casualties, he, then, headed, south, to, face, the, austrian, army, in, saxony, there, he, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, hochkirch, on, 14, october, although, the, austrian, forces, were, not, able, to, exploit, their, victory, during, the, 1759, campaign, the, austrian, and, russian, forces, took, the, initiative, which, they, kept, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, they, joined, and, advanced, on, berlin, frederick, s, army, which, consisted, of, a, substantial, number, of, quickly, recruited, half, trained, soldiers, attempted, to, check, them, at, the, battle, of, kunersdorf, on, 12, august, where, he, was, defeated, and, his, troops, were, routed, almost, half, his, army, was, destroyed, and, frederick, almost, became, a, casualty, when, a, bullet, smashed, a, snuffbox, he, was, carrying, nevertheless, the, austro, russian, forces, hesitated, and, stopped, their, advance, for, the, year, an, event, frederick, later, called, the, miracle, of, the, house, of, brandenburg, frederick, spent, the, remainder, of, the, year, in, a, futile, attempt, to, manoeuvre, the, austrians, out, of, saxony, where, they, had, recaptured, dresden, his, effort, cost, him, further, losses, when, his, general, friedrich, august, von, finck, capitulated, at, maxen, on, 20, november, at, the, beginning, of, 1760, the, austrians, moved, to, retake, silesia, where, frederick, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, liegnitz, on, 15, august, the, victory, did, not, allow, frederick, to, regain, the, initiative, or, prevent, russian, and, austrian, troops, from, raiding, berlin, in, october, to, extort, a, ransom, from, the, city, at, the, end, of, the, campaign, season, frederick, fought, his, last, major, engagement, of, the, war, he, won, a, marginal, victory, at, the, battle, of, torgau, on, 3, november, which, secured, berlin, from, further, raids, frederick, became, a, casualty, when, he, was, hit, in, the, chest, by, a, spent, bullet, by, 1761, both, the, austrian, and, prussian, military, forces, were, so, exhausted, that, no, major, battles, were, fought, between, them, frederick, s, position, became, even, more, desperate, in, 1761, when, britain, having, achieved, victory, in, the, american, and, indian, theatres, of, the, war, ended, its, financial, support, for, prussia, after, the, death, of, king, george, ii, frederick, s, uncle, the, russian, forces, also, continued, their, advance, occupying, pomerania, and, parts, of, brandenburg, with, the, russians, slowly, advancing, towards, berlin, it, looked, as, though, prussia, was, about, to, collapse, on, 6, january, 1762, frederick, wrote, to, count, karl, wilhelm, finck, von, finckenstein, we, ought, now, to, think, of, preserving, for, my, nephew, by, way, of, negotiation, whatever, fragments, of, my, territory, we, can, save, from, the, avidity, of, my, enemies, the, sudden, death, of, empress, elizabeth, of, russia, in, january, 1762, led, to, the, succession, of, the, prussophile, peter, iii, her, german, nephew, who, was, also, the, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, this, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, anti, prussian, coalition, peter, immediately, promised, to, end, the, russian, occupation, of, east, prussia, and, pomerania, one, of, peter, iii, s, first, diplomatic, endeavours, was, to, seek, a, prussian, title, frederick, obliged, peter, iii, was, so, enamoured, of, frederick, that, he, not, only, offered, him, the, full, use, of, a, russian, corps, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, against, austria, he, also, wrote, to, frederick, that, he, would, rather, have, been, a, general, in, the, prussian, army, than, tsar, of, russia, more, significantly, russia, s, about, face, from, an, enemy, of, prussia, to, its, patron, rattled, the, leadership, of, sweden, who, hastily, made, peace, with, frederick, with, the, threat, to, his, eastern, borders, over, and, france, also, seeking, peace, after, its, defeats, by, britain, frederick, was, able, to, fight, the, austrians, to, a, stalemate, while, the, ensuing, treaty, of, hubertusburg, returned, the, european, borders, to, what, they, had, been, before, the, seven, years, war, frederick, s, ability, to, retain, silesia, in, spite, of, the, odds, earned, prussia, admiration, throughout, the, german, speaking, territories, a, year, following, the, treaty, of, hubertusburg, catherine, the, great, signed, an, eight, year, alliance, with, prussia, albeit, with, conditions, that, favoured, the, russians, frederick, s, ultimate, success, came, at, a, heavy, financial, cost, to, prussia, part, of, the, burden, was, covered, by, the, anglo, prussian, convention, which, gave, frederick, an, annual, 670, 000, in, british, subsidies, from, 1758, until, 1762, these, subsidies, ceased, when, frederick, allied, with, peter, iii, partly, because, of, the, changed, political, situation, and, because, of, britain, s, decreasing, willingness, to, pay, the, sums, frederick, wanted, frederick, also, financed, the, war, by, devaluing, the, prussian, coin, five, times, debased, coins, were, produced, with, the, help, of, leipzig, mintmasters, veitel, heine, ephraim, daniel, itzig, and, moses, isaacs, he, also, debased, the, coinage, of, saxony, and, poland, this, helped, frederick, cover, over, 20, per, cent, of, the, cost, of, the, war, but, at, the, price, of, causing, massive, inflation, and, economic, upheaval, throughout, the, region, saxony, occupied, by, prussia, for, most, of, the, conflict, was, left, nearly, destitute, as, a, result, while, prussia, lost, no, territory, the, population, and, army, were, severely, depleted, by, constant, combat, and, invasions, by, austria, russia, and, sweden, the, best, of, frederick, s, officer, corps, were, killed, in, the, conflict, although, frederick, managed, to, bring, his, army, up, to, 190, 000, men, by, the, time, the, economy, had, largely, recovered, in, 1772, which, made, it, the, third, largest, army, in, europe, almost, none, of, the, officers, in, this, army, were, veterans, of, his, generation, and, the, king, s, attitude, towards, them, was, extremely, harsh, frederick, suffered, a, number, of, personal, losses, many, of, his, closest, friends, and, family, members, including, his, brother, augustus, william, his, sister, wilhelmine, and, his, mother, had, died, while, frederick, was, engaged, in, the, war, frederick, sought, to, acquire, and, economically, exploit, polish, prussia, as, part, of, his, wider, aim, of, enriching, his, kingdom, as, early, as, 1731, frederick, had, suggested, that, his, country, would, benefit, from, annexing, polish, territory, and, had, described, poland, as, an, artichoke, ready, to, be, consumed, leaf, by, leaf, by, 1752, he, had, prepared, the, ground, for, the, partition, of, poland, lithuania, aiming, to, achieve, his, goal, of, building, a, territorial, bridge, between, pomerania, brandenburg, and, his, east, prussian, provinces, the, new, territories, would, provide, an, increased, tax, base, manpower, for, the, military, and, serve, as, a, surrogate, for, the, overseas, colonies, of, the, other, great, powers, poland, was, vulnerable, to, partition, due, to, poor, governance, and, the, interference, of, foreign, powers, in, its, internal, affairs, frederick, himself, was, partly, responsible, for, this, weakness, by, opposing, attempts, at, financial, and, political, reform, in, poland, and, undermining, the, polish, economy, by, inflating, its, currency, by, his, use, of, polish, coin, dies, the, profits, exceeded, 25, million, thalers, twice, the, peacetime, national, budget, of, prussia, he, thwarted, polish, efforts, to, create, a, stable, economic, system, by, building, a, customs, fort, at, marienwerder, on, the, vistula, poland, s, major, trade, artery, and, by, bombarding, polish, customs, ports, on, the, vistula, frederick, used, poland, s, religious, dissension, to, keep, the, kingdom, open, to, prussian, control, poland, was, predominantly, roman, catholic, but, approximately, ten, per, cent, of, poland, s, population, 600, 000, eastern, orthodox, and, 250, 000, protestants, were, non, catholic, dissenters, during, the, 1760s, the, dissenters, political, importance, was, out, of, proportion, to, their, numbers, although, dissenters, still, had, substantial, rights, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, had, increasingly, been, reducing, their, civic, rights, after, a, period, of, considerable, religious, and, political, freedom, soon, protestants, were, barred, from, public, offices, and, the, sejm, polish, parliament, frederick, took, advantage, of, this, situation, by, becoming, the, protector, of, protestant, interests, in, poland, in, the, name, of, religious, freedom, frederick, further, opened, prussian, control, by, signing, an, alliance, with, catherine, the, great, who, placed, stanis, aw, august, poniatowski, a, former, lover, and, favourite, on, the, polish, throne, after, russia, occupied, the, danubian, principalities, in, 1769, 1770, frederick, s, representative, in, saint, petersburg, his, brother, prince, henry, convinced, frederick, and, maria, theresa, that, the, balance, of, power, would, be, maintained, by, a, tripartite, division, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, instead, of, russia, taking, land, from, the, ottomans, they, agreed, to, the, first, partition, of, poland, in, 1772, without, war, frederick, acquired, most, of, royal, prussia, annexing, 38, 000, square, kilometres, 15, 000, sq, mi, and, 600, 000, inhabitants, although, frederick, s, share, of, the, partition, was, the, smallest, of, the, partitioning, powers, the, lands, he, acquired, had, roughly, the, same, economic, value, as, the, others, and, had, great, strategic, value, the, newly, created, province, of, west, prussia, connected, east, prussia, and, farther, pomerania, granted, prussia, control, of, the, mouth, of, the, vistula, river, and, cut, off, poland, s, sea, trade, maria, theresa, had, only, reluctantly, agreed, to, the, partition, to, which, frederick, sarcastically, commented, she, cries, but, she, takes, frederick, undertook, the, exploitation, of, polish, territory, under, the, pretext, of, an, enlightened, civilising, mission, that, emphasised, the, supposed, cultural, superiority, of, prussian, ways, he, saw, polish, prussia, as, barbaric, and, uncivilised, describing, the, inhabitants, as, slovenly, polish, trash, his, long, term, goal, was, to, remove, the, poles, through, germanisation, which, included, appropriating, polish, crown, lands, and, monasteries, introducing, a, military, draft, encouraging, german, settlement, in, the, region, and, implementing, a, tax, policy, that, disproportionately, impoverished, polish, nobles, late, in, his, life, frederick, involved, prussia, in, the, low, scale, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, in, 1778, in, which, he, stifled, austrian, attempts, to, exchange, the, austrian, netherlands, for, bavaria, for, their, part, the, austrians, tried, to, pressure, the, french, to, participate, in, the, war, of, bavarian, succession, since, there, were, guarantees, under, consideration, related, to, the, peace, of, westphalia, clauses, which, linked, the, bourbon, dynasty, of, france, and, the, habsburg, lorraine, dynasty, of, austria, unfortunately, for, the, austrian, emperor, joseph, ii, the, french, court, was, unwilling, to, support, him, because, they, were, already, supporting, the, american, revolutionaries, in, north, america, and, the, idea, of, an, alliance, with, austria, had, been, unpopular, in, france, since, the, end, of, the, seven, years, war, frederick, ended, up, as, a, beneficiary, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, as, austria, was, left, more, or, less, isolated, saxony, and, russia, both, of, which, had, been, austria, s, allies, in, the, seven, years, war, were, now, allied, with, prussia, although, frederick, was, weary, of, war, in, his, old, age, he, was, determined, not, to, allow, austrian, dominance, in, german, affairs, frederick, and, prince, henry, marched, the, prussian, army, into, bohemia, to, confront, joseph, s, army, but, the, two, forces, ultimately, descended, into, a, stalemate, largely, living, off, the, land, and, skirmishing, frederick, s, longtime, rival, maria, theresa, who, was, joseph, s, mother, and, his, co, ruler, did, not, want, a, new, war, with, prussia, and, secretly, sent, messengers, to, frederick, to, discuss, peace, negotiations, finally, catherine, ii, of, russia, threatened, to, enter, the, war, on, frederick, s, side, if, peace, was, not, negotiated, and, joseph, reluctantly, dropped, his, claim, to, bavaria, when, joseph, tried, the, scheme, again, in, 1784, frederick, created, the, f, rstenbund, league, of, princes, allowing, himself, to, be, seen, as, a, defender, of, german, liberties, to, stop, joseph, ii, s, attempts, to, acquire, bavaria, frederick, enlisted, the, help, of, the, electors, of, hanover, and, saxony, along, with, several, other, minor, german, princes, perhaps, even, more, significantly, frederick, benefited, from, the, defection, of, the, senior, prelate, of, the, german, church, the, archbishop, of, mainz, who, was, also, the, arch, chancellor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, further, strengthened, frederick, and, prussia, s, standing, amid, the, german, states, in, his, earliest, published, work, the, anti, machiavel, and, his, later, testament, politique, political, testament, frederick, wrote, that, the, sovereign, was, the, first, servant, of, the, state, frederick, helped, transform, prussia, from, a, european, backwater, to, an, economically, strong, and, politically, reformed, state, he, protected, his, industries, with, high, tariffs, and, minimal, restrictions, on, domestic, trade, he, increased, the, freedom, of, speech, in, press, and, literature, abolished, most, uses, of, judicial, torture, and, limited, which, crimes, could, be, punished, by, death, working, with, his, grand, chancellor, samuel, von, cocceji, he, reformed, the, judicial, system, and, made, it, more, efficient, and, he, moved, the, courts, toward, greater, legal, equality, of, all, citizens, by, removing, special, courts, for, special, social, classes, the, reform, was, completed, after, frederick, s, death, resulting, in, the, prussian, law, code, of, 1794, which, balanced, absolutism, with, human, rights, and, corporate, privilege, with, equality, before, the, law, reception, to, the, law, code, was, mixed, as, it, was, often, viewed, as, contradictory, frederick, strove, to, put, prussia, s, fiscal, system, in, order, in, january, 1750, johann, philipp, graumann, was, appointed, as, frederick, s, confidential, adviser, on, finance, military, affairs, and, royal, possessions, and, the, director, general, of, all, mint, facilities, graumann, s, currency, reform, slightly, lowered, the, silver, content, of, prussian, thaler, from, 1, 12, cologne, mark, of, silver, to, 1, 14, which, brought, the, metal, content, of, the, thaler, into, alignment, with, its, face, value, and, it, standardised, the, prussian, coinage, system, as, a, result, prussian, coins, which, had, been, leaving, the, country, nearly, as, fast, as, they, were, minted, remained, in, circulation, in, prussia, frederick, estimated, that, he, earned, about, one, million, thalers, in, profits, on, the, seignorage, the, coin, eventually, became, universally, accepted, beyond, prussia, and, helped, increase, industry, and, trade, a, gold, coin, the, friedrich, d, or, was, also, minted, to, oust, the, dutch, ducat, from, the, baltic, trade, however, the, fixed, ratio, between, gold, and, silver, led, to, the, gold, coins, being, perceived, as, more, valuable, which, caused, them, to, leave, circulation, in, prussia, unable, to, meet, frederick, s, expectations, for, profit, graumann, was, removed, in, 1754, although, frederick, s, debasement, of, the, coinage, to, fund, the, seven, years, war, left, the, prussian, monetary, system, in, disarray, the, mint, edict, of, may, 1763, brought, it, back, to, stability, by, fixing, rates, at, which, depreciated, coins, would, be, accepted, and, requiring, tax, payments, in, currency, of, prewar, value, this, resulted, in, a, shortage, of, ready, money, but, frederick, controlled, prices, by, releasing, the, grain, stocks, he, held, in, reserve, for, military, campaigns, many, other, rulers, soon, followed, the, steps, of, frederick, in, reforming, their, own, currencies, the, functionality, and, stability, of, the, reform, made, the, prussian, monetary, system, the, standard, in, northern, germany, around, 1751, frederick, founded, the, emden, company, to, promote, trade, with, china, he, introduced, the, lottery, fire, insurance, and, a, giro, discount, and, credit, bank, to, stabilise, the, economy, one, of, frederick, s, achievements, after, the, seven, years, war, included, the, control, of, grain, prices, whereby, government, storehouses, would, enable, the, civilian, population, to, survive, in, needy, regions, where, the, harvest, was, poor, he, commissioned, johann, ernst, gotzkowsky, to, promote, the, trade, and, to, take, on, the, competition, with, france, put, a, silk, factory, where, 1, 500, people, found, employment, frederick, followed, gotzkowsky, s, recommendations, in, the, field, of, toll, levies, and, import, restrictions, when, gotzkowsky, asked, for, a, deferral, during, the, amsterdam, banking, crisis, of, 1763, frederick, took, over, his, porcelain, factory, now, known, as, kpm, frederick, modernised, the, prussian, civil, service, and, promoted, religious, tolerance, throughout, his, realm, to, attract, more, settlers, in, east, prussia, with, the, help, of, french, experts, he, organised, a, system, of, indirect, taxation, which, provided, the, state, with, more, revenue, than, direct, taxation, though, french, officials, administering, it, may, have, pocketed, some, of, the, profit, he, established, new, regulations, for, tax, officials, to, reduce, graft, in, 1781, frederick, made, coffee, a, royal, monopoly, and, employed, disabled, soldiers, the, coffee, sniffers, to, spy, on, citizens, illegally, roasting, coffee, much, to, the, annoyance, of, the, general, population, though, frederick, started, many, reforms, during, his, reign, his, ability, to, see, them, to, fulfillment, was, not, as, disciplined, or, thorough, as, his, military, successes, in, contrast, to, his, devoutly, calvinist, father, frederick, was, a, religious, sceptic, and, has, been, described, as, a, deist, frederick, was, pragmatic, about, religious, faith, three, times, during, his, life, he, presented, his, own, confession, of, christian, faith, during, his, imprisonment, after, katte, s, execution, in, 1730, after, his, conquest, of, silesia, in, 1741, and, just, before, the, start, of, the, seven, years, war, in, 1756, in, each, case, these, confessions, also, served, personal, or, political, goals, he, tolerated, all, faiths, in, his, realm, but, protestantism, remained, the, favoured, religion, and, catholics, were, not, chosen, for, higher, state, positions, frederick, wanted, development, throughout, the, country, adapted, to, the, needs, of, each, region, he, was, interested, in, attracting, a, diversity, of, skills, whether, from, jesuit, teachers, huguenot, citizens, or, jewish, merchants, and, bankers, frederick, retained, jesuits, as, teachers, in, silesia, warmia, and, the, netze, district, recognising, their, educational, activities, as, an, asset, for, the, nation, he, continued, to, support, them, after, their, suppression, by, pope, clement, xiv, he, befriended, the, roman, catholic, prince, bishop, of, warmia, ignacy, krasicki, whom, he, asked, to, consecrate, st, hedwig, s, cathedral, in, 1773, he, accepted, countless, protestant, weavers, from, bohemia, who, were, fleeing, from, the, devoutly, catholic, rule, of, maria, theresa, granting, them, freedom, from, taxes, and, military, service, constantly, looking, for, new, colonists, he, encouraged, immigration, by, repeatedly, emphasising, that, nationality, and, religion, were, of, no, concern, to, him, this, policy, allowed, prussia, s, population, to, recover, very, quickly, from, its, considerable, losses, during, frederick, s, three, wars, though, frederick, was, known, to, be, more, tolerant, of, jews, and, roman, catholics, than, many, neighbouring, german, states, his, practical, minded, tolerance, was, not, fully, unprejudiced, frederick, wrote, in, his, testament, politique, we, have, too, many, jews, in, the, towns, they, are, needed, on, the, polish, border, because, in, these, areas, hebrews, alone, perform, trade, as, soon, as, you, get, away, from, the, frontier, the, jews, become, a, disadvantage, they, form, cliques, they, deal, in, contraband, and, get, up, to, all, manner, of, rascally, tricks, which, are, detrimental, to, christian, burghers, and, merchants, i, have, never, persecuted, anyone, from, this, or, any, other, sect, i, think, however, it, would, be, prudent, to, pay, attention, so, that, their, numbers, do, not, increase, the, success, in, integrating, the, jews, into, areas, of, society, where, frederick, encouraged, them, can, be, seen, by, gerson, von, bleichr, der, s, role, during, the, 19th, century, in, financing, otto, von, bismarck, s, efforts, to, unite, germany, frederick, was, less, tolerant, of, catholicism, in, his, occupied, territories, in, silesia, he, disregarded, canon, law, to, install, clergy, who, were, loyal, to, him, in, polish, prussia, he, confiscated, the, roman, catholic, church, s, goods, and, property, making, clergy, dependent, on, the, government, for, their, pay, and, defining, how, they, were, to, perform, their, duties, like, many, leading, enlightenment, figures, frederick, was, a, freemason, having, joined, during, a, trip, to, brunswick, in, 1738, his, membership, legitimised, the, group, s, presence, in, prussia, and, protected, it, against, charges, of, subversion, in, 1786, he, became, the, first, sovereign, grand, commander, of, the, supreme, council, of, the, 33rd, degree, his, double, headed, eagle, emblem, was, used, for, 32nd, and, 33rd, degree, masons, following, the, adoption, of, seven, additional, degrees, to, the, masonic, rite, frederick, s, religious, views, resulted, in, his, condemnation, by, the, anti, revolutionary, french, jesuit, augustin, barruel, in, his, 1797, book, m, moires, pour, servir, l, histoire, du, jacobinisme, memoirs, illustrating, the, history, of, jacobinism, barruel, described, an, influential, conspiracy, theory, that, accused, king, frederick, of, taking, part, in, a, plot, which, led, to, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, and, having, been, the, secret, protector, and, adviser, of, fellow, conspirators, voltaire, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, denis, diderot, who, all, sought, to, destroy, christianity, and, foment, rebellion, against, kings, and, monarchs, frederick, was, keenly, interested, in, land, use, especially, draining, swamps, and, opening, new, farmland, for, colonisers, to, increase, the, kingdom, s, food, supply, he, called, it, peuplierungspolitik, peopling, policy, about, 1, 200, new, villages, were, founded, in, his, reign, he, told, voltaire, whoever, improves, the, soil, cultivates, land, lying, waste, and, drains, swamps, is, making, conquests, from, barbarism, using, improved, technology, enabled, him, to, create, new, farmland, through, a, massive, drainage, programme, in, the, country, s, oderbruch, marshland, this, programme, created, roughly, 60, 000, hectares, 150, 000, acres, of, new, farmland, but, eliminated, vast, swaths, of, natural, habitat, destroyed, the, region, s, biodiversity, and, displaced, numerous, native, plant, and, animal, communities, frederick, saw, this, project, as, the, taming, and, conquering, of, nature, considering, uncultivated, land, useless, an, attitude, that, reflected, his, enlightenment, era, rationalist, sensibilities, he, presided, over, the, construction, of, canals, for, bringing, crops, to, market, and, introduced, new, crops, especially, the, potato, and, the, turnip, to, the, country, for, this, he, was, sometimes, called, der, kartoffelk, nig, the, potato, king, frederick, s, potato, campaign, demonstrated, an, enlightenment, view, of, promoting, scientific, agriculture, and, challenging, tradition, for, the, benefit, of, the, populace, frederick, s, interest, in, land, reclamation, may, have, resulted, from, his, upbringing, as, a, child, his, father, frederick, william, i, made, young, frederick, work, in, the, region, s, provinces, teaching, the, boy, about, the, area, s, agriculture, and, geography, this, created, an, interest, in, cultivation, and, development, that, the, boy, retained, when, he, became, ruler, frederick, founded, the, first, veterinary, school, in, prussia, unusually, for, the, time, and, his, aristocratic, background, he, criticised, hunting, as, cruel, rough, and, uneducated, when, someone, once, asked, frederick, why, he, did, not, wear, spurs, on, horseback, he, replied, try, sticking, a, fork, into, your, naked, stomach, and, you, will, soon, see, why, he, loved, dogs, and, his, horse, and, wanted, to, be, buried, with, his, greyhounds, in, 1752, he, wrote, to, his, sister, wilhelmine, that, people, indifferent, to, loyal, animals, would, not, be, devoted, to, their, human, comrades, he, was, also, close, to, nature, and, issued, decrees, to, protect, plants, frederick, was, a, patron, of, music, the, court, musicians, he, supported, included, c, p, e, bach, carl, heinrich, graun, and, franz, benda, a, meeting, with, johann, sebastian, bach, in, 1747, in, potsdam, led, to, bach, s, writing, the, musical, offering, he, was, a, talented, musician, and, composer, in, his, own, right, playing, the, transverse, flute, and, composing, 121, sonatas, for, flute, and, continuo, four, concertos, for, flute, and, strings, four, sinfonias, three, military, marches, and, seven, arias, additionally, the, hohenfriedberger, marsch, was, allegedly, written, by, frederick, to, commemorate, his, victory, in, the, battle, of, hohenfriedberg, his, flute, sonatas, were, often, composed, in, collaboration, with, johann, joachim, quantz, who, was, frederick, s, occasional, music, tutor, in, his, youth, and, joined, his, court, as, composer, and, flute, maker, in, 1741, frederick, s, flute, sonatas, are, written, in, the, baroque, style, in, which, flute, plays, the, melody, sometimes, imitating, operatic, vocal, styles, like, the, aria, and, recitative, while, the, accompaniment, was, usually, played, by, just, one, instrument, per, part, to, highlight, the, delicate, sound, of, the, flute, frederick, wrote, sketches, outlines, and, libretti, for, opera, that, were, included, as, part, of, the, repertoire, for, the, berlin, opera, house, these, works, which, were, often, completed, in, collaboration, with, graun, included, the, operas, coriolano, 1749, silla, 1753, montezuma, 1755, and, il, tempio, d, amore, 1756, frederick, saw, opera, as, playing, an, important, role, in, imparting, enlightenment, philosophy, using, it, to, critique, superstition, and, the, pietism, that, still, held, sway, in, prussia, he, attempted, to, broaden, access, to, opera, by, making, admission, to, it, free, frederick, also, wrote, philosophical, works, publishing, some, of, his, writings, under, the, title, of, the, works, of, a, sans, souci, philosopher, frederick, corresponded, with, key, french, enlightenment, figures, including, voltaire, who, at, one, point, declared, frederick, to, be, a, philosopher, king, and, the, marquis, d, argens, whom, he, appointed, as, royal, chamberlain, in, 1742, and, later, as, the, director, of, the, prussian, academy, of, arts, and, berlin, state, opera, his, openness, to, philosophy, had, its, limits, he, did, not, admire, the, encyclop, distes, or, the, french, intellectual, avant, garde, of, his, time, though, he, did, shelter, rousseau, from, persecution, for, years, once, he, ascended, the, prussian, throne, he, found, it, increasingly, difficult, to, apply, the, philosophical, ideas, of, his, youth, to, his, role, as, king, like, many, european, rulers, of, the, time, who, were, influenced, by, the, prestige, of, louis, xiv, of, france, and, his, court, frederick, adopted, french, tastes, and, manners, though, in, frederick, s, case, the, extent, of, his, francophile, tendencies, might, have, been, a, reaction, to, the, austerity, of, the, family, environment, created, by, his, father, who, had, a, deep, aversion, for, france, and, promoted, an, austere, culture, he, was, educated, by, french, tutors, and, almost, all, the, books, in, his, library, were, written, in, french, french, was, frederick, s, preferred, language, for, speaking, and, writing, though, he, had, to, rely, on, proofreaders, to, correct, his, difficulties, with, spelling, though, frederick, used, german, as, his, working, language, with, his, administration, and, with, the, army, he, claimed, to, have, never, learned, it, properly, and, never, fully, mastered, speaking, or, writing, it, he, disliked, the, german, language, thinking, it, inharmonious, and, awkward, he, once, commented, that, german, authors, pile, parenthesis, upon, parenthesis, and, often, you, find, only, at, the, end, of, an, entire, page, the, verb, on, which, depends, the, meaning, of, the, whole, sentence, he, considered, the, german, culture, of, his, time, particularly, literature, and, theatre, to, be, inferior, to, that, of, france, believing, that, it, had, been, hindered, by, the, devastation, of, the, thirty, years, war, he, suggested, that, it, could, eventually, equal, its, rivals, but, this, would, require, a, complete, codification, of, the, german, language, the, emergence, of, talented, german, authors, and, extensive, patronage, of, the, arts, by, germanic, rulers, which, he, believed, would, take, a, century, or, more, frederick, s, love, of, french, culture, was, not, without, limits, he, disapproved, of, the, luxury, and, extravagance, of, the, french, royal, court, and, ridiculed, german, princes, especially, augustus, iii, who, imitated, french, sumptuousness, his, own, court, remained, quite, spartan, frugal, and, small, and, restricted, to, a, limited, circle, of, close, friends, similar, to, his, father, s, court, though, frederick, and, his, friends, were, far, more, culturally, inclined, despite, his, distaste, for, the, german, language, frederick, sponsored, the, k, nigliche, deutsche, gesellschaft, royal, german, society, founded, in, 1741, the, aim, of, which, was, to, promote, and, develop, the, german, language, he, allowed, the, association, to, be, titled, royal, and, have, its, seat, at, the, k, nigsberg, castle, but, he, does, not, seem, to, have, taken, much, interest, in, its, work, frederick, also, promoted, the, use, of, german, instead, of, latin, in, law, as, in, the, legal, document, project, des, corporis, juris, fridericiani, project, of, the, frederician, body, of, laws, which, was, written, in, german, with, the, aim, of, being, clear, and, easily, understandable, it, was, under, his, reign, that, berlin, became, an, important, centre, of, german, enlightenment, frederick, had, many, famous, buildings, constructed, in, his, capital, berlin, most, of, which, still, stand, today, such, as, the, berlin, state, opera, the, royal, library, today, the, state, library, berlin, st, hedwig, s, cathedral, and, prince, henry, s, palace, now, the, site, of, humboldt, university, a, number, of, the, buildings, including, the, berlin, state, opera, house, a, wing, of, schloss, charlottenburg, and, the, renovation, of, rheinsburg, during, frederick, s, residence, were, built, in, a, unique, rococo, style, that, frederick, developed, in, collaboration, with, georg, wenzeslaus, von, knobelsdorff, this, style, became, known, as, frederician, rococo, and, is, epitomised, by, frederick, s, summer, palace, sanssouci, french, for, carefree, or, without, worry, his, primary, residence, and, private, refuge, as, a, great, patron, of, the, arts, frederick, was, a, collector, of, paintings, and, ancient, sculptures, his, favourite, artist, was, jean, antoine, watteau, his, sense, of, aesthetics, can, be, seen, in, the, picture, gallery, at, sanssouci, which, presents, architecture, painting, sculpture, and, the, decorative, arts, as, a, unified, whole, the, gilded, stucco, decorations, of, the, ceilings, were, created, by, johann, michael, merck, and, carl, joseph, sartori, 17th, century, flemish, and, dutch, paintings, filled, the, western, wing, and, the, gallery, s, central, building, while, italian, paintings, from, the, high, renaissance, and, baroque, were, exhibited, in, the, eastern, wing, sculptures, were, arranged, symmetrically, or, in, rows, in, relation, to, the, architecture, when, frederick, ascended, the, throne, in, 1740, he, reinstituted, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, berlin, academy, which, his, father, had, closed, down, as, an, economy, measure, frederick, s, goal, was, to, make, berlin, a, european, cultural, centre, that, rivalled, london, and, paris, he, invited, intellectuals, from, across, europe, to, join, the, academy, made, french, the, official, language, and, made, speculative, philosophy, the, most, important, topic, of, study, the, membership, was, strong, in, mathematics, and, philosophy, and, included, immanuel, kant, d, alembert, pierre, louis, de, maupertuis, and, tienne, de, condillac, however, the, academy, was, in, a, crisis, for, two, decades, at, mid, century, due, in, part, to, scandals, and, internal, rivalries, such, as, the, debates, between, newtonianism, and, leibnizian, views, and, the, personality, conflict, between, voltaire, and, maupertuis, at, a, higher, level, maupertuis, director, of, the, berlin, academy, from, 1746, to, 1759, and, a, monarchist, argued, that, the, action, of, individuals, was, shaped, by, the, character, of, the, institution, that, contained, them, and, they, worked, for, the, glory, of, the, state, by, contrast, d, alembert, took, a, republican, approach, and, emphasised, the, international, republic, of, letters, as, the, vehicle, for, scientific, advance, by, 1789, the, academy, had, gained, international, repute, while, making, major, contributions, to, german, culture, and, thought, for, example, the, mathematicians, he, recruited, for, the, berlin, academy, including, leonhard, euler, joseph, louis, lagrange, johann, heinrich, lambert, and, johann, castillon, made, it, a, world, class, centre, for, mathematical, research, other, intellectuals, attracted, to, the, philosopher, s, kingdom, were, francesco, algarotti, d, argens, and, julien, offray, de, la, mettrie, contrary, to, his, father, s, fears, frederick, became, a, capable, military, commander, with, the, exception, of, his, first, battlefield, experience, at, the, battle, of, mollwitz, frederick, proved, himself, courageous, in, battle, he, frequently, led, his, military, forces, personally, and, had, multiple, horses, shot, from, under, him, during, battle, during, his, reign, he, commanded, the, prussian, army, at, sixteen, major, battles, and, various, sieges, skirmishes, and, other, actions, ultimately, obtaining, almost, all, his, political, objectives, he, is, often, admired, for, his, tactical, skills, especially, his, use, of, the, oblique, order, of, battle, an, attack, focused, on, one, flank, of, the, opposing, line, allowing, a, local, advantage, even, if, his, forces, were, outnumbered, overall, even, more, important, were, his, operational, successes, especially, the, use, of, interior, lines, to, prevent, the, unification, of, numerically, superior, opposing, armies, and, defend, the, prussian, core, territory, napoleon, bonaparte, saw, the, prussian, king, as, a, military, commander, of, the, first, rank, after, napoleon, s, victory, over, the, fourth, coalition, in, 1807, he, visited, frederick, s, tomb, in, potsdam, and, remarked, to, his, officers, gentlemen, if, this, man, were, still, alive, i, would, not, be, here, napoleon, frequently, pored, through, frederick, s, campaign, narratives, and, had, a, statuette, of, him, placed, in, his, personal, cabinet, frederick, s, most, notable, military, victories, on, the, battlefield, were, the, battle, of, hohenfriedberg, a, tactical, victory, fought, during, the, war, of, austrian, succession, in, june, 1745, the, battle, of, rossbach, where, frederick, defeated, a, combined, franco, austrian, army, of, 41, 000, with, only, 21, 000, soldiers, 10, 000, dead, for, the, franco, austrian, side, with, only, 550, casualties, for, prussia, and, the, battle, of, leuthen, in, which, frederick, s, 39, 000, troops, inflicted, 22, 000, casualties, including, 12, 000, prisoners, on, charles, of, lorraine, s, austrian, force, of, 65, 000, frederick, believed, that, creating, alliances, was, necessary, as, prussia, did, not, have, the, resources, of, nations, like, france, or, austria, though, his, reign, was, regularly, involved, in, war, he, did, not, advocate, for, protracted, warfare, he, stated, that, for, prussia, wars, should, be, short, and, quick, long, wars, would, destroy, the, army, s, discipline, depopulate, the, country, and, exhaust, its, resources, frederick, was, an, influential, military, theorist, whose, analysis, emerged, from, his, extensive, personal, battlefield, experience, and, covered, issues, of, strategy, tactics, mobility, and, logistics, emperor, joseph, ii, wrote, when, the, king, of, prussia, speaks, on, problems, connected, with, the, art, of, war, which, he, has, studied, intensively, and, on, which, he, has, read, every, conceivable, book, then, everything, is, taut, solid, and, uncommonly, instructive, there, are, no, circumlocutions, he, gives, factual, and, historical, proof, of, the, assertions, he, makes, for, he, is, well, versed, in, history, robert, citino, describes, frederick, s, strategic, approach, in, war, he, usually, saw, one, path, to, victory, and, that, was, fixing, the, enemy, army, in, place, maneuvering, near, or, even, around, it, to, give, himself, a, favorable, position, for, the, attack, and, then, smashing, it, with, an, overwhelming, blow, from, an, unexpected, direction, he, was, the, most, aggressive, field, commander, of, the, century, perhaps, of, all, time, and, one, who, constantly, pushed, the, limits, of, the, possible, the, historian, dennis, showalter, argues, the, king, was, also, more, consistently, willing, than, any, of, his, contemporaries, to, seek, decision, through, offensive, operations, these, offensive, operations, were, not, acts, of, blind, aggression, frederick, considered, foresight, to, be, among, the, most, important, attributes, when, fighting, much, of, the, structure, of, the, modern, german, general, staff, owed, its, existence, and, design, to, frederick, along, with, the, accompanying, autonomy, given, to, commanders, in, the, field, according, to, citino, when, later, generations, of, prussian, german, staff, officers, looked, back, to, the, age, of, frederick, they, saw, a, commander, who, repeatedly, even, joyfully, risked, everything, on, a, single, day, s, battle, his, army, his, kingdom, often, his, very, life, as, far, as, frederick, was, concerned, there, were, two, major, battlefield, considerations, speed, of, march, and, speed, of, fire, confident, in, the, performance, of, men, he, selected, for, command, when, compared, to, those, of, his, enemy, frederick, once, quipped, that, a, general, considered, audacious, in, another, country, would, be, ordinary, in, prussia, because, prussian, generals, will, dare, anything, that, is, possible, for, men, to, execute, after, the, seven, years, war, the, prussian, military, acquired, a, formidable, reputation, across, europe, esteemed, for, efficiency, and, success, in, battle, it, became, a, model, emulated, by, other, european, powers, particularly, russia, and, france, frederick, continues, to, be, held, in, high, regard, as, a, military, theorist, and, has, been, described, as, representing, the, embodiment, of, the, art, of, war, near, the, end, of, his, life, frederick, grew, increasingly, solitary, his, circle, of, close, friends, at, sanssouci, gradually, died, off, with, few, replacements, and, frederick, became, increasingly, critical, and, arbitrary, to, the, frustration, of, the, civil, service, and, officer, corps, frederick, was, immensely, popular, among, the, prussian, people, because, of, his, enlightened, reforms, and, military, glory, the, citizens, of, berlin, always, cheered, him, when, he, returned, from, administrative, or, military, reviews, he, was, nicknamed, der, alte, fritz, the, old, fritz, by, the, prussian, people, and, this, name, became, part, of, his, legacy, frederick, derived, little, pleasure, from, his, popularity, preferring, instead, the, company, of, his, pet, italian, greyhounds, whom, he, referred, to, as, his, marquises, de, pompadour, as, a, jibe, at, the, french, royal, mistress, even, in, his, late, 60s, and, early, 70s, when, he, was, increasingly, crippled, by, asthma, gout, and, other, ailments, he, rose, before, dawn, drank, six, to, eight, cups, of, coffee, a, day, laced, with, mustard, and, peppercorns, and, attended, to, state, business, with, characteristic, tenacity, on, the, morning, of, 17, august, 1786, frederick, died, in, an, armchair, in, his, study, at, sanssouci, aged, 74, he, left, instructions, that, he, should, be, buried, next, to, his, greyhounds, on, the, vineyard, terrace, of, sanssouci, his, nephew, and, successor, frederick, william, ii, instead, ordered, he, be, entombed, next, to, his, father, in, the, potsdam, garrison, church, near, the, end, of, world, war, ii, german, dictator, adolf, hitler, ordered, frederick, s, coffin, to, be, hidden, in, a, salt, mine, to, protect, it, from, destruction, the, united, states, army, relocated, the, remains, to, marburg, in, 1946, in, 1953, the, coffins, of, frederick, and, his, father, were, moved, to, burg, hohenzollern, on, the, 205th, anniversary, of, his, death, on, 17, august, 1991, frederick, s, coffin, lay, in, state, in, the, court, of, honour, at, sanssouci, covered, by, a, prussian, flag, and, escorted, by, a, bundeswehr, guard, of, honour, after, nightfall, frederick, s, body, was, interred, in, the, vineyard, terrace, in, the, crypt, he, had, built, there, without, pomp, in, accordance, with, his, will, visitors, to, his, grave, often, place, potatoes, on, the, gravestone, in, honour, of, his, role, in, promoting, the, potato, in, prussia, frederick, s, legacy, has, been, subject, to, a, wide, variety, of, interpretations, for, instance, thomas, carlyle, s, history, of, frederick, the, great, 8, vol, 1858, 1865, emphasised, the, power, of, one, great, hero, in, this, case, frederick, to, shape, history, in, german, memory, frederick, became, a, great, national, icon, and, many, germans, said, he, was, the, greatest, monarch, in, modern, history, these, claims, particularly, were, popular, in, the, 19th, century, for, example, german, historians, often, made, him, the, romantic, model, of, a, glorified, warrior, praising, his, leadership, administrative, efficiency, devotion, to, duty, and, success, in, building, up, prussia, to, a, leading, role, in, europe, frederick, s, popularity, as, a, heroic, figure, remained, high, in, germany, even, after, world, war, i, between, 1933, and, 1945, the, nazis, glorified, frederick, as, a, precursor, to, adolf, hitler, in, an, attempt, to, legitimise, the, nazi, regime, propaganda, minister, joseph, goebbels, commissioned, artists, to, render, fanciful, images, of, frederick, bismarck, and, hitler, together, to, create, a, sense, of, a, historical, continuum, amongst, them, throughout, world, war, ii, hitler, often, compared, himself, to, frederick, and, he, kept, a, copy, of, anton, graff, s, portrait, of, frederick, with, him, to, the, end, in, the, f, hrerbunker, in, berlin, after, the, war, the, role, of, prussia, in, german, history, was, minimised, and, frederick, s, reputation, was, downgraded, in, both, east, and, west, germany, partly, due, to, the, nazis, fascination, with, him, and, his, connection, with, prussian, militarism, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, political, attitudes, towards, frederick, s, image, were, ambivalent, particularly, in, communist, east, germany, for, example, immediately, after, world, war, ii, images, of, prussia, were, removed, from, public, spaces, including, frederick, s, equestrian, statue, on, the, unter, den, linden, but, in, 1980, his, statue, was, re, erected, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, frederick, s, reputation, has, continued, to, grow, in, reunified, germany, in, the, 21st, century, the, view, of, frederick, as, a, capable, and, effective, leader, remains, strong, among, military, historians, however, the, originality, of, his, achievements, is, debated, as, many, were, based, on, developments, already, underway, he, has, been, studied, as, a, model, of, servant, leadership, in, management, research, and, is, held, in, high, regard, for, his, patronage, of, the, arts, he, has, been, seen, as, an, exemplar, of, enlightened, absolutism, though, this, label, has, been, questioned, in, the, 21st, century, as, many, enlightenment, principles, directly, contrast, with, his, military, reputation, selected, works, in, english, collections, editions, of, music
