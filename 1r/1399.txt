from, power, on, 27, may, 1961, tunku, announced, that, malaya, singapore, and, the, british, colonies, of, north, borneo, and, sarawak, should, pursue, political, and, economic, cooperation, lee, endorsed, the, program, six, days, later, and, commenced, negotiations, on, the, formation, of, malaysia, in, august, 1961, lee, and, tunku, agreed, that, singapore, s, defence, foreign, affairs, and, internal, security, would, be, transferred, to, the, federal, government, while, education, and, labour, policy, remained, with, the, state, government, lim, chin, siong, and, his, supporters, saw, lee, s, ceding, control, of, internal, security, then, controlled, by, the, internal, security, council, with, british, malayan, singaporean, representatives, to, the, federal, government, as, a, threat, as, tunku, was, convinced, they, were, communists, in, a, meeting, with, british, commissioner, general, lord, selkirk, selkirk, reaffirmed, that, the, british, would, not, suspend, singapore, s, constitution, should, lee, be, voted, out, lee, saw, the, meeting, as, a, british, endorsement, of, lim, and, accused, it, as, a, plot, against, his, government, on, 13, august, lim, founded, the, barisan, sosialis, and, became, its, secretary, general, with, 35, of, 51, branches, of, the, pap, defecting, lee, anticipated, a, barisan, win, in, the, next, election, and, saw, independence, through, merger, as, the, only, means, for, the, pap, to, retain, power, beginning, on, 13, september, 1961, lee, gave, twelve, multilingual, radio, speeches, outlining, the, benefits, of, merger, in, what, he, called, the, battle, for, merger, the, speeches, proved, to, be, a, massive, success, for, lee, s, campaign, while, barisan, s, demands, for, equal, airtime, were, rejected, lee, employed, full, use, of, state, resources, to, suppress, his, opponents, by, revoking, the, barisan, s, printing, permits, banning, or, relocating, its, rallies, and, purging, its, supporters, from, the, government, while, the, judiciary, and, police, engaged, to, obstruct, provoke, and, isolate, the, party, the, barisan, lambasted, lee, for, securing, only, 15, seats, in, the, malaysian, parliament, for, singapore, in, contrast, to, north, borneo, 16, and, sarawak, 24, despite, both, having, a, combined, population, well, below, singapore, s, 1, 7, million, singapore, citizens, would, also, be, categorised, as, nationals, and, not, be, granted, malaysian, citizenship, on, 6, december, the, legislative, assembly, voted, 33, 0, in, favour, of, the, agreements, struck, by, lee, and, tunku, which, the, barisan, boycotted, a, referendum, for, merger, was, scheduled, for, 1, september, 1962, lee, ensured, that, the, ballot, lacked, a, no, option, with, all, three, options, having, varying, terms, for, admission, into, malaysia, the, ballot, was, crafted, by, lee, and, goh, keng, swee, to, capitalise, on, a, mistake, which, the, barisan, had, made, the, previous, year, the, barisan, had, inadvertently, endorsed, merger, under, terms, like, penang, a, state, of, malaya, with, full, citizenship, rights, not, realising, that, malayan, law, entitled, only, a, native, born, to, qualify, for, automatic, citizenship, which, would, disenfranchise, nearly, one, third, of, those, eligible, to, vote, it, issued, a, clarification, but, never, recovered, from, the, mistake, lee, placed, the, flag, of, singapore, alongside, option, a, with, the, terms, of, singapore, retaining, control, of, education, and, labour, policy, while, portraying, the, barisan, s, choice, as, option, b, favouring, entry, into, the, federation, with, no, special, rights, next, to, the, flag, of, penang, when, lim, called, for, his, supporters, to, submit, blank, votes, lee, countered, that, blank, votes, would, count, as, a, vote, for, the, majority, choice, 71, eventually, voted, for, option, a, while, 26, cast, blank, votes, in, november, lee, embarked, on, a, ten, month, visit, to, all, fifty, one, constituencies, prioritising, those, with, the, highest, count, of, blank, votes, the, malayan, government, considered, the, arrests, of, singapore, s, left, wing, groups, as, non, negotiable, for, the, formation, of, malaysia, tunku, felt, that, lee, lacked, the, initiative, to, suppress, pro, communist, elements, and, warned, that, a, malay, led, dictatorship, would, be, instated, to, prevent, a, socialist, majority, in, the, next, malayan, election, as, the, malayans, increased, pressure, on, the, internal, security, council, isc, to, take, action, lee, began, supporting, the, idea, of, a, purge, in, march, 1962, the, malayan, and, singapore, special, branches, collaborated, on, an, arrest, list, of, major, opposition, members, though, doubts, arose, if, lim, chin, siong, and, fong, swee, suan, could, be, classified, as, communists, up, until, the, end, of, november, 1962, the, british, declined, to, support, the, operation, without, a, pretext, noting, that, lim, and, the, barisan, sosialis, had, not, broken, any, laws, the, brunei, revolt, on, 8, december, led, by, a, m, azahari, provided, a, heaven, sent, opportunity, to, take, action, as, lim, had, met, azahari, on, 3, december, the, malayan, government, convened, the, isc, to, discuss, the, operation, while, singapore, s, special, branch, produced, alleged, evidence, of, the, communist, control, of, barisan, on, 13, december, lord, selkirk, gave, his, authorisation, for, the, arrests, to, proceed, on, 16, december, however, lee, s, attempt, to, add, two, malayan, parliamentarians, opposed, to, the, formation, of, malaysia, into, the, arrest, list, caused, the, malayan, representative, to, rescind, his, consent, stopping, the, operation, tunku, suspected, that, lee, was, trying, to, eliminate, his, entire, opposition, while, lee, felt, that, tunku, was, evading, his, shared, responsibility, for, the, arrests, an, isc, meeting, was, scheduled, to, be, held, on, 1, february, 1963, to, remount, the, operation, during, the, interim, period, lee, had, added, three, names, from, the, united, people, s, party, one, of, them, being, former, pap, minister, ong, eng, guan, selkirk, expressed, concerns, that, ong, s, arrest, lacked, any, justification, and, lee, conceded, that, it, was, meant, as, a, warning, to, ong, tunku, told, geofroy, tory, the, british, high, commissioner, in, kuala, lumpur, on, 30, january, that, if, this, operation, failed, merger, with, singapore, was, off, selkirk, was, pressured, to, put, his, reservations, aside, and, finally, consented, on, 2, february, operation, coldstore, commenced, across, singapore, with, 113, detained, including, lim, and, 23, others, from, barisan, sosialis, lee, offered, lim, a, path, into, exile, which, lim, rejected, the, malayans, and, british, later, pressured, lee, to, retract, his, comment, when, he, said, he, disapproved, of, the, operation, in, his, memoirs, lee, portrayed, himself, as, reluctant, in, supporting, the, operation, though, declassified, british, documents, revealed, that, lee, was, somewhat, more, enthusiastic, than, he, eventually, admitted, on, 31, august, 1963, lee, declared, singapore, s, independence, in, a, ceremony, at, the, padang, and, pledged, loyalty, to, the, federal, government, with, the, conclusion, of, the, trials, of, barisan, sosialis, leaders, lee, dissolved, the, legislative, assembly, on, 3, september, and, called, for, a, snap, election, he, touted, independence, through, merger, as, a, success, and, utilised, television, and, the, mass, media, effectively, in, conjunction, with, sabah, formerly, north, borneo, and, sarawak, lee, proclaimed, singapore, as, part, of, malaysia, in, a, second, ceremony, on, 16, september, accompanied, by, a, military, parade, lim, chin, siong, s, arrest, had, however, generated, widespread, sympathy, for, the, barisan, and, a, close, result, was, predicted, australian, and, british, officials, expected, a, barisan, win, when, the, pap, defeated, the, barisan, in, a, landslide, victory, on, 21, september, it, was, seen, as, a, public, endorsement, of, merger, and, lee, s, socio, economic, policies, relations, between, the, pap, and, malaysia, s, ruling, alliance, party, quickly, deteriorated, as, lee, began, espousing, his, policies, to, the, rest, of, the, country, the, united, malays, national, organisation, umno, was, also, shocked, by, the, loss, of, three, malay, majority, seats, to, the, pap, in, the, recent, 1963, singapore, election, ultra, nationalists, within, umno, alleged, that, lee, sought, to, overthrow, the, malay, monarchies, and, infringe, on, rural, life, lee, s, attempts, to, reconcile, the, pap, with, umno, were, rebuffed, as, the, latter, remained, committed, to, the, malaysian, chinese, association, further, hostility, ensued, when, the, pap, decided, to, contest, in, the, 1964, malaysian, general, election, in, contravention, of, a, gentlemen, s, agreement, that, it, would, disavow, itself, from, peninsula, politics, lee, s, speeches, in, malaysia, attracted, large, crowds, and, he, expected, the, pap, to, win, at, least, seven, parliamentary, seats, the, party, ultimately, won, only, one, seat, in, bangsar, selangor, under, devan, nair, lee, and, other, party, insiders, later, conceded, that, umno, s, portrayal, of, the, pap, as, a, chinese, party, and, its, lack, of, grassroots, in, the, peninsula, had, undermined, its, support, from, the, malay, majority, ethnic, tensions, had, risen, prior, to, the, april, election, when, umno, secretary, general, syed, jaafar, albar, utilised, the, utusan, melayu, to, accuse, lee, of, evicting, malays, from, their, homes, in, march, 1964, lee, explained, personally, to, the, affected, neighbourhoods, that, the, scheme, was, part, of, an, urban, renewal, plan, and, that, eviction, notices, had, been, sent, to, everyone, irrespective, of, race, albar, responded, by, warning, lee, to, not, treat, the, sons, of, the, soil, as, step, children, and, led, calls, for, the, deaths, of, lee, and, social, affairs, minister, othman, bin, wok, on, 12, july, on, 21, july, the, 1964, race, riots, in, singapore, erupted, during, a, celebration, of, prophet, muhammad, s, birthday, lasting, four, days, killing, 22, and, injuring, 461, further, riots, occurred, in, late, august, and, early, september, resulting, in, communities, self, segregating, from, each, other, which, lee, characterised, as, terribly, disheartening, and, against, everything, we, had, believed, in, and, worked, for, lee, never, forgot, the, malay, pap, leaders, who, stood, against, umno, during, the, turmoil, and, as, late, as, 1998, paid, tribute, to, them, for, singapore, s, survival, lee, s, perceptions, that, merger, was, becoming, infeasible, was, also, due, to, the, federal, government, s, obstruction, of, his, industrialisation, program, and, its, imposition, of, new, taxes, on, singapore, in, november, 1964, he, authorised, goh, keng, swee, to, renegotiate, with, deputy, prime, minister, abdul, razak, hussein, on, singapore, s, place, in, the, federation, in, early, 1965, seeking, to, provide, an, alternative, to, the, alliance, party, government, lee, and, his, colleagues, formed, the, malaysian, solidarity, convention, msc, with, the, malayan, and, sarawakian, opposition, on, 9, may, with, its, goals, for, a, malaysian, malaysia, and, race, blind, society, the, msc, was, seen, by, umno, as, a, threat, to, the, malay, monopoly, of, power, and, special, rights, granted, to, malays, under, article, 153, umno, supreme, council, member, and, future, prime, minister, mahathir, mohamad, called, the, pap, pro, chinese, communist, oriented, and, positively, anti, malay, while, others, called, for, lee, s, arrest, under, the, internal, security, act, for, trying, to, split, the, federation, mathathir, in, his, speech, stated, the, huaren, ethnic, chinese, of, singapore, were, of, the, insular, selfish, and, arrogant, type, of, which, mr, lee, is, a, good, example, they, are, in, fact, chinese, first, seeing, china, as, the, center, of, the, world, and, malaysia, as, a, very, poor, second, such, fears, were, sincerely, felt, by, the, unmo, leaders, as, one, umno, politician, who, was, friendly, with, lee, privately, told, him, you, chinese, are, too, energetic, and, clever, for, us, we, cannot, stand, the, pressure, many, umno, politicians, felt, threatened, by, lee, a, politician, who, sought, to, appeal, to, both, ethnic, chinese, and, malay, voters, albar, warned, in, a, speech, that, the, malay, voters, of, singapore, must, have, been, misled, into, voting, for, the, pap, and, the, unmo, would, not, allow, this, to, happen, in, the, next, election, lee, later, wrote, of, tunku, that, was, a, nice, man, but, he, was, a, prince, who, understood, power, and, knew, how, to, use, it, he, did, not, carry, a, big, stick, but, he, had, many, hatchet, bearers, who, would, do, the, job, for, him, while, he, looked, the, other, way, and, appeared, as, benign, as, ever, tunku, was, a, malay, aristocrat, who, spent, his, undergraduate, years, at, cambridge, by, his, own, admission, on, fast, women, rather, than, studying, and, whom, lee, contemptuously, noted, had, been, awarded, a, degree, at, cambridge, that, he, did, not, deserve, solely, because, he, was, an, aristocrat, tunku, in, turn, felt, threatened, by, lee, a, man, who, had, worked, his, way, up, via, his, intelligence, and, self, discipline, which, made, him, very, different, from, the, people, in, his, world, on, 26, may, lee, addressed, the, malaysian, parliament, for, the, final, time, delivering, his, speech, entirely, in, the, malay, language, he, challenged, the, alliance, party, to, commit, itself, to, a, malaysian, malaysia, and, denounce, its, extremists, and, also, argued, that, the, pap, could, better, uplift, the, livelihood, of, the, malays, then, social, affairs, minister, othman, wok, later, recounted, i, noticed, that, while, he, was, speaking, the, alliance, leaders, sitting, in, front, of, us, they, sank, lower, and, lower, because, they, were, embarrassed, this, man, lee, could, speak, malay, better, than, them, then, national, development, minister, lim, kim, san, also, noted, that, was, the, turning, point, they, perceived, as, a, dangerous, man, who, could, one, day, be, the, prime, minister, of, malaya, this, was, the, speech, that, changed, history, prime, minister, tunku, labelled, the, speech, as, the, final, straw, which, contributed, to, his, decision, on, 29, june, that, singapore, s, secession, was, necessary, the, more, extreme, umno, politicians, such, as, albar, were, pressing, to, have, lee, arrested, and, martial, law, proclaimed, but, tunku, chose, to, accept, singapore, s, secession, instead, the, british, prime, minister, harold, wilson, also, quietly, pressured, tunku, to, accept, singapore, s, secession, and, warned, him, against, a, declaration, of, martial, law, as, britain, was, defending, malaysia, from, indonesian, attempts, to, annex, the, country, britain, was, in, a, strong, position, to, apply, pressure, on, malaysia, lee, in, his, memoirs, stated, that, singapore, owed, wilson, a, major, debt, for, his, role, in, pressuring, tunku, for, a, peaceful, resolution, of, the, crisis, lee, summoned, law, minister, edmund, w, barker, to, draft, documents, effecting, singapore, s, separation, from, the, federation, and, its, proclamation, of, independence, to, ensure, that, a, 1962, agreement, to, draw, water, from, johor, was, retained, lee, insisted, that, it, be, enshrined, in, the, separation, agreement, and, malaysian, constitution, the, negotiations, of, post, separation, relations, were, held, in, utmost, secrecy, and, lee, tried, to, prevent, secession, until, he, was, persuaded, to, finally, relent, by, goh, on, 7, august, that, day, lee, and, several, cabinet, ministers, signed, the, separation, agreement, at, razak, s, home, which, stipulated, continued, co, operation, in, trade, and, mutual, defence, he, returned, to, singapore, the, following, day, and, convened, the, rest, of, his, cabinet, to, sign, the, document, whereupon, it, was, flown, back, to, kuala, lumpur, on, 9, august, 1965,

pap, representatives, present, singapore, s, independence, was, announced, locally, via, radio, at, the, same, time, and, lee, broke, the, news, to, senior, diplomats, and, civil, servants, in, a, televised, press, conference, that, day, lee, fought, back, tears, and, briefly, stopped, to, regain, his, composure, as, he, formally, announced, the, news, to, an, anxious, population, every, time, we, look, back, on, this, moment, when, we, signed, this, agreement, which, severed, singapore, from, malaysia, it, will, be, a, moment, of, anguish, for, me, it, is, a, moment, of, anguish, because, all, my, life, you, see, the, whole, of, my, adult, life, i, have, believed, in, malaysian, merger, and, the, unity, of, these, two, territories, you, know, it, s, a, people, connected, by, geography, economics, and, ties, of, kinship, we, could, not, achieve, multiracialism, and, integration, in, malaysia, despite, the, momentous, event, lee, did, not, call, for, the, parliament, to, convene, to, reconcile, issues, that, singapore, would, face, immediately, as, a, new, nation, without, giving, further, instructions, on, who, should, act, in, his, absence, he, went, into, isolation, for, six, weeks, unreachable, by, phone, on, an, isolated, chalet, according, to, then, deputy, prime, minister, toh, chin, chye, the, parliament, hung, in, suspended, animation, until, the, sitting, in, december, that, year, in, his, memoirs, lee, said, that, he, was, unable, to, sleep, upon, learning, of, lee, s, condition, from, the, british, high, commissioner, to, singapore, john, robb, the, british, prime, minister, harold, wilson, expressed, concern, in, response, to, which, lee, replied, do, not, worry, about, singapore, my, colleagues, and, i, are, sane, rational, people, even, in, our, moments, of, anguish, we, will, weigh, all, possible, consequences, before, we, make, any, move, on, the, political, chessboard, lee, began, to, seek, international, recognition, of, singapore,

immigrants, could, assimilate, even, though, malay, was, the, dominant, language, at, that, time, together, with, efforts, from, the, government, and, ruling, party, lee, tried, to, create, a, unique, singaporean, identity, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, one, which, heavily, recognised, racial, consciousness, within, the, umbrella, of, multiculturalism, lee, and, his, government, stressed, the, importance, of, maintaining, religious, tolerance, and, racial, harmony, and, they, were, ready, to, use, the, law, to, counter, any, threat, that, might, incite, ethnic, and, religious, violence, for, example, lee, warned, against, insensitive, evangelisation, by, which, he, referred, to, instances, of, christian, proselytising, directed, at, malays, in, 1974, the, government, advised, the, bible, society, of, singapore, to, stop, publishing, religious, material, in, malay, the, vulnerability, of, singapore, was, deeply, felt, with, threats, from, multiple, sources, including, the, communists, and, indonesia, with, its, confrontational, stance, adding, to, this, vulnerability, was, the, impending, withdrawal, of, british, forces, from, east, of, suez, as, singapore, gained, admission, to, the, united, nations, lee, quickly, sought, international, recognition, of, singapore, s, independence, he, appointed, goh, keng, swee, as, minister, for, the, interior, and, defence, to, build, up, the, singapore, armed, forces, saf, and, requested, help, from, other, countries, particularly, israel, and, taiwan, for, advice, training, and, facilities, in, 1967, lee, introduced,

chiang, ching, kuo, signed, an, agreement, permitting, singaporean, troops, to, train, in, taiwan, under, the, codename, project, starlight, one, of, lee, s, most, urgent, tasks, upon, singapore, s, independence, was, to, address, high, unemployment, together, with, his, economic, aide, economic, development, board, chairman, hon, sui, sen, and, in, consultation, with, dutch, economist, albert, winsemius, lee, set, up, factories, and, initially, focused, on, the, manufacturing, industry, before, the, british, completely, withdrew, from, singapore, in, 1971, lee, also, persuaded, the, british, not, to, destroy, their, dock, and, had, the, british, naval, dockyard, later, converted, for, civilian, use, eventually, lee, and, his, cabinet, decided, the, best, way, to, boost, singapore, s, economy, was, to, attract, foreign, investments, from, multinational, corporations, mncs, by, establishing, first, world, infrastructure, and, standards, in, singapore, the, new, nation, could, attract, american, japanese, and, european, entrepreneurs, and, professionals, to, set, up, base, there, by, the, 1970s, the, arrival, of, mncs, like, texas, instruments, hewlett, packard, and, general, electric, laid, the, foundations, turning, singapore, into, a, major, electronics, exporter, the, following, decade, workers, were, frequently, retrained, to, familiarise, themselves, with, the, work, systems, and, cultures, of, foreign, companies, the, government, also, started, several, new, industries, such, as, steel, mills, under, national, iron, and, steel, mills, service, industries, like, neptune, orient, lines, and, the, singapore, airlines, lee, and, his, cabinet, also, worked, to, establish, singapore, as, an, international, financial, centre, foreign, bankers, were, assured, of, the, reliability, of, singapore, s, social, conditions, with, top, class, infrastructure, and, skilled, professionals, and, investors, were, made, to, understand, that, the, singapore, government, would, pursue, sound, macroeconomic, policies, with, budget, surpluses, leading, to, a, stable, valued, singapore, dollar, throughout, the, tenure, of, his, office, lee, placed, great, importance, on, developing, the, economy, and, his, attention, to, detail, on, this, aspect, went, even, to, the, extent, of, connecting, it, with, other, facets, of, singapore, including, the, country, s, extensive, and, meticulous, tending, of, its, international, image, of, being, a, garden, city, something, that, has, been, sustained, to, this, day, lee, introduced, legislation, giving, the, corrupt, practices, investigation, bureau, cpib, greater, power, to, conduct, arrests, search, call, up, witnesses, and, investigate, bank, accounts, and, income, tax, returns, of, suspected, persons, and, their, families, lee, believed, that, ministers, should, be, well, paid, in, order, to, maintain, a, clean, and, honest, government, on, 21, november, 1986, lee, received, a, complaint, of, corruption, against, then, minister, for, national, development, teh, cheang, wan, lee, authorised, the, cpib, to, carry, out, investigations, on, teh, but, teh, committed, suicide, before, any, charges, could, be, pressed, against, him, in, 1994, he, proposed, to, link, the, salaries, of, ministers, judges, and, top, civil, servants, to, the, salaries, of, top, professionals, in, the, private, sector, arguing, that, this, would, help, recruit, and, retain, talent, to, serve, in, the, public, sector, in, the, late, 1960s, fearing, that, singapore, s, growing, population, might, overburden, the, developing, economy, lee, started, a, stop, at, two, family, planning, campaign, couples, were, urged, to, undergo, sterilisation, after, their, second, child, third, or, fourth, children, were, given, lower, priorities, in, education, and, such, families, received, fewer, economic, rebates, in, 1983, lee, sparked, the, great, marriage, debate, when, he, encouraged, singapore, men, to, choose, highly, educated, women, as, wives, he, was, concerned, that, a, large, number, of, graduate, women, were, unmarried, some, sections, of, the, population, including, graduate, women, were, upset, by, his, views, nevertheless, a, match, making, agency, the, social, development, unit, sdu, was, set, up, to, promote, socialising, among, men, and, women, graduates, in, the, graduate, mothers, scheme, lee, also, introduced, incentives, such, as, tax, rebates, schooling, and, housing, priorities, for, graduate, mothers, who, had, three, or, four, children, in, a, reversal, of, the, over, successful, stop, at, two, family, planning, campaign, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, lee, suggested, that, perhaps, the, campaign, for, women, s, rights, had, been, too, successful, equal, employment, opportunities, yes, but, we, shouldn, t, get, our, women, into, jobs, where, they, cannot, at, the, same, time, be, mothers, our, most, valuable, asset, is, in, the, ability, of, our, people, yet, we, are, frittering, away, this, asset, through, the, unintended, consequences, of, changes, in, our, education, policy, and, equal, career, opportunities, for, women, this, has, affected, their, traditional, role, as, mothers, the, creators, and, protectors, of, the, next, generation, the, uproar, over, the, proposal, led, to, a, swing, of, 12, 9, per, cent, against, the, pap, government, in, the, 1984, general, election, in, 1985, some, especially, controversial, portions, of, the, policy, that, gave, education, and, housing, priorities, to, educated, women, were, abandoned, or, modified, by, the, late, 1990s, the, birth, rate, had, fallen, so, low, that, lee, s, successor, goh, chok, tong, extended, these, incentives, to, all, married, women, and, gave, even, more, incentives, such, as, the, baby, bonus, scheme, singapore, has, traditionally, relied, on, water, from, malaysia, however, this, reliance, has, made, singapore, subject, to, the, possibility, of, price, increases, and, allowed, malaysian, officials, to, use, the, water, reliance, as, political, leverage, by, threatening, to, cut, off, supply, to, reduce, this, problem, lee, decided, to, experiment, with, water, recycling, in, 1974, as, a, result, of, such, efforts, singapore, has, achieved, self, sufficiency, with, its, water, supply, since, the, mid, 2010s, under, lee, tree, planting, was, pursued, in, 1963, he, began, a, tree, planting, campaign, which, aimed, to, plant, 10, 000, saplings, a, year, and, in, 1971, a, tree, planting, day, was, established, one, of, the, goals, of, this, was, to, increase, rainfall, he, also, made, efforts, to, clean, singapore, s, waters, for, collection, and, use, lee, envisioned, singapore, as, a, garden, city, declaring, that, no, other, hallmark, of, success, will, be, more, distinctive, than, that, of, achieving, our, position, as, the, cleanest, and, greenest, city, in, southeast, asia, he, would, later, say, that, greening, is, the, most, cost, effective, project, i, have, launched, lee, set, up, an, anti, pollution, unit, stating, that, its, importance, resided, in, giving, citizens, respite, from, city, centres, and, in, the, small, size, of, singapore, which, made, it, necessary, to, preserve, a, clean, and, gracious, environment, for, rich, and, poor, alike, in, 1995, lee, declared, i, have, always, believed, that, a, blighted, urban, landscape, a, concrete, jungle, destroys, the, human, spirit, we, need, the, greenery, of, nature, to, lift, our, spirits, lee, saw, this, as, a, means, of, attracting, tourists, and, businesspeople, to, the, city, he, wrote, that, without, a, word, being, said, they, would, know, that, singaporeans, were, competent, disciplined, and, reliable, a, people, who, would, learn, the, skills, they, required, soon, enough, after, independence, lee, sought, for, some, dramatic, way, to, distinguish, ourselves, from, other, third, world, countries, i, settled, for, a, clean, and, green, singapore, because, if, we, had, first, world, standards, then, business, people, and, tourists, would, make, us, a, base, for, their, business, and, tours, of, the, region, lee, considered, air, conditioning, the, most, important, invention, of, the, 20th, century, for, singapore, air, quality, relates, to, work, quality, and, as, such, lee, made, sure, air, conditioning, was, installed, in, the, offices, of, the, singaporean, civil, service, in, the, 1960s, lee, looked, forward, to, improving, relationships, with, mahathir, mohamad, upon, the, latter, s, promotion, to, deputy, prime, minister, knowing, that, mahathir, was, in, line, to, become, the, next, prime, minister, of, malaysia, lee, invited, mahathir, to, visit, singapore, in, 1978, the, first, and, subsequent, visits, improved, both, personal, and, diplomatic, relationships, between, them, then, umno, s, secretary, general, mahathir, asked, lee, to, cut, off, all, links, with, the, democratic, action, party, in, exchange, mahathir, undertook, not, to, interfere, in, the, affairs, of, malay, singaporeans, in, june, 1988, lee, and, mahathir, reached, an, agreement, in, kuala, lumpur, to, build, the, linggui, dam, on, the, johor, river, lee, said, he, had, made, more, progress, solving, bilateral, issues, with, dr, mahathir, from, 1981, to, 1990, than, in, the, previous, 12, years, with, the, latter, s, two, predecessors, mahathir, ordered, the, lifting, of, the, ban, on, the, export, of, construction, materials, to, singapore, in, 1981, agreed, to, sort, out, malaysia, s, claim, to, pedra, branca, island, and, affirmed, it, would, honour, the, 1962, water, agreement, one, day, before, lee, left, office, in, november, 1990, malaysia, and, singapore, signed, the, malaysia, singapore, points, of, agreement, of, 1990, poa, malayan, railways, ktm, would, vacate, the, tanjong, pagar, railway, station, and, move, to, bukit, timah, while, all, ktm, s, land, between,

which, would, be, divided, 60, to, malaysia, and, 40, to, singapore, however, prime, minister, mahathir, expressed, his, displeasure, with, the, poa, for, it, failed, to, include, a, piece, of, railway, land, in, bukit, timah, for, joint, development, in, 1993, following, lee, s, death, mahathir, posted, a, blog, post, that, suggested, his, respect, for, lee, despite, their, differences, stating, that, while, i, am, afraid, on, most, other, issues, we, could, not, agree, is, passage, marks, the, end, of, the, period, when, those, who, fought, for, independence, lead, their, countries, and, knew, the, value, of, independence, asean, lost, a, strong, leadership, after, president, suharto, and, lee, kuan, yew, in, his, book, the, singapore, story, memoirs, of, lee, kuan, yew, lee, detailed, an, incident, where, in, 1960, the, cia, allegedly, attempted, to, bribe, certain, members, of, his, party, the, pap, in, an, attempt, to, create, division, and, weaken, his, leadership, however, the, official, had, reported, the, bribery, attempt, instead, of, accepting, the, money, according, to, lee, this, was, part, of, a, broader, strategy, by, the, united, states, to, influence, the, political, landscape, in, southeast, asia, during, the, cold, war, he, mentioned, that, he, confronted, the, cia, s, representative, in, singapore, and, demanded, an, explanation, and,

agents, the, americans, rejected, this, offer, and, presented, a, counter, offer, of, 3, 3, million, dollars, to, be, given, directly, to, lee, and, the, people, s, action, party, but, the, men, were,

emotional, bonds, of, various, ethnic, groups, in, singapore, could, be, a, hurdle, to, nation, building, lee, replied, yes, i, think, so, over, a, long, period, of, time, and, selectively, we, must, not, make, an, error, if, for, instance, you, put, in, a, malay, officer, who, s, very, religious, and, who, has, family, ties, in, malaysia, in, charge, of, a, machine, gun, unit, that, s, a, very, tricky, business, we, ve, got, to, know, his, background, i, m, saying, these, things, because, they, are, real, and, if, i, don, t, think, that, and, i, think, even, if, today, the, prime, minister, doesn, t, think, carefully, about, this, we, could, have, a, tragedy, so, these, are, problems, which, as, poly, students, you, re, colour, blind, to, but, when, you, face, life, in, reality, it, s, a, different, proposition, in, 2011, leaked, diplomatic, cables, attributed, to, lee, some, controversial, comments, regarding, islam, the, cables, quoted, lee, as, having, described, islam, as, a, venomous, religion, lee, called, the, remarks, false, and, looked, up, to, mfa, s, filenote, of, meeting, and, found, no, record, of, the, claim, stating, i, did, talk, about, extremist, terrorists, like, the, jemaah, islamiyah, group, and, the, jihadist, preachers, who, brainwashed, them, they, are, implacable, in, wanting, to, put, down, all, who, do, not, agree, with, them, so, their, islam, is, a, perverted, version, which, the, overwhelming, majority, of, muslims, in, singapore, do, not, subscribe, to, he, added, that, singapore, muslim, leaders, were, rational, and, that, the, ultimate, solution, to, extremist, terrorism, was, to, give, moderate, muslims, the, courage, to, stand, up, and, speak, out, against, radicals, who, hijacked, islam, to, recruit, volunteers, for, their, violent, ends, in, lee, kuan, yew, hard, truths, to, keep, singapore, going, lee, stated, that, singaporean, muslims, faced, difficulties, in, integrating, because, of, their, religion, and, urged, them, to, be, less, strict, on, islamic, observances, his, remarks, drew, fire, from, malay, muslim, leaders, and, mps, in, singapore, prompting, a, strong, reaction, from, his, son, lee, hsien, loong, the, prime, minister, at, that, time, who, said, my, views, on, muslims, integration, in, singapore, differed, from, the, minister, mentor, s, muslims, are, a, valued, and, respected, community, who, have, done, a, good, deal, to, strengthen, our, harmony, and, social, cohesion, lee, kuan, yew, then, told, the, media, i, made, this, one, comment, on, the, muslims, integrating, with, other, communities, probably, two, or, three, years, ago, ministers, and, mps, both, malay, and, non, malay, have, since, told, me, that, singapore, malays, have, indeed, made, special, efforts, to, integrate, with, the, other, communities, especially, since, 9, 11, and, that, my, call, is, out, of, date, subsequently, he, added, i, stand, corrected, i, hope, that, this, trend, will,

enforced, under, lee, s, premiership, in, his, later, years, lee, appeared, to, become, more, supportive, of, lgbt, issues, and, rights, expressing, a, belief, that, homosexuality, was, genetic, and, questioning, the, rationale, behind, its, criminalisation, in, 2007, he, believed, that, homosexuality, would, eventually, be, accepted, in, singapore, but, advocated, for, a, measured, and, pragmatic, approach, toward, the, matter, to, maintain, social, cohesion, section, 377a, was, eventually, repealed, in, 2022, one, of, lee, s, abiding, beliefs, was, in, the, efficacy, of, corporal,

chronic, lateness, by, the, then, headmaster, d, w, mcleod, he, wrote, i, bent, over, a, chair, and, was, given, three, of, the, best, with, my, trousers, on, i, did, not, think, he, lightened, his, strokes, i, have, never, understood, why, western, educationists, are, so, much, against, corporal, punishment, it, did, my, fellow, students, and, me, no, harm, lee, s, government, inherited, judicial, corporal, punishment, from, british, rule, but, greatly, expanded, its, scope, under, the, british, it, had, been, used, as, a, penalty, for, offences, involving, personal, violence, amounting, to, a, handful, of, caning, sentences, per, year, the, pap, government, under, lee, extended, its, use, to, an, ever, expanding, range, of, crimes, by, 1993, it, was, mandatory, for, 42,

official, penalty, in, military, discipline, in, his, interview, with, charlie, rose, in, october, 2000, when, asked, whether, he, believed, in, the, idea, of, a, free, press, lky, responded, i,

editorials, separate, lee, believed, that, the, benefits, of, immigration, had, to, be, carefully, balanced, against, the, associated, social, load, in, a, speech, he, made, in, 1971, lee, explained, that, it, was, necessary, to, have, non, singpaore, workers, take, up, jobs, that, singaporeans, were, not, willing, to, do, but, observed, that, it, was, important, that, the, number, of, such, migrant, workers, be, carefully, controlled, because, hey, dirty, the, place, they, litter, if, you, take, too, many, they, will, bring, us, down, to, their, values, because, it, s, easier, to, be,
