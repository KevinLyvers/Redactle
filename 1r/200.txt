major, highways, these, roadways, and, bridges, alongside, urban, renewal, efforts, that, destroyed, huge, swaths, of, tenement, housing, and, replaced, them, with, large, public, housing, projects, transformed, the, physical, fabric, of, new, york, and, inspired, other, cities, to, undertake, similar, development, endeavors, moses, s, reputation, declined, after, the, publication, of, robert, caro, s, pulitzer, prize, winning, biography, the, power, broker, 1974, which, cast, doubt, on, the, purported, benefits, of, many, of, moses, s, projects, and, further, cast, moses, as, racist, in, large, part, because, of, the, power, broker, moses, is, today, considered, a, controversial, figure, in, the, history, of, new, york, city, as, well, as, new, york, state, moses, was, born, in, new, haven, connecticut, on, december, 18, 1888, to, parents, of, german, jewish, descent, bella, silverman, and, emanuel, moses, he, spent, the, first, nine, years, of, his, life, living, at, 83, dwight, street, in, new, haven, two, blocks, from, yale, university, in, 1897, the, moses, family, moved, to, new, york, city, where, they, lived, on, east, 46th, street, off, fifth, avenue, moses, s, father, was, a, successful, department, store, owner, and, real, estate, speculator, in, new, haven, in, order, for, the, family, to, move, to, new, york, city, he, sold, his, real, estate, holdings, and,

elementary, and, secondary, education, including, the, ethical, culture, school, the, dwight, school, and, the, mohegan, lake, school, a, military, academy, near, peekskill, after, graduating, from, yale, college, b, a, 1909, and, wadham, college, oxford, b, a, jurisprudence, 1911, m, a, 1913, and, earning, a, ph, d, in, political, science, from, columbia, university, in, 1914, moses, became, attracted, to, new, york, city, reform, politics, a, committed, idealist, moses, developed, several, plans, to, rid, new, york, of, patronage, hiring, practices, including, authoring, a, 1919, proposal, to, reorganize, the, new, york, state, government, which, was, ultimately, not, adopted, but, drew, the, attention, of, belle, moskowitz, a, friend, and, trusted, advisor, to, governor, al, smith, when, the, state, secretary, of, state, s, position, became, appointive, rather, than, elective, smith, named, moses, he, served, from, 1927, to, 1929, moses, rose, to, power, with, smith, who, was, elected, as, governor, in, 1918, and, then, again, in, 1922, with, smith, s, support, moses, set, in, motion, a, sweeping, consolidation, of, the, new, york, state, government, during, that, period, moses, began, his, first, foray, into, large, scale, public, work, initiatives, while, drawing, on, smith, s, political, power, to, enact, legislation, this, helped, create, the, new, long, island, state, park, commission, and, the, state, council, of, parks, in, 1924, governor, smith, appointed, moses, chairman, of, the, state, council, of, parks, and, president, of, the, long, island, state, park, commission, this, centralization, allowed, smith, to, run, a, government, later, used, as, a, model, for, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, new, deal, federal, government, moses, also, received, numerous, commissions, that, he, carried, out, efficiently, such, as, the, development, of, jones, beach, state, park, displaying, a, strong, command, of, law, as, well, as, matters, of, engineering, moses, became, known, for, his, skill, in, drafting, legislation, and, was, called, the, best, bill, drafter, in, albany, at, a, time, when, the, public, was, accustomed, to, tammany, hall, corruption, and, incompetence, moses, was, seen, as, a, savior, of, government, shortly, after, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, inauguration, in, 1933, the, federal, government, found, itself, with, millions, of, new, deal, dollars, to, spend, yet, states, and, cities, had, few, projects, ready, moses, was, one, of, the, few, local, officials, who, had, projects, shovel, ready, for, that, reason, new, york, city, was, able, to, obtain, significant, works, progress, administration, wpa, civilian, conservation, corps, ccc, and, other, depression, era, funding, one, of, his, most, influential, and, longest, lasting, positions, was, that, of, parks, commissioner, of, new, york, city, a, role, he, served, from, january, 18, 1934, to, may, 23, 1960, the, many, offices, and, professional, titles, that, moses, held, gave, him, unusually, broad, power, to, shape, urban, development, in, the, new, york, metropolitan, region, these, include, according, to, the, new, york, preservation, archive, project, during, the, 1920s, moses, sparred, with, franklin, d, roosevelt, then, head, of, the, taconic, state, park, commission, who, favored, the, prompt, construction, of, a, parkway, through, the, hudson, valley, moses, succeeded, in, diverting, funds, to, his, long, island, parkway, projects, the, northern, state, parkway, the, southern, state, parkway, and, the, wantagh, state, parkway, although, the, taconic, state, parkway, was, later, completed, as, well, moses, helped, build, long, island, s, meadowbrook, state, parkway, it, was, the, first, fully, divided, limited, access, highway, in, the, world, moses, was, a, highly, influential, figure, in, the, initiation, of, many, of, the, reforms, that, restructured, new, york, state, s, government, during, the, 1920s, a, reconstruction, commission, headed, by, moses, produced, a, highly, influential, report, that, provided, recommendations, that, would, largely, be, adopted, including, the, consolidation, of, 187, existing, agencies, under, 18, departments, a, new, executive, budget, system, and, the, four, year, term, limit, for, the, governorship, during, the, depression, moses, along, with, mayor, fiorello, h, la, guardia, was, especially, interested, in, creating, new, pools, and, other, bathing, facilities, such, as, those, in, jacob, riis, park, jones, beach, and, orchard, beach, he, devised, a, list, of, 23, pools, around, the, city, the, pools, would, be, built, using, funds, from, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, a, federal, agency, created, as, part, of, the, new, deal, to, combat, the, depression, s, negative, effects, eleven, of, these, pools, were, to, be, designed, concurrently, and, open, in, 1936, these, comprised, ten, pools, at, astoria, park, betsy, head, park, crotona, park, hamilton, fish, park, highbridge, park, thomas, jefferson, park, mccarren, park, red, hook, park, jackie, robinson, park, and, sunset, park, as, well, as, a, standalone, facility, at, tompkinsville, pool, moses, along, with, architects, aymar, embury, ii, and, gilmore, david, clarke, created, a, common, design, for, these, proposed, aquatic, centers, each, location, was, to, have, distinct, pools, for, diving, swimming, and, wading, bleachers, and, viewing, areas, and, bathhouses, with, locker, rooms, that, could, be, used, as, gymnasiums, the, pools, were, to, have, several, common, features, such, as, a, minimum, 55, yard, 50, m, length, underwater, lighting, heating, filtration, and, low, cost, construction, materials, to, fit, the, requirement, for, cheap, materials, each, building, would, be, built, using, elements, of, the, streamline, moderne, and, classical, architectural, styles, the, buildings, would, also, be, near, comfort, stations, additional, playgrounds, and, spruced, up, landscapes, construction, for, some, of, the, 11, pools, began, in, october, 1934, by, mid, 1936, ten, of, the, eleven, wpa, funded, pools, were, completed, and, were, being, opened, at, a, rate, of, one, per, week, combined, the, facilities, could, accommodate, 66, 000, swimmers, the, eleven, wpa, pools, were, considered, for, new, york, city, landmark, status, in, 1990, ten, of, the, pools, were, designated, as, new, york, city, landmarks, in, 2007, and, 2008, moses, allegedly, fought, to, keep, african, american, swimmers, out, of, his, pools, and, beaches, one, subordinate, remembers, moses, saying, the, pools, should, be, kept, a, few, degrees, colder, allegedly, because, moses, believed, african, americans, did, not, like, cold, water, although, moses, had, power, over, the, construction, of, all, new, york, city, housing, authority, public, housing, projects, and, headed, many, other, entities, it, was, his, chairmanship, of, the, triborough, bridge, authority, that, gave, him, the, most, power, the, triborough, bridge, later, officially, renamed, the, robert, f, kennedy, bridge, opened, in, 1936, connecting, the, bronx, manhattan, and, queens, via, three, separate, spans, language, in, its, authority, s, bond, contracts, and, multi, year, commissioner, appointments, made, it, largely, impervious, to, pressure, from, mayors, and, governors, while, new, york, city, and, new, york, state, were, perpetually, strapped, for, money, the, bridge, s, toll, revenues, amounted, to, tens, of, millions, of, dollars, a, year, the, authority, was, thus, able, to, raise, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, by, selling, bonds, a, method, also, used, by, the, port, authority, of, new, york, and, new, jersey, to, fund, large, public, construction, projects, toll, revenues, rose, quickly, as, traffic, on, the, bridges, exceeded, all, projections, rather, than, pay, off, the, bonds, moses, used, the, revenue, to, build, other, toll, projects, a, cycle, that, would, feed, on, itself, in, the, late, 1930s, a, municipal, controversy, raged, over, whether, an, additional, vehicular, link, between, brooklyn, and, lower, manhattan, should, be, built, as, a, bridge, or, a, tunnel, bridges, can, be, wider, and, cheaper, to, build, but, taller, and, longer, bridges, use, more, ramp, space, at, landfall, than, tunnels, do, a, brooklyn, battery, bridge, would, have, decimated, battery, park, and, physically, encroached, on, the, financial, district, and, for, this, reason, the, bridge, was, opposed, by, the, regional, plan, association, historical, preservationists, wall, street, financial, interests, property, owners, various, high, society, people, construction, unions, the, manhattan, borough, president, mayor, fiorello, laguardia, and, governor, herbert, h, lehman, despite, this, moses, favored, a, bridge, which, could, both, carry, more, automobile, traffic, and, serve, as, a, higher, visibility, monument, than, a, tunnel, laguardia, and, lehman, as, usual, had, little, money, to, spend, in, part, due, to, the, great, depression, while, the, federal, government, was, running, low, on, funds, after, recently, spending, 105, million, 1, 8, billion, in, 2016, on, the, queens, midtown, tunnel, and, other, city, projects, and, refused, to, provide, any, additional, funds, to, new, york, awash, in, funds, from, triborough, bridge, tolls, moses, deemed, that, money, could, only, be, spent, on, a, bridge, he, also, clashed, with, the, chief, engineer, of, the, project, ole, singstad, who, preferred, a, tunnel, instead, of, a, bridge, only, a, lack, of, a, key, federal, approval, thwarted, the, bridge, project, president, roosevelt, ordered, the, war, department, to, assert, that, bombing, a, bridge, in, that, location, would, block, east, river, access, to, the, brooklyn, navy, yard, upstream, thwarted, moses, dismantled, the, new, york, aquarium, on, castle, clinton, and, moved, it, to, coney, island, in, brooklyn, where, it, grew, much, bigger, this, was, in, apparent, retaliation, based, on, specious, claims, that, the, proposed, tunnel, would, undermine, castle, clinton, s, foundation, he, also, attempted, to, raze, castle, clinton, itself, the, historic, fort, surviving, only, after, being, transferred, to, the, federal, government, moses, now, had, no, other, option, for, a, trans, river, crossing, than, to, build, a, tunnel, he, commissioned, the, brooklyn, battery, tunnel, now, officially, the, hugh, l, carey, tunnel, a, tunnel, connecting, brooklyn, to, lower, manhattan, a, 1941, publication, from, the, triborough, bridge, and, tunnel, authority, claimed, that, the, government, had, forced, them, to, build, a, tunnel, at, twice, the, cost, twice, the, operating, fees, twice, the, difficulty, to, engineer, and, half, the, traffic, although, engineering, studies, did, not, support, these, conclusions, and, a, tunnel, may, have, held, many, of, the, advantages, moses, publicly, tried, to, attach, to, the, bridge, option, this, had, not, been, the, first, time, moses, pressed, for, a, bridge, over, a, tunnel, he, had, tried, to, upstage, the, tunnel, authority, when, the, queens, midtown, tunnel, was, being, planned, he, had, raised, the, same, arguments, which, failed, due, to, their, lack, of, political, support, moses, s, power, increased, after, world, war, ii, after, mayor, laguardia, retired, and, a, series, of, successors, consented, to, almost, all, of, his, proposals, named, city, construction, coordinator, in, 1946, by, mayor, william, o, dwyer, moses, became, new, york, city, s, de, facto, representative, in, washington, moses, was, also, given, powers, over, public, housing, that, had, eluded, him, under, laguardia, when, o, dwyer, was, forced, to, resign, in, disgrace, and, was, succeeded, by, vincent, r, impellitteri, moses, was, able, to, assume, even, greater, behind, the, scenes, control, over, infrastructure, projects, one, of, moses, s, first, steps, after, impellitteri, took, office, was, halting, the, creation, of, a, citywide, comprehensive, zoning, plan, underway, since, 1938, that, would, have, curtailed, his, nearly, unlimited, power, to, build, within, the, city, and, removed, the, zoning, commissioner, from, power, in, the, process, moses, was, also, empowered, as, the, sole, authority, to, negotiate, in, washington, for, new, york, city, projects, by, 1959, he, had, overseen, construction, of, 28, 000, apartment, units, on, hundreds, of, acres, of, land, in, clearing, the, land, for, high, rises, in, accordance, with, the, towers, in, the, park, concept, which, at, that, time, was, seen, as, innovative, and, beneficial, by, leaving, more, grassy, areas, between, high, rises, moses, sometimes, destroyed, almost, as, many, housing, units, as, he, built, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, robert, moses, was, responsible, for, the, construction, of, the, triborough, marine, parkway, throgs, neck, bronx, whitestone, henry, hudson, and, verrazzano, narrows, bridges, his, other, projects, included, the, brooklyn, queens, expressway, and, staten, island, expressway, together, constituting, most, of, interstate, 278, the, cross, bronx, expressway, many, new, york, state, parkways, and, other, highways, federal, interest, had, shifted, from, parkway, to, freeway, systems, and, the, new, roads, mostly, conformed, to, the, new, vision, lacking, the, landscaping, or, the, commercial, traffic, restrictions, of, the, pre, war, highways, he, was, the, mover, behind, shea, stadium, and, lincoln, center, and, contributed, to, the, united, nations, headquarters, on, november, 25, 1950, governor, thomas, e, dewey, appointed, moses, along, with, former, secretary, of, war, robert, p, patterson, and, former, justice, charles, c, lockwood, as, a, member, of, the, temporary, long, island, railroad, commission, installed, after, the, richmond, hill, train, crash, on, november, 22, 1950, that, claimed, 79, lives, the, commission, recommended, the, state, purchase, and, operation, by, non, profit, public, authority, of, the, railway, service, moses, had, influence, outside, the, new, york, area, as, well, public, officials, in, many, smaller, american, cities, hired, him, to, design, freeway, networks, in, the, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, for, example, portland, oregon, hired, moses, in, 1943, his, plan, included, a, loop, around, the, city, center, with, spurs, running, through, neighborhoods, of, this, plan, only, i, 405, its, links, with, i, 5, and, the, fremont, bridge, were, built, moses, himself, did, not, know, how, to, drive, an, automobile, moses, s, highways, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, were, parkways, curving, landscaped, ribbon, parks, that, were, intended, to, be, pleasures, to, travel, on, as, well, as, lungs, for, the, city, however, post, world, war, ii, economic, expansion, and, notion, of, the, automotive, city, led, to, the, creation, of, freeways, most, notably, in, the, form, of, the, vast, federally, funded, interstate, highway, network, when, the, owner, of, the, brooklyn, dodgers, walter, o, malley, sought, to, replace, the, outdated, and, dilapidated, ebbets, field, he, proposed, building, a, new, stadium, near, the, long, island, rail, road, on, the, corner, of, atlantic, avenue, and, flatbush, avenue, next, to, the, present, day, barclays, center, home, of, the, nba, s, brooklyn, nets, o, malley, urged, moses, to, help, him, secure, the, property, through, eminent, domain, but, moses, refused, having, already, decided, to, build, a, parking, garage, on, the, site, moreover, o, malley, s, proposal, to, have, the, city, acquire, the, property, for, several, times, as, much, as, he, had, originally, said, he, was, willing, to, pay, was, rejected, by, both, pro, and, anti, moses, officials, newspapers, and, the, public, as, an, unacceptable, government, subsidy, of, a, private, business, enterprise, moses, envisioned, new, york, s, newest, stadium, being, built, in, queens, flushing, meadows, on, the, former, and, as, it, turned, out, future, site, of, the, world, s, fair, where, it, would, eventually, host, all, three, of, the, city, s, major, league, teams, of, the, day, o, malley, vehemently, opposed, that, plan, citing, the, team, s, brooklyn, identity, moses, refused, to, budge, and, after, the, 1957, season, the, dodgers, left, for, los, angeles, and, the, new, york, giants, left, for, san, francisco, moses, was, later, able, to, build, the, 55, 000, seat, multi, purpose, shea, stadium, on, the, site, construction, ran, from, october, 1961, to, its, delayed, completion, in, april, 1964, the, stadium, attracted, an, expansion, franchise, the, new, york, mets, who, played, at, shea, until, 2008, when, the, stadium, was, demolished, and, replaced, with, citi, field, the, nfl, s, new, york, jets, also, played, its, home, games, at, shea, from, 1964, until, 1983, after, which, the, team, moved, its, home, games, to, the, meadowlands, sports, complex, in, new, jersey, moses, s, reputation, began, to, fade, during, the, 1960s, around, this, time, moses, s, political, acumen, began, to, fail, him, as, he, unwisely, picked, several, controversial, political, battles, he, could, not, possibly, win, for, example, his, campaign, against, the, free, shakespeare, in, the, park, program, received, much, negative, publicity, and, his, effort, to, destroy, a, shaded, playground, in, central, park, to, make, way, for, a, parking, lot, for, the, expensive, tavern, on, the, green, restaurant, earned, him, many, enemies, among, the, middle, class, voters, of, the, upper, west, side, the, opposition, reached, a, climax, over, the, demolition, of, pennsylvania, station, which, many, attributed, to, the, development, scheme, mentality, cultivated, by, moses, even, though, it, was, the, impoverished, pennsylvania, railroad, that, was, actually, responsible, for, the, demolition, this, casual, destruction, of, one, of, new, york, s, greatest, architectural, landmarks, helped, prompt, many, city, residents, to, turn, against, moses, s, plans, to, build, a, lower, manhattan, expressway, which, would, have, gone, through, greenwich, village, and, what, is, now, soho, this, plan, and, the, mid, manhattan, expressway, both, failed, politically, one, of, his, most, vocal, critics, during, this, time, was, the, urban, activist, jane, jacobs, whose, book, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, was, instrumental, in, turning, opinion, against, moses, s, plans, the, city, government, rejected, the, expressway, in, 1964, moses, s, power, was, further, eroded, by, his, association, with, the, 1964, new, york, world, s, fair, his, projections, for, attendance, of, 70, million, people, for, this, event, proved, wildly, optimistic, and, generous, contracts, for, fair, executives, and, contractors, made, matters, worse, economically, moses, s, repeated, and, forceful, public, denials, of, the, fair, s, considerable, financial, difficulties, in, the, face, of, evidence, to, the, contrary, eventually, provoked, press, and, governmental, investigations, which, found, accounting, irregularities, in, his, organization, of, the, fair, moses, s, reputation, was, now, undermined, by, the, same, personal, character, traits, that, had, worked, in, his, favor, in, the, past, disdain, for, the, opinions, of, others, and, high, handed, attempts, to, get, his, way, in, moments, of, conflict, by, turning, to, the, press, the, fact, that, the, fair, was, not, sanctioned, by, the, bureau, of, international, expositions, bie, the, worldwide, body, supervising, such, events, would, be, devastating, to, the, success, of, the, event, moses, refused, to, accept, bie, requirements, including, a, restriction, against, charging, ground, rents, to, exhibitors, and, the, bie, in, turn, instructed, its, member, nations, not, to, participate, the, united, states, had, already, staged, the, sanctioned, century, 21, exposition, in, seattle, in, 1962, according, to, the, rules, of, the, organization, no, one, nation, could, host, more, than, one, fair, in, a, decade, the, major, european, democracies, as, well, as, canada, australia, and, the, soviet, union, were, all, bie, members, and, they, declined, to, participate, instead, reserving, their, efforts, for, expo, 67, in, montreal, after, the, world, s, fair, debacle, new, york, city, mayor, john, lindsay, along, with, governor, nelson, rockefeller, sought, to, direct, toll, revenues, from, the, triborough, bridge, and, tunnel, authority, s, tbta, bridges, and, tunnels, to, cover, deficits, in, the, city, s, then, financially, ailing, agencies, including, the, subway, system, moses, opposed, this, idea, and, fought, to, prevent, it, lindsay, then, removed, moses, from, his, post, as, the, city, s, chief, advocate, for, federal, highway, money, in, washington, the, legislature, s, vote, to, fold, the, tbta, into, the, newly, created, metropolitan, transportation, authority, mta, could, have, led, to, a, lawsuit, by, the, tbta, bondholders, since, the, bond, contracts, were, written, into, state, law, it, was, unconstitutional, to, impair, existing, contractual, obligations, as, the, bondholders, had, the, right, of, approval, over, such, actions, the, largest, holder, of, tbta, bonds, and, thus, agent, for, all, the, others, was, the, chase, manhattan, bank, headed, then, by, david, rockefeller, the, governor, s, brother, no, suit, was, filed, moses, could, have, directed, tbta, to, go, to, court, against, the, action, but, having, been, promised, a, role, in, the, merged, authority, moses, declined, to, challenge, the, merger, on, march, 1, 1968, the, tbta, was, folded, into, the, mta, and, moses, gave, up, his, post, as, chairman, of, the, tbta, he, eventually, became, a, consultant, to, the, mta, but, its, new, chairman, and, the, governor, froze, him, out, the, promised, role, did, not, materialize, and, for, all, practical, purposes, moses, was, out, of, power, moses, had, thought, he, had, convinced, nelson, rockefeller, of, the, need, for, one, last, great, bridge, project, a, span, crossing, long, island, sound, from, rye, to, oyster, bay, rockefeller, did, not, press, for, the, project, in, the, late, 1960s, through, 1970, fearing, public, backlash, among, suburban, republicans, would, hinder, his, re, election, prospects, a, 1972, study, found, the, bridge, was, fiscally, prudent, and, could, be, environmentally, manageable, according, to, the, comparatively, low, environmental, impact, parameters, of, that, period, but, the, anti, development, sentiment, was, now, insurmountable, and, in, 1973, rockefeller, canceled, plans, for, the, bridge, moses, s, image, suffered, a, further, blow, in, 1974, with, the, publication, of, the, power, broker, a, pulitzer, prize, winning, biography, by, robert, a, caro, caro, s, 1, 200, page, opus, edited, down, from, 2, 000, or, so, pages, showed, moses, generally, in, a, negative, light, essayist, phillip, lopate, writes, that, moses, s, satanic, reputation, with, the, public, can, be, traced, in, the, main, to, caro, s, magnificent, biography, for, example, caro, describes, moses, s, lack, of, sensitivity, in, the, construction, of, the, cross, bronx, expressway, and, how, he, disfavored, public, transit, much, of, moses, s, reputation, is, attributable, to, caro, whose, book, won, both, the, pulitzer, prize, in, biography, in, 1975, and, the, francis, parkman, prize, which, is, awarded, by, the, society, of, american, historians, and, was, named, one, of, the, 100, greatest, non, fiction, books, of, the, twentieth, century, by, the, modern, library, upon, its, publication, moses, denounced, the, biography, in, a, 23, page, statement, to, which, caro, replied, to, defend, his, work, s, integrity, caro, s, depiction, of, moses, s, life, gives, him, full, credit, for, his, early, achievements, showing, for, example, how, he, conceived, and, created, jones, beach, and, the, new, york, state, park, system, but, also, shows, how, moses, s, desire, for, power, came, to, be, more, important, to, him, than, his, earlier, dreams, moses, is, blamed, for, having, destroyed, more, than, a, score, of, neighborhoods, by, building, 13, expressways, across, new, york, city, and, by, building, large, urban, renewal, projects, with, little, regard, for, the, urban, fabric, or, for, human, scale, yet, the, author, is, more, neutral, in, his, central, premise, the, city, would, have, developed, much, differently, without, moses, other, u, s, cities, were, doing, the, same, thing, as, new, york, in, the, 1940s, 1950s, and, 1960s, boston, san, francisco, and, seattle, for, instance, each, built, highways, straight, through, their, downtown, areas, just, as, moses, wished, to, do, in, new, york, the, new, york, city, architectural, intelligentsia, of, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, who, largely, believed, in, such, proponents, of, the, automobile, as, le, corbusier, and, mies, van, der, rohe, had, supported, moses, many, other, cities, like, newark, chicago, and, st, louis, also, built, massive, unattractive, public, housing, projects, caro, also, points, out, that, moses, demonstrated, racist, tendencies, these, allegedly, included, opposing, black, world, war, ii, veterans, to, move, into, a, residential, complex, specifically, designed, for, these, veterans, and, purportedly, trying, to, make, swimming, pool, water, cold, in, order, to, drive, away, potential, african, american, residents, in, white, neighborhoods, people, had, come, to, see, moses, as, a, bully, who, disregarded, public, input, but, until, the, publication, of, caro, s, book, they, had, not, known, many, details, of, his, private, life, for, instance, that, his, older, brother, paul, had, spent, much, of, his, life, in, poverty, moses, was, said, to, have, blocked, paul, an, engineer, from, being, hired, for, any, public, service, jobs, including, major, infrastructure, projects, that, moses, himself, had, spearheaded, paul, whom, caro, interviewed, shortly, before, the, former, s, death, claimed, robert, had, exerted, undue, influence, on, their, mother, to, change, her, will, in, robert, s, favor, shortly, before, her, death, caro, notes, that, paul, was, on, bad, terms, with, their, mother, over, a, long, period, and, she, may, have, changed, the, will, of, her, own, accord, and, implies, that, robert, s, subsequent, treatment, of, paul, may, have, been, legally, justifiable, but, was, morally, questionable, during, the, last, years, of, his, life, moses, concentrated, on, his, lifelong, love, of, swimming, and, was, an, active, member, of, the, colonie, hill, health, club, moses, died, of, heart, disease, on, july, 29, 1981, at, the, age, of, 92, at, good, samaritan, hospital, in, west, islip, new, york, moses, was, of, jewish, origin, and, raised, in, a, secularist, manner, inspired, by, the, ethical, culture, movement, of, the, late, 19th, century, he, was, a, convert, to, christianity, and, was, interred, in, a, crypt, in, an, outdoor, community, mausoleum, in, woodlawn, cemetery, in, the, bronx, new, york, city, following, services, at, st, peter, s, by, the, sea, episcopal, church, in, bay, shore, new, york, various, locations, and, roadways, in, new, york, state, bear, moses, s, name, these, include, two, state, parks, robert, moses, state, park, thousand, islands, in, massena, new, york, and, robert, moses, state, park, long, island, the, robert, moses, causeway, on, long, island, and, the, robert, moses, niagara, power, plant, in, lewiston, new, york, the, niagara, scenic, parkway, in, niagara, falls, new, york, was, originally, named, the, robert, moses, state, parkway, in, his, honor, its, name, was, changed, in, 2016, the, moses, saunders, power, dam, in, massena, new, york, also, bears, his, name, moses, also, has, a, school, named, after, him, in, north, babylon, new, york, on, long, island, there, is, also, a, robert, moses, playground, in, new, york, city, there, are, other, signs, of, the, surviving, appreciation, held, for, him, by, some, circles, of, the, public, a, statue, of, moses, was, erected, next, to, the, village, hall, in, his, long, time, hometown, babylon, village, new, york, during, his, tenure, as, chief, of, the, state, park, system, the, state, s, inventory, of, parks, grew, to, nearly, 2, 600, 000, acres, 1, 100, 000, ha, by, the, time, he, left, office, he, had, built, 658, playgrounds, in, new, york, city, alone, plus, 416, miles, 669, km, of, parkways, and, 13, bridges, the, proportion, of, public, benefit, corporations, is, greater, in, new, york, than, in, any, other, u, s, state, however, making, them, the, prime, mode, of, infrastructure, building, and, maintenance, in, new, york, and, accounting, for, 90, of, the, state, s, debt, moses, s, life, was, most, famously, characterized, in, robert, caro, s, 1974, award, winning, biography, the, power, broker, the, book, highlighted, his, practice, of, starting, large, projects, well, beyond, any, funding, approved, by, the, new, york, state, legislature, with, the, knowledge, that, it, would, eventually, have, to, pay, for, the, rest, to, avoid, looking, as, having, failed, to, review, the, project, properly, a, tactic, known, as, fait, accompli, he, was, also, characterized, as, using, his, political, power, to, benefit, cronies, including, a, case, in, which, he, secretly, shifted, the, planned, route, of, the, northern, state, parkway, large, distances, to, avoid, impinging, on, the, estates, of, the, rich, but, told, owners, of, the, family, farms, who, lost, land, and, sometimes, their, livelihood, that, it, was, based, on, engineering, considerations, the, book, also, charged, that, moses, libeled, other, officials, who, opposed, him, attempting, to, have, them, removed, from, office, by, calling, some, of, them, communists, during, the, red, scare, the, biography, further, notes, that, moses, fought, against, schools, and, other, public, needs, in, favor, of, his, preference, for, parks, moses, s, critics, charge, that, he, preferred, automobiles, over, people, they, point, out, that, he, displaced, hundreds, of, thousands, of, residents, in, new, york, city, and, destroyed, traditional, neighborhoods, by, building, multiple, expressways, through, them, the, projects, contributed, to, the, ruin, of, the, south, bronx, and, the, amusement, parks, of, coney, island, caused, the, brooklyn, dodgers, and, the, new, york, giants, major, league, baseball, teams, to, relocate, to, los, angeles, and, san, francisco, respectively, and, precipitated, the, decline, of, public, transport, from, disinvestment, and, neglect, his, building, of, expressways, also, hindered, the, proposed, expansion, of, the, new, york, city, subway, from, the, 1930s, to, well, into, the, 1960s, because, the, parkways, and, expressways, that, were, built, replaced, at, least, to, some, extent, the, planned, subway, lines, the, 1968, program, for, action, which, was, never, completed, was, hoped, to, counter, that, other, critics, charge, that, he, precluded, the, use, of, public, transit, which, would, have, allowed, non, car, owners, to, enjoy, the, elaborate, recreation, facilities, he, built, caro, s, the, power, broker, also, accused, moses, of, building, low, bridges, across, his, parkways, in, order, to, make, them, inaccessible, to, public, transit, buses, thereby, restricting, the, use, of, state, parks, by, poor, and, lower, middle, class, families, who, did, not, own, cars, caro, also, wrote, that, moses, attempted, to, discourage, black, people, in, particular, from, visiting, jones, beach, the, centerpiece, of, the, long, island, state, park, system, by, such, measures, as, making, it, difficult, for, black, groups, to, get, permits, to, park, buses, even, if, they, came, anyway, by, other, roads, and, assigning, black, lifeguards, to, distant, less, developed, beaches, instead, while, the, exclusion, of, commercial, vehicles, and, the, use, of, low, bridges, where, appropriate, were, standard, on, earlier, parkways, where, they, had, been, instituted, for, aesthetic, reasons, moses, appears, to, have, made, greater, use, of, low, bridges, which, his, aide, sidney, shapiro, said, was, done, to, make, it, more, difficult, for, future, legislators, to, allow, commercial, vehicles, woolgar, and, cooper, refer, to, the, claim, about, bridges, as, an, urban, legend, moses, vocally, opposed, allowing, black, war, veterans, to, move, into, stuyvesant, town, a, manhattan, residential, development, complex, created, to, house, world, war, ii, veterans, in, response, to, the, biography, moses, defended, his, forced, displacement, of, poor, and, minority, communities, as, an, inevitable, part, of, urban, revitalization, i, raise, my, stein, to, the, builder, who, can, remove, ghettos, without, moving, people, as, i, hail, the, chef, who, can, make, omelets, without, breaking, eggs, additionally, there, were, allegations, that, moses, selectively, chose, locations, for, recreational, facilities, based, on, the, racial, compositions, of, neighborhood, such, as, when, he, selected, sites, for, eleven, pools, that, opened, in, 1936, according, to, one, author, moses, purposely, placed, some, pools, in, neighborhoods, with, mainly, white, populations, to, deter, african, americans, from, using, them, and, other, pools, intended, for, african, americans, such, as, the, one, in, colonial, park, now, jackie, robinson, park, were, placed, in, inconvenient, locations, another, author, wrote, that, of, 255, playgrounds, built, in, the, 1930s, under, moses, s, tenure, two, were, in, largely, black, neighborhoods, caro, wrote, that, close, associates, of, moses, had, claimed, they, could, keep, african, americans, from, using, the, thomas, jefferson, pool, in, then, predominantly, white, east, harlem, by, making, the, water, too, cold, nonetheless, no, other, source, has, corroborated, the, claim, that, heaters, in, any, particular, pool, were, deactivated, or, not, included, in, the, pool, s, design, in, addition, moses, took, a, favorable, view, on, the, british, empire, and, a, racism, much, broader, than, solely, towards, the, african, american, community, speaking, of, empire, as, useful, in, stemming, the, rise, of, the, lesser, breeds, without, the, law, some, scholars, have, attempted, to, rehabilitate, moses, s, reputation, by, contrasting, the, scale, of, works, with, the, high, cost, and, the, slow, speed, of, public, works, in, the, decades, following, his, era, the, peak, of, moses, s, construction, occurred, during, the, economic, duress, of, the, great, depression, and, despite, the, era, s, woes, moses, s, projects, were, completed, in, a, timely, fashion, and, have, been, reliable, public, works, since, then, which, compares, favorably, to, the, delays, that, new, york, city, officials, have, had, in, redeveloping, the, ground, zero, site, of, the, former, world, trade, center, or, to, the, delays, and, technical, problems, surrounding, the, second, avenue, subway, and, boston, s, big, dig, project, three, major, exhibits, in, 2007, prompted, a, reconsideration, of, his, image, among, some, intellectuals, as, they, acknowledged, the, magnitude, of, his, achievements, according, to, the, columbia, university, architectural, historian, hilary, ballon, and, colleagues, moses, deserves, a, better, reputation, they, argue, that, his, legacy, is, more, relevant, than, ever, and, that, people, take, the, parks, playgrounds, and, housing, that, moses, built, now, generally, binding, forces, in, those, areas, for, granted, even, if, the, old, style, new, york, neighborhood, was, of, no, interest, to, moses, himself, moreover, were, it, not, for, moses, s, public, infrastructure, and, his, resolve, to, carve, out, more, space, new, york, might, not, have, been, able, to, recover, from, the, blight, and, flight, of, the, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, to, become, today, s, economic, magnet, every, generation, writes, its, own, history, said, kenneth, t, jackson, a, historian, of, new, york, city, to, the, new, york, times, in, 2007, it, could, be, that, the, power, broker, was, a, reflection, of, its, time, new, york, was, in, trouble, and, had, been, in, decline, for, 15, years, now, for, a, whole, host, of, reasons, new, york, is, entering, a, new, time, a, time, of, optimism, growth, and, revival, that, hasn, t, been, seen, in, half, a, century, and, that, causes, us, to, look, at, our, infrastructure, said, jackson, a, lot, of, big, projects, are, on, the, table, again, and, it, kind, of, suggests, a, moses, era, without, moses, he, added, politicians, are, also, reconsidering, the, moses, legacy, in, a, 2006, speech, to, the, regional, plan, association, on, downstate, transportation, needs, new, york, governor, elect, eliot, spitzer, stated, a, biography, of, moses, written, today, might, be, called, at, least, he, got, it, built, that, s, what, we, need, today, a, real, commitment, to, get, things, done, exhibits, papers, archival, audio, interviews
