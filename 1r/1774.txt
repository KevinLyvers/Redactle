the, wright, brothers, orville, wright, august, 19, 1871, january, 30, 1948, and, wilbur, wright, april, 16, 1867, may, 30, 1912, were, american, aviation, pioneers, generally, credited, with, inventing, building, and, flying, the, world, s, first, successful, airplane, they, made, the, first, controlled, sustained, flight, of, an, engine, powered, heavier, than, air, aircraft, with, the, wright, flyer, on, december, 17, 1903, four, miles, 6, km, south, of, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, at, what, is, now, known, as, kill, devil, hills, in, 1904, the, wright, brothers, developed, the, wright, flyer, ii, which, made, longer, duration, flights, including, the, first, circle, followed, in, 1905, by, the, first, truly, practical, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, wright, flyer, iii, the, brothers, breakthrough, invention, was, their, creation, of, a, three, axis, control, system, which, enabled, the, pilot, to, steer, the, aircraft, effectively, and, to, maintain, its, equilibrium, their, system, of, aircraft, controls, made, fixed, wing, powered, flight, possible, and, remains, standard, on, airplanes, of, all, kinds, 183, their, first, u, s, patent, did, not, claim, invention, of, a, flying, machine, but, rather, a, system, of, aerodynamic, control, that, manipulated, a, flying, machine, s, surfaces, from, the, beginning, of, their, aeronautical, work, wilbur, and, orville, focused, on, developing, a, reliable, method, of, pilot, control, as, the, key, to, solving, the, flying, problem, this, approach, differed, significantly, from, other, experimenters, of, the, time, who, put, more, emphasis, on, developing, powerful, engines, using, a, small, home, built, wind, tunnel, the, wrights, also, collected, more, accurate, data, than, any, before, enabling, them, to, design, more, efficient, wings, and, propellers, 156, 228, the, brothers, gained, the, mechanical, skills, essential, to, their, success, by, working, for, years, in, their, dayton, ohio, based, shop, with, printing, presses, bicycles, motors, and, other, machinery, their, work, with, bicycles, in, particular, influenced, their, belief, that, an, unstable, vehicle, such, as, a, flying, machine, could, be, controlled, and, balanced, with, practice, 169, this, was, a, trend, as, many, other, aviation, pioneers, were, also, dedicated, cyclists, and, involved, in, the, bicycle, business, in, various, ways, from, 1900, until, their, first, powered, flights, in, late, 1903, the, brothers, conducted, extensive, glider, tests, that, also, developed, their, skills, as, pilots, their, shop, mechanic, charles, taylor, became, an, important, part, of, the, team, building, their, first, airplane, engine, in, close, collaboration, with, the, brothers, the, wright, brothers, status, as, inventors, of, the, airplane, has, been, subject, to, numerous, counter, claims, much, controversy, persists, over, the, many, competing, claims, of, early, aviators, edward, roach, historian, for, the, dayton, aviation, heritage, national, historical, park, argues, that, the, wrights, were, excellent, self, taught, engineers, who, could, run, a, small, company, but, did, not, have, the, business, skills, or, temperament, to, dominate, the, growing, aviation, industry, wilbur, and, orville, wright, were, two, of, seven, children, born, to, milton, wright, 1828, 1917, a, clergyman, of, english, and, dutch, ancestry, and, susan, catherine, koerner, 1831, 1889, of, german, and, swiss, ancestry, milton, wright, s, mother, catherine, reeder, was, descended, from, the, progenitor, of, the, vanderbilt, family, one, of, america, s, richest, families, and, the, huguenot, gano, family, of, new, rochelle, new, york, wilbur, and, orville, were, the, 3rd, great, nephews, of, john, gano, the, revolutionary, war, brigade, chaplain, who, allegedly, baptized, president, george, washington, through, john, gano, they, were, 5th, cousins, 1, time, removed, of, billionaire, and, aviator, howard, hughes, wilbur, was, born, near, millville, indiana, in, 1867, orville, in, dayton, ohio, in, 1871, the, brothers, never, married, the, other, wright, siblings, were, reuchlin, 1861, 1920, lorin, 1862, 1939, katharine, 1874, 1929, and, twins, otis, and, ida, born, 1870, died, in, infancy, the, direct, paternal, ancestry, goes, back, to, a, samuel, wright, b, 1606, in, essex, england, who, sailed, to, america, and, settled, in, massachusetts, in, 1636, none, of, the, wright, children, had, middle, names, instead, their, father, tried, hard, to, give, them, distinctive, first, names, wilbur, was, named, for, willbur, fisk, and, orville, for, orville, dewey, both, clergymen, that, milton, wright, admired, they, were, will, and, orv, to, their, friends, and, in, dayton, their, neighbors, knew, them, simply, as, the, bishop, s, kids, or, the, bishop, s, boys, because, of, their, father, s, position, as, a, bishop, in, the, church, of, the, united, brethren, in, christ, he, traveled, often, and, the, wrights, frequently, moved, twelve, times, before, finally, returning, permanently, to, dayton, in, 1884, in, elementary, school, orville, was, given, to, mischief, and, was, once, expelled, in, 1878, when, the, family, lived, in, cedar, rapids, iowa, their, father, brought, home, a, toy, helicopter, for, his, two, younger, sons, the, device, was, based, on, an, invention, of, french, aeronautical, pioneer, alphonse, p, naud, made, of, paper, bamboo, and, cork, with, a, rubber, band, to, twirl, its, rotor, it, was, about, 1, ft, 30, cm, long, wilbur, and, orville, played, with, it, until, it, broke, and, then, built, their, own, in, later, years, they, pointed, to, their, experience, with, the, toy, as, the, spark, of, their, interest, in, flying, 56, 57, both, brothers, attended, high, school, but, did, not, receive, diplomas, the, family, s, abrupt, move, in, 1884, from, richmond, indiana, to, dayton, ohio, where, the, family, had, lived, during, the, 1870s, prevented, wilbur, from, receiving, his, diploma, after, finishing, four, years, of, high, school, the, diploma, was, awarded, posthumously, to, wilbur, on, april, 16, 1994, which, would, have, been, his, 127th, birthday, in, late, 1885, or, early, 1886, while, playing, an, ice, skating, game, with, friends, wilbur, was, struck, in, the, face, by, a, hockey, stick, by, oliver, crook, haugh, who, later, became, a, serial, killer, wilbur, lost, his, front, teeth, he, had, been, vigorous, and, athletic, until, then, and, although, his, injuries, did, not, appear, especially, severe, he, became, withdrawn, he, had, planned, to, attend, yale, instead, he, spent, the, next, few, years, largely, housebound, during, this, time, he, cared, for, his, mother, who, was, terminally, ill, with, tuberculosis, read, extensively, in, his, father, s, library, and, ably, assisted, his, father, during, times, of, controversy, within, the, brethren, church, 164, but, also, expressed, unease, over, his, own, lack, of, ambition, 130, orville, dropped, out, of, high, school, after, his, junior, year, to, start, a, printing, business, in, 1889, having, designed, and, built, his, own, printing, press, with, wilbur, s, help, wilbur, joined, the, print, shop, and, in, march, the, brothers, launched, a, weekly, newspaper, the, west, side, news, subsequent, issues, listed, orville, as, publisher, and, wilbur, as, editor, on, the, masthead, in, april, 1890, they, converted, the, paper, to, a, daily, the, evening, item, but, it, lasted, only, four, months, they, then, focused, on, commercial, printing, one, of, their, clients, was, orville, s, friend, and, classmate, paul, laurence, dunbar, who, rose, to, international, acclaim, as, a, ground, breaking, african, american, poet, and, writer, for, a, brief, period, the, wrights, printed, the, dayton, tattler, a, weekly, newspaper, that, dunbar, edited, capitalizing, on, the, national, bicycle, craze, spurred, by, the, invention, of, the, safety, bicycle, and, its, substantial, advantages, over, the, penny, farthing, design, in, december, 1892, the, brothers, opened, a, repair, and, sales, shop, the, wright, cycle, exchange, later, the, wright, cycle, company, and, in, 1896, began, manufacturing, their, own, brand, they, used, this, endeavor, to, fund, their, growing, interest, in, flight, in, the, early, or, mid, 1890s, they, saw, newspaper, or, magazine, articles, and, probably, photographs, of, the, dramatic, glides, by, otto, lilienthal, in, germany, 1896, brought, three, important, aeronautical, events, in, may, smithsonian, institution, secretary, samuel, langley, successfully, flew, an, unmanned, steam, powered, fixed, wing, model, aircraft, in, mid, year, chicago, engineer, and, aviation, authority, octave, chanute, brought, together, several, men, who, tested, various, types, of, gliders, over, the, sand, dunes, along, the, shore, of, lake, michigan, in, august, lilienthal, was, killed, in, the, plunge, of, his, glider, these, events, lodged, in, the, minds, of, the, brothers, especially, lilienthal, s, death, the, wright, brothers, later, cited, his, death, as, the, point, when, their, serious, interest, in, flight, research, began, wilbur, said, lilienthal, was, without, question, the, greatest, of, the, precursors, and, the, world, owes, to, him, a, great, debt, in, may, 1899, wilbur, wrote, a, letter, to, the, smithsonian, institution, requesting, information, and, publications, about, aeronautics, drawing, on, the, work, of, sir, george, cayley, chanute, lilienthal, leonardo, da, vinci, and, langley, they, began, their, mechanical, aeronautical, experimentation, that, year, the, wright, brothers, always, presented, a, unified, image, to, the, public, sharing, equally, in, the, credit, for, their, invention, biographers, note, that, wilbur, took, the, initiative, in, 1899, 1900, writing, of, my, machine, and, my, plans, before, orville, became, deeply, involved, when, the, first, person, singular, became, the, plural, we, and, our, author, james, tobin, asserts, it, is, impossible, to, imagine, orville, bright, as, he, was, supplying, the, driving, force, that, started, their, work, and, kept, it, going, from, the, back, room, of, a, store, in, ohio, to, conferences, with, capitalists, presidents, and, kings, will, did, that, he, was, the, leader, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, despite, lilienthal, s, fate, the, brothers, favored, his, strategy, to, practice, gliding, in, order, to, master, the, art, of, control, before, attempting, motor, driven, flight, the, death, of, british, aeronaut, percy, pilcher, in, another, hang, gliding, crash, in, october, 1899, only, reinforced, their, opinion, that, a, reliable, method, of, pilot, control, was, the, key, to, successful, and, safe, flight, at, the, outset, of, their, experiments, they, regarded, control, as, the, unsolved, third, part, of, the, flying, problem, the, other, two, parts, wings, and, engines, they, believed, were, already, sufficiently, promising, 166, the, wright, brothers, plan, thus, differed, sharply, from, more, experienced, practitioners, of, the, day, notably, ader, maxim, and, langley, who, all, built, powerful, engines, attached, them, to, airframes, equipped, with, untested, control, devices, and, expected, to, take, to, the, air, with, no, previous, flying, experience, although, agreeing, with, lilienthal, s, idea, of, practice, the, wrights, saw, that, his, method, of, balance, and, control, by, shifting, his, body, weight, was, inadequate, they, were, determined, to, find, something, better, on, the, basis, of, observation, wilbur, concluded, that, birds, changed, the, angle, of, the, ends, of, their, wings, to, make, their, bodies, roll, right, or, left, the, brothers, decided, this, would, also, be, a, good, way, for, a, flying, machine, to, turn, to, bank, or, lean, into, the, turn, just, like, a, bird, and, just, like, a, person, riding, a, bicycle, an, experience, with, which, they, were, thoroughly, familiar, equally, important, they, hoped, this, method, would, enable, recovery, when, the, wind, tilted, the, machine, to, one, side, lateral, balance, they, puzzled, over, how, to, achieve, the, same, effect, with, man, made, wings, and, eventually, discovered, wing, warping, when, wilbur, idly, twisted, a, long, inner, tube, box, at, the, bicycle, shop, other, aeronautical, investigators, regarded, flight, as, if, it, were, not, so, different, from, surface, locomotion, except, the, surface, would, be, elevated, they, thought, in, terms, of, a, ship, s, rudder, for, steering, while, the, flying, machine, remained, essentially, level, in, the, air, as, did, a, train, or, an, automobile, or, a, ship, at, the, surface, the, idea, of, deliberately, leaning, or, rolling, to, one, side, seemed, either, undesirable, or, did, not, enter, their, thinking, 167, 168, some, of, these, other, investigators, including, langley, and, chanute, sought, the, elusive, ideal, of, inherent, stability, believing, the, pilot, of, a, flying, machine, would, not, be, able, to, react, quickly, enough, to, wind, disturbances, to, use, mechanical, controls, effectively, the, wright, brothers, on, the, other, hand, wanted, the, pilot, to, have, absolute, control, 168, 169, for, that, reason, their, early, designs, made, no, concessions, toward, built, in, stability, such, as, dihedral, wings, they, deliberately, designed, their, 1903, first, powered, flyer, with, anhedral, drooping, wings, which, are, inherently, unstable, but, less, susceptible, to, upset, by, gusty, cross, winds, on, july, 27, 1899, the, brothers, put, wing, warping, to, the, test, by, building, and, flying, a, biplane, kite, with, a, 5, foot, 1, 5, m, wingspan, and, a, curved, wing, with, a, 1, foot, 0, 30, m, chord, when, the, wings, were, warped, or, twisted, the, trailing, edge, that, was, warped, down, produced, more, lift, than, the, opposite, wing, causing, a, rolling, motion, the, warping, was, controlled, by, four, lines, between, kite, and, crossed, sticks, held, by, the, kite, flyer, in, return, the, kite, was, under, lateral, control, in, 1900, the, brothers, went, to, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, to, begin, their, manned, gliding, experiments, in, his, reply, to, wilbur, s, first, letter, octave, chanute, had, suggested, the, mid, atlantic, coast, for, its, regular, breezes, and, soft, sandy, landing, surface, wilbur, also, requested, and, examined, u, s, weather, bureau, data, and, decided, on, kitty, hawk, after, receiving, information, from, the, government, meteorologist, stationed, there, kitty, hawk, although, remote, was, closer, to, dayton, than, other, places, chanute, had, suggested, including, california, and, florida, the, spot, also, gave, them, privacy, from, reporters, who, had, turned, the, 1896, chanute, experiments, at, lake, michigan, into, something, of, a, circus, chanute, visited, them, in, camp, each, season, from, 1901, to, 1903, and, saw, gliding, experiments, but, not, the, powered, flights, the, wrights, based, the, design, of, their, kite, and, full, size, gliders, on, work, done, in, the, 1890s, by, other, aviation, pioneers, they, adopted, the, basic, design, of, the, chanute, herring, biplane, hang, glider, double, decker, as, the, wrights, called, it, which, flew, well, in, the, 1896, experiments, near, chicago, and, used, aeronautical, data, on, lift, that, otto, lilienthal, had, published, the, wrights, designed, the, wings, with, camber, a, curvature, of, the, top, surface, the, brothers, did, not, discover, this, principle, but, took, advantage, of, it, the, better, lift, of, a, cambered, surface, compared, to, a, flat, one, was, first, discussed, scientifically, by, sir, george, cayley, lilienthal, whose, work, the, wrights, carefully, studied, used, cambered, wings, in, his, gliders, proving, in, flight, the, advantage, over, flat, surfaces, the, wooden, uprights, between, the, wings, of, the, wright, glider, were, braced, by, wires, in, their, own, version, of, chanute, s, modified, pratt, truss, a, bridge, building, design, he, used, for, his, biplane, glider, initially, built, as, a, triplane, the, wrights, mounted, the, horizontal, elevator, in, front, of, the, wings, rather, than, behind, apparently, believing, this, feature, would, help, to, avoid, or, protect, them, from, a, nosedive, and, crash, like, the, one, that, killed, lilienthal, 73, wilbur, incorrectly, believed, a, tail, was, not, necessary, and, their, first, two, gliders, did, not, have, one, according, to, some, wright, biographers, wilbur, probably, did, all, the, gliding, until, 1902, perhaps, to, exercise, his, authority, as, older, brother, and, to, protect, orville, from, harm, as, he, did, not, want, to, have, to, explain, to, their, father, bishop, wright, if, orville, got, injured, 198, this, airfoil, caused, severe, stability, problems, the, wrights, modified, the, camber, on, site, the, brothers, flew, the, glider, for, only, a, few, days, in, the, early, autumn, of, 1900, at, kitty, hawk, in, the, first, tests, probably, on, october, 3, wilbur, was, aboard, while, the, glider, flew, as, a, kite, not, far, above, the, ground, with, men, below, holding, tether, ropes, 188, 189, most, of, the, kite, tests, were, unpiloted, with, sandbags, or, chains, and, even, a, local, boy, as, ballast, they, tested, wing, warping, using, control, ropes, from, the, ground, the, glider, was, also, tested, unmanned, while, suspended, from, a, small, homemade, tower, wilbur, but, not, orville, made, about, a, dozen, free, glides, on, only, a, single, day, october, 20, for, those, tests, the, brothers, trekked, four, miles, 6, km, south, to, the, kill, devil, hills, a, group, of, sand, dunes, up, to, 100, feet, 30, m, high, where, they, made, camp, in, each, of, the, next, three, years, although, the, glider, s, lift, was, less, than, expected, the, brothers, were, encouraged, because, the, craft, s, front, elevator, worked, well, and, they, had, no, accidents, however, the, small, number, of, free, glides, meant, they, were, not, able, to, give, wing, warping, a, true, test, the, pilot, lay, flat, on, the, lower, wing, as, planned, to, reduce, aerodynamic, drag, as, a, glide, ended, the, pilot, was, supposed, to, lower, himself, to, a, vertical, position, through, an, opening, in, the, wing, and, land, on, his, feet, with, his, arms, wrapped, over, the, framework, within, a, few, glides, however, they, discovered, the, pilot, could, remain, prone, on, the, wing, headfirst, without, undue, danger, when, landing, they, made, all, their, flights, in, that, position, for, the, next, five, years, before, returning, to, kitty, hawk, in, the, summer, of, 1901, wilbur, published, two, articles, the, angle, of, incidence, in, the, aeronautical, journal, and, the, horizontal, position, during, gliding, flight, in, illustrierte, aeronautische, mitteilungen, the, brothers, brought, all, of, the, material, they, thought, was, needed, to, be, self, sufficient, at, kitty, hawk, besides, living, in, tents, once, again, they, built, a, combination, workshop, and, hangar, measuring, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, long, by, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, wide, the, ends, opened, upward, for, easy, glider, access, 129, 130, hoping, to, improve, lift, they, built, the, 1901, glider, with, a, much, larger, wing, area, and, made, dozens, of, flights, in, july, and, august, for, distances, of, 50, to, 400, ft, 15, to, 122, m, the, glider, stalled, a, few, times, but, the, parachute, effect, of, the, forward, elevator, allowed, wilbur, to, make, a, safe, flat, landing, instead, of, a, nose, dive, these, incidents, wedded, the, wrights, even, more, strongly, to, the, canard, design, which, they, did, not, give, up, until, 1910, the, glider, however, delivered, two, major, disappointments, it, produced, only, about, one, third, the, lift, calculated, and, sometimes, pointed, opposite, the, intended, direction, of, a, turn, a, problem, later, known, as, adverse, yaw, when, wilbur, used, the, wing, warping, control, on, the, trip, home, a, deeply, dejected, wilbur, remarked, to, orville, that, man, would, not, fly, in, a, thousand, years, the, poor, lift, of, the, gliders, led, the, wrights, to, question, the, accuracy, of, lilienthal, s, data, as, well, as, the, smeaton, coefficient, of, air, pressure, a, value, which, had, been, in, use, for, over, 100, years, and, was, part, of, the, accepted, equation, for, lift, l, lift, in, pounds, k, coefficient, of, air, pressure, smeaton, coefficient, s, total, area, of, lifting, surface, in, square, feet, v, velocity, headwind, plus, ground, speed, in, miles, per, hour, c, l, coefficient, of, lift, varies, with, wing, shape, the, wrights, used, this, equation, to, calculate, the, amount, of, lift, that, a, wing, would, produce, over, the, years, a, wide, variety, of, values, had, been, measured, for, the, smeaton, coefficient, chanute, identified, up, to, 50, of, them, wilbur, knew, that, langley, for, example, had, used, a, lower, number, than, the, traditional, one, intent, on, confirming, the, correct, smeaton, value, wilbur, performed, his, own, calculations, using, measurements, collected, during, kite, and, free, flights, of, the, 1901, glider, his, results, correctly, showed, that, the, coefficient, was, very, close, to, 0, 0033, similar, to, the, number, langley, used, not, the, traditional, 0, 0054, which, would, significantly, exaggerate, predicted, lift, 220, 221, the, brothers, decided, to, find, out, if, lilienthal, s, data, for, lift, coefficients, were, correct, they, devised, an, experimental, apparatus, which, consisted, of, a, freely, rotating, bicycle, wheel, mounted, horizontally, in, front, of, the, handlebars, of, a, bicycle, the, brothers, took, turns, pedaling, the, bicycle, vigorously, creating, air, flow, over, the, horizontal, wheel, attached, vertically, to, the, wheel, were, an, airfoil, and, a, flat, plate, mounted, 90, away, as, air, passed, by, the, airfoil, the, lift, it, generated, if, unopposed, would, cause, the, wheel, to, rotate, the, flat, plate, was, oriented, so, its, drag, would, push, the, wheel, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, airfoil, the, airfoil, and, flat, plate, were, made, in, specific, sizes, such, that, according, to, lilienthal, s, measurements, the, lift, generated, by, the, airfoil, would, exactly, counterbalance, the, drag, generated, by, the, flat, plate, and, the, wheel, would, not, turn, however, when, the, brothers, tested, the, device, the, wheel, did, turn, the, experiment, confirmed, their, suspicion, that, either, the, standard, smeaton, coefficient, or, lilienthal, s, coefficients, of, lift, and, drag, or, all, of, them, were, in, error, 221, 222, they, then, built, a, six, foot, 1, 8, m, wind, tunnel, in, their, shop, and, between, october, and, december, 1901, conducted, systematic, tests, on, dozens, of, miniature, wings, the, balances, they, devised, and, mounted, inside, the, tunnel, to, hold, the, wings, looked, crude, made, of, bicycle, spokes, and, scrap, metal, but, were, as, critical, to, the, ultimate, success, of, the, wright, brothers, as, were, the, gliders, 225, the, devices, allowed, the, brothers, to, balance, lift, against, drag, and, accurately, calculate, the, performance, of, each, wing, they, could, also, see, which, wings, worked, well, as, they, looked, through, the, viewing, window, in, the, top, of, the, tunnel, the, tests, yielded, a, trove, of, valuable, data, never, before, known, and, showed, that, the, poor, lift, of, the, 1900, and, 1901, gliders, was, entirely, due, to, an, incorrect, smeaton, value, and, that, lilienthal, s, published, data, were, fairly, accurate, for, the, tests, he, had, done, 226, before, the, detailed, wind, tunnel, tests, wilbur, traveled, to, chicago, at, chanute, s, invitation, to, give, a, lecture, to, the, western, society, of, engineers, on, september, 18, 1901, he, presented, a, thorough, report, about, the, 1900, 1901, glider, experiments, and, complemented, his, talk, with, a, lantern, slide, show, of, photographs, wilbur, s, speech, was, the, first, public, account, of, the, brothers, experiments, a, report, was, published, in, the, journal, of, the, society, which, was, then, separately, published, as, an, offprint, titled, some, aeronautical, experiments, in, a, 300, copy, printing, lilienthal, had, made, whirling, arm, tests, on, only, a, few, wing, shapes, and, the, wrights, mistakenly, assumed, the, data, would, apply, to, their, wings, which, had, a, different, shape, the, wrights, took, a, huge, step, forward, and, made, basic, wind, tunnel, tests, on, 200, scale, model, wings, of, many, shapes, and, airfoil, curves, followed, by, detailed, tests, on, 38, of, them, an, important, discovery, was, the, benefit, of, longer, narrower, wings, in, aeronautical, terms, wings, with, a, larger, aspect, ratio, wingspan, divided, by, chord, the, wing, s, front, to, back, dimension, such, shapes, offered, much, better, lift, to, drag, ratio, than, the, stubbier, wings, the, brothers, had, tried, so, far, with, this, knowledge, and, a, more, accurate, smeaton, number, the, wrights, designed, their, 1902, glider, the, wind, tunnel, tests, made, from, october, to, december, 1901, were, described, by, biographer, fred, howard, as, the, most, crucial, and, fruitful, aeronautical, experiments, ever, conducted, in, so, short, a, time, with, so, few, materials, and, at, so, little, expense, in, their, september, 1908, century, magazine, article, the, wrights, explained, the, calculations, on, which, all, flying, machines, had, been, based, were, unreliable, and, every, experiment, was, simply, groping, in, the, dark, we, cast, it, all, aside, and, decided, to, rely, entirely, upon, our, own, investigations, the, 1902, glider, wing, had, a, flatter, airfoil, with, the, camber, reduced, to, a, ratio, of, 1, in, 24, in, contrast, to, the, previous, thicker, wing, the, larger, aspect, ratio, was, achieved, by, increasing, the, wingspan, and, shortening, the, chord, the, glider, also, had, a, new, structural, feature, a, fixed, rear, vertical, rudder, which, the, brothers, hoped, would, eliminate, turning, problems, however, the, 1902, glider, encountered, trouble, in, crosswinds, and, steep, banked, turns, when, it, sometimes, spiraled, into, the, ground, a, phenomenon, the, brothers, called, well, digging, according, to, combs, they, knew, that, when, the, earlier, 1901, glider, banked, it, would, begin, to, slide, sideways, through, the, air, and, if, the, side, motion, was, left, uncorrected, or, took, place, too, quickly, the, glider, would, go, into, an, uncontrolled, pivoting, motion, now, with, vertical, fins, added, to, correct, this, the, glider, again, went, into, a, pivoting, motion, but, in, the, opposite, direction, with, the, nose, swinging, downward, 149, 158, 168, orville, apparently, visualized, that, the, fixed, rudder, resisted, the, effect, of, corrective, wing, warping, when, attempting, to, level, off, from, a, turn, he, wrote, in, his, diary, that, on, the, night, of, october, 2, i, studied, out, a, new, vertical, rudder, the, brothers, then, decided, to, make, the, rear, rudder, movable, to, solve, the, problem, they, hinged, the, rudder, and, connected, it, to, the, pilot, s, warping, cradle, so, a, single, movement, by, the, pilot, simultaneously, controlled, wing, warping, and, rudder, deflection, the, apparatus, made, the, trailing, edge, of, the, rudder, turn, away, from, whichever, end, of, the, wings, had, more, drag, and, lift, due, to, warping, the, opposing, pressure, produced, by, turning, the, rudder, enabled, corrective, wing, warping, to, reliably, restore, level, flight, after, a, turn, or, a, wind, disturbance, furthermore, when, the, glider, banked, into, a, turn, rudder, pressure, overcame, the, effect, of, differential, drag, and, pointed, the, nose, of, the, aircraft, in, the, direction, of, the, turn, eliminating, adverse, yaw, in, short, the, wrights, discovered, the, true, purpose, of, the, movable, vertical, rudder, its, role, was, not, to, change, the, direction, of, flight, as, a, rudder, does, in, sailing, but, rather, to, aim, or, align, the, aircraft, correctly, during, banking, turns, and, when, leveling, off, from, turns, and, wind, disturbances, the, actual, turn, the, change, in, direction, was, done, with, roll, control, using, wing, warping, the, principles, remained, the, same, when, ailerons, superseded, wing, warping, with, their, new, method, the, wrights, achieved, true, control, in, turns, for, the, first, time, on, october, 9, a, major, milestone, from, september, 20, until, the, last, weeks, of, october, they, flew, over, a, thousand, flights, the, longest, duration, was, up, to, 26, seconds, and, the, longest, distance, more, than, 600, feet, 180, m, having, demonstrated, lift, control, and, stability, the, brothers, now, turned, their, focus, to, the, problem, of, power, 161, 171, 175, thus, did, three, axis, control, evolve, wing, warping, for, roll, lateral, motion, forward, elevator, for, pitch, up, and, down, and, rear, rudder, for, yaw, side, to, side, on, march, 23, 1903, the, wrights, applied, for, their, famous, patent, for, a, flying, machine, based, on, their, successful, 1902, glider, some, aviation, historians, believe, that, applying, the, system, of, three, axis, flight, control, on, the, 1902, glider, was, equal, to, or, even, more, significant, than, the, addition, of, power, to, the, 1903, flyer, peter, jakab, of, the, smithsonian, asserts, that, perfection, of, the, 1902, glider, essentially, represents, invention, of, the, airplane, 183, 184, in, addition, to, developing, the, lift, equation, the, brothers, also, developed, the, equation, for, drag, it, is, of, the, same, form, as, the, lift, equation, except, the, coefficient, of, drag, replaces, the, coefficient, of, lift, computing, drag, instead, of, lift, they, used, this, equation, to, answer, the, question, is, there, enough, power, in, the, engine, to, produce, a, thrust, adequate, to, overcome, the, drag, of, the, total, frame, in, the, words, of, combs, the, wrights, then, measured, the, pull, in, pounds, on, various, parts, of, their, aircraft, including, the, pull, on, each, of, the, wings, of, the, biplane, in, level, position, in, known, wind, velocities, they, also, devised, a, formula, for, power, to, weight, ratio, and, propeller, efficiency, that, would, answer, whether, or, not, they, could, supply, to, the, propellers, the, power, necessary, to, deliver, the, thrust, to, maintain, flight, they, even, computed, the, thrust, of, their, propellers, to, within, 1, percent, of, the, thrust, actually, delivered, 181, 186, 367, 375, in, 1903, the, brothers, built, the, powered, wright, flyer, using, their, preferred, material, for, construction, spruce, a, strong, and, lightweight, wood, and, pride, of, the, west, muslin, for, surface, coverings, they, also, designed, and, carved, their, own, wooden, propellers, and, had, a, purpose, built, gasoline, engine, fabricated, in, their, bicycle, shop, they, thought, propeller, design, would, be, a, simple, matter, and, intended, to, adapt, data, from, shipbuilding, however, their, library, research, disclosed, no, established, formulae, for, either, marine, or, air, propellers, and, they, found, themselves, with, no, sure, starting, point, they, discussed, and, argued, the, question, sometimes, heatedly, until, they, concluded, that, an, aeronautical, propeller, is, essentially, a, wing, rotating, in, the, vertical, plane, 242, 243, on, that, basis, they, used, data, from, more, wind, tunnel, tests, to, design, their, propellers, the, finished, blades, were, just, over, eight, feet, long, made, of, three, laminations, of, glued, spruce, the, wrights, decided, on, twin, pusher, propellers, counter, rotating, to, cancel, torque, which, would, act, on, a, greater, quantity, of, air, than, a, single, relatively, slow, propeller, and, not, disturb, airflow, over, the, leading, edge, of, the, wings, wilbur, made, a, march, 1903, entry, in, his, notebook, indicating, the, prototype, propeller, was, 66, efficient, modern, wind, tunnel, tests, on, reproduction, 1903, propellers, show, they, were, more, than, 75, efficient, under, the, conditions, of, the, first, flights, a, remarkable, feat, and, actually, had, a, peak, efficiency, of, 82, the, wrights, wrote, to, several, engine, manufacturers, but, none, could, meet, their, need, for, a, sufficiently, light, weight, powerplant, they, turned, to, their, shop, mechanic, charlie, taylor, who, built, an, engine, in, just, six, weeks, in, close, consultation, with, the, brothers, 245, to, keep, the, weight, down, the, engine, block, was, cast, from, aluminum, a, rare, practice, at, the, time, the, wright, taylor, engine, had, a, primitive, version, of, a, carburetor, and, had, no, fuel, pump, gasoline, was, gravity, fed, from, the, fuel, tank, mounted, on, a, wing, strut, into, a, chamber, next, to, the, cylinders, where, it, was, mixed, with, air, the, fuel, air, mixture, was, then, vaporized, by, heat, from, the, crankcase, forcing, it, into, the, cylinders, the, propeller, drive, chains, resembling, those, of, bicycles, were, supplied, by, a, manufacturer, of, heavy, duty, automobile, chains, the, flyer, cost, less, than, a, thousand, dollars, in, contrast, to, more, than, 50, 000, in, government, funds, given, to, samuel, langley, for, his, man, carrying, great, aerodrome, in, 1903, 1, 000, was, equivalent, to, 34, 000, in, 2023, the, wright, flyer, had, a, wingspan, of, 40, 3, ft, 12, 3, m, weighed, 605, lb, 274, kg, and, had, a, 12, horsepower, 8, 9, kw, 180, lb, 82, kg, engine, on, june, 24, 1903, wilbur, made, a, second, presentation, in, chicago, to, the, western, society, of, engineers, he, gave, details, about, their, 1902, experiments, and, glider, flights, but, avoided, any, mention, of, their, plans, for, powered, flight, 186, 187, in, camp, at, kill, devil, hills, the, wrights, endured, weeks, of, delays, caused, by, broken, propeller, shafts, during, engine, tests, after, the, shafts, were, replaced, requiring, two, trips, back, to, dayton, wilbur, won, a, coin, toss, and, made, a, three, second, flight, attempt, on, december, 14, 1903, stalling, after, takeoff, and, causing, minor, damage, to, the, flyer, because, december, 13, 1903, was, a, sunday, the, brothers, did, not, make, any, attempts, that, day, even, though, the, weather, was, good, so, their, first, powered, test, flight, happened, on, the, 121st, anniversary, of, the, first, hot, air, balloon, test, flight, that, the, montgolfier, brothers, had, made, on, december, 14, 1782, in, a, message, to, their, family, wilbur, referred, to, the, trial, as, having, only, partial, success, stating, the, power, is, ample, and, but, for, a, trifling, error, due, to, lack, of, experience, with, this, machine, and, this, method, of, starting, the, machine, would, undoubtedly, have, flown, beautifully, following, repairs, the, wrights, finally, took, to, the, air, on, december, 17, 1903, making, two, flights, each, from, level, ground, into, a, freezing, headwind, gusting, to, 27, miles, per, hour, 43, km, h, the, first, flight, by, orville, at, 10, 35, am, of, 120, feet, 37, m, in, 12, seconds, at, a, speed, of, only, 6, 8, miles, per, hour, 10, 9, km, h, over, the, ground, was, recorded, in, a, famous, photograph, the, next, two, flights, covered, approximately, 175, and, 200, feet, 53, and, 61, m, by, wilbur, and, orville, respectively, their, altitude, was, about, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, above, the, ground, the, following, is, orville, wright, s, account, of, the, final, flight, of, the, day, wilbur, started, the, fourth, and, last, flight, at, just, about, 12, o, clock, the, first, few, hundred, feet, were, up, and, down, as, before, but, by, the, time, three, hundred, ft, had, been, covered, the, machine, was, under, much, better, control, the, course, for, the, next, four, or, five, hundred, feet, had, but, little, undulation, however, when, out, about, eight, hundred, feet, the, machine, began, pitching, again, and, in, one, of, its, darts, downward, struck, the, ground, the, distance, over, the, ground, was, measured, to, be, 852, feet, the, time, of, the, flight, was, 59, seconds, the, frame, supporting, the, front, rudder, was, badly, broken, but, the, main, part, of, the, machine, was, not, injured, at, all, we, estimated, that, the, machine, could, be, put, in, condition, for, flight, again, in, about, a, day, or, two, five, people, witnessed, the, flights, adam, etheridge, john, t, daniels, who, snapped, the, famous, first, flight, photo, using, orville, s, pre, positioned, camera, and, will, dough, all, of, the, u, s, government, coastal, lifesaving, crew, area, businessman, w, c, brinkley, and, johnny, moore, a, teenaged, boy, who, lived, in, the, area, after, the, men, hauled, the, flyer, back, from, its, fourth, flight, a, powerful, gust, of, wind, flipped, it, over, several, times, despite, the, crew, s, attempt, to, hold, it, down, severely, damaged, the, wright, flyer, never, flew, again, the, brothers, shipped, the, airplane, home, and, years, later, orville, restored, it, lending, it, to, several, u, s, locations, for, display, then, to, the, science, museum, in, london, see, smithsonian, dispute, below, before, it, was, finally, installed, in, 1948, in, the, smithsonian, institution, its, current, residence, the, wrights, sent, a, telegram, about, the, flights, to, their, father, requesting, that, he, inform, press, however, the, dayton, journal, refused, to, publish, the, story, saying, the, flights, were, too, short, to, be, important, meanwhile, against, the, brothers, wishes, a, telegraph, operator, leaked, their, message, to, a, virginia, newspaper, which, concocted, a, highly, inaccurate, news, article, that, was, reprinted, the, next, day, in, several, newspapers, elsewhere, including, dayton, 271, 272, the, wrights, issued, their, own, factual, statement, to, the, press, in, january, 274, nevertheless, the, flights, did, not, create, public, excitement, if, people, even, knew, about, them, and, the, news, soon, faded, in, paris, however, aero, club, of, france, members, already, stimulated, by, chanute, s, reports, of, wright, gliding, successes, took, the, news, more, seriously, and, increased, their, efforts, to, catch, up, to, the, brothers, an, analysis, in, 1985, by, professor, fred, e, c, culick, and, henry, r, jex, demonstrated, that, the, 1903, wright, flyer, was, so, unstable, as, to, be, almost, unmanageable, by, anyone, but, the, wrights, who, had, trained, themselves, in, the, 1902, glider, in, a, recreation, attempt, on, the, event, s, 100th, anniversary, on, december, 17, 2003, kevin, kochersberger, piloting, an, exact, replica, failed, in, his, effort, to, match, the, success, that, the, wright, brothers, had, achieved, with, their, piloting, skill, in, 1904, the, wrights, built, the, wright, flyer, ii, they, decided, to, avoid, the, expense, of, travel, and, bringing, supplies, to, the, outer, banks, and, set, up, an, airfield, at, huffman, prairie, a, cow, pasture, eight, miles, 13, km, northeast, of, dayton, the, wrights, referred, to, the, airfield, as, simms, station, in, their, flying, school, brochure, they, received, permission, to, use, the, field, rent, free, from, owner, and, bank, president, torrance, huffman, they, invited, reporters, to, their, first, flight, attempt, of, the, year, on, may, 23, on, the, condition, that, no, photographs, be, taken, engine, troubles, and, slack, winds, prevented, any, flying, and, they, could, manage, only, a, very, short, hop, a, few, days, later, with, fewer, reporters, present, library, of, congress, historian, fred, howard, noted, some, speculation, that, the, brothers, may, have, intentionally, failed, to, fly, in, order, to, cause, reporters, to, lose, interest, in, their, experiments, whether, that, is, true, is, not, known, but, after, their, poor, showing, local, newspapers, virtually, ignored, them, for, the, next, year, and, a, half, the, wrights, were, glad, to, be, free, from, the, distraction, of, reporters, the, absence, of, newsmen, also, reduced, the, chance, of, competitors, learning, their, methods, after, the, kitty, hawk, powered, flights, the, wrights, made, a, decision, to, begin, withdrawing, from, the, bicycle, business, so, they, could, concentrate, on, creating, and, marketing, a, practical, airplane, 273, 274, this, was, financially, risky, since, they, were, neither, wealthy, nor, government, funded, unlike, other, experimenters, such, as, ader, maxim, langley, and, santos, dumont, the, wright, brothers, did, not, have, the, luxury, of, being, able, to, give, away, their, invention, it, had, to, be, their, livelihood, thus, their, secrecy, intensified, encouraged, by, advice, from, their, patent, attorney, henry, toulmin, not, to, reveal, details, of, their, machine, at, huffman, prairie, lighter, winds, made, takeoffs, harder, and, they, had, to, use, a, longer, starting, rail, than, the, 60, foot, 18, m, rail, used, at, kitty, hawk, the, first, flights, in, 1904, revealed, problems, with, longitudinal, stability, solved, by, adding, ballast, and, lengthening, the, supports, for, the, elevator, 286, during, the, spring, and, summer, they, suffered, many, hard, landings, often, damaging, the, aircraft, and, causing, minor, injuries, on, august, 13, making, an, unassisted, takeoff, wilbur, finally, exceeded, their, best, kitty, hawk, effort, with, a, flight, of, 1, 300, feet, 400, m, they, then, decided, to, use, a, weight, powered, catapult, to, make, takeoffs, easier, and, tried, it, for, the, first, time, on, september, 7, on, september, 20, 1904, wilbur, flew, the, first, complete, circle, in, history, by, a, manned, heavier, than, air, powered, machine, covering, 4, 080, feet, 1, 244, m, in, about, a, minute, and, a, half, their, two, best, flights, were, november, 9, by, wilbur, and, december, 1, by, orville, each, exceeding, five, minutes, and, covering, nearly, three, miles, in, almost, four, circles, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, brothers, had, accumulated, about, 50, minutes, in, the, air, in, 105, flights, over, the, rather, soggy, 85, acres, 34, ha, pasture, which, remarkably, is, virtually, unchanged, today, from, its, original, condition, and, is, now, part, of, dayton, aviation, heritage, national, historical, park, adjacent, to, wright, patterson, air, force, base, the, wrights, scrapped, the, battered, and, much, repaired, aircraft, but, saved, the, engine, and, in, 1905, built, a, new, airplane, the, flyer, iii, nevertheless, at, first, this, flyer, offered, the, same, marginal, performance, as, the, first, two, its, maiden, flight, was, on, june, 23, and, the, first, few, flights, were, no, longer, than, 10, seconds, after, orville, suffered, a, bone, jarring, and, potentially, fatal, crash, on, july, 14, they, rebuilt, the, flyer, with, the, forward, elevator, and, rear, rudder, both, enlarged, and, placed, several, feet, farther, away, from, the, wings, they, also, installed, a, separate, control, for, the, rear, rudder, instead, of, linking, it, to, the, wing, warping, cradle, as, before, each, of, the, three, axes, pitch, roll, and, yaw, now, had, its, own, independent, control, these, modifications, greatly, improved, stability, and, control, enabling, a, series, of, six, dramatic, long, flights, ranging, from, 17, to, 38, minutes, and, 11, to, 24, miles, 18, to, 39, km, around, the, three, quarter, mile, course, over, huffman, prairie, between, september, 26, and, october, 5, wilbur, made, the, last, and, longest, flight, 24, 5, miles, 39, 4, km, in, 38, minutes, and, 3, seconds, ending, with, a, safe, landing, when, the, fuel, ran, out, the, flight, was, seen, by, a, number, of, people, including, several, invited, friends, their, father, milton, and, neighboring, farmers, reporters, showed, up, the, next, day, only, their, second, appearance, at, the, field, since, may, the, previous, year, but, the, brothers, declined, to, fly, the, long, flights, convinced, the, wrights, they, had, achieved, their, goal, of, creating, a, flying, machine, of, practical, utility, which, they, could, offer, to, sell, the, only, photos, of, the, flights, of, 1904, 1905, were, taken, by, the, brothers, a, few, photos, were, damaged, in, the, great, dayton, flood, of, 1913, but, most, survived, intact, in, 1904, ohio, beekeeping, businessman, amos, root, a, technology, enthusiast, saw, a, few, flights, including, the, first, circle, articles, he, wrote, for, his, beekeeping, magazine, were, the, only, published, eyewitness, reports, of, the, huffman, prairie, flights, except, for, the, unimpressive, early, hop, local, newsmen, saw, root, offered, a, report, to, scientific, american, magazine, but, the, editor, turned, it, down, as, a, result, the, news, was, not, widely, known, outside, ohio, and, was, often, met, with, skepticism, the, paris, edition, of, the, herald, tribune, headlined, a, 1906, article, on, the, wrights, flyers, or, liars, in, years, to, come, dayton, newspapers, would, proudly, celebrate, the, hometown, wright, brothers, as, national, heroes, but, the, local, reporters, somehow, missed, one, of, the, most, important, stories, in, history, as, it, was, happening, a, few, miles, from, their, doorstep, j, m, cox, who, published, the, dayton, daily, news, at, that, time, expressed, the, attitude, of, newspapermen, and, the, public, in, those, days, when, he, admitted, years, later, frankly, none, of, us, believed, it, a, few, newspapers, published, articles, about, the, long, flights, but, no, reporters, or, photographers, had, been, there, the, lack, of, splashy, eyewitness, press, coverage, was, a, major, reason, for, disbelief, in, washington, dc, and, europe, and, in, journals, like, scientific, american, whose, editors, doubted, the, alleged, experiments, and, asked, how, u, s, newspapers, alert, as, they, are, allowed, these, sensational, performances, to, escape, their, notice, in, october, 1904, the, brothers, were, visited, by, the, first, of, many, important, europeans, they, would, befriend, in, coming, years, colonel, j, e, capper, later, superintendent, of, the, royal, balloon, factory, capper, and, his, wife, were, visiting, the, united, states, to, investigate, the, aeronautical, exhibits, at, the, st, louis, world, fair, but, had, been, given, a, letter, of, introduction, to, both, chanute, and, the, wrights, by, patrick, alexander, capper, was, very, favorably, impressed, by, the, wrights, who, showed, him, photographs, of, their, aircraft, in, flight, the, wright, brothers, were, certainly, complicit, in, the, lack, of, attention, they, received, fearful, of, competitors, stealing, their, ideas, and, still, without, a, patent, they, flew, on, only, one, more, day, after, october, 5, from, then, on, they, refused, to, fly, anywhere, unless, they, had, a, firm, contract, to, sell, their, aircraft, they, wrote, to, the, u, s, government, then, to, britain, france, and, germany, with, an, offer, to, sell, a, flying, machine, but, were, rebuffed, because, they, insisted, on, a, signed, contract, before, giving, a, demonstration, they, were, unwilling, even, to, show, their, photographs, of, the, airborne, flyer, the, american, military, having, recently, spent, 50, 000, on, the, langley, aerodrome, a, product, of, the, nation, s, foremost, scientist, only, to, see, it, plunge, twice, into, the, potomac, river, like, a, handful, of, mortar, was, particularly, unreceptive, to, the, claims, of, two, unknown, bicycle, makers, from, ohio, thus, doubted, or, scorned, the, wright, brothers, continued, their, work, in, semi, obscurity, while, other, aviation, pioneers, like, santos, dumont, henri, farman, l, on, delagrange, and, american, glenn, curtiss, entered, the, limelight, in, 1906, skeptics, in, the, european, aviation, community, had, converted, the, press, to, an, anti, wright, brothers, stance, european, newspapers, especially, those, in, france, were, openly, derisive, calling, them, bluffeurs, bluffers, ernest, archdeacon, founder, of, the, a, ro, club, de, france, was, publicly, scornful, of, the, brothers, claims, despite, published, reports, specifically, he, wrote, several, articles, and, in, 1906, stated, that, the, french, would, make, the, first, public, demonstration, of, powered, flight, the, paris, edition, of, the, new, york, herald, summed, up, europe, s, opinion, of, the, wright, brothers, in, an, editorial, on, february, 10, 1906, the, wrights, have, flown, or, they, have, not, flown, they, possess, a, machine, or, they, do, not, possess, one, they, are, in, fact, either, fliers, or, liars, it, is, difficult, to, fly, it, s, easy, to, say, we, have, flown, in, 1908, after, the, wrights, first, flights, in, france, archdeacon, publicly, admitted, he, had, done, them, an, injustice, the, brothers, contacted, the, united, states, department, of, war, the, british, war, office, and, a, french, syndicate, on, october, 19, 1905, the, u, s, board, of, ordnance, and, fortification, replied, on, october, 24, 1905, specifying, they, would, take, no, further, action, until, a, machine, is, produced, which, by, actual, operation, is, shown, to, be, able, to, produce, horizontal, flight, and, to, carry, an, operator, in, may, 1908, orville, wrote, 253, a, practical, flyer, having, been, finally, realized, we, spent, the, years, 1906, and, 1907, in, constructing, new, machines, and, in, business, negotiations, it, was, not, till, may, of, this, year, that, experiments, were, resumed, at, kill, devil, hill, north, carolina, the, brothers, turned, their, attention, to, europe, especially, france, where, enthusiasm, for, aviation, ran, high, and, journeyed, there, for, the, first, time, in, 1907, for, face, to, face, talks, with, government, officials, and, businessmen, they, also, met, with, aviation, representatives, in, germany, and, britain, before, traveling, orville, shipped, a, newly, built, model, a, flyer, to, france, in, anticipation, of, demonstration, flights, in, france, wilbur, met, frank, p, lahm, a, lieutenant, in, the, u, s, army, aeronautical, division, writing, to, his, superiors, lahm, smoothed, the, way, for, wilbur, to, give, an, in, person, presentation, to, the, u, s, board, of, ordnance, and, fortification, in, washington, dc, when, he, returned, to, the, u, s, this, time, the, board, was, favorably, impressed, in, contrast, to, its, previous, indifference, with, further, input, from, the, wrights, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, issued, specification, 486, in, december, 1907, inviting, bids, for, construction, of, a, flying, machine, under, military, contract, the, wrights, submitted, their, bid, in, january, and, were, awarded, a, contract, on, february, 8, 1908, then, on, march, 23, 1908, the, brothers, had, a, contract, to, form, the, french, company, la, compagnie, g, n, rale, de, navigation, a, rienne, this, french, syndicate, included, lazare, weiller, henri, deutsch, de, la, meurthe, hart, o, berg, and, charles, ranlett, flint, 255, 256, in, may, they, went, back, to, kitty, hawk, with, their, 1905, flyer, to, practice, for, their, contracted, demonstration, flights, their, privacy, was, lost, when, several, correspondents, arrived, on, the, scene, the, brothers, contracts, required, them, to, fly, with, a, passenger, so, they, modified, the, 1905, flyer, by, installing, two, upright, seats, with, dual, control, levers, charlie, furnas, a, mechanic, from, dayton, became, the, first, fixed, wing, aircraft, passenger, on, separate, flights, with, both, brothers, on, may, 14, 1908, later, wilbur, over, controlled, the, front, elevator, and, crashed, into, the, sand, at, about, 50, miles, per, hour, 80, km, h, he, emerged, with, bruises, and, hurt, ribs, but, the, accident, ended, the, practice, flights, 258, 263, in, october, 1911, orville, wright, returned, to, the, outer, banks, again, to, conduct, safety, and, stabilization, tests, with, a, new, glider, on, october, 24, he, soared, for, 9, minutes, and, 45, seconds, a, record, that, held, for, almost, 10, years, when, gliding, as, a, sport, began, in, the, 1920s, the, brothers, contracts, with, the, u, s, army, and, a, french, syndicate, depended, on, successful, public, flight, demonstrations, that, met, certain, conditions, the, brothers, had, to, divide, their, efforts, wilbur, sailed, for, europe, orville, would, fly, near, washington, dc, facing, much, skepticism, in, the, french, aeronautical, community, and, outright, scorn, by, some, newspapers, that, called, him, a, bluffeur, wilbur, began, official, public, demonstrations, on, august, 8, 1908, at, the, hunaudi, res, horse, racing, track, near, the, town, of, le, mans, france, his, first, flight, lasted, only, 1, minute, 45, seconds, but, his, ability, to, effortlessly, make, banking, turns, and, fly, a, circle, amazed, and, stunned, onlookers, including, several, pioneer, french, aviators, among, them, louis, bl, riot, in, the, following, days, wilbur, made, a, series, of, technically, challenging, flights, including, figure, eights, demonstrating, his, skills, as, a, pilot, and, the, capability, of, his, flying, machine, which, far, surpassed, those, of, all, other, pioneering, aircraft, and, pilots, of, the, day, 368, 369, the, french, public, was, thrilled, by, wilbur, s, feats, and, flocked, to, the, field, by, the, thousands, and, the, wright, brothers, instantly, became, world, famous, former, doubters, issued, apologies, and, effusive, praise, l, a, rophile, editor, georges, besan, on, wrote, that, the, flights, have, completely, dissipated, all, doubts, not, one, of, the, former, detractors, of, the, wrights, dare, question, today, the, previous, experiments, of, the, men, who, were, truly, the, first, to, fly, leading, french, aviation, promoter, ernest, archdeacon, wrote, for, a, long, time, the, wright, brothers, have, been, accused, in, europe, of, bluff, they, are, today, hallowed, in, france, and, i, feel, an, intense, pleasure, to, make, amends, on, october, 7, 1908, edith, berg, the, wife, of, the, brothers, european, business, agent, became, the, first, american, woman, passenger, when, she, flew, with, wilbur, one, of, many, passengers, who, rode, with, him, that, autumn, including, griffith, brewer, and, charles, rolls, 298, 315, wilbur, also, became, acquainted, with, l, on, boll, e, and, his, family, boll, e, was, the, owner, of, an, automobile, factory, where, wilbur, would, assemble, the, flyer, and, where, he, would, be, provided, with, hired, assistance, boll, e, and, his, wife, would, fly, that, autumn, with, wilbur, madame, carlotta, boll, e, had, been, in, the, latter, stages, of, pregnancy, when, wilbur, arrived, in, le, mans, in, june, 1908, to, assemble, the, flyer, she, was, fluent, in, greek, french, and, english, and, translated, the, technical, discussions, between, wright, and, her, husband, wilbur, promised, her, that, he, would, make, his, first, european, flight, the, day, her, baby, was, born, which, he, did, august, 8, 1908, he, became, elizabeth, boll, e, s, godfather, orville, followed, his, brother, s, success, by, demonstrating, another, nearly, identical, flyer, to, the, united, states, army, at, fort, myer, virginia, starting, on, september, 3, 1908, on, september, 9, he, made, the, first, hour, long, flight, lasting, 62, minutes, and, 15, seconds, on, the, same, day, he, took, up, frank, p, lahm, as, a, passenger, and, then, major, george, squier, three, days, later, 295, on, september, 17, army, lieutenant, thomas, selfridge, rode, along, as, his, passenger, serving, as, an, official, observer, a, few, minutes, into, the, flight, at, an, altitude, of, about, 100, feet, 30, m, a, propeller, split, and, shattered, sending, the, flyer, out, of, control, selfridge, suffered, a, fractured, skull, in, the, crash, and, died, that, evening, in, the, nearby, army, hospital, becoming, the, first, airplane, crash, fatality, orville, was, badly, injured, suffering, a, broken, left, leg, and, four, broken, ribs, twelve, years, later, after, he, suffered, increasingly, severe, pains, x, rays, revealed, the, accident, had, also, caused, three, hip, bone, fractures, and, a, dislocated, hip, the, brothers, sister, katharine, a, school, teacher, rushed, from, dayton, to, virginia, and, stayed, by, orville, s, side, for, the, seven, weeks, of, his, hospitalization, she, helped, negotiate, a, one, year, extension, of, the, army, contract, a, friend, visiting, orville, in, the, hospital, asked, has, it, got, your, nerve, nerve, repeated, orville, slightly, puzzled, oh, do, you, mean, will, i, be, afraid, to, fly, again, the, only, thing, i, m, afraid, of, is, that, i, can, t, get, well, soon, enough, to, finish, those, tests, next, year, deeply, shocked, and, upset, by, the, accident, wilbur, determined, to, make, even, more, impressive, flight, demonstrations, in, the, ensuing, days, and, weeks, he, set, new, records, for, altitude, and, duration, on, september, 28, wilbur, won, the, commission, of, aviation, prize, and, then, on, december, 31, the, coupe, michelin, 314, 316, in, january, 1909, orville, and, katharine, joined, him, in, france, and, for, a, time, they, were, the, three, most, famous, people, in, the, world, sought, after, by, royalty, the, rich, reporters, and, the, public, the, kings, of, great, britain, spain, and, italy, came, to, see, wilbur, fly, all, three, wrights, relocated, to, pau, where, wilbur, made, many, more, public, flights, in, nearby, pont, long, wilbur, gave, rides, to, a, procession, of, officers, journalists, and, statesmen, including, his, sister, katharine, on, march, 17, 1909, the, brothers, established, the, world, s, first, flying, school, to, meet, the, french, syndicate, requirements, to, train, three, french, pilots, charles, de, lambert, paul, tissandier, and, paul, nicolas, lucas, girardville, in, april, the, wrights, went, to, rome, where, wilbur, assembled, another, flyer, at, centocelle, wilbur, made, demonstrations, flights, and, trained, three, italian, military, pilots, mario, calderara, umbert, savoia, and, guido, castagneris, a, universal, cameraman, flew, as, a, passenger, and, filmed, the, first, motion, pictures, from, an, airplane, 317, 320, 328, 330, after, their, return, to, the, u, s, on, may, 13, 1909, the, brothers, and, katharine, were, invited, to, the, white, house, where, on, june, 10, president, taft, bestowed, awards, upon, them, dayton, followed, up, with, a, lavish, two, day, homecoming, celebration, on, june, 17, and, 18, on, july, 27, 1909, orville, with, wilbur, assisting, on, the, ground, completed, the, proving, flights, for, the, u, s, army, the, flights, met, the, requirements, that, the, aircraft, carry, two, persons, while, remaining, aloft, for, an, hour, and, achieve, an, average, speed, of, at, least, 40, miles, per, hour, 64, km, h, 330, 341, president, taft, his, cabinet, and, members, of, congress, were, part, of, the, viewing, crowd, of, 10, 000, following, the, successful, flights, the, army, awarded, the, wrights, 25, 000, plus, 2500, for, each, mile, per, hour, they, exceeded, 40, miles, per, hour, orville, and, katharine, then, traveled, to, germany, where, orville, made, demonstration, flights, at, tempelhof, in, september, 1909, including, a, flight, with, the, crown, prince, of, germany, as, a, passenger, 330, 341, on, october, 4, 1909, wilbur, made, a, flight, seen, by, about, a, million, people, in, manhattan, during, the, hudson, fulton, celebration, in, new, york, city, he, took, off, from, governors, island, flew, north, over, the, hudson, river, to, grant, s, tomb, and, returned, to, governors, island, the, aircraft, was, equipped, with, an, unusual, accessory, for, the, flight, a, canoe, attached, to, the, underside, framework, as, a, flotation, device, in, case, of, a, ditching, on, october, 8, in, college, park, maryland, wilbur, began, pilot, training, for, army, officers, frank, p, lahm, and, frederick, e, humphreys, joined, later, that, month, by, benjamin, foulois, 330, 341, on, may, 25, 1910, back, at, huffman, prairie, orville, piloted, two, unique, flights, first, he, took, off, on, a, six, minute, flight, with, wilbur, as, his, passenger, the, only, time, the, wright, brothers, ever, flew, together, they, received, permission, from, their, father, to, make, the, flight, they, had, always, promised, milton, they, would, never, fly, together, to, avoid, the, chance, of, a, double, tragedy, and, to, ensure, one, brother, would, remain, to, continue, their, experiments, next, orville, took, his, 82, year, old, father, on, a, nearly, 7, minute, flight, the, only, powered, aerial, excursion, of, milton, wright, s, life, the, aircraft, rose, to, about, 350, feet, 107, m, while, the, elderly, wright, called, to, his, son, higher, orville, higher, 12, the, wright, brothers, wrote, their, 1903, patent, application, themselves, but, it, was, rejected, in, january, 1904, they, hired, ohio, patent, attorney, henry, toulmin, and, on, may, 22, 1906, they, were, granted, u, s, patent, 821393, for, new, and, useful, improvements, in, flying, machines, the, patent, illustrates, a, non, powered, flying, machine, namely, the, 1902, glider, the, patent, s, importance, lies, in, its, claim, of, a, new, and, useful, method, of, controlling, a, flying, machine, powered, or, not, the, technique, of, wing, warping, is, described, but, the, patent, explicitly, states, that, other, methods, instead, of, wing, warping, could, be, used, for, adjusting, the, outer, portions, of, a, machine, s, wings, to, different, angles, on, the, right, and, left, sides, to, achieve, lateral, roll, control, the, concept, of, varying, the, angle, presented, to, the, air, near, the, wingtips, by, any, suitable, method, is, central, to, the, patent, the, patent, also, describes, the, steerable, rear, vertical, rudder, and, its, innovative, use, in, combination, with, wing, warping, enabling, the, airplane, to, make, a, coordinated, turn, a, technique, that, prevents, hazardous, adverse, yaw, the, problem, wilbur, had, when, trying, to, turn, the, 1901, glider, finally, the, patent, describes, the, forward, elevator, used, for, ascending, and, descending, in, march, 1904, the, wright, brothers, applied, for, french, and, german, patents, the, french, patent, was, granted, on, july, 1, 1904, according, to, combs, regarding, the, u, s, patent, by, 1906, the, drawings, in, the, wright, patents, were, available, to, anyone, who, wanted, badly, enough, to, get, them, and, they, gave, proof, in, vivid, technical, detail, of, how, to, get, into, the, air, 244, 257, 258, glenn, curtiss, and, other, early, aviators, devised, ailerons, to, emulate, lateral, control, described, in, the, patent, and, demonstrated, by, the, wrights, in, their, public, flights, soon, after, the, historic, july, 4, 1908, one, kilometer, flight, by, curtiss, in, the, aea, june, bug, the, wrights, warned, him, not, to, infringe, their, patent, by, profiting, from, flying, or, selling, aircraft, that, used, ailerons, orville, wrote, curtiss, claim, 14, of, our, patent, no, 821, 393, specifically, covers, the, combination, which, we, are, informed, you, are, using, if, it, is, your, desire, to, enter, the, exhibition, business, we, would, be, glad, to, take, up, the, matter, of, a, license, to, operate, under, our, patent, for, that, purpose, 269, 270, curtiss, was, at, the, time, a, member, of, the, aerial, experiment, association, aea, headed, by, alexander, graham, bell, where, in, 1908, he, had, helped, reinvent, wingtip, ailerons, for, their, aerodrome, no, 2, known, as, the, aea, white, wing, curtiss, refused, to, pay, license, fees, to, the, wrights, and, sold, an, airplane, equipped, with, ailerons, to, the, aeronautic, society, of, new, york, in, 1909, the, wrights, filed, a, lawsuit, beginning, a, years, long, legal, conflict, they, also, sued, foreign, aviators, who, flew, at, u, s, exhibitions, including, the, leading, french, aviator, louis, paulhan, the, curtiss, people, derisively, suggested, that, if, someone, jumped, in, the, air, and, waved, his, arms, the, wrights, would, sue, european, companies, which, bought, foreign, patents, the, wrights, had, received, sued, other, manufacturers, in, their, countries, those, lawsuits, were, only, partly, successful, despite, a, pro, wright, ruling, in, france, legal, maneuvering, dragged, on, until, the, patent, expired, in, 1917, a, german, court, ruled, the, patent, invalid, because, of, prior, disclosure, in, speeches, by, wilbur, wright, in, 1901, and, chanute, in, 1903, in, the, u, s, the, wrights, made, an, agreement, with, the, aero, club, of, america, to, license, airshows, which, the, club, approved, freeing, participating, pilots, from, a, legal, threat, promoters, of, approved, shows, paid, fees, to, the, wrights, the, wright, brothers, won, their, initial, case, against, curtiss, in, february, 1913, when, a, judge, ruled, that, ailerons, were, covered, under, the, patent, the, curtiss, company, appealed, the, decision, from, 1910, until, his, death, from, typhoid, fever, in, 1912, wilbur, took, the, leading, role, in, the, patent, struggle, travelling, incessantly, to, consult, with, lawyers, and, testify, in, what, he, felt, was, a, moral, cause, particularly, against, curtiss, who, was, creating, a, large, company, to, manufacture, aircraft, the, wrights, preoccupation, with, the, legal, issue, stifled, their, work, on, new, designs, and, by, 1911, wright, airplanes, were, considered, inferior, to, those, of, european, makers, indeed, aviation, development, in, the, u, s, was, suppressed, to, such, an, extent, that, when, the, u, s, entered, world, war, i, in, april, 1917, no, acceptable, american, designed, airplanes, were, available, and, american, forces, were, compelled, to, use, french, machines, orville, and, katharine, wright, believed, curtiss, was, partly, responsible, for, wilbur, s, premature, death, which, occurred, in, the, wake, of, his, exhausting, travels, and, the, stress, of, the, legal, battle, in, january, 1914, a, u, s, circuit, court, of, appeals, upheld, the, verdict, against, the, curtiss, company, which, continued, to, avoid, penalties, through, legal, tactics, orville, apparently, felt, vindicated, by, the, decision, and, much, to, the, frustration, of, company, executives, he, did, not, push, vigorously, for, further, legal, action, to, ensure, a, manufacturing, monopoly, in, fact, he, was, planning, to, sell, the, company, and, departed, in, 1915, in, 1917, with, world, war, i, underway, the, u, s, government, pressured, the, industry, to, form, a, cross, licensing, organization, the, manufacturers, aircraft, association, to, which, member, companies, paid, a, blanket, fee, for, the, use, of, aviation, patents, including, the, original, and, subsequent, wright, patents, the, patent, war, ended, although, side, issues, lingered, in, the, courts, until, the, 1920s, the, wright, aeronautical, corporation, successor, to, the, wright, martin, company, and, the, curtiss, aeroplane, company, merged, in, 1929, to, form, the, curtiss, wright, corporation, which, remains, in, business, today, producing, high, tech, components, for, the, aerospace, industry, aviation, historian, c, h, gibbs, smith, stated, a, number, of, times, that, the, wrights, legal, victory, would, have, been, doubtful, if, an, 1868, patent, of, a, prior, but, lost, invention, by, m, p, w, boulton, of, the, u, k, had, been, known, in, the, period, 1903, 1906, the, patent, titled, a, rial, locomotion, c, described, several, engine, improvements, and, conceptual, designs, and, included, a, technical, description, and, drawings, of, an, aileron, control, system, and, an, optional, feature, intended, to, function, as, an, autopilot, in, fact, this, patent, was, well, known, to, participants, in, the, wright, curtiss, lawsuit, a, u, s, federal, judge, who, reviewed, previous, inventions, and, patents, and, upheld, the, wright, patent, against, the, curtiss, company, reached, the, opposite, conclusion, of, gibbs, smith, saying, the, boulton, patent, is, not, anticipatory, the, lawsuits, damaged, the, public, image, of, the, wright, brothers, who, were, generally, regarded, before, this, as, heroes, critics, said, the, brothers, were, greedy, and, unfair, and, compared, their, actions, unfavorably, to, european, inventors, who, worked, more, openly, supporters, said, the, brothers, were, protecting, their, interests, and, were, justified, in, expecting, fair, compensation, for, the, years, of, work, leading, to, their, successful, invention, their, 10, year, friendship, with, octave, chanute, already, strained, by, tension, over, how, much, credit, if, any, he, might, deserve, for, their, success, collapsed, after, he, publicly, criticized, their, actions, the, wright, company, was, incorporated, on, november, 22, 1909, the, brothers, sold, their, patents, to, the, company, for, 100, 000, and, also, received, one, third, of, the, shares, in, a, million, dollar, stock, issue, and, a, 10, percent, royalty, on, every, airplane, sold, 410, with, wilbur, as, president, and, orville, as, vice, president, the, company, set, up, a, factory, in, dayton, and, a, flying, school, test, flight, field, at, huffman, prairie, the, headquarters, office, was, in, new, york, city, in, mid, 1910, the, wrights, changed, the, design, of, the, wright, flyer, moving, the, horizontal, elevator, from, the, front, to, the, back, and, adding, wheels, although, keeping, the, skids, as, part, of, the, undercarriage, unit, it, had, become, apparent, by, then, that, a, rear, elevator, would, make, an, airplane, easier, to, control, especially, as, higher, speeds, grew, more, common, the, new, version, was, designated, the, model, b, although, the, original, canard, design, was, never, referred, to, as, the, model, a, by, the, wrights, however, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, which, bought, the, airplane, did, call, it, wright, type, a, there, were, not, many, customers, for, airplanes, so, in, the, spring, of, 1910, the, wrights, hired, and, trained, a, team, of, salaried, exhibition, pilots, to, show, off, their, machines, and, win, prize, money, for, the, company, despite, wilbur, s, disdain, for, what, he, called, the, mountebank, business, the, team, debuted, at, the, indianapolis, speedway, on, june, 13, before, the, year, was, over, pilots, ralph, johnstone, and, arch, hoxsey, died, in, air, show, crashes, and, in, november, 1911, the, brothers, disbanded, the, team, on, which, nine, men, had, served, four, other, former, team, members, died, in, crashes, afterward, chapter, 31, the, mountebank, game, the, wright, company, transported, the, first, known, commercial, air, cargo, on, november, 7, 1910, by, flying, two, bolts, of, dress, silk, 65, miles, 105, km, from, dayton, to, columbus, ohio, for, the, morehouse, martens, department, store, which, paid, a, 5, 000, fee, company, pilot, phil, parmelee, made, the, flight, which, was, more, an, exercise, in, advertising, than, a, simple, delivery, in, an, hour, and, six, minutes, with, the, cargo, strapped, in, the, passenger, s, seat, the, silk, was, cut, into, small, pieces, and, sold, as, souvenirs, in, 1910, the, wrights, advertised, for, a, person, to, undertake, plane, sewing, which, was, corrected, by, the, dayton, newspaper, that, published, it, to, plain, sewing, ida, holdgreve, a, dress, maker, applied, for, the, role, and, became, head, seamstress, at, the, wright, company, factory, sewing, the, fabric, for, the, wings, stabilizers, rudders, fins, and, i, don, t, know, what, all, of, the, planes, produced, there, she, was, trained, in, how, to, cut, and, sew, the, fabric, to, stretch, it, tight, over, the, frame, so, it, wouldn, t, rip, by, duval, la, chapelle, who, was, wilbur, s, mechanic, in, france, between, 1910, and, 1916, the, wright, brothers, flying, school, at, huffman, prairie, trained, 115, pilots, who, were, instructed, by, orville, and, his, assistants, several, trainees, became, famous, including, henry, hap, arnold, who, rose, to, five, star, general, commanded, u, s, army, air, forces, in, world, war, ii, and, became, the, first, head, of, the, u, s, air, force, calbraith, perry, rodgers, who, made, the, first, coast, to, coast, flight, in, 1911, with, many, stops, and, crashes, in, a, wright, model, ex, named, the, vin, fiz, after, the, sponsor, s, grape, soft, drink, and, eddie, stinson, founder, of, the, stinson, aircraft, company, in, 1912, 1913, a, series, of, fatal, crashes, of, wright, airplanes, bought, by, the, u, s, army, called, into, question, their, safety, and, design, the, death, toll, reached, 11, by, 1913, half, of, them, in, the, wright, model, c, all, six, model, c, army, airplanes, crashed, they, had, a, tendency, to, nose, dive, but, orville, insisted, that, stalls, were, caused, by, pilot, error, 459, he, cooperated, with, the, army, to, equip, the, airplanes, with, a, rudimentary, flight, indicator, to, help, the, pilot, avoid, climbing, too, steeply, a, government, investigation, said, the, wright, model, c, was, dynamically, unsuited, for, flying, and, the, american, military, ended, its, use, of, airplanes, with, pusher, type, propellers, including, models, made, by, both, the, wright, and, curtiss, companies, in, which, the, engine, was, located, behind, the, pilot, and, likely, to, crush, him, in, a, crash, orville, resisted, the, switch, to, manufacturing, tractor, type, propeller, aircraft, worried, that, a, design, change, could, threaten, the, wright, patent, infringement, case, against, curtiss, 457, s, p, langley, secretary, of, the, smithsonian, institution, from, 1887, until, his, death, in, 1906, experimented, for, years, with, model, flying, machines, and, successfully, flew, unmanned, powered, fixed, wing, model, aircraft, in, 1896, and, 1903, two, tests, of, his, manned, full, size, motor, driven, aerodrome, in, october, and, december, 1903, however, were, complete, failures, nevertheless, the, smithsonian, later, proudly, displayed, the, aerodrome, in, its, museum, as, the, first, heavier, than, air, craft, capable, of, manned, powered, flight, relegating, the, wright, brothers, invention, to, secondary, status, and, triggering, a, decades, long, feud, with, orville, wright, whose, brother, had, received, help, from, the, smithsonian, when, beginning, his, own, quest, for, flight, the, smithsonian, based, its, claim, for, the, aerodrome, on, short, test, flights, glenn, curtiss, and, his, team, made, with, it, in, 1914, the, smithsonian, had, allowed, curtiss, to, make, major, modifications, to, the, craft, before, attempting, to, fly, it, the, smithsonian, hoped, to, salvage, langley, s, aeronautical, reputation, by, proving, the, aerodrome, could, fly, curtiss, wanted, to, prove, the, same, thing, to, defeat, the, wrights, patent, lawsuits, against, him, the, tests, had, no, effect, on, the, patent, battle, but, the, smithsonian, made, the, most, of, them, honoring, the, aerodrome, in, its, museum, and, publications, the, institution, did, not, reveal, the, extensive, curtiss, modifications, but, orville, wright, learned, of, them, from, his, brother, lorin, and, a, close, friend, of, his, and, wilbur, s, griffith, brewer, who, both, witnessed, and, photographed, some, of, the, tests, orville, repeatedly, objected, to, misrepresentation, of, the, aerodrome, but, the, smithsonian, was, unyielding, orville, responded, by, lending, the, restored, 1903, kitty, hawk, flyer, to, the, london, science, museum, in, 1928, refusing, to, donate, it, to, the, smithsonian, while, the, institution, perverted, the, history, of, the, flying, machine, 491, orville, would, never, see, his, invention, again, as, he, died, before, its, return, to, the, united, states, charles, lindbergh, attempted, to, mediate, the, dispute, to, no, avail, in, 1942, after, years, of, bad, publicity, and, encouraged, by, wright, biographer, f, c, kelly, the, smithsonian, finally, relented, by, publishing, for, the, first, time, a, list, of, the, aerodrome, modifications, and, recanting, the, misleading, statements, it, had, published, about, the, 1914, tests, orville, then, privately, requested, the, british, museum, to, return, the, flyer, but, the, airplane, remained, in, protective, storage, for, the, duration, of, world, war, ii, it, finally, came, home, after, orville, s, death, on, november, 23, 1948, the, executors, of, orville, s, estate, signed, an, agreement, for, the, smithsonian, to, purchase, the, flyer, for, one, dollar, at, the, insistence, of, the, executors, the, agreement, also, included, strict, conditions, for, display, of, the, airplane, the, agreement, reads, in, part, neither, the, smithsonian, institution, or, its, successors, nor, any, museum, or, other, agency, bureau, or, facilities, administered, for, the, united, states, of, america, by, the, smithsonian, institution, or, its, successors, shall, publish, or, permit, to, be, displayed, a, statement, or, label, in, connection, with, or, in, respect, of, any, aircraft, model, or, design, of, earlier, date, than, the, 1903, wright, aeroplane, claiming, in, effect, that, such, aircraft, was, capable, of, carrying, a, man, under, its, own, power, in, controlled, flight, if, this, agreement, is, not, fulfilled, the, flyer, can, be, reclaimed, by, the, heir, of, the, wright, brothers, some, aviation, enthusiasts, particularly, those, who, promote, the, legacy, of, gustave, whitehead, have, accused, the, smithsonian, of, refusing, to, investigate, claims, of, earlier, flights, after, a, ceremony, in, the, smithsonian, museum, the, flyer, went, on, public, display, on, december, 17, 1948, the, 45th, anniversary, of, the, only, day, it, was, flown, successfully, the, wright, brothers, nephew, milton, lorin, s, son, who, had, seen, gliders, and, the, flyer, under, construction, in, the, bicycle, shop, when, he, was, a, boy, gave, a, brief, speech, and, formally, transferred, the, airplane, to, the, smithsonian, which, displayed, it, with, the, accompanying, label, the, world, s, first, power, driven, heavier, than, air, machine, in, which, man, made, free, controlled, and, sustained, flight, invented, and, built, by, wilbur, and, orville, wright, flown, by, them, at, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, december, 17, 1903, by, original, scientific, research, the, wright, brothers, discovered, the, principles, of, human, flight, as, inventors, builders, and, flyers, they, further, developed, the, aeroplane, taught, man, to, fly, and, opened, the, era, of, aviation, both, wilbur, and, orville, were, lifelong, bachelors, wilbur, once, quipped, that, he, did, not, have, time, for, both, a, wife, and, an, airplane, 118, the, 1909, short, silent, film, wilbur, wright, und, seine, flugmaschine, which, translates, to, wilbur, wright, and, his, flying, machine, is, considered, to, be, the, first, use, of, motion, picture, aerial, photography, as, filmed, from, a, heavier, than, air, aircraft, following, a, brief, training, flight, he, gave, to, a, german, pilot, in, berlin, in, june, 1911, wilbur, never, flew, again, he, gradually, became, occupied, with, business, matters, for, the, wright, company, and, dealing, with, different, lawsuits, upon, dealing, with, the, patent, lawsuits, which, had, put, great, strain, on, both, brothers, wilbur, had, written, in, a, letter, to, a, french, friend, when, we, think, what, we, might, have, accomplished, if, we, had, been, able, to, devote, this, time, to, experiments, we, feel, very, sad, but, it, is, always, easier, to, deal, with, things, than, with, men, and, no, one, can, direct, his, life, entirely, as, he, would, choose, wilbur, spent, the, next, year, before, his, death, traveling, where, he, spent, a, full, six, months, in, europe, attending, to, various, business, and, legal, matters, wilbur, urged, american, cities, to, emulate, the, european, particularly, parisian, philosophy, of, apportioning, generous, public, space, near, every, important, public, building, he, was, also, constantly, back, and, forth, between, new, york, washington, and, dayton, all, of, the, stresses, were, taking, a, toll, on, wilbur, physically, orville, would, remark, that, he, would, come, home, white, it, was, decided, by, the, family, that, a, new, and, far, grander, house, would, be, built, using, the, money, that, the, wrights, had, earned, through, their, inventions, and, business, called, affectionately, hawthorn, hill, building, had, begun, in, the, dayton, suburb, of, oakwood, ohio, while, wilbur, was, in, europe, katharine, and, orville, oversaw, the, project, in, his, absence, wilbur, s, one, known, expression, upon, the, design, of, the, house, was, that, he, have, a, room, and, bathroom, of, his, own, the, brothers, hired, schenck, and, williams, an, architectural, firm, to, design, the, house, along, with, input, from, both, wilbur, and, orville, wilbur, did, not, live, to, see, its, completion, in, 1914, he, became, ill, on, a, business, trip, to, boston, in, april, 1912, the, illness, is, sometimes, attributed, to, eating, bad, shellfish, at, a, banquet, after, returning, to, dayton, in, early, may, 1912, worn, down, in, mind, and, body, he, fell, ill, again, and, was, diagnosed, with, typhoid, fever, he, lingered, on, his, symptoms, relapsing, and, remitting, for, many, days, wilbur, died, at, age, 45, at, the, wright, family, home, on, may, 30, his, father, wrote, about, wilbur, in, his, diary, a, short, life, full, of, consequences, an, unfailing, intellect, imperturbable, temper, great, self, reliance, and, as, great, modesty, seeing, the, right, clearly, pursuing, it, steadfastly, he, lived, and, died, 449, orville, succeeded, to, the, presidency, of, the, wright, company, upon, wilbur, s, death, he, won, the, prestigious, collier, trophy, in, 1914, for, development, of, his, automatic, stabilizer, on, the, brothers, wright, model, e, sharing, wilbur, s, distaste, for, business, but, not, his, brother, s, executive, skills, orville, sold, the, company, in, 1915, the, wright, company, then, became, part, of, wright, martin, in, 1916, after, 42, years, living, at, their, residence, on, 7, hawthorn, street, orville, katharine, and, their, father, milton, moved, to, hawthorn, hill, in, spring, 1914, milton, died, in, his, sleep, on, april, 3, 1917, at, age, 88, up, until, his, death, milton, had, been, very, active, preoccupied, with, reading, writing, articles, for, religious, publications, and, enjoying, his, morning, walks, he, had, also, marched, in, a, dayton, woman, s, suffrage, parade, along, with, orville, and, katharine, orville, made, his, last, flight, as, a, pilot, in, 1918, in, a, 1911, model, b, he, retired, from, business, and, became, an, elder, statesman, of, aviation, serving, on, various, official, boards, and, committees, including, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, naca, and, aeronautical, chamber, of, commerce, acca, katharine, married, henry, haskell, of, kansas, city, a, former, oberlin, classmate, in, 1926, orville, was, furious, and, inconsolable, feeling, he, had, been, betrayed, by, his, sister, katharine, he, refused, to, attend, the, wedding, or, even, communicate, with, her, he, finally, agreed, to, see, her, apparently, at, lorin, s, insistence, just, before, she, died, of, pneumonia, on, march, 3, 1929, orville, wright, served, in, the, naca, for, 28, years, in, 1930, he, received, the, first, daniel, guggenheim, medal, established, in, 1928, by, the, daniel, guggenheim, fund, for, the, promotion, of, aeronautics, in, 1936, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1939, president, franklin, delano, roosevelt, issued, a, presidential, proclamation, which, designated, the, anniversary, of, orville, s, birthday, as, national, aviation, day, a, national, observation, that, celebrates, the, development, of, aviation, on, april, 19, 1944, the, second, production, lockheed, constellation, piloted, by, howard, hughes, and, twa, president, jack, frye, flew, from, burbank, california, to, washington, d, c, in, 6, hours, and, 57, minutes, 2, 300, mi, 330, 9, mph, on, the, return, trip, the, airliner, stopped, at, wright, field, to, give, orville, wright, his, last, airplane, flight, more, than, 40, years, after, his, historic, first, flight, he, may, even, have, briefly, handled, the, controls, he, commented, that, the, wingspan, of, the, constellation, was, longer, than, the, distance, of, his, first, flight, orville, s, last, major, project, was, supervising, the, reclamation, and, preservation, of, the, 1905, wright, flyer, iii, which, historians, describe, as, the, first, practical, airplane, orville, expressed, sadness, in, an, interview, years, later, about, the, death, and, destruction, brought, about, by, the, bombers, of, world, war, ii, we, dared, to, hope, we, had, invented, something, that, would, bring, lasting, peace, to, the, earth, but, we, were, wrong, no, i, don, t, have, any, regrets, about, my, part, in, the, invention, of, the, airplane, though, no, one, could, deplore, more, than, i, do, the, destruction, it, has, caused, i, feel, about, the, airplane, much, the, same, as, i, do, in, regard, to, fire, that, is, i, regret, all, the, terrible, damage, caused, by, fire, but, i, think, it, is, good, for, the, human, race, that, someone, discovered, how, to, start, fires, and, that, we, have, learned, how, to, put, fire, to, thousands, of, important, uses, orville, died, at, age, 76, on, january, 30, 1948, over, 35, years, after, his, brother, following, his, second, heart, attack, having, lived, from, the, horse, and, buggy, age, to, the, dawn, of, supersonic, flight, both, brothers, are, buried, in, the, family, plot, at, woodland, cemetery, dayton, ohio, john, t, daniels, the, coast, guardsman, who, took, their, famous, first, flight, photo, died, the, day, after, orville, first, powered, flight, claims, are, made, for, cl, ment, ader, gustave, whitehead, richard, pearse, and, karl, jatho, for, their, variously, documented, tests, in, years, prior, to, and, including, 1903, claims, that, the, first, true, flight, occurred, after, 1903, are, made, for, traian, vuia, and, alberto, santos, dumont, supporters, of, the, post, wright, pioneers, argue, that, techniques, used, by, the, wright, brothers, disqualify, them, as, first, to, make, successful, airplane, flights, those, techniques, were, a, launch, rail, skids, instead, of, wheels, a, headwind, at, takeoff, and, a, catapult, after, 1903, supporters, of, the, wright, brothers, argue, that, proven, repeated, controlled, and, sustained, flights, by, the, brothers, entitle, them, to, credit, as, inventors, of, the, airplane, regardless, of, those, techniques, the, aviation, historian, c, h, gibbs, smith, was, a, supporter, of, the, wrights, claim, to, primacy, in, flight, he, wrote, that, a, barn, door, can, be, made, to, fly, for, a, short, distance, if, enough, energy, is, applied, to, it, he, determined, that, the, very, limited, flight, experiments, of, ader, vuia, and, others, were, powered, hops, instead, of, fully, controlled, flights, the, u, s, states, of, ohio, and, north, carolina, both, take, credit, for, the, wright, brothers, and, their, world, changing, inventions, ohio, because, the, brothers, developed, and, built, their, designs, in, dayton, and, north, carolina, because, kitty, hawk, was, the, site, of, the, wrights, first, powered, flight, with, a, spirit, of, friendly, rivalry, ohio, adopted, the, slogan, birthplace, of, aviation, later, birthplace, of, aviation, pioneers, recognizing, not, only, the, wrights, but, also, astronauts, john, glenn, and, neil, armstrong, both, ohio, natives, the, slogan, appears, on, ohio, license, plates, north, carolina, uses, the, slogan, first, in, flight, on, its, license, plates, the, site, of, the, first, flights, in, north, carolina, is, preserved, as, wright, brothers, national, memorial, while, their, ohio, facilities, are, part, of, dayton, aviation, heritage, national, historical, park, as, the, positions, of, both, states, can, be, factually, defended, and, each, played, a, significant, role, in, the, history, of, flight, neither, state, has, an, exclusive, claim, to, the, wrights, accomplishment, notwithstanding, the, competition, between, those, two, states, in, 1937, the, wrights, last, bicycle, shop, and, home, were, moved, from, dayton, ohio, to, greenfield, village, in, dearborn, michigan, where, they, remain, in, addition, to, appearing, on, both, the, front, and, back, of, the, official, united, states, pilot, certification, the, wright, brothers, and, their, airplane, have, been, commemorated, on, several, u, s, postage, stamps, including, nasa, named, the, first, martian, airfield, for, the, ingenuity, helicopter, wright, brothers, field, the, miniature, helicopter, arrived, on, mars, on, february, 18, 2021, attached, to, the, perseverance, rover, a, small, piece, of, wing, fabric, from, the, 1903, wright, flyer, was, attached, to, a, cable, underneath, ingenuity, s, solar, panel, in, 1969, neil, armstrong, carried, a, similar, wright, flyer, artifact, to, the, moon, in, the, lunar, module, eagle, during, apollo, 11, ingenuity, flew, five, times, from, wright, brothers, field, between, april, 19, and, may, 7, 2021, then, departed, for, other, areas, making, a, total, of, 72, flights
