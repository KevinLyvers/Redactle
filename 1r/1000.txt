477, he, ruled, over, a, kingdom, and, played, a, key, role, in, the, decline, of, the, western, roman, empire, during, the, 5th, century, the, murder, of, roman, emperor, valentinian, iii, who, had, betrothed, his, daughter, to, gaiseric, s, son, huneric, led, the, vandal, king, to, invade, italy, the, invasion, culminated, in, his, most, famous, exploit, the, capture, and, plundering, of, rome, in, june, 455, gaiseric, repulsed, two, major, attempts, by, both, halves, of, the, roman, empire, to, reclaim, north, africa, inflicting, devastating, defeats, on, the, forces, of, majorian, in, 460, and, basiliscus, in, 468, as, a, result, the, romans, abandoned, their, campaign, against, the, vandals, and, concluded, peace, with, gaiseric, gaiseric, died, in, carthage, in, 477, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, huneric, through, his, nearly, fifty, years, of, rule, gaiseric, raised, a, relatively, inconsequential, germanic, tribe, to, the, status, of, a, major, mediterranean, power, after, his, father, s, death, in, a, battle, against, the, franks, during, the, crossing, of, the, rhine, gaiseric, became, the, second, most, powerful, man, among, the, vandals, after, the, newly, appointed, king, his, half, brother, gunderic, his, status, as, a, noble, of, the, king, s, family, occurred, before, his, more, formal, accession, to, the, kingship, jordanes, described, gaiseric, in, the, following, manner, gaiseric, was, a, man, of, moderate, height, and, lame, in, consequence, of, a, fall, from, his, horse, he, was, a, man, of, deep, thought, and, few, words, holding, luxury, in, disdain, furious, in, his, anger, greedy, for, gain, shrewd, in, winning, over, the, barbarians, and, skilled, in, sowing, the, seeds, of, dissension, to, arouse, enmity, gunderic, s, death, in, 428, paved, the, way, for, gaiseric, s, ascension, to, king, of, the, vandals, his, rise, to, power, was, accompanied, by, continued, hostilities, against, competing, powers, begun, by, his, brother, he, likewise, sought, ways, of, increasing, the, power, and, wealth, of, his, people, vandals, and, some, alans, who, then, resided, in, the, roman, province, of, hispania, baetica, in, southern, hispania, the, vandals, had, suffered, greatly, from, attacks, from, the, more, numerous, visigothic, federates, and, not, long, after, taking, power, gaiseric, decided, to, leave, hispania, to, his, rivals, in, fact, he, seems, to, have, started, building, a, vandal, fleet, for, a, potential, exodus, even, before, he, became, king, before, he, could, make, his, move, to, africa, gaiseric, was, attacked, by, a, large, force, of, suebi, under, the, command, of, heremigarius, who, had, managed, to, take, lusitania, however, this, suebic, army, was, later, defeated, during, the, battle, of, m, rida, 428, and, its, leader, drowned, in, the, guadiana, river, while, trying, to, flee, after, defending, the, aforementioned, suebian, attack, at, m, rida, gaiseric, led, most, of, his, people, possibly, as, many, as, 80, 000, persons, to, northern, africa, in, 428, 429, some, scholars, claim, that, this, figure, represents, an, exaggeration, and, the, number, was, probably, closer, to, 20, 000, whatever, the, true, numbers, there, are, indications, that, the, vandals, under, gaiseric, may, have, been, invited, by, the, roman, governor, bonifacius, who, wished, to, use, the, military, strength, of, the, vandals, in, his, struggle, against, the, imperial, government, under, the, roman, general, aetius, crossing, at, the, straits, of, gibraltar, gaiseric, led, not, only, his, vandal, brethren, and, army, but, was, likely, accompanied, by, a, contingent, of, alans, and, goths, once, there, he, won, many, battles, over, the, weak, and, divided, roman, defenders, and, quickly, overran, the, territory, now, comprising, modern, morocco, and, northern, algeria, his, vandal, army, defeated, the, bonifatius, army, in, the, battle, of, calama, and, laid, siege, to, the, city, of, hippo, regius, where, augustine, had, recently, been, bishop, and, who, died, during, the, siege, taking, it, after, 14, months, of, bitter, fighting, gaiseric, and, his, forces, then, began, subduing, the, interior, of, numidia, a, peace, between, gaiseric, and, the, roman, emperor, valentinian, iii, was, concluded, in, 435, and, in, return, for, recognizing, gaiseric, as, king, of, the, lands, he, had, conquered, the, vandals, would, desist, from, further, attacks, on, carthage, pay, a, tribute, to, the, empire, and, gaiseric, s, son, huneric, was, sent, as, a, hostage, to, rome, gaiseric, s, treaty, with, the, romans, also, included, vandal, retention, of, mauretania, and, part, of, numidia, as, foederati, allies, under, special, treaty, of, rome, in, a, surprise, move, on, 19, october, 439, gaiseric, captured, carthage, striking, a, devastating, blow, at, imperial, power, taking, advantage, of, the, fact, that, aetius, remained, preoccupied, with, affairs, in, gaul, classical, scholar, stewart, oost, observed, thus, he, undoubtedly, achieved, what, had, been, his, purpose, since, he, first, crossed, to, africa, historian, chris, wickham, argues, that, gaiseric, s, conquest, of, carthage, presaged, rome, s, later, collapse, the, romans, were, caught, unaware, and, gaiseric, captured, a, large, part, of, the, western, roman, navy, docked, in, the, port, of, carthage, the, catholic, bishop, of, the, city, quodvultdeus, was, exiled, to, naples, since, gaiseric, demanded, that, all, his, close, advisors, follow, the, arian, form, of, christianity, the, subsequent, sermons, of, quodvultdeus, paint, a, dark, picture, of, the, vandal, plunderers, despite, the, blow, to, the, imperial, coffers, caused, by, gaiseric, s, seizure, of, african, revenue, and, the, corresponding, grain, supply, the, vandal, king, had, no, intention, of, depriving, italy, of, africa, s, grain, but, instead, wished, to, sell, it, to, the, emperor, for, profit, meanwhile, his, new, status, was, that, of, proconsularis, and, as, such, gaiseric, made, carthage, his, new, residence, inheriting, an, already, economically, efficient, and, effective, state, the, tax, revenues, from, his, new, lands, enabled, the, vandal, conqueror, to, construct, a, large, fleet, that, challenged, imperial, control, over, the, mediterranean, gaiseric, presided, over, a, mixture, of, vandals, alans, goths, and, romans, in, africa, relying, on, an, ad, hoc, administration, under, auspices, of, the, imperial, government, to, legitimize, his, rule, latin, literary, culture, even, flourished, in, carthage, gaiseric, besieged, panormus, palermo, sicily, in, 440, ad, but, was, repulsed, hunnic, invasions, into, the, lower, danube, forced, constantinople, to, withdraw, forces, from, sicily, to, the, benefit, of, gaiseric, in, a, 442, treaty, with, rome, the, vandals, were, recognized, as, the, independent, rulers, of, byzacena, and, part, of, numidia, in, 455, gaiseric, seized, the, balearic, islands, sardinia, corsica, and, malta, and, his, fleet, soon, came, to, control, much, of, the, western, mediterranean, during, 455, the, roman, emperor, valentinian, iii, was, murdered, on, orders, of, petronius, maximus, who, usurped, the, throne, petronius, maximus, also, married, valentinian, s, widow, licinia, eudoxia, and, likewise, wedded, the, imperial, couple, s, daughter, eudocia, to, his, own, son, the, latter, had, formerly, been, promised, to, gaiseric, s, son, huneric, which, contributed, a, possible, casus, belli, that, was, exploited, by, the, vandal, king, gaiseric, was, of, the, opinion, that, these, acts, voided, his, 442, peace, treaty, with, valentinian, and, on, 31, may, he, and, his, men, landed, on, italian, soil, responding, to, the, actions, of, petronius, maximus, gaiseric, moved, a, large, seaborne, force, from, carthage, to, italy, and, sacked, the, city, in, a, more, thorough, manner, than, even, alaric, s, goths, had, carried, out, in, 410, historian, michael, kulikowski, notes, that, unlike, alaric, who, besieged, rome, as, an, itinerant, barbarian, general, in, desperate, straits, gaiseric, was, the, king, of, a, flourishing, polity, and, was, therefore, able, to, systematically, conduct, the, sack, more, than, just, systematically, attack, rome, gaiseric, s, invasion, was, a, devastating, blow, to, the, empire, itself, so, much, so, that, historian, michael, grant, claims, gaiseric, contributed, more, to, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, than, any, other, single, man, before, gaiseric, marched, upon, rome, pope, leo, i, implored, him, not, to, destroy, the, ancient, city, or, murder, its, inhabitants, gaiseric, agreed, and, the, gates, of, rome, were, thrown, open, to, him, and, his, men, once, inside, the, city, the, invaders, plundered, it, thoroughly, to, the, extent, that, procopius, noted, how, the, vandals, had, even, stripped, the, gold, from, the, ceiling, of, the, jupiter, capitolinus, temple, but, more, significant, was, the, capture, of, important, figures, and, dignitaries, in, the, city, whose, return, remained, a, bargaining, point, between, the, vandals, and, the, empire, for, many, years, to, come, routine, vandal, raids, along, the, coast, of, italy, and, the, mediterranean, characterized, the, situation, during, the, first, years, after, gaiseric, s, successful, seizure, of, rome, petronius, maximus, who, was, foremost, among, those, vying, for, power, in, the, wake, of, valentinian, iii, s, murder, fled, rather, than, fight, the, vandal, warlord, although, history, remembers, the, vandal, sack, of, rome, as, extremely, brutal, making, the, word, vandalism, a, term, for, any, wantonly, destructive, act, in, actuality, the, vandals, did, not, wreak, great, destruction, in, the, city, they, did, however, take, gold, silver, and, many, other, things, of, value, gaiseric, also, took, with, him, empress, eudoxia, and, her, daughters, eudocia, and, placidia, as, well, as, riches, from, the, city, across, italy, the, shock, of, the, vandal, sack, of, rome, and, the, ongoing, presence, of, the, vandals, paralyzed, the, imperial, government, eudocia, married, gaiseric, s, son, huneric, after, arriving, in, carthage, that, union, produced, hilderic, gaiseric, s, grandson, who, later, played, a, critical, role, in, emperor, justinian, s, sixth, century, conquests, of, north, africa, sometime, in, 460, the, emperor, majorian, began, collecting, an, invasion, fleet, for, an, assault, against, the, vandals, once, gaiseric, received, word, of, this, initiative, he, preempted, the, attack, by, sending, vessels, from, carthage, to, carthago, nova, where, the, vandal, ships, burned, the, imperial, boats, at, their, moorings, again, proving, himself, more, than, a, match, for, the, imperial, establishments, of, both, west, and, east, then, in, early, 462, gaiseric, sent, the, empress, eudoxia, with, her, daughters, eudocia, and, placidia, captured, during, the, sack, of, rome, back, to, constantinople, from, carthage, in, an, act, of, reconciliation, with, the, empire, likely, intending, to, preserve, the, marriage, of, his, son, huneric, to, eudocia, while, rhetorical, writing, from, the, period, still, distinguished, between, barbarian, and, romans, and, the, imperial, state, attempted, to, exercise, control, over, the, empire, and, its, peripheries, the, elite, population, in, the, lands, controlled, by, the, likes, of, the, germanic, chieftains, theodoric, and, gaiseric, preferred, the, certainties, of, their, leadership, over, the, vagaries, and, ineptitude, of, the, would, be, imperial, government, in, italy, in, 468, gaiseric, s, kingdom, was, the, target, of, the, last, concerted, effort, by, the, two, halves, of, the, roman, empire, they, wished, to, subdue, the, vandals, and, end, their, pirate, raids, so, emperor, leo, sent, an, armada, from, constantinople, led, by, basiliscus, gaiseric, sent, a, fleet, of, 500, vandal, ships, against, the, romans, losing, 340, ships, in, the, first, engagement, but, succeeded, in, destroying, 600, roman, ships, in, the, second, battle, during, which, fireships, were, employed, by, gaiseric, to, devastating, effect, this, catastrophic, defeat, of, the, roman, fleet, by, gaiseric, s, forces, was, claimed, to, have, cost, the, imperial, coffers, upwards, of, 64, 000, pounds, of, gold, and, 700, 000, pounds, of, silver, the, romans, abandoned, the, campaign, and, gaiseric, remained, master, of, the, western, mediterranean, until, his, death, ruling, from, the, strait, of, gibraltar, all, the, way, to, tripolitania, following, up, the, byzantine, defeat, the, vandals, tried, to, invade, the, peloponnese, but, were, driven, back, by, the, maniots, at, kenipolis, with, heavy, losses, in, retaliation, the, vandals, took, 500, hostages, at, zakynthos, hacked, them, to, pieces, and, threw, the, body, parts, overboard, on, the, way, to, carthage, in, 474, gaiseric, made, peace, with, the, eastern, roman, empire, through, a, treaty, negotiated, by, the, constantinopolitan, senator, severus, who, was, acting, under, zeno, s, authority, after, enjoying, just, a, few, short, years, of, peace, gaiseric, died, at, carthage, in, 477, succeeded, by, his, son, huneric, who, did, not, have, his, father, s, enviable, reputation, and, vandal, authority, began, to, diminish, nonetheless, the, peace, established, by, zeno, between, vandal, controlled, carthage, and, constantinople, lasted, until, 530, when, justinian, s, conquests, broke, it
