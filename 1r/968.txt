world, in, his, very, definite, word, black, theology, has, to, do, with, whether, it, is, possible, to, be, black, and, continue, to, be, christian, it, is, to, ask, on, whose, side, is, god, it, is, to, be, concerned, about, the, humanisation, of, man, because, those, who, ravage, our, humanity, dehumanise, themselves, in, the, process, that, the, liberation, of, the, black, man, is, the, other,

proceed, regardless, seeking, to, fuse, the, african, american, derived, black, theology, with, african, theology, tutu, s, approach, contrasted, with, that, of, those, african, theologians, like,

people, of, god, tutu, advocated, what, liberation, theologians, call, critical, solidarity, offering, support, for, pro, democracy, forces, while, reserving, the, right, to, criticise, his, allies, he, criticised, mandela, on, several, points, such, as, his, tendency, to, wear, brightly, coloured, madiba, shirts, which, he, regarded, as, inappropriate, mandela, offered, the, tongue, in, cheek, response, that, it, was, ironic, coming, from, a, man, who, wore, dresses, more, serious, was, tutu, s, criticism, of, mandela, s, retention, of, south, africa, s, apartheid, era, armaments, industry, and, the, significant, pay, packet, that, newly, elected, members, of, parliament, adopted, mandela, hit, back, calling, tutu, a, populist, and, stating, that, he, should, have, raised, these, issues, privately, rather, than, publicly, a, key, question, facing, the, post, apartheid, government, was, how, they, would, respond, to, the, various, human, rights, abuses, that, had, been, committed, over, the, previous, decades, by, both, the, state, and, by, anti, apartheid, activists, the, national, party, had, wanted, a, comprehensive, amnesty, package, whereas, the, anc, wanted, trials, of,

parliament, in, july, 1995, nuttall, suggested, that, tutu, become, one, of, the, trc, s, seventeen, commissioners, while, in, september, a, synod, of, bishops, formally, nominated, him, tutu, proposed, that, the, trc, adopt, a, threefold, approach, the, first, being, confession, with, those, responsible, for, human, rights, abuses, fully, disclosing, their, activities, the, second, being, forgiveness, in, the, form, of, a, legal, amnesty, from, prosecution, and, the, third, being, restitution, with, the, perpetrators, making, amends, to, their, victims, mandela, named, tutu, as, the, chair, of, the, trc, with, boraine, as, his, deputy, the, commission, was, a, significant, undertaking, employing, over, 300, staff, divided, into, three, committees, and, holding, as, many, as, four, hearings, simultaneously, in, the, trc, tutu, advocated, restorative, justice, something, which, he, considered, characteristic, of, traditional, african, jurisprudence, in, the, spirit, of, ubuntu, as, head, of, the, commission, tutu, had, to, deal, with, its, various, inter, personal, problems, with, much, suspicion, between, those, on, its, board, who, had, been, anti, apartheid, activists, and, those, who, had, supported, the, apartheid, system, he, acknowledged, that, we, really, were, like, a, bunch, of, prima, donnas, frequently, hypersensitive, often, taking, umbrage, easily, at, real, or, imagined, slights, tutu, opened, meetings, with, prayers, and, often, referred, to, christian, teachings, when, discussing, the, trc, s, work, frustrating, some, who, saw, him, as, incorporating, too, many, religious, elements, into, an, expressly, secular, body, the, first, hearing, took, place, in, april, 1996, the, hearings, were, publicly, televised, and, had, a, considerable, impact, on, south, african, society, he, had, very, little, control, over, the, committee, responsible, for, granting, amnesty, instead, chairing, the, committee, which, heard, accounts, of, human, rights, abuses, perpetrated, by, both, anti, apartheid, and, apartheid, figures, while, listening, to, the, testimony, of, victims, tutu, was, sometimes, overwhelmed, by, emotion, and, cried, during, the, hearings, he, singled, out, those, victims, who, expressed, forgiveness, towards, those, who, had, harmed, them, and, used, these, individuals, as, his, leitmotif, the, anc, s, image, was, tarnished, by, the, revelations, that, some, of, its, activists, had, engaged, in, torture, attacks, on, civilians, and, other, human, rights, abuses, it, sought, to, suppress, part, of, the, final, trc, report, infuriating, tutu, he, warned, of, the, anc, s, abuse, of, power, stating, that, yesterday, s, oppressed, can, quite, easily, become, today, s, oppressors, we, ve, seen, it, happen, all, over, the, world, and, we, shouldn, t, be, surprised, if, it, happens, here, tutu, presented, the, five, volume, trc, report, to, mandela, in, a, public, ceremony, in, pretoria, in, october, 1998, ultimately, tutu, was, pleased, with, the, trc, s, achievement, believing, that, it, would, aid, long, term, reconciliation, although, he, recognised, its, short, comings, i, would, refuse, to, go, to, a, homophobic, heaven, no, i, would, say, sorry, i, mean, i, would, much, rather, go, to, the, other, place, i, would, not, worship, a, god, who, is, homophobic, and, that, is, how, deeply, i, feel, about, this, i, am, as, passionate, about, this, campaign, as, i, ever, was, about, apartheid, for, me, it, is, at, the, same, level, tutu, in, 2013, post, apartheid, tutu, s, status, as, a, gay, rights, activist, kept, him, in, the, public, eye, more, than, any, other, issue, facing, the, anglican, church, his, views, on, the, issue, became, well, known, through, his, speeches, and, sermons, tutu, equated, discrimination, against, homosexuals, with, discrimination, against, black, people, and, women, after, the, 1998, lambeth, conference, of, bishops, reaffirmed, the, church, s, opposition, to, same, sex, sexual, acts, tutu, stated, that, he, was, ashamed, to, be, an, anglican, he, thought, archbishop, of, canterbury, rowan, williams, was, too, accommodating, towards, anglican, conservatives, who, wanted, to, eject, north, american, anglican, churches, from, the, anglican, communion, after, they, expressed, a, pro, gay, rights, stance, in, 2007, tutu,

the, hiv, aids, pandemic, in, june, 2003, stating, that, apartheid, tried, to, destroy, our, people, and, apartheid, failed, if, we, don, t, act, against, hiv, aids, it, may, succeed, for, it, is,

it, as, unfortunate, that, the, roman, catholic, church, was, now, unlikely, to, change, either, its, opposition, to, the, use, of, condoms, amidst, the, fight, against, hiv, aids, or, its, opposition, to, the, ordination, of, women, priests, to, help, combat, child, trafficking, in, 2006, tutu, launched, a, global, campaign, organised, by, the, aid, organisation, plan, to, ensure, that,

denouncing, israeli, policy, regarding, the, palestinians, and, calling, for, sanctions, against, israel, comparing, the, israeli, palestinian, situation, with, that, in, south, africa, he, said, that, one, reason, we, succeeded, in, south, africa, that, is, missing, in, the, middle, east, is, quality, of, leadership, leaders, willing, to, make, unpopular, compromises, to, go, against, their,

outgoing, du, boulay, noted, that, his, typical, african, warmth, and, a, spontaneous, lack, of, inhibition, proved, shocking, to, many, of, the, reticent, english, whom, he, encountered, when, in, england, but, that, it, also, meant, that, he, had, the, ability, to, endear, himself, to, virtually, everyone, who, actually, meets, him, du, boulay, noted, that, as, a, child, tutu, had, been, hard, working, and, unusually, intelligent, she, added, that, he, had, a, gentle, caring, temperament, and, would, have, nothing, to, do, with, anything, that, hurt, others, commenting, on, how, he, had, a, quicksilver, mind, a, disarming, honesty, tutu, was, rarely, angry, in, his, personal, contacts, with, others, although, could, become, so, if, he, felt, that, his, integrity, was, being, challenged, he, had, a, tendency, to, be, highly, trusting, something, which, some, of, those, close, to, him, sometimes, believed, was, unwise, in, various, situations, he, was, also, reportedly, bad, at, managing, finances, and, prone, to, overspending, resulting, in, accusations, of, irresponsibility, and, extravagance, tutu, had, a, passion, for, preserving, african, traditions, of, courtesy, he, could, be, offended, by, discourteous, behaviour, and, careless, language, as, well, as, by, swearing, and, ethnic, slurs, he, could, get, very, upset, if, a, member, of, his, staff, forgot, to, thank, him, or, did, not, apologise, for, being, late, to, a, prayer, session, he, also, disliked, gossip, and, discouraged, it, among, his, staff, he, was, very, punctual, and, insisted, on, punctuality, among, those, in, his, employ, du, boulay, noted, that, his, attention, to, the, detail, of, people, s, lives, is, remarkable, for, he, would, be, meticulous, in, recording, and, noting, people, s, birthdays, and, anniversaries, he, was, attentive, to, his, parishioners, making, an, effort, to, visit, and, spend, time, with, them, regularly, this, included, making, an, effort, to, visit, parishioners, who, disliked, him, according, to, du, boulay, tutu, had, a, deep, need, to, be, loved, a, facet, that, he, recognised, about, himself, and, referred, to, as, a, horrible, weakness, tutu, has, also, been, described, as, being, sensitive, and, very, easily, hurt, an, aspect, of, his, personality, which, he, concealed, from, the, public, eye, du, boulay, noted, that, he, reacts, to, emotional, pain, in, an, almost, childlike, way, he, never, denied, being, ambitious, and, acknowledged, that, he, enjoyed, the, limelight, which, his, position, gave, him, something, that, his, wife, often, teased, him, about, he, was, according, to, du, boulay, a, man, of, passionate, emotions, who, was, quick, to, both, laugh, and, cry, as, well, as, english, tutu, could, speak, zulu, sotho, tswana, and, xhosa, he, was, often, praised, for, his, public, speaking, abilities, du, boulay, noted, that, his, star, quality, enables, him, to, hold, an, audience, spellbound, gish, noted, that, tutu, s, voice, and, manner, could, light, up, an, audience, he, never, sounded, puritanical, or, humourless, quick, witted, he, used, humour, to, try, and, win, over, audiences, he, had, a, talent, for, mimicry, according, to, du, boulay, his, humour, has, none, of, the, cool, acerbity, that, makes, for, real, wit, his, application, of, humour, included, jokes, that, made, a, point, about, apartheid, the, whites, think, the, black, people, want, to, drive, them, into, the, sea, what, they, forget, is, with, apartheid, on, the, beaches, we, can, t, even, go, to, the, sea, in, a, speech, made, at, the, sixth, assembly, of, the, world, council, of, churches, in, vancouver, he, drew, laughs, from, the, audience, for, referring, to, south, africa, as, having, a, few, local, problems, tutu, had, a, lifelong, love, of, literature, and, reading, and, was, a, fan, of, cricket, to, relax, he, enjoyed, listening, to, classical, music, and, reading, books, on, politics, or, religion, his, favourite, foods, included, samosas, marshmallows, fat, cakes, and, yogi, sip, when, hosts, asked, what, his, culinary, tastes, were, his, wife, responded, think, of, a, five, year, old, tutu, woke, at, 4, am, every, morning, before, engaging, in, an, early, morning, walk, prayers, and, the, eucharist, on, fridays, he, fasted, until, supper, tutu, was, a, committed, christian, from, boyhood, prayer, was, a, big, part, of, his, life, he, often, spent, an, hour, in, prayer, at, the, start, of, each, day, and, would, ensure, that, every, meeting, or, interview, that, he, was, part, of, was, preceded, by, a, short, prayer, he, was, even, known, to, often, pray, while, driving, he, read, the, bible, every, day, and, recommended, that, people, read, it, as, a, collection, of, books, not, a, single, constitutional, document, you, have, to, understand, that, the, bible, is, really, a, library, of, books, and, it, has, different, categories, of, material, he, said, there, are, certain, parts, which, you, have, to, say, no, to, the, bible, accepted, slavery, st, paul, said, women, should, not, speak, in, church, at, all, and, there, are, people, who, have, used, that, to, say, women, should, not, be, ordained, there, are, many, things, that, you, shouldn, t, accept, on, 2, july, 1955, tutu, married, nomalizo, leah, shenxane, a, teacher, whom, he, had, met, while, at, college, they, had, four, children, trevor, thamsanqa, theresa, thandeka, naomi, nontombi, and, mpho, andrea, all, of, whom, attended, the, waterford, kamhlaba, school, in, swaziland, du, boulay, referred, to, him, as, a, loving, and, concerned, father, while, allen, described, him, as, a, loving, but, strict, father, to, his, children, allen, stated, that, the, theme, running, through, tutu, s, campaigning, was, that, of, democracy, human, rights, and, tolerance, to, be, achieved, by, dialogue, and, accommodation, between, enemies, racial, equality, was, a, core, principle, and, his, opposition, to, apartheid, was, unequivocal, tutu, believed, that, the, apartheid, system, had, to, be, wholly, dismantled, rather, than, being, reformed, in, a, piecemeal, fashion, he, compared, the, apartheid, ethos, of, south, africa, s, national, party, to, the, ideas, of, the, nazi, party, and, drew, comparisons, between, apartheid, policy, and, the, holocaust, he, noted, that, whereas, the, latter, was, a, quicker, and, more, efficient, way, of, exterminating, whole, populations, the, national, party, s, policy, of, forcibly, relocating, black, south, africans, to, areas, where, they, lacked, access, to, food, and, sanitation, had, much, the, same, result, in, his, words, apartheid, is, as, evil, and, as, vicious, as, nazism, and, communism, tutu, never, became, anti, white, in, part, due, to, his, many, positive, experiences, with, white, people, in, his, speeches, he, stressed, that, it, was, apartheid, rather, than, white, people, that, was, the, enemy, he, promoted, racial, reconciliation, between, south, africa, s, communities, believing, that, most, blacks, fundamentally, wanted, to, live, in, harmony, with, whites, although, he, stressed, that, reconciliation, would, only, be, possible, among, equals, after, blacks, had, been, given, full, civil, rights, he, tried, to, cultivate, goodwill, from, the, country, s, white, community, making, a, point, of, showing, white, individuals, gratitude, when, they, made, concessions, to, black, demands, he, also, spoke, to, many, white, audiences, urging, them, to, support, his, cause, referring, to, it, as, the, winning, side, and, reminding, them, that, when, apartheid, had, been, overthrown, black, south, africans, would, remember, who, their, friends, had, been, when, he, held, public, prayers, he, always, included, mention, of, those, who, upheld, apartheid, such, as, politicians, and, police, alongside, the, system, s, victims, emphasising, his, view, that, all, humans, were, the, children, of, god, he, stated, that, the, people, who, are, perpetrators, of, injury, in, our, land, are, not, sporting, horns, or, tails, they, re, just, ordinary, people, who, are, scared, wouldn, t, you, be, scared, if, you, were, outnumbered, five, to, one, tutu, was, always, committed, to, non, violent, activism, and, in, his, speeches, was, also, cautious, never, to, threaten, or, endorse, violence, even, when, he, warned, that, it, was, a, likely, outcome, of, government, policy, he, nevertheless, described, himself, as, a, man, of, peace, rather, than, a, pacifist, he, for, instance, accepted, that, violence, had, been, necessary, to, stop, nazism, in, the, south, african, situation, he, criticised, the, use, of, violence, by, both, the, government, and, anti, apartheid, groups, although, he, was, also, critical, of, white, south, africans, who, would, only, condemn, the, use, of, violence, by, the, latter, regarding, such, a, position, as, a, case, of, a, double, standard, to, end, apartheid, he, advocated, foreign, economic, pressure, be, put, on, south, africa, to, critics, who, claimed, that, this, measure, would, only, cause, further, hardship, for, impoverished, black, south, africans, he, responded, that, said, communities, were, already, experiencing, significant, hardship, and, that, it, would, be, better, if, they, were, suffering, with, a, purpose, during, the, apartheid, period, he, criticised, the, black, leaders, of, the, bantustans, describing, them, as, largely, corrupt, men, looking, after, their, own, interests, lining, their, pockets, buthelezi, the, leader, of, the, zulu, bantustan, privately, claimed, that, there, was, something, radically, wrong, with, tutu, s, personality, in, the, 1980s, tutu, also, condemned, western, political, leaders, namely, ronald, reagan, margaret, thatcher, and, west, germany, s, helmut, kohl, for, retaining, links, with, the, south, african, government, stipulating, that, support, of, this, racist, policy, is, racist, regarding, reagan, he, stated, that, although, he, once, thought, him, a, crypto, racist, for, his, soft, stance, on, the, national, party, administration, he, would, say, now, that, he, is, a, racist, pure, and, simple, he, and, his, wife, boycotted, a, lecture, given, at, the, federal, theological, institute, by, former, british, prime, minister, alec, douglas, home, in, the, 1960s, tutu, noted, that, they, did, so, because, britain, s, conservative, party, had, behaved, abominably, over, issues, which, touched, our, hearts, most, nearly, later, in, life, he, also, spoke, out, against, various, african, leaders, for, instance, describing, zimbabwe, s, robert, mugabe, as, the, caricature, of, an, african, dictator, who, had, gone, bonkers, in, a, big, way, according, to, du, boulay, tutu, s, politics, spring, directly, and, inevitably, from, his, christianity, he, believed, that, it, was, the, duty, of, christians, to, oppose, unjust, laws, and, that, there, could, be, no, separation, between, the, religious, and, the, political, just, as, according, to, anglican, theology, there, is, no, separation, between, the, spiritual, realm, the, holy, ghost, and, the, material, one, jesus, christ, however, he, was, adamant, that, he, was, not, personally, a, politician, he, felt, that, religious, leaders, like, himself, should, stay, outside, of, party, politics, citing, the, example, of, abel, muzorewa, in, zimbabwe, makarios, iii, in, cyprus, and, ruhollah, khomeini, in, iran, as, examples, in, which, such, crossovers, proved, problematic, he, tried, to, avoid, alignment, with, any, particular, political, party, in, the, 1980s, for, instance, he, signed, a, plea, urging, anti, apartheid, activists, in, the, united, states, to, support, both, the, anc, and, the, pan, africanist, congress, pac, du, boulay, however, noted, that, tutu, was, most, at, home, with, the, udf, umbrella, organisation, and, that, his, views, on, a, multi, racial, alliance, against, apartheid, placed, him, closer, to, the, approach, of, the, anc, and, udf, than, the, blacks, only, approach, favoured, by, the, pac, and, black, consciousness, groups, like, azapo, when, in, the, late, 1980s, there, were, suggestions, that, he, should, take, political, office, he, rejected, the, idea, when, pressed, to, describe, his, ideological, position, tutu, described, himself, as, a, socialist, in, 1986, he, related, that, ll, my, experiences, with, capitalism, i, m, afraid, have, indicated, that, it, encourages, some, of, the, worst, features, in, people, eat, or, be, eaten, it, is, underlined, by, the, survival, of, the, fittest, i, can, t, buy, that, i, mean, maybe, it, s, the, awful, face, of, capitalism, but, i, haven, t, seen, the, other, face, also, in, the, 1980s, he, was, reported, as, saying, that, apartheid, has, given, free, enterprise, a, bad, name, while, identifying, with, socialism, he, opposed, forms, of, socialism, like, marxism, leninism, which, promoted, communism, being, critical, of, marxism, leninism, s, promotion, of, atheism, tutu, often, used, the, aphorism, that, african, communism, is, an, oxymoron, because, in, his, view, africans, are, intrinsically, spiritual, and, this, conflicts, with, the, atheistic, nature, of, marxism, he, was, critical, of, the, marxist, leninist, governments, in, the, soviet, union, and, eastern, bloc, comparing, the, way, that, they, treated, their, populations, with, the, way, that, the, national, party, treated, south, africans, in, 1985, he, stated, that, he, hated, marxism, leninism, with, every, fiber, of, my, being, although, sought, to, explain, why, black, south, africans, turned, to, it, as, an, ally, when, you, are, in, a, dungeon, and, a, hand, is, stretched, out, to, free, you, you, do, not, ask, for, the, pedigree, of, the, hand, owner, nelson, mandela, had, foregrounded, the, idea, of, ubuntu, as, being, of, importance, to, south, africa, s, political, framework, in, 1986, tutu, had, defined, ubuntu, it, refers, to, gentleness, to, compassion, to, hospitality, to, openness, to, others, to, vulnerability, to, be, available, to, others, and, to, know, that, you, are, bound, up, with, them, in, the, bundle, of, life, reflecting, this, view, of, ubuntu, tutu, was, fond, of, the, xhosa, saying, that, a, person, is, a, person, through, other, persons, tutu, was, attracted, to, anglicanism, because, of, what, he, saw, as, its, tolerance, and, inclusiveness, its, appeal, to, reason, alongside, scripture, and, tradition, and, the, freedom, that, its, constituent, churches, had, from, any, centralized, authority, tutu, s, approach, to, anglicanism, has, been, characterised, as, having, been, anglo, catholic, in, nature, he, regarded, the, anglican, communion, as, a, family, replete, with, its, internal, squabbles, tutu, rejected, the, idea, that, any, particular, variant, of, theology, was, universally, applicable, instead, maintaining, that, all, understandings, of, god, had, to, be, contextual, in, relating, to, the, socio, cultural, conditions, in, which, they, existed, in, the, 1970s, tutu, became, an, advocate, of, both, black, theology, and, african, theology, seeking, ways, to, fuse, the, two, schools, of, christian, theological, thought, unlike, other, theologians, like, john, mbiti, who, saw, the, traditions, as, largely, incompatible, tutu, emphasised, the, similarities, between, the, two, he, believed, that, both, theological, approaches, had, arisen, in, contexts, where, black, humanity, had, been, defined, in, terms, of, white, norms, and, values, in, societies, where, to, be, really, human, the, black, man, had, to, see, himself, and, to, be, seen, as, a, chocolate, coloured, white, man, he, also, argued, that, both, black, and, african, theology, shared, a, repudiation, of, the, supremacy, of, western, values, in, doing, so, he, spoke, of, an, underlying, unity, of, africans, and, the, african, diaspora, stating, that, all, of, us, are, bound, to, mother, africa, by, invisible, but, tenacious, bonds, she, has, nurtured, the, deepest, things, in, us, blacks, he, became, according, to, du, boulay, one, of, the, most, eloquent, and, persuasive, communicators, of, black, theology, he, expressed, his, views, on, theology, largely, through, sermons, and, addresses, rather, than, in, extended, academic, treatises, tutu, expressed, the, view, that, western, theology, sought, answers, to, questions, that, africans, were, not, asking, for, tutu, two, major, questions, were, being, posed, by, african, christianity, how, to, replace, imported, christian, expressions, of, faith, with, something, authentically, african, and, how, to, liberate, people, from, bondage, he, believed, that, there, were, many, comparisons, to, be, made, between, contemporary, african, understandings, of, god, and, those, featured, in, the, old, testament, he, nevertheless, criticised, african, theology, for, failing, to, sufficiently, address, contemporary, societal, problems, and, suggested, that, to, correct, this, it, should, learn, from, the, black, theology, tradition, when, chairing, the, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, tutu, advocated, an, explicitly, christian, model, of, reconciliation, as, part, of, which, he, believed, that, south, africans, had, to, face, up, to, the, damages, that, they, had, caused, and, accept, the, consequences, of, their, actions, as, part, of, this, he, believed, that, the, perpetrators, and, beneficiaries, of, apartheid, must, admit, to, their, actions, but, that, the, system, s, victims, should, respond, generously, stating, that, it, was, a, gospel, imperative, to, forgive, at, the, same, time, he, argued, that, those, responsible, had, to, display, true, repentance, in, the, form, of, restitution, gish, noted, that, by, the, time, of, apartheid, s, fall, tutu, had, attained, worldwide, respect, for, his, uncompromising, stand, for, justice, and, reconciliation, and, his, unmatched, integrity, according, to, allen, tutu, made, a, powerful, and, unique, contribution, to, publicizing, the, antiapartheid, struggle, abroad, particularly, in, the, united, states, in, the, latter, country, he, was, able, to, rise, to, prominence, as, a, south, african, anti, apartheid, activist, because, unlike, mandela, and, other, members, of, the, anc, he, had, no, links, to, the, south, african, communist, party, and, thus, was, more, acceptable, to, americans, amid, the, cold, war, anti, communist, sentiment, of, the, period, in, the, united, states, he, was, often, compared, to, martin, luther, king, jr, with, the, african, american, civil, rights, activist, jesse, jackson, referring, to, him, as, the, martin, luther, king, of, south, africa, after, the, end, of, apartheid, tutu, became, perhaps, the, world, s, most, prominent, religious, leader, advocating, gay, and, lesbian, rights, according, to, allen, ultimately, allen, thought, that, perhaps, tutu, s, greatest, legacy, was, the, fact, that, he, gave, to, the, world, as, it, entered, the, twenty, first, century, an, african, model, for, expressing, the, nature, of, human, community, during, tutu, s, rise, to, notability, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, responses, to, him, were, sharply, polarized, noting, that, he, was, simultaneously, loved, and, hated, honoured, and, vilified, du, boulay, attributed, his, divisive, reception, to, the, fact, that, strong, people, evoke, strong, emotions, tutu, gained, much, adulation, from, black, journalists, inspired, imprisoned, anti, apartheid, activists, and, led, to, many, black, parents, naming, their, children, after, him, for, many, black, south, africans, he, was, a, respected, religious, leader, and, a, symbol, of, black, achievement, by, 1984, he, was, according, to, gish, the, personification, of, the, south, african, freedom, struggle, in, 1988, du, boulay, described, him, as, a, spokesman, for, his, people, a, voice, for, the, voiceless, the, response, he, received, from, south, africa, s, white, minority, was, more, mixed, most, of, those, who, criticised, him, were, conservative, whites, who, did, not, want, a, shift, away, from, apartheid, and, white, minority, rule, many, of, these, whites, were, angered, that, he, was, calling, for, economic, sanctions, against, south, africa, and, that, he, was, warning, that, racial, violence, was, impending, said, whites, often, accused, him, of, being, a, tool, of, the, communists, this, hostility, was, exacerbated, by, the, government, s, campaign, to, discredit, tutu, and, distort, his, image, which, included, repeatedly, misquoting, him, to, present, his, statements, out, of, context, according, to, du, boulay, the, sabc, and, much, of, the, white, press, went, to, extraordinary, attempts, to, discredit, him, something, that, made, it, hard, to, know, the, man, himself, allen, noted, that, in, 1984, tutu, was, the, black, leader, white, south, africans, most, loved, to, hate, and, that, this, antipathy, extended, beyond, supporters, of, the, far, right, government, to, liberals, too, the, fact, that, he, was, an, object, of, hate, for, many, was, something, that, deeply, pained, him, hated, by, many, white, south, africans, for, being, too, radical, he, was, also, scorned, by, many, black, militants, for, being, too, moderate, on, tutu, in, the, mid, 1980s, by, steven, d, gish, 2004, tutu, also, drew, criticism, from, within, the, anti, apartheid, movement, and, the, black, south, african, community, he, was, criticised, repeatedly, for, making, statements, on, behalf, of, black, south, africans, without, consulting, other, community, leaders, first, some, black, anti, apartheid, activists, regarded, him, as, too, moderate, and, in, particular, too, focused, on, cultivating, white, goodwill, the, african, american, civil, rights, campaigner, bernice, powell, for, instance, complained, that, he, was, too, nice, to, white, people, according, to, gish, tutu, faced, the, perpetual, dilemma, of, all, moderates, he, was, often, viewed, suspiciously, by, the, two, hostile, sides, he, sought, to, bring, together, tutu, s, critical, view, of, marxist, oriented, communism, and, the, governments, of, the, eastern, bloc, and, the, comparisons, he, drew, between, these, administrations, and, far, right, ideologies, like, nazism, and, apartheid, brought, criticism, from, the, south, african, communist, party, in, 1984, after, the, transition, to, universal, suffrage, tutu, s, criticism, of, presidents, mbeki, and, zuma, brought, objections, from, their, supporters, in, 2006, zuma, s, personal, advisor, elias, khumalo, claimed, that, it, was, a, double, standard, that, tutu, could, accept, the, apology, from, the, apartheid, government, that, committed, unspeakable, atrocities, against, millions, of, south, africans, yet, cannot, find, it, in, his, heart, to, accept, the, apology, from, zuma, tutu, gained, many, international, awards, and, honorary, degrees, particularly, in, south, africa, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, by, 2003, he, had, approximately, 100, honorary, degrees, he, was, for, example, the, first, person, to, be, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, by, ruhr, university,

a, gesture, of, support, for, him, and, the, south, african, council, of, churches, which, he, led, at, that, time, in, 1987, tutu, was, awarded, the, pacem, in, terris, award, named, after, a, 1963,
