other, witnesses, including, rachmaninoff, s, wife, suggested, that, glazunov, an, alcoholic, may, have, been, drunk, following, the, reaction, to, his, first, symphony, rachmaninoff, wrote, in, may, 1897, that, i, m, not, at, all, affected, by, its, lack, of, success, or, critical, reaction, but, felt, deeply, distressed, and, heavily, depressed, by, the, fact, that, my, symphony, did, not, please, me, at, all, after, its, first, rehearsal, he, thought, its, performance, was, poor, particularly, glazunov, s, contribution, the, piece, was, not, performed, for, the, rest, of, rachmaninoff,

an, attempt, to, revive, his, desire, to, compose, his, aunt, arranged, for, the, writer, leo, tolstoy, whom, rachmaninoff, greatly, admired, to, have, the, composer, visit, his, home, and, receive, words, of, encouragement, the, visit, was, unsuccessful, doing, nothing, to, help, him, compose, with, the, fluency, he, had, before, by, 1900, rachmaninoff, had, become, so, self, critical, that,

final, meeting, in, july, 1917, the, nature, of, their, relationship, bordered, on, romantic, but, was, primarily, intellectual, and, emotional, shaginyan, and, the, poetry, she, shared, with, rachmaninoff, have, been, cited, as, the, inspiration, for, his, six, songs, op, 38, a, major, influence, on, rachmaninoff, as, a, composer, was, tchaikovsky, this, influence, can, be, seen, throughout, rachmaninoff, s, early, compositions, such, as, in, his, youth, symphony, which, is, reminiscent, of, tchaikovsky, s, late, symphonies, sections, of, his, symphonic, poem, prince, rostislav, which, emulates, the, tempest, and, romeo, and, juliet, and, his, youthful, three, nocturnes, the, third, of, which, contains, a, chordal, section, very, similar, to, the, opening, of, tchaikovsky, s, first, piano, concerto, his, first, opera, aleko, shows, the, influence, of, tchaikovsky, in, both, its, harmonies, and, in, its, allusions, and, references, to, eugene, onegin, tchaikovsky, was, also, particularly, influential, on, rachmaninoff, s, melodic, writing, though, musicologist, stephen, walsh, describes, rachmaninoff, s, melodies, as, lacking, the, range, or, length, of, tchaikovsky, s, the, influence, of, anton, arensky, who, taught, rachmaninoff, for, five, years, while, he, was, at, the, moscow, conservatory, can, be, seen, in, the, composer, s, early, compositions, this, influence, can, be, seen, for, example, in, his, symphonic, poem, prince, rostislav, dedicated, to, arensky, and, a, number, of, compositions, from, his, student, years, may, have, been, written, as, exercises, for, his, teacher, according, to, biographer, barrie, martyn, the, obviously, russian, character, and, tchaikovskian, lyricism, of, arensky, s, music, were, elements, which, were, also, part, of, rachmaninoff, s, compositional, style, sergei, taneyev, rachmaninoff, s, teacher, in, counterpoint, at, the, moscow, conservatory, was, also, an, influence, on, his, early, compositions, and, rachmaninoff, would, bring, his, compositions, to, taneyev, to, gain, his, approval, all, the, way, up, to, 1915, the, year, in, which, taneyev, died, in, his, later, style, the, influence, of, rimsky, korsakov, can, be, seen, in, the, increasingly, chromatic, harmonies, and, thinner, orchestration, in, rachmaninoff, s, compositions, from, his, third, piano, concerto,

minor, op, 44, 1935, 36, widely, spaced, chronologically, the, symphonies, represent, three, distinct, phases, in, his, compositional, development, the, second, has, been, the, most, popular, of, the, three, since, its, first, performance, among, rachmaninoff, s, other, orchestral, works, are, his, symphonic, dances, op, 45, his, last, major, composition, and, his, four, symphonic, poems, prince, rostislav, the, rock, op, 7, caprice, boh, mien, op, 12, and, the, isle, of, the, dead, op, 29, as, rachmaninoff, was, a, skilled, pianist, a, large, portion, of, his, compositional, output, consists, of, works, for, solo, piano, they, include, 24, preludes, traversing, all, 24, major, and, minor, keys, prelude, in, c, sharp, minor, op, 3, no, 2, from, morceaux, de, fantaisie, op, 3, ten, preludes, in, op, 23, and, thirteen, in, op, 32, especially, difficult, are, the, two, sets, of, tudes, tableaux, op, 33, and, 39, which, are, very, demanding, study, pictures, stylistically, op, 33, hearkens, back, to, the, preludes, while, op, 39, shows, the, influences, of, scriabin, and, prokofiev, there, are, also, the, six, moments, musicaux, op, 16, the, variations, on, a, theme, of, chopin, op, 22, and, the, variations, on, a, theme, of, corelli, op, 42, he, wrote, two, piano, sonatas, both, of, which, are, large, scale, and, virtuosic, in, their, technical, demands, rachmaninoff, also, composed, works, for, two, pianos, four, hands, including, two, suites, the, first, subtitled, fantasie, tableaux, a, version, of, the, symphonic, dances, op, 45, and, an, arrangement, of, the, c, sharp, minor, prelude, as, well, as, a, russian, rhapsody, and, he, arranged, his, first, symphony, below, for, piano, four, hands, both, these, works, were, published, posthumously, rachmaninoff, wrote, two, major, a, cappella, choral, works, the, liturgy, of, st, john, chrysostom, and, the, all, night, vigil, also, known, as, the, vespers, it, was, the, fifth, movement, of, all, night, vigil, that, rachmaninoff, requested, to, have, sung, at, his, funeral, other, choral, works, include, a, choral, symphony, the, bells, the, cantata, spring, the, three, russian, songs, and, an, early, concerto, for, choir, a, cappella, he, completed, three, one, act, operas, aleko, 1892, the, miserly, knight, 1903, and, francesca, da, rimini, 1904, he, started, three, others, notably, monna, vanna, based, on, the, work, by, maurice, maeterlinck, copyright, in, this, had, been, extended, to, the, composer, f, vrier, and, though, the, restriction, did, not, pertain, to, russia, rachmaninoff, dropped, the, project, after, completing, act, i, in, piano, vocal, score, in, 1908, aleko, is, regularly, performed, and, has, been, recorded, complete, at, least, eight, times, and, filmed, the, miserly, knight, adheres, to, pushkin, s, little, tragedy, francesca, da, rimini, was, described, by, the, composer, as, a, symphonic, opera, because, of, its, long, interludes, rachmaninoff, similarly, to, many, russian, composers, of, his, time, wrote, relatively, little, chamber, music, his, output, in, the, genre, includes, two, piano, trios, both, of, which, are, named, trio, el, giaque, the, second, of, which, is, a, memorial, tribute, to, tchaikovsky, a, cello, sonata, and, the, morceaux, de, salon, for, violin, and, piano, rachmaninoff, composed, a, total, of, 83, songs, rom, nsy, in, russian, for, voice, and, piano, all, of, which, were, written, before, he, left, russia, permanently, in, 1917, most, of, his, songs, were, set, to, texts, by, russian, romantic, writers, and, poets, such, as, alexander, pushkin, mikhail, lermontov, afanasy, fet, anton, chekhov, and, aleksey, tolstoy, among, others, his, most, popular, song, is, the, wordless, vocalise, which, he, later, arranged, for, orchestra, rachmaninoff, s, style, was, initially, influenced, by, tchaikovsky, by, the, mid, 1890s, however, his, compositions, began, showing, a, more, individual, tone, his, first, symphony, has, many, original, features, its, brutal, gestures, and, uncompromising, power, of, expression, were, unprecedented, in, russian, music, at, the, time, its, flexible, rhythms, sweeping, lyricism, and, stringent, economy, of, thematic, material, were, all, features, he, kept, and, refined, in, subsequent, works, following, the, poor, reception, of, the, symphony, and, three, years, of, inactivity, rachmaninoff, s, individual, style, developed, significantly, he, started, leaning, towards, broadly, lyrical, often, passionate, melodies, his, orchestration, became, subtler, and, more, varied, with, textures, carefully, contrasted, overall, his, writing, became, more, concise, especially, important, is, rachmaninoff, s, use, of, unusually, widely, spaced, chords, for, bell, like, sounds, this, occurs, in, many, pieces, most, notably, in, the, choral, symphony, the, bells, the, second, piano, concerto, the, e, flat, major, tude, tableaux, op, 33, no, 7, and, the, b, minor, prelude, op, 32, no, 10, it, is, not, enough, to, say, that, the, church, bells, of, novgorod, st, petersburg, and, moscow, influenced, rachmaninov, and, feature, prominently, in, his, music, this, much, is, self, evident, what, is, extraordinary, is, the, variety, of, bell, sounds, and, breadth, of, structural, and, other, functions, they, fulfill, he, was, also, fond, of, russian, orthodox, chants, he, used, them, most, perceptibly, in, his, vespers, but, many, of, his, melodies, found, their, origins, in, these, chants, the, opening, melody, of, the, first, symphony, is, derived, from, chants, the, opening, melody, of, the, third, piano, concerto, on, the, other, hand, is, not, derived, from, chants, when, asked, rachmaninoff, said, that, it, had, itself, rachmaninoff, s, frequently, used, motifs, include, the, dies, irae, often, just, the, fragments, of, the, first, phrase, rachmaninoff, had, great, command, of, counterpoint, and, fugal, writing, thanks, to, his, studies, with, taneyev, the, above, mentioned, occurrence, of, the, dies, irae, in, the, second, symphony, 1907, is, but, a, small, example, of, this, very, characteristic, of, his, writing, is, chromatic, counterpoint, this, talent, was, paired, with, a, confidence, in, writing, in, both, large, and, small, scale, forms, the, third, piano, concerto, especially, shows, a, structural, ingenuity, while, each, of, the, preludes, grows, from, a, tiny, melodic, or, rhythmic, fragment, into, a, taut, powerfully, evocative, miniature, crystallizing, a, particular, mood, or, sentiment, while, employing, a, complexity, of, texture, rhythmic, flexibility, and, a, pungent, chromatic, harmony, his, compositional, style, had, already, begun, changing, before, the, october, revolution, deprived, him, of, his, homeland, the, harmonic, writing, in, the, bells, was, composed, in, 1913, but, not, published, until, 1920, this, may, have, been, due, to, rachmaninoff, s, main, publisher, gutheil, having, died, in, 1914, and, gutheil, s, catalog, being, acquired, by, serge, koussevitsky, it, became, as, advanced, as, in, any, of, the, works, rachmaninoff, would, write, in, russia, partly, because, the, melodic, material, has, a, harmonic, aspect, which, arises, from, its, chromatic, ornamentation, further, changes, are, apparent, in, the, revised, first, piano, concerto, which, he, finished, just, before, leaving, russia, as, well, as, in, the, op, 38, songs, and, op, 39, tudes, tableaux, in, both, these, sets, rachmaninoff, was, less, concerned, with, pure, melody, than, with, coloring, his, near, impressionist, style, perfectly, matched, the, texts, by, symbolist, poets, the, op, 39, tudes, tableaux, are, among, the, most, demanding, pieces, he, wrote, for, any, medium, both, technically, and, in, the, sense, that, the, player, must, see, beyond, any, technical, challenges, to, a, considerable, array, of, emotions, then, unify, all, these, aspects, the, composer, s, friend, vladimir, wilshaw, noticed, this, compositional, change, continuing, in, the, early, 1930s, with, a, difference, between, the, sometimes, very, extroverted, op, 39, tudes, tableaux, the, composer, had, broken, a, string, on, the, piano, at, one, performance, and, the, variations, on, a, theme, of, corelli, op, 42, 1931, the, variations, show, an, even, greater, textural, clarity, than, in, the, op, 38, songs, combined, with, a, more, abrasive, use, of, chromatic, harmony, and, a, new, rhythmic, incisiveness, this, would, be, characteristic, of, all, his, later, works, the, piano, concerto, no, 4, op, 40, 1926, is, composed, in, a, more, emotionally, introverted, style, with, a, greater, clarity, of, texture, nevertheless, some, of, his, most, beautiful, nostalgic, and, melancholy, melodies, occur, in, the, third, symphony, rhapsody, on, a, theme, of, paganini, and, symphonic, dances, music, theorist, and, musicologist, joseph, yasser, as, early, as, 1951, uncovered, progressive, tendencies, in, rachmaninoff, s, compositions, he, uncovered, rachmaninoff, s, use, of, an, intra, tonal, chromaticism, that, stands, in, notable, contrast, to, the, inter, tonal, chromaticism, of, richard, wagner, and, strikingly, contrasts, the, extra, tonal, chromaticism, of, the, more, radical, twentieth, century, composers, like, arnold, schoenberg, yasser, postulated, that, a, variable, subtle, but, unmistakable, characteristic, use, of, this, intra, tonal, chromaticism, permeated, rachmaninoff, s, music, rachmaninoff, s, reputation, as, a, composer, generated, a, variety, of, opinions, before, his, music, gained, steady, recognition, around, the, world, the, 1954, edition, of, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, notoriously, dismissed, rachmaninoff, s, music, as, monotonous, in, texture, consist, mainly, of, artificial, and, gushing, tunes, and, predicted, that, his, popular, success, was, not, likely, to, last, to, this, harold, c, schonberg, in, his, lives, of, the, great, composers, responded, it, is, one, of, the, most, outrageously, snobbish, and, even, stupid, statements, ever, to, be, found, in, a, work, that, is, supposed, to, be, an, objective, reference, the, conservatoire, rachmaninoff, in, paris, as, well, as, streets, in, veliky, novgorod, which, is, close, to, his, birthplace, and, tambov, are, named, after, the, composer, in, 1986, the, moscow, conservatory, dedicated, a, concert, hall, on, its, premises, to, rachmaninoff, designating, the, 252, seat, auditorium, rachmaninoff, hall, and, in, 1999, the, monument, to, sergei, rachmaninoff, was, installed, in, moscow, a, separate, monument, to, rachmaninoff, was, unveiled, in, veliky, novgorod, near, his, birthplace, on, 14, june, 2009, the, 2015, musical, preludes, by, dave, malloy, depicts, rachmaninoff, s, struggle, with, depression, and, writer, s, block, a, statue, marked, rachmaninoff, the, last, concert, designed, and, sculpted, by, victor, bokarev, stands, at, the, world, s, fair, park, in, knoxville, tennessee, as, a, tribute, to, the, composer, in, alexandria, virginia, in, 2019, a, rachmaninoff, concert, performed, by, the, alexandria, symphony, orchestra, played, to, wide, acclaim, attendees, were, treated, to, a, talk, prior, to, the, performance, by, rachmaninoff, s, great, granddaughter, natalie, wanamaker, javier, who, joined, rachmaninoff, scholar, francis, crociata, and, library, of, congress, music, specialist, kate, rivers, on, a, panel, of, discussants, about, the, composer, and, his, contributions, rachmaninoff, ranked, among, the, finest, pianists, of, his, time, along, with, leopold, godowsky, ignaz, friedman, moriz, rosenthal, josef, lh, vinne, ferruccio, busoni, and, josef, hofmann, and, he, was, famed, for, possessing, a, clean, and, virtuosic, technique, his, playing, was, marked, by, precision, rhythmic, drive, notable, use, of, staccato, and, the, ability, to, maintain, clarity, when, playing, works, with, complex, textures, rachmaninoff, applied, these, qualities, in, music, by, chopin, including, the, b, flat, minor, piano, sonata, rachmaninoff, s, repertoire, excepting, his, own, works, consisted, mainly, of, standard, 19th, century, virtuoso, works, plus, music, by, bach, beethoven, borodin, debussy, grieg, liszt, mendelssohn, mozart, schubert, schumann, and, tchaikovsky, the, two, pieces, rachmaninoff, singled, out, for, praise, from, anton, rubinstein, s, concerts, became, cornerstones, for, his, own, recital, programs, the, compositions, were, beethoven, s, appassionata, and, chopin, s, funeral, march, sonata, he, may, have, based, his, interpretation, of, the, chopin, sonata, on, that, of, rubinstein, rachmaninoff, biographer, barrie, martyn, points, out, similarities, between, written, accounts, of, rubinstein, s, interpretation, and, rachmaninoff, s, audio, recording, of, the, work, rachmaninoff, possessed, large, hands, with, which, he, could, easily, maneuver, through, the, most, complex, chordal, configurations, his, left, hand, technique, was, unusually, powerful, his, playing, was, marked, by, definition, where, other, pianists, playing, became, blurry, sounding, from, overuse, of, the, pedal, or, deficiencies, in, finger, technique, rachmaninoff, s, textures, were, always, crystal, clear, only, josef, hofmann, and, josef, lh, vinne, shared, this, kind, of, clarity, with, him, all, three, men, had, anton, rubinstein, as, a, model, for, this, kind, of, playing, hofmann, as, a, student, of, rubinstein, s, rachmaninoff, from, hearing, his, famous, series, of, historical, recitals, in, moscow, while, studying, with, zverev, and, lh, vinne, from, hearing, and, playing, with, him, of, rachmaninoff, s, tone, arthur, rubinstein, wrote, i, was, always, under, the, spell, of, his, glorious, and, inimitable, tone, which, could, make, me, forget, my, uneasiness, about, his, too, rapidly, fleeting, fingers, and, his, exaggerated, rubatos, there, was, always, the, irresistible, sensuous, charm, not, unlike, kreisler, s, coupled, to, this, tone, was, a, vocal, quality, not, unlike, that, attributed, to, chopin, s, playing, with, rachmaninoff, s, extensive, operatic, experience, he, was, a, great, admirer, of, fine, singing, as, his, records, demonstrate, he, possessed, a, tremendous, ability, to, make, a, musical, line, sing, no, matter, how, long, the, notes, or, how, complex, the, supporting, texture, with, most, of, his, interpretations, taking, on, a, narrative, quality, with, the, stories, he, told, at, the, keyboard, came, multiple, voices, a, polyphonic, dialogue, not, the, least, in, terms, of, dynamics, his, 1940, recording, of, his, transcription, of, the, song, daisies, captures, this, quality, extremely, well, on, the, recording, separate, musical, strands, enter, as, if, from, various, human, voices, in, eloquent, conversation, this, ability, came, from, an, exceptional, independence, of, fingers, and, hands, regardless, of, the, music, rachmaninoff, always, planned, his, performances, carefully, he, based, his, interpretations, on, the, theory, that, each, piece, of, music, has, a, culminating, point, regardless, of, where, that, point, was, or, at, which, dynamic, within, that, piece, the, performer, had, to, know, how, to, approach, it, with, absolute, calculation, and, precision, otherwise, the, whole, construction, of, the, piece, could, crumble, and, the, piece, could, become, disjointed, this, was, a, practice, he, learned, from, russian, bass, feodor, chaliapin, a, staunch, friend, paradoxically, rachmaninoff, often, sounded, like, he, was, improvising, though, he, actually, was, not, while, his, interpretations, were, mosaics, of, tiny, details, when, those, mosaics, came, together, in, performance, they, might, according, to, the, tempo, of, the, piece, being, played, fly, past, at, great, speed, giving, the, impression, of, instant, thought, one, advantage, rachmaninoff, had, in, this, building, process, over, most, of, his, contemporaries, was, in, approaching, the, pieces, he, played, from, the, perspective, of, a, composer, rather, than, that, of, an, interpreter, he, believed, interpretation, demands, something, of, the, creative, instinct, if, you, are, a, composer, you, have, an, affinity, with, other, composers, you, can, make, contact, with, their, imaginations, knowing, something, of, their, problems, and, their, ideals, you, can, give, their, works, color, that, is, the, most, important, thing, for, me, in, my, interpretations, color, so, you, make, music, live, without, color, it, is, dead, nevertheless, rachmaninoff, also, possessed, a, far, better, sense, of, structure, than, many, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, hofmann, or, the, majority, of, pianists, from, the, previous, generation, judging, from, their, respective, recordings, a, recording, which, showcases, rachmaninoff, s, approach, is, the, liszt, second, polonaise, recorded, in, 1925, percy, grainger, who, had, been, influenced, by, the, composer, and, liszt, specialist, ferruccio, busoni, had, himself, recorded, the, same, piece, a, few, years, earlier, rachmaninoff, s, performance, is, far, more, taut, and, concentrated, than, grainger, s, the, russian, s, drive, and, monumental, conception, bear, a, considerable, difference, to, the, australian, s, more, delicate, perceptions, grainger, s, textures, are, elaborate, rachmaninoff, shows, the, filigree, as, essential, to, the, work, s, structure, not, simply, decorative, along, with, his, musical, gifts, rachmaninoff, possessed, physical, gifts, that, placed, him, in, good, stead, as, a, pianist, including, large, hands, with, a, gigantic, finger, stretch, cyril, smith, noted, that, rachmaninoff, could, play, a, twelfth, with, the, left, hand, playing, c, eb, g, c, and, g, and, his, right, hand, could, play, the, notes, c, index, e, thumb, g, c, and, e, his, hand, size, in, addition, to, his, considerable, height, slender, frame, long, limbs, narrow, head, prominent, ears, and, thin, nose, has, led, to, the, suggestion, that, he, may, have, had, marfan, syndrome, a, hereditary, disorder, of, the, connective, tissue, this, syndrome, would, have, accounted, for, several, minor, ailments, he, suffered, all, his, life, including, back, pain, arthritis, eye, strain, and, bruising, of, the, fingertips, an, article, in, the, journal, of, the, royal, society, of, medicine, however, pointed, out, that, rachmaninoff, did, not, show, many, of, the, typical, signs, of, marfan, syndrome, and, instead, suggested, that, he, may, have, had, acromegaly, which, the, article, speculated, would, possibly, have, accounted, for, stiffness, rachmaninoff, experienced, in, his, hands, and, for, the, repeated, periods, of, depression, he, experienced, throughout, his, life, and, could, have, possibly, even, been, connected, to, his, melanoma, upon, arriving, in, america, rachmaninoff, s, poor, financial, situation, prompted, him, in, 1919, to, record, a, selection, of, piano, pieces, for, edison, records, on, their, diamond, disc, records, in, a, limited, contract, for, ten, released, sides, rachmaninoff, felt, his, performances, varied, in, quality, and, requested, final, approval, prior, to, a, commercial, release, edison, agreed, but, still, issued, multiple, takes, an, unusual, practice, which, was, standard, at, edison, records, rachmaninoff, and, edison, records, were, pleased, with, the, released, discs, and, wished, to, record, more, but, edison, refused, saying, the, ten, sides, were, sufficient, this, in, addition, to, technical, issues, in, the, recordings, and, edison, s, lack, of, musical, taste, led, to, rachmaninoff, s, annoyance, with, the, company, and, as, soon, as, his, contract, ended, he, left, edison, records, in, 1920, rachmaninoff, signed, a, contract, with, the, victor, talking, machine, company, later, rca, victor, unlike, edison, the, company, was, pleased, to, comply, with, his, requests, and, proudly, advertised, rachmaninoff, as, one, of, their, prominent, recording, artists, he, continued, to, record, for, victor, until, 1942, when, the, american, federation, of, musicians, imposed, a, recording, ban, on, their, members, in, a, strike, over, royalty, payments, rachmaninoff, died, in, march, 1943, over, a, year, and, a, half, before, rca, victor, settled, with, the, union, and, resumed, commercial, recording, activity, when, rachmaninoff, recorded, his, works, he, would, seek, perfection, often, re, recording, them, until, he, was, satisfied, particularly, renowned, are, his, renditions, of, schumann, s, carnaval, and, chopin, s, piano, sonata, no, 2, along, with, many, shorter, pieces, he, recorded, all, four, of, his, piano, concertos, with, the, philadelphia, orchestra, the, first, third, and, fourth, concertos, were, recorded, with, eugene, ormandy, in, 1939, 41, and, two, versions, of, the, second, concerto, with, leopold, stokowski, in, 1924, and, 1929, he, also, made, a, recording, of, the, rhapsody, on, a, theme, of, paganini, soon, after, its, first, performance, 1934, with, the, philadelphians, under, stokowski, in, addition, to, three, recordings, he, made, as, conductor, with, the, philadelphia, orchestra, playing, his, own, third, symphony, his, symphonic, poem, isle, of, the, dead, and, his, orchestration, of, vocalise, rachmaninoff, also, recorded, a, number, of, piano, rolls, on, the, reproducing, piano, of, the, american, piano, company, ampico, producing, a, total, of, 35, piano, rolls, from, 1919, to, 1929, 12, of, which, were, of, his, own, compositions, he, began, recording, rolls, for, ampico, in, march, 1919, upon, the, suggestion, of, his, friend, fritz, kreisler, and, continued, doing, so, on, and, off, until, around, february, 1929, though, his, last, roll, of, chopin, s, scherzo, no, 2, was, not, published, until, october, 1933, of, the, works, he, produced, piano, rolls, for, 29, he, also, made, gramophone, recordings, of, and, these, provide, evidence, for, rachmaninoff, s, consistency, of, interpretation, in, addition, there, also, survives, an, unpublished, piano, roll, of, the, second, movement, of, his, second, piano, concerto, and, may, be, indicative, of, rachmaninoff, having, made, other, rolls, apart, from, several, performances, including, two, of, his, opera, aleko, in, 1893, rachmaninoff, first, began, conducting, in, 1897, and, performed, as, a, conductor, every, year, until, 1914, after, leaving, russia, permanently, in, 1917, rachmaninoff, prioritised, performing, as, a, pianist, to, conducting, giving, only, seven, more, recitals, as, a, conductor, until, the, end, of, his, life, rachmaninoff, was, noted, for, his, restraint, in, conducting, and, for, the, simple, and, unpolished, manner, in, which, he, gestured, to, the, orchestra, according, to, alexander, goldenweiser, his, performances, as, a, conductor, were, much, stricter, and, less, rhythmically, free, than, his, performances, on, the, piano, in, nikolai, medtner, s, estimation, he, was, the, greatest, russian, conductor, in, addition, to, his, own, works, rachmaninoff, conducted, repertoire, primarily, from, fellow, russian, composers, such, as, borodin, glazunov, glinka, lyadov, mussorgsky, rimsky, korsakov, and, tchaikovsky, as, well, as, other, composers, such, as, grieg, and, liszt, outside, of, russia, rachmaninoff, conducted, almost, exclusively, his, own, works, performances, and, recordings, music, scores, other, category
