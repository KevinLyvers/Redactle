such, as, politics, and, problems, with, society, latin, american, literary, scholar, raymond, l, williams, describes, this, phase, in, his, writing, career, as, the, discovery, of, humor, his, first,

and, documents, about, the, peruvian, armed, forces, and, a, corps, of, prostitutes, assigned, to, visit, military, outposts, in, remote, jungle, areas, these, plot, elements, are, similar, to, vargas, llosa, s, earlier, novel, the, green, house, but, in, a, different, form, captain, pantoja, and, the, special, service, is, therefore, essentially, a, parody, of, both, the, green, house, and, the, literary, approach, that, novel, represents, vargas, llosa, s, motivation, to, write, the, novel, came, from, actually, witnessing, prostitutes, being, hired, by, the, peruvian, army, and, brought, to, serve, soldiers, in, the, jungle, from, 1974, to, 1987, vargas, llosa, focused, on, his, writing, but, also, took, the, time, to, pursue, other, endeavors, in, 1975, he, co, directed, an,

account, exaggerates, many, negative, points, in, their, courtship, and, marriage, while, minimizing, her, role, of, assisting, his, literary, career, aunt, julia, and, the, scriptwriter, is, considered, one, of, the, most, striking, examples, of, how, the, language, and, imagery, of, popular, culture, can, be, used, in, literature, the, novel, was, adapted, in, 1990, into, a, hollywood, feature, film, tune, in, tomorrow, vargas, llosa, s, fourth, major, novel, the, war, of, the, end, of, the, world, la, guerra, del, fin, del, mundo, was, published, in, 1981, and, was, his, first, attempt, at, a, historical, novel, this, work, initiated, a, radical, change, in, vargas, llosa, s, style, towards, themes, such, as, messianism, and, irrational, human, behaviour, it, recreates, the, war, of, canudos, an, incident, in, 19th, century, brazil, in, which, an, armed, millenarian, cult, held, off, a, siege, by, the, national, army, for, months, as, in, vargas, llosa, s, earliest, work, this, novel, carries, a, sober, and, serious, theme, and, its, tone, is, dark, vargas, llosa, s, bold, exploration, of, humanity, s, propensity, to, idealize, violence, and, his, account, of, a, man, made, catastrophe, brought, on, by, fanaticism, on, all, sides, earned, the, novel, substantial, recognition, because, of, the, book, s, ambition, and, execution, critics, have, argued, that, this, is, one, of, vargas, llosa, s, greatest, literary, pieces, even, though, the, novel, has, been, acclaimed, in, brazil, it, was, initially, poorly, received, because, a, foreigner, was, writing, about, a, brazilian, theme, the, book, was, also, criticized, as, revolutionary, and, anti, socialist, vargas, llosa, says, that, this, book, is, his, favorite, and, was, his, most, difficult, accomplishment, after, completing, the, war, of, the, end, of, the, world, vargas, llosa, began, to, write, novels, that, were, significantly, shorter, than, many, of, his, earlier, books, in, 1983,

a, task, force, to, inquire, into, the, massacre, of, eight, journalists, at, the, hands, of, the, villagers, of, uchuraccay, the, commission, s, main, purpose, was, to, investigate, the, murders, in, order, to, provide, information, regarding, the, incident, to, the, public, following, his, involvement, with, the, investigatory, commission, vargas, llosa, published, a, series, of, articles, to, defend, his, position, in, the, affair, in, 1986, he, completed, his, next, novel, who, killed, palomino, molero, qui, n, mat, a, palomino, molero, which, he, began, writing, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, uchuraccay, investigation, though, the, plot, of, this, mystery, novel, is, similar, to, the, tragic, events, at, uchuraccay, literary, critic, roy, boland, points, out, that, it, was, not, an, attempt, to, reconstruct, the, murders, but, rather, a, literary, exorcism, of, vargas, llosa, s, own, experiences, during, the, commission, the, experience, also, inspired, one, of, vargas, llosa, s, later, novels, death, in, the, andes, lituma, en, los, andes, originally, published, in, 1993, in, barcelona, it, was, almost, 20, years, before, vargas, llosa, wrote, another, major, work,

most, ambitious, novel, since, the, war, of, the, end, of, the, world, critic, sabine, koellmann, sees, it, in, the, line, of, his, earlier, novels, such, as, conversaci, n, en, la, catedral, depicting, the, effects, of, authoritarianism, violence, and, the, abuse, of, power, on, the, individual, based, on, the, dictatorship, of, rafael, trujillo, who, governed, the, dominican, republic, from, 1930, until, his, assassination, in, 1961, the, novel, has, three, main, strands, one, concerns, urania, cabral, the, daughter, of, a, former, politician, and, trujillo, loyalist, who, returns, for, the, first, time, since, leaving, the, dominican, republic, after, trujillo, s, assassination, 30, years, earlier, the, second, concentrates, on, the, assassination, itself, the, conspirators, who, carry, it, out, and, its, consequences, and, the, third, and, final, strand, deals, with, trujillo, himself, in, scenes, from, the, end, of, his, regime, the, book, quickly, received, positive, reviews, in, spain, and, latin, america, and, has, had, a, significant, impact, in, latin, america, being, regarded, as, one, of, vargas, llosa, s, best, works, in, 2003, he, wrote, the, way, to, paradise, in, which, he, studies, flora, tristan, and, paul, gauguin, in, 2006, vargas, llosa, wrote, the, bad, girl, travesuras, de, la, ni, a, mala, which, journalist, kathryn, harrison, argues, is, a, rewrite, rather, than, simply, a, recycling, of, gustave, flaubert, s, madame, bovary, 1856, in, vargas, llosa, s, version, the, plot, relates, the, decades, long, obsession, of, its, narrator, a, peruvian, expatriate, in, paris, with, a, woman, with, whom, he, first, fell, in, love, when, both, were, teenagers, in, 2019, he, published, the, novel, tiempos, recios, harsh, times, about, the, 1954, coup, in, guatemala, like, many, other, latin, american, intellectuals, vargas, llosa, was, initially, a, supporter, of, the, cuban, revolutionary, government, of, fidel, castro, he, studied, marxism, in, depth, as, a, university, student, and, was, later, persuaded, by, communist, ideals, after, the, success, of, the, cuban, revolution, gradually, vargas, llosa, came, to, believe, that, socialism, was, incompatible, with, what, he, considered, to, be, general, liberties, and, freedoms, the, official, rupture, between, the, writer, and, the, policies, of, the, cuban, government, occurred, with, the, so, called, padilla, affair, when, the, castro, regime, imprisoned, the, poet, heberto, padilla, for, a, month, in, 1971, vargas, llosa, along, with, other, intellectuals, of, the, time, wrote, to, castro, protesting, the, cuban, political, system, and, its, imprisonment, of, the, artist, vargas, llosa, has, identified, himself, with, liberalism, rather, than, extreme, left, wing, political, ideologies, ever, since, since, he, relinquished, his, earlier, leftism, he, has, opposed, both, left, and, right, wing, authoritarian, regimes, with, his, appointment, to, the, investigatory, commission, on, the, uchuraccay, massacre, in, 1983, he, experienced, what, literary, critic, jean, franco, calls, the, most, uncomfortable, event, in, political, career, unfortunately, for, vargas, llosa, his, involvement, with, the, investigatory, commission, led, to, immediate, negative, reactions, and, defamation, from, the, peruvian, press, many, suggested, that, the, massacre, was, a, conspiracy, to, keep, the, journalists, from, reporting, the, presence, of, government, paramilitary, forces, in, uchuraccay, the, commission, concluded, that, it, was, the, indigenous, villagers, who, had, been, responsible, for, the, killings, for, vargas, llosa, the, incident, showed, how, vulnerable, democracy, is, in, latin, america, and, how, easily, it, dies, under, dictatorships, of, the, right, and, left, these, conclusions, and, vargas, llosa, personally, came, under, intense, criticism, anthropologist, enrique, mayer, for, instance, accused, him, of, paternalism, while, fellow, anthropologist, carlos, iv, n, degregori, criticized, him, for, his, ignorance, of, the, andean, world, vargas, llosa, was, accused, of, actively, colluding, in, a, government, cover, up, of, army, involvement, in, the, massacre, american, latin, american, literature, scholar, misha, kokotovic, summarizes, that, the, novelist, was, charged, with, seeing, indigenous, cultures, as, a, primitive, obstacle, to, the, full, realization, of, his, western, model, of, modernity, shocked, both, by, the, atrocity, itself, and, then, by, the, reaction, his, report, had, provoked, vargas, llosa, responded, that, his, critics, were, apparently, more, concerned, with, his, report, than, with, the, hundreds, of, peasants, who, later, died, at, the, hands, of, the, sendero, luminoso, guerrilla, organization, in, 1987, he, helped, form, and, soon, became, a, leader, of, the, center, right, party, movimiento, libertad, the, following, year, his, party,

fredemo, he, proposed, neoliberal, policies, similar, to, fujimori, that, included, a, drastic, economic, austerity, program, that, frightened, most, of, the, country, s, poor, this, program, emphasized, the, need, for, privatization, a, market, economy, free, trade, and, most, importantly, the, dissemination, of, private, property, vargas, llosa, according, to, rospigliosi, inspired, some, of, the, objectives, drafted, by, the, peruvian, armed, forces, in, plan, verde, specifically, in, the, volume, titled, driving, peru, into, the, xxi, century, which, outlined, peru, becoming, a, neoliberal, country, and, called, for, the, extermination, of, vulnerable, populations, deemed, as, economically, burdensome, members, of, the, peruvian, armed, forces, who, drafted, plan, verde, initially, expected, vargas, llosa, to, win, the, presidency, and, support, their, objectives, although, vargas, llosa, won, the, first, round, with, 34, of, the, vote, vargas, llosa, was, defeated,

great, as, my, gratitude, if, not, for, spain, i, never, would, have, reached, this, podium, or, become, a, known, writer, mario, vargas, llosa, served, as, a, visiting, professor, of, latin,

a, representative, of, vargas, llosa, said, the, writer, was, not, aware, of, the, ownership, of, that, company, idl, reporteros, provided, a, document, showing, vargas, llosa, s, signature, on, a, consent, to, act, as, director, form, for, melek, investing, inc, as, part, of, the, 2021, leak, vargas, llosa, s, style, encompasses, historical, material, as, well, as, his, own, personal, experiences, for, example, in, his, first, novel, the, time, of, the, hero, his, own, experiences, at, the, leoncio, prado, military, school, informed, his, depiction, of, the, corrupt, social, institution, which, mocked, the, moral, standards, it, was, supposed, to, uphold, furthermore, the, corruption, of, the, book, s, school, is, a, reflection, of, the, corruption, of, peruvian, society, at, the, time, the, novel, was, written, vargas, llosa, frequently, uses, his, writing, to, challenge, the, inadequacies, of, society, such, as, demoralization, and, oppression, by, those, in, political, power, towards, those, who, challenge, this, power, one, of, the, main, themes, he, has, explored, in, his, writing, is, the, individual, s, struggle, for, freedom, within, an, oppressive, reality, for, example, his, two, volume, novel, conversation, in, the, cathedral, is, based, on, the, tyrannical, dictatorship, of, peruvian, president, manuel, a, odr, a, the, protagonist, santiago, rebels, against, the, suffocating, dictatorship, by, participating, in, the, subversive, activities, of, leftist, political, groups, in, addition, to, themes, such, as, corruption, and, oppression, vargas, llosa, s, second, novel, the, green, house, explores, a, denunciation, of, peru, s, basic, institutions, dealing, with, issues, of, abuse, and, exploitation, of, the, workers, in, the, brothel, by, corrupt, military, officers, many, of, vargas, llosa, s, earlier, novels, were, set, in, peru, while, in, more, recent, work, he, has, expanded, to, other, regions, of, latin, america, such, as, brazil, and, the, dominican, republic, his, responsibilities, as, a, writer, and, lecturer, have, allowed, him, to, travel, frequently, and, led, to, settings, for, his, novels, in, regions, outside, of, peru, the, war, of, the, end, of, the, world, was, his, first, major, work, set, outside, peru, though, the, plot, deals, with, historical, events, of, the, canudos, revolt, against, the, brazilian, government, the, novel, is, not, based, directly, on, historical, fact, rather, its, main, inspiration, is, the, non, fiction, account, of, those, events, published, by, brazilian, writer, euclides, da, cunha, in, 1902, the, feast, of, the, goat, based, on, the, dictatorship, of, rafael, trujillo, takes, place, in, the, dominican, republic, in, preparation, for, this, novel, vargas, llosa, undertook, a, comprehensive, study, of, dominican, history, the, novel, was, characteristically, realist, and, vargas, llosa, underscores, that, he, respected, the, basic, facts, i, have, not, exaggerated, but, at, the, same, time, he, points, out, it, s, a, novel, not, a, history, book, so, i, took, many, many, liberties, one, of, vargas, llosa, s, more, recent, novels, the, way, to, paradise, el, para, so, en, la, otra, esquina, is, set, largely, in, tahiti, in, france, based, on, the, biography, of, former, social, reformer, flora, tristan, it, demonstrates, how, flora, and, paul, gauguin, were, unable, to, find, paradise, but, were, still, able, to, inspire, followers, to, keep, working, towards, a, socialist, utopia, unfortunately, vargas, llosa, was, not, as, successful, in, transforming, these, historical, figures, into, fiction, some, critics, such, as, barbara, mujica, argue, that, the, way, to, paradise, lacks, the, audacity, energy, political, vision, and, narrative, genius, that, was, present, in, his, previous, works, the, works, of, mario, vargas, llosa, are, viewed, as, both, modernist, and, postmodernist, novels, though, there, is, still, much, debate, over, the, differences, between, modernist, and, postmodernist, literature, literary, scholar, m, keith, booker, claims, that, the, difficulty, and, technical, complexity, of, vargas, llosa, s, early, works, such, as, the, green, house, and, conversation, in, the, cathedral, are, clearly, elements, of, the, modern, novel, furthermore, these, earlier, novels, all, carry, a, certain, seriousness, of, attitude, another, important, defining, aspect, of, modernist, art, by, contrast, his, later, novels, such, as, captain, pantoja, and, the, special, service, aunt, julia, and, the, scriptwriter, the, real, life, of, alejandro, mayta, and, the, storyteller, el, hablador, appear, to, follow, a, postmodernist, mode, of, writing, these, novels, have, a, much, lighter, farcical, and, comic, tone, characteristics, of, postmodernism, comparing, two, of, vargas, llosa, s, novels, the, green, house, and, captain, pantoja, and, the, special, service, booker, discusses, the, contrast, between, modernism, and, postmodernism, found, in, the, writer, s, works, while, both, novels, explore, the, theme, of, prostitution, as, well, as, the, workings, of, the, peruvian, military, booker, points, out, that, the, former, is, gravely, serious, whereas, the, latter, is, ridiculously, comic, literary, scholar, m, keith, booker, argues, that, vargas, llosa, perfects, the, technique, of, interlacing, dialogues, in, his, novel, the, green, house, by, combining, two, conversations, that, occur, at, different, times, he, creates, the, illusion, of, a, flashback, vargas, llosa, also, sometimes, uses, this, technique, as, a, means, of, shifting, location, by, weaving, together, two, concurrent, conversations, happening, in, different, places, this, technique, is, a, staple, of, his, repertoire, which, he, began, using, near, the, end, of, his, first, novel, the, time, of, the, hero, however, he, does, not, use, interlacing, dialogues, in, the, same, way, in, all, of, his, novels, for, example, in, the, green, house, the, technique, is, used, in, a, serious, fashion, to, achieve, a, sober, tone, and, to, focus, on, the, interrelatedness, of, important, events, separated, in, time, or, space, in, contrast, captain, pantoja, and, the, special, service, employs, this, strategy, for, comic, effects, and, uses, simpler, spatial, shifts, this, device, is, similar, to, both, virginia, woolf, s, mixing, of, different, characters, soliloquies, and, gustave, flaubert, s, counterpoint, technique, in, which, he, blends, together, conversation, with, other, events, such, as, speeches, this, was, seen, to, occur, yet, again, in, vargas, llosa, s, most, current, work, tiempos, recios, as, two, dialogues, one, between, trujillo, and, castillo, armas, and, another, between, trujillo, and, abbes, garc, a, are, juxtaposed, vargas, llosa, s, first, literary, influences, were, relatively, obscure, peruvian, writers, such, as, mart, n, ad, n, carlos, oquendo, de, amat, and, c, sar, moro, as, a, young, writer, he, looked, to, these, revolutionary, novelists, in, search, of, new, narrative, structures, and, techniques, in, order, to, delineate, a, more, contemporary, multifaceted, experience, of, urban, peru, he, was, looking, for, a, style, different, from, the, traditional, descriptions, of, land, and, rural, life, made, famous, by, peru, s, foremost, novelist, at, the, time, jos, mar, a, arguedas, vargas, llosa, wrote, of, arguedas, s, work, that, it, was, an, example, of, old, fashioned, regionalism, that, had, already, exhausted, its, imaginary, possibilities, although, he, did, not, share, arguedas, s, passion, for, indigenous, reality, vargas, llosa, admired, and, respected, the, novelist, for, his, contributions, to, peruvian, literature, indeed, he, has, published, a, book, length, study, on, his, work, la, utop, a, arcaica, 1996, rather, than, restrict, himself, to, peruvian, literature, vargas, llosa, also, looked, abroad, for, literary, inspiration, two, french, figures, existentialist, jean, paul, sartre, and, novelist, gustave, flaubert, influenced, both, his, technique, and, style, sartre, s, influence, is, most, prevalent, in, vargas, llosa, s, extensive, use, of, conversation, the, epigraph, of, the, time, of, the, hero, his, first, novel, is, also, taken, directly, from, sartre, s, work, flaubert, s, artistic, independence, his, novels, disregard, of, reality, and, morals, has, always, been, admired, by, vargas, llosa, who, wrote, a, book, length, study, of, flaubert, s, aesthetics, the, perpetual, orgy, in, his, analysis, of, flaubert, vargas, llosa, questions, the, revolutionary, power, of, literature, in, a, political, setting, this, is, in, contrast, to, his, earlier, view, that, literature, is, an, act, of, rebellion, thus, marking, a, transition, in, vargas, llosa, s, aesthetic, beliefs, other, critics, such, as, sabine, k, llmann, argue, that, his, belief, in, the, transforming, power, of, literature, is, one, of, the, great, continuities, that, characterize, his, fictional, and, non, fictional, work, and, link, his, early, statement, that, literature, is, fire, with, his, nobel, prize, speech, in, praise, of, reading, and, writing, one, of, vargas, llosa, s, favourite, novelists, and, arguably, the, most, influential, on, his, writing, career, is, the, american, william, faulkner, vargas, llosa, considers, faulkner, the, writer, who, perfected, the, methods, of, the, modern, novel, both, writers, styles, include, intricate, changes, in, time, and, narration, in, the, time, of, the, hero, for, example, aspects, of, vargas, llosa, s, plot, his, main, character, s, development, and, his, use, of, narrative, time, are, influenced, by, his, favourite, faulkner, novel, light, in, august, in, addition, to, the, studies, of, arguedas, and, flaubert, vargas, llosa, has, written, literary, criticisms, of, other, authors, that, he, has, admired, such, as, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, albert, camus, ernest, hemingway, and, jean, paul, sartre, the, main, goals, of, his, non, fiction, works, are, to, acknowledge, the, influence, of, these, authors, on, his, writing, and, to, recognize, a, connection, between, himself, and, the, other, writers, critic, sara, castro, klar, n, argues, that, he, offers, little, systematic, analysis, of, these, authors, literary, techniques, in, the, perpetual, orgy, for, example, he, discusses, the, relationship, between, his, own, aesthetics, and, flaubert, s, rather, than, focusing, on, flaubert, s, alone, since, distancing, himself, from, left, wing, politics, he, has, embraced, right, wing, politics, in, 1989, the, washington, post, would, write, that, though, vargas, llosa, s, party, appeared, center, right, he, has, ties, with, far, right, politicians, in, other, countries, vargas, llosa, has, continued, to, be, criticized, due, to, his, association, with, far, right, groups, and, politicians, the, christian, science, monitor, would, call, vargas, llosa, a, right, wing, maverick, while, jacobin, would, plainly, describe, him, as, a, far, right, novelist, vargas, llosa, has, described, himself, as, a, supporter, of, liberalism, and, said, that, the, individuals, who, have, had, most, impact, on, his, political, thought, have, included, karl, popper, friedrich, hayek, and, isaiah, berlin, according, to, the, nation, vargas, llosa, would, condemn, leftist, groups, entirely, due, to, the, controversies, of, some, while, minimizing, similar, actions, by, neoliberal, governments, he, supported, right, wing, libertarian, candidate, javier, milei, in, the, 2023, argentine, general, election, following, the, arrest, of, augusto, pinochet, for, crimes, against, humanity, in, 1999, vargas, llosa, would, write, an, op, ed, in, the, new, york, times, asking, why, left, wing, dictators, were, also, not, being, arrested, during, the, 2021, chilean, general, elections, vargas, llosa, expressed, support, for, conservative, presidential, candidate, jos, antonio, kast, during, the, 2022, brazilian, general, election, vargas, llosa, expressed, his, endorsement, for, conservative, leader, jair, bolsonaro, the, case, of, bolsonaro, it, s, a, hard, question, his, jokes, are, very, hard, to, endorse, for, a, liberal, now, between, bolsonaro, and, lula, i, prefer, bolsonaro, even, with, jokes, from, bolsonaro, lula, no, said, vargas, llosa, at, a, conference, a, month, after, losing, the, election, at, the, invitation, of, octavio, paz, vargas, llosa, attended, a, conference, in, mexico, entitled, the, 20th, century, the, experience, of, freedom, focused, on, the, collapse, of, communist, rule, in, central, and, eastern, europe, it, was, broadcast, on, mexican, television, from, 27, august, to, 2, september, addressing, the, conference, on, 30, august, 1990, vargas, llosa, embarrassed, his, hosts, by, condemning, the, mexican, system, of, power, based, on, the, rule, of, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, pri, which, had, been, in, power, for, 61, years, criticizing, the, pri, by, name, he, commented, i, don, t, believe, that, there, has, been, in, latin, america, any, case, of, a, system, of, dictatorship, which, has, so, efficiently, recruited, the, intellectual, milieu, bribing, it, with, great, subtlety, he, declared, mexico, is, the, perfect, dictatorship, the, perfect, dictatorship, is, not, communism, not, the, ussr, not, fidel, castro, the, perfect, dictatorship, is, mexico, because, it, is, a, camouflaged, dictatorship, the, statement, mexico, is, the, perfect, dictatorship, became, a, clich, in, mexico, and, internationally, until, the, pri, fell, from, power, in, 2000, in, april, 2011,

keiko, fujimori, daughter, of, president, of, peru, alberto, fujimori, during, her, candidacy, in, the, 2011, peruvian, general, election, vargas, llosa, said, the, worst, option, is, that, of, keiko, fujimori, because, it, means, the, legitimation, of, one, of, the, worst, dictatorships, that, peru, has, had, in, its, history, endorsing, and, calling, for, peruvian, voters, to, consider, left, wing, candidate, ollanta, humala, after, fujimori, announced, her, candidacy, for, the, 2016, peruvian, general, election, vargas, llosa, said, in, 2014, keiko, is, the, daughter, of, a, murderer,
