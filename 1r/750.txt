jeremy, bentham, b, n, m, 4, february, 1747, 8, o, s, 6, june, 1832, was, an, english, philosopher, jurist, and, social, reformer, regarded, as, the, founder, of, modern, utilitarianism, bentham, defined, as, the, fundamental, axiom, of, his, philosophy, the, principle, that, it, is, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, that, is, the, measure, of, right, and, wrong, he, became, a, leading, theorist, in, anglo, american, philosophy, of, law, and, a, political, radical, whose, ideas, influenced, the, development, of, welfarism, he, advocated, individual, and, economic, freedoms, the, separation, of, church, and, state, freedom, of, expression, equal, rights, for, women, the, right, to, divorce, and, in, an, unpublished, essay, the, decriminalising, of, homosexual, acts, he, called, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, capital, punishment, and, physical, punishment, including, that, of, children, he, has, also, become, known, as, an, early, advocate, of, animal, rights, though, strongly, in, favour, of, the, extension, of, individual, legal, rights, he, opposed, the, idea, of, natural, law, and, natural, rights, both, of, which, are, considered, divine, or, god, given, in, origin, calling, them, nonsense, upon, stilts, however, he, viewed, the, magna, carta, as, important, using, it, to, convey, that, the, treatment, of, convicts, in, australia, was, unlawful, bentham, was, also, a, sharp, critic, of, legal, fictions, bentham, s, students, included, his, secretary, and, collaborator, james, mill, the, latter, s, son, john, stuart, mill, the, legal, philosopher, john, austin, and, american, writer, and, activist, john, neal, he, had, considerable, influence, on, the, reform, of, prisons, schools, poor, laws, law, courts, and, parliament, itself, on, his, death, in, 1832, bentham, left, instructions, for, his, body, to, be, first, dissected, and, then, to, be, permanently, preserved, as, an, auto, icon, or, self, image, which, would, be, his, memorial, this, was, done, and, the, auto, icon, is, now, on, public, display, in, the, entrance, of, the, student, centre, at, university, college, london, ucl, because, of, his, arguments, in, favour, of, the, general, availability, of, education, he, has, been, described, as, the, spiritual, founder, of, ucl, however, he, played, only, a, limited, direct, part, in, its, foundation, bentham, was, born, on, 4, february, 1747, 8, o, s, in, houndsditch, london, to, attorney, jeremiah, bentham, and, alicia, woodward, widow, of, a, mr, whitehorne, and, daughter, of, mercer, thomas, grove, of, andover, his, wealthy, family, were, supporters, of, the, tory, party, he, was, reportedly, a, child, prodigy, he, was, found, as, a, toddler, sitting, at, his, father, s, desk, reading, a, multi, volume, history, of, england, and, he, began, to, study, latin, at, the, age, of, three, he, learnt, to, play, the, violin, and, at, the, age, of, seven, bentham, would, perform, sonatas, by, handel, during, dinner, parties, he, had, one, surviving, sibling, samuel, bentham, 1757, 1831, with, whom, he, was, close, he, attended, westminster, school, in, 1760, at, age, 12, his, father, sent, him, to, the, queen, s, college, oxford, where, he, completed, his, bachelor, s, degree, in, 1764, receiving, the, title, of, ma, in, 1767, he, trained, as, a, lawyer, and, though, he, never, practised, was, called, to, the, bar, in, 1769, he, became, deeply, frustrated, with, the, complexity, of, english, law, which, he, termed, the, demon, of, chicane, when, the, american, colonies, published, their, declaration, of, independence, in, july, 1776, the, british, government, did, not, issue, any, official, response, but, instead, secretly, commissioned, london, lawyer, and, pamphleteer, john, lind, to, publish, a, rebuttal, his, 130, page, tract, was, distributed, in, the, colonies, and, contained, an, essay, titled, short, review, of, the, declaration, written, by, bentham, a, friend, of, lind, which, attacked, and, mocked, the, americans, political, philosophy, in, 1786, and, 1787, bentham, travelled, to, krichev, in, white, russia, modern, belarus, to, visit, his, brother, samuel, who, was, engaged, in, managing, various, industrial, and, other, projects, for, prince, potemkin, it, was, samuel, as, jeremy, later, repeatedly, acknowledged, who, conceived, the, basic, idea, of, a, circular, building, at, the, hub, of, a, larger, compound, as, a, means, of, allowing, a, small, number, of, managers, to, oversee, the, activities, of, a, large, and, unskilled, workforce, bentham, began, to, develop, this, model, particularly, as, applicable, to, prisons, and, outlined, his, ideas, in, a, series, of, letters, sent, home, to, his, father, in, england, he, supplemented, the, supervisory, principle, with, the, idea, of, contract, management, that, is, an, administration, by, contract, as, opposed, to, trust, where, the, director, would, have, a, pecuniary, interest, in, lowering, the, average, rate, of, mortality, the, panopticon, was, intended, to, be, cheaper, than, the, prisons, of, his, time, as, it, required, fewer, staff, allow, me, to, construct, a, prison, on, this, model, bentham, requested, to, a, committee, for, the, reform, of, criminal, law, i, will, be, the, gaoler, you, will, see, that, the, gaoler, will, have, no, salary, will, cost, nothing, to, the, nation, as, the, watchmen, cannot, be, seen, they, need, not, be, on, duty, at, all, times, effectively, leaving, the, watching, to, the, watched, according, to, bentham, s, design, the, prisoners, would, also, be, used, as, menial, labour, walking, on, wheels, to, spin, looms, or, run, a, water, wheel, this, would, decrease, the, cost, of, the, prison, and, give, a, possible, source, of, income, the, ultimately, abortive, proposal, for, a, panopticon, prison, to, be, built, in, england, was, one, among, his, many, proposals, for, legal, and, social, reform, but, bentham, spent, some, sixteen, years, of, his, life, developing, and, refining, his, ideas, for, the, building, and, hoped, that, the, government, would, adopt, the, plan, for, a, national, penitentiary, appointing, him, as, contractor, governor, although, the, prison, was, never, built, the, concept, had, an, important, influence, on, later, generations, of, thinkers, twentieth, century, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, argued, that, the, panopticon, was, paradigmatic, of, several, 19th, century, disciplinary, institutions, bentham, remained, bitter, throughout, his, later, life, about, the, rejection, of, the, panopticon, scheme, convinced, that, it, had, been, thwarted, by, the, king, and, an, aristocratic, elite, philip, schofield, argues, that, it, was, largely, because, of, his, sense, of, injustice, and, frustration, that, he, developed, his, ideas, of, sinister, interest, that, is, of, the, vested, interests, of, the, powerful, conspiring, against, a, wider, public, interest, which, underpinned, many, of, his, broader, arguments, for, reform, on, his, return, to, england, from, russia, bentham, had, commissioned, drawings, from, an, architect, willey, reveley, in, 1791, he, published, the, material, he, had, written, as, a, book, although, he, continued, to, refine, his, proposals, for, many, years, to, come, he, had, by, now, decided, that, he, wanted, to, see, the, prison, built, when, finished, it, would, be, managed, by, himself, as, contractor, governor, with, the, assistance, of, samuel, after, unsuccessful, attempts, to, interest, the, authorities, in, ireland, and, revolutionary, france, he, started, trying, to, persuade, the, prime, minister, william, pitt, to, revive, an, earlier, abandoned, scheme, for, a, national, penitentiary, in, england, this, time, to, be, built, as, a, panopticon, he, was, eventually, successful, in, winning, over, pitt, and, his, advisors, and, in, 1794, was, paid, 2, 000, for, preliminary, work, on, the, project, the, intended, site, was, one, that, had, been, authorised, under, an, act, of, 1779, for, the, earlier, penitentiary, at, battersea, rise, but, the, new, proposals, ran, into, technical, legal, problems, and, objections, from, the, local, landowner, earl, spencer, other, sites, were, considered, including, one, at, hanging, wood, near, woolwich, but, all, proved, unsatisfactory, eventually, bentham, turned, to, a, site, at, tothill, fields, near, westminster, although, this, was, common, land, with, no, landowner, there, were, a, number, of, parties, with, interests, in, it, including, earl, grosvenor, who, owned, a, house, on, an, adjacent, site, and, objected, to, the, idea, of, a, prison, overlooking, it, again, therefore, the, scheme, ground, to, a, halt, at, this, point, however, it, became, clear, that, a, nearby, site, at, millbank, adjoining, the, thames, was, available, for, sale, and, this, time, things, ran, more, smoothly, using, government, money, bentham, bought, the, land, on, behalf, of, the, crown, for, 12, 000, in, november, 1799, from, his, point, of, view, the, site, was, far, from, ideal, being, marshy, unhealthy, and, too, small, when, he, asked, the, government, for, more, land, and, more, money, however, the, response, was, that, he, should, build, only, a, small, scale, experimental, prison, which, he, interpreted, as, meaning, that, there, was, little, real, commitment, to, the, concept, of, the, panopticon, as, a, cornerstone, of, penal, reform, negotiations, continued, but, in, 1801, pitt, resigned, from, office, and, in, 1803, the, new, addington, administration, decided, not, to, proceed, with, the, project, bentham, was, devastated, they, have, murdered, my, best, days, nevertheless, a, few, years, later, the, government, revived, the, idea, of, a, national, penitentiary, and, in, 1811, and, 1812, returned, specifically, to, the, idea, of, a, panopticon, bentham, now, aged, 63, was, still, willing, to, be, governor, however, as, it, became, clear, that, there, was, still, no, real, commitment, to, the, proposal, he, abandoned, hope, and, instead, turned, his, attentions, to, extracting, financial, compensation, for, his, years, of, fruitless, effort, his, initial, claim, was, for, the, enormous, sum, of, nearly, 700, 000, but, he, eventually, settled, for, the, more, modest, but, still, considerable, sum, of, 23, 000, the, penitentiary, house, etc, act, 1812, 52, geo, 3, c, 44, transferred, his, title, in, the, site, to, the, crown, more, successful, was, his, cooperation, with, patrick, colquhoun, in, tackling, the, corruption, in, the, pool, of, london, this, resulted, in, the, depredations, on, the, thames, act, 1800, 39, 40, geo, 3, c, 87, the, act, created, the, thames, river, police, which, was, the, first, preventive, police, force, in, the, country, and, was, a, precedent, for, robert, peel, s, reforms, 30, years, later, 67, 69, bentham, was, in, correspondence, with, many, influential, people, in, the, 1780s, for, example, bentham, maintained, a, correspondence, with, the, ageing, adam, smith, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, convince, smith, that, interest, rates, should, be, allowed, to, freely, float, as, a, result, of, his, correspondence, with, mirabeau, and, other, leaders, of, the, french, revolution, bentham, was, declared, an, honorary, citizen, of, france, he, was, an, outspoken, critic, of, the, revolutionary, discourse, of, natural, rights, and, of, the, violence, that, arose, after, the, jacobins, took, power, 1792, between, 1808, and, 1810, he, held, a, personal, friendship, with, latin, american, revolutionary, francisco, de, miranda, and, paid, visits, to, miranda, s, grafton, way, house, in, london, he, also, developed, links, with, jos, cecilio, del, valle, in, 1821, john, cartwright, proposed, to, bentham, that, they, serve, as, guardians, of, constitutional, reform, seven, wise, men, whose, reports, and, observations, would, concern, the, entire, democracy, or, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, describing, himself, among, the, names, mentioned, which, also, included, sir, francis, burdett, george, ensor, and, sir, matthew, wood, and, as, a, nonentity, bentham, declined, the, offer, on, 3, august, 1831, the, committee, of, the, national, colonization, society, approved, the, printing, of, its, proposal, to, establish, a, free, colony, on, the, south, coast, of, australia, funded, by, the, sale, of, appropriated, colonial, lands, overseen, by, a, joint, stock, company, and, which, would, be, granted, powers, of, self, government, as, soon, as, was, practicable, contrary, to, assumptions, bentham, had, no, hand, in, the, preparation, of, the, proposal, to, his, majesty, s, government, for, founding, a, colony, on, the, southern, coast, of, australia, which, was, prepared, under, the, auspices, of, robert, gouger, charles, grey, 2nd, earl, grey, and, anthony, bacon, bentham, did, however, in, august, 1831, draft, an, unpublished, work, entitled, colonization, company, proposal, which, constitutes, his, commentary, upon, the, national, colonization, society, s, proposal, in, 1823, he, co, founded, the, westminster, review, with, james, mill, as, a, journal, for, the, philosophical, radicals, a, group, of, younger, disciples, through, whom, bentham, exerted, considerable, influence, in, british, public, life, one, was, john, bowring, to, whom, bentham, became, devoted, describing, their, relationship, as, son, and, father, he, appointed, bowring, political, editor, of, the, westminster, review, and, eventually, his, literary, executor, another, was, edwin, chadwick, who, wrote, on, hygiene, sanitation, and, policing, and, was, a, major, contributor, to, the, poor, law, amendment, act, bentham, employed, chadwick, as, a, secretary, and, bequeathed, him, a, large, legacy, 94, bentham, had, several, infatuations, with, women, and, wrote, on, sex, he, never, married, an, insight, into, his, character, is, given, in, michael, st, john, packe, s, the, life, of, john, stuart, mill, during, his, youthful, visits, to, bowood, house, the, country, seat, of, his, patron, lord, lansdowne, he, had, passed, his, time, at, falling, unsuccessfully, in, love, with, all, the, ladies, of, the, house, whom, he, courted, with, a, clumsy, jocularity, while, playing, chess, with, them, or, giving, them, lessons, on, the, harpsichord, hopeful, to, the, last, at, the, age, of, eighty, he, wrote, again, to, one, of, them, recalling, to, her, memory, the, far, off, days, when, she, had, presented, him, in, ceremony, with, the, flower, in, the, green, lane, to, the, end, of, his, life, he, could, not, hear, of, bowood, without, tears, swimming, in, his, eyes, and, he, was, forced, to, exclaim, take, me, forward, i, entreat, you, to, the, future, do, not, let, me, go, back, to, the, past, a, psychobiographical, study, by, philip, lucas, and, anne, sheeran, argues, that, he, may, have, had, asperger, s, syndrome, bentham, s, daily, pattern, was, to, rise, at, 6, am, walk, for, 2, hours, or, more, and, then, work, until, 4, pm, the, faculty, of, laws, at, university, college, london, occupies, bentham, house, next, to, the, main, ucl, campus, bentham, s, name, was, adopted, by, the, australian, litigation, funder, imf, limited, to, become, bentham, imf, limited, on, 28, november, 2013, in, recognition, of, bentham, being, among, the, first, to, support, the, utility, of, litigation, funding, bentham, today, is, considered, as, the, father, of, utilitarianism, his, ambition, in, life, was, to, create, a, pannomion, a, complete, utilitarian, code, of, law, he, not, only, proposed, many, legal, and, social, reforms, but, also, expounded, an, underlying, moral, principle, on, which, they, should, be, based, this, philosophy, of, utilitarianism, took, for, its, fundamental, axiom, to, be, the, notion, that, it, is, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, that, is, the, measure, of, right, and, wrong, bentham, claimed, to, have, borrowed, this, concept, from, the, writings, of, joseph, priestley, although, the, closest, that, priestley, in, fact, came, to, expressing, it, was, in, the, form, the, good, and, happiness, of, the, members, that, is, the, majority, of, the, members, of, any, state, is, the, great, standard, by, which, every, thing, relating, to, that, state, must, finally, be, determined, bentham, was, a, rare, major, figure, in, the, history, of, philosophy, to, endorse, psychological, egoism, he, was, also, a, determined, opponent, of, religion, as, crimmins, observes, between, 1809, and, 1823, jeremy, bentham, carried, out, an, exhaustive, examination, of, religion, with, the, declared, aim, of, extirpating, religious, beliefs, even, the, idea, of, religion, itself, from, the, minds, of, men, bentham, also, suggested, a, procedure, for, estimating, the, moral, status, of, any, action, which, he, called, the, hedonistic, or, felicific, calculus, principle, of, utility, the, principle, of, utility, or, greatest, happiness, principle, forms, the, cornerstone, of, all, bentham, s, thought, by, happiness, he, understood, a, predominance, of, pleasure, over, pain, he, wrote, in, an, introduction, to, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, nature, has, placed, mankind, under, the, governance, of, two, sovereign, masters, pain, and, pleasure, it, is, for, them, alone, to, point, out, what, we, ought, to, do, as, well, as, to, determine, what, we, shall, do, on, the, one, hand, the, standard, of, right, and, wrong, on, the, other, the, chain, of, causes, and, effects, are, fastened, to, their, throne, they, govern, us, in, all, we, do, in, all, we, say, in, all, we, think, bentham, s, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, focuses, on, the, principle, of, utility, and, how, this, view, of, morality, ties, into, legislative, practices, his, principle, of, utility, regards, good, as, that, which, produces, the, greatest, amount, of, pleasure, and, the, minimum, amount, of, pain, and, evil, as, that, which, produces, the, most, pain, without, the, pleasure, this, concept, of, pleasure, and, pain, is, defined, by, bentham, as, physical, as, well, as, spiritual, bentham, writes, about, this, principle, as, it, manifests, itself, within, the, legislation, of, a, society, in, order, to, measure, the, extent, of, pain, or, pleasure, that, a, certain, decision, will, create, he, lays, down, a, set, of, criteria, divided, into, the, categories, of, intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and, extent, using, these, measurements, he, reviews, the, concept, of, punishment, and, when, it, should, be, used, as, far, as, whether, a, punishment, will, create, more, pleasure, or, more, pain, for, a, society, he, calls, for, legislators, to, determine, whether, punishment, creates, an, even, more, evil, offence, instead, of, suppressing, the, evil, acts, bentham, argues, that, certain, unnecessary, laws, and, punishments, could, ultimately, lead, to, new, and, more, dangerous, vices, than, those, being, punished, to, begin, with, and, calls, upon, legislators, to, measure, the, pleasures, and, pains, associated, with, any, legislation, and, to, form, laws, in, order, to, create, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, he, argues, that, the, concept, of, the, individual, pursuing, his, or, her, own, happiness, cannot, be, necessarily, declared, right, because, often, these, individual, pursuits, can, lead, to, greater, pain, and, less, pleasure, for, a, society, as, a, whole, therefore, the, legislation, of, a, society, is, vital, to, maintain, the, maximum, pleasure, and, the, minimum, degree, of, pain, for, the, greatest, number, of, people, in, his, exposition, of, the, felicific, calculus, bentham, proposed, a, classification, of, 12, pains, and, 14, pleasures, by, which, we, might, test, the, happiness, factor, of, any, action, for, bentham, according, to, p, j, kelly, the, law, provides, the, basic, framework, of, social, interaction, by, delimiting, spheres, of, personal, inviolability, within, which, individuals, can, form, and, pursue, their, own, conceptions, of, well, being, it, provides, security, a, precondition, for, the, formation, of, expectations, as, the, hedonic, calculus, shows, expectation, utilities, to, be, much, higher, than, natural, ones, it, follows, that, bentham, does, not, favour, the, sacrifice, of, a, few, to, the, benefit, of, the, many, law, professor, alan, dershowitz, has, quoted, bentham, to, argue, that, torture, should, sometimes, be, permitted, utilitarianism, was, revised, and, expanded, by, bentham, s, student, john, stuart, mill, who, sharply, criticised, bentham, s, view, of, human, nature, which, failed, to, recognise, conscience, as, a, human, motive, mill, considered, bentham, s, view, to, have, done, and, to, be, doing, very, serious, evil, in, mill, s, hands, benthamism, became, a, major, element, in, the, liberal, conception, of, state, policy, objectives, bentham, s, critics, have, claimed, that, he, undermined, the, foundation, of, a, free, society, by, rejecting, natural, rights, historian, gertrude, himmelfarb, wrote, the, principle, of, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, was, as, inimical, to, the, idea, of, liberty, as, to, the, idea, of, rights, bentham, s, hedonistic, theory, a, term, from, j, j, c, smart, is, often, criticised, for, lacking, a, principle, of, fairness, embodied, in, a, conception, of, justice, in, bentham, and, the, common, law, tradition, gerald, j, postema, states, no, moral, concept, suffers, more, at, bentham, s, hand, than, the, concept, of, justice, there, is, no, sustained, mature, analysis, of, the, notion, thus, some, critics, object, it, would, be, acceptable, to, torture, one, person, if, this, would, produce, an, amount, of, happiness, in, other, people, outweighing, the, unhappiness, of, the, tortured, individual, however, as, p, j, kelly, argued, in, utilitarianism, and, distributive, justice, jeremy, bentham, and, the, civil, law, bentham, had, a, theory, of, justice, that, prevented, such, consequences, bentham, s, opinions, about, monetary, economics, were, completely, different, from, those, of, david, ricardo, however, they, had, some, similarities, to, those, of, henry, thornton, he, focused, on, monetary, expansion, as, a, means, of, helping, to, create, full, employment, he, was, also, aware, of, the, relevance, of, forced, saving, propensity, to, consume, the, saving, investment, relationship, and, other, matters, that, form, the, content, of, modern, income, and, employment, analysis, his, monetary, view, was, close, to, the, fundamental, concepts, employed, in, his, model, of, utilitarian, decision, making, his, work, is, considered, to, be, an, early, precursor, of, modern, welfare, economics, bentham, stated, that, pleasures, and, pains, can, be, ranked, according, to, their, value, or, dimension, such, as, intensity, duration, certainty, of, a, pleasure, or, a, pain, he, was, concerned, with, maxima, and, minima, of, pleasures, and, pains, and, they, set, a, precedent, for, the, future, employment, of, the, maximisation, principle, in, the, economics, of, the, consumer, the, firm, and, the, search, for, an, optimum, in, welfare, economics, bentham, advocated, pauper, management, which, involved, the, creation, of, a, chain, of, large, workhouses, bentham, was, the, first, person, to, be, an, aggressive, advocate, for, the, codification, of, all, of, the, common, law, into, a, coherent, set, of, statutes, he, was, actually, the, person, who, coined, the, verb, to, codify, to, refer, to, the, process, of, drafting, a, legal, code, he, lobbied, hard, for, the, formation, of, codification, commissions, in, both, england, and, the, united, states, and, went, so, far, as, to, write, to, president, james, madison, in, 1811, to, volunteer, to, write, a, complete, legal, code, for, the, young, country, after, he, learned, more, about, american, law, and, realised, that, most, of, it, was, state, based, he, promptly, wrote, to, the, governors, of, every, single, state, with, the, same, offer, during, his, lifetime, bentham, s, codification, efforts, were, completely, unsuccessful, even, today, they, have, been, completely, rejected, by, almost, every, common, law, jurisdiction, including, england, however, his, writings, on, the, subject, laid, the, foundation, for, the, moderately, successful, codification, work, of, david, dudley, field, ii, in, the, united, states, a, generation, later, bentham, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, earliest, proponents, of, animal, rights, he, argued, and, believed, that, the, ability, to, suffer, not, the, ability, to, reason, should, be, the, benchmark, or, what, he, called, the, insuperable, line, if, reason, alone, were, the, criterion, by, which, we, judge, who, ought, to, have, rights, human, infants, and, adults, with, certain, forms, of, disability, might, fall, short, too, in, 1780, alluding, to, the, limited, degree, of, legal, protection, afforded, to, slaves, in, the, french, west, indies, by, the, code, noir, he, wrote, 309n, the, day, has, been, i, am, sad, to, say, in, many, places, it, is, not, yet, past, in, which, the, greater, part, of, the, species, under, the, denomination, of, slaves, have, been, treated, by, the, law, exactly, upon, the, same, footing, as, in, england, for, example, the, inferior, races, of, animals, are, still, the, day, may, come, when, the, rest, of, the, animal, creation, may, acquire, those, rights, which, never, could, have, been, witholden, from, them, but, by, the, hand, of, tyranny, the, french, have, already, discovered, that, the, blackness, of, the, skin, is, no, reason, a, human, being, should, be, abandoned, without, redress, to, the, caprice, of, a, tormentor, it, may, one, day, come, to, be, recognised, that, the, number, of, the, legs, the, villosity, of, the, skin, or, the, termination, of, the, os, sacrum, are, reasons, equally, insufficient, for, abandoning, a, sensitive, being, to, the, same, fate, what, else, is, it, that, should, trace, the, insuperable, line, is, it, the, faculty, of, reason, or, perhaps, the, faculty, of, discourse, but, a, full, grown, horse, or, dog, is, beyond, comparison, a, more, rational, as, well, as, a, more, conversable, animal, than, an, infant, of, a, day, or, a, week, or, even, a, month, old, but, suppose, the, case, were, otherwise, what, would, it, avail, the, question, is, not, can, they, reason, nor, can, they, talk, but, can, they, suffer, earlier, in, the, paragraph, bentham, makes, clear, that, he, accepted, that, animals, could, be, killed, for, food, or, in, defence, of, human, life, provided, that, the, animal, was, not, made, to, suffer, unnecessarily, bentham, did, not, object, to, medical, experiments, on, animals, providing, that, the, experiments, had, in, mind, a, particular, goal, of, benefit, to, humanity, and, had, a, reasonable, chance, of, achieving, that, goal, he, wrote, that, otherwise, he, had, a, decided, and, insuperable, objection, to, causing, pain, to, animals, in, part, because, of, the, harmful, effects, such, practices, might, have, on, human, beings, in, a, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, morning, chronicle, in, march, 1825, he, wrote, i, never, have, seen, nor, ever, can, see, any, objection, to, the, putting, of, dogs, and, other, inferior, animals, to, pain, in, the, way, of, medical, experiment, when, that, experiment, has, a, determinate, object, beneficial, to, mankind, accompanied, with, a, fair, prospect, of, the, accomplishment, of, it, but, i, have, a, decided, and, insuperable, objection, to, the, putting, of, them, to, pain, without, any, such, view, to, my, apprehension, every, act, by, which, without, prospect, of, preponderant, good, pain, is, knowingly, and, willingly, produced, in, any, being, whatsoever, is, an, act, of, cruelty, and, like, other, bad, habits, the, more, the, correspondent, habit, is, indulged, in, the, stronger, it, grows, and, the, more, frequently, productive, of, its, bad, fruit, i, am, unable, to, comprehend, how, it, should, be, that, to, him, to, whom, it, is, a, matter, of, amusement, to, see, a, dog, or, a, horse, suffer, it, should, not, be, matter, of, like, amusement, to, see, a, man, suffer, seeing, as, i, do, how, much, more, morality, as, well, as, intelligence, an, adult, quadruped, of, those, and, many, other, species, has, in, him, than, any, biped, has, for, some, months, after, he, has, been, brought, into, existence, nor, does, it, appear, to, me, how, it, should, be, that, a, person, to, whom, the, production, of, pain, either, in, the, one, or, in, the, other, instance, is, a, source, of, amusement, would, scruple, to, give, himself, that, amusement, when, he, could, do, so, under, an, assurance, of, impunity, bentham, said, that, it, was, the, placing, of, women, in, a, legally, inferior, position, that, made, him, choose, in, 1759, at, the, age, of, eleven, the, career, of, a, reformist, though, american, critic, john, neal, claimed, to, have, convinced, him, to, take, up, women, s, rights, issues, during, their, association, between, 1825, and, 1827, bentham, spoke, for, a, complete, equality, between, the, sexes, arguing, in, favour, of, women, s, suffrage, a, woman, s, right, to, obtain, a, divorce, and, a, woman, s, right, to, hold, political, office, the, c, 1785, essay, paederasty, offences, against, one, s, self, argued, for, the, liberalisation, of, laws, prohibiting, homosexual, sex, the, essay, remained, unpublished, during, his, lifetime, for, fear, of, offending, public, morality, some, of, bentham, s, writings, on, sexual, non, conformity, were, published, for, the, first, time, in, 1931, but, paederasty, was, not, published, until, 1978, bentham, does, not, believe, homosexual, acts, to, be, unnatural, describing, them, merely, as, irregularities, of, the, venereal, appetite, the, essay, chastises, the, society, of, the, time, for, making, a, disproportionate, response, to, what, bentham, appears, to, consider, a, largely, private, offence, public, displays, or, forced, acts, being, dealt, with, rightly, by, other, laws, when, the, essay, was, published, in, the, journal, of, homosexuality, in, 1978, the, abstract, stated, that, bentham, s, essay, was, the, first, known, argument, for, homosexual, law, reform, in, england, bentham, s, writings, in, the, early, 1790s, onwards, expressed, an, opposition, to, imperialism, his, 1793, pamphlet, emancipate, your, colonies, critiqued, french, colonialism, in, the, early, 1820s, he, argued, that, the, liberal, government, in, spain, should, emancipate, its, new, world, colonies, in, the, essay, plan, for, an, universal, and, perpetual, peace, bentham, argued, that, britain, should, emancipate, its, new, world, colonies, and, abandon, its, colonial, ambitions, he, argued, that, empire, was, bad, for, the, greatest, number, in, the, metropole, and, the, colonies, according, to, bentham, empire, was, financially, unsound, entailed, taxation, on, the, poor, in, the, metropole, caused, unnecessary, expansion, in, the, military, apparatus, undermined, the, security, of, the, metropole, and, were, ultimately, motivated, by, misguided, ideas, of, honour, and, glory, for, bentham, transparency, had, moral, value, for, example, journalism, puts, power, holders, under, moral, scrutiny, however, bentham, wanted, such, transparency, to, apply, to, everyone, this, he, describes, by, picturing, the, world, as, a, gymnasium, in, which, each, gesture, every, turn, of, limb, or, feature, in, those, whose, motions, have, a, visible, impact, on, the, general, happiness, will, be, noticed, and, marked, down, he, considered, both, surveillance, and, transparency, to, be, useful, ways, of, generating, understanding, and, improvements, for, people, s, lives, bentham, distinguished, among, fictional, entities, what, he, called, fabulous, entities, like, prince, hamlet, or, a, centaur, from, what, he, termed, fictitious, entities, or, necessary, objects, of, discourse, similar, to, kant, s, categories, such, as, nature, custom, or, the, social, contract, bentham, died, on, 6, june, 1832, aged, 84, at, his, residence, in, queen, square, place, in, westminster, london, he, had, continued, to, write, up, to, a, month, before, his, death, and, had, made, careful, preparations, for, the, dissection, of, his, body, after, death, and, its, preservation, as, an, auto, icon, as, early, as, 1769, when, bentham, was, 21, years, old, he, made, a, will, leaving, his, body, for, dissection, to, a, family, friend, the, physician, and, chemist, george, fordyce, whose, daughter, maria, sophia, 1765, 1858, married, jeremy, s, brother, samuel, bentham, a, paper, written, in, 1830, instructing, thomas, southwood, smith, to, create, the, auto, icon, was, attached, to, his, last, will, dated, 30, may, 1832, it, stated, my, body, i, give, to, my, dear, friend, dr, southwood, smith, to, be, disposed, of, in, a, manner, hereinafter, mentioned, and, i, direct, he, will, take, my, body, under, his, charge, and, take, the, requisite, and, appropriate, measures, for, the, disposal, and, preservation, of, the, several, parts, of, my, bodily, frame, in, the, manner, in, the, paper, annexed, to, this, my, will, and, at, the, top, of, which, i, have, written, auto, icon, the, skeleton, he, will, cause, to, be, put, together, in, such, a, manner, that, the, whole, figure, may, be, seated, in, a, chair, usually, occupied, by, me, when, living, in, the, attitude, in, which, i, am, sitting, while, engaged, in, thought, in, the, course, of, time, occupied, in, writing, i, direct, that, the, body, thus, prepared, shall, be, transferred, to, my, executor, he, will, cause, the, skeleton, to, be, clad, in, one, of, the, suits, of, black, occasionally, worn, by, me, the, body, so, clothed, together, with, the, chair, and, the, staff, in, my, later, years, borne, by, me, he, will, take, charge, of, and, for, containing, the, whole, apparatus, he, will, cause, to, be, prepared, an, appropriate, box, or, case, and, will, cause, to, be, engraved, in, conspicuous, characters, on, a, plate, to, be, affixed, thereon, and, also, on, the, labels, on, the, glass, case, in, which, the, preparations, of, the, soft, parts, of, my, body, shall, be, contained, my, name, at, length, with, the, letters, ob, followed, by, the, day, of, my, decease, if, it, should, so, happen, that, my, personal, friends, and, other, disciples, should, be, disposed, to, meet, together, on, some, day, or, days, of, the, year, for, the, purpose, of, commemorating, the, founder, of, the, greatest, happiness, system, of, morals, and, legislation, my, executor, will, from, time, to, time, cause, to, be, conveyed, in, the, room, in, which, they, meet, the, said, box, or, case, with, the, contents, therein, to, be, stationed, in, such, part, of, the, room, as, to, the, assembled, company, shall, seem, meet, queen, s, square, place, westminster, wednesday, 30, may, 1832, bentham, s, wish, to, preserve, his, dead, body, was, consistent, with, his, philosophy, of, utilitarianism, in, his, essay, auto, icon, or, the, uses, of, the, dead, to, the, living, bentham, wrote, if, a, country, gentleman, has, rows, of, trees, leading, to, his, dwelling, the, auto, icons, of, his, family, might, alternate, with, the, trees, copal, varnish, would, protect, the, face, from, the, effects, of, rain, on, 8, june, 1832, two, days, after, his, death, invitations, were, distributed, to, a, select, group, of, friends, and, on, the, following, day, at, 3, p, m, southwood, smith, delivered, a, lengthy, oration, over, bentham, s, remains, in, the, webb, street, school, of, anatomy, medicine, in, southwark, london, the, printed, oration, contains, a, frontispiece, with, an, engraving, of, bentham, s, body, partly, covered, by, a, sheet, afterward, the, skeleton, and, head, were, preserved, and, stored, in, a, wooden, cabinet, called, the, auto, icon, with, the, skeleton, padded, out, with, hay, and, dressed, in, bentham, s, clothes, from, 1833, it, stood, in, southwood, smith, s, finsbury, square, consulting, rooms, until, he, abandoned, private, practice, in, the, winter, of, 1849, 50, when, it, was, moved, to, 36, percy, street, the, studio, of, his, unofficial, partner, painter, margaret, gillies, who, made, studies, of, it, in, march, 1850, southwood, smith, offered, the, auto, icon, to, henry, brougham, who, readily, accepted, it, for, ucl, it, is, currently, kept, on, public, display, at, the, main, entrance, of, the, ucl, student, centre, it, was, previously, displayed, at, the, end, of, the, south, cloisters, in, the, main, building, of, the, college, until, it, was, moved, in, 2020, upon, the, retirement, of, sir, malcolm, grant, as, provost, of, the, college, in, 2013, however, the, body, was, present, at, grant, s, final, council, meeting, as, of, 2013, this, was, the, only, time, that, the, body, of, bentham, has, been, taken, to, a, ucl, council, meeting, there, is, a, persistent, myth, that, the, body, of, bentham, is, present, at, all, council, meetings, bentham, had, intended, the, auto, icon, to, incorporate, his, actual, head, mummified, to, resemble, its, appearance, in, life, southwood, smith, s, experimental, efforts, at, mummification, based, on, practices, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, new, zealand, and, involving, placing, the, head, under, an, air, pump, over, sulfuric, acid, and, drawing, off, the, fluids, although, technically, successful, left, the, head, looking, distastefully, macabre, with, dried, and, darkened, skin, stretched, tautly, over, the, skull, the, auto, icon, was, therefore, given, a, wax, head, fitted, with, some, of, bentham, s, own, hair, the, real, head, was, displayed, in, the, same, case, as, the, auto, icon, for, many, years, but, became, the, target, of, repeated, student, pranks, it, was, later, locked, away, in, 2020, the, auto, icon, was, put, into, a, new, glass, display, case, and, moved, to, the, entrance, of, ucl, s, new, student, centre, on, gordon, square, bentham, is, widely, associated, with, the, foundation, in, 1826, of, london, university, the, institution, that, in, 1836, became, university, college, london, though, he, was, 78, years, old, when, the, university, opened, and, played, only, an, indirect, role, in, its, establishment, his, direct, involvement, was, limited, to, his, buying, a, single, 100, share, in, the, new, university, making, him, just, one, of, over, a, thousand, shareholders, bentham, and, his, ideas, can, nonetheless, be, seen, as, having, inspired, several, of, the, actual, founders, of, the, university, he, strongly, believed, that, education, should, be, more, widely, available, particularly, to, those, who, were, not, wealthy, or, who, did, not, belong, to, the, established, church, in, bentham, s, time, membership, of, the, church, of, england, and, the, capacity, to, bear, considerable, expenses, were, required, of, students, entering, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, as, the, university, of, london, was, the, first, in, england, to, admit, all, regardless, of, race, creed, or, political, belief, it, was, largely, consistent, with, bentham, s, vision, there, is, some, evidence, that, from, the, sidelines, he, played, a, more, than, passive, part, in, the, planning, discussions, for, the, new, institution, although, it, is, also, apparent, that, his, interest, was, greater, than, his, influence, he, failed, in, his, efforts, to, see, his, disciple, john, bowring, appointed, professor, of, english, or, history, but, he, did, oversee, the, appointment, of, another, pupil, john, austin, as, the, first, professor, of, jurisprudence, in, 1829, the, more, direct, associations, between, bentham, and, ucl, the, college, s, custody, of, his, auto, icon, see, above, and, of, the, majority, of, his, surviving, papers, postdate, his, death, by, some, years, the, papers, were, donated, in, 1849, and, the, auto, icon, in, 1850, a, large, painting, by, henry, tonks, hanging, in, ucl, s, flaxman, gallery, depicts, bentham, approving, the, plans, of, the, new, university, but, it, was, executed, in, 1922, and, the, scene, is, entirely, imaginary, since, 1959, when, the, bentham, committee, was, first, established, ucl, has, hosted, the, bentham, project, which, is, progressively, publishing, a, definitive, edition, of, bentham, s, writings, ucl, now, endeavours, to, acknowledge, bentham, s, influence, on, its, foundation, while, avoiding, any, suggestion, of, direct, involvement, by, describing, him, as, its, spiritual, founder, bentham, was, an, obsessive, writer, and, reviser, but, was, only, able, on, rare, occasions, of, bringing, his, work, to, completion, and, publication, most, of, what, appeared, in, print, in, his, lifetime, was, prepared, for, publication, by, others, several, of, his, works, first, appeared, in, french, translation, prepared, for, the, press, by, tienne, dumont, for, example, theory, of, legislation, volume, 2, principles, of, the, penal, code, 1840, weeks, jordan, company, boston, some, made, their, first, appearance, in, english, in, the, 1820s, as, a, result, of, back, translation, from, dumont, s, 1802, collection, and, redaction, of, bentham, s, writing, on, civil, and, penal, legislation, on, his, death, bentham, left, manuscripts, amounting, to, an, estimated, 30, million, words, which, are, now, largely, held, by, university, college, london, s, special, collections, c, 60, 000, manuscript, folios, and, the, british, library, c, 15, 000, folios, university, college, london, also, holds, a, collection, of, c, 500, books, either, by, about, or, owned, by, jeremy, bentham, john, bowring, the, young, radical, writer, who, had, been, bentham, s, intimate, friend, and, disciple, was, appointed, his, literary, executor, and, charged, with, the, task, of, preparing, a, collected, edition, of, his, works, this, appeared, in, 11, volumes, in, 1838, 1843, bowring, based, much, of, his, edition, on, previously, published, texts, including, those, of, dumont, rather, than, bentham, s, own, manuscripts, and, elected, not, to, publish, bentham, s, works, on, religion, at, all, the, edition, was, described, by, the, edinburgh, review, on, first, publication, as, incomplete, incorrect, and, ill, arranged, and, has, since, been, repeatedly, criticised, both, for, its, omissions, and, for, errors, of, detail, while, bowring, s, memoir, of, bentham, s, life, included, in, volumes, 10, and, 11, was, described, by, sir, leslie, stephen, as, one, of, the, worst, biographies, in, the, language, nevertheless, bowring, s, remained, the, standard, edition, of, most, of, bentham, s, writings, for, over, a, century, and, is, still, only, partially, superseded, it, includes, such, interesting, writings, on, international, relations, as, bentham, s, a, plan, for, an, universal, and, perpetual, peace, written, 1786, 89, which, forms, part, iv, of, the, principles, of, international, law, in, 1952, 1954, werner, stark, published, a, three, volume, set, jeremy, bentham, s, economic, writings, in, which, he, attempted, to, bring, together, all, of, bentham, s, writings, on, economic, matters, including, both, published, and, unpublished, material, although, a, significant, achievement, the, work, is, considered, by, scholars, to, be, flawed, in, many, points, of, detail, and, a, new, edition, of, the, economic, writings, retitled, writings, on, political, economy, is, currently, in, course, of, publication, by, the, bentham, project, in, 1959, the, bentham, committee, was, established, under, the, auspices, of, university, college, london, with, the, aim, of, producing, a, definitive, edition, of, bentham, s, writings, it, set, up, the, bentham, project, to, undertake, the, task, and, the, first, volume, in, the, collected, works, of, jeremy, bentham, was, published, in, 1968, the, collected, works, are, providing, many, unpublished, works, as, well, as, much, improved, texts, of, works, already, published, to, date, 38, volumes, have, appeared, the, complete, edition, is, projected, to, total, 80, the, volume, of, laws, in, general, 1970, was, found, to, contain, many, errors, and, has, been, replaced, by, of, the, limits, of, the, penal, branch, of, jurisprudence, 2010, in, 2017, volumes,
