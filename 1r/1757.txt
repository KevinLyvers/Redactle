johannes, gensfleisch, zur, laden, zum, gutenberg, c, 1393, 1406, 3, february, 1468, was, a, german, inventor, and, craftsman, who, invented, the, movable, type, printing, press, though, movable, type, was, already, in, use, in, east, asia, gutenberg, s, invention, of, the, printing, press, enabled, a, much, faster, rate, of, printing, the, printing, press, later, spread, across, the, world, and, led, to, an, information, revolution, and, the, unprecedented, mass, spread, of, literature, throughout, europe, it, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, development, of, the, renaissance, reformation, and, humanist, movements, his, many, contributions, to, printing, include, the, invention, of, a, process, for, mass, producing, movable, type, the, use, of, oil, based, ink, for, printing, books, adjustable, molds, mechanical, movable, type, and, the, invention, of, a, wooden, printing, press, similar, to, the, agricultural, screw, presses, of, the, period, gutenberg, s, method, for, making, type, is, traditionally, considered, to, have, included, a, type, metal, alloy, and, a, hand, mould, for, casting, type, the, alloy, was, a, mixture, of, lead, tin, and, antimony, that, melted, at, a, relatively, low, temperature, for, faster, and, more, economical, casting, cast, well, and, created, a, durable, type, his, major, work, the, gutenberg, bible, was, the, first, printed, version, of, the, bible, and, has, been, acclaimed, for, its, high, aesthetic, and, technical, quality, gutenberg, is, often, cited, as, among, the, most, influential, figures, in, human, history, and, has, been, commemorated, around, the, world, to, celebrate, the, 500th, anniversary, of, his, birth, in, 1900, the, gutenberg, museum, was, founded, in, his, hometown, of, mainz, in, 1997, time, life, picked, gutenberg, s, invention, as, the, most, important, of, the, second, millennium, johannes, gutenberg, was, born, in, mainz, in, modern, day, germany, a, wealthy, city, along, the, rhine, between, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, his, exact, year, of, birth, is, unknown, on, the, basis, of, a, later, document, indicating, that, he, came, of, age, by, 1420, scholarly, estimates, have, ranged, from, 1393, to, 1406, the, year, 1400, is, commonly, assigned, to, gutenberg, for, the, sake, of, convenience, tradition, also, holds, his, birthdate, to, be, on, the, feast, day, of, saint, john, the, baptist, 24, june, since, children, of, the, time, were, often, named, after, their, birthday, s, patron, saint, there, is, no, verification, for, this, assumption, since, the, name, johannes, and, variants, such, as, johann, henne, hengin, and, henchen, was, widely, popular, at, the, time, in, full, johannes, gutenberg, s, name, was, johannes, gensfleisch, zur, laden, zum, gutenberg, with, laden, and, gutenberg, being, adopted, from, the, family, s, residences, in, mainz, the, latter, refers, to, the, hof, zum, gutenberg, a, large, and, now, destroyed, gothic, style, residence, inherited, by, gutenberg, s, father, gutenberg, probably, spent, his, earliest, years, at, the, manor, which, existed, beside, st, christoph, s, his, father, friele, gensfleisch, zur, laden, was, a, patrician, and, merchant, likely, in, the, cloth, trade, friele, later, served, among, the, master, of, the, accounts, for, the, city, and, was, a, m, nzerhausgenossenschaft, lit, minting, house, cooperative, a, part, of, the, mint, s, companionship, in, 1386, friele, married, his, second, wife, else, wyrich, the, daughter, of, a, shopkeeper, johannes, was, probably, the, youngest, of, the, couple, s, three, children, after, his, brother, friele, b, c, 1387, and, sister, else, b, c, 1390, 1397, scholars, commonly, assume, that, the, marriage, of, friele, to, else, who, was, not, of, patrician, lineage, complicated, gutenberg, s, future, because, of, his, mother, s, commoner, status, gutenberg, would, never, be, able, to, succeed, his, father, at, the, mint, according, to, the, historian, ferdinand, geldner, this, disconnect, may, have, disillusioned, him, from, high, society, and, encouraged, his, unusual, career, as, an, inventor, the, patrician, patrizier, class, of, mainz, the, gutenbergs, included, held, a, privileged, socioeconomic, status, and, their, efforts, to, preserve, this, put, them, into, frequent, conflict, with, the, younger, generations, of, guild, z, nfte, craftsmen, a, particularly, violent, conflict, arose, in, february, 1411, amid, an, election, dispute, and, at, least, 117, patricians, fled, the, conflict, in, august, friele, left, presumably, with, the, gutenberg, family, and, probably, stayed, in, the, nearby, eltville, since, else, had, inhered, a, house, on, the, town, walls, there, the, archbishop, mediated, a, peace, between, the, rival, parties, allowing, the, family, to, return, to, mainz, later, that, autumn, the, situation, remained, unstable, and, the, rise, of, hunger, riots, forced, the, gutenberg, family, to, leave, in, january, 1413, for, eltville, no, documents, survive, concerning, gutenberg, s, childhood, or, youth, the, biographer, albert, kapr, remarked, that, most, books, on, gutenberg, pass, over, this, period, with, the, remark, that, not, a, single, fact, is, known, as, the, son, of, a, patrician, education, in, reading, and, arithmetic, would, have, been, expected, a, knowledge, of, latin, a, prerequisite, for, universities, is, also, probable, though, it, is, unknown, whether, he, attended, a, mainz, parish, school, was, educated, in, eltville, or, had, a, private, tutor, gutenberg, may, have, initially, pursued, a, religious, career, as, was, common, with, the, youngest, sons, of, patricians, since, the, proximity, of, many, churches, and, monasteries, made, it, a, safe, prospect, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, attended, the, st, victor, s, south, of, mainz, near, weisenau, as, he, would, later, join, their, brotherhood, it, was, the, site, of, a, well, regarded, school, and, his, family, had, connections, there, though, his, actual, attendance, remains, speculative, he, is, assumed, to, have, studied, at, the, university, of, erfurt, where, there, is, a, record, of, the, enrollment, of, a, student, called, johannes, de, altavilla, in, 1418, altavilla, is, the, latin, form, of, eltville, am, rhein, nothing, is, now, known, of, gutenberg, s, life, for, the, next, fifteen, years, but, in, march, 1434, a, letter, by, him, indicates, that, he, was, living, in, strasbourg, where, he, had, some, relatives, on, his, mother, s, side, he, also, appears, to, have, been, a, goldsmith, member, enrolled, in, the, strasbourg, militia, in, 1437, there, is, evidence, that, he, was, instructing, a, wealthy, tradesman, on, polishing, gems, but, where, he, had, acquired, this, knowledge, is, unknown, in, 1436, 37, his, name, also, comes, up, in, court, in, connection, with, a, broken, promise, of, marriage, to, a, woman, from, strasbourg, ennelin, whether, the, marriage, actually, took, place, is, not, recorded, following, his, father, s, death, in, 1419, he, is, mentioned, in, the, inheritance, proceedings, what, was, written, to, me, about, that, marvelous, man, seen, at, frankfurt, entirely, true, i, have, not, seen, complete, bibles, but, only, a, number, of, quires, of, various, books, the, script, is, extremely, neat, and, legible, not, at, all, difficult, to, follow, would, be, able, to, read, it, without, effort, and, indeed, without, glasses, future, pope, pius, ii, in, a, letter, to, cardinal, carvajal, march, 1455, around, 1439, gutenberg, was, involved, in, a, financial, misadventure, making, polished, metal, mirrors, which, were, believed, to, capture, holy, light, from, religious, relics, for, sale, to, pilgrims, to, aachen, in, 1439, the, city, was, planning, to, exhibit, its, collection, of, relics, from, emperor, charlemagne, but, the, event, was, delayed, by, one, year, due, to, a, severe, flood, and, the, capital, already, spent, could, not, be, repaid, until, at, least, 1444, gutenberg, lived, in, strasbourg, most, likely, in, the, st, arbogast, parish, it, was, in, strasbourg, in, 1440, that, he, is, said, to, have, perfected, and, unveiled, the, secret, of, printing, based, on, his, research, mysteriously, entitled, aventur, und, kunst, enterprise, and, art, it, is, not, clear, what, work, he, was, engaged, in, or, whether, some, early, trials, with, printing, from, movable, type, were, conducted, there, after, this, there, is, a, gap, of, four, years, in, the, record, in, 1448, he, was, back, in, mainz, where, he, took, out, a, loan, from, his, brother, in, law, arnold, gelthus, possibly, for, a, printing, press, or, related, paraphernalia, by, this, date, gutenberg, may, have, been, familiar, with, intaglio, printing, it, is, claimed, that, he, had, worked, on, copper, engravings, with, an, artist, known, as, the, master, of, playing, cards, by, 1450, the, press, was, in, operation, and, a, german, poem, had, been, printed, possibly, the, first, item, to, be, printed, there, gutenberg, was, able, to, convince, the, wealthy, moneylender, johann, fust, for, a, loan, of, 800, guilders, peter, sch, ffer, who, became, fust, s, son, in, law, also, joined, the, enterprise, sch, ffer, had, worked, as, a, scribe, in, paris, and, is, believed, to, have, designed, some, of, the, first, typefaces, gutenberg, s, workshop, was, set, up, at, humbrechthof, a, property, belonging, to, a, distant, relative, it, is, not, clear, when, gutenberg, conceived, the, bible, project, but, for, this, he, borrowed, another, 800, guilders, from, fust, and, work, commenced, in, 1452, at, the, same, time, the, press, was, also, printing, other, more, lucrative, texts, possibly, latin, grammars, there, is, also, some, speculation, that, there, were, two, presses, one, for, the, pedestrian, texts, and, one, for, the, bible, one, of, the, profit, making, enterprises, of, the, new, press, was, the, printing, of, thousands, of, indulgences, for, the, church, documented, from, 1454, to, 1455, in, 1455, gutenberg, completed, his, 42, line, bible, known, as, the, gutenberg, bible, about, 180, copies, were, printed, three, quarters, on, paper, and, the, rest, on, vellum, some, time, in, 1456, there, was, a, dispute, between, gutenberg, and, fust, in, which, fust, demanded, his, money, back, and, accused, gutenberg, of, misusing, the, funds, gutenberg, s, two, rounds, of, financing, from, fust, totaling, 1, 600, guilders, at, 6, interest, now, amounted, to, 2, 026, guilders, fust, sued, at, the, archbishop, s, court, a, legal, document, from, november, 1455, records, that, there, was, a, partnership, for, a, project, of, the, books, the, funds, for, which, gutenberg, had, used, for, other, purposes, according, to, fust, the, court, decided, in, favor, of, fust, giving, him, control, over, the, bible, printing, workshop, thus, gutenberg, was, effectively, bankrupt, but, it, appears, he, retained, or, restarted, a, printing, shop, and, participated, in, the, printing, of, a, bible, in, the, town, of, bamberg, around, 1459, for, which, he, seems, at, least, to, have, supplied, the, type, but, since, his, printed, books, never, carry, his, name, or, a, date, it, is, difficult, to, be, certain, it, is, possible, the, large, catholicon, dictionary, printed, in, mainz, in, 1460, or, later, was, executed, in, his, workshop, but, there, has, been, considerable, scholarly, debate, meanwhile, the, fust, sch, ffer, shop, was, the, first, in, europe, to, bring, out, a, book, with, the, printer, s, name, and, date, the, mainz, psalter, of, august, 1457, and, while, proclaiming, the, mechanical, process, by, which, it, had, been, produced, it, made, no, mention, of, gutenberg, in, 1462, during, the, devastating, mainz, diocesan, feud, mainz, was, sacked, by, archbishop, adolph, von, nassau, on, 18, january, 1465, gutenberg, s, achievements, were, recognized, by, archbishop, von, nassau, he, was, given, the, title, hofmann, gentleman, of, the, court, this, honor, included, a, stipend, and, an, annual, court, outfit, as, well, as, 2, 180, litres, of, grain, and, 2, 000, litres, of, wine, tax, free, gutenberg, died, in, 1468, and, was, buried, likely, as, a, tertiary, in, the, franciscan, church, at, mainz, this, church, and, the, cemetery, were, later, destroyed, and, gutenberg, s, grave, is, now, lost, in, 1504, he, was, mentioned, as, the, inventor, of, typography, in, a, book, by, professor, ivo, wittig, it, was, not, until, 1567, that, the, first, portrait, of, gutenberg, almost, certainly, an, imaginary, reconstruction, appeared, in, heinrich, pantaleon, s, biography, of, famous, germans, gutenberg, s, early, printing, process, and, what, texts, he, printed, with, movable, type, are, not, known, in, great, detail, his, later, bibles, were, printed, in, such, a, way, as, to, have, required, large, quantities, of, type, some, estimates, suggesting, as, many, as, 100, 000, individual, sorts, setting, each, page, would, take, perhaps, half, a, day, and, considering, all, the, work, in, loading, the, press, inking, the, type, pulling, the, impressions, hanging, up, the, sheets, distributing, the, type, etc, the, gutenberg, fust, shop, may, have, employed, many, craftsmen, gutenberg, s, technique, of, making, movable, type, remains, unclear, in, the, following, decades, punches, and, copper, matrices, became, standardized, in, the, rapidly, disseminating, printing, presses, across, europe, whether, gutenberg, used, this, sophisticated, technique, or, a, somewhat, primitive, version, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, debate, in, the, standard, process, of, making, type, a, hard, metal, punch, made, by, punchcutting, with, the, letter, carved, back, to, front, is, hammered, into, a, softer, copper, bar, creating, a, matrix, this, is, then, placed, into, a, hand, held, mould, and, a, piece, of, type, or, sort, is, cast, by, filling, the, mould, with, molten, type, metal, this, cools, almost, at, once, and, the, resulting, piece, of, type, can, be, removed, from, the, mould, the, matrix, can, be, reused, to, create, hundreds, or, thousands, of, identical, sorts, so, that, the, same, character, appearing, anywhere, within, the, book, will, appear, very, uniform, giving, rise, over, time, to, the, development, of, distinct, styles, of, typefaces, or, fonts, after, casting, the, sorts, are, arranged, into, type, cases, and, used, to, make, up, pages, which, are, inked, and, printed, a, procedure, which, can, be, repeated, hundreds, or, thousands, of, times, the, sorts, can, be, reused, in, any, combination, earning, the, process, the, name, of, movable, type, the, invention, of, the, making, of, types, with, punch, matrix, and, mold, has, been, widely, attributed, to, gutenberg, however, recent, evidence, suggests, that, gutenberg, s, process, was, somewhat, different, if, he, used, the, punch, and, matrix, approach, all, his, letters, should, have, been, nearly, identical, with, some, variation, due, to, miscasting, and, inking, however, the, type, used, in, gutenberg, s, earliest, work, shows, other, variations, in, 2001, the, physicist, blaise, ag, era, y, arcas, and, princeton, librarian, paul, needham, used, digital, scans, of, a, papal, bull, in, the, scheide, library, princeton, to, carefully, compare, the, same, letters, types, appearing, in, different, parts, of, the, printed, text, gutenberg, s, type, had, irregularities, particularly, in, simple, characters, like, the, hyphen, these, variations, could, not, have, been, caused, by, ink, smears, or, wear, on, the, metal, pieces, detailed, image, analysis, suggests, the, variations, could, not, have, come, from, the, same, matrix, examination, of, transmitted, light, pictures, of, the, page, revealed, substructures, in, the, type, that, could, not, have, been, made, using, traditional, punchcutting, techniques, based, on, these, observations, researchers, hypothesized, that, gutenberg, s, method, involved, impressing, simple, shapes, in, a, cuneiform, style, onto, a, matrix, made, of, a, soft, material, such, as, sand, casting, the, type, would, then, destroy, the, mold, necessitating, the, recreation, of, the, matrix, for, each, additional, sort, this, hypothesis, could, potentially, explain, both, the, variations, in, the, type, and, the, substructures, observed, in, the, printed, images, thus, they, speculated, that, the, decisive, factor, for, the, birth, of, typography, the, use, of, reusable, moulds, for, casting, type, was, a, more, progressive, process, than, was, previously, thought, they, suggested, that, the, additional, step, of, using, the, punch, to, create, a, mould, that, could, be, reused, many, times, was, not, taken, until, twenty, years, later, in, the, 1470s, others, have, not, accepted, some, or, all, of, their, suggestions, and, have, interpreted, the, evidence, in, other, ways, and, the, truth, of, the, matter, remains, uncertain, a, 1568, book, batavia, by, hadrianus, junius, from, holland, claims, the, idea, of, the, movable, type, came, to, gutenberg, from, laurens, janszoon, coster, via, fust, who, was, apprenticed, to, coster, in, the, 1430s, and, may, have, brought, some, of, his, equipment, from, haarlem, to, mainz, while, coster, appears, to, have, experimented, with, moulds, and, castable, metal, type, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, had, actually, printed, anything, with, this, technology, he, was, an, inventor, and, a, goldsmith, however, there, is, one, indirect, supporter, of, the, claim, that, coster, might, be, the, inventor, the, author, of, the, cologne, chronicle, of, 1499, quotes, ulrich, zell, the, first, printer, of, cologne, that, printing, was, performed, in, mainz, in, 1450, but, that, some, type, of, printing, of, lower, quality, had, previously, occurred, in, the, netherlands, however, the, chronicle, does, not, mention, the, name, of, coster, while, it, actually, credits, gutenberg, as, the, first, inventor, of, printing, in, the, very, same, passage, fol, 312, the, first, securely, dated, book, by, dutch, printers, is, from, 1471, and, the, coster, connection, is, today, regarded, as, a, mere, legend, the, 19th, century, printer, and, typefounder, fournier, le, jeune, suggested, that, gutenberg, was, not, using, type, cast, with, a, reusable, matrix, but, wooden, types, that, were, carved, individually, a, similar, suggestion, was, made, by, nash, in, 2004, between, 1450, 55, gutenberg, printed, several, texts, some, of, which, remain, unidentified, his, texts, did, not, bear, the, printer, s, name, or, date, so, attribution, is, possible, only, from, typographical, evidence, and, external, references, certainly, church, documents, including, a, papal, letter, and, two, indulgences, were, printed, one, of, which, was, issued, in, mainz, in, view, of, the, value, of, printing, in, quantity, seven, editions, in, two, styles, were, ordered, resulting, in, several, thousand, copies, being, printed, some, printed, editions, of, ars, minor, a, schoolbook, on, latin, grammar, by, aelius, donatus, may, have, been, printed, by, gutenberg, these, have, been, dated, either, 1451, 52, or, 1455, every, copy, of, printed, books, were, identical, this, was, a, significant, departure, from, handwritten, manuscripts, which, left, room, for, possible, human, error, in, 1455, gutenberg, completed, copies, of, a, well, executed, folio, bible, biblia, sacra, with, 42, lines, on, each, page, copies, sold, for, 30, florins, each, roughly, three, years, wages, for, a, clerk, nonetheless, it, was, much, cheaper, than, a, manuscript, bible, that, could, take, a, single, scribe, over, a, year, to, prepare, after, printing, some, copies, were, rubricated, or, hand, illuminated, in, the, same, elegant, way, as, manuscript, bibles, from, the, same, period, 48, substantially, complete, copies, are, known, to, survive, including, two, at, the, british, library, that, can, be, viewed, and, compared, online, the, text, lacks, modern, features, such, as, page, numbers, indentations, and, paragraph, breaks, an, undated, 36, line, edition, of, the, bible, was, printed, probably, in, bamberg, in, 1458, 60, possibly, by, gutenberg, a, large, part, of, it, was, shown, to, have, been, set, from, a, copy, of, gutenberg, s, bible, thus, disproving, earlier, speculation, that, it, was, the, earlier, of, the, two, what, the, world, is, today, good, and, bad, it, owes, to, gutenberg, everything, can, be, traced, to, this, source, but, we, are, bound, to, bring, him, homage, for, the, bad, that, his, colossal, invention, has, brought, about, is, overshadowed, a, thousand, times, by, the, good, with, which, mankind, has, been, favored, american, writer, mark, twain, 1835, 1910, gutenberg, s, invention, had, an, enormous, impact, on, subsequent, human, history, both, on, cultural, and, social, matters, his, design, directly, impacted, the, mass, spread, of, books, across, europe, causing, an, information, revolution, as, a, result, venzke, describes, the, inauguration, of, the, renaissance, reformation, and, humanist, movement, as, unthinkable, without, gutenberg, s, influence, described, as, one, of, the, most, recognized, names, in, the, world, a, team, of, us, journalists, voted, gutenberg, as, the, man, of, the, millennium, in, 1999, similarly, in, 1999, the, a, e, network, ranked, gutenberg, the, no, 1, most, influential, person, of, the, second, millennium, on, their, biographies, of, the, millennium, countdown, while, time, life, magazine, picked, gutenberg, s, invention, as, the, most, important, of, the, second, millennium, in, 1997, the, scholar, of, paper, history, thomas, francis, carter, drew, parallels, between, cai, lun, the, traditional, inventor, of, paper, during, the, eastern, han, dynasty, and, gutenberg, calling, them, spiritual, father, and, son, respectively, in, his, 1978, book, the, 100, a, ranking, of, the, most, influential, persons, in, history, michael, h, hart, ranked, him, 8th, below, cai, but, above, figures, such, as, christopher, columbus, albert, einstein, and, charles, darwin, the, capital, of, printing, in, europe, shifted, to, venice, where, printers, like, aldus, manutius, ensured, widespread, availability, of, the, major, greek, and, latin, texts, the, claims, of, an, italian, origin, for, movable, type, have, focused, on, this, rapid, rise, of, italy, in, movable, type, printing, this, may, perhaps, be, explained, by, the, prior, eminence, of, italy, in, the, paper, and, printing, trade, italy, s, economy, was, growing, rapidly, at, the, time, facilitating, the, spread, of, literacy, christopher, columbus, had, a, geography, book, printed, with, movable, type, bought, by, his, father, it, is, now, in, the, biblioteca, colombina, in, seville, finally, the, city, of, mainz, was, sacked, in, 1462, driving, many, printers, into, exile, printing, was, also, a, factor, in, the, reformation, martin, luther, s, ninety, five, theses, were, printed, and, circulated, widely, subsequently, he, issued, broadsheets, outlining, his, anti, indulgences, position, certificates, of, indulgences, were, one, of, the, first, items, gutenberg, had, printed, due, to, this, gutenberg, would, also, be, viewed, as, a, proto, protestant, the, broadsheet, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, newspaper, there, are, many, statues, of, gutenberg, in, germany, including, one, by, bertel, thorvaldsen, 1837, at, gutenbergplatz, in, mainz, home, to, the, eponymous, johannes, gutenberg, university, of, mainz, and, gutenberg, museum, on, the, history, of, early, printing, the, latter, publishes, the, gutenberg, jahrbuch, the, leading, periodical, in, the, history, of, printing, and, the, book, in, 1952, the, united, states, postal, service, issued, a, five, hundredth, anniversary, stamp, commemorating, johannes, gutenberg, invention, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, in, space, he, is, commemorated, in, the, name, of, the, asteroid, 777, gutemberga, two, operas, based, on, gutenberg, are, g, being, the, confession, and, last,
