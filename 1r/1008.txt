great, was, an, egyptian, pharaoh, he, was, the, third, ruler, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, along, with, thutmose, iii, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, he, is, often, regarded, as, the, greatest, most, celebrated, and, most, powerful, pharaoh, of, the, new, kingdom, which, itself, was, the, most, powerful, period, of, ancient, egypt, he, is, also, widely, considered, one, of, ancient, egypt, s, most, successful, warrior, pharaohs, conducting, no, fewer, than, 15, military, campaigns, all, resulting, in, victories, excluding, the, battle, of, kadesh, generally, considered, a, stalemate, in, ancient, greek, sources, he, is, called, ozymandias, derived, from, the, first, part, of, his, egyptian, language, regnal, name, usermaatre, setepenre, ramesses, was, also, referred, to, as, the, great, ancestor, by, successor, pharaohs, and, the, egyptian, people, for, the, early, part, of, his, reign, he, focused, on, building, cities, temples, and, monuments, after, establishing, the, city, of, pi, ramesses, in, the, nile, delta, he, designated, it, as, egypt, s, new, capital, and, used, it, as, the, main, staging, point, for, his, campaigns, in, syria, ramesses, led, several, military, expeditions, into, the, levant, where, he, reasserted, egyptian, control, over, canaan, and, phoenicia, he, also, led, a, number, of, expeditions, into, nubia, all, commemorated, in, inscriptions, at, beit, el, wali, and, gerf, hussein, he, celebrated, an, unprecedented, thirteen, or, fourteen, sed, festivals, more, than, any, other, pharaoh, estimates, of, his, age, at, death, vary, although, 90, or, 91, is, considered, to, be, the, most, likely, figure, upon, his, death, he, was, buried, in, a, tomb, kv7, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, his, body, was, later, moved, to, the, royal, cache, where, it, was, discovered, by, archaeologists, in, 1881, ramesses, mummy, is, now, on, display, at, the, national, museum, of, egyptian, civilization, located, in, the, city, of, cairo, ramesses, ii, was, not, born, a, prince, his, grandfather, ramesses, i, was, a, vizier, and, military, officer, during, the, reign, of, pharaoh, horemheb, who, appointed, ramesses, i, as, his, successor, at, this, time, ramesses, ii, was, about, eleven, years, old, after, ramesses, i, died, his, son, seti, i, became, king, and, designated, his, son, ramesses, ii, as, prince, regent, at, about, the, age, of, fourteen, ramesses, date, of, accession, to, the, throne, is, recorded, as, iii, shemu, day, 27, which, most, egyptologists, believe, to, be, 31, may, 1279, bc, the, jewish, historian, josephus, in, his, book, contra, apionem, which, included, material, from, manetho, s, aegyptiaca, assigned, ramesses, ii, armesses, miamun, a, reign, of, 66, years, 2, months, this, is, essentially, confirmed, by, the, calendar, of, papyrus, gurob, fragment, l, where, year, 67, i, akhet, day, 18, of, ramesses, ii, is, immediately, followed, by, year, 1, ii, akhet, day, 19, of, merneptah, ramesses, ii, s, son, meaning, ramesses, ii, died, about, 2, months, into, his, 67th, regnal, year, in, 1994, a, j, peden, proposed, that, ramesses, ii, died, between, ii, akhet, day, 3, and, ii, akhet, day, 13, on, the, basis, of, theban, graffito, 854, 855, equated, to, merneptah, s, year, 1, ii, akhet, day, 2, the, workman, s, village, of, deir, el, medina, preserves, a, fragment, of, a, mid, 20th, dynasty, necropolis, journal, p, turin, prov, nr, 8538, recto, i, 5, unpublished, which, records, that, the, date, ii, akhet, day, 6, was, a, free, feast, day, for, the, sailing, of, usimare, setepenre, for, ramesses, ii, as, the, egyptologist, robert, j, demar, e, notes, in, a, 2016, paper, the, date, of, ramesses, ii, s, recorded, passing, on, ii, akhet, day, 6, falls, perfectly, within, a, j, peden, s, estimated, timeline, for, this, king, s, death, in, the, interval, between, ii, akhet, day, 3, and, ii, akhet, day, 13, this, means, that, ramesses, ii, died, on, year, 67, ii, akhet, day, 6, of, his, reign, after, ruling, egypt, for, 66, years, 2, months, and, 9, days, early, in, his, life, ramesses, ii, embarked, on, numerous, campaigns, to, restore, possession, of, previously, held, territories, lost, to, the, nubians, and, hittites, and, to, secure, egypt, s, borders, he, was, also, responsible, for, suppressing, some, nubian, revolts, and, carrying, out, a, campaign, in, libya, though, the, battle, of, kadesh, often, dominates, the, scholarly, view, of, ramesses, ii, s, military, prowess, and, power, he, nevertheless, enjoyed, more, than, a, few, outright, victories, over, egypt, s, enemies, during, his, reign, the, egyptian, army, is, estimated, to, have, totaled, some, 100, 000, men, a, formidable, force, that, he, used, to, strengthen, egyptian, influence, in, his, second, year, ramesses, ii, decisively, defeated, the, sherden, sea, pirates, who, were, wreaking, havoc, along, egypt, s, mediterranean, coast, by, attacking, cargo, laden, vessels, travelling, the, sea, routes, to, egypt, the, sherden, people, probably, came, from, the, coast, of, ionia, from, southwest, anatolia, or, perhaps, also, from, the, island, of, sardinia, ramesses, posted, troops, and, ships, at, strategic, points, along, the, coast, and, patiently, allowed, the, pirates, to, attack, their, perceived, prey, before, skillfully, catching, them, by, surprise, in, a, sea, battle, and, capturing, them, all, in, a, single, action, a, stele, from, tanis, speaks, of, their, having, come, in, their, war, ships, from, the, midst, of, the, sea, and, none, were, able, to, stand, before, them, there, probably, was, a, naval, battle, somewhere, near, the, mouth, of, the, nile, as, shortly, afterward, many, sherden, are, seen, among, the, pharaoh, s, body, guard, where, they, are, conspicuous, by, their, horned, helmets, having, a, ball, projecting, from, the, middle, their, round, shields, and, the, great, naue, ii, swords, with, which, they, are, depicted, in, inscriptions, of, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, that, sea, battle, together, with, the, sherden, the, pharaoh, also, defeated, the, lukka, l, kkw, possibly, the, people, later, known, as, the, lycians, and, the, qrs, w, shekelesh, peoples, the, immediate, antecedents, to, the, battle, of, kadesh, were, the, early, campaigns, of, ramesses, ii, into, canaan, his, first, campaign, seems, to, have, taken, place, in, the, fourth, year, of, his, reign, and, was, commemorated, by, the, erection, of, what, became, the, first, of, the, commemorative, stelae, of, nahr, el, kalb, near, what, is, now, beirut, the, inscription, is, almost, totally, illegible, due, to, weathering, in, the, fourth, year, of, his, reign, he, captured, the, hittite, vassal, state, of, the, amurru, during, his, campaign, in, syria, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, his, fifth, regnal, year, was, the, climactic, engagement, in, a, campaign, that, ramesses, fought, in, syria, against, the, resurgent, hittite, forces, of, muwatalli, ii, the, pharaoh, wanted, a, victory, at, kadesh, both, to, expand, egypt, s, frontiers, into, syria, and, to, emulate, his, father, seti, i, s, triumphal, entry, into, the, city, just, a, decade, or, so, earlier, he, also, constructed, his, new, capital, pi, ramesses, there, he, built, factories, to, manufacture, weapons, chariots, and, shields, supposedly, producing, some, 1, 000, weapons, in, a, week, about, 250, chariots, in, two, weeks, and, 1, 000, shields, in, a, week, and, a, half, after, these, preparations, ramesses, moved, to, attack, territory, in, the, levant, which, belonged, to, a, more, substantial, enemy, than, any, he, had, ever, faced, in, war, the, hittite, empire, after, advancing, through, canaan, for, exactly, a, month, according, to, the, egyptian, sources, ramesses, arrived, at, kadesh, on, 1, may, 1274, bc, here, ramesses, troops, were, caught, in, a, hittite, ambush, and, were, initially, outnumbered, by, the, enemy, whose, chariotry, smashed, through, the, second, division, of, ramesses, forces, and, attacked, his, camp, receiving, reinforcements, from, other, egyptian, divisions, arriving, on, the, battlefield, the, egyptians, counterattacked, and, routed, the, hittites, whose, survivors, abandoned, their, chariots, and, swam, the, orontes, river, to, reach, the, safe, city, walls, although, left, in, possession, of, the, battlefield, ramesses, logistically, unable, to, sustain, a, long, siege, returned, to, egypt, while, ramesses, claimed, a, great, victory, and, this, was, technically, true, in, terms, of, the, actual, battle, it, is, generally, considered, that, the, hittites, were, the, ultimate, victors, as, far, as, the, overall, campaign, was, concerned, since, the, egyptians, retreated, after, the, battle, and, hittite, forces, invaded, and, briefly, occupied, the, egyptian, possessions, in, the, region, of, damascus, egypt, s, sphere, of, influence, was, now, restricted, to, canaan, while, syria, fell, into, hittite, hands, canaanite, princes, seemingly, encouraged, by, the, egyptian, incapacity, to, impose, their, will, and, goaded, on, by, the, hittites, began, revolts, against, egypt, ramesses, ii, was, not, willing, to, let, this, stand, and, prepared, to, contest, the, hittite, advance, with, new, military, campaigns, because, they, are, recorded, on, his, monuments, with, few, indications, of, precise, dates, or, the, regnal, year, the, precise, chronology, of, the, subsequent, campaigns, is, not, entirely, clear, late, in, the, seventh, year, of, his, reign, april, may, 1272, bc, ramesses, ii, returned, to, syria, once, again, this, time, he, proved, more, successful, against, his, hittite, foes, during, this, campaign, he, split, his, army, into, two, forces, one, force, was, led, by, his, son, amun, her, khepeshef, and, it, chased, warriors, of, the, hasu, tribes, across, the, negev, as, far, as, the, dead, sea, capturing, edom, seir, it, then, marched, on, to, capture, moab, the, other, force, led, by, ramesses, himself, attacked, jerusalem, and, jericho, he, too, then, entered, moab, where, he, rejoined, his, son, the, reunited, army, then, marched, on, hesbon, damascus, on, to, kumidi, and, finally, recaptured, upi, the, land, around, damascus, reestablishing, egypt, s, former, sphere, of, influence, ramesses, extended, his, military, successes, in, his, eighth, and, ninth, years, he, crossed, the, dog, river, nahr, al, kalb, and, pushed, north, into, amurru, his, armies, managed, to, march, as, far, north, as, dapur, where, he, had, a, statue, of, himself, erected, the, egyptian, pharaoh, thus, found, himself, in, northern, amurru, well, past, kadesh, in, tunip, where, no, egyptian, soldier, had, been, seen, since, the, time, of, thutmose, iii, almost, 120, years, earlier, he, laid, siege, to, dapur, before, capturing, it, and, returning, to, egypt, by, november, 1272, bc, ramesses, was, back, in, egypt, at, heliopolis, his, victory, in, the, north, proved, ephemeral, after, having, reasserted, his, power, over, canaan, ramesses, led, his, army, north, a, mostly, illegible, stele, at, the, dog, river, near, beirut, which, appears, to, be, dated, to, the, king, s, second, year, was, probably, set, up, there, in, his, tenth, 1269, bc, the, thin, strip, of, territory, pinched, between, amurru, and, kadesh, did, not, make, for, a, stable, possession, within, a, year, they, had, returned, to, the, hittite, fold, so, that, ramesses, had, to, march, against, dapur, once, more, in, his, tenth, year, this, time, he, claimed, to, have, fought, the, battle, without, even, bothering, to, put, on, his, corslet, until, two, hours, after, the, fighting, began, six, of, ramesses, s, youthful, sons, still, wearing, their, side, locks, took, part, in, this, conquest, he, took, towns, in, retjenu, and, tunip, in, naharin, later, recorded, on, the, walls, of, the, ramesseum, this, second, success, at, the, location, was, equally, as, meaningless, as, his, first, as, neither, power, could, decisively, defeat, the, other, in, battle, in, year, eighteen, ramesses, erected, a, stele, at, beth, shean, on, 19, january, 1261, bc, in, year, 21, of, ramesses, s, reign, he, concluded, a, peace, treaty, with, the, hittites, known, to, modern, scholars, as, the, treaty, of, kadesh, though, this, treaty, settled, the, disputes, over, canaan, its, immediate, impetus, seems, to, have, been, a, diplomatic, crisis, that, occurred, following, attu, ili, iii, s, accession, to, the, hittite, throne, attu, ili, had, come, to, power, by, deposing, his, nephew, mur, ili, iii, in, the, brief, and, bitter, hittite, civil, war, though, the, deposed, king, was, initially, sent, into, exile, in, syria, he, subsequently, attempted, to, regain, power, and, fled, to, egypt, once, these, attempts, were, discovered, when, attu, ili, demanded, his, extradition, ramesses, ii, denied, any, knowledge, of, his, wherabouts, when, attu, ili, insisted, that, mur, ili, was, in, egypt, ramesses, s, response, suggested, that, attu, ili, was, being, deceived, by, his, subjects, this, demand, precipitated, a, crisis, and, the, two, empires, came, dangerously, close, to, war, eventually, in, the, twenty, first, year, of, his, reign, 1259, bc, ramesses, decided, to, conclude, an, agreement, at, kadesh, to, end, the, conflict, the, peace, treaty, was, recorded, in, two, versions, one, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, other, in, hittite, using, cuneiform, script, both, versions, survive, such, dual, language, recording, is, common, to, many, subsequent, treaties, this, treaty, differs, from, others, in, that, the, two, language, versions, are, worded, differently, while, the, majority, of, the, text, is, identical, the, hittite, version, says, the, egyptians, came, suing, for, peace, and, the, egyptian, version, says, the, reverse, the, treaty, was, given, to, the, egyptians, in, the, form, of, a, silver, plaque, and, this, pocket, book, version, was, taken, back, to, egypt, and, carved, into, the, temple, at, karnak, the, egyptian, account, records, ramesses, ii, s, receipt, of, the, hittite, peace, treaty, tablets, on, i, peret, 21, of, year, 21, corresponding, to, 10, november, 1259, bc, according, to, the, standard, low, chronology, used, by, egyptologists, the, treaty, was, concluded, between, ramesses, ii, and, attu, ili, iii, in, year, 21, of, ramesses, s, reign, c, 1259, bc, its, 18, articles, call, for, peace, between, egypt, and, hatti, and, then, proceeds, to, maintain, that, their, respective, deities, also, demand, peace, the, frontiers, are, not, laid, down, in, this, treaty, but, may, be, inferred, from, other, documents, the, anastasy, a, papyrus, describes, canaan, during, the, latter, part, of, the, reign, of, ramesses, ii, and, enumerates, and, names, the, phoenician, coastal, towns, under, egyptian, control, the, harbour, town, of, sumur, north, of, byblos, is, mentioned, as, the, northernmost, town, belonging, to, egypt, suggesting, it, contained, an, egyptian, garrison, no, further, egyptian, campaigns, in, canaan, are, mentioned, after, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, treaty, the, northern, border, seems, to, have, been, safe, and, quiet, so, the, rule, of, the, pharaoh, was, strong, until, ramesses, ii, s, death, and, the, subsequent, waning, of, the, dynasty, when, the, king, of, mira, attempted, to, involve, ramesses, in, a, hostile, act, against, the, hittites, the, egyptian, responded, that, the, times, of, intrigue, in, support, of, mursili, iii, had, passed, attu, ili, iii, wrote, to, kadashman, enlil, ii, kassite, king, of, kardunia, babylon, in, the, same, spirit, reminding, him, of, the, time, when, his, father, kadashman, turgu, had, offered, to, fight, ramesses, ii, the, king, of, egypt, the, hittite, king, encouraged, the, babylonian, to, oppose, another, enemy, which, must, have, been, the, king, of, assyria, whose, allies, had, killed, the, messenger, of, the, egyptian, king, attu, ili, encouraged, kadashman, enlil, to, come, to, his, aid, and, prevent, the, assyrians, from, cutting, the, link, between, the, canaanite, province, of, egypt, and, mursili, iii, the, ally, of, ramesses, ramesses, ii, also, campaigned, south, of, the, first, cataract, of, the, nile, into, nubia, when, ramesses, was, about, 22, two, of, his, own, sons, including, amun, her, khepeshef, accompanied, him, in, at, least, one, of, those, campaigns, by, the, time, of, ramesses, nubia, had, been, a, colony, for, 200, years, but, its, conquest, was, recalled, in, decoration, from, the, temples, ramesses, ii, built, at, beit, el, wali, which, was, the, subject, of, epigraphic, work, by, the, oriental, institute, during, the, nubian, salvage, campaign, of, the, 1960s, gerf, hussein, and, kalabsha, in, northern, nubia, on, the, south, wall, of, the, beit, el, wali, temple, ramesses, ii, is, depicted, charging, into, battle, against, tribes, south, of, egypt, in, a, war, chariot, while, his, two, young, sons, amun, her, khepsef, and, khaemwaset, are, shown, behind, him, also, in, war, chariots, a, wall, in, one, of, ramesses, s, temples, says, he, had, to, fight, one, battle, with, those, tribes, without, help, from, his, soldiers, during, the, reign, of, ramesses, ii, the, egyptians, were, evidently, active, on, a, 300, kilometre, 190, mi, stretch, along, the, mediterranean, coast, at, least, as, far, as, zawyet, umm, el, rakham, where, remains, of, a, fortress, described, by, its, texts, as, built, on, libyans, land, have, been, found, although, the, exact, events, surrounding, the, foundation, of, the, coastal, forts, and, fortresses, is, not, clear, some, degree, of, political, and, military, control, must, have, been, held, over, the, region, to, allow, their, construction, there, are, no, detailed, accounts, of, ramesses, ii, s, undertaking, large, military, actions, against, the, libyans, only, generalised, records, of, his, conquering, and, crushing, them, which, may, or, may, not, refer, to, specific, events, that, were, otherwise, unrecorded, it, may, be, that, some, of, the, records, such, as, the, aswan, stele, of, his, year, 2, are, harking, back, to, ramesses, s, presence, on, his, father, s, libyan, campaigns, perhaps, it, was, seti, i, who, achieved, this, supposed, control, over, the, region, and, who, planned, to, establish, the, defensive, system, in, a, manner, similar, to, how, he, rebuilt, those, to, the, east, the, ways, of, horus, across, northern, sinai, after, reigning, for, 30, years, ramesses, joined, a, select, group, that, included, only, a, handful, of, egypt, s, longest, lived, rulers, by, tradition, in, the, 30th, year, of, his, reign, ramesses, celebrated, a, jubilee, called, the, sed, festival, these, were, held, to, honour, and, rejuvenate, the, pharaoh, s, strength, only, halfway, through, what, would, be, a, 66, year, reign, ramesses, had, already, eclipsed, all, but, a, few, of, his, greatest, predecessors, in, his, achievements, he, had, brought, peace, maintained, egyptian, borders, and, built, great, and, numerous, monuments, across, the, empire, his, country, was, more, prosperous, and, powerful, than, it, had, been, in, nearly, a, century, sed, festivals, traditionally, were, held, again, every, three, years, after, the, 30th, year, ramesses, ii, who, sometimes, held, them, after, two, years, eventually, celebrated, an, unprecedented, thirteen, or, fourteen, in, the, third, year, of, his, reign, ramesses, started, the, most, ambitious, building, project, after, the, pyramids, which, were, built, almost, 1, 500, years, earlier, the, population, was, put, to, work, changing, the, face, of, egypt, ramesses, built, extensively, from, the, delta, to, nubia, covering, the, land, with, buildings, in, a, way, no, monarch, before, him, had, some, of, the, activities, undertaken, were, focused, on, remodeling, or, usurping, existing, works, improving, masonry, techniques, and, using, art, as, propaganda, ramesses, also, undertook, many, new, construction, projects, two, of, his, biggest, works, besides, pi, ramesses, were, the, temple, complex, of, abu, simbel, and, the, ramesseum, a, mortuary, temple, in, western, thebes, ramesses, ii, moved, the, capital, of, his, kingdom, from, thebes, in, the, nile, valley, to, a, new, site, in, the, eastern, delta, his, motives, are, uncertain, although, he, possibly, wished, to, be, closer, to, his, territories, in, canaan, and, syria, the, new, city, of, pi, ramesses, or, to, give, the, full, name, pi, ramesses, aa, nakhtu, meaning, domain, of, ramesses, great, in, victory, was, dominated, by, huge, temples, and, his, vast, residential, palace, complete, with, its, own, zoo, in, the, 10th, century, ad, the, bible, exegete, rabbi, saadia, gaon, believed, that, the, biblical, site, of, ramesses, had, to, be, identified, with, ain, shams, for, a, time, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, site, was, misidentified, as, that, of, tanis, due, to, the, amount, of, statuary, and, other, material, from, pi, ramesses, found, there, but, it, now, is, recognized, that, the, ramesside, remains, at, tanis, were, brought, there, from, elsewhere, and, the, real, pi, ramesses, lies, about, 30, km, 18, 6, mi, south, near, modern, qantir, the, colossal, feet, of, the, statue, of, ramesses, are, almost, all, that, remains, above, ground, today, the, rest, is, buried, in, the, fields, the, temple, complex, built, by, ramesses, ii, between, qurna, and, the, desert, has, been, known, as, the, ramesseum, since, the, 19th, century, the, greek, historian, diodorus, siculus, marveled, at, the, gigantic, temple, now, no, more, than, a, few, ruins, oriented, northwest, and, southeast, the, temple, was, preceded, by, two, courts, an, enormous, pylon, stood, before, the, first, court, with, the, royal, palace, at, the,

of, war, and, the, alleged, rout, of, the, hittites, at, kadesh, are, repeated, on, the, walls, in, the, upper, registers, feast, and, honor, of, the, phallic, deity, min, god, of, fertility, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, court, the, few, osiride, pillars, and, columns, still, remaining, may, furnish, an, idea, of, the, original, grandeur, scattered, remains, of, the, two, statues, of, the, seated, king, also, may, be, seen, one, in, pink, granite, and, the, other, in, black, granite, which, once, flanked, the, entrance, to, the, temple, thirty, nine, out, of, the, forty, eight, columns,
