were, the, discoveries, of, several, comets, including, the, periodic, comet, 35p, herschel, rigollet, which, bears, her, name, she, was, the, younger, sister, of, astronomer, william, herschel, with, whom, she, worked, throughout, her, career, she, was, the, first, woman, to, receive, a, salary, as, a, scientist, and, the, first, woman, in, england, to, hold, a, government, position, she, was, also, the, first, woman, to, publish, scientific, findings, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, to, be, awarded, a, gold, medal, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, 1828, and, to, be, named, an, honorary, member, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, 1835, with, mary, somerville, she, was, named, an, honorary, member, of, the, royal, irish, academy, 1838, the, king, of, prussia, presented, her, with, a, gold, medal, for, science, on, the, occasion, of, her, 96th, birthday, 1846, caroline, lucretia, herschel, was, born, in, the, town, of, hanover, germany, on, 16, march, 1750, she, was, the, eighth, child, and, fourth, daughter, of, isaak, herschel, 1707, 1767, a, self, taught, oboist, and, his, wife, anna, ilse, moritzen, 1710, 1789, the, herschel, family, originated, from, pirna, in, saxony, near, dresden, isaak, became, a, bandmaster, in, the, hanoverian, foot, guards, whom, he, first, joined, in, 1731, and, was, away, with, his, regiment, for, substantial, periods, he, became, ill, after, the, battle, of, dettingen, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, in, 1743, and, never, recovered, fully, he, suffered, a, weak, constitution, chronic, pain, and, asthma, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, the, oldest, of, their, daughters, sophia, elizabeth, herschel, 1733, 1803, was, sixteen, years, older, and, the, only, surviving, girl, besides, caroline, she, married, violinist, johann, heinrich, griesbach, 1730, 1773, when, caroline, was, five, which, resulted, in, the, younger, girl, being, tasked, with, much, of, the, household, drudgery, caroline, and, the, other, children, received, a, cursory, education, learning, to, read, and, write, and, little, more, her, father, attempted, to, educate, her, at, home, but, his, efforts, were, more, successful, with, the, boys, at, the, age, of, ten, caroline, was, struck, with, a, severe, case, of, typhus, which, so, stunted, her, growth, that, she, never, grew, more, than, 4, feet, 3, inches, 1, 30, m, tall, she, also, lost, vision, in, her, left, eye, as, a, result, of, the, illness, her, family, assumed, that, she, would, never, marry, and, her, mother, thought, better, that, she, train, to, be, a, house, servant, than, be, educated, in, accordance, with, her, father, s, wishes, however, her, father, sometimes, took, advantage, of, her, mother, s, absence, by, tutoring, her, individually, or, including, her, in, her, brother, s, lessons, such, as, violin, caroline, was, briefly, allowed, to, learn, dress, making, though, she, learned, to, do, needlework, from, a, neighbour, her, efforts, were, stymied, by, long, hours, of, household, chores, to, prevent, her, from, becoming, a, governess, and, earning, her, independence, that, way, she, was, forbidden, to, learn, french, or, more, advanced, needlework, than, what, she, could, pick, up, from, neighbours, following, her, father, s, death, her, brothers, william, and, alexander, proposed, that, she, join, them, in, bath, england, to, have, a, trial, period, as, a, singer, for, musician, brother, william, s, church, performances, caroline, eventually, left, hanover, on, 16, august, 1772, after, her, brothers, intervened, with, their, recalcitrant, mother, on, the, journey, to, england, she, was, first, introduced, to, astronomy, by, way, of, the, constellations, and, opticians, shops, in, bath, she, took, on, the, responsibilities, of, running, william, s, household, and, began, learning, to, sing, william, had, established, himself, as, an, organist, and, music, teacher, at, 19, new, king, street, bath, now, the, herschel, museum, of, astronomy, he, was, also, the, choirmaster, of, the, octagon, chapel, william, was, busy, with, his, musical, career, and, became, fairly, busy, organising, public, concerts, caroline, did, not, blend, into, the, local, society, and, made, few, friends, but, was, finally, able, to, indulge, her, desire, to, learn, and, took, regular, singing, english, and, arithmetic, lessons, from, her, brother, and, dance, lessons, from, a, local, teacher, she, also, learned, to, play, the, harpsichord, and, eventually, became, an, integral, part, in, william, s, musical, performances, at, small, gatherings, she, became, the, principal, singer, at, his, oratorio, concerts, and, acquired, such, a, reputation, as, a, vocalist, that, she, was, offered, an, engagement, for, the, birmingham, festival, after, a, performance, of, handel, s, messiah, in, april, 1778, where, she, was, the, first, soloist, she, declined, to, sing, for, any, conductor, but, william, and, after, that, performance, her, career, as, a, singer, began, to, decline, caroline, was, subsequently, replaced, as, a, performer, by, distinguished, soloists, from, outside, the, area, because, william, wished, to, spend, less, time, in, rehearsals, to, focus, on, astronomy, when, william, became, increasingly, interested, in, astronomy, transforming, himself, from, a, musician, to, an, astronomer, caroline, again, supported, his, efforts, she, said, somewhat, bitterly, in, her, memoir, i, did, nothing, for, my, brother, but, what, a, well, trained, puppy, dog, would, have, done, that, is, to, say, i, did, what, he, commanded, me, ultimately, though, she, became, interested, in, astronomy, and, enjoyed, her, work, in, the, 1770s, as, william, became, more, interested, in, astronomy, he, started, to, build, his, own, telescopes, from, lenses, he, had, ground, unhappy, with, the, quality, of, lenses, he, was, able, to, purchase, caroline, would, feed, him, and, read, to, him, as, he, worked, despite, her, desire, to, burnish, her, career, as, a, professional, singer, she, became, a, significant, astronomer, in, her, own, right, as, a, result, of, her, collaboration, with, him, the, herschels, moved, to, a, new, house, in, march, 1781, after, their, millinery, business, failed, and, caroline, was, guarding, the, leftover, stock, on, 13, march, the, night, that, william, discovered, the, planet, uranus, though, he, mistook, it, for, a, comet, his, discovery, proved, the, superiority, of, his, new, telescope, caroline, and, william, gave, their, last, musical, performance, in, 1782, when, her, brother, accepted, the, private, office, of, court, astronomer, to, king, george, iii, the, last, few, months, of, their, musical, career, had, been, a, shambles, and, were, critically, panned, william, s, interest, in, astronomy, started, as, a, hobby, to, pass, time, at, night, at, breakfast, the, next, day, he, would, give, an, impromptu, lecture, on, what, he, had, learned, the, night, before, caroline, became, as, interested, as, william, stating, that, she, was, much, hindered, in, my, practice, by, my, help, being, continually, wanted, in, the, execution, of, the, various, astronomical, contrivances, william, became, known, for, his, work, on, high, performance, telescopes, and, caroline, found, herself, supporting, his, efforts, caroline, spent, many, hours, polishing, mirrors, and, mounting, telescopes, in, order, to, maximize, the, amount, of, light, captured, she, learned, to, copy, astronomical, catalogues, and, other, publications, that, william, had, borrowed, she, also, learned, to, record, reduce, and, organize, her, brother, s, astronomical, observations, she, recognized, that, this, work, demanded, speed, precision, and, accuracy, caroline, was, asked, to, move, from, the, high, culture, of, bath, to, the, relative, backwater, of, datchet, in, 1782, a, small, town, near, windsor, castle, where, william, would, be, on, hand, to, entertain, royal, guests, he, presumed, that, caroline, would, become, his, assistant, a, role, she, did, not, initially, accept, she, was, unhappy, with, the, accommodations, they, had, taken, the, house, they, rented, for, three, years, had, a, leaky, ceiling, and, caroline, described, it, as, the, ruins, of, a, place, she, was, also, aghast, at, the, prices, in, the, city, and, the, fact, that, their, domestic, servant, was, imprisoned, for, theft, at, the, time, of, her, arrival, while, william, worked, on, a, catalogue, of, 3, 000, stars, studied, double, stars, and, attempted, to, discover, the, cause, of, mira, s, and, algol, s, variability, caroline, was, asked, to, sweep, the, sky, meticulously, moving, through, the, sky, in, strips, to, search, for, interesting, objects, she, was, unhappy, with, this, task, at, the, beginning, of, her, work, longing, for, the, culture, of, bath, and, feeling, isolated, and, lonely, but, gradually, developed, a, love, for, the, work, on, 28, august, 1782, caroline, initiated, her, first, record, book, she, inscribed, the, first, three, opening, pages, this, is, what, i, call, the, bills, rec, ds, of, my, comets, comets, and, letters, and, books, of, observations, this, along, with, two, subsequent, books, currently, belong, to, the, herschel, trove, at, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, london, on, 26, february, 1783, caroline, made, her, first, discovery, she, had, found, a, nebula, that, was, not, included, in, the, messier, catalogue, that, same, night, she, independently, discovered, messier, 110, ngc, 205, the, second, companion, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, william, then, began, to, search, himself, for, nebulae, sensing, that, there, were, many, discoveries, to, be, made, caroline, was, relegated, to, a, ladder, on, william, s, 20, foot, reflector, attempting, impossible, measurements, of, double, stars, william, quickly, realized, his, method, of, searching, for, nebulae, was, inefficient, and, he, required, an, assistant, to, keep, records, naturally, he, turned, to, caroline, but, it, was, not, til, the, last, two, months, of, the, same, year, before, i, felt, the, least, encouragement, for, spending, the, starlight, nights, on, a, grass, plot, covered, with, dew, or, hoar, frost, without, a, human, being, near, enough, to, be, within, call, in, the, summer, of, 1783, william, finished, building, a, comet, searching, telescope, for, caroline, which, she, began, to, use, immediately, beginning, in, october, 1783, the, herschels, used, a, 20, foot, reflecting, telescope, to, search, for, nebulae, initially, william, attempted, to, both, observe, and, record, objects, but, this, too, was, inefficient, and, he, again, turned, to, caroline, she, sat, by, a, window, inside, william, shouted, his, observations, and, caroline, recorded, this, was, not, a, simple, clerical, task, however, because, she, would, have, to, use, john, flamsteed, s, catalogue, to, identify, the, star, william, used, as, a, reference, point, for, the, nebulae, in, 1798, caroline, presented, to, the, royal, society, an, index, to, john, flamsteed, s, observations, together, with, a, catalog, of, 560, stars, omitted, from, the, british, catalogue, and, a, list, of, the, errata, in, that, publication, because, flamsteed, s, catalogue, was, organized, by, constellation, it, was, less, useful, to, the, herschels, so, caroline, created, her, own, catalogue, organized, by, north, polar, distance, the, following, morning, caroline, would, go, over, her, notes, and, write, up, formal, observations, which, she, called, minding, the, heavens, during, 1786, 1797, she, discovered, eight, comets, the, first, on, 1, august, 1786, while, her, brother, was, away, and, she, was, using, his, telescope, she, had, unquestioned, priority, as, discoverer, of, five, of, the, comets, and, rediscovered, comet, encke, in, 1795, five, of, her, comets, were, published, in, philosophical, transactions, a, packet, of, paper, bearing, the, superscription, this, is, what, i, call, the, bills, and, receipts, of, my, comets, contains, some, data, connected, with, the, discovery, of, each, of, these, objects, william, was, summoned, to, windsor, castle, to, demonstrate, caroline, s, comet, to, the, royal, family, william, recorded, this, phenomenon, himself, terming, it, my, sister, s, comet, caroline, herschel, is, often, credited, as, the, first, woman, to, discover, a, comet, however, maria, kirch, discovered, a, comet, in, the, early, 1700s, but, is, often, overlooked, because, at, the, time, the, discovery, was, attributed, to, her, husband, gottfried, kirch, she, wrote, a, letter, to, the, astronomer, royal, nevil, maskelyne, to, announce, the, discovery, of, her, second, comet, in, december, 1788, maskelyne, wrote, back, congratulating, her, the, third, comet, was, discovered, on, 7, january, 1790, and, the, fourth, one, on, 17, april, 1790, she, announced, both, of, these, to, sir, joseph, banks, and, all, were, discovered, with, her, 1783, telescope, in, 1791, caroline, began, to, use, a, 9, inch, telescope, for, her, comet, searching, and, discovered, three, more, comets, with, this, instrument, her, fifth, comet, was, discovered, on, 15, december, 1791, and, the, sixth, on, 7, october, 1795, caroline, wrote, in, her, journal, during, this, time, my, brother, wrote, an, account, of, it, to, sir, j, banks, dr, maskelyne, and, to, several, astronomical, correspondents, for, the, discovery, of, her, fifth, comet, two, years, later, her, eighth, and, last, comet, was, discovered, on, 6, august, 1797, the, only, comet, she, discovered, without, optical, aid, she, announced, this, discovery, by, sending, a, letter, to, banks, in, 1787, she, was, granted, an, annual, salary, of, 50, equivalent, to, 8, 000, in, 2024, by, george, iii, for, her, work, as, william, s, assistant, caroline, s, appointment, made, her, the, first, woman, in, england, honoured, with, an, official, government, position, and, the, first, woman, to, be, paid, for, her, work, in, astronomy, in, 1797, william, s, observations, had, shown, that, there, were, a, great, many, discrepancies, in, the, star, catalogue, published, by, john, flamsteed, which, was, difficult, to, use, because, it, had, been, published, as, two, volumes, the, catalogue, proper, and, a, volume, of, original, observations, and, contained, many, errors, william, realised, that, he, needed, a, proper, cross, index, to, properly, explore, these, differences, but, was, reluctant, to, devote, time, to, it, at, the, expense, of, his, more, interesting, astronomical, activities, he, therefore, recommended, to, caroline, that, she, undertake, the, task, which, ultimately, took, 20, months, the, resulting, catalogue, of, stars, taken, from, mr, flamsteed, s, observations, contained, in, the, second, volume, of, the, historia, coelestis, and, not, inserted, in, the, british, catalogue, was, published, by, the, royal, society, in, 1798, and, contained, an, index, of, every, observation, of, every, star, made, by, flamsteed, a, list, of, errata, and, a, list, of, more, than, 560, stars, that, had, not, been, included, in, 1825, caroline, donated, the, works, of, flamsteed, to, the, royal, academy, of, g, ttingen, throughout, her, writings, she, repeatedly, made, it, clear, that, she, desired, to, earn, an, independent, wage, and, be, able, to, support, herself, when, the, crown, began, paying, her, for, her, assistance, to, her, brother, in, 1787, she, became, the, first, woman, at, a, time, when, even, men, rarely, received, wages, for, scientific, enterprises, to, receive, a, salary, for, services, to, science, her, pension, was, 50, a, year, and, it, was, the, first, money, that, caroline, had, ever, earned, in, her, own, right, when, william, married, a, rich, widow, mary, pitt, n, e, baldwin, in, 1788, the, union, caused, tension, in, the, brother, sister, relationship, caroline, has, been, referred, to, as, a, bitter, jealous, woman, who, worshipped, her, brother, and, resented, those, who, invaded, their, domestic, lives, in, his, book, the, age, of, wonder, richard, holmes, is, more, sympathetic, to, caroline, s, position, noting, that, the, change, was, in, many, respects, negative, for, caroline, with, the, arrival, of, william, s, wife, caroline, lost, her, managerial, and, social, responsibilities, in, the, household, and, accompanying, status, she, also, moved, from, the, house, to, external, lodgings, returning, daily, to, work, with, her, brother, she, no, longer, held, the, keys, to, the, observatory, and, workroom, where, she, had, done, much, of, her, own, work, as, she, destroyed, her, journals, from, 1788, to, 1798, her, feelings, about, the, period, are, not, entirely, known, in, august, 1799, caroline, was, independently, recognized, for, her, work, when, she, spent, a, week, in, greenwich, as, a, guest, of, the, royal, family, barth, lemy, faujas, de, saint, fond, indicated, she, and, her, brother, continued, working, well, during, this, period, when, her, brother, and, his, family, were, away, from, home, she, often, returned, there, to, take, care, of, it, for, them, in, later, life, she, and, lady, herschel, exchanged, affectionate, letters, and, she, became, deeply, attached, to, her, nephew, astronomer, john, herschel, william, s, marriage, likely, led, to, caroline, becoming, more, independent, of, her, brother, and, more, a, figure, in, her, own, right, caroline, made, many, discoveries, independently, of, william, and, continued, to, work, solo, on, many, of, the, astronomical, projects, which, contributed, to, her, rise, to, fame, in, 1802, the, royal, society, published, caroline, s, catalogue, in, its, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, a, under, william, s, name, this, listed, around, 500, new, nebulae, and, clusters, to, the, already, known, 2, 000, toward, the, end, of, caroline, s, life, she, arranged, 2, 500, nebulae, and, star, clusters, into, zones, of, similar, polar, distances, so, that, her, nephew, john, herschel, could, re, examine, them, systematically, the, list, was, eventually, enlarged, and, renamed, the, new, general, catalogue, many, non, stellar, objects, are, still, identified, by, their, ngc, number, after, her, brother, died, in, 1822, caroline, was, grief, stricken, and, moved, back, to, hanover, germany, continuing, her, astronomical, studies, to, verify, and, confirm, william, s, findings, and, producing, a, catalogue, of, nebulae, to, assist, her, nephew, john, herschel, in, his, work, her, nephew, thought, highly, of, her, in, fact, he, was, quoted, in, 1832, as, saying, she, runs, about, the, town, with, me, and, skips, up, her, two, flights, of, stairs, as, wonderfully, fresh, at, least, as, some, folks, i, could, name, who, are, not, a, fourth, of, her, age, in, the, morning, till, eleven, or, twelve, she, is, dull, and, weary, but, as, the, day, advances, she, gains, life, and, is, quite, fresh, and, funny, at, ten, or, eleven, p, m, and, sings, old, rhymes, nay, even, dances, to, the, great, delight, of, all, who, see, her, john, herschel, spent, long, periods, with, his, aunt, during, the, vacations, and, was, greatly, influenced, by, caroline, she, saw, him, educated, at, cambridge, make, a, name, for, himself, as, a, mathematician, become, elected, to, the, royal, society, join, his, father, in, research, in, astronomy, and, be, awarded, the, copley, medal, of, the, royal, society, for, his, achievements, caroline, continued, to, assist, william, with, his, observations, but, her, status, had, greatly, improved, from, the, housekeeper, she, had, been, in, her, young, days, she, was, the, guest, of, maskelyne, at, the, royal, observatory, in, 1799, and, a, guest, of, members, of, the, royal, family, at, various, times, in, 1816, 1817, and, 1818, however, her, observations, were, hampered, by, the, architecture, in, hanover, and, she, spent, most, of, her, time, working, on, the, catalogue, in, 1828, the, royal, astronomical, society, presented, her, with, their, gold, medal, for, this, work, no, woman, would, be, awarded, it, again, until, vera, rubin, in, 1996, upon, william, s, death, her, nephew, john, herschel, took, over, observing, at, slough, caroline, had, given, him, his, first, introduction, into, astronomy, when, she, showed, him, the, constellations, in, flamsteed, s, atlas, caroline, added, her, final, entry, to, her, observing, book, on, 31, january, 1824, about, the, great, comet, of, 1823, which, had, already, been, discovered, on, 29, december, 1823, throughout, the, twilight, of, her, life, caroline, remained, physically, active, and, healthy, and, regularly, socialized, with, other, scientific, luminaries, she, spent, her, last, years, writing, her, memoirs, and, lamenting, her, body, s, limitations, which, kept, her, from, making, any, more, original, discoveries, caroline, herschel, died, peacefully, in, hanover, on, 9, january, 1848, she, is, buried, at, 35, marienstrasse, in, hanover, at, the, cemetery, of, the, gartengemeinde, next, to, her, parents, and, with, a, lock, of, william, s, hair, her, tombstone, inscription, reads, the, eyes, of, her, who, is, glorified, here, below, turned, to, the, starry, heavens, with, her, brother, she, discovered, over, 2, 400, astronomical, objects, over, twenty, years, herschel, was, honoured, by, the, king, of, prussia, and, the, royal, astronomical, society, the, gold, medal, from, the, astronomical, society, was, awarded, to, her, in, 1828, for, her, recent, reduction, to, january, 1800, of, the, nebul, discovered, by, her, illustrious, brother, which, may, be, considered, as, the, completion, of, a, series, of, exertions, probably, unparalleled, either, in, magnitude, or, importance, in, the, annals, of, astronomical, labour, she, completed, this, work, after, her, brother, s, death, and, her, move, to, hanover, the, royal, astronomical, society, elected, her, an, honorary, member, in, 1835, along, with, mary, somerville, they, were, the, first, female, members, she, was, also, elected, as, an, honorary, member, of, the, royal, irish, academy, in, dublin, in, 1838, in, 1846, at, the, age, of, 96, she, was, awarded, a, gold, medal, for, science, by, the, king, of, prussia, conveyed, to, her, by, alexander, von, humboldt, in, recognition, of, the, valuable, services, rendered, to, astronomy, by, you, as, the, fellow, worker, of, your, immortal, brother, sir, william, herschel, by, discoveries, observations, and, laborious, calculations, the, asteroid, 281, lucretia, discovered, 1888, was, named, after, caroline, s, second, given, name, and, the, crater, c, herschel, on, the, moon, is, named, after, her, the, open,
