stem, partly, from, the, scathing, assessments, made, during, the, han, dynasty, that, succeeded, the, qin, since, the, mid, 20th, century, scholars, have, begun, questioning, this, evaluation, inciting, considerable, discussion, on, the, actual, nature, of, his, policies, and, reforms, according, to, the, sinologist, michael, loewe, few, would, contest, the, view, that, the, achievements, of, his, reign, have, exercised, a, paramount, influence, on, the, whole, of, china, s, subsequent, history, marking, the, start, of, an, epoch, that, closed, in, 1911, modern, chinese, sources, often, give, the, personal, name, of, qin, shi, huang, as, ying, zheng, with, y, ng, taken, as, the, surname, and, zheng, the, given, name, however, in, ancient, china, the, naming, convention,

modern, chinese, surnames, despite, usually, descending, from, clan, names, use, the, same, character, as, the, old, ancestral, names, it, is, much, more, common, in, modern, chinese, sources, to, see, the, emperor, s, personal, name, written, as, ying, zheng, using, the, ancestral, name, of, the, house, of, ying, the, rulers, of, the, state, of, qin, had, styled, themselves, kings, from, the, time, of, king, huiwen, in, 325, bc, upon, his, ascension, zheng, became, known, as, the, king, of, qin, or, king, zheng, of, qin, this, title, made, him, the, nominal, equal, of, the, rulers, of, shang, and, zhou, the, last, of, whose, kings, had, been, deposed, by, king, zhaoxiang, of, qin, in, 256, bc, following, the, surrender, of, qi, in, 221, bc, king, zheng, reunited, all, of, the, lands, of, the, former, kingdom, of, zhou, rather, than, maintain, his, rank, as, king, however, he, created, a, new, title, of, hu, ngd, emperor, for, himself, this, new, title, combined, two, titles, hu, ng, of, the, mythical, three, sovereigns, s, n, hu, ng, and, the, d, of, the, legendary, five, emperors, w, d, of, chinese, prehistory, the, title, was, intended, to, appropriate, some, of, the, prestige, of, the, yellow, emperor, whose, cult, was, popular, in, the, later, warring, states, period, and, who, was, considered, to, be, a, founder, of, the, chinese, people, king, zheng,

for, that, reason, sinologists, starting, with, peter, a, boodberg, or, edward, h, schafer, sometimes, translate, it, as, thearch, and, the, first, emperor, as, the, first, thearch, the, first, emperor, intended, that, his, realm, would, remain, intact, through, the, ages, but, following, its, overthrow, and, replacement, by, han, after, his, death, it, became, customary, to, prefix, his,

time, was, residing, at, the, court, of, zhao, serving, as, a, hostage, to, guarantee, the, armistice, between, qin, and, zhao, prince, yiren, had, fallen, in, love, at, first, sight, with, a, concubine, of, l, buwei, a, rich, merchant, from, the, state, of, wey, l, consented, for, her, to, be, yiren, s, wife, who, then, became, known, as, lady, zhao, after, the, state, of, zhao, he, was, given, the, name, zhao, zheng, the, name, zheng, came, from, his, month, of, birth, zhengyue, the, first, month, of, the, chinese, lunar, calendar, the, clan, name, of, zhao, came, from, his, father,

yiren, but, that, of, l, buwei, according, to, this, account, when, l, buwei, introduced, the, dancing, girl, to, the, prince, she, was, l, buwei, s, concubine, and, had, already, become, pregnant, by, him, and, the, baby, was, born, after, an, unusually, long, period, of, pregnancy, according, to, translations, of, the, l, shi, chunqiu, zhao, ji, gave, birth, to, the, future, emperor, in, the, city, of, handan, in, 259, bc, the, first, month, of, the, 48th, year, of, king, zhaoxiang, of, qin, the, idea, that, the, emperor, was, an, illegitimate, child, widely, believed, throughout, chinese, history, contributed, to, the, generally, negative, view, of, the, first, emperor, however, a, number, of, modern, scholars, have, doubted, this, account, of, his, birth, sinologist, derk, bodde, wrote, there, is, good, reason, for, believing, that, the, sentence, describing, this, unusual, pregnancy, is, an, interpolation, added, to, the, shiji, by, an, unknown, person, in, order, to, slander, the, first, emperor, and, indicate, his, political, as, well, as, natal, illegitimacy, john, knoblock, and, jeffrey, riegel, in, their, translation, of, l, buwei, s, l, shi, chunqiu, call, the, story, patently, false, meant, both, to, libel, l, and, to, cast, aspersions, on, the, first, emperor, claiming, l, buwei, a, merchant, as, the, first, emperor, s, biological, father, was, meant, to, be, especially, disparaging, since, later, confucian, society, regarded, merchants, as, the, lowest, social, class, in, 246, bc, when, king, zhuangxiang, died, after, a, short, reign, of, just,

failures, jia, yi, wrote, that, qin, from, a, tiny, base, had, become, a, great, power, ruling, the, land, and, receiving, homage, from, all, quarters, for, a, hundred, odd, years, yet, after, they, unified, the, land, and, secured, themselves, within, the, pass, a, single, common, rustic, could, nevertheless, challenge, this, empire, why, because, the, ruler, lacked, humaneness, and, rightness, because, preserving, power, differs, fundamentally, from, seizing, power, in, the, modern, period, assessments, began, to, emerge, that, differed, from, those, of, traditional, historiography, the,

historian, ma, feibai, published, in, 1941, a, full, length, revisionist, biography, of, the, first, emperor, entitled, q, n, sh, hu, ngd, zhu, n, calling, him, one, of, the, great, heroes, of, chinese, history, ma, compared, him, with, the, contemporary, leader, chiang, kai, shek, and, saw, many, parallels, in, the, careers, and, policies, of, the, two, men, both, of, whom, he, admired, chiang, s, northern, expedition, of, the, late, 1920s, which, directly, preceded, the, new, nationalist, government, at, nanjing, was, compared, to, the, unification, brought, about, by, qin, shi, huang, with, the, advent, of, the, chinese, communist, revolution, and, the, establishment, of, a, new, revolutionary, regime, in, 1949, another, re, evaluation, of, the, first, emperor, emerged, as, a, marxist, critique, this, new, interpretation, of, qin, shi, huang, was, generally, a, combination, of, traditional, and, modern, views, but, essentially, critical, this, is, exemplified, in, the, complete, history, of, china, which, was, compiled, in, september, 1955, as, an, official, survey, of, chinese, history, the, work, described, the, first, emperor, s, major, steps, toward, unification, and, standardisation, as, corresponding, to, the, interests, of, the, ruling, group, and, the, merchant, class, not, of, the, nation, or, the, people, and, the, subsequent, fall, of, his, dynasty, as, a, manifestation, of, the, class, struggle, the, perennial, debate, about, the, fall, of, the, qin, dynasty, was, also, explained, in, marxist, terms, the, peasant, rebellions, being, a, revolt, against, oppression, a, revolt, which, undermined, the, dynasty, but, which, was, bound, to, fail, because, of, a, compromise, with, landlord, class, elements, since, 1972, however, a, radically, different, official, view, of, qin, shi, huang, in, accordance, with, maoist, thought, has, been, given, prominence, throughout, china, hong, shidi, s, biography, qin, shi, huang, initiated, the, re, evaluation, the, work, was, published, by, the, state, press, as, a, mass, popular, history, and, it, sold, 1, 85, million, copies, within, two, years, in, the, new, era, qin, shi, huang, was, seen, as, a, far, sighted, ruler, who, destroyed, the, forces, of, division, and, established, the, first, unified, centralized, state, in, chinese, history, by, rejecting, the, past, personal, attributes, such, as, his, quest, for, immortality, so, emphasized, in, traditional, historiography, were, scarcely, mentioned, the, new, evaluations, described, approvingly, how, in, his, time, an, era, of, great, political, and, social, change, he, had, no, compunctions, against, using, violent, methods, to, crush, counter, revolutionaries, such, as, the, industrial, and, commercial, slave, owner, chancellor, l, buwei, however, he, was, criticized, for, not, being, as, thorough, as, he, should, have, been, and, as, a, result, after, his, death, hidden, subversives, under, the, leadership, of, the, chief, eunuch, zhao, gao, were, able, to, seize, power, and, use, it, to, restore, the, old, feudal, order, to, round, out, this, re, evaluation, luo, siding, put, forward, a, new, interpretation, of, the, precipitous, collapse, of, the, qin, dynasty, in, an, article, entitled, on, the, class, struggle, during, the, period, between, qin, and, han, in, a, 1974, issue, of, red, flag, to, replace, the, old, explanation, the, new, theory, claimed, that, the, cause, of, the, fall, of, qin, lay, in, the, lack, of, thoroughness, of, qin, shi, huang, s, dictatorship, over, the, reactionaries, even, to, the, extent, of, permitting, them, to, worm, their, way, into, organs, of, political, authority, and, usurp, important, posts, mao, zedong, s, persecution, of, intellectuals, was, compared, to, that, of, the, first, emperor, on, his, being, made, aware, of, having, been, compared, as, such, mao, reportedly, boasted, he, buried, 460, scholars, alive, we, have, buried, forty, six, thousand, scholars, alive, you, revile, us, for, being, qin, shi, huangs, you, are, wrong, we, have, surpassed, qin, shi, huang, a, hundredfold, when, you, berate, us, for, imitating, his, despotism, we, are, happy, to, agree, your, mistake, was, that, you, did, not, say, so, enough
