defeat, by, sher, shah, suri, however, the, safavids, differed, from, the, sunni, mughals, and, ottomans, in, following, the, shia, branch, of, islam, one, of, the, longest, standing, disputes, between, the, safavids, and, the, mughals, pertained, to, control, of, the, city, of, qandahar, in, the, hindukush, region, which, formed, the, border, between, the, two, empires, military, strategists, of, the, time, considered, the, region, to, be, militarily, significant, due, to, its, geography, the, city, which, was, administered, by, bairam, khan, at, the, time, of, akbar, s, accession, was, invaded, and, captured, by, the, persian, ruler, husain, mirza, a, cousin, of, tahmasp, i, in, 1558, shortly, afterwards, akbar, s, army, completed, its, annexation, of, kabul, and, to, further, secure, the, north, western, boundaries, of, his, empire, it, proceeded, to, qandahar, the, city, capitulated, without, resistance, on, 18, april, 1595, and, the, ruler, muzaffar, hussain, joined, akbar, s, court, subsequent, to, this, bairam, khan, sent, an, envoy, to, the, court, of, tahmasp, i, in, an, effort, to, maintain, peaceful, relations, with, the, safavids, this, gesture, was, reciprocated, and, a, cordial, relationship, prevailed, between, the, two, empires, during, the, remainder, of, the, first, two, decades, of, akbar, s, reign, the, death, of, tahmasp, i, in, 1576, resulted, in, civil, war, and, instability, in, the, safavid, empire, and, diplomatic, relations, between, the, two, empires, ceased, for, more, than, a, decade, they, were, restored, only, in, 1587, following, the, accession, of, shah, abbas, to, the, safavid, throne, diplomatic, relations, continued, to, be, maintained, between, the, safavid, and, mughal, courts, until, the, end, of, akbar, s, reign, qandahar, continued, to, remain, in, mughal, possession, and, the, hindukush, was, the, empire, s, western, frontier, for, several, decades, until, shah, jahan, s, expedition, into, badakhshan, in, 1646, vincent, arthur, smith, has, observed, that, the, merchant, mildenhall, was, employed, in, 1600, to, bear, a, letter, from, queen, elizabeth, to, akbar, requesting, liberty, to, trade, in, his, dominions, on, terms, as, good, as, those, enjoyed, by, the, portuguese, akbar, was, also, visited, by, the, french, explorer, pierre, malherbe, akbar, as, well, as, his, mother, and, other, members, of, his, family, are, believed, to, have, been, sunni, hanafi, muslims, his, early, days, were, spent, in, the, backdrop, of, an, atmosphere, in, which, liberal, sentiments, were, encouraged, and, religious, narrow, mindedness, was, frowned, upon, from, the, 15th, century, a, number, of, rulers, in, various, parts, of, the, country, adopted, a, more, liberal, policy, of, religious, tolerance, attempting, to, foster, communal, harmony, between, hindus, and, muslims, these, sentiments, were, earlier, encouraged, by, the, teachings, of, popular, saints, like, guru, nanak, kabir, and, chaitanya, and, the, verses, of, the, persian, poet, hafez, which, advocated, human, sympathy, and, a, liberal, outlook, the, timurid, ethos, of, religious, tolerance, persisted, from, the, times, of, timur, to, humayun, and, influenced, akbar, s, policy, of, tolerance, in, matters, of, religion, akbar, s, childhood, tutors, including, two, irani, shias, were, largely, above, sectarian, prejudices, and, made, a, significant, contribution, to, akbar, s, later, inclination, towards, religious, tolerance, akbar, sponsored, religious, debates, between, different, muslim, groups, sunni, shia, ismaili, and, sufis, parsis, hindus, shaivite, and, vaishnava, sikhs, jains, jews, jesuits, and, materialists, he, was, also, partial, to, sufism, he, proclaimed, that, the, wisdom, of, vedanta, is, the, wisdom, of, sufism, during, the, early, part, of, his, reign, akbar, adopted, an, attitude, of, suppression, towards, muslim, sects, that, were, condemned, by, the, orthodoxy, as, heretical, in, 1567, on, the, advice, of, shaikh, abdu, n, nabi, he, ordered, the, exhumation, of, mir, murtaza, sharifi, shirazi, a, shia, buried, in, delhi, because, of, the, grave, s, proximity, to, that, of, amir, khusrau, arguing, that, a, heretic, could, not, be, buried, so, close, to, the, grave, of, a, sunni, saint, this, reflected, a, restrictive, attitude, towards, the, shia, which, continued, to, persist, until, the, early, 1570s, he, suppressed, mahdavism, in, 1573, during, his, campaign, in, gujarat, in, the, course, of, which, the, mahdavi, leader, bandagi, miyan, sheik, mustafa, was, arrested, and, brought, in, chains, to, the, court, for, debate, and, released, after, eighteen, months, akbar, was, reportedly, angered, by, acts, of, embezzlement, by, many, high, level, muslim, clerics, as, akbar, increasingly, came, under, the, influence, of, pantheistic, sufi, mysticism, from, the, early, 1570s, his, outlook, shifted, from, orthodox, islam, as, traditionally, professed, to, a, new, concept, of, islam, that, transcended, the, limits, of, islam, consequently, during, the, latter, half, of, his, reign, he, adopted, a, policy, of, tolerance, towards, the, shias, and, declared, a, prohibition, on, shia, sunni, conflict, and, the, empire, remained, neutral, in, matters, of, internal, sectarian, conflict, in, 1579, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, referred, to, himself, as, emperor, of, islam, emir, of, the, faithful, shadow, of, god, on, earth, abul, fath, jalal, ud, din, muhammad, akbar, badshah, ghazi, whose, empire, allah, perpetuate, is, a, most, just, most, wise, and, a, most, god, fearing, ruler, in, 1580, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, the, eastern, part, of, akbar, s, empire, and, a, number, of, fatwas, declaring, akbar, to, be, a, heretic, were, issued, by, qazis, akbar, suppressed, the, rebellion, and, handed, out, severe, punishments, to, the, qazis, to, further, strengthen, his, position, in, dealing, with, the, qazis, akbar, issued, a, mazhar, or, declaration, that, was, signed, by, all, major, ulemas, in, 1579, the, mahzar, asserted, that, akbar, was, the, khalifa, of, the, age, a, higher, rank, than, that, of, a, mujtahid, in, case, of, a, difference, of, opinion, among, the, mujtahids, akbar, could, select, any, one, opinion, and, could, also, issue, decrees, that, did, not, go, against, the, nass, given, the, prevailing, islamic, sectarian, conflicts, in, various, parts, of, the, country, at, that, time, it, is, believed, that, the, mazhar, helped, stabilise, the, religious, situation, in, the, empire, it, also, helped, him, eliminate, the, religious, and, political, influence, of, the, ottoman, khalifa, over, his, subjects, thus, ensuring, their, loyalty, to, him, throughout, his, reign, akbar, was, a, patron, of, influential, muslim, scholars, such, as, mir, ahmed, nasrallah, thattvi, and, tahir, muhammad, thattvi, akbar, was, deeply, interested, in, religious, and, philosophical, matters, an, orthodox, muslim, at, the, outset, he, later, came, to, be, influenced, by, the, sufi, mysticism, that, was, being, preached, in, the, country, at, that, time, he, moved, away, from, orthodoxy, appointing, to, his, court, several, people, with, liberal, religious, philosophies, including, abul, fazl, faizi, and, birbal, in, 1575, he, built, a, hall, called, the, ibadat, khana, house, of, worship, at, fatehpur, sikri, to, which, he, invited, theologians, mystics, and, selected, courtiers, renowned, for, their, intellectual, achievements, to, discuss, matters, of, spirituality, with, them, these, discussions, initially, restricted, to, muslims, were, acrimonious, and, resulted, in, the, participants, shouting, at, and, abusing, each, other, upset, by, this, akbar, opened, the, ibadat, khana, to, people, of, all, religions, as, well, as, atheists, resulting, in, the, scope, of, the, discussions, broadening, even, extending, into, areas, such, as, the, validity, of, the, quran, and, the, nature, of, god, this, shocked, orthodox, theologians, who, sought, to, discredit, akbar, by, circulating, rumours, of, his, desire, to, forsake, islam, akbar, s, effort, to, evolve, a, meeting, point, among, the, representatives, of, various, religions, was, not, successful, as, each, of, them, attempted, to, assert, the, superiority, of, their, respective, religions, by, denouncing, other, religions, the, debates, at, the, ibadat, khana, grew, more, acrimonious, and, contrary, to, their, purpose, of, leading, to, a, better, understanding, among, religions, instead, led, to, greater, bitterness, among, them, resulting, in, the, discontinuance, of, the, debates, by, akbar, in, 1582, akbar, s, interaction, with, various, religious, theologians, had, convinced, him, that, despite, their, differences, all, religions, had, several, good, practices, which, he, sought, to, combine, into, a, new, religious, movement, known, as, din, i, ilahi, virtues, in, din, i, ilahi, included, generosity, forgiveness, abstinence, prudence, wisdom, kindness, and, piety, celibacy, was, respected, chastity, enforced, the, slaughter, of, animals, was, discouraged, and, there, were, no, sacred, scriptures, or, a, priestly, hierarchy, a, leading, noble, of, akbar, s, court, aziz, koka, wrote, a, letter, to, him, from, mecca, in, 1594, arguing, that, the, discipleship, promoted, by, akbar, amounted, to, nothing, more, than, a, desire, on, akbar, s, part, to, portray, his, superiority, regarding, religious, matters, to, commemorate, din, e, ilahi, akbar, changed, the, name, of, prayag, to, allahabad, pronounced, as, ilahabad, in, 1583, some, modern, scholars, claim, that, akbar, did, not, initiate, a, new, religion, instead, introducing, what, oscar, r, g, mez, has, called, a, transtheistic, outlook, derived, from, tantric, tibetan, buddhism, and, that, akbar, did, not, use, the, word, din, i, ilahi, scholars, have, also, argued, that, the, theory, that, din, i, ilahi, was, a, new, religion, is, a, misconception, that, arose, because, of, erroneous, translations, of, abul, fazl, s, work, by, later, british, historians, it, has, been, accepted, that, the, policy, of, sulh, e, kul, which, formed, the, essence, of, din, i, ilahi, was, adopted, by, akbar, not, merely, for, religious, purposes, but, as, a, part, of, general, imperial, administrative, policy, this, also, formed, the, basis, for, akbar, s, policy, of, religious, tolerance, at, the, time, of, akbar, s, death, in, 1605, there, were, no, signs, of, discontent, among, his, muslim, subjects, and, even, theologians, like, abdu, l, haq, accepted, that, close, ties, remained, akbar, decreed, that, hindus, who, had, been, forced, to, convert, to, islam, could, reconvert, to, hinduism, without, facing, the, death, penalty, akbar, was, well, liked, by, hindus, who, sang, religious, hymns, to, him, and, his, eulogies, akbar, practised, several, hindu, customs,

about, their, experience, at, the, mughal, court, in, sanskrit, texts, that, are, still, largely, unknown, to, mughal, historians, the, indian, supreme, court, has, cited, examples, of, the, co, existence, of, jain, and, mughal, architecture, calling, akbar, the, architect, of, modern, india, and, stating, that, he, had, great, respect, for, jainism, in, 1584, 1592, and, 1598, akbar,
