oliver, cromwell, 25, april, 1599, 3, september, 1658, was, an, english, statesman, politician, and, soldier, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, figures, in, british, history, he, came, to, prominence, during, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, initially, as, a, senior, commander, in, the, parliamentarian, army, and, latterly, as, a, politician, a, leading, advocate, of, the, execution, of, charles, i, in, january, 1649, which, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, commonwealth, of, england, he, ruled, as, lord, protector, from, december, 1653, until, his, death, in, september, 1658, although, elected, mp, for, huntingdon, in, 1628, much, of, cromwell, s, life, prior, to, 1640, was, marked, by, failure, he, briefly, contemplated, emigration, to, new, england, but, became, a, religious, independent, in, the, 1630s, and, thereafter, believed, his, successes, were, the, result, of, divine, providence, in, 1640, cromwell, was, returned, as, mp, for, cambridge, in, the, short, and, long, parliaments, he, joined, the, parliamentarian, army, when, the, first, english, civil, war, began, in, august, 1642, and, quickly, demonstrated, his, military, abilities, in, 1645, he, was, appointed, commander, of, the, new, model, army, cavalry, under, sir, thomas, fairfax, and, played, a, key, role, in, winning, the, english, civil, war, the, death, of, charles, i, and, exile, of, his, son, followed, by, military, victories, in, ireland, and, scotland, firmly, established, the, commonwealth, and, cromwell, s, dominance, of, the, new, regime, in, december, 1653, he, was, named, lord, protector, a, position, he, retained, until, his, death, in, september, 1658, when, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, richard, whose, weakness, led, to, a, power, vacuum, this, culminated, in, the, 1660, stuart, restoration, after, which, cromwell, s, body, was, removed, from, westminster, abbey, and, displayed, at, tyburn, his, head, was, placed, on, a, spike, outside, the, tower, of, london, where, it, remained, for, 30, years, and, ultimately, reburied, at, sidney, sussex, college, cambridge, in, 1960, winston, churchill, described, cromwell, as, a, military, dictator, while, others, view, him, a, hero, of, liberty, he, remains, a, controversial, figure, due, to, his, use, of, military, force, to, acquire, and, retain, political, power, his, role, in, the, execution, of, charles, i, and, the, brutality, of, his, 1649, campaign, in, ireland, the, debate, over, his, historical, reputation, continues, first, proposed, in, 1856, his, statue, outside, the, houses, of, parliament, was, not, erected, until, 1895, most, of, the, funds, being, privately, supplied, by, prime, minister, lord, rosebery, cromwell, was, born, in, huntingdon, on, 25, april, 1599, to, robert, cromwell, and, his, second, wife, elizabeth, daughter, of, william, steward, the, family, s, estate, derived, from, oliver, s, great, great, grandfather, morgan, ap, william, a, brewer, from, glamorgan, wales, who, settled, at, putney, and, married, katherine, cromwell, born, 1482, the, sister, of, thomas, cromwell, who, would, become, the, famous, chief, minister, to, henry, viii, the, cromwells, acquired, great, wealth, as, occasional, beneficiaries, of, thomas, s, administration, of, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, morgan, ap, william, was, a, son, of, william, ap, yevan, of, wales, the, family, line, continued, through, richard, williams, alias, cromwell, c, 1500, 1544, henry, williams, alias, cromwell, c, 1524, 6, january, 1604, then, to, oliver, s, father, robert, williams, alias, cromwell, c, 1560, 1617, who, married, elizabeth, steward, c, 1564, 1654, probably, in, 1591, they, had, ten, children, but, oliver, the, fifth, child, was, the, only, boy, to, survive, infancy, cromwell, s, paternal, grandfather, sir, henry, williams, was, one, of, the, two, wealthiest, landowners, in, huntingdonshire, cromwell, s, father, was, of, modest, means, but, still, a, member, of, the, landed, gentry, as, a, younger, son, with, many, siblings, robert, inherited, only, a, house, at, huntingdon, and, a, small, amount, of, land, this, land, would, have, generated, an, income, of, up, to, 300, a, year, near, the, bottom, of, the, range, of, gentry, incomes, in, 1654, cromwell, said, i, was, by, birth, a, gentleman, living, neither, in, considerable, height, nor, yet, in, obscurity, oliver, cromwell, was, baptised, on, 29, april, 1599, at, st, john, s, church, and, attended, huntingdon, grammar, school, he, went, on, to, study, at, sidney, sussex, college, cambridge, then, a, recently, founded, college, with, a, strong, puritan, ethos, he, left, in, june, 1617, without, taking, a, degree, immediately, after, his, father, s, death, early, biographers, claim, that, he, then, attended, lincoln, s, inn, but, the, inn, s, archives, retain, no, record, of, him, antonia, fraser, concludes, that, it, is, likely, that, he, did, train, at, one, of, the, london, inns, of, court, during, this, time, his, grandfather, his, father, and, two, of, his, uncles, had, attended, lincoln, s, inn, and, cromwell, sent, his, son, richard, there, in, 1647, cromwell, probably, returned, home, to, huntingdon, after, his, father, s, death, as, his, mother, was, widowed, and, his, seven, sisters, unmarried, he, would, have, been, needed, at, home, to, help, his, family, cromwell, married, elizabeth, bourchier, 1598, 1665, on, 22, august, 1620, at, st, giles, without, cripplegate, fore, street, london, elizabeth, s, father, sir, james, bourchier, was, a, london, leather, merchant, who, owned, extensive, lands, in, essex, and, had, strong, connections, with, puritan, gentry, families, there, the, marriage, brought, cromwell, into, contact, with, oliver, st, john, and, leading, members, of, london, s, merchant, community, and, behind, them, the, influence, of, the, earls, of, warwick, and, holland, a, place, in, this, influential, network, proved, crucial, to, cromwell, s, military, and, political, career, the, couple, had, nine, children, little, evidence, exists, of, cromwell, s, religion, in, his, early, years, his, 1626, letter, to, henry, downhall, an, arminian, minister, suggests, that, he, had, yet, to, be, influenced, by, radical, puritanism, but, there, is, evidence, that, cromwell, underwent, a, personal, crisis, during, the, late, 1620s, and, early, 1630s, in, 1628, he, was, elected, to, parliament, from, the, huntingdonshire, county, town, of, huntingdon, later, that, year, he, sought, treatment, for, a, variety, of, physical, and, emotional, ailments, including, valde, melancholicus, depression, from, the, swiss, born, london, doctor, th, odore, de, mayerne, in, 1629, cromwell, became, involved, in, a, dispute, among, the, gentry, of, huntingdon, involving, a, new, charter, for, the, town, as, a, result, he, was, called, before, the, privy, council, in, 1630, in, 1631, likely, as, a, result, of, the, dispute, cromwell, sold, most, of, his, properties, in, huntingdon, and, moved, to, a, farmstead, in, nearby, st, ives, this, move, a, significant, step, down, in, society, for, the, cromwells, also, had, significant, emotional, and, spiritual, impact, on, cromwell, an, extant, 1638, letter, from, him, to, his, cousin, the, wife, of, oliver, st, john, gives, an, account, of, his, spiritual, awakening, at, this, time, in, the, letter, cromwell, describing, himself, as, having, been, the, chief, of, sinners, describes, his, calling, as, among, the, congregation, of, the, firstborn, the, letter, s, language, particularly, the, inclusion, of, numerous, biblical, quotations, shows, cromwell, s, belief, that, he, was, saved, from, his, previous, sins, by, god, s, mercy, and, indicates, his, religiously, independent, beliefs, chief, among, them, that, the, reformation, had, not, gone, far, enough, that, much, of, england, was, still, living, in, sin, and, that, catholic, beliefs, and, practices, must, be, fully, removed, from, the, church, it, appears, that, in, 1634, cromwell, attempted, to, emigrate, to, what, became, the, connecticut, colony, in, the, americas, but, was, prevented, by, the, government, from, leaving, along, with, his, brother, henry, cromwell, had, kept, a, smallholding, of, chickens, and, sheep, selling, eggs, and, wool, to, support, himself, his, lifestyle, resembling, that, of, a, yeoman, farmer, in, 1636, cromwell, inherited, control, of, various, properties, in, ely, from, his, uncle, on, his, mother, s, side, and, his, uncle, s, job, as, tithe, collector, for, ely, cathedral, as, a, result, his, income, is, likely, to, have, risen, to, around, 300, 400, per, year, by, the, end, of, the, 1630s, cromwell, had, returned, to, the, ranks, of, acknowledged, gentry, he, had, become, a, committed, puritan, and, had, established, important, family, links, to, leading, families, in, london, and, essex, cromwell, became, the, member, of, parliament, for, huntingdon, in, the, parliament, of, 1628, 1629, as, a, client, of, the, montagu, family, of, hinchingbrooke, house, he, made, little, impression, parliamentary, records, show, only, one, speech, against, the, arminian, bishop, richard, neile, which, was, poorly, received, after, dissolving, this, parliament, charles, i, ruled, without, a, parliament, for, the, next, 11, years, when, charles, faced, the, scottish, rebellion, in, the, bishops, wars, lack, of, funds, forced, him, to, call, a, parliament, again, in, 1640, cromwell, was, returned, to, this, parliament, as, member, for, cambridge, but, it, lasted, for, only, three, weeks, and, became, known, as, the, short, parliament, cromwell, moved, his, family, from, ely, to, london, in, 1640, a, second, parliament, was, called, later, the, same, year, and, became, known, as, the, long, parliament, cromwell, was, again, returned, as, member, for, cambridge, as, with, the, parliament, of, 1628, 29, it, is, likely, that, he, owed, his, position, to, the, patronage, of, others, which, might, explain, why, in, the, first, week, of, the, parliament, he, was, in, charge, of, presenting, a, petition, for, the, release, of, john, lilburne, who, had, become, a, puritan, cause, c, l, bre, after, his, arrest, for, importing, religious, tracts, from, the, netherlands, for, the, long, parliament, s, first, two, years, cromwell, was, linked, to, the, godly, group, of, aristocrats, in, the, house, of, lords, and, members, of, the, house, of, commons, with, whom, he, had, established, familial, and, religious, links, in, the, 1630s, such, as, the, earls, of, essex, warwick, and, bedford, oliver, st, john, and, viscount, saye, and, sele, at, this, stage, the, group, had, an, agenda, of, reformation, the, executive, checked, by, regular, parliaments, and, the, moderate, extension, of, liberty, of, conscience, cromwell, appears, to, have, taken, a, role, in, some, of, this, group, s, political, manoeuvres, in, may, 1641, for, example, he, put, forward, the, second, reading, of, the, annual, parliaments, bill, and, he, later, took, a, role, in, drafting, the, root, and, branch, bill, for, the, abolition, of, episcopacy, failure, to, resolve, the, issues, before, the, long, parliament, led, to, armed, conflict, between, parliament, and, charles, i, in, late, 1642, the, beginning, of, the, english, civil, war, before, he, joined, parliament, s, forces, cromwell, s, only, military, experience, was, in, the, trained, bands, the, local, county, militia, he, recruited, a, cavalry, troop, in, cambridgeshire, after, blocking, a, valuable, shipment, of, silver, plate, from, cambridge, colleges, that, was, meant, for, the, king, cromwell, and, his, troop, then, rode, to, but, arrived, too, late, to, take, part, in, the, indecisive, battle, of, edgehill, on, 23, october, 1642, the, troop, was, recruited, to, be, a, full, regiment, in, the, winter, of, 1642, 43, making, up, part, of, the, eastern, association, under, the, earl, of, manchester, cromwell, gained, experience, in, successful, actions, in, east, anglia, in, 1643, notably, at, the, battle, of, gainsborough, on, 28, july, he, was, subsequently, appointed, governor, of, the, isle, of, ely, and, a, colonel, in, the, eastern, association, by, the, time, of, the, battle, of, marston, moor, in, july, 1644, cromwell, had, risen, to, the, rank, of, lieutenant, general, of, horse, in, manchester, s, army, his, cavalry, s, success, in, breaking, the, ranks, of, the, royalist, cavalry, and, then, attacking, their, infantry, from, the, rear, at, marston, moor, was, a, major, factor, in, the, parliamentarian, victory, cromwell, fought, at, the, head, of, his, troops, in, the, battle, and, was, slightly, wounded, in, the, neck, stepping, away, briefly, to, receive, treatment, but, returning, to, help, secure, the, victory, after, cromwell, s, nephew, was, killed, at, marston, moor, he, wrote, a, famous, letter, to, his, brother, in, law, marston, moor, secured, the, north, of, england, for, the, parliamentarians, but, failed, to, end, royalist, resistance, the, indecisive, outcome, of, the, second, battle, of, newbury, in, october, meant, that, by, the, end, of, 1644, the, war, still, showed, no, sign, of, ending, cromwell, s, experience, at, newbury, where, manchester, had, let, the, king, s, army, slip, out, of, an, encircling, manoeuvre, led, to, a, serious, dispute, with, manchester, whom, he, believed, to, be, less, than, enthusiastic, in, his, conduct, of, the, war, manchester, later, accused, cromwell, of, recruiting, men, of, low, birth, as, officers, in, the, army, to, which, he, replied, if, you, choose, godly, honest, men, to, be, captains, of, horse, honest, men, will, follow, them, i, would, rather, have, a, plain, russet, coated, captain, who, knows, what, he, fights, for, and, loves, what, he, knows, than, that, which, you, call, a, gentleman, and, is, nothing, else, at, this, time, cromwell, also, fell, into, dispute, with, major, general, lawrence, crawford, a, scottish, covenanter, attached, to, manchester, s, army, who, objected, to, cromwell, s, encouragement, of, unorthodox, independents, and, anabaptists, he, was, also, charged, with, familism, by, scottish, presbyterian, samuel, rutherford, in, response, to, his, letter, to, the, house, of, commons, in, 1645, at, the, critical, battle, of, naseby, in, june, 1645, the, new, model, army, smashed, the, king, s, major, army, cromwell, led, his, wing, with, great, success, at, naseby, again, routing, the, royalist, cavalry, at, the, battle, of, langport, on, 10, july, cromwell, participated, in, the, defeat, of, the, last, sizeable, royalist, field, army, naseby, and, langport, effectively, ended, the, king, s, hopes, of, victory, and, the, subsequent, parliamentarian, campaigns, involved, taking, the, remaining, fortified, royalist, positions, in, the, west, of, england, in, october, 1645, cromwell, besieged, and, took, the, wealthy, and, formidable, catholic, fortress, basing, house, later, to, be, accused, of, killing, 100, of, its, 300, man, royalist, garrison, after, its, surrender, he, also, took, part, in, successful, sieges, at, bridgwater, sherborne, bristol, devizes, and, winchester, then, spent, the, first, half, of, 1646, mopping, up, resistance, in, devon, and, cornwall, charles, i, surrendered, to, the, scots, on, 5, may, 1646, effectively, ending, the, first, english, civil, war, cromwell, and, fairfax, took, the, royalists, formal, surrender, at, oxford, in, june, in, february, 1647, cromwell, suffered, from, an, illness, that, kept, him, out, of, political, life, for, over, a, month, by, the, time, he, recovered, the, parliamentarians, were, split, over, the, issue, of, the, king, a, majority, in, both, houses, pushed, for, a, settlement, that, would, pay, off, the, scottish, army, disband, much, of, the, new, model, army, and, restore, charles, i, in, return, for, a, presbyterian, settlement, of, the, church, cromwell, rejected, the, scottish, model, of, presbyterianism, which, threatened, to, replace, one, authoritarian, hierarchy, with, another, the, new, model, army, radicalised, by, parliament, s, failure, to, pay, the, wages, it, was, owed, petitioned, against, these, changes, but, the, commons, declared, the, petition, unlawful, in, may, 1647, cromwell, was, sent, to, the, army, s, headquarters, in, saffron, walden, to, negotiate, with, them, but, failed, to, agree, in, june, 1647, a, troop, of, cavalry, under, cornet, george, joyce, seized, the, king, from, parliament, s, imprisonment, with, the, king, now, present, cromwell, was, eager, to, find, out, what, conditions, the, king, would, acquiesce, to, if, his, authority, was, restored, the, king, appeared, to, be, willing, to, compromise, so, cromwell, employed, his, son, in, law, henry, ireton, to, draw, up, proposals, for, a, constitutional, settlement, proposals, were, drafted, multiple, times, with, different, changes, until, finally, the, heads, of, proposals, pleased, cromwell, in, principle, and, allowed, for, further, negotiations, it, was, designed, to, check, the, powers, of, the, executive, to, set, up, regularly, elected, parliaments, and, to, restore, a, non, compulsory, episcopalian, settlement, many, in, the, army, such, as, the, levellers, led, by, john, lilburne, thought, this, was, not, enough, and, demanded, full, political, equality, for, all, men, leading, to, tense, debates, in, putney, during, the, autumn, of, 1647, between, fairfax, cromwell, and, ireton, on, the, one, hand, and, levellers, like, colonel, rainsborough, on, the, other, the, putney, debates, broke, up, without, reaching, a, resolution, the, failure, to, conclude, a, political, agreement, with, the, king, led, eventually, to, the, outbreak, of, the, second, english, civil, war, in, 1648, when, the, king, tried, to, regain, power, by, force, of, arms, cromwell, first, put, down, a, royalist, uprising, in, south, wales, led, by, rowland, laugharne, winning, back, chepstow, castle, on, 25, may, and, six, days, later, forcing, the, surrender, of, tenby, the, castle, at, carmarthen, was, destroyed, by, burning, the, much, stronger, castle, at, pembroke, fell, only, after, an, eight, week, siege, cromwell, dealt, leniently, with, ex, royalist, soldiers, but, less, so, with, those, who, had, formerly, been, members, of, the, parliamentary, army, john, poyer, eventually, being, executed, in, london, after, the, drawing, of, lots, cromwell, then, marched, north, to, deal, with, a, pro, royalist, scottish, army, the, engagers, who, had, invaded, england, at, preston, in, sole, command, for, the, first, time, and, with, an, army, of, 9, 000, he, won, a, decisive, victory, against, an, army, twice, as, large, during, 1648, cromwell, s, letters, and, speeches, started, to, become, heavily, based, on, biblical, imagery, many, of, them, meditations, on, the, meaning, of, particular, passages, for, example, after, the, battle, of, preston, study, of, psalms, 17, and, 105, led, him, to, tell, parliament, that, they, that, are, implacable, and, will, not, leave, troubling, the, land, may, be, speedily, destroyed, out, of, the, land, a, letter, to, oliver, st, john, in, september, 1648, urged, him, to, read, isaiah, 8, in, which, the, kingdom, falls, and, only, the, godly, survive, on, four, occasions, in, letters, in, 1648, he, referred, to, the, story, of, gideon, s, defeat, of, the, midianites, at, ain, harod, these, letters, suggest, that, it, was, cromwell, s, faith, rather, than, a, commitment, to, radical, politics, coupled, with, parliament, s, decision, to, engage, in, negotiations, with, the, king, at, the, treaty, of, newport, that, convinced, him, that, god, had, spoken, against, both, the, king, and, parliament, as, lawful, authorities, for, cromwell, the, army, was, now, god, s, chosen, instrument, the, episode, shows, cromwell, s, firm, belief, in, providentialism, that, god, was, actively, directing, the, affairs, of, the, world, through, the, actions, of, chosen, people, whom, god, had, provided, for, such, purposes, during, the, civil, wars, cromwell, believed, that, he, was, one, of, these, people, and, he, interpreted, victories, as, indications, of, god, s, approval, and, defeats, as, signs, that, god, was, pointing, him, in, another, direction, in, december, 1648, in, an, episode, that, became, known, as, pride, s, purge, a, troop, of, soldiers, headed, by, colonel, thomas, pride, forcibly, removed, from, the, long, parliament, all, those, who, were, not, supporters, of, the, grandees, in, the, new, model, army, and, the, independents, thus, weakened, the, remaining, body, of, mps, known, as, the, rump, parliament, agreed, that, charles, should, be, tried, for, treason, cromwell, was, still, in, the, north, of, england, dealing, with, royalist, resistance, when, these, events, took, place, but, then, returned, to, london, on, the, day, after, pride, s, purge, he, became, a, determined, supporter, of, those, pushing, for, the, king, s, trial, and, execution, believing, that, killing, charles, was, the, only, way, to, end, the, civil, wars, cromwell, approved, thomas, brook, s, address, to, the, house, of, commons, which, justified, the, trial, and, the, king, s, execution, on, the, basis, of, the, book, of, numbers, chapter, 35, and, particularly, verse, 33, the, land, cannot, be, cleansed, of, the, blood, that, is, shed, therein, but, by, the, blood, of, him, that, shed, it, charles, s, death, warrant, was, signed, by, 59, of, the, trying, court, s, members, including, cromwell, the, third, to, sign, it, though, it, was, not, unprecedented, execution, of, the, king, or, regicide, was, controversial, if, for, no, other, reason, than, the, doctrine, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, thus, even, after, a, trial, it, was, difficult, to, get, ordinary, men, to, go, along, with, it, none, of, the, officers, charged, with, supervising, the, execution, wanted, to, sign, the, order, for, the, actual, beheading, so, they, brought, their, dispute, to, cromwell, oliver, seized, a, pen, and, scribbled, out, the, order, and, handed, the, pen, to, the, second, officer, colonel, hacker, who, stooped, to, sign, it, the, execution, could, now, proceed, although, fairfax, conspicuously, refused, to, sign, charles, i, was, executed, on, 30, january, 1649, after, the, king, s, execution, a, republic, was, declared, known, as, the, commonwealth, of, england, the, rump, parliament, exercised, both, executive, and, legislative, powers, with, a, smaller, council, of, state, also, having, some, executive, functions, cromwell, remained, a, member, of, the, rump, and, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, council, in, the, early, months, after, charles, s, execution, cromwell, tried, but, failed, to, unite, the, original, royal, independents, led, by, st, john, and, saye, and, sele, which, had, fractured, during, 1648, cromwell, had, been, connected, to, this, group, since, before, the, outbreak, of, civil, war, in, 1642, and, had, been, closely, associated, with, them, during, the, 1640s, only, st, john, was, persuaded, to, retain, his, seat, in, parliament, the, royalists, meanwhile, had, regrouped, in, ireland, having, signed, a, treaty, with, the, irish, known, as, confederate, catholics, in, march, the, rump, chose, cromwell, to, command, a, campaign, against, them, preparations, for, an, invasion, of, ireland, occupied, him, in, the, subsequent, months, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 1640s, cromwell, came, across, political, dissidence, in, the, new, model, army, the, leveller, or, agitator, movement, was, a, political, movement, that, emphasised, popular, sovereignty, extended, suffrage, equality, before, the, law, and, religious, tolerance, these, sentiments, were, expressed, in, the, 1647, manifesto, agreement, of, the, people, cromwell, and, the, rest, of, the, grandees, disagreed, with, these, sentiments, in, that, they, gave, too, much, freedom, to, the, people, they, believed, that, the, vote, should, extend, only, to, the, landowners, in, the, putney, debates, of, 1647, the, two, groups, debated, these, topics, in, hopes, of, forming, a, new, constitution, for, england, rebellions, and, mutinies, followed, the, debates, and, in, 1649, the, bishopsgate, mutiny, resulted, in, leveller, robert, lockyer, s, execution, by, firing, squad, the, next, month, the, banbury, mutiny, occurred, with, similar, results, cromwell, led, the, charge, in, quelling, these, rebellions, after, quelling, leveller, mutinies, within, the, english, army, at, andover, and, burford, in, may, he, departed, for, ireland, from, bristol, at, the, end, of, july, cromwell, led, a, parliamentary, invasion, of, ireland, from, 1649, to, 1650, parliament, s, key, opposition, was, the, military, threat, posed, by, the, alliance, of, the, irish, confederate, catholics, and, english, royalists, signed, in, 1649, the, confederate, royalist, alliance, was, judged, to, be, the, biggest, single, threat, facing, the, commonwealth, however, the, political, situation, in, ireland, in, 1649, was, extremely, fractured, there, were, also, separate, forces, of, irish, catholics, who, were, opposed, to, the, royalist, alliance, and, protestant, royalist, forces, that, were, gradually, moving, towards, parliament, cromwell, said, in, a, speech, to, the, army, council, on, 23, march, that, i, had, rather, be, overthrown, by, a, cavalierish, interest, than, a, scotch, interest, i, had, rather, be, overthrown, by, a, scotch, interest, than, an, irish, interest, and, i, think, of, all, this, is, the, most, dangerous, cromwell, s, hostility, to, the, irish, was, religious, as, well, as, political, he, was, passionately, opposed, to, the, catholic, church, which, he, saw, as, denying, the, primacy, of, the, bible, in, favour, of, papal, and, clerical, authority, and, which, he, blamed, for, suspected, tyranny, and, persecution, of, protestants, in, continental, europe, cromwell, s, association, of, catholicism, with, persecution, was, deepened, with, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1641, this, rebellion, although, intended, to, be, bloodless, was, marked, by, massacres, of, english, and, scottish, protestant, settlers, by, irish, gaels, and, old, english, in, ireland, and, highland, scot, catholics, in, ireland, these, settlers, had, settled, on, land, seized, from, former, native, catholic, owners, to, make, way, for, the, non, native, protestants, these, factors, contributed, to, the, brutality, of, the, cromwell, military, campaign, in, ireland, parliament, had, planned, to, re, conquer, ireland, since, 1641, and, had, already, sent, an, invasion, force, there, in, 1647, cromwell, s, invasion, of, 1649, was, much, larger, and, with, the, civil, war, in, england, over, could, be, regularly, reinforced, and, re, supplied, his, nine, month, military, campaign, was, brief, and, effective, though, it, did, not, end, the, war, in, ireland, before, his, invasion, parliamentarian, forces, held, outposts, only, in, dublin, and, derry, when, he, departed, ireland, they, occupied, most, of, the, eastern, and, northern, parts, of, the, country, after, he, landed, at, dublin, on, 15, august, 1649, itself, only, recently, defended, from, an, irish, and, english, royalist, attack, at, the, battle, of, rathmines, cromwell, took, the, fortified, port, towns, of, drogheda, and, wexford, to, secure, logistical, supply, from, england, at, the, siege, of, drogheda, in, september, 1649, his, troops, killed, nearly, 3, 500, people, after, the, town, s, capture, around, 2, 700, royalist, soldiers, and, all, the, men, in, the, town, carrying, arms, including, some, civilians, prisoners, and, roman, catholic, priests, cromwell, wrote, afterwards, i, am, persuaded, that, this, is, a, righteous, judgment, of, god, upon, these, barbarous, wretches, who, have, imbrued, their, hands, in, so, much, innocent, blood, and, that, it, will, tend, to, prevent, the, effusion, of, blood, for, the, future, which, are, satisfactory, grounds, for, such, actions, which, otherwise, cannot, but, work, remorse, and, regret, at, the, siege, of, wexford, in, october, another, massacre, took, place, under, confused, circumstances, while, cromwell, was, apparently, trying, to, negotiate, surrender, terms, some, of, his, soldiers, broke, into, the, town, killed, 2, 000, irish, troops, and, up, to, 1, 500, civilians, and, burned, much, of, the, town, after, taking, drogheda, cromwell, sent, a, column, north, to, ulster, to, secure, the, north, of, the, country, and, went, on, to, besiege, waterford, kilkenny, and, clonmel, in, ireland, s, south, east, kilkenny, put, up, a, fierce, defence, but, was, eventually, forced, to, surrender, on, terms, as, did, many, other, towns, like, new, ross, and, carlow, but, cromwell, failed, to, take, waterford, and, at, the, siege, of, clonmel, in, may, 1650, he, lost, up, to, 2, 000, men, in, abortive, assaults, before, the, town, surrendered, one, of, cromwell, s, major, victories, in, ireland, was, diplomatic, rather, than, military, with, the, help, of, roger, boyle, 1st, earl, of, orrery, he, persuaded, the, protestant, royalist, troops, in, cork, to, change, sides, and, fight, with, the, parliament, at, this, point, word, reached, cromwell, that, charles, ii, son, of, charles, i, had, landed, in, scotland, from, exile, in, france, and, been, proclaimed, king, by, the, covenanter, regime, cromwell, therefore, returned, to, england, from, youghal, on, 26, may, 1650, to, counter, this, threat, the, parliamentarian, conquest, of, ireland, dragged, on, for, almost, three, years, after, cromwell, s, departure, the, campaigns, under, cromwell, s, successors, henry, ireton, and, edmund, ludlow, consisted, mostly, of, long, sieges, of, fortified, cities, and, guerrilla, warfare, in, the, countryside, with, english, troops, suffering, from, attacks, by, irish, tor, idhe, guerilla, fighters, the, last, catholic, held, town, galway, surrendered, in, april, 1652, and, the, last, irish, catholic, troops, capitulated, in, april, 1653, in, county, cavan, in, the, wake, of, the, commonwealth, s, conquest, of, the, island, of, ireland, public, practice, of, roman, catholicism, was, banned, and, catholic, priests, were, killed, when, captured, all, catholic, owned, land, was, confiscated, under, the, act, for, the, settlement, of, ireland, of, 1652, and, given, to, scottish, and, english, settlers, parliament, s, financial, creditors, and, parliamentary, soldiers, remaining, catholic, landowners, were, allocated, poorer, land, in, the, province, of, connacht, cromwell, left, ireland, in, may, 1650, and, several, months, later, invaded, scotland, after, the, scots, had, proclaimed, charles, i, s, son, charles, ii, as, king, cromwell, was, much, less, hostile, to, scottish, presbyterians, some, of, whom, had, been, his, allies, in, the, first, english, civil, war, than, he, was, to, irish, catholics, he, described, the, scots, as, a, people, fearing, his, name, though, deceived, he, made, a, famous, appeal, to, the, general, assembly, of, the, church, of, scotland, urging, them, to, see, the, error, of, the, royal, alliance, i, beseech, you, in, the, bowels, of, christ, think, it, possible, you, may, be, mistaken, the, scots, reply, was, robust, would, you, have, us, to, be, sceptics, in, our, religion, this, decision, to, negotiate, with, charles, ii, led, cromwell, to, believe, that, war, was, necessary, his, appeal, rejected, cromwell, s, veteran, troops, went, on, to, invade, scotland, at, first, the, campaign, went, badly, as, cromwell, s, men, were, short, of, supplies, and, held, up, at, fortifications, manned, by, scottish, troops, under, david, leslie, sickness, began, to, spread, in, the, ranks, cromwell, was, on, the, brink, of, evacuating, his, army, by, sea, from, dunbar, however, on, 3, september, 1650, unexpectedly, cromwell, smashed, the, main, scottish, army, at, the, battle, of, dunbar, killing, 4, 000, scottish, soldiers, taking, another, 10, 000, prisoner, and, then, capturing, the, scottish, capital, of, edinburgh, the, victory, was, of, such, a, magnitude, that, cromwell, called, it, a, high, act, of, the, lord, s, providence, to, us, one, of, the, most, signal, mercies, god, hath, done, for, england, and, his, people, the, following, year, charles, ii, and, his, scottish, allies, made, an, attempt, to, invade, england, and, capture, london, while, cromwell, was, engaged, in, scotland, cromwell, followed, them, south, and, caught, them, at, worcester, on, 3, september, 1651, and, his, forces, destroyed, the, last, major, scottish, royalist, army, at, the, battle, of, worcester, charles, ii, barely, escaped, capture, and, fled, to, exile, in, france, and, the, netherlands, where, he, remained, until, 1660, to, fight, the, battle, cromwell, organised, an, envelopment, followed, by, a, multi, pronged, coordinated, attack, on, worcester, his, forces, attacking, from, three, directions, with, two, rivers, partitioning, them, he, switched, his, reserves, from, one, side, of, the, river, severn, to, the, other, and, then, back, again, the, editor, of, the, great, rebellion, article, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, notes, that, worcester, was, a, battle, of, manoeuvre, compared, to, the, early, civil, war, battle, of, turnham, green, which, the, english, parliamentary, armies, were, unable, to, execute, at, the, start, of, the, war, and, he, suggests, that, it, was, a, prototype, for, the, battle, of, sedan, 1870, in, the, final, stages, of, the, scottish, campaign, cromwell, s, men, under, george, monck, sacked, dundee, killing, up, to, 1, 000, men, and, 140, women, and, children, scotland, was, ruled, from, england, during, the, commonwealth, and, was, kept, under, military, occupation, with, a, line, of, fortifications, sealing, off, the, highlands, which, had, provided, manpower, for, royalist, armies, in, scotland, the, northwest, highlands, was, the, scene, of, another, pro, royalist, uprising, in, 1653, 55, which, was, put, down, with, deployment, of, 6, 000, english, troops, there, presbyterianism, was, allowed, to, be, practised, as, before, but, the, kirk, the, scottish, church, did, not, have, the, backing, of, the, civil, courts, to, impose, its, rulings, as, it, had, previously, cromwell, was, away, on, campaign, from, the, middle, of, 1649, until, 1651, and, the, various, factions, in, parliament, began, to, fight, amongst, themselves, with, the, king, gone, as, their, common, cause, cromwell, tried, to, galvanise, the, rump, into, setting, dates, for, new, elections, uniting, the, three, kingdoms, under, one, polity, and, to, put, in, place, a, broad, brush, tolerant, national, church, however, the, rump, vacillated, in, setting, election, dates, although, it, put, in, place, a, basic, liberty, of, conscience, but, it, failed, to, produce, an, alternative, for, tithes, or, to, dismantle, other, aspects, of, the, existing, religious, settlement, according, to, the, parliamentarian, lawyer, bulstrode, whitelocke, cromwell, began, to, contemplate, taking, the, crown, for, himself, around, this, time, though, the, evidence, for, this, is, retrospective, and, problematic, ultimately, he, demanded, that, the, rump, establish, a, caretaker, government, in, april, 1653, of, 40, members, drawn, from, the, rump, and, the, army, and, then, abdicate, but, the, rump, returned, to, debating, its, own, bill, for, a, new, government, cromwell, was, so, angered, by, this, that, he, cleared, the, chamber, and, dissolved, the, parliament, by, force, on, 20, april, 1653, supported, by, about, 40, musketeers, several, accounts, exist, of, this, incident, in, one, cromwell, is, supposed, to, have, said, you, are, no, parliament, i, say, you, are, no, parliament, i, will, put, an, end, to, your, sitting, at, least, two, accounts, agree, that, he, snatched, up, the, ceremonial, mace, symbol, of, parliament, s, power, and, demanded, that, the, bauble, be, taken, away, his, troops, were, commanded, by, charles, worsley, later, one, of, his, major, generals, and, one, of, his, most, trusted, advisors, to, whom, he, entrusted, the, mace, after, the, dissolution, of, the, rump, power, passed, temporarily, to, a, council, that, debated, what, form, the, constitution, should, take, they, took, up, the, suggestion, of, major, general, thomas, harrison, for, a, sanhedrin, of, saints, although, cromwell, did, not, subscribe, to, harrison, s, apocalyptic, fifth, monarchist, beliefs, which, saw, a, sanhedrin, as, the, starting, point, for, christ, s, rule, on, earth, he, was, attracted, by, the, idea, of, an, assembly, made, up, of, men, chosen, for, their, religious, credentials, in, his, speech, during, the, assembly, on, 4, july, cromwell, thanked, god, s, providence, that, he, believed, had, brought, england, to, this, point, and, set, out, their, divine, mission, truly, god, hath, called, you, to, this, work, by, i, think, as, wonderful, providences, as, ever, passed, upon, the, sons, of, men, in, so, short, a, time, the, nominated, assembly, sometimes, known, as, the, parliament, of, saints, or, more, commonly, and, denigratingly, called, barebone, s, parliament, after, one, of, its, members, praise, god, barebone, was, tasked, with, finding, a, permanent, constitutional, and, religious, settlement, cromwell, was, invited, to, be, a, member, but, declined, however, the, revelation, that, a, considerably, larger, segment, of, the, membership, than, had, been, believed, were, the, radical, fifth, monarchists, led, to, its, members, voting, to, dissolve, it, on, 12, december, 1653, out, of, fear, of, what, the, radicals, might, do, if, they, took, control, of, the, assembly, after, barebone, s, parliament, was, dissolved, john, lambert, put, forward, a, new, constitution, known, as, the, instrument, of, government, closely, modelled, on, the, heads, of, proposals, this, made, cromwell, undertake, the, chief, magistracy, and, the, administration, of, government, later, he, was, sworn, as, lord, protector, on, 16, december, with, a, ceremony, in, which, he, wore, plain, black, clothing, rather, than, any, monarchical, regalia, cromwell, also, changed, his, signature, to, oliver, p, with, the, p, being, an, abbreviation, for, protector, and, soon, others, started, to, address, cromwell, as, your, highness, as, protector, he, had, to, secure, a, majority, vote, in, the, council, of, state, as, the, lord, protector, he, was, paid, 100, 000, a, year, equivalent, to, 20, 500, 000, in, 2023, although, cromwell, stated, that, government, by, one, man, and, a, parliament, is, fundamental, he, believed, that, social, issues, should, be, prioritised, the, social, priorities, did, not, include, any, meaningful, attempt, to, reform, the, social, order, small, scale, reform, such, as, that, carried, out, on, the, judicial, system, were, outweighed, by, attempts, to, restore, order, to, english, politics, tax, slightly, decreased, and, he, prioritise, peaced, and, ending, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, england, s, overseas, possessions, in, this, period, included, newfoundland, the, new, england, confederation, the, providence, plantation, the, virginia, colony, the, province, of, maryland, and, islands, in, the, west, indies, cromwell, soon, secured, the, submission, of, these, and, largely, left, them, to, their, own, affairs, intervening, only, to, curb, other, puritans, who, had, seized, control, of, maryland, colony, at, severn, battle, by, his, confirming, the, former, roman, catholic, proprietorship, and, edict, of, tolerance, there, of, all, the, english, dominions, virginia, was, the, most, resentful, of, cromwell, s, rule, and, cavalier, emigration, there, mushroomed, during, the, protectorate, cromwell, famously, stressed, the, quest, to, restore, order, in, his, speech, to, the, first, protectorate, parliament, however, the, parliament, was, quickly, dominated, by, those, pushing, for, more, radical, properly, republican, reforms, later, the, parliament, initiated, radical, reform, rather, than, opposing, parliament, s, bill, cromwell, dissolved, them, on, 22, january, 1655, the, first, protectorate, parliament, had, a, property, franchise, of, 200, per, annum, in, real, or, personal, property, value, set, as, the, minimum, value, in, which, a, male, adult, was, to, possess, before, he, was, eligible, to, vote, for, the, representatives, from, the, counties, or, shires, in, the, house, of, commons, the, house, of, commons, representatives, from, the, boroughs, were, elected, by, the, burgesses, or, those, borough, residents, who, had, the, right, to, vote, in, municipal, elections, and, by, the, aldermen, and, councilors, of, the, boroughs, cromwell, s, second, objective, was, reforms, on, the, field, of, morality, and, religion, as, a, protectorate, he, established, trials, for, the, future, parish, ministers, and, dismissed, unqualified, ministers, and, rectors, these, triers, and, the, ejectors, were, intended, to, be, at, the, vanguard, of, cromwell, s, reform, of, parish, worship, this, second, objective, is, also, the, context, in, which, to, see, the, constitutional, experiment, of, the, major, generals, that, followed, the, dissolution, of, the, first, protectorate, parliament, after, a, royalist, uprising, in, march, 1655, led, by, sir, john, penruddock, cromwell, influenced, by, lambert, divided, england, into, military, districts, ruled, by, army, major, generals, who, answered, only, to, him, the, 15, major, generals, and, deputy, major, generals, called, godly, governors, were, central, not, only, to, national, security, but, also, viewed, as, cromwell, s, serious, effort, in, exerting, his, religious, conviction, their, position, was, further, harmed, by, a, tax, proposal, by, major, general, john, desborough, to, provide, financial, backing, for, their, work, which, the, second, protectorate, parliament, instated, in, september, 1656, voted, down, for, fear, of, a, permanent, military, state, ultimately, however, cromwell, s, failure, to, support, his, men, sacrificing, them, to, his, opponents, caused, their, demise, their, activities, between, november, 1655, and, september, 1656, had, however, reopened, the, wounds, of, the, 1640s, and, deepened, antipathies, to, the, regime, in, late, 1654, cromwell, launched, the, western, design, armada, against, the, spanish, west, indies, and, in, may, 1655, captured, jamaica, as, lord, protector, cromwell, was, aware, of, the, jewish, community, s, involvement, in, the, economics, of, the, netherlands, now, england, s, leading, commercial, rival, it, was, this, allied, to, cromwell, s, tolerance, of, the, right, to, private, worship, of, those, who, fell, outside, puritanism, that, led, to, his, encouraging, jews, to, return, to, england, in, 1657, over, 350, years, after, their, banishment, by, edward, i, in, the, hope, that, they, would, help, speed, up, the, recovery, of, the, country, after, the, disruption, of, the, civil, wars, there, was, a, longer, term, motive, for, cromwell, s, decision, to, allow, the, jews, to, return, to, england, and, that, was, the, hope, that, they, would, convert, to, christianity, and, therefore, hasten, the, second, coming, of, jesus, christ, ultimately, based, on, matthew, 23, 37, 39, and, romans, 11, at, the, whitehall, conference, of, december, 1655, he, quoted, from, st, paul, s, epistle, to, the, romans, 10, 12, 15, on, the, need, to, send, christian, preachers, to, the, jews, the, presbyterian, william, prynne, in, contrast, to, the, congregationalist, cromwell, was, strongly, opposed, to, the, latter, s, pro, jewish, policy, on, 23, march, 1657, the, protectorate, signed, the, treaty, of, paris, with, louis, xiv, against, spain, cromwell, pledged, to, supply, france, with, 6, 000, troops, and, war, ships, in, accordance, with, the, terms, of, the, treaty, mardyck, and, dunkirk, a, base, for, privateers, and, commerce, raiders, attacking, english, merchant, shipping, were, ceded, to, england, in, 1657, cromwell, was, offered, the, crown, by, parliament, as, part, of, a, revised, constitutional, settlement, presenting, him, with, a, dilemma, since, he, had, been, instrumental, in, abolishing, the, monarchy, cromwell, agonised, for, six, weeks, over, the, offer, he, was, attracted, by, the, prospect, of, stability, it, held, out, but, in, a, speech, on, 13, april, 1657, he, made, clear, that, god, s, providence, had, spoken, against, the, office, of, king, i, would, not, seek, to, set, up, that, which, providence, hath, destroyed, and, laid, in, the, dust, and, i, would, not, build, jericho, again, the, reference, to, jericho, harks, back, to, a, previous, occasion, on, which, cromwell, had, wrestled, with, his, conscience, when, the, news, reached, england, of, the, defeat, of, an, expedition, against, the, spanish, held, island, of, hispaniola, in, the, west, indies, in, 1655, comparing, himself, to, achan, who, had, brought, the, israelites, defeat, after, bringing, plunder, back, to, camp, after, the, capture, of, jericho, instead, cromwell, was, re, installed, as, lord, protector, on, 26, june, at, westminster, hall, and, sitting, on, king, edward, s, chair, he, imitated, a, royal, coronation, as, he, wore, many, royal, regalia, such, as, a, purple, robe, a, sword, of, justice, and, a, sceptre, cromwell, s, new, rights, and, powers, were, laid, out, in, the, humble, petition, and, advice, a, legislative, instrument, which, replaced, the, instrument, of, government, despite, failing, to, restore, the, crown, this, new, constitution, did, set, up, many, of, the, vestiges, of, the, ancient, constitution, including, a, house, of, life, peers, in, the, humble, petition, it, was, called, the, other, house, as, the, commons, could, not, agree, on, a, suitable, name, furthermore, oliver, cromwell, increasingly, took, on, more, of, the, trappings, of, monarchy, in, particular, he, created, three, peerages, after, a, petition, and, advised, charles, howard, to, be, appointed, as, viscount, morpeth, and, baron, gisland, in, july, meanwhile, edmund, dunch, being, appointed, as, baron, burnell, of, east, wittenham, in, april, next, year, cromwell, is, thought, to, have, suffered, from, malaria, and, kidney, stone, disease, in, 1658, he, was, struck, by, a, sudden, bout, of, malarial, fever, and, it, is, thought, that, he, may, have, rejected, the, only, known, treatment, quinine, because, it, had, been, discovered, by, catholic, jesuit, missionaries, this, was, followed, directly, by, illness, symptomatic, of, a, urinary, or, kidney, complaint, the, venetian, ambassador, wrote, regular, dispatches, to, the, doge, of, venice, in, which, he, included, details, of, cromwell, s, final, illness, and, he, was, suspicious, of, the, rapidity, of, his, death, the, decline, may, have, been, hastened, by, the, death, of, his, daughter, elizabeth, claypole, in, august, he, died, at, age, 59, at, whitehall, on, 3, september, 1658, the, anniversary, of, his, great, victories, at, dunbar, and, worcester, the, night, of, his, death, a, great, storm, swept, england, and, all, over, europe, the, most, likely, cause, of, death, was, sepsis, blood, poisoning, following, his, urinary, infection, he, was, buried, with, great, ceremony, at, what, is, now, the, raf, chapel, with, an, elaborate, funeral, at, westminster, abbey, based, on, that, of, james, i, his, daughter, elizabeth, also, being, buried, there, cromwell, was, succeeded, as, lord, protector, by, his, son, richard, richard, had, no, power, base, in, parliament, or, the, army, and, was, forced, to, resign, in, may, 1659, ending, the, protectorate, there, was, no, clear, leadership, from, the, various, factions, that, jostled, for, power, during, the, reinstated, commonwealth, so, george, monck, was, able, to, march, on, london, at, the, head, of, new, model, army, regiments, and, restore, the, long, parliament, under, monck, s, watchful, eye, the, necessary, constitutional, adjustments, were, made, so, that, charles, ii, could, be, invited, back, from, exile, in, 1660, to, be, king, under, a, restored, monarchy, cromwell, s, body, was, exhumed, from, westminster, abbey, on, 30, january, 1661, the, 12th, anniversary, of, the, execution, of, charles, i, and, was, subjected, to, a, posthumous, execution, as, were, the, remains, of, john, bradshaw, and, henry, ireton, the, body, of, cromwell, s, daughter, was, allowed, to, remain, buried, in, the, abbey, his, body, was, hanged, in, chains, at, tyburn, london, and, then, thrown, into, a, pit, his, head, was, cut, off, and, displayed, on, a, pole, outside, westminster, hall, until, 1685, afterwards, it, was, owned, by, various, people, including, a, documented, sale, in, 1814, to, josiah, henry, wilkinson, and, it, was, publicly, exhibited, several, times, before, being, buried, beneath, the, floor, of, the, antechapel, at, sidney, sussex, college, cambridge, in, 1960, the, exact, position, was, not, publicly, disclosed, but, a, plaque, marks, the, approximate, location, many, people, began, to, question, whether, the, body, mutilated, at, tyburn, and, the, head, seen, on, westminster, hall, were, cromwell, s, these, doubts, arose, because, it, was, assumed, that, cromwell, s, body, was, reburied, in, several, places, between, his, death, in, september, 1658, and, the, exhumation, of, january, 1661, in, order, to, protect, it, from, vengeful, royalists, the, stories, suggest, that, his, bodily, remains, are, buried, in, london, cambridgeshire, northamptonshire, or, yorkshire, the, cromwell, vault, was, later, used, as, a, burial, place, for, charles, ii, s, illegitimate, descendants, in, westminster, abbey, the, site, of, cromwell, s, burial, was, marked, during, the, 19th, century, by, a, floor, stone, in, what, is, now, the, raf, chapel, reading, the, burial, place, of, oliver, cromwell, 1658, 1661, during, his, lifetime, some, tracts, painted, cromwell, as, a, hypocrite, motivated, by, power, for, example, the, machiavilian, cromwell, and, the, juglers, discovered, are, parts, of, an, attack, on, cromwell, by, the, levellers, after, 1647, and, both, present, him, as, a, machiavellian, figure, john, spittlehouse, presented, a, more, positive, assessment, in, a, warning, piece, discharged, comparing, him, to, moses, rescuing, the, english, by, taking, them, safely, through, the, red, sea, of, the, civil, wars, poet, john, milton, called, cromwell, our, chief, of, men, in, his, sonnet, xvi, several, biographies, were, published, soon, after, cromwell, s, death, an, example, is, the, perfect, politician, which, describes, how, cromwell, loved, men, more, than, books, and, provides, a, nuanced, assessment, of, him, as, an, energetic, campaigner, for, liberty, of, conscience, who, is, brought, down, by, pride, and, ambition, an, equally, nuanced, but, less, positive, assessment, was, published, in, 1667, by, edward, hyde, 1st, earl, of, clarendon, in, his, history, of, the, rebellion, and, civil, wars, in, england, clarendon, famously, declares, that, cromwell, will, be, looked, upon, by, posterity, as, a, brave, bad, man, he, argues, that, cromwell, s, rise, to, power, had, been, helped, by, his, great, spirit, and, energy, but, also, by, his, ruthlessness, clarendon, was, not, one, of, cromwell, s, confidantes, and, his, account, was, written, after, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, during, the, early, 18th, century, cromwell, s, image, began, to, be, adopted, and, reshaped, by, the, whigs, as, part, of, a, wider, project, to, give, their, political, objectives, historical, legitimacy, john, toland, rewrote, edmund, ludlow, s, memoirs, in, order, to, remove, the, puritan, elements, and, replace, them, with, a, whiggish, brand, of, republicanism, and, it, presents, the, cromwellian, protectorate, as, a, military, tyranny, through, ludlow, toland, portrayed, cromwell, as, a, despot, who, crushed, the, beginnings, of, democratic, rule, in, the, 1640s, i, hope, to, render, the, english, name, as, great, and, formidable, as, ever, the, roman, was, during, the, early, 19th, century, cromwell, began, to, be, portrayed, in, a, positive, light, by, romantic, artists, and, poets, thomas, carlyle, continued, this, reassessment, in, the, 1840s, publishing, oliver, cromwell, s, letters, and, speeches, with, elucidations, an, annotated, collection, of, his, letters, and, speeches, in, which, he, described, english, puritanism, as, the, last, of, all, our, heroisms, while, taking, a, negative, view, of, his, own, era, by, the, late, 19th, century, carlyle, s, portrayal, of, cromwell, had, become, assimilated, into, whig, and, liberal, historiography, stressing, the, centrality, of, puritan, morality, and, earnestness, oxford, civil, war, historian, samuel, rawson, gardiner, concluded, that, the, man, it, is, ever, so, with, the, noblest, was, greater, than, his, work, gardiner, stressed, cromwell, s, dynamic, and, mercurial, character, and, his, role, in, dismantling, absolute, monarchy, rather, than, his, religious, conviction, cromwell, s, foreign, policy, also, provided, an, attractive, forerunner, of, victorian, imperial, expansion, with, gardiner, stressing, his, constancy, of, effort, to, make, england, great, by, land, and, sea, calvin, coolidge, described, cromwell, as, a, brilliant, statesman, who, dared, to, oppose, the, tyranny, of, the, kings, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, cromwell, s, reputation, was, often, influenced, by, the, rise, of, fascism, in, nazi, germany, and, in, italy, harvard, historian, wilbur, cortez, abbott, for, example, devoted, much, of, his, career, to, compiling, and, editing, a, multi, volume, collection, of, cromwell, s, letters, and, speeches, published, between, 1937, and, 1947, abbott, argues, that, cromwell, was, a, proto, fascist, however, subsequent, historians, such, as, john, morrill, have, criticised, both, abbott, s, interpretation, of, cromwell, and, his, editorial, approach, late, 20th, century, historians, re, examined, the, nature, of, cromwell, s, faith, and, of, his, authoritarian, regime, austin, woolrych, explored, the, issue, of, dictatorship, in, depth, arguing, that, cromwell, was, subject, to, two, conflicting, forces, his, obligation, to, the, army, and, his, desire, to, achieve, a, lasting, settlement, by, winning, back, the, confidence, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, he, argued, that, the, dictatorial, elements, of, cromwell, s, rule, stemmed, less, from, its, military, origin, or, the, participation, of, army, officers, in, civil, government, than, from, his, constant, commitment, to, the, interest, of, the, people, of, god, and, his, conviction, that, suppressing, vice, and, encouraging, virtue, constituted, the, chief, end, of, government, historians, such, as, john, morrill, blair, worden, and, j, c, davis, have, developed, this, theme, revealing, the, extent, to, which, cromwell, s, writing, and, speeches, are, suffused, with, biblical, references, and, arguing, that, his, radical, actions, were, driven, by, his, zeal, for, godly, reformation, the, extent, of, cromwell, s, brutality, in, ireland, has, been, strongly, debated, some, historians, argue, that, cromwell, never, accepted, responsibility, for, the, killing, of, civilians, in, ireland, claiming, that, he, had, acted, harshly, but, only, against, those, in, arms, other, historians, cite, cromwell, s, contemporary, reports, to, london, including, that, of, 27, september, 1649, in, which, he, lists, the, slaying, of, 3, 000, military, personnel, followed, by, the, phrase, and, many, inhabitants, in, september, 1649, he, justified, his, sacking, of, drogheda, as, revenge, for, the, massacres, of, protestant, settlers, in, ulster, in, 1641, calling, the, massacre, the, righteous, judgement, of, god, on, these, barbarous, wretches, who, have, imbrued, their, hands, with, so, much, innocent, blood, but, the, rebels, had, not, held, drogheda, in, 1641, many, of, its, garrison, were, in, fact, english, royalists, on, the, other, hand, the, worst, atrocities, committed, in, ireland, such, as, mass, evictions, killings, and, deportation, of, over, 50, 000, men, women, and, children, as, prisoners, of, war, and, indentured, servants, to, bermuda, and, barbados, were, carried, out, under, the, command, of, other, generals, after, cromwell, had, left, for, england, some, point, to, his, actions, on, entering, ireland, cromwell, demanded, that, no, supplies, be, seized, from, civilian, inhabitants, and, that, everything, be, fairly, purchased, i, do, hereby, warn, all, officers, soldiers, and, others, under, my, command, not, to, do, any, wrong, or, violence, toward, country, people, or, any, persons, whatsoever, unless, they, be, actually, in, arms, or, office, with, the, enemy, as, they, shall, answer, to, the, contrary, at, their, utmost, peril, the, massacres, at, drogheda, and, wexford, were, in, some, ways, typical, of, the, day, especially, in, the, context, of, the, recently, ended, thirty, years, war, although, there, are, few, comparable, incidents, during, the, civil, wars, in, england, or, scotland, which, were, fought, mainly, between, protestant, adversaries, albeit, of, differing, denominations, one, possible, comparison, is, cromwell, s, siege, of, basing, house, in, 1645, the, seat, of, the, prominent, catholic, the, marquess, of, winchester, which, resulted, in, about, 100, of, the, garrison, of, 400, being, killed, after, being, refused, quarter, contemporaries, also, reported, civilian, casualties, six, catholic, priests, and, a, woman, the, scale, of, the, deaths, at, basing, house, was, much, smaller, cromwell, himself, said, of, the, slaughter, at, drogheda, in, his, first, letter, back, to, the, council, of, state, i, believe, we, put, to, the, sword, the, whole, number, of, the, defendants, i, do, not, think, thirty, of, the, whole, number, escaped, with, their, lives, cromwell, s, orders, in, the, heat, of, the, action, i, forbade, them, to, spare, any, that, were, in, arms, in, the, town, followed, a, request, for, surrender, at, the, start, of, the, siege, which, was, refused, the, military, protocol, of, the, day, was, that, a, town, or, garrison, that, rejected, the, chance, to, surrender, was, not, entitled, to, quarter, the, refusal, of, the, garrison, at, drogheda, to, do, this, even, after, the, walls, had, been, breached, was, to, cromwell, justification, for, the, massacre, where, cromwell, negotiated, the, surrender, of, fortified, towns, as, at, carlow, new, ross, and, clonmel, some, historians, argue, that, he, respected, the, terms, of, surrender, and, protected, the, townspeople, s, lives, and, property, at, wexford, he, again, began, negotiations, for, surrender, the, captain, of, wexford, castle, surrendered, during, the, negotiations, and, in, the, confusion, some, of, cromwell, s, troops, began, indiscriminate, killing, and, looting, although, cromwell, s, time, spent, on, campaign, in, ireland, was, limited, and, he, did, not, take, on, executive, powers, until, 1653, he, is, often, the, central, focus, of, wider, debates, about, whether, as, historians, such, as, mark, levene, and, john, morrill, suggest, the, commonwealth, conducted, a, deliberate, programme, of, ethnic, cleansing, in, ireland, faced, with, the, prospect, of, an, irish, alliance, with, charles, ii, cromwell, carried, out, a, series, of, massacres, to, subdue, the, irish, then, once, cromwell, had, returned, to, england, the, english, commissary, general, henry, ireton, cromwell, s, son, in, law, and, key, adviser, adopted, a, deliberate, policy, of, crop, burning, and, starvation, total, excess, deaths, for, the, entire, period, of, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, in, ireland, was, estimated, by, sir, william, petty, the, 17th, century, economist, to, be, 600, 000, out, of, a, total, irish, population, of, 1, 400, 000, in, 1641, the, sieges, of, drogheda, and, wexford, have, been, prominently, mentioned, in, histories, and, literature, up, to, the, present, day, james, joyce, for, example, mentioned, drogheda, in, his, novel, ulysses, what, about, sanctimonious, cromwell, and, his, ironsides, that, put, the, women, and, children, of, drogheda, to, the, sword, with, the, bible, text, god, is, love, pasted, round, the, mouth, of, his, cannon, similarly, winston, churchill, writing, in, 1957, described, cromwell, s, impact, on, anglo, irish, relations, upon, all, of, these, cromwell, s, record, was, a, lasting, bane, by, an, uncompleted, process, of, terror, by, an, iniquitous, land, settlement, by, the, virtual, proscription, of, the, catholic, religion, by, the, bloody, deeds, already, described, he, cut, new, gulfs, between, the, nations, and, the, creeds, hell, or, connaught, were, the, terms, he, thrust, upon, the, native, inhabitants, and, they, for, their, part, across, three, hundred, years, have, used, as, their, keenest, expression, of, hatred, the, curse, of, cromwell, on, you, upon, all, of, us, there, still, lies, the, curse, of, cromwell, a, key, surviving, statement, of, cromwell, s, views, on, the, conquest, of, ireland, is, his, declaration, of, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, for, the, undeceiving, of, deluded, and, seduced, people, of, january, 1650, in, this, he, was, scathing, about, catholicism, saying, i, shall, not, where, i, have, the, power, suffer, the, exercise, of, the, mass, but, he, also, wrote, as, for, the, people, what, thoughts, they, have, in, the, matter, of, religion, in, their, own, breasts, i, cannot, reach, but, i, shall, think, it, my, duty, if, they, walk, honestly, and, peaceably, not, to, cause, them, in, the, least, to, suffer, for, the, same, private, soldiers, who, surrendered, their, arms, and, shall, live, peaceably, and, honestly, at, their, several, homes, they, shall, be, permitted, so, to, do, in, 1965, the, irish, minister, for, lands, stated, that, his, policies, were, necessary, to, undo, the, work, of, cromwell, circa, 1997, taoiseach, bertie, ahern, demanded, that, a, portrait, of, cromwell, be, removed, from, a, room, in, the, foreign, office, before, he, began, a, meeting, with, robin, cook, cromwell, was, credited, for, the, formation, of, the, new, model, army, partly, in, response, to, the, failure, to, capitalise, on, their, victory, at, marston, moor, parliament, passed, the, self, denying, ordinance, in, early, 1645, this, forced, members, of, the, house, of, commons, and, the, lords, such, as, manchester, to, choose, between, civil, office, and, military, command, all, of, them, except, cromwell, whose, commission, was, given, continued, extensions, and, was, allowed, to, remain, in, parliament, chose, to, renounce, their, military, positions, the, ordinance, also, decreed, that, the, army, be, remodelled, on, a, national, basis, replacing, the, old, county, associations, cromwell, contributed, significantly, to, these, military, reforms, in, april, 1645, the, new, model, army, finally, took, to, the, field, with, sir, thomas, fairfax, in, command, and, cromwell, as, lieutenant, general, of, cavalry, and, second, in, command, cromwell, in, contrast, to, fairfax, had, no, formal, training, in, military, tactics, and, followed, the, common, practice, of, ranging, his, cavalry, in, three, ranks, and, pressing, forward, relying, on, impact, rather, than, firepower, his, strengths, were, an, instinctive, ability, to, lead, and, train, his, men, and, his, moral, authority, in, a, war, fought, mostly, by, amateurs, these, strengths, were, significant, and, most, likely, contributed, to, the, discipline, of, his, cavalry, cromwell, introduced, close, order, cavalry, formations, with, troopers, riding, knee, to, knee, this, was, an, innovation, in, england, at, the, time, and, a, major, factor, in, his, success, he, kept, his, troops, close, together, after, skirmishes, where, they, had, gained, superiority, rather, than, allowing, them, to, chase, opponents, off, the, battlefield, this, facilitated, further, engagements, in, short, order, which, allowed, greater, intensity, and, quick, reaction, to, battle, developments, this, style, of, command, was, decisive, at, both, marston, moor, and, naseby, alan, marshall, was, critical, for, cromwell, s, approach, to, warfare, i, e, the, war, of, annihilation, style, which, usually, brought, swift, victory, but, also, contained, high, risk, marshall, notes, cromwell, s, shortcomings, in, ireland, highlighting, his, defeat, at, clonmel, and, condemning, his, act, at, drogheda, as, an, appalling, atrocity, even, by, seventeenth, century, standards, marshall, and, other, historians, saw, cromwell, as, was, less, proficient, in, the, field, of, manoeuvre, attrition, warfare, and, at, siege, warfare, marshall, also, argues, that, cromwell, was, not, truly, revolutionary, in, his, war, strategies, instead, he, observes, cromwell, as, a, courageous, and, energetic, commander, with, an, eye, for, discipline, and, logistics, however, marshall, also, suggests, that, cromwell, s, military, proficiency, had, improved, significantly, by, 1644, 45, and, that, he, operated, efficiently, during, the, operations, of, those, years, marshall, also, points, out, that, cromwell, s, political, career, was, shapen, by, his, military, career, advance, cromwell, s, conquest, left, no, significant, legacy, of, bitterness, in, scotland, the, rule, of, the, commonwealth, and, protectorate, was, largely, peaceful, apart, from, the, highlands, moreover, there, were, no, wholesale, confiscations, of, land, or, property, three, out, of, every, four, justices, of, the, peace, in, commonwealth, scotland, were, scots, and, the, country, was, governed, jointly, by, the, english, military, authorities, and, a, scottish, council, of, state, during, the, opening, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, in, 1776, the, connecticut, state, navy, commissioned, a, corvette, named, the, oliver, cromwell, as, one, of, the, first, american, naval, vessels, before, being, captured, in, battle, in, 1779, being, renamed, the, hms, restoration, before, being, commissioned, as, the, hms, loyalist, 19th, century, engineer, sir, richard, tangye, was, a, noted, cromwell, enthusiast, and, collector, of, cromwell, manuscripts, and, memorabilia, his, collection, included, many, rare, manuscripts, and, printed, books, medals, paintings, objets, d, art, and, a, bizarre, assemblage, of, relics, this, includes, cromwell, s, bible, button, coffin, plate, death, mask, and, funeral, escutcheon, on, tangye, s, death, the, entire, collection, was, donated, to, the, museum, of, london, where, it, can, still, be, seen, in, 1875, a, statue, of, cromwell, by, matthew, noble, was, erected, in, manchester, outside, the, manchester, cathedral, a, gift, to, the, city, by, abel, heywood, in, memory, of, her, first, husband, it, was, the, first, large, scale, statue, to, be, erected, in, the, open, in, england, and, was, a, realistic, likeness, based, on, the, painting, by, peter, lely, it, showed, cromwell, in, battledress, with, drawn, sword, and, leather, body, armour, it, was, unpopular, with, local, conservatives, and, the, large, irish, immigrant, population, queen, victoria, was, invited, to, open, the, new, manchester, town, hall, and, she, allegedly, consented, on, the, condition, that, the, statue, be, removed, the, statue, remained, victoria, declined, and, the, town, hall, was, opened, by, the, lord, mayor, during, the, 1980s, the, statue, was, relocated, outside, wythenshawe, hall, which, had, been, occupied, by, cromwell, s, troops, during, the, 1890s, parliamentary, plans, to, erect, a, statue, of, cromwell, outside, parliament, turned, controversial, pressure, from, the, irish, nationalist, party, forced, the, withdrawal, of, a, motion, to, seek, public, funding, for, the, project, the, statue, was, eventually, erected, but, it, had, to, be, funded, privately, by, lord, rosebery, cromwell, controversy, continued, into, the, 20th, century, winston, churchill, was, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, before, world, war, i, and, he, twice, suggested, naming, a, british, battleship, hms, oliver, cromwell, the, suggestion, was, vetoed, by, king, george, v, because, of, his, personal, feelings, and, because, he, felt, that, it, was, unwise, to, give, such, a, name, to, an, expensive, warship, at, a, time, of, irish, political, unrest, especially, given, the, anger, caused, by, the, statue, outside, parliament, churchill, was, eventually, told, by, first, sea, lord, admiral, battenberg, that, the, king, s, decision, must, be, treated, as, final, the, cromwell, tank, was, a, british, medium, weight, tank, first, used, in, 1944, and, a, steam, locomotive, built, by, british, railways, in, 1951, was, named, oliver, cromwell, other, public, statues, of, cromwell, are, the, statue, of, oliver, cromwell, st, ives, in, cambridgeshire, and, the, statue, of, oliver,

legislation, which, succeeded, it, the, following, year, is, the, nearest, thing, on, paper, in, the, english, and, more, broadly, british, domestic, record, to, a, programme, of, state, sanctioned, and, systematic, ethnic, cleansing, of, another, people, the, fact, that, it, did, not, include, total, genocide, in, its, remit, or, that, it, failed, to, put, into, practice, the, vast, majority, of, its, proposed, expulsions, ultimately, however, says, less, about, the, lethal, determination, of, its, makers, and, more, about, the, political, structural, and, financial, weakness, of, the, early, modern, english, state
