the, most, influential, critic, of, the, new, york, times, criticised, the, film, s, loose, structure, and, conceded, that, it, takes, patience, to, be, enjoyed, edward, harrison, an, american,

positive, review, describing, it, as, slow, rapt, and, hypnotic, while, making, aparajito, ray, had, not, planned, a, trilogy, but, after, he, was, asked, about, the, idea, in, venice, it, appealed, to, him, he, finished, the, last, of, the, trilogy, apur, sansar, the, world, of, apu, in, 1959, ray, introduced, two, of, his, favourite, actors, soumitra, chatterjee, and, sharmila, tagore, in, this, film, it, opens, with, apu, living, in, a, calcutta, house, in, near, poverty, he, becomes, involved, in, an, unusual, marriage, with, aparna, the, scenes, of, their, life, together, form, one, of, the, cinema, s, classic, affirmative, depictions, of, married, life, critics, robin, wood, and, aparna, sen, thought, it, was, a, major, achievement, to, mark, the, end, of, the, trilogy, after, apur, sansar, was, harshly, criticised, by, a, bengali, critic, ray, wrote, an, article, defending, it, he, rarely, responded, to, critics, during, his, filmmaking, career, but, also, later, defended, his, film, charulata, his, personal, favourite, american, critic, roger, ebert, summarised, the, trilogy, as, it, is, about, a, time, place, and, culture, far, removed, from, our, own, and, yet, it, connects, directly, and, deeply, with, our, human, feelings, it, is, like, a, prayer, affirming, that, this, is, what, the, cinema, can, be, no, matter, how, far, in, our, cynicism, we, may, stray, despite, ray, s, success, it, had, little, influence, on, his, personal, life, in, the, years, to, come, he, continued, to, live, with, his, wife, and, children, in, a, rented, house, on, lake, avenue, in, south, calcutta, with, his, mother, uncle, and, other, members, of, his, extended, family, the, home, is, currently, owned, by, iskcon, during, this, period, ray, made, films, about, the,

together, are, considered, by, critics, among, the, most, deeply, felt, portrayals, of, indian, women, on, screen, ray, followed, apur, sansar, with, 1960, s, devi, the, goddess, a, film, in, which, he, examined, the, superstitions, in, society, sharmila, tagore, starred, as, doyamoyee, a, young, wife, who, is, deified, by, her, father, in, law, ray, was, worried, that, the, central, board, of, film, certification, might, block, his, film, or, at, least, make, him, re, cut, it, but, devi, was, spared, upon, international, distribution, the, critic, from, chicago, reader, described, the, film, as, full, of, sensuality, and, ironic, undertones, in, 1961, on, the, insistence, of, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, ray, was, commissioned, to, make, rabindranath, tagore, based, on, the, poet, of, the, same, name, on, the, occasion, of, his, birth, centennial, a, tribute, to, the, person, who, likely, most, influenced, ray, due, to, limited, footage, of, tagore, ray, was, challenged, by, the, necessity, of, making, the, film, mainly, with, static, material, he, said, that, it, took, as, much, work, as, three, feature, films, in, the, same, year, together, with, subhas, mukhopadhyay, and, others, ray, was, able, to, revive, sandesh, the, children, s, magazine, which, his, grandfather, had, founded, ray, had, been, saving, money, for, some, years, to, make, this,

picturesque, hill, town, in, west, bengal, they, try, to, arrange, the, engagement, of, their, youngest, daughter, to, a, highly, paid, engineer, educated, in, london, ray, had, first, conceived, shooting, the, film, in, a, large, mansion, but, later, decided, to, film, it, in, the, famous, town, he, used, many, shades, of, light, and, mist, to, reflect, the, tension, in, the, drama, ray, noted, that, while, his, script, allowed, shooting, to, be, possible, under, any, lighting, conditions, a, commercial, film, crew, in, darjeeling, failed, to, shoot, a, single, scene, as, they, only, wanted, to, do, so, in, sunshine, the, new, york, times, bosley, crowther, gave, the, film, a, mixed, review, he, praised, ray, s, soft, and, relaxed, filmmaking, but, thought, the, characters, were,

painting, mainly, practised, by, bengali, women, at, the, time, of, religious, festivals, the, term, means, to, coat, with, thus, the, verisimilar, division, between, classical, and, folk, art, is, blurred, in, ray, s, representation, of, bengali, graphemes, the, three, tier, x, height, of, bengali, graphemes, was, presented, in, a, manner, of, musical, map, and, the, contours, curves, in, between, horizontal, and, vertical, meeting, point, follow, the, patterns, of, alpana, some, have, noted, ray, s, metamorphosis, of, graphemes, possibly, a, form, of, archewriting, as, a, living, object, subject, in, his, positive, manipulation, of, bengali, graphemes, as, a, graphic, designer, ray, designed, most, of, his, film, posters, combining, folk, art, and, calligraphy, to, create,

throughout, his, career, to, french, director, jean, renoir, who, influenced, him, greatly, he, also, acknowledged, italian, director, vittorio, de, sica, as, an, important, influence, whom, he, thought, represented, italian, neorealism, best, and, who, taught, him, how, to, cram, cinematic, details, into, a, single, shot, and, how, to, use, amateur, actors, and, actresses, ray, professed, to, have, learned, the, craft, of, cinema, from, old, hollywood, directors, such, as, john, ford, billy, wilder, and, ernst, lubitsch, he, had, deep, respect, and, admiration, for, his, contemporaries, akira, kurosawa, and, ingmar, bergman, whom, he, considered, giants, among, others, he, learned, the, use, of, freeze, frame, shots, from, fran, ois, truffaut, and, jump, cuts, fades, and, dissolves, from, jean, luc, godard, although, he, admired, godard, s, revolutionary, early, phase, he, thought, his, later, phase, was, alien, ray, adored, his, peer, michelangelo, antonioni, but, hated, blowup, which, he, considered, as, having, very, little, inner, movement, he, was, also, impressed, with, stanley, kubrick, s, work, although, ray, claimed, to, have, had, very, little, influence, from, sergei, eisenstein, films, such, as, pather, panchali, aparajito, charulata, and, sadgati, contain, scenes, which, show, striking, uses, of, montage, a, technique, eisenstein, helped, pioneer, ray, also, owned, sketches, of, eisenstein, ray, considered, script, writing, to, be, an, integral, part, of, direction, initially, he, refused, to, make, a, film, in, any, language, other, than, bengali, in, his, two, non, bengali, feature, films, he, wrote, the, script, in, english, translators, adapted, it, into, hindustani, under, ray, s, supervision, ray, s, eye, for, detail, was, matched, by, that, of, his, art, director, bansi, chandragupta, his, influence, on, the, early, films, was, so, important, that, ray, would, always, write, scripts, in, english, before, creating, a, bengali, version, so, that, the, non, bengali, chandragupta, would, be, able, to, read, it, subrata, mitra, s, cinematography, garnered, praise, in, ray, s, films, although, some, critics, thought, that, mitra, s, eventual, departure, from, ray, lowered, its, quality, mitra, stopped, working, for, him, after, nayak, 1966, mitra, developed, bounce, lighting, a, technique, to, reflect, light, from, cloth, to, create, a, diffused, realistic, light, even, on, a, set, ray, s, regular, film, editor, was, dulal, datta, but, the, director, usually, dictated, the, editing, while, datta, did, the, actual, work, due, to, finances, and, ray, s, meticulous, planning, his, films, apart, from, pather, panchali, were, mostly, cut, in, camera, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, ray, worked, with, indian, classical, musicians, including, ravi, shankar, vilayat, khan, and, ali, akbar, khan, he, found, that, their, first, loyalty, was, to, musical, traditions, and, not, to, his, film, he, obtained, a, greater, understanding, of, western, classical, forms, which, he, wanted, to, use, for, his, films, set, in, an, urban, milieu, starting, with, teen, kanya, ray, began, to, compose, his, own, scores, beethoven, was, ray, s, favourite, composer, ray, also, went, on, to, become, a, distinguished, connoisseur, of, western, classical, music, in, india, the, narrative, structure, of, ray, s, films, are, represented, by, musical, forms, such, as, sonata, fugue, and, rondo, kanchenjunga, nayak, and, aranyer, din, ratri, are, examples, of, this, structure, ray, cast, actors, from, diverse, backgrounds, from, well, known, stars, to, people, who, had, never, seen, a, film, as, in, aparajito, critics, such, as, robin, wood, have, lauded, him, as, the, best, director, of, children, recalling, memorable, performances, in, the, roles, of, apu, and, durga, pather, panchali, ratan, postmaster, and, mukul, sonar, kella, depending, on, the, actor, s, skill, and, experience, ray, varied, the, intensity, of, his, direction, from, virtually, nothing, with, actors, such, as, utpal, dutt, to, using, the, actor, as, a, puppet, e, g, with, subir, banerjee, as, young, apu, or, sharmila, tagore, as, aparna, actors, who, worked, for, ray, trusted, him, but, said, that, he, could, also, treat, incompetence, with, total, contempt, with, admiration, of, his, cinematic, style, and, craft, director, roger, manvell, said, in, the, restrained, style, he, has, adopted, ray, has, become, a, master, of, technique, he, takes, his, timing, from, the, nature, of, the, people, and, their, environment, his, camera, is, the, intent, unobtrusive, observer, of, reactions, his, editing, the, discreet, economical, transition, from, one, value, to, the, next, ray, credited, life, to, be, the, best, kind, of, inspiration, for, cinema, he, said, for, a, popular, medium, the, best, kind, of, inspiration, should, derive, from, life, and, have, its, roots, in, it, no, amount, of, technical, polish, can, make, up, for, artificiality, of, the, theme, and, the, dishonesty, of, treatment, ray, s, work, has, been, described, as, full, of, humanism, and, universality, and, of, a, deceptive, simplicity, with, deep, underlying, complexity, the, japanese, director, akira, kurosawa, said, not, to, have, seen, the, cinema, of, ray, means, existing, in, the, world, without, seeing, the, sun, or, the, moon, his, detractors, often, find, his, films, glacially, slow, moving, like, a, majestic, snail, some, critics, find, his, work, anti, modern, criticising, him, for, lacking, the, new, modes, of, expression, or, experimentation, found, in, works, of, ray, s, contemporaries, such, as, jean, luc, godard, as, stanley, kauffmann, wrote, some, critics, believe, that, ray, assumes, that, viewers, can, be, interested, in, a, film, that, simply, dwells, in, its, characters, rather, than, one, that, imposes, dramatic, patterns, on, their, lives, ray, said, he, could, do, nothing, about, the, slow, pace, kurosawa, defended, him, by, saying, that, ray, s, films, were, not, slow, rather, his, work, can, be, described, as, flowing, composedly, like, a, big, river, critics, have, often, compared, ray, to, anton, chekhov, jean, renoir, vittorio, de, sica, howard, hawks, and, mozart, the, writer, v, s, naipaul, compared, a, scene, in, shatranj, ki, khiladi, the, chess, players, to, a, shakespearean, play, writing, only, three, hundred, words, are, spoken, but, goodness, terrific, things, happen, even, critics, who, did, not, like, the, aesthetics, of, ray, s, films, generally, acknowledged, his, ability, to, encompass, a, whole, culture, with, all, its, nuances, ray, s, obituary, in, the, independent, included, the, question, who, else, can, compete, his, work, was, promoted, in, france, by, the, studio, des, ursuline, cinema, french, photographer, henri, cartier, bresson, described, ray, as, undoubtedly, a, giant, in, the, film, world, with, positive, admiration, for, most, of, ray, s, films, american, critic, roger, ebert, cited, the, apu, trilogy, among, the, greatest, films, american, critic, vincent, canby, once, wrote, about, ray, s, films, no, matter, what, the, particular, story, no, matter, what, the, social, political, circumstances, of, the, characters, the, cinema, of, satyajit, ray, the, apu, trilogy, the, music, room, distant, thunder, and, the, chess, players, among, others, is, so, exquisitely, realized, that, an, entire, world, is, evoked, from, comparatively, limited, details, praising, his, contribution, to, the, world, of, cinema, american, filmmaker, martin, scorsese, said, his, work, is, in, the, company, of, that, of, living, contemporaries, like, ingmar, bergman, akira, kurosawa, and, federico, fellini, american, filmmaker, francis, ford, coppola, cited, ray, as, a, major, influence, he, praised, 1960, s, devi, which, coppola, considers, as, ray, s, best, work, and, a, cinematic, milestone, coppola, admitted, to, learning, indian, cinema, through, ray, s, works, on, a, trip, to, india, filmmaker, christopher, nolan, expressed, his, admiration, for, ray, s, pather, panchali, saying, i, have, had, the, pleasure, of, watching, pather, panchali, recently, which, i, hadn, t, seen, before, i, think, it, is, one, of, the, best, films, ever, made, it, is, an, extraordinary, piece, of, work, politics, and, ego, have, also, influenced, debate, regarding, ray, s, work, certain, advocates, of, socialism, claim, that, ray, was, not, committed, to, the, cause, of, the, nation, s, downtrodden, classes, while, some, critics, accused, him, of, glorifying, poverty, in, pather, panchali, and, ashani, sanket, distant, thunder, through, lyricism, and, aesthetics, they, claim, he, provided, no, solution, to, conflicts, in, the, stories, and, was, unable, to, overcome, his, bourgeois, background, during, the, maoist, naxalite, movements, in, the, 1970s, agitators, once, came, close, to, causing, physical, harm, to, his, son, sandip, in, early, 1980, ray, was, criticised, by, indian, m, p, and, former, actress, nargis, dutt, who, accused, ray, of, exporting, poverty, she, wanted, him, to, make, films, that, represented, modern, india, in, a, highly, public, exchange, of, letters, during, the, 1960s, ray, harshly, criticised, the, film, akash, kusum, by, colleague, mrinal, sen, ray, said, that, sen, only, attacked, easy, targets, for, example, the, bengali, middle, classes, that, akash, kusum, bore, some, resemblance, to, parash, pathar, a, film, sen, had, admitted, to, not, liking, may, have, played, a, role, in, fracturing, their, previously, cordial, relationship, ray, would, continue, to, make, films, on, this, easy, target, demographic, including, pratidwandi, and, jana, aranya, set, during, the, naxalite, movement, in, bengal, and, the, two, filmmakers, would, continue, to, trade, praise, and, criticism, the, rest, of, their, careers, ray, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, film, directors, of, all, time, he, is, a, cultural, icon, in, india, and, in, bengali, communities, worldwide, following, his, death, the, city, of, calcutta, came, to, a, virtual,
