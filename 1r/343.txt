revolutionary, politics, of, the, time, she, was, roundly, attacked, by, the, state, and, by, former, supporters, and, friends, and, seen, to, be, an, anachronism, during, what, she, termed, the,

her, early, poems, usually, picture, a, man, and, a, woman, involved, in, the, most, poignant, ambiguous, moment, of, their, relationship, much, imitated, and, later, parodied, by, nabokov, and, others, critic, roberta, reeder, notes, that, the, early, poems, always, attracted, large, numbers, of, admirers, for, akhmatova, was, able, to, capture, and, convey, the, vast, range, of, evolving, emotions, experienced, in, a, love, affair, from, the, first, thrill, of, meeting, to, a, deepening, love, contending, with, hatred, and, eventually, to, violent, destructive, passion, or, total, indifference, but, her, poetry, marks, a, radical, break, with, the, erudite, ornate, style, and, the, mystical, representation, of, love, so, typical, of, poets, like, alexander, blok, and, andrey, bely, her, lyrics, are, composed, of, short, fragments, of, simple, speech, that, do, not, form, a, logical, coherent, pattern, instead, they, reflect, the, way, we, actually, think, the, links, between, the, images, are, emotional, and, simple, everyday, objects, are, charged, with, psychological, associations, like, alexander, pushkin, who, was, her, model, in, many, ways, akhmatova, was, intent, on, conveying, worlds, of, meaning, through, precise, details, akhmatova, often, complained, that, the, critics, walled, her, in, to, their, perception, of, her, work, in, the, early, years, of, romantic, passion, despite, major, changes, of, theme, in, the, later, years, of, the, terror, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, secret, nature, of, her, work, after, the, public, and, critical, effusion, over, her, first, volumes, the, risks, during, the, purges, were, very, great, many, of, her, close, friends, and, family, were, exiled, imprisoned, or, shot, her, son, was, under, constant, threat, of, arrest, she, was, often, under, close, surveillance, following, artistic, repression, and, public, condemnation, by, the, state, in, the, 1920s, many, within, literary, and, public, circles, at, home, and, abroad, thought, she, had, died, her, readership, generally, did, not, know, her, later, opus, the, railing, passion, of, requiem, or, poem, without, a, hero, and, her, other,

reworked, the, long, poem, requiem, in, secret, a, lyrical, cycle, of, lamentation, and, witness, depicting, the, suffering, of, the, common, people, under, soviet, terror, she, carried, it, with, her, as, she, worked, and, lived, in, towns, and, cities, across, the, soviet, union, it, was, conspicuously, absent, from, her, collected, works, given, its, explicit, condemnation, of, the, purges, the, work, in, russian, finally, appeared, in, book, form, in, munich, in, 1963, the, whole, work, not, published, within, ussr, until, 1987, it, consists, of, ten, numbered, poems, that, examine, a, series, of, emotional, states, exploring, suffering, despair, devotion, rather, than, a, clear, narrative, biblical, themes, such, as, christ, s, crucifixion, and, the, devastation, of, mary, mother, of, jesus, and, mary, magdalene, reflect, the, ravaging, of, russia, particularly, witnessing, the, harrowing, of, women, in, the, 1930s, it, represented, to, some, degree, a, rejection, of, her, own, earlier, romantic, work, as, she, took, on, the, public, role, as, chronicler, of, the, terror, this, is, a, role, she, holds, to, this, day, her, essays, on, pushkin, and, poem, without, a, hero, her, longest, work, were, only, published, after, her, death, this, long, poem, composed, between, 1940, and, 1965, is, often, critically, regarded, as, her, best, work, and, also, one, of, the, finest, poems, of, the, twentieth, century, it, gives, a, deep, and, detailed, analysis, of, her, epoch, and, her, approach, to, it, including, her, important, encounter, with, isaiah, berlin, 1909, 97, in, 1945, her, talent, in, composition, and, translation, is, evidenced, in, her, fine, translations, of, the, works, of, poets, writing, in, french, english, italian, armenian, and, korean
