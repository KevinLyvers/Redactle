make, perfume, though, he, was, rarely, out, of, debt, on, 1, january, 1684, defoe, married, mary, tuffley, at, st, botolph, s, aldgate, she, was, the, daughter, of, a, london, merchant, and, brought, with, her, a, dowry, of, 3, 700, a, huge, amount, by, the, standards, of, the, day, given, his, debts, and, political, difficulties, the, marriage, may, have, been, troubled, but, it, lasted, 47,

conflict, with, france, thus, damaging, prosperous, trade, relationships, for, defoe, in, 1692, he, was, arrested, for, debts, of, 700, and, in, the, face, of, total, debts, that, may, have, amounted, to, 17, 000, was, forced, to, declare, bankruptcy, he, died, with, little, wealth, and, evidently, embroiled, in, lawsuits, with, the, royal, treasury, following, his, release, from, debtors, prison, he, probably, travelled, in, europe, and, scotland, and, it, may, have, been, at, this, time, that, he, traded, wine, to, cadiz, porto, and, lisbon, by, 1695, he, was, back, in, england, now, formally, using, the, name, defoe, and, serving, as, a, commissioner, of, the, glass, duty, responsible, for, collecting, taxes, on, bottles, in, 1696, he, ran, a, tile, and, brick, factory, in, what, is, now, tilbury, in, essex, and, lived, in, the, parish, of, chadwell, st, mary, nearby, as, many, as, 545, titles, have, been, attributed, to, defoe, including, satirical, poems, political, and, religious, pamphlets, and, volumes, defoe, s, first, notable, publication, was, an, essay, upon, projects, a, series, of, proposals, for, social, and, economic, improvement, published, in, 1697, from, 1697, to, 1698, he, defended, the, right, of, king, william, iii, to, a, standing, army, during, disarmament, after, the, treaty, of, ryswick, 1697, had, ended, the, nine, years, war, 1688, 1697, his, most, successful, poem, the, true, born, englishman, 1701, defended, william, against, xenophobic, attacks, from, his, political, enemies, in, england, and, english, anti, immigration, sentiments, more, generally, in, 1701, defoe, presented, the, legion, s, memorial, to, robert, harley, then, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, and, his, subsequent, employer, while, flanked, by, a, guard, of, sixteen, gentlemen, of, quality, it, demanded, the, release, of, the, kentish, petitioners, who, had, asked, parliament, to, support, the, king, in, an, imminent, war, against, france, the, death, of, william, iii, in, 1702, once, again, created, a, political, upheaval, as, the, king, was, replaced, by, queen, anne, who, immediately, began, her, offensive, against, nonconformists, defoe, was, a, natural, target, and, his, pamphleteering, and, political, activities, resulted, in, his, arrest, and, placement, in, a, pillory, on, 31, july, 1703, principally, on, account, of, his, december, 1702, pamphlet, entitled, the, shortest, way, with, the, dissenters, or, proposals, for, the, establishment, of, the, church, purporting, to, argue, for, their, extermination, in, it, he, ruthlessly, satirised, both, the, high, church, tories, and, those, dissenters, who, hypocritically, practised, so, called, occasional, conformity, such, as, his, stoke, newington, neighbour, sir, thomas, abney, it, was, published, anonymously, but, the, true, authorship, was, quickly, discovered, and, defoe, was, arrested, he, was, charged, with, seditious, libel, and, found, guilty, in, a, trial, at, the, old, bailey, in, front, of, the, notoriously, sadistic, judge, salathiel, lovell, lovell, sentenced, him, to, a, punitive, fine, of, 200, marks, 336, then, 71, 883, in, 2024, to, public, humiliation, in, a, pillory, and, to, an, indeterminate, length, of, imprisonment, which, would, only, end, upon, the, discharge, of, the, punitive, fine, according, to, legend, the, publication, of, his, poem, hymn, to, the, pillory, caused, his, audience, at, the, pillory, to, throw, flowers, instead, of, the, customary, harmful, and, noxious, objects, and, to, drink, to, his, health, the, truth, of, this, story, is, questioned, by, most, scholars, although, john, robert, moore, later, said, that, no, man, in, england, but, defoe, ever, stood, in, the, pillory, and, later, rose, to, eminence, among, his, fellow, men, wherever, god, erects, a, house, of, prayer, the, devil, always, builds, a, chapel, there, and, t, will, be, found, upon, examination, the, latter, has, the, largest, congregation, defoe, s, the, true, born, englishman, 1701, after, his, three, days, in, the, pillory, defoe, went, into, newgate, prison, robert, harley, 1st, earl, of, oxford, and, earl, mortimer, brokered, his, release, in, exchange, for, defoe, s, cooperation, as, an, intelligence, agent, for, the, tories, in, exchange, for, such, cooperation, with, the, rival, political, side, harley, paid, some, of, defoe, s, outstanding, debts, improving, his, financial, situation, considerably, within, a, week, of, his, release, from, prison, defoe, witnessed, the, great, storm, of, 1703, which, raged, through, the, night, of, 26, 27, november, it, caused, severe, damage, to, london, and, bristol, uprooted, millions, of, trees, and, killed, more, than, 8, 000, people, mostly, at, sea, the, event, became, the, subject, of, defoe, s, the, storm, 1704, which, includes, a, collection, of, witness, accounts, of, the, tempest, many, regard, it, as, one, of, the, world, s, first, examples, of, modern, journalism, in, the, same, year, he, set, up, his, periodical, a, review, of, the, affairs, of, france, which, supported, the, harley, ministry, chronicling, the, events, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1702, 1714, the, review, ran, three, times, a, week, without, interruption, until, 1713, defoe, was, amazed, that, a, man, as, gifted, as, harley, left, vital, state, papers, lying, in, the, open, and, warned, that, he, was, almost, inviting, an, unscrupulous, clerk, to, commit, treason, his, warnings, were, fully, justified, by, the, william, gregg, affair, when, harley, was, ousted, from, the, ministry, in, 1708, defoe, continued, writing, the, review, to, support, godolphin, then, again, to, support, harley, and, the, tories, in, the, tory, ministry, of, 1710, 1714, the, tories, fell, from, power, with, the, death, of, queen, anne, but, defoe, continued, doing, intelligence, work, for, the, whig, government, writing, tory, pamphlets, that, undermined, the, tory, point, of, view, not, all, of, defoe, s, pamphlet, writing, was, political, one, pamphlet, was, originally, published, anonymously, entitled, a, true, relation, of, the, apparition, of, one, mrs, veal, the, next, day, after, her, death, to, one, mrs, bargrave, at, canterbury, the, 8th, of, september, 1705, it, deals, with, the, interaction, between, the, spiritual, realm, and, the, physical, realm, and, was, most, likely, written, in, support, of, charles, drelincourt, s, the, christian, defence, against, the, fears, of, death, 1651, it, describes, mrs, bargrave, s, encounter, with, her, old, friend, mrs, veal, after, she, had, died, it, is, clear, from, this, piece, and, other, writings, that, the, political, portion, of, defoe, s, life, was, by, no, means, his, only, focus, in, despair, during, his, imprisonment, for, the, seditious, libel, case, defoe, wrote, to, william, paterson, the, london, scot, and, founder, of, the, bank, of, england, and, part, instigator, of, the, darien, scheme, who, was, in, the, confidence, of, robert, harley, 1st, earl, of, oxford, and, earl, mortimer, leading, minister, and, spymaster, in, the, english, government, harley, accepted, defoe, s, services, and, released, him, in, 1703, he, immediately, published, the, review, which, appeared, weekly, then, three, times, a, week, written, mostly, by, himself, this, was, the, main, mouthpiece, of, the, english, government, promoting, the, act, of, union, 1707, defoe, began, his, campaign, in, the, review, and, other, pamphlets, aimed, at, english, opinion, claiming, that, it, would, end, the, threat, from, the, north, gaining, for, the, treasury, an, inexhaustible, treasury, of, men, a, valuable, new, market, increasing, the, power, of, england, by, september, 1706, harley, ordered, defoe, to, edinburgh, as, a, secret, agent, and, to, secure, acquiescence, by, using, underhand, methods, to, predispose, scots, opinion, in, favour, of, the, treaty, of, union, he, was, conscious, of, the, risk, to, himself, thanks, to, books, such, as, the, letters, of, daniel, defoe, edited, by, g, h, healey, oxford, 1955, far, more, is, known, about, his, activities, than, is, usual, with, such, agents, his, first, reports, included, vivid, descriptions, of, violent, demonstrations, against, the, union, a, scots, rabble, is, the, worst, of, its, kind, he, reported, defoe, reportedly, became, fearful, of, being, lynched, after, a, threatening, crowd, surged, up, the, high, street, shouting, no, union, no, english, dogs, years, later, john, clerk, of, penicuik, a, leading, unionist, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, it, was, not, known, at, the, time, that, defoe, had, been, sent, by, godolphin, to, give, a, faithful, account, to, him, from, time, to, time, how, everything, past, here, he, was, therefor, a, spy, among, us, but, not, known, to, be, such, otherways, the, mob, of, edin, had, pull, him, to, pieces, defoe, was, a, presbyterian, who, had, suffered, in, england, for, his, convictions, and, as, such, he, was, accepted, as, an, adviser, to, the, general, assembly, of, the, church, of, scotland, and, committees, of, the, parliament, of, scotland, he, told, harley, that, he, was, privy, to, all, their, folly, but, perfectly, unsuspected, as, with, corresponding, with, anybody, in, england, he, was, then, able, to, influence, the, proposals, that, were, put, to, parliament, and, reported, having, had, the, honour, to, be, always, sent, for, the, committee, to, whom, these, amendments, were, referr, d, i, have, had, the, good, fortune, to, break, their, measures, in, two, particulars, via, the, bounty, on, corn, and, proportion, of, the, excise, for, scotland, he, used, different, arguments, even, the, opposite, of, those, which, he, used, in, england, usually, ignoring, the, english, doctrine, of, the, sovereignty, of, parliament, for, example, telling, the, scots, that, they, could, have, complete, confidence, in, the, guarantees, in, the, treaty, some, of, his, pamphlets, were, purported, to, be, written, by, scots, misleading, even, reputable, historians, into, quoting, them, as, evidence, of, scottish, opinion, of, the, time, the, same, is, true, of, a, massive, history, of, the, union, which, defoe, published, in, 1709, and, which, some, historians, still, treat, as, a, valuable, contemporary, source, for, their, own, works, defoe, took, pains, to, give, his, history, an, air, of, objectivity, by, giving, some, space, to, arguments, against, the, union, but, always, kept, the, last, word, for, himself, he, disposed, of, the, main, union, opponent, andrew, fletcher, of, saltoun, by, ignoring, him, nor, does, he, account, for, the, deviousness, of, the, duke, of, hamilton, the, official, leader, of, the, various, factions, opposed, to, the, union, who, seemingly, betrayed, his, former, colleagues, when, he, switched, to, the, unionist, government, side, in, the, decisive, final, stages, of, the, debate, in, 1709, defoe, authored, a, lengthy, book, entitled, the, history, of, the, union, of, great, britain, an, edinburgh, publication, printed, by, the, heirs, of, anderson, defoe, is, cited, twice, in, the, book, as, its, author, and, gives, details, of, the, events, leading, up, to, the, acts, of, union, 1707, dating, as, far, back, as, 6, december, 1604, when, king, james, i, was, presented, with, a, proposal, for, unification, this, so, called, first, draft, for, unification, took, place, just, a, little, over, 100, years, before, the, signing, of, the, 1707, accord, defoe, made, no, attempt, to, explain, why, the, same, parliament, of, scotland, which, was, so, vehemently, in, favour, of, remaining, independent, from, 1703, to, 1705, became, so, supine, in, 1706, he, received, very, little, reward, from, his, paymasters, and, no, recognition, for, his, services, by, the, government, he, made, use, of, his, scottish, experience, to, write, his, tour, thro, the, whole, island, of, great, britain, published, in, 1726, where, he, admitted, that, the, increase, of, trade, and, population, in, scotland, which, he, had, predicted, as, a, consequence, of, the, union, was, not, the, case, but, rather, the, contrary, defoe, s, description, of, glasgow, glaschu, as, a, dear, green, place, has, often, been, misquoted, as, a, gaelic, translation, for, the, town, s, name, the, gaelic, glas, could, mean, grey, or, green, while, chu, means, dog, or, hollow, glaschu, probably, means, green, hollow, the, dear, green, place, like, much, of, scotland, was, a, hotbed, of, unrest, against, the, union, the, local, tron, minister, urged, his, congregation, to, up, and, anent, for, the, city, of, god, the, dear, green, place, and, city, of, god, required, government, troops, to, put, down, the, rioters, tearing, up, copies, of, the, treaty, at, almost, every, mercat, cross, in, scotland, when, defoe, visited, in, the, mid, 1720s, he, claimed, that, the, hostility, towards, his, party, was, because, they, were, english, and, because, of, the, union, which, they, were, almost, universally, exclaimed, against, the, extent, and, particulars, are, widely, contested, concerning, defoe, s, writing, in, the, period, from, the, tory, fall, in, 1714, to, the, publication, of, robinson, crusoe, in, 1719, defoe, comments, on, the, tendency, to, attribute, tracts, of, uncertain, authorship, to, him, in, his, apologia, appeal, to, honour, and, justice, 1715, a, defence, of, his, part, in, harley, s, tory, ministry, 1710, 1714, other, works, that, anticipate, his, novelistic, career, include, the, family, instructor, 1715, a, conduct, manual, on, religious, duty, minutes, of, the, negotiations, of, monsr, mesnager, 1717, in, which, he, impersonates, nicolas, mesnager, the, french, plenipotentiary, who, negotiated, the, treaty, of, utrecht, 1713, and, a, continuation, of, the, letters, writ, by, a, turkish, spy, 1718, a, satire, of, european, politics, and, religion, ostensibly, written, by, a, muslim, in, paris, from, 1719, to, 1724, defoe, published, the, novels, for, which, he, is, famous, see, below, in, the, final, decade, of, his, life, he, also, wrote, conduct, manuals, including, religious, courtship, 1722, the, complete, english, tradesman, 1726, and, the, new, family, instructor, 1727, he, published, a, number, of, books, decrying, the, breakdown, of, the, social, order, such, as, the, great, law, of, subordination, considered, 1724, and, everybody, s, business, is, nobody, s, business, 1725, and, works, on, the, supernatural, like, the, political, history, of, the, devil, 1726, a, system, of, magick, 1727, and, an, essay, on, the, history, and, reality, of, apparitions, 1727, his, works, on, foreign, travel, and, trade, include, a, general, history, of, discoveries, and, improvements, 1727, and, atlas, maritimus, and, commercialis, 1728, perhaps, his, most, significant, work, apart, from, the, novels, is, a, tour, thro, the, whole, island, of, great, britain, 1724, 1727, which, provided, a, panoramic, survey, of, british, trade, on, the, eve, of, the, industrial, revolution, published, in, 1726, the, complete, english, tradesman, is, an, example, of, defoe, s, political, works, in, the, work, defoe, discussed, the, role, of, the, tradesman, in, england, in, comparison, to, tradesmen, internationally, arguing, that, the, british, system, of, trade, is, far, superior, defoe, also, implied, that, trade, was, the, backbone, of, the, british, economy, estate, s, a, pond, but, trade, s, a, spring, in, the, work, defoe, praised, the, practicality, of, trade, not, only, within, the, economy, but, the, social, stratification, as, well, defoe, argued, that, most, of, the, british, gentry, was, at, one, time, or, another, inextricably, linked, with, the, institution, of, trade, either, through, personal, experience, marriage, or, genealogy, oftentimes, younger, members, of, noble, families, entered, into, trade, and, marriages, to, a, tradesman, s, daughter, by, a, nobleman, was, also, common, overall, defoe, demonstrated, a, high, respect, for, tradesmen, being, one, himself, not, only, did, defoe, elevate, individual, british, tradesmen, to, the, level, of, gentleman, but, he, praised, the, entirety, of, british, trade, as, a, superior, system, to, other, systems, of, trade, trade, defoe, argues, is, a, much, better, catalyst, for, social, and, economic, change, than, war, defoe, also, argued, that, through, the, expansion, of, the, british, empire, and, british, mercantile, influence, britain, would, be, able, to, increase, commerce, at, home, through, job, creations, and, increased, consumption, he, wrote, in, the, work, that, increased, consumption, by, laws, of, supply, and, demand, increases, production, and, in, turn, raises, wages, for, the, poor, therefore, lifting, part, of, british, society, further, out, of, poverty, published, when, defoe, was, in, his, late, fifties, robinson, crusoe, relates, the, story, of, a, man, s, shipwreck, on, a, desert, island, for, twenty, eight, years, and, his, subsequent, adventures, throughout, its, episodic, narrative, crusoe, s, struggles, with, faith, are, apparent, as, he, bargains, with, god, in, times, of, life, threatening, crises, but, time, and, again, he, turns, his, back, after, his, deliverances, he, is, finally, content, with, his, lot, in, life, separated, from, society, following, a, more, genuine, conversion, experience, in, the, opening, pages, of, the, farther, adventures, of, robinson, crusoe, the, author, describes, how, crusoe, settled, in, bedfordshire, married, and, produced, a, family, and, that, when, his, wife, died, he, went, off, on, these, further, adventures, bedford, is, also, the, place, where, the, brother, of, h, f, in, a, journal, of, the, plague, year, retired, to, avoid, the, danger, of, the, plague, so, that, by, implication, if, these, works, were, not, fiction, defoe, s, family, met, crusoe, in, bedford, from, whence, the, information, in, these, books, was, gathered, defoe, went, to, school, in, newington, green, with, a, friend, named, caruso, the, novel, has, been, assumed, to, be, based, in, part, on, the, story, of, the, scottish, castaway, alexander, selkirk, who, spent, four, years, stranded, in, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, but, his, experience, is, inconsistent, with, the, details, of, the, narrative, the, island, selkirk, lived, on, m, s, a, tierra, closer, to, land, was, renamed, robinson, crusoe, island, in, 1966, it, has, also, been, supposed, that, defoe, may, have, also, been, inspired, by, a, translation, of, a, book, by, the, andalusian, arab, muslim, polymath, ibn, tufail, who, was, known, as, abubacer, in, europe, the, latin, edition, was, entitled, philosophus, autodidactus, simon, ockley, published, an, english, translation, in, 1708, entitled, the, improvement, of, human, reason, exhibited, in, the, life, of, hai, ebn, yokdhan, defoe, s, next, novel, was, captain, singleton, 1720, an, adventure, story, whose, first, half, covers, a, traversal, of, africa, which, anticipated, subsequent, discoveries, by, david, livingstone, and, whose, second, half, taps, into, the, contemporary, fascination, with, piracy, the, novel, has, been, commended, for, its, sensitive, depiction, of, the, close, relationship, between, the, hero, and, his, religious, mentor, quaker, william, walters, its, description, of, the, geography, of, africa, and, some, of, its, fauna, does, not, use, the, language, or, knowledge, of, a, fiction, writer, and, suggests, an, eyewitness, experience, memoirs, of, a, cavalier, 1720, is, set, during, the, thirty, years,
