and, writing, poems, in, which, he, often, reflected, on, the, pleasures, and, difficulties, of, life, as, well, as, his, decision, to, withdraw, from, civil, service, tao, s, simple, and, direct, style, was, somewhat, at, odds, with, the, norms, for, literary, writing, in, his, time, in, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, he, was, well, known, as, a, recluse, during, the, northern, song, dynasty, 960, 1127, influential, literati, figures, such, as, su, shi, 1037, 1101, declared, him, a, paragon, of, authenticity, and, spontaneity, in, poetry, predicting, that, tao, yuanming, would, achieve, lasting, literary, fame, however, tao, yuanming, s, inclusion, in, the, 6th, century, literary, anthology, wen, xuan, argues, for, at, least, a, beginning, of, fame, in, his, own, era, at, least, in, his, own, birth, area, tao, yuanming, would, later, be, regarded, as, the, foremost, representative, of, what, we, now, know, as, fields, and, gardens, poetry, tao, yuanming, found, inspiration, in, the, beauty, and, serenity, of, the, natural, world, close, at, hand, tao, yuanming, is, depicted, in, the, wu, shuang, pu, table, of, peerless, heroes, by, jin, guliang, in, the, middle, of, his, life, tao, changed, his, name, keeping, his, family, name, from, tao, yuanming, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, t, o, yu, nm, ng, wade, giles, t, ao, y, an, ming, to, tao, qian, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, t, o, qi, n, wade, giles, t, ao, ch, ien, master, of, the, five, willows, another, name, which, he, used, when, quite, young, seems, to, be, a, sobriquet, of, his, own, invention, there, is, a, surviving, autobiographical, essay, from, his, youth, in, which, tao, yuanming, uses, five, willows, to, allude, to, himself, after, this, tao, refers, to, himself, in, his, earlier, writings, as, yuanming, however, it, is, thought, that, with, the, demise, of, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, in, 420, that, he, began, to, refer, to, himself, as, qian, meaning, hiding, as, a, signification, of, his, final, withdrawal, into, the, quiet, life, in, the, country, and, his, decision, to, avoid, any, further, participation, in, the, political,

yuanming, government, servant, the, names, yuanliang, shenming, and, quanming, are, all, associated, with, tao, yuanming, some, of, this, confusion, results, from, a, naming, taboo, during, the, tang, dynasty, specifically, that, the, characters, for, an, emperor, s, name, were, impermissible, to, use, either, to, write, or, even, to, casually, pronounce, this, taboo, required, the, substitution, of, similar, characters, or, words, in, order, to, avoid, this, prohibition, as, the, high, founder, of, the, tang, dynasty, posthumously, titled, emperor, gaozu, of, tang, had, the, personal, name, li, yuan, the, yuan, character, became, taboo, so, since, this, was, the, same, as, the, yuan, in, yuanming, various, authors, substituted, the, synonymous, shen, for, yuan, both, referring, to, depths, tao, yuanming, s, great, grandfather, was, the, eminent, jin, dynasty, general, and, governor, tao, kan, 259, 334, his, grandfather, and, father, also, both, served, as, government, officials, rising, to, the, level, of, county, governor, however, the, family, circumstances, into, which, tao, yuanming, was, born, were, only, those, of, moderate, poverty, and, lack, of, much, political, influence, family, circumstances, included, the, death, of, his, father, when, he, was, eight, years, old, tao, yuanming, is, considered, to, be, a, person, of, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, 316, 317, 419, 420, ce, although, living, beyond, the, demise, of, that, dynasty, the, last, stable, period, in, chinese, history, had, been, during, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, which, was, followed, by, the, various, political, permutations, known, as, the, three, kingdoms, one, of, these, successor, states, being, cao, wei, founded, and, ruled, by, the, cao, clan, and, basically, briefly, reunifying, china, the, jin, dynasty, was, founded, and, controlled, by, the, sima, clan, the, leading, members, of, which, were, known, for, gaining, and, retaining, power, through, corruption, this, began, before, the, birth, of, tao, yuanming, when, sima, yan, usurped, the, throne, of, the, monarchal, ruler, of, cao, wei, dynasty, establishing, its, headquarters, at, the, western, capital, of, chang, an, and, renaming, the, kingdom, jin, subsequently, the, history, of, the, dynasty, was, characterized, by, nepotism, corrupt, politics, civil, disorder, and, violence, various, other, clans, also, vied, for, power, the, sima, fought, against, these, as, well, as, each, other, the, weaknesses, inherent, in, the, system, culminated, in, the, war, of, the, eight, princes, 291, to, 306, all, eight, princes, being, simas, immediate, subsequent, events, resulted, in, certain, rebels, and, bandits, overruning, the, country, many, of, these, prominent, rebels, were, not, ethnic, han, chinese,

successors, of, various, clans, and, also, subject, to, less, successful, rebellions, by, various, warlords, and, also, facing, external, threats, from, other, states, such, as, northern, wei, whose, dynastic, rulers, were, of, the, tuoba, tabgach, clan, of, the, xianbei, eventually, the, whole, jin, state, was, replaced, by, liu, song, in, 419, 420, this, new, dynasty, was, named, song, like, the, much, later, larger, dynasty, and, was, ruled, by, the, liu, family, and, was, also, corrupt, and, short, lived, versions, of, tao, yuanming, s, biography, in, the, chinese, source, material,

nature, s, features, located, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, chaisang, detailed, information, on, tao, yuanming, s, younger, years, are, not, known, although, it, is, safe, to, say, that, they, were, lived, in, a, difficult, environment, when, he, would, have, been, eighteen, or, nineteen, both, the, invasion, by, the, state, of, former, qin, ruled, by, an, ethnically, hu, dynasty, and, the, events, culminating, in, the, battle, of, fei, river, 383, occurred, after, great, risk, to, the, existence, of, eastern, jin, this, against, the, odds, resulted, in, gains, of, territory, north, of, yangzi, river, while, also, whetting, eastern, jin, appetites, for, reconquering, the, former, northern, territories, many, events, would, occur, during, tao, yuanming, s, lifetime, including, two,

of, 63, if, however, he, was, in, fact, born, in, 352, he, would, instead, have, been, 76, years, old, when, he, died, there, are, various, sources, with, information, about, tao, yuanming, as, he,
