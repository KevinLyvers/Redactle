fit, of, temper, referred, to, him, as, a, lame, brat, however, byron, s, biographer, doris, langley, moore, in, her, 1974, book, accounts, rendered, paints, a, more, sympathetic, view, of, mrs,

19th, century, biographer, john, galt, s, claim, that, she, over, indulged, in, alcohol, byron, s, mother, in, law, judith, noel, the, hon, lady, milbanke, died, in, 1822, and, her, will, required, that, he, change, his, surname, to, noel, in, order, to, inherit, half, of, her, estate, he, accordingly, obtained, a, royal, warrant, enabling, him, to, take, and, use, the, surname, of, noel, only, and, to, subscribe, the, said, surname, of, noel, before, all, titles, of, honour, from, that, point, he, signed, himself, noel, byron, the, usual, signature, of, a, peer, being, merely, the, name, of, the, peerage, in, this, case, simply, byron, some, have, speculated, that, he, did, this, so, that, his, initials, would, read, n, b, mimicking, those, of, his, hero, napoleon, bonaparte, lady, byron, eventually, succeeded, to, the, barony, of, wentworth, becoming, lady, wentworth, byron, received, his, early, formal, education, at, aberdeen, grammar, school, in, 1798, until, his, move,

exercise, in, moderation, but, could, not, restrain, himself, from, violent, bouts, of, activity, in, an, attempt, to, compensate, for, his, deformed, foot, his, mother, interfered, with, his, studies, often, withdrawing, him, from, school, which, arguably, contributed, to, his, lack, of, self, discipline, and, his, neglect, of, his, classical, studies, byron, was, sent, to, harrow, school, in, 1801, and, remained, there, until, july, 1805, an, undistinguished, student, and, an, unskilled, cricketer, he, nevertheless, represented, the, school, during, the, first, eton, v, harrow, cricket, match, at, lord, s, in, 1805, his, lack, of, moderation, was, not, restricted, to, physical, exercise, byron, fell, in, love, with, mary, chaworth, whom, he, met, while, at, school, and, she, was, the, reason, he, refused, to, return, to, harrow, in, september, 1803, his, mother, wrote, he, has, no, indisposition, that, i, know, of, but, love, desperate, love, the, worst, of, all, maladies, in, my, opinion, in, short, the, boy, is, distractedly, in, love, with, miss, chaworth, in, byron, s, later, memoirs, mary, chaworth, is, portrayed, as, the, first, object, of, his, adult, sexual, feelings, byron, finally, returned, in, january, 1804, to, a, more, settled, period, which, saw, the, formation, of, a, circle, of, emotional, involvements, with, other, harrow, boys, which, he, recalled, with, great, vividness, my, school, friendships, were, with, me, passions, for, i, was, always, violent, the, most, enduring, of, those, was, with, john, fitzgibbon, 2nd, earl, of, clare, four, years, byron, s, junior, whom, he, was, to, meet, again, unexpectedly, many, years, later, in, 1821, in, italy, his, nostalgic, poems, about, his, harrow, friendships, childish, recollections, 1806, express, a, prescient, consciousness, of, sexual, differences, that, may, in, the, end, make, england, untenable, to, him, letters, to, byron, in, the, john, murray, archive, contain, evidence, of, a, previously, unremarked, if, short, lived, romantic, relationship, with, a, younger, boy, at, harrow, john, thomas, claridge, in, the, following, autumn, he, entered, trinity, college, cambridge, where, he, met, and, formed, a, close, friendship, with, the, younger, john, edleston, about, his, prot, g, he, wrote, he, has, been, my, almost, constant, associate, since, october, 1805, when, i, entered, trinity, college, his, voice, first, attracted, my, attention, his, countenance, fixed, it, and, his, manners, attached, me, to, him, for, ever, after, edleston, s, death, byron, composed, thyrza, a, series, of, elegies, in, his, memory, in, later, years, he, described, the, affair, as, a, violent, though, pure, love, and, passion, this, statement, however, needs, to, be, read, in, the, context, of, hardening, public, attitudes, toward, homosexuality, in, england, and, the, severe, sanctions, including, public, hanging, imposed, upon, convicted, or, even, suspected, offenders, the, liaison, on, the, other, hand, may, well, have, been, pure, out, of, respect, for, edleston, s, innocence, in, contrast, to, the, probably, more, sexually, overt, relations, experienced, at, harrow, school, the, poem, the, cornelian, was, written, about, the, cornelian, that, byron, had, received, from, edleston, byron, spent, three, years, at, trinity, college, engaging, in, boxing, horse, riding, gambling, and, sexual, escapades, while, at, cambridge, he, also, formed, lifelong, friendships, with, men, such, as, john, cam, hobhouse, who, initiated, him, into, the, cambridge, whig, club, which, endorsed, liberal, politics, and, francis, hodgson, a, fellow, at, king, s, college, with, whom, he, corresponded, on, literary, and, other, matters, until, the, end, of, his, life, while, not, at, school, or, college, byron, lived, at, his, mother, s, residence, burgage, manor, in, southwell, nottinghamshire, while, there, he, cultivated, friendships, with, elizabeth, bridget, pigot, and, her, brother, john, with, whom, he, staged, two, plays, for, the, entertainment, of, the, community, during, this, time, with, the, help, of, elizabeth, pigot, who, copied, many, of, his, rough, drafts, he, was, encouraged, to, write, his, first, volumes, of, poetry, fugitive, pieces, was, printed, by, ridge, of, newark, which, contained, poems, written, when, byron, was, only, 17, however, it, was, promptly, recalled, and, burned, on, the, advice, of, his, friend, the, reverend, j, t, becher, on, account, of, its, more, amorous, verses, particularly, the, poem, to, mary, hours, of, idleness, a, collection, of, many, of, the, previous, poems, along, with, more, recent, compositions, was, the, culminating, book, the, savage, anonymous, criticism, it, received, now, known, to, be, the, work, of, henry, peter, brougham, in, the, edinburgh, review, prompted, byron, to, compose, his, first, major, satire, english, bards, and, scotch, reviewers, 1809, byron, put, it, into, the, hands, of, his, relative, r, c, dallas, and, asked, him, to, get, it, published, without, his, name, alexander, dallas, suggested, a, large, number, of, changes, to, the, manuscript, and, provided, the, reasoning, for, some, of, them, dallas, also, stated, that, byron, had, originally, intended, to, prefix, an, argument, to, this, poem, which, dallas, quoted, although, it, was, published, anonymously, that, april, r, c, dallas, wrote, that, you, are, already, pretty, generally, known, to, be, the, author, the, work, so, upset, some, of, his, critics, that, they, challenged, byron, to, a, duel, over, time, in, subsequent, editions, it, became, a, mark, of, prestige, to, be, the, target, of, byron, s, pen, after, his, return, from, travels, he, entrusted, r, c, dallas, as, his, literary, agent, with, the, publication, of, his, poem, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, which, byron, thought, to, be, of, little, account, the, first, two, cantos, of, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, were, published, in, 1812, and, were, received, with, critical, acclaim, in, byron, s, own, words, i, awoke, one, morning, and, found, myself, famous, he, followed, up, this, success, with, the, poem, s, last, two, cantos, as, well, as, four, equally, celebrated, oriental, tales, the, giaour, the, bride, of, abydos, the, corsair, and, lara, about, the, same, time, he, began, his, intimacy, with, his, future, biographer, thomas, moore, byron, racked, up, numerous, debts, as, a, young, man, owing, to, what, his, mother, termed, a, reckless,

instead, turned, to, the, mediterranean, his, journey, enabled, him, to, avoid, his, creditors, and, to, meet, up, with, a, former, love, mary, chaworth, the, subject, of, his, poem, to, a, lady, on, being, asked, my, reason, for, quitting, england, in, the, spring, another, reason, for, choosing, to, visit, the, mediterranean, was, probably, his, curiosity, about, the, levant, he, had, read, about, the, ottoman, and, persian, lands, as, a, child, was, attracted, to, islam, especially, sufi, mysticism, and, later, wrote, with, these, countries, and, events, connected, with, them, all, my,

thomas, moore, to, whom, he, confided, his, autobiography, or, life, and, adventures, which, moore, hobhouse, and, byron, s, publisher, john, murray, burned, in, 1824, a, month, after, byron, s, death, of, byron, s, lifestyle, in, ravenna, we, know, more, from, shelley, who, documented, some, of, its, more, colourful, aspects, in, a, letter, lord, byron, gets, up, at, two, i, get, up, quite, contrary, to, my, usual, custom, at, 12, after, breakfast, we, sit, talking, till, six, from, six, to, eight, we, gallop, through, the, pine, forest, which, divide, ravenna, from, the, sea, we, then, come, home, and, dine, and, sit, up, gossiping, till, six, in, the, morning, i, don, t, suppose, this, will, kill, me, in, a, week, or, fortnight, but, i, shall, not, try, it, longer, lord, b, s, establishment, consists, besides, servants, of, ten, horses, eight, enormous, dogs, three, monkeys, five, cats, an, eagle, a, crow, and, a, falcon, and, all, these, except, the, horses, walk, about, the, house, which, every, now, and, then, resounds, with, their, unarbitrated, quarrels, as, if, they, were, the, masters, of, it, i, find, that, my, enumeration, of, the, animals, in, this, circean, palace, was, defective, i, have, just, met, on, the, grand, staircase, five, peacocks, two, guinea, hens, and, an, egyptian, crane, i, wonder, who, all, these, animals, were, before, they, were, changed, into, these, shapes, in, 1821, byron, left, ravenna, and, went, to, live, in, the, tuscan, city, of, pisa, to, which, teresa, had, also, relocated, from, 1821, to, 1822, byron, finished, cantos, 6, 12, of, don, juan, at, pisa, and, in, the, same, year, he, joined, with, leigh, hunt, and, shelley, in, starting, a, short, lived, newspaper, the, liberal, in, whose, first, number, the, vision, of, judgment, appeared, for, the, first, time, since, his, arrival, in, italy, byron, found, himself, tempted, to, give, dinner, parties, his, guests, included, the, shelleys, edward, ellerker, williams, thomas, medwin, john, taaffe, and, edward, john, trelawny, and, never, as, shelley, said, did, he, display, himself, to, more, advantage, than, on, these, occasions, being, at, once, polite, and, cordial, full, of, social, hilarity, and, the, most, perfect, good, humour, never, diverging, into, ungraceful, merriment, and, yet, keeping, up, the, spirit, of, liveliness, throughout, the, evening, shelley, and, williams, rented, a, house, on, the, coast, and, had, a, schooner, built, byron, decided, to, have, his, own, yacht, and, engaged, trelawny, s, friend, captain, daniel, roberts, to, design, and, construct, the, boat, named, the, bolivar, it, was, later, sold, to, charles, john, gardiner, 1st, earl, of, blessington, and, marguerite, countess, of, blessington, when, byron, left, for, greece, in, 1823, byron, attended, the, beachside, cremation, of, shelley, which, was, orchestrated, by, trelawny, after, williams, and, shelley, drowned, in, a, boating, accident, on, 8, july, 1822, his, last, italian, home, was, in, genoa, while, living, there, he, was, accompanied, by, the, countess, guiccioli, and, the, blessingtons, lady, blessington, based, much, of, the, material, in, her, book, conversations, with, lord, byron, on, the, time, spent, together, there, this, book, became, an, important, biographical, text, about, byron, s, life, just, prior, to, his, death, byron, was, living, in, genoa, in, 1823, when, growing, bored, with, his, life, there, he, accepted, overtures, for, his, support, from, representatives, of, the, greek, independence, movement, from, the, ottoman, empire, at, first, byron, did, not, wish, to, leave, his, 22, year, old, mistress, countess, teresa, guiccioli, who, had, abandoned, her, husband, to, live, with, him, but, ultimately, guiccioli, s, father, count, gamba, was, allowed, to, leave, his, exile, in, the, romagna, under, the, condition, that, his, daughter, return, to, him, without, byron, at, the, same, time, that, the, philhellene, edward, blaquiere, was, attempting, to, recruit, him, byron, was, confused, as, to, what, he, was, supposed, to, do, in, greece, writing, blaquiere, seemed, to, think, that, i, might, be, of, some, use, even, here, though, what, he, did, not, exactly, specify, with, the, assistance, of, his, banker, and, captain, daniel, roberts, byron, chartered, the, brig, hercules, to, take, him, to, greece, when, byron, left, genoa, it, caused, passionate, grief, from, guiccioli, who, wept, openly, as, he, sailed, away, the, hercules, was, forced, to, return, to, port, shortly, afterwards, when, it, set, sail, for, the, final, time, guiccioli, had, already, left, genoa, on, 16, july, byron, left, genoa, arriving, at, kefalonia, in, the, ionian, islands, on, 4, august, his, voyage, is, covered, in, detail, in, donald, prell, s, sailing, with, byron, from, genoa, to, cephalonia, prell, also, wrote, of, a, coincidence, in, byron, s, chartering, the, hercules, the, vessel, was, launched, only, a, few, miles, south, of, seaham, hall, where, in, 1815, byron, had, married, annabella, milbanke, between, 1815, and, 1823, the, vessel, was, in, service, between, england, and, canada, suddenly, in, 1823, the, ship, s, captain, decided, to, sail, to, genoa, and, offer, the, hercules, for, charter, after, taking, byron, to, greece, the, ship, returned, to, england, never, again, to, venture, into, the, mediterranean, the, hercules, was, aged, 37, when, on, 21, september, 1852, she, went, aground, near, hartlepool, 25, miles, south, of, sunderland, the, place, where, her, keel, had, been, laid, in, 1815, byron, s, keel, was, laid, nine, months, before, his, official, birth, date, 22, january, 1788, therefore, in, ship, years, he, was, also, 37, when, he, died, in, missolonghi, byron, initially, stayed, on, the, island, of, kefalonia, where, he, was, besieged, by, agents, of, the, rival, greek, factions, all, of, whom, wanted, to, recruit, byron, for, their, own, cause, the, ionian, islands, of, which, kefalonia, is, one, were, under, british, rule, until, 1864, byron, spent, 4, 000, of, his, own, money, to, refit, the, greek, fleet, when, byron, travelled, to, the, mainland, of, greece, on, the, night, of, 28, december, 1823, byron, s, ship, was, surprised, by, an, ottoman, warship, which, did, not, attack, his, ship, as, the, ottoman, captain, mistook, byron, s, boat, for, a, fireship, to, avoid, the, ottoman, navy, which, he, encountered, several, times, on, his, voyage, byron, was, forced, to, take, a, roundabout, route, and, only, reached, missolonghi, on, 5, january, 1824, after, arriving, in, missolonghi, byron, joined, forces, with, alexandros, mavrokordatos, a, greek, politician, with, military, power, byron, moved, to, the, second, floor, of, a, two, story, house, and, was, forced, to, spend, much, of, his, time, dealing, with, unruly, souliotes, who, demanded, that, byron, pay, them, the, back, pay, owed, to, them, by, the, greek, government, byron, gave, the, souliotes, some, 6, 000, byron, was, supposed, to, lead, an, attack, on, the, ottoman, fortress, of, navpaktos, whose, albanian, garrison, were, unhappy, due, to, arrears, in, pay, and, who, offered, to, put, up, only, token, resistance, if, byron, was, willing, to, bribe, them, into, surrendering, however, ottoman, commander, yussuf, pasha, executed, the, mutinous, albanian, officers, who, were, offering, to, surrender, navpaktos, to, byron, and, arranged, to, have, some, of, the, arrears, paid, out, to, the, rest, of, the, garrison, byron, never, led, the, attack, on, navpaktos, because, the, souliotes, kept, demanding, that, byron, pay, them, more, and, more, money, before, they, would, march, byron, grew, tired, of, their, blackmail, and, sent, them, all, home, on, 15, february, 1824, byron, wrote, in, a, note, to, himself, having, tried, in, vain, at, every, expense, considerable, trouble, and, some, danger, to, unite, the, suliotes, for, the, good, of, greece, and, their, own, i, have, come, to, the, following, resolution, i, will, have, nothing, more, to, do, with, the, suliotes, they, may, go, to, the, turks, or, the, devil, they, may, cut, me, into, more, pieces, than, they, have, dissensions, among, them, sooner, than, change, my, resolution, at, the, same, time, guiccioli, s, brother, pietro, gamba, who, had, followed, byron, to, greece, exasperated, byron, with, his, incompetence, as, he, continually, made, expensive, mistakes, for, example, when, asked, to, buy, some, cloth, from, corfu, gamba, ordered, the, wrong, cloth, in, excess, causing, the, bill, to, be, 10, times, higher, than, what, byron, wanted, byron, wrote, about, his, right, hand, man, gamba, who, is, anything, but, lucky, had, something, to, do, with, it, and, as, usual, the, moment, he, had, matters, went, wrong, to, help, raise, money, for, the, revolution, byron, sold, his, estate, in, england, rochdale, manor, which, raised, some, 11, 250, this, led, byron, to, estimate, that, he, now, had, some, 20, 000, at, his, disposal, all, of, which, he, planned, to, spend, on, the, greek, cause, in, today, s, money, byron, would, have, been, a, millionaire, many, times, over, news, that, a, fabulously, wealthy, british, aristocrat, known, for, his, financial, generosity, had, arrived, in, greece, made, byron, the, object, of, much, solicitation, in, that, desperately, poor, country, byron, wrote, to, his, business, agent, in, england, i, should, not, like, to, give, the, greeks, but, a, half, helping, hand, saying, he, would, have, wanted, to, spend, his, entire, fortune, on, greek, freedom, byron, found, himself, besieged, by, various, people, both, greek, and, foreign, who, tried, to, persuade, him, to, open, his, pocketbook, for, support, by, the, end, of, march, 1824, the, so, called, byron, brigade, of, 30, philhellene, officers, and, about, 200, men, had, been, formed, paid, for, entirely, by, byron, leadership, of, the, greek, cause, in, the, roumeli, region, was, divided, between, two, rival, leaders, a, former, klepht, bandit, odysseas, androutsos, and, a, wealthy, phanariot, prince, alexandros, mavrokordatos, byron, used, his, prestige, to, attempt, to, persuade, the, two, rival, leaders, to, come, together, to, focus, on, defeating, the, ottomans, at, the, same, time, other, leaders, of, the, greek, factions, like, petrobey, mavromichalis, and, theodoros, kolokotronis, wrote, letters, to, byron, telling, him, to, disregard, all, of, the, roumeliot, leaders, and, to, come, to, their, respective, areas, in, the, peloponnese, this, drove, byron, to, distraction, he, complained, that, the, greeks, were, hopelessly, disunited, and, spent, more, time, feuding, with, each, other, than, trying, to, win, independence, byron, s, friend, edward, john, trelawny, had, aligned, himself, with, androutsos, who, ruled, athens, and, was, now, pressing, for, byron, to, break, with, mavrokordatos, in, favour, of, backing, the, rival, androutsos, androutsos, having, won, over, trelawny, to, his, cause, was, now, anxious, to, persuade, byron, to, put, his, wealth, behind, his, claim, to, be, the, leader, of, greece, byron, wrote, with, disgust, about, how, one, of, the, greek, captains, former, klepht, georgios, karaiskakis, attacked, missolonghi, on, 3, april, 1824, with, some, 150, men, supported, by, the, souliotes, as, he, was, unhappy, with, mavrokordatos, s, leadership, which, led, to, a, brief, bout, of, inter, greek, fighting, before, karaiskakis, was, chased, away, by, 6, april, when, the, famous, danish, sculptor, bertel, thorvaldsen, heard, about, byron, s, heroics, in, greece, he, voluntarily, resculpted, his, earlier, bust, of, byron, in, greek, marble, mavrokordatos, and, byron, planned, to, attack, the, turkish, held, fortress, of, lepanto, at, the, mouth, of, the, gulf, of, corinth, byron, employed, a, fire, master, to, prepare, artillery, and, he, took, part, of, the, rebel, army, under, his, own, command, despite, his, lack, of, military, experience, before, the, expedition, could, sail, on, 15, february, 1824, he, fell, ill, and, bloodletting, weakened, him, further, he, made, a, partial, recovery, but, in, early, april, he, caught, a, cold, the, therapeutic, bleeding, insisted, on, by, his, doctors, exacerbated, it, he, contracted, a, fever, and, died, in, missolonghi, on, 19, april, his, physician, at, the, time, julius, van, millingen, son, of, dutch, english, archaeologist, james, millingen, was, unable, to, prevent, his, death, it, has, been, said, that, if, byron, had, lived, and, had, gone, on, to, defeat, the, ottomans, he, might, have, been, declared, king, of, greece, however, modern, scholars, have, found, such, an, outcome, unlikely, the, british, historian, david, brewer, wrote, that, in, one, sense, byron, failed, to, persuade, the, rival, greek, factions, to, unite, won, no, victories, and, was, successful, only, in, the, humanitarian, sphere, using, his, great, wealth, to, help, the, victims, of, the, war, christian, and, muslim, but, this, did, not, affect, the, outcome, of, the, greek, war, of, independence, brewer, went, on, to, argue, in, another, sense, though, byron, achieved, everything, he, could, have, wished, his, presence, in, greece, and, in, particular, his, death, there, drew, to, the, greek, cause, not, just, the, attention, of, sympathetic, nations, but, their, increasing, active, participation, despite, the, critics, byron, is, primarily, remembered, with, admiration, as, a, poet, of, genius, with, something, approaching, veneration, as, a, symbol, of, high, ideals, and, with, great, affection, as, a, man, for, his, courage, and, his, ironic, slant, on, life, for, his, generosity, to, the, grandest, of, causes, and, to, the, humblest, of, individuals, for, the, constant, interplay, of, judgment, and, sympathy, in, greece, he, is, still, revered, as, no, other, foreigner, and, as, very, few, greeks, are, and, like, a, homeric, hero, he, is, accorded, an, honorific, standard, epithet, megalos, kai, kalos, a, great, and, good, man, alfred, tennyson, would, later, recall, the, shocked, reaction, in, britain, when, word, was, received, of, byron, s, death, the, greeks, mourned, lord, byron, deeply, and, he, became, a, hero, the, national, poet, of, greece, dionysios, solomos, wrote, a, poem, about, the, unexpected, loss, named, to, the, death, of, lord, byron, the, greek, form, of, byron, continues, in, popularity, as, a, masculine, name, in, greece, and, a, suburb, of, athens, is, called, vyronas, in, his, honour, byron, s, body, was, embalmed, but, the, greeks, wanted, some, part, of, their, hero, to, stay, with, them, according, to, some, sources, his, heart, remained, at, missolonghi, his, other, remains, were, sent, to, england, accompanied, by, his, faithful, manservant, tita, for, burial, in, westminster, abbey, but, the, abbey, refused, for, reason, of, questionable, morality, huge, crowds, viewed, his, coffin, as, he, lay, in, state, for, two, days, at, number, 25, great, george, street, westminster, he, is, buried, at, the, church, of, st, mary, magdalene, in, hucknall, nottinghamshire, a, marble, slab, given, by, the, king, of, greece, is, laid, directly, above, byron, s, grave, his, daughter, ada, lovelace, was, later, buried, beside, him, byron, s, friends, raised, 1, 000, to, commission, a, statue, of, the, writer, thorvaldsen, offered, to, sculpt, it, for, that, amount, however, after, the, statue, was, completed, in, 1834, for, ten, years, british, institutions, turned, it, down, and, it, remained, in, storage, it, was, refused, by, the, british, museum, st, paul, s, cathedral, westminster, abbey, and, the, national, gallery, before, trinity, college, cambridge, finally, placed, the, statue, of, byron, in, its, library, in, 1969, 145, years, after, byron, s, death, a, memorial, to, him, was, finally, placed, in, westminster, abbey, the, memorial, had, been, lobbied, for, since, 1907, when, the, new, york, times, wrote, people, are, beginning, to, ask, whether, this, ignoring, of, byron, is, not, a, thing, of, which, england, should, be, ashamed, a, bust, or, a, tablet, might, be, put, in, the, poets, corner, and, england, be, relieved, of, ingratitude, toward, one, of, her, really, great, sons, robert, ripley, had, drawn, a, picture, of, boatswain, s, grave, with, the, caption, lord, byron, s, dog, has, a, magnificent, tomb, while, lord, byron, himself, has, none, this, came, as, a, shock, to, the, english, particularly, schoolchildren, who, ripley, said, raised, funds, of, their, own, accord, to, provide, the, poet, with, a, suitable, memorial, close, to, the, centre, of, athens, greece, outside, the, national, garden, is, a, statue, depicting, greece, in, the, form, of, a, woman, crowning, byron, the, statue, is, by, the, french, sculptors, henri, michel, chapu, and, alexandre, falgui, re, as, of, 2008, the, anniversary, of, byron, s, death, 19, april, has, been, honoured, in, greece, as, byron, day, upon, his, death, the, barony, passed, to, byron, s, cousin, george, anson, byron, a, career, naval, officer, in, 1812, byron, embarked, on, a, well, publicised, affair, with, the, married, lady, caroline, lamb, that, shocked, the, british, public, she, had, spurned, the, attention, of, the, poet, on, their, first, meeting, subsequently, giving, byron, what, became, his, lasting, epitaph, when, she, famously, described, him, as, mad, bad, and, dangerous, to, know, this, did, not, prevent, her, from, pursuing, him, byron, eventually, broke, off, the, relationship, and, moved, swiftly, on, to, others, such, as, lady, oxford, but, lamb, never, entirely, recovered, pursuing, him, even, after, he, tired, of, her, she, was, emotionally, disturbed, and, lost, so, much, weight, that, byron, sarcastically, commented, to, her, mother, in, law, his, friend, lady, melbourne, that, he, was, haunted, by, a, skeleton, she, began, to, stalk, him, calling, on, him, at, home, sometimes, dressed, in, disguise, as, a, pageboy, at, a, time, when, such, an, act, could, ruin, both, of, them, socially, once, during, such, a, visit, she, wrote, on, a, book, at, his, desk, remember, me, as, a, retort, byron, wrote, a, poem, entitled, remember, thee, remember, thee, which, concludes, with, the, line, thou, false, to, him, thou, fiend, to, me, as, a, child, byron, had, seen, little, of, his, half, sister, augusta, leigh, in, adulthood, he, formed, a, close, relationship, with, her, that, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, incestuous, and, by, others, as, innocent, augusta, who, was, married, gave, birth, on, 15, april, 1814, to, her, third, daughter, elizabeth, medora, leigh, rumoured, by, some, to, be, byron, s, eventually, byron, began, to, court, lady, caroline, s, cousin, anne, isabella, milbanke, annabella, who, refused, his, first, proposal, of, marriage, but, later, accepted, him, milbanke, was, a, highly, moral, woman, intelligent, and, mathematically, gifted, she, was, also, an, heiress, they, married, at, seaham, hall, county, durham, on, 2, january, 1815, the, marriage, proved, unhappy, they, had, a, daughter, augusta, ada, on, 16, january, 1816, lady, byron, left, him, taking, ada, with, her, that, same, year, on, 21, april, byron, signed, the, deed, of, separation, rumours, of, marital, violence, adultery, with, actresses, incest, with, augusta, leigh, and, sodomy, were, circulated, assisted, by, a, jealous, lady, caroline, in, a, letter, augusta, quoted, him, as, saying, even, to, have, such, a, thing, said, is, utter, destruction, and, ruin, to, a, man, from, which, he, can, never, recover, that, same, year, lady, caroline, published, her, popular, novel, glenarvon, in, which, lord, byron, was, portrayed, as, the, seedy, title, character, byron, described, his, first, intense, romantic, sexual, feelings, at, the, age, of, seven, for, his, distant, cousin, mary, duff, my, mother, used, always, to, rally, me, about, this, childish, amour, and, at, last, many, years, after, when, i, was, sixteen, she, told, me, one, day, o, byron, i, have, had, a, letter, from, edinburgh, and, your, old, sweetheart, mary, duff, is, married, to, mr, c, and, what, was, my, answer, i, really, cannot, explain, or, account, for, my, feelings, at, that, moment, but, they, nearly, threw, me, into, convulsions, how, the, deuce, did, all, this, occur, so, early, where, could, it, originate, i, certainly, had, no, sexual, ideas, for, years, afterwards, and, yet, my, misery, my, love, for, that, girl, were, so, violent, that, i, sometimes, doubt, if, i, have, ever, been, really, attached, since, be, that, as, it, may, hearing, of, her, marriage, several, years, after, was, like, a, thunder, stroke, it, nearly, choked, me, to, the, horror, of, my, mother, and, the, astonishment, and, almost, incredulity, of, every, body, and, it, is, a, phenomenon, in, my, existence, for, i, was, not, eight, years, old, which, has, puzzled, and, will, puzzle, me, to, the, latest, hour, of, it, and, lately, i, know, not, why, the, recollection, not, the, attachment, has, recurred, as, forcibly, as, ever, but, the, more, i, reflect, the, more, i, am, bewildered, to, assign, any, cause, for, this, precocity, of, affection, byron, also, became, attached, to, margaret, parker, another, distant, cousin, while, his, recollection, of, his, love, for, mary, duff, is, that, he, was, ignorant, of, adult, sexuality, during, this, time, and, was, bewildered, as, to, the, source, of, the, intensity, of, his, feelings, he, would, later, confess, that, my, passions, were, developed, very, early, so, early, that, few, would, believe, me, if, i, were, to, state, the, period, and, the, facts, which, accompanied, it, perhaps, this, was, one, of, the, reasons, that, caused, the, anticipated, melancholy, of, my, thoughts, having, anticipated, life, this, is, the, only, reference, byron, himself, makes, to, the, event, and, he, is, ambiguous, as, to, how, old, he, was, when, it, occurred, after, his, death, his, lawyer, wrote, to, a, mutual, friend, telling, him, a, singular, fact, about, byron, s, life, which, was, scarcely, fit, for, narration, but, he, disclosed, it, nonetheless, thinking, it, might, explain, byron, s, sexual, propensities, when, nine, years, old, at, his, mother, s, house, a, free, scotch, girl, used, to, come, to, bed, to, him, and, play, tricks, with, his, person, gray, later, used, this, knowledge, as, a, means, of, ensuring, his, silence, if, he, were, to, be, tempted, to, disclose, the, low, company, she, kept, during, drinking, binges, she, was, later, dismissed, supposedly, for, beating, byron, when, he, was, 11, a, few, years, later, while, he, was, still, a, child, lord, grey, de, ruthyn, unrelated, to, may, gray, a, suitor, of, his, mother, s, also, made, sexual, advances, on, him, byron, s, personality, has, been, characterised, as, exceptionally, proud, and, sensitive, especially, when, it, came, to, his, foot, deformity, his, extreme, reaction, to, seeing, his, mother, flirting, outrageously, with, lord, grey, de, ruthyn, after, the, incident, suggests, he, did, not, tell, her, of, grey, s, conduct, toward, him, he, simply, refused, to, speak, to, him, again, and, ignored, his, mother, s, commands, to, be, reconciled, leslie, a, marchand, one, of, byron, s, biographers, theorises, that, lord, grey, de, ruthyn, s, advances, prompted, byron, s, later, sexual, liaisons, with, young, men, at, harrow, and, cambridge, scholars, acknowledge, a, more, or, less, important, bisexual, component, in, byron, s, very, complex, sentimental, and, sexual, life, bernhard, jackson, asserts, that, byron, s, sexual, orientation, has, long, been, a, difficult, not, to, say, contentious, topic, and, anyone, who, seeks, to, discuss, it, must, to, some, degree, speculate, since, the, evidence, is, nebulous, contradictory, and, scanty, it, is, not, so, simple, to, define, byron, as, homosexual, or, heterosexual, he, seems, rather, to, have, been, both, and, either, crompton, states, what, was, not, understood, in, byron, s, own, century, except, by, a, tiny, circle, of, his, associates, was, that, byron, was, bisexual, another, biographer, fiona, maccarthy, has, posited, that, byron, s, true, sexual, yearnings, were, for, adolescent, males, it, has, been, asserted, that, several, letters, to, byron, from, his, friend, charles, skinner, matthews, reveal, that, a, key, motive, for, byron, going, on, the, grand, tour, was, also, the, hope, of, homosexual, experiences, while, in, athens, byron, met, 14, year, old, nicolo, giraud, who, taught, him, italian, byron, arranged, to, have, giraud, enrolled, in, school, at, a, monastery, in, malta, and, wrote, him, into, his, will, with, a, bequest, of, 7, 000, about, 630, 000, in, 2024, that, will, however, was, later, cancelled, byron, wrote, to, hobhouse, from, athens, i, am, tired, of, pl, opt, cs, the, last, thing, i, could, be, tired, of, opt, cs, refers, to, a, quote, from, petronius, satyricon, coitum, plenum, et, optabilem, complete, intercourse, to, one, s, heart, s, desire, allegedly, byron, used, this, phrase, as, a, code, by, which, he, communicated, his, homosexual, greek, adventures, to, john, hobhouse, in, england, bernhard, jackson, recalls, that, byron, s, early, code, for, sex, with, a, boy, was, plen, um, and, optabil, em, coit, um, bullough, summarises, byron, was, attached, to, nicolo, giraud, a, young, french, greek, lad, who, had, been, a, model, for, the, painter, lusieri, before, byron, found, him, byron, left, him, 7, 000, in, his, will, when, byron, returned, to, italy, he, became, involved, with, a, number, of, boys, in, venice, but, eventually, settled, on, loukas, chalandritsanos, age, 15, who, was, with, him, when, he, was, killed, crompton, 1985, loukas, chalandritsanos, was, byron, s, greek, prot, g, whom, he, had, rescued, from, ithaca, during, byron, s, voyage, from, zakynthos, to, missolonghi, byron, took, loukas, as, his, page, but, was, concerned, that, the, boy, might, be, captured, by, the, turks, he, spoiled, the, teenage, chalandritsanos, outrageously, spending, some, 600, about, 70, 000, in, 2024, catering, to, his, every, whim, over, the, course, of, 6, months, on, his, deathbed, he, gave, loukas, a, bag, of, maria, theresa, crowns, and, a, 600, receipt, for, one, of, his, loans, to, the, greeks, but, the, government, was, in, no, position, to, honour, this, and, loukas, died, in, poverty, six, months, later, there, has, been, speculation, about, whether, the, relationship, between, byron, and, loukas, was, homosexual, pointing, to, some, of, byron, s, last, poem, verses, as, evidence, for, this, claim, byron, wrote, a, letter, to, john, hanson, from, newstead, abbey, dated, 17, january, 1809, that, includes, you, will, discharge, my, cook, laundry, maid, the, other, two, i, shall, retain, to, take, care, of, the, house, more, especially, as, the, youngest, is, pregnant, i, need, not, tell, you, by, whom, and, i, cannot, have, the, girl, on, the, parish, his, reference, to, the, youngest, is, understood, to, have, been, to, a, maid, lucy, and, the, parenthesised, remark, to, indicate, himself, as, siring, a, son, born, that, year, in, 2010, part, of, a, baptismal, record, was, uncovered, which, apparently, said, september, 24, george,

fathered, by, byron, who, was, augusta, s, half, brother, byron, had, a, child, the, hon, augusta, ada, byron, ada, later, countess, of, lovelace, in, 1815, by, his, wife, annabella, byron, lady, byron, n, e, anne, isabella, milbanke, or, annabella, later, lady, wentworth, ada, lovelace, notable, in, her, own, right, collaborated, with, charles, babbage, on, the, analytical, engine, a, predecessor, to, modern, computers, she, is, recognised, as, one, of, the, world, s, first, computer, programmers, he, also, had, an, extramarital, child, in, 1817, clara, allegra, byron, with, claire, clairmont, stepsister, of, mary, shelley, and, stepdaughter, of, william, godwin, writer, of, political, justice, and, caleb, williams, allegra, is, not, entitled, to, the, style, the, hon, as, is, usually, given, to, the, daughter, of, barons, since, she, was, born, outside, of, his, marriage, born, in, bath, in, 1817, allegra, lived, with, byron, for, a, few, months, in, venice, he, refused, to, allow, an, englishwoman, caring, for, the, girl, to, adopt, her, and, objected, to, her, being, raised, in, the, shelleys, household, he, wished, for, her, to, be, brought, up, catholic, and, not, marry, an, englishman, and, he, made, arrangements, for, her, to, inherit, 5, 000, lire, upon, marriage, or, when, she, reached, the, age, of, 21, provided, she, did, not, marry, a, native, of, britain, however, the, girl, died, aged, five, of, a, fever, in, bagnacavallo, italy, while, byron, was, in, pisa, he, was, deeply, upset, by, the, news, he, had, allegra, s, body, sent, back, to, england, to, be, buried, at, his, old, school, harrow, because, protestants, could, not, be, buried, in, consecrated, ground, in, catholic, countries, at, one, time, he, himself, had, wanted, to, be, buried, at, harrow, byron, was, antagonistic, towards, allegra, s, mother, claire, clairmont, and, prevented, her, from, seeing, the, child, during, his, time, in, greece, byron, took, interest, in, a, turkish, muslim, nine, year, old, girl, called, hato, or, hatag, e, which, he, seriously, considered, adopting, her, mother, was, a, wife, of, a, local, notable, from, messolonghi, who, at, the, time, was, a, domestic, servant, to, an, englishman, named, dr, millingen, the, rest, of, the, girl, s, family, had, either, fled, or, perished, after, the, greek, revolutionaries, took, over, messolonghi, byron, spent, nearly, 20, on, elaborate, dresses, for, hato, he, considered, sending, her, to, teresa, guiccioli, or, to, his, half, sister, augusta, or, to, his, estranged, wife, as, a, playmate, for, his, daughter, ada, ultimately, byron, sent, both, hato, and, her, mother, to, cephalonia, to, be, cared, for, temporarily, by, his, friend, james, kennedy, soon, after, byron, s, death, they, were, reunited, with, their, surviving, family, although, neglected, by, traditional, historiography, byron, had, a, complex, identity, and, strong, ties, to, scotland, his, maternal, family, the, gordons, had, its, roots, in, aberdeenshire, and, byron, was, educated, at, aberdeen, grammar, school, between, 1794, and, 1798, in, terms, of, his, own, identity, he, described, himself, as, half, a, scot, by, birth, and, bred, a, whole, one, and, he, reportedly, spoke, with, a, faint, scottish, accent, throughout, his, life, byron, was, regarded, as, a, scot, by, a, number, of, his, contemporaries, including, his, lover, lady, caroline, lamb, and, by, his, first, biographer, sir, cosmo, gordon, who, described, him, as, a, highlander, byron, s, links, to, scotland, were, demonstrated, in, his, campaign, for, the, liberation, of, greece, where, a, disproportionate, number, of, his, closest, friends, and, associates, had, strong, scottish, connexions, particularly, with, regard, to, north, eastern, scotland, which, through, his, gordon, links, remained, central, to, the, byronic, network, throughout, his, life, byron, enjoyed, adventure, especially, relating, to, the, sea, the, first, recorded, notable, example, of, open, water, swimming, took, place, on, 3, may, 1810, when, lord, byron, swam, from, europe, to, asia, across, the, hellespont, strait, this, is, often, seen, as, the, birth, of, the, sport, and, pastime, and, to, commemorate, it, the, event, is, recreated, every, year, as, an, open, water, swimming, event, whilst, sailing, from, genoa, to, cephalonia, in, 1823, every, day, at, noon, byron, and, trelawny, in, calm, weather, jumped, overboard, for, a, swim, without, fear, of, sharks, which, were, not, unknown, in, those, waters, once, according, to, trelawny, they, let, the, geese, and, ducks, loose, and, followed, them, and, the, dogs, into, the, water, each, with, an, arm, in, the, ship, captain, s, new, scarlet, waistcoat, to, the, annoyance, of, the, captain, and, the, amusement, of, the, crew, byron, had, a, great, love, of, animals, most, notably, for, a, newfoundland, dog, named, boatswain, when, the, animal, contracted, rabies, byron, nursed, him, albeit, unsuccessfully, without, any, thought, or, fear, of, becoming, bitten, and, infected, although, deeply, in, debt, at, the, time, byron, commissioned, an, impressive, marble, funerary, monument, for, boatswain, at, newstead, abbey, larger, than, his, own, and, the, only, building, work, that, he, ever, carried, out, on, his, estate, in, his, 1811, will, byron, requested, that, he, be, buried, with, him, the, 26, line, poem, epitaph, to, a, dog, has, become, one, of, his, best, known, works, but, a, draft, of, an, 1830, letter, by, hobhouse, shows, him, to, be, the, author, byron, decided, to, use, hobhouse, s, lengthy, epitaph, instead, of, his, own, which, read, to, mark, a, friend, s, remains, these, stones, arise, i, never, knew, but, one, and, here, he, lies, in, a, letter, sent, to, thomas, moore, byron, admitted, to, follow, a, diet, inspired, by, pythagoras, who, was, a, famous, vegetarian, byron, also, kept, a, tame, bear, while, he, was, a, student, at, trinity, out, of, resentment, for, rules, forbidding, pet, dogs, like, his, beloved, boatswain, there, being, no, mention, of, bears, in, their, statutes, the, college, authorities, had, no, legal, basis, for, complaining, byron, even, suggested, that, he, would, apply, for, a, college, fellowship, for, the, bear, during, his, lifetime, in, addition, to, numerous, cats, dogs, and, horses, byron, kept, a, fox, monkeys, an, eagle, a, crow, a, falcon, peacocks, guinea, hens, an, egyptian, crane, a, badger, geese, a, heron, and, a, goat, except, for, the, horses, they, all, resided, indoors, at, his, homes, in, england, switzerland, italy, and, greece, percy, shelley, visiting, byron, in, italy, in, 1821, described, his, menagerie, lord, b, s, establishment, consists, besides, servants, of, ten, horses, eight, enormous, dogs, three, monkeys, five, cats, an, eagle, a, crow, and, a, falcon, and, all, these, except, the, horses, walk, about, the, house, which, every, now, and, then, resounds, with, their, unarbitrated, quarrels, as, if, they, were, the, masters, of, it, p, s, i, find, that, my, enumeration, of, the, animals, in, this, circean, palace, was, defective, i, have, just, met, on, the, grand, staircase, five, peacocks, two, guinea, hens, and, an, egyptian, crane, byron, included, an, endorsement, of, vaccine, hesitancy, in, his, 1809, poem, english, bards, and, scotch, reviewers, he, writes, thus, saith, the, preacher, nought, beneath, the, sun, is, new, yet, still, from, change, to, change, we, run, what, varied, wonders, tempt, us, as, they, pass, the, cow, pox, tractors, galvanism, and, gas, in, turns, appear, to, make, the, vulgar, stare, till, the, swoln, bubble, bursts, and, all, is, air, byron, refers, to, cow, pox, a, reference, to, edward, jenner, s, smallpox, vaccine, he, compares, these, vaccines, with, tractors, a, fraudulent, medical, device, and, galvanism, which, was, understood, at, the, time, to, reference, the, reanimation, of, deceased, convicts, using, electricity, gas, was, likely, a, reference, to, nitrous, oxide, a, substance, recently, discovered, by, humphry, davy, to, treat, respiratory, ailments, the, deliberate, choice, to, frame, vaccines, as, similar, to, well, known, controversial, medical, treatments, shows, byron, s, tendency, toward, vaccine, hesitancy, in, his, writings, however, it, appears, he, held, different, views, in, private, as, he, had, his, protege, robert, rushton, inoculated, for, smallpox, i, am, such, a, strange, m, lange, of, good, and, evil, that, it, would, be, difficult, to, describe, me, as, a, boy, byron, s, character, is, described, as, a, mixture, of, affectionate, sweetness, and, playfulness, by, which, it, was, impossible, not, to, be, attached, although, he, also, exhibited, silent, rages, moody, sullenness, and, revenge, with, a, precocious, bent, for, attachment, and, obsession, from, birth, byron, had, a, deformity, of, his, right, foot, although, it, has, generally, been, referred, to, as, a, club, foot, some, modern, medical, authors, maintain, that, it, was, a, consequence, of, infantile, paralysis, poliomyelitis, and, others, that, it, was, a, dysplasia, a, failure, of, the, bones, to, form, properly, whatever, the, cause, he, was, affected, by, a, limp, that, caused, him, lifelong, psychological, and, physical, misery, aggravated, by, painful, and, pointless, medical, treatment, in, his, childhood, and, the, nagging, suspicion, that, with, proper, care, it, might, have, been, cured, he, was, extremely, self, conscious, about, this, from, a, young, age, nicknaming, himself, le, diable, bo, teux, french, for, the, limping, devil, after, the, nickname, given, to, asmodeus, by, alain, ren, lesage, in, his, 1707, novel, of, the, same, name, although, he, often, wore, specially, made, shoes, in, an, attempt, to, hide, the, deformed, foot, he, refused, to, wear, any, type, of, brace, that, might, improve, the, limp, scottish, novelist, john, galt, felt, his, oversensitivity, to, the, innocent, fault, in, his, foot, was, unmanly, and, excessive, because, the, limp, was, not, greatly, conspicuous, he, first, met, byron, on, a, voyage, to, sardinia, and, did, not, realise, he, had, any, deficiency, for, several, days, and, still, could, not, tell, at, first, if, the, lameness, was, a, temporary, injury, or, not, at, the, time, galt, met, him, he, was, an, adult, and, had, worked, to, develop, a, mode, of, walking, across, a, room, by, which, it, was, scarcely, at, all, perceptible, the, motion, of, the, ship, at, sea, may, also, have, helped, to, create, a, favourable, first, impression, and, hide, any, deficiencies, in, his, gait, but, galt, s, biography, is, also, described, as, being, rather, well, meant, than, well, written, so, galt, may, be, guilty, of, minimising, a, defect, that, was, actually, still, noticeable, byron, s, adult, height, was, 5, feet, 9, inches, 1, 75, m, his, weight, fluctuating, between, 9, 5, stone, 133, lb, 60, kg, and, 14, stone, 200, lb, 89, kg, he, was, renowned, for, his, personal, beauty, which, he, enhanced, by, wearing, curl, papers, in, his, hair, at, night, he, was, athletic, being, a, competent, boxer, and, horse, rider, and, an, excellent, swimmer, he, attended, pugilistic, tuition, at, the, bond, street, rooms, of, former, prizefighting, champion, gentleman, john, jackson, whom, byron, called, the, emperor, of, pugilism, and, recorded, these, sparring, sessions, in, his, letters, and, journals, byron, and, other, writers, such, as, his, friend, hobhouse, described, his, eating, habits, in, detail, at, the, time, he, entered, cambridge, he, went, on, a, strict, diet, to, control, his, weight, he, also, exercised, a, great, deal, and, at, that, time, wore, a, great, many, clothes, to, cause, himself, to, perspire, for, most, of, his, life, he, was, a, vegetarian, and, often, lived, for, days, on, dry, biscuits, and, white, wine, occasionally, he, would, eat, large, helpings, of, meat, and, desserts, after, which, he, would, purge, himself, although, he, is, described, by, galt, and, others, as, having, a, predilection, for, violent, exercise, hobhouse, suggests, that, the, pain, in, his, deformed, foot, made, physical, activity, difficult, and, that, his, weight, problem, was, the, result, trelawny, who, observed, byron, s, eating, habits, noted, that, he, lived, on, a, diet, of, biscuits, and, soda, water, for, days, at, a, time, and, then, would, eat, a, horrid, mess, of, cold, potatoes, rice, fish, or, greens, deluged, in, vinegar, and, gobble, it, up, like, a, famished, dog, byron, first, took, his, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, on, 13, march, 1809, but, left, london, on, 11, june, 1809, for, the, continent, byron, s, association, with, the, holland, house, whigs, provided, him, with, a, discourse, of, liberty, rooted, in, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, a, strong, advocate, of, social, reform, he, received, particular, praise, as, one, of, the, few, parliamentary, defenders, of, the, luddites, specifically, he, was, against, a, death, penalty, for, luddite, frame, breakers, in, nottinghamshire, who, destroyed, textile, machines, that, were, putting, them, out, of, work, his, first, speech, before, the, lords, on, 27, february, 1812, was, loaded, with, sarcastic, references, to, the, benefits, of, automation, which, he, saw, as, producing, inferior, material, as, well, as, putting, people, out, of, work, and, concluded, the, proposed, law, was, only, missing, two, things, to, be, effective, twelve, butchers, for, a, jury, and, a, jeffries, for, a, judge, byron, s, speech, was, officially, recorded, and, printed, in, hansard, he, said, later, that, he, spoke, very, violent, sentences, with, a, sort, of, modest, impudence, and, thought, he, came, across, as, a, bit, theatrical, the, full, text, of, the, speech, which, he, had, previously, written, out, was, presented, to, dallas, in, manuscript, form, and, he, quotes, it, in, his, work, two, months, later, in, conjunction, with, the, other, whigs, byron, made, another, impassioned, speech, before, the, house, of, lords, in, support, of, catholic, emancipation, byron, expressed, opposition, to, the, established, religion, because, it, was, unfair, to, people, of, other, faiths, these, experiences, inspired, byron, to, write, political, poems, such, as, song, for, the, luddites, 1816, and, the, landlords, interest, canto, xiv, of, the, age, of, bronze,

england, since, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, byron, published, the, first, two, cantos, anonymously, in, 1819, after, disputes, with, his, regular, publisher, over, the, shocking, nature, of, the, poetry, by, this, time, he, had, been, a, famous, poet, for, seven, years, and, when, he, self, published, the, beginning, cantos, they, were, well, received, in, some, quarters, the, poem, was, then, released, volume, by, volume, through, his, regular, publishing, house, by, 1822, cautious, acceptance, by, the, public, had, turned, to, outrage, and, byron, s, publisher, refused, to, continue, to,

byron, referred, to, wordsworth, as, turdsworth, byron, wrote, the, satirical, pamphlet, irish, avatar, after, the, royal, visit, by, king, george, iv, to, ireland, byron, criticised, the, attitudes, displayed, by, the, irish, people, towards, the, crown, an, institution, he, perceived, as, oppressing, them, and, was, dismayed, by, the, positive, reception, george, iv, received, during, his, visit, in, the, pamphlet, byron, lambasted, irish, unionists, and, voiced, muted, support, towards, nationalistic, sentiments, in, ireland, byron, was, a, bitter, opponent, of, lord, elgin, s, removal, of, the, parthenon, marbles, from, athens, and, reacted, with, fury, when, elgin, s, agent, gave, him, a, tour, of, the, parthenon, during, which, he, saw, the, spaces, left, by, the, missing, part, of, the, frieze, and, metopes, he, denounced, elgin, s, actions, in, his, poem, the, curse, of, minerva, and, in, canto, ii, stanzas, xi, xv, of, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, byron,

self, awareness, and, personal, promotion, are, seen, as, a, beginning, of, what, would, become, the, modern, rock, star, he, would, instruct, artists, painting, portraits, of, him, not, to, paint, him, with, pen, or, book, in, hand, but, as, a, man, of, action, while, byron, first, welcomed, fame, he, later, turned, from, it, by, going, into, voluntary, exile, from, britain, biographies, were, distorted, by, the, burning, of, byron, s, memoirs, in, the, offices, of, his, publisher, john, murray, a, month, after, his, death, and, the, suppression, of, details, of, byron, s, bisexuality, by, subsequent, heads, of, the, firm, which, held, the, richest, byron, archive, as, late, as, the, 1950s, scholar, leslie, marchand, was, expressly, forbidden, by, the, murray, company, to, reveal,

marked, influence, on, continental, literature, and, art, and, his, reputation, as, a, poet, is, higher, in, many, european, countries, than, in, britain, or, america, although, not, as, high, as, in, his, time, when, he, was, widely, thought, to, be, the, greatest, poet, in, the, world, byron, s, writings, also, inspired, many, composers, over, forty, operas, have, been, based, on, his, works, in,
