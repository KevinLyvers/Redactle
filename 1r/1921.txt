in, windsor, ontario, he, was, signed, by, the, red, wings, to, a, c, form, and, assigned, to, their, junior, team, the, galt, red, wings, due, to, the, maximum, number, of, western, players, allowed, by, the, league, and, the, red, wings, preference, to, develop, older, players, howe, s, playing, time, with, the, team, was, initially, limited, however, in, 1945, he, was, promoted, to, the, omaha,

wings, scoring, in, his, first, game, at, age, 18, he, wore, number, 17, as, a, rookie, however, when, roy, conacher, joined, the, chicago, black, hawks, after, the, 1946, 47, season, howe, was, offered, conacher, s, number, 9, which, he, would, wear, for, the, rest, of, his, career, although, he, had, not, requested, the, change, howe, accepted, it, when, he, was, informed, 9, would, entitle, him, to, a, lower, pullman, berth, on, road, trips, he, quickly, established, himself, as, a, great, goalscorer, and, a, gifted, playmaker, with, a, willingness, to, fight, howe, fought, so, often, in, his, rookie, season, that, head, coach, jack, adams, told, him, i, know, you, can, fight, now, can, you, show, me, you, can, play, hockey, the, term, gordie, howe, hat, trick, consisting, of, a, goal, an, assist, and, a, fight, was, coined, in, reference, to, his, penchant, for, fighting, however, howe, himself, only, recorded, two, such, hat, tricks, in, his, career, on, october, 10, 1953, and, march, 21, 1954, using, his, great, physical, strength, he, was, able, to, dominate, the, opposition, in, a, career, that, spanned, six, decades, including, one, game, with, the, detroit, vipers, of, the, ihl, in, 1997, in, a, feat, unsurpassed, by, any, hockey, player, he, finished, in, the, top, five, in, scoring, for, 20, straight, seasons, howe, also, scored, 20, or, more, goals, in, 22, consecutive, seasons, between, 1949, and, 1971, an, nhl, record, howe, led, detroit, to, four, stanley, cup, championships, and, to, first, place, in, regular, season, play, for, seven, consecutive, years, 1948, 49, to, 1954, 55, a, feat, never, equalled, in, nhl, history, during, this, time, howe, and, his, linemates, sid, abel, and, ted, lindsay, were, known, collectively, as, the, production, line, both, for, their, scoring, and, as, an, allusion, to, detroit, auto, factories, the, trio, dominated, the, nhl, in, such, a, fashion, that, in, 1949, 50, they, finished, one, two, three, in, nhl, scoring, this, was, despite, the, fact, howe, s, career, prime, was, during, a, defensive, era, when, scoring, was, difficult, and, checking, was, tight, however, as, he, was, emerging, as, one, of, the, top, players, in, the, league, howe, sustained, the, worst, injury, of, his, career, his, skull, was, fractured, and, his, cheekbone, and, nose, were, broken, after, his, attempt, to, check, the, toronto, maple, leafs, captain, ted, kennedy, into, the, boards, went, awry, during, the, 1950, playoffs, the, severity, of, the, fracture, was, such, that, he, was, taken, to, the, hospital, for, emergency, surgery, in, order, to, relieve, the, pressure, on, his, brain, he, missed, the, rest, of, the, playoffs, but, his, dominant, teammates, were, still, able, to, win, the, stanley, cup, the, next, season, 1950, 51, howe, came, back, responding, to, his, severe, injuries, by, playing, in, every, game, by, leading, the, nhl, in, goals, assists, and, total, points, 86, and, by, winning, the, scoring, title, by, 20, points, this, was, the, first, year, of, a, four, year, period, of, dominance, by, howe, which, the, nhl, had, never, seen, before, he, won, four, straight, scoring, titles, and, in, two, of, the, years, 1950, 51, and, 1952, 53, he, led, the, nhl, in, both, goals, and, assists, which, has, only, been, done, by, five, other, players, in, history, a, total, of, 10, times, aside, from, howe, in, three, of, those, years, he, led, the, nhl, in, goals, in, 1952, 53, howe, became, the, first, nhl, player, to, score, 90, points, finishing, the, season, with, 95, points, and, a, career, best, 49, goals, which, just, missed, tying, the, league, record, of, 50, goals, held, by, maurice, rocket, richard, albeit, in, a, 50, game, season, prior, to, howe, no, nhler, had, led, the, nhl, in, points, more, than, two, times, in, a, row, only, three, other, players, have, ever, matched, the, feat, of, winning, four, straight, scoring, titles, since, phil, esposito, jarom, r, j, gr, and, wayne, gretzky, who, won, seven, in, a, row, as, howe, emerged, as, one, of, the, game, s, superstars, he, was, frequently, compared, to, the, montreal, canadiens, maurice, richard, both, were, right, wingers, who, wore, 9, were, regular, challengers, for, the, league, scoring, title, and, could, also, play, roughly, if, needed, their, first, nhl, match, up, was, in, 1946, where, richard, hit, howe, with, a, hard, check, and, an, elbow, to, the, chin, howe, and, richard, never, got, to, fight, due, to, sid, abel, intervening, abel, received, a, broken, nose, howe, recalled, they, always, thought, there, was, bad, blood, because, i, hit, once, coming, across, the, line, and, he, spun, like, a, rocket, and, fell, down, he, wasn, t, hurt, that, much, and, i, started, to, laugh, but, the, laughter, stopped, when, there, were, eight, guys, on, me, howe, also, had, a, rivalry, with, the, canadiens, centre, jean, b, liveau, who, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, trying, to, strong, arm, gordie, off, the, puck, in, a, corner, was, akin, to, wrestling, with, a, telephone, pole, the, red, wings, and, canadiens, faced, off, in, four, stanley, cup, finals, during, the, 1950s, and, again, in, the, 1966, final, detroit, prevailed, in, 1952, 1954, and, 1955, but, montreal, triumphed, in, 1956, and, 1966, the, red, wings, also, had, a, fierce, rivalry, with, the, chicago, blackhawks, who, defeated, them, in, the, 1961, stanley, cup, finals, chicago, s, stan, mikita, recalled, one, time, as, a, rookie, when, he, slashed, howe, saying, he, was, an, old, man, who, didn, t, belong, on, the, ice, later, in, the, season, howe, exacted, revenge, with, a, check, that, gave, mikita, a, concussion, bobby, hull, recalled, the, times, he, and, howe, played, against, each, other, saying, i, enjoyed, every, high, sticking, minute, of, it, describing, howe, as, strong, as, a, bull, and, tougher, than, a, night, in, jail, in, the, 1968, all, star, game, where, hull, and, howe, were, teammates, for, the, first, time, hull, said, it, was, nice, finally, having, gordie, on, my, side, he, was, no, fun, playing, against, hull, and, howe, would, also, be, rivals, in, the, world, hockey, association, wha, as, members, of, the, winnipeg, jets, and, houston, aeros, respectively, and, would, be, reunited, as, teammates, on, the, hartford, whalers, where, they, finished, off, their, playing, careers, after, being, consistent, contenders, through, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, red, wings, began, to, slump, in, the, late, 1960s, when, howe, turned, 40, in, 1967, 68, the, nhl, expanded, from, 6, to, 12, teams, and, the, number, of, scoring, opportunities, grew, as, the, game, schedule, increased, howe, played, the, 1968, 69,

point, season, conflict, arose, with, the, red, wings, after, howe, discovered, he, was, just, the, third, highest, paid, player, on, the, team, with, a, 45, 000, salary, while, team, owner, bruce,
