were, attacked, by, johann, eck, he, replied, based, on, the, authority, of, scripture, in, his, defensio, contra, johannem, eckium, wittenberg, 1519, following, lectures, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, and, the, epistle, to, the, romans, together, with, his, investigations, into, pauline, doctrine, he, was, granted, the, degree, of, bachelor, of, theology, and, transferred, to, the,

and, magdalen, in, the, beginning, of, 1521, melanchthon, defended, luther, in, his, didymi, faventini, versus, thomam, placentinum, pro, m, luthero, oratio, wittenberg, n, d, he, argued, that, luther, rejected, only, papal, and, ecclesiastical, practises, which, were, at, variance, with, scripture, but, while, luther, was, absent, at, wartburg, castle, during, the, disturbances, caused, by, the, zwickau, prophets, melanchthon, wavered, the, appearance, of, melanchthon, s, loci, communes, rerum, theologicarum, seu, hypotyposes, theologicae, wittenberg, and, basel, 1521, was, of, subsequent, importance, to, the, reformation, melanchthon, discussed, the, leading, thoughts, of, paul, s, letter, to, the, romans, and, used, this, platform, to, present, a, new, doctrine, of, christianity, one, where, faith, in, god, was, more, important, than, good, deeds, loci, communes, contributed, to, the, gradual, rise, of, the, lutheran, scholastic, tradition, and, the, later, theologians, martin, chemnitz, mathias, haffenreffer, and, leonhard, hutter, expanded, upon, it, melanchthon, continued, to, lecture, on, the, classics, on, a, journey, in, 1524, to, his, native, town, he, encountered, the, papal, legate, cardinal, lorenzo, campeggio, who, tried, to, draw, him, from, luther, s, cause, in, his, unterricht, der, visitatorn, an, die, pfarherrn, im, kurf, rstentum, zu, sachssen, 1528, melanchthon, presented, the, evangelical, doctrine, of, salvation, as, well, as, regulations, for, churches, and, schools, in, 1529, melanchthon, accompanied, the, elector, to, the, diet, of, speyer, his, hopes, of, persuading, the, holy, roman, empire, to, recognize, the, reformation, were, not, fulfilled, a, friendly, attitude, towards, the, swiss, at, the, diet, was, something, he, later, changed, calling, huldrych, zwingli, s, doctrine, of, the, lord, s, supper, an, impious, dogma, the, composition, now, known, as, the, augsburg, confession, was, presented, at, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, 1530, and, would, come, to, be, considered, perhaps, the, most, significant, document, of, the, protestant, reformation, while, the, confession, was, based, on, luther, s, marburg, and, schwabach, articles, it, was, mainly, the, work, of, melanchthon, although, it, was, commonly, thought, of, as, a, unified, statement, of, doctrine, by, the, two, reformers, luther, did, not, conceal, his, dissatisfaction, with, its, irenic, tone, indeed, some, would, criticize, melanchthon, s, conduct, at, the, diet, as, unbecoming, of, the, principle, he, promoted, implying, that, faith, in, the, truth, of, his, cause, should, logically, have, inspired, melanchthon, to, a, firmer, and, more, dignified, posture, others, point, out, that, he, had, not, sought, the, part, of, a, political, leader, suggesting, that, he, seemed, to, lack, the, requisite, energy, and, decision, for, such, a, role, and, may, simply, have, been, a, lackluster, judge, of, human, nature, melanchthon, represented, luther, at, the, conference, as, luther, was, barred, from, attending, charles, v, had, called, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, order, to, unite, religious, groups, in, the, face, of, a, potential, war, with, the, ottoman, empire, however, despite, all, efforts, and, attempts, at, compromise, there, was, no, reconciliation, between, catholics, and, lutherans, after, the, confession, was, discussed, and, official, response, the, pontifical, confutation, of, the, augsburg, confession, was, produced, melanchthon, wrote, a, reply, to, this, which, became, known, as, the, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, melanchthon, then, settled, into, the, comparative, quiet, of, his, academic, and, literary, labours, his, most, important, theological, work, of, this, period, was, the, commentarii, in, epistolam, pauli, ad, romanos, wittenberg, 1532, noteworthy, for, introducing, the, idea, that, to, be, justified, means, to, be, accounted, just, whereas, the, apology, had, placed, side, by, side, the, meanings, of, to, be, made, just, and, to, be, accounted, just, melanchthon, s, increasing, fame, gave, occasion, for, prestigious, invitations, to, t, bingen, september, 1534, france, and, england, but, consideration, of, the, elector, caused, him, to, refuse, them, in, 1540, he, produced, a, revised, edition, the, variata, which, was, signed, by, john, calvin, the, main, difference, is, in, the, treatment, of, transubstantiation, in, the, lord, s, supper, many, lutheran, churches, specify, that, they, subscribe, to, the, unaltered, augsburg, confession, as, opposed, to, the, variata, melanchthon, played, an, important, role, in, discussions, concerning, the, lord, s, supper, which, began, in, 1531, he, approved, of, bucer, s, wittenberg, concord, and, discussed, the, question, with, bucer, in, kassel, in, 1534, he, worked, for, an, agreement, on, this, question, as, his, patristic, studies, and, the, dialogue, 1530, of, johannes, oecolampadius, had, made, him, doubt, the, correctness, of, luther, s, doctrine, zwingli, s, death, and, the, change, of, the, political, situation, changed, his, earlier, stance, in, regard, to, a, union, bucer, did, not, go, so, far, as, to, believe, with, luther, that, the, true, body, of, christ, in, the, lord, s, supper, is, bitten, by, the, teeth, but, admitted, the, offering, of, the, body, and, blood, in, the, symbols, of, bread, and, wine, melanchthon, discussed, bucer, s, views, with, luther, s, adherent, but, luther, himself, would, not, agree, to, a, veiling, of, the, dispute, melanchthon, s, relationship, with, luther, was, not, changed, by, his, mediation, work, although, for, a, time, luther, suspected, that, melanchthon, was, almost, of, the, opinion, of, zwingli, during, his, time, in, t, bingen, in, 1536, melanchthon, was, heavily, criticised, by, cordatus, preacher, in, niemeck, as, he, had, taught, that, works, are, necessary, for, salvation, in, the, second, edition, of, his, loci, 1535, he, abandoned, his, earlier, strict, doctrine, of, determinism, and, instead, taught, what, he, called, synergism, he, repudiated, cordatus, criticism, in, a, letter, to, luther, and, his, other, colleagues, stating, that, he, had, never, departed, from, their, common, teachings, on, this, subject, and, in, the, antinomian, controversy, of, 1537, melanchthon, was, in, harmony, with, luther, melanchthon, faced, controversies, over, the, interims, and, the, adiaphora, 1547, he, rejected, the, augsburg, interim, which, the, emperor, wished, to, impose, during, negotiations, concerning, the, leipzig, interim, he, made, controversial, concessions, in, agreeing, to, various, catholic, usages, melanchthon, held, the, opinion, that, they, are, adiaphora, if, nothing, is, changed, in, the, pure, doctrine, and, the, sacraments, which, jesus, instituted, however, he, disregarded, the, position, that, concessions, made, under, such, circumstances, have, to, be, regarded, as, a, denial, of, evangelical, convictions, melanchthon, later, regretted, his, actions, after, luther, s, death, he, became, seen, by, many, as, the, theological, leader, of, the, german, reformation, although, the, gnesio, lutherans, led, by, matthias, flacius, accused, him, and, his, followers, of, heresy, and, apostasy, melanchthon, bore, the, accusations, with, patience, dignity, and, self, control, in, his, controversy, on, justification, with, andreas, osiander, melanchthon, satisfied, all, parties, he, took, part, also, in, a, controversy, with, stancaro, who, held, that, christ, was, our, justification, only, according, to, his, human, nature, in, 1552, the, elector, of, saxony, declared, himself, ready, to, send, deputies, to, a, council, to, be, convened, at, trent, but, only, under, the, condition, that, the, protestants, should, have, a, share, in, the, discussions, and, that, the, pope, should, not, be, considered, as, the, presiding, officer, and, judge, this, declaration, was, partly, due, to, advice, from, melanchthon, as, it, was, agreed, upon, to, send, a, confession, to, trent, melanchthon, drew, up, the, confessio, saxonica, a, repetition, of, the, augsburg, confession, discussing, in, greater, detail, the, points, of, controversy, with, rome, on, his, way, to, trent, at, dresden, in, march, 1552, he, saw, the, military, preparations, of, maurice, of, saxony, and, after, reaching, nuremberg, he, returned, to, wittenberg, as, maurice, had, turned, against, the, emperor, after, his, return, the, condition, of, the, protestants, became, more, favourable, and, were, still, more, so, at, the, peace, of, augsburg, 1555, however, melanchthon, s, difficulties, increased, from, that, time, the, last, years, of, his, life, were, embittered, by, disputes, over, the, interim, and, the, freshly, started, controversy, on, the, lord, s, supper, as, the, statement, good, works, are, necessary, for, salvation, appeared, in, the, leipzig, interim, in, 1551, its, lutheran, opponents, attacked, georg, major, melanchthon, s, friend, and, disciple, melanchthon, dropped, the, formula, altogether, seeing, how, easily, it, could, be, misunderstood, his, opponents, continued, to, go, against, him, accusing, him, of, synergism, and, zwinglianism, at, the, colloquy, of, worms, in, 1557, which, he, had, reluctantly, attended, the, adherents, of, flacius, and, the, saxon, theologians, tried, to, humiliate, him, as, a, heretic, melanchthon, persevered, in, his, efforts, for, the, peace, of, the, church, suggesting, a, synod, of, the, evangelical, party, and, drawing, up, the, frankfurt, recess, which, he, defended, later, against, attacks, the, controversies, on, the, lord, s, supper, embittered, the, last, years, of, his, life, the, renewal, of, this, dispute, was, due, to, the, growing, acceptance, of, calvinistic, doctrine, and, its, influence, upon, germany, he, never, agreed, with, this, and, the, personal, presence, and, self, impartation, of, christ, in, the, lord, s, supper, were, especially, important, for, him, although, he, did, not, definitely, state, how, body, and, blood, are, related, to, this, although, rejecting, the, physical, act, of, mastication, he, nevertheless, assumed, the, real, presence, of, the, body, of, christ, and, therefore, also, a, real, self, impartation, he, also, differed, from, calvin, in, emphasizing, the, relation, of, the, lord, s, supper, to, justification, melanchthon, viewed, any, veneration, of, saints, rather, critically, but, he, developed, positive, commentaries, about, mary, in, his, annotations, in, evangelia, he, wrote, a, study, on, luke, 2, 52, and, discussed, mary, s, faith, he, noted, that, she, kept, all, things, in, her, heart, which, to, him, was, a, call, to, the, church, to, follow, her, example, he, believed, that, mary, was, negligent, when, she, lost, her, son, in, the, temple, but, she, did, not, sin, he, also, believed, that, mary, was, conceived, with, original, sin, like, every, other, human, being, but, she, was, spared, the, consequences, of, it, as, such, he, opposed, the, feast, of, the, immaculate, conception, which, at, the, time, was, not, dogma, but, was, celebrated, in, several, cities, and, had, been, approved, at, the, council, of, basel, in, 1439, he, declared, that, the, immaculate, conception, was, an, invention, of, monks, he, saw, mary, as, a, representation, typus, of, the, church, and, believed, that, in, the, magnificat, mary, spoke, for, the, whole, church, standing, under, the, cross, mary, suffered, like, no, other, human, being, as, such, he, believed, that, christians, have, to, unite, with, her, under, the, cross, in, order, to, become, christ, like, in, lecturing, on, the, librorum, de, judiciis, astrologicis, of, ptolemy, in, 1535, 1536, melanchthon, expressed, to, students, his, interest, in, greek, mathematics, astronomy, and, astrology, he, considered, that, a, purposeful, god, had, reasons, to, exhibit, comets, and, eclipses, he, was, the, first, to, print, a, paraphrased, edition, of, ptolemy, s, tetrabiblos, in, basel, 1554, natural, philosophy, in, his, view, was, directly, linked, to, providence, a, point, of, view, that, was, influential, in, curriculum, change, after, the, protestant, reformation, in, germany, in, the, period, 1536, 1539, he, was, involved, in, three, academic, innovations, the, refoundation, of, wittenberg, along, protestant, lines, the, reorganization, at, t, bingen, and, the, foundation, of, the, university, of, leipzig, before, these, theological, dissensions, were, settled, melanchthon, died, only, a, few, days, before, his, death, he, had, written, a, note, which, gave, his, reasons, for, not, fearing, death, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, note, were, the, words, you, will, be, delivered, from, sins, and, be, freed, from, the, acrimony, and, fury, of, theologians, on, the, right, you, will, go, to, the, light, see, god, look, upon, his, son, learn, those, wonderful, mysteries, which, you, have, not, been, able, to, understand, in, this, life, the, immediate, cause, of, death, was, a, severe, cold, which, he, had, contracted, on, a, journey, to, leipzig, in, march, 1560, followed, by, a, fever, that, consumed, his, strength, although, his, body, had, already, been, weakened, he, was, pronounced, dead, on, 19, april, 1560, his, body, was, buried, beside, luther, s, in, the, schlo, kirche, in, wittenberg, in, melanchthon, s, last, moments, he, continued, to, worry, over, the, desolate, condition, of, the, church, he, prayed, continually, and, listened, to, passages, of, scripture, the, words, of, john, 1, 11, 12, were, especially, significant, to, him, his, own, received, him, not, but, as, many, as, received, him, to, them, gave, he, power, to, become, the, sons, of, god, when, caspar, peucer, his, son, in, law, asked, him, if, he, wanted, anything, he, replied, nothing, but, heaven, he, is, commemorated, in, the, calendar, of, saints, of, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, on, 16, february, his, birthday, and, in, the, calendar, of, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, on, 25, june, the, date, of, the, presentation, of, the, augsburg, confession, melanchthon, s, importance, for, the, reformation, lay, essentially, in, the, fact, that, he, systematized, luther, s, ideas, defended, them, in, public, and, made, them, the, basis, of, a, religious, education, these, two, figures, by, complementing, each, other, could, be, said, to, have, harmoniously, achieved, the, results, of, the, reformation, melanchthon, was, impelled, by, luther, to, work, for, the, reformation, his, own, inclinations, would, have, kept, him, in, academia, without, luther, s, influence, he, could, have, been, a, second, erasmus, although, he, had, a, deep, religious, interest, in, the, reformation, while, luther, scattered, the, sparks, among, the, people, melanchthon, had, the, sympathy, of, educated, people, and, scholars, both, luther, s, strength, of, faith, and, melanchthon, s, calmness, temperance, and, love, of, peace, had, a, share, in, the, success, of, the, movement, both, were, aware, of, their, mutual, position, and, they, thought, of, it, as, a, divine, necessity, melanchthon, wrote, in, 1520, i, would, rather, die, than, be, separated, from, luther, whom, he, also, compared, to, elijah, and, called, him, the, man, full, of, the, holy, ghost, in, spite, of, the, strained, relations, between, them, in, the, last, years, of, luther, s, life, melanchthon, said, at, luther, s, death, dead, is, the, horseman, and, chariot, of, israel, who, ruled, the, church, in, this, last, age, of, the, world, in, the, preface, to, melanchthon, s, kolosserkommentar, 1529, luther, wrote, i, had, to, fight, with, rabble, and, devils, for, which, reason, my, books, are, very, warlike, i, am, the, rough, pioneer, who, must, break, the, road, but, master, philip, comes, along, softly, and, gently, sows, and, waters, heartily, since, god, has, richly, endowed, him, with, gifts, luther, also, praised, melanchthon, s, revised, loci, and, called, him, a, divine, instrument, which, has, achieved, the, very, best, in, the, department, of, theology, to, the, great, rage, of, the, devil, and, his, scabby, tribe, luther, never, spoke, directly, against, melanchthon, however, often, he, was, dissatisfied, with, melanchthon, s, actions, he, never, uttered, a, word, against, his, private, character, although, melanchthon, sometimes, evinced, a, lack, of, confidence, in, luther, in, a, letter, to, carlowitz, before, the, diet, of, augsburg, he, protested, that, luther, with, his, hot, headed, nature, exercised, a, personally, humiliating, pressure, upon, him, the, distinction, between, luther, and, melanchthon, is, well, brought, out, in, luther, s, letters, to, the, latter, june, 1530, to, your, great, anxiety, by, which, you, are, made, weak, i, am, a, cordial, foe, for, the, cause, is, not, ours, it, is, your, philosophy, and, not, your, theology, which, tortures, you, so, as, though, you, could, accomplish, anything, by, your, useless, anxieties, so, far, as, the, public, cause, is, concerned, i, am, well, content, and, satisfied, for, i, know, that, it, is, right, and, true, and, what, is, more, it, is, the, cause, of, christ, and, god, himself, for, that, reason, i, am, merely, a, spectator, if, we, fall, christ, will, likewise, fall, and, if, he, fall, i, would, rather, fall, with, christ, than, stand, with, the, emperor, as, a, reformer, melanchthon, s, work, was, characterized, by, moderation, conscientiousness, caution, and, love, of, peace, however, these, qualities, were, sometimes, said, to, only, be, lack, of, decision, consistence, and, courage, his, main, priority, was, for, the, welfare, of, the, community, and, for, the, quiet, development, of, the, church, melanchthon, had, an, innate, aversion, to, quarrels, and, discord, yet, often, he, was, very, irritable, his, irenical, character, often, led, him, to, adapt, himself, to, the, views, of, others, as, may, be, seen, from, his, correspondence, with, erasmus, and, from, his, public, attitude, from, the, diet, of, augsburg, to, the, interim, it, was, said, not, to, be, merely, a, personal, desire, for, peace, but, his, conservative, religious, nature, that, guided, him, in, his, acts, of, conciliation, he, never, could, forget, that, his, father, on, his, death, bed, had, besought, his, family, never, to, leave, the, church, he, stood, toward, the, history, of, the, church, in, an, attitude, of, piety, and, reverence, that, made, it, much, more, difficult, for, him, than, for, luther, to, be, content, with, the, thought, of, the, impossibility, of, a, reconciliation, with, the, catholic, church, he, laid, stress, upon, the, authority, of, the, church, fathers, not, only, of, augustine, but, also, of, the, greek, fathers, his, attitude, in, matters, of, worship, was, conservative, and, in, the, leipsic, interim, he, was, said, by, cordatus, and, schenk, even, to, be, crypto, catholic, he, did, not, look, for, a, reconciliation, with, catholicism, at, the, price, of, pure, doctrine, he, attributed, more, value, to, the, external, appearance, and, organization, of, the, church, than, luther, did, as, can, be, seen, from, his, treatment, of, the, doctrine, of, the, church, the, ideal, conception, of, the, church, which, he, expressed, in, loci, in, 1535, later, lost, its, prominence, when, he, began, to, emphasize, the, conception, of, the, true, visible, church, as, it, may, be, found, among, the, protestants, he, believed, that, the, relation, of, the, church, to, god, was, that, the, church, held, the, divine, office, of, the, ministry, of, the, gospel, the, universal, priesthood, was, for, melanchthon, as, for, luther, no, principle, of, an, ecclesiastical, constitution, but, a, purely, religious, principle, in, accordance, with, this, idea, he, tried, to, keep, the, traditional, church, constitution, and, government, including, the, bishops, he, did, not, want, however, a, church, altogether, independent, of, the, state, but, rather, in, agreement, with, luther, he, believed, it, the, duty, of, the, secular, authorities, to, protect, religion, and, the, church, he, looked, upon, the, consistories, as, ecclesiastical, courts, which, therefore, should, be, composed, of, spiritual, and, secular, judges, as, he, believed, that, the, official, authority, of, the, church, did, not, lie, in, a, special, class, of, priests, but, rather, in, the, whole, congregation, to, be, represented, therefore, not, only, by, ecclesiastics, but, also, by, laymen, in, advocating, church, union, he, did, not, overlook, differences, in, doctrine, for, the, sake, of, common, practical, tasks, the, older, he, grew, the, less, he, distinguished, between, the, gospel, as, the, announcement, of, the, will, of, god, and, right, doctrine, as, the, human, knowledge, of, it, he, took, pains, to, safeguard, unity, in, doctrine, by, theological, formulas, of, union, but, these, were, made, as, broad, as, possible, and, were, restricted, to, the, needs, of, practical, religion, as, a, scholar, melanchthon, embodied, the, spiritual, culture, of, his, age, his, writing, was, simple, and, clear, his, manuals, even, if, they, were, not, always, original, were, quickly, introduced, into, schools, and, kept, their, place, for, more, than, a, century, for, him, knowledge, existed, only, for, the, service, of, moral, and, religious, education, and, so, the, teacher, of, germany, prepared, the, way, for, the, religious, thoughts, of, the, reformation, he, was, an, important, figure, in, the, movement, known, as, christian, humanism, which, exerted, a, lasting, influence, upon, scientific, life, in, germany, melanchthon, wrote, many, treatises, on, education, and, learning, that, present, some, of, his, views, on, the, basis, method, and, goal, of, reformed, education, in, his, book, of, visitation, melanchthon, outlines, a, school, plan, that, recommends, schools, to, teach, latin, only, he, suggests, children, should, be, broken, up, into, three, distinct, groups, children, who, are, learning, to, read, children, who, know, how, to, read, and, are, ready, to, learn, grammar, and, children, who, are, well, trained, in, grammar, and, syntax, melanchthon, also, believed, that, the, disciplinary, system, of, the, classical, seven, liberal, arts, and, the, sciences, studied, in, the, higher, faculties, could, not, encompass, the, new, revolutionary, discoveries, of, the, age, in, terms, of, either, content, or, method, he, expanded, the, traditional, categorization, of, science, in, several, directions, incorporating, not, only, history, geography, and, poetry, but, also, the, new, natural, sciences, in, his, system, of, scholarly, disciplines, as, a, theologian, his, strength, lay, in, collecting, and, systematizing, the, ideas, of, others, especially, of, luther, for, the, purpose, of, instruction, he, kept, to, the, practical, and, did, not, look, at, the, connection, of, the, parts, and, his, loci, were, in, the, form, of, isolated, paragraphs, his, humanistic, mode, of, thought, formed, the, basis, of, his, theology, so, that, he, acknowledged, moral, and, religious, truths, outside, of, christianity, and, brought, christian, truth, into, closer, contact, with, them, to, mediate, between, christian, revelation, and, ancient, philosophy, melanchthon, s, views, differed, from, luther, s, only, in, some, modifications, of, ideas, melanchthon, looked, upon, the, law, as, not, only, the, correlate, of, the, gospel, but, as, the, unchangeable, order, of, the, spiritual, world, with, its, basis, in, god, himself, he, distilled, luther, s, view, of, redemption, to, that, of, legal, satisfaction, he, did, not, focus, on, the, mysticism, running, through, luther, s, theology, but, emphasized, the, ethical, and, intellectual, elements, after, giving, up, determinism, and, absolute, predestination, and, ascribing, a, certain, moral, freedom, to, humanity, he, tried, to, ascertain, the, share, of, free, will, in, conversion, naming, three, causes, as, concurring, in, the, work, of, conversion, the, word, the, spirit, and, the, human, will, which, was, not, passive, but, resisting, its, own, weakness, after, 1548, he, used, erasmus, definition, of, freedom, the, capability, of, applying, oneself, to, grace, in, dividing, faith, into, knowledge, assent, and, trust, he, made, the, participation, of, the, heart, subsequent, to, that, of, the, intellect, which, gave, rise, to, the, view, of, the, later, orthodoxy, that, the, establishment, and, acceptation, of, pure, doctrine, should, precede, the, personal, attitude, of, faith, his, conception, of, faith, corresponded, with, his, view, that, the, church, is, the, communion, of, those, who, adhere, to, the, true, belief, and, that, her, visible, existence, depends, upon, the, consent, of, her, unregenerated, members, to, her, teachings, melanchthon, s, doctrine, of, the, lord, s, supper, lacked, the, mysticism, of, faith, by, which, luther, united, the, sensual, elements, and, supersensual, realities, it, did, however, demand, their, formal, distinction, the, development, of, melanchthon, s, beliefs, may, be, seen, from, the, history, of, the, loci, originally, he, intended, a, development, of, the, leading, ideas, representing, the, evangelical, conception, of, salvation, while, the, later, editions, approached, a, plan, of, a, text, book, of, dogma, at, first, he, insisted, on, the, necessity, of, every, event, rejected, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, and, had, not, fully, developed, his, doctrine, of, the, sacraments, in, 1535, he, treated, for, the, first, time, the, doctrine, of, god, and, that, of, the, trinity, he, rejected, the, doctrine, of, the, necessity, of, every, event, and, named, free, will, as, a, concurring, cause, in, conversion, the, doctrine, of, justification, received, its, forensic, form, and, the, necessity, of, good, works, was, emphasized, in, the, interest, of, moral, discipline, the, last, editions, are, distinguished, from, the, earlier, ones, by, the, prominence, given, to, the, theoretical, and, rational, element, in, ethics, he, preserved, and, renewed, the, tradition, of, ancient, morality, and, represented, the, protestant, conception, of, life, his, books, on, morals, were, chiefly, drawn, from, the, classics, and, were, influenced, not, so, much, by, aristotle, as, by, cicero, his, principal, works, in, this, line, were, prolegomena, to, cicero, s, de, officiis, 1525, enarrationes, librorum, ethicorum, aristotelis, 1529, epitome, philosophiae, moralis, 1538, and, ethicae, doctrinae, elementa, 1550, in, his, epitome, philosophiae, moralis, he, considers, the, relation, of, philosophy, to, the, law, of, god, and, the, gospel, moral, principles, are, knowable, in, the, light, of, reason, melanchthon, calls, these, the, law, of, god, and, being, endowed, in, human, nature, by, god, so, also, the, law, of, nature, the, virtuous, pagans, had, not, yet, developed, the, ideas, of, original, sin, and, the, fall, or, the, fallen, aspect, of, human, nature, itself, and, so, could, not, articulate, or, explain, why, humans, did, not, always, act, virtuously, if, virtue, was, the, true, law, of, human, nature, having, been, put, there, by, god, himself, than, the, light, of, reason, could, only, be, darkened, by, sin, the, revealed, law, necessitated, because, of, sin, is, distinguished, from, natural, law, only, by, its, greater, completeness, and, clearness, the, fundamental, order, of, moral, life, can, be, grasped, also, by, reason, therefore, the, development, of, moral, philosophy, from, natural, principles, must, not, be, neglected, melanchthon, therefore, made, no, sharp, distinction, between, natural, and, revealed, morals, his, contribution, to, christian, ethics, in, the, proper, sense, can, be, seen, in, the, augsburg, confession, and, its, apology, as, well, as, in, his, loci, where, he, followed, luther, in, depicting, the, protestant, ideal, of, life, the, free, realization, of, the, divine, law, by, a, personality, blessed, in, faith, and, filled, with, the, spirit, of, god, melanchthon, s, formulation, of, the, authority, of, scripture, became, the, norm, for, some, time, the, principle, of, his, hermeneutics, is, expressed, in, his, words, every, theologian, and, faithful, interpreter, of, the, heavenly, doctrine, must, necessarily, be, first, a, grammarian, then, a, dialectician, and, finally, a, witness, by, grammarian, he, meant, the, philologist, who, is, master, of, history, archaeology, and, ancient, geography, for, the, method, of, interpretation, he, insisted, on, the, unity, of, the, sense, and, upon, the, literal, sense, in, contrast, to, the, four, senses, of, the, scholastics, he, further, stated, that, whatever, is, looked, for, in, the, words, of, scripture, outside, of, the, literal, sense, is, only, dogmatic, or, practical, application, his, commentaries, are, full, of, theological, and, practical, matter, confirming, the, doctrines, of, the, reformation, the, most, important, are, those, on, genesis, proverbs, daniel, the, psalms, romans, edited, in, 1522, against, his, will, by, luther, colossians, 1527, and, john, 1523, melanchthon, worked, with, luther, in, his, translation, of, the, bible, and, both, the, books, of, the, maccabees, in, luther, s, bible, are, ascribed, to, him, a, latin, bible, published, in, 1529, at, wittenberg, is, designated, as, a, joint, work, of, melanchthon, and, luther, melanchthon, s, influence, in, historical, theology, was, felt, until, the, seventeenth, century, especially, in, the, method, of, treating, church, history, in, connection, with, political, history, his, was, the, first, protestant, attempt, at, a, history, of, dogma, with, both, sententiae, veterum, aliquot, patrum, de, caena, domini, 1530, and, de, ecclesia, et, auctoritate, verbi, dei, 1539, melanchthon, exerted, a, wide, influence, in, homiletics, and, has, been, regarded, in, the, protestant, church, as, the, author, of, the, methodical, style, of, preaching, he, stayed, aloof, from, dogmatizing, or, rhetoric, in, the, annotationes, in, evangelia, 1544, the, conciones, in, evangelium, matthaei, 1558, and, in, his, german, sermons, prepared, for, george, of, anhalt, he, never, preached, from, the, pulpit, and, his, latin, sermons, postilla, were, prepared, for, the, hungarian, students, at, wittenberg, who, did, not, understand, german, in, 1548, he, published, the, history, of, the, life, and, acts, of, luther, in, this, book, he, includes, the, image, of, luther, nailing, the, 95, theses, to, the, door, of, castle, church, in, wittenberg, however, he, had, not, met, luther, at, this, time, and, luther, himself, never, mentioned, this, event, melanchthon, also, produced, the, first, protestant, work, on, the, method, of, theological, study, as, well, as, his, catechesis, puerilis, 1532, a, religious, manual, for, younger, students, and, a, german, catechism, 1549, as, a, philologist, and, pedagogue, melanchthon, was, the, spiritual, heir, of, the, south, german, humanists, such, as, reuchlin, jakob, wimpfeling, and, rodolphus, agricola, who, represented, an, ethical, conception, of, the, humanities, he, saw, the, liberal, arts, and, a, classical, education, as, paths, not, only, towards, natural, and, ethical, philosophy, but, also, towards, divine, philosophy, the, ancient, classics, were, seen, as, the, sources, of, a, purer, knowledge, and, also, the, best, means, of, educating, the, youth, both, by, their, beauty, of, form, and, by, their, ethical, content, by, his, activity, in, educational, institutions, and, his, compilations, of, latin, and, greek, grammars, and, commentaries, he, became, the, founder, of, the, learned, schools, of, evangelical, germany, using, a, combination, of, humanistic, and, christian, ideals, the, influence, of, his, philosophical, compendia, ended, only, with, the, rule, of, the, leibniz, wolff, school, he, came, to, wittenberg, with, the, plan, of, editing, the, complete, works, of, aristotle, and, he, edited, the, rhetoric, 1519, and, the, dialectic, 1520, he, believed, that, the, relation, of, philosophy, to, theology, is, characterized, by, the, distinction, between, law, and, gospel, the, former, as, a, light, of, nature, is, innate, it, also, contains, the, elements, of, the, natural, knowledge, of, god, which, however, have, been, obscured, and, weakened, by, sin, therefore, renewed, promulgation, of, the, law, by, revelation, became, necessary, and, was, furnished, in, the, decalogue, and, all, law, including, that, in, the, form, of, natural, philosophy, contains, only, demands, shadowings, its, fulfillment, is, given, only, in, the, gospel, the, object, of, certainty, in, theology, by, which, also, the, philosophical, elements, of, knowledge, experience, principles, of, reason, and, syllogism, receive, only, their, final, confirmation, as, the, law, is, a, divinely, ordered, pedagogue, that, leads, to, christ, philosophy, its, interpreter, is, subject, to, revealed, truth, as, the, principal, standard, of, opinions, and, life, he, published, de, dialecta, libri, iv, 1528, erotemata, dialectices, 1547, liber, de, anima, 1540, initia, doctrinae, physicae, 1549, and, ethicae, doctrinae, elementa, 1550, there, have, been, preserved, original, portraits, of, melanchthon, by, three, famous, painters, of, his, time, hans, holbein, the, younger, with, one, version, in, the, royal, gallery, of, hanover, albrecht, d, rer, and, lucas, cranach, the, elder, melanchthon, was, described, as, being, dwarfish, misshapen, and, physically, weak, although, he, is, said, to, have, had, a, bright, and, sparkling, eye, which, kept, its, colour, till, the, day, of, his, death, he, did, not, value, money, and, possessions, his, hospitality, was, often, misused, in, such, a, way, that, his, swabian, servant, sometimes, had, difficulty, in, managing, the, household, his, domestic, life, was, happy, he, called, his, home, a, little, church, of, god, always, found, peace, there, and, showed, a, tender, solicitude, for, his, wife, and, children, a, french, scholar, once, found, him, rocking, the, cradle, with, one, hand, and, holding, a, book, in, the, other, his, closest, friend, was, joachim, camerarius, whom, he, called, the, half, of, his, soul, his, extensive, correspondence, forms, a, commentary, on, his, life, he, wrote, speeches, and, scientific, treatises, for, others, permitting, them, to, use, their, own, signatures, he, acknowledged, his, faults, even, to, opponents, like, flacius, and, was, open, to, criticism, he, laid, great, stress, upon, prayer, daily, meditation, on, the, bible, and, attendance, of, public, service
