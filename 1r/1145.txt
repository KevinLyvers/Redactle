gediminas, latin, gedeminne, gedeminnus, c, 1275, december, 1341, was, grand, duke, of, lithuania, from, 1315, or, 1316, until, his, death, in, 1341, he, is, considered, the, founder, of, lithuania, s, capital, vilnius, see, iron, wolf, legend, during, his, reign, he, brought, under, his, rule, lands, from, the, baltic, sea, to, the, black, sea, the, gediminids, dynasty, he, founded, and, which, is, named, after, him, came, to, rule, over, poland, hungary, and, bohemia, gediminas, was, born, in, about, 1275, because, written, sources, of, the, era, are, scarce, gediminas, ancestry, early, life, and, assumption, of, the, title, of, grand, duke, in, ca, 1316, are, obscure, and, continue, to, be, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, various, theories, have, claimed, that, gediminas, was, either, his, predecessor, grand, duke, vytenis, son, his, brother, his, cousin, or, his, hostler, for, several, centuries, only, two, versions, of, his, origins, circulated, chronicles, written, long, after, gediminas, death, by, the, teutonic, knights, a, long, standing, enemy, of, lithuania, claimed, that, gediminas, was, a, hostler, to, vytenis, according, to, these, chronicles, gediminas, killed, his, master, and, assumed, the, throne, another, version, introduced, in, the, lithuanian, chronicles, which, also, appeared, long, after, gediminas, death, proclaimed, that, gediminas, was, vytenis, son, however, the, two, men, were, almost, the, same, age, making, this, relationship, unlikely, recent, research, indicates, that, gediminias, ancestor, may, have, been, skalmantas, in, 1974, historian, jerzy, ochma, ski, noted, that, zadonshchina, a, poem, from, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, contains, a, line, in, which, two, sons, of, algirdas, name, their, ancestors, we, are, two, brothers, sons, of, algirdas, and, grandsons, of, gediminas, and, great, grandsons, of, skalmantas, this, discovery, led, to, the, belief, that, skalmantas, was, the, long, sought, ancestor, of, the, gediminids, ochma, ski, posited, that, the, poem, skipped, the, generation, represented, by, butvydas, and, jumped, back, to, the, unknown, ancestor, baranauskas, disagrees, believing, skalmantas, was, butvydas, brother, rather, than, his, father, and, that, vytenis, and, gediminas, were, therefore, cousins, gediminas, became, the, grand, duke, in, 1316, at, the, age, of, 40, and, ruled, for, 25, years, gediminas, inherited, land, consisting, of, lithuania, proper, samogitia, navahrudak, podlasie, polotsk, and, minsk, however, these, possessions, were, all, threatened, by, the, teutonic, knights, and, the, livonian, order, which, desired, to, conquer, them, gediminas, allied, himself, with, the, tatars, against, the, teutonic, order, in, 1319, the, systematic, raiding, of, lithuania, by, the, knights, under, the, pretext, of, converting, it, had, long, since, united, all, the, lithuanian, tribes, for, this, purpose, he, entered, into, direct, diplomatic, negotiations, with, the, holy, see, at, the, end, of, 1322, he, sent, letters, to, pope, john, xxii, soliciting, his, protection, against, the, persecution, of, the, knights, informing, him, of, the, privileges, already, granted, to, the, dominicans, and, franciscans, in, lithuania, for, preaching, christianity, gediminas, also, asked, that, legates, should, be, dispatched, to, him, in, order, to, be, baptized, this, action, was, supported, by, the, archbishop, of, riga, frederic, lobestat, following, these, events, peace, between, the, duchy, and, the, livonian, order, was, eventually, conducted, on, 2, october, 1323, on, receiving, a, favourable, reply, from, the, holy, see, gediminas, issued, circular, letters, dated, 25, january, 1323, to, the, principal, hanseatic, towns, offering, a, free, access, into, his, domains, to, men, of, every, order, and, profession, from, nobles, and, knights, to, tillers, of, the, soil, the, immigrants, were, to, choose, their, own, settlements, and, be, governed, by, their, own, laws, priests, and, monks, were, also, invited, to, come, and, build, churches, at, vilnius, and, navahrudak, in, october, 1323, representatives, of, the, archbishop, of, riga, the, bishop, of, dorpat, the, king, of, denmark, the, dominican, and, franciscan, orders, and, the, grand, master, of, the, teutonic, order, assembled, at, vilnius, when, gediminas, confirmed, his, promises, and, undertook, to, be, baptised, as, soon, as, the, papal, legates, arrived, a, compact, was, then, signed, at, vilnius, in, the, name, of, the, whole, christian, world, between, gediminas, and, the, delegates, confirming, the, promised, privileges, on, his, raid, upon, dobrzy, the, latest, acquisition, of, the, knights, on, polish, soil, gave, them, a, ready, weapon, against, him, the, prussian, bishops, who, were, devoted, to, the, knights, questioned, the, authority, of, gediminas, letters, and, denounced, him, as, an, enemy, of, the, faith, at, a, synod, in, elbing, his, orthodox, subjects, reproached, him, with, leaning, towards, the, latin, heresy, while, the, pagan, lithuanians, accused, him, of, abandoning, the, ancient, gods, gediminas, disentangled, himself, from, his, difficulties, by, repudiating, his, former, promises, by, refusing, to, receive, the, papal, legates, who, arrived, at, riga, in, september, 1323, and, by, dismissing, the, franciscans, from, his, territories, this, led, gediminas, to, maintain, paganism, in, lithuania, even, if, more, than, twice, as, many, orthodox, christians, lived, in, his, realm, than, pagans, at, the, same, time, gediminas, privately, informed, the, papal, legates, at, riga, through, his, ambassadors, that, his, difficult, position, compelled, him, to, postpone, his, steadfast, resolve, of, being, baptised, and, the, legates, showed, their, confidence, in, him, by, forbidding, the, neighbouring, states, to, war, against, lithuania, for, the, next, four, years, besides, ratifying, the, treaty, made, between, gediminas, and, the, archbishop, of, riga, nevertheless, disregarding, the, censures, of, the, church, the, order, resumed, the, war, with, gediminas, by, murdering, one, of, his, delegates, sent, to, welcome, the, grand, master, for, his, arrival, to, riga, in, 1325, he, had, in, the, meantime, improved, his, position, by, an, alliance, with, wladislaus, lokietek, king, of, poland, and, had, his, daughter, aldona, baptized, for, the, sake, of, betrothing, her, to, w, adys, aw, s, son, casimir, iii, baptizing, himself, would, have, implications, for, gediminas, domestically, it, would, have, offended, the, staunchly, pagan, inhabitants, of, the, major, lithuanian, regions, of, emaitija, and, auk, taitija, in, addition, these, heartland, pagans, together, with, the, orthodox, rus, threatened, gediminas, with, death, if, he, decided, to, convert, a, similar, scenario, also, happened, to, mindaugas, which, he, desperately, wanted, to, avoid, his, strategy, was, to, gain, the, support, of, the, pope, and, other, catholic, powers, in, his, conflict, with, the, teutonic, order, by, granting, a, favourable, status, to, catholics, living, within, his, realm, and, feigning, a, personal, interest, in, the, christian, religion, while, he, allowed, catholic, clergy, to, enter, his, realm, for, the, purpose, of, ministering, to, his, catholic, subjects, and, to, temporary, residents, he, savagely, punished, any, attempt, to, convert, pagan, lithuanians, or, to, insult, their, native, religion, thus, in, about, 1339, 1340, he, executed, two, franciscan, friars, from, bohemia, ulrich, and, martin, who, had, gone, beyond, the, authority, granted, them, and, had, publicly, preached, against, the, lithuanian, religion, gediminas, ordered, them, to, renounce, christianity, and, had, them, killed, when, they, refused, five, more, friars, were, executed, in, 1369, for, the, same, offence, despite, gediminas, chief, goal, to, save, lithuania, from, german, attacks, he, still, died, as, a, pagan, reigning, over, semi, pagan, lands, also, he, was, equally, bound, to, his, pagan, kinsmen, in, samogitia, to, his, orthodox, subjects, in, belarus, and, to, his, catholic, allies, in, masovia, therefore, it, is, still, unclear, whether, the, letters, sent, to, the, pope, were, an, actual, request, for, conversion, or, simply, a, diplomatic, maneuver, nevertheless, gediminas, began, a, new, baptism, campaign, in, 1340, 41, to, prevent, the, teutonic, knights, aggression, in, addition, from, promoting, paganism, the, jewish, community, of, lithuania, prospered, during, his, reign, gediminas, by, the, grace, of, god, the, king, of, lithuanians, and, ruthenians, the, ruler, and, duke, of, semigallia, gediminas, s, titles, mentioned, in, his, 26, may, 1323, letter, which, was, sent, to, the, germanian, cities, while, on, his, guard, against, his, northern, foes, gediminas, from, 1316, to, 1340, was, aggrandizing, himself, at, the, expense, of, the, numerous, ruthenian, principalities, in, the, south, and, east, gediminas, conquered, a, long, series, of, cities, across, belarus, and, northern, ukraine, as, well, but, the, various, stages, of, these, battles, are, impossible, to, follow, especially, from, 1325, to, 1340, sources, about, eastern, campaigns, being, few, and, conflicting, and, the, date, of, every, salient, event, exceedingly, doubtful, one, of, his, most, important, territorial, accretions, the, principality, of, halych, volynia, was, obtained, by, the, marriage, of, his, son, lubart, with, the, daughter, of, the, galician, prince, from, about, 23, km, 14, mi, south, west, of, kiev, gediminas, defeated, stanislav, of, kiev, and, his, allies, in, the, battle, on, the, irpin, river, he, then, besieged, and, conquered, kiev, sending, stanislav, the, last, descendant, of, the, rurik, dynasty, to, ever, rule, kiev, into, exile, first, in, bryansk, and, then, in, ryazan, theodor, brother, of, gediminas, and, algimantas, son, of, mindaugas, from, the, olshanski, family, were, installed, in, kiev, after, these, conquests, lithuania, stretched, very, close, to, the, black, sea, while, exploiting, ruthenian, weakness, in, the, wake, of, the, mongol, invasion, gediminas, avoided, war, with, the, golden, horde, a, great, regional, power, at, the, time, while, expanding, lithuania, s, border, almost, towards, the, black, sea, he, also, secured, an, alliance, with, the, nascent, grand, duchy, of, moscow, by, marrying, his, daughter, anastasia, to, the, grand, duke, simeon, however, gediminas, offsetted, the, influence, of, muscovy, in, northern, russia, and, assisted, the, republic, of, pskov, which, acknowledged, his, overlordship, to, break, away, from, great, novgorod, gediminas, was, known, for, protecting, catholics, and, orthodox, people, in, addition, to, pagans, and, he, is, known, for, improving, the, efficiency, of, the, lithuanian, army, also, he, is, known, for, building, a, chain, of, fortresses, as, well, as, numerous, castles, in, towns, including, vilnius, at, first, he, moved, the, capital, to, the, newly, built, town, of, trakai, but, in, c, 1320, re, established, a, permanent, capital, in, vilnius, gediminas, died, in, 1341, presumably, killed, during, a, coup, d, tat, he, was, cremated, as, a, part, of, a, pagan, ceremony, in, 1342, which, included, a, human, sacrifice, with, his, favourite, servant, and, several, german, slaves, being, burned, on, the, pyre, with, the, corpse, he, was, succeeded, by, one, of, his, sons, jaunutis, who, was, unable, to, control, the, unrest, in, the, country, as, a, result, of, which, he, was, deposed, in, 1345, by, his, brother, algirdas, he, was, a, founder, of, a, new, lithuanian, dynasty, the, gediminids, and, laid, the, foundations, of, the, state, s, expansion, while, sometimes, referred, as, the, true, state, founder, in, 1862, the, millennium, of, russia, monument, was, unveiled, in, veliky, novgorod, with, a, sculpture, for, him, on, base, in, modern, historiography, he, is, also, regarded, as, founder, of, vilnius, the, modern, capital, of, lithuania, according, to, a, legend, possibly, set, in, 1322, while, he, was, on, a, hunting, trip, he, dreamt, of, an, iron, clad, wolf, who, stood, on, a, hill, howling, in, an, odd, manner, as, if, thousand, of, wolves, would, be, howling, at, once, he, consulted, his, vision, with, his, priest, lizdeika, who, told, him, the, dream, spoke, of, a, city, that, must, be, built, at, the, exact, place, and, decided, to, build, a, fortification, on, the, confluence, of, rivers, vilnia, and, neris, where, the, place, of, his, vision, was, pointed, out, this, event, inspired, the, romantic, movement, particularly, adam, mickiewicz, who, gave, the, story, a, poetic, form, gediminas, is, depicted, on, a, silver, litas, commemorative, coin, issued, in, 1996, the, lithuanian, folk, music, group, k, lgrinda, released, an, album, in, 2009, titled, giesm, s, valdovui, gediminui, meaning, hymns, to, ruler, gediminas, gediminas, as, hiedymin, or, gedymin, is, also, widely, celebrated, in, belarus, as, an, important, figure, of, national, history, in, september, 2019, a, monument, to, gediminas, was, unveiled, in, lida, gediminas, normal, latin, style, is, as, follows, which, translates, as, in, his, letters, to, the, papacy, in, 1322, and, 1323, he, adds, princeps, et, dux, semigalliae, prince, and, duke, of, semigallia, in, contemporary, low, german, he, is, styled, simply, koningh, van, lettowen, mirroring, the, latin, rex, lethowyae, both, meaning, king, of, lithuania, gediminas, right, to, use, the, latin, rex, which, the, papacy, had, been, claiming, the, right, to, grant, from, the, 13th, century, onwards, was, not, universally, recognized, in, catholic, sources, thus, he, was, called, rex, sive, dux, king, or, duke, in, one, source, pope, john, xxii, in, a, letter, to, the, king, of, france, referred, to, gediminas, as, the, one, who, calls, himself, rex, however, the, pope, did, call, gediminas, rex, when, addressing, him, regem, sive, ducem,

a, twelve, corners, edging, at, the, middle, of, the, edging, was, an, image, of, a, man, with, long, hairs, who, sat, on, a, throne, and, held, a, crown, or, a, wreath, in, his, right, hand, and, a,

the, grace, of, god, the, king, of, the, lithuanians, and, the, rus, people, seal, the, cross, usage, in, a, pagan, ruler, s, seal, is, explained, as, a, diplomatic, action, because, gediminas, did, not, accept, baptism, in, his, life, and, kept, lithuania, pagan, despite, several, negotiations, in, addition, gediminas, strictly, distinguished, lithuania, and, lithuanians, from, the, region, of, rus, ruthenia, and, rus, people, ruthenians, in, legal, documents, e, g, in, a, 1338, peace, and, trade, agreement, concluded, in, vilnius, between, the, grand, duke, gediminas, and, his, sons, and, the, master, of, the, livonian, order, everhard, von, monheim, in, 1337, a, lithuanian, banner, is, mentioned, for, the, first, time, in, wigand, of, marburg, s, chronicles, who, wrote, that, during, the, battle, at, bayernburg, castle, near, veliuona, lithuania, tilman, zumpach, head, of, the, teutonic, riflemen, burned, the, lithuanian, banner, with, a, flaming, lance, and, then, mortally, wounded, the, king, of, trakai, however, he, didn, t, describe, its, appearance, it, is, uncertain, how, many, wives, gediminas, had, the, bychowiec, chronicle, mentions, three, wives, vida, from, courland, olga, from, smolensk, and, jaun, from, polotsk, who, was, eastern, orthodox, and, died, in, 1344, or, 1345, most, modern, historians, and, reference, works, say, gediminas, wife, was, jewna, dismissing, vida, and, olga, as, fictitious, since, no, sources, other, than, this, chronicle, mention, the, other, two, wives, some, arguments, state, that, gediminas, had, two, wives, one, pagan, and, another, orthodox, this, case, is, supported, only, by, the, j, ngere, hochmeisterchronik, a, late, 15th, century, chronicle, mentioning, narimantas, as, half, brother, to, algirdas, other, historians, support, this, claim, by, arguing, this, would, explain, gediminas, otherwise, mysterious, designation, of, a, middle, son, jaunutis, as, his, succession, would, be, understandable, if, jaunutis, were, the, first, born, son, of, gediminas, and, a, second, wife, he, is, said, to, have, left, seven, sons, and, six, daughters, including
