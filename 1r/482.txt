famous, solo, piano, compositions, mendelssohn, s, grandfather, was, the, renowned, jewish, philosopher, moses, mendelssohn, but, felix, was, initially, raised, without, religion, until, he, was, baptised, aged, seven, into, the, reformed, christian, church, he, was, recognised, early, as, a, musical, prodigy, but, his, parents, were, cautious, and, did, not, seek, to, capitalise, on, his, talent, his, sister, fanny, mendelssohn, received, a, similar, musical, education, and, was, a, talented, composer, and, pianist, in, her, own, right, some, of, her, early, songs, were, published, under, her, brother, s, name, and, her, easter, sonata, was, for, a, time, mistakenly, attributed, to, him, after, being, lost, and, rediscovered, in, the, 1970s, mendelssohn, enjoyed, early, success, in, germany, and, revived, interest, in, the, music, of, johann, sebastian, bach, notably, with, his, performance, of, the, st, matthew, passion, in, 1829, he, became, well, received, in, his, travels, throughout, europe, as, a, composer, conductor, and, soloist, his, ten, visits, to, britain, during, which, many, of, his, major, works, were, premiered, form, an, important, part, of, his, adult, career, his, essentially, conservative, musical, tastes, set, him, apart, from, more, adventurous, musical, contemporaries, such, as, franz, liszt, richard, wagner, charles, valentin, alkan, and, hector, berlioz, the, leipzig, conservatory, which, he, founded, became, a, bastion, of, this, anti, radical, outlook, after, a, long, period, of, relative, denigration, due, to, changing, musical, tastes, and, antisemitism, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, his, creative, originality, has, been, re, evaluated, he, is, now, among, the, most, popular, composers, of, the, romantic, era, felix, mendelssohn, was, born, on, 3, february, 1809, in, hamburg, at, the, time, an, independent, city, state, in, the, same, house, where, a, year, later, the, dedicatee, and, first, performer, of, his, violin, concerto, ferdinand, david, would, be, born, mendelssohn, s, father, the, banker, abraham, mendelssohn, was, the, son, of, the, german, jewish, philosopher, moses, mendelssohn, whose, family, was, prominent, in, the, german, jewish, community, until, his, baptism, at, age, seven, mendelssohn, was, brought, up, largely, without, religion, his, mother, lea, salomon, was, a, member, of, the, itzig, family, and, a, sister, of, jakob, salomon, bartholdy, mendelssohn, was, the, second, of, four, children, his, older, sister, fanny, also, displayed, exceptional, and, precocious, musical, talent, the, family, moved, to, berlin, in, 1811, leaving, hamburg, in, disguise, in, fear, of, french, reprisal, for, the, mendelssohn, bank, s, role, in, breaking, napoleon, s, continental, system, blockade, abraham, and, lea, mendelssohn, sought, to, give, their, children, fanny, felix, paul, and, rebecka, the, best, education, possible, fanny, became, a, pianist, well, known, in, berlin, musical, circles, as, a, composer, originally, abraham, had, thought, that, she, rather, than, felix, would, be, the, more, musical, but, it, was, not, considered, proper, by, either, abraham, or, felix, for, a, woman, to, pursue, a, career, in, music, so, she, remained, an, active, but, non, professional, musician, abraham, was, initially, disinclined, to, allow, felix, to, follow, a, musical, career, until, it, became, clear, that, he, was, seriously, dedicated, mendelssohn, grew, up, in, an, intellectual, environment, frequent, visitors, to, the, salon, organised, by, his, parents, at, their, home, in, berlin, included, artists, musicians, and, scientists, among, them, wilhelm, and, alexander, von, humboldt, and, the, mathematician, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, whom, mendelssohn, s, sister, rebecka, would, later, marry, the, musician, sarah, rothenburg, has, written, of, the, household, that, europe, came, to, their, living, room, abraham, mendelssohn, renounced, the, jewish, religion, prior, to, felix, s, birth, and, he, and, his, wife, decided, against, having, felix, circumcised, felix, and, his, siblings, were, at, first, brought, up, without, religious, education, on, 21, march, 1816, they, were, baptized, in, a, private, ceremony, in, the, family, s, berlin, apartment, by, the, reformed, protestant, minister, of, the, jerusalem, church, at, which, time, felix, was, given, the, additional, names, jakob, ludwig, abraham, and, his, wife, lea, were, baptised, in, 1822, and, formally, adopted, the, surname, mendelssohn, bartholdy, which, they, had, used, since, 1812, for, themselves, and, for, their, children, the, name, bartholdy, was, added, at, the, suggestion, of, lea, s, brother, jakob, salomon, bartholdy, who, had, inherited, a, property, of, this, name, in, luisenstadt, and, adopted, it, as, his, own, surname, in, an, 1829, letter, to, felix, abraham, explained, that, adopting, the, bartholdy, name, was, meant, to, demonstrate, a, decisive, break, with, the, traditions, of, his, father, moses, there, can, no, more, be, a, christian, mendelssohn, than, there, can, be, a, jewish, confucius, letter, to, felix, of, 8, july, 1829, on, embarking, on, his, musical, career, felix, did, not, entirely, drop, the, name, mendelssohn, as, abraham, had, requested, but, in, deference, to, his, father, signed, his, letters, and, had, his, visiting, cards, printed, using, the, form, mendelssohn, bartholdy, in, 1829, his, sister, fanny, wrote, to, him, of, bartholdy, this, name, that, we, all, dislike, mendelssohn, began, taking, piano, lessons, from, his, mother, when, he, was, six, and, at, seven, was, tutored, by, marie, bigot, in, paris, later, in, berlin, all, four, mendelssohn, children, studied, piano, with, ludwig, berger, who, was, himself, a, former, student, of, muzio, clementi, from, at, least, may, 1819, mendelssohn, initially, with, his, sister, fanny, studied, counterpoint, and, composition, with, carl, friedrich, zelter, in, berlin, this, was, an, important, influence, on, his, future, career, zelter, had, almost, certainly, been, recommended, as, a, teacher, by, his, aunt, sarah, levy, who, had, been, a, pupil, of, w, f, bach, and, a, patron, of, c, p, e, bach, sarah, levy, displayed, some, talent, as, a, keyboard, player, and, often, played, with, zelter, s, orchestra, at, the, berliner, singakademie, she, and, the, mendelssohn, family, were, among, its, leading, patrons, sarah, had, formed, an, important, collection, of, bach, family, manuscripts, which, she, bequeathed, to, the, singakademie, zelter, whose, tastes, in, music, were, conservative, was, also, an, admirer, of, the, bach, tradition, this, undoubtedly, played, a, significant, part, in, forming, felix, mendelssohn, s, musical, tastes, as, his, works, reflect, this, study, of, baroque, and, early, classical, music, his, fugues, and, chorales, especially, reflect, a, tonal, clarity, and, use, of, counterpoint, reminiscent, of, johann, sebastian, bach, whose, music, influenced, him, deeply, mendelssohn, probably, made, his, first, public, concert, appearance, at, the, age, of, nine, when, he, participated, in, a, chamber, music, concert, accompanying, a, horn, duo, he, was, a, prolific, composer, from, an, early, age, as, an, adolescent, his, works, were, often, performed, at, home, with, a, private, orchestra, for, the, associates, of, his, wealthy, parents, amongst, the, intellectual, elite, of, berlin, between, the, ages, of, 12, and, 14, mendelssohn, wrote, 13, string, symphonies, for, such, concerts, and, a, number, of, chamber, works, his, first, work, a, piano, quartet, was, published, when, he, was, 13, it, was, probably, abraham, mendelssohn, who, procured, the, publication, of, this, quartet, by, the, house, of, schlesinger, in, 1824, the, 15, year, old, wrote, his, first, symphony, for, full, orchestra, in, c, minor, op, 11, at, age, 16, mendelssohn, wrote, his, string, octet, in, e, flat, major, a, work, which, has, been, regarded, as, mark, the, beginning, of, his, maturity, as, a, composer, this, octet, and, his, overture, to, shakespeare, s, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, which, he, wrote, a, year, later, in, 1826, are, the, best, known, of, his, early, works, later, in, 1843, he, also, wrote, incidental, music, for, the, play, including, the, famous, wedding, march, the, overture, is, perhaps, the, earliest, example, of, a, concert, overture, that, is, a, piece, not, written, deliberately, to, accompany, a, staged, performance, but, to, evoke, a, literary, theme, in, performance, on, a, concert, platform, this, was, a, genre, which, became, a, popular, form, in, musical, romanticism, in, 1824, mendelssohn, studied, under, the, composer, and, piano, virtuoso, ignaz, moscheles, who, confessed, in, his, diaries, that, he, had, little, to, teach, him, moscheles, and, mendelssohn, became, close, colleagues, and, lifelong, friends, the, year, 1827, saw, the, premiere, and, sole, performance, in, his, lifetime, of, mendelssohn, s, opera, die, hochzeit, des, camacho, the, failure, of, this, production, left, him, disinclined, to, venture, into, the, genre, again, besides, music, mendelssohn, s, education, included, art, literature, languages, and, philosophy, he, had, a, particular, interest, in, classical, literature, and, translated, terence, s, andria, for, his, tutor, heyse, in, 1825, heyse, was, impressed, and, had, it, published, in, 1826, as, a, work, of, his, pupil, f, this, translation, also, qualified, mendelssohn, to, study, at, the, university, of, berlin, where, from, 1826, to, 1829, he, attended, lectures, on, aesthetics, by, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, on, history, by, eduard, gans, and, on, geography, by, carl, ritter, in, 1821, zelter, introduced, mendelssohn, to, his, friend, and, correspondent, the, writer, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, then, in, his, seventies, who, was, greatly, impressed, by, the, child, leading, to, perhaps, the, earliest, confirmed, comparison, with, mozart, in, the, following, conversation, between, goethe, and, zelter, musical, prodigies, are, probably, no, longer, so, rare, but, what, this, little, man, can, do, in, extemporizing, and, playing, at, sight, borders, the, miraculous, and, i, could, not, have, believed, it, possible, at, so, early, an, age, and, yet, you, heard, mozart, in, his, seventh, year, at, frankfurt, said, zelter, yes, answered, goethe, but, what, your, pupil, already, accomplishes, bears, the, same, relation, to, the, mozart, of, that, time, that, the, cultivated, talk, of, a, grown, up, person, bears, to, the, prattle, of, a, child, mendelssohn, was, invited, to, meet, goethe, on, several, later, occasions, and, set, a, number, of, goethe, s, poems, to, music, his, other, compositions, inspired, by, goethe, include, the, overture, calm, sea, and, prosperous, voyage, op, 27, 1828, and, the, cantata, die, erste, walpurgisnacht, the, first, walpurgis, night, op, 60, 1832, in, 1829, with, the, backing, of, zelter, and, the, assistance, of, the, actor, eduard, devrient, mendelssohn, arranged, and, conducted, a, performance, in, berlin, of, bach, s, st, matthew, passion, four, years, previously, his, grandmother, bella, salomon, had, given, him, a, copy, of, the, manuscript, of, this, by, then, all, but, forgotten, masterpiece, the, orchestra, and, choir, for, the, performance, were, provided, by, the, berlin, singakademie, the, success, of, this, performance, one, of, the, very, few, since, bach, s, death, and, the, first, ever, outside, of, leipzig, was, the, central, event, in, the, revival, of, bach, s, music, in, germany, and, eventually, throughout, europe, it, earned, mendelssohn, widespread, acclaim, at, the, age, of, 20, it, also, led, to, one, of, the, few, explicit, references, which, mendelssohn, made, to, his, origins, to, think, that, it, took, an, actor, and, a, jew, s, son, to, revive, the, greatest, christian, music, for, the, world, over, the, next, few, years, mendelssohn, travelled, widely, his, first, visit, to, england, was, in, 1829, other, places, visited, during, the, 1830s, included, vienna, florence, milan, rome, and, naples, in, all, of, which, he, met, with, local, and, visiting, musicians, and, artists, these, years, proved, to, be, the, germination, for, some, of, his, most, famous, works, including, the, hebrides, overture, and, the, scottish, and, italian, symphonies, on, zelter, s, death, in, 1832, mendelssohn, had, hopes, of, succeeding, him, as, conductor, of, the, singakademie, but, at, a, vote, in, january, 1833, he, was, defeated, for, the, post, by, carl, friedrich, rungenhagen, this, may, have, been, because, of, mendelssohn, s, youth, and, fear, of, possible, innovations, it, was, also, suspected, by, some, to, be, attributable, to, his, jewish, ancestry, following, this, rebuff, mendelssohn, divided, most, of, his, professional, time, over, the, next, few, years, between, britain, and, d, sseldorf, where, he, was, appointed, musical, director, his, first, paid, post, as, a, musician, in, 1833, in, the, spring, of, that, year, mendelssohn, directed, the, lower, rhenish, music, festival, in, d, sseldorf, beginning, with, a, performance, of, george, frideric, handel, s, oratorio, israel, in, egypt, prepared, from, the, original, score, which, he, had, found, in, london, this, precipitated, a, handel, revival, in, germany, similar, to, the, reawakened, interest, in, j, s, bach, following, his, performance, of, the, st, matthew, passion, mendelssohn, worked, with, the, dramatist, karl, immermann, to, improve, local, theatre, standards, and, made, his, first, appearance, as, an, opera, conductor, in, immermann, s, production, of, mozart, s, don, giovanni, at, the, end, of, 1833, where, he, took, umbrage, at, the, audience, s, protests, about, the, cost, of, tickets, his, frustration, at, his, everyday, duties, in, d, sseldorf, and, the, city, s, provincialism, led, him, to, resign, his, position, at, the, end, of, 1834, he, had, offers, from, both, munich, and, leipzig, for, important, musical, posts, namely, direction, of, the, munich, opera, the, editorship, of, the, prestigious, leipzig, music, journal, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, and, direction, of, the, leipzig, gewandhaus, orchestra, he, accepted, the, latter, in, 1835, in, leipzig, mendelssohn, concentrated, on, developing, the, town, s, musical, life, by, working, with, the, orchestra, the, opera, house, the, thomanerchor, of, which, bach, had, been, a, director, and, the, city, s, other, choral, and, musical, institutions, mendelssohn, s, concerts, included, in, addition, to, many, of, his, own, works, three, series, of, historical, concerts, featuring, music, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, a, number, of, works, by, his, contemporaries, he, was, deluged, by, offers, of, music, from, rising, and, would, be, composers, among, these, was, richard, wagner, who, submitted, his, early, symphony, the, score, of, which, to, wagner, s, disgust, mendelssohn, lost, or, mislaid, mendelssohn, also, revived, interest, in, the, music, of, franz, schubert, robert, schumann, discovered, the, manuscript, of, schubert, s, ninth, symphony, and, sent, it, to, mendelssohn, who, promptly, premiered, it, in, leipzig, on, 21, march, 1839, more, than, a, decade, after, schubert, s, death, a, landmark, event, during, mendelssohn, s, leipzig, years, was, the, premiere, of, his, oratorio, paulus, the, english, version, of, this, is, known, as, st, paul, given, at, the, lower, rhenish, festival, in, d, sseldorf, in, 1836, shortly, after, the, death, of, the, composer, s, father, which, affected, him, greatly, felix, wrote, that, he, would, never, cease, to, endeavour, to, gain, his, approval, although, i, can, no, longer, enjoy, it, st, paul, seemed, to, many, of, mendelssohn, s, contemporaries, to, be, his, finest, work, and, sealed, his, european, reputation, when, friedrich, wilhelm, iv, came, to, the, prussian, throne, in, 1840, with, ambitions, to, develop, berlin, as, a, cultural, centre, including, the, establishment, of, a, music, school, and, reform, of, music, for, the, church, the, obvious, choice, to, head, these, reforms, was, mendelssohn, he, was, reluctant, to, undertake, the, task, especially, in, the, light, of, his, existing, strong, position, in, leipzig, mendelssohn, nonetheless, spent, some, time, in, berlin, writing, some, church, music, such, as, die, deutsche, liturgie, and, at, the, king, s, request, music, for, productions, of, sophocles, s, antigone, 1841, an, overture, and, seven, pieces, and, oedipus, at, colonus, 1845, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, 1843, and, racine, s, athalie, 1845, but, the, funds, for, the, school, never, materialised, and, many, of, the, court, s, promises, to, mendelssohn, regarding, finances, title, and, concert, programming, were, broken, he, was, therefore, not, displeased, to, have, the, excuse, to, return, to, leipzig, in, 1843, mendelssohn, founded, a, major, music, school, the, leipzig, conservatory, now, the, hochschule, f, r, musik, und, theater, felix, mendelssohn, bartholdy, where, he, persuaded, ignaz, moscheles, and, robert, schumann, to, join, him, other, prominent, musicians, including, the, string, players, ferdinand, david, and, joseph, joachim, and, the, music, theorist, moritz, hauptmann, also, became, staff, members, after, mendelssohn, s, death, in, 1847, his, musically, conservative, tradition, was, carried, on, when, moscheles, succeeded, him, as, head, of, the, conservatory, mendelssohn, first, visited, britain, in, 1829, where, moscheles, who, had, already, settled, in, london, introduced, him, to, influential, musical, circles, in, the, summer, he, visited, edinburgh, where, he, met, among, others, the, composer, john, thomson, whom, he, later, recommended, for, the, post, of, professor, of, music, at, edinburgh, university, he, made, ten, visits, to, britain, lasting, altogether, about, 20, months, he, won, a, strong, following, which, enabled, him, to, make, a, good, impression, on, british, musical, life, he, composed, and, performed, and, also, edited, for, british, publishers, the, first, critical, editions, of, oratorios, of, handel, and, of, the, organ, music, of, j, s, bach, scotland, inspired, two, of, his, most, famous, works, the, overture, the, hebrides, also, known, as, fingal, s, cave, and, the, scottish, symphony, symphony, no, 3, an, english, heritage, blue, plaque, commemorating, mendelssohn, s,

mendelssohn, during, this, period, both, in, london, and, leipzig, he, first, heard, bennett, perform, in, london, in, 1833, aged, 17, bennett, appeared, with, mendelssohn, in, concerts, in, leipzig, throughout, the, 1836, 1837, season, on, mendelssohn, s, eighth, british, visit, in, the, summer, of, 1844, he, conducted, five, of, the, philharmonic, concerts, in, london, and, wrote, ever, before, was, anything, like, this, season, we, never, went, to, bed, before, half, past, one, every, hour, of, every, day, was, filled, with, engagements, three, weeks, beforehand, and, i, got, through, more, music, in, two, months, than, in, all, the, rest, of, the, year, letter, to, rebecka, mendelssohn, bartholdy, soden, 22, july, 1844, on, subsequent, visits, mendelssohn, met, queen, victoria, and, her, husband, prince, albert, himself, a, composer, who, both, greatly, admired, his, music, mendelssohn, s, oratorio, elijah, was, commissioned, by, the, birmingham, triennial, music, festival, and, premiered, on, 26, august, 1846, at, the, town, hall, birmingham, it, was, composed, to, a, german, text, translated, into, english, by, william, bartholomew, who, authored, and, translated, many, of,

by, nervous, problems, and, overwork, a, final, tour, of, england, left, him, exhausted, and, ill, and, the, death, of, his, sister, fanny, on, 14, may, 1847, caused, him, further, distress, less, than, six, months, later, on, 4, november, aged, 38, mendelssohn, died, in, leipzig, after, a, series, of, strokes, his, grandfather, moses, fanny, and, both, his, parents, had, all, died, from, similar, apoplexies, although, he, had, been, generally, meticulous, in, the, management, of, his, affairs, he, died, intestate, mendelssohn, s, funeral, was, held, at, the, paulinerkirche, leipzig, and, he, was, buried, at, the, dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof, i, in, berlin, kreuzberg, the, pallbearers, included, moscheles, schumann, and, niels, gade, mendelssohn, had, once, described, death, in, a, letter, to, a, stranger, as, a, place, where, it, is, to, be, hoped, there, is, still, music, but, no, more, sorrow, or, partings, while, mendelssohn, was, often, presented, as, equable, happy, and, placid, in, temperament, particularly, in, the, detailed, family, memoirs, published, by, his, nephew, sebastian, hensel, after, the, composer, s, death, this, was, misleading, the, music, historian, r, larry, todd, notes, the, remarkable, process, of, idealization, of, mendelssohn, s, character, that, crystallized, in, the, memoirs, of, the, composer, s, circle, including, hensel, s, the, nickname, discontented, polish, count, was, given, to, mendelssohn, on, account, of, his, aloofness, and, he, referred, to, the, epithet, in, his, letters, he, was, frequently, given, to, fits, of, temper, which, occasionally, led, to, collapse, devrient, mentions, that, on, one, occasion, in, the, 1830s, when, his, wishes, had, been, crossed, his, excitement, was, increased, so, fearfully, that, when, the, family, was, assembled, he, began, to, talk, incoherently, in, english, the, stern, voice, of, his, father, at, last, checked, the, wild, torrent, of, words, they, took, him, to, bed, and, a, profound, sleep, of, twelve, hours, restored, him, to, his, normal, state, such, fits, may, be, related, to, his, early, death, mendelssohn, was, an, enthusiastic, visual, artist, who, worked, in, pencil, and, watercolour, a, skill, which, he, enjoyed, throughout, his, life, his, correspondence, indicates, that, he, could, write, with, considerable, wit, in, german, and, english, his, letters, were, sometimes, accompanied, by, humorous, sketches, and, cartoons, on, 21, march, 1816, at, the, age, of, seven, years, mendelssohn, was, baptised, with, his, brother, and, sisters, in, a, private, domestic, ceremony, by, johann, jakob, stegemann, minister, of, the, evangelical, congregation, of, berlin, s, jerusalem, church, and, new, church, although, mendelssohn, was, a, conforming, christian, as, a, member, of, the, reformed, church, he, was, both, conscious, and, proud, of, his, jewish, ancestry, and, notably, of, his, connection, with, his, grandfather, moses, mendelssohn, he, was, the, prime, mover, in, proposing, to, the, publisher, heinrich, brockhaus, a, complete, edition, of, moses, works, which, continued, with, the, support, of, his, uncle, joseph, mendelssohn, felix, was, notably, reluctant, either, in, his, letters, or, conversation, to, comment, on, his, innermost, beliefs, his, friend, devrient, wrote, that, deep, convictions, were, never, uttered, in, intercourse, with, the, world, only, in, rare, and, intimate, moments, did, they, ever, appear, and, then, only, in, the, slightest, and, most, humorous, allusions, thus, for, example, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, rebecka, mendelssohn, rebukes, her, complaint, about, an, unpleasant, relative, what, do, you, mean, by, saying, you, are, not, hostile, to, jews, i, hope, this, was, a, joke, it, is, really, sweet, of, you, that, you, do, not, despise, your, family, isn, t, it, some, modern, scholars, have, devoted, considerable, energy, to, demonstrate, either, that, mendelssohn, was, deeply, sympathetic, to, his, ancestors, jewish, beliefs, or, that, he, was, hostile, to, this, and, sincere, in, his, christian, beliefs, throughout, his, life, mendelssohn, was, wary, of, the, more, radical, musical, developments, undertaken, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, he, was, generally, on, friendly, if, sometimes, somewhat, cool, terms, with, hector, berlioz, franz, liszt, and, giacomo, meyerbeer, but, in, his, letters, expresses, his, frank, disapproval, of, their, works, for, example, writing, of, liszt, that, his, compositions, were, inferior, to, his, playing, and, only, calculated, for, virtuosos, of, berlioz, s, overture, les, francs, juges, he, orchestration, is, such, a, frightful, muddle, that, one, ought, to, wash, one, s, hands, after, handling, one, of, his, scores, and, of, meyerbeer, s, opera, robert, le, diable, i, consider, it, ignoble, calling, its, villain, bertram, a, poor, devil, when, his, friend, the, composer, ferdinand, hiller, suggested, in, conversation, to, mendelssohn, that, he, looked, rather, like, meyerbeer, they, were, actually, distant, cousins, both, descendants, of, rabbi, moses, isserles, mendelssohn, was, so, upset, that, he, immediately, went, to, get, a, haircut, to, differentiate, himself, in, particular, mendelssohn, seems, to, have, regarded, paris, and, its, music, with, the, greatest, of, suspicion, and, an, almost, puritanical, distaste, attempts, made, during, his, visit, there, to, interest, him, in, saint, simonianism, ended, in, embarrassing, scenes, it, is, significant, that, the, only, musician, with, whom, mendelssohn, remained, a, close, personal, friend, ignaz, moscheles, was, of, an, older, generation, and, equally, conservative, in, outlook, moscheles, preserved, this, conservative, attitude, at, the, leipzig, conservatory, until, his, own, death, in, 1870, mendelssohn, married, c, cile, charlotte, sophie, jeanrenaud, 10, october, 1817, 25, september, 1853, the, daughter, of, a, french, reformed, church, clergyman, on, 28, march, 1837, the, couple, had, five, children, carl, marie, paul, lili, and, felix, august, the, second, youngest, child, felix, august, contracted, measles, in, 1844, and, was, left, with, impaired, health, he, died, in, 1851, the, eldest, carl, mendelssohn, bartholdy, 7, february, 1838, 23, february, 1897, became, a, historian, and, professor, of, history, at, heidelberg, and, freiburg, universities, he, died, in, a, psychiatric, institution, in, freiburg, aged, 59, paul, mendelssohn, bartholdy, 1841, 1880, was, a, noted, chemist, and, pioneered, the, manufacture, of, aniline, dye, marie, married, victor, benecke, and, lived, in, london, lili, married, adolf, wach, later, professor, of, law, at, leipzig, university, the, family, papers, inherited, by, marie, s, and, lili, s, children, form, the, basis, of, the, extensive, collection, of, mendelssohn, manuscripts, including, the, so, called, green, books, of, his, correspondence, now, in, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, university, c, cile, mendelssohn, bartholdy, died, less, than, six, years, after, her, husband, on, 25, september, 1853, mendelssohn, became, close, to, the, swedish, soprano, jenny, lind, whom, he, met, in, october, 1844, papers, confirming, their, relationship, had, not, been, made, public, in, 2013, george, biddlecombe, confirmed, in, the, journal, of, the, royal, musical, association, that, the, committee, of, the, mendelssohn, scholarship, foundation, possesses, material, indicating, that, mendelssohn, wrote, passionate, love, letters, to, jenny, lind, entreating, her, to, join, him, in, an, adulterous, relationship, and, threatening, suicide, as, a, means, of, exerting, pressure, upon, her, and, that, these, letters, were, destroyed, on, being, discovered, after, her, death, mendelssohn, met, and, worked, with, lind, many, times, and, started, an, opera, lorelei, for, her, based, on, the, legend, of, the, lorelei, rhine, maidens, the, opera, was, unfinished, at, his, death, he, is, said, to, have, tailored, the, aria, hear, ye, israel, in, his, oratorio, elijah, to, lind, s, voice, although, she, did, not, sing, the, part, until, after, his, death, at, a, concert, in, december, 1848, in, 1847, mendelssohn, attended, a, london, performance, of, meyerbeer, s, robert, le, diable, an, opera, that, musically, he, despised, in, order, to, hear, lind, s, british, debut, in, the, role, of, alice, the, music, critic, henry, chorley, who, was, with, him, wrote, i, see, as, i, write, the, smile, with, which, mendelssohn, whose, enjoyment, of, mdlle, lind, s, talent, was, unlimited, turned, round, and, looked, at, me, as, if, a, load, of, anxiety, had, been, taken, off, his, mind, his, attachment, to, mdlle, lind, s, genius, as, a, singer, was, unbounded, as, was, his, desire, for, her, success, upon, mendelssohn, s, death, lind, wrote, the, only, person, who, brought, fulfillment, to, my, spirit, and, almost, as, soon, as, i, found, him, i, lost, him, again, in, 1849, she, established, the, mendelssohn, scholarship, foundation, which, makes, an, award, to, a, young, resident, british, composer, every, two, years, in, mendelssohn, s, memory, the, first, winner, of, the, scholarship, in, 1856, was, arthur, sullivan, then, aged, 14, in, 1869, lind, erected, a, plaque, in, mendelssohn, s, memory, at, his, birthplace, in, hamburg, something, of, mendelssohn, s, intense, attachment, to, his, personal, vision, of, music, is, conveyed, in, his, comments, to, a, correspondent, who, suggested, converting, some, of, the, songs, without, words, into, lieder, by, adding, texts, what, music, i, love, expresses, to, me, are, not, thoughts, that, are, too, indefinite, for, me, to, put, into, words, but, on, the, contrary, too, definite, schumann, wrote, of, mendelssohn, that, he, was, the, mozart, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, most, brilliant, musician, the, one, who, most, clearly, sees, through, the, contradictions, of, the, age, and, for, the, first, time, reconciles, them, this, appreciation, brings, to, the, fore, two, features, that, characterized, mendelssohn, s, compositions, and, his, compositional, process, first, that, his, inspiration, for, musical, style, was, rooted, in, his, technical, mastery, and, his, interpretation, of, the, style, of, previous, masters, although, he, certainly, recognized, and, developed, the, strains, of, early, romanticism, in, the, music, of, beethoven, and, weber, the, historian, james, garratt, writes, that, from, his, early, career, the, view, emerged, that, mendelssohn, s, engagement, with, early, music, was, a, defining, aspect, of, his, creativity, this, approach, was, recognized, by, mendelssohn, himself, who, wrote, that, in, his, meetings, with, goethe, he, gave, the, poet, historical, exhibitions, at, the, keyboard, every, morning, for, about, an, hour, i, have, to, play, a, variety, of, works, by, great, composers, in, chronological, order, and, must, explain, to, him, how, they, contributed, to, the, advance, of, music, secondly, it, highlights, that, mendelssohn, was, more, concerned, to, reinvigorate, the, musical, legacy, which, he, inherited, rather, than, to, replace, it, with, new, forms, and, styles, or, with, the, use, of, more, exotic, orchestration, in, these, ways, he, differed, significantly, from, many, of, his, contemporaries, in, the, early, romantic, period, such, as, wagner, berlioz, and, franz, liszt, whilst, mendelssohn, admired, liszt, s, virtuosity, at, the, keyboard, he, found, his, music, jejune, berlioz, said, of, mendelssohn, that, he, had, perhaps, studied, the, music, of, the, dead, too, closely, the, musicologist, greg, vitercik, considers, that, while, mendelssohn, s, music, only, rarely, aspires, to, provoke, the, stylistic, innovations, evident, from, his, earliest, works, solve, some, of, the, contradictions, between, classical, forms, and, the, sentiments, of, romanticism, the, expressiveness, of, romantic, music, presented, a, problem, in, adherence, to, sonata, form, the, final, recapitulation, section, of, a, movement, could, seem, in, the, context, of, romantic, style, a, bland, element, without, passion, or, soul, furthermore, it, could, be, seen, as, a, pedantic, delay, before, reaching, the, emotional, climax, of, a, movement, which, in, the, classical, tradition, had, tended, to, be, at, the, transition, from, the, development, section, of, the, movement, to, the, recapitulation, whereas, berlioz, and, other, modernists, sought, to, have, the, emotional, climax, at, the, end, of, a, movement, if, necessary, by, adding, an, extended, coda, to, follow, the, recapitulation, proper, mendelssohn, s, solution, to, this, problem, was, less, sensational, than, berlioz, s, approach, but, was, rooted, in, changing, the, structural, balance, of, the, formal, components, of, the, movement, thus, typically, in, a, mendelssohnian, movement, the, development, recapitulation, transition, might, not, be, strongly, marked, and, the, recapitulation, section, would, be, harmonically, or, melodically, varied, so, as, not, to, be, a, direct, copy, of, the, opening, exposition, section, this, allowed, a, logical, movement, towards, a, final, climax, vitercik, summarizes, the, effect, as, to, assimilate, the, dynamic, trajectory, of, external, form, to, the, logical, unfolding, of, the, story, of, the, theme, richard, taruskin, wrote, that, although, mendelssohn, produced, works, of, extraordinary, mastery, at, a, very, early, age, he, never, outgrew, his, precocious, youthful, style, he, remained, stylistically, conservative, feeling, no, need, to, attract, attention, with, a, display, of, revolutionary, novelty, throughout, his, short, career, he, remained, comfortably, faithful, to, the, musical, status, quo, that, is, the, classical, forms, as, they, were, already, thought, of, by, his, time, his, version, of, romanticism, already, evident, in, his, earliest, works, consisted, in, musical, pictorialism, of, a, fairly, conventional, objective, nature, though, exquisitely, wrought, the, young, mendelssohn, was, greatly, influenced, in, his, childhood, by, the, music, of, both, j, s, bach, and, c, p, e, bach, and, of, beethoven, joseph, haydn, and, mozart, traces, of, these, composers, can, be, seen, in, the, 13, early, string, symphonies, these, were, written, from, 1821, to, 1823, when, he, was, between, the, ages, of, 12, and, 14, principally, for, performance, in, the, mendelssohn, household, and, not, published, or, publicly, performed, until, long, after, his, death, his, first, published, works, were, his, three, piano, quartets, 1822, 1825, op, 1, in, c, minor, op, 2, in, f, minor, and, op, 3, in, b, minor, but, his, capacities, are, especially, revealed, in, a, group, of, works, of, his, early, maturity, the, string, octet, 1825, the, overture, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, 1826, which, in, its, finished, form, also, owes, much, to, the, influence, of, adolf, bernhard, marx, at, the, time, a, close, friend, of, mendelssohn, and, the, two, early, string, quartets, op, 12, 1829, and, op, 13, 1827, which, both, show, a, remarkable, grasp, of, the, techniques, and, ideas, of, beethoven, s, last, quartets, that, mendelssohn, had, been, closely, studying, these, four, works, show, an, intuitive, command, of, form, harmony, counterpoint, colour, and, compositional, technique, which, in, the, opinion, of, r, larry, todd, justifies, claims, frequently, made, that, mendelssohn, s, precocity, exceeded, even, that, of, mozart, in, its, intellectual, grasp, a, 2009, survey, by, the, bbc, of, 16, music, critics, opined, that, mendelssohn, was, the, greatest, composing, prodigy, in, the, history, of, western, classical, music, mendelssohn, s, mature, symphonies, are, numbered, approximately, in, the, order, of, publication, rather, than, the, order, in, which, they, were, composed, the, order, of, composition, is, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3, the, placement, of, no, 3, in, this, sequence, is, problematic, because, he, worked, on, it, for, over, a, decade, starting, the, sketches, soon, after, he, began, work, on, no, 5, but, completing, it, after, both, nos, 5, and, 4, the, symphony, no, 1, in, c, minor, for, full, orchestra, was, written, in, 1824, when, mendelssohn, was, aged, 15, this, work, is, experimental, showing, the, influences, of, beethoven, and, carl, maria, von, weber, mendelssohn, conducted, the, symphony, on, his, first, visit, to, london, in, 1829, with, the, orchestra, of, the, philharmonic, society, for, the, third, movement, he, substituted, an, orchestration, of, the, scherzo, from, his, octet, in, this, form, the, piece, was, a, success, and, laid, the, foundations, of, his, british, reputation, during, 1829, and, 1830, mendelssohn, wrote, his, symphony, no, 5, known, as, the, reformation, it, celebrated, the, 300th, anniversary, of, the, reformation, mendelssohn, remained, dissatisfied, with, the, work, and, did, not, allow, publication, of, the, score, mendelssohn, s, travels, in, italy, inspired, him, to, compose, the, symphony, no, 4, in, a, major, known, as, the, italian, symphony, he, conducted, the, premiere, in, 1833, but, did, not, allow, the, score, to, be, published, during, his, lifetime, as, he, continually, sought, to, rewrite, it, the, scottish, symphony, symphony, no, 3, in, a, minor, was, written, and, revised, intermittently, between, 1829, when, mendelssohn, noted, down, the, opening, theme, during, a, visit, to, holyrood, palace, and, 1842, when, it, was, given, its, premiere, in, leipzig, the, last, of, his, symphonies, to, be, premiered, in, public, this, piece, evokes, scotland, s, atmosphere, in, the, ethos, of, romanticism, but, does, not, employ, any, identified, scottish, folk, melodies, he, wrote, the, symphony, cantata, lobgesang, hymn, of, praise, in, b, flat, major, posthumously, named, symphony, no, 2, to, mark, the, celebrations, in, leipzig, of, the, supposed, 400th, anniversary, of, the, printing, press, by, johannes, gutenberg, the, first, performance, took, place, on, 25, june, 1840, mendelssohn, wrote, the, concert, overture, the, hebrides, fingal, s, cave, in, 1830, inspired, by, visits, to, scotland, around, the, end, of, the, 1820s, he, visited, fingal, s, cave, on, the, hebridean, isle, of, staffa, as, part, of, his, grand, tour, of, europe, and, was, so, impressed, that, he, scribbled, the, opening, theme, of, the, overture, on, the, spot, including, it, in, a, letter, he, wrote, home, the, same, evening, he, wrote, other, concert, overtures, notably, calm, sea, and, prosperous, voyage, meeresstille, und, gl, ckliche, fahrt, 1828, inspired, by, a, pair, of, poems, by, goethe, and, the, fair, melusine, die, sch, ne, melusine, 1830, a, contemporary, writer, considered, these, works, as, perhaps, the, most, beautiful, overtures, that, so, far, we, germans, possess, mendelssohn, also, wrote, in, 1839, an, overture, to, ruy, blas, commissioned, for, a, charity, performance, of, victor, hugo, s, drama, which, the, composer, hated, his, incidental, music, to, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, op, 61, including, the, well, known, wedding, march, was, written, in, 1843, seventeen, years, after, the, overture, the, violin, concerto, in, e, minor, op, 64, 1844, was, written, for, ferdinand, david, david, who, had, worked, closely, with, mendelssohn, during, the, piece, s, preparation, gave, the, premiere, of, the, concerto, on, his, guarneri, violin, joseph, joachim, called, it, one, of, the, four, great, violin, concertos, along, with, those, of, beethoven, brahms, and, bruch, mendelssohn, also, wrote, a, lesser, known, early, concerto, for, violin, and, strings, in, d, minor, 1822, four, piano, concertos, no, 0, in, a, minor, 1822, 1, in, g, minor, 1831, 2, in, d, minor, 1837, and, 3, in, e, minor, a, posthumously, published, fragment, from, 1844, two, concertos, for, two, pianos, and, orchestra, e, major, which, he, wrote, at, 14, and, a, flat, major, at, 15, and, another, double, concerto, for, violin, and, piano, 1823, in, addition, there, are, several, single, movement, works, for, soloist, and, orchestra, those, for, piano, are, the, rondo, brillante, of, 1834, the, capriccio, brillante, of, 1832, and, the, serenade, and, allegro, giocoso, of, 1838, he, also, wrote, two, concertinos, konzertst, cke, op, 113, and, 114, originally, for, clarinet, basset, horn, and,

his, larger, works, in, particular, his, string, quartet, no, 6, the, last, of, his, string, quartets, and, his, last, major, work, written, following, the, death, of, his, sister, fanny, is, in, the, opinion, of, the, historian, peter, mercer, taylor, exceptionally, powerful, and, eloquent, other, mature, works, include, two, string, quintets, sonatas, for, the, clarinet, cello, viola, and, violin, and, two, piano, trios, for, the, piano, trio, no, 1, in, d, minor, mendelssohn, uncharacteristically, took, the, advice, of, his, fellow, composer, ferdinand, hiller, and, rewrote, the, piano, part, in, a, more, romantic, schumannesque, style, considerably, heightening, its, effect, the, musicologist, glenn, stanley, observes, that, nlike, brahms, unlike, his, contemporaries, schumann, chopin, and, liszt, and, unlike, revered, past, masters, mendelssohn, did, not, regard, the, piano, as, a, preferred, medium, for, his, most, significant, artistic, statements, mendelssohn, s, songs, without, words, lieder, ohne, worte, eight, cycles, each, containing, six, lyric, pieces, two, published, posthumously, remain, his, most, famous, solo, piano, compositions, they, became, standard, parlour, recital, items, even, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, and, their, overwhelming, popularity, according, to, todd, has, itself, caused, many, critics, to, underrate, their, musical, value, as, example, charles, rosen, equivocally, commented, despite, noting, how, much, beautiful, music, they, contain, that, t, is, not, true, that, they, are, insipid, but, they, might, as, well, be, during, the, 19th, century, composers, who, were, inspired, to, produce, similar, pieces, of, their, own, included, charles, valentin, alkan, his, five, sets, of, chants, each, ending, with, a, barcarolle, and, anton, rubinstein, other, notable, piano, works, by, mendelssohn, include, his, variations, s, rieuses, op, 54, 1841, the, rondo, capriccioso, the, set, of, six, preludes,

performance, and, subsequent, performances, were, cancelled, although, he, never, abandoned, the, idea, of, composing, a, full, opera, and, considered, many, subjects, including, that, of, the, nibelung, saga, later, adapted, by, wagner, about, which, he, corresponded, with, his, sister, fanny, he, never, wrote, more, than, a, few, pages, of, sketches, for, any, project, in, mendelssohn, s,

written, by, mendelssohn, s, sister, fanny, originally, appeared, under, her, brother, s, name, this, may, have, been, partly, due, to, the, prejudice, of, the, family, and, partly, to, her, own, retiring, nature, in, 1842, this, resulted, in, an, embarrassing, moment, when, queen, victoria, receiving, felix, at, buckingham, palace, expressed, her, intention, of, singing, to, the, composer, her, favourite, of, his, songs, italien, to, words, by, franz, grillparzer, which, felix, confessed, was, by, fanny, during, his, lifetime, mendelssohn, became, renowned, as, a, keyboard, performer, both, on, the, piano, and, organ, one, of, his, obituarists, noted, first, and, chiefest, we, esteem, his, pianoforte, playing, with, its, amazing, elasticity, of, touch, rapidity, and, power, next, his, scientific, and, vigorous, organ, playing, his, triumphs, on, these, instruments, are, fresh, in, public, recollection, in, his, concerts, and, recitals, mendelssohn, performed, works, by, some, of, his, german, predecessors, notably, carl, maria, von, weber, beethoven, and, j, s, bach, whose, organ, music, he, brought, back, into, the, repertoire, virtually, alone, mendelssohn, admired, the, grand, pianos, of, the, viennese, maker, conrad, graf, he, acquired, one, in, 1832, which, he, used, in, the, family, house, and, recitals, in, berlin, and, later, another, for, use, in, d, sseldorf, in, private, and, public, performances, mendelssohn, was, celebrated, for, his, improvisations, on, one, occasion, in, london, when, asked, by, the, soprano, maria, malibran, after, a, recital, to, extemporise, he, improvised, a, piece, which, included, the, melodies, of, all, the, songs, she, had, sung, the, music, publisher, victor, novello, who, was, present, remarked, he, has, done, some, things, that, seem, to, me, impossible, even, after, i, have, heard, them, done, at, another, recital, in, 1837, where, mendelssohn, played, the, piano, for, a, singer, robert, schumann, ignored, the, soprano, and, wrote, mendelssohn, accompanied, like, a, god, mendelssohn, was, a, noted, conductor, both, of, his, own, works, and, of, those, by, other, composers, at, his, london, debut, in, 1829, he, was, noted, for, his, innovatory, use, of, a, baton, then, a, great, novelty, but, his, novelty, also, extended, to, taking, great, care, over, tempo, dynamics, and, the, orchestral, players, themselves, both, rebuking, them, when, they, were, recalcitrant, and, praising, them, when, they, satisfied, him, it, was, his, success, while, conducting, at, the, lower, rhine, music, festival, of, 1836, that, led, to, him, taking, his, first, paid, professional, position, as, director, at, d, sseldorf, among, those, appreciating, mendelssohn, s, conducting, was, hector, berlioz, who, in, 1843, invited, to, leipzig, exchanged, batons, with, mendelssohn, writing, when, the, great, spirit, sends, us, to, hunt, in, the, land, of, souls, may, our, warriors, hang, our, tomahawks, side, by, side, at, the, door, of, the, council, chamber, at, leipzig, mendelssohn, led, the, gewandhaus, orchestra, to, great, heights, although, concentrating, on, the, great, composers, of, the, past, already, becoming, canonised, as, the, classics, he, also, included, new, music, by, schumann, berlioz, gade, and, many, others, as, well, as, his, own, music, one, critic, who, was, not, impressed, was, richard, wagner, he, accused, mendelssohn, of, using, tempos, in, his, performances, of, beethoven, symphonies, that, were, far, too, fast, mendelssohn, s, interest, in, baroque, music, was, not, limited, to, the, bach, st, matthew, passion, which, he, had, revived, in, 1829, he, was, concerned, in, preparing, and, editing, such, music, whether, for, performance, or, for, publication, to, be, as, close, as, possible, to, the, original, intentions, of, the, composers, including, wherever, possible, a, close, study, of, early, editions, and, manuscripts, this, could, lead, him, into, conflict, with, publishers, for, instance, his, edition, of, handel, s, oratorio, israel, in, egypt, for, the, london, handel, society, 1845, evoked, an, often, contentious, correspondence, with, mendelssohn, refusing, for, example, to, add, dynamics, where, not, given, by, handel, or, to, add, parts, for, trombones, mendelssohn, also, edited, a, number, of, bach, s, works, for, organ, and, apparently, discussed, with, robert, schumann, the, possibility, of, producing, a, complete, bach, edition, although, mendelssohn, attributed, great, importance, to, musical, education, and, made, a, substantial, commitment, to, the, conservatoire, he, founded, in, leipzig, he, did, not, greatly, enjoy, teaching, and, took, only, a, very, few, private, pupils, who, he, believed, had, notable, qualities, such, students, included, the, composer, william, sterndale, bennett, the, pianist, camille, marie, stamaty, the, violinist, and, composer, julius, eichberg, and, walther, von, goethe, grandson, of, the, poet, at, the, leipzig, conservatoire, mendelssohn, taught, classes, in, composition, and, ensemble, playing, in, the, immediate, wake, of, mendelssohn, s, death, he, was, mourned, both, in, germany, and, england, however, the, conservative, strain, in, mendelssohn, which, set, him, apart, from, some, of, his, more, flamboyant, contemporaries, bred, a, corollary, condescension, amongst, some, of, them, toward, his, music, mendelssohn, s, relations, with, berlioz, liszt, and, others, had, been, uneasy, and, equivocal, listeners, who, had, raised, questions, about, mendelssohn, s, talent, included, heinrich, heine, who, wrote, in, 1836, after, hearing, the, oratorio, st, paul, that, his, work, was, characterized, by, a, great, strict, very, serious, seriousness, a, determined, almost, importunate, tendency, to, follow, classical, models, the, finest, cleverest, calculation, sharp, intelligence, and, finally, complete, lack, of, na, vet, but, is, there, in, art, any, originality, of, genius, without, na, vet, such, criticism, of, mendelssohn, for, his, very, ability, which, could, be, characterised, negatively, as, facility, was, taken, to, further, lengths, by, richard, wagner, mendelssohn, s, success, his, popularity, and, his, jewish, origins, irked, wagner, sufficiently, to, damn, mendelssohn, with, faint, praise, three, years, after, his, death, in, an, anti, jewish, pamphlet, das, judenthum, in, der, musik, has, shown, us, that, a, jew, may, have, the, amplest, store, of, specific, talents, may, own, the, finest, and, most, varied, culture, the, highest, and, tenderest, sense, of, honour, yet, without, all, these, pre, eminences, helping, him, were, it, but, one, single, time, to, call, forth, in, us, that, deep, that, heart, searching, effect, which, we, await, from, art, the, washiness, and, the, whimsicality, of, our, present, musical, style, has, been, pushed, to, its, utmost, pitch, by, mendelssohn, s, endeavour, to, speak, out, a, vague, an, almost, nugatory, content, as, interestingly, and, spiritedly, as, possible, the, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, expressed, consistent, admiration, for, mendelssohn, s, music, in, contrast, to, his, general, scorn, for, teutonic, romanticism, at, any, rate, the, whole, music, of, romanticism, was, second, rate, music, from, the, very, start, and, real, musicians, took, little, notice, of, it, things, were, different, with, felix, mendelssohn, that, halcyon, master, who, thanks, to, his, easier, purer, happier, soul, was, quickly, honoured, and, just, as, quickly, forgotten, as, a, lovely, incident, in, german, music, some, readers, however, have, interpreted, nietzsche, s, characterization, of, mendelssohn, as, a, lovely, incident, as, condescending, in, the, 20th, century, the, nazi, regime, and, its, reichsmusikkammer, cited, mendelssohn, s, jewish, origin, in, banning, performance, and, publication, of, his, works, even, asking, nazi, approved, composers, to, rewrite, incidental, music, for, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, carl, orff, obliged, under, the, nazis, mendelssohn, was, presented, as, a, dangerous, accident, of, music, history, who, played, a, decisive, role, in, rendering, german, music, in, the, 19th, century, degenerate, the, german, mendelssohn, scholarship, for, students, at, the, leipzig, conservatoire, was, discontinued, in, 1934, and, not, revived, until, 1963, the, monument, dedicated, to, mendelssohn, erected, in, leipzig, in, 1892, was, removed, by, the, nazis, in, 1936, a, replacement, was, erected, in, 2008, the, bronze, statue, of, mendelssohn, by, clemens, buscher, outside, the, d, sseldorf, opera, house, was, also, removed, and, destroyed, by, the, nazis, in, 1936, a, replacement, was, erected, in, 2012, mendelssohn, s, grave, remained, unmolested, during, the, nazi, years, mendelssohn, s, reputation, in, britain, remained, high, throughout, the, 19th, century, prince, albert, inscribed, in, german, a, libretto, for, the, oratorio, elijah, in, 1847, to, the, noble, artist, who, surrounded, by, the, baal, worship, of, false, art, has, been, able, like, a, second, elijah, through, genius, and, study, to, remain, true, to, the, service, of, true, art, in, 1851, an, adulatory, novel, by, the, teenaged, elizabeth, sara, sheppard, was, published, charles, auchester, the, book, features, as, its, leading, character, the, chevalier, seraphel, an, idealized, portrait, of, mendelssohn, and, remained, in, print, for, nearly, 80, years, in, 1854, queen, victoria, requested, that, the, crystal, palace, include, a, statue, of, mendelssohn, when, it, was, rebuilt, mendelssohn, s, wedding, march, from, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, was, played, at, the, wedding, of, queen, victoria, s, daughter, princess, victoria, the, princess, royal, to, crown, prince, frederick, william, of, prussia, in, 1858, and, it, remains, popular, at, marriage, ceremonies, mendelssohn, s, pupil, sterndale, bennett, was, a, major, force, in, british, musical, education, until, his, death, in, 1875, and, a, great, upholder, of, his, master, s, traditions, he, numbered, among, his, pupils, many, of, the, next, generation, of, english, composers, including, sullivan, hubert, parry, and, francis, edward, bache, by, the, early, twentieth, century, many, critics, including, bernard, shaw, began, to, condemn, mendelssohn, s, music, for, its, association, with, victorian, cultural, insularity, shaw, in, particular, complained, of, the, composer, s, kid, glove, gentility, his, conventional, sentimentality, and, his, despicable, oratorio, mongering, in, the, 1950s, the, scholar, wilfrid, mellers, complained, of, mendelssohn, s, spurious, religiosity, which, reflected, the, element, of, unconscious, humbug, in, our, morality, a, contrasting, opinion, came, from, the, pianist, and, composer, ferruccio, busoni, who, considered, mendelssohn, a, master, of, undisputed, greatness, and, an, heir, of, mozart, busoni, like, earlier, virtuosi, such, as, anton, rubinstein, and, charles, valentin, alkan, regularly, included, mendelssohn, s, piano, works, in, his, recitals, appreciation, of, mendelssohn, s, work, has, developed, since, the, mid, 20th, century, together, with, the, publication, of, a, number, of, biographies, placing, his, achievements, in, context, mercer, taylor, comments, on, the, irony, that, this, broad, based, reevaluation, of, mendelssohn, s, music, is, made, possible, in, part, by, a, general, disintegration, of, the, idea, of, a, musical, canon, an, idea, which, mendelssohn, as, a, conductor, pianist, and, scholar, had, done, so, much, to, establish, the, critic, h, l, mencken, concluded, that, if, mendelssohn, indeed, missed, true, greatness, he, missed, it, by, a, hair, charles, rosen, in, a, chapter, on, mendelssohn, in, his, 1995, book, the, romantic, generation, both, praised, and, criticized, the, composer, he, called, him, the, greatest, child, prodigy, the, history, of, western, music, has, ever, known, whose, command, at, age, 16, surpassed, that, of, mozart, or, chopin, at, 19, the, possessor, at, an, early, age, of, a, control, of, large, scale, structure, unsurpassed, by, any, composer, of, his, generation, and, a, genius, with, a, profound, comprehension, of, beethoven, rosen, believed, that, in, the, composer, s, later, years, without, losing, his, craft, or, genius, he, renounced, his, daring, but, he, called, mendelssohn, s, relatively, late, violin, concerto, in, e, minor, the, most, successful, synthesis, of, the, classical, concerto, tradition, and, the, romantic, virtuoso, form, rosen, considered, the, fugue, in, e, minor, later, included, in, mendelssohn, s, op, 35, for, piano, a, masterpiece, but, in, the, same, paragraph, called, mendelssohn, the, inventor, of, religious, kitsch, in, music, nevertheless, he, pointed, out, how, the, dramatic, power, of, the, juncture, of, religion, and, music, in, mendelssohn, s, oratorios, is, reflected, throughout, the, music, of, the, next, fifty, years, in, the, operas, of, meyerbeer, and, giuseppe, verdi, and, in, wagner, s, parsifal, a, large, portion, of, mendelssohn, s, 750, works, still, remained, unpublished, in, the, 1960s, but, most, of, them, are, now, available, a, scholarly, edition, of, mendelssohn, s, complete, works, and, correspondence, is, in, preparation, but, is, expected, to, take, many, years, to, complete, and, will, be, in, excess, of, 150, volumes, this, includes, a, modern, and, fully, researched, catalogue,

birth, the, intensifying, revival, of, the, composer, s, music, over, the, past, few, decades, and, that, his, image, has, been, largely, rehabilitated, as, musicians, and, scholars, have, returned,
