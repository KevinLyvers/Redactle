lieutenant, colonel, by, comparison, with, his, boss, mobutu, was, a, pillar, of, pragmatism, and, common, sense, it, was, to, him, that, we, appealed, when, our, people, were, arrested, by, lumumba, s, hashish, stimulated, guards, it, was, he, who, would, bring, up, in, a, disarmingly, casual, way, lumumba, s, most, outrageous, requests, that, the, un, should, for, example, meet, the, pay, roll, of, the, potentially, mutinous, congolese, army, in, those, early, days, mobutu, seemed, a, comparatively, sensible, young, man, one, who, might, even, at, least, now, and, then, have, the, best,

assistance, he, received, massive, military, aid, and, about, a, thousand, soviet, technical, advisers, within, six, weeks, as, this, was, during, the, cold, war, the, us, government, feared, that, the, soviet, activity, was, a, maneuver, to, spread, communist, influence, in, central, africa, kasa, vubu, was, encouraged, by, the, us, and, belgium, to, dismiss, lumumba, which, he, did, on, 5, september, an, outraged, lumumba, declared, kasa, vubu, deposed, parliament, refused, to, recognise, the, dismissals, and, urged, reconciliation, but, no, agreement, was, reached, lumumba, and, kasa, vubu, each, ordered, mobutu, to, arrest, the, other, as, army, chief, of, staff, mobutu, came, under, great, pressure, from, multiple, sources, the, embassies, of, western, nations, which, helped, pay, the, soldiers, salaries, as, well, as, kasa, vubu, and, mobutu, s, subordinates, all, favored, getting, rid, of, the, soviet, presence, on, 14, september, mobutu, launched, a, bloodless, coup, declaring, both, kasa, vubu, and, lumumba, to, be, neutralised, and, establishing, a, new, government, of, university, graduates, the, college, of, commissioners, general, lumumba, rejected, this, action, but, was, forced, to, retire, to, his, residence, where, un, peacekeepers, prevented, mobutu, s, soldiers, from, arresting, him, urquhart, recalled, that, on, the, day, of, the, coup, mobutu, showed, up, unannounced, at, the, un, headquarters, in, l, opoldville, and, refused, to, leave, until, the, radio, announced, the, coup, leading, mobutu, to, say, over, and, over, again, c, est, moi, this, is, me, recognizing, that, mobutu, had, only, gone, to, the, un, headquarters, in, case, the, coup, should, fail, urquhart, ordered, him, out, losing, confidence, that, the, international, community, would, support, his, reinstatement, lumumba, fled, in, late, november, to, join, his, supporters, in, stanleyville, to, establish, a, new, government, he, was, captured, by, mobutu, s, troops, in, early, december, and, incarcerated, at, his, headquarters, in, thysville, however, mobutu, still, considered, him, a, threat, and, transferred, him, to, the, rebelling, state, of, katanga, on, 17, january, 1961, lumumba, disappeared, from, public, view, it, was, later, discovered, that, he, was, executed, the, same, day, by, the, secessionist, forces, of, moise, tshombe, after, mobutu, s, government, turned, him, over, on, 23, january, 1961, kasa, vubu, promoted, mobutu, to, major, general, historian, de, witte, argues, that, this, was, a, political, action, aimed, to, strengthen,

confirm, him, with, the, government, in, near, paralysis, mobutu, seized, power, in, a, bloodless, coup, on, 24, november, he, had, turned, 35, a, month, earlier, under, the, auspices, of, a, state, of, exception, regime, d, exception, mobutu, assumed, sweeping, almost, absolute, powers, for, five, years, in, his, first, speech, upon, taking, power, mobutu, told, a, large, crowd, at, l, opoldville, s, main, stadium, that, since, politicians, had, brought, the, congo, to, ruin, in, five, years, it, would, take, him, at, least, that, long, to, set, things, right, again, and, therefore, there, would, be, no, more, political, party, activity, for, five, years, on, 30, november, 1965, parliament, approved, a, measure, which, turned, over, most, legislative, powers, to, mobutu, and,

review, and, two, weeks, later, his, government, permanently, suspended, the, body, and, assumed, all, of, its, remaining, functions, initially, mobutu, s, government, presented, itself, as, apolitical, or, even, anti, political, the, word, politician, carried, negative, connotations, and, became, almost, synonymous, with, someone, who, was, wicked, or, corrupt, in, 1966, the, corps, of, volunteers, of, the, republic, was, established, a, vanguard, movement, designed, to, mobilize, popular, support, behind, mobutu, who, was, proclaimed, the, nation, s, second, national, hero, after, lumumba, despite, the, role, he, played, in, lumumba, s, ousting, mobutu, worked, to, present, himself, as, a, successor, to, lumumba, s, legacy, one, of, his, key, tenets, early, in, his, rule, was,

that, no, one, would, pose, a, threat, to, his, rule, between, november, 1965, and, april, 1997, mobutu, reshuffled, his, cabinet, 60, times, the, frequent, cabinet, reshuffles, as, intended, encouraged, insecurity, in, his, ministers, who, knew, that, the, mercurial, mobutu, would, reshuffle, his, cabinet, with, no, regard, for, efficiency, and, competence, on, the, part, of, his, ministers, the, frequency, that, men, entered, and, left, the, cabinet, also, encouraged, gross, corruption, because, ministers, never, knew, how, long, they, might, be, in, office, thus, encouraging, them, to, steal, as, much, as, possible, while, they, were, in, the, cabinet, another, tactic, was, to, arrest, and, sometimes, torture, dissident, members, of, the, government, only, to, later, pardon, them, and, reward, them, with, high, office, the, congolese, historian, emizet, f, kisangani, wrote, most, public, officials, knew, that, regardless, of, their, inefficiency, and, degree, of, corruption, they, could, reenter, the, government, to, hold, a, government, position, required, neither, a, sense, of, management, nor, a, good, conscience, on, most, occasions, effectiveness, and, a, good, conscience, were, major, obstacles, to, political, advancement, mobutu, demanded, absolute, personal, allegiance, in, return, for, the, opportunity, to, accumulate, wealth, as, early, as, 1970, it, was, estimated, that, mobutu, had, stolen, 60, of, the, national, budget, that, year, marking, him, as, one, of, the, most, corrupt, leaders, in, africa, and, the, world, kisangani, wrote, that, mobutu, created, a, system, of, institutional, corruption, that, greatly, debased, public, morality, by, rewarding, venality, and, greed, in, 1972, mobutu, tried, unsuccessfully, to, have, himself, named, president, for, life, in, june, 1983, he, raised, himself, to, the, rank, of, marshal, the, order, was, signed, by, general, likulia, bolongo, victor, nendaka, bika, in, his, capacity, as, vice, president, of, the, bureau, of, the, central, committee, second, authority, in, the, land, addressed, a, speech, filled, with, praise, for, president, mobutu, to, gain, the, revenues, of, congolese, resources, mobutu, initially, nationalized, foreign, owned, firms, and, forced, european, investors, out, of, the, country, but, in, many, cases, he, handed, the, management, of, these, firms, to, relatives, and, close, associates, who, quickly, exercised, their, own, corruption, and, stole, the, companies, assets, in, 1973, 1974, mobutu, launched, his, zairianization, campaign, nationalising, foreign, owned, businesses, that, were, handed, over, to, zairians, in, october, 1973, the, arab, oil, shock, ended, the, long, summer, of, prosperity, in, the, west, that, had, begun, in, 1945, and, sent, the, world, economy, into, its, sharpest, contraction, since, the, great, depression, one, consequence, of, the, oil, shock, and, the, resulting, global, recession, was, that, the, price, of, copper, dropped, by, 50, over, the, course, of, 1974, which, proved, to, be, a, disaster, for, zaire, as, copper, was, its, most, important, export, the, american, historian, thomas, odom, wrote, because, of, the, collapse, in, copper, prices, zaire, went, from, prosperity, to, bankruptcy, almost, overnight, in, 1974, the, economic, collapse, forced, zaire, to, turn, towards, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, to, help, it, manage, its, debts, which, could, no, longer, be, serviced, seeking, an, alternative, source, of, support, as, the, auditors, for, the, imf, discovered, major, corruption, within, the, zairian, finances, mobutu, visited, china, in, 1974, and, returned, wearing, a, mao, jacket, and, the, new, title, of, citoyen, mobutu, citizen, mobutu, influenced, by, the, cultural, revolution, mobutu, shifted, to, the, left, and, announced, his, intention, to, radicalize, the, zairian, revolution, the, businesses, that, mobutu, had, just, handed, over, to, zairians, were, in, turn, nationalized, and, placed, under, state, control, at, the, same, time, mobutu, imposed, a, 50, salary, cut, to, state, employees, which, led, a, failed, coup, attempt, against, him, in, june, 1975, by, 1977, mobutu, s, nationalizations, had, precipitated, such, an, economic, slump, that, mobutu, was, forced, to, try, to, woo, foreign, investors, back, katangan, rebels, based, in, angola, invaded, zaire, that, year, in, retaliation, for, mobutu, s, support, for, anti, mpla, rebels, france, airlifted, 1, 500, moroccan, paratroopers, into, the, country, and, repulsed, the, rebels, ending, shaba, i, the, rebels, attacked, zaire, again, in, greater, numbers, in, the, shaba, ii, invasion, of, 1978, the, governments, of, belgium, and, france, deployed, troops, with, logistical, support, from, the, united, states, and, defeated, the, rebels, again, the, poor, performance, of, the, zairian, army, during, both, shaba, invasions, which, humiliated, mobutu, by, forcing, him, to, ask, for, foreign, troops, did, not, lead, to, military, reforms, however, mobutu, reduced, the, size, of, the, army, from, 51, 000, troops, in, 1978, down, to, 23, 000, troops, in, 1980, by, 1980, it, was, estimated, that, about, 90, of, the, zairian, army, were, ngbandi, as, mobutu, did, not, trust, the, other, peoples, of, zaire, to, serve, in, the, army, the, most, loyal, and, best, of, mobutu, s, units, were, his, bodyguards, the, israeli, trained, division, sp, ciale, pr, sidentielle, that, was, made, up, exclusively, of, ngbandi, and, was, always, commanded, by, one, of, mobutu, s, relatives, mobutu, was, re, elected, in, single, candidate, elections, in, 1977, and, 1984, he, spent, most, of, his, time, increasing, his, personal, fortune, which, in, 1988, was, estimated, to, amount, to, no, less, than, us, 50, million, he, held, most, of, it, out, of, the, country, in, swiss, banks, however, a, comparatively, small, 3, 4, million, was, declared, found, in, swiss, banks, after, he, was, ousted, this, was, almost, equivalent, to, the, amount, of, the, country, s, foreign, debt, at, the, time, in, a, speech, that, he, delivered, on, 20, may, 1976, in, a, football, stadium, in, kinshasa, that, was, filled, with, some, 70, 000, people, mobutu, openly, accepted, petty, corruption, stating, if, you, want, to, steal, steal, a, little, in, a, nice, way, but, if, you, steal, too, much, to, become, rich, overnight, you, will, be, caught, by, 1989, the, government, was, forced, to, default, on, international, loans, from, belgium, mobutu, owned, a, fleet, of, mercedes, benz, vehicles, that, he, used, to, travel, between, his, numerous, palaces, while, the, nation, s, roads, deteriorated, and, many, of, his, people, starved, the, infrastructure, virtually, collapsed, and, many, public, service, workers, went, months, without, being, paid, most, of, the, money, was, siphoned, off, to, mobutu, his, family, and, top, political, and, military, leaders, only, the, special, presidential, division, on, whom, his, physical, safety, depended, was, paid, adequately, or, regularly, a, popular, saying, that, the,

irregular, salaries, dismal, living, conditions, shortages, of, supplies, and, a, venal, officer, corps, the, soldiers, of, the, faz, behaved, very, much, like, a, brutal, occupying, force, who, supported, themselves, by, robbing, the, civilian, population, of, zaire, a, recurring, feature, of, mobutu, s, rule, were, the, seemingly, endless, number, of, roadblocks, put, by, the, faz, who, extorted, money, from, the, drivers, of, any, passing, automobile, or, lorries, another, feature, of, mobutu, s, economic, mismanagement, directly, linked, to, the, way, he, and, his, friends, siphoned, off, so, much, of, the, country, s, wealth, was, rampant, inflation, the, rapid, decline, in, the, real, value, of, salaries, strongly, encouraged, a, culture, of, corruption, and, dishonesty, among, public, servants, of, all, kinds, mobutu, was, known, for, his, opulent, lifestyle, he, cruised, on, the, congo, on, his, yacht, kamanyola, in, gbadolite, he, erected, a, palace, the, versailles, of, the, jungle, for, shopping, trips, to, paris, he, would, charter, a, concorde, from, air, france, he, had, the, gbadolite, airport, constructed, with, a, runway, long, enough, to, accommodate, the, concorde, s, extended, take, off, and, landing, requirements, in, 1989, mobutu, chartered, concorde, aircraft, f, btsd, for, a, 26, june, 5, july, trip, to, give, a, speech, at, the, united, nations, in, new, york, city, then, again, on, 16, july, for, french, bicentennial, celebrations, in, paris, where, he, was, a, guest, of, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, and, on, 19, september, for, a, flight, from, paris, to, gbadolite, and, another, nonstop, flight, from, gbadolite, to, marseille, with, the, youth, choir, of, zaire, mobutu, s, rule, earned, a, reputation, as, one, of, the, world, s, foremost, examples, of, kleptocracy, and, nepotism, close, relatives, and, fellow, members, of, the, ngbandi, tribe, were, awarded, high, positions, in, the, military, and, government, and, he, groomed, his, eldest, son, nyiwa, to, succeed, him, as, president, however, nyiwa, died, from, aids, in, 1994, mobutu, led, one, of, the, most, enduring, autocracies, in, africa, and, amassed, a, personal, fortune, estimated, to, be, over, us, 50, million, by, selling, his, nation, s, rich, natural, resources, while, the, people, lived, in, poverty, while, in, office, he, formed, a, totalitarian, regime, responsible, for, numerous, human, rights, violations, attempted, to, purge, the, country, of, all, belgian, cultural, influences, and, maintained, an, anti, communist, stance, to, gain, positive, international, support, mobutu, was, the, subject, of, one, of, the, most, pervasive, personality, cults, of, the, twentieth, century, the, evening, newscast, opened, with, an, image, of, him, descending, through, clouds, like, a, god, his, portraits, were, hung, in, many, public, places, and, government, officials, wore, lapel, pins, bearing, his, portrait, he, held, such, titles, as, father, of, the, nation, messiah, guide, of, the, revolution, helmsman, founder, savior, of, the, people, and, supreme, combatant, in, the, 1996, documentary, of, the, 1974, foreman, ali, fight, in, zaire, dancers, receiving, the, fighters, can, be, heard, chanting, sese, seko, sese, seko, at, one, point, in, early, 1975, the, media, were, forbidden, to, refer, to, anyone, other, than, mobutu, by, name, others, were, referred, to, only, by, the, positions, they, held, mobutu, successfully, capitalized, on, cold, war, tensions, among, european, nations, and, the, united, states, he, gained, significant, support, from, the, west, and, its, international, organizations, such, as, the, international, monetary, fund, in, the, late, 1970s, the, west, germany, company, otrag, was, developing, a, program, to, send, peaceful, satellites, into, space, at, lower, costs, but, a, 1954, amendment, to, the, treaty, of, brussels, prevented, them, from, developing, and, launching, missiles, in, germany, as, a, result, they, paid, mobutu, 130, million, to, develop, their, program, in, zaire, in, a, 1978, agreement, with, otrag, mobutu, gave, the, company, a, 25, year, rented, plot, of, land, in, zaire, the, first, rocket, otrag, 1, was, launched, on, may, 18, 1977, while, mobutu, watched, from, a, distance, the, rocket, took, off, successfully, but, shortly, afterwards, fell, and, crashed, back, down, to, the, ground, by, june, 6, of, 1978, two, more, rockets, had, been, launched, and, crashed, in, zaire, nevertheless, mobutu, continued, to, promote, the, program, stating, that, 200, zairians, were, employed, by, the, project, and, the, country, would, receive, royalties, from, future, rocket, sales, two, years, after, the, launch, of, the, first, rocket, the, soviet, union, alleged, that, former, nazi, scientists, were, involved, with, otrag, and, became, convinced, that, the, company, was, secretly, gathering, military, intelligence, mobutu, succumbed, to, soviet, pressure, ended, the, program, and, cut, ties, with, otrag, relations, between, zaire, and, belgium, wavered, between, close, intimacy, and, open, hostility, during, the, mobutu, years, more, often, than, not, belgian, decision, makers, responded, in, a, lackluster, way, when, mobutu, acted, against, the, interests, of, belgium, partly, explained, by, the, highly, divided, belgian, political, class, relations, soured, early, in, mobutu, s, rule, over, disputes, involving, the, substantial, belgian, commercial, and, industrial, holdings, in, the, country, but, they, warmed, soon, afterwards, mobutu, and, his, family, were, received, as, personal, guests, of, the, belgian, monarch, in, 1968, and, a, convention, for, scientific, and, technical, cooperation, was, signed, that, same, year, during, king, baudouin, s, highly, successful, visit, to, kinshasa, in, 1970, a, treaty, of, friendship, and, cooperation, between, the, two, countries, was, signed, however, mobutu, tore, up, the, treaty, in, 1974, in, protest, at, belgium, s, refusal, to, ban, an, anti, mobutu, book, written, by, left, wing, lawyer, jules, chom, mobutu, s, zairianisation, policy, which, expropriated, foreign, held, businesses, and, transferred, their, ownership, to, zairians, added, to, the, strain, mobutu, maintained, several, personal, contacts, with, prominent, belgians, edmond, leburton, belgian, prime, minister, between, 1973, and, 1974, was, someone, greatly, admired, by, the, president, alfred, cahen, career, diplomat, and, chef, de, cabinet, of, minister, henri, simonet, became, a, personal, friend, of, mobutu, when, he, was, a, student, at, the, universit, libre, de, bruxelles, relations, with, king, baudouin, were, mostly, cordial, until, mobutu, released, a, bold, statement, about, the, belgian, royal, family, prime, minister, wilfried, martens, recalled, in, his, memoirs, that, the, palace, gates, closed, completely, after, mobutu, published, a, handwritten, letter, of, the, king, because, of, that, mobutu, was, one, of, only, two, heads, of, state, who, did, not, receive, an, invitation, to, the, funeral, of, baudouin, the, other, being, saddam, hussein, of, iraq, next, to, friendly, ties, with, belgians, residing, in, belgium, mobutu, had, a, number, of, belgian, advisors, at, his, disposal, some, of, them, such, as, hugues, leclercq, and, colonel, willy, mallants, were, interviewed, in, thierry, michel, s, documentary, mobutu, king, of, zaire, as, what, was, then, the, second, most, populous, french, speaking, country, in, the, world, it, has, subsequently, come, to, have, a, larger, population, than, france, and, the, most, populous, one, in, sub, saharan, africa, zaire, was, of, great, strategic, interest, to, france, during, the, first, republic, era, france, tended, to, side, with, the, conservative, and, federalist, forces, as, opposed, to, unitarists, such, as, lumumba, shortly, after, the, katangan, secession, was, successfully, crushed, zaire, then, called, the, republic, of, the, congo, signed, a, treaty, of, technical, and, cultural, cooperation, with, france, during, the, presidency, of, charles, de, gaulle, diplomatic, relations, between, the, two, countries, gradually, grew, stronger, and, closer, due, to, their, many, shared, geopolitical, interests, in, 1971, finance, minister, val, ry, giscard, d, estaing, paid, a, visit, to, zaire, later, after, becoming, france, s, president, he, would, develop, a, close, personal, relationship, with, president, mobutu, and, under, his, leadership, france, became, one, of, the, mobutu, regime, s, closest, and, most, important, foreign, allies, during, the, shaba, invasions, france, sided, firmly, with, mobutu, during, the, first, shaba, invasion, france, airlifted, 1, 500, moroccan, troops, to, zaire, and, the, rebels, were, repulsed, a, year, later, during, the, second, shaba, invasion, france, itself, along, with, belgium, would, send, french, foreign, legion, paratroopers, 2nd, foreign, parachute, regiment, to, aid, mobutu, initially, zaire, s, relationship, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, no, better, than, its, relationship, with, the, soviet, union, memories, of, chinese, aid, to, mulele, and, other, maoist, rebels, in, kwilu, province, during, the, ill, fated, simba, rebellion, remained, fresh, on, mobutu, s, mind, he, also, opposed, seating, the, prc, at, the, united, nations, however, by, 1972, he, began, to, see, the, chinese, in, a, different, light, as, a, counterbalance, to, both, the, soviet, union, as, well, as, his, intimate, ties, with, the, united, states, israel, and, south, africa, in, november, 1972, mobutu, extended, diplomatic, recognition, to, the, chinese, as, well, as, east, germany, and, north, korea, the, following, year, mobutu, paid, a, visit, to, beijing, where, he, met, with, chairman, mao, zedong, and, received, promises, of, 100, million, in, technical, aid, in, 1974, mobutu, made, a, surprise, visit, to, both, china, and, north, korea, during, the, time, he, was, originally, scheduled, to, visit, the, soviet, union, upon, returning, home, both, his, politics, and, rhetoric, became, markedly, more, radical, it, was, around, this, time, that, mobutu, began, criticizing, belgium, and, the, united, states, the, latter, for, not, doing, enough, in, mobutu, s, opinion, to, combat, white, minority, rule, in, south, africa, and, rhodesia, introduced, the, obligatory, civic, work, program, called, salongo, and, initiated, radicalization, an, extension, of, 1973, s, zairianization, policy, mobutu, even, borrowed, a, title, the, helmsman, from, mao, incidentally, late, 1974, to, early, 1975, was, when, his, personality, cult, reached, its, peak, china, and, zaire, shared, a, common, goal, in, central, africa, namely, doing, everything, in, their, power, to, halt, soviet, gains, in, the, area, accordingly, both, zaire, and, china, covertly, funneled, aid, to, the, national, liberation, front, of, angola, and, later, the, national, union, for, the, total, independence, of, angola, in, order, to, prevent, their, former, allies, the, people, s, movement, for, the, liberation, of, angola, who, were, supported, and, augmented, by, cuban, forces, from, coming, to, power, the, cubans, who, exercised, considerable, influence, in, africa, in, support, of, leftist, and, anti, imperialist, forces, were, heavily, sponsored, by, the, soviet, union, during, the, period, in, addition, to, inviting, holden, roberto, the, leader, of, the, national, liberation, front, of, angola, and, his, guerrillas, to, beijing, for, training, china, provided, weapons, and, money, to, the, rebels, zaire, itself, launched, an, ill, fated, pre, emptive, invasion, of, angola, in, a, bid, to, install, a, pro, kinshasa, government, but, was, repulsed, by, cuban, troops, the, expedition, was, a, fiasco, with, far, reaching, repercussions, most, notably, the, shaba, i, and, shaba, ii, invasions, both, of, which, china, opposed, china, sent, military, aid, to, zaire, during, both, invasions, and, accused, the, soviet, union, and, cuba, who, were, alleged, to, have, supported, the, shaban, rebels, although, this, was, and, remains, speculation, of, working, to, de, stabilize, central, africa, mobutu, s, relationship, with, the, soviet, union, was, frosty, and, tense, a, staunch, anti, communist, he, was, not, anxious, to, recognize, the, soviets, the, ussr, had, supported, though, mostly, in, words, both, patrice, lumumba, mobutu, s, democratically, elected, predecessor, and, the, simba, rebellion, however, to, project, a, non, aligned, image, he, did, renew, ties, in, 1967, the, first, soviet, ambassador, arrived, and, presented, his, credentials, in, 1968, mobutu, did, however, join, the, united, states, in, condemning, the, soviet, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, that, year, mobutu, viewed, the, soviet, presence, as, advantageous, for, two, reasons, it, allowed, him, to, maintain, an, image, of, non, alignment, and, it, provided, a, convenient, scapegoat, for, problems, at, home, for, example, in, 1970, he, expelled, four, soviet, diplomats, for, carrying, out, subversive, activities, and, in, 1971, twenty, soviet, officials, were, declared, persona, non, grata, for, allegedly, instigating, student, demonstrations, at, lovanium, university, moscow, was, the, only, major, world, capital, mobutu, never, visited, although, he, did, accept, an, invitation, to, do, so, in, 1974, for, reasons, unknown, he, cancelled, the, visit, at, the, last, minute, and, toured, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, north, korea, instead, relations, cooled, further, in, 1975, when, the, two, countries, found, themselves, on, opposing, sides, in, the, angolan, civil, war, this, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, zairian, foreign, policy, for, the, next, decade, bereft, of, his, claim, to, african, leadership, mobutu, was, one, of, the, few, leaders, who, refused, to, recognize, the, marxist, government, of, angola, mobutu, turned, increasingly, to, the, us, and, its, allies, adopting, pro, american, stances, on, such, issues, as, the, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, and, israel, s, position, in, international, organizations, for, the, most, part, zaire, enjoyed, warm, relations, with, the, united, states, the, united, states, was, the, third, largest, donor, of, aid, to, zaire, after, belgium, and, france, and, mobutu, befriended, several, us, presidents, including, richard, nixon, ronald, reagan, and, george, h, w, bush, relations, did, cool, significantly, in, 1974, 1975, over, mobutu, s, increasingly, radical, rhetoric, which, included, his, scathing, denunciations, of, american, foreign, policy, and, plummeted, to, an, all, time, low, in, the, summer, of, 1975, when, mobutu, accused, the, central, intelligence, agency, of, plotting, his, overthrow, and, arrested, eleven, senior, zairian, generals, and, several, civilians, and, condemned, in, absentia, a, former, head, of, the, central, bank, albert, ndele, however, many, people, viewed, these, charges, with, skepticism, in, fact, one, of, mobutu, s, staunchest, critics, nzongola, ntalaja, speculated, that, mobutu, invented, the, plot, as, an, excuse, to, purge, the, military, of, talented, officers, who, might, otherwise, pose, a, threat, to, his, rule, in, spite, of, these, hindrances, the, chilly, relationship, quickly, thawed, when, both, countries, found, each, other, supporting, the, same, side, during, the, angolan, civil, war, because, of, mobutu, s, poor, human, rights, record, the, carter, administration, put, some, distance, between, itself, and, the, kinshasa, government, even, so, zaire, received, nearly, half, the, foreign, aid, carter, allocated, to, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, first, shaba, invasion, the, united, states, played, a, relatively, inconsequential, role, its, belated, intervention, consisted, of, little, more, than, the, delivery, of, non, lethal, supplies, but, during, the, second, shaba, invasion, the, us, played, a, much, more, active, and, decisive, role, by, providing, transportation, and, logistical, support, to, the, french, and, belgian, paratroopers, that, were, deployed, to, aid, mobutu, against, the, rebels, carter, echoed, mobutu, s, unsubstantiated, charges, of, soviet, and, cuban, aid, to, the, rebels, until, it, was, apparent, that, no, hard, evidence, existed, to, verify, his, claims, in, 1980, the, us, house, of, representatives, voted, to, terminate, military, aid, to, zaire, but, the, us, senate, reinstated, the, funds, in, response, to, pressure, from, carter, and, american, business, interests, in, zaire, mobutu, enjoyed, a, very, warm, relationship, with, the, reagan, administration, through, financial, donations, during, reagan, s, presidency, mobutu, visited, the, white, house, three, times, and, criticism, of, zaire, s, human, rights, record, by, the, us, was, effectively, muted, during, a, state, visit, by, mobutu, in, 1983, reagan, praised, the, zairian,
