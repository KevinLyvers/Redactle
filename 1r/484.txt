music, repertoire, along, with, suites, and, excerpts, from, some, of, his, fifteen, operas, scheherazade, is, an, example, of, his, frequent, use, of, fairy, tale, and, folk, subjects, rimsky, korsakov, believed, in, developing, a, nationalistic, style, of, classical, music, as, did, his, fellow, composer, mily, balakirev, and, the, critic, vladimir, stasov, this, style, employed, russian, folk, song, and, lore, along, with, exotic, harmonic, melodic, and, rhythmic, elements, in, a, practice, known, as, musical, orientalism, and, eschewed, traditional, western, compositional, methods, rimsky, korsakov, appreciated, western, musical, techniques, after, he, became, a, professor, of, musical, composition, harmony, and, orchestration, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, in, 1871, he, undertook, a, rigorous, three, year, program, of, self, education, and, became, a, master, of, western, methods, incorporating, them, alongside, the, influences, of, mikhail, glinka, and, fellow, members, of, the, five, rimsky, korsakov, s, techniques, of, composition, and, orchestration, were, further, enriched, by, his, exposure, to, the, works, of, richard, wagner, for, much, of, his, life, rimsky, korsakov, combined, his, composition, and, teaching, with, a, career, in, the, russian, armed, forces, first, as, an, officer, in, the, imperial, russian, navy, then, as, the, civilian, inspector, of, naval, bands, he, wrote, that, he, developed, a, passion, for, the, ocean, in, childhood, from, reading, books, and, hearing, of, his, older, brother, s, exploits, in, the, navy, this, love, of, the, sea, may, have, influenced, him, to, write, two, of, his, best, known, orchestral, works, the, musical, tableau, sadko, not, to, be, confused, with, his, later, opera, of, the, same, name, and, scheherazade, as, inspector, of, naval, bands, rimsky, korsakov, expanded, his, knowledge, of, woodwind, and, brass, playing, which, enhanced, his, abilities, in, orchestration, he, passed, this, knowledge, to, his, students, and, also, posthumously, through, a, textbook, on, orchestration, that, was, completed, by, his, son, in, law, maximilian, steinberg, rimsky, korsakov, left, a, considerable, body, of, original, russian, nationalist, compositions, he, prepared, works, by, the, five, for, performance, which, brought, them, into, the, active, classical, repertoire, although, there, is, controversy, over, his, editing, of, the, works, of, modest, mussorgsky, and, shaped, a, generation, of, younger, composers, and, musicians, during, his, decades, as, an, educator, rimsky, korsakov, is, therefore, considered, the, main, architect, of, what, the, classical, music, public, considers, the, russian, style, his, influence, on, younger, composers, was, especially, important, as, he, served, as, a, transitional, figure, between, the, autodidactism, exemplified, by, glinka, and, the, five, and, professionally, trained, composers, who, became, the, norm, in, russia, by, the, closing, years, of, the, 19th, century, while, rimsky, korsakov, s, style, was, based, on, those, of, glinka, balakirev, hector, berlioz, franz, liszt, and, for, a, brief, period, wagner, he, transmitted, this, style, directly, to, two, generations, of, russian, composers, and, influenced, non, russian, composers, including, maurice, ravel, claude, debussy, paul, dukas, and, ottorino,

by, ear, beginning, at, six, he, took, piano, lessons, from, local, teachers, and, showed, a, talent, for, aural, skills, but, he, showed, a, lack, of, interest, playing, as, he, later, wrote, badly, carelessly, poor, at, keeping, time, although, he, started, composing, by, age, 10, rimsky, korsakov, preferred, literature, to, music, he, later, wrote, that, from, his, reading, and, tales, of, his, brother, s, exploits, he, developed, a, poetic, love, for, the, sea, without, ever, having, seen, it, this, love, with, subtle, prompting, from, voin, encouraged, the, 12, year, old, to, join, the, imperial, russian, navy, he, studied, at, the, school, for, mathematical, and, navigational, sciences, in, saint, petersburg, and, at, 18, took, his, final, examination, in, april, 1862, while, at, school, rimsky, korsakov, took, piano, lessons, from, a, man, named, ulikh, voin, now, director, of, the, school, sanctioned, these, lessons, because, he, hoped, they, would, help, nikolai, develop, social, skills, and, overcome, his, shyness, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, while, indifferent, to, lessons, he, developed, a, love, for, music, fostered, by, visits, to, the, opera, and, later, orchestral, concerts, ulikh, perceived, rimsky, korsakov, s, musical, talent, and, recommended, another, teacher, feodor, a, kanille, th, odore, canill, beginning, in, late, 1859, rimsky, korsakov, took, lessons, in, piano, and, composition, from, kanille, whom, he, later, credited, as, the, inspiration, for, devoting, his, life, to, composition, through, kanille, he, was, exposed, to, a, great, deal, of, new, music, including, mikhail, glinka, and, robert, schumann, voin, cancelled, his, brother, nikolai, s, musical, lessons, when, the, latter, reached, age, 17, feeling, they, no, longer, served, a, practical, purpose, kanille, told, rimsky, korsakov, to, continue, coming, to, him, every, sunday, not, for, formal, lessons, but, to, play, duets, and, discuss, music, in, november, 1861, kanille, introduced, the, 18, year, old, nikolai, to, mily, balakirev, balakirev, in, turn, introduced, him, to, c, sar, cui, and, modest, mussorgsky, all, three, were, known, as, composers, despite, only, being, in, their, 20s, rimsky, korsakov, later, wrote, with, what, delight, i, listened, to, real, business, discussions, of, instrumentation, part, writing, etc, and, besides, how, much, talking, there, was, about, current, musical, matters, all, at, once, i, had, been, plunged, into, a, new, world, unknown, to, me, formerly, only, heard, of, in, the, society, of, my, dilettante, friends, that, was, truly, a, strong, impression, balakirev, encouraged, rimsky, korsakov, to, compose, and, taught, him, the, rudiments, when, he, was, not, at, sea, balakirev, prompted, him, to, enrich, himself, in, history, literature, and, criticism, when, he, showed, balakirev, the, beginning, of, a, symphony, in, e, flat, minor, that, he, had, written, balakirev, insisted, he, continue, working, on, it, despite, his, lack, of, formal, musical, training, by, the, time, rimsky, korsakov, sailed, on, a, two, year, and, eight, month, cruise, aboard, the, clipper, almaz, in, late, 1862, he, had, completed, and, orchestrated, three, movements, of, the, symphony, he, composed, the, slow, movement, during, a, stop, in, england, and, mailed, the, score, to, balakirev, before, going, back, to, sea, at, first, his, work, on, the, symphony, kept, rimsky, korsakov, occupied, during, his, cruise, he, purchased, scores, at, every, port, of, call, along, with, a, piano, on, which, to, play, them, and, filled, his, idle, hours, studying, berlioz, s, treatise, on, instrumentation, he, found, time, to, read, the, works, of, homer, william, shakespeare, friedrich, schiller, and, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, he, saw, london, niagara, falls, and, rio, de, janeiro, during, his, stops, in, port, eventually, the, lack, of, outside, musical, stimuli, dulled, the, young, midshipman, s, hunger, to, learn, he, wrote, to, balakirev, that, after, two, years, at, sea, he, had, neglected, his, musical, lessons, for, months, thoughts, of, becoming, a, musician, and, composer, gradually, left, me, altogether, he, later, recalled, distant, lands, began, to, allure, me, somehow, although, properly, speaking, naval, service, never, pleased, me, much, and, hardly, suited, my, character, at, all, once, back, in, saint, petersburg, in, may, 1865, rimsky, korsakov, s, onshore, duties, consisted, of, a, couple, of, hours, of, clerical, duty, each, day, but, he, recalled, that, his, desire, to, compose, had, been, stifled, i, did, not, concern, myself, with, music, at, all, he, wrote, that, contact, with, balakirev, in, september, 1865, encouraged, him, to, get, accustomed, to, music, and, later, to, plunge, into, it, at, balakirev, s, suggestion, he, wrote, a, trio, to, the, scherzo, of, the, e, flat, minor, symphony, which, it, had, lacked, up, to, that, point, and, reorchestrated, the, entire, symphony, its, first, performance, came, in, december, of, that, year, under, balakirev, s, direction, in, saint, petersburg, a, second, performance, followed, in, march, 1866, under, the, direction, of, konstantin, lyadov, father, of, composer, anatoly, lyadov, correspondence, between, rimsky, korsakov, and, balakirev, clearly, shows, that, some, ideas, for, the, symphony, originated, with, balakirev, who, seldom, stopped, at, merely, correcting, a, piece, of, music, and, would, often, recompose, it, at, the, piano, rimsky, korsakov, recalled, a, pupil, like, myself, had, to, submit, to, balakirev, a, proposed, composition, in, its, embryo, say, even, the, first, four, or, eight, bars, balakirev, would, immediately, make, corrections, indicating, how, to, recast, such, an, embryo, he, would, criticize, it, would, praise, and, extol, the, first, two, bars, but, would, censure, the, next, two, ridicule, them, and, try, hard, to, make, the, author, disgusted, with, them, vivacity, of, composition, and, fertility, were, not, at, all, in, favor, frequent, recasting, was, demanded, and, the, composition, was, extended, over, a, long, period, of, time, under, the, cold, control, of, self, criticism, rimsky, korsakov, recalled, that, balakirev, had, no, difficulty, in, getting, along, with, me, at, his, suggestion, i, most, readily, rewrote, the, symphonic, movements, composed, by, me, and, brought, them, to, completion, with, the, help, of, his, advice, and, improvisations, though, rimsky, korsakov, later, found, balakirev, s, influence, stifling, and, broke, free, from, it, this, did, not, stop, him, in, his, memoirs, from, extolling, the, older, composer, s, talents, as, a, critic, and, improviser, under, balakirev, s, mentoring, rimsky, korsakov, turned, to, other, compositions, he, began, a, symphony, in, b, minor, but, felt, it, too, closely, followed, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, and, abandoned, it, he, completed, an, overture, on, three, russian, themes, based, on, balakirev, s, folksong, overtures, as, well, as, a, fantasia, on, serbian, themes, that, was, performed, at, a, concert, given, for, the, delegates, of, the, slavonic, congress, in, 1867, in, his, review, of, this, concert, nationalist, critic, vladimir, stasov, coined, the, phrase, moguchaya, kuchka, for, the, balakirev, circle, moguchaya, kuchka, is, usually, translated, as, the, mighty, handful, or, the, five, rimsky, korsakov, also, composed, the, initial, versions, of, sadko, and, antar, which, cemented, his, reputation, as, a, writer, of, orchestral, works, rimsky, korsakov, socialized, and, discussed, music, with, the, other, members, of, the, five, they, critiqued, one, another, s, works, in, progress, and, collaborated, on, new, pieces, he, became, friends, with, alexander, borodin, whose, music, astonished, him, he, spent, an, increasing, amount, of, time, with, mussorgsky, balakirev, and, mussorgsky, played, piano, four, hand, music, mussorgsky, would, sing, and, they, frequently, discussed, other, composers, works, with, preferred, tastes, running, toward, glinka, schumann, and, beethoven, s, late, quartets, mendelssohn, was, not, thought, of, highly, mozart, and, haydn, were, considered, out, of, date, and, na, ve, and, j, s, bach, merely, mathematical, and, unfeeling, berlioz, was, highly, esteemed, liszt, crippled, and, perverted, from, a, musical, point, of, view, even, a, caricature, and, wagner, discussed, little, rimsky, korsakov, listened, to, these, opinions, with, avidity, and, absorbed, the, tastes, of, balakirev, cui, and, mussorgsky, without, reasoning, or, examination, often, the, musical, works, in, question, were, played, before, me, only, in, fragments, and, i, had, no, idea, of, the, whole, work, this, he, wrote, did, not, stop, him, from, accepting, these, judgments, at, face, value, and, repeating, them, as, if, i, were, thoroughly, convinced, of, their, truth, rimsky, korsakov, became, especially, appreciated, within, the, five, and, among, those, who, visited, the, circle, for, his, talents, as, an, orchestrator, he, was, asked, by, balakirev, to, orchestrate, a, schubert, march, for, a, concert, in, may, 1868, by, cui, to, orchestrate, the, opening, chorus, of, his, opera, william, ratcliff, and, by, alexander, dargomyzhsky, whose, works, were, greatly, appreciated, by, the, five, and, who, was, close, to, death, to, orchestrate, his, opera, the, stone, guest, in, late, 1871, rimsky, korsakov, moved, into, voin, s, former, apartment, and, invited, mussorgsky, to, be, his, roommate, the, working, arrangement, they, agreed, upon, was, that, mussorgsky, used, the, piano, in, the, mornings, while, rimsky, korsakov, worked, on, copying, or, orchestration, when, mussorgsky, left, for, his, civil, service, job, at, noon, rimsky, korsakov, then, used, the, piano, time, in, the, evenings, was, allotted, by, mutual, agreement, that, autumn, and, winter, the, two, of, us, accomplished, a, good, deal, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, with, constant, exchange, of, ideas, and, plans, mussorgsky, composed, and, orchestrated, the, polish, act, of, boris, godunov, and, the, folk, scene, near, kromy, i, orchestrated, and, finished, my, maid, of, pskov, in, 1871, the, 27, year, old, rimsky, korsakov, became, professor, of, practical, composition, and, instrumentation, orchestration, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, as, well, as, leader, of, the, orchestra, class, he, retained, his, position, in, active, naval, service, and, taught, his, classes, in, uniform, military, officers, in, russia, were, required, to, wear, their, uniforms, every, day, as, they, were, considered, to, be, always, on, duty, rimsky, korsakov, explained, in, his, memoirs, that, mikha, l, azanchevsky, had, taken, over, that, year, as, director, of, the, conservatory, and, wanting, new, blood, to, freshen, up, teaching, in, those, subjects, had, offered, to, pay, generously, for, rimsky, korsakov, s, services, biographer, mikhail, tsetlin, aka, mikhail, zetlin, suggests, that, azanchevsky, s, motives, might, have, been, twofold, first, rimsky, korsakov, was, the, member, of, the, five, least, criticized, by, its, opponents, and, inviting, him, to, teach, at, the, conservatory, may, have, been, considered, a, safe, way, to, show, that, all, serious, musicians, were, welcome, there, second, the, offer, may, have, been, calculated, to, expose, him, to, an, academic, climate, in, which, he, would, write, in, a, more, conservative, western, based, style, balakirev, had, opposed, academic, training, in, music, with, tremendous, vigor, but, encouraged, him, to, accept, the, post, to, convince, others, to, join, the, nationalist, musical, cause, rimsky, korsakov, s, reputation, at, this, time, was, as, a, master, of, orchestration, based, on, sadko, and, antar, he, had, written, these, works, mainly, by, intuition, his, knowledge, of, musical, theory, was, elemental, he, had, never, written, any, counterpoint, could, not, harmonize, a, simple, chorale, nor, knew, the, names, or, intervals, of, musical, chords, he, had, never, conducted, an, orchestra, and, had, been, discouraged, from, doing, so, by, the, navy, which, did, not, approve, of, his, appearing, on, the, podium, in, uniform, aware, of, his, technical, shortcomings, rimsky, korsakov, consulted, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, with, whom, he, and, the, others, in, the, five, had, been, in, occasional, contact, tchaikovsky, unlike, the, five, had, received, academic, training, in, composition, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, and, was, serving, as, professor, of, music, theory, at, the, moscow, conservatory, tchaikovsky, advised, him, to, study, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, while, teaching, at, the, conservatory, he, soon, became, possibly, its, very, best, pupil, judging, by, the, quantity, and, value, of, the, information, it, gave, me, to, prepare, himself, and, to, stay, at, least, one, step, ahead, of, his, students, he, took, a, three, year, sabbatical, from, composing, original, works, and, assiduously, studied, at, home, while, he, lectured, at, the, conservatory, he, taught, himself, from, textbooks, and, followed, a, strict, regimen, of, composing, contrapuntal, exercises, fugues, chorales, and, a, cappella, choruses, rimsky, korsakov, eventually, became, an, excellent, teacher, and, a, fervent, believer, in, academic, training, he, revised, everything, he, had, composed, prior, to, 1874, even, acclaimed, works, such, as, sadko, and, antar, in, a, search, for, perfection, that, would, remain, with, him, throughout, the, rest, of, his, life, assigned, to, rehearse, the, orchestra, class, he, mastered, the, art, of, conducting, dealing, with, orchestral, textures, as, a, conductor, and, making, suitable, arrangements, of, musical, works, for, the, orchestra, class, led, to, an, increased, interest, in, the, art, of, orchestration, an, area, into, which, he, would, further, indulge, his, studies, as, inspector, of, navy, bands, the, score, of, his, third, symphony, written, just, after, he, had, completed, his, three, year, program, of, self, improvement, reflects, his, hands, on, experience, with, the, orchestra, professorship, brought, rimsky, korsakov, financial, security, which, encouraged, him, to, settle, down, and, to, start, a, family, in, december, 1871, he, proposed, to, nadezhda, purgold, with, whom, he, had, developed, a, close, relationship, over, weekly, gatherings, of, the, five, at, the, purgold, household, they, married, in, july, 1872, with, mussorgsky, serving, as, best, man, the, rimsky, korsakovs, had, seven, children, their, first, son, mikhail, became, an, entomologist, while, another, son, andrei, became, a, musicologist, married, the, composer, yuliya, veysberg, and, wrote, a, multi, volume, study, of, his, father, s, life, and, work, nadezhda, became, a, musical, as, well, as, domestic, partner, with, her, husband, much, as, clara, schumann, had, been, with, her, own, husband, robert, she, was, beautiful, capable, strong, willed, and, far, better, trained, musically, than, her, husband, at, the, time, they, married, she, had, attended, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, in, the, mid, 1860s, studying, piano, with, anton, gerke, one, of, whose, private, students, was, mussorgsky, and, music, theory, with, nikolai, zaremba, who, also, taught, tchaikovsky, nadezhda, proved, a, fine, and, most, demanding, critic, of, her, husband, s, work, her, influence, over, him, in, musical, matters, was, strong, enough, for, balakirev, and, stasov, to, wonder, whether, she, was, leading, him, astray, from, their, musical, preferences, musicologist, lyle, neff, wrote, that, while, nadezhda, gave, up, her, own, compositional, career, when, she, married, rimsky, korsakov, she, had, a, considerable, influence, on, the, creation, of, first, three, operas, she, travelled, with, her, husband, attended, rehearsals, and, arranged, compositions, by, him, and, others, for, piano, four, hands, which, she, played, with, her, husband, her, last, years, were, dedicated, to, issuing, her, husband, s, posthumous, literary, and, musical, legacy, maintaining, standards, for, performance, of, his, works, and, preparing, material, for, a, museum, in, his, name, in, early, 1873, the, navy, created, the, civilian, post, of, inspector, of, naval, bands, with, a, rank, of, collegiate, assessor, and, appointed, rimsky, korsakov, this, kept, him, on, the, navy, payroll, and, listed, on, the, roster, of, the, chancellery, of, the, navy, department, but, allowed, him, to, resign, his, commission, the, composer, commented, i, parted, with, delight, with, both, my, military, status, and, my, officer, s, uniform, he, later, wrote, henceforth, i, was, a, musician, officially, and, incontestably, as, inspector, rimsky, korsakov, applied, himself, with, zeal, to, his, duties, he, visited, naval, bands, throughout, russia, supervised, the, bandmasters, and, their, appointments, reviewed, the, bands, repertoire, and, inspected, the, quality, of, their, instruments, he, wrote, a, study, program, for, a, complement, of, music, students, who, held, navy, fellowships, at, the, conservatory, and, acted, as, an, intermediary, between, the, conservatory, and, the, navy, he, also, indulged, in, a, long, standing, desire, to, familiarize, himself, with, the, construction, and, playing, technique, of, orchestral, instruments, these, studies, prompted, him, to, write, a, textbook, on, orchestration, he, used, the, privileges, of, rank, to, exercise, and, expand, upon, his, knowledge, he, discussed, arrangements, of, musical, works, for, military, band, with, bandmasters, encouraged, and, reviewed, their, efforts, held, concerts, at, which, he, could, hear, these, pieces, and, orchestrated, original, works, and, works, by, other, composers, for, military, bands, in, march, 1884, an, imperial, order, abolished, the, navy, office, of, inspector, of, bands, and, rimsky, korsakov, was, relieved, of, his, duties, he, worked, under, balakirev, in, the, court, chapel, as, a, deputy, until, 1894, which, allowed, him, to, study, russian, orthodox, church, music, he, also, taught, classes, at, the, chapel, and, wrote, his, textbook, on, harmony, for, use, there, and, at, the, conservatory, rimsky, korsakov, s, studies, and, his, change, in, attitude, regarding, music, education, brought, him, the, scorn, of, his, fellow, nationalists, who, thought, he, was, throwing, away, his, russian, heritage, to, compose, fugues, and, sonatas, after, he, strove, to, crowd, in, as, much, counterpoint, as, possible, into, his, third, symphony, he, wrote, chamber, works, adhering, strictly, to, classical, models, including, a, string, sextet, a, string, quartet, in, f, major, op, 12, and, a, quintet, for, flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon, and, piano, in, b, flat, about, the, quartet, and, the, symphony, tchaikovsky, wrote, to, his, patroness, nadezhda, von, meck, that, they, were, filled, with, a, host, of, clever, things, but, imbued, with, a, dryly, pedantic, character, borodin, commented, that, when, he, heard, the, symphony, he, kept, feeling, that, this, is, the, work, of, a, german, herr, professor, who, has, put, on, his, glasses, and, is, about, to, write, eine, grosse, symphonie, in, c, according, to, rimsky, korsakov, the, other, members, of, the, five, showed, little, enthusiasm, for, the, symphony, and, less, still, for, the, quartet, nor, was, his, public, debut, as, a, conductor, at, an, 1874, charity, concert, where, he, led, the, orchestra, in, the, new, symphony, considered, favorably, by, his, compatriots, he, later, wrote, that, they, began, indeed, to, look, down, upon, me, as, one, on, the, downward, path, worse, still, to, rimsky, korsakov, was, the, faint, praise, given, by, anton, rubinstein, a, composer, opposed, to, the, nationalists, music, and, philosophy, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, after, rubinstein, heard, the, quartet, he, commented, that, now, rimsky, korsakov, might, amount, to, something, as, a, composer, he, wrote, that, tchaikovsky, continued, to, support, him, morally, telling, him, that, he, fully, applauded, what, rimsky, korsakov, was, doing, and, admired, both, his, artistic, modesty, and, his, strength, of, character, privately, tchaikovsky, confided, to, nadezhda, von, meck, apparently, is, now, passing, through, this, crisis, and, how, it, will, end, will, be, difficult, to, predict, either, a, great, master, will, come, out, of, him, or, he, will, finally, become, bogged, down, in, contrapuntal, tricks, two, projects, helped, rimsky, korsakov, focus, on, less, academic, music, making, the, first, was, the, creation, of, two, folk, song, collections, in, 1874, rimsky, korsakov, transcribed, 40, russian, songs, for, voice, and, piano, from, performances, by, folk, singer, tvorty, filippov, who, approached, him, at, balakirev, s, suggestion, this, collection, was, followed, by, a, second, containing, 100, songs, supplied, by, friends, and, servants, or, taken, from, rare, and, out, of, print, collections, rimsky, korsakov, later, credited, this, work, as, a, great, influence, on, him, as, a, composer, it, also, supplied, a, vast, amount, of, musical, material, from, which, he, could, draw, for, future, projects, either, by, direct, quotation, or, as, models, for, composing, fakeloric, passages, the, second, project, was, the, editing, of, orchestral, scores, by, pioneer, russian, composer, mikhail, glinka, 1804, 1857, in, collaboration, with, balakirev, and, anatoly, lyadov, glinka, s, sister, lyudmila, ivanovna, shestakova, wanted, to, preserve, her, brother, s, musical, legacy, in, print, and, paid, the, costs, of, the, project, from, her, own, pocket, no, similar, project, had, been, attempted, before, in, russian, music, and, guidelines, for, scholarly, musical, editing, had, to, be, established, and, agreed, while, balakirev, favored, making, changes, in, glinka, s, music, to, correct, what, he, saw, as, compositional, flaws, rimsky, korsakov, favored, a, less, intrusive, approach, eventually, rimsky, korsakov, prevailed, work, on, glinka, s, scores, was, an, unexpected, schooling, for, me, he, later, wrote, even, before, this, i, had, known, and, worshipped, his, operas, but, as, editor, of, the, scores, in, print, i, had, to, go, through, glinka, s, style, and, instrumentation, to, their, last, little, note, and, this, was, a, beneficent, discipline, for, me, leading, me, as, it, did, to, the, path, of, modern, music, after, my, vicissitudes, with, counterpoint, and, strict, style, in, mid, 1877, rimsky, korsakov, thought, increasingly, about, the, short, story, may, night, by, nikolai, gogol, the, story, had, long, been, a, favorite, of, his, and, his, wife, nadezhda, had, encouraged, him, to, write, an, opera, based, on, it, from, the, day, of, their, betrothal, when, they, had, read, it, together, while, musical, ideas, for, such, a, work, predated, 1877, now, they, came, with, greater, persistence, by, early, 1878, the, project, took, an, increasing, amount, of, his, attention, in, february, he, started, writing, in, earnest, and, he, finished, the, opera, by, early, november, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, may, night, was, of, great, importance, because, despite, the, opera, s, containing, a, good, deal, of, contrapuntal, music, he, nevertheless, cast, off, the, shackles, of, counterpoint, he, wrote, the, opera, in, a, folk, like, melodic, idiom, and, scored, it, in, a, transparent, manner, much, in, the, style, of, glinka, nevertheless, despite, the, ease, of, writing, this, opera, and, the, next, the, snow, maiden, from, time, to, time, he, suffered, from, creative, paralysis, between, 1881, and, 1888, he, kept, busy, during, this, time, by, editing, mussorgsky, s, works, and, completing, borodin, s, prince, igor, mussorgsky, died, in, 1881, borodin, in, 1887, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, he, became, acquainted, with, budding, music, patron, mitrofan, belyayev, m, p, belaieff, in, moscow, in, 1882, belyayev, was, one, of, a, growing, coterie, of, russian, nouveau, riche, industrialists, who, became, patrons, of, the, arts, in, mid, to, late, 19th, century, russia, their, number, included, railway, magnate, savva, mamontov, and, textile, manufacturer, pavel, tretyakov, belyayev, mamontov, and, tretyakov, wanted, to, contribute, conspicuously, to, public, life, they, had, worked, their, way, into, wealth, and, being, slavophiles, in, their, national, outlook, believed, in, the, greater, glory, of, russia, owing, to, this, belief, they, were, more, likely, than, the, aristocracy, to, support, native, talent, and, were, more, inclined, to, support, nationalist, artists, over, cosmopolitan, ones, this, preference, paralleled, a, general, upsurge, in, nationalism, and, russophilia, that, became, prevalent, in, mainstream, russian, art, and, society, by, 1883, rimsky, korsakov, had, become, a, regular, visitor, to, the, weekly, quartet, fridays, les, vendredis, held, at, belyayev, s, home, in, saint, petersburg, belyayev, who, had, already, taken, a, keen, interest, in, the, musical, future, of, the, teenage, alexander, glazunov, rented, a, hall, and, hired, an, orchestra, in, 1884, to, play, glazunov, s, first, symphony, plus, an, orchestral, suite, glazunov, had, just, composed, this, concert, and, a, rehearsal, the, previous, year, gave, rimsky, korsakov, the, idea, of, offering, concerts, featuring, russian, compositions, a, prospect, to, which, belyayev, was, amenable, the, russian, symphony, concerts, were, inaugurated, during, the, 1886, 87, season, with, rimsky, korsakov, sharing, conducting, duties, with, anatoly, lyadov, he, finished, his, revision, of, mussorgsky, s, night, on, bald, mountain, and, conducted, it, at, the, opening, concert, the, concerts, also, coaxed, him, out, of, his, creative, drought, he, wrote, scheherazade, capriccio, espagnol, and, the, russian, easter, overture, specifically, for, them, he, noted, that, these, three, works, show, a, considerable, falling, off, in, the, use, of, contrapuntal, devices, by, a, strong, and, virtuoso, development, of, every, kind, of, figuration, which, sustains, the, technical, interest, of, my, compositions, rimsky, korsakov, was, asked, for, advice, and, guidance, not, just, on, the, russian, symphony, concerts, but, on, other, projects, through, which, belyayev, aided, russian, composers, by, force, of, matters, purely, musical, i, turned, out, to, be, the, head, of, the, belyayev, circle, he, wrote, as, the, head, belyayev, too, considered, me, consulting, me, about, everything, and, referring, everyone, to, me, as, chief, in, 1884, belyayev, set, up, an, annual, glinka, prize, and, in, 1885, he, founded, his, own, music, publishing, firm, through, which, he, published, works, by, borodin, glazunov, lyadov, and, rimsky, korsakov, at, his, own, expense, to, select, which, composers, to, assist, with, money, publication, or, performances, from, the, many, who, now, appealed, for, help, belyayev, set, up, an, advisory, council, made, up, of, glazunov, lyadov, and, rimsky, korsakov, they, would, look, through, the, compositions, and, appeals, submitted, and, suggest, which, composers, were, deserving, of, patronage, and, public, attention, the, group, of, composers, who, now, congregated, with, glazunov, lyadov, and, rimsky, korsakov, became, known, as, the, belyayev, circle, named, after, their, financial, benefactor, these, composers, were, nationalistic, in, their, musical, outlook, as, the, five, before, them, had, been, like, the, five, they, believed, in, a, uniquely, russian, style, of, classical, music, that, utilized, folk, music, and, exotic, melodic, harmonic, and, rhythmic, elements, as, exemplified, by, the, music, of, balakirev, borodin, and, rimsky, korsakov, unlike, the, five, these, composers, also, believed, in, the, necessity, of, an, academic, western, based, background, in, composition, which, rimsky, korsakov, had, instilled, in, his, years, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, compared, to, the, revolutionary, composers, in, balakirev, s, circle, rimsky, korsakov, found, those, in, the, belyayev, circle, to, be, progressive, attaching, as, it, did, great, importance, to, technical, perfection, but, also, broke, new, paths, though, more, securely, even, if, less, speedily, in, november, 1887, tchaikovsky, arrived, in, saint, petersburg, in, time, to, hear, several, of, the, russian, symphony, concerts, one, of, them, included, the, first, complete, performance, of, his, first, symphony, subtitled, winter, daydreams, in, its, final, version, another, concert, featured, the, premiere, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, third, symphony, in, its, revised, version, rimsky, korsakov, and, tchaikovsky, corresponded, considerably, before, the, visit, and, spent, a, lot, of, time, together, along, with, glazunov, and, lyadov, though, tchaikovsky, had, been, a, regular, visitor, to, the, rimsky, korsakov, home, since, 1876, and, had, at, one, point, offered, to, arrange, rimsky, korsakov, s, appointment, as, director, of, the, moscow, conservatory, this, was, the, beginning, of, closer, relations, between, the, two, within, a, couple, of, years, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, tchaikovsky, s, visits, became, more, frequent, during, these, visits, and, especially, in, public, rimsky, korsakov, wore, a, mask, of, geniality, privately, he, found, the, situation, emotionally, complex, and, confessed, his, fears, to, his, friend, the, moscow, critic, semyon, kruglikov, memories, persisted, of, the, tension, between, tchaikovsky, and, the, five, over, the, differences, in, their, musical, philosophies, tension, acute, enough, for, tchaikovsky, s, brother, modest, to, liken, their, relations, at, that, time, to, those, between, two, friendly, neighboring, states, cautiously, prepared, to, meet, on, common, ground, but, jealously, guarding, their, separate, interests, rimsky, korsakov, observed, not, without, annoyance, how, tchaikovsky, became, increasingly, popular, among, rimsky, korsakov, s, followers, this, personal, jealousy, was, compounded, by, a, professional, one, as, tchaikovsky, s, music, became, increasingly, popular, among, the, composers, of, the, belyayev, circle, and, remained, on, the, whole, more, famous, than, his, own, even, so, when, tchaikovsky, attended, rimsky, korsakov, s, nameday, party, in, may, 1893, rimsky, korsakov, asked, tchaikovsky, personally, if, he, would, conduct, four, concerts, of, the, russian, musical, society, in, saint, petersburg, the, following, season, after, hesitation, tchaikovsky, agreed, while, his, sudden, death, in, late, 1893, prevented, him, from, fulfilling, this, commitment, in, its, entirety, the, list, of, works, he, had, planned, to, conduct, included, rimsky, korsakov, s, third, symphony, in, march, 1889, angelo, neumann, s, traveling, richard, wagner, theater, visited, saint, petersburg, giving, four, cycles, of, der, ring, des, nibelungen, there, under, the, direction, of, karl, muck, the, five, had, ignored, wagner, s, music, but, the, ring, impressed, rimsky, korsakov, he, was, astonished, with, wagner, s, mastery, of, orchestration, he, attended, the, rehearsals, with, glazunov, and, followed, the, score, after, hearing, these, performances, rimsky, korsakov, devoted, himself, almost, exclusively, to, composing, operas, for, the, rest, of, his, creative, life, wagner, s, use, of, the, orchestra, influenced, rimsky, korsakov, s, orchestration, beginning, with, the, arrangement, of, the, polonaise, from, mussorgsky, s, boris, godunov, that, he, made, for, concert, use, in, 1889, toward, music, more, adventurous, than, wagner, s, especially, that, of, richard, strauss, and, later, claude, debussy, rimsky, korsakov, s, mind, remained, closed, he, would, fume, for, days, afterwards, when, he, heard, pianist, felix, blumenfeld, play, debussy, s, estampes, and, write, in, his, diary, about, them, poor, and, skimpy, to, the, nth, degree, there, is, no, technique, even, less, imagination, this, was, part, of, an, increasing, musical, conservatism, on, his, part, his, musical, conscience, as, he, put, it, under, which, he, now, scrutinized, his, music, and, that, of, others, as, well, compositions, by, his, former, compatriots, in, the, five, were, not, immune, while, working, on, his, first, revision, of, mussorgsky, s, boris, godunov, in, 1895, he, would, tell, his, amanuensis, vasily, yastrebtsev, it, s, incredible, that, i, ever, could, have, liked, this, music, and, yet, it, seems, there, was, such, a, time, by, 1901, he, would, write, of, growing, indignant, at, all, blunders, of, the, ear, this, about, the, same, music, which, caught, his, attention, in, 1889, in, 1892, rimsky, korsakov, suffered, a, second, creative, drought, brought, on, by, bouts, of, depression, and, alarming, physical, symptoms, rushes, of, blood, to, the, head, confusion, memory, loss, and, unpleasant, obsessions, led, to, a, medical, diagnosis, of, neurasthenia, crises, in, the, rimsky, korsakov, household, may, have, been, a, factor, the, serious, illnesses, of, his, wife, and, one, of, his, sons, from, diphtheria, in, 1890, the, deaths, of, his, mother, and, youngest, child, as, well, as, the, onset, of, the, prolonged, ultimately, fatal, illness, of, his, second, youngest, child, he, resigned, from, the, russian, symphony, concerts, and, the, court, chapel, and, considered, giving, up, composition, permanently, after, making, third, versions, of, the, musical, tableau, sadko, and, the, opera, the, maid, of, pskov, he, closed, his, musical, account, with, the, past, he, had, left, none, of, his, major, works, before, may, night, in, their, original, form, another, death, brought, about, a, creative, renewal, the, passing, of, tchaikovsky, presented, a, twofold, opportunity, to, write, for, the, imperial, theaters, and, to, compose, an, opera, based, on, nikolai, gogol, s, short, story, christmas, eve, a, work, on, which, tchaikovsky, had, based, his, opera, vakula, the, smith, the, success, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, christmas, eve, encouraged, him, to, complete, an, opera, approximately, every, 18, months, between, 1893, and, 1908, a, total, of, 11, during, this, period, he, also, started, and, abandoned, another, draft, of, his, treatise, on, orchestration, but, made, a, third, attempt, and, almost, finished, it, in, the, last, four, years, of, his, life, his, son, in, law, maximilian, steinberg, completed, the, book, in, 1912, rimsky, korsakov, s, scientific, treatment, of, orchestration, illustrated, with, more, than, 300, examples, from, his, work, set, a, new, standard, for, texts, of, its, kind, in, 1905, demonstrations, took, place, in, the, st, petersburg, conservatory, as, part, of, the, 1905, revolution, these, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, were, triggered, by, similar, disturbances, at, st, petersburg, state, university, in, which, students, demanded, political, reforms, and, the, establishment, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, in, russia, i, was, chosen, a, member, of, the, committee, for, adjusting, differences, with, agitated, pupils, he, recalled, almost, as, soon, as, the, committee, had, been, formed, ll, sorts, of, measures, were, recommended, to, expel, the, ringleaders, to, quarter, the, police, in, the, conservatory, to, close, the, conservatory, entirely, a, lifelong, liberal, politically, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, he, felt, someone, had, to, protect, the, rights, of, the, students, to, demonstrate, especially, as, disputes, and, wrangling, between, students, and, authorities, were, becoming, increasingly, violent, in, an, open, letter, he, sided, with, the, students, against, what, he, saw, as, unwarranted, interference, by, conservatory, leadership, and, the, russian, musical, society, a, second, letter, this, time, signed, by, a, number, of, faculty, including, rimsky, korsakov, demanded, the, resignation, of, the, head, of, the, conservatory, partly, as, a, result, of, these, two, letters, he, wrote, approximately, 100, conservatory, students, were, expelled, and, he, was, removed, from, his, professorship, just, before, the, dismissal, was, enacted, rimsky, korsakov, received, a, letter, from, one, of, the, members, of, the, school, directorate, suggesting, that, he, take, up, the, directorship, in, the, interest, of, calming, student, unrest, probably, the, member, of, the, directorate, held, a, minority, opinion, but, signed, the, resolution, nevertheless, he, wrote, i, sent, a, negative, reply, partly, in, defiance, of, his, dismissal, rimsky, korsakov, continued, teaching, his, students, from, his, home, not, long, after, rimsky, korsakov, s, dismissal, a, student, production, of, his, opera, kashchey, the, immortal, was, followed, not, with, the, scheduled, concert, but, with, a, political, demonstration, which, led, to, a, police, ban, on, rimsky, korsakov, s, work, due, in, part, to, widespread, press, coverage, of, these, events, an, immediate, wave, of, outrage, against, the, ban, arose, throughout, russia, and, abroad, liberals, and, intellectuals, deluged, the, composer, s, residence, with, letters, of, sympathy, and, even, peasants, who, had, not, heard, a, note, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, music, sent, small, monetary, donations, several, faculty, members, of, the, st, petersburg, conservatory, resigned, in, protest, including, glazunov, and, lyadov, eventually, over, 300, students, walked, out, of, the, conservatory, in, solidarity, with, rimsky, korsakov, by, december, he, had, been, reinstated, under, a, new, director, glazunov, rimsky, korsakov, retired, from, the, conservatory, in, 1906, the, political, controversy, continued, with, his, opera, the, golden, cockerel, its, implied, criticism, of, monarchy, russian, imperialism, and, the, russo, japanese, war, gave, it, little, chance, of, passing, the, censors, the, premiere, was, delayed, until, 1909, after, rimsky, korsakov, s, death, and, even, then, it, was, performed, in, an, adapted, version, in, april, 1907, rimsky, korsakov, conducted, a, pair, of, concerts, in, paris, hosted, by, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, which, featured, music, of, the, russian, nationalist, school, the, concerts, were, hugely, successful, in, popularizing, russian, classical, music, of, this, kind, in, europe, rimsky, korsakov, s, in, particular, the, following, year, his, opera, sadko, was, produced, at, the, paris, op, ra, and, the, snow, maiden, at, the, op, ra, comique, he, also, had, the, opportunity, to, hear, more, recent, music, by, european, composers, he, hissed, unabashedly, when, he, heard, richard, strauss, s, opera, salome, and, told, diaghilev, after, hearing, claude, debussy, s, opera, pell, as, et, m, lisande, don, t, make, me, listen, to, all, these, horrors, or, i, shall, end, up, liking, them, hearing, these, works, led, him, to, appreciate, his, place, in, the, world, of, classical, music, he, admitted, that, he, was, a, convinced, kuchkist, after, kuchka, the, shortened, russian, term, for, the, five, and, that, his, works, belonged, to, an, era, that, musical, trends, had, left, behind, beginning, around, 1890, rimsky, korsakov, suffered, from, angina, while, this, ailment, initially, wore, him, down, gradually, the, stresses, concurrent, with, the, 1905, revolution, and, its, aftermath, greatly, accelerated, its, progress, after, december, 1907, his, illness, became, severe, and, he, could, not, work, in, 1908, he, died, at, his, lubensk, estate, near, luga, modern, day, plyussky, district, of, pskov, oblast, and, was, interred, in, tikhvin, cemetery, at, the, alexander, nevsky, monastery, in, saint, petersburg, next, to, borodin, glinka, mussorgsky, and, stasov, rimsky, korsakov, followed, the, musical, ideals, espoused, by, the, five, he, employed, orthodox, liturgical, themes, in, the, russian, easter, festival, overture, folk, song, in, capriccio, espagnol, and, orientalism, in, scheherazade, possibly, his, best, known, work, he, proved, a, prolific, composer, but, also, a, perpetually, self, critical, one, he, revised, every, orchestral, work, up, to, and, including, his, third, symphony, some, like, antar, and, sadko, more, than, once, these, revisions, range, from, minor, changes, of, tempo, phrasing, and, instrumental, detail, to, wholesale, transposition, and, complete, recomposition, rimsky, korsakov, was, open, about, the, influences, in, his, music, telling, vasily, yastrebtsev, study, liszt, and, balakirev, more, closely, and, you, ll, see, that, a, great, deal, in, me, is, not, mine, he, followed, balakirev, in, his, use, of, the, whole, tone, scale, treatment, of, folk, songs, and, musical, orientalism, and, liszt, for, harmonic, adventurousness, the, violin, melody, used, to, portray, scheherazade, is, very, closely, related, to, its, counterpart, in, balakirev, s, symphonic, poem, tamara, while, the, russian, easter, overtures, follows, the, design, and, plan, of, balakirev, s, second, overture, on, russian, themes, nevertheless, while, he, took, glinka, and, liszt, as, his, harmonic, models, his, use, of, whole, tone, and, octatonic, scales, do, demonstrate, his, originality, he, developed, both, these, compositional, devices, for, the, fantastic, sections, of, his, operas, which, depicted, magical, or, supernatural, characters, and, events, rimsky, korsakov, maintained, an, interest, in, harmonic, experiments, and, continued, exploring, new, idioms, throughout, his, career, he, tempered, this, interest, with, an, abhorrence, of, excess, and, kept, his, tendency, to, experiment, under, constant, control, the, more, radical, his, harmonies, became, the, more, he, attempted, to, control, them, with, strict, rules, applying, his, musical, conscience, as, he, called, it, in, this, sense, he, was, both, a, progressive, and, a, conservative, composer, the, whole, tone, and, octatonic, scales, were, both, considered, adventurous, in, the, western, classical, tradition, and, rimsky, korsakov, s, use, of, them, made, his, harmonies, seem, radical, conversely, his, care, about, how, or, when, in, a, composition, he, used, these, scales, made, him, seem, conservative, compared, with, later, composers, like, igor, stravinsky, though, they, were, often, building, on, rimsky, korsakov, s, work, while, rimsky, korsakov, is, best, known, in, the, west, for, his, orchestral, works, his, operas, are, more, complex, offering, a, wider, variety, of, orchestral, effects, than, in, his, instrumental, works, and, fine, vocal, writing, excerpts, and, suites, from, them, have, proved, as, popular, in, the, west, as, the, purely, orchestral, works, the, best, known, of, these, excerpts, is, probably, flight, of, the, bumblebee, from, the, tale, of, tsar, saltan, which, has, often, been, heard, by, itself, in, orchestral, programs, and, in, countless, arrangements, and, transcriptions, most, famously, in, a, piano, version, made, by, russian, composer, sergei, rachmaninoff, other, selections, familiar, to, listeners, in, the, west, are, dance, of, the, tumblers, from, the, snow, maiden, procession, of, the, nobles, from, mlada, and, song, of, the, indian, guest, or, less, accurately, song, of, india, from, sadko, as, well, as, suites, from, the, golden, cockerel, and, the, legend, of, the, invisible, city, of, kitezh, and, the, maiden, fevroniya, the, operas, fall, into, three, categories, of, this, range, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, in, 1902, in, every, new, work, of, mine, i, am, trying, to, do, something, that, is, new, for, me, on, the, one, hand, i, am, pushed, on, by, the, thought, that, in, this, way, will, retain, freshness, and, interest, but, at, the, same, time, i, am, prompted, by, my, pride, to, think, that, many, facets, devices, moods, and, styles, if, not, all, should, be, within, my, reach, among, his, operatic, works, rimsky, korsakov, s, snegurochka, also, known, as, the, snow, maiden, sums, up, his, compositional, character, the, snow, maiden, is, a, character, who, is, the, personification, of, love, and, passion, and, yet, she, melts, in, the, first, rays, of, the, sun, rimsky, korsakov, s, works, mirror, the, snow, maiden, as, they, are, exquisite, but, can, quickly, turn, cold, and, pellucid, and, dissolve, at, the, touch, of, the, living, language, of, passion, american, music, critic, and, journalist, harold, c, schonberg, wrote, that, the, operas, open, up, a, delightful, new, world, the, world, of, the, russian, east, the, world, of, supernaturalism, and, the, exotic, the, world, of, slavic, pantheism, and, vanished, races, genuine, poetry, suffuses, them, and, they, are, scored, with, brilliance, and, resource, according, to, some, critics, rimsky, korsakov, s, music, in, these, works, lacks, dramatic, power, a, seemingly, fatal, flaw, in, an, operatic, composer, this, may, have, been, conscious, as, he, repeatedly, stated, in, his, writing, that, he, felt, operas, were, first, and, foremost, musical, works, rather, than, mainly, dramatic, ones, ironically, the, operas, succeed, dramatically, in, most, cases, by, being, deliberately, non, theatrical, the, purely, orchestral, works, fall, into, two, categories, the, best, known, ones, in, the, west, and, perhaps, the, finest, in, overall, quality, are, mainly, programmatic, in, nature, in, other, words, the, musical, content, and, how, it, is, handled, in, the, piece, is, determined, by, the, plot, or, characters, in, a, story, the, action, in, a, painting, or, events, reported, through, another, non, musical, source, the, second, category, of, works, is, more, academic, such, as, his, first, and, third, symphonies, and, his, sinfonietta, in, these, rimsky, korsakov, still, employed, folk, themes, but, subjected, them, to, abstract, rules, of, musical, composition, program, music, came, naturally, to, rimsky, korsakov, to, him, even, a, folk, theme, has, a, program, of, sorts, he, composed, the, majority, of, his, orchestral, works, in, this, genre, at, two, periods, of, his, career, at, the, beginning, with, sadko, and, antar, also, known, as, his, second, symphony, op, 9, and, in, the, 1880s, with, scheherazade, capriccio, espagnol, and, the, russian, easter, overture, despite, the, gap, between, these, two, periods, the, composer, s, overall, approach, and, the, way, he, used, his, musical, themes, remained, consistent, both, antar, and, scheherazade, use, a, robust, russian, theme, to, portray, the, male, protagonists, the, title, character, in, antar, the, sultan, in, scheherazade, and, a, more, sinuous, eastern, theme, for, the, female, ones, the, peri, gul, nazar, in, antar, and, the, title, character, in, scheherazade, where, rimsky, korsakov, changed, between, these, two, sets, of, works, was, in, orchestration, while, his, pieces, were, always, celebrated, for, their, imaginative, use, of, instrumental, forces, the, sparser, textures, of, sadko, and, antar, pale, compared, to, the, luxuriance, of, the, more, popular, works, of, the, 1880s, while, a, principle, of, highlighting, primary, hues, of, instrumental, color, remained, in, place, it, was, augmented, in, the, later, works, by, a, sophisticated, cachet, of, orchestral, effects, some, gleaned, from, other, composers, including, wagner, but, many, invented, by, himself, as, a, result, these, works, resemble, brightly, colored, mosaics, striking, in, their, own, right, and, often, scored, with, a, juxtaposition, of, pure, orchestral, groups, the, final, tutti, of, scheherazade, is, a, prime, example, of, this, scoring, the, theme, is, assigned, to, trombones, playing, in, unison, and, is, accompanied, by, a, combination, of, string, patterns, meanwhile, another, pattern, alternates, with, chromatic, scales, in, the, woodwinds, and, a, third, pattern, of, rhythms, is, played, by, percussion, rimsky, korsakov, s, non, program, music, though, well, crafted, does, not, rise, to, the, same, level, of, inspiration, as, his, programmatic, works, he, needed, fantasy, to, bring, out, the, best, in, him, the, first, symphony, follows, the, outlines, of, schumann, s, fourth, extremely, closely, and, is, slighter, in, its, thematic, material, than, his, later, compositions, the, third, symphony, and, sinfonietta, each, contain, a, series, of, variations, on, less, than, the, best, music, that, can, lead, to, tedium, rimsky, korsakov, composed, dozens, of, art, songs, arrangements, of, folk, songs, chamber, and, piano, music, while, the, piano, music, is, relatively, unimportant, many, of, the, art, songs, possess, a, delicate, beauty, while, they, yield, in, overt, lyricism, to, tchaikovsky, and, rachmaninoff, otherwise, they, reserve, their, place, in, the, standard, repertory, of, russian, singers, rimsky, korsakov, also, wrote, a, body, of, choral, works, both, secular, and, for, russian, orthodox, church, service, the, latter, include, settings, of, portions, of, the, liturgy, of, st, john, chrysostom, despite, his, own, atheism, the, critic, vladimir, stasov, who, along, with, balakirev, had, founded, the, five, wrote, in, 1882, beginning, with, glinka, all, the, best, russian, musicians, have, been, very, skeptical, of, book, learning, and, have, never, approached, it, with, the, servility, and, the, superstitious, reverence, with, which, it, is, approached, to, this, day, in, many, parts, of, europe, this, statement, was, not, true, for, glinka, who, studied, western, music, theory, assiduously, with, siegfried, dehn, in, berlin, before, he, composed, his, opera, a, life, for, the, tsar, it, was, true, for, balakirev, who, opposed, academicism, with, tremendous, vigor, and, it, was, true, initially, for, rimsky, korsakov, who, had, been, imbued, by, balakirev, and, stasov, with, the, same, attitude, one, point, stasov, omitted, purposely, which, would, have, disproved, his, statement, completely, was, that, at, the, time, he, wrote, it, rimsky, korsakov, had, been, pouring, his, book, learning, into, students, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, for, over, a, decade, beginning, with, his, three, years, of, self, imposed, study, rimsky, korsakov, had, drawn, closer, to, tchaikovsky, and, further, away, from, the, rest, of, the, five, while, the, rest, of, the, five, had, drawn, back, from, him, and, stasov, had, branded, him, a, renegade, richard, taruskin, wrote, the, older, he, became, the, greater, was, the, irony, with, which, rimsky, korsakov, looked, back, on, his, kuchkist, days, when, the, young, semyon, kruglikov, was, considering, a, future, in, composition, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, the, future, critic, about, a, talent, for, composition, i, can, say, nothing, as, yet, you, have, tried, your, powers, too, little, yes, one, can, study, on, one, s, own, sometimes, one, needs, advice, but, one, must, study, all, of, us, that, is, i, myself, and, borodin, and, balakirev, and, especially, cui, and, mussorgsky, did, disdain, these, things, i, consider, myself, lucky, that, i, bethought, myself, in, time, and, forced, myself, to, work, as, for, balakirev, owing, to, his, insufficient, technique, he, writes, little, borodin, with, difficulty, cui, carelessly, and, mussorgsky, sloppily, and, often, incoherently, taruskin, points, out, this, statement, which, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, while, borodin, and, mussorgsky, were, still, alive, as, proof, of, his, estrangement, from, the, rest, of, the, five, and, an, indication, of, the, kind, of, teacher, he, eventually, became, by, the, time, he, instructed, liadov, and, glazunov, their, training, hardly, differed, from, an, ideal, of, the, strictest, professionalism, was, instilled, in, them, from, the, beginning, by, the, time, borodin, died, in, 1887, the, era, of, autodidactism, for, russian, composers, had, effectively, ended, every, russian, who, aspired, to, write, classical, music, attended, a, conservatory, and, received, the, same, formal, education, there, was, no, more, moscow, no, st, petersburg, taruskin, writes, at, last, all, russia, was, one, moreover, by, century, s, end, the, theory, and, composition, faculties, of, rubinstein, s, conservatory, were, entirely, in, the, hands, of, representatives, of, the, new, russian, school, viewed, against, the, background, of, stasov, s, predictions, there, could, scarcely, be, any, greater, irony, rimsky, korsakov, taught, theory, and, composition, to, 250, students, over, his, 35, year, tenure, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, enough, to, people, a, whole, school, of, composers, this, does, not, include, pupils, at, the, two, other, schools, where, he, taught, including, glazunov, or, those, he, taught, privately, at, his, home, such, as, igor, stravinsky, apart, from, glazunov, and, stravinsky, students, who, later, found, fame, included, anatoly, lyadov, mikhail, ippolitov, ivanov, alexander, spendiaryan, sergei, prokofiev, ottorino, respighi, witold, maliszewski, mykola, lysenko, artur, kapp, and, konstanty, gorski, other, students, included, the, music, critic, and, musicologist, alexander, ossovsky, and, the, composer, lazare, saminsky, rimsky, korsakov, felt, talented, students, needed, little, formal, dictated, instruction, his, teaching, method, included, distinct, steps, show, the, students, everything, needed, in, harmony, and, counterpoint, direct, them, in, understanding, the, forms, of, composition, give, them, a, year, or, two, of, systematic, study, in, the, development, of, technique, exercises, in, free, composition, and, orchestration, instill, a, good, knowledge, of, the, piano, once, these, were, properly, completed, studies, would, be, over, he, carried, this, attitude, into, his, conservatory, classes, conductor, nikolai, malko, remembered, that, rimsky, korsakov, began, the, first, class, of, the, term, by, saying, i, will, speak, and, you, will, listen, then, i, will, speak, less, and, you, will, start, to, work, and, finally, i, will, not, speak, at, all, and, you, will, work, malko, added, that, his, class, followed, exactly, this, pattern, rimsky, korsakov, explained, everything, so, clearly, and, simply, that, all, we, had, to, do, was, to, do, our, work, well, rimsky, korsakov, s, editing, of, works, by, the, five, is, significant, it, was, a, practical, extension, of, the, collaborative, atmosphere, of, the, five, during, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, when, they, heard, each, other, s, compositions, in, progress, and, worked, on, them, together, and, was, an, effort, to, save, works, that, would, otherwise, either, have, languished, unheard, or, become, lost, entirely, this, work, included, the, completion, of, alexander, borodin, s, opera, prince, igor, which, rimsky, korsakov, undertook, with, the, help, of, glazunov, after, borodin, s, death, and, the, orchestration, of, passages, from, c, sar, cui, s, william, ratcliff, for, its, first, production, in, 1869, he, also, completely, orchestrated, the, opera, the, stone, guest, by, alexander, dargomyzhsky, three, times, in, 1869, 70, 1892, and, 1902, while, not, a, member, of, the, five, himself, dargomyzhsky, was, closely, associated, with, the, group, and, shared, their, musical, philosophy, musicologist, francis, maes, wrote, that, while, rimsky, korsakov, s, efforts, are, laudable, they, are, also, controversial, it, was, generally, assumed, that, with, prince, igor, rimsky, korsakov, edited, and, orchestrated, the, existing, fragments, of, the, opera, while, glazunov, composed, and, added, missing, parts, including, most, of, the, third, act, and, the, overture, this, was, exactly, what, rimsky, korsakov, stated, in, his, memoirs, both, maes, and, richard, taruskin, cite, an, analysis, of, borodin, s, manuscripts, by, musicologist, pavel, lamm, which, showed, that, rimsky, korsakov, and, glazunov, discarded, nearly, 20, percent, of, borodin, s, score, according, to, maes, the, result, is, more, a, collaborative, effort, by, all, three, composers, than, a, true, representation, of, borodin, s, intent, lamm, stated, that, because, of, the, extremely, chaotic, state, of, borodin, s, manuscripts, a, modern, alternative, to, rimsky, korsakov, and, glazunov, s, edition, would, be, extremely, difficult, to, complete, more, debatable, according, to, maes, is, rimsky, korsakov, s, editing, of, mussorgsky, s, works, after, mussorgsky, s, death, in, 1881, rimsky, korsakov, revised, and, completed, several, of, mussorgsky, s, works, for, publication, and, performance, helping, to, spread, mussorgsky, s, works, throughout, russia, and, to, the, west, maes, in, reviewing, mussorgsky, s, scores, wrote, that, rimsky, korsakov, allowed, his, musical, conscience, to, dictate, his, editing, and, he, changed, or, removed, what, he, considered, musical, over, experimentation, or, poor, form, because, of, this, rimsky, korsakov, has, been, accused, of, pedantry, in, correcting, among, other, things, matters, of, harmony, rimsky, korsakov, may, have, foreseen, questions, over, his, efforts, when, he, wrote, if, mussorgsky, s, compositions, are, destined, to, live, unfaded, for, fifty, years, after, their, author, s, death, when, all, his, works, will, become, the, property, of, any, and, every, publisher, such, an, archeologically, accurate, edition, will, always, be, possible, as, the, manuscripts, went, to, the, public, library, on, leaving, me, for, the, present, though, there, was, need, of, an, edition, for, performances, for, practical, artistic, purposes, for, making, his, colossal, talent, known, and, not, for, the, mere, studying, of, his, personality, and, artistic, sins, maes, stated, that, time, proved, rimsky, korsakov, correct, when, it, came, to, posterity, s, re, evaluation, of, mussorgsky, s, work, mussorgsky, s, musical, style, once, considered, unpolished, is, now, admired, for, its, originality, while, rimsky, korsakov, s, arrangement, of, night, on, bald, mountain, is, still, the, version, generally, performed, rimsky, korsakov, s, other, revisions, like, his, version, of, boris, godunov, have, been, replaced, by, mussorgsky, s, original, rimsky, korsakov, may, have, saved, the, most, personal, side, of, his, creativity, for, his, approach, to, russian, folklore, folklorism, as, practiced, by, balakirev, and, the, other, members, of, the, five, had, been, based, largely, on, the, protyazhnaya, dance, song, protyazhnaya, literally, meant, drawn, out, song, or, melismatically, elaborated, lyric, song, the, characteristics, of, this, song, exhibit, extreme, rhythmic, flexibility, an, asymmetrical, phrase, structure, and, tonal, ambiguity, after, composing, may, night, rimsky, korsakov, was, increasingly, drawn, to, calendar, songs, which, were, written, for, specific, ritual, occasions, the, ties, to, folk, culture, was, what, interested, him, most, in, folk, music, even, in, his, days, with, the, five, these, songs, formed, a, part, of, rural, customs, echoed, old, slavic, paganism, and, the, pantheistic, world, of, folk, rites, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, that, his, interest, in, these, songs, was, heightened, by, his, study, of, them, while, compiling, his, folk, song, collections, he, wrote, that, he, was, captivated, by, the, poetic, side, of, the, cult, of, sun, worship, and, sought, its, survivals, and, echoes, in, both, the, tunes, and, the, words, of, the, songs, the, pictures, of, the, ancient, pagan, period, and, spirit, loomed, before, me, as, it, then, seemed, with, great, clarity, luring, me, on, with, the, charm, of, antiquity, these, occupations, subsequently, had, a, great, influence, in, the, direction, of, my, own, activity, as, a, composer, rimsky, korsakov, s, interest, in, pantheism, was, whetted, by, the, folkloristic, studies, of, alexander, afanasyev, that, author, s, standard, work, the, poetic, outlook, on, nature, by, the, slavs, became, rimsky, korsakov, s, pantheistic, bible, the, composer, first, applied, afanasyev, s, ideas, in, may, night, in, which, he, helped, fill, out, gogol, s, story, by, using, folk, dances, and, calendar, songs, he, went, further, down, this, path, in, the, snow, maiden, where, he, made, extensive, use, of, seasonal, calendar, songs, and, khorovodi, ceremonial, dances, in, the, folk, tradition, musicologists, and, slavicists, have, long, recognized, that, rimsky, korsakov, was, an, ecumenical, artist, whose, folklore, inspired, operas, take, up, such, issues, as, the, relationship, between, paganism, and, christianity, and, the, seventeenth, century, schism, in, the, orthodox, church, rimsky, korsakov, s, autobiography, and, his, books, on, harmony, and, orchestration, have, been, translated, into, english, and, published, two, books, he, started, in, 1892, but, left, unfinished, were, a, comprehensive, text, on, russian, music, and, a, manuscript, now, lost, on, an, unknown, subject, in, english, in, russian, category
