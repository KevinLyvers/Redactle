consolidation, of, power, by, the, increasingly, powerful, monarchs, the, increase, in, monarchical, power, and, its, conflicts, with, the, church, of, rome, were, only, exacerbated, by, the, rise, to, power, of, philip, iv, in, 1285, in, france, the, process, of, centralizing, royal, power, and, developing, a, genuine, national, state, began, with, the, capetian, kings, during, his, reign, philip, surrounded, himself, with, the, best, civil, lawyers, and, decidedly, expelled, the, clergy, from, all, participation, in, the, administration, of, the, law, with, the, clergy, beginning, to, be, taxed, in, france, and, england, to, finance, their, ongoing, wars, against, each, other, boniface, took, a, hard, stand, against, it, he, saw, the, taxation, as, an, assault, on, traditional, clerical, rights, and, ordered, the, bull, clericis, laicos, in, february, 1296, forbidding, lay, taxation, of, the, clergy, without, prior, papal, approval, in, the, bull, boniface, states, they, exact, and, demand, from, the, same, the, half, tithe, or, twentieth, or, any, other, portion, or, proportion, of, their, revenues, or, goods, and, in, many, ways, they, try, to, bring, them, into, slavery, and, subject, them, to, their, authority, and, also, whatsoever, emperors, kings, or, princes, dukes, earls, or, barons, presume, to, take, possession, of, things, anywhere, deposited, in, holy, buildings, should, incur, sentence, of, excommunication, it, was, during, the, issuing, of, clericis, laicos, that, hostilities, between, boniface, and, philip, began, at, war, with, both, his, english, and, his, flemish, vassals, philip, was, convinced, that, the, wealth, of, the, catholic, church, in, france, should, be, used, in, part, to, support, the, state, he, countered, the, papal, bull, by, decreeing, laws, prohibiting, the, export, of, gold, silver, precious, stones, horses, arms, or, food, from, france, to, the, papal, states, these, measures, had, the, effect, of, blocking, a, main, source, of, papal, revenue, philip, also, banished, from, france, the, papal, agents, who, were, raising, funds, for, a, new, crusade, in, the, middle, east, in, the, bull, ineffabilis, amor, of, september, 1296, boniface, pledged, approval, of, reasonable, taxation, for, genuine, emergencies, but, contested, philip, s, demands, asking, him, rhetorically, what, would, happen, to, you, god, forbid, if, you, gravely, offended, the, apostolic, see, and, caused, an, alliance, between, her, and, your, enemies, in, the, face, of, the, support, of, french, clergy, such, as, pierre, de, mornay, for, philip, s, general, position, and, the, need, for, french, revenue, to, combat, unrest, in, rome, from, the, colonna, family, boniface, retreated, still, further, in, february, 1297, the, bull, romana, mater, ecclesia, permitted, voluntary, clerical, donations, without, papal, approval, in, times, of, emergency, as, determined, by, the, king, on, 3, april, 1297, seven, french, archbishops, and, forty, bishops, provided, this, authorisation, agreed, to, concede, to, the, king, the, fifth, part, of, their, ecclesiastical, revenues, under, the, form, of, two, tithes, the, first, of, which, to, be, paid, by, pentecost, the, second, at, the, end, of, september, this, subsidy, could, be, collected, just, in, case, the, war, with, england, should, go, on, with, church, authority, and, not, by, means, of, the, secular, arm, by, july, 1297, boniface, yielded, completely, in, the, bull, etsi, de, statu, conceding, that, kings, could, raise, taxes, on, church, property, and, incomes, during, emergencies, without, prior, papal, approval, philip, rescinded, his, embargoes, and, even, accepted, boniface, s, nuncios, as, arbitrators, to, delay, and, conclude, his, war, with, the, english, with, the, 1303, treaty, of, paris, restoring, the, status, quo, but, obliging, edward, to, come, to, france, in, person, to, do, homage, for, the, return, of, aquitaine, boniface, proclaimed, 1300, a, jubilee, year, the, first, of, many, such, jubilees, to, take, place, in, rome, he, probably, wanted, to, gather, money, from, pilgrims, to, rome, as, a, substitute, for, the, missing, money, from, france, or, it, may, be, that, he, was, seeking, moral, and, political, support, against, the, hostile, behaviour, of, the, french, king, the, event, was, a, success, rome, had, never, received, such, crowds, before, it, is, said, that, on, one, particular, day, some, 30, 000, people, were, counted, giovanni, villani, estimated, that, some, 200, 000, pilgrims, came, to, rome, boniface, and, his, aides, managed, the, affair, well, food, was, plentiful, and, it, was, sold, at, moderate, prices, it, was, an, advantage, to, the, pope, that, the, great, sums, of, money, he, collected, could, be, used, according, to, boniface, s, own, judgment, after, king, edward, i, of, england, invaded, scotland, and, forced, the, abdication, of, the, scottish, king, john, balliol, the, deposed, king, was, released, into, the, custody, of, pope, boniface, on, condition, that, he, remain, at, a, papal, residence, the, hard, pressed, scottish, parliament, then, in, the, early, stages, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, first, scottish, war, of, independence, condemned, edward, i, s, invasion, and, occupation, of, scotland, and, appealed, to, the, pope, to, assert, a, feudal, overlordship, over, the, country, the, pope, assented, condemning, edward, s, invasions, and, occupation, of, scotland, in, the, papal, bull, scimus, fili, latin, for, we, know, my, son, of, 27, june, 1299, the, bull, ordered, edward, to, desist, from, his, attacks, and, start, negotiations, with, the, scots, however, edward, ignored, the, bull, in, 1301, a, letter, was, composed, in, which, the, english, rejected, its, authority, but, it, was, never, sent, the, feud, between, boniface, and, philip, iv, reached, its, peak, in, the, early, 14th, century, when, philip, began, to, launch, a, strong, anti, papal, campaign, against, boniface, a, quarrel, arose, between, philip, s, aides, and, a, papal, legate, bernard, saisset, the, legate, was, arrested, on, a, charge, of,

allies, in, 1301, in, the, bull, ausculta, fili, listen, son, december, 1301, boniface, viii, appealed, to, philip, iv, to, listen, modestly, to, the, vicar, of, christ, as, the, spiritual, monarch, over, all, earthly, kings, he, protested, against, the, trial, of, churchmen, before, philip, s, royal, courts, and, the, continued, use, of, church, funds, for, state, purposes, and, he, announced, that, he, would, summon, the, bishops, and, abbots, of, france, to, take, measures, for, the, preservation, of, the, liberties, of, the, church, when, the, bull, was, presented, to, philip, iv, robert, ii, count, of, artois, reportedly, snatched, it, from, the, hands, of, boniface, s, emissary, and, flung, it, into, the, fire, on, 10, february, 1302, the, bull, ausculta, fili, was,

issued, the, bull, unam, sanctam, one, holy, it, declared, that, both, spiritual, and, temporal, power, were, under, the, pope, s, jurisdiction, and, that, kings, were, subordinate, to, the, power, of, the, roman, pontiff, the, pope, also, appointed, cardinal, jean, le, moine, as, apostolic, legate, to, king, philip, to, attempt, to, find, some, resolution, of, the, impasse, that, had,

others, william, of, nogaret, who, had, conducted, the, negotiations, for, the, king, of, france, scorned, him, and, threatened, him, saying, that, he, would, take, him, bound, to, lyons, on, the, rhone, and, there, in, a, general, council, would, cause, him, to, be, deposed, and, condemned, no, man, dared, to, touch, nor, were, they, pleased, to, lay, hands, on, him, but, they, left, him,

and, st, peter, s, to, hold, a, council, but, the, grief, which, had, hardened, in, the, heart, of, pope, boniface, by, reason, of, the, injury, which, he, had, received, produced, in, him, once, he, had, come, to, rome, a, strange, malady, so, that, he, gnawed, at, himself, as, if, he, were, mad, and, in, this, state, he, passed, from, this, life, on, the, twelfth, day, of, october, in, the, year, of, christ, 1303, and, in, the, church, of, st, peter, near, the, entrance, of, the, doors, in, a, rich, chapel, which, was, built, in, his, lifetime, he, was, honorably, buried, he, died, of,
