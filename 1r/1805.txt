pierre, simon, marquis, de, laplace, l, p, l, s, french, 23, march, 1749, 5, march, 1827, was, a, french, scholar, whose, work, was, important, to, the, development, of, engineering, mathematics, statistics, physics, astronomy, and, philosophy, he, summarized, and, extended, the, work, of, his, predecessors, in, his, five, volume, m, canique, c, leste, celestial, mechanics, 1799, 1825, this, work, translated, the, geometric, study, of, classical, mechanics, to, one, based, on, calculus, opening, up, a, broader, range, of, problems, in, statistics, the, bayesian, interpretation, of, probability, was, developed, mainly, by, laplace, laplace, formulated, laplace, s, equation, and, pioneered, the, laplace, transform, which, appears, in, many, branches, of, mathematical, physics, a, field, that, he, took, a, leading, role, in, forming, the, laplacian, differential, operator, widely, used, in, mathematics, is, also, named, after, him, he, restated, and, developed, the, nebular, hypothesis, of, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, and, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, suggest, an, idea, similar, to, that, of, a, black, hole, with, stephen, hawking, stating, that, laplace, essentially, predicted, the, existence, of, black, holes, laplace, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, scientists, of, all, time, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, french, newton, or, newton, of, france, he, has, been, described, as, possessing, a, phenomenal, natural, mathematical, faculty, superior, to, that, of, almost, all, of, his, contemporaries, he, was, napoleon, s, examiner, when, napoleon, graduated, from, the, cole, militaire, in, paris, in, 1785, laplace, became, a, count, of, the, empire, in, 1806, and, was, named, a, marquis, in, 1817, after, the, bourbon, restoration, some, details, of, laplace, s, life, are, not, known, as, records, of, it, were, burned, in, 1925, with, the, family, ch, teau, in, saint, julien, de, mailloc, near, lisieux, the, home, of, his, great, great, grandson, the, comte, de, colbert, laplace, others, had, been, destroyed, earlier, when, his, house, at, arcueil, near, paris, was, looted, in, 1871, laplace, was, born, in, beaumont, en, auge, normandy, on, 23, march, 1749, a, village, four, miles, west, of, pont, l, v, que, according, to, w, w, rouse, ball, his, father, pierre, de, laplace, owned, and, farmed, the, small, estates, of, maarquis, his, great, uncle, maitre, oliver, de, laplace, had, held, the, title, of, chirurgien, royal, it, would, seem, that, from, a, pupil, he, became, an, usher, in, the, school, at, beaumont, but, having, procured, a, letter, of, introduction, to, d, alembert, he, went, to, paris, to, advance, his, fortune, however, karl, pearson, is, scathing, about, the, inaccuracies, in, rouse, ball, s, account, and, states, indeed, caen, was, probably, in, laplace, s, day, the, most, intellectually, active, of, all, the, towns, of, normandy, it, was, here, that, laplace, was, educated, and, was, provisionally, a, professor, it, was, here, he, wrote, his, first, paper, published, in, the, m, langes, of, the, royal, society, of, turin, tome, iv, 1766, 1769, at, least, two, years, before, he, went, at, 22, or, 23, to, paris, in, 1771, thus, before, he, was, 20, he, was, in, touch, with, lagrange, in, turin, he, did, not, go, to, paris, a, raw, self, taught, country, lad, with, only, a, peasant, background, in, 1765, at, the, age, of, sixteen, laplace, left, the, school, of, the, duke, of, orleans, in, beaumont, and, went, to, the, university, of, caen, where, he, appears, to, have, studied, for, five, years, and, was, a, member, of, the, sphinx, the, cole, militaire, of, beaumont, did, not, replace, the, old, school, until, 1776, his, parents, pierre, laplace, and, marie, anne, sochon, were, from, comfortable, families, the, laplace, family, was, involved, in, agriculture, until, at, least, 1750, but, pierre, laplace, senior, was, also, a, cider, merchant, and, syndic, of, the, town, of, beaumont, pierre, simon, laplace, attended, a, school, in, the, village, run, at, a, benedictine, priory, his, father, intending, that, he, be, ordained, in, the, roman, catholic, church, at, sixteen, to, further, his, father, s, intention, he, was, sent, to, the, university, of, caen, to, read, theology, at, the, university, he, was, mentored, by, two, enthusiastic, teachers, of, mathematics, christophe, gadbled, and, pierre, le, canu, who, awoke, his, zeal, for, the, subject, here, laplace, s, brilliance, as, a, mathematician, was, quickly, recognised, and, while, still, at, caen, he, wrote, a, memoir, sur, le, calcul, integral, aux, differences, infiniment, petites, et, aux, differences, finies, this, provided, the, first, correspondence, between, laplace, and, lagrange, lagrange, was, the, senior, by, thirteen, years, and, had, recently, founded, in, his, native, city, turin, a, journal, named, miscellanea, taurinensia, in, which, many, of, his, early, works, were, printed, and, it, was, in, the, fourth, volume, of, this, series, that, laplace, s, paper, appeared, about, this, time, recognising, that, he, had, no, vocation, for, the, priesthood, he, resolved, to, become, a, professional, mathematician, some, sources, state, that, he, then, broke, with, the, church, and, became, an, atheist, laplace, did, not, graduate, in, theology, but, left, for, paris, with, a, letter, of, introduction, from, le, canu, to, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, who, at, that, time, was, supreme, in, scientific, circles, according, to, his, great, great, grandson, d, alembert, received, him, rather, poorly, and, to, get, rid, of, him, gave, him, a, thick, mathematics, book, saying, to, come, back, when, he, had, read, it, when, laplace, came, back, a, few, days, later, d, alembert, was, even, less, friendly, and, did, not, hide, his, opinion, that, it, was, impossible, that, laplace, could, have, read, and, understood, the, book, but, upon, questioning, him, he, realised, that, it, was, true, and, from, that, time, he, took, laplace, under, his, care, another, account, is, that, laplace, solved, overnight, a, problem, that, d, alembert, set, him, for, submission, the, following, week, then, solved, a, harder, problem, the, following, night, d, alembert, was, impressed, and, recommended, him, for, a, teaching, place, in, the, cole, militaire, with, a, secure, income, and, undemanding, teaching, laplace, now, threw, himself, into, original, research, and, for, the, next, seventeen, years, 1771, 1787, he, produced, much, of, his, original, work, in, astronomy, from, 1780, to, 1784, laplace, and, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, collaborated, on, several, experimental, investigations, designing, their, own, equipment, for, the, task, in, 1783, they, published, their, joint, paper, memoir, on, heat, in, which, they, discussed, the, kinetic, theory, of, molecular, motion, in, their, experiments, they, measured, the, specific, heat, of, various, bodies, and, the, expansion, of, metals, with, increasing, temperature, they, also, measured, the, boiling, points, of, ethanol, and, ether, under, pressure, laplace, further, impressed, the, marquis, de, condorcet, and, already, by, 1771, laplace, felt, entitled, to, membership, in, the, french, academy, of, sciences, however, that, year, admission, went, to, alexandre, th, ophile, vandermonde, and, in, 1772, to, jacques, antoine, joseph, cousin, laplace, was, disgruntled, and, early, in, 1773, d, alembert, wrote, to, lagrange, in, berlin, to, ask, if, a, position, could, be, found, for, laplace, there, however, condorcet, became, permanent, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, in, february, and, laplace, was, elected, associate, member, on, 31, march, at, age, 24, in, 1773, laplace, read, his, paper, on, the, invariability, of, planetary, motion, in, front, of, the, academy, des, sciences, that, march, he, was, elected, to, the, academy, a, place, where, he, conducted, the, majority, of, his, science, on, 15, march, 1788, at, the, age, of, thirty, nine, laplace, married, marie, charlotte, de, courty, de, romanges, an, eighteen, year, old, girl, from, a, good, family, in, besan, on, the, wedding, was, celebrated, at, saint, sulpice, paris, the, couple, had, a, son, charles, mile, 1789, 1874, and, a, daughter, sophie, suzanne, 1792, 1813, laplace, s, early, published, work, in, 1771, started, with, differential, equations, and, finite, differences, but, he, was, already, starting, to, think, about, the, mathematical, and, philosophical, concepts, of, probability, and, statistics, however, before, his, election, to, the, acad, mie, in, 1773, he, had, already, drafted, two, papers, that, would, establish, his, reputation, the, first, m, moire, sur, la, probabilit, des, causes, par, les, v, nements, was, ultimately, published, in, 1774, while, the, second, paper, published, in, 1776, further, elaborated, his, statistical, thinking, and, also, began, his, systematic, work, on, celestial, mechanics, and, the, stability, of, the, solar, system, the, two, disciplines, would, always, be, interlinked, in, his, mind, laplace, took, probability, as, an, instrument, for, repairing, defects, in, knowledge, laplace, s, work, on, probability, and, statistics, is, discussed, below, with, his, mature, work, on, the, analytic, theory, of, probabilities, sir, isaac, newton, had, published, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, 1687, in, which, he, gave, a, derivation, of, kepler, s, laws, which, describe, the, motion, of, the, planets, from, his, laws, of, motion, and, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, however, though, newton, had, privately, developed, the, methods, of, calculus, all, his, published, work, used, cumbersome, geometric, reasoning, unsuitable, to, account, for, the, more, subtle, higher, order, effects, of, interactions, between, the, planets, newton, himself, had, doubted, the, possibility, of, a, mathematical, solution, to, the, whole, even, concluding, that, periodic, divine, intervention, was, necessary, to, guarantee, the, stability, of, the, solar, system, dispensing, with, the, hypothesis, of, divine, intervention, would, be, a, major, activity, of, laplace, s, scientific, life, it, is, now, generally, regarded, that, laplace, s, methods, on, their, own, though, vital, to, the, development, of, the, theory, are, not, sufficiently, precise, to, demonstrate, the, stability, of, the, solar, system, today, the, solar, system, is, understood, to, be, generally, chaotic, at, fine, scales, although, currently, fairly, stable, on, coarse, scale, 83, 93, one, particular, problem, from, observational, astronomy, was, the, apparent, instability, whereby, jupiter, s, orbit, appeared, to, be, shrinking, while, that, of, saturn, was, expanding, the, problem, had, been, tackled, by, leonhard, euler, in, 1748, and, joseph, louis, lagrange, in, 1763, but, without, success, in, 1776, laplace, published, a, memoir, in, which, he, first, explored, the, possible, influences, of, a, purported, luminiferous, ether, or, of, a, law, of, gravitation, that, did, not, act, instantaneously, he, ultimately, returned, to, an, intellectual, investment, in, newtonian, gravity, euler, and, lagrange, had, made, a, practical, approximation, by, ignoring, small, terms, in, the, equations, of, motion, laplace, noted, that, though, the, terms, themselves, were, small, when, integrated, over, time, they, could, become, important, laplace, carried, his, analysis, into, the, higher, order, terms, up, to, and, including, the, cubic, using, this, more, exact, analysis, laplace, concluded, that, any, two, planets, and, the, sun, must, be, in, mutual, equilibrium, and, thereby, launched, his, work, on, the, stability, of, the, solar, system, gerald, james, whitrow, described, the, achievement, as, the, most, important, advance, in, physical, astronomy, since, newton, laplace, had, a, wide, knowledge, of, all, sciences, and, dominated, all, discussions, in, the, acad, mie, laplace, seems, to, have, regarded, analysis, merely, as, a, means, of, attacking, physical, problems, though, the, ability, with, which, he, invented, the, necessary, analysis, is, almost, phenomenal, as, long, as, his, results, were, true, he, took, but, little, trouble, to, explain, the, steps, by, which, he, arrived, at, them, he, never, studied, elegance, or, symmetry, in, his, processes, and, it, was, sufficient, for, him, if, he, could, by, any, means, solve, the, particular, question, he, was, discussing, while, newton, explained, the, tides, by, describing, the, tide, generating, forces, and, bernoulli, gave, a, description, of, the, static, reaction, of, the, waters, on, earth, to, the, tidal, potential, the, dynamic, theory, of, tides, developed, by, laplace, in, 1775, describes, the, ocean, s, real, reaction, to, tidal, forces, laplace, s, theory, of, ocean, tides, took, into, account, friction, resonance, and, natural, periods, of, ocean, basins, it, predicted, the, large, amphidromic, systems, in, the, world, s, ocean, basins, and, explains, the, oceanic, tides, that, are, actually, observed, the, equilibrium, theory, based, on, the, gravitational, gradient, from, the, sun, and, moon, but, ignoring, the, earth, s, rotation, the, effects, of, continents, and, other, important, effects, could, not, explain, the, real, ocean, tides, since, measurements, have, confirmed, the, theory, many, things, have, possible, explanations, now, like, how, the, tides, interact, with, deep, sea, ridges, and, chains, of, seamounts, give, rise, to, deep, eddies, that, transport, nutrients, from, the, deep, to, the, surface, the, equilibrium, tide, theory, calculates, the, height, of, the, tide, wave, of, less, than, half, a, meter, while, the, dynamic, theory, explains, why, tides, are, up, to, 15, meters, satellite, observations, confirm, the, accuracy, of, the, dynamic, theory, and, the, tides, worldwide, are, now, measured, to, within, a, few, centimeters, measurements, from, the, champ, satellite, closely, match, the, models, based, on, the, topex, data, accurate, models, of, tides, worldwide, are, essential, for, research, since, the, variations, due, to, tides, must, be, removed, from, measurements, when, calculating, gravity, and, changes, in, sea, levels, in, 1776, laplace, formulated, a, single, set, of, linear, partial, differential, equations, for, tidal, flow, described, as, a, barotropic, two, dimensional, sheet, flow, coriolis, effects, are, introduced, as, well, as, lateral, forcing, by, gravity, laplace, obtained, these, equations, by, simplifying, the, fluid, dynamic, equations, but, they, can, also, be, derived, from, energy, integrals, via, lagrange, s, equation, for, a, fluid, sheet, of, average, thickness, d, the, vertical, tidal, elevation, as, well, as, the, horizontal, velocity, components, u, and, v, in, the, latitude, and, longitude, directions, respectively, satisfy, laplace, s, tidal, equations, where, is, the, angular, frequency, of, the, planet, s, rotation, g, is, the, planet, s, gravitational, acceleration, at, the, mean, ocean, surface, a, is, the, planetary, radius, and, u, is, the, external, gravitational, tidal, forcing, potential, william, thomson, lord, kelvin, rewrote, laplace, s, momentum, terms, using, the, curl, to, find, an, equation, for, vorticity, under, certain, conditions, this, can, be, further, rewritten, as, a, conservation, of, vorticity, during, the, years, 1784, 1787, he, published, some, papers, of, exceptional, power, prominent, among, these, is, one, read, in, 1783, reprinted, as, part, ii, of, th, orie, du, mouvement, et, de, la, figure, elliptique, des, plan, tes, in, 1784, and, in, the, third, volume, of, the, m, canique, c, leste, in, this, work, laplace, completely, determined, the, attraction, of, a, spheroid, on, a, particle, outside, it, this, is, memorable, for, the, introduction, into, analysis, of, spherical, harmonics, or, laplace, s, coefficients, and, also, for, the, development, of, the, use, of, what, we, would, now, call, the, gravitational, potential, in, celestial, mechanics, in, 1783, in, a, paper, sent, to, the, acad, mie, adrien, marie, legendre, had, introduced, what, are, now, known, as, associated, legendre, functions, if, two, points, in, a, plane, have, polar, coordinates, r, and, r, where, r, r, then, by, elementary, manipulation, the, reciprocal, of, the, distance, between, the, points, d, can, be, written, as, this, expression, can, be, expanded, in, powers, of, r, r, using, newton, s, generalised, binomial, theorem, to, give, the, sequence, of, functions, p, 0, k, cos, is, the, set, of, so, called, associated, legendre, functions, and, their, usefulness, arises, from, the, fact, that, every, function, of, the, points, on, a, circle, can, be, expanded, as, a, series, of, them, laplace, with, scant, regard, for, credit, to, legendre, made, the, non, trivial, extension, of, the, result, to, three, dimensions, to, yield, a, more, general, set, of, functions, the, spherical, harmonics, or, laplace, coefficients, the, latter, term, is, not, in, common, use, now, p, 340ff, this, paper, is, also, remarkable, for, the, development, of, the, idea, of, the, scalar, potential, the, gravitational, force, acting, on, a, body, is, in, modern, language, a, vector, having, magnitude, and, direction, a, potential, function, is, a, scalar, function, that, defines, how, the, vectors, will, behave, a, scalar, function, is, computationally, and, conceptually, easier, to, deal, with, than, a, vector, function, alexis, clairaut, had, first, suggested, the, idea, in, 1743, while, working, on, a, similar, problem, though, he, was, using, newtonian, type, geometric, reasoning, laplace, described, clairaut, s, work, as, being, in, the, class, of, the, most, beautiful, mathematical, productions, however, rouse, ball, alleges, that, the, idea, was, appropriated, from, joseph, louis, lagrange, who, had, used, it, in, his, memoirs, of, 1773, 1777, and, 1780, the, term, potential, itself, was, due, to, daniel, bernoulli, who, introduced, it, in, his, 1738, memoire, hydrodynamica, however, according, to, rouse, ball, the, term, potential, function, was, not, actually, used, to, refer, to, a, function, v, of, the, coordinates, of, space, in, laplace, s, sense, until, george, green, s, 1828, an, essay, on, the, application, of, mathematical, analysis, to, the, theories, of, electricity, and, magnetism, laplace, applied, the, language, of, calculus, to, the, potential, function, and, showed, that, it, always, satisfies, the, differential, equation, an, analogous, result, for, the, velocity, potential, of, a, fluid, had, been, obtained, some, years, previously, by, leonhard, euler, laplace, s, subsequent, work, on, gravitational, attraction, was, based, on, this, result, the, quantity, 2, v, has, been, termed, the, concentration, of, v, and, its, value, at, any, point, indicates, the, excess, of, the, value, of, v, there, over, its, mean, value, in, the, neighbourhood, of, the, point, laplace, s, equation, a, special, case, of, poisson, s, equation, appears, ubiquitously, in, mathematical, physics, the, concept, of, a, potential, occurs, in, fluid, dynamics, electromagnetism, and, other, areas, rouse, ball, speculated, that, it, might, be, seen, as, the, outward, sign, of, one, of, the, a, priori, forms, in, kant, s, theory, of, perception, the, spherical, harmonics, turn, out, to, be, critical, to, practical, solutions, of, laplace, s, equation, laplace, s, equation, in, spherical, coordinates, such, as, are, used, for, mapping, the, sky, can, be, simplified, using, the, method, of, separation, of, variables, into, a, radial, part, depending, solely, on, distance, from, the, centre, point, and, an, angular, or, spherical, part, the, solution, to, the, spherical, part, of, the, equation, can, be, expressed, as, a, series, of, laplace, s, spherical, harmonics, simplifying, practical, computation, laplace, presented, a, memoir, on, planetary, inequalities, in, three, sections, in, 1784, 1785, and, 1786, this, dealt, mainly, with, the, identification, and, explanation, of, the, perturbations, now, known, as, the, great, jupiter, saturn, inequality, laplace, solved, a, longstanding, problem, in, the, study, and, prediction, of, the, movements, of, these, planets, he, showed, by, general, considerations, first, that, the, mutual, action, of, two, planets, could, never, cause, large, changes, in, the, eccentricities, and, inclinations, of, their, orbits, but, then, even, more, importantly, that, peculiarities, arose, in, the, jupiter, saturn, system, because, of, the, near, approach, to, commensurability, of, the, mean, motions, of, jupiter, and, saturn, in, this, context, commensurability, means, that, the, ratio, of, the, two, planets, mean, motions, is, very, nearly, equal, to, a, ratio, between, a, pair, of, small, whole, numbers, two, periods, of, saturn, s, orbit, around, the, sun, almost, equal, five, of, jupiter, s, the, corresponding, difference, between, multiples, of, the, mean, motions, 2, n, j, 5, n, s, corresponds, to, a, period, of, nearly, 900, years, and, it, occurs, as, a, small, divisor, in, the, integration, of, a, very, small, perturbing, force, with, this, same, period, as, a, result, the, integrated, perturbations, with, this, period, are, disproportionately, large, about, 0, 8, degrees, of, arc, in, orbital, longitude, for, saturn, and, about, 0, 3, for, jupiter, further, developments, of, these, theorems, on, planetary, motion, were, given, in, his, two, memoirs, of, 1788, and, 1789, but, with, the, aid, of, laplace, s, discoveries, the, tables, of, the, motions, of, jupiter, and, saturn, could, at, last, be, made, much, more, accurate, it, was, on, the, basis, of, laplace, s, theory, that, delambre, computed, his, astronomical, tables, laplace, now, set, himself, the, task, to, write, a, work, which, should, offer, a, complete, solution, of, the, great, mechanical, problem, presented, by, the, solar, system, and, bring, theory, to, coincide, so, closely, with, observation, that, empirical, equations, should, no, longer, find, a, place, in, astronomical, tables, the, result, is, embodied, in, the, exposition, du, syst, me, du, monde, and, the, m, canique, c, leste, the, former, was, published, in, 1796, and, gives, a, general, explanation, of, the, phenomena, but, omits, all, details, it, contains, a, summary, of, the, history, of, astronomy, this, summary, procured, for, its, author, the, honour, of, admission, to, the, forty, of, the, french, academy, and, is, commonly, esteemed, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, french, literature, though, it, is, not, altogether, reliable, for, the, later, periods, of, which, it, treats, laplace, developed, the, nebular, hypothesis, of, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, first, suggested, by, emanuel, swedenborg, and, expanded, by, immanuel, kant, a, hypothesis, that, continues, to, dominate, accounts, of, the, origin, of, planetary, systems, according, to, laplace, s, description, of, the, hypothesis, the, solar, system, had, evolved, from, a, globular, mass, of, incandescent, gas, rotating, around, an, axis, through, its, centre, of, mass, as, it, cooled, this, mass, contracted, and, successive, rings, broke, off, from, its, outer, edge, these, rings, in, their, turn, cooled, and, finally, condensed, into, the, planets, while, the, sun, represented, the, central, core, which, was, still, left, on, this, view, laplace, predicted, that, the, more, distant, planets, would, be, older, than, those, nearer, the, sun, as, mentioned, the, idea, of, the, nebular, hypothesis, had, been, outlined, by, immanuel, kant, in, 1755, and, he, had, also, suggested, meteoric, aggregations, and, tidal, friction, as, causes, affecting, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, laplace, was, probably, aware, of, this, but, like, many, writers, of, his, time, he, generally, did, not, reference, the, work, of, others, laplace, s, analytical, discussion, of, the, solar, system, is, given, in, his, m, canique, c, leste, published, in, five, volumes, the, first, two, volumes, published, in, 1799, contain, methods, for, calculating, the, motions, of, the, planets, determining, their, figures, and, resolving, tidal, problems, the, third, and, fourth, volumes, published, in, 1802, and, 1805, contain, applications, of, these, methods, and, several, astronomical, tables, the, fifth, volume, published, in, 1825, is, mainly, historical, but, it, gives, as, appendices, the, results, of, laplace, s, latest, researches, laplace, s, own, investigations, embodied, in, it, are, so, numerous, and, valuable, that, it, is, regrettable, to, have, to, add, that, many, results, are, appropriated, from, other, writers, with, scanty, or, no, acknowledgement, and, the, conclusions, which, have, been, described, as, the, organised, result, of, a, century, of, patient, toil, are, frequently, mentioned, as, if, they, were, due, to, laplace, jean, baptiste, biot, who, assisted, laplace, in, revising, it, for, the, press, says, that, laplace, himself, was, frequently, unable, to, recover, the, details, in, the, chain, of, reasoning, and, if, satisfied, that, the, conclusions, were, correct, he, was, content, to, insert, the, constantly, recurring, formula, il, est, ais, voir, que, it, is, easy, to, see, that, the, m, canique, c, leste, is, not, only, the, translation, of, newton, s, principia, into, the, language, of, the, differential, calculus, but, it, completes, parts, of, which, newton, had, been, unable, to, fill, in, the, details, the, work, was, carried, forward, in, a, more, finely, tuned, form, in, f, lix, tisserand, s, trait, de, m, canique, c, leste, 1889, 1896, but, laplace, s, treatise, will, always, remain, a, standard, authority, in, the, years, 1784, 1787, laplace, produced, some, memoirs, of, exceptional, power, the, significant, among, these, was, one, issued, in, 1784, and, reprinted, in, the, third, volume, of, the, m, canique, c, leste, in, this, work, he, completely, determined, the, attraction, of, a, spheroid, on, a, particle, outside, it, this, is, known, for, the, introduction, into, analysis, of, the, potential, a, useful, mathematical, concept, of, broad, applicability, to, the, physical, sciences, laplace, was, a, supporter, of, the, corpuscle, theory, of, light, of, newton, in, the, fourth, edition, of, m, canique, c, leste, laplace, assumed, that, short, ranged, molecular, forces, were, responsible, for, refraction, of, the, corpuscles, of, light, laplace, and, tienne, louis, malus, also, showed, that, huygens, principle, of, double, refraction, could, be, recovered, from, the, principle, of, least, action, on, light, particles, however, in, 1815, augustin, jean, fresnel, presented, a, new, a, wave, theory, for, diffraction, to, a, commission, of, the, french, academy, with, the, help, of, fran, ois, arago, laplace, was, one, of, the, commission, members, and, they, ultimately, awarded, a, prize, to, fresnel, for, his, new, approach, i, 108, using, corpuscular, theory, laplace, also, came, close, to, propounding, the, concept, of, the, black, hole, he, suggested, that, gravity, could, influence, light, and, that, there, could, be, massive, stars, whose, gravity, is, so, great, that, not, even, light, could, escape, from, their, surface, see, escape, velocity, however, this, insight, was, so, far, ahead, of, its, time, that, it, played, no, role, in, the, history, of, scientific, development, in, 1806, laplace, bought, a, house, in, arcueil, then, a, village, and, not, yet, absorbed, into, the, paris, conurbation, the, chemist, claude, louis, berthollet, was, a, neighbour, their, gardens, were, not, separated, and, the, pair, formed, the, nucleus, of, an, informal, scientific, circle, latterly, known, as, the, society, of, arcueil, because, of, their, closeness, to, napoleon, laplace, and, berthollet, effectively, controlled, advancement, in, the, scientific, establishment, and, admission, to, the, more, prestigious, offices, the, society, built, up, a, complex, pyramid, of, patronage, in, 1806, laplace, was, also, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1812, laplace, issued, his, th, orie, analytique, des, probabilit, s, in, which, he, laid, down, many, fundamental, results, in, statistics, the, first, half, of, this, treatise, was, concerned, with, probability, methods, and, problems, the, second, half, with, statistical, methods, and, applications, laplace, s, proofs, are, not, always, rigorous, according, to, the, standards, of, a, later, day, and, his, perspective, slides, back, and, forth, between, the, bayesian, and, non, bayesian, views, with, an, ease, that, makes, some, of, his, investigations, difficult, to, follow, but, his, conclusions, remain, basically, sound, even, in, those, few, situations, where, his, analysis, goes, astray, in, 1819, he, published, a, popular, account, of, his, work, on, probability, this, book, bears, the, same, relation, to, the, th, orie, des, probabilit, s, that, the, syst, me, du, monde, does, to, the, m, canique, c, leste, in, its, emphasis, on, the, analytical, importance, of, probabilistic, problems, especially, in, the, context, of, the, approximation, of, formula, functions, of, large, numbers, laplace, s, work, goes, beyond, the, contemporary, view, which, almost, exclusively, considered, aspects, of, practical, applicability, laplace, s, th, orie, analytique, remained, the, most, influential, book, of, mathematical, probability, theory, to, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, general, relevance, for, statistics, of, laplacian, error, theory, was, appreciated, only, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, however, it, influenced, the, further, development, of, a, largely, analytically, oriented, probability, theory, in, his, essai, philosophique, sur, les, probabilit, s, 1814, laplace, set, out, a, mathematical, system, of, inductive, reasoning, based, on, probability, which, we, would, today, recognise, as, bayesian, he, begins, the, text, with, a, series, of, principles, of, probability, the, first, seven, being, one, well, known, formula, arising, from, his, system, is, the, rule, of, succession, given, as, principle, seven, suppose, that, some, trial, has, only, two, possible, outcomes, labelled, success, and, failure, under, the, assumption, that, little, or, nothing, is, known, a, priori, about, the, relative, plausibilities, of, the, outcomes, laplace, derived, a, formula, for, the, probability, that, the, next, trial, will, be, a, success, where, s, is, the, number, of, previously, observed, successes, and, n, is, the, total, number, of, observed, trials, it, is, still, used, as, an, estimator, for, the, probability, of, an, event, if, we, know, the, event, space, but, have, only, a, small, number, of, samples, the, rule, of, succession, has, been, subject, to, much, criticism, partly, due, to, the, example, which, laplace, chose, to, illustrate, it, he, calculated, that, the, probability, that, the, sun, will, rise, tomorrow, given, that, it, has, never, failed, to, in, the, past, was, where, d, is, the, number, of, times, the, sun, has, risen, in, the, past, this, result, has, been, derided, as, absurd, and, some, authors, have, concluded, that, all, applications, of, the, rule, of, succession, are, absurd, by, extension, however, laplace, was, fully, aware, of, the, absurdity, of, the, result, immediately, following, the, example, he, wrote, but, this, number, is, far, greater, for, him, who, seeing, in, the, totality, of, phenomena, the, principle, regulating, the, days, and, seasons, realizes, that, nothing, at, the, present, moment, can, arrest, the, course, of, it, the, method, of, estimating, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, favourable, cases, to, the, whole, number, of, possible, cases, had, been, previously, indicated, by, laplace, in, a, paper, written, in, 1779, it, consists, of, treating, the, successive, values, of, any, function, as, the, coefficients, in, the, expansion, of, another, function, with, reference, to, a, different, variable, the, latter, is, therefore, called, the, probability, generating, function, of, the, former, laplace, then, shows, how, by, means, of, interpolation, these, coefficients, may, be, determined, from, the, generating, function, next, he, attacks, the, converse, problem, and, from, the, coefficients, he, finds, the, generating, function, this, is, effected, by, the, solution, of, a, finite, difference, equation, the, fourth, chapter, of, this, treatise, includes, an, exposition, of, the, method, of, least, squares, a, remarkable, testimony, to, laplace, s, command, over, the, processes, of, analysis, in, 1805, legendre, had, published, the, method, of, least, squares, making, no, attempt, to, tie, it, to, the, theory, of, probability, in, 1809, gauss, had, derived, the, normal, distribution, from, the, principle, that, the, arithmetic, mean, of, observations, gives, the, most, probable, value, for, the, quantity, measured, then, turning, this, argument, back, upon, itself, he, showed, that, if, the, errors, of, observation, are, normally, distributed, the, least, squares, estimates, give, the, most, probable, values, for, the, coefficients, in, regression, situations, these, two, works, seem, to, have, spurred, laplace, to, complete, work, toward, a, treatise, on, probability, he, had, contemplated, as, early, as, 1783, in, two, important, papers, in, 1810, and, 1811, laplace, first, developed, the, characteristic, function, as, a, tool, for, large, sample, theory, and, proved, the, first, general, central, limit, theorem, then, in, a, supplement, to, his, 1810, paper, written, after, he, had, seen, gauss, s, work, he, showed, that, the, central, limit, theorem, provided, a, bayesian, justification, for, least, squares, if, one, were, combining, observations, each, one, of, which, was, itself, the, mean, of, a, large, number, of, independent, observations, then, the, least, squares, estimates, would, not, only, maximise, the, likelihood, function, considered, as, a, posterior, distribution, but, also, minimise, the, expected, posterior, error, all, this, without, any, assumption, as, to, the, error, distribution, or, a, circular, appeal, to, the, principle, of, the, arithmetic, mean, in, 1811, laplace, took, a, different, non, bayesian, tack, considering, a, linear, regression, problem, he, restricted, his, attention, to, linear, unbiased, estimators, of, the, linear, coefficients, after, showing, that, members, of, this, class, were, approximately, normally, distributed, if, the, number, of, observations, was, large, he, argued, that, least, squares, provided, the, best, linear, estimators, here, it, is, best, in, the, sense, that, it, minimised, the, asymptotic, variance, and, thus, both, minimised, the, expected, absolute, value, of, the, error, and, maximised, the, probability, that, the, estimate, would, lie, in, any, symmetric, interval, about, the, unknown, coefficient, no, matter, what, the, error, distribution, his, derivation, included, the, joint, limiting, distribution, of, the, least, squares, estimators, of, two, parameters, in, 1814, laplace, published, what, may, have, been, the, first, scientific, articulation, of, causal, determinism, we, may, regard, the, present, state, of, the, universe, as, the, effect, of, its, past, and, the, cause, of, its, future, an, intellect, which, at, a, certain, moment, would, know, all, forces, that, set, nature, in, motion, and, all, positions, of, all, items, of, which, nature, is, composed, if, this, intellect, were, also, vast, enough, to, submit, these, data, to, analysis, it, would, embrace, in, a, single, formula, the, movements, of, the, greatest, bodies, of, the, universe, and, those, of, the, tiniest, atom, for, such, an, intellect, nothing, would, be, uncertain, and, the, future, just, like, the, past, would, be, the, present, to, it, this, intellect, is, often, referred, to, as, laplace, s, demon, in, the, same, vein, as, maxwell, s, demon, and, sometimes, laplace, s, superman, after, hans, reichenbach, laplace, himself, did, not, use, the, word, demon, which, was, a, later, embellishment, as, translated, into, english, above, he, simply, referred, to, une, intelligence, rien, ne, serait, incertain, pour, elle, et, l, avenir, comme, le, pass, serait, pr, sent, ses, yeux, even, though, laplace, is, generally, credited, with, having, first, formulated, the, concept, of, causal, determinism, in, a, philosophical, context, the, idea, was, actually, widespread, at, the, time, and, can, be, found, as, early, as, 1756, in, maupertuis, sur, la, divination, as, well, jesuit, scientist, boscovich, first, proposed, a, version, of, scientific, determinism, very, similar, to, laplace, s, in, his, 1758, book, theoria, philosophiae, naturalis, as, early, as, 1744, euler, followed, by, lagrange, had, started, looking, for, solutions, of, differential, equations, in, the, form, the, laplace, transform, has, the, form, this, integral, operator, transforms, a, function, of, time, t, displaystyle, t, into, a, function, of, a, complex, variable, s, displaystyle, s, usually, interpreted, as, complex, frequency, among, the, other, discoveries, of, laplace, in, pure, and, applied, mathematics, are, laplace, built, upon, the, qualitative, work, of, thomas, young, to, develop, the, theory, of, capillary, action, and, the, young, laplace, equation, laplace, in, 1816, was, the, first, to, point, out, that, the, speed, of, sound, in, air, depends, on, the, heat, capacity, ratio, newton, s, original, theory, gave, too, low, a, value, because, it, does, not, take, account, of, the, adiabatic, compression, of, the, air, which, results, in, a, local, rise, in, temperature, and, pressure, laplace, s, investigations, in, practical, physics, were, confined, to, those, carried, on, by, him, jointly, with, lavoisier, in, the, years, 1782, to, 1784, on, the, specific, heat, of, various, bodies, in, his, early, years, laplace, was, careful, never, to, become, involved, in, politics, or, indeed, in, life, outside, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, he, prudently, withdrew, from, paris, during, the, most, violent, part, of, the, revolution, in, november, 1799, immediately, after, seizing, power, in, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, napoleon, appointed, laplace, to, the, post, of, minister, of, the, interior, the, appointment, however, lasted, only, six, weeks, after, which, lucien, bonaparte, napoleon, s, brother, was, given, the, post, evidently, once, napoleon, s, grip, on, power, was, secure, there, was, no, need, for, a, prestigious, but, inexperienced, scientist, in, the, government, napoleon, later, in, his, m, moires, de, sainte, h, l, ne, wrote, of, laplace, s, dismissal, as, follows, geometrician, of, the, first, rank, laplace, was, not, long, in, showing, himself, a, worse, than, average, administrator, from, his, first, actions, in, office, we, recognized, our, mistake, laplace, did, not, consider, any, question, from, the, right, angle, he, sought, subtleties, everywhere, conceived, only, problems, and, finally, carried, the, spirit, of, infinitesimals, into, the, administration, grattan, guinness, however, describes, these, remarks, as, tendentious, since, there, seems, to, be, no, doubt, that, laplace, was, only, appointed, as, a, short, term, figurehead, a, place, holder, while, napoleon, consolidated, power, although, laplace, was, removed, from, office, it, was, desirable, to, retain, his, allegiance, he, was, accordingly, raised, to, the, senate, and, to, the, third, volume, of, the, m, canique, c, leste, he, prefixed, a, note, that, of, all, the, truths, therein, contained, the, most, precious, to, the, author, was, the, declaration, he, thus, made, of, his, devotion, towards, the, peacemaker, of, europe, in, copies, sold, after, the, bourbon, restoration, this, was, struck, out, pearson, points, out, that, the, censor, would, not, have, allowed, it, anyway, in, 1814, it, was, evident, that, the, empire, was, falling, laplace, hastened, to, tender, his, services, to, the, bourbons, and, in, 1817, during, the, restoration, he, was, rewarded, with, the, title, of, marquis, according, to, rouse, ball, the, contempt, that, his, more, honest, colleagues, felt, for, his, conduct, in, the, matter, may, be, read, in, the, pages, of, paul, louis, courier, his, knowledge, was, useful, on, the, numerous, scientific, commissions, on, which, he, served, and, says, rouse, ball, probably, accounts, for, the, manner, in, which, his, political, insincerity, was, overlooked, roger, hahn, in, his, 2005, biography, disputes, this, portrayal, of, laplace, as, an, opportunist, and, turncoat, pointing, out, that, like, many, in, france, he, had, followed, the, debacle, of, napoleon, s, russian, campaign, with, serious, misgivings, the, laplaces, whose, only, daughter, sophie, had, died, in, childbirth, in, september, 1813, were, in, fear, for, the, safety, of, their, son, mile, who, was, on, the, eastern, front, with, the, emperor, napoleon, had, originally, come, to, power, promising, stability, but, it, was, clear, that, he, had, overextended, himself, putting, the, nation, at, peril, it, was, at, this, point, that, laplace, s, loyalty, began, to, weaken, although, he, still, had, easy, access, to, napoleon, his, personal, relations, with, the, emperor, cooled, considerably, as, a, grieving, father, he, was, particularly, cut, to, the, quick, by, napoleon, s, insensitivity, in, an, exchange, related, by, jean, antoine, chaptal, on, his, return, from, the, rout, in, leipzig, he, accosted, mr, laplace, oh, i, see, that, you, have, grown, thin, sire, i, have, lost, my, daughter, oh, that, s, not, a, reason, for, losing, weight, you, are, a, mathematician, put, this, event, in, an, equation, and, you, will, find, that, it, adds, up, to, zero, in, the, second, edition, 1814, of, the, essai, philosophique, laplace, added, some, revealing, comments, on, politics, and, governance, since, it, is, he, says, the, practice, of, the, eternal, principles, of, reason, justice, and, humanity, that, produce, and, preserve, societies, there, is, a, great, advantage, to, adhere, to, these, principles, and, a, great, inadvisability, to, deviate, from, them, noting, the, depths, of, misery, into, which, peoples, have, been, cast, when, ambitious, leaders, disregard, these, principles, laplace, makes, a, veiled, criticism, of, napoleon, s, conduct, every, time, a, great, power, intoxicated, by, the, love, of, conquest, aspires, to, universal, domination, the, sense, of, liberty, among, the, unjustly, threatened, nations, breeds, a, coalition, to, which, it, always, succumbs, laplace, argues, that, in, the, midst, of, the, multiple, causes, that, direct, and, restrain, various, states, natural, limits, operate, within, which, it, is, important, for, the, stability, as, well, as, the, prosperity, of, empires, to, remain, states, that, transgress, these, limits, cannot, avoid, being, reverted, to, them, just, as, is, the, case, when, the, waters, of, the, seas, whose, floor, has, been, lifted, by, violent, tempests, sink, back, to, their, level, by, the, action, of, gravity, about, the, political, upheavals, he, had, witnessed, laplace, formulated, a, set, of, principles, derived, from, physics, to, favour, evolutionary, over, revolutionary, change, let, us, apply, to, the, political, and, moral, sciences, the, method, founded, upon, observation, and, calculation, which, has, served, us, so, well, in, the, natural, sciences, let, us, not, offer, fruitless, and, often, injurious, resistance, to, the, inevitable, benefits, derived, from, the, progress, of, enlightenment, but, let, us, change, our, institutions, and, the, usages, that, we, have, for, a, long, time, adopted, only, with, extreme, caution, we, know, from, past, experience, the, drawbacks, they, can, cause, but, we, are, unaware, of, the, extent, of, ills, that, change, may, produce, in, the, face, of, this, ignorance, the, theory, of, probability, instructs, us, to, avoid, all, change, especially, to, avoid, sudden, changes, which, in, the, moral, as, well, as, the, physical, world, never, occur, without, a, considerable, loss, of, vital, force, in, these, lines, laplace, expressed, the, views, he, had, arrived, at, after, experiencing, the, revolution, and, the, empire, he, believed, that, the, stability, of, nature, as, revealed, through, scientific, findings, provided, the, model, that, best, helped, to, preserve, the, human, species, such, views, hahn, comments, were, also, of, a, piece, with, his, steadfast, character, in, the, essai, philosophique, laplace, also, illustrates, the, potential, of, probabilities, in, political, studies, by, applying, the, law, of, large, numbers, to, justify, the, candidates, integer, valued, ranks, used, in, the, borda, method, of, voting, with, which, the, new, members, of, the, academy, of, sciences, were, elected, laplace, s, verbal, argument, is, so, rigorous, that, it, can, easily, be, converted, into, a, formal, proof, laplace, died, in, paris, on, 5, march, 1827, which, was, the, same, day, alessandro, volta, died, his, brain, was, removed, by, his, physician, fran, ois, magendie, and, kept, for, many, years, eventually, being, displayed, in, a, roving, anatomical, museum, in, britain, it, was, reportedly, smaller, than, the, average, brain, laplace, was, buried, at, p, re, lachaise, in, paris, but, in, 1888, his, remains, were, moved, to, saint, julien, de, mailloc, in, the, canton, of, orbec, and, reinterred, on, the, family, estate, the, tomb, is, situated, on, a, hill, overlooking, the, village, of, st, julien, de, mailloc, normandy, france, a, frequently, cited, but, potentially, apocryphal, interaction, between, laplace, and, napoleon, purportedly, concerns, the, existence, of, god, although, the, conversation, in, question, did, occur, the, exact, words, laplace, used, and, his, intended, meaning, are, not, known, a, typical, version, is, provided, by, rouse, ball, laplace, went, in, state, to, napoleon, to, present, a, copy, of, his, work, and, the, following, account, of, the, interview, is, well, authenticated, and, so, characteristic, of, all, the, parties, concerned, that, i, quote, it, in, full, someone, had, told, napoleon, that, the, book, contained, no, mention, of, the, name, of, god, napoleon, who, was, fond, of, putting, embarrassing, questions, received, it, with, the, remark, m, laplace, they, tell, me, you, have, written, this, large, book, on, the, system, of, the, universe, and, have, never, even, mentioned, its, creator, laplace, who, though, the, most, supple, of, politicians, was, as, stiff, as, a, martyr, on, every, point, of, his, philosophy, drew, himself, up, and, answered, bluntly, je, n, avais, pas, besoin, de, cette, hypoth, se, l, i, had, no, need, of, that, hypothesis, napoleon, greatly, amused, told, this, reply, to, lagrange, who, exclaimed, ah, c, est, une, belle, hypoth, se, a, explique, beaucoup, de, choses, ah, it, is, a, fine, hypothesis, it, explains, many, things, an, earlier, report, although, without, the, mention, of, laplace, s, name, is, found, in, antommarchi, s, the, last, moments, of, napoleon, 1825, je, m, entretenais, avec, l, je, le, f, licitais, d, un, ouvrage, qu, il, venait, de, publier, et, lui, demandais, comment, le, nom, de, dieu, qui, se, reproduisait, sans, cesse, sous, la, plume, de, lagrange, ne, s, tait, pas, pr, sent, une, seule, fois, sous, la, sienne, c, est, me, r, pondit, il, que, je, n, ai, pas, eu, besoin, de, cette, hypoth, se, while, speaking, with, l, i, congratulated, him, on, a, work, which, he, had, just, published, and, asked, him, how, the, name, of, god, which, appeared, endlessly, in, the, works, of, lagrange, didn, t, occur, even, once, in, his, he, replied, that, he, had, no, need, of, that, hypothesis, in, 1884, however, the, astronomer, herv, faye, affirmed, that, this, account, of, laplace, s, exchange, with, napoleon, presented, a, strangely, transformed, trangement, transform, e, or, garbled, version, of, what, had, actually, happened, it, was, not, god, that, laplace, had, treated, as, a, hypothesis, but, merely, his, intervention, at, a, determinate, point, in, fact, laplace, never, said, that, here, i, believe, is, what, truly, happened, newton, believing, that, the, secular, perturbations, which, he, had, sketched, out, in, his, theory, would, in, the, long, run, end, up, destroying, the, solar, system, says, somewhere, that, god, was, obliged, to, intervene, from, time, to, time, to, remedy, the, evil, and, somehow, keep, the, system, working, properly, this, however, was, a, pure, supposition, suggested, to, newton, by, an, incomplete, view, of, the, conditions, of, the, stability, of, our, little, world, science, was, not, yet, advanced, enough, at, that, time, to, bring, these, conditions, into, full, view, but, laplace, who, had, discovered, them, by, a, deep, analysis, would, have, replied, to, the, first, consul, that, newton, had, wrongly, invoked, the, intervention, of, god, to, adjust, from, time, to, time, the, machine, of, the, world, la, machine, du, monde, and, that, he, laplace, had, no, need, of, such, an, assumption, it, was, not, god, therefore, that, laplace, treated, as, a, hypothesis, but, his, intervention, in, a, certain, place, laplace, s, younger, colleague, the, astronomer, fran, ois, arago, who, gave, his, eulogy, before, the, french, academy, in, 1827, told, faye, of, an, attempt, by, laplace, to, keep, the, garbled, version, of, his, interaction, with, napoleon, out, of, circulation, faye, writes, i, have, it, on, the, authority, of, m, arago, that, laplace, warned, shortly, before, his, death, that, that, anecdote, was, about, to, be, published, in, a, biographical, collection, had, requested, him, to, demand, its, deletion, by, the, publisher, it, was, necessary, to, either, explain, or, delete, it, and, the, second, way, was, the, easiest, but, unfortunately, it, was, neither, deleted, nor, explained, the, swiss, american, historian, of, mathematics, florian, cajori, appears, to, have, been, unaware, of, faye, s, research, but, in, 1893, he, came, to, a, similar, conclusion, stephen, hawking, said, in, 1999, i, don, t, think, that, laplace, was, claiming, that, god, does, not, exist, it, s, just, that, he, doesn, t, intervene, to, break, the, laws, of, science, the, only, eyewitness, account, of, laplace, s, interaction, with, napoleon, is, from, the, entry, for, 8, august, 1802, in, the, diary, of, the, british, astronomer, sir, william, herschel, the, first, consul, then, asked, a, few, questions, relating, to, astronomy, and, the, construction, of, the, heavens, to, which, i, made, such, answers, as, seemed, to, give, him, great, satisfaction, he, also, addressed, himself, to, mr, laplace, on, the, same, subject, and, held, a, considerable, argument, with, him, in, which, he, differed, from, that, eminent, mathematician, the, difference, was, occasioned, by, an, exclamation, of, the, first, consul, who, asked, in, a, tone, of, exclamation, or, admiration, when, we, were, speaking, of, the, extent, of, the, sidereal, heavens, and, who, is, the, author, of, all, this, mons, de, la, place, wished, to, shew, that, a, chain, of, natural, causes, would, account, for, the, construction, and, preservation, of, the, wonderful, system, this, the, first, consul, rather, opposed, much, may, be, said, on, the, subject, by, joining, the, arguments, of, both, we, shall, be, led, to, nature, and, nature, s, god, since, this, makes, no, mention, of, laplace, s, saying, i, had, no, need, of, that, hypothesis, daniel, johnson, argues, that, laplace, never, used, the, words, attributed, to, him, arago, s, testimony, however, appears, to, imply, that, he, did, only, not, in, reference, to, the, existence, of, god, raised, a, catholic, laplace, appears, in, adult, life, to, have, inclined, to, deism, presumably, his, considered, position, since, it, is, the, only, one, found, in, his, writings, however, some, of, his, contemporaries, thought, he, was, an, atheist, while, a, number, of, recent, scholars, have, described, him, as, agnostic, faye, thought, that, laplace, did, not, profess, atheism, but, napoleon, on, saint, helena, told, general, gaspard, gourgaud, i, often, asked, laplace, what, he, thought, of, god, he, owned, that, he, was, an, atheist, roger, hahn, in, his, biography, of, laplace, mentions, a, dinner, party, at, which, the, geologist, jean, tienne, guettard, was, staggered, by, laplace, s, bold, denunciation, of, the, existence, of, god, it, appeared, to, guettard, that, laplace, s, atheism, was, supported, by, a, thoroughgoing, materialism, but, the, chemist, jean, baptiste, dumas, who, knew, laplace, well, in, the, 1820s, wrote, that, laplace, provided, materialists, with, their, specious, arguments, without, sharing, their, convictions, hahn, states, nowhere, in, his, writings, either, public, or, private, does, laplace, deny, god, s, existence, expressions, occur, in, his, private, letters, that, appear, inconsistent, with, atheism, on, 17, june, 1809, for, instance, he, wrote, to, his, son, je, prie, dieu, qu, il, veille, sur, tes, jours, aie, le, toujours, pr, sent, ta, pens, e, ainsi, que, ton, p, re, et, ta, m, re, ian, s, glass, quoting, herschel, s, account, of, the, celebrated, exchange, with, napoleon, writes, that, laplace, was, evidently, a, deist, like, herschel, in, exposition, du, syst, me, du, monde, laplace, quotes, newton, s, assertion, that, the, wondrous, disposition, of, the, sun, the, planets, and, the, comets, can, only, be, the, work, of, an, all, powerful, and, intelligent, being, this, says, laplace, is, a, thought, in, which, he, would, be, even, more, confirmed, if, he, had, known, what, we, have, shown, namely, that, the, conditions, of, the, arrangement, of, the, planets, and, their, satellites, are, precisely, those, which, ensure, its, stability, by, showing, that, the, remarkable, arrangement, of, the, planets, could, be, entirely, explained, by, the, laws, of, motion, laplace, had, eliminated, the, need, for, the, supreme, intelligence, to, intervene, as, newton, had, made, it, do, laplace, cites, with, approval, leibniz, s, criticism, of, newton, s, invocation, of, divine, intervention, to, restore, order, to, the, solar, system, this, is, to, have, very, narrow, ideas, about, the, wisdom, and, the, power, of, god, he, evidently, shared, leibniz, s, astonishment, at, newton, s, belief, that, god, has, made, his, machine, so, badly, that, unless, he, affects, it, by, some, extraordinary, means, the, watch, will, very, soon, cease, to, go, in, a, group, of, manuscripts, preserved, in, relative, secrecy, in, a, black, envelope, in, the, library, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, and, published, for, the, first, time, by, hahn, laplace, mounted, a, deist, critique, of, christianity, it, is, he, writes, the, first, and, most, infallible, of, principles, to, reject, miraculous, facts, as, untrue, as, for, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, it, offends, at, the, same, time, reason, experience, the, testimony, of, all, our, senses, the, eternal, laws, of, nature, and, the, sublime, ideas, that, we, ought, to, form, of, the, supreme, being, it, is, the, sheerest, absurdity, to, suppose, that, the, sovereign, lawgiver, of, the, universe, would, suspend, the, laws, that, he, has, established, and, which, he, seems, to, have, maintained, invariably, laplace, also, ridiculed, the, use, of, probability, in, theology, even, following, pascal, s, reasoning, presented, in, pascal, s, wager, it, is, not, worth, making, a, bet, for, the, hope, of, profit, equal, to, the, product, of, the, value, of, the, testimonies, infinitely, small, and, the, value, of, the, happiness, they, promise, which, is, significant, but, finite, must, necessarily, be, infinitely, small, in, old, age, laplace, remained, curious, about, the, question, of, god, and,

civilising, influence, maurice, thought, that, the, basis, of, laplace, s, beliefs, was, little, by, little, being, modified, but, that, he, held, fast, to, his, conviction, that, the, invariability, of, the, laws, of, nature, did, not, permit, of, supernatural, events, after, laplace, s, death, poisson, told, maurice, you, know, that, i, do, not, share, your, opinions, but, my, conscience, forces, me, to, recount, something, that, will, surely, please, you, when, poisson, had, complimented, laplace, about, his, brilliant, discoveries, the, dying, man, had, fixed, him, with, a, pensive, look, and, replied, ah, we, chase, after, phantoms, these, were, his, last, words, interpreted, by, maurice, as, a, realisation, of, the, ultimate, vanity, of, earthly, pursuits, laplace, received,

credible, that, laplace, had, a, proper, catholic, end, and, he, remained, a, skeptic, to, the, very, end, of, his, life, laplace, in, his, last, years, has, been, described, as, an, agnostic, in, 1470, the, humanist, scholar, bartolomeo, platina, wrote, that, pope, callixtus, iii, had, asked, for, prayers, for, deliverance, from, the, turks, during, a, 1456, appearance, of, halley, s, comet, platina, s, account, does, not, accord, with, church, records, which, do, not, mention, the, comet, laplace, is, alleged, to, have, embellished, the, story, by, claiming, the, pope, had, excommunicated, halley, s, comet, what, laplace, actually, said, in, exposition, du, syst, me, du, monde, 1796, was, that, the, pope, had, ordered, the, comet, to, be, exorcised, conjur, it, was,
