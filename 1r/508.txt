lessons, with, leibowitz, it, was, here, that, he, also, discovered, the, music, of, webern, he, eventually, found, leibowitz, s, approach, too, doctrinaire, and, broke, angrily, with, him, in, 1946,

music, mostly, by, composers, whose, music, he, disliked, such, as, milhaud, and, tchaikovsky, but, it, gave, him, the, chance, to, work, with, professional, musicians, while, leaving, time, to, compose, during, the, day, his, involvement, with, the, company, also, broadened, his, horizons, in, 1947, they, toured, to, belgium, and, switzerland, absolutely, pays, de, cocagne, my, first,

laurence, olivier, and, between, 1950, and, 1957, there, were, three, tours, to, south, america, and, two, to, north, america, much, of, the, music, he, wrote, for, the, company, was, lost, after, the, occupation, by, students, of, the, th, tre, de, l, od, on, during, the, civil, unrest, in, may, 1968, the, period, between, 1947, and, 1950, was, one, of, intense, compositional, activity, for, boulez, new, works, included, the, first, two, piano, sonatas, and, initial, versions, of, two, cantatas, on, poems, by, ren, char, le, visage, nuptial, and, le, soleil, des, eaux, in, october, 1951, a, substantial, work, for, eighteen, solo, instruments, polyphonie, x, caused, a, scandal, at, its, premiere, at, the, donaueschingen, festival, some, audience, members, whistling, and, hissing, during, the, performance, around, this, time, boulez, met, two, composers, who, were, to, be, important, influences, john, cage, and, karlheinz, stockhausen, his, friendship, with, cage, began, in, 1949, when, cage, was, visiting, paris, cage, introduced, boulez, to, two, publishers, heugel, and, amphion, who, agreed, to, take, his, recent, pieces, boulez, helped, to, arrange, a, private, performance, of, cage, s, sonatas, and, interludes, for, prepared, piano, when, cage, returned, to, new, york, they, began, an, intense, six, year, correspondence, about, the, future, of, music, their, friendship, later, cooled, as, boulez, could, not, accept, cage, s, increasing, commitment, to, compositional, procedures, based, on, chance, he, later, broke, off, contact, with, him, in, 1952, stockhausen, arrived, in, paris, to, study, with, messiaen, although, boulez, knew, no, german, and, stockhausen, no, french, the, rapport, between, them, was, instant, a, friend, translated, we, gesticulated, wildly, we, talked, about, music, all, the, time, in, a, way, i, ve, never, talked, about, it, with, anyone, else, in, july, 1952, boulez, attended, the, international, summer, course, for, new, music, in, darmstadt, for, the, first, time, as, well, as, stockhausen, boulez, was, in, contact, there, with, other, composers, who, would, become, significant, figures, in, contemporary, music, including, luciano, berio, and, luigi, nono, boulez, quickly, became, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, post, war, modernist, movement, in, the, arts, as, the, music, critic, alex, ross, observed, at, all, times, he, seemed, absolutely, sure, of, what, he, was, doing, amid, the, confusion, of, postwar, life, with, so, many, truths, discredited, his, certitude, was, reassuring, in, 1954, with, the, financial, backing, of, barrault, and, renaud, boulez, started, a, series, of, concerts, at, the, petit, marigny, theatre, which, became, known, as, the, domaine, musical, the, concerts, focused, initially, on, three, areas, pre, war, classics, still, unfamiliar, in, paris, such, as, bart, k, and, webern, works, by, the, new, generation, stockhausen, nono, and, neglected, masters, from, the, past, machaut, gesualdo, although, the, last, category, fell, away, in, subsequent, seasons, in, part, because, of, the, difficulty, of, finding, musicians, with, experience, of, playing, early, music, boulez, proved, an, energetic, and, accomplished, administrator, and, the, concerts, were, an, immediate, success, they, attracted, musicians, painters, and, writers, as, well, as, fashionable, society, but, they, were, so, expensive, that, boulez, had, to, turn, to, wealthy, patrons, for, support, key, events, in, the, domaine, s, history, included, a, webern, festival, 1955, the, european, premiere, of, stravinsky, s, agon, 1957, and, first, performances, of, messiaen, s, oiseaux, exotiques, 1955, and, sept, ha, ka, 1963, boulez, remained, director, until, 1967, when, gilbert, amy, succeeded, him, on, 18, june, 1955, hans, rosbaud, conducted, the, first, performance, of, boulez, s, best, known, work, le, marteau, sans, ma, tre, at, the, iscm, festival, in, baden, baden, a, nine, movement, cycle, for, alto, voice, and, instrumental, ensemble, based, on, poems, by, ren, char, it, was, an, immediate, international, success, william, glock, wrote, even, at, a, first, hearing, though, difficult, to, take, in, it, was, so, utterly, new, in, sound, texture, and, feeling, that, it, seemed, to, possess, a, mythical, quality, like, that, of, schoenberg, s, pierrot, lunaire, when, boulez, conducted, the, work, in, los, angeles, in, early, 1957, stravinsky, attended, the, performance, he, later, described, the, piece, as, one, of, the, few, significant, works, of, the, post, war, period, of, exploration, boulez, dined, several, times, with, the, stravinskys, and, according, to, robert, craft, soon, captivated, the, older, composer, with, new, musical, ideas, and, an, extraordinary, intelligence, quickness, and, humour, relations, between, the, two, composers, soured, the, following, year, over, the, first, paris, performance, of, stravinsky, s, threni, for, the, domaine, musical, poorly, planned, by, boulez, and, nervously, conducted, by, stravinsky, the, performance, broke, down, more, than, once, in, january, 1958, the, improvisations, sur, mallarm, i, et, ii, were, premiered, forming, the, kernel, of, a, piece, which, grew, over, the, next, four, years, into, a, large, scale, five, movement, portrait, of, mallarm, pli, selon, pli, it, received, its, premiere, in, donaueschingen, in, october, 1962, around, this, time, boulez, s, relations, with, stockhausen, deteriorated, as, according, to, the, biographer, joan, peyser, he, saw, the, younger, man, supplanting, him, as, the, leader, of, the, avant, garde, in, 1959, boulez, left, paris, for, baden, baden, where, he, had, an, arrangement, with, the, southwest, german, radio, symphony, orchestra, to, work, as, composer, in, residence, and, to, conduct, some, smaller, concerts, he, also, had, access, to, an, electronic, studio, where, he, could, work, on, a, new, piece, po, sie, pour, pouvoir, he, moved, into, and, eventually, bought, a, large, hillside, villa, which, was, his, main, home, for, the, rest, of, his, life, during, this, period, he, turned, increasingly, to, conducting, his, first, engagement, as, an, orchestral, conductor, had, been, in, 1956, when, he, conducted, the, venezuela, symphony, orchestra, while, on, tour, with, barrault, his, breakthrough, came, in, 1959, when, he, replaced, the, ailing, hans, rosbaud, at, short, notice, in, demanding, programmes, of, twentieth, century, music, at, the, aix, en, provence, and, donaueschingen, festivals, this, led, to, debuts, with, the, amsterdam, concertgebouw, bavarian, radio, symphony, and, berlin, philharmonic, orchestras, in, 1963, boulez, conducted, his, first, opera, berg, s, wozzeck, at, the, op, ra, national, de, paris, directed, by, barrault, the, conditions, were, exceptional, with, thirty, orchestral, rehearsals, instead, of, the, usual, three, or, four, the, critical, response, was, favourable, and, after, the, first, performance, the, musicians, rose, to, applaud, him, he, conducted, wozzeck, again, in, april, 1966, at, the, oper, frankfurt, in, a, new, production, by, wieland, wagner, wieland, wagner, had, already, invited, boulez, to, conduct, wagner, s, parsifal, at, the, bayreuth, festival, later, in, the, season, and, boulez, returned, to, conduct, revivals, in, 1967, 1968, and, 1970, he, also, conducted, performances, of, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, with, the, bayreuth, company, at, the, osaka, festival, in, japan, in, 1967, but, the, lack, of, adequate, rehearsal, made, it, an, experience, he, later, said, he, would, rather, forget, his, conducting, of, the, new, production, by, v, clav, ka, l, k, of, debussy, s, pell, as, et, m, lisande, at, covent, garden, in, 1969, was, praised, for, its, combination, of, delicacy, and, sumptuousness, in, 1965, the, edinburgh, international, festival, staged, the, first, large, scale, retrospective, of, boulez, as, composer, and, conductor, in, 1966, he, proposed, a, reorganisation, of, french, musical, life, to, the, minister, of, culture, andr, malraux, but, malraux, instead, appointed, the, conservative, marcel, landowski, as, head, of, music, at, the, ministry, of, culture, boulez, expressed, his, fury, in, an, article, in, the, nouvel, observateur, announcing, that, he, was, going, on, strike, with, regard, to, any, aspect, of, official, music, in, france, in, march, 1965, boulez, had, made, his, orchestral, debut, in, the, united, states, with, the, cleveland, orchestra, in, february, 1969, he, became, its, principal, guest, conductor, and, on, the, death, of, george, szell, in, july, 1970, assumed, the, role, of, music, advisor, for, two, years, in, the, 1968, 69, season, he, also, made, guest, appearances, in, boston, chicago, and, los, angeles, apart, from, pli, selon, pli, boulez, s, only, substantial, new, work, to, emerge, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1960s, was, the, final, version, of, book, 2, of, his, structures, for, two, pianos, midway, through, the, decade, he, produced, several, new, works, including, clat, 1965, a, short, and, brilliant, piece, for, small, ensemble, which, by, 1970, had, grown, into, a, substantial, half, hour, work, clat, multiples, boulez, first, conducted, the, bbc, symphony, orchestra, in, february, 1964, at, worthing, accompanying, vladimir, ashkenazy, in, a, chopin, piano, concerto, boulez, recalled, it, was, terrible, i, felt, like, a, waiter, who, keeps, dropping, the, plates, his, appearances, with, the, orchestra, over, the, next, five, years, included, his, debuts, at, the, proms, and, at, carnegie, hall, 1965, and, tours, to, moscow, and, leningrad, berlin, and, prague, 1967, in, january, 1969, william, glock, controller, of, music, at, the, bbc, announced, his, appointment, as, chief, conductor, two, months, later, boulez, conducted, the, new, york, philharmonic, for, the, first, time, his, performances, so, impressed, both, orchestra, and, management, that, he, was, offered, the, chief, conductorship, in, succession, to, leonard, bernstein, glock, was, dismayed, and, tried, to, persuade, him, that, accepting, the, new, york, position, would, detract, both, from, his, work, in, london, and, his, ability, to, compose, but, boulez, could, not, resist, the, opportunity, as, glock, put, it, to, reform, the, music, making, of, both, these, world, cities, and, in, june, the, new, york, appointment, was, confirmed, his, tenure, in, new, york, lasted, between, 1971, and, 1977, and, was, not, an, unqualified, success, the, dependence, on, a, subscription, audience, limited, his, programming, he, introduced, more, key, works, from, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, and, with, earlier, repertoire, sought, out, less, well, known, pieces, in, his, first, season, he, conducted, liszt, s, the, legend, of, saint, elizabeth, and, via, crucis, performances, of, new, music, were, comparatively, rare, in, the, subscription, series, the, players, admired, his, musicianship, but, regarded, him, as, dry, and, unemotional, compared, to, bernstein, although, it, was, widely, accepted, that, he, improved, the, standard, of, playing, he, returned, on, only, three, occasions, to, the, orchestra, in, later, years, boulez, s, time, with, the, bbc, symphony, orchestra, was, happier, with, the, resources, of, the, bbc, behind, him, he, could, be, bolder, in, his, choice, of, repertoire, there, were, occasional, forays, into, the, classical, and, romantic, repertoire, particularly, at, the, proms, beethoven, s, missa, solemnis, in, 1972, the, brahms, german, requiem, in, 1973, but, for, the, most, part, he, worked, intensively, with, the, orchestra, on, the, music, of, the, twentieth, century, he, conducted, works, by, the, younger, generation, of, british, composers, such, as, harrison, birtwistle, and, peter, maxwell, davies, but, britten, and, tippett, were, absent, from, his, programmes, his, relations, with, the, musicians, were, generally, excellent, he, was, chief, conductor, between, 1971, and, 1975, continuing, as, chief, guest, conductor, until, 1977, thereafter, he, returned, to, the, orchestra, frequently, until, his, last, appearance, in, an, all, jan, ek, programme, at, a, 2008, prom, in, both, cities, boulez, sought, out, venues, where, new, music, could, be, presented, more, informally, in, new, york, he, began, a, series, of, rug, concerts, when, the, seats, in, avery, fisher, hall, were, taken, out, and, the, audience, sat, on, the, floor, and, a, contemporary, music, series, called, prospective, encounters, in, greenwich, village, in, london, he, gave, concerts, at, the, roundhouse, a, former, railway, turntable, shed, which, peter, brook, had, also, used, for, radical, theatre, productions, his, aim, was, to, create, a, feeling, that, we, are, all, audience, players, and, myself, taking, part, in, an, act, of, exploration, in, 1972, wolfgang, wagner, who, had, succeeded, his, brother, wieland, as, director, of, the, bayreuth, festival, invited, boulez, to, conduct, the, 1976, centenary, production, of, wagner, s, der, ring, des, nibelungen, the, director, was, patrice, ch, reau, highly, controversial, in, its, first, year, according, to, barry, millington, by, the, end, of, the, run, in, 1980, enthusiasm, for, the, production, vastly, outweighed, disapproval, it, was, televised, around, the, world, a, few, new, works, emerged, during, this, period, of, which, perhaps, the, most, important, is, rituel, in, memoriam, bruno, maderna, a, large, scale, orchestral, work, prompted, by, the, death, at, a, relatively, young, age, of, boulez, s, friend, and, fellow, composer, in, 1970, boulez, was, asked, by, president, pompidou, to, return, to, france, and, set, up, an, institute, specialising, in, musical, research, and, creation, at, the, arts, complex, now, known, as, the, centre, georges, pompidou, which, was, planned, for, the, beaubourg, district, of, paris, the, institut, de, recherche, et, coordination, acoustique, musique,

minute, work, for, soloists, ensemble, and, electronics, he, also, radically, reworked, earlier, pieces, including, notations, i, iv, a, transcription, and, expansion, for, large, orchestra, of, tiny,

included, a, multi, media, exhibition, at, the, mus, e, de, la, musique, in, paris, focusing, on, the, inspiration, he, had, drawn, from, literature, and, the, visual, arts, boulez, died, at, home,

next, day, at, the, saint, sulpice, in, paris, eulogists, included, barenboim, renzo, piano, and, laurent, bayle, then, president, of, the, philharmonie, de, paris, whose, large, concert, hall, had, been, inaugurated, the, previous, year, thanks, in, part, to, boulez, s, influence, boulez, s, earliest, surviving, compositions, date, from, his, school, days, in, 1942, 43, mostly, songs, on, texts, by, baudelaire, gautier, and, rilke, gerald, bennett, describes, the, pieces, as, modest, delicate, and, rather, anonymous, a, certain, number, of, standard, elements, of, french, salon, music, of, the, time, whole, tone, scales, pentatonic, scales, and, polytonality, as, a, student, at, the, conservatoire, boulez, composed, a, series, of, pieces, influenced, first, by, honegger, and, jolivet, prelude, toccata, and, scherzo, and, nocturne, for, solo, piano, 1944, 45, and, then, by, messiaen, trois, psalmodies, for, piano, 1945, and, a, quartet, for, four, ondes, martenot, 1945, 46, the, encounter, with, schoenberg, through, his, studies, with, leibowitz, was, the, catalyst, for, his, first, piece, of, serial, music, the, th, me, et, variations, for, piano, left, hand, 1945, peter, o, hagan, describes, it, as, his, boldest, and, most, ambitious, work, to, date, boulez, completed, douze, notations, in, december, 1945, it, is, in, these, twelve, aphoristic, pieces, for, piano, each, twelve, bars, long, that, bennett, first, detects, the, influence, of, webern, shortly, after, the, composition, of, the, piano, original, boulez, attempted, an, unperformed, and, unpublished, orchestration, of, eleven, of, the, pieces, over, a, decade, later, he, re, used, two, of, them, in, instrumental, interludes, in, his, improvisation, i, sur, mallarm, then, in, the, mid, 1970s, he, embarked, on, a, further, more, radical, transformation, of, the, notations, into, extended, works, for, very, large, orchestra, a, project, which, occupied, him, to, the, end, of, his, life, notations, was, only, the, most, extreme, example, of, boulez, s, tendency, to, revisit, earlier, works, as, long, as, my, ideas, have, not, exhausted, every, possibility, of, proliferation, they, stay, in, my, mind, robert, piencikowski, characterises, this, in, part, as, an, obsessional, concern, for, perfection, and, observes, that, with, some, pieces, one, could, speak, of, successive, distinct, versions, each, one, presenting, a, particular, state, of, the, musical, material, without, the, successor, invalidating, the, previous, one, or, vice, versa, although, he, notes, that, boulez, almost, invariably, vetoed, the, performance, of, previous, versions, the, sonatine, for, flute, and, piano, 1946, 1949, was, the, first, work, boulez, allowed, to, be, published, a, serial, work, of, great, energy, its, single, movement, form, was, influenced, by, schoenberg, s, chamber, symphony, no, 1, bennett, finds, in, the, piece, a, tone, new, to, boulez, s, writing, a, sharp, brittle, violence, juxtaposed, against, an, extreme, sensitivity, and, delicacy, in, the, piano, sonata, no, 1, 1946, 49, the, biographer, dominique, jameux, highlights, the, sheer, number, of, different, kinds, of, attack, in, its, two, short, movements, and, the, frequent, accelerations, of, tempo, in, the, second, movement, which, together, create, a, feeling, of, instrumental, delirium, there, followed, two, cantatas, based, on, the, poetry, of, ren, char, of, le, visage, nuptial, paul, griffiths, observes, that, char, s, five, poems, speak, in, hard, edged, surrealist, imagery, of, an, ecstatic, sexual, passion, which, boulez, reflected, in, music, on, the, borders, of, fevered, hysteria, in, its, original, version, 1946, 47, the, piece, was, scored, for, small, forces, soprano, contralto, two, ondes, martenot, piano, and, percussion, forty, years, later, boulez, arrived, at, the, definitive, version, for, soprano, mezzo, soprano, chorus, and, orchestra, 1985, 1989, le, soleil, des, eaux, 1948, originated, in, incidental, music, for, a, radio, drama, by, char, it, went, through, three, further, versions, before, reaching, its, final, form, in, 1965, as, a, piece, for, soprano, mixed, chorus, and, orchestra, the, first, movement, complainte, du, l, zard, amoureux, is, a, love, song, addressed, by, a, lizard, to, a, goldfinch, in, the, heat, of, a, summer, day, the, second, la, sorgue, is, a, violent, incantatory, protest, against, the, pollution, of, the, river, sorgue, the, second, piano, sonata, 1947, 48, is, a, half, hour, work, which, requires, formidable, technical, prowess, from, the, performer, its, four, movements, follow, the, standard, pattern, of, a, classical, sonata, but, in, each, of, them, boulez, subverts, the, traditional, model, for, griffiths, the, violent, character, of, much, of, the, music, is, not, just, superficial, it, is, expressive, of, a, need, to, obliterate, what, had, gone, before, boulez, played, the, work, for, aaron, copland, who, asked, but, must, we, start, a, revolution, all, over, again, yes, mercilessly, boulez, replied, that, revolution, entered, its, most, extreme, phase, in, 1950, 1952, when, boulez, developed, a, technique, in, which, not, only, pitch, but, other, musical, parameters, duration, dynamics, timbre, and, attack, were, organised, according, to, serial, principles, an, approach, known, as, total, serialism, or, punctualism, messiaen, had, already, made, an, experiment, in, this, direction, in, his, mode, de, valeurs, et, d, intensit, s, for, piano, 1949, boulez, s, first, sketches, towards, total, serialism, appeared, in, parts, of, livre, pour, quatuor, 1948, 49, revised, 2011, 12, a, collection, of, movements, for, string, quartet, from, which, the, players, may, choose, at, any, one, performance, foreshadowing, boulez, s, later, interest, in, variable, form, in, the, early, 1950s, boulez, began, to, apply, the, technique, rigorously, ordering, each, parameter, into, sets, of, twelve, and, prescribing, no, repetition, until, all, twelve, had, sounded, according, to, the, music, critic, alex, ross, the, resulting, surfeit, of, ever, changing, musical, data, has, the, effect, of, erasing, at, any, given, point, previous, impressions, the, listener, may, have, formed, the, present, moment, is, all, there, is, ross, observed, boulez, linked, this, development, to, a, desire, by, his, generation, to, create, a, tabula, rasa, after, the, war, his, works, in, this, idiom, are, polyphonie, x, 1950, 51, withdrawn, for, 18, instruments, the, two, musique, concr, te, tudes, 1951, 52, withdrawn, and, structures, book, i, for, two, pianos, 1951, 52, speaking, of, structures, book, i, in, 2011, boulez, described, it, as, a, piece, in, which, the, responsibility, of, the, composer, is, practically, absent, had, computers, existed, at, that, time, i, would, have, put, the, data, through, them, and, made, the, piece, that, way, but, i, did, it, by, hand, it, was, a, demonstration, through, the, absurd, asked, whether, it, should, still, be, listened, to, as, music, boulez, replied, i, am, not, terribly, eager, to, listen, to, it, but, for, me, it, was, an, experiment, that, was, absolutely, necessary, structures, book, i, was, a, turning, point, for, boulez, from, here, on, he, loosened, the, strictness, of, total, serialism, into, a, more, supple, gestural, music, i, am, trying, to, rid, myself, of, my, thumbprints, and, taboos, he, wrote, to, cage, the, most, significant, result, of, this, new, freedom, was, le, marteau, sans, ma, tre, 1953, 1955, described, by, griffiths, and, bill, hopkins, as, a, keystone, of, twentieth, century, music, three, short, poems, by, char, are, the, starting, point, for, three, interlocking, cycles, four, movements, are, vocal, settings, of, the, poems, one, is, set, twice, the, other, five, are, instrumental, commentaries, according, to, hopkins, and, griffiths, the, music, is, characterised, by, abrupt, tempo, transitions, passages, of, broadly, improvisatory, melodic, style, and, exotic, instrumental, colouring, the, piece, is, scored, for, contralto, soloist, with, alto, flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar, and, viola, boulez, said, that, the, choice, of, these, instruments, showed, the, influence, of, non, european, cultures, to, which, he, had, always, been, attracted, for, the, text, of, his, next, major, work, pli, selon, pli, 1957, 1989, boulez, turned, to, the, symbolist, poetry, of, st, phane, mallarm, attracted, by, its, extreme, density, and, radical, syntax, at, seventy, minutes, it, is, his, longest, composition, three, improvisations, on, individual, sonnets, are, framed, by, two, orchestral, movements, into, which, fragments, of, other, poems, are, embedded, boulez, s, word, setting, which, in, the, first, improvisation, is, straightforwardly, syllabic, becomes, ever, more, melismatic, to, the, point, where, the, words, cannot, be, distinguished, boulez, s, stated, aim, was, to, make, the, sonnets, become, the, music, at, a, deeper, structural, level, the, piece, is, scored, for, soprano, and, large, orchestra, often, deployed, in, chamber, groups, boulez, described, its, sound, world, rich, in, percussion, as, not, so, much, frozen, as, extraordinarily, vitrified, the, work, had, a, complex, genesis, reaching, its, definitive, form, in, 1989, from, the, 1950s, boulez, experimented, with, what, he, called, controlled, chance, in, his, article, sonate, que, me, veux, tu, he, wrote, of, the, investigation, of, a, relative, world, a, permanent, discovering, rather, like, the, state, of, permanent, revolution, peyser, observes, that, boulez, s, use, of, chance, is, different, from, john, cage, s, in, cage, s, music, the, performers, are, often, free, to, create, unforeseen, sounds, with, the, aim, of, removing, the, composer, s, intention, from, the, music, in, boulez, s, music, they, choose, between, possibilities, that, have, been, written, out, by, the, composer, when, applied, to, the, order, of, sections, this, is, sometimes, described, as, mobile, form, a, technique, devised, by, earle, brown, who, was, inspired, by, the, mobile, sculptures, of, alexander, calder, whom, boulez, met, when, he, was, visiting, new, york, in, 1952, boulez, employed, variants, of, the, technique, in, several, works, over, the, next, two, decades, in, the, third, piano, sonata, 1955, 1957, revised, 1963, the, pianist, chooses, different, routes, through, the, score, and, in, one, movement, trope, has, the, option, of, omitting, certain, passages, altogether, in, clat, 1965, the, conductor, triggers, the, order, in, which, each, player, joins, the, ensemble, in, domaines, 1961, 1968, it, is, the, soloist, who, dictates, the, order, in, which, the, sections, are, played, by, his, movement, around, the, stage, in, later, works, such, as, cummings, ist, der, dichter, 1970, revised, 1986, a, chamber, cantata, for, 16, solo, voices, and, small, orchestra, using, a, poem, by, e, e, cummings, the, conductor, chooses, the, order, of, certain, events, but, there, is, no, freedom, for, the, individual, player, in, its, original, version, pli, selon, pli, also, contained, elements, of, choice, for, the, instrumentalists, but, much, of, this, was, eliminated, in, later, revisions, by, contrast, figures, doubles, prismes, 1957, 1968, is, a, fixed, work, with, no, chance, element, piencikowski, describes, it, as, a, great, cycle, of, variations, whose, components, interpenetrate, each, other, instead, of, remaining, isolated, in, the, traditional, manner, it, is, notable, for, the, unusual, layout, of, the, orchestra, in, which, the, various, families, of, instruments, woodwind, brass, etc, are, scattered, across, the, stage, rather, than, being, grouped, together, jonathan, goldman, identifies, a, major, aesthetic, shift, in, boulez, s, work, from, the, mid, 1970s, onwards, characterised, variously, by, the, presence, of, thematic, writing, a, return, to, vertical, harmony, and, to, clarity, and, legibility, of, form, boulez, himself, said, the, envelope, is, simpler, the, contents, are, not, i, think, in, my, recent, work, it, is, true, that, the, first, approach, is, more, direct, and, the, gesture, is, more, obvious, let, s, say, for, goldman, rituel, in, memoriam, bruno, maderna, 1974, 75, marks, the, beginning, of, this, development, boulez, wrote, this, twenty, five, minute, work, as, an, epitaph, for, his, friend, and, colleague, the, italian, composer, and, conductor, who, died, in, 1973, aged, 53, the, piece, is, divided, into, fifteen, sections, the, orchestra, into, eight, groups, the, odd, numbered, sections, are, conducted, in, the, even, numbered, sections, the, conductor, merely, sets, each, group, in, motion, and, its, progress, is, regulated, by, a, percussionist, beating, time, in, his, dedication, boulez, described, the, work, as, a, ritual, of, disappearance, and, survival, griffiths, refers, to, the, work, s, awesome, grandeur, notations, i, iv, 1980, are, the, first, four, transformations, of, piano, miniatures, from, 1945, into, pieces, for, very, large, orchestra, in, his, review, of, the, new, york, premiere, andrew, porter, wrote, that, the, single, idea, of, each, original, piece, has, as, it, were, been, passed, through, a, many, faceted, bright, prism, and, broken, into, a, thousand, linked, lapped, sparkling, fragments, the, finale, a, terse, modern, rite, which, sets, the, pulses, racing, d, rive, 1, 1984, dedicated, to, william, glock, on, his, retirement, from, the, bath, festival, is, a, short, quintet, in, which, the, piano, takes, the, lead, the, material, is, derived, from, six, chords, and, according, to, ivan, hewett, the, piece, shuffles, and, decorates, these, chords, bursting, outwards, in, spirals, and, eddies, before, returning, to, its, starting, point, at, the, end, the, music, shivers, into, silence, boulez, compared, the, experience, of, listening, to, pre, recorded, electronic, music, in, the, concert, hall, to, a, crematorium, ceremony, his, real, interest, lay, in, the, instantaneous, transformation, of, instrumental, sounds, but, the, technology, was, not, available, until, the, founding, of, ircam, in, the, 1970s, before, then, he, had, produced, deux, etudes, 1951, for, magnetic, tape, for, pierre, schaeffer, s, groupe, recherche, de, la, radiodiffusion, fran, aise, as, well, as, a, large, scale, piece, for, live, orchestra, with, tape, po, sie, pour, pouvoir, 1958, he, was, dissatisfied, with, both, pieces, and, withdrew, them, the, first, piece, completed, at, ircam, was, r, pons, 1980, 1984, in, this, forty, minute, work, an, instrumental, group, is, placed, in, the, middle, of, the, hall, while, six, soloists, surround, the, audience, two, pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone, and, glockenspiel, xylophone, it, is, their, music, which, is, transformed, electronically, and, projected, through, the, space, peter, heyworth, described, the, moment, when, they, enter, some, ten, minutes, into, the, piece, it, is, as, though, a, great, window, were, thrown, open, through, which, a, new, sound, world, enters, and, with, it, a, new, world, of, the, imagination, even, more, impressive, is, the, fact, that, there, is, no, longer, a, schism, between, the, worlds, of, natural, and, electronic, sounds, but, rather, a, continuous, spectrum, dialogue, de, l, ombre, double, 1982, 1985, for, clarinet, and, electronics, grew, out, of, a, fragment, of, domaines, and, was, a, gift, for, luciano, berio, on, his, 60th, birthday, lasting, around, eighteen, minutes, it, is, a, dialogue, between, a, solo, clarinet, played, live, though, sometimes, reverberated, through, an, offstage, piano, and, its, double, in, passages, pre, recorded, by, the, same, musician, and, projected, around, the, hall, boulez, approved, transcriptions, of, the, piece, for, bassoon, in, 1995, and, for, recorder, in, 2011, in, the, early, 1970s, he, had, worked, on, an, extended, chamber, piece, called, explosante, fixe, for, eight, solo, instruments, electronically, transformed, by, a, machine, called, a, halophone, but, the, technology, was, primitive, and, he, eventually, withdrew, it, he, re, used, some, of, its, material, in, other, works, including, a, later, piece, with, the, same, name, this, definitive, version, was, composed, at, ircam, between, 1991, and, 1993, for, midi, flute, and, two, accompanying, flutes, with, ensemble, and, live, electronics, by, this, time, the, computer, could, follow, the, score, and, respond, to, triggers, from, the, players, according, to, griffiths, the, principal, flute, is, caught, as, if, in, a, hall, of, mirrors, its, line, imitated, in, what, the, other, flutes, play, and, then, in, the, contributions, of, the, larger, ensemble, hopkins, and, griffiths, describe, it, as, music, characteristically, caught, between, thrill, and, desperation, anth, mes, ii, for, violin, and, electronics, 1997, grew, out, of, a, piece, for, solo, violin, anth, mes, i, 1991, which, boulez, wrote, for, the, yehudi, menuhin, violin, competition, in, paris, and, which, in, turn, derived, from, material, in, the, original, explosante, fixe, the, virtuoso, writing, for, the, instrument, is, captured, by, the, electronic, system, transformed, in, real, time, and, propelled, around, the, space, to, create, what, jonathan, goldman, calls, a, hyper, violin, although, this, produces, effects, of, speed, and, complexity, which, no, violinist, could, achieve, boulez, restricts, the, palette, of, electronic, sounds, so, that, their, source, the, violin, is, always, recognisable, in, later, works, boulez, relinquished, electronics, although, griffiths, suggests, that, in, sur, incises, 1996, 1998, the, choice, of, like, but, distinct, instruments, spread, across, the, platform, enabled, boulez, to, create, effects, of, harmonic, timbral, and, spatial, echo, for, which, he, previously, used, electronic, means, the, piece, is, scored, for, three, pianos, three, harps, and, three, percussionists, including, steel, drums, and, grew, out, of, incises, 1993, 2001, a, short, piece, written, for, a, piano, competition, in, an, interview, in, 2013, he, described, it, as, his, most, important, work, because, it, is, the, freest, notation, vii, 1999, marked, hieratic, in, the, score, is, the, longest, of, the, orchestral, notations, according, to, griffiths, what, was, abrupt, in, 1945, is, now, languorous, what, was, crude, is, now, done, with, a, lifetime, s, experience, and, expertise, what, was, simple, is, fantastically, embellished, even, submerged, d, rive, 2, started, out, in, 1988, as, a, five, minute, piece, dedicated, to, elliott, carter, on, his, 80th, birthday, by, 2006, it, was, a, 45, minute, work, for, eleven, instruments, and, boulez, s, last, major, composition, according, to, claude, samuel, boulez, wanted, to, explore, rhythmic, shifts, tempo, changes, and, superimpositions, of, different, speeds, inspired, in, part, by, his, contact, with, the, music, of, gy, rgy, ligeti, boulez, described, it, as, a, sort, of, narrative, mosaic, boulez, s, unfinished, works, include, several, that, he, was, actively, progressing, and, others, which, he, put, to, one, side, despite, their, potential, for, further, development, in, the, latter, category, the, archives, contain, three, unpublished, movements, of, the, third, piano, sonata, and, further, sections, of, clat, multiples, which, if, performed, would, practically, double, its, length, regarding, works, boulez, was, known, to, be, working, on, in, his, later, years, the, premieres, of, two, more, orchestral, notations, v, and, vi, were, announced, by, the, chicago, symphony, orchestra, for, may, 2006, but, postponed, he, was, in, the, process, of, developing, anth, mes, 2, into, a, large, scale, work, for, violin, and, orchestra, for, anne, sophie, mutter, but, the, project, did, not, come, to, fruition, from, the, mid, 1960s, boulez, also, spoke, of, composing, an, opera, his, attempts, to, find, a, librettist, were, unsuccessful, both, times, the, writer, has, died, on, me, so, i, m, a, bit, superstitious, about, looking, for, a, third, candidate, from, the, late, 1960s, he, exchanged, ideas, with, the, radical, french, playwright, and, novelist, jean, genet, and, a, subject, treason, was, agreed, on, parts, of, a, draft, libretto, were, found, among, genet, s, papers, after, his, death, in, 1986, boulez, later, turned, to, the, german, playwright, heiner, m, ller, who, was, working, on, a, reduction, of, aeschylus, s, oresteia, when, he, died, in, 1995, again, without, leaving, anything, usable, in, the, 1980s, he, discussed, with, patrice, ch, reau, an, adaptation, of, genet, s, 1961, play, les, paravents, the, screens, which, was, planned, for, the, 1989, opening, of, the, op, ra, bastille, in, paris, but, this, too, came, to, nothing, in, a, 1996, interview, boulez, said, that, he, was, thinking, of, edward, bond, s, the, war, plays, or, lear, but, only, thinking, when, news, emerged, in, 2010, that, at, the, age, of, 85, he, was, working, on, an, opera, based, on, beckett, s, waiting, for, godot, few, believed, such, an, ambitious, undertaking, could, be, realised, so, late, in, the, day, boulez, was, one, of, the, leading, conductors, of, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, in, a, career, lasting, more, than, sixty, years, he, directed, most, of, the, world, s, major, orchestras, he, was, entirely, self, taught, although, he, said, that, he, learnt, a, great, deal, from, attending, d, sormi, re, s, and, hans, rosbaud, s, rehearsals, he, also, cited, george, szell, as, an, influential, mentor, boulez, gave, several, reasons, for, conducting, as, much, as, he, did, he, gave, his, first, concerts, for, the, domaine, musical, because, its, financial, resources, were, limited, i, told, myself, that, being, much, less, expensive, i, would, have, a, go, myself, he, also, said, that, the, best, possible, training, for, a, composer, was, to, have, to, play, or, conduct, his, own, works, and, to, face, their, difficulties, of, execution, yet, on, a, practical, level, he, sometimes, struggled, to, find, time, to, compose, given, his, conducting, commitments, the, writer, and, pianist, susan, bradshaw, thought, this, was, deliberate, and, related, to, a, sense, of, being, overshadowed, as, a, composer, by, stockhausen, who, from, the, late, 1950s, was, increasingly, prolific, the, french, litterateur, and, musicologist, pierre, souvchinsky, disagreed, boulez, became, a, conductor, because, he, had, a, great, gift, for, it, not, everyone, agreed, about, the, greatness, of, that, gift, according, to, writer, hans, keller, boulez, cannot, phrase, it, is, as, simple, as, that, the, reason, being, that, he, ignores, the, harmonic, implications, of, any, structure, he, is, dealing, with, to, the, extent, of, utterly, disregarding, harmonic, rhythm, and, hence, all, characteristic, rhythm, in, tonal, music, joan, peyser, considered, that, in, general, boulez, conducts, what, he, loves, magnificently, conducts, what, he, likes, very, well, and, with, rare, exceptions, gives, stiff, performances, of, the, classic, and, romantic, repertoire, the, conductor, otto, klemperer, described, him, as, without, doubt, the, only, man, of, his, generation, who, is, an, outstanding, conductor, and, musician, he, worked, with, many, leading, soloists, and, had, particularly, long, term, collaborations, with, daniel, barenboim, and, with, the, soprano, jessye, norman, according, to, peter, heyworth, boulez, produced, a, lean, athletic, sound, which, underpinned, by, his, rhythmic, exactitude, could, generate, an, electric, sense, of, excitement, the, ability, to, reveal, the, structure, of, a, score, and, to, clarify, dense, orchestral, textures, were, hallmarks, of, his, conducting, he, conducted, without, a, baton, and, as, heyworth, observed, there, is, no, trace, of, theatre, not, even, the, rather, theatrical, sort, of, economy, that, was, practised, by, richard, strauss, according, to, boulez, outward, excitement, uses, up, inner, excitement, boulez, s, ear, for, sound, was, legendary, there, are, countless, stories, of, him, detecting, for, example, faulty, intonation, from, the, third, oboe, in, a, complex, orchestral, texture, paul, griffiths, wrote, in, the, new, york, times, oliver, knussen, himself, a, well, known, composer, conductor, observed, that, his, rehearsals, are, models, of, clear, headedness, and, professional, courtesy, he, effortlessly, commands, respect, boulez, also, conducted, in, the, opera, house, his, chosen, repertoire, was, small, and, included, no, italian, opera, apart, from, wagner, he, conducted, only, twentieth, century, works, of, his, work, with, wieland, wagner, on, wozzeck, and, parsifal, boulez, said, i, would, willingly, have, hitched, if, not, my, entire, fate, then, at, least, a, part, of, it, to, someone, like, him, for, discussions, about, music, and, productions, were, thrilling, they, planned, other, productions, together, including, richard, strauss, s, salome, and, elektra, mussorgsky, s, boris, godunov, and, mozart, s, don, giovanni, however, by, the, time, rehearsals, for, their, bayreuth, parsifal, began, wieland, was, already, gravely, ill, and, he, died, in, october, 1966, when, the, frankfurt, wozzeck, was, revived, after, wieland, s, death, boulez, was, deeply, disillusioned, by, the, working, conditions, there, was, no, rehearsal, no, care, taken, over, anything, the, cynicism, of, the, way, an, opera, house, like, that, was, run, disgusted, me, it, still, disgusts, me, he, later, said, that, it, was, this, experience, which, prompted, his, notorious, remarks, in, an, interview, the, following, year, in, der, spiegel, in, which, he, claimed, that, no, opera, worth, mentioning, had, been, composed, since, 1935, that, a, beatles, record, is, certainly, cleverer, and, shorter, than, a, henze, opera, and, that, the, most, elegant, solution, to, opera, s, moribund, condition, would, be, to, blow, the, opera, houses, up, in, 1967, boulez, theatre, director, jean, vilar, and, choreographer, maurice, b, jart, were, asked, to, devise, a, scheme, for, the, reform, of, the, paris, op, ra, with, a, view, to, boulez, becoming, its, music, director, their, plan, was, derailed, by, the, political, fallout, from, the, 1968, student, protests, in, the, mid, 1980s, boulez, became, vice, president, of, the, planned, op, ra, bastille, in, paris, working, with, daniel, barenboim, who, was, to, be, its, music, director, in, 1988, pierre, berg, was, appointed, president, of, the, bastille, opera, he, dismissed, barenboim, and, boulez, withdrew, in, solidarity, boulez, conducted, only, specific, projects, in, productions, by, leading, stage, directors, when, he, could, be, satisfied, that, conditions, were, right, thanks, to, his, years, with, the, renaud, barrault, company, the, theatrical, dimension, was, as, important, to, him, as, the, musical, and, he, always, attended, staging, rehearsals, for, the, centenary, ring, in, bayreuth, boulez, originally, asked, ingmar, bergman, then, peter, brook, to, direct, both, of, whom, refused, peter, stein, initially, agreed, but, withdrew, in, 1974, patrice, ch, reau, who, was, primarily, a, theatre, director, accepted, and, went, on, to, create, one, of, the, defining, opera, productions, of, modern, times, according, to, allan, kozinn, the, production, helped, open, the, floodgates, of, directorial, reinterpretation, of, opera, sometimes, known, as, regietheater, ch, reau, treated, the, story, in, part, as, an, allegory, of, capitalism, drawing, on, ideas, that, george, bernard, shaw, explored, in, the, perfect, wagnerite, in, 1898, and, using, imagery, from, the, industrial, age, he, achieved, an, exceptional, degree, of, naturalism, in, the, singers, performances, boulez, s, conducting, was, no, less, controversial, emphasising, continuity, flexibility, and, transparency, over, mythic, grandeur, and, weight, in, its, first, year, the, production, met, with, hostility, from, the, largely, conservative, audience, and, around, thirty, orchestral, musicians, refused, to, work, with, boulez, in, subsequent, seasons, both, production, and, musical, realisation, grew, in, stature, over, the, following, four, years, and, after, the, final, performance, in, 1980, there, was, a, 90, minute, ovation, boulez, s, first, recordings, date, from, his, time, with, the, domaine, musical, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, and, were, made, for, the, french, vega, label, they, include, the, first, of, his, five, recordings, of, le, marteau, sans, ma, tre, with, contralto, marie, th, r, se, cahn, as, well, as, pieces, to, which, he, did, not, return, in, the, studio, such, as, stravinsky, s, renard, and,

a, wide, ranging, survey, of, the, music, of, schoenberg, with, the, bbc, symphony, orchestra, and, recorded, the, orchestral, works, of, ravel, with, the, new, york, philharmonic, and, the,

ensemble, intercontemporain, with, a, greater, emphasis, on, the, music, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, berio, ligeti, and, carter, as, well, as, a, survey, of, some, of, his, own, music, including, le, visage, nuptial, le, soleil, des, eaux, and, figures, doubles, prismes, in, 2015, erato, issued, pierre, boulez, the, complete, erato, recordings, on, 14, cds, from, 1991, onwards,

the, archives, of, radio, stations, and, orchestras, in, 2005, the, chicago, symphony, orchestra, released, a, 2, cd, set, of, broadcasts, by, boulez, focusing, on, works, which, he, had, not, recorded, commercially, including, jan, ek, s, glagolitic, mass, and, messiaen, s, l, ascension, according, to, jean, jacques, nattiez, boulez, was, one, of, two, twentieth, century, composers, who, wrote, most, prolifically, about, music, the, other, being, schoenberg, it, was, with, a, 1952, article, with, the, inflammatory, title, schoenberg, is, dead, published, in, the, british, journal, the, score, shortly, after, the, older, composer, s, death, that, boulez, first, attracted, international, attention, as, a, writer, this, highly, polemical, piece, in, which, he, attacked, schoenberg, for, his, conservatism, contrasting, it, with, webern, s, radicalism, caused, widespread, controversy, jonathan, goldman, points, out, that, over, the, decades, boulez, s, writings, addressed, very, different, readerships, in, the, 1950s, the, cultured, parisian, attendees, of, the, domaine, musical, in, the, 1960s, the, specialised, avant, garde, composers, and, performers, of, the, darmstadt, and, basel, courses, and, between, 1976, and, 1995, the, highly, literate, but, non, specialist, audience, of, the, lectures, he, gave, as, professor, of, the, coll, ge, de, france, much, of, boulez, s, writing, was, linked, to, specific, occasions, whether, a, first, performance, of, a, new, piece, notes, for, a, recording, or, a, eulogy, for, a, lost, colleague, generally, he, avoided, publishing, detailed, analyses, other, than, one, of, the, rite, of, spring, as, nattiez, points, out, as, a, writer, boulez, is, a, communicator, of, ideas, rather, than, of, technical, information, this, may, sometimes, prove, disappointing, to, composition, students, but, it, is, no, doubt, a, peculiarity, of, his, writing, that, explains, its, popularity, with, non, musicians, boulez, s, writings, have, appeared, in, english, as, stocktakings, from, an, apprenticeship, boulez, on, music, today, orientations, collected, writings, and, pierre, boulez, music, lessons, the, complete, coll, ge, de, france, lectures, throughout, his, career, he, also, expressed, himself, through, long, form, interviews, of, which, perhaps, the, most, substantial, are, those, with, antoine, gol, a, 1958, c, lestin, deli, ge, 1975, and, jean, vermeil, 1989, two, volumes, of, correspondence, have, been, published, with, the, composer, john, cage, from, the, period, 1949, 62, and, with, the, anthropologist, and, ethnomusicologist, andr, schaeffner, from, 1954, to, 1970, boulez, taught, at, the, darmstadt, summer, school, most, years, between, 1954, and, 1965, he, was, professor, of, composition, at, the, basel, music, academy, in, switzerland, 1960, 63, and, a, visiting, lecturer, at, harvard, university, in, 1963, he, also, taught, privately, in, the, early, part, of, his, career, students, included, the, composers, richard, rodney, bennett, jean, claude, loy, and, heinz, holliger, as, a, young, man, boulez, was, an, explosive, often, confrontational, figure, jean, louis, barrault, who, knew, him, in, his, twenties, caught, the, contradictions, in, his, personality, his, powerful, aggressiveness, was, a, sign, of, creative, passion, a, particular, blend, of, intransigence, and, humour, the, way, his, moods, of, affection, and, insolence, succeeded, one, another, all, these, had, drawn, us, near, to, him, messiaen, said, later, he, was, in, revolt, against, everything, at, one, point, boulez, turned, against, messiaen, describing, his, trois, petites, liturgies, de, la, pr, sence, divine, as, brothel, music, and, saying, that, the, turangal, la, symphonie, made, him, vomit, it, was, five, years, before, relations, were, restored, in, a, 2000, article, in, the, new, yorker, alex, ross, described, boulez, as, a, bully, boulez, did, not, disagree, certainly, i, was, a, bully, i, m, not, ashamed, of, it, at, all, the, hostility, of, the, establishment, to, what, you, were, able, to, do, in, the, forties, and, fifties, was, very, strong, sometimes, you, have, to, fight, against, your, society, one, of, the, most, notorious, instance, of, this, is, boulez, s, declaration, in, 1952, that, any, musician, who, has, not, experienced, i, do, not, say, understood, but, truly, experienced, the, necessity, of, dodecaphonic, music, is, useless, for, his, whole, work, is, irrelevant, to, the, needs, of, his, epoch, those, who, knew, boulez, well, often, referred, to, his, loyalty, both, to, individuals, and, to, organisations, when, his, mentor, the, conductor, roger, d, sormi, re, was, paralysed, by, a, stroke, in, 1952, boulez, sent, scripts, to, french, radio, in, d, sormi, re, s, name, so, that, the, older, man, could, collect, the, fee, the, writer, jean, vermeil, who, observed, boulez, in, the, 1990s, in, the, company, of, jean, batigne, founder, of, the, percussions, de, strasbourg, discovered, a, boulez, asking, about, the, health, of, a, musician, in, the, strasbourg, orchestra, about, another, player, s, children, a, boulez, who, knew, everyone, by, name, and, who, reacted, to, each, person, s, news, with, sadness, or, with, joy, in, later, life, he, was, known, for, his, charm, and, personal, warmth, of, his, humour, gerard, mcburney, wrote, that, it, depended, on, his, twinkling, eyes, his, perfect, timing, his, infectious, schoolboy, giggle, and, his, reckless, compulsion, always, to, say, what, the, other, person, would, not, expect, boulez, read, widely, and, identified, proust, joyce, and, kafka, as, particular, influences, he, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, the, visual, arts, he, wrote, extensively, about, the, painter, paul, klee, and, owned, works, by, joan, mir, francis, bacon, nicolas, de, sta, l, and, maria, helena, vieira, da, silva, all, of, whom, he, knew, personally, he, also, had, close, links, with, three, of, the, leading, philosophers, of, the, time, gilles, deleuze, michel, foucault, and, roland, barthes, he, was, a, keen, walker, and, when, he, was, at, home, in, baden, baden, spent, the, late, afternoons, and, much, of, the, weekends, walking, in, the, black, forest, he, owned, an, old, farmhouse, in, the, alpes, de, haute, provence, department, of, france, and, built, another, modern, home, on, the, same, land, in, the, late, 1970s, in, its, obituary, the, new, york, times, reported, that, about, his, private, life, he, remained, tightly, guarded, boulez, acknowledged, to, joan, peyser, that, there, was, a, passionate, affair, in, 1946, described, as, intense, and, tormented, and, which, peyser, suggested, was, the, trigger, for, the, wild, courageous, works, of, that, period, after, boulez, s, death, his, sister, jeanne, told, the, biographer, christian, merlin, that, the, affair, was, with, the, actress, mar, a, casares, but, merlin, concludes, that, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, this, merlin, acknowledges, the, speculation, that, boulez, was, gay, he, writes, that, in, 1972, boulez, engaged, a, young, german, hans, messner, as, his, personal, assistant, to, look, after, the, practicalities, of, his, life, messner, who, called, boulez, monsieur, and, whom, boulez, sometimes, introduced, as, his, valet, lived, in, the, baden, baden, house, until, the, end, of, boulez, s, life, and, usually, accompanied, him, when, he, travelled, abroad, although, merlin, observes, that, in, later, years, it, was, sometimes, difficult, to, tell, whether, messner, was, looking, after, boulez, or, the, other, way, round, his, view, is, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, were, ever, life, partners, towards, the, end, of, boulez, s, life, messner, blocked, boulez, s, sister, jeanne, from, visiting, the, house, he, was, with, boulez, when, he, died, in, his, portrait, for, the, new, yorker, published, shortly, after, boulez, s, death, under, the, title, the, magus, alex, ross, described, boulez, as, affable, implacable, unknowable, in, an, article, published, for, boulez, s, 80th, birthday, in, the, guardian, the, composer, george, benjamin, wrote, that, boulez, has, produced, a, catalogue, of, wondrously, luminous, and, scintillating, works, within, them, a, rigorous, compositional, skill, is, coupled, to, an, imagination, of, extraordinary, aural, refinement, by, contrast, john, adams, described, boulez, as, a, mannerist, a, niche, composer, a, master, who, worked, with, a, very, small, hammer, in, a, piece, in, the, new, york, times, to, mark, boulez, s, 90th, birthday, nico, muhly, emphasised, what, he, called, the, decadent, qualities, of, boulez, s, later, music, you, can, feel, the, butter, swirling, in, that, pan, and, when, he, conducts, it, he, teases, out, these, luxurious, textures, in, 1986, boulez, entered, into, an, agreement, to, place, his, musical, and, literary, manuscripts, with, the, paul, sacher, foundation, in, basel, switzerland, when, he, died, in, january, 2016, he, left, no, will, in, 2017, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, announced, that, his, estate, had, made, a, substantial, donation, of, private, papers, and, possessions, not, covered, by, the, sacher, contract, including, 220, metres, of, books, 50,
