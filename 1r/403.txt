the, bront, s, b, r, n, t, i, z, were, a, nineteenth, century, literary, family, born, in, the, village, of, thornton, and, later, associated, with, the, village, of, haworth, in, the, west, riding, of, yorkshire, england, the, sisters, charlotte, 1816, 1855, emily, 1818, 1848, and, anne, 1820, 1849, are, well, known, poets, and, novelists, like, many, contemporary, female, writers, they, published, their, poems, and, novels, under, male, pseudonyms, currer, ellis, and, acton, bell, their, stories, attracted, attention, for, their, passion, and, originality, immediately, following, their, publication, charlotte, s, jane, eyre, was, the, first, to, know, success, while, emily, s, wuthering, heights, anne, s, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, and, other, works, were, accepted, as, masterpieces, of, literature, after, their, deaths, the, first, bront, children, to, be, born, to, rector, patrick, bront, and, his, wife, maria, were, maria, 1814, 1825, and, elizabeth, 1815, 1825, who, both, died, at, young, ages, due, to, disease, charlotte, emily, and, anne, were, then, born, within, a, time, period, of, approximately, four, years, these, three, sisters, and, their, brother, branwell, 1817, 1848, who, had, been, born, after, charlotte, and, before, emily, were, very, close, to, each, other, as, children, they, developed, their, imaginations, first, through, oral, storytelling, and, play, set, in, an, intricate, imaginary, world, and, then, through, the, collaborative, writing, of, increasingly, complex, stories, set, in, their, fictional, world, the, deaths, of, their, mother, and, two, older, sisters, marked, them, and, influenced, their, writing, profoundly, as, did, their, isolated, upbringing, they, were, raised, in, a, religious, family, the, bront, birthplace, in, thornton, is, a, place, of, pilgrimage, and, their, later, home, the, parsonage, at, haworth, in, yorkshire, now, the, bront, parsonage, museum, has, hundreds, of, thousands, of, visitors, each, year, the, bront, family, can, be, traced, to, the, irish, clan, pronntaigh, which, literally, means, descendant, of, pronntach, they, were, a, family, of, hereditary, scribes, and, literary, men, in, fermanagh, the, version, proinntigh, which, was, first, given, by, patrick, woulfe, in, his, sloinnte, gaedheal, is, gall, transl, surnames, of, the, gael, and, the, foreigner, and, reproduced, without, question, by, edward, maclysaght, cannot, be, accepted, as, correct, as, there, were, a, number, of, well, known, scribes, with, this, name, writing, in, irish, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, all, of, them, used, the, spelling, pronntaigh, the, name, is, derived, from, the, word, pronntach, or, bronntach, which, is, related, to, the, word, bronnadh, meaning, giving, or, bestowal, pronn, is, given, as, an, ulster, version, of, bronn, in, o, reilly, s, irish, english, dictionary, patrick, woulfe, suggested, that, it, was, derived, from, proinnteach, the, refectory, of, a, monastery, pronntaigh, was, earlier, anglicised, as, prunty, and, sometimes, brunty, at, some, point, patrick, bront, born, brunty, the, sisters, father, decided, on, the, alternative, spelling, with, the, diaeresis, over, the, terminal, e, to, indicate, that, the, name, has, two, syllables, multiple, theories, exist, to, account, for, the, change, including, that, he, may, have, wished, to, hide, his, humble, origins, as, a, man, of, letters, he, would, have, been, familiar, with, classical, greek, and, may, have, chosen, the, name, after, the, greek, transl, thunder, one, view, which, biographer, c, k, shorter, proposed, in, 1896, is, that, he, adapted, his, name, to, associate, himself, with, admiral, horatio, nelson, who, was, also, duke, of, bronte, one, might, also, find, evidence, for, this, theory, in, patrick, bront, s, desire, to, associate, himself, with, the, duke, of, wellington, in, his, form, of, dress, patrick, bront, 17, march, 1777, 7, june, 1861, the, bront, sisters, father, was, born, in, loughbrickland, county, down, ireland, of, a, family, of, farm, workers, of, moderate, means, his, birth, name, was, patrick, prunty, or, brunty, his, mother, alice, mcclory, was, of, the, roman, catholic, faith, whilst, his, father, hugh, was, a, protestant, and, patrick, was, brought, up, in, his, father, s, faith, he, was, a, bright, young, man, and, after, studying, under, the, rev, thomas, tighe, won, a, scholarship, to, st, john, s, college, cambridge, there, he, studied, divinity, ancient, history, and, modern, history, attending, cambridge, may, have, made, him, feel, that, his, name, was, too, irish, and, he, changed, its, spelling, to, bront, and, its, pronunciation, accordingly, perhaps, in, honour, of, horatio, nelson, whom, patrick, admired, it, is, more, likely, however, that, his, brother, william, was, on, the, run, from, the, authorities, for, his, involvement, with, the, radical, united, irishmen, leading, patrick, to, distance, himself, from, the, name, brunty, having, obtained, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, he, was, ordained, on, 10, august, 1806, he, is, the, author, of, cottage, poems, 1811, the, rural, minstrel, 1814, numerous, pamphlets, several, newspaper, articles, and, various, rural, poems, in, 1811, patrick, was, appointed, minister, at, hartshead, cum, clifton, in, 1812, he, met, and, married, 29, year, old, maria, branwell, at, guiseley, in, 1813, they, moved, to, clough, house, hightown, liversedge, west, riding, of, yorkshire, and, by, 1820, they, had, moved, into, the, parsonage, at, haworth, where, he, took, up, the, post, of, perpetual, curate, haworth, was, an, ancient, chapelry, in, the, large, parish, of, bradford, so, he, could, not, be, rector, or, vicar, they, had, six, children, on, the, death, of, his, wife, in, 1821, his, sister, in, law, elizabeth, branwell, came, from, penzance, cornwall, to, help, him, bring, up, the, children, open, intelligent, generous, and, dedicated, to, educating, his, children, personally, he, bought, all, the, books, and, toys, the, children, desired, he, also, accorded, them, great, freedom, and, unconditional, love, although, he, may, have, alienated, them, from, the, world, due, to, his, eccentric, personal, habits, and, peculiar, theories, of, education, after, several, failed, attempts, to, remarry, patrick, accepted, permanent, widowerhood, at, the, age, of, 47, and, spent, his, time, visiting, the, sick, and, the, poor, giving, sermons, and, administering, communion, in, so, doing, he, would, often, leave, his, children, maria, elizabeth, emily, charlotte, branwell, and, anne, alone, with, elizabeth, aunt, branwell, and, a, maid, tabitha, aykroyd, tabby, tabby, helped, relieve, their, possible, boredom, and, loneliness, especially, by, recounting, local, legends, in, her, yorkshire, dialect, as, she, tirelessly, prepared, the, family, s, meals, eventually, patrick, would, survive, his, entire, family, six, years, after, charlotte, s, death, he, died, in, 1861, at, the, age, of, 84, his, son, in, law, the, rev, arthur, bell, nicholls, would, aid, mr, bront, at, the, end, of, his, life, as, well, patrick, s, wife, maria, bront, n, e, branwell, 15, april, 1783, 15, september, 1821, was, born, in, penzance, cornwall, and, came, from, a, comfortably, well, off, middle, class, family, her, father, had, a, flourishing, tea, and, grocery, store, and, had, accumulated, considerable, wealth, maria, died, at, the, age, of, 38, of, uterine, cancer, she, married, the, same, day, as, her, younger, sister, charlotte, in, the, church, at, guiseley, after, her, fianc, had, celebrated, the, union, of, two, other, couples, she, was, a, literate, and, pious, woman, known, for, her, lively, spirit, joyfulness, and, tenderness, and, it, was, she, who, designed, the, samplers, that, are, on, display, in, the, museum, and, had, them, embroidered, by, her, children, she, left, memories, with, her, husband, and, with, charlotte, the, oldest, surviving, sibling, of, a, very, vivacious, woman, the, younger, ones, particularly, emily, and, anne, admitted, to, retaining, only, vague, images, of, their, mother, especially, of, her, suffering, on, her, sickbed, elizabeth, branwell, 2, december, 1776, 29, october, 1842, arrived, from, penzance, in, 1821, aged, 45, after, her, younger, sister, maria, s, death, to, help, patrick, look, after, the, children, to, whom, she, was, known, as, aunt, branwell, elizabeth, branwell, was, a, methodist, though, it, seems, that, her, denomination, did, not, exert, any, influence, on, the, children, it, was, aunt, branwell, who, taught, the, children, arithmetic, the, alphabet, and, how, to, sew, embroider, and, cross, stitch, skills, appropriate, for, ladies, aunt, branwell, also, gave, them, books, and, subscribed, to, fraser, s, magazine, less, interesting, than, blackwood, s, but, nevertheless, providing, plenty, of, material, for, discussion, she, was, a, generous, person, who, dedicated, her, life, to, her, nieces, and, nephew, neither, marrying, nor, returning, to, visit, her, relations, in, cornwall, she, probably, told, the, children, stories, of, events, that, had, happened, in, cornwall, such, as, raids, by, pirates, in, the, eighteenth, century, who, carried, off, british, residents, to, be, enslaved, in, north, africa, and, turkey, enslavement, in, turkey, is, mentioned, by, charlotte, bront, in, jane, eyre, she, died, of, bowel, obstruction, in, october, 1842, after, a, brief, agony, during, which, she, was, comforted, by, her, beloved, nephew, branwell, in, her, last, will, aunt, branwell, left, to, her, three, nieces, the, considerable, sum, of, 900, about, 95, 700, in, 2017, currency, which, allowed, them, to, resign, from, their, low, paid, jobs, as, governesses, and, teachers, in, 1824, the, four, eldest, girls, excluding, anne, entered, the, clergy, daughters, school, at, cowan, bridge, which, educated, the, children, of, less, prosperous, members, of, the, clergy, and, had, been, recommended, to, mr, bront, the, following, year, maria, and, elizabeth, fell, gravely, ill, and, were, removed, from, the, school, later, dying, on, 6, may, and, 15, june, 1825, respectively, charlotte, and, emily, were, also, withdrawn, from, the, school, and, returned, to, haworth, charlotte, expressed, the, traumatic, impact, that, her, sisters, deaths, had, on, her, in, her, future, works, in, jane, eyre, cowan, bridge, became, lowood, maria, inspired, the, young, helen, burns, the, cruel, mistress, miss, andrews, inspired, the, headmistress, miss, scatcherd, and, the, tyrannical, headmaster, rev, carus, wilson, mr, brocklehurst, tuberculosis, which, afflicted, maria, and, elizabeth, in, 1825, also, caused, the, eventual, deaths, of, three, of, the, surviving, bront, s, branwell, in, september, 1848, emily, in, december, 1848, and, finally, anne, in, may, 1849, patrick, bront, faced, a, challenge, in, arranging, for, the, education, of, the, girls, of, his, family, which, was, barely, middle, class, they, lacked, significant, connections, and, he, could, not, afford, the, fees, for, them, to, attend, an, established, school, for, young, ladies, one, solution, was, the, schools, where, the, fees, were, reduced, to, a, minimum, so, called, charity, schools, with, a, mission, to, assist, families, like, those, of, the, lower, clergy, barker, had, read, in, the, leeds, intelligencer, of, 6, november, 1823, reports, of, cases, in, the, court, of, commons, in, bowes, he, later, read, of, other, cases, of, 24, november, 1824, near, richmond, in, the, county, of, yorkshire, where, pupils, had, been, discovered, gnawed, by, rats, and, suffering, so, badly, from, malnutrition, that, some, of, them, had, lost, their, sight, yet, for, patrick, there, was, nothing, to, suggest, that, the, reverend, carus, wilson, s, clergy, daughters, school, would, not, provide, a, good, education, and, good, care, for, his, daughters, the, school, was, not, expensive, and, its, patrons, supporters, who, allowed, the, school, to, use, their, names, were, all, respected, people, among, these, was, the, daughter, of, hannah, more, a, religious, author, and, philanthropist, who, took, a, particular, interest, in, education, more, was, a, close, friend, of, the, poet, william, cowper, who, like, her, advocated, extensive, proper, and, well, rounded, education, for, young, girls, the, pupils, included, the, offspring, of, different, prelates, and, even, certain, acquaintances, of, patrick, bront, including, william, wilberforce, young, women, whose, fathers, had, also, been, educated, at, st, john, s, college, cambridge, thus, bront, believed, wilson, s, school, to, have, many, of, the, necessary, guarantees, needed, for, his, daughters, to, receive, proper, schooling, in, 1829, 30, patrick, bront, engaged, john, bradley, an, artist, from, neighbouring, keighley, as, drawing, master, for, the, children, bradley, was, an, artist, of, some, local, repute, rather, than, a, professional, instructor, but, he, may, well, have, fostered, branwell, s, enthusiasm, for, art, and, architecture, in, 1831, fourteen, year, old, charlotte, was, enrolled, at, the, school, of, miss, wooler, in, roe, head, mirfield, patrick, could, have, sent, his, daughter, to, a, less, costly, school, in, keighley, nearer, home, but, miss, wooler, and, her, sisters, had, a, good, reputation, and, he, remembered, the, building, which, he, passed, when, strolling, around, the, parishes, of, kirklees, dewsbury, and, hartshead, cum, clifton, where, he, was, vicar, margaret, wooler, showed, fondness, towards, the, sisters, and, she, accompanied, charlotte, to, the, altar, at, her, marriage, patrick, s, choice, of, school, was, excellent, charlotte, was, happy, there, and, studied, well, she, made, many, lifelong, friends, in, particular, ellen, nussey, and, mary, taylor, who, later, went, to, new, zealand, before, returning, to, england, charlotte, returned, from, roe, head, in, june, 1832, missing, her, friends, but, happy, to, rejoin, her, family, three, years, later, miss, wooler, offered, her, former, pupil, a, position, as, her, assistant, the, family, decided, that, emily, would, accompany, her, to, pursue, studies, that, would, otherwise, have, been, unaffordable, emily, s, fees, were, partly, covered, by, charlotte, s, salary, emily, was, 17, and, it, was, the, first, time, she, had, left, haworth, since, leaving, cowan, bridge, on, 29, july, 1835, the, sisters, left, for, roe, head, the, same, day, branwell, wrote, a, letter, to, the, royal, academy, of, art, in, london, to, present, several, of, his, drawings, as, part, of, his, candidature, as, a, probationary, student, charlotte, taught, and, wrote, about, her, students, without, much, sympathy, emily, did, not, settle, after, three, months, her, health, seemed, to, decline, and, she, had, to, be, taken, home, to, the, parsonage, anne, took, her, place, and, stayed, until, christmas, 1837, charlotte, avoided, boredom, by, following, the, developments, of, the, imaginary, empire, of, angria, invented, by, charlotte, and, branwell, that, she, received, in, letters, from, her, brother, during, holidays, at, haworth, she, wrote, long, narratives, while, being, reproached, by, her, father, who, wanted, her, to, become, more, involved, in, parish, affairs, these, were, coming, to, a, head, over, the, imposition, of, the, church, of, england, rates, a, local, tax, levied, on, parishes, where, the, majority, of, the, population, were, dissenters, in, the, meantime, miss, wooler, moved, to, heald, s, house, at, dewsbury, moor, where, charlotte, complained, about, the, humidity, that, made, her, unwell, upon, leaving, the, establishment, in, 1838, miss, wooler, presented, her, with, a, parting, gift, of, the, vision, of, don, roderick, and, rokeby, a, collection, of, poems, by, walter, scott, the, children, became, interested, in, writing, from, an, early, age, initially, as, a, game, they, all, displayed, a, talent, for, narrative, but, for, the, younger, ones, it, became, a, pastime, to, develop, them, at, the, centre, of, the, children, s, creativity, were, twelve, wooden, soldiers, which, patrick, bront, gave, to, branwell, at, the, beginning, of, june, 1826, these, toy, soldiers, instantly, fired, their, imaginations, and, they, spoke, of, them, as, the, young, men, and, gave, them, names, however, it, was, not, until, december, 1827, that, their, ideas, took, written, form, and, the, imaginary, african, kingdom, of, glass, town, came, into, existence, followed, by, the, empire, of, angria, emily, and, anne, created, gondal, an, island, continent, in, the, north, pacific, ruled, by, a, woman, after, the, departure, of, charlotte, in, 1831, in, the, beginning, these, stories, were, written, in, little, books, the, size, of, a, matchbox, about, 1, 5, by, 2, 5, inches, 38, mm, 64, mm, and, cursorily, bound, with, thread, the, pages, were, filled, with, close, minute, writing, often, in, capital, letters, without, punctuation, and, embellished, with, illustrations, detailed, maps, schemes, landscapes, and, plans, of, buildings, created, by, the, children, according, to, their, specialisations, the, idea, was, that, the, books, were, of, a, size, for, the, soldiers, to, read, the, complexity, of, the, stories, matured, as, the, children, s, imaginations, developed, fed, by, reading, the, three, weekly, or, monthly, magazines, to, which, their, father, had, subscribed, or, the, newspapers, that, were, bought, daily, from, john, greenwood, s, local, news, and, stationery, store, these, fictional, worlds, were, the, product, of, fertile, imagination, fed, by, reading, discussion, and, a, passion, for, literature, far, from, suffering, from, the, negative, influences, that, never, left, them, and, which, were, reflected, in, the, works, of, their, later, more, mature, years, the, bront, children, absorbed, them, eagerly, the, periodicals, that, patrick, bront, read, were, a, mine, of, information, for, his, children, the, leeds, intelligencer, and, blackwood, s, edinburgh, magazine, conservative, and, well, written, but, better, than, the, quarterly, review, that, defended, the, same, political, ideas, whilst, addressing, a, less, refined, readership, the, reason, mr, bront, did, not, read, it, were, exploited, in, every, detail, blackwood, s, magazine, in, particular, was, not, only, the, source, of, their, knowledge, of, world, affairs, but, also, provided, material, for, the, bront, s, early, writing, for, instance, an, article, in, the, june, 1826, number, of, blackwood, s, provides, commentary, on, new, discoveries, from, the, exploration, of, central, africa, the, map, included, with, the, article, highlights, geographical, features, the, bront, s, reference, in, their, tales, the, jibbel, kumera, the, mountains, of, the, moon, ashantee, and, the, rivers, niger, and, calabar, the, author, also, advises, the, british, to, expand, into, africa, from, fernando, po, where, christine, alexander, notes, the, bront, children, locate, the, great, glass, town, their, knowledge, of, geography, was, completed, by, goldsmith, s, grammar, of, general, geography, which, the, bront, s, owned, and, annotated, heavily, from, 1833, charlotte, and, branwell, s, angrian, tales, begin, to, feature, byronic, heroes, who, have, a, strong, sexual, magnetism, and, passionate, spirit, and, demonstrate, arrogance, and, even, black, heartedness, again, it, is, in, an, article, in, blackwood, s, magazine, from, august, 1825, that, they, discover, the, poet, for, the, first, time, he, had, died, the, previous, year, from, this, moment, the, name, byron, became, synonymous, with, all, the, prohibitions, and, audacities, as, if, it, had, stirred, up, the, very, essence, of, the, rise, of, those, forbidden, things, branwell, s, charlotte, zamorna, one, of, the, heroes, of, verdopolis, tends, towards, increasingly, ambiguous, behaviour, and, the, same, influence, and, evolution, recur, with, the, bront, s, especially, in, the, characters, of, heathcliff, in, wuthering, heights, and, mr, rochester, in, jane, eyre, who, display, the, traits, of, a, byronic, hero, numerous, other, works, left, their, mark, on, the, bront, s, the, thousand, and, one, nights, for, example, which, inspired, jinn, in, which, they, became, themselves, in, the, centre, of, their, kingdoms, while, adding, a, touch, of, exoticism, the, children, s, imagination, was, also, influenced, by, three, prints, of, engravings, in, mezzotint, by, john, martin, around, 1820, charlotte, and, branwell, made, copies, of, the, prints, belshazzar, s, feast, d, luge, and, joshua, commanding, the, sun, to, stand, still, upon, gibeon, 1816, which, hung, on, the, walls, of, the, parsonage, martin, s, fantastic, architecture, is, reflected, in, the, glass, town, and, angrian, writings, where, he, appears, himself, among, branwell, s, characters, and, under, the, name, of, edward, de, lisle, the, greatest, painter, and, portraitist, of, verdopolis, the, capital, of, glass, town, one, of, sir, edward, de, lisle, s, major, works, les, quatre, genii, en, conseil, is, inspired, by, martin, s, illustration, for, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, together, with, byron, john, martin, seems, to, have, been, one, of, the, artistic, influences, essential, to, the, bront, s, universe, the, influence, revealed, by, agnes, grey, and, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, is, much, less, clear, anne, s, works, are, largely, founded, on, her, experience, as, a, governess, and, on, that, of, her, brother, s, decline, furthermore, they, demonstrate, her, conviction, a, legacy, from, her, father, that, books, should, provide, moral, education, this, sense, of, moral, duty, and, the, need, to, record, it, are, more, evident, in, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, the, influence, of, the, gothic, novels, of, ann, radcliffe, horace, walpole, gregory, monk, lewis, and, charles, maturin, is, noticeable, and, that, of, walter, scott, too, if, only, because, the, heroine, abandoned, and, left, alone, resists, importunities, not, only, through, her, almost, supernatural, talents, but, by, her, powerful, temperament, jane, eyre, agnes, grey, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, shirley, villette, and, even, the, professor, present, a, linear, structure, concerning, characters, who, advance, through, life, after, several, trials, and, tribulations, to, find, a, kind, of, happiness, in, love, and, virtue, recalling, works, of, religious, inspiration, of, the, 17th, century, such, as, john, bunyan, s, the, pilgrim, s, progress, or, his, grace, abounding, to, the, chief, of, sinners, in, a, more, profane, manner, the, hero, or, heroine, follows, a, picaresque, itinerary, such, as, in, miguel, de, cervantes, 1547, 1616, daniel, defoe, 1660, 1731, henry, fielding, 1707, 1764, and, tobias, smollett, 1721, 1771, this, lively, tradition, continued, into, the, 19th, century, with, the, rags, to, riches, genre, to, which, almost, all, the, great, victorian, romancers, have, contributed, the, protagonist, is, thrown, by, fate, into, poverty, and, after, many, difficulties, achieves, a, golden, happiness, often, an, artifice, is, employed, to, effect, the, passage, from, one, state, to, another, such, as, an, unexpected, inheritance, a, miraculous, gift, grand, reunions, etc, and, in, a, sense, it, is, the, route, followed, by, charlotte, s, and, anne, s, protagonists, even, if, the, riches, they, win, are, more, those, of, the, heart, than, of, the, wallet, apart, from, its, gothic, elements, wuthering, heights, moves, like, a, greek, tragedy, and, possesses, its, music, the, cosmic, dimensions, of, the, epics, of, john, milton, and, the, power, of, the, shakespearian, theatre, one, can, hear, the, echoes, of, king, lear, as, well, as, the, completely, different, characters, of, romeo, and, juliet, the, bront, s, were, also, seduced, by, the, writings, of, walter, scott, and, in, 1834, charlotte, exclaimed, for, fiction, read, walter, scott, and, only, him, all, novels, after, his, are, without, value, through, their, father, s, influence, and, their, own, intellectual, curiosity, they, were, able, to, benefit, from, an, education, that, placed, them, among, knowledgeable, people, but, mr, bront, s, emoluments, were, modest, the, only, options, open, to, the, girls, were, either, marriage, or, a, choice, between, the, professions, of, school,

possibility, of, becoming, a, paid, companion, to, a, rich, and, solitary, woman, might, have, been, a, fall, back, role, but, one, that, would, have, probably, bored, any, of, the, sisters, intolerably, janet, todd, s, mary, wollstonecraft, a, revolutionary, life, mentions, the, predicament, only, emily, never, became, a, governess, her, sole, professional, experience, would, be, an, experiment, in, teaching, during, six, months, of, intolerable, exile, in, miss, patchett, s, school, at, law, hill, between, haworth, and, halifax, in, contrast, charlotte, had, teaching, positions, at, miss, margaret, wooler, s, school, and, in, brussels, with, the, h, gers, she, became, governess, to, the, sidgwicks, the, stonegappes, and, the, lotherdales, where, she, worked, for, several, months, in, 1839, then, with, mrs, white, at, upperhouse, house, rawdon, from, march, to, september, 1841, anne, became, a, governess, and, worked, for, mrs, ingham, at, blake, hall, mirfield, from, april, to, december, 1839, then, for, mrs, robinson, at, thorp, green, hall, little, ouseburn, near, york, where, she, also, obtained, employment, for, her, brother, in, a, futile, attempt, to, stabilise, him, the, family, s, finances, did, not, flourish, and, aunt, branwell, spent, the, money, with, caution, emily, had, a, visceral, need, of, her, home, and, the, countryside, that, surrounded, it, and, to, leave, it, would, cause, her, to, languish, and, wither, charlotte, and, anne, being, more, realistic, did, not, hesitate, in, finding, work, and, from, april, 1839, to, december, 1841, the, two, sisters, had, several, posts, as, governesses, not, staying, long, with, each, family, their, employment, would, last, for, some, months, or, a, single, season, however, anne, did, stay, with, the, robinsons, in, thorp, green, where, things, went, well, from, may, 1840, to, june, 1845, in, the, meantime, charlotte, had, an, idea, that, would, place, all, the, advantages, on, her, side, on, advice, from, her, father, and, friends, she, thought, that, she, and, her, sisters, had, the, intellectual, capacity, to, create, a, school, for, young, girls, in, the, parsonage, where, their, sunday, school, classes, took, place, it, was, agreed, to, offer, the, future, pupils, the, opportunity, of, correctly, learning, modern, languages, and, that, preparation, for, this, should, be, done, abroad, which, led, to, a, further, decision, among, the, possibilities, paris, and, lille, were, considered, but, were, rejected, due, to, aversion, to, the, french, indeed, the, french, revolution, and, the, napoleonic, wars, had, not, been, forgotten, by, the, tory, spirited, and, deeply, conservative, girls, on, the, recommendation, of, a, pastor, based, in, brussels, who, wanted, to, be, of, help, belgium, was, chosen, where, they, could, also, study, german, and, music, aunt, branwell, provided, the, funds, for, the, brussels, project, emily, and, charlotte, arrived, in, brussels, in, february, 1842, accompanied, by, their, father, once, there, they, enrolled, at, monsieur, and, madame, h, ger, s, boarding, school, in, the, rue, d, isabelle, for, six, months, claire, h, ger, was, the, second, wife, of, constantin, and, it, was, she, who, founded, and, directed, the, school, while, constantin, had, the, responsibility, for, the, higher, french, classes, according, to, miss, wheelwright, a, former, pupil, he, had, the, intellect, of, a, genius, he, was, passionate, about, his, auditorium, demanding, many, lectures, perspectives, and, structured, analyses, he, was, also, a, good, looking, man, with, regular, features, bushy, hair, very, black, whiskers, and, wore, an, excited, expression, while, sounding, forth, on, great, authors, about, whom, he, invited, his, students, to, make, a, pastiche, on, general, or, philosophical, themes, the, lessons, especially, those, of, constantin, h, ger, were, very, much, appreciated, by, charlotte, and, the, two, sisters, showed, exceptional, intelligence, although, emily, hardly, liked, her, teacher, and, was, somewhat, rebellious, emily, learned, german, and, to, play, the, piano, with, natural, brilliance, and, very, quickly, the, two, sisters, were, writing, literary, and, philosophical, essays, in, an, advanced, level, of, french, after, six, months, of, study, mme, h, ger, suggested, they, stay, at, the, boarding, school, free, of, charge, in, return, for, giving, some, lessons, after, much, hesitation, the, girls, accepted, neither, of, them, felt, particularly, attached, to, their, students, and, only, one, mademoiselle, de, bassompierre, then, aged, 16, later, expressed, any, affection, for, her, teacher, emily, which, appeared, to, be, mutual, and, made, her, a, gift, of, a, signed, detailed, drawing, of, a, storm, ravaged, pine, tree, the, death, of, their, aunt, in, october, of, the, same, year, forced, them, to, return, once, more, to, haworth, aunt, branwell, had, left, all, her, worldly, goods, in, equal, shares, to, her, nieces, and, to, eliza, kingston, a, cousin, in, penzance, which, had, the, immediate, effect, of, purging, all, their, debts, and, providing, a, small, reserve, of, funds, nevertheless, they, were, asked, to, return, to, the, heger, s, boarding, school, in, brussels, as, they, were, regarded, as, being, competent, and, were, needed, they, were, each, offered, teaching, posts, in, the, boarding, school, english, for, charlotte, and, music, for, emily, however, charlotte, returned, alone, to, belgium, in, january, 1843, emily, remained, critical, of, monsieur, heger, in, spite, of, the, excellent, opinion, he, held, of, her, he, later, stated, that, she, had, the, spirit, of, a, man, and, would, probably, become, a, great, traveller, due, to, her, being, gifted, with, a, superior, faculty, of, reason, that, allowed, her, to, deduce, ancient, knowledge, from, new, spheres, of, knowledge, and, her, unbending, willpower, would, have, triumphed, over, all, obstacles, almost, a, year, to, the, day, enamoured, for, some, time, for, monsieur, h, ger, charlotte, resigned, and, returned, to, haworth, her, life, at, the, school, had, not, been, without, suffering, and, on, one, occasion, she, ventured, into, the, cathedral, and, entered, a, confessional, she, may, have, had, intention, of, converting, to, catholicism, but, it, would, only, have, been, for, a, short, time, during, her, absence, life, at, haworth, had, become, more, difficult, mr, bront, had, lost, his, sight, although, his, cataract, had, been, operated, on, with, success, in, manchester, and, it, was, there, in, august, 1846, when, charlotte, arrived, at, his, bedside, that, she, began, to, write, jane, eyre, meanwhile, her, brother, branwell, fell, into, a, rapid, decline, punctuated, by, dramas, drunkenness, and, delirium, due, partly, to, branwell, s, poor, reputation, the, school, project, failed, and, was, abandoned, charlotte, wrote, four, long, very, personal, and, sometimes, vague, letters, to, monsieur, h, ger, that, never, received, replies, the, extent, of, charlotte, bront, s, feelings, for, h, ger, were, not, fully, realised, until, 1913, when, her, letters, to, him, were, published, for, the, first, time, h, ger, had, first, shown, them, to, mrs, gaskell, when, she, visited, him, in, 1856, while, researching, her, biography, the, life, of, charlotte, bront, but, she, concealed, their, true, significance, these, letters, referred, to, as, the, h, ger, letters, had, been, ripped, up, at, some, stage, by, h, ger, but, his, wife, had, retrieved, the, pieces, from, the, wastepaper, bin, and, meticulously, glued, or, sewn, them, back, together, paul, h, ger, constantin, s, son, and, his, sisters, gave, these, letters, to, the, british, museum, and, they, were, shortly, thereafter, printed, in, the, times, newspaper, the, writing, that, had, begun, so, early, never, left, the, family, charlotte, had, ambition, like, her, brother, and, wrote, to, the, poet, laureate, robert, southey, to, submit, several, poems, in, his, style, though, branwell, was, kept, at, a, distance, from, her, project, she, received, a, hardly, encouraging, reply, after, several, months, southey, still, illustrious, today, although, his, star, has, somewhat, waned, was, one, of, the, great, figures, of, english, romanticism, along, with, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, he, shared, the, prejudice, of, the, times, literature, or, more, particularly, poetry, for, women, had, been, publishing, fiction, and, enjoying, critical, popular, and, economic, success, for, over, a, century, by, this, time, was, considered, a, man, s, business, and, not, an, appropriate, occupation, for, ladies, however, charlotte, did, not, allow, herself, to, be, discouraged, furthermore, coincidence, came, to, her, aid, one, day, in, autumn, 1845, while, alone, in, the, dining, room, she, noticed, a, small, notebook, lying, open, in, the, drawer, of, emily, s, portable, writing, desk, and, of, my, sister, emily, s, handwriting, she, read, it, and, was, dazzled, by, the, beauty, of, the, poems, that, she, did, not, know, the, discovery, of, this, treasure, was, what, she, recalled, five, years, later, and, according, to, juliet, barker, she, erased, the, excitement, that, she, had, felt, more, than, surprise, a, deep, conviction, that, these, were, not, common, effusions, nor, at, all, like, the, poetry, women, generally, write, i, thought, them, condensed, and, terse, vigorous, and, genuine, to, my, ear, they, had, a, peculiar, music, wild, melancholy, and, elevating, in, the, following, paragraph, charlotte, describes, her, sister, s, indignant, reaction, at, her, having, ventured, into, such, an, intimate, realm, with, impunity, it, took, emily, hours, to, calm, down, and, days, to, be, convinced, to, publish, the, poems, charlotte, envisaged, a, joint, publication, by, the, three, sisters, anne, was, easily, won, over, to, the, project, and, the, work, was, shared, compared, and, edited, once, the, poems, had, been, chosen, nineteen, for, charlotte, and, twenty, one, each, for, anne, and, emily, charlotte, went, about, searching, for, a, publisher, she, took, advice, from, william, and, robert, chambers, of, edinburgh, directors, of, one, of, their, favourite, magazines, chambers, s, edinburgh, journal, it, is, thought, although, no, documents, exist, to, support, the, claim, that, they, advised, the, sisters, to, contact, aylott, jones, a, small, publishing, house, at, 8, paternoster, row, london, who, accepted, but, at, the, authors, own, risk, since, they, felt, the, commercial, risk, to, the, company, was, too, great, the, work, thus, appeared, in, 1846, published, using, the, male, pseudonyms, of, currer, charlotte, ellis, emily, and, acton, anne, bell, these, were, very, uncommon, forenames, but, the, initials, of, each, of, the, sisters, were, preserved, and, the, patronym, could, have, been, inspired, by, that, of, the, vicar, of, the, parish, arthur, bell, nicholls, it, was, in, fact, on, 18, may, 1845, that, he, took, up, his, duties, at, haworth, at, the, moment, when, the, publication, project, was, well, advanced, the, book, attracted, hardly, any, attention, only, three, copies, were, sold, of, which, one, was, purchased, by, fredrick, enoch, a, resident, of, cornmarket, warwick, who, in, admiration, wrote, to, the, publisher, to, request, an, autograph, the, only, extant, single, document, carrying, the, three, authors, signatures, in, their, pseudonyms, and, they, continued, creating, their, prose, each, one, producing, a, book, a, year, later, each, worked, in, secret, unceasingly, discussing, their, writing, for, hours, at, the, dinner, table, after, which, their, father, would, open, the, door, at, 9, p, m, with, don, t, stay, up, late, girls, then, rewinding, the, clock, and, taking, the, stairs, up, to, his, room, charlotte, s, jane, eyre, emily, s, wuthering, heights, and, anne, s, agnes, grey, appeared, in, 1847, after, many, tribulations, again, for, reasons, of, finding, a, publisher, the, packets, containing, the, manuscripts, were, often, returned, to, the, parsonage, and, charlotte, simply, added, a, new, address, she, did, this, at, least, a, dozen, times, during, the, year, the, first, one, was, finally, published, by, smith, elder, co, in, london, the, 23, year, old, owner, george, smith, had, specialised, in, publishing, scientific, revues, aided, by, his, perspicacious, reader, william, smith, williams, emily, and, anne, s, manuscripts, were, confided, to, thomas, cautley, newby, who, intended, to, compile, a, three, decker, more, economical, for, sale, and, for, loan, in, the, circulating, libraries, the, two, first, volumes, included, wuthering, heights, and, the, third, one, agnes, grey, both, novels, attracted, critical, acclaim, occasionally, harsh, about, wuthering, heights, praised, for, the, originality, of, the, subject, and, its, narrative, style, but, viewed, with, suspicion, because, of, its, outrageous, violence, and, immorality, surely, the, critics, wrote, a, work, of, a, man, with, a, depraved, mind, critics, were, fairly, neutral, about, agnes, grey, but, more, flattering, for, jane, eyre, which, soon, became, a, best, seller, despite, some, commentators, denouncing, it, as, an, affront, to, good, morals, the, pseudonymous, currer, bell, publication, in, 1847, of, jane, eyre, an, autobiography, established, a, dazzling, reputation, for, charlotte, in, july, 1848, charlotte, and, anne, emily, had, refused, to, go, along, with, them, travelled, by, train, to, london, to, prove, to, smith, elder, co, that, each, sister, was, indeed, an, independent, author, for, thomas, cautley, newby, the, publisher, of, wuthering, heights, and, agnes, grey, had, launched, a, rumour, that, the, three, novels, were, the, work, of, one, author, understood, to, be, ellis, bell, emily, george, smith, was, extremely, surprised, to, find, two, gawky, ill, dressed, country, girls, paralysed, with, fear, who, to, identify, themselves, held, out, the, letters, addressed, to, messrs, acton, currer, and, ellis, bell, taken, by, such, surprise, he, introduced, them, to, his, mother, with, all, the, dignity, their, talent, merited, and, invited, them, to, the, opera, for, a, performance, of, rossini, s, barber, of, seville, emily, bront, s, wuthering, heights, was, published, in, 1847, under, the, masculine, pseudonym, ellis, bell, by, thomas, cautley, newby, in, two, companion, volumes, to, that, of, anne, s, acton, bell, agnes, grey, controversial, from, the, start, of, its, release, its, originality, its, subject, narrative, style, and, troubled, action, raised, intrigue, certain, critics, condemned, it, but, sales, were, nevertheless, considerable, for, an, unknown, author, of, a, novel, that, defied, all, conventions, it, is, a, work, of, black, romanticism, covering, three, generations, isolated, in, the, cold, spring, of, the, countryside, with, two, opposing, elements, the, dignified, manor, of, thrushcross, grange, and, the, rambling, dilapidated, pile, of, wuthering, heights, the, main, characters, swept, by, tumults, of, the, earth, the, skies, and, the, hearts, are, strange, and, often, possessed, of, unheard, of, violence, and, deprivations, the, story, is, told, in, a, scholarly, fashion, with, two, narrators, the, traveller, and, tenant, lockwood, and, the, housekeeper, governess, nelly, dean, with, two, sections, in, the, first, person, one, direct, one, cloaked, which, overlap, each, other, with, digressions, and, sub, plots, that, form, from, apparently, scattered, fragments, a, coherently, locked, unit, one, year, before, her, death, in, may, 1849, anne, published, a, second, novel, far, more, ambitious, than, her, previous, novel, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, was, a, great, success, and, rapidly, outsold, emily, s, wuthering, heights, however, the, critical, reception, was, mixed, praise, for, the, novel, s, power, and, effect, and, sharp, criticism, for, being, coarse, charlotte, bront, herself, anne, s, sister, wrote, to, her, publisher, that, it, hardly, seems, to, me, desirable, to, preserve, the, choice, of, subject, in, that, work, is, a, mistake, after, anne, s, death, charlotte, prevented, the, novel, s, republication, and, thus, condemned, her, sister, to, temporary, oblivion, the, master, theme, is, the, alcoholism, of, a, man, who, causes, the, downfall, of, his, family, helen, graham, the, central, character, gets, married, for, love, to, arthur, huntingdon, whom, she, soon, discovers, to, be, lecherous, violent, and, alcoholic, she, is, forced, to, break, with, the, conventions, that, would, keep, her, in, the, family, home, that, has, become, hell, and, to, leave, with, her, child, to, seek, secret, refuge, in, the, old, house, of, wildfell, hall, when, the, alcohol, causes, her, husband, s, ultimate, decline, she, returns, to, care, for, him, in, total, abnegation, until, his, death, today, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, is, considered, by, most, of, the, critics, to, be, one, of, the, first, sustained, feminist, novels, in, 1850, a, little, over, a, year, after, the, deaths, of, emily, and, anne, charlotte, wrote, a, preface, for, the, re, print, of, the, combined, edition, of, wuthering, heights, and, agnes, grey, in, which, she, publicly, revealed, the, real, identities, of, all, three, sisters, conditions, at, the, school, at, cowan, bridge, where, maria, and, elizabeth, may, have, contracted, the, tuberculosis, from, which, they, died, were, probably, no, worse, than, those, at, many, other, schools, of, the, time, for, example, several, decades, before, the, bront, sisters, experience, at, cowan, bridge, jane, austen, and, her, sister, cassandra, contracted, typhus, at, a, similar, boarding, school, and, jane, nearly, died, the, austen, sisters, education, like, that, of, the, bront, sisters, was, continued, at, home, nevertheless, charlotte, blamed, cowan, bridge, for, her, sisters, deaths, especially, its, poor, medical, care, chiefly, repeated, emetics, and, blood, lettings, and, the, negligence, of, the, school, s, doctor, who, was, the, director, s, brother, in, law, charlotte, s, vivid, memories, of, the, privations, at, cowan, bridge, were, poured, into, her, depiction, of, lowood, school, in, jane, eyre, the, scanty, and, often, spoiled, food, the, lack, of, heating, and, adequate, clothing, the, periodic, epidemics, of, illness, such, as, low, fever, probably, typhus, the, severity, and, arbitrariness, of, the, punishments, and, even, the, harshness, of, particular, teachers, a, miss, andrews, who, taught, at, cowan, bridge, is, thought, to, have, been, charlotte, s, model, for, miss, scatcherd, in, jane, eyre, elizabeth, gaskell, a, personal, friend, and, the, first, biographer, of, charlotte, confirmed, that, cowan, bridge, was, charlotte, s, model, for, lowood, and, insisted, that, conditions, there, in, charlotte, s, day, were, egregious, more, recent, biographers, have, argued, that, the, food, clothing, heating, medical, care, and, discipline, at, cowan, bridge, were, not, considered, sub, standard, for, religious, schools, of, the, time, testaments, of, the, era, s, complacency, about, these, intolerable, conditions, one, scholar, has, commended, patrick, bront, for, his, perspicacity, in, removing, all, his, daughters, from, the, school, a, few, weeks, before, the, deaths, of, maria, and, elizabeth, following, the, overwhelming, success, of, jane, eyre, charlotte, was, pressured, by, george, smith, her, publisher, to, travel, to, london, to, meet, her, public, despite, the, extreme, timidity, that, paralysed, her, among, strangers, and, made, her, almost, incapable, of, expressing, herself, charlotte, consented, to, be, lionised, and, in, london, was, introduced, to, other, great, writers, of, the, era, including, harriet, martineau, and, william, makepeace, thackeray, both, of, whom, befriended, her, charlotte, especially, admired, thackeray, whose, portrait, given, to, her, by, smith, still, hangs, in, the, dining, room, at, haworth, parsonage, on, one, occasion, during, a, public, gathering, thackeray, introduced, charlotte, to, his, mother, as, jane, eyre, and, when, charlotte, called, on, him, the, next, day, he, received, an, extended, dressing, down, in, which, smith, had, to, intervene, during, her, trip, to, london, in, 1851, she, visited, the, great, exhibition, and, the, crystal, palace, in, 1849, she, published, shirley, and, in, 1853, villette, the, bront, sisters, were, highly, amused, by, the, behaviour, of, the, curates, they, met, arthur, bell, nicholls, 1818, 1906, had, been, curate, of, haworth, for, seven, and, a, half, years, when, contrary, to, all, expectations, and, to, the, fury, of, patrick, bront, their, father, he, proposed, to, charlotte, although, impressed, by, his, dignity, and, deep, voice, as, well, as, by, his, near, complete, emotional, collapse, when, she, rejected, him, she, found, him, rigid, conventional, and, rather, narrow, minded, like, all, the, curates, as, she, wrote, to, ellen, nussey, after, she, declined, his, proposal, nicholls, pursued, by, the, anger, of, patrick, bront, left, his, functions, for, several, months, however, little, by, little, her, feelings, evolved, and, after, slowly, convincing, her, father, she, finally, married, nicholls, on, 29, june, 1854, on, return, from, their, honeymoon, in, ireland, where, she, had, been, introduced, to, mr, nicholls, aunt, and, cousins, her, life, completely, changed, she, adopted, her, new, duties, as, a, wife, which, took, up, most, of, her, time, she, wrote, to, her, friends, telling, them, that, nicholls, was, a, good, and, attentive, husband, but, that, she, nevertheless, felt, a, kind, of, holy, terror, at, her, new, situation, in, a, letter, to, ellen, nussey, nell, in, 1854, she, wrote, indeed, indeed, nell, it, is, a, solemn, and, strange, and, perilous, thing, for, a, woman, to, become, a, wife, the, following, year, she, died, aged, 38, the, cause, of, death, given, at, the, time, was, tuberculosis, but, it, may, have, been, complicated, with, typhoid, fever, the, water, at, haworth, being, likely, contaminated, due, to, poor, sanitation, and, the, vast, cemetery, that, surrounded, the, church, and, the, parsonage, and, hyperemesis, gravidarum, from, her, pregnancy, that, was, in, its, early, stage, the, first, biography, of, charlotte, was, written, by, elizabeth, cleghorn, gaskell, at, the, request, of, patrick, bront, and, published, in, 1857, helping, to, create, the, myth, of, a, family, of, condemned, genius, living, in, a, painful, and, romantic, solitude, after, having, stayed, at, haworth, several, times, and, having, accommodated, charlotte, in, plymouth, grove, manchester, and, having, become, her, friend, and, confidant, mrs, gaskell, certainly, had, the, advantage, of, knowing, the, family, these, are, outlines, or, unedited, roughcasts, which, with, the, exception, of, emma, have, been, recently, published, patrick, branwell, bront, 1817, 1848, was, considered, by, his, father, and, sisters, to, be, a, genius, while, the, book, by, daphne, du, maurier, 1986, the, infernal, world, of, branwell, bront, contains, numerous, references, to, his, addiction, to, alcohol, and, laudanum, he, was, an, intelligent, boy, with, many, talents, and, interested, in, many, subjects, especially, literature, he, was, often, the, driving, force, in, the, bront, siblings, construction, of, the, imaginary, worlds, he, was, artistic, and, was, encouraged, by, his, father, to, pursue, this, while, trying, to, make, a, name, as, an, artist, he, left, for, london, but, used, up, his, father, s, allowance, in, a, matter, of, days, in, caf, s, of, ill, repute, his, attempts, to, obtain, low, paid, work, failed, and, very, quickly, he, foundered, in, alcohol, and, laudanum, unable, to, regain, his, stability, anne, bront, obtained, employment, for, him, in, january, 1843, but, nearly, three, years, later, he, was, dismissed, in, september, 1848, after, several, years, of, decline, he, died, from, tuberculosis, on, his, death, his, father, tearfully, repeated, my,

his, sister, charlotte, glass, town, angria, poems, pieces, of, prose, and, verse, under, the, pseudonym, of, northangerland, such, as, real, rest, published, by, the, halifax, guardian, 8, november,

been, called, the, sphinx, of, literature, writing, without, the, slightest, desire, for, fame, and, only, for, her, own, satisfaction, she, was, obsessively, timid, outside, the, family, circle, to, the, point, of, turning, her, back, on, her, partners, in, conversation, without, saying, a, word, with, a, single, novel, wuthering, heights, 1847, and, poems, with, an, elemental, power, she, reached, the, heights, of, literature, though, she, was, almost, unknown, during, her, life, posterity, classes, her, as, top, level, in, the, literary, canon, of, english, literature, simone, de, beauvoir, in, the, second, sex, 1949, chooses, only, emily, bront, virginia, woolf, and, sometimes, mary, webb, colette, and, mansfield, as, among, those, who, have, tried, to, approach, nature, in, its, inhuman, freedom, above, all, emily, loved, to, wander, about, the, wild, landscape, of, the, moors, around, haworth, in, september, 1848, her, health, began, to, decline, rapidly, consumptive, she, refused, all, treatment, with, the, exception, of, a, visit, from, a, london, doctor, because, although, it, was, already, too, late, her, relatives, insisted, despite, popular, belief, emily, did, not, die, on, the, dining, room, sofa, there, is, no, contemporary, evidence, for, the, story, and, charlotte, in, her, letter, to, william, smith, williams, mentions, emily, s, dog, keeper, lying, at, the, side, of, her, death, bed, it, is, possible, that, she, left, an, unfinished, manuscript, that, charlotte, burned, to, avoid, such, controversy, as, followed, the, publication, of, wuthering, heights, several, documents, exist, that, allude, to, the, possibility, although, no, proof, corroborating, this, suggestion, has, ever, been, found, emily, s, poems, were, probably, written, to, be, inserted, in, the, saga, of, gondal, several, of, whose, characters, she, identified, with, right, into, adulthood, at, the, age, of, 28, she, still, acted, out, scenes, from, the, little, books, with, anne, while, travelling, on, the, train, to, york, remembrance, was, one, of, the, 21, of, her, poems, that, were, chosen, for, 1846, joint, publication, with, her, siblings, anne, was, not, as, celebrated, as, her, other, two, sisters, her, second, novel, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, was, prevented, from, being, republished, after, anne, s, death, by, her, sister, charlotte, who, wrote, to, her, publisher, that, it, hardly, appears, to, me, desirable, to, preserve, the, choice, of, subject, in, that, work, is, a, mistake, it, was, too, little, consonant, with, the, character, tastes, and, ideas, of, the, gentle, retiring, inexperienced, writer, this, prevention, is, considered, to, be, the, main, reason, for, anne, s, being, less, renowned, than, her, sisters, anne, s, health, began, to, decline, rapidly, like, that, of, her, brother, and, sister, some, months, earlier, on, 5, april, 1849, she, wrote, to, ellen, nussey, asking, her, to, accompany, her, to, scarborough, on, the, east, coast, anne, confides, her, thoughts, to, ellen, i, have, no, horror, of, death, if, i, thought, it, inevitable, i, think, i, could, quietly, resign, myself, to, the, prospect, but, i, wish, it, would, please, god, to, spare, me, not, only, for, papa, s, and, charlotte, s, sakes, but, because, i, long, to, do, some, good, in, the, world, before, i, leave, it, i, have, many, schemes, in, my, head, for, future, practise, humble, and, limited, indeed, but, still, i, should, not, like, them, all, to, come, to, nothing, and, myself, to, have, lived, to, so, little, purpose, but, god, s, will, be, done, anne, hoped, that, the, sea, air, would, improve, her, health, as, recommended, by, the, doctor, and, charlotte, agreed, to, go, on, the, sunday, morning, she, felt, weaker, and, asked, if, she, could, be, taken, back, to, haworth, the, doctor, confirmed, that, she, was, near, to, death, and, anne, thanked, him, for, his, candour, take, courage, take, courage, she, murmured, to, charlotte, she, died, at, 2, pm, on, monday, 28, may, she, is, buried, in, the, cemetery, of, st, mary, s, of, scarborough, her, gravestone, inscription, carried, an, error, in, her, age, she, died, at, the, age, of, 29, and, not, at, 28, it, was, noticed, by, charlotte, during, her, only, visit, and, she, had, the, intention, of, asking, the, mason, to, correct, it, ill, health, did, not, leave, him, time, to, effect, the, repair, and, the, tombstone, remained, in, the, same, state, until, it, was, replaced, by, the, bront, society, in, april, 2013, in, her, 1857, biography, the, life, of, charlotte, bront, mrs, gaskell, begins, with, two, explanatory, and, descriptive, chapters, the, first, one, covers, the, wild, countryside, of, the, west, riding, of, yorkshire, the, little, village, of, haworth, the, parsonage, and, the, church, surrounded, by, its, vast, cemetery, perched, on, the, top, of, a, hill, the, second, chapter, presents, an, overview, of, the, social, sanitary, and, economic, conditions, of, the, region, the, death, toll, within, the, bront, family, was, not, unusual, for, the, area, and, left, little, impression, on, the, village, population, who, were, confronted, with, death, on, a, daily, basis, when, patrick, bront, arrived, the, parish, was, suffering, from, unemployment, the, men, sought, work, in, the, quarries, and, local, handicrafts, the, only, businesses, were, the, pharmacy, which, supplied, branwell, and, john, greenwood, s, stationery, store, where, the, bront, s, were, the, best, customers, haworth, s, population, grew, rapidly, during, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, from, hardly, 1, 000, to, 3, 365, in, 50, years, the, village, did, not, have, a, sewage, system, and, the, well, water, was, contaminated, by, faecal, matter, and, the, decomposition, of, bodies, in, the, cemetery, on, the, hilltop, life, expectancy, was, less, than, 25, years, and, infant, mortality, was, around, 41, for, children, under, six, months, of, age, most, of, the, population, lived, by, working, the, poorly, fertile, land, of, the, moors, and, supplemented, their, incomes, with, work, done, at, home, such, as, spinning, and, weaving, wool, from, the, sheep, that, were, farmed, on, the, moors, conditions, changed, when, the, textile, industry, already, present, since, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, grew, with, the, mills, being, located, on, the, banks, of, the, river, worth, whose, waters, turned, the, wheels, consequently, fewer, people, were, needed, to, work, them, food, was, scarce, often, little, more, than, porridge, resulting, in, vitamin, deficiencies, public, hygiene, was, non, existent, and, lavatories, were, basic, the, facilities, at, the, parsonage, were, no, more, than, a, plank, across, a, hole, in, a, hut, at, the, rear, with, a, lower, plank, for, the, children, in, her, thirties, charlotte, was, described, as, having, a, toothless, jaw, by, such, persons, as, mrs, gaskell, who, stated, in, a, letter, dated, 25, august, 1850, to, catherine, winkworth, large, mouth, and, many, teeth, gone, however, food, was, reasonably, plentiful, in, the, family, they, ate, from, well, filled, plates, of, porridge, in, the, morning, and, piles, of, potatoes, were, peeled, each, day, in, the, kitchen, while, tabby, told, stories, about, her, country, or, emily, revised, her, german, grammar, sometimes, mr, bront, would, return, home, from, his, tours, of, the, village, with, game, donated, by, the, parishioners, according, to, robert, southey, poet, laureate, in, his, response, to, charlotte, ladies, from, a, good, background, should, be, content, with, an, education, and, a, marriage, embellished, with, some, decorative, talents, mr, patrick, bront, had, one, of, the, characters, in, his, the, maid, of, kilarney, without, knowing, whether, it, reflected, a, widespread, opinion, supporting, or, condemning, it, say, the, education, of, female, ought, most, assuredly, to, be, competent, in, order, that, she, might, enjoy, herself, and, be, a, fit, companion, for, man, but, believe, me, lovely, delicate, and, sprightly, woman, is, not, formed, by, nature, to, pore, over, the, musty, pages, of, grecian, and, roman, literature, or, to, plod, through, the, windings, of, mathematical, problems, nor, has, providence, assigned, for, her, sphere, of, action, either, the, cabinet, or, the, field, her, forte, is, softness, tenderness, and, grace, in, any, case, it, seemed, to, contradict, his, attitude, towards, his, daughters, whom, he, encouraged, even, if, he, was, not, completely, aware, of, what, they, did, with, their, time, due, to, their, forced, or, voluntary, isolation, the, bront, sisters, constituted, a, separate, literary, group, that, neither, had, predecessors, nor, successors, there, is, not, a, bront, line, such, as, exists, among, authors, of, realist, and, naturalist, novels, or, in, poetry, the, romantic, and, the, symbolic, their, influence, certainly, existed, but, it, is, difficult, to, define, in, its, totality, writers, who, followed, them, doubtlessly, thought, about, them, while, they, were, creating, their, dark, and, tormented, worlds, such, as, thomas, hardy, in, jude, the, obscure, or, tess, of, the, d, urbervilles, or, george, eliot, with, adam, bede, and, the, mill, on, the, floss, there, were, also, more, conventional, authors, such, as, matthew, arnold, who, in, a, letter, from, 1853, says, of, charlotte, that, she, only, pretends, to, heartlessness, nothing, but, hunger, rebellion, and, rage, in, contrast, mrs, humphry, ward, author, of, robert, elsmere, and, other, morality, novels, only, finds, the, didactic, among, the, works, of, charlotte, while, she, appreciates, the, happy, blend, of, romance, and, realism, in, the, works, of, emily, there, is, however, nothing, that, could, constitute, a, literary, vein, by, 1860, charlotte, had, been, dead, for, five, years, and, the, only, people, living, at, the, parsonage, were, mr, bront, his, son, in, law, arthur, bell, nicholls, and, two, servants, in, 1857, mrs, gaskell, s, biography, of, charlotte, was, published, and, though, at, its, first, reading, mr, bront, approved, of, its, commissioning, several, months, later, he, expressed, doubts, the, portrait, of, nicholls, founded, partly, on, the, confidence, of, ellen, nussey, seemed, to, him, to, be, unjustified, ellen, nussey, who, hated, arthur, insists, that, his, marital, claims, had, perverted, charlotte, s, writing, and, she, had, to, struggle, against, an, interruption, of, her, career, it, is, true, that, arthur, found, nussey, to, be, too, close, to, his, wife, and, he, insisted, that, she, should, destroy, her, letters, although, this, never, actually, happened, mrs, gaskell, s, book, caused, a, sensation, and, was, distributed, nationwide, the, polemic, launched, by, charlotte, s, father, resulted, in, a, squabble, that, only, served, to, increase, the, family, s, fame, during, charlotte, s, lifetime, friends, and, sponsors, visited, the, parsonage, including, sir, james, and, lady, kay, shuttleworth, ellen, nussey, elizabeth, gaskell, john, store, smith, a, young, writer, from, manchester, bessie, parkes, who, recounted, her, visit, to, mrs, gaskell, and, abraham, holroyd, poet, antiquarian, and, historian, however, following, the, publication, of, the, book, and, the, pastor, s, public, remonstrations, the, parsonage, became, a, place, of, pilgrimage, for, admirers, wanting, to, see, it, with, their, own, eyes, charlotte, s, husband, recalled, that, he, had, to, protect, his, father, in, law, when, on, the, short, path, to, the, church, they, had, to, push, their, way, through, the, crowds, of, people, wanting, to, reach, out, and, touch, the, cape, of, the, father, of, the, bront, girls, the, hundreds, of, visitors, became, thousands, coming, from, all, over, britain, and, even, from, across, the, atlantic, whenever, he, agreed, to, meet, them, patrick, received, them, with, utmost, courtesy, and, recounted, the, story, of, his, brilliant, daughters, never, omitting, to, express, his, displeasure, at, the, opinions, held, about, charlotte, s, husband, the, flow, of, visitors, has, never, abated, indeed, the, parsonage, at, haworth, received, an, estimated, 88, 000, visitors, in, 2017, the, bront, parsonage, museum, is, managed, and, maintained, by, the, bront, society, which, organises, exhibitions, and, takes, care, of, the, cultural,
