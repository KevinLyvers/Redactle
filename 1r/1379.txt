promoted, as, the, official, language, and, the, establishment, of, communications, facilities, including, radio, was, used, to, encourage, a, sense, of, chinese, nationalism, in, a, way, that, had, not, been, possible, when, the, nation, lacked, an, effective, central, government, under, that, context, the, chinese, rural, reconstruction, movement, was, implemented, by, some, social, activists, who, graduated, as, professors, of, the, united, states, with, tangible, but, limited, progress, in, modernizing, the, tax, infrastructural, economic, cultural, and, educational, equipment, and, the, mechanisms, of, rural, regions, the, social, activists, actively, co, ordinated, with, the, local, governments, in, the, towns, and, villages, since, the, early, 1930s, however, the, policy, was, subsequently, neglected, and, canceled, by, chiang, s, government, because, of, rampant, wars, and, the, lack, of, resources, after, the, japanese, war, and, the, civil, war, despite, being, a, conservative, chiang, supported, modernization, policies, such, as, scientific, advancement, universal, education, and, women, s, rights, the, kuomintang, supported, women, s, suffrage, and,

across, china, and, also, promoted, the, ideals, of, tridemism, of, democracy, republicanism, science, constitutionalism, and, chinese, nationalism, based, on, the, dang, guo, of, the, kmt, any, successes, that, the, nationalists, achieved, however, were, met, with, constant, political, and, military, upheavals, many, of, the, urban, areas, were, now, under, the, control, of, the, kmt, but, much, of, the, countryside, remained, under, the, influence, of, weakened, but, undefeated, warlords, landlords, and, communists, chiang, often, resolved, issues, of, warlord, obstinacy, through, military, action, but, such, action, was, costly, in, terms, of, men, and, material, the, central, plains, war, alone, nearly, bankrupted, the, nationalist, government, and, caused, almost, 250, 000, casualties, on, both, sides, in, 1931, hu, hanmin, an, old, supporter, of, chiang, publicly, voiced, a, popular, concern, that, chiang, s, position, as, both, premier, and, president, flew, in, the, face, of, the, democratic, ideals, of, the, nationalist, government, chiang, had, hu, put, under, house, arrest, but, hu, was, released, after, national, condemnation, hu, then, left, nanjing, and, supported, a, rival, government, in, canton, the, split, resulted, in, a, military, conflict, between, hu, s, guangdong, government, and, chiang, s, nationalist, government, throughout, his, rule, complete, eradication, of, the, communists, remained, chiang, s, dream, after, he, had, assembled, his, forces, in, jiangxi, chiang, led, his, armies, against, the, newly, established, chinese, soviet, republic, with, help, from, foreign, military, advisers, such, as, max, bauer, and, alexander, von, falkenhausen, chiang, s, fifth, campaign, finally, surrounded, the, chinese, red, army, in, 1934, the, communists, tipped, off, that, a, nationalist, offensive, was, imminent, retreated, in, the, long, march, during, which, mao, rose, from, a, mere, military, official, to, the, most, influential, leader, of, the, chinese, communist, party, some, academics, and, historians, have, classified, chiang, s, rule, as, fascist, the, new, life, movement, initiated, by, chiang, was, based, upon, confucianism, mixed, with, christianity, nationalism, and, authoritarianism, that, have, some, similarities, to, fascism, frederic, wakeman, argued, that, the, new, life, movement, was, confucian, fascism, chiang, also, sponsored, the, creation, of, the, blue, shirts, society, in, conscious, imitation, of, the, blackshirts, in, the, italian, fascist, party, and, the, sturmabteilung, of, the, nazi, party, its, ideology, was, to, expel, foreign, japanese, and, western, imperialists, from, china, and, to, crush, communism, close, ties, with, nazi, germany, also, gave, the, nationalist, government, access, to, german, military, and, economic, assistance, during, the, mid, 1930s, 64, in, a, 1935, speech, chiang, stated, that, fascism, is, what, china, now, most, needs, and, described, fascism, as, the, stimulant, for, a, declining, society, 64, mao, once, derogatorily, compared, chiang, to, adolf, hitler, referring, to, him, as, the, f, hrer, of, china, sino, german, relations, rapidly, deteriorated, as, germany, grew, closer, to, japan, and, almost, completely, broke, down, when, japan, launched, a, full, scale, invasion, of, china, in, 1937, which, germany, failed, to, mediate, however, china, did, not, declare, war, on, germany, italy, or, even, japan, until, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, december, 1941, chinese, communists, and, many, conservative, anti, communist, writers, have, argued, that, chiang, was, pro, capitalist, based, on, the, alliance, thesis, the, alliance, between, chiang, and, the, capitalists, to, purge, the, communist, and, the, leftist, elements, in, shanghai, as, well, as, in, the, resulting, civil, war, however, chiang, also, antagonized, the, capitalists, of, shanghai, by, often, attacking, them, and, confiscating, their, capital, and, assets, for, government, use, even, while, he, denounced, and, fought, against, communists, critics, have, called, that, bureaucratic, capitalism, historian, parks, m, coble, argues, that, the, phrase, bureaucratic, capitalism, is, too, simplistic, to, adequately, characterize, this, phenomenon, instead, he, says, the, regime, weakened, all, social, forces, so, that, the, government, could, pursue, policies, without, being, responsible, nor, responsive, to, any, outside, political, groups, by, defeating, any, potential, challenge, to, its, power, government, officials, could, amass, sizable, fortunes, with, that, motive, chiang, cracked, down, pro, communist, worker, and, peasant, organizations, as, well, as, rich, shanghai, capitalists, chiang, also, continued, the, anti, capitalist, rhetoric, of, sun, yat, sen, and, directed, the, kuomintang, media, to, attack, the, capitalists, and, capitalism, openly, he, supported, government, controlled, industries, instead, coble, says, that, the, rhetoric, had, no, impact, on, governmental, policy, and, that, its, use, was, to, prevent, the, capitalists, from, claiming, legitimacy, within, the, party, or, society, and, to, control, them, and, their, wealth, authority, within, the, nationalist, government, ultimately, lay, with, chiang, 43, all, major, policy, changes, on, military, diplomatic, or, economic, issues, required, his, approval, 156, according, to, historian, odd, arne, westad, no, other, leader, within, the, had, the, authority, to, force, through, even, the, simplest, decisions, 156, the, practical, power, of, high, ranking, officials, like, ministers, or, the, head, of, the, executive, yuan, was, more, closely, tied, to, their, relationship, with, chiang, than, with, the, formal, authority, of, their, position, 43, chiang, created, multiple, layers, of, power, in, his, administration, which, he, sometimes, played, off, against, each, other, to, prevent, individuals, or, cliques, from, gathering, power, that, could, oppose, his, authority, 93, 94, contrary, to, the, critique, that, chiang, was, highly, corrupt, he, was, not, involved, in, corruption, himself, however, his, wife, soong, mei, ling, ignored, her, family, s, involvement, in, corruption, the, soong, family, embezzled, 20, million, in, the, course, of, the, 1930s, and, the, 1940s, when, the, nationalist, government, s, revenues, were, less, than, 30, million, per, year, 40, the, soong, family, s, eldest, son, t, v, soong, was, the, chinese, premier, and, finance, minister, and, the, eldest, daughter, soong, ai, ling, was, the, wife, of, kung, hsiang, hsi, the, wealthiest, man, in, china, the, second, daughter, soong, ching, ling, was, the, wife, of, sun, yat, sen, china, s, founding, father, the, youngest, daughter, soong, mei, ling, married, chiang, in, 1927, and, following, the, marriage, both, families, became, intimately, connected, which, created, the, soong, dynasty, and, the, four, families, however, soong, was, also, credited, for, her, campaign, for, women, s, rights, in, china, including, her, attempts, to, improve, the, education, culture, and, social, benefits, of, chinese, women, critics, have, said, that, the, four, families, monopolized, the, regime, and, looted, it, the, us, sent, considerable, aid, to, the, nationalist, government, but, soon, realized, the, widespread, corruption, military, supplies, that, were, sent, appeared, on, the, black, market, significant, sums, of, money, that, had, been, transmitted, through, t, v, soong, china, s, finance, minister, soon, disappeared, president, truman, famously, referred, to, the, nationalist, leaders, they, re, thieves, every, damn, one, of, them, he, also, said, they, stole, 750, million, out, of, the, billions, that, we, sent, to, chiang, they, stole, it, and, it, s, invested, in, real, estate, down, in, s, o, paolo, and, some, right, here, in, new, york, soong, mei, ling, and, soong, ai, ling, lived, luxurious, lifestyles, and, held, millions, in, property, clothes, art, and, jewelry, soong, ai, ling, and, soong, mei, ling, were, also, the, two, richest, women, in, china, despite, living, a, luxurious, life, for, almost, her, entire, life, soong, mei, ling, left, only, a, 120, 000, inheritance, and, the, reason, is, that, according, to, her, niece, that, she, donated, most, of, her, wealth, when, she, was, still, alive, chiang, requiring, support, tolerated, corruption, with, people, in, his, inner, circles, as, well, as, high, ranking, nationalist, officials, but, not, of, lower, ranking, officers, in, 1934, he, ordered, seven, military, officers, who, embezzled, state, property, to, be, shot, in, another, case, several, division, commanders, pleaded, with, chiang, to, pardon, a, criminal, officer, but, as, soon, as, the, division, commanders, had, left, chiang, ordered, him, shot, the, deputy, editor, and, chief, reporter, at, the, central, daily, news, lu, keng, made, headline, international, news, by, exposing, the, corruption, of, two, senior, officials, kong, xiangxi, h, h, kung, and, t, v, soong, chiang, then, ordered, a, thorough, investigation, of, the, central, daily, news, to, find, the, source, however, lu, risked, execution, by, refusing, to, comply, and, protecting, his, journalists, chiang, wanting, to, avoid, an, international, response, and, so, jailed, lu, instead, chiang, realized, the, widespread, problems, that, corruption, was, creating, and, so, he, undertook, several, anti, corruption, campaigns, before, and, after, world, war, ii, with, varying, success, before, the, war, both, campaigns, the, nanjing, decade, cleanup, of, 1927, 1930, and, the, wartime, reform, movement, of, 1944, 1947, failed, after, the, world, war, ii, and, the, civil, war, both, campaigns, the, kuomintang, reconstruction, of, 1950, 1952, and, the, governmental, rejuvenation, of, 1969, 1973, succeeded, chiang, who, viewed, all, of, the, foreign, great, powers, with, suspicion, wrote, in, a, letter, that, they, all, have, it, in, their, minds, to, promote, the, interests, of, their, own, respective, countries, at, the, cost, of, other, nations, and, saw, it, as, hypocritical, for, any, of, them, to, condemn, one, another, s, foreign, policy, he, used, diplomatic, persuasion, on, the, united, states, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, to, regain, lost, chinese, territories, as, he, viewed, all, foreign, powers, as, imperialists, that, were, attempting, to, exploit, china, during, april, 1931, chiang, kai, shek, attended, a, national, leadership, conference, in, nanjing, with, zhang, xueliang, and, general, ma, fuxiang, during, which, chiang, and, zhang, dauntlessly, upheld,

government, he, returned, shortly, afterward, and, adopted, the, slogan, first, internal, pacification, then, external, resistance, however, his, policy, of, avoiding, a, frontal, war, against, japan, and, prioritizing, anti, communist, suppression, was, widely, unpopular, and, provoked, nationwide, protests, in, 1932, while, chiang, was, seeking, first, to, defeat, the, communists, japan, launched, an, advance, on, shanghai, and, bombarded, nanjing, that, disrupted, chiang, s, offensives, against, the, communists, for, a, time, but, it, was, the, northern, factions, of, hu, hanmin, s,

general, joseph, stilwell, an, american, military, advisor, to, chiang, during, world, war, ii, strongly, criticized, chiang, and, his, generals, for, what, stilwell, saw, as, their, incompetence, and, corruption, in, 1944, the, united, states, army, air, corps, commenced, operation, matterhorn, to, bomb, japan, s, steel, industry, from, bases, to, be, constructed, in, mainland, china, that, was, meant, to, fulfill, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, promise, to, chiang, to, begin, bombing, operations, against, japan, by, november, 1944, however, chiang, s, subordinates, refused, to, take, air, base, construction, seriously, until, enough, capital, had, been, delivered, to, permit, embezzlement, on, a, massive, scale, stilwell, estimated, that, at, least, half, of, the, 100, million, spent, on, construction, of, air, bases, was, embezzled, by, nationalist, party, officials, the, poor, performance, of, nationalist, forces, during, the, japanese, ichigo, campaign, contributed, to, the, view, that, chiang, was, incompetent, 3, their, poor, performance, irreparably, damaged, chiang, and, the, nationalists, in, the, view, of, the, roosevelt, administration, 75, chiang, argued, that, the, united, states, and, stillwell, in, particular, were, at, fault, for, the, failure, because, they, had, moved, too, many, chinese, troops, into, the, burma, campaign, 3, after, the, japanese, surrender, chiang, had, to, rely, on, the, assistance, of, the, united, states, in, order, to, transport, his, troops, to, regain, control, of, occupied, areas, 3, non, chinese, found, the, behavior, of, these, troops, and, accompanying, officials, as, undercutting, nationalist, legitimacy, as, nationalist, forces, engaged, in, a, botched, liberation, characterized, by, corruption, looting, and, inefficiency, 3, chiang, tried, to, balance, the, influence, of, the, soviets, and, the, americans, in, china, during, the, war, he, first, told, the, americans, that, they, would, be, welcome, in, talks, between, the, soviet, union, and, china, and, then, secretly, told, the, soviets, that, the, americans, were, unimportant, and, that, their, opinions, would, not, be, considered, chiang, also, used, american, support, and, military, power, in, china, against, soviet, ambitions, to, dominate, the, talks, that, stopped, the, soviets, from, taking, full, advantage, of, the, situation, in, china, by, the, threat, of, american, military, action, against, them, chiang, s, nationalist, government, made, laws, on, abortion, in, china, more, restrictive, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, in, 1945, chiang, adopted, a, eugenic, population, policy, that, was, intended, to, promote, hybrid, vigor, by, encouraging, intermarriage, between, whites, and, chinese, to, combine, european, fair, skin, with, superior, chinese, intelligence, although, adopted, the, policy, was, never, successfully, implemented, president, roosevelt, through, general, stilwell, privately, made, it, clear, that, he, preferred, for, the, french, not, to, reacquire, french, indochina, now, vietnam, cambodia, and, laos, after, the, war, was, over, roosevelt, offered, chiang, control, of, all, of, indochina, it, was, said, that, chiang, replied, in, english, under, no, circumstances, after, the, war, 200, 000, chinese, troops, under, general, lu, han, were, sent, by, chiang, to, northern, indochina, north, of, the, 16th, parallel, to, accept, the, surrender, of, japanese, occupying, forces, there, and, the, chinese, forces, remained, in, indochina, until, 1946, when, the, french, returned, the, chinese, used, the, vnqdd, the, vietnamese, branch, of, the, kuomintang, to, increase, their, influence, in, indochina, and, to, put, pressure, on, their, opponents, chiang, threatened, the, french, with, war, in, response, to, maneuvering, by, the, french, and, ho, chi, minh, s, forces, against, each, other, and, forced, them, to, come, to, a, peace, agreement, in, february, 1946, he, also, forced, the, french, to, surrender, all, of, their, concessions, in, china, and, to, renounce, their, extraterritorial, privileges, in, exchange, for, the, chinese, withdrawing, from, northern, indochina, and, allowing, french, troops, to, reoccupy, the, region, after, france, s, agreement, to, those, demands, 20, 000, french, soldiers, landed, in, haiphong, north, vietnam, on, march, 6, 1946, under, the, leadership, of, general, philippe, leclerc, de, hauteclocque, followed, by, the, withdrawal, of, chinese, troops, which, began, in, march, 1946, according, to, republic, of, china, s, notes, of, a, dinner, meeting, during, the, cairo, conference, in, 1943, roosevelt, asked, chiang, whether, china, desired, the, ryukyu, islands, as, territories, restored, from, japan, chiang, said, he, would, be, agreeable, to, joint, occupation, and, administration, by, china, and, the, united, states, because, of, chiang, s, focus, on, his, communist, opponents, he, allowed, some, japanese, forces, and, forces, from, the, japanese, puppet, regimes, to, remain, on, duty, in, occupied, areas, in, an, effort, to, prevent, the, communists, from, accepting, their, surrender, 3, american, troops, and, weapons, soon, bolstered, the, nationalist, forces, which, allowed, them, to, reclaim, the, cities, the, countryside, however, remained, largely, under, communist, control, chiang, implemented, his, war, time, phrase, repay, evil, with, good, and, made, a, huge, effort, to, protect, elements, of, the, japanese, invading, army, in, 1949, a, nationalist, court, acquitted, general, okamura, yasuji, the, chief, commander, of, japanese, forces, in, china, of, alleged, war, crimes, retaining, him, as, an, advisor, nationalist, china, repeatedly, intervened, to, protect, okamura, from, repeated, american, requests, to, testify, at, the, tokyo, war, crimes, trial, many, top, nationalist, generals, including, chiang, had, studied, and, trained, in, japan, before, the, nationalists, had, returned, to, the, mainland, in, the, 1920s, and, maintained, close, personal, friendships, with, top, japanese, officers, the, japanese, general, in, charge, of, all, forces, in, china, general, okamura, had, personally, trained, officers, who, later, became, generals, in, chiang, s, staff, reportedly, chiang, seriously, considered, accepting, this, offer, but, declined, only, because, he, knew, that, the, united, states, would, certainly, be, outraged, by, the, gesture, even, so, armed, japanese, troops, remained, in, china, well, into, 1947, with, some, non, commissioned, officers, finding, their, way, into, the, nationalist, officer, corps, the, japanese, in, china, came, to, regard, chiang, as, a, magnanimous, figure, to, whom, many, of, them, owed, their, lives, and, livelihoods, that, fact, was, attested, by, both, nationalist, and, communist, sources, chiang, did, not, de, mobilize, his, troops, after, the, defeat, of, the, japanese, instead, remaining, on, a, war, footing, to, prepare, for, the, resumption, of, civil, war, against, the, communists, 85, this, further, strained, the, economy, of, nationalist, era, china, worsening, deficits, 84, 85, a, significant, body, of, evidence, suggests, that, much, of, the, nationalist, military, budget, in, this, period, was, wasted, 86, one, factor, in, military, budget, waste, included, that, troop, counts, were, inflated, above, actual, head, counts, and, that, officers, embezzled, the, salaries, of, the, non, existent, soldiers, 86, another, was, the, power, of, military, commanders, over, local, branches, of, the, bank, of, china, which, they, could, require, to, provide, currency, outside, of, the, normal, budget, process, 86, 87, although, chiang, had, achieved, status, abroad, as, a, world, leader, his, government, deteriorated, as, the, result, of, corruption, and, hyperinflation, in, his, diary, in, june, 1948, chiang, wrote, that, the, kmt, had, failed, not, because, of, external, enemies, but, because, of, rot, from, within, the, war, had, severely, weakened, the, nationalists, and, the, communists, were, strengthened, by, their, popular, land, reform, policies, and, by, a, rural, population, that, supported, and, trusted, them, the, nationalists, initially, had, superiority, in, arms, and, men, but, their, lack, of, popularity, infiltration, by, communist, agents, low, morale, and, disorganization, soon, allowed, the, communists, to, gain, the, upper, hand, in, the, civil, war, after, world, war, ii, the, united, states, encouraged, peace, talks, between, chiang, and, the, communist, leader, mao, zedong, in, chongqing, concerns, about, widespread, and, well, documented, corruption, in, chiang, s, government, throughout, his, rule, made, the, us, government, limit, aid, to, chiang, for, much, of, the, period, of, 1946, to, 1948, despite, the, fighting, against, mao, s, red, army, alleged, infiltration, of, the, us, government, by, ccp, agents, may, have, also, played, a, role, in, the, suspension, of, american, aid, chiang, s, right, hand, man, the, secret, police, chief, dai, li, was, anti, american, and, anti, communist, and, a, self, declared, fascist, dai, ordered, kuomintang, agents, to, spy, on, american, officers, earlier, dai, had, been, involved, with, the, blue, shirts, society, a, fascist, inspired, paramilitary, group, within, the, kuomintang, that, wanted, to, expel, western, and, japanese, imperialists, crush, the, communists, and, eliminate, feudalism, dai, li, died, in, a, plane, crash, which, some, suspect, to, be, an, assassination, orchestrated, by, chiang, however, the, assassination, was, also, rumoured, to, have, been, arranged, by, the, american, office, of, strategic, services, because, of, dai, s, anti, americanism, and, since, it, happened, on, an, american, plane, a, new, constitution, was, promulgated, in, 1947, and, chiang, was, elected, by, the, national, assembly, as, the, first, president, of, the, republic, of, china, on, 20, may, 1948, that, marked, the, beginning, of, what, was, termed, the, democratic, constitutional, government, period, by, the, kmt, political, orthodoxy, but, the, communists, refused, to, recognize, the, new, constitution, and, its, government, as, legitimate, chiang, resigned, as, president, on, 21, january, 1949, as, nationalist, forces, suffered, terrible, losses, and, defections, to, the, communists, after, chiang, s, resignation, vice, president, li, zongren, became, china, s, acting, president, shortly, after, chiang, s, resignation, the, communists, halted, their, advances, and, attempted, to, negotiate, the, nationalists, virtual, surrender, li, tried, to, negotiate, milder, terms, to, end, the, civil, war, but, had, no, success, when, it, became, clear, that, li, was, unlikely, to, accept, mao, s, terms, the, communists, issued, an, ultimatum, in, april, 1949, that, warned, that, they, would, resume, their, attacks, if, li, did, not, agree, within, five, days, li, refused, li, s, attempts, to, carry, out, his, policies, faced, varying, degrees, of, opposition, from, chiang, s, supporters, and, were, generally, unsuccessful, taylor, has, noted, that, chiang, had, a, superstitious, belief, in, holding, manchuria, after, the, nationalist, military, defeat, in, the, province, chiang, lost, faith, in, winning, the, war, and, started, to, prepare, for, the, retreat, to, taiwan, chiang, especially, antagonized, li, by, taking, possession, of, and, moving, to, taiwan, us, 200, million, of, gold, and, us, dollars, that, belonged, to, the, central, government, li, desperately, needed, them, to, cover, the, government, s, soaring, expenses, when, the, communists, captured, the, nationalist, capital, of, nanjing, in, april, 1949, li, refused, to, accompany, the, central, government, as, it, fled, to, guangdong, and, instead, expressed, his, dissatisfaction, with, chiang, by, retiring, to, guangxi, the, former, warlord, yan, xishan, who, had, fled, to, nanjing, only, one, month, earlier, quickly, insinuated, himself, within, the, li, chiang, rivalry, and, attempted, to, have, li, and, chiang, reconcile, their, differences, in, the, effort, to, resist, the, communists, at, chiang, s, request, yan, visited, li, to, convince, li, not, to, withdraw, from, public, life, yan, broke, down, in, tears, while, he, talked, of, the, loss, of, his, home, province, of, shanxi, to, the, communists, and, he, warned, li, that, the, nationalist, cause, was, doomed, unless, li, went, to, guangdong, li, agreed, to, return, if, chiang, surrendered, most, of, the, gold, and, us, dollars, in, his, possession, that, belonged, to, the, central, government, and, chiang, stopped, overriding, li, s, authority, after, yan, communicated, those, demands, and, chiang, agreed, to, comply, with, them, li, departed, for, guangdong, in, guangdong, li, attempted, to, create, a, new, government, composed, of, both, supporters, and, opponents, of, chiang, li, s, first, choice, of, premier, was, chu, cheng, a, veteran, member, of, the, kuomintang, who, had, been, virtually, driven, into, exile, for, his, strong, opposition, to, chiang, after, the, legislative, yuan, jas, rejected, chu, li, was, obliged, to, choose, yan, xishan, instead, by, then, yan, was, well, known, for, his, adaptability, and, chiang, welcomed, his, appointment, the, conflict, between, chiang, and, li, persisted, although, he, had, agreed, to, do, so, as, a, prerequisite, of, li, s, return, chiang, refused, to, surrender, more, than, a, fraction, of, the, wealth, that, he, had, sent, to, taiwan, without, being, backed, by, gold, or, foreign, currency, the, money, that, was, issued, by, li, and, yan, quickly, declined, in, value, until, it, became, virtually, worthless, although, he, did, not, hold, a, formal, executive, position, in, the, government, chiang, continued, to, issue, orders, to, the, army, and, many, officers, continued, to, obey, chiang, rather, than, li, the, inability, of, li, to, co, ordinate, kmt, military, forces, led, him, to, put, into, effect, a, plan, of, defense, that, he, had, contemplated, in, 1948, instead, of, attempting, to, defend, all, of, southern, china, li, ordered, what, remained, of, the, nationalist, armies, to, withdraw, to, guangxi, and, guangdong, he, hoped, that, he, could, concentrate, all, available, defenses, on, the, smaller, area, which, would, be, more, easily, defensible, the, object, of, li, s, strategy, was, to, maintain, a, foothold, on, the, chinese, mainland, in, the, hope, that, the, united, states, would, eventually, be, compelled, to, enter, the, war, in, china, on, the, nationalist, side, chiang, opposed, li, s, plan, of, defense, because, it, would, have, placed, most, of, the, troops, who, were, still, loyal, to, chiang, under, the, control, of, li, and, chiang, s, other, opponents, in, the, central, government, to, overcome, chiang, s, intransigence, li, began, ousting, chiang, s, supporters, within, the, central, government, yan, xishan, continued, in, his, attempts, to, work, with, both, sides, which, created, the, impression, among, li, s, supporters, that, he, was, a, stooge, of, chiang, and, those, who, supported, chiang, began, to, bitterly, resent, yan, for, his, willingness, to, work, with, li, because, of, the, rivalry, between, chiang, and, li, chiang, refused, to, allow, nationalist, troops, loyal, to, him, to, aid, in, the, defense, of, guangxi, and, canton, that, let, communist, forces, occupy, canton, in, october, 1949, after, canton, fell, to, the, communists, chiang, relocated, the, government, to, chongqing, and, li, effectively, surrendered, his, powers, and, flew, to, new, york, for, treatment, of, his, chronic, duodenum, illness, at, the, hospital, of, columbia, university, li, visited, president, truman, and, denounced, chiang, as, a, dictator, and, an, usurper, li, vowed, that, he, would, return, to, crush, chiang, once, he, returned, to, china, li, remained, in, exile, and, did, not, return, to, taiwan, in, the, early, morning, of, 10, december, 1949, communist, troops, laid, siege, to, chengdu, the, last, kmt, controlled, city, in, mainland, china, where, chiang, kai, shek, and, his, son, chiang, ching, kuo, directed, the, defense, at, the, chengtu, central, military, academy, flying, out, of, chengdu, fenghuangshan, airport, father, and, son, were, evacuated, to, taiwan, via, guangdong, on, the, aircraft, may, ling, and, arrived, the, same, day, chiang, kai, shek, would, never, return, to, the, mainland, historian, odd, arne, westad, says, the, communists, won, the, civil, war, because, they, made, fewer, military, mistakes, than, chiang, had, also, his, search, for, a, powerful, centralized, government, made, chiang, antagonize, too, many, interest, groups, in, china, furthermore, his, party, was, weakened, by, the, war, against, japan, meanwhile, the, communists, told, different, groups, such, as, peasants, exactly, what, they, wanted, to, hear, and, cloaked, themselves, in, the, cover, of, chinese, nationalism, chiang, did, not, reassume, the, presidency, until, 1, march, 1950, in, january, 1952, chiang, commanded, the, control, yuan, now, in, taiwan, to, impeach, li, in, the, case, of, li, zongren, s, failure, to, carry, out, duties, due, to, illegal, conduct, chiang, relieved, li, of, the, position, as, vice, president, of, the, national, assembly, in, march, 1954, chiang, moved, the, government, to, taipei, taiwan, where, he, resumed, his, duties, as, president, on, 1, march, 1950, chiang, was, re, elected, by, the, national, assembly, to, be, the, president, of, the, republic, of, china, on, 20, may, 1954, and, again, in, 1960, 1966, and, 1972, he, continued, to, claim, sovereignty, over, all, of, china, including, the, territories, held, by, his, government, and, the, people, s, republic, as, well, as, territory, the, latter, ceded, to, foreign, governments, such, as, tuva, and, outer, mongolia, in, the, context, of, the, cold, war, most, of, the, western, world, recognized, that, position, and, the, roc, represented, china, in, the, united, nations, and, other, international, organizations, until, the, 1970s, during, his, presidency, on, taiwan, chiang, continued, making, preparations, to, take, back, mainland, china, he, developed, the, jrotc, army, to, prepare, for, an, invasion, of, the, mainland, and, to, defend, taiwan, in, case, of, an, attack, by, the, communist, forces, he, also, financed, armed, groups, in, mainland, china, such, as, muslim, soldiers, of, the, roc, army, who, had, been, left, in, yunnan, under, li, mi, and, continued, to, fight, it, was, not, until, the, 1980s, that, those, troops, were, finally, airlifted, to, taiwan, he, promoted, the, uyghur, yulbars, khan, to, governor, during, the, islamic, insurgency, on, the, mainland, for, resisting, the, communists, even, though, the, government, had, already, evacuated, to, taiwan, he, planned, an, invasion, of, the, mainland, in, 1962, in, the, 1950s, chiang, s, airplanes, dropped, supplies, to, kuomintang, muslim, insurgents, in, qinghai, in, the, traditional, tibetan, area, of, amdo, despite, an, ostensibly, democratic, constitution, the, government, under, chiang, was, a, de, facto, one, party, state, consisting, almost, completely, of, mainlanders, the, temporary, provisions, effective, during, the, period, of, communist, rebellion, greatly, enhanced, the, executive, s, powers, and, the, goal, of, retaking, mainland, china, allowed, the, kmt, to, maintain, a, monopoly, on, power, and, to, prohibit, real, parliamentary, opposition, the, government, s, official, line, for, the, martial, law, provisions, stemmed, from, the, claim, that, emergency, provisions, were, necessary, since, the, communists, and, the, nationalists, were, still, in, a, state, of, war, seeking, to, promote, chinese, nationalism, chiang, s, government, actively, ignored, and, suppressed, local, cultural, expression, and, even, forbade, the, use, of, local, languages, in, mass, media, broadcasts, or, during, class, sessions, as, a, result, of, taiwan, s, anti, government, uprising, in, 1947, known, as, the, february, 28, incident, the, kmt, led, political, repression, resulted, in, the, death, or, the, disappearance, of, up, to, 30, 000, taiwanese, intellectuals, activists, and, people, suspected, of, opposition, to, the, kmt, the, first, decades, after, the, nationalists, had, moved, the, seat, of, government, to, the, province, of, taiwan, are, associated, with, the, organized, effort, to, resist, communism, which, was, known, as, the, white, terror, about, 140, 000, taiwanese, were, imprisoned, for, their, real, or, perceived, opposition, to, the, kuomintang, most, of, those, prosecuted, were, labeled, by, the, kuomintang, as, bandit, spies, meaning, spies, for, chinese, communists, and, punished, as, such, or, taiwanese, separatists, under, the, pretext, that, new, elections, could, not, be, held, in, communist, occupied, constituencies, the, national, assembly, legislative, yuan, and, control, yuan, members, held, their, posts, indefinitely, the, temporary, provisions, also, allowed, chiang, to, remain, as, president, beyond, the, two, term, limit, in, the, constitution, he, was, re, elected, by, the, national, assembly, as, president, four, times, in, 1954, 1960, 1966, and, 1972, believing, that, corruption, and, the, lack, of, morals, were, key, reasons, that, the, kmt, had, lost, mainland, china, to, the, communists, chiang, attempted, to, purge, corruption, by, dismissing, members, of, the, kmt, who, were, accused, of, graft, some, major, figures, in, the, previous, mainland, chinese, government, such, as, chiang, s, brothers, in, law, h, h, kung, and, t, v, soong, exiled, themselves, to, the, united, states, although, politically, authoritarian, and, to, some, extent, dominated, by, government, owned, industries, chiang, s, new, taiwanese, state, also, encouraged, economic, development, especially, in, the, export, sector, a, popular, sweeping, land, reform, act, as, well, as, american, foreign, aid, during, the, 1950s, laid, the, foundation, for, taiwan, s, economic, success, to, become, one, of, the, four, asian, tigers, after, retreating, to, taiwan, chiang, learned, from, his, mistakes, and, failures, in, the, mainland, and, blamed, them, for, failing, to, pursue, sun, yat, sen, s, ideals, of, tridemism, and, welfarism, chiang, s, land, reform, more, than, doubled, the, land, ownership, of, taiwanese, farmers, it, removed, the, rent, burdens, on, them, with, former, landowners, using, the, government, compensation, to, become, the, new, capitalist, class, he, promoted, a, mixed, economy, of, state, and, private, ownership, with, economic, planning, chiang, also, promoted, a, nine, year, free, education, and, the, importance, of, science, in, taiwanese, education, and, values, those, measures, generated, great, success, with, consistent, and, strong, growth, and, the, stabilization, of, inflation, after, the, government, of, the, republic, of, china, had, moved, to, taiwan, chiang, kai, shek, s, economic, policy, turned, towards, to, economic, liberalism, and, used, sho, chieh, tsiang, and, other, liberal, economists, to, promote, economic, liberalization, reforms, in, taiwan, however, taylor, has, noted, that, the, developmental, model, of, chiangism, in, taiwan, still, had, elements, of, socialism, and, the, gini, index, of, taiwan, was, around, 0, 28, by, the, 1970s, which, was, lower, than, the, relatively, egalitarian, west, germany, roc, taiwan, was, one, of, the, most, equal, countries, in, the, pro, western, bloc, those, in, the, lower, 40, of, income, doubled, their, share, to, 22, of, the, total, income, with, the, upper, 20, shrinking, their, share, from, 61, to, 39, from, the, time, of, japanese, rule, the, chiangist, economic, model, can, be, seen, as, a, form, of, dirigisme, with, the, state, playing, a, crucial, role, in, directing, the, market, economy, small, businesses, and, state, owned, enterprises, in, taiwan, flourished, under, the, economic, model, but, the, economy, did, not, see, the, emergence, of, corporate, monopolies, unlike, in, most, other, major, capitalist, countries, after, the, democratization, of, taiwan, it, began, to, slowly, drift, away, from, the, chiangist, economic, policy, to, embrace, a, more, free, market, system, as, part, of, the, economic, globalization, process, under, the, context, of, neoliberalism, chiang, had, the, personal, power, to, review, the, rulings, of, all, military, tribunals, which, during, the, martial, law, period, tried, civilians, as, well, in, 1950, lin, pang, chun, and, two, other, men, were, arrested, on, charges, of, financial, crimes, and, sentenced, to, 3, 10, years, in, prison, chiang, reviewed, the, sentences, of, all, three, and, ordered, them, executed, instead, in, 1954, the, changhua, monk,

that, japan, was, hesitant, to, withdraw, recognition, from, the, nationalist, government, was, the, presence, of, a, treaty, between, the, japanese, government, and, that, of, chiang, kai, shek, sato, explained, that, the, continued, recognition, of, japan, towards, the, nationalist, government, was, largely, because, of, the, personal, relationship, that, various, members, of, the, japanese, government, felt, towards, chiang, this, relationship, was, rooted, largely, in, the, generous, and, lenient, treatment, of, japanese, prisoners, of, war, by, the, nationalist, government, in, the, years, immediately, after, the, japanese, surrender, in, 1945, and, was, felt, especially, strongly, as, a, bond, of, personal, obligation, by, the, most, senior, members, who, were, in, power, although, japan, recognized, the, people, s, republic, in, 1972, shortly, after, kakuei, tanaka, had, succeeded, sato, as, prime, minister, of, japan, the, memory, of, the, relationship, was, strong, enough, to, be, reported, by, the, new, york, times, 15, april, 1978, as, a, significant, factor, inhibiting, trade, between, japan, and, the, mainland, there, is, speculation, that, a, clash, between, communist, forces, and, a, japanese, warship, in, 1978, was, caused, by, chinese, anger, by, japanese, prime, minister, takeo, fukuda, attending, chiang, s, funeral, historically, japan, s,

promulgated, the, view, that, the, souls, of, party, martyrs, who, died, fighting, for, the, kuomintang, the, revolution, and, the, party, founder, sun, yat, sen, were, sent, to, heaven, chiang, kai, shek, believed, that, these, martyrs, witnessed, events, on, earth, from, heaven, after, their, deaths, unlike, sun, s, original, tridemist, ideology, that, was, heavily, influenced, by, western, enlightenment, theorists, such, as, henry, george, abraham, lincoln, bertrand, russell, and, john, stuart, mill, the, traditional, chinese, confucian, influence, on, chiang, s, ideology, is, much, stronger, chiang, rejected, the, western, progressive, ideologies, of, individualism, liberalism, and, the, cultural, aspects, of, marxism, therefore, chiang, is, generally, more, culturally, and, socially, conservative, than, sun, yat, sen, jay, taylor, has, described, chiang, kai, shek, as, a, revolutionary, nationalist, and, a, left, leaning, confucian, jacobinist, when, the, northern, expedition, was, complete, kuomintang, generals, led, by, chiang, kai, shek, paid, tribute, to, sun, s, soul, in, heaven, with, a, sacrificial, ceremony, at, the, xiangshan, temple, in, beijing, in, july, 1928, among, the, kuomintang, generals, present, were, the, muslim, generals, bai, chongxi, and, ma, fuxiang, chiang, kai, shek, considered, both, han, chinese, and, all, ethnic, minorities, of, china, the, five, races, under, one, union, as, descendants, of, the, yellow, emperor, the, mythical, founder, of, the, chinese, nation, and, belonging, to, the, chinese, nation, zhonghua, minzu, he, introduced, this, into, kuomintang, ideology, which, was, propagated, into, the, educational, system, of, the, republic, of, china, chiang, as, a, chinese, nationalist, and, a, confucian, was, against, the, iconoclasm, of, the, may, fourth, movement, motivated, by, his, sense, of, nationalism, he, viewed, some, western, ideas, as, foreign, and, believed, that, the, great, introduction, of, western, ideas, and, literature, which, the, may, fourth, movement, promoted, was, not, beneficial, to, china, he, and, sun, criticized, the, may, fourth, intellectuals, as, corrupting, the, morals, of, china, s, youth, chiang, kai, shek, once, said, if, when, i, die, i, am, still, a, dictator, i, will, certainly, go, down, into, the, oblivion, of, all, dictators, if, on, the, other, hand, i, succeed, in, establishing, a, truly, stable, foundation, for, a, democratic, government, i, will, live, forever, in, every, home, in, china, chiang, s, legacy, has, been, subjected, to, heated, debates, for, some, chiang, was, a, national, hero, who, led, the, victorious, northern, expedition, against, the, beiyang, warlords, in, 1927, and, helped, achieve, chinese, unification, his, initial, image, as, the, leader, of, china, against, japan, s, invasion, both, before, and, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, led, him, to, be, featured, on, the, cover, of, time, magazine, ten, times, even, though, china, received, little, american, aid, compared, to, britain, and, the, soviet, union, it, did, not, fold, as, chiang, called, on, his, countrymen, to, fight, to, the, bitter, end, until, their, ultimate, victory, against, japan, in, 1945, some, also, see, him, as, a, champion, of, anti, communism, being, a, key, figure, during, the, formative, years, of, the, world, anti, communist, league, during, the, subsequent, cold, war, he, was, seen, as, the, leader, who, led, free, china, and, the, bulwark, against, a, possible, communist, invasion, however, historian, rudolph, rummel, documented, that, the, nationalist, government, under, chiang, led, to, millions, of, excess, deaths, from, calamities, such, as, its, persecution, against, actual, or, perceived, communists, and, its, conscription, of, soldiers, confiscation, of, food, and, flooding, of, downstream, regions, of, the, yellow, river, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, his, government, was, also, accused, of, being, corrupt, and, allying, with, known, criminals, such, as, du, yuesheng, for, political, and, financial, gains, and, his, critics, often, accuse, him, of, fascism, in, taiwan, he, ruled, throughout, a, period, of, martial, law, some, opponents, charge, that, chiang, s, efforts, in, developing, the, island, were, mostly, to, turn, it, into, a, strong, base, from, which, to, recover, mainland, china, and, that, he, had, little, regard, for, the, taiwanese, people, unlike, chiang, s, son, chiang, ching, kuo, who, is, respected, across, the, political, spectrum, chiang, kai, shek, s, image, is, perceived, rather, negatively, in, taiwan, he, was, rated, the, lowest, in, two, opinion, polls, about, the, perception, of, former, presidents, his, popularity, in, taiwan, is, divided, along, political, lines, enjoying, better, support, in, the, kuomintang, kmt, while, being, widely, unpopular, among, democratic, progressive, party, dpp, voters, and, those, who, blame, him, for, the, thousands, killed, during, the, february, 28, incident, and, criticise, his, dictatorial, rule, in, contrast, his, image, has, partially, improved, in, mainland, china, he, had, been, portrayed, as, a, villain, and, a, bourgeoisie, reactionary, lackey, who, fought, against, the, liberation, of, china, by, the, communists, but, since, the, 2000s, the, media, and, popular, culture, have, depicted, him, in, a, less, negative, manner, for, example, many, praised, the, 2009, movie, sponsored, by, the, chinese, communist, party, the, founding, of, a, republic, for, moving, away, from, casting, chiang, as, evil, versus, mao, and, emphasizing, instead, that, the, contingencies, of, war, led, the, communists, to, victory, in, the, context, of, the, second, sino, japanese, war, aspects, of, chiang, s, trip, to, india, or, meeting, with, roosevelt, and, churchill, in, cairo, can, be, viewed, positively, 4, the, shift, also, takes, into, account, chiang, s, commitment, to, a, unified, china, and, his, stance, against, taiwanese, separatism, chiang, s, ancestral, home, in, fenghua, zhejiang, has, become, a, museum, and, tourist, attraction, historian, rana, mitter, notes, that, the, displays, inside, were, very, positive, about, chiang, s, role, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, mitter, further, observed, that, ironically, today, s, china, is, closer, to, chiang, s, vision, than, to, mao, s, and, wrote, one, can, imagine, chiang, kai, shek, s, ghost, wandering, round, china, today, nodding, in, approval, while, mao, s, ghost, follows, behind, him, moaning, at, the, destruction, of, his, vision, liang, shuming, opined, that, chiang, kai, shek, s, greatest, contribution, was, to, make, the, ccp, successful, if, he, had, been, a, bit, more, trustworthy, if, his, character, was, somewhat, better, the, ccp, would, have, been, unable, to, beat, him, some, chinese, historians, argue, that, the, main, determinants, for, chiang, s, defeat, were, not, corruption, or, the, lack, of, us, support, but, his, decision, to, start, the, civil, war, with, 70, of, government, expenditures, in, the, military, his, overestimation, of, the, nationalist, forces, equipped, with, us, arms, and, the, loss, of, popularity, and, morales, of, his, soldiers, other, historians, argue, that, his, failure, was, largely, caused, by, external, factors, outside, of, chiang, s, control, they, include, the, refusal, of, the, truman, administration, to, support, chiang, by, withdrawing, aid, the, foisting, of, an, arms, embargo, by, george, c, marshall, the, failed, pursuit, of, a, d, tente, between, the, nationalists, and, the, communists, the, american, push, for, a, coalition, government, with, the, ccp, and, the, ussr, s, consistent, aid, and, support, for, the, ccp, during, the, civil, war, in, the, united, states, and, europe, chiang, was, often, perceived, negatively, as, the, one, who, lost, china, to, the, communists, his, persistent, demands, for, united, states, support, and, funding, also, prompted, jokes, from, american, officials, that, chiang, s, name, was, actually, general, cash, my, check, 33, he, has, also, been, criticized, for, his, poor, military, skills, such, as, issuing, unrealistic, orders, and, persistently, attempting, to, fight, unwinnable, battles, leading, to, the, loss, of, his, best, troops, in, recent, years, chiang, s, image, has, been, somewhat, rehabilitated, and, he, has, been, increasingly, perceived, as, a, man, overwhelmed, by, the, events, in, china, having, to, fight, the, communists, japanese, and, provincial, warlords, simultaneously, while, trying, to, reconstruct, and, unify, the, country, his, sincere, albeit, often, unsuccessful, attempts, to, build, a, more, powerful, and, modern, nation, have, been, noted, by, scholars, such, as, jonathan, fenby, rana, mitter, and, biographer, jay, taylor, in, 1901, in, an, arranged, marriage, at, age, 14, chiang, was, married, to, mao, fumei, an, illiterate, villager, five, years, his, senior, while, married, to, mao, chiang, adopted, two, concubines, concubinage, was, still, a, common, practice, for, well, to, do,

shanghai, chiang, and, yao, adopted, a, son, wei, kuo, chen, adopted, a, daughter, in, 1924, named, yaoguang, who, later, adopted, her, mother, s, surname, chen, s, autobiography, refuted, the, idea, that, she, was, a, concubine, chen, claiming, that, by, the, time, she, married, chiang, he, had, already, divorced, yao, and, that, chen, was, therefore, his, wife, chiang, and, mao, had, a, son, ching, kuo, according, to, the, memoirs, of, chen, jieru, chiang, s, second, wife, she, contracted, gonorrhea, from, chiang, soon, after, their, marriage, he, told, her, that, he, acquired, this, disease, after, separating, from, his, first, wife, and, living, with, his, concubine, yao, yecheng, as, well, as, with, many, other, women, he, consorted, with, his, doctor, explained, to, her, that, chiang, had, sex, with, her, before, completing, his, treatment, for, the, disease, as, a, result, both, chiang, and, chen, jieru, believed, that, they, had, become, sterile, however, a, purported, miscarriage, by, soong, mei, ling, in, august, 1928, would, if, it, actually, occurred, cast, serious, doubt, on, whether, this, was, true, the, xikou, chiangs, were, descended, from, chiang, shih, chieh, who, during, the, 1600s, moved, there, from, fenghua, district, and, whose, ancestors, in, turn, came, to, southeastern, china, s, zhejiang, chekiang, province, after, moving, out, of,

was, previously, believed, that, this, was, a, political, move, but, further, studies, of, his, personal, diaries, suggest, that, his, faith, was, sincere, chiang, developed, relationships, with, other, generals, chiang, became, a, sworn, brother, of, the, chinese, muslim, general, ma, fuxiang, and, appointed, him, to, high, ranking, positions, chiang, addressed, ma, fuxiang, s, son, ma,
