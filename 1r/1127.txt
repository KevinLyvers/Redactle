stephen, in, the, battle, of, valea, alb, but, the, lack, of, provisions, and, the, outbreak, of, a, plague, forced, him, to, withdraw, from, moldavia, taking, advantage, of, a, truce, with, matthias,

during, his, last, years, his, son, and, co, ruler, bogdan, iii, played, an, active, role, in, government, stephen, s, long, rule, represented, a, period, of, stability, in, the, history, of, moldavia, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, both, his, subjects, and, foreigners, remembered, him, as, a, great, ruler, modern, romanians, regard, him, as, one, of, their, greatest, national, heroes, and, he, also, endures, as, a, cult, figure, in, moldovenism, after, the, romanian, orthodox, church, canonized, him, in, 1992, he, is, venerated, as, stephen, the, great, and, holy, tefan, cel, mare, i, sf, nt, stephen, was, the, son, of, bogdan, who, was, a, son, of, alexander, the, good, prince, of, moldavia, stephen, s, mother, maria, oltea, was, most, probably, related, to, the, princes, of, wallachia, according, to, historian, radu, florescu, the, date, of, stephen, s, birth, is, unknown, though, historians, estimate, that, he, was, born, between, 1433, and, 1440, one, church, diptych, records, that, he, had, five, siblings, brothers, ioachim, ioan, christea, and, sisters, sorea, and, maria, some, of, stephen, s, biographers, hypothesize, that, c, rstea, arbore, father, of, the, statesman, luca, arbore, was, the, prince, s, fourth, brother, or, that, c, rstea, was, the, same, as, ioachim, these, links, with, the, high, ranking, moldavian, boyars, are, known, to, have, been, preserved, through, matrimonial, connections, maria, who, died, in, 1485, was, the, wife, of, endrea, gatekeeper, of, suceava, stephen, s, other, brother, in, law, isaia, also, held, high, office, at, his, court, the, death, of, alexander, the, good, in, 1432, gave, rise, to, a, succession, crisis, that, lasted, more, than, two, decades, stephen, s, father, seized, the, throne, in, 1449, after, defeating, one, of, his, relatives, with, the, support, of, john, hunyadi, regent, governor, of, hungary, stephen, was, styled, voivode, in, his, father, s, charters, showing, that, he, had, been, made, his, father, s, heir, and, co, ruler, bogdan, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, hunyadi, in, 1450, stephen, fled, to, hungary, after, peter, iii, aaron, who, was, also, alexander, the, good, s, son, murdered, bogdan, in, october, 1451, vlad, epe, who, had, lived, in, moldavia, during, bogdan, ii, s, reign, invaded, wallachia, and, seized, the, throne, with, the, support, of, hunyadi, in, 1456, stephen, either, accompanied, vlad, to, wallachia, during, the, military, campaign, or, joined, him, after, vlad, became, the, ruler, of, wallachia, according, to, reports, from, the, 1480s, stephen, spent, part, of, that, interval, in, br, ila, where, he, fathered, an, illegitimate, son, mircea, with, the, assistance, of, vlad, stephen, stormed, into, moldavia, at, the, head, of, an, army, 6, 000, strong, in, the, spring, of, 1457, according, to, moldavian, chronicles, men, from, the, lower, country, the, southern, region, of, moldavia, joined, him, the, 17th, century, grigore, ureche, wrote, stephen, routed, peter, aaron, at, dolje, ti, on, 12, april, but, peter, aaron, left, moldavia, for, poland, only, after, stephen, inflicted, a, second, defeat, on, him, at, orbic, one, widely, accepted, theory, based, on, ureche, states, that, an, assembly, of, boyars, and, orthodox, clergymen, acclaimed, stephen, the, ruler, of, moldavia, at, direptate, a, meadow, near, suceava, according, to, scholar, constantin, rezachievici, this, elective, custom, has, no, precedent, before, the, 17th, century, and, appears, superfluous, in, stephen, s, case, he, argues, that, it, was, a, legend, fabricated, by, ureche, while, this, election, remains, uncertain, various, historians, agree, that, teoctist, i, metropolitan, of, moldavia, anointed, stephen, prince, to, emphasize, the, sacred, nature, of, his, rule, stephen, styled, himself, by, the, grace, of, god, stephen, voivode, lord, or, hospodar, of, the, moldavian, lands, on, 13, september, 1457, his, use, of, christian, devices, for, legitimization, overlapped, with, a, troubled, context, for, moldavian, orthodoxy, the, attempted, catholic, orthodox, union, had, divided, the, byzantine, rite, churches, into, supporters, and, dissidents, likewise, the, fall, of, constantinople, had, encouraged, local, bishops, to, consider, themselves, independent, of, the, patriarchy, there, is, a, long, standing, dispute, about, whether, teoctist, was, a, dissenter, belonging, to, one, of, the, several, emancipated, orthodox, jurisdictions, or, a, loyalist, of, patriarch, isidore, historian, dan, ioan, mure, an, argues, that, the, evidence, is, for, the, latter, option, because, moldavia, appears, on, the, list, of, patriarchate, jurisdictions, and, because, stephen, though, he, tested, the, patriarch, by, sometimes, using, imperial, titles, such, as, tsar, by, 1473, was, never, threatened, with, excommunication, as, one, of, his, earliest, actions, as, prince, stephen, attacked, poland, to, prevent, casimir, iv, from, supporting, peter, aaron, in, 1458, this, first, military, campaign, established, his, credentials, as, a, military, commander, of, stature, according, to, historian, jonathan, eagles, however, he, wanted, to, avoid, prolonged, conflict, with, poland, because, the, recapture, of, chilia, was, his, principal, aim, chilia, was, an, important, port, on, the, danube, that, peter, iii, of, moldavia, had, surrendered, to, hungary, in, 1448, he, signed, a, treaty, with, poland, on, the, river, dniester, on, 4, april, 1459, he, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, casimir, iv, and, promised, to, support, poland, against, tatar, marauders, casimir, in, turn, pledged, to, protect, stephen, against, his, enemies, and, to, forbid, peter, aaron, from, returning, to, moldavia, peter, aaron, subsequently, left, poland, for, hungary, and, settled, in, sz, kely, land, transylvania, stephen, invaded, sz, kely, land, multiple, times, in, 1461, matthias, corvinus, king, of, hungary, decided, to, support, peter, aaron, giving, him, shelter, in, his, capital, at, buda, in, 1462, stephen, underscored, his, wish, for, good, relations, with, the, ottoman, empire, expelling, from, moldavia, the, franciscans, who, were, agitating, for, a, united, church, and, a, crusade, stephen, continued, to, pay, the, yearly, tribute, to, the, ottoman, empire, initiated, by, his, predecessor, he, also, made, a, new, agreement, with, poland, in, suceava, on, 2, march, 1462, promising, to, personally, swear, fealty, to, casimir, iv, if, the, king, required, it, this, treaty, declared, that, casimir, was, the, sole, suzerain, of, moldavia, prohibiting, stephen, from, alienating, moldavian, territories, without, his, authorization, it, also, obliged, stephen, to, recapture, the, moldavian, territories, that, had, been, lost, obviously, in, reference, to, chilia, written, sources, evidence, that, the, relationship, between, stephen, and, vlad, epe, became, tense, in, early, 1462, on, 2, april, 1462, the, genoese, governor, of, caffa, now, feodosia, in, crimea, informed, casimir, iv, of, poland, that, stephen, had, attacked, wallachia, while, vlad, epe, was, waging, war, against, the, ottomans, the, ottoman, sultan, mehmed, ii, later, invaded, wallachia, in, june, 1462, mehmed, s, secretary, tursun, beg, recorded, that, vlad, epe, had, to, station, 7, 000, soldiers, near, the, wallachian, moldavian, frontier, during, the, sultan, s, invasion, to, protect, his, country, against, his, moldavian, enemies, both, tursun, and, laonikos, chalkokondyles, note, that, stephen, s, troops, were, loyal, to, mehmed, and, directly, involved, in, the, invasion, taking, advantage, of, the, presence, of, the, ottoman, fleet, at, the, danube, delta, stephen, also, laid, siege, to, chilia, in, late, june, according, to, domenico, balbi, the, venetian, envoy, in, istanbul, stephen, and, the, ottomans, besieged, the, fortress, for, eight, days, but, they, could, not, capture, it, because, the, hungarian, garrison, and, epe, s, 7, 000, men, defeated, them, killing, many, turks, stephen, was, seriously, wounded, during, the, siege, suffering, an, injury, on, his, left, calf, or, his, left, foot, that, would, never, heal, his, entire, life, stephen, again, laid, siege, to, chilia, on, 24, january, 1465, the, moldavian, army, bombarded, the, fortress, for, two, days, forcing, the, garrison, to, surrender, on, 25, or, 26, january, the, sultan, s, vassal, radu, the, handsome, voivode, of, wallachia, had, also, laid, claim, to, chilia, thus, the, capture, of, the, port, gave, rise, to, conflicts, not, only, with, hungary, but, also, with, wallachia, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1465, or, earlier, stephen, peacefully, regained, the, fortress, of, hotin, now, khotyn, in, ukraine, on, the, dniester, from, the, poles, to, commemorate, the, capture, of, chilia, stephen, ordered, the, construction, of, the, church, of, the, assumption, of, the, mother, of, god, in, a, glade, on, the, putna, river, in, 1466, it, became, the, central, monument, of, putna, monastery, extended, by, stephen, in, 1467, when, he, donated, the, village, of, vicov, and, finally, consecrated, in, september, 1470, at, matthias, corvinus, instance, the, diet, of, hungary, abolished, all, previous, exemptions, relating, to, the, tax, known,

they, were, ready, to, fight, to, defend, their, liberties, stephen, promised, support, to, them, but, they, yielded, to, corvinus, without, resistance, after, the, king, marched, to, transylvania, corvinus, invaded, moldavia, and, captured, baia, bac, u, roman, and, t, rgu, neam, stephen, assembled, his, army, and, launched, a, crushing, defeat, on, the, invaders, in, the, battle, of, baia, on, 15, december, this, episode, was, presented, in, contemporary, hungarian, chronicles, as, a, defeat, of, stephen, s, armies, however, corvinus, who, received, wounds, in, the, battle, could, only, escape, from, the, battlefield, with, the, help, of, moldavian, boyars, who, had, joined, him, a, group, of, boyars, rose, up, against, stephen, in, the, lower, country, but, he, had, 20, boyars, and, 40, other, landowners, captured, and, executed, before, the, end, of, the, year, stephen, again, swore, loyalty, to, casimir, iv, in, the, presence, of, the, polish, envoy, in, suceava, on, 28, july, 1468, he, conducted, raids, against, transylvania, between, 1468, and, 1471, when, casimir, came, to, lviv, in, february, 1469, to, personally, receive, his, homage, stephen, did, not, go, to, meet, him, in, the, same, year, or, in, early, 1470, tatars, invaded, moldavia, but, stephen, routed, them, in, the, battle, of, lipnic, near, the, dniester, to, strengthen, the, defence, system, along, the, river, stephen, decided, to, erect, new, fortresses, at, old, orhei, and, soroca, around, the, same, time, a, wallachian, army, laid, siege, to, chilia, but, it, could, not, force, the, moldavian, garrison, to, surrender, matthias, corvinus, sent, peace, proposals, to, stephen, his, envoys, sought, casimir, iv, s, advice, on, corvinus, proposals, at, the, sejm, or, general, assembly,

support, poland, casimir, iv, dispatched, an, embassy, to, moldavia, insisting, that, stephen, should, comply, with, his, obligations, stephen, met, the, polish, envoys, in, vaslui, on, 13, july, reminding, them, of, the, hostile, acts, polish, noblemen, committed, along, the, border, and, demanded, the, extradition, of, the, moldavian, boyars, who, had, fled, to, poland, in, parallel, he,

was, also, approaching, mehmed, with, peace, offers, according, to, disputed, reports, by, the, chronicler, jan, d, ugosz, he, was, also, playing, down, the, invasion, as, the, deed, of, some, fugitives, and, brigands, whom, the, sultan, would, want, to, punish, meanwhile, stephen, s, brother, in, law, alexander, seized, the, principality, of, theodoro, in, the, crimea, at, the, head, of, a, moldavian, army, stephen, also, decided, to, expel, his, former, prot, g, basarab, laiot, from, wallachia, because, basarab, had, supported, the, ottomans, during, their, invasion, of, moldavia,

massacre, of, alexander, of, theodoro, and, his, moldavian, retainers, thereafter, the, venetians, who, had, waged, war, against, the, ottomans, since, 1463, regarded, stephen, as, their, principal, ally, with, their, support, stephen, s, envoys, tried, to, persuade, the, holy, see, to, finance, stephen, s, war, directly, instead, of, sending, the, funds, to, matthias, corvinus, the, signoria, of, venice, emphasized, no, one, should, fail, to, understand, the, extent, to, which, stephen, could, influence, the, evolution, of, events, one, way, or, another, referring, to, his, pre, eminent, role, in, the, anti, ottoman, alliance, mehmed, ii, personally, commanded, a, new, invasion, against, moldavia, in, the, summer, of, 1476, this, force, included, 12, 000, wallachians, under, laiot, and, a, retinue, of, moldavians, under, a, certain, alexandru, who, claimed, to, be, stephen, s, brother, the, crimean, tatars, were, the, first, to, break, into, moldavia, at, the, sultan, s, order,

ncioaia, this, contingent, reportedly, attacked, the, ottomans, flank, at, odobe, ti, another, account, repeated, by, ureche, is, that, maria, oltea, forced, her, son, back, into, battle, pushing, him, to, either, return, victorious, or, die, the, byzantine, historian, george, sphrantzes, concluded, that, mehmed, ii, had, suffered, more, defeats, than, victories, during, the, invasion, of, moldavia, from, summer, 1475, during, an, interlude, in, the, rivalry, between, poland, and, hungary, stephen, swore, his, allegiance, to, the, latter, with, hungarian, support, stephen, and, vlad,

basarab, iv, the, younger, stephen, sent, his, envoys, to, rome, and, venice, to, persuade, the, christian, powers, to, continue, the, war, against, the, ottomans, he, and, venice, also, wanted, to, involve, the, great, horde, in, the, anti, ottoman, coalition, but, the, poles, were, unwilling, to, allow, the, tatars, to, cross, their, territories, to, strengthen, his, international, position, stephen, signed, a, new, treaty, with, poland, on, 22, january, 1479, promising, to, personally, swear, fealty, to, casimir, iv, in, colomea, now, kolomyia, in, ukraine, if, the, king, specifically, demanded, it, venice, and, the, ottoman, empire, made, peace, in, the, same, month, hungary, and, poland, in, april, after, basarab, the, younger, paid, homage, to, the, sultan, stephen, had, to, seek, reconciliation, with, the, ottomans, in, may, 1480, he, promised, to, renew, the, annual, tribute, that, he, had, stopped, paying, in, 1473, taking, advantage, of, the, peace, stephen, made, preparations, to, a, new, confrontation, with, the, ottoman, empire, he, again, invaded, wallachia, and, replaced, basarab, the, younger, with, one, mircea, possibly, stephen, s, own, son, but, basarab, regained, wallachia, with, ottoman, support, the, wallachians, and, their, ottoman, allies, broke, into, moldavia, in, the, spring, of, 1481, mehmed, ii, died, in, 1481, the, conflict, between, his, two, sons, bayezid, ii, and, cem, enabled, stephen, to, break, into, wallachia, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, june, he, routed, basarab, the, younger, at, r, mnicu, v, lcea, and, placed, vlad, epe, s, half, brother, vlad, c, lug, rul, vlad, the, monk, on, the, throne, after, basarab, the, younger, returned, with, ottoman, support, stephen, made, a, last, attempt, to, secure, his, influence, in, wallachia, he, again, led, his, army, to, wallachia, and, defeated, basarab, the, younger, who, died, in, the, battle, although, vlad, c, lug, rul, was, restored, he, was, soon, forced, to, accept, the, sultan, s, suzerainty, anticipating, a, new, ottoman, attack, stephen, fortified, his, frontier, with, wallachia, and, entered, an, alliance, with, ivan, iii, of, russia, grand, prince, of, moscow, since, has, ruled, in, moldavia, he, has, not, liked, any, ruler, of, wallachia, he, did, not, wish, to, live, with, nor, with, nor, with, me, i, do, not, know, who, can, live, with, him, matthias, corvinus, signed, a, five, year, truce, with, bayezid, ii, in, october, 1483, the, truce, applied, to, all, moldavia, with, the, exception, of, the, ports, bayezid, invaded, moldavia, and, captured, chilia, on, 14, or, 15, july, 1484, his, vassal, me, li, i, giray, also, broke, into, moldavia, and, seized, cetatea, alb, on, 3, august, the, capture, of, the, two, ports, secured, the, ottomans, control, of, the, black, sea, bayezid, left, moldavia, only, after, stephen, personally, came, to, pay, homage, to, him, although, this, prostration, was, largely, without, effect, on, moldavian, independence, the, loss, of, chilia, and, cetatea, alb, put, an, end, to, the, moldavian, control, of, important, trading, routes, corvinus, was, unwilling, to, break, his, own, truce, with, bayezid, having, tacit, ottoman, backing, for, his, own, war, in, the, west, however, he, granted, his, vassal, a, territorial, gift, in, transylvania, comprising, the, domains, of, ciceu, and, cetatea, de, balt, according, to, various, interpretations, this, exchange, occurred, in, or, after, 1484, and, was, meant, to, compensate, stephen, for, the, loss, of, his, ports, medievalist, marius, diaconescu, dates, the, lease, of, cetatea, to, 1482, when, corvinus, agreed, to, give, stephen, a, place, of, refuge, should, moldavia, fall, to, the, ottomans, while, ciceu, only, became, stephen, s, castle, in, 1489, both, citadels, were, on, land, confiscated, after, conflicts, between, the, three, nations, and, corvinus, ciceu, had, been, a, fief, of, the, losonczi, family, under, litigation, while, cetatea, had, been, a, special, domain, of, the, voivode, of, transylvania, whose, last, titular, owner, before, stephen, was, john, pongr, c, of, dengeleg, by, then, war, between, the, poles, and, the, ottomans, was, in, preparation, with, clashes, between, the, two, sides, occurring, in, 1484, historian, erban, papacostea, notes, that, casimir, iv, had, always, remained, neutral, during, stephen, s, conflicts, with, the, ottomans, but, the, ottoman, control, of, the, mouths, of, the, dnieper, and, the, danube, threatened, poland, the, king, papacostea, argues, also, wanted, to, strengthen, his, suzerainty, over, moldavia, which, helped, him, decide, to, intervene, in, the, conflict, on, stephen, s, behalf, casimir, formed, or, joined, with, an, anti, ottoman, league, which, in, 1485, had, also, gathered, reluctant, support, from, the, teutonic, knights, historians, provide, different, readings, of, the, issue, according, to, robert, nisbet, bain, casimir, s, intervention, also, drove, the, ottomans, out, of, moldavia, veniamin, ciobanu, however, argues, that, the, polish, involvement, remained, non, military, purely, diplomatic, casimir, then, marched, on, colomea, with, 20, 000, troops, to, secure, his, support, stephen, also, went, to, colomea, and, swore, fealty, to, him, on, 12, september, 1485, the, ceremony, took, place, in, a, tent, but, its, curtains, were, drawn, aside, at, the, moment, when, stephen, was, on, his, knees, before, casimir, three, days, after, stephen, s, oath, of, fealty, casimir, iv, pledged, that, he, would, not, acknowledge, the, capture, of, chilia, and, cetatea, alb, by, the, ottomans, without, stephen, s, consent, during, stephen, s, visit, in, poland, the, ottomans, broke, into, moldavia, and, sacked, suceava, they, also, tried, to, place, a, pretender, peter, hronoda, on, the, throne, stephen, returned, from, poland, and, defeated, the, invaders, with, polish, assistance, at, c, tl, buga, lake, in, november, he, again, confronted, the, ottomans, at, cheia, in, march, 1486, but, could, not, recapture, chilia, and, cetatea, alb, he, narrowly, escaped, with, his, life, reportedly, after, being, helped, by, the, aprod, purice, whom, tradition, identifies, as, patriarch, of, the, movile, ti, family, historian, vasile, m, rcule, agrees, with, ottoman, sources, in, noting, that, cheia, was, not, a, military, victory, for, moldavia, but, overall, a, relative, success, for, his, enemy, skender, pasha, moldavians, reported, winning, the, day, only, because, they, narrowly, avoided, disaster, and, because, hronoda, recognized, a, voivode, by, dissenting, boyars, was, captured, and, beheaded, in, the, end, stephen, signed, a, three, year, truce, with, the, porte, promising, to, pay, the, yearly, tribute, to, the, sultan, researcher, v, j, parry, argues, that, because, the, poles, were, continuously, harassed, by, the, great, horde, they, were, in, no, position, to, help, stephen, eventually, in, late, 1486, poland, announced, plans, of, actually, starting, a, crusade, against, the, ottomans, to, be, led, by, john, albert, stephen, approached, the, sejm, to, negotiate, moldavia, s, role, in, the, affair, he, kept, out, with, the, expedition, being, rerouted, from, lviv, then, attacking, the, tatars, poland, concluded, a, peace, treaty, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1489, acknowledging, the, loss, of, chilia, and, cetatea, alb, without, stephen, s, consent, although, the, treaty, confirmed, moldavia, s, frontiers, stephen, regarded, it, as, a, breach, of, his, 1485, agreement, with, casimir, iv, instead, of, accepting, the, treaty, he, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, matthias, corvinus, however, corvinus, died, unexpectedly, on, 6, april, 1490, four, candidates, laid, claim, to, hungary, including, maximilian, of, habsburg, and, casimir, iv, s, two, sons, john, albert, and, vladislaus, stephen, supported, maximilian, of, habsburg, who, urged, the, three, nations, of, transylvania, to, cooperate, with, stephen, against, his, opponents, most, hungarian, lords, and, prelates, however, supported, vladislaus, who, was, crowned, king, on, 21, september, forcing, maximilian, to, withdraw, from, hungary, in, november, for, john, albert, who, was, his, father, s, heir, in, poland, did, not, abandon, his, claim, stephen, decided, to, support, vladislaus, in, order, to, prevent, a, personal, union, between, hungary, and, poland, he, broke, into, poland, and, captured, pocu, ia, now, pokuttya, in, ukraine, he, believed, that, he, was, entitled, to, this, former, moldavian, fief, its, revenue, redirected, toward, paying, the, ottoman, tribute, stephen, also, supported, vladislaus, against, the, ottomans, who, broke, into, hungary, several, times, after, corvinus, death, in, exchange, vladislaus, confirmed, stephen, s, claim, to, ciceu, and, cetatea, de, balt, in, transylvania, john, albert, in, turn, was, forced, to, acknowledge, his, brother, as, the, lawful, king, in, late, 1491, casimir, iv, died, on, 7, june, 1492, one, of, his, younger, sons, alexander, succeeded, him, in, lithuania, and, john, albert, was, elected, king, of, poland, in, late, august, ivan, iii, of, moscow, broke, into, lithuania, to, expand, his, authority, over, the, principalities, along, the, borderlands, during, the, following, years, ivan, and, stephen, coordinated, their, diplomacy, which, enabled, ivan, to, persuade, alexander, to, acknowledge, the, loss, of, significant, territories, to, moscow, in, february, 1494, ottoman, pressure, also, brought, about, a, rapprochement, between, hungary, and, poland, vladislaus, met, his, four, brothers, including, john, albert, and, sigismund, in, l, cse, now, levo, a, in, slovakia, in, april, 1494, they, planned, a, crusade, against, the, ottoman, empire, however, john, albert, wanted, to, strengthen, polish, suzerainty, over, moldavia, and, to, dethrone, stephen, in, favour, of, sigismund, which, gave, rise, to, new, tensions, between, poland, and, hungary, shortly, after, the, conference, john, albert, decided, to, launch, a, campaign, against, the, ottomans, to, recapture, chilia, and, cetatea, alb, fearing, that, the, subjugation, of, moldavia, was, john, albert, s, actual, purpose, stephen, made, several, attempts, to, prevent, his, campaign, with, ivan, iii, s, support, he, persuaded, alexander, of, lithuania, not, to, associate, himself, with, john, albert, as, reported, by, the, bychowiec, chronicle, the, lithuanian, magnates, also, condemned, the, war, and, simply, refused, to, cross, the, southern, bug, for, its, part, the, polish, army, marched, across, the, dniester, into, moldavia, in, august, 1497, the, sultan, sent, 500, or, 600, janissaries, to, moldavia, at, stephen, s, request, joining, the, moldavian, forces, gathered, at, roman, stephen, sent, his, chancellor, isaac, to, john, albert, requesting, the, withdrawal, of, polish, forces, from, moldavia, but, john, albert, had, isaac, imprisoned, the, poles, then, laid, siege, to, suceava, on, 24, september, the, campaign, failed, teutonic, reinforcements, never, arrived, with, johann, von, tiefen, dying, on, the, way, before, long, a, plague, broke, out, in, the, polish, camp, while, vladislaus, of, hungary, sent, an, army, of, 12, 000, strong, to, moldavia, forcing, john, albert, to, lift, the, siege, on, 19, october, the, poles, started, to, march, towards, poland, but, stephen, ambushed, and, routed, them, at, a, ravine, in, bukovina, on, 25, and, 26, october, several, raids, into, poland, during, the, following, months, including, the, sacking, of, lviv, yavoriv, and, przemy, l, cemented, his, victory, these, were, either, ordered, and, directed, by, stephen, or, carried, out, through, a, combined, force, of, ottoman, tatar, moldavian, irregulars, commanded, by, malko, o, lu, stephen, made, peace, with, john, albert, only, after, poland, and, hungary, concluded, a, new, alliance, against, the, ottoman, empire, and, moldavia, received, direct, access, to, lviv, s, markets, meanwhile, the, ottoman, campaign, ended, in, disaster, as, a, heavy, winter, induced, famine, various, polish, and, lithuanian, reports, also, suggest, that, stephen, ordered, false, flag, attacks, against, his, panicking, former, allies, from, about, 1498, power, in, moldavia, quietly, shifted, toward, a, group, of, boyars, and, administrators, comprising, among, others, luca, arbore, and, ioan, t, utu, stephen, s, son, and, co, ruler, bogdan, was, also, taking, on, princely, responsibilities, from, his, father, he, conducted, the, negotiations, with, poland, about, a, peace, treaty, the, treaty, which, stephen, ratified, at, h, rl, u, in, 1499, put, an, end, to, polish, suzerainty, over, moldavia, stephen, again, stopped, paying, tribute, to, the, ottomans, in, 1500, although, by, then, his, health, had, declined, in, february, 1501, his, delegation, arrived, in, venice, asking, for, a, specialist, doctor, as, reported, by, marin, sanudo, his, envoys, also, discussed, the, possibility, of, moldavia, and, hungary, joining, the, ottoman, venetian, war, the, doge, of, venice, agostino, barbarigo, sent, a, physician, matteo, muriano, to, moldavia, to, treat, his, counterpart, stephen, s, armies, again, broke, into, the, ottoman, empire, but, they, could, not, recapture, chilia, or, cetatea, alb, the, tatars, of, the, great, horde, invaded, southern, moldavia, but, stephen, defeated, them, with, the, support, of, the, crimean, tatars, in, 1502, he, also, sent, reinforcements, to, hungary, to, fight, against, the, ottomans, by, then, however, the, treaty, with, poland, was, no, longer, enforced, prompting, stephen, to, recapture, pocu, ia, in, 1502, although, alexander, of, lithuania, was, by, then, the, new, king, of, poland, no, understanding, could, be, reached, between, him, and, stephen, and, the, two, became, enemies, at, around, that, time, luca, arbore, acting, either, as, stephen, s, envoy, or, on, his, own, stated, a, moldavian, claim, to, halych, and, other, towns, of, the, ruthenian, voivodeship, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, concluded, a, new, peace, treaty, on, 22, february, 1503, which, also, included, moldavia, thereafter, stephen, again, paid, a, yearly, tribute, to, the, ottomans, stephen, survived, his, doctor, who, died, in, moldavia, in, late, 1503, another, moldavian, delegation, was, sent, to, venice, to, ask, for, a, replacement, but, also, to, propose, a, new, alliance, against, the, ottomans, this, was, one, of, his, last, acts, of, international, diplomacy, when, stephen, was, dying, various, boyars, who, opposed, bogdan, rebelled, but, they, were, suppressed, on, his, deathbed, he, had, urged, bogdan, to, continue, to, pay, the, tribute, to, the, sultan, he, died, on, 2, july, 1504, and, was, buried, in, the, monastery, of, putna, a, woman, named, m, ru, ca, or, m, rica, most, probably, gave, birth, to, stephen, s, first, recognized, son, alexandru, historian, ioan, aurel, pop, describes, m, ru, ca, as, stephen, s, first, wife, but, other, researchers, note, that, the, legitimacy, of, the, stephen, m, ru, ca, marriage, is, uncertain, according, to, jonathan, eagles, alexandru, either, died, in, childhood, or, survived, infancy, and, became, his, father, s, co, ruler, this, older, alexandru, died, in, july, 1496, not, before, marrying, a, daughter, of, bartolomeu, dragfi, the, transylvanian, voivode, he, is, probably, not, the, same, alexandru, who, in, 1486, was, sent, by, stephen, as, a, voluntary, hostage, to, istanbul, where, he, married, a, byzantine, noblewoman, this, alexandru, was, still, alive, by, the, end, of, his, father, s, rule, and, beyond, when, he, became, a, pretender, to, the, throne, and, ultimately, a, contested, prince, a, 1538, letter, by, fabio, mignanelli, describes, the, surviving, alexandru, or, sandrin, as, a, posthumous, son, of, stephen, but, this, is, likely, an, error, if, stephen, fathered, two, or, three, sons, named, alexandru, the, one, who, was, for, a, while, his, designated, successor, was, born, to, evdochia, of, kiev, whom, stephen, married, in, 1463, an, olelkovich, she, was, closely, related, both, to, ivan, iii, of, moscow, and, to, casimir, iv, of, poland, and, lithuania, stephen, s, charter, of, grant, to, the, hilandar, monastery, on, mount, athos, refers, to, two, children, of, stephen, and, evdochia, alexandru, and, olena, olena, was, the, wife, of, ivan, molodoy, the, eldest, son, of, ivan, iii, and, mother, of, the, usurped, heir, dmitry, stephen, s, second, or, third, wife, maria, of, mangup, was, of, the, family, of, the, princes, of, theodoro, she, was, probably, also, cousins, with, the, muscovite, grand, princess, sophia, palaiologina, and, was, related, to, trebizond, s, royal, couple, emperor, david, and, empress, maria, the, stephen, maria, marriage, took, place, in, september, 1472, but, she, died, in, december, 1477, during, her, brief, stay, in, moldavia, maria, supported, the, latin, patriarchate, of, constantinople, contributing, to, the, friendly, contacts, between, stephen, and, catholic, powers, stephen, s, third, or, fourth, wife, maria, voichi, a, was, the, daughter, of, radu, the, fair, voivode, of, wallachia, she, was, the, mother, of, stephen, s, immediate, successor, bogdan, and, a, daughter, named, maria, cneajna, the, latter, married, into, the, house, of, sanguszko, stephen, is, known, to, have, fathered, two, other, sons, who, died, in, childhood, at, a, time, when, he, was, married, to, maria, voichi, a, bogdan, died, in, 1479, and, peter, petra, co, in, 1480, scholars, are, divided, as, to, whether, their, mother, was, evdochia, maria, of, mangup, or, a, very, young, maria, voichi, a, bogdan, was, also, known, as, vlad, a, regal, name, rarely, used, in, moldavia, but, common, for, wallachian, princes, the, choice, was, either, an, underlining, of, the, moldo, wallachian, unity, which, prince, stephen, had, sought, to, achieve, or, more, precisely, but, less, certainly, a, proof, that, stephen, wished, to, make, bogdan, vlad, his, co, ruler, over, wallachia, archivist, aurelian, sacerdo, eanu, believes, that, bogdan, vlad, also, had, a, twin, ilia, in, 1480, stephen, finally, recognized, his, first, born, mircea, born, from, his, 1450s, affair, with, c, l, una, of, br, ila, and, groomed, him, to, take, the, throne, in, wallachia, according, to, sacerdo, eanu, recognition, came, only, after, the, death, of, mircea, s, legal, father, who, may, have, been, one, of, the, boyars, spared, at, soci, stephen, also, fathered, another, illegitimate, son, petru, rare, who, became, prince, of, moldavia, in, 1527, the, church, regards, his, mother, maria, rare, as, stephen, s, fourth, wife, although, she, is, known, to, have, been, married, to, a, burgher, stephen, v, locust, who, held, the, moldavian, throne, in, 1538, 1540, also, presented, himself, as, stephen, s, illegitimate, son, according, to, sacerdo, eanu, his, claim, is, credible, a, local, tradition, in, putna, county, today, s, vrancea, attributes, to, stephen, other, extra, conjugal, affairs, with, many, peasants, reporting, that, they, consider, themselves, of, his, blood, or, of, his, marrow, stephen, reigned, for, more, than, 47, years, which, was, in, itself, an, outstanding, achievement, in, the, context, of, the, political, and, territorial, fragility, of, the, romanian, principalities, his, diplomacy, evidenced, that, he, was, one, of, the, most, astute, politicians, of, europe, in, the, 15th, century, this, skill, enabled, him, to, play, off, the, ottoman, empire, poland, and, hungary, against, each, other, according, to, historian, keith, hitchins, stephen, paid, tribute, to, the, ottomans, but, only, when, it, was, advantageous, he, did, homage, to, king, casimir, of, poland, as, his, suzerain, when, that, seemed, wise, and, he, resorted, to, arms, when, other, means, failed, stephen, suppressed, the, rebellious, boyars, and, strengthened, central, government, often, applying, cruel, punishments, including, impalement, he, consolidated, the, practice, of, slavery, including, the, notion, that, different, laws, applied, to, slaves, reportedly, capturing, as, many, as, 17, 000, roma, during, his, invasion, of, wallachia, but, also, selectively, freeing, and, assimilating, tatar, slaves, he, supposedly, used, both, communities, as, slaves, of, the, court, treasuring, their, specialized, skills, nevertheless, one, folk, legend, additionally, claims, that, stephen, practiced, human, sacrifice, against, roma, slaves, to, alleviate, the, floods, at, suli, a, according, to, marcin, bielski, during, the, 1498, expedition, to, poland, the, voivode, participated, in, or, at, least, tolerated, the, capture, of, as, many, as, 100, 000, people, at, least, some, of, these, were, colonized, in, moldavia, where, according, to, various, reports, of, the, period, they, founded, ruthenian, undefended, towns, according, to, historian, mircea, ciubotaru, these, may, include, cernauca, now, chornivka, in, ukraine, dobrov, lipnic, ru, i, ciutea, and, a, cluster, of, villages, outside, h, rl, u, stephen, also, welcomed, freemen, as, settlers, establishing, some, of, the, first, armenian, colonies, in, moldavia, including, one, at, suceava, while, also, settling, italians, some, of, whom, were, escapees, from, the, ottoman, slave, trade, in, that, city, early, on, he, renewed, the, commercial, privileges, of, transylvanian, saxons, who, traded, in, moldavia, but, subsequently, introduced, some, protectionist, barriers, his, own, court, was, staffed, with, foreign, experts, among, them, matteo, muriano, and, the, italian, banker, dorino, cattaneo, however, as, a, crusader, in, the, 1470s, stephen, encouraged, the, religious, persecution, and, extortion, of, gregorian, armenians, jews, and, hussites, some, of, whom, became, supporters, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, addition, to, his, colonization, policies, stephen, restored, crown, lands, that, had, been, lost, during, the, civil, war, that, followed, alexander, the, good, s, rule, either, through, buying, or, confiscating, them, on, the, other, hand, he, granted, much, landed, property, to, the, church, and, to, the, lesser, noblemen, who, were, the, main, supporters, of, the, central, government, his, itinerant, lifestyle, enabled, him, to, personally, hold, court, in, the, whole, of, moldavia, which, contributed, to, the, development, of, his, authority, when, talking, with, muriano, in, 1502, stephen, mentioned, that, he, had, fought, 36, battles, only, losing, two, of, them, when, the, enemy, forces, mostly, outnumbered, his, army, stephen, had, to, adopt, the, tactics, of, asymmetric, warfare, he, practised, guerilla, warfare, against, invaders, avoiding, challenging, them, to, open, battle, before, they, were, weakened, due, to, the, lack, of, supplies, or, sickness, during, his, invasions, however, he, moved, quickly, and, forced, his, enemies, to, do, battle, to, strengthen, the, defence, of, his, country, he, restored, the, fortresses, built, during, alexander, the, good, s, rule, at, hotin, chilia, cetatea, alb, suceava, and, t, rgu, neam, he, also, erected, a, number, of, castles, including, the, new, fortresses, at, roman, and, tighina, the, p, rc, labi, or, commanders, of, the, fortresses, were, invested, with, administrative, and, judicial, powers, and, became, important, pillars, of, royal, administration, their, work, controlled, by, a, new, central, office, the, arma, first, attested, in, 1489, the, p, rc, labi, included, members, of, the, princely, family, such, as, duma, who, was, stephen, s, cousin, before, his, execution, isaia, the, voivode, s, brother, in, law, had, supervised, chilia, and, neam, citadel, stephen, hired, mercenaries, to, man, his, forts, which, diminished, the, military, role, of, the, boyars, retinues, within, the, moldavian, military, forces, he, also, set, up, a, personal, guard, 3, 000, strong,

a, peasant, lacking, arrows, bow, or, sword, or, coming, to, the, army, without, spurs, for, the, horse, he, mercilessly, put, that, man, to, death, the, military, reforms, increased, moldavia, s, military, potential, enabling, stephen, to, muster, an, army, of, more, than, 40, 000, strong, the, years, following, stephen, s, wars, against, the, ottoman, empire, have, been, described, as, the, era, of, cultural, policies, and, great, architectural, upsurge, more, than, a, dozen, stone, churches, were, erected, at, stephen, s, initiative, after, 1487, the, wealthiest, boyars, followed, him, and, stephen, also, supported, the, development, of, monastic, communities, for, instance, the, vorone, monastery, was, built, in, 1488, and, the, monastery, at, tazl, u, in, 1496, to, 1497, the, style, of, the, new, churches, evidences, that, a, genuine, school, of, local, architects, developed, during, stephen, s, reign, they, borrowed, components, of, byzantine, and, gothic, architecture, and, mixed, it, with, elements, of, local, tradition, painted, walls, and, towers, with, a, base, forming, a, star, were, the, most, featuring, elements, of, stephen, s, churches, the, prince, also, financed, the, building, of, churches, in, transylvania, and, wallachia, which, contributed, to, the, spread, of, moldavian, architecture, beyond, the, boundaries, of, the, principality, stephen,

necropolis, of, stephen, s, family, stephen, s, own, tombstone, was, decorated, with, acanthus, leaves, a, motif, adopted, from, byzantine, art, which, became, the, featuring, decorative, element, of, moldavian, art, during, the, following, century, stephen, also, contributed, to, the, development, of, historiography, and, church, slavonic, literature, in, moldavia, he, ordered, the, collection, of, the, annals, of, the, principality, and, initiated, the, completion, of, at, least, three, slavonic, chronicles, noted, in, particular, for, doing, away, with, the, conventions, of, byzantine, literature, and, for, introducing, new, storytelling, canons, some, portions, of, these, historiographic, texts, were, corrected, and, perhaps, even, dictated, by, stephen, himself, the, chronicle, of, bistri, a, which, was, allegedly, the, oldest, chronicle, narrated, the, history, of, moldavia, from, 1359, to, 1506, the, two, versions, of, the, chronicle, of, putna, covered, the, period, from, 1359, to, 1526, but, it, also, wrote, of, the, history, of, the, putna, monastery, they, were, accompanied, by, a, large, number, of, lay, and, religious, texts, including, the, gospels, in, several, versions, by, teodor, m, ri, escul, as, well, as, commentary, on, the, nomocanon, and, slavonic, translations, from, john, climacus, some, were, richly, decorated, with, miniatures, such, as, portraits, of, stephen, in, the, humor, monastery, gospel, 1473, and, his, courtier, ioan, t, utu, psalter, of, mukachevo, 1498, the, moldavian, style, developed, at, neam, monastery, by, the, disciples, of, gavriil, uric, became, influential, outside, moldavia, creating, a, fashion, among, russian, illustrators, and, calligraphers, stephen, received, the, sobriquet, great, shortly, after, his, death, sigismund, i, of, poland, and, lithuania, referred, to, him, as, that, great, stephen, in, 1534, the, polish, historian, martin, kromer, mentioned, him, as, the, great, prince, of, the, moldavians, according, to, maciej, stryjkowski, by, 1580, the, wallachians, and, moldavians, alike, sang, ballads, honoring, stephen, whose, portrait, was, displayed, at, the, court, of, bucharest, his, raids, in, wallachia, were, generally, overlooked, in, such, testimonials, despite, being, honored, for, his, skill, he, was, still, primarily, known, under, sobriquets, indicating, his, standing, and, age, in, 16th, century, moldavia, and, wallachia, he, was, casually, known, as, tefan, cel, vechi, and, tefan, cel, b, tr, n, stephen, the, ancient, or, the, old, oral, history, also, maintained, stephen, s, byzantine, self, references, often, calling, him, an, emperor, or, a, crai, king, of, the, moldavians, in, the, mid, 17th, century, grigore, ureche, described, stephen, as, a, benefactor, and, a, leader, when, writing, of, his, funeral, a, boyar, by, birth, ureche, also, mentioned, stephen, s, despotic, cruelty, bad, temper, and, diminutive, stature, possibly, because, according, to, scholar, lucian, boia, he, resented, authoritarian, princes, in, tandem, local, folklore, came, to, regard, stephen, as, a, protector, of, peasantry, against, noblemen, and, foreign, invaders, for, centuries, free, peasants, claimed, that, they, inherited, their, landed, property, from, their, ancestors, to, whom, it, had, been, granted, by, stephen, for, their, bravery, in, the, battles, such, precedents, also, made, stephen, a, cult, figure, in, romanian, nationalism, which, sought, the, union, of, moldavia, with, wallachia, and, in, rival, moldovenism, early, in, the, 19th, century, the, moldavian, regionalist, gheorghe, asachi, made, stephen, the, topic, of, historical, fiction, popular, prints, and, heraldic, reconstructions, asachi, and, later, teodor, bal, also, campaigned, for, the, erection, of, a, stephen, the, great, statue, which, was, supposed, to, represent, resistance, against, wallachian, encroachment, the, moldavian, separatist, nicolae, istrati, wrote, several, theatrical, works, which, contributed, to, the, stephen, cult, other, moldavians, shunning, separatism, paid, their, own, homage, to, the, medieval, hero, in, the, 1840s, alecu, russo, inaugurated, the, effort, to, collect, and, republish, folklore, about, stephen, which, he, believed, was, the, source, of, truth, about, romanian, history, one, of, the, first, epic, poems, to, deal, with, the, voivode, was, the, aprod, purice, by, constantin, negruzzi, which, fictionalizes, the, battle, of, cheia, in, the, bessarabia, governorate, which, had, been, carved, out, of, moldavia, by, the, russian, empire, the, peasantry, and, intellectual, class, both, appealed, to, stephen, as, a, symbol, of, resistance, his, golden, century, was, a, reference, for, alexandru, h, jdeu, and, bogdan, petriceicu, hasdeu, the, latter, dedicated, him, a, large, number, of, works, from, poems, written, in, his, native, russian, to, romanian, language, historical, novels, in, which, stephen, is, a, leading, protagonist, by, then, the, cult, of, stephen, s, patriotic, virtues, had, been, introduced, to, wallachia, by, ien, chi, v, c, rescu, and, gheorghe, laz, r, wallachian, scholar, nicolae, b, lcescu, was, the, first, romanian, historian, to, describe, stephen, as, a, national, hero, his, rule, b, lcescu, argued, was, an, important, step, towards, the, unification, of, the, lands, inhabited, by, romanians, during, that, period, stephen, became, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, romantic, poetry, of, andrei, mure, anu, in, particular, as, the, mighty, shadow, described, in, romania, s, future, national, anthem, in, 1850s, wallachia, dimitrie, bolintineanu, produced, a, lukewarm, ballad, depicting, stephen, fleeing, for, battle, and, his, mother, oltea, ordering, him, back, it, became, a, hugely, popular, after, being, set, to, music, his, later, works, also, contribute, to, the, nationalist, cult, or, fictionalize, his, erotic, life, the, nationalist, investment, in, stephen, was, by, then, resisted, by, other, writers, in, particular, george, panu, ioan, bogdan, and, other, junimea, members, who, favored, a, critique, of, romantic, nationalism, in, panu, s, works, stephen, appears, as, merely, a, polish, vassal, the, one, time, junimist, a, d, xenopol, also, chided, the, voivode, for, his, loss, of, chilia, and, his, supposed, betrayal, of, wallachia, anniversaries, of, the, most, important, events, of, stephen, s, life, have, been, officially, celebrated, since, the, 1870s, including, in, 1871, the, defiant, show, of, solidarity, at, putna, this, doubled, as, a, protest, against, austria, hungary, which, had, annexed, bukovina, it, was, organized, by, teodor, v, tefanelli, and, was, notably, attended, by, poet, mihai, eminescu, nationalist, interpretations, still, prevailed, particularly, after, 1881, when, eminescu, dedicated, his, poem, doina, written, in, the, style, of, traditional, romanian, song, to, stephen, calling, upon, him, to, leave, his, grave, to, again, lead, his, people, his, statue, was, ultimately, raised, in, ia, i, in, 1883, on, the, 400th, anniversary, of, the, voivode, s, death, in, 1904, ceremonies, included, the, completion, of, a, stone, monument, in, b, rse, ti, by, locals, who, claimed, descent, from, vr, ncioaia, also, then, nicolae, iorga, published, stephen, s, biography, against, xenopol, s, verdict, iorga, emphasized, that, stephen, s, victories, were, to, be, attributed, to, the, true, unity, of, the, whole, people, during, his, reign, many, more, works, of, literature, appeared, in, the, kingdom, of, romania, and, other, romanian, inhabited, regions, helping, to, consolidate, stephen, s, cultural, legacy, one, such, contribution, was, the, 1909, play, apus, de, soare, by, barbu, tef, nescu, delavrancea, including, advice, attributed, in, the, public, s, mind, to, historical, stephen, moldavia, was, not, my, ancestors, was, not, mine, and, is, not, yours, but, belongs, to, our, descendants, and, our, descendants, descendants, to, the, end, of, time, depicting, stephen, as, a, dying, sage, it, was, followed, by, two, other, delavrancea, plays, which, insisted, on, the, prince, s, pragmatic, cruelty, and, the, effects, this, had, on, his, succession, by, then, stephen, as, a, statesman, had, also, become, a, point, of, reference, and, a, benchmark, for, the, long, and, stabilizing, rule, of, carol, i, king, of, romania, over, the, following, three, decades, stephen, s, deeds, became, the, inspiration, for, literary, works, by, iorga, mihai, codreanu, and, especially, mihail, sadoveanu, in, the, 1930s, the, iron, guard, embraced, stephen, the, great, s, cult, for, its, own, purposes, with, special, emphasis, on, his, contribution, as, a, christian, monarch, the, reading, of, stephen, as, a, pan, romanian, nationalist, peaked, during, the, late, stages, of, communist, romania, initially, the, regime, looked, down, on, stephen, s, treatment, of, the, peasantry, and, only, emphasized, his, connections, with, the, east, slavs, or, his, clampdown, against, boyardom, this, stance, was, overturned, by, national, communism, initially, censorship, toned, down, or, removed, references, to, his, legacy, in, soviet, bessarabia, or, pokuttya, in, the, 1980s, however, official, historians, claimed, that, stephen, was, literally, a, lord, of, all, romanians, iorga, s, book, has, been, republished, several, times, including, on, the, 500th, anniversary, of, stephen, s, death, on, the, same, anniversary, stephen, was, presented, as, a, symbol, of, national, identity, independence, and, inter, ethnic, harmony, in, the, republic, of, moldova, where, he, also, endures, as, the, symbol, of, moldavian, particularism, or, moldovan, patriotism, thus, stephen, was, invoked, by, both, the, popular, front, of, moldova, which, favored, romanian, identity, and, the, moldovenist, party, of, communists, the, latter, describes, stephen, as, the, founder, of, moldavian, statehood, claiming, direct, continuity, from, his, principality, to, the, present, day, state, as, eagles, notes, stephen, is, an, ever, present, icon, in, both, romania, and, moldova, statues, of, his, image, abound, politicians, cite, him, as, an, exemplar, schools, and, a, university, bears, his, name, villages, and, the, main, thoroughfares, of, towns, and, cities, are, named, after, him, there, is, a, tefan, cel, mare, metro, station, in, central, bucharest, and, his, crowned, head, has, adorned, every, banknote, in, the, post, soviet, moldovan, republic, according, to, a, 1999, opinion, poll, more, than, 13, of, the, participants, regarded, stephen, the, great, as, the, most, important, personality, who, had, influenced, the, destiny, of, the, romanians, for, the, better, seven, years, later, during, a, programme, called, the, 100, greatest, romanians, on, romanian, television, he, was, voted, the, greatest, romanian, of, all, time, in, athonite, legends, romanian, stories, and, moldavian, chronicles, alike, stephen, s, victories, against, the, ottomans, and, hungarians, were, already, regarded, as, god, inspired, or, as, placed, under, the, direct, patronage, of, various, saints, george, demetrius, procopius, or, mercurius, veneration, of, stephen, himself, was, first, recorded, in, the, 1570s, but, according, to, ureche, he, had, been, regarded, as, a, saint, soon, after, his, funeral, not, on, account, of, his, soul, for, he, was, a, man, with, sins, but, on, account, of, the, great, deeds, he, accomplished, the, positive, nuances, of, ureche, s, report, were, also, repeated, by, miron, costin, the, abbot, of, putna, monastery, artimon, bortnic, initiated, the, investigation, of, the, tomb, room, of, the, monastery, in, 1851, referring, to, important, shrines, in, russia, and, moldavia, in, 1857, a, year, after, stephen, s, tomb, was, opened, the, priest, and, journalist, iraclie, porumbescu, already, wrote, of, the, holy, bones, of, putna, in, at, least, some, legends, attested, by, 1903, the, voivode, is, depicted, as, an, immortal, sleeping, hero, or, alternatively, as, the, ruler, of, heaven, however, stephen, the, great, was, ignored, when, the, romanian, orthodox, church, canonized, the, first, romanian, saints, in, the, 1950s, teoctist, patriarch, of, all, romania, canonized, stephen, along, with, 12, other, saints, at, saint, spyridon, the, new, church, in, bucharest, on, 21, june, 1992, on, this, occasion, the, patriarch, emphasized, that, stephen, had, been, a, defender, of, christianity, and, protector, of, his, people, he, also, underlined, that, stephen, had, built, churches, during, his, reign, stephen, s, feast, day, is, 2, july, the, day, of, his, death, in, the, calendar, of, the, romanian, orthodox, church, on, his, first, feast, after, his, canonization, a, new, ceremony, was, held, to, celebrate, stephen, the, great, and, saint, in, putna, 15, 000, people, including, the, president, of, romania, at, the, time, ion, iliescu, and, two, ministers, attended, the, event, patriarch, teoctist, noted, that, god, has, brought, us, together, under, the, same, skies, just, as, stephen, rallied, us, under, the, same, flag, in, the, past, stephen, s, rule, consolidated, the, usage, of, the, coat, of, arms, of, moldavia, featuring, the, aurochs, head, first, attested, in, 1387, sometimes, as, a, helmet, atop, his, personal, arms, he, revived, the, elaborate, design, introduced, under, alexander, the, good, which, also, featured, a, rose, crescent, sun, and, star, often, but, not, always, five, pointed, its, tinctures, remain, unknown, this, arrangement, was, not, familiar, to, heraldists, in, western, europe, by, the, 1530s, they, represented, moldavia, with, attributed, arms, featuring, maures, these, arms, though, originally, used, for, wallachia, possibly, echoed, stephen, s, victories, over, the, ottomans, the, personal, arms, and, heraldic, flags, used, by, stephen, have, been, the, topic, of, additional, scrutiny, and, debate, stephen, is, known, to, have, used, a, party, per, cross, shield, with, one, striped, quarter, but, the, colors, are, uncertain, one, prevailing, interpretation, is, that, the, dominant, tinctures, were, or, and, vert, although, they, may, also, have, been, gules, and, argent, these, may, derive, from, the, colors, used, by, the, house, of, basarab, which, were, possibly, used, by, stephen, s, in, law, radu, the, handsome, from, the, coat, of, arms, of, hungary, or, from, a, purely, moldavian, tradition, the, division, and, the, striped, pattern, are, possibly, hungarian, they, survived, in, some, of, stephen, s, seals, even, during, his, dispute, with, the, hungarian, crown, he, also, continued, to, use, the, fleur, de, lis, an, angevin, symbol, but, altered, it, into, a, double, headed, lily, then, renounced, it, altogether, similarly, he, used, the, cross, of, lorraine, patt, e, possibly, in, reference, to, the, pahonia, following, his, 1489, dispute, with, poland, that, charge, was, altered, into, a, double, cross, fleury, stephen, s, heraldic, symbols, progressively, merged, with, those, attributed, to, the, house, of, mu, at, and, were, intensively, used, by, all, princes, who, claimed, full, or, partial, descent, from, alexander, the, good, including, peter, the, lame, a, wallachian, pretender, to, moldavia, s, throne, the, putna, tombstones, of, stephen, s, two, sons, who, died, during, his, lifetime, bogdan, and, peter, already, display, the, aurochs, within, the, mu, at, coat, of, arms, a, moldavian, banner, also, survives, in, hand, colored, versions, illustrating, johannes, de, thurocz, s, chronica, hungarorum, with, varying, tinctures, these, were, first, identified, as, stephen, s, flags, by, constantin, karadja, and, described, by, later, authors, as, a, version, of, the, or, an, vert, scheme, in, the, coat, of, arms, other, clues, suggest, that, the, field, was, a, solid, one, of, or, charged, with, an, aurochs, of, or, but, also, that, the, preferred, single, moldavian, color, was, gules, gules, is, also, the, color, of, stephen, s, alleged, war, flag, defaced, with, an, icon, of, saint, george, and, the, dragon, and, donated, by, the, prince, himself, to, zograf, monastery, however, scholar, petre, n, sturel, cautions, that, this, may, not, be, a, heraldic, object, of, any, kind, but, rather, a, votive, offering, the, war, flag, he, notes, is, too, small, to, carry, in, battle, and, does, not, match, with, images, in, either, thurocz, or, marcin, bielski, nor, with, the, description, in, alexander, guagnini
