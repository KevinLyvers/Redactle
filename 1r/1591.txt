hypatia, born, c, 350, 370, died, 415, ad, was, a, neoplatonist, philosopher, astronomer, and, mathematician, who, lived, in, alexandria, egypt, then, part, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, she, was, a, prominent, thinker, in, alexandria, where, she, taught, philosophy, and, astronomy, although, preceded, by, pandrosion, another, alexandrian, female, mathematician, she, is, the, first, female, mathematician, whose, life, is, reasonably, well, recorded, hypatia, was, renowned, in, her, own, lifetime, as, a, great, teacher, and, a, wise, counselor, she, wrote, a, commentary, on, diophantus, s, thirteen, volume, arithmetica, which, may, survive, in, part, having, been, interpolated, into, diophantus, s, original, text, and, another, commentary, on, apollonius, of, perga, s, treatise, on, conic, sections, which, has, not, survived, many, modern, scholars, also, believe, that, hypatia, may, have, edited, the, surviving, text, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, based, on, the, title, of, her, father, theon, s, commentary, on, book, iii, of, the, almagest, hypatia, constructed, astrolabes, and, hydrometers, but, did, not, invent, either, of, these, which, were, both, in, use, long, before, she, was, born, she, was, tolerant, toward, christians, and, taught, many, christian, students, including, synesius, the, future, bishop, of, ptolemais, ancient, sources, record, that, hypatia, was, widely, beloved, by, pagans, and, christians, alike, and, that, she, established, great, influence, with, the, political, elite, in, alexandria, toward, the, end, of, her, life, hypatia, advised, orestes, the, roman, prefect, of, alexandria, who, was, in, the, midst, of, a, political, feud, with, cyril, the, bishop, of, alexandria, rumors, spread, accusing, her, of, preventing, orestes, from, reconciling, with, cyril, and, in, march, 415, ad, she, was, murdered, by, a, mob, of, christians, led, by, a, lector, named, peter, hypatia, s, murder, shocked, the, empire, and, transformed, her, into, a, martyr, for, philosophy, leading, future, neoplatonists, such, as, the, historian, damascius, c, 458, c, 538, to, become, increasingly, fervent, in, their, opposition, to, christianity, during, the, middle, ages, hypatia, was, co, opted, as, a, symbol, of, christian, virtue, and, scholars, believe, she, was, part, of, the, basis, for, the, legend, of, saint, catherine, of, alexandria, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, she, became, a, symbol, of, opposition, to, catholicism, in, the, nineteenth, century, european, literature, especially, charles, kingsley, s, 1853, novel, hypatia, romanticized, her, as, the, last, of, the, hellenes, in, the, twentieth, century, hypatia, became, seen, as, an, icon, for, women, s, rights, and, a, precursor, to, the, feminist, movement, since, the, late, twentieth, century, some, portrayals, have, associated, hypatia, s, death, with, the, destruction, of, the, library, of, alexandria, despite, the, historical, fact, that, the, library, no, longer, existed, during, hypatia, s, lifetime, hypatia, was, the, daughter, of, the, mathematician, theon, of, alexandria, c, 335, c, 405, ad, according, to, classical, historian, edward, j, watts, theon, was, the, head, of, a, school, called, the, mouseion, which, was, named, in, emulation, of, the, hellenistic, mouseion, whose, membership, had, ceased, in, the, 260s, ad, theon, s, school, was, exclusive, highly, prestigious, and, doctrinally, conservative, theon, rejected, the, teachings, of, iamblichus, and, may, have, taken, pride, in, teaching, a, pure, plotinian, neoplatonism, although, he, was, widely, seen, as, a, great, mathematician, at, the, time, theon, s, mathematical, work, has, been, deemed, by, modern, standards, as, essentially, minor, trivial, and, completely, unoriginal, his, primary, achievement, was, the, production, of, a, new, edition, of, euclid, s, elements, in, which, he, corrected, scribal, errors, that, had, been, made, over, the, course, of, nearly, 700, years, of, copying, theon, s, edition, of, euclid, s, elements, became, the, most, widely, used, edition, of, the, textbook, for, centuries, and, almost, totally, supplanted, all, other, editions, nothing, is, known, about, hypatia, s, mother, who, is, never, mentioned, in, any, of, the, extant, sources, theon, dedicates, his, commentary, on, book, iv, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, to, an, individual, named, epiphanius, addressing, him, as, my, dear, son, indicating, that, he, may, have, been, hypatia, s, brother, but, the, greek, word, theon, uses, teknon, does, not, always, mean, son, in, the, biological, sense, and, was, often, used, merely, to, signal, strong, feelings, of, paternal, connection, hypatia, s, exact, year, of, birth, is, still, under, debate, with, suggested, dates, ranging, from, 350, to, 370, ad, many, scholars, have, followed, richard, hoche, in, inferring, that, hypatia, was, born, around, 370, according, to, damascius, s, lost, work, life, of, isidore, preserved, in, the, entry, for, hypatia, in, the, suda, a, tenth, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, hypatia, flourished, during, the, reign, of, arcadius, hoche, reasoned, that, damascius, s, description, of, her, physical, beauty, would, imply, that, she, was, at, most, 30, at, that, time, and, the, year, 370, was, 30, years, prior, to, the, midpoint, of, arcadius, s, reign, in, contrast, theories, that, she, was, born, as, early, as, 350, are, based, on, the, wording, of, the, chronicler, john, malalas, c, 491, 578, who, calls, her, old, at, the, time, of, her, death, in, 415, robert, penella, argues, that, both, theories, are, weakly, based, and, that, her, birth, date, should, be, left, unspecified, hypatia, was, a, neoplatonist, but, like, her, father, she, rejected, the, teachings, of, iamblichus, and, instead, embraced, the, original, neoplatonism, formulated, by, plotinus, the, alexandrian, school, was, renowned, at, the, time, for, its, philosophy, and, alexandria, was, regarded, as, second, only, to, athens, as, the, philosophical, capital, of, the, greco, roman, world, hypatia, taught, students, from, all, over, the, mediterranean, according, to, damascius, she, lectured, on, the, writings, of, plato, and, aristotle, he, also, states, that, she, walked, through, alexandria, in, a, tribon, a, kind, of, cloak, associated, with, philosophers, giving, impromptu, public, lectures, according, to, watts, two, main, varieties, of, neoplatonism, were, taught, in, alexandria, during, the, late, fourth, century, the, first, was, the, overtly, pagan, religious, neoplatonism, taught, at, the, serapeum, which, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, iamblichus, the, second, variety, was, the, more, moderate, and, less, polemical, variety, championed, by, hypatia, and, her, father, theon, which, was, based, on, the, teachings, of, plotinus, although, hypatia, was, a, pagan, she, was, tolerant, of, christians, in, fact, every, one, of, her, known, students, was, christian, one, of, her, most, prominent, pupils, was, synesius, of, cyrene, who, went, on, to, become, a, bishop, of, ptolemais, now, in, eastern, libya, in, 410, afterward, he, continued, to, exchange, letters, with, hypatia, and, his, extant, letters, are, the, main, sources, of, information, about, her, career, seven, letters, by, synesius, to, hypatia, have, survived, but, none, from, her, addressed, to, him, are, extant, in, a, letter, written, in, around, 395, to, his, friend, herculianus, synesius, describes, hypatia, as, a, person, so, renowned, her, reputation, seemed, literally, incredible, we, have, seen, and, heard, for, ourselves, she, who, honorably, presides, over, the, mysteries, of, philosophy, synesius, preserves, the, legacy, of, hypatia, s, opinions, and, teachings, such, as, the, pursuit, of, the, philosophical, state, of, apatheia, complete, liberation, from, emotions, and, affections, the, christian, historian, socrates, of, constantinople, a, contemporary, of, hypatia, describes, her, in, his, ecclesiastical, history, there, was, a, woman, at, alexandria, named, hypatia, daughter, of, the, philosopher, theon, who, made, such, attainments, in, literature, and, science, as, to, far, surpass, all, the, philosophers, of, her, own, time, having, succeeded, to, the, school, of, plato, and, plotinus, she, explained, the, principles, of, philosophy, to, her, auditors, many, of, whom, came, from, a, distance, to, receive, her, instructions, on, account, of, the, self, possession, and, ease, of, manner, which, she, had, acquired, in, consequence, of, the, cultivation, of, her, mind, she, not, infrequently, appeared, in, public, in, the, presence, of, the, magistrates, neither, did, she, feel, abashed, in, going, to, an, assembly, of, men, for, all, men, on, account, of, her, extraordinary, dignity, and, virtue, admired, her, the, more, philostorgius, another, christian, historian, who, was, also, a, contemporary, of, hypatia, states, that, she, excelled, her, father, in, mathematics, and, the, lexicographer, hesychius, of, alexandria, records, that, like, her, father, she, was, also, an, extraordinarily, talented, astronomer, damascius, writes, that, hypatia, was, exceedingly, beautiful, and, fair, of, form, but, nothing, else, is, known, regarding, her, physical, appearance, and, no, ancient, depictions, of, her, have, survived, damascius, states, that, hypatia, remained, a, lifelong, virgin, and, that, when, one, of, the, men, who, came, to, her, lectures, tried, to, court, her, she, tried, to, soothe, his, lust, by, playing, the, lyre, when, he, refused, to, abandon, his, pursuit, she, rejected, him, outright, displaying, her, bloody, menstrual, rags, and, declaring, this, is, what, you, really, love, my, young, man, but, you, do, not, love, beauty, for, its, own, sake, damascius, further, relates, that, the, young, man, was, so, traumatized, that, he, abandoned, his, desires, for, her, immediately, from, 382, 412, the, bishop, of, alexandria, was, theophilus, theophilus, was, militantly, opposed, to, iamblichean, neoplatonism, and, in, 391, he, demolished, the, serapeum, despite, this, theophilus, tolerated, hypatia, s, school, and, seems, to, have, regarded, hypatia, as, his, ally, theophilus, supported, the, bishopric, of, hypatia, s, pupil, synesius, who, describes, theophilus, in, his, letters, with, love, and, admiration, theophilus, also, permitted, hypatia, to, establish, close, relationships, with, the, roman, prefects, and, other, prominent, political, leaders, partly, as, a, result, of, theophilus, s, tolerance, hypatia, became, extremely, popular, with, the, people, of, alexandria, and, exerted, profound, political, influence, theophilus, died, unexpectedly, in, 412, he, had, been, training, his, nephew, cyril, but, had, not, officially, named, him, as, his, successor, a, violent, power, struggle, over, the, diocese, broke, out, between, cyril, and, his, rival, timothy, cyril, won, and, immediately, began, to, punish, the, opposing, faction, he, closed, the, churches, of, the, novatianists, who, had, supported, timothy, and, confiscated, their, property, hypatia, s, school, seems, to, have, immediately, taken, a, strong, distrust, toward, the, new, bishop, as, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, in, all, his, vast, correspondences, synesius, only, ever, wrote, one, letter, to, cyril, in, which, he, treats, the, younger, bishop, as, inexperienced, and, misguided, in, a, letter, written, to, hypatia, in, 413, synesius, requests, her, to, intercede, on, behalf, of, two, individuals, impacted, by, the, ongoing, civil, strife, in, alexandria, insisting, you, always, have, power, and, you, can, bring, about, good, by, using, that, power, he, also, reminds, her, that, she, had, taught, him, that, a, neoplatonic, philosopher, must, introduce, the, highest, moral, standards, to, political, life, and, act, for, the, benefit, of, their, fellow, citizens, according, to, socrates, scholasticus, in, 414, following, an, exchange, of, hostilities, and, a, jewish, led, massacre, cyril, closed, all, the, synagogues, in, alexandria, confiscated, all, the, property, belonging, to, the, jews, and, expelled, a, number, of, jews, from, the, city, scholasticus, suggests, all, the, jews, were, expelled, while, john, of, nikiu, notes, it, was, only, those, involved, in, the, massacre, orestes, the, roman, prefect, of, alexandria, who, was, also, a, close, friend, of, hypatia, and, a, recent, convert, to, christianity, was, outraged, by, cyril, s, actions, and, sent, a, scathing, report, to, the, emperor, the, conflict, escalated, and, a, riot, broke, out, in, which, the, parabalani, a, group, of, christian, clerics, under, cyril, s, authority, nearly, killed, orestes, as, punishment, orestes, had, ammonius, the, monk, who, had, started, the, riot, publicly, tortured, to, death, cyril, tried, to, proclaim, ammonius, a, martyr, but, christians, in, alexandria, were, disgusted, since, ammonius, had, been, killed, for, inciting, a, riot, and, attempting, to, murder, the, governor, not, for, his, faith, prominent, alexandrian, christians, intervened, and, forced, cyril, to, drop, the, matter, nonetheless, cyril, s, feud, with, orestes, continued, orestes, frequently, consulted, hypatia, for, advice, because, she, was, well, liked, among, both, pagans, and, christians, alike, she, had, not, been, involved, in, any, previous, stages, of, the, conflict, and, she, had, an, impeccable, reputation, as, a, wise, counselor, despite, hypatia, s, popularity, cyril, and, his, allies, attempted, to, discredit, her, and, undermine, her, reputation, socrates, scholasticus, mentions, rumors, accusing, hypatia, of, preventing, orestes, from, reconciling, with, cyril, traces, of, other, rumors, that, spread, among, the, christian, populace, of, alexandria, may, be, found, in, the, writings, of, the, seventh, century, egyptian, coptic, bishop, john, of, niki, who, alleges, in, his, chronicle, that, hypatia, had, engaged, in, satanic, practices, and, had, intentionally, hampered, the, church, s, influence, over, orestes, and, in, those, days, there, appeared, in, alexandria, a, female, philosopher, a, pagan, named, hypatia, and, she, was, devoted, at, all, times, to, magic, astrolabes, and, instruments, of, music, and, she, beguiled, many, people, through, her, satanic, wiles, and, the, governor, of, the, city, honoured, her, exceedingly, for, she, had, beguiled, him, through, her, magic, and, he, ceased, attending, church, as, had, been, his, custom, and, he, not, only, did, this, but, he, drew, many, believers, to, her, and, he, himself, received, the, unbelievers, at, his, house, according, to, socrates, scholasticus, during, the, christian, season, of, lent, in, march, 415, a, mob, of, christians, under, the, leadership, of, a, lector, named, peter, raided, hypatia, s, carriage, as, she, was, travelling, home, they, dragged, her, into, a, building, known, as, the, kaisarion, a, former, pagan, temple, and, center, of, the, roman, imperial, cult, in, alexandria, that, had, been, converted, into, a, christian, church, there, the, mob, stripped, hypatia, naked, and, murdered, her, using, ostraka, which, can, either, be, translated, as, roof, tiles, oyster, shells, or, simply, shards, damascius, adds, that, they, also, cut, out, her, eyeballs, they, tore, her, body, into, pieces, and, dragged, her, limbs, through, the, town, to, a, place, called, cinarion, where, they, set, them, on, fire, according, to, watts, this, was, in, line, with, the, traditional, manner, in, which, alexandrians, carried, the, bodies, of, the, vilest, criminals, outside, the, city, limits, to, cremate, them, as, a, way, of, symbolically, purifying, the, city, although, socrates, scholasticus, never, explicitly, identifies, hypatia, s, murderers, they, are, commonly, assumed, to, have, been, members, of, the, parabalani, christopher, haas, disputes, this, identification, arguing, that, the, murderers, were, more, likely, a, crowd, of, alexandrian, laymen, socrates, scholasticus, presents, hypatia, s, murder, as, entirely, politically, motivated, and, makes, no, mention, of, any, role, that, hypatia, s, paganism, might, have, played, in, her, death, instead, he, reasons, that, she, fell, a, victim, to, the, political, jealousy, which, at, that, time, prevailed, for, as, she, had, frequent, interviews, with, orestes, it, was, calumniously, reported, among, the, christian, populace, that, it, was, she, who, prevented, orestes, from, being, reconciled, to, the, bishop, socrates, scholasticus, unequivocally, condemns, the, actions, of, the, mob, declaring, surely, nothing, can, be, farther, from, the, spirit, of, christianity, than, the, allowance, of, massacres, fights, and, transactions, of, that, sort, the, canadian, mathematician, ari, belenkiy, has, argued, that, hypatia, may, have, been, involved, in, a, controversy, over, the, date, of, the, christian, holiday, of, easter, 417, and, that, she, was, killed, on, the, vernal, equinox, while, making, astronomical, observations, classical, scholars, alan, cameron, and, edward, j, watts, both, dismiss, this, hypothesis, noting, that, there, is, absolutely, no, evidence, in, any, ancient, text, to, support, any, part, of, the, hypothesis, hypatia, s, death, sent, shockwaves, throughout, the, empire, for, centuries, philosophers, had, been, seen, as, effectively, untouchable, during, the, displays, of, public, violence, that, sometimes, occurred, in, roman, cities, and, the, murder, of, a, female, philosopher, at, the, hand, of, a, mob, was, seen, as, profoundly, dangerous, and, destabilizing, although, no, concrete, evidence, was, ever, discovered, definitively, linking, cyril, to, the, murder, of, hypatia, it, was, widely, believed, that, he, had, ordered, it, even, if, cyril, had, not, directly, ordered, the, murder, his, smear, campaign, against, hypatia, had, inspired, it, the, alexandrian, council, was, alarmed, at, cyril, s, conduct, and, sent, an, embassy, to, constantinople, the, advisors, of, theodosius, ii, launched, an, investigation, to, determine, cyril, s, role, in, the, murder, the, investigation, resulted, in, the, emperors, honorius, and, theodosius, ii, issuing, an, edict, in, autumn, of, 416, which, attempted, to, remove, the, parabalani, from, cyril, s, power, and, instead, place, them, under, the, authority, of, orestes, the, edict, restricted, the, parabalani, from, attending, any, public, spectacle, whatever, or, entering, the, meeting, place, of, a, municipal, council, or, a, courtroom, it, also, severely, restricted, their, recruitment, by, limiting, the, total, number, of, parabalani, to, no, more, than, five, hundred, according, to, damascius, cyril, allegedly, only, managed, to, escape, even, more, serious, punishment, by, bribing, one, of, theodosius, s, officials, watts, argues, that, hypatia, s, murder, was, the, turning, point, in, cyril, s, fight, to, gain, political, control, of, alexandria, hypatia, had, been, the, linchpin, holding, orestes, s, opposition, against, cyril, together, and, without, her, the, opposition, quickly, collapsed, two, years, later, cyril, overturned, the, law, placing, the, parabalani, under, orestes, s, control, and, by, the, early, 420s, cyril, had, come, to, dominate, the, alexandrian, council, hypatia, has, been, described, as, a, universal, genius, but, she, was, probably, more, of, a, teacher, and, commentator, than, an, innovator, no, evidence, has, been, found, that, hypatia, ever, published, any, independent, works, on, philosophy, and, she, does, not, appear, to, have, made, any, groundbreaking, mathematical, discoveries, during, hypatia, s, time, period, scholars, preserved, classical, mathematical, works, and, commented, on, them, to, develop, their, arguments, rather, than, publishing, original, works, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, closure, of, the, mouseion, and, the, destruction, of, the, serapeum, may, have, led, hypatia, and, her, father, to, focus, their, efforts, on, preserving, seminal, mathematical, books, and, making, them, accessible, to, their, students, the, suda, mistakenly, states, that, all, of, hypatia, s, writings, have, been, lost, but, modern, scholarship, has, identified, several, works, by, her, as, extant, this, kind, of, authorial, uncertainty, is, typical, of, female, philosophers, from, antiquity, hypatia, wrote, in, greek, which, was, the, language, spoken, by, most, educated, people, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, at, the, time, in, classical, antiquity, astronomy, was, seen, as, being, essentially, mathematical, in, character, furthermore, no, distinction, was, made, between, mathematics, and, numerology, or, astronomy, and, astrology, hypatia, is, now, known, to, have, edited, the, existing, text, of, book, iii, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, it, was, once, thought, that, hypatia, had, merely, revised, theon, s, commentary, on, the, almagest, based, on, the, title, of, theon, s, commentary, on, the, third, book, of, almagest, which, reads, commentary, by, theon, of, alexandria, on, book, iii, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, edition, revised, by, my, daughter, hypatia, the, philosopher, but, based, on, analysis, of, the, titles, of, theon, s, other, commentaries, and, similar, titles, from, the, time, period, scholars, have, concluded, that, hypatia, corrected, not, her, father, s, commentary, but, the, text, of, almagest, itself, her, contribution, is, thought, to, be, an, improved, method, for, the, long, division, algorithms, needed, for, astronomical, computation, the, ptolemaic, model, of, the, universe, was, geocentric, meaning, it, taught, that, the, sun, revolved, around, the, earth, in, the, almagest, ptolemy, proposed, a, division, problem, for, calculating, the, number, of, degrees, swept, out, by, the, sun, in, a, single, day, as, it, orbits, the, earth, in, his, early, commentary, theon, had, tried, to, improve, upon, ptolemy, s, division, calculation, in, the, text, edited, by, hypatia, a, tabular, method, is, detailed, this, tabular, method, might, be, the, astronomical, table, which, historic, sources, attribute, to, hypatia, classicist, alan, cameron, additionally, states, that, it, is, possible, hypatia, may, have, edited, not, only, book, iii, but, all, nine, extant, books, of, the, almagest, hypatia, wrote, a, commentary, on, diophantus, s, thirteen, volume, arithmetica, which, had, been, written, sometime, around, the, year, 250, ad, it, set, out, more, than, 100, mathematical, problems, for, which, solutions, are, proposed, using, algebra, for, centuries, scholars, believed, that, this, commentary, had, been, lost, only, volumes, one, through, six, of, the, arithmetica, have, survived, in, the, original, greek, but, at, least, four, additional, volumes, have, been, preserved, in, an, arabic, translation, produced, around, the, year, 860, the, arabic, text, contains, numerous, expansions, not, found, in, the, greek, text, including, verifications, of, diophantus, s, examples, and, additional, problems, cameron, states, that, the, most, likely, source, of, the, additional, material, is, hypatia, since, hypatia, is, the, only, ancient, writer, known, to, have, written, a, commentary, on, the, arithmetica, and, the, additions, appear, to, follow, the, same, methods, used, by, her, father, theon, the, first, person, to, deduce, that, the, additional, material, in, the, arabic, manuscripts, came, from, hypatia, was, the, nineteenth, century, scholar, paul, tannery, in, 1885, sir, thomas, heath, published, the, first, english, translation, of, the, surviving, portion, of, the, arithmetica, heath, argued, that, surviving, text, of, arithmetica, is, actually, a, school, edition, produced, by, hypatia, to, aid, her, students, according, to, mary, ellen, waithe, hypatia, used, an, unusual, algorithm, for, division, in, the, then, standard, sexagesimal, numeral, system, making, it, easy, for, scholars, to, pick, out, which, parts, of, the, text, she, had, written, the, consensus, that, hypatia, s, commentary, is, the, source, of, the, additional, material, in, the, arabic, manuscripts, of, the, arithmetica, has, been, challenged, by, wilbur, knorr, a, historian, of, mathematics, who, argues, that, the, interpolations, are, of, such, low, level, as, not, to, require, any, real, mathematical, insight, and, that, the, author, of, the, interpolations, can, only, have, been, an, essentially, trivial, mind, in, direct, conflict, with, ancient, testimonies, of, hypatia, s, high, caliber, as, a, philosopher, and, mathematician, cameron, rejects, this, argument, noting, that, theon, too, enjoyed, a, high, reputation, yet, his, surviving, work, has, been, judged, completely, unoriginal, cameron, also, insists, that, hypatia, s, work, on, diophantus, was, what, we, today, might, call, a, school, edition, designed, for, the, use, of, students, rather, than, professional, mathematicians, hypatia, also, wrote, a, commentary, on, apollonius, of, perga, s, work, on, conic, sections, but, this, commentary, is, not, extant, she, also, created, an, astronomical, canon, this, is, believed, to, have, been, either, a, new, edition, of, the, handy, tables, by, the, alexandrian, ptolemy, or, the, aforementioned, commentary, on, his, almagest, based, on, a, close, reading, in, comparison, with, her, supposed, contributions, to, the, work, of, diophantus, knorr, suggests, that, hypatia, may, also, have, edited, archimedes, measurement, of, a, circle, an, anonymous, text, on, isometric, figures, and, a, text, later, used, by, john, of, tynemouth, in, his, work, on, archimedes, measurement, of, the, sphere, a, high, degree, of, mathematical, accomplishment, would, have, been, needed, to, comment, on, apollonius, s, advanced, mathematics, or, the, astronomical, canon, because, of, this, most, scholars, today, recognize, that, hypatia, must, have, been, among, the, leading, mathematicians, of, her, day, one, of, synesius, s, letters, describes, hypatia, as, having, taught, him, how, to, construct, a, silver, plane, astrolabe, as, a, gift, for, an, official, an, astrolabe, is, a, device, used, to, calculate, date, and, time, based, on, the, positions, of, the, stars, and, planets, it, can, also, be, used, to, predict, where, the, stars, and, planets, will, be, on, any, given, date, a, little, astrolabe, or, plane, astrolabe, is, a, kind, of, astrolabe, that, used, stereographic, projection, of, the, celestial, sphere, to, represent, the, heavens, on, a, plane, surface, as, opposed, to, an, armillary, sphere, which, was, globe, shaped, armillary, spheres, were, large, and, normally, used, for, display, whereas, a, plane, astrolabe, was, portable, and, could, be, used, for, practical, measurements, the, statement, from, synesius, s, letter, has, sometimes, been, wrongly, interpreted, to, mean, that, hypatia, invented, the, plane, astrolabe, but, the, plane, astrolabe, was, in, use, at, least, 500, years, before, hypatia, was, born, hypatia, may, have, learned, how, to, construct, a, plane, astrolabe, from, her, father, theon, who, had, written, two, treatises, on, astrolabes, one, entitled, memoirs, on, the, little, astrolabe, and, another, study, on, the, armillary, sphere, in, ptolemy, s, almagest, theon, s, treatise, is, now, lost, but, it, was, well, known, to, the, syrian, bishop, severus, sebokht, 575, 667, who, describes, its, contents, in, his, own, treatise, on, astrolabes, hypatia, and, theon, may, have, also, studied, ptolemy, s, planisphaerium, which, describes, the, calculations, necessary, in, order, to, construct, an, astrolabe, synesius, s, wording, indicates, that, hypatia, did, not, design, or, construct, the, astrolabe, but, acted, as, a, guide, and, mentor, during, the, process, of, constructing, it, in, another, letter, synesius, requests, hypatia, to, construct, him, a, hydroscope, a, device, now, known, as, a, hydrometer, to, determine, the, density, or, specific, gravity, of, liquids, based, on, this, request, it, has, been, claimed, that, hypatia, invented, the, hydrometer, the, minute, detail, in, which, synesius, describes, the, instrument, however, indicates, that, he, assumes, she, has, never, heard, of, the, device, but, trusts, she, will, be, able, to, replicate, it, based, on, a, verbal, description, hydrometers, were, based, on, archimedes, 3rd, century, bc, principles, may, have, been, invented, by, him, and, were, being, described, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, in, a, poem, by, the, roman, author, remnius, although, modern, authors, frequently, credit, hypatia, with, having, developed, a, variety, of, other, inventions, these, other, attributions, may, all, be, discounted, as, spurious, booth, concludes, the, modern, day, reputation, held, by, hypatia, as, a, philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, and, mechanical, inventor, is, disproportionate, to, the, amount, of, surviving, evidence, of, her, life, s, work, this, reputation, is, either, built, on, myth, or, hearsay, as, opposed, to, evidence, either, that, or, we, are, missing, all, of, the, evidence, that, would, support, it, neoplatonism, and, paganism, both, survived, for, centuries, after, hypatia, s, death, and, new, academic, lecture, halls, continued, to, be, built, in, alexandria, after, her, death, over, the, next, 200, years, neoplatonist, philosophers, such, as, hierocles, of, alexandria, john, philoponus, simplicius, of, cilicia, and, olympiodorus, the, younger, made, astronomical, observations, taught, mathematics, and, wrote, lengthy, commentaries, on, the, works, of, plato, and, aristotle, hypatia, was, not, the, last, female, neoplatonist, philosopher, later, ones, include, aedesia, asclepigenia, and, theodora, of, emesa, according, to, watts, however, hypatia, had, no, appointed, successor, no, spouse, and, no, offspring, and, her, sudden, death, not, only, left, her, legacy, unprotected, but, also, triggered, a, backlash, against, her, entire, ideology, hypatia, with, her, tolerance, toward, christian, students, and, her, willingness, to, cooperate, with, christian, leaders, had, hoped, to, establish, a, precedent, that, neoplatonism, and, christianity, could, coexist, peacefully, and, cooperatively, instead, her, death, and, the, subsequent, failure, by, the, christian, government, to, impose, justice, on, her, killers, destroyed, that, notion, entirely, and, led, future, neoplatonists, such, as, damascius, to, consider, christian, bishops, as, dangerous, jealous, figures, who, were, also, utterly, unphilosophical, hypatia, became, seen, as, a, martyr, for, philosophy, and, her, murder, led, philosophers, to, adopt, attitudes, that, increasingly, emphasized, the, pagan, aspects, of, their, beliefs, system, and, helped, create, a, sense, of, identity, for, philosophers, as, pagan, traditionalists, set, apart, from, the, christian, masses, thus, while, hypatia, s, death, did, not, bring, an, end, to, neoplatonist, philosophy, as, a, whole, watts, argues, that, it, did, bring, an, end, to, her, particular, variety, of, it, shortly, after, hypatia, s, murder, a, forged, anti, christian, letter, appeared, under, her, name, damascius, was, anxious, to, exploit, the, scandal, of, hypatia, s, death, and, attributed, responsibility, for, her, murder, to, bishop, cyril, and, his, christian, followers, a, passage, from, damascius, s, life, of, isidore, preserved, in, the, suda, concludes, that, hypatia, s, murder, was, due, to, cyril, s, envy, over, her, wisdom, exceeding, all, bounds, and, especially, in, the, things, concerning, astronomy, damascius, s, account, of, the, christian, murder, of, hypatia, is, the, sole, historical, source, attributing, direct, responsibility, to, bishop, cyril, at, the, same, time, damascius, was, not, entirely, kind, to, hypatia, either, he, characterizes, her, as, nothing, more, than, a, wandering, cynic, and, compares, her, unfavorably, with, his, own, teacher, isidore, of, alexandria, remarking, that, isidorus, greatly, outshone, hypatia, not, just, as, a, man, does, over, a, woman, but, in, the, way, a, genuine, philosopher, will, over, a, mere, geometer, hypatia, s, death, was, similar, to, those, of, christian, martyrs, in, alexandria, who, had, been, dragged, through, the, streets, during, the, decian, persecution, in, 250, other, aspects, of, hypatia, s, life, also, fit, the, mold, for, a, christian, martyr, especially, her, lifelong, virginity, in, the, early, middle, ages, christians, conflated, hypatia, s, death, with, stories, of, the, decian, martyrs, and, she, became, part, of, the, basis, for, the, legend, of, saint, catherine, of, alexandria, a, virgin, martyr, said, to, have, been, exceedingly, wise, and, well, educated, the, earliest, attestation, for, the, cult, of, saint, catherine, comes, from, the, eighth, century, around, three, hundred, years, after, hypatia, s, death, one, story, tells, of, saint, catherine, being, confronted, by, fifty, pagan, philosophers, seeking, to, convert, her, but, instead, converting, all, of, them, to, christianity, through, her, eloquence, another, legend, claimed, that, saint, catherine, had, been, a, student, of, athanasius, of, alexandria, in, the, laodikeia, of, asia, minor, today, denizli, in, turkey, until, late, 19th, century, hypatia, was, venerated, as, identical, to, st, catherine, the, byzantine, suda, encyclopedia, contains, a, very, long, entry, about, hypatia, which, summarizes, two, different, accounts, of, her, life, the, first, eleven, lines, come, from, one, source, and, the, rest, of, the, entry, comes, from, damascius, s, life, of, isidore, most, of, the, first, eleven, lines, of, the, entry, probably, come, from, hesychius, s, onomatologos, but, some, parts, are, of, unknown, origin, including, a, claim, that, she, was, the, wife, of, isidore, the, philosopher, apparently, isidore, of, alexandria, watts, describes, this, as, a, very, puzzling, claim, not, only, because, isidore, of, alexandria, was, not, born, until, long, after, hypatia, s, death, and, no, other, philosopher, of, that, name, contemporary, with, hypatia, is, known, but, also, because, it, contradicts, damascius, s, own, statement, quoted, in, the, same, entry, about, hypatia, being, a, lifelong, virgin, watts, suggests, that, someone, probably, misunderstood, the, meaning, of, the, word, gyn, used, by, damascius, to, describe, hypatia, in, his, life, of, isidore, since, the, same, word, can, mean, either, woman, or, wife, the, byzantine, and, christian, intellectual, photios, c, 810, 820, 893, includes, both, damascius, s, account, of, hypatia, and, socrates, scholasticus, s, in, his, bibliotheke, in, his, own, comments, photios, remarks, on, hypatia, s, great, fame, as, a, scholar, but, does, not, mention, her, death, perhaps, indicating, that, he, saw, her, scholarly, work, as, more, significant, the, intellectual, eudokia, makrembolitissa, 1021, 1096, the, second, wife, of, byzantine, emperor, constantine, x, doukas, was, described, by, the, historian, nicephorus, gregoras, as, a, second, hypatia, early, eighteenth, century, deist, scholar, john, toland, used, the, murder, of, hypatia, as, the, basis, for, an, anti, catholic, tract, portraying, hypatia, s, death, in, the, worst, possible, light, by, changing, the, story, and, inventing, elements, not, found, in, any, of, the, ancient, sources, a, 1721, response, by, thomas, lewis, defended, cyril, rejected, damascius, s, account, as, unreliable, because, its, author, was, a, heathen, and, argued, that, socrates, scholasticus, was, a, puritan, who, was, consistently, biased, against, cyril, voltaire, in, his, examen, important, de, milord, bolingbroke, ou, le, tombeau, de, fanatisme, 1736, interpreted, hypatia, as, a, believer, in, the, laws, of, rational, nature, and, the, capacities, of, the, human, mind, free, of, dogmas, and, described, her, death, as, a, bestial, murder, perpetrated, by, cyril, s, tonsured, hounds, with, a, fanatical, gang, at, their, heels, later, in, an, entry, for, his, dictionnaire, philosophique, 1772, voltaire, again, portrayed, hypatia, as, a, freethinking, deistic, genius, brutally, murdered, by, ignorant, and, misunderstanding, christians, most, of, the, entry, ignores, hypatia, altogether, and, instead, deals, with, the, controversy, over, whether, or, not, cyril, was, responsible, for, her, death, voltaire, concludes, with, the, snide, remark, that, when, one, strips, beautiful, women, naked, it, is, not, to, massacre, them, in, his, monumental, work, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, english, historian, edward, gibbon, expanded, on, toland, and, voltaire, s, misleading, portrayals, by, declaring, cyril, as, the, sole, cause, of, all, evil, in, alexandria, at, the, beginning, of, the, fifth, century, and, construing, hypatia, s, murder, as, evidence, to, support, his, thesis, that, the, rise, of, christianity, hastened, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, he, remarks, on, cyril, s, continued, veneration, as, a, christian, saint, commenting, that, superstition, perhaps, would, more, gently, expiate, the, blood, of, a, virgin, than, the, banishment, of, a, saint, in, response, to, these, accusations, catholic, authors, as, well, as, some, french, protestants, insisted, with, increased, vehemence, that, cyril, had, absolutely, no, involvement, in, hypatia, s, murder, and, that, peter, the, lector, was, solely, responsible, in, the, course, of, these, heated, debates, hypatia, tended, to, be, cast, aside, and, ignored, while, the, debates, focused, far, more, intently, on, the, question, of, whether, peter, the, lector, had, acted, alone, or, under, cyril, s, orders, in, the, nineteenth, century, european, literary, authors, spun, the, legend, of, hypatia, as, part, of, neo, hellenism, a, movement, that, romanticised, ancient, greeks, and, their, values, interest, in, the, literary, legend, of, hypatia, began, to, rise, diodata, saluzzo, roero, s, 1827, ipazia, ovvero, delle, filosofie, suggested, that, cyril, had, actually, converted, hypatia, to, christianity, and, that, she, had, been, killed, by, a, treacherous, priest, in, his, 1852, hypatie, and, 1857, hypathie, et, cyrille, french, poet, charles, leconte, de, lisle, portrayed, hypatia, as, the, epitome, of, vulnerable, truth, and, beauty, leconte, de, lisle, s, first, poem, portrayed, hypatia, as, a, woman, born, after, her, time, a, victim, of, the, laws, of, history, his, second, poem, reverted, to, the, eighteenth, century, deistic, portrayal, of, hypatia, as, the, victim, of, christian, brutality, but, with, the, twist, that, hypatia, tries, and, fails, to, convince, cyril, that, neoplatonism, and, christianity, are, actually, fundamentally, the, same, charles, kingsley, s, 1853, novel, hypatia, or, new, foes, with, an, old, face, was, originally, intended, as, a, historical, treatise, but, instead, became, a, typical, mid, victorian, romance, with, a, militantly, anti, catholic, message, portraying, hypatia, as, a, helpless, pretentious, and, erotic, heroine, with, the, spirit, of, plato, and, the, body, of, aphrodite, kingsley, s, novel, was, tremendously, popular, it, was, translated, into, several, european, languages, and, remained, continuously, in, print, for, the, rest, of, the, century, it, promoted, the, romantic, vision, of, hypatia, as, the, last, of, the, hellenes, and, was, quickly, adapted, into, a, broad, variety, of, stage, productions, the, first, of, which, was, a, play, written, by, elizabeth, bowers, performed, in, philadelphia, in, 1859, starring, the, writer, in, the, titular, role, on, 2, january, 1893, a, much, higher, profile, stage, play, adaptation, hypatia, written, by, g, stuart, ogilvie, and, produced, by, herbert, beerbohm, tree, opened, at, the, haymarket, theatre, in, london, the, title, role, was, initially, played, by, julia, neilson, and, it, featured, an, elaborate, musical, score, written, by, the, composer, hubert, parry, the, novel, also, spawned, works, of, visual, art, including, an, 1867, image, portraying, hypatia, as, a, young, woman, by, the, early, photographer, julia, margaret, cameron, and, an, 1885, painting, by, charles, william, mitchell, showing, a, nude, hypatia, standing, before, an, altar, in, a, church, at, the, same, time, european, philosophers, and, scientists, described, hypatia, as, the, last, representative, of, science, and, free, inquiry, before, a, long, medieval, decline, in, 1843, german, authors, soldan, and, heppe, argued, in, their, highly, influential, history, of,

a, completely, made, up, physical, exercise, program, which, he, claims, theon, established, for, his, daughter, involving, fishing, horseback, riding, and, rowing, he, claims, that, theon, taught,

where, she, studied, under, plutarch, of, athens, all, of, this, supposed, biographical, information, however, is, completely, fictional, and, is, not, found, in, any, ancient, source, hubbard, even,

reproduced, image, of, her, around, the, same, time, hypatia, was, adopted, by, feminists, and, her, life, and, death, began, to, be, viewed, in, the, light, of, the, women, s, rights, movement, the, author, carlo, pascal, claimed, in, 1908, that, her, murder, was, an, anti, feminist, act, and, brought, about, a, change, in, the, treatment, of, women, as, well, as, the, decline, of, the,

fate, of, this, book, hypatia, s, death, became, symbolic, for, some, historians, for, example, kathleen, wider, proposes, that, the, murder, of, hypatia, marked, the, end, of, classical, antiquity,
