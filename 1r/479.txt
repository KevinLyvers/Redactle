theatre, through, the, 20th, century, the, operas, have, also, influenced, political, discourse, literature, film, and, television, and, have, been, widely, parodied, and, pastiched, by, humorists,

son, in, 1861, to, supplement, his, income, the, younger, gilbert, began, writing, illustrated, stories, poems, and, articles, of, his, own, many, of, which, would, later, be, mined, as, inspiration, for, his, plays, and, operas, particularly, gilbert, s, series, of, illustrated, poems, the, bab, ballads, in, the, bab, ballads, and, his, early, plays, gilbert, developed, a, unique, topsy, turvy, style, in, which, humour, was, derived, by, setting, up, a, ridiculous, premise, and, working, out, its, logical, consequences, however, absurd, director, and, playwright, mike, leigh, described, the, gilbertian, style, as, follows, with, great, fluidity, and, freedom, continually, challenges, our, natural, expectations, first, within, the, framework, of, the, story, he, makes, bizarre, things, happen, and, turns, the, world, on, its, head, thus, the, learned, judge, marries, the, plaintiff, the, soldiers, metamorphose, into, aesthetes, and, so, on, and, nearly, every, opera, is, resolved, by, a, deft, moving, of, the, goalposts, his, genius, is, to, fuse, opposites, with, an, imperceptible, sleight, of, hand, to, blend, the, surreal, with, the, real, and, the, caricature, with, the, natural, in, other, words, to, tell, a, perfectly, outrageous, story, in, a, completely, deadpan, way, gilbert, developed, his, innovative, theories, on, the, art, of, stage, direction, following, the, playwright, and, theatrical, reformer, tom, robertson, at, the, time, gilbert, began, writing, theatre, in, britain, was, in, disrepute, gilbert, helped, to, reform, and, elevate, the, respectability, of, the, theatre, especially, beginning, with, his, six, short, family, friendly, comic, operas, or, entertainments, for, thomas, german, reed, at, a, rehearsal, for, one, of, these, entertainments, ages, ago, in, 1870, the, composer, frederic, clay, introduced, gilbert, to, his, friend, the, young, composer, arthur, sullivan, over, the, next, year, before, the, two, first,

the, first, mendelssohn, scholarship, and, studied, at, the, royal, academy, of, music, and, then, at, leipzig, where, he, also, took, up, conducting, his, graduation, piece, completed, in, 1861, was, a, suite, of, incidental, music, to, shakespeare, s, the, tempest, revised, and, expanded, it, was, performed, at, the, crystal, palace, in, 1862, and, was, an, immediate, sensation, he, began, building, a, reputation, as, england, s, most, promising, young, composer, composing, a, symphony, a, concerto, and, several, overtures, among, them, the, overture, di, ballo, in, 1870, his, early, major, works, for, the, voice, included, the, masque, at, kenilworth, 1864, an, oratorio, the, prodigal, son, 1869, and, a, dramatic, cantata, on, shore, and, sea, 1871, he, composed, a, ballet, l, le, enchant, e, 1864, and, incidental, music, for, a, number, of, shakespeare, plays, other, early, pieces, that, were, praised, were, his, symphony, in, e, cello, concerto, and, overture, in, c, in, memoriam, all, three, of, which, premiered, in, 1866, these, commissions, were, not, sufficient, to, keep, sullivan, afloat, he, worked, as, a, church, organist, and, composed, numerous, hymns, popular, songs, and, parlour, ballads, sullivan, s, first, foray, into, comic, opera, was, cox, and, box, 1866, written, with, the, librettist, f, c, burnand, for, an, informal, gathering, of, friends, public, performance, followed, with, w, s, gilbert, then, writing, dramatic, criticism, for, the, magazine, fun, saying, that, sullivan, s, score, is, in, many, places, of, too, high, a, class, for, the, grotesquely, absurd, plot, to, which, it, is, wedded, nonetheless, it, proved, highly, successful, and, is, still, regularly, performed, today, sullivan, and, burnand, s, second, opera, the, contrabandista, 1867, was, not, as, successful, in, 1871, producer, john, hollingshead, brought, gilbert, and, sullivan, together, to, produce, a, christmas, entertainment, thespis, at, his, gaiety, theatre, a, large, west, end, house, the, piece, was, an, extravaganza, in, which, the, classical, greek, gods, grown, elderly, are, temporarily, replaced, by, a, troupe, of, 19th, century, actors, and, actresses, one, of, whom, is, the, eponymous, thespis, the, greek, father, of, the, drama, its, mixture, of, political, satire, and, grand, opera, parody, mimicked, offenbach, s, orpheus, in, the, underworld, and, la, belle, h, l, ne, which, in, translation, then, dominated, the, english, musical, stage, thespis, opened, on, boxing, day, and, ran, for, 63, performances, it, outran, five, of, its, nine, competitors, for, the, 1871, holiday, season, and, its, run, was, extended, beyond, the, length, of, a, normal, run, at, the, gaiety, but, no, one, at, the, time, foresaw, that, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, great, collaboration, unlike, the, later, gilbert, and, sullivan, works, it, was, hastily, prepared, and, its, nature, was, more, risqu, like, gilbert, s, earlier, burlesques, with, a, broader, style, of, comedy, that, allowed, for, improvisation, by, the, actors, two, of, the, male, characters, were, played, by, women, whose, shapely, legs, were, put, on, display, in, a, fashion, that, gilbert, later, condemned, the, musical, score, to, thespis, was, never, published, and, is, now, lost, except, for, one, song, that, was, published, separately, a, chorus, that, was, re, used, in, the, pirates, of, penzance, and, the, act, ii, ballet, music, over, the, next, three, years, gilbert, and, sullivan, did, not, have, occasion, to, work, together, again, but, each, man, became, more, eminent, in, his, field, gilbert, worked, with, frederic, clay, on, happy, arcadia, 1872, and, alfred, cellier, on, topsyturveydom, 1874, and, wrote, the, wicked, world, 1873, sweethearts, 1874, and, several, other, libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy, comedies, dramas, and, adaptations, sullivan, completed, his, festival, te, deum, 1872, another, oratorio, the, light, of, the, world, 1873, his, only, song, cycle, the, window, or, the, song, of, the, wrens, 1871, incidental, music, to, the, merry, wives, of, windsor, 1874, and, more, songs, parlour, ballads, and, hymns, including, onward, christian, soldiers, 1872, at, the, same, time, the, audience, for, theatre, was, growing, because, of, the, rapidly, expanding, british, population, improvement, in, education, and, the, standard, of, living, especially, of, the, middle, class, improving, public, transport, and, installation, of, street, lighting, which, made, travel, home, from, the, theatre, safer, the, number, of, pianos, manufactured, in, england, doubled, between, 1870, and, 1890, as, more, people, began, to, play, parlour, music, at, home, and, more, theatres, and, concert, halls, opened, in, 1874, gilbert, wrote, a, short, libretto, on, commission, from, producer, conductor, carl, rosa, whose, wife, would, have, played, the, leading, role, but, her, death, in, childbirth, cancelled, the, project, not, long, afterwards, richard, d, oyly, carte, was, managing, the, royalty, theatre, and, needed, a, short, opera, to, be, played, as, an, afterpiece, to, offenbach, s, la, p, richole, carte, knew, about, gilbert, s, libretto, for, rosa, and, suggested, that, sullivan, write, a, score, for, it, gilbert, read, the, piece, to, sullivan, in, february, 1875, and, the, composer, was, delighted, with, it, trial, by, jury, was, composed, and, staged, in, a, matter, of, weeks, the, piece, is, one, of, gilbert, s, humorous, spoofs, of, the, law, and, the, legal, profession, based, on, his, short, experience, as, a, barrister, it, concerns, a, breach, of, promise, of, marriage, suit, the, defendant, argues, that, damages, should, be, slight, since, he, is, such, a, very, bad, lot, while, the, plaintiff, argues, that, she, loves, the, defendant, fervently, and, seeks, substantial, damages, after, much, argument, the, judge, resolves, the, case, by, marrying, the, lovely, plaintiff, himself, with, sullivan, s, brother, fred, as, the, learned, judge, the, opera, was, a, runaway, hit, outlasting, the, run, of, la, p, richole, provincial, tours, and, productions, at, other, theatres, quickly, followed, fred, sullivan, was, the, prototype, for, the, patter, comic, baritone, roles, in, the, later, operas, f, c, burnand, wrote, that, he, was, one, of, the, most, naturally, comic, little, men, i, ever, came, across, he, too, was, a, first, rate, practical, musician, as, he, was, the, most, absurd, person, so, was, he, the, very, kindliest, fred, s, creation, would, serve, as, a, model, for, the, rest, of, the, collaborators, works, and, each, of, them, has, a, crucial, comic, little, man, role, as, burnand, had, put, it, the, patter, baritone, or, principal, comedian, as, these, roles, later, were, called, would, often, assume, the, leading, role, in, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, comic, operas, and, was, usually, allotted, the, speedy, patter, songs, after, the, success, of, trial, by, jury, gilbert, and, sullivan, were, suddenly, in, demand, to, write, more, operas, together, over, the, next, two, years, richard, d, oyly, carte, and, carl, rosa, were, two, of, several, theatrical, managers, who, negotiated, with, the, team, but, were, unable, to, come, to, terms, carte, proposed, a, revival, of, thespis, for, the, 1875, christmas, season, which, gilbert, and, sullivan, would, have, revised, but, he, was, unable, to, obtain, financing, for, the, project, in, early, 1876, carte, requested, that, gilbert, and, sullivan, create, another, one, act, opera, on, the, theme, of, burglars, but, this, was, never, completed, carte, s, real, ambition, was, to, develop, an, english, form, of, light, opera, that, would, displace, the, bawdy, burlesques, and, badly, translated, french, operettas, then, dominating, the, london, stage, he, assembled, a, syndicate, and, formed, the, comedy, opera, company, with, gilbert, and, sullivan, commissioned, to, write, a, comic, opera, that, would, serve, as, the, centrepiece, for, an, evening, s, entertainment, gilbert, found, a, subject, in, one, of, his, own, short, stories, the, elixir, of, love, which, concerned, the, complications, arising, when, a, love, potion, is, distributed, to, all, the, residents, of, a, small, village, the, leading, character, was, a, cockney, businessman, who, happened, to, be, a, sorcerer, a, purveyor, of, blessings, not, much, called, for, and, curses, very, popular, gilbert, and, sullivan, were, tireless, taskmasters, seeing, to, it, that, the, sorcerer, 1877, opened, as, a, fully, polished, production, in, marked, contrast, to, the, under, rehearsed, thespis, while, the, sorcerer, won, critical, acclaim, it, did, not, duplicate, the, success, of, trial, by, jury, nevertheless, it, ran, for, more, than, six, months, and, carte, and, his, syndicate, were, sufficiently, encouraged, to, commission, another, full, length, opera, from, the, team, gilbert, and, sullivan, scored, their, first, international, hit, with, h, m, s, pinafore, 1878, satirising, the, rise, of, unqualified, people, to, positions, of, authority, and, poking, good, natured, fun, at, the, royal, navy, and, the, english, obsession, with, social, status, building, on, a, theme, introduced, in, the, sorcerer, love, between, members, of, different, social, classes, as, with, many, of, the, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, a, surprise, twist, changes, everything, dramatically, near, the, end, of, the, story, gilbert, oversaw, the, designs, of, sets, and, costumes, and, he, directed, the, performers, on, stage, he, sought, realism, in, acting, shunned, self, conscious, interaction, with, the, audience, and, insisted, on, a, standard, of, characterisation, in, which, the, characters, were, never, aware, of, their, own, absurdity, he, insisted, that, his, actors, know, their, words, perfectly, and, obey, his, stage, directions, which, was, something, new, to, many, actors, of, the, day, sullivan, personally, oversaw, the, musical, preparation, the, result, was, a, crispness, and, polish, new, to, the, english, musical, theatre, jessie, bond, wrote, later, h, m, s, pinafore, ran, in, london, for, 571, performances, an, exceptional, run, for, the, period, hundreds, of, unauthorised, or, pirated, productions, of, pinafore, appeared, in, america, during, the, run, of, pinafore, richard, d, oyly, carte, split, up, with, his, former, investors, the, disgruntled, former, partners, who, had, invested, in, the, production, with, no, return, staged, a, public, fracas, sending, a, group, of, thugs, to, seize, the, scenery, during, a, performance, stagehands, managed, to, ward, off, their, backstage, attackers, this, event, cleared, the, way, for, carte, in, alliance, with, gilbert, and, sullivan, to, form, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, which, then, produced, all, their, succeeding, operas, the, libretto, of, h, m, s, pinafore, relied, on, stock, character, types, many, of, which, were, familiar, from, european, opera, and, some, of, which, grew, out, of, gilbert, s, earlier, association, with, the, german, reeds, the, heroic, protagonist, tenor, and, his, love, interest, soprano, the, older, woman, with, a, secret, or, a, sharp, tongue, contralto, the, baffled, lyric, baritone, the, girl, s, father, and, a, classic, villain, bass, baritone, gilbert, and, sullivan, added, the, element, of, the, comic, patter, singing, character, with, the, success, of, h, m, s, pinafore, the, d, oyly, carte, repertory, and, production, system, was, cemented, and, each, opera, would, make, use, of, these, stock, character, types, before, the, sorcerer, gilbert, had, constructed, his, plays, around, the, established, stars, of, whatever, theatre, he, happened, to, be, writing, for, as, had, been, the, case, with, thespis, and, trial, by, jury, building, on, the, team, he, had, assembled, for, the, sorcerer, gilbert, no, longer, hired, stars, he, created, them, he, and, sullivan, selected, the, performers, writing, their, operas, for, ensemble, casts, rather, than, individual, stars, the, repertory, system, ensured, that, the, comic, patter, character, who, performed, the, role, of, the, sorcerer, john, wellington, wells, would, become, the, ruler, of, the, queen, s, navy, as, sir, joseph, porter, in, h, m, s, pinafore, then, join, the, army, as, major, general, stanley, in, the, pirates, of, penzance, and, so, on, similarly, mrs, partlet, in, the, sorcerer, transformed, into, little, buttercup, in, pinafore, then, into, ruth, the, piratical, maid, of, all, work, in, pirates, relatively, unknown, performers, whom, gilbert, and, sullivan, engaged, early, in, the, collaboration, would, stay, with, the, company, for, many, years, becoming, stars, of, the, victorian, stage, these, included, george, grossmith, the, principal, comic, rutland, barrington, the, lyric, baritone, richard, temple, the, bass, baritone, and, jessie, bond, the, mezzo, soprano, soubrette, the, pirates, of, penzance, new, year, s, eve, 1879, also, poked, fun, at, grand, opera, conventions, sense, of, duty, family, obligation, the, respectability, of, civilisation, and, the, peerage, and, the, relevance, of, a, liberal, education, the, story, also, revisits, pinafore, s,

general, and, his, many, daughters, escape, from, the, tender, hearted, pirates, of, penzance, who, are, all, orphans, on, the, false, plea, that, he, is, an, orphan, himself, the, pirates, learn, of, the, deception, and, re, capture, the, major, general, but, when, it, is, revealed, that, the, pirates, are, all, peers, the, major, general, bids, them, resume, your, ranks, and, legislative, duties, and, take, my, daughters, all, of, whom, are, beauties, the, piece, premiered, in, new, york, rather, than, london, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, secure, the, american, copyright, and, was, another, big, success, with, both, critics, and, audiences, gilbert, sullivan, and, carte, tried, for, many, years, to, control, the, american, performance, copyrights, over, their, operas, without, success, nevertheless, pirates, was, a, hit, both, in, new, york, again, spawning, numerous, imitators, and, then, in, london, and, it, became, one, of, the, most, frequently, performed, translated, and, parodied, gilbert, and, sullivan, works, also, enjoying, successful, 1981, broadway, and, 1982, west, end, revivals, by, joseph, papp, that, continue, to, influence, productions, of, the, opera,

henry, hart, milman, concerning, the, 3rd, century, martyrdom, of, st, margaret, of, antioch, sullivan, became, the, conductor, of, the, leeds, festival, beginning, in, 1880, and, conducted, the, performance, the, carl, rosa, opera, company, staged, the, cantata, as, an, opera, in, 1898, patience, 1881, satirised, the, aesthetic, movement, in, general, and, its, colourful, poets, in,

created, the, role, of, bunthorne, based, his, makeup, wig, and, costume, on, swinburne, and, especially, whistler, as, seen, in, the, adjacent, photograph, the, work, also, lampoons, male, vanity, and, chauvinism, in, the, military, the, story, concerns, two, rival, aesthetic, poets, who, attract, the, attention, of, the, young, ladies, of, the, village, formerly, engaged, to, the, members, of,

love, for, him, richard, d, oyly, carte, was, the, booking, manager, for, oscar, wilde, a, then, lesser, known, proponent, of, aestheticism, and, dispatched, him, on, an, american, lecture, tour, in, conjunction, with, the, opera, s, u, s, run, so, that, american, audiences, might, better, understand, what, the, satire, was, all, about, during, the, run, of, patience, carte, built, the, large, modern, savoy, theatre, which, became, the, partnership, s, permanent, home, it, was, the, first, theatre, and, the, world, s, first, public, building, to, be, lit, entirely, by, electric, lighting, patience, moved, into, the, savoy, after, six, months, at, the, opera, comique, and, ran, for, a, total, of, 578, performances, surpassing, the, run, of, h, m, s, pinafore, iolanthe, 1882, was, the, first, of, the, operas, to, open, at, the, savoy, the, fully, electric, savoy, made, possible, numerous, special, effects, such, as, sparkling, magic, wands, for, the, female, chorus, of, fairies, the, opera, poked, fun, at, english, law, and, the, house, of, lords, and, made, much, of, the, war, between, the, sexes, the, critics, felt, that, sullivan, s, work, in, iolanthe, had, taken, a, step, forward, the, daily, telegraph, commented, the, composer, has, risen, to, his, opportunity, and, we, are, disposed, to, account, iolanthe, his, best, effort, in, all, the, gilbertian, series, similarly, the, theatre, judged, that, the, music, of, iolanthe, is, dr, sullivan, s, chef, d, oeuvre, the, quality, throughout, is, more, even, and, maintained, at, a, higher, standard, than, in, any, of, his, earlier, works, iolanthe, is, one, of, several, of, gilbert, s, works, including, the, wicked, world, 1873, broken, hearts, 1875, princess, ida, 1884, and, fallen, fairies, 1909, where, the, introduction, of, men, and, mortal, love, into, a, tranquil, world, of, women, wreaks, havoc, with, the, status, quo, gilbert, had, created, several, fairy, comedies, at, the, haymarket, theatre, in, the, early, 1870s, these, plays, influenced, by, the, fairy, work, of, james, planch, are, founded, upon, the, idea, of, self, revelation, by, characters, under, the, influence, of, some, magic, or, some, supernatural, interference, in, 1882, gilbert, had, a, telephone, installed, in, his, home, and, at, the, prompt, desk, at, the, savoy, theatre, so, that, he, could, monitor, performances, and, rehearsals, from, his, home, study, gilbert, had, referred, to, the, new, technology, in, pinafore, in, 1878, only, two, years, after, the, device, was, invented, and, before, london, even, had, telephone, service, sullivan, had, one, installed, as, well, and, on, 13, may, 1883, at, a, party, to, celebrate, the, composer, s, 41st, birthday, the, guests, including, the, prince, of, wales, later, edward, vii, heard, a, direct, relay, of, parts, of, iolanthe, from, the, savoy, this, was, probably, the, first, live, broadcast, of, an, opera, during, the, run, of, iolanthe, in, 1883, sullivan, was, knighted, by, queen, victoria, although, it, was, the, operas, with, gilbert, that, had, earned, him, the, broadest, fame, the, honour, was, conferred, for, his, services, to, serious, music, the, musical, establishment, and, many, critics, believed, that, this, should, put, an, end, to, his, career, as, a, composer, of, comic, opera, that, a, musical, knight, should, not, stoop, below, oratorio, or, grand, opera, sullivan, despite, the, financial, security, of, writing, for, the, savoy, increasingly, viewed, his, work, with, gilbert, as, unimportant, beneath, his, skills, and, repetitious, furthermore, he, was, unhappy, that, he, had, to, simplify, his, music, to, ensure, that, gilbert, s, words, could, be, heard, but, paradoxically, in, february, 1883, just, after, iolanthe, opened, sullivan, had, signed, a, five, year, agreement, with, gilbert, and, carte, requiring, him, to, produce, a, new, comic, opera, on, six, months, notice, princess, ida, 1884, spoofed, women, s, education, and, male, chauvinism, and, continued, the, theme, from, iolanthe, of, the, war, between, the, sexes, the, opera, is, based, on, tennyson, s, poem, the, princess, a, medley, gilbert, had, written, a, blank, verse, farce, based, on, the, same, material, in, 1870, called, the, princess, and, he, reused, a, good, deal, of, the, dialogue, from, his, earlier, play, in, the, libretto, of, princess, ida, ida, is, the, only, gilbert, and, sullivan, work, with, dialogue, entirely, in, blank, verse, and, is, also, the, only, one, of, their, works, in, three, acts, lillian, russell, had, been, engaged, to, create, the, title, role, but, gilbert, did, not, believe, that, she, was, dedicated, enough, and, when, she, missed, a, rehearsal, he, dismissed, her, princess, ida, was, the, first, of, the, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, that, by, the, partnership, s, previous, standards, was, not, a, success, a, particularly, hot, summer, in, london, did, not, help, ticket, sales, the, piece, ran, for, a, comparatively, short, 246, performances, and, was, not, revived, in, london, until, 1919, sullivan, had, been, satisfied, with, the, libretto, but, two, months, after, ida, opened, sullivan, told, carte, that, it, is, impossible, for, me, to, do, another, piece, of, the, character, of, those, already, written, by, gilbert, and, myself, as, princess, ida, showed, signs, of, flagging, carte, realised, that, for, the, first, time, in, the, partnership, s, history, no, new, opera, would, be, ready, when, the, old, one, closed, on, 22, march, 1884, he, gave, gilbert, and, sullivan, contractual, notice, that, a, new, opera, would, be, required, in, six, months, time, in, the, meantime, when, ida, closed, carte, produced, a, revival, of, the, sorcerer, the, most, successful, of, the, savoy, operas, was, the, mikado, 1885, which, made, fun, of, english, bureaucracy, thinly, disguised, by, a, japanese, setting, gilbert, initially, proposed, a, story, for, a, new, opera, about, a, magic, lozenge, that, would, change, the, characters, which, sullivan, found, artificial, and, lacking, in, human, interest, and, probability, as, well, as, being, too, similar, to, their, earlier, opera, the, sorcerer, as, dramatised, in, the, film, topsy, turvy, the, author, and, composer, were, at, an, impasse, until, 8, may, 1884, when, gilbert, dropped, the, lozenge, idea, and, agreed, to, provide, a, libretto, without, any, supernatural, elements, the, story, focuses, on, a, cheap, tailor, ko, ko, who, is, promoted, to, the, position, of, lord, high, executioner, of, the, town, of, titipu, he, loves, his, ward, yum, yum, but, she, loves, a, musician, who, is, really, the, son, of, the, emperor, of, japan, the, mikado, and, who, is, in, disguise, to, escape, the, attentions, of, the, elderly, and, amorous, katisha, the, mikado, has, decreed, that, executions, must, resume, without, delay, in, titipu, when, news, arrives, that, the, mikado, will, be, visiting, the, town, ko, ko, assumes, that, he, is, coming, to, ascertain, whether, ko, ko, has, carried, out, the, executions, too, timid, to, execute, anyone, ko, ko, cooks, up, a, conspiracy, to, misdirect, the, mikado, which, goes, awry, eventually, ko, ko, must, persuade, katisha, to, marry, him, to, save, his, own, life, and, the, lives, of, the, other, conspirators, with, the, opening, of, trade, between, england, and, japan, japanese, imports, art, and, styles, became, fashionable, and, a, japanese, village, exhibition, opened, in, knightsbridge, london, making, the, time, ripe, for, an, opera, set, in, japan, gilbert, said, i, cannot, give, you, a, good, reason, for, our, piece, being, laid, in, japan, it, afforded, scope, for, picturesque, treatment, scenery, and, costume, and, i, think, that, the, idea, of, a, chief, magistrate, who, is, judge, and, actual, executioner, in, one, and, yet, would, not, hurt, a, worm, may, perhaps, please, the, public, setting, the, opera, in, japan, an, exotic, locale, far, away, from, britain, allowed, gilbert, and, sullivan, to, satirise, british, politics, and, institutions, more, freely, by, clothing, them, in, superficial, japanese, trappings, gilbert, wrote, the, mikado, of, the, opera, was, an, imaginary, monarch, of, a, remote, period, and, cannot, by, any, exercise, of, ingenuity, be, taken, to, be, a, slap, on, an, existing, institution, g, k, chesterton, compared, it, to, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, gilbert, pursued, and, persecuted, the, evils, of, modern, england, till, they, had, literally, not, a, leg, to, stand, on, exactly, as, swift, did, i, doubt, if, there, is, a, single, joke, in, the, whole, play, that, fits, the, japanese, but, all, the, jokes, in, the, play, fit, the, english, about, england, pooh, bah, is, something, more, than, a, satire, he, is, the, truth, several, of, the, later, operas, are, similarly, set, in, foreign, or, fictional, locales, including, the, gondoliers, utopia, limited, and, the, grand, duke, the, mikado, became, the, partnership, s, longest, running, hit, enjoying, 672, performances, at, the, savoy, theatre, and, surpassing, the, runs, of, pinafore, and, patience, it, remains, the, most, frequently, performed, savoy, opera, it, has, been, translated, into, numerous, languages, and, is, one, of, the, most, frequently, played, musical, theatre, pieces, in, history, ruddigore, 1887, a, topsy, turvy, take, on, victorian, melodrama, was, less, successful, than, most, of, the, earlier, collaborations, with, a, run, of, 288, performances, the, original, title, ruddygore, together, with, some, of, the, plot, devices, including, the, revivification, of, ghosts, drew, negative, comments, from, critics, gilbert, and, sullivan, respelled, the, title, and, made, a, number, of, changes, and, cuts, nevertheless, the, piece, was, profitable, and, the, reviews, were, not, all, bad, for, instance, the, illustrated, london, news, praised, the, work, and, both, gilbert, and, especially, sullivan, sir, arthur, sullivan, has, eminently, succeeded, alike, in, the, expression, of, refined, sentiment, and, comic, humour, in, the, former, respect, the, charm, of, graceful, melody, prevails, while, in, the, latter, the, music, of, the, most, grotesque, situations, is, redolent, of, fun, further, changes, were, made, including, a, new, overture, when, rupert, d, oyly, carte, revived, ruddigore, after, the, first, world, war, and, the, piece, was, regularly, performed, by, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, thereafter, some, of, the, plot, elements, of, ruddigore, were, introduced, by, gilbert, in, his, earlier, one, act, opera, ages, ago, 1869, including, the, tale, of, the, wicked, ancestor, and, the, device, of, the, ghostly, ancestors, stepping, out, of, their, portraits, when, ruddigore, closed, no, new, opera, was, ready, gilbert, again, proposed, a, version, of, the, lozenge, plot, for, their, next, opera, and, sullivan, reiterated, his, reluctance, to, set, it, while, the, two, men, worked, out, their, artistic, differences, and, sullivan, finished, other, obligations, carte, produced, revivals, of, such, old, favourites, as, h, m, s, pinafore, the, pirates, of, penzance, and, the, mikado, the, yeomen, of, the, guard, 1888, their, only, joint, work, with, a, serious, ending, concerns, a, pair, of, strolling, players, a, jester, and, a, singing, girl, who, are, caught, up, in, a, risky, intrigue, at, the, tower, of, london, during, the, 16th, century, the, dialogue, though, in, prose, is, quasi, early, modern, english, in, style, and, there, is, no, satire, of, british, institutions, for, some, of, the, plot, elements, gilbert, had, reached, back, to, his, 1875, tragedy, broken, hearts, the, times, praised, the, libretto, it, should, be, acknowledged, that, mr, gilbert, has, earnestly, endeavoured, to, leave, familiar, grooves, and, rise, to, higher, things, although, not, a, grand, opera, the, new, libretto, provided, sullivan, with, the, opportunity, to, write, his, most, ambitious, theatre, score, to, date, the, critics, who, had, recently, lauded, the, composer, for, his, successful, oratorio, the, golden, legend, considered, the, score, to, yeomen, to, be, sullivan, s, finest, including, its, overture, which, was, written, in, sonata, form, rather, than, as, a, sequential, pot, pourri, of, tunes, from, the, opera, as, in, most, of, his, other, overtures, the, daily, telegraph, said, the, accompaniments, are, delightful, to, hear, and, especially, does, the, treatment, of, the, woodwind, compel, admiring, attention, schubert, himself, could, hardly, have, handled, those, instruments, more, deftly, written, for, them, more, lovingly, we, place, the, songs, and, choruses, in, the, yeomen, of, the, guard, before, all, his, previous, efforts, of, this, particular, kind, thus, the, music, follows, the, book, to, a, higher, plane, and, we, have, a, genuine, english, opera, yeomen, was, a, hit, running, for, over, a, year, with, strong, new, york, and, touring, productions, during, the, run, on, 12, march, 1889, sullivan, wrote, to, gilbert, i, have, lost, the, liking, for, writing, comic, opera, and, entertain, very, grave, doubts, as, to, my, power, of, doing, it, you, say, that, in, a, serious, opera, you, must, more, or, less, sacrifice, yourself, i, say, that, this, is, just, what, i, have, been, doing, in, all, our, joint, pieces, and, what, is, more, must, continue, to, do, in, comic, opera, to, make, it, successful, sullivan, insisted, that, the, next, opera, must, be, a, grand, opera, gilbert, did, not, feel, that, he, could, write, a, grand, opera, libretto, but, he, offered, a, compromise, that, sullivan, eventually, accepted, the, two, would, write, a, light, opera, for, the, savoy, and, at, the, same, time, sullivan, a, grand, opera, ivanhoe, for, a, new, theatre, that, carte, was, constructing, to, present, british, opera, after, a, brief, impasse, over, the, choice, of, subject, sullivan, accepted, an, idea, connected, with, venice, and, venetian, life, as, this, seemed, to, me, to, hold, out, great, chances, of, bright, colour, and, taking, music, the, gondoliers, 1889, takes, place, partly, in, venice, and, partly, in, a, kingdom, ruled, by, a, pair, of, gondoliers, who, attempt, to, remodel, the, monarchy, in, a, spirit, of, republican, equality, gilbert, recapitulates, a, number, of, his, earlier, themes, including, the, satire, of, class, distinctions, figuring, in, many, of, his, earlier, librettos, the, libretto, also, reflects, gilbert, s, fascination, with, the, stock, company, act, highlighting, the, absurd, convergence, of, natural, persons, and, legal, entities, which, plays, an, even, larger, part, in, the, next, opera, utopia, limited, press, accounts, were, almost, entirely, favourable, the, illustrated, london, news, reported, gilbert, has, returned, to, the, gilbert, of, the, past, and, everyone, is, delighted, he, is, himself, again, the, gilbert, of, the, bab, ballads, the, gilbert, of, whimsical, conceit, inoffensive, cynicism, subtle, satire, and, playful, paradox, the, gilbert, who, invented, a, school, of, his, own, who, in, it, was, schoolmaster, and, pupil, who, has, never, taught, anybody, but, himself, and, is, never, likely, to, have, any, imitator, this, is, the, gilbert, the, public, want, to, see, and, this, is, the, gilbert, who, on, saturday, night, was, cheered, till, the, audience, was, weary, of, cheering, any, more, sullivan, s, old, collaborator, on, cox, and, box, later, the, editor, of, punch, magazine, f, c, burnand, wrote, to, the, composer, magnificento, i, envy, you, and, w, s, g, being, able, to, place, a, piece, like, this, on, the, stage, in, so, complete, a, fashion, the, opera, enjoyed, a, run, longer, than, any, of, their, other, joint, works, except, for, h, m, s, pinafore, patience, and, the, mikado, there, was, a, command, performance, of, the, gondoliers, for, queen, victoria, and, the, royal, family, at, windsor, castle, in, 1891, the, first, gilbert, and, sullivan, opera, to, be, so, honoured, the, gondoliers, was, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, last, great, success, though, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, working, relationship, was, mostly, cordial, and, even, friendly, it, sometimes, became, strained, especially, during, their, later, operas, partly, because, each, man, saw, himself, as, allowing, his, work, to, be, subjugated, to, the, other, s, and, partly, caused, by, the, opposing, personalities, of, the, two, gilbert, was, often, confrontational, and, notoriously, thin, skinned, though, prone, to, acts, of, extraordinary, kindness, while, sullivan, eschewed, conflict, gilbert, imbued, his, libretti, with, absurdist, topsy, turvy, situations, in, which, the, social, order, was, turned, upside, down, after, a, time, these, subjects, were, often, at, odds, with, sullivan, s, desire, for, realism, and, emotional, content, gilbert, s, political, satire, often, poked, fun, at, the, wealthy, and, powerful, whom, sullivan, sought, out, for, friendship, and, patronage, gilbert, and, sullivan, disagreed, several, times, over, the, choice, of, a, subject, after, each, of, princess, ida, and, ruddigore, which, were, less, successful, than, their, seven, other, operas, from, h, m, s, pinafore, to, the, gondoliers, sullivan, asked, to, leave, the, partnership, saying, that, he, found, gilbert, s, plots, repetitive, and, that, the, operas, were, not, artistically, satisfying, to, him, while, the, two, artists, worked, out, their, differences, in, those, cases, carte, kept, the, savoy, open, with, revivals, of, their, earlier, works, on, each, occasion, after, a, few, months, pause, gilbert, responded, with, a, libretto, that, met, sullivan, s, objections, and, the, partnership, was, able, to, continue, in, april, 1890, during, the, run, of, the, gondoliers, gilbert, challenged, carte, over, the, expenses, of, the, production, among, other, items, to, which, gilbert, objected, carte, had, charged, the, cost, of, a, new, carpet, for, the, savoy, theatre, lobby, to, the, partnership, gilbert, believed, that, this, was, a, maintenance, expense, that, should, be, charged, to, carte, alone, gilbert, confronted, carte, who, refused, to, reconsider, the, accounts, gilbert, stormed, out, and, wrote, to, sullivan, that, i, left, him, with, the, remark, that, it, was, a, mistake, to, kick, down, the, ladder, by, which, he, had, risen, helen, carte, wrote, that, gilbert, had, addressed, carte, in, a, way, that, i, should, not, have, thought, you, would, have, used, to, an, offending, menial, on, 5, may, 1890, gilbert, wrote, to, sullivan, the, time, for, putting, an, end, to, our, collaboration, has, at, last, arrived, i, am, writing, a, letter, to, carte, giving, him, notice, that, he, is, not, to, produce, or, perform, any, of, my, libretti, after, christmas, 1890, as, biographer, andrew, crowther, has, explained, after, all, the, carpet, was, only, one, of, a, number, of, disputed, items, and, the, real, issue, lay, not, in, the, mere, money, value, of, these, things, but, in, whether, carte, could, be, trusted, with, the, financial, affairs, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, gilbert, contended, that, carte, had, at, best, made, a, series, of, serious, blunders, in, the, accounts, and, at, worst, deliberately, attempted, to, swindle, the, others, it, is, not, easy, to, settle, the, rights, and, wrongs, of, the, issue, at, this, distance, but, it, does, seem, fairly, clear, that, there, was, something, very, wrong, with, the, accounts, at, this, time, gilbert, wrote, to, sullivan, on, 28, may, 1891, a, year, after, the, end, of, the, quarrel, that, carte, had, admitted, an, unintentional, overcharge, of, nearly, 1, 000, in, the, electric, lighting, accounts, alone, things, soon, degraded, gilbert, lost, his, temper, with, his, partners, and, brought, a, lawsuit, against, carte, sullivan, supported, carte, by, making, an, affidavit, erroneously, stating, that, there, were, minor, legal, expenses, outstanding, from, a, battle, gilbert, had, in, 1884, with, lillian, russell, when, in, fact, those, expenses, had, already, been, paid, when, gilbert, discovered, this, he, asked, for, a, retraction, of, the, affidavit, sullivan, refused, gilbert, felt, it, was, a, moral, issue, and, could, not, look, past, it, sullivan, felt, that, gilbert, was, questioning, his, good, faith, and, in, any, event, sullivan, had, other, reasons, to, stay, in, carte, s, good, graces, carte, was, building, a, new, theatre, the, royal, english, opera, house, now, the, palace, theatre, to, produce, sullivan, s, only, grand, opera, ivanhoe, after, the, gondoliers, closed, in, 1891, gilbert, withdrew, the, performance, rights, to, his, libretti, vowing, to, write, no, more, operas, for, the, savoy, gilbert, next, wrote, the, mountebanks, with, alfred, cellier, and, the, flop, haste, to, the, wedding, with, george, grossmith, and, sullivan, wrote, haddon, hall, with, sydney, grundy, gilbert, eventually, won, the, lawsuit, but, his, actions, and, statements, had, been, hurtful, to, his, partners, nevertheless, the, partnership, had, been, so, profitable, that, after, the, financial, failure, of, the, royal, english, opera, house, carte, and, his, wife, sought, to, reunite, the, author, and, composer, in, late, 1891, after, many, failed, attempts, at, reconciliation, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, music, publisher, tom, chappell, stepped, in, to, mediate, between, two, of, his, most, profitable, artists, and, within, two, weeks, he, had, succeeded, eventually, leading, to, two, further, collaborations, between, gilbert, and, sullivan, utopia, limited, 1893, their, penultimate, opera, was, a, very, modest, success, and, their, last, the, grand, duke, 1896, was, an, outright, failure, neither, work, entered, the, canon, of, regularly, performed, gilbert, and, sullivan, works, until, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, made, the, first, complete, professional, recordings, of, the, two, operas, in, the, 1970s, gilbert, had, also, offered, sullivan, another, libretto, his, excellency, 1894, but, gilbert, s, insistence, on, casting, nancy, mcintosh, his, protege, from, utopia, led, to, sullivan, s, refusal, and, his, excellency, was, instead, composed, by, f, osmond, carr, meanwhile, the, savoy, theatre, continued, to, revive, the, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, in, between, new, pieces, and, d, oyly, carte, touring, companies, also, played, them, in, repertory, after, the, grand, duke, the, partners, saw, no, reason, to, work, together, again, a, last, unpleasant, misunderstanding, occurred, in, 1898, at, the, premiere, of, sullivan, s, opera, the, beauty, stone, on, 28, may, gilbert, arrived, at, the, savoy, theatre, with, friends, assuming, that, sullivan, had, reserved, some, seats, for, him, instead, he, was, informed, that, sullivan, objected, to, his, presence, the, composer, later, denied, that, this, was, true, the, last, time, they, met, was, at, the, savoy, theatre, on, 17, november, 1898, at, the, celebration, of, the, 21st, anniversary, of, the, first, performance, of, the, sorcerer, they, did, not, speak, to, each, other, sullivan, by, this, time, in, exceedingly, poor, health, died, in, 1900, although, to, the, end, he, continued, to, write, new, comic, operas, for, the, savoy, with, other, librettists, most, successfully, with, basil, hood, in, the, rose, of, persia, 1899, gilbert, also, wrote, several, works, some, with, other, collaborators, in, the, 1890s, by, the, time, of, sullivan, s, death, in, 1900, gilbert, wrote, that, any, memory, of, their, rift, had, been, completely, bridged, over, and, the, most, cordial, relations, existed, between, us, he, stated, that, sullivan, because, he, was, a, composer, of, the, rarest, genius, was, as, modest, and, as, unassuming, as, a, neophyte, should, be, but, seldom, is, i, remember, all, that, he, has, done, for, me, in, allowing, his, genius, to, shed, some, of, its, lustre, upon, my, humble, name, richard, d, oyly, carte, died, in, 1901, and, his, widow, helen, continued, to, direct, the, activities, of, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, at, the, savoy, and, on, tour, gilbert, went, into, semi, retirement, although, he, continued, to, direct, revivals, of, the, savoy, operas, and, wrote, new, plays, occasionally, between, 1906, and, 1909, he, assisted, mrs, carte, in, staging, two, repertory, seasons, at, the, savoy, theatre, these, were, very, popular, and, revived, interest, in, the, works, gilbert, was, knighted, during, the, first, repertory, season, after, sullivan, s, death, gilbert, wrote, only, one, more, comic, opera, fallen, fairies, 1909, music, by, edward, german, which, was, not, a, success, gilbert, died, in, 1911, and, richard, s, son, rupert, d, oyly, carte, took, over, the, opera, company, upon, his, step, mother, s, death, in, 1913, his, daughter, bridget, inherited, the, company, upon, his, death, in, 1948, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, toured, nearly, year, round, except, for, its, many, london, seasons, and, foreign, tours, performing, exclusively, the, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, until, it, closed, in, 1982, during, the, 20th, century, the, company, gave, well, over, 35, 000, performances, the, savoy, operas, from, the, beginning, were, produced, extensively, in, north, america, and, australasia, and, soon, afterwards, in, germany, russia, and, elsewhere, in, europe, and, around, the, world, in, 1922, sir, henry, wood, explained, the, enduring, success, of, the, collaboration, as, follows, sullivan, has, never, had, an, equal, for, brightness, and, drollery, for, humour, without, coarseness, and, without, vulgarity, and, for, charm, and, grace, his, orchestration, is, delightful, he, wrote, with, full, understanding, of, every, orchestral, voice, above, all, his, music, is, perfectly, appropriate, to, the, words, of, which, it, is, the, setting, he, found, the, right, the, only, cadences, to, fit, gilbert, s, happy, and, original, rhythms, and, to, match, gilbert, s, fun, or, to, throw, gilbert, s, frequent, irony, pointed, although, not, savage, into, relief, sullivan, s, music, is, much, more, than, the, accompaniment, of, gilbert, s, libretti, just, as, gilbert, s, libretti, are, far, more, than, words, to, sullivan, s, music, we, have, two, masters, who, are, playing, a, concerto, neither, is, subordinate, to, the, other, each, gives, what, is, original, but, the, two, while, neither, predominates, are, in, perfect, correspondence, this, rare, harmony, of, words, and, music, is, what, makes, these, operas, entirely, unique, they, are, the, work, not, of, a, musician, and, his, librettist, nor, of, a, poet, and, one, who, sets, his, words, to, music, but, of, two, geniuses, g, k, chesterton, similarly, praised, the, combination, of, the, two, artists, anticipating, the, operas, success, into, the, remote, future, he, wrote, that, gilbert, s, satire, was, too, intelligent, to, be, intelligible, by, itself, and, that, perhaps, only, sullivan, could, have, given, wings, to, his, words, in, exactly, the, right, degree, frivolous, and, exactly, the, right, degree, fastidious, precise, degree, of, levity, and, distance, from, reality, seemed, to, be, expressed, in, the, very, notes, of, the, music, almost, in, the, note, of, the, laughter, that, followed, it, in, 1957, a, review, in, the, times, gave, this, rationale, for, the, continued, vitality, of, the, savoy, operas, hey, were, never, really, contemporary, in, their, idiom, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, from, the, first, moment, was, obviously, not, the, audience, s, world, an, artificial, world, with, a, neatly, controlled, and, shapely, precision, which, has, not, gone, out, of, fashion, because, it, was, never, in, fashion, in, the, sense, of, using, the, fleeting, conventions, and, ways, of, thought, of, contemporary, human, society, for, this, each, partner, has, his, share, of, credit, the, neat, articulation, of, incredibilities, in, gilbert, s, plots, is, perfectly, matched, by, his, language, his, dialogue, with, its, primly, mocking, formality, satisfies, both, the, ear, and, the, intelligence, his, verses, show, an, unequalled, and, very, delicate, gift, for, creating, a, comic, effect, by, the, contrast, between, poetic, form, and, prosaic, thought, and, wording, how, deliciously, prick, the, bubble, of, sentiment, equal, importance, gilbert, s, lyrics, almost,

lehrer, in, the, united, states, the, influence, of, gilbert, is, discernible, in, a, vein, of, british, comedy, that, runs, through, john, betjeman, s, verse, via, monty, python, and, private, eye, to, television, series, like, yes, minister, where, the, emphasis, is, on, wit, irony, and, poking, fun, at, the, establishment, from, within, it, in, a, way, which, manages, to, be, both, disrespectful, of, authority, and, yet, cosily, comfortable, and, urbane, the, works, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, are, themselves, frequently, pastiched, and, parodied, well, known, examples, of, this, include, tom, lehrer, s, the, elements, and, clementine, allan, sherman, s, i, m, called, little, butterball, when, i, was, a, lad, you, need, an, analyst, and, the, bronx, bird, watcher, and,

and, television, in, various, ways, that, include, extensive, use, of, sullivan, s, music, or, where, action, occurs, during, a, performance, of, a, gilbert, and, sullivan, opera, such, as, in, the, film, the, girl, said, no, there, are, also, a, number, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, biographical, films, such, as, mike, leigh, s, topsy, turvy, 2000, and, the, story, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, 1953, as, well, as, shows, about, the, partnership, including, a, 1938, broadway, show, knights, of, song, and, a, 1975, west, end, show, called, tarantara, tarantara, it, is, not, surprising, given, the, focus, of, gilbert, on, politics, that, politicians, and, political, observers, have, often, found, inspiration, in, these, works, chief, justice, of, the, united, states, william, rehnquist, added, gold, stripes, to, his, judicial, robes, after, seeing, them, used, by, the, lord, chancellor, in, a, production, of, iolanthe, alternatively, lord, chancellor, charles, falconer, is, recorded,

gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, remain, popular, and, there, are, many, recordings, of, them, most, of, them, are, structured, as, a, potpourri, of, tunes, from, the, operas, they, are, generally, well, orchestrated, but, not, all, of, them, were, composed, by, sullivan, however, even, those, delegated, to, his, assistants, were, based, on, an, outline, he, provided, and, in, many, cases, incorporated, his, suggestions, or, corrections, sullivan, invariably, conducted, them, as, well, as, the, entire, operas, on, opening, night, and, they, were, included, in, the, published, scores, approved, by, sullivan, those, sullivan, wrote, himself, include, the, overtures, to, thespis, iolanthe, princess, ida, the, yeomen, of, the, guard, the, gondoliers, and, the, grand, duke, sullivan, s, authorship, of, the, overture, to, utopia, limited, cannot, be, verified, with, certainty, as, his, autograph, score, is, now, lost, but, it, is, likely, attributable, to, him, as, it, consists, of, only, a, few, bars, of, introduction, followed, by, a, straight, copy, of, music, heard, elsewhere, in, the, opera, the, drawing, room, scene, thespis, is, now, lost, but, there, is, no, doubt, that, sullivan, wrote, its, overture, very, early, performances, of, the, sorcerer, used, a, section, of, sullivan, s, incidental, music, to, shakespeare, s, henry, the, viii, as, he, did, not, have, time, to, write, a, new, overture, but, this, was, replaced, in, 1884, by, one, executed, by, hamilton, clarke, of, those, remaining, the, overtures, to, h, m, s, pinafore, and, the, pirates, of, penzance, are, by, alfred, cellier, the, overture, to, patience, is, by, eugene, d, albert, the, overtures, to, the, mikado, and, ruddigore, are, by, hamilton, clarke, although, the, ruddigore, overture, was, later, replaced, by, one, written, by, geoffrey, toye, most, of, the, overtures, are, in, three, sections, a, lively, introduction, a, slow, middle, section, and, a, concluding, allegro, in, sonata, form, with, two, subjects, a, brief, development, a, recapitulation, and, a, coda, sullivan, himself, did, not, always, follow, this, pattern, the, overture, to, princess, ida, for, instance, has, only, an, opening, fast, section, and, a, concluding, slow, section, the, overture, to, utopia, limited, is, dominated, by, a, slow, section, with, only, a, very, brief, original, passage, introducing, it, in, the, 1920s, the, d, oyly, carte, opera, company, commissioned, its, musical, director, at, the, time, geoffrey, toye, to, write, new, overtures, for, ruddigore, and, the, pirates, of, penzance, toye, s, ruddigore, overture, entered, the, general, repertory, and, today, is, more, often, heard, than, the, original, overture, by, clarke, toye, s, pirates, overture, did, not, last, long, and, is, now, presumed, lost, sir, malcolm, sargent, devised, a, new, ending, for, the, overture, to, the, gondoliers, adding, the, cachucha, from, the, second, act, of, the, opera, this, gave, the, gondoliers, overture, the, familiar, fast, slow, fast, pattern, of, most, of, the, rest, of, the, savoy, opera, overtures, and, this, version, has, competed, for, popularity, with, sullivan, s, original, version, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, have, been, translated, into, many, languages, including, yiddish, hebrew, portuguese, swedish, dutch, danish, estonian, hungarian,

stories, of, h, m, s, pinafore, and, the, mikado, into, children, s, books, called, the, pinafore, picture, book, and, the, story, of, the, mikado, giving, in, some, cases, backstory, that, is, not, found, in, the, librettos, many, other, children, s, books, have, since, been, written, retelling, the, stories, of, the, operas, or, adapting, characters, or, events, from, them, in, the, 19th,
