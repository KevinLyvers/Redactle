konrad, zacharias, lorenz, german, pronunciation, 7, november, 1903, 27, february, 1989, was, an, austrian, zoologist, ethologist, and, ornithologist, he, shared, the, 1973, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, with, nikolaas, tinbergen, and, karl, von, frisch, he, is, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, ethology, the, study, of, animal, behavior, he, developed, an, approach, that, began, with, an, earlier, generation, including, his, teacher, oskar, heinroth, lorenz, studied, instinctive, behavior, in, animals, especially, in, greylag, geese, and, jackdaws, working, with, geese, he, investigated, the, principle, of, imprinting, the, process, by, which, some, nidifugous, birds, i, e, birds, that, leave, their, nest, early, bond, instinctively, with, the, first, moving, object, that, they, see, within, the, first, hours, of, hatching, although, lorenz, did, not, discover, the, topic, he, became, widely, known, for, his, descriptions, of, imprinting, as, an, instinctive, bond, in, 1936, he, met, tinbergen, and, the, two, collaborated, in, developing, ethology, as, a, separate, sub, discipline, of, biology, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, lorenz, the, 65th, most, cited, scholar, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, technical, psychology, journals, introductory, psychology, textbooks, and, survey, responses, lorenz, s, work, was, interrupted, by, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, and, in, 1941, he, was, recruited, into, the, german, army, as, a, medic, in, 1944, he, was, sent, to, the, eastern, front, where, he, was, captured, by, the, soviet, red, army, and, spent, four, years, as, a, german, prisoner, of, war, in, soviet, armenia, after, the, war, he, regretted, his, membership, in, the, nazi, party, lorenz, wrote, numerous, books, some, of, which, such, as, king, solomon, s, ring, on, aggression, and, man, meets, dog, became, popular, reading, his, last, work, here, i, am, where, are, you, is, a, summary, of, his, life, s, work, and, focuses, on, his, famous, studies, of, greylag, geese, lorenz, was, the, son, of, adolf, lorenz, a, wealthy, and, distinguished, surgeon, and, his, wife, emma, n, e, lecher, a, physician, who, had, been, her, husband, s, assistant, the, family, lived, on, a, large, estate, at, altenberg, and, had, a, city, apartment, in, vienna, he, was, educated, at, the, public, schottengymnasium, of, the, benedictine, monks, in, vienna, in, his, autobiographical, essay, published, in, 1973, in, les, prix, nobel, winners, of, the, prizes, are, requested, to, provide, such, essays, lorenz, credits, his, career, to, his, parents, who, were, supremely, tolerant, of, my, inordinate, love, for, animals, and, to, his, childhood, encounter, with, selma, lagerl, f, s, the, wonderful, adventures, of, nils, which, filled, him, with, a, great, enthusiasm, about, wild, geese, at, the, request, of, his, father, adolf, lorenz, he, began, a, premedical, curriculum, in, 1922, at, columbia, university, but, he, returned, to, vienna, in, 1923, to, continue, his, studies, at, the, university, of, vienna, he, graduated, as, doctor, of, medicine, md, in, 1928, and, became, an, assistant, professor, at, the, institute, of, anatomy, until, 1935, he, finished, his, zoological, studies, in, 1933, and, received, his, second, doctorate, phd, while, still, a, student, lorenz, began, developing, what, would, become, a, large, menagerie, ranging, from, domestic, to, exotic, animals, in, his, popular, book, king, solomon, s, ring, lorenz, recounts, that, while, studying, at, the, university, of, vienna, he, kept, a, variety, of, animals, at, his, parents, apartment, ranging, from, fish, to, a, capuchin, monkey, named, gloria, in, 1936, at, an, international, scientific, symposium, on, instinct, lorenz, met, his, great, friend, and, colleague, nikolaas, tinbergen, together, they, studied, geese, wild, domestic, and, hybrid, one, result, of, these, studies, was, that, lorenz, realized, that, an, overpowering, increase, in, the, drives, of, feeding, as, well, as, of, copulation, and, a, waning, of, more, differentiated, social, instincts, is, characteristic, of, very, many, domestic, animals, lorenz, began, to, suspect, and, fear, that, analogous, processes, of, deterioration, may, be, at, work, with, civilized, humanity, this, observation, of, bird, hybrids, caused, lorenz, to, believe, that, domestication, resulting, from, urbanisation, in, humans, might, also, cause, dysgenic, effects, and, to, argue, in, two, papers, that, the, nazi, eugenics, policies, against, this, were, therefore, scientifically, justified, in, 1940, he, became, a, professor, of, psychology, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, he, was, drafted, into, the, wehrmacht, in, 1941, he, sought, to, be, a, motorcycle, mechanic, but, instead, he, was, assigned, as, a, military, psychologist, conducting, racial, studies, on, humans, in, occupied, pozna, under, rudolf, hippius, the, objective, was, to, study, the, biological, characteristics, of, german, polish, half, breeds, to, determine, whether, they, benefited, from, the, same, work, ethics, as, pure, germans, the, degree, to, which, lorenz, participated, in, the, project, is, unknown, but, the, project, director, hippius, referred, a, couple, of, times, to, lorenz, as, an, examining, psychologist, lorenz, later, described, that, he, once, saw, transports, of, concentration, camp, inmates, at, fort, vii, near, pozna, which, made, him, fully, realize, the, complete, inhumanity, of, the, nazis, he, was, sent, to, the, russian, front, in, 1944, where, he, quickly, became, a, prisoner, of, war, in, the, soviet, union, from, 1944, to, 1948, in, captivity, in, soviet, armenia, he, continued, to, work, as, a, medic, and, became, tolerably, fluent, in, russian, and, got, quite, friendly, with, some, russians, mostly, doctors, when, he, was, repatriated, he, was, allowed, to, keep, the, manuscript, of, a, book, he, had, been, writing, and, his, pet, starling, he, arrived, back, in, altenberg, his, family, home, near, vienna, both, with, manuscript, and, bird, intact, the, manuscript, became, his, 1973, book, behind, the, mirror, the, max, planck, society, established, the, lorenz, institute, for, behavioral, physiology, in, buldern, germany, in, 1950, in, his, memoirs, lorenz, described, the, chronology, of, his, war, years, differently, from, what, historians, have, been, able, to, document, after, his, death, he, himself, claimed, that, he, was, captured, in, 1942, where, in, reality, he, was, only, sent, to, the, front, and, captured, in, 1944, leaving, out, entirely, his, involvement, with, the, pozna, project, in, 1958, lorenz, transferred, to, the, max, planck, institute, for, behavioral, physiology, in, seewiesen, he, shared, the, 1973, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, discoveries, in, individual, and, social, behavior, patterns, with, two, other, important, early, ethologists, nikolaas, tinbergen, and, karl, von, frisch, in, 1969, he, became, the, first, recipient, of, the, prix, mondial, cino, del, duca, he, was, a, friend, and, student, of, renowned, biologist, sir, julian, huxley, grandson, of, darwin, s, bulldog, thomas, henry, huxley, famed, psychoanalyst, ralph, greenson, and, sir, peter, scott, were, good, friends, lorenz, and, karl, popper, were, childhood, friends, many, years, after, they, met, during, the, celebration, of, popper, s, 80, years, they, wrote, together, a, book, entitled, die, zukunft, ist, offen, he, retired, from, the, max, planck, institute, in, 1973, but, continued, to, research, and, publish, from, altenberg, and, gr, nau, im, almtal, in, austria, he, died, on, 27, february, 1989, in, altenberg, lorenz, married, his, childhood, friend, margarethe, gebhardt, a, gynaecologist, daughter, of, a, market, gardener, who, lived, near, the, lorenz, family, they, had, a, son, and, two, daughters, he, lived, at, the, lorenz, family, estate, which, included, a, fantastical, neo, baroque, mansion, previously, owned, by, his, father, lorenz, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, the, field, of, ethology, the, study, of, animal, behavior, he, is, best, known, for, his, research, of, the, principle, of, attachment, or, imprinting, through, which, in, some, species, a, bond, is, formed, between, a, newborn, animal, and, its, caregiver, this, principle, had, been, discovered, by, douglas, spalding, in, the, 19th, century, and, lorenz, s, mentor, oskar, heinroth, had, also, worked, on, the, topic, but, lorenz, s, description, of, pr, gung, imprinting, in, nidifugous, birds, such, as, greylag, geese, in, his, 1935, book, der, kumpan, in, der, umwelt, des, vogels, the, companion, in, the, environment, of, birds, became, the, foundational, description, of, the, phenomenon, here, lorenz, used, jakob, von, uexk, ll, s, concept, of, umwelt, to, understand, how, the, limited, perception, of, animals, filtered, out, certain, phenomena, with, which, they, interacted, instinctively, for, example, a, young, goose, instinctively, bonds, with, the, first, moving, stimulus, it, perceives, whether, it, be, its, mother, or, a, person, lorenz, showed, that, this, behavior, of, imprinting, is, what, allows, the, goose, to, learn, to, recognize, members, of, its, own, species, enabling, them, to, be, the, object, of, subsequent, behavior, patterns, such, as, mating, he, developed, a, theory, of, instinctive, behavior, that, saw, behavior, patterns, as, largely, innate, but, triggered, through, environmental, stimuli, for, example, the, hawk, goose, effect, he, argued, that, animals, have, an, inner, drive, to, carry, out, instinctive, behaviors, and, that, if, they, do, not, encounter, the, right, stimulus, they, will, eventually, engage, in, the, behavior, with, an, inappropriate, stimulus, lorenz, s, approach, to, ethology, derived, from, a, skepticism, towards, the, studies, of, animal, behavior, done, in, laboratory, settings, he, considered, that, in, order, to, understand, the, mechanisms, of, animal, behavior, it, was, necessary, to, observe, their, full, range, of, behaviors, in, their, natural, context, lorenz, did, not, carry, out, much, traditional, fieldwork, but, observed, animals, near, his, home, his, method, involved, empathizing, with, animals, often, using, anthropomorphization, to, imagine, their, mental, states, he, believed, that, animals, were, capable, of, experiencing, many, of, the, same, emotions, as, humans, tinbergen, lorenz, s, friend, with, whom, he, conjointly, received, the, nobel, prize, summarized, lorenz, s, major, contribution, to, ethology, as, making, behavior, a, topic, of, biological, inquiry, considering, behavior, a, part, of, an, animal, s, evolutionary, equipment, tinbergen, and, lorenz, contributed, to, making, ethology, a, recognized, sub, discipline, within, biology, and, founded, the, first, specialized, journal, of, the, field, ethology, originally, zeitschift, f, r, tierpsychologie, lorenz, joined, the, nazi, party, in, 1938, and, accepted, a, university, chair, under, the, nazi, regime, in, his, application, for, party, membership, he, wrote, i, m, able, to, say, that, my, whole, scientific, work, is, devoted, to, the, ideas, of, the, national, socialists, his, publications, during, that, time, led, in, later, years, to, allegations, that, his, scientific, work, had, been, contaminated, by, nazi, sympathies, his, published, writing, during, the, nazi, period, included, support, for, nazi, ideas, of, racial, hygiene, couched, in, pseudoscientific, metaphors, in, his, autobiography, lorenz, wrote, the, same, individual, geese, on, which, we, conducted, these, experiments, first, aroused, my, interest, in, the, process, of, domestication, they, were, f1, hybrids, of, wild, greylags, and, domestic, geese, and, they, showed, surprising, deviations, from, the, normal, social, and, sexual, behaviour, of, the, wild, birds, i, realised, that, an, overpowering, increase, in, the, drives, of, feeding, as, well, as, of, copulation, and, a, waning, of, more, differentiated, social, instincts, is, characteristic, of, very, many, domestic, animals, i, was, frightened, as, i, still, am, by, the, thought, that, analogous, genetical, processes, of, deterioration, may, be, at, work, with, civilized, humanity, moved, by, this, fear, i, did, a, very, ill, advised, thing, soon, after, the, germans, had, invaded, austria, i, wrote, about, the, dangers, of, domestication, and, in, order, to, be, understood, i, couched, my, writing, in, the, worst, of, nazi, terminology, i, do, not, want, to, extenuate, this, action, i, did, indeed, believe, that, some, good, might, come, of, the, new, rulers, the, precedent, narrow, minded, catholic, regime, in, austria, induced, better, and, more, intelligent, men, than, i, was, to, cherish, this, naive, hope, practically, all, my, friends, and, teachers, did, so, including, my, own, father, who, certainly, was, a, kindly, and, humane, man, none, of, us, as, much, as, suspected, that, the, word, selection, when, used, by, these, rulers, meant, murder, i, regret, those, writings, not, so, much, for, the, undeniable, discredit, they, reflect, on, my, person, as, for, their, effect, of, hampering, the, future, recognition, of, the, dangers, of, domestication, after, the, war, lorenz, denied, having, been, a, party, member, until, his, membership, application, was, made, public, and, he, denied, having, known, the, extent, of, the, genocide, despite, his, position, as, a, psychologist, in, the, office, of, racial, policy, he, was, also, shown, to, have, made, anti, semitic, jokes, on, jewish, characteristics, in, letters, to, his, mentor, heinroth, in, 2015, the, university, of, salzburg, posthumously, rescinded, an, honorary, doctorate, awarded, to, lorenz, in, 1983, citing, his, party, membership, and, his, assertions, in, his, application, that, he, was, always, a, national, socialist, and, that, his, work, stands, to, serve, national, socialist, thought, the, university, also, accused, him, of, using, his, work, to, spread, basic, elements, of, the, racist, ideology, of, national, socialism, during, the, final, years, of, his, life, lorenz, supported, the, fledgling, austrian, green, party, and, in, 1984, became, the, figurehead, of, the, konrad, lorenz, volksbegehren, a, grass, roots, movement, that, was, formed, to, prevent, the, building, of, a, power, plant, at, the, danube, near, hainburg, an, der, donau, and, thus, the, destruction, of, the, surrounding, woodland, lorenz, has, been, called, the, father, of, ethology, by, niko, tinbergen, perhaps, lorenz, s, most, important, contribution, to, ethology, was, his, idea, that, behavior, patterns, can, be, studied, as, anatomical, organs, this, concept, forms, the, foundation, of, ethological, research, however, richard, dawkins, called, lorenz, a, good, of, the, species, man, stating, that, the, idea, of, group, selection, was, so, deeply, ingrained, in, lorenz, s, thinking, that, he, evidently, did, not, realize, that, his, statements, contravened, orthodox, darwinian, theory, together, with, nikolaas, tinbergen, lorenz, developed, the, idea, of, an, innate, releasing, mechanism, to, explain, instinctive, behaviors, fixed, action, patterns, they, experimented, with, supernormal, stimuli, such, as, giant, eggs, or, dummy, bird, beaks, which, they, found, could, release, the, fixed, action, patterns, more, powerfully, than, the, natural, objects, for, which, the, behaviors, were, adapted, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, william, mcdougall, lorenz, developed, this, into, a, psychohydraulic, model, of, the, motivation, of, behavior, which, tended, towards, group, selectionist, ideas, which, were, influential, in, the, 1960s, another, of, his, contributions, to, ethology, is, his, work, on, imprinting, his, influence, on, a, younger, generation, of, ethologists, and, his, popular, works, were, important, in, bringing, ethology, to, the, attention, of, the, general, public, lorenz, claimed, that, there, was, widespread, contempt, for, the, descriptive, sciences, he, attributed, this, to, the, denial, of, perception, as, the, source, of, all, scientific, knowledge, a, denial, that, has, been, elevated, to, the, status, of, religion, he, wrote, that, in, comparative, behavioral, research, it, is, necessary, to, describe, various, patterns, of, movement, record, them, and, above, all, render, them, unmistakably, recognizable, there, are, three, research, institutions, named, after, lorenz, in, austria, the, konrad, lorenz, institute, for, evolution, and, cognition, research, kli, was, housed, in, lorenz, family, mansion, at, altenberg, before, moving, to, klosterneuburg, in, 2013, the, konrad, lorenz, forschungsstelle, klf, at, his, former, field, station, in, gr, nau, and, the, konrad, lorenz, institute, of, ethology, an, external, research, facility, of, the, university, of, veterinary, medicine, vienna, lorenz, predicted, the, relationship, between, market, economics, and, the, threat, of, ecological, catastrophe, in, his, 1973, book, civilized, man, s, eight, deadly, sins, lorenz, addresses, the, following, paradox, all, the, advantages, that, man, has, gained, from, his, ever, deepening, understanding, of, the, natural, world, that, surrounds, him, his, technological, chemical, and, medical, progress, all, of, which, should, seem, to, alleviate, human, suffering, tends, instead, to, favor, humanity, s, destruction, lorenz, adopts, an, ecological, model, to, attempt, to, grasp, the, mechanisms, behind, this, contradiction, thus, all, species, are, adapted, to, their, environment, including, not, only, inorganic, components, but, all, the, other, living, beings, that, inhabit, the, locality, p31, fundamental, to, lorenz, s, theory, of, ecology, is, the, function, of, negative, feedback, mechanisms, which, in, hierarchical, fashion, dampen, impulses, that, occur, beneath, a, certain, threshold, the, thresholds, themselves, are, the, product, of, the, interaction, of, contrasting, mechanisms, thus, pain, and, pleasure, act, as, checks, on, each, other, to, gain, a, desired, prey, a, dog, or, wolf, will, do, things, that, in, other, contexts, they, would, shy, away, from, run, through, thorn, bushes, jump, into, cold, water, and, expose, themselves, to, risks, which, would, normally, frighten, them, all, these, inhibitory, mechanisms, act, as, a, counterweight, to, the, effects, of, learning, mechanisms, the, organism, cannot, allow, itself, to, pay, a, price, which, is, not, worth, paying, p53, in, nature, these, mechanisms, tend, towards, a, stable, state, among, the, living, beings, of, an, ecology, a, closer, examination, shows, that, these, beings, not, only, do, not, damage, each, other, but, often, constitute, a, community, of, interests, it, is, obvious, that, the, predator, is, strongly, interested, in, the, survival, of, that, species, animal, or, vegetable, which, constitutes, its, prey, it, is, not, uncommon, that, the, prey, species, derives, specific, benefits, from, its, interaction, with, the, predator, species, pp31, 33, lorenz, states, that, humanity, is, the, one, species, not, bound, by, these, mechanisms, being, the, only, one, that, has, defined, its, own, environment, is, determined, by, the, progress, of, man, s, technology, p35, human, ecology, economy, is, governed, by, mechanisms, of, positive, feedback, defined, as, a, mechanism, which, tends, to, encourage, behavior, rather, than, to, attenuate, it, p43, positive, feedback, always, involves, the, danger, of, an, avalanche, effect, one, particular, kind, of, positive, feedback, occurs, when, individuals, of, the, same, species, enter, into, competition, among, themselves, for, many, animal, species, environmental, factors, keep, intraspecies, selection, from, disaster, but, there, is, no, force, which, exercises, this, type, of, healthy, regulatory, effect, on, humanity, s, cultural, development, unfortunately, for, itself, humanity, has, learned, to, overcome, all, those, environmental, forces, which, are, external, to, itself, p44, regarding, aggression, in, human, beings, lorenz, states, let, us, imagine, that, an, absolutely, unbiased, investigator, on, another, planet, perhaps, on, mars, is, examining, human, behavior, on, earth, with, the, aid, of, a, telescope, whose, magnification, is, too, small, to, enable, him, to, discern, individuals, and, follow, their, separate, behavior, but, large, enough, for, him, to, observe, occurrences, such, as, migrations, of, peoples, wars, and, similar, great, historical, events, he, would, never, gain, the, impression, that, human, behavior, was, dictated, by, intelligence, still, less, by, responsible, morality, if, we, suppose, our, extraneous, observer, to, be, a, being, of, pure, reason, devoid, of, instincts, himself, and, unaware, of, the, way, in, which, all, instincts, in, general, and, aggression, in, particular, can, miscarry, he, would, be, at, a, complete, loss, how, to, explain, history, at, all, the, ever, recurrent, phenomena, of, history, do, not, have, reasonable, causes, it, is, a, mere, commonplace, to, say, that, they, are, caused, by, what, common, parlance, so, aptly, terms, human, nature, unreasoning, and, unreasonable, human, nature, causes, two, nations, to, compete, though, no, economic, necessity, compels, them, to, do, so, it, induces, two, political, parties, or, religions, with, amazingly, similar, programs, of, salvation, to, fight, each, other, bitterly, and, it, impels, an, alexander, or, a, napoleon, to, sacrifice, millions, of, lives, in, his, attempt, to, unite, the, world, under, his, scepter, we, have, been, taught, to, regard, some, of, the, persons, who, have, committed, these, and, similar, absurdities, with, respect, even, as, great, men, we, are, wont, to, yield, to, the, political, wisdom, of, those, in, charge, and, we, are, all, so, accustomed, to, these, phenomena, that, most, of, us, fail, to, realize, how, abjectly, stupid, and, undesirable, the, historical, mass, behavior, of, humanity, actually, is, lorenz, does, not, see, human, independence, from, natural, ecological, processes, as, necessarily, bad, he, states, that, a, completely, new, which, corresponds, in, every, way, to, desires, could, theoretically, prove, as, durable, as, that, which, would, have, existed, without, his, intervention, 36, however, the, principle, of, competition, typical, of, western, societies, destroys, any, chance, of, this, the, competition, between, human, beings, destroys, with, cold, and, diabolic, brutality, under, the, pressure, of, this, competitive, fury, we, have, not, only, forgotten, what, is, useful, to, humanity, as, a, whole, but, even, that, which, is, good, and, advantageous, to, the, individual, one, asks, which, is, more, damaging, to, modern, humanity, the, thirst, for, money, or, consuming, haste, in, either, case, fear, plays, a, very, important, role, the, fear, of, being, overtaken, by, one, s, competitors, the, fear, of, becoming, poor, the, fear, of, making, wrong, decisions, or, the, fear, of, not, being, up, to, snuff, pp, 45, 47, in, his, 1973, book, behind, the, mirror, a, search, for, a, natural, history, of, human, knowledge, lorenz, considers, the, old, philosophical, question, of, whether, our, senses, correctly, inform, us, about, the, world, as, it, is, or, provide, us, only, with, an, illusion, his, answer, comes, from, evolutionary, biology, only, traits, that, help, us, survive, and, reproduce, are, transmitted, if, our, senses, gave, us, wrong, information, about, our, environment, we, would, soon, be, extinct, therefore, we, can, be, sure, that, our, senses, give, us, correct, information, for, otherwise, we, would, not, be, here, to, be, deceived, lorenz, s, best, known, books, are, king, solomon, s, ring, and, on, aggression, both, written, for, a, popular, audience, his, scientific, work, appeared, mainly, in, journal, articles, written, in, german, it, became, widely, known, to, english, speaking, scientists, through, its, description, in, tinbergen, s, 1951, book, the, study, of, instinct, though, many, of, his, papers, were, later, published, in, english, translation, in, the, two, volumes, titled, studies, in, animal, and, human, behavior, konrad, adolf, lorenz, museum, kalm, https, www, kalm, at
