throughout, the, summer, of, 1806, the, cause, of, the, incident, was, selim, iii, s, attempt, to, expand, the, new, order, s, permanent, presence, into, rumelia, by, establishing, new, order, barracks, in, the, region, s, cities, the, outcome, of, the, confrontation, was, the, retreat, of, imperial, forces, to, istanbul, and, anatolia, which, constituted, a, death, blow, to, selim, iii, s,
