eratosthenes, of, cyrene, r, t, s, n, i, z, greek, c, 276, bc, c, 195, 194, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, polymath, a, mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and, music, theorist, he, was, a, man, of, learning, becoming, the, chief, librarian, at, the, library, of, alexandria, his, work, is, comparable, to, what, is, now, known, as, the, study, of, geography, and, he, introduced, some, of, the, terminology, still, used, today, he, is, best, known, for, being, the, first, person, known, to, calculate, the, circumference, of, the, earth, which, he, did, by, using, the, extensive, survey, results, he, could, access, in, his, role, at, the, library, his, calculation, was, remarkably, accurate, his, error, margin, turned, out, to, be, less, than, 1, he, was, also, the, first, to, calculate, earth, s, axial, tilt, which, has, also, proved, to, have, remarkable, accuracy, he, created, the, first, global, projection, of, the, world, incorporating, parallels, and, meridians, based, on, the, available, geographic, knowledge, of, his, era, eratosthenes, was, the, founder, of, scientific, chronology, he, used, egyptian, and, persian, records, to, estimate, the, dates, of, the, main, events, of, the, trojan, war, dating, the, sack, of, troy, to, 1183, bc, in, number, theory, he, introduced, the, sieve, of, eratosthenes, an, efficient, method, of, identifying, prime, numbers, and, composite, numbers, he, was, a, figure, of, influence, in, many, fields, who, yearned, to, understand, the, complexities, of, the, entire, world, his, devotees, nicknamed, him, pentathlos, after, the, olympians, who, were, well, rounded, competitors, for, he, had, proven, himself, to, be, knowledgeable, in, every, area, of, learning, yet, according, to, an, entry, in, the, suda, a, 10th, century, encyclopedia, some, critics, scorned, him, calling, him, number, 2, because, he, always, came, in, second, in, all, his, endeavours, the, son, of, aglaos, eratosthenes, was, born, in, 276, bc, in, cyrene, now, part, of, modern, day, libya, cyrene, had, been, founded, by, greeks, centuries, earlier, and, became, the, capital, of, pentapolis, north, africa, a, country, of, five, cities, cyrene, arsinoe, berenice, ptolemias, and, apollonia, alexander, the, great, conquered, cyrene, in, 332, bc, and, following, his, death, in, 323, bc, its, rule, was, given, to, one, of, his, generals, ptolemy, i, soter, the, founder, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, under, ptolemaic, rule, the, economy, prospered, based, largely, on, the, export, of, horses, and, silphium, a, plant, used, for, rich, seasoning, and, medicine, cyrene, became, a, place, of, cultivation, where, knowledge, blossomed, like, any, young, greek, at, the, time, eratosthenes, would, have, studied, in, the, local, gymnasium, where, he, would, have, learned, physical, skills, and, social, discourse, as, well, as, reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and, music, eratosthenes, went, to, athens, to, further, his, studies, there, he, was, taught, stoicism, by, its, founder, zeno, of, citium, in, philosophical, lectures, on, living, a, virtuous, life, he, then, studied, under, aristo, of, chios, who, led, a, more, cynical, school, of, philosophy, he, also, studied, under, the, head, of, the, platonic, academy, who, was, arcesilaus, of, pitane, his, interest, in, plato, led, him, to, write, his, first, work, at, a, scholarly, level, platonikos, inquiring, into, the, mathematical, foundation, of, plato, s, philosophies, eratosthenes, was, a, man, of, many, perspectives, and, investigated, the, art, of, poetry, under, callimachus, he, wrote, poems, one, in, hexameters, called, hermes, illustrating, the, god, s, life, history, and, another, in, elegiacs, called, erigone, describing, the, suicide, of, the, athenian, maiden, erigone, daughter, of, icarius, he, wrote, chronographies, a, text, that, scientifically, depicted, dates, of, importance, beginning, with, the, trojan, war, this, work, was, highly, esteemed, for, its, accuracy, george, syncellus, was, later, able, to, preserve, from, chronographies, a, list, of, 38, kings, of, the, egyptian, thebes, eratosthenes, also, wrote, olympic, victors, a, chronology, of, the, winners, of, the, olympic, games, it, is, not, known, when, he, wrote, his, works, but, they, highlighted, his, abilities, these, works, and, his, great, poetic, abilities, led, the, king, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, to, seek, to, place, him, as, a, librarian, at, the, library, of, alexandria, in, the, year, 245, bc, eratosthenes, then, thirty, years, old, accepted, ptolemy, s, invitation, and, traveled, to, alexandria, where, he, lived, for, the, rest, of, his, life, within, about, fifty, years, he, became, chief, librarian, a, position, that, the, poet, apollonius, rhodius, had, previously, held, as, head, of, the, library, eratosthenes, tutored, the, children, of, ptolemy, including, ptolemy, iv, philopator, who, became, the, fourth, ptolemaic, pharaoh, he, expanded, the, library, s, holdings, in, alexandria, all, books, had, to, be, surrendered, for, duplication, it, was, said, that, these, were, copied, so, accurately, that, it, was, impossible, to, tell, if, the, library, had, returned, the, original, or, the, copy, he, sought, to, maintain, the, reputation, of, the, library, of, alexandria, against, competition, from, the, library, of, pergamum, eratosthenes, created, a, whole, section, devoted, to, the, examination, of, homer, and, acquired, original, works, of, great, tragic, dramas, of, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, eratosthenes, made, several, important, contributions, to, mathematics, and, science, and, was, a, friend, of, archimedes, around, 255, bc, he, invented, the, armillary, sphere, in, on, the, circular, motions, of, the, celestial, bodies, cleomedes, credited, him, with, having, calculated, the, earth, s, circumference, around, 240, bc, with, high, accuracy, eratosthenes, believed, there, was, both, good, and, bad, in, every, nation, and, criticized, aristotle, for, arguing, that, humanity, was, divided, into, greeks, and, barbarians, as, well, as, for, arguing, that, the, greeks, should, keep, themselves, racially, pure, as, he, aged, he, contracted, ophthalmia, becoming, blind, around, 195, bc, losing, the, ability, to, read, and, to, observe, nature, plagued, and, depressed, him, leading, him, to, voluntarily, starve, himself, to, death, he, died, in, 194, bc, at, the, age, of, 82, in, alexandria, the, measurement, of, earth, s, circumference, is, the, most, famous, among, the, results, obtained, by, eratosthenes, who, estimated, that, the, meridian, has, a, length, of, 252, 000, stadia, 39, 060, to, 40, 320, kilometres, 24, 270, to, 25, 050, mi, with, an, error, on, the, real, value, between, 2, 4, and, 0, 8, assuming, a, value, for, the, stadion, between, 155, and, 160, metres, 509, and, 525, ft, eratosthenes, described, his, arc, measurement, technique, in, a, book, entitled, on, the, measure, of, the, earth, which, has, not, been, preserved, however, a, simplified, version, of, the, method, has, been, preserved, as, described, by, cleomedes, the, simplified, method, works, by, considering, two, cities, along, the, same, meridian, and, measuring, both, the, distance, between, them, and, the, difference, in, angles, of, the, shadows, cast, by, the, sun, on, a, vertical, rod, a, gnomon, in, each, city, at, noon, on, the, summer, solstice, the, two, cities, used, were, alexandria, and, syene, modern, aswan, and, the, distance, between, the, cities, was, measured, by, professional, bematists, a, geometric, calculation, reveals, that, the, circumference, of, the, earth, is, the, distance, between, the, two, cities, divided, by, the, difference, in, shadow, angles, expressed, as, a, fraction, of, one, turn, eratosthenes, now, continued, from, his, knowledge, about, the, earth, using, his, discoveries, and, knowledge, of, its, size, and, shape, he, began, to, sketch, it, in, the, library, of, alexandria, he, had, access, to, various, travel, books, which, contained, various, items, of, information, and, representations, of, the, world, that, needed, to, be, pieced, together, in, some, organized, format, in, his, three, volume, work, geography, greek, geographika, he, described, and, mapped, his, entire, known, world, even, dividing, the, earth, into, five, climate, zones, two, freezing, zones, around, the, poles, two, temperate, zones, and, a, zone, encompassing, the, equator, and, the, tropics, this, book, is, the, first, recorded, instance, of, many, terms, still, in, use, today, including, the, name, of, the, discipline, geography, he, placed, grids, of, overlapping, lines, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, he, used, parallels, and, meridians, to, link, together, every, place, in, the, world, it, was, now, possible, to, estimate, one, s, distance, from, remote, locations, with, this, network, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, in, the, geography, the, names, of, over, 400, cities, and, their, locations, were, shown, which, had, never, been, achieved, before, however, his, geography, has, been, lost, to, history, although, fragments, of, the, work, can, be, pieced, together, from, other, great, historians, like, pliny, polybius, strabo, and, marcianus, while, this, work, is, the, earliest, we, can, trace, certain, ideas, words, and, concepts, in, the, historical, record, earlier, contributions, may, have, been, lost, to, history, according, to, strabo, eratosthenes, argued, against, the, greek, barbarian, dichotomy, he, says, alexander, ignored, his, advisers, by, his, regard, for, all, people, with, law, and, government, strabo, says, that, eratosthenes, was, wrong, to, claim, that, alexander, had, disregarded, the, counsel, of, his, advisers, strabo, argues, it, was, alexander, s, interpretation, of, their, real, intent, in, recognizing, that, in, some, people, there, prevail, the, law, abiding, and, the, political, instinct, and, the, qualities, associated, with, education, and, powers, of, speech, eratosthenes, was, described, by, the, suda, lexicon, as, a, pentathlos, which, can, be, translated, as, all, rounded, for, he, was, skilled, in, a, variety, of, things, he, was, a, true, polymath, his, opponents, nicknamed, him, number, 2, because, he, was, great, at, many, things, and, tried, to, get, his, hands, on, every, bit, of, information, but, never, achieved, the, highest, rank, in, anything, strabo, accounts, eratosthenes, as, a, mathematician, among, geographers, and, a, geographer, among, mathematicians, eratosthenes, proposed, a, simple, algorithm, for, finding, prime, numbers, this, algorithm, is, known, in, mathematics, as, the, sieve, of, eratosthenes, in, mathematics, the, sieve, of, eratosthenes, greek, one, of, a, number, of, prime, number, sieves, is, a, simple, ancient, algorithm, for, finding, all, prime, numbers, up, to, any, given, limit, it, does, so, by, iteratively, marking, as, composite, i, e, not, prime, the, multiples, of, each, prime, starting, with, the, multiples, of, 2, the, multiples, of, a, given, prime, are, generated, starting, from, that, prime, as, a, sequence, of, numbers, with, the, same, difference, equal, to, that, prime, between, consecutive, numbers, this, is, the, sieve, s, key, distinction, from, using, trial, division, to, sequentially, test, each, candidate, number, for, divisibility, by, each, prime, eratosthenes, was, one, of, the, most, pre, eminent, scholarly, figures, of, his, time, and, produced, works, covering, a, vast, area, of, knowledge, before, and, during, his, time, at, the, library, he, wrote, on, many, topics, geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary, criticism, grammar, poetry, and, even, old, comedies, there, are, no, documents, left, of, his, work, after, the, destruction, of, the, library, of, alexandria
