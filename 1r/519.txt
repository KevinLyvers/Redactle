glenn, herbert, gould, u, l, d, n, gold, 25, september, 1932, 4, october, 1982, was, a, canadian, classical, pianist, he, was, among, the, most, famous, and, celebrated, pianists, of, the, 20th, century, renowned, as, an, interpreter, of, the, keyboard, works, of, johann, sebastian, bach, his, playing, was, distinguished, by, remarkable, technical, proficiency, and, a, capacity, to, articulate, the, contrapuntal, texture, of, bach, s, music, gould, rejected, most, of, the, romantic, piano, literature, by, chopin, liszt, rachmaninoff, and, others, in, favour, of, bach, and, beethoven, mainly, along, with, some, late, romantic, and, modernist, composers, gould, also, recorded, works, by, mozart, haydn, scriabin, and, brahms, pre, baroque, composers, such, as, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, william, byrd, and, orlando, gibbons, and, 20th, century, composers, including, paul, hindemith, arnold, schoenberg, and, richard, strauss, gould, was, also, a, writer, and, broadcaster, and, dabbled, in, composing, and, conducting, he, produced, television, programmes, about, classical, music, in, which, he, would, speak, and, perform, or, interact, with, an, interviewer, in, a, scripted, manner, he, made, three, musique, concr, te, radio, documentaries, collectively, the, solitude, trilogy, about, isolated, areas, of, canada, he, was, a, prolific, contributor, to, music, journals, in, which, he, discussed, music, theory, gould, was, known, for, his, eccentricities, ranging, from, his, unorthodox, musical, interpretations, and, mannerisms, at, the, keyboard, to, aspects, of, his, lifestyle, and, behaviour, he, disliked, public, performance, and, stopped, giving, concerts, at, age, 31, to, concentrate, on, studio, recording, and, media, glenn, gould, was, born, at, home, at, 32, southwood, drive, in, the, beaches, toronto, on, september, 25, 1932, the, only, child, of, russell, herbert, gold, and, florence, emma, gold, n, e, greig, presbyterians, of, scottish, english, and, norwegian, ancestry, the, family, s, surname, was, informally, changed, to, gould, around, 1939, to, avoid, being, mistaken, for, jewish, given, the, prevailing, antisemitism, of, prewar, toronto, gould, had, no, jewish, ancestry, though, he, sometimes, joked, about, it, saying, when, people, ask, me, if, i, m, jewish, i, always, tell, them, that, i, was, jewish, during, the, war, his, interest, in, music, and, his, talent, as, a, pianist, were, evident, very, early, both, parents, were, musical, his, mother, especially, encouraged, his, musical, development, from, infancy, hoping, he, would, become, a, successful, musician, she, exposed, him, to, music, during, her, pregnancy, she, taught, him, the, piano, and, as, a, baby, he, reportedly, hummed, instead, of, crying, and, wiggled, his, fingers, as, if, playing, a, keyboard, instrument, leading, his, doctor, to, predict, that, he, would, be, either, a, physician, or, a, pianist, he, learned, to, read, music, before, he, could, read, words, and, it, was, observed, that, he, had, perfect, pitch, at, age, three, when, presented, with, a, piano, the, young, gould, was, reported, to, strike, single, notes, and, listen, to, their, long, decay, a, practice, his, father, bert, noted, was, different, from, typical, children, gould, s, interest, in, the, piano, was, concomitant, with, an, interest, in, composition, he, played, his, pieces, for, family, friends, and, sometimes, large, gatherings, including, in, 1938, a, performance, at, the, emmanuel, presbyterian, church, a, few, blocks, from, the, gould, family, home, of, one, of, his, compositions, gould, first, heard, a, live, musical, performance, by, a, celebrated, soloist, at, age, six, this, profoundly, affected, him, he, later, described, the, experience, it, was, hofmann, it, was, i, think, his, last, performance, in, toronto, and, it, was, a, staggering, impression, the, only, thing, i, can, really, remember, is, that, when, i, was, being, brought, home, in, a, car, i, was, in, that, wonderful, state, of, half, awakeness, in, which, you, hear, all, sorts, of, incredible, sounds, going, through, your, mind, they, were, all, orchestral, sounds, but, i, was, playing, them, all, and, suddenly, i, was, hofmann, i, was, enchanted, at, age, 10, he, began, attending, the, toronto, conservatory, of, music, in, toronto, known, since, 1947, as, the, royal, conservatory, of, music, he, studied, music, theory, with, leo, smith, organ, with, frederick, c, silvester, and, piano, with, alberto, guerrero, around, the, same, time, he, injured, his, back, as, a, result, of, a, fall, from, a, boat, ramp, on, the, shore, of, lake, simcoe, this, incident, is, apocryphally, related, to, the, adjustable, height, chair, his, father, made, shortly, thereafter, gould, s, mother, would, urge, the, young, gould, to, sit, up, straight, at, the, keyboard, he, used, this, chair, for, the, rest, of, his, life, taking, it, with, him, almost, everywhere, the, chair, was, designed, so, that, gould, could, sit, very, low, and, allowed, him, to, pull, down, on, the, keys, rather, than, striking, them, from, above, a, central, technical, idea, of, guerrero, s, gould, developed, a, technique, that, enabled, him, to, choose, a, very, fast, tempo, while, retaining, the, separateness, and, clarity, of, each, note, his, extremely, low, position, at, the, instrument, permitted, him, more, control, over, the, keyboard, gould, showed, considerable, technical, skill, in, performing, and, recording, a, wide, repertoire, including, virtuosic, and, romantic, works, such, as, his, own, arrangement, of, ravel, s, la, valse, and, liszt, s, transcriptions, of, beethoven, s, fifth, and, sixth, symphonies, gould, worked, from, a, young, age, with, guerrero, on, a, technique, known, as, finger, tapping, a, method, of, training, the, fingers, to, act, more, independently, from, the, arm, gould, passed, his, final, conservatory, examination, in, piano, at, age, 12, achieving, the, highest, marks, of, any, candidate, and, thus, attaining, professional, standing, as, a, pianist, one, year, later, he, passed, the, written, theory, exams, qualifying, for, an, associate, of, the, toronto, conservatory, of, music, atcm, diploma, gould, was, a, child, prodigy, and, was, described, in, adulthood, as, a, musical, phenomenon, he, claimed, to, have, almost, never, practiced, on, the, piano, itself, preferring, to, study, repertoire, by, reading, another, technique, he, had, learned, from, guerrero, he, may, have, spoken, ironically, about, his, practising, though, as, there, is, evidence, that, on, occasion, he, did, practise, quite, hard, sometimes, using, his, own, drills, and, techniques, he, seemed, able, to, practise, mentally, once, preparing, for, a, recording, of, brahms, s, piano, works, without, playing, them, until, a, few, weeks, before, the, sessions, gould, could, play, a, vast, repertoire, of, piano, music, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, orchestral, and, operatic, transcriptions, from, memory, he, could, memorize, at, sight, and, once, challenged, a, friend, to, name, any, piece, of, music, that, he, could, not, instantly, play, from, memory, the, piano, gould, said, is, not, an, instrument, for, which, i, have, any, great, love, as, such, i, have, played, it, all, my, life, and, it, is, the, best, vehicle, i, have, to, express, my, ideas, in, the, case, of, bach, gould, noted, fixed, the, action, in, some, of, the, instruments, i, play, on, and, the, piano, i, use, for, all, recordings, is, now, so, fixed, so, that, it, is, a, shallower, and, more, responsive, action, than, the, standard, it, tends, to, have, a, mechanism, which, is, rather, like, an, automobile, without, power, steering, you, are, in, control, and, not, it, it, doesn, t, drive, you, you, drive, it, this, is, the, secret, of, doing, bach, on, the, piano, at, all, you, must, have, that, immediacy, of, response, that, control, over, fine, definitions, of, things, as, a, teenager, gould, was, significantly, influenced, by, artur, schnabel, and, rosalyn, tureck, s, recordings, of, bach, which, he, called, upright, with, a, sense, of, repose, and, positiveness, and, the, conductor, leopold, stokowski, gould, was, known, for, his, vivid, imagination, listeners, regarded, his, interpretations, as, ranging, from, brilliantly, creative, to, outright, eccentric, his, pianism, had, great, clarity, and, erudition, particularly, in, contrapuntal, passages, and, extraordinary, control, gould, believed, the, piano, to, be, a, contrapuntal, instrument, and, his, whole, approach, to, music, was, centered, in, the, baroque, much, of, the, homophony, that, followed, he, felt, belongs, to, a, less, serious, and, less, spiritual, period, of, art, gould, had, a, pronounced, aversion, to, what, he, termed, hedonistic, approaches, to, piano, repertoire, performance, and, music, generally, for, him, hedonism, in, this, sense, denoted, a, superficial, theatricality, something, to, which, he, felt, mozart, for, example, became, increasingly, susceptible, later, in, his, career, he, associated, this, drift, toward, hedonism, with, the, emergence, of, a, cult, of, showmanship, and, gratuitous, virtuosity, on, the, concert, platform, in, the, 19th, century, and, later, the, institution, of, the, public, concert, he, felt, degenerated, into, the, blood, sport, with, which, he, struggled, and, which, he, ultimately, rejected, on, 5, june, 1938, at, age, five, gould, played, in, public, for, the, first, time, joining, his, family, on, stage, to, play, piano, at, a, church, service, at, the, business, men, s, bible, class, in, uxbridge, ontario, in, front, of, a, congregation, of, about, 2, 000, in, 1945, at, 13, he, made, his, first, appearance, with, an, orchestra, in, a, performance, of, the, first, movement, of, beethoven, s, 4th, piano, concerto, with, the, toronto, symphony, his, first, solo, concert, followed, in, 1947, and, his, first, recital, on, radio, was, with, the, cbc, in, 1950, this, was, the, beginning, of, gould, s, long, association, with, radio, and, recording, he, founded, the, festival, trio, chamber, group, in, 1953, with, cellist, isaac, mamott, and, violinist, albert, pratz, gould, made, his, american, debut, on, 2, january, 1955, in, washington, d, c, at, the, phillips, collection, the, music, critic, paul, hume, wrote, in, the, washington, post, january, 2, is, early, for, predictions, but, it, is, unlikely, that, the, year, 1955, will, bring, us, a, finer, piano, recital, than, that, played, yesterday, afternoon, in, the, phillips, gallery, we, shall, be, lucky, if, it, brings, us, others, of, equal, beauty, and, significance, a, performance, at, the, town, hall, in, new, york, city, followed, on, 11, january, gould, s, reputation, quickly, grew, in, 1957, he, undertook, a, tour, of, the, soviet, union, becoming, the, first, north, american, to, play, there, since, world, war, ii, his, concerts, featured, bach, beethoven, and, the, serial, music, of, schoenberg, and, berg, which, had, been, suppressed, in, the, soviet, union, during, the, era, of, socialist, realism, gould, debuted, in, boston, in, 1958, playing, for, the, peabody, mason, concert, series, on, 31, january, 1960, gould, first, appeared, on, american, television, on, cbs, s, ford, presents, series, performing, bach, s, keyboard, concerto, no, 1, in, d, minor, bwv, 1052, with, leonard, bernstein, conducting, the, new, york, philharmonic, gould, believed, that, the, institution, of, the, public, concert, was, an, anachronism, and, a, force, of, evil, leading, to, his, early, retirement, from, concert, performance, he, argued, that, public, performance, devolved, into, a, sort, of, competition, with, a, non, empathetic, audience, mostly, attendant, to, the, possibility, of, the, performer, erring, or, failing, critical, expectation, and, that, such, performances, produced, unexceptional, interpretations, because, of, the, limitations, of, live, music, he, set, forth, this, doctrine, half, in, jest, in, gpaadak, the, gould, plan, for, the, abolition, of, applause, and, demonstrations, of, all, kinds, on, 10, april, 1964, he, gave, his, last, public, performance, at, los, angeles, s, wilshire, ebell, theater, among, the, pieces, he, performed, were, beethoven, s, piano, sonata, no, 30, selections, from, bach, s, the, art, of, fugue, and, hindemith, s, piano, sonata, no, 3, gould, performed, fewer, than, 200, concerts, of, which, fewer, than, 40, were, outside, canada, for, a, pianist, such, as, van, cliburn, 200, concerts, would, have, amounted, to, about, two, years, touring, one, of, gould, s, reasons, for, abandoning, live, performance, was, his, aesthetic, preference, for, the, recording, studio, where, in, his, words, he, developed, a, love, affair, with, the, microphone, there, he, could, control, every, aspect, of, the, final, musical, product, by, selecting, parts, of, various, takes, he, felt, that, he, could, realize, a, musical, score, more, fully, this, way, gould, felt, strongly, that, there, was, little, point, in, re, recording, centuries, old, pieces, if, the, performer, had, no, new, perspective, to, bring, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, eschewed, live, performance, focusing, instead, on, recording, writing, and, broadcasting, gould, was, widely, known, for, his, unusual, habits, he, often, hummed, or, sang, while, he, played, and, his, audio, engineers, were, not, always, able, to, exclude, his, voice, from, recordings, gould, claimed, that, his, singing, was, unconscious, and, increased, in, proportion, to, his, inability, to, produce, his, intended, interpretation, on, a, given, piano, it, is, likely, that, the, habit, originated, in, his, having, been, taught, by, his, mother, to, sing, everything, that, he, played, as, his, biographer, kevin, bazzana, wrote, this, became, an, unbreakable, and, notorious, habit, some, of, gould, s, recordings, were, severely, criticised, because, of, this, background, vocalising, for, example, a, reviewer, of, his, 1981, rerecording, of, the, goldberg, variations, wrote, that, many, listeners, would, find, the, groans, and, croons, intolerable, gould, was, known, for, his, peculiar, even, theatrical, gesticulations, while, playing, another, oddity, was, his, insistence, on, absolute, control, over, every, aspect, of, his, environment, the, temperature, of, the, recording, studio, had, to, be, precisely, regulated, he, invariably, insisted, that, it, be, extremely, warm, according, to, another, of, gould, s, biographers, otto, friedrich, the, air, conditioning, engineer, had, to, work, just, as, hard, as, the, recording, engineers, the, piano, had, to, be, set, at, a, certain, height, and, would, be, raised, on, wooden, blocks, if, necessary, a, rug, would, sometimes, be, required, for, his, feet, he, had, to, sit, exactly, 14, inches, 360, mm, above, the, floor, and, would, play, concerts, only, with, the, chair, his, father, had, made, he, used, this, chair, even, when, the, seat, was, completely, worn, his, chair, is, so, closely, identified, with, him, that, it, is, shown, in, a, place, of, honour, in, a, glass, case, at, library, and, archives, canada, conductors, had, mixed, responses, to, gould, and, his, playing, habits, george, szell, who, led, gould, in, 1957, with, the, cleveland, orchestra, remarked, to, his, assistant, that, nut, s, a, genius, bernstein, said, there, is, nobody, quite, like, him, and, i, just, love, playing, with, him, bernstein, created, a, stir, at, the, concert, of, april, 6, 1962, when, just, before, the, new, york, philharmonic, was, to, perform, the, brahms, piano, concerto, no, 1, in, d, minor, with, gould, he, informed, the, audience, that, he, was, assuming, no, responsibility, for, what, they, were, about, to, hear, he, asked, the, audience, in, a, concerto, who, is, the, boss, the, soloist, or, the, conductor, to, which, the, audience, laughed, the, answer, is, of, course, sometimes, the, one, and, sometimes, the, other, depending, on, the, people, involved, specifically, bernstein, was, referring, to, their, rehearsals, with, gould, s, insistence, that, the, entire, first, movement, be, played, at, half, the, indicated, tempo, the, speech, was, interpreted, by, harold, c, schonberg, music, critic, for, the, new, york, times, as, an, abdication, of, responsibility, and, an, attack, on, gould, plans, for, a, studio, recording, of, the, performance, came, to, nothing, the, live, radio, broadcast, was, subsequently, released, on, cd, bernstein, s, disclaimer, included, gould, was, averse, to, cold, and, wore, heavy, clothing, including, gloves, even, in, warm, places, he, was, once, arrested, possibly, being, mistaken, for, a, vagrant, while, sitting, on, a, park, bench, in, sarasota, florida, dressed, in, his, standard, all, climate, attire, of, coat, hat, and, mittens, he, also, disliked, social, functions, he, hated, being, touched, and, in, later, life, limited, personal, contact, relying, on, the, telephone, and, letters, for, communication, on, a, visit, to, steinway, hall, in, new, york, city, in, 1959, the, chief, piano, technician, at, the, time, william, hupfer, greeted, gould, with, a, slap, on, the, back, gould, was, shocked, by, this, and, complained, of, aching, lack, of, coordination, and, fatigue, because, of, it, he, went, on, to, explore, the, possibility, of, litigation, against, steinway, sons, if, his, apparent, injuries, were, permanent, he, was, known, for, cancelling, performances, at, the, last, minute, which, is, why, bernstein, s, aforementioned, public, disclaimer, opened, with, don, t, be, frightened, mr, gould, is, here, will, appear, in, a, moment, in, his, liner, notes, and, broadcasts, gould, created, more, than, two, dozen, alter, egos, for, satirical, humorous, and, didactic, purposes, permitting, him, to, write, hostile, reviews, or, incomprehensible, commentaries, on, his, own, performances, probably, the, best, known, are, the, german, musicologist, karlheinz, klopweisser, the, english, conductor, sir, nigel, twitt, thornwaite, and, the, american, critic, theodore, slutz, these, facets, of, gould, whether, interpreted, as, neurosis, or, play, have, provided, ample, material, for, psychobiography, gould, was, a, teetotaller, and, did, not, smoke, he, did, not, cook, instead, he, often, ate, at, restaurants, and, relied, on, room, service, he, ate, one, meal, a, day, supplemented, by, arrowroot, biscuits, and, coffee, in, his, later, years, he, claimed, to, be, vegetarian, though, this, is, not, certain, gould, lived, a, private, life, the, documentary, filmmaker, bruno, monsaingeon, said, of, him, no, supreme, pianist, has, ever, given, of, his, heart, and, mind, so, overwhelmingly, while, showing, himself, so, sparingly, he, never, married, and, biographers, have, spent, considerable, time, on, his, sexuality, bazzana, writes, that, it, is, tempting, to, assume, that, gould, was, asexual, an, image, that, certainly, fits, his, aesthetic, and, the, persona, he, sought, to, convey, and, one, can, read, the, whole, gould, literature, and, be, convinced, that, he, died, a, virgin, but, he, also, mentions, that, evidence, points, to, a, number, of, relationships, with, women, that, may, or, may, not, have, been, platonic, and, ultimately, became, complicated, and, were, ended, one, piece, of, evidence, arrived, in, 2007, when, gould, was, in, los, angeles, in, 1956, he, met, cornelia, foss, an, art, instructor, and, her, husband, lukas, a, conductor, after, several, years, she, and, gould, became, lovers, in, 1967, she, left, her, husband, for, gould, taking, her, two, children, with, her, to, toronto, she, purchased, a, house, near, gould, s, apartment, in, 2007, foss, confirmed, that, she, and, gould, had, had, a, love, affair, for, several, years, according, to, her, there, were, a, lot, of, misconceptions, about, glenn, and, it, was, partly, because, he, was, so, very, private, but, i, assure, you, he, was, an, extremely, heterosexual, man, our, relationship, was, among, other, things, quite, sexual, their, affair, lasted, until, 1972, when, she, returned, to, her, husband, as, early, as, two, weeks, after, leaving, her, husband, foss, noticed, disturbing, signs, in, gould, alluding, to, unusual, behaviour, that, was, more, than, just, neurotic, specifically, he, believed, that, someone, was, spying, on, him, according, to, foss, s, son, though, an, admitted, hypochondriac, gould, had, many, pains, and, ailments, but, his, autopsy, revealed, few, underlying, problems, in, areas, that, often, troubled, him, he, worried, about, everything, from, high, blood, pressure, which, in, his, later, years, he, recorded, in, diary, form, to, the, safety, of, his, hands, gould, rarely, shook, people, s, hands, and, habitually, wore, gloves, the, spine, injury, he, experienced, as, a, child, led, physicians, to, prescribe, usually, independently, an, assortment, of, analgesics, anxiolytics, and, other, drugs, bazzana, has, speculated, that, gould, s, increasing, use, of, a, variety, of, prescription, medications, over, his, career, may, have, had, a, deleterious, effect, on, his, health, it, had, reached, the, stage, bazzana, writes, that, he, was, taking, pills, to, counteract, the, side, effects, of, other, pills, creating, a, cycle, of, dependency, in, 1956, gould, told, photojournalist, jock, carroll, about, my, hysteria, about, eating, it, s, getting, worse, all, the, time, in, his, biography, psychiatrist, peter, f, ostwald, noted, gould, s, increasing, neurosis, about, food, in, the, mid, 1950s, something, gould, had, spoken, to, him, about, ostwald, later, discussed, the, possibility, that, gould, had, developed, a, psychogenic, eating, disorder, around, this, time, in, 1956, gould, was, also, taking, thorazine, an, anti, psychotic, medication, and, reserpine, another, anti, psychotic, which, can, also, be, used, to, lower, blood, pressure, cornelia, foss, has, said, that, gould, took, many, antidepressants, which, she, blamed, for, his, deteriorating, mental, state, whether, gould, s, behaviour, fell, within, the, autism, spectrum, has, been, debated, the, diagnosis, was, first, suggested, by, psychiatrist, peter, ostwald, a, friend, of, gould, s, in, the, 1997, book, glenn, gould, the, ecstasy, and, tragedy, of, genius, there, has, also, been, speculation, that, he, may, have, had, bipolar, disorder, because, he, sometimes, went, several, days, without, sleep, had, extreme, increases, in, energy, drove, recklessly, and, in, later, life, endured, severe, depressive, episodes, on, 27, september, 1982, two, days, after, his, 50th, birthday, after, experiencing, a, severe, headache, gould, had, a, stroke, that, paralyzed, the, left, side, of, his, body, he, was, admitted, to, toronto, general, hospital, and, his, condition, rapidly, deteriorated, by, 4, october, there, was, evidence, of, brain, damage, and, gould, s, father, decided, that, his, son, should, be, taken, off, life, support, gould, s, public, funeral, was, held, in, st, paul, s, anglican, church, on, 15, october, with, singing, by, lois, marshall, and, maureen, forrester, the, service, was, attended, by, over, 3, 000, people, and, was, broadcast, on, the, canadian, broadcasting, corporation, he, is, buried, next, to, his, parents, in, toronto, s, mount, pleasant, cemetery, section, 38, lot, 1050, the, first, few, bars, of, the, goldberg, variations, are, carved, on, his, grave, marker, an, animal, lover, gould, left, half, his, estate, to, the, toronto, humane, society, the, other, half, went, to, the, salvation, army, in, 2000, a, movement, disorder, neurologist, suggested, in, a, paper, that, gould, had, dystonia, a, problem, little, understood, in, his, time, gould, periodically, told, interviewers, he, would, have, been, a, writer, if, he, had, not, been, a, pianist, he, expounded, his, criticism, and, philosophy, of, music, and, art, in, lectures, convocation, speeches, periodicals, and, cbc, radio, and, television, documentaries, gould, participated, in, many, interviews, and, had, a, predilection, for, scripting, them, to, the, extent, that, they, may, be, seen, to, be, as, written, work, as, much, as, off, the, cuff, discussions, gould, s, writing, style, was, highly, articulate, but, sometimes, florid, indulgent, and, rhetorical, this, is, especially, evident, in, his, frequent, attempts, at, humour, and, irony, bazzana, writes, that, although, some, of, gould, s, conversational, dazzle, found, its, way, into, his, prolific, written, output, his, writing, was, at, best, uneven, at, worst, awful, while, offering, brilliant, insights, and, provocative, theses, gould, s, writing, is, often, marred, by, long, tortuous, sentences, and, a, false, formality, bazzana, writes, in, his, writing, gould, praised, certain, composers, and, rejected, what, he, deemed, banal, in, music, composition, and, its, consumption, by, the, public, and, also, gave, analyses, of, the, music, of, richard, strauss, alban, berg, and, anton, webern, despite, a, certain, affection, for, dixieland, jazz, gould, was, mostly, averse, to, popular, music, he, enjoyed, a, jazz, concert, with, his, friends, as, a, youth, mentioned, jazz, in, his, writings, and, once, criticized, the, beatles, for, bad, voice, leading, while, praising, petula, clark, and, barbra, streisand, gould, and, jazz, pianist, bill, evans, were, mutual, admirers, and, evans, made, his, record, conversations, with, myself, using, gould, s, steinway, model, cd, 318, piano, gould, s, perspective, on, art, is, often, summed, up, by, this, 1962, quotation, the, justification, of, art, is, the, internal, combustion, it, ignites, in, the, hearts, of, men, and, not, its, shallow, externalized, public, manifestations, the, purpose, of, art, is, not, the, release, of, a, momentary, ejection, of, adrenaline, but, is, rather, the, gradual, lifelong, construction, of, a, state, of, wonder, and, serenity, gould, repeatedly, called, himself, the, last, puritan, a, reference, to, the, philosopher, george, santayana, s, 1935, novel, of, the, same, name, but, he, was, progressive, in, many, ways, promulgating, the, atonal, composers, of, the, early, 20th, century, and, anticipating, through, his, deep, involvement, in, the, recording, process, the, vast, changes, technology, had, on, the, production, and, distribution, of, music, mark, kingwell, summarizes, the, paradox, never, resolved, by, gould, nor, his, biographers, this, way, he, was, progressive, and, anti, progressive, at, once, and, likewise, at, once, both, a, critic, of, the, zeitgeist, and, its, most, interesting, expression, he, was, in, effect, stranded, on, a, beachhead, of, his, own, thinking, between, past, and, future, that, he, was, not, able, by, himself, to, fashion, a, bridge, between, them, is, neither, surprising, nor, in, the, end, disappointing, we, should, see, this, failure, rather, as, an, aspect, of, his, genius, he, both, was, and, was, not, a, man, of, his, time, the, issue, of, authenticity, in, relation, to, an, approach, like, gould, s, has, been, greatly, debated, although, less, so, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, is, a, recording, less, authentic, or, direct, for, having, been, highly, refined, by, technical, means, in, the, studio, gould, likened, his, process, to, that, of, a, film, director, one, knows, that, a, two, hour, film, was, not, made, in, two, hours, and, implicitly, asked, why, the, recording, of, music, should, be, different, he, went, so, far, as, to, conduct, an, experiment, with, musicians, sound, engineers, and, laypeople, in, which, they, were, to, listen, to, a, recording, and, determine, where, the, splices, occurred, each, group, chose, different, points, but, none, was, wholly, successful, while, the, test, was, hardly, scientific, gould, remarked, the, tape, does, lie, and, nearly, always, gets, away, with, it, in, the, lecture, and, essay, forgery, and, imitation, in, the, creative, process, one, of, his, most, significant, texts, gould, makes, explicit, his, views, on, authenticity, and, creativity, he, asks, why, the, epoch, in, which, a, work, is, received, influences, its, reception, as, art, postulating, a, sonata, of, his, own, composition, that, sounds, so, like, one, of, haydn, s, that, it, is, received, as, such, if, instead, the, sonata, had, been, attributed, to, an, earlier, or, later, composer, it, becomes, more, or, less, interesting, as, a, piece, of, music, yet, it, is, not, the, work, that, has, changed, but, its, relation, within, the, accepted, narrative, of, music, history, similarly, gould, notes, the, pathetic, duplicity, in, the, reception, of, high, quality, forgeries, by, han, van, meegeren, of, new, paintings, attributed, to, the, dutch, master, johannes, vermeer, before, and, after, the, forgery, was, known, gould, preferred, an, ahistorical, or, at, least, pre, renaissance, view, of, art, minimizing, the, identity, of, the, artist, and, the, attendant, historical, context, in, evaluating, the, artwork, what, gives, us, the, right, to, assume, that, in, the, work, of, art, we, must, receive, a, direct, communication, with, the, historical, attitudes, of, another, period, moreover, what, makes, us, assume, that, the, situation, of, the, man, who, wrote, it, accurately, or, faithfully, reflects, the, situation, of, his, time, what, if, the, composer, as, historian, is, faulty, in, creating, music, gould, much, preferred, the, control, and, intimacy, provided, by, the, recording, studio, he, disliked, the, concert, hall, which, he, compared, to, a, competitive, sporting, arena, he, gave, his, final, public, performance, in, 1964, and, thereafter, devoted, his, career, to, the, studio, recording, albums, and, several, radio, documentaries, he, was, attracted, to, the, technical, aspects, of, recording, and, considered, the, manipulation, of, tape, to, be, another, part, of, the, creative, process, although, gould, s, recording, studio, producers, have, testified, that, he, needed, splicing, less, than, most, performers, gould, used, the, process, to, give, himself, total, artistic, control, over, the, recording, process, he, recounted, his, recording, of, the, a, minor, fugue, from, book, i, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, and, how, it, was, spliced, together, from, two, takes, with, the, fugue, s, expositions, from, one, take, and, its, episodes, from, another, gould, s, first, commercial, recording, of, berg, s, piano, sonata, op, 1, came, in, 1953, on, the, short, lived, canadian, hallmark, label, he, soon, signed, with, columbia, records, classical, music, division, and, in, 1955, recorded, bach, the, goldberg, variations, his, breakthrough, work, although, there, was, some, controversy, at, columbia, about, the, appropriateness, of, this, debut, piece, the, record, received, extraordinary, praise, and, was, among, the, best, selling, classical, music, albums, of, its, era, gould, became, closely, associated, with, the, piece, playing, it, in, full, or, in, part, at, many, recitals, a, new, recording, of, the, goldberg, variations, in, 1981, was, among, his, last, albums, the, piece, was, one, of, a, few, he, recorded, twice, in, the, studio, the, 1981, release, was, one, of, cbs, masterworks, first, digital, recordings, the, 1955, interpretation, is, highly, energetic, and, often, frenetic, the, later, is, slower, and, more, deliberate, gould, wanted, to, treat, the, aria, and, its, 30, variations, as, a, cohesive, whole, gould, said, bach, was, first, and, last, an, architect, a, constructor, of, sound, and, what, makes, him, so, inestimably, valuable, to, us, is, that, he, was, beyond, a, doubt, the, greatest, architect, of, sound, who, ever, lived, he, recorded, most, of, bach, s, other, keyboard, works, including, both, books, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, and, the, partitas, french, suites, english, suites, inventions, and, sinfonias, keyboard, concertos, and, a, number, of, toccatas, which, interested, him, least, being, less, polyphonic, for, his, only, recording, at, the, organ, he, recorded, some, of, the, art, of, fugue, which, was, also, released, posthumously, on, piano, as, for, beethoven, gould, preferred, the, composer, s, early, and, late, periods, he, recorded, all, five, of, the, piano, concertos, 23, of, the, piano, sonatas, and, numerous, bagatelles, and, variations, gould, was, the, first, pianist, to, record, any, of, liszt, s, piano, transcriptions, of, beethoven, s, symphonies, beginning, with, the, fifth, symphony, in, 1967, with, the, sixth, released, in, 1969, gould, also, recorded, works, by, brahms, mozart, and, many, other, prominent, piano, composers, though, he, was, outspoken, in, his, criticism, of, the, romantic, era, as, a, whole, he, was, extremely, critical, of, chopin, when, asked, whether, he, found, himself, wanting, to, play, chopin, he, replied, no, i, don, t, i, play, it, in, a, weak, moment, maybe, once, a, year, or, twice, a, year, for, myself, but, it, doesn, t, convince, me, but, in, 1970, he, played, chopin, s, b, minor, sonata, for, the, cbc, and, said, he, liked, some, of, the, miniatures, and, sort, of, liked, the, first, movement, of, the, b, minor, although, he, recorded, all, of, mozart, s, sonatas, and, admitted, enjoying, the, actual, playing, of, them, gould, said, he, disliked, mozart, s, later, works, he, was, fond, of, a, number, of, lesser, known, composers, such, as, orlando, gibbons, whose, anthems, he, had, heard, as, a, teenager, and, whose, music, he, felt, a, spiritual, attachment, to, he, recorded, a, number, of, gibbons, s, keyboard, works, and, called, him, his, favourite, composer, despite, his, better, known, admiration, for, bach, he, made, recordings, of, piano, music, by, jean, sibelius, the, sonatines, and, kyllikki, georges, bizet, the, variations, chromatiques, de, concert, and, the, premier, nocturne, richard, strauss, the, piano, sonata, the, five, pieces, and, enoch, arden, with, claude, rains, and, hindemith, the, three, piano, sonatas, and, the, sonatas, for, brass, and, piano, he, also, made, recordings, of, schoenberg, s, complete, piano, works, in, early, september, 1982, gould, made, his, final, recording, strauss, s, piano, sonata, in, b, minor, the, success, of, gould, s, collaborations, was, to, a, degree, dependent, upon, his, collaborators, receptiveness, to, his, sometimes, unconventional, readings, of, the, music, the, musicologist, michael, stegemann, considered, gould, s, television, collaboration, with, american, violinist, yehudi, menuhin, in, 1965, in, which, they, played, works, by, bach, beethoven, and, schoenberg, a, success, because, menuhin, was, ready, to, embrace, the, new, perspectives, opened, up, by, an, unorthodox, view, but, stegemann, deemed, the, 1966, collaboration, with, soprano, elisabeth, schwarzkopf, recording, strauss, s, ophelia, lieder, an, outright, fiasco, schwarzkopf, believed, in, total, fidelity, to, the, score, and, objected, to, the, temperature, the, studio, was, incredibly, overheated, which, may, be, good, for, a, pianist, but, not, for, a, singer, a, dry, throat, is, the, end, as, far, as, singing, is, concerned, but, we, persevered, nonetheless, it, wasn, t, easy, for, me, gould, began, by, improvising, something, straussian, we, thought, he, was, simply, warming, up, but, no, he, continued, to, play, like, that, throughout, the, actual, recordings, as, though, strauss, s, notes, were, just, a, pretext, that, allowed, him, to, improvise, freely, gould, recorded, schoenberg, hindemith, and, ernst, krenek, with, numerous, vocalists, including, donald, gramm, and, ellen, faull, he, also, recorded, bach, s, six, sonatas, for, violin, and, harpsichord, bwv, 1014, 1019, with, jaime, laredo, and, the, three, sonatas, for, viola, da, gamba, and, keyboard, with, leonard, rose, claude, rains, narrated, their, recording, of, strauss, s, melodrama, enoch, arden, gould, also, collaborated, with, members, of, the, new, york, philharmonic, the, flutist, julius, baker, and, the, violinist, rafael, druian, in, a, recording, of, bach, s, brandenburg, concerto, no, 4, and, with, leopold, stokowski, and, the, american, symphony, orchestra, in, a, performance, of, beethoven, s, piano, concerto, no, 5, in, 1966, gould, collaborated, extensively, with, vladimir, golschmann, and, the, columbia, symphony, orchestra, for, the, columbia, masterworks, label, in, his, recording, of, beethoven, s, piano, concerto, no, 1, in, 1958, and, several, works, by, bach, in, the, 1960s, including, the, keyboard, concerto, no, 3, bwv, 1054, the, keyboard, concerto, no, 5, bwv, 1056, and, the, keyboard, concerto, no, 7, bwv, 1058, in, 1967, and, the, keyboard, concerto, no, 2, in, e, major, bwv, 1053, and, the, keyboard, concerto, no, 4, in, a, major, bwv, 1055, in, 1969, gould, made, numerous, television, and, radio, programs, for, cbc, television, and, cbc, radio, notable, productions, include, his, musique, concr, te, solitude, trilogy, which, consists, of, the, idea, of, north, a, meditation, on, northern, canada, and, its, people, the, latecomers, about, newfoundland, and, the, quiet, in, the, land, about, mennonites, in, manitoba, all, three, use, a, radiophonic, electronic, music, technique, that, gould, called, contrapuntal, radio, in, which, several, people, are, heard, speaking, at, once, much, like, the, voices, in, a, fugue, manipulated, through, overdubbing, and, editing, his, experience, of, driving, across, northern, ontario, while, listening, to, top, 40, radio, in, 1967, inspired, one, of, his, most, unusual, radio, pieces, the, search, for, petula, clark, a, witty, and, eloquent, dissertation, on, clark, s, recordings, also, among, gould, s, cbc, programs, was, an, educational, lecture, on, the, music, of, bach, glenn, gould, on, bach, which, featured, a, collaborative, performance, with, julius, baker, and, oscar, shumsky, of, the, brandenburg, concerto, no, 5, gould, was, also, a, prolific, transcriber, of, orchestral, repertoire, for, piano, he, transcribed, his, own, wagner, and, ravel, recordings, as, well, as, strauss, s, operas, and, schubert, s, and, bruckner, s, symphonies, which, he, played, privately, for, pleasure, gould, dabbled, in, composition, with, few, finished, works, as, a, teenager, he, wrote, chamber, music, and, piano, works, in, the, style, of, the, second, viennese, school, significant, works, include, a, string, quartet, which, he, finished, in, his, 20s, published, 1956, recorded, 1960, and, his, cadenzas, to, beethoven, s, piano, concerto, no, 1, later, works, include, the, lieberson, madrigal, soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and, piano, and, so, you, want, to, write, a, fugue, satb, with, piano, or, string, quartet, accompaniment, his, string, quartet, op, 1, received, a, mixed, reaction, the, christian, science, monitor, and, saturday, review, were, quite, laudatory, the, montreal, star, less, so, there, is, little, critical, commentary, on, gould, s, compositions, because, there, are, few, of, them, he, never, succeeded, beyond, opus, 1, and, left, a, number, of, works, unfinished, he, attributed, his, failure, as, a, composer, to, his, lack, of, a, personal, voice, most, of, his, work, is, published, by, schott, music, the, recording, glenn, gould, the, composer, contains, his, original, works, towards, the, end, of, his, life, gould, began, conducting, he, had, earlier, directed, bach, s, brandenburg, concerto, no, 5, and, the, cantata, widerstehe, doch, der, s, nde, from, the, harpsipiano, a, piano, with, metal, hammers, to, simulate, a, harpsichord, s, sound, and, gustav, mahler, s, symphony, no, 2, the, urlicht, section, in, the, 1960s, his, first, known, public, appearance, conducting, occurred, in, 1939, when, he, was, six, while, appearing, as, a, pianist, in, a, concert, for, the, business, men, s, bible, class, in, uxbridge, by, 1957, he, emerged, as, the, conductor, for, the, cbc, television, program, chrysler, festival, in, which, he, collaborated, with, maureen, forrester, in, the, same, year, he, also, joined, forces, with, the, cbc, vancouver, orchestra, as, a, conductor, in, a, radio, broadcast, of, mozart, s, symphony, no, 1, and, schubert, s, symphony, no, 4, tragic, in, 1958, gould, wrote, to, golschmann, of, his, temporary, retirement, from, conducting, apparently, as, a, result, of, the, unanticipated, muscular, strain, it, created, gould, found, himself, practically, crippled, after, his, conducting, appearances, and, unable, to, perform, properly, at, the, piano, yet, even, at, the, age, of, 26, gould, continued, to, contemplate, retiring, as, a, piano, soloist, and, devoting, himself, entirely, to, conducting, immediately, before, his, death, he, was, finalizing, plans, to, appear, as, a, conductor, of, beethoven, s, piano, concerto, no, 2, in, 1982, and, in, recordings, of, mendelssohn, s, hebrides, overture, and, beethoven, s, coriolan, overture, in, 1983, his, last, recording, as, a, conductor, was, of, wagner, s, siegfried, idyll, in, its, original, chamber, music, scoring, he, intended, to, spend, his, later, years, conducting, writing, about, music, and, composing, while, pursuing, an, idyllic, neothoreauvian, way, of, life, in, the, countryside, gould, is, one, of, the, most, acclaimed, musicians, of, the, 20th, century, his, unique, pianistic, method, insight, into, the, architecture, of, compositions, and, relatively, free, interpretation, of, scores, created, performances, and, recordings, that, were, revelatory, to, many, listeners, and, highly, objectionable, to, others, philosopher, mark, kingwell, wrote, his, influence, is, made, inescapable, no, performer, after, him, can, avoid, the, example, he, sets, now, everyone, must, perform, through, him, he, can, be, emulated, or, rejected, but, he, cannot, be, ignored, among, the, pianists, who, acknowledged, gould, s, influence, are, andr, s, schiff, zolt, n, kocsis, ivo, pogoreli, and, peter, serkin, artists, influenced, by, gould, include, painter, george, condo, one, of,

of, whom, have, abandoned, their, careers, as, concert, pianists, due, to, the, intimidating, example, of, gould, s, genius, gould, left, an, extensive, body, of, work, beyond, the, keyboard, after, retiring, from, concertising, he, was, increasingly, interested, in, other, media, including, audio, and, film, documentary, and, writing, through, which, he, mused, on, aesthetics, composition,
