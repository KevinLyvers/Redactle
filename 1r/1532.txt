of, wellesley, s, birth, is, not, known, but, biographers, mostly, follow, the, same, contemporary, newspaper, evidence, which, states, that, he, was, born, on, 1, may, 1769, the, day, before, he, was, baptised, in, st, peter, s, church, on, aungier, street, in, dublin, however, ernest, lloyd, states, registry, of, st, peter, s, church, dublin, shows, that, he, was, christened, there, on, 30, april, 1769, his, baptismal, font, was, donated, to, st, nahi, s, church, in, dundrum, dublin, in, 1914, wellesley, may, have, been, born, at, his, parents, townhouse, mornington, house, at, 6, merrion, street, the, address, later, became, known, as, 24, upper, merrion, street, dublin, which, now, forms, part, of, the, merrion, hotel, his, mother, anne, countess, of, mornington, recalled, in, 1815, that, he, had, been, born, at, 6, merrion, street, his, family, s, home, at, dangan, castle, dangan, near, summerhill, county, meath, has, also, been, purported, to, have, been, his, birthplace, in, his, obituary, published, in, the, times, in, 1852, it, was, reported, that, dangan, was, unanimously, believed, to, have, been, the, place, of, his, birth, though, suggested, it, was, unlikely, but, not, impossible, that, the, family, had, travelled, to, dublin, for, his, baptism, a, pillar, was, erected, in, his, honour, near, dangan, in, 1817, the, place, of, his, birth, has, been, much, disputed, following, his, death, with, sir, j, d, burke, writing, the, following, in, 1873, isn, t, it, remarkable, that, until, recently, all, the, old, memoirs, of, the, duke, of, wellington, seemed, to, infer, that, county, meath, was, the, place, of, birth, nowadays, the, theory, that, he, was, born, in, dublin, is, generally, accepted, but, by, no, means, proved, other, places, that, have, been, put, forward, as, the, location, of, his, birth, include, a, coach, between, meath, and, dublin, the, dublin, packet, boat, and, the, wellesley, townhouse, in, trim, county, meath, wellesley, spent, most, of, his, childhood, at, his, family, s, two, homes, the, first, a, large, house, in, dublin, mornington, house, and, the, second, dangan, castle, 3, miles, 5, km, north, of, summerhill, in, county, meath, in, 1781, arthur, s, father, died, and, his, eldest, brother, richard, inherited, his, father, s, earldom, he, went, to, the, diocesan, school, in, trim, when, at, dangan, mr, whyte, s, academy, when, in, dublin, and, brown, s, school, in, chelsea, when, in, london, he, then, enrolled, at, eton, college, where, he, studied, from, 1781, to, 1784, his, loneliness, there, caused, him, to, hate, it, and, makes, it, highly, unlikely, that, he, actually, said, the, battle, of, waterloo, was, won, on, the, playing, fields, of, eton, a, quotation, which, is, often, attributed, to, him, moreover, eton, had, no, playing, fields, at, the, time, in, 1785, a, lack, of, success, at, eton, combined, with, a, shortage, of, family, funds, due, to, his, father, s, death, forced, the, young, wellesley, and, his, mother, to, move, to, brussels, until, his, early, twenties, arthur, showed, little, sign, of, distinction, and, his, mother, grew, increasingly, concerned, at, his, idleness, stating, i, don, t, know, what, i, shall, do, with, my, awkward, son, arthur, in, 1786, arthur, enrolled, in, the, french, royal, academy, of, equitation, in, angers, where, he, progressed, significantly, becoming, a, good, horseman, and, learning, french, which, later, proved, very, useful, upon, returning, to, england, later, the, same, year, he, astonished, his, mother, with, his, improvement, despite, his, new, promise, wellesley, had, yet, to, find, a, job, and, his, family, was, still, short, of, money, so, upon, the, advice, of, his, mother, his, brother, richard, asked, his, friend, the, duke, of, rutland, then, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, to, consider, arthur, for, a, commission, in, the, army, soon, afterward, on, 7, march, 1787, he, was, gazetted, ensign, in, the, 73rd, regiment, of, foot, in, october, with, the, assistance, of, his, brother, he, was, assigned, as, aide, de, camp, on, ten, shillings, a, day, twice, his, pay, as, an, ensign, to, the, new, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, lord, buckingham, he, was, also, transferred, to, the, new, 76th, regiment, forming, in, ireland, and, on, christmas, day, 1787, was, promoted, lieutenant, during, his, time, in, dublin, his, duties, were, mainly, social, attending, balls, entertaining, guests, and, providing, advice, to, buckingham, while, in, ireland, he, overextended, himself, in, borrowing, due, to, his, occasional, gambling, but, in, his, defence, stated, that, i, have, often, known, what, it, was, to, be, in, want, of, money, but, i, have, never, got, helplessly, into, debt, on, 23, january, 1788, he, transferred, into, the, 41st, regiment, of, foot, then, again, on, 25, june, 1789, he, transferred, to, the, 12th, prince, of, wales, s, regiment, of, light, dragoons, and, according, to, military, historian, richard, holmes, he, also, reluctantly, entered, politics, shortly, before, the, general, election, of, 1789, he, went, to, the, rotten, borough, of, trim, to, speak, against, the, granting, of, the, title, freeman, of, dublin, to, the, parliamentary, leader, of, the, irish, patriot, party, henry, grattan, succeeding, he, was, later, nominated, and, duly, elected, as, a, member, of, parliament, mp, for, trim, in, the, irish, house, of, commons, because, of, the, limited, suffrage, at, the, time, he, sat, in, a, parliament, where, at, least, two, thirds, of, the, members, owed, their, election, to, the, landowners, of, fewer, than, a, hundred, boroughs, wellesley, continued, to, serve, at, dublin, castle, voting, with, the, government, in, the, irish, parliament, over, the, next, two, years, he, became, a, captain, on, 30, january, 1791, and, was, transferred, to, the, 58th, regiment, of, foot, on, 31, october, he, transferred, to, the, 18th, light, dragoons, and, it, was, during, this, period, that, he, grew, increasingly, attracted, to, kitty, pakenham, the, daughter, of, edward, pakenham, 2nd, baron, longford, she, was, described, as, being, full, of, gaiety, and, charm, in, 1793, he, proposed, but, was, turned, down, by, her, brother, thomas, 2nd, earl, of, longford, who, considered, wellesley, to, be, a, young, man, in, debt, with, very, poor, prospects, an, aspiring, amateur, musician, wellesley, devastated, by, the, rejection, burnt, his, violins, in, anger, and, resolved, to, pursue, a, military, career, in, earnest, he, became, a, major, by, purchase, in, the, 33rd, regiment, in, 1793, a, few, months, later, in, september, his, brother, lent, him, more, money, and, with, it, he, purchased, a, lieutenant, colonelcy, in, the, 33rd, in, 1793, the, duke, of, york, was, sent, to, flanders, in, command, of, the, british, contingent, of, an, allied, force, destined, for, the, invasion, of, france, in, june, 1794, wellesley, with, the, 33rd, regiment, set, sail, from, cork, bound, for, ostend, as, part, of, an, expedition, bringing, reinforcements, for, the, army, in, flanders, they, arrived, too, late, to, participate, and, joined, the, duke, of, york, as, he, was, pulling, back, towards, the, netherlands, on, 15, september, 1794, at, the, battle, of, boxtel, east, of, breda, wellington, in, temporary, command, of, his, brigade, had, his, first, experience, of, battle, during, general, abercromby, s, withdrawal, in, the, face, of, superior, french, forces, the, 33rd, held, off, enemy, cavalry, allowing, neighbouring, units, to, retreat, safely, during, the, extremely, harsh, winter, that, followed, wellesley, and, his, regiment, formed, part, of, an, allied, force, holding, the, defence, line, along, the, waal, river, the, 33rd, along, with, the, rest, of, the, army, suffered, heavy, losses, from, attrition, and, illness, wellesley, s, health, was, also, affected, by, the, damp, environment, though, the, campaign, was, to, end, disastrously, with, the, british, army, driven, out, of, the, united, provinces, into, the, german, states, wellesley, became, more, aware, of, battle, tactics, including, the, use, of, lines, of, infantry, against, advancing, columns, and, the, merits, of, supporting, sea, power, he, understood, that, the, failure, of, the, campaign, was, due, in, part, to, the, faults, of, the, leaders, and, the, poor, organisation, at, headquarters, he, remarked, later, of, his, time, in, the, netherlands, that, at, least, i, learned, what, not, to, do, and, that, is, always, a, valuable, lesson, returning, to, england, in, march, 1795, he, was, reinstated, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, trim, he, hoped, to, be, given, the, position, of, secretary, of, war, in, the, new, irish, government, but, the, new, lord, lieutenant, lord, camden, was, only, able, to, offer, him, the, post, of, surveyor, general, of, the, ordnance, declining, the, post, he, returned, to, his, regiment, now, at, southampton, preparing, to, set, sail, for, the, west, indies, after, seven, weeks, at, sea, a, storm, forced, the, fleet, back, to, poole, the, 33rd, was, given, time, to, recuperate, and, a, few, months, later, whitehall, decided, to, send, the, regiment, to, india, wellesley, was, promoted, full, colonel, by, seniority, on, 3, may, 1796, and, a, few, weeks, later, set, sail, for, calcutta, with, his, regiment, arriving, in, calcutta, in, february, 1797, he, spent, 5, months, there, before, being, sent, in, august, to, a, brief, expedition, to, the, philippines, where, he, established, a, list, of, new, hygiene, precautions, for, his, men, to, deal, with, the, unfamiliar, climate, returning, in, november, to, india, he, learnt, that, his, elder, brother, richard, now, known, as, lord, mornington, had, been, appointed, as, the, new, governor, general, of, india, in, 1798, he, changed, the, spelling, of, his, surname, to, wellesley, up, to, this, time, he, was, still, known, as, wesley, which, his, eldest, brother, considered, the, ancient, and, proper, spelling, as, part, of, the, campaign, to, extend, the, rule, of, the, british, east, india, company, the, fourth, anglo, mysore, war, broke, out, in, 1798, against, the, sultan, of, mysore, tipu, sultan, arthur, s, brother, richard, ordered, that, an, armed, force, be, sent, to, capture, seringapatam, and, defeat, tipu, during, the, war, rockets, were, used, on, several, occasions, wellesley, was, almost, defeated, by, tipu, s, diwan, purnaiah, at, the, battle, of, sultanpet, tope, quoting, forrest, at, this, point, near, the, village, of, sultanpet, figure, 5, there, was, a, large, tope, or, grove, which, gave, shelter, to, tipu, s, rocketmen, and, had, obviously, to, be, cleaned, out, before, the, siege, could, be, pressed, closer, to, srirangapattana, island, the, commander, chosen, for, this, operation, was, col, wellesley, but, advancing, towards, the, tope, after, dark, on, the, 5th, april, 1799, he, was, set, upon, with, rockets, and, musket, fires, lost, his, way, and, as, beatson, politely, puts, it, had, to, postpone, the, attack, until, a, more, favourable, opportunity, should, offer, the, following, day, wellesley, launched, a, fresh, attack, with, a, larger, force, and, took, the, whole, position, without, any, killed, in, action, on, 22, april, 1799, twelve, days, before, the, main, battle, rocketeers, maneuvered, to, the, rear, of, the, british, encampment, then, threw, a, great, number, of, rockets, at, the, same, instant, to, signal, the, beginning, of, an, assault, by, 6, 000, indian, infantry, and, a, corps, of, frenchmen, all, ordered, by, mir, golam, hussain, and, mohomed, hulleen, mir, miran, the, rockets, had, a, range, of, about, 1, 000, yards, some, burst, in, the, air, like, shells, others, called, ground, rockets, would, rise, again, on, striking, the, ground, and, bound, along, in, a, serpentine, motion, until, their, force, was, spent, according, to, one, british, observer, a, young, english, officer, named, bayly, so, pestered, were, we, with, the, rocket, boys, that, there, was, no, moving, without, danger, from, the, destructive, missiles, he, continued, the, rockets, and, musketry, from, 20, 000, of, the, enemy, were, incessant, no, hail, could, be, thicker, every, illumination, of, blue, lights, was, accompanied, by, a, shower, of, rockets, some, of, which, entered, the, head, of, the, column, passing, through, to, the, rear, causing, death, wounds, and, dreadful, lacerations, from, the, long, bamboos, of, twenty, or, thirty, feet, which, are, invariably, attached, to, them, under, the, command, of, general, harris, some, 24, 000, troops, were, dispatched, to, madras, to, join, an, equal, force, being, sent, from, bombay, in, the, west, arthur, and, the, 33rd, sailed, to, join, them, in, august, after, extensive, and, careful, logistic, preparation, which, would, become, one, of, wellesley, s, main, attributes, the, 33rd, left, with, the, main, force, in, december, and, travelled, across, 250, miles, 402, km, of, jungle, from, madras, to, mysore, on, account, of, his, brother, during, the, journey, wellesley, was, given, an, additional, command, that, of, chief, advisor, to, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, s, army, sent, to, accompany, the, british, force, this, position, was, to, cause, friction, among, many, of, the, senior, officers, some, of, whom, were, senior, to, wellesley, much, of, this, friction, was, put, to, rest, after, the, battle, of, mallavelly, some, 20, miles, 32, km, from, seringapatam, in, which, harris, army, attacked, a, large, part, of, the, sultan, s, army, during, the, battle, wellesley, led, his, men, in, a, line, of, battle, of, two, ranks, against, the, enemy, to, a, gentle, ridge, and, gave, the, order, to, fire, after, an, extensive, repetition, of, volleys, followed, by, a, bayonet, charge, the, 33rd, in, conjunction, with, the, rest, of, harris, s, force, forced, tipu, s, infantry, to, retreat, immediately, after, their, arrival, at, seringapatam, on, 5, april, 1799, the, battle, of, seringapatam, began, and, wellesley, was, ordered, to, lead, a, night, attack, on, the, village, of, sultanpettah, adjacent, to, the, fortress, to, clear, the, way, for, the, artillery, because, of, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, mysorean, army, s, strong, defensive, preparations, and, the, darkness, the, attack, failed, with, 25, casualties, due, to, confusion, among, the, british, wellesley, suffered, a, minor, injury, to, his, knee, from, a, spent, musket, ball, although, they, would, re, attack, successfully, the, next, day, after, time, to, scout, ahead, the, enemy, s, positions, the, affair, affected, wellesley, he, resolved, never, to, attack, an, enemy, who, is, preparing, and, strongly, posted, and, whose, posts, have, not, been, reconnoitred, by, daylight, lewin, bentham, bowring, gives, this, alternative, account, one, of, these, groves, called, the, sultanpet, tope, was, intersected, by, deep, ditches, watered, from, a, channel, running, in, an, easterly, direction, about, a, mile, from, the, fort, general, baird, was, directed, to, scour, this, grove, and, dislodge, the, enemy, but, on, his, advancing, with, this, object, on, the, night, of, the, 5th, he, found, the, tope, unoccupied, the, next, day, however, the, mysore, troops, again, took, possession, of, the, ground, and, as, it, was, absolutely, necessary, to, expel, them, two, columns, were, detached, at, sunset, for, the, purpose, the, first, of, these, under, colonel, shawe, got, possession, of, a, ruined, village, which, it, successfully, held, the, second, column, under, colonel, wellesley, on, advancing, into, the, tope, was, at, once, attacked, in, the, darkness, of, night, by, a, tremendous, fire, of, musketry, and, rockets, the, men, floundering, about, amidst, the, trees, and, the, water, courses, at, last, broke, and, fell, back, in, disorder, some, being, killed, and, a, few, taken, prisoners, in, the, confusion, colonel, wellesley, was, himself, struck, on, the, knee, by, a, spent, ball, and, narrowly, escaped, falling, into, the, hands, of, the, enemy, a, few, weeks, later, after, extensive, artillery, bombardment, a, breach, was, opened, in, the, main, walls, of, the, fortress, of, seringapatam, an, attack, led, by, major, general, baird, secured, the, fortress, wellesley, secured, the, rear, of, the, advance, posting, guards, at, the, breach, and, then, stationed, his, regiment, at, the, main, palace, after, hearing, news, of, the, death, of, the, tipu, sultan, wellesley, was, the, first, at, the, scene, to, confirm, his, death, checking, his, pulse, over, the, coming, day, wellesley, grew, increasingly, concerned, over, the, lack, of, discipline, among, his, men, who, drank, and, pillaged, the, fortress, and, city, to, restore, order, several, soldiers, were, flogged, and, four, hanged, after, battle, and, the, resulting, end, of, the, war, the, main, force, under, general, harris, left, seringapatam, and, wellesley, aged, 30, stayed, behind, to, command, the, area, as, the, new, governor, of, seringapatam, and, mysore, while, in, india, wellesley, was, ill, for, a, considerable, time, first, with, severe, diarrhoea, from, the, water, and, then, with, fever, followed, by, a, serious, skin, infection, caused, by, trichophyton, wellesley, was, in, charge, of, raising, an, anglo, indian, expeditionary, force, in, trincomali, in, early, 1801, for, the, capture, of, batavia, and, mauritius, from, the, french, however, on, the, eve, of, its, departure, orders, arrived, from, england, that, it, was, to, be, sent, to, egypt, to, co, operate, with, sir, ralph, abercromby, in, the, expulsion, of, the, french, from, egypt, wellesley, had, been, appointed, second, in, command, to, baird, but, owing, to, ill, health, did, not, accompany, the, expedition, on, 9, april, 1801, this, was, fortunate, for, wellesley, since, the, vessel, on, which, he, was, to, have, sailed, sank, in, the, red, sea, he, was, promoted, to, brigadier, general, on, 17, july, 1801, he, took, residence, within, the, sultan, s, summer, palace, and, reformed, the, tax, and, justice, systems, in, his, province, to, maintain, order, and, prevent, bribery, in, 1800, whilst, serving, as, governor, of, mysore, wellesley, was, tasked, with, putting, down, an, insurgency, led, by, dhoondiah, waugh, formerly, a, patan, trooper, for, tipu, sultan, having, escaped, after, the, fall, of, seringapatam, he, became, a, powerful, brigand, raiding, villages, along, the, maratha, mysore, border, region, despite, initial, setbacks, the, east, india, company, having, pursued, and, destroyed, his, forces, once, already, forcing, him, into, retreat, in, august, 1799, he, raised, a, sizeable, force, composed, of, disbanded, mysore, soldiers, captured, small, outposts, and, forts, in, mysore, and, was, receiving, the, support, of, several, maratha, killedars, opposed, to, british, occupation, this, drew, the, attention, of, the, british, administration, who, were, beginning, to, recognise, him, as, more, than, just, a, bandit, as, his, raids, expansion, and, threats, to, destabilise, british, authority, suddenly, increased, in, 1800, the, death, of, tipu, sultan, had, created, a, power, vacuum, and, waugh, was, seeking, to, fill, it, given, independent, command, of, a, combined, east, india, company, and, british, army, force, wellesley, ventured, north, to, confront, waugh, in, june, 1800, with, an, army, of, 8, 000, infantry, and, cavalry, having, learnt, that, waugh, s, forces, numbered, over, 50, 000, although, the, majority, around, 30, 000, were, irregular, light, cavalry, and, unlikely, to, pose, a, serious, threat, to, british, infantry, and, artillery, throughout, june, august, 1800, wellesley, advanced, through, waugh, s, territory, his, troops, escalading, forts, in, turn, and, capturing, each, one, with, trifling, loss, the, forts, generally, offered, little, resistance, due, to, their, poor, construction, and, design, wellesley, did, not, have, sufficient, troops, to, garrison, each, fort, and, had, to, clear, the, surrounding, area, of, insurgents, before, advancing, to, the, next, fort, on, 31, july, he, had, taken, and, destroyed, dhoondiah, s, baggage, and, six, guns, and, driven, into, the, malpoorba, where, they, were, drowned, about, five, thousand, people, dhoondiah, continued, to, retreat, but, his, forces, were, rapidly, deserting, he, had, no, infantry, and, due, to, the, monsoon, weather, flooding, river, crossings, he, could, no, longer, outpace, the, british, advance, on, 10, september, at, the, battle, of, conaghul, wellesley, personally, led, a, charge, of, 1, 400, british, dragoons, and, indian, cavalry, in, single, line, with, no, reserve, against, dhoondiah, and, his, remaining, 5, 000, cavalry, dhoondiah, was, killed, during, the, clash, his, body, was, discovered, and, taken, to, the, british, camp, tied, to, a, cannon, with, this, victory, wellesley, s, campaign, was, concluded, and, british, authority, had, been, restored, wellesley, then, paid, for, the, future, upkeep, of, dhoondiah, s, orphaned, son, in, september, 1802, wellesley, learnt, that, he, had, been, promoted, to, the, rank, of, major, general, he, had, been, gazetted, on, 29, april, 1802, but, the, news, took, several, months, to, reach, him, by, sea, he, remained, at, mysore, until, november, when, he, was, sent, to, command, an, army, in, the, second, anglo, maratha, war, when, he, determined, that, a, long, defensive, war, would, ruin, his, army, wellesley, decided, to, act, boldly, to, defeat, the, numerically, larger, force, of, the, maratha, empire, with, the, logistic, assembly, of, his, army, complete, 24, 000, men, in, total, he, gave, the, order, to, break, camp, and, attack, the, nearest, maratha, fort, on, 8, august, 1803, the, fort, surrendered, on, 12, august, after, an, infantry, attack, had, exploited, an, artillery, made, breach, in, the, wall, with, the, fort, now, in, british, control, wellesley, was, able, to, extend, control, southwards, to, the, river, godavari, splitting, his, army, into, two, forces, to, pursue, and, locate, the, main, marathas, army, the, second, force, commanded, by, colonel, stevenson, was, far, smaller, wellesley, was, preparing, to, rejoin, his, forces, on, 24, september, his, intelligence, however, reported, the, location, of, the, marathas, main, army, between, two, rivers, near, assaye, if, he, waited, for, the, arrival, of, his, second, force, the, marathas, would, be, able, to, mount, a, retreat, so, wellesley, decided, to, launch, an, attack, immediately, on, 23, september, wellesley, led, his, forces, over, a, ford, in, the, river, kaitna, and, the, battle, of, assaye, commenced, after, crossing, the, ford, the, infantry, was, reorganised, into, several, lines, and, advanced, against, the, maratha, infantry, wellesley, ordered, his, cavalry, to, exploit, the, flank, of, the, maratha, army, just, near, the, village, during, the, battle, wellesley, himself, came, under, fire, two, of, his, horses, were, shot, from, under, him, and, he, had, to, mount, a, third, at, a, crucial, moment, wellesley, regrouped, his, forces, and, ordered, colonel, maxwell, later, killed, in, the, attack, to, attack, the, eastern, end, of, the, maratha, position, while, wellesley, himself, directed, a, renewed, infantry, attack, against, the, centre, an, officer, in, the, attack, wrote, of, the, importance, of, wellesley, s, personal, leadership, the, general, was, in, the, thick, of, the, action, the, whole, time, i, never, saw, a, man, so, cool, and, collected, as, he, was, though, i, can, assure, you, till, our, troops, got, the, order, to, advance, the, fate, of, the, day, seemed, doubtful, with, some, 6, 000, marathas, killed, or, wounded, the, enemy, was, routed, though, wellesley, s, force, was, in, no, condition, to, pursue, british, casualties, were, heavy, the, british, losses, amounted, to, 428, killed, 1, 138, wounded, and, 18, missing, the, british, casualty, figures, were, taken, from, wellesley, s, own, despatch, wellesley, was, troubled, by, the, loss, of, men, and, remarked, that, he, hoped, i, should, not, like, to, see, again, such, loss, as, i, sustained, on, 23, september, even, if, attended, by, such, gain, years, later, however, he, remarked, that, assaye, and, not, waterloo, was, the, best, battle, he, ever, fought, despite, the, damage, done, to, the, maratha, army, the, battle, did, not, end, the, war, a, few, months, later, in, november, wellesley, attacked, a, larger, force, near, argaum, leading, his, army, to, victory, again, with, an, astonishing, 5, 000, enemy, dead, at, the, cost, of, only, 361, british, casualties, a, further, successful, attack, at, the, fortress, at, gawilghur, combined, with, the, victory, of, general, lake, at, delhi, forced, the, maratha, to, sign, a, peace, settlement, at, anjangaon, not, concluded, until, a, year, later, called, the, treaty, of, surji, anjangaon, military, historian, richard, holmes, remarked, that, wellesley, s, experiences, in, india, had, an, important, influence, on, his, personality, and, military, tactics, teaching, him, much, about, military, matters, that, would, prove, vital, to, his, success, in, the, peninsular, war, these, included, a, strong, sense, of, discipline, through, drill, and, order, the, use, of, diplomacy, to, gain, allies, and, the, vital, necessity, of, a, secure, supply, line, he, also, established, high, regard, for, the, acquisition, of, intelligence, through, scouts, and, spies, his, personal, tastes, also, developed, including, dressing, himself, in, white, trousers, a, dark, tunic, with, hessian, boots, and, black, cocked, hat, that, later, became, synonymous, as, his, style, wellesley, had, grown, tired, of, his, time, in, india, remarking, i, have, served, as, long, in, india, as, any, man, ought, who, can, serve, anywhere, else, in, june, 1804, he, applied, for, permission, to, return, home, and, as, a, reward, for, his, service, in, india, he, was, made, a, knight, of, the, bath, in, september, while, in, india, wellesley, had, amassed, a, fortune, of, 42, 000, considerable, at, the, time, equivalent, to, 4, million, in, 2023, consisting, mainly, of, prize, money, from, his, campaign, when, his, brother, s, term, as, governor, general, of, india, ended, in, march, 1805, the, brothers, returned, together, to, england, on, hms, howe, wellesley, coincidentally, stopped, on, his, voyage, at, the, island, of, saint, helena, and, stayed, in, the, same, building, in, which, napoleon, i, would, live, during, his, later, exile, in, september, 1805, major, general, wellesley, was, newly, returned, from, his, campaigns, in, india, and, was, not, yet, particularly, well, known, to, the, public, he, reported, to, the, office, of, the, secretary, of, state, for, war, and, the, colonies, to, request, a, new, assignment, in, the, waiting, room, he, met, vice, admiral, horatio, nelson, already, a, known, figure, after, his, victories, at, the, nile, and, copenhagen, who, was, briefly, in, england, after, months, pursuing, the, french, toulon, fleet, to, the, west, indies, and, back, some, 30, years, later, wellington, recalled, a, conversation, that, nelson, began, with, him, which, wellesley, found, almost, all, on, his, side, in, a, style, so, vain, and, silly, as, to, surprise, and, almost, disgust, me, nelson, left, the, room, to, inquire, who, the, young, general, was, and, on, his, return, switched, to, a, very, different, tone, discussing, the, war, the, state, of, the, colonies, and, the, geopolitical, situation, as, between, equals, on, this, second, discussion, wellington, recalled, i, don, t, know, that, i, ever, had, a, conversation, that, interested, me, more, this, was, the, only, time, that, the, two, men, met, nelson, was, killed, at, his, victory, at, trafalgar, seven, weeks, later, wellesley, then, served, in, the, abortive, anglo, russian, expedition, to, north, germany, in, 1805, taking, a, brigade, to, elbe, he, then, took, a, period, of, extended, leave, from, the, army, and, was, elected, as, a, tory, member, of, the, british, parliament, for, rye, in, january, 1806, a, year, later, he, was, elected, mp, for, newport, on, the, isle, of, wight, and, was, then, appointed, to, serve, as, chief, secretary, for, ireland, under, the, duke, of, richmond, at, the, same, time, he, was, made, a, privy, counsellor, while, in, ireland, he, gave, a, verbal, promise, that, the, remaining, penal, laws, would, be, enforced, with, great, moderation, perhaps, an, indication, of, his, later, willingness, to, support, catholic, emancipation, wellesley, was, described, as, having, been, handsome, very, brown, quite, bald, and, a, hooked, nose, wellesley, was, in, ireland, in, may, 1807, when, he, heard, of, the, british, expedition, to, denmark, norway, he, decided, to, go, while, maintaining, his, political, appointments, and, was, appointed, to, command, an, infantry, brigade, in, the, second, battle, of, copenhagen, which, took, place, in, august, he, fought, at, k, ge, during, which, the, men, under, his, command, took, 1, 500, prisoners, with, wellesley, later, present, during, the, surrender, by, 30, september, he, had, returned, to, england, and, was, raised, to, the, rank, of, lieutenant, general, on, 25, april, 1808, in, june, 1808, he, accepted, the, command, of, an, expedition, of, 9, 000, men, preparing, to, sail, for, an, attack, on, the, spanish, colonies, in, south, america, to, assist, the, latin, american, patriot, francisco, de, miranda, his, force, was, instead, ordered, to, sail, for, portugal, to, take, part, in, the, peninsular, campaign, and, rendezvous, with, 5, 000, troops, from, gibraltar, ready, for, battle, wellesley, left, cork, on, 12, july, 1808, to, participate, in, the, war, against, french, forces, in, the, iberian, peninsula, with, his, skills, as, a, commander, tested, and, developed, according, to, the, historian, robin, neillands, wellesley, had, by, now, acquired, the, experience, on, which, his, later, successes, were, founded, he, knew, about, command, from, the, ground, up, about, the, importance, of, logistics, about, campaigning, in, a, hostile, environment, he, enjoyed, political, influence, and, realised, the, need, to, maintain, support, at, home, above, all, he, had, gained, a, clear, idea, of, how, by, setting, attainable, objectives, and, relying, on, his, own, force, and, abilities, a, campaign, could, be, fought, and, won, wellesley, defeated, the, french, at, the, battle, of, roli, a, and, the, battle, of, vimeiro, in, 1808, but, was, superseded, in, command, immediately, after, the, latter, battle, general, dalrymple, then, signed, the, controversial, convention, of, sintra, which, stipulated, that, the, royal, navy, transport, the, french, army, out, of, lisbon, with, all, their, loot, and, insisted, on, the, association, of, the, only, available, government, minister, wellesley, dalrymple, and, wellesley, were, recalled, to, britain, to, face, a, court, of, enquiry, wellesley, had, agreed, to, sign, the, preliminary, armistice, but, had, not, signed, the, convention, and, was, cleared, simultaneously, napoleon, entered, spain, with, his, veteran, troops, to, put, down, the, revolt, the, new, commander, of, the, british, forces, in, the, peninsula, sir, john, moore, died, during, the, battle, of, corunna, in, january, 1809, although, overall, the, land, war, with, france, was, not, going, well, from, a, british, perspective, the, peninsula, was, the, one, theatre, where, they, with, the, portuguese, had, provided, strong, resistance, against, france, and, her, allies, this, contrasted, with, the, disastrous, walcheren, expedition, which, was, typical, of, the, mismanaged, british, operations, of, the, time, wellesley, submitted, a, memorandum, to, lord, castlereagh, on, the, defence, of, portugal, he, stressed, its, mountainous, frontiers, and, advocated, lisbon, as, the, main, base, because, the, royal, navy, could, help, to, defend, it, castlereagh, and, the, cabinet, approved, the, memo, and, appointed, him, head, of, all, british, forces, in, portugal, wellesley, arrived, in, lisbon, on, 22, april, 1809, on, board, hms, surveillante, after, narrowly, escaping, shipwreck, reinforced, he, took, to, the, offensive, in, the, second, battle, of, porto, he, crossed, the, douro, river, in, a, daylight, coup, de, main, and, routed, marshal, soult, s, french, troops, in, porto, with, portugal, secured, wellesley, advanced, into, spain, to, unite, with, general, cuesta, s, forces, the, combined, allied, force, prepared, for, an, assault, on, marshal, victor, s, i, corps, at, talavera, 23, july, cuesta, however, was, reluctant, to, agree, and, was, only, persuaded, to, advance, on, the, following, day, the, delay, allowed, the, french, to, withdraw, but, cuesta, sent, his, army, headlong, after, victor, and, found, himself, faced, by, almost, the, entire, french, army, in, new, castile, victor, had, been, reinforced, by, the, toledo, and, madrid, garrisons, the, spanish, retreated, precipitously, necessitating, the, advance, of, two, british, divisions, to, cover, their, retreat, the, next, day, 27, july, at, the, battle, of, talavera, the, french, advanced, in, three, columns, and, were, repulsed, several, times, throughout, the, day, by, wellesley, but, at, a, heavy, cost, to, the, british, force, in, the, aftermath, marshal, soult, s, army, was, discovered, to, be, advancing, south, threatening, to, cut, wellesley, off, from, portugal, wellesley, moved, east, on, 3, august, to, block, it, leaving, 1, 500, wounded, in, the, care, of, the, spanish, intending, to, confront, soult, before, finding, out, that, the, french, were, in, fact, 30, 000, strong, the, british, commander, sent, the, light, brigade, on, a, dash, to, hold, the, bridge, over, the, tagus, at, almaraz, with, communications, and, supply, from, lisbon, secured, for, now, wellesley, considered, joining, with, cuesta, again, but, found, out, that, his, spanish, ally, had, abandoned, the, british, wounded, to, the, french, and, was, thoroughly, uncooperative, promising, and, then, refusing, to, supply, the, british, forces, aggravating, wellesley, and, causing, considerable, friction, between, the, british, and, their, spanish, allies, the, lack, of, supplies, coupled, with, the, threat, of, french, reinforcement, including, the, possible, inclusion, of, napoleon, himself, in, the, spring, led, to, the, british, deciding, to, retreat, into, portugal, following, his, victory, at, talavera, wellesley, was, elevated, to, the, peerage, of, the, united, kingdom, on, 26, august, 1809, as, viscount, wellington, of, talavera, and, of, wellington, in, the, county, of, somerset, with, the, subsidiary, title, of, baron, douro, of, wellesley, in, 1810, a, newly, enlarged, french, army, under, marshal, andr, mass, na, invaded, portugal, british, opinion, was, negative, and, there, were, suggestions, to, evacuate, portugal, instead, lord, wellington, first, slowed, the, french, at, bu, aco, he, then, prevented, them, from, taking, the, lisbon, peninsula, by, the, construction, of, massive, earthworks, known, as, the, lines, of, torres, vedras, which, had, been, assembled, in, complete, secrecy, with, their, flanks, guarded, by, the, royal, navy, the, baffled, and, starving, french, invasion, forces, retreated, after, six, months, wellington, s, pursuit, was, hindered, by, a, series, of, reverses, inflicted, by, marshal, ney, in, a, much, lauded, rear, guard, campaign, in, 1811, mass, na, returned, toward, portugal, to, relieve, almeida, wellington, narrowly, checked, the, french, at, the, battle, of, fuentes, de, o, oro, simultaneously, his, subordinate, viscount, beresford, fought, soult, s, army, of, the, south, to, a, bloody, stalemate, at, the, battle, of, albuera, in, may, wellington, was, promoted, to, full, general, on, 31, july, for, his, services, the, french, abandoned, almeida, avoiding, british, pursuit, but, retained, the, twin, spanish, fortresses, of, ciudad, rodrigo, and, badajoz, the, keys, guarding, the, roads, through, the, mountain, passes, into, portugal, in, 1812, wellington, finally, captured, ciudad, rodrigo, via, a, rapid, movement, as, the, french, went, into, winter, quarters, storming, it, before, they, could, react, he, then, moved, south, quickly, besieged, the, fortress, of, badajoz, for, a, month, and, captured, it, during, the, night, on, 6, april, 1812, on, viewing, the, aftermath, of, the, storming, of, badajoz, wellington, lost, his, composure, and, cried, at, the, sight, of, the, british, dead, in, the,

of, madrid, he, was, later, made, marquess, of, wellington, in, the, said, county, on, 18, august, 1812, wellington, attempted, to, take, the, vital, fortress, of, burgos, which, linked, madrid, to, france, he, failed, due, in, part, to, a, lack, of, siege, guns, forcing, him, into, a, headlong, retreat, with, the, loss, of, over, 2, 000, casualties, the, french, abandoned, andalusia, and, combined, the, troops, of, soult, and, marmont, thus, combined, the, french, outnumbered, the, british, putting, the, british, forces, in, a, precarious, position, wellington, withdrew, his, army, and, joined, by, the, smaller, corps, under, the, command, of, rowland, hill, which, had, been, moved, to, madrid, began, to, retreat, to, portugal, marshal, soult, declined, to, attack, in, 1813, wellington, led, a, new, offensive, this, time, against, the, french, line, of, communications, he, struck, through, the, hills, north, of, burgos, the, tras, os, montes, and, switched, his, supply, line, from, portugal, to, santander, on, spain, s, north, coast, this, led, to, the, french, abandoning, madrid, and, burgos, continuing, to, outflank, the, french, lines, wellington, caught, up, with, and, routed, the, army, of, king, joseph, bonaparte, in, the, battle, of, vitoria, for, which, he, was, promoted, to, field, marshal, on, 21, june, he, personally, led, a, column, against, the,

service, the, scum, of, the, earth, as, common, soldiers, although, later, when, his, temper, had, cooled, he, extended, his, comment, to, praise, the, men, under, his, command, saying, that, though, many, of, the, men, were, the, scum, of, the, earth, it, is, really, wonderful, that, we, should, have, made, them, to, the, fine, fellows, they, are, after, taking, the, small, fortresses, of, pamplona, wellington, invested, san, sebasti, n, but, was, frustrated, by, the, obstinate, french, garrison, losing, 693, dead, and, 316, captured, in, a, failed, assault, and, suspending, the, siege, at, the, end, of, july, soult, s, relief, attempt, was, blocked, by, the, spanish, army, of, galicia, at, san, marcial, allowing, the, allies, to, consolidate, their, position, and, tighten, the,

rival, soult, occurred, at, toulouse, where, the, allied, divisions, were, badly, mauled, storming, the, french, redoubts, losing, some, 4, 600, men, despite, this, momentary, victory, news, arrived, of, napoleon, s, defeat, and, abdication, and, soult, seeing, no, reason, to, continue, the, fighting, agreed, on, a, ceasefire, with, wellington, allowing, soult, to, evacuate, the, city, hailed, as,

keep, part, of, the, works, of, art, from, the, royal, collection, which, he, had, recovered, from, the, french, his, equestrian, portrait, features, prominently, in, the, monument, to, the, battle, of, vitoria, in, present, day, vitoria, gasteiz, his, popularity, in, britain, was, due, to, his, image, and, his, appearance, as, well, as, to, his, military, triumphs, his, victory, fitted, well, with, the, passion, and, intensity, of, the, romantic, movement, with, its, emphasis, on, individuality, his, personal, style, influenced, the, fashions, in, britain, at, the, time, his, tall, lean, figure, and, his, plumed, black, hat, and, grand, yet, classic, uniform, and, white, trousers, became, very, popular, in, late, 1814, the, prime, minister, wanted, him, to, take, command, in, canada, with, the, assignment, of, winning, the, war, of, 1812, against, the, united, states, wellesley, replied, that, he, would, go, to, america, but, he, believed, that, he, was, needed, more, in, europe, he, stated, i, think, you, have, no, right, from, the, state, of, war, to, demand, any, concession, of, territory, from, america, you, have, not, been, able, to, carry, it, into, the, enemy, s, territory, notwithstanding, your, military, success, and, now, undoubted, military, superiority, and, have, not, even, cleared, your, own, territory, on, the, point, of, attack, you, cannot, on, any, principle, of, equality, in, negotiation, claim, a, cession, of, territory, except, in, exchange, for, other, advantages, which, you, have, in, your, power, then, if, this, reasoning, be, true, why, stipulate, for, the, uti, possidetis, you, can, get, no, territory, indeed, the, state, of, your, military, operations, however, creditable, does, not, entitle, you, to, demand, any, he, was,

of, the, british, german, army, and, their, allied, dutch, all, stationed, alongside, the, prussian, forces, of, generalfeldmarschall, gebhard, leberecht, von, bl, cher, napoleon, s, strategy, was, to, isolate, the, allied, and, prussian, armies, and, annihilate, each, one, separately, before, the, austrians, and, russians, arrived, in, doing, so, the, vast, superiority, in, numbers, of, the, coalition, would, be, greatly, diminished, he, would, then, seek, the, possibility, of, peace, with, austria, and, russia, the, french, invaded, the, netherlands, with, napoleon, defeating, the, prussians, at, ligny, and, marshal, ney, engaging, indecisively, with, wellington, at, the, battle, of, quatre, bras, the, prussians, retreated, 18, miles, north, to, wavre, whilst, wellington, s, anglo, allied, army, withdrew, 15, miles, north, to, a, site, he, had, noted, the, previous, year, as, favourable, for, a, battle, the, north, ridge, of, a, shallow, valley, on, the, brussels, road, just, south, of, the, small, town, of, waterloo, on, 17, june, there, was, torrential, rain, which, severely, hampered, movement, and, had, a, considerable, effect, the, next, day, 18, june, when, the, battle, of, waterloo, was, fought, this, was, the, first, time, wellington, had, encountered, napoleon, he, commanded, an, anglo, dutch, german, army, that, consisted, of, approximately, 73, 000, troops, 26, 000, of, whom, were, british, approximately, 30, percent, of, that, 26, 000, were, irish, the, battle, of, waterloo, was, fought, on, sunday, 18, june, 1815, near, waterloo, at, that, time, in, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, now, in, belgium, it, commenced, with, a, diversionary, attack, on, hougoumont, by, a, division, of, french, soldiers, after, a, barrage, of, 80, cannons, the, first, french, infantry, attack, was, launched, by, comte, d, erlon, s, i, corps, d, erlon, s, troops, advanced, through, the, allied, centre, resulting, in, allied, troops, in, front, of, the, ridge, retreating, in, disorder, through, the, main, position, d, erlon, s, corps, stormed, the, most, fortified, allied, position, la, haye, sainte, but, failed, to, take, it, an, allied, division, under, thomas, picton, met, the, remainder, of, d, erlon, s, corps, head, to, head, engaging, them, in, an, infantry, duel, in, which, picton, was, killed, during, this, struggle, lord, uxbridge, launched, two, of, his, cavalry, brigades, at, the, enemy, catching, the, french, infantry, off, guard, driving, them, to, the, bottom, of, the, slope, and, capturing, two, french, imperial, eagles, the, charge, however, over, reached, itself, and, the, british, cavalry, crushed, by, fresh, french, horsemen, sent, at, them, by, napoleon, were, driven, back, suffering, tremendous, losses, shortly, before, 16, 00, marshal, ney, noted, an, apparent, withdrawal, from, wellington, s, centre, he, mistook, the, movement, of, casualties, to, the, rear, for, the, beginnings, of, a, retreat, and, sought, to, exploit, it, ney, at, this, time, had, few, infantry, reserves, left, as, most, of, the, infantry, had, been, committed, either, to, the, futile, hougoumont, attack, or, to, the, defence, of, the, french, right, ney, therefore, tried, to, break, wellington, s, centre, with, a, cavalry, charge, alone, at, about, 16, 30, the, first, prussian, corps, arrived, commanded, by, freiherr, von, b, low, iv, corps, arrived, as, the, french, cavalry, attack, was, in, full, spate, b, low, sent, the, 15th, brigade, to, link, up, with, wellington, s, left, flank, in, the, frichermont, la, haie, area, while, the, brigade, s, horse, artillery, battery, and, additional, brigade, artillery, deployed, to, its, left, in, support, napoleon, sent, lobau, s, corps, to, intercept, the, rest, of, b, low, s, iv, corps, proceeding, to, plancenoit, the, 15th, brigade, sent, lobau, s, corps, into, retreat, to, the, plancenoit, area, von, hiller, s, 16th, brigade, also, pushed, forward, with, six, battalions, against, plancenoit, napoleon, had, dispatched, all, eight, battalions, of, the, young, guard, to, reinforce, lobau, who, was, now, seriously, pressed, by, the, enemy, napoleon, s, young, guard, counter, attacked, and, after, very, hard, fighting, secured, plancenoit, but, were, themselves, counter, attacked, and, driven, out, napoleon, then, resorted, to, sending, two, battalions, of, the, middle, and, old, guard, into, plancenoit, and, after, ferocious, fighting, they, recaptured, the, village, the, french, cavalry, attacked, the, british, infantry, squares, many, times, each, at, a, heavy, cost, to, the, french, but, with, few, british, casualties, ney, himself, was, displaced, from, his, horse, four, times, eventually, it, became, obvious, even, to, ney, that, cavalry, alone, were, achieving, little, belatedly, he, organised, a, combined, arms, attack, using, bachelu, s, division, and, tissot, s, regiment, of, foy, s, division, from, reille, s, ii, corps, plus, those, french, cavalry, that, remained, in, a, fit, state, to, fight, this, assault, was, directed, along, much, the, same, route, as, the, previous, heavy, cavalry, attacks, meanwhile, at, approximately, the, same, time, as, ney, s, combined, arms, assault, on, the, centre, right, of, wellington, s, line, napoleon, ordered, ney, to, capture, la, haye, sainte, at, whatever, the, cost, ney, accomplished, this, with, what, was, left, of, d, erlon, s, corps, soon, after, 18, 00, ney, then, moved, horse, artillery, up, towards, wellington, s, centre, and, began, to, attack, the, infantry, squares, at, short, range, with, canister, this, all, but, destroyed, the, 27th, inniskilling, regiment, and, the, 30th, and, 73rd, regiments, suffered, such, heavy, losses, that, they, had, to, combine, to, form, a, viable, square, wellington, s, centre, was, now, on, the, verge, of, collapse, and, wide, open, to, an, attack, from, the, french, luckily, for, wellington, pirch, i, s, and, zieten, s, corps, of, the, prussian, army, were, now, at, hand, zieten, s, corps, permitted, the, two, fresh, cavalry, brigades, of, vivian, and, vandeleur, on, wellington, s, extreme, left, to, be, moved, and, posted, behind, the, depleted, centre, pirch, i, corps, then, proceeded, to, support, b, low, and, together, they, regained, possession, of, plancenoit, and, once, more, the, charleroi, road, was, swept, by, prussian, round, shot, the, value, of, this, reinforcement, is, held, in, high, regard, the, french, army, now, fiercely, attacked, the, coalition, all, along, the, line, with, the, culminating, point, being, reached, when, napoleon, sent, forward, the, imperial, guard, at, 19, 30, the, attack, of, the, imperial, guards, was, mounted, by, five, battalions, of, the, middle, guard, and, not, by, the, grenadiers, or, chasseurs, of, the, old, guard, marching, through, a, hail, of, canister, and, skirmisher, fire, and, severely, outnumbered, the, 3, 000, or, so, middle, guardsmen, advanced, to, the, west, of, la, haye, sainte, and, proceeded, to, separate, into, three, distinct, attack, forces, one, consisting, of, two, battalions, of, grenadiers, defeated, the, coalition, s, first, line, and, marched, on, chass, s, relatively, fresh, dutch, division, was, sent, against, them, and, allied, artillery, fired, into, the, victorious, grenadiers, flank, this, still, could, not, stop, the, guard, s, advance, so, chass, ordered, his, first, brigade, to, charge, the, outnumbered, french, who, faltered, and, broke, further, to, the, west, 1, 500, british, foot, guards, under, maitland, were, lying, down, to, protect, themselves, from, the, french, artillery, as, two, battalions, of, chasseurs, approached, the, second, prong, of, the, imperial, guard, s, attack, maitland, s, guardsmen, rose, and, devastated, them, with, point, blank, volleys, the, chasseurs, deployed, to, counter, attack, but, began, to, waver, a, bayonet, charge, by, the, foot, guards, then, broke, them, the, third, prong, a, fresh, chasseur, battalion, now, came, up, in, support, the, british, guardsmen, retreated, with, these, chasseurs, in, pursuit, but, the, latter, were, halted, as, the, 52nd, light, infantry, wheeled, in, line, onto, their, flank, and, poured, a, devastating, fire, into, them, and, then, charged, under, this, onslaught, they, too, broke, the, last, of, the, guard, retreated, headlong, mass, panic, ensued, through, the, french, lines, as, the, news, spread, la, garde, recule, sauve, qui, peut, the, guard, is, retreating, every, man, for, himself, wellington, then, stood, up, in, copenhagen, s, stirrups, and, waved, his, hat, in, the, air, to, signal, an, advance, of, the, allied, line, just, as, the, prussians, were, overrunning, the, french, positions, to, the, east, what, remained, of, the, french, army, then, abandoned, the, field, in, disorder, wellington, and, bl, cher, met, at, the, inn, of, la, belle, alliance, on, the, north, south, road, which, bisected, the, battlefield, and, it, was, agreed, that, the, prussians, should, pursue, the, retreating, french, army, back, to, france, the, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, on, 20, november, 1815, after, the, victory, the, duke, supported, proposals, that, a, medal, be, awarded, to, all, british, soldiers, who, participated, in, the, waterloo, campaign, and, on, 28, june, 1815, he, wrote, to, the, duke, of, york, suggesting, the, expediency, of, giving, to, the, non, commissioned, officers, and, soldiers, engaged, in, the, battle, of, waterloo, a, medal, i, am, convinced, it, would, have, the, best, effect, in, the, army, and, if, the, battle, should, settle, our, concerns, they, will, well, deserve, it, the, waterloo, medal, was, duly, authorised, and, distributed, to, all, ranks, in, 1816, much, historical, discussion, has, been, made, about, napoleon, s, decision, to, send, 33, 000, troops, under, marshal, grouchy, to, intercept, the, prussians, but, having, defeated, bl, cher, at, ligny, on, 16, june, and, forced, the, allies, to, retreat, in, divergent, directions, napoleon, may, have, been, strategically, astute, in, a, judgement, that, he, would, have, been, unable, to, beat, the, combined, allied, forces, on, one, battlefield, wellington, s, comparable, strategic, gamble, was, to, leave, 17, 000, troops, and, artillery, mostly, dutch, 8, 1, mi, 13, 0, km, away, at, hal, north, west, of, mont, saint, jean, in, case, of, a, french, advance, up, the, mons, hal, brussels, road, the, campaign, led, to, numerous, other, controversies, issues, concerning, wellington, s, troop, dispositions, prior, to, napoleon, s, invasion, of, the, netherlands, whether, wellington, misled, or, betrayed, bl, cher, by, promising, then, failing, to, come, directly, to, bl, cher, s, aid, at, ligny, and, credit, for, the, victory, between, wellington, and, the, prussians, these, and, other, such, issues, concerning, bl, cher, s, wellington, s, and, napoleon, s, decisions, during, the, campaign, were, the, subject, of, a, strategic, level, study, by, the, prussian, political, military, theorist, carl, von, clausewitz, feldzug, von, 1815, strategische, uebersicht, des, feldzugs, von, 1815, english, title, the, campaign, of, 1815, strategic, overview, of, the, campaign, this, study, was, clausewitz, s, last, such, work, and, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, best, example, of, clausewitz, s, mature, theories, concerning, such, analyses, it, attracted, the, attention, of, wellington, s, staff, who, prompted, the, duke, to, write, a, published, essay, on, the, campaign, other, than, his, immediate, official, after, action, report, the, waterloo, dispatch, this, was, published, as, the, 1842, memorandum, on, the, battle, of, waterloo, while, wellington, disputed, clausewitz, on, several, points, clausewitz, largely, absolved, wellington, of, accusations, levelled, against, him, this, exchange, with, clausewitz, was, quite, famous, in, britain, in, the, 19th, century, particularly, in, charles, cornwallis, chesney, s, work, the, waterloo, lectures, but, was, largely, ignored, in, the, 20th, century, due, to, hostilities, between, britain, and, germany, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, wellington, was, appointed, commander, of, the, multi, national, army, of, occupation, based, in, paris, the, army, consisted, of, troops, from, the, united, kingdom, austria, russia, and, prussia, along, with, contributions, from, five, smaller, european, states, although, the, various, contingents, were, administered, by, their, own, commanders, they, were, all, subordinated, to, wellington, who, was, also, responsible, for, liaison, with, the, french, administration, the, role, of, the, army, was, to, prevent, a, resurgence, of, french, aggression, and, to, allow, the, restored, king, louis, xviii, to, consolidate, his, control, over, the, country, the, army, of, occupation, was, never, required, to, intervene, militarily, and, was, dissolved, in, 1818, after, which, wellington, returned, to, britain, it, was, his, last, active, military, command, wellington, entered, politics, again, when, he, was, appointed, master, general, of, the, ordnance, in, the, tory, government, of, lord, liverpool, on, 26, december, 1818, he, also, became, governor, of, plymouth, on, 9, october, 1819, he, was, appointed, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, army, on, 22, january, 1827, and, constable, of, the, tower, of, london, on, 5, february, 1827, along, with, robert, peel, wellington, became, an, increasingly, influential, member, of, the, tory, party, and, in, 1828, he, resigned, as, commander, in, chief, and, became, prime, minister, during, his, first, seven, months, as, prime, minister, he, chose, not, to, live, in, the, official, residence, at, 10, downing, street, finding, it, too, small, he, moved, in, only, because, his, own, home, apsley, house, required, extensive, renovations, during, this, time, he, was, largely, instrumental, in, the, foundation, of, king, s, college, london, on, 20, january, 1829, wellington, was, appointed, lord, warden, of, the, cinque, ports, his, term, was, marked, by, roman, catholic, emancipation, the, restoration, of, most, civil, rights, to, roman, catholics, in, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, change, was, prompted, by, the, landslide, by, election, win, of, daniel, o, connell, a, roman, catholic, irish, proponent, of, emancipation, who, was, elected, despite, not, being, legally, allowed, to, sit, in, parliament, in, the, house, of, lords, facing, stiff, opposition, wellington, spoke, for, catholic, emancipation, and, according, to, some, sources, gave, one, of, the, best, speeches, of, his, career, wellington, was, born, in, ireland, and, so, had, some, understanding, of, the, grievances, of, the, roman, catholic, majority, there, as, chief, secretary, he, had, given, an, undertaking, that, the, remaining, penal, laws, would, only, be, enforced, as, mildly, as, possible, in, 1811, catholic, soldiers, were, given, freedom, of, worship, and, 18, years, later, the, roman, catholic, relief, act, 1829, was, passed, with, a, majority, of, 105, many, tories, voted, against, the, act, and, it, passed, only, with, the, help, of, the, whigs, wellington, had, threatened, to, resign, as, prime, minister, if, king, george, iv, did, not, give, royal, assent, the, earl, of, winchilsea, accused, the, duke, of, an, insidious, design, for, the, infringement, of, our, liberties, and, the, introduction, of, popery, into, every, department, of, the, state, wellington, responded, by, immediately, challenging, winchilsea, to, a, duel, on, 21, march, 1829, wellington, and, winchilsea, met, on, battersea, fields, when, the, time, came, to, fire, the, duke, took, aim, and, winchilsea, kept, his, arm, down, the, duke, fired, wide, to, the, right, accounts, differ, as, to, whether, he, missed, on, purpose, an, act, known, in, duelling, as, a, delope, wellington, claimed, he, did, however, he, was, noted, for, his, poor, aim, and, reports, more, sympathetic, to, winchilsea, claimed, he, had, aimed, to, kill, winchilsea, discharged, his, pistol, into, the, air, a, plan, he, and, his, second, had, almost, certainly, decided, upon, before, the, duel, honour, was, saved, and, winchilsea, wrote, wellington, an, apology, the, nickname, iron, duke, originated, from, this, period, when, he, experienced, a, high, degree, of, personal, and, political, unpopularity, its, repeated, use, in, freeman, s, journal, throughout, june, 1830, appears, to, bear, reference, to, his, resolute, political, will, with, taints, of, disapproval, from, its, irish, editors, during, this, time, wellington, was, greeted, by, a, hostile, reaction, from, the, crowds, at, the, opening, of, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, wellington, s, government, fell, in, 1830, in, the, summer, and, autumn, of, that, year, a, wave, of, riots, swept, the, country, the, whigs, had, been, out, of, power, for, most, years, since, the, 1770s, and, saw, political, reform, in, response, to, the, unrest, as, the, key, to, their, return, wellington, stuck, to, the, tory, policy, of, no, reform, and, no, expansion, of, suffrage, and, as, a, result, lost, a, vote, of, no, confidence, on, 15, november, 1830, the, whigs, introduced, the, first, reform, bill, while, wellington, and, the, tories, worked, to, prevent, its, passage, the, whigs, could, not, get, the, bill, past, its, second, reading, in, the, british, house, of, commons, and, the, attempt, failed, an, election, followed, in, direct, response, and, the, whigs, were, returned, with, a, landslide, majority, a, second, reform, act, was, introduced, and, passed, in, the, house, of, commons, but, was, defeated, in, the, tory, controlled, house, of, lords, another, wave, of, near, insurrection, swept, the, country, wellington, s, residence, at, apsley, house, was, targeted, by, a, mob, of, demonstrators, on, 27, april, 1831, and, again, on, 12, october, leaving, his, windows, smashed, iron, shutters, were, installed, in, june, 1832, to, prevent, further, damage, by, crowds, angry, over, rejection, of, the, reform, bill, which, he, strongly, opposed, the, whig, government, fell, in, 1832, and, wellington, was, unable, to, form, a, tory, government, partly, because, of, a, run, on, the, bank, of, england, this, left, king, william, iv, no, choice, but, to, restore, earl, grey, to, the, premiership, eventually, the, bill, passed, the, house, of, lords, after, the, king, threatened, to, fill, that, house, with, newly, created, whig, peers, if, it, were, not, wellington, was, never, reconciled, to, the, change, when, parliament, first, met, after, the, first, election, under, the, widened, franchise, wellington, is, reported, to, have, said, i, never, saw, so, many, shocking, bad, hats, in, my, life, wellington, opposed, the, jewish, civil, disabilities, repeal, bill, and, he, stated, in, parliament, on, 1, august, 1833, that, england, is, a, christian, country, and, a, christian, legislature, and, that, the, effect, of, this, measure, would, be, to, remove, that, peculiar, character, the, bill, was, defeated, by, 104, votes, to, 54, wellington, was, gradually, superseded, as, leader, of, the, tories, by, robert, peel, while, the, party, evolved, into, the, conservatives, when, the, tories, were, returned, to, power, in, 1834, wellington, declined, to, become, prime, minister, because, he, thought, membership, in, the, house, of, commons, had, become, essential, the, king, reluctantly, approved, peel, who, was, in, italy, hence, wellington, acted, as, interim, leader, for, three, weeks, in, november, and, december, 1834, taking, the, responsibilities, of, prime, minister, and, most, of, the, other, ministries, in, peel, s, first, cabinet, 1834, 1835, wellington, became, foreign, secretary, while, in, the, second, 1841, 1846, he, was, a, minister, without, portfolio, and, leader, of, the, house, of, lords, wellington, was, also, re, appointed, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, army, on, 15, august, 1842, following, the, resignation, of, lord, hill, wellington, served, as, the, leader, of, the, conservative, party, in, the, house, of, lords, from, 1828, to, 1846, some, historians, have, belittled, him, as, a, befuddled, reactionary, but, a, consensus, in, the, late, 20th, century, depicts, him, as, a, shrewd, operator, who, hid, his, cleverness, behind, the, fa, ade, of, a, poorly, informed, old, soldier, wellington, worked, to, transform, the, lords, from, unstinting, support, of, the, crown, to, an, active, player, in, political, manoeuvering, with, a, commitment, to, the, landed, aristocracy, he, used, his, london, residence, as, a, venue, for, intimate, dinners, and, private, consultations, together, with, extensive, correspondence, that, kept, him, in, close, touch, with, party, leaders, in, the, commons, and, the, main, persona, in, the, lords, he, gave, public, rhetorical, support, to, ultra, tory, anti, reform, positions, but, then, deftly, changed, positions, toward, the, party, s, centre, especially, when, peel, needed, support, from, the, upper, house, wellington, s, success, was, based, on, the, 44, elected, peers, from, scotland, and, ireland, whose, elections, he, controlled, wellesley, was, married, by, his, brother, gerald, a, clergyman, to, kitty, pakenham, in, st, george, s, church, dublin, on, 10, april, 1806, they, had, two, children, arthur, was, born, in, 1807, and, charles, was, born, in, 1808, the, marriage, proved, unsatisfactory, and, the, two, spent, years, apart, while, wellesley, was, campaigning, and, afterwards, kitty, grew, depressed, and, wellesley, pursued, other, sexual, and, romantic, partners, the, couple, largely, lived, apart, with, kitty, spending, most, of, her, time, at, their, country, home, stratfield, saye, house, and, wellesley, at, their, london, home, apsley, house, kitty, s, brother, edward, pakenham, served, under, wellesley, throughout, the, peninsular, war, and, wellesley, s, regard, for, him, helped, to, smooth, his, relations, with, kitty, until, pakenham, s, death, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, in, 1815, wellington, retired, from, political, life, in, 1846, although, he, remained, commander, in, chief, and, returned, briefly, to, the, public, eye, in, 1848, when, he, helped, organise, a, military, force, to, protect, london, during, the, year, of, european, revolution, the, conservative, party, had, split, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, with, wellington, and, most, of, the, former, cabinet, still, supporting, peel, but, most, of, the, mps, led, by, lord, derby, supporting, a, protectionist, stance, early, in, 1852, wellington, by, then, very, deaf, gave, derby, s, first, government, its, nickname, by, shouting, who, who, as, the, list, of, inexperienced, cabinet, ministers, was, read, out, in, the, house, of, lords, he, became, chief, ranger, and, keeper, of, hyde, park, and, st, james, s, park, on, 31, august, 1850, he, remained, colonel, of, the, 33rd, regiment, of, foot, from, 1, february, 1806, and, colonel, of, the, grenadier, guards, from, 22, january, 1827, kitty, died, of, cancer, in, 1831, despite, their, generally, unhappy, relations, which, had, led, to, an, effective, separation, wellington, was, said, to, have, been, greatly, saddened, by, her, death, his, one, comfort, being, that, after, half, a, lifetime, together, they, had, come, to, understand, each, other, at, the, end, he, had, found, consolation, for, his, unhappy, marriage, in, his, warm, friendship, with, the, diarist, harriet, arbuthnot, wife, of, his, colleague, charles, arbuthnot, harriet, s, death, in, the, cholera, epidemic, of, 1834, was, almost, as, great, a, blow, to, wellington, as, it, was, to, her, husband, the, two, widowers, spent, their, last, years, together, at, apsley, house, wellington, died, at, walmer, castle, in, kent, his, residence, as, lord, warden, of, the, cinque, ports, and, reputedly, his, favourite, home, on, 14, september, 1852, he, was, found, to, be, unwell, on, that, morning, and, was, helped, from, his, campaign, bed, which, he, had, used, throughout, his, military, career, and, seated, in, his, chair, where, he, died, his, death, was, recorded, as, being, due, to, the,

bed, reflecting, his, lack, of, regard, for, creature, comforts, general, miguel, de, lava, complained, that, wellington, said, so, often, that, the, army, would, march, at, daybreak, and, dine, on, cold, meat, that, he, began, to, dread, those, two, phrases, while, on, campaign, he, seldom, ate, anything, between, breakfast, and, dinner, during, the, retreat, to, portugal, in, 1811, he, subsisted, on, cold, meat, and, bread, to, the, despair, of, his, staff, who, dined, with, him, he, was, however, renowned, for, the, quality, of, the, wine, that, he, drank, and, served, often, drinking, a, bottle, with, his, dinner, not, a, great, quantity, by, the, standards, of, his, day, lava, was, a, witness, to, an, incident, just, before, the, battle, of, salamanca, wellington, was, eating, a, chicken, leg, while, observing, the, manoeuvres, of, the, french, army, through, a, spyglass, he, spotted, an, overextension, in, the, french, left, flank, and, realised, that, he, could, launch, a, successful, attack, there, he, exclaimed, by, god, that, will, do, and, threw, the, drumstick, in, the, air, after, the, battle, of, toulouse, colonel, frederick, ponsonby, brought, him, the, news, of, napoleon, s, abdication, and, wellington, broke, into, an, impromptu, flamenco, dance, spinning, around, on, his, heels, and, clicking, his, fingers, military, historian, charles, dalton, recorded, that, after, a, hard, fought, battle, in, spain, a, young, officer, made, the, comment, i, am, going, to, dine, with, wellington, tonight, which, was, overheard, by, the, duke, as, he, rode, by, give, me, at, least, the, prefix, of, mr, before, my, name, wellington, said, my, lord, replied, the, officer, we, do, not, speak, of, mr, caesar, or, mr, alexander, so, why, should, i, speak, of, mr, wellington, while, known, for, his, stern, countenance, and, iron, handed, discipline, wellington, was, by, no, means, unfeeling, while, he, is, said, to, have, disapproved, of, soldiers, cheering, as, too, nearly, an, expression, of, opinion, wellington, nevertheless, cared, for, his, men, he, refused, to, pursue, the, french, after, the, battles, of, porto, and, salamanca, foreseeing, an, inevitable, cost, to, his, army, in, chasing, a, diminished, enemy, through, rough, terrain, the, only, time, that, he, ever, showed, grief, in, public, was, after, the, storming, of, badajoz, he, cried, at, the, sight, of, the, british, dead, in, the, breaches, in, this, context, his, famous, despatch, after, the, battle, of, vitoria, calling, them, the, scum, of, the, earth, can, be, seen, to, be, fuelled, as, much, by, disappointment, at, their, breaking, ranks, as, by, anger, he, shed, tears, after, waterloo, on, the, presentation, of, the, list, of, british, fallen, by, john, hume, later, with, his, family, unwilling, to, be, congratulated, for, his, victory, he, broke, down, in, tears, his, fighting, spirit, diminished, by, the, high, cost, of, the, battle, and, great, personal, loss, wellington, s, soldier, servant, a, gruff, german, called, beckerman, and, his, long, serving, valet, james, kendall, who, served, him, for, 25, years, and, was, with, him, when, he, died, were, both, devoted, to, him, a, story, that, he, never, spoke, to, his, servants, and, preferred, instead, to, write, his, orders, on, a, notepad, on, his, dressing, table, in, fact, probably, refers, to, his, son, the, 2nd, duke, it, was, recorded, by, the, 3rd, duke, s, niece, viva, seton, montgomerie, 1879, 1959, as, being, an, anecdote, she, heard, from, an, old, retainer, charles, holman, who, was, said, greatly, to, resemble, napoleon, following, an, incident, when, as, master, general, of, the, ordnance, he, had, been, close, to, a, large, explosion, wellington, began, to, experience, deafness, and, other, ear, related, problems, in, 1822, a, botched, operation, on, his, left, ear, led, to, permanent, deafness, on, that, side, and, some, contemporaries, suggested, that, he, never, fully, recovered, his, health, wellington, came, to, enjoy, the, company, of, a, variety, of, intellectual, and, attractive, women, and, had, many, amorous, liaisons, particularly, after, the, battle, of, waterloo, and, his, subsequent, ambassadorial, position, in, paris, in, the, days, following, waterloo, he, had, an, affair, with, the, notorious, lady, caroline, lamb, sister, of, one, of, his, severely, wounded, officers, and, favourites, col, frederick, ponsonby, he, corresponded, for, many, years, with, lady, georgiana, lennox, later, lady, de, ros, 26, years, his, junior, and, daughter, of, the, duchess, of, richmond, who, held, the, famous, ball, on, the, eve, of, waterloo, and, though, there, are, hints, it, has, not, been, clearly, determined, if, the, relationship, was, ever, sexual, the, british, press, lampooned, the, amorous, side, of, the, national, hero, in, 1824, one, liaison, came, back, to, haunt, him, when, wellington, received, a, letter, from, a, publisher, john, joseph, stockdale, offering, to, refrain, from, issuing, an, edition, of, the, rather, racy, memoirs, of, one, of, his, mistresses, harriette, wilson, in, exchange, for, money, it, is, said, that, the, duke, promptly, returned, the, letter, after, scrawling, across, it, publish, and, be, damned, however, hibbert, notes, in, his, biography, that, the, letter, can, be, found, among, the, duke, s, papers, with, nothing, written, on, it, it, is, certain, that, wellington, did, reply, and, the, tone, of, a, further, letter, from, the, publisher, quoted, by, longford, suggests, that, he, had, refused, in, the, strongest, language, to, submit, to, blackmail, he, was, also, a, remarkably, practical, man, who, spoke, concisely, in, 1851, it, was, discovered, that, there, were, a, great, many, sparrows, flying, about, in, the, crystal, palace, just, before, the, great, exhibition, was, to, open, his, advice, to, queen, victoria, was, sparrowhawks, ma, am, wellington, has, often, been, portrayed, as, a, defensive, general, even, though, many, perhaps, most, of, his, battles, were, offensive, argaum, assaye, oporto, salamanca, vitoria, toulouse, however, for, most, of, the, peninsular, war, where, he, earned, his, fame, his, army, lacked, the, numbers, for, a, strategically, offensive, posture, the, iron, duke, related, to, wellington, s, political, rather, than, to, his, military, career, its, use, is, often, disparaging, it, is, possible, the, term, became, more, commonly, used, after, 1832, when, wellington, had, metal, shutters, installed, at, apsley, house, to, prevent, rioters, breaking, the, windows, the, term, may, have, been, made, increasingly, popular, by, punch, cartoons, published, in, 1844, 45, in, popular, ballads, of, the, day, wellington, was, called, nosey, or, old, nosey, more, complimentary, sobriquets, including, the, beau, and, beau, douro, referenced, his, noted, dress, sense, spanish,
