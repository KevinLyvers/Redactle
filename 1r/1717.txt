alfred, russel, wallace, om, frs, 8, january, 1823, 7, november, 1913, was, an, english, naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, biologist, and, illustrator, he, independently, conceived, the, theory, of, evolution, through, natural, selection, his, 1858, paper, on, the, subject, was, published, that, year, alongside, extracts, from, charles, darwin, s, earlier, writings, on, the, topic, it, spurred, darwin, to, set, aside, the, big, species, book, he, was, drafting, and, quickly, write, an, abstract, of, it, which, was, published, in, 1859, as, on, the, origin, of, species, wallace, did, extensive, fieldwork, starting, in, the, amazon, river, basin, he, then, did, fieldwork, in, the, malay, archipelago, where, he, identified, the, faunal, divide, now, termed, the, wallace, line, which, separates, the, indonesian, archipelago, into, two, distinct, parts, a, western, portion, in, which, the, animals, are, largely, of, asian, origin, and, an, eastern, portion, where, the, fauna, reflect, australasia, he, was, considered, the, 19th, century, s, leading, expert, on, the, geographical, distribution, of, animal, species, and, is, sometimes, called, the, father, of, biogeography, or, more, specifically, of, zoogeography, wallace, was, one, of, the, leading, evolutionary, thinkers, of, the, 19th, century, working, on, warning, coloration, in, animals, and, reinforcement, sometimes, known, as, the, wallace, effect, a, way, that, natural, selection, could, contribute, to, speciation, by, encouraging, the, development, of, barriers, against, hybridisation, wallace, s, 1904, book, man, s, place, in, the, universe, was, the, first, serious, attempt, by, a, biologist, to, evaluate, the, likelihood, of, life, on, other, planets, he, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, write, a, serious, exploration, of, whether, there, was, life, on, mars, aside, from, scientific, work, he, was, a, social, activist, critical, of, what, he, considered, to, be, an, unjust, social, and, economic, system, in, 19th, century, britain, his, advocacy, of, spiritualism, and, his, belief, in, a, non, material, origin, for, the, higher, mental, faculties, of, humans, strained, his, relationship, with, other, scientists, he, was, one, of, the, first, prominent, scientists, to, raise, concerns, over, the, environmental, impact, of, human, activity, he, wrote, prolifically, on, both, scientific, and, social, issues, his, account, of, his, adventures, and, observations, during, his, explorations, in, southeast, asia, the, malay, archipelago, was, first, published, in, 1869, it, continues, to, be, both, popular, and, highly, regarded, alfred, russel, wallace, was, born, on, 8, january, 1823, in, llanbadoc, monmouthshire, he, was, the, eighth, of, nine, children, born, to, mary, anne, wallace, n, e, greenell, and, thomas, vere, wallace, his, mother, was, english, while, his, father, was, of, scottish, ancestry, his, family, claimed, a, connection, to, william, wallace, a, leader, of, scottish, forces, during, the, wars, of, scottish, independence, in, the, 13th, century, wallace, s, father, graduated, in, law, but, never, practised, it, he, owned, some, income, generating, property, but, bad, investments, and, failed, business, ventures, resulted, in, a, steady, deterioration, of, the, family, s, financial, position, wallace, s, mother, was, from, a, middle, class, family, of, hertford, to, which, place, his, family, moved, when, wallace, was, five, years, old, he, attended, hertford, grammar, school, until, 1837, when, he, reached, the, age, of, 14, the, normal, leaving, age, for, a, pupil, not, going, on, to, university, wallace, then, moved, to, london, to, board, with, his, older, brother, john, a, 19, year, old, apprentice, builder, this, was, a, stopgap, measure, until, william, his, oldest, brother, was, ready, to, take, him, on, as, an, apprentice, surveyor, while, in, london, alfred, attended, lectures, and, read, books, at, the, london, mechanics, institute, here, he, was, exposed, to, the, radical, political, ideas, of, the, welsh, social, reformer, robert, owen, and, of, the, english, born, political, theorist, thomas, paine, he, left, london, in, 1837, to, live, with, william, and, work, as, his, apprentice, for, six, years, they, moved, repeatedly, to, different, places, in, mid, wales, then, at, the, end, of, 1839, they, moved, to, kington, herefordshire, near, the, welsh, border, before, eventually, settling, at, neath, in, wales, between, 1840, and, 1843, wallace, worked, as, a, land, surveyor, in, the, countryside, of, the, west, of, england, and, wales, the, natural, history, of, his, surroundings, aroused, his, interest, from, 1841, he, collected, flowers, and, plants, as, an, amateur, botanist, one, result, of, wallace, s, early, travels, is, a, modern, controversy, about, his, nationality, since, he, was, born, in, monmouthshire, some, sources, have, considered, him, to, be, welsh, other, historians, have, questioned, this, because, neither, of, his, parents, were, welsh, his, family, only, briefly, lived, in, monmouthshire, the, welsh, people, wallace, knew, in, his, childhood, considered, him, to, be, english, and, because, he, consistently, referred, to, himself, as, english, rather, than, welsh, one, wallace, scholar, has, stated, that, the, most, reasonable, interpretation, is, therefore, that, he, was, an, englishman, born, in, wales, in, 1843, wallace, s, father, died, and, a, decline, in, demand, for, surveying, meant, william, s, business, no, longer, had, work, available, for, a, short, time, wallace, was, unemployed, then, early, in, 1844, he, was, engaged, by, the, collegiate, school, in, leicester, to, teach, drawing, mapmaking, and, surveying, he, had, already, read, george, combe, s, the, constitution, of, man, and, after, spencer, hall, lectured, on, mesmerism, wallace, as, well, as, some, of, the, older, pupils, tried, it, out, wallace, spent, many, hours, at, the, town, library, in, leicester, he, read, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, by, thomas, robert, malthus, alexander, von, humboldt, s, personal, narrative, darwin, s, journal, the, voyage, of, the, beagle, and, charles, lyell, s, principles, of, geology, one, evening, wallace, met, the, entomologist, henry, bates, who, was, 19, years, old, and, had, published, an, 1843, paper, on, beetles, in, the, journal, zoologist, he, befriended, wallace, and, started, him, collecting, insects, when, wallace, s, brother, william, died, in, march, 1845, wallace, left, his, teaching, position, to, assume, control, of, his, brother, s, firm, in, neath, but, his, brother, john, and, he, were, unable, to, make, the, business, work, after, a, few, months, he, found, work, as, a, civil, engineer, for, a, nearby, firm, that, was, working, on, a, survey, for, a, proposed, railway, in, the, vale, of, neath, wallace, s, work, on, the, survey, was, largely, outdoors, in, the, countryside, allowing, him, to, indulge, his, new, passion, for, collecting, insects, wallace, persuaded, his, brother, john, to, join, him, in, starting, another, architecture, and, civil, engineering, firm, it, carried, out, projects, including, the, design, of, a, building, for, the, neath, mechanics, institute, founded, in, 1843, during, this, period, he, exchanged, letters, with, bates, about, books, by, the, end, of, 1845, wallace, was, convinced, by, robert, chambers, s, anonymously, published, treatise, on, progressive, development, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, but, he, found, bates, was, more, critical, wallace, re, read, darwin, s, journal, and, on, 11, april, 1846, wrote, as, the, journal, of, a, scientific, traveller, it, is, second, only, to, humboldt, s, personal, narrative, as, a, work, of, general, interest, perhaps, superior, to, it, william, jevons, the, founder, of, the, neath, institute, was, impressed, by, wallace, and, persuaded, him, to, give, lectures, there, on, science, and, engineering, in, the, autumn, of, 1846, wallace, and, his, brother, john, purchased, a, cottage, near, neath, where, they, lived, with, their, mother, and, sister, fanny, inspired, by, the, chronicles, of, earlier, and, contemporary, travelling, naturalists, wallace, decided, to, travel, abroad, he, later, wrote, that, darwin, s, journal, and, humboldt, s, personal, narrative, were, the, two, works, to, whose, inspiration, i, owe, my, determination, to, visit, the, tropics, as, a, collector, after, reading, a, voyage, up, the, river, amazon, by, william, henry, edwards, wallace, and, bates, estimated, that, by, collecting, and, selling, natural, history, specimens, such, as, birds, and, insects, they, could, meet, their, costs, with, the, prospect, of, good, profits, they, therefore, engaged, as, their, agent, samuel, stevens, who, would, advertise, and, arrange, sales, to, institutions, and, private, collectors, for, a, commission, of, 20, on, sales, plus, 5, on, despatching, freight, and, remittances, of, money, in, 1848, wallace, and, bates, left, for, brazil, aboard, the, mischief, they, intended, to, collect, insects, and, other, animal, specimens, in, the, amazon, rainforest, for, their, private, collections, selling, the, duplicates, to, museums, and, collectors, back, in, britain, to, fund, the, trip, wallace, hoped, to, gather, evidence, of, the, transmutation, of, species, bates, and, he, spent, most, of, their, first, year, collecting, near, bel, m, then, explored, inland, separately, occasionally, meeting, to, discuss, their, findings, in, 1849, they, were, briefly, joined, by, another, young, explorer, the, botanist, richard, spruce, along, with, wallace, s, younger, brother, herbert, herbert, soon, left, dying, two, years, later, from, yellow, fever, but, spruce, like, bates, would, spend, over, ten, years, collecting, in, south, america, wallace, spent, four, years, charting, the, rio, negro, collecting, specimens, and, making, notes, on, the, peoples, and, languages, he, encountered, as, well, as, the, geography, flora, and, fauna, on, 12, july, 1852, wallace, embarked, for, the, uk, on, the, brig, helen, after, 25, days, at, sea, the, ship, s, cargo, caught, fire, and, the, crew, was, forced, to, abandon, ship, all, the, specimens, wallace, had, on, the, ship, mostly, collected, during, the, last, and, most, interesting, two, years, of, his, trip, were, lost, he, managed, to, save, a, few, notes, and, pencil, sketches, but, little, else, wallace, and, the, crew, spent, ten, days, in, an, open, boat, before, being, picked, up, by, the, brig, jordeson, which, was, sailing, from, cuba, to, london, the, jordeson, s, provisions, were, strained, by, the, unexpected, passengers, but, after, a, difficult, passage, on, short, rations, the, ship, reached, its, destination, on, 1, october, 1852, the, lost, collection, had, been, insured, for, 200, by, stevens, after, his, return, to, britain, wallace, spent, 18, months, in, london, living, on, the, insurance, payment, and, selling, a, few, specimens, that, had, been, shipped, home, during, this, period, despite, having, lost, almost, all, the, notes, from, his, south, american, expedition, he, wrote, six, academic, papers, including, on, the, monkeys, of, the, amazon, and, two, books, palm, trees, of, the, amazon, and, their, uses, and, travels, on, the, amazon, at, the, same, time, he, made, connections, with, several, other, british, naturalists, bates, and, others, were, collecting, in, the, amazon, area, wallace, was, more, interested, in, new, opportunities, in, the, malay, archipelago, as, demonstrated, by, the, travel, writings, of, ida, laura, pfeiffer, and, valuable, insect, specimens, she, collected, which, stevens, sold, as, her, agent, in, march, 1853, wallace, wrote, to, sir, james, brooke, rajah, of, sarawak, who, was, then, in, london, and, who, arranged, assistance, in, sarawak, for, wallace, in, june, wallace, wrote, to, murchison, at, the, royal, geographical, society, rgs, for, support, proposing, to, again, fund, his, exploring, entirely, from, sale, of, duplicate, collections, he, later, recalled, that, while, researching, in, the, insect, room, of, the, british, museum, he, was, introduced, to, darwin, and, they, had, a, few, minutes, conversation, after, presenting, a, paper, and, a, large, map, of, the, rio, negro, to, the, rgs, wallace, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, society, on, 27, february, 1854, free, passage, arranged, on, royal, navy, ships, was, stalled, by, the, crimean, war, but, eventually, the, rgs, funded, first, class, travel, by, p, o, steamships, wallace, and, a, young, assistant, charles, allen, embarked, at, southampton, on, 4, march, 1854, after, the, overland, journey, to, suez, and, another, change, of, ship, at, ceylon, they, disembarked, at, singapore, on, 19, april, 1854, from, 1854, to, 1862, wallace, travelled, around, the, islands, of, the, malay, archipelago, or, east, indies, now, singapore, malaysia, and, indonesia, his, main, objective, was, to, obtain, specimens, of, natural, history, both, for, my, private, collection, and, to, supply, duplicates, to, museums, and, amateurs, in, addition, to, allen, he, generally, employed, one, or, two, and, sometimes, three, malay, servants, as, assistants, and, paid, large, numbers, of, local, people, at, various, places, to, bring, specimens, his, total, was, 125, 660, specimens, most, of, which, were, insects, including, more, than, 83, 000, beetles, several, thousand, of, the, specimens, represented, species, new, to, science, overall, more, than, thirty, men, worked, for, him, at, some, stage, as, full, time, paid, collectors, he, also, hired, guides, porters, cooks, and, boat, crews, so, well, over, 100, individuals, worked, for, him, after, collecting, expeditions, to, bukit, timah, hill, in, singapore, and, to, malacca, wallace, and, allen, reached, sarawak, in, october, 1854, and, were, welcomed, at, kuching, by, sir, james, brooke, s, then, heir, captain, john, brooke, wallace, hired, a, malay, named, ali, as, a, general, servant, and, cook, and, spent, the, early, 1855, wet, season, in, a, small, dyak, house, at, the, foot, of, mount, santubong, overlooking, a, branch, outlet, of, the, sarawak, river, he, read, about, species, distribution, notes, on, pictets, s, palaeontology, and, wrote, his, sarawak, paper, in, march, he, moved, to, the, simunjon, coal, works, operated, by, the, borneo, company, under, ludvig, verner, helms, and, supplemented, collecting, by, paying, workers, a, cent, for, each, insect, a, specimen, of, the, previously, unknown, gliding, tree, frog, rhacophorus, nigropalmatus, now, called, wallace, s, flying, frog, came, from, a, chinese, workman, who, told, wallace, that, it, glided, down, local, people, also, assisted, with, shooting, orangutans, they, spent, time, with, sir, james, then, in, february, 1856, allen, chose, to, stay, on, with, the, missionaries, at, kuching, on, reaching, singapore, in, may, 1856, wallace, hired, a, bird, skinner, with, ali, as, cook, they, collected, for, two, days, on, bali, then, from, 17, june, to, 30, august, on, lombok, in, december, 1856, darwin, had, written, to, contacts, worldwide, to, get, specimens, for, his, continuing, research, into, variation, under, domestication, at, lombok, s, port, city, ampanam, wallace, wrote, telling, his, agent, stevens, about, specimens, shipped, including, a, domestic, duck, variety, for, mr, darwin, he, would, perhaps, also, like, the, jungle, cock, which, is, often, domesticated, here, is, doubtless, one, of, the, originals, of, the, domestic, breed, of, poultry, in, the, same, letter, wallace, said, birds, from, bali, and, lombok, divided, by, a, narrow, strait, belong, to, two, quite, distinct, zoological, provinces, of, which, they, form, the, extreme, limits, java, borneo, sumatra, and, malacca, and, australia, and, the, moluccas, stevens, arranged, publication, of, relevant, paragraphs, in, the, january, 1857, issue, of, the, zoologist, after, further, investigation, the, zoogeographical, boundary, eventually, became, known, as, the, wallace, line, ali, became, wallace, s, most, trusted, assistant, a, skilled, collector, and, researcher, wallace, collected, and, preserved, the, delicate, insect, specimens, while, most, of, the, birds, were, collected, and, prepared, by, his, assistants, of, those, ali, collected, and, prepared, around, 5000, while, exploring, the, archipelago, wallace, refined, his, thoughts, about, evolution, and, had, his, famous, insight, on, natural, selection, in, 1858, he, sent, an, article, outlining, his, theory, to, darwin, it, was, published, along, with, a, description, of, darwin, s, theory, that, same, year, accounts, of, wallace, s, studies, and, adventures, were, eventually, published, in, 1869, as, the, malay, archipelago, this, became, one, of, the, most, popular, books, of, scientific, exploration, of, the, 19th, century, and, has, never, been, out, of, print, it, was, praised, by, scientists, such, as, darwin, to, whom, the, book, was, dedicated, by, lyell, and, by, non, scientists, such, as, the, novelist, joseph, conrad, conrad, called, the, book, his, favorite, bedside, companion, and, used, information, from, it, for, several, of, his, novels, especially, lord, jim, a, set, of, 80, bird, skeletons, wallace, collected, in, indonesia, are, held, in, the, cambridge, university, museum, of, zoology, and, described, as, of, exceptional, historical, significance, in, 1862, wallace, returned, to, britain, where, he, moved, in, with, his, sister, fanny, sims, and, her, husband, thomas, while, recovering, from, his, travels, wallace, organised, his, collections, and, gave, numerous, lectures, about, his, adventures, and, discoveries, to, scientific, societies, such, as, the, zoological, society, of, london, later, that, year, he, visited, darwin, at, down, house, and, became, friendly, with, both, lyell, and, the, philosopher, herbert, spencer, during, the, 1860s, wallace, wrote, papers, and, gave, lectures, defending, natural, selection, he, corresponded, with, darwin, about, topics, including, sexual, selection, warning, coloration, and, the, possible, effect, of, natural, selection, on, hybridisation, and, the, divergence, of, species, in, 1865, he, began, investigating, spiritualism, after, a, year, of, courtship, wallace, became, engaged, in, 1864, to, a, young, woman, whom, in, his, autobiography, he, would, only, identify, as, miss, l, miss, l, was, the, daughter, of, lewis, leslie, who, played, chess, with, wallace, but, to, wallace, s, great, dismay, she, broke, off, the, engagement, in, 1866, wallace, married, annie, mitten, wallace, had, been, introduced, to, mitten, through, the, botanist, richard, spruce, who, had, befriended, wallace, in, brazil, and, who, was, a, friend, of, annie, mitten, s, father, william, mitten, an, expert, on, mosses, in, 1872, wallace, built, the, dell, a, house, of, concrete, on, land, he, leased, in, grays, in, essex, where, he, lived, until, 1876, the, wallaces, had, three, children, herbert, 1867, 1874, violet, 1869, 1945, and, william, 1871, 1951, in, the, late, 1860s, and, 1870s, wallace, was, very, concerned, about, the, financial, security, of, his, family, while, he, was, in, the, malay, archipelago, the, sale, of, specimens, had, brought, in, a, considerable, amount, of, money, which, had, been, carefully, invested, by, the, agent, who, sold, the, specimens, for, wallace, on, his, return, to, the, uk, wallace, made, a, series, of, bad, investments, in, railways, and, mines, that, squandered, most, of, the, money, and, he, found, himself, badly, in, need, of, the, proceeds, from, the, publication, of, the, malay, archipelago, despite, assistance, from, his, friends, he, was, never, able, to, secure, a, permanent, salaried, position, such, as, a, curatorship, in, a, museum, to, remain, financially, solvent, wallace, worked, grading, government, examinations, wrote, 25, papers, for, publication, between, 1872, and, 1876, for, various, modest, sums, and, was, paid, by, lyell, and, darwin, to, help, edit, some, of, their, works, in, 1876, wallace, needed, a, 500, advance, from, the, publisher, of, the, geographical, distribution, of, animals, to, avoid, having, to, sell, some, of, his, personal, property, darwin, was, very, aware, of, wallace, s, financial, difficulties, and, lobbied, long, and, hard, to, get, wallace, awarded, a, government, pension, for, his, lifetime, contributions, to, science, when, the, 200, annual, pension, was, awarded, in, 1881, it, helped, to, stabilise, wallace, s, financial, position, by, supplementing, the, income, from, his, writings, in, 1881, wallace, was, elected, as, the, first, president, of, the, newly, formed, land, nationalisation, society, in, the, next, year, he, published, a, book, land, nationalisation, its, necessity, and, its, aims, on, the, subject, he, criticised, the, uk, s, free, trade, policies, for, the, negative, impact, they, had, on, working, class, people, in, 1889, wallace, read, looking, backward, by, edward, bellamy, and, declared, himself, a, socialist, despite, his, earlier, foray, as, a, speculative, investor, after, reading, progress, and, poverty, the, bestselling, book, by, the, progressive, land, reformist, henry, george, wallace, described, it, as, undoubtedly, the, most, remarkable, and, important, book, of, the, present, century, wallace, opposed, eugenics, an, idea, supported, by, other, prominent, 19th, century, evolutionary, thinkers, on, the, grounds, that, contemporary, society, was, too, corrupt, and, unjust, to, allow, any, reasonable, determination, of, who, was, fit, or, unfit, in, his, 1890, article, human, selection, he, wrote, those, who, succeed, in, the, race, for, wealth, are, by, no, means, the, best, or, the, most, intelligent, he, said, the, world, does, not, want, the, eugenicist, to, set, it, straight, give, the, people, good, conditions, improve, their, environment, and, all, will, tend, towards, the, highest, type, eugenics, is, simply, the, meddlesome, interference, of, an, arrogant, scientific, priestcraft, in, 1898, wallace, wrote, a, paper, advocating, a, pure, paper, money, system, not, backed, by, silver, or, gold, which, impressed, the, economist, irving, fisher, so, much, that, he, dedicated, his, 1920, book, stabilizing, the, dollar, to, wallace, wallace, wrote, on, other, social, and, political, topics, including, in, support, of, women, s, suffrage, and, repeatedly, on, the, dangers, and, wastefulness, of, militarism, in, an, 1899, essay, he, called, for, popular, opinion, to, be, rallied, against, warfare, by, showing, people, that, all, modern, wars, are, dynastic, that, they, are, caused, by, the, ambition, the, interests, the, jealousies, and, the, insatiable, greed, of, power, of, their, rulers, or, of, the, great, mercantile, and, financial, classes, which, have, power, and, influence, over, their, rulers, and, that, the, results, of, war, are, never, good, for, the, people, who, yet, bear, all, its, burthens, burdens, in, a, letter, published, by, the, daily, mail, in, 1909, with, aviation, in, its, infancy, he, advocated, an, international, treaty, to, ban, the, military, use, of, aircraft, arguing, against, the, idea, that, this, new, horror, is, inevitable, and, that, all, we, can, do, is, to, be, sure, and, be, in, the, front, rank, of, the, aerial, assassins, for, surely, no, other, term, can, so, fitly, describe, the, dropping, of, say, ten, thousand, bombs, at, midnight, into, an, enemy, s, capital, from, an, invisible, flight, of, airships, in, 1898, wallace, published, the, wonderful, century, its, successes, and, its, failures, about, developments, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, part, of, the, book, covered, the, major, scientific, and, technical, advances, of, the, century, the, second, part, covered, what, wallace, considered, to, be, its, social, failures, including, the, destruction, and, waste, of, wars, and, arms, races, the, rise, of, the, urban, poor, and, the, dangerous, conditions, in, which, they, lived, and, worked, a, harsh, criminal, justice, system, that, failed, to, reform, criminals, abuses, in, a, mental, health, system, based, on, privately, owned, sanatoriums, the, environmental, damage, caused, by, capitalism, and, the, evils, of, european, colonialism, wallace, continued, his, social, activism, for, the, rest, of, his, life, publishing, the, book, the, revolt, of, democracy, just, weeks, before, his, death, in, 1880, he, published, island, life, as, a, sequel, to, the, geographic, distribution, of, animals, in, november, 1886, wallace, began, a, ten, month, trip, to, the, united, states, to, give, a, series, of, popular, lectures, most, of, the, lectures, were, on, darwinism, evolution, through, natural, selection, but, he, also, gave, speeches, on, biogeography, spiritualism, and, socio, economic, reform, during, the, trip, he, was, reunited, with, his, brother, john, who, had, emigrated, to, california, years, before, he, spent, a, week, in, colorado, with, the, american, botanist, alice, eastwood, as, his, guide, exploring, the, flora, of, the, rocky, mountains, and, gathering, evidence, that, would, lead, him, to, a, theory, on, how, glaciation, might, explain, certain, commonalities, between, the, mountain, flora, of, europe, asia, and, north, america, which, he, published, in, 1891, in, the, paper, english, and, american, flowers, he, met, many, other, prominent, american, naturalists, and, viewed, their, collections, his, 1889, book, darwinism, used, information, he, collected, on, his, american, trip, and, information, he, had, compiled, for, the, lectures, on, 7, november, 1913, wallace, died, at, home, aged, 90, in, the, country, house, he, called, old, orchard, which, he, had, built, a, decade, earlier, his, death, was, widely, reported, in, the, press, the, new, york, times, called, him, the, last, of, the, giants, to, that, wonderful, group, of, intellectuals, composed, of, darwin, huxley, spencer, lyell, owen, and, other, scientists, whose, daring, investigations, revolutionized, and, evolutionized, the, thought, of, the, century, another, commentator, in, the, same, edition, said, no, apology, need, be, made, for, the, few, literary, or, scientific, follies, of, the, author, of, that, great, book, on, the, malay, archipelago, vol, 1, vol, 2, some, of, wallace, s, friends, suggested, that, he, be, buried, in, westminster, abbey, but, his, wife, followed, his, wishes, and, had, him, buried, in, the, small, cemetery, at, broadstone, dorset, several, prominent, british, scientists, formed, a, committee, to, have, a, medallion, of, wallace, placed, in, westminster, abbey, near, where, darwin, had, been, buried, the, medallion, was, unveiled, on, 1, november, 1915, wallace, began, his, career, as, a, travelling, naturalist, who, already, believed, in, the, transmutation, of, species, the, concept, had, been, advocated, by, jean, baptiste, lamarck, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, erasmus, darwin, and, robert, grant, among, others, it, was, widely, discussed, but, not, generally, accepted, by, leading, naturalists, and, was, considered, to, have, radical, even, revolutionary, connotations, prominent, anatomists, and, geologists, such, as, georges, cuvier, richard, owen, adam, sedgwick, and, lyell, attacked, transmutation, vigorously, it, has, been, suggested, that, wallace, accepted, the, idea, of, the, transmutation, of, species, in, part, because, he, was, always, inclined, to, favour, radical, ideas, in, politics, religion, and, science, and, because, he, was, unusually, open, to, marginal, even, fringe, ideas, in, science, wallace, was, profoundly, influenced, by, robert, chambers, s, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, a, controversial, work, of, popular, science, published, anonymously, in, 1844, it, advocated, an, evolutionary, origin, for, the, solar, system, the, earth, and, living, things, wallace, wrote, to, henry, bates, in, 1845, describing, it, as, an, ingenious, hypothesis, strongly, supported, by, some, striking, facts, and, analogies, but, which, remains, to, be, proven, by, more, research, in, 1847, he, wrote, to, bates, that, he, would, like, to, take, some, one, family, to, study, thoroughly, with, a, view, to, the, theory, of, the, origin, of, species, wallace, planned, fieldwork, to, test, the, evolutionary, hypothesis, that, closely, related, species, should, inhabit, neighbouring, territories, during, his, work, in, the, amazon, basin, he, came, to, realise, that, geographical, barriers, such, as, the, amazon, and, its, major, tributaries, often, separated, the, ranges, of, closely, allied, species, he, included, these, observations, in, his, 1853, paper, on, the, monkeys, of, the, amazon, near, the, end, of, the, paper, he, asked, the, question, are, very, closely, allied, species, ever, separated, by, a, wide, interval, of, country, in, february, 1855, while, working, in, sarawak, on, the, island, of, borneo, wallace, wrote, on, the, law, which, has, regulated, the, introduction, of, new, species, the, paper, was, published, in, the, annals, and, magazine, of, natural, history, in, september, 1855, in, this, paper, he, discussed, observations, of, the, geographic, and, geologic, distribution, of, both, living, and, fossil, species, a, field, that, became, biogeography, his, conclusion, that, every, species, has, come, into, existence, coincident, both, in, space, and, time, with, a, closely, allied, species, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, sarawak, law, answering, his, own, question, in, his, paper, on, the, monkeys, of, the, amazon, basin, although, it, does, not, mention, possible, mechanisms, for, evolution, this, paper, foreshadowed, the, momentous, paper, he, would, write, three, years, later, the, paper, challenged, lyell, s, belief, that, species, were, immutable, although, darwin, had, written, to, him, in, 1842, expressing, support, for, transmutation, lyell, had, continued, to, be, strongly, opposed, to, the, idea, around, the, start, of, 1856, he, told, darwin, about, wallace, s, paper, as, did, edward, blyth, who, thought, it, good, upon, the, whole, wallace, has, i, think, put, the, matter, well, and, according, to, his, theory, the, various, domestic, races, of, animals, have, been, fairly, developed, into, species, despite, this, hint, darwin, mistook, wallace, s, conclusion, for, the, progressive, creationism, of, the, time, writing, that, it, was, nothing, very, new, uses, my, simile, of, tree, it, seems, all, creation, with, him, lyell, was, more, impressed, and, opened, a, notebook, on, species, in, which, he, grappled, with, the, consequences, particularly, for, human, ancestry, darwin, had, already, shown, his, theory, to, their, mutual, friend, joseph, hooker, and, now, for, the, first, time, spelt, out, the, full, details, of, natural, selection, to, lyell, although, lyell, could, not, agree, he, urged, darwin, to, publish, to, establish, priority, darwin, demurred, at, first, but, began, writing, up, a, species, sketch, of, his, continuing, work, in, may, 1856, by, february, 1858, wallace, had, been, convinced, by, his, biogeographical, research, in, the, malay, archipelago, that, evolution, was, real, he, later, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, the, problem, was, of, how, species, change, from, one, well, marked, form, to, another, he, stated, that, it, was, while, he, was, in, bed, with, a, fever, that, he, thought, about, malthus, s, idea, of, positive, checks, on, human, population, and, had, the, idea, of, natural, selection, his, autobiography, says, that, he, was, on, the, island, of, ternate, at, the, time, but, the, evidence, of, his, journal, suggests, that, he, was, in, fact, on, the, island, of, gilolo, from, 1858, to, 1861, he, rented, a, house, on, ternate, from, the, dutchman, maarten, dirk, van, renesse, van, duivenbode, which, he, used, as, a, base, for, expeditions, to, other, islands, such, as, gilolo, wallace, describes, how, he, discovered, natural, selection, as, follows, it, then, occurred, to, me, that, these, causes, or, their, equivalents, are, continually, acting, in, the, case, of, animals, also, and, as, animals, usually, breed, much, more, quickly, than, does, mankind, the, destruction, every, year, from, these, causes, must, be, enormous, to, keep, down, the, numbers, of, each, species, since, evidently, they, do, not, increase, regularly, from, year, to, year, as, otherwise, the, world, would, long, ago, have, been, crowded, with, those, that, breed, most, quickly, vaguely, thinking, over, the, enormous, and, constant, destruction, which, this, implied, it, occurred, to, me, to, ask, the, question, why, do, some, die, and, some, live, and, the, answer, was, clearly, on, the, whole, the, best, fitted, live, and, considering, the, amount, of, individual, variation, that, my, experience, as, a, collector, had, shown, me, to, exist, then, it, followed, that, all, the, changes, necessary, for, the, adaptation, of, the, species, to, the, changing, conditions, would, be, brought, about, in, this, way, every, part, of, an, animals, organization, could, be, modified, exactly, as, required, and, in, the, very, process, of, this, modification, the, unmodified, would, die, out, and, thus, the, definite, characters, and, the, clear, isolation, of, each, new, species, would, be, explained, wallace, had, once, briefly, met, darwin, and, was, one, of, the, correspondents, whose, observations, darwin, used, to, support, his, own, theories, although, wallace, s, first, letter, to, darwin, has, been, lost, wallace, carefully, kept, the, letters, he, received, in, the, first, letter, dated, 1, may, 1857, darwin, commented, that, wallace, s, letter, of, 10, october, which, he, had, recently, received, as, well, as, wallace, s, paper, on, the, law, which, has, regulated, the, introduction, of, new, species, of, 1855, showed, that, they, thought, alike, with, similar, conclusions, and, said, that, he, was, preparing, his, own, work, for, publication, in, about, two, years, time, the, second, letter, dated, 22, december, 1857, said, how, glad, he, was, that, wallace, was, theorising, about, distribution, adding, that, without, speculation, there, is, no, good, and, original, observation, but, commented, that, i, believe, i, go, much, further, than, you, wallace, believed, this, and, sent, darwin, his, february, 1858, essay, on, the, tendency, of, varieties, to, depart, indefinitely, from, the, original, type, asking, darwin, to, review, it, and, pass, it, to, charles, lyell, if, he, thought, it, worthwhile, although, wallace, had, sent, several, articles, for, journal, publication, during, his, travels, through, the, malay, archipelago, the, ternate, essay, was, in, a, private, letter, darwin, received, the, essay, on, 18, june, 1858, although, the, essay, did, not, use, darwin, s, term, natural, selection, it, did, outline, the, mechanics, of, an, evolutionary, divergence, of, species, from, similar, ones, due, to, environmental, pressures, in, this, sense, it, was, very, similar, to, the, theory, that, darwin, had, worked, on, for, 20, years, but, had, yet, to, publish, darwin, sent, the, manuscript, to, charles, lyell, with, a, letter, saying, he, could, not, have, made, a, better, short, abstract, even, his, terms, now, stand, as, heads, of, my, chapters, he, does, not, say, he, wishes, me, to, publish, but, i, shall, of, course, at, once, write, and, offer, to, send, to, any, journal, distraught, about, the, illness, of, his, baby, son, darwin, put, the, problem, to, charles, lyell, and, joseph, hooker, who, decided, to, publish, the, essay, in, a, joint, presentation, together, with, unpublished, writings, which, highlighted, darwin, s, priority, wallace, s, essay, was, presented, to, the, linnean, society, of, london, on, 1, july, 1858, along, with, excerpts, from, an, essay, which, darwin, had, disclosed, privately, to, hooker, in, 1847, and, a, letter, darwin, had, written, to, asa, gray, in, 1857, communication, with, wallace, in, the, far, off, malay, archipelago, involved, months, of, delay, so, he, was, not, part, of, this, rapid, publication, wallace, accepted, the, arrangement, after, the, fact, happy, that, he, had, been, included, at, all, and, never, expressed, bitterness, in, public, or, in, private, darwin, s, social, and, scientific, status, was, far, greater, than, wallace, s, and, it, was, unlikely, that, without, darwin, wallace, s, views, on, evolution, would, have, been, taken, seriously, lyell, and, hooker, s, arrangement, relegated, wallace, to, the, position, of, co, discoverer, and, he, was, not, the, social, equal, of, darwin, or, the, other, prominent, british, natural, scientists, all, the, same, the, joint, reading, of, their, papers, on, natural, selection, associated, wallace, with, the, more, famous, darwin, this, combined, with, darwin, s, as, well, as, hooker, s, and, lyell, s, advocacy, on, his, behalf, would, give, wallace, greater, access, to, the, highest, levels, of, the, scientific, community, the, reaction, to, the, reading, was, muted, with, the, president, of, the, linnean, society, remarking, in, may, 1859, that, the, year, had, not, been, marked, by, any, striking, discoveries, but, with, darwin, s, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, later, in, 1859, its, significance, became, apparent, when, wallace, returned, to, the, uk, he, met, darwin, although, some, of, wallace, s, opinions, in, the, ensuing, years, would, test, darwin, s, patience, they, remained, on, friendly, terms, for, the, rest, of, darwin, s, life, over, the, years, a, few, people, have, questioned, this, version, of, events, in, the, early, 1980s, two, books, one, by, arnold, brackman, and, another, by, john, langdon, brooks, suggested, not, only, that, there, had, been, a, conspiracy, to, rob, wallace, of, his, proper, credit, but, that, darwin, had, actually, stolen, a, key, idea, from, wallace, to, finish, his, own, theory, these, claims, have, been, examined, and, found, unconvincing, by, a, number, of, scholars, shipping, schedules, show, that, contrary, to, these, accusations, wallace, s, letter, could, not, have, been, delivered, earlier, than, the, date, shown, in, darwin, s, letter, to, lyell, after, wallace, returned, to, england, in, 1862, he, became, one, of, the, staunchest, defenders, of, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, in, an, incident, in, 1863, that, particularly, pleased, darwin, wallace, published, the, short, paper, remarks, on, the, rev, s, haughton, s, paper, on, the, bee, s, cell, and, on, the, origin, of, species, this, rebutted, a, paper, by, a, professor, of, geology, at, the, university, of, dublin, that, had, sharply, criticised, darwin, s, comments, in, the, origin, on, how, hexagonal, honey, bee, cells, could, have, evolved, through, natural, selection, an, even, longer, defence, was, a, 1867, article, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, science, called, creation, by, law, it, reviewed, george, campbell, the, 8th, duke, of, argyll, s, book, the, reign, of, law, which, aimed, to, refute, natural, selection, after, an, 1870, meeting, of, the, british, science, association, wallace, wrote, to, darwin, complaining, that, there, were, no, opponents, left, who, know, anything, of, natural, history, so, that, there, are, none, of, the, good, discussions, we, used, to, have, historians, of, science, have, noted, that, while, darwin, considered, the, ideas, in, wallace, s, paper, to, be, essentially, the, same, as, his, own, there, were, differences, darwin, emphasised, competition, between, individuals, of, the, same, species, to, survive, and, reproduce, whereas, wallace, emphasised, environmental, pressures, on, varieties, and, species, forcing, them, to, become, adapted, to, their, local, conditions, leading, populations, in, different, locations, to, diverge, the, historian, of, science, peter, j, bowler, has, suggested, that, in, the, paper, he, mailed, to, darwin, wallace, might, have, been, discussing, group, selection, against, this, malcolm, kottler, showed, that, wallace, was, indeed, discussing, individual, variation, and, selection, others, have, noted, that, wallace, appeared, to, have, envisioned, natural, selection, as, a, kind, of, feedback, mechanism, that, kept, species, and, varieties, adapted, to, their, environment, now, called, stabilizing, as, opposed, to, directional, selection, they, point, to, a, largely, overlooked, passage, of, wallace, s, famous, 1858, paper, in, which, he, likened, this, principle, the, centrifugal, governor, of, the, steam, engine, which, checks, and, corrects, any, irregularities, the, cybernetician, and, anthropologist, gregory, bateson, observed, in, the, 1970s, that, although, writing, it, only, as, an, example, wallace, had, probably, said, the, most, powerful, thing, that, d, been, said, in, the, 19th, century, bateson, revisited, the, topic, in, his, 1979, book, mind, and, nature, a, necessary, unity, and, other, scholars, have, continued, to, explore, the, connection, between, natural, selection, and, systems, theory, warning, coloration, was, one, of, wallace, s, contributions, to, the, evolutionary, biology, of, animal, coloration, in, 1867, darwin, wrote, to, wallace, about, a, problem, in, explaining, how, some, caterpillars, could, have, evolved, conspicuous, colour, schemes, darwin, had, come, to, believe, that, many, conspicuous, animal, colour, schemes, were, due, to, sexual, selection, but, he, saw, that, this, could, not, apply, to, caterpillars, wallace, responded, that, he, and, bates, had, observed, that, many, of, the, most, spectacular, butterflies, had, a, peculiar, odour, and, taste, and, that, he, had, been, told, by, john, jenner, weir, that, birds, would, not, eat, a, certain, kind, of, common, white, moth, because, they, found, it, unpalatable, since, the, moth, was, as, conspicuous, at, dusk, as, a, coloured, caterpillar, in, daylight, it, seemed, likely, that, the, conspicuous, colours, served, as, a, warning, to, predators, and, thus, could, have, evolved, through, natural, selection, darwin, was, impressed, by, the, idea, at, a, later, meeting, of, the, entomological, society, wallace, asked, for, any, evidence, anyone, might, have, on, the, topic, in, 1869, weir, published, data, from, experiments, and, observations, involving, brightly, coloured, caterpillars, that, supported, wallace, s, idea, wallace, attributed, less, importance, than, darwin, to, sexual, selection, in, his, 1878, book, tropical, nature, and, other, essays, he, wrote, extensively, about, the, coloration, of, animals, and, plants, and, proposed, alternative, explanations, for, a, number, of, cases, darwin, had, attributed, to, sexual, selection, he, revisited, the, topic, at, length, in, his, 1889, book, darwinism, in, 1890, he, wrote, a, critical, review, in, nature, of, his, friend, edward, bagnall, poulton, s, the, colours, of, animals, which, supported, darwin, on, sexual, selection, attacking, especially, poulton, s, claims, on, the, aesthetic, preferences, of, the, insect, world, in, 1889, wallace, wrote, the, book, darwinism, which, explained, and, defended, natural, selection, in, it, he, proposed, the, hypothesis, that, natural, selection, could, drive, the, reproductive, isolation, of, two, varieties, by, encouraging, the, development, of, barriers, against, hybridisation, thus, it, might, contribute, to, the, development, of, new, species, he, suggested, the, following, scenario, when, two, populations, of, a, species, had, diverged, beyond, a, certain, point, each, adapted, to, particular, conditions, hybrid, offspring, would, be, less, adapted, than, either, parent, form, and, so, natural, selection, would, tend, to, eliminate, the, hybrids, furthermore, under, such, conditions, natural, selection, would, favour, the, development, of, barriers, to, hybridisation, as, individuals, that, avoided, hybrid, matings, would, tend, to, have, more, fit, offspring, and, thus, contribute, to, the, reproductive, isolation, of, the, two, incipient, species, this, idea, came, to, be, known, as, the, wallace, effect, later, called, reinforcement, wallace, had, suggested, to, darwin, that, natural, selection, could, play, a, role, in, preventing, hybridisation, in, private, correspondence, as, early, as, 1868, but, had, not, worked, it, out, to, this, level, of, detail, it, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, research, in, evolutionary, biology, today, with, both, computer, simulation, and, empirical, results, supporting, its, validity, in, 1864, wallace, published, a, paper, the, origin, of, human, races, and, the, antiquity, of, man, deduced, from, the, theory, of, natural, selection, applying, the, theory, to, humankind, darwin, had, not, yet, publicly, addressed, the, subject, although, thomas, huxley, had, in, evidence, as, to, man, s, place, in, nature, wallace, explained, the, apparent, stability, of, the, human, stock, by, pointing, to, the, vast, gap, in, cranial, capacities, between, humans, and, the, great, apes, unlike, some, other, darwinists, including, darwin, himself, he, did, not, regard, modern, primitives, as, almost, filling, the, gap, between, man, and, ape, he, saw, the, evolution, of, humans, in, two, stages, achieving, a, bipedal, posture, that, freed, the, hands, to, carry, out, the, dictates, of, the, brain, and, the, recognition, of, the, human, brain, as, a, totally, new, factor, in, the, history, of, life, wallace, seems, to, have, been, the, first, evolutionist, to, see, that, the, human, brain, effectively, made, further, specialisation, of, the, body, unnecessary, wallace, wrote, the, paper, for, the, anthropological, society, of, london, to, address, the, debate, between, the, supporters, of, monogenism, the, belief, that, all, human, races, shared, a, common, ancestor, and, were, one, species, and, the, supporters, of, polygenism, who, held, that, different, races, had, separate, origins, and, were, different, species, wallace, s, anthropological, observations, of, native, americans, in, the, amazon, and, especially, his, time, living, among, the, dayak, people, of, borneo, had, convinced, him, that, human, beings, were, a, single, species, with, a, common, ancestor, he, still, felt, that, natural, selection, might, have, continued, to, act, on, mental, faculties, after, the, development, of, the, different, races, and, he, did, not, dispute, the, nearly, universal, view, among, european, anthropologists, of, the, time, that, europeans, were, intellectually, superior, to, other, races, according, to, political, scientist, adam, jones, wallace, found, little, difficulty, in, reconciling, the, extermination, of, native, peoples, with, his, progressive, political, views, in, 1864, in, the, aforementioned, paper, he, stated, it, is, the, same, great, law, of, the, preservation, of, favored, races, in, the, struggle, for, life, which, leads, to, the, inevitable, extinction, of, all, those, low, and, mentally, undeveloped, populations, with, which, europeans, come, in, contact, he, argued, that, the, natives, die, out, due, to, an, unequal, struggle, shortly, afterwards, wallace, became, a, spiritualist, at, about, the, same, time, he, began, to, maintain, that, natural, selection, could, not, account, for, mathematical, artistic, or, musical, genius, metaphysical, musings, or, wit, and, humour, he, stated, that, something, in, the, unseen, universe, of, spirit, had, interceded, at, least, three, times, in, history, the, creation, of, life, from, inorganic, matter, the, introduction, of, consciousness, in, the, higher, animals, and, the, generation, of, the, higher, mental, faculties, in, humankind, he, believed, that, the, raison, d, tre, of, the, universe, was, the, development, of, the, human, spirit, while, some, historians, have, concluded, that, wallace, s, belief, that, natural, selection, was, insufficient, to, explain, the, development, of, consciousness, and, the, higher, functions, of, the, human, mind, was, directly, caused, by, his, adoption, of, spiritualism, other, scholars, have, disagreed, and, some, maintain, that, wallace, never, believed, natural, selection, applied, to, those, areas, reaction, to, wallace, s, ideas, on, this, topic, among, leading, naturalists, at, the, time, varied, lyell, endorsed, wallace, s, views, on, human, evolution, rather, than, darwin, s, wallace, s, belief, that, human, consciousness, could, not, be, entirely, a, product, of, purely, material, causes, was, shared, by, a, number, of, prominent, intellectuals, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, all, the, same, many, including, huxley, hooker, and, darwin, himself, were, critical, of, wallace, s, views, as, the, historian, of, science, and, sceptic, michael, shermer, has, stated, wallace, s, views, in, this, area, were, at, odds, with, two, major, tenets, of, the, emerging, darwinian, philosophy, these, were, that, evolution, was, not, teleological, purpose, driven, and, that, it, was, not, anthropocentric, human, centred, much, later, in, his, life, wallace, returned, to, these, themes, that, evolution, suggested, that, the, universe, might, have, a, purpose, and, that, certain, aspects, of, living, organisms, might, not, be, explainable, in, terms, of, purely, materialistic, processes, he, set, out, his, ideas, in, a, 1909, magazine, article, entitled, the, world, of, life, later, expanded, into, a, book, of, the, same, name, shermer, commented, that, this, anticipated, ideas, about, design, in, nature, and, directed, evolution, that, would, arise, from, religious, traditions, throughout, the, 20th, century, in, many, accounts, of, the, development, of, evolutionary, theory, wallace, is, mentioned, only, in, passing, as, simply, being, the, stimulus, to, the, publication, of, darwin, s, own, theory, in, reality, wallace, developed, his, own, distinct, evolutionary, views, which, diverged, from, darwin, s, and, was, considered, by, many, especially, darwin, to, be, a, leading, thinker, on, evolution, in, his, day, whose, ideas, could, not, be, ignored, one, historian, of, science, has, pointed, out, that, through, both, private, correspondence, and, published, works, darwin, and, wallace, exchanged, knowledge, and, stimulated, each, other, s, ideas, and, theories, over, an, extended, period, wallace, is, the, most, cited, naturalist, in, darwin, s, descent, of, man, occasionally, in, strong, disagreement, darwin, and, wallace, agreed, on, the, importance, of, natural, selection, and, some, of, the, factors, responsible, for, it, competition, between, species, and, geographical, isolation, but, wallace, believed, that, evolution, had, a, purpose, teleology, in, maintaining, species, fitness, to, their, environment, whereas, darwin, hesitated, to, attribute, any, purpose, to, a, random, natural, process, scientific, discoveries, since, the, 19th, century, support, darwin, s, viewpoint, by, identifying, additional, mechanisms, and, triggers, such, as, mutations, triggered, by, environmental, radiation, or, mutagenic, chemicals, wallace, remained, an, ardent, defender, of, natural, selection, for, the, rest, of, his, life, by, the, 1880s, evolution, was, widely, accepted, in, scientific, circles, but, natural, selection, less, so, wallace, s, 1889, darwinism, was, a, response, to, the, scientific, critics, of, natural, selection, of, all, wallace, s, books, it, is, the, most, cited, by, scholarly, publications, in, 1872, at, the, urging, of, many, of, his, friends, including, darwin, philip, sclater, and, alfred, newton, wallace, began, research, for, a, general, review, of, the, geographic, distribution, of, animals, initial, progress, was, slow, in, part, because, classification, systems, for, many, types, of, animals, were, in, flux, he, resumed, the, work, in, earnest, in, 1874, after, the, publication, of, a, number, of, new, works, on, classification, extending, the, system, developed, by, sclater, for, birds, which, divided, the, earth, into, six, separate, geographic, regions, for, describing, species, distribution, to, cover, mammals, reptiles, and, insects, as, well, wallace, created, the, basis, for, the, zoogeographic, regions, in, use, today, he, discussed, the, factors, then, known, to, influence, the, current, and, past, geographic, distribution, of, animals, within, each, geographic, region, these, factors, included, the, effects, of, the, appearance, and, disappearance, of, land, bridges, such, as, the, one, currently, connecting, north, america, and, south, america, and, the, effects, of, periods, of, increased, glaciation, he, provided, maps, showing, factors, such, as, elevation, of, mountains, depths, of, oceans, and, the, character, of, regional, vegetation, that, affected, the, distribution, of, animals, he, summarised, all, the, known, families, and, genera, of, the, higher, animals, and, listed, their, known, geographic, distributions, the, text, was, organised, so, that, it, would, be, easy, for, a, traveller, to, learn, what, animals, could, be, found, in, a, particular, location, the, resulting, two, volume, work, the, geographical, distribution, of, animals, was, published, in, 1876, and, served, as, the, definitive, text, on, zoogeography, for, the, next, 80, years, the, book, included, evidence, from, the, fossil, record, to, discuss, the, processes, of, evolution, and, migration, that, had, led, to, the, geographical, distribution, of, modern, species, for, example, he, discussed, how, fossil, evidence, showed, that, tapirs, had, originated, in, the, northern, hemisphere, migrating, between, north, america, and, eurasia, and, then, much, more, recently, to, south, america, after, which, the, northern, species, became, extinct, leaving, the, modern, distribution, of, two, isolated, groups, of, tapir, species, in, south, america, and, southeast, asia, wallace, was, very, aware, of, and, interested, in, the, mass, extinction, of, megafauna, in, the, late, pleistocene, in, the, geographical, distribution, of, animals, 1876, he, wrote, we, live, in, a, zoologically, impoverished, world, from, which, all, the, hugest, and, fiercest, and, strangest, forms, have, recently, disappeared, he, added, that, he, believed, the, most, likely, cause, for, the, rapid, extinctions, was, glaciation, but, by, the, time, he, wrote, world, of, life, 1911, he, had, come, to, believe, those, extinctions, were, due, to, man, s, agency, in, 1880, wallace, published, the, book, island, life, as, a, sequel, to, the, geographical, distribution, of, animals, it, surveyed, the, distribution, of, both, animal, and, plant, species, on, islands, wallace, classified, islands, into, oceanic, and, two, types, of, continental, islands, oceanic, islands, in, his, view, such, as, the, galapagos, and, hawaiian, islands, then, called, sandwich, islands, formed, in, mid, ocean, and, never, part, of, any, large, continent, such, islands, were, characterised, by, a, complete, lack, of, terrestrial, mammals, and, amphibians, and, their, inhabitants, except, migratory, birds, and, species, introduced, by, humans, were, typically, the, result, of, accidental, colonisation, and, subsequent, evolution, continental, islands, in, his, scheme, were, divided, into, those, that, were, recently, separated, from, a, continent, like, britain, and, those, much, less, recently, like, madagascar, wallace, discussed, how, that, difference, affected, flora, and, fauna, he, discussed, how, isolation, affected, evolution, and, how, that, could, result, in, the, preservation, of, classes, of, animals, such, as, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, that, were, remnants, of, once, widespread, continental, faunas, he, extensively, discussed, how, changes, of, climate, particularly, periods, of, increased, glaciation, may, have, affected, the, distribution, of, flora, and, fauna, on, some, islands, and, the, first, portion, of, the, book, discusses, possible, causes, of, these, great, ice, ages, island, life, was, considered, a, very, important, work, at, the, time, of, its, publication, it, was, discussed, extensively, in, scientific, circles, both, in, published, reviews, and, in, private, correspondence, wallace, s, extensive, work, in, biogeography, made, him, aware, of, the, impact, of, human, activities, on, the, natural, world, in, tropical, nature, and, other, essays, 1878, he, warned, about, the, dangers, of, deforestation, and, soil, erosion, especially, in, tropical, climates, prone, to, heavy, rainfall, noting, the, complex, interactions, between, vegetation, and, climate, he, warned, that, the, extensive, clearing, of, rainforest, for, coffee, cultivation, in, ceylon, now, called, sri, lanka, and, india, would, adversely, impact, the, climate, in, those, countries, and, lead, to, their, impoverishment, due, to, soil, erosion, in, island, life, wallace, again, mentioned, deforestation, and, invasive, species, on, the, impact, of, european, colonisation, on, the, island, of, saint, helena, he, wrote, that, the, island, was, now, so, barren, and, forbidding, that, some, persons, find, it, difficult, to, believe, that, it, was, once, all, green, and, fertile, he, explained, that, the, soil, was, protected, by, the, island, s, vegetation, once, that, was, destroyed, the, soil, was, washed, off, the, steep, slopes, by, heavy, tropical, rain, leaving, bare, rock, or, sterile, clay, he, attributed, the, irreparable, destruction, to, feral, goats, introduced, in, 1513, the, island, s, forests, were, further, damaged, by, the, reckless, waste, of, the, east, india, company, from, 1651, which, used, the, bark, of, valuable, redwood, and, ebony, trees, for, tanning, leaving, the, wood, to, rot, unused, wallace, s, comments, on, environment, grew, more, urgent, later, in, his, career, in, the, world, of, life, 1911, he, wrote, that, people, should, view, nature, as, invested, with, a, certain, sanctity, to, be, used, by, us, but, not, abused, and, never, to, be, recklessly, destroyed, or, defaced, wallace, s, 1904, book, man, s, place, in, the, universe, was, the, first, serious, attempt, by, a, biologist, to, evaluate, the, likelihood, of, life, on, other, planets, he, concluded, that, the, earth, was, the, only, planet, in, the, solar, system, that, could, possibly, support, life, mainly, because, it, was, the, only, one, in, which, water, could, exist, in, the, liquid, phase, his, treatment, of, mars, in, this, book, was, brief, and, in, 1907, wallace, returned, to, the, subject, with, the, book, is, mars, habitable, to, criticise, the, claims, made, by, the, american, astronomer, percival, lowell, that, there, were, martian, canals, built, by, intelligent, beings, wallace, did, months, of, research, consulted, various, experts, and, produced, his, own, scientific, analysis, of, the, martian, climate, and, atmospheric, conditions, he, pointed, out, that, spectroscopic, analysis, had, shown, no, signs, of, water, vapour, in, the, martian, atmosphere, that, lowell, s, analysis, of, mars, s, climate, badly, overestimated, the, surface, temperature, and, that, low, atmospheric, pressure, would, make, liquid, water, let, alone, a, planet, girding, irrigation, system, impossible, richard, milner, comments, that, wallace, effectively, debunked, lowell, s, illusionary, network, of, martian, canals, wallace, became, interested, in, the, topic, because, his, anthropocentric, philosophy, inclined, him, to, believe, that, man, would, be, unique, in, the, universe, wallace, was, an, enthusiast, of, phrenology, early, in, his, career, he, experimented, with, hypnosis, then, known, as, mesmerism, managing, to, hypnotise, some, of, his, students, in, leicester, when, he, began, these, experiments, the, topic, was, very, controversial, early, experimenters, such, as, john, elliotson, had, been, harshly, criticised, by, the, medical, and, scientific, establishment, wallace, drew, a, connection, between, his, experiences, with, mesmerism, and, spiritualism, arguing, that, one, should, not, deny, observations, on, a, priori, grounds, of, absurdity, or, impossibility, wallace, began, investigating, spiritualism, in, the, summer, of, 1865, possibly, at, the, urging, of, his, older, sister, fanny, sims, after, reviewing, the, literature, and, attempting, to, test, what, he, witnessed, at, s, ances, he, came, to, believe, in, it, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, remained, convinced, that, at, least, some, s, ance, phenomena, were, genuine, despite, accusations, of, fraud, and, evidence, of, trickery, one, biographer, suggested, that, the, emotional, shock, when, his, first, fianc, e, broke, their, engagement, contributed, to, his, receptiveness, to, spiritualism, other, scholars, have, emphasised, his, desire, to, find, scientific, explanations, for, all, phenomena, in, 1874, wallace, visited, the, spirit, photographer, frederick, hudson, he, declared, that, a, photograph, of, him, with, his, deceased, mother, was, genuine, others, reached, a, different, conclusion, hudson, s, photographs, had, previously, been, exposed, as, fraudulent, in, 1872, wallace, s, public, advocacy, of, spiritualism, and, his, repeated, defence, of, spiritualist, mediums, against, allegations, of, fraud, in, the, 1870s, damaged, his, scientific, reputation, in, 1875, he, published, the, evidence, he, believed, proved, his, position, in, on, miracles, and, modern, spiritualism, his, attitude, permanently, strained, his, relationships, with, previously, friendly, scientists, such, as, henry, bates, thomas, huxley, and, even, darwin, others, such, as, the, physiologist, william, benjamin, carpenter, and, zoologist, e, ray, lankester, became, publicly, hostile, to, wallace, over, the, issue, wallace, was, heavily, criticised, by, the, press, the, lancet, was, particularly, harsh, when, in, 1879, darwin, first, tried, to, rally, support, among, naturalists, to, get, a, civil, pension, awarded, to, wallace, joseph, hooker, responded, that, wallace, has, lost, caste, considerably, not, only, by, his, adhesion, to, spiritualism, but, by, the, fact, of, his, having, deliberately, and, against, the, whole, voice, of, the, committee, of, his, section, of, the, british, association, brought, about, a, discussion, on, spiritualism, at, one, of, its, sectional, meetings, this, he, is, said, to, have, done, in, an, underhanded, manner, and, i, well, remember, the, indignation, it, gave, rise, to, in, the, b, a, council, hooker, eventually, relented, and, agreed, to, support, the, pension, request, in, 1870, a, flat, earth, proponent, named, john, hampden, offered, a, 500, wager, roughly, equivalent, to, 60, 000, in, 2023, in, a, magazine, advertisement, to, anyone, who, could, demonstrate, a, convex, curvature, in, a, body, of, water, such, as, a, river, canal, or, lake, wallace, intrigued, by, the, challenge, and, short, of, money, at, the, time, designed, an, experiment, in, which, he, set, up, two, objects, along, a, six, mile, 10, km, stretch, of, canal, both, objects, were, at, the, same, height, above, the, water, and, he, mounted, a, telescope, on, a, bridge, at, the, same, height, above, the, water, as, well, when, seen, through, the, telescope, one, object, appeared, higher, than, the, other, showing, the, curvature, of, the, earth, the, judge, for, the, wager, the, editor, of, field, magazine, declared, wallace, the, winner, but, hampden, refused, to, accept, the, result, he, sued, wallace, and, launched, a, campaign, which, persisted, for, several, years, of, writing, letters, to, various, publications, and, to, organisations, of, which, wallace, was, a, member, denouncing, him, as, a, swindler, and, a, thief, wallace, won, multiple, libel, suits, against, hampden, but, the, resulting, litigation, cost, wallace, more, than, the, amount, of, the, wager, and, the, controversy, frustrated, him, for, years, in, the, early, 1880s, wallace, joined, the, debate, over, mandatory, smallpox, vaccination, wallace, originally, saw, the, issue, as, a, matter, of, personal, liberty, but, after, studying, statistics, provided, by, anti, vaccination, activists, he, began, to, question, the, efficacy, of, vaccination, at, the, time, the, germ, theory, of, disease, was, new, and, far, from, universally, accepted, moreover, no, one, knew, enough, about, the, human, immune, system, to, understand, why, vaccination, worked, wallace, discovered, instances, where, supporters, of, vaccination, had, used, questionable, in, a, few, cases, completely, false, statistics, to, support, their, arguments, always, suspicious, of, authority, wallace, suspected, that, physicians, had, a, vested, interest, in, promoting, vaccination, and, became, convinced, that, reductions, in, the, incidence, of, smallpox, that, had, been, attributed, to, vaccination, were, due, to, better, hygiene, and, improvements, in, public, sanitation, another, factor, in, wallace, s, thinking, was, his, belief, that, because, of, the, action, of, natural, selection, organisms, were, in, a, state, of, balance, with, their, environment, and, that, everything, in, nature, served, a, useful, purpose, wallace, pointed, out, that, vaccination, which, at, the, time, was, often, unsanitary, could, be, dangerous, in, 1890, wallace, gave, evidence, to, a, royal, commission, investigating, the, controversy, it, found, errors, in, his, testimony, including, some, questionable, statistics, the, lancet, averred, that, wallace, and, other, activists, were, being, selective, in, their, choice, of, statistics, the, commission, found, that, smallpox, vaccination, was, effective, and, should, remain, compulsory, though, they, recommended, some, changes, in, procedures, to, improve, safety, and, that, the, penalties, for, people, who, refused, to, comply, be, made, less, severe, years, later, in, 1898, wallace, wrote, a, pamphlet, vaccination, a, delusion, its, penal, enforcement, a, crime, attacking, the, commission, s, findings, it, in, turn, was, attacked, by, the, lancet, which, stated, that, it, repeated, many, of, the, same, errors, as, his, evidence, given, to, the, commission, as, a, result, of, his, writing, wallace, became, a, well, known, figure, both, as, a, scientist, and, as, a, social, activist, and, was, often, sought, out, for, his, views, he, became, president, of, the, anthropology, section, of, the, british, association, in, 1866, and, of, the, entomological, society, of, london, in, 1870, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1873, the, british, association, elected, him, as, head, of, its, biology, section, in, 1876, he, was, elected, to, the, royal, society, in, 1893, he, was, asked, to, chair, the, international, congress, of, spiritualists, meeting, in, london, in, 1898, he, received, honorary, doctorates, and, professional, honours, such, the, royal, society, s, royal, medal, in, 1868, and, its, darwin, medal, in, 1890, and, the, order, of, merit, in, 1908, wallace, s, fame, faded, quickly, after, his, death, for, a, long, time, he, was, treated, as, a, relatively, obscure, figure, in, the, history, of, science, reasons, for, this, lack, of, attention, may, have, included, his, modesty, his, willingness, to, champion, unpopular, causes, without, regard, for, his, own, reputation, and, the, discomfort, of, much, of, the, scientific, community, with, some, of, his, unconventional, ideas, the, reason, that, the, theory, of, evolution, is, popularly, credited, to, darwin, is, likely, the, impact, of, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, recently, wallace, has, become, better, known, with, the, publication, of, at, least, five, book, length, biographies, and, two, anthologies, of, his, writings, published, since, 2000, a, web, page, dedicated, to, wallace, scholarship, is, maintained, at, western, kentucky, university, in, a, 2010, book, the, environmentalist, tim, flannery, argued, that, wallace, was, the, first, modern, scientist, to, comprehend, how, essential, cooperation, is, to, our, survival, and, suggested, that, wallace, s, understanding, of, natural, selection, and, his, later, work, on, the, atmosphere, should, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, to, modern, ecological, thinking, a, collection, of, his, medals, including, the, order, of, merit, were, sold, at, auction, for, 273, 000, in, 2022, the, natural, history, museum, london, co, ordinated,

freshwater, stingray, potamotrygon, wallacei, more, recently, several, new, species, have, been, named, during, the, bicentenary, year, of, wallace, s, birth, including, a, large, spider, from, peru, linothele, wallacei, sherwood, et, al, 2023, and, a, south, african, weevil, nama, wallacei, meregalli, borovec, 2023, wallace, was, a, prolific, author, in, 2002, historian, of, science, michael, shermer, published, a, quantitative, analysis, of, wallace, s, publications, he, found, that, wallace, had, published, 22, full, length, books, and, at, least, 747, shorter, pieces, 508, of, which, were, scientific, papers, 191, of, them, published, in, nature, he, further, broke, down, the, 747, short, pieces, by, their, primary, subjects, 29, were, on, biogeography, and, natural, history, 27,
