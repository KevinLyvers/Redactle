saint, peter, died, ad, 64, 68, also, known, as, peter, the, apostle, simon, peter, simeon, simon, or, cephas, was, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, of, jesus, christ, and, one, of, the, first, leaders, of, the, early, christian, church, he, appears, repeatedly, and, prominently, in, all, four, new, testament, gospels, as, well, as, the, acts, of, the, apostles, catholic, tradition, accredits, peter, as, the, first, bishop, of, rome, or, pope, and, also, as, the, first, bishop, of, antioch, according, to, christian, tradition, peter, was, crucified, in, rome, under, emperor, nero, the, ancient, christian, churches, all, venerate, peter, as, a, major, saint, and, as, the, founder, of, the, church, of, antioch, and, the, church, of, rome, but, they, differ, in, their, attitudes, regarding, the, authority, of, his, successors, according, to, catholic, teaching, jesus, promised, peter, a, special, position, in, the, church, in, the, new, testament, the, name, simon, peter, is, found, 19, times, he, is, the, brother, of, saint, andrew, and, they, both, were, fishermen, the, gospel, of, mark, in, particular, was, traditionally, thought, to, show, the, influence, of, peter, s, preaching, and, eyewitness, memories, he, is, also, mentioned, under, either, the, name, peter, or, cephas, in, paul, s, first, letter, to, the, corinthians, and, the, epistle, to, the, galatians, the, new, testament, also, includes, two, general, epistles, first, peter, and, second, peter, that, are, traditionally, attributed, to, him, but, modern, scholarship, generally, rejects, the, petrine, authorship, of, both, nevertheless, evangelicals, and, catholics, have, always, affirmed, peter, s, authorship, and, recently, evangelical, scholars, have, revived, the, claim, of, petrine, authorship, of, these, epistles, based, on, contemporary, historical, data, peter, s, papacy, is, estimated, to, have, spanned, from, ad, 30, to, his, death, which, would, make, him, the, longest, reigning, pope, at, anywhere, from, 34, to, 38, years, however, this, has, never, been, verified, saint, irenaeus, c, 130, c, 202, ad, explains, the, apostle, peter, his, see, and, his, successors, in, book, iii, of, adversus, haereses, against, heresies, in, the, book, irenaeus, wrote, that, peter, and, paul, founded, and, organised, the, church, in, rome, sources, suggest, that, at, first, the, terms, episcopos, and, presbyteros, were, used, interchangeably, with, the, consensus, among, scholars, being, that, by, the, turn, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, local, congregations, were, led, by, bishops, and, presbyters, whose, duties, of, office, overlapped, or, were, indistinguishable, from, one, another, protestant, and, secular, historians, generally, agree, that, there, was, probably, no, single, monarchical, bishop, in, rome, before, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, and, likely, later, outside, of, the, new, testament, several, apocryphal, books, were, later, attributed, to, him, in, particular, the, acts, of, peter, gospel, of, peter, preaching, of, peter, apocalypse, of, peter, and, judgment, of, peter, although, scholars, believe, these, works, to, be, pseudepigrapha, the, new, testament, presents, peter, s, original, name, as, simon, s, a, m, n, sim, n, in, greek, in, only, two, passages, his, name, is, instead, spelled, simeon, in, greek, the, variation, possibly, reflects, the, well, known, custom, among, jews, at, the, time, of, giving, the, name, of, a, famous, patriarch, or, personage, of, the, old, testament, to, a, male, child, along, with, a, similar, sounding, greek, roman, name, he, was, later, given, by, jesus, the, name, cephas, s, i, f, s, from, the, aramaic, kepha, rock, stone, in, translations, of, the, bible, from, the, original, greek, his, name, is, maintained, as, cephas, in, nine, occurrences, in, the, new, testament, whereas, in, the, vast, majority, of, mentions, 156, occurrences, in, the, new, testament, he, is, called, petros, from, the, greek, and, latin, word, for, a, rock, or, stone, petra, to, which, the, masculine, ending, was, added, rendered, into, english, as, peter, the, precise, meaning, of, the, aramaic, word, is, disputed, some, saying, that, its, usual, meaning, is, rock, or, crag, others, saying, that, it, means, rather, stone, and, particularly, in, its, application, by, jesus, to, simon, like, a, jewel, but, most, scholars, agree, that, as, a, proper, name, it, denotes, a, rough, or, tough, character, both, meanings, stone, jewel, or, hewn, stone, and, rock, are, indicated, in, dictionaries, of, aramaic, and, syriac, catholic, theologian, rudolf, pesch, argues, that, the, aramaic, word, would, mean, precious, stone, to, designate, a, distinguishing, person, this, cannot, be, sufficiently, proven, from, aramaic, however, since, the, use, of, the, aramaic, root, kp, as, a, personal, name, has, not, been, proven, and, there, are, hardly, any, known, examples, of, the, word, being, used, to, mean, precious, stone, the, combined, name, s, mon, p, tros, simon, peter, appears, 19, times, in, the, new, testament, in, some, syriac, documents, he, is, called, in, english, translation, simon, cephas, the, sources, used, to, reconstruct, the, life, of, peter, can, be, divided, in, three, groups, in, the, new, testament, he, is, among, the, first, of, the, disciples, called, during, jesus, ministry, peter, became, the, first, listed, apostle, ordained, by, jesus, in, the, early, church, peter, was, a, jewish, fisherman, in, bethsaida, john, 1, 44, he, was, named, simon, the, son, of, a, man, named, jonah, or, john, the, three, synoptic, gospels, recount, how, peter, s, mother, in, law, was, healed, by, jesus, at, their, home, in, capernaum, matthew, 8, 14, 17, mark, 1, 29, 31, luke, 4, 38, this, passage, clearly, depicts, peter, as, being, married, or, widowed, 1, corinthians, 9, 5, has, also, been, taken, to, imply, that, he, was, married, in, the, synoptic, gospels, peter, then, simon, was, a, fisherman, along, with, his, brother, andrew, and, the, sons, of, zebedee, james, and, john, the, gospel, of, john, also, depicts, peter, fishing, even, after, the, resurrection, of, jesus, in, the, story, of, the, catch, of, 153, fish, in, matthew, and, mark, jesus, called, simon, and, his, brother, andrew, to, be, fishers, of, men, matthew, 4, 18, 19, mark, 1, 16, 17, in, the, confession, of, peter, he, proclaims, jesus, to, be, the, christ, jewish, messiah, as, described, in, the, three, synoptic, gospels, matthew, 16, 13, 20, mark, 8, 27, 30, and, luke, 9, 18, 21, it, is, there, in, the, area, of, caesarea, philippi, that, he, receives, from, jesus, the, name, cephas, aramaic, kepha, or, peter, greek, petros, in, luke, simon, peter, owns, the, boat, that, jesus, uses, to, preach, to, the, multitudes, who, were, pressing, on, him, at, the, shore, of, lake, gennesaret, luke, 5, 3, jesus, then, amazes, simon, and, his, companions, james, and, john, andrew, is, not, mentioned, by, telling, them, to, lower, their, nets, whereupon, they, catch, a, huge, number, of, fish, immediately, after, this, they, follow, him, luke, 5, 4, 11, the, gospel, of, john, gives, a, comparable, account, of, the, first, disciples, john, 1, 35, 42, in, john, the, readers, are, told, that, it, was, two, disciples, of, john, the, baptist, andrew, and, an, unnamed, disciple, who, heard, john, the, baptist, announce, jesus, as, the, lamb, of, god, and, then, followed, jesus, andrew, then, went, to, his, brother, simon, saying, we, have, found, the, messiah, and, then, brought, simon, to, jesus, who, immediately, at, the, first, sight, of, him, named, him, as, cephas, john, 1, 42, three, of, the, four, gospels, matthew, mark, and, john, recount, the, story, of, jesus, walking, on, water, matthew, additionally, describes, peter, walking, on, water, for, a, moment, but, beginning, to, sink, when, his, faith, wavers, matthew, 14, 28, 31, at, the, beginning, of, the, last, supper, jesus, washed, his, disciples, feet, peter, initially, refused, to, let, jesus, wash, his, feet, but, when, jesus, told, him, if, i, wash, thee, not, thou, hast, no, part, with, me, peter, replied, lord, not, my, feet, only, but, also, my, hands, and, my, head, john, 13, 2, 11, the, washing, of, feet, is, often, repeated, in, the, service, of, worship, on, maundy, thursday, by, some, christian, denominations, the, three, synoptic, gospels, all, mention, that, when, jesus, was, arrested, one, of, his, companions, cut, off, the, ear, of, a, servant, of, the, high, priest, of, israel, matthew, 26, 51, mark, 14, 47, luke, 22, 50, the, gospel, of, john, also, includes, this, event, and, names, peter, as, the, swordsman, and, malchus, as, the, victim, john, 18, 10, luke, adds, that, jesus, touched, the, ear, and, miraculously, healed, it, luke, 22, 49, 51, this, healing, of, the, servant, s, ear, is, the, last, of, the, 37, miracles, attributed, to, jesus, in, the, bible, simon, peter, was, twice, arraigned, with, john, before, the, sanhedrin, and, directly, defied, them, acts, 4, 7, 22, acts, 5, 18, 42, peter, takes, a, missionary, journey, to, lydda, joppa, and, caesarea, acts, 9, 32, acts, 10, 2, at, joppa, peter, had, a, vision, given, him, from, god, which, allowed, for, the, eating, of, previously, unclean, animals, leading, the, early, believers, to, the, decision, to, evangelise, the, gentiles, acts, 10, simon, peter, applied, the, message, of, the, vision, on, clean, animals, to, the, gentiles, and, follows, his, meeting, with, cornelius, the, centurion, by, claiming, that, god, shows, no, partiality, according, to, the, acts, of, the, apostles, peter, and, john, were, sent, from, jerusalem, to, samaria, acts, 8, 14, peter, cephas, is, mentioned, briefly, in, the, opening, chapter, of, one, of, the, pauline, epistles, epistle, to, the, galatians, which, mentions, a, trip, by, paul, the, apostle, to, jerusalem, where, he, meets, peter, galatians, 1, 18, peter, features, again, in, galatians, fourteen, years, later, when, paul, now, with, barnabas, and, titus, returned, to, jerusalem, galatians, 2, 7, 9, when, peter, came, to, antioch, paul, opposed, peter, to, his, face, because, he, was, in, the, wrong, galatians, 2, 11, acts, 12, narrates, how, peter, who, was, in, jerusalem, was, put, into, prison, by, agrippa, i, ad, 42, 44, but, was, rescued, by, an, angel, after, his, liberation, peter, left, jerusalem, to, go, to, another, place, acts, 12, 1, 18, concerning, peter, s, subsequent, activity, there, is, no, further, connected, information, from, the, extant, sources, although, there, are, short, notices, of, certain, individual, episodes, of, his, later, life, synoptic, gospels, mention, that, peter, had, a, mother, in, law, at, the, time, he, joined, jesus, and, this, mother, in, law, was, healed, by, him, however, the, gospels, give, no, information, about, his, wife, clement, of, alexandria, claimed, his, wife, was, executed, for, her, faith, by, the, roman, authorities, but, does, not, specify, any, date, or, location, another, opinion, states, that, peter, s, wife, was, no, longer, alive, at, the, time, he, met, jesus, so, he, was, a, widower, the, gospels, and, acts, portray, peter, as, the, most, prominent, apostle, though, he, denied, jesus, three, times, during, the, events, of, the, crucifixion, according, to, the, christian, tradition, peter, was, the, first, disciple, to, whom, jesus, appeared, balancing, peter, s, denial, and, restoring, his, position, peter, is, regarded, as, the, first, leader, of, the, early, church, though, he, was, soon, eclipsed, in, this, leadership, by, james, the, just, the, brother, of, the, lord, because, peter, was, the, first, to, whom, jesus, appeared, the, leadership, of, peter, forms, the, basis, of, the, apostolic, succession, and, the, institutional, power, of, orthodoxy, as, the, heirs, of, peter, and, he, is, described, as, the, rock, on, which, the, church, will, be, built, peter, is, always, listed, first, among, the, twelve, apostles, in, the, gospels, and, in, the, book, of, acts, along, with, james, the, elder, and, john, he, formed, an, informal, triumvirate, within, the, twelve, apostles, jesus, allowed, them, to, be, the, only, apostles, present, at, three, particular, occasions, during, his, public, ministry, the, raising, of, jairus, daughter, transfiguration, of, jesus, and, agony, in, the, garden, of, gethsemane, peter, often, confesses, his, faith, in, jesus, as, the, messiah, peter, is, often, depicted, in, the, gospels, as, spokesman, of, all, the, apostles, john, vidmar, a, catholic, scholar, writes, catholic, scholars, agree, that, peter, had, an, authority, that, superseded, that, of, the, other, apostles, peter, is, their, spokesman, at, several, events, he, conducts, the, election, of, matthias, his, opinion, in, the, debate, over, converting, gentiles, was, crucial, etc, the, author, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, portrays, peter, as, the, central, figure, within, the, early, christian, community, all, four, canonical, gospels, recount, that, during, the, last, supper, jesus, foretold, that, peter, would, deny, him, three, times, before, the, following, cockcrow, before, the, cock, crows, twice, in, mark, s, account, the, three, synoptics, and, john, describe, the, three, denials, as, follows, in, the, gospel, of, luke, is, a, record, of, christ, telling, peter, simon, simon, behold, satan, hath, desired, to, have, you, that, he, may, sift, you, as, wheat, but, i, have, prayed, for, thee, that, thy, faith, fail, not, and, when, thou, art, converted, strengthen, thy, brethren, in, a, reminiscent, scene, in, john, s, epilogue, peter, affirms, three, times, that, he, loves, jesus, paul, s, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, contains, a, list, of, resurrection, appearances, of, jesus, the, first, of, which, is, an, appearance, to, peter, here, paul, apparently, follows, an, early, tradition, that, peter, was, the, first, to, see, the, risen, christ, which, however, did, not, seem, to, have, survived, to, the, time, when, the, gospels, were, written, in, john, s, gospel, peter, is, the, first, person, to, enter, the, empty, tomb, although, the, women, and, the, beloved, disciple, see, it, before, him, in, luke, s, account, the, women, s, report, of, the, empty, tomb, is, dismissed, by, the, apostles, and, peter, is, the, only, one, who, goes, to, check, for, himself, running, to, the, tomb, after, seeing, the, graveclothes, he, goes, home, apparently, without, informing, the, other, disciples, in, the, final, chapter, of, the, gospel, of, john, peter, in, one, of, the, resurrection, appearances, of, jesus, three, times, affirmed, his, love, for, jesus, balancing, his, threefold, denial, and, jesus, reconfirmed, peter, s, position, the, church, of, the, primacy, of, st, peter, on, the, sea, of, galilee, is, seen, as, the, traditional, site, where, jesus, christ, appeared, to, his, disciples, after, his, resurrection, and, according, to, catholic, tradition, established, peter, s, supreme, jurisdiction, over, the, christian, church, peter, was, considered, along, with, james, the, just, and, john, the, apostle, as, the, three, pillars, of, the, church, legitimised, by, jesus, appearance, peter, assumed, leadership, of, the, group, of, early, followers, forming, the, jerusalem, ekkl, sia, mentioned, by, paul, he, was, soon, eclipsed, in, this, leadership, by, james, the, just, the, brother, of, the, lord, according, to, l, demann, this, was, due, to, the, discussions, about, the, strictness, of, adherence, to, the, jewish, law, when, the, more, conservative, faction, of, james, the, just, took, the, overhand, over, the, more, liberal, position, of, peter, who, soon, lost, influence, according, to, methodist, historian, james, d, g, dunn, this, was, not, a, usurpation, of, power, but, a, consequence, of, peter, s, involvement, in, missionary, activities, the, early, church, historian, eusebius, c, ad, 325, records, clement, of, alexandria, c, ad, 190, as, saying, for, they, say, that, peter, and, james, the, greater, and, john, after, the, ascension, of, our, saviour, as, if, also, preferred, by, our, lord, strove, not, after, honor, but, chose, james, the, just, bishop, of, jerusalem, dunn, proposes, that, peter, was, a, bridge, man, between, the, opposing, views, of, paul, and, james, the, just, for, peter, was, probably, in, fact, and, effect, the, bridge, man, pontifex, maximus, who, did, more, than, any, other, to, hold, together, the, diversity, of, first, century, christianity, james, the, brother, of, jesus, and, paul, the, two, other, most, prominent, leading, figures, in, first, century, christianity, were, too, much, identified, with, their, respective, brands, of, christianity, at, least, in, the, eyes, of, christians, at, the, opposite, ends, of, this, particular, spectrum, paul, affirms, that, peter, had, the, special, charge, of, being, apostle, to, the, jews, just, as, he, paul, was, apostle, to, the, gentiles, some, argue, james, the, just, was, bishop, of, jerusalem, whilst, peter, was, bishop, of, rome, and, that, this, position, at, times, gave, james, privilege, in, some, but, not, all, situations, in, a, dialogue, between, jesus, and, his, disciples, matthew, 16, 13, 19, jesus, asks, who, do, people, say, that, the, son, of, man, is, the, disciples, give, various, answers, when, he, asks, who, do, you, say, that, i, am, simon, peter, answers, you, are, the, messiah, the, son, of, the, living, god, jesus, then, declares, blessed, are, you, simon, son, of, jonah, for, this, was, not, revealed, to, you, by, flesh, and, blood, but, by, my, father, in, heaven, and, i, tell, you, that, you, are, cephas, peter, petros, and, on, this, rock, petra, i, will, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hades, will, not, overcome, it, i, will, give, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, whatever, you, bind, on, earth, will, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatever, you, loose, on, earth, will, be, loosed, in, heaven, a, common, view, of, peter, is, provided, by, jesuit, father, daniel, j, harrington, who, suggests, that, peter, was, an, unlikely, symbol, of, stability, while, he, was, one, of, the, first, disciples, called, and, was, the, spokesman, for, the, group, peter, is, also, the, exemplar, of, little, faith, in, matthew, 14, peter, will, soon, have, jesus, say, to, him, o, you, of, little, faith, why, did, you, doubt, and, he, will, eventually, deny, jesus, three, times, thus, in, light, of, the, easter, event, peter, became, an, exemplar, of, the, forgiven, sinner, outside, the, catholic, church, opinions, vary, as, to, the, interpretation, of, this, passage, with, respect, to, what, authority, and, responsibility, if, any, jesus, was, giving, to, peter, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, this, passage, is, interpreted, as, not, implying, a, special, prominence, to, the, person, of, peter, but, to, peter, s, position, as, representative, of, the, apostles, the, word, used, for, rock, petra, grammatically, refers, to, a, small, detachment, of, the, massive, ledge, not, to, a, massive, boulder, thus, orthodox, sacred, tradition, understands, jesus, words, as, referring, to, the, apostolic, faith, petros, had, not, previously, been, used, as, a, name, but, in, the, greek, speaking, world, it, became, a, popular, christian, name, after, the, tradition, of, peter, s, prominence, in, the, early, christian, church, had, been, established, the, leadership, of, peter, forms, the, basis, of, the, apostolic, succession, and, the, institutional, power, of, orthodoxy, as, the, heirs, of, peter, and, is, described, as, the, rock, on, which, the, church, will, be, built, catholics, refer, to, him, as, chief, of, the, apostles, as, do, the, eastern, orthodox, and, the, oriental, orthodox, in, coptic, orthodox, church, liturgy, he, is, once, referred, to, as, prominent, or, head, among, the, apostles, a, title, shared, with, paul, in, the, text, the, fraction, of, fast, and, feast, of, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, in, the, coptic, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, some, including, the, orthodox, churches, believe, this, is, not, the, same, as, saying, that, the, other, apostles, were, under, peter, s, orders, according, to, the, epistle, to, the, galatians, 2, 11, peter, went, to, antioch, where, paul, rebuked, him, for, following, the, conservative, line, regarding, the, conversion, of, gentiles, having, meals, separate, from, gentiles, subsequent, tradition, held, that, peter, had, been, the, first, patriarch, of, antioch, according, to, the, writings, of, origen, and, eusebius, in, his, church, history, iii, 36, peter, had, founded, the, church, of, antioch, later, accounts, expand, on, the, brief, biblical, mention, of, his, visit, to, antioch, the, liber, pontificalis, 9th, century, mentions, peter, as, having, served, as, bishop, of, antioch, for, seven, years, and, having, potentially, left, his, family, in, the, greek, city, before, his, journey, to, rome, claims, of, direct, blood, lineage, from, simon, peter, among, the, old, population, of, antioch, existed, in, the, 1st, century, and, continue, to, exist, today, notably, by, certain, semaan, families, of, modern, day, syria, and, lebanon, historians, have, furnished, other, evidence, of, peter, s, sojourn, in, antioch, the, clementine, literature, a, group, of, related, works, written, in, the, fourth, century, but, believed, to, contain, materials, from, earlier, centuries, relates, information, about, peter, that, may, come, from, earlier, traditions, one, is, that, peter, had, a, group, of, 12, to, 16, followers, whom, the, clementine, writings, name, another, is, that, it, provides, an, itinerary, of, peter, s, route, from, caesarea, maritima, to, antioch, where, he, debated, his, adversary, simon, magus, during, this, journey, he, ordained, zacchaeus, as, the, first, bishop, of, caesarea, and, maro, as, the, first, bishop, of, tripolis, historian, fred, lapham, suggests, the, route, recorded, in, the, clementine, writings, may, have, been, taken, from, an, earlier, document, mentioned, by, epiphanius, of, salamis, in, his, panarion, called, the, itinerary, of, peter, peter, may, have, visited, corinth, and, maybe, there, existed, a, party, of, cephas, first, corinthians, suggests, that, perhaps, peter, visited, the, city, of, corinth, located, in, greece, during, their, missions, dionysius, bishop, of, corinth, in, his, epistle, to, the, roman, church, under, pope, soter, a, d, 165, 174, declares, that, peter, and, paul, founded, the, church, of, rome, and, the, church, of, corinth, and, they, have, lived, in, corinth, for, some, time, and, finally, in, italy, where, they, found, death, you, have, thus, by, such, an, admonition, bound, together, the, planting, of, peter, and, of, paul, at, rome, and, corinth, for, both, of, them, planted, and, likewise, taught, us, in, our, corinth, and, they, taught, together, in, like, manner, in, italy, and, suffered, martyrdom, at, the, same, time, the, catholic, church, speaks, of, the, pope, the, bishop, of, rome, as, the, successor, of, saint, peter, this, is, often, interpreted, to, imply, that, peter, was, the, first, bishop, of, rome, however, it, is, also, said, that, the, institution, of, the, papacy, is, not, dependent, on, the, idea, that, peter, was, bishop, of, rome, or, even, on, his, ever, having, been, in, rome, according, to, book, iii, chapter, 3, of, against, heresies, 180, ad, by, irenaeus, of, lyons, linus, was, named, as, peter, s, successor, and, is, recognised, by, the, catholic, church, as, the, second, bishop, of, rome, pope, followed, by, anacletus, clement, of, rome, evaristus, alexander, sixtus, telesphorus, hyginus, pius, anicetus, soter, and, eleutherius, in, his, book, church, history, eusebius, notes, that, linus, succeeded, peter, as, the, bishop, of, the, church, in, rome, as, to, the, rest, of, his, followers, paul, testifies, that, crescens, was, sent, to, gaul, but, linus, whom, he, mentions, in, the, second, epistle, to, timothy, as, his, companion, at, rome, was, peter, s, successor, in, the, episcopate, of, the, church, there, as, has, already, been, shown, according, to, tertullian, s, book, prescription, against, heretics, it, is, stated, that, clement, was, ordained, by, peter, as, the, bishop, of, rome, as, also, the, church, of, rome, which, makes, clement, to, have, been, ordained, in, like, manner, by, peter, st, clement, of, rome, identifies, peter, and, paul, as, the, outstanding, heroes, of, the, faith, there, is, no, obvious, biblical, evidence, that, peter, was, ever, in, rome, but, the, first, epistle, of, peter, does, mention, that, the, church, that, is, at, babylon, elected, together, with, you, saluteth, you, and, so, doth, marcus, my, son, most, scholars, agree, that, the, city, alluded, to, in, this, verse, is, rome, for, which, babylon, was, a, common, nickname, in, jewish, and, christian, literature, at, the, time, paul, s, epistle, to, the, romans, written, about, ad, 57, greets, some, fifty, people, in, rome, by, name, but, not, peter, whom, he, knew, there, is, also, no, mention, of, peter, in, rome, later, during, paul, s, two, year, stay, there, in, acts, 28, about, ad, 60, 62, with, regards, to, the, latter, acts, 28, does, not, specifically, mention, any, of, paul, s, visitors, the, writings, of, the, 1st, century, church, father, ignatius, of, antioch, c, 35, c, 107, refer, to, peter, and, paul, giving, admonitions, to, the, romans, indicating, peter, s, presence, in, rome, irenaeus, of, lyons, c, 130, c, 202, wrote, in, the, 2nd, century, that, peter, and, paul, had, been, the, founders, of, the, church, in, rome, and, had, appointed, linus, as, succeeding, bishop, clement, of, alexandria, c, 150, c, 215, states, that, peter, had, preached, the, word, publicly, at, rome, a, d, 190, according, to, origen, 184, 253, and, eusebius, peter, after, having, first, founded, the, church, at, antioch, went, away, to, rome, preaching, the, gospel, and, he, also, after, the, church, in, antioch, presided, over, that, of, rome, until, his, death, after, presiding, over, the, church, in, antioch, for, a, while, peter, would, have, been, succeeded, by, evodius, and, thereafter, by, ignatius, who, was, a, disciple, of, john, the, apostle, lactantius, in, his, book, called, of, the, manner, in, which, the, persecutors, died, written, around, 318, noted, that, and, while, nero, reigned, the, apostle, peter, came, to, rome, and, through, the, power, of, god, committed, unto, him, wrought, certain, miracles, and, by, turning, many, to, the, true, religion, built, up, a, faithful, and, stedfast, temple, unto, the, lord, eusebius, of, caesarea, 260, 265, 339, 340, relates, that, when, peter, confronts, simon, magus, at, judea, mentioned, in, acts, 8, simon, magus, flees, to, rome, where, the, romans, began, to, regard, him, as, a, god, according, to, eusebius, his, luck, did, not, last, long, since, god, sent, peter, to, rome, and, simon, was, quenched, and, immediately, destroyed, according, to, jerome, 327, 420, peter, went, to, rome, in, the, second, year, of, claudius, to, overthrow, simon, magus, and, held, the, sacerdotal, chair, there, for, twenty, five, years, until, the, last, that, is, the, fourteenth, year, of, nero, an, apocryphal, work, the, actus, vercellenses, 7th, century, a, latin, text, preserved, in, only, one, manuscript, copy, published, widely, in, translation, under, the, title, acts, of, peter, sets, peter, s, confrontation, with, simon, magus, in, rome, in, the, epilogue, of, the, gospel, of, john, jesus, hints, at, the, death, by, which, peter, would, glorify, god, saying, but, when, you, grow, old, you, will, stretch, out, your, hands, and, someone, else, will, fasten, a, belt, around, you, and, take, you, where, you, do, not, wish, to, go, this, is, interpreted, by, some, as, a, reference, to, peter, s, crucifixion, unitarian, theologian, donald, fay, robinson, has, suggested, that, the, incident, in, acts, 12, 1, 17, where, peter, is, released, by, an, angel, and, goes, to, another, place, really, represents, an, idealised, account, of, his, death, which, may, have, occurred, in, a, jerusalem, prison, as, early, as, ad, 44, early, church, tradition, says, that, peter, died, by, crucifixion, with, arms, outstretched, at, the, time, of, the, great, fire, of, rome, in, the, year, 64, this, probably, took, place, three, months, after, the, disastrous, fire, that, destroyed, rome, for, which, the, emperor, nero, wished, to, blame, the, christians, this, dies, imperii, regnal, day, anniversary, was, an, important, one, exactly, ten, years, after, nero, ascended, to, the, throne, and, it, was, as, usual, accompanied, by, much, bloodshed, traditionally, roman, authorities, sentenced, him, to, death, by, crucifixion, at, vatican, hill, in, accordance, with, the, apocryphal, acts, of, peter, he, was, crucified, head, down, tradition, also, locates, his, burial, place, where, the, basilica, of, saint, peter, was, later, built, directly, beneath, the, basilica, s, high, altar, pope, clement, i, d, 99, in, his, letter, to, the, corinthians, chapter, 5, written, c, 80, 98, speaks, of, peter, s, martyrdom, in, the, following, terms, let, us, take, the, noble, examples, of, our, own, generation, through, jealousy, and, envy, the, greatest, and, most, just, pillars, of, the, church, were, persecuted, and, came, even, unto, death, peter, through, unjust, envy, endured, not, one, or, two, but, many, labours, and, at, last, having, delivered, his, testimony, departed, unto, the, place, of, glory, due, to, him, the, apocryphal, acts, of, peter, 2nd, cent, vercelli, acts, xxxv, is, the, source, for, the, tradition, about, the, famous, latin, phrase, quo, vadis, domine, in, greek, kyrie, pou, hypageis, which, means, where, are, you, going, lord, according, to, the, story, peter, fleeing, rome, to, avoid, execution, meets, the, risen, jesus, in, the, latin, translation, peter, asks, jesus, quo, vadis, he, replies, romam, eo, iterum, crucifigi, i, am, going, to, rome, to, be, crucified, again, peter, then, gains, the, courage, to, continue, his, ministry, and, returns, to, the, city, where, he, is, martyred, this, story, is, commemorated, in, an, annibale, carracci, painting, the, church, of, quo, vadis, near, the, catacombs, of, saint, callistus, contains, a, stone, in, which, jesus, footprints, from, this, event, are, supposedly, preserved, though, this, was, apparently, an, ex, voto, from, a, pilgrim, and, indeed, a, copy, of, the, original, housed, in, the, basilica, of, st, sebastian, the, death, of, peter, is, attested, to, by, tertullian, c, 155, c, 240, at, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, in, his, prescription, against, heretics, noting, that, peter, endured, a, passion, like, his, lord, s, how, happy, is, that, church, where, peter, endured, a, passion, like, that, of, the, lord, where, paul, was, crowned, in, a, death, like, john, s, the, statement, implies, that, peter, was, killed, like, jesus, by, crucifixion, and, paul, was, killed, like, john, by, beheading, it, gives, the, impression, that, peter, also, died, in, rome, since, paul, also, died, there, in, his, work, scorpiace, 15, he, also, speaks, of, peter, s, crucifixion, the, budding, faith, nero, first, made, bloody, in, rome, there, peter, was, girded, by, another, since, he, was, bound, to, the, cross, origen, 184, 253, in, his, commentary, on, the, book, of, genesis, iii, quoted, by, eusebius, in, his, ecclesiastical, history, iii, 1, said, peter, was, crucified, at, rome, with, his, head, downwards, as, he, himself, had, desired, to, suffer, the, cross, of, st, peter, inverts, the, latin, cross, based, on, this, refusal, and, on, his, claim, of, being, unworthy, to, die, the, same, way, as, his, saviour, peter, of, alexandria, d, 311, who, was, bishop, of, alexandria, and, died, around, ad, 311, wrote, an, epistle, on, penance, in, which, he, says, peter, the, first, of, the, apostles, having, been, often, apprehended, and, thrown, into, prison, and, treated, with, ignominy, was, last, of, all, crucified, at, rome, jerome, 327, 420, wrote, that, at, nero, s, hands, peter, received, the, crown, of, martyrdom, being, nailed, to, the, cross, with, his, head, towards, the, ground, and, his, feet, raised, on, high, asserting, that, he, was, unworthy, to, be, crucified, in, the, same, manner, as, his, lord, according, to, jerome, and, eusebius, peter, died, in, the, year, ad, 67, 68, twenty, five, years, after, his, arrival, in, rome, in, ad, 42, some, modern, scholars, argue, for, a, date, between, the, years, ad, 64, 68, the, liber, pontificalis, also, gives, him, a, tenure, of, 25, years, and, adds, that, he, died, in, the, 38th, year, after, the, death, of, jesus, which, reckoning, from, ad, 30, also, gives, ad, 67, 68, however, it, also, explicitly, states, that, pope, linus, succedded, him, in, the, year, ad, 56, which, is, the, result, of, mixing, two, contradictory, traditions, catholic, tradition, holds, that, peter, s, inverted, crucifixion, occurred, in, the, gardens, of, nero, with, the, burial, in, saint, peter, s, tomb, nearby, caius, in, his, disputation, against, proclus, a, d, 198, preserved, in, part, by, eusebius, relates, this, of, the, places, in, which, the, remains, of, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, were, deposited, i, can, point, out, the, trophies, of, the, apostles, for, if, you, are, willing, to, go, to, the, vatican, or, to, the, ostian, way, you, will, find, the, trophies, of, those, who, founded, this, church, according, to, jerome, in, his, work, de, viris, illustribus, a, d, 392, peter, was, buried, at, rome, in, the, vatican, near, the, triumphal, way, where, he, is, venerated, by, the, whole, world, the, liber, pontificalis, states, that, he, was, buried, on, june, 29th, the, corrupted, liberian, catalogue, gives, it, as, the, date, of, his, death, some, authors, have, argued, that, the, date, was, deliberately, chosen, to, replace, an, old, roman, festival, but, this, seems, unlikely, in, the, early, 4th, century, the, emperor, constantine, i, decided, to, honour, peter, with, a, large, basilica, because, the, precise, location, of, peter, s, burial, was, so, firmly, fixed, in, the, belief, of, the, christians, of, rome, the, church, to, house, the, basilica, had, to, be, erected, on, a, site, that, was, not, convenient, to, construction, the, slope, of, the, vatican, hill, had, to, be, excavated, even, though, the, church, could, much, more, easily, have, been, built, on, level, ground, only, slightly, to, the, south, there, were, also, moral, and, legal, issues, such, as, demolishing, a, cemetery, to, make, room, for, the, building, the, focal, point, of, the, basilica, both, in, its, original, form, and, in, its, later, complete, reconstruction, is, the, altar, located, over, what, is, said, to, be, the, point, of, peter, s, burial, according, to, a, letter, quoted, by, bede, pope, vitalian, sent, a, cross, containing, filings, said, to, be, from, peter, s, chains, to, the, queen, of, oswy, anglo, saxon, king, of, northumbria, in, 665, as, well, as, unspecified, relics, of, the, saint, to, the, king, the, skull, of, saint, peter, is, claimed, to, reside, in, the, archbasilica, of, saint, john, lateran, since, at, least, the, ninth, century, alongside, the, skull, of, saint, paul, in, 1950, human, bones, were, found, buried, underneath, the, altar, of, st, peter, s, basilica, the, bones, have, been, claimed, by, many, to, have, been, those, of, peter, an, attempt, to, contradict, these, claims, was, made, in, 1953, by, the, excavation, of, what, some, believe, to, be, saint, peter, s, tomb, in, jerusalem, however, along, with, this, supposed, tomb, in, jerusalem, bearing, his, previous, name, simon, but, not, peter, tombs, bearing, the, names, of, jesus, mary, james, john, and, the, rest, of, the, apostles, were, also, found, at, the, same, excavation, though, all, these, names, were, very, common, among, jews, at, the, time, in, the, 1960s, items, from, the, excavations, beneath, st, peter, s, basilica, were, re, examined, and, the, bones, of, a, male, person, were, identified, a, forensic, examination, found, them, to, be, a, male, of, about, 61, years, of, age, from, the, 1st, century, this, caused, pope, paul, vi, in, 1968, to, announce, them, most, likely, to, be, the, relics, of, apostle, peter, on, 24, november, 2013, pope, francis, presented, part, of, the, relics, consisting, of, bone, fragments, for, the, first, time, in, public, during, a, mass, celebrated, in, st, peter, s, square, on, 2, july, 2019, it, was, announced, that, pope, francis, had, transferred, nine, of, these, bone, fragments, within, a, bronze, reliquary, to, orthodox, ecumenical, patriarch, bartholomew, of, constantinople, bartholomew, who, serves, as, head, of, the, eastern, orthodox, christian, church, described, the, gesture, as, brave, and, bold, pope, francis, has, said, his, decision, was, born, out, of, prayer, and, intended, as, a, sign, of, the, ongoing, work, towards, communion, between, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, the, majority, of, saint, peter, s, remains, however, are, still, preserved, in, rome, under, the, high, altar, of, st, peter, s, basilica, some, church, historians, consider, peter, and, paul, to, have, been, martyred, under, the, reign, of, nero, around, ad, 65, after, the, great, fire, of, rome, currently, most, catholic, scholars, and, many, scholars, in, general, hold, the, view, that, peter, was, martyred, in, rome, under, nero, while, accepting, that, peter, came, to, rome, and, was, martyred, there, there, is, no, historical, evidence, that, he, held, episcopal, office, there, according, to, two, studies, published, by, the, german, philologist, otto, zwierlein, in, 2009, and, 2013, respectively, there, is, not, a, single, piece, of, reliable, literary, evidence, and, no, archaeological, evidence, either, that, peter, ever, was, in, rome, timothy, barnes, has, criticised, zwierlein, s, views, as, a, nadir, in, historical, criticism, clement, of, rome, s, first, letter, a, document, that, has, been, dated, from, the, 90s, to, the, 120s, is, one, of, the, earliest, sources, adduced, in, support, of, peter, s, stay, in, rome, but, zwierlein, questions, the, text, s, authenticity, and, whether, it, has, any, knowledge, about, peter, s, life, beyond, what, is, contained, in, the, new, testament, acts, of, the, apostles, the, letter, also, does, not, mention, any, particular, place, only, saying, peter, through, unrighteous, envy, endured, not, one, or, two, but, numerous, labours, and, when, he, had, at, length, suffered, martyrdom, departed, to, the, place, of, glory, due, to, him, ch, 5, a, letter, to, the, romans, attributed, to, ignatius, of, antioch, might, imply, that, peter, and, paul, had, special, authority, over, the, roman, church, telling, the, roman, christians, i, do, not, command, you, as, peter, and, paul, did, ch, 4, although, zwierlein, says, he, could, be, simply, referring, to, the, epistles, of, the, apostles, or, their, mission, work, in, the, city, not, a, special, authority, given, or, bestowed, zwierlein, questions, the, authenticity, of, this, document, and, its, traditional, dating, to, c, 105, 10, saying, it, may, date, from, the, final, decades, of, the, 2nd, century, instead, of, from, the, beginning, the, ancient, historian, josephus, describes, how, roman, soldiers, would, amuse, themselves, by, crucifying, criminals, in, different, positions, and, it, is, likely, that, this, would, have, been, known, to, the, author, of, the, acts, of, peter, the, position, attributed, to, peter, s, crucifixion, is, thus, plausible, either, as, having, happened, historically, or, as, being, an, invention, by, the, author, of, the, acts, of, peter, death, after, crucifixion, head, down, is, unlikely, to, be, caused, by, suffocation, the, usual, cause, of, death, in, ordinary, crucifixion, church, tradition, ascribes, the, epistles, first, and, second, peter, to, the, apostle, peter, as, does, the, text, of, second, peter, itself, an, attribution, rejected, by, scholarship, first, peter, says, the, author, is, in, babylon, which, has, been, held, to, be, a, coded, reference, to, rome, early, church, tradition, reports, that, peter, wrote, from, rome, eusebius, of, caesarea, states, clement, of, alexandria, in, the, sixth, of, the, hypotyposeis, cites, the, story, and, the, bishop, of, hierapolis, named, papias, joins, him, in, testifying, that, peter, mentions, mark, in, the, first, epistle, which, they, say, he, composed, in, rome, herself, and, that, he, indicates, this, calling, the, city, more, figuratively, babylon, by, these, she, who, is, in, babylon, chosen, together, with, you, sends, you, greetings, and, so, does, my, son, mark, 1, pet, 5, 13, if, the, reference, is, to, rome, it, is, the, only, biblical, reference, to, peter, being, there, many, scholars, regard, both, first, and, second, peter, as, not, having, been, authored, by, him, partly, because, other, parts, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, seem, to, describe, peter, as, an, illiterate, fisherman, most, biblical, scholars, believe, that, babylon, is, a, metaphor, for, the, pagan, roman, empire, at, the, time, it, persecuted, christians, before, the, edict, of, milan, in, 313, perhaps, specifically, referencing, some, aspect, of, rome, s, rule, brutality, greed, paganism, although, most, scholars, recognise, that, babylon, is, a, metaphor, for, rome, some, also, claim, that, babylon, represents, more, than, the, roman, city, of, the, first, century, according, to, lutheran, scholar, on, revelation, craig, r, koester, the, whore, is, rome, yet, more, than, rome, it, is, the, roman, imperial, world, which, in, turn, represents, the, world, alienated, from, god, at, that, time, in, history, the, ancient, city, of, babylon, was, no, longer, of, any, importance, e, g, strabo, wrote, the, greater, part, of, babylon, is, so, deserted, that, one, would, not, hesitate, to, say, the, great, city, is, a, great, desert, another, theory, is, that, babylon, refers, to, the, babylon, in, egypt, that, was, an, important, fortress, city, in, egypt, just, north, of, today, s, cairo, and, this, combined, with, the, greetings, from, mark, 1, peter, 5, 13, who, may, be, mark, the, evangelist, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, church, of, alexandria, egypt, has, led, some, scholars, to, regard, the, first, peter, epistle, as, having, been, written, in, egypt, the, roman, martyrology, assigns, 29, june, as, the, feast, day, of, both, peter, and, paul, without, thereby, declaring, that, to, be, the, day, of, their, deaths, augustine, of, hippo, says, in, his, sermon, 295, one, day, is, assigned, for, the, celebration, of, the, martyrdom, of, the, two, apostles, but, those, two, were, one, although, their, martyrdom, occurred, on, different, days, they, were, one, this, is, also, the, feast, of, both, apostles, in, the, calendar, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, the, roman, rite, the, feast, of, the, chair, of, saint, peter, is, celebrated, on, 22, february, and, the, anniversary, of, the, dedication, of, the, two, papal, basilicas, of, saint, peter, s, and, saint, paul, outside, the, walls, is, held, on, 18, november, before, pope, john, xxiii, s, revision, in, 1960, the, roman, calendar, also, included, on, 18, january, another, feast, of, the, chair, of, saint, peter, denominated, the, chair, of, saint, peter, in, rome, while, the, february, feast, was, then, called, that, of, the, chair, of, saint, peter, at, antioch, and, on, 1, august, the, feast, of, saint, peter, in, chains, in, the, orthodox, daily, office, every, thursday, throughout, the, year, is, dedicated, to, the, holy, apostles, including, st, peter, there, are, also, three, feast, days, in, the, year, which, are, dedicated, to, him, peter, is, remembered, with, paul, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, festival, on, 29, june, peter, the, apostle, may, be, celebrated, alone, without, paul, on, 29, june, christians, of, different, theological, backgrounds, are, in, disagreement, as, to, the, exact, significance, of, peter, s, ministry, for, instance, similarly, historians, of, various, backgrounds, also, offer, differing, interpretations, of, the, apostle, s, presence, in, rome, according, to, catholic, belief, simon, peter, was, distinguished, by, jesus, to, hold, the, first, place, of, honor, and, authority, also, in, catholic, belief, peter, was, as, the, first, bishop, of, rome, the, first, pope, furthermore, they, consider, every, pope, to, be, peter, s, successor, and, the, rightful, superior, of, all, other, bishops, however, peter, never, bore, the, title, of, pope, or, vicar, of, christ, the, catholic, church, s, recognition, of, peter, as, head, of, its, church, on, earth, with, christ, being, its, heavenly, head, is, based, on, its, interpretation, of, passages, from, the, canonical, gospels, of, the, new, testament, as, well, as, sacred, tradition, the, first, passage, is, john, 21, 15, 17, which, is, feed, my, lambs, tend, my, sheep, feed, my, sheep, within, the, greek, it, is, i, e, to, feed, and, rule, v, 16, while, i, e, to, feed, for, v, 15, v, 17, which, is, seen, by, catholics, as, christ, promising, the, spiritual, supremacy, to, peter, the, catholic, encyclopedia, of, 1913, sees, in, this, passage, jesus, charging, with, the, superintendency, of, all, his, sheep, without, exception, and, consequently, of, his, whole, flock, that, is, of, his, own, church, in, this, passage, the, evangelist, writes, first, simon, called, peter, the, greek, word, for, first, protos, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, can, mean, primacy, in, foundation, not, just, in, a, numerical, sense, another, passage, is, matthew, 16, 18, i, tell, you, that, you, are, peter, and, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hell, will, not, overcome, it, i, will, give, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, whatever, you, bind, on, earth, will, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatever, you, loose, on, earth, will, be, loosed, in, heaven, in, the, story, of, the, calling, of, the, disciples, jesus, addresses, simon, peter, with, the, greek, term, cephas, a, hellenised, form, of, aramaic, keepa, which, means, rock, a, term, that, before, was, not, used, as, a, proper, name, jesus, later, alludes, to, this, nickname, after, peter, declares, jesus, to, be, the, messiah, the, peshitta, syriac, version, renders, jesus, words, into, aramaic, as, follows, paul, of, tarsus, later, uses, the, appellation, cephas, in, reference, to, peter, to, better, understand, what, christ, meant, st, basil, elaborates, though, peter, be, a, rock, yet, he, is, not, a, rock, as, christ, is, for, christ, is, the, true, unmoveable, rock, of, himself, peter, is, unmoveable, by, christ, the, rock, for, jesus, doth, communicate, and, impart, his, dignities, not, voiding, himself, of, them, but, holding, them, to, himself, bestoweth, them, also, upon, others, he, is, the, light, and, yet, you, are, the, light, he, is, the, priest, and, yet, he, maketh, priests, he, is, the, rock, and, he, made, a, rock, in, reference, to, peter, s, occupation, before, becoming, an, apostle, the, popes, wear, the, fisherman, s, ring, which, bears, an, image, of, the, saint, casting, his, nets, from, a, fishing, boat, the, keys, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, pope, s, authority, refer, to, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, promised, to, peter, the, terminology, of, this, commission, of, peter, is, unmistakably, parallel, to, the, commissioning, of, eliakim, ben, hilkiah, in, isaiah, 22, 15, 23, peter, is, often, depicted, in, both, western, and, eastern, christian, art, holding, a, key, or, a, set, of, keys, in, the, original, greek, the, word, translated, as, peter, is, petros, and, that, translated, as, rock, is, petra, two, words, that, while, not, identical, give, an, impression, of, one, of, many, times, when, jesus, used, a, play, on, words, furthermore, since, jesus, presumably, spoke, to, peter, in, their, native, aramaic, language, he, would, have, used, kepha, in, both, instances, the, peshitta, text, and, the, old, syriac, texts, use, the, word, kepha, for, both, peter, and, rock, in, matthew, 16, 18, john, 1, 42, says, jesus, called, simon, cephas, as, paul, calls, him, in, some, letters, he, was, instructed, by, christ, to, strengthen, his, brethren, i, e, the, apostles, peter, also, had, a, leadership, role, in, the, early, christian, church, at, jerusalem, according, to, the, acts, of, the, apostles, chapters, 1, 2, 10, 11, and, 15, early, catholic, latin, and, greek, writers, such, as, st, john, chrysostom, considered, the, foundation, rock, as, applying, to, both, peter, personally, and, his, confession, of, faith, or, the, faith, of, his, confession, symbolically, as, well, as, seeing, christ, s, promise, to, apply, more, generally, to, his, twelve, apostles, and, the, church, at, large, this, double, meaning, interpretation, is, present, in, the, current, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, protestant, arguments, against, the, catholic, interpretation, are, largely, based, on, the, difference, between, the, greek, words, translated, rock, in, the, matthean, passage, they, often, claim, that, in, classical, attic, greek, petros, masculine, generally, meant, pebble, while, petra, feminine, meant, boulder, or, cliff, and, accordingly, taking, peter, s, name, to, mean, pebble, they, argue, that, the, rock, in, question, cannot, have, been, peter, but, something, else, either, jesus, himself, or, the, faith, in, jesus, that, peter, had, just, professed, these, popular, level, writings, are, disputed, in, similar, popular, level, catholic, writings, the, new, testament, was, written, in, koin, greek, not, attic, greek, and, some, authorities, say, no, significant, difference, existed, between, the, meanings, of, petros, and, petra, so, far, from, meaning, a, pebble, was, the, word, petros, that, apollonius, rhodius, a, writer, of, koin, greek, of, the, third, century, b, c, used, it, to, refer, to, a, huge, round, boulder, a, terrible, quoit, of, ares, enyalius, four, stalwart, youths, could, not, have, raised, it, from, the, ground, even, a, little, the, feminine, noun, petra, in, greek, translated, as, rock, in, the, phrase, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, is, also, used, at, 1, cor, 10, 4, in, describing, jesus, christ, which, reads, they, all, ate, the, same, spiritual, food, and, drank, the, same, spiritual, drink, for, they, drank, from, the, spiritual, rock, that, accompanied, them, and, that, rock, was, christ, although, matthew, 16, is, used, as, a, primary, proof, text, for, the, catholic, doctrine, of, papal, supremacy, some, protestant, scholars, say, that, prior, to, the, reformation, of, the, 16th, century, matthew, 16, was, very, rarely, used, to, support, papal, claims, despite, it, being, well, documented, as, being, used, in, the, 3rd, century, by, stephen, of, rome, against, cyprian, of, carriage, in, a, passionate, disagreement, about, baptism, and, in, the, 4th, century, by, pope, damasus, as, a, claim, to, primacy, as, a, lesson, of, the, arian, controversy, for, stricter, discipline, and, centralised, control, their, position, is, that, most, of, the, early, and, medieval, church, interpreted, the, rock, as, being, a, reference, either, to, christ, or, to, peter, s, faith, not, peter, himself, they, understand, jesus, remark, to, have, been, his, affirmation, of, peter, s, testimony, that, jesus, was, the, son, of, god, despite, this, claim, many, fathers, saw, a, connection, between, matthew, 16, 18, and, the, primacy, of, peter, and, his, office, such, as, tertullian, writing, the, lord, said, to, peter, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, i, have, given, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, whatever, you, shall, have, bound, or, loosed, on, earth, will, be, bound, or, loosed, in, heaven, upon, you, he, says, i, will, build, my, church, and, i, will, give, to, you, the, keys, not, to, the, church, paul, s, epistle, to, the, romans, written, about, ad, 57, greets, some, fifty, people, in, rome, by, name, but, not, peter, whom, he, knew, there, is, also, no, mention, of, peter, in, rome, later, during, paul, s, two, year, stay, there, in, acts, 28, about, ad, 60, 62, some, church, historians, consider, peter, and, paul, to, have, been, martyred, under, the, reign, of, nero, around, ad, 64, or, 68, other, theologically, conservative, christians, including, confessional, lutherans, also, rebut, comments, made, by, karl, keating, and, d, a, carson, who, claim, that, there, is, no, distinction, between, the, words, petros, and, petra, in, koine, greek, the, lutheran, theologians, state, that, the, dictionaries, of, koine, nt, greek, including, the, authoritative, bauer, danker, arndt, gingrich, lexicon, indeed, list, both, words, and, the, passages, that, give, different, meanings, for, each, the, lutheran, theologians, further, note, that, we, honor, peter, and, in, fact, some, of, our, churches, are, named, after, him, but, he, was, not, the, first, pope, nor, was, he, roman, catholic, if, you, read, his, first, letter, you, will, see, that, he, did, not, teach, a, roman, hierarchy, but, that, all, christians, are, royal, priests, the, same, keys, given, to, peter, in, matthew, 16, are, given, to, the, whole, church, of, believers, in, matthew, 18, oscar, cullmann, a, lutheran, theologian, and, distinguished, church, historian, disagrees, with, luther, and, the, protestant, reformers, who, held, that, by, rock, christ, did, not, mean, peter, but, meant, either, himself, or, the, faith, of, his, followers, he, believes, the, meaning, of, the, original, aramaic, is, very, clear, that, kepha, was, the, aramaic, word, for, rock, and, that, it, was, also, the, name, by, which, christ, called, peter, yet, cullmann, sharply, rejects, the, catholic, claim, that, peter, began, the, papal, succession, he, writes, in, the, life, of, peter, there, is, no, starting, point, for, a, chain, of, succession, to, the, leadership, of, the, church, at, large, while, he, believes, the, matthew, text, is, entirely, valid, and, is, in, no, way, spurious, he, says, it, cannot, be, used, as, warrant, of, the, papal, succession, cullmann, concludes, that, while, peter, was, the, original, head, of, the, apostles, peter, was, not, the, founder, of, any, visible, church, succession, there, are, other, protestant, scholars, who, also, partially, defend, the, historical, catholic, position, about, rock, taking, a, somewhat, different, approach, from, cullman, they, point, out, that, the, gospel, of, matthew, was, not, written, in, the, classical, attic, form, of, greek, but, in, the, hellenistic, koine, dialect, in, which, there, is, no, distinction, in, meaning, between, petros, and, petra, moreover, even, in, attic, greek, in, which, the, regular, meaning, of, petros, was, a, smallish, stone, there, are, instances, of, its, use, to, refer, to, larger, rocks, as, in, sophocles, oedipus, at, colonus, v, 1595, where, petros, refers, to, a, boulder, used, as, a, landmark, obviously, something, more, than, a, pebble, in, any, case, a, petros, petra, distinction, is, irrelevant, considering, the, aramaic, language, in, which, the, phrase, might, well, have, been, spoken, in, greek, of, any, period, the, feminine, noun, petra, could, not, be, used, as, the, given, name, of, a, male, which, may, explain, the, use, of, petros, as, the, greek, word, with, which, to, translate, aramaic, kepha, yet, still, other, protestant, scholars, believe, that, jesus, in, fact, did, mean, to, single, out, peter, as, the, very, rock, which, he, will, build, upon, but, that, the, passage, does, nothing, to, indicate, a, continued, succession, of, peter, s, implied, position, they, assert, that, matthew, uses, the, demonstrative, pronoun, taute, which, allegedly, means, this, very, or, this, same, when, he, refers, to, the, rock, on, which, jesus, church, will, be, built, he, also, uses, the, greek, word, for, and, kai, it, is, alleged, that, when, a, demonstrative, pronoun, is, used, with, kai, the, pronoun, refers, back, to, the, preceding, noun, the, second, rock, jesus, refers, to, must, then, be, the, same, rock, as, the, first, one, and, if, peter, is, the, first, rock, he, must, also, be, the, second, unlike, oscar, cullmann, confessional, lutherans, and, many, other, protestant, apologists, agree, that, it, s, meaningless, to, elaborate, the, meaning, of, rock, by, looking, at, the, aramaic, language, while, the, jews, spoke, mostly, aramaic, at, home, in, public, they, usually, spoke, greek, the, few, aramaic, words, spoken, by, jesus, in, public, were, unusual, which, is, why, they, are, noted, as, such, and, most, importantly, the, new, testament, was, revealed, in, koine, greek, not, aramaic, lutheran, historians, even, report, that, the, catholic, church, itself, did, not, at, least, unanimously, regard, peter, as, the, rock, until, the, 1870s, rome, s, rule, for, explaining, the, scriptures, and, determining, doctrine, is, the, creed, of, pius, iv, this, creed, binds, rome, to, explain, the, scriptures, only, according, to, the, unanimous, consent, of, the, fathers, in, the, year, 1870, when, the, fathers, gathered, and, the, pope, declared, his, infallibility, the, cardinals, were, not, in, agreement, on, matthew, 16, 18, they, had, five, different, interpretations, seventeen, insisted, peter, is, the, rock, sixteen, held, that, christ, is, the, rock, eight, were, emphatic, that, the, whole, apostolic, college, is, the, rock, forty, four, said, peter, s, faith, is, the, rock, the, remainder, looked, upon, the, whole, body, of, believers, as, the, rock, and, yet, rome, taught, and, still, teaches, that, peter, is, the, rock, the, eastern, orthodox, church, regards, apostle, peter, together, with, apostle, paul, as, preeminent, apostles, another, title, used, for, peter, is, coryphaeus, which, could, be, translated, as, choir, director, or, lead, singer, the, church, recognises, apostle, peter, s, leadership, role, in, the, early, church, especially, in, the, very, early, days, at, jerusalem, but, does, not, consider, him, to, have, had, any, princely, role, over, his, fellow, apostles, the, new, testament, is, not, seen, by, the, orthodox, as, supporting, any, extraordinary, authority, for, peter, with, regard, to, faith, or, morals, the, orthodox, also, hold, that, peter, did, not, act, as, leader, at, the, council, of, jerusalem, but, as, merely, one, of, a, number, who, spoke, the, final, decision, regarding, the, non, necessity, of, circumcision, and, certain, prohibitions, was, spelled, out, by, james, brother, of, jesus, though, catholics, hold, james, merely, reiterated, and, fleshed, out, what, peter, had, said, regarding, the, latter, s, earlier, divine, revelation, regarding, the, inclusion, of, gentiles, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, do, not, recognise, the, bishop, of, rome, as, the, successor, of, st, peter, but, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, sends, a, delegation, each, year, to, rome, to, participate, in, the, celebration, of, the, feast, of, sts, peter, and, paul, in, the, ravenna, document, of, 13, october, 2007, the, representatives, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, agreed, that, rome, as, the, church, that, presides, in, love, according, to, the, phrase, of, st, ignatius, of, antioch, to, the, romans, prologue, occupied, the, first, place, in, the, taxis, and, that, the, bishop, of, rome, was, therefore, the, protos, among, the, patriarchs, if, the, papacy, unites, with, the, orthodox, church, they, disagree, however, on, the, interpretation, of, the, historical, evidence, from, this, era, regarding, the, prerogatives, of, the, bishop, of, rome, as, protos, a, matter, that, was, already, understood, in, different, ways, in, the, first, millennium, with, regard, to, jesus, words, to, peter, thou, art, peter, and, upon, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, the, orthodox, hold, christ, is, referring, to, the, confession, of, faith, not, the, person, of, peter, as, that, upon, which, he, will, build, the, church, this, is, allegedly, shown, by, the, fact, that, the, original, septuagint, uses, the, feminine, demonstrative, pronoun, when, he, says, upon, this, rock, whereas, grammatically, if, he, had, been, referring, to, peter, he, would, allegedly, have, used, the, masculine, the, fathers, of, the, syriac, orthodox, church, tried, to, give, a, theological, interpretation, to, the, primacy, of, apostle, peter, they, were, fully, convinced, of, the, unique, office, of, peter, in, the, primitive, christian, community, ephrem, aphrahat, and, maruthas, who, were, supposed, to, have, been, the, best, exponents, of, the, early, syriac, tradition, unequivocally, acknowledge, the, office, of, peter, the, syriac, fathers, following, the, rabbinic, tradition, call, jesus, kepha, for, they, see, rock, in, the, old, testament, as, a, messianic, symbol, yet, the, old, maronite, syriacs, of, lebanon, still, refer, to, saint, peter, as, saint, simon, the, generous, or, simon, karam, when, christ, gave, his, own, name, kepha, to, simon, he, was, giving, him, participation, in, the, person, and, office, of, christ, christ, who, is, the, kepha, and, shepherd, made, simon, the, chief, shepherd, in, his, place, and, gave, him, the, very, name, kepha, and, said, that, on, kepha, he, would, build, the, church, aphrahat, shared, the, common, syriac, tradition, for, him, kepha, is, in, fact, another, name, of, jesus, and, simon, was, given, the, right, to, share, the, name, the, person, who, receives, somebody, else, s, name, also, obtains, the, rights, of, the, person, who, bestows, the, name, aphrahat, makes, the, stone, taken, from, jordan, a, type, of, peter, he, wrote, jesus, son, of, nun, set, up, the, stones, for, a, witness, in, israel, jesus, our, saviour, called, simon, kepha, sarirto, and, set, him, as, the, faithful, witness, among, nations, again, he, wrote, in, his, commentary, on, deuteronomy, that, moses, brought, forth, water, from, rock, kepha, for, the, people, and, jesus, sent, simon, kepha, to, carry, his, teachings, among, nations, god, accepted, him, and, made, him, the, foundation, of, the, church, and, called, him, kepha, when, he, speaks, about, the, transfiguration, of, christ, he, calls, him, simon, peter, the, foundation, of, the, church, ephrem, also, shared, the, same, view, the, armenian, version, of, de, virginitate, records, that, peter, the, rock, shunned, honour, a, mimro, of, efrem, found, in, holy, week, liturgy, points, to, the, importance, of, peter, both, aphrahat, and, ephrem, represent, the, authentic, tradition, of, the, syrian, church, the, different, orders, of, liturgies, used, for, sanctification, of, church, buildings, marriage, ordination, et, cetera, reveal, that, the, primacy, of, peter, is, a, part, of, living, faith, of, the, church, the, new, apostolic, church, which, believes, in, the, re, established, apostle, ministry, sees, peter, as, the, first, chief, apostle, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, that, peter, was, the, first, leader, of, the, early, christian, church, after, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, while, the, church, accepts, apostolic, succession, from, peter, it, rejects, papal, successors, as, illegitimate, joseph, smith, the, founder, of, mormonism, recorded, in, multiple, revelations, that, the, resurrected, peter, appeared, to, him, and, oliver, cowdery, in, 1829, near, harmony, township, susquehanna, county, pennsylvania, in, order, to, bestow, the, apostleship, and, keys, of, the, kingdom, as, part, of, a, restoration, of, priesthood, authority, in, interpreting, matthew, 16, 13, 19, latter, day, saint, leader, bruce, r, mcconkie, stated, the, things, of, god, are, known, only, by, the, power, of, his, spirit, and, that, which, the, world, calls, mormonism, is, based, upon, the, rock, of, revelation, in, his, april, 1981, general, conference, address, mcconkie, identified, the, rock, of, which, jesus, spoke, as, the, rock, of, revelation, there, is, no, other, foundation, upon, which, the, lord, could, build, his, church, and, kingdom, revelation, pure, perfect, personal, revelation, this, is, the, rock, according, to, an, old, jewish, tradition, simon, peter, joined, the, early, christians, at, the, decision, of, the, rabbis, worried, that, early, christianity, s, similarity, to, judaism, would, lead, people, to, mistake, it, for, a, branch, of, judaism, he, was, chosen, to, join, them, as, he, moved, up, in, rank, he, would, be, able, to, lead, them, into, forming, their, own, distinct, belief, system, despite, this, he, was, said, to, remain, a, practicing, jew, and, is, ascribed, with, the, authorship, of, the, nishmas, prayer, muslims, consider,

peter, was, one, of, the, three, disciples, sent, to, antioch, to, preach, to, the, people, there, twelver, shia, muslims, see, a, parallel, in, the, figure, of, peter, to, ali, at, muhammad, s, time, they, look, upon, ali, as, being, the, vicegerent, with, muhammad, being, the, prophet, likewise, they, see, peter, as, the, vicegerent, behind, jesus, the, prophet, and, masih, peter, s, role, as, the, first, proper, leader, of, the, church, is, also, seen, by, shias, to, be, a, parallel, to, their, belief, in, ali, as, the, first, caliph, after, muhammad, in, the, bah, faith, the, primacy, of, peter, the, prince, of, the, apostles, is, upheld, and, defended, bah, s, understand, peter, s, station, as, the, rock, upon, which, the, church, of, god, would, be, founded, to, mean, that, peter, s, belief, in, christ, as, the, son, of, the, living, god, would, serve, as, the, foundation, for, christianity, and, that, upon, this, belief, would, the, foundation, of, the, church, of, god,

cultural, heritage, traditionally, two, canonical, epistles, 1, and, 2, peter, and, several, apocryphal, works, have, been, attributed, to, peter, the, new, testament, includes, two, letters, epistles, ascribed, to, peter, both, demonstrate, a, high, quality, of, cultured, and, urban, greek, at, odds, with, the, linguistic, skill, that, would, ordinarily, be, expected, of, an, aramaic, speaking, fisherman, who, would, have, learned, greek, as, a, second, or, third, language, the, textual, features, of, these, two, epistles, are, such, that, a, majority, of, scholars, doubt, that, they, were, written, by, the, same, hand, some, scholars, argue, that, theological, differences, imply, different, sources, and, point, to, the, lack, of, references, to, 2, peter, among, the, early, church, fathers, daniel, b, wallace, who, maintains, that, peter, was, the, author, writes, that, for, many, scholars, the, issue, of, authorship, is, already, settled, at, least, negatively, the, apostle, peter, did, not, write, this, letter, and, that, the, vast, bulk, of, nt, scholars, adopts, this, perspective, without, much, discussion, however, he, later, states, although, a, very, strong, case, has, been, made, against, petrine, authorship, of, 2, peter, we, believe, it, is, deficient, taken, together, these, external, and, internal, arguments, strongly, suggest, the, traditional, view, viz, that, peter, was, indeed, the, author, of, the, second, epistle, which, bears, his, name, of, the, two, epistles, the, first, epistle, is, considered, the, earlier, a, number, of, scholars, have, argued, that, the, textual, discrepancies, with, what, would, be, expected, of, the, biblical, peter, are, due, to, it, having, been, written, with, the, help, of, a, secretary, or, as, an, amanuensis, jerome, explains, the, two, epistles, attributed, to, st, peter, differ, in, style, character, and, the, construction, of, the, words, which, proves, that, according, to, the, exigencies, of, the, moment, st, peter, made, use, of, different, interpreters, epistle, 120, to, hedibia, some, have, seen, a, reference, to, the, use, of, a, secretary, in, the, sentence, by, silvanus, a, faithful, brother, unto, you, as, i, suppose, i, have, written, briefly, exhorting, and, testifying, that, this, is, the, true, grace, of, god, wherein, ye, stand, however, new, testament, scholar, bart, d, ehrman, in, his, 2011, book, forged, states, that, scholars, now, widely, recognise, that, when, the, author, indicates, that, he, wrote, the, book, through, silvanus, he, is, indicating, not, the, name, of, his, secretary, but, the, person, who, was, carrying, his, letter, to, the, recipients, the, letter, refers, to, roman, persecution, of, christians, apparently, of, an, official, nature, the, roman, historian, tacitus, and, the, biographer, suetonius, do, both, record, that, nero, persecuted, christians, and, tacitus, dates, this, to, immediately, after, the, fire, that, burned, rome, in, 64, christian, tradition, for, example, eusebius, of, caesarea, history, book, 2, 24, 1, has, maintained, that, peter, was, killed, in, nero, s, persecution, and, thus, had, to, assume, that, the, roman, persecution, alluded, to, in, first, peter, must, be, this, neronian, persecution, on, the, other, hand, many, modern, scholars, argue, that, first, peter, refers, to, the, persecution, of, christians, in, asia, minor, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, domitian, 81, 96, as, the, letter, is, explicitly, addressed, to, jewish, christians, from, that, region, peter, an, apostle, of, jesus, christ, to, god, s, elect, strangers, in, the, world, scattered, throughout, pontus, galatia, cappadocia, asia, and, bithynia, who, have, been, chosen, according, to, the, foreknowledge, of, god, the, father, through, the, sanctifying, work, of, the, spirit, for, obedience, to, jesus, christ, and, sprinkling, by, his, blood, grace, and, peace, be, yours, in, abundance, those, scholars, who, believe, that, the, epistle, dates, from, the, time, of, domitian, argue, that, nero, s, persecution, of, christians, was, confined, to, the, city, of, rome, itself, and, did, not, extend, to, the, asian, provinces, mentioned, in, 1, pet, 1, 1, 2, the, second, epistle, of, peter, on, the, other, hand, appears, to, have, been, copied, in, part, from, the, epistle, of, jude, and, some, modern, scholars, date, its, composition, as, late, as, c, 150, some, scholars, argue, the, opposite, that, the, epistle, of, jude, copied, second, peter, while, others, contend, an, early, date, for, jude, and, thus, observe, that, an, early, date, is, not, incompatible, with, the, text, many, scholars, have, noted, the, similarities, between, the, apocryphal, second, epistle, of, clement, 2nd, century, and, second, peter, second, peter, may, be, earlier, than, 150, there, are, a, few, possible, references, to, it, that, date, back, to, the, 1st, century, or, early, 2nd, century, e, g, 1, clement, written, in, c, ad, 96, and, the, later, church, historian, eusebius, wrote, that, origen, had, made, reference, to, the, epistle, before, 250, jerome, says, that, peter, wrote, two, epistles, which, are, called, catholic, the, second, of, which, on, account, of, its, difference, from, the, first, in, style, is, considered, by, many, not, to, be, by, him, de, viris, illustribus, 1, but, he, himself, received, the, epistle, and, explained, the, difference, in, style, character, and, structure, of, words, by, the, assumption, that, peter, used, different, interpreters, in, the, composition, of, the, two, epistles, and, from, his, time, onward, the, epistle, was, generally, regarded, as, a, part, of, the, new, testament, even, in, early, times, there, was, controversy, over, its, authorship, and, second, peter, was, often, not, included, in, the, biblical, canon, it, was, only, in, the, 4th, century, that, it, gained, a, firm, foothold, in, the, new, testament, in, a, series, of, synods, in, the, east, the, syriac, orthodox, church, still, did, not, admit, it, into, the, canon, until, the, 6th, century, traditionally, the, gospel, of, mark, was, said, to, have, been, written, by, a, person, named, john, mark, and, that, this, person, was, an, assistant, to, peter, hence, its, content, was, traditionally, seen, as, the, closest, to, peter, s, viewpoint, according, to, eusebius, ecclesiastical, history, papias, recorded, this, belief, from, john, the, presbyter, mark, having, become, the, interpreter, of, peter, wrote, down, accurately, whatsoever, he, remembered, it, was, not, however, in, exact, order, that, he, related, the, sayings, or, deeds, of, christ, for, he, neither, heard, the, lord, nor, accompanied, him, but, afterwards, as, i, said, he, accompanied, peter, who, accommodated, his, instructions, to, the, necessities, but, with, no, intention, of, giving, a, normal, or, chronological, narrative, of, the, lord, s, sayings, wherefore, mark, made, no, mistake, in, thus, writing, some, things, as, he, remembered, them, for, of, one, thing, he, took, especial, care, not, to, omit, anything, he, had, heard, and, not, to, put, anything, fictional, into, the, statements, clement, of, alexandria, in, the, fragments, of, his, work, hypotyposes, a, d, 190, preserved, and, cited, by, the, historian, eusebius, in, his, church, history, vi, 14, 6, writes, that, as, peter, had, preached, the, word, publicly, at, rome, and, declared, the, gospel, by, the, spirit, many, who, were, present, requested, that, mark, who, had, followed, him, for, a, long, time, and, remembered, his, sayings, should, write, them, out, and, having, composed, the, gospel, he, gave, it, to, those, who, had, requested, it, also, irenaeus, wrote, about, this, tradition, after, their, peter, and, paul, s, passing, mark, also, the, disciple, and, interpreter, of, peter, transmitted, to, us, in, writing, the, things, preached, by, peter, based, on, these, quotes, and, on, the, christian, tradition, the, information, in, mark, s, gospel, about, peter, would, be, based, on, eyewitness, material, the, gospel, itself, is, anonymous, and, the, above, passages, are, the, oldest, surviving, written, testimony, to, its, authorship, there, are, also, a, number, of, other, apocryphal, writings, which, have, been, either, attributed, to, or, written, about, peter, these, include, two, sayings, are, attributed, to, peter, in, the, gnostic, gospel, of, thomas, in, the, first, peter, compares, jesus, to, a, just, messenger, in, the, second, peter, asks, jesus, to, make, mary, leave, us, for, females, don, t, deserve, life, in, the, apocalypse, of, peter, peter, holds, a, dialogue, with, jesus, about, the, parable, of, the, fig, tree, and, the, fate, of, sinners, in, the, gospel, of, mary, whose, text, is, largely, fragmented, peter, appears, to, be, jealous, of, mary, probably, mary, magdalene, he, says, to, the, other, disciples, did, he, really, speak, privately, with, a, woman, and, not, openly, to, us, are, we, to, turn, about, and, all, listen, to, her, did, he, prefer, her, to, us, in, reply, to, this, levi, says, peter, you, have, always, been, hot, tempered, other, noncanonical, texts, that, attribute, sayings, to, peter, include, the, secret, book, of, james, and, the, acts, of, peter, in, the, fayyum, fragment, which, dates, to, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, jesus, predicts, that, peter, will, deny, him, three, times, before, a, cock, crows, on, the, following, morning, the, account, is, similar, to, that, of, the, canonical, gospels, especially, the, gospel, of, mark, it, is, unclear, whether, the, fragment, is, an, abridged, version, of, the, accounts, in, the, synoptic, gospels, or, a, source, text, on, which, they, were, based, perhaps, the, apocryphal, gospel, of, peter, the, fragmentary, gospel, of, peter, contains, an, account, of, the, death, of, jesus, differing, significantly, from, the, canonical, gospels, it, contains, little, information, about, peter, himself, except, that, after, the, discovery, of, the, empty, tomb, i, simon, peter, and, andrew, my, brother, took, our, fishing, nets, and, went, to, the, sea, the, earliest, portrait, of, peter, dates, back, to, the, 4th, century, and, was, located, in, 2010, in, traditional, iconography, peter, has, been, shown, very, consistently, since, early, christian, art, as, an, oldish, thick, set, man, with, a, slightly, combative, face, and, a, short, beard, and, usually, white, hair, sometimes, balding, he, thus, contrasts, with, paul, the, apostle, who, is, bald, except, at, the, sides, with, a, longer, beard, and, often, black, hair, and, thinner, in, the, face, one, exception, to, this, is, in, anglo, saxon, art, where, he, typically, lacks, a, beard, both, peter, and, paul, are, shown, thus, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, catacombs, of, marcellinus, and, peter, in, rome, later, in, the, middle, ages, his, attribute, is, one, or, two, large, keys, in, his, hand, or, hanging, from, his, belt, first, seen, in, the, early, 8th, century, more, than, many, medieval, attributes, this, continued, to, be, depicted, in, the, renaissance, and, afterwards, by, the, 15th, century, peter, is, more, likely, to, be, bald, on, the, top, of, his, head, in, the, western, church, but, he, continues, to, have, a, good, head, of, hair, in, orthodox, icons, the, depiction, of, saint, peter, as, literally, the, keeper, of, the, gates, of, heaven, popular, with, modern, cartoonists, is, not, found, in, traditional, religious, art, but, peter, usually, heads, groups, of, saints, flanking, god, in, heaven, on, the, right, side, viewer, s, left, of, god, narrative, images, of, peter, include, several, scenes, from, the, life, of, christ, where, he, is, mentioned, in, the, gospels, and, he, is, often, identifiable, in, scenes, where, his, presence, is, not, specifically, mentioned, usually, he, stands, nearest, to, christ, in, particular, depictions, of, the, arrest, of, christ, usually, include, peter, cutting, off, the, ear, of, one, of, the, soldiers, scenes, without, jesus, include, his, distinctive, martyrdom, his, rescue, from, prison, and, sometimes, his, trial, in, the, counter, reformation, scenes, of, peter, hearing, the, cock, crow, for, the, third, time, became, popular, as, a, representation, of, repentance, and, hence, the, catholic, sacrament, of, confession, or, reconciliation, l, michael, white, suggests, that, there, was, a, serious, division, between, peter, s, jewish, christian, party, and, paul, s, hellenizing, party, seen, in, e, g, the, incident, at, antioch, which, later, christian, accounts, have, downplayed, another, revisionist, view, was, developed, by, supporters, of, the, christ, myth, theory, which, holds, that, the, figure, of, peter, is, largely, a, development, from, some, mythological, doorkeeper, figures, according, to, arthur, drews, and, g, a, wells, if, there, was, a, historical, peter, then, all, that, is, known, about, him, is, the, brief, mentions, in, galatians
