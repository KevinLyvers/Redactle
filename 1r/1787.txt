georg, ferdinand, ludwig, philipp, cantor, k, n, t, r, kan, tor, german, 3, march, 1845, 6, january, 1918, was, a, mathematician, who, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, creation, of, set, theory, which, has, become, a, fundamental, theory, in, mathematics, cantor, established, the, importance, of, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, members, of, two, sets, defined, infinite, and, well, ordered, sets, and, proved, that, the, real, numbers, are, more, numerous, than, the, natural, numbers, cantor, s, method, of, proof, of, this, theorem, implies, the, existence, of, an, infinity, of, infinities, he, defined, the, cardinal, and, ordinal, numbers, and, their, arithmetic, cantor, s, work, is, of, great, philosophical, interest, a, fact, he, was, well, aware, of, originally, cantor, s, theory, of, transfinite, numbers, was, regarded, as, counter, intuitive, even, shocking, this, caused, it, to, encounter, resistance, from, mathematical, contemporaries, such, as, leopold, kronecker, and, henri, poincar, and, later, from, hermann, weyl, and, l, e, j, brouwer, while, ludwig, wittgenstein, raised, philosophical, objections, see, controversy, over, cantor, s, theory, cantor, a, devout, lutheran, christian, believed, the, theory, had, been, communicated, to, him, by, god, some, christian, theologians, particularly, neo, scholastics, saw, cantor, s, work, as, a, challenge, to, the, uniqueness, of, the, absolute, infinity, in, the, nature, of, god, on, one, occasion, equating, the, theory, of, transfinite, numbers, with, pantheism, a, proposition, that, cantor, vigorously, rejected, not, all, theologians, were, against, cantor, s, theory, prominent, neo, scholastic, philosopher, constantin, gutberlet, was, in, favor, of, it, and, cardinal, johann, baptist, franzelin, accepted, it, as, a, valid, theory, after, cantor, made, some, important, clarifications, the, objections, to, cantor, s, work, were, occasionally, fierce, leopold, kronecker, s, public, opposition, and, personal, attacks, included, describing, cantor, as, a, scientific, charlatan, a, renegade, and, a, corrupter, of, youth, kronecker, objected, to, cantor, s, proofs, that, the, algebraic, numbers, are, countable, and, that, the, transcendental, numbers, are, uncountable, results, now, included, in, a, standard, mathematics, curriculum, writing, decades, after, cantor, s, death, wittgenstein, lamented, that, mathematics, is, ridden, through, and, through, with, the, pernicious, idioms, of, set, theory, which, he, dismissed, as, utter, nonsense, that, is, laughable, and, wrong, cantor, s, recurring, bouts, of, depression, from, 1884, to, the, end, of, his, life, have, been, blamed, on, the, hostile, attitude, of, many, of, his, contemporaries, though, some, have, explained, these, episodes, as, probable, manifestations, of, a, bipolar, disorder, the, harsh, criticism, has, been, matched, by, later, accolades, in, 1904, the, royal, society, awarded, cantor, its, sylvester, medal, the, highest, honor, it, can, confer, for, work, in, mathematics, david, hilbert, defended, it, from, its, critics, by, declaring, no, one, shall, expel, us, from, the, paradise, that, cantor, has, created, georg, cantor, born, in, 1845, in, saint, petersburg, russian, empire, was, brought, up, in, that, city, until, the, age, of, eleven, the, oldest, of, six, children, he, was, regarded, as, an, outstanding, violinist, his, grandfather, franz, b, hm, 1788, 1846, the, violinist, joseph, b, hm, s, brother, was, a, well, known, musician, and, soloist, in, a, russian, imperial, orchestra, cantor, s, father, had, been, a, member, of, the, saint, petersburg, stock, exchange, when, he, became, ill, the, family, moved, to, germany, in, 1856, first, to, wiesbaden, then, to, frankfurt, seeking, milder, winters, than, those, of, saint, petersburg, in, 1860, cantor, graduated, with, distinction, from, the, realschule, in, darmstadt, his, exceptional, skills, in, mathematics, trigonometry, in, particular, were, noted, in, august, 1862, he, then, graduated, from, the, h, here, gewerbeschule, darmstadt, now, the, technische, universit, t, darmstadt, in, 1862, cantor, entered, the, swiss, federal, polytechnic, in, zurich, after, receiving, a, substantial, inheritance, upon, his, father, s, death, in, june, 1863, cantor, transferred, to, the, university, of, berlin, attending, lectures, by, leopold, kronecker, karl, weierstrass, and, ernst, kummer, he, spent, the, summer, of, 1866, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, then, and, later, a, center, for, mathematical, research, cantor, was, a, good, student, and, he, received, his, doctoral, degree, in, 1867, cantor, submitted, his, dissertation, on, number, theory, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1867, after, teaching, briefly, in, a, berlin, girls, school, he, took, up, a, position, at, the, university, of, halle, where, he, spent, his, entire, career, he, was, awarded, the, requisite, habilitation, for, his, thesis, also, on, number, theory, which, he, presented, in, 1869, upon, his, appointment, at, halle, university, in, 1874, cantor, married, vally, guttmann, they, had, six, children, the, last, rudolph, born, in, 1886, cantor, was, able, to, support, a, family, despite, his, modest, academic, pay, thanks, to, his, inheritance, from, his, father, during, his, honeymoon, in, the, harz, mountains, cantor, spent, much, time, in, mathematical, discussions, with, richard, dedekind, whom, he, had, met, at, interlaken, in, switzerland, two, years, earlier, while, on, holiday, cantor, was, promoted, to, extraordinary, professor, in, 1872, and, made, full, professor, in, 1879, to, attain, the, latter, rank, at, the, age, of, 34, was, a, notable, accomplishment, but, cantor, desired, a, chair, at, a, more, prestigious, university, in, particular, at, berlin, at, that, time, the, leading, german, university, however, his, work, encountered, too, much, opposition, for, that, to, be, possible, kronecker, who, headed, mathematics, at, berlin, until, his, death, in, 1891, became, increasingly, uncomfortable, with, the, prospect, of, having, cantor, as, a, colleague, perceiving, him, as, a, corrupter, of, youth, for, teaching, his, ideas, to, a, younger, generation, of, mathematicians, worse, yet, kronecker, a, well, established, figure, within, the, mathematical, community, and, cantor, s, former, professor, disagreed, fundamentally, with, the, thrust, of, cantor, s, work, ever, since, he, had, intentionally, delayed, the, publication, of, cantor, s, first, major, publication, in, 1874, kronecker, now, seen, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, constructive, viewpoint, in, mathematics, disliked, much, of, cantor, s, set, theory, because, it, asserted, the, existence, of, sets, satisfying, certain, properties, without, giving, specific, examples, of, sets, whose, members, did, indeed, satisfy, those, properties, whenever, cantor, applied, for, a, post, in, berlin, he, was, declined, and, the, process, usually, involved, kronecker, so, cantor, came, to, believe, that, kronecker, s, stance, would, make, it, impossible, for, him, ever, to, leave, halle, in, 1881, cantor, s, halle, colleague, eduard, heine, died, halle, accepted, cantor, s, suggestion, that, heine, s, vacant, chair, be, offered, to, dedekind, heinrich, m, weber, and, franz, mertens, in, that, order, but, each, declined, the, chair, after, being, offered, it, friedrich, wangerin, was, eventually, appointed, but, he, was, never, close, to, cantor, in, 1882, the, mathematical, correspondence, between, cantor, and, dedekind, came, to, an, end, apparently, as, a, result, of, dedekind, s, declining, the, chair, at, halle, cantor, also, began, another, important, correspondence, with, g, sta, mittag, leffler, in, sweden, and, soon, began, to, publish, in, mittag, leffler, s, journal, acta, mathematica, but, in, 1885, mittag, leffler, was, concerned, about, the, philosophical, nature, and, new, terminology, in, a, paper, cantor, had, submitted, to, acta, he, asked, cantor, to, withdraw, the, paper, from, acta, while, it, was, in, proof, writing, that, it, was, about, one, hundred, years, too, soon, cantor, complied, but, then, curtailed, his, relationship, and, correspondence, with, mittag, leffler, writing, to, a, third, party, had, mittag, leffler, had, his, way, i, should, have, to, wait, until, the, year, 1984, which, to, me, seemed, too, great, a, demand, but, of, course, i, never, want, to, know, anything, again, about, acta, mathematica, cantor, suffered, his, first, known, bout, of, depression, in, may, 1884, criticism, of, his, work, weighed, on, his, mind, every, one, of, the, fifty, two, letters, he, wrote, to, mittag, leffler, in, 1884, mentioned, kronecker, a, passage, from, one, of, these, letters, is, revealing, of, the, damage, to, cantor, s, self, confidence, i, don, t, know, when, i, shall, return, to, the, continuation, of, my, scientific, work, at, the, moment, i, can, do, absolutely, nothing, with, it, and, limit, myself, to, the, most, necessary, duty, of, my, lectures, how, much, happier, i, would, be, to, be, scientifically, active, if, only, i, had, the, necessary, mental, freshness, this, crisis, led, him, to, apply, to, lecture, on, philosophy, rather, than, on, mathematics, he, also, began, an, intense, study, of, elizabethan, literature, thinking, there, might, be, evidence, that, francis, bacon, wrote, the, plays, attributed, to, william, shakespeare, see, shakespearean, authorship, question, this, ultimately, resulted, in, two, pamphlets, published, in, 1896, and, 1897, cantor, recovered, soon, thereafter, and, subsequently, made, further, important, contributions, including, his, diagonal, argument, and, theorem, however, he, never, again, attained, the, high, level, of, his, remarkable, papers, of, 1874, 84, even, after, kronecker, s, death, on, december, 29, 1891, he, eventually, sought, and, achieved, a, reconciliation, with, kronecker, nevertheless, the, philosophical, disagreements, and, difficulties, dividing, them, persisted, in, 1889, cantor, was, instrumental, in, founding, the, german, mathematical, society, and, he, chaired, its, first, meeting, in, halle, in, 1891, where, he, first, introduced, his, diagonal, argument, his, reputation, was, strong, enough, despite, kronecker, s, opposition, to, his, work, to, ensure, he, was, elected, as, the, first, president, of, this, society, setting, aside, the, animosity, kronecker, had, displayed, towards, him, cantor, invited, him, to, address, the, meeting, but, kronecker, was, unable, to, do, so, because, his, wife, was, dying, from, injuries, sustained, in, a, skiing, accident, at, the, time, georg, cantor, was, also, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, first, international, congress, of, mathematicians, which, took, place, in, z, rich, switzerland, in, 1897, after, cantor, s, 1884, hospitalization, there, is, no, record, that, he, was, in, any, sanatorium, again, until, 1899, soon, after, that, second, hospitalization, cantor, s, youngest, son, rudolph, died, suddenly, on, december, 16, cantor, was, delivering, a, lecture, on, his, views, on, baconian, theory, and, william, shakespeare, and, this, tragedy, drained, cantor, of, much, of, his, passion, for, mathematics, cantor, was, again, hospitalized, in, 1903, one, year, later, he, was, outraged, and, agitated, by, a, paper, presented, by, julius, k, nig, at, the, third, international, congress, of, mathematicians, the, paper, attempted, to, prove, that, the, basic, tenets, of, transfinite, set, theory, were, false, since, the, paper, had, been, read, in, front, of, his, daughters, and, colleagues, cantor, perceived, himself, as, having, been, publicly, humiliated, although, ernst, zermelo, demonstrated, less, than, a, day, later, that, k, nig, s, proof, had, failed, cantor, remained, shaken, and, momentarily, questioning, god, cantor, suffered, from, chronic, depression, for, the, rest, of, his, life, for, which, he, was, excused, from, teaching, on, several, occasions, and, repeatedly, confined, to, various, sanatoria, the, events, of, 1904, preceded, a, series, of, hospitalizations, at, intervals, of, two, or, three, years, he, did, not, abandon, mathematics, completely, however, lecturing, on, the, paradoxes, of, set, theory, burali, forti, paradox, cantor, s, paradox, and, russell, s, paradox, to, a, meeting, of, the, deutsche, mathematiker, vereinigung, in, 1903, and, attending, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, at, heidelberg, in, 1904, in, 1911, cantor, was, one, of, the, distinguished, foreign, scholars, invited, to, the, 500th, anniversary, of, the, founding, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, scotland, cantor, attended, hoping, to, meet, bertrand, russell, whose, newly, published, principia, mathematica, repeatedly, cited, cantor, s, work, but, the, encounter, did, not, come, about, the, following, year, st, andrews, awarded, cantor, an, honorary, doctorate, but, illness, precluded, his, receiving, the, degree, in, person, cantor, retired, in, 1913, and, lived, in, poverty, and, suffered, from, malnourishment, during, world, war, i, the, public, celebration, of, his, 70th, birthday, was, canceled, because, of, the, war, in, june, 1917, he, entered, a, sanatorium, for, the, last, time, and, continually, wrote, to, his, wife, asking, to, be, allowed, to, go, home, georg, cantor, had, a, fatal, heart, attack, on, january, 6, 1918, in, the, sanatorium, where, he, had, spent, the, last, year, of, his, life, cantor, s, work, between, 1874, and, 1884, is, the, origin, of, set, theory, prior, to, this, work, the, concept, of, a, set, was, a, rather, elementary, one, that, had, been, used, implicitly, since, the, beginning, of, mathematics, dating, back, to, the, ideas, of, aristotle, no, one, had, realized, that, set, theory, had, any, nontrivial, content, before, cantor, there, were, only, finite, sets, which, are, easy, to, understand, and, the, infinite, which, was, considered, a, topic, for, philosophical, rather, than, mathematical, discussion, by, proving, that, there, are, infinitely, many, possible, sizes, for, infinite, sets, cantor, established, that, set, theory, was, not, trivial, and, it, needed, to, be, studied, set, theory, has, come, to, play, the, role, of, a, foundational, theory, in, modern, mathematics, in, the, sense, that, it, interprets, propositions, about, mathematical, objects, for, example, numbers, and, functions, from, all, the, traditional, areas, of, mathematics, such, as, algebra, analysis, and, topology, in, a, single, theory, and, provides, a, standard, set, of, axioms, to, prove, or, disprove, them, the, basic, concepts, of, set, theory, are, now, used, throughout, mathematics, in, one, of, his, earliest, papers, cantor, proved, that, the, set, of, real, numbers, is, more, numerous, than, the, set, of, natural, numbers, this, showed, for, the, first, time, that, there, exist, infinite, sets, of, different, sizes, he, was, also, the, first, to, appreciate, the, importance, of, one, to, one, correspondences, hereinafter, denoted, 1, to, 1, correspondence, in, set, theory, he, used, this, concept, to, define, finite, and, infinite, sets, subdividing, the, latter, into, denumerable, or, countably, infinite, sets, and, nondenumerable, sets, uncountably, infinite, sets, cantor, developed, important, concepts, in, topology, and, their, relation, to, cardinality, for, example, he, showed, that, the, cantor, set, discovered, by, henry, john, stephen, smith, in, 1875, is, nowhere, dense, but, has, the, same, cardinality, as, the, set, of, all, real, numbers, whereas, the, rationals, are, everywhere, dense, but, countable, he, also, showed, that, all, countable, dense, linear, orders, without, end, points, are, order, isomorphic, to, the, rational, numbers, cantor, introduced, fundamental, constructions, in, set, theory, such, as, the, power, set, of, a, set, a, which, is, the, set, of, all, possible, subsets, of, a, he, later, proved, that, the, size, of, the, power, set, of, a, is, strictly, larger, than, the, size, of, a, even, when, a, is, an, infinite, set, this, result, soon, became, known, as, cantor, s, theorem, cantor, developed, an, entire, theory, and, arithmetic, of, infinite, sets, called, cardinals, and, ordinals, which, extended, the, arithmetic, of, the, natural, numbers, his, notation, for, the, cardinal, numbers, was, the, hebrew, letter, displaystyle, aleph, aleph, with, a, natural, number, subscript, for, the, ordinals, he, employed, the, greek, letter, displaystyle, omega, omega, this, notation, is, still, in, use, today, the, continuum, hypothesis, introduced, by, cantor, was, presented, by, david, hilbert, as, the, first, of, his, twenty, three, open, problems, in, his, address, at, the, 1900, international, congress, of, mathematicians, in, paris, cantor, s, work, also, attracted, favorable, notice, beyond, hilbert, s, celebrated, encomium, the, us, philosopher, charles, sanders, peirce, praised, cantor, s, set, theory, and, following, public, lectures, delivered, by, cantor, at, the, first, international, congress, of, mathematicians, held, in, z, rich, in, 1897, adolf, hurwitz, and, jacques, hadamard, also, both, expressed, their, admiration, at, that, congress, cantor, renewed, his, friendship, and, correspondence, with, dedekind, from, 1905, cantor, corresponded, with, his, british, admirer, and, translator, philip, jourdain, on, the, history, of, set, theory, and, on, cantor, s, religious, ideas, this, was, later, published, as, were, several, of, his, expository, works, cantor, s, first, ten, papers, were, on, number, theory, his, thesis, topic, at, the, suggestion, of, eduard, heine, the, professor, at, halle, cantor, turned, to, analysis, heine, proposed, that, cantor, solve, an, open, problem, that, had, eluded, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, rudolf, lipschitz, bernhard, riemann, and, heine, himself, the, uniqueness, of, the, representation, of, a, function, by, trigonometric, series, cantor, solved, this, problem, in, 1869, it, was, while, working, on, this, problem, that, he, discovered, transfinite, ordinals, which, occurred, as, indices, n, in, the, n, th, derived, set, s, n, of, a, set, s, of, zeros, of, a, trigonometric, series, given, a, trigonometric, series, f, x, with, s, as, its, set, of, zeros, cantor, had, discovered, a, procedure, that, produced, another, trigonometric, series, that, had, s, 1, as, its, set, of, zeros, where, s, 1, is, the, set, of, limit, points, of, s, if, s, k, 1, is, the, set, of, limit, points, of, s, k, then, he, could, construct, a, trigonometric, series, whose, zeros, are, s, k, 1, because, the, sets, s, k, were, closed, they, contained, their, limit, points, and, the, intersection, of, the, infinite, decreasing, sequence, of, sets, s, s, 1, s, 2, s, 3, formed, a, limit, set, which, we, would, now, call, s, and, then, he, noticed, that, s, would, also, have, to, have, a, set, of, limit, points, s, 1, and, so, on, he, had, examples, that, went, on, forever, and, so, here, was, a, naturally, occurring, infinite, sequence, of, infinite, numbers, 1, 2, between, 1870, and, 1872, cantor, published, more, papers, on, trigonometric, series, and, also, a, paper, defining, irrational, numbers, as, convergent, sequences, of, rational, numbers, dedekind, whom, cantor, befriended, in, 1872, cited, this, paper, later, that, year, in, the, paper, where, he, first, set, out, his, celebrated, definition, of, real, numbers, by, dedekind, cuts, while, extending, the, notion, of, number, by, means, of, his, revolutionary, concept, of, infinite, cardinality, cantor, was, paradoxically, opposed, to, theories, of, infinitesimals, of, his, contemporaries, otto, stolz, and, paul, du, bois, reymond, describing, them, as, both, an, abomination, and, a, cholera, bacillus, of, mathematics, cantor, also, published, an, erroneous, proof, of, the, inconsistency, of, infinitesimals, the, beginning, of, set, theory, as, a, branch, of, mathematics, is, often, marked, by, the, publication, of, cantor, s, 1874, paper, ueber, eine, eigenschaft, des, inbegriffes, aller, reellen, algebraischen, zahlen, on, a, property, of, the, collection, of, all, real, algebraic, numbers, this, paper, was, the, first, to, provide, a, rigorous, proof, that, there, was, more, than, one, kind, of, infinity, previously, all, infinite, collections, had, been, implicitly, assumed, to, be, equinumerous, that, is, of, the, same, size, or, having, the, same, number, of, elements, cantor, proved, that, the, collection, of, real, numbers, and, the, collection, of, positive, integers, are, not, equinumerous, in, other, words, the, real, numbers, are, not, countable, his, proof, differs, from, the, diagonal, argument, that, he, gave, in, 1891, cantor, s, article, also, contains, a, new, method, of, constructing, transcendental, numbers, transcendental, numbers, were, first, constructed, by, joseph, liouville, in, 1844, cantor, established, these, results, using, two, constructions, his, first, construction, shows, how, to, write, the, real, algebraic, numbers, as, a, sequence, a, 1, a, 2, a, 3, in, other, words, the, real, algebraic, numbers, are, countable, cantor, starts, his, second, construction, with, any, sequence, of, real, numbers, using, this, sequence, he, constructs, nested, intervals, whose, intersection, contains, a, real, number, not, in, the, sequence, since, every, sequence, of, real, numbers, can, be, used, to, construct, a, real, not, in, the, sequence, the, real, numbers, cannot, be, written, as, a, sequence, that, is, the, real, numbers, are, not, countable, by, applying, his, construction, to, the, sequence, of, real, algebraic, numbers, cantor, produces, a, transcendental, number, cantor, points, out, that, his, constructions, prove, more, namely, they, provide, a, new, proof, of, liouville, s, theorem, every, interval, contains, infinitely, many, transcendental, numbers, cantor, s, next, article, contains, a, construction, that, proves, the, set, of, transcendental, numbers, has, the, same, power, see, below, as, the, set, of, real, numbers, between, 1879, and, 1884, cantor, published, a, series, of, six, articles, in, mathematische, annalen, that, together, formed, an, introduction, to, his, set, theory, at, the, same, time, there, was, growing, opposition, to, cantor, s, ideas, led, by, leopold, kronecker, who, admitted, mathematical, concepts, only, if, they, could, be, constructed, in, a, finite, number, of, steps, from, the, natural, numbers, which, he, took, as, intuitively, given, for, kronecker, cantor, s, hierarchy, of, infinities, was, inadmissible, since, accepting, the, concept, of, actual, infinity, would, open, the, door, to, paradoxes, which, would, challenge, the, validity, of, mathematics, as, a, whole, cantor, also, introduced, the, cantor, set, during, this, period, the, fifth, paper, in, this, series, grundlagen, einer, allgemeinen, mannigfaltigkeitslehre, foundations, of, a, general, theory, of, aggregates, published, in, 1883, was, the, most, important, of, the, six, and, was, also, published, as, a, separate, monograph, it, contained, cantor, s, reply, to, his, critics, and, showed, how, the, transfinite, numbers, were, a, systematic, extension, of, the, natural, numbers, it, begins, by, defining, well, ordered, sets, ordinal, numbers, are, then, introduced, as, the, order, types, of, well, ordered, sets, cantor, then, defines, the, addition, and, multiplication, of, the, cardinal, and, ordinal, numbers, in, 1885, cantor, extended, his, theory, of, order, types, so, that, the, ordinal, numbers, simply, became, a, special, case, of, order, types, in, 1891, he, published, a, paper, containing, his, elegant, diagonal, argument, for, the, existence, of, an, uncountable, set, he, applied, the, same, idea, to, prove, cantor, s, theorem, the, cardinality, of, the, power, set, of, a, set, a, is, strictly, larger, than, the, cardinality, of, a, this, established, the, richness, of, the, hierarchy, of, infinite, sets, and, of, the, cardinal, and, ordinal, arithmetic, that, cantor, had, defined, his, argument, is, fundamental, in, the, solution, of, the, halting, problem, and, the, proof, of, g, del, s, first, incompleteness, theorem, cantor, wrote, on, the, goldbach, conjecture, in, 1894, in, 1895, and, 1897, cantor, published, a, two, part, paper, in, mathematische, annalen, under, felix, klein, s, editorship, these, were, his, last, significant, papers, on, set, theory, the, first, paper, begins, by, defining, set, subset, etc, in, ways, that, would, be, largely, acceptable, now, the, cardinal, and, ordinal, arithmetic, are, reviewed, cantor, wanted, the, second, paper, to, include, a, proof, of, the, continuum, hypothesis, but, had, to, settle, for, expositing, his, theory, of, well, ordered, sets, and, ordinal, numbers, cantor, attempts, to, prove, that, if, a, and, b, are, sets, with, a, equivalent, to, a, subset, of, b, and, b, equivalent, to, a, subset, of, a, then, a, and, b, are, equivalent, ernst, schr, der, had, stated, this, theorem, a, bit, earlier, but, his, proof, as, well, as, cantor, s, was, flawed, felix, bernstein, supplied, a, correct, proof, in, his, 1898, phd, thesis, hence, the, name, cantor, bernstein, schr, der, theorem, cantor, s, 1874, crelle, paper, was, the, first, to, invoke, the, notion, of, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, though, he, did, not, use, that, phrase, he, then, began, looking, for, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, between, the, points, of, the, unit, square, and, the, points, of, a, unit, line, segment, in, an, 1877, letter, to, richard, dedekind, cantor, proved, a, far, stronger, result, for, any, positive, integer, n, there, exists, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, between, the, points, on, the, unit, line, segment, and, all, of, the, points, in, an, n, dimensional, space, about, this, discovery, cantor, wrote, to, dedekind, je, le, vois, mais, je, ne, le, crois, pas, i, see, it, but, i, don, t, believe, it, the, result, that, he, found, so, astonishing, has, implications, for, geometry, and, the, notion, of, dimension, in, 1878, cantor, submitted, another, paper, to, crelle, s, journal, in, which, he, defined, precisely, the, concept, of, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, and, introduced, the, notion, of, power, a, term, he, took, from, jakob, steiner, or, equivalence, of, sets, two, sets, are, equivalent, have, the, same, power, if, there, exists, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, between, them, cantor, defined, countable, sets, or, denumerable, sets, as, sets, which, can, be, put, into, a, 1, to, 1, correspondence, with, the, natural, numbers, and, proved, that, the, rational, numbers, are, denumerable, he, also, proved, that, n, dimensional, euclidean, space, r, n, has, the, same, power, as, the, real, numbers, r, as, does, a, countably, infinite, product, of, copies, of, r, while, he, made, free, use, of, countability, as, a, concept, he, did, not, write, the, word, countable, until, 1883, cantor, also, discussed, his, thinking, about, dimension, stressing, that, his, mapping, between, the, unit, interval, and, the, unit, square, was, not, a, continuous, one, this, paper, displeased, kronecker, and, cantor, wanted, to, withdraw, it, however, dedekind, persuaded, him, not, to, do, so, and, karl, weierstrass, supported, its, publication, nevertheless, cantor, never, again, submitted, anything, to, crelle, cantor, was, the, first, to, formulate, what, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, continuum, hypothesis, or, ch, there, exists, no, set, whose, power, is, greater, than, that, of, the, naturals, and, less, than, that, of, the, reals, or, equivalently, the, cardinality, of, the, reals, is, exactly, aleph, one, rather, than, just, at, least, aleph, one, cantor, believed, the, continuum, hypothesis, to, be, true, and, tried, for, many, years, to, prove, it, in, vain, his, inability, to, prove, the, continuum, hypothesis, caused, him, considerable, anxiety, the, difficulty, cantor, had, in, proving, the, continuum, hypothesis, has, been, underscored, by, later, developments, in, the, field, of, mathematics, a, 1940, result, by, kurt, g, del, and, a, 1963, one, by, paul, cohen, together, imply, that, the, continuum, hypothesis, can, be, neither, proved, nor, disproved, using, standard, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, plus, the, axiom, of, choice, the, combination, referred, to, as, zfc, in, 1883, cantor, divided, the, infinite, into, the, transfinite, and, the, absolute, the, transfinite, is, increasable, in, magnitude, while, the, absolute, is, unincreasable, for, example, an, ordinal, is, transfinite, because, it, can, be, increased, to, 1, on, the, other, hand, the, ordinals, form, an, absolutely, infinite, sequence, that, cannot, be, increased, in, magnitude, because, there, are, no, larger, ordinals, to, add, to, it, in, 1883, cantor, also, introduced, the, well, ordering, principle, every, set, can, be, well, ordered, and, stated, that, it, is, a, law, of, thought, cantor, extended, his, work, on, the, absolute, infinite, by, using, it, in, a, proof, around, 1895, he, began, to, regard, his, well, ordering, principle, as, a, theorem, and, attempted, to, prove, it, in, 1899, he, sent, dedekind, a, proof, of, the, equivalent, aleph, theorem, the, cardinality, of, every, infinite, set, is, an, aleph, first, he, defined, two, types, of, multiplicities, consistent, multiplicities, sets, and, inconsistent, multiplicities, absolutely, infinite, multiplicities, next, he, assumed, that, the, ordinals, form, a, set, proved, that, this, leads, to, a, contradiction, and, concluded, that, the, ordinals, form, an, inconsistent, multiplicity, he, used, this, inconsistent, multiplicity, to, prove, the, aleph, theorem, in, 1932, zermelo, criticized, the, construction, in, cantor, s, proof, cantor, avoided, paradoxes, by, recognizing, that, there, are, two, types, of, multiplicities, in, his, set, theory, when, it, is, assumed, that, the, ordinals, form, a, set, the, resulting, contradiction, implies, only, that, the, ordinals, form, an, inconsistent, multiplicity, in, contrast, bertrand, russell, treated, all, collections, as, sets, which, leads, to, paradoxes, in, russell, s, set, theory, the, ordinals, form, a, set, so, the, resulting, contradiction, implies, that, the, theory, is, inconsistent, from, 1901, to, 1903, russell, discovered, three, paradoxes, implying, that, his, set, theory, is, inconsistent, the, burali, forti, paradox, which, was, just, mentioned, cantor, s, paradox, and, russell, s, paradox, russell, named, paradoxes, after, cesare, burali, forti, and, cantor, even, though, neither, of, them, believed, that, they, had, found, paradoxes, in, 1908, zermelo, published, his, axiom, system, for, set, theory, he, had, two, motivations, for, developing, the, axiom, system, eliminating, the, paradoxes, and, securing, his, proof, of, the, well, ordering, theorem, zermelo, had, proved, this, theorem, in, 1904, using, the, axiom, of, choice, but, his, proof, was, criticized, for, a, variety, of, reasons, his, response, to, the, criticism, included, his, axiom, system, and, a, new, proof, of, the, well, ordering, theorem, his, axioms, support, this, new, proof, and, they, eliminate, the, paradoxes, by, restricting, the, formation, of, sets, in, 1923, john, von, neumann, developed, an, axiom, system, that, eliminates, the, paradoxes, by, using, an, approach, similar, to, cantor, s, namely, by, identifying, collections, that, are, not, sets, and, treating, them, differently, von, neumann, stated, that, a, class, is, too, big, to, be, a, set, if, it, can, be, put, into, one, to, one, correspondence, with, the, class, of, all, sets, he, defined, a, set, as, a, class, that, is, a, member, of, some, class, and, stated, the, axiom, a, class, is, not, a, set, if, and, only, if, there, is, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, it, and, the, class, of, all, sets, this, axiom, implies, that, these, big, classes, are, not, sets, which, eliminates, the, paradoxes, since, they, cannot, be, members, of, any, class, von, neumann, also, used, his, axiom, to, prove, the, well, ordering, theorem, like, cantor, he, assumed, that, the, ordinals, form, a, set, the, resulting, contradiction, implies, that, the, class, of, all, ordinals, is, not, a, set, then, his, axiom, provides, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, this, class, and, the, class, of, all, sets, this, correspondence, well, orders, the, class, of, all, sets, which, implies, the, well, ordering, theorem, in, 1930, zermelo, defined, models, of, set, theory, that, satisfy, von, neumann, s, axiom, the, concept, of, the, existence, of, an, actual, infinity, was, an, important, shared, concern, within, the, realms, of, mathematics, philosophy, and, religion, preserving, the, orthodoxy, of, the, relationship, between, god, and, mathematics, although, not, in, the, same, form, as, held, by, his, critics, was, long, a, concern, of, cantor, s, he, directly, addressed, this, intersection, between, these, disciplines, in, the, introduction, to, his, grundlagen, einer, allgemeinen, mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where, he, stressed, the, connection, between, his, view, of, the, infinite, and, the, philosophical, one, to, cantor, his, mathematical, views, were, intrinsically, linked, to, their, philosophical, and, theological, implications, he, identified, the, absolute, infinite, with, god, and, he, considered, his, work, on, transfinite, numbers, to, have, been, directly, communicated, to, him, by, god, who, had, chosen, cantor, to, reveal, them, to, the, world, he, was, a, devout, lutheran, whose, explicit, christian, beliefs, shaped, his, philosophy, of, science, joseph, dauben, has, traced, the, effect, cantor, s, christian, convictions, had, on, the, development, of, transfinite, set, theory, debate, among, mathematicians, grew, out, of, opposing, views, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, regarding, the, nature, of, actual, infinity, some, held, to, the, view, that, infinity, was, an, abstraction, which, was, not, mathematically, legitimate, and, denied, its, existence, mathematicians, from, three, major, schools, of, thought, constructivism, and, its, two, offshoots, intuitionism, and, finitism, opposed, cantor, s, theories, in, this, matter, for, constructivists, such, as, kronecker, this, rejection, of, actual, infinity, stems, from, fundamental, disagreement, with, the, idea, that, nonconstructive, proofs, such, as, cantor, s, diagonal, argument, are, sufficient, proof, that, something, exists, holding, instead, that, constructive, proofs, are, required, intuitionism, also, rejects, the, idea, that, actual, infinity, is, an, expression, of, any, sort, of, reality, but, arrive, at, the, decision, via, a, different, route, than, constructivism, firstly, cantor, s, argument, rests, on, logic, to, prove, the, existence, of, transfinite, numbers, as, an, actual, mathematical, entity, whereas, intuitionists, hold, that, mathematical, entities, cannot, be, reduced, to, logical, propositions, originating, instead, in, the, intuitions, of, the, mind, secondly, the, notion, of, infinity, as, an, expression, of, reality, is, itself, disallowed, in, intuitionism, since, the, human, mind, cannot, intuitively, construct, an, infinite, set, mathematicians, such, as, l, e, j, brouwer, and, especially, henri, poincar, adopted, an, intuitionist, stance, against, cantor, s, work, finally, wittgenstein, s, attacks, were, finitist, he, believed, that, cantor, s, diagonal, argument, conflated, the, intension, of, a, set, of, cardinal, or, real, numbers, with, its, extension, thus, conflating, the, concept, of, rules, for, generating, a, set, with, an, actual, set, some, christian, theologians, saw, cantor, s, work, as, a, challenge, to, the, uniqueness, of, the, absolute, infinity, in, the, nature, of, god, in, particular, neo, thomist, thinkers, saw, the, existence, of, an, actual, infinity, that, consisted, of, something, other, than, god, as, jeopardizing, god, s, exclusive, claim, to, supreme, infinity, cantor, strongly, believed, that, this, view, was, a, misinterpretation, of, infinity, and, was, convinced, that, set, theory, could, help, correct, this, mistake, the, transfinite, species, are, just, as, much, at, the, disposal, of, the, intentions, of, the, creator, and, his, absolute, boundless, will, as, are, the, finite, numbers, prominent, neo, scholastic, german, philosopher, constantin, gutberlet, was, in, favor, of, such, theory, holding, that, it, didn, t, oppose, the, nature, of, god, cantor, also, believed, that, his, theory, of, transfinite, numbers, ran, counter, to, both, materialism, and, determinism, and, was, shocked, when, he, realized, that, he, was, the, only, faculty, member, at, halle, who, did, not, hold, to, deterministic, philosophical, beliefs, it, was, important, to, cantor, that, his, philosophy, provided, an, organic, explanation, of, nature, and, in, his, 1883, grundlagen, he, said, that, such, an, explanation, could, only, come, about, by, drawing, on, the, resources, of, the, philosophy, of, spinoza, and, leibniz, in, making, these, claims, cantor, may, have, been, influenced, by, f, a, trendelenburg, whose, lecture, courses, he, attended, at, berlin, and, in, turn, cantor, produced, a, latin, commentary, on, book, 1, of, spinoza, s, ethica, trendelenburg, was, also, the, examiner, of, cantor, s, habilitationsschrift, in, 1888, cantor, published, his, correspondence, with, several, philosophers, on, the, philosophical, implications, of, his, set, theory, in, an, extensive, attempt, to, persuade, other, christian, thinkers, and, authorities, to, adopt, his, views, cantor, had, corresponded, with, christian, philosophers, such, as, tilman, pesch, and, joseph, hontheim, as, well, as, theologians, such, as, cardinal, johann, baptist, franzelin, who, once, replied, by, equating, the, theory, of, transfinite, numbers, with, pantheism, although, later, this, cardinal, accepted, the, theory, as, valid, due, to, some, clarifications, from, cantor, s, cantor, even, sent, one, letter, directly, to, pope, leo, xiii, himself, and, addressed, several, pamphlets, to, him, cantor, s, philosophy, on, the, nature, of, numbers, led, him, to, affirm, a, belief, in, the, freedom, of, mathematics, to, posit, and, prove, concepts, apart, from, the, realm, of, physical, phenomena, as, expressions, within, an, internal, reality, the, only, restrictions, on, this, metaphysical, system, are, that, all, mathematical, concepts, must, be, devoid, of, internal, contradiction, and, that, they, follow, from, existing, definitions, axioms, and, theorems, this, belief, is, summarized, in, his, assertion, that, the, essence, of, mathematics, is, its, freedom, these, ideas, parallel, those, of, edmund, husserl, whom, cantor, had, met, in, halle, meanwhile, cantor, himself, was, fiercely, opposed, to, infinitesimals, describing, them, as, both, an, abomination, and, the, cholera, bacillus, of, mathematics, cantor, s, 1883, paper, reveals, that, he, was, well, aware, of, the, opposition, his, ideas, were, encountering, i, realize, that, in, this, undertaking, i, place, myself, in, a, certain, opposition, to, views, widely, held, concerning, the, mathematical, infinite, and, to, opinions, frequently, defended, on, the, nature, of, numbers, hence, he, devotes, much, space, to, justifying, his, earlier, work, asserting, that, mathematical, concepts, may, be, freely, introduced, as, long, as, they, are, free, of, contradiction, and, defined, in, terms, of, previously, accepted, concepts, he, also, cites, aristotle, ren, descartes, george, berkeley, gottfried, leibniz, and, bernard, bolzano, on, infinity, instead, he, always, strongly, rejected, immanuel, kant, s, philosophy, in, the, realms, of, both, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, and, metaphysics, he, shared, b, russell, s, motto, kant, or, cantor, and, defined, kant, yonder, sophistical, philistine, who, knew, so, little, mathematics, cantor, s, paternal, grandparents, were, from, copenhagen, and, fled, to, russia, from, the, disruption, of, the, napoleonic, wars, there, is, very, little, direct, information, on, them, cantor, s, father, georg, waldemar, cantor, was, educated, in, the, lutheran, mission, in, saint, petersburg, and, his, correspondence, with, his, son, shows, both, of, them, as, devout, lutherans, very, little, is, known, for, sure, about, georg, waldemar, s, origin, or, education, cantor, s, mother, maria, anna, b, hm, was, an, austro, hungarian, born, in, saint, petersburg, and, baptized, roman, catholic, she, converted, to, protestantism, upon, marriage, however, there, is, a, letter, from, cantor, s, brother, louis, to, their, mother, stating, m, gen, wir, zehnmal, von, juden, abstammen, und, ich, im, princip, noch, so, sehr, f, r, gleichberechtigung, der, hebr, er, sein, im, socialen, leben, sind, mir, christen, lieber, even, if, we, were, descended, from, jews, ten, times, over, and, even, though, i, may, be, in, principle, completely, in, favour, of, equal, rights, for, hebrews, in, social, life, i, prefer, christians, which, could, be, read, to, imply, that, she, was, of, jewish, ancestry, according, to, biographer, eric, temple, bell, cantor, was, of, jewish, descent, although, both, parents, were, baptized, in, a, 1971, article, entitled, towards, a, biography, of, georg, cantor, the, british, historian, of, mathematics, ivor, grattan, guinness, mentions, annals, of, science, 27, pp, 345, 391, 1971, that, he, was, unable, to, find, evidence, of, jewish, ancestry, he, also, states, that, cantor, s, wife, vally, guttmann, was, jewish, in, a, letter, written, to, paul, tannery, in, 1896, paul, tannery, memoires, scientifique, 13, correspondence, gauthier, villars, paris, 1934, p, 306, cantor, states, that, his, paternal, grandparents, were, members, of, the, sephardic, jewish, community, of, copenhagen, specifically, cantor, states, in, describing, his, father, er, ist, aber, in, kopenhagen, geboren, von, israelitischen, eltern, die, der, dortigen, portugisischen, judengemeinde, he, was, born, in, copenhagen, of, jewish, lit, israelite, parents, from, the, local, portuguese, jewish, community, in, addition, cantor, s, maternal, great, uncle, josef, b, hm, a, hungarian, violinist, has, been, described, as, jewish, which, may, imply, that, cantor, s, mother, was, at, least, partly, descended, from, the, hungarian, jewish, community, in, a, letter, to, bertrand, russell, cantor, described, his, ancestry, and, self, perception, as, follows, neither, my, father, nor, my, mother, were, of, german, blood, the, first, being, a, dane, borne, in, kopenhagen, my, mother, of, austrian, hungar, descension, you, must, know, sir, that, i, am, not, a, regular, just, germain, for, i, am, born, 3, march, 1845, at, saint, peterborough, capital, of, russia, but, i, went, with, my, father, and, mother, and, brothers, and, sister, eleven, years, old, in, the, year, 1856, into, germany, there, were, documented, statements, during, the, 1930s, that, called, this, jewish, ancestry, into, question, more, often, the, question, has, been, discussed, of, whether, georg, cantor, was, of, jewish, origin, about, this, it, is, reported, in, a, notice, of, the, danish, genealogical, institute, in, copenhagen, from, the, year, 1937, concerning, his, father, it, is, hereby, testified, that, georg, woldemar, cantor, born, 1809, or, 1814, is, not, present, in, the, registers, of, the, jewish, community, and, that, he, completely, without, doubt, was, not, a, jew, until, the, 1970s, the, chief, academic, publications, on, cantor, were, two, short, monographs, by, arthur, moritz, sch, nflies, 1927, largely, the, correspondence, with, mittag, leffler, and, fraenkel, 1930, both, were, at, second, and, third, hand, neither, had, much, on, his, personal, life, the, gap, was, largely, filled, by, eric, temple, bell, s, men, of, mathematics, 1937, which, one, of, cantor, s, modern, biographers, describes, as, perhaps, the, most, widely, read, modern, book, on, the, history, of, mathematics, and, as, one, of, the, worst, bell, presents, cantor, s, relationship, with, his, father, as, oedipal, cantor, s, differences, with, kronecker, as, a, quarrel, between, two, jews, and, cantor, s, madness, as, romantic, despair, over, his, failure, to, win, acceptance, for, his, mathematics, grattan, guinness, 1971, found, that, none, of, these, claims, were, true, but, they, may, be, found, in, many, books, of, the, intervening, period, owing, to, the, absence, of, any, other, narrative, there, are, other, legends, independent, of, bell, including, one, that, labels, cantor, s, father, a, foundling, shipped, to, saint, petersburg, by, unknown, parents, a, critique, of, bell, s, book, is, contained, in, joseph, dauben, s, biography, writes, dauben, cantor, devoted, some, of, his, most, vituperative, correspondence, as, well, as, a, portion, of, the, beitr, ge, to, attacking, what, he, described, at, one, point, as, the, infinitesimal, cholera, bacillus, of, mathematics, which, had, spread, from, germany, through, the, work, of, thomae, du, bois, reymond, and, stolz, to, infect, italian, mathematics, any, acceptance, of, infinitesimals, necessarily, meant, that, his, own, theory, of, number, was, incomplete, thus, to, accept, the, work, of, thomae, du, bois, reymond, stolz, and, veronese, was, to, deny, the, perfection, of, cantor, s, own, creation, understandably, cantor, launched, a, thorough, campaign, to, discredit, veronese, s, work, in, every, way, possible
