some, problems, she, believed, were, caused, by, synthetic, pesticides, the, result, was, the, book, silent, spring, 1962, which, brought, environmental, concerns, to, an, unprecedented, share, of, the, american, people, although, silent, spring, was, met, with, fierce, opposition, by, chemical, companies, it, spurred, a, reversal, in, national, pesticide, policy, which, led, to, a, nationwide, ban, on, ddt, and, other, pesticides, it, also, inspired, a, grassroots, environmental, movement, that, led, to, the, creation, of, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, carson, was,

earned, a, master, s, degree, in, zoology, she, had, intended, to, continue, for, a, doctorate, however, in, 1934, carson, was, forced, to, leave, johns, hopkins, to, search, for, a, full, time, teaching, position, to, help, support, her, family, during, the, great, depression, in, 1935, carson, s, father, died, suddenly, worsening, their, already, critical, financial, situation, and, leaving, carson, to, care, for, her, aging, mother, at, the, urging, of, her, undergraduate, biology, mentor, mary, scott, skinker, carson, secured, a, temporary, position, with, the, u, s, bureau, of, fisheries, where, she, wrote, radio, copy, for, a, series, of, weekly, educational, broadcasts, called, romance, under, the, waters, the, series, of, 52, seven, minute, programs, focused, on, aquatic, life, and, was, intended, to, generate, public, interest, in, fish, biology, and, the, bureau, s, work, a, task, that, several, writers, before, carson, had, not, managed, carson, also, began, submitting, articles, on, marine, life, in, the, chesapeake, bay, based, on, her, research, for, the, series, to, local, newspapers, and, magazines, carson, s, supervisor, pleased, with, the, success, of, the, radio, series, asked, her, to, write, the, introduction, to, a, public, brochure, about, the, fisheries, bureau, he, also, worked, to, secure, her, the, first, full, time, position, that, became, available, sitting, for, the, civil, service, exam, she, outscored, all, other, applicants, and, in, 1936, became, the, second, woman, hired, by, the, bureau, of, fisheries, for, a, full, time, professional, position, as, a, junior, aquatic, biologist, using, her, research, and, consultations, with, marine, biologists, as, starting, points, she, wrote, a, steady, stream, of, articles, for, the, baltimore, sun, and, other, newspapers, however, her, family, responsibilities, further, increased, in, january, 1937, when, her, older, sister, died, leaving, carson, as, the, sole, breadwinner, for, her, mother, and, two, nieces, in, july, 1937, the, atlantic, monthly, accepted, a, revised, version, of, an, essay, the, world, of, waters, that, she, originally, wrote, for, her, first, fisheries, bureau, brochure, her, supervisor, had, deemed, it, too, good, for, that, purpose, the, essay, published, as, undersea, was, a, vivid, narrative, of, a, journey, along, the, ocean, floor, it, marked, a, major, turning, point, in, carson, s, writing, career, publishing, house, simon, schuster, impressed, by, undersea, contacted, carson, and, suggested, that, she, expand, it, into, a, book, several, years, of, writing, resulted, in, under, the, sea, wind, 1941, which, received, excellent, reviews, but, sold, poorly, in, the, meantime, carson, s, article, writing, success, continued, with, her, features, appearing, in, sun, magazine, nature, and, collier, s, carson, attempted, to, leave, the, bureau, by, then, transformed, into, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, in, 1945, however, few, jobs, for, naturalists, were, available, since, most, money, for, science, was, focused, on, technical, fields, in, the, wake, of, the, manhattan, project, in, mid, 1945, carson, first, encountered, the, subject, of, ddt, a, revolutionary, new, pesticide, lauded, as, the, insect, bomb, after, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, that, was, only, beginning, to, undergo, tests, for, safety, and, ecological, effects, ddt, was, one, of, carson, s, many, writing, interests, at, the, time, but, editors, found, the, subject, unappealing, she, published, nothing, on, ddt, until, 1962, carson, rose, within, the, fish, and, wildlife, service, and, in, 1945, was, supervising, a, small, writing, staff, in, 1949, she, was, appointed, chief, editor, of, publications, which, allowed, her, increased, opportunities, for, fieldwork, and, freedom, in, choosing, her, writing, projects, however, it, also, entailed, increasingly, tedious, administrative, responsibilities, by, 1948, carson, was, working, on, material, for, a, second, book, and, decided, to, begin, a, transition, to, writing, full, time, that, year, she, took, on, a, literary, agent, marie, rodell, they, formed, a, close, professional, relationship, that, would, last, the, rest, of, carson, s, career, oxford, university, press, expressed, interest, in, carson, s, book, proposal, for, a, life, history, of, the, ocean, spurring, her, to, complete, by, early, 1950, the, manuscript, of, what, would, become, the, sea, around, us, chapters, appeared, in, science, digest, and, the, yale, review, which, published, a, chapter, the, birth, of, an, island, which, won, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, s, george, westinghouse, science, writing, prize, beginning, in, june, 1951, nine, chapters, were, serialized, in, the, new, yorker, on, july, 2, 1951, the, book, was, published, by, oxford, university, press, the, sea, around, us, remained, on, the, new, york, times, bestseller, list, for, 86, weeks, was, abridged, by, reader, s, digest, won, the, 1952, national, book, award, for, nonfiction, and, the, john, burroughs, medal, and, resulted, in, carson, being, awarded, two, honorary, doctorates, she, licensed, a, documentary, film, based, on, it, the, sea, whose, success, led, to, republication, of, under, the, sea, wind, which, became, a, bestseller, with, success, came, financial, security, in, 1952, carson, was, able, to, give, up, her, job, in, order, to, concentrate, on, writing, full, time, carson, was, inundated, with, requests, for, speaking, engagements, fan, mail, and, other, correspondence, regarding, the, sea, around, us, along, with, work, on, the, script, that, she, had, secured, the, right, to, review, she, was, very, unhappy, with, the, final, version, of, the, script, by, writer, director, and, producer, irwin, allen, she, found, it, untrue, to, the, atmosphere, of, the, book, and, scientifically, embarrassing, describing, it, as, a, cross, between, a, believe, it, or, not, and, a, breezy, travelogue, however, she, discovered, that, her, right, to, review, the, script, did, not, extend, to, any, control, over, its, content, this, led, to, many, scientific, inconsistencies, inside, the, film, despite, carson, s, requests, to, resolve, these, problems, allen, went, forward, with, the, script, he, succeeded, in, producing, a, very, successful, documentary, it, went, on, to, win, the, 1953, academy, award, for, best, documentary, feature, however, carson, was, so, embittered, by, the, experience, that, she, never, again, sold, film, rights, to, her, work, carson, met, dorothy, m, freeman, in, the, summer, of, 1953, on, southport, island, maine, freeman, had, written, to, carson, welcoming, her, to, the, area, when, she, had, heard, that, the, famous, author, was, to, become, her, neighbor, it, was, the, beginning, of, a, devoted, friendship, that, lasted, the, rest, of, carson, s, life, their, relationship, was, conducted, mainly, through, letters, and, during, summers, spent, together, in, maine, over, 12, years, they, exchanged, around, 900, letters, many, of, these, were, published, in, the, book, always, rachel, published, in, 1995, by, beacon, press, carson, s, biographer, linda, j, lear, writes, that, carson, sorely, needed, a, devoted, friend, and, kindred, spirit, who, would, listen, to, her, without, advising, and, accept, her, wholly, the, writer, as, well, as, the, woman, she, found, this, in, freeman, the, two, women, had, common, interests, nature, chief, among, them, and, began, exchanging, letters, regularly, while, apart, they, shared, summers, for, the, remainder, of, carson, s, life, and, met, whenever, else, their, schedules, permitted, concerning, the, depth, of, their, relationship, commentators, have, said, the, expression, of, their, love, was, limited, almost, wholly, to, letters, and, very, occasional, farewell, kisses, or, holding, of, hands, freeman, shared, parts, of, carson, s, letters, with, her, husband, to, help, him, understand, the, relationship, but, much, of, their, correspondence, was, carefully, guarded, some, believe, freeman, and, carson, s, relationship, was, romantic, in, nature, one, of, the, letters, from, carson, to, freeman, reads, but, oh, darling, i, want, to, be, with, you, so, terribly, that, it, hurts, while, in, another, freeman, writes, i, love, you, beyond, expression, my, love, is, boundless, as, the, sea, carson, s, last, letter, to, freeman, before, her, death, ends, with, never, forget, dear, one, how, deeply, i, have, loved, you, all, these, years, shortly, before, carson, s, death, she, and, freeman, destroyed, hundreds, of, letters, the, surviving, correspondence, was, published, in, 1995, as, always, rachel, the, letters, of, rachel, carson, and, dorothy, freeman, 1952, 1964, an, intimate, portrait, of, a, remarkable, friendship, edited, by, martha, freeman, dorothy, s, granddaughter, who, wrote, at, publication, a, few, comments, in, early, letters, indicate, that, rachel, and, dorothy, were, initially, cautious, about, the, romantic, tone, and, terminology, of, their, correspondence, i, believe, this, caution, prompted, their, destruction, of, some, letters, within, the, first, two, years, of, their, friendship, according, to, one, reviewer, the, pair, fit, carolyn, heilbrun, s, characterization, of, a, strong, female, friendship, where, what, matters, is, not, whether, friends, are, homosexual, or, heterosexual, lovers, or, not, but, whether, they, share, the, wonderful, energy, of, work, in, the, public, sphere, according, to, her, biographer, linda, lear, there, was, a, disagreement, about, the, final, arrangements, for, rachel, her, brother, robert, carson, insisted, that, her, cremated, remains, be, buried, beside, their, mother, in, maryland, this, was, against, her, wishes, to, be, buried, in, maine, in, the, end, a, compromise, was, reached, carson, s, wishes, were, carried, out, by, an, organizing, committee, including, her, agent, marie, rodell, her, editor, paul, brooks, and, dorothy, freeman, in, the, spring, of, 1964, dorothy, received, half, of, rachel, s, ashes, in, the, mail, sent, to, her, by, robert, carson, in, the, summer, of, that, year, dorothy, carried, out, rachel, s, final, wishes, scattering, her, ashes, along, the, rocky, shores, of, sheepscot, bay, in, maine, early, in, 1953, carson, began, library, and, field, research, on, the, ecology, and, organisms, of, the, atlantic, shore, in, 1955, she, completed, the, third, volume, of, her, sea, trilogy, the, edge, of, the, sea, which, focuses, on, life, in, coastal, ecosystems, particularly, along, the, eastern, seaboard, it, appeared, in, the, new, yorker, in, two, condensed, installments, shortly, before, its, october, 26, book, release, by, houghton, mifflin, again, a, new, publisher, by, this, time, carson, s, reputation, for, clear, and, poetical, prose, was, well, established, the, edge, of, the, sea, received, highly, favorable, reviews, if, not, quite, as, enthusiastic, as, for, the, sea, around, us, through, 1955, and, 1956, carson, worked, on, several, projects, including, the, script, for, an, omnibus, episode, something, about, the, sky, and, wrote, articles, for, popular, magazines, her, plan, for, the, next, book, was, to, address, evolution, however, the, publication, of, julian, huxley, s, evolution, in, action, and, her, own, difficulty, in, finding, a, clear, and, compelling, approach, to, the, topic, led, her, to, abandon, the, project, instead, her, interests, were, turning, to, conservation, she, considered, an, environment, themed, book, project, tentatively, titled, remembrance, of, the, earth, and, became, involved, with, the, nature, conservancy, and, other, conservation, groups, she, also, made, plans, to, buy, and, preserve, from, development, an, area, in, maine, she, and, freeman, called, the, lost, woods, in, early, 1957, a, family, tragedy, struck, for, the, third, time, when, one, of, her, nieces, she, had, cared, for, since, the, 1940s, died, at, the, age, of, 31, leaving, her, 5, year, old, son, roger, christie, an, orphan, carson, took, on, the, responsibility, for, roger, when, she, adopted, him, along, with, caring, for, her, aging, mother, carson, moved, to, silver, spring, maryland, to, care, for, roger, and, spent, much, of, 1957, putting, together, a, new, living, situation, and, studying, specific, environmental, threats, by, late, 1957, carson, was, closely, following, federal, proposals, for, widespread, pesticide, spraying, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, planned, to, eradicate, fire, ants, other, spraying, programs, involving, chlorinated, hydrocarbons, and, organophosphates, were, on, the, rise, for, the, rest, of, her, life, carson, s, main, professional, focus, would, be, the, dangers, of, pesticide, overuse, silent, spring, carson, s, most, influential, book, was, published, by, houghton, mifflin, on, september, 27, 1962, the, book, described, the, harmful, effects, of, pesticides, on, the, environment, and, is, widely, credited, with, helping, launch, the, environmental, movement, carson, was, not, the, first, or, the, only, person, to, raise, concern, about, ddt, but, her, combination, of, scientific, knowledge, and, poetic, writing, reached, a, broad, audience, and, helped, to, focus, opposition, to, ddt, use, in, 1994, an, edition, of, silent, spring, was, published, with, an, introduction, written, by, vice, president, al, gore, in, 2012, silent, spring, was, designated, a, national, historic, chemical, landmark, by, the, american, chemical, society, for, its, role, in, the, development, of, the, modern, environmental, movement, starting, in, the, mid, 1940s, carson, had, become, concerned, about, the, use, of, synthetic, pesticides, many, of, which, had, been, developed, through, the, military, funding, of, science, since, world, war, ii, however, the, united, states, federal, government, s, 1957, gypsy, moth, now, called, spongy, moth, eradication, program, prompted, carson, to, devote, her, research, and, her, next, book, to, pesticides, and, environmental, poisons, the, gypsy, moth, program, involved, aerial, spraying, of, ddt, and, other, pesticides, mixed, with, fuel, oil, including, the, spraying, of, private, land, landowners, on, long, island, filed, a, lawsuit, to, have, the, spraying, stopped, and, many, in, affected, regions, followed, the, case, closely, though, the, suit, was, lost, the, supreme, court, granted, petitioners, the, right, to, gain, injunctions, against, potential, environmental, damage, in, the, future, this, laid, the, basis, for, later, successful, environmental, actions, the, audubon, naturalist, society, also, actively, opposed, such, spraying, programs, and, recruited, carson, to, help, make, public, the, government, s, exact, spraying, practices, and, the, related, research, carson, began, the, four, year, project, of, what, would, become, silent, spring, by, gathering, examples, of, environmental, damage, attributed, to, ddt, she, also, attempted, to, enlist, others, to, join, the, cause, such, as, essayist, e, b, white, and, several, journalists, and, scientists, by, 1958, carson, had, arranged, a, book, deal, with, plans, to, co, write, with, newsweek, science, journalist, edwin, diamond, however, when, the, new, yorker, commissioned, a, long, and, well, paid, article, on, the, topic, from, carson, she, began, considering, writing, more, than, simply, the, introduction, and, conclusion, as, planned, soon, it, was, a, solo, project, diamond, would, later, write, one, of, the, harshest, critiques, of, silent, spring, as, her, research, progressed, carson, found, a, sizable, community, of, scientists, who, were, documenting, the, physiological, and, environmental, effects, of, pesticides, she, also, took, advantage, of, her, connections, with, many, government, scientists, who, supplied, her, with, confidential, information, from, reading, the, scientific, literature, and, interviewing, scientists, carson, found, two, scientific, camps, when, it, came, to, pesticides, those, who, dismissed, the, possible, danger, of, pesticide, spraying, barring, conclusive, proof, and, those, who, were, open, to, the, possibility, of, harm, and, willing, to, consider, alternative, methods, such, as, biological, pest, control, she, also, found, significant, support, and, extensive, evidence, from, a, group, of, biodynamic, agriculture, organic, market, gardeners, their, adviser, dr, ehrenfried, pfeiffer, other, contacts, and, their, suite, of, legal, actions, 1957, 1960, against, the, u, s, government, according, to, recent, research, by, paull, 2013, this, may, have, been, the, primary, and, for, strategic, reasons, uncredited, source, for, carson, s, book, marjorie, spock, and, mary, t, richards, of, long, island, new, york, contested, the, aerial, spraying, of, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, ddt, they, compiled, their, evidence, and, shared, it, with, carson, who, used, it, their, extensive, contacts, and, the, trial, transcripts, as, a, primary, input, for, silent, spring, carson, wrote, of, the, content, as, a, gold, mine, of, information, and, says, i, feel, guilty, about, the, mass, of, your, material, i, have, here, and, makes, multiple, references, to, pfeiffer, and, his, correspondence, by, 1959, the, usda, s, agricultural, research, service, responded, to, the, criticism, by, carson, and, others, with, a, public, service, film, fire, ant, on, trial, carson, characterized, it, as, flagrant, propaganda, that, ignored, the, dangers, that, spraying, pesticides, especially, dieldrin, and, heptachlor, posed, to, humans, and, wildlife, that, spring, carson, wrote, a, letter, published, in, the, washington, post, that, attributed, the, recent, decline, in, bird, populations, in, her, words, the, silencing, of, birds, to, pesticide, overuse, that, was, also, the, year, of, the, great, cranberry, scandal, the, 1957, 1958, and, 1959, crops, of, u, s, cranberries, were, found, to, contain, high, levels, of, the, herbicide, aminotriazole, which, caused, cancer, in, laboratory, rats, and, the, sale, of, all, cranberry, products, was, halted, carson, attended, the, subsequent, fda, hearings, on, revising, pesticide, regulations, she, came, away, discouraged, by, the, aggressive, tactics, of, the, chemical, industry, representatives, which, included, expert, testimony, that, was, firmly, contradicted, by, the, bulk, of, the, scientific, literature, she, had, been, studying, she, also, wondered, about, the, possible, financial, inducements, behind, certain, pesticide, programs, research, at, the, library, of, medicine, of, the, national, institutes, of, health, brought, carson, into, contact, with, medical, researchers, investigating, the, gamut, of, cancer, causing, chemicals, of, particular, significance, was, the, work, of, national, cancer, institute, researcher, and, environmental, cancer, section, founding, director, wilhelm, hueper, who, classified, many, pesticides, as, carcinogens, carson, and, her, research, assistant, jeanne, davis, with, the, help, of, nih, librarian, dorothy, algire, found, evidence, to, support, the, pesticide, cancer, connection, to, carson, the, evidence, for, the, toxicity, of, a, wide, array, of, synthetic, pesticides, was, clear, cut, though, such, conclusions, were, very, controversial, beyond, the, small, community, of, scientists, studying, pesticide, carcinogenesis, by, 1960, carson, had, more, than, enough, research, material, and, the, writing, was, progressing, rapidly, in, addition, to, the, thorough, literature, search, she, had, investigated, hundreds, of, individual, incidents, of, pesticide, exposure, and, the, human, sickness, and, ecological, damage, that, resulted, however, in, january, a, duodenal, ulcer, followed, by, several, infections, kept, her, bedridden, for, weeks, greatly, delaying, the, completion, of, silent, spring, as, she, was, nearing, full, recovery, in, march, just, as, she, was, completing, drafts, of, the, two, cancer, chapters, of, her, book, she, discovered, cysts, in, her, left, breast, one, of, which, necessitated, a, mastectomy, though, her, doctor, described, the, procedure, as, precautionary, and, recommended, no, further, treatment, by, december, carson, discovered, that, the, tumor, was, malignant, and, the, cancer, had, metastasized, her, research, was, also, delayed, by, revision, work, for, a, new, edition, of, the, sea, around, us, and, by, a, collaborative, photo, essay, with, erich, hartmann, most, of, the, research, and, writing, was, done, by, the, fall, of, 1960, except, for, the, discussion, of, recent, research, on, biological, pest, controls, and, investigations, of, a, handful, of, new, pesticides, however, further, health, troubles, slowed, the, final, revisions, in, 1961, and, early, 1962, while, writing, the, book, carson, chose, to, hide, her, illness, so, that, the, pesticide, companies, could, not, use, it, against, her, she, worried, that, if, the, companies, knew, they, would, use, it, as, ammunition, to, make, her, book, look, untrustworthy, and, biased, finding, a, title, for, the, book, proved, difficult, silent, spring, was, initially, suggested, as, a, title, for, the, chapter, on, birds, by, august, 1961, carson, finally, agreed, to, the, suggestion, of, her, literary, agent, marie, rodell, silent, spring, would, be, a, metaphorical, title, for, the, entire, book, suggesting, a, bleak, future, for, the, whole, natural, world, rather, than, a, single, chapter, title, about, the, literal, absence, of, birdsong, with, carson, s, approval, editor, paul, brooks, at, houghton, mifflin, arranged, for, illustrations, by, louis, and, lois, darling, who, also, designed, the, cover, the, final, writing, was, the, first, chapter, a, fable, for, tomorrow, which, carson, intended, as, a, gentle, introduction, to, what, might, otherwise, be, a, forbiddingly, serious, topic, by, mid, 1962, brooks, and, carson, had, essentially, finished, the, editing, and, were, laying, the, groundwork, for, promoting, the, book, by, sending, the, manuscript, out, to, select, individuals, for, final, suggestions, biographer, mark, hamilton, lytle, writes, that, carson, quite, self, consciously, decided, to, write, a, book, calling, into, question, the, paradigm, of, scientific, progress, that, defined, post, war, american, culture, the, overriding, theme, of, silent, spring, is, the, powerful, and, often, adverse, effect, humans, have, on, the, natural, world, carson, s, main, argument, is, that, pesticides, have, detrimental, effects, on, the, environment, they, are, more, properly, termed, biocides, she, argues, because, their, effects, are, rarely, limited, to, the, target, pests, ddt, is, a, prime, example, but, other, synthetic, pesticides, come, under, scrutiny, many, of, which, are, subject, to, bioaccumulation, carson, also, accuses, the, chemical, industry, of, intentionally, spreading, disinformation, and, public, officials, of, accepting, industry, claims, uncritically, most, of, the, book, is, devoted, to, pesticides, effects, on, natural, ecosystems, however, four, chapters, also, detail, cases, of, human, pesticide, poisoning, cancer, and, other, illnesses, attributed, to, pesticides, regarding, ddt, and, cancer, the, subject, of, so, much, subsequent, debate, carson, only, briefly, mentions, the, topic, in, laboratory, tests, on, animal, subjects, ddt, has, produced, suspicious, liver, tumors, scientists, of, the, food, and, drug, administration, who, reported, the, discovery, of, these, tumors, were, uncertain, how, to, classify, them, but, felt, there, was, some, justification, for, considering, them, low, grade, hepatic, cell, carcinomas, dr, hueper, now, gives, ddt, the, definite, rating, of, a, chemical, carcinogen, carson, predicted, increased, consequences, in, the, future, especially, as, targeted, pests, develop, pesticide, resistance, at, the, same, time, weakened, ecosystems, fall, prey, to, unanticipated, invasive, species, the, book, closes, with, a, call, for, a, biotic, approach, to, pest, control, as, an, alternative, to, chemical, pesticides, regarding, ddt, carson, never, called, for, an, outright, ban, part, of, the, argument, she, made, in, silent, spring, was, that, even, if, ddt, and, other, insecticides, had, no, environmental, side, effects, their, indiscriminate, overuse, was, counter, productive, because, it, would, create, insect, resistance, making, them, useless, in, eliminating, the, target, insect, populations, no, responsible, person, contends, that, insect, borne, disease, should, be, ignored, the, question, that, has, now, urgently, presented, itself, is, whether, it, is, either, wise, or, responsible, to, attack, the, problem, by, methods, that, are, rapidly, making, it, worse, the, world, has, heard, much, of, the, triumphant, war, against, disease, by, controlling, insect, vectors, of, infection, however, it, has, heard, little, of, the, other, side, of, the, story, the, defeats, the, short, lived, triumphs, that, now, strongly, support, the, alarming, view, that, the, insect, enemy, has, been, made, actually, stronger, by, our, efforts, even, worse, we, may, have, destroyed, our, very, means, of, fighting, carson, further, noted, that, malaria, programmes, are, threatened, by, resistance, among, mosquitoes, and, emphasized, the, advice, given, by, the, director, of, holland, s, plant, protection, service, practical, advice, should, be, spray, as, little, as, you, possibly, can, rather, than, spray, to, the, limit, of, your, capacity, pressure, on, the, pest, population, should, always, be, as, slight, as, possible, carson, and, the, others, involved, with, the, publication, of, silent, spring, expected, fierce, criticism, they, were, particularly, concerned, about, the, possibility, of, being, sued, for, libel, carson, was, also, undergoing, radiation, therapy, to, combat, her, spreading, cancer, and, expected, to, have, little, energy, to, devote, to, defending, her, work, and, responding, to, critics, in, preparation, for, the, anticipated, attacks, carson, and, her, agent, attempted, to, amass, as, many, prominent, supporters, as, possible, before, the, book, s, release, most, of, the, book, s, scientific, chapters, were, reviewed, by, scientists, with, relevant, expertise, among, whom, carson, found, strong, support, carson, attended, the, white, house, conference, on, conservation, in, may, 1962, houghton, mifflin, distributed, proof, copies, of, silent, spring, to, many, of, the, delegates, and, promoted, the, upcoming, new, yorker, serialization, among, many, others, carson, also, sent, a, proof, copy, to, supreme, court, associate, justice, william, o, douglas, a, longtime, environmental, advocate, who, had, argued, against, the, court, s, rejection, of, the, long, island, pesticide, spraying, case, and, who, had, provided, carson, with, some, of, the, material, included, in, her, chapter, on, herbicides, though, silent, spring, had, generated, a, relatively, high, level, of, interest, based, on, pre, publication, promotion, this, became, much, more, intense, with, the, serialization, in, the, new, yorker, which, began, on, june, 16, 1962, issue, this, brought, the, book, to, the, attention, of, the, chemical, industry, and, its, lobbyists, and, a, wide, swath, of, the, american, populace, around, that, time, carson, also, learned, that, silent, spring, had, been, selected, as, the, book, of, the, month, for, october, as, she, put, it, this, would, carry, it, to, farms, and, hamlets, all, over, that, country, that, don, t, know, what, a, bookstore, looks, like, much, less, the, new, yorker, other, publicity, included, a, positive, editorial, in, the, new, york, times, and, excerpts, of, the, serialized, version, in, audubon, magazine, with, another, round, of, publicity, in, july, and, august, as, chemical, companies, responded, the, story, of, the, birth, defect, causing, drug, thalidomide, broke, just, before, the, book, s, publication, as, well, inviting, comparisons, between, carson, and, frances, oldham, kelsey, the, food, and, drug, administration, reviewer, who, had, blocked, the, drug, s, sale, in, the, united, states, in, the, weeks, leading, up, to, the, september, 27, 1962, publication, there, was, strong, opposition, to, silent, spring, from, the, chemical, industry, dupont, a, main, manufacturer, of, ddt, and, 2, 4, d, and, velsicol, chemical, corporation, exclusive, manufacturer, of, chlordane, and, heptachlor, were, among, the, first, to, respond, dupont, compiled, an, extensive, report, on, the, book, s, press, coverage, and, estimated, impact, on, public, opinion, velsicol, threatened, legal, action, against, houghton, mifflin, and, the, new, yorker, and, audubon, unless, the, planned, silent, spring, features, were, canceled, chemical, industry, representatives, and, lobbyists, also, lodged, a, range, of, non, specific, complaints, some, anonymously, chemical, companies, and, associated, organizations, produced, a, number, of, their, own, brochures, and, articles, promoting, and, defending, pesticide, use, however, carson, s, and, the, publishers, lawyers, were, confident, in, the, vetting, process, silent, spring, had, undergone, the, magazine, and, book, publications, proceeded, as, planned, as, did, the, large, book, of, the, month, printing, which, included, a, pamphlet, endorsing, the, book, by, william, o, douglas, american, cyanamid, biochemist, robert, white, stevens, and, former, cyanamid, chemist, thomas, jukes, were, among, the, most, aggressive, critics, especially, of, carson, s, analysis, of, ddt, according, to, white, stevens, if, man, were, to, follow, the, teachings, of, miss, carson, we, would, return, to, the, dark, ages, and, the, insects, and, diseases, and, vermin, would, once, again, inherit, the, earth, others, went, further, attacking, carson, s, scientific, credentials, because, her, training, was, in, marine, biology, rather, than, biochemistry, and, her, character, white, stevens, labeled, her, a, fanatic, defender, of, the, cult, of, the, balance, of, nature, while, former, u, s, secretary, of, agriculture, ezra, taft, benson, in, a, letter, to, former, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, reportedly, concluded, that, because, she, was, unmarried, despite, being, physically, attractive, she, was, probably, a, communist, many, critics, repeatedly, asserted, that, she, was, calling, for, the, elimination, of, all, pesticides, however, carson, had, made, it, clear, she, was, not, advocating, the, banning, or, complete, withdrawal, of, helpful, pesticides, but, was, instead, encouraging, responsible, and, carefully, managed, use, with, an, awareness, of, the, chemicals, impact, on, the, entire, ecosystem, in, fact, she, concludes, her, section, on, ddt, in, silent, spring, not, by, urging, a, total, ban, but, with, advice, for, spraying, as, little, as, possible, to, limit, the, development, of, resistance, the, academic, community, including, prominent, defenders, such, as, h, j, muller, loren, eiseley, clarence, cottam, and, frank, egler, by, and, large, backed, the, book, s, scientific, claims, public, opinion, soon, turned, carson, s, way, as, well, the, chemical, industry, campaign, backfired, as, the, controversy, greatly, increased, public, awareness, of, potential, pesticide, dangers, as, well, as, silent, spring, book, sales, pesticide, use, became, a, major, public, issue, especially, after, the, cbs, reports, tv, special, the, silent, spring, of, rachel, carson, that, aired, april, 3, 1963, the, program, included, segments, of, carson, reading, from, silent, spring, and, interviews, with, several, other, experts, mostly, critics, including, white, stevens, according, to, biographer, linda, lear, in, juxtaposition, to, the, wild, eyed, loud, voiced, dr, robert, white, stevens, in, white, lab, coat, carson, appeared, anything, but, the, hysterical, alarmist, that, her, critics, contended, reactions, from, the, estimated, audience, of, ten, to, fifteen, million, were, overwhelmingly, positive, and, the, program, spurred, a, congressional, review, of, pesticide, dangers, and, the, public, release, of, a, pesticide, report, by, the, president, s, science, advisory, committee, within, a, year, or, so, of, publication, the, attacks, on, the, book, and, carson, had, largely, lost, momentum, in, one, of, her, last, public, appearances, carson, testified, before, president, john, f, kennedy, s, science, advisory, committee, the, committee, issued, its, report, on, may, 15, 1963, largely, backing, carson, s, scientific, claims, following, the, report, s, release, she, also, testified, before, a, united, states, senate, subcommittee, to, make, policy, recommendations, though, carson, received, hundreds, of, other, speaking, invitations, she, could, not, accept, the, great, majority, of, them, her, health, was, steadily, declining, as, her, cancer, outpaced, the, radiation, therapy, with, only, brief, periods, of, remission, she, spoke, as, much, as, she, was, physically, able, however, including, a, notable, appearance, on, the, today, show, and, speeches, at, several, dinners, held, in, her, honor, in, late, 1963, she, received, a, flurry, of, awards, and, honors, the, audubon, medal, from, the, national, audubon, society, the, cullum, geographical, medal, from, the, american, geographical, society, and, induction, into, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, letters, weakened, from, breast, cancer, and, her, treatment, regimen, carson, became, ill, with, a, respiratory, virus, in, january, 1964, her, condition, worsened, and, in, february, doctors, found, that, she, had, severe, anemia, from, her, radiation, treatments, in, march, they, discovered, that, the, cancer, had, reached, her, liver, she, died, of, a, heart, attack, on, april, 14, 1964, in, her, home, in, silver, spring, maryland, her, body, was, cremated, and, some, of, her, ashes, were, buried, beside, her, mother, at, parklawn, memorial, gardens, in, rockville, maryland, the, rest, were, scattered, along, the, coast, of, squirrel, island, near, sheepscot, river, in, maine, carson, bequeathed, her, manuscripts, and, papers, to, yale, university, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, state, of, the, art, preservations, facilities, of, the, beinecke, rare, book, manuscript, library, her, longtime, agent, and, literary, executor, marie, rodell, spent, nearly, two, years, organizing, and, cataloging, carson, s, papers, and, correspondence, distributing, all, the, letters, to, their, senders, so, that, only, what, each, correspondent, approved, would, be, submitted, to, the, archive, in, 1965, rodell, arranged, for, the, publication, of, an, essay, carson, had, intended, to, expand, into, a, book, the, sense, of, wonder, the, essay, which, was, combined, with, photographs, by, charles, pratt, and, others, exhorts, parents, to, help, their, children, experience, the, lasting, pleasures, of, contact, with, the, natural, world, available, to, anyone, who, will, place, himself, under, the, influence, of, earth, sea, and, sky, and, their, amazing, life, in, addition, to, the, letters, in, always, rachel, in, 1998, a, volume, of, carson, s, previously, unpublished, work, was, published, as, lost, woods, the, discovered, writing, of, rachel, carson, edited, by, linda, lear, all, of, carson, s, books, remain, in, print, carson, s, work, had, a, powerful, impact, on, the, environmental, movement, silent, spring, in, particular, was, a, rallying, point, for, the, fledgling, social, movement, in, the, 1960s, according, to, environmental, engineer, and, carson, scholar, h, patricia, hynes, silent, spring, altered, the, balance, of, power, in, the, world, no, one, since, would, be, able, to, sell, pollution, as, the, necessary, underside, of, progress, so, easily, or, uncritically, carson, s, work, and, the, activism, it, inspired, are, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, deep, ecology, movement, and, the, overall, strength, of, the, grassroots, environmental, movement, since, the, 1960s, it, was, also, influential, on, the, rise, of, ecofeminism, and, on, many, feminist, scientists, while, there, remains, no, evidence, that, carson, was, openly, a, women, s, rights, activist, her, work, and, its, subsequent, criticisms, have, left, an, iconic, legacy, for, the, ecofeminist, movement, attacks, on, carson, s, credibility, included, criticism, of, her, credentials, in, which, she, was, labeled, an, amateur, it, was, said, that, her, writing, was, too, emotional, ecofeminist, scholars, argue, that, not, only, was, the, dissenting, rhetoric, gendered, to, paint, carson, as, hysterical, but, was, done, because, her, arguments, challenged, the, capitalist, production, of, large, agri, business, corporations, others, such, as, yaakov, garb, suggest, that, in, addition, to, not, being, a, women, s, rights, activist, carson, also, had, no, anti, capitalist, agenda, and, that, such, attacks, were, unwarranted, additionally, the, way, photos, of, carson, were, used, to, portray, her, are, often, questioned, because, of, few, representations, of, her, engaging, in, work, typical, of, a, scientist, but, instead, of, her, leisure, activities, carson, s, most, direct, legacy, in, the, environmental, movement, was, the, campaign, to, ban, ddt, in, the, united, states, and, related, efforts, to, ban, or, limit, its, use, throughout, the, world, though, environmental, concerns, about, ddt, had, been, considered, by, government, agencies, as, early, as, carson, s, testimony, before, the, president, s, science, advisory, committee, the, 1967, formation, of, the, environmental, defense, fund, was, the, first, significant, milestone, in, the, campaign, against, ddt, the, organization, brought, lawsuits, against, the, government, to, establish, a, citizen, s, right, to, a, clean, environment, and, the, arguments, employed, against, ddt, largely, mirrored, carson, s, by, 1972, the, environmental, defense, fund, and, other, activist, groups, had, succeeded, in, securing, a, phase, out, of, ddt, use, in, the, united, states, except, in, emergency, cases, the, creation, of, the, environmental, protection, agency, epa, by, the, nixon, administration, in, 1970, addressed, another, concern, that, carson, had, brought, to, light, until, then, the, same, agency, the, usda, was, responsible, both, for, regulating, pesticides, and, promoting, the, concerns, of, the, agriculture, industry, carson, saw, this, as, a, conflict, of, interest, since, the, agency, was, not, responsible, for, effects, on, wildlife, or, other, environmental, concerns, beyond, farm, policy, fifteen, years, after, its, creation, one, journalist, described, the, epa, as, the, extended, shadow, of, silent, spring, much, of, the, agency, s, early, work, such, as, enforcing, the, 1972, federal, insecticide, fungicide, and, rodenticide, act, was, directly, related, to, carson, s, work, in, the, 1980s, the, policies, of, the, reagan, administration, emphasized, economic, growth, rolling, back, many, of, the, environmental, policies, adopted, in, response, to, carson, and, her, work, various, groups, ranging, from, government, institutions, to, environmental, and, conservation, organizations, to, scholarly, societies, have, celebrated, carson, s, life, and, work, since, her, death, perhaps, most, significantly, on, june, 9, 1980, carson, was, awarded, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, the, highest, civilian, honor, in, the, united, states, a, 17, great, americans, series, postage, stamp, was, issued, in, her, honor, the, following, year, several, other, countries, have, since, issued, carson, postage, as, well, in, 1973, carson, was, inducted, into, the, national, women, s, hall, of, fame, the, university, of, california, santa, cruz, named, one, of, its, colleges,
