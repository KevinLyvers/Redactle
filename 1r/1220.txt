najm, al, din, mas, ud, gilani, as, the, new, vakil, this, was, because, ismail, had, begun, favoring, the, iranians, more, than, the, qizilbash, who, although, they, had, played, a, crucial, role, in, ismail, s, campaigns, possessed, too, much, power, and, were, no, longer, considered, trustworthy, one, year, later, ismail, forced, the, rulers, of, khuzestan, lorestan, and, kurdistan, to,

the, turcoman, tribes, of, eastern, anatolia, among, tribesmen, who, were, ottoman, subjects, had, inevitably, placed, the, neighbouring, ottoman, empire, and, the, safavid, state, on, a, collision, course, as, the, encyclopaedia, iranica, states, as, orthodox, or, sunni, muslims, the, ottomans, had, reason, to, view, with, alarm, the, progress, of, sh, ideas, in, the, territories, under, their, control, but, there, was, also, a, grave, political, danger, that, the, afaw, ya, if, allowed, to, extend, its, influence, still, further, might, bring, about, the, transfer, of, large, areas, in, asia, minor, from, ottoman, to, persian, allegiance, by, the, early, 1510s, ismail, s, rapidly, expansionist, policies, had, made, the, safavid, border, in, asia, minor, shift, even, further, west, in, 1511, there, was, a, widespread, pro, safavid, rebellion, in, southern, anatolia, by, the, takkalu, qizilbash, tribe, known, as, the, ahkulu, rebellion, and, an, ottoman, army, that, was, sent, in, order, to, put, down, the, rebellion, down, was, defeated, a, large, scale, incursion, into, eastern, anatolia, by, safavid, ghazis, under, n, r, al, al, fa, coincided, with, the, accession, of, sultan, selim, i, in, 1512, to, the, ottoman, throne, and, became, the, casus, belli, which, led, to, selim, s, decision, to, invade, safavid, iran, two, years, later, selim, and, ismail, had, been, exchanging, a, series, of, belligerent, letters, prior, to, the, attack, while, the, safavid, forces, were, at, chaldiran, and, planning, on, how, to, confront, the, ottomans, mohammad, khan, ustajlu, who, served, as, the, governor, of, diyarbak, r, and, nur, ali, khalifa, a, commander, who, knew, how, the, ottomans, fought, proposed, that, they, should, attack, as, quickly, as, possible, this, proposal, was, rejected, by, the, powerful, qizilbash, officer, durmish, khan, shamlu, who, rudely, said, that, mohammad, khan, ustajlu, was, only, interested, in, the, province, which, he, governed, the, proposal, was, rejected, by, ismail, himself, who, said, i, am, not, a, caravan, thief, whatever, is, decreed, by, god, will, occur, selim, i, eventually, defeated, ismail, at, the, battle, of, chaldiran, in, 1514, ismail, s, army, was, more, mobile, and, his, soldiers, were, better, prepared, but, the, ottomans, prevailed, due, in, large, part, to, their, efficient, modern, army, and, possession, of, artillery, black, powder, and, muskets, ismail, was, wounded, and, almost, captured, in, battle, selim, entered, the, iranian, capital, of, tabriz, in, triumph, on, september, 5, but, did, not, linger, a, mutiny, among, his, troops, fearing, a, counterattack, and, entrapment, by, fresh, safavid, forces, called, in, from, the, interior, forced, the, triumphant, ottomans, to, withdraw, prematurely, this, allowed, ismail, to, recover, among, the, booty, from, tabriz, was, ismail, s, favorite, wife, for, whose, release, the, sultan, demanded, huge, concessions, which, were, refused, despite, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, chaldiran, ismail, quickly, recovered, most, of, his, kingdom, from, east, of, the, lake, van, to, the, persian, gulf, however, the, ottomans, managed, to, annex, for, the, first, time, eastern, anatolia, and, parts, of, mesopotamia, as, well, as, briefly, northwestern, iran, the, venetian, ambassador, caterino, zeno, describes, the, events, as, follows, the, monarch, seeing, the, slaughter, began, to, retreat, and, to, turn, about, and, was, about, to, fly, when, sinan, coming, to, the, rescue, at, the, time, of, need, caused, the, artillery, to, be, brought, up, and, fired, on, both, the, janissaries, and, the, persians, the, persian, horses, hearing, the, thunder, of, those, infernal, machines, scattered, and, divided, themselves, over, the, plain, not, obeying, their, riders, bit, or, spur, anymore, from, the, terror, they, were, in, it, is, certainly, said, that, if, it, had, not, been, for, the, artillery, which, terrified, in, the, manner, related, the, persian, horses, which, had, never, before, heard, such, a, din, all, his, forces, would, have, been, routed, and, put, to, edge, of, the, sword, he, also, adds, that, if, the, turks, had, been, beaten, in, the, battle, of, chaldiran, the, power, of, ismail, would, have, become, greater, than, that, of, tamerlane, as, by, the, fame, alone, of, such, a, victory, he, would, have, made, himself, absolute, lord, of, the, east, shah, ismail, s, death, ensued, after, a, few, years, of, a, very, saddening, and, depressing, period, of, his, life, after, the, battle, of, chaldiran, ismail, lost, his, supernatural, air, and, the, aura, of, invincibility, gradually, falling, into, heavy, drinking, of, alcohol, he, retired, to, his, palace, never, again, participated, in, a, military, campaign, and, withdrew, from, active, participation, in, the, affairs, of, the, state, he, left, these, to, his, vizier, mirza, shah, husayn, who, became, his, close, friend, and, drinking, companion, this, allowed, mirza, shah, husayn, to, gain, influence, over, ismail, and, expand, his, authority, mirza, shah, husayn, was, assassinated, in, 1523, by, a, group, of, qizilbash, officers, after, which, ismail, appointed, zakariya, s, son, jalal, al, din, mohammad, tabrizi, as, his, new, vizier, ismail, died, on, 23, may, 1524, at, the, relatively, early, age, of, 36, he, was, buried, in, ardabil, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, tahmasp, i, the, consequences, of, the, defeat, at, chaldiran, were, also, psychological, for, ismail, his, relationships, with, his, qizilbash, followers, were, fundamentally, altered, the, tribal, rivalries, between, the, qizilbash, which, temporarily, ceased, before, the, defeat, at, chaldiran, resurfaced, in, intense, form, immediately, after, the, death, of, ismail, and, led, to, ten, years, of, civil, war, 930, 40, 1524, 33, until, shah, tahmasp, regained, control, of, the, affairs, of, the, state, the, safavids, later, briefly, lost, balkh, and, kandahar, to, the, mughals, and, nearly, lost, herat, to, the, uzbeks, during, ismail, s, reign, mainly, in, the, late, 1510s, the, first, steps, for, the, habsburg, persian, alliance, were, set, as, well, with, charles, v, and, ludwig, ii, of, hungary, being, in, contact, with, a, view, to, combining, against, the, common, ottoman, turkish, enemy, from, an, early, age, ismail, was, acquainted, with, the, iranian, cultural, legacy, when, he, reached, lahijan, in, 1494, he, gifted, mirza, ali, karkiya, a, copy, of, the, medieval, persian, epic, shahnameh, book, of, kings, with, over, 300, illustrations, owing, to, his, fondness, of, iranian, national, legends, ismail, named, three, of, his, four, sons, after, mythological, shahs, and, heroes, of, the, shahnameh, his, oldest, son, was, named, tahmasp, after, the, last, shah, of, the, pishdadian, dynasty, his, third, son, sam, after, the, champion, of, the, pishdadian, shah, manuchehr, and, ancestor, of, the, celebrated, warrior, hero, rostam, his, youngest, son, bahram, after, the, sasanian, shah, bahram, v, r, 420, 438, famous, for, his, romantic, life, and, hunting, feats, ismail, s, expertise, in, persian, poetic, tales, such, as, the, shahnameh, helped, him, to, represent, himself, as, the, heir, to, the, iranian, model, of, kingship, according, to, the, modern, historian, abbas, amanat, ismail, was, motivated, to, visualize, himself, as, a, shah, of, the, shahnameh, possibly, kaykhosrow, the, archetype, of, a, great, iranian, king, and, the, person, who, overcame, the, turanian, king, afrasiyab, the, nemesis, of, iran, from, an, iranian, perspective, afrasiyab, s, kingdom, of, turan, was, commonly, identified, with, the, land, of, the, turks, in, particular, with, the, uzbek, khanate, of, bukhara, in, central, asia, after, ismail, defeated, the, uzbeks, his, victory, was, portrayed, in, safavid, records, as, a, victory, over, the, mythological, turanians, however, this, fondness, of, iranian, legends, was, not, only, restricted, to, that, of, ismail, and, safavid, iran, both, muhammad, shaybani, selim, i, and, later, babur, and, his, mughal, progeny, all, associated, themselves, with, these, legends, regardless, of, its, increasing, differences, western, central, and, south, asia, all, followed, a, common, persianate, model, of, culture, and, kingship, before, his, defeat, at, chaldiran, in, 1514, ismail, not, only, identified, himself, as, the, reincarnation, of, alid, figures, such, as, ali, and, husayn, but, also, as, the, personification, of, the, divine, light, of, investiture, farr, that, had, radiated, in, the, ancient, iranian, shahs, darius, khosrow, i, anushirvan, r, 531, 579, shapur, i, r, 240, 270, since, the, era, of, the, achaemenids, and, sasanians, this, was, a, typical, safavid, combination, of, islamic, and, pre, islamic, iranian, motifs, the, safavids, also, included, and, promoted, turkic, and, mongol, aspects, from, the, central, asian, steppe, such, as, giving, high, ranking, positions, to, turkic, leaders, and, utilizing, turkic, tribal, clans, for, their, aspirations, in, war, they, likewise, included, turco, mongolian, titles, such, as, khan, and, bahadur, to, their, growing, collection, of, titles, the, cultural, aspects, of, the, safavids, soon, became, even, more, numerous, as, ismail, and, his, successors, included, and, promoted, kurds, arabs, georgians, circassians, and, armenians, into, their, imperial, program, moreover, the, conquests, of, genghis, khan, and, timur, had, merged, mongolian, and, chagatai, aspects, into, the, persian, bureaucratic, culture, terminology, seals, and, symbols, ismail, is, also, known, for, his, poetry, using, the, pen, name, kha, arabic, lit, the, wrongful, he, wrote, in, the, turkish, of, safavid, iran, and, persian, although, his, extant, verses, in, the, former, vastly, outnumber, the, latter, the, turkoman, turkish, spoken, in, iran, which, was, commonly, known, as, turki, was, not, the, turkish, of, istanbul, but, a, sort, of, precursor, i, e, proto, form, of, modern, day, azerbaijani, or, azeri, turkic, see, also, ajem, turkic, vladimir, minorsky, characterized, ismail, s, divan, as, written, in, a, southern, turkish, turcoman, dialect, directly, associated, with, the, so, called, zarb, yj, n, turkish, and, noted, that, his, turkish, already, shows, traces, of, decomposition, due, to, the, influence, of, the, iranian, milieu, minorsky, also, added, that, chaghatai, words, are, found, as, well, as, other, words, and, forms, of, unknown, origin, in, ismail, i, s, poems, stephen, dale, describes, the, language, used, by, ismail, in, his, well, known, propagandistic, verse, directed, at, the, turkoman, tribesmen, in, azerbaijan, and, eastern, anatolia, as, the, same, precursor, of, azeri, turkish, i, e, proto, azeri, that, he, was, able, to, converse, in, ismail, is, considered, an, important, figure, in, the, literary, history, of, azerbaijani, language, according, to, encyclop, dia, iranica, ismail, was, a, skillful, poet, who, used, prevalent, themes, and, images, in, lyric, and, didactic, religious, poetry, with, ease, and, some, degree, of, originality, he, was, also, deeply, influenced, by, the, persian, literary, tradition, of, iran, particularly, by, the, shahnameh, of, ferdowsi, which, probably, explains, the, fact, that, he, named, all, of, his, sons, after, shahnameh, characters, dickson, and, welch, suggest, that, ismail, s, sh, hn, maye, sh, h, was, intended, as, a, present, to, his, young, son, tahmasp, after, defeating, muhammad, shaybani, s, uzbeks, ismail, asked, hatefi, a, famous, poet, from, jam, khorasan, to, write, a, shahnameh, like, epic, about, his, victories, and, his, newly, established, dynasty, although, the, epic, was, left, unfinished, it, was, an, example, of, mathnawis, in, the, heroic, style, of, the, shahnameh, written, later, on, for, the, safavid, kings, most, of, the, poems, are, concerned, with, love, particularly, of, the, mystical, sufi, kind, though, there, are, also, poems, propagating, shi, i, doctrine, and, safavi, politics, his, other,
