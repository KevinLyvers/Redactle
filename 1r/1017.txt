young, loyal, supporters, from, ordinary, backgrounds, and, promoted, them, to, middle, level, positions, in, order, to, infiltrate, executive, ranks, in, the, government, these, newly, established, officials, known, as, the, insider, court, took, orders, and, reported, directly, to, emperor, wu, they, had, real, influence, over, the, operation, of, government, affairs, though, lower, in, rank, they, became, a, powerful, counter, against, the, outsider, court, made, up, of, the, three, lords, and, nine, ministers, that, at, the, time, were, mostly, composed, of, anti, reformists, furthermore, emperor, wu, sent, out, nationwide, edicts, appealing, to, grassroots, scholars, such, as, gongsun, hong, to, enrol, in, government, services, in, an, attempt, to, break, the, stranglehold, that, the, older, generation, noble, class, had, on, the, nation, s, levers, of, power, in, 138, bc, the, southern, autonomous, state, of, minyue, in, modern, day, fujian, invaded, the,

court, after, a, heated, court, debate, over, whether, to, offer, military, intervention, for, such, a, distant, vassal, state, emperor, wu, dispatched, a, newly, promoted, official, yan, zhu, to, kuaiji, then, still, located, in, suzhou, rather, than, shaoxing, to, mobilize, the, local, garrison, however, the, tiger, tally, which, was, needed, to, authorize, any, use, of, armed, forces, was, in, grand, empress, dowager, dou, s, possession, at, the, time, yan, zhu, as, the, appointed, imperial, ambassador, circumvented, this, problem, by, executing, a, local, army, commander, who, refused, to, obey, any, order, without, seeing, the, tiger, tally, and, coerced, the, governor, of, kuaiji, to, mobilize, a, large, naval, fleet, to, dong, ou, s, rescue, seeing, that, superior, han, forces, were, on, the, way, minyue, forces, became, fearful, and, retreated, this, was, a, huge, political, victory, for, emperor, wu, and, set, the, precedent, of, using, the, emperor, s, decrees, to, bypass, the, tiger, tally, removing, the, need, for, cooperation, from, his, grandmother, of, course, this, did, not, mean, that, grand, empress, dowager, dou, s, influence, and, intervention, would, disappear, she, was, a, serious, and, insurmountable, obstacle, and, competing, authority, in, administration, for, emperor, wu, until, the, end, of, her, life, but, now, with, the, military, firmly, in, his, control, emperor, wu, s, political, survival, was, assured, and, his, grandmother, or, anyone, else, could, no, longer, threaten, to, dethrone, him, as, directly, easily, and, quickly, as, before, in, the, same, year, emperor, wu, s, newly, favoured, concubine, wei, zifu, became, pregnant, with, his, first, child, effectively, clearing, his, name, and, silencing, any, political, enemies, who, had, schemed, to, use, his, alleged, infertility, as, an, excuse, to, have, him, removed, when, this, news, reached, the, state, of, huainan, liu, an, who, was, hoping, the, young, emperor, wu, s, infertility, would, allow, him, to, ascend, to, the, throne, went, into, a, state, of, denial, and, rewarded, anyone, who, told, him, that, emperor, wu, was, still, childless, in, 135, bc, grand, empress, dowager, dou, died, removing, the, last, major, obstacle, against, emperor, wu, s, ambition, for, reform, after, the, death, of, grand, empress, dowager, dou, in, 135, bc, emperor, wu, had, full, and, unrivaled, control, of, the, government, while, his, mother, empress, dowager, wang, and, his, uncle, tian, fen, were, still, heavily, influential, they, also, benefited, from, the, death, of, the, old, woman, especially, the, mother, of, emperor, wu, but, they, lacked, the, ability, to, restrain, the, emperor, s, actions, emperor, wu, began, military, campaigns, focused,

general, yang, pu, emperor, wu, rejected, a, military, solution, and, the, han, forces, arrived, home, without, attacking, dongyue, though, border, garrisons, were, told, to, prepare, for, any, military, conflicts, after, king, yushan, was, informed, of, this, he, became, overly, confident, and, proud, and, responded, by, revolting, against, the, han, proclaiming, himself, emperor, and, assigned, his, han, devouring, generals, to, invade, neighbouring, regions, controlled, by, the, han, enraged, emperor, wu, sent, a, combined, army, led, by, generals, han, yue, yang, pu, wang,

king, yushan, before, surrendering, to, the, han, forces, the, two, states, of, minyue, and, dongyue, were, then, completely, annexed, under, the, han, rule, in, 135, bc, when, minyue, attacked, nanyue, nanyue, also, sought, assistance, from, han, even, though, it, probably, had, enough, strength, to, defend, itself, emperor, wu, was, greatly, pleased, by, this, gesture, and, he, dispatched, an, expedition, force, to, attack, minyue, over, the, objection, of, one, of, his, key, advisors, liu, an, a, royal, relative, and, the, prince, of, huainan, minyue, nobles, fearful, of, the, massive,

led, to, the, consolidation, of, the, many, tribes, into, a, confederacy, following, the, end, of, the, chu, han, contention, emperor, gao, of, han, realized, that, the, nation, was, not, yet, strong, enough, to, confront, the, xiongnu, he, therefore, resorted, to, the, so, called, marriage, alliance, or, heqin, in, order, to, ease, hostility, and, buy, time, for, the, nation, to, rest, and,

peace, with, the, battle, of, mayi, in, 133, bc, which, involved, a, failed, plan, to, trick, a, force, of, 30, 000, xiongnu, into, an, ambush, of, 300, 000, han, soldiers, while, neither, side, suffered, any, casualties, the, xiongnu, retaliated, by, increasing, their, border, attacks, leading, many, in, the, han, court, to, abandon, the, hope, for, peace, with, the, xiongnu, the, failure, of, the, mayi, operation, prompted, emperor, wu, to, switch, the, han, army, s, doctrine, from, the, traditionally, more, defensive, chariot, infantry, warfare, to, a, highly, mobile, and, offensive, cavalry, against, cavalry, warfare, at, the, same, time, he, expanded, and, trained, officers, from, his, royal, guards, after, a, series, of, defeats, by, wei, qing, the, half, brother, of, emperor,

territorial, acquisitions, the, han, dynasty, successfully, opened, up, the, northern, silk, road, allowing, direct, access, to, trade, with, central, asia, this, also, provided, a, new, supply, of, high, quality, horse, breeds, from, central, asia, including, the, famed, ferghana, horse, ancestors, of, the, modern, akhal, teke, further, strengthening, the, han, army, emperor, wu, then, reinforced, this, strategic, asset, by, establishing, five, commanderies, and, constructing, a, length, of, fortified, wall, along, the, border, of, the, hexi, corridor, colonizing, the, area, with, 700, 000, chinese, soldier, settlers, the, battle, of, mobei, 119, bc, saw, han, forces, invade, the, northern, regions, of, the, gobi, desert, the, two, generals, led, the, campaign, to, the, khangai, mountains, where, they, forced, the, chanyu, to, flee, north, of, the, gobi, desert, and, then, out, of, the, gobi, desert, the, xiongnu, destabilized, and, worried, about, further, han, attacks, retreated, further, north, into, the, siberian, regions, where, they, suffered, starvation, due, to, livestock, loss, from, harsh, climates, the, battle, was, however, also, costly, for, the, han, forces, which, lost, almost, 80, of, their, warhorses, the, cost, of, the, war, led, the, central, han, government, to, introduce, new, levies, increasing, the, burden, on, average, peasants, and, the, population, census, of, the, empire, showed, a, significant, drop, from, famines, and, people, fleeing, to, avoid, having, to, pay, the, taxes, emperor, wu, carried, out, an, invasion, of, the, northern, korean, peninsula, and, established, the, commandery, of, canghai, but, abandoned, it, in, 126, bc, some, of, the, military, colonies, established, at, that, time, survived, into, the, 4th, century, leaving, behind, various, particularly, well, preserved, funerary, artefacts, after, the, conquest, of, nanyue, in, 111, bc, emperor, wu, launched, a, second, invasion, of, the, korean, peninsula, and, by, 108, bc, completed, the, han, conquest, of, gojoseon, in, what, is, now, present, day, north, korea, and, manchuria, han, chinese, colonists, in, the, xuantu, and, lelang, commanderies, of, northern, korea, would, later, fight, against, frequent, raids, by, the, goguryeo, and, buyeo, kingdoms, however, they, would, engage, in, mostly, peaceful, trade, relations, with, surrounding, korean, peoples, over, the, centuries, the, latter, of, whom, became, gradually, and, significantly, influenced, by, chinese, culture, the, exploration, into, xiyu, was, first, started, in, 139, bc, when, emperor, wu, commissioned, zhang, qian, to, seek, out, the, kingdom, of, yuezhi, which, had, been, expelled, by, xiongnu, from, the, modern, gansu, region, zhang, was, to, entice, the, kingdom, to, return, to, its, ancestral, lands, with, promises, of, han, military, assistance, with, the, intention, that, yuezhi, forces, would, fight, against, the, xiongnu, zhang, was, immediately, captured, by, xiongnu, once, he, ventured, into, the, desert, but, was, able, to, escape, around, 129, bc, and, eventually, made, it, to, yuezhi, which, by, then, had, relocated, to, samarkand, while, yuezhi, refused, to, return, it, and, several, other, kingdoms, in, the, area, including, dayuan, kokand, and, kangju, established, diplomatic, relations, with, han, zhang, was, able, to, deliver, his, report, to, emperor, wu, when, he, arrived, back, in, the, capital, chang, an, in, 126, bc, after, a, second, and, shorter, captivity, by, xiongnu, after, the, prince, of, hunxie, surrendered, the, gansu, region, the, path, to, xiyu, became, clear, and, regular, embassies, between, han, and, the, xiyu, kingdoms, commenced, another, expansion, plan, this, one, aimed, at, the, south, west, was, aimed, at, the, eventual, conquest, of, nanyue, which, was, viewed, as, an, unreliable, vassal, the, plan, was, to, first, obtain, submission, of, the, south, western, tribal, kingdoms, the, largest, of, which, was, yelang, modern, zunyi, guizhou, so, that, a, route, for, a, potential, back, stabbing, attack, on, nanyue, could, be, made, the, han, ambassador, tang, meng, was, able, to, secure, the, submission, of, these, tribal, kingdoms, by, giving, their, kings, gifts, emperor, wu, established, the, commandery, of, jianwei, headquarters, in, modern, yibin, sichuan, to, govern, over, the, tribes, but, eventually, abandoned, it, after, being, unable, to, cope, with, local, revolts, later, after, zhang, qian, returned, from, the, western, region, part, of, his, report, indicated, that, embassies, could, more, easily, reach, shendu, india, and, anxi, parthia, by, going, through, the, south, western, kingdoms, encouraged, by, the, report, emperor, wu, sent, ambassadors, in, 122, bc, to, try, to, persuade, yelang, and, dian, modern, eastern, yunnan, into, submission, again, han, gaozu, founder, of, the, han, dynasty, had, installed, shaman, cultists, from, the, area, of, the, former, state, of, jin, in, the, area, of, the, modern, province, of, shanxi, as, official, religious, functionaries, of, his, new, empire, emperor, wu, worshiped, the, divinity, tai, yi, or, dong, huang, tai, yi, a, deity, to, whom, he, was, introduced, by, his, shaman, advisers, who, were, able, to, provide, him, with, the, experience, of, having, this, god, and, other, spiritual, entities, such, as, the, master, of, fate, si, ming, summoned, into, his, presence, the, emperor, even, went, so, far, as, to, construct, a, house, of, life, shou, gong, chapel, at, his, ganquan, palace, complex, in, modern, xianyang, shaanxi, specifically, for, this, purpose, in, 118, bc, one, of, the, religious, rituals, that, emperor, wu, organized, was, the, suburban, sacrifice, and, the, nineteen, hymns, entitled, hymns, for, use, in, the, suburban, sacrifice, were, written, in, connection, with, these, religious, rites, and, published, during, wu, s, reign, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, emperor, wu, began, to, show, a, fascination, with, immortality, he, began, to, associate, with, magicians, who, claimed, to, be, able, to, if, they, could, find, the, proper, ingredients, create, divine, pills, that, would, confer, immortality, however, he, himself, punished, others, use, of, magic, severely, in, 130, bc, for, example, when, the, witch, chu, fu, tried, to, approach, empress, chen, to, teach, her, sorcery, and, love, spells, to, curse, consort, wei, and, regain, emperor, wu, s, affections, he, dispatched, zhang, tang, to, execute, chu, fu, for, witchcraft, which, was, illegal, at, the, time, around, the, same, time, perhaps, as, a, sign, of, what, would, come, to, be, emperor, wu, began, to, trust, governing, officials, who, were, harsh, in, their, punishment, believing, that, such, harshness, would, be, the, most, effective, method, to, maintain, social, order, and, so, placing, these, officials, in, power, for, example, one, such, official, yi, zong, became, the, governor, of, the, commandery, of, dingxiang, part, of, modern, hohhot, inner, mongolia, and, executed, 200, prisoners, even, though, they, had, not, committed, capital, crimes, he, then, executed, their, friends, who, happened, to, have, been, visiting, in, 122, bc, liu, an, the, prince, of, huainan, a, previously, trusted, adviser, of, emperor, wu, and, closely, enough, related, to, have, imperial, pretensions, and, his, brother, liu, ci, the, prince, of, hengshan, were, accused, of, plotting, treason, they, committed, suicide, their, families, and, many, alleged, co, conspirators, were, executed, similar, action, was, taken, against, the, other, vassal, princes, and, by, the, end, of, the, reign, all, the, vassal, kingdoms, had, been, political, and, militarily, disabled, a, famous, wrongful, execution, happened, in, 117, bc, when, the, minister, of, agriculture, yan, yi, was, falsely, accused, of, committing, a, crime, though, he, was, actually, targeted, because, he, had, previously, offended, the, emperor, by, opposing, a, plan, to, effectively, extort, double, tributes, out, of, princes, and, marquesses, yan, was, executed, for, internal, defamation, of, the, emperor, and, this, caused, the, officials, to, be, fearful, and, willing, to, flatter, the, emperor, starting, about, 113, bc, emperor, wu, began, to, display, further, signs, of, abusing, his, power, he, began, to, incessantly, tour, the, commanderies, initially, nearby, chang, an, but, later, extending, to, much, farther, places, worshipping, the, various, gods, on, the, way, perhaps, again, in, search, of, immortality, he, also, had, a, succession, of, magicians, whom, he, honoured, with, great, things, in, one, case, he, even, made, one, a, marquess, and, married, his, daughter, the, eldest, princess, wei, to, him, that, magician, luan, da, was, later, exposed, as, a, fraud, and, executed, emperor, wu, s, expenditures, on, these, tours, and, magical, adventures, put, a, great, strain, on, the, national, treasury, and, caused, difficulties, on, the, locales, that, he, visited, twice, causing, the, governors, of, commanderies, to, commit, suicide, after, they, were, unable, to, supply, the, emperor, s, entire, train, in, 112, bc, a, crisis, in, the, kingdom, of, nanyue, modern, guangdong, guangxi, and, northern, vietnam, erupted, leading, to, military, intervention, at, that, time, the, king, zhao, xing, and, his, mother, queen, dowager, jiu, a, chinese, woman, whom, zhao, xing, s, father, zhao, yingqi, had, married, while, he, served, as, an, ambassador, to, han, were, both, in, favor, of, becoming, incorporated, into, han, this, was, opposed, by, the, senior, prime, minister, l, jia, who, wanted, to, maintain, the, kingdom, s, independence, queen, dowager, jiu, tried, to, goad, the, chinese, ambassadors, into, killing, l, but, the, chinese, ambassadors, were, hesitant, to, do, so, when, emperor, wu, sent, a, 2, 000, man, force, led, by, han, qianqiu, and, queen, dowager, jiu, s, brother, jiu, le, to, try, to, assist, the, king, and, the, queen, dowager, l, staged, a, coup, d, tat, and, had, the, king, and, the, queen, dowager, killed, l, then, made, another, son, of, zhao, yingqi, zhao, jiande, king, and, went, on, to, annihilate, the, han, forces, under, han, and, jiu, several, months, later, emperor, wu, commissioned, a, five, pronged, attack, against, nanyue, in, 111, bc, the, han, forces, captured, the, nanyue, capital, panyu, modern, guangzhou, and, annexed, the, entire, nanyue, territory, into, han, establishing, ten, commanderies, that, same, year, one, of, the, co, kings, of, minyue, modern, fujian, luo, yushan, was, fearful, that, han, would, attack, his, kingdom, next, and, made, a, pre, emptive, attack, against, han, capturing, a, number, of, towns, in, former, nanyue, and, in, the, other, border, commanderies, in, 110, bc, under, han, military, pressure, luo, yushan, s, co, king, luo, jugu, assassinated, him, and, surrendered, the, kingdom, to, han, however, emperor, wu, did, not, establish, commanderies, in, minyue, s, former, territory, instead, he, moved, its, people, to, the, region, between, the, yangtze, and, huai, rivers, later, that, year, emperor, wu, at, great, expense, carried, out, the, ancient, ceremony, of, the, feng, and, shan, sacrifices, fengshan, at, mount, tai, this, involved, the, worship, of, heaven, and, earth, and, presumably, a, secret, petition, to, the, gods, of, heaven, and, earth, to, seek, immortality, he, then, decreed, that, he, would, return, to, mount, tai, every, five, years, to, repeat, the, ceremony, but, only, did, so, once, in, 98, bc, many, palaces, were, built, for, him, and, the, princes, to, accommodate, the, anticipated, cycles, of, the, ceremony, it, was, around, this, time, that, in, reaction, to, the, large, expenditures, by, emperor, wu, that, had, exhausted, the, national, treasury, his, agricultural, minister, sang, hongyang, conceived, of, a, plan, that, many, dynasties, would, repeat, later, creating, national, monopolies, for, salt, and, iron, the, national, treasury, would, further, purchase, other, consumer, goods, when, the, prices, were, low, and, sell, them, when, the, prices, were, high, at, profit, thus, replenishing, the, treasury, while, at, the, same, time, making, sure, the, price, fluctuation, would, not, be, too, great, in, 109, bc, emperor, wu, started, yet, another, territorial, expansion, campaign, nearly, a, century, earlier, a, chinese, general, named, wiman, had, taken, the, throne, of, gojoseon, and, had, established, wiman, joseon, at, wanggeom, seong, modern, pyongyang, which, became, a, nominal, han, vassal, when, wiman, s, grandson, king, ugeo, refused, to, permit, jin, s, ambassadors, to, reach, china, through, his, territories, emperor, wei, sent, an, ambassador, she, he, to, wanggeom, to, negotiate, a, right, of, passage, with, king, ugeo, but, king, ugeo, refused, and, had, a, general, escort, she, back, to, han, territory, when, they, got, close, to, han, borders, she, assassinated, the, general, and, claimed, to, emperor, wu, that, he, had, defeated, joseon, in, battle, emperor, wu, unaware, of, his, deception, made, him, the, military, commander, of, the, commandery, of, liaodong, modern, central, liaoning,

xiongnu, soldiers, emperor, wu, had, li, s, clan, executed, moreover, emperor, wu, already, bore, a, grudge, against, the, famed, historian, sima, qian, because, sima, s, shiji, was, not, as, flattering, to, emperor, wu, and, his, father, emperor, jing, as, emperor, wu, wanted, so, emperor, wu, had, sima, qian, castrated, in, 106, bc, in, order, to, further, better, organize, the, territories, including, both, the, previously, existing, empire, and, the, newly, conquered, territories, emperor, wu, divided, the, empire, into, 13, prefectures, zhou, but, without, governors, or,

100, bc, due, to, the, heavy, taxation, and, military, burdens, imposed, by, emperor, wu, s, incessant, military, campaigns, and, luxurious, spending, there, were, many, peasant, revolts, throughout, the, empire, emperor, wu, issued, an, edict, that, was, intended, to, suppress, the, peasant, revolts, he, made, officials, whose, commanderies, saw, unsuppressed, peasant, revolts, liable, with, their, lives, however, this, edict, had, the, exact, opposite, effect, since, it, became, impossible, to, suppress, all, of, the, revolts, officials, would, merely, cover, up, the, existence, of, the, revolts, he, executed, many, people, who, made, fake, coins, in, 96, bc, a, series, of, witchcraft, persecutions, began, emperor, wu, who, was, paranoid, over, a, nightmare, of, being, whipped, by, tiny, stick, wielding, puppets, and, a, sighting, of, a, traceless, assassin, possibly, a, hallucination, ordered, extensive, investigations, with, harsh, punishments, large, numbers, of, people, many, of, them, high, officials, were, accused, of, witchcraft, and, executed, usually, along, with, their, entire, clans, the, first, trial, began, with, empress, wei, zifu, s, elder, brother, in, law, gongsun, he, the, prime, minister, at, the, time, and, his, son, gongsun, jingsheng, also, an, imperial, official, but, arrested, under, corruption, charges, quickly, leading, to, the, execution, of, their, entire, clan, also, caught, in, this, disaster, were, crown, prince, ju, s, two, elder, sisters, princess, yangshi, who, was, said, to, have, a, romantic, relationship, with, her, cousin, gongsun, jingsheng, and, princess, zhuyi, as, well, as, his, cousin, wei, kang, the, eldest, son, of, the, deceased, general, wei, qing, who, were, all, accused, of, witchcraft, and, executed, in, 91, bc, these, witchcraft, persecutions, later, became, intertwined, in, succession, struggles, and, erupted, into, a, major, catastrophe, in, 94, bc, emperor, wu, s, youngest, son, liu, fuling, was, born, to, a, favorite, concubine, of, his, lady, gouyi, consort, zhao, emperor, wu, was, ecstatic, in, having, a, child, at, such, an, advanced, age, 62, years, old, and, because, consort, zhao, purportedly, had, a, pregnancy, that, lasted, 14, months, the, same, as, the, mythical, emperor, yao, he, named, consort, zhao, s, palace, gate, gate, of, yao, s, mother, this, led, to, speculation, that, the, emperor, due, to, his, favor, of, consort, zhao, and, prince, fuling, wanted, to, make, liu, fuling, the, crown, prince, instead, while, there, was, no, evidence, that, he, actually, intended, to, do, anything, as, such, over, the, next, few, years, conspiracies, against, crown, prince, ju, and, his, mother, empress, wei, arose, that, were, inspired, by, such, rumors, up, to, this, point, there, had, been, a, cordial, but, somehow, fragile, relationship, between, emperor, wu, and, his, crown, prince, who, perhaps, was, not, as, ambitious, as, his, father, wished, as, he, grew, older, the, emperor, came, to, be, less, attracted, to, ju, s, mother, empress, wei, zifu, though, he, continued, to, respect, her, and, she, had, such, absolute, power, over, palace, affairs, that, emperor, wu, did, not, ask, for, any, report, from, empress, wei, contrary, to, the, custom, and, law, that, emperors, asked, empresses, to, report, on, important, actions, regarding, the, house, and, the, royal, family, once, every, five, days, when, he, left, the, capital, the, emperor, would, delegate, authority, to, crown, prince, ju, eventually, however, the, two, began, to, have, disagreements, over, policy, with, ju, favoring, leniency, and, wu, s, advisers, harsh, and, sometimes, corrupt, officials, urging, the, opposite, after, wei, qing, s, death, in, 106, bc, and, gongsun, he, s, execution, prince, ju, had, no, strong, allies, left, in, the, government, the, other, officials, then, began, to, publicly, defame, and, plot, against, him, meanwhile, emperor, wu, was, becoming, more, and, more, isolated, spending, time, with, young, concubines, often, remaining, unavailable, to, ju, or, wei, conspirators, against, prince, ju, included, jiang, chong, the, newly, appointed, head, of, secret, intelligence, who, had, once, had, a, run, in, with, ju, after, arresting, one, of, his, assistants, for, improper, use, of, an, imperial, right, of, way, another, conspirator, was, su, wen, chief, eunuch, in, charge, of, caring, for, imperial, concubines, who, had, previously, made, false, accusations, against, ju, claiming, he, was, joyful, over, wu, s, illness, and, had, an, adulterous, relationship, with, one, of, the, junior, concubines, jiang, and, others, made, many, accusations, of, witchcraft, against, important, people, in, the, han, court, jiang, and, su, decided, to, use, witchcraft, as, the, excuse, to, move, against, prince, ju, himself, with, approval, from, emperor, wu, who, was, then, at, the, ganquan, palace, jiang, searched, through, various, palaces, ostensibly, for, witchcraft, items, eventually, reaching, prince, ju, s, and, empress, wei, s, palace, while, completely, trashing, the, palaces, up, with, intensive, digging, he, secretly, planted, witchery, dolls, and, pieces, of, cloth, with, mysterious, writings, he, then, announced, that, he, had, found, the, items, there, during, the, search, prince, ju, was,

during, his, reign, and, much, of, the, territory, that, he, annexed, is, now, part, of, modern, china, he, officially, encouraged, confucianism, yet, just, like, qin, shi, huang, he, personally,

close, advisor, and, it, stayed, this, way, until, the, end, of, the, imperial, era, in, 140, bc, emperor, wu, conducted, an, imperial, examination, of, over, 100, young, scholars, having, been, recommended, by, officials, most, of, the, scholars, were, commoners, with, no, noble, background, this, event, would, have, a, major, impact, on, chinese, history, marking, the, official, start, of, the, establishment, of, confucianism, as, official, imperial, doctrine, this, came, about, because, a, young, confucian, scholar, dong, zhongshu, was, evaluated, to, have, submitted, the, best, essay, in, which, he, advocated, the, establishment, of, confucianism, it, is, unclear, whether, emperor, wu, in, his, young, age, actually, determined, this, or, whether, this, was, the, result, of, machinations, of, the, prime, minister, wei, wan, who, was, himself, a, confucian, however, the, fact, that, several, other, young, scholars, who, scored, highly, on, the, examination, but, not, dong, later, became, trusted, advisors, for, emperor, wu, would, appear, to, suggest, that, emperor, wu, himself, at, least, had, some, actual, participation, in, 136, bc, emperor, wu, founded, what, became, the, imperial, university, a, college, for, classical, scholars, that, supplied, the, han, s, need, for, well, trained, bureaucrats, various, important, aspects, of, han, poetry, are, associated, with, emperor, wu, and, his, court, including, his, direct, interest, in, poetry, and, patronage, of, poets, emperor, wu, was, also, a, patron, of, literature, with, a, number, of, poems, being, attributed, to, him, as, to, the, poetry, on, lost, love, some, of, the, pieces, attributed, to, him, are, considered, of, well, done, there, is, some, question, to, their, actual, authorship, the, following, work, is, on, the, death, of, one, of, his, concubines, the, sound, of, her, silk, skirt, has, stopped, on, the, marble, pavement, dust, grows, her, empty, room, is, cold, and, still, fallen, leaves, are, piled, against, the, doors, how, can, i, bring, my, aching, heart, to, rest, emperor, wu, facilitated, a, revival, of, interest, in, chu, ci, the, poetry, of, and, in, the, style, of, the, area, of, the, former, chu, kingdom, during, the, early, part, of, his, reign, in, part, because, of, his, near, relative, liu, an, some, of, this, chu, material, was, later, anthologized, in, the, chu, ci, the, chuci, genre, of, poetry, from, its, origin, was, linked, with, chu, shamanism, and, han, wudi, both, supported, the, chu, genre, of, poetry, in, the, earlier, years, of, his, reign, and, also, continued, to, support, shamanically, linked, poetry, during, the, later, years, of, his, reign, emperor, wu, employed, poets, and, musicians, in, writing, lyrics, and, scoring, tunes, for, various, performances, and, also, patronized, choreographers, and, shamans, in, this, same, connection, for, arranging, the, dance, movements, and, coordinating, the, spiritual, and, the, mundane, he, was, quite, fond, of, the, resulting, lavish, ritual, performances, especially, night, time, rituals, where, the, multitudinous, singers, musicians, and, dancers, would, perform, in, the, brilliant, lighting, provided, by, of, thousands, of, torches, the, fu, style, typical, of, han, poetry, also, took, shape, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, in, his, court, with, poet, and, official, sima, xiangru, as, a, leading, figure, however, sima, s, initial, interest, in, the, chu, ci, style, later, gave, way, to, his, interest, in, more, innovative, forms, of, poetry, after, his, patronage, of, poets, familiar, with, the, chu, ci, style, in, the, early, part, of, his, reign, emperor, wu, later, seems, to, have, turned, his, interest, and, his, court, s, interest, to, other, literary, fashions, another, of, emperor, wu, s, major, contribution, to, poetry, was, through, his, organization, of, the, imperial, music, bureau, yuefu, as, part, of, the, official, governmental, bureaucratic, apparatus, the, music, bureau, was, charged, with, matters, related, to, music, and, poetry, as, lyrics, are, a, part, of, music, and, traditional, chinese, poetry, was, considered, to, have, been, chanted, or, sung, rather, than, spoken, or, recited, as, prose, the, music, bureau, greatly, flourished, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, of, han, who, has, been, widely, cited, to, have, founded, the, music, bureau, in, 120, bce, however, it, seems, more, likely, that, there, was, already, a, long, standing, office, of, music, and, that, emperor, wu, enlarged, its, size, as, part, of, his, governmental, reorganization, changing, its, scope, and, function, and, possibly, renaming, it, and, thus, seeming, to, have, established, a, new, institution, the, stated, tasks, of, this, institution, were, apparently, to, collect, popular, songs, from, different, and, adapt, and, orchestrate, these, as, well, as, to, develop, new, material, emperor, wu, s, music, bureau, not, only, collected, folk, songs, and, ballads, from, where, they, originated, throughout, the, country, but, also, collected, songs, reportedly, based, on, central, asian, tunes, or, melodies, with, new, lyrics, which, were, written, to, harmonize, with, the, existing, tunes, and, characterized, by, varying, line, lengths, and, the, incorporation, of, various, nonce, words, in, any, case, he, is, widely, held, to, have, used, the, music, bureau, as, an, important, part, of, his, religious, innovations, and, to, have, specifically, commissioned, sima, xiangru, to, write, poetry, because, of, the, development, and, transmission, of, a, particular, style, of, poetry, by, the, music, bureau, this, style, of, poetry, has, become, known, as, the, music, bureau, style, or, yuefu, and, also, in, its, later, development, referred, to, as, new, yuefu, imitation, or, literary, y, eh, fu, consorts, and, issue, emperor, wu, is, one, of, the, most, famous, emperors, of, ancient, china, and, has,
