at, the, detroit, railway, station, though, those, with, him, did, not, on, february, 11, 1937, he, performed, his, piano, concerto, in, f, in, a, special, concert, of, his, music, with, the, san,

tumor, leonore, called, george, s, close, friend, emil, mosbacher, and, explained, the, dire, need, to, find, a, neurosurgeon, mosbacher, immediately, called, pioneering, neurosurgeon, harvey, cushing, in, boston, who, retired, for, several, years, by, then, recommended, walter, dandy, who, was, on, a, boat, fishing, in, the, chesapeake, bay, with, harry, nice, the, governor, of, maryland, mosbacher, called, the, white, house, and, had, a, coast, guard, cutter, sent, to, find, the, governor, s, yacht, and, bring, dandy, quickly, to, shore, mosbacher, then, chartered, a, plane, and, flew, dandy, to, newark, airport, where, he, was, to, catch, a, plane, to, los, angeles, by, that, time, gershwin, s, condition, was, critical, and, the, need, for, surgery, was, immediate, before, dandy, could, arrive, in, the, early, hours, of, sunday, july, 11, 1937, doctors, at, cedars, removed, a, large, brain, tumor, believed, to, have, been, a, glioblastoma, but, gershwin, died, that, morning, at, the, age, of, 38, the, fact, that, he, had, suddenly, collapsed, and, become, comatose, after, he, stood, up, on, july, 9, has, been, interpreted, as, brain, herniation, with, duret, hemorrhages, gershwin, s, friends, and, admirers, were, shocked, and, devastated, john, o, hara, remarked, george, gershwin, died, on, july, 11, 1937, but, i, don, t, have, to, believe, that, if, i, don, t, want, to, he, was, interred, at, westchester, hills, cemetery, in, hastings, on, hudson, new, york, a, memorial, concert, was, held, at, the, hollywood, bowl, on, september, 8, 1937, at, which, otto, klemperer, conducted, his, own, orchestration, of, the, second, of, gershwin, s, three, preludes, gershwin, was, influenced, by, french, composers, of, the, early, twentieth, century, in, turn, maurice, ravel, was, impressed, with, gershwin, s, abilities, commenting, personally, i, find, jazz, most, interesting, the, rhythms, the, way, the, melodies, are, handled, the, melodies, themselves, i, have, heard, of, george, gershwin, s, works, and, i, find, them, intriguing, the, orchestrations, in, gershwin, s, symphonic, works, often, seem, similar, to, those, of, ravel, likewise, ravel, s, two, piano, concertos, evince, an, influence, of, gershwin, george, gershwin, asked, to, study, with, ravel, when, ravel, heard, how, much, gershwin, earned, ravel, replied, with, words, to, the, effect, of, you, should, give, me, lessons, some, versions, of, this, story, feature, igor, stravinsky, rather, than, ravel, as, the, composer, however, stravinsky, confirmed, that, he, originally, heard, the, story, from, ravel, gershwin, s, own, concerto, in, f, was, criticized, for, being, related, to, the, work, of, claude, debussy, more, so, than, to, the, expected, jazz, style, the, comparison, did, not, deter, him, from, continuing, to, explore, french, styles, the, title, of, an, american, in, paris, reflects, the, very, journey, that, he, had, consciously, taken, as, a, composer, the, opening, part, will, be, developed, in, typical, french, style, in, the, manner, of, debussy, and, les, six, though, the, tunes, are, original, gershwin, was, intrigued, by, the, works, of, alban, berg, dmitri, shostakovich, igor, stravinsky, darius, milhaud, and, arnold, schoenberg, he, also, asked, schoenberg, for, composition, lessons, schoenberg, refused, saying, i, would, only, make, you, a, bad, schoenberg, and, you, re, such, a, good, gershwin, already, this, quote, is, similar, to, one, credited, to, maurice, ravel, during, gershwin, s, 1928, visit, to, france, why, be, a, second, rate, ravel, when, you, are, a, first, rate, gershwin, gershwin, was, particularly, impressed, by, the, music, of, berg, who, gave, him, a, score, of, the, lyric, suite, he, attended, the, american, premiere, of, wozzeck, conducted, by, leopold, stokowski, in, 1931, and, was, thrilled, and, deeply, impressed, russian, joseph, schillinger, s, influence, as, gershwin, s, teacher, of, composition, 1932, 1936, was, substantial, in, providing, him, with, a, method, of, composition, there, has, been, some, disagreement, about, the, nature, of, schillinger, s, influence, on, gershwin, after, the, posthumous, success, of, porgy, and, bess, schillinger, claimed, he, had, a, large, and, direct, influence, in, overseeing, the, creation, of, the, opera, ira, completely, denied, that, his, brother, had, any, such, assistance, for, this, work, a, third, account, of, gershwin, s, musical, relationship, with, his, teacher, was, written, by, gershwin, s, close, friend, vernon, duke, also, a, schillinger, student, in, an, article, for, the, musical, quarterly, in, 1947, what, set, gershwin, apart, was, his, ability, to, manipulate, forms, of, music, into, his, own, unique, voice, he, took, the, jazz, he, discovered, on, tin, pan, alley, into, the, mainstream, by, splicing, its, rhythms, and, tonality, with, that, of, the, popular, songs, of, his, era, although, george, gershwin, would, seldom, make, grand, statements, about, his, music, he, believed, that, true, music, must, reflect, the, thought, and, aspirations, of, the, people, and, time, my, people, are, americans, my, time, is, today, in, 2007, the, library, of, congress, named, its, gershwin, prize, for, popular, song, after, george, and, ira, gershwin, recognizing, the, profound, and, positive, effect, of, popular, music, on, culture, the, prize, is, given, annually, to, a, composer, or, performer, whose, lifetime, contributions, exemplify, the, standard, of, excellence, associated, with, the, gershwins, on, march, 1, 2007, the, first, gershwin, prize, was, awarded, to, paul, simon, early, in, his, career, under, both, his, own, name, and, pseudonyms, gershwin, recorded, more, than, one, hundred, forty, player, piano, rolls, which, were, a, main, source, of, his, income, the, majority, were, popular, music, of, the, period, and, a, smaller, proportion, were, of, his, own, works, once, his, musical, theater, writing, income, became, substantial, his, regular, roll, recording, career, became, superfluous, he, did, record, additional, rolls, throughout, the, 1920s, of, his, main, hits, for, the, aeolian, company, s, reproducing, piano, including, a, complete, version, of, his, rhapsody, in, blue, compared, to, the, piano, rolls, there, are, few, accessible, audio, recordings, of, gershwin, s, playing, his, first, recording, was, his, own, swanee, with, the, fred, van, eps, trio, in, 1919, the, recorded, balance, highlights, the, banjo, playing, of, van, eps, and, the, piano, is, overshadowed, the, recording, took, place, before, swanee, became, famous, as, an, al, jolson, specialty, in, early, 1920, gershwin, recorded, an, abridged, version, of, rhapsody, in, blue, with, paul, whiteman, and, his, orchestra, for, the, victor, talking, machine, company, in, 1924, soon, after, the, world, premiere, gershwin, and, the, same, orchestra, made, an, electrical, recording, of, the, abridged, version, for, victor, in, 1927, however, a, dispute, in, the, studio, over, interpretation, angered, whiteman, and, he, walked, out, on, the, session, victor, s, staff, conductor, and, arranger, nathaniel, shilkret, led, the, orchestra, though, whiteman, is, still, credited, as, conductor, on, the, original, record, labels, gershwin, made, a, number, of, solo, piano, recordings, of, tunes, from, his, musicals, some, including, the, vocals, of, fred, and, adele, astaire, as, well, as, his, three, preludes, for, piano, in, 1929, gershwin, supervised, the, world, premiere, recording, of, an, american, in, paris, with, nathaniel, shilkret, and, the, victor, symphony, orchestra, gershwin, s, role, in, the, recording, was, rather, limited, particularly, because, shilkret, was, conducting, and, had, his, own, ideas, about, the, music, when, it, was, realized, that, no, one, had, been, hired, to, play, the, brief, celeste, solo, gershwin, was, asked, if, he, could, and, would, play, the, instrument, and, he, agreed, gershwin, can, be, heard, rather, briefly, on, the, recording, during, the, slow, section, gershwin, also, appeared, on, several, radio, programs, including, rudy, vallee, s, and, played, some, of, his, compositions, this, included, the, third, movement, of, the, concerto, in, f, with, vallee, conducting, the, studio, orchestra, some, of, these, performances, were, preserved, on, transcription, discs, and, have, been, released, on, lp, and, cd, in, 1934, in, an, effort, to, earn, money, to, finance, his, planned, folk, opera, gershwin, hosted, his, own, radio, program, titled, music, by, gershwin, the, show, was, broadcast, on, the, nbc, blue, network, from, february, to, may, and, again, in, september,
