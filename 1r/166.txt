considered, primarily, an, architect, however, as, james, beck, has, observed, to, single, out, one, of, leon, battista, s, fields, over, others, as, somehow, functionally, independent, and, self, sufficient, is, of, no, help, at, all, to, any, effort, to, characterize, alberti, s, extensive, explorations, in, the, fine, arts, although, alberti, is, known, mostly, as, an, artist, he, was, also, a, mathematician, and, made, significant, contributions, to, that, field, among, the, most, famous, buildings, he, designed, are, the, churches, of, san, sebastiano, 1460, and, sant, andrea, 1472,

the, service, of, the, papal, court, during, this, time, he, studied, the, ancient, ruins, which, excited, his, interest, in, architecture, and, strongly, influenced, the, form, of, the, buildings, that, he, designed, leon, battista, alberti, was, gifted, in, many, ways, he, was, tall, strong, and, a, fine, athlete, who, could, ride, the, wildest, horse, and, jump, over, a, person, s, head, he, distinguished, himself, as, a, writer, while, still, a, child, at, school, and, by, the, age, of, twenty, had, written, a, play, that, was, successfully, passed, off, as, a, genuine, piece, of, classical, literature, in, 1435, he, began, his, first, major, written, work, della, pittura, which, was, inspired, by, the, burgeoning, pictorial, art, in, florence, in, the, early, fifteenth, century, in, this, work, he, analysed, the, nature, of, painting, and, explored, the, elements, of, perspective, composition, and, colour, in, 1438, he, began, to, focus, more, on, architecture, and, was, encouraged, by, the, marchese, leonello, d, este, of, ferrara, for, whom, he, built, a, small, triumphal, arch, to, support, an, equestrian, statue, of, leonello, s, father, in, 1447, alberti,

the, rucellai, palace, in, florence, this, was, followed, in, 1450, by, a, commission, from, sigismondo, malatesta, to, transform, the, gothic, church, of, san, francesco, in, rimini, into, a, memorial, chapel, the, tempio, malatestiano, in, florence, he, designed, the, upper, parts, of, the, fa, ade, for, the, dominican, church, of, santa, maria, novella, famously, bridging, the, nave, and, lower, aisles, with, two, ornately, inlaid, scrolls, solving, a, visual, problem, and, setting, a, precedent, to, be, followed, by, architects, of, churches, for, four, hundred, years, in, 1452, he, completed, de, re, aedificatoria, a, treatise, on, architecture, using, as, its, basis, the, work, of, vitruvius, and, influenced, by, the, ancient, roman, buildings, the, work, was, not, published, until, 1485, it, was, followed, in, 1464, by, his, less, influential, work, de, statua, in, which, he, examines, sculpture, alberti, s, only, known, sculpture, is, a, self, portrait, medallion, sometimes, attributed, to, pisanello, alberti, was, employed, to, design, two, churches, in, mantua, san, sebastiano, which, was, never, completed, and, for, which, alberti, s, intention, can, only, be, speculated, upon, and, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, the, design, for, the, latter, church, was, completed, in, 1471, a, year, before, alberti, s, death, the, construction, was, completed, after, his, death, and, is, considered, as, his, most, significant, work, as, an, artist, alberti, distinguished, himself, from, the, contemporary, ordinary, craftsmen, educated, in, workshops, he, was, a, humanist, who, studied, aristotle, and, plotinus, he, was, among, the, rapidly, growing, group, of, intellectuals, and, artists, who, at, that, time, were, supported, by, the, courts, of, nobility, as, a, member, of, a, noble, family, and, as, part, of, the, roman, curia, alberti, enjoyed, special, status, he, was, a, welcomed, guest, at, the, este, court, in, ferrara, and, spent, time, with, the, soldier, prince, federico, iii, da, montefeltro, in, urbino, the, duke, of, urbino, was, a, shrewd, military, commander, who, generously, funded, artists, alberti, planned, to, dedicate, his, treatise, on, architecture, to, him, among, alberti, s, minor, but, pioneering, studies, were, an, essay, on, cryptography, de, componendis, cifris, and, the, first, italian, grammar, he, collaborated, with, the, florentine, cosmographer, paolo, toscanelli, in, astronomy, a, science, close, to, geography, at, that, time, he, also, wrote, a, small, latin, work, on, geography, descriptio, urbis, romae, the, panorama, of, the, city, of, rome, just, a, few, years, before, his, death, alberti, completed, de, iciarchia, on, ruling, the, household, a, dialogue, about, florence, during, the, medici, rule, alberti, took, holy, orders, and, never, married, he, loved, animals, and, had, a, pet, dog, a, mongrel, about, whom, he, wrote, a, panegyric, canis, vasari, describes, alberti, as, an, admirable, citizen, a, man, of, culture, a, friend, of, talented, men, open, and, courteous, with, everyone, he, always, lived, honourably, and, like, the, gentleman, he, was, alberti, died, in, rome, on, 25, april, 1472, at, the, age, of, 68, alberti, considered, mathematics, as, the, foundation, of, arts, and, sciences, to, make, clear, my, exposition, in, writing, this, brief, commentary, on, painting, alberti, began, his, treatise, della, pittura, on, painting, dedicated, to, brunelleschi, i, will, take, first, from, the, mathematicians, those, things, with, which, my, subject, is, concerned, della, pittura, also, known, in, latin, as, de, pictura, relied, on, the, study, classical, optics, to, approach, the, perspective, in, artistic, and, architectural, representations, alberti, was, well, versed, in, the, sciences, of, his, age, his, knowledge, of, optics, was, connected, to, the, tradition, of, the, kitab, al, manazir, the, optics, de, aspectibus, of, the, arab, polymath, alhazen, ibn, al, haytham, d, c, 1041, which, was, transmitted, by, franciscan, optical, workshops, of, the, thirteenth, century, perspectivae, traditions, of, scholars, such, as, roger, bacon, john, peckham, and, witelo, similar, influences, are, also, traceable, in, the, third, commentary, of, lorenzo, ghiberti, commentario, terzo, in, both, della, pittura, and, de, statua, alberti, stressed, that, all, steps, of, learning, should, be, sought, from, nature, the, ultimate, aim, of, an, artist, is, to, imitate, nature, painters, and, sculptors, strive, through, by, different, skills, at, the, same, goal, namely, that, as, nearly, as, possible, the, work, they, have, undertaken, shall, appear, to, the, observer, to, be, similar, to, the, real, objects, of, nature, however, alberti, did, not, mean, that, artists, should, imitate, nature, objectively, as, it, is, but, the, artist, should, be, especially, attentive, to, beauty, for, in, painting, beauty, is, as, pleasing, as, it, is, necessary, the, work, of, art, is, according, to, alberti, so, constructed, that, it, is, impossible, to, take, anything, away, from, it, or, to, add, anything, to, it, without, impairing, the, beauty, of, the, whole, beauty, was, for, alberti, the, harmony, of, all, parts, in, relation, to, one, another, and, subsequently, this, concord, is, realized, in, a, particular, number, proportion, and, arrangement, demanded, by, harmony, alberti, s, thoughts, on, harmony, were, not, new, they, could, be, traced, back, to, pythagoras, but, he, set, them, in, a, fresh, context, which, fit, in, well, with, the, contemporary, aesthetic, discourse, in, rome, alberti, spent, considerable, time, studying, its, ancient, sites, ruins, and, arts, his, detailed, observations, included, in, his, de, re, aedificatoria, 1452, on, the, art, of, building, were, inspired, by, the, essay, de, architectura, written, by, the, roman, architect, and, engineer, vitruvius, fl, 46, 30, bc, alberti, s, work, was, the, first, architectural, treatise, of, the, renaissance, it, covered, a, wide, range, of, subjects, from, history, to, town, planning, from, engineering, to, the, aesthetics, de, re, aedificatoria, a, large, and, expensive, book, was, not, published, until, 1485, after, which, it, became, a, major, reference, for, architects, however, the, book, was, written, not, only, for, craftsmen, but, also, for, anyone, interested, in, the, noble, arts, as, alberti, put, it, originally, published, in, latin, the, first, italian, edition, came, out, in, 1546, and, the, standard, italian, edition, by, cosimo, bartoli, was, published, in, 1550, pope, nicholas, v, to, whom, alberti, dedicated, the, whole, work, dreamed, of, rebuilding, the, city, of, rome, but, he, managed, to, realize, only, a, fragment, of, his, visionary, plans, through, his, book, alberti, opened, up, his, theories, and, ideals, of, the, florentine, renaissance, to, architects, scholars, and, others, alberti, wrote, i, libri, della, famiglia, which, discussed, education, marriage, household, management, and, money, in, the, tuscan, dialect, the, work, was, not, printed, until, 1843, like, erasmus, decades, later, alberti, stressed, the, need, for, a, reform, in, education, he, noted, that, the, care, of, very, young, children, is, women, s, work, for, nurses, or, the, mother, and, that, at, the, earliest, possible, age, children, should, be, taught, the, alphabet, with, great, hopes, he, gave, the, work, to, his, family, to, read, but, in, his, autobiography, alberti, confesses, that, he, could, hardly, avoid, feeling, rage, moreover, when, he, saw, some, of, his, relatives, openly, ridiculing, both, the, whole, work, and, the, author, s, futile, enterprise, along, it, momus, written, between, 1443, and, 1450, was, a, notable, comedy, about, the, olympian, deities, it, has, been, considered, as, a, roman, clef, jupiter, has, been, identified, in, some, sources, as, pope, eugenius, iv, and, pope, nicholas, v, alberti, borrowed, many, of, its, characters, from, lucian, one, of, his, favorite, greek, writers, the, name, of, its, hero, momus, refers, to, the, greek, word, for, blame, or, criticism, after, being, expelled, from, heaven, momus, the, god, of, mockery, is, eventually, castrated, jupiter, and, the, other, deities, come, down, to, earth, also, but, they, return, to, heaven, after, jupiter, breaks, his, nose, in, a, great, storm, alberti, did, not, concern, himself, with, engineering, and, very, few, of, his, major, projects, were, built, as, a, designer, and, a, student, of, vitruvius, and, of, ancient, roman, architecture, he, studied, column, and, lintel, based, architecture, from, a, visual, rather, than, structural, viewpoint, he, correctly, employed, the, classical, orders, unlike, his, contemporary, brunelleschi, who, used, the, classical, column, and, pilaster, in, a, free, interpretation, alberti, reflected, on, the, social, effects, of, architecture, and, was, attentive, to, the, urban, landscape, this, is, demonstrated, by, his, inclusion, at, the, rucellai, palace, of, a, continuous, bench, for, seating, at, the, level, of, the, basement, alberti, anticipated, the, principle, of, street, hierarchy, with, wide, main, streets, connected, to, secondary, streets, and, buildings, of, equal, height, in, rome, he, was, employed, by, pope, nicholas, v, for, the, restoration, of, the, roman, aqueduct, of, acqua, vergine, which, debouched, into, a, simple, basin, designed, by, alberti, which, was, later, replaced, by, the, baroque, trevi, fountain, some, researchers, suggested, that, the, villa, medici, in, fiesole, might, have, been, designed, by, alberti, rather, than, by, michelozzo, this, hilltop, residence, commissioned, by, giovanni, de, medici, cosimo, il, vecchio, s, second, son, with, its, view, over, the, city, is, sometimes, considered, the, first, example, of, a, renaissance, villa, it, reflects, the, writing, by, alberti, about, country, residential, buildings, as, villa, suburbana, the, building, later, inspired, numerous, other, similar, projects, buildings, from, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, the, tempio, malatestiano, in, rimini, 1447, 1453, 60, is, the, rebuilding, of, a, gothic, church, the, fa, ade, with, its, dynamic, play, of, forms, was, left, incomplete, the, design, of, the, fa, ade, of, the, palazzo, rucellai, 1446, 51, was, one, of, several, commissioned, by, the, rucellai, family, the, design, overlays, a, grid, of, shallow, pilasters, and, cornices, in, classical, style, onto, rusticated, masonry, and, is, surmounted, by, a, heavy, cornice, the, inner, courtyard, has, corinthian, columns, the, palace, introduced, set, the, use, of, classical, building, elements, in, civic, buildings, in, florence, and, became, very, influential, the, work, was, executed, by, bernardo, rossellino, at, santa, maria, novella, florence, between, 1448, 70, the, upper, fa, ade, was, constructed, to, the, design, of, alberti, it, was, a, challenging, task, as, the, lower, level, already, had, three, doorways, and, six, gothic, niches, containing, tombs, and, employing, the, polychrome, marble, typical, of, florentine, churches, such, as, san, miniato, al, monte, and, the, baptistery, of, florence, the, design, also, incorporates, an, ocular, window, that, was, already, in, place, alberti, introduced, classical, features, around, the, portico, and, spread, the, polychromy, over, the, entire, fa, ade, in, a, manner, that, includes, classical, proportions, and, elements, such, as, pilasters, cornices, and, a, pediment, in, the, classical, style, ornamented, with, a, sunburst, in, tesserae, rather, than, sculpture, the, best, known, feature, of, this, typically, aisled, church, is, the, manner, in, which, alberti, has, solved, the, problem, of, visually, bridging, the, different, levels, of, the, central, nave, and, much, lower, side, aisles, he, employed, two, large, scrolls, which, were, to, become, a, standard, feature, of, church, fa, ades, in, the, later, renaissance, baroque, and, classical, revival, buildings, alberti, is, considered, to, have, been, the, consultant, for, the, design, of, the, piazza, pio, ii, pienza, the, village, previously, called, corsignano, was, redesigned, beginning, around, 1459, it, was, the, birthplace, of, aeneas, silvius, piccolomini, pope, pius, ii, in, whose, employ, alberti, served, pius, ii, wanted, to, use, the, village, as, a, retreat, but, needed, for, it, to, reflect, the, dignity, of, his, position, the, piazza, is, a, trapezoid, shape, defined, by, four, buildings, with, a, focus, on, pienza, cathedral, and, passages, on, either, side, opening, onto, a, landscape, view, the, principal, residence, palazzo, piccolomini, is, on, the, western, side, it, has, three, stories, articulated, by, pilasters, and, entablature, courses, with, a, twin, lighted, cross, window, set, within, each, bay, this, structure, is, similar, to, alberti, s, palazzo, rucellai, in, florence, and, other, later, palaces, noteworthy, is, the, internal, court, of, the, palazzo, the, back, of, the, palace, to, the, south, is, defined, by, loggia, on, all, three, floors, that, overlook, an, enclosed, italian, renaissance, garden, with, giardino, all, italiana, era, modifications, and, spectacular, views, into, the, distant, landscape, of, the, val, d, orcia, and, pope, pius, s, beloved, mount, amiata, beyond, below, this, garden, is, a, vaulted, stable, that, had, stalls, for, a, hundred, horses, the, design, which, radically, transformed, the, center, of, the, town, included, a, palace, for, the, pope, a, church, a, town, hall, and, a, building, for, the, bishops, who, would, accompany, the, pope, on, his, trips, pienza, is, considered, an, early, example, of, renaissance, urban, planning, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, mantua, was, begun, in, 1471, the, year, before, alberti, s, death, it, was, brought, to, completion, and, is, his, most, significant, work, employing, the, triumphal, arch, motif, both, for, its, fa, ade, and, interior, and, influencing, many, works, that, were, to, follow, alberti, perceived, the, role, of, architect, as, designer, unlike, brunelleschi, he, had, no, interest, in, the, construction, leaving, the, practicalities, to, builders, and, the, oversight, to, others, giorgio, vasari, who, argued, that, historical, progress, in, art, reached, its, peak, in, michelangelo, emphasized, alberti, s, scholarly, achievements, not, his, artistic, talents, he, spent, his, time, finding, out, about, the, world, and, studying, the, proportions, of, antiquities, but, above, all, following, his, natural, genius, he, concentrated, on, writing, rather, than, on, applied, work, in, on, painting, alberti, uses, the, expression, we, painters, but, as, a, painter, or, sculptor, he, was, a, dilettante, in, painting, alberti, achieved, nothing, of, any, great, importance, or, beauty, wrote, vasari, the, very, few, paintings, of, his, that, are, extant, are, far, from, perfect, but, this, is, not, surprising, since, he, devoted, himself, more, to, his, studies, than, to, draughtsmanship, jacob, burckhardt, portrayed, alberti, in, the, civilization, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, as, a, truly, universal, genius, and, leonardo, da, vinci, was, to, alberti, as, the, finisher, to, the, beginner, as, the, master, to, the, dilettante, would, only, that, vasari, s, work, were, here, supplemented, by, a, description, like, that, of, alberti, the, colossal, outlines, of, leonardo, s, nature, can, never, be, more, than, dimly, and, distantly, conceived, alberti, is, said, to, appear, in, mantegna, s, great, frescoes, in, the, camera, degli, sposi, as, the, older, man, dressed, in, dark, red, clothes, who, whispers, in, the, ear, of, ludovico, gonzaga, the, ruler, of, mantua, in, alberti, s, self, portrait, a, large, plaquette, he, is, clothed, as, a, roman, to, the, left, of, his, profile, is, a, winged, eye, on, the, reverse, side, is, the, question, quid, tum, what, then, taken, from, virgil, s, eclogues, so, what, if, amyntas, is, dark, quid, tum, si, fuscus, amyntas, violets, are, black, and, hyacinths, are, black, alberti, made,
