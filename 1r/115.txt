make, invisible, the, unavoidable, blemishes, of, my, soul, after, the, death, of, dali, s, mother, dal, s, father, married, her, sister, dal, did, not, resent, this, marriage, because, he, had,

nationalist, forces, in, 1936, at, the, beginning, of, the, spanish, civil, war, also, in, 1922, he, began, what, would, become, a, lifelong, relationship, with, the, prado, museum, which, he, felt, was, incontestably, the, best, museum, of, old, paintings, in, the, world, each, sunday, morning, dal, went, to, the, prado, to, study, the, works, of, the, great, masters, this, was, the, start, of, a, monk, like, period, for, me, devoted, entirely, to, solitary, work, visits, to, the, prado, where, pencil, in, hand, i, analyzed, all, of, the, great, masterpieces, studio, work, models, research, those, paintings, by, dal, in, which, he, experimented, with, cubism, earned, him, the, most, attention, from, his, fellow, students, since, there, were, no, cubist, artists, in, madrid, at, the, time, cabaret, scene, 1922, is, a, typical, example, of, such, work, through, his, association, with, members, of, the, ultra, group, dal, became, more, acquainted, with, avant, garde, movements, including, dada, and, futurism, one, of, his, earliest, works, to, show, a, strong, futurist, and, cubist, influence, was, the, watercolor, night, walking, dreams, 1922, at, this, time, dal, also, read, freud, and, lautr, amont, who, were, to, have, a, profound, influence, on, his, work, in, may, 1925, dal, exhibited, eleven, works, in, a, group, exhibition, held, by, the, newly, formed, sociedad, ib, rica, de, artistas, in, madrid, seven, of, the, works, were, in, his, cubist, mode, and, four, in, a, more, realist, style, several, leading, critics, praised, his, work, dal, held, his, first, solo, exhibition, at, galeries, dalmau, in, barcelona, from, 14, to, 27, november, 1925, this, exhibition, before, his, exposure, to, surrealism, included, twenty, two, works, and, was, a, critical, and, commercial, success, in, april, 1926, dal, made, his, first, trip, to, paris, where, he, met, pablo, picasso, whom, he, revered, picasso, had, already, heard, favorable, reports, about, dal, from, joan, mir, a, fellow, catalan, who, later, introduced, him, to, many, surrealist, friends, as, he, developed, his, own, style, over, the, next, few, years, dal, made, some, works, strongly, influenced, by, picasso, and, mir, dal, was, also, influenced, by, the, work, of, yves, tanguy, and, he, later, allegedly, told, tanguy, s, niece, i, pinched, everything, from, your, uncle, yves, dal, left, the, royal, academy, in, 1926, shortly, before, his, final, exams, his, mastery, of, painting, skills, at, that, time, was, evidenced, by, his, realistic, the, basket, of, bread, painted, in, 1926, later, that, year, he, exhibited, again, at, galeries, dalmau, from, 31, december, 1926, to, 14, january, 1927, with, the, support, of, the, art, critic, sebasti, gasch, the, show, included, twenty, three, paintings, and, seven, drawings, with, the, cubist, works, displayed, in, a, separate, section, from, the, objective, works, the, critical, response, was, generally, positive, with, composition, with, three, figures, neo, cubist, academy, singled, out, for, particular, attention, from, 1927, dal, s, work, became, increasingly, influenced, by, surrealism, two, of, these, works, honey, is, sweeter, than, blood, 1927, and, gadget, and, hand, 1927, were, shown, at, the, annual, autumn, salon, sal, de, tardor, in, barcelona, in, october, 1927, dal, described, the, earlier, of, these, works, honey, is, sweeter, than, blood, as, equidistant, between, cubism, and, surrealism, the, works, featured, many, elements, that, were, to, become, characteristic, of, his, surrealist, period, including, dreamlike, images, precise, draftsmanship, idiosyncratic, iconography, such, as, rotting, donkeys, and, dismembered, bodies, and, lighting, and, landscapes, strongly, evocative, of, his, native, catalonia, the, works, provoked, bemusement, among, the, public, and, debate, among, critics, about, whether, dal, had, become, a, surrealist, influenced, by, his, reading, of, freud, dal, increasingly, introduced, suggestive, sexual, imagery, and, symbolism, into, his, work, he, submitted, dialogue, on, the, beach, unsatisfied, desires, 1928, to, the, barcelona, autumn, salon, for, 1928, but, the, work, was, rejected, because, it, was, not, fit, to, be, exhibited, in, any, gallery, habitually, visited, by, the, numerous, public, little, prepared, for, certain, surprises, the, resulting, scandal, was, widely, covered, in, the, barcelona, press, and, prompted, a, popular, madrid, illustrated, weekly, to, publish, an, interview, with, dal, some, trends, in, dal, s, work, that, would, continue, throughout, his, life, were, already, evident, in, the, 1920s, dal, was, influenced, by, many, styles, of, art, ranging, from, the, most, academically, classic, to, the, most, cutting, edge, avant, garde, his, classical, influences, included, raphael, bronzino, francisco, de, zurbar, n, vermeer, and, vel, zquez, exhibitions, of, his, works, attracted, much, attention, and, a, mixture, of, praise, and, puzzled, debate, from, critics, who, noted, an, apparent, inconsistency, in, his, work, by, the, use, of, both, traditional, and, modern, techniques, and, motifs, between, works, and, within, individual, works, in, the, mid, 1920s, dal, grew, a, neatly, trimmed, mustache, in, later, decades, he, cultivated, a, more, flamboyant, one, in, the, manner, of, 17th, century, spanish, master, painter, diego, vel, zquez, and, this, mustache, became, a, well, known, dal, icon, in, 1929, dal, collaborated, with, surrealist, film, director, luis, bu, uel, on, the, short, film, un, chien, andalou, an, andalusian, dog, his, main, contribution, was, to, help, bu, uel, write, the, script, for, the, film, dal, later, claimed, to, have, also, played, a, significant, role, in, the, filming, of, the, project, but, this, is, not, substantiated, by, contemporary, accounts, in, august, 1929, dal, met, his, lifelong, muse, and, future, wife, gala, born, elena, ivanovna, diakonova, she, was, a, russian, immigrant, ten, years, his, senior, who, at, that, time, was, married, to, surrealist, poet, paul, luard, in, works, such, as, the, first, days, of, spring, the, great, masturbator, and, the, lugubrious, game, dal, continued, his, exploration, of, the, themes, of, sexual, anxiety, and, unconscious, desires, dal, s, first, paris, exhibition, was, at, the, recently, opened, goemans, gallery, in, november, 1929, and, featured, eleven, works, in, his, preface, to, the, catalog, andr, breton, described, dal, s, new, work, as, the, most, hallucinatory, that, has, been, produced, up, to, now, the, exhibition, was, a, commercial, success, but, the, critical, response, was, divided, in, the, same, year, dal, officially, joined, the, surrealist, group, in, the, montparnasse, quarter, of, paris, the, surrealists, hailed, what, dal, was, later, to, call, his, paranoiac, critical, method, of, accessing, the, subconscious, for, greater, artistic, creativity, meanwhile, dal, s, relationship, with, his, father, was, close, to, rupture, don, salvador, dal, y, cusi, strongly, disapproved, of, his, son, s, romance, with, gala, and, saw, his, connection, to, the, surrealists, as, a, bad, influence, on, his, morals, the, final, straw, was, when, don, salvador, read, in, a, barcelona, newspaper, that, his, son, had, recently, exhibited, in, paris, a, drawing, of, the, sacred, heart, of, jesus, christ, with, a, provocative, inscription, sometimes, i, spit, for, fun, on, my, mother, s, portrait, outraged, don, salvador, demanded, that, his, son, recant, publicly, dal, refused, perhaps, out, of, fear, of, expulsion, from, the, surrealist, group, and, was, violently, thrown, out, of, his, paternal, home, on, 28, december, 1929, his, father, told, him, that, he, would, be, disinherited, and, that, he, should, never, set, foot, in, cadaqu, s, again, the, following, summer, dal, and, gala, rented, a, small, fisherman, s, cabin, in, a, nearby, bay, at, port, lligat, he, soon, bought, the, cabin, and, over, the, years, enlarged, it, by, buying, neighboring, ones, gradually, building, his, beloved, villa, by, the, sea, dal, s, father, would, eventually, relent, and, come, to, accept, his, son, s, companion, in, 1931, dal, painted, one, of, his, most, famous, works, the, persistence, of, memory, which, developed, a, surrealistic, image, of, soft, melting, pocket, watches, the, general, interpretation, of, the, work, is, that, the, soft, watches, are, a, rejection, of, the, assumption, that, time, is, rigid, or, deterministic, this, idea, is, supported, by, other, images, in, the, work, such, as, the, wide, expanding, landscape, and, other, limp, watches, shown, being, devoured, by, ants, dal, had, two, important, exhibitions, at, the, pierre, colle, gallery, in, paris, in, june, 1931, and, may, june, 1932, the, earlier, exhibition, included, sixteen, paintings, of, which, the, persistence, of, memory, attracted, the, most, attention, some, of, the, notable, features, of, the, exhibitions, were, the, proliferation, of, images, and, references, to, dal, s, muse, gala, and, the, inclusion, of, surrealist, objects, such, as, hypnagogic, clock, and, clock, based, on, the, decomposition, of, bodies, dal, s, last, and, largest, the, exhibition, at, the, pierre, colle, gallery, was, held, in, june, 1933, and, included, twenty, two, paintings, ten, drawings, and, two, objects, one, critic, noted, dal, s, precise, draftsmanship, and, attention, to, detail, describing, him, as, a, paranoiac, of, geometrical, temperament, dal, s, first, new, york, exhibition, was, held, at, julien, levy, s, gallery, in, november, december, 1933, the, exhibition, featured, twenty, six, works, and, was, a, commercial, and, critical, success, the, new, yorker, critic, praised, the, precision, and, lack, of, sentimentality, in, the, works, calling, them, frozen, nightmares, dal, and, gala, having, lived, together, since, 1929, were, civilly, married, on, 30, january, 1934, in, paris, they, later, remarried, in, a, church, ceremony, on, 8, august, 1958, at, sant, mart, vell, in, addition, to, inspiring, many, artworks, throughout, her, life, gala, would, act, as, dal, s, business, manager, supporting, their, extravagant, lifestyle, while, adeptly, steering, clear, of, insolvency, gala, who, herself, engaged, in, extra, marital, affairs, seemed, to, tolerate, dal, s, dalliances, with, younger, muses, secure, in, her, own, position, as, his, primary, relationship, dal, continued, to, paint, her, as, they, both, aged, producing, sympathetic, and, adoring, images, of, her, the, tense, complex, and, ambiguous, relationship, lasting, over, 50, years, would, later, become, the, subject, of, an, opera, jo, dal, i, dal, by, catalan, composer, xavier, benguerel, dal, s, first, visit, to, the, united, states, in, november, 1934, attracted, widespread, press, coverage, his, second, new, york, exhibition, was, held, at, the, julien, levy, gallery, in, november, december, 1934, and, was, again, a, commercial, and, critical, success, dal, delivered, three, lectures, on, surrealism, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, and, other, venues, during, which, he, told, his, audience, for, the, first, time, that, he, only, difference, between, me, and, a, madman, is, that, i, am, not, mad, the, heiress, caresse, crosby, the, inventor, of, the, brassiere, organized, a, farewell, fancy, dress, ball, for, dal, on, 18, january, 1935, dal, wore, a, glass, case, on, his, chest, containing, a, brassiere, and, gala, dressed, as, a, woman, giving, birth, through, her, head, a, paris, newspaper, later, claimed, that, the, dal, s, had, dressed, as, the, lindbergh, baby, and, his, kidnapper, a, claim, which, dal, denied, while, the, majority, of, the, surrealist, group, had, become, increasingly, associated, with, leftist, politics, dal, maintained, an, ambiguous, position, on, the, subject, of, the, proper, relationship, between, politics, and, art, leading, surrealist, andr, breton, accused, dal, of, defending, the, new, and, irrational, in, the, hitler, phenomenon, but, dal, quickly, rejected, this, claim, saying, i, am, hitlerian, neither, in, fact, nor, intention, dal, insisted, that, surrealism, could, exist, in, an, apolitical, context, and, refused, to, explicitly, denounce, fascism, later, in, 1934, dal, was, subjected, to, a, trial, in, which, he, narrowly, avoided, being, expelled, from, the, surrealist, group, to, this, dal, retorted, the, difference, between, the, surrealists, and, me, is, that, i, am, a, surrealist, in, 1936, dal, took, part, in, the, london, international, surrealist, exhibition, his, lecture, titled, fant, mes, paranoiacs, authentiques, was, delivered, while, wearing, a, deep, sea, diving, suit, and, helmet, he, had, arrived, carrying, a, billiard, cue, and, leading, a, pair, of, russian, wolfhounds, and, had, to, have, the, helmet, unscrewed, as, he, gasped, for, breath, he, commented, that, i, just, wanted, to, show, that, i, was, plunging, deeply, into, the, human, mind, dal, s, first, solo, london, exhibition, was, held, at, the, alex, reid, and, lefevre, gallery, the, same, year, the, show, included, twenty, nine, paintings, and, eighteen, drawings, the, critical, response, was, generally, favorable, although, the, daily, telegraph, critic, wrote, these, pictures, from, the, subconscious, reveal, so, skilled, a, craftsman, that, the, artist, s, return, to, full, consciousness, may, be, awaited, with, interest, in, december, 1936, dal, participated, in, the, fantastic, art, dada, surrealism, exhibition, at, moma, and, a, solo, exhibition, at, the, julien, levy, gallery, in, new, york, both, exhibitions, attracted, large, attendances, and, widespread, press, coverage, the, painting, soft, construction, with, boiled, beans, premonition, of, civil, war, 1936, attracted, particular, attention, dal, later, described, it, as, a, vast, human, body, breaking, out, into, monstrous, excrescences, of, arms, and, legs, tearing, at, one, another, in, a, delirium, of, auto, strangulation, on, 14, december, dal, aged, 32, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, time, magazine, from, 1933, dal, was, supported, by, zodiac, a, group, of, affluent, admirers, who, each, contributed, to, a, monthly, stipend, for, the, painter, in, exchange, for, a, painting, of, their, choice, from, 1936, dal, s, main, patron, in, london, was, the, wealthy, edward, james, who, would, support, him, financially, for, two, years, one, of, dal, s, most, important, paintings, from, the, period, of, james, patronage, was, the, metamorphosis, of, narcissus, 1937, they, also, collaborated, on, two, of, the, most, enduring, icons, of, the, surrealist, movement, the, lobster, telephone, and, the, mae, west, lips, sofa, dal, was, in, london, when, the, spanish, civil, war, broke, out, in, july, 1936, when, he, later, learned, that, his, friend, lorca, had, been, executed, by, nationalist, forces, dal, s, claimed, response, was, to, shout, ol, dal, was, to, include, frequent, references, to, the, poet, in, his, art, and, writings, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, nevertheless, dal, avoided, taking, a, public, stand, for, or, against, the, republic, for, the, duration, of, the, conflict, in, january, 1938, dal, unveiled, rainy, taxi, a, three, dimensional, artwork, consisting, of, an, automobile, and, two, mannequin, occupants, being, soaked, with, rain, from, within, the, taxi, the, piece, was, first, displayed, at, the, galerie, beaux, arts, in, paris, at, the, exposition, internationale, du, surr, alisme, organized, by, andr, breton, and, paul, luard, the, exposition, was, designed, by, artist, marcel, duchamp, who, also, served, as, host, in, march, that, year, dal, met, sigmund, freud, thanks, to, stefan, zweig, as, dal, sketched, freud, s, portrait, freud, whispered, that, boy, looks, like, a, fanatic, dal, was, delighted, upon, hearing, later, about, this, comment, from, his, hero, the, following, day, freud, wrote, to, zweig, until, now, i, have, been, inclined, to, regard, the, surrealists, who, have, apparently, adopted, me, as, their, patron, saint, as, complete, fools, that, young, spaniard, with, his, candid, fanatical, eyes, and, his, undeniable, technical, mastery, has, changed, my, estimate, it, would, indeed, be, very, interesting, to, investigate, analytically, how, he, came, to, create, that, picture, in, september, 1938, salvador, dal, was, invited, by, gabrielle, coco, chanel, to, her, house, la, pausa, in, roquebrune, on, the, french, riviera, there, he, painted, numerous, paintings, he, later, exhibited, at, julien, levy, gallery, in, new, york, this, exhibition, in, march, april, 1939, included, twenty, one, paintings, and, eleven, drawings, life, reported, that, no, exhibition, in, new, york, had, been, so, popular, since, whistler, s, mother, was, shown, in, 1934, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, dal, debuted, his, dream, of, venus, surrealist, pavilion, located, in, the, amusements, area, of, the, exposition, it, featured, bizarre, sculptures, statues, mermaids, and, live, nude, models, in, costumes, made, of, fresh, seafood, an, event, photographed, by, horst, p, horst, george, platt, lynes, and, murray, korman, dal, was, angered, by, changes, to, his, designs, railing, against, mediocrities, who, thought, that, a, woman, with, the, tail, of, a, fish, is, possible, a, woman, with, the, head, of, a, fish, impossible, soon, after, franco, s, victory, in, the, spanish, civil, war, in, april, 1939, dal, wrote, to, luis, bu, uel, denouncing, socialism, and, marxism, and, praising, catholicism, and, the, falange, as, a, result, bu, uel, broke, off, relations, with, dal, in, the, may, issue, of, the, surrealist, magazine, minotaure, andr, breton, announced, dal, s, expulsion, from, the, surrealist, group, claiming, that, dal, had, espoused, race, war, and, that, the, over, refinement, of, his, paranoiac, critical, method, was, a,

an, anagram, for, salvador, dal, this, was, a, derisive, reference, to, the, increasing, commercialization, of, dal, s, work, and, the, perception, that, dal, sought, self, aggrandizement, through,

appeal, from, the, claimant, and, ordered, her, to, pay, the, costs, of, the, exhumation, from, the, late, 1920s, dal, progressively, introduced, many, bizarre, or, incongruous, images, into, his, work, which, invite, symbolic, interpretation, while, some, of, these, images, suggest, a, straightforward, sexual, or, freudian, interpretation, dal, read, freud, in, the, 1920s, others, such, as, locusts, rotting, donkeys, and, sea, urchins, are, idiosyncratic, and, have, been, variously, interpreted, some, commentators, have, cautioned, that, dal, s, own, comments, on, these, images, are, not, always, reliable, food, and, eating, have, a, central, place, in, dal, s, thoughts, and, work, he, associated, food, with, beauty, and, sex, and, was, obsessed, with, the, image, of, the, female, praying, mantis, eating, her, mate, after, copulation, bread, was, a, recurring, image, in, dal, s, art, from, his, early, work, the, basket, of, bread, to, later, public, performances, such, as, in, 1958, when, he, gave, a, lecture, in, paris, using, a, 12, meter, long, baguette, an, illustrative, prop, he, saw, bread, as, the, elementary, basis, of, continuity, and, sacred, subsistence, the, egg, is, another, common, dal, nian, image, he, connects, the, egg, to, the, prenatal, and, intrauterine, thus, using, it, to, symbolize, hope, and, love, it, appears, in, the, great, masturbator, the, metamorphosis, of, narcissus, and, many, other, works, there, are, also, giant, sculptures, of, eggs, in, various, locations, at, dal, s, house, in, portlligat, as, well, as, at, the, dal,

became, a, recurring, theme, in, his, work, the, famous, melting, watches, that, appear, in, the, persistence, of, memory, suggest, einstein, s, theory, that, time, is, relative, and, not, fixed, dal, later, claimed, that, the, idea, for, clocks, functioning, symbolically, in, this, way, came, to, him, when, he, was, contemplating, camembert, cheese, the, rhinoceros, and, rhinoceros, horn, shapes, began, to, proliferate, in, dal, s, work, from, the, mid, 1950s, according, to, dal, the, rhinoceros, horn, signifies, divine, geometry, because, it, grows, in, a, logarithmic, spiral, he, linked, the, rhinoceros, to, themes, of, chastity, and, to, the, virgin, mary, however, he, also, used, it, as, an, obvious, phallic, symbol, as, in, young, virgin, auto, sodomized, by, the, horns, of, her, own, chastity, various, other, animals, appear, throughout, dal, s, work, rotting, donkeys, and, ants, have, been, interpreted, as, pointing, to, death, decay, and, sexual, desire, the, snail, as, connected, to, the, human, head, he, saw, a, snail, on, a, bicycle, outside, freud, s, house, when, he, first, met, him, and, locusts, as, a, symbol, of, waste, and, fear, the, elephant, is, also, a, recurring, image, in, his, work, for, example, dream, caused, by, the, flight, of, a, bee, around, a, pomegranate, a, second, before, awakening, the, elephants, are, inspired, by, gian, lorenzo, bernini, s, sculpture, base, in, rome, of, an, elephant, carrying, an, ancient, obelisk, dal, s, life, long, interest, in, science, and, mathematics, was, often, reflected, in, his, work, his, soft, watches, have, been, interpreted, as, references, to, einstein, s, theory, of, the, relativity, of, time, and, space, images, of, atomic, particles, appeared, in, his, work, soon, after, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, strands, of, dna, appeared, from, the, mid, 1950s, in, 1958, he, wrote, in, his, anti, matter, manifesto, in, the, surrealist, period, i, wanted, to, create, the, iconography, of, the, interior, world, and, the, world, of, the, marvelous, of, my, father, freud, today, the, exterior, world, and, that, of, physics, have, transcended, the, one, of, psychology, my, father, today, is, dr, heisenberg, the, disintegration, of, the, persistence, of, memory, 1954, harks, back, to, the, persistence, of, memory, 1931, and, in, portraying, that, painting, in, fragmentation, and, disintegration, has, been, interpreted, as, a, reference, to, heisenberg, s, quantum, mechanics, dal, was, a, versatile, artist, some, of, his, more, popular, works, are, sculptures, and, other, objects, and, he, is, also, noted, for, his, contributions, to, theater, fashion, and, photography, among, other, areas, from, the, early, 1930s, dal, was, an, enthusiastic, proponent, of, the, proliferation, of, three, dimensional, surrealist, objects, to, subvert, perceptions, of, conventional, reality, writing, museums, will, fast, fill, with, objects, whose, uselessness, size, and, crowding, will, necessitate, the, construction, in, deserts, of, special, towers, to, contain, them, his, more, notable, early, objects, include, board, of, demented, associations, 1930, 31, retrospective, bust, of, a, woman, 1933, venus, de, milo, with, chest, of, drawers, 1936, and, aphrodisiac, dinner, jacket, 1936, two, of, the, most, popular, objects, of, the, surrealist, movement, were, lobster, telephone, 1936, and, mae, west, lips, sofa, 1937, which, were, commissioned, by, art, patron, edward, james, lobsters, and, telephones, had, strong, sexual, connotations, for, dal, who, drew, a, close, analogy, between, food, and, sex, the, telephone, was, functional, and, james, purchased, four, of, them, from, dal, to, replace, the, phones, in, his, home, the, mae, west, lips, sofa, was, shaped, after, the, lips, of, actress, mae, west, who, was, previously, the, subject, of, dal, s, watercolor, the, face, of, mae, west, which, may, be, used, as, a, surrealist, apartment, 1934, 35, in, december, 1936, dal, sent, harpo, marx, a, christmas, present, of, a, harp, with, barbed, wire, strings, after, world, war, ii, dal, authorized, many, sculptures, derived, from, his, most, famous, works, and, images, in, his, later, years, other, sculptures, also, appeared, often, in, large, editions, whose, authenticity, has, sometimes, been, questioned, between, 1941, and, 1970, dal, created, an, ensemble, of, 39, pieces, of, jewelry, many, of, which, are, intricate, some, containing, moving, parts, the, most, famous, assemblage, the, royal, heart, is, made, of, gold, and, is, encrusted, with, 46, rubies, 42, diamonds, and, four, emeralds, created, in, such, a, way, that, the, center, beats, like, a, heart, dal, ventured, into, industrial, design, in, the, 1970s, with, a, 500, piece, run, of, suomi, tableware, by, timo, sarpaneva, that, dal, decorated, for, the, german, rosenthal, porcelain, maker, s, studio, linie, in,

was, young, going, to, the, theater, most, sundays, by, the, late, 1920s, he, was, fascinated, by, the, potential, of, film, to, reveal, the, unlimited, fantasy, born, of, things, themselves, and, went, on, to, collaborate, with, the, director, luis, bu, uel, on, two, surrealist, films, the, 17, minute, short, un, chien, andalou, 1929, and, the, feature, film, l, age, d, or, 1930, dal, and, bu, uel, agree, that, they, jointly, developed, the, script, and, imagery, of, un, chien, andalou, but, there, is, controversy, over, the, extent, of, dal, s, contribution, to, l, age, d, or, un, chien, andalou, features, a, graphic, opening, scene, of, a, human, eyeball, being, slashed, with, a, razor, and, develops, surreal, imagery, and, irrational, discontinuities, in, time, and, space, to, produce, a, dreamlike, quality, l, age, d, or, is, more, overtly, anti, clerical, and, anti, establishment, and, was, banned, after, right, wing, groups, staged, a, riot, in, the, parisian, theater, where, it, was, being, shown, summarizing, the, impact, of, these, two, films, on, the, surrealist, film, movement, one, commentator, has, stated, if, un, chien, andalou, stands, as, the, supreme, record, of, surrealism, s, adventures, into, the, realm, of, the, unconscious, then, l, ge, d, or, is, perhaps, the, most, trenchant, and, implacable, expression, of, its, revolutionary, intent, after, he, collaborated, with, bu, uel, dal, worked, on, several, unrealized, film, projects, including, a, published, script, for, a, film, babaouo, 1932, a, scenario, for, harpo, marx, called,
