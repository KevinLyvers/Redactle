srinivasa, ramanujan, aiyangar, 22, december, 1887, 26, april, 1920, was, an, indian, mathematician, though, he, had, almost, no, formal, training, in, pure, mathematics, he, made, substantial, contributions, to, mathematical, analysis, number, theory, infinite, series, and, continued, fractions, including, solutions, to, mathematical, problems, then, considered, unsolvable, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, all, time, ramanujan, initially, developed, his, own, mathematical, research, in, isolation, according, to, hans, eysenck, he, tried, to, interest, the, leading, professional, mathematicians, in, his, work, but, failed, for, the, most, part, what, he, had, to, show, them, was, too, novel, too, unfamiliar, and, additionally, presented, in, unusual, ways, they, could, not, be, bothered, seeking, mathematicians, who, could, better, understand, his, work, in, 1913, he, began, a, mail, correspondence, with, the, english, mathematician, g, h, hardy, at, the, university, of, cambridge, england, recognising, ramanujan, s, work, as, extraordinary, hardy, arranged, for, him, to, travel, to, cambridge, in, his, notes, hardy, commented, that, ramanujan, had, produced, groundbreaking, new, theorems, including, some, that, defeated, me, completely, i, had, never, seen, anything, in, the, least, like, them, before, and, some, recently, proven, but, highly, advanced, results, during, his, short, life, ramanujan, independently, compiled, nearly, 3, 900, results, mostly, identities, and, equations, many, were, completely, novel, his, original, and, highly, unconventional, results, such, as, the, ramanujan, prime, the, ramanujan, theta, function, partition, formulae, and, mock, theta, functions, have, opened, entire, new, areas, of, work, and, inspired, further, research, of, his, thousands, of, results, most, have, been, proven, correct, the, ramanujan, journal, a, scientific, journal, was, established, to, publish, work, in, all, areas, of, mathematics, influenced, by, ramanujan, and, his, notebooks, containing, summaries, of, his, published, and, unpublished, results, have, been, analysed, and, studied, for, decades, since, his, death, as, a, source, of, new, mathematical, ideas, as, late, as, 2012, researchers, continued, to, discover, that, mere, comments, in, his, writings, about, simple, properties, and, similar, outputs, for, certain, findings, were, themselves, profound, and, subtle, number, theory, results, that, remained, unsuspected, until, nearly, a, century, after, his, death, he, became, one, of, the, youngest, fellows, of, the, royal, society, and, only, the, second, indian, member, and, the, first, indian, to, be, elected, a, fellow, of, trinity, college, cambridge, in, 1919, ill, health, now, believed, to, have, been, hepatic, amoebiasis, a, complication, from, episodes, of, dysentery, many, years, previously, compelled, ramanujan, s, return, to, india, where, he, died, in, 1920, at, the, age, of, 32, his, last, letters, to, hardy, written, in, january, 1920, show, that, he, was, still, continuing, to, produce, new, mathematical, ideas, and, theorems, his, lost, notebook, containing, discoveries, from, the, last, year, of, his, life, caused, great, excitement, among, mathematicians, when, it, was, rediscovered, in, 1976, ramanujan, literally, younger, brother, of, rama, a, hindu, deity, was, born, on, 22, december, 1887, into, a, tamil, brahmin, iyengar, family, in, erode, in, present, day, tamil, nadu, his, father, kuppuswamy, srinivasa, iyengar, originally, from, thanjavur, district, worked, as, a, clerk, in, a, sari, shop, his, mother, komalatammal, was, a, housewife, and, sang, at, a, local, temple, they, lived, in, a, small, traditional, home, on, sarangapani, sannidhi, street, in, the, town, of, kumbakonam, the, family, home, is, now, a, museum, when, ramanujan, was, a, year, and, a, half, old, his, mother, gave, birth, to, a, son, sadagopan, who, died, less, than, three, months, later, in, december, 1889, ramanujan, contracted, smallpox, but, recovered, unlike, the, 4, 000, others, who, died, in, a, bad, year, in, the, thanjavur, district, around, this, time, he, moved, with, his, mother, to, her, parents, house, in, kanchipuram, near, madras, now, chennai, his, mother, gave, birth, to, two, more, children, in, 1891, and, 1894, both, of, whom, died, before, their, first, birthdays, on, 1, october, 1892, ramanujan, was, enrolled, at, the, local, school, after, his, maternal, grandfather, lost, his, job, as, a, court, official, in, kanchipuram, ramanujan, and, his, mother, moved, back, to, kumbakonam, and, he, was, enrolled, in, kangayan, primary, school, when, his, paternal, grandfather, died, he, was, sent, back, to, his, maternal, grandparents, then, living, in, madras, he, did, not, like, school, in, madras, and, tried, to, avoid, attending, his, family, enlisted, a, local, constable, to, make, sure, he, attended, school, within, six, months, ramanujan, was, back, in, kumbakonam, since, ramanujan, s, father, was, at, work, most, of, the, day, his, mother, took, care, of, the, boy, and, they, had, a, close, relationship, from, her, he, learned, about, tradition, and, puranas, to, sing, religious, songs, to, attend, pujas, at, the, temple, and, to, maintain, particular, eating, habits, all, part, of, brahmin, culture, at, kangayan, primary, school, ramanujan, performed, well, just, before, turning, 10, in, november, 1897, he, passed, his, primary, examinations, in, english, tamil, geography, and, arithmetic, with, the, best, scores, in, the, district, that, year, ramanujan, entered, town, higher, secondary, school, where, he, encountered, formal, mathematics, for, the, first, time, a, child, prodigy, by, age, 11, he, had, exhausted, the, mathematical, knowledge, of, two, college, students, who, were, lodgers, at, his, home, he, was, later, lent, a, book, written, by, s, l, loney, on, advanced, trigonometry, he, mastered, this, by, the, age, of, 13, while, discovering, sophisticated, theorems, on, his, own, by, 14, he, received, merit, certificates, and, academic, awards, that, continued, throughout, his, school, career, and, he, assisted, the, school, in, the, logistics, of, assigning, its, 1, 200, students, each, with, differing, needs, to, its, approximately, 35, teachers, he, completed, mathematical, exams, in, half, the, allotted, time, and, showed, a, familiarity, with, geometry, and, infinite, series, ramanujan, was, shown, how, to, solve, cubic, equations, in, 1902, he, would, later, develop, his, own, method, to, solve, the, quartic, in, 1903, he, tried, to, solve, the, quintic, not, knowing, that, it, was, impossible, to, solve, with, radicals, in, 1903, when, he, was, 16, ramanujan, obtained, from, a, friend, a, library, copy, of, a, synopsis, of, elementary, results, in, pure, and, applied, mathematics, g, s, carr, s, collection, of, 5, 000, theorems, ramanujan, reportedly, studied, the, contents, of, the, book, in, detail, the, next, year, ramanujan, independently, developed, and, investigated, the, bernoulli, numbers, and, calculated, the, euler, mascheroni, constant, up, to, 15, decimal, places, his, peers, at, the, time, said, they, rarely, understood, him, and, stood, in, respectful, awe, of, him, when, he, graduated, from, town, higher, secondary, school, in, 1904, ramanujan, was, awarded, the, k, ranganatha, rao, prize, for, mathematics, by, the, school, s, headmaster, krishnaswami, iyer, iyer, introduced, ramanujan, as, an, outstanding, student, who, deserved, scores, higher, than, the, maximum, he, received, a, scholarship, to, study, at, government, arts, college, kumbakonam, but, was, so, intent, on, mathematics, that, he, could, not, focus, on, any, other, subjects, and, failed, most, of, them, losing, his, scholarship, in, the, process, in, august, 1905, ramanujan, ran, away, from, home, heading, towards, visakhapatnam, and, stayed, in, rajahmundry, for, about, a, month, he, later, enrolled, at, pachaiyappa, s, college, in, madras, there, he, passed, in, mathematics, choosing, only, to, attempt, questions, that, appealed, to, him, and, leaving, the, rest, unanswered, but, performed, poorly, in, other, subjects, such, as, english, physiology, and, sanskrit, ramanujan, failed, his, fellow, of, arts, exam, in, december, 1906, and, again, a, year, later, without, an, fa, degree, he, left, college, and, continued, to, pursue, independent, research, in, mathematics, living, in, extreme, poverty, and, often, on, the, brink, of, starvation, in, 1910, after, a, meeting, between, the, 23, year, old, ramanujan, and, the, founder, of, the, indian, mathematical, society, v, ramaswamy, aiyer, ramanujan, began, to, get, recognition, in, madras, s, mathematical, circles, leading, to, his, inclusion, as, a, researcher, at, the, university, of, madras, on, 14, july, 1909, ramanujan, married, janaki, janakiammal, 21, march, 1899, 13, april, 1994, a, girl, his, mother, had, selected, for, him, a, year, earlier, and, who, was, ten, years, old, when, they, married, it, was, not, unusual, then, for, marriages, to, be, arranged, with, girls, at, a, young, age, janaki, was, from, rajendram, a, village, close, to, marudur, karur, district, railway, station, ramanujan, s, father, did, not, participate, in, the, marriage, ceremony, as, was, common, at, that, time, janaki, continued, to, stay, at, her, maternal, home, for, three, years, after, marriage, until, she, reached, puberty, in, 1912, she, and, ramanujan, s, mother, joined, ramanujan, in, madras, after, the, marriage, ramanujan, developed, a, hydrocele, testis, the, condition, could, be, treated, with, a, routine, surgical, operation, that, would, release, the, blocked, fluid, in, the, scrotal, sac, but, his, family, could, not, afford, the, operation, in, january, 1910, a, doctor, volunteered, to, do, the, surgery, at, no, cost, after, his, successful, surgery, ramanujan, searched, for, a, job, he, stayed, at, a, friend, s, house, while, he, went, from, door, to, door, around, madras, looking, for, a, clerical, position, to, make, money, he, tutored, students, at, presidency, college, who, were, preparing, for, their, fellow, of, arts, exam, in, late, 1910, ramanujan, was, sick, again, he, feared, for, his, health, and, told, his, friend, r, radakrishna, iyer, to, hand, over, to, professor, singaravelu, mudaliar, or, to, the, british, professor, edward, b, ross, of, the, madras, christian, college, after, ramanujan, recovered, and, retrieved, his, notebooks, from, iyer, he, took, a, train, from, kumbakonam, to, villupuram, a, city, under, french, control, in, 1912, ramanujan, moved, with, his, wife, and, mother, to, a, house, in, saiva, muthaiah, mudali, street, george, town, madras, where, they, lived, for, a, few, months, in, may, 1913, upon, securing, a, research, position, at, madras, university, ramanujan, moved, with, his, family, to, triplicane, in, 1910, ramanujan, met, deputy, collector, v, ramaswamy, aiyer, who, founded, the, indian, mathematical, society, wishing, for, a, job, at, the, revenue, department, where, aiyer, worked, ramanujan, showed, him, his, mathematics, notebooks, as, aiyer, later, recalled, i, was, struck, by, the, extraordinary, mathematical, results, contained, in, i, had, no, mind, to, smother, his, genius, by, an, appointment, in, the, lowest, rungs, of, the, revenue, department, aiyer, sent, ramanujan, with, letters, of, introduction, to, his, mathematician, friends, in, madras, some, of, them, looked, at, his, work, and, gave, him, letters, of, introduction, to, r, ramachandra, rao, the, district, collector, for, nellore, and, the, secretary, of, the, indian, mathematical, society, rao, was, impressed, by, ramanujan, s, research, but, doubted, that, it, was, his, own, work, ramanujan, mentioned, a, correspondence, he, had, with, professor, saldhana, a, notable, bombay, mathematician, in, which, saldhana, expressed, a, lack, of, understanding, of, his, work, but, concluded, that, he, was, not, a, fraud, ramanujan, s, friend, c, v, rajagopalachari, tried, to, quell, rao, s, doubts, about, ramanujan, s, academic, integrity, rao, agreed, to, give, him, another, chance, and, listened, as, ramanujan, discussed, elliptic, integrals, hypergeometric, series, and, his, theory, of, divergent, series, which, rao, said, ultimately, convinced, him, of, ramanujan, s, brilliance, when, rao, asked, him, what, he, wanted, ramanujan, replied, that, he, needed, work, and, financial, support, rao, consented, and, sent, him, to, madras, he, continued, his, research, with, rao, s, financial, aid, with, aiyer, s, help, ramanujan, had, his, work, published, in, the, journal, of, the, indian, mathematical, society, one, of, the, first, problems, he, posed, in, the, journal, was, to, find, the, value, of, he, waited, for, a, solution, to, be, offered, in, three, issues, over, six, months, but, failed, to, receive, any, at, the, end, ramanujan, supplied, an, incomplete, solution, to, the, problem, himself, on, page, 105, of, his, first, notebook, he, formulated, an, equation, that, could, be, used, to, solve, the, infinitely, nested, radicals, problem, using, this, equation, the, answer, to, the, question, posed, in, the, journal, was, simply, 3, obtained, by, setting, x, 2, n, 1, and, a, 0, ramanujan, wrote, his, first, formal, paper, for, the, journal, on, the, properties, of, bernoulli, numbers, one, property, he, discovered, was, that, the, denominators, of, the, fractions, of, bernoulli, numbers, sequence, a027642, in, the, oeis, are, always, divisible, by, six, he, also, devised, a, method, of, calculating, b, n, based, on, previous, bernoulli, numbers, one, of, these, methods, follows, it, will, be, observed, that, if, n, is, even, but, not, equal, to, zero, in, his, 17, page, paper, some, properties, of, bernoulli, s, numbers, 1911, ramanujan, gave, three, proofs, two, corollaries, and, three, conjectures, his, writing, initially, had, many, flaws, as, journal, editor, m, t, narayana, iyengar, noted, mr, ramanujan, s, methods, were, so, terse, and, novel, and, his, presentation, so, lacking, in, clearness, and, precision, that, the, ordinary, unaccustomed, to, such, intellectual, gymnastics, could, hardly, follow, him, ramanujan, later, wrote, another, paper, and, also, continued, to, provide, problems, in, the, journal, in, early, 1912, he, got, a, temporary, job, in, the, madras, accountant, general, s, office, with, a, monthly, salary, of, 20, rupees, he, lasted, only, a, few, weeks, toward, the, end, of, that, assignment, he, applied, for, a, position, under, the, chief, accountant, of, the, madras, port, trust, in, a, letter, dated, 9, february, 1912, ramanujan, wrote, sir, i, understand, there, is, a, clerkship, vacant, in, your, office, and, i, beg, to, apply, for, the, same, i, have, passed, the, matriculation, examination, and, studied, up, to, the, f, a, but, was, prevented, from, pursuing, my, studies, further, owing, to, several, untoward, circumstances, i, have, however, been, devoting, all, my, time, to, mathematics, and, developing, the, subject, i, can, say, i, am, quite, confident, i, can, do, justice, to, my, work, if, i, am, appointed, to, the, post, i, therefore, beg, to, request, that, you, will, be, good, enough, to, confer, the, appointment, on, me, attached, to, his, application, was, a, recommendation, from, e, w, middlemast, a, mathematics, professor, at, the, presidency, college, who, wrote, that, ramanujan, was, a, young, man, of, quite, exceptional, capacity, in, mathematics, three, weeks, after, he, applied, on, 1, march, ramanujan, learned, that, he, had, been, accepted, as, a, class, iii, grade, iv, accounting, clerk, making, 30, rupees, per, month, at, his, office, ramanujan, easily, and, quickly, completed, the, work, he, was, given, and, spent, his, spare, time, doing, mathematical, research, ramanujan, s, boss, sir, francis, spring, and, s, narayana, iyer, a, colleague, who, was, also, treasurer, of, the, indian, mathematical, society, encouraged, ramanujan, in, his, mathematical, pursuits, in, the, spring, of, 1913, narayana, iyer, ramachandra, rao, and, e, w, middlemast, tried, to, present, ramanujan, s, work, to, british, mathematicians, m, j, m, hill, of, university, college, london, commented, that, ramanujan, s, papers, were, riddled, with, holes, he, said, that, although, ramanujan, had, a, taste, for, mathematics, and, some, ability, he, lacked, the, necessary, educational, background, and, foundation, to, be, accepted, by, mathematicians, although, hill, did, not, offer, to, take, ramanujan, on, as, a, student, he, gave, thorough, and, serious, professional, advice, on, his, work, with, the, help, of, friends, ramanujan, drafted, letters, to, leading, mathematicians, at, cambridge, university, the, first, two, professors, h, f, baker, and, e, w, hobson, returned, ramanujan, s, papers, without, comment, on, 16, january, 1913, ramanujan, wrote, to, g, h, hardy, whom, he, knew, from, studying, orders, of, infinity, 1910, coming, from, an, unknown, mathematician, the, nine, pages, of, mathematics, made, hardy, initially, view, ramanujan, s, manuscripts, as, a, possible, fraud, hardy, recognised, some, of, ramanujan, s, formulae, but, others, seemed, scarcely, possible, to, believe, 494, one, of, the, theorems, hardy, found, amazing, was, on, the, bottom, of, page, three, valid, for, 0, a, b, 1, 2, hardy, was, also, impressed, by, some, of, ramanujan, s, other, work, relating, to, infinite, series, the, first, result, had, already, been, determined, by, g, bauer, in, 1859, the, second, was, new, to, hardy, and, was, derived, from, a, class, of, functions, called, hypergeometric, series, which, had, first, been, researched, by, euler, and, gauss, hardy, found, these, results, much, more, intriguing, than, gauss, s, work, on, integrals, after, seeing, ramanujan, s, theorems, on, continued, fractions, on, the, last, page, of, the, manuscripts, hardy, said, the, theorems, defeated, me, completely, i, had, never, seen, anything, in, the, least, like, them, before, and, that, they, must, be, true, because, if, they, were, not, true, no, one, would, have, the, imagination, to, invent, them, hardy, asked, a, colleague, j, e, littlewood, to, take, a, look, at, the, papers, littlewood, was, amazed, by, ramanujan, s, genius, after, discussing, the, papers, with, littlewood, hardy, concluded, that, the, letters, were, certainly, the, most, remarkable, i, have, received, and, that, ramanujan, was, a, mathematician, of, the, highest, quality, a, man, of, altogether, exceptional, originality, and, power, 494, 495, one, colleague, e, h, neville, later, remarked, that, no, one, who, was, in, the, mathematical, circles, in, cambridge, at, that, time, can, forget, the, sensation, caused, by, this, letter, not, one, could, have, been, set, in, the, most, advanced, mathematical, examination, in, the, world, on, 8, february, 1913, hardy, wrote, ramanujan, a, letter, expressing, interest, in, his, work, adding, that, it, was, essential, that, i, should, see, proofs, of, some, of, your, assertions, before, his, letter, arrived, in, madras, during, the, third, week, of, february, hardy, contacted, the, indian, office, to, plan, for, ramanujan, s, trip, to, cambridge, secretary, arthur, davies, of, the, advisory, committee, for, indian, students, met, with, ramanujan, to, discuss, the, overseas, trip, in, accordance, with, his, brahmin, upbringing, ramanujan, refused, to, leave, his, country, to, go, to, a, foreign, land, and, his, parents, were, also, opposed, for, the, same, reason, meanwhile, he, sent, hardy, a, letter, packed, with, theorems, writing, i, have, found, a, friend, in, you, who, views, my, labour, sympathetically, to, supplement, hardy, s, endorsement, gilbert, walker, a, former, mathematical, lecturer, at, trinity, college, cambridge, looked, at, ramanujan, s, work, and, expressed, amazement, urging, the, young, man, to, spend, time, at, cambridge, as, a, result, of, walker, s, endorsement, b, hanumantha, rao, a, mathematics, professor, at, an, engineering, college, invited, ramanujan, s, colleague, narayana, iyer, to, a, meeting, of, the, board, of, studies, in, mathematics, to, discuss, what, we, can, do, for, s, ramanujan, the, board, agreed, to, grant, ramanujan, a, monthly, research, scholarship, of, 75, rupees, for, the, next, two, years, at, the, university, of, madras, while, he, was, engaged, as, a, research, student, ramanujan, continued, to, submit, papers, to, the, journal, of, the, indian, mathematical, society, in, one, instance, iyer, submitted, some, of, ramanujan, s, theorems, on, summation, of, series, to, the, journal, adding, the, following, theorem, is, due, to, s, ramanujan, the, mathematics, student, of, madras, university, later, in, november, british, professor, edward, b, ross, of, madras, christian, college, whom, ramanujan, had, met, a, few, years, before, stormed, into, his, class, one, day, with, his, eyes, glowing, asking, his, students, does, ramanujan, know, polish, the, reason, was, that, in, one, paper, ramanujan, had, anticipated, the, work, of, a, polish, mathematician, whose, paper, had, just, arrived, in, the, day, s, mail, in, his, quarterly, papers, ramanujan, drew, up, theorems, to, make, definite, integrals, more, easily, solvable, working, off, giuliano, frullani, s, 1821, integral, theorem, ramanujan, formulated, generalisations, that, could, be, made, to, evaluate, formerly, unyielding, integrals, hardy, s, correspondence, with, ramanujan, soured, after, ramanujan, refused, to, come, to, england, hardy, enlisted, a, colleague, lecturing, in, madras, e, h, neville, to, mentor, and, bring, ramanujan, to, england, neville, asked, ramanujan, why, he, would, not, go, to, cambridge, ramanujan, apparently, had, now, accepted, the, proposal, neville, said, ramanujan, needed, no, converting, and, his, parents, opposition, had, been, withdrawn, apparently, ramanujan, s, mother, had, a, vivid, dream, in, which, ramanujan, was, surrounded, by, europeans, and, the, family, goddess, the, deity, of, namagiri, commanded, her, to, stand, no, longer, between, her, son, and, the, fulfilment, of, his, life, s, purpose, on, 17, march, 1914, ramanujan, travelled, to, england, by, ship, leaving, his, wife, to, stay, with, his, parents, in, india, ramanujan, departed, from, madras, aboard, the, s, s, nevasa, on, 17, march, 1914, when, he, disembarked, in, london, on, 14, april, neville, was, waiting, for, him, with, a, car, four, days, later, neville, took, him, to, his, house, on, chesterton, road, in, cambridge, ramanujan, immediately, began, his, work, with, littlewood, and, hardy, after, six, weeks, ramanujan, moved, out, of, neville, s, house, and, took, up, residence, on, whewell, s, court, a, five, minute, walk, from, hardy, s, room, hardy, and, littlewood, began, to, look, at, ramanujan, s, notebooks, hardy, had, already, received, 120, theorems, from, ramanujan, in, the, first, two, letters, but, there, were, many, more, results, and, theorems, in, the, notebooks, hardy, saw, that, some, were, wrong, others, had, already, been, discovered, and, the, rest, were, new, breakthroughs, ramanujan, left, a, deep, impression, on, hardy, and, littlewood, littlewood, commented, i, can, believe, that, he, s, at, least, a, jacobi, while, hardy, said, he, can, compare, him, only, with, euler, or, jacobi, ramanujan, spent, nearly, five, years, in, cambridge, collaborating, with, hardy, and, littlewood, and, published, part, of, his, findings, there, hardy, and, ramanujan, had, highly, contrasting, personalities, their, collaboration, was, a, clash, of, different, cultures, beliefs, and, working, styles, in, the, previous, few, decades, the, foundations, of, mathematics, had, come, into, question, and, the, need, for, mathematically, rigorous, proofs, was, recognised, hardy, was, an, atheist, and, an, apostle, of, proof, and, mathematical, rigour, whereas, ramanujan, was, a, deeply, religious, man, who, relied, very, strongly, on, his, intuition, and, insights, hardy, tried, his, best, to, fill, the, gaps, in, ramanujan, s, education, and, to, mentor, him, in, the, need, for, formal, proofs, to, support, his, results, without, hindering, his, inspiration, a, conflict, that, neither, found, easy, ramanujan, was, awarded, a, bachelor, of, arts, by, research, degree, the, predecessor, of, the, phd, degree, in, march, 1916, for, his, work, on, highly, composite, numbers, sections, of, the, first, part, of, which, had, been, published, the, preceding, year, in, the, proceedings, of, the, london, mathematical, society, the, paper, was, more, than, 50, pages, long, and, proved, various, properties, of, such, numbers, hardy, disliked, this, topic, area, but, remarked, that, though, it, engaged, with, what, he, called, the, backwater, of, mathematics, in, it, ramanujan, displayed, extraordinary, mastery, over, the, algebra, of, inequalities, on, 6, december, 1917, ramanujan, was, elected, to, the, london, mathematical, society, on, 2, may, 1918, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, the, second, indian, admitted, after, ardaseer, cursetjee, in, 1841, at, age, 31, ramanujan, was, one, of, the, youngest, fellows, in, the, royal, society, s, history, he, was, elected, for, his, investigation, in, elliptic, functions, and, the, theory, of, numbers, on, 13, october, 1918, he, was, the, first, indian, to, be, elected, a, fellow, of, trinity, college, cambridge, ramanujan, had, numerous, health, problems, throughout, his, life, his, health, worsened, in, england, possibly, he, was, also, less, resilient, due, to, the, difficulty, of, keeping, to, the, strict, dietary, requirements, of, his, religion, there, and, because, of, wartime, rationing, in, 1914, 18, he, was, diagnosed, with, tuberculosis, and, a, severe, vitamin, deficiency, and, confined, to, a, sanatorium, he, attempted, suicide, in, late, 1917, or, early, 1918, by, jumping, on, the, tracks, of, a, london, underground, station, scotland, yard, arrested, him, for, attempting, suicide, which, was, a, crime, but, released, him, after, hardy, intervened, in, 1919, ramanujan, returned, to, kumbakonam, madras, presidency, where, he, died, in, 1920, aged, 32, after, his, death, his, brother, tirunarayanan, compiled, ramanujan, s, remaining, handwritten, notes, consisting, of, formulae, on, singular, moduli, hypergeometric, series, and, continued, fractions, in, his, last, days, though, in, severe, pain, he, continued, doing, his, mathematics, filling, sheet, after, sheet, with, numbers, janaki, ammal, recounts, ramanujan, s, widow, smt, janaki, ammal, moved, to, bombay, in, 1931, she, returned, to, madras, and, settled, in, triplicane, where, she, supported, herself, on, a, pension, from, madras, university, and, income, from, tailoring, in, 1950, she, adopted, a, son, w, narayanan, who, eventually, became, an, officer, of, the, state, bank, of, india, and, raised, a, family, in, her, later, years, she, was, granted, a, lifetime, pension, from, ramanujan, s, former, employer, the, madras, port, trust, and, pensions, from, among, others, the, indian, national, science, academy, and, the, state, governments, of, tamil, nadu, andhra, pradesh, and, west, bengal, she, continued, to, cherish, ramanujan, s, memory, and, was, active, in, efforts, to, increase, his, public, recognition, prominent, mathematicians, including, george, andrews, bruce, c, berndt, and, b, la, bollob, s, made, it, a, point, to, visit, her, while, in, india, she, died, at, her, triplicane, residence, in, 1994, a, 1994, analysis, of, ramanujan, s, medical, records, and, symptoms, by, d, a, b, young, concluded, that, his, medical, symptoms, including, his, past, relapses, fevers, and, hepatic, conditions, were, much, closer, to, those, resulting, from, hepatic, amoebiasis, an, illness, then, widespread, in, madras, than, tuberculosis, he, had, two, episodes, of, dysentery, before, he, left, india, when, not, properly, treated, amoebic, dysentery, can, lie, dormant, for, years, and, lead, to, hepatic, amoebiasis, whose, diagnosis, was, not, then, well, established, at, the, time, if, properly, diagnosed, amoebiasis, was, a, treatable, and, often, curable, disease, british, soldiers, who, contracted, it, during, the, first, world, war, were, being, successfully, cured, of, amoebiasis, around, the, time, ramanujan, left, england, while, asleep, i, had, an, unusual, experience, there, was, a, red, screen, formed, by, flowing, blood, as, it, were, i, was, observing, it, suddenly, a, hand, began, to, write, on, the, screen, i, became, all, attention, that, hand, wrote, a, number, of, elliptic, integrals, they, stuck, to, my, mind, as, soon, as, i, woke, up, i, committed, them, to, writing, srinivasa, ramanujan, ramanujan, has, been, described, as, a, person, of, a, somewhat, shy, and, quiet, disposition, a, dignified, man, with, pleasant, manners, he, lived, a, simple, life, at, cambridge, ramanujan, s, first, indian, biographers, describe, him, as, a, rigorously, orthodox, hindu, he, credited, his, acumen, to, his, family, goddess, namagiri, thayar, goddess, mahalakshmi, of, namakkal, he, looked, to, her, for, inspiration, in, his, work, and, said, he, dreamed, of, blood, drops, that, symbolised, her, consort, narasimha, later, he, had, visions, of, scrolls, of, complex, mathematical, content, unfolding, before, his, eyes, he, often, said, an, equation, for, me, has, no, meaning, unless, it, expresses, a, thought, of, god, hardy, cites, ramanujan, as, remarking, that, all, religions, seemed, equally, true, to, him, hardy, further, argued, that, ramanujan, s, religious, belief, had, been, romanticised, by, westerners, and, overstated, in, reference, to, his, belief, not, practice, by, indian, biographers, at, the, same, time, he, remarked, on, ramanujan, s, strict, vegetarianism, similarly, in, an, interview, with, frontline, berndt, said, many, people, falsely, promulgate, mystical, powers, to, ramanujan, s, mathematical, thinking, it, is, not, true, he, has, meticulously, recorded, every, result, in, his, three, notebooks, further, speculating, that, ramanujan, worked, out, intermediate, results, on, slate, that, he, could, not, afford, the, paper, to, record, more, permanently, berndt, reported, that, janaki, said, in, 1984, that, ramanujan, spent, so, much, of, his, time, on, mathematics, that, he, did, not, go, to, the, temple, that, she, and, her, mother, often, fed, him, because, he, had, no, time, to, eat, and, that, most, of, the, religious, stories, attributed, to, him, originated, with, others, however, his, orthopraxy, was, not, in, doubt, in, mathematics, there, is, a, distinction, between, insight, and, formulating, or, working, through, a, proof, ramanujan, proposed, an, abundance, of, formulae, that, could, be, investigated, later, in, depth, g, h, hardy, said, that, ramanujan, s, discoveries, are, unusually, rich, and, that, there, is, often, more, to, them, than, initially, meets, the, eye, as, a, byproduct, of, his, work, new, directions, of, research, were, opened, up, examples, of, the, most, intriguing, of, these, formulae, include, infinite, series, for, one, of, which, is, given, below, this, result, is, based, on, the, negative, fundamental, discriminant, d, 4, 58, 232, with, class, number, h, d, 2, further, 26390, 5, 7, 13, 58, and, 16, 9801, 396, 2, which, is, related, to, the, fact, that, this, might, be, compared, to, heegner, numbers, which, have, class, number, 1, and, yield, similar, formulae, ramanujan, s, series, for, converges, extraordinarily, rapidly, and, forms, the, basis, of, some, of, the, fastest, algorithms, used, to, calculate, truncating, the, sum, to, the, first, term, also, gives, the, approximation, 9801, 2, 4412, for, which, is, correct, to, six, decimal, places, truncating, it, to, the, first, two, terms, gives, a, value, correct, to, 14, decimal, places, see, also, the, more, general, ramanujan, sato, series, one, of, ramanujan, s, remarkable, capabilities, was, the, rapid, solution, of, problems, illustrated, by, the, following, anecdote, about, an, incident, in, which, p, c, mahalanobis, posed, a, problem, imagine, that, you, are, on, a, street, with, houses, marked, 1, through, n, there, is, a, house, in, between, x, such, that, the, sum, of, the, house, numbers, to, the, left, of, it, equals, the, sum, of, the, house, numbers, to, its, right, if, n, is, between, 50, and, 500, what, are, n, and, x, this, is, a, bivariate, problem, with, multiple, solutions, ramanujan, thought, about, it, and, gave, the, answer, with, a, twist, he, gave, a, continued, fraction, the, unusual, part, was, that, it, was, the, solution, to, the, whole, class, of, problems, mahalanobis, was, astounded, and, asked, how, he, did, it, it, is, simple, the, minute, i, heard, the, problem, i, knew, that, the, answer, was, a, continued, fraction, which, continued, fraction, i, asked, myself, then, the, answer, came, to, my, mind, ramanujan, replied, his, intuition, also, led, him, to, derive, some, previously, unknown, identities, such, as, for, all, such, that, displaystyle, re, theta, pi, and, displaystyle, im, theta, pi, where, z, is, the, gamma, function, and, related, to, a, special, value, of, the, dedekind, eta, function, expanding, into, series, of, powers, and, equating, coefficients, of, 0, 4, and, 8, gives, some, deep, identities, for, the, hyperbolic, secant, in, 1918, hardy, and, ramanujan, studied, the, partition, function, p, n, extensively, they, gave, a, non, convergent, asymptotic, series, that, permits, exact, computation, of, the, number, of, partitions, of, an, integer, in, 1937, hans, rademacher, refined, their, formula, to, find, an, exact, convergent, series, solution, to, this, problem, ramanujan, and, hardy, s, work, in, this, area, gave, rise, to, a, powerful, new, method, for, finding, asymptotic, formulae, called, the, circle, method, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, ramanujan, discovered, mock, theta, functions, for, many, years, these, functions, were, a, mystery, but, they, are, now, known, to, be, the, holomorphic, parts, of, harmonic, weak, maass, forms, although, there, are, numerous, statements, that, could, have, borne, the, name, ramanujan, conjecture, one, was, highly, influential, in, later, work, in, particular, the, connection, of, this, conjecture, with, conjectures, of, andr, weil, in, algebraic, geometry, opened, up, new, areas, of, research, that, ramanujan, conjecture, is, an, assertion, on, the, size, of, the, tau, function, which, has, a, generating, function, as, the, discriminant, modular, form, q, a, typical, cusp, form, in, the, theory, of, modular, forms, it, was, finally, proven, in, 1973, as, a, consequence, of, pierre, deligne, s, proof, of, the, weil, conjectures, the, reduction, step, involved, is, complicated, deligne, won, a, fields, medal, in, 1978, for, that, work, in, his, paper, on, certain, arithmetical, functions, ramanujan, defined, the, so, called, delta, function, whose, coefficients, are, called, n, the, ramanujan, tau, function, he, proved, many, congruences, for, these, numbers, such, as, p, 1, p, 11, mod, 691, for, primes, p, this, congruence, and, others, like, it, that, ramanujan, proved, inspired, jean, pierre, serre, 1954, fields, medalist, to, conjecture, that, there, is, a, theory, of, galois, representations, that, explains, these, congruences, and, more, generally, all, modular, forms, z, is, the, first, example, of, a, modular, form, to, be, studied, in, this, way, deligne, in, his, fields, medal, winning, work, proved, serre, s, conjecture, the, proof, of, fermat, s, last, theorem, proceeds, by, first, reinterpreting, elliptic, curves, and, modular, forms, in, terms, of, these, galois, representations, without, this, theory, there, would, be, no, proof, of, fermat, s, last, theorem, while, still, in, madras, ramanujan, recorded, the, bulk, of, his, results, in, four, notebooks, of, looseleaf, paper, they, were, mostly, written, up, without, any, derivations, this, is, probably, the, origin, of, the, misapprehension, that, ramanujan, was, unable, to, prove, his, results, and, simply, thought, up, the, final, result, directly, mathematician, bruce, c, berndt, in, his, review, of, these, notebooks, and, ramanujan, s, work, says, that, ramanujan, most, certainly, was, able, to, prove, most, of, his, results, but, chose, not, to, record, the, proofs, in, his, notes, this, may, have, been, for, any, number, of, reasons, since, paper, was, very, expensive, ramanujan, did, most, of, his, work, and, perhaps, his, proofs, on, slate, after, which, he, transferred, the, final, results, to, paper, at, the, time, slates, were, commonly, used, by, mathematics, students, in, the, madras, presidency, he, was, also, quite, likely, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, style, of, g, s, carr, s, book, which, stated, results, without, proofs, it, is, also, possible, that, ramanujan, considered, his, work, to, be, for, his, personal, interest, alone, and, therefore, recorded, only, the, results, the, first, notebook, has, 351, pages, with, 16, somewhat, organised, chapters, and, some, unorganised, material, the, second, has, 256, pages, in, 21, chapters, and, 100, unorganised, pages, and, the, third, 33, unorganised, pages, the, results, in, his, notebooks, inspired, numerous, papers, by, later, mathematicians, trying, to, prove, what, he, had, found, hardy, himself, wrote, papers, exploring, material, from, ramanujan, s, work, as, did, g, n, watson, b, m, wilson, and, bruce, berndt, in, 1976, george, andrews, rediscovered, a, fourth, notebook, with, 87, unorganised, pages, the, so, called, lost, notebook, the, number, 1729, is, known, as, the, hardy, ramanujan, number, after, a, famous, visit, by, hardy, to, see, ramanujan, at, a, hospital, in, hardy, s, words, i, remember, once, going, to, see, him, when, he, was, ill, at, putney, i, had, ridden, in, taxi, cab, number, 1729, and, remarked, that, the, number, seemed, to, me, rather, a, dull, one, and, that, i, hoped, it, was, not, an, unfavorable, omen, no, he, replied, it, is, a, very, interesting, number, it, is, the, smallest, number, expressible, as, the, sum, of, two, cubes, in, two, different, ways, immediately, before, this, anecdote, hardy, quoted, littlewood, as, saying, every, positive, integer, was, one, of, personal, friends, the, two, different, ways, are, generalisations, of, this, idea, have, created, the, notion, of, taxicab, numbers, of, course, we, re, always, hoping, that, s, one, reason, i, always, read, letters, that, come, in, from, obscure, places, and, are, written, in, an, illegible, scrawl, i, always, hope, it, might, be, from, another, ramanujan, freeman, dyson, on, how, another, such, genius, might, appear, anywhere, in, his, obituary, of, ramanujan, written, for, nature, in, 1920, hardy, observed, that, ramanujan, s, work, primarily, involved, fields, less, known, even, among, other, pure, mathematicians, concluding, his, insight, into, formulae, was, quite, amazing, and, altogether, beyond, anything, i, have, met, with, in, any, european, mathematician, it, is, perhaps, useless, to, speculate, as, to, his, history, had, he, been, introduced, to, modern, ideas, and, methods, at, sixteen, instead, of, at, twenty, six, it, is, not, extravagant, to, suppose, that, he, might, have, become, the, greatest, mathematician, of, his, time, what, he, actually, did, is, wonderful, enough, when, the, researches, which, his, work, has, suggested, have, been, completed, it, will, probably, seem, a, good, deal, more, wonderful, than, it, does, to, day, hardy, further, said, he, combined, a, power, of, generalisation, a, feeling, for, form, and, a, capacity, for, rapid, modification, of, his, hypotheses, that, were, often, really, startling, and, made, him, in, his, own, peculiar, field, without, a, rival, in, his, day, the, limitations, of, his, knowledge, were, as, startling, as, its, profundity, here, was, a, man, who, could, work, out, modular, equations, and, theorems, to, orders, unheard, of, whose, mastery, of, continued, fractions, was, beyond, that, of, any, mathematician, in, the, world, who, had, found, for, himself, the, functional, equation, of, the, zeta, function, and, the, dominant, terms, of, many, of, the, most, famous, problems, in, the, analytic, theory, of, numbers, and, yet, he, had, never, heard, of, a, doubly, periodic, function, or, of, cauchy, s, theorem, and, had, indeed, but, the, vaguest, idea, of, what, a, function, of, a, complex, variable, was, as, an, example, hardy, commented, on, 15, theorems, in, the, first, letter, of, those, the, first, 13, are, correct, and, insightful, the, 14th, is, incorrect, but, insightful, and, the, 15th, is, correct, but, misleading, 14, the, coefficient, of, x, n, displaystyle, x, n, in, 1, 2, x, 2, x, 4, 2, x, 9, 1, displaystyle, left, 1, 2x, 2x, 4, 2x, 9, cdots, right, 1, is, the, integer, nearest, to, 1, 4, n, cosh, n, sinh, n, n, displaystyle, frac, 1, 4n, left, cosh, pi, sqrt, n, frac, sinh, pi, sqrt, n, pi, sqrt, n, right, this, was, one, of, the, most, fruitful, he, ever, made, since, it, ended, by, leading, us, to, all, our, joint, work, on, partitions, when, asked, about, the, methods, ramanujan, used, to, arrive, at, his, solutions, hardy, said, they, were, arrived, at, by, a, process, of, mingled, argument, intuition, and, induction, of, which, he, was, entirely, unable, to, give, any, coherent, account, he, also, said, that, he, had, never, met, his, equal, and, can, compare, him, only, with, euler, or, jacobi, hardy, thought, ramanujan, worked, in, a, 19th, century, style, where, arriving, at, correct, formulas, was, more, important, than, systematic, formal, theories, hardy, thought, his, achievements, were, greatest, in, algebra, especially, hypergeometric, series, and, continued, fractions, it, is, possible, that, the, great, days, of, formulas, are, finished, and, that, ramanujan, ought, to, have, been, born, 100, years, ago, but, he, was, by, far, the, greatest, formalist, of, his, time, there, have, been, a, good, many, more, important, and, i, suppose, one, must, say, greater, mathematicians, than, ramanujan, during, the, last, 50, years, but, not, one, who, could, stand, up, to, him, on, his, own, ground, playing, the, game, of, which, he, knew, the, rules, he, could, give, any, mathematician, in, the, world, fifteen, he, discovered, fewer, new, things, in, analysis, possibly, because, he, lacked, the, formal, education, and, did, not, find, books, to, learn, it, from, but, rediscovered, many, results, including, the, prime, number, theorem, in, analysis, he, worked, on, the, elliptic, functions, and, the, analytic, theory, of, numbers, in, analytic, number, theory, he, was, as, imaginative, as, usual, but, much, of, what, he, imagined, was, wrong, hardy, blamed, this, on, the, inherent, difficulty, of, analytic, number, theory, where, imagination, had, led, many, great, mathematicians, astray, in, analytic, number, theory, rigorous, proof, is, more, important, than, imagination, the, opposite, of, ramanujan, s, style, his, one, great, failure, is, that, he, knew, nothing, at, all, about, the, theory, of, analytic, functions, littlewood, reportedly, said, that, helping, ramanujan, catch, up, with, european, mathematics, beyond, what, was, available, in, india, was, very, difficult, because, each, new, point, mentioned, to, ramanujan, caused, him, to, produce, original, ideas, that, prevented, littlewood, from, continuing, the, lesson, k, srinivasa, rao, has, said, as, for, his, place, in, the, world, of, mathematics, we, quote, bruce, c, berndt, paul, erd, s, has, passed, on, to, us, hardy, s, personal, ratings, of, mathematicians, suppose, that, we, rate, mathematicians, on, the, basis, of, pure, talent, on, a, scale, from, 0, to, 100, hardy, gave, himself, a, score, of, 25, j, e, littlewood, 30, david, hilbert, 80, and, ramanujan, 100, during, a, may, 2011, lecture, at, iit, madras, berndt, said, that, over, the, last, 40, years, as, nearly, all, of, ramanujan, s, conjectures, had, been, proven, there, had, been, greater, appreciation, of, ramanujan, s, work, and, brilliance, and, that, ramanujan, s, work, was, now, pervading, many, areas, of, modern, mathematics, and, physics, the, year, after, his, death, nature, listed, ramanujan, among, other, distinguished, scientists, and, mathematicians, on, a, calendar, of, scientific, pioneers, who, had, achieved, eminence, ramanujan, s, home, state, of, tamil, nadu, celebrates, 22, december, ramanujan, s, birthday, as, state, it, day, stamps, picturing, ramanujan, were, issued, by, the, government, of, india, in, 1962, 2011, 2012, and, 2016, since, ramanujan, s, centennial, year, his, birthday, 22, december, has, been, annually, celebrated, as, ramanujan, day, by, the, government, arts, college, kumbakonam, where, he, studied, and, at, the, iit, madras, in, chennai, the, international, centre, for, theoretical, physics, ictp, has, created, a, prize, in, ramanujan, s, name, for, young, mathematicians, from, developing, countries, in, cooperation, with, the, international, mathematical, union, which, nominates, members, of, the, prize, committee, sastra, university, a, private, university, based, in, tamil, nadu, has, instituted, the, sastra, ramanujan, prize, of, us, 10, 000, to, be, given, annually, to, a, mathematician, not, exceeding, age, 32, for, outstanding, contributions, in, an, area, of, mathematics, influenced, by, ramanujan, based, on, the, recommendations, of, a, committee, appointed, by, the, university, grants, commission, ugc, government, of, india, the, srinivasa, ramanujan, centre, established, by, sastra, has, been, declared, an, off, campus, centre, under, the, ambit, of, sastra, university, house, of, ramanujan, mathematics, a, museum, of, ramanujan, s, life, and, work, is, also, on, this, campus, sastra, purchased, and, renovated, the, house, where, ramanujan, lived, at, kumabakonam, in, 2011, on, the, 125th, anniversary, of, his, birth, the, indian, government, declared, that, 22, december, will, be, celebrated, every, year, as, national, mathematics, day, then, indian, prime, minister, manmohan, singh, also, declared, that, 2012, would, be, celebrated, as, national, mathematics, year, and, 22, december, as, national, mathematics, day, of, india, ramanujan, it, city, is, an, information, technology, it, special, economic, zone, sez, in, chennai, that,
