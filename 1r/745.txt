monastery, while, the, rest, of, the, family, s, sons, pursued, military, careers, the, family, intended, for, thomas, to, follow, his, uncle, into, the, abbacy, this, would, have, been, a, normal, career, path, for, a, younger, son, of, southern, italian, nobility, at, the, age, of, five, thomas, began, his, early, education, at, monte, cassino, but, after, the, military, conflict, between, emperor, frederick, ii, and, pope, gregory, ix, spilt, into, the, abbey, in, early, 1239, landulf, and, theodora, had, thomas, enrolled, at, the, studium, generale, university, established, by, frederick, in, naples, there, his, teacher, in, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and, music, was, petrus, de, ibernia, it, was, at, this, university, that, thomas, was, presumably, introduced, to, aristotle, averroes, and, maimonides, all, of, whom, would, influence, his, theological, philosophy, during, his, study, at, naples, thomas, also, came, under, the, influence, of, john, of, st, julian, a, dominican, preacher, in, naples, who, was, part, of, the, active, effort, by, the, dominican, order, to, recruit, devout, followers, at, the, age, of, nineteen, thomas, resolved, to, join, the, dominican, order, his, change, of, heart, however, did, not, please, his, family, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, theodora, s, interference, in, thomas, s, choice, the, dominicans, arranged, to, move, thomas, to, rome, and, from, rome, to, paris, however, while, on, his, journey, to, rome, per, theodora, s, instructions, his, brothers, seized, him, as, he, was, drinking, from, a, spring, and, took, him, back, to, his, parents, at, the, castle, of, monte, san, giovanni, campano, thomas, was, held, prisoner, for, almost, one, year, in, the, family, castles, at, monte, san, giovanni, and, roccasecca, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, him, from, assuming, the, dominican, habit, and, to, push, him, into, renouncing, his, new, aspiration, political, concerns, prevented, the, pope, from, ordering, thomas, s, release, which, had, the, effect, of, extending, thomas, s, detention, thomas, passed, this, time, of, trial, tutoring, his, sisters, and, communicating, with, members, of, the, dominican, order, family, members, became, desperate, to, dissuade, thomas, who, remained, determined, to, join, the, dominicans, at, one, point, two, of, his, brothers, resorted, to, the, measure, of, hiring, a, prostitute, to, seduce, him, presumably, because, sexual, temptation, might, dissuade, him, from, a, life, of, celibacy, according, to, the, official, records, for, his, canonization, thomas, drove, her, away, wielding, a, burning, log, with, which, he, inscribed, a, cross, onto, the, wall, and, fell, into, a, mystical, ecstasy, two, angels, appeared, to, him, as, he, slept, and, said, behold, we, gird, thee, by, the, command, of, god, with, the, girdle, of, chastity, which, henceforth, will, never, be, imperilled, what, human, strength, can, not, obtain, is, now, bestowed, upon, thee, as, a, celestial, gift, from, then, onwards, thomas, was, given, the, grace, of, perfect, chastity, by, christ, a, girdle, he, wore, till, the, end, of, his, life, the, girdle, was, given, to, the, ancient, monastery, of, vercelli, in, piedmont, and, is, now, at, chieri, near, turin, by, 1244, seeing, that, all, her, attempts, to, dissuade, thomas, had, failed, theodora, sought, to, save, the, family, s, dignity, arranging, for, thomas, to, escape, at, night, through, his, window, in, her, mind, a, secret, escape, from, detention, was, less, damaging, than, an, open, surrender, to, the, dominicans, thomas, was, sent, first, to, naples, and, then, to, rome, to, meet, johannes, von, wildeshausen, the, master, general, of, the, dominican, order, in, 1245, thomas, was, sent, to,

college, of, st, james, in, paris, when, albertus, was, sent, by, his, superiors, to, teach, at, the, new, studium, generale, at, cologne, in, 1248, thomas, followed, him, declining, pope, innocent, iv, s, offer, to, appoint, him, abbot, of, monte, cassino, as, a, dominican, albertus, then, appointed, the, reluctant, thomas, magister, studentium, because, thomas, was, quiet, and, did, not, speak, much, some, of, his, fellow, students, thought, he, was, slow, but, albertus, prophetically, exclaimed, you, call, him, the, dumb, ox, but, in, his, teaching, he, will, one, day, produce, such, a, bellowing, that, it, will, be, heard, throughout, the, world, thomas, taught, in, cologne, as, an, apprentice, professor, baccalaureus, biblicus, instructing, students, on, the, books, of, the, old,

tantum, ergo, and, panis, angelicus, modern, scholarship, has, confirmed, that, thomas, was, indeed, the, author, of, these, texts, a, point, that, some, had, contested, in, february, 1265, the, newly, elected, pope, clement, iv, summoned, thomas, to, rome, to, serve, as, papal, theologian, this, same, year, he, was, ordered, by, the, dominican, chapter, of, agnani, to, teach, at, the,

sort, no, arts, no, philosophy, only, simple, convent, schools, with, their, basic, courses, in, theology, for, resident, friars, were, functioning, in, tuscany, and, the, meridionale, during, the, first, several, decades, of, the, order, s, life, the, new, studium, provinciale, at, santa, sabina, was, to, be, a, more, advanced, school, for, the, province, tolomeo, da, lucca, an, associate, and, early, biographer, of, thomas, tells, us, that, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, thomas, taught, the, full, range, of, philosophical, subjects, both, moral, and, natural, while, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, provinciale, thomas, began, his, most, famous, work, the, summa, theologiae, which, he, conceived, specifically, suited, to, beginner, students, because, a, doctor, of, catholic, truth, ought, not, only, to, teach, the, proficient, but, to, him, pertains, also, to, instruct, beginners, as, the, apostle, says, in, 1, corinthians, 3, 1, 2, as, to, infants, in, christ, i, gave, you, milk, to, drink, not, meat, our, proposed, intention, in, this, work, is, to, convey, those, things, that, pertain, to, the, christian, religion, in, a, way, that, is, fitting, to, the, instruction, of, beginners, while, there, he, also, wrote, a, variety, of, other, works, like, his, unfinished, compendium, theologiae, and, responsio, ad, fr, ioannem, vercellensem, de, articulis, 108, sumptis, ex, opere, petri, de, tarentasia, reply, to, brother, john, of, vercelli, regarding, 108, articles, drawn, from, the, work, of, peter, of, tarentaise, in, his, position, as, head, of, the, studium, thomas, conducted, a, series, of, important, disputations, on, the, power, of, god, which, he, compiled, into, his, de, potentia, nicholas, brunacci, was, among, thomas, s, students, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, provinciale, and, later, at, the, paris, studium, generale, in, november, 1268, he, was, with, thomas, and, his, associate, and, secretary, reginald, of, piperno, as, they, left, viterbo, on, their, way, to, paris, to, begin, the, academic, year, another, student, of, thomas, s, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, provinciale, was, blessed, tommasello, da, perugia, thomas, remained, at, the, studium, at, santa, sabina, from, 1265, until, he, was, called, back, to, paris, in, 1268, for, a, second, teaching, regency, with, his, departure, for, paris, in, 1268, and, the, passage, of, time, the, pedagogical, activities, of, the, studium, provinciale, at, santa, sabina, were, divided, between, two, campuses, a, new, convent, of, the, order, at, the, church, of, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, began, in, 1255, as, a, community, for, women, converts, but, grew, rapidly, in, size, and, importance, after, being, given, over, to, the, dominicans, friars, in, 1275, in, 1288, the, theology, component, of, the, provincial, curriculum, for, the, education, of, the, friars, was, relocated, from, the, santa, sabina, studium, provinciale, to, the, studium, conventuale, at, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, which, was, redesignated, as, a, studium, particularis, theologiae, this, studium, was, transformed, in, the, 16th, century, into, the, college, of, saint, thomas, latin, collegium, divi, thom, in, the, 20th, century, the, college, was, relocated, to, the, convent, of, saints, dominic, and, sixtus, and, was, transformed, into, the, pontifical, university, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, aka, the, angelicum, in, 1268, the, dominican, order, assigned, thomas, to, be, regent, master, at, the, university, of, paris, for, a, second, time, a, position, he, held, until, the, spring, of, 1272, part, of, the, reason, for, this, sudden, reassignment, appears, to, have, arisen, from, the, rise, of, averroism, or, radical, aristotelianism, in, the, universities, in, response, to, these, perceived, errors, thomas, wrote, two, works, one, of, them, being, de, unitate, intellectus, contra, averroistas, on, the, unity, of, intellect, against, the, averroists, in, which, he, reprimands, averroism, as, incompatible, with, christian, doctrine, during, his, second, regency, he, finished, the, second, part, of, the, summa, and, wrote, de, virtutibus, and, de, aeternitate, mundi, contra, murmurantes, on, the, eternity, of, the, world, against, grumblers, the, latter, of, which, dealt, with, controversial, averroist, and, aristotelian, beginninglessness, of, the, world, disputes, with, some, important, franciscans, conspired, to, make, his, second, regency, much, more, difficult, and, troubled, than, the, first, a, year, before, thomas, re, assumed, the, regency, at, the, 1266, 67, paris, disputations, franciscan, master, william, of, baglione, accused, thomas, of, encouraging, averroists, most, likely, counting, him, as, one, of, the, blind, leaders, of, the, blind, eleonore, stump, says, it, has, also, been, persuasively, argued, that, thomas, aquinas, s, de, aeternitate, mundi, was, directed, in, particular, against, his, franciscan, colleague, in, theology, john, pecham, thomas, was, deeply, disturbed, by, the, spread, of, averroism, and, was, angered, when, he, discovered, siger, of, brabant, teaching, averroistic, interpretations, of, aristotle, to, parisian, students, on, 10, december, 1270, the, bishop, of, paris, tienne, tempier, issued, an, edict, condemning, thirteen, aristotelian, and, averroistic, propositions, as, heretical, and, excommunicating, anyone, who, continued, to, support, them, many, in, the, ecclesiastical, community, the, so, called, augustinians, were, fearful, that, this, introduction, of, aristotelianism, and, the, more, extreme, averroism, might, somehow, contaminate, the, purity, of, the, christian, faith, in, what, appears, to, be, an, attempt, to, counteract, the, growing, fear, of, aristotelian, thought, thomas, conducted, a, series, of, disputations, between, 1270, and, 1272, de, virtutibus, in, communi, on, virtues, in, general, de, virtutibus, cardinalibus, on, cardinal, virtues, and, de, spe, on, hope, in, 1272, thomas, took, leave, from, the, university, of, paris, when, the, dominicans, from, his, home, province, called, upon, him, to, establish, a, studium, generale, wherever, he, liked, and, staff, it, as, he, pleased, he, chose, to, establish, the, institution, in, naples, and, moved, there, to, take, his, post, as, regent, master, he, took, his, time, at, naples, to, work, on, the, third, part, of, the, summa, while, giving, lectures, on, various, religious, topics, he, also, preached, to, the, people, of, naples, every, day, in, lent, of, 1273, these, sermons, on, the, commandments, the, creed, the, our, father, and, hail, mary, were, very, popular, thomas, has, been, traditionally, ascribed, with, the, ability, to, levitate, and, as, having, had, various, mystical, experiences, for, example, g, k, chesterton, wrote, that, his, experiences, included, well, attested, cases, of, levitation, in, ecstasy, and, the, blessed, virgin, appeared, to, him, comforting, him, with, the, welcome, news, that, he, would, never, be, a, bishop, it, is, traditionally, held, that, on, one, occasion, in, 1273, at, the, dominican, convent, of, naples, in, the, chapel, of, saint, nicholas, after, matins, thomas, lingered, and, was, seen, by, the, sacristan, domenic, of, caserta, to, be, levitating, in, prayer, with, tears, before, an, icon, of, the, crucified, christ, christ, said, to, thomas, you, have, written, well, of, me, thomas, what, reward, would, you, have, for, your, labor, thomas, responded, nothing, but, you, lord, on, 6, december, 1273, another, mystical, experience, took, place, while, thomas, was, celebrating, mass, he, experienced, an, unusually, long, ecstasy, because, of, what, he, saw, he, abandoned, his, routine, and, refused, to, dictate, to, his, socius, reginald, of, piperno, when, reginald, begged, him, to, get, back, to, work, thomas, replied, reginald, i, cannot, because, all, that, i, have, written, seems, like, straw, to, me, mihi, videtur, ut, palea, as, a, result, the, summa, theologica, would, remain, uncompleted, what, exactly, triggered, thomas, s, change, in, behaviour, is, believed, by, some, to, have, been, some, kind, of, supernatural, experience, of, god, after, taking, to, his, bed, however, he, did, recover, some, strength, in, 1274, pope, gregory, x, summoned, thomas, to, attend, the, second, council, of, lyon, the, council, was, to, open, 1, may, 1274, and, it, was, gregory, s, attempt, to, try, to, heal, the, great, schism, of, 1054, which, had, divided, the, catholic, church, in, the, west, from, the, eastern, orthodox, church, at, the, meeting, thomas, s, work, for, pope, urban, iv, concerning, the, greeks, contra, errores, graecorum, was, to, be, presented, however, on, his, way, to, the, council, riding, on, a, donkey, along, the, appian, way, he, struck, his, head, on, the, branch, of, a, fallen, tree, and, became, seriously, ill, again, he, was, then, quickly, escorted, to, monte, cassino, to, convalesce, after, resting, for, a, while, he, set, out, again, but, stopped, at, the, cistercian, fossanova, abbey, after, again, falling, ill, the, monks, nursed, him, for, several, days, and, as, he, received, his, last, rites, he, prayed, i, have, written, and, taught, much, about, this, very, holy, body, and, about, the, other, sacraments, in, the, faith, of, christ, and, about, the, holy, roman, church, to, whose, correction, i, expose, and, submit, everything, i, have, written, he, died, on, 7, march, 1274, while, giving, commentary, on, the, song, of, songs, in, 1277, tienne, tempier, the, same, bishop, of, paris, who, had, issued, the, condemnation, of, 1270, issued, another, more, extensive, condemnation, one, aim, of, this, condemnation, was, to, clarify, that, god, s, absolute, power, transcended, any, principles, of, logic, that, aristotle, or, averroes, might, place, on, it, more, specifically, it, contained, a, list, of, 219, propositions, including, twenty, thomistic, propositions, that, the, bishop, had, determined, to, violate, the, omnipotence, of, god, the, inclusion, of, the, thomistic, propositions, badly, damaged, thomas, s, reputation, for, many, years, by, the, 1300s, however, thomas, s, theology, had, begun, its, rise, to, prestige, in, the, divine, comedy, completed, c, 1321, dante, sees, the, glorified, soul, of, thomas, in, the, heaven, of, the, sun, with, the, other, great, exemplars, of, religious, wisdom, dante, asserts, that, thomas, died, by, poisoning, on, the, order, of, charles, of, anjou, villani, cites, this, belief, and, the, anonimo, fiorentino, describes, the, crime, and, its, motive, but, the, historian, ludovico, antonio, muratori, reproduces, the, account, made, by, one, of, thomas, s, friends, and, this, version, of, the, story, gives, no, hint, of, foul, play, when, the, devil, s, advocate, at, his, canonization, process, objected, that, there, were, no, miracles, one, of, the, cardinals, answered, tot, miraculis, quot, articulis, there, are, as, many, miracles, in, his, life, as, articles, in, his, summa, fifty, years, after, thomas, s, death, on, 18, july, 1323, pope, john, xxii, seated, in, avignon, pronounced, thomas, a, saint, a, monastery, at, naples, near, naples, cathedral,

churches, of, the, anglican, communion, with, a, lesser, festival, on, 28, january, the, catholic, church, honours, thomas, aquinas, as, a, saint, and, regards, him, as, the, model, teacher, for, those, studying, for, the, priesthood, in, modern, times, under, papal, directives, the, study, of, his, works, was, long, used, as, a, core, of, the, required, program, of, study, for, those, seeking, ordination, as, priests, or, deacons, as, well, as, for, those, in, religious, formation, and, for, other, students, of, the, sacred, disciplines, philosophy, catholic, theology, church,

fathers, ambrose, augustine, of, hippo, jerome, and, gregory, at, the, council, of, trent, thomas, had, the, honour, of, having, his, summa, theologiae, placed, on, the, altar, alongside, the, bible, and, the, decretals, this, happened, within, the, historical, timeframe, of, the, second, scholasticism, a, trend, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, that, saw, renewed, interest, in, the, works, of, scholars, of, the, 12th, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, in, spite, of, humanism, as, a, contrary, trend, second, scholasticism, gave, special, emphasis, to, the, works, of, thomas, aquinas, and, john, duns, scotus, with, more, franciscans, following, duns, scotus, and, more, dominicans, and, carmelites, following, thomas, thomists, or, those, following, thomas, included, francisco, de, vitoria, thomas, cajetan, franciscus, ferrariensis, domingo, de, soto, domingo, b, ez, jo, o, poinsot, the, complutenses, and, others, during, the, 19th, century, a, movement, that, came, to, be, known, as, neo, scholasticism, revived, catholic, scholarly, interest, in, scholasticism, generally, and, thomas, in, particular, as, well, as, the, work, of, the, thomists, of, second, scholasticism, the, systematic, work, of, thomas, was, valued, in, part, as, a, foundation, for, arguing, against, early, modern, philosophers, and, modernist, theologians, a, good, example, is, aeterni, patris, the, 1879, encyclical, by, pope, leo, xiii, stating, that, thomas, s, theology, was, a, definitive, exposition, of, catholic, doctrine, leo, xiii, directed, the, clergy, to, take, the, teachings, of, thomas, as, the, basis, of, their, theological, positions, leo, also, decreed, that, all, catholic, seminaries, and, universities, must, teach, thomas, s, doctrines, and, where, thomas, did, not, speak, on, a, topic, the, teachers, were, urged, to, teach, conclusions, that, were, reconcilable, with, his, thinking, in, 1880, thomas, aquinas, was, declared, the, patron, saint, of, all, catholic, educational, establishments, similarly, in, pascendi, dominici, gregis, the, 1907, encyclical, by, pope, pius, x, the, pope, said, let, professors, remember, that, they, cannot, set, st, thomas, aside, especially, in, metaphysical, questions, without, grave, detriment, on, 29, june, 1923, on, the, sixth, centenary, of, his, canonisation, pope, pius, xi, dedicated, the, encyclical, studiorum, ducem, to, him, in, response, to, neo, scholasticism, catholic, scholars, who, were, more, sympathetic, to, modernity, gained, influence, during, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, nouvelle, th, ologie, movement, meaning, new, theology, it, was, closely, associated, with, a, movement, of, ressourcement, meaning, back, to, sources, echoing, the, phrase, ad, fontes, used, by, renaissance, humanists, although, nouvelle, th, ologie, disagreed, with, neo, scholasticism, about, modernity, arguing, that, theology, could, learn, much, from, modern, philosophy, and, science, their, interest, in, also, studying, old, sources, meant, that, they, found, common, ground, in, their, appreciation, of, scholastics, like, thomas, aquinas, the, second, vatican, council, generally, adopted, the, stance, of, the, theologians, of, nouvelle, th, ologie, but, the, importance, of, thomas, was, a, point, of, agreement, the, council, s, decree, optatam, totius, on, the, formation, of, priests, at, no, 15, proposed, an, authentic, interpretation, of, the, popes, teaching, on, thomism, requiring, that, the, theological, formation, of, priests, be, done, with, thomas, aquinas, as, teacher, general, catholic, appreciation, for, thomas, has, remained, strong, in, the, 20th, century, as, seen, in, the, praise, offered, by, pope, john, paul, ii, in, the, 1998, encyclical, fides, et, ratio, and, similarly, in, pope, benedict, xv, s, 1921, encyclical, fausto, appetente, die, some, modern, ethicists, within, the, catholic, church, notably, alasdair, macintyre, and, outside, it, notably, philippa, foot, have, recently, commented, on, the, possible, use, of, thomas, s, virtue, ethics, as, a, way, of, avoiding, utilitarianism, or, kantian, sense, of, duty, called, deontology, through, the, work, of, twentieth, century, philosophers, such, as, elizabeth, anscombe, especially, in, her, book, intention, thomas, s, principle, of, double, effect, specifically, and, his, theory, of, intentional, activity, generally, have, been, influential, the, cognitive, neuroscientist, walter, freeman, has, proposed, that, thomism, is, the, philosophical, system, explaining, cognition, that, is, most, compatible, with, neurodynamics, henry, adams, s, mont, saint, michel, and, chartres, ends, with, a, culminating, chapter, on, thomas, in, which, adams, calls, thomas, an, artist, and, constructs, an, extensive, analogy, between, the, design, of, thomas, s, church, intellectual, and, that, of, the, gothic, cathedrals, of, that, period, erwin, panofsky, later, would, echo, these, views, in, gothic, architecture, and, scholasticism, 1951, thomas, s, aesthetic, theories, especially, the, concept, of, claritas, deeply, influenced, the, literary, practice, of, modernist, writer, james, joyce, who, used, to, extol, thomas, as, being, second, only, to, aristotle, among, western, philosophers, joyce, refers, to, thomas, s, doctrines, in, elementa, philosophiae, ad, mentem, d, thomae, aquinatis, doctoris, angelici, 1898, of, girolamo, maria, mancini, professor, of, theology, at, the, collegium, divi, thomae, de, urbe, for, example, mancini, s, elementa, is, referred, to, in, joyce, s, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, the, influence, of, thomas, s, aesthetics, also, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, the, italian, semiotician, umberto, eco, who, wrote, an, essay, on, aesthetic, ideas, in, thomas, published, in, 1956, and, republished, in, 1988, in, a, revised, edition, twentieth, century, philosopher, bertrand, russell, criticized, thomas, s, philosophy, stating, that, he, does, not, like, the, platonic, socrates, set, out, to, follow, wherever, the, argument, may, lead, he, is, not, engaged, in, an, inquiry, the, result, of, which, it, is, impossible, to, know, in, advance, before, he, begins, to, philosophize, he, already, knows, the, truth, it, is, declared, in, the, catholic, faith, if, he, can, find, apparently, rational, arguments, for, some, parts, of, the, faith, so, much, the, better, if, he, cannot, he, need, only, fall, back, on, revelation, the, finding, of, arguments, for, a, conclusion, given, in, advance, is, not, philosophy, but, special, pleading, i, cannot, therefore, feel, that, he, deserves, to, be, put, on, a, level, with, the, best, philosophers, either, of, greece, or, of, modern, times, this, criticism, is, illustrated, with, the, following, example, according, to, russell, thomas, advocates, the, indissolubility, of, marriage, on, the, ground, that, the, father, is, useful, in, the, education, of, the, children, a, because, he, is, more, rational, than, the, mother, b, because, being, stronger, he, is, better, able, to, inflict, physical, punishment, even, though, modern, approaches, to, education, do, not, support, these, views, no, follower, of, saint, thomas, would, on, that, account, cease, to, believe, in, lifelong, monogamy, because, the, real, grounds, of, belief, are, not, those, which, are, alleged, thomas, aquinas, viewed, theology, the, sacred, doctrine, as, a, science, by, which, he, meant, a, field, of, study, in, which, humanity, could, learn, more, by, its, own, efforts, as, opposed, to, being, totally, dependent, on, having, divine, revelation, planted, into, our, minds, for, thomas, the, raw, material, data, of, this, field, consists, of, written, scripture, and, the, tradition, of, the, catholic, church, these, sources, of, data, were, produced, by, the, self, revelation, of, god, to, individuals, and, groups, of, people, throughout, history, faith, and, reason, being, distinct, but, related, are, the, two, primary, tools, for, processing, the, data, of, theology, thomas, believed, both, were, necessary, or, rather, that, the, confluence, of, both, was, necessary, for, one, to, obtain, true, knowledge, of, god, thomas, blended, greek, philosophy, and, christian, doctrine, by, suggesting, that, rational, thinking, and, the, study, of, nature, like, revelation, were, valid, ways, to, understand, truths, pertaining, to, god, according, to, thomas, god, reveals, himself, through, nature, so, to, study, nature, is, to, study, god, the, ultimate, goals, of, theology, in, thomas, s, mind, are, to, use, reason, to, grasp, the, truth, about, god, and, to, experience, salvation, through, that, truth, the, central, thought, is, gratia, non, tollit, naturam, sed, perficit, grace, does, not, destroy, nature, but, perfects, it, thomas, believed, that, truth, is, known, through, reason, rationality, natural, revelation, and, faith, supernatural, revelation, supernatural, revelation, has, its, origin, in, the, inspiration, of, the, holy, spirit, and, is, made, available, through, the, teaching, of, the, prophets, summed, up, in, holy, scripture, and, transmitted, by, the, magisterium, the, sum, of, which, is, called, tradition, natural, revelation, is, the, truth, available, to, all, people, through, their, human, nature, and, powers, of, reason, for, example, he, felt, this, applied, to, rational, ways, to, know, the, existence, of, god, though, one, may, deduce, the, existence, of, god, and, his, attributes, unity, truth, goodness, power, knowledge, through, reason, certain, specifics, may, be, known, only, through, the, special, revelation, of, god, through, jesus, christ, the, major, theological, components, of, christianity, such, as, the, trinity, the, incarnation, and, charity, are, revealed, in, the, teachings, of, the, church, and, the, scriptures, and, may, not, otherwise, be, deduced, however, thomas, also, makes, a, distinction, between, demonstrations, of, sacred, doctrines, and, the, persuasiveness, of, those, doctrines, the, former, is, akin, to, something, like, certainty, whereas, the, latter, is, more, probabilistic, in, nature, in, other, words, thomas, thought, christian, doctrines, were, fitting, to, reason, i, e, reasonable, even, though, they, cannot, be, demonstrated, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, in, fact, the, summa, theologica, is, filled, with, examples, of, thomas, arguing, that, we, would, expect, certain, christian, doctrines, to, be, true, even, though, these, expectations, are, not, demonstrative, i, e, fitting, or, reasonable, for, example, thomas, argues, that, we, would, expect, god, to, become, incarnate, and, we, would, expect, a, resurrected, christ, to, not, stay, on, earth, according, to, thomas, faith, and, reason, complement, rather, than, contradict, each, other, each, giving, different, views, of, the, same, truth, a, discrepancy, between, faith, and, reason, arises, from, a, shortcoming, of, either, natural, science, or, scriptural, interpretation, faith, can, reveal, a, divine, mystery, that, eludes, scientific, observation, on, the, other, hand, science, can, suggest, where, fallible, humans, misinterpret, a, scriptural, metaphor, as, a, literal, statement, of, fact, augustine, of, hippo, s, reflection, on, divine, essentiality, or, essentialist, theology, would, influence, richard, of, st, victor, alexander, of, hales, and, bonaventure, by, this, method, the, essence, of, god, is, defined, by, what, god, is, and, also, by, describing, what, god, is, not, negative, theology, thomas, took, the, text, of, exodus, beyond, the, explanation, of, essential, theology, he, bridged, the, gap, of, understanding, between, the, being, of, essence, and, the, being, of, existence, in, summa, theologica, the, way, is, prepared, with, the, proofs, for, the, existence, of, god, all, that, remained, was, to, recognize, the, god, of, exodus, as, having, the, nature, of, him, who, is, the, supreme, act, of, being, god, is, simple, there, is, no, composition, in, god, in, this, regard, thomas, relied, on, boethius, who, in, turn, followed, the, path, of, platonism, something, thomas, usually, avoided, the, conclusion, was, that, the, meaning, of, i, am, who, i, am, is, not, an, enigma, to, be, answered, but, a, statement, of, the, essence, of, god, this, is, the, discovery, of, thomas, the, essence, of, god, is, not, described, by, negative, analogy, but, the, essence, of, god, is, to, exist, this, is, the, basis, of, existential, theology, and, leads, to, what, gilson, calls, the, first, and, only, existential, philosophy, in, latin, this, is, called, haec, sublimis, veritas, the, sublime, truth, the, revealed, essence, of, god, is, to, exist, or, in, the, words, of, thomas, i, am, the, pure, act, of, being, this, has, been, described, as, the, key, to, understanding, thomism, thomism, has, been, described, as, a, philosophical, movement, as, either, the, emptiest, or, the, fullest, of, philosophies, as, a, catholic, thomas, believed, that, god, was, the, maker, of, heaven, and, earth, of, all, that, is, visible, and, invisible, but, he, thought, that, this, fact, can, be, proved, by, natural, reason, indeed, in, showing, that, it, is, necessary, that, any, existent, being, has, been, created, by, god, he, uses, only, philosophical, arguments, based, on, his, metaphysics, of, participation, he, also, maintains, that, god, creates, ex, nihilo, from, nothing, that, is, he, does, not, make, use, of, any, preexisting, matter, on, the, other, hand, thomas, thought, that, the, fact, that, the, world, started, to, exist, by, god, s, creation, and, is, not, eternal, is, only, known, to, us, by, faith, it, cannot, be, proved, by, natural, reason, like, aristotle, thomas, posited, that, life, could, form, from, non, living, material, or, plant, life, since, the, generation, of, one, thing, is, the, corruption, of, another, it, was, not, incompatible, with, the, first, formation, of, things, that, from, the, corruption, of, the, less, perfect, the, more, perfect, should, be, generated, hence, animals, generated, from, the, corruption, of, inanimate, things, or, of, plants, may, have, been, generated, then, additionally, thomas, considered, empedocles, s, theory, that, various, mutated, species, emerged, at, the, dawn, of, creation, thomas, reasoned, that, these, species, were, generated, through, mutations, in, animal, sperm, and, argued, that, they, were, not, unintended, by, nature, rather, such, species, were, simply, not, intended, for, perpetual, existence, that, discussion, is, found, in, his, commentary, on, aristotle, s, physics, the, same, thing, is, true, of, those, substances, empedocles, said, were, produced, at, the, beginning, of, the, world, such, as, the, ox, progeny, i, e, half, ox, and, half, man, for, if, such, things, were, not, able, to, arrive, at, some, end, and, final, state, of, nature, so, that, they, would, be, preserved, in, existence, this, was, not, because, nature, did, not, intend, this, but, because, they, were, not, capable, of, being, preserved, for, they, were, not, generated, according, to, nature, but, by, the, corruption, of, some, natural, principle, as, it, now, also, happens, that, some, monstrous, offspring, are, generated, because, of, the, corruption, of, seed, thomas, believed, that, the, existence, of, god, is, self, evident, in, itself, but, not, to, us, therefore, i, say, that, this, proposition, god, exists, of, itself, is, self, evident, for, the, predicate, is, the, same, as, the, subject, now, because, we, do, not, know, the, essence, of, god, the, proposition, is, not, self, evident, to, us, but, needs, to, be, demonstrated, by, things, that, are, more, known, to, us, though, less, known, in, their, nature, namely, by, effects, thomas, believed, that, the, existence, of, god, can, be, demonstrated, briefly, in, the, summa, theologiae, and, more, extensively, in, the, summa, contra, gentiles, he, considered, in, great, detail, five, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, widely, known, as, the, quinque, viae, five, ways, thomas, was, receptive, to, and, influenced, by, avicenna, s, proof, of, the, truthful, concerning, the, nature, of, god, thomas, like, avicenna, felt, the, best, approach, commonly, called, the, via, negativa, was, to, consider, what, god, is, not, this, led, him, to, propose, five, statements, about, the, divine, qualities, following, augustine, of, hippo, thomas, defines, sin, as, a, word, deed, or, desire, contrary, to, the, eternal, law, it, is, important, to, note, the, analogous, nature, of, law, in, thomas, s, legal, philosophy, natural, law, is, an, instance, or, instantiation, of, eternal, law, because, natural, law, is, what, human, beings, determine, according, to, their, own, nature, as, rational, beings, disobeying, reason, is, disobeying, natural, law, and, eternal, law, thus, eternal, law, is, logically, prior, to, reception, of, either, natural, law, that, determined, by, reason, or, divine, law, that, found, in, the, old, and, new, testaments, in, other, words, god, s, will, extends, to, both, reason, and, revelation, sin, is, abrogating, either, one, s, own, reason, on, the, one, hand, or, revelation, on, the, other, and, is, synonymous, with, evil, privation, of, good, or, privatio, boni, thomas, like, all, scholastics, generally, argued, that, the, findings, of, reason, and, data, of, revelation, cannot, conflict, so, both, are, a, guide, to, god, s, will, for, human, beings, thomas, argued, that, god, while, perfectly, united, also, is, perfectly, described, by, three, interrelated, persons, these, three, persons, father, son, and, holy, spirit, are, constituted, by, their, relations, within, the, essence, of, god, thomas, wrote, that, the, term, trinity, does, not, mean, the, relations, themselves, of, the, persons, but, rather, the, number, of, persons, related, to, each, other, and, hence, it, is, that, the, word, in, itself, does, not, express, regard, to, another, the, father, generates, the, son, or, the, word, by, the, relation, of, self, awareness, this, eternal, generation, then, produces, an, eternal, spirit, who, enjoys, the, divine, nature, as, the, love, of, god, the, love, of, the, father, for, the, word, this, trinity, exists, independently, from, the, world, it, transcends, the, created, world, but, the, trinity, also, decided, to, give, grace, to, human, beings, this, takes, place, through, the, incarnation, of, the, word, in, the, person, of, jesus, christ, and, through, the, indwelling, of, the, holy, spirit, within, those, who, have, experienced, salvation, by, god, according, to, aidan, nichols, thomas, s, five, proofs, for, the, existence, of, god, take, some, of, aristotle, s, assertions, concerning, the, principles, of, being, for, god, as, prima, causa, first, cause, comes, from, aristotle, s, concept, of, the, unmoved, mover, and, asserts, that, god, is, the, ultimate, cause, of, all, things, in, the, summa, theologica, thomas, begins, his, discussion, of, jesus, christ, by, recounting, the, biblical, story, of, adam, and, eve, and, by, describing, the, negative, effects, of, original, sin, the, purpose, of, christ, s, incarnation, was, to, restore, human, nature, by, removing, the, contamination, of, sin, which, humans, cannot, do, by, themselves, divine, wisdom, judged, it, fitting, that, god, should, become, man, so, that, thus, one, and, the, same, person, would, be, able, both, to, restore, man, and, to, offer, satisfaction, thomas, argued, in, favour, of, the, satisfaction, view, of, atonement, that, is, that, jesus, christ, died, to, satisfy, for, the, whole, human, race, which, was, sentenced, to, die, on, account, of, sin, thomas, argued, against, several, specific, contemporary, and, historical, theologians, who, held, differing, views, about, christ, in, response, to, photinus, thomas, stated, that, jesus, was, truly, divine, and, not, simply, a, human, being, against, nestorius, who, suggested, that, the, son, of, god, was, merely, conjoined, to, the, man, christ, thomas, argued, that, the, fullness, of, god, was, an, integral, part, of, christ, s, existence, however, countering, apollinaris, views, thomas, held, that, christ, had, a, truly, human, rational, soul, as, well, this, produced, a, duality, of, nature, in, christ, thomas, argued, against, eutyches, that, this, duality, persisted, after, the, incarnation, thomas, stated, that, these, two, natures, existed, simultaneously, yet, distinguishably, in, one, real, human, body, unlike, the, teachings, of, manichaeus, and, valentinus, with, respect, to, paul, s, assertion, that, christ, though, he, was, in, the, form, of, god, emptied, himself, philippians, 2, 6, 7, in, becoming, human, thomas, offered, an, articulation, of, divine, kenosis, that, has, informed, much, subsequent, catholic, christology, following, the, council, of, nicaea, augustine, of, hippo, as, well, as, the, assertions, of, scripture, thomas, held, the, doctrine, of, divine, immutability, hence, in, becoming, human, there, could, be, no, change, in, the, divine, person, of, christ, for, thomas, the, mystery, of, incarnation, was, not, completed, through, god, being, changed, in, any, way, from, the, state, in, which, he, had, been, from, eternity, but, through, his, having, united, himself, to, the, creature, in, a, new, way, or, rather, through, having, united, it, to, himself, similarly, thomas, explained, that, christ, emptied, himself, not, by, putting, off, his, divine, nature, but, by, assuming, a, human, nature, for, thomas, the, divine, nature, is, sufficiently, full, because, every, perfection, of, goodness, is, there, but, human, nature, and, the, soul, are, not, full, but, capable, of, fulness, because, it, was, made, as, a, slate, not, written, upon, therefore, human, nature, is, empty, thus, when, paul, indicates, that, christ, emptied, himself, this, is, to, be, understood, in, light, of, his, assumption, of, a, human, nature, in, short, christ, had, a, real, body, of, the, same, nature, of, ours, a, true, rational, soul, and, together, with, these, perfect, deity, thus, there, is, both, unity, in, his, one, hypostasis, and, composition, in, his, two, natures, human, and, divine, in, christ, i, answer, that, the, person, or, hypostasis, of, christ, may, be, viewed, in, two, ways, first, as, it, is, in, itself, and, thus, it, is, altogether, simple, even, as, the, nature, of, the, word, secondly, in, the, aspect, of, person, or, hypostasis, to, which, it, belongs, to, subsist, in, a, nature, and, thus, the, person, of, christ, subsists, in, two, natures, hence, though, there, is, one, subsisting, being, in, him, yet, there, are, different, aspects, of, subsistence, and, hence, he, is, said, to, be, a, composite, person, insomuch, as, one, being, subsists, in, two, echoing, athanasius, of, alexandria, he, said, that, the, only, begotten, son, of, god, assumed, our, nature, so, that, he, made, man, might, make, men, gods, thomas, aquinas, identified, the, goal, of, human, existence, as, union, and, eternal, fellowship, with, god, this, goal, is, achieved, through, the, beatific, vision, in, which, a, person, experiences, perfect, unending, happiness, by, seeing, the, essence, of, god, the, vision, occurs, after, death, as, a, gift, from, god, to, those, who, in, life, experienced, salvation, and, redemption, through, christ, the, goal, of, union, with, god, has, implications, for, the, individual, s, life, on, earth, thomas, stated, that, an, individual, s, will, must, be, ordered, toward, the, right, things, such, as, charity, peace, and, holiness, he, saw, this, orientation, as, also, the, way, to, happiness, indeed, thomas, ordered, his, treatment, of, the, moral, life, around, the, idea, of, happiness, the, relationship, between, will, and, goal, is, antecedent, in, nature, because, rectitude, of, the, will, consists, in, being, duly, ordered, to, the, last, end, those, who, truly, seek, to, understand, and, see, god, will, necessarily, love, what, god, loves, such, love, requires, morality, and, bears, fruit, in, everyday, human, choices, thomas, aquinas, belonged, to, the, dominican, order, formally, ordo, praedicatorum, the, order, of, preachers, which, began, as, an, order, dedicated, to, the, conversion, of, the, albigensians, and, other, heterodox, factions, at, first, by, peaceful, means, later, the, albigensians, were, dealt, with, by, means, of, the, albigensian, crusade, in, the, summa, theologiae, he, wrote, with, regard, to, heretics, two, points, must, be, observed, one, on, their, own, side, the, other, on, the, side, of, the, church, on, their, own, side, there, is, the, sin, whereby, they, deserve, not, only, to, be, separated, from, the, church, by, excommunication, but, also, to, be, severed, from, the, world, by, death, for, it, is, a, much, graver, matter, to, corrupt, the, faith, that, quickens, the, soul, than, to, forge, money, which, supports, temporal, life, wherefore, if, forgers, of, money, and, other, evil, doers, are, forthwith, condemned, to, death, by, the, secular, authority, much, more, reason, is, there, for, heretics, as, soon, as, they, are, convicted, of, heresy, to, be, not, only, excommunicated, but, even, put, to, death, on, the, part, of, the, church, however, there, is, mercy, which, looks, to, the, conversion, of, the, wanderer, wherefore, she, condemns, not, at, once, but, after, the, first, and, second, admonition, as, the, apostle, directs, after, that, if, he, is, yet, stubborn, the, church, no, longer, hoping, for, his, conversion, looks, to, the, salvation, of, others, by, excommunicating, him, and, separating, him, from, the, church, and, furthermore, delivers, him, to, the, secular, tribunal, to, be, exterminated, thereby, from, the, world, by, death, heresy, was, a, capital, offence, against, the, secular, law, of, most, european, countries, of, the, 13th, century, kings, and, emperors, even, those, at, war, with, the, papacy, listed, heresy, first, among, the, crimes, against, the, state, kings, claimed, power, from, god, according, to, the, christian, faith, often, enough, especially, in, that, age, of, papal, claims, to, universal, worldly, power, the, rulers, power, was, tangibly, and, visibly, legitimated, directly, through, coronation, by, the, pope, simple, theft, forgery, fraud, and, other, such, crimes, were, also, capital, offences, thomas, s, point, seems, to, be, that, the, gravity, of, this, offence, which, touches, not, only, the, material, goods, but, also, the, spiritual, goods, of, others, is, at, least, the, same, as, forgery, thomas, s, suggestion, specifically, demands, that, heretics, be, handed, to, a, secular, tribunal, rather, than, magisterial, authority, that, thomas, specifically, says, that, heretics, deserve, death, is, related, to, his, theology, according, to, which, all, sinners, have, no, intrinsic, right, to, life, for, the, wages, of, sin, is, death, but, the, free, gift, of, god, is, eternal, life, in, christ, jesus, our, lord, although, the, life, of, a, heretic, who, repents, should, be, spared, the, former, heretic, should, be, executed, if, he, relapses, into, heresy, thomas, elaborates, on, his, opinion, regarding, heresy, in, the, next, article, when, he, says, in, god, s, tribunal, those, who, return, are, always, received, because, god, is, a, searcher, of, hearts, and, knows, those, who, return, in, sincerity, but, the, church, cannot, imitate, god, in, this, for, she, presumes, that, those, who, relapse, after, being, once, received, are, not, sincere, in, their, return, hence, she, does, not, debar, them, from, the, way, of, salvation, but, neither, does, she, protect, them, from, the, sentence, of, death, for, this, reason, the, church, not, only, admits, to, penance, those, who, return, from, heresy, for, the, first, time, but, also, safeguards, their, lives, and, sometimes, by, dispensation, restores, them, to, the, ecclesiastical, dignities, which, they, may, have, had, before, should, their, conversion, appear, to, be, sincere, we, read, of, this, as, having, frequently, been, done, for, the, good, of, peace, but, when, they, fall, again, after, having, been, received, this, seems, to, prove, them, to, be, inconstant, in, faith, wherefore, when, they, return, again, they, are, admitted, to, penance, but, are, not, delivered, from, the, pain, of, death, for, jews, thomas, argues, for, toleration, of, both, their, persons, and, their, religious, rites, the, position, taken, by, thomas, was, that, if, children, were, being, reared, in, error, the, church, had, no, authority, to, intervene, from, summa, theologica, ii, ii, q, 10, art, 12, the, question, was, again, addressed, by, thomas, in, summa, theologica, iii, q, 68, art, 10, the, issue, was, discussed, in, a, papal, bull, by, pope, benedict, xiv, 1747, where, both, schools, were, addressed, the, pope, noted, that, the, position, of, aquinas, had, been, more, widely, held, among, theologians, and, canon, lawyers, than, that, of, john, duns, scotus, regarding, magic, thomas, wrote, that, a, mention, of, witchcraft, appears, in, the, summa, theologicae, and, concludes, that, the, church, does, not, treat, temporary, or, permanent, impotence, attributed, to, a, spell, any, differently, to, that, of, natural, causes, as, far, as, an, impediment, to, marriage, under, the, canon, episcopi, church, doctrine, held, that, witchcraft, was, not, possible, and, any, practitioners, of, sorcery, were, deluded, and, their, acts, an, illusion, thomas, aquinas, was, cited, in, a, new, doctrine, that, included, the, belief, in, witches, this, was, a, departure, from, the, teachings, of, his, master, albertus, magnus, whose, doctrine, was, based, in, the, episcopi, to, what, extent, dominican, inquisitors, such, as, heinrich, kramer, really, found, support, in, thomas, is, irrelevant, in, this, context, thus, associating, thomas, s, name, with, the, whole, aspect, of, witchcraft, and, the, persecution, of, witches, the, famous, 15th, century, witch, hunter, s, manual, the, malleus, maleficarum, also, written, by, a, member, of, the, dominican, order, begins, by, quoting, thomas, aquinas, commentary, on, pronouncements, sent, 4, 34, i, co, refuting, the, episcopi, and, goes, on, to, cite, thomas, aquinas, over, a, hundred, times, promoters, of, the, witch, hunts, that, followed, often, quoted, thomas, more, than, any, other, source, thomas, aquinas, s, statements, remain, essentially, theoretical, and, lack, any, direct, relation, to, the, subsequent, persecution, of, witches, a, grasp, of, thomas, s, psychology, is, essential, for, understanding, his, beliefs, about, the, afterlife, and, resurrection, thomas, following, church, doctrine, accepts, that, the, soul, continues, to, exist, after, the, death, of, the, body, because, he, accepts, that, the, soul, is, the, form, of, the, body, then, he, also, must, believe, that, the, human, being, like, all, material, things, is, form, matter, composite, the, substantial, form, the, human, soul, configures, prime, matter, the, physical, body, and, is, the, form, by, which, a, material, composite, belongs, to, that, species, it, does, in, the, case, of, human, beings, that, species, is, a, rational, animal, so, a, human, being, is, a, matter, form, composite, that, is, organized, to, be, a, rational, animal, matter, cannot, exist, without, being, configured, by, form, but, form, can, exist, without, matter, which, allows, for, the, separation, of, soul, from, body, thomas, says, that, the, soul, shares, in, the, material, and, spiritual, worlds, and, so, has, some, features, of, matter, and, other, immaterial, features, such, as, access, to, universals, the, human, soul, is, different, from, other, material, and, spiritual, things, it, is, created, by, god, but, also, comes, into, existence, only, in, the, material, body, human, beings, are, material, but, the, human, person, can, survive, the, death, of, the, body, through, the, continued, existence, of, the, soul, which, persists, the, human, soul, straddles, the, spiritual, and, material, worlds, and, is, both, a, configured, subsistent, form, as, well, as, a, configurer, of, matter, into, that, of, a, living, bodily, human, because, it, is, spiritual, the, human, soul, does, not, depend, on, matter, and, may, exist, separately, because, the, human, being, is, a, soul, matter, composite, the, body, has, a, part, in, what, it, is, to, be, human, perfected, human, nature, consists, in, the, human, dual, nature, embodied, and, intellecting, resurrection, appears, to, require, dualism, which, thomas, rejects, yet, thomas, believes, the, soul, persists, after, the, death, and, corruption, of, the, body, and, is, capable, of, existence, separated, from, the, body, between, the, time, of, death, and, the, resurrection, of, the, flesh, thomas, believes, in, a, different, sort, of, dualism, one, guided, by, christian, scripture, thomas, knows, that, human, beings, are, essentially, physical, but, physicality, has, a, spirit, capable, of, returning, to, god, after, life, for, thomas, the, rewards, and, punishment, of, the, afterlife, are, not, only, spiritual, because, of, this, resurrection, is, an, important, part, of, his, philosophy, on, the, soul, the, human, is, fulfilled, and, complete, in, the, body, so, the, hereafter, must, take, place, with, souls, enmattered, in, resurrected, bodies, in, addition, to, spiritual, reward, humans, can, expect, to, enjoy, material, and, physical, blessings, because, thomas, s, soul, requires, a, body, for, its, actions, during, the, afterlife, the, soul, will, also, be, punished, or, rewarded, in, corporeal, existence, thomas, states, clearly, his, stance, on, resurrection, and, uses, it, to, back, up, his, philosophy, of, justice, that, is, the, promise, of, resurrection, compensates, christians, who, suffered, in, this, world, through, a, heavenly, union, with, the, divine, he, says, if, there, is, no, resurrection, of, the, dead, it, follows, that, there, is, no, good, for, human, beings, other, than, in, this, life, resurrection, provides, the, impetus, for, people, on, earth, to, give, up, pleasures, in, this, life, thomas, believes, the, human, who, prepared, for, the, afterlife, both, morally, and, intellectually, will, be, rewarded, more, greatly, however, all, reward, is, through, the, grace, of, god, thomas, insists, beatitude, will, be, conferred, according, to, merit, and, will, render, the, person, better, able, to, conceive, the, divine, thomas, accordingly, believes, punishment, is, directly, related, to, earthly, living, preparation, and, activity, as, well, thomas, s, account, of, the, soul, focuses, on, epistemology, and, metaphysics, and, because, of, this, he, believes, it, gives, a, clear, account, of, the, immaterial, nature, of, the, soul, thomas, conservatively, guards, christian, doctrine, and, thus, maintains, physical, and, spiritual, reward, and, punishment, after, death, by, accepting, the, essentiality, of, both, body, and, soul, he, allows, for, a, heaven, and, hell, described, in, scripture, and, church, dogma, thomas, aquinas, was, a, theologian, and, a, scholastic, philosopher, he, never, considered, himself, a, philosopher, and, criticized, philosophers, whom, he, saw, as, pagans, for, always, falling, short, of, the, true, and, proper, wisdom, to, be, found, in, christian, revelation, with, this, in, mind, thomas, did, have, respect, for, aristotle, so, much, so, that, in, the, summa, he, often, cites, aristotle, simply, as, the, philosopher, a, designation, frequently, used, at, that, time, however, thomas, never, compromised, christian, doctrine, by, bringing, it, into, line, with, current, aristotelianism, rather, he, modified, and, corrected, the, latter, whenever, it, clashed, with, christian, belief, much, of, thomas, s, work, bears, upon, philosophical, topics, and, in, this, sense, may, be, characterized, as, philosophical, his, philosophical, thought, has, exerted, enormous, influence, on, subsequent, christian, theology, especially, that, of, the, catholic, church, extending, to, western, philosophy, in, general, thomas, aquinas, wrote, several, important, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, works, including, on, the, soul, on, interpretation, posterior, analytics, nicomachean, ethics, physics, and, metaphysics, his, work, is, associated, with, william, of, moerbeke, s, translations, of, aristotle, from, greek, into, latin, thomas, aquinas, believed, that, for, the, knowledge, of, any, truth, whatsoever, man, needs, divine, help, that, the, intellect, may, be, moved, by, god, to, its, act, however, he, believed, that, human, beings, have, the, natural, capacity, to, know, many, things, without, special, divine, revelation, even, though, such, revelation, occurs, from, time, to, time, especially, in, regard, to, such, truths, as, pertain, to, faith, but, this, is, the, light, that, is, given, to, man, by, god, according, to, man, s, nature, now, every, form, bestowed, on, created, things, by, god, has, power, for, a, determined, act, which, it, can, bring, about, in, proportion, to, its, own, proper, endowment, and, beyond, which, it, is, powerless, except, by, a, superadded, form, as, water, can, only, heat, when, heated, by, the, fire, and, thus, the, human, understanding, has, a, form, viz, intelligible, light, which, of, itself, is, sufficient, for, knowing, certain, intelligible, things, viz, those, we, can, come, to, know, through, the, senses, thomas, was, aware, that, the, albigensians, and, the, waldensians, challenged, moral, precepts, concerning, marriage, and, ownership, of, private, property, and, that, challenges, could, ultimately, be, resolved, only, by, logical, arguments, based, on, self, evident, norms, he, accordingly, argued, in, the, summa, theologiae, that, just, as, the, first, principle, of, demonstration, is, the, self, evident, principle, of, noncontradiction, the, same, thing, cannot, be, affirmed, and, denied, at, the, same, time, the, first, principle, of, action, is, the, self, evident, bonum, precept, good, is, to, be, done, and, pursued, and, evil, avoided, this, natural, law, precept, prescribes, doing, and, pursuing, what, reason, knows, is, good, while, avoiding, evil, reason, knows, what, is, objectively, good, because, good, is, naturally, beneficial, and, evil, is, the, contrary, to, explain, goods, that, are, naturally, self, evident, thomas, divides, them, into, three, categories, substantial, goods, of, self, preservation, desired, by, all, the, goods, common, to, both, animals, and, humans, such, as, procreation, and, education, of, offspring, and, goods, characteristic, of, rational, and, intellectual, beings, such, as, living, in, community, and, pursuing, the, truth, about, god, to, will, such, natural, goods, to, oneself, and, to, others, is, to, love, accordingly, thomas, states, that, the, love, precept, obligating, loving, god, and, neighbour, are, the, first, general, principles, of, the, natural, law, and, are, self, evident, to, human, reason, either, through, nature, or, through, faith, wherefore, all, the, precepts, of, the, decalogue, are, referred, to, these, as, conclusions, to, general, principles, to, so, focus, on, lovingly, willing, good, is, to, focus, natural, law, on, acting, virtuously, in, his, summa, theologiae, thomas, wrote, virtue, denotes, a, certain, perfection, of, a, power, now, a, thing, s, perfection, is, considered, chiefly, in, regard, to, its, end, but, the, end, of, power, is, act, wherefore, power, is, said, to, be, perfect, according, as, it, is, determinate, to, its, act, thomas, emphasized, that, synderesis, is, said, to, be, the, law, of, our, mind, because, it, is, a, habit, containing, the, precepts, of, the, natural, law, which, are, the, first, principles, of, human, actions, according, to, thomas, all, acts, of, virtue, are, prescribed, by, the, natural, law, since, each, one, s, reason, naturally, dictates, to, him, to, act, virtuously, but, if, we, speak, of, virtuous, acts, considered, in, themselves, i, e, in, their, proper, species, thus, not, all, virtuous, acts, are, prescribed, by, the, natural, law, for, many, things, are, done, virtuously, to, which, nature, does, not, incline, at, first, but, that, through, the, inquiry, of, reason, have, been, found, by, men, to, be, conducive, to, well, living, therefore, we, must, determine, if, we, are, speaking, of, virtuous, acts, as, under, the, aspect, of, virtuous, or, as, an, act, in, its, species, thomas, defined, the, four, cardinal, virtues, as, prudence, temperance, justice, and, fortitude, the, cardinal, virtues, are, natural, and, revealed, in, nature, and, they, are, binding, on, everyone, there, are, however, three, theological, virtues, faith, hope, and, charity, thomas, also, describes, the, virtues, as, imperfect, incomplete, and, perfect, complete, virtues, a, perfect, virtue, is, any, virtue, with, charity, charity, completes, a, cardinal, virtue, a, non, christian, can, display, courage, but, it, would, be, courage, with, temperance, a, christian, would, display, courage, with, charity, these, are, somewhat, supernatural, and, are, distinct, from, other, virtues, in, their, object, namely, god, now, the, object, of, the, theological, virtues, is, god, himself, who, is, the, last, end, of, all, as, surpassing, the, knowledge, of, our, reason, on, the, other, hand, the, object, of, the, intellectual, and, moral, virtues, is, something, comprehensible, to, human, reason, therefore, the, theological, virtues, are, specifically, distinct, from, the, moral, and, intellectual, virtues, thomas, aquinas, wrote, is, a, sin, against, god, just, as, all, mortal, sins, in, as, much, as, man, condemns, things, eternal, for, the, sake, of, temporal, things, furthermore, in, his, treatise, on, law, thomas, distinguished, four, kinds, of, law, eternal, natural, human, and, divine, eternal, law, is, the, decree, of, god, that, governs, all, creation, that, law, which, is, the, supreme, reason, cannot, be, understood, to, be, otherwise, than, unchangeable, and, eternal, natural, law, is, the, human, participation, in, the, eternal, law, and, is, discovered, by, reason, natural, law, is, based, on, first, principles, this, is, the, first, precept, of, the, law, that, good, is, to, be, done, and, promoted, and, evil, is, to, be, avoided, all, other, precepts, of, the, natural, law, are, based, on, this, whether, the, natural, law, contains, several, precepts, or, one, only, is, explained, by, thomas, all, the, inclinations, of, any, parts, whatsoever, of, human, nature, e, g, of, the, concupiscible, and, irascible, parts, in, so, far, as, they, are, ruled, by, reason, belong, to, the, natural, law, and, are, reduced, to, one, first, precept, as, stated, above, so, that, the, precepts, of, the, natural, law, are, many, in, themselves, but, are, based, on, one, common, foundation, the, desires, to, live, and, to, procreate, are, counted, by, thomas, among, those, basic, natural, human, values, on, which, all, human, values, are, based, according, to, thomas, all, human, tendencies, are, geared, towards, real, human, goods, in, this, case, the, human, nature, in, question, is, marriage, the, total, gift, of, oneself, to, another, that, ensures, a, family, for, children, and, a, future, for, mankind, he, defined, the, dual, inclination, of, the, action, of, love, towards, the, good, which, a, man, wishes, to, someone, to, himself, or, to, another, and, towards, that, to, which, he, wishes, some, good, concerning, human, law, thomas, concludes, that, just, as, in, the, speculative, reason, from, naturally, known, indemonstrable, principles, we, draw, the, conclusions, of, the, various, sciences, the, knowledge, of, which, is, not, imparted, to, us, by, nature, but, acquired, by, the, efforts, of, reason, so, to, it, is, from, the, precepts, of, the, natural, law, as, from, general, and, indemonstrable, principles, that, human, reason, needs, to, proceed, to, the, more, particular, determination, of, certain, matters, these, particular, determinations, devised, by, human, reason, are, called, human, laws, provided, the, other, essential, conditions, of, law, be, observed, human, law, is, positive, law, the, natural, law, applied, by, governments, to, societies, natural, and, human, law, is, not, adequate, alone, the, need, for, human, behaviour, to, be, directed, made, it, necessary, to, have, divine, law, divine, law, is, the, specially, revealed, law, in, the, scriptures, thomas, quotes, the, apostle, says, hebrews, 7, 12, the, priesthood, being, translated, it, is, necessary, that, a, translation, also, be, made, of, the, law, but, the, priesthood, is, twofold, as, stated, in, the, same, passage, viz, the, levitical, priesthood, and, the, priesthood, of, christ, therefore, the, divine, law, is, twofold, namely, the, old, law, and, the, new, law, thomas, also, greatly, influenced, catholic, understandings, of, mortal, and, venial, sins, thomas, aquinas, refers, to, animals, as, dumb, and, that, the, natural, order, has, declared, animals, for, man, s, use, thomas, denied, that, human, beings, have, any, duty, of, charity, to, animals, because, they, are, not, persons, otherwise, it, would, be, unlawful, to, kill, them, for, food, but, humans, should, still, be, charitable, to, them, for, cruel, habits, might, carry, over, into, our, treatment, of, human, beings, thomas, contributed, to, economic, thought, as, an, aspect, of, ethics, and, justice, he, dealt, with, the, concept, of, a, just, price, normally, its, market, price, or, a, regulated, price, sufficient, to, cover, seller, costs, of, production, he, argued, it, was, immoral, for, sellers, to, raise, their, prices, simply, because, buyers, were, in, pressing, need, of, a, product, thomas, s, theory, of, political, order, became, highly, influential, he, sees, man, as, a, social, being, who, lives, in, a, community, and, interacts, with, its, other, members, that, leads, among, other, things, to, the, division, of, labour, thomas, made, a, distinction, between, a, good, man, and, a, good, citizen, which, was, important, to, the, development, of, libertarian, theory, that, indicates, in, the, eyes, of, the, atheist, libertarian, writer, george, h, smith, that, the, sphere, of, individual, autonomy, was, one, which, the, state, could, not, interfere, with, thomas, thought, that, monarchy, was, the, best, form, of, government, because, a, monarch, does, not, have, to, form, compromises, with, other, persons, thomas, however, held, that, monarchy, in, only, a, very, specific, sense, was, the, best, form, of, government, only, when, the, king, was, virtuous, is, it, the, best, form, otherwise, if, the, monarch, is, vicious, it, is, the, worst, kind, see, de, regno, i, ch, 2, moreover, according, to, thomas, oligarchy, degenerates, more, easily, into, tyranny, than, monarchy, to, prevent, a, king, from, becoming, a, tyrant, his, political, powers, must, be, curbed, unless, an, agreement, of, all, persons, involved, can, be, reached, a, tyrant, must, be, tolerated, as, otherwise, the, political, situation, could, deteriorate, into, anarchy, which, would, be, even, worse, than, tyranny, in, his, political, work, de, regno, thomas, subordinated, the, political, power, of, the, king, to, the, primacy, of, the, divine, and, human, law, of, god, the, creator, for, example, he, affirmed, just, as, the, government, of, a, king, is, the, best, so, the, government, of, a, tyrant, is, the, worst, it, is, plain, therefore, from, what, has, been, said, that, a, king, is, one, who, rules, the, people, of, one, city, or, province, and, rules, them, for, the, common, good, according, to, thomas, monarchs, are, god, s, representatives, in, their, territories, but, the, church, represented, by, the, popes, is, above, the, kings, in, matters, of, doctrine, and, ethics, as, a, consequence, worldly, rulers, are, obliged, to, adapt, their, laws, to, the, catholic, church, s, doctrines, and, determinations, thomas, said, slavery, was, not, the, natural, state, of, man, he, also, held, that, a, slave, is, by, nature, equal, to, his, master, summa, theologiae, supplement, q52, a2, ad, 1, he, distinguished, between, natural, slavery, which, is, for, the, benefit, of, both, master, and, slave, and, servile, slavery, which, removes, all, autonomy, from, the, slave, and, is, according, to, thomas, worse, than, death, aquinas, doctrines, of, the, fair, price, of, the, right, of, tyrannicide, and, of, the, equality, of, all, the, baptized, sons, of, god, in, the, communion, of, saints, established, a, limit, to, the, political, power, to, prevent, it, from, degenerating, into, tyranny, this, system, had, a, concern, in, the, protestant, opposition, to, the, catholic, church, and, in, disinterested, replies, to, thomism, carried, out, by, kant, and, by, spinoza, in, summa, contra, gentiles, book, 3, chapter, 146, which, was, written, by, thomas, prior, to, writing, the, summa, theologica, thomas, allowed, the, judicial, death, penalty, he, stated, en, who, are, in, authority, over, others, do, no, wrong, when, they, reward, the, good, and, punish, the, evil, for, the, preservation, of, concord, among, men, it, is, necessary, that, punishments, be, inflicted, on, the, wicked, therefore, to, punish, the, wicked, is, not, in, itself, evil, moreover, the, common, good, is, better, than, the, particular, good, of, one, person, so, the, particular, good, should, be, removed, in, order, to, preserve, the, common, good, but, the, life, of, certain, pestiferous, men, is, an, impediment, to, the, common, good, which, is, the, concord, of, human, society, therefore, certain, men, must, be, removed, by, death, from, the, society, of, men, furthermore, just, as, a, physician, looks, to, health, as, the, end, in, his, work, and, health, consists, in, the, orderly, concord, of, humors, so, too, the, ruler, of, a, state, intends, peace, in, his, work, and, peace, consists, in, the, ordered, concord, of, citizens, now, the, physician, quite, properly, and, beneficially, cuts, off, a, diseased, organ, if, the, corruption, of, the, body, is, threatened, because, of, it, therefore, the, ruler, of, a, state, executes, pestiferous, men, justly, and, sinlessly, in, order, that, the, peace, of, the, state, may, not, be, disrupted, however, in, the, same, discussion, the, unjust, execution, of, men, is, prohibited, killing, which, results, from, anger, is, prohibited, the, execution, of, the, wicked, is, forbidden, wherever, cannot, be, done, without, danger, to, the, good, while, it, would, be, contradictory, to, speak, of, a, just, schism, a, just, brawling, or, a, just, sedition, the, word, war, permits, sub, classification, into, good, and, bad, kinds, thomas, aquinas, centuries, after, augustine, of, hippo, used, the, authority, of, augustine, s, arguments, in, an, attempt, to, define, the, conditions, under, which, a, war, could, be, just, he, laid, these, out, in, his, work, summa, theologica, thomas, aquinas, maintains, that, a, human, is, a, single, material, substance, he, understands, the, soul, as, the, form, of, the, body, which, makes, a, human, being, the, composite, of, the, two, thus, only, living, form, matter, composites, can, truly, be, called, human, dead, bodies, are, human, only, analogously, one, actually, existing, substance, comes, from, body, and, soul, a, human, is, a, single, material, substance, but, still, should, be, understood, as, having, an, immaterial, soul, which, continues, after, bodily, death, in, his, summa, theologiae, thomas, states, his, position, on, the, nature, of, the, soul, defining, it, as, the, first, principle, of, life, the, soul, is, not, corporeal, or, a, body, it, is, the, act, of, a, body, because, the, intellect, is, incorporeal, it, does, not, use, the, bodily, organs, as, the, operation, of, anything, follows, the, mode, of, its, being, according, to, thomas, the, soul, is, not, matter, not, even, incorporeal, or, spiritual, matter, if, it, were, it, would, not, be, able, to, understand, universals, which, are, immaterial, a, receiver, receives, things, according, to, the, receiver, s, own, nature, so, for, the, soul, receiver, to, understand, receive, universals, it, must, have, the, same, nature, as, universals, yet, any, substance, that, understands, universals, may, not, be, a, matter, form, composite, so, humans, have, rational, souls, which, are, abstract, forms, independent, of, the, body, but, a, human, being, is, one, existing, single, material, substance, that, comes, from, body, and, soul, that, is, what, thomas, means, when, he, writes, that, something, one, in, nature, can, be, formed, from, an, intellectual, substance, and, a, body, and, a, thing, one, in, nature, does, not, result, from, two, permanent, entities, unless, one, has, the, character, of, substantial, form, and, the, other, of, matter, thomas, aquinas, addressed, most, economic, questions, within, the, framework, of, justice, which, he, contended, was, the, highest, of, the, moral, virtues, he, says, that, justice, is, a, habit, whereby, man, renders, to, each, his, due, by, a, constant, and, perpetual, will, he, argued, that, this, concept, of, justice, has, its, roots, in, natural, law, joseph, schumpeter, in, his, history, of, economic, analysis, concluded, that, all, the, economic, questions, put, together, matters, less, to, him, than, did, the, smallest, point, of, theological, or, philosophical, doctrine, and, it, is, only, where, economic, phenomena, raise, questions, of, moral, theology, that, he, touches, upon, them, at, all, modern, western, views, concerning, capitalism, unfair, labor, practice, living, wage, price, gouging, monopolies, fair, trade, practices, and, predatory, pricing, inter, alia, are, remnants, of, the, inculcation, of, aquinas, interpretation, of, natural, moral, law, thomas, aquinas, distinguished, the, just, or, natural, price, of, a, good, from, that, price, which, manipulates, another, party, he, determines, the, just, price, from, a, number, of, things, first, the, just, price, must, be, relative, to, the, worth, of, the, good, thomas, held, that, the, price, of, a, good, measures, its, quality, the, quality, of, a, thing, that, comes, into, human, use, is, measured, by, the, price, given, for, it, the, price, of, a, good, measured, by, its, worth, is, determined, by, its, usefulness, to, man, this, worth, is, subjective, because, each, good, has, a, different, level, of, usefulness, to, every, man, the, price, should, reflect, the, current, value, of, a, good, according, to, its, usefulness, to, man, gold, and, silver, are, costly, not, only, on, account, of, the, usefulness, of, the, vessels, and, other, like, things, made, from, them, but, also, on, account, of, the, excellence, and, purity, of, their, substance, thomas, defines, distributive, justice, as, follows, n, distributive, justice, something, is, given, to, a, private, individual, in, so, far, as, what, belongs, to, the, whole, is, due, to, the, part, and, in, a, quantity, that, is, proportionate, to, the, importance, of, the, position, of, that, part, in, respect, of, the, whole, consequently, in, distributive, justice, a, person, receives, all, the, more, of, the, common, goods, according, as, he, holds, a, more, prominent, position, in, the, community, this, prominence, in, an, aristocratic, community, is, gauged, according, to, virtue, in, an, oligarchy, according, to, wealth, in, a, democracy, according, to, liberty, and, in, various, ways, according, to, various, forms, of, community, hence, in, distributive, justice, the, mean, is, observed, not, according, to, equality, between, thing, and, thing, but, according, to, proportion, between, things, and, persons, in, such, a, way, that, even, as, one, person, surpasses, another, so, that, which, is, given, to, one, person, surpasses, that, which, is, allotted, to, another, thomas, asserts, that, christians, have, a, duty, to, distribute, with, provision, to, the, poorest, of, society, social, justice, is, a, term, that, arose, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, writings, of, luigi, taparelli, and, it, was, his, term, for, the, reality, thomas, aquinas, called, legal, justice, or, general, justice, legal, or, social, justice, is, the, contribution, of, the, individual, to, the, common, good, so, for, thomas, distributive, justice, goes, in, the, direction, from, the, common, good, to, the, individual, and, is, a, proportional, distribution, of, common, goods, to, individuals, based, on, their, contribution, to, the, community, legal, or, general, justice, or, what, came, to, be, called, social, justice, goes, in, the, other, direction, from, the, individuals, to, the, common, good, it, is, helpful, to, understand, as, well, other, related, types, of, justice, if, social, justice, is, from, the, individual, to, the, community, and, distributive, justice, is, from, the, community, to, the, individual, there, is, also, commutative, justice, between, two, individuals, as, in, buying, and, selling, or, stealing, and, returning, as, well, as, retributive, justice, rectifications, that, occur, to, restore, justice, once, justice, has, been, violated, the, second, lateran, council, called, the, practice, of, loaning, money, detestable, and, shameful, insatiable, rapacity, of, money, lenders, forbidden, both, by, divine, and, human, laws, throughout, the, old, and, new, testament, we, condemn, and, separate, from, the, ecclesiastical, consolation, the, fifth, lateran, council, defined, usury, as, when, from, its, use, a, thing, which, produces, nothing, is, applied, to, the, acquiring, of, gain, and, profit, without, any, work, any, expense, or, any, risk, thomas, aquinas, also, wrote, extensively, on, usury, that, is, the, lending, of, money, with, interest, he, condemned, its, practice, to, take, usury, for, money, lent, is, unjust, in, itself, because, this, is, to, sell, what, does, not, exist, and, this, evidently, leads, to, inequality, which, is, contrary, to, justice, money, and, other, similar, goods, are, consumed, only, when, they, are, used, charging, a, premium, for, money, lent, is, a, charge, for, more, than, the, use, of, the, good, thus, thomas, aquinas, concluded, that, the, lender, is, charging, for, something, not, his, own, in, other, words, not, rendering, to, each, his, due, although, he, died, before, his, fiftieth, birthday, and, was, only, writing, actively, for, about, two, decades, thomas, managed, to, write, over, eight, million, words, thomas, s, systematic, works, particularly, the, summa, theologiae, are, his, best, known, but, collections, of, his, complete, works, are, dozens, of, volumes, long, his, works, can, be, grouped, into, six, categories, the, first, edition, of, thomas, s, complete, works, the, so, called, editio, piana, from, pius, v, the, pope, who, commissioned, it, was, produced, in, 1570, at, the, studium, of, the, roman, convent, at, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, the, forerunner, of, the, pontifical, university, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, angelicum, the, critical, edition, of, thomas, s, works, is, the, ongoing, edition, commissioned, by, pope, leo, xiii, 1882, 1903, under, the, title, sancti, thomae, aquinatis, doctoris, angelica, opera, omnia, the, so, called, leonine, edition, most, of, his, major, works, have, now, been, edited, for, the, leonine, edition, they, include, thomas, s, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, on, interpretation, peri, hermeneias, and, posterior, analytics, posteriorum, analyticorum, prepared, by, thomas, maria, zigliara, in, the, first, volume, 1882, the, summa, theologiae, in, nine, volumes, from, 1888, to, 1906, and, the, summa, contra, gentiles, in, three, volumes, from, 1918, to, 1930, abb, migne, published, an, edition, of, the, summa, theologiae, in, four, volumes, as, an, appendix, to, his, patrologiae, cursus, completus, english, editions, joseph, rickaby, 1872, j, m, ashley, 1888, electronic, texts, of, mostly, the, leonine, edition, are, maintained, online,
