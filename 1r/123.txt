jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, r, r, ang, gr, french, 29, august, 1780, 14, january, 1867, was, a, french, neoclassical, painter, ingres, was, profoundly, influenced, by, past, artistic, traditions, and, aspired, to, become, the, guardian, of, academic, orthodoxy, against, the, ascendant, romantic, style, although, he, considered, himself, a, painter, of, history, in, the, tradition, of, nicolas, poussin, and, jacques, louis, david, it, is, his, portraits, both, painted, and, drawn, that, are, recognized, as, his, greatest, legacy, his, expressive, distortions, of, form, and, space, made, him, an, important, precursor, of, modern, art, influencing, picasso, matisse, and, other, modernists, born, into, a, modest, family, in, montauban, he, travelled, to, paris, to, study, in, the, studio, of, david, in, 1802, he, made, his, salon, debut, and, won, the, prix, de, rome, for, his, painting, the, ambassadors, of, agamemnon, in, the, tent, of, achilles, by, the, time, he, departed, in, 1806, for, his, residency, in, rome, his, style, revealing, his, close, study, of, italian, and, flemish, renaissance, masters, was, fully, developed, and, would, change, little, for, the, rest, of, his, life, while, working, in, rome, and, subsequently, florence, from, 1806, to, 1824, he, regularly, sent, paintings, to, the, paris, salon, where, they, were, faulted, by, critics, who, found, his, style, bizarre, and, archaic, he, received, few, commissions, during, this, period, for, the, history, paintings, he, aspired, to, paint, but, was, able, to, support, himself, and, his, wife, as, a, portrait, painter, and, draughtsman, he, was, finally, recognized, at, the, salon, in, 1824, when, his, raphaelesque, painting, the, vow, of, louis, xiii, was, met, with, acclaim, and, ingres, was, acknowledged, as, the, leader, of, the, neoclassical, school, in, france, although, the, income, from, commissions, for, history, paintings, allowed, him, to, paint, fewer, portraits, his, portrait, of, monsieur, bertin, marked, his, next, popular, success, in, 1833, the, following, year, his, indignation, at, the, harsh, criticism, of, his, ambitious, composition, the, martyrdom, of, saint, symphorian, caused, him, to, return, to, italy, where, he, assumed, directorship, of, the, french, academy, in, rome, in, 1835, he, returned, to, paris, for, good, in, 1841, in, his, later, years, he, painted, new, versions, of, many, of, his, earlier, compositions, a, series, of, designs, for, stained, glass, windows, several, important, portraits, of, women, and, the, turkish, bath, the, last, of, his, several, orientalist, paintings, of, the, female, nude, which, he, finished, at, the, age, of, 83, ingres, was, born, in, montauban, tarn, et, garonne, france, the, first, of, seven, children, five, of, whom, survived, infancy, of, jean, marie, joseph, ingres, 1755, 1814, and, his, wife, anne, moulet, 1758, 1817, his, father, was, a, successful, jack, of, all, trades, in, the, arts, a, painter, of, miniatures, sculptor, decorative, stonemason, and, amateur, musician, his, mother, was, the, nearly, illiterate, daughter, of, a, master, wigmaker, from, his, father, the, young, ingres, received, early, encouragement, and, instruction, in, drawing, and, music, and, his, first, known, drawing, a, study, after, an, antique, cast, was, made, in, 1789, starting, in, 1786, he, attended, the, local, school, cole, des, fr, res, de, l, ducation, chr, tienne, but, his, education, was, disrupted, by, the, turmoil, of, the, french, revolution, and, the, closing, of, the, school, in, 1791, marked, the, end, of, his, conventional, education, the, deficiency, in, his, schooling, would, always, remain, for, him, a, source, of, insecurity, in, 1791, joseph, ingres, took, his, son, to, toulouse, where, the, young, jean, auguste, dominique, was, enrolled, in, the, acad, mie, royale, de, peinture, sculpture, et, architecture, there, he, studied, under, the, sculptor, jean, pierre, vigan, the, landscape, painter, jean, briant, and, the, neoclassical, painter, guillaume, joseph, roques, roques, veneration, of, raphael, was, a, decisive, influence, on, the, young, artist, ingres, won, prizes, in, several, disciplines, such, as, composition, figure, and, antique, and, life, studies, his, musical, talent, was, developed, under, the, tutelage, of, the, violinist, lejeune, and, from, the, ages, of, thirteen, to, sixteen, he, played, second, violin, in, the, orchestre, du, capitole, de, toulouse, from, an, early, age, he, was, determined, to, be, a, history, painter, which, in, the, hierarchy, of, genres, established, by, the, royal, academy, of, painting, and, sculpture, under, louis, xiv, and, continued, well, into, the, 19th, century, was, considered, the, highest, level, of, painting, he, did, not, want, to, simply, make, portraits, or, illustrations, of, real, life, like, his, father, he, wanted, to, represent, the, heroes, of, religion, history, and, mythology, to, idealize, them, and, show, them, in, ways, that, explained, their, actions, rivaling, the, best, works, of, literature, and, philosophy, in, march, 1797, the, academy, awarded, ingres, first, prize, in, drawing, and, in, august, he, traveled, to, paris, to, study, in, the, studio, of, jacques, louis, david, france, s, and, europe, s, leading, painter, during, the, revolutionary, period, in, whose, studio, he, remained, for, four, years, ingres, followed, his, master, s, neoclassical, example, in, 1797, david, was, working, on, his, enormous, masterpiece, the, intervention, of, the, sabine, women, and, was, gradually, modifying, his, style, away, from, roman, models, of, rigorous, realism, to, the, ideals, of, purity, virtue, and, simplicity, in, greek, art, one, of, the, other, students, of, david, tienne, jean, del, cluze, who, later, became, an, art, critic, described, ingres, as, a, student, he, was, distinguished, not, just, by, the, candor, of, his, character, and, his, disposition, to, work, alone, he, was, one, of, the, most, studious, he, took, little, part, in, the, all, the, turbulent, follies, around, him, and, he, studied, with, more, perseverance, than, most, of, his, co, disciples, all, of, the, qualities, which, characterize, today, the, talent, of, this, artist, the, finesse, of, contour, the, true, and, profound, sentiment, of, the, form, and, a, modeling, with, extraordinary, correctness, and, firmness, could, already, be, seen, in, his, early, studies, while, several, of, his, comrades, and, david, himself, signaled, a, tendency, toward, exaggeration, in, his, studies, everyone, was, struck, by, his, grand, compositions, and, recognized, his, talent, he, was, admitted, to, the, painting, department, of, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, october, 1799, in, 1800, and, 1801, he, won, the, grand, prize, for, figure, painting, for, his, paintings, of, male, torsos, in, 1800, and, 1801, he, competed, for, the, prix, de, rome, the, highest, prize, of, the, academy, which, entitled, the, winner, to, four, years, of, residence, at, the, french, academy, in, rome, he, came, in, second, in, his, first, attempt, but, in, 1801, he, took, the, top, prize, with, the, ambassadors, of, agamemnon, in, the, tent, of, achilles, the, figures, of, the, envoys, in, the, right, of, the, painting, are, muscular, and, solid, as, statues, in, the, style, taught, by, david, but, the, two, main, figures, on, the, left, achilles, and, patroclus, are, mobile, vivid, and, graceful, like, figures, in, a, delicate, bas, relief, his, residence, in, rome, was, postponed, until, 1806, due, to, shortage, of, state, funds, in, the, meantime, he, worked, in, paris, alongside, several, other, students, of, david, in, a, studio, provided, by, the, state, and, further, developed, a, style, that, emphasized, purity, of, contour, he, found, inspiration, in, the, works, of, raphael, in, etruscan, vase, paintings, and, in, the, outline, engravings, of, the, english, artist, john, flaxman, his, drawings, of, hermaphrodite, and, the, nymph, salmacis, showed, a, new, stylized, ideal, of, female, beauty, which, would, reappear, later, in, his, jupiter, et, thetis, and, his, famous, nudes, in, 1802, he, made, his, debut, at, the, salon, with, portrait, of, a, woman, the, current, whereabouts, of, which, is, unknown, between, 1804, and, 1806, he, painted, a, series, of, portraits, which, were, striking, for, their, extreme, precision, particularly, in, the, richness, of, their, fabrics, and, tiny, details, these, included, the, portrait, of, philipbert, rivi, re, 1805, portrait, of, sabine, rivi, re, 1805, 06, portrait, of, madame, aymon, also, known, as, la, belle, z, lie, 1806, and, portrait, of, caroline, rivi, re, 1805, 06, the, female, faces, were, not, at, all, detailed, but, were, softened, and, were, notable, for, their, large, oval, eyes, and, delicate, flesh, colours, and, their, rather, dreamlike, expressions, his, portraits, typically, had, simple, backgrounds, of, solid, dark, or, light, colour, or, of, sky, these, were, the, beginning, of, a, series, that, would, make, him, among, the, most, celebrated, portrait, artists, of, the, 19th, century, as, ingres, waited, to, depart, to, rome, his, friend, lorenzo, bartolini, introduced, him, to, italian, renaissance, paintings, particularly, the, works, of, bronzino, and, pontormo, which, napoleon, had, brought, back, from, his, campaign, in, italy, and, placed, in, the, louvre, ingres, assimilated, their, clarity, and, monumentality, into, his, own, portrait, style, in, the, louvre, were, also, masterpieces, of, flemish, art, including, the, ghent, altarpiece, by, jan, van, eyck, which, the, french, army, had, seized, during, its, conquest, of, flanders, the, precision, of, renaissance, flemish, art, became, part, of, ingres, s, style, ingres, s, stylistic, eclecticism, represented, a, new, tendency, in, art, the, louvre, newly, filled, with, booty, seized, by, napoleon, in, his, campaigns, in, italy, and, the, low, countries, provided, french, artists, of, the, early, 19th, century, with, an, unprecedented, opportunity, to, study, compare, and, copy, masterworks, from, antiquity, and, from, the, entire, history, of, european, painting, as, art, historian, marjorie, cohn, has, written, at, the, time, art, history, as, a, scholarly, enquiry, was, brand, new, artists, and, critics, outdid, each, other, in, their, attempts, to, identify, interpret, and, exploit, what, they, were, just, beginning, to, perceive, as, historical, stylistic, developments, from, the, beginning, of, his, career, ingres, freely, borrowed, from, earlier, art, adopting, the, historical, style, appropriate, to, his, subject, and, was, consequently, accused, by, critics, of, plundering, the, past, in, 1803, he, received, a, prestigious, commission, being, one, of, five, artists, selected, along, with, jean, baptiste, greuze, robert, lef, vre, charles, meynier, and, marie, guillemine, benoist, to, paint, full, length, portraits, of, napoleon, bonaparte, as, first, consul, these, were, to, be, distributed, to, the, prefectural, towns, of, li, ge, antwerp, dunkerque, brussels, and, ghent, all, of, which, were, newly, ceded, to, france, in, the, 1801, treaty, of, lun, ville, napoleon, is, not, known, to, have, granted, the, artists, a, sitting, and, ingres, s, meticulously, painted, portrait, of, bonaparte, first, consul, appears, to, be, modelled, on, an, image, of, napoleon, painted, by, antoine, jean, gros, in, 1802, in, the, summer, of, 1806, ingres, became, engaged, to, marie, anne, julie, forestier, a, painter, and, musician, before, leaving, for, rome, in, september, although, he, had, hoped, to, stay, in, paris, long, enough, to, witness, the, opening, of, that, year, s, salon, in, which, he, was, to, display, several, works, he, reluctantly, left, for, italy, just, days, before, the, opening, ingres, painted, a, new, portrait, of, napoleon, for, presentation, at, the, 1806, salon, this, one, showing, napoleon, on, the, imperial, throne, for, his, coronation, this, painting, was, entirely, different, from, his, earlier, portrait, of, napoleon, as, first, consul, it, concentrated, almost, entirely, on, the, lavish, imperial, costume, that, napoleon, had, chosen, to, wear, and, the, symbols, of, power, he, held, the, scepter, of, charles, v, the, sword, of, charlemagne, the, rich, fabrics, furs, and, capes, crown, of, gold, leaves, golden, chains, and, emblems, were, all, presented, in, extremely, precise, detail, the, emperor, s, face, and, hands, were, almost, lost, in, the, majestic, costume, at, the, salon, his, paintings, self, portrait, portraits, of, the, rivi, re, family, and, napoleon, i, on, his, imperial, throne, received, a, very, chilly, reception, david, delivered, a, severe, judgement, and, the, critics, were, hostile, chaussard, le, pausanias, fran, ais, 1806, praised, the, fineness, of, ingres, s, brushwork, and, the, finish, but, condemned, ingres, s, style, as, gothic, and, asked, how, with, so, much, talent, a, line, so, flawless, an, attention, to, detail, so, thorough, has, m, ingres, succeeded, in, painting, a, bad, picture, the, answer, is, that, he, wanted, to, do, something, singular, something, extraordinary, m, ingres, s, intention, is, nothing, less, than, to, make, art, regress, by, four, centuries, to, carry, us, back, to, its, infancy, to, revive, the, manner, of, jean, de, bruges, newly, arrived, in, rome, ingres, read, with, mounting, indignation, the, relentlessly, negative, press, clippings, sent, to, him, from, paris, by, his, friends, in, letters, to, his, prospective, father, in, law, he, expressed, his, outrage, at, the, critics, so, the, salon, is, the, scene, of, my, disgrace, the, scoundrels, they, waited, until, i, was, away, to, assassinate, my, reputation, i, have, never, been, so, unhappy, i, knew, i, had, many, enemies, i, never, was, agreeable, with, them, and, never, will, be, my, greatest, wish, would, be, to, fly, to, the, salon, and, to, confound, them, with, my, works, which, don, t, in, any, way, resemble, theirs, and, the, more, i, advance, the, less, their, work, will, resemble, mine, he, vowed, never, again, to, exhibit, at, the, salon, and, his, refusal, to, return, to, paris, led, to, the, breaking, up, of, his, engagement, julie, forestier, when, asked, years, later, why, she, had, never, married, responded, when, one, has, had, the, honor, of, being, engaged, to, m, ingres, one, does, not, marry, on, 23, november, 1806, he, wrote, to, jean, forestier, the, father, of, his, former, fianc, e, yes, art, will, need, to, be, reformed, and, i, intend, to, be, that, revolutionary, characteristically, he, found, a, studio, on, the, grounds, of, the, villa, medici, away, from, the, other, resident, artists, and, painted, furiously, many, drawings, of, monuments, in, rome, from, this, time, are, attributed, to, ingres, but, it, appears, from, more, recent, scholarship, that, they, were, actually, the, work, of, his, collaborators, particularly, his, friend, the, landscape, artist, fran, ois, marius, granet, as, required, of, every, winner, of, the, prix, he, sent, works, at, regular, intervals, to, paris, so, his, progress, could, be, judged, traditionally, fellows, sent, paintings, of, male, greek, or, roman, heroes, but, for, his, first, samples, ingres, sent, baigneuse, mi, corps, 1807, a, painting, of, the, back, of, a, young, woman, bathing, based, on, an, engraving, of, an, antique, vase, and, la, grande, bagneuse, 1808, a, larger, painting, of, the, back, of, a, nude, bather, and, the, first, ingres, model, to, wear, a, turban, a, detail, he, borrowed, from, the, fornarina, by, his, favourite, painter, raphael, to, satisfy, the, academy, in, paris, he, also, dispatched, oedipus, and, the, sphinx, to, show, his, mastery, of, the, male, nude, the, verdict, of, the, academicians, in, paris, was, that, the, figures, were, not, sufficiently, idealized, in, later, years, ingres, painted, several, variants, of, these, compositions, another, nude, begun, in, 1807, the, venus, anadyomene, remained, in, an, unfinished, state, for, decades, to, be, completed, forty, years, later, and, finally, exhibited, in, 1855, during, his, time, in, rome, he, also, painted, numerous, portraits, madame, duvaucey, 1807, fran, ois, marius, granet, 1807, joseph, antoine, moltedo, 1810, madame, panckoucke, 1811, and, charles, joseph, laurent, cordier, 1811, in, 1812, he, painted, one, of, his, few, portraits, of, an, older, woman, comtesse, de, tournon, mother, of, the, prefect, of, rome, in, 1810, ingres, s, pension, at, the, villa, medici, ended, but, he, decided, to, stay, in, rome, and, seek, patronage, from, the, french, occupation, government, in, 1811, ingres, completed, his, final, student, exercise, the, immense, jupiter, and, thetis, a, scene, from, the, iliad, of, homer, the, goddess, of, the, sea, thetis, pleads, with, zeus, to, act, in, favor, of, her, son, achilles, the, face, of, the, water, nymph, salmacis, he, had, drawn, years, earlier, reappeared, as, thetis, ingres, wrote, with, enthusiasm, that, he, had, been, planning, to, paint, this, subject, since, 1806, and, he, intended, to, deploy, all, of, the, luxury, of, art, in, its, beauty, however, once, again, the, critics, were, hostile, finding, fault, with, the, exaggerated, proportions, of, the, figures, and, the, painting, s, flat, airless, quality, although, facing, uncertain, prospects, in, 1813, ingres, married, a, young, woman, madeleine, chapelle, recommended, to, him, by, her, friends, in, rome, after, a, courtship, carried, out, through, correspondence, he, proposed, without, having, met, her, and, she, accepted, their, marriage, was, happy, madame, ingres, s, faith, was, unwavering, he, continued, to, suffer, disparaging, reviews, as, don, pedro, of, toledo, kissing, henry, iv, s, sword, raphael, and, the, fornarina, fogg, art, museum, harvard, university, several, portraits, and, the, interior, of, the, sistine, chapel, met, with, generally, hostile, critical, response, at, the, paris, salon, of, 1814, after, he, left, the, academy, a, few, important, commissions, came, to, him, the, french, governor, of, rome, general, miollis, a, wealthy, patron, of, the, arts, asked, him, to, decorate, rooms, of, the, monte, cavallo, palace, a, former, papal, residence, for, an, expected, visit, of, napoleon, ingres, painted, a, large, scale, romulus, victory, over, acron, 1811, for, the, salon, of, the, empress, and, the, dream, of, ossian, 1813, based, on, a, book, of, poems, that, napoleon, admired, for, the, ceiling, of, the, emperor, s, bedroom, general, miollis, also, commissioned, ingres, to, paint, virgil, reading, the, aeneid, before, augustus, livia, and, octavia, 1812, for, his, own, residence, the, villa, aldobrandini, the, painting, shows, the, moment, when, virgil, reciting, his, work, to, the, emperor, augustus, his, wife, livia, and, his, sister, octavia, mentions, the, name, of, octavia, s, dead, son, marcellus, causing, octavia, to, faint, the, interior, was, precisely, depicted, following, the, archeological, finds, at, pompeii, as, usual, ingres, made, several, versions, of, the, same, scene, a, three, figure, fragment, cut, from, an, abandoned, version, is, in, the, royal, museums, of, fine, arts, of, belgium, in, brussels, and, in, 1825, he, made, a, chalk, drawing, in, vertical, format, as, a, model, for, a, reproductive, engraving, made, by, pradier, in, 1832, the, general, miollis, version, was, repurchased, by, ingres, in, the, 1830s, reworked, by, assistants, under, ingres, s, direction, and, never, finished, the, dream, of, ossian, was, likewise, repurchased, modified, but, left, unfinished, he, traveled, to, naples, in, the, spring, of, 1814, to, paint, queen, caroline, murat, joachim, murat, the, king, of, naples, had, earlier, purchased, the, dormeuse, de, naples, a, sleeping, nude, the, original, is, lost, but, several, drawings, exist, and, ingres, later, revisited, the, subject, in, l, odalisque, l, esclave, murat, also, commissioned, two, historical, paintings, raphael, et, la, fornarina, and, paolo, et, francesca, and, what, later, became, one, of, ingres, s, most, famous, works, la, grande, odalisque, to, accompany, dormeuse, de, naples, ingres, never, received, payment, due, to, the, collapse, of, the, murat, regime, and, execution, of, joachim, murat, in, 1815, with, the, fall, of, napoleon, s, dynasty, he, found, himself, essentially, stranded, in, rome, without, patronage, he, continued, to, produce, masterful, portraits, in, pencil, and, oils, of, almost, photographic, precision, but, with, the, departure, of, the, french, administration, the, painting, commissions, were, rare, during, this, low, point, of, his, career, ingres, augmented, his, income, by, drawing, pencil, portraits, of, the, many, wealthy, tourists, in, particular, the, english, passing, through, postwar, rome, for, an, artist, who, aspired, to, a, reputation, as, a, history, painter, this, seemed, menial, work, and, to, the, visitors, who, knocked, on, his, door, asking, is, this, where, the, man, who, draws, the, little, portraits, lives, he, would, answer, with, irritation, no, the, man, who, lives, here, is, a, painter, the, portrait, drawings, he, produced, in, such, profusion, during, this, period, rank, today, among, his, most, admired, works, he, is, estimated, to, have, made, some, five, hundred, portrait, drawings, including, portraits, of, his, famous, friends, his, friends, included, many, musicians, including, paganini, and, he, regularly, played, the, violin, with, others, who, shared, his, enthusiasm, for, mozart, haydn, gluck, and, beethoven, he, also, produced, a, series, of, small, paintings, in, what, was, known, as, the, troubador, style, idealized, portrayals, of, events, in, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, in, 1815, he, painted, aretino, and, charles, v, s, ambassador, as, well, as, aretino, and, tintoretto, an, anecdotal, painting, whose, subject, a, painter, brandishing, a, pistol, at, his, critic, may, have, been, especially, satisfying, to, the, embattled, ingres, other, paintings, in, the, same, style, included, henry, iv, playing, with, his, children, 1817, and, the, death, of, leonardo, in, 1816, ingres, produced, his, only, etching, a, portrait, of, the, french, ambassador, to, rome, monsignor, gabriel, cortois, de, pressigny, the, only, other, prints, he, is, known, to, have, executed, are, two, lithographs, the, four, magistrates, of, besan, on, made, as, an, illustration, for, baron, taylor, s, voyages, pittoresques, et, romantiques, dans, l, ancienne, france, and, a, copy, of, la, grande, odalisque, both, in, 1825, in, 1817, the, count, of, blacas, who, was, ambassador, of, france, to, the, holy, see, provided, ingres, with, his, first, official, commission, since, 1814, for, a, painting, of, christ, giving, the, keys, to, peter, completed, in, 1820, this, imposing, work, was, well, received, in, rome, but, to, the, artist, s, chagrin, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, there, would, not, permit, it, to, be, sent, to, paris, for, exhibition, a, commission, came, in, 1816, or, 1817, from, the, descendants, of, the, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, duke, of, alva, for, a, painting, of, the, duke, receiving, papal, honours, for, his, repression, of, the, protestant, reformation, ingres, loathed, the, subject, he, regarded, the, duke, as, one, of, history, s, brutes, and, struggled, to, satisfy, both, the, commission, and, his, conscience, after, revisions, which, eventually, reduced, the, duke, to, a, tiny, figure, in, the, background, ingres, left, the, work, unfinished, he, entered, in, his, diary, j, etais, forc, par, la, necessit, de, peindre, un, pareil, tableau, dieu, a, voulu, qu, il, reste, en, ebauche, i, was, forced, by, need, to, paint, such, a, painting, god, wanted, it, to, remain, a, sketch, he, continued, to, send, works, to, the, salon, in, paris, hoping, to, make, his, breakthrough, there, in, 1819, he, sent, his, reclining, nude, la, grande, odalisque, as, well, as, a, history, painting, philip, v, and, the, marshal, of, berwick, and, roger, freeing, angelica, based, on, an, episode, in, the,

odalisque, s, back, was, three, vertebrae, too, long, the, critic, charles, landon, wrote, after, a, moment, of, attention, one, sees, that, in, this, figure, there, are, no, bones, no, muscles, no, blood, no, life, no, relief, no, anything, which, constitutes, imitation, it, is, evident, that, the, artist, deliberately, erred, that, he, wanted, to, do, it, badly, that, he, believed, in, bringing, back, to, life, the, pure, and, primitive, manner, of, the, painters, of, antiquity, but, he, took, for, his, model, a, few, fragments, from, earlier, periods, and, a, degenerate, execution, and, completely, lost, his, way, in, 1820, ingres, and, his, wife, moved, to, florence, at, the, urging, of, the, florentine, sculptor, lorenzo, bartolini, an, old, friend, from, his, years, in, paris, he, still, had, to, depend, upon, his, portraits, and, drawings, for, income, but, his, luck, began, to, change, his, history, painting, roger, freeing, angelica, was, purchased, for, the, private, collection, of, louis, xviii, and, was, hung, in, the, mus, e, du, luxembourg, in, paris, which, was, newly, devoted, to, the, work, of, living, artists, this, was, the, first, work, of, ingres, to, enter, a, museum, in, 1821, he, finished, a, painting, commissioned, by, a, childhood, friend, monsieur, de, pastoret, the, entry, into, paris, of, the, dauphin, the, future, charles, v, de, pastoret, also, ordered, a, portrait, of, himself, and, a, religious, work, virgin, with, the, blue, veil, in, august, 1820, with, the, help, of, de, pastoret, he, received, a, commission, for, a, major, religious, painting, for, the, cathedral, of, montauban, the, theme, was, the, re, establishment, of, the, bond, between, the, church, and, the, state, ingres, s, painting, the, vow, of, louis, xiii, 1824, inspired, by, raphael, was, purely, in, the, renaissance, style, and, depicted, king, louis, xiii, vowing, to, dedicate, his, reign, to, the, virgin, mary, this, was, perfectly, in, tune, with, the, doctrine, of, the, new, government, of, the, restoration, he, spent, four, years, bringing, the, large, canvas, to, completion, and, he, took, it, to, the, paris, salon, in, october, 1824, where, it, became, the, key, that, finally, opened, the, door, of, the, paris, art, establishment, and, to, his, career, as, an, official, painter, the, vow, of, louis, xiii, in, the, salon, of, 1824, finally, brought, ingres, critical, success, although, stendhal, complained, about, the, sort, of, material, beauty, which, excludes, the, idea, of, divinity, most, critics, praised, the, work, the, journalist, and, future, prime, minister, and, french, president, adolphe, thiers, celebrated, the, breakthrough, of, a, new, style, nothing, is, better, than, variety, like, this, the, essential, character, of, the, new, style, in, january, 1825, ingres, was, awarded, the, cross, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, by, charles, x, and, in, june, 1825, he, was, elected, a, member, of, acad, mie, des,

reproduction, rights, twenty, times, the, amount, he, had, been, paid, for, the, original, painting, six, years, earlier, the, 1824, salon, also, brought, forward, a, counter, current, to, the, neoclassicism, of, ingres, eug, ne, delacroix, exhibited, les, massacres, de, scio, in, a, romantic, style, sharply, contrasting, to, that, of, ingres, the, success, of, ingres, s, painting, led, in, 1826, to, a, major, new, commission, the, apotheosis, of, homer, a, giant, canvas, which, celebrated, all, the, great, artists, of, history, intended, to, decorate, the, ceiling, of, one, of, the, halls, of, the, museum, charles, x, at, the, louvre, ingres, was, unable, to, finish, the, work, in, time, for, the, 1827, salon, but, displayed, the, painting, in, grisaille, the, 1827, salon, became, a, confrontation, between, the, neoclassicism, of, ingres, s, apotheosis, and, a, new, manifesto, of, romanticism, by, delacroix, the, death, of, sardanapalus, ingres, joined, the, battle, with, enthusiasm, he, called, delacroix, the, apostle, of, ugliness, and, told, friends, that, he, recognized, the, talent, the, honorable, character, and, distinguished, spirit, of, delacroix, but, that, he, has, tendencies, which, i, believe, are, dangerous, and, which, i, must, push, back, despite, the, considerable, patronage, he, enjoyed, under, the, bourbon, government, ingres, welcomed, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, that, the, outcome, of, the, revolution, was, not, a, republic, but, a, constitutional, monarchy, was, satisfactory, to, the, essentially, conservative, and, pacifistic, artist, who, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, in, august, 1830, criticized, agitators, who, still, want, to, soil, and, disturb, the, order, and, happiness, of, a, freedom, so, gloriously, so, divinely, won, ingres, s, career, was, little, affected, and, he, continued, to, receive, official, commissions, and, honors, under, the, july, monarchy, ingres, exhibited, in, the, salon, of, 1833, where, his, portrait, of, louis, fran, ois, bertin, 1832, was, a, particular, success, the, public, found, its, realism, spellbinding, although, some, of, the, critics, declared, its, naturalism, vulgar, and, its, colouring, drab, in, 1834, he, finished, a, large, religious, painting, the, martyrdom, of, saint, symphorian, which, depicted, the, first, saint, to, be, martyred, in, gaul, the, painting, was, commissioned, in, 1824, by, the, ministry, of, the, interior, for, the, cathedral, of, autun, and, the, iconography, in, the, picture, was, specified, by, the, bishop, ingres, conceived, the, painting, as, the, summation, of, all, of, his, work, and, skill, and, worked, on, it, for, ten, years, before, displaying, it, at, the, 1834, salon, he, was, surprised, shocked, and, angered, by, the, response, the, painting, was, attacked, by, both, the, neoclassicists, and, by, the, romantics, ingres, was, accused, of, historical, inaccuracy, for, the, colours, and, for, the, feminine, appearance, of, the, saint, who, looked, like, a, beautiful, statue, in, anger, ingres, announced, that, he, would, no, longer, accept, public, commissions, and, that, he, would, no, longer, participate, in, the, salon, he, later, did, participate, in, some, semi, public, expositions, and, a, retrospective, of, his, work, at, the, 1855, paris, international, exposition, but, never, again, took, part, in, the, salon, or, submitted, his, work, for, public, judgement, instead, at, the, end, of, 1834, he, returned, to, rome, to, become, the, director, of, the, academy, of, france, ingres, remained, in, rome, for, six, years, he, devoted, much, of, his, attention, to, the, training, of, the, painting, students, as, he, was, later, to, do, at, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, paris, he, re, organized, the, academy, increased, the, size, of, the, library, added, many, molds, of, classical, statues, to, the, academy, collection, and, assisted, the, students, in, getting, public, commissions, in, both, rome, and, paris, he, traveled, to, orvieto, 1835, siena, 1835, and, to, ravenna, and, urbino, to, study, the, paleochristian, mosaics, medieval, murals, and, renaissance, art, he, devoted, considerable, attention, to, music, one, of, the, subjects, of, the, academy, he, welcomed, franz, liszt, and, fanny, mendelssohn, he, formed, a, long, friendship, with, liszt, composer, charles, gounod, who, was, a, pensioner, at, the, time, at, the, academy, described, ingres, s, appreciation, of, modern, music, including, weber, and, berlioz, and, his, adoration, for, beethoven, haydn, mozart, and, gluck, he, joined, the, music, students, and, his, friend, niccol, paganini, in, playing, beethoven, s, violin, works, gounod, wrote, that, ingres, had, the, tenderness, of, an, infant, and, the, indignation, of, an, apostle, when, stendhal, visited, the, academy, and, disparaged, beethoven, ingres, turned, to, the, doorman, indicated, stendhal, and, told, him, if, this, gentleman, ever, calls, again, i, am, not, here, his, rancor, against, the, paris, art, establishment, for, his, failure, at, the, 1834, salon, did, not, abate, in, 1836, he, refused, a, major, commission, from, the, french, minister, of, the, interior, adolphe, thiers, to, decorate, the, interior, of, the, church, of, the, madeleine, in, paris, because, the, commission, had, been, offered, first, to, a, rival, paul, delaroche, who, refused, it, he, did, complete, a, small, number, of, works, which, he, sent, to, patrons, in, paris, one, was, l, odalisque, et, l, esclave, 1839, a, portrait, of, a, blonde, odalisque, or, member, of, a, harem, who, reclines, languorously, while, a, turbaned, musician, plays, this, fitted, into, the, popular, genre, of, orientalism, his, rival, eug, ne, delacroix, had, created, a, painting, on, a, similar, theme, les, femmes, d, alger, for, the, 1834, salon, the, setting, was, inspired, by, persian, miniatures, and, was, full, of, exotic, detail, but, the, woman, s, long, reclining, form, was, pure, ingres, the, critic, th, ophile, gautier, wrote, of, ingres, s, work, it, is, impossible, to, better, paint, the, mystery, the, silence, and, the, suffocating, atmosphere, of, the, seraglio, in, 1842, he, painted, a, second, version, nearly, identical, to, the, first, but, with, a, landscape, background, painted, by, his, student, paul, flandrin, the, second, painting, he, sent, in, 1840, was, the, illness, of, antiochus, 1840, also, known, as, aniochus, and, stratonice, a, history, painting, on, a, theme, of, love, and, sacrifice, a, theme, once, painted, by, david, in, 1800, when, ingres, was, in, his, studio, it, was, commissioned, by, the, duc, d, orleans, the, son, of, king, louis, philippe, i, and, had, very, elaborate, architectural, background, designed, by, one, of, the, academy, students, victor, baltard, the, future, architect, of, the, paris, market, les, halles, the, central, figure, was, an, ethereal, woman, in, white, whose, contemplative, pose, with, her, hand, on, her, chin, recurs, in, some, of, ingres, s, female, portraits, his, painting, of, aniochius, and, stratonice, despite, its, small, size, just, one, meter, was, a, major, success, for, ingres, in, august, it, was, shown, in, the, private, apartment, of, the, duc, d, orl, ans, in, the, pavilion, marsan, of, the, palais, des, tuileries, the, king, greeted, him, personally, at, versailles, and, gave, him, a, tour, of, the, palace, he, was, offered, a, commission, to, paint, a, portrait, of, the, duke, the, heir, to, the, throne, and, another, from, the, duc, de, lunyes, to, create, two, huge, murals, for, the, ch, teau, de, dampierre, in, april, 1841, he, returned, definitively, to, paris, one, of, the, first, works,

was, completed, in, 1842, ingres, received, commissions, to, make, additional, copies, he, also, received, a, commission, to, design, seventeen, stained, glass, windows, for, the, chapel, on, the,

of, rubens, which, he, believed, deviated, too, far, from, the, true, values, of, art, the, revolution, of, 1848, which, overthrew, louis, philippe, and, created, the, french, second, republic, had, little, effect, on, his, work, or, his, ideas, he, declared, that, the, revolutionaries, were, cannibals, who, called, themselves, french, but, during, the, revolution, completed, his, venus, anadyomene, which, he, had, started, as, an, academic, study, in, 1808, it, represented, venus, rising, from, the, sea, which, had, given, birth, to, her, surrounded, by, cherubs, he, welcomed, the, patronage, of, the, new, government, of, louis, napoleon, who, in, 1852, became, emperor, napoleon, iii, in, 1843, ingres, began, the, decorations, of, the, great, hall, in, the, ch, teau, de, dampierre, with, two, large, murals, the, golden, age, and, the, iron, age, illustrating, the, origins, of, art, he, made, more, than, five, hundred, preparatory, drawings, and, worked, on, the, enormous, project, for, six, years, in, an, attempt, to, imitate, the, effect, of, renaissance, frescos, he, chose, to, paint, the, murals, in, oil, on, plaster, which, created, technical, difficulties, work, on, the, iron, age, never, progressed, beyond, the, architectural, background, painted, by, an, assistant, meanwhile, the, growing, crowd, of, nudes, in, the, golden, age, discomfited, ingres, s, patron, the, duc, de, luynes, and, ingres, suspended, work, on, the, mural, in, 1847, ingres, was, devastated, by, the, loss, of, his, wife, who, died, on, 27, july, 1849, and,

may, 1871, when, the, paris, commune, set, fire, to, the, building, with, the, help, of, assistants, in, 1854, he, completed, another, history, painting, joan, of, arc, at, the, coronation, of, charles, vii, a, retrospective, of, his, works, was, featured, at, the, paris, universal, exposition, of, 1855, and, in, the, same, year, napoleon, iii, named, him, a, grand, officer, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, in, 1862, he, was, awarded, the, title, of, senator, and, made, a, member, of, the, imperial, council, on, public, instruction, three, of, his, works, were, shown, in, the, london, international, exhibition, and, his, reputation, as, a, major, french, painter, was, confirmed, once, more, he, continued, to, rework, and, refine, his, classic, themes, in, 1856, ingres, completed,

in, the, painting, is, the, red, of, his, rosette, of, the, legion, of, honour, near, the, end, of, his, life, he, made, one, of, his, best, known, masterpieces, the, turkish, bath, it, reprised, a, figure, and, theme, he, had, been, painting, since, 1828, with, his, petite, baigneuse, originally, completed, in, a, square, format, in, 1852, and, sold, to, prince, napoleon, in, 1859, it, was, returned, to, the, artist, soon, afterward, according, to, a, legend, princess, clothilde, was, shocked, by, the, abundant, nudity, after, reworking, the, painting, as, a, tondo, ingres, signed, and, dated, it, in, 1862, although, he, made, additional, revisions, in, 1863, the, painting, was, eventually, purchased, by, a, turkish, diplomat, khalid, bey, who, owned, a, large, collection, of, nudes, and, erotic, art, including, several, paintings, by, courbet, the, painting, continued, to, cause, a, scandal, long, after, ingres, was, dead, it, was, initially, offered, to, the, louvre, in, 1907, but, was, rejected, before, being, given, to, the, louvre, in, 1911, ingres, died, of, pneumonia, on, 14, january, 1867, at, the, age, of, eighty, six, in, his, apartment, on, the, quai, voltaire, in, paris, he, is, interred, in, the, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, with, a, tomb, sculpted, by, his, student, jean, marie, bonnassieux, the, contents, of, his, studio, including, a, number, of, major, paintings, over, 4000, drawings, and, his, violin, were, bequeathed, by, the, artist, to, the, city, museum, of, montauban, now, known, as, the, mus, e, ingres, ingres, s, style, was, formed, early, in, life, and, changed, comparatively, little, his, earliest, drawings, such, as, the, portrait, of, a, man, or, portrait, of, an, unknown, 3, july, 1797, now, in, the, louvre, already, show, a, suavity, of, outline, and, an, extraordinary, control, of, the, parallel, hatchings, which, model, the, forms, from, the, first, his, paintings, are, characterized, by, a, firmness, of, outline, reflecting, his, often, quoted, conviction, that, drawing, is, the, probity, of, art, he, believed, colour, to, be, no, more, than, an, accessory, to, drawing, explaining, drawing, is, not, just, reproducing, contours, it, is, not, just, the, line, drawing, is, also, the, expression, the, inner, form, the, composition, the, modelling, see, what, is, left, after, that, drawing, is, seven, eighths, of, what, makes, up, painting, the, art, historian, jean, clay, said, ingres, proceeded, always, from, certitude, to, certitude, with, the, result, that, even, his, freest, sketches, reveal, the, same, kind, of, execution, as, that, found, in, the, final, works, in, depicting, the, human, body, he, disregarded, rules, of, anatomy, which, he, termed, a, dreadful, science, that, i, cannot, think, of, without, disgust, in, his, quest, for, a, sinuous, arabesque, abhorring, the, visible, brushstroke, ingres, made, no, recourse, to, the, shifting, effects, of, colour, and, light, on, which, the, romantic, school, depended, he, preferred, local, colours, only, faintly, modelled, in, light, by, half, tones, ce, que, l, on, sait, he, would, repeat, il, faut, le, savoir, l, p, e, la, main, whatever, you, know, you, must, know, it, with, sword, in, hand, ingres, thus, left, himself, without, the, means, of, producing, the, necessary, unity, of, effect, when, dealing, with, crowded, compositions, such, as, the, apotheosis, of, homer, and, the, martyrdom, of, saint, symphorian, among, ingres, s, historical, and, mythological, paintings, the, most, satisfactory, are, usually, those, depicting, one, or, two, figures, such, as, oedipus, the, half, length, bather, odalisque, and, the, spring, subjects, only, animated, by, the, consciousness, of, perfect, physical, well, being, in, roger, freeing, angelica, the, female, nude, seems, merely, juxtaposed, with, the, meticulously, rendered, but, inert, figure, of, roger, flying, to, the, rescue, on, his, hippogriff, for, ingres, was, rarely, successful, in, the, depiction, of, movement, and, drama, according, to, sanford, schwartz, the, historical, mythological, and, religious, pictures, bespeak, huge, amounts, of, energy, and, industry, but, conveying, little, palpable, sense, of, inner, tension, are, costume, dramas, the, faces, in, the, history, pictures, are, essentially, those, of, models, waiting, for, the, session, to, be, over, when, an, emotion, is, to, be, expressed, it, comes, across, stridently, or, woodenly, ingres, was, averse, to, theories, and, his, allegiance, to, classicism, with, its, emphasis, on, the, ideal, the, generalized, and, the, regular, was, tempered, by, his, love, of, the, particular, he, believed, that, the, secret, of, beauty, has, to, be, found, through, truth, the, ancients, did, not, create, they, did, not, make, they, recognized, in, many, of, ingres, s, works, there, is, a, collision, between, the, idealized, and, the, particular, that, creates, what, robert, rosenblum, termed, an, oil, and, water, sensation, this, contradiction, is, vivid, in, cherubini, and, the, muse, of, lyric, poetry, 1842, for, example, in, which, the, realistically, painted, 81, year, old, composer, is, attended, by, an, idealized, muse, in, classical, drapery, ingres, s, choice, of, subjects, reflected, his, literary, tastes, which, were, severely, limited, he, read, and, reread, homer, virgil, plutarch, dante, histories, and, the, lives, of, the, artists, throughout, his, life, he, revisited, a, small, number, of, favourite, themes, and, painted, multiple, versions, of, many, of, his, major, compositions, he, did, not, share, his, age, s, enthusiasm, for, battle, scenes, and, generally, preferred, to, depict, moments, of, revelation, or, intimate, decision, manifested, by, meeting, or, confrontation, but, never, by, violence, his, numerous, odalisque, paintings, were, influenced, to, a, great, extent, by, the, writings, of, mary, wortley, montagu, the, wife, of, the, ambassador, to, turkey, whose, diaries, and, letters, when, published, fascinated, european, society, although, capable, of, painting, quickly, he, often, laboured, for, years, over, a, painting, ingres, s, pupil, amaury, duval, wrote, of, him, with, this, facility, of, execution, one, has, trouble, explaining, why, ingres, oeuvre, is, not, still, larger, but, he, scraped, out, frequently, never, being, satisfied, and, perhaps, this, facility, itself, made, him, rework, whatever, dissatisfied, him, certain, that, he, had, the, power, to, repair, the, fault, and, quickly, too, ingres, s, venus, anadyomene, was, begun, in, 1807, but, not, completed, until, 1848, after, a, long, hiatus, resulting, from, his, indecision, about, the, position, of, the, arms, the, source, 1856, had, a, similar, history, it, was, begun, in, the, 1820s, as, a, sketch, of, such, simplicity, that, one, would, suppose, she, had, been, painted, in, a, single, stroke, according, to, amaury, duval, who, believed, that, ingres, reworking, of, the, painting, in, 1855, was, a, loss, while, ingres, believed, that, history, painting, was, the, highest, form, of, art, his, modern, reputation, rests, largely, upon, the, exceptional, quality, of, his, portraits, by, the, time, of, his, retrospective, at, the, exposition, universelle, in, 1855, an, emerging, consensus, viewed, his, portrait, paintings, as, his, masterpieces, their, consistently, high, quality, belies, ingres, s, often, stated, complaint, that, the, demands, of, portraiture, robbed, him, of, time, he, could, have, spent, painting, historical, subjects, baudelaire, called, him, the, sole, man, in, france, who, truly, makes, portraits, the, portraits, of, m, bertin, m, mol, and, mme, d, haussonville, are, true, portraits, that, is, the, ideal, reconstruction, of, individuals, a, good, portrait, seems, to, me, always, as, a, biography, dramatized, his, most, famous, portrait, is, that, of, louis, fran, ois, bertin, the, chief, editor, of, the, journal, des, debats, which, was, widely, admired, when, it, was, exhibited, at, the, 1833, salon, ingres, had, originally, planned, to, paint, bertin, standing, but, many, hours, of, effort, ended, in, a, creative, impasse, before, he, decided, on, a, seated, pose, douard, manet, described, the, resulting, portrait, as, the, buddha, of, the, bourgeoisie, the, portrait, quickly, became, a, symbol, of, the, rising, economic, and, political, power, of, bertin, s, social, class, for, his, female, portraits, he, often, posed, the, subject, after, a, classical, statue, the, famous, portrait, of, the, comtesse, de, haussonville, may, have, been, modeled, after, a, roman, statue, called, pudicity, modesty, in, the, vatican, collection, another, trick, that, ingres, used, was, to, paint, the, fabrics, and, details, in, the, portraits, with, extreme, precision, and, accuracy, but, to, idealize, the, face, the, eye, of, the, viewer, would, perceive, the, fabrics, as, realistic, and, would, assume, the, face, was, equally, true, his, portraits, of, women, range, from, the, warmly, sensuous, madame, de, senonnes, 1814, to, the, realistic, mademoiselle, jeanne, gonin, 1821, the, junoesque, marie, clothilde, in, s, de, foucauld, madame, moitessier, portrayed, standing, and, seated, 1851, and, 1856, and, the, chilly, jos, phine, el, onore, marie, pauline, de, galard, de, brassac, de, b, arn, princesse, de, broglie, 1853, drawing, was, the, foundation, of, ingres, s, art, in, the, ecole, des, beaux, arts, he, excelled, at, figure, drawing, winning, the, top, prizes, during, his, years, in, rome, and, florence, he, made, hundreds, of, drawings, of, family, friends, and, visitors, many, of, them, of, very, high, portrait, quality, he, never, began, a, painting, without, first, resolving, the, drawing, usually, with, a, long, series, of, drawing, in, which, he, refined, the, composition, in, the, case, of, his, large, history, paintings, each, figure, in, the, painting, was, the, subject, of, numerous, sketches, and, studies, as, he, tried, different, poses, he, demanded, that, his, students, at, the, academy, and, the, ecole, des, beaux, arts, perfect, their, drawing, before, anything, else, he, declared, that, a, thing, well, drawn, is, always, a, thing, well, painted, his, portrait, drawings, of, which, about, 450, are, extant, are, today, among, his, most, admired, works, while, a, disproportionate, number, of, them, date, from, his, difficult, early, years, in, italy, he, continued, to, produce, portrait, drawings, of, his, friends, until, the, end, of, his, life, agnes, mongan, has, written, of, the, portrait, drawings, before, his, departure, in, the, fall, of, 1806, from, paris, for, rome, the, familiar, characteristics, of, his, drawing, style, were, well, established, the, delicate, yet, firm, contour, the, definite, yet, discreet, distortions, of, form, the, almost, uncanny, capacity, to, seize, a, likeness, in, the, precise, yet, lively, delineation, of, features, the, preferred, materials, were, also, already, established, the, sharply, pointed, graphite, pencil, on, a, smooth, white, paper, so, familiar, to, us, are, both, the, materials, and, the, manner, that, we, forget, how, extraordinary, they, must, have, seemed, at, the, time, ingres, manner, of, drawing, was, as, new, as, the, century, it, was, immediately, recognized, as, expert, and, admirable, if, his, paintings, were, sternly, criticized, as, gothic, no, comparable, criticism, was, leveled, at, his, drawings, his, student, raymond, balze, described, ingres, s, working, routine, in, executing, his, portrait, drawings, each, of, which, required, four, hours, as, an, hour, and, a, half, in, the, morning, then, two, and, a, half, hours, in, the, afternoon, he, very, rarely, retouched, it, the, next, day, he, often, told, me, that, he, got, the, essence, of, the, portrait, while, lunching, with, the, model, who, off, guard, became, more, natural, the, resulting, drawings, according, to, john, canaday, revealed, the, sitters, personalities, by, means, so, subtle, and, so, free, of, cruelty, that, ingres, could, expose, the, vanities, of, a, fop, a, silly, woman, or, a, windbag, in, drawings, that, delighted, them, ingres, drew, his, portrait, drawings, on, wove, paper, which, provided, a, smooth, surface, very, different, from, the, ribbed, surface, of, laid, paper, which, is, nevertheless, sometimes, referred, to, today, as, ingres, paper, the, early, drawings, are, characterized, by, very, taut, contours, drawn, with, sharply, pointed, graphite, while, later, drawings, show, freer, lines, and, more, emphatic, modeling, drawn, with, a, softer, blunter, graphite, drawings, made, in, preparation, for, paintings, such, as, the, many, studies, for, the, martyrdom, of, st, symphorian, and, the, golden, age, are, more, varied, in, size, and, treatment, than, are, the, portrait, drawings, it, was, his, usual, practice, to, make, many, drawings, of, nude, models, in, search, of, the, most, eloquent, gesture, before, making, another, series, of, drawings, for, the, draperies, in, his, early, years, he, sometimes, had, his, model, pose, behind, a, translucent, veil, that, suppressed, details, and, emphasized, the, arabesque, he, often, used, female, models, when, testing, poses, for, male, figures, as, he, did, in, drawings, for, jesus, among, the, doctors, nude, studies, exist, even, for, some, of, his, commissioned, portraits, but, these, were, drawn, using, hired, models, ingres, drew, a, number, of, landscape, views, while, in, rome, but, he, painted, only, one, pure, landscape, the, small, tondo, raphael, s, casino, although, two, other, small, landscape, tondos, are, sometimes, attributed, to, him, for, ingres, colour, played, an, entirely, secondary, role, in, art, he, wrote, colour, adds, ornament, to, a, painting, but, it, is, nothing, but, the, handmaiden, because, all, it, does, is, to, render, more, agreeable, the, true, perfections, of, the, art, rubens, and, van, dyck, can, be, pleasing, at, first, sight, but, they, are, deceptive, they, are, from, the, poor, school, of, colourists, the, school, of, deception, never, use, bright, colours, they, are, anti, historic, it, is, better, to, fall, into, gray, than, to, into, bright, colours, the, institute, in, paris, complained, in, 1838, that, the, students, of, ingres, in, rome, had, a, deplorable, lack, of, knowledge, of, the, truth, and, power, of, colour, and, a, knowledge, of, the, different, effects, of, light, a, dull, and, opaque, effect, is, found, in, all, their, canvases, they, seem, to, have, only, been, lit, by, twilight, the, poet, and, critic, baudelaire, observed, the, students, of, m, ingres, have, very, uselessly, avoided, any, semblance, of, colour, they, believe, or, pretend, to, believe, that, they, are, not, needed, in, painting, ingres, s, own, paintings, vary, considerably, in, their, use, of, colour, and, critics, were, apt, to, fault, them, as, too, grey, or, contrarily, too, jarring, baudelaire, who, said, m, ingres, adores, colour, like, a, fashionable, milliner, wrote, of, the, portraits, of, louis, fran, ois, bertin, and, madame, d, haussonville, open, your, eyes, nation, of, simpletons, and, tell, us, if, you, ever, saw, such, dazzling, eye, catching, painting, or, even, a, greater, elaboration, of, colour, ingres, s, paintings, are, often, characterized, by, strong, local, colours, such, as, the, acid, blues, and, bottle, greens, kenneth, clark, professed, to, perversely, enjoy, in, la, grande, odalisque, in, other, works, especially, in, his, less, formal, portraits, such, as, the, mademoiselle, jeanne, suzanne, catherine, gonin, 1821, colour, is, restrained, ingres, and, delacroix, became, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, most, prominent, representatives, of, the, two, competing, schools, of, art, in, france, neoclassicism, and, romanticism, neo, classicism, was, based, in, large, part, on, the, philosophy, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, 1717, 1768, who, wrote, that, art, should, embody, noble, simplicity, and, calm, grandeur, many, painters, followed, this, course, including, fran, ois, g, rard, antoine, jean, gros, anne, louis, girodet, and, jacques, louis, david, the, teacher, of, ingres, a, competing, school, romanticism, emerged, first, in, germany, and, moved, quickly, to, france, it, rejected, the, idea, of, the, imitation, of, classical, styles, which, it, described, as, gothic, and, primitive, the, romanticists, in, french, painting, were, led, by, th, odore, g, ricault, and, especially, delacroix, the, rivalry, first, emerged, at, the, paris, salon, of, 1824, where, ingres, exhibited, the, vow, of, louis, xiii, inspired, by, raphael, while, delacroix, showed, the, massacre, at, chios, depicting, a, tragic, event, in, the, greek, war, of, independence, ingres, s, painting, was, calm, static, and, carefully, constructed, while, the, work, of, delacroix, was, turbulent, full, of, motion, colour, and, emotion, the, dispute, between, the, two, painters, and, schools, reappeared, at, the, 1827, salon, where, ingres, presented, l, apotheose, d, homer, an, example, of, classical, balance, and, harmony, while, delacroix, showed, the, death, of, sardanapalus, another, glittering, and, tumultuous, scene, of, violence, the, duel, between, the, two, painters, each, considered, the, best, of, his, school, continued, over, the, years, paris, artists, and, intellectuals, were, passionately, divided, by, the, conflict, although, modern, art, historians, tend, to, regard, ingres, and, other, neoclassicists, as, embodying, the, romantic, spirit, of, their, time, at, the, 1855, universal, exposition, both, delacroix, and, ingres, were, well, represented, the, supporters, of, delacroix, and, the, romantics, heaped, abuse, on, the, work, of, ingres, the, brothers, goncourt, described, the, miserly, talent, of, ingres, faced, with, history, m, ingres, calls, vainly, to, his, assistance, a, certain, wisdom, decency, convenience, correction, and, a, reasonable, dose, of, the, spiritual, elevation, that, a, graduate, of, a, college, demands, he, scatters, persons, around, the, center, of, the, action, tosses, here, and, there, an, arm, a, leg, a, head, perfectly, drawn, and, thinks, that, his, job, is, done, baudelaire, also, previously, sympathetic, toward, ingres, shifted, toward, delacroix, m, ingres, can, be, considered, a, man, gifted, with, high, qualities, an, eloquent, evoker, of, beauty, but, deprived, of, the, energetic, temperament, which, creates, the, fatality, of, genius, delacroix, himself, was, merciless, toward, ingres, describing, the, exhibition, of, works, by, ingres, at, the, 1855, exposition, he, called, it, ridiculous, presented, as, one, knows, in, a, rather, pompous, fashion, it, is, the, complete, expression, of, an, incomplete, intelligence, effort, and, pretension, are, everywhere, nowhere, is, there, found, a, spark, of, the, natural, according, to, ingres, student, paul, chenavard, later, in, their, careers, ingres, and, delacroix, accidentally, met, on, the, steps, of, the, french, institute, ingres, put, his, hand, out, and, the, two, shook, amicably, ingres, was, a, conscientious, teacher, and, was, greatly, admired, by, his, students, the, best, known, of, them, is, th, odore, chass, riau, who, studied, with, him, from, 1830, as, a, precocious, eleven, year, old, until, ingres, closed, his, studio, in, 1834, to, return, to, rome, ingres, considered, chass, riau, his, truest, disciple, even, predicting, according, to, an, early, biographer, that, he, would, be, the, napoleon, of, painting, by, the, time, chass, riau, visited, ingres, in, rome, in, 1840, however, the, younger, artist, s, growing, allegiance, to, the, romantic, style, of, delacroix, was, apparent, leading, ingres, to, disown, his, favourite, student, of, whom, he, subsequently, spoke, rarely, and, censoriously, no, other, artist, who, studied, under, ingres, succeeded, in, establishing, a, strong, identity, among, the, most, notable, of, them, were, jean, hippolyte, flandrin, henri, lehmann, and, eug, ne, emmanuel, amaury, duval, ingres, s, influence, on, later, generations, of, artists, was, considerable, one, of, his, heirs, was, degas, who, studied, under, louis, lamothe, a, minor, disciple, of, ingres, in, the, 20th, century, his, influence, was, even, stronger, picasso, and, matisse, were, among, those, who, acknowledged, a, debt, to, ingres, matisse, described, him, as, the, first, painter, to, use, pure, colours, outlining, them, without, distorting, them, the, startling, effects, of, ingres, s, paintings, the, collapsing, of, traditional, depth, and, perspective, and, the, presentation, of, figures, like, the, figures, in, a, deck, of, cards, were, criticized, in, the, 19th, century, but, were, welcomed, by, the, avant, garde, in, the, 20th, century, an, important, retrospective, of, works, by, ingres, was, held, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, in, 1905, which, was, visited, by, picasso, matisse, and, many, other, artists, the, original, and, striking, composition, of, the, turkish, bath, shown, for, the, first, time, in, public, had, a, visible, influence, on, the, composition, and, poses, of, the, figures, in, picasso, s, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, in, 1907, the, exhibit, also, included, many, of, his, studies, for, the, unfinished, mural, l, age, d, or, including, a, striking, drawing, of, women, gracefully, dancing, in, a, circle, matisse, produced, his, own, version, on, this, composition, in, his, painting, la, danse, in, 1909, the, particular, pose, and, colouring, of, ingres, s, portrait, of, monsieur, bertin, also, made, a, reappearance, in, picasso, s, portrait, of, gertrude, stein, 1906, barnett, newman, credited, ingres, as, a, progenitor, of, abstract, expressionism, explaining, that, guy, was, an, abstract, painter, he, looked, at, the, canvas, more, often, than, at, the, model, kline, de, kooning, none, of, us, would, have, existed, without, him, pierre, barousse, the, curator, of, the, mus, e, ingres, wrote, one, realizes, in, how, many, ways, a, variety, of, artists, claim, him, as, their, master, from, the, most, plainly, conventional, of, the, nineteenth, century, such, as, cabanel, or, bouguereau, to, the, most, revolutionary, of, our, century, from, matisse, to, picasso, a, classicist, above, all, he, was, moved, by, the, impulse, to, penetrate, the, secret, of, natural, beauty, and, to, reinterpret, it, through, its, own, means, an, attitude, fundamentally, different, to, that, of, david, there, results, a, truly, personal, and, unique, art, admired, as, much, by, the, cubists, for, its, plastic, autonomy, as, by, the, surrealists, for, its, visionary, qualities, ingres, is, one, of, the, most, cited, artists, in, the, interpictural, compositions, of, the, peruvian, painter, herman, braun, vega, the, latter, dedicated, an, entire, exhibition, to, him, in, 2006, on, the, occasion, of, the, year, dedicated, to, ingres, in, france, museums, ingres, s, well, known, passion, for, playing, the, violin, gave, rise, to, a, common, expression, in, the, french, language, violon, d, ingres, meaning, a, second, skill, beyond, the, one, by, which, a, person, is, mainly, known, ingres, was, an, amateur, violin, player, from, his, youth, and, played, for, a, time, as, second, violinist, for, the, orchestra, of, toulouse, when, he, was, director, of, the, french, academy, in, rome, he, played, frequently, with, the, music, students, and, guest, artists, charles, gounod, who, was, a, student, under, ingres, at, the, academy, merely, noted, that, he, was, not, a, professional, even, less, a, virtuoso, along, with, the, student, musicians, he, performed, beethoven, string, quartets, with, niccol, paganini, in, an, 1839, letter, franz, liszt, described, his, playing, as, charming, and, planned, to, play, through, all, the, mozart, and, beethoven, violin, sonatas, with, ingres, liszt, also, dedicated, his, transcriptions, of, the, 5th, and, 6th, symphonies, of, beethoven, to, ingres, on, their, original, publication, in, 1840, the, american, avant, garde, artist, man, ray, used, this, expression, as, the, title, of, a, famous, photograph, portraying, alice, prin, aka, kiki, de, montparnasse, in, the, pose, of, the, valpin, on, bather, with, two, f, holes, painted, on, to, make, her, body, resemble, a, violin
