and, bertrand, de, poulengy, meanwhile, she, was, summoned, to, nancy, under, safe, conduct, by, charles, ii, duke, of, lorraine, who, had, heard, about, joan, during, her, stay, at, vaucouleurs, the, duke, was, ill, and, thought, she, might, have, supernatural, powers, that, could, cure, him, she, offered, no, cures, but, reprimanded, him, for, living, with, his, mistress, henry, v, s, brothers,

doing, so, at, reims, would, help, legitimize, his, claim, to, the, throne, in, july, 1428, the, english, had, started, to, surround, orl, ans, and, had, nearly, isolated, it, from, the, rest, of, charles, s, territory, by, capturing, many, of, the, smaller, bridge, towns, on, the, loire, river, orl, ans, was, strategically, important, as, the, last, obstacle, to, an, assault, on, the, remainder, of, charles, s, territory, according, to, joan, s, later, testimony, it, was, around, this, period, that, her, visions, told, her, to, leave, domr, my, to, help, the, dauphin, charles, baudricourt, agreed, to, a, third, meeting, with, joan, in, february, 1429, around, the, time, the, english, captured, an, armagnac, relief, convoy, at, the, battle, of, the, herrings, during, the, siege, of, orl, ans, their, conversations, along, with, metz, and, poulengy, s, support, convinced, baudricourt, to, allow, her, to, go, to, chinon, for, an, audience, with, the, dauphin, joan, traveled, with, an, escort, of, six, soldiers, before, leaving, joan, put, on, men, s, clothes, which, were, provided, by, her, escorts, and, the, people, of, vaucouleurs, she, continued, to, wear, men, s, clothes, for, the, remainder, of, her, life, charles, vii, met, joan, for, the, first, time, at, the, royal, court, in, chinon, in, late, february, or, early, march, 1429, when, she, was, seventeen, and, he, was, twenty, six, she, told, him, that, she, had, come, to, raise, the, siege, of, orl, ans, and, to, lead, him, to, reims, for, his, coronation, they, had, a, private, exchange, that, made, a, strong, impression, on, charles, jean, pasquerel, joan, s, confessor, later, testified, that, joan, told, him, she, had, reassured, the, dauphin, that, he, was, charles, vi, s, son, and, the, legitimate, king, charles, and, his, council, needed, more, assurance, sending, joan, to, poitiers, to, be, examined, by, a, council, of, theologians, who, declared, that, she, was, a, good, person, and, a, good, catholic, they, did, not, render, a, decision, on, the, source, of, joan, s, inspiration, but, agreed, that, sending, her, to, orl, ans, could, be, useful, to, the, king, and, would, test, whether, her, inspiration, was, of, divine, origin, joan, was, then, sent, to, tours, to, be, physically, examined, by, women, directed, by, charles, s, mother, in, law, yolande, of, aragon, who, verified, her, virginity, this, was, to, establish, if, she, could, indeed, be, the, prophesied, virgin, savior, of, france, to, show, the, purity, of, her, devotion, and, to, ensure, she, had, not, consorted, with, the, devil, the, dauphin, reassured, by, the, results, of, these, tests, commissioned, plate, armor, for, her, she, designed, her, own, banner, and, had, a, sword, brought, to, her, from, under, the, altar, in, the, church, at, sainte, catherine, de, fierbois, around, this, time, she, began, calling, herself, joan, the, maiden, emphasizing, her, virginity, as, a, sign, of, her, mission, before, joan, s, arrival, at, chinon, the, armagnac, strategic, situation, was, bad, but, not, hopeless, the, armagnac, forces, were, prepared, to, endure, a, prolonged, siege, at, orl, ans, the, burgundians, had, recently, withdrawn, from, the, siege, due, to, disagreements, about, territory, and, the, english, were, debating, whether, to, continue, nonetheless, after, almost, a, century, of, war, the, armagnacs, were, demoralized, once, joan, joined, the, dauphin, s, cause, her, personality, began, to, raise, their, spirits, inspiring, devotion, and, the, hope, of, divine, assistance, her, belief, in, the, divine, origin, of, her, mission, turned, the, longstanding, anglo, french, conflict, over, inheritance, into, a, religious, war, before, beginning, the, journey, to, orl, ans, joan, dictated, a, letter, to, the, duke, of, bedford, warning, him, that, she, was, sent, by, god, to, drive, him, out, of, france, in, the, last, week, of, april, 1429, joan, set, out, from, blois, as, part, of, an, army, carrying, supplies, for, the, relief, of, orl, ans, she, arrived, there, on, 29, april, and, met, the, commander, jean, de, dunois, the, bastard, of, orl, ans, orl, ans, was, not, completely, cut, off, and, dunois, got, her, into, the, city, where, she, was, greeted, enthusiastically, joan, was, initially, treated, as, a, figurehead, to, raise, morale, flying, her, banner, on, the, battlefield, she, was, not, given, any, formal, command, or, included, in, military, councils, but, quickly, gained, the, support, of, the, armagnac, troops, she, always, seemed, to, be, present, where, the, fighting, was, most, intense, she, frequently, stayed, with, the, front, ranks, and, she, gave, them, a, sense, she, was, fighting, for, their, salvation, armagnac, commanders, would, sometimes, accept, the, advice, she, gave, them, such, as, deciding, what, position, to, attack, when, to, continue, an, assault, and, how, to, place, artillery, on, 4, may, the, armagnacs, went, on, the, offensive, attacking, the, outlying, bastille, de, saint, loup, fortress, of, saint, loup, once, joan, learned, of, the, attack, she, rode, out, with, her, banner, to, the, site, of, the, battle, a, mile, east, of, orl, ans, she, arrived, as, the, armagnac, soldiers, were, retreating, after, a, failed, assault, her, appearance, rallied, the, soldiers, who, attacked, again, and, took, the, fortress, on, 5, may, no, combat, occurred, since, it, was, ascension, thursday, a, feast, day, she, dictated, another, letter, to, the, english, warning, them, to, leave, france, and, had, it, tied, to, a, bolt, which, was, fired, by, a, crossbowman, the, armagnacs, resumed, their, offensive, on, 6, may, capturing, saint, jean, le, blanc, which, the, english, had, deserted, the, armagnac, commanders, wanted, to, stop, but, joan, encouraged, them, to, launch, an, assault, on, les, augustins, an, english, fortress, built, around, a, monastery, after, its, capture, the, armagnac, commanders, wanted, to, consolidate, their, gains, but, joan, again, argued, for, continuing, the, offensive, on, the, morning, of, 7, may, the, armagnacs, attacked, the, main, english, stronghold, les, tourelles, joan, was, wounded, by, an, arrow, between, the, neck, and, shoulder, while, holding, her, banner, in, the, trench, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, but, later, returned, to, encourage, the, final, assault, that, took, the, fortress, the, english, retreated, from, orl, ans, on, 8, may, ending, the, siege, at, chinon, joan, had, declared, that, she, was, sent, by, god, at, poitiers, when, she, was, asked, to, show, a, sign, demonstrating, this, claim, she, replied, that, it, would, be, given, if, she, were, brought, to, orl, ans, the, lifting, of, the, siege, was, interpreted, by, many, people, to, be, that, sign, prominent, clergy, such, as, jacques, g, lu, archbishop, of, embrun, and, the, theologian, jean, gerson, wrote, treatises, in, support, of, joan, after, this, victory, in, contrast, the, english, saw, the, ability, of, this, peasant, girl, to, defeat, their, armies, as, proof, she, was, possessed, by, the, devil, after, the, success, at, orl, ans, joan, insisted, that, the, armagnac, forces, should, advance, promptly, toward, reims, to, crown, the, dauphin, charles, allowed, her, to, accompany, the, army, under, the, command, of, john, ii, duke, of, alen, on, who, collaboratively, worked, with, joan, and, regularly, heeded, her, advice, before, advancing, toward, reims, the, armagnacs, needed, to, recapture, the, bridge, towns, along, the, loire, jargeau, meung, sur, loire, and, beaugency, this, would, clear, the, way, for, charles, and, his, entourage, who, would, have, to, cross, the, loire, near, orl, ans, to, get, from, chinon, to, reims, the, campaign, to, clear, the, loire, towns, began, on, 11, june, when, the, armagnac, forces, led, by, alen, on, and, joan, arrived, at, jargeau, and, forced, the, english, to, withdraw, inside, the, town, s, walls, joan, sent, a, message, to, the, english, to, surrender, they, refused, and, she, advocated, for, a, direct, assault, on, the, walls, the, next, day, by, the, end, of, the, day, the, town, was, taken, the, armagnac, took, few, prisoners, and, many, of, the, english, who, surrendered, were, killed, during, this, campaign, joan, continued, to, serve, in, the, thick, of, battle, she, began, scaling, a, siege, ladder, with, her, banner, in, hand, but, before, she, could, climb, the, wall, she, was, struck, by, a, stone, which, split, her, helmet, alen, on, and, joan, s, army, advanced, on, meung, sur, loire, on, 15, june, they, took, control, of, the, town, s, bridge, and, the, english, garrison, withdrew, to, a, castle, on, the, loire, s, north, bank, most, of, the, army, continued, on, the, south, bank, of, the, loire, to, besiege, the, castle, at, beaugency, meanwhile, the, english, army, from, paris, under, the, command, of, sir, john, fastolf, had, linked, up, with, the, garrison, in, meung, and, traveled, along, the, north, bank, of, the, loire, to, relieve, beaugency, unaware, of, this, the, english, garrison, at, beaugency, surrendered, on, 18, june, the, main, english, army, retreated, toward, paris, joan, urged, the, armagnacs, to, pursue, them, and, the, two, armies, clashed, at, the, battle, of, patay, later, that, day, the, english, had, prepared, their, forces, to, ambush, an, armagnac, attack, with, hidden, archers, but, the, armagnac, vanguard, detected, and, scattered, them, a, rout, ensued, that, decimated, the, english, army, fastolf, escaped, with, a, small, band, of, soldiers, but, many, of, the, english, leaders, were, captured, joan, arrived, at, the, battlefield, too, late, to, participate, in, the, decisive, action, but, her, encouragement, to, pursue, the, english, had, made, the, victory, possible, after, the, destruction, of, the, english, army, at, patay, some, armagnac, leaders, argued, for, an, invasion, of, english, held, normandy, but, joan, remained, insistent, that, charles, must, be, crowned, the, dauphin, agreed, and, the, army, left, gien, on, 29, june, to, march, on, reims, the, advance, was, nearly, unopposed, the, burgundian, held, town, of, auxerre, surrendered, on, 3, july, after, three, days, of, negotiations, and, other, towns, in, the, army, s, path, returned, to, armagnac, allegiance, without, resistance, troyes, which, had, a, small, garrison, of, english, and, burgundian, troops, was, the, only, one, to, resist, after, four,

of, burgundy, who, promised, he, would, try, to, arrange, the, transfer, of, paris, to, the, armagnacs, while, continuing, negotiations, for, a, definitive, peace, at, the, end, of, the, truce, burgundy, reneged, on, his, promise, joan, and, the, duke, of, alen, on, favored, a, quick, march, on, paris, but, divisions, in, charles, s, court, and, continued, peace, negotiations, with,

and, the, armagnac, army, had, to, retreat, after, the, defeat, at, paris, joan, s, role, in, the, french, court, diminished, her, aggressive, independence, did, not, agree, with, the, court, s, emphasis, on, finding, a, diplomatic, solution, with, burgundy, and, her, role, in, the, defeat, at, paris, reduced, the, court, s, faith, in, her, scholars, at, the, university, of, paris, argued, that, she, failed, to, take, paris, because, her, inspiration, was, not, divine, in, september, charles, disbanded, the, army, and, joan, was, not, allowed, to, work, with, the, duke, of, alen, on, again, in, october, joan, was, sent, as, part, of, a, force, to, attack, the, territory, of, perrinet, gressart, a, mercenary, who, had, served, the, burgundians, and, english, the, army, besieged, saint, pierre, le, mo, tier, which, fell, after, joan, encouraged, a, direct, assault, on, 4, november, the, army, then, tried, unsuccessfully, to, take, la, charit, sur, loire, in, november, and, december, and, had, to, abandon, their, artillery, during, the, retreat, this, defeat, further, diminished, joan, s, reputation, joan, returned, to, court, at, the, end, of, december, where, she, learned, that, she, and, her, family, had, been, ennobled, by, charles, as, a, reward, for, her, services, to, him, and, the, kingdom, before, the, september, attack, on, paris, charles, had, negotiated, a, four, month, truce, with, the, burgundians, which, was, extended, until, easter, 1430, during, this, truce, the, french, court, had, no, need, for, joan, the, duke, of, burgundy, began, to, reclaim, towns, which, had, been, ceded, to, him, by, treaty, but, had, not, submitted, compi, gne, was, one, such, town, of, many, in, areas, which, the, armagnacs, had, recaptured, over, the, previous, few, months, joan, set, out, with, a, company, of, volunteers, at, the, end, of, march, 1430, to, relieve, the, town, which, was, under, siege, this, expedition, did, not, have, the, explicit, permission, of, charles, who, was, still, observing, the, truce, some, writers, suggest, that, joan, s, expedition, to, compi, gne, without, documented, permission, from, the, court, was, a, desperate, and, treasonable, action, but, others, have, argued, that, she, could, not, have, launched, the, expedition, without, the, financial, support, of, the, court, in, april, joan, arrived, at, melun, which, had, expelled, its, burgundian, garrison, as, joan, advanced, her, force, grew, as, other, commanders, joined, her, joan, s, troops, advanced, to, lagny, sur, marne, and, defeated, an, anglo, burgundian, force, commanded, by, the, mercenary, franquet, d, arras, who, was, captured, typically, he, would, have, been, ransomed, or, exchanged, by, the, capturing, force, but, joan, allowed, the, townspeople, to, execute, him, after, a, trial, joan, reached, compi, gne, on, 14, may, after, defensive, forays, against, the, burgundian, besiegers, she, was, forced, to, disband, the, majority, of, the, army, because, it, had, become, too, difficult, for, the, surrounding, countryside, to, support, joan, and, about, 400, of, her, remaining, soldiers, entered, the, town, on, 23, may, 1430, joan, accompanied, an, armagnac, force, which, sortied, from, compi, gne, to, attack, the, burgundian, camp, at, margny, northeast, of, the, town, the, attack, failed, and, joan, was, captured, she, agreed, to, surrender, to, a, pro, burgundian, nobleman, named, lyonnel, de, wandomme, a, member, of, jean, de, luxembourg, s, contingent, who, quickly, moved, her, to, his, castle, at, beaulieu, les, fontaines, near, noyes, after, her, first, attempt, to, escape, she, was, transferred, to, beaurevoir, castle, she, made, another, escape, attempt, while, there, jumping, from, a, window, of, a, tower, and, landing, in, a, dry, moat, she, was, injured, but, survived, in, november, she, was, moved, to, the, burgundian, town, of, arras, the, english, and, burgundians, rejoiced, that, joan, had, been, removed, as, a, military, threat, the, english, negotiated, with, their, burgundian, allies, to, pay, joan, s, ransom, and, transfer, her, to, their, custody, bishop, pierre, cauchon, of, beauvais, a, partisan, supporter, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, and, the, english, crown, played, a, prominent, part, in, these, negotiations, which, were, completed, in, november, the, final, agreement, called, for, the, english, to, pay, 10, 000, livres, tournois, to, obtain, her, from, luxembourg, after, the, english, paid, the, ransom, they, moved, joan, to, rouen, their, main, headquarters, in, france, there, is, no, evidence, that, charles, tried, to, save, joan, once, she, was, transferred, to, the, english, joan, was, put, on, trial, for, heresy, in, rouen, on, 9, january, 1431, she, was, accused, of, having, blasphemed, by, wearing, men, s, clothes, of, acting, upon, visions, that, were, demonic, and, of, refusing, to, submit, her, words, and, deeds, to, the, church, because, she, claimed, she, would, be, judged, by, god, alone, joan, s, captors, downplayed, the, secular, aspects, of, her, trial, by, submitting, her, judgment, to, an, ecclesiastical, court, but, the, trial, was, politically, motivated, joan, testified, that, her, visions, had, instructed, her, to, defeat, the, english, and, crown, charles, and, her, success, was, argued, to, be, evidence, she, was, acting, on, behalf, of, god, if, unchallenged, her, testimony, would, invalidate, the, english, claim, to, the, rule, of, france, and, undermine, the, university, of, paris, which, supported, the, dual, monarchy, ruled, by, an, english, king, the, verdict, was, a, foregone, conclusion, joan, s, guilt, could, be, used, to, compromise, charles, s, claims, to, legitimacy, by, showing, that, he, had, been, consecrated, by, the, act, of, a, heretic, cauchon, served, as, the, ordinary, judge, of, the, trial, the, english, subsidized, the, trial, including, payments, to, cauchon, and, jean, le, ma, tre, who, represented, the, inquisitor, of, france, all, but, 8, of, the, 131, clergy, who, participated, in, the, trial, were, french, and, two, thirds, were, associated, with, the, university, of, paris, but, most, were, pro, burgundian, and, pro, english, cauchon, attempted, to, follow, correct, inquisitorial, procedure, but, the, trial, had, many, irregularities, joan, should, have, been, in, the, hands, of, the, church, during, the, trial, and, guarded, by, women, but, instead, was, imprisoned, by, the, english, and, guarded, by, male, soldiers, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, bedford, contrary, to, canon, law, cauchon, had, not, established, joan, s, infamy, before, proceeding, with, the, trial, joan, was, not, read, the, charges, against, her, until, well, after, her, interrogations, began, the, procedures, were, below, inquisitorial, standards, subjecting, joan, to, lengthy, interrogations, without, legal, counsel, one, of, the, trial, clerics, stepped, down, because, he, felt, the, testimony, was, coerced, and, its, intention, was, to, entrap, joan, another, challenged, cauchon, s, right, to, judge, the, trial, and, was, jailed, there, is, evidence, that, the, trial, records, were, falsified, during, the, trial, joan, showed, great, control, she, induced, her, interrogators, to, ask, questions, sequentially, rather, than, simultaneously, refer, back, to, their, records, when, appropriate, and, end, the, sessions, when, she, requested, witnesses, at, the, trial, were, impressed, by, her, prudence, when, answering, questions, for, example, in, one, exchange, she, was, asked, if, she, knew, she, was, in, god, s, grace, the, question, was, meant, as, a, scholarly, trap, as, church, doctrine, held, that, nobody, could, be, certain, of, being, in, god, s, grace, if, she, answered, positively, she, would, have, been, charged, with, heresy, if, negatively, she, would, have, confessed, her, own, guilt, joan, avoided, the, trap, by, stating, that, if, she, was, not, in, god, s, grace, she, hoped, god, would, put, her, there, and, if, she, was, in, god, s, grace, then, she, hoped, she, would, remain, so, one, of, the, court, notaries, at, her, trial, later, testified, that, the, interrogators, were, stunned, by, her, answer, to, convince, her, to, submit, joan, was, shown, the, instruments, of, torture, when, she, refused, to, be, intimidated, cauchon, met, with, about, a, dozen, assessors, clerical, jurors, to, vote, on, whether, she, should, be, tortured, the, majority, decided, against, it, in, early, may, cauchon, asked, the, university, of, paris, to, deliberate, on, twelve, articles, summarizing, the, accusation, of, heresy, the, university, approved, the, charges, on, 23, may, joan, was, formally, admonished, by, the, court, the, next, day, she, was, taken, out, to, the, churchyard, of, the, abbey, of, saint, ouen, for, public, condemnation, as, cauchon, began, to, read, joan, s, sentence, she, agreed, to, submit, she, was, presented, with, an, abjuration, document, which, included, an, agreement, that, she, would, not, bear, arms, or, wear, men, s, clothing, it, was, read, aloud, to, her, and, she, signed, it, public, heresy, was, a, capital, crime, in, which, an, unrepentant, or, relapsed, heretic, could, be, given, over, to, the, judgment, of, the, secular, courts, and, punished, by, death, having, signed, the, abjuration, joan, was, no, longer, an, unrepentant, heretic, but, could, be, executed, if, convicted, of, relapsing, into, heresy, as, part, of, her, abjuration, joan, was, required, to, renounce, wearing, men, s, clothes, she, exchanged, her, clothes, for, a, woman, s, dress, and, allowed, her, head, to, be, shaved, she, was, returned, to, her, cell, and, kept, in, chains, instead, of, being, transferred, to, an, ecclesiastical, prison, witnesses, at, the, rehabilitation, trial, stated, that, joan, was, subjected, to, mistreatment, and, rape, attempts, including, one, by, an, english, noble, and, that, guards, placed, men, s, clothes, in, her, cell, forcing, her, to, wear, them, cauchon, was, notified, that, joan, had, resumed, wearing, male, clothing, he, sent, clerics, to, admonish, her, to, remain, in, submission, but, the, english, prevented, them, from, visiting, her, on, 28, may, cauchon, went, to, joan, s, cell, along, with, several, other, clerics, according, to, the, trial, record, joan, said, that, she, had, gone, back, to, wearing, men, s, clothes, because, it, was, more, fitting, that, she, dress, like, a, man, while, being, held, with, male, guards, and, that, the, judges, had, broken, their, promise, to, let, her, go, to, mass, and, to, release, her, from, her, chains, she, stated, that, if, they, fulfilled, their, promises, and, placed, her, in, a, decent, prison, she, would, be, obedient, when, cauchon, asked, about, her, visions, joan, stated, that, the, voices, had, blamed, her, for, abjuring, out, of, fear, and, that, she, would, not, deny, them, again, as, joan, s, abjuration, had, required, her, to, deny, her, visions, this, was, sufficient, to, convict, her, of, relapsing, into, heresy, and, to, condemn, her, to, death, the, next, day, forty, two, assessors, were, summoned, to, decide, joan, s, fate, two, recommended, that, she, be, abandoned, to, the, secular, courts, immediately, the, rest, recommended, that, the, abjuration, be, read, to, her, again, and, explained, in, the, end, they, voted, unanimously, that, joan, was, a, relapsed, heretic, and, should, be, abandoned, to, the, secular, power, the, english, for, punishment, at, about, the, age, of, nineteen, joan, was, executed, on, 30, may, 1431, in, the, morning, she, was, allowed, to, receive, the, sacraments, despite, the, court, process, requiring, they, be, denied, to, heretics, she, was, then, taken, to, rouen, s, vieux, march, old, marketplace, where, she, was, publicly, read, her, sentence, of, condemnation, at, this, point, she, should, have, been, turned, over, to, the, appropriate, authority, the, bailiff, of, rouen, for, secular, sentencing, but, instead, was, delivered, directly, to, the, english, and, tied, to, a, tall, plastered, pillar, for, execution, by, burning, she, asked, to, view, a, cross, as, she, died, and, was, given, one, by, an, english, soldier, made, from, a, stick, which, she, kissed, and, placed, next, to, her, chest, a, processional, crucifix, was, fetched, from, the, church, of, saint, saveur, she, embraced, it, before, her, hands, were, bound, and, it, was, held, before, her, eyes, during, her, execution, after, her, death, her, remains, were, thrown, into, the, seine, river, the, military, situation, was, not, changed, by, joan, s, execution, her, triumphs, had, raised, armagnac, morale, and, the, english, were, not, able, to, regain, momentum, charles, remained, king, of, france, despite, a, rival, coronation, held, for, the, ten, year, old, henry, vi, of, england, at, notre, dame, cathedral, in, paris, in, 1431, in, 1435, the, burgundians, signed, the, treaty, of, arras, abandoning, their, alliance, with, england, twenty, two, years, after, joan, s, death, the, war, ended, with, a, french, victory, at, the, battle, of, castillon, in, 1453, and, the, english, were, expelled, from, all, of, france, except, calais, joan, s, execution, created, a, political, liability, for, charles, implying, that, his, consecration, as, the, king, of, france, had, been, achieved, through, the, actions, of, a, heretic, on, 15, february, 1450, a, few, months, after, he, regained, rouen, charles, ordered, guillaume, bouill, a, theologian, and, former, rector, of, the, university, of, paris, to, open, an, inquest, in, a, brief, investigation, bouill, interviewed, seven, witnesses, of, joan, s, trial, and, concluded, that, the, judgment, of, joan, as, a, heretic, was, arbitrary, she, had, been, a, prisoner, of, war, treated, as, a, political, prisoner, and, was, put, to, death, without, basis, bouill, s, report, could, not, overturn, the, verdict, but, it, opened, the, way, for, the, later, retrial, in, 1452, a, second, inquest, into, joan, s, trial, was, opened, by, cardinal, guillaume, d, estouteville, papal, legate, and, relative, of, charles, and, jean, br, hal, the, recently, appointed, inquisitor, of, france, who, interviewed, about, 20, witnesses, the, inquest, was, guided, by, 27, articles, describing, how, joan, s, trial, had, been, biased, immediately, after, the, inquest, d, estouteville, went, to, orl, ans, on, 9, june, and, granted, an, indulgence, to, those, who, participated, in, the, ceremonies, in, joan, s, honor, on, 8, may, commemorating, the, lifting, of, the, siege, for, the, next, two, years, d, estouteville, and, br, hal, worked, on, the, case, br, hal, forwarded, a, petition, from, joan, s, mother, isabelle, and, joan, s, two, brothers, jean, and, pierre, to, pope, nicholas, v, in, 1454, br, hal, submitted, a, summary, of, his, findings, to, theologians, and, lawyers, in, france, and, italy, as, well, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, vienna, most, of, whom, gave, opinions, favorable, to, joan, after, nicholas, v, died, in, early, 1455, the, new, pope, callixtus, iii, gave, permission, for, a, rehabilitation, trial, and, appointed, three, commissioners, to, oversee, the, process, jean, juv, nal, des, ursins, archbishop, of, reims, guillaume, chartier, bishop, of, paris, and, richard, olivier, de, longueil, bishop, of, coutances, they, chose, br, hal, as, inquisitor, the, rehabilitation, trial, began, on, 7, november, 1455, at, notre, dame, cathedral, when, joan, s, mother, publicly, delivered, a, formal, request, for, her, daughter, s, rehabilitation, and, ended, on, 7, july, 1456, at, rouen, cathedral, having, heard, from, about, 115, witnesses, the, court, found, that, the, original, trial, was, unjust, and, deceitful, joan, s, abjuration, execution, and, their, consequences, were, nullified, in, his, summary, of, the, trial, br, hal, suggested, that, cauchon, and, the, assessors, who, supported, him, might, be, guilty, of, malice, and, heresy, to, emphasize, the, court, s, decision, a, copy, of, the, articles, of, accusation, was, formally, torn, up, the, court, ordered, that, a, cross, should, be, erected, on, the, site, of, joan, s, execution, joan, s, visions, played, an, important, role, in, her, condemnation, and, her, admission, that, she, had, returned, to, heeding, them, led, to, her, execution, theologians, of, the, era, believed, that, visions, could, have, a, supernatural, source, the, assessors, at, her, trial, focused, on, determining, the, specific, source, of, joan, s, visions, using, an, ecclesiastical, form, of, discretio, spirituum, discernment, of, spirits, because, she, was, accused, of, heresy, they, sought, to, show, that, her, visions, were, false, the, rehabilitation, trial, nullified, joan, s, sentence, but, did, not, declare, her, visions, authentic, in, 1894, pope, leo, xiii, pronounced, that, joan, s, mission, was, divinely, inspired, modern, scholars, have, discussed, possible, neurological, and, psychiatric, causes, for, her, visions, her, visions, have, been, described, as, hallucinations, arising, from, epilepsy, or, a, temporal, lobe, tuberculoma, others, have, implicated, ergot, poisoning, schizophrenia, delusional, disorder, or, creative, psychopathy, induced, by, her, early, childhood, rearing, one, of, the, promoters, of, the, faith, at, her, 1903, canonization, trial, argued, that, her, visions, may, have, been, manifestations, of, hysteria, other, scholars, argue, that, joan, created, some, of, the, visions, specific, details, in, response, to, the, demands, of, the, interrogators, at, her, trial, many, of, these, explanations, have, been, challenged, the, trial, records, designed, to, demonstrate, that, joan, was, guilty, of, heresy, are, unlikely, to, provide, the, objective, descriptions, of, symptoms, needed, to, support, a, medical, diagnosis, joan, s, firm, belief, in, the, divinity, of, her, visions, strengthened, her, confidence, enabled, her, to, trust, herself, and, gave, her, hope, during, her, capture, and, trial, joan, s, cross, dressing, was, the, topic, of, five, of, the, articles, of, accusation, against, her, during, the, trial, in, the, view, of, the, assessors, it, was, the, emblem, of, her, heresy, her, final, condemnation, began, when, she, was, found, to, have, resumed, wearing, men, s, clothes, which, was, taken, as, a, sign, that, she, had, relapsed, into, heresy, from, the, time, of, her, journey, to, chinon, to, her, abjuration, joan, usually, wore, men, s, clothes, and, cropped, her, hair, in, a, male, fashion, when, she, left, vaucouleurs, to, see, the, dauphin, in, chinon, joan, was, said, to, have, worn, a, black, doublet, a, black, tunic, and, a, short, black, cap, by, the, time, she, was, captured, she, had, acquired, more, elaborate, outfits, at, her, trial, she, was, accused, of, wearing, breeches, a, mantle, a, coat, of, mail, a, doublet, hose, joined, to, the, doublet, with, twenty, laces, tight, boots, spurs, a, breastplate, buskins, a, sword, a, dagger, and, a, lance, she, was, also, described, as, wearing, furs, a, golden, surcoat, over, her, armor, and, sumptuous, riding, habits, made, of, precious, cloth, during, the, trial, proceedings, joan, is, not, recorded, as, giving, a, practical, reason, why, she, cross, dressed, she, stated, that, it, was, her, own, choice, to, wear, men, s, clothes, and, that, she, did, so, not, at, the, request, of, men, but, by, the, command, of, god, and, his, angels, she, stated, she, would, return, to, wearing, women, s, clothes, when, she, fulfilled, her, calling, although, joan, s, cross, dressing, was, used, to, justify, her, execution, the, church, s, position, on, it, was, not, clear, in, general, it, was, seen, as, a, sin, but, there, was, no, agreement, about, its, severity, thomas, aquinas, stated, that, a, woman, may, wear, a, man, s, clothes, to, hide, herself, from, enemies, or, if, no, other, clothes, were, available, and, joan, did, both, wearing, them, in, enemy, territory, to, get, to, chinon, and, in, her, prison, cell, after, her, abjuration, when, her, dress, was, taken, from, her, soon, after, the, siege, of, orl, ans, was, lifted, jean, gerson, said, that, joan, s, male, clothes, and, haircut, were, appropriate, for, her, calling, as, she, was, a, warrior, and, men, s, clothes, were, more, practical, cross, dressing, may, have, helped, her, maintain, her, virginity, by, deterring, rape, witnesses, at, the, nullification, trial, stated, that, joan, gave, this, as, one, of, the, reasons, for, returning, to, men, s, clothes, after, she, had, abjured, wearing, them, however, scholars, have, stated, that, when, she, was, imprisoned, wearing, men, s, clothes, would, only, have, been, a, minor, deterrent, to, rape, as, she, was, shackled, most, of, the, time, for, most, of, her, active, life, joan, did, not, cross, dress, to, hide, her, gender, rather, it, may, have, functioned, to, emphasize, her, unique, identity, as, la, pucelle, a, model, of, virtue, that, transcends, gender, roles, and, inspires, people, joan, is, one, of, the, most, studied, people, of, the, middle, ages, partly, because, her, two, trials, provided, a, wealth, of, documents, her, image, changing, over, time, has, included, being, the, savior, of, france, an, obedient, daughter, of, the, roman, catholic, church, an, early, feminist, and, a, symbol, of, freedom, and, independence, joan, s, reputation, as, a, military, leader, who, helped, drive, the, english, from, france, began, to, form, before, her, death, just, after, charles, s, coronation, christine, de, pizan, wrote, the, poem, diti, de, jehanne, d, arc, celebrating, joan, as, a, supporter, of, charles, sent, by, divine, providence, and, reflecting, french, optimism, after, the, triumph, at, orl, ans, as, early, as, 1429, orl, ans, began, holding, a, celebration, in, honor, of, the, raising, of, the, siege, on, 8, may, after, joan, s, execution, her, role, in, the, orl, ans, victory, encouraged, popular, support, for, her, rehabilitation, joan, became, a, central, part, of, the, annual, celebration, and, by, 1435, a, play, mist, re, du, si, ge, d, orl, ans, mystery, of, the, siege, of, orl, ans, portrayed, her, as, the, vehicle, of, the, divine, will, that, liberated, orl, ans, the, orl, ans, festival, celebrating, joan, continues, in, modern, times, less, than, a, decade, after, her, rehabilitation, trial, pope, pius, ii, wrote, a, brief, biography, describing, her, as, the, maid, who, saved, the, kingdom, of, france, louis, xii, commissioned, a, full, length, biography, of, her, c, 1500, joan, s, early, legacy, was, closely, associated, with, the, divine, right, of, the, monarchy, to, rule, france, during, the, french, revolution, her, reputation, came, into, question, because, of, her, association, with, the, monarchy, and, religion, and, the, festival, in, her, honor, held, at, orl, ans, was, suspended, in, 1793, in, 1803, napoleon, bonaparte, authorized, its, renewal, and, the, creation, of, a, new, statue, of, joan, at, orl, ans, stating, the, illustrious, joan, proved, that, there, is, no, miracle, which, french, genius, cannot, accomplish, when, national, independence, is, threatened, since, then, she, has, become, a, prominent, symbol, as, the, defender, of, the, french, nation, after, the, french, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, joan, became, a, rallying, point, for, a, new, crusade, to, reclaim, lorraine, the, province, of, her, birth, the, third, republic, held, a, patriotic, civic, holiday, in, her, honor, on, 8, may, to, celebrate, her, victory, at, orl, ans, during, world, war, i, her, image, was, used, to, inspire, victory, in, world, war, ii, all, sides, of, the, french, cause, appealed, to, her, legacy, she, was, a, symbol, for, philippe, p, tain, in, vichy, france, a, model, for, charles, de, gaulle, s, leadership, of, the, free, french, and, an, example, for, the, communist, resistance, more, recently, her, association, with, the, monarchy, and, national, liberation, has, made, her, a, symbol, for, the, french, far, right, including, the, monarchist, movement, action, fran, aise, and, the, national, front, party, joan, s, image, has, been, used, by, the, entire, spectrum, of, french, politics, and, she, is, an, important, reference, in, political, dialogue, about, french, identity, and, unity, joan, is, a, saint, in, the, roman, catholic, church, she, was, viewed, as, a, religious, figure, in, orl, ans, after, the, siege, was, lifted, and, an, annual, panegyric, was, pronounced, there, on, her, behalf, until, the, 1800s, in, 1849, the, bishop, of, orl, ans, f, lix,
