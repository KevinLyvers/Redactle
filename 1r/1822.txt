douglas, carl, engelbart, january, 30, 1925, july, 2, 2013, was, an, american, engineer, inventor, and, a, pioneer, in, many, aspects, of, computer, science, he, is, best, known, for, his, work, on, founding, the, field, of, human, computer, interaction, particularly, while, at, his, augmentation, research, center, lab, in, sri, international, which, resulted, in, creation, of, the, computer, mouse, and, the, development, of, hypertext, networked, computers, and, precursors, to, graphical, user, interfaces, these, were, demonstrated, at, the, mother, of, all, demos, in, 1968, engelbart, s, law, the, observation, that, the, intrinsic, rate, of, human, performance, is, exponential, is, named, after, him, nls, the, on, line, system, developed, by, the, augmentation, research, center, under, engelbart, s, guidance, with, funding, primarily, from, arpa, as, darpa, was, then, known, demonstrated, numerous, technologies, most, of, which, are, now, in, widespread, use, it, included, the, computer, mouse, bitmapped, screens, hypertext, all, of, which, were, displayed, at, the, mother, of, all, demos, in, 1968, the, lab, was, transferred, from, sri, to, tymshare, in, the, late, 1970s, which, was, acquired, by, mcdonnell, douglas, in, 1984, and, nls, was, renamed, augment, now, the, doug, engelbart, institute, at, both, tymshare, and, mcdonnell, douglas, engelbart, was, limited, by, a, lack, of, interest, in, his, ideas, and, funding, to, pursue, them, and, retired, in, 1986, in, 1988, engelbart, and, his, daughter, christina, launched, the, bootstrap, institute, later, known, as, the, doug, engelbart, institute, to, promote, his, vision, especially, at, stanford, university, this, effort, did, result, in, some, darpa, funding, to, modernize, the, user, interface, of, augment, in, december, 2000, united, states, president, bill, clinton, awarded, engelbart, the, national, medal, of, technology, the, u, s, s, highest, technology, award, in, december, 2008, engelbart, was, honored, by, sri, at, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, mother, of, all, demos, engelbart, was, born, in, portland, oregon, on, january, 30, 1925, to, carl, louis, engelbart, and, gladys, charlotte, amelia, munson, engelbart, his, ancestors, were, of, german, swedish, and, norwegian, descent, he, was, the, middle, of, three, children, with, a, sister, dorianne, three, years, older, and, a, brother, david, 14, months, younger, the, family, lived, in, portland, oregon, in, his, early, years, and, moved, to, the, surrounding, countryside, along, johnson, creek, when, he, was, 8, his, father, died, one, year, later, he, graduated, from, portland, s, franklin, high, school, in, 1942, midway, through, his, undergraduate, years, at, oregon, state, university, he, served, two, years, in, the, united, states, navy, as, a, radio, and, radar, technician, in, the, philippines, it, was, there, on, the, remote, island, of, leyte, in, a, small, traditional, hut, on, stilts, that, he, read, vannevar, bush, s, article, as, we, may, think, which, would, have, a, large, influence, on, his, thinking, and, work, he, returned, to, oregon, state, and, completed, his, bachelor, s, degree, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1948, while, at, oregon, state, he, was, a, member, of, sigma, phi, epsilon, social, fraternity, he, was, hired, by, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, at, the, ames, research, center, where, he, worked, in, wind, tunnel, maintenance, in, his, off, hours, he, enjoyed, hiking, camping, and, folk, dancing, it, was, there, he, met, ballard, fish, august, 18, 1928, june, 18, 1997, who, was, just, completing, her, training, to, become, an, occupational, therapist, they, were, married, in, portola, state, park, on, may, 5, 1951, soon, after, engelbart, left, ames, to, pursue, graduate, studies, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, at, berkeley, he, studied, electrical, engineering, with, a, specialty, in, computers, earning, his, ms, in, 1953, and, his, phd, in, 1955, engelbart, s, career, was, inspired, in, december, 1950, when, he, was, engaged, to, be, married, and, realized, he, had, no, career, goals, other, than, a, steady, job, getting, married, and, living, happily, ever, after, over, several, months, he, reasoned, that, in, 1945, engelbart, had, read, with, interest, vannevar, bush, s, article, as, we, may, think, a, call, to, action, for, making, knowledge, widely, available, as, a, national, peacetime, grand, challenge, he, had, also, read, something, about, the, recent, phenomenon, of, computers, and, from, his, experience, as, a, radar, technician, he, knew, that, information, could, be, analyzed, and, displayed, on, a, screen, he, envisioned, intellectual, workers, sitting, at, display, working, stations, flying, through, information, space, harnessing, their, collective, intellectual, capacity, to, solve, important, problems, together, in, much, more, powerful, ways, harnessing, collective, intellect, facilitated, by, interactive, computers, became, his, life, s, mission, at, a, time, when, computers, were, viewed, as, number, crunching, tools, as, a, graduate, student, at, berkeley, he, assisted, in, the, construction, of, caldic, his, graduate, work, led, to, eight, patents, after, completing, his, doctorate, engelbart, stayed, on, at, berkeley, as, an, assistant, professor, for, a, year, before, departing, when, it, became, clear, that, he, could, not, pursue, his, vision, there, engelbart, then, formed, a, startup, company, digital, techniques, to, commercialize, some, of, his, doctoral, research, on, storage, devices, but, after, a, year, decided, instead, to, pursue, the, research, he, had, been, dreaming, of, since, 1951, engelbart, took, a, position, at, sri, international, known, then, as, stanford, research, institute, in, menlo, park, california, in, 1957, he, worked, for, hewitt, crane, on, magnetic, devices, and, miniaturization, of, electronics, engelbart, and, crane, became, close, friends, at, sri, engelbart, soon, obtained, a, dozen, patents, and, by, 1962, produced, a, report, about, his, vision, and, proposed, research, agenda, titled, augmenting, human, intellect, a, conceptual, framework, the, research, was, funded, by, the, air, force, office, of, scientific, research, where, rowena, swanson, took, an, active, interest, in, engelbart, s, work, among, other, highlights, this, paper, introduced, building, information, modelling, which, architectural, and, engineering, practice, eventually, adopted, first, as, parametric, design, in, the, 1990s, and, after, this, led, to, funding, from, arpa, to, launch, his, work, engelbart, recruited, a, research, team, in, his, new, augmentation, research, center, arc, the, lab, he, founded, at, sri, engelbart, embedded, a, set, of, organizing, principles, in, his, lab, which, he, termed, bootstrapping, strategy, he, designed, the, strategy, to, accelerate, the, rate, of, innovation, of, his, lab, the, arc, became, the, driving, force, behind, the, design, and, development, of, the, on, line, system, nls, he, and, his, team, developed, computer, interface, elements, such, as, bitmapped, screens, the, mouse, hypertext, collaborative, tools, and, precursors, to, the, graphical, user, interface, he, conceived, and, developed, many, of, his, user, interface, ideas, in, the, mid, 1960s, long, before, the, personal, computer, revolution, at, a, time, when, most, computers, were, inaccessible, to, individuals, who, could, only, use, computers, through, intermediaries, see, batch, processing, and, when, software, tended, to, be, written, for, vertical, applications, in, proprietary, systems, engelbart, applied, for, a, patent, in, 1967, and, received, it, in, 1970, for, the, wooden, shell, with, two, metal, wheels, computer, mouse, u, s, patent, 3, 541, 541, which, he, had, developed, with, bill, english, his, lead, engineer, sometime, before, 1965, in, the, patent, application, it, is, described, as, an, x, y, position, indicator, for, a, display, system, engelbart, later, revealed, that, it, was, nicknamed, the, mouse, because, the, tail, came, out, the, end, his, group, also, called, the, on, screen, cursor, a, bug, but, this, term, was, not, widely, adopted, engelbart, s, original, cursor, was, displayed, as, an, arrow, pointing, upward, but, was, slanted, to, the, left, upon, its, deployment, in, the, xerox, parc, machine, to, better, distinguish, between, on, screen, text, and, the, cursor, in, the, machine, s, low, resolution, interface, the, now, familiar, cursor, arrow, is, characterized, by, a, vertical, left, side, and, a, 45, degree, angle, on, the, right, he, never, received, any, royalties, for, the, invention, of, the, mouse, during, an, interview, he, said, sri, patented, the, mouse, but, they, really, had, no, idea, of, its, value, some, years, later, it, was, learned, that, they, had, licensed, it, to, apple, computer, for, something, like, 40, 000, engelbart, showcased, the, chorded, keyboard, and, many, more, of, his, and, arc, s, inventions, in, 1968, at, the, mother, of, all, demos, engelbart, slipped, into, relative, obscurity, by, the, mid, 1970s, as, early, as, 1970, several, of, his, researchers, became, alienated, from, him, and, left, his, organization, for, xerox, parc, in, part, due, to, frustration, and, in, part, due, to, differing, views, of, the, future, of, computing, engelbart, saw, the, future, in, collaborative, networked, timeshare, client, server, computers, which, younger, programmers, rejected, in, favor, of, personal, computers, the, conflict, was, both, technical, and, ideological, the, younger, programmers, came, from, an, era, where, centralized, power, was, highly, suspect, and, personal, computing, was, just, barely, on, the, horizon, beginning, in, 1972, several, key, arc, personnel, were, involved, in, erhard, seminars, training, est, with, engelbart, ultimately, serving, on, the, corporation, s, board, of, directors, for, many, years, although, est, had, been, recommended, by, other, researchers, the, controversial, nature, of, est, and, other, social, experiments, reduced, the, morale, and, social, cohesion, of, the, arc, community, the, 1969, mansfield, amendment, which, ended, military, funding, of, non, military, research, the, end, of, the, vietnam, war, and, the, end, of, the, apollo, program, gradually, reduced, arc, s, funding, from, arpa, and, nasa, throughout, the, early, 1970s, sri, s, management, which, disapproved, of, engelbart, s, approach, to, running, the, center, placed, the, remains, of, arc, under, the, control, of, artificial, intelligence, researcher, bertram, raphael, who, negotiated, the, transfer, of, the, laboratory, to, tymshare, in, 1976, engelbart, s, house, in, atherton, california, burned, down, during, this, period, causing, him, and, his, family, further, problems, tymshare, took, over, nls, and, the, lab, that, engelbart, had, founded, hired, most, of, the, lab, s, staff, including, its, creator, as, a, senior, scientist, renamed, the, software, augment, and, offered, it, as, a, commercial, service, via, its, new, office, automation, division, tymshare, was, already, somewhat, familiar, with, nls, when, arc, was, still, operational, it, had, experimented, with, its, own, local, copy, of, the, nls, software, on, a, minicomputer, called, office, 1, as, part, of, a, joint, project, with, arc, at, tymshare, engelbart, soon, found, himself, further, marginalized, operational, concerns, at, tymshare, overrode, engelbart, s, desire, to, conduct, ongoing, research, various, executives, first, at, tymshare, and, later, at, mcdonnell, douglas, which, acquired, tymshare, in, 1984, expressed, interest, in, his, ideas, but, never, committed, the, funds, or, the, people, to, further, develop, them, his, interest, inside, of, mcdonnell, douglas, was, focused, on, the, enormous, knowledge, management, and, it, requirements, involved, in, the, life, cycle, of, an, aerospace, program, which, served, to, strengthen, engelbart, s, resolve, to, motivate, the, information, technology, arena, toward, global, interoperability, and, an, open, hyperdocument, system, engelbart, retired, from, mcdonnell, douglas, in, 1986, determined, to, pursue, his, work, free, from, commercial, pressure, teaming, with, his, daughter, christina, engelbart, he, founded, the, bootstrap, institute, in, 1988, to, coalesce, his, ideas, into, a, series, of, three, day, and, half, day, management, seminars, offered, at, stanford, university, from, 1989, to, 2000, by, the, early, 1990s, there, was, sufficient, interest, among, his, seminar, graduates, to, launch, a, collaborative, implementation, of, his, work, and, the, bootstrap, alliance, was, formed, as, a, non, profit, home, base, for, this, effort, although, the, invasion, of, iraq, and, subsequent, recession, spawned, a, rash, of, belt, tightening, reorganizations, which, drastically, redirected, the, efforts, of, their, alliance, partners, they, continued, with, the, management, seminars, consulting, and, small, scale, collaborations, in, the, mid, 1990s, they, were, awarded, some, darpa, funding, to, develop, a, modern, user, interface, to, augment, called, visual, augterm, vat, while, participating, in, a, larger, program, addressing, the, it, requirements, of, the, joint, task, force, engelbart, was, founder, emeritus, of, the, doug, engelbart, institute, which, he, founded, in, 1988, with, his, daughter, christina, engelbart, who, is, executive, director, the, institute, promotes, engelbart, s, philosophy, for, boosting, collective, iq, the, concept, of, dramatically, improving, how, we, can, solve, important, problems, together, using, a, strategic, bootstrapping, approach, for, accelerating, our, progress, toward, that, goal, in, 2005, engelbart, received, a, national, science, foundation, grant, to, fund, the, open, source, hyperscope, project, the, hyperscope, team, built, a, browser, component, using, ajax, and, dynamic, html, designed, to, replicate, augment, s, multiple, viewing, and, jumping, capabilities, linking, within, and, across, various, documents, engelbart, attended, the, program, for, the, future, 2010, conference, where, hundreds, of, people, convened, at, the, tech, museum, in, san, jose, and, online, to, engage, in, dialog, about, how, to, pursue, his, vision, to, augment, collective, intelligence, the, most, complete, coverage, of, engelbart, s, bootstrapping, ideas, can, be, found, in, boosting, our, collective, iq, by, douglas, c, engelbart, 1995, this, includes, three, of, engelbart, s, key, papers, edited, into, book, form, by, yuri, rubinsky, and, christina, engelbart, to, commemorate, the, presentation, of, the, 1995, softquad, web, award, to, doug, engelbart, at, the, world, wide, web, conference, in, boston, in, december, 1995, only, 2, 000, softcover, copies, were, printed, and, 100, hardcover, numbered, and, signed, by, engelbart, and, tim, berners, lee, engelbart, s, book, is, now, being, republished, by, the, doug, engelbart, institute, two, comprehensive, histories, of, engelbart, s, laboratory, and, work, are, in, what, the, dormouse, said, how, the, sixties, counterculture, shaped, the, personal, computer, industry, by, john, markoff, and, a, heritage, of, innovation, sri, s, first, half, century, by, donald, neilson, other, books, on, engelbart, and, his, laboratory, include, bootstrapping, douglas, engelbart, coevolution, and, the, origins, of, personal, computing, by, thierry, bardini, and, the, engelbart, hypothesis, dialogs, with, douglas, engelbart, by, valerie, landau, and, eileen, clegg, in, conversation, with, douglas, engelbart, all, four, of, these, books, are, based, on, interviews, with, engelbart, as, well, as, other, contributors, in, his, laboratory, engelbart, served, on, the, advisory, boards, of, the, university, of, santa, clara, center, for, science, technology, and, society, foresight, institute, computer, professionals, for, social, responsibility, the, technology, center, of, silicon, valley, and, the, liquid, information, company, engelbart, had, four, children, gerda, diana, christina, and, norman, with, his, first, wife, ballard, who, died, in, 1997, after, 47, years, of, marriage, he, remarried, on, january, 26, 2008, to, writer, and, producer, karen, o, leary, engelbart, an, 85th, birthday, celebration, was, held, at, the, tech, museum, of, innovation, engelbart, died, at, his, home, in, atherton, california, on, july, 2, 2013, due, to, kidney, failure, a, close, friend, and, fellow, computer, scientist, ted, nelson, gave, a, speech, paying, tribute, to, engelbart, according, to, the, doug, engelbart, institute, his, death, came, after, a, long, battle, with, alzheimer, s, disease, which, he, was, diagnosed, with, in, 2007, engelbart, was, 88, and, was, survived, by, his, second, wife, the, four, children, from, his, first, marriage, and, nine, grandchildren, historian, of, science, thierry, bardini, argues, that, engelbart, s, complex, personal, philosophy, which, drove, all, his, research, foreshadowed, the, modern, application, of, the, concept, of, coevolution, to, the, philosophy, and, use, of, technology, bardini, points, out, that, engelbart, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, principle, of, linguistic, relativity, developed, by, benjamin, lee, whorf, where, whorf, reasoned, that, the, sophistication, of, a, language, controls, the, sophistication, of, the, thoughts, that, can, be, expressed, by, a, speaker, of, that, language, engelbart, reasoned, that, the, state, of, our, current, technology, controls, our, ability, to, manipulate, information, and, that, fact, in, turn, will, control, our, ability, to, develop, new, improved, technologies, he, thus, set, himself, to, the, revolutionary, task, of, developing, computer, based, technologies, for, manipulating, information, directly, and, also, to, improve, individual, and, group, processes, for, knowledge, work, since, the, late, 1980s, prominent, individuals, and, organizations, have, recognized, the, seminal, importance, of, engelbart, s, contributions, in, december, 1995, at, the, fourth, www, conference, in, boston, he, was, the, first, recipient, of, what, would, later, become, the, yuri, rubinsky, memorial, award, in, 1997, he, was, awarded, the, lemelson, mit, prize, of, 500, 000, the, world, s, largest, single, prize, for, invention, and, innovation, and, the, acm, turing, award, to, mark, the, 30th, anniversary, of, engelbart, s, 1968, demo, in, 1998, the, stanford, silicon, valley, archives, and, the, institute, for, the, future, hosted, engelbart, s, unfinished, revolution, a, symposium, at, stanford, university, s, memorial, auditorium, to, honor, engelbart, and, his, ideas, he, was, inducted, into, national, inventors, hall, of, fame, in, 1998, engelbart, was, awarded, the, stibitz, wilson, award, from, the, american, computer, robotics, museum, in, 1998, also, in, 1998, association, for, computing, machinery, acm, sigchi, awarded, engelbart, the, chi, lifetime, achievement, award, acm, sigchi, later, inducted, engelbart, into, the, chi, academy, in, 2002, engelbart, was, awarded, the, franklin, institute, s, certificate, of, merit, in, 1996, and, the, benjamin, franklin, medal, in, 1999, in, computer, and, cognitive, science, in, early, 2000, engelbart, produced, with, volunteers, and, sponsors, what, was, called, the, unfinished, revolution, ii, also, known, as, the, engelbart, colloquium, at, stanford, university, to, document, and, publicize, his, work, and, ideas, to, a, larger, audience, live, and, online, in, december, 2000, u, s, president, bill, clinton, awarded,
