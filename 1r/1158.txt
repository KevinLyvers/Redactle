was, the, youngest, son, of, king, thelwulf, and, his, first, wife, osburh, who, both, died, when, alfred, was, young, three, of, alfred, s, brothers, thelbald, thelberht, and, thelred, reigned, in, turn, before, him, under, alfred, s, rule, considerable, administrative, and, military, reforms, were, introduced, prompting, lasting, change, in, england, after, ascending, the, throne, alfred, spent, several, years, fighting, viking, invasions, he, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, battle, of, edington, in, 878, and, made, an, agreement, with, the, vikings, dividing, england, between, anglo, saxon, territory, and, the, viking, ruled, danelaw, composed, of, scandinavian, york, the, north, east, midlands, and, east, anglia, alfred, also, oversaw, the, conversion, of, viking, leader, guthrum, to, christianity, he, defended, his, kingdom, against, the, viking, attempt, at, conquest, becoming, the, dominant, ruler, in, england, alfred, began, styling, himself, as, king, of, the, anglo, saxons, after, reoccupying, london, from, the, vikings, details, of, his, life, are, described, in, a, work, by, 9th, century, welsh, scholar, and, bishop, asser, alfred, had, a, reputation, as, a, learned, and, merciful, man, of, a, gracious, and, level, headed, nature, who, encouraged, education, proposing, that, primary, education, be, conducted, in, english, rather, than, latin, and, improving, the, legal, system, and, military, structure, and, his, people, s, quality, of, life, he, was, given, the, epithet, the, great, from, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, though, it, was, only, popularised, from, the, 16th, century, alfred, is, the, only, native, born, english, monarch, to, be, labelled, as, such, alfred, was, a, son, of, thelwulf, king, of, wessex, and, his, wife, osburh, according, to, his, biographer, asser, writing, in, 893, in, the, year, of, our, lord, s, incarnation, 849, alfred, king, of, the, anglo, saxons, was, born, at, the, royal, estate, called, wantage, in, the, district, known, as, berkshire, which, is, so, called, from, berroc, wood, where, the, box, tree, grows, very, abundantly, this, date, has, been, accepted, by, the, editors, of, asser, s, biography, simon, keynes, and, michael, lapidge, and, by, other, historians, such, as, david, dumville, justin, pollard, and, richard, huscroft, west, saxon, genealogical, lists, state, that, alfred, was, 23, when, he, became, king, in, april, 871, implying, that, he, was, born, between, april, 847, and, april, 848, this, dating, is, adopted, in, the, biography, of, alfred, by, alfred, smyth, who, regards, asser, s, biography, as, fraudulent, an, allegation, which, is, rejected, by, other, historians, richard, abels, in, his, biography, discusses, both, sources, but, does, not, decide, between, them, and, dates, alfred, s, birth, as, 847, 849, while, patrick, wormald, in, his, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, article, dates, it, 848, 849, berkshire, had, been, historically, disputed, between, wessex, and, the, midland, kingdom, of, mercia, and, as, late, as, 844, a, charter, showed, that, it, was, part, of, mercia, but, alfred, s, birth, in, the, county, is, evidence, that, by, the, late, 840s, control, had, passed, to, wessex, he, was, the, youngest, of, six, children, his, eldest, brother, thelstan, was, old, enough, to, be, appointed, sub, king, of, kent, in, 839, almost, 10, years, before, alfred, was, born, he, died, in, the, early, 850s, alfred, s, next, three, brothers, were, successively, kings, of, wessex, thelbald, 858, 860, and, thelberht, 860, 865, were, also, much, older, than, alfred, but, thelred, 865, 871, was, only, a, year, or, two, older, alfred, s, only, known, sister, thelswith, married, burgred, king, of, mercia, in, 853, most, historians, think, that, osburh, was, the, mother, of, all, thelwulf, s, children, but, some, suggest, that, the, older, ones, were, born, to, an, unrecorded, first, wife, osburh, was, descended, from, the, rulers, of, the, isle, of, wight, she, was, described, by, alfred, s, biographer, asser, as, a, most, religious, woman, noble, by, temperament, and, noble, by, birth, she, had, died, by, 856, when, thelwulf, married, judith, daughter, of, charles, the, bald, king, of, west, francia, in, 868, alfred, married, ealhswith, daughter, of, the, mercian, nobleman, thelred, mucel, ealdorman, of, the, gaini, and, his, wife, eadburh, who, was, of, royal, mercian, descent, their, children, were, thelfl, d, who, married, thelred, lord, of, the, mercians, edward, the, elder, alfred, s, successor, as, king, thelgifu, abbess, of, shaftesbury, lfthryth, who, married, baldwin, count, of, flanders, and, thelweard, alfred, s, grandfather, ecgberht, became, king, of, wessex, in, 802, and, in, the, view, of, the, historian, richard, abels, it, must, have, seemed, very, unlikely, to, contemporaries, that, he, would, establish, a, lasting, dynasty, for, 200, years, three, families, had, fought, for, the, west, saxon, throne, and, no, son, had, followed, his, father, as, king, no, ancestor, of, ecgberht, had, been, a, king, of, wessex, since, ceawlin, in, the, late, sixth, century, but, he, was, believed, to, be, a, paternal, descendant, of, cerdic, the, founder, of, the, west, saxon, dynasty, this, made, ecgberht, an, theling, a, prince, eligible, for, the, throne, but, after, ecgberht, s, reign, descent, from, cerdic, was, no, longer, sufficient, to, make, a, man, an, theling, when, ecgberht, died, in, 839, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, thelwulf, all, subsequent, west, saxon, kings, were, descendants, of, ecgberht, and, thelwulf, and, were, also, sons, of, kings, at, the, beginning, of, the, ninth, century, england, was, almost, wholly, under, the, control, of, the, anglo, saxons, mercia, dominated, southern, england, but, its, supremacy, came, to, an, end, in, 825, when, it, was, decisively, defeated, by, ecgberht, at, the, battle, of, ellendun, mercia, and, wessex, became, allies, which, was, important, in, the, resistance, to, viking, attacks, in, 853, king, burgred, of, mercia, requested, west, saxon, help, to, suppress, a, welsh, rebellion, and, thelwulf, led, a, west, saxon, contingent, in, a, successful, joint, campaign, in, the, same, year, burgred, married, thelwulf, s, daughter, thelswith, in, 825, ecgberht, sent, thelwulf, to, invade, the, mercian, sub, kingdom, of, kent, and, its, sub, king, baldred, was, driven, out, shortly, afterwards, by, 830, essex, surrey, and, sussex, had, submitted, to, ecgberht, and, he, had, appointed, thelwulf, to, rule, the, south, eastern, territories, as, king, of, kent, the, vikings, ravaged, the, isle, of, sheppey, in, 835, and, the, following, year, they, defeated, ecgberht, at, carhampton, in, somerset, but, in, 838, he, was, victorious, over, an, alliance, of, cornishmen, and, vikings, at, the, battle, of, hingston, down, reducing, cornwall, to, the, status, of, a, client, kingdom, when, thelwulf, succeeded, to, the, throne, he, appointed, his, eldest, son, thelstan, as, sub, king, of, kent, ecgberht, and, thelwulf, may, not, have, intended, a, permanent, union, between, wessex, and, kent, because, they, both, appointed, sons, as, sub, kings, and, charters, in, wessex, were, attested, witnessed, by, west, saxon, magnates, while, kentish, charters, were, witnessed, by, the, kentish, elite, both, kings, kept, overall, control, and, the, sub, kings, were, not, allowed, to, issue, their, own, coinage, viking, raids, increased, in, the, early, 840s, on, both, sides, of, the, english, channel, and, in, 843, thelwulf, was, defeated, at, carhampton, in, 850, thelstan, defeated, a, danish, fleet, off, sandwich, in, the, first, recorded, naval, battle, in, english, history, in, 851, thelwulf, and, his, second, son, thelbald, defeated, the, vikings, at, the, battle, of, aclea, and, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, there, made, the, greatest, slaughter, of, a, heathen, raiding, army, that, we, have, heard, tell, of, up, to, this, present, day, and, there, took, the, victory, thelwulf, died, in, 858, and, was, succeeded, by, his, oldest, surviving, son, thelbald, as, king, of, wessex, and, by, his, next, oldest, son, thelberht, as, king, of, kent, thelbald, only, survived, his, father, by, two, years, and, thelberht, then, for, the, first, time, united, wessex, and, kent, into, a, single, kingdom, according, to, asser, in, his, childhood, alfred, won, a, beautifully, decorated, book, of, english, poetry, offered, as, a, prize, by, his, mother, to, the, first, of, her, sons, able, to, memorise, it, he, must, have, had, it, read, to, him, because, his, mother, died, when, he, was, about, six, and, he, did, not, learn, to, read, until, he, was, 12, in, 853, alfred, is, reported, by, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, to, have, been, sent, to, rome, where, he, was, confirmed, by, pope, leo, iv, who, anointed, him, as, king, victorian, writers, later, interpreted, this, as, an, anticipatory, coronation, in, preparation, for, his, eventual, succession, to, the, throne, of, wessex, this, is, unlikely, his, succession, could, not, have, been, foreseen, at, the, time, because, alfred, had, three, living, elder, brothers, a, letter, of, leo, iv, shows, that, alfred, was, made, a, consul, and, a, misinterpretation, of, this, investiture, deliberate, or, accidental, could, explain, later, confusion, it, may, be, based, upon, the, fact, that, alfred, later, accompanied, his, father, on, a, pilgrimage, to, rome, where, he, spent, some, time, at, the, court, of, charles, the, bald, king, of, the, franks, around, 854, 855, on, their, return, from, rome, in, 856, thelwulf, was, deposed, by, his, son, thelbald, with, civil, war, looming, the, magnates, of, the, realm, met, in, council, to, form, a, compromise, thelbald, retained, the, western, shires, i, e, historical, wessex, and, thelwulf, ruled, in, the, east, after, king, thelwulf, died, in, 858, wessex, was, ruled, by, three, of, alfred, s, brothers, in, succession, thelbald, thelberht, and, thelred, alfred, is, not, mentioned, during, the, short, reigns, of, his, older, brothers, thelbald, and, thelberht, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, describes, the, great, heathen, army, of, danes, landing, in, east, anglia, with, the, intent, of, conquering, the, four, kingdoms, which, constituted, anglo, saxon, england, in, 865, alfred, s, public, life, began, in, 865, at, age, 16, with, the, accession, of, his, third, brother, 18, year, old, thelred, during, this, period, bishop, asser, gave, alfred, the, unique, title, of, secundarius, which, may, indicate, a, position, similar, to, the, celtic, tanist, a, recognised, successor, closely, associated, with, the, reigning, monarch, this, arrangement, may, have, been, sanctioned, by, alfred, s, father, or, by, the, witan, to, guard, against, the, danger, of, a, disputed, succession, should, thelred, fall, in, battle, it, was, a, well, known, tradition, among, other, germanic, peoples, such, as, the, swedes, and, franks, to, whom, the, anglo, saxons, were, closely, related, to, crown, a, successor, as, royal, prince, and, military, commander, in, 868, alfred, was, recorded, as, fighting, beside, thelred, in, a, failed, attempt, to, keep, the, great, heathen, army, led, by, ivar, the, boneless, out, of, the, adjoining, kingdom, of, mercia, the, danes, arrived, in, his, homeland, at, the, end, of, 870, and, nine, engagements, were, fought, in, the, following, year, with, mixed, results, the, places, and, dates, of, two, of, these, battles, have, not, been, recorded, a, successful, skirmish, at, the, battle, of, englefield, in, berkshire, on, 31, december, 870, was, followed, by, a, severe, defeat, at, the, siege, and, the, battle, of, reading, by, ivar, s, brother, halfdan, ragnarsson, on, 5, january, 871, four, days, later, the, anglo, saxons, won, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, ashdown, on, the, berkshire, downs, possibly, near, compton, or, aldworth, the, saxons, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, basing, on, 22, january, they, were, defeated, again, on, 22, march, at, the, battle, of, merton, perhaps, marden, in, wiltshire, or, martin, in, dorset, thelred, died, shortly, afterwards, in, april, 871, in, april, 871, king, thelred, died, and, alfred, acceded, to, the, throne, of, wessex, and, the, burden, of, its, defence, even, though, thelred, left, two, under, age, sons, thelhelm, and, thelwold, this, was, in, accordance, with, the, agreement, that, thelred, and, alfred, had, made, earlier, that, year, in, an, assembly, at, an, unidentified, place, called, swinbeorg, the, brothers, had, agreed, that, whichever, of, them, outlived, the, other, would, inherit, the, personal, property, that, king, thelwulf, had, left, jointly, to, his, sons, in, his, will, the, deceased, s, sons, would, receive, only, whatever, property, and, riches, their, father, had, settled, upon, them, and, whatever, additional, lands, their, uncle, had, acquired, the, unstated, premise, was, that, the, surviving, brother, would, be, king, given, the, danish, invasion, and, the, youth, of, his, nephews, alfred, s, accession, probably, went, uncontested, while, he, was, busy, with, the, burial, ceremonies, for, his, brother, the, danes, defeated, the, saxon, army, in, his, absence, at, an, unnamed, spot, and, then, again, in, his, presence, at, wilton, in, may, the, defeat, at, wilton, smashed, any, remaining, hope, that, alfred, could, drive, the, invaders, from, his, kingdom, alfred, was, forced, instead, to, make, peace, with, them, although, the, terms, of, the, peace, are, not, recorded, bishop, asser, wrote, that, the, pagans, agreed, to, vacate, the, realm, and, made, good, their, promise, the, viking, army, withdrew, from, reading, in, the, autumn, of, 871, to, take, up, winter, quarters, in, mercian, london, although, not, mentioned, by, asser, or, by, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, alfred, probably, paid, the, vikings, silver, to, leave, much, as, the, mercians, were, to, do, in, the, following, year, hoards, dating, to, the, viking, occupation, of, london, in, 871, 872, have, been, excavated, at, croydon, gravesend, and, waterloo, bridge, these, finds, hint, at, the, cost, involved, in, making, peace, with, the, vikings, for, the, next, five, years, the, danes, occupied, other, parts, of, england, in, 876, under, guthrum, oscetel, and, anwend, the, danes, slipped, past, the, saxon, army, and, attacked, and, occupied, wareham, in, dorset, alfred, blockaded, them, but, was, unable, to, take, wareham, by, assault, he, negotiated, a, peace, that, involved, an, exchange, of, hostages, and, oaths, which, the, danes, swore, on, a, holy, ring, associated, with, the, worship, of, thor, the, danes, broke, their, word, and, after, killing, all, the, hostages, slipped, away, under, cover, of, night, to, exeter, in, devon, alfred, blockaded, the, viking, ships, in, devon, and, with, a, relief, fleet, having, been, scattered, by, a, storm, the, danes, were, forced, to, submit, the, danes, withdrew, to, mercia, in, january, 878, the, danes, made, a, sudden, attack, on, chippenham, a, royal, stronghold, in, which, alfred, had, been, staying, over, christmas, and, most, of, the, people, they, killed, except, the, king, alfred, and, he, with, a, little, band, made, his, way, by, wood, and, swamp, and, after, easter, he, made, a, fort, at, athelney, in, the, marshes, of, somerset, and, from, that, fort, kept, fighting, against, the, foe, considering, the, fate, of, the, mercians, kingdom, under, similar, viking, pressure, and, an, analysis, of, charter, signatories, either, side, of, the, raid, it, has, been, suggested, that, alfred, may, have, fallen, prey, to, a, witan, coup, at, chippenham, rather, than, simply, being, surprised, by, a, viking, attack, from, his, fort, at, athelney, an, island, in, the, marshes, near, north, petherton, alfred, was, able, to, mount, a, resistance, campaign, rallying, the, local, militias, from, somerset, wiltshire, and, hampshire, 878, was, the, nadir, of, the, history, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, with, all, the, other, kingdoms, having, fallen, to, the, vikings, wessex, alone, was, resisting, having, fled, to, the, somerset, levels, alfred, was, purportedly, given, shelter, by, a, peasant, woman, who, unaware, of, his, identity, asked, him, to, mind, some, wheaten, cakes, she, left, baking, by, the, fire, preoccupied, with, the, problems, of, his, kingdom, alfred, accidentally, let, the, cakes, burn, and, was, roundly, scolded, by, the, woman, upon, her, return, the, first, written, account, of, the, legend, appears, a, century, after, alfred, s, death, though, it, may, have, earlier, origins, in, folklore, in, the, seventh, week, after, easter, 4, 10, may, 878, around, whitsuntide, alfred, rode, to, egbert, s, stone, east, of, selwood, where, he, was, met, by, all, the, people, of, somerset, and, of, wiltshire, and, of, that, part, of, hampshire, which, is, on, this, side, of, the, sea, that, is, west, of, southampton, water, and, they, rejoiced, to, see, him, alfred, s, emergence, from, his, marshland, stronghold, was, part, of, a, carefully, planned, offensive, that, entailed, raising, the, fyrds, of, three, shires, this, meant, not, only, that, the, king, had, retained, the, loyalty, of, ealdormen, royal, reeves, and, king, s, thegns, who, were, charged, with, levying, and, leading, these, forces, but, that, they, had, maintained, their, positions, of, authority, in, these, localities, well, enough, to, answer, his, summons, to, war, alfred, s, actions, also, suggest, a, system, of, scouts, and, messengers, alfred, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, edington, which, may, have, been, fought, near, westbury, wiltshire, he, then, pursued, the, danes, to, their, stronghold, at, chippenham, and, starved, them, into, submission, one, of, the, terms, of, the, surrender, was, that, guthrum, convert, to, christianity, three, weeks, later, the, danish, king, and, 29, of, his, chief, men, were, baptised, at, alfred, s, court, at, aller, near, athelney, with, alfred, receiving, guthrum, as, his, spiritual, son, according, to, asser, the, unbinding, of, the, chrisom, on, the, eighth, day, took, place, at, a, royal, estate, called, wedmore, at, wedmore, alfred, and, guthrum, negotiated, what, some, historians, have, called, the, treaty, of, wedmore, but, it, was, to, be, some, years, after, the, cessation, of, hostilities, that, a, formal, treaty, was, signed, under, the, terms, of, the, so, called, treaty, of, wedmore, the, converted, guthrum, was, required, to, leave, wessex, and, return, to, east, anglia, consequently, in, 879, the, viking, army, left, chippenham, and, made, its, way, to, cirencester, the, formal, treaty, of, alfred, and, guthrum, preserved, in, old, english, in, corpus, christi, college, cambridge, manuscript, 383, and, in, a, latin, compilation, known, as, quadripartitus, was, negotiated, later, perhaps, in, 879, or, 880, when, king, ceolwulf, ii, of, mercia, was, deposed, that, treaty, divided, up, the, kingdom, of, mercia, by, its, terms, the, boundary, between, alfred, s, and, guthrum, s, kingdoms, was, to, run, up, the, river, thames, to, the, river, lea, follow, the, lea, to, its, source, near, luton, from, there, extend, in, a, straight, line, to, bedford, and, from, bedford, follow, the, river, ouse, to, watling, street, alfred, succeeded, to, ceolwulf, s, kingdom, consisting, of, western, mercia, and, guthrum, incorporated, the, eastern, part, of, mercia, into, an, enlarged, kingdom, of, east, anglia, henceforward, known, as, the, danelaw, by, terms, of, the, treaty, moreover, alfred, was, to, have, control, over, the, mercian, city, of, london, and, its, mints, at, least, for, the, time, being, in, 825, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, had, recorded, that, the, people, of, essex, sussex, kent, and, surrey, surrendered, to, egbert, alfred, s, grandfather, from, then, until, the, arrival, of, the, great, heathen, army, essex, had, formed, part, of, wessex, after, the, foundation, of, danelaw, it, appears, that, some, of, essex, would, have, been, ceded, to, the, danes, but, how, much, is, not, clear, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, alfred, and, guthrum, an, event, most, commonly, held, to, have, taken, place, around, 880, when, guthrum, s, people, began, settling, east, anglia, guthrum, was, neutralised, as, a, threat, the, viking, army, which, had, stayed, at, fulham, during, the, winter, of, 878, 879, sailed, for, ghent, and, was, active, on, the, continent, from, 879, to, 892, there, were, local, raids, on, the, coast, of, wessex, throughout, the, 880s, in, 882, alfred, fought, a, small, sea, battle, against, four, danish, ships, two, of, the, ships, were, destroyed, and, the, others, surrendered, this, was, one, of, four, sea, battles, recorded, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, three, of, which, involved, alfred, similar, small, skirmishes, with, independent, viking, raiders, would, have, occurred, for, much, of, the, period, as, they, had, for, decades, in, 883, pope, marinus, exempted, the, saxon, quarter, in, rome, from, taxation, probably, in, return, for, alfred, s, promise, to, send, alms, annually, to, rome, which, may, be, the, origin, of, the, medieval, tax, called, peter, s, pence, the, pope, sent, gifts, to, alfred, including, what, was, reputed, to, be, a, piece, of, the, true, cross, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, with, guthrum, alfred, was, spared, any, large, scale, conflicts, for, some, time, despite, this, relative, peace, the, king, was, forced, to, deal, with, a, number, of, danish, raids, and, incursions, among, these, was, a, raid, in, kent, an, allied, kingdom, in, south, east, england, during, the, year, 885, which, was, possibly, the, largest, raid, since, the, battles, with, guthrum, asser, s, account, of, the, raid, places, the, danish, raiders, at, the, saxon, city, of, rochester, where, they, built, a, temporary, fortress, in, order, to, besiege, the, city, in, response, to, this, incursion, alfred, led, an, anglo, saxon, force, against, the, danes, who, instead, of, engaging, the, army, of, wessex, fled, to, their, beached, ships, and, sailed, to, another, part, of, britain, the, retreating, danish, force, supposedly, left, britain, the, following, summer, not, long, after, the, failed, danish, raid, in, kent, alfred, dispatched, his, fleet, to, east, anglia, the, purpose, of, this, expedition, is, debated, but, asser, claims, that, it, was, for, the, sake, of, plunder, after, travelling, up, the, river, stour, the, fleet, was, met, by, danish, vessels, that, numbered, 13, or, 16, sources, vary, on, the, number, and, a, battle, ensued, the, anglo, saxon, fleet, emerged, victorious, and, as, henry, of, huntingdon, writes, laden, with, spoils, the, victorious, fleet, was, surprised, when, attempting, to, leave, the, river, stour, and, was, attacked, by, a, danish, force, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, the, danish, fleet, defeated, alfred, s, fleet, which, may, have, been, weakened, in, the, previous, engagement, a, year, later, in, 886, alfred, reoccupied, the, city, of, london, and, set, out, to, make, it, habitable, again, alfred, entrusted, the, city, to, the, care, of, his, son, in, law, thelred, ealdorman, of, mercia, soon, afterwards, alfred, restyled, himself, as, king, of, the, anglo, saxons, the, restoration, of, london, progressed, through, the, latter, half, of, the, 880s, and, is, believed, to, have, revolved, around, a, new, street, plan, added, fortifications, in, addition, to, the, existing, roman, walls, and, some, believe, the, construction, of, matching, fortifications, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, thames, this, is, also, the, period, in, which, almost, all, chroniclers, agree, that, the, saxon, people, of, pre, unification, england, submitted, to, alfred, in, 888, thelred, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, also, died, one, year, later, guthrum, or, athelstan, by, his, baptismal, name, alfred, s, former, enemy, and, king, of, east, anglia, died, and, was, buried, in, hadleigh, suffolk, guthrum, s, death, changed, the, political, landscape, for, alfred, the, resulting, power, vacuum, stirred, other, power, hungry, warlords, eager, to, take, his, place, in, the, following, years, after, another, lull, in, the, autumn, of, 892, or, 893, the, danes, attacked, again, finding, their, position, in, mainland, europe, precarious, they, crossed, to, england, in, 330, ships, in, two, divisions, they, entrenched, themselves, the, larger, body, at, appledore, kent, and, the, lesser, under, hastein, at, milton, also, in, kent, the, invaders, brought, their, wives, and, children, with, them, indicating, a, meaningful, attempt, at, conquest, and, colonisation, alfred, in, 893, or, 894, took, up, a, position, from, which, he, could, observe, both, forces, while, he, was, in, talks, with, hastein, the, danes, at, appledore, broke, out, and, struck, north, westwards, they, were, overtaken, by, alfred, s, eldest, son, edward, and, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, farnham, in, surrey, they, took, refuge, on, an, island, at, thorney, on, the, river, colne, between, buckinghamshire, and, middlesex, where, they, were, blockaded, and, forced, to, give, hostages, and, promise, to, leave, wessex, they, then, went, to, essex, and, after, suffering, another, defeat, at, benfleet, joined, with, hastein, s, force, at, shoebury, alfred, had, been, on, his, way, to, relieve, his, son, at, thorney, when, he, heard, that, the, northumbrian, and, east, anglian, danes, were, besieging, exeter, and, an, unnamed, stronghold, on, the, north, devon, shore, alfred, at, once, hurried, westward, and, raised, the, siege, of, exeter, the, fate, of, the, other, place, is, not, recorded, the, force, under, hastein, set, out, to, march, up, the, thames, valley, possibly, with, the, idea, of, assisting, their, friends, in, the, west, they, were, met, by, a, large, force, under, the, three, great, ealdormen, of, mercia, wiltshire, and, somerset, and, forced, to, head, off, to, the, north, west, being, finally, overtaken, and, blockaded, at, buttington, some, identify, this, with, buttington, tump, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, wye, others, with, buttington, near, welshpool, an, attempt, to, break, through, the, english, lines, failed, those, who, escaped, retreated, to, shoebury, after, collecting, reinforcements, they, made, a, sudden, dash, across, england, and, occupied, the, ruined, roman, walls, of, chester, the, english, did, not, attempt, a, winter, blockade, but, contented, themselves, with, destroying, all, the, supplies, in, the, district, early, in, 894, or, 895, lack, of, food, obliged, the, danes, to, retire, once, more, to, essex, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, danes, drew, their, ships, up, the, river, thames, and, the, river, lea, and, fortified, themselves, twenty, miles, 32, km, north, of, london, a, frontal, attack, on, the, danish, lines, failed, but, later, in, the, year, alfred, saw, a, means, of, obstructing, the, river, to, prevent, the, egress, of, the, danish, ships, the, danes, realised, that, they, were, outmanoeuvred, struck, off, north, westwards, and, wintered, at, cwatbridge, near, bridgnorth, the, next, year, 896, or, 897, they, gave, up, the, struggle, some, retired, to, northumbria, some, to, east, anglia, those, who, had, no, connections, in, england, returned, to, the, continent, the, germanic, tribes, who, invaded, britain, in, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, relied, upon, the, unarmoured, infantry, supplied, by, their, tribal, levy, or, fyrd, and, it, was, upon, this, system, that, the, military, power, of, the, several, kingdoms, of, early, anglo, saxon, england, depended, the, fyrd, was, a, local, militia, in, the, anglo, saxon, shire, in, which, all, freemen, had, to, serve, those, who, refused, military, service, were, subject, to, fines, or, loss, of, their, land, according, to, the, law, code, of, king, ine, of, wessex, issued, in, c, 694, if, a, nobleman, who, holds, land, neglects, military, service, he, shall, pay, 120, shillings, and, forfeit, his, land, a, nobleman, who, holds, no, land, shall, pay, 60, shillings, a, commoner, shall, pay, a, fine, of, 30, shillings, for, neglecting, military, service, wessex, s, history, of, failures, preceding, alfred, s, success, in, 878, emphasised, to, him, that, the, traditional, system, of, battle, he, had, inherited, played, to, the, danes, advantage, while, the, anglo, saxons, and, the, danes, attacked, settlements, for, plunder, they, employed, different, tactics, in, their, raids, the, anglo, saxons, traditionally, preferred, to, attack, head, on, by, assembling, their, forces, in, a, shield, wall, advancing, against, their, target, and, overcoming, the, oncoming, wall, marshalled, against, them, in, defence, the, danes, preferred, to, choose, easy, targets, mapping, cautious, forays, to, avoid, risking, their, plunder, with, high, stake, attacks, for, more, alfred, determined, their, tactic, was, to, launch, small, attacks, from, a, secure, base, to, which, they, could, retreat, should, their, raiders, meet, strong, resistance, the, bases, were, prepared, in, advance, often, by, capturing, an, estate, and, augmenting, its, defences, with, ditches, ramparts, and, palisades, once, inside, the, fortification, alfred, realised, the, danes, enjoyed, the, advantage, better, situated, to, outlast, their, opponents, or, crush, them, with, a, counter, attack, because, the, provisions, and, stamina, of, the, besieging, forces, waned, the, means, by, which, the, anglo, saxons, marshalled, forces, to, defend, against, marauders, also, left, them, vulnerable, to, the, vikings, it, was, the, responsibility, of, the, shire, fyrd, to, deal, with, local, raids, the, king, could, call, up, the, national, militia, to, defend, the, kingdom, but, in, the, case, of, the, viking, raids, problems, with, communication, and, raising, supplies, meant, that, the, national, militia, could, not, be, mustered, quickly, enough, it, was, only, after, the, raids, had, begun, that, a, call, went, out, to, landowners, to, gather, their, men, for, battle, large, regions, could, be, devastated, before, the, fyrd, could, assemble, and, arrive, although, the, landowners, were, obliged, to, the, king, to, supply, these, men, when, called, during, the, attacks, in, 878, many, of, them, abandoned, their, king, and, collaborated, with, guthrum, with, these, lessons, in, mind, alfred, capitalised, on, the, relatively, peaceful, years, following, his, victory, at, edington, with, an, ambitious, restructuring, of, saxon, defences, on, a, trip, to, rome, alfred, had, stayed, with, charles, the, bald, and, it, is, possible, that, he, may, have, studied, how, the, carolingian, kings, had, dealt, with, viking, raiders, learning, from, their, experiences, he, was, able, to, establish, a, system, of, taxation, and, defence, for, wessex, there, had, been, a, system, of, fortifications, in, pre, viking, mercia, that, may, have, been, an, influence, when, the, viking, raids, resumed, in, 892, alfred, was, better, prepared, to, confront, them, with, a, standing, mobile, field, army, a, network, of, garrisons, and, a, small, fleet, of, ships, navigating, the, rivers, and, estuaries, tenants, in, anglo, saxon, england, had, a, threefold, obligation, based, on, their, landholding, the, so, called, common, burdens, of, military, service, fortress, work, and, bridge, repair, this, threefold, obligation, has, traditionally, been, called, trinoda, necessitas, or, trimoda, necessitas, the, old, english, name, for, the, fine, due, for, neglecting, military, service, was, fierdwite, to, maintain, the, burhs, and, to, reorganise, the, fyrd, as, a, standing, army, alfred, expanded, the, tax, and, conscription, system, based, on, the, productivity, of, a, tenant, s, landholding, the, hide, was, the, basic, unit, of, the, system, on, which, the, tenant, s, public, obligations, were, assessed, a, hide, is, thought, to, represent, the, amount, of, land, required, to, support, one, family, the, hide, differed, in, size, according, to, the, value, and, resources, of, the, land, and, the, landowner, would, have, to, provide, service, based, on, how, many, hides, he, owned, the, foundation, of, alfred, s, new, military, defence, system, was, a, network, of, burhs, distributed, at, tactical, points, throughout, the, kingdom, there, were, thirty, three, burhs, about, 30, kilometres, 19, miles, apart, enabling, the, military, to, confront, attacks, anywhere, in, the, kingdom, within, a, day, alfred, s, burhs, of, which, 22, developed, into, boroughs, ranged, from, former, roman, towns, such, as, winchester, where, the, stone, walls, were, repaired, and, ditches, added, to, massive, earthen, walls, surrounded, by, wide, ditches, probably, reinforced, with, wooden, revetments, and, palisades, such, as, at, burpham, in, west, sussex, the, size, of, the, burhs, ranged, from, tiny, outposts, such, as, pilton, in, devon, to, large, fortifications, in, established, towns, the, largest, being, at, winchester, a, document, now, known, as, the, burghal, hidage, provides, an, insight, into, how, the, system, worked, it, lists, the, hidage, for, each, of, the, fortified, towns, contained, in, the, document, wallingford, had, a, hidage, of, 2, 400, which, meant, that, the, landowners, there, were, responsible, for, supplying, and, feeding, 2, 400, men, the, number, sufficient, for, maintaining, 9, 900, feet, 1, 88, miles, 3, 0, kilometres, of, wall, a, total, of, 27, 071, soldiers, were, needed, approximately, one, in, four, of, all, the, free, men, in, wessex, many, of, the, burhs, were, twin, towns, that, straddled, a, river, and, were, connected, by, a, fortified, bridge, like, those, built, by, charles, the, bald, a, generation, before, the, double, burh, blocked, passage, on, the, river, forcing, viking, ships, to, navigate, under, a, garrisoned, bridge, lined, with, men, armed, with, stones, spears, or, arrows, other, burhs, were, sited, near, fortified, royal, villas, allowing, the, king, better, control, over, his, strongholds, the, burhs, were, connected, by, a, road, system, maintained, for, army, use, known, as, herepaths, the, roads, allowed, an, army, quickly, to, be, assembled, sometimes, from, more, than, one, burh, to, confront, the, viking, invader, the, road, network, posed, significant, obstacles, to, viking, invaders, especially, those, laden, with, booty, the, system, threatened, viking, routes, and, communications, making, it, far, more, dangerous, for, them, the, vikings, lacked, the, equipment, for, a, siege, against, a, burh, and, a, developed, doctrine, of, siegecraft, having, tailored, their, methods, of, fighting, to, rapid, strikes, and, unimpeded, retreats, to, well, defended, fortifications, the, only, means, left, to, them, was, to, starve, the, burh, into, submission, but, this, gave, the, king, time, to, send, his, field, army, or, garrisons, from, neighbouring, burhs, along, the, army, roads, in, such, cases, the, vikings, were, extremely, vulnerable, to, pursuit, by, the, king, s, joint, military, forces, alfred, s, burh, system, posed, such, a, formidable, challenge, against, viking, attack, that, when, the, vikings, returned, in, 892, and, stormed, a, half, built, poorly, garrisoned, fortress, up, the, lympne, estuary, in, kent, the, anglo, saxons, were, able, to, limit, their, penetration, to, the, outer, frontiers, of, wessex, and, mercia, alfred, s, burghal, system, was, revolutionary, in, its, strategic, conception, and, potentially, expensive, in, its, execution, his, contemporary, biographer, asser, wrote, that, many, nobles, balked, at, the, demands, placed, upon, them, even, though, they, were, for, the, common, needs, of, the, kingdom, alfred, also, tried, his, hand, at, naval, design, in, 896, he, ordered, the, construction, of, a, small, fleet, perhaps, a, dozen, or, so, longships, that, at, 60, oars, were, twice, the, size, of, viking, warships, this, was, not, as, the, victorians, asserted, the, birth, of, the, english, navy, wessex, had, possessed, a, royal, fleet, before, this, alfred, s, older, brother, sub, king, thelstan, of, kent, and, ealdorman, ealhhere, had, defeated, a, viking, fleet, in, 851, capturing, nine, ships, and, alfred, had, conducted, naval, actions, in, 882, the, year, 897, marked, an, important, development, in, the, naval, power, of, wessex, the, author, of, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, related, that, alfred, s, ships, were, larger, swifter, steadier, and, rode, higher, in, the, water, than, either, danish, or, frisian, ships, it, is, probable, that, under, the, classical, tutelage, of, asser, alfred, used, the, design, of, greek, and, roman, warships, with, high, sides, designed, for, fighting, rather, than, for, navigation, alfred, had, seapower, in, mind, if, he, could, intercept, raiding, fleets, before, they, landed, he, could, spare, his, kingdom, from, being, ravaged, alfred, s, ships, may, have, been, superior, in, conception, but, in, practice, they, proved, to, be, too, large, to, manoeuvre, well, in, the, close, waters, of, estuaries, and, rivers, the, only, places, in, which, a, naval, battle, could, be, fought, the, warships, of, the, time, were, not, designed, to, be, ship, killers, but, rather, troop, carriers, it, has, been, suggested, that, like, sea, battles, in, late, viking, age, scandinavia, these, battles, may, have, entailed, a, ship, coming, alongside, an, opposing, vessel, lashing, the, two, ships, together, and, then, boarding, the, craft, the, result, was, a, land, battle, involving, hand, to, hand, fighting, on, board, the, two, lashed, vessels, in, the, one, recorded, naval, engagement, in, 896, alfred, s, new, fleet, of, nine, ships, intercepted, six, viking, ships, at, the, mouth, of, an, unidentified, river, in, the, south, of, england, the, danes, had, beached, half, their, ships, and, gone, inland, alfred, s, ships, immediately, moved, to, block, their, escape, the, three, viking, ships, afloat, attempted, to, break, through, the, english, lines, only, one, made, it, alfred, s, ships, intercepted, the, other, two, lashing, the, viking, boats, to, their, own, the, english, crew, boarded, and, proceeded, to, kill, the, vikings, one, ship, escaped, because, alfred, s, heavy, ships, became, grounded, when, the, tide, went, out, a, land, battle, ensued, between, the, crews, the, danes, were, heavily, outnumbered, but, as, the, tide, rose, they, returned, to, their, boats, which, with, shallower, drafts, were, freed, first, the, english, watched, as, the, vikings, rowed, past, them, but, they, suffered, so, many, casualties, 120, dead, against, 62, frisians, and, english, that, they, had, difficulty, putting, out, to, sea, all, were, too, damaged, to, row, around, sussex, and, two, were, driven, against, the, sussex, coast, possibly, at, selsey, bill, the, shipwrecked, crew, were, brought, before, alfred, at, winchester, and, hanged, in, the, late, 880s, or, early, 890s, alfred, issued, a, long, domboc, or, law, code, consisting, of, his, own, laws, followed, by, a, code, issued, by, his, late, seventh, century, predecessor, king, ine, of, wessex, together, these, laws, are, arranged, into, 120, chapters, in, his, introduction, alfred, explains, that, he, gathered, together, the, laws, he, found, in, many, synod, books, and, ordered, to, be, written, many, of, the, ones, that, our, forefathers, observed, those, that, pleased, me, and, many, of, the, ones, that, did, not, please, me, i, rejected, with, the, advice, of, my, councillors, and, commanded, them, to, be, observed, in, a, different, way, alfred, singled, out, in, particular, the, laws, that, he, found, in, the, days, of, ine, my, kinsman, or, offa, king, of, the, mercians, or, king, thelberht, of, kent, who, first, among, the, english, people, received, baptism, he, appended, rather, than, integrated, the, laws, of, ine, into, his, code, and, although, he, included, as, had, thelbert, a, scale, of, payments, in, compensation, for, injuries, to, various, body, parts, the, two, injury, tariffs, are, not, aligned, offa, is, not, known, to, have, issued, a, law, code, leading, historian, patrick, wormald, to, speculate, that, alfred, had, in, mind, the, legatine, capitulary, of, 786, that, was, presented, to, offa, by, the, papal, legate, george, of, ostia, about, a, fifth, of, the, law, code, is, taken, up, by, alfred, s, introduction, which, includes, translations, into, english, of, the, ten, commandments, a, few, chapters, from, the, book, of, exodus, and, the, apostolic, letter, from, the, acts, of, the, apostles, 15, 23, 29, the, introduction, may, best, be, understood, as, alfred, s, meditation, upon, the, meaning, of, christian, law, it, traces, the, continuity, between, god, s, gift, of, law, to, moses, to, alfred, s, own, issuance, of, law, to, the, west, saxon, people, by, doing, so, it, linked, the, holy, past, to, the, historical, present, and, represented, alfred, s, law, giving, as, a, type, of, divine, legislation, similarly, alfred, divided, his, code, into, 120, chapters, because, 120, was, the, age, at, which, moses, died, and, in, the, number, symbolism, of, early, medieval, biblical, exegetes, 120, stood, for, law, the, link, between, mosaic, law, and, alfred, s, code, is, the, apostolic, letter, which, explained, that, christ, had, come, not, to, shatter, or, annul, the, commandments, but, to, fulfill, them, and, he, taught, mercy, and, meekness, intro, 49, 1, the, mercy, that, christ, infused, into, mosaic, law, underlies, the, injury, tariffs, that, figure, so, prominently, in, barbarian, law, codes, since, christian, synods, established, through, that, mercy, which, christ, taught, that, for, almost, every, misdeed, at, the, first, offence, secular, lords, might, with, their, permission, receive, without, sin, the, monetary, compensation, which, they, then, fixed, the, only, crime, that, could, not, be, compensated, with, a, payment, of, money, was, treachery, to, a, lord, since, almighty, god, adjudged, none, for, those, who, despised, him, nor, did, christ, the, son, of, god, adjudge, any, for, the, one, who, betrayed, him, to, death, and, he, commanded, everyone, to, love, his, lord, as, himself, alfred, s, transformation, of, christ, s, commandment, from, love, your, neighbour, as, yourself, matt, 22, 39, 40, to, love, your, secular, lord, as, you, would, love, the, lord, christ, himself, underscores, the, importance, that, alfred, placed, upon, lordship, which, he, understood, as, a, sacred, bond, instituted, by, god, for, the, governance, of, man, when, one, turns, from, the, domboc, s, introduction, to, the, laws, themselves, it, is, difficult, to, uncover, any, logical, arrangement, the, impression, is, of, a, hodgepodge, of, miscellaneous, laws, the, law, code, as, it, has, been, preserved, is, singularly, unsuitable, for, use, in, lawsuits, in, fact, several, of, alfred, s, laws, contradicted, the, laws, of, ine, that, form, an, integral, part, of, the, code, patrick, wormald, s, explanation, is, that, alfred, s, law, code, should, be, understood, not, as, a, legal, manual, but, as, an, ideological, manifesto, of, kingship, designed, more, for, symbolic, impact, than, for, practical, direction, in, practical, terms, the, most, important, law, in, the, code, may, well, have, been, the, first, we, enjoin, what, is, most, necessary, that, each, man, keep, carefully, his, oath, and, his, pledge, which, expresses, a, fundamental, tenet, of, anglo, saxon, law, alfred, devoted, considerable, attention, and, thought, to, judicial, matters, asser, underscores, his, concern, for, judicial, fairness, alfred, according, to, asser, insisted, upon, reviewing, contested, judgments, made, by, his, ealdormen, and, reeves, and, would, carefully, look, into, nearly, all, the, judgements, which, were, passed, in, his, absence, anywhere, in, the, realm, to, see, whether, they, were, just, or, unjust, a, charter, from, the, reign, of, his, son, edward, the, elder, depicts, alfred, as, hearing, one, such, appeal, in, his, chamber, while, washing, his, hands, asser, represents, alfred, as, a, solomonic, judge, painstaking, in, his, own, judicial, investigations, and, critical, of, royal, officials, who, rendered, unjust, or, unwise, judgments, although, asser, never, mentions, alfred, s, law, code, he, does, say, that, alfred, insisted, that, his, judges, be, literate, so, that, they, could, apply, themselves, to, the, pursuit, of, wisdom, the, failure, to, comply, with, this, royal, order, was, to, be, punished, by, loss, of, office, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, commissioned, at, the, time, of, alfred, was, probably, written, to, promote, unification, of, england, whereas, asser, s, the, life, of, king, alfred, promoted, alfred, s, achievements, and, personal, qualities, it, was, possible, that, the, document, was, designed, this, way, so, that, it, could, be, disseminated, in, wales, because, alfred, had, acquired, overlordship, of, that, country, asser, speaks, grandiosely, of, alfred, s, relations, with, foreign, powers, but, little, definite, information, is, available, his, interest, in, foreign, countries, is, shown, by, the, insertions, which, he, made, in, his, translation, of, orosius, he, corresponded, with, elias, iii, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, and, embassies, to, rome, conveying, the, english, alms, to, the, pope, were, fairly, frequent, around, 890, wulfstan, of, hedeby, undertook, a, journey, from, hedeby, on, jutland, along, the, baltic, sea, to, the, prussian, trading, town, of, truso, alfred, personally, collected, details, of, this, trip, alfred, s, relations, with, the, celtic, princes, in, the, western, half, of, great, britain, are, clearer, comparatively, early, in, his, reign, according, to, asser, the, southern, welsh, princes, owing, to, the, pressure, on, them, from, north, wales, and, mercia, commended, themselves, to, alfred, later, in, his, reign, the, north, welsh, followed, their, example, and, the, latter, cooperated, with, the, english, in, the, campaign, of, 893, or, 894, that, alfred, sent, alms, to, irish, and, continental, monasteries, may, be, taken, on, asser, s, authority, the, visit, of, three, pilgrim, scots, i, e, irish, to, alfred, in, 891, is, undoubtedly, authentic, the, story, that, in, his, childhood, he, was, sent, to, ireland, to, be, healed, by, saint, modwenna, may, show, alfred, s, interest, in, that, island, in, the, 880s, at, the, same, time, that, he, was, cajoling, and, threatening, his, nobles, to, build, and, man, the, burhs, alfred, perhaps, inspired, by, the, example, of, charlemagne, almost, a, century, before, undertook, an, equally, ambitious, effort, to, revive, learning, during, this, period, the, viking, raids, were, often, seen, as, a, divine, punishment, and, alfred, may, have, wished, to, revive, religious, awe, in, order, to, appease, god, s, wrath, this, revival, entailed, the,

own, children, the, sons, of, his, nobles, and, intellectually, promising, boys, of, lesser, birth, an, attempt, to, require, literacy, in, those, who, held, offices, of, authority, a, series, of, translations, into, the, vernacular, of, latin, works, the, king, deemed, most, necessary, for, all, men, to, know, the, compilation, of, a, chronicle, detailing, the, rise, of, alfred, s, kingdom, and, house, with, a, genealogy, that, stretched, back, to, adam, thus, giving, the, west, saxon, kings, a, biblical, ancestry, very, little, is, known, of, the, church, under, alfred, the, danish, attacks, had, been, particularly, damaging, to, the, monasteries, although, alfred, founded, monasteries, at, athelney, and, shaftesbury, these, were, the, first, new, monastic, houses, in, wessex, since, the, beginning, of, the, eighth, century, according, to, asser, alfred, enticed, foreign, monks, to, england, for, his, monastery, at, athelney, because, there, was, little, interest, for, the, locals, to, take, up, the, monastic, life, alfred, undertook, no, systematic, reform, of, ecclesiastical, institutions, or, religious, practices, in, wessex, for, him, the, key, to, the, kingdom, s, spiritual, revival, was, to, appoint, pious, learned, and, trustworthy, bishops, and, abbots, as, king, he, saw, himself, as, responsible, for, both, the, temporal, and, spiritual, welfare, of, his, subjects, secular, and, spiritual, authority, were, not, distinct, categories, for, alfred, he, was, equally, comfortable, distributing, his, translation, of, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, to, his, bishops, so, that, they, might, better, train, and, supervise, priests, and, using, those, same, bishops, as, royal, officials, and, judges, nor, did, his, piety, prevent, him, from, expropriating, strategically, sited, church, lands, especially, estates, along, the, border, with, the, danelaw, and, transferring, them, to, royal, thegns, and, officials, who, could, better, defend, them, against, viking, attacks, the, danish, raids, had, a, devastating, effect, on, learning, in, england, alfred, lamented, in, the, preface, to, his, translation, of, gregory, s, pastoral, care, that, learning, had, declined, so, thoroughly, in, england, that, there, were, very, few, men, on, this, side, of, the, humber, who, could, understand, their, divine, services, in, english, or, even, translate, a, single, letter, from, latin, into, english, and, i, suppose, that, there, were, not, many, beyond, the, humber, either, alfred, undoubtedly, exaggerated, for, dramatic, effect, the, abysmal, state, of, learning, in, england, during, his, youth, that, latin, learning, had, not, been, obliterated, is, evidenced, by, the, presence, in, his, court, of, learned, mercian, and, west, saxon, clerics, such, as, plegmund, w, ferth, and, wulfsige, manuscript, production, in, england, dropped, off, precipitously, around, the, 860s, when, the, viking, invasions, began, in, earnest, not, to, be, revived, until, the, end, of, the, century, numerous, anglo, saxon, manuscripts, burnt, along, with, the, churches, that, housed, them, a, solemn, diploma, from, christ, church, canterbury, dated, 873, is, so, poorly, constructed, and, written, that, historian, nicholas, brooks, posited, a, scribe, who, was, either, so, blind, he, could, not, read, what, he, wrote, or, who, knew, little, or, no, latin, it, is, clear, brooks, concludes, that, the, metropolitan, church, must, have, been, quite, unable, to, provide, any, effective, training, in, the, scriptures, or, in, christian, worship, alfred, established, a, court, school, for, the, education, of, his, own, children, those, of, the, nobility, and, a, good, many, of, lesser, birth, there, they, studied, books, in, both, english, and, latin, and, devoted, themselves, to, writing, to, such, an, extent, they, were, seen, to, be, devoted, and, intelligent, students, of, the, liberal, arts, he, recruited, scholars, from, the, continent, and, from, britain, to, aid, in, the, revival, of, christian, learning, in, wessex, and, to, provide, the, king, personal, instruction, grimbald, and, john, the, saxon, came, from, francia, plegmund, whom, alfred, appointed, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 890, bishop, w, rferth, of, worcester, thelstan, and, the, royal, chaplains, werwulf, from, mercia, and, asser, from, saint, david, s, in, southwestern, wales, alfred, s, educational, ambitions, seem, to, have, extended, beyond, the, establishment, of, a, court, school, believing, that, without, christian, wisdom, there, can, be, neither, prosperity, nor, success, in, war, alfred, aimed, to, set, to, learning, as, long, as, they, are, not, useful, for, some, other, employment, all, the, free, born, young, men, now, in, england, who, have, the, means, to, apply, themselves, to, it, conscious, of, the, decay, of, latin, literacy, in, his, realm, alfred, proposed, that, primary, education, be, taught, in, english, with, those, wishing, to, advance, to, holy, orders, to, continue, their, studies, in, latin, there, were, few, books, of, wisdom, written, in, english, alfred, sought, to, remedy, this, through, an, ambitious, court, centred, programme, of, translating, into, english, the, books, he, deemed, most, necessary, for, all, men, to, know, it, is, unknown, when, alfred, launched, this, programme, but, it, may, have, been, during, the, 880s, when, wessex, was, enjoying, a, respite, from, viking, attacks, alfred, was, until, recently, often, considered, to, have, been, the, author, of, many, of, the, translations, but, this, is, now, considered, doubtful, in, almost, all, cases, scholars, more, often, refer, to, translations, as, alfredian, indicating, that, they, probably, had, something, to, do, with, his, patronage, but, are, unlikely, to, be, his, own, work, apart, from, the, lost, handboc, or, encheiridio, which, seems, to, have, been, a, commonplace, book, kept, by, the, king, the, earliest, work, to, be, translated, was, the, dialogues, of, gregory, the, great, a, book, greatly, popular, in, the, middle, ages, the, translation, was, undertaken, at, alfred, s, command, by, w, rferth, bishop, of, worcester, with, the, king, merely, furnishing, a, preface, remarkably, alfred, undoubtedly, with, the, advice, and, aid, of, his, court, scholars, translated, four, works, himself, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, boethius, s, consolation, of, philosophy, st, augustine, s, soliloquies, and, the, first, fifty, psalms, of, the, psalter, one, might, add, to, this, list, the, translation, in, alfred, s, law, code, of, excerpts, from, the, vulgate, book, of, exodus, the, old, english, versions, of, orosius, s, histories, against, the, pagans, and, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, are, no, longer, accepted, by, scholars, as, alfred, s, own, translations, because, of, lexical, and, stylistic, differences, nonetheless, the, consensus, remains, that, they, were, part, of, the, alfredian, programme, of, translation, simon, keynes, and, michael, lapidge, suggest, this, also, for, bald, s, leechbook, and, the, anonymous, old, english, martyrology, the, preface, of, alfred, s, translation, of, pope, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, explained, why, he, thought, it, necessary, to, translate, works, such, as, this, from, latin, into, english, although, he, described, his, method, as, translating, sometimes, word, for, word, sometimes, sense, for, sense, the, translation, keeps, very, close, to, the, original, although, through, his, choice, of, language, he, blurred, throughout, the, distinction, between, spiritual, and, secular, authority, alfred, meant, the, translation, to, be, used, and, circulated, it, to, all, his, bishops, interest, in, alfred, s, translation, of, pastoral, care, was, so, enduring, that, copies, were, still, being, made, in, the, 11th, century, boethius, s, consolation, of, philosophy, was, the, most, popular, philosophical, handbook, of, the, middle, ages, unlike, the, translation, of, the, pastoral, care, the, alfredian, text, deals, very, freely, with, the, original, and, though, the, late, dr, g, schepss, showed, that, many, of, the, additions, to, the, text, are, to, be, traced, not, to, the, translator, himself, but, to, the, glosses, and, commentaries, which, he, used, still, there, is, much, in, the, work, which, is, distinctive, to, the, translation, and, has, been, taken, to, reflect, philosophies, of, kingship, in, alfred, s, milieu, it, is, in, the, boethius, that, the, oft, quoted, sentence, occurs, to, speak, briefly, i, desired, to, live, worthily, as, long, as, i, lived, and, after, my, life, to, leave, to, them, that, should, come, after, my, memory, in, good, works, the, book, has, come, down, to, us, in, two, manuscripts, only, in, one, of, these, the, writing, is, prose, in, the, other, a, combination, of, prose, and, alliterating, verse, the, latter, manuscript, was, severely, damaged, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, last, of, the, alfredian, works, is, one, which, bears, the, name, blostman, blooms, or, anthology, the, first, half, is, based, mainly, on, the, soliloquies, of, st, augustine, of, hippo, the, remainder, is, drawn, from, various, sources, the, material, has, traditionally, been, thought, to, contain, much, that, is, alfred, s, own, and, highly, characteristic, of, him, the, last, words, of, it, may, be, quoted, they, form, a, fitting, epitaph, for, the, noblest, of, english, kings, therefore, he, seems, to, me, a, very, foolish, man, and, truly, wretched, who, will, not, increase, his, understanding, while, he, is, in, the, world, and, ever, wish, and, long, to, reach, that, endless, life, where, all, shall, be, made, clear, alfred, appears, as, a, character, in, the, twelfth, or, 13th, century, poem, the, owl, and, the, nightingale, where, his, wisdom, and, skill, with, proverbs, is, praised, the, proverbs, of, alfred, a, 13th, century, work, contains, sayings, that, are, not, likely, to, have, originated, with, alfred, but, attest, to, his, posthumous, medieval, reputation, for, wisdom, the, alfred, jewel, discovered, in, somerset, in, 1693, has, long, been, associated, with, king, alfred, because, of, its, old, english, inscription, aelfred, mec, heht, gewyrcan, alfred, ordered, me, to, be, made, the, jewel, is, about, 2, 5, inches, 6, 4, centimetres, long, made, of, filigreed, gold, enclosing, a, highly, polished, piece, of, quartz, crystal, beneath, which, is, set, in, a, cloisonn, enamel, plaque, with, an, enamelled, image, of, a, man, holding, floriate, sceptres, perhaps, personifying, sight, or, the, wisdom, of, god, it, was, at, one, time, attached, to, a, thin, rod, or, stick, based, on, the, hollow, socket, at, its, base, the, jewel, certainly, dates, from, alfred, s, reign, although, its, function, is, unknown, it, has, been, often, suggested, that, the, jewel, was, one, of, the, stels, pointers, for, reading, that, alfred, ordered, sent, to, every, bishopric, accompanying, a, copy, of, his, translation, of, the, pastoral, care, each, stel, was, worth, the, princely, sum, of, 50, mancuses, which, fits, in, well, with, the, quality, workmanship, and, expensive, materials, of, the, alfred, jewel, historian, richard, abels, sees, alfred, s, educational, and, military, reforms, as, complementary, restoring, religion, and, learning, in, wessex, abels, contends, was, to, alfred, s, mind, as, essential, to, the, defence, of, his, realm, as, the, building, of, the, burhs, as, alfred, observed, in, the, preface, to, his, english, translation, of, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, kings, who, fail, to, obey, their, divine, duty, to, promote, learning, can, expect, earthly, punishments, to, befall, their, people, the, pursuit, of, wisdom, he, assured, his, readers, of, the, boethius, was, the, surest, path, to, power, study, wisdom, then, and, when, you, have, learned, it, condemn, it, not, for, i, tell, you, that, by, its, means, you, may, without, fail, attain, to, power, yea, even, though, not, desiring, it, the, portrayal, of, the, west, saxon, resistance, to, the, vikings, by, asser, and, the, chronicler, as, a, christian, holy, war, was, more, than, mere, rhetoric, or, propaganda, it, reflected, alfred, s, own, belief, in, a, doctrine, of, divine, rewards, and, punishments, rooted, in, a, vision, of, a, hierarchical, christian, world, order, in, which, god, is, the, lord, to, whom, kings, owe, obedience, and, through, whom, they, derive, their, authority, over, their, followers, the, need, to, persuade, his, nobles, to, undertake, work, for, the, common, good, led, alfred, and, his, court, scholars, to, strengthen, and, deepen, the, conception, of, christian, kingship, that, he, had, inherited, by, building, upon, the, legacy, of, earlier, kings, including, offa, clerical, writers, including, bede, and, alcuin, and, various, participants, in, the, carolingian, renaissance, this, was, not, a, cynical, use, of, religion, to, manipulate, his, subjects, into, obedience, but, an, intrinsic, element, in, alfred, s, worldview, he, believed, as, did, other, kings, in, ninth, century, england, and, francia, that, god, had, entrusted, him, with, the, spiritual, as, well, as, physical, welfare, of, his, people, if, the, christian, faith, fell, into, ruin, in, his, kingdom, if, the, clergy, were, too, ignorant, to, understand, the, latin, words, they, butchered, in, their, offices, and, liturgies, if, the, ancient, monasteries, and, collegiate, churches, lay, deserted, out, of, indifference, he, was, answerable, before, god, as, josiah, had, been, alfred, s, ultimate, responsibility, was, the, pastoral, care, of, his, people, asser, wrote, of, alfred, in, his, life, of, king, alfred, now, he, was, greatly, loved, more, than, all, his, brothers, by, his, father, and, mother, indeed, by, everybody, with, a, universal, and, profound, love, and, he, was, always, brought, up, in, the, royal, court, and, nowhere, else, was, seen, to, be, more, comely, in, appearance, than, his, other, brothers, and, more, pleasing, in, manner, speech, and, behaviour, in, spite, of, all, the, demands, of, the, present, life, it, has, been, the, desire, for, wisdom, more, than, anything, else, together, with, the, nobility, of, his, birth, which, have, characterized, the, nature, of, his, noble, mind, it, is, also, written, by, asser, that, alfred, did, not, learn, to, read, until, he, was, 12, years, old, or, later, which, is, described, as, shameful, negligence, of, his, parents, and, tutors, alfred, was, an, excellent, listener, and, had, an, incredible, memory, and, he, retained, poetry, and, psalms, very, well, a, story, is, told, by, asser, about, how, his, mother, held, up, a, book, of, saxon, poetry, to, him, and, his, brothers, and, said, i, shall, give, this, book, to, whichever, one, of, you, can, learn, it, the, fastest, after, excitedly, asking, will, you, really, give, this, book, to, the, one, of, us, who, can, understand, it, the, soonest, and, recite, it, to, you, alfred, then, took, it, to, his, teacher, learned, it, and, recited, it, back, to, his, mother, alfred, is, noted, as, carrying, around, a, small, book, probably, a, medieval, version, of, a, small, pocket, notebook, that, contained, psalms, and, many, prayers, that, he, often, collected, asser, writes, these, he, collected, in, a, single, book, as, i, have, seen, for, myself, amid, all, the, affairs, of, the, present, life, he, took, it, around, with, him, everywhere, for, the, sake, of, prayer, and, was, inseparable, from, it, an, excellent, hunter, in, every, branch, of, the, sport, alfred, is, remembered, as, an, enthusiastic, huntsman, against, whom, nobody, s, skills, could, compare, he, was, the, youngest, of, his, brothers, and, he, was, probably, the, most, open, minded, he, was, an, early, advocate, for, education, his, desire, for, learning, could, have, come, from, his, early, love, of, english, poetry, and, inability, to, read, or, physically, record, it, until, later, in, life, asser, writes, that, alfred, could, not, satisfy, his, craving, for, what, he, desired, the, most, namely, the, liberal, arts, for, as, he, used, to, say, there, were, no, good, scholars, in, the, entire, kingdom, of, the, west, saxons, at, that, time, in, 868, alfred, married, ealhswith, daughter, of, a, mercian, nobleman, thelred, mucel, ealdorman, of, the, gaini, the, gaini, were, probably, one, of, the, tribal, groups, of, the, mercians, ealhswith, s, mother, eadburh, was, a, member, of, the, mercian, royal, family, they, had, five, or, six, children, together, including, edward, the, elder, who, succeeded, his, father, as, king, thelfl, d, who, became, lady, of, the, mercians, and, lfthryth, who, married, baldwin, ii, count, of, flanders, alfred, s, mother, was, osburga, daughter, of, oslac, of, the, isle, of, wight, chief, butler, of, england, asser, in, his, vita, lfredi, asserts, that, this, shows, his, lineage, from, the, jutes, of, the, isle, of, wight, osferth, was, described, as, a, relative, in, king, alfred, s, will, and, he, attested, charters, in, a, high, position, until, 934, a, charter, of, king, edward, s, reign, described, him, as, the, king, s, brother, mistakenly, according, to, keynes, and, lapidge, but, in, the, view, of, janet, nelson, he, probably, was, an, illegitimate, son, of, king, alfred, alfred, died, on, 26, october, 899, at, the, age, of, 50, or, 51, how, he, died, is, unknown, but, he, suffered, throughout, his, life, with, a, painful, and, unpleasant, illness, his, biographer, asser, gave, a, detailed, description, of, alfred, s, symptoms, and, this, has, allowed, modern, doctors, to, provide, a, possible, diagnosis, it, is, thought, that, he, had, either, crohn, s, disease, or, haemorrhoids, his, grandson, king, eadred, seems, to, have, had, a, similar, illness, alfred, was, temporarily, buried, at, the, old, minster, in, winchester, with, his, wife, ealhswith, and, later, his, son, edward, the, elder, before, his, death, he, had, ordered, the, construction, of, the, new, minster, hoping, that, it, would, become, a, mausoleum, for, him, and, his, family, four, years, after, his, death, the, bodies, of, alfred, and, his, family, were, exhumed, and, moved, to, their, new, resting, place, in, the, new, minster, and, remained, there, for, 211, years, when, william, the, conqueror, rose, to, the, english, throne, after, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, many, anglo, saxon, abbeys, were, demolished, and, replaced, with, norman, cathedrals, one, of, those, unfortunate, abbeys, was, the, very, new, minster, abbey, where, alfred, was, laid, to, rest, before, demolition, the, monks, at, the, new, minster, exhumed, the, bodies, of, alfred, and, his, family, to, safely, transfer, them, to, a, new, location, the, new, minster, monks, moved, to, hyde, in, 1110, a, little, north, of, the, city, and, they, transferred, to, hyde, abbey, along, with, alfred, s, body, and, those, of, his, wife, and, children, which, were, interred, before, the, high, altar, many, churches, were, vandalised, during, the, english, reformation, including, hyde, the, abbey, was, dissolved, in, 1538, the, church, and, cloister, were, demolished, and, treated, like, a, quarry, and, the, stones, that, made, up, the, abbey, were, then, re, used, in, local, architecture, the, stone, graves, housing, alfred, and, his, family, stayed, underground, and, the, land, returned, to, farming, these, graves, remained, intact, until, 1788, when, the, site, was, acquired, by, the, county, for, the, construction, of, a, town, jail, before, construction, began, convicts, that, would, later, be, imprisoned, at, the, site, were, sent, in, to, prepare, the, ground, to, ready, it, for, building, while, digging, the, foundation, trenches, the, convicts, discovered, the, coffins, of, alfred, and, his, family, a, local, roman, catholic, priest, dr, milner, recounted, this, event, thus, miscreants, couch, amidst, the, ashes, of, our, alfreds, and, edwards, and, where, once, religious, silence, and, contemplation, were, only, interrupted, by, the, bell, of, regular, observance, the, chanting, of, devotion, now, alone, resound, the, clank, of, the, captives, chains, and, the, oaths, of, the, profligate, in, digging, for, the, foundation, of, that, mournful, edifice, at, almost, every, stroke, of, the, mattock, or, spade, some, ancient, sepulchre, was, violated, the, venerable, contents, of, which, were, treated, with, marked, indignity, on, this, occasion, a, great, number, of, stone, coffins, were, dug, up, with, a, variety, of, other, curious, articles, such, as, chalices, patens, rings, buckles, the, leather, of, shoes, and, boots, velvet, and, gold, lace, belonging, to, chasubles, and, other, vestments, as, also, the, crook, rims, and, joints, of, a, beautiful, crosier, double, gilt, the, convicts, broke, the, stone, coffins, into, pieces, the, lead, which, lined, the, coffins, was, sold, for, two, guineas, and, the, bones, within, scattered, around, the, area, the, prison, was, demolished, between, 1846, and, 1850, further, excavations, were, inconclusive, in, 1866, and, 1897, in, 1866, amateur, antiquarian, john, mellor, claimed, to, have, recovered, a, number, of, bones, from, the, site, which, he, said, were, those, of, alfred, these, came, into, the, possession, of, the, vicar, of, nearby, st, bartholomew, s, church, who, reburied, them, in, an, unmarked, grave, in, the, church, graveyard, excavations, conducted, by, the, winchester, museums, service, of, the, hyde, abbey, site, in, 1999, located, a, second, pit, dug, in, front, of, where, the, high, altar, would, have, been, located, which, was, identified, as, probably, dating, to, mellor, s, 1866, excavation, the, 1999, archaeological, excavation, uncovered, the, foundations, of, the, abbey, buildings, and, some, bones, suggested, at, the, time, to, be, those, of, alfred, they, proved, instead, to, belong, to, an, elderly, woman, in, march, 2013, the, diocese, of, winchester, exhumed, the, bones, from, the, unmarked, grave, at, st, bartholomew, s, and, placed, them, in, secure, storage, the, diocese, made, no, claim, that, they, were, the, bones, of, alfred, but, intended, to, secure, them, for, later, analysis, and, from, the, attentions, of, people, whose, interest, may, have, been, sparked, by, the, recent, identification, of, the, remains, of, richard, iii, the, bones, were, radiocarbon, dated, but, the, results, showed, that, they, were, from, the, 1300s, and, therefore, not, of, alfred, in, january, 2014, a, fragment, of, pelvis, that, had, been, unearthed, in, the, 1999, excavation, of, the, hyde, site, and, had, subsequently, lain, in, a, winchester, museum, store, room, was, radiocarbon, dated, to, the, correct, period, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, bone, may, belong, to, either, alfred, or, his, son, edward, but, this, remains, unproven, henry, vi, of, england, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, have, alfred, canonised, by, pope, eugene, iv, in, 1441, the, current, roman, martyrology, does, not, mention, alfred, the, anglican, communion, venerates, him, as, a, christian, hero, with, a, lesser, festival, on, 26, october, and, he, may, often, be, found, depicted, in, stained, glass, in, church, of, england, parish, churches, in, 2007, the, holy, synod, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, canonised, all, saints, of, the, british, isles, including, king, alfred, he, is, honoured, during, the, feast, of, all, saints, of, the, british, isles, on, the, third, sunday, after, pentecost, and, on, his, feast, day, of, 26, october, there, is, an, orthodox, mission, named, after, st, alfred, in, middleburg, florida, alfred, commissioned, bishop, asser, to, write, his, biography, which, inevitably, emphasised, alfred, s, positive, aspects, later, medieval, historians, such, as, geoffrey, of, monmouth, also, reinforced, alfred, s, favourable, image, by, the, time, of, the, reformation, alfred, was, seen, as, a, pious, christian, ruler, who, promoted, the, use, of, english, rather, than, latin, and, so, the, translations, that, he, commissioned, were, viewed, as, untainted, by, the, later, roman, catholic, influences, of, the, normans, consequently, while, alfred, s, epithet, the,
