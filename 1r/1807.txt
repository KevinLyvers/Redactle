benoit, b, mandelbrot, 20, november, 1924, 14, october, 2010, was, a, polish, born, french, american, mathematician, and, polymath, with, broad, interests, in, the, practical, sciences, especially, regarding, what, he, labeled, as, the, art, of, roughness, of, physical, phenomena, and, the, uncontrolled, element, in, life, he, referred, to, himself, as, a, fractalist, and, is, recognized, for, his, contribution, to, the, field, of, fractal, geometry, which, included, coining, the, word, fractal, as, well, as, developing, a, theory, of, roughness, and, self, similarity, in, nature, in, 1936, at, the, age, of, 11, mandelbrot, and, his, family, emigrated, from, warsaw, poland, to, france, after, world, war, ii, ended, mandelbrot, studied, mathematics, graduating, from, universities, in, paris, and, in, the, united, states, and, receiving, a, master, s, degree, in, aeronautics, from, the, california, institute, of, technology, he, spent, most, of, his, career, in, both, the, united, states, and, france, having, dual, french, and, american, citizenship, in, 1958, he, began, a, 35, year, career, at, ibm, where, he, became, an, ibm, fellow, and, periodically, took, leaves, of, absence, to, teach, at, harvard, university, at, harvard, following, the, publication, of, his, study, of, u, s, commodity, markets, in, relation, to, cotton, futures, he, taught, economics, and, applied, sciences, because, of, his, access, to, ibm, s, computers, mandelbrot, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, computer, graphics, to, create, and, display, fractal, geometric, images, leading, to, his, discovery, of, the, mandelbrot, set, in, 1980, he, showed, how, visual, complexity, can, be, created, from, simple, rules, he, said, that, things, typically, considered, to, be, rough, a, mess, or, chaotic, such, as, clouds, or, shorelines, actually, had, a, degree, of, order, his, math, and, geometry, centered, research, included, contributions, to, such, fields, as, statistical, physics, meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology, anatomy, taxonomy, neurology, linguistics, information, technology, computer, graphics, economics, geology, medicine, physical, cosmology, engineering, chaos, theory, econophysics, metallurgy, and, the, social, sciences, toward, the, end, of, his, career, he, was, sterling, professor, of, mathematical, sciences, at, yale, university, where, he, was, the, oldest, professor, in, yale, s, history, to, receive, tenure, mandelbrot, also, held, positions, at, the, pacific, northwest, national, laboratory, universit, lille, nord, de, france, institute, for, advanced, study, and, centre, national, de, la, recherche, scientifique, during, his, career, he, received, over, 15, honorary, doctorates, and, served, on, many, science, journals, along, with, winning, numerous, awards, his, autobiography, the, fractalist, memoir, of, a, scientific, maverick, was, published, posthumously, in, 2012, benedykt, mandelbrot, was, born, in, a, lithuanian, jewish, family, in, warsaw, during, the, second, polish, republic, his, father, made, his, living, trading, clothing, his, mother, was, a, dental, surgeon, during, his, first, two, school, years, he, was, tutored, privately, by, an, uncle, who, despised, rote, learning, most, of, my, time, was, spent, playing, chess, reading, maps, and, learning, how, to, open, my, eyes, to, everything, around, me, in, 1936, when, he, was, 11, the, family, emigrated, from, poland, to, france, the, move, world, war, ii, and, the, influence, of, his, father, s, brother, the, mathematician, szolem, mandelbrojt, who, had, moved, to, paris, around, 1920, further, prevented, a, standard, education, the, fact, that, my, parents, as, economic, and, political, refugees, joined, szolem, in, france, saved, our, lives, he, writes, 17, mandelbrot, attended, the, lyc, e, rollin, now, the, coll, ge, lyc, e, jacques, decour, in, paris, until, the, start, of, world, war, ii, when, his, family, moved, to, tulle, france, he, was, helped, by, rabbi, david, feuerwerker, the, rabbi, of, brive, la, gaillarde, to, continue, his, studies, 62, 63, much, of, france, was, occupied, by, the, nazis, at, the, time, and, mandelbrot, recalls, this, period, our, constant, fear, was, that, a, sufficiently, determined, foe, might, report, us, to, an, authority, and, we, would, be, sent, to, our, deaths, this, happened, to, a, close, friend, from, paris, zina, morhange, a, physician, in, a, nearby, county, seat, simply, to, eliminate, the, competition, another, physician, denounced, her, we, escaped, this, fate, who, knows, why, 49, in, 1944, mandelbrot, returned, to, paris, studied, at, the, lyc, e, du, parc, in, lyon, and, in, 1945, to, 1947, attended, the, cole, polytechnique, where, he, studied, under, gaston, julia, and, paul, l, vy, from, 1947, to, 1949, he, studied, at, california, institute, of, technology, where, he, earned, a, master, s, degree, in, aeronautics, returning, to, france, he, obtained, his, phd, degree, in, mathematical, sciences, at, the, university, of, paris, in, 1952, from, 1949, to, 1958, mandelbrot, was, a, staff, member, at, the, centre, national, de, la, recherche, scientifique, during, this, time, he, spent, a, year, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, where, he, was, sponsored, by, john, von, neumann, in, 1955, he, married, aliette, kagan, and, moved, to, geneva, switzerland, to, collaborate, with, jean, piaget, at, the, international, centre, for, genetic, epistemology, and, later, to, the, universit, lille, nord, de, france, in, 1958, the, couple, moved, to, the, united, states, where, mandelbrot, joined, the, research, staff, at, the, ibm, thomas, j, watson, research, center, in, yorktown, heights, new, york, he, remained, at, ibm, for, 35, years, becoming, an, ibm, fellow, and, later, fellow, emeritus, from, 1951, onward, mandelbrot, worked, on, problems, and, published, papers, not, only, in, mathematics, but, in, applied, fields, such, as, information, theory, economics, and, fluid, dynamics, mandelbrot, saw, financial, markets, as, an, example, of, wild, randomness, characterized, by, concentration, and, long, range, dependence, he, developed, several, original, approaches, for, modelling, financial, fluctuations, in, his, early, work, he, found, that, the, price, changes, in, financial, markets, did, not, follow, a, gaussian, distribution, but, rather, l, vy, stable, distributions, having, infinite, variance, he, found, for, example, that, cotton, prices, followed, a, l, vy, stable, distribution, with, parameter, equal, to, 1, 7, rather, than, 2, as, in, a, gaussian, distribution, stable, distributions, have, the, property, that, the, sum, of, many, instances, of, a, random, variable, follows, the, same, distribution, but, with, a, larger, scale, parameter, the, latter, work, from, the, early, 60s, was, done, with, daily, data, of, cotton, prices, from, 1900, long, before, he, introduced, the, word, fractal, in, later, years, after, the, concept, of, fractals, had, matured, the, study, of, financial, markets, in, the, context, of, fractals, became, possible, only, after, the, availability, of, high, frequency, data, in, finance, in, the, late, 1980s, mandelbrot, used, intra, daily, tick, data, supplied, by, olsen, associates, in, zurich, to, apply, fractal, theory, to, market, microstructure, this, cooperation, led, to, the, publication, of, the, first, comprehensive, papers, on, scaling, law, in, finance, this, law, shows, similar, properties, at, different, time, scales, confirming, mandelbrot, s, insight, of, the, fractal, nature, of, market, microstructure, mandelbrot, s, own, research, in, this, area, is, presented, in, his, books, fractals, and, scaling, in, finance, and, the, mis, behavior, of, markets, as, a, visiting, professor, at, harvard, university, mandelbrot, began, to, study, mathematical, objects, called, julia, sets, that, were, invariant, under, certain, transformations, of, the, complex, plane, building, on, previous, work, by, gaston, julia, and, pierre, fatou, mandelbrot, used, a, computer, to, plot, images, of, the, julia, sets, while, investigating, the, topology, of, these, julia, sets, he, studied, the, mandelbrot, set, which, was, introduced, by, him, in, 1979, in, 1975, mandelbrot, coined, the, term, fractal, to, describe, these, structures, and, first, published, his, ideas, in, the, french, book, les, objets, fractals, forme, hasard, et, dimension, later, translated, in, 1977, as, fractals, form, chance, and, dimension, according, to, computer, scientist, and, physicist, stephen, wolfram, the, book, was, a, breakthrough, for, mandelbrot, who, until, then, would, typically, apply, fairly, straightforward, mathematics, to, areas, that, had, barely, seen, the, light, of, serious, mathematics, before, wolfram, adds, that, as, a, result, of, this, new, research, he, was, no, longer, a, wandering, scientist, and, later, called, him, the, father, of, fractals, mandelbrot, ended, up, doing, a, great, piece, of, science, and, identifying, a, much, stronger, and, more, fundamental, idea, put, simply, that, there, are, some, geometric, shapes, which, he, called, fractals, that, are, equally, rough, at, all, scales, no, matter, how, close, you, look, they, never, get, simpler, much, as, the, section, of, a, rocky, coastline, you, can, see, at, your, feet, looks, just, as, jagged, as, the, stretch, you, can, see, from, space, wolfram, briefly, describes, fractals, as, a, form, of, geometric, repetition, in, which, smaller, and, smaller, copies, of, a, pattern, are, successively, nested, inside, each, other, so, that, the, same, intricate, shapes, appear, no, matter, how, much, you, zoom, in, to, the, whole, fern, leaves, and, romanesque, broccoli, are, two, examples, from, nature, he, points, out, an, unexpected, conclusion, one, might, have, thought, that, such, a, simple, and, fundamental, form, of, regularity, would, have, been, studied, for, hundreds, if, not, thousands, of, years, but, it, was, not, in, fact, it, rose, to, prominence, only, over, the, past, 30, or, so, years, almost, entirely, through, the, efforts, of, one, man, the, mathematician, benoit, mandelbrot, mandelbrot, used, the, term, fractal, as, it, derived, from, the, latin, word, fractus, defined, as, broken, or, shattered, glass, using, the, newly, developed, ibm, computers, at, his, disposal, mandelbrot, was, able, to, create, fractal, images, using, graphics, computer, code, images, that, an, interviewer, described, as, looking, like, the, delirious, exuberance, of, the, 1960s, psychedelic, art, with, forms, hauntingly, reminiscent, of, nature, and, the, human, body, he, also, saw, himself, as, a, would, be, kepler, after, the, 17th, century, scientist, johannes, kepler, who, calculated, and, described, the, orbits, of, the, planets, mandelbrot, however, never, felt, he, was, inventing, a, new, idea, he, described, his, feelings, in, a, documentary, with, science, writer, arthur, c, clarke, exploring, this, set, i, certainly, never, had, the, feeling, of, invention, i, never, had, the, feeling, that, my, imagination, was, rich, enough, to, invent, all, those, extraordinary, things, on, discovering, them, they, were, there, even, though, nobody, had, seen, them, before, it, s, marvelous, a, very, simple, formula, explains, all, these, very, complicated, things, so, the, goal, of, science, is, starting, with, a, mess, and, explaining, it, with, a, simple, formula, a, kind, of, dream, of, science, according, to, clarke, the, mandelbrot, set, is, indeed, one, of, the, most, astonishing, discoveries, in, the, entire, history, of, mathematics, who, could, have, dreamed, that, such, an, incredibly, simple, equation, could, have, generated, images, of, literally, infinite, complexity, clarke, also, notes, an, odd, coincidence, the, name, mandelbrot, and, the, word, mandala, for, a, religious, symbol, which, i, m, sure, is, a, pure, coincidence, but, indeed, the, mandelbrot, set, does, seem, to, contain, an, enormous, number, of, mandalas, in, 1982, mandelbrot, expanded, and, updated, his, ideas, in, the, fractal, geometry, of, nature, this, influential, work, brought, fractals, into, the, mainstream, of, professional, and, popular, mathematics, as, well, as, silencing, critics, who, had, dismissed, fractals, as, program, artifacts, mandelbrot, left, ibm, in, 1987, after, 35, years, and, 12, days, when, ibm, decided, to, end, pure, research, in, his, division, he, joined, the, department, of, mathematics, at, yale, and, obtained, his, first, tenured, post, in, 1999, at, the, age, of, 75, at, the, time, of, his, retirement, in, 2005, he, was, sterling, professor, of, mathematical, sciences, mandelbrot, created, the, first, ever, theory, of, roughness, and, he, saw, roughness, in, the, shapes, of, mountains, coastlines, and, river, basins, the, structures, of, plants, blood, vessels, and, lungs, the, clustering, of, galaxies, his, personal, quest, was, to, create, some, mathematical, formula, to, measure, the, overall, roughness, of, such, objects, in, nature, xi, he, began, by, asking, himself, various, kinds, of, questions, related, to, nature, can, geometry, deliver, what, the, greek, root, of, its, name, seemed, to, promise, truthful, measurement, not, only, of, cultivated, fields, along, the, nile, river, but, also, of, untamed, earth, xii, in, his, paper, how, long, is, the, coast, of, britain, statistical, self, similarity, and, fractional, dimension, published, in, science, in, 1967, mandelbrot, discusses, self, similar, curves, that, have, hausdorff, dimension, that, are, examples, of, fractals, although, mandelbrot, does, not, use, this, term, in, the, paper, as, he, did, not, coin, it, until, 1975, the, paper, is, one, of, mandelbrot, s, first, publications, on, the, topic, of, fractals, mandelbrot, emphasized, the, use, of, fractals, as, realistic, and, useful, models, for, describing, many, rough, phenomena, in, the, real, world, he, concluded, that, real, roughness, is, often, fractal, and, can, be, measured, 296, although, mandelbrot, coined, the, term, fractal, some, of, the, mathematical, objects, he, presented, in, the, fractal, geometry, of, nature, had, been, previously, described, by, other, mathematicians, before, mandelbrot, however, they, were, regarded, as, isolated, curiosities, with, unnatural, and, non, intuitive, properties, mandelbrot, brought, these, objects, together, for, the, first, time, and, turned, them, into, essential, tools, for, the, long, stalled, effort, to, extend, the, scope, of, science, to, explaining, non, smooth, rough, objects, in, the, real, world, his, methods, of, research, were, both, old, and, new, the, form, of, geometry, i, increasingly, favored, is, the, oldest, most, concrete, and, most, inclusive, specifically, empowered, by, the, eye, and, helped, by, the, hand, and, today, also, by, the, computer, bringing, an, element, of, unity, to, the, worlds, of, knowing, and, feeling, and, unwittingly, as, a, bonus, for, the, purpose, of, creating, beauty, 292, fractals, are, also, found, in, human, pursuits, such, as, music, painting, architecture, and, stock, market, prices, mandelbrot, believed, that, fractals, far, from, being, unnatural, were, in, many, ways, more, intuitive, and, natural, than, the, artificially, smooth, objects, of, traditional, euclidean, geometry, clouds, are, not, spheres, mountains, are, not, cones, coastlines, are, not, circles, and, bark, is, not, smooth, nor, does, lightning, travel, in, a, straight, line, mandelbrot, in, his, introduction, to, the, fractal, geometry, of, nature, mandelbrot, has, been, called, an, artist, and, a, visionary, and, a, maverick, his, informal, and, passionate, style, of, writing, and, his, emphasis, on, visual, and, geometric, intuition, supported, by, the, inclusion, of, numerous, illustrations, made, the, fractal, geometry, of, nature, accessible, to, non, specialists, the, book, sparked, widespread, popular, interest, in, fractals, and, contributed, to, chaos, theory, and, other, fields, of, science, and, mathematics, mandelbrot, also, put, his, ideas, to, work, in, cosmology, he, offered, in, 1974, a, new, explanation, of, olbers, paradox, the, dark, night, sky, riddle, demonstrating, the, consequences, of, fractal, theory, as, a, sufficient, but, not, necessary, resolution, of, the, paradox, he, postulated, that, if, the, stars, in, the, universe, were, fractally, distributed, for, example, like, cantor, dust, it, would, not, be, necessary, to, rely, on, the, big, bang, theory, to, explain, the, paradox, his, model, would, not, rule, out, a, big, bang, but, would, allow, for, a, dark, sky, even, if, the, big, bang, had, not, occurred, mandelbrot, s, awards, include, the, wolf, prize, for, physics, in, 1993, the, lewis, fry, richardson, prize, of, the, european, geophysical, society, in, 2000, the, japan, prize, in, 2003, and, the, einstein, lectureship, of, the, american, mathematical, society, in, 2006, the, small, asteroid, 27500, mandelbrot, was, named, in, his, honor, in, november, 1990, he, was, made, a, chevalier, in, france, s, legion, of, honour, in, december, 2005, mandelbrot, was, appointed, to, the, position, of, battelle, fellow, at, the, pacific, northwest, national, laboratory, mandelbrot, was, promoted, to, an, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, in, january, 2006, an, honorary, degree, from, johns, hopkins, university, was, bestowed, on, mandelbrot, in, the, may, 2010, commencement, exercises, a, partial, list, of, awards, received, by, mandelbrot, mandelbrot, died, from, pancreatic, cancer, at, the, age, of, 85, in, a, hospice, in, cambridge, massachusetts, on, 14, october, 2010, reacting, to, news, of, his, death, mathematician, heinz, otto, peitgen, said, f, we, talk, about, impact, inside, mathematics, and, applications, in, the, sciences, he, is, one, of, the, most, important, figures, of, the, last, fifty, years, chris, anderson, ted, conference, curator, described, mandelbrot, as, an, icon, who, changed, how, we, see, the, world, nicolas, sarkozy, president, of, france, at, the, time, of, mandelbrot, s, death, said, mandelbrot, had, a, powerful, original, mind, that, never, shied, away, from, innovating, and, shattering, preconceived, notions, is, work, developed, entirely, outside, mainstream, research, led, to, modern, information, theory, mandelbrot, s, obituary, in, the, economist, points, out, his, fame, as, celebrity, beyond, the, academy, and, lauds, him, as, the, father, of, fractal, geometry, best, selling, essayist, author, nassim, nicholas, taleb, has, remarked, that, mandelbrot, s, book, the, mis, behavior, of, markets, is, in, his, opinion, the, deepest, and, most, realistic, finance, book, ever, published
