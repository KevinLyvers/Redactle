and, encouraged, tourism, it, was, a, required, stop, on, the, grand, tour, traveled, by, young, men, coming, of, age, especially, those, belonging, to, the, british, aristocracy, the, famed, carnival, gambling, houses, and, beautiful, courtesans, were, powerful, drawcards, this, environment, provided, many, of, his, formative, experiences, his, grandmother, marzia, baldissera, cared, for, him, while, his, mother, toured, about, europe, in, the, theater, his, father, died, when, he, was, eight, as, a, child, casanova, suffered, nosebleeds, and, his, grandmother, sought, help, from, a, witch, leaving, the, gondola, we, enter, a, hovel, where, we, find, an, old, woman, sitting, on, a, pallet, with, a, black, cat, in, her, arms, and, five, or, six, others, around, her, though, the, unguent, applied, was, ineffective, casanova, was, fascinated, by, the, incantation, perhaps, to, remedy, the, nosebleeds, a, physician, blamed, the, density, of, venice, s, air, casanova, on, his, ninth, birthday, was, sent, to, a, boarding, house, on, the, mainland, in, padua, for, casanova, the, neglect, by, his, parents, was, a, bitter, memory, so, they, got, rid, of, me, he, proclaimed, conditions, at, the, boarding, house, were, appalling, so, he, appealed, to, be, placed, under, the, care, of, abb, gozzi, his, primary, instructor, who, tutored, him, in, academic, subjects, as, well, as, the, violin, casanova, moved, in, with, the, priest, and, his, family, and, lived, there, through, most, of, his, teenage, years, in, the, gozzi, household, casanova, first, came, into, contact, with, the, opposite, sex, when, gozzi, s, younger, sister, bettina, fondled, him, at, the, age, of, 11, bettina, was, pretty, lighthearted, and, a, great, reader, of, romances, the, girl, pleased, me, at, once, though, i, had, no, idea, why, it, was, she, who, little, by, little, kindled, in, my, heart, the, first, sparks, of, a, feeling, which, later, became, my, ruling, passion, although, she, subsequently, married, casanova, maintained, a, lifelong, attachment, to, bettina, and, the, gozzi, family, casanova, boasts, of, having, demonstrated, from, early, on, a, quick, wit, an, intense, appetite, for, knowledge, and, a, perpetually, inquisitive, mind, he, entered, the, university, of, padua, at, 12, and, graduated, at, 17, in, 1742, with, a, degree, in, law, for, which, i, felt, an, unconquerable, aversion, his, guardian, s, hope, was, that, he, would, become, an, ecclesiastical, lawyer, casanova, had, also, studied, moral, philosophy, chemistry, and, mathematics, and, was, keenly, interested, in, medicine, i, should, have, been, allowed, to, do, as, i, wished, and, become, a, physician, in, which, profession, quackery, is, even, more, effective, than, it, is, in, legal, practice, he, frequently, prescribed, his, own, treatments, for, himself, and, friends, while, attending, the, university, casanova, began, to, gamble, and, quickly, got, into, debt, causing, his, recall, to, venice, by, his, grandmother, but, the, gambling, habit, became, firmly, established, back, in, venice, casanova, started, his, clerical, law, career, and, was, admitted, as, an, abb, after, being, conferred, minor, orders, by, the, patriarch, of, venice, he, shuttled, back, and, forth, to, padua, to, continue, his, university, studies, by, now, he, had, become, something, of, a, dandy, tall, and, dark, his, long, hair, powdered, scented, and, elaborately, curled, he, quickly, ingratiated, himself, with, a, patron, something, he, was, to, do, all, his, life, 76, year, old, venetian, senator, alvise, gasparo, malipiero, the, owner, of, palazzo, malipiero, close, to, casanova, s, home, in, venice, malipiero, moved, in, the, best, circles, and, taught, young, casanova, a, great, deal, about, good, food, and, wine, and, how, to, behave, in, society, however, casanova, was, caught, dallying, with, malipiero, s, intended, object, of, seduction, actress, teresa, imer, and, the, senator, drove, both, of, them, from, his, house, casanova, s, growing, curiosity, about, women, led, to, his, first, complete, sexual, experience, with, two, sisters, nanetta, and, marton, savorgnan, then, 14, and, 16, who, were, distant, relatives, of, the, grimanis, casanova, proclaimed, that, his, life, avocation, was, firmly, established, by, this, encounter, scandals, tainted, casanova, s, short, church, career, after, his, grandmother, s, death, casanova, entered, a, seminary, for, a, short, while, but, soon, his, indebtedness, landed, him, in, prison, for, the, first, time, an, attempt, by, his, mother, to, secure, him, a, position, with, bishop, bernardo, de, bernardis, was, rejected, by, casanova, after, a, very, brief, trial, of, conditions, in, the, bishop, s, calabrian, see, instead, he, found, employment, as, a, scribe, with, the, powerful, cardinal, acquaviva, in, rome, on, meeting, pope, benedict, xiv, casanova, boldly, asked, for, a, dispensation, to, read, the, forbidden, books, and, from, eating, fish, which, he, claimed, inflamed, his, eyes, he, also, composed, love, letters, for, another, cardinal, when, casanova, became, the, scapegoat, for, a, scandal, involving, a, local, pair, of, star, crossed, lovers, cardinal, acquaviva, dismissed, casanova, thanking, him, for, his, sacrifice, but, effectively, ending, his, church, career, in, search, of, a, new, profession, casanova, bought, a, commission, to, become, a, military, officer, for, the, republic, of, venice, his, first, step, was, to, look, the, part, reflecting, that, there, was, now, little, likelihood, of, my, achieving, fortune, in, my, ecclesiastical, career, i, decided, to, dress, as, a, soldier, i, inquire, for, a, good, tailor, he, brings, me, everything, i, need, to, impersonate, a, follower, of, mars, my, uniform, was, white, with, a, blue, vest, a, shoulder, knot, of, silver, and, gold, i, bought, a, long, sword, and, with, my, handsome, cane, in, hand, a, trim, hat, with, a, black, cockade, with, my, hair, cut, in, side, whiskers, and, a, long, false, pigtail, i, set, forth, to, impress, the, whole, city, he, joined, a, venetian, regiment, at, corfu, his, stay, being, broken, by, a, brief, trip, to, constantinople, ostensibly, to, deliver, a, letter, from, his, former, master, the, cardinal, finding, his, advancement, too, slow, and, his, duty, boring, he, managed, to, lose, most, of, his, pay, playing, faro, casanova, soon, abandoned, his, military, career, and, returned, to, venice, at, the, age, of, 21, he, set, out, to, become, a, professional, gambler, but, losing, all, the, money, remaining, from, the, sale, of, his, commission, he, turned, to, his, old, benefactor, alvise, grimani, for, a, job, casanova, thus, began, his, third, career, as, a, violinist, in, the, san, samuele, theater, a, menial, journeyman, of, a, sublime, art, in, which, if, he, who, excels, is, admired, the, mediocrity, is, rightly, despised, my, profession, was, not, a, noble, one, but, i, did, not, care, calling, everything, prejudice, i, soon, acquired, all, the, habits, of, my, degraded, fellow, musicians, he, and, some, of, his, fellows, often, spent, our, nights, roaming, through, different, quarters, of, the, city, thinking, up, the, most, scandalous, practical, jokes, and, putting, them, into, execution, we, amused, ourselves, by, untying, the, gondolas, moored, before, private, homes, which, then, drifted, with, the, current, they, also, sent, midwives, and, physicians, on, false, calls, good, fortune, came, to, the, rescue, when, casanova, unhappy, with, his, lot, as, a, musician, saved, the, life, of, a, venetian, patrician, of, the, bragadin, family, who, had, a, stroke, while, riding, with, casanova, in, a, gondola, after, a, wedding, ball, they, immediately, stopped, to, have, the, senator, bled, then, at, the, senator, s, palace, a, physician, bled, the, senator, again, and, applied, an, ointment, of, mercury, an, all, purpose, but, toxic, remedy, at, the, time, to, the, senator, s, chest, this, raised, his, temperature, and, induced, a, massive, fever, and, bragadin, appeared, to, be, choking, on, his, own, swollen, windpipe, a, priest, was, called, as, death, seemed, to, be, approaching, however, despite, protests, from, the, attending, physician, casanova, ordered, the, removal, of, the, ointment, and, the, washing, of, the, senator, s, chest, with, cool, water, the, senator, recovered, from, his, illness, with, rest, and, a, sensible, diet, because, of, his, youth, and, his, facile, recitation, of, medical, knowledge, the, senator, and, his, two, bachelor, friends, thought, casanova, wise, beyond, his, years, and, concluded, that, he, must, be, in, possession, of, occult, knowledge, as, they, were, cabalists, themselves, the, senator, invited, casanova, into, his, household, and, became, a, lifelong, patron, casanova, stated, in, his, memoirs, i, took, the, most, creditable, the, noblest, and, the, only, natural, course, i, decided, to, put, myself, in, a, position, where, i, need, no, longer, go, without, the, necessities, of, life, and, what, those, necessities, were, for, me, no, one, could, judge, better, than, me, no, one, in, venice, could, understand, how, an, intimacy, could, exist, between, myself, and, three, men, of, their, character, they, all, heaven, and, i, all, earth, they, most, severe, in, their, morals, and, i, addicted, to, every, kind, of, dissolute, living, for, the, next, three, years, under, the, senator, s, patronage, working, nominally, as, a, legal, assistant, casanova, led, the, life, of, a, nobleman, dressing, magnificently, and, as, was, natural, to, him, spending, most, of, his, time, gambling, and, engaging, in, amorous, pursuits, his, patron, was, exceedingly, tolerant, but, he, warned, casanova, that, some, day, he, would, pay, the, price, i, made, a, joke, of, his, dire, prophecies, and, went, my, way, however, not, much, later, casanova, was, forced, to, leave, venice, due, to, further, scandals, casanova, had, dug, up, a, freshly, buried, corpse, to, play, a, practical, joke, on, an, enemy, and, exact, revenge, but, the, victim, went, into, a, paralysis, never, to, recover, in, another, scandal, a, young, girl, who, had, duped, him, accused, him, of, rape, and, went, to, the, officials, casanova, was, later, acquitted, of, this, crime, for, lack, of, evidence, but, by, this, time, he, had, already, fled, from, venice, escaping, to, parma, casanova, entered, into, a, three, month, affair, with, a, frenchwoman, he, named, henriette, perhaps, the, deepest, love, he, ever, experienced, a, woman, who, combined, beauty, intelligence, and, culture, in, his, words, they, who, believe, that, a, woman, is, incapable, of, making, a, man, equally, happy, all, the, twenty, four, hours, of, the, day, have, never, known, an, henriette, the, joy, which, flooded, my, soul, was, far, greater, when, i, conversed, with, her, during, the, day, than, when, i, held, her, in, my, arms, at, night, having, read, a, great, deal, and, having, natural, taste, henriette, judged, rightly, of, everything, she, also, judged, casanova, astutely, as, noted, casanovist, j, rives, childs, wrote, perhaps, no, woman, so, captivated, casanova, as, henriette, few, women, obtained, so, deep, an, understanding, of, him, she, penetrated, his, outward, shell, early, in, their, relationship, resisting, the, temptation, to, unite, her, destiny, with, his, she, came, to, discern, his, volatile, nature, his, lack, of, social, background, and, the, precariousness, of, his, finances, before, leaving, she, slipped, into, his, pocket, five, hundred, louis, mark, of, her, evaluation, of, him, crestfallen, and, despondent, casanova, returned, to, venice, and, after, a, good, gambling, streak, he, recovered, and, set, off, on, a, grand, tour, reaching, paris, in, 1750, along, the, way, from, one, town, to, another, he, got, into, sexual, escapades, resembling, operatic, plots, in, lyon, he, entered, the, society, of, freemasonry, which, appealed, to, his, interest, in, secret, rites, and, which, for, the, most, part, attracted, men, of, intellect, and, influence, who, proved, useful, in, his, life, providing, valuable, contacts, and, uncensored, knowledge, casanova, was, also, attracted, to, rosicrucianism, in, lyons, casanova, became, companion, and, finally, took, the, highest, degree, of, scottish, rite, master, mason, regarding, his, initiation, to, the, scottish, rite, freemasonry, in, lyon, the, memoirs, said, it, was, in, lyons, that, a, respectable, individual, whose, acquaintance, i, made, at, the, house, of, m, de, rochebaron, obtained, for, me, the, favour, of, being, initiated, in, the, sublime, trifles, of, freemasonry, i, arrived, in, paris, a, simple, apprentice, a, few, months, after, my, arrival, i, became, companion, and, master, the, last, is, certainly, the, highest, degree, in, freemasonry, for, all, the, other, degrees, which, i, took, afterwards, are, only, pleasing, inventions, which, although, symbolical, add, nothing, to, the, dignity, of, master, casanova, stayed, in, paris, for, two, years, learned, the, language, spent, much, time, at, the, theater, and, introduced, himself, to, notables, soon, however, his, numerous, liaisons, were, noted, by, the, paris, police, as, they, were, in, nearly, every, city, he, visited, in, 1752, his, brother, francesco, and, he, moved, from, paris, to, dresden, where, his, mother, and, sister, maria, maddalena, were, living, his, new, play, la, moluccheide, now, lost, was, performed, at, the, royal, theatre, where, his, mother, often, played, in, lead, roles, he, then, visited, prague, and, vienna, where, the, tighter, moral, atmosphere, was, not, to, his, liking, he, finally, returned, to, venice, in, 1753, there, casanova, resumed, his, escapades, picking, up, many, enemies, and, gaining, the, scrutiny, of, the, venetian, inquisitors, his, police, record, became, a, lengthening, list, of, reported, blasphemies, seductions, fights, and, public, controversy, a, state, spy, giovanni, manucci, was, employed, to, draw, out, casanova, s, knowledge, of, cabalism, and, freemasonry, and, to, examine, his, library, for, forbidden, books, senator, bragadin, in, total, seriousness, this, time, being, a, former, inquisitor, himself, advised, his, son, to, leave, immediately, or, face, the, stiffest, consequences, on, 26, july, 1755, at, age, 30, casanova, was, arrested, for, affront, to, religion, and, common, decency, the, tribunal, having, taken, cognizance, of, the, grave, faults, committed, by, g, casanova, primarily, in, public, outrages, against, the, holy, religion, their, excellencies, have, caused, him, to, be, arrested, and, imprisoned, under, the, leads, the, leads, was, a, prison, of, seven, cells, on, the, top, floor, of, the, east, wing, of, the, doge, s, palace, reserved, for, prisoners, of, higher, status, as, well, as, certain, types, of, offenders, such, as, political, prisoners, defrocked, or, libertine, priests, or, monks, and, usurers, and, named, for, the, lead, plates, covering, the, palace, roof, the, following, 12, september, without, a, trial, and, without, being, informed, of, the, reasons, for, his, arrest, and, of, the, sentence, he, was, sentenced, to, five, years, imprisonment, he, was, placed, in, a, single, person, room, with, clothing, a, pallet, bed, table, and, armchair, in, the, worst, of, all, the, cells, where, he, suffered, greatly, from, the, darkness, summer, heat, and, millions, of, fleas, he, was, later, housed, with, a, series, of, cellmates, after, five, months, and, a, personal, appeal, from, count, bragadin, he, was, given, warm, winter, bedding, and, a, monthly, stipend, for, books, and, better, food, during, exercise, walks, he, was, granted, in, the, prison, garret, he, found, a, piece, of, black, marble, and, an, iron, bar, which, he, smuggled, back, to, his, cell, he, hid, the, bar, inside, his, armchair, when, he, was, temporarily, without, cellmates, he, spent, two, weeks, sharpening, the, bar, into, a, spike, on, the, stone, then, he, began, to, gouge, through, the, wooden, floor, underneath, his, bed, knowing, that, his, cell, was, directly, above, the, inquisitor, s, chamber, just, three, days, before, his, intended, escape, during, a, festival, when, no, officials, would, be, in, the, chamber, below, casanova, was, moved, to, a, larger, lighter, cell, with, a, view, despite, his, protests, that, he, was, perfectly, happy, where, he, was, in, his, new, cell, i, sat, in, my, armchair, like, a, man, in, a, stupor, motionless, as, a, statue, i, saw, that, i, had, wasted, all, the, efforts, i, had, made, and, i, could, not, repent, of, them, i, felt, that, i, had, nothing, to, hope, for, and, the, only, relief, left, to, me, was, not, to, think, of, the, future, casanova, set, upon, another, escape, plan, he, solicited, the, help, of, the, prisoner, in, the, adjacent, cell, father, balbi, a, renegade, priest, the, spike, carried, to, the, new, cell, inside, the, armchair, was, passed, to, the, priest, in, a, folio, bible, carried, under, a, heaping, plate, of, pasta, by, the, hoodwinked, jailer, the, priest, made, a, hole, in, his, ceiling, climbed, across, and, made, a, hole, in, the, ceiling, of, casanova, s, cell, to, neutralize, his, new, cellmate, who, was, a, spy, casanova, played, on, his, superstitions, and, terrorized, him, into, silence, when, balbi, broke, through, to, casanova, s, cell, casanova, lifted, himself, through, the, ceiling, leaving, behind, a, note, that, quoted, the, 117th, psalm, from, the, latin, vulgate, i, shall, not, die, but, live, and, declare, the, works, of, the, lord, the, spy, remained, behind, too, frightened, of, the, consequences, if, he, were, caught, escaping, with, the, others, casanova, and, balbi, pried, their, way, through, the, lead, plates, and, onto, the, sloping, roof, of, the, doge, s, palace, with, a, heavy, fog, swirling, the, drop, to, the, nearby, canal, being, too, great, casanova, prised, open, the, grate, over, a, dormer, window, and, broke, the, window, to, gain, entry, they, found, a, long, ladder, on, the, roof, and, with, the, additional, use, of, a, bedsheet, rope, that, casanova, had, prepared, lowered, themselves, into, the, room, whose, floor, was, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, below, they, rested, until, morning, changed, clothes, then, broke, a, small, lock, on, an, exit, door, and, passed, into, a, palace, corridor, through, galleries, and, chambers, and, down, stairs, where, by, convincing, the, guard, they, had, inadvertently, been, locked, into, the, palace, after, an, official, function, they, left, through, a, final, door, it, was, 6, 00, in, the, morning, and, they, escaped, by, gondola, eventually, casanova, reached, paris, where, he, arrived, on, the, same, day, 5, january, 1757, that, robert, fran, ois, damiens, made, an, attempt, on, the, life, of, louis, xv, casanova, would, later, witness, and, describe, his, execution, thirty, years, later, in, 1787, casanova, wrote, story, of, my, flight, which, was, very, popular, and, was, reprinted, in, many, languages, and, he, repeated, the, tale, a, little, later, in, his, memoirs, casanova, s, judgment, of, the, exploit, is, characteristic, thus, did, god, provide, me, with, what, i, needed, for, an, escape, which, was, to, be, a, wonder, if, not, a, miracle, i, admit, that, i, am, proud, of, it, but, my, pride, does, not, come, from, my, having, succeeded, for, luck, had, a, good, deal, to, do, with, that, it, comes, from, my, having, concluded, that, the, thing, could, be, done, and, having, had, the, courage, to, undertake, it, he, knew, his, stay, in, paris, might, be, a, long, one, and, he, proceeded, accordingly, i, saw, that, to, accomplish, anything, i, must, bring, all, my, physical, and, moral, faculties, in, play, make, the, acquaintance, of, the, great, and, the, powerful, exercise, strict, self, control, and, play, the, chameleon, casanova, had, matured, and, this, time, in, paris, though, still, depending, at, times, on, quick, thinking, and, decisive, action, he, was, more, calculating, and, deliberate, his, first, task, was, to, find, a, new, patron, he, reconnected, with, his, old, friend, de, bernis, now, the, foreign, minister, of, france, casanova, was, advised, by, his, patron, to, find, a, means, of, raising, funds, for, the, state, as, a, way, to, gain, instant, favor, casanova, promptly, became, one, of, the, trustees, of, the, first, state, lottery, and, one, of, its, best, ticket, salesmen, the, enterprise, earned, him, a, large, fortune, quickly, with, money, in, hand, he, traveled, in, high, circles, and, undertook, new, seductions, he, duped, many, socialites, with, his, occultism, particularly, the, marquise, jeanne, d, urf, using, his, excellent, memory, which, made, him, appear, to, have, a, sorcerer, s, power, of, numerology, in, casanova, s, view, deceiving, a, fool, is, an, exploit, worthy, of, an, intelligent, man, casanova, claimed, to, be, a, rosicrucian, and, an, alchemist, aptitudes, which, made, him, popular, with, some, of, the, most, prominent, figures, of, the, era, among, them, madame, de, pompadour, the, count, of, saint, germain, d, alembert, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, so, popular, was, alchemy, among, the, nobles, particularly, the, search, for, the, philosopher, s, stone, that, casanova, was, highly, sought, after, for, his, supposed, knowledge, and, he, profited, handsomely, he, met, his, match, however, in, the, count, of, saint, germain, this, very, singular, man, born, to, be, the, most, barefaced, of, all, imposters, declared, with, impunity, with, a, casual, air, that, he, was, three, hundred, years, old, that, he, possessed, the, universal, medicine, that, he, made, anything, he, liked, from, nature, that, he, created, diamonds, de, bernis, decided, to, send, casanova, to, dunkirk, on, his, first, spying, mission, casanova, was, paid, well, for, his, quick, work, and, this, experience, prompted, one, of, his, few, remarks, against, the, ancien, r, gime, and, the, class, on, which, he, was, dependent, he, remarked, in, hindsight, all, the, french, ministers, are, the, same, they, lavished, money, which, came, out, of, the, other, people, s, pockets, to, enrich, their, creatures, and, they, were, absolute, the, down, trodden, people, counted, for, nothing, and, through, this, the, indebtedness, of, the, state, and, the, confusion, of, finances, were, the, inevitable, results, a, revolution, was, necessary, as, the, seven, years, war, began, casanova, was, again, called, to, help, increase, the, state, treasury, he, was, entrusted, with, a, mission, of, selling, state, bonds, in, amsterdam, the, netherlands, being, the, financial, center, of, europe, at, the, time, he, succeeded, in, selling, the, bonds, at, only, an, 8, discount, and, the, following, year, was, rich, enough, to, found, a, silk, manufactory, with, his, earnings, the, french, government, even, offered, him, a, title, and, a, pension, if, he, would, become, a, french, citizen, and, work, on, behalf, of, the, finance, ministry, but, he, declined, perhaps, because, it, would, frustrate, his, wanderlust, casanova, had, reached, his, peak, of, fortune, but, could, not, sustain, it, he, ran, the, business, poorly, borrowed, heavily, trying, to, save, it, and, spent, much, of, his, wealth, on, constant, liaisons, with, his, female, workers, who, were, his, harem, for, his, debts, casanova, was, imprisoned, again, this, time, at, for, l, v, que, but, was, liberated, four, days, afterwards, upon, the, insistence, of, the, marquise, d, urf, unfortunately, though, he, was, released, his, patron, de, bernis, was, dismissed, by, louis, xv, at, that, time, and, casanova, s, enemies, closed, in, on, him, he, sold, the, rest, of, his, belongings, and, secured, another, mission, to, holland, to, distance, himself, from, his, troubles, this, time, however, his, mission, failed, and, he, fled, to, cologne, then, stuttgart, in, the, spring, of, 1760, where, he, lost, the, rest, of, his, fortune, he, was, yet, again, arrested, for, his, debts, but, managed, to, escape, to, switzerland, weary, of, his, wanton, life, casanova, visited, the, monastery, of, einsiedeln, and, considered, the, simple, scholarly, life, of, a, monk, he, returned, to, his, hotel, to, think, on, the, decision, only, to, encounter, a, new, object, of, desire, and, reverting, to, his, old, instincts, all, thoughts, of, a, monk, s, life, were, quickly, forgotten, moving, on, he, visited, albrecht, von, haller, and, voltaire, and, arrived, in, marseille, then, genoa, florence, rome, naples, modena, and, turin, moving, from, one, sexual, romp, to, another, in, 1760, casanova, started, styling, himself, the, chevalier, de, seingalt, a, name, he, was, to, use, increasingly, for, the, rest, of, his, life, on, occasion, he, would, also, call, himself, count, de, farussi, using, his, mother, s, maiden, name, and, when, pope, clement, xiii, presented, casanova, with, the, papal, order, of, the, golden, spur, he, had, an, impressive, cross, and, ribbon, to, display, on, his, chest, back, in, paris, he, set, about, one, of, his, most, outrageous, schemes, convincing, his, old, dupe, the, marquise, d, urf, that, he, could, turn, her, into, a, young, man, through, occult, means, the, plan, did, not, yield, casanova, the, big, payoff, he, had, hoped, for, and, the, marquise, d, urf, finally, lost, faith, in, him, casanova, traveled, to, england, in, 1763, hoping, to, sell, his, idea, of, a, state, lottery, to, british, officials, he, wrote, of, the, english, the, people, have, a, special, character, common, to, the, whole, nation, which, makes, them, think, they, are, superior, to, everyone, else, it, is, a, belief, shared, by, all, nations, each, thinking, itself, the, best, and, they, are, all, right, through, his, connections, he, worked, his, way, up, to, an, audience, with, george, iii, using, most, of, the, valuables, he, had, stolen, from, the, marquise, d, urf, while, working, the, political, angles, he, also, spent, much, time, in, the, bedroom, as, was, his, habit, as, a, means, to, find, females, for, his, pleasure, not, being, able, to, speak, english, he, put, an, advertisement, in, the, newspaper, to, let, an, apartment, to, the, right, person, he, interviewed, many, young, women, choosing, one, mistress, pauline, who, suited, him, well, soon, he, established, himself, in, her, apartment, and, seduced, her, these, and, other, liaisons, however, left, him, weak, with, venereal, disease, and, he, left, england, impoverished, and, ill, he, went, on, to, the, austrian, netherlands, recovered, and, then, for, the, next, three, years, traveled, all, over, europe, covering, about, 4, 500, miles, 7, 200, km, by, coach, over, rough, roads, and, going, as, far, as, moscow, and, saint, petersburg, the, average, daily, coach, trip, being, about, 30, miles, 48, km, again, his, principal, goal, was, to, sell, his, lottery, scheme, to, other, governments, and, repeat, the, great, success, he, had, with, the, french, government, but, a, meeting, with, frederick, the, great, bore, no, fruit, and, in, the, surrounding, german, lands, the, same, result, lacking, neither, connections, nor, confidence, casanova, went, to, russia, and, met, with, catherine, the, great, but, she, flatly, turned, down, the, lottery, idea, in, 1766, he, was, expelled, from, warsaw, following, a, pistol, duel, with, colonel, franciszek, ksawery, branicki, over, an, italian, actress, a, lady, friend, of, theirs, both, duelists, were, wounded, casanova, on, the, left, hand, the, hand, recovered, on, its, own, after, casanova, refused, the, recommendation, of, doctors, that, it, be, amputated, from, warsaw, he, traveled, to, breslau, in, the, kingdom, of, prussia, then, to, dresden, where, he, contracted, yet, another, venereal, infection, he, returned, to, paris, for, several, months, in, 1767, and, hit, the, gambling, salons, only, to, be, expelled, from, france, by, order, of, louis, xv, himself, primarily, for, casanova, s, scam, involving, the, marquise, d, urf, now, known, across, europe, for, his, reckless, behavior, casanova, would, have, difficulty, overcoming, his, notoriety, and, gaining, any, fortune, so, he, headed, for, spain, where, he, was, not, as, notorious, he, tried, his, usual, approach, leaning, on, well, placed, contacts, often, freemasons, wining, and, dining, with, nobles, of, influence, and, finally, arranging, an, audience, with, the, local, monarch, in, this, case, charles, iii, when, no, doors, opened, for, him, however, he, could, only, roam, across, spain, with, little, to, show, for, it, in, barcelona, he, escaped, assassination, and, landed, in, jail, for, 6, weeks, his, spanish, adventure, a, failure, he, returned, to, france, briefly, then, to, italy, in, rome, casanova, had, to, prepare, a, way, for, his, return, to, venice, while, waiting, for, supporters, to, gain, him, legal, entry, into, venice, casanova, began, his, modern, tuscan, italian, translation, of, the, iliad, his, history, of, the, troubles, in, poland, and, a, comic, play, to, ingratiate, himself, with, the, venetian, authorities, casanova, did, some, commercial, spying, for, them, after, months, without, a, recall, however, he, wrote, a, letter, of, appeal, directly, to, the, inquisitors, at, last, he, received, his, long, sought, permission, and, burst, into, tears, upon, reading, we, inquisitors, of, state, for, reasons, known, to, us, give, giacomo, casanova, a, free, safe, conduct, empowering, him, to, come, go, stop, and, return, hold, communication, wheresoever, he, pleases, without, let, or, hindrance, so, is, our, will, casanova, was, permitted, to, return, to, venice, in, september, 1774, after, 18, years, of, exile, at, first, his, return, to, venice, was, a, cordial, one, and, he, was, a, celebrity, even, the, inquisitors, wanted, to, hear, how, he, had, escaped, from, their, prison, of, his, three, bachelor, patrons, however, only, dandolo, was, still, alive, and, casanova, was, invited, back, to, live, with, him, he, received, a, small, stipend, from, dandolo, and, hoped, to, live, from, his, writings, but, that, was, not, enough, he, reluctantly, became, a, correspondent, again, for, venice, paid, by, piece, work, reporting, on, religion, morals, and, commerce, most, of, it, based, on, gossip, and, rumor, he, picked, up, from, social, contacts, he, was, disappointed, no, financial, opportunities, of, interest, came, about, and, few, doors, opened, for, him, in, society, as, in, the, past, at, age, 49, the, years, of, reckless, living, and, the, thousands, of, miles, of, travel, had, taken, their, toll, casanova, s, smallpox, scars, sunken, cheeks, and, hook, nose, became, all, the, more, noticeable, his, easygoing, manner, was, now, more, guarded, prince, charles, de, ligne, a, friend, and, uncle, of, his, future, employer, described, him, around, 1784, he, would, be, a, good, looking, man, if, he, were, not, ugly, he, is, tall, and, built, like, hercules, but, of, an, african, tint, eyes, full, of, life, and, fire, but, touchy, wary, rancorous, and, this, gives, him, a, ferocious, air, it, is, easier, to, put, him, in, a, rage, than, to, make, him, gay, he, laughs, little, but, makes, others, laugh, he, has, a, manner, of, saying, things, which, reminds, me, of, harlequin, or, figaro, and, which, makes, them, sound, witty, venice, had, changed, for, him, casanova, now, had, little, money, for, gambling, few, willing, females, worth, pursuing, and, few, acquaintances, to, enliven, his, craven, impulsive, tendencies, he, heard, of, the, death, of, his, mother, and, more, paining, visited, the, deathbed, of, bettina, gozzi, who, had, first, introduced, him, to, sex, and, who, died, in, his, arms, his, iliad, was, published, in, three, volumes, but, to, limited, subscribers, and, yielding, little, money, he, got, into, a, published, dispute, with, voltaire, over, religion, when, he, asked, suppose, that, you, succeed, in, destroying, superstition, with, what, will, you, replace, it, voltaire, shot, back, i, like, that, when, i, deliver, humanity, from, a, ferocious, beast, which, devours, it, can, i, be, asked, what, i, shall, put, in, its, place, from, casanova, s, point, of, view, if, voltaire, had, been, a, proper, philosopher, he, would, have, kept, silent, on, that, subject, the, people, need, to, live, in, ignorance, for, the, general, peace, of, the, nation, in, 1779, casanova, found, francesca, an, uneducated, seamstress, who, became, his, live, in, lover, and, housekeeper, and, who, loved, him, devotedly, later, that, year, the, inquisitors, put, him, on, the, payroll, and, sent, him, to, investigate, commerce, between, the, papal, states, and, venice, other, publishing, and, theater, ventures, failed, primarily, from, lack, of, capital, in, a, downward, spiral, casanova, was, expelled, again, from, venice, in, 1783, after, writing, a, vicious, satire, poking, fun, at, venetian, nobility, in, it, he, made, his, only, public, statement, that, grimani, was, his, true, father, forced, to, resume, his, travels, again, casanova, arrived, in, paris, and, in, november, 1783, met, benjamin, franklin, while, attending, a, presentation, on, aeronautics, and, the, future, of, balloon, transport, for, a, while, casanova, served, as, secretary, and, pamphleteer, to, sebastian, foscarini, venetian, ambassador, in, vienna, he, also, became, acquainted, with, lorenzo, da, ponte, mozart, s, librettist, who, noted, about, casanova, this, singular, man, never, liked, to, be, in, the, wrong, notes, by, casanova, indicate, that, he, may, have, made, suggestions, to, da, ponte, concerning, the, libretto, for, mozart, s, don, giovanni, in, 1785, after, foscarini, died, casanova, began, searching, for, another, position, a, few, months, later, he, became, the, librarian, to, count, joseph, karl, von, waldstein, a, chamberlain, of, the, emperor, in, the, castle, of, dux, bohemia, now, the, czech, republic, the, count, himself, a, freemason, cabalist, and, frequent, traveler, had, taken, to, casanova, when, they, had, met, a, year, earlier, at, foscarini, s, residence, although, the, job, offered, security, and, good, pay, casanova, describes, his, last, years, as, boring, and, frustrating, though, it, was, a, productive, time, for, him, in, writing, his, health, had, deteriorated, dramatically, and, he, found, life, among, peasants, to, be, less, than, stimulating, he, was, only, able, to, make, occasional, visits, to, vienna, and, dresden, for, relief, although, casanova, got, on, well, with, the, count, his, employer, was, a, much, younger, man, with, his, own, eccentricities, the, count, often, ignored, him, at, meals, and, failed, to, introduce, him, to, important, visiting, guests, moreover, casanova, the, testy, outsider, was, thoroughly, disliked, by, most, of, the, other, inhabitants, of, the, castle, of, dux, casanova, s, only, friends, seemed, to, be, his, fox, terriers, in, despair, casanova, considered, suicide, but, instead, decided, that, he, must, live, on, to, record, his, memoirs, which, he, did, until, his, death, he, visited, prague, the, capital, city, and, principal, cultural, center, of, bohemia, on, many, occasions, in, october, 1787, he, met, lorenzo, da, ponte, the, librettist, of, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, s, opera, don, giovanni, in, prague, at, the, time, of, the, opera, s, first, production, and, likely, met, the, composer, as, well, at, the, same, time, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, he, was, also, in, prague, in, 1791, for, the, coronation, of, holy, roman, emperor, leopold, ii, as, king, of, bohemia, an, event, that, included, the, first, production, of, mozart, s, opera, la, clemenza, di, tito, casanova, is, known, to, have, drafted, dialogue, suitable, for, a, don, juan, drama, at, the, time, of, his, visit, to, prague, in, 1787, but, none, of, his, verses, were, ever, incorporated, into, mozart, s, don, giovanni, in, 1797, word, arrived, that, the, republic, of, venice, had, ceased, to, exist, and, that, napoleon, bonaparte, had, seized, casanova, s, home, city, it, was, too, late, to, return, home, casanova, died, on, 4, june, 1798, at, the, age, of, 73, his, last, words, are, said, to, have, been, i, have, lived, as, a, philosopher, and, i, die, as, a, christian, casanova, was, buried, at, dux, nowadays, duchcov, in, the, czech, republic, but, the, location, of, his, grave, has, been, forgotten, the, isolation, and, boredom, of, casanova, s, last, years, enabled, him, to, focus, without, distractions, on, his, histoire, de, ma, vie, without, which, his, memory, would, have, been, considerably, diminished, if, not, blotted, out, entirely, he, began, to, think, about, writing, his, memoirs, around, 1780, and, began, in, earnest, by, 1789, as, the, only, remedy, to, keep, from, going, mad, or, dying, of, grief, the, first, draft, was, completed, by, july, 1792, and, he, spent, the, next, six, years, revising, it, he, puts, a, happy, face, on, his, days, of, loneliness, writing, in, his, work, i, can, find, no, pleasanter, pastime, than, to, converse, with, myself, about, my, own, affairs, and, to, provide, a, most, worthy, subject, for, laughter, to, my, well, bred, audience, his, memoirs, were, still, being, compiled, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, account, having, reached, only, the, summer, of, 1774, a, letter, by, him, in, 1792, states, that, he, was, reconsidering, his, decision, to, publish, them, believing, that, his, story, was, despicable, and, he, would, make, enemies, by, writing, the, truth, about, his, affairs, but, he, decided, to, proceed, using, initials, instead, of, actual, names, and, toning, down, the, strongest, passages, he, wrote, in, french, instead, of, italian, because, the, french, language, is, more, widely, known, than, mine, the, memoirs, open, with, i, begin, by, declaring, to, my, reader, that, by, everything, good, or, bad, that, i, have, done, throughout, my, life, i, am, sure, that, i, have, earned, merit, or, incurred, guilt, and, that, hence, i, must, consider, myself, a, free, agent, despite, an, excellent, moral, foundation, the, inevitable, fruit, of, the, divine, principles, which, were, rooted, in, my, heart, i, was, all, my, life, the, victim, of, my, senses, i, have, delighted, in, going, astray, and, i, have, constantly, lived, in, error, with, no, other, consolation, than, that, of, knowing, i, have, erred, my, follies, are, the, follies, of, youth, you, will, see, that, i, laugh, at, them, and, if, you, are, kind, you, will, laugh, at, them, with, me, casanova, wrote, about, the, purpose, of, his, book, i, expect, the, friendship, the, esteem, and, the, gratitude, of, my, readers, their, gratitude, if, reading, my, memoirs, will, have, given, instruction, and, pleasure, their, esteem, if, doing, me, justice, they, will, have, found, that, i, have, more, virtues, than, faults, and, their, friendship, as, soon, as, they, come, to, find, me, deserving, of, it, by, the, frankness, and, good, faith, with, which, i, submit, myself, to, their, judgment, without, in, any, way, disguising, what, i, am, he, also, advises, his, readers, that, they, will, not, find, all, my, adventures, i, have, left, out, those, which, would, have, offended, the, people, who, played, a, part, in, them, for, they, would, cut, a, sorry, figure, in, them, even, so, there, are, those, who, will, sometimes, think, me, too, indiscreet, i, am, sorry, for, it, in, the, final, chapter, the, text, abruptly, breaks, off, with, hints, at, adventures, unrecorded, three, years, later, i, saw, her, in, padua, where, i, resumed, my, acquaintance, with, her, daughter, on, far, more, tender, terms, in, their, original, publication, the, memoirs, were, divided, into, twelve, volumes, and, the, unabridged, english, translation, by, willard, r, trask, runs, to, more, than, 3, 500, pages, though, his, chronology, is, at, times, confusing, and, inaccurate, and, many, of, his, tales, exaggerated, much, of, his, narrative, and, many, details, are, corroborated, by, contemporary, writings, he, has, a, good, ear, for, dialogue, and, writes, at, length, about, all, classes, of, society, casanova, for, the, most, part, is, candid, about, his, faults, intentions, and, motivations, and, shares, his, successes, and, failures, with, good, humor, the, confession, is, largely, devoid, of, repentance, or, remorse, he, celebrates, the, senses, with, his, readers, especially, regarding, music, food, and, women, i, have, always, liked, highly, seasoned, food, as, for, women, i, have, always, found, that, the, one, i, was, in, love, with, smelled, good, and, the, more, copious, her, sweat, the, sweeter, i, found, it, he, mentions, over, 120, sexual, romantic, escapades, with, women, and, girls, with, several, veiled, references, to, male, lovers, as, well, he, describes, his, duels, and, conflicts, with, scoundrels, and, officials, his, entrapments, and, his, escapes, his, schemes, and, plots, his, anguish, and, his, sighs, of, pleasure, he, demonstrates, convincingly, i, can, say, vixi, i, have, lived, the, manuscript, of, casanova, s, memoirs, was, held, by, his, relatives, until, it, was, sold, to, f, a, brockhaus, publishers, and, first, published, in, heavily, abridged, versions, in, german, around, 1822, then, in, french, during, world, war, ii, the, manuscript, survived, the, allied, bombing, of, leipzig, the, memoirs, were, heavily, pirated, through, the, ages, and, have, been, translated, into, some, twenty, languages, not, until, 1960, was, the, entire, text, published, in, its, original, language, of, french, in, 2010, the, manuscript, was, acquired, by, the, national, library, of, france, which, has, started, digitizing, it, for, casanova, as, well, as, his, local, contemporaries, of, the, upper, class, love, and, sex, tended, to, be, casual, and, not, endowed, with, the, solemnity, characteristic, of, other, romantic, literary, works, of, the, 19th, century, flirtations, bedroom, games, and, short, term, liaisons, were, common, among, nobles, who, married, for, social, connections, rather, than, love, multi, faceted, and, complex, casanova, s, personality, as, he, described, it, was, dominated, by, his, sensual, urges, cultivating, whatever, gave, pleasure, to, my, senses, was, always, the, chief, business, of, my, life, i, never, found, any, occupation, more, important, feeling, that, i, was, born, for, the, sex, opposite, of, mine, i, have, always, loved, it, and, done, all, that, i, could, to, make, myself, loved, by, it, he, noted, that, he, sometimes, used, assurance, caps, to, prevent, impregnating, his, mistresses, casanova, s, ideal, liaison, had, elements, beyond, sex, including, complicated, plots, heroes, and, villains, and, gallant, outcomes, in, a, pattern, he, often, repeated, he, would, discover, an, attractive, woman, in, trouble, with, a, brutish, or, jealous, lover, act, i, he, would, ameliorate, her, difficulty, act, ii, she, would, show, her, gratitude, he, would, seduce, her, a, short, exciting, affair, would, ensue, act, iii, feeling, a, loss, of, ardor, or, boredom, setting, in, he, would, plead, his, unworthiness, and, arrange, for, her, marriage, or, pairing, with, a, worthy, man, then, exit, the, scene, act, iv, as, william, bolitho, points, out, in, twelve, against, the, gods, the, secret, of, casanova, s, success, with, women, had, nothing, more, esoteric, in, it, than, what, every, woman, who, respects, herself, must, demand, all, that, he, had, all, that, he, was, with, to, set, off, the, lack, of, legality, the, dazzling, attraction, of, the, lump, sum, over, what, is, more, regularly, doled, out, in, a, lifetime, of, installments, casanova, proclaims, there, is, no, honest, woman, with, an, uncorrupted, heart, whom, a, man, is, not, sure, of, conquering, by, dint, of, gratitude, it, is, one, of, the, surest, and, shortest, means, alcohol, and, violence, for, him, were, not, proper, tools, of, seduction, instead, attentiveness, and, small, favors, should, be, employed, to, soften, a, woman, s, heart, but, a, man, who, makes, known, his, love, by, words, is, a, fool, verbal, communication, is, essential, without, speech, the, pleasure, of, love, is, diminished, by, at, least, two, thirds, but, words, of, love, must, be, implied, not, boldly, proclaimed, casanova, claimed, to, value, intelligence, in, a, woman, after, all, a, beautiful, woman, without, a, mind, of, her, own, leaves, her, lover, with, no, resource, after, he, had, physically, enjoyed, her, charms, his, attitude, towards, educated, women, however, was, an, unfavorable, one, in, a, woman, learning, is, out, of, place, it, compromises, the, essential, qualities, of, her, sex, no, scientific, discoveries, have, been, made, by, women, which, requires, a, vigor, which, the, female, sex, cannot, have, but, in, simple, reasoning, and, in, delicacy, of, feeling, we, must, yield, to, women, casanova, s, actions, can, be, considered, by, many, in, modern, times, to, be, predatory, despite, his, own, claims, to, the, contrary, my, guiding, principle, has, been, never, to, direct, my, attack, against, novices, or, those, whose, prejudices, were, likely, to, prove, an, obstacle, especially, since, he, frequently, targeted, young, insecure, or, emotionally, exposed, women, gambling, was, a, common, recreation, in, the, social, and, political, circles, in, which, casanova, moved, in, his, memoirs, casanova, discusses, many, forms, of, 18th, century, gambling, including, lotteries, faro, basset, piquet, biribi, primero, quinze, and, whist, and, the, passion, for, it, among, the, nobility, and, the, high, clergy, cheats, known, as, correctors, of, fortune, were, somewhat, more, tolerated, than, today, in, public, casinos, and, in, private, games, for, invited, players, and, seldom, caused, affront, most, gamblers, were, on, guard, against, cheaters, and, their, tricks, scams, of, all, sorts, were, common, and, casanova, was, amused, by, them, casanova, gambled, throughout, his, adult, life, winning, and, losing, large, sums, he, was, tutored, by, professionals, and, he, was, instructed, in, those, wise, maxims, without, which, games, of, chance, ruin, those, who, participate, in, them, he, was, not, above, occasionally, cheating, and, at, times, even, teamed, with, professional, gamblers, for, his, own, profit, casanova, claims, that, he, was, relaxed, and, smiling, when, i, lost, and, i, won, without, covetousness, however, when, outrageously, duped, himself, he, could, act, violently, sometimes, calling, for, a, duel, casanova, admits, that, he, was, not, disciplined, enough, to, be, a, professional, gambler, i, had, neither, prudence, enough, to, leave, off, when, fortune, was, adverse, nor, sufficient, control, over, myself, when, i, had, won, nor, did, he, like, being, considered, as, a, professional, gambler, nothing, could, ever, be, adduced, by, professional, gamblers, that, i, was, of, their, infernal, clique, although, casanova, at, times, used, gambling, tactically, and, shrewdly, for, making, quick, money, for, flirting, making, connections, acting, gallantly, or, proving, himself, a, gentleman,
