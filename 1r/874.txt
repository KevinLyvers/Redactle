unite, the, naturalist, objectivist, strands, of, psychological, science, with, the, more, philosophical, approaches, of, marxist, orientation, however, he, also, harshly, criticized, those, of, his, colleagues, who, attempted, to, build, a, marxist, psychology, as, an, alternative, to, the, naturalist, and, philosophical, schools, he, argued, that, if, one, wanted, to, build, a, truly, marxist, psychology, there, were, no, shortcuts, to, be, found, by, merely, looking, for, applicable, quotes, in, the, writings, of, marx, rather, one, should, look, for, a, methodology, that, was, in,

at, the, experimental, defectological, institute, transformed, medical, pedagogical, station, vygotsky, was, a, pioneering, psychologist, with, interests, in, extremely, diverse, fields, his, work, covered, topics, such, as, the, origin, and, the, psychology, of, art, development, of, higher, mental, functions, philosophy, of, science, and, the, methodology, of, psychological, research, the, relation, between, learning, and, human, development, concept, formation, interrelation, between, language, and, thought, development, play, as, a, psychological, phenomenon, learning, disabilities, and, abnormal, human, development, aka, defectology, his, philosophical, framework, includes, interpretations, of, the, cognitive, role, of, mediation, tools, as, well, as, the, re, interpretation, of, well, known, concepts, in, psychology, such, as, internalization, of, knowledge, vygotsky, introduced, the, notion, of, zone, of, proximal, development, a, metaphor, capable, of, describing, the, potential, of, human, cognitive, development, his, most, important, and, widely, known, contribution, is, his, theory, for, the, development, of, higher, psychological, functions, which, emerge, through, unification, of, interpersonal, connections, and, actions, taken, within, a, given, socio, cultural, environment, i, e, language, culture, society, and, tool, use, it, was, during, this, period, that, he, identified, the, play, of, young, children, as, their, leading, activity, which, he, understood, to, be, the, main, source, of, preschoolers, psychological, development, and, which, he, viewed, as, an, expression, of, an, inseparable, unity, of, emotional, volitional, and, cognitive, development, while, vygotsky, never, met, jean, piaget, he, had, read, a, number, of, his, works, and, agreed, on, some, of, his, perspectives, on, learning, at, some, point, around, 1929, 30, vygotsky, came, to, disagree, with, piaget, s, understanding, of, learning, and, development, and, held, a, different, theoretical, position, from, piaget, on, the, topic, of, inner, speech, piaget, thought, that, egocentric, speech, follows, from, inner, speech, and, dissolved, away, as, children, matured, vygotsky, showed, that, egocentric, speech, became, inner, speech, and, then, called, thoughts, piaget, only, read, vygotsky, s, work, after, his, death, and, openly, praised, him, for, his, discovery, of, the, social, origin, of, children, s, thoughts, reasoning, and, moral, judgements, the, hypothesis, put, forward, by, vygotsky, was, a, paradigm, shift, in, psychology, he, was, first, to, propose, that, all, psychological, functions, that, govern, mental, cognitive, and, physical, actions, of, the, individual, are, not, immutable, but, have, a, history, of, cultural, development, in, human, history, and, in, everyone, personally, through, interiorization, of, cultural, tools, therefore, the, process, of, transformation, which, is, happening, when, current, cultural, tools, are, interiorized, becomes, the, focus, of, psychological, research, formerly, it, was, assumed, that, the, function, exists, in, the, individual, in, a, ready, semi, ready, or, rudimentary, form, and, in, the, group, it, unfolds, becomes, complex, advances, is, enriched, or, conversely, is, inhibited, suppressed, etc, at, present, we, have, a, basis, for, assuming, that, in, relation, to, higher, mental, functions, the, matter, must, be, presented, as, being, quite, the, opposite, functions, initially, are, formed, in, the, group, in, the, form, of, relations, of, the, children, then, they, become, mental, functions, of, the, individual, specifically, formerly, it, was, thought, that, every, child, was, capable, of, reflection, reaching, conclusions, proving, finding, bases, for, whatever, position, from, the, collision, of, such, reflections, argument, was, generated, but, the, matter, is, actually, something, else, studies, show, that, reflection, is, generated, from, argument, the, study, of, all, other, mental, functions, brings, us, to, the, same, conclusion, vygotsky, posits, the, existence, of, lower, and, higher, mental, functions, the, latter, have, social, origins, and, complex, system, structure, mediated, by, cultural, tools, and, controlled, by, an, individual, vygotsky, came, to, the, conclusion, that, consciousness, is, possible, because, of, the, mediated, nature, of, higher, psychological, functions, between, the, stimulus, and, the, reaction, of, a, person, both, behavioral, and, mental, an, additional, connection, arises, through, a, mediating, link, a, stimulus, means, or, a, sign, signs, are, tools, that, mediate, higher, psychological, functions, and, control, one, s, own, behavior, a, word, could, direct, attention, create, personal, meaning, form, a, concept, and, coordinate, vygotsky, illustrated, his, idea, of, mediation, via, buridan, s, ass, paradox, a, problematic, situation, of, choosing, between, two, equal, possibilities, interested, vygotsky, primarily, from, the, point, of, view, of, solving, it, through, a, coin, flip, redelegating, decision, to, the, outside, object, an, example, of, using, cultural, tools, to, govern, one, s, own, psychological, function, of, volition, while, developing, a, method, for, studying, higher, psychological, functions, vygotsky, was, guided, by, the, principle, of, ex, ungue, leonem, and, additionally, analyzed, phenomena, such, as, using, a, knot, in, the, handkerchief, for, remembering, and, finger, counting, vygotsky, studied, child, development, and, the, significant, roles, of, cultural, mediation, and, interpersonal, communication, he, observed, how, higher, mental, functions, developed, through, these, interactions, and, also, represented, the, shared, knowledge, of, a, culture, this, process, is, known, as, internalization, internalization, may, be, understood, in, one, respect, as, knowing, how, for, example, the, practices, of, riding, a, bicycle, or, pouring, a, cup, of, milk, initially, are, outside, and, beyond, the, child, the, mastery, of, the, skills, needed, for, performing, these, practices, occurs, through, the, activity, of, the, child, within, society, a, further, aspect, of, internalization, is, appropriation, in, which, children, take, tools, and, adapt, them, to, personal, use, perhaps, using, them, in, unique, ways, internalizing, the, use, of, a, pencil, allows, the, child, to, use, it, very, much, for, personal, ends, rather, than, drawing, exactly, what, others, in, society, have, drawn, previously, the, child, acts, and, speaks, at, the, same, time, both, are, intertwined, in, one, continuous, operation, for, him, in, this, way, a, blend, of, speech, and, action, arises, a, peculiar, mixture, from, an, adult, s, point, of, view, but, a, completely, natural, state, for, the, child, who, from, the, very, first, days, of, life, due, to, his, helplessness, finds, himself, in, conditions, where, the, path, from, him, to, things, and, from, things, to, him, goes, through, another, person, zone, of, proximal, development, zpd, is, a, term, vygotsky, used, to, characterize, an, individual, s, mental, development, he, originally, defined, the, zpd, as, the, distance, between, the, actual, developmental, level, as, determined, by, independent, problem, solving, and, the, level, of, potential, development, as, determined, through, problem, solving, under, adult, guidance, or, in, collaboration, with, more, capable, peers, he, used, the, example, of, two, children, in, school, who, originally, could, solve, problems, at, an, eight, year, old, developmental, level, that, is, typical, for, children, who, were, age, 8, after, each, child, received, assistance, from, an, adult, one, was, able, to, perform, at, a, nine, year, old, level, and, one, was, able, to, perform, at, a, twelve, year, old, level, he, said, this, difference, between, twelve, and, eight, or, between, nine, and, eight, is, what, we, call, the, zone, of, proximal, development, he, further, said, that, the, zpd, defines, those, functions, that, have, not, yet, matured, but, are, in, the, process, of, maturation, functions, that, will, mature, tomorrow, but, are, currently, in, an, embryonic, state, the, zone, is, bracketed, by, the, learner, s, current, ability, and, the, ability, they, can, achieve, with, the, aid, of, an, instructor, of, some, capacity, according, to, vygotsky, through, the, assistance, of, a, more, knowledgeable, other, a, child, is, able, to, learn, skills, or, aspects, of, a, skill, that, go, beyond, the, child, s, actual, developmental, or, maturational, level, this, assistance, is, defined, as, scaffolding, the, lower, limit, of, zpd, is, the, level, of, skill, reached, by, the, child, working, independently, also, referred, to, as, the, child, s, developmental, level, the, upper, limit, is, the, level, of, potential, skill, that, the, child, is, able, to, reach, with, the, assistance, of, a, more, capable, instructor, in, this, sense, the, zpd, provides, a, prospective, view, of, cognitive, development, as, opposed, to, a, retrospective, view, that, characterizes, development, in, terms, of, a, child, s, independent, capabilities, the, advancement, through, and, attainment, of, the, upper, limit, of, the, zpd, is, limited, by, the, instructional, and, scaffolding, related, capabilities, of, the, more, knowledgeable, other, mko, the, mko, is, typically, assumed, to, be, an, older, more, experienced, teacher, or, parent, but, often, can, be, a, learner, s, peer, or, someone, their, junior, the, mko, need, not, even, be, a, person, it, can, be, a, machine, or, book, or, other, source, of, visual, and, or, audio, input, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, vygotsky, paid, most, of, his, attention, to, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, thought, and, word, in, the, structure, of, consciousness, this, problem, was, explored, in, vygotsky, s, book, thinking, and, speech, that, was, published, posthumously, in, 1934, the, book, was, a, collection, of, essays, and, scholarly, papers, that, vygotsky, wrote, during, different, periods, of, his, thought, development, it, was, edited, by, his, closest, associates, kolbanovskii, zankov, and, shif, the, book, established, the, connection, between, speech, and, the, development, of, mental, concepts, and, awareness, vygotsky, described, silent, inner, speech, as, being, qualitatively, different, from, verbal, external, speech, but, both, equally, important, vygotsky, believed, inner, speech, developed, from, external, speech, via, a, gradual, process, of, internalization, i, e, transition, from, the, external, to, the, internal, with, younger, children, only, really, able, to, think, out, loud, he, claimed, that, in, its, mature, form, inner, speech, would, not, resemble, spoken, language, as, we, know, it, in, particular, being, greatly, compressed, hence, thought, itself, developed, socially, inner, speech, according, to, vygotsky, develops, through, the, accumulation, of, long, term, functional, and, structural, changes, it, branches, off, from, the, child, s, external, speech, along, with, the, differentiation, of, the, social, and, egocentric, functions, of, speech, and, finally, the, speech, functions, acquired, by, the, child, become, the, main, functions, of, his, thinking, in, this, work, vygotsky, points, out, the, genesis, of, the, development, of, thinking, and, speech, and, that, the, relationship, between, them, is, not, a, constant, value, but, since, we, wanted, to, express, all, this, in, one, short, formula, in, one, sentence, we, might, put, it, thus, if, at, the, beginning, of, development, there, stands, the, act, independent, of, the, word, then, at, the, end, of, it, there, stands, the, word, which, becomes, the, act, the, word, which, makes, man, s, action, free, after, vygotsky, s, early, death, his, books, and, research, were, banned, until, stalin, s, death, in, 1953, with, a, first, collection, of, major, texts, published, in, 1956, a, small, group, of, his, collaborators, and, students, were, able, to, continue, his, lines, of, thought, in, research, the, members, of, the, group, laid, a, foundation, for, the, systematic, development, of, vygotskian, psychology, in, such, diverse, fields, as, the, psychology, of, memory, p, zinchenko, perception, sensation, and, movement, zaporozhets, asnin, a, n, leont, ev, personality, lidiya, bozhovich, asnin,

psychology, of, action, zaporozhets, andrey, puzyrey, elaborated, the, ideas, of, vygotsky, in, respect, of, psychotherapy, and, even, in, the, broader, context, of, deliberate, psychological, intervention, psychotechnique, in, general, only, a, couple, of, vygotsky, s, texts, were, published, in, english, before, the, translation, of, thinking, and, speech, in, 1962, since, then, the, majority, of, his, texts, have, been, translated, and, his, ideas, have, become, influential, in, some, modern, educational, approaches, the, first, proponents, of, vygotsky, in, the, usa, were, michael, cole, and, james, wertsch, today, an, umbrella, term, for, theoretical, framework, based, on, vygotsky, s, ideas, is, cultural, historical, activity, theory, aka, chat, or, activity, theory
