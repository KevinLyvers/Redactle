athletic, instructor, in, the, physical, training, department, it, was, at, fort, eustis, that, mays, learned, the, basket, catch, from, fellow, fort, eustis, outfielder, al, fortunato, mays, by, his, own, estimation, played, 180, games, for, the, wheels, and, missed, about, 275, games, for, the, giants, because, of, his, military, service, mays, time, playing, for, the, wheels, ended, on, july, 28, 1953, after, he, chipped, a, bone, in, his, left, foot, while, sliding, into, third, base, necessitating, a, 6, week, stint, in, a, cast, discharged, on, march, 1, 1954, he, reported, to, giants,

first, 20, games, durocher, moved, him, from, third, to, fifth, in, the, batting, order, and, again, encouraged, him, to, stop, attempting, to, pull, the, ball, and, try, to, get, hits, to, right, field, mays, changed, his, batting, stance, and, stood, straighter, at, the, plate, keeping, his, feet, closer, together, he, credited, these, adjustments, with, improving, his, batting, average, as,

he, had, 36, home, runs, through, july, 28, around, that, time, durocher, asked, him, to, stop, trying, to, hit, them, explaining, the, team, wanted, him, to, reach, base, more, often, mays, hit, only, five, home, runs, after, july, 28, but, upped, his, batting, average, from, 326, to, 345, to, win, the, team, s, first, batting, title, since, bill, terry, s, in, 1930, hitting, 41, home, runs,

1954, series, is, perhaps, best, remembered, for, the, catch, an, over, the, shoulder, running, grab, by, mays, of, a, long, drive, off, the, bat, of, vic, wertz, about, 425, feet, 130, m, from, home, plate, at, the, polo, grounds, during, the, eighth, inning, of, game, 1, the, catch, prevented, two, indians, runners, from, scoring, preserving, a, tie, game, the, catch, transcended, baseball, barra, wrote, and, larry, schwartz, of, espn, said, of, all, the, catches, that, mays, made, it, is, regarded, as, his, greatest, mays, did, not, even, look, at, the, ball, for, the, last, twenty, feet, as, he, ran, saying, later, he, realized, he, had, to, keep, running, if, he, was, going, to, get, the, ball, the, giants, won, the, game, in, the, 10th, inning, on, a, three, run, home, run, by, dusty, rhodes, with, mays, scoring, the, winning, run, mays, added, base, stealing, to, his, talents, upping, his, total, from, eight, in, 1954, to, 24, in, 1955, in, the, middle, of, may, durocher, asked, him, to, try, for, more, home, runs, mays, led, the, league, with, 51, but, finished, fourth, in, nl, mvp, voting, leading, the, league, with, a, 659, slugging, percentage, mays, batted, 319, as, the, giants, finished, in, third, during, the, last, game, of, the, season, durocher, who, had, supported, mays, since, his, career, had, begun, told, him, he, would, not, be, returning, as, the, giants, manager, when, mays, responded, but, mr, leo, it, s, going, to, be, different, with, you, gone, you, won, t, be, here, to, help, me, durocher, told, his, star, willie, mays, doesn, t, need, help, from, anyone, in, 1956, mays, struggled, at, first, to, get, along, with, new, manager, bill, rigney, who, publicly, criticized, him, the, center, fielder, grew, particularly, annoyed, after, rigney, fined, him, 100, for, not, running, to, first, base, on, a, pop, fly, that, was, caught, by, the, catcher, he, hit, 36, homers, and, stole, a, career, high, 40, bases, becoming, only, the, second, player, to, join, the, 30, 30, club, though, his, rbis, 84, and, batting, average, 296, were, his, lowest, for, nearly, a, decade, barra, observed, that, willie, mays, was, still, the, best, all, around, player, in, the, national, league, the, relationship, between, mays, and, rigney, improved, in, 1957, rigney, stopped, giving, mays, as, much, direction, trusting, his, star, player, s, ability, and, instinct, in, his, 2010, authorized, biography, of, mays, james, s, hirsch, wrote, mays, had, one, of, his, most, exhilarating, excursions, on, april, 21, in, the, game, against, the, phillies, mays, reached, second, base, on, an, error, stole, third, and, scored, the, winning, run, on, a, hank, sauer, single, all, on, plays, close, enough, that, he, had, to, slide, to, make, each, one, he, stole, home, in, a, 4, 3, loss, to, the, cubs, on, may, 21, the, 1957, season, was, the, first, in, which, the, gold, glove, awards, were, presented, mays, won, the, first, of, 12, consecutive, gold, gloves, for, his, play, in, center, field, he, finished, in, the, nl, s, top, five, in, a, variety, of, offensive, categories, runs, scored, 112, third, batting, average, 333, second, and, home, runs, 35, fourth, in, 1957, mays, became, the, fourth, player, in, major, league, history, to, join, the, 20, 20, 20, club, doubles, triples, homers, he, stole, 38, bases, that, year, making, him, the, second, 20, 20, 20, club, member, after, frank, schulte, in, 1911, to, steal, at, least, 20, bases, this, gave, him, his, second, straight, 30, 30, club, season, dwindling, attendance, and, the, desire, for, a, new, ballpark, prompted, the, giants, to, move, to, san, francisco, following, the, 1957, season, in, the, final, giants, home, game, at, the, polo, grounds, on, september, 29, 1957, fans, gave, mays, a, standing, ovation, in, the, middle, of, his, final, at, bat, after, pirates, pitcher, bob, friend, had, already, thrown, a, pitch, to, him, in, 1958, rigney, wanted, mays, to, challenge, babe, ruth, s, record, of, 60, home, runs, in, a, season, consequently, rigney, did, not, play, mays, much, in, spring, training, hoping, to, use, his, best, hitter, every, day, of, the, regular, season, as, he, had, in, 1954, mays, vied, for, the, nl, batting, title, until, the, final, game, of, the, season, moved, to, the, leadoff, slot, the, last, day, to, increase, his, at, bats, mays, collected, three, hits, in, the, game, to, finish, with, a, career, high, 347, but, philadelphia, s, richie, ashburn, batted, 350, mays, shared, the, inaugural, nl, player, of, the, month, award, with, stan, musial, in, may, batting, 405, with, 12, home, runs, and, 29, runs, batted, in, he, won, a, second, award, in, september, 434, 4, home, runs,

for, 1959, mays, had, his, first, serious, injury, in, 1959, a, collision, with, sammy, white, in, spring, training, that, resulted, in, 35, stitches, in, his, leg, but, he, was, ready, by, the, start, of, the, season, against, the, reds, in, august, mays, broke, a, finger, but, kept, it, a, secret, to, prevent, opposing, pitchers, from, targeting, it, in, september, 1959, the, giants, led, the, nl, pennant, race, by, two, games, with, only, eight, games, to, play, but, a, sweep, by, the, dodgers, began, a, stretch, of, six, losses, in, those, final, games, dooming, them, to, a, third, place, finish, mays, had, hits, in, three, out, of, 10, at, bats, in, the, dodger, series, but, some, san, francisco, fans, still, booed, him, in, 1959, mays, batted, 313, with, 34, home, runs, and, 113, rbis, leading, the, league, in, stolen, bases, for, the, fourth, year, in, a, row, after, spending, their, first, two, years, in, san, francisco, at, seals, stadium, the, giants, moved, into, the, new, candlestick, park, in, 1960, initially, the, stadium, was, expected, to, be, conducive, to, home, runs, but, unpredictable, winds, affected, mays, s, power, and, he, hit, only, 12, at, home, in, 1960, he, found, the, stadium, tricky, to, field, but, figured, out, how, to, play, it, as, the, season, progressed, when, a, fly, ball, was, hit, he, would, count, to, five, before, giving, pursuit, enabling, him, to, judge, the, wind, s, effect, he, hit, two, home, runs, on, june, 24, and, stole, home, in, a, 5, 3, victory, over, the, cincinnati, reds, on, september, 15, he, tied, an, nl, record, with, three, triples, in, an, 11, inning, 8, 6, win, over, the, phillies, i, don, t, like, to, talk, about, 1960, mays, said, after, the, final, game, of, a, season, in, which, the, giants, pre, season, favorites, for, the, pennant, finished, fifth, out, of, eight, nl, teams, for, the, second, time, in, three, years, he, only, hit, 29, home, runs, but, he, led, the, nl, with, 190, hits, and, drove, in, 103, runs, batting, 319, and, stealing, 25, bases, alvin, dark, was, hired, to, manage, the, giants, before, the, start, of, the, 1961, season, and, the, improving, giants, finished, in, third, place, mays, had, one, of, his, best, games, on, april, 30, 1961, hitting, four, home, runs, and, driving, in, eight, runs, against, the, milwaukee, braves, at, county, stadium, according, to, mays, he, had, been, unsure, if, he, would, even, play, because, of, food, poisoning, each, of, his, home, runs, traveled, over, 400, feet, 120, m, while, mantle, and, roger, maris, pursued, babe, ruth, s, single, season, home, run, record, in, the, al, mays, and, orlando, cepeda, battled, for, the, home, run, lead, in, the, nl, mays, trailed, cepeda, by, two, home, runs, at, the, end, of, august, 34, as, opposed, to, 36, but, cepeda, outhit, him, 10, 6, in, september, to, finish, with, 46, while, mays, finished, with, 40, mays, led, the, league, with, 129, runs, scored, and, batted, 308, with, 123, rbis, though, he, had, continued, to, play, at, a, high, level, since, coming, to, san, francisco, mays, endured, booing, from, the, san, francisco, fans, during, his, first, four, seasons, in, california, barra, speculates, this, may, have, been, because, san, francisco, fans, were, comparing, mays, unfavorably, with, joe, dimaggio, the, most, famous, center, fielder, ever, to, come, from, san, francisco, hal, wood, mentioned, the, dimaggio, theory, as, well, as, two, other, explanations, 1, the, fans, had, heard, so, many, wonderful, things, about, mays, s, play, in, new, york, that, they, expected, him, to, be, a, better, player, than, he, actually, was, and, 2, mays, tended, to, keep, to, himself, mays, said, in, 1959, that, he, did, not, mind, the, booing, but, he, admitted, in, a, 1961, article, that, the, catcalls, were, bothering, him, whatever, the, reason, the, boos, which, had, begun, to, subside, after, mays, s, four, home, run, game, in, 1961, grew, even, quieter, in, 1962, as, the, giants, enjoyed, their, best, season, since, moving, to, san, francisco, mays, led, the, team, in, eight, offensive, categories, in, 1962, runs, 130, doubles, 36, home, runs, 49, rbis, 141, stolen, bases, 18, walks, 78, on, base, percentage, 384, and, slugging, percentage, 613, he, finished, second, in, nl, mvp, voting, to, maury, wills, who, had, broken, ty, cobb, s, record, for, stolen, bases, in, a, season, on, september, 30, mays, hit, a, game, winning, home, run, in, the, giants, final, regularly, scheduled, game, of, the, year, forcing, the, team, into, a, tie, for, first, place, with, the, los, angeles, dodgers, the, giants, faced, the, dodgers, in, a, three, game, playoff, series, with, the, giants, trailing, 4, 2, in, the, top, of, the, ninth, inning, of, game, 3, mays, hit, an, rbi, single, eventually, scoring, as, the, giants, took, a, 6, 4, lead, with, two, outs, in, the, bottom, of, the, inning, lee, walls, hit, a, fly, ball, to, center, field, which, mays, caught, for, the, final, out, as, the, giants, advanced, to, the, world, series, against, the, yankees, in, game, 1, of, the, world, series, a, 6, 2, loss, to, new, york, mays, recorded, three, hits, he, would, bat, merely, 250, in, the, series, overall, the, series, went, all, the, way, to, a, game, 7, which, the, yankees, led, 1, 0, in, the, bottom, of, the, ninth, matty, alou, led, off, the, inning, with, a, bunt, single, but, was, still, at, first, two, outs, later, when, mays, came, up, with, the, giants, one, out, from, elimination, batting, against, ralph, terry, he, hit, a, ball, into, the, right, field, corner, that, might, have, been, deep, enough, to, score, alou, but, giants, third, base, coach, whitey, lockman, opted, to, hold, alou, at, third, the, next, batter, mccovey, hit, a, line, drive, that, was, caught, by, bobby, richardson, and, the, yankees, won, the, deciding, game, 1, 0, it, was, mays, s, last, world, series, appearance, as, a, giant, mays, reveled, in, the, fact, that, he, had, finally, won, the, support, of, san, francisco, fans, it, only, took, them, five, years, he, later, said, before, the, 1963, season, mays, signed, a, contract, worth, a, record, setting, 105, 000, per, season, equivalent, to, 1, 040, 000, in, 2023, on, july, 2, when, spahn, and, juan, marichal, each, threw, 15, scoreless, innings, mays, hit, a, 16th, inning, home, run, off, spahn, giving, the, giants, a, 1, 0, victory, he, considered, the, home, run, one, of, his, most, important, along, with, his, first, and, the, four, home, run, game, in, august, he, won, his, third, nl, player, of, the, month, award, after, batting, 387, with, eight, home, runs, and, 27, rbis, he, hit, his, 400th, home, run, on, august, 27, against, the, st, louis, cardinals, the, tenth, player, to, reach, that, mark, mays, finished, the, 1963, season, batting, 314, with, 38, home, runs, and, 103, rbis, stealing, only, eight, bases, his, fewest, since, 1954, normally, the, third, batter, in, the, lineup, mays, was, moved, to, fourth, in, 1964, before, returning, to, third, in, subsequent, years, on, may, 21, dark, named, mays, the, giants, captain, making, mays, the, first, african, american, captain, of, an, mlb, team, you, deserve, it, dark, told, mays, you, should, have, had, it, long, before, this, against, the, phillies, on, september, 4, mays, made, what, hirsch, called, one, of, the, most, acrobatic, catches, of, his, career, rub, n, amaro, sr, hit, a, ball, to, the, scoreboard, at, philadelphia, s, connie, mack, stadium, mays, who, had, been, playing, closer, to, home, plate, than, normal, ran, at, top, speed, after, the, ball, he, caught, it, in, midair, and, had, to, kick, his, legs, forward, to, keep, his, head, from, hitting, the, ballpark, s, fence, but, he, held, on, to, the, ball, while, he, batted, under, 300, 296, for, the, first, time, since, 1956, he, led, the, nl, with, 47, home, runs, and, ranked, second, with, 121, runs, scored, and, 111, rbis, a, torn, shoulder, muscle, sustained, in, a, 1965, game, against, the, atlanta, braves, impaired, mays, s, ability, to, throw, he, kept, the, injury, a, secret, from, opposing, players, making, two, or, three, practice, throws, before, games, to, discourage, them, from, running, on, him, on, august, 22, mays, acted, as, a, peacemaker, during, a, 14, minute, brawl, between, the, giants, and, dodgers, after, marichal, had, bloodied, dodgers, catcher, john, roseboro, with, a, bat, mays, grabbed, roseboro, by, the, waist, and, helped, him, off, the, field, then, tackled, lou, johnson, to, keep, him, from, attacking, an, umpire, johnson, kicked, him, in, the, head, and, nearly, knocked, him, out, after, the, brawl, mays, hit, a, game, winning, three, run, home, run, against, sandy, koufax, but, he, did, not, finish, the, game, feeling, dizzy, after, the, home, run, mays, won, his, fourth, and, final, nl, player, of, the, month, award, in, august, 1965, 363, 17, home, runs, 29, rbis, on, september, 13, he, hit, his, 500th, career, home, run, off, don, nottebart, becoming, the, fifth, player, to, reach, the, mark, warren, spahn, off, whom, mays, hit, his, first, career, home, run, was, now, his, teammate, after, the, home, run, spahn, asked, him, was, it, anything, like, the, same, feeling, mays, replied, it, was, exactly, the, same, feeling, same, pitch, too, the, next, night, mays, hit, one, that, he, considered, his, most, dramatic, with, the, giants, trailing, the, houston, astros, by, two, runs, with, two, outs, in, the, ninth, mays, swung, and, missed, at, claude, raymond, s, first, two, pitches, took, three, balls, to, load, the, count, and, fouled, off, three, pitches, before, homering, on, the, ninth, pitch, the, giants, won, 6, 5, in, 10, innings, mays, won, his, second, mvp, award, in, 1965, behind, a, career, high, 52, home, runs, in, what, barra, said, may, very, well, have, his, best, year, he, batted, 317, leading, the, nl, in, on, base, percentage, 400, and, slugging, percentage, 645, the, span, of, 11, years, between, his, mvp, awards, was, the, longest, gap, of, any, major, leaguer, who, attained, the, distinction, more, than, once, as, were, the, 10, years, between, his, 50, home, run, seasons, he, scored, 118, runs, the, 12th, year, in, a, row, he, had, scored, at, least, 100, runs, in, a, season, mays, tied, mel, ott, s, nl, record, of, 511, home, runs, on, april, 24, 1966, against, the, astros, after, that, he, went, for, nine, days, without, a, home, run, i, started, thinking, home, run, every, time, i, got, up, mays, explained, the, slump, he, finally, set, the, record, may, 4, despite, nursing, an, injured, thigh, muscle, on, september, 7, mays, reached, base, in, the, 11th, inning, of, a, game, against, the, dodgers, with, two, outs, then, attempted, to, score, from, first, base, on, a, frank, johnson, single, on, a, close, play, umpire, tony, venzon, initially, ruled, him, out, then, changed, the, call, when, he, saw, roseboro, had, dropped, the, ball, after, mays, collided, with, him, san, francisco, won, 3, 2, mays, finished, third, in, the, nl, mvp, voting, the, ninth, and, final, time, he, finished, in, the, top, five, in, the, voting, for, the, award, he, batted, 288, with, 99, runs, scored, 37, home, runs, and, 103,

into, a, slump, on, june, 7, gary, nolan, of, the, cincinnati, reds, struck, him, out, four, times, this, was, the, first, time, in, his, career, this, had, happened, though, the, giants, still, won, the, game, 4, 3, afflicted, by, a, fever, on, july, 14, mays, left, that, day, s, game, after, the, sixth, inning, because, of, fatigue, and, spent, five, days, in, a, hospital, after, i, got, back, into, the, lineup, i, never, felt, strong, again, for, the, rest, of, the, season, he, recalled, in, 141, games, mays, hit, 263, with, 83, runs, scored, 128, hits, and, 22, home, runs, he, had, only, 70, rbis, for, the, year, the, first, time, since, 1958, he, had, failed, to, reach, 100, before, a, game, in, houston, on, may, 6, 1968, astros, owner, roy, hofheinz, presented, mays, with, a, 569, pound, birthday, cake, for, his, 37th, birthday, the, pounds, represented, every, home, run, mays, had, hit, in, his, career, after, sharing, some, of, it, with, his, teammates, mays, sent, the, rest, to, the, texas, children, s, hospital, he, played, 148, games, and, upped, his, batting, average, to, 289, accumulating, 84, runs, scored, 144, hits, 23, home, runs, and, 79, runs, batted, in, in, 1969, new, giants, manager, clyde, king, moved, mays, to, the, leadoff, position, in, the, batting, lineup, because, mays, was, hitting, fewer, home, runs, mays, privately, chafed, at, the, move, later, comparing, it, to, o, j, simpson, blocking, for, the, fullback, he, injured, his, knee, in, a, collision, with, catcher, randy, hundley, on, july, 29, forcing, him, to, miss, several, games, on, september, 22, he, hit, his, 600th, home, run, saying, later, winning, the, game, was, more, important, to, me, than, any, individual, achievements, in, 117, games, he, batted, 283, with, 13, home, runs, and, 58, runs, batted, in, the, sporting, news, named, mays, the, 1960s, player, of, the, decade, in, january, 1970, in, an, april, game, mays, collided, with, bobby, bonds, while, reaching, his, glove, over, the, wall, but, made, a, catch, to, rob, bobby, tolan, of, a, home, run, mays, picked, up, his, 3, 000th, hit, against, the, montreal, expos, on, july, 18, i, don, t, feel, excitement, about, this, now, he, told, reporters, afterwards, the, main, thing, i, wanted, to, do, was, help, gaylord, perry, win, a, game, in, 139, games, mays, batted, 291, with, 94, runs, scored, 28, home, runs, and, 83, rbis, he, scheduled, his, off, days, that, season, to, avoid, facing, strikeout, pitchers, such, as, bob, gibson, or, tom, seaver, though, center, field, remained, his, primary, position, in, 1971, mays, played, 48, games, at, first, base, he, got, off, to, a, fast, start, in, 1971, the, year, he, turned, 40, against, the, mets, on, may, 31, he, hit, a, game, tying, eighth, inning, home, run, saved, multiple, runs, with, his, defense, at, first, base, and, performed, a, strategic, base, running, maneuver, with, one, out, in, the, 11th, inning, running, slowly, from, second, to, third, base, to, draw, a, throw, from, tim, foli, and, allow, al, gallagher, to, reach, first, safely, evading, foli, s, tag, on, the, return, throw, to, third, mays, scored, the, winning, run, on, a, sacrifice, fly, he, had, 15, home, runs, and, a, 290, average, at, the, all, star, break, but, faded, down, the, stretch, only, hitting, three, home, runs, and, batting, 241, for, the, rest, of, the, year, one, reason, he, hit, so, few, home, runs, was, that, mays, walked, 112, times, 30, more, times, than, he, had, at, any, point, in, his, career, this, was, partly, because, willie, mccovey, who, often, batted, behind, mays, in, the, lineup, missed, several, games, with, injuries, causing, pitchers, to, pitch, carefully, to, mays, so, they, could, concentrate, on, getting, less, skilled, hitters, out, subsequently, mays, led, the, league, in, on, base, percentage, 425, for, only, the, second, time, though, his, 123, strikeouts, were, a, career, high, he, batted, 271, and, stole, 23, bases, the, giants, won, the, nl, west, in, 1971, returning, mays, to, the, playoffs, for, the, first, time, since, 1962, in, the, nl, championship, series, nlcs, against, the, pirates, mays, had, a, home, run, and, three, rbis, in, the, first, two, games, in, game, 3, mays, attempted, an, unsuccessful, sacrifice, bunt, in, a, 1, 1, tie, in, the, sixth, with, no, outs, and, tito, fuentes, on, second, base, a, move, that, surprised, reporters, covering, the, game, the, giants, lost, 2, 1, i, was, thinking, of, the, best, way, to, get, the, run, in, mays, explained, the, bunt, pointing, out, that, mccovey, and, bonds, were, due, up, next, the, giants, lost, the, series, in, four, games, after, the, season, mays, was, honored, as, the, winner, of, the, inaugural, roberto, clemente, award, known, at, that, time, as, the, commissioner, s, award, mays, got, off, to, a, tortuous, start, to, the, 1972, season, batting, 184, through, his, first, 19, games, before, the, season, began, he, had, asked, stoneham, for, a, 10, year, contract, with, the, giants, organization, intending, to, serve, in, an, off, the, field, capacity, with, them, once, his, playing, career, was, over, the, giants, organization, was, having, financial, troubles, and, mays, had, to, settle, for, a, two, year, 330, 000, contract, mays, quibbled, with, manager, charlie, fox, leaving, the, stadium, before, the, start, of, a, doubleheader, on, april, 30, without, telling, him, on, may, 11, 1972, mays, was, traded, to, the, new, york, mets, for, pitcher, charlie, williams, and, an, undisclosed, amount, rumored, to, be, 100, 000, the, mets, agreed, to, keep, his, salary, at, 165, 000, a, year, for, 1972, and, 1973, promising, to, pay, mays, 50, 000, a, year, for, 10, years, after, he, retired, mays, had, remained, popular, in, new, york, and, owner, joan, payson, had, long, wanted, to, bring, him, back, to, his, major, league, roots, in, his, mets, debut, against, the, giants, on, may, 14, mays, put, new, york, ahead, to, stay, with, a, fifth, inning, home, run, receiving, ecstatic, applause, from, the, fans, at, shea, stadium, mays, appeared, in, 88, games, for, the, mets, in, 1972, batting, 250, in, 244, at, bats, with, eight, home, runs, in, 1973, mays, showed, up, a, day, late, to, spring, training, then, left, in, the, middle, of, it, without, notifying, manager, yogi, berra, beforehand, he, was, fined, 1, 000, upon, returning, a, sportswriter, joked, half, the, fine, was, for, leaving, half, was, for, returning, things, did, not, improve, as, the, season, began, mays, spent, time, on, the, disabled, list, early, in, the, year, and, left, the, park, before, a, game, when, he, found, out, berra, had, not, put, his, name, in, the, starting, lineup, his, speed, and, powerful, arm, in, the, outfield, assets, throughout, his, career, were, diminished, in, 1973, and, he, only, made, the, all, star, team, because, of, a, special, intervention, by, nl, president, chub, feeney, however, the, mets, won, the, nl, east, on, august, 17, 1973, mays, hit, his, final, 660th, home, run, against, the, reds, don, gullett, having, considered, retirement, all, year, mays, finally, told, the, mets, officially, on, september, 9, that, 1973, would, be, his, last, season, he, made, the, announcement, to, the, public, on, september, 20, i, thought, i, d, be, crying, by, now, he, told, reporters, and, mets, executives, at, a, press, conference, that, day, but, i, see, so, many, people, here, who, are, my, friends, i, can, t, baseball, and, me, we, had, what, you, might, call, a, love, affair, five, days, later, the, mets, honored, him, on, willie, mays, night, proclaimed, by, new, york, city, mayor, john, lindsay, where, he, thanked, the, new, york, fans, and, said, goodbye, to, baseball, in, 66, games, mays, batted, a, career, low, 211, with, six, home, runs, against, the, reds, in, the, nlcs, mays, helped, restore,

pinch, hit, rbi, single, as, the, mets, won, 7, 2, clinching, a, trip, to, the, 1973, world, series, against, the, oakland, athletics, october, 13, 21, a, shoulder, injury, to, rusty, staub, prompted, the, mets, to, shift, don, hahn, to, right, field, and, start, mays, in, center, at, the, start, of, the, series, he, stumbled, four, times, in, the, first, two, games, including, a, fielding, error, in, game, 2, that, allowed, the, athletics, to, tie, the, game, and, force, extra, innings, mays, s, last, hit, came, later, in, the, same, game, an, rbi, single, against, rollie, fingers, that, snapped, a, 7, 7, tie, in, the, 12th, inning, of, a, 10, 7, victory, his, final, at, bat, came, in, game, 3, on, october, 16, 1973, where, he, pinch, hit, for, tug, mcgraw, and, grounded, into, a, force, play, the, mets, lost, the, series, in, seven, games, mays, s, 24, appearances, on, an, all, star, game, roster, are, tied, with, musial, for, second, all, time, behind, only, hank, aaron, s, 25, he, strove, for, all, star, glory, according, to, hirsch, taking, the, game, seriously, in, his, desire, to, support, his, nl, teammates, in, the, first, all, star, game, of, 1959, mays, hit, a, game, winning, triple, against, whitey, ford, bob, stevens, of, the, san, francisco, chronicle, wrote, that, harvey, kuenn, gave, it, honest, pursuit, but, the, only, center, fielder, in, baseball, who, could, have, caught, it, hit, it, mays, scored, the, winning, run, in, the, bottom, of, the, 10th, inning, of, the, first, all, star, game, of, 1961, on, a, clemente, single, in, a, 5, 4, win,

hit, by, joe, pepitone, that, might, have, given, the, al, the, lead, the, nl, won, 5, 3, and, mays, was, named, the, all, star, game, mvp, with, a, leadoff, home, run, against, milt, pappas, in, the, 1965, all, star, game, mays, set, a, record, for, most, hits, in, his, all, star, games, 21, mays, led, off, the, 1968, all, star, game, with, a, single, moved, to, second, on, an, error, advanced, to, third, base, on, a, wild, pitch, and, scored, the, only, run, of, the, game, when, mccovey, hit, into, a, double, play, for, his, contributions, mays, won, the, all, star, game, mvp, award, for, the, second, time, mays, individually, holds, the, records, for, most, at, bats, 75, hits, 23, runs, scored, 20, and, stolen, bases, six, by, an, all, star, additionally, he, is, tied, with, musial, for, the, most, extra, base, hits, eight, and, total, bases, 40, and, he, is, tied, with, brooks, robinson, for, the, most, triples, three, in, all, star, game, history, in, appreciation, of, his, all, star, records, ted, williams, said, they, invented, the, all, star, game, for, willie, mays, during, the, first, part, of, his, career, mays, often, participated, in, barnstorming, tours, after, his, regular, season, with, the, giants, ended, teams, of, star, players, would, travel, from, city, to, city, playing, exhibition, games, for, local, fans, following, his, rookie, year, mays, went, on, a, barnstorming, tour, with, an, all, star, team, assembled, by, campanella, playing, in, negro, league, stadiums, around, the, southern, united, states, from, 1955, through, 1958, mays, led, willie, mays, all, stars, a, team, composed, of, such, stars, as, irvin, thompson, aaron, frank, robinson, junior, gilliam, brooks, lawrence, sam, jones, and, joe, black, the, team, travelled, around, the, southern, united, states, the, first, two, years, attaining, crowds, of, about, 5, 000, in, 1955, but, drawing, less, than, 1, 000, in, 1956, partly, because, of, the, advent, of, television, in, 1957, the, team, went, to, mexico, puerto, rico, and, the, dominican, republic, drawing, 117, 766, fans, in, 15, games, 14, of, which, were, won, by, mays, s, team, they, played, 20, games, in, mexico, in, 1958, mays, did, not, lead, a, team, in, 1959, stoneham, wanted, him, to, rest, because, he, was, suffering, from, a, broken, finger, in, 1960, mays, also, did, not, barnstorm, but, he, and, the, giants, did, go, to, tokyo, playing, an, exhibition, series, of, 16, games, against, the, yomiuri, giants, though, teams, of, black, all, stars, assembled, those, two, seasons, they, drew, fewer, fans, and, opted, not, to, assemble, in, 1961, when, mays, again, decided, not, to, barnstorm, the, tradition, soon, died, out, as, the, expansion, of, the, major, leagues, the, increased, televising, of, major, league, games, and, the, emergence, of, professional, football, had, siphoned, interest, away, from, the, offseason, exhibition, games, the, batting, stance, mays, employed, showed, the, influence, of, one, of, his, childhood, favorites, joe, dimaggio, like, his, hero, mays, would, stand, with, his, legs, spread, apart, placing, the, same, amount, of, weight, on, both, while, holding, the, bat, high, his, right, thumb, would, stick, out, in, the, air, as, he, waited, for, pitches, but, he, wrapped, it, around, the, bat, as, he, swung, mays, believed, this, late, motion, added, power, when, he, swung, mays, channelled, his, energies, into, the, swing, by, abstaining, from, extra, motion, and, opening, his, hips, if, there, was, a, machine, to, measure, each, swing, of, a, bat, branch, rickey, suggested, it, would, be, proven, that, mays, swings, with, more, power, and, bat, speed, pitch, for, pitch, than, any, other, player, his, focus, extended, to, his, antics, or, lack, thereof, at, the, plate, mays, did, not, rub, dirt, on, his, hands, or, stroll, around, the, batter, s, box, like, some, hitters, did, naturally, more, of, a, pull, hitter, mays, adjusted, his, style, in, 1954, to, hit, more, to, right, and, center, field, in, a, quest, for, a, higher, batting, average, at, his, manager, s, request, but, the, change, was, not, permanent, when, the, giants, moved, to, candlestick, park, mays, found, that, pulling, the, ball, worked, better, at, home, but, hitting, to, right, and, center, worked, better, on, the, road, he, tried, to, adjust, his, style, depending, on, where, he, was, playing, defensively, mays, was, one, of, the, best, outfielders, of, all, time, as, evidenced, by, his, record, 12, gold, gloves, as, an, outfielder, his, signature, play, was, his, basket, catch, the, technique, that, displayed, mays, s, stylistic, flash, as, opposed, to, the, pure, raw, skill, that, was, on, display, when, he, made, the, catch, in, the, 1954, world, series, holding, his, glove, around, his, belly, he, would, keep, his, palm, turned, up, enabling, the, ball, to, fall, right, into, his, glove, sportswriters, have, argued, about, whether, the, technique, made, him, a, better, fielder, or, just, made, him, more, exciting, to, watch, but, the, basket, catch, did, not, prevent, mays, from, setting, a, record, with, 7, 095, outfield, putouts, koppett, observes, his, range, was, limitless, and, his, arm, so, strong, that, he, could, make, effective, throws, from, the, most, unlikely, locations, and, from, the, most, unlikely, body, positions, that, range, allowed, him, to, play, a, shallow, center, and, prevent, shallow, singles, while, still, being, able, to, get, back, and, not, let, extra, base, hits, get, over, his, head, mays, s, flashy, style, of, play, stemmed, partly, from, his, days, in, the, negro, leagues, we, were, all, entertainers, he, said, and, my, job, was, to, give, the, fans, something, to, talk, about, each, game, sometimes, he, would, deliberately, slip, to, the, ground, for, catches, to, make, them, look, tougher, than, they, really, were, he, wore, his, cap, one, size, larger, than, necessary, so, that, it, would, fly, off, when, he, was, running, the, bases, or, making, fielding, plays, though, he, was, a, powerful, hitter, he, had, a, knack, for, stealing, bases, he, ran, the, bases, daringly, becoming, the, only, modern, player, to, score, from, first, base, on, a, single, to, left, field, and, another, time, scoring, from, first, base, on, a, mccovey, bunt, without,

out, there, wasn, t, he, s, too, good, for, this, world, if, somebody, came, up, and, hit, 450, stole, 100, bases, and, performed, a, miracle, in, the, field, every, day, i, d, still, look, you, in,
