samudragupta, gupta, script, sa, mu, dra, gu, pta, c, 335, 375, ce, was, the, second, emperor, of, the, gupta, empire, of, ancient, india, and, is, regarded, among, the, greatest, rulers, of, india, as, a, son, of, the, gupta, emperor, chandragupta, i, and, the, licchavi, princess, kumaradevi, he, greatly, expanded, his, dynasty, s, political, and, military, power, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, a, prashasti, eulogy, composed, by, his, courtier, harisena, credits, him, with, extensive, military, conquests, it, suggests, that, he, defeated, several, kings, of, northern, india, and, annexed, their, territories, into, his, empire, he, also, marched, along, the, south, eastern, coast, of, india, advancing, as, far, south, as, kanchipuram, in, the, pallava, kingdom, in, addition, he, subjugated, several, frontier, kingdoms, and, tribal, oligarchies, at, the, height, of, his, power, his, empire, under, his, direct, control, extended, from, ravi, river, in, the, west, present, day, punjab, to, the, brahmaputra, river, in, the, east, present, day, assam, and, from, the, himalayan, foothills, in, the, north, to, central, india, in, the, south, west, several, rulers, along, the, south, eastern, coast, were, also, his, tributaries, the, inscription, also, states, that, many, neighbouring, rulers, tried, to, please, him, which, probably, refers, to, his, friendly, relations, with, them, he, performed, the, ashvamedha, sacrifice, to, prove, his, imperial, sovereignty, and, remained, undefeated, in, battle, his, gold, coins, and, inscriptions, suggest, that, he, was, an, accomplished, poet, and, also, played, musical, instruments, such, as, the, veena, his, expansionist, policy, was, continued, by, his, son, and, successor, chandragupta, ii, modern, scholars, variously, assign, the, start, of, samudragupta, s, reign, from, c, 319, ce, to, c, 350, ce, the, inscriptions, of, the, gupta, kings, are, dated, in, the, gupta, calendar, era, whose, epoch, is, generally, dated, to, c, 319, ce, however, the, identity, of, the, era, s, founder, is, a, matter, of, debate, and, scholars, variously, attribute, its, establishment, to, chandragupta, i, or, samudragupta, chandragupta, i, probably, had, a, long, reign, as, the, prayag, pillar, inscription, suggests, that, he, appointed, his, son, as, his, successor, presumably, after, reaching, an, old, age, however, the, exact, period, of, his, reign, is, uncertain, for, these, reasons, the, beginning, of, samudragupta, s, reign, is, also, uncertain, if, samudragupta, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, gupta, era, his, ascension, can, be, dated, to, c, 319, 320, ce, on, the, other, hand, if, his, father, chandragupta, i, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, gupta, era, samudragupta, s, ascension, must, be, dated, to, a, later, date, samudragupta, was, a, contemporary, of, king, meghavarna, of, anuradhapura, kingdom, but, the, regnal, period, of, this, king, is, also, uncertain, according, to, the, traditional, reckoning, adopted, in, sri, lanka, for, buddha, s, death, he, ruled, during, 304, 332, ce, but, the, modified, chronology, adopted, by, modern, scholars, such, as, wilhelm, geiger, assigns, his, reign, to, 352, 379, ce, accepting, the, former, date, would, place, samudragupta, s, ascension, to, c, 320, ce, accepting, the, latter, date, would, place, it, around, c, 350, ce, the, end, of, samudragupta, s, reign, is, also, uncertain, samudragupta, s, granddaughter, prabhavatigupta, is, known, to, have, married, during, the, reign, of, his, son, chandragupta, ii, in, c, 380, ce, assuming, c, 319, ce, as, the, epoch, of, the, gupta, era, therefore, the, end, of, samudragupta, s, reign, can, be, placed, before, this, year, various, estimates, of, samudragupta, s, regnal, period, include, samudragupta, was, a, son, of, the, gupta, emperor, chandragupta, i, and, queen, kumaradevi, who, came, from, the, licchavi, clan, his, fragmentary, eran, stone, inscription, states, that, his, father, selected, him, as, the, successor, because, of, his, devotion, righteous, conduct, and, valour, his, allahabad, pillar, inscription, similarly, describes, how, chandragupta, i, called, him, a, noble, person, in, front, of, the, courtiers, and, appointed, him, to, protect, the, earth, these, descriptions, suggest, that, chandragupta, i, renounced, the, throne, in, his, old, age, and, appointed, his, son, as, the, next, emperor, according, to, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, when, chandragupta, i, appointed, him, as, the, next, emperor, the, faces, of, other, people, of, equal, birth, bore, a, melancholy, look, one, interpretation, suggests, that, these, other, people, were, neighbouring, kings, and, samudagupta, s, ascension, to, the, throne, was, uncontested, another, theory, is, that, these, other, people, were, gupta, princes, with, a, rival, claim, to, the, throne, if, emperor, chandragputa, i, indeed, had, multiple, sons, it, is, likely, that, samudragupta, s, background, as, the, son, of, a, lichchhavi, princess, worked, in, his, favour, the, coins, of, a, gupta, ruler, named, kacha, whose, identity, is, debated, by, modern, scholars, describe, him, as, the, exterminator, of, all, kings, these, coins, closely, resemble, the, coins, issued, by, samudragupta, according, to, one, theory, kacha, was, an, earlier, name, of, samudragupta, and, the, emperor, later, adopted, the, regnal, name, samudra, ocean, after, extending, his, empire, s, dominion, as, far, as, the, ocean, an, alternative, theory, is, that, kacha, was, a, distinct, king, possibly, a, rival, claimant, to, the, throne, who, flourished, before, or, after, samudragupta, the, gupta, inscriptions, suggest, that, samudragupta, had, a, remarkable, military, career, the, eran, stone, inscription, of, samudragupta, states, that, he, had, brought, the, whole, tribe, of, kings, under, his, suzerainty, and, that, his, enemies, were, terrified, when, they, thought, of, him, in, their, dreams, the, inscription, does, not, name, any, of, the, defeated, kings, presumably, because, its, primary, objective, was, to, record, the, installation, of, a, vishnu, idol, in, a, temple, but, it, suggests, that, samudragupta, had, subdued, several, kings, by, this, time, the, later, allahabad, pillar, inscription, a, panegyric, written, by, samudragupta, s, minister, and, military, officer, harishena, credits, him, with, extensive, conquests, it, gives, the, most, detailed, account, of, samudragupta, s, military, conquests, listing, them, in, mainly, geographical, and, partly, chronological, order, it, states, that, samudragupta, fought, a, hundred, battles, acquired, a, hundred, wounds, that, looked, like, marks, of, glory, and, earned, the, title, prakrama, valourous, the, mathura, stone, inscription, of, chandragupta, ii, describes, samudragupta, as, an, exterminator, of, all, kings, as, someone, who, had, no, equally, powerful, enemy, and, as, a, person, whose, fame, was, tasted, by, the, waters, of, the, four, oceans, modern, scholars, offer, various, opinions, regarding, samudragupta, s, possible, motivations, behind, his, extensive, military, campaigns, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, suggests, that, samudragupta, s, aim, was, the, unification, of, the, earth, dharani, bandha, which, suggests, that, he, may, have, aspired, to, become, a, chakravartin, a, universal, ruler, the, ashvamedha, performances, by, the, nagas, whom, he, defeated, may, have, influenced, him, as, well, his, southern, expedition, may, have, been, motivated, by, economic, considerations, of, controlling, the, trade, between, india, and, south, east, asia, the, early, portion, of, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, mentions, that, samudragupta, uprooted, achyuta, nagasena, and, a, ruler, whose, name, is, lost, in, the, damaged, portion, of, the, inscription, the, third, name, ends, in, ga, and, is, generally, restored, as, ganapati, naga, because, achyuta, nandin, presumably, same, as, achyuta, nagasena, and, ganapati, naga, are, once, again, mentioned, in, the, later, part, of, the, inscription, among, the, kings, of, aryavarta, northern, india, defeated, by, samudragupta, these, kings, are, identified, as, the, rulers, of, present, day, western, uttar, pradesh, see, below, according, to, the, inscription, samudragupta, reinstated, these, rulers, after, they, sought, his, forgiveness, it, is, not, clear, why, the, names, of, these, three, kings, is, repeated, later, in, the, inscription, according, to, one, theory, these, three, kings, were, vassal, rulers, who, rebelled, against, samudragupta, after, the, death, of, his, father, samudragupta, crushed, the, rebellion, and, reinstated, them, after, they, sought, his, forgiveness, later, these, rulers, rebelled, once, more, and, samudragupta, defeated, them, again, another, possibility, is, that, the, author, of, the, inscription, thought, it, necessary, to, repeat, these, names, while, describing, samudragupta, s, later, conquests, in, aryavarta, simply, because, these, kings, belonged, to, that, region, samudragupta, dispatched, an, army, to, capture, the, scion, of, the, kota, family, whose, identity, is, uncertain, the, kotas, may, have, been, the, rulers, of, present, day, punjab, where, coins, bearing, the, legend, kota, and, featuring, a, symbol, of, shiva, and, his, bull, have, been, discovered, the, inscription, states, that, the, gupta, army, captured, the, kota, ruler, while, samudragupta, himself, played, or, pleased, himself, in, a, city, called, pushpa, the, name, pushpa, pura, referred, to, pataliputra, at, samudragupta, s, time, although, it, came, to, be, used, for, kanyakubja, in, the, later, period, modern, scholars, have, interpreted, the, word, played, in, various, ways, according, to, one, theory, this, portion, describes, samudragupta, s, achievements, as, a, prince, an, alternative, interpretation, is, that, samudragupta, dispatched, his, army, on, these, campaigns, while, he, himself, stayed, at, the, capital, it, is, also, possible, that, the, poet, intended, to, convey, that, these, campaigns, were, minor, affairs, that, did, not, require, the, king, s, direct, involvement, at, the, battlefront, according, to, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, samudragupta, captured, and, later, released, the, following, kings, of, dakshinapatha, the, southern, region, the, exact, identification, of, several, of, these, kings, is, debated, among, modern, scholars, but, it, is, clear, that, these, kings, ruled, areas, located, on, the, eastern, coast, of, india, samudragupta, most, probably, passed, through, the, forest, tract, of, central, india, reached, the, eastern, coast, in, present, day, odisha, and, then, marched, south, along, the, coast, of, bay, of, bengal, the, inscription, states, that, samudragupta, later, released, these, kings, and, favoured, anugraha, them, most, modern, scholars, theorize, that, samudragupta, reinstated, these, rulers, as, his, tributaries, m, g, s, narayanan, interprets, the, word, anugraha, differently, based, on, its, occurrence, in, the, arthashastra, he, theorizes, that, samudragupta, gave, protection, and, aid, to, these, kingdoms, in, order, to, secure, their, alliances, some, scholars, such, as, j, dubreuil, and, b, v, krishnarao, theorized, that, samudragupta, only, advanced, up, to, the, krishna, river, and, was, forced, to, retreat, without, fighting, a, battle, when, the, southern, kings, formed, a, strong, confederacy, to, oppose, him, according, to, these, scholars, the, claim, that, samudragupta, released, these, kings, is, an, attempt, by, samudragupta, s, courtier, to, cover, up, the, emperor, s, failure, however, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, southern, kings, forming, a, confederacy, against, samudragupta, historian, ashvini, agrawal, notes, that, setting, free, a, captured, king, is, inline, with, the, ancient, indian, political, ideals, for, example, kautilya, defines, three, types, of, conquerors, the, righteous, conqueror, dharma, vijayi, who, restores, the, defeated, king, in, exchange, for, his, acknowledgment, of, the, conqueror, s, suzerainty, the, covetous, conqueror, lobha, vijayi, who, takes, away, the, possessions, of, the, defeated, king, but, spares, his, life, and, the, demoniac, conqueror, asura, vijayi, who, annexes, the, territory, of, the, defeated, king, and, kills, him, such, political, ideals, existed, in, the, gupta, period, too, as, evident, from, kalidasa, s, statement, in, raghuvamsha, that, the, righteous, victorious, monarch, raghu, only, took, away, the, royal, glory, of, the, lord, of, mahendra, who, had, been, captured, and, released, but, not, his, kingdom, therefore, it, is, likely, that, samudragupta, acted, like, a, righteous, conqueror, and, restored, the, defeated, kings, as, his, vassals, according, to, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, samudragupta, forcibly, uprooted, the, following, kings, of, aryavarta, the, northern, region, unlike, the, southern, kings, the, inscription, does, not, mention, the, territories, ruled, by, these, kings, which, suggests, that, their, kingdoms, were, annexed, to, the, gupta, empire, the, inscription, also, mentions, that, samudragupta, defeated, some, other, kings, but, does, not, mention, their, names, presumably, because, the, poet, saw, them, as, unimportant, according, to, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, samudragupta, reduced, all, the, kings, of, the, forest, region, atavika, to, subservience, this, forest, region, may, have, been, located, in, central, india, the, inscriptions, of, the, parivrajaka, dynasty, which, ruled, in, this, area, state, that, their, ancestral, kingdom, was, located, within, the, 18, forest, kingdoms, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, mentions, that, rulers, of, several, frontier, kingdoms, and, tribal, oligarchies, paid, samudragupta, tributes, obeyed, his, orders, and, performed, obeisance, before, him, the, inscription, explicitly, describes, the, five, kingdoms, as, frontier, territories, the, areas, controlled, by, the, tribes, were, also, probably, located, at, the, frontier, of, samudrgupta, s, kingdom, samudragupta, whose, formidable, rule, was, propitiated, with, the, payment, of, all, tributes, execution, of, orders, and, visits, to, his, court, for, obeisance, by, such, frontier, rulers, as, those, of, samata, a, av, ka, k, mar, pa, n, p, la, and, kart, ipura, and, by, the, m, lavas, rjun, yanas, yaudh, yas, m, drakas, bh, ras, pr, rjunas, sanak, n, kas, k, kas, kharaparikas, and, other, nations, historian, upinder, singh, theorizes, that, the, relationship, of, these, frontier, rulers, to, the, gupta, emperor, had, certain, elements, of, a, feudatory, relationship, according, to, historian, r, c, majumdar, it, is, likely, that, samudragupta, s, conquests, in, aryavarta, and, dakshinapatha, increased, his, reputation, to, such, an, extent, that, the, frontier, rulers, and, tribes, submitted, him, without, a, fight, the, frontier, kingdoms, included, the, tribal, oligarchies, included, samudragupta, s, inscription, mentions, that, several, kings, tried, to, please, him, by, attending, on, him, personally, offering, him, their, daughters, in, marriage, or, according, to, another, interpretation, gifting, him, maidens, and, seeking, the, use, of, the, garuda, depicting, gupta, seal, for, administering, their, own, territories, these, kings, included, daivaputra, shahi, shahanushahi, shaka, murundas, and, the, rulers, of, the, island, countries, such, as, simhala, numismatist, john, allan, theorized, that, daivaputra, shahi, and, shahanushahi, were, three, different, states, or, alternatively, shahi, shahanushahi, was, a, single, state, historian, d, r, bhandarkar, argued, that, daivaputra, a, descendant, of, devaputra, cannot, be, a, stand, alone, name, and, identified, daivaputra, shahi, shahanushahi, as, a, single, ruler, possibly, kidara, i, who, had, established, a, new, kingdom, gandhara, present, day, afghanistan, according, to, historian, tej, ram, sharma, daivaputra, refers, to, a, kushan, king, devaputra, being, a, kushan, title, shahi, refers, to, a, sub, branch, of, the, kushans, and, shahanushahi, refers, to, the, sasanians, these, kings, controlled, parts, of, present, day, punjab, and, afghanistan, historian, ashvini, agrwal, theorizes, that, kidara, who, initially, ruled, as, a, vassal, of, the, sasanian, king, shapur, ii, may, have, formed, an, alliance, with, samudragupta, to, overthrow, his, sasanian, overlord, in, raghuvamsha, the, gupta, court, poet, kalidasa, states, his, hero, raghu, defeated, the, parasikas, persians, agrwal, speculates, that, this, description, may, be, inspired, from, the, kidraite, gupta, victory, over, the, sasanians, according, to, abraham, eraly, and, others, the, expression, devaputra, sh, hi, sh, h, nu, sh, hi, evidently, designates, the, kushan, princes, being, a, deformation, of, the, kushan, regnal, titles, devaputra, shao, and, shaonanoshao, son, of, god, king, king, of, kings, this, suggests, that, by, the, time, of, the, allahabad, inscription, the, kushans, still, ruled, in, punjab, but, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, gupta, emperor, according, to, hans, t, bakker, candidates, for, the, daivaputras, hi, are, the, late, kushan, kings, of, gandh, ra, vasudeva, ii, or, kipunadha, and, regarding, the, aka, murunda, i, follow, konow, and, l, ders, who, argue, that, this, passage, in, the, allahabad, inscription, of, samudragupta, leaves, no, doubt, that, murunda, i, e, commander, originally, was, a, title, used, by, saka, princes, the, h, nu, hi, refers, to, the, king, of, kings, shapur, ii, according, to, s, r, goyal, samudragupta, was, determined, to, ensure, the, safety, of, the, empire, s, frontiers, and, secure, the, western, trade, routes, to, address, these, concerns, he, formed, an, alliance, with, kidara, a, strategic, move, aimed, at, countering, the, threats, posed, by, shapur, ii, of, the, sassanian, empire, as, the, more, powerful, partner, in, this, alliance, samudragupta, provided, significant, support, to, kidara, this, collaboration, proved, to, be, highly, effective, kidara, achieved, victories, over, the, sassanians, in, 367, 368, ad, however, these, victories, did, not, necessarily, result, in, shapur, ii, becoming, a, vassal, of, either, kidara, or, samudragupta, some, scholars, believe, that, the, term, shaka, murundas, refers, to, a, single, entity, for, example, scholars, such, as, sten, konow, assert, that, murunda, is, a, shaka, title, meaning, lord, the, kushans, also, used, similar, titles, for, example, kanishka, is, titled, a, muroda, in, his, zeda, inscription, other, scholars, such, as, k, p, jayaswal, believe, that, shakas, and, murundas, are, two, different, groups, of, people, according, to, this, theory, shakas, here, most, probably, refers, to, the, western, kshatrapa, rulers, of, ujjain, jayaswal, notes, that, the, puranas, mention, the, rule, of, 13, murunda, kings, and, hemachandra, s, abhidhana, chintamani, describes, murunda, as, people, of, lampaka, in, present, day, afghanistan, however, agrwal, points, out, that, these, sources, are, of, relatively, late, origin, and, it, is, possible, that, a, branch, of, the, shakas, had, come, to, be, known, as, murundas, the, exact, location, of, the, shakas, mentioned, in, samudragupta, s, inscription, is, not, certain, v, a, smith, identified, them, with, the, western, kshatrapas, who, controlled, the, western, malwa, and, saurashtra, regions, d, r, bhandarkar, alternatively, identified, the, shaka, murunda, ruler, with, shridhara, varman, a, shaka, ruler, whose, inscriptions, have, been, discovered, at, sanchi, kanakerha, inscription, and, eran, eran, then, came, under, the, direct, control, of, samudragupta, as, attested, by, his, eran, inscription, according, to, the, chinese, sources, meghavarna, the, king, of, simhala, present, day, sri, lanka, sought, to, build, a, monastery, at, bodh, gaya, for, the, convenience, of, the, pilgrims, from, his, kingdom, he, sent, rich, presents, for, this, purpose, and, samudragupta, sanctioned, his, request, to, build, the, monastery, using, poetic, exaggeration, samudragupta, s, courtier, harishena, appears, to, have, described, this, act, of, diplomacy, as, an, act, of, subservience, similarly, the, 7th, century, chinese, traveler, xuanzang, who, visited, this, monastery, appears, to, have, regarded, the, rich, presents, sent, by, meghavarna, as, tribute, he, states, that, meghavarna, gave, in, tribute, to, the, king, of, india, all, the, jewels, of, his, country, the, other, islands, may, be, the, indianized, kingdoms, of, south, east, asia, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, their, rulers, were, subordinate, to, samudragupta, they, probably, sent, embassies, to, the, gupta, empire, and, maintained, friendly, relations, the, sea, ports, of, the, gupta, empire, such, as, tamralipti, were, probably, connected, to, these, kingdoms, through, the, marine, routes, the, widespread, use, of, sanskrit, in, these, kingdoms, may, have, happened, as, a, result, of, gupta, influence, samudragupta, s, empire, included, a, core, territory, located, in, northern, india, which, was, directly, controlled, by, the, emperor, besides, it, comprised, a, number, of, monarchical, and, tribal, tributary, states, historian, r, c, majumdar, theorizes, that, samudragupta, directly, controlled, an, area, extending, from, the, ravi, river, punjab, in, the, west, to, the, brahmaputra, river, bengal, and, assam, in, the, east, and, from, the, himalayan, foothills, in, the, north, to, the, vindhya, hills, in, the, south, the, south, western, boundary, of, his, territory, roughly, followed, an, imaginary, line, drawn, from, present, day, karnal, to, bhilsa, in, the, south, samudragupta, s, empire, definitely, included, eran, in, present, day, madhya, pradesh, where, his, inscription, has, been, found, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, suggests, that, he, advanced, up, to, kanchipuram, in, the, south, however, since, the, claims, in, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, are, from, a, royal, eulogy, they, must, be, treated, with, caution, the, southern, kings, were, not, under, his, direct, suzerainty, they, only, paid, him, tribute, according, to, historian, kunal, chakrabarti, samudragupta, s, military, campaigns, weakened, the, tribal, republics, of, present, day, punjab, and, rajasthan, but, even, these, kingdoms, were, not, under, his, direct, suzerainty, they, only, paid, him, tribute, samudragupta, s, claim, of, control, over, other, kings, is, questionable, historian, ashvini, agrawal, notes, that, a, gold, coin, of, the, gadahara, tribe, bears, the, legend, samudra, which, suggests, that, samudragupta, s, control, extended, up, to, the, chenab, river, in, the, punjab, region, some, earlier, scholars, such, as, j, f, fleet, believed, that, samudragupta, had, also, conquered, a, part, of, maharashtra, based, on, the, identification, of, devarashtra, with, maharashtra, and, erandapalla, with, erandol, where, some, gupta, era, remains, have, been, found, however, this, theory, is, no, longer, considered, correct, the, coinage, of, the, gupta, empire, was, initially, derived, from, the, coinage, of, the, kushan, empire, adopting, its, weight, standard, techniques, and, designs, following, the, conquests, of, samudragupta, in, the, northwest, of, the, subcontinent, the, guptas, even, adopted, from, the, kushans, the, name, of, dinara, for, their, coinage, which, ultimately, came, from, the, roman, name, denarius, aureus, the, standard, coin, type, of, samudragupta, is, highly, similar, to, the, coinage, of, the, later, kushan, rulers, including, the, sacrificial, scene, over, an, altar, the, depiction, of, a, halo, while, differences, include, the, headdress, of, the, ruler, a, close, fitting, cap, instead, of, the, kushan, pointed, hat, the, garuda, standard, instead, of, the, trident, and, samudragupta, s, jewelry, which, is, indian, the, following, types, of, samudragupta, s, coins, inscribed, with, sanskrit, language, legends, have, been, discovered, various, scholars, including, numismatist, john, allan, consider, that, the, gold, coins, bearing, the, portraits, of, chandragupta, and, kumaradevi, were, issued, by, samudragupta, to, commemorate, his, parents, while, others, have, attributed, the, issue, of, these, coins, to, chandragupta, himself, two, inscriptions, from, samudragupta, s, reign, have, been, discovered, fleet, theorized, that, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, was, posthumous, and, was, issued, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, but, modern, scholars, disagree, with, this, theory, two, other, records, are, attributed, to, samudragupta, s, reign, but, the, genuineness, of, these, records, is, disputed, both, these, inscriptions, state, that, they, were, written, at, the, order, of, the, gupta, officer, gopaswamin, like, the, mathura, stone, inscription, of, chandragupta, ii, these, records, describe, samudragupta, as, the, restorer, of, the, ashvamedha, sacrifice, it, seems, suspicious, that, records, issued, so, early, in, samudragupta, s, reign, mention, this, claim, which, does, not, appear, in, the, later, allahabad, pillar, inscription, one, possibility, is, that, these, records, were, issued, during, samudragupta, s, reign, and, were, damaged, after, some, time, because, of, which, they, were, restored, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, at, eran, an, inscription, by, samudragupta, seems, to, succeed, that, of, a, local, saka, ruler, named, sridharavarman, already, known, from, the, kanakerha, inscription, at, sanchi, and, another, inscription, in, eran, samudragupta, may, therefore, have, ousted, sridharavarman, in, his, campaigns, to, the, west, the, eran,

samudragputa, s, eran, inscription, records, the, installation, of, a, vishnu, idol, in, a, temple, the, nalanda, and, gaya, inscriptions, attributed, to, samudragupta, explicitly, call, him, a, devotee, of, vishnu, parama, bhagavata, he, was, also, tolerant, towards, buddhism, and, permitted, the, construction, of, a, buddhist, monastery, commissioned, by, the, anuradhapura, king, meghavarna, at, bodh, gaya, in, his, territory, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, states, that, samudragupta, was, engaged, in, the, performance, of, the, brahmanical, ceremonies, of, sattra, soma, sacrifices, and, diksha, it, describes, him, as, the, giver, of, many, hundreds, of, thousands, of, cows, the, mathura, stone, inscription, of, his, son, chandragupta, ii, also, describes, him, as, the, giver, of, millions, of, cows, and, gold, it, appears, that, samudragupta, donated, these, cows, to, the, brahmins, who, officiated, his, sattra, and, diksha, ceremonies, the, eran, inscription, states, that, samudragupta, surpassed, prithu, raghava, and, other, legendary, kings, in, giving, gold, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, alludes, to, his, divine, kingship, comparing, him, to, the, parama, purusha, supreme, being, and, also, with, deities, such, as, dhanada, kubera, varuna, indra, and, antaka, yama, the, eran, inscription, states, that, he, was, equal, to, kubera, and, yama, in, pleasure, and, anger, respectively, the, mathura, stone, inscription, similarly, describes, him, as, equal, to, the, deities, kubera, varuna, indra, and, yama, samudragupta, performed, the, ashvamedha, ritual, which, was, used, by, the, ancient, indian, kings, to, prove, their, imperial, sovereignty, and, issued, gold, coins, see, coinage, section, to, mark, this, performance, the, copper, plate, inscriptions, of, samudragupta, s, granddaughter, prabhavati, gupta, who, was, a, vakataka, queen, describe, him, as, the, performer, of, multiple, horse, sacrifices, according, to, one, theory, samudragupta, indeed, performed, more, than, one, horse, sacrifices, as, attested, by, the, presence, of, two, different, legends, on, his, ashvamedha, coins, another, theory, dismisses, the, claim, on, prabhavati, gupta, s, inscriptions, as, an, exaggeration, or, a, scribal, error, since, this, claim, does, not, appear, on, the, inscriptions, of, samudragupta, or, his, successors, the, mathura, stone, inscription, of, chandragupta, ii, describes, samudragupta, as, the, restorer, of, the, ashvamedha, sacrifice, that, had, been, long, in, abeyance, smith, s, translation, this, claim, also, appears, in, the, inscriptions, of, the, subsequent, gupta, kings, as, well, as, the, spurious, gaya, and, nalanda, inscriptions, attributed, to, samudragupta, however, several, kings, including, those, from, bharashiva, vakataka, shalankayana, and, pallava, dynasties, had, had, performed, ashvamedha, in, the, preceding, years, different, scholars, have, attempted, to, explain, this, anomaly, in, different, ways, h, c, raychaudhuri, suggests, that, the, gupta, court, poet, did, not, know, about, these, kings, according, to, r, c, majumdar, samudragupta, was, the, first, king, several, centuries, to, perform, the, sacrifice, in, the, magadha, region, majumdar, also, theorizes, that, the, ashvamedha, ceremony, performed, by, bharashiva, vakataka, and, other, near, contemporary, kings, was, more, of, a, religious, nature, while, samudragupta, s, ceremony, actually, involved, proving, his, imperial, sovereignty, similarly, scholars, such, as, s, k, aiyangar, and, d, r, bhandarkar, theorize, that, unlike, the, other, kings, samudragupta, performed, a, full, fledged, ashvamedha, ceremony, others, such, as, v, s, pathak, and, jagannath, agrawal, interpret, the, verse, to, mean, that, samudragupta, performed, the, horse, ritual, that, lasted, for, a, long, time, the, surviving, verses, of, samudragupta, s, own, allahabad, pillar, inscription, do, not, mention, the, ashvamedha, ceremony, according, to, one, theory, this, inscription, was, put, up, to, mark, the, beginning, of, the, ceremony, as, the, panegyrics, of, the, sacrificer, were, an, essential, part, of, the, ashvamedha, ceremony, it, is, possible, that, its, first, four, lines, which, are, now, lost, contained, a, reference, to, the, ceremony, samudragupta, s, coins, depict, him, as, a, man, of, tall, stature, and, muscular, physique, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, presents, him, as, a, compassionate, ruler, stating, that, his, mind, was, engaged, in, providing, relief, to, the, low, the, poor, the, helpless, and, the, afflicted, it, also, mentions, that, he, reinstated, many, royal, families, which, had, lost, their, kingdoms, including, the, kings, defeated, by, him, at, the, same, time, it, states, that, he, maintained, strict, administration, prachanda, shasana, the, inscription, states, that, samudragupta, became, famous, among, the, learned, people, because, of, his, poetical, works, and, earned, the, epithet, king, of, poets, this, suggests, that, he, composed, some, poetical, works, but, none, of, these, works, now, survive, the, inscription, also, boasts, that, samudragupta, put, to, shame, the, celestial, musician, tumburu, and, narada, by, his, lovely, performances, of, music, samudragupta, s, musical, talents, are, also, corroborated, by, his, gold, coins, which, depict, him, playing, a, veena, the, inscription, praises, samudragupta, s, wisdom, and, intellect, stating, that, he, put, to, shame, the, preceptor, of, the, lord, of, the, gods, that, is, brihaspati, by, his, sharp, intellect, vincent, smith, referred, to, samudragupta, as, the, indian, napoleon, due, to, his, remarkable, military, campaigns, and, strategic, prowess, his, achievements, included, the, total, defeat, of, adversaries, in, aryavarta, extensive, expeditions, in, the, deccan, across, long, distances, and, inhospitable, terrains, and, a, notable, expedition, across, the, indus, river, this, last, expedition, which, might, have, been, led, by, samudragupta, himself, or, his, son, chandragupta, ii, demonstrated, his, exceptional, military, skill, and, strategic, acumen, the, comparison, between, samudragupta, and, napoleon, is, relevant, in, several, aspects, both, rulers, organized, their, empires, in, a, broadly, similar, fashion, napoleon, s, empire, centered, around, france, and, including, adjacent, dutch, belgian, german, and, italian, regions, was, surrounded, by, a, network, of, allied, and, protected, states, such, as, spain, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, the, grand, duchy, of, warsaw, and, the, kingdoms, of, italy, and, naples, similarly, samudragupta, s, empire, encompassed, nearly, all, of, northern, india, excluding, regions, like, sindh, much, of, kashmir, and, western, rajasthan, samudragupta, s, empire, was, vast, and, strategically, organized, it, encompassed, nearly, the, whole, of, modern, uttar, pradesh, bihar, part, of, bengal, and, a, significant, portion, of, eastern, malwa, beyond, a, ring, of, tributary, states, were, the, saka, and, kusha, principalities, in, the, north, west, twelve, states, in, the, deccan, kerala, as, well, as, simhala, sri, lanka, and, several, other, islands, these, regions, were, either, allies, or, were, compelled, to, show, respect, towards, the, empire, forming, a, second, line, of, defense, beyond, the, primary, ring, of, tributary, states, samudragupta, s, imperial, structure, resembled, that, of, napoleon, s, organizational, strategy, featuring, a, strong, central, core, surrounded, by, friendly, states, and, dependencies, like, napoleon, samudragupta, was, influenced, by, the, prevailing, ideologies, of, his, time, his, allahabad, prasasti, inscription, reflects, his, aspiration, for, chakravartitva, or, universal, sovereignty, a, hindu, ideal, prevalent, during, the, gupta, era, which, sought, to, establish, overlordship, over, all, of, bharatavarsha, india, this, ideal, can, be, compared, to, napoleon, s, vision, of, a, european, commonwealth, under, french, hegemony, unlike, napoleon, whose, ambitions, were, curtailed, after, the, battle, of, waterloo, samudragupta, successfully, realized, his, vision, and, celebrated, his, achievements, with, the, performance, of, an, asvamedha, horse, sacrifice, the, asvamedha, performed, by, samudragupta, was, of, an, elaborate, type, denoted, by, the, term, chirotsanna, rather, than, the, abbreviated, form, that, was, more, common, during, that, period, it, is, generally, believed, that, this, grand, celebration, occurred, sometime, after, the, inscription, of, the, allahabad, prasasti, however, it, is, also, possible, that, the, asvamedha, was, conducted, around, the, same, time, as, the, inscription, it, is, believed, that, the, allahabad, prasasti, was, composed, in, conjunction, with, the, performance, of, samudragupta, s, asvamedha, sacrifice, this, elaborate, type, of, sacrifice, known, as, chirotsanna, included, prateyya, or, hymns, praising, the, sacrificer, and, long, ago, kings, performed, by, lute, players, including, a, rajanya, who, sang, three, self, composed, songs, it, is, possible, that, the, asokan, pillar, on, which, the, prasasti, was, engraved, was, used, as, an, ornamental, post, during, the, sacrifice, prayaga, modern, day, allahabad, was, the, original, seat, of, the, gupta, dynasty, samudragupta, s, reign, marked, a, significant, revival, of, brahmanical, religion, which, had, declined, since, emperor, ashoka, s, promotion, of, buddhism, samudragupta, represents, a, hindu, response, to, ashoka, s, buddhist, ideals, while, ashoka, sought, to, be, a, chakravarti, dharmika, dharmaraja, a, ruler, who, conquered, through, righteousness, dhamma, rather, than, force, samudragupta, aimed, to, be, a, traditional, chakravartin, through, military, conquest, both, emperors, were, considered, dharma, vijayins, victors, through, righteousness, but, their, concepts, of, achieving, righteousness, differed, ashoka, emphasized, the, moral, aspects, of, religion, while, samudragupta, focused, on, traditional, martial, and, political, authority, the, question, of, whether, vikramaditya, existed, or, is, a, legend, is, unresolved, however, it, is, well, established, that, samudragupta, was, the, first, historical, ruler, to, assume, the, title, of, vikrama, elements, of, the, vikramaditya, legend, can, be, traced, back, to, both, samudragupta, and, his, son, chandragupta, ii, reflecting, their, personalities, and, achievements, according, to, a, roman, historian, an, indian, embassy, arrived, in, rome, in, 351, a, d, although, it, had, been, dispatched, from, india, earlier, this, event, holds, historical, significance, when, viewed, in, the, context, of, the, political, conditions, in, india, during, the, mid, fourth, century, ad, before, 361, a, d, rome, was, at, war, with, the, sassanian, empire, during, this, period, it, was, plausible, that, samudragupta, a, prominent, indian, ruler, might, have, sought, to, support, roman, efforts, against, the, sassanians, by, sending, an, embassy, by, aligning, with, kid, ra, against, shapur, ii, samudragupta, would, have, aimed, to, keep, sassanian, forces, occupied, and, distracted, in, light, of, the, political, dynamics, in, bactria, and, north, western, india, there, is, a, suggestion, that, kalidasa, s, portrayal, of, raghu, s, conquests, in, his, work, raghuva, a, might, be, based, on, the, actual, historical, events, of, samudragupta, s, campaigns, kalidasa, describes, raghu, s, military, expeditions, including, the, conquest, of, trik, ta, in, the, deccan, and, subsequent, campaigns, against, the, parasikas, hunas, and, kambojas, kalidasa, s, epic, therefore, might, reflect, the, real, historical, interactions, and, conflicts, of, the, time, providing, a, literary, perspective, on, the, political, and, military, landscape, of, the, era, the, official, records, of, the, gupta, dynasty, state, that, samudragupta, was, succeeded, by, chandragupta, ii, who, was, his, son, from, dattadevi, based, on, a, reconstruction, of, the, partially, lost, sanskrit, play, devichandraguptam, a, section, of, modern, historians, believe, that, samudragupta, was, initially, succeeded, by, ramagupta, presumably, the, eldest, son, who, was, then, dethroned, by, chandragupta, ii
