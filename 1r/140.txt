pierre, auguste, renoir, r, n, w, r, french, 25, february, 1841, 3, december, 1919, was, a, french, artist, who, was, a, leading, painter, in, the, development, of, the, impressionist, style, as, a, celebrator, of, beauty, and, especially, feminine, sensuality, it, has, been, said, that, renoir, is, the, final, representative, of, a, tradition, which, runs, directly, from, rubens, to, watteau, he, was, the, father, of, actor, pierre, renoir, 1885, 1952, filmmaker, jean, renoir, 1894, 1979, and, ceramic, artist, claude, renoir, 1901, 1969, he, was, the, grandfather, of, the, filmmaker, claude, renoir, 1913, 1993, son, of, pierre, pierre, auguste, renoir, was, born, in, limoges, haute, vienne, france, in, 1841, his, father, l, onard, renoir, was, a, tailor, of, modest, means, so, in, 1844, renoir, s, family, moved, to, paris, in, search, of, more, favorable, prospects, the, location, of, their, home, in, rue, d, argenteuil, in, central, paris, placed, renoir, in, proximity, to, the, louvre, although, the, young, renoir, had, a, natural, proclivity, for, drawing, he, exhibited, a, greater, talent, for, singing, his, talent, was, encouraged, by, his, teacher, charles, gounod, who, was, the, choirmaster, at, the, church, of, st, roch, at, the, time, however, due, to, the, family, s, financial, circumstances, renoir, had, to, discontinue, his, music, lessons, and, leave, school, at, the, age, of, thirteen, to, pursue, an, apprenticeship, at, a, porcelain, factory, although, renoir, displayed, a, talent, for, his, work, he, frequently, tired, of, the, subject, matter, and, sought, refuge, in, the, galleries, of, the, louvre, the, owner, of, the, factory, recognized, his, apprentice, s, talent, and, communicated, this, to, renoir, s, family, following, this, renoir, started, taking, lessons, to, prepare, for, entry, into, ecole, des, beaux, arts, when, the, porcelain, factory, adopted, mechanical, reproduction, processes, in, 1858, renoir, was, forced, to, find, other, means, to, support, his, learning, before, he, enrolled, in, art, school, he, also, painted, hangings, for, overseas, missionaries, and, decorations, on, fans, in, 1862, he, began, studying, art, under, charles, gleyre, in, paris, there, he, met, alfred, sisley, fr, d, ric, bazille, and, claude, monet, at, times, during, the, 1860s, he, did, not, have, enough, money, to, buy, paint, renoir, had, his, first, success, at, the, salon, of, 1868, with, his, painting, lise, with, a, parasol, 1867, which, depicted, lise, tr, hot, his, lover, at, the, time, although, renoir, first, started, exhibiting, paintings, at, the, paris, salon, in, 1864, recognition, was, slow, in, coming, partly, as, a, result, of, the, turmoil, of, the, franco, prussian, war, during, the, paris, commune, in, 1871, while, renoir, painted, on, the, banks, of, the, seine, river, some, communards, thought, he, was, a, spy, and, were, about, to, throw, him, into, the, river, when, a, leader, of, the, commune, raoul, rigault, recognized, renoir, as, the, man, who, had, protected, him, on, an, earlier, occasion, in, 1874, a, ten, year, friendship, with, jules, le, c, ur, and, his, family, ended, and, renoir, lost, not, only, the, valuable, support, gained, by, the, association, but, also, a, generous, welcome, to, stay, on, their, property, near, fontainebleau, and, its, scenic, forest, this, loss, of, a, favorite, painting, location, resulted, in, a, distinct, change, of, subjects, renoir, was, inspired, by, the, style, and, subject, matter, of, previous, modern, painters, camille, pissarro, and, douard, manet, after, a, series, of, rejections, by, the, salon, juries, he, joined, forces, with, monet, sisley, pissarro, and, several, other, artists, to, mount, the, first, impressionist, exhibition, in, april, 1874, in, which, renoir, displayed, six, paintings, although, the, critical, response, to, the, exhibition, was, largely, unfavorable, renoir, s, work, was, comparatively, well, received, that, same, year, two, of, his, works, were, shown, with, durand, ruel, in, london, hoping, to, secure, a, livelihood, by, attracting, portrait, commissions, renoir, displayed, mostly, portraits, at, the, second, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1876, he, contributed, a, more, diverse, range, of, paintings, the, next, year, when, the, group, presented, its, third, exhibition, they, included, dance, at, le, moulin, de, la, galette, and, the, swing, renoir, did, not, exhibit, in, the, fourth, or, fifth, impressionist, exhibitions, and, instead, resumed, submitting, his, works, to, the, salon, by, the, end, of, the, 1870s, particularly, after, the, success, of, his, painting, mme, charpentier, and, her, children, 1878, at, the, salon, of, 1879,

in, his, hands, and, ankylosis, of, his, right, shoulder, requiring, him, to, change, his, painting, technique, it, has, often, been, reported, that, in, the, advanced, stages, of, his, arthritis, he, painted, by, having, a, brush, strapped, to, his, paralyzed, fingers, but, this, is, erroneous, renoir, remained, able, to, grasp, a, brush, although, he, required, an, assistant, to, place, it, in,

arts, and, cultural, center, in, hendersonville, tennessee, hosted, beauty, remains, an, exhibition, of, his, works, the, exhibition, title, comes, from, a, famous, quote, by, pierre, auguste, who, when, asked, why, he, continued, to, paint, with, his, painful, arthritis, in, his, advanced, years, once, said, the, pain, passes, but, the, beauty, remains, renoir, s, paintings, are, notable, for, their, vibrant, light, and, saturated, color, most, often, focusing, on, people, in, intimate, and, candid, compositions, the, female, nude, was, one, of, his, primary, subjects, however, in, 1876, a, reviewer, in, le, figaro, wrote, try, to, explain, to, monsieur, renoir, that, a, woman, s, torso, is, not, a, mass, of, decomposing, flesh, with, those, purplish, green, stains, that, denote, a, state, of, complete, putrefaction, in, a, corpse, yet, in, characteristic, impressionist, style, renoir, suggested, the, details, of, a, scene, through, freely, brushed, touches, of, colour, so, that, his, figures, softly, fuse, with, one, another, and, their, surroundings, his, initial, paintings, show, the, influence, of, the, colorism, of, eug, ne, delacroix, and, the, luminosity, of, camille, corot, he, also, admired, the, realism, of, gustave, courbet, and, douard, manet, and, his, early, work, resembles, theirs, in, his, use, of, black, as, a, color, renoir, admired, edgar, degas, sense, of, movement, other, painters, renoir, greatly, admired, were, the, 18th, century, masters, fran, ois, boucher, and, jean, honor, fragonard, a, fine, example, of, renoir, s, early, work, and, evidence, of, the, influence, of, courbet, s, realism, is, diana, 1867, ostensibly, a, mythological, subject, the, painting, is, a, naturalistic, studio, work, the, figure, carefully, observed, solidly, modeled, and, superimposed, upon, a, contrived, landscape, if, the, work, is, a, student, piece, renoir, s, heightened, personal, response, to, female, sensuality, is, present, the, model, was, lise, tr, hot, the, artist, s, mistress, at, that, time, and, inspiration, for, a, number, of, paintings, in, the, late, 1860s, through, the, practice, of, painting, light, and, water, en, plein, air, outdoors, he, and, his, friend, claude, monet, discovered, that, the, color, of, shadows, is, not, brown, or, black, but, the, reflected, color, of, the, objects, surrounding, them, an, effect, known, today, as, diffuse, reflection, several, pairs, of, paintings, exist, in, which, renoir, and, monet, worked, side, by, side, depicting, the, same, scenes, la, grenouill, re, 1869, one, of, the, best, known, impressionist, works, is, renoir, s, 1876, dance, at, le, moulin, de, la, galette, bal, du, moulin, de, la, galette, the, painting, depicts, an, open, air, scene, crowded, with, people, at, a, popular, dance, garden, on, the, butte, montmartre, close, to, where, he, lived, the, works, of, his, early, maturity, were, typically, impressionist, snapshots, of, real, life, full, of, sparkling, color, and, light, by, the, mid, 1880s, however, he, had, broken, with, the, movement, to, apply, a, more, disciplined, formal, technique, to, portraits, and, figure, paintings, particularly, of, women, it, was, a, trip, to, italy, in, 1881, when, he, saw, works, by, raphael, leonardo, da, vinci, titian, and, other, renaissance, masters, that, convinced, him, that, he, was, on, the, wrong, path, at, that, point, he, declared, i, had, gone, as, far, as, i, could, with, impressionism, and, i, realized, i, could, neither, paint, nor, draw, for, the, next, several, years, he, painted, in, a, more, severe, style, in, an, attempt, to, return, to, classicism, concentrating, on, his, drawing, and, emphasizing, the, outlines, of, figures, he, painted, works, such, as, blonde, bather, 1881, and, 1882, and, the, large, bathers, 1884, 87, philadelphia, museum, of, art, during, what, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, his, ingres, period, after, 1890, he, changed, direction, again, to, dissolve, outlines, as, in, his, earlier, work, he, returned, to, thinly, brushed, color, from, this, period, onward, he, concentrated, on, monumental, nudes, and, domestic, scenes, fine, examples, of, which, are, girls, at, the, piano, 1892, and, grandes, baigneuses, 1887, the, latter, painting, is, the, most, typical, and, successful, of, renoir, s, late, abundantly, fleshed, nudes, a, prolific, artist, he, created, several, thousand, paintings, the, warm, sensuality, of, renoir, s, style, made, his, paintings, some, of, the, most, well, known, and, frequently, reproduced, works, in, the, history, of, art, the, single, largest, collection, of, his, works, 181, paintings, in, all, is, at, the, barnes, foundation, in, philadelphia, a, five, volume, catalogue,
