zaleski, and, stefan, witwicki, chopin, s, final, conservatory, report, july, 1829, read, chopin, f, third, year, student, exceptional, talent, musical, genius, in, 1829, the, artist, ambro, y, mieroszewski, executed, a, set, of, portraits, of, chopin, family, members, including, the, first, known, portrait, of, the, composer, letters, from, chopin, to, woyciechowski, in, the, period, 1829, 30, when, chopin, was, about, twenty, contain, apparent, homoerotic, references, to, dreams, and, to, offered, kisses, i, am, going, to, wash, now, don, t, kiss, me, i, m, not, washed, yet, you, if, i, were, smeared, with, the, oils, of, byzantium, you, would, not, kiss, me, unless, i, forced, you, to, it, by, magnetism, there, s, some, kind, of, power, in, nature, today, you, will, dream, of, kissing, me, i, have, got, to, pay, you, out, for, the, horrible, dream, you, gave, me, last, night, according, to, adam, zamoyski, such, expressions, were, and, to, some, extent, still, are, common, currency, in, polish, and, carry, no, greater, implication, than, the, love, concluding, letters, today, the, spirit, of, the, times, pervaded, by, the, romantic, movement, in, art, and, literature, favoured, extreme, expression, of, feeling, whilst, the, possibility, cannot, be, ruled, out, entirely, it, is, unlikely, that, the, two, were, ever, lovers, chopin, s, biographer, alan, walker, considers, that, insofar, as, such, expressions, could, be, perceived, as, homosexual, in, nature, they, would, not, denote, more, than, a, passing, phase, in, chopin, s, life, or, be, the, result, in, walker, s, words, of, a, mental, twist, the, musicologist, jeffrey, kallberg, notes, that, concepts, of, sexual, practice, and, identity, were, very, different, in, chopin, s, time, so, modern, interpretation, is, problematic, other, scholars, argue, that, these, are, clear, or, potential, demonstrations, of, homosexual, impulses, on, chopin, s, part, probably, in, early, 1829, chopin, met, the, singer, konstancja, g, adkowska, and, developed, an, intense, affection, for, her, although, it, is, not, clear, that, he, ever, addressed, her, directly, on, the, matter, in, a, letter, to, woyciechowski, of, 3, october, 1829, he, refers, to, his, ideal, whom, i, have, served, faithfully, for, six, months, though, without, ever, saying, a, word, to, her, about, my, feelings, whom, i, dream, of, who, inspired, the, adagio, of, my, concerto, all, of, chopin, s, biographers, following, the, lead, of, frederick, niecks, agree, that, this, ideal, was, g, adkowska, after, what, would, be, chopin, s, farewell, concert, in, warsaw, in, october, 1830, which, included, the, concerto, played, by, the, composer, and, g, adkowska, singing, an, aria, by, gioachino, rossini, the, two, exchanged, rings, and, two, weeks, later, she, wrote, in, his, album, some, affectionate, lines, bidding, him, farewell, after, chopin, left, warsaw, he, and, g, adkowska, did, not, meet, and, apparently, did, not, correspond, in, september, 1828, chopin, while, still, a, student, visited, berlin, with, a, family, friend, zoologist, feliks, jarocki, enjoying, operas, directed, by, gaspare, spontini, and, attending, concerts, by, carl, friedrich, zelter, felix, mendelssohn, and, other, celebrities, on, an, 1829, return, trip, to, berlin, he, was, a, guest, of, prince, antoni, radziwi, governor, of, the, grand, duchy, of, posen, himself, an, accomplished, composer, and, aspiring, cellist, for, the, prince, and, his, pianist, daughter, wanda, he, composed, his, introduction, and, polonaise, brillante, in, c, major, for, cello, and, piano, op, 3, back, in, warsaw, that, year, chopin, heard, niccol, paganini, play, the, violin, and, composed, a, set, of, variations, souvenir, de, paganini, it, may, have, been, this, experience, that, encouraged, him, to, commence, writing, his, first, tudes, 1829, 1832, exploring, the, capacities, of, his, own, instrument, after, completing, his, studies, at, the, warsaw, conservatory, he, made, his, debut, in, vienna, he, gave, two, piano, concerts, and, received, many, favourable, reviews, in, addition, to, some, commenting, in, chopin, s, own, words, that, he, was, too, delicate, for, those, accustomed, to, the, piano, bashing, of, local, artists, in, the, first, of, these, concerts, he, premiered, his, variations, on, l, ci, darem, la, mano, op, 2, variations, on, a, duet, from, mozart, s, opera, don, giovanni, for, piano, and, orchestra, he, returned, to, warsaw, in, september, 1829, where, he, premiered, his, piano, concerto, no, 2, in, f, minor, op, 21, on, 17, march, 1830, chopin, s, successes, as, a, composer, and, performer, opened, the, door, to, western, europe, for, him, and, on, 2, november, 1830, he, set, out, in, the, words, of, zdzis, aw, jachimecki, into, the, wide, world, with, no, very, clearly, defined, aim, forever, with, woyciechowski, he, headed, for, austria, again, intending, to, go, on, to, italy, later, that, month, in, warsaw, the, november, 1830, uprising, broke, out, and, woyciechowski, returned, to, poland, to, enlist, chopin, now, alone, in, vienna, was, nostalgic, for, his, homeland, and, wrote, to, a, friend, i, curse, the, moment, of, my, departure, when, in, september, 1831, he, learned, while, travelling, from, vienna, to, paris, that, the, uprising, had, been, crushed, he, expressed, his, anguish, in, the, pages, of, his, private, journal, oh, god, you, are, there, and, yet, you, do, not, take, vengeance, the, journal, is, now, in, the, national, library, of, poland, jachimecki, ascribes, to, these, events, the, composer, s, maturing, into, an, inspired, national, bard, who, intuited, the, past, present, and, future, of, his, native, poland, when, he, left, warsaw, on, 2, november, 1830, chopin, had, intended, to, go, to, italy, but, violent, unrest, there, made, that, a, dangerous, destination, his, next, choice, was, paris, difficulties, obtaining, a, visa, from, russian, authorities, resulted, in, his, obtaining, transit, permission, from, the, french, in, later, years, he, would, quote, the, passport, s, endorsement, passeport, en, passant, par, paris, londres, in, transit, to, london, via, paris, joking, that, he, was, in, the, city, only, in, passing, chopin, arrived, in, paris, on, 5, october, 1831, he, would, never, return, to, poland, thus, becoming, one, of, many, expatriates, of, the, polish, great, emigration, in, france, he, used, the, french, versions, of, his, given, names, and, after, receiving, french, citizenship, in, 1835, he, travelled, on, a, french, passport, chopin, remained, close, to, his, fellow, poles, in, exile, as, friends, and, confidants, he, never, felt, fully, comfortable, speaking, french, or, considered, himself, to, be, french, despite, his, father, s, french, origins, he, always, saw, himself, as, a, pole, adam, zamoyski, wrote, in, paris, chopin, encountered, artists, and, other, distinguished, figures, and, found, many, opportunities, to, exercise, his, talents, and, achieve, celebrity, during, his, years, in, paris, he, was, to, become, acquainted, with, among, many, others, hector, berlioz, franz, liszt, ferdinand, hiller, heinrich, heine, eug, ne, delacroix, alfred, de, vigny, and, friedrich, kalkbrenner, who, introduced, him, to, the, piano, manufacturer, camille, pleyel, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, long, and, close, association, between, the, composer, and, pleyel, s, instruments, chopin, was, also, acquainted, with, the, poet, adam, mickiewicz, principal, of, the, polish, literary, society, some, of, whose, verses, he, set, as, songs, he, also, was, more, than, once, guest, of, marquis, astolphe, de, custine, one, of, his, fervent, admirers, playing, his, works, in, custine, s, salon, two, polish, friends, in, paris, were, also, to, play, important, roles, in, chopin, s, life, there, a, fellow, student, at, the, warsaw, conservatory, julian, fontana, had, originally, tried, unsuccessfully, to, establish, himself, in, england, fontana, was, to, become, in, the, words, of, the, music, historian, jim, samson, chopin, s, general, factotum, and, copyist, albert, grzyma, a, who, in, paris, became, a, wealthy, financier, and, society, figure, often, acted, as, chopin, s, adviser, and, in, zamoyski, s, words, gradually, began, to, fill, the, role, of, elder, brother, in, life, on, 7, december, 1831, chopin, received, the, first, major, endorsement, from, an, outstanding, contemporary, when, robert, schumann, reviewing, the, op, 2, variations, in, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, his, first, published, article, on, music, declared, hats, off, gentlemen, a, genius, on, 25, february, 1832, chopin, gave, a, debut, paris, concert, in, the, salons, de, mm, pleyel, at, 9, rue, cadet, which, drew, universal, admiration, the, critic, fran, ois, joseph, f, tis, wrote, in, the, revue, et, gazette, musicale, here, is, a, young, man, who, taking, no, model, has, found, if, not, a, complete, renewal, of, piano, music, an, abundance, of, original, ideas, of, a, kind, to, be, found, nowhere, else, after, this, concert, chopin, realised, that, his, essentially, intimate, keyboard, technique, was, not, optimal, for, large, concert, spaces, later, that, year, he, was, introduced, to, the, wealthy, rothschild, banking, family, whose, patronage, also, opened, doors, for, him, to, other, private, salons, social, gatherings, of, the, aristocracy, and, artistic, and, literary, elite, by, the, end, of, 1832, chopin, had, established, himself, among, the, parisian, musical, elite, and, had, earned, the, respect, of, his, peers, such, as, hiller, liszt, and, berlioz, he, no, longer, depended, financially, upon, his, father, and, in, the, winter, of, 1832, he, began, earning, a, handsome, income, from, publishing, his, works, and, teaching, piano, to, affluent, students, from, all, over, europe, this, freed, him, from, the, strains, of, public, concert, giving, which, he, disliked, chopin, seldom, performed, publicly, in, paris, in, later, years, he, generally, gave, a, single, annual, concert, at, the, salle, pleyel, a, venue, that, seated, three, hundred, he, played, more, frequently, at, salons, but, preferred, playing, at, his, own, paris, apartment, for, small, groups, of, friends, the, musicologist, arthur, hedley, has, observed, that, as, a, pianist, chopin, was, unique, in, acquiring, a, reputation, of, the, highest, order, on, the, basis, of, a, minimum, of, public, appearances, few, more, than, thirty, in, the, course, of, his, lifetime, the, list, of, musicians, who, took, part, in, some, of, his, concerts, indicates, the, richness, of, parisian, artistic, life, during, this, period, examples, include, a, concert, on, 23, march, 1833, in, which, chopin, liszt, and, hiller, performed, on, pianos, a, concerto, by, j, s, bach, for, three, keyboards, and, on, 3, march, 1838, a, concert, in, which, chopin, his, pupil, adolphe, gutmann, charles, valentin, alkan, and, alkan, s, teacher, joseph, zimmermann, performed, alkan, s, arrangement, for, eight, hands, of, two, movements, from, beethoven, s, 7th, symphony, chopin, was, also, involved, in, the, composition, of, liszt, s, hexameron, he, wrote, the, sixth, and, final, variation, on, bellini, s, theme, chopin, s, music, soon, found, success, with, publishers, and, in, 1833, he, contracted, with, maurice, schlesinger, who, arranged, for, it, to, be, published, not, only, in, france, but, through, his, family, connections, also, in, germany, and, england, in, the, spring, of, 1834, chopin, attended, the, lower, rhenish, music, festival, in, aix, la, chapelle, with, hiller, and, it, was, there, that, chopin, met, felix, mendelssohn, after, the, festival, the, three, visited, d, sseldorf, where, mendelssohn, had, been, appointed, musical, director, they, spent, what, mendelssohn, described, as, a, very, agreeable, day, playing, and, discussing, music, at, his, piano, and, met, friedrich, wilhelm, schadow, director, of, the, academy, of, art, and, some, of, his, eminent, pupils, such, as, lessing, bendemann, hildebrandt, and, sohn, in, 1835, chopin, went, to, carlsbad, where, he, spent, time, with, his, parents, it, was, the, last, time, he, would, see, them, on, his, way, back, to, paris, he, met, old, friends, from, warsaw, the, wodzi, skis, their, sons, and, their, daughters, amongst, which, maria, whom, he, occasionally, had, given, piano, lessons, in, poland, this, meeting, prompted, him, to, stay, for, two, weeks, in, dresden, when, he, had, previously, intended, to, return, to, paris, via, leipzig, the, sixteen, year, old, girl, s, portrait, of, the, composer, has, been, considered, along, with, delacroix, s, as, among, the, best, likenesses, of, chopin, in, october, he, finally, reached, leipzig, where, he, met, schumann, clara, wieck, and, mendelssohn, who, organised, for, him, a, performance, of, his, own, oratorio, st, paul, and, who, considered, him, a, perfect, musician, in, july, 1836, chopin, travelled, to, marienbad, and, dresden, to, be, with, the, wodzi, ski, family, and, in, september, he, proposed, to, maria, whose, mother, countess, wodzi, ska, approved, in, principle, chopin, went, on, to, leipzig, where, he, presented, schumann, with, his, g, minor, ballade, at, the, end, of, 1836, he, sent, maria, an, album, in, which, his, sister, ludwika, had, inscribed, seven, of, his, songs, and, his, 1835, nocturne, in, c, sharp, minor, op, 27, no, 1, the, anodyne, thanks, he, received, from, maria, proved, to, be, the, last, letter, he, was, to, have, from, her, chopin, placed, the, letters, he, had, received, from, maria, and, her, mother, into, a, large, envelope, wrote, on, it, the, words, my, sorrow, moja, bieda, and, to, the, end, of, his, life, retained, in, a, desk, drawer, this, keepsake, of, the, second, love, of, his, life, although, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, chopin, first, met, franz, liszt, after, arriving, in, paris, on, 12, december, 1831, he, mentioned, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, woyciechowski, that, i, have, met, rossini, cherubini, baillot, etc, also, kalkbrenner, you, would, not, believe, how, curious, i, was, about, herz, liszt, hiller, etc, liszt, was, in, attendance, at, chopin, s, parisian, debut, on, 26, february, 1832, at, the, salle, pleyel, which, led, him, to, remark, the, most, vigorous, applause, seemed, not, to, suffice, to, our, enthusiasm, in, the, presence, of, this, talented, musician, who, revealed, a, new, phase, of, poetic, sentiment, combined, with, such, happy, innovation, in, the, form, of, his, art, the, two, became, friends, and, for, many, years, lived, close, to, each, other, in, paris, chopin, at, 38, rue, de, la, chauss, e, d, antin, and, liszt, at, the, h, tel, de, france, on, the, rue, laffitte, a, few, blocks, away, they, performed, together, on, seven, occasions, between, 1833, and, 1841, the, first, on, 2, april, 1833, was, at, a, benefit, concert, organised, by, hector, berlioz, for, his, bankrupt, shakespearean, actress, wife, harriet, smithson, during, which, they, played, george, onslow, s, sonata, in, f, minor, for, piano, duet, later, joint, appearances, included, a, benefit, concert, for, the, benevolent, association, of, polish, ladies, in, paris, their, last, appearance, together, in, public, was, for, a, charity, concert, conducted, for, the, beethoven, monument, in, bonn, held, at, the, salle, pleyel, and, the, paris, conservatory, on, 25, and, 26, april, 1841, although, the, two, displayed, great, respect, and, admiration, for, each, other, their, friendship, was, uneasy, and, had, some, qualities, of, a, love, hate, relationship, harold, c, schonberg, believes, that, chopin, displayed, a, tinge, of, jealousy, and, spite, towards, liszt, s, virtuosity, on, the, piano, and, others, have, also, argued, that, he, had, become, enchanted, with, liszt, s, theatricality, showmanship, and, success, liszt, was, the, dedicatee, of, chopin, s, op, 10, tudes, and, his, performance, of, them, prompted, the, composer, to, write, to, hiller, i, should, like, to, rob, him, of, the, way, he, plays, my, studies, however, chopin, expressed, annoyance, in, 1843, when, liszt, performed, one, of, his, nocturnes, with, the, addition, of, numerous, intricate, embellishments, at, which, chopin, remarked, that, he, should, play, the, music, as, written, or, not, play, it, at, all, forcing, an, apology, most, biographers, of, chopin, state, that, after, this, the, two, had, little, to, do, with, each, other, although, in, his, letters, dated, as, late, as, 1848, he, still, referred, to, him, as, my, friend, liszt, some, commentators, point, to, events, in, the, two, men, s, romantic, lives, which, led, to, a, rift, between, them, there, are, claims, that, liszt, had, displayed, jealousy, of, his, mistress, marie, d, agoult, s, obsession, with, chopin, while, others, believe, that, chopin, had, become, concerned, about, liszt, s, growing, relationship, with, george, sand, in, 1836, at, a, party, hosted, by, marie, d, agoult, chopin, met, the, french, author, george, sand, born, aurore, dupin, short, under, five, feet, or, 152, cm, dark, big, eyed, and, a, cigar, smoker, she, initially, repelled, chopin, who, remarked, what, an, unattractive, person, la, sand, is, is, she, really, a, woman, however, by, early, 1837, maria, wodzi, ska, s, mother, had, made, it, clear, to, chopin, in, correspondence, that, a, marriage, with, her, daughter, was, unlikely, to, proceed, it, is, thought, that, she, was, influenced, by, his, poor, health, and, possibly, also, by, rumours, about, his, associations, with, women, such, as, d, agoult, and, sand, chopin, finally, placed, the, letters, from, maria, and, her, mother, in, a, package, on, which, he, wrote, in, polish, my, sorrow, sand, in, a, letter, to, grzyma, a, of, june, 1838, admitted, strong, feelings, for, the, composer, and, debated, whether, to, abandon, a, current, affair, to, begin, a, relationship, with, chopin, she, asked, grzyma, a, to, assess, chopin, s, relationship, with, maria, wodzi, ska, without, realising, that, the, affair, at, least, from, maria, s, side, was, over, in, june, 1837, chopin, visited, london, incognito, in, the, company, of, the, piano, manufacturer, camille, pleyel, where, he, played, at, a, musical, soir, e, at, the, house, of, english, piano, maker, james, broadwood, on, his, return, to, paris, his, association, with, sand, began, in, earnest, and, by, the, end, of, june, 1838, they, had, become, lovers, sand, who, was, six, years, older, than, the, composer, and, had, had, a, series, of, lovers, wrote, at, this, time, i, must, say, i, was, confused, and, amazed, at, the, effect, this, little, creature, had, on, me, i, have, still, not, recovered, from, my, astonishment, and, if, i, were, a, proud, person, i, should, be, feeling, humiliated, at, having, been, carried, away, the, two, spent, a, miserable, winter, on, majorca, 8, november, 1838, to, 13, february, 1839, where, together, with, sand, s, two, children, they, had, journeyed, in, the, hope, of, improving, chopin, s, health, and, that, of, sand, s, 15, year, old, son, maurice, and, also, to, escape, the, threats, of, sand, s, former, lover, f, licien, mallefille, after, discovering, that, the, couple, were, not, married, the, deeply, traditional, catholic, people, of, majorca, became, inhospitable, making, accommodation, difficult, to, find, this, compelled, the, group, to, take, lodgings, in, a, former, carthusian, monastery, in, valldemossa, which, gave, little, shelter, from, the, cold, winter, weather, on, 3, december, 1838, chopin, complained, about, his, bad, health, and, the, incompetence, of, the, doctors, in, majorca, commenting, three, doctors, have, visited, me, the, first, said, i, was, dead, the, second, said, i, was, dying, and, the, third, said, i, was, about, to, die, he, also, had, problems, having, his, pleyel, piano, sent, to, him, having, to, rely, in, the, meantime, on, a, piano, made, in, palma, by, juan, bauza, the, pleyel, piano, finally, arrived, from, paris, in, december, just, shortly, before, chopin, and, sand, left, the, island, chopin, wrote, to, pleyel, in, january, 1839, i, am, sending, you, my, preludes, i, finished, them, on, your, little, piano, which, arrived, in, the, best, possible, condition, in, spite, of, the, sea, the, bad, weather, and, the, palma, customs, chopin, was, also, able, to, undertake, work, while, in, majorca, on, his, ballade, no, 2, op, 38, on, two, polonaises, op, 40, and, on, the, scherzo, no, 3, op, 39, although, this, period, had, been, productive, the, bad, weather, had, such, a, detrimental, effect, on, chopin, s, health, that, sand, determined, to, leave, the, island, to, avoid, further, customs, duties, sand, sold, the, piano, to, a, local, french, couple, the, canuts, the, group, travelled, first, to, barcelona, then, to, marseilles, where, they, stayed, for, a, few, months, while, chopin, convalesced, while, in, marseilles, chopin, made, a, rare, appearance, at, the, organ, during, a, requiem, mass, for, the, tenor, adolphe, nourrit, on, 24, april, 1839, playing, a, transcription, of, franz, schubert, s, lied, die, sterne, d, 939, george, sand, gives, a, description, of, chopin, s, playing, in, a, letter, of, 28, april, 1839, chopin, sacrificed, himself, by, playing, the, organ, at, the, elevation, and, what, an, organ, anyhow, our, boy, made, the, best, of, it, by, using, the, less, discordant, stops, and, he, played, schubert, s, die, sterne, not, with, a, passionate, and, glowing, tone, that, nourrit, used, but, with, a, plaintive, sound, as, soft, as, an, echo, from, another, world, two, or, three, at, most, among, those, present, felt, its, meaning, and, had, tears, in, their, eyes, in, may, 1839, they, headed, to, sand, s, estate, at, nohant, for, the, summer, where, they, spent, most, of, the, following, summers, until, 1846, in, autumn, they, returned, to, paris, where, chopin, s, apartment, at, 5, rue, tronchet, was, close, to, sand, s, rented, accommodation, on, the, rue, pigalle, he, frequently, visited, sand, in, the, evenings, but, both, retained, some, independence, in, 1842, he, and, sand, moved, to, the, square, d, orl, ans, living, in, adjacent, buildings, on, 26, july, 1840, chopin, and, sand, were, present, at, the, dress, rehearsal, of, berlioz, s, grande, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, composed, to, commemorate, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, july, revolution, chopin, was, reportedly, unimpressed, with, the, composition, during, the, summers, at, nohant, particularly, in, the, years, 1839, 1843, except, 1840, chopin, found, quiet, productive, days, during, which, he, composed, many, works, including, his, polonaise, in, a, flat, major, op, 53, sand, compellingly, describes, chopin, s, creative, process, an, inspiration, its, painstaking, elaboration, sometimes, amid, tormented, weeping, and, complaining, with, hundreds, of, changes, in, concept, only, to, return, finally, to, the, initial, idea, among, the, visitors, to, nohant, were, delacroix, and, the, mezzo, soprano, pauline, viardot, whom, chopin, had, advised, on, piano, technique, and, composition, delacroix, gives, an, account, of, staying, at, nohant, in, a, letter, of, 7, june, 1842, the, hosts, could, not, be, more, pleasant, in, entertaining, me, when, we, are, not, all, together, at, dinner, lunch, playing, billiards, or, walking, each, of, us, stays, in, his, room, reading, or, lounging, around, on, a, couch, sometimes, through, the, window, which, opens, on, the, garden, a, gust, of, music, wafts, up, from, chopin, at, work, all, this, mingles, with, the, songs, of, nightingales, and, the, fragrance, of, roses, from, 1842, onwards, chopin, showed, signs, of, serious, illness, after, a, solo, recital, in, paris, on, 21, february, 1842, he, wrote, to, grzyma, a, i, have, to, lie, in, bed, all, day, long, my, mouth, and, tonsils, are, aching, so, much, he, was, forced, by, illness, to, decline, a, written, invitation, from, alkan, to, participate, in, a, repeat, performance, of, the, beethoven, 7th, symphony, arrangement, at, rard, s, on, 1, march, 1843, late, in, 1844, charles, hall, visited, chopin, and, found, him, hardly, able, to, move, bent, like, a, half, opened, penknife, and, evidently, in, great, pain, although, his, spirits, returned, when, he, started, to, play, the, piano, for, his, visitor, chopin, s, health, continued, to, deteriorate, particularly, from, this, time, onwards, modern, research, suggests, that, apart, from, any, other, illnesses, he, may, also, have, suffered, from, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, chopin, s, output, as, a, composer, throughout, this, period, declined, in, quantity, year, by, year, whereas, in, 1841, he, had, written, a, dozen, works, only, six, were, written, in, 1842, and, six, shorter, pieces, in, 1843, in, 1844, he, wrote, only, the, op, 58, sonata, 1845, saw, the, completion, of, three, mazurkas, op, 59, although, these, works, were, more, refined, than, many, of, his, earlier, compositions, zamoyski, concludes, that, his, powers, of, concentration, were, failing, and, his, inspiration, was, beset, by, anguish, both, emotional, and, intellectual, chopin, s, relations, with, sand, were, soured, in, 1846, by, problems, involving, her, daughter, solange, and, solange, s, fianc, the, young, fortune, hunting, sculptor, auguste, cl, singer, the, composer, frequently, took, solange, s, side, in, quarrels, with, her, mother, he, also, faced, jealousy, from, sand, s, son, maurice, moreover, chopin, was, indifferent, to, sand, s, radical, political, pursuits, including, her, enthusiasm, for, the, february, revolution, of, 1848, as, the, composer, s, illness, progressed, sand, had, become, less, of, a, lover, and, more, of, a, nurse, to, chopin, whom, she, called, her, third, child, in, letters, to, third, parties, she, vented, her, impatience, referring, to, him, as, a, child, a, poor, angel, a, sufferer, and, a, beloved, little, corpse, in, 1847, sand, published, her, novel, lucrezia, floriani, whose, main, characters, a, rich, actress, and, a, prince, in, weak, health, could, be, interpreted, as, sand, and, chopin, in, chopin, s, presence, sand, read, the, manuscript, aloud, to, delacroix, who, was, both, shocked, and, mystified, by, its, implications, writing, that, madame, sand, was, perfectly, at, ease, and, chopin, could, hardly, stop, making, admiring, comments, that, year, their, relationship, ended, following, an, angry, correspondence, which, in, sand, s, words, made, a, strange, conclusion, to, nine, years, of, exclusive, friendship, grzyma, a, who, had, followed, their, romance, from, the, beginning, commented, if, had, not, had, the, misfortune, of, meeting, g, s, who, poisoned, his, whole, being, he, would, have, lived, to, be, cherubini, s, age, chopin, would, die, two, years, later, at, thirty, nine, the, composer, luigi, cherubini, had, died, in, paris, in, 1842, at, the, age, of, 81, chopin, s, public, popularity, as, a, virtuoso, began, to, wane, as, did, the, number, of, his, pupils, and, this, together, with, the, political, strife, and, instability, of, the, time, caused, him, to, struggle, financially, in, february, 1848, with, the, cellist, auguste, franchomme, he, gave, his, last, paris, concert, which, included, three, movements, of, the, cello, sonata, op, 65, in, april, during, the, 1848, revolution, in, paris, he, left, for, london, where, he, performed, at, several, concerts, and, numerous, receptions, in, great, houses, this, tour, was, suggested, to, him, by, his, scottish, pupil, jane, stirling, and, her, elder, sister, stirling, also, made, all, the, logistical, arrangements, and, provided, much, of, the, necessary, funding, in, london, chopin, took, lodgings, at, dover, street, where, the, firm, of, broadwood, provided, him, with, a, grand, piano, at, his, first, engagement, on, 15, may, at, stafford, house, the, audience, included, queen, victoria, and, prince, albert, the, prince, who, was, himself, a, talented, musician, moved, close, to, the, keyboard, to, view, chopin, s, technique, broadwood, also, arranged, concerts, for, him, among, those, attending, were, the, author, william, makepeace, thackeray, and, the, singer, jenny, lind, chopin, was, also, sought, after, for, piano, lessons, for, which, he, charged, the, high, fee, of, one, guinea, per, hour, and, for, private, recitals, for, which, the, fee, was, 20, guineas, at, a, concert, on, 7, july, he, shared, the, platform, with, viardot, who, sang, arrangements, of, some, of, his, mazurkas, to, spanish, texts, a, few, days, later, he, performed, for, thomas, carlyle, and, his, wife, jane, at, their, home, in, chelsea, on, 28, august, he, played, at, a, concert, in, manchester, s, gentlemen, s, concert, hall, sharing, the, stage, with, marietta, alboni, and, lorenzo, salvi, in, late, summer, he, was, invited, by, jane, stirling, to, visit, scotland, where, he, stayed, at, calder, house, near, edinburgh, and, at, johnstone, castle, in, renfrewshire, both, owned, by, members, of, stirling, s, family, she, clearly, had, a, notion, of, going, beyond, mere, friendship, and, chopin, was, obliged, to, make, it, clear, to, her, that, this, could, not, be, so, he, wrote, at, this, time, to, grzyma, a, my, scottish, ladies, are, kind, but, such, bores, and, responding, to, a, rumour, about, his, involvement, answered, that, he, was, closer, to, the, grave, than, the, nuptial, bed, he, gave, a, public, concert, in, glasgow, on, 27, september, and, another, in, edinburgh, at, the, hopetoun, rooms, on,

public, appearance, on, a, concert, platform, at, london, s, guildhall, on, 16, november, 1848, when, in, a, final, patriotic, gesture, he, played, for, the, benefit, of, polish, refugees, this, gesture, proved, to, be, a, mistake, as, most, of, the, participants, were, more, interested, in, the, dancing, and, refreshments, than, in, chopin, s, piano, artistry, which, drained, him, by, this, time, he, was, very, seriously, ill, weighing, under, 45, kg, 99, lb, and, his, doctors, were, aware, that, his, sickness, was, at, a, terminal, stage, at, the, end, of, november, chopin, returned,

and, the, cause, of, his, death, have, been, topics, of, debate, his, death, certificate, gave, the, cause, as, tuberculosis, and, his, physician, cruveilhier, was, then, the, leading, french, authority, on, this, disease, other, possibilities, advanced, have, included, cystic, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, a, visual, examination, of, chopin, s, preserved, heart, the, jar, was, not, opened, conducted, in, 2014, and, first, published, in, the, american, journal, of, medicine, in, 2017, suggested, that, the, likely, cause, of, his, death, was, a, rare, case, of, pericarditis, caused, by, complications, of, chronic, tuberculosis, over, 230, works, of, chopin, survive, some, compositions, from, early, childhood, have, been, lost, all, his, known,

haydn, mozart, and, clementi, he, used, clementi, s, piano, method, with, his, students, he, was, also, influenced, by, hummel, s, development, of, virtuoso, yet, mozartian, piano, technique, he, cited, bach, and, mozart, as, the, two, most, important, composers, in, shaping, his, musical, outlook, chopin, s, early, works, are, in, the, style, of, the, brilliant, keyboard, pieces, of, his, era, as, exemplified, by, the, works, of, ignaz, moscheles, friedrich, kalkbrenner, and, others, less, direct, in, the, earlier, period, are, the, influences, of, polish, folk, music, and, of, italian, opera, much, of, what, became, his, typical, style, of, ornamentation, for, example, his, fioriture, is, taken, from, singing, his, melodic, lines, were, increasingly, reminiscent, of, the, modes, and, features, of, the, music, of, his, native, country, such, as, drones, chopin, took, the, new, salon, genre, of, the, nocturne, invented, by, the, irish, composer, john, field, to, a, deeper, level, of, sophistication, he, was, the, first, to, write, ballades, and, scherzi, as, individual, concert, pieces, he, essentially, established, a, new, genre, with, his, own, set, of, free, standing, preludes, op, 28, published, 1839, he, exploited, the, poetic, potential, of, the, concept, of, the, concert, tude, already, being, developed, in, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, by, liszt, clementi, and, moscheles, in, his, two, sets, of, studies, op, 10, published, in, 1833, op, 25, in, 1837, chopin, also, endowed, popular, dance, forms, with, a, greater, range, of, melody, and, expression, chopin, s, mazurkas, while, originating, in, the, traditional, polish, dance, the, mazurek, differed, from, the, traditional, variety, in, that, they, were, written, for, the, concert, hall, rather, than, the, dance, hall, as, j, barrie, jones, puts, it, it, was, chopin, who, put, the, mazurka, on, the, european, musical, map, the, series, of, seven, polonaises, published, in, his, lifetime, another, nine, were, published, posthumously, beginning, with, the, op, 26, pair, published, 1836, set, a, new, standard, for, music, in, the, form, his, waltzes, were, also, written, specifically, for, the, salon, recital, rather, than, the, ballroom, and, are, frequently, at, rather, faster, tempos, than, their, dance, floor, equivalents, some, of, chopin, s, well, known, pieces, have, acquired, descriptive, titles, such, as, the, revolutionary, tude, op, 10, no, 12, and, the, minute, waltz, op, 64, no, 1, however, except, for, his, funeral, march, the, composer, never, named, an, instrumental, work, beyond, genre, and, number, leaving, all, potential, extramusical, associations, to, the, listener, the, names, by, which, many, of, his, pieces, are, known, were, invented, by, others, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, revolutionary, tude, was, written, with, the, failed, polish, uprising, against, russia, in, mind, it, merely, appeared, at, that, time, the, funeral, march, the, third, movement, of, his, sonata, no, 2, op, 35, the, one, case, where, he, did, give, a, title, was, written, before, the, rest, of, the, sonata, but, no, specific, event, or, death, is, known, to, have, inspired, it, the, last, opus, number, that, chopin, himself, used, was, 65, allocated, to, the, cello, sonata, in, g, minor, he, expressed, a, deathbed, wish, that, all, his, unpublished, manuscripts, be, destroyed, at, the, request, of, the, composer, s, mother, and, sisters, however, his, musical, executor, julian, fontana, selected, 23, unpublished, piano, pieces, and, grouped, them, into, eight, further, opus, numbers, opp, 66, 73, published, in, 1855, in, 1857, 17, polish, songs, that, chopin, wrote, at, various, stages, of, his, life, were, collected, and, published, as, op, 74, though, their, order, within, the, opus, did, not, reflect, the, order, of, composition, works, published, since, 1857, have, received, alternative, catalogue, designations, instead, of, opus, numbers, the, most, up, to, date, catalogue, is, maintained, by, the, fryderyk, chopin, institute, at, its, internet, chopin, information, centre, the, older, kobyla, ska, catalogue, usually, represented, by, the, initials, kk, named, for, its, compiler, the, polish, musicologist, krystyna, kobyla, ska, is, still, considered, an, important, scholarly, reference, the, most, recent, catalogue, of, posthumously, published, works, is, that, of, the, national, edition, of, the, works, of, fryderyk, chopin, represented, by, the, initials, wn, chopin, s, original, publishers, included, maurice, schlesinger, and, camille, pleyel, his, works, soon, began, to, appear, in, popular, 19th, century, piano, anthologies, the, first, collected, edition, was, by, breitkopf, h, rtel, 1878, 1902, among, modern, scholarly, editions, of, chopin, s, works, is, the, version, named, after, paderewski, although, he, died, before, the, work, had, begun, published, between, 1949, and, 1961, however, scholarly, opinion, has, moved, against, this, edition, the, more, recent, polish, national, edition, edited, by, jan, ekier, and, published, between, 1967, and, 2010, is, recommended, to, contestants, of, the, chopin, competition, both, editions, contain, detailed, explanations, and, discussions, regarding, choices, and, sources, chopin, published, his, music, in, france, england, and, the, german, states, i, e, he, worked, with, as, many, as, three, separate, publishers, for, each, piece, or, set, of, pieces, due, to, the, copyright, laws, of, the, time, thus, there, are, often, three, different, first, editions, of, each, work, each, edition, is, different, from, the, others, chopin, edited, them, separately, and, at, times, he, did, some, revision, to, the, music, while, editing, it, furthermore, chopin, provided, his, publishers, with, varying, sources, including, autographs, annotated, proofsheets, and, scribal, copies, only, recently, have, these, differences, gained, greater, recognition, improvisation, stands, at, the, centre, of, chopin, s, creative, processes, however, this, does, not, imply, impulsive, rambling, nicholas, temperley, writes, that, improvisation, is, designed, for, an, audience, and, its, starting, point, is, that, audience, s, expectations, which, include, the, current, conventions, of, musical, form, the, works, for, piano, and, orchestra, including, the, two, concertos, are, held, by, temperley, to, be, merely, vehicles, for, brilliant, piano, playing, formally, longwinded, and, extremely, conservative, after, the, piano, concertos, which, are, both, early, dating, from, 1830, chopin, made, no, attempts, at, large, scale, multi, movement, forms, save, for, his, late, sonatas, for, piano, and, cello, instead, he, achieved, near, perfection, in, pieces, of, simple, general, design, but, subtle, and, complex, cell, structure, rosen, suggests, that, an, important, aspect, of, chopin, s, individuality, is, his, flexible, handling, of, the, four, bar, phrase, as, a, structural, unit, j, barrie, jones, suggests, that, amongst, the, works, that, chopin, intended, for, concert, use, the, four, ballades, and, four, scherzi, stand, supreme, and, adds, that, the, barcarolle, op, 60, stands, apart, as, an, example, of, chopin, s, rich, harmonic, palette, coupled, with, an, italianate, warmth, of, melody, temperley, opines, that, these, works, which, contain, immense, variety, of, mood, thematic, material, and, structural, detail, are, based, on, an, extended, departure, and, return, form, the, more, the, middle, section, is, extended, and, the, further, it, departs, in, key, mood, and, theme, from, the, opening, idea, the, more, important, and, dramatic, is, the, reprise, when, it, at, last, comes, chopin, s, mazurkas, and, waltzes, are, all, in, straightforward, ternary, or, episodic, form, sometimes, with, a, coda, the, mazurkas, often, show, more, folk, features, than, many, of, his, other, works, sometimes, including, modal, scales, and, harmonies, and, the, use, of, drone, basses, however, some, also, show, unusual, sophistication, for, example, op, 63, no, 3, which, includes, a, canon, at, one, beat, s, distance, a, great, rarity, in, music, chopin, s, polonaises, show, a, marked, advance, on, those, of, his, polish, predecessors, in, the, form, who, included, his, teachers, ywny, and, elsner, as, with, the, traditional, polonaise, chopin, s, works, are, in, triple, time, and, typically, display, a, martial, rhythm, in, their, melodies, accompaniments, and, cadences, unlike, most, of, their, precursors, they, also, require, a, formidable, playing, technique, his, nocturnes, are, more, structured, and, of, greater, emotional, depth, than, those, of, field, whom, chopin, met, in, 1833, many, of, the, chopin, nocturnes, have, middle, sections, marked, by, agitated, expression, and, often, making, very, difficult, demands, on, the, performer, which, heightens, their, dramatic, character, chopin, s, tudes, are, largely, in, straightforward, ternary, form, he, used, them, to, teach, his, own, technique, of, piano, playing, for, instance, playing, double, thirds, op, 25, no, 6, playing, in, octaves, op, 25, no, 10, and, playing, repeated, notes, op, 10, no, 7, the, preludes, many, of, which, are, very, brief, were, described, by, schumann, as, the, beginnings, of, studies, inspired, by, j, s, bach, s, the, well, tempered, clavier, chopin, s, preludes, move, up, the, circle, of, fifths, rather, than, bach, s, chromatic, scale, sequence, to, create, a, prelude, in, each, major, and, minor, tonality, the, preludes, were, perhaps, not, intended, to, be, played, as, a, group, and, may, even, have, been, used, by, him, and, later, pianists, as, generic, preludes, to, others, of, his, pieces, or, even, to, music, by, other, composers, this, is, suggested, by, kenneth, hamilton, who, has, noted, a, 1922, recording, by, ferruccio, busoni, in, which, the, prelude, op, 28, no, 7, is, followed, by, the, tude, op, 10, no, 5, the, two, mature, chopin, piano, sonatas, no, 2, op, 35, written, in, 1839, and, no, 3, op, 58, written, in, 1844, are, in, four, movements, in, op, 35, chopin, combined, within, a, formal, large, musical, structure, many, elements, of, his, virtuosic, piano, technique, a, kind, of, dialogue, between, the, public, pianism, of, the, brilliant, style, and, the, german, sonata, principle, this, sonata, has, been, considered, as, showing, the, influences, of, both, bach, and, beethoven, the, prelude, from, bach, s, suite, no, 6, in, d, major, for, cello, bwv, 1012, is, quoted, and, there, are, references, to, two, sonatas, of, beethoven, the, sonata, opus, 111, and, the, sonata, opus, 26, which, like, chopin, s, op, 35, has, a, funeral, march, as, its, slow, movement, the, last, movement, of, chopin, s, op, 35, a, brief, 75, bar, perpetuum, mobile, in, which, the, hands, play, in, unmodified, octave, unison, throughout, was, found, shocking, and, unmusical, by, contemporaries, including, schumann, the, op, 58, sonata, is, closer, to, the, german, tradition, including, many, passages, of, complex, counterpoint, worthy, of, brahms, according, to, samson, chopin, s, harmonic, innovations, may, have, arisen, partly, from, his, keyboard, improvisation, technique, in, his, works, temperley, says, novel, harmonic, effects, often, result, from, the, combination, of, ordinary, appoggiaturas, or, passing, notes, with, melodic, figures, of, accompaniment, and, cadences, are, delayed, by, the, use, of, chords, outside, the, home, key, neapolitan, sixths, and, diminished, sevenths, or, by, sudden, shifts, to, remote, keys, chord, progressions, sometimes, anticipate, the, shifting, tonality, of, later, composers, such, as, claude, debussy, as, does, chopin, s, use, of, modal, harmony, in, 1841, l, on, escudier, wrote, of, a, recital, given, by, chopin, that, year, one, may, say, that, chopin, is, the, creator, of, a, school, of, piano, and, a, school, of, composition, in, truth, nothing, equals, the, lightness, the, sweetness, with, which, the, composer, preludes, on, the, piano, moreover, nothing, may, be, compared, to, his, works, full, of, originality, distinction, and, grace, chopin, refused, to, conform, to, a, standard, method, of, playing, and, believed, that, there, was, no, set, technique, for, playing, well, his, style, was, based, extensively, on, his, use, of, a, very, independent, finger, technique, in, his, projet, de, m, thode, he, wrote, everything, is, a, matter, of, knowing, good, fingering, we, need, no, less, to, use, the, rest, of, the, hand, the, wrist, the, forearm, and, the, upper, arm, he, further, stated, one, needs, only, to, study, a, certain, position, of, the, hand, in, relation, to, the, keys, to, obtain, with, ease, the, most, beautiful, quality, of, sound, to, know, how, to, play, short, notes, and, long, notes, and, unlimited, dexterity, the, consequences, of, this, approach, to, technique, in, chopin, s, music, include, the, frequent, use, of, the, entire, range, of, the, keyboard, passages, in, double, octaves, and, other, chord, groupings, swiftly, repeated, notes, the, use, of, grace, notes, and, the, use, of, contrasting, rhythms, four, against, three, for, example, between, the, hands, jonathan, bellman, writes, that, modern, concert, performance, style, set, in, the, conservatory, tradition, of, late, 19th, and, 20th, century, music, schools, and, suitable, for, large, auditoria, or, recordings, militates, against, what, is, known, of, chopin, s, more, intimate, performance, technique, the, composer, himself, said, to, a, pupil, that, concerts, are, never, real, music, you, have, to, give, up, the, idea, of, hearing, in, them, all, the, most, beautiful, things, of, art, contemporary, accounts, indicate, that, in, performance, chopin, avoided, rigid, procedures, sometimes, incorrectly, attributed, to, him, such, as, always, crescendo, to, a, high, note, but, that, he, was, concerned, with, expressive, phrasing, rhythmic, consistency, and, sensitive, colouring, berlioz, wrote, in, 1853, that, chopin, has, created, a, kind, of, chromatic, embroidery, whose, effect, is, so, strange, and, piquant, as, to, be, impossible, to, describe, virtually, nobody, but, chopin, himself, can, play, this, music, and, give, it, this, unusual, turn, hiller, wrote, that, what, in, the, hands, of, others, was, elegant, embellishment, in, his, hands, became, a, colourful, wreath, of, flowers, chopin, s, music, is, frequently, played, with, rubato, the, practice, in, performance, of, disregarding, strict, time, robbing, some, note, values, for, expressive, effect, there, are, differing, opinions, as, to, how, much, and, what, type, of, rubato, is, appropriate, for, his, works, charles, rosen, comments, that, most, of, the, written, out, indications, of, rubato, in, chopin, are, to, be, found, in, his, mazurkas, it, is, probable, that, chopin, used, the, older, form, of, rubato, so, important, to, mozart, the, melody, note, in, the, right, hand, is, delayed, until, after, the, note, in, the, bass, an, allied, form, of, this, rubato, is, the, arpeggiation, of, the, chords, thereby, delaying, the, melody, note, according, to, chopin, s, pupil, karol, mikuli, chopin, was, firmly, opposed, to, this, practice, chopin, s, pupil, friederike, m, ller, wrote, playing, was, always, noble, and, beautiful, his, tones, sang, whether, in, full, forte, or, softest, piano, he, took, infinite, pains, to, teach, his, pupils, this, legato, cantabile, style, of, playing, his, most, severe, criticism, was, he, or, she, does, not, know, how, to, join, two, notes, together, he, also, demanded, the, strictest, adherence, to, rhythm, he, hated, all, lingering, and, dragging, misplaced, rubatos, as, well, as, exaggerated, ritardandos, and, it, is, precisely, in, this, respect, that, people, make, such, terrible, errors, in, playing, his, works, when, living, in, warsaw, chopin, composed, and, played, on, an, instrument, built, by, the, piano, maker, fryderyk, buchholtz, later, in, paris, chopin, purchased, a, piano, from, pleyel, he, rated, pleyel, s, pianos, as, non, plus, ultra, nothing, better, franz, liszt, befriended, chopin, in, paris, and, described, the, sound, of, chopin, s, pleyel, as, being, the, marriage, of, crystal, and, water, while, in, london, in, 1848, chopin, mentioned, his, pianos, in, his, letters, i, have, a, large, drawing, room, with, three, pianos, a, pleyel, a, broadwood, and, an, erard, the, polish, character, of, chopin, s, work, is, unquestionable, not, because, he, also, wrote, polonaises, and, mazurkas, which, forms, were, often, stuffed, with, alien, ideological, and, literary, contents, from, the, outside, as, an, artist, he, looked, for, forms, that, stood, apart, from, the, literary, dramatic, character, of, music, which, was, a, feature, of, romanticism, as, a, pole, he, reflected, in, his, work, the, very, essence, of, the, tragic, break, in, the, history, of, the, people, and, instinctively, aspired, to, give, the, deepest, expression, of, his, nation, for, he, understood, that, he, could, invest, his, music, with, the, most, enduring, and, truly, polish, qualities, only, by, liberating, art, from, the, confines, of, dramatic, and, historical, contents, this, attitude, toward, the, question, of, national, music, an, inspired, solution, to, his, art, was, the, reason, why, chopin, s, works, have, come, to, be, understood, everywhere, outside, of, poland, therein, lies, the, strange, riddle, of, his, eternal, vigour, karol, szymanowski, 1923, with, his, mazurkas, and, polonaises, chopin, has, been, credited, with, introducing, to, music, a, new, sense, of, nationalism, schumann, in, his, 1836, review, of, the, piano, concertos, highlighted, the, composer, s, strong, feelings, for, his, native, poland, writing, now, that, the, poles, are, in, deep, mourning, their, appeal, to, us, artists, is, even, stronger, if, the, mighty, autocrat, in, the, north, could, know, that, in, chopin, s, works, in, the, simple, strains, of, his, mazurkas, there, lurks, a, dangerous, enemy, he, would, place, a, ban, on, his, music, chopin, s, works, are, cannon, buried, in, flowers, the, biography, of, chopin, published, in, 1863, under, the, name, of, franz, liszt, but, probably, written, by, carolyne, zu, sayn, wittgenstein, states, that, chopin, must, be, ranked, first, among, the, first, musicians, individualizing, in, themselves, the, poetic, sense, of, an, entire, nation, some, modern, commentators, have, argued, against, exaggerating, chopin, s, primacy, as, a, nationalist, or, patriotic, composer, george, golos, refers, to, earlier, nationalist, composers, in, central, europe, including, poland, s, micha, kleofas, ogi, ski, and, franciszek, lessel, who, utilised, polonaise, and, mazurka, forms, barbara, milewski, suggests, that, chopin, s, experience, of, polish, music, came, more, from, urbanised, warsaw, versions, than, from, folk, music, and, that, attempts, by, jachimecki, and, others, to, demonstrate, genuine, folk, music, in, his, works, are, without, basis, richard, taruskin, impugns, schumann, s, attitude, toward, chopin, s, works, as, patronising, and, comments, that, chopin, felt, his, polish, patriotism, deeply, and, sincerely, but, consciously, modelled, his, works, on, the, tradition, of, bach, beethoven, schubert, and, field, a, reconciliation, of, these, views, is, suggested, by, william, atwood, undoubtedly, use, of, traditional, musical, forms, like, the, polonaise, and, mazurka, roused, nationalistic, sentiments, and, a, sense, of, cohesiveness, amongst, those, poles, scattered, across, europe, and, the, new, world, while, some, sought, solace, in, others, found, them, a, source, of, strength, in, their, continuing, struggle, for, freedom, although, chopin, s, music, undoubtedly, came, to, him, intuitively, rather, than, through, any, conscious, patriotic, design, it, served, all, the, same, to, symbolize, the, will, of, the, polish, people, jones, comments, that, chopin, s, unique, position, as, a, composer, despite, the, fact, that, virtually, everything, he, wrote, was, for, the, piano, has, rarely, been, questioned, he, also, notes, that, chopin, was, fortunate, to, arrive, in, paris, in, 1831, the, artistic, environment, the, publishers, who, were, willing, to, print, his, music, the, wealthy, and, aristocratic, who, paid, what, chopin, asked, for, their, lessons, and, these, factors, as, well, as, his, musical, genius, also, fuelled, his, contemporary, and, later, reputation, while, his, illness, and, his, love, affairs, conform, to, some, of, the, stereotypes, of, romanticism, the, rarity, of, his, public, recitals, as, opposed, to, performances, at, fashionable, paris, soir, es, led, arthur, hutchings, to, suggest, that, his, lack, of, byronic, flamboyance, his, aristocratic, reclusiveness, make, him, exceptional, among, his, romantic, contemporaries, such, as, liszt, and, henri, herz, chopin, s, qualities, as, a, pianist, and, composer, were, recognised, by, many, of, his, fellow, musicians, schumann, named, a, piece, for, him, in, his, suite, carnaval, and, chopin, later, dedicated, his, ballade, no, 2, in, f, major, to, schumann, elements, of, chopin, s, music, can, be, found, in, many, of, liszt, s, later, works, liszt, later, transcribed, for, piano, six, of, chopin, s, polish, songs, a, less, fraught, friendship, was, with, alkan, with, whom, he, discussed, elements, of, folk, music, and, who, was, deeply, affected, by, chopin, s, death, in, paris, chopin, had, a, number, of, pupils, including, friedericke, m, ller, who, left, memoirs, of, his, teaching, and, the, prodigy, carl, filtsch, to, whom, both, chopin, and, sand, became, dedicated, chopin, giving, him, three, lessons, a, week, filtsch, was, the, only, pupil, to, whom, chopin, gave, lessons, in, composition, and, exceptionally, he, on, several, occasions, shared, a, concert, platform, with, him, two, of, chopin, s, long, standing, pupils, karol, mikuli, and, georges, mathias, were, themselves, piano, teachers, and, passed, on, details, of, his, playing, to, their, students, some, of, whom, such, as, raoul, koczalski, were, to, make, recordings, of, his, music, other, pianists, and, composers, influenced, by, chopin, s, style, include, louis, moreau, gottschalk, douard, wolff, and, pierre, zimmermann, debussy, dedicated, his, own, 1915, piano, tudes, to, the, memory, of, chopin, he, frequently, played, chopin, s, music, during, his, studies, at, the, paris, conservatoire, and, undertook, the, editing, of, chopin, s, piano, music, for, the, publisher, jacques, durand, polish, composers, of, the, following, generation, included, virtuosi, such, as, moritz, moszkowski, but, in, the, opinion, of, j, barrie, jones, his, one, worthy, successor, among, his, compatriots, was, karol, szymanowski, edvard, grieg, anton, n, dvo, k, isaac, alb, niz, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, and, sergei, rachmaninoff, among, others, are, regarded, by, critics, as, having, been, influenced, by, chopin, s, use, of, national, modes, and, idioms, alexander, scriabin, was, devoted, to, the, music, of, chopin, and, his, early, published, works, include, nineteen, mazurkas, as, well, as, numerous, tudes, and, preludes, his, teacher, nikolai, zverev, drilled, him, in, chopin, s, works, to, improve, his, virtuosity, as, a, performer, in, the, 20th, century, composers, who, paid, homage, to, or, in, some, cases, parodied, the, music, of, chopin, included, george, crumb, leopold, godowsky, bohuslav, martin, darius, milhaud, igor, stravinsky, and, heitor, villa, lobos, chopin, s, music, was, used, in, the, 1909, ballet, chopiniana, choreographed, by, michel, fokine, and, orchestrated, by, alexander, glazunov, sergei, diaghilev, commissioned, additional, orchestrations, from, stravinsky, anatoly, lyadov, sergei, taneyev, and, nikolai, tcherepnin, for, later, productions, which, used, the, title, les, sylphides, other, noted, composers, have, created, orchestrations, for, the, ballet, including, benjamin, britten, roy, douglas, alexander, gretchaninov, gordon, jacob, and, maurice, ravel, whose, score, is, lost, musicologist, erinn, knyt, writes, in, the, nineteenth, century, chopin, and, his, music, were, commonly, viewed, as, effeminate, androgynous, childish, sickly, and, ethnically, other, music, historian, jeffrey, kallberg, says, that, in, chopin, s, time, listeners, to, the, genre, of, the, piano, nocturne, often, couched, their, reactions, in, feminine, imagery, and, he, cites, many, examples, of, such, reactions, to, chopin, s, nocturnes, one, reason, for, this, may, be, demographic, there, were, more, female, than, male, piano, players, and, playing, such, romantic, pieces, was, seen, by, male, critics, as, a, female, domestic, pastime, such, genderization, was, not, commonly, applied, to, other, genres, among, chopin, s, works, such, as, the, scherzo, or, the, polonaise, the, cultural, historian, edward, said, has, cited, the, demonstrations, by, pianist, and, writer, charles, rosen, in, the, latter, s, book, the, romantic, generation, of, chopin, s, skills, in, planning, polyphony, and, sheer, harmonic, creativity, as, effectively, overthrowing, any, legend, of,
