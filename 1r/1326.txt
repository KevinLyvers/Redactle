empire, and, the, kouloughlis, there, was, a, lot, of, pent, up, resentment, against, the, ottomans, when, the, french, arrived, and, due, to, numerous, rebellions, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, algerians, could, not, oppose, the, french, at, all, initially, when, the, french, africa, army, reached, oran, in, january, 1831, abdelkader, s, father, was, asked, to, lead, a, resistance, campaign, against, them, muhieddine, called, for, jihad, and, he, and, his, son, were, among, those, involved, in, early, attacks, below, the, walls, of, the, city, it, was, at, this, point, that, abdelkader, came, to, the, fore, at, a, meeting, of, the, western, tribes, in, the, autumn, of, 1832, he, was, elected, amir, al, mu, minin, typically, abbreviated, to, emir, following, his, father, s, refusal, of, the, position, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, too, old, the, appointment, was, confirmed, five, days, later, at, the, great, mosque, of, mascara, within, a, year, through, a, combination, of, punitive, raids, and, careful, politics, abdelkader, had, succeeded, in, uniting, the, tribes, in, the, region, and, in, reestablishing, security, his, area, of, influence, now, covered, the, entire, province, of, oran, the, local, french, commander, in, chief, general, louis, alexis, desmichels, saw, abdelkader, as, the, principal, representative, of, the, area, during, peace, negotiations, and, in, 1834, they, signed, the, desmichels, treaty, which, ceded, near, total, control, of, oran, province, to, abdelkader, for, the, french, this, was, a, way, of, establishing, peace, in, the, region, while, also, confining, abdelkader, to, the, west, but, his, status, as, a, co, signatory, also, did, much, to, elevate, him, in, the, eyes, of, the, berbers, and, of, the, french, using, this, treaty, as, a, start, he, imposed, his, rule, on, the, tribes, of, the, chelif, miliana, and, m, d, a, the, french, high, command, unhappy, with, what, they, now, saw, as, the, unfavorable, terms, of, the, desmichels, treaty, recalled, general, desmichels, and, replaced, him, with, general, camille, alphonse, tr, zel, which, caused, a, resumption, of, hostilities, abdelkader, s, tribal, warriors, met, the, french, forces, in, july, 1834, at, the, battle, of, macta, where, the, french, suffered, an, unexpected, defeat, france, s, response, was, to, step, up, its, military, campaign, and, under, new, commanders, the, french, won, several, important, encounters, including, the, 1836, battle, of, sikkak, but, political, opinion, in, france, was, becoming, ambivalent, towards, algeria, and, when, general, thomas, robert, bugeaud, was, deployed, to, the, region, in, april, 1837, he, was, authorized, to, use, all, means, to, induce, abd, el, kader, to, make, overtures, of, peace, the, result, after, protracted, negotiations, was, the, treaty, of, tafna, signed, on, 30, may, 1837, this, treaty, gave, even, more, control, of, interior, portions, of, algeria, to, abdelkader, but, with, the, recognition, of, france, s, right, to, imperial, sovereignty, abdelkader, thus, won, control, of, all, of, oran, province, and, extended, his, reach, to, the, neighbouring, province, of, titteri, and, beyond, the, period, of, peace, following, the, treaty, of, tafna, benefited, both, sides, and, the, emir, abdelkader, took, the, opportunity, to, consolidate, a, new, functional, state, with, a, capital, in, tagdemt, he, played, down, his, political, power, however, repeatedly, declining, the, title, of, sultan, and, striving, to, concentrate, on, his, spiritual, authority, the, state, he, created, was, broadly, theocratic, and, most, positions, of, authority, were, held, by, members, of, the, religious, aristocracy, even, the, main, unit, of, currency, was, named, the, muhammadiyya, after, the, prophet, his, first, military, action, was, to, move, south, into, the, sahara, and, al, tijani, next, he, moved, east, to, the, valley, of, the, chelif, and, titteri, but, was, resisted, by, the, bey, of, constantine, province, hajj, ahmed, in, other, actions, he, demanded, punishment, of, the, kouloughlis, of, zouatna, for, supporting, the, french, by, the, end, of, 1838, his, rule, extended, east, to, kabylie, and, south, to, biskra, and, to, the, moroccan, border, he, continued, to, fight, al, tijani, and, besieged, his, capital, at, a, n, madhi, for, six, months, eventually, destroying, it, another, aspect, of, abdelkader, that, helped, him, lead, his, fledgling, nation, was, his, ability, to, find, and, use, good, talent, regardless, of, its, nationality, he, would, employ, jews, and, christians, on, his, way, to, building, his, nation, one, of, these, was, l, on, roches, his, approach, to, the, military, was, to, have, a, standing, army, of, 2000, men, supported, by, volunteers, from, the, local, tribes, he, placed, in, the, interior, towns, arsenals, warehouses, and, workshops, where, he, stored, items, to, be, sold, for, arms, purchases, from, england, through, his, frugal, living, he, lived, in, a, tent, he, taught, his, people, the, need, for, austerity, and, through, education, he, taught, them, concepts, such, as, nationality, and, independence, the, peace, ended, when, the, duc, d, orl, ans, ignoring, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, tafna, headed, an, expeditionary, force, that, breached, the, iron, gates, on, 15, october, 1839, abd, al, qadir, attacked, the, french, as, they, were, colonizing, the, plains, of, mitidja, and, routed, the, invaders, in, response, the, french, officially, declared, war, on, 18, november, 1839, the, fighting, bogged, down, until, general, thomas, robert, bugeaud, returned, to, algeria, this, time, as, governor, general, in, february, 1841, abdelkader, was, originally, encouraged, to, hear, that, bugeaud, the, promoter, of, the, treaty, of, tafna, was, returning, but, this, time, bugeaud, s, tactics, would, be, radically, different, this, time, his, approach, was, one, of, annihilation, with, the, conquest, of, algeria, as, the, endgame, i, will, enter, into, your, mountains, i, will, burn, your, villages, and, your, harvests, i, will, cut, down, your, fruit, trees, abdelkader, was, effective, at, using, guerrilla, warfare, and, for, a, decade, up, until, 1842, scored, many, victories, he, often, signed, tactical, truces, with, the, french, but, these, did, not, last, his, power, base, was, in, the, western, part, of, algeria, where, he, was, successful, in, uniting, the, tribes, against, the, french, he, was, noted, for, his, chivalry, on, one, occasion, he, released, his, french, captives, simply, because, he, had, insufficient, food, to, feed, them, throughout, this, period, abdelkader, demonstrated, political, and, military, leadership, and, acted, as, a, capable, administrator, and, a, persuasive, orator, his, fervent, faith, in, the, doctrines, of, islam, was, unquestioned, until, the, beginning, of, 1842, the, struggle, went, in, his, favor, however, the, resistance, was, put, down, by, marshal, bugeaud, due, to, bugeaud, s, adaptation, to, the, guerilla, tactics, employed, by, abdelkader, abdelkader, would, strike, fast, and, disappear, into, the, terrain, with, light, infantry, however, the, french, increased, their, mobility, the, french, armies, brutally, suppressed, the, native, population, and, practiced, a, scorched, earth, policy, in, the, countryside, to, force, the, residents, to, starve, so, as, to, desert, their, leader, by, 1841, his, fortifications, had, all, but, been, destroyed, and, he, was, forced, to, wander, the, interior, of, the, oran, in, 1842, he, had, lost, control, of, tlemcen, and, his, lines, of, communications, with, morocco, were, not, effective, he, was, able, to, cross, the, border, into, morocco, for, a, respite, but, the, french, defeated, the, moroccans, at, the, battle, of, isly, he, left, morocco, and, was, able, to, keep, up, the, fight, to, the, french, by, taking, the, sidi, brahim, at, the, battle, of, sidi, brahim, abdelkader, was, ultimately, forced, to, surrender, his, failure, to, get, support, from, eastern, tribes, apart, from, the, kabyles, of, western, kabylie, had, contributed, to, the, quelling, of, the, rebellion, and, a, decree, from, abd, al, rahman, of, morocco, following, the, 1844, treaty, of, tangiers, had, outlawed, the, emir, from, his, entire, kingdom, abd, al, rahman, of, morocco, secretly, sent, soldiers, to, attack, abdelkader, and, destroy, his, supplies, six, months, after, the, emir, routed, the, moroccans, and, imprisoned, them, following, this, failure, by, the, moroccans, an, assassin, was, sent, to, kill, emir, abdelkader, while, he, was, reading, he, raised, his, head, and, witnessed, a, large, powerful, assassin, armed, with, a, dagger, however, the, assassin, quickly, threw, the, dagger, to, the, ground, and, said, i, was, going, to, strike, you, but, the, sight, of, you, disarmed, me, i, thought, i, saw, the, halo, of, the, prophet, on, your, head, the, nephew, of, abd, al, rahman, moulay, hashem, was, sent, along, with, the, governor, of, the, rif, el, hamra, in, command, of, a, moroccan, army, to, attack, the, emir, however, the, moroccans, were, severely, defeated, in, battle, el, hamra, was, killed, moulay, hashem, had, barely, escaped, with, his, life, and, abd, al, rahman, accepted, this, defeat, the, moroccans, led, another, offensive, in, the, battle, of, agueddin, in, which, they, were, defeated, by, abdelkader, in, all, three, military, engagements, however, abdelkader, soon, made, the, choice, to, withdraw, from, morocco, and, enter, french, territory, for, negotiations, on, 23, december, 1847, abdelkader, surrendered, to, general, louis, juchault, de, lamorici, re, in, exchange, for, the, promise, that, he, would, be, allowed, to, go, to, alexandria, or, acre, he, supposedly, commented, on, his, own, surrender, with, the, words, and, god, undoes, what, my, hand, has, done, although, this, is, probably, apocryphal, his, request, was, granted, and, two, days, later, his, surrender, was, made, official, to, the, french, governor, general, of, algeria, henri, d, orl, ans, duke, of, aumale, to, whom, abdelkader, symbolically, handed, his, war, horse, ultimately, however, the, french, government, refused, to, honour, lamorici, re, s, promise, abdelkader, was, shipped, to, france, and, instead, of, being, allowed, to, carry, on, to, the, east, ended, up, being, kept, in, captivity, abdelkader, and, his, family, and, followers, were, detained, in, france, first, at, fort, lamalgue, in, toulon, then, at, pau, and, in, november, 1848, they, were, transferred, to, the, ch, teau, of, amboise, damp, conditions, in, the, castle, led, to, deteriorating, health, as, well, as, morale, in, the, emir, and, his, followers, and, his, fate, became, something, of, a, cause, c, l, bre, in, certain, circles, several, high, profile, figures, including, mile, de, girardin, and, victor, hugo, called, for, greater, clarification, over, the, emir, s, situation, future, prime, minister, mile, ollivier, carried, out, a, public, opinion, campaign, to, raise,

president, having, come, to, power, in, the, revolution, of, 1848, while, abdelkader, was, already, imprisoned, he, was, keen, to, make, a, break, with, several, policies, of, the, previous, regime, and, abdelkader, s, cause, was, one, of, them, eventually, on, 16, october, 1852, abdelkader, was, released, by, the, president, and, given, an, annual, pension, of, 100, 000, francs, on, taking, an,
