professional, magicians, would, come, to, regard, houdini, as, a, competent, but, not, particularly, skilled, sleight, of, hand, artist, lacking, the, grace, and, finesse, required, to, achieve, excellence, in, that, craft, he, soon, began, experimenting, with, escape, acts, in, the, early, 1890s, houdini, was, performing, with, his, brother, dash, theodore, as, the, brothers, houdini, 160,

escapes, he, was, first, stripped, nude, and, searched, in, moscow, he, escaped, from, a, siberian, prison, transport, van, 163, claiming, that, had, he, been, unable, to, free, himself, he, would, have, had, to, travel, to, siberia, where, the, only, key, was, kept, in, cologne, houdini, sued, a, police, officer, werner, graff, who, alleged, that, he, made, his, escapes, via, bribery, houdini,

made, for, queen, victoria, he, then, arranged, a, grand, reception, where, he, presented, his, mother, in, the, dress, to, all, their, relatives, houdini, said, it, was, the, happiest, day, of, his, life, in, 1904, houdini, returned, to, the, u, s, and, purchased, a, house, for, 25, 000, equivalent, to, 847, 778, in, 2023, a, brownstone, at, 278, w, 113th, street, in, harlem, new, york, city, while, on, tour, in, europe, in, 1902, houdini, visited, blois, with, the, aim, of, meeting, the, widow, of, emile, houdin, the, son, of, jean, eug, ne, robert, houdin, for, an, interview, and, permission, to, visit, his, grave, he, did, not, receive, permission, but, still, visited, the, grave, houdini, believed, that, he, had, been, treated, unfairly, and, later, wrote, a, negative, account, of, the, incident, in, his, magazine, claiming, he, was, treated, most, discourteously, by, madame, w, emile, robert, houdin, in, 1906, he, sent, a, letter, to, the, french, magazine, l, illusionniste, stating, you, will, certainly, enjoy, the, article, on, robert, houdin, i, am, about, to, publish, in, my, magazine, yes, my, dear, friend, i, think, i, can, finally, demolish, your, idol, who, has, so, long, been, placed, on, a, pedestal, that, he, did, not, deserve, in, 1906, houdini, created, his, own, publication, the, conjurers, monthly, magazine, it, was, a, competitor, to, the, sphinx, but, was, short, lived, and, only, two, volumes, were, released, until, august, 1908, magic, historian, jim, steinmeyer, has, noted, that, houdini, couldn, t, resist, using, the, journal, for, his, own, crusades, attacking, his, rivals, praising, his, own, appearances, and, subtly, rewriting, history, to, favor, his, view, of, magic, from, 1907, and, throughout, the, 1910s, houdini, performed, with, great, success, in, the, united, states, he, freed, himself, from, jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and, straitjackets, often, while, hanging, from, a, rope, in, sight, of, street, audiences, because, of, imitators, houdini, put, his, handcuff, act, behind, him, on, january, 25, 1908, and, began, escaping, from, a, locked, water, filled, milk, can, the, possibility, of, failure, and, death, thrilled, his, audiences, houdini, also, expanded, his, repertoire, with, his, escape, challenge, act, in, which, he, invited, the, public, to, devise, contraptions, to, hold, him, these, included, nailed, packing, crates, sometimes, lowered, into, water, riveted, boilers, wet, sheets, mail, bags, and, even, the, belly, of, a, whale, that, had, washed, ashore, in, boston, brewers, in, scranton, pennsylvania, and, other, cities, challenged, houdini, to, escape, from, a, barrel, after, they, filled, it, with, beer, many, of, these, challenges, were, arranged, with, local, merchants, in, one, of, the, first, uses, of, mass, tie, in, marketing, rather, than, promote, the, idea, that, he, was, assisted, by, spirits, as, did, the, davenport, brothers, and, others, houdini, s, advertisements, showed, him, making, his, escapes, via, dematerializing, although, houdini, himself, never, claimed, to, have, supernatural, powers, after, much, research, houdini, wrote, a, collection, of, articles, on, the, history, of, magic, which, were, expanded, into, the, unmasking, of, robert, houdin, published, in, 1908, in, this, book, he, attacked, his, former, idol, robert, houdin, as, a, liar, and, a, fraud, for, having, claimed, the, invention, of, automata, and, effects, such, as, aerial, suspension, which, had, been, in, existence, for, many, years, many, of, the, allegations, in, the, book, were, dismissed, by, magicians, and, researchers, who, defended, robert, houdin, magician, jean, hugard, would, later, write, a, full, rebuttal, to, houdini, s, book, houdini, introduced, the, chinese, water, torture, cell, at, the, circus, busch, in, berlin, germany, on, september, 21, 1912, he, was, suspended, upside, down, in, a, locked, glass, and, steel, cabinet, full, to, overflowing, with, water, holding, his, breath, for, more, than, three, minutes, he, would, go, on, performing, this, escape, for, the, rest, of, his, life, during, his, career, houdini, explained, some, of, his, tricks, in, books, written, for, the, magic, brotherhood, in, handcuff, secrets, 1909, he, revealed, how, many, locks, and, handcuffs, could, be, opened, with, properly, applied, force, others, with, shoestrings, other, times, he, carried, concealed, lockpicks, or, keys, when, tied, down, in, ropes, or, straitjackets, he, gained, wiggle, room, by, enlarging, his, shoulders, and, chest, moving, his, arms, slightly, away, from, his, body, his, straitjacket, escape, was, originally, performed, behind, curtains, with, him, popping, out, free, at, the, end, houdini, s, brother, who, was, also, an, escape, artist, billing, himself, as, theodore, hardeen, discovered, that, audiences, were, more, impressed, when, the, curtains, were, eliminated, so, they, could, watch, him, struggle, to, get, out, on, more, than, one, occasion, they, both, performed, straitjacket, escapes, while, dangling, upside, down, from, the, roof, of, a, building, in, the, same, city, for, most, of, his, career, houdini, was, a, headline, act, in, vaudeville, for, many, years, he, was, the, highest, paid, performer, in, american, vaudeville, one, of, houdini, s, most, notable, non, escape, stage, illusions, was, performed, at, the, new, york, hippodrome, when, he, vanished, a, full, grown, elephant, from, the, stage, he, had, purchased, this, trick, from, the, magician, charles, morritt, in, 1923, houdini, became, president, of, martinka, co, america, s, oldest, magic, company, the, business, is, still, in, operation, today, he, also, served, as, president, of, the, society, of, american, magicians, a, k, a, s, a, m, from, 1917, until, his, death, in, 1926, founded, on, may, 10, 1902, in, the, back, room, of, martinka, s, magic, shop, in, new, york, the, society, expanded, under, the, leadership, of, harry, houdini, during, his, term, as, national, president, from, 1917, to, 1926, houdini, was, magic, s, greatest, visionary, he, sought, to, create, a, large, unified, national, network, of, professional, and, amateur, magicians, wherever, he, traveled, he, gave, a, lengthy, formal, address, to, the, local, magic, club, made, speeches, and, usually, threw, a, banquet, for, the, members, at, his, own, expense, he, said, the, magicians, clubs, as, a, rule, are, small, they, are, weak, but, if, we, were, amalgamated, into, one, big, body, the, society, would, be, stronger, and, it, would, mean, making, the, small, clubs, powerful, and, worthwhile, members, would, find, a, welcome, wherever, they, happened, to, be, and, conversely, the, safeguard, of, a, city, to, city, hotline, to, track, exposers, and, other, undesirables, for, most, of, 1916, while, on, his, vaudeville, tour, houdini, had, been, recruiting, at, his, own, expense, local, magic, clubs, to, join, the, s, a, m, in, an, effort, to, revitalize, what, he, felt, was, a, weak, organization, houdini, persuaded, groups, in, buffalo, detroit, pittsburgh, and, kansas, city, to, join, as, had, happened, in, london, he, persuaded, magicians, to, join, the, buffalo, club, joined, as, the, first, branch, later, assembly, of, the, society, chicago, assembly, no, 3, was, as, the, name, implies, the, third, regional, club, to, be, established, by, the, s, a, m, whose, assemblies, now, number, in, the, hundreds, in, 1917, he, signed, assembly, number, three, s, charter, into, existence, and, that, charter, and, this, club, continue, to, provide, chicago, magicians, with, a, connection, to, each, other, and, to, their, past, houdini, dined, with, addressed, and, got, pledges, from, similar, clubs, in, detroit, rochester, pittsburgh, kansas, city, cincinnati, and, elsewhere, this, was, the, biggest, movement, ever, in, the, history, of, magic, in, places, where, no, clubs, existed, he, rounded, up, individual, magicians, introduced, them, to, each, other, and, urged, them, into, the, fold, by, the, end, of, 1916, magicians, clubs, in, san, francisco, and, other, cities, that, houdini, had, not, visited, were, offering, to, become, assemblies, he, had, created, the, richest, and, longest, surviving, organization, of, magicians, in, the, world, it, now, embraces, almost, 6, 000, dues, paying, members, and, almost, 300, assemblies, worldwide, in, july, 1926, houdini, was, elected, for, the, ninth, successive, time, president, of, the, society, of, american, magicians, every, other, president, has, only, served, for, one, year, he, also, was, president, of, the, magicians, club, of, london, in, the, final, years, of, his, life, 1925, 26, houdini, launched, his, own, full, evening, show, which, he, billed, as, three, shows, in, one, magic, escapes, and, fraud, mediums, exposed, in, 1904, the, london, daily, mirror, newspaper, challenged, houdini, to, escape, from, special, handcuffs, that, it, claimed, had, taken, nathaniel, hart, a, locksmith, from, birmingham, five, years, to, make, houdini, accepted, the, challenge, for, march, 17, during, a, matin, e, performance, at, london, s, hippodrome, theatre, it, was, reported, that, 4000, people, and, more, than, 100, journalists, turned, out, for, the, much, hyped, event, the, escape, attempt, dragged, on, for, over, an, hour, during, which, houdini, emerged, from, his, ghost, house, a, small, screen, used, to, conceal, the, method, of, his, escape, several, times, at, one, point, he, asked, if, the, cuffs, could, be, removed, so, he, could, take, off, his, coat, the, mirror, representative, frank, parker, refused, saying, houdini, could, gain, an, advantage, if, he, saw, how, the, cuffs, were, unlocked, houdini, promptly, took, out, a, penknife, and, holding, it, in, his, teeth, used, it, to, cut, his, coat, from, his, body, some, 56, minutes, later, houdini, s, wife, appeared, on, stage, and, gave, him, a, kiss, many, thought, that, in, her, mouth, was, the, key, to, unlock, the, special, handcuffs, however, it, has, since, been, suggested, that, bess, did, not, in, fact, enter, the, stage, at, all, and, that, this, theory, is, unlikely, due, to, the, size, of, the, six, inch, key, houdini, then, went, back, behind, the, curtain, after, an, hour, and, ten, minutes, houdini, emerged, free, as, he, was, paraded, on, the, shoulders, of, the, cheering, crowd, he, broke, down, and, wept, at, the, time, houdini, said, it, had, been, one, of, the, most, difficult, escapes, of, his, career, after, houdini, s, death, his, friend, martin, beck, was, quoted, in, will, goldston, s, book, sensational, tales, of, mystery, men, admitting, that, houdini, was, bested, that, day, and, had, appealed, to, his, wife, bess, for, help, goldston, goes, on, to, claim, that, bess, begged, the, key, from, the, mirror, representative, then, slipped, it, to, houdini, in, a, glass, of, water, it, was, stated, in, the, book, the, secret, life, of, houdini, that, the, key, required, to, open, the, specially, designed, mirror, handcuffs, was, six, inches, long, and, could, not, have, been, smuggled, to, houdini, in, a, glass, of, water, goldston, offered, no, proof, of, his, account, and, many, modern, biographers, have, found, evidence, notably, in, the, custom, design, of, the, handcuffs, that, the, mirror, challenge, may, have, been, arranged, by, houdini, and, that, his, long, struggle, to, escape, was, pure, showmanship, james, randi, believes, that, the, only, way, the, handcuffs, could, have, been, opened, was, by, using, their, key, and, speculates, that, it, would, have, been, viewed, distasteful, to, both, the, mirror, and, to, houdini, if, houdini, had, failed, the, escape, 165, this, escape, was, discussed, in, depth, on, the, travel, channel, s, mysteries, at, the, museum, in, an, interview, with, houdini, expert, magician, and, escape, artist, dorothy, dietrich, of, scranton, s, houdini, museum, a, full, sized, construction, of, the, same, mirror, handcuffs, as, well, as, a, replica, of, the, bramah, style, key, for, them, are, on, display, to, the, public, at, the, houdini, museum, in, scranton, pennsylvania, this, set, of, cuffs, is, believed, to, be, one, of, only, six, in, the, world, some, of, which, are, not, on, display, in, 1908, houdini, introduced, his, own, original, act, the, milk, can, escape, 175, 178, in, this, act, houdini, was, handcuffed, and, sealed, inside, an, oversized, milk, can, filled, with, water, and, made, his, escape, behind, a, curtain, as, part, of, the, effect, houdini, invited, members, of, the, audience, to, hold, their, breath, along, with, him, while, he, was, inside, the, can, advertised, with, dramatic, posters, that, proclaimed, failure, means, a, drowning, death, the, escape, proved, to, be, a, sensation, 177, houdini, soon, modified, the, escape, to, include, the, milk, can, being, locked, inside, a, wooden, chest, being, chained, or, padlocked, houdini, performed, the, milk, can, escape, as, a, regular, part, of, his, act, for, only, four, years, but, it, has, remained, one, of, the, acts, most, associated, with, him, houdini, s, brother, theodore, hardeen, continued, to, perform, the, milk, can, escape, and, its, wooden, chest, variant, into, the, 1940s, the, american, museum, of, magic, has, the, milk, can, and, overboard, box, used, by, houdini, after, other, magicians, proposed, variations, on, the, milk, can, escape, houdini, claimed, that, the, act, was, protected, by, copyright, and, in, 1906, brought, a, case, against, john, clempert, one, of, the, most, persistent, imitators, the, matter, was, settled, out, of, court, and, clempert, agreed, to, publish, an, apology, around, 1912, the, vast, number, of, imitators, prompted, houdini, to, replace, his, milk, can, act, with, the, chinese, water, torture, cell, in, this, escape, houdini, s, feet, were, locked, in, stocks, and, he, was, lowered, upside, down, into, a, tank, filled, with, water, the, mahogany, and, metal, cell, featured, a, glass, front, through, which, audiences, could, clearly, see, houdini, the, stocks, were, locked, to, the, top, of, the, cell, and, a, curtain, concealed, his, escape, in, the, earliest, version, of, the, torture, cell, a, metal, cage, was, lowered, into, the, cell, and, houdini, was, enclosed, inside, that, while, making, the, escape, more, difficult, the, cage, prevented, houdini, from, turning, the, cage, bars, also, offered, protection, should, the, front, glass, break, the, original, cell, was, built, in, england, where, houdini, first, performed, the, escape, for, an, audience, of, one, person, as, part, of, a, one, act, play, he, called, houdini, upside, down, this, was, done, to, obtain, copyright, protection, for, the, effect, and, establish, grounds, to, sue, imitators, which, he, did, while, the, escape, was, advertised, as, the, chinese, water, torture, cell, or, the, water, torture, cell, houdini, always, referred, to, it, as, the, upside, down, or, usd, the, first, public, performance, of, the, usd, was, at, the, circus, busch, in, berlin, on, september, 21, 1912, houdini, continued, to, perform, the, escape, until, his, death, in, 1926, one, of, houdini, s, most, popular, publicity, stunts, was, to, have, himself, strapped, into, a, regulation, straitjacket, and, suspended, by, his, ankles, from, a, tall, building, or, crane, houdini, would, then, make, his, escape, in, full, view, of, the, assembled, crowd, in, many, cases, houdini, drew, tens, of, thousands, of, onlookers, who, brought, city, traffic, to, a, halt, houdini, would, sometimes, ensure, press, coverage, by, performing, the, escape, from, the, office, building, of, a, local, newspaper, in, new, york, city, houdini, performed, the, suspended, straitjacket, escape, from, a, crane, being, used, to, build, the, subway, after, flinging, his, body, in, the, air, he, escaped, from, the, straitjacket, starting, from, when, he, was, hoisted, up, in, the, air, by, the, crane, to, when, the, straitjacket, was, completely, off, it, took, him, two, minutes, and, thirty, seven, seconds, there, is, film, footage, in, the, library, of, congress, of, houdini, performing, the, escape, films, of, his, escapes, are, also, shown, at, the, houdini, museum, in, scranton, pennsylvania, after, being, battered, against, a, building, in, high, winds, during, one, escape, houdini, performed, the, escape, with, a, visible, safety, wire, on, his, ankle, so, that, he, could, be, pulled, away, from, the, building, if, necessary, the, idea, for, the, upside, down, escape, was, given, to, houdini, by, a, young, boy, named, randolph, osborne, douglas, march, 31, 1895, december, 5, 1956, when, the, two, met, at, a, performance, at, sheffield, s, empire, theatre, another, of, houdini, s, most, famous, publicity, stunts, was, to, escape, from, a, nailed, and, roped, packing, crate, after, it, had, been, lowered, into, water, he, first, performed, the, escape, in, new, york, s, east, river, on, july, 7, 1912, police, forbade, him, from, using, one, of, the, piers, so, he, hired, a, tugboat, and, invited, press, on, board, houdini, was, locked, in, handcuffs, and, leg, irons, then, nailed, into, the, crate, which, was, roped, and, weighed, down, with, two, hundred, pounds, of, lead, the, crate, was, then, lowered, into, the, water, he, escaped, in, 57, seconds, the, crate, was, pulled, to, the, surface, and, found, still, to, be, intact, with, the, manacles, inside, houdini, performed, this, escape, many, times, and, even, performed, a, version, on, stage, first, at, hamerstein, s, roof, garden, where, a, 5, 500, us, gallon, 21, 000, l, tank, was, specially, built, and, later, at, the, new, york, hippodrome, houdini, performed, at, least, three, variations, on, a, buried, alive, stunt, during, his, career, the, first, was, near, santa, ana, california, in, 1915, and, it, almost, cost, him, his, life, houdini, was, buried, without, a, casket, in, a, pit, of, earth, six, feet, deep, he, became, exhausted, and, panicked, while, trying, to, dig, his, way, to, the, surface, and, called, for, help, when, his, hand, finally, broke, the, surface, he, fell, unconscious, and, had, to, be, pulled, from, the, grave, by, his, assistants, houdini, wrote, in, his, diary, that, the, escape, was, very, dangerous, and, that, the, weight, of, the, earth, is, killing, houdini, s, second, variation, on, buried, alive, was, an, endurance, test, designed, to, expose, mystical, egyptian, performer, rahman, bey, who, had, claimed, to, use, supernatural, powers, to, remain, in, a, sealed, casket, for, an, hour, houdini, bettered, bey, on, august, 5, 1926, by, remaining, in, a, sealed, casket, or, coffin, submerged, in, the, swimming, pool, of, new, york, s, hotel, shelton, for, one, and, a, half, hours, houdini, claimed, he, did, not, use, any, trickery, or, supernatural, powers, to, accomplish, this, feat, just, controlled, breathing, he, repeated, the, feat, at, the, ymca, in, worcester, massachusetts, on, september, 28, 1926, this, time, remaining, sealed, for, one, hour, and, eleven, minutes, houdini, s, final, buried, alive, was, an, elaborate, stage, escape, that, featured, in, his, full, evening, show, houdini, would, escape, after, being, strapped, in, a, straitjacket, sealed, in, a, casket, and, then, buried, in, a, large, tank, filled, with, sand, while, posters, advertising, the, escape, exist, playing, off, the, bey, challenge, by, boasting, egyptian, fakirs, outdone, it, is, unclear, whether, houdini, ever, performed, buried, alive, on, stage, the, stunt, was, to, be, the, feature, escape, of, his, 1927, season, but, houdini, died, on, october, 31, 1926, the, bronze, casket, houdini, created, for, buried, alive, was, used, to, transport, houdini, s, body, from, detroit, to, new, york, following, his, death, on, halloween, in, 1906, houdini, started, showing, films, of, his, outside, escapes, as, part, of, his, vaudeville, act, in, boston, he, presented, a, short, film, called, houdini, defeats, hackenschmidt, georg, hackenschmidt, was, a, famous, wrestler, of, the, day, but, the, nature, of, their, contest, is, unknown, as, the, film, is, lost, in, 1909, houdini, made, a, film, in, paris, for, cinema, lux, titled, merveilleux, exploits, du, c, l, bre, houdini, paris, marvellous, exploits, of, the, famous, houdini, in, paris, it, featured, a, loose, narrative, designed, to, showcase, several, of, houdini, s, famous, escapes, including, his, straitjacket, and, underwater, handcuff, escapes, that, same, year, houdini, got, an, offer, to, star, as, captain, nemo, in, a, silent, version, of, twenty, thousand, leagues, under, the, seas, but, the, project, never, made, it, into, production, it, is, often, erroneously, reported, that, houdini, served, as, special, effects, consultant, on, the, wharton, international, cliffhanger, serial, the, mysteries, of, myra, shot, in, ithaca, new, york, because, harry, grossman, director, of, the, master, mystery, also, filmed, a, serial, in, ithaca, at, about, the, same, time, the, consultants, on, the, serial, were, pioneering, hereward, carrington, and, aleister, crowley, in, 1918, houdini, signed, a, contract, with, film, producer, b, a, rolfe, to, star, in, a, 15, part, serial, the, master, mystery, released, in, november, 1918, as, was, common, at, the, time, the, film, serial, was, released, simultaneously, with, a, novel, financial, difficulties, resulted, in, b, a, rolfe, productions, going, out, of, business, but, the, master, mystery, led, to, houdini, being, signed, by, famous, players, lasky, corporation, paramount, pictures, for, whom, he, made, two, pictures, the, grim, game, 1919, and, terror, island, 1920, the, grim, game, was, houdini, s, first, full, length, movie, and, is, reputed, to, be, his, best, because, of, the, flammable, nature, of, nitrate, film, and, their, low, rate, of, survival, film, historians, considered, the, film, lost, one, copy, did, exist, hidden, in, the, collection, of, a, private, collector, only, known, to, a, tiny, group, of, magicians, that, saw, it, dick, brookz, and, dorothy, dietrich, of, the, houdini, museum, in, scranton, pennsylvania, had, seen, it, twice, on, the, invitation, of, the, collector, after, many, years, of, trying, they, finally, got, him,

houdini, is, located, on, 2400, laurel, canyon, boulevard, previously, home, to, walker, himself, the, houdini, estate, is, subject, to, controversy, in, that, it, is, disputed, whether, houdini, ever, actually, made, it, his, home, while, there, are, claims, it, was, houdini, s, house, others, counter, that, he, never, set, foot, on, the, property, it, is, rooted, in, bess, s, parties, or,

his, australia, tour, houdini, put, the, voisin, into, storage, in, england, he, announced, he, would, use, it, to, fly, from, city, to, city, during, his, next, music, hall, tour, and, even, promised, to, leap, from, it, handcuffed, but, he, never, flew, again, in, the, 1920s, houdini, turned, his, energies, toward, debunking, psychics, and, mediums, in, order, to, show, how, they, were, taking, advantage, of, the, bereaved, 166, a, pursuit, that, was, in, line, with, the, debunkings, by, stage, magicians, since, the, late, nineteenth, century, houdini, s, training, in, magic, allowed, him, to, expose, frauds, who, had, successfully, fooled, many, scientists, and, academics, he, was, a, member, of, a, scientific, american, committee, that, offered, a, cash, prize, to, any, medium, who, could, successfully, demonstrate, supernatural, abilities, none, were, able, to, do, so, and, the, prize, was, never, collected, the, first, to, be, tested, was, medium, george, valiantine, of, wilkes, barre, pennsylvania, as, his, fame, as, a, medium, buster, grew, houdini, took, to, attending, s, ances, in, disguise, accompanied, by, a, reporter, and, a, police, officer, possibly, the, most, famous, medium, he, debunked, was, mina, crandon, also, known, as, margery, joaqu, n, argamasilla, known, as, the, spaniard, with, x, ray, eyes, claimed, to, be, able, to, read, handwriting, or, numbers, on, dice, through, closed, metal, boxes, in, 1924, he, was, exposed, by, houdini, as, a, fraud, argamasilla, peeked, through, his, simple, blindfold, and, lifted, up, the, edge, of, the, box, so, he, could, look, inside, it, without, others, noticing, houdini, also, investigated, the, italian, medium, nino, pecoraro, who, he, considered, to, be, fraudulent, houdini, s, exposure, of, phony, mediums, inspired, other, magicians, to, follow, suit, including, the, amazing, randi, dorothy, dietrich, penn, teller, and, dick, brookz, houdini, chronicled, his, debunking, exploits, in, his, book, a, magician, among, the, spirits, co, authored, with, c, m, eddy, jr, who, was, not, credited, these, activities, compromised, houdini, s, friendship, with, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, doyle, a, firm, believer, in, spiritualism, during, his, later, years, refused, to, give, credence, to, any, of, houdini, s, expos, s, doyle, came, to, believe, that, houdini, was, a, powerful, spiritualist, medium, and, had, performed, many, of, his, stunts, by, means, of, paranormal, abilities, and, was, using, those, abilities, to, block, the, powers, of, the, mediums, that, he, was, supposedly, debunking, this, disagreement, led, to, the, two, men, becoming, public, antagonists, and, doyle, came, to, view, houdini, as, a, dangerous, enemy, before, houdini, died, he, and, his, wife, agreed, that, if, houdini, found, it, possible, to, communicate, after, death, he, would, communicate, the, message, rosabelle, believe, a, secret, code, which, they, agreed, to, use, rosabelle, was, their, favorite, song, bess, held, yearly, s, ances, on, halloween, for, ten, years, after, houdini, s, death, she, did, claim, to, have, contact, through, arthur, ford, in, 1929, when, ford, conveyed, the, secret, code, but, bess, later, said, the, incident, had, been, faked, the, code, seems, to, have, been, such, that, it, could, be, broken, by, ford, or, his, associates, using, existing, clues, evidence, to, this, effect, was, discovered, by, ford, s, biographer, after, he, died, in, 1971, in, 1936, after, a, last, unsuccessful, s, ance, on, the, roof, of, the, knickerbocker, hotel, she, put, out, the, candle, that, she, had, kept, burning, beside, a, photograph, of, houdini, since, his, death, in, 1943, bess, said, that, ten, years, is, long, enough, to, wait, for, any, man, the, tradition, of, holding, a, s, ance, for, houdini, continues, held, by, magicians, throughout, the, world, the, official, houdini, s, ance, was, organized, in, the, 1940s, by, sidney, hollis, radner, a, houdini, aficionado, from, holyoke, massachusetts, yearly, houdini, s, ances, are, also, conducted, in, chicago, at, the, excalibur, nightclub, by, necromancer, neil, tobin, on, behalf, of, the, chicago, assembly, of, the, society, of, american, magicians, and, at, the, houdini, museum, in, scranton, by, magician, dorothy, dietrich, who, previously, held, them, at, new, york, s, magic, towne, house, with, such, magical, notables, as, houdini, biographers, walter, b, gibson, and, milbourne, christopher, gibson, was, asked, by, bess, houdini, to, carry, on, the, original, s, ance, tradition, after, doing, them, for, many, years, at, new, york, s, magic, towne, house, before, he, died, walter, passed, on, the, tradition, of, conducting, of, the, original, s, ances, to, dorothy, dietrich, in, 1926, harry, houdini, hired, h, p, lovecraft, and, his, friend, c, m, eddy, jr, to, write, an, entire, book, about, debunking, religious, miracles, which, was, to, be, called, the, cancer, of, superstition, houdini, had, earlier, asked, lovecraft, to, write, an, article, about, astrology, for, which, he, paid, 75, equivalent, to, 1, 291, in, 2023, the, article, does, not, survive, lovecraft, s, detailed, synopsis, for, cancer, does, survive, as, do, three, chapters, of, the, treatise, written, by, eddy, houdini, s, death, derailed, the, plans, as, his, widow, did, not, wish, to, pursue, the, project, unlike, the, image, of, the, classic, magician, houdini, was, short, and, stocky, and, typically, appeared, on, stage, in, a, long, frock, coat, and, tie, most, biographers, give, his, height, as, 5, feet, 5, inches, 1, 65, m, but, descriptions, vary, houdini, was, also, said, to, be, slightly, bow, legged, which, aided, in, his, ability, to, gain, slack, during, his, rope, escapes, in, the, 1997, biography, houdini, the, career, of, ehrich, weiss, author, kenneth, silverman, summarizes, how, reporters, described, houdini, s, appearance, during, his, early, career, they, stressed, his, smallness, somewhat, undersized, and, angular, vivid, features, he, is, smooth, shaven, with, a, keen, sharp, chinned, sharp, cheekboned, face, bright, blue, eyes, and, thick, curly, black, hair, some, sensed, how, much, his, complexly, expressive, smile, was, the, outlet, of, his, charismatic, stage, presence, it, communicated, to, audiences, at, once, warm, amiability, pleasure, in, performing, and, more, subtly, imperious, self, assurance, several, reporters, tried, to, capture, the, charming, effect, describing, him, as, happy, looking, pleasant, faced, good, natured, at, all, times, the, young, hungarian, magician, with, the, pleasant, smile, and, easy, confidence, houdini, made, the, only, known, recordings, of, his, voice, on, edison, wax, cylinders, on, october, 29, 1914, in, flatbush, new, york, on, them, houdini, practices, several, different, introductory, speeches, for, his, famous, chinese, water, torture, cell, he, also, invites, his, sister, gladys, to, recite, a, poem, houdini, then, recites, the, same, poem, in, german, the, six, wax, cylinders, were, discovered, in, the, collection, of, magician, john, mulholland, after, his, death, in, 1970, they, are, part, of, the, david, copperfield, collection, in, september, 1900, houdini, was, summoned, by, the, german, police, prior, to, his, first, performance, in, the, country, who, suspected, his, act, was, fake, subsequently, in, berlin, he, was, stripped, naked, and, forced, to, perform, an, escape, routine, in, front, of, 300, policemen, houdini, was, tightly, restrained, with, thumbscrews, finger, locks, and, five, different, hand, and, elbow, irons, he, was, able, to, escape, in, 6, minutes, and, later, used, the, stunt, in, advertising, subsequently, in, 1901, a, newspaper, in, cologne, accused, him, of, attempting, to, bribe, a, police, officer, in, order, to, rig, an, escape, attempt, and, paying, a, civilian, police, employee, to, aid, him, with, another, performance, houdini, sued, the, newspaper, and, the, police, officer, for, slander, as, part, of, the, trial, houdini, was, asked, to, open, without, the, aid, of, tools, one, of, the, police, officer, s, handcrafted, locks, for, which, the, officer, had, said, that, houdini, had, tried, to, bribe, him, houdini, was, able, to, do, so, and, won, the, case, houdini, became, an, active, freemason, and, was, a, member, of, st, cecile, lodge, no, 568, in, new, york, city, in, 1904, houdini, bought, a, new, york, city, townhouse, at, 278, west, 113th, street, in, harlem, he, paid, us, 25, 000, equivalent, to, 847, 778, in, 2023, for, the, five, level, 6, 008, square, foot, house, which, was, built, in, 1895, and, lived, in, it, with, his, wife, bess, and, various, other, relatives, until, his, death, in, 1926, in, march, 2018, it, was, purchased, for, 3, 6, million, a, plaque, affixed, to, the, building, by, the, historical, landmark, preservation, center, reads, the, magician, lived, here, from, 1904, to, 1926, collecting, illusions, theatrical, memorabilia, and, books, on, psychic, phenomena, and, magic, in, 1919, houdini, moved, to, los, angeles, to, film, he, resided, in, 2435, laurel, canyon, boulevard, a, house, of, his, friend, and, business, associate, ralph, m, walker, who, owned, both, sides, of, the, street, 2335, and, 2400, the, latter, address, having, a, pool, where, houdini, practiced, his, water, escapes, 2400, laurel, canyon, boulevard, previously, numbered, 2398, is, presently, known, as, the, houdini, estate, thus, named, in, the, honor, of, houdini, s, time, there, the, same, estate, where, bess, houdini, threw, a, party, for, 500, magicians, years, after, his, death, after, decades, of, abandonment, the, estate, was, acquired, in, 2006, by, jos, luis, nazar, a, chilean, american, citizen, who, has, restored, it, to, its, former, splendor, in, 1918, he, registered, for, selective, service, as, harry, handcuff, houdini, houdini, died, on, october, 31, 1926, at, the, age, of, 52, from, peritonitis, swelling, of, the, abdomen, possibly, related, to, appendicitis, and, possibly, related, to, punches, to, his, stomach, he, had, received, about, a, week, and, a, half, earlier, witnesses, to, an, incident, at, houdini, s, dressing, room, in, the, princess, theatre, in, montreal, on, october, 22, 1926, speculated, that, houdini, s, death, was, caused, by, jocelyn, gordon, whitehead, 1895, 1954, who, repeatedly, struck, houdini, s, abdomen, the, accounts, of, the, witnesses, students, named, jacques, price, and, sam, smilovitz, sometimes, called, jack, price, and, sam, smiley, generally, corroborated, each, other, price, said, that, whitehead, asked, houdini, if, he, believed, in, the, miracles, of, the, bible, and, whether, it, was, true, that, punches, in, the, stomach, did, not, hurt, him, houdini, offered, a, casual, reply, that, his, stomach, could, endure, a, lot, whitehead, then, delivered, some, very, hammer, like, blows, below, the, belt, houdini, was, reclining, on, a, couch, at, the, time, having, broken, his, ankle, while, performing, several, days, earlier, price, said, that, houdini, winced, at, each, blow, and, stopped, whitehead, suddenly, in, the, midst, of, a, punch, gesturing, that, he, had, had, enough, and, adding, that, he, had, had, no, opportunity, to, prepare, himself, against, the, blows, as, he, did, not, expect, whitehead, to, strike, him, so, suddenly, and, forcefully, had, his, ankle, not, been, broken, he, would, have, risen, from, the, couch, into, a, better, position, to, brace, himself, throughout, the, evening, houdini, performed, in, great, pain, he, had, insomnia, and, remained, in, constant, pain, for, the, next, two, days, but, did, not, seek, medical, help, when, he, finally, saw, a, doctor, he, was, found, to, have, a, fever, of, 102, f, 39, c, and, acute, appendicitis, and, was, advised, to, have, immediate, surgery, he, ignored, the, advice, and, decided, to, go, on, with, the, show, when, houdini, arrived, at, the, garrick, theater, in, detroit, michigan, on, october, 24, 1926, for, what, would, be, his, last, performance, he, had, a, fever, of, 104, f, 40, c, despite, the, diagnosis, houdini, took, the, stage, he, was, reported, to, have, passed, out, during, the, show, but, was, revived, and, continued, afterwards, he, was, hospitalized, at, detroit, s, grace, hospital, where, he, died, from, peritonitis, on, october, 31, aged, 52, it, is, unclear, whether, the, dressing, room, incident, caused, houdini, s, eventual, death, as, the, relationship, between, blunt, trauma, and, appendicitis, is, uncertain, one, theory, suggests, that, houdini, was, unaware, that, he, was, suffering, from, appendicitis, and, he, might, have, taken, his, abdominal, pain, more, seriously, had, he, not, coincidentally, received, blows, to, the, abdomen, after, taking, statements, from, price, and,
