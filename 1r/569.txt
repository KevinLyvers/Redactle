guitar, skills, and, songwriting, talent, that, has, influenced, later, generations, of, musicians, although, his, recording, career, spanned, only, seven, months, he, is, recognized, as, a, master, of, the, blues, particularly, the, delta, blues, style, and, as, one, of, the, most, influential, musicians, of, the, 20th, century, the, rock, and, roll, hall, of, fame, describes, him, as, perhaps, the, first, ever, rock, star, as, a, traveling, performer, who, played, mostly, on, street, corners, in, juke, joints, and, at, saturday, night, dances, johnson, had, little, commercial, success, or, public, recognition, in, his, lifetime, he, participated, in, only, two, recording, sessions, one, in, san, antonio, in, 1936, and, one, in, dallas, in, 1937, that, produced, 29, distinct, songs, with, 13, surviving, alternate, takes, recorded, by, don, law, these, songs, recorded, solo, in, improvised, studios, were, the, totality, of, his, recorded, output, most, were, released, as, 10, inch, 78, rpm, singles, from, 1937, 1938, with, a, few, released, after, his, death, other, than, these, recordings, very, little, was, known, of, his, life, outside, of, the, small, musical, circuit, in, the, mississippi, delta, where, he, spent, most, of, his, time, much, of, his, story, has, been, reconstructed, by, researchers, johnson, s, poorly, documented, life, and, death, have, given, rise, to, legends, the, one, most, often, associated, with, him, is, that, he, sold, his, soul, to, the, devil, at, a, local, crossroads, in, return, for, musical, success, his, music, had, a, small, but, influential, following, during, his, life, and, in, the, two, decades, after, his, death, in, late, 1938, john, hammond, sought, him, out, for, a, concert, at, carnegie, hall, from, spirituals, to, swing, only, to, discover, that, johnson, had, died, brunswick, records, which, owned, the, original, recordings, was, bought, by, columbia, records, where, hammond, was, employed, musicologist, alan, lomax, went, to, mississippi, in, 1941, to, record, johnson, also, not, knowing, of, his, death, law, who, by, then, worked, for, columbia, records, assembled, a, collection, of, johnson, s, recordings, titled, king, of, the, delta, blues, singers, that, was, released, by, columbia, in, 1961, it, is, credited, with, finally, bringing, johnson, s, work, to, a, wider, audience, the, album, would, become, influential, especially, in, the, nascent, british, blues, movement, eric, clapton, has, called, johnson, the, most, important, blues, singer, that, ever, lived, bob, dylan, keith, richards, and, robert, plant, have, cited, both, johnson, s, lyrics, and, musicianship, as, key, influences, on, their, own, work, many, of, johnson, s, songs, have, been, covered, over, the, years, becoming, hits, for, other, artists, and, his, guitar, licks, and, lyrics, have, been, borrowed, by, many, later, musicians, renewed, interest, in, johnson, s, work, and, life, led, to, a, burst, of, scholarship, starting, in, the, 1960s, much, of, what, is, known, about, him, was, reconstructed, by, researchers, such, as, gayle, dean, wardlow, and, bruce, conforth, especially, in, their, 2019, award, winning, biography, of, johnson, up, jumped, the, devil, the, real, life, of, robert, johnson, chicago, review, press, two, films, the, 1991, documentary, the, search, for, robert, johnson, by, john, hammond, jr, and, a, 1997, documentary, can, t, you, hear, the, wind, howl, the, life, music, of, robert, johnson, which, included, reconstructed, scenes, with, keb, mo, as, johnson, were, attempts, to, document, his, life, and, demonstrated, the, difficulties, arising, from, the, scant, historical, record, and, conflicting, oral, accounts, over, the, years, the, significance, of, johnson, and, his, music, has, been, recognized, by, the, rock, and, roll, grammy, and, blues, halls, of, fame, and, by, the, national, recording, preservation, board, robert, leroy, johnson, was, born, in, hazlehurst, mississippi, possibly, on, may, 8, 1911, to, julia, major, dodds, born, october, 1874, and, noah, johnson, born, december, 1884, julia, was, married, to, charles, dodds, born, february, 1865, a, relatively, prosperous, landowner, and, furniture, maker, with, whom, she, had, ten, children, charles, dodds, had, been, forced, by, a, lynch, mob, to, leave, hazlehurst, following, a, dispute, with, white, landowners, julia, left, hazlehurst, with, baby, robert, but, in, less, than, two, years, she, brought, the, boy, to, memphis, to, live, with, her, husband, who, had, changed, his, name, to, charles, spencer, robert, spent, the, next, 8, 9, years, growing, up, in, memphis, and, attending, the, carnes, avenue, colored, school, where, he, received, lessons, in, arithmetic, reading, language, music, geography, and, physical, exercise, it, was, in, memphis, that, he, acquired, his, love, for, and, knowledge, of, the, blues, and, popular, music, his, education, and, urban, context, placed, him, apart, from, most, of, his, contemporary, blues, musicians, robert, rejoined, his, mother, around, 1919, 1920, after, she, married, an, illiterate, sharecropper, named, will, dusty, willis, they, originally, settled, on, a, plantation, in, lucas, township, in, crittenden, county, arkansas, but, soon, moved, across, the, mississippi, river, to, commerce, in, the, mississippi, delta, near, tunica, and, robinsonville, they, lived, on, the, abbay, leatherman, plantation, julia, s, new, husband, was, 24, years, her, junior, robert, was, remembered, by, some, residents, as, little, robert, dusty, but, he, was, registered, at, tunica, s, indian, creek, school, as, robert, spencer, in, the, 1920, census, he, is, listed, as, robert, spencer, living, in, lucas, arkansas, with, will, and, julia, willis, robert, was, at, school, in, 1924, and, 1927, the, quality, of, his, signature, on, his, marriage, certificate, suggests, that, he, was, relatively, well, educated, for, a, man, of, his, background, a, school, friend, willie, coffee, who, was, interviewed, and, filmed, in, later, life, recalled, that, as, a, youth, robert, was, already, noted, for, playing, the, harmonica, and, jaw, harp, coffee, recalled, that, robert, was, absent, for, long, periods, which, suggests, that, he, may, have, been, living, and, studying, in, memphis, once, julia, informed, robert, about, his, biological, father, robert, adopted, the, surname, johnson, using, it, on, the, certificate, of, his, marriage, to, fourteen, year, old, virginia, travis, in, february, 1929, she, died, in, childbirth, shortly, after, surviving, relatives, of, virginia, told, the, blues, researcher, robert, mack, mccormick, that, this, was, a, divine, punishment, for, robert, s, decision, to, sing, secular, songs, known, as, selling, your, soul, to, the, devil, mccormick, believed, that, johnson, himself, accepted, the, phrase, as, a, description, of, his, resolve, to, abandon, the, settled, life, of, a, husband, and, farmer, to, become, a, full, time, blues, musician, around, this, time, the, blues, musician, son, house, moved, to, robinsonville, where, his, musical, partner, willie, brown, lived, late, in, life, house, remembered, johnson, as, a, little, boy, who, was, a, competent, harmonica, player, but, an, embarrassingly, bad, guitarist, soon, after, johnson, left, robinsonville, for, the, area, around, martinsville, close, to, his, birthplace, possibly, searching, for, his, natural, father, here, he, perfected, the, guitar, style, of, house, and, learned, other, styles, from, isaiah, ike, zimmerman, zimmerman, was, rumored, to, have, learned, supernaturally, to, play, guitar, by, visiting, graveyards, at, midnight, when, johnson, next, appeared, in, robinsonville, he, seemed, to, have, miraculously, acquired, a, guitar, technique, house, was, interviewed, at, a, time, when, the, legend, of, johnson, s, pact, with, the, devil, was, well, known, among, blues, researchers, he, was, asked, whether, he, attributed, johnson, s, technique, to, this, pact, and, his, equivocal, answers, have, been, taken, as, confirmation, while, living, in, martinsville, johnson, fathered, a, child, with, vergie, mae, smith, he, married, caletta, craft, in, may, 1931, in, 1932, the, couple, settled, for, a, while, in, clarksdale, mississippi, in, the, delta, but, johnson, soon, left, for, a, career, as, a, walking, or, itinerant, musician, and, caletta, died, in, early, 1933, from, 1932, until, his, death, in, 1938, johnson, moved, frequently, between, the, cities, of, memphis, and, helena, and, the, smaller, towns, of, the, mississippi, delta, and, neighboring, regions, of, mississippi, and, arkansas, on, occasion, he, traveled, much, further, the, blues, musician, johnny, shines, accompanied, him, to, chicago, texas, new, york, canada, kentucky, and, indiana, henry, townsend, shared, a, musical, engagement, with, him, in, st, louis, in, many, places, he, stayed, with, members, of, his, large, extended, family, or, with, female, friends, he, did, not, marry, again, but, formed, some, long, term, relationships, with, women, to, whom, he, would, return, periodically, in, other, places, he, stayed, with, whatever, woman, he, was, able, to, seduce, at, his, performance, in, each, location, johnson, s, hosts, were, largely, ignorant, of, his, life, elsewhere, he, used, different, names, in, different, places, employing, at, least, eight, distinct, surnames, biographers, have, looked, for, consistency, from, musicians, who, knew, johnson, in, different, contexts, shines, who, traveled, extensively, with, him, robert, lockwood, jr, who, knew, him, as, his, mother, s, partner, david, honeyboy, edwards, whose, cousin, willie, mae, powell, had, a, relationship, with, johnson, from, a, mass, of, partial, conflicting, and, inconsistent, eyewitness, accounts, biographers, have, attempted, to, summarize, johnson, s, character, he, was, well, mannered, he, was, soft, spoken, he, was, indecipherable, as, for, his, character, everyone, seems, to, agree, that, while, he, was, pleasant, and, outgoing, in, public, in, private, he, was, reserved, and, liked, to, go, his, own, way, musicians, who, knew, johnson, testified, that, he, was, a, nice, guy, and, fairly, average, except, of, course, for, his, musical, talent, his, weakness, for, whiskey, and, women, and, his, commitment, to, the, road, when, johnson, arrived, in, a, new, town, he, would, play, for, tips, on, street, corners, or, in, front, of, the, local, barbershop, or, a, restaurant, musical, associates, have, said, that, in, live, performances, johnson, often, did, not, focus, on, his, dark, and, complex, original, compositions, but, instead, pleased, audiences, by, performing, more, well, known, pop, standards, of, the, day, and, not, necessarily, blues, with, an, ability, to, pick, up, tunes, at, first, hearing, he, had, no, trouble, giving, his, audiences, what, they, wanted, and, certain, of, his, contemporaries, later, remarked, on, his, interest, in, jazz, and, country, music, he, also, had, an, uncanny, ability, to, establish, a, rapport, with, his, audience, in, every, town, in, which, he, stopped, he, would, establish, ties, to, the, local, community, that, would, serve, him, well, when, he, passed, through, again, a, month, or, a, year, later, shines, was, 20, when, he, met, johnson, in, 1936, he, estimated, johnson, was, maybe, a, year, older, than, himself, johnson, was, actually, four, years, older, shines, is, quoted, describing, johnson, in, samuel, charters, s, robert, johnson, robert, was, a, very, friendly, person, even, though, he, was, sulky, at, times, you, know, and, i, hung, around, robert, for, quite, a, while, one, evening, he, disappeared, he, was, kind, of, a, peculiar, fellow, robert, d, be, standing, up, playing, some, place, playing, like, nobody, s, business, at, about, that, time, it, was, a, hustle, with, him, as, well, as, a, pleasure, and, money, d, be, coming, from, all, directions, but, robert, d, just, pick, up, and, walk, off, and, leave, you, standing, there, playing, and, you, wouldn, t, see, robert, no, more, maybe, in, two, or, three, weeks, so, robert, and, i, we, began, journeying, off, i, was, just, matter, of, fact, tagging, along, during, this, time, johnson, established, what, would, be, a, relatively, long, term, relationship, with, estella, coleman, a, woman, about, 15, years, his, senior, and, the, mother, of, the, blues, musician, robert, lockwood, jr, johnson, reportedly, cultivated, a, woman, to, look, after, him, in, each, town, he, played, in, he, reputedly, asked, homely, young, women, living, in, the, country, with, their, families, whether, he, could, go, home, with, them, and, in, most, cases, he, was, accepted, until, a, boyfriend, arrived, or, johnson, was, ready, to, move, on, in, 1941, alan, lomax, learned, from, muddy, waters, that, johnson, had, performed, in, the, area, around, clarksdale, mississippi, by, 1959, the, historian, samuel, charters, could, add, only, that, will, shade, of, the, memphis, jug, band, remembered, johnson, had, once, briefly, played, with, him, in, west, memphis, arkansas, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, johnson, is, believed, to, have, traveled, to, st, louis, chicago, detroit, and, new, york, city, in, 1938, columbia, records, producer, john, h, hammond, who, owned, some, of, johnson, s, records, directed, record, producer, don, law, to, seek, out, johnson, to, book, him, for, the, first, from, spirituals, to, swing, concert, at, carnegie, hall, in, new, york, on, learning, of, johnson, s, death, hammond, replaced, him, with, big, bill, broonzy, but, he, played, two, of, johnson, s, records, from, the, stage, in, jackson, mississippi, around, 1936, johnson, sought, out, h, c, speir, who, ran, a, general, store, and, also, acted, as, a, talent, scout, speir, put, johnson, in, touch, with, ernie, oertle, who, as, a, salesman, for, the, arc, group, of, labels, introduced, johnson, to, don, law, to, record, his, first, sessions, in, san, antonio, texas, the, recording, session, was, held, on, november, 23, 25, 1936, in, room, 414, of, the, gunter, hotel, in, san, antonio, in, the, ensuing, three, day, session, johnson, played, 16, selections, and, recorded, alternate, takes, for, most, of, them, among, the, songs, johnson, recorded, in, san, antonio, were, i, believe, i, ll, dust, my, broom, sweet, home, chicago, and, cross, road, blues, which, later, became, blues, standards, the, first, to, be, released, was, terraplane, blues, backed, with, last, fair, deal, gone, down, which, sold, as, many, as, 10, 000, copies, johnson, traveled, to, dallas, texas, for, another, recording, session, with, don, law, in, a, makeshift, studio, at, the, vitagraph, warner, bros, building, on, june, 19, 20, 1937, johnson, recorded, almost, half, of, the, 29, songs, that, make, up, his, entire, discography, in, dallas, and, eleven, records, from, this, session, were, released, within, the, following, year, most, of, johnson, s, somber, and, introspective, songs, and, performances, come, from, his, second, recording, session, johnson, did, two, takes, of, most, of, these, songs, and, recordings, of, those, takes, survived, because, of, this, there, is, more, opportunity, to, compare, different, performances, of, a, single, song, by, johnson, than, for, any, other, blues, performer, of, his, era, in, contrast, to, most, delta, players, johnson, had, absorbed, the, idea, of, fitting, a, composed, song, into, the, three, minutes, of, a, 78, rpm, side, johnson, died, on, august, 16, 1938, at, the, age, of, 27, near, greenwood, mississippi, of, unknown, causes, johnson, s, death, was, not, reported, publicly, almost, 30, years, later, gayle, dean, wardlow, a, mississippi, based, musicologist, researching, johnson, s, life, found, johnson, s, death, certificate, which, listed, only, the, date, and, location, with, no, official, cause, of, death, no, formal, autopsy, had, been, done, instead, a, pro, forma, examination, was, done, to, file, the, death, certificate, and, no, immediate, cause, of, death, was, determined, it, is, likely, he, had, congenital, syphilis, and, it, was, suspected, later, by, medical, professionals, that, this, may, have, been, a, contributing, factor, in, his, death, however, 30, years, of, local, oral, tradition, had, like, the, rest, of, his, life, story, built, a, legend, which, has, filled, in, gaps, in, the, scant, historical, record, several, differing, accounts, have, described, the, events, preceding, his, death, johnson, had, been, playing, for, a, few, weeks, at, a, country, dance, in, a, town, about, 15, miles, 24, km, from, greenwood, according, to, one, theory, johnson, was, murdered, by, the, jealous, husband, of, a, woman, with, whom, he, had, flirted, in, an, account, by, the, blues, musician, sonny, boy, williamson, johnson, had, been, flirting, with, a, married, woman, at, a, dance, and, she, gave, him, a, bottle, of, whiskey, poisoned, by, her, husband, when, johnson, took, the, bottle, williamson, knocked, it, out, of, his, hand, admonishing, him, to, never, drink, from, a, bottle, that, he, had, not, personally, seen, opened, johnson, replied, don, t, ever, knock, a, bottle, out, of, my, hand, soon, after, he, was, offered, another, poisoned, bottle, and, accepted, it, johnson, is, reported, to, have, begun, feeling, ill, the, evening, after, and, had, to, be, helped, back, to, his, room, in, the, early, morning, hours, over, the, next, three, days, his, condition, steadily, worsened, witnesses, reported, that, he, died, in, a, convulsive, state, of, severe, pain, the, musicologist, robert, mack, mccormick, claimed, to, have, tracked, down, the, man, who, murdered, johnson, and, to, have, obtained, a, confession, from, him, in, a, personal, interview, but, he, declined, to, reveal, the, man, s, name, while, strychnine, has, been, suggested, as, the, poison, that, killed, johnson, at, least, one, scholar, has, disputed, the, notion, tom, graves, in, his, book, crossroads, the, life, and, afterlife, of, blues, legend, robert, johnson, relies, on, expert, testimony, from, toxicologists, to, argue, that, strychnine, has, such, a, distinctive, odor, and, taste, that, it, cannot, be, disguised, even, in, strong, liquor, graves, also, claims, that, a, significant, amount, of, strychnine, would, have, to, be, consumed, in, one, sitting, to, be, fatal, and, that, death, from, the, poison, would, occur, within, hours, not, days, in, their, 2019, book, up, jumped, the, devil, bruce, conforth, and, gayle, dean, wardlow, suggest, that, the, poison, was, naphthalene, from, dissolved, mothballs, this, was, a, common, way, of, poisoning, people, in, the, rural, south, but, was, rarely, fatal, however, johnson, had, been, diagnosed, with, an, ulcer, and, with, esophageal, varices, and, the, poison, was, sufficient, to, cause, them, to, hemorrhage, he, died, after, two, days, of, severe, abdominal, pain, vomiting, and, bleeding, from, the, mouth, the, leflore, county, registrar, cornelia, jordan, years, later, and, after, conducting, an, investigation, into, johnson, s, death, for, the, state, director, of, vital, statistics, r, n, whitfield, wrote, a, clarifying, note, on, the, back, of, johnson, s, death, certificate, i, talked, with, the, white, man, on, whose, place, this, negro, died, and, i, also, talked, with, a, negro, woman, on, the, place, the, plantation, owner, said, the, negro, man, seemingly, about, 26, years, old, came, from, tunica, two, or, three, weeks, before, he, died, to, play, banjo, at, a, negro, dance, given, there, on, the, plantation, he, stayed, in, the, house, with, some, of, the, negroes, saying, he, wanted, to, pick, cotton, the, white, man, did, not, have, a, doctor, for, this, negro, as, he, had, not, worked, for, him, he, was, buried, in, a, homemade, coffin, furnished, by, the, county, the, plantation, owner, said, it, was, his, opinion, that, the, man, died, of, syphilis, in, 2006, a, medical, practitioner, david, connell, suggested, on, the, basis, of, photographs, showing, johnson, s, unnaturally, long, fingers, and, one, bad, eye, that, johnson, may, have, had, marfan, syndrome, which, could, have, both, affected, his, guitar, playing, and, contributed, to, his, death, due, to, aortic, dissection, the, true, location, of, johnson, s, grave, is, unknown, three, different, markers, have, been, erected, at, possible, sites, in, church, cemeteries, outside, greenwood, john, hammond, jr, in, the, documentary, the, search, for, robert, johnson, 1991, suggests, that, owing, to, poverty, and, lack, of, transportation, johnson, is, most, likely, to, have, been, buried, in, a, pauper, s, grave, or, potter, s, field, very, near, where, he, died, according, to, legend, as, a, young, man, living, on, a, plantation, in, rural, mississippi, johnson, had, a, tremendous, desire, to, become, a, great, blues, musician, one, of, the, legends, often, told, says, that, johnson, was, instructed, to, take, his, guitar, to, a, crossroad, near, dockery, plantation, at, midnight, there, are, claims, for, other, sites, as, the, location, of, the, crossroads, there, he, was, met, by, a, large, black, man, the, devil, who, took, the, guitar, and, tuned, it, the, devil, played, a, few, songs, and, then, returned, the, guitar, to, johnson, giving, him, mastery, of, the, instrument, this, story, of, a, deal, with, the, devil, at, the, crossroads, mirrors, the, legend, of, faust, in, exchange, for, his, soul, johnson, was, able, to, create, the, blues, for, which, he, became, famous, this, story, was, originally, associated, with, delta, blues, musician, tommy, johnson, to, whom, robert, johnson, was, unrelated, tommy, johnson, who, grew, up, near, the, dockery, plantation, and, learned, the, blues, from, charlie, patton, and, willie, brown, first, claimed, to, have, sold, his, soul, to, the, devil, at, a, crossroads, in, exchange, for, his, mastery, of, the, guitar, this, legend, was, developed, over, time, and, has, been, chronicled, by, gayle, dean, wardlow, edward, komara, and, elijah, wald, who, sees, the, legend, as, largely, dating, from, johnson, s, rediscovery, by, white, fans, more, than, two, decades, after, his, death, son, house, once, told, the, story, to, pete, welding, as, an, explanation, of, johnson, s, astonishingly, rapid, mastery, of, the, guitar, other, interviewers, failed, to, elicit, any, confirmation, from, house, and, there, were, two, full, years, between, house, s, observation, of, johnson, as, first, a, novice, and, then, a, master, further, details, were, absorbed, from, the, imaginative, retellings, by, greil, marcus, and, robert, palmer, most, significantly, the, detail, was, added, that, johnson, received, his, gift, from, a, large, black, man, at, a, crossroads, there, is, dispute, as, to, how, and, when, the, crossroads, detail, was, attached, to, the, robert, johnson, story, all, the, published, evidence, including, a, full, chapter, on, the, subject, in, the, biography, crossroads, by, tom, graves, suggests, an, origin, in, the, story, of, the, blues, musician, tommy, johnson, this, story, was, collected, from, his, musical, associate, ishman, bracey, and, his, elder, brother, ledell, in, the, 1960s, one, version, of, ledell, johnson, s, account, was, published, in, david, evans, s, 1971, biography, of, tommy, johnson, and, was, repeated, in, print, in, 1982, alongside, house, s, story, in, the, widely, read, searching, for, robert, johnson, by, peter, guralnick, in, another, version, ledell, placed, the, meeting, not, at, a, crossroads, but, in, a, graveyard, this, resembles, the, story, told, to, steve, lavere, that, ike, zimmerman, of, hazlehurst, mississippi, learned, to, play, the, guitar, at, midnight, while, sitting, on, tombstones, zimmerman, is, believed, to, have, influenced, the, playing, of, the, young, johnson, recent, research, by, the, blues, scholar, bruce, conforth, in, living, blues, magazine, makes, the, story, clearer, johnson, and, ike, zimmerman, did, practice, in, a, graveyard, at, night, because, it, was, quiet, and, no, one, would, disturb, them, but, it, was, not, the, hazlehurst, cemetery, as, had, been, believed, zimmerman, was, not, from, hazlehurst, but, nearby, beauregard, and, he, did, not, practice, in, one, graveyard, but, in, several, in, the, area, johnson, spent, about, a, year, living, with, and, learning, from, zimmerman, who, ultimately, accompanied, johnson, back, to, the, delta, to, look, after, him, while, dockery, hazlehurst, and, beauregard, have, each, been, claimed, as, the, locations, of, the, mythical, crossroads, there, are, also, tourist, attractions, claiming, to, be, the, crossroads, in, both, clarksdale, and, memphis, residents, of, rosedale, mississippi, claim, johnson, sold, his, soul, to, the, devil, at, the, intersection, of, highways, 1, and, 8, in, their, town, while, the, 1986, movie, crossroads, was, filmed, in, beulah, mississippi, the, blues, historian, steve, cheseborough, wrote, that, it, may, be, impossible, to, discover, the, exact, location, of, the, mythical, crossroads, because, robert, johnson, was, a, rambling, guy, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, devil, in, these, songs, may, refer, not, only, to, the, christian, figure, of, satan, but, also, to, the, trickster, god, of, african, origin, legba, himself, associated, with, crossroads, folklorist, harry, m, hyatt, wrote, that, during, his, research, in, the, south, from, 1935, to, 1939, when, african, americans, born, in, the, 19th, or, early, 20th, century, said, they, or, anyone, else, had, sold, their, soul, to, the, devil, at, the, crossroads, they, had, a, different, meaning, in, mind, hyatt, claimed, there, was, evidence, indicating, african, religious, retentions, surrounding, legba, and, the, making, of, a, deal, not, selling, the, soul, in, the, same, sense, as, in, the, faustian, tradition, cited, by, graves, with, the, so, called, devil, at, the, crossroads, the, blues, and, the, blues, singer, has, really, special, powers, over, women, especially, it, is, said, that, the, blues, singer, could, possess, women, and, have, any, woman, they, wanted, and, so, when, robert, johnson, came, back, having, left, his, community, as, an, apparently, mediocre, musician, with, a, clear, genius, in, his, guitar, style, and, lyrics, people, said, he, must, have, sold, his, soul, to, the, devil, and, that, fits, in, with, this, old, african, association, with, the, crossroads, where, you, find, wisdom, you, go, down, to, the, crossroads, to, learn, and, in, his, case, to, learn, in, a, faustian, pact, with, the, devil, you, sell, your, soul, to, become, the, greatest, musician, in, history, this, view, that, the, devil, in, johnson, s, songs, is, derived, from, an, african, deity, was, disputed, by, the, blues, scholar, david, evans, in, an, essay, published, in, 1999, demythologizing, the, blues, there, are, several, serious, problems, with, this, crossroads, myth, the, devil, imagery, found, in, the, blues, is, thoroughly, familiar, from, western, folklore, and, nowhere, do, blues, singers, ever, mention, legba, or, any, other, african, deity, in, their, songs, or, other, lore, the, actual, african, music, connected, with, cults, of, legba, and, similar, trickster, deities, sounds, nothing, like, the, blues, but, rather, features, polyrhythmic, percussion, and, choral, call, and, response, singing, the, musicologist, alan, lomax, dismissed, the, myth, stating, in, fact, every, blues, fiddler, banjo, picker, harp, blower, piano, strummer, and, guitar, framer, was, in, the, opinion, of, both, himself, and, his, peers, a, child, of, the, devil, a, consequence, of, the, black, view, of, the, european, dance, embrace, as, sinful, in, the, extreme, both, lomax, s, and, evans, s, accounts, themselves, have, been, disputed, and, dismissed, by, black, scholars, and, authors, including, amiri, baraka, and, cornel, west, west, defines, blues, as, a, creation, of, a, people, who, are, willing, to, look, unflinchingly, at, catastrophic, conditions, as, children, of, god, responding, to, those, conditions, baraka, s, words, are, more, directly, critical, of, white, writers, who, study, african, american, blues, artform, and, culture, from, a, western, viewpoint, stating, that, they, have, to, do, that, to, make, themselves, superior, in, some, kind, of, way, that, everything, has, come, from, europe, which, is, not, true, baraka, cites, that, rather, than, being, formed, out, of, any, western, context, blues, derives, from, an, african, context, of, its, own, the, call, and, response, singing, lomax, argues, is, different, from, blues, has, been, widely, cited, as, being, a, central, aspect, of, blues, music, johnson, is, considered, a, master, of, the, blues, particularly, of, the, delta, blues, style, keith, richards, of, the, rolling, stones, said, in, 1990, you, want, to, know, how, good, the, blues, can, get, well, this, is, it, but, according, to, elijah, wald, in, his, book, escaping, the, delta, johnson, in, his, own, time, was, most, respected, for, his, ability, to, play, in, a, wide, range, of, styles, from, raw, country, slide, guitar, to, jazz, and, pop, licks, and, for, his, ability, to, pick, up, guitar, parts, almost, instantly, upon, hearing, a, song, his, first, recorded, song, kind, hearted, woman, blues, in, contrast, to, the, prevailing, delta, style, of, the, time, more, resembled, the, style, of, chicago, or, st, louis, with, a, full, fledged, abundantly, varied, musical, arrangement, the, song, was, part, of, a, cycle, of, spin, offs, and, response, songs, that, began, with, leroy, carr, s, mean, mistreater, mama, 1934, according, to, wald, it, was, the, most, musically, complex, in, the, cycle, and, stood, apart, from, most, rural, blues, as, a, thoroughly, composed, lyric, rather, than, an, arbitrary, collection, of, more, or, less, unrelated, verses, unusual, for, a, delta, player, of, the, time, a, recording, exhibits, what, johnson, could, do, entirely, outside, of, a, blues, style, they, re, red, hot, from, his, first, recording, session, shows, that, he, was, also, comfortable, with, an, uptown, swing, or, ragtime, sound, similar, to, that, of, the, harlem, hamfats, but, as, wald, remarked, no, record, company, was, heading, to, mississippi, in, search, of, a, down, home, ink, spots, e, could, undoubtedly, have, come, up, with, a, lot, more, songs, in, this, style, if, the, producers, had, wanted, them, to, the, uninitiated, johnson, s, recordings, may, sound, like, just, another, dusty, delta, blues, musician, wailing, away, but, a, careful, listen, reveals, that, johnson, was, a, revisionist, in, his, time, johnson, s, tortured, soul, vocals, and, anxiety, ridden, guitar, playing, aren, t, found, in, the, cotton, field, blues, of, his, contemporaries, marc, myers, an, important, aspect, of, johnson, s, singing, was, his, use, of, microtonality, these, subtle, inflections, of, pitch, help, explain, why, his, singing, conveys, such, powerful, emotion, eric, clapton, described, johnson, s, music, as, the, most, powerful, cry, that, i, think, you, can, find, in, the, human, voice, in, two, takes, of, me, and, the, devil, blues, he, shows, a, high, degree, of, precision, in, the, complex, vocal, delivery, of, the, last, verse, the, range, of, tone, he, can, pack, into, a, few, lines, is, astonishing, the, song, s, hip, humor, and, sophistication, is, often, overlooked, enerations, of, blues, writers, in, search, of, wild, delta, primitivism, wrote, wald, have, been, inclined, to, overlook, or, undervalue, aspects, that, show, johnson, as, a, polished, professional, performer, johnson, is, also, known, for, using, the, guitar, as, the, other, vocalist, in, the, song, a, technique, later, perfected, by, b, b, king, and, his, personified, guitar, named, lucille, in, africa, and, in, afro, american, tradition, there, is, the, tradition, of, the, talking, instrument, beginning, with, the, drums, the, one, strand, and, then, the, six, strings, with, bottleneck, style, performance, it, becomes, a, competing, voice, or, a, complementary, voice, in, the, performance, when, johnson, started, singing, he, seemed, like, a, guy, who, could, have, sprung, from, the, head, of, zeus, in, full, armor, i, immediately, differentiated, between, him, and, anyone, else, i, had, ever, heard, the, songs, weren, t, customary, blues, songs, they, were, so, utterly, fluid, at, first, they, went, by, quick, too, quick, to, even, get, they, jumped, all, over, the, place, in, range, and, subject, matter, short, punchy, verses, that, resulted, in, some, panoramic, story, fires, of, mankind, blasting, off, the, surface, of, this, spinning, piece, of, plastic, bob, dylan, johnson, mastered, the, guitar, being, considered, today, one, of, the, all, time, greats, on, the, instrument, his, approach, was, complex, and, musically, advanced, when, keith, richards, was, first, introduced, to, johnson, s, music, by, his, bandmate, brian, jones, he, asked, who, is, the, other, guy, playing, with, him, not, realizing, it, was, johnson, playing, one, guitar, i, was, hearing, two, guitars, and, it, took, a, long, time, to, actually, realise, he, was, doing, it, all, by, himself, said, richards, who, later, stated, that, robert, johnson, was, like, an, orchestra, all, by, himself, as, for, his, guitar, technique, it, s, politely, reedy, but, ambitiously, eclectic, moving, effortlessly, from, hen, picking, and, bottleneck, slides, to, a, full, deck, of, chucka, chucka, rhythm, figures, in, the, story, with, dick, gordon, bill, ferris, of, american, public, media, said, robert, johnson, i, think, of, in, the, same, way, i, think, of, the, british, romantic, poets, keats, and, shelley, who, burned, out, early, who, were, geniuses, at, wordsmithing, poetry, the, blues, if, anything, are, deeply, sexual, you, know, my, car, doesn, t, run, i, m, gonna, check, my, oil, if, you, don, t, like, my, apples, don, t, shake, my, tree, every, verse, has, sexuality, associated, with, it, johnson, fused, approaches, specific, to, delta, blues, to, those, from, the, broader, music, world, the, slide, guitar, work, on, ramblin, on, my, mind, is, pure, delta, and, johnson, s, vocal, there, has, a, touch, of, son, house, rawness, but, the, train, imitation, on, the, bridge, is, not, at, all, typical, of, delta, blues, it, is, more, like, something, out, of, minstrel, show, music, or, vaudeville, johnson, did, record, versions, of, preaching, the, blues, and, walking, blues, in, the, older, bluesman, s, vocal, and, guitar, style, house, s, chronology, has, been, questioned, by, guralnick, as, with, the, first, take, of, come, on, in, my, kitchen, the, influence, of, skip, james, is, evident, in, james, s, devil, got, my, woman, but, the, lyrics, rise, to, the, level, of, first, rate, poetry, and, johnson, sings, with, a, strained, voice, found, nowhere, else, in, his, recorded, output, the, sad, romantic, love, in, vain, successfully, blends, several, of, johnson, s, disparate, influences, the, form, including, the, wordless, last, verse, follows, leroy, carr, s, last, hit, when, the, sun, goes, down, the, words, of, the, last, sung, verse, come, directly, from, a, song, blind, lemon, jefferson, recorded, in, 1926, johnson, s, last, recording, milkcow, s, calf, blues, is, his, most, direct, tribute, to, kokomo, arnold, who, wrote, milkcow, blues, and, influenced, johnson, s, vocal, style, from, four, until, late, shows, johnson, s, mastery, of, a, blues, style, not, usually, associated, with, the, delta, he, croons, the, lyrics, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, lonnie, johnson, and, his, guitar, style, is, more, that, of, a, ragtime, influenced, player, like, blind, blake, lonnie, johnson, s, influence, is, even, clearer, in, two, other, departures, from, the, usual, delta, style, malted, milk, and, drunken, hearted, man, both, copy, the, arrangement, of, lonnie, johnson, s, life, saver, blues, the, two, takes, of, me, and, the, devil, blues, show, the, influence, of, peetie, wheatstraw, calling, into, question, the, interpretation, of, this, piece, as, the, spontaneous, heart, cry, of, a, demon, driven, folk, artist, famed, producer, john, hammond, was, an, early, advocate, of, johnson, s, music, using, the, pen, name, henry, johnson, he, wrote, his, first, article, on, robert, johnson, for, the, new, masses, magazine, in, march, 1937, around, the, time, of, the, release, of, johnson, s, first, record, in, it, he, described, johnson, as, the, greatest, negro, blues, singer, who, has, cropped, up, in, recent, years, johnson, makes, leadbelly, sound, like, an, accomplished, poseur, the, following, year, hammond, hoped, to, get, johnson, to, perform, at, a, december, 1938, from, spirituals, to, swing, concert, in, new, york, city, as, he, was, unaware, that, johnson, had, died, in, august, instead, hammond, played, two, of, his, recordings, walkin, blues, and, preachin, blues, up, jumped, the, devil, for, the, audience, and, praised, johnson, lavishly, from, the, stage, music, historian, ted, gioia, noted, here, if, only, through, the, medium, of, recordings, hammond, used, his, considerable, influence, at, this, historic, event, to, advocate, a, position, of, preeminence, for, the, late, delta, bluesman, music, educator, james, perone, also, saw, that, the, event, underscored, robert, johnson, s, specific, importance, as, a, recording, artist, in, 1939, columbia, issued, a, final, single, pairing, preachin, blues, with, love, in, vain, in, 1940, nine, of, johnson, s, songs, were, included, on, a, list, of, american, folk, songs, on, commercial, records, prepared, by, musicologist, alan, lomax, for, a, u, s, government, conference, lomax, s, notations, for, the, entries, range, from, elaborate, sex, symbolism, terraplane, blues, very, nice, love, song, i, m, a, steady, rollin, man, to, traces, of, voodoo, stones, in, my, passway,

edward, smith, the, authors, described, johnson, s, vocals, as, imaginative, and, thrilling, and, his, guitar, playing, as, exciting, as, almost, anything, in, the, folk, blues, field, music, writer, rudi, blesh, included, a, review, of, johnson, s, hellhound, on, my, trail, in, his, 1946, book, shining, trumpets, a, history, of, jazz, he, noted, the, personal, and, creative, way, johnson, approached, the, song, s, harmony, jim, wilson, then, a, writer, for, the, detroit, free, press, also, mentioned, his, unconventional, use, of, harmony, in, a, 1949, review, he, compared, elements, of, john, lee, hooker, s, recent, debut, boogie, chillen, his, dynamic, rhythms, and, subtle, nuances, on, the, guitar, and, his, startling, disregard, for, familiar, scale, and, harmony, patterns, show, similarity, to, the, work, of, robert, johnson, who, made, many, fine, records, in, this, vein, samuel, charters, drew, further, attention, to, johnson, in, a, five, page, section, in, his, 1959, book, the, country, blues, he, focused, on, the, two, johnson, recordings, that, referred, to, images, of, the, devil, or, hell, hellhound, on, my, trail, and, me, and, the, devil, blues, to, suggest, that, johnson, was, a, deeply, troubled, individual, charters, also, included, johnson, s, preachin, blues, on, the, album, published, alongside, his, book, columbia, records, first, album, of, johnson, s, recordings, king, of, the, delta, blues, singers, was, issued, two, years, later, johnson, is, mentioned, as, one, of, the, delta, artists, who, was, a, strong, influence, on, blues, singers, in, post, war, styles, however, it, is, johnson, s, guitar, technique, that, is, often, identified, as, his, greatest, contribution, blues, historian, edward, komara, wrote, the, execution, of, a, driving, bass, beat, on, a, plectrum, instrument, like, the, guitar, instead, of, the, piano, is, johnson, s, most, influential, accomplishment, this, is, the, aspect, of, his, music, that, most, changed, the, delta, blues, practice, and, is, most, retained, in, the, blues, guitar, tradition, this, technique, has, been, called, a, boogie, bass, pattern, or, boogie, shuffle, and, is, described, as, a, fifth, sixth, oscillation, above, the, root, chord, sometimes, it, has, been, attributed, to, johnnie, temple, because, he, was, the, first, to, record, a, song, in, 1935, using, it, however, temple, confirmed, that, he, had, learned, the, technique, from, johnson, he, was, the, first, one, i, ever, heard, use, it, it, was, similar, to, a, piano, boogie, bass, i, learned, from, r, l, in, 32, or, 33, johnny, shines, added, some, of, the, things, that, robert, did, with, the, guitar, affected, the, way, everybody, played, in, the, early, thirties, boogie, was, rare, on, the, guitar, something, to, be, heard, conforth, and, wardlow, call, it, one, of, the, most, important, riffs, in, blues, music, and, music, historian, peter, guralnick, believes, johnson, popularized, a, mode, which, would, rapidly, become, the, accepted, pattern, although, author, elijah, wald, recognizes, johnson, s, contribution, in, popularizing, the, innovation, he, discounts, its, importance, and, adds, as, far, as, the, evolution, of, black, music, goes, robert, johnson, was, an, extremely, minor, figure, and, very, little, that, happened, in, the, decades, following, his, death, would, have, been, affected, if, he, had, never, played, a, note, johnson, s, contemporaries, including, johnny, shines, johnnie, temple, henry, townsend, robert, lockwood, jr, calvin, frazier, and, david, honeyboy, edwards, were, among, those, who, kept, his, music, alive, through, performing, his, songs, and, using, his, guitar, techniques, fellow, mississippi, native, elmore, james, is, the, best, known, and, is, responsible, for, popularizing, johnson, s, dust, my, broom, in, 1951, he, recast, the, song, as, a, chicago, style, blues, with, electric, slide, guitar, and, a, backing, band, according, to, blues, historian, gerard, herhaft, johnson, s, influence, upon, elmore, james, s, music, always, remained, powerful, his, falsetto, voice, almost, shrill, and, the, intensive, use, of, the, walking, bass, notes, of, the, boogie, woogie, several, pieces, of, james, repertoire, were, borrowed, from, johnson, e, g, dust, my, broom, rambling, on, my, mind, and, crossroads, james, version, is, identified, as, one, of, the, first, recorded, examples, of, what, was, to, become, the, classic, chicago, shuffle, beat, the, style, often, associated, with, chicago, blues, was, used, extensively, by, jimmy, reed, beginning, with, his, first, record, high, and, lonesome, in, 1953, sometimes, called, the, trademark, reed, shuffle, although, also, associated, his, second, guitarist, eddie, taylor, it, is, the, figure, johnson, used, updated, for, electric, guitar, several, of, johnson, s, songs, became, blues, standards, which, is, used, to, describe, blues, songs, that, have, been, widely, performed, and, recorded, over, a, period, of, time, and, are, seen, as, having, a, lasting, quality, perone, notes, that, such, a, relatively, high, percentage, of, the, songs, attributed, to, him, became, blues, standards, also, keeps, the, legacy, of, robert, johnson, alive, those, most, often, identified, are, sweet, home, chicago, and, dust, my, broom, but, also, include, crossroads, and, stop, breaking, down, as, with, many, blues, songs, there, are, melodic, and, lyrical, precedents, while, sweet, home, chicago, borrows, from, kokomo, arnold, s, 1933, old, original, kokomo, blues, johnson, s, lyrics, made, the, song, a, natural, for, chicago, bluesmen, and, it, s, his, version, that, survived, in, the, repertoires, of, performers, like, magic, sam, robert, lockwood, and, junior, parker, in, the, first, decades, after, johnsons, death, these, songs, with, some, variations, in, the, titles, and, lyrics, were, recorded, by, tommy, mcclennan, 1939, walter, davis, 1941, sonny, boy, williamson, i, 1945, arthur, crudup, 1949, texas, alexander, 1950, elmore, james, 1951, 1959, baby, boy, warren, 1954, roosevelt, sykes, 1955, junior, parker, 1958, and, forest, city, joe, 1959, pearson, and, mcculloch, believe, that, sweet, home, chicago, and, dust, my, broom, in, particular, connect, johnson, to, the, rightful, inheritors, of, his, musical, ideas, big, city, african, american, artists, whose, high, powered, electrically, amplified, blues, remain, solidly, in, touch, with, johnson, s, musical, legacy, at, the, time, of, columbia, s, first, release, of, a, full, album, of, his, songs, in, 1961, in, jim, o, neal, s, statement, when, johnson, was, inducted, into, the, blues, foundation, blues, hall, of, fame, he, identified, hell, hound, on, my, trail, sweet, home, chicago, dust, my, broom, love, in, vain, and, crossroads, as, johnson, s, classic, recordings, over, the, years, these, songs, have, been, individually, inducted, into, the, blues, hall, s, classic, of, blues, recording, single, or, album, track, category, as, well, as, come, on, in, my, kitchen, and, terraplane, blues, in, the, mid, 1950s, rock, and, roll, pioneer, chuck, berry, adapted, the, boogie, pattern, on, guitar, for, his, songs, roll, over, beethoven, and, johnny, b, goode, author, dave, rubin, commented, his, utilization, of, the, bass, string, cut, boogie, patterns, popularized, by, robert, johnson, on, songs, like, sweet, home, chicago, subtly, altered, the, swing, feel, of, the, boogie, blues, into, a, more, driving, straight, 4, 4, meter, while, still, maintaining, a, limber, lilt, that, is, often, missing, in, the, countless, imitations, that, followed, the, pattern, became, one, of, the, signature, figures, in, early, electric, guitar, based, rock, and, roll, such, as, that, of, chuck, berry, and, the, numerous, rock, musicians, of, the, 1960s, who, were, influenced, by, berry, according, to, perone, although, music, historian, larry, birnbaum, also, sees, the, connection, he, wrote, that, johnson, s, contributions, to, the, origins, of, rock, n, roll, are, negligible, the, rock, and, roll, hall, of, fame, inducted, johnson, as, an, early, influence, in, its, first, induction, ceremony, in, 1986, almost, a, half, century, after, his, death, it, also, included, four, of, his, songs, it, deemed, to, have, shaped, the, genre, sweet, home, chicago, cross, road, blues, hellhound, on, my, trail, and, love, in, vain, marc, meyers, of, the, wall, street, journal, commented, his, stop, breakin, down, blues, from, 1937, is, so, far, ahead, of, its, time, that, the, song, could, easily, have, been, a, rock, demo, cut, in, 1954, several, rock, artists, describe, johnson, as, an, influence, the, thing, about, robert, johnson, was, that, he, only, existed, on, his, records, he, was, pure, legend, martin, scorsese, love, in, vain, a, vision, of, robert, johnson, until, the, 2019, publication, of,

johnson, have, been, located, in, county, records, offices, the, ages, given, in, these, certificates, point, to, different, birth, dates, but, conforth, and, wardlow, suggest, that, johnson, lied, about, his, age, in, order, to, obtain, a, marriage, license, carrie, thompson, claimed, that, her, mother, who, was, also, robert, s, mother, remembered, his, birth, date, as, may, 8, 1911, he, was, not, listed, among, his, mother, s, children, in, the, 1910, census, giving, further, credence, to, a, 1911, birthdate, although, the, 1920, census, gives, his, age, as, 7, suggesting, he, was, born,

their, first, release, and, efforts, were, made, to, discover, his, biography, with, virtually, no, success, a, relatively, full, account, of, johnson, s, brief, musical, career, emerged, in, the, 1960s, largely, from, accounts, by, son, house, johnny, shines, david, honeyboy, edwards, and, robert, lockwood, in, 1961, the, sleeve, notes, to, the, album, king, of, the, delta, blues, singers,

or, conflict, with, other, accounts, until, the, 1980s, it, was, believed, that, no, images, of, johnson, had, survived, however, three, images, of, johnson, were, located, in, 1972, and, 1973, in, the, possession, of, his, half, sister, carrie, thompson, two, of, these, known, as, the, dime, store, photo, december, 1937, or, january, 1938, and, the, studio, portrait, summer, 1936, were,

studio, portrait, in, a, 1989, article, by, stephen, calt, and, gayle, dean, wardlow, in, 78, quarterly, both, were, subsequently, featured, prominently, in, the, printed, materials, associated, with, the, 1990, cbs, box, set, of, the, complete, johnson, recordings, as, well, as, being, widely, republished, since, that, time, because, mississippi, courts, in, 1998, determined, that, robert, johnson, s, heir, was, claud, johnson, a, son, born, out, of, wedlock, the, estate, share, of, all, monies, paid, to, lavere, by, cbs, and, others, ended, up, going, to, claud, johnson, and, attempts,

pinstripe, suit, photograph, showing, louis, dressed, in, his, united, states, navy, uniform, this, picture, along, with, the, studio, portrait, were, both, lent, by, carrie, thompson, to, mccormick, in, 1972, mccormick, never, returned, the, photograph, of, johnson, in, his, uniform, keeping, it, in, his, archive, until, his, death, mccormick, s, daughter, donated, the, archive, to, the,

the, museum, had, agreed, to, return, the, photograph, and, was, awaiting, instructions, from, the, johnson, family, this, photograph, has, never, been, made, public, another, photograph, purporting, to, show, johnson, posing, with, the, blues, musician, johnny, shines, was, published, in, the, november, 2008, issue, of, vanity, fair, magazine, its, authenticity, was, claimed, by, the, forensic, artist, lois, gibson, and, by, johnson, s, estate, in, 2013, but, has, been, disputed, by, some, music, historians, including, elijah, wald, bruce, conforth, and, gayle, dean, wardlow, who, considered, that, the, clothing, suggests, a, date, after, johnson, s, death, and, that, the, photograph, may, have, been, reversed, and, retouched, further, both, david, honeyboy, edwards, and, robert, lockwood, failed, to, identify, either, man, in, the, photo, facial, recognition, software, concluded, that, neither, man, was, johnson, or, shines, finally, gibson, claimed, the, photo, was, from, 1933, to, 1934, but, it, is, known, that, johnson, did, not, meet, shines, until, early, 1937, in, december, 2015, a, fourth, photograph, was, published, purportedly, showing, johnson, his, wife, calletta, craft, estella, coleman, and, robert, lockwood, jr, this, photograph, was, also, declared, authentic, by, lois, gibson, but, her, identification, of, johnson, has, been, dismissed, by, other, facial, recognition, experts, and, blues, historians, there, are, a, number, of, reasons, why, the, photograph, is, unlikely, to, be, johnson, it, has, been, proven, that, craft, died, before, johnson, met, coleman, the, clothing, could, not, be, prior, to, the, late, 1940s, the, furniture, is, from, the, 1950s, the, coca, cola, bottle, cannot, be, from, prior, to, 1950, etc, a, third,
