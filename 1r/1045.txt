system, of, oral, law, and, blood, feud, by, the, draconian, constitution, a, written, code, to, be, enforced, only, by, a, court, of, law, draco, s, name, may, be, a, metaphor, lit, sharp, sighted, not, the, name, of, an, actual, person, since, there, are, reasons, to, believe, that, draco, is, also, a, fiction, entirely, or, in, part, this, is, supported, by, the, lack, of, a, patronymic, and, any, biographical, information, since, the, 19th, century, the, adjective, draconian, greek, drak, nteios, refers, to, similarly, unforgiving, rules, or, laws, in, greek, english, and, other, european, languages, during, the, 39th, olympiad, in, 622, or, 621, bc, draco, established, the, legal, code, with, which, he, is, identified, little, is, known, about, draco, s, life, he, may, have, belonged, to, the, greek, nobility, of, attica, prior, to, the, period, of, the, seven, sages, of, greece, according, to, the, 10th, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, the, suda, the, suda, chronicles, a, folkloric, story, of, his, death, in, the, aeginetan, theatre, in, a, traditional, ancient, greek, show, of, approval, his, supporters, threw, so, many, hats, and, shirts, and, cloaks, on, his, head, that, he, suffocated, and, was, buried, in, that, same, theatre, the, truth, about, his, death, is, still, unclear, but, it, is, known, that, draco, was, driven, out, of, athens, by, the, athenians, to, the, neighbouring, island, of, aegina, where, he, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, the, laws, thesmoi, that, he, laid, were, the, first, written, constitution, of, athens, so, that, no, one, would, be, unaware, of, them, they, were, posted, on, wooden, tablets, axones, where, they, were, preserved, for, almost, two, centuries, on, steles, of, the, shape, of, four, sided, pyramids, kyrbeis, the, tablets, were, called, axones, perhaps, because, they, could, be, pivoted, along, the, pyramid, s, axis, to, read, any, side, the, constitution, featured, several, major, innovations, the, laws, were, particularly, harsh, for, example, any, debtor, whose, status, was, lower, than, that, of, his, creditor, was, forced, into, slavery, the, punishment, was, more, lenient, for, those, owing, a, debt, to, a, member, of, a, lower, class, the, death, penalty, was, the, punishment, for, even, minor, offences, such, as, stealing, a, cabbage, concerning, the, liberal, use, of, the, death, penalty, in, the, draconic, code, plutarch, states, it, is, said, that, drakon, himself, when, asked, why, he, had, fixed, the, punishment, of, death, for, most, offences, answered, that, he, considered, these, lesser, crimes, to, deserve, it, and, he, had, no, greater, punishment, for, more, important, ones, all, draco, s, laws, were, repealed, by, solon, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, with, the, exception, of, the, homicide, law, after, much, debate, the, athenians, decided, to, revise, the, laws, including, the, homicide, law, in, 409, bc, the, homicide, law, is, a, highly, fragmented, inscription, but, states, that, it, is, up, to, the, victim, s, relatives, to, prosecute, a, killer, according, to, the, preserved, part, of, the, inscription, unintentional, homicides, received, a, sentence, of, exile, it, is, not, clear, whether, draco, s, law, specified, the, punishment, for, intentional, homicide, in, 409, bc, intentional, homicide, was, punished, by, death, but, draco, s, law, begins, although, ambiguous, and, difficult, to, translate, one, suggested, translation, is, even, if, a, man, not, intentionally, kills, another, he, is, exiled, draco, introduced, the, lot, chosen, council, of, four, hundred, distinct, from, the, areopagus, which, evolved, in, later, constitutions, to, play, a, large, role, in, athenian, democracy, aristotle, notes, that, draco, while, having, the, laws, written, merely, legislated, for, an, existing, unwritten, athenian, constitution, such, as, setting, exact, qualifications, for, eligibility, for, office, according, to, aristotle, draco, extended, the, franchise, to, all, free, men, who, could, furnish, themselves, with, a, set, of, military, equipment, however, this, claim, is, not, based, on, the, authentic, tradition, thus, untrue, as, claimed, by, welwei, in, 1998, they, elected, the, council, of, four, hundred, from, among, their, number, nine, archons, and, the, treasurers, were, drawn, from, persons, possessing, an, unencumbered, property, of, not, less, than, ten, minas, the, generals, strategoi, and, commanders, of, cavalry, hipparchoi, from, those, who, could, show, an, unencumbered, property, of, not, less, than, a, hundred, minas, and, had, children, born, in, lawful, wedlock, over, ten, years, of, age, thus, in, the, event, of, their, death, their, estate, could, pass, to, a, competent, heir, these, officers, were, required, to, hold, to, account, the, prytanes, councillors, strategoi, generals, and, hipparchoi, cavalry, officers, of, the, preceding, year, until, their, accounts, had, been, audited, the, council, of, areopagus, was, guardian, of, the, laws, and, kept, watch, over, the, magistrates, to, see, that, they, executed, their, offices, in, accordance, with, the, laws, any, person, who, felt, himself, wronged, might, lay, an, information, before, the, council, of, areopagus, on, declaring, what, law, was, broken, by, the, wrong, done, to, him, but, as, has, been, said, before, loans, were, secured, upon, the, persons, of, the, debtors, and, the, land, was, in, the, hands, of, a, few
