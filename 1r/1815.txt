georg, friedrich, bernhard, riemann, german, 17, september, 1826, 20, july, 1866, was, a, german, mathematician, who, made, profound, contributions, to, analysis, number, theory, and, differential, geometry, in, the, field, of, real, analysis, he, is, mostly, known, for, the, first, rigorous, formulation, of, the, integral, the, riemann, integral, and, his, work, on, fourier, series, his, contributions, to, complex, analysis, include, most, notably, the, introduction, of, riemann, surfaces, breaking, new, ground, in, a, natural, geometric, treatment, of, complex, analysis, his, 1859, paper, on, the, prime, counting, function, containing, the, original, statement, of, the, riemann, hypothesis, is, regarded, as, a, foundational, paper, of, analytic, number, theory, through, his, pioneering, contributions, to, differential, geometry, riemann, laid, the, foundations, of, the, mathematics, of, general, relativity, he, is, considered, by, many, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, all, time, riemann, was, born, on, 17, september, 1826, in, breselenz, a, village, near, dannenberg, in, the, kingdom, of, hanover, his, father, friedrich, bernhard, riemann, was, a, poor, lutheran, pastor, in, breselenz, who, fought, in, the, napoleonic, wars, his, mother, charlotte, ebell, died, in, 1846, riemann, was, the, second, of, six, children, shy, and, suffering, from, numerous, nervous, breakdowns, riemann, exhibited, exceptional, mathematical, talent, such, as, calculation, abilities, from, an, early, age, but, suffered, from, timidity, and, a, fear, of, speaking, in, public, during, 1840, riemann, went, to, hanover, to, live, with, his, grandmother, and, attend, lyceum, middle, school, years, because, such, a, type, of, school, was, not, accessible, from, his, home, village, after, the, death, of, his, grandmother, in, 1842, he, transferred, to, the, johanneum, l, neburg, a, high, school, in, l, neburg, there, riemann, studied, the, bible, intensively, but, he, was, often, distracted, by, mathematics, his, teachers, were, amazed, by, his, ability, to, perform, complicated, mathematical, operations, in, which, he, often, outstripped, his, instructor, s, knowledge, in, 1846, at, the, age, of, 19, he, started, studying, philology, and, christian, theology, in, order, to, become, a, pastor, and, help, with, his, family, s, finances, during, the, spring, of, 1846, his, father, after, gathering, enough, money, sent, riemann, to, the, university, of, g, ttingen, where, he, planned, to, study, towards, a, degree, in, theology, however, once, there, he, began, studying, mathematics, under, carl, friedrich, gauss, specifically, his, lectures, on, the, method, of, least, squares, gauss, recommended, that, riemann, give, up, his, theological, work, and, enter, the, mathematical, field, after, getting, his, father, s, approval, riemann, transferred, to, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1847, during, his, time, of, study, carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, jakob, steiner, and, gotthold, eisenstein, were, teaching, he, stayed, in, berlin, for, two, years, and, returned, to, g, ttingen, in, 1849, riemann, held, his, first, lectures, in, 1854, which, founded, the, field, of, riemannian, geometry, and, thereby, set, the, stage, for, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, in, 1857, there, was, an, attempt, to, promote, riemann, to, extraordinary, professor, status, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, although, this, attempt, failed, it, did, result, in, riemann, finally, being, granted, a, regular, salary, in, 1859, following, the, death, of, dirichlet, who, held, gauss, s, chair, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, he, was, promoted, to, head, the, mathematics, department, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, he, was, also, the, first, to, suggest, using, dimensions, higher, than, merely, three, or, four, in, order, to, describe, physical, reality, in, 1862, he, married, elise, koch, their, daughter, ida, schilling, was, born, on, 22, december, 1862, riemann, fled, g, ttingen, when, the, armies, of, hanover, and, prussia, clashed, there, in, 1866, he, died, of, tuberculosis, during, his, third, journey, to, italy, in, selasca, now, a, hamlet, of, verbania, on, lake, maggiore, where, he, was, buried, in, the, cemetery, in, biganzolo, verbania, riemann, was, a, dedicated, christian, the, son, of, a, protestant, minister, and, saw, his, life, as, a, mathematician, as, another, way, to, serve, god, during, his, life, he, held, closely, to, his, christian, faith, and, considered, it, to, be, the, most, important, aspect, of, his, life, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, reciting, the, lord, s, prayer, with, his, wife, and, died, before, they, finished, saying, the, prayer, meanwhile, in, g, ttingen, his, housekeeper, discarded, some, of, the, papers, in, his, office, including, much, unpublished, work, riemann, refused, to, publish, incomplete, work, and, some, deep, insights, may, have, been, lost, riemann, s, tombstone, in, biganzolo, italy, refers, to, romans, 8, 28, georg, friedrich, bernhard, riemann, professor, in, g, ttingen, born, in, breselenz, 17, september, 1826, died, in, selasca, 20, july, 1866, riemann, s, published, works, opened, up, research, areas, combining, analysis, with, geometry, these, would, subsequently, become, major, parts, of, the, theories, of, riemannian, geometry, algebraic, geometry, and, complex, manifold, theory, the, theory, of, riemann, surfaces, was, elaborated, by, felix, klein, and, particularly, adolf, hurwitz, this, area, of, mathematics, is, part, of, the, foundation, of, topology, and, is, still, being, applied, in, novel, ways, to, mathematical, physics, in, 1853, gauss, asked, riemann, his, student, to, prepare, a, habilitationsschrift, on, the, foundations, of, geometry, over, many, months, riemann, developed, his, theory, of, higher, dimensions, and, delivered, his, lecture, at, g, ttingen, on, 10, june, 1854, entitled, ueber, die, hypothesen, welche, der, geometrie, zu, grunde, liegen, it, was, not, published, until, twelve, years, later, in, 1868, by, dedekind, two, years, after, his, death, its, early, reception, appears, to, have, been, slow, but, it, is, now, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, geometry, the, subject, founded, by, this, work, is, riemannian, geometry, riemann, found, the, correct, way, to, extend, into, n, dimensions, the, differential, geometry, of, surfaces, which, gauss, himself, proved, in, his, theorema, egregium, the, fundamental, objects, are, called, the, riemannian, metric, and, the, riemann, curvature, tensor, for, the, surface, two, dimensional, case, the, curvature, at, each, point, can, be, reduced, to, a, number, scalar, with, the, surfaces, of, constant, positive, or, negative, curvature, being, models, of, the, non, euclidean, geometries, the, riemann, metric, is, a, collection, of, numbers, at, every, point, in, space, i, e, a, tensor, which, allows, measurements, of, speed, in, any, trajectory, whose, integral, gives, the, distance, between, the, trajectory, s, endpoints, for, example, riemann, found, that, in, four, spatial, dimensions, one, needs, ten, numbers, at, each, point, to, describe, distances, and, curvatures, on, a, manifold, no, matter, how, distorted, it, is, in, his, dissertation, he, established, a, geometric, foundation, for, complex, analysis, through, riemann, surfaces, through, which, multi, valued, functions, like, the, logarithm, with, infinitely, many, sheets, or, the, square, root, with, two, sheets, could, become, one, to, one, functions, complex, functions, are, harmonic, functions, that, is, they, satisfy, laplace, s, equation, and, thus, the, cauchy, riemann, equations, on, these, surfaces, and, are, described, by, the, location, of, their, singularities, and, the, topology, of, the, surfaces, the, topological, genus, of, the, riemann, surfaces, is, given, by, g, w, 2, n, 1, displaystyle, g, w, 2, n, 1, where, the, surface, has, n, displaystyle, n, leaves, coming, together, at, w, displaystyle, w, branch, points, for, g, 1, displaystyle, g, 1, the, riemann, surface, has, 3, g, 3, displaystyle, 3g, 3, parameters, the, moduli, his, contributions, to, this, area, are, numerous, the, famous, riemann, mapping, theorem, says, that, a, simply, connected, domain, in, the, complex, plane, is, biholomorphically, equivalent, i, e, there, is, a, bijection, between, them, that, is, holomorphic, with, a, holomorphic, inverse, to, either, c, displaystyle, mathbb, c, or, to, the, interior, of, the, unit, circle, the, generalization, of, the, theorem, to, riemann, surfaces, is, the, famous, uniformization, theorem, which, was, proved, in, the, 19th, century, by, henri, poincar, and, felix, klein, here, too, rigorous, proofs, were, first, given, after, the, development, of, richer, mathematical, tools, in, this, case, topology, for, the, proof, of, the, existence, of, functions, on, riemann, surfaces, he, used, a, minimality, condition, which, he, called, the, dirichlet, principle, karl, weierstrass, found, a, gap, in, the, proof, riemann, had, not, noticed, that, his, working, assumption, that, the, minimum, existed, might, not, work, the, function, space, might, not, be, complete, and, therefore, the, existence, of, a, minimum, was, not, guaranteed, through, the, work, of, david, hilbert, in, the, calculus, of, variations, the, dirichlet, principle, was, finally, established, otherwise, weierstrass, was, very, impressed, with, riemann, especially, with, his, theory, of, abelian, functions, when, riemann, s, work, appeared, weierstrass, withdrew, his, paper, from, crelle, s, journal, and, did, not, publish, it, they, had, a, good, understanding, when, riemann, visited, him, in, berlin, in, 1859, weierstrass, encouraged, his, student, hermann, amandus, schwarz, to, find, alternatives, to, the, dirichlet, principle, in, complex, analysis, in, which, he, was, successful, an, anecdote, from, arnold, sommerfeld, shows, the, difficulties, which, contemporary, mathematicians, had, with, riemann, s, new, ideas, in, 1870, weierstrass, had, taken, riemann, s, dissertation, with, him, on, a, holiday, to, rigi, and, complained, that, it, was, hard, to, understand, the, physicist, hermann, von, helmholtz, assisted, him, in, the, work, overnight, and, returned, with, the, comment, that, it, was, natural, and, very, understandable, other, highlights, include, his, work, on, abelian, functions, and, theta, functions, on, riemann, surfaces, riemann, had, been, in, a, competition, with, weierstrass, since, 1857, to, solve, the, jacobian, inverse, problems, for, abelian, integrals, a, generalization, of, elliptic, integrals, riemann, used, theta, functions, in, several, variables, and, reduced, the, problem, to, the, determination, of, the, zeros, of, these, theta, functions, riemann, also, investigated, period, matrices, and, characterized, them, through, the, riemannian, period, relations, symmetric, real, part, negative, by, ferdinand, georg, frobenius, and, solomon, lefschetz, the, validity, of, this, relation, is, equivalent, with, the, embedding, of, c, n, displaystyle, mathbb, c, n, omega, where, displaystyle, omega, is, the, lattice, of, the, period, matrix, in, a, projective, space, by, means, of, theta, functions, for, certain, values, of, n, displaystyle, n, this, is, the, jacobian, variety, of, the, riemann, surface, an, example, of, an, abelian, manifold, many, mathematicians, such, as, alfred, clebsch, furthered, riemann, s, work, on, algebraic, curves, these, theories, depended, on, the, properties, of, a, function, defined, on, riemann, surfaces, for, example, the, riemann, roch, theorem, roch, was, a, student, of, riemann, says, something, about, the, number, of, linearly, independent, differentials, with, known, conditions, on, the, zeros, and, poles, of, a, riemann, surface, according, to, detlef, laugwitz, automorphic, functions, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, an, essay, about, the, laplace, equation, on, electrically, charged, cylinders, riemann, however, used, such, functions, for, conformal, maps, such, as, mapping, topological, triangles, to, the, circle, in, his, 1859, lecture, on, hypergeometric, functions, or, in, his, treatise, on, minimal, surfaces, in, the, field, of, real, analysis, he, discovered, the, riemann, integral, in, his, habilitation, among, other, things, he, showed, that, every, piecewise, continuous, function, is, integrable, similarly, the, stieltjes, integral, goes, back, to, the, g, ttinger, mathematician, and, so, they, are, named, together, the, riemann, stieltjes, integral, in, his, habilitation, work, on, fourier, series, where, he, followed, the, work, of, his, teacher, dirichlet, he, showed, that, riemann, integrable, functions, are, representable, by, fourier, series, dirichlet, has, shown, this, for, continuous, piecewise, differentiable, functions, thus, with, countably, many, non, differentiable, points, riemann, gave, an, example, of, a, fourier, series, representing, a, continuous, almost, nowhere, differentiable, function, a, case, not, covered, by, dirichlet, he, also, proved, the, riemann, lebesgue, lemma, if, a, function, is, representable, by, a, fourier, series, then, the, fourier, coefficients, go, to, zero, for, large, n, riemann, s, essay, was, also, the, starting, point, for, georg, cantor, s, work, with, fourier, series, which, was, the, impetus, for, set, theory, he, also, worked, with, hypergeometric, differential, equations, in, 1857, using, complex, analytical, methods, and, presented, the, solutions, through, the, behaviour, of, closed, paths, about, singularities, described, by, the, monodromy, matrix, the, proof, of, the, existence, of, such, differential, equations, by, previously, known, monodromy, matrices, is, one, of, the, hilbert, problems, riemann, made, some, famous, contributions, to, modern, analytic, number, theory, in, a, single, short, paper, the, only, one, he, published, on, the, subject, of, number, theory, he, investigated, the, zeta, function, that, now, bears, his, name, establishing, its, importance, for, understanding, the, distribution, of, prime, numbers, the, riemann, hypothesis, was, one, of, a, series, of, conjectures, he, made, about, the, function, s, properties, in, riemann, s, work, there, are, many, more, interesting, developments, he, proved, the, functional, equation, for, the, zeta, function, already, known, to, leonhard, euler, behind, which, a, theta, function, lies, through, the, summation, of, this, approximation, function, over, the, non, trivial, zeros, on, the, line, with, real, portion, 1, 2, he, gave, an, exact, explicit, formula, for, x, displaystyle, pi, x, riemann, knew, of, pafnuty, chebyshev, s, work, on, the, prime, number, theorem, he, had, visited, dirichlet, in, 1852, riemann, s, works, include
