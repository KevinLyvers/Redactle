not, to, publicize, his, ideas, for, clerical, rule, outside, of, his, islamic, network, of, opposition, to, the, shah, and, so, not, frighten, away, the, secular, middle, class, from, his, movement, his, movement, emphasized, populism, talking, about, fighting, for, the, mustazafin, a, quranic, term, for, the, oppressed, or, deprived, that, in, this, context, came, to, mean, just, about,

over, 20, 000, properties, and, buildings, throughout, iran, a, political, resource, the, secular, middle, class, and, shiite, socialists, could, not, hope, to, compete, with, aware, of, the, importance, of, broadening, his, base, khomeini, reached, out, to, islamic, reformist, and, secular, enemies, of, the, shah, groups, that, were, suppressed, after, he, took, and, consolidated, power,

people, to, the, right, path, in, late, 1978, a, rumour, swept, the, country, that, khomeini, s, face, could, be, seen, in, the, full, moon, millions, of, people, were, said, to, have, seen, it, and, the, event, was, celebrated, in, thousands, of, mosques, the, phenomenon, was, thought, to, demonstrate, that, by, late, 1978, he, was, increasingly, regarded, as, a, messianic, figure, in, iran, and, perceived, by, many, as, the, spiritual, as, well, as, political, leader, of, the, revolt, as, protests, grew, so, did, his, profile, and, importance, although, several, thousand, kilometers, away, from, iran, in, paris, khomeini, set, the, course, of, the, revolution, urging, iranians, not, to, compromise, and, ordering, work, stoppages, against, the, regime, during, the, last, few, months, of, his, exile, khomeini, received, a, constant, stream, of, reporters, supporters, and, notables, eager, to, hear, the, spiritual, leader, of, the, revolution, while, in, exile, khomeini, developed, what, historian, ervand, abrahamian, described, as, a, populist, clerical, version, of, shii, islam, khomeini, modified, previous, shii, interpretations, of, islam, in, a, number, of, ways, that, included, aggressive, approaches, to, espousing, the, general, interests, of, the, mostazafin, forcefully, arguing, that, the, clergy, s, sacred, duty, was, to, take, over, the, state, so, that, it, could, implement, shari, a, and, exhorting, followers, to, protest, despite, their, ideological, differences, khomeini, also, allied, with, the, people, s, mujahedin, of, iran, during, the, early, 1970s, and, started, funding, their, armed, operations, against, the, shah, according, to, the, bbc, khomeini, s, contact, with, the, us, is, part, of, a, trove, of, newly, declassified, us, government, documents, diplomatic, cables, policy, memos, meeting, records, the, documents, suggest, that, the, carter, administration, helped, khomeini, return, to, iran, by, preventing, the, iranian, army, from, launching, a, military, coup, and, that, khomeini, told, an, american, in, france, to, convey, a, message, to, washington, that, there, should, be, no, fear, about, oil, it, is, not, true, that, we, wouldn, t, sell, to, the, us, the, guardian, wrote, that, it, did, not, have, access, to, the, newly, declassified, documents, and, was, not, able, to, independently, verify, them, however, it, did, confirm, khomeini, s, contact, with, the, kennedy, administration, and, claims, of, support, for, us, interest, in, iran, particularly, oil, through, a, cia, analysis, report, titled, islam, in, iran, according, to, a, 1980, cia, study, in, november, 1963, ayatollah, khomeini, sent, a, message, to, the, united, states, government, through, haj, mirza, khalil, kamarei, where, he, expressed, that, he, was, not, opposed, to, american, interests, in, iran, on, the, contrary, he, thought, the, american, presence, was, necessary, as, a, counterbalance, to, soviet, and, possibly, british, influence, according, to, the, bbc, these, document, show, that, in, his, long, quest, for, power, he, was, tactically, flexible, he, played, the, moderate, even, pro, american, card, to, take, control, but, once, change, had, come, he, put, in, place, an, anti, america, legacy, that, would, last, for, decades, supreme, leader, ayatollah, ali, khamenei, denied, the, report,

freedom, of, religion, the, fatw, has, also, been, attacked, for, violating, the, rules, of, fiqh, by, not, allowing, the, accused, an, opportunity, to, defend, himself, and, because, even, the, most, rigorous, and, extreme, of, the, classical, jurist, only, require, a, muslim, to, kill, anyone, who, insults, the, prophet, in, his, hearing, and, in, his, presence, though, rushdie, publicly,

jewish, population, in, iran, dropped, from, 80, 000, to, 30, 000, the, zoroastrian, population, has, also, decreased, due, to, suffering, from, renewed, persecution, and, the, revived, legal,

included, language, rights, and, the, provision, for, a, degree, of, political, autonomy, khomeini, responded, that, such, demands, were, unacceptable, since, it, involved, the, division, of, the,

cases, armed, soldiers, were, compelled, to, fire, warning, shots, in, the, air, to, restrain, the, crowds, at, one, point, khomeini, s, body, fell, to, the, ground, as, the, crowd, ripped, off, pieces, of, the, death, shroud, trying, to, keep, them, as, if, they, were, holy, relics, according, to, journalist, james, buchan, yet, even, here, the, crowd, surged, past, the, makeshift, barriers, john, kifner, wrote, in, the, new, york, times, that, the, body, of, the, ayatollah, wrapped, in, a, white, burial, shroud, fell, out, of, the, flimsy, wooden, coffin, and, in, a, mad, scene, people, in, the, crowd, reached, to, touch, the, shroud, a, frail, white, leg, was, uncovered, the, shroud, was, torn, to, pieces, for, relics, and, khomeini, s, son, ahmad, was, knocked, from, his, feet,

grand, ayatollah, hussein, ali, montazeri, a, former, student, of, khomeini, and, a, major, figure, of, the, revolution, was, chosen, by, khomeini, to, be, his, successor, as, supreme, leader, and, approved, as, such, by, the, assembly, of, experts, in, november, 1985, the, principle, of, velayat, e, faqih, and, the, islamic, constitution, called, for, the, supreme, leader, to, be, a, marja, a, grand, ayatollah, and, of, the, dozen, or, so, grand, ayatollahs, living, in, 1981, only, montazeri, qualified, as, a, potential, leader, this, was, either, because, only, he, accepted, totally, khomeini, s, concept, of, rule, by, islamic, jurists, or, as, at, least, one, other, source, stated, because, only, montazeri, had, the, political, credentials, khomeini, found, suitable, for, his, successor, the, execution, of, mehdi, hashemi, in, september, 1987, on, charges, of, counterrevolutionary, activities, was, a, blow, to, ayatollah, montazeri, who, knew, hashemi, since, their, childhood, in, 1989, montazeri, began, to, call, for, liberalization, freedom, for, political, parties, following, the, execution, of, thousands, of, political, prisoners, by, the, islamic, government, montazeri, told, khomeini, your, prisons, are, far, worse, than, those, of, the, shah, and, his, savak, after, a, letter, of, his, complaints, was, leaked, to, europe, and, broadcast, on, the, bbc, a, furious, khomeini, ousted, him, in, march, 1989, from, his, position, as, official, successor, his, portraits, were, removed, from, offices, and, mosques, to, deal, with, the, disqualification, of, the, only, suitable, marja, khomeini, called, for, an, assembly, for, revising, the, constitution, to, be, convened, an, amendment, was, made, to, iran, s, constitution, removing, the, requirement, that, the, supreme, leader, be, a, marja, and, this, allowed, ali, khamenei, the, new, favoured, jurist, who, had, suitable, revolutionary, credentials, but, lacked, scholarly, ones, and, who, was, not, a, grand, ayatollah, to, be, designated, as, successor, ayatollah, khamenei, was, elected, supreme, leader, by, the, assembly, of, experts, on, 4, june, 1989, montazeri, continued, his, criticism, of, the, regime, and, in, 1997, was, put, under, house, arrest, for, questioning, what, he, regarded, to, be, an, unaccountable, rule, exercised, by, the, supreme, leader, the, anniversary, of, khomeini, s, death, is, a, public, holiday, to, commemorate, khomeini, people, visit, his, mausoleum, placed, on, behesht, e, zahra, to, hear, sermons, and, practice, prayers, on, his, death, day, according, to, at, least, one, scholar, politics, in, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, are, largely, defined, by, attempts, to, claim, khomeini, s, legacy, and, that, staying, faithful, to, his, ideology, has, been, the, litmus, test, for, all, political, activity, there, throughout, his, many, writings, and, speeches, khomeini, s, views, on, governance, evolved, originally, declaring, rule, by, monarchs, or, others, permissible, so, long, as, sharia, law, was, followed, khomeini, later, adamantly, opposed, monarchy, arguing, that, only, rule, by, a, leading, islamic, jurist, a, marja, would, ensure, sharia, was, properly, followed, vel, yat, e, faqih, before, finally, insisting, the, ruling, jurist, need, not, be, a, leading, one, and, sharia, rule, could, be, overruled, by, that, jurist, if, necessary, to, serve, the, interests, of, islam, and, the, divine, government, of, the, islamic, state, khomeini, s, concept, of, guardianship, of, the, islamic, jurist, velayat, e, faqih, as, islamic, government, did, not, win, the, support, of, the, leading, iranian, shi, i, clergy, of, the, time, towards, the, 1979, revolution, many, clerics, gradually, became, disillusioned, with, the, rule, of, the, shah, although, none, came, around, to, supporting, khomeini, s, vision, of, a, theocratic, islamic, republic, khomeini, has, been, described, as, the, virtual, face, of, shia, islam, in, western, popular, culture, there, is, much, debate, to, as, whether, khomeini, s, ideas, are, or, are, not, compatible, with, democracy, and, whether, he, intended, the, islamic, republic, to, be, a, democratic, republic, according, to, the, state, run, aftab, news, both, ultraconservative, supporters, mohammad, taghi, mesbah, yazdi, and, reformist, opponents, of, the, regime, akbar, ganji, and, abdolkarim, soroush, believe, he, did, not, while, regime, officials, and, supporters, like, ali, khamenei, mohammad, khatami, and, mortaza, motahhari, maintain, the, islamic, republic, is, democratic, as, khomeini, intended, it, to, be, khomeini, himself, also, made, statements, at, different, times, indicating, both, support, and, opposition, to, democracy, one, scholar, shaul, bakhash, explains, this, contradiction, as, coming, from, khomeini, s, belief, that, the, huge, turnout, of, iranians, in, anti, shah, demonstrations, during, the, revolution, constituted, a, referendum, in, favor, of, an, islamic, republic, more, important, than, any, elections, khomeini, also, wrote, that, since, muslims, must, support, a, government, based, on, islamic, law, sharia, based, government, will, always, have, more, popular, support, in, muslim, countries, than, any, government, based, on, elected, representatives, khomeini, s, policies, aimed, to, position, iran, as, the, champion, of, all, muslims, regardless, of, sect, by, making, iran, to, be, the, main, hardline, opponent, of, the, jewish, state, khomeini, offered, himself, as, a, champion, of, islamic, revival, and, unity, emphasizing, issues, muslims, agreed, upon, the, fight, against, zionism, and, imperialism, and, downplaying, shia, issues, that, would, divide, shia, from, sunni, the, egyptian, jihadist, ideologue, sayyid, qutb, was, an, important, source, of, influence, to, khomeini, and, the, 1979, iranian, revolution, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, under, khomeini, honoured, qutb, s, martyrdom, by, issuing, an, iconic, postage, stamp, in, 1984, and, before, the, revolution, prominent, figures, in, the, khomeini, network, translated, qutb, s, works, into, persian, while, he, publicly, spoke, of, islamic, unity, and, minimized, differences, with, sunni, muslims, he, is, accused, by, some, of, privately, rebuking, sunni, islam, as, heretical, and, covertly, promoted, an, anti, sunni, foreign, policy, in, the, region, khomeini, has, also, been, lauded, as, politically, astute, a, charismatic, leader, of, immense, popularity, a, champion, of, islamic, revival, by, shia, scholars, and, a, major, innovator, in, political, theory, and, religious, oriented, populist, political, strategy, khomeini, strongly, opposed, close, relations, with, either, eastern, or, western, bloc, nations, believing, the, islamic, world, should, be, its, own, bloc, or, rather, converge, into, a, single, unified, power, he, viewed, western, culture, as, being, inherently, decadent, and, a, corrupting, influence, upon, the, youth, the, islamic, republic, banned, or, discouraged, popular, western, fashions, music, cinema, and, literature, in, the, western, world, it, is, said, his, glowering, visage, became, the, virtual, face, of, islam, in, western, popular, culture, and, inculcated, fear, and, distrust, towards, islam, making, the, word, ayatollah, a, synonym, for, a, dangerous, madman, in, popular, parlance, this, has, particularly, been, the, case, in, the, united, states, where, some, iranians, complained, that, even, at, universities, they, felt, the, need, to, hide, their, iranian, identity, for, fear, of, physical, attack, there, khomeini, and, the, islamic, republic, are, remembered, for, the, american, embassy, hostage, taking, and, accused, of, sponsoring, hostage, taking, and, terrorist, attacks, and, which, continues, to, apply, economic, sanctions, against, iran, before, taking, power, khomeini, expressed, support, for, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, we, would, like, to, act, according, to, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, we, would, like, to, be, free, we, would, like, independence, however, once, in, power, khomeini, took, a, firm, line, against, dissent, warning, opponents, of, theocracy, for, example, i, repeat, for, the, last, time, abstain, from, holding, meetings, from, blathering, from, publishing, protests, otherwise, i, will, break, your, teeth, many, of, khomeini, s, political, and, religious, ideas, were, considered, to, be, progressive, and, reformist, by, leftist, intellectuals, and, activists, prior, to, the, revolution, however, once, in, power, his, ideas, often, clashed, with, those, of, modernist, or, secular, iranian, intellectuals, this, conflict, came, to, a, head, during, the, writing, of, the, islamic, constitution, when, many, newspapers, were, closed, by, the, government, khomeini, angrily, told, the, intellectuals, yes, we, are, reactionaries, and, you, are, enlightened, intellectuals, you, intellectuals, do, not, want, us, to, go, back, 1400, years, you, who, want, freedom, freedom, for, everything, the, freedom, of, parties, you, who, want, all, the, freedoms, you, intellectuals, freedom, that, will, corrupt, our, youth, freedom, that, will, pave, the, way, for, the, oppressor, freedom, that, will, drag, our, nation, to, the, bottom, in, contrast, to, his, alienation, from, iranian, intellectuals, and, in, an, utter, departure, from, all, other, islamist, movements, khomeini, embraced, international, revolution, and, third, world, solidarity, giving, it, precedence, over, muslim, fraternity, from, the, time, khomeini, s, supporters, gained, control, of, the, media, until, his, death, the, iranian, media, devoted, extensive, coverage, to, non, muslim, revolutionary, movements, from, the, sandinistas, to, the, african, national, congress, and, the, irish, republican, army, and, downplayed, the, role, of, the, islamic, movements, considered, conservative, such, as, the, afghan, mujahidin, khomeini, s, supporters, and, pro, government, media, in, iran, also, claim, that, he, was, a, fighter, against, racism, khomeini, was, a, staunch, critic, of, the, apartheid, regime, in, south, africa, after, the, 1979, iranian, revolution, anti, apartheid, activist, and, african, national, congress, president, oliver, tambo, sent, a, letter, to, congratulate, khomeini, for, the, success, of, the, revolution, former, south, african, president, nelson, mandela, claimed, several, times, that, khomeini, served, as, an, inspiration, for, the, anti, apartheid, movement, during, the, 1979, iran, hostage, crisis, khomeini, ordered, the, release, of, all, female, and, african, american, staff, working, there, khomeini, s, legacy, to, the, economy, of, the, islamic, republic, has, been, expressions, of, concern, for, the, mustazafin, a, quranic, term,

demolition, of, their, shantytowns, and, rising, food, prices, etc, khomeini, s, disdain, for, the, science, of, economics, is, said, to, have, been, mirrored, by, the, populist, redistribution, policies, of, former, president, mahmoud, ahmadinejad, who, allegedly, wears, his, contempt, for, economic, orthodoxy, as, a, badge, of, honour, and, has, overseen, sluggish, growth, and, rising, inflation, and, unemployment, in, 1963, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, wrote, a, book, in, which, he, stated, that, there, is, no, religious, restriction, on, corrective, surgery, for, transgender, individuals, at, the, time, khomeini, was, an, anti, shah, revolutionary, and, his, fatwas, did, not, carry, any, weight, with, the, imperial, government, which, did, not, have, any, specific, policies, regarding, transsexual, individuals, however, after, 1979, his, fatwa, formed, the, basis, for, a, national, policy, and, perhaps, in, part, because, of, a, penal, code, that, allows, for, the, execution, of, homosexuals, as, of, 2005, iran, permits, and, partly, finances, seven, times, as, many, gender, reassignment, operations, as, the, entire, european, union, khomeini, was,

on, time, and, he, wakes, up, exactly, on, time, he, changes, his, cloak, every, time, he, comes, back, from, the, mosque, khomeini, was, also, known, for, his, aloofness, and, austere, demeanor, he, is, said, to, have, had, variously, inspired, admiration, awe, and, fear, from, those, around, him, his, practice, of, moving, through, the, halls, of, the, madresehs, never, smiling, at, anybody, or, anything, his, practice, of, ignoring, his, audience, while, he, taught, contributed, to, his, charisma, khomeini, adhered, to, traditional, beliefs, of, islamic, hygienical, jurisprudence, holding, that, things, like, urine, excrement, blood, wine, and, also, non, muslims, were, some, of, the, eleven, ritualistically, impure, things, that, physical, contact, with, which, while, wet, required,

to, baqer, moin, with, the, success, of, the, revolution, not, only, had, a, personality, cult, developed, around, khomeini, but, he, had, been, transformed, into, a, semi, divine, figure, he, was, no, longer, a, grand, ayatollah, and, deputy, of, the, imam, one, who, represents, the, hidden, imam, but, simply, the, imam, khomeini, s, cult, of, personality, fills, a, central, position, in, foreign, and, domestically, targeted, iranian, publications, the, methods, used, to, create, his, personality, cult, have, been, compared, to, those, used, by, such, figures, as, joseph, stalin, mao, zedong, and, fidel, castro, an, eight, century, hadith, attributed, to, the, imam, musa, al, kazim, that, said, a, man, will, come, out, from, qom, and, he, will, summon, people, to, the, right, path, there, will, rally, to, him, people, resembling, pieces, of, iron, not, to, be, shaken, by, violent, winds, unsparing, and, relying, on, god, was, repeated, in, iran, as, a, tribute, to, khomeini, in, lebanon, however, this, saying, was, also, attributed, to, musa, al, sadr, khomeini, was, the, first, and, only, iranian, cleric, to, be, addressed, as, imam, a, title, hitherto, reserved, in, iran,

officials, of, the, overthrown, shah, s, government, executed, by, revolutionary, courts, were, convicted, of, fighting, against, the, twelfth, imam, when, a, deputy, in, the, majlis, asked, khomeini, directly, if, he, was, the, promised, mahdi, khomeini, did, not, answer, astutely, neither, confirming, nor, denying, the, title, as, the, revolution, gained, momentum, even, some, non, supporters, exhibited, awe, towards, khomeini, called, him, magnificently, clear, minded, single, minded, and, unswerving, his, image, was, as, absolute, wise, and, indispensable, leader, of, the, nation, the, imam, it, was, generally, believed, had, shown, by, his, uncanny, sweep, to, power, that, he, knew, how, to, act, in, ways, which, others, could, not, begin, to, understand, his, timing, was, extraordinary, and, his, insight, into, the, motivation, of, others, those, around, him, as, well, as, his, enemies, could, not, be, explained, as, ordinary, knowledge, this, emergent, belief, in, khomeini, as, a, divinely, guided, figure, was, carefully, fostered, by, the, clerics, who, supported, him, and, spoke, up, for, him, in, front, of, the, people, even, many, secularists, who, firmly, disapproved, of, his, policies, were, said, to, feel, the, power, of, his, messianic, appeal, comparing, him, to, a, father, figure, who, retains, the, enduring, loyalty, even, of, children, he, disapproves, of, journalist, afshin, molavi, writes, that, defenses, of, khomeini, are, heard, in, the, most, unlikely, settings, a, whiskey, drinking, professor, told, an, american, journalist, that,
