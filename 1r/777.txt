liberalism, he, contributed, widely, to, social, theory, political, theory, and, political, economy, dubbed, the, most, influential, english, speaking, philosopher, of, the, nineteenth, century, by, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, he, conceived, of, liberty, as, justifying, the, freedom, of, the, individual, in, opposition, to, unlimited, state, and, social, control, mill, was, a, proponent, of, utilitarianism, an, ethical, theory, developed, by, his, predecessor, jeremy, bentham, he, contributed, to, the, investigation, of, scientific, methodology, though, his, knowledge, of, the, topic, was, based, on, the, writings, of, others, notably, william, whewell, john, herschel, and, auguste, comte, and, research, carried, out, for, mill, by, alexander, bain, he, engaged, in, written, debate, with, whewell, a, member, of, the, liberal, party, and, author, of, the, early, feminist, work, the, subjection, of, women, mill, was, also, the, second, member, of, parliament, to, call, for, women, s, suffrage, after, henry, hunt, in, 1832, john, stuart, mill, was, born, at, 13, rodney, street, in, pentonville, then, on, the, edge, of, the, capital, and, now, in, central, london, the, eldest, son, of, harriet, barrow, and, the, scottish, philosopher, historian, and, economist, james, mill, john, stuart, was, educated, by, his, father, with, the, advice, and, assistance, of, jeremy, bentham, and, francis, place, he, was, given, an, extremely, rigorous, upbringing, and, was, deliberately, shielded, from, association, with, children, his, own, age, other, than, his, siblings, his, father, a, follower, of, bentham, and, an, adherent, of, associationism, had, as, his, explicit, aim, to, create, a, genius, intellect, that, would, carry, on, the, cause, of, utilitarianism, and, its, implementation, after, he, and, bentham, had, died, mill, was, a, notably, precocious, child, he, describes, his, education, in, his, autobiography, at, the, age, of, three, he, was, taught, greek, by, the, age, of, eight, he, had, read, aesop, s, fables, xenophon, s, anabasis, and, the, whole, of, herodotus, and, was, acquainted, with, lucian, diogenes, la, rtius, isocrates, and, six, dialogues, of, plato, he, had, also, read, a, great, deal, of, history, in, english, and, had, been, taught, arithmetic, physics, and, astronomy, at, the, age, of, eight, mill, began, studying, latin, the, works, of, euclid, and, algebra, and, was, appointed, schoolmaster, to, the, younger, children, of, the, family, his, main, reading, was, still, history, but, he, went, through, all, the, commonly, taught, latin, and, greek, authors, and, by, the, age, of, ten, could, read, plato, and, demosthenes, with, ease, his, father, also, thought, that, it, was, important, for, mill, to, study, and, compose, poetry, one, of, his, earliest, poetic, compositions, was, a, continuation, of, the, iliad, in, his, spare, time, he, also, enjoyed, reading, about, natural, sciences, and, popular, novels, such, as, don, quixote, and, robinson, crusoe, his, father, s, work, the, history, of, british, india, was, published, in, 1818, immediately, thereafter, at, about, the, age, of, twelve, mill, began, a, thorough, study, of, the, scholastic, logic, at, the, same, time, reading, aristotle, s, logical, treatises, in, the, original, language, in, the, following, year, he, was, introduced, to, political, economy, and, studied, adam, smith, and, david, ricardo, with, his, father, ultimately, completing, their, classical, economic, view, of, factors, of, production, mill, s, comptes, rendus, of, his, daily, economy, lessons, helped, his, father, in, writing, elements, of, political, economy, in, 1821, a, textbook, to, promote, the, ideas, of, ricardian, economics, however, the, book, lacked, popular, support, ricardo, who, was, a, close, friend, of, his, father, used, to, invite, the, young, mill, to, his, house, for, a, walk, to, talk, about, political, economy, at, the, age, of, fourteen, mill, stayed, a, year, in, france, with, the, family, of, sir, samuel, bentham, brother, of, jeremy, bentham, and, in, the, company, of, george, ensor, then, pursuing, his, polemic, against, the, political, economy, of, thomas, malthus, the, mountain, scenery, he, saw, led, to, a, lifelong, taste, for, mountain, landscapes, the, lively, and, friendly, way, of, life, of, the, french, also, left, a, deep, impression, on, him, in, montpellier, he, attended, the, winter, courses, on, chemistry, zoology, logic, of, the, facult, des, sciences, as, well, as, taking, a, course, in, higher, mathematics, while, coming, and, going, from, france, he, stayed, in, paris, for, a, few, days, in, the, house, of, the, renowned, economist, jean, baptiste, say, a, friend, of, mill, s, father, there, he, met, many, leaders, of, the, liberal, party, as, well, as, other, notable, parisians, including, henri, saint, simon, mill, went, through, months, of, sadness, and, contemplated, suicide, at, twenty, years, of, age, according, to, the, opening, paragraphs, of, chapter, v, of, his, autobiography, he, had, asked, himself, whether, the, creation, of, a, just, society, his, life, s, objective, would, actually, make, him, happy, his, heart, answered, no, and, unsurprisingly, he, lost, the, happiness, of, striving, towards, this, objective, eventually, the, poetry, of, william, wordsworth, showed, him, that, beauty, generates, compassion, for, others, and, stimulates, joy, with, renewed, vigour, he, continued, to, work, towards, a, just, society, but, with, more, relish, for, the, journey, he, considered, this, one, of, the, most, pivotal, shifts, in, his, thinking, in, fact, many, of, the, differences, between, him, and, his, father, stemmed, from, this, expanded, source, of, joy, mill, met, thomas, carlyle, during, one, of, the, latter, s, visits, to, london, in, the, early, 1830s, and, the, two, quickly, became, companions, and, correspondents, mill, offered, to, print, carlyle, s, works, at, his, own, expense, and, encouraged, carlyle, to, write, his, french, revolution, supplying, him, with, materials, in, order, to, do, so, in, march, 1835, while, the, manuscript, of, the, completed, first, volume, was, in, mill, s, possession, mill, s, housemaid, unwittingly, used, it, as, tinder, destroying, all, except, some, three, or, four, bits, of, leaves, mortified, mill, offered, carlyle, 200, 17, 742, 16, in, 2021, as, compensation, carlyle, would, only, accept, 100, ideological, differences, would, put, an, end, to, the, friendship, during, the, 1840s, though, carlyle, s, early, influence, on, mill, would, colour, his, later, thought, mill, had, been, engaged, in, a, pen, friendship, with, auguste, comte, the, founder, of, positivism, and, sociology, since, mill, first, contacted, comte, in, november, 1841, comte, s, sociologie, was, more, an, early, philosophy, of, science, than, modern, sociology, is, comte, s, positivism, motivated, mill, to, eventually, reject, bentham, s, psychological, egoism, and, what, he, regarded, as, bentham, s, cold, abstract, view, of, human, nature, focused, on, legislation, and, politics, instead, coming, to, favour, comte, s, more, sociable, view, of, human, nature, focused, on, historical, facts, and, directed, more, towards, human, individuals, in, all, their, complexities, as, a, nonconformist, who, refused, to, subscribe, to, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, the, church, of, england, mill, was, not, eligible, to, study, at, the, university, of, oxford, or, the, university, of, cambridge, instead, he, followed, his, father, to, work, for, the, east, india, company, and, attended, university, college, london, to, hear, the, lectures, of, john, austin, the, first, professor, of, jurisprudence, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1856, mill, s, career, as, a, colonial, administrator, at, the, east, india, company, spanned, from, when, he, was, 17, years, old, in, 1823, until, 1858, when, the, company, s, territories, in, india, were, directly, annexed, by, the, crown, establishing, direct, crown, control, over, india, in, 1836, he, was, promoted, to, the, company, s, political, department, where, he, was, responsible, for, correspondence, pertaining, to, the, company, s, relations, with, the, princely, states, and, in, 1856, was, finally, promoted, to, the, position, of, examiner, of, indian, correspondence, in, on, liberty, a, few, words, on, non, intervention, and, other, works, he, opined, that, to, characterize, any, conduct, whatever, towards, a, barbarous, people, as, a, violation, of, the, law, of, nations, only, shows, that, he, who, so, speaks, has, never, considered, the, subject, however, mill, immediately, added, that, a, violation, of, the, great, principles, of, morality, it, may, easily, be, mill, viewed, places, such, as, india, as, having, once, been, progressive, in, their, outlook, but, had, now, become, stagnant, in, their, development, he, opined, that, this, meant, these, regions, had, to, be, ruled, via, a, form, of, benevolent, despotism, provided, the, end, is, improvement, when, the, crown, proposed, to, take, direct, control, over, the, territories, of, the, east, india, company, mill, was, tasked, with, defending, company, rule, and, penned, memorandum, on, the, improvements, in, the, administration, of, india, during, the, last, thirty, years, among, other, petitions, he, was, offered, a, seat, on, the, council, of, india, the, body, created, to, advise, the, new, secretary, of, state, for, india, but, declined, citing, disapproval, of, the, new, system, of, administration, in, india, on, 21, april, 1851, mill, married, harriet, taylor, after, 21, years, of, intimate, friendship, taylor, was, married, when, they, met, and, their, relationship, was, close, but, generally, believed, to, be, chaste, during, the, years, before, her, first, husband, died, in, 1849, the, couple, waited, two, years, before, marrying, in, 1851, upon, marriage, he, made, a, declaration, to, repudiate, the, rights, conferred, upon, him, over, her, by, virtue, of, the, marriage, under, victorian, law, accomplished, in, her, own, right, taylor, was, a, significant, influence, on, mill, s, work, and, ideas, during, both, friendship, and, marriage, his, relationship, with, taylor, reinforced, mill, s, advocacy, of, women, s, rights, he, said, that, in, his, stand, against, domestic, violence, and, for, women, s, rights, he, was, chiefly, an, amanuensis, to, my, wife, he, called, her, mind, a, perfect, instrument, and, said, she, was, the, most, eminently, qualified, of, all, those, known, to, the, author, he, cites, her, influence, in, his, final, revision, of, on, liberty, which, was, published, shortly, after, her, death, taylor, died, in, 1858, after, developing, severe, lung, congestion, after, only, seven, years, of, marriage, to, mill, between, the, years, 1865, and, 1868, mill, served, as, lord, rector, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, at, his, inaugural, address, delivered, to, the, university, on, 1, february, 1867, he, made, the, now, famous, but, often, wrongly, attributed, remark, that, bad, men, need, nothing, more, to, compass, their, ends, than, that, good, men, should, look, on, and, do, nothing, that, mill, included, that, sentence, in, the, address, is, a, matter, of, historical, record, but, it, by, no, means, follows, that, it, expressed, a, wholly, original, insight, during, the, same, period, 1865, 68, he, was, also, a, member, of, parliament, mp, for, city, of, westminster, he, was, sitting, for, the, liberal, party, during, his, time, as, an, mp, mill, advocated, easing, the, burdens, on, ireland, in, 1866, he, became, the, first, person, in, the, history, of, parliament, to, call, for, women, to, be, given, the, right, to, vote, vigorously, defending, this, position, in, subsequent, debate, he, also, became, a, strong, advocate, of, such, social, reforms, as, labour, unions, and, farm, cooperatives, in, considerations, on, representative, government, he, called, for, various, reforms, of, parliament, and, voting, especially, proportional, representation, the, single, transferable, vote, and, the, extension, of, suffrage, in, april, 1868, he, favoured, in, a, commons, debate, the, retention, of, capital, punishment, for, such, crimes, as, aggravated, murder, he, termed, its, abolition, an, effeminacy, in, the, general, mind, of, the, country, it, is, said, in, 1868, when, his, first, term, ended, no, party, would, nominate, him, due, to, his, independent, spirit, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1867, he, was, godfather, to, the, philosopher, bertrand, russell, in, his, views, on, religion, mill, was, an, agnostic, and, a, sceptic, mill, died, on, 7, may, 1873, at, the, age, of, 66, of, erysipelas, in, avignon, france, where, his, body, was, buried, alongside, his, wife, s, mill, joined, the, debate, over, the, scientific, method, which, followed, on, from, john, herschel, s, 1830, publication, of, a, preliminary, discourse, on, the, study, of, natural, philosophy, which, incorporated, inductive, reasoning, from, the, known, to, the, unknown, discovering, general, laws, in, specific, facts, and, verifying, these, laws, empirically, william, whewell, expanded, on, this, in, his, 1837, history, of, the, inductive, sciences, from, the, earliest, to, the, present, time, followed, in, 1840, by, the, philosophy, of, the, inductive, sciences, founded, upon, their, history, presenting, induction, as, the, mind, superimposing, concepts, on, facts, laws, were, self, evident, truths, which, could, be, known, without, need, for, empirical, verification, mill, countered, this, in, 1843, in, a, system, of, logic, fully, titled, a, system, of, logic, ratiocinative, and, inductive, being, a, connected, view, of, the, principles, of, evidence, and, the, methods, of, scientific, investigation, in, mill, s, methods, of, induction, as, in, herschel, s, laws, were, discovered, through, observation, and, induction, and, required, empirical, verification, matilal, remarks, that, dign, ga, analysis, is, much, like, john, stuart, mill, s, joint, method, of, agreement, and, difference, which, is, inductive, he, suggested, that, it, was, very, likely, that, during, his, stay, in, india, he, came, across, the, tradition, of, logic, in, which, scholars, started, taking, interest, after, 1824, though, it, is, unknown, whether, it, influenced, his, work, mill, s, on, liberty, 1859, addresses, the, nature, and, limits, of, the, power, that, can, be, legitimately, exercised, by, society, over, the, individual, mill, s, idea, is, that, only, if, a, democratic, society, follows, the, principle, of, liberty, can, its, political, and, social, institutions, fulfill, their, role, of, shaping, national, character, so, that, its, citizens, can, realise, the, permanent, interests, of, people, as, progressive, beings, rawls, lectures, on, the, history, of, political, philosophy, p, 289, mill, states, the, principle, of, liberty, as, the, sole, end, for, which, mankind, are, warranted, individually, or, collectively, in, interfering, with, the, liberty, of, action, of, any, of, their, number, is, self, protection, the, only, purpose, for, which, power, can, be, rightfully, exercised, over, any, member, of, a, civilised, community, against, his, will, is, to, prevent, harm, to, others, his, own, good, either, physical, or, moral, is, not, a, sufficient, warrant, one, way, to, read, mill, s, principle, of, liberty, as, a, principle, of, public, reason, is, to, see, it, excluding, certain, kinds, of, reasons, from, being, taken, into, account, in, legislation, or, in, guiding, the, moral, coercion, of, public, opinion, rawls, lectures, on, the, history, of, political, philosophy, p, 291, these, reasons, include, those, founded, in, other, persons, good, reasons, of, excellence, and, ideals, of, human, perfection, reasons, of, dislike, or, disgust, or, of, preference, mill, states, that, harms, which, may, be, prevented, include, acts, of, omission, as, well, as, acts, of, commission, thus, failing, to, rescue, a, drowning, child, counts, as, a, harmful, act, as, does, failing, to, pay, taxes, or, failing, to, appear, as, a, witness, in, court, all, such, harmful, omissions, may, be, regulated, according, to, mill, by, contrast, it, does, not, count, as, harming, someone, if, without, force, or, fraud, the, affected, individual, consents, to, assume, the, risk, thus, one, may, permissibly, offer, unsafe, employment, to, others, provided, there, is, no, deception, involved, he, does, however, recognise, one, limit, to, consent, society, should, not, permit, people, to, sell, themselves, into, slavery, the, question, of, what, counts, as, a, self, regarding, action, and, what, actions, whether, of, omission, or, commission, constitute, harmful, actions, subject, to, regulation, continues, to, exercise, interpreters, of, mill, he, did, not, consider, giving, offence, to, constitute, harm, an, action, could, not, be, restricted, because, it, violated, the, conventions, or, morals, of, a, given, society, mill, believed, that, the, struggle, between, liberty, and, authority, is, the, most, conspicuous, feature, in, the, portions, of, history, for, him, liberty, in, antiquity, was, a, contest, between, subjects, or, some, classes, of, subjects, and, the, government, mill, defined, social, liberty, as, protection, from, the, tyranny, of, political, rulers, he, introduced, a, number, of, different, concepts, of, the, form, tyranny, can, take, referred, to, as, social, tyranny, and, tyranny, of, the, majority, social, liberty, for, mill, meant, putting, limits, on, the, ruler, s, power, so, that, he, would, not, be, able, to, use, that, power, to, further, his, own, wishes, and, thus, make, decisions, that, could, harm, society, in, other, words, people, should, have, the, right, to, have, a, say, in, the, government, s, decisions, he, said, that, social, liberty, was, the, nature, and, limits, of, the, power, which, can, be, legitimately, exercised, by, society, over, the, individual, it, was, attempted, in, two, ways, first, by, obtaining, recognition, of, certain, immunities, called, political, liberties, or, rights, and, second, by, establishment, of, a, system, of, constitutional, checks, however, in, mill, s, view, limiting, the, power, of, government, was, not, enough, society, can, and, does, execute, its, own, mandates, and, if, it, issues, wrong, mandates, instead, of, right, or, any, mandates, at, all, in, things, with, which, it, ought, not, to, meddle, it, practises, a, social, tyranny, more, formidable, than, many, kinds, of, political, oppression, since, though, not, usually, upheld, by, such, extreme, penalties, it, leaves, fewer, means, of, escape, penetrating, much, more, deeply, into, the, details, of, life, and, enslaving, the, soul, itself, mill, s, view, on, liberty, which, was, influenced, by, joseph, priestley, and, josiah, warren, is, that, individuals, ought, to, be, free, to, do, as, they, wished, unless, they, caused, harm, to, others, individuals, are, rational, enough, to, make, decisions, about, their, well, being, government, should, interfere, when, it, is, for, the, protection, of, society, mill, explained, the, sole, end, for, which, mankind, are, warranted, individually, or, collectively, in, interfering, with, the, liberty, of, action, of, any, of, their, number, is, self, protection, that, the, only, purpose, for, which, power, can, be, rightfully, exercised, over, any, member, of, a, civilized, community, against, his, will, is, to, prevent, harm, to, others, his, own, good, either, physical, or, moral, is, not, sufficient, warrant, he, cannot, rightfully, be, compelled, to, do, or, forbear, because, it, will, be, better, for, him, to, do, so, because, it, will, make, him, happier, because, in, the, opinion, of, others, to, do, so, would, be, wise, or, even, right, the, only, part, of, the, conduct, of, anyone, for, which, he, is, amenable, to, society, is, that, which, concerns, others, in, the, part, which, merely, concerns, him, his, independence, is, of, right, absolute, over, himself, over, his, own, body, and, mind, the, individual, is, sovereign, on, liberty, involves, an, impassioned, defence, of, free, speech, mill, argues, that, free, discourse, is, a, necessary, condition, for, intellectual, and, social, progress, we, can, never, be, sure, he, contends, that, a, silenced, opinion, does, not, contain, some, element, of, the, truth, he, also, argues, that, allowing, people, to, air, false, opinions, is, productive, for, two, reasons, first, individuals, are, more, likely, to, abandon, erroneous, beliefs, if, they, are, engaged, in, an, open, exchange, of, ideas, second, by, forcing, other, individuals, to, re, examine, and, re, affirm, their, beliefs, in, the, process, of, debate, these, beliefs, are, kept, from, declining, into, mere, dogma, it, is, not, enough, for, mill, that, one, simply, has, an, unexamined, belief, that, happens, to, be, true, one, must, understand, why, the, belief, in, question, is, the, true, one, along, those, same, lines, mill, wrote, unmeasured, vituperation, employed, on, the, side, of, prevailing, opinion, really, does, deter, people, from, expressing, contrary, opinions, and, from, listening, to, those, who, express, them, 51, as, an, influential, advocate, of, freedom, of, speech, mill, objected, to, censorship, i, choose, by, preference, the, cases, which, are, least, favourable, to, me, in, which, the, argument, opposing, freedom, of, opinion, both, on, truth, and, that, of, utility, is, considered, the, strongest, let, the, opinions, impugned, be, the, belief, in, god, and, in, a, future, state, or, any, of, the, commonly, received, doctrines, of, morality, but, i, must, be, permitted, to, observe, that, it, is, not, the, feeling, sure, of, a, doctrine, be, it, what, it, may, which, i, call, an, assumption, of, infallibility, it, is, the, undertaking, to, decide, that, question, for, others, without, allowing, them, to, hear, what, can, be, said, on, the, contrary, side, and, i, denounce, and, reprobate, this, pretension, not, the, less, if, put, forth, on, the, side, of, my, most, solemn, convictions, however, positive, any, one, s, persuasion, may, be, not, only, of, the, falsity, but, of, the, pernicious, consequences, not, only, of, the, pernicious, consequences, but, to, adopt, expressions, which, i, altogether, condemn, the, immorality, and, impiety, of, an, opinion, yet, if, in, pursuance, of, that, private, judgment, though, backed, by, the, public, judgment, of, his, country, or, his, contemporaries, he, prevents, the, opinion, from, being, heard, in, its, defence, he, assumes, infallibility, and, so, far, from, the, assumption, being, less, objectionable, or, less, dangerous, because, the, opinion, is, called, immoral, or, impious, this, is, the, case, of, all, others, in, which, it, is, most, fatal, mill, outlines, the, benefits, of, searching, for, and, discovering, the, truth, as, a, way, to, further, knowledge, he, argued, that, even, if, an, opinion, is, false, the, truth, can, be, better, understood, by, refuting, the, error, and, as, most, opinions, are, neither, completely, true, nor, completely, false, he, points, out, that, allowing, free, expression, allows, the, airing, of, competing, views, as, a, way, to, preserve, partial, truth, in, various, opinions, worried, about, minority, views, being, suppressed, he, argued, in, support, of, freedom, of, speech, on, political, grounds, stating, that, it, is, a, critical, component, for, a, representative, government, to, have, to, empower, debate, over, public, policy, he, also, eloquently, argued, that, freedom, of, expression, allows, for, personal, growth, and, self, realization, he, said, that, freedom, of, speech, was, a, vital, way, to, develop, talents, and, realise, a, person, s, potential, and, creativity, he, repeatedly, said, that, eccentricity, was, preferable, to, uniformity, and, stagnation, the, belief, that, freedom, of, speech, would, advance, society, presupposed, a, society, sufficiently, culturally, and, institutionally, advanced, to, be, capable, of, progressive, improvement, if, any, argument, is, really, wrong, or, harmful, the, public, will, judge, it, as, wrong, or, harmful, and, then, those, arguments, cannot, be, sustained, and, will, be, excluded, mill, argued, that, even, any, arguments, which, are, used, in, justifying, murder, or, rebellion, against, the, government, should, not, be, politically, suppressed, or, socially, persecuted, according, to, him, if, rebellion, is, really, necessary, people, should, rebel, if, murder, is, truly, proper, it, should, be, allowed, however, the, way, to, express, those, arguments, should, be, a, public, speech, or, writing, not, in, a, way, that, causes, actual, harm, to, others, such, is, the, harm, principle, that, the, only, purpose, for, which, power, can, be, rightfully, exercised, over, any, member, of, a, civilized, community, against, his, will, is, to, prevent, harm, to, others, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, associate, justice, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, made, the, standard, of, clear, and, present, danger, based, on, mill, s, idea, in, the, majority, opinion, holmes, writes, the, question, in, every, case, is, whether, the, words, used, are, used, in, such, circumstances, and, are, of, such, a, nature, as, to, create, a, clear, and, present, danger, that, they, will, bring, about, the, substantive, evils, that, congress, has, a, right, to, prevent, holmes, suggested, that, falsely, shouting, out, fire, in, a, dark, theatre, which, evokes, panic, and, provokes, injury, would, be, such, a, case, of, speech, that, creates, an, illegal, danger, but, if, the, situation, allows, people, to, reason, by, themselves, and, decide, to, accept, it, or, not, any, argument, or, theology, should, not, be, blocked, here, is, mill, on, the, same, topic, no, one, pretends, that, actions, should, be, as, free, as, opinions, on, the, contrary, even, opinions, lose, their, immunity, when, the, circumstances, in, which, they, are, expressed, are, such, as, to, constitute, their, expression, a, positive, instigation, to, some, mischievous, act, an, opinion, that, corn, dealers, are, starvers, of, the, poor, or, that, private, property, is, robbery, ought, to, be, unmolested, when, simply, circulated, through, the, press, but, may, justly, incur, punishment, when, delivered, orally, to, an, excited, mob, assembled, before, the, house, of, a, corn, dealer, or, when, handed, about, among, the, same, mob, in, the, form, of, a, placard, on, liberty, chapter, 3, mill, s, argument, is, now, generally, accepted, by, many, democratic, countries, and, they, have, laws, at, least, guided, by, the, harm, principle, for, example, in, american, law, some, exceptions, limit, free, speech, such, as, obscenity, defamation, breach, of, peace, and, fighting, words, in, on, liberty, mill, thought, it, was, necessary, for, him, to, restate, the, case, for, press, freedom, he, considered, that, argument, already, won, almost, no, politician, or, commentator, in, mid, 19th, century, britain, wanted, a, return, to, tudor, and, stuart, type, press, censorship, however, mill, warned, new, forms, of, censorship, could, emerge, in, the, future, indeed, in, 2013, the, cameron, tory, government, considered, setting, up, an, independent, official, regulator, of, the, uk, press, this, prompted, demands, for, better, basic, legal, protection, of, press, freedom, a, new, british, bill, of, rights, could, include, a, us, type, constitutional, ban, on, governmental, infringement, of, press, freedom, and, block, other, official, attempts, to, control, freedom, of, opinion, and, expression, mill, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, from, 1823, to, 1858, argued, in, support, of, what, he, called, a, benevolent, despotism, with, regard, to, the, administration, of, overseas, colonies, mill, argued, to, suppose, that, the, same, international, customs, and, the, same, rules, of, international, morality, can, obtain, between, one, civilized, nation, and, another, and, between, civilized, nations, and, barbarians, is, a, grave, error, to, characterize, any, conduct, whatever, towards, a, barbarous, people, as, a, violation, of, the, law, of, nations, only, shows, that, he, who, so, speaks, has, never, considered, the, subject, for, mill, india, was, a, burden, for, england, and, british, colonialism, a, blessing, of, unspeakable, magnitude, to, the, population, of, india, he, also, stated, his, support, for, settler, colonialism, mill, expressed, general, support, for, company, rule, in, india, but, expressed, reservations, on, specific, company, policies, in, india, which, he, disagreed, with, he, also, supported, colonialism, in, other, places, such, as, australia, mill, was, among, the, founding, members, of, the, south, australian, association, in, 1833, which, was, set, up, to, lobby, the, government, to, establish, colonies, in, australia, in, 1850, mill, sent, an, anonymous, letter, which, came, to, be, known, under, the, title, the, negro, question, in, rebuttal, to, thomas, carlyle, s, letter, to, fraser, s, magazine, for, town, and, country, in, which, carlyle, argued, for, slavery, mill, supported, abolishing, slavery, in, the, united, states, expressing, his, opposition, to, slavery, in, his, essay, of, 1869, the, subjection, of, women, this, absolutely, extreme, case, of, the, law, of, force, condemned, by, those, who, can, tolerate, almost, every, other, form, of, arbitrary, power, and, which, of, all, others, presents, features, the, most, revolting, to, the, feeling, of, all, who, look, at, it, from, an, impartial, position, was, the, law, of, civilized, and, christian, england, within, the, memory, of, persons, now, living, and, in, one, half, of, anglo, saxon, america, three, or, four, years, ago, not, only, did, slavery, exist, but, the, slave, trade, and, the, breeding, of, slaves, expressly, for, it, was, a, general, practice, between, slave, states, yet, not, only, was, there, a, greater, strength, of, sentiment, against, it, but, in, england, at, least, a, less, amount, either, of, feeling, or, of, interest, in, favour, of, it, than, of, any, other, of, the, customary, abuses, of, force, for, its, motive, was, the, love, of, gain, unmixed, and, undisguised, and, those, who, profited, by, it, were, a, very, small, numerical, fraction, of, the, country, while, the, natural, feeling, of, all, who, were, not, personally, interested, in, it, was, unmitigated, abhorrence, mill, corresponded, with, john, appleton, an, american, legal, reformer, from, maine, extensively, on, the, topic, of, racial, equality, appleton, influenced, mill, s, work, on, such, especially, swaying, him, on, the, optimal, economic, and, social, welfare, plan, for, the, antebellum, south, in, a, letter, sent, to, appleton, in, response, to, a, previous, letter, mill, expressed, his, view, on, antebellum, integration, i, cannot, look, forward, with, satisfaction, to, any, settlement, but, complete, emancipation, land, given, to, every, negro, family, either, separately, or, in, organized, communities, under, such, rules, as, may, be, found, temporarily, necessary, the, schoolmaster, set, to, work, in, every, village, the, tide, of, free, immigration, turned, on, in, those, fertile, regions, from, which, slavery, has, hitherto, excluded, it, if, this, be, done, the, gentle, docile, character, which, seems, to, distinguish, the, negroes, will, prevent, any, mischief, on, their, side, while, the, proofs, they, are, giving, of, fighting, powers, will, do, more, in, a, year, than, all, other, things, in, a, century, to, make, the, whites, respect, them, consent, to, their, being, politically, socially, equals, unlike, many, of, his, peers, mill, supported, the, union, in, the, american, civil, war, seeing, it, as, a, necessary, evil, that, would, deliver, a, vital, salutary, shock, to, the, national, conscience, and, help, preserve, liberal, ideals, while, eradicating, the, stain, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, mill, expressed, his, views, in, an, article, for, fraser, s, magazine, arguing, against, the, defenders, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, there, are, people, who, tell, us, that, on, the, side, of, the, north, the, question, is, not, one, of, slavery, at, all, the, north, it, seems, have, no, more, objection, to, slavery, than, the, south, have, if, this, be, the, true, state, of, the, case, what, are, the, southern, chiefs, fighting, about, their, apologists, in, england, say, that, it, is, about, tariffs, and, similar, trumpery, they, say, nothing, of, the, kind, they, tell, the, world, and, they, told, their, own, citizens, when, they, wanted, their, votes, that, the, object, of, the, fight, was, slavery, the, world, knows, what, the, question, between, the, north, and, south, has, been, for, many, years, and, still, is, slavery, alone, was, thought, of, alone, talked, of, mill, s, view, of, history, was, that, right, up, until, his, time, the, whole, of, the, female, and, the, great, majority, of, the, male, sex, were, simply, slaves, he, countered, arguments, to, the, contrary, arguing, that, relations, between, sexes, simply, amounted, to, the, legal, subordination, of, one, sex, to, the, other, is, wrong, itself, and, now, one, of, the, chief, hindrances, to, human, improvement, and, that, it, ought, to, be, replaced, by, a, principle, of, perfect, equality, here, then, we, have, an, instance, of, mill, s, use, of, slavery, in, a, sense, which, compared, to, its, fundamental, meaning, of, absolute, unfreedom, of, person, is, an, extended, and, arguably, a, rhetorical, rather, than, a, literal, sense, with, this, mill, can, be, considered, among, the, earliest, male, proponents, of, gender, equality, having, been, recruited, by, american, feminist, john, neal, during, his, stay, in, london, circa, 1825, 1827, his, book, the, subjection, of, women, 1861, publ, 1869, is, one, of, the, earliest, written, on, this, subject, by, a, male, author, in, the, subjection, of, women, mill, attempts, to, make, a, case, for, perfect, equality, in, his, proposal, for, a, universal, education, system, sponsored, by, the, state, mill, expands, benefits, for, many, marginalized, groups, especially, for, women, for, mill, a, universal, education, held, the, potential, to, create, new, abilities, and, novel, types, of, behaviour, of, which, the, current, receiving, generation, and, their, descendants, could, both, benefit, from, such, a, pathway, to, opportunity, would, enable, women, to, gain, industrial, and, social, independence, that, would, allow, them, the, same, movement, in, their, agency, and, citizenship, as, men, mill, s, view, of, opportunity, stands, out, in, its, reach, but, even, more, so, for, the, population, he, foresees, who, could, benefit, from, it, mill, was, hopeful, of, the, autonomy, such, an, education, could, allow, for, its, recipients, and, especially, for, women, through, the, consequential, sophistication, and, knowledge, attained, individuals, are, able, to, properly, act, in, ways, that, recedes, away, from, those, leading, towards, overpopulation, this, stands, directly, in, contrast, with, the, view, held, by, many, of, mill, s, contemporaries, and, predecessors, who, viewed, such, inclusive, programs, to, be, counter, intuitive, aiming, such, help, at, marginalized, groups, such, as, the, poor, and, working, class, would, only, serve, to, reward, them, with, the, opportunity, to, move, to, a, higher, status, thus, encouraging, greater, fertility, which, at, its, extreme, could, lead, to, overproduction, he, talks, about, the, role, of, women, in, marriage, and, how, it, must, be, changed, mill, comments, on, three, major, facets, of, women, s, lives, that, he, felt, are, hindering, them, he, argues, that, the, oppression, of, women, was, one, of, the, few, remaining, relics, from, ancient, times, a, set, of, prejudices, that, severely, impeded, the, progress, of, humanity, as, a, member, of, parliament, mill, introduced, an, unsuccessful, amendment, to, the, reform, bill, to, substitute, the, word, person, in, place, of, man, the, canonical, statement, of, mill, s, utilitarianism, can, be, found, in, his, book, utilitarianism, although, this, philosophy, has, a, long, tradition, mill, s, account, is, primarily, influenced, by, jeremy, bentham, and, mill, s, father, james, mill, john, stuart, mill, believed, in, the, philosophy, of, utilitarianism, which, he, would, describe, as, the, principle, that, holds, that, actions, are, right, in, the, proportion, as, they, tend, to, promote, happiness, wrong, as, they, tend, to, produce, the, reverse, of, happiness, by, happiness, he, means, intended, pleasure, and, the, absence, of, pain, by, unhappiness, pain, and, the, privation, of, pleasure, it, is, clear, that, we, do, not, all, value, virtues, as, a, path, to, happiness, and, that, we, sometimes, only, value, them, for, selfish, reasons, however, mill, asserts, that, upon, reflection, even, when, we, value, virtues, for, selfish, reasons, we, are, in, fact, cherishing, them, as, a, part, of, our, happiness, bentham, s, famous, formulation, of, utilitarianism, is, known, as, the, greatest, happiness, principle, it, holds, that, one, must, always, act, so, as, to, produce, the, greatest, aggregate, happiness, among, all, sentient, beings, within, reason, in, a, similar, vein, mill, s, method, of, determining, the, best, utility, is, that, a, moral, agent, when, given, the, choice, between, two, or, more, actions, ought, to, choose, the, action, that, contributes, most, to, maximizes, the, total, happiness, in, the, world, happiness, in, this, context, is, understood, as, the, production, of, pleasure, or, privation, of, pain, given, that, determining, the, action, that, produces, the, most, utility, is, not, always, so, clear, cut, mill, suggests, that, the, utilitarian, moral, agent, when, attempting, to, rank, the, utility, of, different, actions, should, refer, to, the, general, experience, of, persons, that, is, if, people, generally, experience, more, happiness, following, action, x, than, they, do, action, y, the, utilitarian, should, conclude, that, action, x, produces, more, utility, than, action, y, and, so, is, to, be, preferred, utilitarianism, is, a, consequentialist, ethical, theory, meaning, that, it, holds, that, acts, are, justified, insofar, as, they, produce, a, desirable, outcome, the, overarching, goal, of, utilitarianism, the, ideal, consequence, is, to, achieve, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, as, the, end, result, of, human, action, in, utilitarianism, mill, states, that, happiness, is, the, sole, end, of, human, action, this, statement, aroused, some, controversy, which, is, why, mill, took, it, a, step, further, explaining, how, the, very, nature, of, humans, wanting, happiness, and, who, take, it, to, be, reasonable, under, free, consideration, demands, that, happiness, is, indeed, desirable, in, other, words, free, will, leads, everyone, to, make, actions, inclined, on, their, own, happiness, unless, reasoned, that, it, would, improve, the, happiness, of, others, in, which, case, the, greatest, utility, is, still, being, achieved, to, that, extent, the, utilitarianism, that, mill, is, describing, is, a, default, lifestyle, that, he, believes, is, what, people, who, have, not, studied, a, specific, opposing, field, of, ethics, would, naturally, and, unconsciously, use, when, faced, with, a, decision, utilitarianism, is, thought, of, by, some, of, its, activists, to, be, a, more, developed, and, overarching, ethical, theory, of, immanuel, kant, s, belief, in, goodwill, and, not, just, some, default, cognitive, process, of, humans, where, kant, 1724, 1804, would, argue, that, reason, can, only, be, used, properly, by, goodwill, mill, would, say, that, the, only, way, to, universally, create, fair, laws, and, systems, would, be, to, step, back, to, the, consequences, whereby, kant, s, ethical, theories, become, based, around, the, ultimate, good, utility, by, this, logic, the, only, valid, way, to, discern, what, is, the, proper, reason, would, be, to, view, the, consequences, of, any, action, and, weigh, the, good, and, the, bad, even, if, on, the, surface, the, ethical, reasoning, seems, to, indicate, a, different, train, of, thought, mill, s, major, contribution, to, utilitarianism, is, his, argument, for, the, qualitative, separation, of, pleasures, bentham, treats, all, forms, of, happiness, as, equal, whereas, mill, argues, that, intellectual, and, moral, pleasures, higher, pleasures, are, superior, to, more, physical, forms, of, pleasure, lower, pleasures, he, distinguishes, between, happiness, and, contentment, claiming, that, the, former, is, of, higher, value, than, the, latter, a, belief, wittily, encapsulated, in, the, statement, that, it, is, better, to, be, a, human, being, dissatisfied, than, a, pig, satisfied, better, to, be, socrates, dissatisfied, than, a, fool, satisfied, and, if, the, fool, or, the, pig, are, of, a, different, opinion, it, is, because, they, only, know, their, own, side, of, the, question, this, made, mill, believe, that, our, only, ultimate, end, is, happiness, one, unique, part, of, his, utilitarian, view, that, is, not, seen, in, others, is, the, idea, of, higher, and, lower, pleasures, mill, explains, the, different, pleasures, as, if, i, am, asked, what, i, mean, by, difference, of, quality, in, pleasures, or, what, makes, one, pleasure, more, valuable, than, another, merely, as, a, pleasure, except, its, being, greater, in, amount, there, is, but, one, possible, answer, of, two, pleasures, if, there, be, one, to, which, all, or, almost, all, who, have, experience, of, both, give, a, decided, preference, that, is, the, more, desirable, pleasure, he, defines, higher, pleasures, as, mental, moral, and, aesthetic, pleasures, and, lower, pleasures, as, being, more, sensational, he, believed, that, higher, pleasures, should, be, seen, as, preferable, to, lower, pleasures, since, they, have, a, greater, quality, in, virtue, he, holds, that, pleasures, gained, in, activity, are, of, a, higher, quality, than, those, gained, passively, mill, defines, the, difference, between, higher, and, lower, forms, of, pleasure, with, the, principle, that, those, who, have, experienced, both, tend, to, prefer, one, over, the, other, this, is, perhaps, in, direct, contrast, with, bentham, s, statement, that, quantity, of, pleasure, being, equal, push, pin, is, as, good, as, poetry, that, if, a, simple, child, s, game, like, hopscotch, causes, more, pleasure, to, more, people, than, a, night, at, the, opera, house, it, is, more, incumbent, upon, a, society, to, devote, more, resources, to, propagating, hopscotch, than, running, opera, houses, mill, s, argument, is, that, the, simple, pleasures, tend, to, be, preferred, by, people, who, have, no, experience, with, high, art, and, are, therefore, not, in, a, proper, position, to, judge, he, also, argues, that, people, who, for, example, are, noble, or, practise, philosophy, benefit, society, more, than, those, who, engage, in, individualist, practices, for, pleasure, which, are, lower, forms, of, happiness, it, is, not, the, agent, s, own, greatest, happiness, that, matters, but, the, greatest, amount, of, happiness, altogether, mill, separated, his, explanation, of, utilitarianism, into, five, different, sections, in, the, general, remarks, portion, of, his, essay, he, speaks, how, next, to, no, progress, has, been, made, when, it, comes, to, judging, what, is, right, and, what, is, wrong, of, morality, and, if, there, is, such, a, thing, as, moral, instinct, which, he, argues, that, there, may, not, be, however, he, agrees, that, in, general, our, moral, faculty, according, to, all, those, of, its, interpreters, who, are, entitled, to, the, name, of, thinkers, supplies, us, only, with, the, general, principles, of, moral, judgments, in, what, utilitarianism, is, he, focuses, no, longer, on, background, information, but, utilitarianism, itself, he, quotes, utilitarianism, as, the, greatest, happiness, principle, defining, this, theory, by, saying, that, pleasure, and, no, pain, are, the, only, inherently, good, things, in, the, world, and, expands, on, it, by, saying, that, actions, are, right, in, proportion, as, they, tend, to, promote, happiness, wrong, as, they, tend, to, produce, the, reverse, of, happiness, by, happiness, is, intended, pleasure, and, the, absence, of, pain, by, unhappiness, pain, and, the, privation, of, pleasure, he, views, it, not, as, an, animalistic, concept, because, he, sees, seeking, out, pleasure, as, a, way, of, using, our, higher, facilities, he, also, says, in, this, chapter, that, the, happiness, principle, is, based, not, exclusively, on, the, individual, but, mainly, on, the, community, mill, also, defends, the, idea, of, a, strong, utilitarian, conscience, i, e, a, strong, feeling, of, obligation, to, the, general, happiness, he, argued, that, humans, have, a, desire, to, be, happy, and, that, that, desire, causes, us, to, want, to, be, in, unity, with, other, humans, this, causes, us, to, care, about, the, happiness, of, others, as, well, as, the, happiness, of, complete, strangers, but, this, desire, also, causes, us, to, experience, pain, when, we, perceive, harm, to, other, people, he, believes, in, internal, sanctions, that, make, us, experience, guilt, and, appropriate, our, actions, these, internal, sanctions, make, us, want, to, do, good, because, we, do, not, want, to, feel, guilty, for, our, actions, happiness, is, our, ultimate, end, because, it, is, our, duty, he, argues, that, we, do, not, need, to, be, constantly, motivated, by, the, concern, of, people, s, happiness, because, most, of, the, actions, done, by, people, are, done, out, of, good, intention, and, the, good, of, the, world, is, made, up, of, the, good, of, the, people, in, mill, s, fourth, chapter, of, what, sort, of, proof, the, principle, of, utility, is, susceptible, he, speaks, of, what, proofs, of, utility, are, affected, he, starts, this, chapter, off, by, saying, that, all, of, his, claims, cannot, be, backed, up, by, reasoning, he, claims, that, the, only, proof, that, something, brings, one, pleasure, is, if, someone, finds, it, pleasurable, next, he, talks, about, how, morality, is, the, basic, way, to, achieve, happiness, he, also, discusses, in, this, chapter, that, utilitarianism, is, beneficial, for, virtue, he, says, that, it, maintains, not, only, that, virtue, is, to, be, desired, but, that, it, is, to, be, desired, disinterestedly, for, itself, in, his, final, chapter, he, looks, at, the, connection, between, utilitarianism, and, justice, he, contemplates, the, question, of, whether, justice, is, something, distinct, from, utility, or, not, he, reasons, this, question, in, several, different, ways, and, finally, comes, to, the, conclusion, that, in, certain, cases, justice, is, essential, for, utility, but, in, others, social, duty, is, far, more, important, than, justice, mill, believes, that, justice, must, give, way, to, some, other, moral, principle, but, that, what, is, just, in, ordinary, cases, is, by, reason, of, that, other, principle, not, just, in, the, particular, case, the, qualitative, account, of, happiness, that, mill, advocates, thus, sheds, light, on, his, account, presented, in, on, liberty, as, he, suggests, in, that, text, utility, is, to, be, conceived, in, relation, to, humanity, as, a, progressive, being, which, includes, the, development, and, exercise, of, rational, capacities, as, we, strive, to, achieve, a, higher, mode, of, existence, the, rejection, of, censorship, and, paternalism, is, intended, to, provide, the, necessary, social, conditions, for, the, achievement, of, knowledge, and, the, greatest, ability, for, the, greatest, number, to, develop, and, exercise, their, deliberative, and, rational, capacities, mill, redefines, the, definition, of, happiness, as, the, ultimate, end, for, the, sake, of, which, all, other, things, are, desirable, whether, we, are, considering, our, own, good, or, that, of, other, people, is, an, existence, as, free, as, possible, from, pain, and, as, rich, as, possible, in, enjoyments, he, firmly, believed, that, moral, rules, and, obligations, could, be, referenced, to, promoting, happiness, which, connects, to, having, a, noble, character, while, mill, is, not, a, standard, act, utilitarian, or, rule, utilitarian, he, is, a, minimizing, utilitarian, which, affirms, that, it, would, be, desirable, to, maximize, happiness, for, the, greatest, number, but, not, that, we, are, morally, required, to, do, so, mill, believed, that, for, the, majority, of, people, those, with, but, a, moderate, degree, of, sensibility, and, of, capacity, for, enjoyment, happiness, is, best, achieved, en, passant, rather, than, striving, for, it, directly, this, meant, no, self, consciousness, scrutiny, self, interrogation, dwelling, on, thinking, about, imagining, or, questioning, on, one, s, happiness, then, if, otherwise, fortunately, circumstanced, one, would, inhale, happiness, with, the, air, you, breathe, social, democracy, socialism, communism, northern, ireland, scotland, wales, other, mill, s, early, economic, philosophy, was, one, of, free, markets, however, he, accepted, interventions, in, the, economy, such, as, a, tax, on, alcohol, if, there, were, sufficient, utilitarian, grounds, he, also, accepted, the, principle, of, legislative, intervention, for, the, purpose, of, animal, welfare, he, originally, believed, that, equality, of, taxation, meant, equality, of, sacrifice, and, that, progressive, taxation, penalized, those, who, worked, harder, and, saved, more, and, was, therefore, a, mild, form, of, robbery, given, an, equal, tax, rate, regardless, of, income, mill, agreed, that, inheritance, should, be, taxed, a, utilitarian, society, would, agree, that, everyone, should, be, equal, one, way, or, another, therefore, receiving, inheritance, would, put, one, ahead, of, society, unless, taxed, on, the, inheritance, those, who, donate, should, consider, and, choose, carefully, where, their, money, goes, some, charities, are, more, deserving, than, others, considering, public, charities, boards, such, as, a, government, will, disburse, the, money, equally, however, a, private, charity, board, like, a, church, would, disburse, the, monies, fairly, to, those, who, are, in, more, need, than, others, later, he, altered, his, views, toward, a, more, socialist, bent, adding, chapters, to, his, principles, of, political, economy, in, defence, of, a, socialist, outlook, and, defending, some, socialist, causes, within, this, revised, work, he, also, made, the, radical, proposal, that, the, whole, wage, system, be, abolished, in, favour, of, a, co, operative, wage, system, nonetheless, some, of, his, views, on, the, idea, of, flat, taxation, remained, albeit, altered, in, the, third, edition, of, the, principles, of, political, economy, to, reflect, a, concern, for, differentiating, restrictions, on, unearned, incomes, which, he, favoured, and, those, on, earned, incomes, which, he, did, not, favour, in, his, autobiography, mill, stated, that, in, relation, to, his, later, views, on, political, economy, his, ideal, of, ultimate, improvement, would, class, decidedly, under, the, general, designation, of, socialists, his, views, shifted, partly, due, to, reading, the, works, of, utopian, socialists, but, also, from, the, influence, of, harriet, taylor, in, his, work, socialism, mill, argued, that, the, prevalence, of, poverty, in, contemporary, industrial, capitalist, societies, was, pro, tanto, a, failure, of, the, social, arrangements, and, that, attempts, to, condone, this, state, of, affairs, as, being, the, result, of, individual, failings, did, not, represent, a, justification, of, them, but, instead, were, an, irresistible, claim, upon, every, human, being, for, protection, against, suffering, mill, s, principles, first, published, in, 1848, was, one, of, the, most, widely, read, of, all, books, on, economics, in, the, period, as, adam, smith, s, wealth, of, nations, had, during, an, earlier, period, principles, came, to, dominate, economics, teaching, in, the, case, of, oxford, university, it, was, the, standard, text, until, 1919, when, it, was, replaced, by, marshall, s, principles, of, economics, karl, marx, in, his, critique, of, political, economy, mentioned, mill, in, the, grundrisse, marx, contended, that, mill, s, thinking, posited, the, categories, of, capital, in, an, ahistorical, fashion, mill, s, main, objection, to, socialism, focused, on, what, he, saw, as, its, destruction, of, competition, he, wrote, hile, i, agree, and, sympathize, with, socialists, in, this, practical, portion, of, their, aims, i, utterly, dissent, from, the, most, conspicuous, and, vehement, part, of, their, teaching, their, declamations, against, competition, though, he, was, an, egalitarian, mill, argued, more, for, equal, opportunity, and, placed, meritocracy, above, all, other, ideals, in, this, regard, he, further, argued, that, a, socialist, society, would, only, be, attainable, through, the, provision, of, basic, education, for, all, promoting, economic, democracy, instead, of, capitalism, in, the, manner, of, substituting, capitalist, businesses, with, worker, cooperatives, he, says, the, form, of, association, however, which, if, mankind, continue, to, improve, must, be, expected, in, the, end, to, predominate, is, not, that, which, can, exist, between, a, capitalist, as, chief, and, work, people, without, a, voice, in, the, management, but, the, association, of, the, labourers, themselves, on, terms, of, equality, collectively, owning, the, capital, with, which, they, carry, on, their, operations, and, working, under, managers, elected, and, removable, by, themselves, mill, s, major, work, on, political, democracy, considerations, on, representative, government, defends, two, fundamental, principles, extensive, participation, by, citizens, and, enlightened, competence, of, rulers, the, two, values, are, obviously, in, tension, and, some, readers, have, concluded, that, he, is, an, elitist, democrat, while, others, count, him, as, an, earlier, participatory, democrat, in, one, section, he, appears, to, defend, a, type, of, plural, voting, where, more, competent, citizens, are, given, extra, votes, a, view, he, later, repudiated, however, in, another, chapter, he, argues, cogently, for, the, value, of, participation, by, all, citizens, he, believed, that, the, incompetence, of, the, masses, could, eventually, be, overcome, if, they, were, given, a, chance, to, take, part, in, politics, especially, at, the, local, level, mill, is, one, of, the, few, political, philosophers, ever, to, serve, in, government, as, an, elected, official, in, his, three, years, in, parliament, he, was, more, willing, to, compromise, than, the, radical, principles, expressed, in, his, writing, would, lead, one, to, expect, mill, was, a, major, proponent, of, the, diffusion, and, use, of, public, education, to, the, working, class, he, saw, the, value, of, the, individual, person, and, believed, that, man, had, the, inherent, capability, of, guiding, his, own, destiny, but, only, if, his, faculties, were, developed, and, fulfilled, which, could, be, achieved, through, education, he, regarded, education, as, a, pathway, to, improve, human, nature, which, to, him, meant, to, encourage, among, other, characteristics, diversity, and, originality, the, energy, of, character, initiative, autonomy, intellectual, cultivation, aesthetic, sensibility, non, self, regarding, interests, prudence, responsibility, and, self, control, education, allowed, for, humans, to, develop, into, full, informed, citizens, that, had, the, tools, to, improve, their, condition, and, make, fully, informed, electoral, decisions, the, power, of, education, lay, in, its, ability, to, serve, as, a, great, equalizer, among, the, classes, allowing, the, working, class, the, ability, to, control, their, own, destiny, and, compete, with, the, upper, classes, mill, recognised, the, paramount, importance, of, public, education, in, avoiding, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, by, ensuring, that, all, the, voters, and, political, participants, were, fully, developed, individuals, it, was, through, education, he, believed, that, an, individual, could, become, a, full, participant, within, representative, democracy, in, regards, to, higher, education, mill, defended, liberal, education, against, contemporary, arguments, for, models, of, higher, education, focused, on, religion, or, science, his, 1867, st, andrews, address, called, on, elites, educated, in, reformed, universities, to, work, towards, education, policy, committed, to, liberal, principles, in, principles, of, political, economy, mill, offered, an, analysis, of, two, economic, phenomena, often, linked, together, the, laws, of, production, and, wealth, and, the, modes, of, its, distribution, regarding, the, former, he, believed, that, it, was, not, possible, to, alter, to, laws, of, production, the, ultimate, properties, of, matter, and, mind, only, to, employ, these, properties, to, bring, about, events, we, are, interested, the, modes, of, distribution, of, wealth, is, a, matter, of, human, institutions, solely, starting, with, what, mill, believed, to, be, the, primary, and, fundamental, institution, individual, property, he, believed, that, all, individuals, must, start, on, equal, terms, with, division, of, the, instruments, of, production, fairly, among, all, members, of, society, once, each, member, has, an, equal, amount, of, individual, property, they, must, be, left, to, their, own, exertion, not, to, be, interfered, with, by, the, state, regarding, inequality, of, wealth, mill, believed, that, it, was, the, role, of, the, government, to, establish, both, social, and, economic, policies, that, promote, the, equality, of, opportunity, the, government, according, to, mill, should, implement, three, tax, policies, to, help, alleviate, poverty, inheritance, of, capital, and, wealth, plays, a, large, role, in, development, of, inequality, because, it, provides, greater, opportunity, for, those, receiving, the, inheritance, mill, s, solution, to, inequality, of, wealth, brought, about, by, inheritance, was, to, implement, a, greater, tax, on, inheritances, because, he, believed, the, most, important, authoritative, function, of, the, government, is, taxation, and, taxation, judiciously, implemented, could, promote, equality, in, book, iv, chapter, vi, of, principles, of, political, economy, of, the, stationary, state, mill, recognised, wealth, beyond, the, material, and, argued, that, the, logical, conclusion, of, unlimited, growth, was, destruction, of, the, environment, and, a, reduced, quality, of, life, he, concluded, that, a, stationary, state, could, be, preferable, to, unending, economic, growth, i, cannot, therefore, regard, the, stationary, states, of, capital, and, wealth, with, the, unaffected, aversion, so, generally, manifested, towards, it, by, political, economists, of, the, old, school, if, the, earth, must, lose, that, great, portion, of, its, pleasantness, which, it, owes, to, things, that, the, unlimited, increase, of, wealth, and, population, would, extirpate, from, it, for, the, mere, purpose, of, enabling, it, to, support, a, larger, but, not, a, better, or, a, happier, population, i, sincerely, hope, for, the, sake, of, posterity, that, they, will, be, content, to, be, stationary, long, before, necessity, compel, them, to, it, according, to, mill, the, ultimate, tendency, in, an, economy, is, for, the, rate, of, profit, to, decline, due, to, diminishing, returns, in, agriculture, and, increase, in, population, at, a, malthusian, rate
