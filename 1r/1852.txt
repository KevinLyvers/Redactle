than, any, chess, championship, before, or, since, in, 1975, fischer, refused, to, defend, his, title, when, an, agreement, could, not, be, reached, with, fide, chess, s, international, governing,

though, occasional, reports, of, erratic, behavior, emerged, in, 1992, he, reemerged, to, win, an, unofficial, rematch, against, spassky, it, was, held, in, yugoslavia, which, was, under, a, united, nations, embargo, at, the, time, his, participation, led, to, a, conflict, with, the, us, government, which, warned, fischer, that, his, participation, in, the, match, would, violate, an, executive,

regarded, as, essential, reading, in, chess, literature, in, the, 1990s, he, patented, a, modified, chess, timing, system, that, added, a, time, increment, after, each, move, now, a, standard, practice, in, top, tournament, and, match, play, he, also, invented, fischer, random, chess, also, known, as, chess960, a, chess, variant, in, which, the, initial, position, of, the, pieces, is, randomized, to, one, of, 960, possible, positions, fischer, made, numerous, antisemitic, statements, including, holocaust, denial, his, antisemitism, was, a, major, theme, in, his, public, and, private, remarks, and, there, has, been, widespread, comment, and, speculation, concerning, his, psychological, condition, based, on, his, extreme, views, and, eccentric, behavior, bobby, fischer, was, born, at, michael, reese, hospital, in, chicago, illinois, on, march, 9, 1943, his, mother, regina, wender, fischer, was, a, us, citizen, born, in, switzerland, her, parents, were, polish, jews,

brooklyn, new, york, city, where, she, studied, for, her, master, s, degree, in, nursing, and, subsequently, began, working, in, that, field, in, 2002, peter, nicholas, and, clea, benson, of, the, philadelphia, inquirer, published, an, investigative, report, which, stated, that, bobby, fischer, s, biological, father, was, actually, paul, nem, nyi, nem, nyi, a, hungarian, mathematician, and, physicist, of, jewish, heritage, specialized, in, continuum, mechanics, his, work, applied, geometrical, solutions, to, fluid, dynamics, like, bobby, he, was, a, child, prodigy, and, won, the, hungarian, national, mathematics, competition, at, the, age, of, 17, benson, and, nicholas, continued, their, work, and, gathered, additional, evidence, in, court, records, personal, interviews, and, a, summary, of, an, fbi, investigation, written, by, j, edgar, hoover, which, confirmed, their, earlier, conclusions, throughout, the, 1950s, the, fbi, investigated, regina, and, her, circle, due, to, her, supposed, communist, views, and, due, to, her, time, living, in, moscow, fbi, files, note, that, hans, gerhardt, fischer, never, entered, the, united, states, while, recording, that, nem, nyi, took, a, keen, interest, in, fischer, s, upbringing, not, only, were, regina, and, nem, nyi, reported, to, have, had, an, affair, in, 1942, but, nem, nyi, made, monthly, child, support, payments, to, regina, and, paid, for, bobby, s, schooling, until, paul, nem, nyi, s, death, in, 1952, in, march, 1949, six, year, old, bobby, and, his, sister, joan, learned, how, to, play, chess, using, the, instructions, from, a, set, bought, at, a, candy, store, when, joan, lost, interest, in, chess, and, regina, did, not, have, time, to, play, fischer, was, left, to, play, many, of, his, first, games, against, himself, when, the, family, vacationed, at, patchogue, long, island, new, york, that, summer, bobby, found, a, book, of, old, chess, games, and, studied, it, intensely, in, 1950, the, family, moved, to, brooklyn, first, to, an, apartment, at, the, corner, of, union, street, and, franklin, avenue, and, later, to, a, two, bedroom, apartment, at, 560, lincoln, place, it, was, there, that, fischer, soon, became, so, engrossed, in, the, game, that, regina, feared, he, was, spending, too, much, time, alone, as, a, result, on, november, 14, 1950, regina, sent, a, postcard, to, the, brooklyn, eagle, newspaper, seeking, to, place, an, ad, inquiring, whether, other, children, of, bobby, s, age, might, be, interested, in, playing, chess, with, him, the, paper, rejected, her, ad, because, no, one, could, figure, out, how, to, classify, it, but, forwarded, her, inquiry, to, hermann, helms, the, dean, of, american, chess, who, told, her, that, master, max, pavey, former, scottish, champion, would, be, giving, a, simultaneous, exhibition, on, january, 17, 1951, fischer, played, in, the, exhibition, although, he, held, on, for, 15, minutes, drawing, a, crowd, of, onlookers, he, eventually, lost, to, the, chess, master, one, of, the, spectators, was, brooklyn, chess, club, president, carmine, nigro, an, american, chess, expert, of, near, master, strength, and, an, instructor, nigro, was, so, impressed, with, fischer, s, play, that, he, introduced, him, to, the, club, and, began, teaching, him, fischer, noted, of, his, time, with, nigro, mr, nigro, was, possibly, not, the, best, player, in, the, world, but, he, was, a, very, good, teacher, meeting, him, was, probably, a, decisive, factor, in, my, going, ahead, with, chess, nigro, hosted, fischer, s, first, chess, tournament, at, his, home, in, 1952, in, the, summer, of, 1955, fischer, then, 12, years, old, joined, the, manhattan, chess, club, fischer, s, relationship, with, nigro, lasted, until, 1956, when, nigro, moved, away, in, june, 1956, fischer, began, attending, the, hawthorne, chess, club, based, in, master, john, jack, w, collins, s, home, collins, taught, chess, to, children, and, has, been, described, as, fischer, s, teacher, but, collins, himself, suggested, that, he, did, not, actually, teach, fischer, and, the, relationship, might, be, more, accurately, described, as, one, of, mentorship, fischer, played, thousands, of, blitz, and, offhand, games, with, collins, and, other, strong, players, studied, the, books, in, collins, large, chess, library, and, ate, almost, as, many, dinners, at, collins, home, as, his, own, in, march, 1956, the, log, cabin, chess, club, of, west, orange, new, jersey, based, in, the, home, of, the, club, s, eccentric, multi, millionaire, founder, and, patron, elliott, forry, laucks, took, fischer, on, a, tour, to, cuba, where, he, gave, a, 12, board, simultaneous, exhibition, at, havana, s, capablanca, chess, club, winning, ten, games, and, drawing, two, on, this, tour, the, club, played, a, series, of, matches, against, other, clubs, fischer, played, second, board, behind, international, master, norman, whitaker, whitaker, and, fischer, were, the, club, s, leading, scorers, each, scoring, 5, points, out, of, 7, games, fischer, experienced, a, meteoric, rise, in, his, playing, strength, during, 1956, on, the, tenth, national, rating, list, of, the, united, states, chess, federation, uscf, published, on, may, 20, 1956, his, rating, was, a, modest, 1726, over, 900, points, below, top, rated, samuel, reshevsky, 2663, fischer, s, first, real, tournament, success, occurred, in, july, 1956, when, he, won, the, us, junior, chess, championship, in, philadelphia, he, scored, 8, 10, to, become, the, youngest, ever, junior, champion, at, age, 13, a, record, that, still, stands, at, the, 1956, us, open, chess, championship, in, oklahoma, city, he, scored, 8, 12, to, tie, for, 4th, 8th, places, with, arthur, bisguier, winning, in, the, first, canadian, open, chess, championship, at, montreal, 1956, he, scored, 7, 10, to, tie, for, 8th, 12th, places, with, larry, evans, winning, in, november, fischer, played, in, the, 1956, eastern, states, open, championship, in, washington, d, c, tying, for, second, with, william, lombardy, nicholas, rossolimo, and, arthur, feuerstein, with, hans, berliner, taking, first, by, a, half, point, fischer, accepted, an, invitation, to, play, in, the, third, lessing, j, rosenwald, trophy, tournament, in, new, york, city, in, october, 1956, a, premier, tournament, limited, to, the, 12, players, considered, the, best, in, the, us, playing, against, top, opposition, the, 13, year, old, fischer, could, only, score, 4, 11, tying, for, 8th, 9th, place, yet, he, won, the, brilliancy, prize, for, his, game, against, international, master, donald, byrne, in, which, fischer, sacrificed, his, queen, to, unleash, an, unstoppable, attack, hans, kmoch, called, it, the, game, of, the, century, writing, the, following, game, a, stunning, masterpiece, of, combination, play, performed, by, a, boy, of, 13, against, a, formidable, opponent, matches, the, finest, on, record, in, the, history, of, chess, prodigies, according, to, frank, brady, the, game, of, the, century, has, been, talked, about, analyzed, and, admired, for, more, than, fifty, years, and, it, will, probably, be, a, part, of, the, canon, of, chess, for, many, years, to, come, in, reflecting, on, his, game, a, while, after, it, occurred, bobby, was, refreshingly, modest, i, just, made, the, moves, i, thought, were, best, i, was, just, lucky, in, 1957, fischer, played, a, two, game, match, against, former, world, champion, max, euwe, at, new, york, losing, 1, when, the, us, chess, federation, published, its, rating, list, in, may, fischer, had, the, rank, of, master, the, youngest, player, to, earn, that, title, up, to, that, point, in, july, he, successfully, defended, his, us, junior, title, scoring, 8, 9, at, san, francisco, in, august, he, scored, 10, 12, at, the, us, open, chess, championship, in, cleveland, winning, on, tie, breaking, points, over, arthur, bisguier, this, made, fischer, the, youngest, ever, us, open, champion, he, won, the, new, jersey, open, championship, scoring, 6, 7, he, then, defeated, the, young, filipino, master, rodolfo, tan, cardoso, 6, 2, in, a, new, york, match, sponsored, by, pepsi, cola, based, on, fischer, s, rating, and, strong, results, the, uscf, invited, him, to, play, in, the, 1957, 58, us, championship, the, tournament, included, six, time, us, champion, samuel, reshevsky, defending, us, champion, arthur, bisguier, and, william, lombardy, who, in, august, had, won, the, world, junior, championship, bisguier, predicted, that, fischer, would, finish, slightly, over, the, center, mark, despite, all, the, predictions, to, the, contrary, fischer, scored, eight, wins, and, five, draws, to, win, the, tournament, by, a, one, point, margin, with, 10, 13, still, two, months, shy, of, his, 15th, birthday, fischer, became, the, youngest, ever, us, champion, since, the, championship, that, year, was, also, the, us, zonal, championship, fischer, s, victory, earned, him, the, title, of, international, master, fischer, s, victory, in, the, us, championship, qualified, him, to, participate, in, the, 1958, portoro, interzonal, the, next, step, toward, challenging, the, world, champion, in, 1957, fischer, wanted, to, go, to, moscow, at, his, pleading, regina, wrote, directly, to, the, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, requesting, an, invitation, for, fischer, to, participate, in, the, 6th, world, youth, and, student, festival, of, 1957, the, reply, affirmative, came, too, late, for, him, to, go, regina, did, not, have, the, money, to, pay, the, airfare, but, in, 1958, fischer, was, invited, onto, the, game, show, i, ve, got, a, secret, where, thanks, to, regina, s, efforts, the, producers, of, the, show, arranged, two, round, trip, tickets, to, the, soviet, union, for, bobby, and, his, sister, joan, once, in, russia, fischer, was, invited, by, the, soviet, union, to, moscow, where, international, master, lev, abramov, would, serve, as, a, guide, to, bobby, and, his, sister, joan, upon, arrival, fischer, immediately, demanded, that, he, be, taken, to, the, moscow, central, chess, club, where, he, played, speed, chess, with, two, young, soviet, masters, evgeni, vasiukov, and, alexander, nikitin, winning, every, game, chess, author, v, i, linder, writes, about, the, impression, fischer, gave, grandmaster, gm, vladimir, alatortsev, when, he, played, blitz, against, the, soviet, masters, back, in, 1958, in, the, central, chess, club, vladimir, alatortsev, saw, a, tall, angular, 15, year, old, youth, who, in, blitz, games, crushed, almost, everyone, who, crossed, his, path, alatortsev, was, no, exception, losing, all, three, games, he, was, astonished, by, the, young, american, robert, fischer, s, play, his, fantastic, self, confidence, amazing, chess, erudition, and, simply, brilliant, play, vladimir, said, in, admiration, to, his, wife, on, arriving, home, this, is, the, future, world, champion, fischer, demanded, to, play, against, mikhail, botvinnik, the, reigning, world, champion, when, told, that, this, was, impossible, fischer, asked, to, play, paul, keres, finally, tigran, petrosian, was, on, a, semi, official, basis, summoned, to, the, club, where, he, played, speed, games, with, fischer, winning, the, majority, when, bobby, discovered, that, he, wasn, t, going, to, play, any, formal, games, he, went, into, a, not, so, silent, rage, saying, he, was, fed, up, with, these, russian, pigs, which, angered, the, soviets, who, saw, fischer, as, their, honored, guest, it, was, then, that, the, yugoslavian, chess, officials, offered, to, take, in, fischer, and, joan, as, early, guests, to, the, interzonal, fischer, took, them, up, on, the, offer, arriving, in, yugoslavia, to, play, two, short, training, matches, against, masters, dragoljub, jano, evi, and, milan, matulovi, fischer, drew, both, games, against, jano, evi, and, then, defeated, matulovi, in, belgrade, by, 2, 1, at, portoro, fischer, was, accompanied, by, lombardy, the, top, six, finishers, in, the, interzonal, would, qualify, for, the, candidates, tournament, most, observers, doubted, that, a, 15, year, old, with, no, international, experience, could, finish, among, the, six, qualifiers, at, the, interzonal, but, fischer, told, journalist, miro, radoicic, i, can, draw, with, the, grandmasters, and, there, are, half, a, dozen, patzers, in, the, tournament, i, reckon, to, beat, despite, some, bumps, in, the, road, and, a, problematic, start, fischer, succeeded, in, his, plan, after, a, strong, finish, he, ended, up, with, 12, 20, 6, 2, 12, to, tie, for, 5th, 6th, the, soviet, gm, yuri, averbakh, observed, in, the, struggle, at, the, board, this, youth, almost, still, a, child, showed, himself, to, be, a, full, fledged, fighter, demonstrating, amazing, composure, precise, calculation, and, devilish, resourcefulness, i, was, especially, struck, not, even, by, his, extensive, opening, knowledge, but, his, striving, everywhere, to, seek, new, paths, in, fischer, s, play, an, enormous, talent, was, noticeable, and, in, addition, one, sensed, an, enormous, amount, of, work, on, the, study, of, chess, soviet, gm, david, bronstein, said, of, fischer, s, time, in, portoro, it, was, interesting, for, me, to, observe, fischer, but, for, a, long, time, i, couldn, t, understand, why, this, 15, year, old, boy, played, chess, so, well, fischer, became, the, youngest, person, ever, to, qualify, for, the, candidates, and, the, youngest, ever, grandmaster, at, the, time, aged, 15, years, 6, months, 1, day, by, then, everyone, knew, we, had, a, genius, on, our, hands, before, the, candidates, tournament, fischer, won, the, 1958, 59, us, championship, scoring, 8, 11, he, tied, for, third, with, borislav, ivkov, in, mar, del, plata, scoring, 10, 14, a, half, point, behind, lud, k, pachman, and, miguel, najdorf, he, tied, for, 4th, 6th, at, santiago, scoring, 7, 12, behind, ivkov, pachman, and, herman, pilnik, at, the, z, rich, international, tournament, spring, 1959, fischer, finished, a, point, behind, future, world, champion, mikhail, tal, and, a, half, point, behind, yugoslavian, gm, svetozar, gligori, although, fischer, had, ended, his, formal, education, at, age, 16, dropping, out, of, erasmus, hall, high, school, in, brooklyn, he, subsequently, taught, himself, several, foreign, languages, including, russian, so, he, could, read, foreign, chess, periodicals, according, to, latvian, chess, master, alexander, koblencs, even, he, and, tal, could, not, match, the, commitment, that, fischer, had, made, to, chess, recalling, a, conversation, from, the, tournament, tell, me, bobby, tal, continued, what, do, you, think, of, the, playing, style, of, larissa, volpert, she, s, too, cautious, but, you, have, another, girl, dmitrieva, her, games, do, appeal, to, me, here, we, were, left, literally, open, mouthed, in, astonishment, misha, and, i, have, looked, at, thousands, of, games, but, it, never, occurred, to, us, to, study, our, women, players, games, how, could, we, find, the, time, for, this, yet, bobby, it, turns, out, had, found, the, time, until, late, 1959, fischer, had, dressed, atrociously, for, a, champion, appearing, at, the, most, august, and, distinguished, national, and, international, events, in, sweaters, and, corduroys, now, encouraged, by, pal, benko, to, dress, more, smartly, fischer, began, buying, suits, from, all, over, the, world, hand, tailored, and, made, to, order, he, told, journalist, ralph, ginzburg, that, he, had, 17, hand, tailored, suits, and, that, all, of, his, shirts, and, shoes, were, handmade, at, the, age, of, 16, fischer, finished, equal, fifth, out, of, eight, at, the, 1959, candidates, tournament, in, bled, zagreb, belgrade, yugoslavia, scoring, 12, 28, he, was, outclassed, by, tournament, winner, tal, who, won, all, four, of, their, individual, games, that, year, fischer, released, his, first, book, of, collected, games, bobby, fischer, s, games, of, chess, published, by, simon, schuster, fischer, s, interest, in, chess, became, more, important, than, schoolwork, to, the, point, that, by, the, time, he, reached, the, fourth, grade, he, d, been, in, and, out, of, six, schools, in, 1952, regina, got, bobby, a, scholarship, based, on, his, chess, talent, and, astronomically, high, iq, to, brooklyn, community, woodward, fischer, later, attended, erasmus, hall, high, school, at, the, same, time, as, barbra, streisand, and, neil, diamond, in, 1959, its, student, council, awarded, him, a, gold, medal, for, his, chess, achievements, the, same, year, fischer, dropped, out, of, high, school, when, he, turned, 16, the, earliest, he, could, legally, do, so, he, later, explained, to, ralph, ginzburg, you, don, t, learn, anything, in, school, when, fischer, was, 16, his, mother, moved, out, of, their, apartment, to, pursue, medical, training, her, friend, joan, rodker, who, had, met, regina, when, the, two, were, idealistic, communists, living, in, moscow, in, the, 1930s, believes, that, fischer, resented, his, mother, for, being, mostly, absent, a, communist, activist, and, an, admirer, of, the, soviet, union, and, that, this, led, to, his, hatred, for, the, soviets, in, letters, to, rodker, fischer, s, mother, stated, her, desire, to, pursue, her, own, obsession, of, training, in, medicine, and, wrote, that, her, son, would, have, to, live, in, their, brooklyn, apartment, without, her, it, sounds, terrible, to, leave, a, 16, year, old, to, his, own, devices, but, he, is, probably, happier, that, way, the, apartment, was, on, the, edge, of, bedford, stuyvesant, a, neighborhood, that, had, one, of, the, highest, homicide, and, general, crime, rates, in, new, york, city, despite, the, alienation, from, her, son, regina, in, 1960, protested, the, practices, of, the, american, chess, foundation, and, staged, a, five, hour, protest, in, front, of, the, white, house, urging, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, to, send, an, american, team, to, that, year, s, chess, olympiad, set, for, leipzig, east, germany, behind, the, iron, curtain, and, to, help, support, the, team, financially, fischer, played, in, eight, us, championships, winning, all, of, them, by, at, least, a, one, point, margin, his, results, were, as, follows, fischer, missed, the, 1961, 62, championship, he, was, preparing, for, the, 1962, interzonal, and, there, was, no, 1964, 65, event, in, his, eight, us, chess, championships, fischer, lost, only, three, games, to, edmar, mednis, in, the, 1962, 63, event, and, in, consecutive, rounds, to, samuel, reshevsky, and, robert, byrne, in, the, 1965, championship, culminating, in, a, total, score, of, 74, 90, 61, wins, 26, draws, 3, losses, fischer, refused, to, play, in, the, 1958, munich, olympiad, when, his, demand, to, play, first, board, ahead, of, samuel, reshevsky, was, rejected, some, sources, claim, that, 15, year, old, fischer, was, unable, to, arrange, leave, from, attending, high, school, fischer, later, represented, the, united, states, on, first, board, at, four, men, s, chess, olympiads, winning, two, individual, silver, and, one, individual, bronze, medals, out, of, four, men, s, chess, olympiads, fischer, scored, 40, 7, 18, for, 49, 65, 75, 4, in, 1966, fischer, narrowly, missed, the, individual, gold, medal, scoring, 88, 23, to, world, champion, tigran, petrosian, s, 88, 46, he, played, four, games, more, than, petrosian, faced, stiffer, opposition, and, would, have, won, the, gold, if, he, had, accepted, florin, gheorghiu, s, draw, offer, rather, than, declining, it, and, suffering, his, only, loss, at, the, 1962, varna, olympiad, fischer, predicted, that, he, would, defeat, argentinian, gm, miguel, najdorf, in, 25, moves, fischer, actually, did, it, in, 24, becoming, the, only, player, to, beat, najdorf, in, the, tournament, najdorf, lost, the, game, while, employing, the, very, opening, variation, named, after, him, the, sicilian, najdorf, fischer, had, planned, to, play, for, the, us, at, the, 1968, lugano, olympiad, but, backed, out, when, he, saw, the, poor, playing, conditions, both, former, world, champion, tigran, petrosian, and, belgian, american, international, master, george, koltanowski, the, leader, of, the, american, team, that, year, felt, that, fischer, was, justified, in, not, participating, in, the, olympiad, according, to, lombardy, fischer, s, non, participation, was, due, to, reshevsky, s, refusal, to, yield, first, board, in, 1974, fischer, was, willing, to, play, the, 21st, chess, olympiad, in, nice, france, but, fide, rejected, his, demand, to, play, in, a, separate, room, with, only, fischer, his, opponent, and, spectators, in, 1960, fischer, tied, for, first, place, with, soviet, star, boris, spassky, at, the, strong, mar, del, plata, tournament, in, argentina, winning, by, a, two, point, margin, scoring, 13, 15, 13, 1, 1, ahead, of, david, bronstein, fischer, lost, only, to, spassky, this, was, the, start, of, their, lifelong, friendship, and, rivalry, fischer, experienced, a, rare, failure, in, his, competitive, career, at, the, buenos, aires, tournament, 1960, finishing, with, 8, 19, 3, 5, 11, far, behind, winners, viktor, korchnoi, and, samuel, reshevsky, with, 13, 19, according, to, larry, evans, fischer, s, first, sexual, experience, was, with, a, girl, to, whom, evans, introduced, him, during, the, tournament, pal, benko, said, that, fischer, did, horribly, in, the, tournament, because, he, got, caught, up, in, women, and, sex, afterwards, fischer, said, he, d, never, mix, women, and, chess, together, and, kept, the, promise, fischer, concluded, 1960, by, winning, a, small, tournament, in, reykjav, k, with, 4, 5, and, defeating, klaus, darga, in, an, exhibition, game, in, west, berlin, in, 1961, fischer, started, a, 16, game, match, with, reshevsky, split, between, new, york, and, los, angeles, reshevsky, 32, years, fischer, s, senior, was, considered, the, favorite, since, he, had, far, more, match, experience, and, had, never, lost, a, set, match, after, 11, games, and, a, tie, score, two, wins, apiece, with, seven, draws, the, match, ended, prematurely, due, to, a, scheduling, dispute, between, fischer, and, match, organizer, and, sponsor, jacqueline, piatigorsky, fischer, forfeited, 2, games, and, even, though, the, score, was, now, 7, to, 5, with, 8, required, to, win, reshevsky, was, declared, the, winner, by, default, and, received, the, winner, s, share, of, the, prize, fund, fischer, was, second, in, a, super, class, field, behind, only, former, world, champion, tal, at, bled, 1961, yet, fischer, defeated, tal, head, to, head, for, the, first, time, in, their, individual, game, scored, 3, 4, against, the, soviet, contingent, and, finished, as, the, only, unbeaten, player, with, 13, 19, 8, 0, 11, fischer, won, the, 1962, stockholm, interzonal, by, a, 2, point, margin, going, undefeated, with, 17, 22, 13, 0, 9, he, was, the, first, non, soviet, player, to, win, an, interzonal, since, fide, instituted, the, tournament, in, 1948, russian, gm, alexander, kotov, said, of, fischer, i, have, discussed, fischer, s, play, with, max, euwe, and, gideon, stahlberg, all, of, us, experienced, tournament, old, timers, were, surprised, by, fischer, s, endgame, expertise, when, a, young, player, is, good, at, attacking, or, at, combinations, this, is, understandable, but, a, faultless, endgame, technique, at, the, age, of, 19, is, something, rare, i, can, recall, only, one, other, player, who, at, that, age, was, equally, skillful, at, endgames, vasily, smyslov, fischer, s, victory, made, him, a, favorite, for, the, candidates, tournament, in, cura, ao, yet, despite, his, result, in, the, interzonal, fischer, only, finished, fourth, out, of, eight, with, 14, 27, 8, 7, 12, far, behind, tigran, petrosian, 17, 27, efim, geller, and, paul, keres, both, 17, 27, tal, fell, very, ill, during, the, tournament, and, had, to, withdraw, before, completion, fischer, a, friend, of, tal, s, was, the, only, contestant, who, visited, him, in, the, hospital, following, his, failure, in, the, 1962, candidates, fischer, asserted, in, a, sports, illustrated, article, that, three, of, the, five, soviet, players, tigran, petrosian, paul, keres, and, efim, geller, had, a, prearranged, agreement, to, quickly, draw, their, games, against, each, other, in, order, to, conserve, their, energy, for, playing, against, fischer, it, is, generally, thought, that, this, accusation, is, correct, fischer, stated, that, he, would, never, again, participate, in, a, candidates, tournament, since, the, format, combined, with, the, alleged, collusion, made, it, impossible, for, a, non, soviet, player, to, win, following, fischer, s, article, fide, in, late, 1962, voted, to, implement, a, radical, reform, of, the, playoff, system, replacing, the, candidates, tournament, with, a, format, of, one, on, one, knockout, matches, the, format, that, fischer, would, dominate, in, 1971, fischer, defeated, bent, larsen, in, a, summer, 1962, exhibition, game, in, copenhagen, for, danish, tv, later, that, year, fischer, beat, bogdan, liwa, in, a, team, match, against, poland, in, warsaw, in, the, 1962, 63, us, championship, fischer, lost, to, edmar, mednis, in, round, one, it, was, his, first, loss, ever, in, a, us, championship, bisguier, was, in, excellent, form, and, fischer, caught, up, to, him, only, at, the, end, tied, at, 7, 3, the, two, met, in, the, final, round, bisguier, stood, well, in, the, middlegame, but, blundered, handing, fischer, his, fifth, consecutive, us, championship, influenced, by, ill, will, over, the, aborted, 1961, match, against, reshevsky, fischer, declined, an, invitation, to, play, in, the, 1963, piatigorsky, cup, tournament, in, los, angeles, which, had, a, world, class, field, he, instead, played, in, the, western, open, in, bay, city, michigan, which, he, won, with, 7, 8, in, august, september, 1963, fischer, won, the, new, york, state, championship, at, poughkeepsie, with, 7, 7, his, first, perfect, score, ahead, of, arthur, bisguier, and, james, sherwin, in, the, 1963, 64, us, championship, fischer, achieved, his, second, perfect, score, this, time, against, the, top, ranked, chess, players, in, the, country, this, result, brought, fischer, heightened, fame, including, a, profile, in, life, magazine, sports, illustrated, diagrammed, each, of, the, 11, games, in, its, article, the, amazing, victory, streak, of, bobby, fischer, such, extensive, chess, coverage, was, groundbreaking, for, the, top, american, sports, magazine, his, 11, 0, win, in, the, 1963, 64, championship, is, the, only, perfect, score, in, the, history, of, the, tournament, and, one, of, about, ten, perfect, scores, in, high, level, chess, tournaments, ever, david, hooper, and, kenneth, whyld, called, it, the, most, remarkable, achievement, of, this, kind, fischer, recalls, motivated, by, my, lopsided, result, 11, 0, dr, kmoch, congratulated, evans, the, runner, up, on, winning, the, tournament, and, then, he, congratulated, me, on, winning, the, exhibition, fischer, s, 21, move, victory, against, robert, byrne, won, the, brilliancy, prize, for, the, tournament, byrne, wrote, the, culminating, combination, is, of, such, depth, that, even, at, the, very, moment, at, which, i, resigned, both, grandmasters, who, were, commenting, on, the, play, for, the, spectators, in, a, separate, room, believed, i, had, a, won, game, international, master, anthony, saidy, recalled, his, last, round, encounter, with, the, undefeated, fischer, going, into, the, final, game, i, certainly, did, not, expect, to, upset, fischer, i, hardly, knew, the, opening, but, played, simply, and, he, went, along, with, the, scenario, opting, for, a, n, v, b, endgame, with, a, minimal, edge, in, the, corridor, evans, said, to, me, good, show, him, we, re, not, all, children, at, adjournment, saidy, saw, a, way, to, force, a, draw, yet, he, had, already, sealed, a, different, wrong, move, and, lost, chess, publications, around, the, world, wrote, of, the, unparalleled, achievement, only, bent, larsen, always, a, fischer, detractor, was, unimpressed, fischer, was, playing, against, children, fischer, eligible, as, us, champion, decided, against, his, participation, in, the, 1964, amsterdam, interzonal, taking, himself, out, of, the, 1966, world, championship, cycle, even, after, fide, changed, the, format, of, the, eight, player, candidates, tournament, from, a, round, robin, to, a, series, of, knockout, matches, which, eliminated, the, possibility, of, collusion, instead, fischer, embarked, on, a, tour, of, the, united, states, and, canada, from, february, through, may, playing, a, simultaneous, exhibition, and, giving, a, lecture, in, each, of, more, than, 40, cities, he, had, a, 94, winning, percentage, over, more, than, 2, 000, games, fischer, declined, an, invitation, to, play, for, the, us, in, the, 1964, olympiad, in, tel, aviv, fischer, wanted, to, play, in, the, capablanca, memorial, tournament, in, havana, in, august, and, september, 1965, since, the, state, department, refused, to, endorse, fischer, s, passport, as, valid, for, visiting, cuba, he, proposed, and, the, tournament, officials, and, players, accepted, a, unique, arrangement, fischer, played, his, moves, from, a, room, at, the, marshall, chess, club, which, were, then, transmitted, by, teleprinter, to, cuba, lud, k, pachman, observed, that, fischer, was, handicapped, by, the, longer, playing, session, resulting, from, the, time, wasted, in, transmitting, the, moves, and, that, is, one, reason, why, he, lost, to, three, of, his, chief, rivals, the, tournament, was, an, ordeal, for, fischer, who, had, to, endure, eight, hour, and, sometimes, even, twelve, hour, playing, sessions, despite, the, handicap, fischer, tied, for, second, through, fourth, places, with, 15, 21, 12, 3, 6, behind, former, world, champion, vasily, smyslov, whom, fischer, defeated, in, their, individual, game, the, tournament, received, extensive, media, coverage, in, december, fischer, won, his, seventh, us, championship, 1965, with, the, score, of, 8, 11, 8, 2, 1, despite, losing, to, robert, byrne, and, reshevsky, in, the, eighth, and, ninth, rounds, fischer, also, reconciled, with, mrs, piatigorsky, accepting, an, invitation, to, the, very, strong, second, piatigorsky, cup, 1966, tournament, in, santa, monica, fischer, began, disastrously, and, after, eight, rounds, was, tied, for, last, with, 3, 8, he, then, staged, a, strong, comeback, scoring, 7, 8, in, the, next, eight, rounds, in, the, end, world, chess, championship, finalist, boris, spassky, edged, him, out, by, a, half, point, scoring, 11, 18, to, fischer, s, 11, 18, 7, 3, 8, now, aged, 23, fischer, would, win, every, match, or, tournament, he, completed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, fischer, won, the, us, championship, 1966, 67, for, the, eighth, and, final, time, ceding, only, three, draws, 8, 0, 3, in, march, april, and, august, september, fischer, won, strong, tournaments, at, monte, carlo, with, 7, 9, 6, 1, 2, and, skopje, with, 13, 17, 12, 2, 3, in, the, philippines, fischer, played, nine, exhibition, games, against, master, opponents, scoring, 8, 9, fischer, s, win, in, the, 1966, 67, us, championship, qualified, him, for, the, next, world, championship, cycle, at, the, 1967, interzonal, held, at, sousse, tunisia, fischer, scored, 8, points, in, the, first, 10, games, to, lead, the, field, his, observance, of, the, worldwide, church, of, god, s, seventh, day, sabbath, was, honored, by, the, organizers, but, deprived, fischer, of, several, rest, days, which, led, to, a, scheduling, dispute, causing, fischer, to, forfeit, two, games, in, protest, and, later, withdraw, eliminating, himself, from, the, 1969, world, championship, cycle, communications, difficulties, with, the, highly, inexperienced, local, organizers, were, also, a, significant, factor, since, fischer, knew, little, french, and, the, organizers, had, very, limited, english, no, one, in, tunisian, chess, had, previous, experience, running, an, event, of, this, stature, since, fischer, had, completed, fewer, than, half, of, his, scheduled, games, all, of, his, results, were, annulled, meaning, players, who, had, played, fischer, had, those, games, cancelled, and, the, scores, nullified, from, the, official, tournament, record, in, 1968, fischer, won, tournaments, at, netanya, with, 11, 13, 10, 0, 3, and, vinkovci, with, 11, 13, 9, 0, 4, by, large, margins, fischer, then, stopped, playing, for, the, next, 18, months, except, for, a, win, against, anthony, saidy, in, a, 1969, new, york, metropolitan, league, team, match, that, year, fischer, assisted, by, gm, larry, evans, released, his, second, book, of, collected, games, my, 60, memorable, games, published, by, simon, schuster, the, book, was, an, immediate, success, in, 1970, fischer, began, a, new, effort, to, become, world, champion, his, dramatic, march, toward, the, title, made, him, a, household, name, and, made, chess, front, page, news, for, a, time, he, won, the, title, in, 1972, but, forfeited, it, three, years, later, the, 1969, us, championship, was, also, a, zonal, qualifier, with, the, top, three, finishers, advancing, to, the, interzonal, fischer, however, had, sat, out, the, us, championship, because, of, disagreements, about, the, tournament, s, format, and, prize, fund, benko, one, of, the, three, qualifiers, agreed, to, give, up, his, spot, in, the, interzonal, to, give, fischer, another, shot, at, the, world, championship, lombardy, who, would, have, been, next, in, line, after, benko, did, the, same, in, 1970, and, 1971, fischer, dominated, his, contemporaries, to, an, extent, never, seen, before, or, since, before, the, interzonal, in, march, and, april, 1970, the, world, s, best, players, competed, in, the, ussr, vs, rest, of, the, world, match, in, belgrade, yugoslavia, often, referred, to, as, the, match, of, the, century, there, was, much, surprise, when, fischer, decided, to, participate, with, evans, as, his, second, fischer, flew, to, belgrade, with, the, intention, of, playing, first, board, for, the, rest, of, the, world, danish, gm, bent, larsen, however, due, to, his, recent, tournament, victories, demanded, to, play, first, board, instead, of, fischer, even, though, fischer, had, the, higher, elo, rating, to, the, surprise, of, everyone, fischer, agreed, although, the, ussr, team, eked, out, a, 20, 19, victory, on, the, top, four, boards, the, soviets, managed, to, win, only, one, game, out, of, a, possible, sixteen, bobby, fischer, was, the, high, scorer, for, his, team, with, a, 3, 1, score, against, petrosian, two, wins, and, two, draws, fischer, left, no, doubt, in, anyone, s, mind, that, he, had, put, his, temporary, break, from, the, tournament, circuit, to, good, use, petrosian, was, almost, unrecognizable, in, the, first, two, games, and, by, the, time, he, had, collected, himself, although, pressing, his, opponent, he, could, do, no, more, than, draw, the, last, two, games, of, the, four, game, set, after, the, ussr, versus, the, rest, of, the, world, match, the, unofficial, world, championship, of, lightning, chess, 5, minute, games, was, held, at, herceg, novi, figured, on, teaching, fischer, a, lesson, and, on, bringing, him, down, a, peg, or, two, petrosian, and, tal, were, considered, the, favorites, but, fischer, overwhelmed, the, super, class, field, with, 19, 22, 17, 1, 4, far, ahead, of, tal, 14, korchnoi, 14, petrosian, 13, and, bronstein, 13, fischer, lost, only, one, game, to, korchnoi, who, was, also, the, only, player, to, achieve, an, even, score, against, him, in, the, double, round, robin, tournament, fischer, crushed, such, blitz, kings, as, tal, petrosian, and, vasily, smyslov, by, a, clean, score, tal, marveled, that, during, the, entire, tournament, he, didn, t, leave, a, single, pawn, en, prise, while, the, other, players, blundered, knights, and, bishops, galore, for, lombardy, who, had, played, many, blitz, games, with, fischer, fischer, s, 4, point, margin, of, victory, came, as, a, pleasant, surprise, in, april, may, 1970, fischer, won, at, rovinj, zagreb, with, 13, 17, 10, 1, 6, by, a, two, point, margin, ahead, of, gligori, hort, korchnoi, smyslov, and, petrosian, in, july, august, fischer, crushed, the, mostly, grandmaster, field, at, buenos, aires, winning, by, a, 3, point, margin, scoring, 15, 17, 13, 0, 4, fischer, then, played, first, board, for, the, us, team, in, the, 19th, chess, olympiad, in, siegen, where, he, won, an, individual, silver, medal, scoring, 10, 13, 8, 1, 4, with, his, only, loss, being, to, world, champion, boris, spassky, right, after, the, olympiad, fischer, defeated, ulf, andersson, in, an, exhibition, game, for, the, swedish, newspaper, expressen, fischer, had, taken, his, game, to, a, new, level, fischer, won, the, interzonal, held, in, palma, de, mallorca, in, november, and, december, 1970, with, 18, 23, 15, 1, 7, far, ahead, of, larsen, efim, geller, and, robert, h, bner, with, 15, 23, fischer, finished, the, tournament, with, seven, consecutive, wins, setting, aside, the, sousse, interzonal, which, fischer, withdrew, from, while, leading, fischer, s, victory, gave, him, a, string, of, eight, consecutive, first, prizes, in, tournaments, former, world, champion, mikhail, botvinnik, was, not, however, impressed, by, fischer, s, results, stating, fischer, has, been, declared, a, genius, i, do, not, agree, with, this, in, order, to, rightly, be, declared, a, genius, in, chess, you, have, to, defeat, equal, opponents, by, a, big, margin, as, yet, he, has, not, done, this, despite, botvinnik, s, remarks, fischer, began, a, miraculous, year, in, the, history, of, chess, in, the, 1971, candidates, matches, fischer, was, set, to, play, against, soviet, grandmaster, and, concert, pianist, mark, taimanov, in, the, quarter, finals, the, match, began, in, mid, may, in, vancouver, british, columbia, canada, fischer, was, generally, favored, to, win, taimanov, had, reason, to, be, confident, he, was, backed, by, the, firm, guidance, of, botvinnik, who, had, thoroughly, analysed, fischer, s, record, and, put, together, a, dossier, on, him, from, when, he, was, in, talks, to, play, fischer, in, a, match, a, couple, of, years, earlier, after, fischer, defeated, taimanov, in, the, second, game, of, the, match, taimanov, asked, fischer, how, he, managed, to, come, up, with, the, move, 12, n1c3, to, which, fischer, replied, that, the, idea, was, not, his, he, had, come, across, it, in, the, monograph, by, the, soviet, master, alexander, nikitin, in, a, footnote, taimanov, said, of, this, it, is, staggering, that, i, an, expert, on, the, sicilian, should, have, missed, this, theoretically, significant, idea, by, my, compatriot, while, fischer, had, uncovered, it, in, a, book, in, a, foreign, language, with, the, score, at, 4, 0, in, fischer, s, favor, the, fifth, game, adjournment, was, a, sight, to, behold, schonberg, explains, the, scene, taimanov, came, to, vancouver, with, two, seconds, both, grandmasters, fischer, was, alone, he, thought, that, the, sight, of, taimanov, and, his, seconds, was, the, funniest, thing, he, had, ever, seen, there, taimanov, and, his, seconds, would, sit, six, hands, flying, pocket, sets, waving, in, the, air, while, variations, were, being, spouted, all, over, the, place, and, there, sat, taimanov, with, a, confused, look, on, his, face, just, before, resuming, play, the, seconds, were, giving, taimanov, some, last, minute, advice, when, poor, taimanov, entered, the, playing, room, and, sat, down, to, confront, fischer, his, head, was, so, full, of, conflicting, continuations, that, he, became, rattled, left, a, rook, en, prise, and, immediately, resigned, fischer, beat, taimanov, by, the, score, of, 6, 0, there, was, little, precedent, for, such, a, lopsided, score, in, a, match, leading, to, the, world, championship, upon, losing, the, final, game, of, the, match, taimanov, shrugged, his, shoulders, saying, sadly, to, fischer, well, i, still, have, my, music, as, a, result, of, his, performance, taimanov, was, thrown, out, of, the, ussr, team, and, forbidden, to, travel, for, two, years, he, was, banned, from, writing, articles, was, deprived, of, his, monthly, stipend, the, authorities, prohibited, him, from, performing, on, the, concert, platform, the, crushing, loss, virtually, ended, taimanov, s, chess, career, fischer, was, next, scheduled, to, play, against, danish, gm, bent, larsen, spassky, predicted, a, tight, struggle, larsen, is, a, little, stronger, in, spirit, before, the, match, botvinnik, had, told, a, soviet, television, audience, it, is, hard, to, say, how, their, match, will, end, but, it, is, clear, that, such, an, easy, victory, as, in, vancouver, will, not, be, given, to, fischer, i, think, larsen, has, unpleasant, surprises, in, store, for, all, the, more, since, having, dealt, with, taimanov, thus, fischer, will, want, to, do, just, the, same, to, larsen, and, this, is, impossible, fischer, beat, larsen, by, the, identical, score, of, 6, 0, robert, byrne, writes, to, a, certain, extent, i, could, grasp, the, taimanov, match, as, a, kind, of, curiosity, almost, a, freak, a, strange, chess, occurrence, that, would, never, occur, again, but, now, i, am, at, a, loss, for, anything, whatever, to, say, so, it, is, out, of, the, question, for, me, to, explain, how, bobby, how, anyone, could, win, six, games, in, a, row, from, such, a, genius, of, the, game, as, bent, larsen, just, a, year, before, larsen, had, played, first, board, for, the, rest, of, the, world, team, ahead, of, fischer, and, had, handed, fischer, his, only, loss, at, the, interzonal, garry, kasparov, later, wrote, that, no, player, had, ever, shown, a, superiority, over, his, rivals, comparable, to, fischer, s, incredible, 12, 0, score, in, the, two, matches, chess, statistician, jeff, sonas, concludes, that, the, victory, over, larsen, gave, fischer, the, highest, single, match, performance, rating, ever, on, august, 8, 1971, while, preparing, for, his, last, candidates, match, with, former, world, champion, tigran, petrosian, fischer, won, the, manhattan, chess, club, rapid, tournament, scoring, 21, 22, against, a, strong, field, despite, fischer, s, results, against, taimanov, and, larsen, his, upcoming, match, against, petrosian, seemed, a, daunting, task, nevertheless, the, soviet, government, was, concerned, about, fischer, reporters, asked, petrosian, whether, the, match, would, last, the, full, twelve, games, it, might, be, possible, that, i, win, it, earlier, petrosian, replied, and, then, stated, fischer, s, wins, do, not, impress, me, he, is, a, great, chess, player, but, no, genius, petrosian, played, a, strong, theoretical, novelty, in, the, first, game, gaining, the, advantage, but, fischer, eventually, won, the, game, after, petrosian, faltered, this, gave, fischer, a, run, of, 20, consecutive, wins, against, the, world, s, top, players, in, the, interzonal, and, candidates, matches, a, winning, streak, topped, only, by, steinitz, s, 25, straight, wins, in, 1873, 1882, petrosian, won, the, second, game, finally, snapping, fischer, s, streak, after, three, consecutive, draws, fischer, swept, the, next, four, games, to, win, the, match, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3, sports, illustrated, ran, an, article, on, the, match, highlighting, fischer, s, domination, of, petrosian, as, being, due, to, petrosian, s, outdated, system, of, preparation, fischer, s, recent, record, raises, the, distinct, possibility, that, he, has, made, a, breakthrough, in, modern, chess, theory, his, response, to, petrosian, s, elaborately, plotted, 11th, move, in, the, first, game, is, an, example, russian, experts, had, worked, on, the, variation, for, weeks, yet, when, it, was, thrown, at, fischer, suddenly, he, faced, its, consequences, alone, and, won, by, applying, simple, classic, principles, upon, completion, of, the, match, petrosian, remarked, after, the, sixth, game, fischer, really, did, become, a, genius, i, on, the, other, hand, either, had, a, breakdown, or, was, tired, or, something, else, happened, but, the, last, three, games, were, no, longer, chess, some, experts, kept, insisting, that, petrosian, was, off, form, and, that, he, should, have, had, a, plus, score, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, game, to, which, fischer, replied, people, have, been, playing, against, me, below, strength, for, fifteen, years, fischer, s, match, results, befuddled, botvinnik, it, is, hard, to, talk, about, fischer, s, matches, since, the, time, that, he, has, been, playing, them, miracles, have, begun, when, petrosian, played, like, petrosian, fischer, played, like, a, very, strong, grandmaster, but, when, petrosian, began, making, mistakes, fischer, was, transformed, into, a, genius, fischer, gained, a, far, higher, rating, than, any, player, in, history, up, to, that, time, on, the, july, 1972, fide, rating, list, his, elo, rating, of, 2785, was, 125, points, above, world, no, 2, spassky, s, rating, of, 2660, his, results, put, him, on, the, cover, of, life, magazine, and, allowed, him, to, challenge, world, champion, boris, spassky, whom, he, had, never, beaten, 0, 3, 2, fischer, s, career, long, stubbornness, about, match, and, tournament, conditions, was, again, seen, in, the, run, up, to, his, match, with, spassky, of, the, possible, sites, fischer, s, first, choice, was, belgrade, yugoslavia, while, spassky, s, was, reykjav, k, iceland, for, a, time, it, appeared, that, the, dispute, would, be, resolved, by, splitting, the, match, between, the, two, locations, but, that, arrangement, failed, after, that, issue, was, resolved, fischer, refused, to, appear, in, iceland, until, the, prize, fund, was, increased, london, financier, jim, slater, donated, an, additional, us, 125, 000, bringing, the, prize, fund, up, to, an, unprecedented, 250, 000, 1, 82, million, today, and, fischer, finally, agreed, to, play, before, and, during, the, match, fischer, paid, special, attention, to, his, physical, training, and, fitness, which, was, a, relatively, novel, approach, for, top, chess, players, at, that, time, leading, up, to, this, match, he, conducted, interviews, with, 60, minutes, and, dick, cavett, explaining, the, importance, of, physical, fitness, in, his, preparation, he, had, developed, his, tennis, skills, to, a, good, level, and, played, frequently, during, off, days, in, reykjav, k, he, had, also, arranged, for, exclusive, use, of, his, hotel, s, swimming, pool, during, specified, hours, and, swam, for, extended, periods, usually, late, at, night, according, to, soviet, grandmaster, nikolai, krogius, fischer, was, paying, great, attention, to, sport, and, that, he, was, swimming, and, even, boxing, the, match, took, place, in, reykjav, k, from, july, to, september, 1972, fischer, was, accompanied, by, william, lombardy, besides, assisting, with, analysis, lombardy, may, have, played, an, important, role, in, getting, fischer, to, play, in, the, match, and, to, stay, in, it, the, match, was, the, first, to, receive, an, american, broadcast, in, prime, time, fischer, lost, the, first, two, games, in, strange, fashion, the, first, when, he, played, a, risky, pawn, grab, in, a, drawn, endgame, the, second, by, forfeit, when, he, refused, to, play, the, game, in, a, dispute, over, playing, conditions, fischer, would, likely, have, forfeited, the, entire, match, but, spassky, not, wanting, to, win, by, default, yielded, to, fischer, s, demands, to, move, the, next, game, to, a, back, room, away, from, the, cameras, whose, presence, had, upset, fischer, after, that, game, the, match, was, moved, back, to, the, stage, and, proceeded, without, further, serious, incident, fischer, won, seven, of, the, next, 19, games, losing, only, one, and, drawing, eleven, to, win, the, match, 12, 8, and, become, the, 11th, world, chess, champion, the, cold, war, trappings, made, the, match, a, media, sensation, it, was, called, the, match, of, the, century, and, received, front, page, media, coverage, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, fischer, s, win, was, an, american, victory, in, a, field, that, soviet, players, closely, identified, with, and, subsidized, by, the, state, had, dominated, for, the, previous, quarter, century, kasparov, remarked, fischer, fits, ideologically, into, the, context, of, the, cold, war, era, a, lone, american, genius, challenges, the, soviet, chess, machine, and, defeats, it, dutch, grandmaster, jan, timman, calls, fischer, s, victory, the, story, of, a, lonely, hero, who, overcomes, an, entire, empire, fischer, s, sister, observed, bobby, did, all, this, in, a, country, almost, totally, without, a, chess, culture, it, was, as, if, an, eskimo, had, cleared, a, tennis, court, in, the, snow, and, gone, on, to, win, the, world, championship, upon, fischer, s, return, to, new, york, a, bobby, fischer, day, was, held, he, was, offered, numerous, product, endorsement, offers, worth, at, least, 5, million, 36, 4, million, today, all, of, which, he, declined, he, appeared, on, the, cover, of, sports, illustrated, with, american, olympic, swimming, champion, mark, spitz, and, also, appeared, on, the, dick, cavett, show, as, well, as, on, a, bob, hope, tv, special, membership, in, the, us, chess, federation, doubled, in, 1972, and, peaked, in, 1974, in, american, chess, these, years, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, fischer, boom, this, match, attracted, more, worldwide, interest, than, any, chess, championship, before, or, since, fischer, was, scheduled, to, defend, his, title, in, 1975, against, anatoly, karpov, who, had, emerged, as, his, challenger, fischer, who, had, played, no, competitive, games, since, his, world, championship, match, with, spassky, laid, out, a, proposal, for, the, match, in, september, 1973, in, consultation, with, fide, official, fred, cramer, he, made, three, principal, non, negotiable, demands, fischer, argued, that, these, demands, were, reasonable, because, otherwise, a, player, who, had, taken, the, lead, could, trade, some, pieces, and, draw, some, games, coasting, towards, the, title, this, was, arguably, what, had, happened, in, the, 1972, match, games, 14, 20, were, all, drawn, but, it, was, a, style, of, chess, that, fischer, found, offensive, under, the, proposed, 10, win, format, one, would, still, have, to, play, for, a, win, many, observers, considered, fischer, s, requested, 9, 9, clause, unfair, because, it, would, require, the, challenger, to, win, by, at, least, two, games, 10, 8, botvinnik, called, the, 9, 9, clause, unsporting, korchnoi, david, bronstein, and, lev, alburt, considered, the, 9, 9, clause, reasonable, korchnoi, in, particular, stated, was, fischer, right, in, demanding, that, the, world, title, be, protected, by, a, two, point, handicap, that, the, challenger, would, be, considered, the, winner, with, a, 10, 8, score, and, that, the, champion, would, retain, his, title, in, the, event, of, a, 9, 9, draw, yes, this, was, quite, natural, the, champion, deserves, this, not, to, mention, the, fact, that, further, play, to, the, first, win, in, the, event, of, an, even, score, would, be, nothing, short, of, a, lottery, the, winner, in, that, case, could, not, claim, to, have, won, a, convincing, victory, there, was, also, the, practical, issue, of, hosting, an, unlimited, match, if, neither, player, could, prove, their, superiority, and, there, were, an, endless, series, of, draws, the, cost, of, the, match, would, be, astronomical, a, fide, congress, was, held, in, 1974, during, the, nice, olympiad, the, delegates, voted, in, favor, of, fischer, s, 10, win, proposal, but, rejected, his, other, two, proposals, and, limited, the, number, of, games, in, the, match, to, 36, in, response, to, fide, s, ruling, fischer, sent, a, cable, to, euwe, on, june, 27, 1974, as, i, made, clear, in, my, telegram, to, the, fide, delegates, the, match, conditions, i, proposed, were, non, negotiable, mr, cramer, informs, me, that, the, rules, of, the, winner, being, the, first, player, to, win, ten, games, draws, not, counting, unlimited, number, of, games, and, if, nine, wins, to, nine, match, is, drawn, with, champion, regaining, title, and, prize, fund, split, equally, were, rejected, by, the, fide, delegates, by, so, doing, fide, has, decided, against, my, participation, in, the, 1975, world, chess, championship, therefore, i, resign, my, fide, world, chess, championship, title, sincerely, bobby, fischer, the, delegates, responded, by, reaffirming, their, prior, decisions, but, did, not, accept, fischer, s, resignation, and, requested, that, he, reconsider, due, to, the, continued, efforts, of, us, chess, federation, officials, a, special, fide, congress, was, held, in, march, 1975, in, bergen, netherlands, in, which, it, was, accepted, that, the, match, should, be, of, unlimited, duration, but, the, 9, 9, clause, was, once, again, rejected, by, a, narrow, margin, of, 35, votes, to, 32, fide, set, a, deadline, of, april, 1, 1975, for, fischer, and, karpov, to, confirm, their, participation, in, the, match, no, reply, was, received, from, fischer, by, april, 3, thus, by, default, karpov, officially, became, world, champion, in, his, 1991, autobiography, karpov, professed, regret, that, the, match, had, not, taken, place, and, claimed, that, the, lost, opportunity, to, challenge, fischer, held, back, his, own, chess, development, karpov, met, with, fischer, several, times, after, 1975, in, friendly, but, ultimately, unsuccessful, attempts, to, arrange, a, match, since, karpov, would, never, agree, to, play, to, 10, brian, carney, opined, in, the, wall, street, journal, that, fischer, s, victory, over, spassky, in, 1972, left, him, nothing, to, prove, except, that, perhaps, someone, could, someday, beat, him, and, he, was, not, interested, in, the, risk, of, losing, he, also, opined, that, fischer, s, refusal, to, recognize, peers, also, allowed, his, paranoia, to, flower, the, world, championship, he, won, validated, his, view, of, himself, as, a, chess, player, but, it, also, insulated, him, from, the, humanizing, influences, of, the, world, around, him, he, descended, into, what, can, only, be, considered, a, kind, of, madness, bronstein, felt, that, fischer, had, the, right, to, play, the, match, with, karpov, on, his, own, conditions, years, later, in, his, 1992, match, against, spassky, fischer, similarly, said, that, it, was, karpov, who, refused, to, play, against, him, under, fischer, s, conditions, whether, karpov, could, have, beaten, fischer, is, a, matter, of, speculation, soviet, gm, lev, alburt, felt, that, the, decision, to, not, concede, to, fischer, s, demands, rested, on, karpov, s, sober, view, of, what, he, was, capable, of, spassky, thought, that, fischer, would, have, won, in, 1975, but, karpov, would, have, qualified, again, and, beaten, fischer, in, 1978, according, to, susan, polgar, commentators, are, divided, with, a, slight, majority, believing, fischer, would, have, won, an, opinion, she, shares, former, world, champion, garry, kasparov, argued, that, karpov, would, have, had, good, chances, because, he, had, beaten, spassky, convincingly, and, was, a, new, breed, of, tough, professional, and, indeed, had, higher, quality, games, while, fischer, had, been, inactive, for, three, years, karpov, himself, said, in, 2020, that, he, thought, he, had, chances, although, he, could, not, say, he, would, be, favored, after, the, 1972, world, chess, championship, fischer, did, not, play, a, competitive, game, in, public, for, nearly, 20, years, in, 1977, in, cambridge, massachusetts, he, played, three, games, against, the, mit, greenblatt, computer, program, winning, them, all, he, moved, to, the, los, angeles, area, and, associated, with, the, worldwide, church, of, god, for, a, time, on, may, 26, 1981, while, walking, in, pasadena, fischer, was, arrested, by, a, police, patrolman, because, he, resembled, a, man, who, had, just, committed, a, robbery, in, the, area, fischer, who, alleged, that, he, was, slightly, injured, during, the, arrest, said, that, he, was, held, for, two, days, subjected, to, assault, and, various, types, of, mistreatment, and, released, on, 1, 000, bail, fischer, published, a, 14, page, pamphlet, detailing, his, allegations, of, police, misconduct, saying, that, his, arrest, had, been, a, frame, up, and, set, up, in, 1981, fischer, stayed, at, the, home, of, grandmaster, peter, biyiasas, in, san, francisco, where, over, a, period, of, four, months, he, defeated, biyiasas, seventeen, times, in, a, series, of, speed, games, in, an, interview, with, sports, illustrated, reporter, william, nack, biyiasas, assessed, fischer, s, play, he, was, too, good, there, was, no, use, in, playing, him, it, wasn, t, interesting, i, was, getting, beaten, and, it, wasn, t, clear, to, me, why, it, wasn, t, like, i, made, this, mistake, or, that, mistake, it, was, like, i, was, being, gradually, outplayed, from, the, start, he, wasn, t, taking, any, time, to, think, the, most, depressing, thing, about, it, is, that, i, wasn, t, even, getting, out, of, the, middle, game, to, an, endgame, i, don, t, ever, remember, an, endgame, he, honestly, believes, there, is, no, one, for, him, to, play, no, one, worthy, of, him, i, played, him, and, i, can, attest, to, that, in, 1988, 1990, fischer, had, a, relationship, with, german, chess, player, petra, stadler, who, had, been, put, in, touch, with, fischer, by, spassky, when, stadler, later, published, a, book, about, the, affair, spassky, apologized, to, fischer, fischer, emerged, after, twenty, years, of, isolation, to, play, spassky, then, tied, for, 96th, 102nd, on, the, fide, rating, list, in, a, revenge, match, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1992, this, match, took, place, in, sveti, stefan, and, belgrade, yugoslavia, in, spite, of, a, united, nations, embargo, that, included, sanctions, on, commercial, activities, fischer, demanded, that, the, organizers, bill, the, match, as, the, world, chess, championship, although, garry, kasparov, was, the, recognized, fide, world, champion, fischer, insisted, he, was, still, the, true, world, champion, and, that, for, all, the, games, in, the, fide, sanctioned, world, championship, matches, involving, karpov, korchnoi, and, kasparov, the, outcomes, had, been, prearranged, the, purse, for, the, rematch, was, us, 5, million, with, 3, 35, million, of, the, purse, going, to, the, winner, this, was, and, still, is, the, largest, purse, for, a, match, in, chess, history, according, to, grandmaster, andrew, soltis, were, of, a, fairly, high, quality, particularly, when, compared, with, kasparov, s, championship, matches, of, 1993, 1995, and, 2000, for, example, yet, the, games, also, reminded, many, fans, of, how, out, of, place, fischer, was, in, 1992, he, was, still, playing, the, openings, of, a, previous, generation, he, was, moreover, the, only, strong, player, in, the, world, who, didn, t, trust, computers, and, wasn, t, surrounded, by, seconds, and, supplicants, fischer, won, the, match, with, 10, wins, 5, losses, and, 15, draws, kasparov, stated, bobby, is, playing, ok, nothing, more, maybe, his, strength, is, 2600, or, 2650, it, wouldn, t, be, close, between, us, yasser, seirawan, believed, that, the, match, proved, that, fischer, s, playing, strength, was, somewhere, in, the, top, ten, in, the, world, fischer, and, spassky, gave, ten, press, conferences, during, the, match, seirawan, attended, the, match, and, met, with, fischer, on, several, occasions, the, two, analyzed, some, match, games, and, had, personal, discourse, seirawan, later, wrote, after, september, 23, i, threw, most, of, what, i, d, ever, read, about, bobby, out, of, my, head, sheer, garbage, bobby, is, the, most, misunderstood, misquoted, celebrity, walking, the, face, of, the, earth, he, added, that, fischer, was, not, camera, shy, smiled, and, laughed, easily, was, a, fine, wit, and, wholly, enjoyable, conversationalist, the, us, department, of, the, treasury, warned, fischer, before, the, start, of, the, match, that, his, participation, was, illegal, that, it, would, violate, president, george, h, w, bush, s, executive, order, 12810, imposing, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 757, sanctions, against, engaging, in, economic, activities, in, yugoslavia, in, response, during, the, first, scheduled, press, conference, on, september, 1, 1992, in, front, of, the, international, press, fischer, spat, on, the, us, order, saying, this, is, my, reply, his, violation, of, the, order, led, us, federal, officials, to, initiate, a, warrant, for, his, arrest, upon, completion, of, the, match, citing, in, pertinent, part, title, 50, usc, 1701, 1702, and, 1705, and, executive, order, 12810, before, the, rematch, against, spassky, fischer, had, won, a, training, match, against, svetozar, gligori, in, sveti, stefan, with, six, wins, one, loss, and, three, draws, after, the, 1992,

philippines, local, time, approximately, four, hours, after, the, september, 11, 2001, terrorist, attacks, in, the, us, fischer, was, interviewed, live, by, pablo, mercado, on, the, baguio, station,

applaud, the, act, look, nobody, gets, that, the, us, and, israel, have, been, slaughtering, the, palestinians, for, years, he, also, said, the, horrible, behavior, that, the, us, is, committing, all, over, the, world, this, just, shows, you, that, what, goes, around, comes, around, even, for, the, united, states, fischer, also, referenced, the, movie, seven, days, in, may, 1964, and, said, he,

later, looked, after, fischer, as, a, terminally, ill, patient, gar, ar, s, two, children, especially, his, son, were, very, close, to, fischer, fischer, also, developed, a, friendship, with, magn, s, sk, lason, a, psychiatrist, and, chess, player, who, later, recalled, long, discussions, with, him, on, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, on, december, 10, 2006, fischer, telephoned, an, icelandic, television, station, that, had, just, broadcast, a, chess, game, in, which, one, player, blundered, such, that, his, opponent, was, able, to, mate, on, the, next, move, although, he, tried, to, change, his, mind, upon, seeing, the, mate, the, touch, move, rule, forced, him, to, play, the, blunder, fischer, pointed, out, a, winning, combination, that, could, have, been, played, instead, of, the, blunder, or, the, other, attempted, move, but, had, been, missed, by, the, player, and, commentators, in, 2005, some, of, fischer, s, belongings, were, auctioned, on, ebay, fischer, claimed, in, 2006, that, the, belongings, sold, in, the, us, without, his, permission, were, worth, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, even, billions, of, dollars, in, the, same, interview, fischer, also, said, that, ubs, bank, had, closed, an, account, of, his, and, liquidated, his, assets, against, his, wishes, transferring, the, funds, to, a, bank, in, iceland, on, january, 17, 2008, fischer, died, at, age, 64, from, degenerative, kidney, failure, at, the, landsp, tali, hospital, national, university, hospital, of, iceland, in, reykjav, k, he, originally, had, a, urinary, tract, blockage, but, refused, surgery, or, medication, magn, s, sk, lason, reported, fischer, s, response, to, leg, massages, nothing, soothes, as, much, as, the, human, touch, on, january, 21, fischer, was, buried, in, the, small, christian, cemetery, of, laugard, lir, church, outside, the, town, of, selfoss, 60, kilometres, 37, mi, southeast, of, reykjav, k, after, a, catholic, funeral, presided, over, by, fr, jakob, rolland, of, the, diocese, of, reykjav, k, in, accordance, with, fischer, s, wishes, only, miyoko, watai, gar, ar, sverrisson, and, gar, ar, s, family, were, present, fischer, s, estate, was, estimated, at, 140, million, isk, about, 1, million, or, us, 2, million, it, quickly, became, the, object, of, a, legal, battle, involving, claims, from, four, parties, with, miyoko, watai, ultimately, inheriting, what, remained, of, fischer, s, estate, after, government, claims, the, four, parties, were, fischer, s, japanese, wife, miyoko, watai, his, alleged, filipino, daughter, jinky, young, and, her, mother, marilyn, young, his, two, american, nephews, alexander, and, nicholas, targ, and, their, father, russell, targ, and, the, us, government, claiming, unpaid, taxes, marilyn, young, claimed, that, jinky, was, fischer, s, daughter, citing, as, evidence, jinky, s, birth, and, baptismal, certificates, photographs, a, transaction, record, dated, december, 4, 2007, of, a, bank, remittance, by, fischer, to, jinky, and, jinky, s, dna, through, her, blood, samples, however, magn, s, sk, lason, a, friend, of, fischer, s, said, that, he, was, certain, that, fischer, was, not, the, girl, s, father, in, addition, the, validity, of, miyoko, watai, s, marriage, to, fischer, was, challenged, in, june, 2010, iceland, s, supreme, court, ordered, fischer, s, remains, exhumed, so, that, a, dna, sample, could, be, obtained, in, august, it, was, announced, that, dna, testing, had, ruled, out, fischer, as, the, father, of, jinky, young, and, the, following, march, an, icelandic, court, ruled, that, miyoko, watai, had, married, fischer, on, september, 6, 2004, and, was, therefore, entitled, to, his, estate, fischer, s, nephews, were, ordered, to, pay, watai, s, legal, costs, amounting, to, isk, 6, 6, million, approximately, 57, 000, although, fischer, s, mother, was, jewish, fischer, rejected, attempts, to, label, him, as, jewish, in, a, 1962, interview, with, harper, s, asked, if, he, was, jewish, he, replied, that, he, was, part, jewish, through, his, mother, in, the, same, interview, he, was, quoted, as, saying, i, read, a, book, lately, by, nietzsche, and, he, says, religion, is, just, to, dull, the, senses, of, the, people, i, agree, in, a, 1984, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, encyclopaedia, judaica, fischer, demanded, that, they, remove, his, name, from, future, editions, fischer, associated, with, the, worldwide, church, of, god, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, church, prescribed, saturday, sabbath, and, forbade, work, and, competitive, chess, on, sabbath, according, to, his, friend, and, colleague, larry, evans, in, 1968, fischer, felt, philosophically, that, the, world, was, coming, to, an, end, and, he, might, as, well, make, some, money, by, publishing, my, 60, memorable, games, fischer, thought, that, the, rapture, was, coming, soon, during, the, mid, 1970s, fischer, contributed, significant, money, to, the, worldwide, church, of, god, in, 1972, one, journalist, stated, that, fischer, is, almost, as, serious, about, religion, as, he, is, about, chess, and, the, champion, credited, his, faith, with, greatly, improving, his, chess, yet, prophecies, by, herbert, w, armstrong, went, unfulfilled, fischer, eventually, left, the, church, in, 1977, accusing, it, of, being, satanic, and, vigorously, attacking, its, methods, and, leadership, towards, the, end, of, his, life, fischer, became, interested, in, catholicism, he, bought, his, friend, gar, ar, sverrisson, a, copy, of, basic, catechism, creed, sacraments, morality, prayer, so, sverrisson, could, explain, the, religion, better, to, him, according, to, sverrisson, fischer, talked, to, him, about, transformation, of, society, through, creation, of, harmony, and, that, the, only, hope, for, the, world, is, through, catholicism, fischer, was, also, known, to, have, read, a, synopsis, of, g, k, chesterton, s, works, in, the, years, leading, up, to, his, death, he, requested, a, catholic, funeral, and, this, final, service, was, presided, over, by, catholic, priest, jakob, rolland, fischer, made, numerous, antisemitic, statements, and, professed, a, general, hatred, for, jews, from, at, least, the, early, 1960s, jan, hein, donner, wrote, that, at, the, time, of, bled, 1961, he, idolized, hitler, and, read, everything, about, him, that, he, could, lay, his, hands, on, he, also, championed, a, brand, of, antisemitism, that, could, only, be, thought, up, by, a, mind, completely, cut, off, from, reality, donner, took, fischer, to, a, war, museum, which, left, a, great, impression, since, is, not, an, evil, person, and, afterwards, he, was, more, restrained, in, his, remarks, to, me, at, least, from, the, 1980s, on, fischer, s, comments, about, jews, were, a, major, theme, in, his, public, and, private, remarks, he, openly, denied, the, holocaust, and, called, the, united, states, a, farce, controlled, by, dirty, hook, nosed, circumcised, jew, bastards, between, 1999, and, 2006, fischer, s, primary, means, of, communicating, with, the, public, was, radio, interviews, he, participated, in, at, least, 34, such, broadcasts, mostly, with, radio, stations, in, the, philippines, but, also, in, hungary, iceland, colombia, and, russia, in, 1999, he, gave, a, radio, call, in, interview, to, a, station, in, budapest, hungary, during, which, he, described, himself, as, the, victim, of, an, international, jewish, conspiracy, in, another, radio, interview, fischer, said, that, it, became, clear, to, him, in, 1977, after, reading, the, secret, world, government, by, count, cherep, spiridovich, that, jewish, agencies, were, targeting, him, fischer, s, sudden, reemergence, was, apparently, triggered, when, some, of, his, belongings, which, had, been, stored, in, a, pasadena, california, storage, unit, were, sold, by, the, landlord, who, claimed, it, was, in, response, to, nonpayment, of, rent, fischer, was, also, upset, that, ubs, had, liquidated, his, assets, and, closed, his, account, without, his, permission, when, asked, who, he, thought, was, responsible, for, the, actions, ubs, had, taken, fischer, replied, there, s, no, question, that, the, jew, controlled, united, states, is, behind, this, that, s, obvious, fischer, at, a, press, conference, upon, his, return, to, reykjavik, iceland, lashed, out, at, jeremy, schaap, the, son, of, the, late, dick, schaap, a, sportswriter, who, had, been, a, father, figure, to, fischer, when, growing, up, calling, his, father, a, jewish, snake, for, doubting, fischer, s, sanity, in, his, later, writings, fischer, s, library, contained, antisemitic, and, racist, literature, such, as, mein, kampf, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, and, the, white, man, s, bible, and, nature, s, eternal, religion, by, ben, klassen, founder, of, the, world, church, of, the, creator, a, notebook, written, by, fischer, contains, sentiments, such, as, 12, 13, 99, it, s, time, to, start, randomly, killing, jews, despite, his, views, fischer, remained, on, good, terms, with, jewish, chess, players, while, as, far, as, is, known, fischer, was, never, formally, diagnosed, with, a, mental, disorder, there, has, been, widespread, comment, and, speculation, concerning, his, psychological, condition, based, on, his, extreme, views, and, unusual, behavior, reuben, fine, psychologist, and, chess, player, who, met, fischer, many, times, said, that, some, of, bobby, s, behavior, is, so, strange, unpredictable, odd, and, bizarre, that, even, his, most, ardent, apologists, have, had, a, hard, time, explaining, what, makes, him, tick, and, described, him, as, a, troubled, human, being, with, obvious, personal, problems, valery, krylov, advisor, to, anatoly, karpov, and, a, specialist, in, the, psycho, physiological, rehabilitation, of, sportsmen, believed, fischer, had, schizophrenia, psychologist, joseph, g, ponterotto, from, secondhand, sources, concludes, that, bobby, did, not, meet, all, the, necessary, criteria, to, reach, diagnoses, of, schizophrenia, or, asperger, syndrome, the, evidence, is, stronger, for, paranoid, personality, disorder, magn, s, sk, lason, a, chess, player, psychiatrist, and, head, doctor, of, sogn, institution, for, mentally, ill, offenders, near, selfoss, befriended, fischer, towards, the, end, of, fischer, s, life, from, endgame, fischer, s, 2011, biography, by, frank, brady, skulason, was, not, bobby, s, psychiatrist, as, has, been, implied, in, the, general, press, nor, did, he, offer, bobby, any, analysis, or, psychotherapy, he, was, at, bobby, s, bedside, as, a, friend, to, try, to, do, anything, he, could, for, him, because, of, his, training, however, he, couldn, t, fail, to, take, note, of, bobby, s, mental, condition, he, definitely, was, not, schizophrenic, skulason, said, he, had, problems, possibly, certain, childhood, traumas, that, had, affected, him, he, was, misunderstood, underneath, i, think, he, was, a, caring, sensitive, person, fischer, s, opening, repertoire, was, narrow, in, some, ways, as, white, fischer, almost, exclusively, played, 1, e4, calling, it, best, by, test, throughout, his, career, he, played, 1, d4, only, once, in, a, serious, game, during, a, blitz, tournament, in, spite, of, this, narrowness, he, was, considered, by, some, of, his, rivals, to, be, unpredictable, in, his, opening, play, and, a, difficult, opponent, to, prepare, for, as, black, fischer, would, usually, play, the, najdorf, sicilian, against, 1, e4, and, the, king, s, indian, defense, against, 1, d4, only, rarely, venturing, into, the, nimzo, indian, benoni, gr, nfeld, or, neo, gr, nfeld, fischer, acknowledged, difficulty, playing, against, the, winawer, variation, of, the, french, defense, 1, e4, e6, 2, d4, d5, 3, nc3, bb4, but, maintained, that, the, winawer, was, unsound, because, it, exposed, black, s, kingside, and, that, in, his, view, black, was, trading, off, his, good, bishop, with, 3, bb4, and, bxc3, later, on, fischer, said, i, may, yet, be, forced, to, admit, that, the, winawer, is, sound, but, i, doubt, it, the, defense, is, anti, positional, and, weakens, the, k, side, fischer, was, renowned, for, his, opening, preparation, and, made, numerous, contributions, to, chess, opening, theory, he, was, one, of, the, foremost, experts, on, the, ruy, lopez, a, line, of, the, exchange, variation, 1, e4, e5, 2, nf3, nc6, 3, bb5, a6, 4, bxc6, dxc6, 5, 0, 0, is, sometimes, called, the, fischer, variation, after, he, successfully, resurrected, it, at, the, 1966, havana, olympiad, fischer, s, lifetime, score, with, the, move, 5, 0, 0, in, tournament, and, match, games, was, eight, wins, three, draws, and, no, losses, 86, 36, fischer, was, a, recognized, expert, in, the, black, side, of, the, najdorf, sicilian, and, the, king, s, indian, defense, he, used, the, gr, nfeld, defense, and, neo, gr, nfeld, defense, to, win, his, celebrated, games, against, donald, and, robert, byrne, and, played, a, theoretical, novelty, in, the, gr, nfeld, against, reigning, world, champion, mikhail, botvinnik, refuting, botvinnik, s, prepared, analysis, over, the, board, in, the, nimzo, indian, defense, the, line, beginning, with, 1, d4, nf6, 2, c4, e6, 3, nc3, bb4, 4, e3, b6, 5, ne2, ba6, was, named, after, him, fischer, established, the, viability, of, the, so, called, poisoned, pawn, variation, of, the, najdorf, sicilian, 1, e4, c5, 2, nf3, d6, 3, d4, cxd4, 4, nxd4, nf6, 5, nc3, a6, 6, bg5, e6, 7, f4, qb6, this, bold, queen, sortie, to, snatch, a, pawn, at, the, expense, of, development, had, been, considered, dubious, but, fischer, succeeded, in, proving, its, soundness, out, of, ten, tournament, and, match, games, as, black, in, the, poisoned, pawn, fischer, scored, 70, winning, five, drawing, four, and, losing, only, one, the, 11th, game, of, his, 1972, match, against, spassky, following, fischer, s, use, the, poisoned, pawn, variation, became, a, respected, line, utilized, by, many, of, the, world, s, leading, players, fischer, s, 10, f5, in, this, line, against, efim, geller, quickly, became, the, main, line, of, the, poisoned, pawn, on, the, white, side, of, the, sicilian, fischer, made, advances, to, the, theory, of, the, line, beginning, 1, e4, c5, 2, nf3, d6, 3, d4, cxd4, 4, nxd4, nf6, 5, nc3, a6, or, e6, 6, bc4, which, has, sometimes, been, named, after, him, in, 1961, prompted, by, a, loss, the, year, before, to, spassky, fischer, wrote, an, article, titled, a, bust, to, the, king, s, gambit, for, the, first, issue, of, the, american, chess, quarterly, in, which, he, stated, in, my, opinion, the, king, s, gambit, is, busted, it, loses, by, force, fischer, recommended, 1, e4, e5, 2, f4, exf4, 3, nf3, d6, which, has, since, become, known, as, the, fischer, defense, as, a, refutation, to, the, king, s, gambit, fischer, later, played, the, king, s, gambit, as, white, in, three, tournament, games, winning, them, all, fischer, had, excellent, endgame, technique, international, master, jeremy, silman, listed, him, as, one, of, the, five, best, endgame, players, along, with, emanuel, lasker, akiba, rubinstein, jos, ra, l, capablanca, and, vasily, smyslov, calling, fischer, a, master, of, bishop, endings, the, endgame, of, a, rook, bishop, and, pawns, against, a, rook, knight, and, pawns, has, sometimes, been, called, the, fischer, endgame, because, of, several, instructive, wins, by, fischer, with, the, bishop, including, three, against, mark, taimanov, in, 1970, and, 1971, in, 1988, fischer, filed, for, u, s, patent, 4, 884, 255, for, a, new, type, of, chess, clock, which, gave, each, player, a, fixed, period, at, the, start, of, the, game, and, then, added, a, small, increment, after, each, completed, move, an, example, of, fischer, s, patented, clock, was, made, for, and, used, in, the, 1992, rematch, between, fischer, and, spassky, clocks, based, on, the, fischer, clock, soon, became, standard, in, major, chess, tournaments, fischer, would, later, complain, that, he, was, cheated, out, of, the, royalties, for, this, invention, following, his, re, emergence, onto, the, chess, scene, with, his, 1992, match, against, spassky, fischer, heavily, disparaged, chess, as, it, was, being, played, at, the, highest, levels, as, a, result, on, june, 19, 1996, in, buenos, aires, argentina, fischer, announced, and, advocated, a, variant, of, chess, called, fischerandom, later, also, known, as, chess960, the, goal, of, fischerandom, was, to, ensure, that, a, game, between, two, players, is, a, contest, between, their, understandings, of, chess, rather, than, their, abilities, to, prepare, opening, strategies, or, memorize, opening, lines, some, grandmasters, compared, fischer, s, play, to, that, of, a, computer, or, a, player, without, noticeable, weaknesses, biographers, david, edmonds, and, john, eidinow, wrote, faced, with, fischer, s, extraordinary, coolness, his, opponents, assurance, would, begin, to, disintegrate, a, fischer, move, which, at, first, glance, looked, weak, would, be, reassessed, it, must, have, a, deep, master, plan, behind, it, undetectable, by, mere, mortals, more, often, than, not, they, were, right, it, did, the, us, grandmaster, robert, byrne, labeled, the, phenomenon, fischer, fear, grandmasters, would, wilt, their, suits, would, crumple, sweat, would, glisten, on, their, brows, panic, would, overwhelm, their, nervous, systems, errors, would, creep, in, calculations, would, go, awry, there, was, talk, among, grandmasters, that, fischer, hypnotized, his, opponents, that, he, undermined, their, intellectual, powers, with, a, dark, mystic, insidious, force, kasparov, wrote, that, fischer, became, the, detonator, of, an, avalanche, of, new, chess, ideas, a, revolutionary, whose, revolution, is, still, in, progress, in, january, 2009, reigning, world, champion, viswanathan, anand, described, him, as, the, greatest, chess, player, who, ever, lived, serbian, gm, ljubomir, ljubojevi, called, fischer, a, man, without, frontiers, he, didn, t, divide, the, east, and, the, west, he, brought, them, together, in, their, admiration, of, him, german, gm, karsten, m, ller, wrote, fischer, who, had, taken, the, highest, crown, almost, singlehandedly, from, the, mighty, almost, invincible, soviet, chess, empire, shook, the, whole, world, not, only, the, chess, world, to, its, core, he, started, a, chess, boom, not, only, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, western, hemisphere, but, worldwide, teaching, chess, or, playing, chess, as, a, career, had, truly, become, a, respectable, profession, after, bobby, the, game, was, simply, not, the, same, rapid, blitz, and, blindfold, games, not, included, listed, as, wins, losses, draws, players, who, have, been, world, champions, in, boldface, in, 2001, nigel, short, wrote, in, the, sunday, telegraph, chess, column, that, he, believed, he, had, been, secretly, playing, fischer, on, the, internet, chess, club, icc, in, speed, chess, matches, subsequently, others, claimed, to, have, played, fischer, as, well, fischer, denied, ownership, of, the, account, fischer, played, 752, tournament, games, in, his, career, winning, 417, drawing, 251, and, losing, 84, these, include, however, games, when, he, was, very, young, if, only, the, games, after, he, turned, 20, are, considered, he, played, 311, tournament, games, and, lost, 23, a, 7, 4, loss, percentage, the, 1955, us, amateur, championship, was, the, first, tournament, organized, by, the, us, chess, federation, in, which, fischer, entered, before, this, tournament, he, had, played, in, the, brooklyn, chess, club, championships, in, some, tournaments, organized, by, the, brooklyn, ymca, chess, and, checker, club, and, in, a, correspondence, chess, tournament, organized, by, chess, review
