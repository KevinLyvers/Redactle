heterodox, john, maynard, keynes, 1st, baron, keynes, cb, fba, k, e, n, z, kaynz, 5, june, 1883, 21, april, 1946, was, an, english, economist, and, philosopher, whose, ideas, fundamentally, changed, the, theory, and, practice, of, macroeconomics, and, the, economic, policies, of, governments, originally, trained, in, mathematics, he, built, on, and, greatly, refined, earlier, work, on, the, causes, of, business, cycles, one, of, the, most, influential, economists, of, the, 20th, century, he, produced, writings, that, are, the, basis, for, the, school, of, thought, known, as, keynesian, economics, and, its, various, offshoots, his, ideas, reformulated, as, new, keynesianism, are, fundamental, to, mainstream, macroeconomics, he, is, known, as, the, father, of, macroeconomics, during, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, keynes, spearheaded, a, revolution, in, economic, thinking, challenging, the, ideas, of, neoclassical, economics, that, held, that, free, markets, would, in, the, short, to, medium, term, automatically, provide, full, employment, as, long, as, workers, were, flexible, in, their, wage, demands, he, argued, that, aggregate, demand, total, spending, in, the, economy, determined, the, overall, level, of, economic, activity, and, that, inadequate, aggregate, demand, could, lead, to, prolonged, periods, of, high, unemployment, and, since, wages, and, labour, costs, are, rigid, downwards, the, economy, will, not, automatically, rebound, to, full, employment, keynes, advocated, the, use, of, fiscal, and, monetary, policies, to, mitigate, the, adverse, effects, of, economic, recessions, and, depressions, he, detailed, these, ideas, in, his, magnum, opus, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, published, in, early, 1936, by, the, late, 1930s, leading, western, economies, had, begun, adopting, keynes, s, policy, recommendations, almost, all, capitalist, governments, had, done, so, by, the, end, of, the, two, decades, following, keynes, s, death, in, 1946, as, a, leader, of, the, british, delegation, keynes, participated, in, the, design, of, the, international, economic, institutions, established, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, but, was, overruled, by, the, american, delegation, on, several, aspects, keynes, s, influence, started, to, wane, in, the, 1970s, partly, as, a, result, of, the, stagflation, that, plagued, the, british, and, american, economies, during, that, decade, and, partly, because, of, criticism, of, keynesian, policies, by, milton, friedman, and, other, monetarists, who, disputed, the, ability, of, government, to, favourably, regulate, the, business, cycle, with, fiscal, policy, the, advent, of, the, global, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, sparked, a, resurgence, in, keynesian, thought, keynesian, economics, provided, the, theoretical, underpinning, for, economic, policies, undertaken, in, response, to, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, by, president, barack, obama, of, the, united, states, prime, minister, gordon, brown, of, the, united, kingdom, and, other, heads, of, governments, when, time, magazine, included, keynes, among, its, most, important, people, of, the, century, in, 1999, it, reported, that, his, radical, idea, that, governments, should, spend, money, they, don, t, have, may, have, saved, capitalism, the, economist, has, described, keynes, as, britain, s, most, famous, 20th, century, economist, in, addition, to, being, an, economist, keynes, was, also, a, civil, servant, a, director, of, the, bank, of, england, and, a, part, of, the, bloomsbury, group, of, intellectuals, john, maynard, keynes, was, born, in, cambridge, england, in, june, 1883, to, an, upper, middle, class, family, his, father, john, neville, keynes, was, an, economist, and, a, lecturer, in, moral, sciences, at, the, university, of, cambridge, and, his, mother, florence, ada, keynes, a, local, social, reformer, keynes, was, the, firstborn, and, was, followed, by, two, more, children, margaret, neville, keynes, in, 1885, and, geoffrey, keynes, in, 1887, geoffrey, became, a, surgeon, and, margaret, married, the, nobel, prize, winning, physiologist, archibald, hill, according, to, the, economic, historian, and, biographer, robert, skidelsky, keynes, s, parents, were, loving, and, attentive, they, attended, a, congregational, church, and, remained, in, the, same, house, throughout, their, lives, where, the, children, were, always, welcome, to, return, keynes, received, considerable, support, from, his, father, including, expert, coaching, to, help, him, pass, his, scholarship, exams, and, financial, help, both, as, a, young, man, and, when, his, assets, were, nearly, wiped, out, at, the, onset, of, great, depression, in, 1929, keynes, s, mother, made, her, children, s, interests, her, own, and, according, to, skidelsky, because, she, could, grow, up, with, her, children, they, never, outgrew, home, in, january, 1889, at, the, age, of, five, and, a, half, keynes, started, at, the, kindergarten, of, the, perse, school, for, girls, for, five, mornings, a, week, he, quickly, showed, a, talent, for, arithmetic, but, his, health, was, poor, leading, to, several, long, absences, he, was, tutored, at, home, by, a, governess, beatrice, mackintosh, and, his, mother, in, january, 1892, at, eight, and, a, half, he, started, as, a, day, pupil, at, st, faith, s, preparatory, school, by, 1894, keynes, was, top, of, his, class, and, excelling, at, mathematics, in, 1896, st, faith, s, headmaster, ralph, goodchild, wrote, that, keynes, was, head, and, shoulders, above, all, the, other, boys, in, the, school, and, was, confident, that, keynes, could, get, a, scholarship, to, eton, in, 1897, keynes, won, a, king, s, scholarship, to, eton, college, where, he, displayed, talent, in, a, wide, range, of, subjects, particularly, mathematics, classics, and, history, in, 1901, he, was, awarded, the, tomline, prize, for, mathematics, at, eton, keynes, experienced, the, first, love, of, his, life, in, dan, macmillan, older, brother, of, the, future, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, despite, his, middle, class, background, keynes, mixed, easily, with, upper, class, pupils, in, 1902, keynes, left, eton, for, king, s, college, cambridge, after, receiving, a, scholarship, for, this, also, to, read, mathematics, alfred, marshall, begged, keynes, to, become, an, economist, although, keynes, s, own, inclinations, drew, him, towards, philosophy, especially, the, ethical, system, of, g, e, moore, keynes, was, elected, to, the, university, pitt, club, and, was, an, active, member, of, the, semi, secretive, cambridge, apostles, society, a, debating, club, largely, reserved, for, the, brightest, students, like, many, members, keynes, retained, a, bond, to, the, club, after, graduating, and, continued, to, attend, occasional, meetings, throughout, his, life, before, leaving, cambridge, keynes, became, the, president, of, the, cambridge, union, society, and, cambridge, university, liberal, club, he, was, said, to, be, an, atheist, in, may, 1904, he, received, a, first, class, ba, in, mathematics, aside, from, a, few, months, spent, on, holidays, with, family, and, friends, keynes, continued, to, involve, himself, with, the, university, over, the, next, two, years, he, took, part, in, debates, further, studied, philosophy, and, attended, economics, lectures, informally, as, a, graduate, student, for, one, term, which, constituted, his, only, formal, education, in, the, subject, he, took, civil, service, exams, in, 1906, the, economist, harry, johnson, wrote, that, the, optimism, imparted, by, keynes, s, early, life, is, a, key, to, understanding, his, later, thinking, keynes, was, always, confident, he, could, find, a, solution, to, whatever, problem, he, turned, his, attention, to, and, retained, a, lasting, faith, in, the, ability, of, government, officials, to, do, good, keynes, s, optimism, was, also, cultural, in, two, senses, he, was, of, the, last, generation, raised, by, an, empire, still, at, the, height, of, its, power, and, was, also, of, the, last, generation, who, felt, entitled, to, govern, by, culture, rather, than, by, expertise, according, to, skidelsky, the, sense, of, cultural, unity, current, in, britain, from, the, 19th, century, to, the, end, of, world, war, i, provided, a, framework, with, which, the, well, educated, could, set, various, spheres, of, knowledge, in, relation, to, each, other, and, life, enabling, them, to, confidently, draw, from, different, fields, when, addressing, practical, problems, in, october, 1906, keynes, began, his, civil, service, career, as, a, clerk, in, the, india, office, he, enjoyed, his, work, at, first, but, by, 1908, had, become, bored, and, resigned, his, position, to, return, to, cambridge, and, work, on, probability, theory, through, a, lectureship, in, economics, at, first, funded, personally, by, economists, alfred, marshall, and, arthur, pigou, he, became, a, fellow, of, king, s, college, in, 1909, by, 1909, keynes, had, also, published, his, first, professional, economics, article, in, the, economic, journal, about, the, effect, of, a, recent, global, economic, downturn, on, india, he, founded, the, political, economy, club, a, weekly, discussion, group, keynes, s, earnings, rose, further, as, he, began, to, take, on, pupils, for, private, tuition, in, 1911, keynes, was, made, the, editor, of, the, economic, journal, by, 1913, he, had, published, his, first, book, indian, currency, and, finance, he, was, then, appointed, to, the, royal, commission, on, indian, currency, and, finance, the, same, topic, as, his, book, where, keynes, showed, considerable, talent, at, applying, economic, theory, to, practical, problems, his, written, work, was, published, under, the, name, j, m, keynes, though, to, his, family, and, friends, he, was, known, as, maynard, his, father, john, neville, keynes, was, also, always, known, by, his, middle, name, the, british, government, called, on, keynes, s, expertise, during, the, first, world, war, while, he, did, not, formally, rejoin, the, civil, service, in, 1914, keynes, travelled, to, london, at, the, government, s, request, a, few, days, before, hostilities, started, bankers, had, been, pushing, for, the, suspension, of, specie, payments, the, gold, equivalent, of, banknotes, but, with, keynes, s, help, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, then, lloyd, george, was, persuaded, that, this, would, be, a, bad, idea, as, it, would, hurt, the, future, reputation, of, the, city, if, payments, were, suspended, before, it, was, necessary, in, january, 1915, keynes, took, up, an, official, government, position, at, the, treasury, among, his, responsibilities, were, the, design, of, terms, of, credit, between, britain, and, its, continental, allies, during, the, war, and, the, acquisition, of, scarce, currencies, according, to, economist, robert, lekachman, keynes, s, nerve, and, mastery, became, legendary, because, of, his, performance, of, these, duties, as, in, the, case, where, he, managed, to, assemble, a, supply, of, spanish, pesetas, the, secretary, of, the, treasury, was, delighted, to, hear, keynes, had, amassed, enough, to, provide, a, temporary, solution, for, the, british, government, but, keynes, did, not, hand, the, pesetas, over, choosing, instead, to, sell, them, all, to, break, the, market, his, boldness, paid, off, as, pesetas, then, became, much, less, scarce, and, expensive, on, the, introduction, of, military, conscription, in, 1916, he, applied, for, exemption, as, a, conscientious, objector, which, was, effectively, granted, conditional, upon, continuing, his, government, work, in, the, 1917, king, s, birthday, honours, keynes, was, appointed, companion, of, the, order, of, the, bath, for, his, wartime, work, and, his, success, led, to, the, appointment, that, had, a, huge, effect, on, keynes, s, life, and, career, keynes, was, appointed, financial, representative, for, the, treasury, to, the, 1919, versailles, peace, conference, he, was, also, appointed, officer, of, the, belgian, order, of, leopold, keynes, s, experience, at, versailles, was, influential, in, shaping, his, future, outlook, yet, it, was, not, a, successful, one, keynes, s, main, interest, had, been, in, trying, to, prevent, germany, s, compensation, payments, being, set, so, high, it, would, traumatise, innocent, german, people, damage, the, nation, s, ability, to, pay, and, sharply, limit, its, ability, to, buy, exports, from, other, countries, thus, hurting, not, just, germany, s, economy, but, that, of, the, wider, world, unfortunately, for, keynes, conservative, powers, in, the, coalition, that, emerged, from, the, 1918, coupon, election, were, able, to, ensure, that, both, keynes, himself, and, the, treasury, were, largely, excluded, from, formal, high, level, talks, concerning, reparations, their, place, was, taken, by, the, heavenly, twins, the, judge, lord, sumner, and, the, banker, lord, cunliffe, whose, nickname, derived, from, the, astronomically, high, war, compensation, they, wanted, to, demand, from, germany, keynes, was, forced, to, try, to, exert, influence, mostly, from, behind, the, scenes, the, three, principal, players, at, the, paris, conferences, were, britain, s, lloyd, george, france, s, georges, clemenceau, and, america, s, president, woodrow, wilson, it, was, only, lloyd, george, to, whom, keynes, had, much, direct, access, until, the, 1918, election, he, had, some, sympathy, with, keynes, s, view, but, while, campaigning, had, found, his, speeches, were, well, received, by, the, public, only, if, he, promised, to, harshly, punish, germany, and, had, therefore, committed, his, delegation, to, extracting, high, payments, lloyd, george, did, however, win, some, loyalty, from, keynes, with, his, actions, at, the, paris, conference, by, intervening, against, the, french, to, ensure, the, dispatch, of, much, needed, food, supplies, to, german, civilians, clemenceau, also, pushed, for, substantial, reparations, though, not, as, high, as, those, proposed, by, the, british, while, on, security, grounds, france, argued, for, an, even, more, severe, settlement, than, britain, wilson, initially, favoured, relatively, lenient, treatment, of, germany, he, feared, too, harsh, conditions, could, foment, the, rise, of, extremism, and, wanted, germany, to, be, left, sufficient, capital, to, pay, for, imports, to, keynes, s, dismay, lloyd, george, and, clemenceau, were, able, to, pressure, wilson, to, agree, to, include, pensions, in, the, reparations, bill, towards, the, end, of, the, conference, keynes, came, up, with, a, plan, that, he, argued, would, not, only, help, germany, and, other, impoverished, central, european, powers, but, also, be, good, for, the, world, economy, as, a, whole, it, involved, the, radical, writing, down, of, war, debts, which, would, have, had, the, possible, effect, of, increasing, international, trade, all, round, but, at, the, same, time, thrown, over, two, thirds, of, the, cost, of, european, reconstruction, on, the, united, states, lloyd, george, agreed, it, might, be, acceptable, to, the, british, electorate, however, america, was, against, the, plan, the, us, was, then, the, largest, creditor, and, by, this, time, wilson, had, started, to, believe, in, the, merits, of, a, harsh, peace, and, thought, that, his, country, had, already, made, excessive, sacrifices, hence, despite, his, best, efforts, the, result, of, the, conference, was, a, treaty, which, disgusted, keynes, both, on, moral, and, economic, grounds, and, led, to, his, resignation, from, the, treasury, in, june, 1919, he, turned, down, an, offer, to, become, chairman, of, the, british, bank, of, northern, commerce, a, job, that, promised, a, salary, of, 2, 000, in, return, for, a, morning, per, week, of, work, keynes, s, analysis, on, the, predicted, damaging, effects, of, the, treaty, appeared, in, the, highly, influential, book, the, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, published, in, 1919, this, work, has, been, described, as, keynes, s, best, book, where, he, was, able, to, bring, all, his, gifts, to, bear, his, passion, as, well, as, his, skill, as, an, economist, in, addition, to, economic, analysis, the, book, contained, appeals, to, the, reader, s, sense, of, compassion, i, cannot, leave, this, subject, as, though, its, just, treatment, wholly, depended, either, on, our, pledges, or, on, economic, facts, the, policy, of, reducing, germany, to, servitude, for, a, generation, of, degrading, the, lives, of, millions, of, human, beings, and, of, depriving, a, whole, nation, of, happiness, should, be, abhorrent, and, detestable, abhorrent, and, detestable, even, if, it, was, possible, even, if, it, enriched, ourselves, even, if, it, did, not, sow, the, decay, of, the, whole, civilized, life, of, europe, also, present, was, striking, imagery, such, as, year, by, year, germany, must, be, kept, impoverished, and, her, children, starved, and, crippled, along, with, bold, predictions, which, were, later, justified, by, events, if, we, aim, deliberately, at, the, impoverishment, of, central, europe, vengeance, i, dare, predict, will, not, limp, nothing, can, then, delay, for, very, long, that, final, war, between, the, forces, of, reaction, and, the, despairing, convulsions, of, revolution, before, which, the, horrors, of, the, late, german, war, will, fade, into, nothing, keynes, s, followers, assert, that, his, predictions, of, disaster, were, borne, out, when, the, german, economy, suffered, the, hyperinflation, of, 1923, and, again, by, the, collapse, of, the, weimar, republic, and, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, however, historian, ruth, henig, claims, that, most, historians, of, the, paris, peace, conference, now, take, the, view, that, in, economic, terms, the, treaty, was, not, unduly, harsh, on, germany, and, that, while, obligations, and, damages, were, inevitably, much, stressed, in, the, debates, at, paris, to, satisfy, electors, reading, the, daily, newspapers, the, intention, was, quietly, to, give, germany, substantial, help, towards, paying, her, bills, and, to, meet, many, of, the, german, objections, by, amendments, to, the, way, the, reparations, schedule, was, in, practice, carried, out, only, a, small, fraction, of, reparations, was, ever, paid, in, fact, historian, stephen, a, schuker, demonstrates, in, american, reparations, to, germany, 1919, 33, that, the, capital, inflow, from, american, loans, substantially, exceeded, german, out, payments, so, that, on, a, net, basis, germany, received, support, equal, to, four, times, the, amount, of, the, post, second, world, war, marshall, plan, schuker, also, shows, that, in, the, years, after, versailles, keynes, became, an, informal, reparations, adviser, to, the, german, government, wrote, one, of, the, major, german, reparation, notes, and, supported, hyperinflation, on, political, grounds, nevertheless, the, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, gained, keynes, international, fame, even, though, it, also, caused, him, to, be, regarded, as, anti, establishment, it, was, not, until, after, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, that, keynes, was, offered, a, directorship, of, a, major, british, bank, or, an, acceptable, offer, to, return, to, government, with, a, formal, job, however, keynes, was, still, able, to, influence, government, policy, making, through, his, network, of, contacts, his, published, works, and, by, serving, on, government, committees, this, included, attending, high, level, policy, meetings, as, a, consultant, keynes, had, completed, his, a, treatise, on, probability, before, the, war, but, published, it, in, 1921, the, work, was, a, notable, contribution, to, the, philosophical, and, mathematical, underpinnings, of, probability, theory, championing, the, important, view, that, probabilities, were, no, more, or, less, than, truth, values, intermediate, between, simple, truth, and, falsity, keynes, developed, the, first, upper, lower, probabilistic, interval, approach, to, probability, in, chapters, 15, and, 17, of, this, book, as, well, as, having, developed, the, first, decision, weight, approach, with, his, conventional, coefficient, of, risk, and, weight, c, in, chapter, 26, in, addition, to, his, academic, work, the, 1920s, saw, keynes, active, as, a, journalist, selling, his, work, internationally, and, working, in, london, as, a, financial, consultant, in, 1924, keynes, wrote, an, obituary, for, his, former, tutor, alfred, marshall, which, joseph, schumpeter, called, the, most, brilliant, life, of, a, man, of, science, i, have, ever, read, mary, paley, marshall, was, entranced, by, the, memorial, while, lytton, strachey, rated, it, as, one, of, keynes, s, best, works, in, 1922, keynes, continued, to, advocate, reduction, of, german, reparations, with, a, revision, of, the, treaty, he, attacked, the, post, world, war, i, deflation, policies, with, a, tract, on, monetary, reform, in, 1923, a, trenchant, argument, that, countries, should, target, stability, of, domestic, prices, avoiding, deflation, even, at, the, cost, of, allowing, their, currency, to, depreciate, britain, suffered, from, high, unemployment, through, most, of, the, 1920s, leading, keynes, to, recommend, the, depreciation, of, sterling, to, boost, jobs, by, making, british, exports, more, affordable, from, 1924, he, was, also, advocating, a, fiscal, response, where, the, government, could, create, jobs, by, spending, on, public, works, during, the, 1920s, keynes, s, pro, stimulus, views, had, only, limited, effect, on, policymakers, and, mainstream, academic, opinion, according, to, hyman, minsky, one, reason, was, that, at, this, time, his, theoretical, justification, was, muddled, the, tract, had, also, called, for, an, end, to, the, gold, standard, keynes, advised, it, was, no, longer, a, net, benefit, for, countries, such, as, britain, to, participate, in, the, gold, standard, as, it, ran, counter, to, the, need, for, domestic, policy, autonomy, it, could, force, countries, to, pursue, deflationary, policies, at, exactly, the, time, when, expansionary, measures, were, called, for, to, address, rising, unemployment, the, treasury, and, bank, of, england, were, still, in, favour, of, the, gold, standard, and, in, 1925, they, were, able, to, convince, the, then, chancellor, winston, churchill, to, re, establish, it, which, had, a, depressing, effect, on, british, industry, keynes, responded, by, writing, the, economic, consequences, of, mr, churchill, and, continued, to, argue, against, the, gold, standard, until, britain, finally, abandoned, it, in, 1931, keynes, had, begun, a, theoretical, work, to, examine, the, relationship, between, unemployment, money, and, prices, back, in, the, 1920s, the, work, treatise, on, money, was, published, in, 1930, in, two, volumes, a, central, idea, of, the, work, was, that, if, the, amount, of, money, being, saved, exceeds, the, amount, being, invested, which, can, happen, if, interest, rates, are, too, high, then, unemployment, will, rise, this, is, in, part, a, result, of, people, not, wanting, to, spend, too, high, a, proportion, of, what, employers, pay, out, making, it, difficult, in, aggregate, for, employers, to, make, a, profit, another, key, theme, of, the, book, is, the, unreliability, of, financial, indices, for, representing, an, accurate, or, indeed, meaningful, indication, of, general, shifts, in, purchasing, power, of, currencies, over, time, in, particular, he, criticised, the, justification, of, britain, s, return, to, the, gold, standard, in, 1925, at, pre, war, valuation, by, reference, to, the, wholesale, price, index, he, argued, that, the, index, understated, the, effects, of, changes, in, the, costs, of, services, and, labour, keynes, was, deeply, critical, of, the, british, government, s, austerity, measures, during, the, great, depression, he, believed, that, budget, deficits, during, recessions, were, a, good, thing, and, a, natural, product, of, an, economic, slump, he, wrote, for, government, borrowing, of, one, kind, or, another, is, nature, s, remedy, so, to, speak, for, preventing, business, losses, from, being, in, so, severe, a, slump, as, the, present, one, so, great, as, to, bring, production, altogether, to, a, standstill, at, the, height, of, the, great, depression, in, 1933, keynes, published, the, means, to, prosperity, which, contained, specific, policy, recommendations, for, tackling, unemployment, in, a, global, recession, chiefly, counter, cyclical, public, spending, the, means, to, prosperity, contains, one, of, the, first, mentions, of, the, multiplier, effect, while, it, was, addressed, chiefly, to, the, british, government, it, also, contained, advice, for, other, nations, affected, by, the, global, recession, a, copy, was, sent, to, the, newly, elected, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, and, other, world, leaders, the, work, was, taken, seriously, by, both, the, american, and, british, governments, and, according, to, robert, skidelsky, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, later, acceptance, of, keynesian, ideas, though, it, had, little, immediate, practical, influence, in, the, 1933, london, economic, conference, opinions, remained, too, diverse, for, a, unified, course, of, action, to, be, agreed, upon, keynesian, like, policies, were, adopted, by, sweden, and, germany, but, sweden, was, seen, as, too, small, to, command, much, attention, and, keynes, was, deliberately, silent, about, the, successful, efforts, of, germany, as, he, was, dismayed, by, its, imperialist, ambitions, and, its, treatment, of, jews, apart, from, great, britain, keynes, s, attention, was, primarily, focused, on, the, united, states, in, 1931, he, received, considerable, support, for, his, views, on, counter, cyclical, public, spending, in, chicago, then, america, s, foremost, center, for, economic, views, alternative, to, the, mainstream, however, orthodox, economic, opinion, remained, generally, hostile, regarding, fiscal, intervention, to, mitigate, the, depression, until, just, before, the, outbreak, of, war, in, late, 1933, keynes, was, persuaded, by, felix, frankfurter, to, address, president, roosevelt, directly, which, he, did, by, letters, and, face, to, face, in, 1934, after, which, the, two, men, spoke, highly, of, each, other, however, according, to, skidelsky, the, consensus, is, that, keynes, s, efforts, began, to, have, a, more, than, marginal, influence, on, us, economic, policy, only, after, 1939, keynes, s, magnum, opus, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, was, published, in, 1936, it, was, researched, and, indexed, by, one, of, keynes, s, favourite, students, and, later, economist, david, bensusan, butt, the, work, served, as, a, theoretical, justification, for, the, interventionist, policies, keynes, favoured, for, tackling, a, recession, although, keynes, stated, in, his, preface, that, his, general, theory, was, only, secondarily, concerned, with, the, applications, of, this, theory, to, practice, the, circumstances, of, its, publication, were, such, that, his, suggestions, shaped, the, course, of, the, 1930s, in, addition, keynes, introduced, the, world, to, a, new, interpretation, of, taxation, since, the, legal, tender, is, now, defined, by, the, state, inflation, becomes, taxation, by, currency, depreciation, this, hidden, tax, meant, a, that, the, standard, of, value, should, be, governed, by, deliberate, decision, and, b, that, it, was, possible, to, maintain, a, middle, course, between, deflation, and, inflation, this, novel, interpretation, was, inspired, by, the, desperate, search, for, control, over, the, economy, which, permeated, the, academic, world, after, the, depression, the, general, theory, challenged, the, earlier, neoclassical, economic, paradigm, which, had, held, that, provided, it, was, unfettered, by, government, interference, the, market, would, naturally, establish, full, employment, equilibrium, in, doing, so, keynes, was, partly, setting, himself, against, his, former, teachers, marshall, and, pigou, keynes, believed, the, classical, theory, was, a, special, case, that, applied, only, to, the, particular, conditions, present, in, the, 19th, century, his, theory, being, the, general, one, classical, economists, had, believed, in, say, s, law, which, simply, put, states, that, supply, creates, its, demand, and, that, in, a, free, market, workers, would, always, be, willing, to, lower, their, wages, to, a, level, where, employers, could, profitably, offer, them, jobs, an, innovation, from, keynes, was, the, concept, of, price, stickiness, the, recognition, that, in, reality, workers, often, refuse, to, lower, their, wage, demands, even, in, cases, where, a, classical, economist, might, argue, that, it, is, rational, for, them, to, do, so, due, in, part, to, price, stickiness, it, was, established, that, the, interaction, of, aggregate, demand, and, aggregate, supply, may, lead, to, stable, unemployment, equilibria, and, in, those, cases, it, is, on, the, state, not, the, market, that, economies, must, depend, for, their, salvation, in, contrast, keynes, argued, that, demand, is, what, creates, supply, and, not, the, other, way, around, he, questioned, say, s, law, by, asking, what, would, happen, if, the, money, that, is, being, given, to, individuals, is, not, finding, its, way, back, into, the, economy, and, is, saved, instead, he, suggested, the, result, would, be, a, recession, to, tackle, the, fear, of, a, recession, say, s, law, suggests, government, intervention, this, government, intervention, can, be, used, to, prevent, any, further, increase, in, savings, in, the, form, of, a, decreased, interest, rate, decreasing, the, interest, rate, will, encourage, people, to, start, spending, and, investing, again, or, so, it, is, stated, by, say, s, law, the, reason, behind, this, is, that, when, there, is, little, investing, savings, start, to, accumulate, and, reach, a, stopping, point, in, the, flow, of, money, during, the, normal, economic, activity, it, would, be, justified, to, have, savings, because, they, can, be, given, out, as, loans, but, in, this, case, there, is, little, demand, for, them, so, they, are, doing, no, good, for, the, economy, the, supply, of, savings, then, exceeds, the, demand, for, loans, and, the, result, is, lower, prices, or, lower, interest, rates, thus, the, idea, is, that, the, money, that, was, once, saved, is, now, re, invested, or, spent, assuming, lower, interest, rates, appeal, to, consumers, to, keynes, however, this, was, not, always, the, case, and, it, couldn, t, be, assumed, that, lower, interest, rates, would, automatically, encourage, investment, and, spending, again, since, there, is, no, proven, link, between, the, two, the, general, theory, argues, that, demand, not, supply, is, the, key, variable, governing, the, overall, level, of, economic, activity, aggregate, demand, which, equals, total, un, hoarded, income, in, a, society, is, defined, by, the, sum, of, consumption, and, investment, in, a, state, of, unemployment, and, unused, production, capacity, one, can, enhance, employment, and, total, income, only, by, first, increasing, expenditures, for, either, consumption, or, investment, without, government, intervention, to, increase, expenditure, an, economy, can, remain, trapped, in, a, low, employment, equilibrium, the, demonstration, of, this, possibility, has, been, described, as, the, revolutionary, formal, achievement, of, the, work, the, book, advocated, activist, economic, policy, by, government, to, stimulate, demand, in, times, of, high, unemployment, for, example, by, spending, on, public, works, let, us, be, up, and, doing, using, our, idle, resources, to, increase, our, wealth, he, wrote, in, 1928, with, men, and, plants, unemployed, it, is, ridiculous, to, say, that, we, cannot, afford, these, new, developments, it, is, precisely, with, these, plants, and, these, men, that, we, shall, afford, them, the, general, theory, is, often, viewed, as, the, foundation, of, modern, macroeconomics, few, senior, american, economists, agreed, with, keynes, through, most, of, the, 1930s, yet, his, ideas, were, soon, to, achieve, widespread, acceptance, with, eminent, american, professors, such, as, alvin, hansen, agreeing, with, the, general, theory, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, keynes, himself, had, only, limited, participation, in, the, theoretical, debates, that, followed, the, publication, of, the, general, theory, as, he, suffered, a, heart, attack, in, 1937, requiring, him, to, take, long, periods, of, rest, among, others, hyman, minsky, and, post, keynesian, economists, have, argued, that, as, a, result, keynes, s, ideas, were, diluted, by, those, keen, to, compromise, with, classical, economists, or, to, render, his, concepts, with, mathematical, models, like, the, is, lm, model, which, they, argue, distort, keynes, s, ideas, keynes, began, to, recover, in, 1939, but, for, the, rest, of, his, life, his, professional, energies, were, directed, largely, towards, the, practical, side, of, economics, the, problems, of, ensuring, optimum, allocation, of, resources, for, the, war, efforts, post, war, negotiations, with, america, and, the, new, international, financial, order, that, was, presented, at, the, bretton, woods, conference, in, the, general, theory, and, later, keynes, responded, to, the, socialists, who, argued, especially, during, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, that, capitalism, caused, war, he, argued, that, if, capitalism, were, managed, domestically, and, internationally, with, coordinated, international, keynesian, policies, an, international, monetary, system, that, did, not, pit, the, interests, of, countries, against, one, another, and, a, high, degree, of, freedom, of, trade, then, this, system, of, managed, capitalism, could, promote, peace, rather, than, conflict, between, countries, his, plans, during, world, war, ii, for, post, war, international, economic, institutions, and, policies, which, contributed, to, the, creation, at, bretton, woods, of, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, and, later, to, the, creation, of, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, and, eventually, the, world, trade, organization, were, aimed, to, give, effect, to, this, vision, although, keynes, has, been, widely, criticised, especially, by, members, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, for, advocating, irresponsible, government, spending, financed, by, borrowing, in, fact, he, was, a, firm, believer, in, balanced, budgets, and, regarded, the, proposals, for, programmes, of, public, works, during, the, great, depression, as, an, exceptional, measure, to, meet, the, needs, of, exceptional, circumstances, during, the, second, world, war, keynes, argued, in, how, to, pay, for, the, war, published, in, 1940, that, the, war, effort, should, be, largely, financed, by, higher, taxation, and, especially, by, compulsory, saving, essentially, workers, lending, money, to, the, government, rather, than, deficit, spending, to, avoid, inflation, compulsory, saving, would, act, to, dampen, domestic, demand, assist, in, channelling, additional, output, towards, the, war, efforts, would, be, fairer, than, punitive, taxation, and, would, have, the, advantage, of, helping, to, avoid, a, post, war, slump, by, boosting, demand, once, workers, were, allowed, to, withdraw, their, savings, in, september, 1941, he, was, proposed, to, fill, a, vacancy, in, the, court, of, directors, of, the, bank, of, england, and, subsequently, carried, out, a, full, term, from, the, following, april, in, june, 1942, keynes, was, rewarded, for, his, service, with, a, hereditary, peerage, in, the, king, s, birthday, honours, on, 7, july, his, title, was, gazetted, as, baron, keynes, of, tilton, in, the, county, of, sussex, and, he, took, his, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, on, the, liberal, party, benches, as, the, allied, victory, began, to, look, certain, keynes, was, heavily, involved, as, leader, of, the, british, delegation, and, chairman, of, the, world, bank, commission, in, the, mid, 1944, negotiations, that, established, the, bretton, woods, system, the, keynes, plan, concerning, an, international, clearing, union, argued, for, a, radical, system, for, the, management, of, currencies, he, proposed, the, creation, of, a, common, world, unit, of, currency, the, bancor, and, new, global, institutions, a, world, central, bank, and, the, international, clearing, union, keynes, envisaged, these, institutions, as, managing, an, international, trade, and, payments, system, with, strong, incentives, for, countries, to, avoid, substantial, trade, deficits, or, surpluses, the, usa, s, greater, negotiating, strength, however, meant, that, the, outcomes, accorded, more, closely, to, the, more, conservative, plans, of, harry, dexter, white, according, to, us, economist, j, bradford, delong, on, almost, every, point, where, he, was, overruled, by, the, americans, keynes, was, later, proven, correct, by, events, the, two, new, institutions, later, known, as, the, world, bank, and, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, were, founded, as, a, compromise, that, primarily, reflected, the, american, vision, there, would, be, no, incentives, for, states, to, avoid, a, large, trade, surplus, instead, the, burden, for, correcting, a, trade, imbalance, would, continue, to, fall, only, on, the, deficit, countries, which, keynes, had, argued, were, least, able, to, address, the, problem, without, inflicting, economic, hardship, on, their, populations, yet, keynes, was, still, pleased, when, accepting, the, final, agreement, saying, that, if, the, institutions, stayed, true, to, their, founding, principles, the, brotherhood, of, man, will, have, become, more, than, a, phrase, after, the, war, keynes, continued, to, represent, the, united, kingdom, in, international, negotiations, despite, his, deteriorating, health, he, succeeded, in, obtaining, preferential, terms, from, the, united, states, for, new, and, outstanding, debts, to, facilitate, the, rebuilding, of, the, british, economy, just, before, his, death, in, 1946, keynes, told, henry, clay, a, professor, of, social, economics, and, advisor, to, the, bank, of, england, of, his, hopes, that, adam, smith, s, invisible, hand, could, help, britain, out, of, the, economic, hole, it, was, in, i, find, myself, more, and, more, relying, for, a, solution, of, our, problems, on, the, invisible, hand, which, i, tried, to, eject, from, economic, thinking, twenty, years, ago, from, the, end, of, the, great, depression, to, the, mid, 1970s, keynes, provided, the, main, inspiration, for, economic, policymakers, in, europe, america, and, much, of, the, rest, of, the, world, while, economists, and, policymakers, had, become, increasingly, won, over, to, keynes, s, way, of, thinking, in, the, mid, and, late, 1930s, it, was, only, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, that, governments, started, to, borrow, money, for, spending, on, a, scale, sufficient, to, eliminate, unemployment, according, to, the, economist, john, kenneth, galbraith, then, a, us, government, official, charged, with, controlling, inflation, in, the, rebound, of, the, economy, from, wartime, spending, one, could, not, have, had, a, better, demonstration, of, the, keynesian, ideas, the, keynesian, revolution, was, associated, with, the, rise, of, modern, liberalism, in, the, west, during, the, post, war, period, keynesian, ideas, became, so, popular, that, some, scholars, point, to, keynes, as, representing, the, ideals, of, modern, liberalism, as, adam, smith, represented, the, ideals, of, classical, liberalism, after, the, war, winston, churchill, attempted, to, check, the, rise, of, keynesian, policy, making, in, the, united, kingdom, and, used, rhetoric, critical, of, the, mixed, economy, in, his, 1945, election, campaign, despite, his, popularity, as, a, war, hero, churchill, suffered, a, landslide, defeat, to, clement, attlee, whose, government, s, economic, policy, continued, to, be, influenced, by, keynes, s, ideas, in, the, late, 1930s, and, 1940s, economists, notably, john, hicks, franco, modigliani, and, paul, samuelson, attempted, to, interpret, and, formalise, keynes, s, writings, in, terms, of, formal, mathematical, models, in, what, had, become, known, as, the, neoclassical, synthesis, they, combined, keynesian, analysis, with, neoclassical, economics, to, produce, neo, keynesian, economics, which, came, to, dominate, mainstream, macroeconomic, thought, for, the, next, 40, years, by, the, 1950s, keynesian, policies, were, adopted, by, almost, the, entire, developed, world, and, similar, measures, for, a, mixed, economy, were, used, by, many, developing, nations, by, then, keynes, s, views, on, the, economy, had, become, mainstream, in, the, world, s, universities, throughout, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, developed, and, emerging, free, capitalist, economies, enjoyed, exceptionally, high, growth, and, low, unemployment, professor, gordon, fletcher, has, written, that, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, when, keynes, s, influence, was, at, its, peak, appear, in, retrospect, as, a, golden, age, of, capitalism, in, late, 1965, time, magazine, ran, a, cover, article, with, a, title, comment, from, milton, friedman, later, echoed, by, us, president, richard, nixon, we, are, all, keynesians, now, the, article, described, the, exceptionally, favourable, economic, conditions, then, prevailing, and, reported, that, washington, s, economic, managers, scaled, these, heights, by, their, adherence, to, keynes, s, central, theme, the, modern, capitalist, economy, does, not, automatically, work, at, top, efficiency, but, can, be, raised, to, that, level, by, the, intervention, and, influence, of, the, government, the, article, also, states, that, keynes, was, one, of, the, three, most, important, economists, who, ever, lived, and, that, his, general, theory, was, more, influential, than, the, magna, opera, of, other, famous, economists, such, as, adam, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, the, concept, of, the, multiplier, was, first, developed, by, r, f, kahn, in, his, article, the, relation, of, home, investment, to, unemployment, in, the, economic, journal, of, june, 1931, the, kahn, multiplier, was, the, employment, multiplier, keynes, took, the, idea, from, kahn, and, formulated, the, investment, multiplier, keynesian, economics, were, officially, discarded, by, the, british, government, in, 1979, but, forces, had, begun, to, gather, against, keynes, s, ideas, over, 30, years, earlier, friedrich, hayek, had, formed, the, mont, pelerin, society, in, 1947, with, the, explicit, intention, of, nurturing, intellectual, currents, to, one, day, displace, keynesianism, and, other, similar, influences, its, members, included, the, austrian, school, economist, ludwig, von, mises, along, with, the, then, young, milton, friedman, initially, the, society, had, little, impact, on, the, wider, world, according, to, hayek, it, was, as, if, keynes, had, been, raised, to, sainthood, after, his, death, and, that, people, refused, to, allow, his, work, to, be, questioned, friedman, however, began, to, emerge, as, a, formidable, critic, of, keynesian, economics, from, the, mid, 1950s, and, especially, after, his, 1963, publication, of, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, on, the, practical, side, of, economic, life, big, government, had, appeared, to, be, firmly, entrenched, in, the, 1950s, but, the, balance, began, to, shift, towards, the, power, of, private, interests, in, the, 1960s, keynes, had, written, against, the, folly, of, allowing, decadent, and, selfish, speculators, and, financiers, the, kind, of, influence, they, had, enjoyed, after, world, war, i, for, two, decades, after, world, war, ii, public, opinion, was, strongly, against, private, speculators, the, disparaging, label, gnomes, of, zurich, being, typical, of, how, they, were, described, during, this, period, international, speculation, was, severely, restricted, by, the, capital, controls, in, place, after, bretton, woods, according, to, the, journalists, larry, elliott, and, dan, atkinson, 1968, was, the, pivotal, year, when, power, shifted, in, favour, of, private, agents, such, as, currency, speculators, as, the, key, 1968, event, elliott, and, atkinson, picked, out, america, s, suspension, of, the, conversion, of, the, dollar, into, gold, except, on, request, of, foreign, governments, which, they, identified, as, the, beginning, of, the, breakdown, of, the, bretton, woods, system, criticisms, of, keynes, s, ideas, had, begun, to, gain, significant, acceptance, by, the, early, 1970s, as, they, were, then, able, to, make, a, credible, case, that, keynesian, models, no, longer, reflected, economic, reality, keynes, himself, included, few, formulas, and, no, explicit, mathematical, models, in, his, general, theory, for, economists, such, as, hyman, minsky, keynes, s, limited, use, of, mathematics, was, partly, the, result, of, his, scepticism, about, whether, phenomena, as, inherently, uncertain, as, economic, activity, could, ever, be, adequately, captured, by, mathematical, models, nevertheless, many, models, were, developed, by, keynesian, economists, with, a, famous, example, being, the, phillips, curve, which, predicted, an, inverse, relationship, between, unemployment, and, inflation, it, implied, that, unemployment, could, be, reduced, by, government, stimulus, with, a, calculable, cost, to, inflation, in, 1968, milton, friedman, published, a, paper, arguing, that, the, fixed, relationship, implied, by, the, philips, curve, did, not, exist, friedman, suggested, that, sustained, keynesian, policies, could, lead, to, both, unemployment, and, inflation, rising, at, once, a, phenomenon, that, soon, became, known, as, stagflation, in, the, early, 1970s, stagflation, appeared, in, both, the, us, and, britain, just, as, friedman, had, predicted, with, economic, conditions, deteriorating, further, after, the, 1973, oil, crisis, aided, by, the, prestige, gained, from, his, successful, forecast, friedman, led, increasingly, successful, criticisms, against, the, keynesian, consensus, convincing, not, only, academics, and, politicians, but, also, much, of, the, general, public, with, his, radio, and, television, broadcasts, the, academic, credibility, of, keynesian, economics, was, further, undermined, by, additional, criticism, from, other, monetarists, trained, in, the, chicago, school, of, economics, by, the, lucas, critique, and, by, criticisms, from, hayek, s, austrian, school, so, successful, were, these, criticisms, that, by, 1980, robert, lucas, claimed, economists, would, often, take, offence, if, described, as, keynesians, keynesian, principles, fared, increasingly, poorly, on, the, practical, side, of, economics, by, 1979, they, had, been, displaced, by, monetarism, as, the, primary, influence, on, anglo, american, economic, policy, however, many, officials, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, retained, a, preference, for, keynes, and, in, 1984, the, federal, reserve, officially, discarded, monetarism, after, which, keynesian, principles, made, a, partial, comeback, as, an, influence, on, policy, making, not, all, academics, accepted, the, criticism, against, keynes, minsky, has, argued, that, keynesian, economics, had, been, debased, by, excessive, mixing, with, neoclassical, ideas, from, the, 1950s, and, that, it, was, unfortunate, that, this, branch, of, economics, had, even, continued, to, be, called, keynesian, writing, in, the, american, prospect, robert, kuttner, argued, it, was, not, so, much, excessive, keynesian, activism, that, caused, the, economic, problems, of, the, 1970s, but, the, breakdown, of, the, bretton, woods, system, of, capital, controls, which, allowed, capital, flight, from, regulated, economies, into, unregulated, economies, in, a, fashion, similar, to, gresham, s, law, phenomenon, where, weak, currencies, undermine, strong, ones, historian, peter, pugh, has, stated, that, a, key, cause, of, the, economic, problems, afflicting, america, in, the, 1970s, was, the, refusal, to, raise, taxes, to, finance, the, vietnam, war, which, was, against, keynesian, advice, a, more, typical, response, was, to, accept, some, elements, of, the, criticisms, while, refining, keynesian, economic, theories, to, defend, them, against, arguments, that, would, invalidate, the, whole, keynesian, framework, the, resulting, body, of, work, largely, composing, new, keynesian, economics, in, 1992, alan, blinder, wrote, about, a, keynesian, restoration, as, work, based, on, keynes, s, ideas, had, to, some, extent, become, fashionable, once, again, in, academia, though, in, the, mainstream, it, was, highly, synthesised, with, monetarism, and, other, neoclassical, thinking, in, the, world, of, policy, making, free, market, influences, broadly, sympathetic, to, monetarism, have, remained, very, strong, at, government, level, in, powerful, normative, institutions, like, the, world, bank, the, imf, and, us, treasury, and, in, prominent, opinion, forming, media, such, as, the, financial, times, and, the, economist, the, global, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 08, led, to, public, skepticism, about, the, free, market, consensus, even, from, some, on, the, economic, right, in, march, 2008, martin, wolf, chief, economics, commentator, at, the, financial, times, announced, the, death, of, the, dream, of, global, free, market, capitalism, in, the, same, month, macroeconomist, james, k, galbraith, used, the, 25th, annual, milton, friedman, distinguished, lecture, to, launch, a, sweeping, attack, against, the, consensus, for, monetarist, economics, and, argued, that, keynesian, economics, were, far, more, relevant, for, tackling, the, emerging, crises, economist, robert, j, shiller, had, begun, advocating, robust, government, intervention, to, tackle, the, financial, crises, specifically, citing, keynes, nobel, laureate, paul, krugman, also, actively, argued, the, case, for, vigorous, keynesian, intervention, in, the, economy, in, his, columns, for, the, new, york, times, other, prominent, economic, commentators, who, have, argued, for, keynesian, government, intervention, to, mitigate, the, financial, crisis, include, george, akerlof, j, bradford, delong, robert, reich, and, joseph, stiglitz, newspapers, and, other, media, have, also, cited, work, relating, to, keynes, by, hyman, minsky, robert, skidelsky, donald, markwell, and, axel, leijonhufvud, a, series, of, major, bailouts, were, pursued, during, the, financial, crisis, starting, on, 7, september, with, the, announcement, that, the, us, government, was, to, nationalise, the, two, government, sponsored, enterprises, which, oversaw, most, of, the, us, subprime, mortgage, market, fannie, mae, and, freddie, mac, in, october, alistair, darling, the, british, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, referred, to, keynes, as, he, announced, plans, for, substantial, fiscal, stimulus, to, head, off, the, worst, effects, of, recession, in, accordance, with, keynesian, economic, thought, similar, policies, have, been, adopted, by, other, governments, worldwide, this, is, in, stark, contrast, to, the, action, imposed, on, indonesia, during, the, asian, financial, crisis, of, 1997, when, it, was, forced, by, the, imf, to, close, 16, banks, at, the, same, time, prompting, a, bank, run, much, of, the, post, crisis, discussion, reflected, keynes, s, advocacy, of, international, coordination, of, fiscal, or, monetary, stimulus, and, of, international, economic, institutions, such, as, the, imf, and, the, world, bank, which, many, had, argued, should, be, reformed, as, a, new, bretton, woods, and, should, have, been, even, before, the, crises, broke, out, the, imf, and, united, nations, economists, advocated, a, coordinated, international, approach, to, fiscal, stimulus, donald, markwell, argued, that, in, the, absence, of, such, an, international, approach, there, would, be, a, risk, of, worsening, international, relations, and, possibly, even, world, war, arising, from, economic, factors, similar, to, those, present, during, the, depression, of, the, 1930s, by, the, end, of, december, 2008, the, financial, times, reported, that, the, sudden, resurgence, of, keynesian, policy, is, a, stunning, reversal, of, the, orthodoxy, of, the, past, several, decades, in, december, 2008, paul, krugman, released, his, book, the, return, of, depression, economics, and, the, crisis, of, 2008, arguing, that, economic, conditions, similar, to, those, that, existed, during, the, earlier, part, of, the, 20th, century, had, returned, making, keynesian, policy, prescriptions, more, relevant, than, ever, in, february, 2009, robert, j, shiller, and, george, akerlof, published, animal, spirits, a, book, where, they, argue, the, current, us, stimulus, package, is, too, small, as, it, does, not, take, into, account, keynes, s, insight, on, the, importance, of, confidence, and, expectations, in, determining, the, future, behaviour, of, businesspeople, and, other, economic, agents, in, the, march, 2009, speech, entitled, reform, the, international, monetary, system, zhou, xiaochuan, the, governor, of, the, people, s, bank, of, china, came, out, in, favour, of, keynes, s, idea, of, a, centrally, managed, global, reserve, currency, zhou, argued, that, it, was, unfortunate, that, part, of, the, reason, for, the, bretton, woods, system, breaking, down, was, the, failure, to, adopt, keynes, s, bancor, zhou, proposed, a, gradual, move, towards, increased, use, of, imf, special, drawing, rights, sdrs, although, zhou, s, ideas, had, not, been, broadly, accepted, leaders, meeting, in, april, at, the, 2009, g, 20, london, summit, agreed, to, allow, 250, billion, of, special, drawing, rights, to, be, created, by, the, imf, to, be, distributed, globally, stimulus, plans, were, credited, for, contributing, to, a, better, than, expected, economic, outlook, by, both, the, oecd, and, the, imf, in, reports, published, in, june, and, july, 2009, both, organisations, warned, global, leaders, that, recovery, was, likely, to, be, slow, so, counter, recessionary, measures, ought, not, be, rolled, back, too, early, while, the, need, for, stimulus, measures, was, broadly, accepted, among, policymakers, there, had, been, much, debate, over, how, to, fund, the, spending, some, leaders, and, institutions, such, as, angela, merkel, and, the, european, central, bank, expressed, concern, over, the, potential, impact, on, inflation, national, debt, and, the, risk, that, a, too, large, stimulus, will, create, an, unsustainable, recovery, among, professional, economists, the, revival, of, keynesian, economics, has, been, even, more, divisive, although, many, economists, such, as, george, akerlof, paul, krugman, robert, shiller, and, joseph, stiglitz, supported, keynesian, stimulus, others, did, not, believe, higher, government, spending, would, help, the, united, states, economy, recover, from, the, great, recession, some, economists, such, as, robert, lucas, questioned, the, theoretical, basis, for, stimulus, packages, others, like, robert, barro, and, gary, becker, say, that, empirical, evidence, for, beneficial, effects, from, keynesian, stimulus, does, not, exist, however, there, is, a, growing, academic, literature, that, shows, that, fiscal, expansion, helps, an, economy, grow, in, the, near, term, and, that, certain, types, of, fiscal, stimulus, are, particularly, effective, new, keynesian, economics, developed, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, as, a, response, to, the, critique, that, macroeconomics, lacked, microeconomic, foundations, new, keynesianism, developed, models, to, provide, microfoundations, for, keynesian, economics, it, incorporated, parts, of, new, classical, macroeconomics, to, develop, the, new, neoclassical, synthesis, which, forms, the, basis, for, mainstream, macroeconomics, today, two, main, assumptions, define, the, new, keynesian, approach, to, macroeconomics, like, the, new, classical, approach, new, keynesian, macroeconomic, analysis, usually, assumes, that, households, and, firms, have, rational, expectations, however, the, two, schools, differ, in, that, new, keynesian, analysis, usually, assumes, a, variety, of, market, failures, in, particular, new, keynesians, assume, that, there, is, imperfect, competition, in, price, and, wage, setting, to, help, explain, why, prices, and, wages, can, become, sticky, which, means, they, do, not, adjust, instantaneously, to, changes, in, economic, conditions, wage, and, price, stickiness, and, the, other, market, failures, present, in, new, keynesian, models, imply, that, the, economy, may, fail, to, attain, full, employment, therefore, new, keynesians, argue, that, macroeconomic, stabilisation, by, the, government, using, fiscal, policy, and, the, central, bank, using, monetary, policy, can, lead, to, a, more, efficient, macroeconomic, outcome, than, a, laissez, faire, policy, would, on, a, personal, level, keynes, s, charm, was, such, that, he, was, generally, well, received, wherever, he, went, even, those, who, found, themselves, on, the, wrong, side, of, his, occasionally, sharp, tongue, rarely, bore, a, grudge, keynes, s, speech, at, the, closing, of, the, bretton, woods, negotiations, was, received, with, a, lasting, standing, ovation, rare, in, international, relations, as, the, delegates, acknowledged, the, scale, of, his, achievements, made, despite, poor, health, austrian, school, economist, friedrich, hayek, was, keynes, s, most, prominent, contemporary, critic, with, sharply, opposing, views, on, the, economy, yet, after, keynes, s, death, he, wrote, he, was, the, one, really, great, man, i, ever, knew, and, for, whom, i, had, unbounded, admiration, the, world, will, be, a, very, much, poorer, place, without, him, a, colleague, nicholas, davenport, recalled, there, were, deep, emotional, forces, about, maynard, one, could, sense, his, humanity, there, was, nothing, of, the, cold, intellectual, about, him, lionel, robbins, former, head, of, the, economics, department, at, the, london, school, of, economics, who, engaged, in, many, heated, debates, with, keynes, in, the, 1930s, had, this, to, say, after, observing, keynes, in, early, negotiations, with, the, americans, while, drawing, up, plans, for, bretton, woods, this, went, very, well, indeed, keynes, was, in, his, most, lucid, and, persuasive, mood, and, the, effect, was, irresistible, at, such, moments, i, often, find, myself, thinking, that, keynes, must, be, one, of, the, most, remarkable, men, that, have, ever, lived, the, quick, logic, the, birdlike, swoop, of, intuition, the, vivid, fancy, the, wide, vision, above, all, the, incomparable, sense, of, the, fitness, of, words, all, combine, to, make, something, several, degrees, beyond, the, limit, of, ordinary, human, achievement, douglas, lepan, an, official, from, the, canadian, high, commission, wrote, i, am, spellbound, this, is, the, most, beautiful, creature, i, have, ever, listened, to, does, he, belong, to, our, species, or, is, he, from, some, other, order, there, is, something, mythic, and, fabulous, about, him, i, sense, in, him, something, massive, and, sphinx, like, and, yet, also, a, hint, of, wings, bertrand, russell, named, keynes, one, of, the, most, intelligent, people, he, had, ever, known, commenting, keynes, s, intellect, was, the, sharpest, and, clearest, that, i, have, ever, known, when, i, argued, with, him, i, felt, that, i, took, my, life, in, my, hands, and, i, seldom, emerged, without, feeling, something, of, a, fool, keynes, s, obituary, in, the, times, included, the, comment, there, is, the, man, himself, radiant, brilliant, effervescent, gay, full, of, impish, jokes, he, was, a, humane, man, genuinely, devoted, to, the, cause, of, the, common, good, as, a, man, of, the, centre, described, by, some, as, having, the, greatest, impact, of, any, 20th, century, economist, keynes, attracted, considerable, criticism, from, both, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, in, the, 1920s, keynes, was, seen, as, anti, establishment, and, was, mainly, attacked, from, the, right, in, the, red, 1930s, many, young, economists, favoured, marxist, views, even, in, cambridge, and, while, keynes, was, engaging, principally, with, the, right, to, try, to, persuade, them, of, the, merits, of, more, progressive, policy, the, most, vociferous, criticism, against, him, came, from, the, left, who, saw, him, as, a, supporter, of, capitalism, from, the, 1950s, and, onwards, most, of, the, attacks, against, keynes, have, again, been, from, the, right, in, 1931, friedrich, hayek, extensively, critiqued, keynes, s, 1930, treatise, on, money, after, reading, hayek, s, the, road, to, serfdom, keynes, wrote, to, hayek, morally, and, philosophically, i, find, myself, in, agreement, with, virtually, the, whole, of, it, he, concluded, the, letter, with, the, recommendation, what, we, need, therefore, in, my, opinion, is, not, a, change, in, our, economic, programmes, which, would, only, lead, in, practice, to, disillusion, with, the, results, of, your, philosophy, but, perhaps, even, the, contrary, namely, an, enlargement, of, them, your, greatest, danger, is, the, probable, practical, failure, of, the, application, of, your, philosophy, in, the, united, states, on, the, pressing, issue, of, the, time, whether, deficit, spending, could, lift, a, country, from, depression, keynes, replied, to, hayek, s, criticism, in, the, following, way, i, should, conclude, rather, differently, i, should, say, that, what, we, want, is, not, no, planning, or, even, less, planning, indeed, i, should, say, we, almost, certainly, want, more, but, the, planning, should, take, place, in, a, community, in, which, as, many, people, as, possible, both, leaders, and, followers, wholly, share, your, moral, position, moderate, planning, will, be, safe, enough, if, those, carrying, it, out, are, rightly, oriented, in, their, minds, and, hearts, to, the, moral, issue, asked, why, keynes, expressed, moral, and, philosophical, agreement, with, hayek, s, road, to, serfdom, hayek, stated, because, he, believed, that, he, was, fundamentally, still, a, classical, english, liberal, and, wasn, t, quite, aware, of, how, far, he, had, moved, away, from, it, his, basic, ideas, were, still, those, of, individual, freedom, he, did, not, think, systematically, enough, to, see, the, conflicts, he, was, in, a, sense, corrupted, by, political, necessity, according, to, some, observers, hayek, felt, that, the, post, world, war, ii, keynesian, orthodoxy, gave, too, much, power, to, the, state, and, that, such, policies, would, lead, toward, socialism, while, milton, friedman, described, the, general, theory, as, a, great, book, he, argues, that, its, implicit, separation, of, nominal, from, real, magnitudes, is, neither, possible, nor, desirable, macroeconomic, policy, friedman, argues, can, reliably, influence, only, the, nominal, he, and, other, monetarists, have, consequently, argued, that, keynesian, economics, can, result, in, stagflation, the, combination, of, low, growth, and, high, inflation, that, developed, economies, suffered, in, the, early, 1970s, more, to, friedman, s, taste, was, the, tract, on, monetary, reform, 1923, which, he, regarded, as, keynes, s, best, work, because, of, its, focus, on, maintaining, domestic, price, stability, joseph, schumpeter, was, an, economist, of, the, same, age, as, keynes, and, one, of, his, main, rivals, he, was, among, the, first, reviewers, to, argue, that, keynes, s, general, theory, was, not, a, general, theory, but, a, special, case, he, said, the, work, expressed, the, attitude, of, a, decaying, civilisation, after, keynes, s, death, schumpeter, wrote, a, brief, biographical, piece, keynes, the, economist, on, a, personal, level, he, was, very, positive, about, keynes, as, a, man, praising, his, pleasant, nature, courtesy, and, kindness, he, assessed, some, of, keynes, s, biographical, and, editorial, work, as, among, the, best, he, d, ever, seen, yet, schumpeter, remained, critical, of, keynes, s, economics, linking, keynes, s, childlessness, to, what, schumpeter, saw, as, an, essentially, short, term, view, he, considered, keynes, to, have, a, kind, of, unconscious, patriotism, that, caused, him, to, fail, to, understand, the, problems, of, other, nations, for, schumpeter, practical, keynesianism, is, a, seedling, which, cannot, be, transplanted, into, foreign, soil, it, dies, there, and, becomes, poisonous, as, it, dies, he, admired, and, envied, keynes, but, when, keynes, died, in, 1946, schumpeter, s, obituary, gave, keynes, this, same, off, key, perfunctory, treatment, he, would, later, give, adam, smith, in, the, history, of, economic, analysis, the, discredit, of, not, adding, a, single, innovation, to, the, techniques, of, economic, analysis, ludwig, von, mises, an, austrian, economist, describes, a, keynesian, system, as, believing, it, can, solve, most, problems, with, more, money, and, credit, which, leads, to, a, system, of, inflationism, in, which, prices, of, goods, rise, higher, and, higher, murray, rothbard, wrote, that, keynesian, style, governmental, regulation, of, money, and, credit, created, a, dismal, monetary, and, banking, situation, since, it, allows, for, the, central, bankers, that, have, the, exclusive, ability, to, print, money, to, be, unchecked, and, out, of, control, rothbard, went, on, to, say, in, an, interview, that, there, is, one, good, thing, about, karl, marx, he, was, not, a, keynesian, president, harry, s, truman, was, sceptical, of, keynesian, theorising, he, told, leon, keyserling, a, keynesian, economist, who, chaired, truman, s, council, of, economic, advisers, nobody, can, ever, convince, me, that, government, can, spend, a, dollar, that, it, s, not, got, some, critics, have, sought, to, show, that, keynes, had, sympathies, towards, nazism, and, a, number, of, writers, have, described, him, as, antisemitic, keynes, s, private, letters, contain, portraits, and, descriptions, some, of, which, can, be, characterised, as, antisemitic, while, others, as, philosemitic, scholars, have, suggested, that, these, reflect, clich, s, current, at, the, time, that, he, accepted, uncritically, rather, than, any, racism, on, several, occasions, keynes, used, his, influence, to, help, his, jewish, friends, most, notably, when, he, successfully, lobbied, for, ludwig, wittgenstein, to, be, allowed, residency, in, the, united, kingdom, explicitly, to, rescue, him, from, being, deported, to, nazi, occupied, austria, keynes, was, a, supporter, of, zionism, serving, on, committees, supporting, the, cause, allegations, that, he, was, racist, or, had, totalitarian, beliefs, have, been, rejected, by, robert, skidelsky, and, other, biographers, professor, gordon, fletcher, wrote, that, the, suggestion, of, a, link, between, keynes, and, any, support, of, totalitarianism, cannot, be, sustained, once, the, aggressive, tendencies, of, the, nazis, towards, jews, and, other, minorities, had, become, apparent, keynes, made, clear, his, loathing, of, nazism, as, a, lifelong, pacifist, he, had, initially, favoured, peaceful, containment, of, nazi, germany, yet, he, began, to, advocate, a, forceful, resolution, while, many, conservatives, were, still, arguing, for, appeasement, after, the, war, started, he, roundly, criticised, the, left, for, losing, their, nerve, to, confront, adolf, hitler, saying, the, intelligentsia, of, the, left, were, the, loudest, in, demanding, that, the, nazi, aggression, should, be, resisted, at, all, costs, when, it, comes, to, a, showdown, scarce, four, weeks, have, passed, before, they, remember, that, they, are, pacifists, and, write, defeatist, letters, to, your, columns, leaving, the, defence, of, freedom, and, civilisation, to, colonel, blimp, and, the, old, school, tie, for, whom, three, cheers, keynes, has, been, characterised, as, being, indifferent, or, even, positive, about, mild, inflation, he, had, expressed, a, preference, for, inflation, over, deflation, saying, that, if, one, has, to, choose, between, the, two, evils, it, is, better, to, disappoint, the, rentier, than, to, inflict, pain, on, working, class, families, keynes, was, also, aware, of, the, dangers, of, inflation, in, the, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, he, wrote, lenin, is, said, to, have, declared, that, the, best, way, to, destroy, the, capitalist, system, was, to, debauch, the, currency, by, a, continuing, process, of, inflation, governments, can, confiscate, secretly, and, unobserved, an, important, part, of, the, wealth, of, their, citizens, there, is, no, subtler, no, surer, means, of, overturning, the, existing, basis, of, society, than, to, debauch, the, currency, the, process, engages, all, the, hidden, forces, of, economic, law, on, the, side, of, destruction, and, does, it, in, a, manner, which, not, one, man, in, a, million, is, able, to, diagnose, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, keynes, was, an, economist, close, to, alfred, marshall, deeply, convinced, of, the, benefits, of, free, trade, from, the, crisis, of, 1929, onwards, noting, the, commitment, of, the, british, authorities, to, defend, the, gold, parity, of, the, pound, sterling, and, the, rigidity, of, nominal, wages, he, gradually, adhered, to, protectionist, measures, on, 5, november, 1929, when, heard, by, the, macmillan, committee, to, bring, the, british, economy, out, of, the, crisis, keynes, indicated, that, the, introduction, of, tariffs, on, imports, would, help, to, rebalance, the, trade, balance, the, committee, s, report, states, in, a, section, entitled, import, control, and, export, aid, that, in, an, economy, where, there, is, not, full, employment, the, introduction, of, tariffs, can, improve, production, and, employment, thus, the, reduction, of, the, trade, deficit, favours, the, country, s, growth, in, january, 1930, in, the, economic, advisory, council, keynes, proposed, the, introduction, of, a, system, of, protection, to, reduce, imports, in, the, autumn, of, 1930, he, proposed, a, uniform, tariff, of, 10, on, all, imports, and, subsidies, of, the, same, rate, for, all, exports, in, the, treatise, on, money, published, in, the, autumn, of, 1930, he, took, up, the, idea, of, tariffs, or, other, trade, restrictions, with, the, aim, of, reducing, the, volume, of, imports, and, rebalancing, the, balance, of, trade, on, 7, march, 1931, in, the, new, statesman, and, nation, he, wrote, an, article, entitled, proposal, for, a, tariff, revenue, he, pointed, out, that, the, reduction, in, wages, led, to, a, reduction, in, national, demand, which, constrained, markets, instead, he, proposed, the, idea, of, an, expansionary, policy, combined, with, a, tariff, system, to, neutralise, the, effects, on, the, balance, of, trade, the, application, of, customs, tariffs, seemed, to, him, unavoidable, whoever, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, might, be, thus, for, keynes, an, economic, recovery, policy, is, only, fully, effective, if, the, trade, deficit, is, eliminated, he, proposed, a, 15, tax, on, manufactured, and, semi, manufactured, goods, and, 5, on, certain, foodstuffs, and, raw, materials, with, others, needed, for, exports, exempted, wool, cotton, in, 1932, in, an, article, entitled, the, pro, and, anti, tariffs, published, in, the, listener, he, envisaged, the, protection, of, farmers, and, certain, sectors, such, as, the, automobile, and, iron, and, steel, industries, considering, them, indispensable, to, britain, in, the, post, crisis, situation, of, 1929, keynes, judged, the, assumptions, of, the, free, trade, model, unrealistic, he, criticised, for, example, the, neoclassical, assumption, of, wage, adjustment, as, early, as, 1930, in, a, note, to, the, economic, advisory, council, he, doubted, the, intensity, of, the, gain, from, specialisation, in, the, case, of, manufactured, goods, while, participating, in, the, macmillan, committee, he, admitted, that, he, no, longer, believed, in, a, very, high, degree, of, national, specialisation, and, refused, to, abandon, any, industry, which, is, unable, for, the, moment, to, survive, he, also, criticised, the, static, dimension, of, the, theory, of, comparative, advantage, which, in, his, view, by, fixing, comparative, advantages, definitively, led, in, practice, to, a, waste, of, national, resources, in, the, daily, mail, of, 13, march, 1931, he, called, the, assumption, of, perfect, sectoral, labour, mobility, nonsense, since, it, states, that, a, person, made, unemployed, contributes, to, a, reduction, in, the, wage, rate, until, he, finds, a, job, but, for, keynes, this, change, of, job, may, involve, costs, job, search, training, and, is, not, always, possible, generally, speaking, for, keynes, the, assumptions, of, full, employment, and, automatic, return, to, equilibrium, discredit, the, theory, of, comparative, advantage, in, july, 1933, he, published, an, article, in, the, new, statesman, and, nation, entitled, national, self, sufficiency, in, which, he, criticised, the, argument, of, the, specialisation, of, economies, which, is, the, basis, of, free, trade, he, thus, proposed, the, search, for, a, certain, degree, of, self, sufficiency, instead, of, the, specialisation, of, economies, advocated, by, the, ricardian, theory, of, comparative, advantage, he, prefers, the, maintenance, of, a, diversity, of, activities, for, nations, in, it, he, refutes, the, principle, of, peacemaking, trade, his, vision, of, trade, became, that, of, a, system, where, foreign, capitalists, compete, for, new, markets, he, defends, the, idea, of, producing, on, national, soil, when, possible, and, reasonable, and, expresses, sympathy, for, the, advocates, of, protectionism, he, notes, in, national, self, sufficiency, a, considerable, degree, of, international, specialization, is, necessary, in, a, rational, world, in, all, cases, where, it, is, dictated, by, wide, differences, of, climate, natural, resources, native, aptitudes, level, of, culture, and, density, of, population, but, over, an, increasingly, wide, range, of, industrial, products, and, perhaps, of, agricultural, products, also, i, have, become, doubtful, whether, the, economic, loss, of, national, self, sufficiency, is, great, enough, to, outweigh, the, other, advantages, of, gradually, bringing, the, product, and, the, consumer, within, the, ambit, of, the, same, national, economic, and, financial, organization, experience, accumulates, to, prove, that, most, modern, processes, of, mass, production, can, be, performed, in, most, countries, and, climates, with, almost, equal, efficiency, he, also, writes, in, national, self, sufficiency, i, sympathize, therefore, with, those, who, would, minimize, rather, than, with, those, who, would, maximize, economic, entanglement, among, nations, ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel, these, are, the, things, which, should, of, their, nature, be, international, but, let, goods, be, homespun, whenever, it, is, reasonably, and, conveniently, possible, and, above, all, let, finance, be, primarily, national, later, keynes, had, a, written, correspondence, with, james, meade, centred, on, the, issue, of, import, restrictions, keynes, and, meade, discussed, the, best, choice, between, quota, and, tariff, in, march, 1944, keynes, began, a, discussion, with, marcus, fleming, after, the, latter, had, written, an, article, entitled, quotas, versus, depreciation, on, this, occasion, we, see, that, he, has, definitely, taken, a, protectionist, stance, after, the, great, depression, he, considered, that, quotas, could, be, more, effective, than, currency, depreciation, in, dealing, with, external, imbalances, thus, for, keynes, currency, depreciation, was, no, longer, sufficient, and, protectionist, measures, became, necessary, to, avoid, trade, deficits, to, avoid, the, return, of, crises, due, to, a, self, regulating, economic, system, it, seemed, essential, to, him, to, regulate, trade, and, stop, free, trade, deregulation, of, foreign, trade, he, points, out, that, countries, that, import, more, than, they, export, weaken, their, economies, when, the, trade, deficit, increases, unemployment, rises, and, gross, domestic, product, gdp, slows, down, furthermore, surplus, countries, exert, a, negative, externality, on, their, trading, partners, they, get, richer, at, the, expense, of, others, and, destroy, the, output, of, their, trading, partners, john, maynard, keynes, believed, that, the, products, of, surplus, countries, should, be, taxed, to, avoid, trade, imbalances, keynes, was, the, principal, author, of, a, proposal, the, so, called, keynes, plan, for, an, international, clearing, union, the, two, governing, principles, of, the, plan, were, that, the, problem, of, settling, outstanding, balances, should, be, solved, by, creating, additional, international, money, and, that, debtor, and, creditor, should, be, treated, almost, alike, as, disturbers, of, equilibrium, in, the, event, though, the, plans, were, rejected, in, part, because, american, opinion, was, naturally, reluctant, to, accept, the, principle, of, equality, of, treatment, so, novel, in, debtor, creditor, relationships, the, new, system, is, not, founded, on, free, trade, liberalisation, of, foreign, trade, but, rather, on, the, regulation, of, international, trade, to, eliminate, trade, imbalances, the, nations, with, a, surplus, would, have, an, incentive, to, reduce, it, and, in, doing, so, they, would, automatically, clear, other, nations, deficits, he, proposed, a, global, bank, that, would, issue, its, currency, the, bancor, which, was, exchangeable, with, national, currencies, at, fixed, rates, of, exchange, and, would, become, the, unit, of, account, between, nations, which, means, it, would, be, used, to, measure, a, country, s, trade, deficit, or, trade, surplus, every, country, would, have, an, overdraft, facility, in, its, bancor, account, at, the, international, clearing, union, he, pointed, out, that, surpluses, lead, to, weak, global, aggregate, demand, countries, running, surpluses, exert, a, negative, externality, on, trading, partners, and, pose, far, more, than, those, in, deficit, a, threat, to, global, prosperity, in, his, 1933, yale, review, article, national, self, sufficiency, he, already, highlighted, the, problems, created, by, free, trade, his, view, supported, by, many, economists, and, commentators, at, the, time, was, that, creditor, nations, may, be, just, as, responsible, as, debtor, nations, for, disequilibrium, in, exchanges, and, that, both, should, be, under, an, obligation, to, bring, trade, back, into, a, state, of, balance, failure, for, them, to, do, so, could, have, serious, consequences, in, the, words, of, geoffrey, crowther, then, editor, of, the, economist, if, the, economic, relationships, between, nations, are, not, by, one, means, or, another, brought, fairly, close, to, balance, then, there, is, no, set, of, financial, arrangements, that, can, rescue, the, world, from, the, impoverishing, results, of, chaos, these, ideas, were, informed, by, events, prior, to, the, great, depression, when, in, the, opinion, of, keynes, and, others, international, lending, primarily, by, the, us, exceeded, the, capacity, of, sound, investment, and, so, got, diverted, into, non, productive, and, speculative, uses, which, in, turn, invited, default, and, a, sudden, stop, to, the, process, of, lending, influenced, by, keynes, economics, texts, in, the, immediate, post, war, period, put, a, significant, emphasis, on, balance, in, trade, for, example, the, second, edition, of, the, popular, introductory, textbook, an, outline, of, money, devoted, the, last, three, of, its, ten, chapters, to, questions, of, foreign, exchange, management, and, in, particular, the, problem, of, balance, however, in, more, recent, years, since, the, end, of, the, bretton, woods, system, in, 1971, with, the, increasing, influence, of, monetarist, schools, of, thought, in, the, 1980s, and, particularly, in, the, face, of, large, sustained, trade, imbalances, these, concerns, and, particularly, concerns, about, the, destabilising, effects, of, large, trade, surpluses, have, largely, disappeared, from, mainstream, economics, discourse, and, keynes, s, insights, have, slipped, from, view, they, are, receiving, some, attention, again, in, the, wake, of, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 08, keynes, s, early, romantic, and, sexual, relationships, were, exclusively, with, men, keynes, had, been, in, relationships, while, at, eton, and, cambridge, significant, among, these, early, partners, were, dilly, knox, and, daniel, macmillan, keynes, was, open, about, his, affairs, and, from, 1901, to, 1915, kept, separate, diaries, in, which, he, tabulated, his, many, sexual, encounters, keynes, s, relationship, and, later, close, friendship, with, macmillan, was, to, be, fortunate, as, macmillan, s, company, first, published, his, tract, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, attitudes, in, the, bloomsbury, group, in, which, keynes, was, avidly, involved, were, relaxed, about, homosexuality, keynes, together, with, writer, lytton, strachey, had, reshaped, the, victorian, attitudes, of, the, cambridge, apostles, since, time, homosexual, relations, among, the, members, were, for, a, time, common, wrote, bertrand, russell, the, artist, duncan, grant, has, been, described, as, the, supreme, male, love, of, keynes, s, life, and, their, sexual, relationship, lasted, from, 1908, to, 1915, keynes, was, also, involved, with, lytton, strachey, though, they, were, for, the, most, part, love, rivals, rather, than, lovers, keynes, had, won, the, affections, of, arthur, hobhouse, and, as, with, grant, fell, out, with, a, jealous, strachey, over, it, strachey, had, previously, found, himself, put, off, by, keynes, not, least, because, of, his, manner, of, treat, his, love, affairs, statistically, political, opponents, have, used, keynes, s, sexuality, to, attack, his, academic, work, one, line, of, attack, held, that, he, was, uninterested, in, the, long, term, ramifications, of, his, theories, because, he, had, no, children, donald, kagan, in, on, the, origins, of, war, quotes, sally, marks, and, stephen, a, schuker, to, suggest, that, passion, for, carl, melchior, distorted, his, position, in, favor, of, germany, keynes, s, friends, in, the, bloomsbury, group, were, initially, surprised, when, in, his, later, years, he, began, pursuing, affairs, with, women, demonstrating, himself, to, be, bisexual, ray, costelloe, who, later, married, oliver, strachey, was, an, early, heterosexual, interest, of, keynes, in, 1906, keynes, had, written, of, this, infatuation, that, i, seem, to, have, fallen, in, love, with, ray, a, little, bit, but, as, she, isn, t, male, i, haven, t, able, to, think, of, any, suitable, steps, to, take, in, 1921, keynes, wrote, that, he, had, fallen, very, much, in, love, with, lydia, lopokova, a, well, known, russian, ballerina, and, one, of, the, stars, of, sergei, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, in, the, early, years, of, his, courtship, he, maintained, an, affair, with, a, younger, man, sebastian, sprott, in, tandem, with, lopokova, but, eventually, chose, lopokova, exclusively, they, were, married, in, 1925, with, keynes, s, former, lover, duncan, grant, as, best, man, what, a, marriage, of, beauty, and, brains, the, fair, lopokova, and, john, maynard, keynes, was, said, at, the, time, keynes, later, commented, to, strachey, that, beauty, and, intelligence, were, rarely, found, in, the, same, person, and, that, only, in, duncan, grant, had, he, found, the, combination, the, union, was, happy, with, biographer, peter, clarke, writing, that, the, marriage, gave, keynes, a, new, focus, a, new, emotional, stability, and, a, sheer, delight, of, which, he, never, wearied, the, couple, hoped, to, have, children, but, this, did, not, happen, among, keynes, s, bloomsbury, friends, lopokova, was, at, least, initially, subjected, to, criticism, for, her, manners, mode, of, conversation, and, supposedly, humble, social, origins, the, last, of, the, ostensible, causes, being, particularly, noted, in, the, letters, of, vanessa, and, clive, bell, and, virginia, woolf, in, her, novel, mrs, dalloway, 1925, woolf, bases, the, character, of, rezia, warren, smith, on, lopokova, e, m, forster, later, wrote, in, contrition, about, lydia, keynes, every, whose, word, should, be, recorded, how, we, all, used, to, underestimate, her, keynes, had, no, children, and, his, wife, outlived, him, by, 35, years, dying, in, 1981, keynes, thought, that, the, pursuit, of, money, for, its, own, sake, was, a, pathological, condition, and, that, the, proper, aim, of, work, is, to, provide, leisure, he, wanted, shorter, working, hours, and, longer, holidays, for, all, keynes, was, interested, in, literature, in, general, and, drama, in, particular, and, supported, the, cambridge, arts, theatre, financially, which, allowed, the, institution, to, become, one, of, the, major, british, stages, outside, london, keynes, s, interest, in, classical, opera, and, dance, led, him, to, support, the, royal, opera, house, at, covent, garden, and, the, ballet, company, at, sadler, s, wells, during, the, war, as, a, member, of, cema, council, for, the, encouragement, of, music, and, the, arts, keynes, helped, secure, government, funds, to, maintain, both, companies, while, their, venues, were, shut, following, the, war, keynes, was, instrumental, in, establishing, the, arts, council, of, great, britain, and, was, its, founding, chairman, in, 1946, from, the, start, the, two, organisations, that, received, the, largest, grants, from, the, new, body, were, the, royal, opera, house, and, sadler, s, wells, keynes, built, up, a, substantial, collection, of, fine, art, including, works, by, paul, c, zanne, edgar, degas, amedeo, modigliani, georges, braque, pablo, picasso, and, georges, seurat, some, of, which, can, now, be, seen, at, the, fitzwilliam, museum, he, enjoyed, collecting, books, he, collected, and, protected, many, of, isaac, newton, s, papers, in, part, on, the, basis, of, these, papers, keynes, wrote, of, newton, as, the, last, of, the, magicians, keynes, like, other, members, of, the, bloomsbury, group, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, philosophy, of, g, e, moore, which, in, 1938, he, described, as, still, my, religion, under, the, surface, according, to, moore, states, of, mind, were, the, only, valuable, things, in, themselves, the, most, important, being, the, pleasures, of, human, intercourse, and, the, enjoyment, of, beautiful, objects, virginia, woolf, s, biographer, tells, an, anecdote, of, how, virginia, woolf, keynes, and, t, s, eliot, discussed, religion, at, a, dinner, party, in, the, context, of, their, struggle, against, victorian, era, morality, keynes, may, have, been, confirmed, but, according, to, cambridge, university, he, was, clearly, an, agnostic, which, he, remained, until, his, death, according, to, one, biographer, he, was, never, able, to, take, religion, seriously, regarding, it, as, a, strange, aberration, of, the, human, mind, but, also, added, that, he, came, to, value, it, for, social, and, moral, reasons, later, in, life, another, biographer, writes, that, he, broke, the, family, faith, and, became, a, ferocious, agnostic, during, his, time, at, eton, one, cambridge, acquaintance, remembered, him, as, an, atheist, with, a, devotion, to, king, s, chapel, at, cambridge, he, was, strongly, associated, with, the, cambridge, heretics, society, an, avowed, atheist, group, which, promoted, secularism, and, humanism, keynes, was, ultimately, a, successful, investor, building, up, a, private, fortune, his, assets, were, nearly, wiped, out, following, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, which, he, did, not, foresee, but, he, soon, recouped, at, keynes, s, death, in, 1946, his, net, worth, stood, just, short, of, 500, 000, equivalent, to, about, 20, 5, million, 27, 1, million, in, 2018, the, sum, had, been, amassed, despite, lavish, support, for, various, charities, and, philanthropies, and, despite, his, ethical, reluctance, to, sell, on, a, falling, market, in, cases, where, he, saw, such, behaviour, as, likely, to, deepen, a, slump, keynes, managed, the, endowment, of, king, s, college, cambridge, starting, in, the, 1920s, initially, with, an, unsuccessful, strategy, based, on, market, timing, but, later, shifting, to, focus, in, the, publicly, traded, stock, of, small, and, medium, sized, companies, that, paid, large, dividends, this, was, a, controversial, decision, at, the, time, as, stocks, were, considered, high, risk, and, the, centuries, old, endowment, had, traditionally, been, invested, in, agricultural, land, and, fixed, income, assets, like, bonds, keynes, was, granted, permission, to, invest, a, small, minority, of, assets, in, stocks, and, his, adroit, management, resulted, this, portion, of, the, endowment, growing, to, become, the, majority, of, the, endowment, s, assets, the, active, component, of, his, portfolio, outperformed, a, british, equity, index, by, an, average, of, 6, to, 8, a, year, over, a, quarter, century, earning, him, a, favourable, mention, by, later, investors, such, as, warren, buffett, and, george, soros, joel, tillinghast, of, fidelity, investments, describes, keynes, as, an, early, practitioner, of, value, investing, a, school, of, thought, formalised, in, the, us, by, benjamin, graham, and, david, dodd, at, columbia, business, school, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, however, keynes, is, believed, to, have, developed, his, ideas, independently, keynes, is, also, regarded, as, a, pioneer, of, financial, diversification, as, he, recognised, the, importance, of, holding, assets, with, opposed, risks, as, he, wrote, since, they, are, likely, to, move, in, opposite, directions, when, there, are, general, fluctuations, and, also, as, an, early, international, investor, who, avoided, home, country, bias, by, investing, substantially, in, stocks, outside, the, united, kingdom, ken, fisher, characterised, keynes, as, an, exception, to, the, rule, that, economists, usually, make, horrible, investors, keynes, joined, the, board, of, the, national, mutual, life, assurance, society, in, 1919, and, served, as, chairman, from, 1921, to, 1938, keynes, introduced, a, policy, of, active, trading, of, fixed, interest, stocks, coupled, with, investment, in, equities, keynes, was, the, first, to, give, the, seal, of, respectability, and, to, apply, it, to, a, life, assurance, fund, olivier, accominotti, and, david, chambers, have, pointed, out, that, keynes, did, not, make, use, of, currency, trading, and, the, carry, trade, in, his, investments, keynes, understood, the, strategy, however, but, considered, that, in, his, time, the, separation, of, the, interest, rates, was, not, sufficient, to, pay, for, the, costs, of, transporting, the, capital, as, gold, as, he, explained, to, the, macmillan, committee, of, 1930, keynes, was, a, lifelong, member, of, the, liberal, party, which, until, the, 1920s, had, been, one, of, the, two, main, political, parties, in, the, united, kingdom, and, as, late, as, 1916, had, often, been, the, dominant, power, in, government, keynes, had, helped, campaign, for, the, liberals, at, elections, from, about, 1906, yet, he, always, refused, to, run, for, office, himself, despite, being, asked, to, do, so, on, three, separate, occasions, in, 1920, from, 1926, when, lloyd, george, became, leader, of, the, liberals, keynes, took, a, major, role, in, defining, the, party, s, economic, policy, but, by, then, the, liberals, had, been, displaced, into, third, party, status, by, the, growing, workers, oriented, labour, party, in, 1939, keynes, had, the, option, to, enter, parliament, as, an, independent, mp, with, the, university, of, cambridge, seat, a, by, election, for, the, seat, was, to, be, held, due, to, the, illness, of, an, elderly, tory, and, the, master, of, magdalene, college, had, obtained, agreement, that, none, of, the, major, parties, would, field, a, candidate, if, keynes, chose, to, stand, keynes, declined, the, invitation, as, he, felt, he, would, wield, greater, influence, on, events, if, he, remained, a, free, agent, keynes, was, a, proponent, of, eugenics, he, served, as, director, of, the, british, eugenics, society, from, 1937, to, 1944, as, late, as, 1946, shortly, before, his, death, keynes, declared, eugenics, to, be, the, most, important, significant, and, i, would, add, genuine, branch, of, sociology, which, exists, keynes, once, remarked, that, the, youth, had, no, religion, save, communism, and, this, was, worse, than, nothing, marxism, was, founded, upon, nothing, better, than, a, misunderstanding, of, ricardo, and, given, time, he, keynes, would, deal, thoroughly, with, the, marxists, and, other, economists, to, solve, the, economic, problems, their, theories, threaten, to, cause, in, 1925, keynes, said, the, class, war, will, find, me, on, the, side, of, the, educated, bourgeoisie, in, 1931, keynes, had, the, following, to, say, on, leninism, how, can, i, accept, a, doctrine, which, sets, up, as, its, bible, above, and, beyond, criticism, an, obsolete, textbook, which, i, know, not, only, to, be, scientifically, erroneous, but, without, interest, or, application, to, the, modern, world, how, can, i, adopt, a, creed, which, preferring, the, mud, to, the, fish, exalts, the, boorish, proletariat, above, the, bourgeoisie, and, the, intelligentsia, who, with, all, their, faults, are, the, quality, of, life, and, surely, carry, the, seeds, of, all, human, achievement, even, if, we, need, a, religion, how, can, we, find, it, in, the, turbid, rubbish, of, the, red, bookshop, it, is, hard, for, an, educated, decent, intelligent, son, of, western, europe, to, find, his, ideals, here, unless, he, has, first, suffered, some, strange, and, horrid, process, of, conversion, which, has, changed, all, his, values, keynes, was, a, firm, supporter, of, women, s, rights, and, in, 1932, became, vice, chairman, of, the, marie, stopes, society, which, provided, birth, control, education, he, also, campaigned, against, job, discrimination, against, women, and, unequal, pay, he, was, an, outspoken, campaigner, for, reform, of, the, laws, against, homosexuality, throughout, his, life, keynes, worked, energetically, for, the, benefit, both, of, the, public, and, his, friends, even, when, his, health, was, poor, he, laboured, to, sort, out, the, finances, of, his, old, college, helping, to, set, up, the, bretton, woods, system, he, worked, to, institute, an, international, monetary, system, that, would, be, beneficial, for, the, world, economy, in, 1946, keynes, suffered, a, series, of, heart, attacks, which, ultimately, proved, fatal, they, began, during, negotiations, for, the, anglo, american, loan, in, savannah, georgia, where, he, was, trying, to, secure, favourable, terms, for, the, united, kingdom, from, the, united, states, a, process, he, described, as, absolute, hell, a, few, weeks, after, returning, from, the, united, states, keynes, died, of, a, heart, attack, at, tilton, his, farmhouse, home, near, firle, east, sussex, england, on, 21, april, 1946, at, the, age, of, 62, against, his, wishes, he, wanted, his, ashes, to, be, deposited, in, the, crypt, at, king, s, his, ashes, were, scattered, on, the, downs, above, tilton, both, of, keynes, s, parents, outlived, him, his, father,
