senghor, compiled, and, edited, a, volume, of, francophone, poetry, called, anthologie, de, la, nouvelle, po, sie, n, gre, et, malgache, for, which, jean, paul, sartre, wrote, an, introduction, entitled, orph, e, noir, black, orpheus, for, his, epitaph, was, a, poem, he, had, written, namely, with, aim, c, saire, and, l, on, damas, senghor, created, the, concept, of, n, gritude, an, important, intellectual, movement, that, sought, to, assert, and, valorise, what, they, believed, to, be, distinctive, african, characteristics, values, and, aesthetics, one, of, these, african, characteristics, that, senghor, theorised, was, asserted, when, he, wrote, the, negro, has, reactions, that, are, more, lived, in, the, sense, that, they, are, more, direct, and, concrete, expressions, of, the, sensation, and, of, the, stimulus, and, so, of, the, object, itself, with, all, its, original, qualities, and, power, this, was, a, reaction, against, the, too, strong, dominance, of, french, culture, in, the, colonies, and, against, the, perception, that, africa, did, not, have, a, culture, developed, enough, to, stand, alongside, that, of, europe, in, that, respect, n, gritude, owes, significantly, to, the, pioneering, work, of, leo, frobenius, building, upon, historical, research, identifying, ancient, egypt, with, black, africa, senghor, argued, that, sub, saharan, africa, and, europe, are, in, fact, part, of, the, same, cultural, continuum, reaching, from, egypt, to, classical, greece, through, rome, to, the, european, colonial, powers, of, the, modern, age, n, gritude, was, by, no, means, as, it, has, in, many, quarters, been, perceived, an, anti, white, racism, but, rather, emphasised, the, importance, of, dialogue, and, exchange, among, different, cultures, e, g, european, african, arab, etc, a, related, concept, later, developed, in, mobutu, s, zaire, is, that, of, authenticit, or, authenticity, in, colloquial, french, the, term, d, calage, is, used, to, describe, jetlag, lag, or, a, general, discrepancy, between, two, things, however, senghor, uses, the, term, to, describe, the, unevenness, in, the, african, diaspora, the, complete, phrase, he, uses, is, il, s, agit, en, r, alit, d, un, simple, d, calage, dans, le, temps, et, dans, l, espace, meaning, that, between, black, africans, and, african, americans, there, exists, an, inconsistency, both, temporally, and, spatially, the, time, element, points, to, the, advancing, or, delaying, of, a, schedule, or, agenda, while, the, space, aspect, designates, the, displacing, and, shifting, of, an, object, the, term, points, to, a, bias, that, refuses, to, pass, over, when, one, crosses, the, water, he, asks, how, can, we, expect, any, sort, of, solidarity, or, intimacy, from, two, populations, that, diverged, over, 500, years, ago
