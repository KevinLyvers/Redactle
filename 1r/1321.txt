created, by, libya, s, growing, urbanization, the, health, sector, was, also, expanded, by, 1978, libya, had, 50, per, cent, more, hospitals, than, it, had, in, 1968, while, the, number, of, doctors, had, increased, from, 700, to, over, 3000, in, that, decade, malaria, was, eradicated, and, trachoma, and, tuberculosis, greatly, curtailed, compulsory, education, was, expanded, from, 6, to, 9, years, while, adult, literacy, programs, and, free, university, education, were, introduced, beida, university, was, founded, while, tripoli, university, and, benghazi, university, were, expanded, in, doing, so, the, government, helped, to, integrate, the, poorer, strata, of, libyan, society, into, the, education, system, through, these, measures, the, rcc, greatly, expanded, the, public, sector, providing, employment, for, thousands, these, early, social, programs, proved, popular, within, libya, this, popularity, was, partly, due, to, gaddafi, s, personal, charisma, youth, and, underdog, status, as, a, bedouin, as, well, as, his, rhetoric, emphasizing, his, role, as, the, successor, to, the, anti, italian, fighter, omar, mukhtar, to, combat, the, country, s, strong, regional, and, tribal, divisions, the, rcc, promoted, the, idea, of, a, unified, pan, libyan, identity, in, doing, so, they, tried, discrediting, tribal, leaders, as, agents, of, the, old, regime, and, in, august, 1971, a, sabha, military, court, tried, many, of, them, for, counter, revolutionary, activity, long, standing, administrative, boundaries, were, re, drawn, crossing, tribal, boundaries, while, pro, revolutionary, modernizers, replaced, traditional, leaders, yet, the, communities, they, served, often, rejected, them, realizing, the, failures, of, the, modernizers, gaddafi, created, the, arab, socialist, union, asu, in, june, 1971, a, mass, mobilization, vanguard, party, of, which, he, was, president, the, asu, recognized, the, rcc, as, its, supreme, leading, authority, and, was, designed, to, further, revolutionary, enthusiasm, throughout, the, country, it, remained, heavily, bureaucratic, and, failed, to, mobilize, mass, support, in, the, way, gaddafi, had, envisioned, the, influence, of, nasser, s, arab, nationalism, over, the, rcc, was, immediately, apparent, the, administration, was, instantly, recognized, by, the, neighbouring, arab, nationalist, regimes, in, egypt, syria, iraq, and, sudan, with, egypt, sending, experts, to, aid, the, inexperienced, rcc, gaddafi, propounded, pan, arab, ideas, proclaiming, the, need, for, a, single, arab, state, stretching, across, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, in, december, 1969, libya, signed, the, tripoli, charter, alongside, egypt, and, sudan, this, established, the, arab, revolutionary, front, a, pan, national, union, designed, as, a, first, step, towards, the, eventual, political, unification, of, the, three, nations, in, 1970, syria, declared, its, intention, to, join, nasser, died, unexpectedly, in, september, 1970, with, gaddafi, playing, a, prominent, role, at, his, funeral, nasser, was, succeeded, by, anwar, sadat, who, suggested, that, rather, than, creating, a, unified, state, the, arab, states, should, create, a, political, federation, implemented, in, april, 1971, in, doing, so, egypt, syria, and, sudan, received, large, grants, of, libyan, oil, money, in, july, 1971, gaddafi, sided, with, sadat, against, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1971, sudanese, coup, d, tat, and, dispatched, libyan, fighter, jets, to, force, down, a, british, airlines, jetliner, carrying, the, leading, coup, plotters, farouk, osman, hamadallah, and, babikir, al, nour, they, were, extradited, back, to, khartoum, where, they, were, promptly, executed, by, sudanese, leader, jaafar, nimeiry, in, february, 1972, gaddafi, and, sadat, signed, an, unofficial, charter, of, merger, but, it, was, never, implemented, because, relations, broke, down, the, following, year, sadat, became, increasingly, wary, of, libya, s, radical, direction, and, the, september, 1973, deadline, for, implementing, the, federation, passed, by, with, no, action, taken, after, the, 1969, coup, representatives, of, the, four, powers, france, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, were, called, to, meet, rcc, representatives, the, uk, and, the, us, quickly, extended, diplomatic, recognition, hoping, to, secure, the, position, of, their, military, bases, in, libya, and, fearing, further, instability, hoping, to, ingratiate, themselves, with, gaddafi, in, 1970, the, us, informed, him, of, at, least, one, planned, counter, coup, such, attempts, to, form, a, working, relationship, with, the, rcc, failed, gaddafi, was, determined, to, reassert, national, sovereignty, and, expunge, what, he, described, as, foreign, colonial, and, imperialist, influences, his, administration, insisted, that, the, us, and, the, uk, remove, their, military, bases, from, libya, with, gaddafi, proclaiming, that, the, armed, forces, which, rose, to, express, the, people, s, revolution, tolerate, living, in, their, shacks, while, the, bases, of, imperialism, exist, in, libyan, territory, the, british, left, in, march, and, the, americans, in, june, 1970, moving, to, reduce, italian, influence, in, october, 1970, all, italian, owned, assets, were, expropriated, and, the, 12, 000, strong, italian, community, was, expelled, from, libya, alongside, the, smaller, community, of, libyan, jews, the, day, became, a, national, holiday, known, as, vengeance, day, italy, complained, that, this, was, in, contravention, of, the, 1956, italo, libyan, treaty, although, no, un, sanctions, were, forthcoming, aiming, to, reduce, nato, power, in, the, mediterranean, in, 1971, libya, requested, that, malta, cease, allowing, nato, to, use, its, land, for, a, military, base, in, turn, offering, malta, foreign, aid, compromising, malta, s, government, continued, allowing, nato, to, use, the, island, but, only, on, the, condition, that, nato, would, not, use, it, for, launching, attacks, on, arab, territory, over, the, coming, decade, gaddafi, s, government, developed, stronger, political, and, economic, links, with, dom, mintoff, s, maltese, administration, and, under, libya, s, urging, malta, did, not, renew, the, uk, s, airbases, on, the, island, in, 1980, orchestrating, a, military, build, up, the, rcc, began, purchasing, weapons, from, france, and, the, soviet, union, the, commercial, relationship, with, the, latter, led, to, an, increasingly, strained, relationship, with, the, us, which, was, then, engaged, in, the, cold, war, with, the, soviets, gaddafi, was, especially, critical, of, the, us, due, to, its, support, of, israel, and, sided, with, the, palestinians, in, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, viewing, the, 1948, creation, of, the, state, of, israel, as, a, western, colonial, occupation, forced, upon, the, arab, world, he, believed, that, palestinian, violence, against, israeli, and, western, targets, was, the, justified, response, of, an, oppressed, people, who, were, fighting, against, the, colonization, of, their, homeland, calling, on, the, arab, states, to, wage, continuous, war, against, israel, in, 1970, he, initiated, a, jihad, fund, to, finance, anti, israeli, militants, in, june, 1972, gaddafi, created, the, first, nasserite, volunteers, centre, to, train, anti, israeli, guerrillas, like, nasser, gaddafi, favoured, the, palestinian, leader, yasser, arafat, and, his, group, fatah, over, more, militant, and, marxist, palestinian, groups, as, the, years, progressed, however, gaddafi, s, relationship, with, arafat, became, strained, with, gaddafi, considering, him, too, moderate, and, calling, for, more, violent, action, instead, he, supported, militias, like, the, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, general, command, the, democratic, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, as, sa, iqa, the, palestinian, popular, struggle, front, and, the, abu, nidal, organization, he, funded, the, black, september, organization, whose, members, perpetrated, the, 1972, munich, massacre, of, israeli, athletes, in, west, germany, and, had, the, killed, militants, bodies, flown, to, libya, for, a, hero, s, funeral, gaddafi, financially, supported, other, militant, groups, across, the, world, including, the, black, panther, party, the, nation, of, islam, the, almighty, black, p, stone, nation, the, tupamaros, the, 19th, of, april, movement, and, the, sandinista, national, liberation, front, in, nicaragua, the, anc, among, other, liberation, movements, in, the, fight, against, apartheid, in, south, africa, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, eta, action, directe, the, red, brigades, and, the, red, army, faction, in, europe, and, the, armenian, secret, army, the, japanese, red, army, the, free, aceh, movement, and, the, moro, national, liberation, front, in, the, philippines, gaddafi, was, indiscriminate, in, the, causes, which, he, funded, sometimes, switching, from, supporting, one, side, in, a, conflict, to, the, other, as, in, the, eritrean, war, of, independence, throughout, the, 1970s, these, groups, received, financial, support, from, libya, which, came, to, be, seen, as, a, leader, in, the, third, world, s, struggle, against, colonialism, and, neocolonialism, though, many, of, these, groups, were, labelled, terrorists, by, critics, of, their, activities, gaddafi, rejected, this, characterization, instead, considering, them, to, be, revolutionaries, who, were, engaged, in, liberation, struggles, on, 16, april, 1973, gaddafi, proclaimed, the, start, of, a, popular, revolution, in, a, speech, at, zuwarah, he, initiated, this, with, a, five, point, plan, the, first, point, of, which, dissolved, all, existing, laws, to, be, replaced, by, revolutionary, enactments, the, second, point, proclaimed, that, all, opponents, of, the, revolution, had, to, be, removed, while, the, third, initiated, an, administrative, revolution, that, gaddafi, proclaimed, would, remove, all, traces, of, bureaucracy, and, the, bourgeoisie, the, fourth, point, announced, that, the, population, must, form, people, s, committees, and, be, armed, to, defend, the, revolution, while, the, fifth, proclaimed, the, beginning, of, the, cultural, revolution, in, libya, to, expunge, the, country, of, poisonous, foreign, influences, he, began, to, lecture, on, this, new, phase, of, the, revolution, in, libya, egypt, and, france, as, a, process, it, had, many, similarities, with, the, cultural, revolution, implemented, in, china, as, part, of, this, popular, revolution, gaddafi, invited, libya, s, people, to, found, general, people, s, committees, as, conduits, for, raising, political, consciousness, although, offering, little, guidance, for, how, to, set, up, these, councils, gaddafi, claimed, that, they, would, offer, a, form, of, direct, political, participation, that, was, more, democratic, than, a, traditional, party, based, representative, system, he, hoped, that, the, councils, would, mobilize, the, people, behind, the, rcc, erode, the, power, of, the, traditional, leaders, and, the, bureaucracy, and, allow, for, a, new, legal, system, chosen, by, the, people, many, such, committees, were, established, in, schools, and, colleges, where, they, were, responsible, for, vetting, staff, courses, and, textbooks, to, determine, if, they, were, compatible, with, the, country, s, revolutionary, ideology, the, people, s, committees, led, to, a, high, percentage, of, public, involvement, in, decision, making, within, the, limits, permitted, by, the, rcc, but, exacerbated, tribal, divisions, and, tensions, they, also, served, as, a, surveillance, system, aiding, the, security, services, in, locating, individuals, with, views, critical, of, the, rcc, leading, to, the, arrest, of, ba, athists, marxists, and, islamists, operating, in, a, pyramid, structure, the, base, form, of, these, committees, were, local, working, groups, who, sent, elected, representatives, to, the, district, level, and, from, there, to, the, national, level, divided, between, the, general, people, s, congress, and, the, general, people, s, committee, above, these, remained, gaddafi, and, the, rcc, who, remained, responsible, for, all, major, decisions, in, crossing, regional, and, tribal, identities, the, committee, system, aided, national, integration, and, centralization, and, tightened, gaddafi, s, control, over, the, state, and, administrative, apparatus, in, june, 1973, gaddafi, created, a, political, ideology, as, a, basis, for, the, popular, revolution, third, international, theory, this, approach, regarded, both, the, us, and, the, soviet, union, as, imperialist, and, thus, rejected, western, capitalism, as, well, as, marxist, leninist, atheism, in, this, respect, it, was, similar, to, the, three, worlds, theory, developed, by, china, s, political, leader, mao, zedong, as, part, of, this, theory, gaddafi, praised, nationalism, as, a, progressive, force, and, advocated, the, creation, of, a, pan, arab, state, which, would, lead, the, islamic, and, third, worlds, against, imperialism, gaddafi, saw, islam, as, having, a, key, role, in, this, ideology, calling, for, an, islamic, revival, that, returned, to, the, origins, of, the, qur, an, rejecting, scholarly, interpretations, and, the, hadith, in, doing, so, he, angered, many, libyan, clerics, during, 1973, and, 1974, his, government, deepened, the, legal, reliance, on, sharia, for, instance, by, introducing, flogging, as, punishment, for, those, convicted, of, adultery, or, homosexual, activity, gaddafi, summarized, third, international, theory, in, three, short, volumes, published, between, 1975, and, 1979, collectively, known, as, the, green, book, volume, one, was, devoted, to, the, issue, of, democracy, outlining, the, flaws, of, representative, systems, in, favour, of, direct, participatory, gpcs, the, second, dealt, with, gaddafi, s, beliefs, regarding, socialism, while, the, third, explored, social, issues, regarding, the, family, and, the, tribe, while, the, first, two, volumes, advocated, radical, reform, the, third, adopted, a, socially, conservative, stance, proclaiming, that, while, men, and, women, were, equal, they, were, biologically, designed, for, different, roles, in, life, during, the, years, that, followed, gaddafists, adopted, quotes, from, the, green, book, such, as, representation, is, fraud, as, slogans, meanwhile, in, september, 1975, gaddafi, implemented, further, measures, to, increase, popular, mobilization, introducing, objectives, to, improve, the, relationship, between, the, councils, and, the, asu, in, 1975, gaddafi, s, government, declared, a, state, monopoly, on, foreign, trade, its, increasingly, radical, reforms, coupled, with, the, large, amount, of, oil, revenue, being, spent, on, foreign, causes, generated, discontent, in, libya, particularly, among, the, country, s, merchant, class, in, 1974, libya, saw, its, first, civilian, attack, on, gaddafi, s, government, when, a, benghazi, army, building, was, bombed, much, of, the, opposition, centred, around, rcc, member, umar, muhayshi, with, fellow, rcc, members, bashir, saghir, al, hawaadi, and, awad, ali, hamza, he, began, plotting, a, coup, against, gaddafi, in, 1975, their, plot, was, exposed, and, muhayshi, fled, to, tunisia, eventually, receiving, asylum, from, sadat, s, egypt, hawaadi, hamza, and, omar, el, hariri, were, arrested, most, of, the, other, conspirators, were, executed, in, march, 1976, another, rcc, member, foreign, minister, abdul, munim, al, huni, also, fled, to, egypt, in, the, aftermath, only, five, rcc, members, remained, gaddafi, jalloud, abu, bakr, yunis, jabr, mustafa, kharubi, and, kweldi, al, hamidi, thus, power, was, further, concentrated, in, gaddafi, s, hands, this, ultimately, led, to, the, rcc, s, official, abolition, in, march, 1977, in, september, 1975, gaddafi, purged, the, army, arresting, around, 200, senior, officers, and, in, october, he, founded, the, clandestine, office, for, the, security, of, the, revolution, in, april, 1976, he, called, upon, his, supporters, in, universities, to, establish, revolutionary, student, councils, and, drive, out, reactionary, elements, during, that, year, anti, gaddafist, student, demonstrations, broke, out, at, the, universities, of, tripoli, and, benghazi, resulting, in, clashes, with, both, gaddafist, students, and, police, the, rcc, responded, with, mass, arrests, and, introduced, compulsory, national, service, for, young, people, in, january, 1977, two, dissenting, students, and, a, number, of, army, officers, were, publicly, hanged, amnesty, international, condemned, it, as, the, first, time, in, gaddafist, libya, that, dissenters, had, been, executed, for, purely, political, crimes, dissent, also, arose, from, conservative, clerics, and, the, muslim, brotherhood, who, accused, gaddafi, of, moving, towards, marxism, and, criticized, his, abolition, of, private, property, as, being, against, the, islamic, sunnah, these, forces, were, then, persecuted, as, anti, revolutionary, while, all, privately, owned, islamic, colleges, and, universities, were, shut, down, following, anwar, sadat, s, ascension, to, the, egyptian, presidency, libya, s, relations, with, egypt,

to, sail, to, haifa, for, israel, s, 25th, anniversary, gaddafi, ordered, an, egyptian, submarine, to, target, the, ship, but, sadat, cancelled, the, order, fearing, a, military, escalation, gaddafi, was, later, infuriated, when, egypt, and, syria, planned, the, yom, kippur, war, against, israel, without, consulting, him, and, was, angered, when, egypt, conceded, to, peace, talks, rather, than, continuing, the, war, gaddafi, became, openly, hostile, to, egypt, s, leader, calling, for, sadat, s, overthrow, when, sudanese, president, gaafar, nimeiry, took, sadat, s, side, gaddafi, also, spoke,

libyan, soldiers, gaddafi, disavowed, haftar, and, the, other, prisoners, one, possible, contributing, factor, to, this, repudiation, may, have, been, that, gaddafi, had, signed, an, agreement, to,

revolutionary, theory, that, was, in, vogue, at, the, time, he, regarded, this, system, as, a, practical, alternative, to, the, then, dominant, international, models, of, western, capitalism, and, marxism, leninism, he, laid, out, the, principles, of, this, theory, in, the, three, volumes, of, the, green, book, in, which, he, sought, to, explain, the, structure, of, the, ideal, society, the, libyan, studies, specialist, ronald, bruce, st, john, regarded, arab, nationalism, as, gaddafi, s, primordial, value, stating, that, during, the, early, years, of, his, government, gaddafi, was, the, arab, nationalist, par, excellence, gaddafi, called, for, the, arab, world, to, regain, its, dignity, and, assert, a, major, place, on, the, world, stage, blaming, arab, backwardness, on, stagnation, resulting, from, ottoman, rule, european, colonialism, and, imperialism, and, corrupt, and, repressive, monarchies, gaddafi, s, arab, nationalist, views, led, him, to, the, pan, arabist, belief, in, the, need, for, unity, across, the, arab, world, combining, the, arab, nation, under, a, single, nation, state, to, this, end, he, had, proposed, a, political, union, with, five, neighbouring, arab, states, by, 1974, although, without, success, in, keeping, with, his, views, regarding, arabs, his, political, stance, was, described, as, nativist, gaddafi, also, had, international, ambitions, wanting, to, export, his, revolutionary, ideas, throughout, the, world, gaddafi, saw, his, socialist, jamahiriyah, as, a, model, for, the, arab, islamic, and, non, aligned, worlds, to, follow, and, in, his, speeches, declared, that, his, third, international, theory, would, eventually, guide, the, entire, planet, he, nevertheless, had, minimal, success, in, exporting, the, ideology, outside, of, libya, along, with, arab, nationalism, anti, imperialism, was, also, a, defining, feature, of, gaddafi, s, regime, during, its, early, years, he, believed, in, opposing, western, imperialism, and, colonialism, in, the, arab, world, including, any, western, expansionism, through, the, form, of, israel, he, offered, support, to, a, broad, range, of, political, groups, abroad, that, called, themselves, anti, imperialist, especially, those, that, set, themselves, in, opposition, to, the, united, states, for, many, years, anti, zionism, was, a, fundamental, component, of, gaddafi, s, ideology, he, believed, that, the, state, of, israel, should, not, exist, and, that, any, arab, compromise, with, the, israeli, government, was, a, betrayal, of, the, arab, people, in, large, part, due, to, their, support, of, israel, gaddafi, despised, the, united, states, considering, the, country, to, be, imperialist, and, lambasting, it, as, the, embodiment, of, evil, he, sought, to, distinguish, oriental, jews, who, had, lived, in, the, middle, east, for, generations, from, the, european, jews, who, had, migrated, to, palestine, during, the, 20th, century, calling, the, latter, vagabonds, and, mercenaries, who, should, return, to, europe, he, rallied, against, jews, in, many, of, his, speeches, with, blundy, and, lycett, claiming, that, his, antisemitism, was, almost, hitlerian, as, pan, africanism, increasingly, became, his, focus, in, the, early, 21st, century, gaddafi, became, less, interested, in, the, israel, palestine, issue, calling, for, the, two, communities, to, form, a, new, single, state, that, he, termed, isratin, this, would, have, led, the, jewish, population, to, become, a, minority, within, the, new, state, gaddafi, rejected, the, secularist, approach, to, arab, nationalism, that, had, been, pervasive, in, syria, with, his, revolutionary, movement, placing, a, far, stronger, emphasis, on, islam, than, previous, arab, nationalist, movements, had, done, he, deemed, arabism, and, islam, to, be, inseparable, referring, to, them, as, one, and, indivisible, and, called, on, the, arab, world, s, christian, minority, to, convert, to, islam, he, insisted, that, islamic, law, should, be, the, basis, for, the, law, of, the, state, blurring, any, distinction, between, the, religious, and, secular, realms, he, desired, unity, across, the, islamic, world, and, encouraged, the, propagation, of, the, faith, elsewhere, on, a, 2010, visit, to, italy, he, paid, a, modelling, agency, to, find, 200, young, italian, women, for, a, lecture, he, gave, urging, them, to, convert, according, to, the, gaddafi, biographer, jonathan, bearman, in, islamic, terms, gaddafi, was, a, modernist, rather, than, a, fundamentalist, for, he, subordinated, religion, to, the, political, system, rather, than, seeking, to, islamicise, the, state, as, islamists, sought, to, do, he, was, driven, by, a, sense, of, divine, mission, believing, himself, a, conduit, of, god, s, will, and, thought, that, he, must, achieve, his, goals, no, matter, what, the, cost, his, interpretation, of, islam, was, nevertheless, idiosyncratic, and, he, clashed, with, conservative, libyan, clerics, many, criticized, his, attempts, to, encourage, women, to, enter, traditionally, male, only, sectors, of, society, such, as, the, armed, forces, gaddafi, was, keen, to, improve, women, s, status, although, saw, the, sexes, as, separate, but, equal, and, therefore, felt, women, should, usually, remain, in, traditional, roles, the, purpose, of, the, socialist, society, is, the, happiness, of, man, which, can, only, be, realized, through, material, and, spiritual, freedom, attainment, of, such, freedom, depends, on, the, extent, of, man, s, ownership, of, his, needs, ownership, that, is, personal, and, sacredly, guaranteed, i, e, your, needs, must, neither, be, owned, by, somebody, else, nor, subject, to, plunder, by, any, part, of, society, muammar, gaddafi, gaddafi, described, his, approach, to, economics, as, islamic, socialism, for, him, a, socialist, society, could, be, defined, as, one, in, which, men, controlled, their, own, needs, either, through, personal, ownership, or, through, a, collective, although, the, early, policies, pursued, by, his, government, were, state, capitalist, in, orientation, by, 1978, he, believed, that, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, was, exploitative, and, thus, he, sought, to, move, libya, away, from, capitalism, and, towards, socialism, private, enterprise, was, largely, eliminated, in, favour, of, a, centrally, controlled, economy, the, extent, to, which, libya, became, socialist, under, gaddafi, is, disputed, bearman, suggested, that, while, libya, did, undergo, a, profound, social, revolution, he, did, not, think, that, a, socialist, society, was, established, in, libya, conversely, st, john, expressed, the, view, that, if, socialism, is, defined, as, a, redistribution, of, wealth, and, resources, a, socialist, revolution, clearly, occurred, in, libya, under, gaddafi, s, regime, gaddafi, was, staunchly, anti, marxist, and, in, 1973, declared, that, it, is, the, duty, of, every, muslim, to, combat, marxism, because, it, promotes, atheism, in, his, view, ideologies, like, marxism, and, zionism, were, alien, to, the, islamic, world, and, were, a, threat, to, the, ummah, or, global, islamic, community, nevertheless, blundy, and, lycett, noted, that, gaddafi, s, socialism, had, a, curiously, marxist, undertone, with, political, scientist, sami, hajjar, arguing, that, gaddafi, s, model, of, socialism, offered, a, simplification, of, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, s, theories, while, acknowledging, the, marxist, influence, on, gaddafi, s, thought, bearman, stated, that, the, libyan, leader, rejected, marxism, s, core, tenet, that, of, class, struggle, as, the, main, engine, of, social, development, instead, of, embracing, the, marxist, idea, that, a, socialist, society, emerged, from, class, struggle, between, the, proletariat, and, bourgeoisie, gaddafi, believed, that, socialism, would, be, achieved, through, overturning, unnatural, capitalism, and, returning, society, to, its, natural, equilibrium, in, this, he, sought, to, replace, a, capitalist, economy, with, one, based, on, his, own, romanticized, ideas, of, a, traditional, pre, capitalist, past, this, owed, much, to, the, islamic, belief, in, god, s, natural, law, providing, order, to, the, universe, a, very, private, individual, gaddafi, was, given, to, rumination, and, solitude, and, could, be, reclusive, gaddafi, described, himself, as, a, simple, revolutionary, and, pious, muslim, called, upon, by, god, to, continue, nasser, s, work, gaddafi, was, an, austere, and, devout, muslim, although, according, to, vandewalle, his, interpretation, of, islam, was, deeply, personal, and, idiosyncratic, he, was, also, a, football, enthusiast, and, enjoyed, both, playing, the, sport, and, horse, riding, as, a, means, of, recreation, he, regarded, himself, as, an, intellectual, he, was, a, fan, of, beethoven, and, said, his, favourite, novels, were, uncle, tom, s, cabin, roots, and, the, outsider, gaddafi, regarded, personal, appearance, as, important, with, blundy, and, lycett, referring, to, him, as, extraordinarily, vain, gaddafi, had, a, large, wardrobe, and, sometimes, changed, his, outfit, multiple, times, a, day, he, favoured, either, a, military, uniform, or, traditional, libyan, dress, tending, to, eschew, western, style, suits, he, saw, himself, as, a, fashion, icon, stating, whatever, i, wear, becomes, a, fad, i, wear, a, certain, shirt, and, suddenly, everyone, is, wearing, it, following, his, ascension, to, power, gaddafi, moved, into, the, bab, al, azizia, barracks, a, 6, square, kilometre, 2, 3, square, miles, fortified, compound, located, 3, 2, kilometres, 2, miles, from, the, centre, of, tripoli, in, the, 1980s, his, lifestyle, was, considered, modest, in, comparison, to, those, of, many, other, arab, leaders, he, was, preoccupied, with, his, own, security, regularly, changing, where, he, slept, and, sometimes, grounding, all, other, planes, in, libya, when, he, was, flying, he, made, particular, requests, when, travelling, to, foreign, countries, during, his, trips, to, rome, paris, madrid, moscow, and, new, york, city, he, resided, in, a, bulletproof, tent, following, his, bedouin, traditions, gaddafi, was, notably, confrontational, in, his, approach, to, foreign, powers, and, generally, shunned, western, ambassadors, and, diplomats, believing, them, to, be, spies, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, there, were, reports, of, his, making, sexual, advances, toward, female, reporters, and, members, of, his, entourage, starting, in, the, 1980s, he, travelled, with, his, all, female, amazonian, guard, who, were, allegedly, sworn, to, a, life, of, celibacy, after, gaddafi, s, death, the, libyan, psychologist, seham, sergewa, part, of, a, team, investigating, sexual, offences, during, the, civil, war, stated, that, five, of, the, guards, told, her, they, had, been, raped, by, gaddafi, and, senior, officials, after, gaddafi, s, death, the, french, journalist, annick, cojean, published, a, book, alleging, that, gaddafi, had, had, sexual, relations, with, women, some, in, their, early, teenage, years, who, had, been, specially, selected, for, him, one, of, those, cojean, interviewed, a, woman, named, soraya, claimed, that, gaddafi, kept, her, imprisoned, in, a, basement, for, six, years, where, he, repeatedly, raped, her, urinated, on, her, and, forced, her, to, watch, pornography, drink, alcohol, and, snort, cocaine, the, alleged, sexual, abuse, was, said, to, have, been, facilitated, by, gaddafi, s, chief, of, protocol, nuri, al, mismari, and, mabrouka, sherif, gaddafi, also, hired, several, ukrainian, nurses, to, care, for, him, one, described, him, as, kind, and, considerate, and, was, surprised, that, allegations, of, abuse, had, been, made, against, him, gaddafi, married, his, first, wife, fatiha, al, nuri, in, 1969, although, they, had, one, son, muhammad, gaddafi, born, 1970, their, relationship, was, strained, and, they, divorced, in, 1970, gaddafi, s, second, wife, was, safia, farkash, n, e, el,

children, hana, gaddafi, and, milad, gaddafi, several, of, his, sons, gained, a, reputation, for, lavish, and, anti, social, behaviour, in, libya, which, proved, a, source, of, resentment, toward, his, administration, at, least, three, of, his, cousins, were, prominent, figures, in, gaddafi, s, regime, ahmed, gaddaf, al, dam, is, libya, s, former, special, envoy, to, egypt, and, a, leading,

most, powerful, person, in, libya, in, the, 1980s, according, to, vandewalle, gaddafi, dominated, political, life, during, his, period, in, power, the, sociologist, raymond, a, hinnebusch, described, the, libyan, as, perhaps, the, most, exemplary, contemporary, case, of, the, politics, of, charismatic, leadership, displaying, all, of, the, traits, of, charismatic, authority, outlined, by, the, sociologist, max, weber, according, to, hinnebusch, the, foundations, of, gaddafi, s, personal, charismatic, authority, in, libya, stemmed, from, the, blessing, he, had, received, from, nasser, coupled, with, nationalist, achievements, such, as, the, expulsion, of, foreign, military, bases, the, extraction, of, higher, prices, for, libyan, oil, and, his, vocal, support, for, the, palestinian, and, other, anti, imperialist, causes, a, cult, of, personality, devoted, to, gaddafi, existed, in, libya, through, most, of, his, rule, his, biographer, alison, pargeter, noted, that, he, filled, every, space, moulding, the, entire, country, around, himself, depictions, of, his, face, could, be, found, throughout, the, country, including, on, postage, stamps, watches, and, school,

private, gaddafi, often, complained, that, he, disliked, this, personality, cult, surrounding, him, but, that, he, tolerated, it, because, the, people, of, libya, adored, him, the, cult, served, a, political, purpose, with, gaddafi, helping, to, provide, a, central, identity, for, the, libyan, state, several, biographers, and, observers, characterized, gaddafi, as, a, populist, he, enjoyed, attending, lengthy, public, sessions, where, people, were, invited, to, question, him, these, were, often, televised, throughout, libya, crowds, of, supporters, would, arrive, at, public, events, where, he, appeared, described, as, spontaneous, demonstrations, by, the, government, there, are, recorded, instances, of, groups, being, coerced, or, paid, to, attend, he, was, typically, late, to, public, events, and, would, sometimes, fail, to, arrive, although, bianco, thought, he, had, a, gift, for, oratory, he, was, considered, a, poor, orator, by, blundy, and, lycett, the, biographer, daniel, kawczynski, noted, that, gaddafi, was, famed, for, his, lengthy, wandering, speeches, which, typically, involved, criticizing, israel, and, the, us, the, journalist, ruth, first, described, his, speeches, as, being, an, inexhaustible, flow, didactic, at, times, incoherent, peppered, with, snatches, of, half, formed, opinions, admonitions, confidences, some, sound, common, sense, and, as, much, prejudice, supporters, praised, gaddafi, s, administration, for, the, creation, of, a, more, equal, society, through, domestic, reform, they, stressed, the, regime, s, achievements, in, combating, homelessness, ensuring, access, to, food, and, safe, drinking, water, and, to, dramatic, improvements, in, education, supporters, have, also, applauded, achievements, in, medical, care, praising, the, universal, free, healthcare, provided, under, the, gaddafist, administration, with, diseases, like, cholera, and, typhoid, being, contained, and, life, expectancy, raised, gaddafi, s, government, s, treatment, of, non, arab, libyans, came, in, for, criticism, from, human, rights, activists, with, native, berbers, italian, colonists, jews, refugees, and, foreign, workers, all, facing, persecution, in, gaddafist, libya, human, rights, groups, also, criticized, the, treatment, of, migrants, including, asylum, seekers, who, passed, through, gaddafi, s, libya, on, their, way, to, europe, during, the, civil, war, various, leftist, groups, endorsed, the, anti, gaddafist, rebels, but, not, the, western, military, intervention, by, arguing, that, gaddafi, had, become, an, ally, of, western, imperialism, by, cooperating, with, the, war, on, terror, and, efforts, to, block, african, migration, to, europe, gaddafi, was, widely, perceived, as, a, terrorist, especially, in, the, us, and, uk, international, reactions, to, gaddafi, s, death, were, divided, gaddafi, was, mourned, as, a, hero, by, many, across, sub, saharan, africa, but, was, widely, condemned, elsewhere, following, his, defeat, in, the, civil, war, gaddafi, s, system, of, governance, was, dismantled, and, replaced, by, the, interim, government, of, the, ntc, which, legalized, trade, unions, and, freedom, of, the, press, in, january, 2013, the, gnc, officially, renamed, the, jamahiriyah, as, the, state, of, libya, gaddafi, loyalists, then, founded, a, new, political, party, the, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, libya, led, by, saif, al, islam, gaddafi, the, popular, front, was, allowed, to, participate, in, the, future, general, election, due, to, the, lack, of, standardization, of, transcribing, written, and, regionally, pronounced, arabic, gaddafi, s, name, has, been, romanized, in, various, ways, a, 1986, column, by, the, straight, dope, lists, 32,
