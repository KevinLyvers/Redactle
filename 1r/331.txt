of, the, instituto, cervantes, in, every, book, i, try, to, make, a, different, path, one, doesn, t, choose, the, style, you, can, investigate, and, try, to, discover, what, the, best, style, would, be, for, a, theme, but, the, style, is, determined, by, the, subject, by, the, mood, of, the, times, if, you, try, to, use, something, that, is, not, suitable, it, just, won, t, work, then, the, critics, build, theories, around, that, and, they, see, things, i, hadn, t, seen, i, only, respond, to, our, way, of, life, the, life, of, the, caribbean, garc, a, m, rquez, was, noted, for, leaving, out, seemingly, important, details, and, events, so, the, reader, is, forced, into, a, more, participatory, role, in, the, story, development, for, example, in, no, one, writes, to, the, colonel, the, main, characters, are, not, given, names, this, practice, is, influenced, by, greek, tragedies, such, as, antigone, and, oedipus, rex, in, which, important, events, occur, off, stage, and, are, left, to, the, audience, s, imagination, reality, is, an, important, theme, in, all, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, works, he, said, of, his, early, works, with, the, exception, of, leaf, storm, nobody, writes, to, the, colonel, in, evil, hour, and, big, mama, s, funeral, all, reflect, the, reality, of, life, in, colombia, and, this, theme, determines, the, rational, structure, of, the, books, i, don, t, regret, having, written, them, but, they, belong, to, a, kind, of, premeditated, literature, that, offers, too, static, and, exclusive, a, vision, of, reality, in, his, other, works, he, experimented, more, with, less, traditional, approaches, to, reality, so, that, the, most, frightful, the, most, unusual, things, are, told, with, the, deadpan, expression, a, commonly, cited, example, is, the, physical, and, spiritual, ascending, into, heaven, of, a, character, while, she, is, hanging, the, laundry, out, to, dry, in, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, the, style, of, these, works, fits, in, the, marvellous, realm, described, by, the, cuban, writer, alejo, carpentier, and, was, labeled, as, magical, realism, literary, critic, michael, bell, proposes, an, alternative, understanding, for, garc, a, m, rquez, s, style, as, the, category, magic, realism, is, criticized, for, being, dichotomizing, and, exoticizing, what, is, really, at, stake, is, a, psychological, suppleness, which, is, able, to, inhabit, unsentimentally, the, daytime, world, while, remaining, open, to, the, promptings, of, those, domains, which, modern, culture, has, by, its, own, inner, logic, necessarily, marginalised, or, repressed, garc, a, m, rquez, and, his, friend, plinio, apuleyo, mendoza, discuss, his, work, in, a, similar, way, the, way, you, treat, reality, in, your, books, has, been, called, magical, realism, i, have, the, feeling, your, european, readers, are, usually, aware, of, the, magic, of, your, stories, but, fail, to, see, the, reality, behind, it, this, is, surely, because, their, rationalism, prevents, them, seeing, that, reality, isn, t, limited, to, the, price, of, tomatoes, and, eggs, the, theme, of, solitude, runs, through, much, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, works, as, pelayo, notes, love, in, the, time, of, cholera, like, all, of, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, s, work, explores, the, solitude, of, the, individual, and, of, humankind, portrayed, through, the, solitude, of, love, and, of, being, in, love, in, response, to, plinio, apuleyo, mendoza, s, question, if, solitude, is, the, theme, of, all, your, books, where, should, we, look, for, the, roots, of, this, over, riding, emotion, in, your, childhood, perhaps, garc, a, m, rquez, replied, i, think, it, s, a, problem, everybody, has, everyone, has, his, own, way, and, means, of, expressing, it, the, feeling, pervades, the, work, of, so, many, writers, although, some, of, them, may, express, it, unconsciously, in, his, nobel, prize, acceptance, speech, solitude, of, latin, america, he, relates, this, theme, of, solitude, to, the, latin, american, experience, the, interpretation, of, our, reality, through, patterns, not, our, own, serves, only, to, make, us, ever, more, unknown, ever, less, free, ever, more, solitary, another, important, theme, in, many, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, work, is, the, setting, of, the, village, he, calls, macondo, he, uses, his, home, town, of, aracataca, colombia, as, a, cultural, historical, and, geographical, reference, to, create, this, imaginary, town, but, the, representation, of, the, village, is, not, limited, to, this, specific, area, garc, a, m, rquez, shares, macondo, is, not, so, much, a, place, as, a, state, of, mind, which, allows, you, to, see, what, you, want, and, how, you, want, to, see, it, even, when, his, stories, do, not, take, place, in, macondo, there, is, often, still, a, consistent, lack, of, specificity, to, the, location, so, while, they, are, often, set, with, a, caribbean, coastline, and, an, andean, hinterland, otherwise, unspecified, in, accordance, with, garc, a, m, rquez, s, evident, attempt, to, capture, a, more, general, regional, myth, rather, than, give, a, specific, political, analysis, this, fictional, town, has, become, well, known, in, the, literary, world, as, stavans, notes, of, macondo, its, geography, and, inhabitants, constantly, invoked, by, teachers, politicians, and, tourist, agents, makes, it, hard, to, believe, it, is, a, sheer, fabrication, in, leaf, storm, garc, a, m, rquez, depicts, the, realities, of, the, banana, boom, in, macondo, which, include, a, period, of, great, wealth, during, the, presence, of, the, us, companies, and, a, period, of, depression, upon, the, departure, of, the, american, banana, companies, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, takes, place, in, macondo, and, tells, the, complete, history, of, the, fictional, town, from, its, founding, to, its, doom, the, account, of, macondo, in, constance, pedoto, in, the, handsomest, drowned, man, in, the, world, has, been, compared, to, tales, from, alaska, which, combine, the, real, and, the, surreal, deriving, from, an, upbringing, which, combined, superstitious, beliefs, and, a, harsh, environment, in, his, autobiography, garc, a, m, rquez, explains, his, fascination, with, the, word, and, concept, macondo, he, describes, a, trip, he, made, with, his, mother, back, to, aracataca, as, a, young, man, the, train, stopped, at, a, station, that, had, no, town, and, a, short, while, later, it, passed, the, only, banana, plantation, along, the, route, that, had, its, name, written, over, the, gate, macondo, this, word, had, attracted, my, attention, ever, since, the, first, trips, i, had, made, with, my, grandfather, but, i, discovered, only, as, an, adult, that, i, liked, its, poetic, resonance, i, never, heard, anyone, say, it, and, did, not, even, ask, myself, what, it, meant, i, happened, to, read, in, an, encyclopedia, that, it, is, a, tropical, tree, resembling, the, ceiba, in, several, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, works, including, no, one, writes, to, the, colonel, in, evil, hour, and, leaf, storm, he, referenced, la, violencia, the, violence, a, brutal, civil, war, between, conservatives, and, liberals, that, lasted, into, the, 1960s, causing, the, deaths, of, several, hundred, thousand, colombians, throughout, all, of, his, novels, there, are, subtle, references, to, la, violencia, for, example, characters, live, under, various, unjust, situations, like, curfew, press, censorship, and, underground, newspapers, in, evil, hour, while, not, one, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, most, famous, novels, is, notable, for, its, portrayal, of, la, violencia, with, its, fragmented, portrayal, of, social, disintegration, provoked, by, la, violencia, although, garc, a, m, rquez, did, portray, the, corrupt, nature, and, the, injustices, of, times, like, la, violencia, he, refused, to, use, his, work, as, a, platform, for, political, propaganda, for, him, the, duty, of, the, revolutionary, writer, is, to, write, well, and, the, ideal, novel, is, one, that, moves, its, reader, by, its, political, and, social, content, and, at, the, same, time, by, its, power, to, penetrate, reality, and, expose, its, other, side, whether, in, fiction, or, nonfiction, in, the, epic, novel, or, the, concentrated, story, m, rquez, is, now, recognized, in, the, words, of, carlos, fuentes, as, the, most, popular, and, perhaps, the, best, writer, in, spanish, since, cervantes, he, is, one, of, those, very, rare, artists, who, succeed, in, chronicling, not, only, a, nation, s, life, culture, and, history, but, also, those, of, an, entire, continent, and, a, master, storyteller, who, as, the, new, york, review, of, books, once, said, forces, upon, us, at, every, page, the, wonder, and, extravagance, of, life, garc, a, m, rquez, s, work, is, an, important, part, of, the, latin, american, boom, of, literature, often, defined, around, his, works, and, those, of, julio, cort, zar, carlos, fuentes, and, mario, vargas, llosa, his, work, has, challenged, critics, of, colombian, literature, to, step, out, of, the, conservative, criticism, that, had, been, dominant, before, the, success, of, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, in, a, review, of, literary, criticism, robert, sims, notes, garc, a, m, rquez, continues, to, cast, a, lengthy, shadow, in, colombia, latin, america, and, the, united, states, critical, works, on, the, 1982, nobel, laureate, have, reached, industrial, proportion, and, show, no, signs, of, abating, moreover, garc, a, m, rquez, has, galvanized, colombian, literature, in, an, unprecedented, way, by, giving, a, tremendous, impetus, to, colombian, literature, indeed, he, has, become, a, touchstone, for, literature, and, criticism, throughout, the, americas, as, his, work, has, created, a, certain, attraction, repulsion, among, critics, and, writers, while, readers, continue, to, devour, new, publications, no, one, can, deny, that, garc, a, m, rquez, has, helped, rejuvenate, reformulate, and, recontextualize, literature, and, criticism, in, colombia, and, the, rest, of, latin, america, following, his, death, garc, a, m, rquez, s, family, made, the, decision, to, deposit, his, papers, and, some, of, his, personal, effects, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, s, harry, ransom, center, a, humanities, research, library, and, museum, in, 2023, garc, a, m, rquez, surpassed, miguel, de, cervantes, as, the, most, translated, spanish, language, writer, according, to, the, world, translation, map, the,
