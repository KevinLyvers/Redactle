or, sixth, ancestor, of, chan, traditional, chinese, is, a, semi, legendary, but, central, figure, in, the, early, history, of, chinese, chan, buddhism, according, to, tradition, he, was, an, uneducated, layman, who, suddenly, attained, awakening, chinese, jianxing, upon, hearing, the, diamond, sutra, despite, his, lack, of, formal, training, he, demonstrated, his, understanding, to, the, fifth, patriarch, daman, hongren, who, then, supposedly, chose, huineng, as, his, true, successor, instead, of, his, publicly, known, selection, of, yuquan, shenxiu, twentieth, century, scholarship, revealed, that, the, story, of, huineng, s, buddhist, career, was, likely, invented, by, the, monk, heze, shenhui, who, claimed, to, be, one, of, huineng, s, disciples, and, was, highly, critical, of, shenxiu, s, teaching, huineng, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, sudden, enlightenment, southern, chan, school, of, buddhism, which, focuses, on, an, immediate, and, direct, attainment, of, buddhist, enlightenment, the, platform, sutra, of, the, sixth, patriarch, which, is, said, to, be, a, record, of, his, teachings, is, a, highly, influential, text, in, the, east, asian, buddhist, tradition, the, two, primary, sources, for, huineng, s, life, are, the, preface, to, the, platform, sutra, and, the, transmission, of, the, lamp, most, modern, scholars, doubt, the, historicity, of, traditional, biographies, and, works, written, about, huineng, considering, his, extended, biography, to, be, a, legendary, narrative, based, on, a, historical, person, of, merely, regional, significance, of, whom, very, little, is, known, this, legendary, narrative, reflects, historical, and, religious, developments, which, took, place, in, the, century, after, his, life, and, death, the, platform, s, tra, of, the, sixth, patriarch, is, attributed, to, a, disciple, of, huineng, named, fahai, and, purports, to, be, a, record, of, huineng, s, life, lectures, and, interactions, with, disciples, however, the, text, shows, signs, of, having, been, constructed, over, a, longer, period, of, time, and, contains, different, layers, of, writing, according, to, john, mcrae, it, is, a, wonderful, melange, of, early, chan, teachings, a, virtual, repository, of, the, entire, tradition, up, to, the, second, half, of, the, eighth, century, at, the, heart, of, the, sermon, is, the, same, understanding, of, the, buddha, nature, that, we, have, seen, in, texts, attributed, to, bodhidharma, and, hongren, including, the, idea, that, the, fundamental, buddha, nature, is, only, made, invisible, to, ordinary, humans, by, their, illusions, according, to, wong, the, platform, s, tra, cites, and, explains, a, wide, range, of, buddhist, scriptures, listed, here, in, the, order, of, appearance, according, to, huineng, s, autobiography, in, the, platform, sutra, huineng, s, father, was, from, fanyang, but, he, was, banished, from, his, government, position, and, died, at, a, young, age, huineng, and, his, mother, were, left, in, poverty, and, moved, to, nanhai, where, huineng, sold, firewood, to, support, his, family, one, day, huineng, delivered, firewood, to, a, customer, s, shop, where, he, saw, a, man, reciting, the, diamond, sutra, on, my, way, out, of, the, gate, i, saw, someone, reciting, a, sutra, and, as, soon, as, i, heard, the, words, of, the, sutra, my, mind, opened, forth, in, enlightenment, he, inquired, about, the, reason, that, the, diamond, sutra, was, chanted, and, the, person, stated, that, he, came, from, the, eastern, meditation, monastery, in, huangmei, district, of, the, province, of, qi, where, the, fifth, patriarch, of, chan, lived, and, delivered, his, teachings, huineng, s, customer, paid, his, ten, silver, taels, and, suggested, that, he, meet, the, fifth, patriarch, of, chan, huineng, reached, huangmei, thirty, days, later, and, expressed, to, the, fifth, patriarch, his, specific, request, of, attaining, buddhahood, since, huineng, came, from, guangdong, and, was, physically, distinctive, from, the, local, northern, chinese, the, fifth, patriarch, hongren, questioned, his, origin, as, a, barbarian, from, the, south, and, doubted, his, ability, to, attain, enlightenment, huineng, impressed, hongren, with, a, clear, understanding, of, the, ubiquitous, buddha, nature, in, everyone, and, convinced, hongren, to, let, him, stay, the, first, chapter, of, the, ming, canon, version, of, the, platform, sutra, describes, the, introduction, of, huineng, to, hongren, as, follows, the, patriarch, asked, me, who, are, you, and, what, do, you, seek, i, replied, your, disciple, is, a, commoner, from, xinzhou, of, lingnan, i, have, travelled, far, to, pay, homage, to, you, and, seek, nothing, other, than, buddhahood, so, you, re, from, ling, nan, and, a, barbarian, how, can, you, expect, to, become, a, buddha, asked, the, patriarch, i, replied, although, people, exist, as, northerners, and, southerners, in, the, buddha, nature, there, is, neither, north, nor, south, a, barbarian, differs, from, your, holiness, physically, but, what, difference, is, there, in, our, buddha, nature, huineng, was, told, to, split, firewood, and, pound, rice, in, the, backyard, of, the, monastery, and, avoid, going, to, the, main, hall, eight, months, later, the, fifth, patriarch, summoned, all, his, followers, and, proposed, a, poem, contest, for, his, followers, to, demonstrate, the, stage, of, their, understanding, of, the, essence, of, mind, he, decided, to, pass, down, his, robe, and, teachings, to, the, winner, of, the, contest, who, would, become, the, sixth, patriarch, shenxiu, the, leading, disciple, of, the, fifth, patriarch, composed, a, stanza, but, did, not, have, the, courage, to, present, it, to, the, master, instead, he, wrote, his, stanza, on, the, south, corridor, wall, one, day, at, midnight, to, remain, anonymous, the, other, monks, saw, the, stanza, and, commended, it, shenxiu, s, stanza, is, as, follows, the, body, is, the, bodhi, tree, the, mind, is, like, a, bright, mirror, s, stand, at, all, times, we, must, strive, to, polish, it, and, must, not, let, dust, collect, the, patriarch, was, not, satisfied, with, shenxiu, s, stanza, and, pointed, out, that, the, poem, did, not, show, understanding, of, own, fundamental, nature, and, essence, of, mind, he, gave, shenxiu, a, chance, to, submit, another, poem, to, demonstrate, that, he, had, entered, the, gate, of, enlightenment, so, that, he, could, transmit, his, robe, and, the, dharma, to, shenxiu, but, the, student, s, mind, was, agitated, and, could, not, write, one, more, stanza, two, days, later, the, illiterate, huineng, heard, shenxiu, s, stanza, being, chanted, by, a, young, attendant, at, the, monastery, and, inquired, about, the, context, of, the, poem, the, attendant, explained, to, him, the, poem, contest, and, the, transmission, of, the, robe, and, dharma, huineng, asked, to, be, led, to, the, corridor, where, he, could, also, pay, homage, to, the, stanza, he, asked, a, low, ranking, official, named, zhang, riyong, from, jiangzhou, to, read, the, verse, to, him, and, then, immediately, asked, him, to, write, down, a, stanza, that, he, composed, according, to, mcrae, the, earliest, version, of, the, platform, sutra, contains, two, versions, of, huineng, s, verse, left, and, middle, later, versions, such, as, the, zongbao, edition, c, 1291, from, the, yuan, era, contain, one, version, of, huineng, s, stanza, somewhat, different, from, the, two, verses, found, in, the, c, 8th, century, dunhuang, edition, right, yuan, dynasty, text, bodhi, originally, has, no, tree, the, mirror, has, no, stand, the, buddha, nature, is, always, clear, and, pure, where, is, there, room, for, dust, dunhuang, text, the, mind, is, the, bodhi, tree, the, body, is, the, bright, mirror, s, stand, the, bright, mirror, is, originally, clear, and, pure, where, could, there, be, any, dust, dunhuang, text, bodhi, originally, has, no, tree, the, bright, mirror, also, has, no, stand, fundamentally, there, is, not, a, single, thing, where, could, dust, arise, the, followers, who, were, present, were, astonished, by, the, work, of, a, southern, barbarian, being, cautious, of, huineng, s, status, the, patriarch, wiped, away, the, stanza, and, claimed, that, the, author, of, the, stanza, had, not, reached, enlightenment, according, to, the, traditional, interpretation, which, is, based, on, guifeng, zongmi, the, fifth, generation, successor, of, shenhui, the, two, verses, represent, respectively, the, gradual, and, the, sudden, approach, according, to, mcrae, this, is, an, incorrect, understanding, he, verse, attributed, to, shenxiu, does, not, in, fact, refer, to, gradual, or, progressive, endeavor, but, to, a, constant, practice, of, cleaning, the, mirror, is, basic, message, was, that, of, the, constant, and, perfect, teaching, the, endless, personal, manifestation, of, the, bodhisattva, ideal, huineng, s, verse, does, not, stand, alone, but, forms, a, pair, with, shenxiu, s, verse, huineng, s, verse, s, apply, the, rhetoric, of, emptiness, to, undercut, the, substantiality, of, the, terms, of, that, formulation, however, the, basic, meaning, of, the, first, proposition, still, remains, mcrae, notes, a, similarity, in, reasoning, with, the, oxhead, school, which, used, a, threefold, structure, of, absolute, relative, and, middle, or, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, according, to, mcrae, the, platform, sutra, itself, is, the, synthesis, in, this, threefold, structure, giving, a, balance, between, the, need, of, constant, practice, and, the, insight, into, the, absolute, however, on, the, next, day, the, patriarch, secretly, went, to, huineng, s, room, and, asked, should, not, a, seeker, after, the, dharma, risk, his, life, this, way, then, he, asked, is, the, rice, ready, huineng, responded, that, the, rice, was, ready, and, only, waiting, to, be, sieved, the, patriarch, secretly, explained, the, diamond, sutra, to, huineng, and, when, huineng, heard, the, phrase, one, should, activate, one, s, mind, so, it, has, no, attachment, he, was, suddenly, and, completely, enlightened, and, understood, that, all, things, exist, in, self, nature, the, dharma, was, passed, to, huineng, at, night, when, the, patriarch, transmitted, the, doctrine, of, sudden, enlightenment, as, well, as, his, robe, and, bowl, to, huineng, he, told, huineng, you, are, now, the, sixth, patriarch, take, care, of, yourself, save, as, many, sentient, beings, as, you, can, and, spread, the, teachings, so, they, will, not, be, lost, in, the, future, he, also, explained, to, huineng, that, the, dharma, was, transmitted, from, mind, to, mind, whereas, the, robe, was, passed, down, physically, from, one, patriarch, to, the, next, hongren, instructed, the, sixth, patriarch, to, leave, the, monastery, before, he, could, be, harmed, you, can, stop, at, huai, and, then, hide, yourself, at, hui, hongren, showed, huineng, the, route, to, leave, the, monastery, and, rowed, huineng, across, the, river, to, assist, his, escape, huineng, immediately, responded, with, a, clear, understanding, of, hongren, s, purpose, in, doing, so, and, demonstrated, that, he, could, ferry, to, the, other, shore, with, the, dharma, that, had, been, transmitted, to, him, the, sixth, patriarch, reached, the, tayu, mountains, within, two, months, and, realized, that, hundreds, of, men, were, following, him, attempting, to, rob, him, of, the, robe, and, bowl, however, the, robe, and, bowl, could, not, be, moved, by, huiming, who, then, asked, for, the, transmission, of, dharma, from, huineng, huineng, helped, him, reach, enlightenment, and, continued, on, his, journey, the, earliest, and, most, important, source, for, the, teachings, of, huineng, is, the, platform, sutra, of, the, sixth, patriarch, chinese, pinyin, li, z, t, nj, ng, there, are, various, editions, of, this, text, the, earliest, of, which, are, copies, from, dunhuang, which, date, to, the, 9th, century, the, original, may, have, been, composed, in, around, 780, ce, according, to, modern, scholars, like, yanagida, seizan, and, john, mcrae, the, early, platform, sutra, was, composed, within, the, oxhead, school, not, within, the, so, called, southern, school, as, was, previously, believed, the, text, continued, to, be, edited, and, expanded, until, the, yuan, dynasty, 1271, 1368, when, zongbao, produced, an, edition, that, eventually, became, part, of, the, standard, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, chinese, buddhist, canon, according, to, peter, gregory, the, most, important, ideas, in, the, platform, sutra, for, which, it, is, best, known, form, a, set, of, three, key, interrelated, doctrines, no, thought, wunian, nonform, also, translated, as, nonattribute, wuxiang, and, nonabiding, wuzhu, in, the, platform, sutra, huineng, taught, no, thought, the, pure, and, unattached, mind, which, comes, and, goes, freely, and, functions, fluently, without, any, hindrance, it, does, not, mean, that, one, does, not, think, at, all, but, is, a, highly, attentive, yet, unentangled, way, of, being, an, open, non, conceptual, state, of, mind, that, allows, one, to, experience, reality, directly, as, it, truly, is, regarding, non, thought, huineng, says, thoughtlessness, is, to, see, and, to, know, all, dharmas, with, a, mind, free, from, attachment, when, in, use, it, pervades, everywhere, and, yet, it, sticks, nowhere, what, we, have, to, do, is, to, purify, our, mind, so, that, the, six, vij, nas, in, passing, through, the, six, gates, will, neither, be, defiled, by, nor, attached, to, the, six, sense, objects, when, our, mind, works, freely, without, any, hindrance, and, is, at, liberty, to, come, or, to, go, we, attain, sam, dhi, of, praj, or, liberation, such, a, state, is, called, the, function, of, thoughtlessness, but, to, refrain, from, thinking, of, anything, so, that, all, thoughts, are, suppressed, is, to, be, dharma, ridden, and, this, is, an, erroneous, view, as, gregory, points, out, for, huineng, no, thought, does, not, refer, to, a, blanking, out, of, the, mind, rather, huineng, says, freedom, from, thought, means, having, no, thought, in, the, midst, of, thoughts, he, says, that, such, things, as, sitting, without, moving, getting, rid, of, falsehood, and, not, giving, rise, to, thoughts, just, lead, to, insentiency, this, is, to, obstruct, the, way, which, should, on, the, contrary, be, allowed, to, flow, freely, without, any, obstruction, for, huineng, suchness, and, thought, exist, together, in, an, essence, function, relationship, he, says, suchness, is, the, essence, of, thought, thought, is, the, function, of, suchness, related, to, the, teaching, of, non, thought, huineng, also, taught, non, attribute, just, as, non, thought, does, not, eradicate, thoughts, non, attribute, for, huineng, likewise, is, not, a, world, denying, negation, of, the, attributes, of, sensory, experience, the, vast, array, of, things, and, characteristics, which, make, up, the, basic, features, of, life, in, the, world, rather, for, huineng, non, attribute, has, a, this, worldly, orientation, which, affirms, human, experience, and, the, world, of, characteristics, it, does, not, mean, literally, to, be, without, any, attributes, at, all, but, rather, to, be, free, of, attributes, while, right, in, the, midst, of, attributes, to, differentiate, and, distinguish, the, various, phenomena, of, the, world, and, yet, to, regard, them, all, as, the, same, is, to, have, equanimity, sh, as, brook, ziporyn, observes, for, huineng, our, self, nature, is, free, of, attributes, not, in, the, sense, of, excluding, them, but, in, the, sense, of, embracing, them, all, without, attaching, to, them, in, this, way, our, self, nature, can, be, compared, to, space, while, particular, attributes, are, like, the, things, appearing, in, that, space, huineng, says, learned, audience, the, illimitable, void, of, the, universe, is, capable, of, holding, myriads, of, things, of, various, shape, and, form, such, as, the, sun, the, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, men, dharmas, pertaining, to, goodness, or, badness, deva, planes, hells, great, oceans, and, all, the, mountains, of, the, mah, meru, space, takes, in, all, of, these, and, so, does, the, voidness, of, our, nature, we, say, that, the, essence, of, mind, is, great, because, it, embraces, all, things, since, all, things, are, within, our, nature, in, addition, to, non, thought, and, non, attribute, huineng, also, taught, non, abiding, he, says, rather, than, attach, to, characteristics, and, obstruct, the, way, one, should, not, abide, in, things, again, like, non, thought, and, non, attribute, non, abiding, for, huineng, means, all, things, and, thoughts, are, allowed, but, not, attached, to, similar, to, space, however, as, ziporyn, points, out, huineng, s, teaching, of, non, abiding, puts, a, spin, on, the, motionlessness, of, the, spacelike, self, nature, that, is, unlike, the, traditional, buddhist, emphasis, on, stillness, and, quiescence, which, register, no, attributes, and, give, rise, to, no, activity, for, huineng, non, abiding, means, that, true, motionlessness, is, a, kind, of, hyperintense, motion, that, never, dwells, or, stays, in, the, same, place, in, this, way, as, ziporyn, observes, huineng, s, teaching, resonates, with, indigenous, chinese, notions, which, give, a, positive, value, to, change, and, transformation, for, huineng, enlightenment, is, associated, with, flow, constant, change, and, transformation, he, says, good, friends, one, s, enlightenment, one, s, way, dao, must, flow, freely, how, could, it, be, stagnated, when, the, mind, does, not, reside, in, the, dharmas, one, s, enlightenment, flows, freely, for, the, mind, to, reside, in, the, dharmas, is, called, fettering, oneself, if, you, say, that, always, sitting, without, moving, is, it, then, you, re, just, like, riputra, meditating, in, the, forest, for, which, he, was, scolded, by, vimalak, rti, similarly, the, alleged, northern, school, s, emphasis, on, quiet, contemplation, was, criticized, by, huineng, thus, when, alive, one, keeps, sitting, without, lying, down, when, dead, one, lies, down, without, sitting, up, in, both, cases, a, set, of, stinking, bones, what, has, it, to, do, with, the, great, lesson, of, life, huineng, taught, that, meditation, and, wisdom, were, not, sequential, with, one, being, prior, to, and, giving, rise, to, the, other, since, in, that, case, the, dharma, would, have, two, characteristics, instead, huineng, says, they, are, not, different, and, form, an, essence, function, relationship, for, huineng, wisdom, is, the, function, of, meditation, while, meditation, is, the, essence, of, wisdom, in, this, way, when, wisdom, is, present, so, too, is, meditation, and, when, meditation, is, present, so, too, is, wisdom, huineng, uses, an, analogy, of, a, lamp, and, its, light, to, illustrate, this, point, where, light, is, the, function, of, a, lamp, the, lamp, is, the, essence, of, the, light, as, gregory, points, out, huineng, s, oneness, of, meditation, and, wisdom, is, a, sudden, practice, as, it, does, not, treat, meditation, or, concentration, as, a, means, of, achieving, wisdom, for, that, would, be, to, understand, meditation, and, wisdom, dualistically, moreover, using, meditation, as, a, means, takes, enlightenment, as, something, to, be, realized, in, the, future, such, an, understanding, is, gradualistic, and, fails, to, recognize, the, enlightenment, that, is, already, present, huineng, defines, zuochan, seated, meditation, in, a, non, literal, way, as, follows, he, says, sitting, zuo, means, for, the, mind, not, to, be, activated, in, regards, to, various, good, and, bad, realms, externally, while, meditation, chan, means, to, see, the, motionlessness, of, the, self, nature, internally, he, criticizes, motionlessness, of, the, body, as, well, as, the, practices, of, concentrating, on, mind, and, on, purity, he, says, if, one, is, to, concentrate, on, the, mind, then, the, mind, is, fundamentally, false, you, should, understand, that, the, mind, is, like, a, phantasm, so, nothing, can, concentrate, on, it, if, one, is, to, concentrate, on, purity, then, our, natures, are, fundamentally, pure, it, is, through, false, thoughts, that, suchness, is, covered, up, just, be, without, false, thoughts, and, the, nature, is, pure, of, itself, if, you, activate, your, mind, to, become, attached, to, purity, you, will, only, generate, the, falseness, of, purity, the, false, is, without, location, it, is, the, concentration, that, is, false, purity, is, without, shape, and, characteristics, you, only, create, the, characteristics, of, purity, and, say, this, is, effort, to, have, such, a, view, is, to, obscure, one, s, own, fundamental, nature, and, only, to, be, fettered, by, purity, as, gregory, observes, concentrating, on, or, viewing, the, mind, and, purity, are, both, dualistic, as, this, is, to, make, mind, and, purity, into, objects, such, objectification, is, false, moreover, our, nature, is, intrinsically, pure, but, activating, the, mind, to, view, purity, only, externalizes, that, nature, this, is, to, be, deluded, and, to, cover, our, fundamental, purity, so, that, it, will, not, be, seen, doctrinally, the, southern, school, is, associated, with, the, teaching, that, enlightenment, is, sudden, while, the, northern, school, is, associated, with, the, teaching, that, enlightenment, is, gradual, this, is, a, polemical, exaggeration, since, both, schools, were, derived, from, the, same, tradition, and, the, so, called, southern, school, incorporated, many, teachings, of, the, more, influential, northern, school, eventually, both, schools, died, out, but, the, influence, of, shenhui, was, so, immense, that, all, later, chan, schools, traced, their, origin, to, huineng, and, sudden, enlightenment, became, a, standard, doctrine, of, chan, according, to, modern, historiography, huineng, was, a, marginal, and, obscure, historical, figure, modern, scholarship, has, questioned, his, hagiography, with, some, researchers, speculating, that, this, story, was, created, around, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, beginning, in, 731, by, shenhui, who, supposedly, was, a, successor, to, huineng, to, win, influence, at, the, imperial, court, he, claimed, huineng, to, be, the, successor, to, hongren, instead, of, the, then, publicly, recognized, successor, shenxiu, it, was, through, the, propaganda, of, shenhui, 684, 758, that, huineng, d, 710, became, the, also, today, still, towering, figure, of, sixth, patriarch, of, chan, zen, buddhism, and, accepted, as, the, ancestor, or, founder, of, all, subsequent, chan, lineages, using, the, life, of, confucius, as, a, template, for, its, structure, shenhui, invented, a, hagiography, for, the, then, highly, obscure, huineng, at, the, same, time, shenhui, forged, a, lineage, of, patriarchs, of, chan, back, to, the, buddha, using, ideas, from, indian, buddhism, and, chinese, ancestor, worship, in, 745, shenhui, was, invited, to, take, up, residence, in, the, heze, temple, in, luoyang, in, 753, he, fell, out, of, grace, and, had, to, leave, the, capital, to, go, into, exile, the, most, prominent, of, the, successors, of, his, lineage, was, guifeng, zongmi, according, to, zongmi, shenhui, s, approach, was, officially, sanctioned, in, 796, when, an, imperial, commission, determined, that, the, southern, line, of, ch, an, represented, the, orthodox, transmission, and, established, shen, hui, as, the, seventh, patriarch, placing, an, inscription, to, that, effect, in, the, shen, lung, temple, according, to, schl, tter, and, teiser, the, biography, of, huineng, explained, in, the, platform, sutra, is, a, compelling, legend, of, an, illiterate, barbarian, layman, who, became, a, patriarch, of, chan, buddhism, most, of, what, we, know, about, huineng, comes, from, the, platform, sutra, which, consists, of, the, record, of, a, public, talk, that, includes, an, autobiography, of, huineng, which, was, a, hagiography, i, e, a, biography, of, a, saint, portraying, him, as, a, hero, this, pseudoautobiography, was, written, to, give, authority, to, the, teachings, of, huineng, the, sutra, became, a, very, popular, text, and, was, circulated, widely, in, an, attempt, to, increase, the, importance, of, the, huineng, lineage, as, a, result, the, account, might, have, been, altered, over, the, centuries, shenhui, 685, 758, was, the, first, person, to, claim, that, huineng, was, both, a, saint, and, a, hero, as, a, result, of, this, contested, claim, modifications, were, made, to, the, platform, sutra, a, manuscript, copy, of, which, was, later, found, at, dunhuang, it, turns, out, that, little, was, known, about, huineng, before, shenhui, s, account, of, him, it, took, all, the, rhetorical, skills, of, shen, hui, and, his, sympathizers, to, give, a, form, to, the, name, huineng, thus, the, character, huineng, described, by, shenhui, was, not, completely, factual, in, the, platform, sutra, following, huineng, s, sermon, was, a, narrative, by, fahai, who, addressed, a, few, interviews, between, huineng, and, his, disciples, including, shenhui, it, is, likely, that, much, of, the, platform, sutra, was, built, on, the, inventions, of, shenhui, and, the, textual, evidence, suggests, that, the, work, was, written, soon, after, his, death, after, huineng, s, death, shenhui, wanted, to, claim, his, authority, over, chan, buddhism, but, his, position, was, challenged, by, shenxiu, and, puji, who, supported, the, northern, lineage, that, taught, gradual, enlightenment, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, this, autobiography, was, likely, an, attempt, by, shenhui, to, relate, himself, to, the, most, renowned, figures, in, zen, buddhism, which, essentially, enabled, him, to, connect, to, the, buddha, through, this, lineage, an, epitaph, of, huineng, inscribed, by, the, established, poet, wang, wei, also, reveals, inconsistencies, with, shenhui, s, account, of, huineng, the, epitaph, does, not, attack, northern, chan, and, adds, new, information, on, a, monk, yinzong, 627, 713, who, is, said, to, have, tonsured, huineng, wang, wei, was, a, poet, and, a, government, official, whereas, shenhui, was, a, propagandist, who, preached, to, the, crowd, which, again, leads, to, questions, about, his, credibility, as, far, as, can, be, determined, from, surviving, evidence, shenhui, possessed, little, or, no, reliable, information, on, huineng, except, that, he, was, a, disciple, of, hongren, lived, in, shaozhou, and, was, regarded, by, some, chan, followers, as, a, teacher, of, only, regional, importance, it, seems, that, shenhui, invented, the, figure, of, huineng, for, himself, to, become, the, true, heir, of, the, single, line, of, transmission, from, the, buddha, in, the, southern, lineage, and, this, appears, to, be, the, only, way, he, could, have, done, so, on, a, related, note, the, chan, buddhist, practices, including, the, wordless, transmission, and, sudden, enlightenment, were, much, different, from, the, traditional, training, of, a, monk, according, to, kieschnick, the, chan, accounts, ridicule, every, element, of, the, scholar, monk, ideal, that, had, taken, shape, over, the, centuries, in, traditional, hagiography, with, examples, found, in, the, immense, literature, of, the, classical, period, a, mummified, body, supposedly, that, of, huineng, is, kept, in, nanhua, temple, in, shaoguan, northern, guangdong, this, mummy, was, seen, by, the, jesuit, matteo, ricci, who, visited, nanhua, temple, in, 1589, ricci, told, the, european, readers, the, story, of, huineng, in, a, somewhat, edited, form, describing, him, as, akin, to, a, christian, ascetic, ricci, names, him, li, z, i, e, the, sixth, ancestor, during, the, cultural, revolution, the, mummy, was, damaged, by, the, red, guards, the, two, paintings, to, the, right, were, both, completed, by, liang, kai, a, painter, from, southern, song, dynasty, who, left, his, position, as, the, court, painter, in, jia, tai, s, court, to, practice, chan, these, paintings, depict, huineng, the, sixth, patriarch, of, chan, buddhism, the, protagonist, occupies, the, lower, central, portion, of, both, paintings, with, his, face, turned, to, the, side, so, that, his, facial, features, are, not, portrayed, the, sixth, patriarch, cutting, the, bamboo, depicts, the, process, that, huineng, went, through, to, attain, enlightenment, and, exemplifies, huineng, s, concentration, and, contemplation, in, doing, so, through, the, process, of, chopping, bamboo, this, particular, enlightenment, moment, of, his, is, only, documented, in, this, painting, and, not, in, any, literary, sources, he, holds, an, ax, in, his, right, hand, and, extends, his, left, arm, to, steady, a, stalk, of, bamboo, while, scrutinizing, it, the, brushstrokes, are, loose, and, free, but, construct, a, simplistic, and, lively, image, they, indicate, a, subtle, motion, of, pulling, the, bamboo, towards, him, huineng, wears, a, shirt, with, sleeves, rolled, up, which, is, suggested, by, the, crease, at, the, edges, of, the, shoulders, he, puts, his, extra, cloth, into, a, hair, bun, the, light, and, dark, ink, indicate, gradation, and, contrast, and, the, light, shadow, on, his, right, arm, and, body, of, bamboo, implies, the, source, of, light, similarly, the, sixth, patriarch, tearing, a, sutra, adopts, a, similar, style, in, portraying, the, same, figure, huineng, performing, a, different, mundane, action, this, reaffirms, the, focus, of, the, southern, chan, tradition, which, is, to, attain, sudden, enlightenment, without, having, to, train, to, be, a, monk, in, the, conventional, way, or, to, study, buddhist, scriptures, the, body, is, the, tree, of, enlightenment, the, mind, is, like, a, bright, mirror, s, stand, time, after, time, polish, it, diligently, so, that, no, dust, can, collect, enlightenment, is, not, a, tree, the, bright, mirror, has, no, stand, originally, there,
