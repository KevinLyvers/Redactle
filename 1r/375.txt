1797, in, d, sseldorf, in, what, was, then, the, duchy, of, berg, into, a, jewish, family, he, was, called, harry, in, childhood, but, became, known, as, heinrich, after, his, conversion, to,

marx, also, born, to, a, german, jewish, family, in, the, rhineland, with, whom, he, became, a, frequent, correspondent, in, later, life, d, sseldorf, at, the, time, was, a, town, with, a, population, of, around, 16, 000, the, french, revolution, and, subsequent, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, involving, germany, complicated, d, sseldorf, s, political, history, during, heine, s, childhood, it, had, been, the, capital, of, the, duchy, of, j, lich, berg, but, was, under, french, occupation, at, the, time, of, his, birth, it, then, passed, to, the, elector, of, bavaria, before, being, ceded, to, napoleon, in, 1806, who, turned, it, into, the, capital, of, the, grand, duchy, of, berg, one, of, three, french, states, he, established, in, germany, it, was, first, ruled, by, joachim, murat, then, by, napoleon, himself, upon, napoleon, s, downfall, in, 1815, it, became, part, of, prussia, thus, heine, s, formative, years, were, spent, under, french, influence, the, adult, heine, would, always, be, devoted, to, the, french, for, introducing, the, napoleonic, code, and, trial, by, jury, he, glossed, over, the, negative, aspects, of, french, rule, in, berg, heavy, taxation, conscription, and, economic, depression, brought, about, by, the, continental, blockade, which, may, have, contributed, to, his, father, s, bankruptcy, heine, greatly, admired, napoleon, as, the, promoter, of, revolutionary, ideals, of, liberty, and, equality, and, loathed, the, political, atmosphere, in, germany, after, napoleon, s, defeat, marked, by, the, conservative, policies, of, austrian, chancellor, klemens, von, metternich, who, attempted, to, reverse, the, effects, of, the, french, revolution, heine, s, parents, were, not, particularly, devout, they, sent, him, as, a, young, child, to, a, jewish, school, where, he, learned, a, smattering, of, hebrew, but, thereafter, he, attended, catholic, schools, here, he, learned, french, which, became, his, second, language, although, he, always, spoke, it, with, a, german, accent, he, also, acquired, a, lifelong, love, for, rhenish, folklore, in, 1814, heine, went, to, a, business, school, in, d, sseldorf, where, he, learned, to, read, english, the, commercial, language, of, the, time, the, most, successful, member, of, the, heine, family, was, his, uncle, salomon, heine, a, millionaire, banker, in, hamburg, in, 1816, heine, moved, to, hamburg, to, become, an, apprentice, at, heckscher, co, his, uncle, s, bank, but, displayed, little, aptitude, for, business, he, learned, to, hate, hamburg, with, its, commercial, ethos, but, it, would, become, one, of, the, poles, of, his, life, alongside, paris, when, he, was, 18, heine, almost, certainly, had, an, unrequited, love, for, his, cousin, amalie, salomon, s, daughter, whether, he, then, transferred, his, affections, equally, unsuccessfully, to, her, sister, therese, is, unknown, this, period, in, heine, s, life, is, not, clear, but, it, seems, that, his, father, s, business, deteriorated, making, samson, heine, effectively, the, ward, of, his, brother, salomon, salomon, realised, that, his, nephew, had, no, talent, for, trade, and, it, was, decided, that, heine, should, enter, law, so, in, 1819, heine, went, to, the, university, of, bonn, then, in, prussia, political, life, in, germany, was, divided, between, conservatives, and, liberals, the, conservatives, who, were, in, power, wanted, to, restore, things, to, the, way, they, were, before, the, french, revolution, they, were, against, german, unification, because, they, felt, a, united, germany, might, fall, victim, to, revolutionary, ideas, most, german, states, were, absolutist, monarchies, with, a, censored, press, the, opponents, of, the, conservatives, the, liberals, wanted, to, replace, absolutism, with, representative, constitutional, government, equality, before, the, law, and, a, free, press, at, the, university, of, bonn, liberal, students, were, at, war, with, the, conservative, authorities, heine, was, a, radical, liberal, and, one, of, the, first, things, he, did, after, his, arrival, was, to, take, part, in, a, parade, which, violated, the, carlsbad, decrees, a, series, of, measures, introduced, by, metternich, to, suppress, liberal, political, activity, heine, was, more, interested, in, studying, history, and, literature, than, law, the, university, had, engaged, the, famous, literary, critic, and, thinker, august, wilhelm, schlegel, as, a, lecturer, and, heine, heard, him, talk, about, the, nibelungenlied, and, romanticism, though, he, would, later, mock, schlegel, heine, found, in, him, a, sympathetic, critic, for, his, early, verses, heine, began, to, acquire, a, reputation, as, a, poet, at, bonn, he, also, wrote, two, tragedies, almansor, and, william, ratcliff, but, they, had, little, success, in, the, theatre, after, a, year, at, bonn, heine, left, to, continue, his, law, studies, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, heine, hated, the, town, it, was, part, of, hanover, then, also, rulers, of, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, power, heine, blamed, for, bringing, napoleon, down, here, the, poet, experienced, an, aristocratic, snobbery, absent, elsewhere, he, hated, law, as, the, historical, school, of, law, he, had, to, study, was, used, to, bolster, the, reactionary, form, of, government, he, opposed, other, events, conspired, to, make, heine, loathe, this, period, of, his, life, he, was, expelled, from, a, student, fraternity, due, to, anti, semitism, reasons, and, he, heard, the, news, that, his, cousin, amalie, had, become, engaged, when, heine, challenged, another, student, wiebel, to, a, duel, the, first, of, ten, known, incidents, throughout, his, life, the, authorities, stepped, in, and, he, was, suspended, from, the, university, for, six, months, his, uncle, then, decided, to, send, him, to, the, university, of, berlin, heine, arrived, in, berlin, in, march, 1821, it, was, the, biggest, most, cosmopolitan, city, he, had, ever, visited, its, population, was, about, 200, 000, the, university, gave, heine, access, to, notable, cultural, figures, as, lecturers, the, sanskritist, franz, bopp, and, the, homer, critic, f, a, wolf, who, inspired, heine, s, lifelong, love, of, aristophanes, most, important, was, the, philosopher, hegel, whose, influence, on, heine, is, hard, to, gauge, he, probably, gave, heine, and, other, young, students, the, idea, that, history, had, a, meaning, which, could, be, seen, as, progressive, heine, also, made, valuable, acquaintances, in, berlin, notably, the, liberal, karl, august, varnhagen, and, his, jewish, wife, rahel, who, held, a, leading, salon, another, friend, was, the, satirist, karl, immermann, who, had, praised, heine, s, first, verse, collection, gedichte, when, it, appeared, in, december, 1821, during, his, time, in, berlin, heine, also, joined, the, verein, f, r, cultur, und, wissenschaft, der, juden, a, society, which, attempted, to, achieve, a, balance, between, the, jewish, faith, and, modernity, since, heine, was, not, very, religious, in, outlook, he, soon, lost, interest, but, he, also, began, to, investigate, jewish, history, he, was, particularly, drawn, to, the, spanish, jews, of, the, middle, ages, in, 1824, heine, began, a, historical, novel, der, rabbi, von, bacherach, which, he, never, managed, to, finish, in, may, 1823, heine, left, berlin, for, good, and, joined, his, family, at, their, new, home, in, l, neburg, here, he, began, to, write, the, poems, of, the, cycle, die, heimkehr, the, homecoming, he, returned, to, g, ttingen, where, he, was, again, bored, by, the, law, in, september, 1824, he, decided, to, take, a, break, and, set, off, on, a, trip, through, the, harz, mountains, on, his, return, he, started, writing, an, account, of, it, die, harzreise, on, 28, june, 1825, heine, converted, to, protestantism, the, prussian, government, had, been, gradually, restoring, discrimination, against, jews, in, 1822, it, introduced, a, law, excluding, jews, from, academic, posts, and, heine, had, ambitions, for, a, university, career, as, heine, said, in, self, justification, his, conversion, was, the, ticket, of, admission, into, european, culture, in, any, event, heine, s, conversion, which, was, reluctant, never, brought, him, any, benefits, in, his, career, a, quarter, of, a, century, later, he, declared, i, make, no, secret, of, my, judaism, to, which, i, have, not, returned, because, i, never, left, it, heine, now, had, to, search, for, a, job, he, was, only, really, suited, to, writing, but, it, was, extremely, difficult, to, be, a, professional, writer, in, germany, the, market, for, literary, works, was, small, and, it, was, only, possible, to, make, a, living, by, writing, virtually, non, stop, heine, was, incapable, of, doing, this, so, he, never, had, enough, money, to, cover, his, expenses, before, finding, work, heine, visited, the, north, sea, resort, of, norderney, which, inspired, the, free, verse, poems, of, his, cycle, die, nordsee, in, hamburg, one, evening, in, january, 1826, heine, met, julius, campe, who, would, be, his, chief, publisher, for, the, rest, of, his, life, their, stormy, relationship, has, been, compared, to, a, marriage, campe, was, a, liberal, who, published, as, many, dissident, authors, as, he, could, he, had, developed, various, techniques, for, evading, the, authorities, the, laws, of, the, time, stated, that, any, book, under, 320, pages, had, to, be, submitted, to, censorship, the, authorities, thought, long, books, would, cause, little, trouble, as, they, were, unpopular, one, way, around, censorship, was, to, publish, dissident, works, in, large, print, to, increase, the, number, of, pages, beyond, 320, the, censorship, in, hamburg, was, relatively, lax, but, campe, had, to, worry, about, prussia, the, largest, german, state, and, largest, market, for, books, it, was, estimated, that, one, third, of, the, german, readership, was, prussian, initially, any, book, which, had, passed, the, censor, in, a, german, state, was, able, to, be, sold, in, any, of, the, other, states, but, in, 1834, this, loophole, was, closed, campe, was, reluctant, to, publish, uncensored, books, as, he, had, bad, experiences, with, print, runs, being, confiscated, heine, resisted, all, censorship, this, issue, became, a, bone, of, contention, between, the, two, however, the, relationship, between, author, and, publisher, started, well, campe, published, the, first, volume, of, reisebilder, travel, pictures, in, may, 1826, this, volume, included, die, harzreise, which, marked, a, new, style, of, german, travel, writing, mixing, romantic, descriptions, of, nature, with, satire, heine, s, buch, der, lieder, followed, in, 1827, this, was, a, collection, of, already, published, poems, no, one, expected, it, to, become, one, of, the, most, popular, books, of, german, verse, ever, published, and, sales, were, slow, to, start, with, picking, up, when, composers, began, setting, heine, s, poems, as, lieder, for, example, the, poem, alln, chtlich, im, traume, was, set, to, music, by, robert, schumann, and, felix, mendelssohn, it, contains, the, ironic, disillusionment, typical, of, heine, alln, chtlich, im, traume, seh, ich, dich, und, sehe, dich, freundlich, gr, en, und, laut, aufweinend, st, rz, ich, mich, zu, deinen, s, en, f, en, du, siehst, mich, an, wehm, tiglich, und, sch, ttelst, das, blonde, k, pfchen, aus, deinen, augen, schleichen, sich, die, perlentr, nentr, pfchen, du, sagst, mir, heimlich, ein, leises, wort, und, gibst, mir, den, strau, von, zypressen, ich, wache, auf, und, der, strau, ist, fort, und, das, wort, hab, ich, vergessen, nightly, i, see, you, in, dreams, you, speak, with, kindliness, sincerest, i, throw, myself, weeping, aloud, and, weak, at, your, sweet, feet, my, dearest, you, look, at, me, with, wistful, woe, and, shake, your, golden, curls, and, stealing, from, your, eyes, there, flow, the, teardrops, like, to, pearls, you, breathe, in, my, ear, a, secret, word, a, garland, of, cypress, for, token, i, wake, it, is, gone, the, dream, is, blurred, and, forgotten, the, word, that, was, spoken, poetic, translation, by, hal, draper, starting, from, the, mid, 1820s, heine, distanced, himself, from, romanticism, by, adding, irony, sarcasm, and, satire, into, his, poetry, and, making, fun, of, the, sentimental, romantic, awe, of, nature, and, of, figures, of, speech, in, contemporary, poetry, and, literature, an, example, are, these, lines, das, fr, ulein, stand, am, meere, und, seufzte, lang, und, bang, es, r, hrte, sie, so, sehre, der, sonnenuntergang, mein, fr, ulein, sein, sie, munter, das, ist, ein, altes, st, ck, hier, vorne, geht, sie, unter, und, kehrt, von, hinten, zur, ck, a, mistress, stood, by, the, sea, sighing, long, and, anxiously, she,

the, romantic, movement, also, received, withering, treatment, from, heine, during, this, period, as, illustrated, by, the, following, quatrains, from, lyrisches, intermezzo, am, kreuzweg, wird, begraben, wer, selber, brachte, sich, um, dort, w, chst, eine, blaue, blume, die, armes, nderblum, am, kreuzweg, stand, ich, und, seufzte, die, nacht, war, kalt, und, stumm, im, mondschein, bewegte, sich, langsam, die, armes, nderblum, at, the, cross, road, will, be, buried, he, who, killed, himself, there, grows, a, blue, flower, suicide, s, flower, i, stood, at, the, cross, road, and, sighed, the, night, was, cold, and, mute, by, the, light, of, the, moon, moved, slowly, suicide, s, flower, heine, became, increasingly, critical, of, despotism, and, reactionary, chauvinism, in, germany, of, nobility, and, clerics, but, also, what, he, viewed, as, narrow, mindedness, of, ordinary, people, and, of, the, rising, german, form, of, nationalism, especially, in, contrast, to, the, french, and, the, revolution, nevertheless, he, made, a, point, of, stressing, his, love, for, his, fatherland, plant, the, black, red, gold, banner, at, the, summit, of, the, german, idea, make, it, the, standard, of, free, mankind, and, i, will, shed, my, dear, heart, s, blood, for, it, rest, assured, i, love, the, fatherland, just, as, much, as, you, do, the, first, volume, of, travel, writings, was, such, a, success, that, campe, pressed, heine, for, another, reisebilder, ii, appeared, in, april, 1827, it, contains, the, second, cycle, of, north, sea, poems, a, prose, essay, on, the, north, sea, as, well, as, a, new, work, ideen, das, buch, le, grand, which, contains, the, following, satire, on, german, censorship, the, german, censors, idiots, heine, went, to, england, to, avoid, what, he, predicted, would, be, controversy, over, the, publication, of, this, work, in, london, he, cashed, a, cheque, from, his, uncle, for, 200, equal, to, 21, 870, today, much, to, salomon, s, chagrin, heine, was, unimpressed, by, the, english, he, found, them, commercial, and, prosaic, and, still, blamed, them, for, the, defeat, of, napoleon, on, his, return, to, germany, cotta, the, liberal, publisher, of, goethe, and, schiller, offered, heine, a, job, co, editing, a, magazine, politische, annalen, in, munich, heine, did, not, find, work, on, the, newspaper, congenial, and, instead, tried, to, obtain, a, professorship, at, munich, university, with, no, success, after, a, few, months, he, took, a, trip, to, northern, italy, visiting, lucca, florence, and, venice, but, was, forced, to, return, when, he, received, news, that, his, father, had, died, this, italian, journey, resulted, in, a, series, of, new, works, die, reise, von, m, nchen, nach, genua, journey, from, munich, to, genoa, die, b, der, von, lucca, the, baths, of, lucca, and, die, stadt, lucca, the, town, of, lucca, die, b, der, von, lucca, embroiled, heine, in, controversy, the, aristocratic, poet, august, von, platen, had, been, annoyed, by, some, epigrams, by, immermann, which, heine, had, included, in, the, second, volume, of, reisebilder, he, counter, attacked, by, writing, a, play, der, romantische, dipus, which, included, anti, semitic, jibes, about, heine, heine, was, stung, and, responded, by, mocking, platen, s, homosexuality, in, die, b, der, von, lucca, this, back, and, forth, ad, hominem, literary, polemic, has, become, known, as, the, platen, affair, heine, left, germany, for, france, in, 1831, settling, in, paris, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, his, move, was, prompted, by, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, that, had, made, louis, philippe, the, citizen, king, of, the, french, heine, shared, liberal, enthusiasm, for, the, revolution, which, he, felt, had, the, potential, to, overturn, the, conservative, political, order, in, europe, heine, was, also, attracted, by, the, prospect, of, freedom, from, german, censorship, and, was, interested, in, the, new, french, utopian, political, doctrine, of, saint, simonianism, saint, simonianism, preached, a, new, social, order, in, which, meritocracy, would, replace, hereditary, distinctions, in, rank, and, wealth, there, would, also, be, female, emancipation, and, an, important, role, for, artists, and, scientists, heine, frequented, some, saint, simonian, meetings, after, his, arrival, in, paris, but, within, a, few, years, his, enthusiasm, for, the, ideology, and, other, forms, of, utopianism, had, waned, heine, soon, became, a, celebrity, in, france, paris, offered, him, a, cultural, richness, unavailable, in, the, smaller, cities, of, germany, he, made, many, famous, acquaintances, the, closest, were, g, rard, de, nerval, and, hector, berlioz, but, he, always, remained, something, of, an, outsider, he, had, little, interest, in, french, literature, and, wrote, everything, in, german, subsequently, translating, it, into, french, with, the, help, of, a, collaborator, in, paris, heine, earned, money, working, as, the, french, correspondent, for, one, of, cotta, s, newspapers, the, allgemeine, zeitung, the, first, event, he, covered, was, the, salon, of, 1831, his, articles, were, eventually, collected, in, a, volume, entitled, franz, sische, zust, nde, conditions, in, france, heine, saw, himself, as, a, mediator, between, germany, and, france, if, the, two, countries, understood, one, another, there, would, be, progress, to, further, this, aim, he, published, de, l, allemagne, on, germany, in, french, begun, 1833, in, its, later, german, version, the, book, is, divided, into, two, zur, geschichte, der, religion, und, philosophie, in, deutschland, on, the, history, of, religion, and, philosophy, in, germany, and, die, romantische, schule, the, romantic, school, heine, was, deliberately, attacking, madame, de, sta, l, s, book, de, l, allemagne, 1813, which, he, viewed, as, reactionary, romantic, and, obscurantist, he, felt, de, sta, l, had, portrayed, a, germany, of, poets, and, thinkers, dreamy, religious, introverted, and, cut, off, from, the, revolutionary, currents, of, the, modern, world, heine, thought, that, such, an, image, suited, the, oppressive, german, authorities, he, also, had, an, enlightenment, view, of, the, past, seeing, it, as, mired, in, superstition, and, atrocities, religion, and, philosophy, in, germany, describes, the, replacement, of, traditional, spiritualist, religion, by, a, pantheism, that, pays, attention, to, human, material, needs, according, to, heine, pantheism, had, been, repressed, by, christianity, and, had, survived, in, german, folklore, he, predicted, that, german, thought, would, prove, a, more, explosive, force, than, the, french, revolution, heine, had, had, few, serious, love, affairs, but, in, late, 1834, he, made, the, acquaintance, of, a, 19, year, old, paris, shopgirl, crescence, eug, nie, mirat, whom, he, nicknamed, mathilde, heine, reluctantly, began, a, relationship, with, her, she, was, illiterate, knew, no, german, and, had, no, interest, in, cultural, or, intellectual, matters, nevertheless, she, moved, in, with, heine, in, 1836, and, lived, with, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, they, were, married, in, 1841, heine, and, his, fellow, radical, exile, in, paris, ludwig, b, rne, had, become, the, role, models, for, a, younger, generation, of, writers, who, were, given, the, name, young, germany, they, included, karl, gutzkow, heinrich, laube, theodor, mundt, and, ludolf, wienbarg, they, were, liberal, but, not, actively, political, nevertheless, they, still, fell, foul, of, the, authorities, in, 1835, gutzkow, published, a, novel, wally, die, zweiflerin, wally, the, sceptic, which, contained, criticism, of, the, institution, of, marriage, and, some, mildly, erotic, passages, in, november, of, that, year, the, german, diet, consequently, banned, publication, of, works, by, the, young, germans, in, germany, and, on, metternich, s, insistence, heine, s, name, was, added, to, their, number, heine, however, continued, to, comment, on, german, politics, and, society, from, a, distance, his, publisher, was, able, to, find, some, ways, of, getting, around, the, censors, and, he, was, still, free, of, course, to, publish, in, france, heine, s, relationship, with, his, fellow, dissident, ludwig, b, rne, was, troubled, since, b, rne, did, not, attack, religion, or, traditional, morality, like, heine, the, german, authorities, hounded, him, less, although, they, still, banned, his, books, as, soon, as, they, appeared, b, rne, was, the, idol, of, german, immigrant, workers, in, paris, he, was, also, a, republican, while, heine, was, not, heine, regarded, b, rne, with, his, admiration, for, robespierre, as, a, puritanical, neo, jacobin, and, remained, aloof, from, him, in, paris, which, upset, b, rne, who, began, to, criticise, him, mostly, semi, privately, in, february, 1837, b, rne, died, when, heine, heard, that, gutzkow, was, writing, a, biography, of, b, rne, he, began, work, on, his, own, severely, critical, memorial, of, the, man, when, the, book, was, published, in, 1840, it, was, universally, disliked, by, the, radicals, and, served, to, alienate, heine, from, his, public, even, his, enemies, admitted, that, b, rne, was, a, man, of, integrity, so, heine, s, ad, hominem, attacks, on, him, were, viewed, as, being, in, poor, taste, heine, had, made, personal, attacks, on, b, rne, s, closest, friend, jeanette, wohl, so, jeannette, s, husband, challenged, heine, to, a, duel, it, was, the, last, heine, ever, fought, he, received, a, flesh, wound, in, the, hip, before, fighting, he, decided, to, safeguard, mathilde, s, future, in, the, event, of, his, death, by, marrying, her, heine, continued, to, write, reports, for, cotta, s, allgemeine, zeitung, and, when, cotta, died, for, his, son, and, successor, one, event, which, really, galvanised, him, was, the, 1840, damascus, affair, in, which, jews, in, damascus, had, been, subject, to, blood, libel, and, accused, of, murdering, an, old, catholic, monk, this, led, to, a, wave, of, anti, semitic, persecution, the, french, government, aiming, at, imperialism, in, the, middle, east, and, not, wanting, to, offend, the, catholic, party, had, failed, to, condemn, the, outrage, in, contrast, the, austrian, consul, in, damascus, had, assiduously, exposed, the, blood, libel, as, a, fraud, for, heine, this, was, a, reversal, of, values, reactionary, austria, standing, up, for, the, jews, while, france, temporised, heine, responded, by, dusting, off, and, publishing, his, unfinished, novel, about, the, persecution, of, jews, in, the, middle, ages, der, rabbi, von, bacherach, german, poetry, took, a, more, directly, political, turn, when, the, new, frederick, william, iv, ascended, the, prussian, throne, in, 1840, initially, it, was, thought, he, might, be, a, popular, monarch, and, during, this, honeymoon, period, of, his, early, reign, 1840, 42, censorship, was, relaxed, this, led, to, the, emergence, of, popular, political, poets, so, called, tendenzdichter, including, hoffmann, von, fallersleben, author, of, deutschlandlied, the, german, anthem, ferdinand, freiligrath, and, georg, herwegh, heine, looked, down, on, these, writers, on, aesthetic, grounds, they, were, bad, poets, in, his, opinion, but, his, verse, of, the, 1840s, became, more, political, too, heine, s, mode, was, satirical, attack, against, the, kings, of, bavaria, and, prussia, he, never, for, one, moment, shared, the, belief, that, frederick, william, iv, might, be, more, liberal, against, the, political, torpor, of, the, german, people, and, against, the, greed, and, cruelty, of, the, ruling, class, the, most, popular, of, heine, s, political, poems, was, his, least, typical, die, schlesischen, weber, the, silesian, weavers, based, on, the, uprising, of, weavers, in, peterswaldau, in, 1844, in, october, 1843, heine, s, distant, relative, and, german, revolutionary, karl, marx, and, his, wife, jenny, von, westphalen, arrived, in, paris, after, the, prussian, government, had, suppressed, marx, s, radical, newspaper, the, marx, family, settled, in, rue, vaneau, marx, was, an, admirer, of, heine, and, his, early, writings, show, heine, s, influence, in, december, heine, met, the, marxes, and, got, on, well, with, them, he, published, several, poems, including, die, schlesischen, weber, in, marx, s, new, journal, vorw, rts, forwards, ultimately, heine, s, ideas, of, revolution, through, sensual, emancipation, and, marx, s, scientific, socialism, were, incompatible, but, both, writers, shared, the, same, negativity, and, lack, of, faith, in, the, bourgeoisie, in, the, isolation, he, felt, after, the, b, rne, debacle, marx, s, friendship, came, as, a, relief, to, heine, since, he, did, not, really, like, the, other, radicals, on, the, other, hand, he, did, not, share, marx, s, faith, in, the, industrial, proletariat, and, remained, on, the, fringes, of, socialist, circles, the, prussian, government, angry, at, the, publication, of, vorw, rts, put, pressure, on, france, to, deal, with, its, authors, and, marx, was, deported, to, belgium, in, january, 1845, heine, could, not, be, expelled, from, the, country, because, he, had, the, right, of, residence, in, france, having, been, born, under, french, occupation, thereafter, heine, and, marx, maintained, a, sporadic, correspondence, but, in, time, their, admiration, for, each, other, faded, heine, always, had, mixed, feelings, about, communism, he, believed, its, radicalism, and, materialism, would, destroy, much, of, the, european, culture, that, he, loved, and, admired, in, the, french, edition, of, lutetia, heine, wrote, one, year, before, he, died, this, confession, that, the, future, belongs, to, the, communists, i, made, with, an, undertone, of, the, greatest, fear, and, sorrow, and, oh, this, undertone, by, no, means, is, a, mask, indeed, with, fear, and, terror, i, imagine, the, time, when, those, dark, iconoclasts, come, to, power, with, their, raw, fists, they, will, batter, all, marble, images, of, my, beloved, world, of, art, they, will, ruin, all, those, fantastic, anecdotes, that, the, poets, loved, so, much, they, will, chop, down, my, laurel, forests, and, plant, potatoes, and, oh, the, herbs, chandler, will, use, my, book, of, songs, to, make, bags, for, coffee, and, snuff, for, the, old, women, of, the, future, oh, i, can, foresee, all, this, and, i, feel, deeply, sorry, thinking, of, this, decline, threatening, my, poetry, and, the, old, world, order, and, yet, i, freely, confess, the, same, thoughts, have, a, magical, appeal, upon, my, soul, which, i, cannot, resist, in, my, chest, there, are, two, voices, in, their, favour, which, cannot, be, silenced, because, the, first, one, is, that, of, logic, and, as, i, cannot, object, to, the, premise, that, all, people, have, the, right, to, eat, i, must, defer, to, all, the, conclusions, the, second, of, the, two, compelling, voices, of, which, i, am, talking, is, even, more, powerful, than, the, first, because, it, is, the, voice, of, hatred, the, hatred, i, dedicate, to, this, common, enemy, that, constitutes, the, most, distinctive, contrast, to, communism, and, that, will, oppose, the, angry, giant, already, at, the, first, instance, i, am, talking, about, the, party, of, the, so, called, advocates, of, nationality, in, germany, about, those, false, patriots, whose, love, for, the, fatherland, only, exists, in, the, shape, of, imbecile, distaste, of, foreign, countries, and, neighbouring, peoples, and, who, daily, pour, their, bile, especially, on, france, in, october, december, 1843, heine, made, a, journey, to, hamburg, to, see, his, aged, mother, and, to, patch, things, up, with, campe, with, whom, he, had, had, a, quarrel, he, was, reconciled, with, the, publisher, who, agreed, to, provide, mathilde, with, an, annuity, for, the, rest, of, her, life, after, heine, s, death, heine, repeated, the, trip, with, his, wife, in, july, october, 1844, to, see, uncle, salomon, but, this, time, things, did, not, go, so, well, it, was, the, last, time, heine, left, france, at, the, time, heine, was, working, on, two, linked, but, antithetical, poems, with, shakespearean, titles, deutschland, ein, winterm, rchen, germany, a, winter, s, tale, and, atta, troll, ein, sommernachtstraum, atta, troll, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, the, former, is, based, on, his, journey, to, germany, in, late, 1843, and, outdoes, the, radical, poets, in, its, satirical, attacks, on, the, political, situation, in, the, country, atta, troll, actually, begun, in, 1841, after, a, trip, to, the, pyrenees, mocks, the, literary, failings, heine, saw, in, the, radical, poets, particularly, freiligrath, it, tells, the, story, of, the, hunt, for, a, runaway, bear, atta, troll, who, symbolises, many, of, the, attitudes, heine, despised, including, a, simple, minded, egalitarianism, and, a, religious, view, which, makes, god, in, the, believer, s, image, atta, troll, conceives, god, as, an, enormous, heavenly, polar, bear, atta, troll, s, cubs, embody, the, nationalistic, views, heine, loathed, atta, troll, was, not, published, until, 1847, but, deutschland, appeared, in, 1844, as, part, of, a, collection, neue, gedichte, new, poems, which, gathered, all, the, verse, heine, had, written, since, 1831, in, the, same, year, uncle, salomon, died, this, put, a, stop, to, heine, s, annual, subsidy, of, 4, 800, francs, salomon, left, heine, and, his, brothers, 8, 000, francs, each, in, his, will, heine, s, cousin, carl, the, inheritor, of, salomon, s, business, offered, to, pay, him, 2, 000, francs, a, year, at, his, discretion, heine, was, furious, he, had, expected, much, more, from, the, will, and, his, campaign, to, make, carl, revise, its, terms, occupied, him, for, the, next, two, years, in, 1844, heine, wrote, series, of, musical, feuilletons, over, several, different, music, seasons, discussing, the, music, of, the, day, his, review, of, the, musical, season, of, 1844, written, in, paris, on, 25, april, of, that, year, is, his, first, reference, to, lisztomania, the, intense, fan, frenzy, directed, toward, franz, liszt, during, his, performances, however, heine, was, not, always, honorable, in, his, musical, criticism, that, same, month, he, wrote, to, liszt, suggesting, that, he, might, like, to, look, at, a, newspaper, review, he, had, written, of, liszt, s, performance, before, his, concert, he, indicated, that, it, contained, comments, liszt, would, not, like, liszt, took, this, as, an, attempt, to, extort, money, for, a, positive, review, and, did, not, meet, heine, heine, s, review, subsequently, appeared, on, 25, april, in, musikalische, berichte, aus, paris, and, attributed, liszt, s, success, to, lavish, expenditures, on, bouquets, and, to, the, wild, behaviour, of, his, hysterical, female, fans, liszt, then, broke, relations, with, heine, liszt, was, not, the, only, musician, to, be, blackmailed, by, heine, for, the, nonpayment, of, appreciation, money, meyerbeer, had, both, lent, and, given, money, to, heine, but, after, refusing, to, hand, over, a, further, 500, francs, was, repaid, by, being, dubbed, a, music, corrupter, in, heine, s, poem, die, menge, tut, es, in, may, 1848, heine, who, had, not, been, well, suddenly, fell, paralyzed, and, had, to, be, confined, to, bed, he, would, not, leave, what, he, called, his, mattress, grave, matratzengruft, until, his, death, eight, years, later, he, also, experienced, difficulties, with, his, eyes, it, had, been, suggested, that, he, suffered, from, multiple, sclerosis, or, syphilis, although, in, 1997, it, was, confirmed, through, an, analysis, of, the, poet, s, hair, that, he, had, suffered, from, chronic, lead, poisoning, he, bore, his, sufferings, stoically, and, he, won, much, public, sympathy, for, his, plight, his, illness, meant, he, paid, less, attention, than, he, might, otherwise, have, done, to, the, revolutions, which, broke, out, in, france, and, germany, in, 1848, he, was, sceptical, about, the, frankfurt, assembly, and, continued, to, attack, the, king, of, prussia, when, the, revolution, collapsed, heine, resumed, his, oppositional, stance, at, first, he, had, some, hope, louis, napoleon, might, be, a, good, leader, in, france, but, he, soon, began, to, share, the, opinion, of, marx, towards, him, as, the, new, emperor, began, to, crack, down, on, liberalism, and, socialism, in, 1848, heine, also, returned, to, religious, faith, in, fact, he, had, never, claimed, to, be, an, atheist, nevertheless, he, remained, sceptical, of, organised, religion, he, continued, to, work, from, his, sickbed, on, the, collections, of, poems, romanzero, and, gedichte, 1853, und, 1854, on, the, journalism, collected, in, lutezia, and, on, his, unfinished, memoirs, during, these, final, years, heine, had, a, love, affair, with, the, young, camille, selden, who, visited, him, regularly, he, died, on, 17, february, 1856, and, was, interred, in, the, paris, cimeti, re, de, montmartre, his, tomb, was, designed, by, danish, sculptor, louis, hasselriis, it, includes, heine, s, poem, where, german, wo, engraved, on, three, sides, of, the,

love, of, war, but, it, could, not, destroy, it, should, that, subduing, talisman, the, cross, be, shattered, the, frenzied, madness, of, the, ancient, warriors, that, insane, berserk, rage, of,

attack, him, within, the, pantheon, of, the, jewish, cultural, intelligentsia, chosen, for, anti, semitic, demonization, perhaps, nobody, was, the, recipient, of, more, national, socialist, vitriol, than, heinrich, heine, when, a, memorial, to, heine, was, completed, in, 1926, the, paper, lamented, that, hamburg, had, erected, a, jewish, monument, to, heine, and, damascus, one, in, which, alljuda, ruled, editors, for, the, v, lkischer, beobachter, referred, to, heine, s, writing, as, degenerate, on, multiple, occasions, as, did, alfred, rosenberg, correspondingly, as, part, of, the, effort, to, dismiss, and, hide, jewish, contribution, to, german, art, and, culture, all, heine, monuments, were, removed, or, destroyed, during, nazi, germany, and, heine, s, books, were, suppressed, and, from, 1940, on, banned, the, popularity, of, many, songs, to, heine, s, lyrics, represented, a, problem, for, the, policy, of, silencing, and, proposals, such, as, bans, or, rewriting, the, lyrics, were, discussed, however, in, contrast, to, an, often, made, claim, there, is, no, evidence, that, poems, such, as, die, lorelei, were, included, in, anthologies, as, written, by, an, unknown, author, many, composers, have, set, heine, s, works, to, music, they, include, robert, schumann, especially, his, lieder, cycle, dichterliebe, friedrich, silcher, who, wrote, a, popular, setting, of,

i, was, walking, along, the, small, street, on, the, left, bank, where, delacroix, s, studio, is, just, as, it, was, more, than, a, century, ago, i, d, read, his, journals, where, he, tells, of, chopin, going, for, a, drive, the, poet, heine, dropping, in, a, refugee, from, germany, nothing, had, changed, in, the, street, and, i, saw, heine, up, at, the, corner, walking, toward, me, he, almost, reached, me, i, had, this, intense, feeling, for, him, you, know, the, jewish, exile, i, saw, him, then, i, went, back, to, my, place, and, wrote, my, work, i, met, heine, on, the, rue, f, rstemberg, in, the, 1890s, amidst, a, flowering, of, affection, for, heine, leading, up, to, the, centennial, of, his, birth, plans, were, made, to, honor, heine, with, a, memorial, these, were, strongly, supported, by, one, of, heine, s, greatest, admirers, elisabeth, of, bavaria, empress, of, austria, the, empress, commissioned, a, statue, from, the, sculptor, louis, hasselriis, this, statue, originally, located, at, achilleion, empress, elisabeth, s, palace, in, corfu, was, later, removed, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, after, he, acquired, achilleion, in, 1907, but, it, eventually, found, a, home, in, toulon, this, became, the, inspiration, for, tony, harrison, s, 1992, film, poem, the, gaze, of, the, gorgon, another, memorial, a, sculpted, fountain, was, commissioned, for, d, sseldorf, while, at, first, the, plan, met, with, enthusiasm, the, concept, was, gradually, bogged, down, in, anti, semitic, nationalist, and, religious, criticism, by, the, time, the, fountain, was, finished, there, was, no, place, to, put, it, through, the, intervention, of, german, american, activists, the, memorial, was, ultimately, transplanted, into, the, bronx, new, york, city, in, philadelphia, already, in, 1855, was, printed, the, complete, edition, of, heine, s, works, in, german, language, while, the, memorial, is, known, in, english, as, the, lorelei, fountain, germans,

with, a, boulevard, heinrich, heine, allee, and, a, modern, monument, in, israel, the, attitude, to, heine, has, long, been, the, subject, of, debate, between, secularists, who, number, him, among, the, most, prominent, figures, of, jewish, history, and, the, religious, who, consider, his, conversion, to, christianity, to, be, an, unforgivable, act, of, betrayal, due, to, such, debates, the, city, of, tel, aviv, delayed, naming, a, street, for, heine, and, the, street, finally, chosen, to, bear, his, name, is, located, in, a, rather, desolate, industrial, zone, rather, than, in, the, vicinity, of, tel, aviv, university, suggested, by, some, public, figures, as, the, appropriate, location, ha, ir, the, city, a, left, leaning, tel, aviv, magazine, sarcastically, suggested, that, the, exiling, of, heine, street, symbolically, re, enacted, the, course, of, heine, s, own, life, since, then, a, street, in, the, yemin, moshe, neighborhood, of, jerusalem, and, in, haifa, a, street,
