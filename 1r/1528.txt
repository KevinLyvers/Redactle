something, of, a, bully, as, he, himself, recalled, i, was, a, dreadful, little, boy, i, don, t, suppose, anybody, would, put, up, with, my, sort, of, behaviour, these, days, later, in, life,

to, fire, and, montgomery, was, hit, once, more, in, the, knee, but, the, dead, soldier, in, montgomery, s, words, received, many, bullets, meant, for, me, assuming, them, to, both, be, dead, the, officers, and, men, of, montgomery, s, battalion, chose, to, leave, them, where, they, were, until, darkness, arrived, and, stretcher, bearers, managed, to, recover, the, two, bodies, with, montgomery, by, this, time, barely, clinging, on, to, life, the, doctors, at, the, advanced, dressing, station, too, had, no, hope, for, him, and, ordered, a, grave, to, be, dug, miraculously, however, montgomery, was, still, alive, and, after, being, placed, in, an, ambulance, and, then, being, sent, to, a, hospital, was, treated, and, eventually, evacuated, to, england, where, he, would, remain, for, well, over, a, year, he, was, appointed, a, companion, of, the, distinguished, service, order, for, his, gallant, leadership, during, this, period, the, citation, for, this, award,

as, gso1, effectively, chief, of, staff, of, the, 47th, 2nd, london, division, with, the, temporary, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, a, photograph, from, october, 1918, reproduced, in, many, biographies, shows, the, then, unknown, lieutenant, colonel, montgomery, standing, in, front, of, winston, churchill, then, the, minister, of, munitions, at, the, parade, following, the, liberation, of, lille, montgomery, was, profoundly, influenced, by, his, experiences, during, the, war, in, particular, by, the, leadership, or, rather, the, lack, of, it, being, displayed, by, the, senior, commanders, he, later, wrote, there, was, little, contact, between, the, generals, and, the, soldiers, i, went, through, the, whole, war, on, the, western, front, except, during, the, period, i, was, in, england, after, being, wounded, i, never, once, saw, the, british, commander, in, chief, neither, french, nor, haig, and, only, twice, did, i, see, an, army, commander, the, higher, staffs, were, out, of, touch, with, the, regimental, officers, and, with, the, troops, the, former, lived, in, comfort, which, became, greater, as, the, distance, of, their, headquarters, behind, the, lines, increased, there, was, no, harm, in, this, provided, there, was, touch, and, sympathy, between, the, staff, and, the, troops, this, was, often, lacking, at, most, large, headquarters, in, back, areas, the, doctrine, seemed, to, me, to, be, that, the, troops, existed, for, the, benefit, of, the, staff, my, war, experience, led, me, to, believe, that, the, staff, must, be, the, servant, of, the, troops, and, that, a, good, staff, officer, must, serve, his, commander, and, the, troops, but, himself, be, anonymous, the, frightful, casualties, appalled, me, the, so, called, good, fighting, generals, of, the, war, appeared, to, me, to, be, those, who, had, a, complete, disregard, for, human, life, there, were, of, course, exceptions, and, i, suppose, one, such, was, plumer, i, had, only, once, seen, him, and, had, never, spoken, to, him, after, the, first, world, war, montgomery, commanded, the, 17th, service, battalion, of, the, royal, fusiliers, a, battalion, in, the, british, army, of, the, rhine, before, reverting, to, his, substantive, rank, of, captain, brevet, major, in, november, 1919, he, had, not, at, first, been, selected, for, the, staff, college, in, camberley, surrey, his, only, hope, of, ever, achieving, high, command, but, at, a, tennis, party, in, cologne, he, was, able, to, persuade, the, commander, in, chief, c, in, c, of, the, british, army, of, occupation, field, marshal, sir, william, robertson, to, add, his, name, to, the, list, after, graduating, from, the, staff, college, he, was, appointed, brigade, major, in, the, 17th, infantry, brigade, in, january, 1921, the, brigade, was, stationed, in, county, cork, ireland, carrying, out, counter, guerilla, operations, during, the, final, stages, of, the, irish, war, of, independence, montgomery, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, conflict, could, not, be, won, without, harsh, measures, and, that, self, government, for, ireland, was, the, only, feasible, solution, in, 1923, after, the, establishment, of, the, irish, free, state, and, during, the, irish, civil, war, montgomery, wrote, to, colonel, arthur, ernest, percival, of, the, essex, regiment, personally, my, whole, attention, was, given, to, defeating, the, rebels, but, it, never, bothered, me, a, bit, how, many, houses, were, burnt, i, think, i, regarded, all, civilians, as, shinners, and, i, never, had, any, dealings, with, any, of, them, my, own, view, is, that, to, win, a, war, of, this, sort, you, must, be, ruthless, oliver, cromwell, or, the, germans, would, have, settled, it, in, a, very, short, time, nowadays, public, opinion, precludes, such, methods, the, nation, would, never, allow, it, and, the, politicians, would, lose, their, jobs, if, they, sanctioned, it, that, being, so, i, consider, that, lloyd, george, was, right, in, what, he, did, if, we, had, gone, on, we, could, probably, have, squashed, the, rebellion, as, a, temporary, measure, but, it, would, have, broken, out, again, like, an, ulcer, the, moment, we, removed, the, troops, i, think, the, rebels, would, probably, have, refused, battles, and, hidden, their, arms, etc, until, we, had, gone, the, only, way, therefore, was, to, give, them, some, form, of, self, government, and, let, them, squash, the, rebellion, themselves, they, are, the, only, people, who, could, really, stamp, it, out, in, one, noteworthy, incident, on, 2, may, 1922, montgomery, led, a, force, of, 60, soldiers, and, 4, armoured, cars, to, the, town, of, macroom, to, search, for, four, british, officers, who, were, missing, in, the, area, while, he, had, hoped, the, show, of, force, would, assist, in, finding, the, men, he, was, under, strict, orders, not, to, attack, the, ira, on, arriving, in, the, town, square, in, front, of, macroom, castle, he, summoned, the, ira, commander, charlie, browne, to, parley, at, the, castle, gates, montgomery, spoke, to, browne, explaining, what, would, happen, should, the, officers, not, be, released, once, finished, browne, responded, with, his, own, ultimatum, to, montgomery, to, leave, town, within, 10, minutes, browne, then, turned, heels, and, returned, to, the, castle, at, this, point, another, ira, officer, pat, o, sullivan, whistled, to, montgomery, drawing, his, attention, to, scores, of, ira, volunteers, who, had, quietly, taken, up, firing, positions, all, around, the, square, surrounding, montgomery, s, forces, realising, his, precarious, position, montgomery, led, his, troops, out, of, the, town, a, decision, which, raised, hostile, questions, in, the, house, of, commons, but, was, later, approved, by, montgomery, s, own, superiors, unknown, to, montgomery, at, this, time, the, four, missing, officers, had, already, been, executed, in, may, 1923, montgomery, was, posted, to, the, 49th, west, riding, infantry, division, a, territorial, army, ta, formation, he, returned, to, the, 1st, battalion, royal, warwickshire, regiment, in, 1925, as, a, company, commander, and, was, promoted, to, major, in, july, 1925, from, january, 1926, to, january, 1929, he, served, as, deputy, assistant, adjutant, general, at, the, staff, college, camberley, in, the, temporary, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, in, 1925, in, his, first, known, courtship, of, a, woman, montgomery, then, in, his, late, thirties, proposed, to, a, 17, year, old, girl, betty, anderson, his, approach, included, drawing, diagrams, in, the, sand, of, how, he, would, deploy, his, tanks, and, infantry, in, a, future, war, a, contingency, which, seemed, very, remote, at, that, time, she, respected, his, ambition, and, single, mindedness, but, declined, his, proposal, in, 1927, he, met, and, married, elizabeth, betty, carver, n, e, hobart, she, was, the, sister, of, the, future, second, world, war, commander, sir, percy, hobart, betty, carver, had, two, sons, in, their, early, teens, john, and, dick, from, her, first, marriage, to, oswald, carver, dick, carver, later, wrote, that, it, had, been, a, very, brave, thing, for, montgomery, to, take, on, a, widow, with, two, children, montgomery, s, son, david, was, born, in, august, 1928, while, on, holiday, in, burnham, on, sea, in, somerset, in, 1937, betty, suffered, an, insect, bite, which, became, infected, and, she, died, in, her, husband, s, arms, from, septicaemia, following, amputation, of, her, leg, the, loss, devastated, montgomery, who, was, then, serving, as, a, brigadier, but, he, insisted, on, throwing, himself, back, into, his, work, immediately, after, the, funeral, montgomery, s, marriage, had, been, extremely, happy, much, of, his, correspondence, with, his, wife, was, destroyed, when, his, quarters, at, portsmouth, were, bombed, during, the, second, world, war, after, montgomery, s, death, john, carver, wrote, that, his, mother, had, arguably, done, the, country, a, favour, by, keeping, his, personal, oddities, his, extreme, single, mindedness, and, his, intolerance, of, and, suspicion, of, the, motives, of, others, within, reasonable, bounds, long, enough, for, him, to, have, a, chance, of, attaining, high, command, both, of, montgomery, s, stepsons, became, army, officers, in, the, 1930s, both, were, serving, in, india, at, the, time, of, their, mother, s, death, and, both, served, in, the, second, world, war, each, eventually, attaining, the, rank, of, colonel, while, serving,

that, parcels, be, sent, to, him, like, many, british, pows, the, most, famous, being, general, richard, o, connor, dick, carver, escaped, in, september, 1943, during, the, brief, hiatus, between, italy, s, departure, from, the, war, and, the, german, seizure, of, the, country, he, eventually, reached, british, lines, on, 5, december, 1943, to, the, delight, of, his, stepfather, who, sent, him, home, to, britain, to, recuperate, in, january, 1929, montgomery, was, promoted, to, brevet, lieutenant, colonel, that, month, he, returned, to, the, 1st, battalion, royal, warwickshire, regiment,

to, britain, suffering, a, serious, illness, on, the, way, to, command, the, 3rd, infantry, division, reporting, the, suppression, of, the, revolt, in, april, 1939, montgomery, wrote, i, shall, be, sorry, to, leave, palestine, in, many, ways, as, i, have, enjoyed, the, war, out, here, britain, declared, war, on, germany, on, 3, september, 1939, and, the, 3rd, division, together, with, its, new, general, officer, commanding, goc, was, deployed, to, france, as, part, of, the, british, expeditionary, force, bef, commanded, by, general, lord, gort, shortly, after, the, division, s, arrival, overseas, montgomery, faced, serious, trouble, from, his, military, superiors, and, the, clergy, for, his, frank, attitude, regarding, the, sexual, health, of, his, soldiers, but, was, defended, from, dismissal, by, his, superior, alan, brooke, commander, of, ii, corps, of, which, montgomery, s, division, formed, a, part, montgomery, had, issued, a, circular, on, the, prevention, of, venereal, disease, worded, in, such, obscene, language, that, both, the, church, of, england, and, roman, catholic, senior, chaplains, objected, brooke, told, monty, that, he, did, not, want, any, further, errors, of, this, kind, though, deciding, not, to, get, him, to, formally, withdraw, it, as, it, would, remove, any, vestige, of, respect, left, for, him, although, montgomery, s, new, command, was, a, regular, army, formation, comprising, the, 7th, guards, and, the, 8th, and, 9th, infantry, brigades, along, with, supporting, units, he, was, not, impressed, with, its, readiness, for, battle, as, a, result, while, most, of, the, rest, of, the, bef, set, about, preparing, defences, for, an, expected, german, attack, sometime, in, the, future, montgomery, began, training, his, 3rd, division, in, offensive, tactics, organising, several, exercises, each, of, which, lasted, for, several, days, at, a, time, mostly, they, revolved, around, the, division, advancing, towards, an, objective, often, a, river, line, only, to, come, under, attack, and, forced, to, withdraw, to, another, position, usually, behind, another, river, these, exercises, usually, occurred, at, night, with, only, very, minimal, lighting, being, allowed, by, the, spring, of, 1940, montgomery, s, division, had, gained, a, reputation, of, being, a, very, agile, and, flexible, formation, by, then, the, allies, had, agreed, to, plan, d, where, they, would, advance, deep, into, belgium, and, take, up, positions, on, the, river, dyle, by, the, time, the, german, forces, attacked, brooke, montgomery, s, corps, commander, was, pessimistic, about, the, plan, but, montgomery, in, contrast, was, not, concerned, believing, that, he, and, his, division, would, perform, well, regardless, of, the, circumstances, particularly, in, a, war, of, movement, montgomery, s, training, paid, off, when, the, germans, began, their, invasion, of, the, low, countries, on, 10, may, 1940, and, the, 3rd, division, advanced, to, its, planned, position, near, the, belgian, city, of, louvain, soon, after, arrival, the, division, was, fired, on, by, members, of, the, belgian, 10th, infantry, division, who, mistook, them, for, german, paratroopers, montgomery, resolved, the, incident, by, approaching, them, and, offering, to, place, himself, under, belgian, command, although, montgomery, himself, took, control, when, the, germans, arrived, during, this, time, he, began, to, develop, a, particular, habit, which, he, would, keep, throughout, the, war, of, going, to, bed, at, 21, 30, every, night, without, fail, and, giving, only, a, single, order, that, he, was, not, to, be, disturbed, which, was, only, very, rarely, disobeyed, the, 3rd, division, saw, comparatively, little, action, but, owing, to, the, strict, training, methods, of, montgomery, the, division, always, managed, to, be, in, the, right, place, at, the, right, time, especially, so, during, the, retreat, into, france, by, 27, may, when, the, belgian, army, on, the, left, flank, of, the, bef, began, to, disintegrate, the, 3rd, division, achieved, something, very, difficult, the, movement, at, night, from, the, right, to, the, left, of, another, division, and, only, 2, 000, yards, behind, it, this, was, performed, with, great, professionalism, and, occurred, without, any, incidents, and, thereby, filled, a, very, vulnerable, gap, in, the, bef, s, defensive, line, on, 29, 30, may, montgomery, temporarily, took, over, from, brooke, who, received, orders, to, return, to, the, united, kingdom, as, goc, of, ii, corps, for, the, final, stages, of, the, dunkirk, evacuation, the, 3rd, division, temporarily, commanded, by, kenneth, anderson, in, montgomery, s, absence, returned, to, britain, intact, with, minimal, casualties, operation, dynamo, codename, for, the, dunkirk, evacuation, saw, 330, 000, allied, military, personnel, including, most, of, the, bef, to, britain, although, the, bef, was, forced, to, leave, behind, a, significant, amount, of, equipment, on, his, return, montgomery, antagonised, the, war, office, with, trenchant, criticisms, of, the, command, of, the, bef, and, was, briefly, relegated, to, divisional, command, of, 3rd, division, which, was, the, only, fully, equipped, division, in, britain, he, was, made, a, companion, of, the, order, of, the, bath, montgomery, was, ordered, to, make, ready, the, 3rd, division, to, invade, the, neutral, portuguese, azores, models, of, the, islands, were, prepared, and, detailed, plans, worked, out, for, the, invasion, the, invasion, plans, did, not, go, ahead, and, plans, switched, to, invading, cape, verde, island, also, belonging, to, neutral, portugal, these, invasion, plans, also, did, not, go, ahead, montgomery, was, then, ordered, to, prepare, plans, for, the, invasion, of, neutral, ireland, and, to, seize, cork, cobh, and, cork, harbour, these, invasion, plans, like, those, of, the, portuguese, islands, also, did, not, go, ahead, and, in, july, 1940, montgomery, was, appointed, acting, lieutenant, general, and, after, handing, over, command, of, his, division, to, james, gammell, he, was, placed, in, command, of, v, corps, responsible, for, the, defence, of, hampshire, and, dorset, and, started, a, long, running, feud, with, the, new, commander, in, chief, c, in, c, of, southern, command, lieutenant, general, claude, auchinleck, in, april, 1941, he, became, commander, of, xii, corps, responsible, for, the, defence, of, kent, during, this, period, he, instituted, a, regime, of, continuous, training, and, insisted, on, high, levels, of, physical, fitness, for, both, officers, and, other, ranks, he, was, ruthless, in, sacking, officers, he, considered, unfit, for, command, in, action, promoted, to, temporary, lieutenant, general, in, july, overseeing, the, defence, of, kent, sussex, and, surrey, in, december, montgomery, was, given, command, of, south, eastern, command, he, renamed, his, command, the, south, eastern, army, to, promote, offensive, spirit, during, this, time, he, further, developed, and, rehearsed, his, ideas, and, trained, his, soldiers, culminating, in, exercise, tiger, in, may, 1942, a, combined, forces, exercise, involving, 100, 000, troops, in, 1942, a, new, field, commander, was, required, in, the, middle, east, where, auchinleck, was, fulfilling, both, the, role, of, c, in, c, of, middle, east, command, and, commander, eighth, army, he, had, stabilised, the, allied, position, at, the, first, battle, of, el, alamein, but, after, a, visit, in, august, 1942, the, prime, minister, winston, churchill, replaced, him, as, c, in, c, with, general, sir, harold, alexander, and, william, gott, as, commander, of, the, eighth, army, in, the, western, desert, however, after, gott, was, killed, flying, back, to, cairo, churchill, was, persuaded, by, brooke, who, by, this, time, was, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, cigs, to, appoint, montgomery, who, had, only, just, been, nominated, to, replace, alexander, as, commander, of, the, british, first, army, for, operation, torch, the, invasion, of, french, north, africa, a, story, probably, apocryphal, but, popular, at, the, time, is, that, the, appointment, caused, montgomery, to, remark, that, after, having, an, easy, war, things, have, now, got, much, more, difficult, a, colleague, is, supposed, to, have, told, him, to, cheer, up, at, which, point, montgomery, said, i, m, not, talking, about, me, i, m, talking, about, rommel, montgomery, s, assumption, of, command, transformed, the, fighting, spirit, and, abilities, of, the, eighth, army, taking, command, on, 13, august, 1942, he, immediately, became, a, whirlwind, of, activity, he, ordered, the, creation, of, the, x, corps, which, contained, all, armoured, divisions, to, fight, alongside, his, xxx, corps, which, was, all, infantry, divisions, this, arrangement, differed, from, the, german, panzer, corps, one, of, rommel, s, panzer, corps, combined, infantry, armour, and, artillery, units, under, one, corps, commander, the, only, common, commander, for, montgomery, s, all, infantry, and, all, armour, corps, was, the, eighth, army, commander, himself, writing, post, war, the, english, historian, correlli, barnett, commented, that, montgomery, s, solution, was, in, every, way, opposite, to, auchinleck, s, and, in, every, way, wrong, for, it, carried, the, existing, dangerous, separatism, still, further, montgomery, reinforced, the, 30, miles, 48, km, long, front, line, at, el, alamein, something, that, would, take, two, months, to, accomplish, he, asked, alexander, to, send, him, two, new, british, divisions, 51st, highland, and, 44th, home, counties, that, were, then, arriving, in, egypt, and, were, scheduled, to, be, deployed, in, defence, of, the, nile, delta, he, moved, his, field, hq, to, burg, al, arab, close, to, the, air, force, command, post, in, order, to, better, coordinate, combined, operations, montgomery, was, determined, that, the, army, navy, and, air, forces, should, fight, their, battles, in, a, unified, focused, manner, according, to, a, detailed, plan, he, ordered, immediate, reinforcement, of, the, vital, heights, of, alam, halfa, just, behind, his, own, lines, expecting, the, german, commander, erwin, rommel, to, attack, with, the, heights, as, his, objective, something, that, rommel, soon, did, montgomery, ordered, all, contingency, plans, for, retreat, to, be, destroyed, i, have, cancelled, the, plan, for, withdrawal, if, we, are, attacked, then, there, will, be, no, retreat, if, we, cannot, stay, here, alive, then, we, will, stay, here, dead, he, told, his, officers, at, the, first, meeting, he, held, with, them, in, the, desert, though, in, fact, auchinleck, had, no, plans, to, withdraw, from, the, strong, defensive, position, he, had, chosen, and, established, at, el, alamein, montgomery, made, a, great, effort, to, appear, before, troops, as, often, as, possible, frequently, visiting, various, units, and, making, himself, known, to, the, men, often, arranging, for, cigarettes, to, be, distributed, although, he, still, wore, a, standard, british, officer, s, cap, on, arrival, in, the, desert, he, briefly, wore, an, australian, broad, brimmed, hat, before, switching, to, wearing, the, black, beret, with, the, badge, of, the, royal, tank, regiment, and, the, british, general, officer, s, cap, badge, for, which, he, became, notable, the, black, beret, was, offered, to, him, by, jim, fraser, while, the, latter, was, driving, him, on, an, inspection, tour, both, brooke, and, alexander, were, astonished, by, the, transformation, in, atmosphere, when, they, visited, on, 19, august, less, than, a, week, after, montgomery, had, taken, command, alan, brooke, said, that, churchill, was, always, impatient, for, his, generals, to, attack, at, once, and, he, wrote, that, montgomery, was, always, my, monty, when, montgomery, was, out, of, favour, with, churchill, eden, had, some, late, night, drinks, with, churchill, and, eden, said, at, a, meeting, of, the, chiefs, of, staff, the, next, day, 29, october, 1942, that, the, middle, east, offensive, was, petering, out, alanbrooke, had, told, churchill, fairly, plainly, what, he, thought, of, eden, s, ability, to, judge, the, tactical, situation, from, a, distance, and, was, supported, at, the, chiefs, of, staff, meeting, by, smuts, rommel, attempted, to, turn, the, left, flank, of, the, eighth, army, at, the, battle, of, alam, el, halfa, from, 31, august, 1942, the, german, italian, armoured, corps, infantry, attack, was, stopped, in, very, heavy, fighting, rommel, s, forces, had, to, withdraw, urgently, lest, their, retreat, through, the, british, minefields, be, cut, off, montgomery, was, criticised, for, not, counter, attacking, the, retreating, forces, immediately, but, he, felt, strongly, that, his, methodical, build, up, of, british, forces, was, not, yet, ready, a, hasty, counter, attack, risked, ruining, his, strategy, for, an, offensive, on, his, own, terms, in, late, october, planning, for, which, had, begun, soon, after, he, took, command, he, was, confirmed, in, the, permanent, rank, of, lieutenant, general, in, mid, october, the, conquest, of, libya, was, essential, for, airfields, to, support, malta, and, to, threaten, the, rear, of, axis, forces, opposing, operation, torch, montgomery, prepared, meticulously, for, the, new, offensive, after, convincing, churchill, that, the, time, was, not, being, wasted, churchill, sent, a, telegram, to, alexander, on, 23, september, 1942, which, began, we, are, in, your, hands, and, of, course, a, victorious, battle, makes, amends, for, much, delay, he, was, determined, not, to, fight, until, he, thought, there, had, been, sufficient, preparation, for, a, decisive, victory, and, put, into, action, his, beliefs, with, the, gathering, of, resources, detailed, planning, the, training, of, troops, especially, in, clearing, minefields, and, fighting, at, night, and, in, the, use, of, 252, of, the, latest, american, built, sherman, tanks, 90, m7, priest, self, propelled, howitzers, and, making, a, personal, visit, to, every, unit, involved, in, the, offensive, by, the, time, the, offensive, was, ready, in, late, october, eighth, army, had, 231, 000, men, on, its, ration, strength, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, began, on, 23, october, 1942, and, ended, 12, days, later, with, one, of, the, first, large, scale, decisive, allied, land, victories, of, the, war, montgomery, correctly, predicted, both, the, length, of, the, battle, and, the, number, of, casualties, 13, 500, historian, correlli, barnett, has, pointed, out, that, the, rain, also, fell, on, the, germans, and, that, the, weather, is, therefore, an, inadequate, explanation, for, the, failure, to, exploit, the, breakthrough, but, nevertheless, the, battle, of, el, alamein, had, been, a, great, success, over, 30, 000, prisoners, of, war, were, taken, including, the, german, second, in, command, general, von, thoma, as, well, as, eight, other, general, officers, montgomery, was, advanced, to, kcb, and, promoted, to, full, general, he, kept, the, initiative, applying, superior, strength, when, it, suited, him, forcing, rommel, out, of, each, successive, defensive, position, on, 6, march, 1943, rommel, s, attack, on, the, over, extended, eighth, army, at, medenine, operation, capri, with, the, largest, concentration, of, german, armour, in, north, africa, was, successfully, repulsed, at, the, mareth, line, 20, to, 27, march, when, montgomery, encountered, fiercer, frontal, opposition, than, he, had, anticipated, he, switched, his, major, effort, into, an, outflanking, inland, pincer, backed, by, low, flying, raf, fighter, bomber, support, for, his, role, in, north, africa, he, was, awarded, the, legion, of, merit, by, the, united, states, government, in, the, rank, of, chief, commander, the, next, major, allied, attack, was, the, allied, invasion, of, sicily, operation, husky, montgomery, considered, the, initial, plans, for, the, allied, invasion, which, had, been, agreed, in, principle, by, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, the, supreme, allied, commander, allied, forces, headquarters, and, general, alexander, the, 15th, army, group, commander, to, be, unworkable, because, of, the, dispersion, of, effort, he, managed, to, have, the, plans, recast, to, concentrate, the, allied, forces, having, lieutenant, general, george, patton, s, us, seventh, army, land, in, the, gulf, of, gela, on, the, eighth, army, s, left, flank, which, landed, around, syracuse, in, the, south, east, of, sicily, rather, than, near, palermo, in, the, west, and, north, of, sicily, inter, allied, tensions, grew, as, the, american, commanders, patton, and, omar, bradley, then, commanding, us, ii, corps, under, patton, took, umbrage, at, what, they, saw, as, montgomery, s, attitudes, and, boastfulness, however, while, they, were, considered, three, of, the, greatest, soldiers, of, their, time, due, to, their, competitiveness, they, were, renowned, for, squabbling, like, three, schoolgirls, thanks, to, their, bitchiness, whining, to, their, superiors, and, showing, off, montgomery, s, eighth, army, was, then, fully, involved, in, the, allied, invasion, of, italy, in, early, september, 1943, becoming, the, first, of, the, allied, forces, to, land, in, western, europe, led, by, lieutenant, general, sir, miles, dempsey, s, xiii, corps, the, eighth, army, landed, on, the, toe, of, italy, in, operation, baytown, on, 3, september, four, years, to, the, day, after, britain, declared, war, on, germany, they, encountered, little, enemy, resistance, the, germans, had, made, the, decision, to, fall, back, and, did, what, they, could, to, stall, the, eighth, army, s, advance, including, blowing, up, bridges, laying, mines, and, setting, up, booby, traps, all, of, these, slowed, the, army, s, advance, north, on, the, awful, italian, roads, although, it, was, montgomery, who, was, later, much, criticised, for, the, lack, of, progress, on, 9, september, the, british, 1st, airborne, division, landed, at, the, key, port, of, taranto, in, the, heel, of, italy, as, part, of, operation, slapstick, capturing, the, port, unopposed, on, the, same, day, the, u, s, fifth, army, under, lieutenant, general, mark, w, clark, which, actually, contained, a, large, number, of, british, troops, landed, at, salerno, near, naples, as, part, of, operation, avalanche, but, soon, found, itself, fighting, for, its, very, existence, with, the, germans, launching, several, determined, counterattacks, to, try, and, push, the, allies, back, into, the, sea, with, montgomery, s, men, being, too, far, away, to, provide, any, real, assistance, the, situation, was, tense, over, the, next, few, days, but, the, two, armies, both, of, which, formed, the, 15th, army, group, under, general, alexander, finally, began, to, meet, on, 16, september, by, which, time, the, crisis, at, salerno, was, virtually, over, clark, s, fifth, army, then, began, to, advance, to, the, west, of, the, apennine, mountains, while, montgomery, with, lieutenant, general, charles, allfrey, s, v, corps, having, arrived, to, reinforce, dempsey, s, xiii, corps, advanced, to, the, east, the, foggia, airfields, soon, fell, to, allfrey, s, v, corps, but, the, germans, fought, hard, in, the, defence, of, termoli, and, biferno, movement, soon, came, to, an, almost, complete, halt, in, the, early, part, of, november, when, the, eighth, army, came, up, against, a, new, defensive, line, established, by, the, germans, on, the, river, sangro, which, was, to, be, the, scene, of, much, bitter, and, heavy, fighting, for, the, next, month, while, some, ground, was, gained, it, was, often, at, the, expense, of, heavy, casualties, and, the, germans, always, managed, to, retreat, to, new, defensive, positions, montgomery, abhorred, what, he, considered, to, be, a, lack, of, coordination, a, dispersion, of, effort, a, strategic, muddle, and, a, lack, of, opportunism, in, the, allied, campaign, in, italy, describing, the, whole, affair, as, a, dog, s, breakfast, as, a, result, of, his, dissatisfaction, with, italy, he, was, delighted, to, receive, the, news, that, he, was, to, return, to, britain, in, january, 1944, he, was, assigned, to, command, the, 21st, army, group, consisting, of, all, allied, ground, forces, participating, in, operation, overlord, codename, for, the, allied, invasion, of, normandy, overall, direction, was, assigned, to, the, supreme, allied, commander, of, the, allied, expeditionary, forces, american, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, both, churchill, and, eisenhower, had, found, montgomery, difficult, to, work, with, in, the, past, and, wanted, the, position, to, go, to, the, more, affable, general, sir, harold, alexander, however, montgomery, s, patron, general, sir, alan, brooke, firmly, argued, that, montgomery, was, a, much, superior, general, to, alexander, and, ensured, his, appointment, without, brooke, s, support, montgomery, would, have, remained, in, italy, at, st, paul, s, school, on, 7, april, and, 15, may, montgomery, presented, his, strategy, for, the, invasion, he, envisaged, a, ninety, day, battle, with, all, forces, reaching, the, seine, the, campaign, would, pivot, on, an, allied, held, caen, in, the, east, of, the, normandy, bridgehead, with, relatively, static, british, and, canadian, armies, forming, a, shoulder, to, attract, and, defeat, german, counter, attacks, relieving, the, us, armies, who, would, move, and, seize, the, cotentin, peninsula, and, brittany, wheeling, south, and, then, east, on, the, right, forming, a, pincer, during, the, ten, weeks, of, the, battle, of, normandy, unfavourable, autumnal, weather, conditions, disrupted, the, normandy, landing, areas, montgomery, s, initial, plan, was, for, the, anglo, canadian, troops, under, his, command, to, break, out, immediately, from, their, beachheads, on, the, calvados, coast, towards, caen, with, the, aim, of, taking, the, city, on, either, d, day, or, two, days, later, montgomery, attempted, to, take, caen, with, the, 3rd, infantry, division, 50th, northumbrian, infantry, division, and, the, 3rd, canadian, division, but, was, stopped, from, 6, 8, june, by, 21st, panzer, division, and, 12th, ss, panzer, division, hitlerjugend, who, hit, the, advancing, anglo, canadian, troops, very, hard, rommel, followed, up, this, success, by, ordering, the, 2nd, panzer, division, to, caen, while, field, marshal, gerd, von, rundstedt, received, permission, from, hitler, to, have, the, elite, 1st, waffen, ss, division, leibstandarte, adolf, hitler, and, 2nd, waffen, ss, division, das, reich, sent, to, caen, as, well, montgomery, thus, had, to, face, what, stephen, badsey, called, the, most, formidable, of, all, the, german, divisions, in, france, the, 12th, waffen, ss, division, hitlerjugend, as, its, name, implies, was, drawn, entirely, from, the, more, fanatical, elements, of, the, hitler, youth, and, commanded, by, the, ruthless, ss, brigadef, hrer, kurt, meyer, aka, panzer, meyer, the, failure, to, take, caen, immediately, has, been, the, source, of, an, immense, historiographical, dispute, with, bitter, nationalist, overtones, broadly, there, has, been, a, british, school, which, accepts, montgomery, s, post, war, claim, that, he, never, intended, to, take, caen, at, once, and, instead, the, anglo, canadian, operations, around, caen, were, a, holding, operation, intended, to, attract, the, bulk, of, the, german, forces, towards, the, caen, sector, to, allow, the, americans, to, stage, the, break, out, operation, on, the, left, flank, of, the, german, positions, which, was, all, part, of, montgomery, s, master, plan, that, he, had, conceived, long, before, the, normandy, campaign, by, contrast, the, american, school, argued, that, montgomery, s, initial, master, plan, was, for, the, 21st, army, group, to, take, caen, at, once, and, move, his, tank, divisions, into, the, plains, south, of, caen, to, then, stage, a, breakout, that, would, lead, the, 21st, army, group, into, the, plains, of, northern, france, and, hence, into, antwerp, and, finally, the, ruhr, letters, written, by, eisenhower, at, the, time, of, the, battle, make, it, clear, that, eisenhower, was, expecting, from, montgomery, the, early, capture, of, the, important, focal, point, of, caen, later, when, this, plan, had, clearly, failed, eisenhower, wrote, that, montgomery, had, evolved, the, plan, to, have, the, us, forces, achieve, the, break, out, instead, as, the, campaign, progressed, montgomery, altered, his, initial, plan, for, the, invasion, and, continued, the, strategy, of, attracting, and, holding, german, counter, attacks, in, the, area, north, of, caen, rather, than, to, the, south, to, allow, the, u, s, first, army, in, the, west, to, take, cherbourg, a, memo, summarising, montgomery, s, operations, written, by, eisenhower, s, chief, of, staff, general, walter, bedell, smith, who, met, with, montgomery, in, late, june, 1944, says, nothing, about, montgomery, conducting, a, holding, operation, in, the, caen, sector, and, instead, speaks, of, him, seeking, a, breakout, into, the, plains, south, of, the, seine, on, 12, june, montgomery, ordered, the, 7th, armoured, division, into, an, attack, against, the, panzer, lehr, division, that, made, good, progress, at, first, but, ended, when, the, panzer, lehr, was, joined, by, the, 2nd, panzer, division, at, villers, bocage, on, 14, june, the, british, lost, twenty, cromwell, tanks, to, five, tiger, tanks, led, by, ss, obersturmf, hrer, michael, wittmann, in, about, five, minutes, despite, the, setback, at, villers, bocage, montgomery, was, still, optimistic, as, the, allies, were, landing, more, troops, and, supplies, than, they, were, losing, in, battle, and, though, the, german, lines, were, holding, the, wehrmacht, and, waffen, ss, were, suffering, considerable, attrition, air, marshal, sir, arthur, tedder, complained, that, it, was, impossible, to, move, fighter, squadrons, to, france, until, montgomery, had, captured, some, airfields, something, he, asserted, that, montgomery, appeared, incapable, of, doing, the, first, v, 1, flying, bomb, attacks, on, london, which, started, on, 13, june, further, increased, the, pressure, on, montgomery, from, whitehall, to, speed, up, his, advance, on, 18, june, montgomery, ordered, bradley, to, take, cherbourg, while, the, british, were, to, take, caen, by, 23, june, in, operation, epsom, the, british, vii, corps, commanded, by, sir, richard, o, connor, attempted, to, outflank, caen, from, the, west, by, breaking, through, the, dividing, line, between, the, panzer, lehr, and, the, 12th, ss, to, take, the, strategic, hill, 112, epsom, began, well, with, o, connor, s, assault, force, the, british, 15th, scottish, division, breaking, through, and, with, the, 11th, armoured, division, stopping, the, counter, attacks, of, the, 12th, ss, division, general, friedrich, dollmann, of, seventh, army, had, to, commit, the, newly, arrived, ii, ss, corps, to, stop, the, british, offensive, dollmann, fearing, that, epsom, would, be, a, success, committed, suicide, and, was, replaced, by, ss, oberstegruppenf, hrer, paul, hausser, o, connor, at, the, cost, of, about, 4, 000, men, had, won, a, salient, 5, miles, 8, 0, km, deep, and, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, wide, but, placed, the, germans, into, an, unviable, long, term, position, there, was, a, strong, sense, of, crisis, in, the, allied, command, as, the, allies, had, advanced, only, about, 15, miles, 24, km, inland, at, a, time, when, their, plans, called, for, them, to, have, already, taken, rennes, alen, on, and, st, malo, after, epsom, montgomery, had, to, tell, general, harry, crerar, that, the, activation, of, the, first, canadian, army, would, have, to, wait, as, there, was, only, room, at, present, in, the, caen, sector, for, the, newly, arrived, xii, corps, under, lieutenant, general, neil, ritchie, which, caused, some, tension, with, crerar, who, was, anxious, to, get, into, the, field, epsom, had, forced, further, german, forces, into, caen, but, all, through, june, and, the, first, half, of, july, rommel, rundstedt, and, hitler, were, engaged, in, planning, for, a, great, offensive, to, drive, the, british, into, the, sea, it, was, never, launched, and, would, have, required, the, commitment, of, a, large, number, of, german, forces, to, the, caen, sector, it, was, only, after, several, failed, attempts, to, break, out, in, the, caen, sector, that, montgomery, devised, what, he, later, called, his, master, plan, of, having, the, 21st, army, group, hold, the, bulk, of, the, german, forces, thus, allowing, the, americans, to, break, out, the, canadian, historians, terry, copp, and, robert, vogel, wrote, about, the, dispute, between, the, american, school, and, british, school, after, having, suffered, several, setbacks, in, june, 1944, montgomery, drew, what, was, the, indisputably, correct, conclusion, from, these, events, if, the, british, and, canadians, could, continue, to, hold, the, bulk, of, the, german, armoured, divisions, on, their, front, through, a, series, of, limited, attacks, they, could, wear, down, the, germans, and, create, the, conditions, for, an, american, breakout, on, the, right, this, is, what, montgomery, proposed, in, his, directive, of, june, 30th, and, if, he, and, his, admirers, had, let, the, record, speak, for, itself, there, would, be, little, debate, about, his, conduct, of, the, first, stages, of, the, normandy, campaign, instead, montgomery, insisted, that, this, directive, was, a, consistent, part, of, a, master, plan, that, he, had, devised, long, before, the, invasion, curiously, this, view, does, a, great, disservice, to, monty, for, any, rigid, planning, of, operations, before, the, german, response, was, known, would, have, been, bad, generalship, indeed, hampered, by, stormy, weather, and, the, bocage, terrain, montgomery, had, to, ensure, that, rommel, focused, on, the, british, in, the, east, rather, than, the, americans, in, the, west, who, had, to, take, the, cotentin, peninsula, and, brittany, before, the, germans, could, be, trapped, by, a, general, swing, east, montgomery, told, general, sir, miles, dempsey, the, commander, of, second, british, army, go, on, hitting, drawing, the, german, strength, especially, some, of, the, armour, onto, yourself, so, as, to, ease, the, way, for, brad, the, germans, had, deployed, twelve, divisions, of, which, six, were, panzer, divisions, against, the, british, while, deploying, eight, divisions, of, which, three, were, panzer, divisions, against, the, americans, by, the, middle, of, july, caen, had, not, been, taken, as, rommel, continued, to, prioritise, prevention, of, the, break, out, by, british, forces, rather, than, the, western, territories, being, taken, by, the, americans, this, was, broadly, as, montgomery, had, planned, albeit, not, with, the, same, speed, as, he, outlined, at, st, paul, s, although, as, the, american, historian, carlo, d, este, pointed, out, the, actual, situation, in, normandy, was, vastly, different, from, what, was, envisioned, at, the, st, paul, s, conference, as, only, one, of, four, goals, outlined, in, may, had, been, achieved, by, 10, july, on, 7, july, montgomery, began, operation, charnwood, with, a, carpet, bombing, offensive, that, turned, much, of, the, french, countryside, and, the, city, of, caen, into, a, wasteland, the, british, and, canadians, succeeded, in, advancing, into, northern, caen, before, the, germans, who, used, the, ruins, to, their, advantage, and, stopped, the, offensive, on, 10, july, montgomery, ordered, bradley, to, take, avranches, after, which, u, s, third, army, would, be, activated, to, drive, towards, le, mans, and, alen, on, on, 14, july, 1944, montgomery, wrote, to, his, patron, brooke, saying, he, had, chosen, on, a, real, show, down, on, the, eastern, flanks, and, to, loose, a, corps, of, three, armoured, divisions, in, the, open, country, about, the, caen, falaise, road, the, possibilities, are, immense, with, seven, hundred, tanks, loosed, to, the, south, east, of, caen, and, the, armoured, cars, operating, far, ahead, anything, can, happen, the, french, resistance, had, launched, plan, violet, in, june, 1944, to, systematically, destroy, the, telephone, system, of, france, which, forced, the, germans, to, use, their, radios, more, and, more, to, communicate, and, as, the, code, breakers, of, bletchley, park, had, broken, many, of, the, german, codes, montgomery, had, thanks, to, ultra, intelligence, a, good, idea, of, the, german, situation, montgomery, thus, knew, german, army, group, b, had, lost, 96, 400, men, while, receiving, 5, 200, replacements, and, the, panzer, lehr, division, now, based, at, st, l, was, down, to, only, 40, tanks, montgomery, later, wrote, that, he, knew, he, had, the, normandy, campaign, won, at, this, point, as, the, germans, had, almost, no, reserves, while, he, had, three, armoured, divisions, in, reserve, an, american, break, out, was, achieved, with, operation, cobra, and, the, encirclement, of, german, forces, in, the, falaise, pocket, at, the, cost, of, british, losses, with, the, diversionary, operation, goodwood, on, the, early, morning, of, 18, july, 1944, operation, goodwood, began, with, british, heavy, bombers, beginning, carpet, bombing, attacks, that, further, devastated, what, was, left, of, caen, and, the, surrounding, countryside, a, british, tank, crewman, from, the, guards, armoured, division, later, recalled, at, 0500, hours, a, distant, thunder, in, the, air, brought, all, the, sleepy, eyed, tank, crews, out, of, their, blankets, 1, 000, lancasters, were, flying, from, the, sea, in, groups, of, three, or, four, at, 3, 000, feet, 910, m, ahead, of, them, the, pathfinders, were, scattering, their, flares, and, before, long, the, first, bombs, were, dropping, a, german, tankman, from, the, 21st, panzer, division, at, the, receiving, end, of, this, bombardment, remembered, we, saw, little, dots, detach, themselves, from, the, planes, so, many, of, them, that, the, crazy, thought, occurred, to, us, are, those, leaflets, among, the, thunder, of, the, explosions, we, could, hear, the, wounded, scream, and, the, insane, howling, of, men, who, had, driven, mad, the, british, bombing, had, badly, smashed, the, german, front, line, units, initially, the, three, british, armoured, divisions, assigned, to, lead, the, offensive, the, 7th, 11th, and, the, guards, made, rapid, progress, and, were, soon, approaching, the, borguebus, ridge, which, dominated, the, landscape, south, of, caen, by, noon, if, the, british, could, take, the, borguebus, ridge, the, way, to, the, plains, of, northern, france, would, be, wide, open, and, potentially, paris, could, be, taken, which, explains, the, ferocity, with, which, the, germans, defended, the, ridge, one, german, officer, lieutenant, baron, von, rosen, recalled, that, to, motivate, a, luftwaffe, officer, commanding, a, battery, of, four, 88, mm, guns, to, fight, against, the, british, tanks, he, had, to, hold, his, handgun, to, the, officer, s, head, and, asked, him, whether, he, would, like, to, be, killed, immediately, or, get, a, high, decoration, he, decided, for, the, latter, the, well, dug, in, 88, mm, guns, around, the, borguebus, ridge, began, taking, a, toll, on, the, british, sherman, tanks, and, the, countryside, was, soon, dotted, with, dozens, of, burning, shermans, one, british, officer, reported, with, worry, i, see, palls, of, smoke, and, tanks, brewing, up, with, flames, belching, forth, from, their, turrets, i, see, men, climbing, out, on, fire, like, torches, rolling, on, the, ground, to, try, and, douse, the, flames, despite, montgomery, s, orders, to, try, to, press, on, fierce, german, counter, attacks, stopped, the, british, offensive, the, objectives, of, operation, goodwood, were, all, achieved, except, the, complete, capture, of, the, bourgebus, ridge, which, was, only, partially, taken, the, operation, was, a, strategic, allied, success, in, drawing, in, the, last, german, reserves, in, normandy, towards, the, caen, sector, away, from, the, american, sector, greatly, assisting, the, american, breakout, in, operation, cobra, by, the, end, of, goodwood, on, 25, july, 1944, the, canadians, had, finally, taken, caen, while, the, british, tanks, had, reached, the, plains, south, of, caen, giving, montgomery, the, hinge, he, had, been, seeking, while, forcing, the, germans, to, commit, the, last, of, their, reserves, to, stop, the, anglo, canadian, offensive, ultra, decrypts, indicated, that, the, germans, now, facing, bradley, were, seriously, understrength, with, operation, cobra, about, to, commence, during, operation, goodwood, the, british, had, 400, tanks, knocked, out, with, many, recovered, returning, to, service, the, casualties, were, 5, 500, with, 7, miles, 11, km, of, ground, gained, bradley, recognised, montgomery, s, plan, to, pin, down, german, armour, and, allow, u, s, forces, to, break, out, the, british, and, canadian, armies, were, to, decoy, the, enemy, reserves, and, draw, them, to, their, front, on, the, extreme, eastern, edge, of, the, allied, beachhead, thus, while, monty, taunted, the, enemy, at, caen, we, were, to, make, our, break, on, the, long, roundabout, road, to, paris, when, reckoned, in, terms, of, national, pride, this, british, decoy, mission, became, a, sacrificial, one, for, while, we, tramped, around, the, outside, flank, the, british, were, to, sit, in, place, and, pin, down, the, germans, yet, strategically, it, fitted, into, a, logical, division, of, labors, for, it, was, towards, caen, that, the, enemy, reserves, would, race, once, the, alarm, was, sounded, the, long, running, dispute, over, what, montgomery, s, master, plan, in, normandy, led, historians, to, differ, greatly, about, the, purpose, of, goodwood, the, british, journalist, mark, urban, wrote, that, the, purpose, of, goodwood, was, to, draw, german, troops, to, their, left, flank, to, allow, the, american, forces, to, break, out, on, the, right, flank, arguing, that, montgomery, had, to, lie, to, his, soldiers, about, the, purpose, of, goodwood, as, the, average, british, soldier, would, not, have, understood, why, they, were, being, asked, to, create, a, diversion, to, allow, the, americans, to, have, the, glory, of, staging, the, breakout, with, operation, cobra, by, contrast, the, american, historian, stephen, power, argued, that, goodwood, was, intended, to, be, the, breakout, offensive, and, not, a, holding, operation, writing, it, is, unrealistic, to, assert, that, an, operation, which, called, for, the, use, of, 4, 500, allied, aircraft, 700, artillery, pieces, and, over, 8, 000, armored, vehicles, and, trucks, and, that, cost, the, british, over, 5, 500, casualties, was, conceived, and, executed, for, so, limited, an, objective, power, noted, that, goodwood, and, cobra, were, supposed, to, take, effect, on, the, same, day, 18, july, 1944, but, cobra, was, cancelled, owing, to, heavy, rain, in, the, american, sector, and, argued, that, both, operations, were, meant, to, be, breakout, operations, to, trap, the, german, armies, in, normandy, american, military, writer, drew, middleton, wrote, that, there, is, no, doubt, that, montgomery, wanted, goodwood, to, provide, a, shield, for, bradley, but, at, the, same, time, montgomery, was, clearly, hoping, for, more, than, merely, diverting, german, attention, away, from, the, american, sector, british, historian, john, keegan, pointed, out, that, montgomery, made, differing, statements, before, goodwood, about, the, purpose, of, the, operation, keegan, wrote, that, montgomery, engaged, in, what, he, called, a, hedging, of, his, bets, when, drafting, his, plans, for, goodwood, with, a, plan, for, a, break, out, if, the, front, collapsed, if, not, sound, documentary, evidence, that, all, he, had, intended, in, the, first, place, was, a, battle, of, attrition, again, bradley, confirmed, montgomery, s, plan, and, that, the, capture, of, caen, was, only, incidental, to, his, mission, not, critical, the, american, magazine, life, quoted, bradley, in, 1951, while, collins, was, hoisting, his, vii, corps, flag, over, cherbourg, montgomery, was, spending, his, reputation, in, a, bitter, siege, against, the, old, university, city, of, caen, for, three, weeks, he, had, rammed, his, troops, against, those, panzer, divisions, he, had, deliberately, drawn, towards, that, city, as, part, of, our, allied, strategy, of, diversion, in, the, normandy, campaign, although, caen, contained, an, important, road, junction, that, montgomery, would, eventually, need, for, the, moment, the, capture, of, that, city, was, only, incidental, to, his, mission, for, monty, s, primary, task, was, to, attract, german, troops, to, the, british, front, that, we, might, more, easily, secure, cherbourg, and, get, into, position, for, the, breakout, while, this, diversion, of, monty, s, was, brilliantly, achieved, he, nevertheless, left, himself, open, to, criticism, by, overemphasising, the, importance, of, his, thrust, toward, caen, had, he, limited, himself, simply, to, the, containment, without, making, caen, a, symbol, of, it, he, would, have, been, credited, with, success, instead, of, being, charged, as, he, was, with, failure, with, goodwood, drawing, the, wehrmacht, towards, the, british, sector, u, s, first, army, enjoyed, a, two, to, one, numerical, superiority, bradley, accepted, montgomery, s, advice, to, begin, the, offensive, by, concentrating, at, one, point, instead, of, a, broad, front, as, eisenhower, would, have, preferred, operation, goodwood, almost, cost, montgomery, his, job, as, eisenhower, seriously, considered, sacking, him, and, only, chose, not, to, do, so, because, to, sack, the, popular, monty, would, have, caused, such, a, political, backlash, in, britain, against, the, americans, at, a, critical, moment, in, the, war, that, the, resulting, strains, in, the, atlantic, alliance, were, not, considered, worth, it, montgomery, expressed, his, satisfaction, at, the, results, of, goodwood, when, calling, the, operation, off, eisenhower, was, under, the, impression, that, goodwood, was, to, be, a, break, out, operation, either, there, was, a, miscommunication, between, the, two, men, or, eisenhower, did, not, understand, the, strategy, bradley, fully, understood, montgomery, s, intentions, both, men, would, not, give, away, to, the, press, the, true, intentions, of, their, strategy, many, american, officers, had, found, montgomery, a, difficult, man, to, work, with, and, after, goodwood, pressured, eisenhower, to, fire, montgomery, although, the, eisenhower, montgomery, dispute, is, sometimes, depicted, in, nationalist, terms, as, being, an, anglo, american, struggle, it, was, the, british, air, marshal, arthur, tedder, who, was, pressing, eisenhower, most, strongly, after, goodwood, to, fire, montgomery, an, american, officer, wrote, in, his, diary, that, tedder, had, come, to, see, eisenhower, to, pursue, his, current, favourite, subject, the, sacking, of, monty, with, tedder, leading, the, sack, monty, campaign, it, encouraged, montgomery, s, american, enemies, to, press, eisenhower, to, fire, montgomery, brooke, was, sufficiently, worried, about, the, sack, monty, campaign, to, visit, montgomery, at, his, tactical, headquarters, tac, in, france, and, as, he, wrote, in, his, diary, warned, of, a, tendency, in, the, pm, to, listen, to, suggestions, that, monty, played, for, safety, and, was, not, prepared, to, take, risks, brooke, advised, montgomery, to, invite, churchill, to, normandy, arguing, that, if, the, sack, monty, campaign, had, won, the, prime, minister, over, then, his, career, would, be, over, as, having, churchill, s, backing, would, give, eisenhower, the, political, cover, to, fire, montgomery, on, 20, july, montgomery, met, eisenhower, and, on, 21, july, churchill, at, the, tac, in, france, one, of, montgomery, s, staff, officers, wrote, afterwards, that, it, was, common, knowledge, at, tac, that, churchill, had, come, to, sack, monty, no, notes, were, taken, at, the, eisenhower, montgomery, and, churchill, montgomery, meetings, but, montgomery, was, able, to, persuade, both, men, not, to, sack, him, with, the, success, of, cobra, which, was, soon, followed, by, unleashing, patton, s, third, army, eisenhower, wrote, to, montgomery, am, delighted, that, your, basic, plan, has, begun, brilliantly, to, unfold, with, bradley, s, initial, success, the, success, of, cobra, was, aided, by, operation, spring, when, the, ii, canadian, corps, under, general, guy, simonds, the, only, canadian, general, whose, skill, montgomery, respected, began, an, offensive, south, of, caen, that, made, little, headway, but, which, the, germans, regarded, as, the, main, offensive, once, third, army, arrived, bradley, was, promoted, to, take, command, of, the, newly, created, 12th, army, group, consisting, of, u, s, first, and, third, armies, following, the, american, breakout, there, followed, the, battle, of, falaise, gap, british, canadian, and, polish, soldiers, of, 21st, army, group, commanded, by, montgomery, advanced, south, while, the, american, and, french, soldiers, of, bradley, s, 12th, army, group, advanced, north, to, encircle, the, german, army, group, b, at, falaise, as, montgomery, waged, what, urban, called, a, huge, battle, of, annihilation, in, august, 1944, montgomery, began, his, offensive, into, the, suisse, normande, region, with, operation, bluecoat, with, sir, richard, o, connor, s, viii, corps, and, gerard, bucknall, s, xxx, corps, heading, south, a, dissatisfied, montgomery, sacked, bucknall, for, being, insufficiently, aggressive, and, replaced, him, with, general, brian, horrocks, at, the, same, time, montgomery, ordered, patton, whose, third, army, was, supposed, to, advance, into, brittany, to, instead, capture, nantes, which, was, soon, taken, hitler, waited, too, long, to, order, his, soldiers, to, retreat, from, normandy, leading, montgomery, to, write, he, refused, to, face, the, only, sound, military, course, as, a, result, the, allies, caused, the, enemy, staggering, losses, in, men, and, materials, knowing, via, ultra, that, hitler, was, not, planning, to, retreat, from, normandy, montgomery, on, 6, august, 1944, ordered, an, envelopment, operation, against, army, group, b, with, the, first, canadian, army, under, harry, crerar, to, advance, towards, falaise, british, second, army, under, miles, dempsey, to, advance, towards, argentan, and, patton, s, third, army, to, advance, to, alen, on, on, 11, august, montgomery, changed, his, plan, with, the, canadians, to, take, falaise, and, to, meet, the, americans, at, argentan, the, first, canadian, army, launched, two, operations, operation, totalize, on, 7, august, which, advanced, only, 9, miles, 14, km, in, four, days, in, the, face, of, fierce, german, resistance, and, operation, tractable, on, 14, august, which, finally, took, falaise, on, 17, august, in, view, of, the, slow, canadian, advance, patton, requested, permission, to, take, falaise, but, was, refused, by, bradley, on, 13, august, this, prompted, much, controversy, many, historians, arguing, that, bradley, lacked, aggression, and, that, montgomery, should, have, overruled, bradley, the, so, called, falaise, gap, was, closed, on, 22, august, 1944, but, several, american, generals, most, notably, patton, accused, montgomery, of, being, insufficiently, aggressive, in, closing, it, about, 60, 000, german, soldiers, were, trapped, in, normandy, but, before, 22, august, about, 20, 000, germans, had, escaped, through, the, falaise, gap, about, 10, 000, germans, had, been, killed, in, the, battle, of, the, falaise, gap, which, led, a, stunned, eisenhower, who, viewed, the, battlefield, on, 24, august, to, comment, with, horror, that, it, was, impossible, to, walk, without, stepping, on, corpses, the, successful, conclusion, of, the, normandy, campaign, saw, the, beginning, of, the, debate, between, the, american, school, and, british, school, as, both, american, and, british, generals, started, to, advance, claims, about, who, was, most, responsible, for, this, victory, brooke, wrote, in, defence, of, his, prot, g, montgomery, ike, knows, nothing, about, strategy, and, is, quite, unsuited, to, the, post, of, supreme, commander, it, is, no, wonder, that, monty, s, real, high, ability, is, not, always, realised, especially, so, when, national, spectacles, pervert, the, perspective, of, the, strategic, landscape, about, montgomery, s, conduct, of, the, normandy, campaign, badsey, wrote, too, much, discussion, on, normandy, has, centered, on, the, controversial, decisions, of, the, allied, commanders, it, was, not, good, enough, apparently, to, win, such, a, complete, and, spectacular, victory, over, an, enemy, that, had, conquered, most, of, europe, unless, it, was, done, perfectly, most, of, the, blame, for, this, lies, with, montgomery, who, was, foolish, enough, to, insist, that, it, had, been, done, perfectly, that, normandy, and, all, his, other, battles, had, been, fought, accordingly, to, a, precise, master, plan, drawn, up, beforehand, from, which, he, never, deviated, it, says, much, for, his, personality, that, montgomery, found, others, to, agree, with, him, despite, overwhelming, evidence, to, the, contrary, his, handling, of, the, battle, of, normandy, was, of, a, very, high, order, and, as, the, person, who, would, certainly, have, been, blamed, for, losing, the, battle, he, deserves, the, credit, for, winning, it, eisenhower, took, over, ground, forces, command, on, 1, september, while, continuing, as, supreme, commander, with, montgomery, continuing, to, command, the, 21st, army, group, now, consisting, mainly, of, british, and, canadian, units, montgomery, bitterly, resented, this, change, although, it, had, been, agreed, before, the, d, day, invasion, the, british, journalist, mark, urban, writes, that, montgomery, seemed, unable, to, grasp, that, as, the, majority, of, the, 2, 2, million, allied, soldiers, fighting, against, germany, on, the, western, front, were, now, american, the, ratio, was, 3, 1, that, it, was, politically, unacceptable, to, american, public, opinion, to, have, montgomery, remain, as, land, forces, commander, as, politics, would, not, allow, him, to, carry, on, giving, orders, to, great, armies, of, americans, simply, because, in, his, view, he, was, better, than, their, generals, winston, churchill, had, montgomery, promoted, to, field, marshal, by, way, of, compensation, by, september, ports, like, cherbourg, were, too, far, away, from, the, front, line, causing, the, allies, great, logistical, problems, antwerp, was, the, third, largest, port, in, europe, it, was, a, deep, water, inland, port, connected, to, the, north, sea, via, the, river, scheldt, the, scheldt, was, wide, enough, and, dredged, deep, enough, to, allow, the, passage, of, ocean, going, ships, on, 3, september, 1944, hitler, ordered, fifteenth, army, which, had, been, stationed, in, the, pas, de, calais, region, and, was, withdrawing, north, into, the, low, countries, to, hold, the, mouth, of, the, river, scheldt, to, deprive, the, allies, of, the, use, of, antwerp, von, rundstedt, the, german, commander, of, the, western, front, ordered, general, gustav, adolf, von, zangen, the, commander, of, 15th, army, that, the, attempt, of, the, enemy, to, occupy, the, west, scheldt, in, order, to, obtain, the, free, use, of, the, harbor, of, antwerp, must, be, resisted, to, the, utmost, emphasis, in, the, original, rundstedt, argued, with, hitler, that, as, long, as, the, allies, could, not, use, the, port, of, antwerp, the, allies, would, lack, the, logistical, capacity, for, an, invasion, of, germany, the, witte, brigade, white, brigade, of, the, belgian, resistance, had, captured, the, port, of, antwerp, before, the, germans, could, destroy, key, port, facilities, and, on, 4, september, antwerp, was, captured, by, horrocks, with, its, harbour, mostly, intact, the, british, declined, to, immediately, advance, over, the, albert, canal, and, an, opportunity, to, destroy, the, german, fifteenth, army, was, lost, the, germans, had, mined, the, river, scheldt, the, mouth, of, the, scheldt, was, still, in, german, hands, making, it, impossible, for, the, royal, navy, to, clear, the, mines, in, the, river, and, therefore, the, port, of, antwerp, was, still, useless, to, the, allies, on, 5, september, shaef, s, naval, commander, admiral, sir, bertram, ramsay, had, urged, montgomery, to, make, clearing, the, mouth, of, the, scheldt, his, number, one, priority, alone, among, the, senior, commanders, only, ramsay, saw, opening, antwerp, as, crucial, thanks, to, ultra, montgomery, was, aware, of, hitler, s, order, by, 5, september, on, 9, september, montgomery, wrote, to, brooke, that, one, good, pas, de, calais, port, would, be, sufficient, to, meet, all, the, logistical, needs, of, the, 21st, army, group, but, only, the, supply, needs, of, the, same, formation, at, the, same, time, montgomery, noted, that, one, good, pas, de, calais, port, would, be, insufficient, for, the, american, armies, in, france, which, would, thus, force, eisenhower, if, for, no, other, reasons, than, logistics, to, favour, montgomery, s, plans, for, an, invasion, of, northern, germany, by, the, 21st, army, group, whereas, if, antwerp, were, opened, up, then, all, of, the, allied, armies, could, be, supplied, the, importance, of, ports, closer, to, germany, was, highlighted, with, the, liberation, of, the, city, of, le, havre, which, was, assigned, to, john, crocker, s, i, corps, to, take, le, havre, two, infantry, divisions, two, tank, brigades, most, of, the, artillery, of, the, second, british, army, the, specialised, armoured, gadgets, of, percy, hobart, s, 79th, armoured, division, the, battleship, hms, warspite, and, the, monitor, hms, erebus, were, all, committed, on, 10, september, 1944, bomber, command, dropped, 4, 719, tons, of, bombs, on, le, havre, which, was, the, prelude, to, operation, astonia, the, assault, on, le, havre, by, crocker, s, men, which, was, taken, two, days, later, the, canadian, historian, terry, copp, wrote, that, the, commitment, of, this, much, firepower, and, men, to, take, only, one, french, city, might, seem, excessive, but, by, this, point, the, allies, desperately, needed, ports, closer, to, the, front, line, to, sustain, their, advance, in, september, 1944, montgomery, ordered, crerar, and, his, first, canadian, army, to, take, the, french, ports, on, the, english, channel, namely, calais, boulogne, and, dunkirk, and, to, clear, the, scheldt, a, task, that, crerar, stated, was, impossible, as, he, lacked, enough, troops, to, perform, both, operations, at, once, montgomery, refused, crerar, s, request, to, have, british, xii, corps, under, neil, ritchie, assigned, to, help, clear, the, scheldt, as, montgomery, stated, he, needed, xii, corps, for, operation, market, garden, on, 6, september, 1944, montgomery, told, crerar, that, i, want, boulogne, badly, and, that, city, should, be, taken, no, matter, what, the, cost, on, 22, september, 1944, simonds, s, ii, canadian, corps, took, boulogne, followed, up, by, taking, calais, on, 1, october, 1944, montgomery, was, highly, impatient, with, simonds, complaining, that, it, had, taken, crocker, s, i, corps, only, two, days, to, take, le, havre, while, it, took, simonds, two, weeks, to, take, boulogne, and, calais, but, simonds, noted, that, at, le, havre, three, divisions, and, two, brigades, had, been, employed, whereas, at, both, boulogne, and, calais, only, two, brigades, were, sent, in, to, take, both, cities, after, an, attempt, to, storm, the, leopold, canal, by, the, 4th, canadian, division, had, been, badly, smashed, by, the, german, defenders, simonds, ordered, a, stop, to, further, attempts, to, clear, the, river, scheldt, until, his, mission, of, capturing, the, french, ports, on, the, english, channel, had, been, accomplished, this, allowed, the, german, fifteenth, army, ample, time, to, dig, into, its, new, home, on, the, scheldt, the, only, port, that, was, not, captured, by, the, canadians, was, dunkirk, as, montgomery, ordered, the, 2nd, canadian, division, on, 15, september, to, hold, his, flank, at, antwerp, as, a, prelude, for, an, advance, up, the, scheldt, montgomery, pulled, away, from, the, first, canadian, army, temporarily, commanded, now, by, simonds, as, crerar, was, ill, the, british, 51st, highland, division, 1st, polish, division, british, 49th, west, riding, division, and, 2nd, canadian, armoured, brigade, and, sent, all, of, these, formations, to, help, the, second, british, army, to, expand, the, market, garden, salient, with, operations, constellation, aintree, and, towards, the, end, of, october, pheasant, however, simonds, seems, to, have, regarded, the, scheldt, campaign, as, a, test, of, his, ability, and, he, felt, he, could, clear, the, scheldt, with, only, three, canadian, divisions, despite, having, to, take, on, the, entire, fifteenth, army, which, held, strongly, fortified, positions, in, a, landscape, that, favoured, the, defence, simonds, never, complained, about, the, lack, of, air, support, made, worse, by, the, cloudy, october, weather, shortages, of, ammunition, or, having, insufficient, troops, regarding, these, problems, as, challenges, for, him, to, overcome, rather, than, a, cause, for, complaint, as, it, was, simonds, made, only, slow, progress, in, october, 1944, during, the, fighting, in, the, battle, of, the, scheldt, although, he, was, praised, by, copp, for, imaginative, and, aggressive, leadership, who, managed, to, achieve, much, despite, all, of, the, odds, against, him, montgomery, had, little, respect, for, the, canadian, generals, whom, he, dismissed, as, mediocre, with, the, exception, of, simonds, whom, he, consistently, praised, as, canada, s, only, first, rate, general, in, the, entire, war, admiral, ramsay, who, proved, to, be, a, far, more, articulate, and, forceful, champion, of, the, canadians, than, their, own, generals, starting, on, 9, october, demanded, of, eisenhower, in, a, meeting, that, he, either, order, montgomery, to, make, supporting, the, first, canadian, army, in, the, scheldt, fighting, his, number, one, priority, or, sack, him, ramsay, in, very, strong, language, argued, to, eisenhower, that, the, allies, could, only, invade, germany, if, antwerp, was, opened, and, that, as, long, as, the, three, canadian, divisions, fighting, in, the, scheldt, had, shortages, of, ammunition, and, artillery, shells, because, montgomery, made, the, arnhem, salient, his, first, priority, then, antwerp, would, not, be, opened, anytime, soon, even, brooke, wrote, in, his, diary, i, feel, that, monty, s, strategy, for, once, is, at, fault, instead, of, carrying, out, the, advance, to, arnhem, he, ought, to, have, made, certain, of, antwerp, on, 9, october, 1944, at, ramsay, s, urging, eisenhower, sent, montgomery, a, cable, that, emphasised, the, supreme, importance, of, antwerp, that, the, canadian, army, will, not, repeat, not, be, able, to, attack, until, november, unless, immediately, supplied, with, adequate, ammunition, and, warned, that, the, allied, advance, into, germany, would, totally, stop, by, mid, november, unless, antwerp, was, opened, by, october, montgomery, replied, by, accusing, ramsay, of, making, wild, statements, unsupported, by, the, facts, denying, the, canadians, were, having, to, ration, ammunition, and, claimed, that, he, would, soon, take, the, ruhr, thereby, making, the, scheldt, campaign, a, sideshow, montgomery, further, issued, a, memo, entitled, notes, on, command, in, western, europe, demanding, that, he, once, again, be, made, land, forces, commander, this, led, to, an, exasperated, eisenhower, telling, montgomery, that, the, question, was, not, the, command, arrangement, but, rather, his, montgomery, s, ability, and, willingness, to, obey, orders, eisenhower, further, told, montgomery, to, either, obey, orders, to, immediately, clear, the, mouth, of, the, scheldt, or, be, sacked, a, chastised, montgomery, told, eisenhower, on, 15, october, 1944, that, he, was, now, making, clearing, the, scheldt, his, top, priority, and, the, ammunition, shortages, in, the, first, canadian, army, a, problem, which, he, denied, even, existed, five, days, earlier, were, now, over, as, supplying, the, canadians, was, henceforth, his, first, concern, simonds, now, reinforced, with, british, troops, and, royal, marines, cleared, the, scheldt, by, taking, walcheren, island, the, last, of, the, german, fortresses, on, the, scheldt, on, 8, november, 1944, with, the, scheldt, in, allied, hands, royal, navy, minesweepers, removed, the, german, mines, in, the, river, and, antwerp, was, finally, opened, to, shipping, on, 28, november, 1944, reflecting, antwerp, s, importance, the, germans, spent, the, winter, of, 1944, 45, firing, v, 1, flying, bombs, and, v, 2, rockets, at, it, in, an, attempt, to, shut, down, the, port, and, the, german, offensive, in, december, 1944, in, the, ardennes, had, as, its, ultimate, objective, the, capture, of, antwerp, urban, wrote, that, montgomery, s, most, serious, failure, in, the, entire, war, was, not, the, well, publicised, battle, of, arnhem, but, rather, his, lack, of, interest, in, opening, up, antwerp, as, without, it, the, entire, allied, advance, from, the, north, sea, to, the, swiss, alps, stalled, in, the, autumn, of, 1944, for, logistical, reasons, montgomery, was, able, to, persuade, eisenhower, to, allow, him, to, test, his, strategy, of, a, single, thrust, to, the, ruhr, with, operation, market, garden, in, september, 1944, the, offensive, was, strategically, bold, following, the, allied, breakout, from, normandy, eisenhower, favored, pursuing, the, german, armies, northwards, and, eastwards, to, the, rhine, on, a, broad, front, eisenhower, relied, on, speed, which, in, turn, depended, on, logistics, which, were, stretched, to, the, limit, supreme, headquarters, allied, expeditionary, force, shaef, did, provide, montgomery, with, additional, resources, principally, additional, locomotives, and, rolling, stock, and, priority, for, air, supply, eisenhower, s, decision, to, launch, market, garden, was, influenced, by, his, desire, to, keep, the, retreating, germans, under, pressure, and, by, the, pressure, from, the, united, states, to, use, the, first, allied, airborne, army, as, soon, as, possible, montgomery, s, plan, for, operation, market, garden, 17, 25, september, 1944, was, to, outflank, the, siegfried, line, and, cross, the, rhine, setting, the, stage, for, later, offensives, into, the, ruhr, region, the, 21st, army, group, would, attack, north, from, belgium, 60, miles, 97, km, through, the, netherlands, across, the, rhine, and, consolidate, north, of, arnhem, on, the, far, side, of, the, rhine, the, risky, plan, required, three, airborne, divisions, to, capture, numerous, intact, bridges, along, a, single, lane, road, on, which, an, entire, corps, had, to, attack, and, use, as, its, main, supply, route, the, offensive, failed, to, achieve, its, objectives, both, churchill, and, montgomery, claimed, that, the, operation, was, nearly, or, 90, successful, although, in, montgomery, s, equivocal, acceptance, of, responsibility, he, blames, lack, of, support, and, also, refers, to, the, battle, of, the, scheldt, which, was, undertaken, by, canadian, troops, not, involved, in, market, garden, montgomery, later, said, it, was, a, bad, mistake, on, my, part, i, underestimated, the, difficulties, of, opening, up, the, approaches, to, antwerp, i, reckoned, the, canadian, army, could, do, it, while, we, were, going, for, the, ruhr, i, was, wrong, in, my, prejudiced, view, if, the, operation, had, been, properly, backed, from, its, inception, and, given, the, aircraft, ground, forces, and, administrative, resources, necessary, for, the, job, it, would, have, succeeded, in, spite, of, my, mistakes, or, the, adverse, weather, or, the, presence, of, the, 2nd, ss, panzer, corps, in, the, arnhem, area, i, remain, market, garden, s, unrepentant, advocate, in, the, aftermath, of, market, garden, montgomery, made, holding, the, arnhem, salient, his, first, priority, arguing, that, the, second, british, army, might, still, be, able, to, break, through, and, reach, the, wide, open, plains, of, northern, germany, and, that, he, might, be, able, to, take, the, ruhr, by, the, end, of, october, the, germans, under, field, marshal, walther, model, in, early, october, attempted, to, retake, the, nijmegen, salient, but, were, beaten, back, in, the, meantime, the, first, canadian, army, finally, achieved, the, task, of, clearing, the, mouth, of, the, river, scheldt, despite, the, fact, that, in, the, words, of, copp, and, vogel, that, montgomery, s, directive, required, the, canadians, to, continue, to, fight, alone, for, almost, two, weeks, in, a, battle, which, everyone, agreed, could, only, be, won, with, the, aid, of, additional, divisions, on, 16, december, 1944, at, the, start, of, the, battle, of, the, bulge, montgomery, s, 21st, army, group, was, on, the, northern, flank, of, the, allied, lines, bradley, s, us, 12th, army, group, was, to, montgomery, s, south, with, william, simpson, s, u, s, ninth, army, adjacent, to, 21st, army, group, courtney, hodges, u, s, first, army, holding, the, ardennes, and, patton, s, u, s, third, army, further, south, shaef, believed, the, wehrmacht, was, no, longer, capable, of, launching, a, major, offensive, and, that, no, offensive, could, be, launched, through, such, rugged, terrain, as, the, ardennes, forest, because, of, this, the, area, was, held, by, refitting, and, newly, arrived, american, formations, the, wehrmacht, planned, to, exploit, this, by, making, a, surprise, attack, through, the, ardennes, forest, whilst, bad, weather, grounded, allied, air, power, splitting, the, allied, armies, in, two, they, would, then, turn, north, to, recapture, the, port, of, antwerp, if, the, attack, were, to, succeed, in, capturing, antwerp, the, whole, of, 21st, army, group, along, with, u, s, ninth, army, and, most, of, u, s, first, army, would, be, trapped, without, supplies, behind, german, lines, the, attack, initially, advanced, rapidly, splitting, u, s, 12th, army, group, in, two, with, all, of, u, s, ninth, army, and, the, bulk, of, u, s, first, army, on, the, northern, shoulder, of, the, german, bulge, the, 12th, army, group, commander, bradley, was, located, in, luxembourg, making, command, of, the, u, s, forces, north, of, the, bulge, problematic, as, montgomery, was, the, nearest, army, group, commander, on, the, ground, on, 20, december, eisenhower, temporarily, transferred, command, of, u, s, ninth, army, and, u, s, first, army, to, montgomery, s, 21st, army, group, bradley, was, concerned, because, it, might, discredit, the, american, command, but, that, it, might, mean, montgomery, would, commit, more, of, his, reserves, to, the, battle, in, practice, the, change, led, to, great, resentment, on, the, part, of, many, americans, particularly, at, headquarters, 12th, army, group, and, third, army, with, the, british, and, american, forces, under, montgomery, s, command, holding, the, northern, flank, of, the, german, assault, general, patton, s, third, army, which, was, 90, miles, 140, km, to, the, south, turned, north, and, fought, its, way, through, the, severe, weather, and, german, opposition, to, relieve, the, besieged, american, forces, in, bastogne, four, days, after, montgomery, took, command, of, the, northern, flank, the, bad, weather, cleared, and, the, usaaf, and, raf, resumed, operations, inflicting, heavy, casualties, on, german, troops, and, vehicles, six, days, after, montgomery, took, command, of, the, northern, flank, patton, s, third, army, relieved, the, besieged, american, forces, in, bastogne, unable, to, advance, further, and, running, out, of, fuel, the, wehrmacht, abandoned, the, offensive, morelock, states, that, montgomery, was, preoccupied, with, leading, a, single, thrust, offensive, to, berlin, as, the, overall, commander, of, allied, ground, forces, and, that, he, accordingly, treated, the, ardennes, counteroffensive, as, a, sideshow, to, be, finished, with, the, least, possible, effort, and, expenditure, of, resources, montgomery, subsequently, wrote, of, his, actions, the, first, thing, to, do, was, to, see, the, battle, on, the, northern, flank, as, one, whole, to, ensure, the, vital, areas, were, held, securely, and, to, create, reserves, for, counter, attack, i, embarked, on, these, measures, i, put, british, troops, under, command, of, the, ninth, army, to, fight, alongside, american, soldiers, and, made, that, army, take, over, some, of, the, first, army, front, i, positioned, british, troops, as, reserves, behind, the, first, and, ninth, armies, until, such, time, as, american, reserves, could, be, created, after, the, war, hasso, von, manteuffel, who, commanded, the, 5th, panzer, army, in, the, ardennes, was, imprisoned, awaiting, trial, for, war, crimes, during, this, period, he, was, interviewed, by, b, h, liddell, hart, a, british, author, who, has, since, been, accused, of, putting, words, in, the, mouths, of, german, generals, and, attempting, to, rewrite, the, historical, record, after, conducting, several, interviews, via, an, interpreter, liddell, hart, in, a, subsequent, book, attributed, to, manteuffel, the, following, statement, about, montgomery, s, contribution, to, the, battle, in, the, ardennes, the, operations, of, the, american, 1st, army, had, developed, into, a, series, of, individual, holding, actions, montgomery, s, contribution, to, restoring, the, situation, was, that, he, turned, a, series, of, isolated, actions, into, a, coherent, battle, fought, according, to, a, clear, and, definite, plan, it, was, his, refusal, to, engage, in, premature, and, piecemeal, counter, attacks, which, enabled, the, americans, to, gather, their, reserves, and, frustrate, the, german, attempts, to, extend, their, breakthrough, however, american, historian, stephen, ambrose, writing, in, 1997, maintained, that, putting, monty, in, command, of, the, northern, flank, had, no, effect, on, the, battle, ambrose, wrote, that, far, from, directing, the, victory, montgomery, had, gotten, in, everyone, s, way, and, had, botched, the, counter, attack, general, omar, bradley, blamed, montgomery, s, stagnating, conservatism, for, his, failure, to, counter, attack, when, ordered, to, do, so, by, eisenhower, command, of, u, s, first, army, reverted, to, 12th, army, group, on, 17, january, 1945, whilst, command, of, u, s, ninth, army, remained, with, 21st, army, group, for, the, coming, operations, to, cross, the, rhine, in, february, 1945, montgomery, s, 21st, army, group, advanced, to, the, rhine, in, operation, veritable, and, operation, grenade, it, crossed, the, rhine, on, 24, march, 1945, in, operation, plunder, which, took, place, two, weeks, after, u, s, first, army, had, crossed, the, rhine, after, capturing, the, ludendorff, bridge, during, the, battle, of, remagen, 21st, army, group, s, river, crossing, was, followed, by, the, encirclement, of, the, ruhr, pocket, during, this, battle, u, s, ninth, army, which, had, remained, part, of, 21st, army, group, after, the, battle, of, the, bulge, formed, the, northern, arm, of, the, envelopment, of, german, army, group, b, with, u, s, first, army, forming, the, southern, arm, the, two, armies, linked, up, on, 1, april, 1945, encircling, 370, 000, german, troops, and, on, 4, april, 1945, ninth, army, reverted, to, omar, bradley, s, 12th, army, group, by, the, war, s, end, the, remaining, formations, of, 21st, army, group, first, canadian, army, and, british, second, army, had, liberated, the, northern, part, of, the, netherlands, and, captured, much, of, north, west, germany, occupied, hamburg, and, rostock, and, sealed, off, the, danish, peninsula, on, 4, may, 1945, on, l, neburg, heath, montgomery, accepted, the, surrender, of, german, forces, in, north, west, germany, denmark, and, the, netherlands, the, british, high, command, were, not, only, concerned, with, winning, the, war, and, defeating, germany, but, also, with, ensuring, that, it, retained, sufficient, influence, in, the, post, war, world, to, govern, global, policy, suffering, heavy, losses, in, normandy, would, diminish, british, leadership, and, prestige, within, its, empire, and, on, post, war, europe, in, particular, many, of, montgomery, s, clashes, with, eisenhower, were, based, on, his, determination, to, pursue, the, war, on, lines, most, suitable, to, britain, the, fewer, the, number, of, combat, experienced, divisions, the, british, had, left, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, smaller, britain, s, influence, in, europe, was, likely, to, be, compared, to, the, emerging, superpowers, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, montgomery, was, thus, caught, in, a, dilemma, the, british, army, needed, to, be, seen, to, be, pulling, at, least, half, the, weight, in, the, liberation, of, europe, but, without, incurring, the, heavy, casualties, that, such, a, role, would, inevitably, produce, 21st, army, group, scarcely, possessed, sufficient, forces, to, achieve, such, a, military, prominence, and, the, remaining, divisions, had, to, be, expended, sparingly, in, 1944, britain, did, not, possess, the, manpower, to, rebuild, shattered, divisions, and, it, was, imperative, for, montgomery, to, protect, the, viability, of, the, british, army, it, was, reported, to, the, war, office, that, montgomery, has, to, be, very, careful, of, what, he, does, on, his, eastern, flank, because, on, that, flank, is, the, only, british, army, there, is, left, in, this, part, of, the, world, the, context, of, british, casualties, and, the, shortage, of, reinforcements, prompted, montgomery, to, excessive, caution, dempsey, wrote, on, 13, june, that, caen, could, only, be, taken, by, a, set, piece, assault, and, we, did, not, have, the, men, or, the, ammunition, for, that, at, the, time, montgomery, s, solution, to, the, dilemma, was, to, attempt, to, remain, commander, of, all, land, forces, until, the, end, of, the, war, so, that, any, victory, attained, on, the, western, front, although, achieved, primarily, by, american, formations, would, accrue, in, part, to, him, and, thus, to, britain, he, would, also, be, able, to, ensure, that, british, units, were, spared, some, of, the, high, attrition, actions, but, would, be, most, prominent, when, the, final, blows, were, struck, when, that, strategy, failed, he, persuaded, eisenhower, to, occasionally, put, some, american, formations, under, the, control, of, the, 21st, army, group, so, as, to, bolster, his, resources, while, still, maintaining, the, outward, appearance, of, successful, british, effort, montgomery, initially, remained, prepared, to, push, second, british, army, hard, to, capture, the, vital, strategic, town, of, caen, and, consequently, incur, heavy, losses, in, the, original, overlord, plan, montgomery, was, determined, to, push, past, caen, to, falaise, as, quickly, as, possible, however, after, the, heavy, casualties, incurred, in, capturing, caen, he, changed, his, mind, montgomery, was, notorious, for, his, lack, of, tact, and, diplomacy, even, his, patron, the, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, general, sir, alan, brooke, frequently, mentions, it, in, his, war, diaries, he, is, liable, to, commit, untold, errors, in, lack, of, tact, and, i, had, to, haul, him, over, the, coals, for, his, usual, lack, of, tact, and, egotistical, outlook, which, prevented, him, from, appreciating, other, people, s, feelings, one, incident, that, illustrated, this, occurred, during, the, north, african, campaign, when, montgomery, bet, walter, bedell, smith, that, he, could, capture, sfax, by, the, middle, of, april, 1943, smith, jokingly, replied, that, if, montgomery, could, do, it, he, would, give, him, a, flying, fortress, complete, with, crew, smith, promptly, forgot, all, about, it, but, montgomery, did, not, and, when, sfax, was, taken, on, 10, april, he, sent, a, message, to, smith, claiming, his, winnings, smith, tried, to, laugh, it, off, but, montgomery, was, having, none, of, it, and, insisted, on, his, aircraft, it, got, as, high, as, eisenhower, who, with, his, renowned, skill, in, diplomacy, ensured, montgomery, did, get, his, flying, fortress, though, at, a, great, cost, in, ill, feeling, antony, beevor, in, discussing, montgomery, s, counterproductive, lack, of, tact, in, the, final, months, of, the, war, described, him, as, insufferable, beevor, says, that, in, january, 1945, montgomery, had, tried, to, claim, far, too, much, credit, for, the, british, and, for, himself, in, defeating, the, german, counter, attack, in, the, ardennes, in, december, 1944, this, crass, and, unpleasant, blunder, helped, make, it, impossible, for, churchill, and, alan, brooke, to, persuade, eisenhower, of, the, need, for, an, immediate, thrust, to, be, led, by, montgomery, through, germany, to, berlin, eisenhower, did, not, accept, the, viability, of, the, dagger, thrust, approach, it, had, already, been, agreed, that, berlin, would, fall, into, the, future, soviet, occupation, zone, and, he, was, not, willing, to, accept, heavy, casualties, for, no, gain, so, eisenhower, disregarded, the, british, suggestions, and, continued, with, his, conservative, broad, front, strategy, and, the, red, army, reached, berlin, well, ahead, of, the, western, allies, in, august, 1945, while, brooke, sir, andrew, cunningham, and, sir, charles, portal, were, discussing, their, possible, successors, as, chiefs, of, staff, they, concluded,
