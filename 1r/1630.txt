https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday
michael, faraday, frs, f, r, d, e, d, i, 22, september, 1791, 25, august, 1867, was, an, english, scientist, who, contributed, to, the, study, of, electromagnetism, and, electrochemistry, his, main, discoveries, include, the, principles, underlying, electromagnetic, induction, diamagnetism, and, electrolysis, although, faraday, received, little, formal, education, as, a, self, made, man, he, was, one, of, the, most, influential, scientists, in, history, it, was, by, his, research, on, the, magnetic, field, around, a, conductor, carrying, a, direct, current, that, faraday, established, the, concept, of, the, electromagnetic, field, in, physics, faraday, also, established, that, magnetism, could, affect, rays, of, light, and, that, there, was, an, underlying, relationship, between, the, two, phenomena, he, similarly, discovered, the, principles, of, electromagnetic, induction, diamagnetism, and, the, laws, of, electrolysis, his, inventions, of, electromagnetic, rotary, devices, formed, the, foundation, of, electric, motor, technology, and, it, was, largely, due, to, his, efforts, that, electricity, became, practical, for, use, in, technology, as, a, chemist, faraday, discovered, benzene, investigated, the, clathrate, hydrate, of, chlorine, invented, an, early, form, of, the, bunsen, burner, and, the, system, of, oxidation, numbers, and, popularised, terminology, such, as, anode, cathode, electrode, and, ion, faraday, ultimately, became, the, first, and, foremost, fullerian, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, royal, institution, a, lifetime, position, faraday, was, an, experimentalist, who, conveyed, his, ideas, in, clear, and, simple, language, his, mathematical, abilities, did, not, extend, as, far, as, trigonometry, and, were, limited, to, the, simplest, algebra, james, clerk, maxwell, took, the, work, of, faraday, and, others, and, summarised, it, in, a, set, of, equations, which, is, accepted, as, the, basis, of, all, modern, theories, of, electromagnetic, phenomena, on, faraday, s, uses, of, lines, of, force, maxwell, wrote, that, they, show, faraday, to, have, been, in, reality, a, mathematician, of, a, very, high, order, one, from, whom, the, mathematicians, of, the, future, may, derive, valuable, and, fertile, methods, the, si, unit, of, capacitance, is, named, in, his, honour, the, farad, albert, einstein, kept, a, picture, of, faraday, on, his, study, wall, alongside, pictures, of, isaac, newton, and, james, clerk, maxwell, physicist, ernest, rutherford, stated, when, we, consider, the, magnitude, and, extent, of, his, discoveries, and, their, influence, on, the, progress, of, science, and, of, industry, there, is, no, honour, too, great, to, pay, to, the, memory, of, faraday, one, of, the, greatest, scientific, discoverers, of, all, time, michael, faraday, was, born, on, 22, september, 1791, in, newington, butts, surrey, which, is, now, part, of, the, london, borough, of, southwark, his, family, was, not, well, off, his, father, james, was, a, member, of, the, glasite, sect, of, christianity, james, faraday, moved, his, wife, margaret, n, e, hastwell, and, two, children, to, london, during, the, winter, of, 1790, from, outhgill, in, westmorland, where, he, had, been, an, apprentice, to, the, village, blacksmith, michael, was, born, in, the, autumn, of, that, year, the, third, of, four, children, the, young, michael, faraday, having, only, the, most, basic, school, education, had, to, educate, himself, at, the, age, of, 14, he, became, an, apprentice, to, george, riebau, a, local, bookbinder, and, bookseller, in, blandford, street, during, his, seven, year, apprenticeship, faraday, read, many, books, including, isaac, watts, s, the, improvement, of, the, mind, and, he, enthusiastically, implemented, the, principles, and, suggestions, contained, therein, during, this, period, faraday, held, discussions, with, his, peers, in, the, city, philosophical, society, where, he, attended, lectures, about, various, scientific, topics, he, also, developed, an, interest, in, science, especially, in, electricity, faraday, was, particularly, inspired, by, the, book, conversations, on, chemistry, by, jane, marcet, in, 1812, at, the, age, of, 20, and, at, the, end, of, his, apprenticeship, faraday, attended, lectures, by, the, eminent, english, chemist, humphry, davy, of, the, royal, institution, and, the, royal, society, and, john, tatum, founder, of, the, city, philosophical, society, many, of, the, tickets, for, these, lectures, were, given, to, faraday, by, william, dance, who, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, royal, philharmonic, society, faraday, subsequently, sent, davy, a, 300, page, book, based, on, notes, that, he, had, taken, during, these, lectures, davy, s, reply, was, immediate, kind, and, favourable, in, 1813, when, davy, damaged, his, eyesight, in, an, accident, with, nitrogen, trichloride, he, decided, to, employ, faraday, as, an, assistant, coincidentally, one, of, the, royal, institution, s, assistants, john, payne, was, sacked, and, sir, humphry, davy, had, been, asked, to, find, a, replacement, thus, he, appointed, faraday, as, chemical, assistant, at, the, royal, institution, on, 1, march, 1813, very, soon, davy, entrusted, faraday, with, the, preparation, of, nitrogen, trichloride, samples, and, they, both, were, injured, in, an, explosion, of, this, very, sensitive, substance, faraday, married, sarah, barnard, 1800, 1879, on, 12, june, 1821, they, met, through, their, families, at, the, sandemanian, church, and, he, confessed, his, faith, to, the, sandemanian, congregation, the, month, after, they, were, married, they, had, no, children, faraday, was, a, devout, christian, his, sandemanian, denomination, was, an, offshoot, of, the, church, of, scotland, well, after, his, marriage, he, served, as, deacon, and, for, two, terms, as, an, elder, in, the, meeting, house, of, his, youth, his, church, was, located, at, paul, s, alley, in, the, barbican, this, meeting, house, relocated, in, 1862, to, barnsbury, grove, islington, this, north, london, location, was, where, faraday, served, the, final, two, years, of, his, second, term, as, elder, prior, to, his, resignation, from, that, post, biographers, have, noted, that, a, strong, sense, of, the, unity, of, god, and, nature, pervaded, faraday, s, life, and, work, in, june, 1832, the, university, of, oxford, granted, faraday, an, honorary, doctor, of, civil, law, degree, during, his, lifetime, he, was, offered, a, knighthood, in, recognition, for, his, services, to, science, which, he, turned, down, on, religious, grounds, believing, that, it, was, against, the, word, of, the, bible, to, accumulate, riches, and, pursue, worldly, reward, and, stating, that, he, preferred, to, remain, plain, mr, faraday, to, the, end, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1824, he, twice, refused, to, become, president, he, became, the, first, fullerian, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, royal, institution, in, 1833, in, 1832, faraday, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1838, in, 1840, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, he, was, one, of, eight, foreign, members, elected, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1844, in, 1849, he, was, elected, as, associated, member, to, the, royal, institute, of, the, netherlands, which, two, years, later, became, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, and, he, was, subsequently, made, foreign, member, faraday, had, a, nervous, breakdown, in, 1839, but, eventually, returned, to, his, investigations, into, electromagnetism, in, 1848, as, a, result, of, representations, by, the, prince, consort, faraday, was, awarded, a, grace, and, favour, house, in, hampton, court, in, middlesex, free, of, all, expenses, and, upkeep, this, was, the, master, mason, s, house, later, called, faraday, house, and, now, no, 37, hampton, court, road, in, 1858, faraday, retired, to, live, there, having, provided, a, number, of, various, service, projects, for, the, british, government, when, asked, by, the, government, to, advise, on, the, production, of, chemical, weapons, for, use, in, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, faraday, refused, to, participate, citing, ethical, reasons, he, also, refused, offers, to, publish, his, lectures, believing, that, they, would, lose, impact, if, not, accompanied, by, the, live, experiments, his, reply, to, an, offer, from, a, publisher, in, a, letter, ends, with, i, have, always, loved, science, more, than, money, because, my, occupation, is, almost, entirely, personal, i, cannot, afford, to, get, rich, faraday, died, at, his, house, at, hampton, court, on, 25, august, 1867, aged, 75, he, had, some, years, before, turned, down, an, offer, of, burial, in, westminster, abbey, upon, his, death, but, he, has, a, memorial, plaque, there, near, isaac, newton, s, tomb, faraday, was, interred, in, the, dissenters, non, anglican, section, of, highgate, cemetery, faraday, s, earliest, chemical, work, was, as, an, assistant, to, humphry, davy, faraday, was, involved, in, the, study, of, chlorine, he, discovered, two, new, compounds, of, chlorine, and, carbon, hexachloroethane, which, he, made, via, the, chlorination, of, ethylene, and, carbon, tetrachloride, from, the, decomposition, of, the, former, he, also, conducted, the, first, rough, experiments, on, the, diffusion, of, gases, a, phenomenon, that, was, first, pointed, out, by, john, dalton, the, physical, importance, of, this, phenomenon, was, more, fully, revealed, by, thomas, graham, and, joseph, loschmidt, faraday, succeeded, in, liquefying, several, gases, investigated, the, alloys, of, steel, and, produced, several, new, kinds, of, glass, intended, for, optical, purposes, a, specimen, of, one, of, these, heavy, glasses, subsequently, became, historically, important, when, the, glass, was, placed, in, a, magnetic, field, faraday, determined, the, rotation, of, the, plane, of, polarisation, of, light, this, specimen, was, also, the, first, substance, found, to, be, repelled, by, the, poles, of, a, magnet, faraday, invented, an, early, form, of, what, was, to, become, the, bunsen, burner, which, is, still, in, practical, use, in, science, laboratories, around, the, world, as, a, convenient, source, of, heat, faraday, worked, extensively, in, the, field, of, chemistry, discovering, chemical, substances, such, as, benzene, which, he, called, bicarburet, of, hydrogen, and, liquefying, gases, such, as, chlorine, the, liquefying, of, gases, helped, to, establish, that, gases, are, the, vapours, of, liquids, possessing, a, very, low, boiling, point, and, gave, a, more, solid, basis, to, the, concept, of, molecular, aggregation, in, 1820, faraday, reported, the, first, synthesis, of, compounds, made, from, carbon, and, chlorine, c, 2, cl, 6, and, ccl, 4, and, published, his, results, the, following, year, faraday, also, determined, the, composition, of, the, chlorine, clathrate, hydrate, which, had, been, discovered, by, humphry, davy, in, 1810, faraday, is, also, responsible, for, discovering, the, laws, of, electrolysis, and, for, popularising, terminology, such, as, anode, cathode, electrode, and, ion, terms, proposed, in, large, part, by, william, whewell, faraday, was, the, first, to, report, what, later, came, to, be, called, metallic, nanoparticles, in, 1847, he, discovered, that, the, optical, properties, of, gold, colloids, differed, from, those, of, the, corresponding, bulk, metal, this, was, probably, the, first, reported, observation, of, the, effects, of, quantum, size, and, might, be, considered, to, be, the, birth, of, nanoscience, faraday, is, best, known, for, his, work, on, electricity, and, magnetism, his, first, recorded, experiment, was, the, construction, of, a, voltaic, pile, with, seven, british, halfpenny, coins, stacked, together, with, seven, discs, of, sheet, zinc, and, six, pieces, of, paper, moistened, with, salt, water, with, this, pile, he, passed, the, electric, current, through, a, solution, of, sulfate, of, magnesia, and, succeeded, in, decomposing, the, chemical, compound, recorded, in, first, letter, to, abbott, 12, july, 1812, in, 1821, soon, after, the, danish, physicist, and, chemist, hans, christian, rsted, discovered, the, phenomenon, of, electromagnetism, davy, and, william, hyde, wollaston, tried, but, failed, to, design, an, electric, motor, faraday, having, discussed, the, problem, with, the, two, men, went, on, to, build, two, devices, to, produce, what, he, called, electromagnetic, rotation, one, of, these, now, known, as, the, homopolar, motor, caused, a, continuous, circular, motion, that, was, engendered, by, the, circular, magnetic, force, around, a, wire, that, extended, into, a, pool, of, mercury, wherein, was, placed, a, magnet, the, wire, would, then, rotate, around, the, magnet, if, supplied, with, current, from, a, chemical, battery, these, experiments, and, inventions, formed, the, foundation, of, modern, electromagnetic, technology, in, his, excitement, faraday, published, results, without, acknowledging, his, work, with, either, wollaston, or, davy, the, resulting, controversy, within, the, royal, society, strained, his, mentor, relationship, with, davy, and, may, well, have, contributed, to, faraday, s, assignment, to, other, activities, which, consequently, prevented, his, involvement, in, electromagnetic, research, for, several, years, from, his, initial, discovery, in, 1821, faraday, continued, his, laboratory, work, exploring, electromagnetic, properties, of, materials, and, developing, requisite, experience, in, 1824, faraday, briefly, set, up, a, circuit, to, study, whether, a, magnetic, field, could, regulate, the, flow, of, a, current, in, an, adjacent, wire, but, he, found, no, such, relationship, this, experiment, followed, similar, work, conducted, with, light, and, magnets, three, years, earlier, that, yielded, identical, results, during, the, next, seven, years, faraday, spent, much, of, his, time, perfecting, his, recipe, for, optical, quality, heavy, glass, borosilicate, of, lead, which, he, used, in, his, future, studies, connecting, light, with, magnetism, in, his, spare, time, faraday, continued, publishing, his, experimental, work, on, optics, and, electromagnetism, he, conducted, correspondence, with, scientists, whom, he, had, met, on, his, journeys, across, europe, with, davy, and, who, were, also, working, on, electromagnetism, two, years, after, the, death, of, davy, in, 1831, he, began, his, great, series, of, experiments, in, which, he, discovered, electromagnetic, induction, recording, in, his, laboratory, diary, on, 28, october, 1831, that, he, was, making, many, experiments, with, the, great, magnet, of, the, royal, society, faraday, s, breakthrough, came, when, he, wrapped, two, insulated, coils, of, wire, around, an, iron, ring, and, found, that, upon, passing, a, current, through, one, coil, a, momentary, current, was, induced, in, the, other, coil, this, phenomenon, is, now, known, as, mutual, inductance, the, iron, ring, coil, apparatus, is, still, on, display, at, the, royal, institution, in, subsequent, experiments, he, found, that, if, he, moved, a, magnet, through, a, loop, of, wire, an, electric, current, flowed, in, that, wire, the, current, also, flowed, if, the, loop, was, moved, over, a, stationary, magnet, his, demonstrations, established, that, a, changing, magnetic, field, produces, an, electric, field, this, relation, was, modelled, mathematically, by, james, clerk, maxwell, as, faraday, s, law, which, subsequently, became, one, of, the, four, maxwell, equations, and, which, have, in, turn, evolved, into, the, generalization, known, today, as, field, theory, faraday, would, later, use, the, principles, he, had, discovered, to, construct, the, electric, dynamo, the, ancestor, of, modern, power, generators, and, the, electric, motor, in, 1832, he, completed, a, series, of, experiments, aimed, at, investigating, the, fundamental, nature, of, electricity, faraday, used, static, batteries, and, animal, electricity, to, produce, the, phenomena, of, electrostatic, attraction, electrolysis, magnetism, etc, he, concluded, that, contrary, to, the, scientific, opinion, of, the, time, the, divisions, between, the, various, kinds, of, electricity, were, illusory, faraday, instead, proposed, that, only, a, single, electricity, exists, and, the, changing, values, of, quantity, and, intensity, current, and, voltage, would, produce, different, groups, of, phenomena, near, the, end, of, his, career, faraday, proposed, that, electromagnetic, forces, extended, into, the, empty, space, around, the, conductor, this, idea, was, rejected, by, his, fellow, scientists, and, faraday, did, not, live, to, see, the, eventual, acceptance, of, his, proposition, by, the, scientific, community, it, would, be, another, half, a, century, before, electricity, was, used, in, technology, with, the, west, end, s, savoy, theatre, fitted, with, the, incandescent, light, bulb, developed, by, sir, joseph, swan, the, first, public, building, in, the, world, to, be, lit, by, electricity, as, recorded, by, the, royal, institution, faraday, invented, the, generator, in, 1831, but, it, took, nearly, 50, years, before, all, the, technology, including, joseph, swan, s, incandescent, filament, light, bulbs, used, here, came, into, common, use, in, 1845, faraday, discovered, that, many, materials, exhibit, a, weak, repulsion, from, a, magnetic, field, an, effect, he, termed, diamagnetism, faraday, also, discovered, that, the, plane, of, polarization, of, linearly, polarised, light, can, be, rotated, by, the, application, of, an, external, magnetic, field, aligned, with, the, direction, in, which, the, light, is, moving, this, is, now, termed, the, faraday, effect, in, sept, 1845, he, wrote, in, his, notebook, i, have, at, last, succeeded, in, illuminating, a, magnetic, curve, or, line, of, force, and, in, magnetising, a, ray, of, light, later, on, in, his, life, in, 1862, faraday, used, a, spectroscope, to, search, for, a, different, alteration, of, light, the, change, of, spectral, lines, by, an, applied, magnetic, field, the, equipment, available, to, him, was, however, insufficient, for, a, definite, determination, of, spectral, change, pieter, zeeman, later, used, an, improved, apparatus, to, study, the, same, phenomenon, publishing, his, results, in, 1897, and, receiving, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, success, in, both, his, 1897, paper, and, his, nobel, acceptance, speech, zeeman, made, reference, to, faraday, s, work, in, his, work, on, static, electricity, faraday, s, ice, pail, experiment, demonstrated, that, the, charge, resided, only, on, the, exterior, of, a, charged, conductor, and, exterior, charge, had, no, influence, on, anything, enclosed, within, a, conductor, this, is, because, the, exterior, charges, redistribute, such, that, the, interior, fields, emanating, from, them, cancel, one, another, this, shielding, effect, is, used, in, what, is, now, known, as, a, faraday, cage, in, january, 1836, faraday, had, put, a, wooden, frame, 12, ft, square, on, four, glass, supports, and, added, paper, walls, and, wire, mesh, he, then, stepped, inside, and, electrified, it, when, he, stepped, out, of, his, electrified, cage, faraday, had, shown, that, electricity, was, a, force, not, an, imponderable, fluid, as, was, believed, at, the, time, faraday, had, a, long, association, with, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, he, was, appointed, assistant, superintendent, of, the, house, of, the, royal, institution, in, 1821, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1824, in, 1825, he, became, director, of, the, laboratory, of, the, royal, institution, six, years, later, in, 1833, faraday, became, the, first, fullerian, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, a, position, to, which, he, was, appointed, for, life, without, the, obligation, to, deliver, lectures, his, sponsor, and, mentor, was, john, mad, jack, fuller, who, created, the, position, at, the, royal, institution, for, faraday, beyond, his, scientific, research, into, areas, such, as, chemistry, electricity, and, magnetism, at, the, royal, institution, faraday, undertook, numerous, and, often, time, consuming, service, projects, for, private, enterprise, and, the, british, government, this, work, included, investigations, of, explosions, in, coal, mines, being, an, expert, witness, in, court, and, along, with, two, engineers, from, chance, brothers, c, 1853, the, preparation, of, high, quality, optical, glass, which, was, required, by, chance, for, its, lighthouses, in, 1846, together, with, charles, lyell, he, produced, a, lengthy, and, detailed, report, on, a, serious, explosion, in, the, colliery, at, haswell, county, durham, which, killed, 95, miners, their, report, was, a, meticulous, forensic, investigation, and, indicated, that, coal, dust, contributed, to, the, severity, of, the, explosion, the, first, time, explosions, had, been, linked, to, dust, faraday, gave, a, demonstration, during, a, lecture, on, how, ventilation, could, prevent, it, the, report, should, have, warned, coal, owners, of, the, hazard, of, coal, dust, explosions, but, the, risk, was, ignored, for, over, 60, years, until, the, 1913, senghenydd, colliery, disaster, as, a, respected, scientist, in, a, nation, with, strong, maritime, interests, faraday, spent, extensive, amounts, of, time, on, projects, such, as, the, construction, and, operation, of, lighthouses, and, protecting, the, bottoms, of, ships, from, corrosion, his, workshop, still, stands, at, trinity, buoy, wharf, above, the, chain, and, buoy, store, next, to, london, s, only, lighthouse, where, he, carried, out, the, first, experiments, in, electric, lighting, for, lighthouses, faraday, was, also, active, in, what, would, now, be, called, environmental, science, or, engineering, he, investigated, industrial, pollution, at, swansea, and, was, consulted, on, air, pollution, at, the, royal, mint, in, july, 1855, faraday, wrote, a, letter, to, the, times, on, the, subject, of, the, foul, condition, of, the, river, thames, which, resulted, in, an, often, reprinted, cartoon, in, punch, see, also, the, great, stink, faraday, assisted, with, the, planning, and, judging, of, exhibits, for, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, in, hyde, park, london, he, also, advised, the, national, gallery, on, the, cleaning, and, protection, of, its, art, collection, and, served, on, the, national, gallery, site, commission, in, 1857, education, was, another, of, faraday, s, areas, of, service, he, lectured, on, the, topic, in, 1854, at, the, royal, institution, and, in, 1862, he, appeared, before, a, public, schools, commission, to, give, his, views, on, education, in, great, britain, faraday, also, weighed, in, negatively, on, the, public, s, fascination, with, table, turning, mesmerism, and, seances, and, in, so, doing, chastised, both, the, public, and, the, nation, s, educational, system, before, his, famous, christmas, lectures, faraday, delivered, chemistry, lectures, for, the, city, philosophical, society, from, 1816, to, 1818, in, order, to, refine, the, quality, of, his, lectures, between, 1827, and, 1860, at, the, royal, institution, in, london, faraday, gave, a, series, of, nineteen, christmas, lectures, for, young, people, a, series, which, continues, today, the, objective, of, the, lectures, was, to, present, science, to, the, general, public, in, the, hopes, of, inspiring, them, and, generating, revenue, for, the, royal, institution, they, were, notable, events, on, the, social, calendar, among, london, s, gentry, over, the, course, of, several, letters, to, his, close, friend, benjamin, abbott, faraday, outlined, his, recommendations, on, the, art, of, lecturing, writing, a, flame, should, be, lighted, at, the, commencement, and, kept, alive, with, unremitting, splendour, to, the, end, his, lectures, were, joyful, and, juvenile, he, delighted, in, filling, soap, bubbles, with, various, gasses, in, order, to, determine, whether, or, not, they, are, magnetic, but, the, lectures, were, also, deeply, philosophical, in, his, lectures, he, urged, his, audiences, to, consider, the, mechanics, of, his, experiments, you, know, very, well, that, ice, floats, upon, water, why, does, the, ice, float, think, of, that, and, philosophise, the, subjects, in, his, lectures, consisted, of, chemistry, and, electricity, and, included, 1841, the, rudiments, of, chemistry, 1843, first, principles, of, electricity, 1848, the, chemical, history, of, a, candle, 1851, attractive, forces, 1853, voltaic, electricity, 1854, the, chemistry, of, combustion, 1855, the, distinctive, properties, of, the, common, metals, 1857, static, electricity, 1858, the, metallic, properties, 1859, the, various, forces, of, matter, and, their, relations, to, each, other, a, statue, of, michael, faraday, stands, in, savoy, place, london, outside, the, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, the, faraday, memorial, designed, by, brutalist, architect, rodney, gordon, and, completed, in, 1961, is, at, the,
