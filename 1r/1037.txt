greece, and, formed, an, alliance, with, antipater, later, joined, by, ptolemy, against, perdiccas, perdiccas, was, murdered, by, his, own, officers, in, 320, bc, and, antipater, was, elected, the, new, regent, during, a, series, of, wars, between, alexander, s, successors, antigonus, briefly, emerged, as, the, most, powerful, of, the, diadochi, ruling, over, greece, asia, minor, syria, phoenicia, and, northern, mesopotamia, cassander, seleucus, ptolemy, and, lysimachus, formed, a, coalition, against, him, which, culminated, in, his, decisive, defeat, and, death, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, his, kingdom, was, divided, up, by, lysimachus, and, seleucus, but, his, son, demetrius, survived, and, went, on, to, seize, control, of, macedonia, in, 294, bc, antigonus, was, born, in, macedonia, around, 382, bc, to, a, nobleman, named, philip, and, his, wife, whose, name, is, unknown, while, some, sources, claim, that, antigonus, came, from, peasant, or, yeoman, stock, others, that, his, family, was, linked, to, the, macedonian, royal, house, both, seem, unlikely, n, all, probability, the, family, was, socially, prominent, and, from, the, macedonian, nobility, not, much, is, known, about, antigonus, early, career, he, must, have, been, an, important, figure, in, the, macedonian, army, as, by, the, time, he, emerges, in, historical, sources, he, is, noted, as, being, in, command, of, a, large, part, of, alexander, s, army, with, responsibility, over, approximately, 7, 000, allied, greek, infantry, there, is, an, anecdote, recorded, by, plutarch, about, an, antigonus, who, lost, an, eye, at, the, siege, of, perinthus, in, 340, bc, after, a, catapult, bolt, struck, him, in, the, eye, according, to, historian, richard, billows, this, story, fits, antigonos, better, than, we, know, it, to, fit, anyone, else, since, antigonus, was, of, the, same, age, as, philip, and, a, nobleman, he, almost, certainly, served, in, philip, s, campaigns, possibly, under, philip, s, brothers, alexander, ii, and, perdiccas, iii, his, importance, at, philip, s, court, is, shown, by, the, friendships, he, established, with, antipater, and, eumenes, two, of, philip, s, chief, lieutenants, in, 334, bc, antigonus, served, as, the, commander, of, the, allied, greek, infantry, a, division, of, alexander, s, invasion, army, of, the, persian, empire, alexander, did, not, trust, his, greek, infantry, and, had, left, them, behind, when, he, marched, to, confront, the, western, satraps, therefore, antigonus, did, not, participate, in, the, battle, of, the, granicus, when, alexander, marched, east, he, appointed, antigonus, as, satrap, of, phrygia, as, satrap, of, phrygia, antigonus, besieged, a, garrison, of, mercenaries, 1, 000, carians, and, 100, greeks, the, persians, had, left, behind, and, after, their, surrender, he, enrolled, them, in, his, service, allowing, him, to, send, his, own, greek, troops, 1, 500, mercenaries, to, reinforce, alexander, for, the, major, battle, that, was, about, to, be, fought, at, issus, after, the, battle, of, issus, he, succeeded, the, achaemenid, satrap, of, greater, phrygia, atizyes, who, had, died, during, the, battle, antigonus, successfully, performed, his, primary, responsibility, to, defend, alexander, s, lines, of, supply, and, communication, during, the, latter, s, extended, campaign, against, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, following, alexander, s, victory, at, issus, part, of, the, persian, army, regrouped, in, cappadocia, and, attempted, to, sever, alexander, s, lines, of, supply, and, communication, running, through, the, centre, of, asia, minor, however, antigonus, defeated, the, persian, forces, in, three, separate, battles, after, defeating, the, persian, counter, attack, antigonus, focused, on, conquering, the, rest, of, phrygia, and, maintaining, alexander, s, lines, of, communication, and, supply, at, the, division, of, the, provinces, the, so, called, partition, of, babylon, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, antigonus, held, authority, over, phrygia, lycaonia, pamphylia, lycia, and, western, pisidia, confirmed, by, perdiccas, the, regent, of, the, empire, however, he, incurred, the, enmity, of, perdiccas, by, refusing, to, assist, eumenes, to, obtain, possession, of, the, provinces, allotted, to, him, paphlagonia, and, cappadocia, leonnatus, had, left, with, his, army, for, greece, leaving, antigonus, alone, to, deal, with, cappadocia, a, task, he, apparently, could, not, or, would, not, complete, without, additional, aid, perdiccas, seems, to, have, viewed, this, as, a, direct, affront, to, his, authority, and, led, the, royal, army, to, conquer, the, area, from, there, perdiccas, turned, west, towards, phrygia, as, a, provocation, toward, antigonus, who, escaped, with, his, son, demetrius, to, greece, where, he, obtained, the, favor, of, antipater, the, viceroy, of, macedonia, 321, bc, and, craterus, one, of, alexander, s, top, generals, during, the, first, war, of, the, diadochi, he, formed, a, coalition, with, antipater, craterus, and, ptolemy, in, 320, bc, antigonus, sailed, to, and, secured, cyprus, the, war, ended, in, 320, bc, when, perdiccas, was, murdered, by, discontented, officers, seleucus, and, antigenes, while, unsuccessfully, trying, to, invade, ptolemy, s, satrapy, of, egypt, with, the, death, of, perdiccas, in, 321, bc, a, new, attempt, at, dividing, the, empire, took, place, at, triparadisus, antipater, was, made, the, new, regent, of, the, empire, and, antigonus, became, strategos, of, asia, antigonus, was, entrusted, with, the, command, of, the, war, against, the, former, members, of, the, perdiccan, faction, who, had, been, condemned, at, triparadisus, antigonus, took, charge, of, a, part, of, the, royal, army, and, after, being, reinforced, with, more, reliable, troops, from, antipater, s, european, army, he, marched, against, the, ex, perdiccans, eumenes, alketas, domikos, attalos, and, polemon, in, asia, minor, antigonus, decided, to, first, deal, with, eumenes, who, was, in, cappadocia, despite, being, outnumbered, antigonus, adopted, a, bold, aggressive, strategy, he, eventually, out, generaled, and, defeated, eumenes, at, the, battle, of, orkynia, forcing, him, to, retire, to, the, fortress, of, nora, greek, leaving, eumenes, under, siege, antigonus, now, marched, on, the, combined, forces, of, alcetas, dokimos, attalos, and, polemon, near, cretopolis, in, pisidia, antigonus, surprised, and, defeated, his, opponents, at, the, battle, of, cretopolis, antigonus, in, two, brilliant, campaigns, in, the, course, of, one, campaigning, season, had, annihilated, the, remnants, of, the, perdiccan, faction, with, the, exception, of, eumenes, who, was, bottled, up, in, nora, when, antipater, died, in, 319, bc, he, left, the, regentship, to, polyperchon, excluding, cassander, his, son, antigonus, and, the, other, dynasts, refused, to, recognize, polyperchon, since, it, would, have, undermined, their, own, ambitions, antigonus, entered, into, negotiations, with, eumenes, but, eumenes, had, already, been, swayed, by, polyperchon, who, gave, him, authority, over, all, other, generals, within, the, empire, affecting, his, escape, from, nora, through, trickery, eumenes, raised, a, small, army, and, fled, south, into, cilicia, antigonus, did, not, move, against, eumenes, directly, because, he, was, tied, up, in, northwestern, asia, minor, campaigning, against, cleitus, the, white, who, had, a, large, fleet, at, the, hellespont, cleitus, was, able, to, defeat, antigonus, s, admiral, nicanor, in, a, sea, battle, but, he, was, caught, off, guard, the, next, morning, when, antigonus, and, nicanor, launched, a, double, assault, by, land, and, sea, on, his, camp, cleitus, was, taken, completely, by, surprise, and, his, entire, force, was, captured, or, killed, see, battle, of, byzantium, meanwhile, eumenes, had, taken, control, of, cilicia, syria, and, phoenicia, he, had, formed, an, alliance, with, antigenes, and, teutamos, the, commanders, of, the, silver, shields, and, the, hypaspists, and, began, to, raise, a, naval, force, on, behalf, of, polyperchon, when, it, was, ready, he, sent, the, fleet, west, to, reinforce, polyperchon, but, off, the, coast, of, cilicia, it, was, met, by, antigonus, s, fleet, and, changed, sides, antigonus, had, settled, his, affairs, in, asia, minor, and, marched, east, into, cilicia, intent, on, doing, battle, with, eumenes, in, syria, eumenes, somehow, had, advance, knowledge, of, this, and, marched, out, of, phoenicia, through, syria, into, mesopotamia, with, the, idea, of, gathering, support, in, the, upper, satrapies, eumenes, gained, the, support, of, amphimachos, the, satrap, of, mesopotamia, then, marched, his, army, into, northern, babylonia, where, he, put, them, into, winter, quarters, during, the, winter, he, negotiated, with, seleucus, the, satrap, of, babylonia, and, peithon, the, satrap, of, media, seeking, their, help, against, antigonus, antigonus, finding, out, eumenes, had, left, his, provinces, took, some, time, securing, cilicia, and, northern, syria, before, he, marched, into, mesopotamia, unable, to, sway, seleucus, and, pheiton, eumenes, had, left, his, winter, quarters, early, and, marched, on, susa, a, major, royal, treasury, in, susiana, in, susa, eumenes, sent, letters, to, all, the, satraps, to, the, north, and, east, of, susiana, ordering, them, in, the, kings, names, to, join, him, with, all, their, forces, when, the, satraps, joined, eumenes, he, had, a, considerable, force, with, which, he, could, look, forward, with, some, confidence, to, doing, battle, against, antigonus, eumenes, then, marched, southeastwards, into, persia, where, he, picked, up, additional, reinforcements, antigonus, meanwhile, had, reached, susa, and, left, seleucus, there, to, besiege, the, place, while, he, himself, marched, after, eumenes, at, the, river, kopratas, eumenes, surprised, antigonus, during, the, crossing, of, the, river, and, killed, or, captured, 4, 000, of, his, men, antigonus, faced, with, disaster, decided, to, abandon, the, crossing, and, turned, back, northward, marching, up, into, media, threatening, the, upper, satrapies, eumenes, wanted, to, march, westward, and, cut, antigonus, s, lines, of, supply, but, the, satraps, refused, to, abandon, their, satrapies, and, forced, eumenes, to, stay, in, the, east, in, the, late, summer, of, 316, bc, antigonus, moved, southward, again, in, the, hope, of, bringing, eumenes, to, battle, and, ending, the, war, quickly, eventually, the, two, armies, in, southern, media, and, fought, in, the, indecisive, battle, of, paraitakene, antigonus, whose, casualties, were, more, numerous, force, marched, his, army, to, safety, the, next, night, during, the, winter, of, 316, 315, bc, antigonus, tried, to, surprise, eumenes, in, persia, by, marching, his, army, across, a, desert, and, catching, his, enemy, off, guard, unfortunately, he, was, observed, by, some, locals, who, reported, it, to, his, opponents, a, few, days, later, both, armies, drew, up, for, battle, the, battle, of, gabiene, was, as, indecisive, as, the, previous, battle, at, parataikene, according, to, plutarch, and, diodorus, eumenes, had, won, the, battle, but, lost, control, of, his, army, s, baggage, camp, thanks, to, his, ally, peucestas, duplicity, or, incompetence, this, baggage, also, included, all, the, loot, of, the, silver, shields, treasure, accumulated, over, 30, years, of, successful, warfare, it, contained, not, only, gold, silver, gems, and, other, booty, but, also, the, soldiers, women, and, children, and, they, wanted, it, back, antigonus, responded, to, a, request, for, the, return, of, the, baggage, train, sent, by, teutamus, one, of, their, commanders, by, demanding, they, give, him, eumenes, the, silver, shields, complied, arrested, eumenes, and, his, officers, and, handed, them, over, the, war, was, thus, at, an, end, eumenes, was, placed, under, guard, while, antigonus, held, a, council, to, pondered, his, fate, antigonus, was, disinclined, to, kill, eumenes, in, this, he, was, backed, up, by, his, son, demetrius, but, most, of, the, council, insisted, he, execute, eumenes, and, so, it, was, decided, as, a, result, antigonus, now, was, in, possession, of, the, empire, s, asian, territories, his, authority, stretching, from, the, eastern, satrapies, to, syria, and, asia, minor, in, the, west, he, seized, the, treasuries, at, susa, and, entered, babylon, the, governor, of, babylon, seleucus, fled, to, ptolemy, and, entered, into, a, league, with, him, lysimachus, and, cassander, in, 314, bc, antigonus, received, envoys, from, the, allied, dynasts, ptolemy, cassander, and, lysimachus, who, demanded, he, cede, cappadocia, and, lycia, to, cassander, hellespontine, phrygia, to, lysimachus, phoenicia, and, syria, to, ptolemy, and, babylonia, to, seleucus, and, that, he, should, share, the, treasure, he, had, accumulated, his, only, answer, was, to, advise, the, dynasts, to, be, ready, for, war, antigonus, sent, aristodemus, with, a, 1, 000, talents, to, the, peloponnesus, to, raise, an, army, there, and, also, to, make, an, alliance, with, his, old, enemy, polyperchon, he, and, polyperchon, were, then, to, make, war, on, cassander, he, sent, an, army, under, his, nephew, polemaeus, through, cappadocia, to, the, hellespont, to, keep, cassander, and, lysimachus, from, invading, asia, minor, he, himself, invaded, phoenicia, which, was, under, ptolemy, s, control, and, besieged, tyre, the, siege, of, tyre, took, a, year, and, after, securing, phoenicia, he, marched, his, main, army, into, asia, minor, intent, on, taking, out, asander, satrap, of, lydia, and, caria, and, ally, to, ptolemy, and, cassander, leaving, the, defence, of, syria, and, phoenicia, to, his, oldest, son, demetrius, in, 312, bc, antigonus, captured, lydia, and, all, of, caria, and, drove, off, asander, he, then, sent, his, nephews, telesphorus, and, polemaeus, against, cassander, in, greece, while, antigonus, was, engaged, in, the, west, ptolemy, took, advantage, of, the, situation, and, invaded, from, the, south, he, met, demetrius, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, gaza, where, ptolemy, won, a, stunning, victory, after, the, battle, seleucus, who, was, fighting, for, ptolemy, made, his, way, back, to, babylonia, and, soon, established, control, over, his, old, satrapy, and, went, on, to, secure, the, eastern, provinces, against, antigonus, seleucus, s, conquest, led, to, the, babylonian, war, during, which, seleucus, defeated, both, demetrius, and, antigonus, and, secured, control, over, the, eastern, provinces, after, the, babylonian, war, which, lasted, from, 311, bc, to, 309, bc, a, peace, was, concluded, between, antigonus, and, seleucus, leaving, them, both, to, consolidate, their, power, in, their, respective, realms, antigonus, in, the, west, and, seleucus, in, the, east, in, the, west, antigonus, had, worn, down, his, enemies, and, forced, a, peace, upon, them, by, this, peace, he, had, attained, the, zenith, of, his, power, antigonus, empire, and, alliance, system, now, comprised, greece, asia, minor, syria, phoenicia, and, northern, mesopotamia, the, peace, agreement, was, soon, violated, by, ptolemy, and, cassander, based, on, the, pretext, that, garrisons, had, been, placed, in, some, of, the, free, greek, cities, by, antigonus, ptolemy, and, cassander, renewed, hostilities, against, antigonus, demetrius, poliorcetes, the, son, of, antigonus, wrested, part, of, greece, from, cassander, in, 306, bc, philip, antigonus, s, youngest, son, died, a, premature, death, aged, about, 26, 28, this, was, a, severe, blow, to, antigonus, who, not, only, lost, a, son, but, also, a, general, who, might, have, been, of, the, greatest, value, to, him, in, the, campaigns, to, come, after, defeating, ptolemy, at, the, naval, battle, of, salamis, in, 306, bc, demetrius, conquered, cyprus, following, that, victory, antigonus, assumed, the, title, of, king, and, bestowed, the, same, upon, his, son, this, was, effectively, a, declaration, by, antigonus, that, he, now, was, independent, from, the, empire, the, other, dynasts, cassander, ptolemy, lysimachus, and, seleucus, soon, followed, antigonus, lead, and, declared, themselves, to, be, kings, antigonus, now, prepared, a, large, army, and, a, formidable, fleet, the, command, of, which, he, gave, to, demetrius, and, hastened, to, attack, ptolemy, in, his, own, dominions, his, invasion, of, egypt, however, proved, a, failure, as, he, was, unable, to, penetrate, ptolemy, s, defences, and, was, obliged, to, retire, although, he, inflicted, heavy, losses, on, ptolemy, in, 305, bc, demetrius, attempted, the, reduction, of, rhodes, which, had, refused, to, assist, antigonus, against, egypt, the, siege, of, rhodes, lasted, a, year, and, ended, in, 304, bc, when, demetrius, meeting, with, obstinate, resistance, was, obliged, to, make, a, peace, treaty, upon, the, terms, that, the, rhodians, would, build, ships, for, antigonus, and, aid, him, against, any, enemy, except, for, ptolemy, on, whom, they, bestowed, the, title, soter, savior, for, his, aid, during, the, lengthy, siege, the, most, powerful, dynasts, of, the, empire, now, kings, in, their, own, right, cassander, seleucus, ptolemy, and, lysimachus, responded, to, antigonus, successes, by, allying, with, each, other, often, through, marriage, antigonus, soon, found, himself, at, war, with, all, four, largely, because, his, territory, shared, borders, with, each, of, them, in, 304, 303, demetrius, had, cassander, in, a, difficult, position, having, gained, the, support, of, the, greeks, and, defeating, cassander, repeatedly, antigonus, demanded, from, cassander, the, unconditional, submission, of, macedonia, seleucus, lysimachus, and, ptolemy, responded, by, joining, forces, and, attacking, him, lysimachus, and, cassander, s, general, prepelaos, invaded, asia, minor, from, thrace, crossing, the, hellespont, lysimachus, had, soon, secured, most, of, the, ionian, cities, meanwhile, seleucus, was, marching, through, mesopotamia, and, cappadocia, antigonus, was, obliged, to, recall, demetrius, from, greece, where, his, son, had, recently, had, an, indecisive, encounter, with, cassander, in, thessaly, now, antigonus, and, demetrius, moved, against, lysimachus, and, prepelaos, however, the, army, of, antigonus, and, demetrius, was, defeated, by, the, united, forces, of, seleucus, lysimachus, and, prepelaos, at, the, decisive, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, antigonus, died, during, the, battle, after, being, struck, by, a, javelin, in, the, eighty, first, year, of, his, life, prior, to, ipsus, he, had, never, lost, a, battle, with, his, death, any, plans, for, reuniting, alexander, s, empire, came, to, an, end, antigonus, kingdom, was, divided, up, with, most, of, his, territories, ending, up, in, the, hands, of, the, new, kingdoms, ruled, by, lysimachus, and, seleucus, the, victors, largely, followed, antigonus, precedent, and, had, themselves, named, as, kings, but, they, did, not, claim, power, over, the, erstwhile, empire, of, alexander, nor, each, other, instead, these, kings, established, a, troubled, and, in, the, end, failed, modus, vivendi, with, each, other, and, accepted, their, kingdoms, as, separate, realms, meanwhile, antigonus, surviving, son, demetrius, took, control, of, macedonia, in, 294, bc, antigonus, descendants, held, this, possession, off, and, on, until, it, was, conquered, by, the, roman, republic, after, the, battle, of, pydna, in, 168, bc, antigonus, father, was, a, nobleman, named, philip, his, mother, s, name, is, unknown, antigonus, had, an, older, brother, named, demetrius, a,

an, exceptionally, large, man, his, son, demetrius, is, described, as, being, of, heroic, stature, meaning, no, doubt, he, was, a, large, man, but, antigonus, was, even, taller, besides, this, huge, physique, he, was, made, even, more, formidable, in, appearance, because, he, was, missing, an, eye, having, lost, it, in, battle, possibly, at, the, siege, of, perinthus, mary, renault, in, her,
