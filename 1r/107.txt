jan, van, eyck, v, n, a, k, van, eyek, dutch, c, before, 1390, 9, july, 1441, was, a, flemish, painter, active, in, bruges, who, was, one, of, the, early, innovators, of, what, became, known, as, early, netherlandish, painting, and, one, of, the, most, significant, representatives, of, early, northern, renaissance, art, according, to, vasari, and, other, art, historians, including, ernst, gombrich, he, invented, oil, painting, though, most, now, regard, that, claim, as, an, oversimplification, the, surviving, records, indicate, that, he, was, born, around, 1380, or, 1390, in, maaseik, then, maaseyck, hence, his, name, limburg, which, is, located, in, present, day, belgium, he, took, employment, in, the, hague, around, 1422, when, he, was, already, a, master, painter, with, workshop, assistants, and, was, employed, as, painter, and, valet, de, chambre, to, john, iii, the, pitiless, ruler, of, the, counties, of, holland, and, hainaut, after, john, s, death, in, 1425, he, was, later, appointed, as, court, painter, to, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, and, worked, in, lille, before, moving, to, bruges, in, 1429, where, he, lived, until, his, death, he, was, highly, regarded, by, philip, and, undertook, a, number, of, diplomatic, visits, abroad, including, to, lisbon, in, 1428, to, explore, the, possibility, of, a, marriage, contract, between, the, duke, and, isabella, of, portugal, about, 20, surviving, paintings, are, confidently, attributed, to, him, as, well, as, the, ghent, altarpiece, and, the, illuminated, miniatures, of, the, turin, milan, hours, all, dated, between, 1432, and, 1439, ten, are, dated, and, signed, with, a, variation, of, his, motto, als, ich, kan, as, i, eyck, can, a, pun, on, his, name, which, he, typically, painted, in, greek, characters, van, eyck, painted, both, secular, and, religious, subject, matter, including, altarpieces, single, panel, religious, figures, and, commissioned, portraits, his, work, includes, single, panels, diptychs, triptychs, and, polyptych, panels, he, was, well, paid, by, philip, who, sought, that, the, painter, was, secure, financially, and, had, artistic, freedom, so, that, he, could, paint, whenever, he, pleased, van, eyck, s, work, comes, from, the, international, gothic, style, but, he, soon, eclipsed, it, in, part, through, a, greater, emphasis, on, naturalism, and, realism, he, achieved, a, new, level, of, virtuosity, through, his, developments, in, the, use, of, oil, paint, he, was, highly, influential, and, his, techniques, and, style, were, adopted, and, refined, by, the, early, netherlandish, painters, little, is, known, of, jan, van, eyck, s, early, life, and, neither, the, date, nor, place, of, his, birth, is, documented, the, first, extant, record, of, his, life, comes, from, the, court, of, john, of, bavaria, at, the, hague, where, between, 1422, and, 1424, payments, were, made, to, meyster, jan, den, malre, master, jan, the, painter, who, was, then, a, court, painter, with, the, rank, of, valet, de, chambre, with, at, first, one, and, then, two, assistants, this, suggests, a, date, of, birth, of, 1395, at, the, latest, however, his, apparent, age, in, the, london, probable, self, portrait, of, 1433, suggests, to, most, scholars, a, date, closer, to, 1380, he, was, identified, in, the, late, 16th, century, as, having, been, born, in, maaseik, a, borough, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, li, ge, his, daughter, lievine, was, in, a, nunnery, in, maaseik, after, her, father, s, death, the, notes, on, his, preparatory, drawing, for, portrait, of, cardinal, niccol, albergati, are, written, in, the, maasland, dialect, he, had, a, sister, margareta, and, at, least, two, brothers, hubert, died, 1426, with, whom, he, probably, served, his, apprenticeship, and, lambert, active, between, 1431, and, 1442, both, also, painters, but, the, order, of, their, births, has, not, been, established, another, significant, and, rather, younger, painter, who, worked, in, southern, france, barth, lemy, van, eyck, is, presumed, to, be, a, relation, it, is, not, known, where, jan, was, educated, but, he, had, knowledge, of, latin, and, used, the, greek, and, hebrew, alphabets, in, his, inscriptions, indicating, that, he, was, schooled, in, the, classics, this, level, of, education, was, rare, among, painters, and, would, have, made, him, more, attractive, to, the, cultivated, philip, van, eyck, served, as, official, to, john, of, bavaria, straubing, ruler, of, holland, hainault, and, zeeland, by, this, time, he, had, assembled, a, small, workshop, and, was, involved, in, redecorating, the, binnenhof, palace, in, the, hague, after, john, s, death, in, 1425, he, moved, to, bruges, and, came, to, the, attention, of, philip, the, good, c, 1425, his, emergence, as, a, collectable, painter, generally, follows, his, appointment, to, philip, s, court, and, from, this, point, his, activity, in, the, court, is, comparatively, well, documented, he, served, as, court, artist, and, diplomat, and, was, a, senior, member, of, the, tournai, painters, guild, on, 18, october, 1427, the, feast, of, st, luke, he, travelled, to, tournai, to, attend, a, banquet, in, his, honour, also, attended, by, robert, campin, and, rogier, van, der, weyden, a, court, salary, freed, him, from, commissioned, work, and, allowed, a, large, degree, of, artistic, freedom, over, the, following, decade, van, eyck, s, reputation, and, technical, ability, grew, mostly, from, his, innovative, approaches, towards, the, handling, and, manipulating, of, oil, paint, unlike, most, of, his, peers, his, reputation, never, diminished, and, he, remained, well, regarded, over, the, following, centuries, his, revolutionary, approach, to, oil, was, such, that, a, myth, perpetuated, by, giorgio, vasari, arose, that, he, had, invented, oil, painting, his, brother, hubert, van, eyck, collaborated, on, jan, s, most, famous, works, the, ghent, altarpiece, generally, art, historians, believe, it, was, begun, c, 1420, by, hubert, and, completed, by, jan, in, 1432, another, brother, lambert, is, mentioned, in, burgundian, court, documents, and, may, have, overseen, his, brother, s, workshop, after, jan, s, death, considered, revolutionary, within, his, lifetime, van, eyck, s, designs, and, methods, were, heavily, copied, and, reproduced, his, motto, one, of, the, first, and, still, most, distinctive, signatures, in, art, history, als, ich, kan, as, i, can, a, pun, on, his, name, first, appeared, in, 1433, on, portrait, of, a, man, in, a, turban, which, can, be, seen, as, indicative, of, his, emerging, self, confidence, at, the, time, the, years, between, 1434, and, 1436, are, generally, considered, his, high, point, when, he, produced, works, including, the, madonna, of, chancellor, rolin, lucca, madonna, and, virgin, and, child, with, canon, van, der, paele, around, 1432, he, married, margaret, who, was, 15, years, younger, at, about, the, same, time, he, bought, a, house, in, bruges, margaret, is, unmentioned, before, he, relocated, when, the, first, of, their, two, children, was, born, in, 1434, very, little, is, known, of, margaret, even, her, maiden, name, is, lost, contemporary, records, refer, to, her, mainly, as, damoiselle, marguerite, she, may, have, been, of, aristocratic, birth, though, from, the, lower, nobility, evidenced, from, her, clothes, in, the, portrait, which, are, fashionable, but, not, of, the, sumptuousness, worn, by, the, bride, in, the, arnolfini, portrait, later, as, the, widow, of, a, renowned, painter, margaret, was, afforded, a, modest, pension, by, the, city, of, bruges, after, jan, s, death, at, least, some, of, this, income, was, invested, in, lottery, van, eyck, undertook, a, number, of, journeys, on, philip, the, duke, of, burgundy, s, behalf, between, 1426, and, 1429, described, in, records, as, secret, commissions, for, which, he, was, paid, multiples, of, his, annual, salary, their, precise, nature, is, still, unknown, but, they, seem, to, involve, his, acting, as, envoy, of, the, court, in, 1426, he, departed, for, certain, distant, lands, possibly, to, the, holy, land, a, theory, given, weight, by, the, topographical, accuracy, of, jerusalem, in, the, three, marys, at, the, tomb, a, painting, completed, by, members, of, his, workshop, c, 1440, a, better, documented, commission, was, the, journey, to, lisbon, along, with, a, group, intended, to, prepare, the, ground, for, the, duke, s, wedding, to, isabella, of, portugal, van, eyck, was, tasked, with, painting, the, bride, so, that, the, duke, could, visualise, her, before, their, marriage, because, portugal, was, ridden, with, plague, their, court, was, itinerant, and, the, dutch, party, met, them, at, the, out, of, the, way, castle, of, avis, van, eyck, spent, nine, months, there, returning, to, the, netherlands, with, isabella, as, a, bride, to, be, the, couple, married, on, christmas, day, of, 1429, the, princess, was, probably, not, particularly, attractive, and, that, is, exactly, how, van, eyck, conveyed, her, in, the, now, lost, portrait, typically, he, showed, his, sitters, as, dignified, yet, did, not, hide, their, imperfections, after, his, return, he, was, preoccupied, with, completing, the, ghent, altarpiece, which, was, consecrated, on, 6, may, 1432, at, saint, bavo, cathedral, during, an, official, ceremony, for, philip, records, from, 1437, say, that, he, was, held, in, high, esteem, by, the, upper, ranks, of, burgundian, nobility, and, was, employed, in, foreign, commissions, jan, van, eyck, died, on, 9, july, 1441, in, bruges, he, was, buried, in, the, graveyard, of, the, church, of, st, donatian, as, a, mark, of, respect, philip, made, a, one, off, payment, to, jan, s, widow, margaret, to, a, value, equal, to, the, artist, s, annual, salary, he, left, behind, many, unfinished, works, to, be, completed, by, his, workshop, journeymen, after, his, death, lambert, van, eyck, ran, the, workshop, as, jan, s, reputation, and, stature, steadily, grew, early, in, 1442, lambert, had, the, body, exhumed, and, placed, inside, st, donatian, s, cathedral, in, 1449, he, was, mentioned, by, the, italian, humanist, and, antiquarian, ciriaco, de, pizzicolli, as, a, painter, of, note, and, ability, and, was, recorded, by, bartolomeo, facio, in, 1456, jan, van, eyck, produced, paintings, for, private, clients, in, addition, to, his, work, at, the, court, foremost, among, these, is, the, ghent, altarpiece, painted, for, the, merchant, financier, and, politician, jodocus, vijdts, and, his, wife, elisabeth, borluut, started, sometime, before, 1426, and, completed, by, 1432, the, polyptych, is, seen, as, representing, the, final, conquest, of, reality, in, the, north, differing, from, the, great, works, of, the, early, renaissance, in, italy, by, virtue, of, its, willingness, to, forgo, classical, idealisation, in, favor, of, the, faithful, observation, of, nature, even, though, it, may, be, assumed, given, the, demand, and, fashion, that, he, produced, a, number, of, triptychs, only, the, dresden, altarpiece, survives, although, a, number, of, extant, portraits, may, be, wings, of, dismantled, polyptychs, telltale, signs, are, hinges, on, original, frames, the, sitter, s, orientation, and, praying, hands, or, the, inclusion, of, iconographical, elements, in, an, otherwise, seemingly, secular, portrait, about, 20, surviving, paintings, are, confidently, attributed, to, him, all, dated, between, 1432, and, 1439, ten, including, the, ghent, altarpiece, are, dated, and, signed, with, a, variation, of, his, motto, als, ich, kan, in, 1998, holland, cotter, estimated, that, only, two, dozen, or, so, paintings, attributed, with, varying, degrees, of, confidence, along, with, some, drawings, and, a, few, pages, from, the, turin, milan, hours, he, described, the, complex, relationship, and, tension, between, art, historians, and, holding, museums, in, assigning, authorship, of, the, 40, or, so, works, considered, originals, in, the, mid, 80s, around, ten, are, now, vigorously, contested, by, leading, researchers, as, workshop, since, 1901, jan, van, eyck, has, often, been, credited, as, the, anonymous, artist, known, as, hand, g, of, the, turin, milan, hours, if, this, is, correct, the, turin, illustrations, are, the, only, known, works, from, his, early, period, according, to, thomas, kren, the, earlier, dates, for, hand, g, precede, any, known, panel, painting, in, an, eyckian, style, which, raise, provocative, questions, about, the, role, that, manuscript, illumination, may, have, played, in, the, vaunted, verisimilitude, of, eyckian, oil, painting, the, evidence, for, attributing, van, eyck, rests, on, part, on, the, fact, that, although, the, figures, are, mostly, of, the, international, gothic, type, they, reappear, in, some, of, his, later, work, in, addition, there, are, coats, of, arms, connected, with, the, wittelsbach, family, with, whom, he, had, connections, in, the, hague, while, some, of, the, figures, in, the, miniatures, echo, the, horsemen, in, the, ghent, altarpiece, most, of, the, turin, milan, hours, were, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1904, and, survive, only, in, photographs, and, copies, only, three, pages, at, most, attributed, to, hand, g, now, survive, those, with, large, miniatures, of, the, birth, of, john, the, baptist, the, finding, of, the, true, cross, and, the, office, of, the, dead, or, requiem, mass, with, the, bas, de, page, miniatures, and, initials, of, the, first, and, last, of, these, the, office, of, the, dead, is, often, seen, as, recalling, jan, s, 1438, 1440, madonna, in, the, church, four, more, were, lost, in, 1904, all, the, elements, of, the, pages, with, the, miniatures, called, the, prayer, on, the, shore, or, duke, william, of, bavaria, at, the, seashore, the, sovereign, s, prayer, etc, and, the, night, scene, of, the, betrayal, of, christ, which, was, already, described, by, durrieu, as, worn, before, the, fire, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, and, its, bas, de, page, and, the, large, picture, only, of, the, seascape, voyage, of, st, julian, st, martha, except, the, ghent, altarpiece, van, eyck, s, religious, works, feature, the, virgin, mary, as, the, central, figure, she, is, typically, seated, wearing, a, jewel, studded, crown, cradling, a, playful, child, christ, who, gazes, at, her, and, grips, the, hem, of, her, dress, in, a, manner, that, recalls, the, 13th, century, byzantine, tradition, of, the, eleusa, icon, virgin, of, tenderness, she, is, sometimes, shown, reading, a, book, of, hours, she, usually, wears, red, in, the, 1432, ghent, altarpiece, mary, wears, a, crown, adorned, with, flowers, and, stars, she, is, dressed, as, a, bride, and, reads, from, a, girdle, book, draped, with, green, cloth, perhaps, an, element, borrowed, from, robert, campin, s, virgin, annunciate, the, panel, contains, a, number, of, motifs, that, later, reappear, in, later, works, she, is, already, queen, of, heaven, wearing, a, crown, adorned, with, flowers, and, stars, van, eyck, usually, presents, mary, as, an, apparition, before, a, donor, kneeling, in, prayer, to, the, side, the, idea, of, a, saint, appearing, before, a, layperson, was, common, in, northern, donor, portraits, of, the, period, in, virgin, and, child, with, canon, van, der, paele, 1434, 1436, the, canon, seems, to, have, just, paused, momentarily, to, reflect, on, a, passage, from, his, hand, held, bible, as, the, virgin, and, child, with, two, saints, appear, before, him, as, if, embodiments, of, his, prayer, mary, s, role, in, his, works, should, be, viewed, in, the, context, of, the, contemporary, cult, and, veneration, surrounding, her, in, the, early, 15th, century, mary, grew, in, importance, as, an, intercessor, between, the, divine, and, members, of, the, christian, faith, the, concept, of, purgatory, as, an, intermediary, state, that, each, soul, had, to, pass, through, before, admission, to, heaven, was, at, its, height, prayer, was, the, most, obvious, means, of, decreasing, time, in, limbo, while, the, wealthy, could, commission, new, churches, extensions, to, existing, ones, or, devotional, portraits, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, trend, towards, the, sponsorship, of, requiem, masses, often, as, part, of, the, terms, of, a, will, a, practice, that, joris, van, der, paele, actively, sponsored, with, this, income, he, endowed, the, churches, with, embroidered, cloths, and, metal, accessories, such, as, chalices, plates, and, candlesticks, eyck, usually, gives, mary, three, roles, mother, of, christ, the, personification, of, the, ecclesia, triumphans, or, queen, of, heaven, the, idea, of, mary, as, a, metaphor, for, the, church, itself, is, especially, strong, in, his, later, paintings, in, madonna, in, the, church, she, dominates, the, cathedral, her, head, is, almost, level, with, the, approximately, sixty, feet, high, gallery, art, historian, otto, p, cht, describes, the, interior, of, the, panel, as, a, throne, room, which, envelops, her, as, if, a, carrying, case, this, distortion, of, scale, is, found, in, a, number, of, other, of, his, madonna, paintings, including, annunciation, her, monumental, stature, borrows, from, the, works, of, 12th, and, 13th, century, italian, artists, such, as, cimabue, and, giotto, who, in, turn, reflect, a, tradition, reaching, back, to, an, italo, byzantine, type, and, emphasises, her, identification, with, the, cathedral, itself, art, historians, in, the, 19th, century, thought, the, work, was, executed, early, in, van, eyck, s, career, and, attributed, her, scale, as, the, mistake, of, a, relatively, immature, painter, the, idea, that, her, size, represents, her, embodiment, as, the, church, was, first, suggested, by, erwin, panofsky, in, 1941, till, holger, borchert, says, that, van, eyck, did, not, paint, the, madonna, in, a, church, but, as, the, church, van, eyck, s, later, works, contain, very, precise, and, detailed, architectural, details, but, are, not, modeled, on, actual, historical, buildings, he, probably, sought, to, create, an, ideal, and, perfect, space, for, mary, s, apparition, and, was, more, concerned, with, their, visual, impact, rather, than, physical, possibility, the, marian, paintings, are, characterized, by, complex, depictions, of, both, physical, space, and, light, sources, many, of, van, eyck, s, religious, works, contain, a, reduced, interior, space, that, is, nonetheless, subtly, managed, and, arranged, to, convey, a, sense, of, intimacy, without, feeling, constricted, the, madonna, of, chancellor, rolin, is, lit, from, both, the, central, portico, and, the, side, windows, while, the, floor, tiles, in, comparison, to, other, elements, shows, that, the, figures, are, only, about, six, feet, from, the, columned, loggia, screen, and, that, rolin, might, have, had, to, squeeze, himself, through, the, opening, to, get, out, that, way, the, different, elements, of, the, cathedral, in, madonna, in, the, church, are, so, specifically, detailed, and, the, elements, of, gothic, and, contemporary, architecture, so, well, delineated, that, many, art, and, architecture, historians, have, concluded, that, he, must, have, had, enough, architectural, knowledge, to, make, nuanced, distinctions, given, the, accuracy, of, the, descriptions, many, scholars, have, tried, to, link, the, painting, with, particular, buildings, but, in, all, the, buildings, in, van, eyck, s, work, the, structure, is, imagined, and, probably, an, idealized, formation, of, what, he, viewed, as, a, perfect, architectural, space, this, can, be, seen, from, the, many, examples, of, features, that, would, be, unlikely, in, a, contemporary, church, including, the, placing, of, a, round, arched, triforium, above, a, pointed, colonnade, in, the, berlin, work, the, marian, works, are, heavily, lined, with, inscriptions, the, lettering, on, the, arched, throne, above, mary, in, the, ghent, altarpiece, is, taken, from, a, passage, from, the, book, of, wisdom, 7, 29, she, is, more, beautiful, than, the, sun, and, the, army, of, the, stars, compared, to, the, light, she, is, superior, she, is, truly, the, reflection, of, eternal, light, and, a, spotless, mirror, of, god, wording, from, the, same, source, on, the, hem, of, her, robe, on, the, frame, of, madonna, in, the, church, and, on, her, dress, in, virgin, and, child, with, canon, van, der, paele, reads, est, enim, haec, speciosior, sole, et, super, omnem, stellarum, dispositionem, luci, conparata, invenitur, prior, although, inscriptions, are, present, in, all, of, van, eyck, s, paintings, they, are, predominant, in, his, marian, paintings, where, they, seem, to, serve, a, number, of, functions, they, breathe, life, into, portraits, and, give, voice, to, those, venerating, mary, but, also, play, a, functional, role, given, that, contemporary, religious, works, were, commissioned, for, private, devotion, the, inscriptions, may, have, been, intended, to, be, read, as, an, incantation, or, personalized, indulgence, prayers, harbison, notes, that, van, eyck, s, privately, commissioned, works, are, unusually, heavily, inscribed, with, prayer, and, that, the, words, may, have, served, a, similar, function, to, prayer, tablets, or, more, properly, prayer, wings, as, seen, in, the, london, virgin, and, child, triptych, van, eyck, was, highly, sought, after, as, a, portrait, artist, growing, affluence, across, northern, europe, meant, that, portraiture, was, no, longer, the, preserve, of, royalty, or, the, high, aristocracy, an, emerging, merchant, middle, class, and, growing, awareness, of, humanist, ideas, of, individual, identity, led, to, a, demand, for, portraits, van, eyck, s, portraits, are, characterized, by, his, manipulation, of, oil, paint, and, meticulous, attention, to, detail, his, keen, powers, of, observation, and, his, tendency, to, apply, layers, of, thin, translucent, glazes, to, create, intensity, of, color, and, tone, he, pioneered, portraiture, during, the, 1430s, and, was, admired, as, far, away, as, italy, for, the, naturalness, of, his, depictions, today, nine, three, quarters, view, portraits, are, attributed, to, him, his, style, was, widely, adopted, most, notably, by, van, der, weyden, petrus, christus, and, hans, memling, the, small, portrait, of, a, man, with, a, blue, chaperon, of, c, 1430, is, his, earliest, surviving, portrait, it, evidences, many, of, the, elements, that, were, to, become, standard, in, his, portraiture, style, including, the, three, quarters, view, a, type, he, revived, from, antiquity, which, soon, spread, across, europe, directional, lighting, elaborate, headdress, and, for, the, single, portraits, the, framing, of, the, figure, within, an, undefined, narrow, space, set, against, a, flat, black, background, it, is, noted, for, its, realism, and, acute, observation, of, the, small, details, of, the, sitter, s, appearance, the, man, has, a, light, beard, of, one, or, two, days, growth, a, reoccurring, feature, in, van, eyck, s, early, male, portraits, where, the, sitter, is, often, either, unshaven, or, according, to, lorne, campbell, rather, inefficiently, shaved, campbell, lists, other, van, eyck, unshaven, sitters, niccol, albergati, 1431, jodocus, vijdt, 1432, jan, van, eyck, 1433, joris, van, der, paele, c, 1434, 1436, nicolas, rolin, 1435, and, jan, de, leeuw, 1436, notes, made, on, the, reverse, of, his, paper, study, for, the, portrait, of, cardinal, niccol, albergati, provide, insight, into, eyck, s, approach, to, minute, detailing, of, his, sitter, faces, of, his, detailing, of, beard, growth, he, wrote, die, stoppelen, vanden, barde, wal, grijsachtig, the, stubble, of, the, beard, grizzled, on, the, other, aspects, of, his, attempts, to, record, the, old, man, s, face, he, noted, the, iris, of, the, eye, near, the, back, of, the, pupil, brownish, yellow, on, the, contours, next, to, the, white, bluish, the, white, also, yellowish, the, l, al, souvenir, portrait, of, 1432, continues, the, adherence, to, realism, and, acute, observation, of, the, small, details, of, the, sitter, s, appearance, however, by, his, later, works, the, sitter, placed, at, more, of, a, distance, and, the, attention, to, detail, less, marked, the, descriptions, are, less, forensic, more, of, an, overview, while, the, forms, are, broader, and, flatter, even, in, his, early, works, his, descriptions, of, the, model, are, not, faithful, reproductions, parts, of, the, sitters, face, or, form, were, altered, to, either, present, a, better, composition, or, fit, an, ideal, he, often, altered, the, relative, proportions, of, his, models, head, and, body, to, focus, on, the, elements, of, their, features, that, interested, him, this, led, him, to, distort, reality, in, this, paintings, in, the, portrait, of, his, wife, he, altered, the, angle, of, her, nose, and, gave, her, a, fashionably, high, forehead, that, nature, had, not, the, stone, parapet, at, the, base, of, the, canvas, of, l, al, souvenir, is, painted, as, if, to, simulate, marked, or, scarred, stone, and, contains, three, separate, layers, of, inscriptions, each, rendered, in, an, illusionistic, manner, giving, the, impression, they, are, chiseled, onto, stone, van, eyck, often, set, the, inscriptions, as, if, in, the, sitters, voice, so, that, they, appear, to, be, speaking, examples, include, the, portrait, of, jan, de, leeuw, which, reads, jan, de, who, first, opened, his, eyes, on, the, feast, of, st, ursula, 1401, now, jan, van, eyck, has, painted, me, you, can, see, when, he, began, it, 1436, in, portrait, of, margaret, van, eyck, of, 1439, the, lettering, acclaims, my, husband, johannes, completed, me, in, the, year, 1439, on, 17, june, at, the, age, of, 33, as, i, can, hands, play, a, special, significance, in, van, eyck, s, painting, in, his, early, portraits, the, sitters, are, often, shown, holding, objects, indicative, of, their, profession, the, man, in, l, al, souvenir, may, have, been, a, legal, professional, as, he, holds, a, scroll, resembling, a, legal, document, the, arnolfini, portrait, of, 1432, is, filled, with, illusionism, and, symbolism, as, is, the, 1435, madonna, of, chancellor, rolin, commissioned, to, display, rolin, s, power, influence, and, piety, van, eyck, incorporated, a, wide, variety, of, iconographic, elements, often, conveying, what, he, saw, as, a, co, existence, of, the, spiritual, and, material, worlds, the, iconography, was, embedded, in, the, work, unobtrusively, typically, the, references, comprised, small, but, key, background, details, his, use, of, symbolism, and, biblical, references, is, characteristic, of, his, work, a, handling, of, religious, iconography, he, pioneered, with, his, innovations, taken, up, and, developed, by, van, der, weyden, memling, and, christus, each, employed, rich, and, complex, iconographical, elements, to, create, a, heightened, sense, of, contemporary, beliefs, and, spiritual, ideals, craig, harbison, describes, the, blending, of, realism, and, symbolism, as, perhaps, the, most, important, aspect, of, early, flemish, art, the, embedded, symbols, were, meant, to, meld, into, the, scenes, and, was, a, deliberate, strategy, to, create, an, experience, of, spiritual, revelation, van, eyck, s, religious, paintings, in, particular, always, present, the, spectator, with, a, transfigured, view, of, visible, reality, to, him, the, day, to, day, is, harmoniously, steeped, in, symbolism, such, that, according, to, harbison, descriptive, data, were, rearranged, so, that, they, illustrated, not, earthly, existence, but, what, he, considered, supernatural, truth, this, blend, of, the, earthly, and, heavenly, evidences, van, eyck, s, belief, that, the, essential, truth, of, christian, doctrine, can, be, found, in, the, marriage, of, secular, and, sacred, worlds, of, reality, and, symbol, he, depicts, overly, large, madonnas, whose, unrealistic, size, shows, the, separation, between, the, heavenly, from, earthly, but, placed, them, in, everyday, settings, such, as, churches, domestic, chambers, or, seated, with, court, officials, yet, the, earthly, churches, are, heavily, decorated, with, heavenly, symbols, a, heavenly, throne, is, clearly, represented, in, some, domestic, chambers, for, example, in, the, lucca, madonna, more, difficult, to, discern, are, the, settings, for, paintings, such, as, madonna, of, chancellor, rolin, where, the, location, is, a, fusion, of, the, earthly, and, celestial, van, eyck, s, iconography, is, often, so, densely, and, intricately, layered, that, a, work, has, to, be, viewed, multiple, times, before, even, the, most, obvious, meaning, of, an, element, is, apparent, the, symbols, were, often, subtly, woven, into, the, paintings, so, that, they, only, became, apparent, after, close, and, repeated, viewing, while, much, of, the, iconography, reflects, the, idea, that, according, to, john, ward, there, is, a, promised, passage, from, sin, and, death, to, salvation, and, rebirth, van, eyck, was, the, only, 15th, century, netherlandish, painter, to, sign, his, panels, his, motto, always, contained, variants, of, the, words, als, ich, kan, or, a, variant, as, i, can, or, as, best, i, can, which, forms, a, pun, on, his, name, the, aspirated, ich, instead, of, the, brabantian, ik, is, derived, from, his, native, limburgish, the, signature, is, sometimes, inscribed, using, greek, lettering, such, as, aae, ixh, xan, the, word, kan, derives, from, the, middle, dutch, word, kunnen, related, to, the, dutch, word, kunst, or, to, the, german, kunst, art, the, words, may, be, related, to, a, type, of, formula, of, modesty, sometimes, seen, in, medieval, literature, where, the, writer, prefaces, his, work, with, an, apology, for, a, lack, of, perfection, although, given, the, typical, lavishness, of, the, signatures, and, mottos, it, may, merely, be, a, playful, reference, indeed, his, motto, is, sometimes, recorded, in, a, manner, intended, to, mimic, christ, s, monogram, ihc, xpc, for, example, in, his, c, 1440, portrait, of, christ, further, as, the, signature, is, often, a, variant, of, i, jan, van, eyck, was, here, it, can, be, seen, as, a, perhaps, somewhat, arrogant, assertion, of, both, the, faithfulness, and, trustworthiness, of, the, record, and, the, quality, of, the, work, as, i, k, can, the, habit, of, signing, his, work, ensured, that, his, reputation, survived, and, attribution, has, not, been, as, difficult, and, uncertain, as, with, other, first, generation, artists, of, the, early, netherlandish, school, the, signatures, are, usually, completed, in, a, decorative, script, often, of, a, kind, reserved, for, legal, documents, as, can, be, seen, in, l, al, souvenir, and, the, arnolfini, portrait, the, latter, of, which, is, signed, johannes, de, eyck, fuit, hic, 1434, jan, van, eyck, was, here, 1434, a, way, of, recording, his, presence, many, of, van, eyck, s, paintings, are, heavily, inscribed, in, lettering, of, greek, latin, or, vernacular, dutch, campbell, sees, in, many, examples, a, certain, consistency, which, suggest, that, he, himself, had, painted, them, rather, than, they, are, later, additions, the, letterings, seem, to, serve, different, functions, depending, on, the, type, of, work, on, which, they, appear, in, his, single, panel, portraits, they, give, voice, to, the, sitter, most, notably, in, portrait, of, margaret, van, eyck, where, the, greek, lettering, on, the, frame, translates, as, my, husband, johannes, completed, me, in, the, year, 1439, on, 17, june, at, the, age, of, 33, as, i, can, by, contrast, the, inscriptions, on, his, public, formal, religious, commissions, are, written, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, patron, and, there, to, underscore, his, piousness, charity, and, dedication, to, the, saint, who, he, is, shown, accompanying, this, can, be, seen, in, his, virgin, and, child, with, canon, van, der, paele, reads, an, inscription, on, the, lower, imitation, frame, refers, to, the, donation, joris, van, der, paele, canon, of, this, church, had, this, work, made, by, painter, jan, van, eyck, and, he, founded, two, chaplaincies, here, in, the, choir, of, the, lord, 1434, he, only, completed, it, in, 1436, however, exceptionally, for, his, time, van, eyck, often, signed, and, dated, his, frames, then, considered, an, integral, part, of, the, work, the, two, were, often, painted, together, and, while, the, frames, were, constructed, by, a, body, of, craftsmen, separate, to, the, master, s, workshop, their, work, was, often, considered, as, equal, in, skill, to, that, of, the, painter, he, designed, and, painted, the, frames, for, his, single, head, portraits, to, look, like, imitation, stone, with, the, signature, or, other, inscriptions, giving, the, impression, that, they, had, been, chiseled, into, the, stone, the, frames, serve, other, illusionistic, purposes, in, portrait, of, isabella, of, portugal, described, by, the, frame, her, eyes, gaze, coyly, but, directly, out, of, the, painting, as, she, rests, her, hands, on, the, edge, of, a, faux, stone, parapet, with, this, gesture, isabella, extends, her, presence, out, of, the, pictorial, space, and, into, that, of, the, viewer, many, of, the, original, frames, are, lost, and, known, only, through, copies, or, inventory, records, the, london, portrait, of, a, man, was, likely, half, of, a, double, portrait, or, pendant, the, last, record, of, the, original, frames, contained, many, inscriptions, but, not, all, were, original, the, frames, were, often, overpainted, by, later, artists, portrait, of, jan, de, leeuw, also, bears, its, original, frame, which, is, painted, over, to, look, like, bronze, many, of, his, frames, are, heavily, inscribed, which, serves, a, dual, purpose, they, are, decorative, but, also, function, to, set, the, context, for, the, significance, of, the, imagery, similar, to, the, function, of, margins, in, medieval, manuscripts, pieces, such, as, the, dresden, triptych, were, usually, commissioned, for, private, devotion, and, van, eyck, would, have, expected, the, viewer, to, contemplate, text, and, imagery, in, unison, the, interior, panels, of, the, small, 1437, dresden, triptych, are, outlined, with, two, layers, of, painted, bronze, frames, inscribed, with, mostly, latin, lettering, the, texts, are, drawn, from, a, variety, of, sources, in, the, central, frames, from, biblical, descriptions, of, the, assumption, while, the, inner, wings, are, lined, with, fragments, of, prayers, dedicated, to, saints, michael, and, catherine, members, of, his, workshop, completed, works, based, on, his, designs, in, the, years, after, his, death, in, the, summer, of, 1441, this, was, not, unusual, the, widow, of, a, master, would, often, carry, on, the, business, after, his, death, it, is, thought, that, either, his, wife, margaret, or, brother, lambert, took, over, after, 1441, such, works, include, the, ince, hall, madonna, saint, jerome, in, his, study, a, madonna, of, jan, vos, virgin, and, child, with, st, barbara, and, elizabeth, c, 1443, and, others, a, number, of, designs, were, reproduced, by, second, generation, netherlandish, artists, of, the, first, rank, including, petrus, christus, who, painted, a, version, of, the, exeter, madonna, members, of, his, workshop, also, finished, incomplete, paintings, after, his, death, the, upper, portions, of, the, right, hand, panel, of, the, crucifixion, and, last, judgement, diptych, are, generally, considered, the, work, of, a, weaker, painter, with, a, less, individual, style, it, is, thought, that, van, eyck, died, leaving, the, panel, unfinished, but, with, completed, underdrawings, and, the, upper, area, was, finished, by, workshop, members, or, followers, there, are, three, works, confidently, attributed, to, him, but, known, only, from, copies, portrait, of, isabella, of, portugal, dates, to, his, 1428, visit, to, portugal, for, philip, to, draw, up, a, preliminary, marriage, agreement, with, the, daughter, of, john, i, of, portugal, from, surviving, copies, it, can, be, deduced, that, there, were, two, other, painted, on, frames, apart, from, the, actual, oak, frame, one, of, which, was, lettered, with, gothic, inscription, to, the, top, while, a, faux, stone, parapet, provided, support, for, her, hands, to, rest, upon, two, extant, copies, of, his, woman, bathing, were, made, in, the, 60, years, after, his, death, but, it, is, known, mostly, through, its, appearance, in, willem, van, haecht, s, expansive, 1628, painting, the, gallery, of, cornelis, van, der, geest, a, view, of, a, collector, s, gallery, containing, many, other, identifiable, old, masters, woman, bathing, bears, many, similarities, to, arnolfini, portrait, including, an, interior, with, a, bed, and, a, small, dog, a, mirror, and, its, reflection, a, chest, of, drawers, and, clogs, on, the, floor, more, broadly, similar, are, the, attendant, woman, s, dress, the, outline, of, her, figure, and, the, angle, from, which, she, faces, in, the, earliest, significant, source, on, van, eyck, a, 1454, biography, in, genoese, humanist, bartolomeo, facio, s, de, viris, illustribus, jan, van, eyck, is, named, the, leading, painter, of, his, day, facio, places, him, among, the, best, artists, of, the, early, 15th, century, along, with, rogier, van, der, weyden, gentile, da, fabriano, and, pisanello, it, is, particularly, interesting, that, facio, shows, as, much, enthusiasm, for, netherlandish, painters, as, he, does, for, italian, painters, this, text, sheds, light, on, aspects, of, jan, van, eyck, s, production, now, lost, citing, a, bathing, scene, owned, by, a, prominent, italian, but, mistakenly, attributing, to, van, eyck, a, world, map, painted, by, another, jan, van, eyckplein, in, bruges, is, named, for, him
