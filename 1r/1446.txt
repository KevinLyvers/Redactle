president, between, 21, and, 24, september, yeltsin, was, confronted, by, popular, unrest, demonstrators, protested, the, terrible, living, conditions, under, yeltsin, since, 1989, gdp, had, declined, by, half, corruption, was, rampant, violent, crime, was, skyrocketing, medical, services, were, collapsing, food, and, fuel, were, increasingly, scarce, and, life, expectancy, was, falling, for, all, but, a, tiny, handful, of, the, population, moreover, yeltsin, was, increasingly, getting, the, blame, by, early, october, yeltsin, had, secured, the, support, of, russia, s, army, and, ministry, of, interior, forces, in, a, massive, show, of, force, yeltsin, called, up, tanks, to, shell, the, russian, white, house, parliament, building, the, attack, killed, 187, people, and, wounded, almost, 500,

economic, policies, were, overwhelmed, by, a, huge, anti, yeltsin, vote, the, bulk, of, which, was, divided, between, the, communist, party, and, ultra, nationalists, however, the, referendum, held, at, the, same, time, approved, the, new, constitution, which, significantly, expanded, the, powers, of, the, president, giving, yeltsin, the, right, to, appoint, the, members, of, the, government, to, dismiss, the, prime, minister, and, in, some, cases, to, dissolve, the, duma, this, led, to, the, de, facto, establishment, of, a, super, presidential, system, the, us, department, of, state, seemed, to, confuse, yeltsin, over, german, re, unification, and, dismemberment, of, the, helsinki, final, act, and, ensuing, partnership, for, peace, pfp, push, for, nato, expansion, there, is, some, question, as, to, the, involvement, of, his, minister, of, foreign, affairs, andrei, kozyrev, who, in, august, 1993, was, painted, by, lech, wa, sa, as, a, saboteur, of, polish, aspirations, for, nato, membership, but, was, regarded, by, domestic, opponents, as, suborned, by, the, united, states, in, yeltsin, s, letter, to, bill, clinton, dated, 15, september, 1993, he, strongly, favored, a, pan, european, security, system, instead, of, nato, and, warned, not, only, the, opposition, but, moderate, circles, as, well, would, no, doubt, perceive, this, as, a, sort, of, neo, isolation, of, our, country, in, diametric, opposition, to, its, natural, admission, into, euro, atlantic, space, after, his, august, visit, to, warsaw, yeltsin, saw, the, explosion, of, fright, over, nato, in, the, old, guard, and, thereafter, the, window, of, d, tente, slammed, shut, by, december, 1994, the, month, in, which, the, budapest, memorandum, was, signed, clinton, began, to, understand, that, russia, had, concluded, he, was, subordinating, if, not, abandoning, integration, to, nato, expansion, in, july, 1995, by, which, time, the, russians, had, signed, up, to, pfp, yeltsin, said, to, clinton, we, must, stick, to, our, position, which, is, that, there, should, be, no, rapid, expansion, of, nato, it, s, important, that, the, osce, be, the, principal, mechanism, for, developing, a, new, security, order, in, europe, nato, is, a, factor, too, of, course, but, nato, should, evolve, into, a, political, organization, in, december, 1994, yeltsin, ordered, the, military, invasion, of, chechnya, in, an, attempt, to, restore, moscow, s, control, over, the, republic, nearly, two, years, later, yeltsin, withdrew, federal, forces, from, the, devastated, chechnya, under, a, 1996, peace, agreement, brokered, by, alexander, lebed, yeltsin, s, then, security, chief, the, peace, deal, allowed, chechnya, greater, autonomy, but, not, full, independence, the, decision, to, launch, the, war, in, chechnya, dismayed, many, in, the, west, time, magazine, wrote, then, what, was, to, be, made, of, boris, yeltsin, clearly, he, could, no, longer, be, regarded, as, the, democratic, hero, of, western, myth, but, had, he, become, an, old, style, communist, boss, turning, his, back, on, the, democratic, reformers, he, once, championed, and, throwing, in, his, lot, with, militarists, and, ultranationalists, or, was, he, a, befuddled, out, of, touch, chief, being, manipulated, knowingly, or, unwittingly, by, well, by, whom, exactly, if, there, was, to, be, a, dictatorial, coup, would, yeltsin, be, its, victim, or, its, leader, in, 1995, a, black, brant, sounding, rocket, launched, from, the, and, ya, space, center, caused, a, high, alert, in, russia, known, as, the, norwegian, rocket, incident, the, russians, were, alerted, that, it, might, be, a, nuclear, missile, launched, from, an, american, submarine, the, incident, occurred, in, the, post, cold, war, era, where, many, russians, were, still, very, suspicious, of, the, united, states, and, nato, a, full, alert, was, passed, up, through, the, military, chain, of, command, all, the, way, to, yeltsin, who, was, notified, and, the, nuclear, briefcase, known, in, russia, as, cheget, used, to, authorize, nuclear, launch, was, automatically, activated, russian, satellites, indicated, that, no, massive, attack, was, underway, and, he, agreed, with, advisors, that, it, was, a, false, alarm, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, yeltsin, promoted, privatization, as, a, way, of, spreading, ownership, of, shares, in, former, state, enterprises, as, widely, as, possible, to, create, political, support, for, his, economic, reforms, in, the, west, privatization, was, viewed, as, the, key, to, the, transition, from, communism, in, eastern, europe, ensuring, a, quick, dismantling, of, the, soviet, era, command, economy, to, make, way, for, free, market, reforms, in, the, early, 1990s, anatoly, chubais, yeltsin, s, deputy, for, economic, policy, emerged, as, a, leading, advocate, of, privatization, in, russia, in, late, 1992, yeltsin, launched, a, programme, of, free, vouchers, as, a, way, to, give, mass, privatization, a, jump, start, under, the, programme, all, russian, citizens, were, issued, vouchers, each, with, a, nominal, value, of, around, 10, 000, rubles, for, the, purchase, of, shares, of, select, state, enterprises, although, each, citizen, initially, received, a, voucher, of, equal, face, value, within, months, the, majority, of, them, converged, in, the, hands, of, intermediaries, who, were, ready, to, buy, them, for, cash, right, away, in, 1995, as, yeltsin, struggled, to, finance, russia, s, growing, foreign, debt, and, gain, support, from, the, russian, business, elite, for, his, bid, in, the, 1996, presidential, elections, the, russian, president, prepared, for, a, new, wave, of, privatization, offering, stock, shares, in, some, of, russia, s, most, valuable, state, enterprises, in, exchange, for, bank, loans, the, programme, was, promoted, as, a, way, of, simultaneously, speeding, up, privatization, and, ensuring, the, government, a, cash, infusion, to, cover, its, operating, needs, however, the, deals, were, effectively, giveaways, of, valuable, state, assets, to, a, small, group, of, tycoons, in, finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and, the, media, who, came, to, be, known, as, oligarchs, in, the, mid, 1990s, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, ordinary, people, sold, their, vouchers, for, cash, the, vouchers, were, bought, by, a, small, group, of, investors, by, mid, 1996, substantial, ownership, shares, over, major, firms, were, acquired, at, very, low, prices, by, a, handful, of, people, boris, berezovsky, who, controlled, major, stakes, in, several, banks, and, the, national, media, emerged, as, one, of, yeltsin, s, most, prominent, supporters, along, with, berezovsky, mikhail, khodorkovsky, vladimir, potanin, vladimir, bogdanov, rem, viakhirev, vagit, alekperov, alexander, smolensky, viktor, vekselberg, mikhail, fridman, and, a, few, years, later, roman, abramovich, were, habitually, mentioned, in, the, media, as, russia, s, oligarchs, on, 5, december, 1991, senator, jesse, helms, ranking, member, of, the, minority, on, the, u, s, senate, committee, on, foreign, relations, wrote, to, yeltsin, concerning, u, s, servicemen, who, were, pows, or, mias, the, status, of, thousands, and, thousands, of, american, servicemen, who, are, held, by, soviet, and, other, communist, forces, and, who, were, never, repatriated, after, every, major, war, this, century, is, of, grave, concern, to, the, american, people, yeltsin, responded, with, a, statement, made, on, 15, june, 1992, whilst, being, interviewed, on, board, his, presidential, jet, en, route, to, the, united, states, our, archives, have, shown, that, it, is, true, some, of, them, were, transferred, to, the, territory, of, the, ussr, and, were, kept, in, labour, camps, we, can, only, surmise, that, some, of, them, may, still, be, alive, on, 10, december, 1991, five, days, after, helms, had, written, to, yeltsin, regarding, american, servicemen, he, again, wrote, to, yeltsin, this, time, concerning, korean, air, lines, flight, 007, kal, 007, requesting, information, concerning, possible, survivors, including, georgia, congressman, larry, mcdonald, and, their, whereabouts, one, of, the, greatest, tragedies, of, the, cold, war, was, the, shoot, down, of, the, korean, airlines, flight, 007, by, the, armed, forces, of, what, was, then, the, soviet, union, on, 1, september, 1983, the, kal, 007, tragedy, was, one, of, the, most, tense, incidences, of, the, entire, cold, war, however, now, that, relations, between, our, two, nations, have, improved, substantially, i, believe, that, it, is, time, to, resolve, the, mysteries, surrounding, this, event, clearing, the, air, on, this, issue, could, help, further, to, improve, relations, in, march, 1992, yeltsin, handed, over, kal, 007, s, black, box, without, its, tapes, to, south, korean, president, roh, tae, woo, at, the, end, of, the, plenary, session, of, the, south, korean, national, assembly, saying, we, apologize, for, the, tragedy, and, are, trying, to, settle, some, unsolved, issues, yeltsin, released, the, tapes, of, the, kal, 007, s, black, box, its, digital, flight, data, recorder, and, cockpit, voice, recorder, to, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, on, 8, january, 1993, for, years, the, soviet, authorities, had, denied, possessing, these, tapes, the, openness, of, yeltsin, about, pow, mia, and, kal, 007, matters, may, also, have, signalled, his, willingness, for, more, openness, to, the, west, in, 1992, which, he, labelled, the, window, of, opportunity, he, was, willing, to, discuss, biological, weapons, with, the, united, states, and, admitted, that, the, sverdlovsk, anthrax, leak, of, 2, april, 1979, which, yeltsin, had, originally, been, involved, in, concealing, had, been, caused, as, the, result, of, a, mishap, at, a, military, facility, the, russian, government, had, maintained, that, the, cause, was, contaminated, meat, the, true, number, of, victims, in, the, anthrax, outbreak, at, sverdlovsk, about, 850, miles, 1, 368, km, east, of, moscow, is, unknown, in, february, 1996, yeltsin, announced, that, he, would, seek, a, second, term, in, the, 1996, russian, presidential, election, in, the, summer, the, announcement, followed, weeks, of, speculation, that, yeltsin, was, at, the, end, of, his, political, career, because, of, his, health, problems, and, growing, unpopularity, in, russia, at, the, time, yeltsin, was, recuperating, from, a, series, of, heart, attacks, domestic, and, international, observers, also, noted, his, occasionally, erratic, behavior, when, campaigning, began, in, early, 1996, yeltsin, s, popularity, was, close, to, being, non, existent, meanwhile, the, opposition, communist, party, had, already, gained, ground, in, parliamentary, voting, on, 17, december, 1995, and, its, candidate, gennady, zyuganov,

with, inner, complexities, who, exhibited, both, a, mathematical, cast, of, mind, and, a, taste, for, adventure, noting, that, yeltsin, had, the, intuition, for, grasping, a, situation, holistically, colton, thought, yeltsin, could, be, bullheaded, and, restless, evans, noted, that, in, yeltsin, s, autobiography, the, leader, appeared, to, view, himself, as, more, of, a, soviet, person, than, a,

and, branson, noted, that, yeltsin, was, a, hero, for, young, russians, a, cult, figure, to, those, who, were, not, necessarily, anticommunists, but, who, were, filled, with, bitterness, and, apathy, from, the, brezhnev, years, they, noted, he, was, ebullient, almost, outrageously, open, and, also, charismatic, they, added, that, yeltsin, presented, himself, as, a, true, working, class, hero,

characterised, him, as, russia, s, first, modern, leader, colton, understood, him, as, a, hero, in, history, albeit, one, who, was, enigmatic, and, flawed, he, expressed, the, view, that, yeltsin, was, part, of, the, global, trend, away, from, authoritarianism, and, statism, that, occurred, in, the, 1990s, comparing, him, to, nelson, mandela, lech, wa, sa, v, clav, havel, and, mikhail,
