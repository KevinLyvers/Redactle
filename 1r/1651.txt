wolfgang, ernst, pauli, p, l, i, german, 25, april, 1900, 15, december, 1958, was, an, austrian, theoretical, physicist, and, one, of, the, pioneers, of, quantum, physics, in, 1945, after, having, been, nominated, by, albert, einstein, pauli, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, decisive, contribution, through, his, discovery, of, a, new, law, of, nature, the, exclusion, principle, or, pauli, principle, the, discovery, involved, spin, theory, which, is, the, basis, of, a, theory, of, the, structure, of, matter, pauli, was, born, in, vienna, to, a, chemist, wolfgang, joseph, pauli, n, wolf, pascheles, 1869, 1955, and, his, wife, bertha, camilla, sch, tz, his, sister, was, hertha, pauli, a, writer, and, actress, pauli, s, middle, name, was, given, in, honor, of, his, godfather, physicist, ernst, mach, pauli, s, paternal, grandparents, were, from, prominent, jewish, families, of, prague, his, great, grandfather, was, the, jewish, publisher, wolf, pascheles, pauli, s, mother, bertha, sch, tz, was, raised, in, her, mother, s, roman, catholic, religion, her, father, was, jewish, writer, friedrich, sch, tz, pauli, was, raised, as, a, roman, catholic, pauli, attended, the, d, blinger, gymnasium, in, vienna, graduating, with, distinction, in, 1918, two, months, later, he, published, his, first, paper, on, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, he, attended, the, university, of, munich, working, under, arnold, sommerfeld, where, he, received, his, phd, in, july, 1921, for, his, thesis, on, the, quantum, theory, of, ionized, diatomic, hydrogen, h, 2, sommerfeld, asked, pauli, to, review, the, theory, of, relativity, for, the, encyklop, die, der, mathematischen, wissenschaften, encyclopedia, of, mathematical, sciences, two, months, after, receiving, his, doctorate, pauli, completed, the, article, which, came, to, 237, pages, einstein, praised, it, published, as, a, monograph, it, remains, a, standard, reference, on, the, subject, pauli, spent, a, year, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, as, the, assistant, to, max, born, and, the, next, year, at, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, in, copenhagen, later, the, niels, bohr, institute, from, 1923, to, 1928, he, was, a, professor, at, the, university, of, hamburg, during, this, period, pauli, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, the, modern, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, in, particular, he, formulated, the, exclusion, principle, and, the, theory, of, nonrelativistic, spin, in, 1928, pauli, was, appointed, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, eth, zurich, in, switzerland, he, was, awarded, the, lorentz, medal, in, 1930, he, held, visiting, professorships, at, the, university, of, michigan, in, 1931, and, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, in, 1935, at, the, end, of, 1930, shortly, after, his, postulation, of, the, neutrino, and, immediately, after, his, divorce, and, his, mother, s, suicide, pauli, experienced, a, personal, crisis, in, january, 1932, he, consulted, psychiatrist, and, psychotherapist, carl, jung, who, also, lived, near, z, rich, jung, immediately, began, interpreting, pauli, s, deeply, archetypal, dreams, and, pauli, became, a, collaborator, of, jung, s, he, soon, began, to, critique, the, epistemology, of, jung, s, theory, scientifically, and, this, contributed, to, a, certain, clarification, of, jung, s, ideas, especially, about, synchronicity, a, great, many, of, these, discussions, are, documented, in, the, pauli, jung, letters, today, published, as, atom, and, archetype, jung, s, elaborate, analysis, of, more, than, 400, of, pauli, s, dreams, is, documented, in, psychology, and, alchemy, in, 1933, pauli, published, the, second, part, of, his, book, on, physics, handbuch, der, physik, which, was, considered, the, definitive, book, on, the, new, field, of, quantum, physics, robert, oppenheimer, called, it, the, only, adult, introduction, to, quantum, mechanics, the, german, annexation, of, austria, in, 1938, made, pauli, a, german, citizen, which, became, a, problem, for, him, in, 1939, after, world, war, ii, broke, out, in, 1940, he, tried, in, vain, to, obtain, swiss, citizenship, which, would, have, allowed, him, to, remain, at, the, eth, in, 1940, pauli, moved, to, the, united, states, where, he, was, employed, as, a, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, 1946, after, the, war, he, became, a, naturalized, u, s, citizen, and, returned, to, z, rich, where, he, mostly, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1949, he, was, granted, swiss, citizenship, in, 1958, pauli, was, awarded, the, max, planck, medal, the, same, year, he, fell, ill, with, pancreatic, cancer, when, his, last, assistant, charles, enz, visited, him, at, the, rotkreuz, hospital, in, z, rich, pauli, asked, him, did, you, see, the, room, number, it, was, 137, throughout, his, life, pauli, had, been, preoccupied, with, the, question, of, why, the, fine, structure, constant, a, dimensionless, fundamental, constant, has, a, value, nearly, equal, to, 1, 137, pauli, died, in, that, room, on, 15, december, 1958, pauli, made, many, important, contributions, as, a, physicist, primarily, in, the, field, of, quantum, mechanics, he, seldom, published, papers, preferring, lengthy, correspondences, with, colleagues, such, as, niels, bohr, from, the, university, of, copenhagen, in, denmark, and, werner, heisenberg, with, whom, he, had, close, friendships, many, of, his, ideas, and, results, were, never, published, and, appeared, only, in, his, letters, which, were, often, copied, and, circulated, by, their, recipients, in, 1921, pauli, worked, with, bohr, to, create, the, aufbau, principle, which, described, building, up, electrons, in, shells, based, on, the, german, word, for, building, up, as, bohr, was, also, fluent, in, german, pauli, proposed, in, 1924, a, new, quantum, degree, of, freedom, or, quantum, number, with, two, possible, values, to, resolve, inconsistencies, between, observed, molecular, spectra, and, the, developing, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, he, formulated, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, perhaps, his, most, important, work, which, stated, that, no, two, electrons, could, exist, in, the, same, quantum, state, identified, by, four, quantum, numbers, including, his, new, two, valued, degree, of, freedom, the, idea, of, spin, originated, with, ralph, kronig, a, year, later, george, uhlenbeck, and, samuel, goudsmit, identified, pauli, s, new, degree, of, freedom, as, electron, spin, in, which, pauli, for, a, very, long, time, wrongly, refused, to, believe, in, 1926, shortly, after, heisenberg, published, the, matrix, theory, of, modern, quantum, mechanics, pauli, used, it, to, derive, the, observed, spectrum, of, the, hydrogen, atom, this, result, was, important, in, securing, credibility, for, heisenberg, s, theory, pauli, introduced, the, 2, 2, pauli, matrices, as, a, basis, of, spin, operators, thus, solving, the, nonrelativistic, theory, of, spin, this, work, including, the, pauli, equation, is, sometimes, said, to, have, influenced, paul, dirac, in, his, creation, of, the, dirac, equation, for, the, relativistic, electron, though, dirac, said, that, he, invented, these, same, matrices, himself, independently, at, the, time, dirac, invented, similar, but, larger, 4x4, spin, matrices, for, use, in, his, relativistic, treatment, of, fermionic, spin, in, 1930, pauli, considered, the, problem, of, beta, decay, in, a, letter, of, 4, december, to, lise, meitner, et, al, beginning, dear, radioactive, ladies, and, gentlemen, he, proposed, the, existence, of, a, hitherto, unobserved, neutral, particle, with, a, small, mass, no, greater, than, 1, the, mass, of, a, proton, to, explain, the, continuous, spectrum, of, beta, decay, in, 1934, enrico, fermi, incorporated, the, particle, which, he, called, a, neutrino, little, neutral, one, in, fermi, s, native, italian, into, his, theory, of, beta, decay, the, neutrino, was, first, confirmed, experimentally, in, 1956, by, frederick, reines, and, clyde, cowan, two, and, a, half, years, before, pauli, s, death, on, receiving, the, news, he, replied, by, telegram, thanks, for, message, everything, comes, to, him, who, knows, how, to, wait, pauli, in, 1940, pauli, re, derived, the, spin, statistics, theorem, a, critical, result, of, quantum, field, theory, that, states, that, particles, with, half, integer, spin, are, fermions, while, particles, with, integer, spin, are, bosons, in, 1949, he, published, a, paper, on, pauli, villars, regularization, regularization, is, the, term, for, techniques, that, modify, infinite, mathematical, integrals, to, make, them, finite, during, calculations, so, that, one, can, identify, whether, the, intrinsically, infinite, quantities, in, the, theory, mass, charge, wavefunction, form, a, finite, and, hence, calculable, set, that, can, be, redefined, in, terms, of, their, experimental, values, which, criterion, is, termed, renormalization, and, which, removes, infinities, from, quantum, field, theories, but, also, importantly, allows, the, calculation, of, higher, order, corrections, in, perturbation, theory, pauli, made, repeated, criticisms, of, the, modern, synthesis, of, evolutionary, biology, and, his, contemporary, admirers, point, to, modes, of, epigenetic, inheritance, as, supporting, his, arguments, paul, drude, in, 1900, proposed, the, first, theoretical, model, for, a, classical, electron, moving, through, a, metallic, solid, drude, s, classical, model, was, also, augmented, by, pauli, and, other, physicists, pauli, realized, that, the, free, electrons, in, metal, must, obey, the, fermi, dirac, statistics, using, this, idea, he, developed, the, theory, of, paramagnetism, in, 1926, pauli, said, festk, rperphysik, ist, eine, schmutzphysik, solid, state, physics, is, the, physics, of, dirt, pauli, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1953, and, president, of, the, swiss, physical, society, in, 1955, for, two, years, in, 1958, he, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, the, pauli, effect, was, named, after, his, anecdotal, bizarre, ability, to, break, experimental, equipment, simply, by, being, in, its, vicinity, pauli, was, aware, of, his, reputation, and, was, delighted, whenever, the, pauli, effect, manifested, these, strange, occurrences, were, in, line, with, his, controversial, investigations, into, the, legitimacy, of, parapsychology, particularly, his, collaboration, with, c, g, jung, on, synchronicity, max, born, considered, pauli, only, comparable, to, einstein, himself, perhaps, even, greater, einstein, declared, pauli, his, spiritual, heir, pauli, was, famously, a, perfectionist, this, extended, not, just, to, his, own, work, but, also, to, that, of, his, colleagues, as, a, result, he, became, known, in, the, physics, community, as, the, conscience, of, physics, the, critic, to, whom, his, colleagues, were, accountable, he, could, be, scathing, in, his, dismissal, of, any, theory, he, found, lacking, often, labelling, it, ganz, falsch, utterly, wrong, but, this, was, not, his, most, severe, criticism, which, he, reserved, for, theories, or, theses, so, unclearly, presented, as, to, be, untestable, or, unevaluatable, and, thus, not, properly, belonging, within, the, realm, of, science, even, though, posing, as, such, they, were, worse, than, wrong, because, they, could, not, be, proved, wrong, famously, he, once, said, of, such, an, unclear, paper, it, is, not, even, wrong, his, supposed, remark, when, meeting, another, leading, physicist, paul, ehrenfest, illustrates, this, notion, of, an, arrogant, pauli, the, two, met, at, a, conference, for, the, first, time, ehrenfest, was, familiar, with, pauli, s, papers, and, quite, impressed, with, them, after, a, few, minutes, of, conversation, ehrenfest, remarked, i, think, i, like, your, encyclopedia, article, better, than, i, like, you, to, which, pauli, retorted, that, s, strange, with, me, regarding, you, it, is, just, the, opposite, the, two, became, very, good, friends, from, then, on, a, somewhat, warmer, picture, emerges, from, this, story, which, appears, in, the, article, on, dirac, werner, heisenberg, recollects, a, friendly, conversation, among, young, participants, at, the, 1927, solvay, conference, about, einstein, and, planck, s, views, on, religion, wolfgang, pauli, heisenberg, and, dirac, took, part, in, it, dirac, s, contribution, was, a, poignant, and, clear, criticism, of, the, political, manipulation, of, religion, that, was, much, appreciated, for, its, lucidity, by, bohr, when, heisenberg, reported, it, to, him, later, among, other, things, dirac, said, i, cannot, understand, why, we, idle, discussing, religion, if, we, are, honest, and, as, scientists, honesty, is, our, precise, duty, we, cannot, help, but, admit, that, any, religion, is, a, pack, of, false, statements, deprived, of, any, real, foundation, the, very, idea, of, god, is, a, product, of, human, imagination, i, do, not, recognize, any, religious, myth, at, least, because, they, contradict, one, another, heisenberg, s, view, was, tolerant, pauli, had, kept, silent, after, some, initial, remarks, but, when, finally, he, was, asked, for, his, opinion, jokingly, he, said, well, i, d, say, that, also, our, friend, dirac, has, got, a, religion, and, the, first, commandment, of, this, religion, is, god, does, not, exist, and, paul, dirac, is, his, prophet, everybody, burst, into, laughter, including, dirac, many, of, pauli, s, ideas, and, results, were, never, published, and, appeared, only, in, his, letters, which, were, often, copied, and, circulated, by, their, recipients, pauli, may, have, been, unconcerned, that, much, of, his, work, thus, went, uncredited, but, when, it, came, to, heisenberg, s, world, renowned, 1958, lecture, at, g, ttingen, on, their, joint, work, on, a, unified, field, theory, and, the, press, release, calling, pauli, a, mere, assistant, to, professor, heisenberg, pauli, became, offended, denouncing, heisenberg, s, physics, prowess, the, deterioration, of, their, relationship, resulted, in, heisenberg, ignoring, pauli, s, funeral, and, writing, in, his, autobiography, that, pauli, s, criticisms, were, overwrought, though, ultimately, the, field, theory, was, proved, untenable, validating, pauli, s, criticisms, in, his, discussions, with, carl, jung, pauli, developed, an, ontological, theory, that, has, been, dubbed, the, pauli, jung, conjecture, and, has, been, seen, as, a, kind, of, dual, aspect, theory, the, theory, holds, that, there, is, a, psychophysically, neutral, reality, and, that, mental, and, physical, aspects, are, derivative, of, this, reality, pauli, thought, that, elements, of, quantum, physics, pointed, to, a, deeper, reality, that, might, explain, the, mind, matter, gap, and, wrote, we, must, postulate, a, cosmic, order, of, nature, beyond, our, control, to, which, both, the, outward, material, objects, and, the, inward, images, are, subject, pauli, and, jung, held, that, this, reality, was, governed, by, common, principles, archetypes, that, appear, as, psychological, phenomena, or, as, physical, events, they, also, held, that, synchronicities, might, reveal, some, of, this, underlying, reality, s, workings, he, is, considered, to, have, been, a, deist, and, a, mystic, in, no, time, to, be, brief, a, scientific, biography, of, wolfgang, pauli, he, is, quoted, as, writing, to, science, historian, shmuel, sambursky, in, opposition, to, the, monotheist, religions, but, in, unison, with, the, mysticism, of, all, peoples, including, the, jewish, mysticism, i, believe, that, the, ultimate, reality, is, not, personal, in, 1929, pauli, married, k, the, margarethe, deppner, a, cabaret, dancer, the, marriage, was, unhappy, ending, in, divorce, after, less, than, a, year, he, married, again, in, 1934, to, franziska, bertram, 1901, 1987, they, had, no, children, pauli, died, of, pancreatic, cancer, on, december, 15, 1958, at, age, 58
