arius, r, a, s, r, i, koin, greek, reios, 250, or, 256, 336, was, a, cyrenaic, presbyter, ascetic, and, priest, he, has, been, traditionally, regarded, as, the, founder, of, arianism, which, holds, that, jesus, christ, was, not, coeternal, with, god, the, father, but, was, rather, created, before, time, arian, theology, and, its, doctrine, regarding, the, nature, of, the, godhead, held, in, common, a, belief, in, subordinationism, with, most, christian, theologians, of, the, 3rd, century, with, the, notable, exception, of, athanasius, of, alexandria, constantine, the, great, s, formal, adoption, of, christianity, into, the, roman, empire, entailed, the, convention, of, ecumenical, councils, to, remove, theological, divisions, between, opposing, sects, within, the, church, arius, s, theology, was, a, prominent, topic, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, where, arianism, was, condemned, in, favor, of, homoousian, conceptions, of, god, and, jesus, opposition, to, arianism, remains, embodied, in, the, nicene, creed, described, as, a, deliberately, anti, arian, document, nevertheless, despite, concerted, opposition, arian, churches, persisted, for, centuries, throughout, europe, especially, in, various, germanic, kingdoms, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, they, were, suppressed, by, military, conquest, or, by, voluntary, royal, conversion, between, the, fifth, and, seventh, centuries, arius, s, role, as, the, sole, originator, of, arian, theology, has, been, disputed, by, historians, such, as, rowan, williams, who, stated, that, arius, role, in, arianism, was, not, that, of, the, founder, of, a, sect, it, was, not, his, individual, teaching, that, dominated, the, mid, century, eastern, church, richard, hanson, writes, that, arius, specific, espousal, of, subordinationist, theology, brought, into, unavoidable, prominence, a, doctrinal, crisis, which, had, gradually, been, gathering, he, was, the, spark, that, started, the, explosion, but, in, himself, he, was, of, no, great, significance, the, association, between, arius, and, the, theology, titled, after, him, has, been, argued, to, be, a, creation, based, on, the, polemic, of, nicene, writers, such, as, athanasius, of, alexandria, a, homoousian, reconstructing, the, life, and, doctrine, of, arius, has, proven, to, be, a, difficult, task, arius, was, of, berber, descent, his, father, s, name, is, given, as, ammonius, hanson, says, that, arius, very, probably, had, at, some, time, studied, with, lucian, of, antioch, because, he, refers, to, somebody, else, as, truly, a, fellow, disciple, of, lucian, but, williams, questions, whether, we, should, assume, from, the, one, word, in, arius, letter, that, he, had, actually, been, lucian, s, student, in, the, past, many, writers, have, assumed, that, our, arius, is, the, same, as, the, arius, who, was, involved, in, the, melitian, schism, who, had, an, outward, appearance, of, piety, and, was, eager, to, be, a, teacher, however, after, several, pages, of, detailed, analysis, williams, concludes, that, the, melitian, arius, melt, s, away, under, close, investigation, in, 313, arius, was, made, presbyter, of, the, baucalis, district, in, alexandria, arius, views, have, always, been, represented, as, some, hopelessly, defective, form, of, belief, contrary, to, this, view, rowan, williams, recently, concluded, that, arius, is, a, thinker, and, exegete, of, resourcefulness, sharpness, and, originality, although, his, character, has, been, severely, assailed, by, his, opponents, arius, appears, to, have, been, a, man, of, personal, ascetic, achievement, pure, morals, and, decided, convictions, he, was, very, tall, in, stature, with, downcast, countenance, always, garbed, in, a, short, cloak, and, sleeveless, tunic, he, spoke, gently, and, people, found, him, persuasive, and, flattering, it, is, traditional, to, claim, that, arius, was, a, deliberate, radical, breaking, away, from, the, orthodoxy, of, the, church, fathers, however, a, great, deal, of, recent, work, seeking, to, understand, arian, spirituality, has, not, surprisingly, helped, to, demolish, the, notion, of, arius, and, his, supporters, as, deliberate, radicals, attacking, a, time, honoured, tradition, arius, was, a, committed, theological, conservative, more, specifically, a, conservative, alexandrian, very, little, of, arius, writing, has, survived, as, far, as, his, own, writings, go, we, have, no, more, than, three, letters, and, a, few, fragments, of, another, the, three, are, the, thalia, is, arius, only, known, theological, work, but, we, do, not, possess, a, single, complete, and, continuous, text, we, only, have, extracts, from, it, in, the, writings, of, arius, enemies, mostly, from, the, pen, of, athanasius, of, alexandria, his, bitterest, and, most, prejudiced, enemy, emperor, constantine, ordered, their, burning, while, arius, was, still, living, but, r, p, c, hanson, concluded, that, so, little, survived, because, the, people, of, his, day, whether, they, agreed, with, him, or, not, did, not, regard, him, arius, as, a, particularly, significant, writer, those, works, which, have, survived, are, quoted, in, the, works, of, churchmen, who, denounced, him, as, a, heretic, this, leads, some, but, not, all, scholars, to, question, their, reliability, for, example, bishop, r, p, c, hanson, wrote, athanasius, a, fierce, opponent, of, arius, certainly, would, not, have, stopped, short, of, misrepresenting, what, he, said, athanasius, may, be, suspected, of, pressing, the, words, maliciously, rather, further, than, arius, intended, archbishop, rowan, williams, agrees, that, athanasius, applied, unscrupulous, tactics, in, polemic, and, struggle, the, diocletianic, persecution, great, persecution, of, ad, 303, 313, was, rome, s, final, attempt, to, limit, the, expansion, of, christianity, across, the, empire, that, persecution, came, to, an, end, when, christianity, was, legalized, with, galerius, edict, of, toleration, in, 311, followed, by, constantine, s, edict, of, milan, in, 313, after, emperor, constantine, himself, had, become, a, christian, the, arian, controversy, began, only, 5, years, later, in, 318, when, arius, who, was, in, charge, of, one, of, the, churches, in, alexandria, publicly, criticized, his, bishop, alexander, for, carelessness, in, blurring, the, distinction, of, nature, between, the, father, and, the, son, by, his, emphasis, on, eternal, generation, the, trinitarian, historian, socrates, of, constantinople, reports, that, arius, sparked, the, controversy, that, bears, his, name, when, alexander, of, alexandria, who, had, succeeded, achillas, as, the, bishop, of, alexandria, gave, a, sermon, stating, the, similarity, of, the, son, to, the, father, arius, interpreted, alexander, s, speech, as, being, a, revival, of, sabellianism, condemned, it, and, then, argued, that, if, the, father, begat, the, son, he, that, was, begotten, had, a, beginning, of, existence, and, from, this, it, is, evident, that, there, was, a, time, when, the, son, was, not, it, therefore, necessarily, follows, that, he, had, his, substance, from, nothing, this, quote, describes, the, essence, of, arius, s, doctrine, socrates, of, constantinople, believed, that, arius, was, influenced, in, his, thinking, by, the, teachings, of, lucian, of, antioch, a, celebrated, christian, teacher, and, martyr, in, a, letter, to, patriarch, alexander, of, constantinople, arius, s, bishop, alexander, of, alexandria, wrote, that, arius, derived, his, theology, from, lucian, the, express, purpose, of, the, letter, was, to, complain, about, the, doctrines, that, arius, was, spreading, but, his, charge, of, heresy, against, arius, is, vague, and, unsupported, by, other, authorities, furthermore, alexander, s, language, like, that, of, most, controversialists, in, those, days, is, quite, bitter, and, abusive, moreover, even, alexander, never, accused, lucian, of, having, taught, arianism, it, is, traditionally, taught, that, arius, had, wide, support, in, the, areas, of, the, roman, empire, but, it, now, seems, his, supporters, were, limited, to, egypt, and, alexandria, the, controversy, had, spread, from, alexandria, into, almost, all, the, african, regions, and, was, considered, a, disturbance, of, the, public, order, by, the, roman, empire, eusebius, of, caesarea, in, the, life, of, constantine, the, thalia, appears, to, have, circulated, only, in, alexandria, what, is, known, of, him, elsewhere, seems, to, stem, from, athanasius, quotations, he, also, had, the, support, of, perhaps, the, two, most, important, church, leaders, of, that, time, eusebius, of, nicomedia, was, a, supporter, of, arius, as, long, as, arius, lived, the, conventional, picture, of, eusebius, is, of, an, unscrupulous, intriguer, this, is, of, course, because, our, knowledge, of, eusebius, derives, almost, entirely, from, the, evidence, of, his, bitter, enemies, hanson, mentions, several, instances, displaying, eusebius, integrity, and, courage, and, concludes, eusebius, certainly, was, a, man, of, strong, character, and, great, ability, page, 29, it, was, he, who, virtually, took, charge, of, the, affairs, of, the, greek, speaking, eastern, church, from, 328, until, his, death, page, 29, he, encouraged, the, spread, of, the, christian, faith, beyond, the, frontiers, of, the, roman, empire, the, version, of, the, christian, faith, which, the, missionaries, spread, was, that, favoured, by, eusebius, and, not, athanasius, this, serves, as, evidence, of, his, zeal, eusebius, bishop, of, caesarea, in, palestine, was, certainly, an, early, supporter, of, arius, he, was, universally, acknowledged, to, be, the, most, scholarly, bishop, of, his, day, eusebius, of, caesarea, was, one, of, the, most, influential, authors, of, the, fourth, century, neither, arius, nor, anti, arians, speak, evil, of, him, he, was, made, bishop, of, caesarea, about, 313, and, attended, the, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, we, cannot, accordingly, describe, eusebius, of, caesarea, as, a, formal, arian, in, the, sense, that, he, knew, and, accepted, the, full, logic, of, arius, or, of, asterius, position, but, undoubtedly, he, approached, it, nearly, like, many, third, century, christian, scholars, arius, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, origen, widely, regarded, as, the, first, great, theologian, of, christianity, however, while, both, agreed, on, the, subordination, of, the, son, to, the, father, and, arius, drew, support, from, origen, s, theories, on, the, logos, the, two, did, not, agree, on, everything, for, example, hanson, concluded, arius, probably, inherited, some, terms, and, even, some, ideas, from, origen, he, certainly, did, not, adopt, any, large, or, significant, part, of, origen, s, theology, he, was, not, without, influence, from, origen, but, cannot, seriously, be, called, an, origenist, however, because, origen, s, theological, speculations, were, often, proffered, to, stimulate, further, inquiry, rather, than, to, put, an, end, to, any, given, dispute, both, arius, and, his, opponents, were, able, to, invoke, the, authority, of, this, revered, at, the, time, theologian, during, their, debate, arius, emphasized, the, supremacy, and, uniqueness, of, god, the, father, meaning, that, the, father, alone, is, infinite, and, eternal, and, almighty, and, that, therefore, the, father, s, divinity, must, be, greater, than, the, son, s, arius, maintained, that, the, son, possessed, neither, the, eternity, nor, the, true, divinity, of, the, father, but, was, rather, made, god, only, by, the, father, s, permission, and, power, many, summary, accounts, present, the, arian, controversy, as, a, dispute, over, whether, or, not, christ, was, divine, it, is, misleading, to, assume, that, these, controversies, were, about, the, divinity, of, christ, many, fourth, century, theologians, including, some, who, were, in, no, way, anti, nicene, made, distinctions, between, being, god, and, being, true, god, that, belie, any, simple, account, of, the, controversy, in, these, terms, it, must, be, understood, that, in, the, fourth, century, the, word, god, theos, deus, had, not, acquired, the, significance, which, in, our, twentieth, century, world, it, has, acquired, viz, the, one, and, sole, true, god, the, word, could, apply, to, many, gradations, of, divinity, and, was, not, as, absolute, to, athanasius, as, it, is, to, us, the, bishop, of, alexandria, exiled, the, presbyter, following, a, council, of, local, priests, arius, s, supporters, vehemently, protested, numerous, bishops, and, christian, leaders, of, the, era, supported, his, cause, among, them, eusebius, of, nicomedia, who, baptized, constantine, the, great, the, christological, debate, could, no, longer, be, contained, within, the, alexandrian, diocese, by, the, time, bishop, alexander, finally, acted, against, arius, arius, s, doctrine, had, spread, far, beyond, his, own, see, it, had, become, a, topic, of, discussion, and, disturbance, for, the, entire, church, the, church, was, now, a, powerful, force, in, the, roman, world, with, emperors, licinius, and, constantine, i, having, legalized, it, in, 313, through, the, edict, of, milan, emperor, constantine, had, taken, a, personal, interest, in, several, ecumenical, issues, including, the, donatist, controversy, in, 316, and, he, wanted, to, bring, an, end, to, the, christological, dispute, to, this, end, the, emperor, sent, hosius, bishop, of, c, rdoba, to, investigate, and, if, possible, resolve, the, controversy, hosius, was, armed, with, an, open, letter, from, the, emperor, wherefore, let, each, one, of, you, showing, consideration, for, the, other, listen, to, the, impartial, exhortation, of, your, fellow, servant, however, as, the, debate, continued, to, rage, despite, hosius, s, efforts, constantine, in, ad, 325, took, an, unprecedented, step, he, called, a, council, to, be, composed, of, church, prelates, from, all, parts, of, the, empire, to, resolve, this, issue, possibly, at, hosius, s, recommendation, around, 250, 300, attended, drawn, almost, entirely, from, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, pope, sylvester, i, himself, too, aged, to, attend, sent, two, priests, as, his, delegates, arius, himself, attended, the, council, as, did, his, bishop, alexander, also, there, were, eusebius, of, caesarea, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, the, young, deacon, athanasius, who, would, become, the, champion, of, the, trinitarian, view, ultimately, adopted, by, the, council, and, spend, most, of, his, life, battling, arianism, before, the, main, conclave, convened, hosius, initially, met, with, alexander, and, his, supporters, at, nicomedia, the, council, was, presided, over, by, the, emperor, himself, who, participated, in, and, even, led, some, of, its, discussions, at, this, first, council, of, nicaea, 22, bishops, led, by, eusebius, of, nicomedia, came, as, supporters, of, arius, nonetheless, when, some, of, arius, s, writings, were, read, aloud, they, are, reported, to, have, been, denounced, as, blasphemous, by, most, participants, those, who, upheld, the, notion, that, christ, was, co, eternal, and, consubstantial, with, the, father, were, led, by, the, bishop, alexander, athanasius, was, not, allowed, to, sit, in, on, the, council, because, he, was, only, an, arch, deacon, however, athanasius, is, seen, as, doing, the, legwork, and, concluded, according, to, bishop, alexander, s, defense, of, athanasian, trinitarianism, and, also, according, to, the, nicene, creed, adopted, at, this, council, that, the, son, was, of, the, same, essence, homoousios, with, the, father, or, one, in, essence, with, the, father, and, was, eternally, generated, from, that, essence, of, the, father, those, who, instead, insisted, that, the, son, of, god, came, after, god, the, father, in, time, and, substance, were, led, by, arius, the, presbyter, for, about, two, months, the, two, sides, argued, and, debated, with, each, appealing, to, scripture, to, justify, their, respective, positions, arius, argued, for, the, supremacy, of, god, the, father, and, maintained, that, the, son, of, god, was, simply, the, oldest, and, most, beloved, creature, of, god, made, from, nothing, because, of, being, the, direct, offspring, arius, taught, that, the, pre, existent, son, was, god, s, first, production, the, very, first, thing, that, god, actually, ever, did, in, his, entire, eternal, existence, up, to, that, point, before, all, ages, thus, he, insisted, that, only, god, the, father, had, no, beginning, and, that, the, father, alone, was, infinite, and, eternal, arius, maintained, that, the, son, had, a, beginning, thus, said, arius, only, the, son, was, directly, created, and, begotten, of, god, furthermore, there, was, a, time, that, he, had, no, existence, he, was, capable, of, his, own, free, will, said, arius, and, thus, were, he, in, the, truest, sense, a, son, he, must, have, come, after, the, father, therefore, the, time, obviously, was, when, he, was, not, and, hence, he, was, a, finite, being, arius, appealed, to, scripture, quoting, verses, such, as, john, 14, 28, the, father, is, greater, than, i, as, well, as, colossians, 1, 15, the, firstborn, of, all, creation, thus, arius, insisted, that, the, father, s, divinity, was, greater, than, the, son, s, and, that, the, son, was, under, god, the, father, and, not, co, equal, or, co, eternal, with, him, according, to, some, accounts, in, the, hagiography, of, nicholas, of, myra, debate, at, the, council, became, so, heated, that, at, one, point, nicholas, struck, arius, across, the, face, the, majority, of, the, bishops, ultimately, agreed, upon, a, creed, known, thereafter, as, the, nicene, creed, it, included, the, word, homoousios, meaning, consubstantial, or, one, in, essence, which, was, incompatible, with, arius, s, beliefs, on, june, 19, 325, council, and, emperor, issued, a, circular, to, the, churches, in, and, around, alexandria, arius, and, two, of, his, unyielding, partisans, theonas, and, secundus, were, deposed, and, exiled, to, illyricum, while, three, other, supporters, theognis, of, nicaea, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, maris, of, chalcedon, affixed, their, signatures, solely, out, of, deference, to, the, emperor, the, following, is, part, of, the, ruling, made, by, the, emperor, denouncing, arius, s, teachings, with, fervor, in, addition, if, any, writing, composed, by, arius, should, be, found, it, should, be, handed, over, to, the, flames, so, that, not, only, will, the, wickedness, of, his, teaching, be, obliterated, but, nothing, will, be, left, even, to, remind, anyone, of, him, and, i, hereby, make, a, public, order, that, if, someone, should, be, discovered, to, have, hidden, a, writing, composed, by, arius, and, not, to, have, immediately, brought, it, forward, and, destroyed, it, by, fire, his, penalty, shall, be, death, as, soon, as, he, is, discovered, in, this, offense, he, shall, be, submitted, for, capital, punishment, the, homoousian, party, s, victory, at, nicaea, was, short, lived, however, despite, arius, exile, and, the, alleged, finality, of, the, council, s, decrees, the, arian, controversy, recommenced, at, once, when, bishop, alexander, died, in, 327, athanasius, succeeded, him, despite, not, meeting, the, age, requirements, for, a, hierarch, still, committed, to, pacifying, the, conflict, between, arians, and, trinitarians, constantine, gradually, became, more, lenient, toward, those, whom, the, council, of, nicaea, had, exiled, though, he, never, repudiated, the, council, or, its, decrees, the, emperor, ultimately, permitted, arius, who, had, taken, refuge, in, palestine, and, many, of, his, adherents, to, return, to, their, homes, once, arius, had, reformulated, his, christology, to, mute, the, ideas, found, most, objectionable, by, his, critics, athanasius, was, exiled, following, his, condemnation, by, the, first, synod, of, tyre, in, 335, though, he, was, later, recalled, and, the, synod, of, jerusalem, the, following, year, restored, arius, to, communion, the, emperor, directed, alexander, of, constantinople, to, receive, arius, despite, the, bishop, s, objections, bishop, alexander, responded, by, earnestly, praying, that, arius, might, perish, before, this, could, happen, modern, scholars, consider, that, the, subsequent, death, of, arius, may, have, been, the, result, of, poisoning, by, his, opponents, in, contrast, some, contemporaries, of, arius, asserted, that, the, circumstances, of, his, death, were, a, miraculous, consequence, of, arius, s, heretical, views, the, latter, view, was, evident, in, the, account, of, arius, s, death, by, a, bitter, enemy, socrates, scholasticus, it, was, then, saturday, and, arius, was, expecting, to, assemble, with, the, church, on, the, day, following, but, divine, retribution, overtook, his, daring, criminalities, for, going, out, of, the, imperial, palace, attended, by, a, crowd, of, eusebian, partisans, like, guards, he, paraded, proudly, through, the, midst, of, the, city, attracting, the, notice, of, all, the, people, as, he, approached, the, place, called, constantine, s, forum, where, the, column, of, porphyry, is, erected, a, terror, arising, from, the, remorse, of, conscience, seized, arius, and, with, the, terror, a, violent, relaxation, of, the, bowels, he, therefore, enquired, whether, there, was, a, convenient, place, near, and, being, directed, to, the, back, of, constantine, s, forum, he, hastened, thither, soon, after, a, faintness, came, over, him, and, together, with, the, evacuations, his, bowels, protruded, followed, by, a, copious, hemorrhage, and, the, descent, of, the, smaller, intestines, moreover, portions, of, his, spleen, and, liver, were, brought, off, in, the, effusion, of, blood, so, that, he, almost, immediately, died, the, scene, of, this, catastrophe, still, is, shown, at, constantinople, as, i, have, said, behind, the, shambles, in, the, colonnade, and, by, persons, going, by, pointing, the, finger, at, the, place, there, is, a, perpetual, remembrance, preserved, of, this, extraordinary, kind, of, death, the, death, of, arius, did, not, end, the, arian, controversy, which, would, not, be, settled, for, centuries, in, some, parts, of, the, christian, world, historians, report, that, constantine, who, had, not, been, baptized, for, most, of, his, lifetime, was, baptized, on, his, deathbed, in, 337, by, the, arian, bishop, eusebius, of, nicomedia, constantius, ii, who, succeeded, constantine, was, an, arian, sympathizer, under, him, arianism, reached, its, high, point, at, the, third, council, of, sirmium, in, 357, the, seventh, arian, confession, second, sirmium, confession, held, regarding, the, doctrines, homoousios, of, one, substance, and, homoiousios, of, similar, substance, that, both, were, non, biblical, and, that, the, father, is, greater, than, the, son, a, confession, later, dubbed, the, blasphemy, of, sirmium, but, since, many, persons, are, disturbed, by, questions, concerning, what, is, called, in, latin, substantia, but, in, greek, ousia, that, is, to, make, it, understood, more, exactly, as, to, coessential, or, what, is, called, like, in, essence, there, ought, to, be, no, mention, of, any, of, these, at, all, nor, exposition, of, them, in, the, church, for, this, reason, and, for, this, consideration, that, in, divine, scripture, nothing, is, written, about, them, and, that, they, are, above, men, s, knowledge, and, above, men, s, understanding, following, the, abortive, effort, by, julian, the, apostate, to, restore, paganism, in, the, empire, the, emperor, valens, himself, an, arian, renewed, the, persecution, of, nicene, bishops, however, valens, s, successor, theodosius, i, ended, arianism, once, and, for, all, among, the, elites, of, the, eastern, empire, through, a, combination, of, imperial, decree, persecution, and, the, calling, of, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, that, condemned, arius, anew, while, reaffirming, and, expanding, the, nicene, creed, this, generally, ended, the, influence, of, arianism, among, the, non, germanic, peoples, of, the, roman, empire, arianism, played, out, very, differently, in, the, western, empire, during, the, reign, of, constantius, ii, the, arian, gothic, convert, ulfilas, was, consecrated, a, bishop, by, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, sent, to, missionize, his, people, his, success, ensured, the, survival, of, arianism, among, the, goths, and, vandals, until, the, beginning, of, the, eighth, century, when, their, kingdoms, succumbed, to, the, adjacent, niceans, or, they, accepted, nicean, christianity, arians, continued, to, exist, in, north, africa, spain, and, portions, of, italy, until, they, were, finally, suppressed, during, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, in, the, 12th, century, the, benedictine, abbot, peter, the, venerable, described, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, as, the, successor, of, arius, and, the, precursor, to, the, antichrist, during, the, protestant, reformation, a, polish, sect, known, as, the, polish, brethren, were, often, referred, to, as, arians, due, to, their, antitrinitarian, doctrine, there, are, several, contemporary, christian, and, post, christian, denominations, today, that, echo, arian, thinking, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, are, sometimes, accused, of, being, arians, by, their, detractors, however, the, christology, of, the, latter, day, saints, differs, in, several, significant, aspects, from, arian, theology, the, jehovah, s, witnesses, teach, that, the, son, is, a, created, being, and, is, not, actually, god, but, rather, his, only, begotten, son, some, christians, in, the, unitarian, universalist, movement, are, influenced, by, arian, ideas, contemporary, unitarian, universalist, christians, often, may, be, either, arian, or, socian, in, their, christology, seeing, jesus, as, a, distinctive, moral, figure, but, not, equal, or, eternal, with, god, the, father, or, they, may, follow, origen, s, logic, of, universal, salvation, and, thus, potentially, affirm, the, trinity, but, assert, that, all, are, already, saved, according, to, the, reincarnationist, religion, of, spiritism, jesus, the, highest, order, spirit, that, has, ever, incarnated, on, earth, is, distinct, from, god, by, whom, he, was, created, jesus, is, not, considered, god, or, part, of, god, as, in, nicene, christianity, but, nonetheless, the, ultimate, model, of, human, love, intelligence, and, forgiveness, often, cited, as, the, governor, of, earth, in, explaining, his, actions, against, arius, alexander, of, alexandria, wrote, a, letter, to, alexander, of, constantinople, and, eusebius, of, nicomedia, where, the, emperor, was, then, residing, detailing, the, errors, into, which, he, believed, arius, had, fallen, according, to, alexander, arius, taught, that, god, was, not, always, the, father, but, that, there, was, a, period, when, he, was, not, the, father, that, the, word, of, god, was, not, from, eternity, but, was, made, out, of, nothing, for, that, the, ever, existing, god, the, i, am, the, eternal, one, made, him, who, did, not, previously, exist, out, of, nothing, wherefore, there, was, a, time, when, he, did, not, exist, inasmuch, as, the, son, is, a, creature, and, a, work, that, he, is, neither, like, the, father, as, it, regards, his, essence, nor, is, by, nature, either, the, father, s, true, word, or, true, wisdom, but, indeed, one, of, his, works, and, creatures, being, erroneously, called, word, and, wisdom, since, he, was, himself, made, of, god, s, own, word, and, the, wisdom, which, is, in, god, whereby, god, both, made, all, things, and, him, also, wherefore, he, is, as, to, his, nature, mutable, and, susceptible, of, change, as, all, other, rational, creatures, are, hence, the, word, is, alien, to, and, other, than, the, essence, of, god, and, the, father, is, inexplicable, by, the, son, and, invisible, to, him, for, neither, does, the, word, perfectly, and, accurately, know, the, father, neither, can, he, distinctly, see, him, the, son, knows, not, the, nature, of, his, own, essence, for, he, was, made, on, our, account, in, order, that, god, might, create, us, by, him, as, by, an, instrument, nor, would, he, ever, have, existed, unless, god, had, wished, to, create, us, alexander, also, refers, to, arius, s, poetical, thalia, god, has, not, always, been, father, there, was, a, moment, when, he, was, alone, and, was, not, yet, father, later, he, became, so, the, son, is, not, from, eternity, he, came, from, nothing, eusebius, of, caesarea, in, his, famous, book, the, ecclesiastical, history, explains, arius, views, as, that, god, has, not, always, been, a, father, and, that, there, was, a, time, when, the, son, was, not, that, the, son, is, a, creature, like, the, others, that, he, is, mutable, by, his, nature, that, by, his, free, will, he, chose, to, remain, virtuous, but, that, he, might, change, like, others, he, said, that, jesus, christ, was, not, true, god, but, divine, by, participation, like, all, others, to, whom, the, name, of, god, is, attributed, he, added, that, he, was, not, the, substantial, word, of, the, father, and, his, proper, wisdom, by, which, he, had, made, all, things, but, that, he, was, himself, made, by, the, eternal, wisdom, that, he, is, foreign, in, every, thing, from, the, substance, of, the, father, that, we, were, not, made, for, him, but, he, for, us, when, it, was, the, pleasure, of, god, who, was, before, alone, to, create, us, that, he, was, made, by, the, will, of, god, as, others, are, having, no, previous, existence, at, all, since, he, is, not, a, proper, and, natural, production, of, the, father, but, an, effect, of, his, grace, the, father, he, continued, is, invisible, to, the, son, and, the, son, cannot, know, him, perfectly, nor, indeed, can, he, know, his, own, substance, the, question, of, the, exact, relationship, between, the, father, and, the, son, a, part, of, the, theological, science, of, christology, had, been, raised, some, fifty, years, before, arius, when, paul, of, samosata, was, deposed, in, 269, for, agreeing, with, those, who, used, the, word, homoousios, greek, for, same, substance, to, express, the, relation, between, the, father, and, the, son, this, term, was, thought, at, that, time, to, have, a, sabellian, tendency, though, as, events, showed, this, was, on, account, of, its, scope, not, having, been, satisfactorily, defined, in, the, discussion, which, followed, paul, s, deposition, dionysius, the, bishop, of, alexandria, used, much, the, same, language, as, arius, did, later, and, correspondence, survives, in, which, pope, dionysius, blames, him, for, using, such, terminology, dionysius, responded, with, an, explanation, widely, interpreted, as, vacillating, the, synod, of, antioch, which, condemned, paul, of, samosata, had, expressed, its, disapproval, of, the, word, homoousios, in, one, sense, while, bishop, alexander, undertook, its, defense, in, another, although, the, controversy, seemed, to, be, leaning, toward, the, opinions, later, championed, by, arius, no, firm, decision, had, been, made, on, the, subject, in, an, atmosphere, so, intellectual, as, that, of, alexandria, the, debate, seemed, bound, to, resurface, and, even, intensify, at, some, point, in, the, future, arius, endorsed, the, following, doctrines, about, the, son, or, the, word, logos, referring, to, jesus, three, surviving, letters, attributed, to, arius, are, his, letter, to, alexander, of, alexandria, his, letter, to, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, his, confession, to, constantine, in, addition, several, letters, addressed, by, others, to, arius, survive, together, with, brief, quotations, contained, within, the, polemical, works, of, his, opponents, these, quotations, are, often, short, and, taken, out, of, context, and, it, is, difficult, to, tell, how, accurately, they, quote, him, or, represent, his, true, thinking, arius, s, thalia, literally, festivity, banquet, a, popularized, work, combining, prose, and, verse, and, summarizing, his, views, on, the, logos, survives, in, quoted, fragmentary, form, in, the, thalia, arius, says, that, god, s, first, thought, was, the, creation, of, the, son, before, all, ages, therefore, time, started, with, the, creation, of, the, logos, or, word, in, heaven, lines, 1, 9, 30, 32, arius, explains, how, the, son, could, still, be, god, even, if, he, did, not, exist, eternally, lines, 20, 23, and, endeavors, to, explain, the, ultimate, incomprehensibility, of, the, father, to, the, son, lines, 33, 39, the, two, available, references, from, this, work, are, recorded, by, his, opponent, athanasius, the, first, is, a, report, of, arius, s, teaching, in, orations, against, the, arians, 1, 5, 6, this, paraphrase, has, negative, comments, interspersed, throughout, so, it, is, difficult, to, consider, it, as, being, completely, reliable, the, second, quotation, appears, on, page, 15, of, the, document, on, the, councils, of, arminum, and, seleucia, also, known, as, de, synodis, this, second, passage, entirely, in, irregular, verse, seems, to, be, a, direct, quotation, or, a, compilation, of, quotations, it, may, have, been, written, by, someone, other, than, athanasius, perhaps, even, a, person, sympathetic, to, arius, this, second, quotation, does, not, contain, several, statements, usually, attributed, to, arius, by, his, opponents, is, in, metrical, form, and, resembles, other, passages, that, have, been, attributed, to, arius, it, also, contains, some, positive, statements, about, the, son, but, although, these, quotations, seem, reasonably, accurate, their, proper, context, is, lost, so, their, place, in, arius, s, larger, system, of, thought, is, impossible, to, reconstruct, the, part, of, arius, s, thalia, quoted, in, athanasius, s, de, synodis, is, the, longest, extant, fragment, the, most, commonly, cited, edition, of, de, synodis, is, by, hans, georg, opitz, a, translation, of, this, fragment, has, been, made, by, aaron, j, west, but, based, not, on, opitz, text, but, on, a, previous, edition, when, compared, to, opitz, more, recent, edition, of, the, text, we, found, that, our, text, varies, only, in, punctuation, capitalization, and, one, variant, reading, for, line, 5, the, opitz, edition, with, the, west, translation, is, as, follows, and, so, god, himself, as, he, really, is, is, inexpressible, to, all, he, alone, has, no, equal, no, one, similar, and, no, one, of, the, same, glory, we, call, him, unbegotten, in, contrast, to, him, who, by, nature, is, begotten, we, praise, him, as, without, beginning, in, contrast, to, him, who, has, a, beginning, we, worship, him, as, timeless, in, contrast, to, him, who, in, time, has, come, to, exist, he, who, is, without, beginning, made, the, son, a, beginning, of, created, things, he, produced, him, as, a, son, for, himself, by, begetting, him, he, has, none, of, the, distinct, characteristics, of, god, s, own, being, for, he, is, not, equal, to, nor, is, he, of, the, same, being, as, him, god, is, wise, for, he, himself, is, the, teacher, of, wisdom, sufficient, proof, that, god, is, invisible, to, all, he, is, invisible, both, to, things, which, were, made, through, the, son, and, also, to, the, son, himself, i, will, say, specifically, how, the, invisible, is, seen, by, the, son, by, that, power, by, which, god, is, able, to, see, each, according, to, his, own, measure, the, son, can, bear, to, see, the, father, as, is, determined, so, there, is, a, triad, not, in, equal, glories, their, beings, are, not, mixed, together, among, themselves, as, far, as, their, glories, one, infinitely, more, glorious, than, the, other, the, father, in, his, essence, is, a, foreigner, to, the, son, because, he, exists, without, beginning, understand, that, the, monad, was, but, the, dyad, was, not, before, it, came, into, existence, it, immediately, follows, that, although, the, son, did, not, exist, the, father, was, still, god, hence, the, son, not, being, came, into, existence, by, the, father, s, will, he, is, the, only, begotten, god, and, this, one, is, alien, from, others, wisdom, came, to, be, wisdom, by, the, will, of, the, wise, god, hence, he, is, conceived, in, innumerable, aspects, he, is, spirit, power, wisdom, god, s, glory, truth, image, and, word, understand, that, he, is, also, conceived, of, as, radiance, and, light, the, one, who, is, superior, is, able, to, beget, one, equal, to, the, son, but, not, someone, more, important, or, superior, or, greater, at, god, s, will, the, son, has, the, greatness, and, qualities, that, he, has, his, existence, from, when, and, from, whom, and, from, then, are, all, from, god, he, though, strong, god, praises, in, part, his, superior, in, brief, god, is, inexpressible, to, the, son, for, he, is, in, himself, what, he, is, that, is, indescribable, so, that, the, son, does, not, comprehend, any, of, these, things, or, have, the, understanding, to, explain, them, for, it, is, impossible, for, him, to, fathom, the, father, who, is, by, himself, for, the, son, himself, does, not, even, know, his, own, essence, for, being, son, his, existence, is, most, certainly, at, the, will, of, the, father, what, reasoning, allows, that, he, who, is, from, the, father, should, comprehend, and, know, his, own, parent, for, clearly, that, which, has, a, beginning, is, not, able, to, conceive, of, or, grasp, the, existence, of, that, which, has, no, beginning, a, slightly, different, edition, of, the, fragment, of, the, thalia, from, de, synodis, is, given, by, g, c, stead, and, served, as, the, basis, for, a, translation, by, r, p, c, hanson, stead, argued, that, the, thalia, was, written, in, anapestic, meter, and, edited, the, fragment, to, show, what, it, would, look, like, in, anapests, with, different, line, breaks, hanson, based, his, translation, of, this, fragment, directly, on, stead, s, text
