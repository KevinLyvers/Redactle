late, 20th, century, wollstonecraft, s, life, which, encompassed, several, unconventional, at, the, time, personal, relationships, received, more, attention, than, her, writing, wollstonecraft, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, founding, feminist, philosophers, and, feminists, often, cite, both, her, life, and, her, works, as, important, influences, during, her, brief, career, she, wrote, novels, treatises, a, travel, narrative, a, history, of, the, french, revolution, a, conduct, book, and, a, children, s, book, wollstonecraft, is, best, known, for, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, 1792, in, which, she, argues, that, women, are, not, naturally, inferior, to, men, but, appear, to, be, only, because, they, lack, education, she, suggests, that, both, men, and, women, should, be, treated, as, rational, beings, and, imagines, a, social, order, founded, on, reason, after, two, ill, fated, affairs, with, henry, fuseli, and, gilbert, imlay, by, whom, she, had, a, daughter, fanny, imlay, wollstonecraft, married, the, philosopher, william, godwin, one, of, the, forefathers, of, the, anarchist, movement, wollstonecraft, died, at, the, age, of, 38, leaving, behind, several, unfinished, manuscripts, she, died, 11, days, after, giving, birth, to, her, second, daughter, mary, shelley, who, became, an, accomplished, writer, and, the, author, of, frankenstein, wollstonecraft, s, widower, published, a, memoir, 1798, of, her, life, revealing, her, unorthodox, lifestyle, which, inadvertently, destroyed, her, reputation, for, almost, a, century, however, with, the, emergence, of, the, feminist, movement, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, wollstonecraft, s, advocacy, of, women, s, equality, and, critiques, of, conventional, femininity, became, increasingly, important, wollstonecraft, was, born, on, 27, april, 1759, in, spitalfields, london, she, was, the, second, of, the, seven, children, of, elizabeth, dixon, and, edward, john, wollstonecraft, although, her, family, had, a, comfortable, income, when, she, was, a, child, her, father, gradually, squandered, it, on, speculative, projects, consequently, the, family, became, financially, unstable, and, they, were, frequently, forced, to, move, during, wollstonecraft, s, youth, the, family, s, financial, situation, eventually, became, so, dire, that, wollstonecraft, s, father, compelled, her, to, turn, over, money, that, she, would, have, inherited, at, her, maturity, moreover, he, was, apparently, a, violent, man, who, would, beat, his, wife, in, drunken, rages, as, a, teenager, wollstonecraft, used, to, lie, outside, the, door, of, her, mother, s, bedroom, to, protect, her, wollstonecraft, played, a, similar, maternal, role, for, her, sisters, everina, and, eliza, throughout, her, life, in, a, defining, moment, in, 1784, she, persuaded, eliza, who, was, suffering, from, what, was, probably, postpartum, depression, to, leave, her, husband, and, infant, wollstonecraft, made, all, of, the, arrangements, for, eliza, to, flee, demonstrating, her, willingness, to, challenge, social, norms, the, human, costs, however, were, severe, her, sister, suffered, social, condemnation, and, because, she, could, not, remarry, was, doomed, to, a, life, of, poverty, and, hard, work, two, friendships, shaped, wollstonecraft, s, early, life, the, first, was, with, jane, arden, in, beverley, the, two, frequently, read, books, together, and, attended, lectures, presented, by, arden, s, father, a, self, styled, philosopher, and, scientist, wollstonecraft, revelled, in, the, intellectual, atmosphere, of, the, arden, household, and, valued, her, friendship, with, arden, greatly, sometimes, to, the, point, of, being, emotionally, possessive, wollstonecraft, wrote, to, her, i, have, formed, romantic, notions, of, friendship, i, am, a, little, singular, in, my, thoughts, of, love, and, friendship, i, must, have, the, first, place, or, none, in, some, of, wollstonecraft, s, letters, to, arden, she, reveals, the, volatile, and, depressive, emotions, that, would, haunt, her, throughout, her, life, the, second, and, more, important, friendship, was, with, fanny, frances, blood, introduced, to, wollstonecraft, by, the, clares, a, couple, in, hoxton, who, became, parental, figures, to, her, wollstonecraft, credited, blood, with, opening, her, mind, unhappy, with, her, home, life, wollstonecraft, struck, out, on, her, own, in, 1778, and, accepted, a, job, as, a, lady, s, companion, to, sarah, dawson, a, widow, living, in, bath, however, wollstonecraft, had, trouble, getting, along, with, the, irascible, woman, an, experience, she, drew, on, when, describing, the, drawbacks, of, such, a, position, in, thoughts, on, the, education, of, daughters, 1787, in, 1780, she, returned, home, upon, being, called, back, to, care, for, her, dying, mother, rather, than, return, to, dawson, s, employ, after, the, death, of, her, mother, wollstonecraft, moved, in, with, the, bloods, she, realised, during, the, two, years, she, spent, with, the, family, that, she, had, idealised, blood, who, was, more, invested, in, traditional, feminine, values, than, was, wollstonecraft, but, wollstonecraft, remained, dedicated, to, fanny, and, her, family, throughout, her, life, frequently, giving, pecuniary, assistance, to, blood, s, brother, wollstonecraft, had, envisioned, living, in, a, female, utopia, with, blood, they, made, plans, to, rent, rooms, together, and, support, each, other, emotionally, and, financially, but, this, dream, collapsed, under, economic, realities, in, order, to, make, a, living, wollstonecraft, her, sisters, and, blood, set, up, a, school, together, in, newington, green, a, dissenting, community, blood, soon, became, engaged, and, after, her, marriage, moved, to, lisbon, portugal, with, her, husband, hugh, skeys, in, hopes, that, it, would, improve, her, health, which, had, always, been, precarious, despite, the, change, of, surroundings, blood, s, health, further, deteriorated, when, she, became, pregnant, and, in, 1785, wollstonecraft, left, the, school, and, followed, blood, to, nurse, her, but, to, no, avail, moreover, her, abandonment, of, the, school, led, to, its, failure, blood, s, death, devastated, wollstonecraft, and, was, part, of, the, inspiration, for, her, first, novel, mary, a, fiction, 1788, after, blood, s, death, in, 1785, wollstonecraft, s, friends, helped, her, obtain, a, position, as, governess, to, the, daughters, of, the, anglo, irish, kingsborough, family, in, ireland, although, she, could, not, get, along, with, lady, kingsborough, the, children, found, her, an, inspiring, instructor, one, of, the, daughters, margaret, king, would, later, say, she, had, freed, her, mind, from, all, superstitions, some, of, wollstonecraft, s, experiences, during, this, year, would, make, their, way, into, her, only, children, s, book, original, stories, from, real, life, 1788, frustrated, by, the, limited, career, options, open, to, respectable, yet, poor, women, an, impediment, which, wollstonecraft, eloquently, describes, in, the, chapter, of, thoughts, on, the, education, of, daughters, entitled, unfortunate, situation, of, females, fashionably, educated, and, left, without, a, fortune, she, decided, after, only, a, year, as, a, governess, to, embark, upon, a, career, as, an, author, this, was, a, radical, choice, since, at, the, time, few, women, could, support, themselves, by, writing, as, she, wrote, to, her, sister, everina, in, 1787, she, was, trying, to, become, the, first, of, a, new, genus, she, moved, to, london, and, assisted, by, the, liberal, publisher, joseph, johnson, found, a, place, to, live, and, work, to, support, herself, she, learned, french, and, german, and, translated, texts, most, notably, of, the, importance, of, religious, opinions, by, jacques, necker, and, elements, of, morality, for, the, use, of, children, by, christian, gotthilf, salzmann, she, also, wrote, reviews, primarily, of, novels, for, johnson, s, periodical, the, analytical, review, wollstonecraft, s, intellectual, universe, expanded, during, this, time, not, only, from, the, reading, that, she, did, for, her, reviews, but, also, from, the, company, she, kept, she, attended, johnson, s, famous, dinners, and, met, the, radical, pamphleteer, thomas, paine, and, the, philosopher, william, godwin, the, first, time, godwin, and, wollstonecraft, met, they, were, disappointed, in, each, other, godwin, had, come, to, hear, paine, but, wollstonecraft, assailed, him, all, night, long, disagreeing, with, him, on, nearly, every, subject, johnson, himself, however, became, much, more, than, a, friend, she, described, him, in, her, letters, as, a, father, and, a, brother, in, london, wollstonecraft, lived, on, dolben, street, in, southwark, an, up, and, coming, area, following, the, opening, of, the, first, blackfriars, bridge, in, 1769, while, in, london, she, formed, connections, with, members, of, the, blue, stockings, society, and, pursued, a, relationship, with, the, artist, henry, fuseli, even, though, he, was, already, married, she, was, she, wrote, enraptured, by, his, genius, the, grandeur, of, his, soul, that, quickness, of, comprehension, and, lovely, sympathy, she, proposed, a, platonic, living, arrangement, with, fuseli, and, his, wife, but, fuseli, s, wife, was, appalled, and, he, broke, off, the, relationship, with, wollstonecraft, after, fuseli, s, rejection, wollstonecraft, decided, to, travel, to, france, to, escape, the, humiliation, of, the, incident, and, to, participate, in, the, revolutionary, events, that, she, had, just, celebrated, in, her, recent, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, 1790, she, had, written, the, rights, of, men, in, response, to, the, whig, mp, edmund, burke, s, politically, conservative, critique, of, the, french, revolution, in, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, and, it, made, her, famous, overnight, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, was, published, on, 1, november, 1790, and, so, angered, wollstonecraft, that, she, spent, the, rest, of, the, month, writing, her, rebuttal, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, in, a, letter, to, the, right, honourable, edmund, burke, was, published, on, 29, november, 1790, initially, anonymously, the, second, edition, of, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, was, published, on, 18, december, and, this, time, the, publisher, revealed, wollstonecraft, as, the, author, wollstonecraft, called, the, french, revolution, a, glorious, chance, to, obtain, more, virtue, and, happiness, than, hitherto, blessed, our, globe, against, burke, s, dismissal, of, the, third, estate, as, men, of, no, account, wollstonecraft, wrote, time, may, show, that, this, obscure, throng, knew, more, of, the, human, heart, and, of, legislation, than, the, profligates, of, rank, emasculated, by, hereditary, effeminacy, about, the, events, of, 5, 6, october, 1789, when, the, royal, family, was, marched, from, versailles, to, paris, by, a, group, of, angry, housewives, burke, praised, queen, marie, antoinette, as, a, symbol, of, the, refined, elegance, of, the, ancien, r, gime, who, was, surrounded, by, furies, from, hell, in, the, abused, shape, of, the, vilest, of, women, wollstonecraft, by, contrast, wrote, of, the, same, event, probably, you, mean, women, who, gained, a, livelihood, by, selling, vegetables, or, fish, who, never, had, any, advantages, of, education, wollstonecraft, was, compared, with, such, leading, lights, as, the, theologian, and, controversialist, joseph, priestley, and, paine, whose, rights, of, man, 1791, would, prove, to, be, the, most, popular, of, the, responses, to, burke, she, pursued, the, ideas, she, had, outlined, in, rights, of, men, in, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, 1792, her, most, famous, and, influential, work, wollstonecraft, s, fame, extended, across, the, english, channel, for, when, the, french, statesmen, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, p, rigord, visited, london, in, 1792, he, visited, her, during, which, she, asked, that, french, girls, be, given, the, same, right, to, an, education, that, french, boys, were, being, offered, by, the, new, regime, in, france, wollstonecraft, left, for, paris, in, december, 1792, and, arrived, about, a, month, before, louis, xvi, was, guillotined, britain, and, france, were, on, the, brink, of, war, when, she, left, for, paris, and, many, advised, her, not, to, go, france, was, in, turmoil, she, sought, out, other, british, visitors, such, as, helen, maria, williams, and, joined, the, circle, of, expatriates, then, in, the, city, during, her, time, in, paris, wollstonecraft, associated, mostly, with, the, moderate, girondins, rather, than, the, more, radical, jacobins, it, was, indicative, that, when, archibald, hamilton, rowan, the, united, irishman, encountered, her, in, the, city, in, 1794, it, was, at, a, post, terror, festival, in, honour, of, the, moderate, revolutionary, leader, mirabeau, who, had, been, a, great, hero, for, irish, and, english, radicals, before, his, death, from, natural, causes, in, april, 1791, on, 26, december, 1792, wollstonecraft, saw, the, former, king, louis, xvi, being, taken, to, be, tried, before, the, national, assembly, and, much, to, her, own, surprise, found, the, tears, flow, insensibly, from, my, eyes, when, i, saw, louis, sitting, with, more, dignity, than, i, expected, from, his, character, in, a, hackney, coach, going, to, meet, death, where, so, many, of, his, race, have, triumphed, france, declared, war, on, britain, in, february, 1793, wollstonecraft, tried, to, leave, france, for, switzerland, but, was, denied, permission, the, jacobin, faction, increased, in, power, and, in, march, the, formation, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, and, the, revolutionary, tribunal, were, symptomatic, of, an, increasingly, totalitarian, regime, life, became, very, difficult, for, foreigners, in, france, at, first, they, were, put, under, police, surveillance, and, to, get, a, residency, permit, had, to, produce, six, written, statements, from, frenchmen, testifying, to, their, loyalty, to, the, republic, then, on, 12, april, 1793, all, foreigners, were, forbidden, to, leave, france, despite, her, sympathy, for, the, revolution, life, for, wollstonecraft, become, very, uncomfortable, all, the, more, so, as, the, girondins, had, lost, out, to, the, jacobins, some, of, wollstonecraft, s, french, friends, lost, their, heads, to, the, guillotine, as, the, jacobins, set, out, to, annihilate, their, enemies, having, just, written, the, rights, of, woman, wollstonecraft, was, determined, to, put, her, ideas, to, the, test, and, in, the, stimulating, intellectual, atmosphere, of, the, french, revolution, she, attempted, her, most, experimental, romantic, attachment, yet, she, met, and, fell, passionately, in, love, with, gilbert, imlay, an, american, adventurer, wollstonecraft, put, her, own, principles, in, practice, by, sleeping, with, imlay, even, though, they, were, not, married, which, was, unacceptable, behaviour, from, a, respectable, british, woman, whether, or, not, she, was, interested, in, marriage, he, was, not, and, she, appears, to, have, fallen, in, love, with, an, idealisation, of, the, man, despite, her, rejection, of, the, sexual, component, of, relationships, in, the, rights, of, woman, wollstonecraft, discovered, that, imlay, awakened, her, interest, in, sex, wollstonecraft, was, to, a, certain, extent, disillusioned, by, what, she, saw, in, france, writing, that, the, people, under, the, republic, still, behaved, slavishly, to, those, who, held, power, while, the, government, remained, venal, and, brutal, despite, her, disenchantment, wollstonecraft, wrote, i, cannot, yet, give, up, the, hope, that, a, fairer, day, is, dawning, on, europe, though, i, must, hesitatingly, observe, that, little, is, to, be, expected, from, the, narrow, principle, of, commerce, which, seems, everywhere, to, be, shoving, aside, the, point, of, honour, of, the, noblesse, for, the, same, pride, of, office, the, same, desire, of, power, are, still, visible, with, this, aggravation, that, fearing, to, return, to, obscurity, after, having, but, just, acquired, a, relish, for, distinction, each, hero, or, philosopher, for, all, are, dubbed, with, these, new, titles, endeavors, to, make, hay, while, the, sun, shines, wollstonecraft, was, offended, by, the, jacobins, treatment, of, women, they, refused, to, grant, women, equal, rights, denounced, amazons, and, made, it, clear, that, women, were, supposed, to, conform, to, jean, jacques, rousseau, s, ideal, of, helpers, to, men, on, 16, october, 1793, marie, antoinette, was, guillotined, among, her, charges, and, convictions, she, was, found, guilty, of, committing, incest, with, her, son, though, wollstonecraft, disliked, the, former, queen, she, was, troubled, that, the, jacobins, would, make, marie, antoinette, s, alleged, perverse, sexual, acts, one, of, the, central, reasons, for, the, french, people, to, hate, her, as, the, daily, arrests, and, executions, of, the, reign, of, terror, began, wollstonecraft, came, under, suspicion, she, was, after, all, a, british, citizen, known, to, be, a, friend, of, leading, girondins, on, 31, october, 1793, most, of, the, girondin, leaders, were, guillotined, when, imlay, broke, the, news, to, wollstonecraft, she, fainted, by, this, time, imlay, was, taking, advantage, of, the, british, blockade, of, france, which, had, caused, shortages, and, worsened, ever, growing, inflation, by, chartering, ships, to, bring, food, and, soap, from, america, and, dodge, the, british, royal, navy, goods, that, he, could, sell, at, a, premium, to, frenchmen, who, still, had, money, imlay, s, blockade, running, gained, the, respect, and, support, of, some, jacobins, ensuring, as, he, had, hoped, his, freedom, during, the, terror, to, protect, wollstonecraft, from, arrest, imlay, made, a, false, statement, to, the, u, s, embassy, in, paris, that, he, had, married, her, automatically, making, her, an, american, citizen, some, of, her, friends, were, not, so, lucky, many, were, arrested, her, sisters, believed, she, had, been, imprisoned, wollstonecraft, called, life, under, the, jacobins, nightmarish, there, were, gigantic, daytime, parades, requiring, everyone, to, show, themselves, and, lustily, cheer, lest, they, be, suspected, of, inadequate, commitment, to, the, republic, as, well, as, nighttime, police, raids, to, arrest, enemies, of, the, republic, in, a, march, 1794, letter, to, her, sister, everina, wollstonecraft, wrote, it, is, impossible, for, you, to, have, any, idea, of, the, impression, the, sad, scenes, i, have, been, a, witness, to, have, left, on, my, mind, death, and, misery, in, every, shape, of, terrour, haunts, this, devoted, country, i, certainly, am, glad, that, i, came, to, france, because, i, never, could, have, had, else, a, just, opinion, of, the, most, extraordinary, event, that, has, ever, been, recorded, wollstonecraft, soon, became, pregnant, by, imlay, and, on, 14, may, 1794, she, gave, birth, to, her, first, child, fanny, naming, her, after, perhaps, her, closest, friend, wollstonecraft, was, overjoyed, she, wrote, to, a, friend, my, little, girl, begins, to, suck, so, manfully, that, her, father, reckons, saucily, on, her, writing, the, second, part, of, the, r, ts, of, woman, emphasis, hers, she, continued, to, write, avidly, despite, not, only, her, pregnancy, and, the, burdens, of, being, a, new, mother, alone, in, a, foreign, country, but, also, the, growing, tumult, of, the, french, revolution, while, at, le, havre, in, northern, france, she, wrote, a, history, of, the, early, revolution, an, historical, and, moral, view, of, the, french, revolution, which, was, published, in, london, in, december, 1794, imlay, unhappy, with, the, domestic, minded, and, maternal, wollstonecraft, eventually, left, her, he, promised, that, he, would, return, to, her, and, fanny, at, le, havre, but, his, delays, in, writing, to, her, and, his, long, absences, convinced, wollstonecraft, that, he, had, found, another, woman, her, letters, to, him, are, full, of, needy, expostulations, which, most, critics, explain, as, the, expressions, of, a, deeply, depressed, woman, while, others, say, they, resulted, from, her, circumstances, a, foreign, woman, alone, with, an, infant, in, the, middle, of, a, revolution, that, had, seen, good, friends, imprisoned, or, executed, in, july, 1794, wollstonecraft, welcomed, the, fall, of, the, jacobins, predicting, it, would, be, followed, with, a, restoration, of, freedom, of, the, press, in, france, which, led, her, to, return, to, paris, in, august, 1794, imlay, departed, for, london, and, promised, to, return, soon, in, 1793, the, british, government, had, begun, a, crackdown, on, radicals, suspending, civil, liberties, imposing, drastic, censorship, and, trying, for, treason, anyone, suspected, of, sympathy, with, the, revolution, which, led, wollstonecraft, to, fear, she, would, be, imprisoned, if, she, returned, the, winter, of, 1794, 95, was, the, coldest, winter, in, europe, for, over, a, century, which, reduced, wollstonecraft, and, her, daughter, fanny, to, desperate, circumstances, the, river, seine, froze, that, winter, which, made, it, impossible, for, ships, to, bring, food, and, coal, to, paris, leading, to, widespread, starvation, and, deaths, from, the, cold, in, the, city, wollstonecraft, continued, to, write, to, imlay, asking, him, to, return, to, france, at, once, declaring, she, still, had, faith, in, the, revolution, and, did, not, wish, to, return, to, britain, after, she, left, france, on, 7, april, 1795, she, continued, to, refer, to, herself, as, mrs, imlay, even, to, her, sisters, in, order, to, bestow, legitimacy, upon, her, child, the, british, historian, tom, furniss, called, an, historical, and, moral, view, of, the, french, revolution, the, most, neglected, of, wollstonecraft, s, books, it, was, first, published, in, london, in, 1794, but, a, second, edition, did, not, appear, until, 1989, later, generations, were, more, interested, in, her, feminist, writings, than, in, her, account, of, the, french, revolution, which, furniss, has, called, her, best, work, wollstonecraft, was, not, trained, as, a, historian, but, she, used, all, sorts, of, journals, letters, and, documents, recounting, how, ordinary, people, in, france, reacted, to, the, revolution, she, was, trying, to, counteract, what, furniss, called, the, hysterical, anti, revolutionary, mood, in, britain, which, depicted, the, revolution, as, due, to, the, entire, french, nation, s, going, mad, wollstonecraft, argued, instead, that, the, revolution, arose, from, a, set, of, social, economic, and, political, conditions, that, left, no, other, way, out, of, the, crisis, that, gripped, france, in, 1789, an, historical, and, moral, view, of, the, french, revolution, was, a, difficult, balancing, act, for, wollstonecraft, she, condemned, the, jacobin, regime, and, the, reign, of, terror, but, at, same, time, she, argued, that, the, revolution, was, a, great, achievement, which, led, her, to, stop, her, history, in, late, 1789, rather, than, write, about, the, terror, of, 1793, 94, edmund, burke, had, ended, his, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, with, reference, to, the, events, of, 5, 6, october, 1789, when, a, group, of, women, from, paris, forced, the, french, royal, family, from, the, palace, of, versailles, to, paris, burke, called, the, women, furies, from, hell, while, wollstonecraft, defended, them, as, ordinary, housewives, angry, about, the, lack, of, bread, to, feed, their, families, against, burke, s, idealised, portrait, of, marie, antoinette, as, a, noble, victim, of, a, mob, wollstonecraft, portrayed, the, queen, as, a, femme, fatale, a, seductive, scheming, and, dangerous, woman, wollstonecraft, argued, that, the, values, of, the, aristocracy, corrupted, women, in, a, monarchy, because, women, s, main, purpose, in, such, a, society, was, to, bear, sons, to, continue, a, dynasty, which, essentially, reduced, a, woman, s, value, to, only, her, womb, moreover, wollstonecraft, pointed, out, that, unless, a, queen, was, a, queen, regnant, most, queens, were, queen, consorts, which, meant, a, woman, had, to, exercise, influence, via, her, husband, or, son, encouraging, her, to, become, more, and, more, manipulative, wollstonecraft, argued, that, aristocratic, values, by, emphasising, a, woman, s, body, and, her, ability, to, be, charming, over, her, mind, and, character, had, encouraged, women, like, marie, antoinette, to, be, manipulative, and, ruthless, making, the, queen, into, a, corrupted, and, corrupting, product, of,

declamations, and, took, particular, offense, at, her, depiction, of, louis, xvi, seeking, imlay, wollstonecraft, returned, to, london, in, april, 1795, but, he, rejected, her, in, may, 1795, she, attempted, to, commit, suicide, probably, with, laudanum, but, imlay, saved, her, life, although, it, is, unclear, how, in, a, last, attempt, to, win, back, imlay, she, embarked, upon, some, business, negotiations, for, him, in, scandinavia, trying, to, locate, a, norwegian, captain, who, had, absconded, with, silver, that, imlay, was, trying, to, get, past, the, british, blockade, of, france, wollstonecraft, undertook, this, hazardous, trip, with, only, her, young, daughter, and, marguerite, her, maid, she, recounted, her, travels, and, thoughts, in, letters, to, imlay, many, of, which, were, eventually, published, as, letters, written, during, a, short, residence, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, in, 1796, when, she, returned, to, england, and, came, to, the, full, realisation, that, her, relationship, with, imlay, was, over, she, attempted, suicide, for, the, second, time, leaving, a, note, for, imlay, let, my, wrongs, sleep, with, me, soon, very, soon, shall, i, be, at,

literary, life, becoming, involved, with, joseph, johnson, s, circle, again, in, particular, with, mary, hays, elizabeth, inchbald, and, sarah, siddons, through, william, godwin, godwin, and, wollstonecraft, s, unique, courtship, began, slowly, but, it, eventually, became, a, passionate, love, affair, godwin, had, read, her, letters, written, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, and, later, wrote, that, if, ever, there, was, a, book, calculated, to, make, a, man, in, love, with, its, author, this, appears, to, me, to, be, the, book, she, speaks, of, her, sorrows, in, a, way, that, fills, us, with, melancholy, and, dissolves, us, in, tenderness, at, the, same, time, that, she, displays, a, genius, which, commands, all, our, admiration, once, wollstonecraft, became, pregnant, they, decided, to, marry, so, that, their, child, would, be, legitimate, their, marriage, revealed, the, fact, that, wollstonecraft, had, never, been, married, to, imlay, and, as, a, result, she, and, godwin, lost, many, friends, godwin, was, further, criticised, because, he, had, advocated, the, abolition, of, marriage, in, his, philosophical, treatise, political, justice, after, their, marriage, on, 29, march, 1797, godwin, and, wollstonecraft, moved, to, 29, the, polygon, somers, town, godwin, rented, an, apartment, 20, doors, away, at, 17, evesham, buildings, in, chalton, street, as, a,

30, august, 1797, wollstonecraft, gave, birth, to, her, second, daughter, mary, although, the, delivery, seemed, to, go, well, initially, the, placenta, broke, apart, during, the, birth, and, became, infected, childbed, fever, post, partum, infection, was, a, common, and, often, fatal, occurrence, in, the, 18th, century, after, several, days, of, agony, wollstonecraft, died, of, septicaemia, on, 10, september, godwin, was, devastated, he, wrote, to, his, friend, thomas, holcroft, i, firmly, believe, there, does, not, exist, her, equal, in, the, world, i, know, from, experience, we, were, formed, to, make, each, other, happy, i, have, not, the, least, expectation, that, i, can, now, ever, know, happiness, again, she, was, buried, in, the, churchyard, of, st, pancras, old, church,

published, his, memoirs, of, the, author, of, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, although, godwin, felt, that, he, was, portraying, his, wife, with, love, compassion, and, sincerity, many, readers, were, shocked, that, he, would, reveal, wollstonecraft, s, illegitimate, children, love, affairs, and, suicide, attempts, the, romantic, poet, robert, southey, accused, him, of, the, want, of, all, feeling, in, stripping, his, dead, wife, naked, and, vicious, satires, such, as, the, unsex, d, females, were, published, godwin, s, memoirs, portrays, wollstonecraft, as, a, woman, deeply, invested, in, feeling, who, was, balanced, by, his, reason, and, as, more, of, a, religious, sceptic, than, her, own, writings, suggest, godwin, s, views, of, wollstonecraft, were, perpetuated, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, and, resulted, in, poems, such, as, wollstonecraft, and, fuseli, by, british, poet, robert, browning, and, that, by, william, roscoe, which, includes, the, lines, hard, was, thy, fate, in, all, the, scenes, of, life, as, daughter, sister, mother, friend, and, wife, but, harder, still, thy, fate, in, death, we, own, thus, mourn, d, by, godwin, with, a, heart,

what, scholar, cora, kaplan, labelled, in, 2002, a, curious, legacy, that, has, evolved, over, time, for, an, author, activist, adept, in, many, genres, up, until, the, last, quarter, century, wollstonecraft, s, life, has, been, read, much, more, closely, than, her, writing, after, the, devastating, effect, of, godwin, s, memoirs, wollstonecraft, s, reputation, lay, in, tatters, for, nearly, a, century, she, was, pilloried, by, such, writers, as, maria, edgeworth, who, patterned, the, freakish, harriet, freke, in, belinda, 1801, after, her, other, novelists, such, as, mary, hays, charlotte, smith, fanny, burney, and, jane, west, created, similar, figures, all, to, teach, a, moral, lesson, to, their, readers, hays, had, been, a, close, friend, and, helped, nurse, her, in, her, dying, days, however, the, author, mary, robinson, who, was, associated, with, both, godwin, and, wollstonecraft, is, noted, for, her, support, and, admiration, for, wollstonecraft, even, amidst, the, controversy, of, godwin, s, biography, in, her, 1799, pamphlet, thoughts, on, the, condition, of, women, robinson, describes, wollstonecraft, as, an, illustrious, british, female, whose, death, has, not, been, sufficiently, lamented, but, to, whose, genius, posterity, will, render, justice, the, poet, anna, seward, admired, wollstonecraft, and, was, largely, positive, towards, godwin, s, memoirs, writing, in, 1798, bearing, strong, marks, of, impartial, authenticity, as, to, the, character, sentiments, conduct, and, destiny, of, a, very, extraordinary, woman, they, appear, to, be, highly, valuable, jane, austen, never, mentioned, the, earlier, woman, by, name, but, several, of, her, novels, contain, positive, allusions, to, wollstonecraft, s, work, the, american, literary, scholar, anne, k, mellor, notes, several, examples, in, pride, and, prejudice, mr, wickham, seems, to, be, based, upon, the, sort, of, man, wollstonecraft, claimed, that, standing, armies, produce, while, the, sarcastic, remarks, of, protagonist, elizabeth, bennet, about, female, accomplishments, closely, echo, wollstonecraft, s, condemnation, of, these, activities, and, when, mr, collins, will, not, believe, her, refusal, to, his, proposal, of, marriage, an, exasperated, elizabeth, tells, him, do, not, consider, me, now, as, an, elegant, female, intending, to, plague, you, but, as, a, rational, creature, speaking, the, truth, from, her, heart, as, chloe, rojas, writes, using, wollstonecraft, s, idea, of, women, being, rational, creatures, austen, s, underlying, theme, of, women, being, intelligent, though, different, than, men, and, having, the, ability, to, learn, and, be, educated, is, what, lies, behind, her, plot, the, balance, a, woman, must, strike, between, feelings, and, reason, in, sense, and, sensibility, follows, what, wollstonecraft, recommended, in, her, novel, mary, while, the, moral, equivalence, austen, drew, in, mansfield, park, between, slavery, and, the, treatment, of, women, in, society, back, home, tracks, one, of, wollstonecraft, s, favourite, arguments, in, persuasion, austen, s, characterisation, of, anne, eliot, as, well, as, her, late, mother, before, her, as, better, qualified, than, her, father, to, manage, the, family, estate, also, echoes, a, wollstonecraft, thesis, scholar, virginia, sapiro, states, that, few, read, wollstonecraft, s, works, during, the, nineteenth, century, as, her, attackers, implied, or, stated, that, no, self, respecting, woman, would, read, her, work, still, as, craciun, points, out, new, editions, of, rights, of, woman, appeared, in, the, uk, in, the, 1840s, and, in, the, us, in, the, 1830s, 1840s, and, 1850s, if, readers, were, few, then, many, were, inspired, one, such, reader, was, elizabeth, barrett, browning, who, read, rights, of, woman, at, age, 12, and, whose, poem, aurora, leigh, reflected, wollstonecraft, s, unwavering, focus, on, education, lucretia, mott, a, quaker, minister, and, elizabeth, cady, stanton, americans, who, met, in, 1840, at, the, world, anti, slavery, convention, in, london, discovered, they, both, had, read, wollstonecraft, and, they, agreed, upon, the, need,

wollstonecraft, a, commemorative, sculpture, a, sculpture, for, mary, wollstonecraft, by, maggi, hambling, was, unveiled, on, 10, november, 2020, it, was, criticised, for, its, symbolic, depiction, rather, than, a, lifelike, representation, of, wollstonecraft, which, commentators, felt, represented, stereotypical, notions, of, beauty, and, the, diminishing, of, women, in, november, 2020, it, was, announced, that, trinity, college, dublin, whose, library, had, previously, held, forty, busts, all, of, them, of, men, was, commissioning, four, new, busts, of, women, one, of, whom, would, be, wollstonecraft, the, majority, of, wollstonecraft, s, early, productions, are, about, education, she, assembled, an, anthology, of, literary, extracts, for, the, improvement, of, young, women, entitled, the, female, reader, and, she, translated, two, children, s, works, maria, geertruida, van, de, werken, de, cambon, s, young, grandison, and, christian, gotthilf, salzmann, s, elements, of,

life, 1788, wollstonecraft, advocates, educating, children, into, the, emerging, middle, class, ethos, self, discipline, honesty, frugality, and, social, contentment, both, books, also, emphasise, the, importance, of, teaching, children, to, reason, revealing, wollstonecraft, s, intellectual, debt, to, the, educational, views, of, seventeenth, century, philosopher, john, locke, however, the, prominence, she, affords, religious, faith, and, innate, feeling, distinguishes, her, work, from, his, and, links, it, to, the, discourse, of, sensibility, popular, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, both, texts, also, advocate, the, education, of, women, a, controversial, topic, at, the, time, and, one, which, she, would, return, to, throughout, her, career, most, notably, in, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, wollstonecraft, argues, that, well, educated, women, will, be, good, wives, and, mothers, and, ultimately, contribute, positively, to, the, nation, published, in, response, to, edmund, burke, s, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, which, was, a, defence, of, constitutional, monarchy, aristocracy, and, the, church, of, england, and, an, attack, on, wollstonecraft, s, friend, the, rev, richard, price, at, the, newington, green, unitarian, church, wollstonecraft, s, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, 1790, attacks, aristocracy, and, advocates, republicanism, hers, was, the, first, response, in, a, pamphlet, war, that, subsequently, became, known, as, the, revolution, controversy, in, which, thomas, paine, s, rights, of, man, 1792, became, the, rallying, cry, for, reformers, and, radicals, wollstonecraft, attacked, not, only, monarchy, and, hereditary, privilege, but, also, the, language, that, burke, used, to, defend, and, elevate, it, in, a, famous, passage, in, the, reflections, burke, had, lamented, i, had, thought, ten, thousand, swords, must, have, leaped, from, their, scabbards, to, avenge, even, a, look, that, threatened, her, with, insult, but, the, age, of, chivalry, is, gone, most, of, burke, s, detractors, deplored, what, they, viewed, as, theatrical, pity, for, the, french, queen, a, pity, they, felt, was, at, the, expense, of, the, people, wollstonecraft, was, unique, in, her, attack, on, burke, s, gendered, language, by, redefining, the, sublime, and, the, beautiful, terms, first, established, by, burke, himself, in, a, philosophical, enquiry, into, the, origin, of, our, ideas, of, the, sublime, and, beautiful, 1756, she, undermined, his, rhetoric, as, well, as, his, argument, burke, had, associated, the, beautiful, with, weakness, and, femininity, and, the, sublime, with, strength, and, masculinity, wollstonecraft, turns, these, definitions, against, him, arguing, that, his, theatrical, tableaux, turn, burke, s, readers, the, citizens, into, weak, women, who, are, swayed, by, show, in, her, first, unabashedly, feminist, critique, which, wollstonecraft, scholar, claudia, l, johnson, argues, remains, unsurpassed, in, its, argumentative, force, wollstonecraft, indicts, burke, s, defence, of, an, unequal, society, founded, on, the, passivity, of, women, in, her, arguments, for, republican, virtue, wollstonecraft, invokes, an, emerging, middle, class, ethos, in, opposition, to, what, she, views, as, the, vice, ridden, aristocratic, code, of, manners, influenced, by, enlightenment, thinkers, she, believed, in, progress, and, derides, burke, for, relying, on, tradition, and, custom, she, argues, for, rationality, pointing, out, that, burke, s, system, would, lead, to, the, continuation, of, slavery, simply, because, it, had, been, an, ancestral, tradition, she, describes, an, idyllic, country, life, in, which, each, family, can, have, a, farm, that, will, just, suit, its, needs, wollstonecraft, contrasts, her, utopian, picture, of, society, drawn, with, what, she, says, is, genuine, feeling, to, burke, s, false, feeling, the, rights, of, men, was, wollstonecraft, s, first, overtly, political, work, as, well, as, her, first, feminist, work, as, johnson, contends, it, seems, that, in, the, act, of, writing, the, later, portions, of, rights, of, men, she, discovered, the, subject, that, would, preoccupy, her, for, the, rest, of, her, career, it, was, this, text, that, made, her, a, well, known, writer, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, is, one, of, the, earliest, works, of, feminist, philosophy, in, it, wollstonecraft, argues, that, women, ought, to, have, an, education, commensurate, with, their, position, in, society, and, then, proceeds, to, redefine, that, position, claiming, that, women, are, essential, to, the, nation, because, they, educate, its, children, and, because, they, could, be, companions, to, their, husbands, rather, than, mere, wives, instead, of, viewing, women, as, ornaments, to, society, or, property, to, be, traded, in, marriage, wollstonecraft, maintains, that, they, are, human, beings, deserving, of, the, same, fundamental, rights, as, men, large, sections, of, the, rights, of, woman, respond, vitriolically, to, conduct, book, writers, such, as, james, fordyce, and, john, gregory, and, educational, philosophers, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, wanted, to, deny, women, an, education, rousseau, famously, argues, in, mile, 1762, that, women, should, be, educated, for, the, pleasure, of, men, wollstonecraft, states, that, currently, many, women, are, silly, and, superficial, she, refers, to, them, for, example, as, spaniels, and, toys, but, argues, that, this, is, not, because, of, an, innate, deficiency, of, mind, but, rather, because, men, have, denied, them, access, to, education, wollstonecraft, is, intent, on, illustrating, the, limitations, that, women, s, deficient, educations, have, placed, on, them, she, writes, taught, from, their, infancy, that, beauty, is, woman, s, sceptre, the, mind, shapes, itself, to, the, body, and, roaming, round, its, gilt, cage, only, seeks, to, adorn, its, prison, she, implies, that, without, the, encouragement, young, women, receive, from, an, early, age, to, focus, their, attention, on, beauty, and, outward, accomplishments, women, could, achieve, much, more, while, wollstonecraft, does, call, for, equality, between, the, sexes, in, particular, areas, of, life, such, as, morality, she, does, not, explicitly, state, that, men, and, women, are, equal, what, she, does, claim, is, that, men, and, women, are, equal, in, the, eyes, of, god, however, such, claims, of, equality, stand, in, contrast, to, her, statements, respecting, the, superiority, of, masculine, strength, and, valour, wollstonecraft, famously, and, ambiguously, writes, let, it, not, be, concluded, that, i, wish, to, invert, the, order, of, things, i, have, already, granted, that, from, the, constitution, of, their, bodies, men, seem, to, be, designed, by, providence, to, attain, a, greater, degree, of, virtue, i, speak, collectively, of, the, whole, sex, but, i, see, not, the, shadow, of, a, reason, to, conclude, that, their, virtues, should, differ, in, respect, to, their, nature, in, fact, how, can, they, if, virtue, has, only, one, eternal, standard, i, must, therefore, if, i, reason, consequently, as, strenuously, maintain, that, they, have, the, same, simple, direction, as, that, there, is, a, god, her, ambiguous, statements, regarding, the, equality, of, the, sexes, have, since, made, it, difficult, to, classify, wollstonecraft, as, a, modern, feminist, particularly, since, the, word, did, not, come, into, existence, until, the, 1890s, one, of, wollstonecraft, s, most, scathing, critiques, in, the, rights, of, woman, is, of, false, and, excessive, sensibility, particularly, in, women, she, argues, that, women, who, succumb, to, sensibility, are, blown, about, by, every, momentary, gust, of, feeling, and, because, they, are, the, prey, of, their, senses, they, cannot, think, rationally, in, fact, she, claims, they, do, harm, not, only, to, themselves, but, to, the, entire, civilisation, these, are, not, women, who, can, help, refine, a, civilisation, a, popular, eighteenth, century, idea, but, women, who, will, destroy, it, wollstonecraft, does, not, argue, that, reason, and, feeling, should, act, independently, of, each, other, rather, she, believes, that, they, should, inform, each, other, in, addition, to, her, larger, philosophical, arguments, wollstonecraft, also, lays, out, a, specific, educational, plan, in, the, twelfth, chapter, of, the, rights, of, woman, on, national, education, she, argues, that, all, children, should, be, sent, to, a, country, day, school, as, well, as, given, some, education, at, home, to, inspire, a, love, of, home, and, domestic, pleasures, she, also, maintains, that, schooling, should, be, co, educational, arguing, that, men, and, women, whose, marriages, are, the, cement, of, society, should, be, educated, after, the, same, model, wollstonecraft, addresses, her, text, to, the, middle, class, which, she, describes, as, the, most, natural, state, and, in, many, ways, the, rights, of, woman, is, inflected, by, a, bourgeois, view, of, the, world, it, encourages, modesty, and, industry, in, its, readers, and, attacks, the, uselessness, of, the, aristocracy, but, wollstonecraft, is, not, necessarily, a, friend, to, the, poor, for, example, in, her, national, plan, for, education, she, suggests, that, after, the, age, of, nine, the, poor, except, for, those, who, are, brilliant, should, be, separated, from, the, rich, and, taught, in, another, school, both, of, wollstonecraft, s, novels, criticise, what, she, viewed, as, the, patriarchal, institution, of, marriage, and, its, deleterious, effects, on, women, in, her, first, novel, mary, a, fiction, 1788, the, eponymous, heroine, is, forced, into, a, loveless, marriage, for, economic, reasons, she, fulfils, her, desire, for, love, and, affection, outside, marriage, with, two, passionate, romantic, friendships, one, with, a, woman, and, one, with, a, man, maria, or, the, wrongs, of, woman, 1798, an, unfinished, novel, published, posthumously, and, often, considered, wollstonecraft, s, most, radical, feminist, work, revolves, around, the, story, of, a, woman, imprisoned, in, an, insane, asylum, by, her, husband, like, mary, maria, also, finds, fulfilment, outside, of, marriage, in, an, affair, with, a, fellow, inmate, and, a, friendship, with, one, of, her, keepers, neither, of, wollstonecraft, s, novels, depict, successful, marriages, although, she, posits, such, relationships, in, the, rights, of, woman, at, the, end, of, mary, the, heroine, believes, she, is, going, to, that, world, where, there, is, neither, marrying, nor, giving, in, marriage, presumably, a, positive, state, of, affairs, both, of, wollstonecraft, s, novels, also, critique, the, discourse, of, sensibility, a, moral, philosophy, and, aesthetic, that, had, become, popular, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, mary, is, itself, a, novel, of, sensibility, and, wollstonecraft, attempts, to, use, the, tropes, of, that, genre, to, undermine, sentimentalism, itself, a, philosophy, she, believed, was, damaging, to, women, because, it, encouraged, them, to, rely, overmuch, on, their, emotions, in, the, wrongs, of, woman, the, heroine, s, indulgence, on, romantic, fantasies, fostered, by, novels, themselves, is, depicted, as, particularly, detrimental, female, friendships, are, central, to, both, of, wollstonecraft, s, novels, but, it, is, the, friendship, between, maria, and, jemima, the, servant, charged, with, watching, over, her, in, the, insane, asylum, that, is, the, most, historically, significant, this, friendship, based, on, a, sympathetic, bond, of, motherhood, between, an, upper, class, woman, and, a, lower, class, woman, is, one, of, the, first, moments, in, the, history, of, feminist, literature, that, hints, at, a, cross, class, argument, that, is, that, women, of, different, economic, positions, have, the, same, interests, because, they, are, women, wollstonecraft, s, letters, written, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, is, a, deeply, personal, travel, narrative, the, 25, letters, cover, a, wide, range, of, topics, from, sociological, reflections, on, scandinavia, and, its, peoples, to, philosophical, questions, regarding, identity, to, musings, on, her, relationship, with, imlay, although, he, is, not, referred, to, by, name, in, the, text, using, the, rhetoric, of, the, sublime, wollstonecraft, explores, the, relationship, between, the, self, and, society, reflecting, the, strong, influence, of, rousseau, letters, written, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, shares, the, themes, of, the, french, philosopher, s, reveries, of, a, solitary, walker, 1782, the, search, for, the, source, of, human, happiness, the, stoic, rejection, of, material, goods, the, ecstatic, embrace, of, nature, and, the, essential, role, of, sentiment, in, understanding, while, rousseau, ultimately, rejects, society, however, wollstonecraft, celebrates, domestic, scenes, and, industrial, progress, in, her, text, wollstonecraft, promotes, subjective, experience, particularly, in, relation, to, nature, exploring, the, connections, between, the, sublime, and, sensibility, many, of, the, letters, describe, the, breathtaking, scenery, of, scandinavia, and, wollstonecraft, s, desire, to, create, an, emotional, connection, to, that, natural, world, in, so, doing, she, gives, greater, value, to, the, imagination, than, she, had, in, previous, works, as, in, her, previous, writings, she, champions, the, liberation, and, education, of, women, in, a, change, from, her, earlier, works, however, she, illustrates, the, detrimental, effects, of, commerce, on, society, contrasting, the, imaginative, connection, to, the, world, with, a, commercial, and, mercenary, one, an, attitude, she, associates, with, imlay, letters, written, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, was, wollstonecraft, s, most, popular, book, in, the, 1790s, it, sold, well, and, was, reviewed, positively, by, most, critics, godwin, wrote, if, ever, there, was, a, book, calculated, to, make, a, man, in, love, with, its, author, this, appears, to, me, to, be, the, book, it, influenced, romantic, poets, such, as, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, who, drew, on, its, themes, and, its, aesthetic, this, is, a, complete, list, of, mary, wollstonecraft, s, works, all, works, are, the, first, edition,
