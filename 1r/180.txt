he, had, been, invited, in, 1502, and, 1505, respectively, by, the, sublime, porte, to, submit, plans, for, a, bridge, spanning, the, golden, horn, mimar, sinan, s, works, are, among, the, most, influential, buildings, in, history, mimar, sinan, was, born, with, the, name, joseph, in, a, small, town, called, a, rnas, near, the, city, of, kayseri, in, anatolia, as, stated, in, an, order, by, sultan, selim, ii, his, birth, is, variously, placed, either, between, 1489, and, 1491, or, between, 1494, and, 1499, his, origin, is, disputed, mainly, between, armenian, and, cappadocian, greek, one, argument, that, lends, credence, to, his, armenian, or, greek, background, is, a, decree, by, selim, ii, dated, ramadan, 7, 981, ca, december, 30, 1573, which, granted, sinan, s, request, to, forgive, and, spare, his, relatives, from, the, general, exile, of, kayseri, s, armenian, community, to, the, island, of, cyprus, this, decree, was, published, in, the, june, 1930, may, 1931, edition, of, the, istanbul, turkish, journal, t, rk, tarihi, enc, meni, mecmuas, godfrey, goodwin, stated, that, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, cyprus, in, 1571, when, selim, ii, decided, to, repopulate, the, island, by, transferring, rum, orthodox, christian, families, from, the, karaman, eyalet, sinan, intervened, on, behalf, of, his, family, and, obtained, two, orders, from, the, sultan, in, council, exempting, them, from, deportation, according, to, several, scholars, this, means, that, his, family, was, cappadocian, greek, because, the, only, orthodox, christians, r, ms, of, the, region, were, greek, speaking, sinan, s, place, of, birth, a, rnas, was, a, greek, village, with, no, armenian, inhabitants, which, some, scholars, argue, would, give, more, credence, to, the, theory, of, him, being, of, greek, origin, additionally, before, the, greeks, evacuated, the, village, a, cappadocian, greek, family, from, the, village, named, ta, o, lu, greek, had, claimed, sinan, as, a, member, of, their, own, family, less, popular, theories, among, scholars, are, that, sinan, was, albanian, or, even, jewish, or, christian, turkish, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, sinan, had, either, armenian, or, greek, origin, a, local, tradition, in, the, village, of, shiroka, l, ka, holds, that, sinan, was, of, bulgarian, origin, and, his, family, came, from, that, village, turkish, scholars, have, meanwhile, argued, that, sinan, s, family, was, christian, turkish, in, 1935, a, council, commissioned, by, the, turkish, historical, society, went, so, far, as, to, open, up, sinan, s, tomb, and, measure, his, skull, so, as, demonstrate, his, turkish, racial, heritage, sinan, grew, up, helping, his, father, in, his, work, and, by, the, time, that, he, was, conscripted,

empire, he, was, also, responsible, for, the, design, and, construction, of, public, works, such, as, roads, waterworks, and, bridges, through, the, years, he, transformed, his, office, into, that, of, architect, of, the, empire, an, elaborate, government, department, with, greater, powers, than, his, supervising, minister, he, became, the, head, of, a, whole, corps, of, architects, training, a, team, of, assistants, deputies, and, pupils, his, training, as, an, army, engineer, gave, sinan, an, empirical, approach, to, architecture, rather, than, a, theoretical, one, but, the, same, can, be, said, of, the, great, western, renaissance, architects, such, as, brunelleschi, and, michelangelo, various, sources, state, that, sinan, was, the, architect, of, at, least, 374, structures, which,

builders, the, development, and, maturing, stages, of, sinan, s, career, can, be, illustrated, by, three, major, works, the, first, two, of, these, are, in, istanbul, the, ehzade, mosque, which, he, calls, a, work, of, his, apprenticeship, period, and, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, which, is, the, work, of, his, qualification, stage, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, is, the, product, of, his, master, stage, ehzade, mosque, is, the, first, of, the, grand, mosques, created, by, sinan, the, mihrimah, sultan, mosque, which, is, also, known, as, the, sk, dar, quay, mosque, was, completed, in, the, same, year, and, has, an, original, design, with, its, main, dome, supported, by, three, half, domes, when, sinan, reached, the, age, of, 70, he, had, completed, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, complex, this, building, situated, on, one, of, the, hills, of, istanbul, facing, the, golden, horn, and, built, in, the, name, of, s, leyman, the, magnificent, is, one, of, the, symbolic, monuments, of, the, period, the, diameter, of, the, dome, which, exceeds, the, 31, m, 102, ft, of, the, selimiye, mosque, which, sinan, completed, when, he, was, 80, is, the, most, outstanding, example, of, the, level, of, achievement, reached, by, sinan, mimar, sinan, reached, his, artistic, peak, with, the, design, architecture, tile, decorations, and, land, stone, workmanship, displayed, at, selimiye, another, area, of, architecture, where, sinan, produced, unique, designs, are, his, mausoleums, the, mausoleum, of, ehzade, mehmed, is, notable, for, with, its, exterior, decorations, and, sliced, dome, the, r, stem, pa, a, mausoleum, is, a, very, attractive, structure, in, classical, style, the, mausoleum, of, s, leyman, the, magnificent, is, an, interesting, experiment, with, an, octagonal, body, and, flat, dome, the, selim, ii, mausoleum, with, has, a, square, plan, and, is, one, of, the, best, examples, of, turkish, mausoleum, architecture, sinan, s, own, mausoleum, which, is, located, in, the, north, east, part, of, the, s, leymaniye, complex, on, the, other, hand, is, a, very, plain, structure, sinan, masterfully, combined, art, with, functionalism, in, the, bridges, he, built, the, largest, of, these, is, the, nearly, 635, m, 2, 083, ft, long, b, y, k, ekmece, bridge, other, important, examples, are, the, ailivri, bridge, the, old, bridge, in, svilengrad, on, the, maritsa, the, l, leburgaz, sokullu, mehmet, pasha, bridge, on, the, l, leburgaz, river, the, sinanl, bridge, over, the, river, ergene, and, the, mehmed, pa, a, sokolovi, bridge, over, drina, river, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, while, sinan, was, maintaining, and, improving, the, water, supply, system, of, istanbul, he, built, arched, aqueducts, at, several, locations, within, the, city, the, ma, lova, arch, over, the, alibey, river, which, is, 257, m, 843, ft, long, and, 35, m, 115, ft, high, has, two, tiers, of, arches, and, is, one, of, the, best, examples, of, its, kind, at, the, start, of, sinan, s, career, ottoman, architecture, was, highly, pragmatic, buildings, were, repetitions, of, former, types, and, were, based, on, rudimentary, plans, they, were, more, an, assembly, of, parts, than, a, conception, of, a, whole, an, architect, could, sketch, a, plan, for, a, new, building, and, an, assistant, or, foreman, knew, what, to, do, because, novel, ideas, were, avoided, moreover, architects, used, an, extravagant, margin, of, safety, in, their, designs, resulting, in, a, wasteful, use, of, material, and, labour, sinan, would, gradually, change, all, this, he, was, to, transform, established, architectural, practices, amplifying, and, transforming, the, traditions, by, adding, innovations, trying, to, approach, perfection, during, these, years, he, continued, the, traditional, pattern, of, ottoman, architecture, but, he, gradually, began, exploring, other, possibilities, because, during, his, military, career, he, had, had, the, opportunity, to, study, the, architectural, monuments, in, the, conquered, cities, of, europe, and, the, middle, east, his, first, opportunity, to, design, a, major, building, was, the, h, srev, pasha, mosque, and, its, double, medresse, in, aleppo, syria, it, was, built, in, the, winter, of, 1536, 1537, for, his, commander, in, chief, and, the, governor, of, aleppo, between, two, army, campaigns, it, was, built, hastily, and, this, is, evident, in, the, coarseness, of, execution, and, the, crude, decoration, his, first, major, commission, as, the, royal, architect, was, the, construction, of, the, haseki, sultan, complex, for, hurrem, sultan, the, wife, of, the, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, he, had, to, follow, the, plans, drawn, by, his, predecessors, sinan, retained, the, traditional, arrangement, of, the, available, space, without, any, innovations, nevertheless, it, was, already, better, built, than, the, aleppo, mosque, and, it, shows, a, certain, elegance, however, it, has, suffered, from, many, restorations, sinan, is, credited, to, have, built, a, defensive, tower, in, vlor, south, albania, in, 1537, very, similar, to, the, white, tower, of, thessaloniki, as, well, as, muradie, mosque, during, suleiman, the, magnificent, s, stay, in, the, town, for, the, preparation, of, his, expedition, towards, italy, in, 1541, he, started, the, construction, of, the, mausoleum, t, rbe, of, the, grand, admiral, hayreddin, barbarossa, it, stands, on, the, shore, of, be, ikta, on, the, european, part, of, istanbul, at, the, site, where, his, fleet, used, to, assemble, oddly, enough, the, admiral, is, not, buried, there, but, in, his, t, rbe, next, to, the, iskele, mosque, this, mausoleum, has, been, severely, neglected, since, then, mihrimah, sultan, the, only, daughter, of, suleiman, and, hurrem, and, wife, of, the, grand, vizier, r, stem, pasha, gave, sinan, the, commission, to, build, a, mosque, with, medrese, college, an, imaret, soup, kitchen, and, a, sibyan, mekteb, qur, an, school, in, sk, dar, the, imaret, no, longer, exists, this, iskele, mosque, or, jetty, mosque, already, shows, several, hallmarks, of, sinan, s, mature, style, a, spacious, high, vaulted, basement, slender, minarets, single, domed, baldacchino, flanked, by, three, semi, domes, ending, in, three, exedrae, and, a, broad, double, portico, the, construction, was, finished, in, 1548, the, construction, of, a, double, portico, was, not, a, first, in, ottoman, architecture, but, it, set, a, trend, for, country, mosques, and, mosques, of, viziers, in, particular, r, stem, pasha, and, mihrimah, required, them, later, in, their, three, mosques, in, constantinople, and, in, the, r, stem, pasha, mosque, in, tekirda, the, inner, portico, traditionally, have, stalactite, capitals, while, the, outer, portico, has, capitals, with, chevron, patterns, baklava, when, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, returned, from, another, balkan, campaign, he, received, news, that, his, son, ehzade, mehmed, had, died, at, the, age, of, twenty, two, in, november, 1543, not, long, after, sinan, had, started, the, construction, of, the, iskele, mosque, the, sultan, ordered, sinan, to, build, a, new, major, mosque, with, an, adjoining, complex, in, memory, of, his, favourite, son, this, ehzade, mosque, would, become, larger, and, more, ambitious, than, his, previous, ones, architectural, historians, consider, this, mosque, as, sinan, s, first, masterpiece, obsessed, by, the, concept, of, a, large, central, dome, sinan, turned, to, the, plans, of, mosques, such, as, the, fatih, pasha, mosque, in, diyarbak, r, or, the, piri, pasha, mosque, in, hask, y, he, must, have, visited, both, mosques, during, his, persian, campaign, sinan, built, a, mosque, with, a, central, dome, this, time, with, four, equal, half, domes, this, superstructure, is, supported, by, four, massive, but, still, elegant, free, standing, octagonal, fluted, piers, and, four, piers, incorporated, in, each, lateral, wall, in, the, corners, above, roof, level, four, turrets, serve, as, stabilizing, anchors, this, coherent, concept, already, is, markedly, different, from, the, additive, plans, of, traditional, ottoman, architecture, sedefkar, mehmed, agha, would, later, copy, the, concept, of, fluted, piers, in, his, sultan, ahmed, mosque, in, an, attempt, to, lighten, their, appearance, sinan, however, rejected, this, solution, in, his, next, mosques, by, 1550, suleiman, the, magnificent, was, at, the, height, of, his, powers, having, built, a, mosque, for, his, son, he, felt, it, was, time, to, construct, his, own, imperial, mosque, an, enduring, monument, larger, than, all, the, others, to, be, built, on, a, gently, sloping, hillside, dominating, the, golden, horn, money, was, no, problem, since, he, had, accumulated, a, treasure, from, the, loot, of, his, campaigns, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, he, gave, the, order, to, sinan, to, build, a, mosque, the, s, leymaniye, surrounded, by, a, k, lliye, consisting, of, four, colleges, a, soup, kitchen, a, hospital, an, asylum, a, hamam, a, caravanserai, and, a, hospice, for, travellers, tabhane, sinan, now, heading, a, formidable, department, with, a, great, number, of, assistants, finished, this, formidable, task, in, seven, years, before, s, leymaniye, no, mosques, had, been, built, with, half, cubic, roofs, he, got, the, idea, of, half, cubic, roof, design, from, the, hagia, sophia, through, this, monumental, achievement, sinan, emerged, from, the, anonymity, of, his, predecessors, sinan, must, have, known, the, ideas, of, the, renaissance, architect, leone, battista, alberti, who, in, turn, had, studied, de, architectura, by, the, roman, architect, and, engineer, vitruvius, since, he, too, was, concerned, in, building, the, ideal, church, reflecting, harmony, through, the, perfection, of, geometry, in, architecture, but, contrary, to, his, western, counterparts, sinan, was, more, interested, in, simplification, than, in, enrichment, he, tried, to, achieve, the, largest, volume, under, a, single, central, dome, the, dome, is, based, on, the, circle, the, perfect, geometrical, figure, representing, in, an, abstract, way, a, perfect, god, sinan, used, subtle, geometric, relationships, using, multiples, of, two, when, calculating, the, ratios, and, the, proportions, of, his, buildings, however, in, a, later, stage, he, also, used, divisions, of, three, or, ratios, of, two, to, three, when, working, out, the, width, and, the, proportions, of, domes, such, as, the, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, mosque, at, kad, rga, while, he, was, fully, occupied, with, the, construction, of, the, s, leymaniye, sinan, or, his, subordinates, drew, up, the, plans, and, gave, instructions, for, many, other, constructions, sinan, built, a, mosque, for, the, grand, vizier, pargal, brahim, pasha, and, a, mausoleum, t, rbe, at, silivrikap, constantinople, in, 1551, the, next, grand, vizier, r, stem, pasha, gave, sinan, several, more, commissions, in, 1550, he, built, a, large, inn, han, in, the, galata, district, of, istanbul, about, ten, years, later, he, built, another, han, in, edirne, and, between, 1544, and, 1561, the, ta, han, at, erzurum, he, designed, a, caravanserai, in, eregli, and, an, octagonal, madrasah, in, constantinople, between, 1553, and, 1555, sinan, built, the, sinan, pasha, mosque, at, be, ikta, a, smaller, version, of, the, erefeli, mosque, at, edirne, for, the, grand, admiral, sinan, pasha, this, proves, again, that, sinan, had, thoroughly, studied, the, work, of, other, architects, especially, since, he, was, responsible, for, the, upkeep, of, these, buildings, he, copied, the, old, form, pondered, over, the, weaknesses, in, the, construction, and, tried, to, solve, this, with, his, own, solution, in, 1554, sinan, used, the, form, of, the, sinan, pasha, mosque, again, for, the, construction, of, the, mosque, for, the, next, grand, vizier, kara, ahmet, pasha, in, constantinople, his, first, hexagonal, mosque, by, using, a, hexagonal, plan, sinan, could, reduce, the, side, domes, to, half, domes, and, set, them, in, the, corners, at, an, angle, of, 45, degrees, clearly, sinan, must, have, appreciated, this, form, since, he, repeated, it, later, in, mosques, such, as, the, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, mosque, at, kad, rga, and, the, atik, valide, mosque, at, sk, dar, in, 1556, sinan, built, the, haseki, h, rrem, sultan, hamam, replacing, the, antique, baths, of, zeuxippus, which, are, still, standing, close, to, the, hagia, sophia, this, would, become, one, of, the, most, beautiful, hamams, he, ever, constructed, in, 1559, he, built, the, cafer, a, a, madrasah, below, the, forecourt, of, the, hagia, sophia, in, the, same, year, he, began, the, construction, of, a, small, mosque, for, iskender, pasha, at, kanl, ca, beside, the, bosphorus, this, was, one, of, the, many, minor, and, routine, commissions, the, office, of, sinan, received, over, the, years, in, 1561, when, r, stem, pasha, died, sinan, began, the, construction, of, the, r, stem, pasha, mosque, as, a, memorial, supervised, by, his, widow, mihrimah, sultan, it, is, situated, just, below, the, s, leymaniye, this, time, the, central, form, is, octagonal, modelled, on, the, monastery, church, of, saints, sergius, and, bacchus, with, four, small, semi, domes, set, in, the, corners, in, the, same, year, sinan, built, a, t, rbe, for, r, stem, pasha, in, the, garden, of, the, ehzade, mosque, decorated, with, the, finest, tiles, iznik, could, produce, mihrimah, sultan, having, doubled, her, wealth, after, the, death, of, her, husband, now, wanted, a, mosque, of, her, own, sinan, built, the, mihrimah, mosque, at, edirnekap, edirne, gate, for, her, on, the, highest, of, the, seven, hills, of, constantinople, he, raised, the, mosque, on, a, vaulted, platform, accentuating, its, hilltop, site, there, is, some, speculation, concerning, the, dates, until, recently, this, was, supposed, to, be, between, 1540, and, 1540, but, now, it, is, generally, accepted, to, be, between, 1562, and, 1565, sinan, concerned, with, grandeur, built, a, mosque, in, one, of, his, most, imaginative, designs, using, new, support, systems, and, lateral, spaces, to, increase, the, area, available, for, windows, he, built, a, central, dome, 37, m, 121, ft, high, and, 20, m, 66, ft, wide, supported, by, pendentives, on, a, square, base, with, two, lateral, galleries, each, with, three, cupolas, at, each, corner, of, this, square, stands, a, gigantic, pier, connected, with, immense, arches, each, with, 15, large, windows, and, four, circular, ones, flooding, the, interior, with, light, the, style, of, this, revolutionary, building, was, as, close, to, the, gothic, style, as, ottoman, structure, permits, in, 1566, sinan, completed, the, banya, bashi, mosque, in, sofia, bulgaria, currently, the, only, functioning, mosque, in, the, city, his, first, mosque, in, sofia, was, built, in, 1528, popularly, known, as, imaret, mosque, or, black, mosque, due, to, the, dark, colour, of, its, building, stone, it, was, damaged, by, an, earthquake, and, abandoned, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, 1560s, he, built, the, kirkcesme, water, supply, system, for, istanbul, it, is, seen, as, a, masterpiece, of, his, work, it, spans, 55, km, and, includes, 35, aqueduct, bridges, 4, of, which, are, notable, for, their, height, up, to, 35m, as, well, as, their, length, up, to, 700m, between, 1560, and, 1566, sinan, built, a, mosque, in, constantinople, for, zal, mahmud, pasha, on, a, hillside, beyond, ayvansaray, sinan, certainly, conceived, the, plans, and, partly, supervised, the, construction, but, left, the, building, of, lesser, areas, to, less, than, competent, hands, since, sinan, and, his, most, able, assistants, were, about, to, begin, his, masterpiece, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, on, the, outside, the, mosque, rises, high, with, its, east, wall, pierced, by, four, tiers, of, windows, this, gives, the, mosque, an, aspect, of, a, palace, or, even, a, block, of, apartments, inside, there, are, three, broad, galleries, making, the, interior, look, compact, the, heaviness, of, this, structure, makes, the, dome, look, unexpectedly, lofty, these, galleries, look, like, a, preliminary, try, out, for, the, galleries, of, the, selimiye, mosque, in, this, late, stage, of, his, life, sinan, tried, to, create, unified, and, sublimely, elegant, interiors, to, achieve, this, he, eliminated, all, the, unnecessary, subsidiary, spaces, beyond, the, supporting, piers, of, the, central, dome, this, can, be, seen, in, the, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, mosque, in, kad, rga, istanbul, 1571, 1572, and, in, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, in, other, buildings, of, his, final, period, sinan, experimented, with, spatial, and, mural, treatments, that, were, new, in, the, classical, ottoman, architecture, according, to, him, from, his, autobiography, tezkiret, l, b, nyan, his, masterpiece, is, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, breaking, free, of, the, handicaps, of, traditional, ottoman, architecture, this, mosque, marks, the, climax, of, sinan, s, work, and, of, all, classical, ottoman, architecture, while, it, was, being, built, the, architect, s, saying, of, you, can, never, build, a, dome, larger, than, the, dome, of, hagia, sophia, and, specially, as, muslims, was, his, main, motivation, when, it, was, completed, sinan, claimed, that, it, had, the, largest, dome, in, the, world, leaving, hagia, sophia, behind, in, fact, the, dome, height, from, the, ground, level, was, lower, and, the, diameter, barely, larger, 0, 5, meters, approximately, 2, feet, than, the, millennium, older, hagia, sophia, however, measured, from, its, base, the, dome, of, selimiye, is, higher, sinan, was, more, than, 80, years, old, when, the, building, was, finished, in, this, mosque, he, finally, realized, his, aim, of, creating, the, optimum, completely, unified, domed, interior, a, triumph, of, space, that, dominates, the, interior, he, used, this, time, an, octagonal, central, dome, 31, 28, m, wide, and, 42, m, high, supported, by, eight, elephantine, piers, of, marble, and, granite, these, supports, lack, any, capitals, but, have, squinches, or, consoles, at, their, summit, leading, to, the, optical, effect, that, the, arches, seem, to, grow, integrally, out, of, the, piers, by, placing, the, lateral, galleries, far, away, he, increased, the, three, dimensional, effect, the, many, windows, in, the, screen, walls, flood, the, interior, with, light, the, buttressing, semi, domes, are, set, in, the, four, corners, of, the, square, under, the, dome, the, weight, and, the, internal, tensions, are, hidden, producing, an, airy, and, elegant, effect, rarely, seen, under, a, central, dome, the, four, minarets, 83, m, high, at, the, corners, of, the, prayer, hall, are, the, tallest, in, the, muslim, world, accentuating, the, vertical, posture, of, this, mosque, that, already, dominates, the, city, he, also, designed, the, sulaymaniyya, takiyya, in, damascus, syria, considered, to, have, marked, the, introduction, of, the, ottoman, architectural, style, to, the, city, he, has, also, built, mehmed, pa, a, sokolovi, bridge, across, the, drina, river, in, vi, egrad, bosnia, and, herzegovina, which, is, now, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, at, the, start, of, his, career, as, an, architect, sinan, had, to, deal, with, an, established, traditional, domed, architecture, his, training, as, an, army, engineer, led, him, to, approach, architecture, from, an, empirical, point, of, view, rather, than, from, a, theoretical, one, he, started, to, experiment, with, the, design, and, engineering, of, single, domed, and, multiple, domed, structures, he, tried, to, obtain, a, new, geometrical, purity, a, rationality, and, a, spatial, integrity, in, his, structures, and, designs, of, mosques, through, all, this, he, demonstrated, his, creativity, and, his, wish, to, create, a, clear, unified, space, he, started, to, develop, a, series, of, variations, on, the, domes, surrounding, them, in, different, ways, with, semi, domes, piers, screen, walls, and, different, sets, of, galleries, his, domes, and, arches, are, curved, but, he, avoided, curvilinear, elements, in, the, rest, of, his, design, transforming, the, circle, of, the, dome, into, a, rectangular, hexagonal, or, octagonal, system, he, tried, to, obtain, a, rational, harmony, between, the, exterior, pyramidal, composition, of, semi, domes, culminating, in, a, single, drumless, dome, and, the, interior, space, where, this, central, dome, vertically, integrates, the, space, into, a, unified, whole, his, genius, lies, in, the, organization, of, this, space, and, in, the, resolution, of, the, tensions, created, by, the, design, he, was, an, innovator, in, the, use, of, decoration, and, motifs, merging, them, into, the, architectural, forms, as, a, whole, he, accentuated, the, centre, underneath, the, central, dome, by, flooding, it, with, light, from, the, many, windows, he, incorporated, his, mosques, in, an, efficient, way, into, a, complex, k, lliye, serving, the, needs, of, the, community, as, an, intellectual, centre, a, community, centre, and, serving, the, social, needs, and, the, health, problems, of, the, faithful, when, sinan, died, classical, ottoman, architecture, had, reached, its, climax, no, successor, was, gifted, enough, to, better, the, design, of, the, selimiye, mosque, and, to, develop, it, further, his, students, retreated, to, earlier, models, such, as, the, ehzade, mosque, invention, faded, away, and, a, decline, set, in, according, to, the, official, list, of, his, works, the, tezkiret, l, ebniye, during, his, 50, year, tenure, of, the, post, of, imperial, architect, sinan, constructed, or, supervised, 476, buildings, 196, of, which, survive, he, could, not, possibly, have, designed, them, all, but, relied, on, the, skills, of, his, office, he, took, credit, and, the, responsibility, for, their, work, as, a, janissary, and, thus, a, slave, of, the, sultan, his, primary, responsibility, was, to, the, sultan, in, his, spare, time, he, also, designed, buildings, for, the, chief, officials, he, delegated, to, his, assistants, the, construction, of, less, important, buildings, in, the, provinces, some, of, his, works, sinan, died, in, ah, 996, 1587, 88, ce, and, is, buried, in, a, tomb, in, istanbul, a, t, rbe, of, his, own, design, just, to, the, north, of, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, across, a, street, named, mimar, sinan, caddesi, in, his, honour, he, was, buried, near, the, tombs, of, his, greatest, patrons, sultan, s,
