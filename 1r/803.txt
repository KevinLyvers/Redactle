and, noted, the, paulista, academics, claims, that, there, is, no, social, question, in, the, new, world, unlike, l, vi, strauss, he, did, not, actively, support, the, communist, backed, national, liberation, alliance, but, took, a, more, centrist, position, he, compared, brazil, favourably, on, account, of, its, social, malleability, and, tabula, rasa, development, as, a, young, european, civilization, to, algeria, and, even, to, the, united, states, in, his, 1937, the, concept, of, a, new, country, he, would, later, call, algeria, with, its, uneducable, population, a, failed, brazil, in, 1937, braudel, returned, to, paris, from, brazil, he, spent, the, twenty, day, sea, journey, in, the, company, of, febvre, and, his, family, as, both, had, booked, passage, on, the, same, ship,

la, m, diterran, e, et, le, monde, m, diterran, en, l, poque, de, philippe, ii, the, mediterranean, and, the, mediterranean, world, in, the, age, of, philip, ii, without, access, to, his, personal, collection, of, books, and, notes, which, forced, him, to, rely, in, that, regard, on, his, prodigious, memory, according, to, his, own, account, the, long, time, perspective, he, took, was, in, part, a, direct, existential, reaction, to, the, troubling, war, news, by, choosing, the, position, of, god, the, father, himself, as, a, refuge, he, sought, to, assert, the, perdurability, and, majestic, immobility, of, the, mediterranean, against, the, fleeting, occurrence, of, political, events, which, he, associated, with, the, daily, misery, of, the, camp, he, sent, completed, copy, books, to, febvre, in, paris, first, apparently, through, the, international, red, cross, and, after, obtaining, written, authorisation, from, the, okw, in, november, 1942, via, the, german, embassy, in, paris, he, occasionally, dispatched, books, to, febvre, as, well, he, edited, his, work, after, his, release, in, 1945, by, checking, it, against, the, archival, material, that, survived, the, war, in, a, metal, container, in, the, basement, of, his, paris, house, he, cut, portions, from, the, copy, books, and, re, arranged, the, text, with, new, insertions, then, destroyed, the, manuscripts, only, a, fragment, gifted, to, febvre, has, survived, during, the, war, his, wife, and, children, lived, in, algeria, braudel, became, the, leader, of, the, second, generation, of, annales, historians, after,

rockefeller, foundation, which, had, previously, supported, the, wartime, exile, cole, libre, des, hautes, tudes, in, new, york, to, set, up, the, sixi, me, section, for, economic, and, social, sciences, at, the, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, ephe, which, then, became, the, funnel, for, all, historical, research, in, france, in, 1948, the, centre, de, recherches, historiques, was, established, there, with, braudel, as, its, director, in, 1949, he, was, elected, by, the, professors, of, the, coll, ge, de, france, as, one, of, their, number, upon, febvre, s, retirement, he, co, founded, the, academic, journal, revue, conomique, in, 1950, he, became, the, head, of, the, sixi, me, section, at, ephe, after, the, death, of, febvre, in, 1956, and, attracted, scholars, such, as, roland, barthes, and, jacques, lacan, to, join, its, activities, he, became, the, editor, in, chief, of, the, annales, in, 1957, which, completed, his, rise, to, unrivalled, influence, on, the, development, of, the, historical, studies, in, france, in, the, post, war, years, he, received, an, additional, 1, million, from, the, ford, foundation, in, 1960, in, 1962, he, and, gaston, berger, used, the, ford, foundation, grant, and, government, funds, to, create, a, new, independent, foundation, the, fondation, maison, des, sciences, de, l, homme, fmsh, which, braudel, directed, from, 1970, to, his, death, it, was, housed, in, the, building, called, maison, des, sciences, de, l, homme, fmsh, focused, its, activities, on, international, networking, in, order, to, disseminate, the, annales, approach, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, to, the, world, in, 1972, braudel, gave, up, all, editorial, responsibility, on, the, annales, journal, but, his, name, remained, on, the, masthead, in, 1962, braudel, wrote, a, history, of, civilizations, as, the, basis, for, a, history, course, but, its, rejection, of, the, traditional, event, based, narrative, was, too, radical, for, the, french, ministry, of, education, which, in, turn, rejected, it, he, retired, in, 1968, in, 1975, the, sixi, me, section, was, transformed, into, school, for, advanced, studies, in, the, social, sciences, a, public, institution, of, higher, education, in, its, own, right, in, 1984, he, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, and, his, introduction, speech, was, given, by, maurice, druon, his, first, book, la, m, diterran, e, et, le, monde, m, diterran, en, l, poque, de, philippe, ii, 1949, the, mediterranean, and, the, mediterranean, world, in, the, age, of, philip, ii, was, his, most, influential, and, has, been, described, as, a, watershed, for, braudel, there, is, no, single, mediterranean, sea, there, are, many, seas, indeed, a, vast, complex, expanse, within, which, men, operate, life, is, conducted, on, the, mediterranean, people, travel, fish, fight, wars, and, drown, in, its, various, contexts, and, the, sea, articulates, with, the, plains, and, islands, life, on, the, plains, is, diverse, and, complex, the, poorer, south, is, affected, by, religious, diversity, catholicism, and, islam, as, well, as, by, intrusions, both, cultural, and, economic, from, the, north, in, other, words, the, mediterranean, cannot, be, understood, independently, from, what, is, exterior, to, it, any, rigid, adherence, to, boundaries, falsifies, the, situation, the, first, level, of, time, geographical, time, is, that, of, the, environment, with, its, slow, almost, imperceptible, change, its, repetition, and, cycles, such, change, may, be, slow, but, it, is, irresistible, the, second, level, of, time, comprises, long, term, social, economic, and, cultural, history, where, braudel, discusses, the, mediterranean, economy, social, groupings, empires, and, civilizations, change, at, that, level, is, much, more, rapid, than, that, of, the, environment, braudel, looks, at, two, or, three, centuries, to, spot, a, particular, pattern, such, as, the, rise, and, fall, of, various, aristocracies, the, third, level, of, time, is, that, of, events, histoire, v, nementielle, this, is, the, history, of, individuals, with, names, that, for, braudel, is, the, time, of, surfaces, and, deceptive, effects, it, is, the, time, of, the, courte, dur, e, proper, and, the, focus, of, part, 3, of, the, mediterranean, which, treats, of, events, politics, and, people, braudel, s, mediterranean, is, centered, on, the, sea, but, just, as, importantly, it, is, also, the, desert, and, the, mountains, the, desert, creates, a, nomadic, form, of, social, organization, where, the, whole, community, moves, mountain, life, is, sedentary, transhumance, the, movement, from, the, mountain, to, the, plain, or, vice, versa, in, a, given, season, is, also, a, persistent, part, of, mediterranean, existence, braudel, s, vast, panoramic, view, used, insights, from, other, social, sciences, employed, the, concept, of, the, longue, dur, e, and, downplayed, the, importance, of, specific, events, it, was, widely, admired, but, most, historians, did, not, try, to, replicate, it, and, instead, focused, on, their, specialized, monographs, the, book, firmly, launched, the, study, of, the, mediterranean, and, dramatically, raised, the, worldwide, profile, of, the, annales, school, in, the, 1966, second, edition, to, his, book, which, went, further, in, the, direction, of, seeking, scientific, precision, through, economic, quantification, braudel, claimed, that, over, the, previous, twenty, to, thirty, years, the, chain, of, economic, events, and, their, short, term, conjunctures, had, been, established, as, a, less, obvious, alternative, to, the, traditional, chain, of, political, events, the, second, edition, appeared, in, 70, 000, copies, in, contrast, to, 2, 500, copies, of, the, first, edition, it, was, only, with, the, publishing, of, the, english, translation, of, the, second, edition, of, his, book, that, braudel, s, work, began, to, make, an, impact, on, anglophone, scholarship, after, la, m, diterran, e, braudel, s, most, famous, work, is, civilisation, mat, rielle, conomie, et, capitalisme, xv, e, xviii, e, civilization, and, capitalism, 15th, 18th, century, the, first, volume, was, published, in, 1967, and, was, translated, to, english, in, 1973, the, last, of, the, three, volume, work, appeared, in, 1979, the, work, is, a, broad, scale, history, of, the, pre, industrial, modern, world, focusing, on, how, regular, people, made, economies, work, like, all, of, braudel, s, other, major, works, it, mixes, traditional, economic, material, with, thick, description, of, the, social, impact, of, economic, events, on, various, facets, of, everyday, life, including, food, fashion, and, other, social, customs, the, third, volume, subtitled, the, perspective, of, the, world, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, work, of, german, scholars, like, werner, sombart, in, it, braudel, traces, the, impact, of, the, centers, of, western, capitalism, on, the, rest, of, the, world, braudel, wrote, the, series, as, a, way, of, explanation, for, the, modern, way, and, partly, as, a, refutation, of, the, marxist, view, of, history, braudel, discussed, the, idea, of, long, term, cycles, in, the, capitalist, economy, that, he, saw, developing, in, europe, in, the, 12th, century, particular, cities, and, later, nation, states, follow, each, other, sequentially, as, centres, of, these, cycles, venice, in, the, 13th, through, the, 15th, centuries, 1250, 1510, antwerp, and, genoa, in, the, 16th, century, 1500, 1569, and, 1557, 1627, respectively, amsterdam, in, the, 16th, through, 18th, centuries, 1627, 1733, and, london, and, england, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, 1733, 1896, he, used, the, word, structures, to, denote, a, variety, of, social, structures, such, as, organized, behaviours, attitudes, and, conventions, as, well, as, physical, structures, and, infrastructures, he, argued, that, the, structures, established, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, contributed, to, the, successes, of, present, day, european, based, cultures, he, attributed, much, of, that, to, the, long, standing, independence, of, city, states, which, though, later, subjugated, by, larger, geographic, states, were, not, always, completely, suppressed, probably, for, reasons, of, utility, braudel, argues, that, capitalists, have, typically, been, monopolists, and, not, as, is, usually, assumed, entrepreneurs, operating, in, competitive, markets, he, argued, that, capitalists, did, not, specialize, and, did, not, use, free, markets, and, he, thus, diverges, from, both, liberal, adam, smith, and, marxian, interpretations, in, braudel, s, view, the, state, in, capitalist, countries, has, served, as, a, guarantor, of, monopolists, rather, than, a, protector, of, competition, as, it, is, usually, portrayed, he, asserted, that, capitalists, have, had, power, and, cunning, on, their, side, as, they, have, arrayed, themselves, against, the, majority, of, the, population, an, agrarian, structure, is, a, long, term, structure, in, the, braudelian, understanding, of, the, concept, on, a, larger, scale, the, agrarian, structure, is, more, dependent, on, the, regional, social, cultural, and, historical, factors, than, on, the, state, s, undertaken, activities, braudel, s, last, and, most, personal, book, was, l, identit, de, la, france, the, identity, of, france, which, was, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1985, unlike, in, many, of, braudel, s, other, books, he, makes, no, secret, of, his, profound, love, of, his, country, in, this, book, and, remarks, at, the, beginning, that, he, had, loved, france, as, if, she, were, a, woman, reflecting, his, interest, with, the, longue, dur, e, braudel, s, concern, in, l, identit, de, la, france, was, with, the, centuries, and, millennia, instead, of, the, years, and, decades, braudel, argued, that, france, is, the, product, not, of, its, politics, or, economics, but, rather, of, its, geography, and, culture, a, thesis, that, braudel, had, explored, in, a, wide, ranging, book, that, saw, the, bourg, and, the, patois, histoire, totale, integrated, into, a, broad, sweep, of, both, the, place, and, the, time, l, identit, de, la, france, was, much, coloured, by, a, romantic, nostalgia, as, braudel, argued, for, the, existence, of, a, france, profonde, a, deep, france, based, upon, the, peasant, mentalit, which, despite, all, of, the, turmoil, of, french, history, and, the, industrial, revolution, has, survived, intact, right, up, to, the, present, in, this, book, he, expressed, a, conviction, that, economics, is, the, most, scientific, of, the, sciences, of, man, while, history, is, merely, an, imperfect, one, according, to, braudel, before, the, annales, approach, the, writing, of, history, was, focused, on, the, courte, dur, e, short, span, or, on, histoire, v, nementielle, a, history, of, events, his, followers, admired, his, use, of, the, longue, dur, e, approach, to, stress, the, slow, and, often, imperceptible, effects, of, space, climate, and, technology, on, the, actions, of, human, beings, in, the, past, the, annales, historians, after, living, through, two, world, wars, and, massive, political, upheavals, in, france, were, very, uncomfortable, with, the, notion, that, multiple, ruptures, and, discontinuities, created, history, they, preferred, to, stress, inertia, and, the, longue, dur, e, arguing, that, the, continuities, in, the, deepest, structures, of, society, were, central, to, history, upheavals, in, institutions, or, the, superstructure, of, social, life, were, of, little, significance, for, history, they, argued, lies, beyond, the, reach, of, conscious, actors, especially, the, will, of, revolutionaries, they, rejected, the, marxist, idea, that, history, should, be, used, as, a, tool, to, foment, and, foster, revolutions, a, proponent, of, historical, materialism, himself, braudel, rejected, marxist, dialectical, materialism, stressing, the, equal, importance, of, infrastructure, and, superstructure, both, of, which, reflected, enduring, social, economic, and, cultural, realities, braudel, s, structures, both, mental, and, environmental, determine, the, long, term, course, of, events, by, constraining, actions, on, and, by, humans, over, a, duration, long, enough, that, they, are, beyond, the, consciousness, of, the, actors, involved, a, feature, of, braudel, s, work, was, his, compassion, for, the, suffering, of, marginal, people, he, articulated, the, view, that, most, surviving, historical, sources, come, from, the, literate, wealthy, classes, he, emphasised, the, importance, of, the, ephemeral, lives, of, slaves, serfs, peasants, and, the, urban, poor, and, demonstrated, their, contributions, to, the, wealth, and, power, of, their, respective, masters, and, societies, his, work, was, often, illustrated, with, contemporary, depictions, of, daily, life, and, rarely, with, pictures, of, noblemen, or, kings, he, chose, to, emphasise, constraints, on, human, agency, as, j, h, elliott, noted, in, a, review, of, his, first, book, braudel, s, mediterranean, is, a, world, unresponsive, to, human, control, so, that, braudel, s, mountains, move, his, men, but, never, his, men, the, mountains, this, preference, for, objective, explanations, at, the, expense, of, human, decisions, could, lead, braudel, towards, dubious, conclusions, as, when, he, asserted, that, overpopulation, was, the, principal, reason, for, the, expulsion, of, jews, from, spain, portugal, and, sicily, at, the, turn, of, the, fifteenth, century, braudel, is, considered, a, precursor, of, the, world, systems, theory, binghamton, university, in, new, york, had, a, fernand, braudel, center, until, 2020, and, there, is, an, instituto, fernand, braudel, de, economia, mundial, in, s, o, paulo, brazil, in, a, 2011, poll, by, history, today, magazine, fernand, braudel, was, picked, as, the, most, important, historian, of, the, previous, 60, years
