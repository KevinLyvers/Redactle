lessons, she, also, had, unrestricted, access, to, her, father, s, vast, library, exposing, her, to, much, of, the, literary, canon, this, resulted, in, a, greater, depth, of, reading, than, any, of, her, cambridge, contemporaries, later, virginia, recalled, even, today, there, may, be, parents, who, would, doubt, the, wisdom, of, allowing, a, girl, of, fifteen, the, free, run, of, a, large, and, quite, unexpurgated, library, but, my, father, allowed, it, there, were, certain, facts, very, briefly, very, shyly, he, referred, to, them, yet, read, what, you, like, he, said, and, all, his, books, were, to, be, had, without, asking, another, source, was, the, conversation, of, their, father, s, friends, to, whom, she, was, exposed, leslie, stephen, described, his, circle, as, most, of, the, literary, people, of, mark, clever, young, writers, and, barristers, chiefly, of, the, radical, persuasion, we, used, to, meet, on, wednesday, and, sunday, evenings, to, smoke, and, drink, and,

befriended, a, circle, of, young, men, including, clive, bell, lytton, strachey, leonard, woolf, whom, virginia, would, later, marry, and, saxon, sydney, turner, to, whom, he, would, introduce, his, sisters, at, the, trinity, may, ball, in, 1900, these, men, formed, a, reading, group, they, named, the, midnight, society, which, the, stephen, sisters, would, later, be, invited, to, after, their,

the, group, began, to, increasingly, explore, progressive, ideas, with, open, discussions, of, members, homosexual, inclinations, and, nude, dancing, from, vanessa, who, in, 1910, went, so, far, as, to, propose, a, libertarian, society, with, sexual, freedom, for, all, virginia, appears, not, to, have, shown, interest, in, practising, the, group, s, free, love, ideology, finding, an, outlet, for, her, sexual, desires, only, in, writing, around, this, time, she, began, work, on, her, first, novel, melymbrosia, which, eventually, became, the, voyage, out, 1915, in, november, 1911, virginia, and,

of, her, life, a, woman, of, exceptional, courage, intelligence, and, stoicism, who, made, the, best, use, and, achieved, the, best, understanding, she, could, of, that, illness, her, mother, s,

increasingly, restless, and, savage, suggested, being, away, from, london, vanessa, rented, moat, house, outside, canterbury, in, june, but, there, was, no, improvement, so, savage, sent, her, to, burley, for, a, rest, cure, this, involved, partial, isolation, deprivation, of, literature, and, force, feeding, and, after, six, weeks, she, was, able, to, convalesce, in, cornwall, and, dorset, during, the, autumn, she, loathed, the, experience, writing, to, her, sister, on, 28, july, she, described, how, she, found, the, religious, atmosphere, stifling, and, the, institution, ugly, and, informed, vanessa, that, to, escape, i, shall, soon, have, to, jump, out, of, a, window, the, threat, of, being, sent, back, would, later, lead, to, her, contemplating, suicide, despite, her, protests, savage, would, refer, her, back, in, 1912, for, insomnia, and, in, 1913, for, depression, on, emerging, from, burley, house, in, september, 1913, she, sought, further, opinions, from, two, other, physicians, on, the, 13th, maurice, wright, and, henry, head, who, had, been, henry, james, s, physician, both, recommended, she, return, to, burley, house, distraught, she, returned, home, and, attempted, suicide, by, taking, an, overdose, of, 100, grains, of, veronal, a, barbiturate, and, nearly, dying, on, recovery, she, went, to, dalingridge, hall, george, duckworth, s, home, in, east, grinstead, sussex, to, convalesce, on, 30, september, returning, to, asham, on, 18, november, she, remained, unstable, over, the, next, two, years, with, another, incident, involving, veronal, that, she, claimed, was, an, accident, and, consulted, another, psychiatrist, in, april, 1914, maurice, craig, who, explained, that, she, was, not, sufficiently, psychotic, to, be, certified, or, committed, to, an, institution, the, rest, of, the, summer, of, 1914, went, better, for, her, and, they, moved, to, richmond, but, in, february, 1915, just, as, the, voyage, out, was, due, to, be, published, she, relapsed, once, more, and, remained, in, poor, health, for, most, of, that, year, then, she, began, to, recover, following, 20, years, of, ill, health, nevertheless, there, was, a, feeling, among, those, around, her, that, she, was, now, permanently, changed, and, not, for, the, better, over, the, rest, of, her, life, she, suffered, recurrent, bouts, of, depression, in, 1940, a, number, of, factors, appeared, to, overwhelm, her, her, biography, of, roger, fry, had, been, published, in, july, and, she, had, been, disappointed, in, its, reception, the, horrors, of, war, depressed, her, and, their, london, homes, had, been, destroyed, in, the, blitz, in, september, and, october, woolf, had, completed, between, the, acts, published, posthumously, in, 1941, in, november, and, completing, a, novel, was, frequently, accompanied, by, exhaustion, her, health, became, increasingly, a, matter, of, concern, culminating, in, her, decision, to, end, her, life, on, 28, march, 1941, she, also, suffered, many, of, ailments, such, as, headache, back, ache, fevers, and, faints, which, related, closely, to, her, psychological, stress, these, often, lasted, for, weeks, or, even, months, and, impeded, her, work, what, a, gap, for, 60, days, those, days, spent, in, wearisome, headache, jumping, pulse, aching, back, frets, fidgets, lying, awake, sleeping, draughts, sedatives, digitalis, going, for, a, little, walk, plunging, back, into, bed, again, though, this, instability, would, frequently, affect, her, social, life, she, was, able, to, continue, her, literary, productivity, with, few, interruptions, throughout, her, life, woolf, herself, provides, not, only, a, vivid, picture, of, her, symptoms, in, her, diaries, and, letters, but, also, her, response, to, the, demons, that, haunted, her, and, at, times, made, her, long, for, death, but, it, is, always, a, question, whether, i, wish, to, avoid, these, glooms, these, 9, weeks, give, one, a, plunge, into, deep, waters, one, goes, down, into, the, well, nothing, protects, one, from, the, assault, of, truth, psychiatry, had, little, to, offer, woolf, but, she, recognised, that, writing, was, one, of, the, behaviours, that, enabled, her, to, cope, with, her, illness, the, only, way, i, keep, afloat, is, by, working, directly, i, stop, working, i, feel, that, i, am, sinking, down, down, and, as, usual, i, feel, that, if, i, sink, further, i, shall, reach, the, truth, sinking, under, water, was, woolf, s, metaphor, for, both, the, effects, of, depression, and, psychosis, but, also, for, finding, truth, and, ultimately, was, her, choice, of, death, throughout, her, life, woolf, struggled, without, success, to, find, meaning, in, her, illness, on, the, one, hand, an, impediment, on, the, other, something, she, visualised, as, an, essential, part, of, who, she, was, and, a, necessary, condition, of, her, art, her, experiences, informed, her, work, such, as, the, character, of, septimus, warren, smith, in, mrs, dalloway, 1925, who, like, woolf, was, haunted, by, the, dead, and, ultimately, takes, his, own, life, rather, than, be, admitted, to, a, sanitorium, leonard, woolf, relates, how, during, the, 30, years, they, were, married, they, consulted, many, doctors, in, the, harley, street, area, and, although, they, were, given, a, diagnosis, of, neurasthenia, he, felt, they, had, little, understanding, of, the, causes, or, nature, the, proposed, solution, was, simple, as, long, as, she, lived, a, quiet, life, without, any, physical, or, mental, exertion, she, was, well, on, the, other, hand, any, mental, emotional, or, physical, strain, resulted, in, a, reappearance, of, her, symptoms, beginning, with, a, headache, followed, by, insomnia, and, thoughts, that, started, to, race, her, remedy, was, simple, to, retire, to, bed, in, a, darkened, room, following, which, the, symptoms, slowly, subsided, modern, scholars, including, her, nephew, and, biographer, quentin, bell, have, suggested, her, breakdowns, and, subsequent, recurring, depressive, periods, were, influenced, by, the, sexual, abuse, which, she, and, her, sister, vanessa, were, subjected, to, by, their, half, brothers, george, and, gerald, duckworth, which, woolf, recalls, in, her, autobiographical, essays, a, sketch, of, the, past, and, 22, hyde, park, gate, biographers, point, out, that, when, stella, died, in, 1897, there, was, no, counterbalance, to, control, george, s, predation, and, his, nighttime, prowling, 22, hyde, park, gate, ends, with, the, sentence, the, old, ladies, of, kensington, and, belgravia, never, knew, that, george, duckworth, was, not, only, father, and, mother, brother, and, sister, to, those, poor, stephen, girls, he, was, their, lover, also, it, is, likely, that, other, factors, also, played, a, part, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, include, genetic, predisposition, virginia, s, father, leslie, stephen, suffered, from, depression, and, her, half, sister, laura, was, institutionalised, many, of, virginia, s, symptoms, including, persistent, headache, insomnia, irritability, and, anxiety, resembled, those, of, her, father, s, another, factor, is, the, pressure, she, placed, upon, herself, in, her, work, for, instance, her, breakdown, of, 1913, was, at, least, partly, triggered, by, the, need, to, finish, the, voyage, out, virginia, herself, hinted, that, her, illness, was, related, to, how, she, saw, the, repressed, position, of, women, in, society, when, she, wrote, a, room, of, one, s, own, in, a, 1930, letter, to, ethel, smyth, as, an, experience, madness, is, terrific, i, can, assure, you, and, not, to, be, sniffed, at, and, in, its, lava, i, still, find, most, of, the, things, i, write, about, it, shoots, out, of, one, everything, shaped, final, not, in, mere, driblets, as, sanity, does, and, the, six, months, not, three, that, i, lay, in, bed, taught, me, a, good, deal, about, what, is, called, oneself, thomas, caramagno, and, others, in, discussing, her, illness, oppose, the, neurotic, genius, way, of, looking, at, mental, illness, where, creativity, and, mental, illness, are, conceptualised, as, linked, rather, than, antithetical, stephen, trombley, describes, woolf, as, having, a, confrontational, relationship, with, her, doctors, and, possibly, being, a, woman, who, is, a, victim, of, male, medicine, referring, to, the, lack, of, understanding, particularly, at, the, time, about, mental, illness, the, bloomsbury, group, held, very, progressive, views, regarding, sexuality, and, rejected, the, austere, strictness, of, victorian, society, the, majority, of, its, members, were, homosexual, or, bisexual, woolf, had, several, affairs, with, women, the, most, notable, being, with, vita, sackville, west, the, two, women, developed, a, deep, connection, vita, was, arguably, one, of, the, few, people, in, virginia, s, adult, life, that, she, was, truly, close, to, told, ethel, that, she, only, really, loved, three, people, leonard, vanessa, and, myself, which, annoyed, ethel, but, pleased, me, vita, sackville, west, s, letter, to, husband, harold, nicolson, dated, 28, september, 1939, during, their, relationship, both, women, saw, the, peak, of, their, literary, careers, with, the, titular, protagonist, of, woolf, s, acclaimed, orlando, a, biography, being, inspired, by, sackville, west, the, pair, remained, lovers, for, a, decade, and, stayed, close, friends, for, the, rest, of, woolf, s, life, woolf, had, said, to, sackville, west, she, disliked, masculinity, dislikes, the, possessiveness, and, love, of, domination, in, men, in, fact, she, dislikes, the, quality, of, masculinity, says, that, women, stimulate, her, imagination, by, their, grace, their, art, of, life, vita, sackville, west, s, diary, dated, 26, september, 1928, among, her, other, notable, affairs, were, those, with, sibyl, colefax, lady, ottoline, morrell, and, mary, hutchinson, some, surmise, that, she, may, have, fallen, in, love, with, madge, symonds, the, wife, of, one, of, her, uncles, madge, symonds, was, described, as, one, of, woolf, s, early, loves, in, sackville, west, s, diary, she, also, fell, in, love, with, violet, dickinson, although, there, is, some, confusion, as, to, whether, the, two, consummated, their, relationship, in, regard, to, relationships, with, men, woolf, was, averse, to, sex, with, them, blaming, the, sexual, abuse, perpetrated, upon, her, and, her, sister, by, her, half, brothers, when, they, were, children, and, teens, this, is, one, of, the, reasons, she, initially, declined, marriage, proposals, from, her, future, husband, leonard, she, even, went, as, far, as, to, tell, him, that, she, was, not, attracted, to, him, but, that, she, did, love, him, and, finally, agreed, to, marriage, woolf, preferred, female, lovers, to, male, lovers, for, the, most, part, based, on, her, aversion, to, sex, with, men, this, aversion, to, relations, with, men, influenced, her, writing, especially, when, considering, her, sexual, abuse, as, a, child, i, sometimes, think, that, if, i, married, you, i, could, have,

virginia, dated, may, 1, 1912, leonard, became, the, love, of, her, life, and, even, though, their, sexual, relationship, was, questionable, they, loved, each, other, deeply, and, formed, a, strong, and, supportive, marriage, that, led, to, the, formation, of, their, publishing, house, as, well, as, several, of, her, writings, neither, was, monogamous, with, the, other, sexually, but, they, were, faithful, in, their, love, and, respect, for, each, other, woolf, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, 20th, century, novelists, a, modernist, she, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of,

bed, and, other, essays, 1950, among, woolf, s, non, fiction, works, one, of, the, best, known, is, a, room, of, one, s, own, 1929, a, book, length, essay, considered, a, key, work, of, feminist, literary, criticism, it, was, written, following, two, lectures, she, delivered, on, women, and, fiction, at, cambridge, university, the, previous, year, in, it, she, examines, the, historical, disempowerment, women, have, faced, in, many, spheres, including, social, educational, and, financial, one, of, her, more, famous, dicta, is, contained, within, the, book, a, woman, must, have, money, and, a, room, of, her, own, if, she, is, to, write, fiction, much, of, her, argument, to, show, you, how, i, arrived, at, this, opinion, about, the, room, and, the, money, is, developed, through, the, unsolved, problems, of, women, and, fiction, writing, to, arrive, at, her, conclusion, although, she, claimed, that, was, only, an, opinion, upon, one, minor, point, in, doing, so, she, states, a, good, deal, about, the, nature, of, women, and, fiction, employing, a, quasi, fictional, style, as, she, examines, where, women, writers, failed, because, of, lack, of, resources, and, opportunities, examining, along, the, way, the, experiences, of, the, bront, s, george, eliot, and, george, sand, as, well, as, the, fictional, character, of, shakespeare, s, sister, equipped, with, the, same, genius, but, not, position, she, contrasted, these, women, who, accepted, a, deferential, status, with, jane, austen, who, wrote, entirely, as, a, woman, virginia, had, taken, up, book, binding, as, a, pastime, in, october, 1901, at, the, age, of, 19, the, woolfs, had, been, discussing, setting, up, a, publishing, house, for, some, time, leonard, intended, for, it, to, give, virginia, a, rest, from, the, strain, of, writing, and, therefore, help, her, fragile, mental, health, additionally, publishing, her, works, under, their, own, outfit, would, save, her, from, the, stress, of, submitting, her, work, to, an, external, company, which, contributed, to, her, breakdown, during, the, process, of, publishing, her, first, novel, the, voyage, out, the, woolfs, obtained, their, own, hand, printing, press, in, april, 1917, and, set, it, up, on, their, dining, room, table, at, hogarth, house, thus, beginning, the, hogarth, press, the, first, publication, was, two, stories, in, july, 1917, consisting, of, the, mark, on, the, wall, by, virginia, woolf, which, has, been, described, as, woolf, s, first, foray, into, modernism, and, three, jews, by, leonard, woolf, the, accompanying, illustrations, by, dora, carrington, were, a, success, leading, virginia, to, remark, that, the, press, was, specially, good, at, printing, pictures, and, we, see, that, we, must, make, a, practice, of, always, having, pictures, the, process, took, two, and, a, half, months, with, a, production, run, of, 150, copies, other, short, short, stories, followed, including, kew, gardens, 1919, with, a, woodblock, by, vanessa, bell, as, frontispiece, subsequently, bell, added, further, illustrations, adorning, each, page, of, the, text, unlike, its, contemporary, small, printers, who, specialised, in, expensive, artisanal, reprints, the, woolfs, concentrated, on, living, avant, garde, authors, and, over, the, subsequent, five, years, printed, works, by, a, number, of, authors, including, katherine, mansfield, t, s, eliot, e, m, forster, clive, bell, and, roger, fry, they, also, produced, translations, of, russian, works, with, s, s, koteliansky, and, the, first, translation, of, the, complete, works, of, sigmund, freud, they, acquired, a, larger, press, in, 1921, and, began, to, sell, directly, to, booksellers, in, 1938, virginia, sold, her, share, of, the, company, to, john, lehmann, who, had, started, working, for, hogarth, press, seven, years, previously, the, press, eventually, became, leonard, s, only, source, of, income, but, his, association, with, it, ended, in, 1946, after, publishing, 527, titles, and, hogarth, is, now, an, imprint, of, penguin, random, house, the, press, also, produced, explicitly, political, works, pamphlets, had, fallen, out, of, fashion, due, to, the, high, production, costs, and, low, revenue, but, the, hogarth, press, produced, several, series, on, contemporary, issues, of, international, politics, challenging, colonialism, and, critiquing, soviet, russia, and, italian, fascism, the, woolfs, also, published, political, fiction, including, turbott, wolfe, 1926, by, william, plomer, and, in, a, province, 1934, by, laurens, van, der, post, which, concern, south, african, racial, policies, and, revolutionary, movements, respectively, virginia, woolf, saw, a, link, between, international, politics, and, feminism, publishing, a, biography, of, indian, feminist, activist, saroj, nalini, dutt, and, the, memoirs, of, suffragette, elizabeth, robins, scholar, ursula, mctaggart, argues, that, the, hogarth, press, shaped, and, represented, woolf, s, later, concept, of, an, outsiders, society, a, non, organised, group, of, women, who, would, resist, the, patriarchal, fascism, of, war, and, nationalism, by, exerting, influence, through, private, actions, as, described, in, three, guineas, in, this, view, the, readers, and, authors, form, a, loose, network, with, the, press, providing, the, means, to, exchange, ideas, michel, lackey, argues, that, a, major, influence, on, woolf, from, 1912, onward, was, russian, literature, and, woolf, adopted, many, of, its, aesthetic, conventions, the, style, of, fyodor, dostoyevsky, with, his, depiction, of, a, fluid, mind, in, operation, helped, to, influence, woolf, s, writings, about, a, discontinuous, writing, process, though, woolf, objected, to, dostoyevsky, s, obsession, with, psychological, extremity, and, the, tumultuous, flux, of, emotions, in, his, characters, together, with, his, right, wing, monarchist, politics, as, dostoyevsky, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, autocracy, of, the, russian, empire, in, contrast, to, her, objections, to, dostoyevsky, s, exaggerated, emotional, pitch, woolf, found, much, to, admire, in, the, work, of, anton, chekhov, and, leo, tolstoy, woolf, admired, chekhov, for, his, stories, of, ordinary, people, living, their, lives, doing, banal, things, and, plots, that, had, no, neat, endings, from, tolstoy, woolf, drew, lessons, about, how, a, novelist, should, depict, a, character, s, psychological, state, and, the, interior, tension, within, lackey, notes, that, from, ivan, turgenev, woolf, drew, the, lessons, that, there, are, multiple, i, s, when, writing, a, novel, and, the, novelist, needed, to, balance, those, multiple, versions, of, him, or, herself, to, balance, the, mundane, facts, of, a, story, vs, the, writer, s, overarching, vision, which, required, a, total, passion, for, art, the, american, writer, henry, david, thoreau, also, influenced, woolf, in, a, 1917, essay, she, praised, thoreau, for, his, statement, the, millions, are, awake, enough, for, physical, labor, but, only, one, in, hundreds, of, millions, is, awake, enough, to, a, poetic, or, divine, life, to, be, awake, is, to, be, alive, they, both, aimed, to, capture, the, moment, as, walter, pater, says, to, burn, always, with, this, hard, gem, like, flame, woolf, praised, thoreau, for, his, simplicity, in, finding, a, way, for, setting, free, the, delicate, and, complicated, machinery, of, the, soul, like, thoreau, woolf, believed, that, it, was, silence, that, set, the, mind, free, to, really, contemplate, and, understand, the, world, both, authors, believed, in, a, certain, transcendental, mystical, approach, to, life, and, writing, where, even, banal, things, could, be, capable, of, generating, deep, emotions, if, one, had, enough, silence, and, the, presence, of, mind, to, appreciate, them, woolf, and, thoreau, were, both, concerned, with, the, difficulty, of, human, relationships, in, the, modern, age, woolf, s, preface, to, orlando, credits, daniel, defoe, sir, thomas, browne, laurence, sterne, sir, walter, scott, lord, macaulay, emily, bront, thomas, de, quincey, and, walter, pater, as, influences, among, her, contemporaries, woolf, was, influenced, by, marcel, proust, writing, to, roger, fry, oh, if, i, could, write, like, that, the, intense, scrutiny, of, virginia, woolf, s, literary, output, has, led, to, speculation, as, to, her, mother, s, influence, including, psychoanalytic, studies, of, mother, and, daughter, her, memories, of, her, mother, are, memories, of, an, obsession, starting, with, her, first, major, breakdown, on, her, mother, s, death, in, 1895, the, loss, having, a, profound, lifelong, effect, in, many, ways, her, mother, s, profound, influence, on, virginia, woolf, is, conveyed, in, the, latter, s, recollections, there, she, is, beautiful, emphatic, closer, than, any, of, the, living, are, lighting, our, random, lives, as, with, a, burning, torch, infinitely, noble, and, delightful, to, her, children, woolf, s, understanding, of, her, mother, and, family, evolved, considerably, between, 1907, and, 1940, in, which, the, somewhat, distant, yet, revered, figure, becomes, more, nuanced, and, complete, she, described, her, mother, as, an, invisible, presence, in, her, life, and, ellen, rosenman, argues, that, the, mother, daughter, relationship, is, a, constant, in, woolf, s, writing, she, describes, how, woolf, s, modernism, needs, to, be, viewed, in, relationship, to, her, ambivalence, towards, her, victorian, mother, the, centre, of, the, former, s, female, identity, and, her, voyage, to, her, own, sense, of, autonomy, to, woolf, saint, julia, was, both, a, martyr, whose, perfectionism, was, intimidating, and, a, source, of, deprivation, by, her, absences, real, and, virtual, and, premature, death, julia, s, influence, and, memory, pervades, woolf, s, life, and, work, she, has, haunted, me, she, wrote, according, to, the, 2007, book, feminism, from, mary, wollstonecraft, to, betty, friedan, by, bhaskar, a, shukla, recently, studies, of, virginia, woolf, have, focused, on, feminist, and, lesbian, themes, in, her, work, such, as, in, the, 1997, collection, of, critical, essays, virginia, woolf, lesbian, readings, edited, by, eileen, barrett, and, patricia, cramer, in, 1928, woolf, took, a, grassroots, approach, to, informing, and, inspiring, feminism, she, addressed, undergraduate, women, at, the, odtaa, society, at, girton, college, cambridge, and, the, arts, society, at, newnham, college, with, two, papers, that, eventually, became, a, room, of, one, s, own, 1929, woolf, s, best, known, nonfiction, works, a, room, of, one, s, own, 1929, and, three, guineas, 1938, examine, the, difficulties, that, female, writers, and, intellectuals, faced, because, men, held, disproportionate, legal, and, economic, power, as, well, as, the, future, of, women, in, education, and, society, in, the, second, sex, 1949, simone, de, beauvoir, counts, of, all, women, who, ever, lived, only, three, female, writers, emily, bront, woolf, and, sometimes, katherine, mansfield, have, explored, the, given, in, her, lifetime, woolf, was, outspoken, on, many, topics, that, were, considered, controversial, some, of, which, are, now, considered, progressive, others, regressive, she, was, an, ardent, feminist, at, a, time, when, women, s, rights, were, barely, recognised, and, anti, colonialist, anti, imperialist, and, a, pacifist, when, chauvinism, was, popular, on, the, other, hand, she, has, been, criticised, for, views, on, class, and, race, in, her, private, writings, and, published, works, like, many, of, her, contemporaries, some, of, her, writing, is, now, considered, offensive, as, a, result, she, is, considered, polarising, a, revolutionary, feminist, and, socialist, hero, or, a, purveyor, of, hate, speech, works, such, as, a, room, of, one, s, own, 1929, and, three, guineas, 1938, are, frequently, taught, as, icons, of, feminist, literature, in, courses, that, would, be, very, critical, of, some, of, her, views, expressed, elsewhere, she, has, also, been, the, recipient, of, considerable, homophobic, and, misogynist, criticism, virginia, woolf, was, born, into, a, non, religious, family, and, is, regarded, along, with, fellow, members, of, the, bloomsbury, group, e, m, forster, and, g, e, moore, as, a, humanist, both, her, parents, were, prominent, agnostic, atheists, her, father, leslie, stephen, had, become, famous, in, polite, society, for, his, writings, which, expressed, and, publicised, reasons, to, doubt, the, veracity, of, religion, stephen, was, also, president, of, the, west, london, ethical, society, an, early, humanist, organisation, and, helped, to, found, the, union, of, ethical, societies, in, 1896, woolf, s, mother, julia, stephen, wrote, the, book, agnostic, women, 1880, which, argued, that, agnosticism, defined, here, as, something, more, like, atheism, could, be, a, highly, moral, approach, to, life, woolf, was, a, critic, of, christianity, in, a, letter, to, ethel, smyth, she, gave, a, scathing, denunciation, of, the, religion, seeing, it, as, self, righteous, egotism, and, stating, my, jew, has, more, religion, in, one, toenail, more, human, love, in, one, hair, woolf, stated, in, her, private, letters, that, she, thought, of, herself, as, an, atheist, she, thought, there, were, no, gods, no, one, was, to, blame, and, so, she, evolved, this, atheist, s, religion, of, doing, good, for, the, sake, of, goodness, hermione, lee, cites, a, number, of, extracts, from, woolf, s, writings, that, many, including, lee, would, consider, offensive, and, these, criticisms, can, be, traced, back, as, far, as, those, of, wyndham, lewis, and, q, d, leavis, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, other, authors, provide, more, nuanced, contextual, interpretations, and, stress, the, complexity, of, her, character, and, the, apparent, inherent, contradictions, in, analysing, her, apparent, flaws, she, could, certainly, be, off, hand, rude, and, even, cruel, in, her, dealings, with, other, authors, translators, and, biographers, such, as, her, treatment, of, ruth, gruber, some, authors, including, david, daiches, brenda, silver, alison, light, and, other, postcolonial, feminists, dismiss, her, and, modernist, authors, in, general, as, privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and, antisemitic, woolf, s, tendentious, expressions, including, prejudicial, feelings, against, disabled, people, have, often, been, the, topic, of, academic, criticism, the, first, quotation, is, from, a, diary, entry, of, september, 1920, and, runs, the, fact, is, the,

irreligious, jewish, man, leonard, woolf, who, had, no, connection, with, or, knowledge, of, his, people, while, she, generally, characterised, jewish, characters, with, negative, stereotypes, for, instance, she, described, some, of, the, jewish, characters, in, her, work, in, terms, that, suggested, they, were, physically, repulsive, or, dirty, on, the, other, hand, she, could, criticise, her, own, views, how, i, hated, marrying, a, jew, how, i, hated, their, nasal, voices, and, their, oriental, jewellery, and, their, noses, and, their, wattles, what, a, snob, i, was, for, they, have, immense, vitality, and, i, think, i, like, that, quality, best, of, all, letter, to, ethel, smyth, 1930, these, attitudes, have, been, construed, to, reflect, not, so, much, antisemitism, but, social,

was, an, indictment, of, fascism, and, what, woolf, described, as, a, recurring, propensity, among, patriarchal, societies, to, enforce, repressive, societal, mores, by, violence, and, yet, her, 1938, story, the, duchess, and, the, jeweller, was, so, deeply, hateful, in, its, depiction, of, jews, that, harper, s, bazaar, asked, her, to, modify, it, before, publication, she, reluctantly, complied,
