from, his, past, at, one, point, golding, described, setting, his, students, up, into, two, groups, to, fight, each, other, an, experience, he, drew, on, when, writing, lord, of, the, flies, john, carey, the, emeritus, professor, of, english, literature, at, oxford, university, was, eventually, given, unprecedented, access, to, golding, s, unpublished, papers, and, journals, by, the, golding, estate, though, golding, had, not, written, the, journals, specifically, so, that, a, biography, could, be, written, about, him, carey, published, william, golding, the, man, who, wrote, lord, of,

notes, that, her, father, was, always, very, open, if, rueful, about, problems, with, drink, golding, suggested, that, his, self, described, crisis, of, which, alcoholism, played, a, major, part, had, plagued, him, his, entire, life, john, carey, mentions, several, instances, of, binge, drinking, in, his, biography, including, golding, s, experiences, in, 1963, whilst, on, holiday, in, greece, when, he, was, meant, to, have, been, finishing, his, novel, the, spire, after, working, on, his, writing, in, the, morning, he, would, go, to, his, preferred, kapheneion, to, drink, at, midday, by, the, evening, he, would, move, onto, ouzo, and, brandy, he, developed, a, reputation, locally, for, provoking, explosions, unfortunately, the, eventual, publication, of, the, spire, the, following, year, did, not, help, golding, s, developing, struggle, with, alcohol, it, had, precisely, the, opposite, effect, with, the, novel, s, scathingly, negative, reviews, in, a, bbc, radio, broadcast, affecting, him, severely, following, the, publication, of, the, pyramid, in, 1967, golding, experienced, a, severe, writer, s, block, the, result, of, myriad, crises, family, anxieties, insomnia, and, a, general, sense, of, dejection, golding, eventually, became, unable, to, deal, with, what, he, perceived, to, be, the, intense, reality, of, his, life, without, first, drinking, copious, amounts, of, alcohol, tim, kendall, suggests, that, these, experiences, manifest, in, golding, s, writing, as, the, character, wilf, in, the, paper, men, an, ageing, novelist, whose, alcohol, sodden, journeys, across, europe, are, bankrolled, by, the, continuing, success, of, his, first, book, by, the, late, 1960s, golding, was, relying, on, alcohol, which, he, referred, to, as, the, old, old, anodyne, his, first, steps, towards, recovery, came, from, his, study, of, carl, jung, s, writings, and, in, what, he, called, an, admission, of, discipleship, he, travelled, to, switzerland, in, 1971, to, see, jung, s, landscapes, for, himself, that, same, year, he, started, keeping, a, journal, in, which, he, recorded, and, interpreted, his, dreams, the, last, entry, is, from, the, day, before, he, died, in, 1993, and, the, volumes, long, work, came, to, be, thousands, of, pages, long, by, this, time, the, crisis, did, inevitably, affect, golding, s, output, and, his, next, novel, darkness, visible, would, be, published, twelve, years, after, the, pyramid, a, far, cry, from, the, prolific, author, who, had, produced, six, novels, in, thirteen, years, since, the, start, of, his, career, despite, this, the, extent, of, golding, s, recovery, is, evident, from, the, fact, that, this, was, only, the, first, of, six, further, novels, that, golding, completed, before, his, death, in, 1985, golding, and, his, wife, moved, to, a, house, called, tullimaar, in, perranarworthal, near, truro, cornwall, he, died, of, heart, failure, eight, years, later, on, 19, june, 1993, his, body, was, buried, in,

counts, the, greatest, influences, on, his, writing, first, the, war, and, his, service, in, the, navy, and, second, his, learning, ancient, greek, whilst, still, a, teacher, at, bishop, wordsworth,

after, moving, in, 1958, from, salisbury, to, nearby, bowerchalke, he, met, his, fellow, villager, and, walking, companion, james, lovelock, the, two, discussed, lovelock, s, hypothesis, that, the, living, matter, of, the, planet, earth, functions, like, a, single, organism, and, golding, suggested, naming, this, hypothesis, after, gaia, the, personification, of, the, earth, in, greek, mythology, and, mother, of, the, titans, his, publishing, success, made, it, possible, for, golding, to, resign, his, teaching, post, at, bishop, wordsworth, s, school, in, 1961, and, he, spent, that,
