the, anglosphere, where, analytic, philosophy, is, dominant, derrida, s, influence, is, most, presently, felt, in, literary, studies, due, to, his, longstanding, interest, in, language, and, his,

then, chancellor, cicerone, saying, if, the, scandalous, procedure, against, kujundzic, was, not, interrupted, or, cancelled, he, would, end, all, his, relations, with, uci, regarding, his, archival, papers, there, would, be, another, consequence, since, i, never, take, back, what, i, have, given, my, papers, would, of, course, remain, the, property, of, uci, and, the, special, collections, department, of, the, library, however, it, goes, without, saying, that, the, spirit, in, which, i, contributed, to, the, constitution, of, these, archives, which, is, still, underway, and, growing, every, year, would, have, been, seriously, damaged, without, renouncing, my, commitments, i, would, regret, having, made, them, and, would, reduce, their, fulfillment, to, the, barest, minimum, after, derrida, s, death, his, widow, and, sons, said, they, wanted, copies, of, uci, s, archives, shared, with, the, institute, of, contemporary, publishing, archives, in, france, the, university, had,

derrida, s, work, does, not, meet, accepted, standards, of, clarity, and, rigour, and, academic, status, based, on, what, seems, to, us, to, be, little, more, than, semi, intelligible, attacks, upon, the, values, of, reason, truth, and, scholarship, is, not, we, submit, sufficient, grounds, for, the, awarding, of, an, honorary, degree, in, a, distinguished, university, late, in, his, life, derrida, participated, in, making, two, biographical, documentaries, d, ailleurs, derrida, derrida, s, elsewhere, by, safaa, fathy, 1999, and, derrida, by, kirby, dick, and, amy, ziering, kofman, 2002, on, 19, february, 2003, with, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, impending, ren, major, moderated, a, debate, entitled, pourquoi, la, guerre, aujourd, hui, between, derrida, and, jean, baudrillard, co, hosted, by, major, s, institute, for, advanced, studies, in, psychoanalysis, and, le, monde, diplomatique, the, debate, discussed, the, relation, between, terrorist, attacks, and, the, invasion, in, june, 1957, he, married, the, psychoanalyst, marguerite, aucouturier, in, boston, derrida, was, diagnosed, with, pancreatic, cancer, in, 2002, he, died, during, surgery, in, a, hospital, in, paris, in, the, early, hours, of, 9, october, 2004, at, the, time, of, his, death, derrida, had, agreed, to, go, for, the, summer, to, university, of, heidelberg, as, holder, of, the, gadamer, professorship, whose, invitation, was, expressed, by, the, hermeneutic, philosopher, himself, before, his, death, peter, hommelhoff, rector, at, heidelberg, by, that, time, would, summarize, derrida, s, place, as, beyond, the, boundaries, of, philosophy, as, an, academic, discipline, he, was, a, leading, intellectual, figure, not, only, for, the, humanities, but, for, the, cultural, perception, of, a, whole, age, derrida, referred, to, himself, as, a, historian, he, questioned, assumptions, of, the, western, philosophical, tradition, and, also, more, broadly, western, culture, by, questioning, the, dominant, discourses, and, trying, to, modify, them, he, attempted, to, democratize, the, university, scene, and, to, politicize, it, derrida, called, his, challenge, to, the, assumptions, of, western, culture, deconstruction, on, some, occasions, derrida, referred, to, deconstruction, as, a, radicalization, of, a, certain, spirit, of, marxism, with, his, detailed, readings, of, works, from, plato, to, rousseau, to, heidegger, derrida, frequently, argues, that, western, philosophy, has, uncritically, allowed, metaphorical, depth, models, to, govern, its, conception, of, language, and, consciousness, he, sees, these, often, unacknowledged, assumptions, as, part, of, a, metaphysics, of, presence, to, which, philosophy, has, bound, itself, this, logocentrism, derrida, argues, creates, marked, or, hierarchized, binary, oppositions, that, have, an, effect, on, everything, from, the, conception, of, speech, s, relation, to, writing, to, the, understanding, of, racial, difference, deconstruction, is, an, attempt, to, expose, and, undermine, such, metaphysics, derrida, approaches, texts, as, constructed, around, binary, oppositions, which, all, speech, has, to, articulate, if, it, intends, to, make, any, sense, whatsoever, this, approach, to, text, is, in, a, broad, sense, influenced, by, the, semiology, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, saussure, considered, to, be, one, of, the, fathers, of, structuralism, posited, that, terms, get, their, meaning, in, reciprocal, determination, with, other, terms, inside, language, perhaps, derrida, s, most, quoted, and, famous, assertion, which, appears, in, an, essay, on, rousseau, in, his, book, of, grammatology, 1967, is, the, statement, that, there, is, no, outside, text, il, n, y, a, pas, de, hors, texte, critics, of, derrida, have, been, often, accused, of, having, mistranslated, the, phrase, in, french, to, suggest, he, had, written, il, n, y, a, rien, en, dehors, du, texte, there, is, nothing, outside, the, text, and, of, having, widely, disseminated, this, translation, to, make, it, appear, that, derrida, is, suggesting, that, nothing, exists, but, words, derrida, once, explained, that, this, assertion, which, for, some, has, become, a, sort, of, slogan, in, general, so, badly, understood, of, deconstruction, means, nothing, else, there, is, nothing, outside, context, in, this, form, which, says, exactly, the, same, thing, the, formula, would, doubtless, have, been, less, shocking, derrida, began, his, career, examining, the, limits, of, phenomenology, his, first, lengthy, academic, manuscript, written, as, a, dissertation, for, his, dipl, me, d, tudes, sup, rieures, and, submitted, in, 1954, concerned, the, work, of, edmund, husserl, gary, banham, has, said, that, the, dissertation, is, in, many, respects, the, most, ambitious, of, derrida, s, interpretations, with, husserl, not, merely, in, terms, of, the, number, of, works, addressed, but, also, in, terms, of, the, extraordinarily, focused, nature, of, its, investigation, in, 1962, he, published, edmund, husserl, s, origin, of, geometry, an, introduction, which, contained, his, own, translation, of, husserl, s, essay, many, elements, of, derrida, s, thought, were, already, present, in, this, work, in, the, interviews, collected, in, positions, 1972, derrida, said, in, this, essay, the, problematic, of, writing, was, already, in, place, as, such, bound, to, the, irreducible, structure, of, deferral, in, its, relationships, to, consciousness, presence, science, history, and, the, history, of, science, the, disappearance, or, delay, of, the, origin, etc, this, essay, can, be, read, as, the, other, side, recto, or, verso, as, you, wish, of, speech, and, phenomena, derrida, first, received, major, attention, outside, france, with, his, lecture, structure, sign, and, play, in, the, discourse, of, the, human, sciences, delivered, at, johns, hopkins, university, in, 1966, and, subsequently, included, in, writing, and, difference, the, conference, at, which, this, paper, was, delivered, was, concerned, with, structuralism, then, at, the, peak, of, its, influence, in, france, but, only, beginning, to, gain, attention, in, the, united, states, derrida, differed, from, other, participants, by, his, lack, of, explicit, commitment, to, structuralism, having, already, been, critical, of, the, movement, he, praised, the, accomplishments, of, structuralism, but, also, maintained, reservations, about, its, internal, limitations, this, has, led, us, academics, to, label, his, thought, as, a, form, of, post, structuralism, the, effect, of, derrida, s, paper, was, such, that, by, the, time, the, conference, proceedings, were, published, in, 1970, the, title, of, the, collection, had, become, the, structuralist, controversy, the, conference, was, also, where, he, met, paul, de, man, who, would, be, a, close, friend, and, source, of, great, controversy, as, well, as, where, he, first, met, the, french, psychoanalyst, jacques, lacan, with, whose, work, derrida, had, a, mixed, relationship, in, the, early, 1960s, derrida, began, speaking, and, writing, publicly, addressing, the, most, topical, debates, at, the, time, one, of, these, was, the, new, and, increasingly, fashionable, movement, of, structuralism, which, was, being, widely, favoured, as, the, successor, to, the, phenomenology, approach, the, latter, having, been, started, by, husserl, sixty, years, earlier, derrida, s, countercurrent, take, on, the, issue, at, a, prominent, international, conference, was, so, influential, that, it, reframed, the, discussion, from, a, celebration, of, the, triumph, of, structuralism, to, a, phenomenology, vs, structuralism, debate, phenomenology, as, envisioned, by, husserl, is, a, method, of, philosophical, inquiry, that, rejects, the, rationalist, bias, that, has, dominated, western, thought, since, plato, in, favor, of, a, method, of, reflective, attentiveness, that, discloses, the, individual, s, lived, experience, for, those, with, a, more, phenomenological, bent, the, goal, was, to, understand, experience, by, comprehending, and, describing, its, genesis, the, process, of, its, emergence, from, an, origin, or, event, for, the, structuralists, this, was, a, false, problem, and, the, depth, of, experience, could, in, fact, only, be, an, effect, of, structures, which, are, not, themselves, experiential, in, that, context, in, 1959, derrida, asked, the, question, must, not, structure, have, a, genesis, and, must, not, the, origin, the, point, of, genesis, be, already, structured, in, order, to, be, the, genesis, of, something, in, other, words, every, structural, or, synchronic, phenomenon, has, a, history, and, the, structure, cannot, be, understood, without, understanding, its, genesis, at, the, same, time, in, order, that, there, be, movement, or, potential, the, origin, cannot, be, some, pure, unity, or, simplicity, but, must, already, be, articulated, complex, such, that, from, it, a, diachronic, process, can, emerge, this, original, complexity, must, not, be, understood, as, an, original, positing, but, more, like, a, default, of, origin, which, derrida, refers, to, as, iterability, inscription, or, textuality, it, is, this, thought, of, originary, complexity, that, sets, derrida, s, work, in, motion, and, from, which, all, of, its, terms, are, derived, including, deconstruction, derrida, s, method, consisted, in, demonstrating, the, forms, and, varieties, of, this, originary, complexity, and, their, multiple, consequences, in, many, fields, he, achieved, this, by, conducting, thorough, careful, sensitive, and, yet, transformational, readings, of, philosophical, and, literary, texts, to, determine, what, aspects, of, those, texts, run, counter, to, their, apparent, systematicity, structural, unity, or, intended, sense, authorial, genesis, by, demonstrating, the, aporias, and, ellipses, of, thought, derrida, hoped, to, show, the, infinitely, subtle, ways, in, which, this, originary, complexity, which, by, definition, cannot, ever, be, completely, known, works, its, structuring, and, destructuring, effects, derrida, s, interests, crossed, disciplinary, boundaries, and, his, knowledge, of, a, wide, array, of, diverse, material, was, reflected, in, the, three, collections, of, work, published, in, 1967, speech, and, phenomena, of, grammatology, initially, submitted, as, a, doctorat, de, sp, cialit, thesis, under, maurice, de, gandillac, and, writing, and, difference, on, several, occasions, derrida, has, acknowledged, his, debt, to, husserl, and, heidegger, and, stated, that, without, them, he, would, not, have, said, a, single, word, among, the, questions, asked, in, these, essays, are, what, is, meaning, what, are, its, historical, relationships, to, what, is, purportedly, identified, under, the, rubric, voice, as, a, value, of, presence, presence, of, the, object, presence, of, meaning, to, consciousness, self, presence, in, so, called, living, speech, and, in, self, consciousness, in, another, essay, in, writing, and, difference, entitled, violence, and, metaphysics, an, essay, on, the, thought, of, emmanuel, levinas, the, roots, of, another, major, theme, in, derrida, s, thought, emerge, the, other, as, opposed, to, the, same, deconstructive, analysis, deprives, the, present, of, its, prestige, and, exposes, it, to, something, tout, autre, wholly, other, beyond, what, is, foreseeable, from, the, present, beyond, the, horizon, of, the, same, other, than, rousseau, husserl, heidegger, and, levinas, these, three, books, discussed, and, or, relied, upon, the, works, of, many, philosophers, and, authors, including, linguist, saussure, hegel, foucault, bataille, descartes, anthropologist, l, vi, strauss, paleontologist, leroi, gourhan, psychoanalyst, freud, and, writers, such, as, jab, s, and, artaud, this, collection, of, three, books, published, in, 1967, elaborated, derrida, s, theoretical, framework, derrida, attempts, to, approach, the, very, heart, of, the, western, intellectual, tradition, characterizing, this, tradition, as, a, search, for, a, transcendental, being, that, serves, as, the, origin, or, guarantor, of, meaning, the, attempt, to, ground, the, meaning, relations, constitutive, of, the, world, in, an, instance, that, itself, lies, outside, all, relationality, was, referred, to, by, heidegger, as, logocentrism, and, derrida, argues, that, the, philosophical, enterprise, is, essentially, logocentric, and, that, this, is, a, paradigm, inherited, from, judaism, and, hellenism, he, in, turn, describes, logocentrism, as, phallocratic, patriarchal, and, masculinist, derrida, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, certain, deeply, hidden, philosophical, presuppositions, and, prejudices, in, western, culture, arguing, that, the, whole, philosophical, tradition, rests, on, arbitrary, dichotomous, categories, such, as, sacred, profane, signifier, signified, mind, body, and, that, any, text, contains, implicit, hierarchies, by, which, an, order, is, imposed, on, reality, and, by, which, a, subtle, repression, is, exercised, as, these, hierarchies, exclude, subordinate, and, hide, the, various, potential, meanings, derrida, refers, to, his, procedure, for, uncovering, and, unsettling, these, dichotomies, as, deconstruction, of, western, culture, in, 1968, he, published, his, influential, essay, plato, s, pharmacy, in, the, french, journal, tel, quel, this, essay, was, later, collected, in, dissemination, one, of, three, books, published, by, derrida, in, 1972, along, with, the, essay, collection, margins, of, philosophy, and, the, collection, of, interviews, entitled, positions, starting, in, 1972, derrida, produced, on, average, more, than, one, book, per, year, derrida, continued, to, produce, important, works, such, as, glas, 1974, and, the, post, card, from, socrates, to, freud, and, beyond, 1980, derrida, received, increasing, attention, in, the, united, states, after, 1972, where, he, was, a, regular, visiting, professor, and, lecturer, at, several, major, american, universities, in, the, 1980s, during, the, american, culture, wars, conservatives, started, a, dispute, over, derrida, s, influence, and, legacy, upon, american, intellectuals, and, claimed, that, he, influenced, american, literary, critics, and, theorists, more, than, academic, philosophers, on, 14, march, 1987, derrida, presented, at, the, ciph, conference, entitled, heidegger, open, questions, a, lecture, which, was, published, in, october, 1987, as, of, spirit, heidegger, and, the, question, it, follows, the, shifting, role, of, geist, spirit, through, heidegger, s, work, noting, that, in, 1927, spirit, was, one, of, the, philosophical, terms, that, heidegger, set, his, sights, on, dismantling, with, his, nazi, political, engagement, in, 1933, however, heidegger, came, out, as, a, champion, of, the, german, spirit, and, only, withdrew, from, an, exalting, interpretation, of, the, term, in, 1953, derrida, asks, what, of, this, meantime, his, book, connects, in, a, number, of, respects, with, his, long, engagement, of, heidegger, such, as, the, ends, of, man, in, margins, of, philosophy, his, paris, seminar, on, philosophical, nationality, and, nationalism, in, the, mid, 1980s, and, the, essays, published, in, english, as, geschlecht, and, geschlecht, ii, he, considers, four, guiding, threads, of, heideggerian, philosophy, that, form, the, knot, of, this, geflecht, the, question, of, the, question, the, essence, of, technology, the, discourse, of, animality, and, epochality, or, the, hidden, teleology, or, the, narrative, order, of, spirit, contributes, to, the, long, debate, on, heidegger, s, nazism, and, appeared, at, the, same, time, as, the, french, publication, of, a, book, by, a, previously, unknown, chilean, writer, victor, far, as, who, charged, that, heidegger, s, philosophy, amounted, to, a, wholehearted, endorsement, of, the, nazi, sturmabteilung, sa, faction, derrida, responded, to, far, as, in, an, interview, heidegger, the, philosopher, s, hell, and, a, subsequent, article, comment, donner, raison, how, to, concede, with, reasons, he, called, far, as, a, weak, reader, of, heidegger, s, thought, adding, that, much, of, the, evidence, far, as, and, his, supporters, touted, as, new, had, long, been, known, within, the, philosophical, community, some, have, argued, that, derrida, s, work, took, a, political, and, ethical, turn, in, the, 1990s, texts, cited, as, evidence, of, such, a, turn, include, force, of, law, 1990, as, well, as, specters, of, marx, 1994, and, politics, of, friendship, 1994, some, refer, to, the, gift, of, death, as, evidence, that, he, began, more, directly, applying, deconstruction, to, the, relationship, between, ethics, and, religion, in, this, work, derrida, interprets, passages, from, the, bible, particularly, on, abraham, and, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, and, from, s, ren, kierkegaard, s, fear, and, trembling, however, scholars, such, as, leonard, lawlor, robert, magliola, and, nicole, anderson, have, argued, that, the, turn, has, been, exaggerated, some, including, derrida, himself, have, argued, that, much, of, the, philosophical, work, done, in, his, political, turn, can, be, dated, to, earlier, essays, derrida, develops, an, ethicist, view, respecting, to, hospitality, exploring, the, idea, that, two, types, of, hospitalities, exist, conditional, and, unconditional, though, this, contributed, to, the, works, of, many, scholars, derrida, was, seriously, criticized, for, this, derrida, s, contemporary, readings, of, emmanuel, levinas, walter, benjamin, carl, schmitt, jan, pato, ka, on, themes, such, as, law, justice, responsibility, and, friendship, had, a, significant, impact, on, fields, beyond, philosophy, derrida, and, deconstruction, influenced, aesthetics, literary, criticism, architecture, film, theory, anthropology, sociology, historiography, law, psychoanalysis, theology, feminism, gay, and, lesbian, studies, and, political, theory, jean, luc, nancy, richard, rorty, geoffrey, hartman, harold, bloom, rosalind, krauss, h, l, ne, cixous, julia, kristeva, duncan, kennedy, gary, peller, drucilla, cornell, alan, hunt, hayden, white, mario, kopi, and, alun, munslow, are, some, of, the, authors, who, have, been, influenced, by, deconstruction, derrida, delivered, a, eulogy, at, levinas, funeral, later, published, as, adieu, emmanuel, l, vinas, an, appreciation, and, exploration, of, levinas, s, moral, philosophy, derrida, used, bracha, l, ettinger, s, interpretation, of, l, vinas, notion, of, femininity, and, transformed, his, own, earlier, reading, of, this, subject, respectively, derrida, continued, to, produce, readings, of, literature, writing, extensively, on, maurice, blanchot, paul, celan, and, others, in, 1991, he, published, the, other, heading, in, which, he, discussed, the, concept, of, identity, as, in, cultural, identity, european, identity, and, national, identity, in, the, name, of, which, in, europe, have, been, unleashed, the, worst, violences, the, crimes, of, xenophobia, racism, anti, semitism, religious, or, nationalist, fanaticism, at, the, 1997, cerisy, conference, derrida, delivered, a, ten, hour, address, on, the, subject, of, the, autobiographical, animal, entitled, the, animal, that, therefore, i, am, more, to, follow, engaging, with, questions, surrounding, the, ontology, of, nonhuman, animals, the, ethics, of, animal, slaughter, and, the, difference, between, humans, and, other, animals, the, address, has, been, seen, as, initiating, a, late, animal, turn, in, derrida, s, philosophy, although, derrida, himself, has, said, that, his, interest, in, animals, is, present, in, his, earliest, writings, beginning, with, the, deaths, of, roland, barthes, in, 1981, derrida, produced, a, series, of, texts, on, mourning, and, memory, occasioned, by, the, loss, of, his, friends, and, colleagues, many, of, them, new, engagements, with, their, work, memoires, for, paul, de, man, a, book, length, lecture, series, presented, first, at, yale, and, then, at, irvine, as, derrida, s, wellek, lecture, followed, in, 1986, with, a, revision, in, 1989, that, included, like, the, sound, of, the, sea, deep, within, a, shell, paul, de, man, s, war, ultimately, fourteen, essays, were, collected, into, the, work, of, mourning, 2001, which, was, expanded, in, the, 2003, french, edition, chaque, fois, unique, la, fin, du, monde, literally, unique, each, time, the, end, of, the, world, to, include, essays, dedicated, to, g, rard, granel, and, maurice, blanchot, in, october, 2002, at, the, theatrical, opening, of, the, film, derrida, he, said, that, in, many, ways, he, felt, more, and, more, close, to, guy, debord, s, work, and, that, this, closeness, appears, in, derrida, s, texts, derrida, mentioned, in, particular, everything, i, say, about, the, media, technology, the, spectacle, and, the, criticism, of, the, show, so, to, speak, and, the, markets, the, becoming, a, spectacle, of, everything, and, the, exploitation, of, the, spectacle, among, the, places, in, which, derrida, mentions, the, spectacle, is, a, 1997, interview, about, the, notion, of, the, intellectual, derrida, engaged, with, a, variety, of, political, issues, movements, and, debates, throughout, his, career, in, 1968, he, participated, in, the, may, 68, protests, in, france, and, met, frequently, with, maurice, blanchot, however, he, expressed, concerns, about, the, cult, of, spontaneity, and, anti, unionist, euphoria, that, he, observed, he, also, registered, his, objections, to, the, vietnam, war, in, a, lecture, he, gave, in, the, united, states, derrida, signed, a, petition, against, age, of, consent, laws, in, 1977, and, in, 1981, he, founded, the, french, jan, hus, association, to, support, dissident, czech, intellectuals, in, 1981, derrida, was, arrested, by, the, czechoslovakian, government, for, leading, a, conference, without, authorization, and, charged, with, drug, trafficking, although, he, claimed, the, drugs, were, planted, on, him, he, was, released, with, the, help, of, the, mitterrand, government, and, michel, foucault, derrida, was, an, advocate, for, nuclear, disarmament, protested, against, apartheid, in, south, africa, and, met, with, palestinian, intellectuals, during, a, visit, to, jerusalem, in, 1988, he, also, opposed, capital, punishment, and, was, involved, in, the, campaign, to, free, mumia, abu, jamal, although, derrida, was, not, associated, with, any, political, party, until, 1995, he, supported, the, socialist, candidacy, of, lionel, jospin, despite, misgivings, about, such, organizations, in, the, 2002, french, presidential, election, he, refused, to, vote, in, the, run, off, election, between, far, right, candidate, jean, marie, le, pen, and, center, right, jacques, chirac, citing, a, lack, of, acceptable, choices, derrida, opposed, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, and, was, engaged, in, rethinking, politics, and, the, political, itself, within, and, beyond, philosophy, he, focused, on, understanding, the, political, implications, of, notions, such, as, responsibility, reason, of, state, decision, sovereignty, and, democracy, by, 2000, he, was, theorizing, democracy, to, come, and, thinking, about, the, limitations, of, existing, democracies, crucial, readings, in, his, adolescence, were, rousseau, s, reveries, of, a, solitary, walker, and, confessions, andr, gide, s, journal, la, porte, troite, les, nourritures, terrestres, and, the, immoralist, and, the, works, of, friedrich, nietzsche, the, phrase, families, i, hate, you, in, particular, which, inspired, derrida, as, an, adolescent, is, a, famous, verse, from, gide, s, les, nourritures, terrestres, book, iv, in, a, 1991, interview, derrida, commented, on, a, similar, verse, also, from, book, iv, of, the, same, gide, work, i, hated, the, homes, the, families, all, the, places, where, man, thinks, he, ll, find, rest, je, ha, ssais, les, foyers, les, familles, tous, lieux, o, l, homme, pense, trouver, un, repos, other, influences, upon, derrida,

this, philosopher, and, talmudic, scholar, who, practiced, the, phenomenological, encounter, with, the, other, in, the, form, of, the, face, which, commanded, human, response, the, use, of, deconstruction, to, read, jewish, texts, like, the, talmud, is, relatively, rare, but, has, recently, been, attempted, derrida, s, philosophical, friends, allies, students, and, the, heirs, of,

lacoue, labarthe, were, among, derrida, s, first, students, in, france, and, went, on, to, become, well, known, and, important, philosophers, in, their, own, right, despite, their, considerable, differences, of, subject, and, often, also, of, a, method, they, continued, their, close, interaction, with, each, other, and, with, derrida, from, the, early, 1970s, derrida, wrote, on, both, of, them, including, a, long, book, on, nancy, le, toucher, jean, luc, nancy, on, touching, jean, luc, nancy, 2005, derrida, s, most, prominent, friendship, in, intellectual, life, was, with, paul, de, man, which, began, with, their, meeting, at, johns, hopkins, university, and, continued, until, de, man, s, death, in, 1983, de, man, provided, a, somewhat, different, approach, to, deconstruction, and, his, readings, of, literary, and, philosophical, texts, were, crucial, in, the, training, of, a, generation, of, readers, shortly, after, de, man, s, death, derrida, wrote, the, book, memoires, pour, paul, de, man, and, in, 1988, wrote, an, article, in, the, journal, critical, inquiry, called, like, the, sound, of, the, sea, deep, within, a, shell, paul, de, man, s, war, the, memoir, became, cause, for, controversy, because, shortly, before, derrida, published, his, piece, it, had, been, discovered, by, the, belgian, literary, critic, ortwin, de, graef, that, long, before, his, academic, career, in, the, us, de, man, had, written, almost, two, hundred, essays, in, a, pro, nazi, newspaper, during, the, german, occupation, of, belgium, including, several, that, were, explicitly, antisemitic, critics, of, derrida, have, argued, that, he, minimizes, the, antisemitic, character, of, de, man, s, writing, some, critics, have, found, derrida, s, treatment, of, this, issue, surprising, given, that, for, example, derrida, also, spoke, out, against, antisemitism, and, in, the, 1960s, broke, with, the, heidegger, disciple, jean, beaufret, over, beaufret, s, instances, of, antisemitism, about, which, derrida, and, after, him, maurice, blanchot, expressed, shock, derrida, s, criticism, of, foucault, appears, in, the, essay, cogito, and, the, history, of, madness, from, writing, and, difference, it, was, first, given, as, a, lecture, on, 4, march, 1963, at, a, conference, at, wahl, s, coll, ge, philosophique, which, foucault, attended, and, caused, a, rift, between, the, two, men, that, was, never, fully, mended, in, an, appendix, added, to, the, 1972, edition, of, his, history, of, madness, foucault, disputed, derrida, s, interpretation, of, his, work, and, accused, derrida, of, practicing, a, historically, well, determined, little, pedagogy, which, teaches, the, student, that, there, is, nothing, outside, the, text, a, pedagogy, which, inversely, gives, to, the, voice, of, the, masters, that, infinite, sovereignty, that, allows, it, indefinitely, to, re, say, the, text, according, to, historian, carlo, ginzburg, foucault, may, have, written, the, order, of, things, 1966, and, the, archaeology, of, knowledge, partly, under, the, stimulus, of, derrida, s, criticism, carlo, ginzburg, briefly, labeled, derrida, s, criticism, in, cogito, and, the, history, of, madness, as, facile, nihilistic, objections, without, giving, further, argumentation, geoffrey, bennington, avital, ronell, and, samuel, weber, belong, to, a, group, of, derrida, translators, many, of, derrida, s, translators, are, esteemed, thinkers, in, their, own, right, derrida, often, worked, in, a, collaborative, arrangement, allowing, his, prolific, output, to, be, translated, into, english, in, a, timely, fashion, having, started, as, a, student, of, de, man, gayatri, spivak, took, on, the, translation, of, of, grammatology, early, in, her, career, and, has, since, revised, it, into, a, second, edition, barbara, johnson, s, translation, of, derrida, s, dissemination, was, published, by, the, athlone, press, in, 1981, alan, bass, was, responsible, for, several, early, translations, bennington, and, peggy, kamuf, have, continued, to, produce, translations, of, his, work, for, nearly, twenty, years, in, recent, years, a, number, of, translations, have, appeared, by, michael, naas, also, a, derrida, scholar, and, pascale, anne, brault, bennington, brault, kamuf, naas, elizabeth, rottenberg, and, david, wills, are, currently, engaged, in, translating, derrida, s, previously, unpublished, seminars, which, span, from, 1959, to, 2003, volumes, i, and, ii, of, the, beast, and, the, sovereign, presenting, derrida, s, seminars, from, 12, december, 2001, to, 27, march, 2002, and, from, 11, december, 2002, to, 26, march, 2003, as, well, as, the, death, penalty, volume, i, covering, 8, december, 1999, to, 22, march, 2000, have, appeared, in, english, translation, further, volumes, currently, projected, for, the, series, include, heidegger, the, question, of, being, and, history, 1964, 1965, death, penalty, volume, ii, 2000, 2001, perjury, and, pardon, volume, i, 1997, 1998, and, perjury, and, pardon, volume, ii, 1998, 1999, with, bennington, derrida, undertook, the, challenge, published, as, jacques, derrida, an, arrangement, in, which, bennington, attempted, to, provide, a, systematic, explication, of, derrida, s, work, called, the, derridabase, using, the, top, two, thirds, of, every, page, while, derrida, was, given, the, finished, copy, of, every, bennington, chapter, and, the, bottom, third, of, every, page, in, which, to, show, how, deconstruction, exceeded, bennington, s, account, this, was, called, the, circumfession, derrida, seems, to, have, viewed, bennington, in, particular, as, a, kind, of, rabbinical, explicator, noting, at, the, end, of, the, applied, derrida, conference, held, at, the, university, of, luton, in, 1995, that, everything, has, been, said, and, as, usual, geoff, bennington, has, said, everything, before, i, have, even, opened, my, mouth, i, have, the, challenge, of, trying, to, be, unpredictable, after, him, which, is, impossible, so, i, ll, try, to, pretend, to, be, unpredictable, after, geoff, once, again, derrida, was, familiar, with, the, work, of, marshall, mcluhan, and, since, his, early, 1967, writings, of, grammatology, speech, and, phenomena, he, speaks, of, language, as, a, medium, of, phonetic, writing, as, the, medium, of, the, great, metaphysical, scientific, technical, and, economic, adventure, of, the, west, he, expressed, his, disagreement, with, mcluhan, in, regard, to, what, derrida, called, mcluhan, s, ideology, about, the, end, of, writing, in, a, 1982, interview, he, said, i, think, that, there, is, an, ideology, in, mcluhan, s, discourse, that, i, don, t, agree, with, because, he, s, an, optimist, as, to, the, possibility, of, restoring, an, oral, community, which, would, get, rid, of, the, writing, machines, and, so, on, i, think, that, s, a, very, traditional, myth, which, goes, back, to, let, s, say, plato, rousseau, and, instead, of, thinking, that, we, are, living, at, the, end, of, writing, i, think, that, in, another, sense, we, are, living, in, the, extension, the, overwhelming, extension, of, writing, at, least, in, the, new, sense, i, don, t, mean, the, alphabetic, writing, down, but, in, the, new, sense, of, those, writing, machines, that, we, re, using, now, e, g, the, tape, recorder, and, this, is, writing, too, and, in, his, 1972, essay, signature, event, context, he, said, as, writing, communication, if, one, insists, upon, maintaining, the, word, is, not, the, means, of, transport, of, sense, the, exchange, of, intentions, and, meanings, the, discourse, and, communication, of, consciousnesses, we, are, not, witnessing, an, end, of, writing, which, to, follow, mcluhan, s, ideological, representation, would, restore, a, transparency, or, immediacy, of, social, relations, but, indeed, a, more, and, more, powerful, historical, unfolding, of, a, general, writing, of, which, the, system, of, speech, consciousness, meaning, presence, truth, etc, would, only, be, an, effect, to, be, analyzed, as, such, it, is, this, questioned, effect, that, i, have, elsewhere, called, logocentrism, derrida, had, a, direct, impact, on, the, theories, and, practices, of, influential, architects, peter, eisenman, and, bernard, tschumi, towards, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, derrida, impacted, a, project, that, was, theorized, by, eisenman, in, chora, l, works, jacques, derrida, and, peter, eisenman, this, design, was, architecturally, conceived, by, tschumi, for, the, parc, de, la, villette, in, paris, which, included, a, sieve, or, harp, like, structure, that, derrida, envisaged, as, a, physical, metaphor, for, the, receptacle, like, properties, of, the, kh, ra, moreover, derrida, s, commentaries, on, plato, s, notion, of, kh, ra, as, set, in, the, timaeus, 48e4, received, later, reflections, in, the, philosophical, works, and, architectural, writings, of, the, philosopher, architect, nader, el, bizri, within, the, domain, of, phenomenology, derrida, used, to, name, a, radical, otherness, that, gives, place, for, being, el, bizri, built, on, this, by, more, narrowly, taking, kh, ra, to, name, the, radical, happening, of, an, ontological, difference, between, being, and, beings, el, bizri, s, reflections, on, kh, ra, are, taken, as, a, basis, for, tackling, the, meditations, on, dwelling, and, on, being, and, space, in, heidegger, s, thought, and, the, critical, conceptions, of, space, and, place, as, they, evolved, in, architectural, theory, and, its, strands, in, phenomenological, thinking, and, in, history, of, philosophy, and, science, with, a, focus, on, geometry, and, optics, this, also, describes, el, bizri, s, take, on, econtology, as, an, extension, of, heidegger, s, consideration, of, the, question, of, being, seinsfrage, by, way, of, the, fourfold, das, geviert, of, earth, sky, mortals, divinities, erde, und, himmel, sterblichen, und, g, ttlichen, and, as, also, impacted, by, his, own, meditations, on, derrida, s, take, on, ecology, is, hence, co, entangled, with, ontology, whereby, the, worldly, existential, analytics, are, grounded, in, earthiness, and, environmentalism, is, orientated, by, ontological, thinking, derrida, argued, that, the, subjectile, is, like, plato, s, kh, ra, greek, for, space, receptacle, or, site, plato, proposes, that, kh, ra, rests, between, the, sensible, and, the, intelligible, through, which, everything, passes, but, in, which, nothing, is, retained, for, example, an, image, needs, to, be, held, by, something, just, as, a, mirror, will, hold, a, reflection, for, derrida, kh, ra, defies, attempts, at, naming, or, the, either, or, logic, which, he, deconstructed, in, a, paper, entitled, ghostwriting, gayatri, chakravorty, spivak, the, translator, of, derrida, s, de, la, grammatologie, of, grammatology, into, english, criticised, derrida, s, understanding, of, marx, commenting, on, derrida, s, specters, of, marx, terry, eagleton, wrote, the, portentousness, is, ingrained, in, the, very, letter, of, this, book, as, one, theatrically, inflected, rhetorical, question, tumbles, hard, on, the, heels, of, another, in, a, tiresomely, mannered, syntax, which, lays, itself, wide, open, to, parody, though, derrida, addressed, the, american, philosophical, association, on, at, least, one, occasion, in, 1988, and, was, highly, regarded, by, some, contemporary, philosophers, like, richard, rorty, alexander, nehamas, and, stanley, cavell, his, work, has, been, regarded, by, other, analytic, philosophers, such, as, john, searle, and, willard, van, orman, quine, as, pseudophilosophy, or, sophistry, some, analytic, philosophers, have, in, fact, claimed, since, at, least, the, 1980s, that, derrida, s, work, is, not, philosophy, one, of, the, main, arguments, they, gave, was, alleging, that, derrida, s, influence, had, not, been, on, us, philosophy, departments, but, on, literature, and, other, humanities, disciplines, in, his, 1989, contingency, irony, and, solidarity, richard, rorty, argues, that, derrida, especially, in, his, book, the, post, card, from, socrates, to, freud, and, beyond, one, section, of, which, is, an, experiment, in, fiction, purposefully, uses, words, that, cannot, be, defined, e, g, diff, rance, and, uses, previously, definable, words, in, contexts, diverse, enough, to, make, understanding, impossible, so, that, the, reader, will, never, be, able, to, contextualize, derrida, s, literary, self, rorty, however, argues, that, this, intentional, obfuscation, is, philosophically, grounded, in, garbling, his, message, derrida, is, attempting, to, escape, the, na, ve, positive, metaphysical, projects, of, his, predecessors, roger, scruton, wrote, in, 2004, he, s, difficult, to, summarise, because, it, s, nonsense, he, argues, that, the, meaning, of, a, sign, is, never, revealed, in, the, sign, but, deferred, indefinitely, and, that, a, sign, only, means, something, by, virtue, of, its, difference, from, something, else, for, derrida, there, is, no, such, thing, as, meaning, it, always, eludes, us, and, therefore, anything, goes, on, derrida, s, scholarship, and, writing, style, noam, chomsky, wrote, i, found, the, scholarship, appalling, based, on, pathetic, misreading, and, the, argument, such, as, it, was, failed, to, come, close, to, the, kinds, of, standards, i, ve, been, familiar, with, since, virtually, childhood, well, maybe, i, missed, something, could, be, but, suspicions, remain, as, noted, paul, r, gross, and, norman, levitt, also, criticized, his, work, for, misusing, scientific, terms, and, concepts, in, higher, superstition, the, academic, left, and, its, quarrels, with, science, 1994, three, quarrels, or, disputes, in, particular, went, out, of, academic, circles, and, received, international, mass, media, coverage, the, 1972, 88, quarrel, with, john, searle, the, analytic, philosophers, pressures, on, cambridge, university, not, to, award, derrida, an, honorary, degree, and, a, dispute, with, richard, wolin, and, the, nyrb, in, 1992, some, academics, at, cambridge, university, mostly, not, from, the, philosophy, faculty, proposed, that, derrida, be, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, this, was, opposed, by, among, others, the, university, s, professor, of, philosophy, hugh, mellor, eighteen, other, philosophers, from, us, austrian, australian, french, polish, italian, german, dutch, swiss, spanish, and, british, institutions, including, barry, smith, willard, van, orman, quine, david, armstrong, ruth, barcan, marcus, and, ren, thom, then, sent, a, letter, to, cambridge, claiming, that, derrida, s, work, does, not, meet, accepted, standards, of, clarity, and, rigour, and, describing, derrida, s, philosophy, as, being, composed, of, tricks, and, gimmicks, similar, to, those, of, the, dadaists, the, letter, concluded, that, where, coherent, assertions, are, being, made, at, all, these, are, either, false, or, trivial, academic, status, based, on, what, seems, to, us, to, be, little, more, than, semi, intelligible, attacks, upon, the, values, of, reason, truth, and, scholarship, is, not, we, submit, sufficient, grounds, for, the, awarding, of, an, honorary, degree, in, a, distinguished, university, in, the, end, the, protesters, were, outnumbered, 336, votes, to, 204, when, cambridge, put, the, motion, to, a, formal, ballot, though, almost, all, of, those, who, proposed, derrida, and, who, voted, in, favour, were, not, from, the, philosophy, faculty, hugh, mellor, continued, to, find, the, award, undeserved, explaining, he, is, a, mediocre, unoriginal, philosopher, he, is, not, even, interestingly, bad, derrida, suggested, in, an, interview, that, part, of, the, reason, for, the, attacks, on, his, work, was, that, it, questioned, and, modified, the, rules, of, the, dominant, discourse, it, tries, to, politicize, and, democratize, education, and, the, university, scene, to, answer, a, question, about, the, exceptional, violence, the, compulsive, ferocity, and, the, exaggeration, of, the, attacks, he, would, say, that, these, critics, organize, and, practice, in, his, case, a, sort, of, obsessive, personality, cult, that, philosophers, should, know, how, to, question, and, above, all, to, moderate, richard, wolin, has, argued, since, 1991, that, derrida, s, work, as, well, as, that, of, derrida, s, major, inspirations, e, g, bataille, blanchot, levinas, heidegger, nietzsche, leads, to, a, corrosive, nihilism, for, example, wolin, argues, that, the, deconstructive, gesture, of, overturning, and, reinscription, ends, up, by, threatening, to, efface, many, of, the, essential, differences, between, nazism, and, non, nazism, in, 1991, when, wolin, published, a, derrida, interview, on, heidegger, in, the, first, edition, of, the, heidegger, controversy, derrida, argued, that, the, interview, was, an, intentionally, malicious, mistranslation, which, was, demonstrably, execrable, and, weak, simplistic, and, compulsively, aggressive, as, french, law, requires, the, consent, of, an, author, to, translations, and, this, consent, was, not, given, derrida, insisted, that, the, interview, not, appear, in, any, subsequent, editions, or, reprints, columbia, university, press, subsequently, refused, to, offer, reprints, or, new, editions, later, editions, of, the, heidegger, controversy, by, mit, press, also, omitted, the, derrida, interview, the, matter, achieved, public, exposure, owing, to, a, friendly, review, of, wolin, s, book, by, the, heideggerian, scholar, thomas, sheehan, that, appeared, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, in, which, sheehan, characterised, derrida, s, protests, as, an, imposition, of, censorship, it, was, followed, by, an, exchange, of, letters, derrida, in, turn, responded, to, sheehan, and, wolin, in, the, work, of, intellectuals, and, the, press, the, bad, example, how, the, new, york, review, of, books, and, company, do, business, which, was, published, in, the, book, points, twenty, four, academics, belonging, to, different, schools, and, groups, often, in, disagreement, with, each, other, and, with, deconstruction, signed, a, letter, addressed, to, the, new, york, review, of, books, in, which, they, expressed, their, indignation, for, the, magazine, s, behaviour, as, well, as, that, of, sheenan, and, wolin, critical, obituaries, of, derrida, were, published, in, the, new, york, times, the, economist, and, the, independent, the, magazine, the, nation, responded, to, the, new, york, times, obituary, saying, that, even, though, american, papers, had, scorned, and, trivialized, derrida, before, the, tone, seemed, particularly, caustic, a, second, obituary, by, deconstruction, scholar, and, derrida, s, friend, mark, c, taylor, was, published, by, the, times, a, few, days, after, the, first, one, jackie, was, born, at, daybreak, on, 15, july, 1930, at, el, biar, in, the, hilly, suburbs, of, algiers, in, a, holiday, home, the, boy, s, main, forename, was, probably, chosen, because, of, jackie, coogan, when, he, was, circumcised, he, was, given, a, second, forename, elie, which, was, not, entered, on, his, birth, certificate, unlike, the, equivalent,

in, your, intervention, if, i, missed, something, essential, please, forgive, me, first, i, would, protest, against, the, word, postmodernity, i, never, used, this, word, i, m, not, responsible, for, the, use, of, this, word, here, or, anywhere, else, a, decision, that, did, not, go, through, the, ordeal, of, the, undecidable, would, not, be, a, free, decision, it, would, only, be, the, programmable, application, or, unfolding, of, a, calculable, process, deconstructs, from, the, inside, every, assurance, of, presence, and, thus, every, criteriology, that, would, assure, us, of, the,

76, the, name, of, the, prophet, lie, elijah, in, english, so, i, took, myself, toward, the, hidden, name, without, its, ever, being, written, on, the, official, records, the, same, name, as, that, of, the, paternal, uncle, eug, ne, eliahou, derrida, contrary, to, what, some, people, believe, or, have, an, interest, in, making, believe, i, consider, myself, very, much, a, historian, very, historicist, deconstruction, calls, for, a, highly, historian, s, attitude, of, grammatology, for, example, is, a, history, book, through, and, through, i, take, great, interest, in, questions, of, language, and, rhetoric, and, i, think, they, deserve, enormous, consideration, but, there, is, a, point, where, the, authority, of, final, jurisdiction, is, neither, rhetorical, nor, linguistic, nor, even, discursive, the, notion, of, trace, or, of, text, is, introduced, to, mark, the, limits, of, the, linguistic, turn, this, is, one, more, reason, why, i, prefer, to, speak, of, mark, rather, than, of, language, in, the, first, place, the, mark, is, not, anthropological, it, is, prelinguistic, it, is, the, possibility, of, language, and, it, is, everywhere, there, is, a, relation, to, another, thing, or, relation, to, another, for, such, relations, the, mark, has, no, need, of, language, in, language, there, are, only, differences, even, more, important, a, difference, generally, implies, positive, terms, between, which, the, difference, is, set, up, but, in, language, there, are, only, differences, without, positive, terms, whether, we, take, the, signified, or, the, signifier, language, has, neither, ideas, nor, sounds, that, existed, before, the, linguistic, system, but, only, conceptual, and, phonic, differences, that, have, issued, from, the, system, the, idea, or, phonic, substance, that, a, sign, contains, is, of, less, importance, than, the, other, signs, that, surround, it, a, linguistic, system, is, a, series, of, differences, of, sound, combined, with, a, series, of, differences, of, ideas, but, the, pairing, of, a, certain, number, of, acoustical, signs, with, as, many, cuts, made, from, the, mass, thought, engenders, a, system, of, values, the, entire, history, of, the, concept, of, structure, before, the, rupture, of, which, we, are, speaking, must, be, thought, of, as, a, series, of, substitutions, of, centre, for, centre, as, a, linked, chain, of, determinations, of, the, centre, successively, and, in, a, regulated, fashion, the, centre, receives, different, forms, or, names, the, history, of, metaphysics, like, the, history, of, the, west, is, the, history, of, these, metaphors, and, metonymies, its, matrix, is, the, determination, of, being, as, presence, in, all, senses, of, this, word, it, could, be, shown, that, all, the, names, related, to, fundamentals, to, principles, or, to, the, centre, have, always, designated, an, invariable, presence, eidos, arch, telos, energeia, ousia, essence, existence, substance, subject, al, theia, transcendentality, consciousness, god, man, and, so, forth, all, these, formulations, have, been, possible, thanks, to, the, initial, distinction, between, different, irreducible, types, of, genesis, and, structure, worldly, genesis, and, transcendental, genesis, empirical, structure, eidetic, structure, and, transcendental, structure, to, ask, oneself, the, following, historico, semantic, question, what, does, the, notion, of, genesis, in, general, on, whose, basis, the, husserlian, diffraction, could, come, forth, and, be, understood, mean, and, what, has, it, always, meant, what, does, the, notion, of, structure, in, general, on, whose, basis, husserl, operates, and, operates, distinctions, between, empirical, eidetic, and, transcendental, dimensions, mean, and, what, has, it, always, meant, throughout, its, displacements, and, what, is, the, historico, semantic, relationship, between, genesis, and, structure, in, general, is, not, only, simply, to, ask, a, prior, linguistic, question, it, is, to, ask, the, question, about, the, unity, of, the, historical, ground, on, whose, basis, a, transcendental, reduction, is, possible, and, is, motivated, by, itself, it, is, to, ask, the, question, about, the, unity, of, the, world, from, which, transcendental, freedom, releases, itself, in, order, to, make, the, origin, of, this, unity, appear, perhaps, something, has, occurred, in, the, history, of, the, concept, of, structure, that, could, be, called, an, event, if, this, loaded, word, did, not, entail, a, meaning, which, it, is, precisely, the, function, of, structural, or, structuralist, thought, to, reduce, or, to, suspect, between, these, two, papers, is, staked, derrida, s, philosophical, ground, if, not, indeed, his, step, beyond, or, outside, philosophy, if, the, alterity, of, the, other, is, posed, that, is, only, posed, does, it, not, amount, to, the, same, for, example, in, the, form, of, the, constituted, object, or, of, the, informed, product, invested, with, meaning, etc, from, this, point, of, view, i, would, even, say, that, the, alterity, of, the, other, inscribes, in, this, relationship, that, which, in, no, case, can, be, posed, inscription, as, i, would, define, it, in, this, respect, is, not, a, simple, position, it, is, rather, that, by, means, of, which, every, position, is, of, itself, confounded, diff, rance, inscription, mark, text, and, not, only, thesis, or, theme, inscription, of, the, thesis, it, is, an, opening, that, is, structural, or, the, structurality, of, an, opening, yet, each, of, these, concepts, excludes, the, other, it, is, thus, as, little, a, structure, as, it, is, an, opening, it, is, as, little, static, as, it, is, genetic, as, little, structural, as, it, is, historical, it, can, be, understood, neither, from, a, genetic, nor, from, a, structuralist, and, taxonomic, point, of, view, nor, from, a, combination, of, both, points, of, view, and, note, that, this, complexity, of, the, origin, is, thus, not, only, spatial, but, temporal, which, is, why, diff, rance, is, a, matter, not, only, of, difference, but, of, delay, or, deferral, one, way, in, which, this, question, is, raised, in, relation, to, husserl, is, thus, the, question, of, the, possibility, of, a, phenomenology, of, history, which, derrida, raises, in, edmund, husserl, s, origin, of, geometry, an, introduction, 1962, one, of, the, more, persistent, misunderstandings, that, have, thus, far, forestalled, a, productive, debate, with, derrida, s, philosophical, thought, is, the, assumption, shared, by, many, philosophers, as, well, as, literary, critics, that, within, that, thought, just, anything, is, possible, derrida, s, philosophy, is, more, often, than, not, construed, as, a, license, for, arbitrary, free, play, in, flagrant, disregard, of, all, established, rules, of, argumentation, traditional, requirements, of, thought, and, ethical, standards, binding, upon, the, interpretative, community, undoubtedly, some, of, the, works, of, derrida, may, not, have, been, entirely, innocent, in, this, respect, and, may, have, contributed, however, obliquely, to, fostering, to, some, extent, that, very, misconception, but, deconstruction, which, for, many, has, come, to, designate, the, content, and, style, of, derrida, s, thinking, reveals, to, even, a, superficial, examination, a, well, ordered, procedure, a, step, by, step, type, of, argumentation, based, on, an, acute, awareness, of, level, distinctions, a, marked, thoroughness, and, regularity, deconstruction, must, be, understood, we, contend, as, the, attempt, to, account, in, a, certain, manner, for, a, heterogeneous, variety, or, manifold, of, nonlogical, contradictions, and, discursive, equalities, of, all, sorts, that, continues, to, haunt, and, fissure, even, the, successful, development, of, philosophical, arguments, and, their, systematic, exposition, is, perhaps, the, essay, which, i, like, most, doubtless, i, could, have, bound, it, as, a, long, note, to, one, or, the, other, of, the, other, two, works, of, grammatology, refers, to, it, and, economizes, its, development, but, in, a, classical, philosophical, architecture, speech, would, come, first, in, it, is, posed, at, a, point, which, appears, juridically, decisive, for, reasons, that, i, cannot, explain, here, the, question, of, the, privilege, of, the, voice, and, of, phonetic, writing, in, their, relationship, to, the, entire, history, of, the, west, such, as, this, history, can, be, represented, by, the, history, of, metaphysics, and, metaphysics, in, its, most, modern, critical, and, vigilant, form, husserl, s, transcendental, phenomenology, chose, to, address, the, american,

in, 12, and, 13, year, olds, a, capacity, for, discernment, that, it, can, judge, and, punish, said, a, second, petition, signed, by, sartre, and, de, beauvoir, along, with, fellow, intellectuals, michel, foucault, roland, barthes, jacques, derrida, a, leading, child, psychologist, fran, oise, dolto, and, writers, philippe, sollers, alain, robbe, grillet, and, louis, aragon, but, it, rejects, such, a, capacity, when, the, child, s, emotional, and, sexual, life, is, concerned, it, should, acknowledge, the, right, of, children, and, adolescents, to, have, relations, with, whomever, they, choose, if, it, were, only, a, question, of, my, work, of, the, particular, or, isolated, research, of, one, individual, this, wouldn, t, happen, indeed, the, violence, of, these, denunciations, derives, from, the, fact, that, the, work, accused, is, part, of, a, whole, ongoing, process, what, is, unfolding, here, like, the, resistance, it, necessarily, arouses, can, t, be, limited, to, a, personal, oeuvre, nor, to, a, discipline, nor, even, to, the, academic, institution, nor, in, particular, to, a, generation, it, s, often, the, active, involvement, of, students, and, younger, teachers, which, makes, certain, of, our, colleagues, nervous, to, the, point, that, they, lose, their, sense, of, moderation, and, of, the, academic, rules, they, invoke, when, they, attack, me, and, my, work, if, this, work, seems, so, threatening, to, them, this, is, because, it, isn, t, simply, eccentric, or, strange, incomprehensible, or, exotic, which, would, allow, them, to, dispose, of, it,

them, what, this, kind, of, questioning, does, is, modify, the, rules, of, the, dominant, discourse, it, tries, to, politicize, and, democratize, the, university, scene, in, short, to, answer, your, question, about, the, exceptional, violence, the, compulsive, ferocity, and, the, exaggeration, of, the, attacks, i, would, say, that, these, critics, organize, and, practice, in, my, case, a, sort,
