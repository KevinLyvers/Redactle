proposed, his, project, to, charles, i, the, young, king, of, spain, later, emperor, charles, v, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, became, one, of, his, subjects, and, navigators, under, the, terms, of, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, portugal, was, to, control, the, eastern, routes, to, asia, that, went, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, africa, magellan, instead, proposed, to, seek, a, southwestern, passage, around, south, america, to, reach, the, spice, islands, by, a, western, route, a, feat, never, before, accomplished, bergreen, further, states, that, magellan, claimed, to, charles, that, his, malaccan, or, sumatran, slave, enrique, had, been, a, native, of, the, spice, islands, and, used, enrique, and, letters, from, serr, o, to, prove, that, the, islands, were, so, far, east, that, they, would, fall, within, the, spanish, sphere, of, influence, if, the, world, were, truly, to, be, divided, in, half, the, details, of, the, eastern, division, implicit, in, the, tordesillas, treaty, would, later, be, formalized, in, the, 1529, treaty, of, zaragoza, king, manuel, saw, all, of, this, as, an, insult, and, did, everything, in, his, power, to, disrupt, magellan, s, arrangements, for, the, voyage, the, portuguese, king, allegedly, ordered, that, magellan, s, properties, be, vandalized, as, it, was, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, magellan, displayed, at, the, family, house, s, fa, ade, in, sabrosa, his, home, town, and, may, have, even, requested, the, assassination, of, the, navigator, when, magellan, eventually, sailed, to, the, open, seas, in, august, 1519, a, portuguese, fleet, was, sent, after, him, though, it, failed, to, capture, him, magellan, s, fleet, consisted, of, five, ships, carrying, supplies, for, two, years, of, travel, the, crew, consisted, of, about, 270, men, of, different, origins, though, the, numbers, may, vary, downwards, among, scholars, based, on, contradicting, data, from, the, many, documents, available, about, 60, percent, of, the, crew, were, spaniards, from, virtually, all, regions, of, castile, portuguese, and, italian, followed, with, 28, and, 27, seamen, respectively, while, mariners, from, france, 15, greece, 8, flanders, 5, germany, 3, ireland, 2, england, and, malaysia, one, each, and, other, people, of, unidentified, origin, completed, the, crew, the, fleet, left, spain, on, 20, september, 1519, sailing, west, across, the, atlantic, toward, south, america, in, late, november, they, made, landfall, at, cabo, de, santo, agostinho, near, present, day, recife, the, tupi, natives, having, already, engaged, with, portuguese, and, french, loggers, were, familiar, with, europeans, and, the, encounter, was, cordial, in, december, they, arrived, at, guanabara, bay, the, location, of, present, day, rio, de, janeiro, magellan, and, the, crew, stayed, onshore, for, two, weeks, replenishing, their, provisions, and, peacefully, interacting, with, the, locals, despite, the, pleasantries, the, first, fatal, casualty, of, the, expedition, occurred, two, months, earlier, during, the, atlantic, crossing, a, member, of, the, crew, antonio, salomon, was, caught, raping, a, cabin, boy, tried, and, found, guilty, he, was, garroted, two, months, later, on, the, shore, of, guanabara, bay, from, there, they, sailed, south, along, the, coast, searching, for, a, way, through, or, around, the, continent, after, three, months, of, searching, including, a, false, start, in, the, estuary, of, r, o, de, la, plata, weather, conditions, forced, the, fleet, to, stop, their, search, to, wait, out, the, winter, they, found, a, sheltered, natural, harbor, at, the, port, of, saint, julian, and, remained, there, for, five, months, shortly, after, landing, at, st, julian, there, was, a, mutiny, attempt, led, by, the, spanish, captains, juan, de, cartagena, gaspar, de, quesada, and, luis, de, mendoza, magellan, barely, managed, to, quell, the, mutiny, despite, at, one, point, losing, control, of, three, of, his, five, ships, to, the, mutineers, mendoza, was, killed, during, the, conflict, and, magellan, sentenced, quesada, and, cartagena, to, being, beheaded, and, marooned, respectively, lower, level, conspirators, were, made, to, do, hard, labor, in, chains, over, the, winter, but, were, later, freed, during, the, winter, one, of, the, fleet, s, ships, the, santiago, was, lost, in, a, storm, while, surveying, nearby, waters, though, no, men, were, killed, following, the, winter, the, fleet, resumed, their, search, for, a, passage, to, the, pacific, in, october, 1520, three, days, later, they, found, a, bay, which, eventually, led, them, to, a, strait, now, known, as, the, strait, of, magellan, which, allowed, them, passage, through, to, the, pacific, while, exploring, the, strait, one, of, the, remaining, four, ships, the, san, antonio, deserted, the, fleet, returning, east, to, spain, the, fleet, reached, the, pacific, by, the, end, of, november, 1520, based, on, the, incomplete, understanding, of, world, geography, at, the, time, magellan, expected, a, short, journey, to, asia, perhaps, taking, as, little, as, three, or, four, days, in, fact, the, pacific, crossing, took, three, months, and, twenty, days, the, long, journey, exhausted, their, supply, of, food, and, water, and, around, 30, men, died, mostly, of, scurvy, magellan, himself, remained, healthy, perhaps, because, of, his, personal, supply, of, preserved, quince, on, 6, march, 1521, the, exhausted, fleet, made, landfall, at, the, island, of, guam, and, were, met, by, native, chamorro, people, who, came, aboard, the, ships, and, took, items, such, as, rigging, knives, and, a, ship, s, boat, the, chamorro, people, may, have, thought, they, were, participating, in, a, trade, exchange, as, they, had, already, given, the, fleet, some, supplies, but, the, crew, interpreted, their, actions, as, theft, magellan, sent, a, raiding, party, ashore, to, retaliate, killing, several, chamorro, men, burning, their, houses, and, recovering, the, stolen, goods, on, 16, march, the, fleet, sighted, the, island, of, samar, zamal, in, the, eastern, philippine, islands, they, weighed, anchor, in, the, small, then, uninhabited, island, of, homonhon, humunu, where, they, would, remain, for, a, week, while, their, sick, crew, members, recuperated, magellan, befriended, the, tattooed, locals, of, the, neighboring, island, of, suluan, zuluan, and, traded, goods, and, supplies, and, learned, of, the, names, of, neighboring, islands, and, local, customs, after, resting, and, resupplying, magellan, sailed, on, deeper, into, the, visayan, islands, on, 28, march, they, anchored, off, the, island, of, limasawa, mazaua, where, they, encountered, a, small, outrigger, boat, boloto, after, talking, with, the, crew, of, the, boat, via, enrique, of, malacca, magellan, s, slave, interpreter, who, was, originally, from, sumatra, they, were, met, by, the, two, large, balangay, warships, balanghai, of, rajah, kulambo, colambu, of, butuan, and, one, of, his, sons, they, went, ashore, to, limasawa, where, they, met, kulambo, s, brother, another, leader, rajah, siawi, siaui, of, surigao, calagan, the, rulers, were, on, a, hunting, expedition, on, limasawa, they, received, magellan, as, their, guest, and, told, him, of, their, customs, and, of, the, regions, they, controlled, in, northeastern, mindanao, the, tattooed, rulers, and, the, locals, also, wore, and, used, a, great, amount, of, golden, jewelry, and, golden, artifacts, which, piqued, magellan, s, interest, on, 31, march, magellan, s, crew, held, the, first, mass, in, the, philippines, planting, a, cross, on, the, island, s, highest, hill, before, leaving, magellan, asked, the, rulers, for, the, next, nearest, trading, ports, they, recommended, he, visit, the, rajahnate, of, cebu, zubu, because, it, was, the, largest, they, set, off, for, cebu, accompanied, by, the, balangays, of, rajah, kulambo, and, reached, its, port, on, 7, april, 141, 150, magellan, met, with, the, king, of, cebu, rajah, humabon, who, asked, them, for, tribute, as, a, trade, thinking, they, were, traders, bartering, with, them, magellan, and, his, men, insisted, that, they, did, not, need, to, pay, tribute, as, they, were, sent, by, the, king, of, spain, the, most, powerful, king, in, the, world, and, that, they, were, willing, to, give, peace, to, them, if, they, wanted, peace, and, war, if, they, wanted, war, humabon, then, decided, not, to, ask, for, any, more, tribute, and, welcomed, them, instead, to, the, kingdom, of, cebu, sugbo, to, mark, the, arrival, of, christianity, in, the, far, east, magellan, then, planted, a, cross, on, the, shorelines, of, the, kingdom, magellan, set, about, converting, the, locals, including, the, king, and, his, wife, queen, humamay, to, christianity, rajah, humabon, was, renamed, carlos, and, queen, humamay, was, renamed, juana, after, the, king, and, queen, of, spain, after, her, baptism, the, queen, asked, the, spaniards, for, the, image, of, the, child, jesus, santo, ni, o, which, she, was, drawn, to, and, begged, them, for, the, image, in, contrition, amidst, her, tears, magellan, then, gave, the, image, of, the, child, jesus, along, with, an, image, of, the, virgin, mary, and, a, small, cross, to, the, queen, as, a, gesture, of, goodwill, for, accepting, the, new, faith, the, king, then, had, a, blood, compact, with, magellan, in, order, to, cement, the, allegiance, of, the, spaniards, and, the, cebuanos, the, king, then, told, the, spaniards, to, go, to, the, island, of, mactan, to, kill, his, enemy, lapulapu, the, spaniards, went, to, the, island, of, mactan, just, as, rajah, humabon, told, them, to, however, they, did, not, initially, come, by, force, and, wanted, to, christianize, them, unlike, the, people, of, cebu, who, accepted, the, new, religion, readily, the, king, of, mactan, datu, lapulapu, and, the, rest, of, the, island, of, mactan, resisted, on, 27, april, magellan, and, members, of, his, crew, attempted, to, subdue, the, mactan, natives, by, force, but, in, the, ensuing, battle, the, europeans, were, overpowered, and, magellan, was, killed, by, lapulapu, and, his, men, following, his, death, magellan, was, initially, succeeded, by, co, commanders, juan, serrano, and, duarte, barbosa, with, a, series, of, other, officers, later, leading, the, fleet, left, the, philippines, following, a, bloody, betrayal, by, former, ally, rajah, humabon, who, had, poisoned, many, spanish, soldiers, on, a, banquet, ruse, on, the, night, after, the, battle, for, being, easily, defeated, by, lapulapu, and, the, people, of, mactan, and, failing, to, kill, lapulapu, and, eventually, made, their, way, to, the, moluccas, in, november, 1521, laden, with, spices, they, attempted, to, set, sail, for, spain, in, december, but, found, that, only, one, of, their, remaining, two, ships, the, victoria, was, seaworthy, the, victoria, captained, by, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, finally, returned, to, spain, by, 6, september, 1522, completing, the, circumnavigation, of, the, 270, men, who, left, with, the, expedition, only, 18, or, 19, survivors, returned, after, several, weeks, in, the, philippines, magellan, had, converted, as, many, as, 2, 200, locals, to, christianity, including, rajah, humabon, of, cebu, and, most, leaders, of, the, islands, around, cebu, however, lapulapu, the, leader, of, mactan, resisted, conversion, in, order, to, gain, the, trust, of, rajah, humabon, magellan, sailed, to, mactan, with, a, small, force, on, the, morning, of, 27, april, 1521, during, the, resulting, battle, against, lapulapu, s, troops, magellan, was, struck, by, a, bamboo, spear, bangkaw, which, are, actually, metal, tipped, fire, hardened, rattan, and, later, surrounded, and, finished, off, with, other, weapons, antonio, pigafetta, and, gin, s, de, mafra, provided, written, documents, of, the, events, culminating, in, magellan, s, death, when, morning, came, forty, nine, of, us, leaped, into, the, water, up, to, our, thighs, and, walked, through, water, for, more, than, two, crossbow, flights, before, we, could, reach, the, shore, the, boats, could, not, approach, nearer, because, of, certain, rocks, in, the, water, the, other, eleven, men, remained, behind, to, guard, the, boats, when, we, reached, land, those, men, had, formed, in, three, divisions, to, the, number, of, more, than, one, thousand, five, hundred, persons, when, they, saw, us, they, charged, down, upon, us, with, exceeding, loud, cries, the, musketeers, and, crossbowmen, shot, from, a, distance, for, about, a, half, hour, but, uselessly, for, the, shots, only, passed, through, the, shields, recognizing, the, captain, so, many, turned, upon, him, that, they, knocked, his, helmet, off, his, head, twice, an, indian, hurled, a, bamboo, spear, into, the, captain, s, face, but, the, latter, immediately, killed, him, with, his, lance, which, he, left, in, the, indian, s, body, then, trying, to, lay, hand, on, sword, he, could, draw, it, out, but, halfway, because, he, had, been, wounded, in, the, arm, with, a, bamboo, spear, when, the, natives, saw, that, they, all, hurled, themselves, upon, him, one, of, them, wounded, him, on, the, left, leg, with, a, large, cutlass, which, resembles, a, scimitar, only, being, larger, that, caused, the, captain, to, fall, face, downward, when, immediately, they, rushed, upon, him, with, iron, and, bamboo, spears, and, with, their, cutlasses, until, they, killed, our, mirror, our, light, our, comfort, and, our, true, guide, nothing, of, magellan, s, body, survived, that, afternoon, the, grieving, rajah, king, hoping, to, recover, his, remains, offered, mactan, s, victorious, chief, a, handsome, ransom, of, copper, and, iron, for, them, but, datu, lapulapu, refused, he, intended, to, keep, the, body, as, a, war, trophy, since, his, wife, and, child, died, in, seville, before, any, member, of, the, expedition, could, return, to, spain, it, seemed, that, every, evidence, of, ferdinand, magellan, s, existence, had, vanished, from, the, earth, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, circumnavigation, few, celebrated, magellan, for, his, accomplishments, and, he, was, widely, discredited, and, reviled, in, spain, and, his, native, portugal, in, portugal, some, regarded, magellan, as, a, traitor, for, having, sailed, for, spain, in, spain, magellan, s, reputation, suffered, due, to, the, largely, unflattering, accounts, of, his, actions, given, by, the, survivors, of, the, expedition, the, first, news, of, the, expedition, came, from, the, crew, of, the, san, antonio, led, by, est, v, o, gomes, which, deserted, the, fleet, in, the, strait, of, magellan, and, returned, to, seville, 6, may, 1521, the, deserters, were, put, on, trial, but, eventually, exonerated, after, producing, a, distorted, version, of, the, mutiny, at, saint, julian, and, depicting, magellan, as, disloyal, to, the, king, the, expedition, was, assumed, to, have, perished, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, withheld, magellan, s, salary, from, his, wife, beatriz, considering, the, outcome, of, the, voyage, and, she, was, placed, under, house, arrest, with, their, young, son, on, the, orders, of, archbishop, fonseca, the, 18, survivors, who, eventually, returned, aboard, the, victoria, in, september, 1522, were, also, largely, unfavourable, to, magellan, many, including, the, captain, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, had, participated, in, the, mutiny, at, saint, julian, on, the, ship, s, return, charles, summoned, elcano, to, valladolid, inviting, him, to, bring, two, guests, he, brought, sailors, francisco, albo, and, hern, ndo, de, bustamante, pointedly, not, including, antonio, pigafetta, the, expedition, s, chronicler, under, questioning, by, valladolid, s, mayor, the, men, claimed, that, magellan, refused, to, follow, the, king, s, orders, and, gave, this, as, the, cause, for, the, mutiny, at, saint, julian, and, that, he, unfairly, favoured, his, relatives, among, the, crew, and, disfavoured, the, spanish, captains, one, of, the, few, survivors, loyal, to, magellan, was, antonio, pigafetta, though, not, invited, to, testify, with, elcano, pigafetta, made, his, own, way, to, valladolid, and, presented, charles, with, a, hand, written, copy, of, his, notes, from, the, journey, he, would, later, travel, through, europe, giving, copies, to, other, royals, including, john, iii, of, portugal, francis, i, of, france, and, philippe, villiers, de, l, isle, adam, after, returning, to, his, home, of, venice, pigafetta, published, his, diary, as, relazione, del, primo, viaggio, intorno, al, mondo, around, 1524, scholars, have, come, to, view, pigafetta, s, diary, as, the, most, thorough, and, reliable, account, of, the, circumnavigation, and, its, publication, helped, to, eventually, counter, the, misinformation, spread, by, elcano, and, the, other, surviving, mutineers, in, an, often, cited, passage, following, his, description, of, magellan, s, death, in, the, battle, of, mactan, pigafetta, eulogizes, the, captain, general, magellan, s, main, virtues, were, courage, and, perseverance, in, even, the, most, difficult, situations, for, example, he, bore, hunger, and, fatigue, better, than, all, the, rest, of, us, he, was, a, magnificent, practical, seaman, who, understood, navigation, better, than, all, his, pilots, the, best, proof, of, his, genius, is, that, he, circumnavigated, the, world, none,
