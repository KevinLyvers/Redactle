were, of, a, more, ancient, origin, aphorisms, concerning, his, teachings, were, compiled, in, the, analects, but, not, until, many, years, after, his, death, the, name, confucius, is, a, latinized, form, of, the, mandarin, chinese, k, ng, f, z, master, kong, and, was, coined, in, the, late, 16th, century, by, early, jesuit, missionaries, to, china, confucius, s, family, name, was, kong, oc, k,

in, zou, in, modern, shandong, the, area, was, notionally, controlled, by, the, kings, of, zhou, but, effectively, independent, under, the, local, lords, of, lu, who, ruled, from, the, nearby, city, of, qufu, his, father, kong, he, or, shuliang, he, was, an, elderly, commandant, of, the, local, lu, garrison, his, ancestry, traced, back, through, the, dukes, of, song, to, the, shang, dynasty, which, had, preceded, the, zhou, traditional, accounts, of, confucius, s, life, relate, that, kong, he, s, grandfather, had, migrated, the, family, from, song, to, lu, not, all, modern, scholars, accept, confucius, s, descent, from, song, nobility, 14, 15, kong, he, died, when, confucius, was, three, years, old, and, confucius, was, raised, by, his, mother, yan, zhengzai, in, poverty, his, mother, later, died, at, less, than, 40, years, of, age, at, age, 19, he, married, lady, qiguan, and, a, year, later, the, couple, had, their, first, child, their, son, kong, li, qiguan, and, confucius, later, had, two, daughters, together, one, of, whom, is, thought, to, have, died, as, a, child, and, one, was, named, kong, jiao, confucius, was, educated, at, schools, for, commoners, where, he, studied, and, learned, the, six, arts, confucius, was, born, into, the, class, of, shi, between, the, aristocracy, and, the, common, people, he, is, said, to, have, worked, in, various, government, jobs, during, his, early, 20s, and, as, a, bookkeeper, and, a, caretaker, of, sheep, and, horses, using, the, proceeds, to, give, his, mother, a, proper, burial, when, his, mother, died, confucius, aged, 23, is, said, to, have, mourned, for, three, years, as, was, the, tradition, in, confucius, s, time, the, state, of, lu, was, headed, by, a, ruling, ducal, house, under, the, duke, were, three, aristocratic, families, whose, heads, bore, the, title, of, viscount, and, held, hereditary, positions, in, the, lu, bureaucracy, the, ji, family, held, the, position, minister, over, the, masses, who, was, also, the, prime, minister, the, meng, family, held, the, position, minister, of, works, and, the, shu, family, held, the, position, minister, of, war, in, the, winter, of, 505, bce, yang, hu, a, retainer, of, the, ji, family, rose, up, in, rebellion, and, seized, power, from, the, ji, family, however, by, the, summer, of, 501, bce, the, three, hereditary, families, had, succeeded, in, expelling, yang, hu, from, lu, by, then, confucius, had, built, up, a, considerable, reputation, through, his, teachings, while, the, families, came, to, see, the, value, of, proper, conduct, and, righteousness, so, they, could, achieve, loyalty, to, a, legitimate, government, thus, that, year, 501, bce, confucius, came, to, be, appointed, to, the, minor, position, of, governor, of, a, town, eventually, he, rose, to, the, position, of, minister, of, crime, the, xunzi, says, that, once, assuming, the, post, confucius, ordered, the, execution, of, shaozheng, mao, another, lu, state, official, and, scholar, whose, lectures, attracted, the, three, thousand, disciples, several, times, except, yan, hui, shaozheng, mao, was, accused, of, five, crimes, each, worth, execution, including, concealed, evilness, stubborn, abnormality, eloquent, duplicity, erudition, in, bizarre, facts, and, generosity, to, evildoers, confucius, desired, to, return, the, authority, of, the, state, to, the, duke, by, dismantling, the, fortifications, of, the, city, strongholds, belonging, to, the, three, families, this, way, he, could, establish, a, centralized, government, however, confucius, relied, solely, on, diplomacy, as, he, had, no, military, authority, himself, in, 500, bce, hou, fan, the, governor, of, hou, revolted, against, his, lord, of, the, shu, family, although, the, meng, and, shu, families, unsuccessfully, besieged, hou, a, loyalist, official, rose, up, with, the, people, of, hou, and, forced, hou, fan, to, flee, to, the, state, of, qi, the, situation, may, have, been, in, favor, for, confucius, as, this, likely, made, it, possible, for, confucius, and, his, disciples, to, convince, the, aristocratic, families, to, dismantle, the, fortifications, of, their, cities, eventually, after, a, year, and, a, half, confucius, and, his, disciples, succeeded, in, convincing, the, shu, family, to, raze, the, walls, of, hou, the, ji, family, in, razing, the, walls, of, bi, and, the, meng, family, in, razing, the, walls, of, cheng, first, the, shu, family, led, an, army, towards, their, city, hou, and, tore, down, its, walls, in, 498, bce, soon, thereafter, gongshan, furao, a, retainer, of, the, ji, family, revolted, and, took, control, of, the, forces, at, bi, he, immediately, launched, an, attack, and, entered, the, capital, lu, earlier, gongshan, had, approached, confucius, to, join, him, which, confucius, considered, as, he, wanted, the, opportunity, to, put, his, principles, into, practice, but, he, gave, up, on, the, idea, in, the, end, confucius, disapproved, the, use, of, a, violent, revolution, by, principle, even, though, the, ji, family, dominated, the, lu, state, by, force, for, generations, and, had, exiled, the, previous, duke, creel, states, that, unlike, the, rebel, yang, hu, before, him, gongshan, may, have, sought, to, destroy, the, three, hereditary, families, and, restore, the, power, of, the, duke, however, dubs, is, of, the, view, that, gongshan, was, encouraged, by, viscount, ji, huan, to, invade, the, lu, capital, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, dismantling, the, bi, fortified, walls, whatever, the, situation, may, have, been, gongshan, was, considered, an, upright, man, who, continued, to, defend, the, state, of, lu, even, after, he, was, forced, to, flee, during, the, revolt, by, gongshan, zhong, you, had, managed, to, keep, the, duke, and, the, three, viscounts, together, at, the, court, zhong, you, was, one, of, the, disciples, of, confucius, and, confucius, had, arranged, for, him, to, be, given, the, position, of, governor, by, the, ji, family, when, confucius, heard, of, the, raid, he, requested, that, viscount, ji, huan, allow, the, duke, and, his, court, to, retreat, to, a, stronghold, on, his, palace, grounds, thereafter, the, heads, of, the, three, families, and, the, duke, retreated, to, the, ji, s, palace, complex, and, ascended, the, wuzi, terrace, confucius, ordered, two, officers, to, lead, an, assault, against, the, rebels, at, least, one, of, the, two, officers, was, a, retainer, of, the, ji, family, but, they, were, unable, to, refuse, the, orders, while, in, the, presence, of, the, duke, viscounts, and, court, the, rebels, were, pursued, and, defeated, at, gu, immediately, after, the, revolt, was, defeated, the, ji, family, razed, the, bi, city, walls, to, the, ground, the, attackers, retreated, after, realizing, that, they, would, have, to, become, rebels, against, the, state, and, their, lord, through, confucius, actions, the, bi, officials, had, inadvertently, revolted, against, their, own, lord, thus, forcing, viscount, ji, huan, s, hand, in, having, to, dismantle, the, walls, of, bi, as, it, could, have, harbored, such, rebels, or, confess, to, instigating, the, event, by, going, against, proper, conduct, and, righteousness, as, an, official, dubs, suggests, that, the, incident, brought, to, light, confucius, foresight, practical, political, ability, and, insight, into, human, character, when, it, was, time, to, dismantle, the, city, walls, of, the, meng, family, the, governor, was, reluctant, to, have, his, city, walls, torn, down, and, convinced, the, head, of, the, meng, family, not, to, do, so, the, zuo, zhuan, recalls, that, the, governor, advised, against, razing, the, walls, to, the, ground, as, he, said, that, it, made, cheng, vulnerable, to, qi, and, cause, the, destruction, of, the, meng, family, even, though, viscount, meng, yi, gave, his, word, not, to, interfere, with, an, attempt, he, went, back, on, his, earlier, promise, to, dismantle, the, walls, later, in, 498, bce, duke, ding, of, lu, personally, went, with, an, army, to, lay, siege, to, cheng, in, an, attempt, to, raze, its, walls, to, the, ground, but, he, did, not, succeed, thus, confucius, could, not, achieve, the, idealistic, reforms, that, he, wanted, including, restoration, of, the, legitimate, rule, of, the, duke, he, had, made, powerful, enemies, within, the, state, especially, with, viscount, ji, huan, due, to, his, successes, so, far, according, to, accounts, in, the, zuo, zhuan, and, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, confucius, departed, his, homeland, in, 497, bce, after, his, support, for, the, failed, attempt, of, dismantling, the, fortified, city, walls, of, the, powerful, ji, meng, and, shu, families, he, left, the, state, of, lu, without, resigning, remaining, in, self, exile, and, unable, to, return, as, long, as, viscount, ji, huan, was, alive, the, shiji, stated, that, the, neighboring, qi, state, was, worried, that, lu, was, becoming, too, powerful, while, confucius, was, involved, in, the, government, of, the, lu, state, according, to, this, account, qi, decided, to, sabotage, lu, s, reforms, by, sending, 100, good, horses, and, 80, beautiful, dancing, girls, to, the, duke, of, lu, the, duke, indulged, himself, in, pleasure, and, did, not, attend, to, official, duties, for, three, days, confucius, was, disappointed, and, resolved, to, leave, lu, and, seek, better, opportunities, yet, to, leave, at, once, would, expose, the, misbehavior, of, the, duke, and, therefore, bring, public, humiliation, to, the, ruler, confucius, was, serving, confucius, therefore, waited, for, the, duke, to, make, a, lesser, mistake, soon, after, the, duke, neglected, to, send, to, confucius, a, portion, of, the, sacrificial, meat, that, was, his, due, according, to, custom, and, confucius, seized, upon, this, pretext, to, leave, both, his, post, and, the, lu, state, after, confucius, s, resignation, he, travelled, around, the, principality, states, of, north, east, and, central, china, including, wey, song, zheng, cao, chu, qi, chen, and, cai, and, a, failed, attempt, to, go, to, jin, at, the, courts, of, these, states, he, expounded, his, political, beliefs, but, did, not, see, them, implemented, according, to, the, zuozhuan, confucius, returned, home, to, his, native, lu, when, he, was, 68, after, he, was, invited, to, do, so, by, ji, kangzi, the, chief, minister, of, lu, the, shiji, depicts, him, spending, his, last, years, teaching, 3000, pupils, with, 72, or, 77, accomplished, disciples, that, mastered, the, six, arts, meanwhile, confucius, dedicated, himself, in, transmitting, the, old, wisdom, by, writing, or, editing, the, five, classics, during, his, return, confucius, sometimes, acted, as, an, advisor, to, several, government, officials, in, lu, including, ji, kangzi, on, matters, including, governance, and, crime, burdened, by, the, loss, of, both, his, son, and, his, favorite, disciples, he, died, at, the, age, of, 71, or, 72, from, natural, causes, confucius, was, buried, on, the, bank, of, the, sishui, river, to, the, north, of, qufu, city, in, shandong, province, starting, as, a, humble, tomb, the, cemetery, of, confucius, had, been, expanded, by, emperors, since, the, han, dynasty, to, date, the, cemetery, of, confucius, covers, an, area, of, 183, hectares, with, more, than, 100, 000, graves, of, the, kong, descendants, it, is, included, in, the, world, heritage, list, for, its, cultural, and, architectural, value, in, the, analects, confucius, presents, himself, as, a, transmitter, who, invented, nothing, he, puts, the, greatest, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, study, and, it, is, the, chinese, character, for, study, that, opens, the, text, far, from, trying, to, build, a, systematic, or, formalist, theory, he, wanted, his, disciples, to, master, and, internalize, older, classics, so, that, they, can, capture, the, ancient, wisdoms, that, promotes, harmony, and, order, to, aid, their, self, cultivation, to, become, a, perfect, man, for, example, the, annals, would, allow, them, to, relate, the, moral, problems, of, the, present, to, past, political, events, the, book, of, odes, reflects, the, mood, and, concerns, of, the, commoners, and, their, view, on, government, while, the, book, of, changes, encompasses, the, key, theory, and, practice, of, divination, although, some, chinese, people, follow, confucianism, in, a, religious, manner, many, argue, that, its, values, are, secular, and, that, it, is, less, a, religion, than, a, secular, morality, proponents, of, religious, confucianism, argue, that, despite, the, secular, nature, of, confucianism, s, teachings, it, is, based, on, a, worldview, that, is, religious, confucius, was, considered, more, of, a, humanist, than, a, spiritualist, his, discussions, on, afterlife, and, views, concerning, heaven, remained, indeterminate, and, he, is, largely, unconcerned, with, spiritual, matters, often, considered, essential, to, religious, thought, such, as, the, nature, of, souls, one, of, the, deepest, teachings, of, confucius, may, have, been, the, superiority, of, personal, exemplification, over, explicit, rules, of, behavior, his, moral, teachings, emphasized, self, cultivation, emulation, of, moral, exemplars, and, the, attainment, of, skilled, judgment, rather, than, knowledge, of, rules, confucian, ethics, may, therefore, be, considered, a, type, of, virtue, ethics, his, teachings, rarely, rely, on, reasoned, argument, and, ethical, ideals, and, methods, are, conveyed, indirectly, through, allusion, innuendo, and, even, tautology, his, teachings, require, examination, and, context, to, be, understood, a, good, example, is, found, in, this, famous, anecdote, when, the, stables, were, burnt, down, on, returning, from, court, confucius, said, was, anyone, hurt, he, did, not, ask, about, the, horses, this, remark, was, considered, a, strong, manifestation, of, confucius, advocacy, in, humanism, one, of, his, teachings, was, a, variant, of, the, golden, rule, sometimes, called, the, silver, rule, owing, to, its, negative, form, zi, gong, asked, is, there, any, one, word, that, could, guide, a, person, throughout, life, the, master, replied, how, about, reciprocity, never, impose, on, others, what, you, would, not, choose, for, yourself, often, overlooked, in, confucian, ethics, are, the, virtues, to, the, self, sincerity, and, the, cultivation, of, knowledge, virtuous, action, towards, others, begins, with, virtuous, and, sincere, thought, which, begins, with, knowledge, a, virtuous, disposition, without, knowledge, is, susceptible, to, corruption, and, virtuous, action, without, sincerity, is, not, true, righteousness, cultivating, knowledge, and, sincerity, is, also, important, for, one, s, own, sake, the, superior, person, loves, learning, for, the, sake, of, learning, and, righteousness, for, the, sake, of, righteousness, the, confucian, theory, of, ethics, as, exemplified, in, l, is, based, on, three, important, conceptual, aspects, of, life, a, ceremonies, associated, with, sacrifice, to, ancestors, and, deities, of, various, types, b, social, and, political, institutions, and, c, the, etiquette, of, daily, behavior, some, believed, that, l, originated, from, the, heavens, but, confucius, stressed, the, development, of, l, through, the, actions, of, sage, leaders, in, human, history, his, discussions, of, l, seem, to, redefine, the, term, to, refer, to, all, actions, committed, by, a, person, to, build, the, ideal, society, rather, than, those, conforming, with, canonical, standards, of, ceremony, in, the, early, confucian, tradition, l, was, doing, the, proper, thing, at, the, proper, time, balancing, between, maintaining, existing, norms, to, perpetuate, an, ethical, social, fabric, and, violating, them, in, order, to, accomplish, ethical, good, training, in, the, l, of, past, sages, cultivates, virtues, in, people, that, include, ethical, judgment, about, when, l, must, be, adapted, in, light, of, situational, contexts, in, confucianism, the, concept, of, li, is, closely, related, to, y, which, is, based, upon, the, idea, of, reciprocity, y, can, be, translated, as, righteousness, though, it, may, mean, what, is, ethically, best, to, do, in, a, certain, context, the, term, contrasts, with, action, done, out, of, self, interest, while, pursuing, one, s, own, self, interest, is, not, necessarily, bad, one, would, be, a, better, more, righteous, person, if, one, s, life, was, based, upon, following, a, path, designed, to, enhance, the, greater, good, thus, an, outcome, of, y, is, doing, the, right, thing, for, the, right, reason, just, as, action, according, to, l, should, be, adapted, to, conform, to, the, aspiration, of, adhering, to, y, so, y, is, linked, to, the, core, value, of, r, n, r, n, consists, of, five, basic, virtues, seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and, kindness, r, n, is, the, virtue, of, perfectly, fulfilling, one, s, responsibilities, toward, others, most, often, translated, as, benevolence, humaneness, or, empathy, translator, arthur, waley, calls, it, goodness, with, a, capital, g, and, other, translations, that, have, been, put, forth, include, authoritativeness, and, selflessness, confucius, s, moral, system, was, based, upon, empathy, and, understanding, others, rather, than, divinely, ordained, rules, to, develop, one, s, spontaneous, responses, of, r, n, so, that, these, could, guide, action, intuitively, was, even, better, than, living, by, the, rules, of, y, confucius, asserts, that, virtue, is, a, mean, between, extremes, for, example, the, properly, generous, person, gives, the, right, amount, not, too, much, and, not, too, little, confucius, s, political, thought, is, based, upon, his, ethical, thought, he, argued, that, the, best, government, is, one, that, rules, through, rites, l, and, morality, and, not, by, using, incentives, and, coercion, he, explained, that, this, is, one, of, the, most, important, analects, if, the, people, be, led, by, laws, and, uniformity, sought, to, be, given, them, by, punishments, they, will, try, to, avoid, the, punishment, but, have, no, sense, of, shame, if, they, be, led, by, virtue, and, uniformity, sought, to, be, given, them, by, the, rules, of, propriety, they, will, have, the, sense, of, the, shame, and, moreover, will, become, good, analects, 2, 3, tr, legge, this, sense, of, shame, is, an, internalization, of, duty, confucianism, prioritizes, creating, a, harmonious, society, over, the, ruler, s, interests, opposes, material, incentives, and, harsh, punishments, and, downplays, the, role, of, institutions, in, guiding, behavior, as, in, legalism, emphasizing, moral, virtues, instead, confucius, looked, nostalgically, upon, earlier, days, and, urged, the, chinese, particularly, those, with, political, power, to, model, themselves, on, earlier, examples, in, times, of, division, chaos, and, endless, wars, between, feudal, states, he, wanted, to, restore, the, mandate, of, heaven, that, could, unify, the, world, all, under, heaven, and, bestow, peace, and, prosperity, on, the, people, because, his, vision, of, personal, and, social, perfections, was, framed, as, a, revival, of, the, ordered, society, of, earlier, times, confucius, is, often, considered, a, great, proponent, of, conservatism, but, a, closer, look, at, what, he, proposes, often, shows, that, he, used, and, perhaps, twisted, past, institutions, and, rites, to, push, a, new, political, agenda, of, his, own, a, revival, of, a, unified, royal, state, whose, rulers, would, succeed, to, power, on, the, basis, of, their, moral, merits, instead, of, lineage, these, would, be, rulers, devoted, to, their, people, striving, for, personal, and, social, perfection, and, such, a, ruler, would, spread, his, own, virtues, to, the, people, instead, of, imposing, proper, behavior, with, laws, and, rules, while, confucius, supported, the, idea, of, government, ruling, by, a, virtuous, king, his, ideas, contained, a, number, of, elements, to, limit, the, power, of, rulers, he, argued, for, representing, truth, in, language, and, honesty, was, of, paramount, importance, even, in, facial, expression, truth, must, always, be, represented, confucius, believed, that, if, a, ruler, is, to, lead, correctly, by, action, that, orders, would, be, unnecessary, in, that, others, will, follow, the, proper, actions, of, their, ruler, in, discussing, the, relationship, between, a, king, and, his, subject, or, a, father, and, his, son, he, underlined, the, need, to, give, due, respect, to, superiors, this, demanded, that, the, subordinates, must, advise, their, superiors, if, the, superiors, are, considered, to, be, taking, a, course, of, action, that, is, wrong, confucius, believed, in, ruling, by, example, if, you, lead, correctly, orders, by, force, or, punishment, are, not, necessary, confucius, heavily, promoted, the, use, of, music, with, rituals, or, the, rites, order, the, scholar, li, zehou, argued, that, confucianism, is, based, on, the, idea, of, rites, rites, serve, as, the, starting, point, for, each, individual, and, that, these, sacred, social, functions, allow, each, person, s, human, nature, to, be, harmonious, with, reality, given, this, confucius, believed, that, music, is, the, harmonization, of, heaven, and, earth, the, rites, is, the, order, of, heaven, and, earth, thus, the, application, of, music, in, rites, creates, the, order, that, makes, it, possible, for, society, to, prosper, the, confucian, approach, to, music, was, heavily, inspired, by, the, classic, of, poetry, and, the, classic, of, music, which, was, said, to, be, the, sixth, confucian, classic, until, it, was, lost, during, the, han, dynasty, the, classic, of, poetry, serves, as, one, of, the, current, confucian, classics, and, is, a, book, on, poetry, that, contains, a, diversified, variety, of, poems, as, well,
