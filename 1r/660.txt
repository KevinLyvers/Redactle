something, good, for, the, art, house, audience, but, i, also, applaud, the, commercial, heroism, of, a, director, who, can, steer, a, huge, production, and, keep, his, sanity, and, perspective, and, decent, human, feelings, beautifully, intact, 96, in, 1961, he, became, a, director, for, 20th, century, fox, and, also, cast, james, garner, in, the, children, s, hour, with, audrey, hepburn, and,

with, seven, hundred, performances, and, although, she, knew, the, part, well, wyler, still, had, to, mold, her, stage, role, for, the, screen, she, naturally, wanted, to, be, involved, in, the, film, s, production, often, asking, wyler, questions, but, they, got, along, well, things, were, ironed, out, when, she, discovered, some, of, us, knew, what, we, were, doing, kidded, wyler, what, originally, attracted, him, to, direct, streisand, was, similar, to, what, attracted, him, to, audrey, hepburn, who, had, also, been, new, to, film, audiences, he, met, with, streisand, during, her, musical, run, and, became, excited, at, the, prospect, of, guiding, another, new, star, into, an, award, winning, performance, he, sensed, and, admired, that, streisand, had, the, same, kind, of, dedication, to, being, an, actress, as, did, bette, davis, early, in, her, career, it, just, needed, to, be, controlled, and, toned, down, for, the, movie, camera, wyler, said, afterwards, i, m, terribly, fond, of, her, she, was, very, professional, very, good, a, hard, worker, too, hard, at, times, she, would, work, day, and, night, if, you, would, let, her, she, is, absolutely, tireless,

keep, all, objects, on, the, screen, whether, foreground, or, background, in, sharp, focus, at, the, same, time, the, technique, gives, the, illusion, of, depth, and, therefore, makes, the, scene, more, true, to, life, 77, a, perfectionist, wyler, earned, the, nickname, 40, take, wyler, on, the, set, of, jezebel, wyler, forced, henry, fonda, through, 40, takes, of, one, particular, scene, his, only, guidance, being, again, after, each, take, when, fonda, asked, for, more, direction, wyler, responded, it, stinks, similarly, when, charlton, heston, quizzed, the, director, about, the, supposed, shortcomings, of, his, performance, in, ben, hur, wyler, simply, told, heston, be, better, however, heston, notes, that, by, the, time, a, scene, is, done, regardless, of, how, hard, it, was, to, do, it, always, came, off, well, the, only, answer, i, have, is, that, his, taste, is, impeccable, and, every, actor, knows, it, your, faith, in, his, taste, and, what, it, will, do, for, your, performance, is, what, makes, casting, a, wyler, picture, a, cinch, doing, a, film, for, wyler, is, like, getting, the, works, in, a, turkish, bath, you, darn, near, drown, but, you, come, out, smelling, like, a, rose, 351, he, helped, propel, a, number, of, actors, to, stardom, including, finding, and, directing, audrey, hepburn, in, her, debut, starring, role, roman, holiday, 1953, and,
