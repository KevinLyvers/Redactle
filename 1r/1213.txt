legislation, s, passage, but, it, faced, strong, opposition, in, a, state, whose, economy, was, largely, agrarian, jefferson, took, seven, cases, of, freedom, seeking, enslaved, people, and, waived, his, fee, for, one, he, claimed, should, be, freed, before, the, minimum, statutory, age, for, emancipation, jefferson, invoked, natural, law, arguing, everyone, comes, into, the, world, with, a, right, to, his, own, person, and, using, it, at, his, own, will, this, is, what, is, called, personal, liberty, and, is, given, him, by, the, author, of, nature, because, it, is, necessary, for, his, own, sustenance, the, judge, cut, him, off, and, ruled, against, his, client, as, a, consolation, jefferson, gave, his, client, some, money, which, was, conceivably, used, to, aid, his, escape, shortly, thereafter, however, jefferson, s, underlying, intellectual, argument, that, all, people, were, entitled, by, their, creator, to, what, he, labeled, a, natural, right, to, liberty, is, one, he, would, later, incorporate, as, he, set, about, authoring, the, declaration, of, independence, he, also, took, on, 68, cases, for, the, general, court, of, virginia, in, 1767, in, addition, to,

second, continental, congress, beginning, in, 1775, at, the, outbreak, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, where, a, formal, declaration, of, independence, from, britain, was, overwhelmingly, favored, jefferson, was, inspired, by, the, enlightenment, ideals, of, the, sanctity, of, the, individual, and, the, writings, of, locke, and, montesquieu, jefferson, sought, out, john, adams, a, continental, congress, delegate, from, massachusetts, and, an, emerging, leader, in, the, congress, they, became, close, friends, and, adams, supported, jefferson, s, appointment, to, the, committee, of, five, charged, by, the, congress, with, authoring, a, declaration, of, independence, the, five, chosen, were, adams, jefferson, benjamin, franklin, robert, r, livingston, and, roger, sherman, the, committee, initially, thought, that, adams, should, write, the, document, but, adams, persuaded, the, committee, to, choose, jefferson, his, choice, was, due, to, jefferson, being, a, virginian, popular, and, being, considered, a, good, writer, by, adams, jefferson, consulted, with, his, fellow, committee, members, but, mostly, wrote, the, declaration, of, independence, in, isolation,

declaration, and, delegates, signed, it, on, august, 2, in, so, doing, the, delegates, were, knowingly, committing, an, act, of, high, treason, against, the, crown, which, was, deemed, the, most,

and, jefferson, began, a, sexual, relationship, in, paris, where, she, became, pregnant, the, son, indicated, hemings, agreed, to, return, to, the, united, states, only, after, jefferson, promised, to, free, her, children, when, they, came, of, age, while, in, france, jefferson, became, a, regular, companion, of, the, marquis, de, lafayette, a, french, hero, of, the, american, revolution, and, jefferson, used, his, influence, to, procure, trade, agreements, with, france, as, the, french, revolution, began, he, allowed, his, paris, residence, the, h, tel, de, langeac, to, be, used, for, meetings, by, lafayette, and, other, republicans, he, was, in, paris, during, the, storming, of, the, bastille, and, consulted, with, lafayette, while, the, latter, drafted, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, jefferson, often, found, his, mail, opened, by, postmasters, so, he, invented, his, own, enciphering, device, the, wheel, cipher, he, wrote, important, communications, in, code, for, the, rest, of, his, career, unable, to, attend, the, 1787, constitution, convention, jefferson, supported, the, constitution, but, desired, the, addition, of, the, promised, bill, of, rights, jefferson, left, paris, for, america, in, september, 1789, he, remained, a, firm, supporter, of, the, french, revolution, while, opposing, its, more, violent, elements, soon, after, returning, from, france, jefferson, accepted, president, washington, s, invitation, to, serve, as, secretary, of, state, pressing, issues, at, this, time, were, the, national, debt, and, the, permanent, location, of, the, capital, he, opposed, a, national, debt, preferring, that, each, state, retire, its, own, in, contrast, to, secretary, of, the, treasury, alexander, hamilton, who, desired, consolidation, of, states, debts, by, the, federal, government, hamilton, also, had, bold, plans, to, establish, the, national, credit, and, a, national, bank, but, jefferson, strenuously, opposed, this, and, attempted, to, undermine, his, agenda, which, nearly, led, washington, to, dismiss, him, from, the, cabinet, he, later, left, the, cabinet, voluntarily, the, second, major, issue, was, the, capital, s, permanent, location, hamilton, favored, a, capital, close, to, the, major, commercial, centers, of, the, northeast, while, washington, jefferson, and, other, agrarians, wanted, it, further, south, after, lengthy, deadlock, the, compromise, of, 1790, was, struck, permanently, locating, the, capital, on, the, potomac, river, and, the, federal, government, assumed, the, war, debts, of, all, original, 13, states, jefferson, s, goals, were, to, decrease, american, dependence, on, british, commerce, and, to, expand, commercial, trade, with, france, he, sought, to, weaken, spanish, colonialism, of, the, trans, appalachian, west, and, british, control, in, the, north, believing, this, would, aid, in, the, pacification, of, native, americans, jefferson, and, political, proteg, congressman, james, madison, founded, the, national, gazette, in, 1791, along, with, author, phillip, freneau, in, an, effort, to, counter, hamilton, s, federalist, policies, which, hamilton, was, promoting, through, the, influential, federalist, newspaper, the, gazette, of, the, united, states, the, national, gazette, made, particular, criticism, of, the, policies, promoted, by, hamilton, often, through, anonymous, essays, signed, by, the, pen, name, brutus, at, jefferson, s, urging, which, were, actually, written, by, madison, in, spring, 1791, jefferson, and, madison, took, a, vacation, to, vermont, jefferson, had, been, suffering, from, migraines, and, was, tiring, of, the, in, fighting, with, hamilton, in, may, 1792, jefferson, became, alarmed, at, the, political, rivalries, taking, shape, he, wrote, to, washington, imploring, him, to, run, for, reelection, that, year, as, a, unifying, influence, he, urged, the, president, to, rally, the, citizenry, to, a, party, that, would, defend, democracy, against, the, corrupting, influence, of, banks, and, monied, interests, as, espoused, by, the, federalists, historians, recognize, this, letter, as, the, earliest, delineation, of, democratic, republican, party, principles, jefferson, madison, and, other, democratic, republican, organizers, favored, states, rights, and, local, control, and, opposed, federal, concentration, of, power, whereas, hamilton, sought, more, power, for, the, federal, government, jefferson, supported, france, against, britain, when, the, two, nations, fought, in, 1793, though, his, arguments, in, the, cabinet, were, undercut, by, french, revolutionary, envoy, edmond, charles, gen, t, s, open, scorn, for, washington, in, his, discussions, with, british, minister, george, hammond, he, tried, in, vain, to, persuade, the, british, to, vacate, their, posts, in, the, northwest, and, to, compensate, the, u, s, for, enslaved, people, whom, the, british, had, freed, at, the, end, of, the, war, jefferson, sought, a, return, to, private, life, and, resigned, the, cabinet, position, in, december, 1793, he, may, also, have, wanted, to, bolster, his, political, influence, from, outside, the, administration, after, the, washington, administration, negotiated, the, jay, treaty, with, britain, in, 1794, jefferson, saw, a, cause, around, which, to, rally, his, party, and, organized, a, national, opposition, from, monticello, the, treaty, designed, by, hamilton, aimed, to, reduce, tensions, and, increase, trade, jefferson, warned, that, it, would, increase, british, influence, and, subvert, republicanism, calling, it, the, boldest, act, ever, ventured, on, to, undermine, the, government, the, treaty, passed, but, it, expired, in, 1805, during, jefferson, s, presidential, administration, and, was, not, renewed, jefferson, continued, his, pro, france, stance, during, the, violence, of, the, reign, of, terror, he, declined, to, disavow, the, revolution, to, back, away, from, france, would, be, to, undermine, the, cause, of, republicanism, in, america, in, the, presidential, campaign, of, 1796, jefferson, lost, the, electoral, college, vote, to, federalist, john, adams, 71, 68, and, was, thus, elected, vice, president, as, presiding, officer, of, the, senate, he, assumed, a, more, passive, role, than, his, predecessor, john, adams, he, allowed, the, senate, to, freely, conduct, debates, and, confined, his, participation, to, procedural, issues, which, he, called, an, honorable, and, easy, role, jefferson, had, previously, studied, parliamentary, law, and, procedure, for, 40, years, making, him, quite, qualified, to, serve, as, presiding, officer, in, 1800, he, published, his, assembled, notes, on, senate, procedure, as, a, manual, of, parliamentary, practice, he, cast, only, three, tie, breaking, votes, in, the, senate, in, four, confidential, talks, with, french, consul, joseph, l, tombe, in, the, spring, of, 1797, jefferson, attacked, adams, and, predicted, that, his, rival, would, serve, only, one, term, he, also, encouraged, france, to, invade, england, and, advised, l, tombe, to, stall, any, american, envoys, sent, to, paris, this, toughened, the, tone, that, the, french, government, adopted, toward, the, adams, administration, after, adams, s, initial, peace, envoys, were, rebuffed, jefferson, and, his, supporters, lobbied, for, the, release, of, papers, related, to, the, incident, called, the, xyz, affair, after, the, letters, used, to, disguise, the, identities, of, the, french, officials, involved, however, the, tactic, backfired, when, it, was, revealed, that, french, officials, had, demanded, bribes, rallying, public, support, against, france, the, u, s, began, an, undeclared, naval, war, with, france, known, as, the, quasi, war, during, the, adams, presidency, the, federalists, rebuilt, the, military, levied, new, taxes, and, enacted, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, jefferson, believed, these, laws, were, intended, to, suppress, democratic, republicans, rather, than, prosecute, enemy, aliens, and, considered, them, unconstitutional, to, rally, opposition, he, and, james, madison, anonymously, wrote, the, kentucky, and, virginia, resolutions, declaring, that, the, federal, government, had, no, right, to, exercise, powers, not, specifically, delegated, to, it, by, the, states, the, resolutions, followed, the, interposition, approach, of, madison, that, states, may, shield, their, citizens, from, federal, laws, that, they, deem, unconstitutional, jefferson, advocated, nullification, allowing, states, to, invalidate, federal, laws, altogether, he, warned, that, unless, arrested, at, the, threshold, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, would, drive, these, states, into, revolution, and, blood, historian, ron, chernow, claims, that, the, theoretical, damage, of, the, kentucky, and, virginia, resolutions, was, deep, and, lasting, and, was, a, recipe, for, disunion, contributing, to, the, american, civil, war, as, well, as, later, events, washington, was, so, appalled, by, the, resolutions, that, he, told, patrick, henry, that, if, systematically, and, pertinaciously, pursued, the, resolutions, would, dissolve, the, union, or, produce, coercion, jefferson, had, always, admired, washington, s, leadership, skills, but, felt, that, his, federalist, party, was, leading, the, country, in, the, wrong, direction, he, decided, not, to, attend, washington, s, funeral, in, 1799, because, of, acute, differences, with, him, while, serving, as, secretary, of, state, jefferson, contended, for, president, once, more, against, john, adams, in, 1800, adams, campaign, was, weakened, by, unpopular, taxes, and, vicious, federalist, infighting, over, his, actions, in, the, quasi, war, democratic, republicans, pointed, to, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, and, accused, the, federalists, of, being, secret, pro, britain, monarchists, while, federalists, charged, that, jefferson, was, a, godless, libertine, beholden, to, the, french, historian, joyce, appleby, said, the, election, was, one, of, the, most, acrimonious, in, the, annals, of, american, history, the, democratic, republicans, ultimately, won, more, electoral, college, votes, due, in, part, to, the, electors, that, resulted, from, the, addition, of, three, fifths, of, the, south, s, slaves, to, the, population, calculation, under, the, three, fifths, compromise, jefferson, and, his, vice, presidential, candidate, aaron, burr, unexpectedly, received, an, equal, total, because, of, the, tie, the, election, was, decided, by, the, federalist, dominated, house, of, representatives, hamilton, lobbied, federalist, representatives, on, jefferson, s, behalf, believing, him, a, lesser, political, evil, than, burr, on, february, 17, 1801, after, thirty, six, ballots, the, house, elected, jefferson, president, and, burr, vice, president, the, win, was, marked, by, democratic, republican, celebrations, throughout, the, country, some, of, jefferson, s, opponents, argued, that, he, owed, his, victory, to, the, south, s, inflated, number, of, electors, others, alleged, that, jefferson, secured, james, asheton, bayard, s, tie, breaking, electoral, vote, by, guaranteeing, the, retention, of, various, federalist, posts, in, the, government, jefferson, disputed, the, allegation, and, the, historical, record, is, inconclusive, the, transition, proceeded, smoothly, marking, a, watershed, in, american, history, as, historian, gordon, s, wood, writes, it, was, one, of, the, first, popular, elections, in, modern, history, that, resulted, in, the, peaceful, transfer, of, power, from, one, party, to, another, jefferson, was, sworn, in, as, president, by, chief, justice, john, marshall, at, the, new, capitol, in, washington, d, c, on, march, 4, 1801, his, inauguration, was, not, attended, by, outgoing, president, adams, in, contrast, to, his, two, predecessors, jefferson, exhibited, a, dislike, of, formal, etiquette, plainly, dressed, he, chose, to, walk, alongside, friends, to, the, capitol, from, his, nearby, boardinghouse, that, day, instead, of, arriving, by, carriage, his, inaugural, address, struck, a, note, of, reconciliation, and, commitment, to, democratic, ideology, declaring, we, have, been, called, by, different, names, brethren, of, the, same, principle, we, are, all, republicans, we, are, all, federalists, ideologically, he, stressed, equal, and, exact, justice, to, all, men, minority, rights, and, freedom, of, speech, religion, and, press, he, said, that, a, free, and, republican, government, was, the, strongest, government, on, earth, he, nominated, moderate, republicans, to, his, cabinet, james, madison, as, secretary, of, state, henry, dearborn, as, secretary, of, war, levi, lincoln, as, attorney, general, and, robert, smith, as, secretary, of, the, navy, widowed, since, 1782, jefferson, first, relied, on, his, two, daughters, to, serve, as, his, official, hostesses, in, late, may, 1801, he, asked, dolley, madison, wife, of, his, long, time, friend, james, madison, to, be, the, permanent, white, house, hostess, she, was, also, in, charge, of, the, completion, of, the, white, house, mansion, dolley, served, as, white, house, hostess, for, the, rest, of, jefferson, s, two, terms, and, then, for, another, eight, years, as, first, lady, while, her, husband, was, president, jefferson, s, first, challenge, as, president, was, shrinking, the, 83, million, national, debt, he, began, dismantling, hamilton, s, federalist, fiscal, system, with, help, from, the, secretary, of, the, treasury, albert, gallatin, gallatin, devised, a, plan, to, eliminate, the, national, debt, in, sixteen, years, by, extensive, annual, appropriations, and, reduction, in, taxes, the, administration, eliminated, the, whiskey, excise, and, other, taxes, after, closing, unnecessary, offices, and, cutting, useless, establishments, and, expenses, jefferson, believed, that, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, represented, a, most, deadly, hostility, to, republican, government, he, wanted, to, dismantle, the, bank, before, its, charter, expired, in, 1811, but, was, dissuaded, by, gallatin, gallatin, argued, that, the, national, bank, was, a, useful, financial, institution, and, set, out, to, expand, its, operations, jefferson, looked, to, other, corners, to, address, the, growing, national, debt, he, shrank, the, navy, for, example, deeming, it, unnecessary, in, peacetime, and, incorporated, a, fleet, of, inexpensive, gunboats, intended, only, for, local, defense, to, avoid, provocation, against, foreign, powers, after, two, terms, he, had, lowered, the, national, debt, from, 83, million, to, 57, million, jefferson, pardoned, several, of, those, imprisoned, under, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, congressional, republicans, repealed, the, judiciary, act, of, 1801, which, removed, nearly, all, of, adams, s, midnight, judges, a, subsequent, appointment, battle, led, to, the, supreme, court, s, landmark, decision, in, marbury, v, madison, asserting, judicial, review, over, executive, branch, actions, jefferson, appointed, three, supreme, court, justices, william, johnson, 1804, henry, brockholst, livingston, 1807, and, thomas, todd, 1807, jefferson, strongly, felt, the, need, for, a, national, military, university, producing, an, officer, engineering, corps, for, a, national, defense, based, on, the, advancement, of, the, sciences, rather, than, having, to, rely, on, foreign, sources, he, signed, the, military, peace, establishment, act, on, march, 16, 1802, founding, the, united, states, military, academy, at, west, point, the, act, documented, a, new, set, of, laws, and, limits, for, the, military, jefferson, was, also, hoping, to, bring, reform, to, the, executive, branch, replacing, federalists, and, active, opponents, throughout, the, officer, corps, to, promote, republican, values, jefferson, took, great, interest, in, the, library, of, congress, which, had, been, established, in, 1800, he, often, recommended, books, to, acquire, in, 1802, congress, authorized, jefferson, to, name, the, first, librarian, of, congress, and, formed, a, committee, to, establish, library, regulations, congress, also, granted, both, the, president, and, vice, president, the, right, to, use, the, library, american, merchant, ships, had, been, protected, from, barbary, coast, pirates, by, the, royal, navy, when, the, states, were, british, colonies, after, independence, however, pirates, often, captured, u, s, merchant, ships, pillaged, cargoes, and, enslaved, or, held, crew, members, for, ransom, jefferson, had, opposed, paying, tribute, to, the, barbary, states, since, 1785, in, 1801, he, authorized, a, u, s, navy, fleet, under, commodore, richard, dale, to, make, a, show, of, force, in, the, mediterranean, the, first, american, naval, squadron, to, cross, the, atlantic, following, the, fleet, s, first, engagement, he, successfully, asked, congress, for, a, declaration, of, war, the, first, barbary, war, was, the, first, foreign, war, fought, by, the, u, s, pasha, of, tripoli, yusuf, karamanli, captured, the, uss, philadelphia, so, jefferson, authorized, william, eaton, the, u, s, consul, to, tunis, to, lead, a, force, to, restore, the, pasha, s, older, brother, to, the, throne, the, american, navy, forced, tunis, and, algiers, into, breaking, their, alliance, with, tripoli, jefferson, ordered, five, separate, naval, bombardments, of, tripoli, leading, the, pasha, to, sign, a, treaty, that, restored, peace, in, the, mediterranean, this, victory, proved, only, temporary, but, according, to, wood, many, americans, celebrated, it, as, a, vindication, of, their, policy, of, spreading, free, trade, around, the, world, and, as, a, great, victory, for, liberty, over, tyranny, spain, ceded, ownership, of, the, louisiana, territory, in, 1800, to, france, jefferson, was, concerned, that, napoleon, s, interests, in, the, vast, territory, would, threaten, the, security, of, the, continent, and, mississippi, river, shipping, he, wrote, that, the, cession, works, most, sorely, on, the, u, s, it, completely, reverses, all, the, political, relations, of, the, u, s, in, 1802, he, instructed, james, monroe, and, robert, r, livingston, to, negotiate, the, purchase, of, new, orleans, and, adjacent, coastal, areas, in, early, 1803, jefferson, offered, napoleon, nearly, 10, million, for, 40, 000, square, miles, 100, 000, square, kilometres, of, tropical, territory, napoleon, realized, that, french, military, control, was, impractical, over, such, a, vast, remote, territory, and, he, was, in, dire, need, of, funds, for, his, wars, on, the, home, front, in, early, april, 1803, he, unexpectedly, made, negotiators, a, counter, offer, to, sell, 827, 987, square, miles, 2, 144, 480, square, kilometres, of, french, territory, for, 15, million, 371, million, in, 2023, doubling, the, size, of, the, united, states, u, s, negotiators, accepted, the, offer, and, signed, the, treaty, on, april, 30, 1803, word, of, the, unexpected, purchase, did, not, reach, jefferson, until, july, 3, 1803, he, unknowingly, acquired, the, most, fertile, tract, of, land, of, its, size, on, earth, making, the, new, country, self, sufficient, in, food, and, other, resources, the, sale, also, significantly, curtailed, european, presence, in, north, america, removing, obstacles, to, u, s, westward, expansion, most, thought, that, this, was, an, exceptional, opportunity, despite, republican, reservations, about, the, constitutional, authority, of, the, federal, government, to, acquire, land, jefferson, initially, thought, that, a, constitutional, amendment, was, necessary, to, purchase, and, govern, the, new, territory, but, he, later, changed, his, mind, fearing, that, this, would, give, cause, to, oppose, the, purchase, and, urged, a, speedy, debate, and, ratification, on, october, 20, 1803, the, senate, ratified, the, purchase, treaty, by, a, vote, of, 24, 7, jefferson, personally, was, humble, about, acquiring, the, louisiana, territory, but, he, resented, complainers, who, called, the, vast, domain, a, howling, wilderness, after, the, purchase, jefferson, preserved, the, region, s, spanish, legal, code, and, instituted, a, gradual, approach, to, integrating, settlers, into, american, democracy, he, believed, that, a, period, of, the, federal, rule, would, be, necessary, while, louisianans, adjusted, to, their, new, nation, historians, have, differed, in, their, assessments, regarding, the, constitutional, implications, of, the, sale, but, they, typically, hail, the, louisiana, acquisition, as, a, major, accomplishment, frederick, jackson, turner, called, the, purchase, the, most, formative, event, in, american, history, jefferson, anticipated, further, westward, settlements, due, to, the, louisiana, purchase, and, arranged, for, the, exploration, and, mapping, of, the, uncharted, territory, he, sought, to, establish, a, u, s, claim, ahead, of, competing, european, interests, and, to, find, the, rumored, northwest, passage, jefferson, and, others, were, influenced, by, exploration, accounts, of, le, page, du, pratz, in, louisiana, 1763, and, james, cook, in, the, pacific, 1784, and, they, persuaded, congress, in, 1804, to, fund, an, expedition, to, explore, and, map, the, newly, acquired, territory, to, the, pacific, ocean, jefferson, appointed, secretary, meriwether, lewis, and, acquaintance, william, clark, to, lead, the, corps, of, discovery, 1803, 1806, in, the, months, leading, up, to, the, expedition, jefferson, tutored, lewis, in, the, sciences, of, mapping, botany, natural, history, mineralogy, and, astronomy, and, navigation, giving, him, unlimited, access, to, his, library, at, monticello, which, included, the, largest, collection, of, books, in, the, world, on, the, subject, of, the, geography, and, natural, history, of, the, north, american, continent, along, with, an, impressive, collection, of, maps, the, expedition, lasted, from, may, 1804, to, september, 1806, and, obtained, a, wealth, of, scientific, and, geographic, knowledge, including, knowledge, of, many, indian, tribes, jefferson, organized, three, other, western, expeditions, the, william, dunbar, and, george, hunter, expedition, on, the, ouachita, river, 1804, 1805, the, thomas, freeman, and, peter, custis, expedition, 1806, on, the, red, river, and, the, zebulon, pike, expedition, 1806, 1807, into, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, southwest, all, three, produced, valuable, information, about, the, american, frontier, jefferson, refuted, the, contemporary, notion, that, indians, were, inferior, and, maintained, that, they, were, equal, in, body, and, mind, to, people, of, european, descent, although, he, believed, them, to, be, inferior, in, terms, of, culture, and, technology, as, governor, of, virginia, during, the, revolutionary, war, jefferson, recommended, moving, the, cherokee, and, shawnee, tribes, who, had, allied, with, the, british, to, west, of, the, mississippi, river, but, when, he, took, office, as, president, he, quickly, took, measures, to, avert, another, major, conflict, as, american, and, indian, societies, were, in, collision, and, the, british, were, inciting, indian, tribes, from, canada, in, georgia, he, stipulated, that, the, state, would, release, its, legal, claims, for, lands, to, its, west, in, exchange, for, military, support, in, expelling, the, cherokee, from, georgia, this, facilitated, his, policy, of, western, expansion, to, advance, compactly, as, we, multiply, in, keeping, with, his, enlightenment, thinking, president, jefferson, adopted, an, assimilation, policy, toward, american, indians, known, as, his, civilization, program, which, included, securing, peaceful, u, s, indian, treaty, alliances, and, encouraging, agriculture, jefferson, advocated, that, indian, tribes, should, make, federal, purchases, by, credit, holding, their, lands, as, collateral, various, tribes, accepted, jefferson, s, policies, including, the, shawnees, led, by, black, hoof, the, muscogee, and, the, cherokee, however, some, shawnees, led, by, tecumseh, broke, off, from, black, hoof, and, opposed, jefferson, s, assimilation, policies, historian, bernard, sheehan, argues, that, jefferson, believed, that, assimilation, was, best, for, american, indians, and, next, best, was, removal, to, the, west, he, felt, that, the, worst, outcome, of, the, conflict, would, be, their, attacking, the, whites, jefferson, told, u, s, secretary, of, war, henry, dearborn, who, then, oversaw, indian, affairs, if, we, are, constrained, to, lift, the, hatchet, against, any, tribe, we, will, never, lay, it, down, until, that, tribe, is, exterminated, or, driven, beyond, the, mississippi, miller, agrees, that, jefferson, believed, that, indians, should, assimilate, to, american, customs, and, agriculture, historians, such, as, peter, s, onuf, and, merrill, d, peterson, argue, that, jefferson, s, actual, indian, policies, did, little, to, promote, assimilation, and, were, a, pretext, to, seize, lands, jefferson, was, nominated, for, reelection, by, the, republican, party, with, george, clinton, replacing, burr, as, his, running, mate, the, federalist, party, ran, charles, cotesworth, pinckney, of, south, carolina, john, adams, s, vice, presidential, candidate, in, the, 1800, election, the, jefferson, clinton, ticket, won, overwhelmingly, in, the, electoral, college, vote, by, 162, to, 14, promoting, their, achievement, of, a, strong, economy, lower, taxes, and, the, louisiana, purchase, in, march, 1806, a, split, developed, in, the, republican, party, led, by, fellow, virginian, and, former, republican, ally, john, randolph, who, viciously, accused, president, jefferson, on, the, floor, of, the, house, of, moving, too, far, in, the, federalist, direction, in, so, doing, randolph, permanently, set, himself, apart, politically, from, jefferson, jefferson, and, madison, had, backed, resolutions, to, limit, or, ban, british, imports, in, retaliation, for, british, seizures, of, american, shipping, also, in, 1808, jefferson, was, the, first, president, to, propose, a, broad, federal, plan, to, build, roads, and, canals, across, several, states, asking, for, 20, million, further, alarming, randolph, and, believers, of, limited, government, jefferson, s, popularity, further, suffered, in, his, second, term, due, to, his, response, to, wars, in, europe, positive, relations, with, britain, had, diminished, due, partly, to, the, antipathy, between, jefferson, and, british, diplomat, anthony, merry, after, napoleon, s, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, in, 1805, napoleon, became, more, aggressive, in, his, negotiations, over, trading, rights, which, american, efforts, failed, to, counter, jefferson, then, led, the, enactment, of, the, embargo, act, of, 1807, directed, at, both, france, and, britain, this, triggered, economic, chaos, in, the, u, s, and, was, strongly, criticized, resulting, in, jefferson, having, to, abandon, the, policy, a, year, later, during, the, revolutionary, era, the, states, abolished, the, international, slave, trade, but, south, carolina, reopened, it, in, his, annual, message, of, december, 1806, jefferson, denounced, the, violations, of, human, rights, attending, the, international, slave, trade, calling, on, the, newly, elected, congress, to, criminalize, it, immediately, in, 1807, congress, passed, the, act, prohibiting, importation, of, slaves, which, jefferson, signed, the, act, established, severe, punishment, against, the, international, slave, trade, although, it, did, not, address, the, issue, domestically, in, haiti, jefferson, s, neutrality, had, allowed, arms, to, enable, the, slave, independence, movement, during, its, revolution, and, blocked, attempts, to, assist, napoleon, who, was, defeated, there, in, 1803, but, his, administration, refused, official, recognition, of, the, country, during, his, second, term, in, deference, to, southern, complaints, about, the, racial, violence, against, slave, holders, it, was, eventually, extended, to, haiti, in, 1862, following, the, 1801, electoral, deadlock, jefferson, s, relationship, with, his, vice, president, aaron, burr, rapidly, eroded, jefferson, suspected, burr, of, seeking, the, presidency, for, himself, while, burr, was, angered, by, jefferson, s, refusal, to, appoint, some, of, his, supporters, to, federal, office, burr, was, dropped, from, the, democratic, republican, ticket, in, 1804, in, favor, of, charismatic, george, clinton, the, same, year, burr, was, soundly, defeated, in, his, bid, to, be, elected, new, york, governor, during, the, campaign, alexander, hamilton, publicly, made, callous, remarks, regarding, burr, s, moral, character, burr, challenged, hamilton, to, a, duel, mortally, wounding, him, on, july, 11, 1804, burr, was, indicted, for, hamilton, s, murder, in, new, york, and, new, jersey, causing, him, to, flee, to, georgia, although, he, remained, president, of, the, senate, during, supreme, court, justice, samuel, chase, s, impeachment, trial, both, indictments, quietly, died, and, burr, was, not, prosecuted, also, during, the, election, certain, new, england, separatists, approached, burr, desiring, a, new, england, federation, and, intimating, that, he, would, be, their, leader, however, nothing, came, of, the, plot, since, burr, had, lost, the, election, and, his, reputation, was, ruined, after, killing, hamilton, in, august, 1804, burr, contacted, british, minister, anthony, merry, offering, to, cede, u, s, western, territory, in, return, for, money, and, british, ships, after, leaving, office, in, april, 1805, burr, traveled, west, and, conspired, with, louisiana, territory, governor, james, wilkinson, beginning, a, large, scale, recruitment, for, a, military, expedition, other, plotters, included, ohio, senator, john, smith, and, irishman, harman, blennerhassett, burr, discussed, seizing, control, of, mexico, or, spanish, florida, or, forming, a, secessionist, state, in, new, orleans, or, the, western, u, s, historians, remain, unclear, as, to, his, true, goal, in, the, fall, of, 1806, burr, launched, a, military, flotilla, carrying, about, 60, men, down, the, ohio, river, wilkinson, renounced, the, plot, and, reported, burr, s, expedition, to, jefferson, who, ordered, burr, s, arrest, on, february, 13, 1807, burr, was, captured, in, louisiana, and, sent, to, virginia, to, be, tried, for, treason, burr, s, 1807, conspiracy, trial, became, a, national, issue, jefferson, attempted, to, preemptively, influence, the, verdict, by, telling, congress, that, burr, s, guilt, was, beyond, question, but, the, case, came, before, his, longtime, political, foe, john, marshall, who, dismissed, the, treason, charge, burr, s, legal, team, subpoenaed, jefferson, but, jefferson, refused, to, testify, making, the, first, argument, for, executive, privilege, instead, jefferson, provided, relevant, legal, documents, after, a, three, month, trial, the, jury, found, burr, not, guilty, while, jefferson, denounced, his, acquittal, jefferson, subsequently, removed, wilkinson, as, territorial, governor, but, retained, him, in, the, u, s, military, historian, james, n, banner, criticized, jefferson, for, continuing, to, trust, wilkinson, a, faithless, plotter, commanding, general, james, wilkinson, was, a, holdover, of, the, washington, and, adams, administrations, in, 1804, wilkinson, received, 12, 000, pesos, from, the, spanish, for, information, on, american, boundary, plans, wilkinson, also, received, advances, on, his, salary, and, payments, on, claims, submitted, to, secretary, of, war, henry, dearborn, this, damaging, information, apparently, was, unknown, to, jefferson, in, 1805, jefferson, trusted, wilkinson, and, appointed, him, louisiana, territory, governor, admiring, wilkinson, s, work, ethic, in, january, 1806, jefferson, received, information, from, kentucky, u, s, attorney, joseph, davies, that, wilkinson, was, on, the, spanish, payroll, jefferson, took, no, action, against, wilkinson, since, there, was, not, then, significant, evidence, against, him, an, investigation, by, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, in, december, 1807, exonerated, wilkinson, in, 1808, a, military, court, looked, into, the, allegations, against, wilkinson, but, also, found, a, lack, of, evidence, jefferson, retained, wilkinson, in, the, u, s, army, evidence, found, in, spanish, archives, in, the, 20th, century, proved, wilkinson, was, on, the, spanish, payroll, in, the, aftermath, of, the, louisiana, purchase, jefferson, attempted, to, annex, west, florida, from, spain, in, his, annual, message, to, congress, on, december, 3, 1805, jefferson, railed, against, spain, over, florida, border, depredations, a, few, days, later, jefferson, secretly, requested, a, two, million, dollar, expenditure, to, purchase, florida, floor, leader, john, randolph, opposed, annexation, and, was, upset, over, jefferson, s, secrecy, on, the, matter, and, believed, the, money, would, land, in, the, coffers, of, napoleon, the, two, million, dollar, bill, passed, only, after, jefferson, successfully, maneuvered, to, replace, randolph, with, barnabas, bidwell, as, floor, leader, this, aroused, suspicion, of, jefferson, and, charges, of, undue, executive, influence, over, congress, jefferson, signed, the, bill, into, law, in, february, 1806, six, weeks, later, the, law, was, made, public, the, two, million, dollars, was, to, be, given, to, france, as, payment, in, turn, to, put, pressure, on, spain, to, permit, the, annexation, of, florida, by, the, united, states, france, however, refused, the, offer, and, florida, remained, under, spanish, control, the, failed, venture, damaged, jefferson, s, reputation, among, his, supporters, the, british, conducted, seizures, of, american, shipping, to, search, for, british, deserters, from, 1806, to, 1807, american, citizens, were, thus, impressed, into, the, british, naval, service, in, 1806, jefferson, issued, a, call, for, a, boycott, of, british, goods, on, april, 18, congress, passed, the, non, importation, acts, but, they, were, never, enforced, later, that, year, jefferson, asked, james, monroe, and, william, pinkney, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, harassment, of, american, shipping, though, britain, showed, no, signs, of, improving, relations, the, monroe, pinkney, treaty, was, finalized, but, lacked, any, provisions, to, end, the, british, policies, and, jefferson, refused, to, submit, it, to, the, senate, for, ratification, the, british, ship, hms, leopard, fired, upon, the, uss, chesapeake, off, the, virginia, coast, in, june, 1807, jefferson, issued, a, proclamation, banning, armed, british, ships, from, u, s, waters, he, presumed, unilateral, authority, to, call, on, the, states, to, prepare, 100, 000, militia, and, ordered, the, purchase, of, arms, ammunition, and, supplies, writing, the, laws, of, necessity, of, self, preservation, of, saving, our, country, when, in, danger, are, of, higher, obligation, the, uss, revenge, was, dispatched, to, demand, an, explanation, from, the, british, government, it, also, was, fired, upon, jefferson, called, for, a, special, session, of, congress, in, october, to, enact, an, embargo, or, alternatively, to, consider, war, in, december, 1807, news, arrived, that, napoleon, had, extended, the, berlin, decree, globally, banning, british, imports, in, britain, king, george, iii, ordered, redoubling, efforts, at, impressment, including, american, sailors, but, congress, had, no, appetite, to, prepare, the, u, s, for, war, jefferson, asked, for, and, received, the, embargo, act, an, alternative, that, allowed, the, u, s, more, time, to, build, up, defensive, works, militias, and, naval, forces, meacham, said, that, the, embargo, act, was, a, projection, of, power, that, surpassed, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, and, r, b, bernstein, said, that, jefferson, was, pursuing, policies, resembling, those, he, had, cited, in, 1776, as, grounds, for, independence, and, revolution, in, november, 1807, jefferson, for, several, days, met, with, his, cabinet, to, discuss, the, deteriorating, foreign, situation, secretary, of, state, james, madison, supported, the, embargo, while, treasury, secretary, gallatin, opposed, it, due, to, its, indefinite, time, frame, and, the, risk, to, the, policy, of, american, neutrality, the, u, s, economy, suffered, criticism, grew, and, opponents, began, evading, the, embargo, instead, of, retreating, jefferson, sent, federal, agents, to, secretly, track, down, smugglers, and, violators, three, acts, were, passed, in, congress, during, 1807, and, 1808, called, the, supplementary, the, additional, and, the, enforcement, acts, the, government, could, not, prevent, american, vessels, from, trading, with, the, european, belligerents, once, they, had, left, american, ports, although, the, embargo, triggered, a, devastating, decline, in, exports, in, december, 1807, jefferson, announced, his, intention, not, to, seek, a, third, term, he, turned, his, attention, increasingly, to, monticello, during, the, last, year, of, his, presidency, giving, madison, and, gallatin, almost, total, control, of, affairs, shortly, before, leaving, office, in, march, 1809, jefferson, signed, the, repeal, of, the, embargo, in, its, place, the, non, intercourse, act, was, passed, but, it, proved, no, more, effective, the, day, before, madison, was, inaugurated, as, his, successor, jefferson, said, that, he, felt, like, a, prisoner, released, from, his, chains, after, his, presidency, jefferson, remained, influential, and, continued, to, correspond, with, many, of, the, country, s, leaders, including, his, two, prot, g, es, madison, and, monroe, who, succeeded, him, as, president, the, monroe, doctrine, strongly, resembles, solicited, advice, that, jefferson, gave, to, monroe, in, 1823, jefferson, envisioned, a, university, free, of, church, influences, where, students, could, specialize, in, new, areas, not, offered, at, other, colleges, he, believed, that, education, engendered, a, stable, society, which, should, provide, publicly, funded, schools, accessible, based, solely, on, ability, he, initially, proposed, his, university, in, a, letter, to, joseph, priestley, in, 1800, and, in, 1819, founded, the, university, of, virginia, he, organized, the, state, legislative, campaign, for, its, charter, and, with, the, assistance, of, edmund, bacon, purchased, the, location, he, was, the, principal, designer, of, the, buildings, planned, the, university, s, curriculum, and, served, as, the, first, rector, upon, its, opening, in, 1825, jefferson, was, a, strong, disciple, of, greek, and, roman, architectural, styles, which, he, believed, to, be, most, representative, of, american, democracy, each, academic, unit, called, a, pavilion, was, designed, with, a, two, story, temple, front, while, the, library, rotunda, was, modeled, on, the, roman, pantheon, jefferson, referred, to, the, university, s, grounds, as, the, academical, village, and, he, reflected, his, educational, ideas, in, its, layout, the, ten, pavilions, included, classrooms, and, faculty, residences, they, formed, a, quadrangle, and, were, connected, by, colonnades, behind, which, stood, the, student, rooms, gardens, and, vegetable, plots, were, placed, behind, the, pavilions, and, were, surrounded, by, serpentine, walls, affirming, the, importance, of, the, agrarian, lifestyle, the, university, had, a, library, rather, than, a, church, at, its, center, emphasizing, its, secular, nature, controversial, at, the, time, when, jefferson, died, in, 1826, james, madison, replaced, him, as, rector, jefferson, bequeathed, most, of, his, reconstructed, library, of, almost, 2, 000, volumes, to, the, university, only, one, other, ex, president, has, founded, a, university, millard, fillmore, founded, the, university, at, buffalo, in, 1846, jefferson, and, john, adams, became, good, friends, in, the, first, decades, of, their, political, careers, serving, together, in, the, continental, congress, in, the, 1770s, and, in, europe, in, the, 1780s, the, federalist, republican, split, of, the, 1790s, divided, them, however, and, adams, felt, betrayed, by, jefferson, s, sponsorship, of, partisan, attacks, such, as, those, of, james, callender, jefferson, was, angered, by, adams, appointment, of, midnight, judges, the, two, men, did, not, communicate, directly, for, more, than, a, decade, after, jefferson, succeeded, adams, as, president, a, brief, correspondence, took, place, between, abigail, adams, and, jefferson, after, jefferson, s, daughter, polly, died, in, 1804, in, an, attempt, at, reconciliation, unknown, to, adams, however, an, exchange, of, letters, resumed, open, hostilities, between, adams, and, jefferson, as, early, as, 1809, benjamin, rush, began, to, prod, the, two, through, correspondence, to, re, establish, contact, in, 1812, adams, wrote, a, short, new, year, s, greeting, to, jefferson, prompted, earlier, by, rush, to, which, jefferson, warmly, responded, this, initial, correspondence, began, what, historian, david, mccullough, calls, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, correspondences, in, american, history, over, the, next, 14, years, jefferson, and, adams, exchanged, 158, letters, discussing, their, political, differences, justifying, their, respective, roles, in, events, and, debating, the, revolution, s, import, to, the, world, when, adams, died, on, july, 4, 1826, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, declaration, of, independence, his, last, words, were, an, acknowledgment, of, his, longtime, friend, and, rival, thomas, jefferson, survives, adams, said, unaware, that, jefferson, had, died, a, few, hours, earlier, in, 1821, at, the, age, of, 77, jefferson, began, writing, his, autobiography, of, thomas, jefferson, 1743, 1790, in, which, he, said, he, sought, to, state, some, recollections, of, dates, and, facts, concerning, myself, he, focused, on, the, struggles, and, achievements, he, experienced, until, july, 29, 1790, where, the, narrative, stopped, short, he, excluded, his, youth, emphasizing, the, revolutionary, era, he, related, that, his, ancestors, came, from, wales, to, america, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, settled, in, the, western, frontier, of, the, virginia, colony, which, influenced, his, zeal, for, individual, and, state, rights, jefferson, described, his, father, as, uneducated, but, with, a, strong, mind, and, sound, judgement, he, also, addressed, his, enrollment, in, the, college, of, william, and, mary, and, his, election, to, the, continental, congress, in, philadelphia, in, 1775, he, expressed, opposition, to, the, idea, of, a, privileged, aristocracy, made, up, of, large, landowning, families, partial, to, the, king, and, instead, promoted, the, aristocracy, of, virtue, and, talent, which, nature, has, wisely, provided, for, the, direction, of, the, interests, of, society, scattered, with, equal, hand, through, all, its, conditions, was, deemed, essential, to, a, well, ordered, republic, the, work, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, declaration, and, reforming, the, government, of, virginia, he, used, notes, letters, and, documents, to, tell, many, of, the, stories, he, suggested, that, this, history, was, so, rich, that, his, personal, affairs, were, better, overlooked, but, he, incorporated, a, self, analysis, using, the, declaration, and, other, patriotism, thomas, jefferson, was, a, philhellene, lover, of, greek, culture, who, sympathized, with, the, greek, war, of, independence, he, has, been, described, as, the, most, influential, of, the, founding, fathers, who, supported, the, greek, cause, viewing, it, as, similar, to, the, american, revolution, by, 1823, jefferson, was, exchanging, ideas, with, greek, scholar, adamantios, korais, jefferson, advised, korais, on, building, the, political, system, of, greece, by, using, classical, liberalism, and, examples, from, the, american, governmental, system, ultimately, prescribing, a, government, akin, to, that, of, a, u, s, state, he, also, suggested, the, application, of, a, classical, education, system, for, the, newly, founded, first, hellenic, republic, jefferson, s, philosophical, instructions, were, welcomed, by, the, greek, people, korais, became, one, of, the, designers, of, the, greek, constitution, and, urged, his, associates, to, study, jefferson, s, works, and, other, literature, from, the, american, revolution, in, the, summer, of, 1824, the, marquis, de, lafayette, accepted, an, invitation, from, president, james, monroe, to, visit, the, country, jefferson, and, lafayette, had, not, seen, each, other, since, 1789, after, visits, to, new, york, new, england, and, washington, lafayette, arrived, at, monticello, on, november, 4, jefferson, s, grandson, randolph, was, present, and, recorded, the, reunion, as, they, approached, each, other, their, uncertain, gait, quickened, itself, into, a, shuffling, run, and, exclaiming, ah, jefferson, ah, lafayette, they, burst, into, tears, as, they, fell, into, each, other, s, arms, jefferson, and, lafayette, then, retired, to, the, house, to, reminisce, the, next, morning, jefferson, lafayette, and, james, madison, attended, a, tour, and, banquet, at, the, university, of, virginia, jefferson, had, someone, else, read, a, speech, he, had, prepared, for, lafayette, as, his, voice, was, weak, and, could, not, carry, this, was, his, last, public, presentation, after, an, 11, day, visit, lafayette, bid, jefferson, goodbye, and, departed, monticello, jefferson, s, approximately, 100, 000, of, debt, weighed, heavily, on, his, mind, in, his, final, months, as, it, became, increasingly, clear, that, he, would, have, little, to, leave, to, his, heirs, in, february, 1826, he, successfully, applied, to, the, general, assembly, to, hold, a, public, lottery, as, a, fundraiser, his, health, began, to, deteriorate, in, july, 1825, due, to, a, combination, of, rheumatism, from, arm, and, wrist, injuries, and, intestinal, and, urinary, disorders, by, june, 1826, he, was, confined, to, bed, on, july, 3, overcome, by, fever, jefferson, declined, an, invitation, to, attend, an, anniversary, celebration, of, the, declaration, in, washington, during, his, last, hours, he, was, accompanied, by, family, members, and, friends, jefferson, died, on, july, 4, 1826, at, 12, 50, p, m, at, age, 83, on, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, adoption, of, the, declaration, of, independence, in, the, moments, prior, to, his, death, jefferson, instructed, his, treating, physician, no, doctor, nothing, more, refusing, laudanum, but, his, final, significant, words, were, is, it, the, fourth, or, this, is, the, fourth, when, john, adams, died, later, that, same, day, his, last, words, were, thomas, jefferson, survives, though, adams, was, unaware, that, jefferson, had, died, several, hours, before, the, sitting, president, was, adams, s, son, john, quincy, adams, and, he, called, the, coincidence, of, their, deaths, on, the, nation, s, anniversary, visible, and, palpable, remarks, of, divine, favor, shortly, after, jefferson, died, attendants, found, a, gold, locket, on, a, chain, around, his, neck, containing, a, small, faded, blue, ribbon, around, a, lock, of, his, wife, martha, s, hair, jefferson, was, interred, at, monticello, under, an, epitaph, that, he, wrote, here, was, buried, thomas, jefferson, author, of, the, declaration, of, american, independence, of, the, statute, of, virginia, for, religious, freedom, and, father, of, the, university, of, virginia, in, his, advanced, years, jefferson, became, increasingly, concerned, that, people, would, understand, the, principles, in, the, declaration, of, independence, and, the, people, responsible, for, writing, it, and, he, continually, defended, himself, as, its, author, he, considered, the, document, one, of, his, greatest, life, achievements, in, addition, to, authoring, the, statute, of, virginia, for, religious, freedom, and, founding, the, university, of, virginia, absent, from, his, epitaph, were, his, political, roles, including, his, presidency, jefferson, died, deeply, in, debt, and, was, unable, to, pass, on, his, estate, freely, to, his, heirs, he, gave, instructions, in, his, will, for, disposal, of, his, assets, including, the, freeing, of, sally, hemings, s, children, but, his, estate, possessions, and, slaves, were, sold, at, public, auctions, starting, in, 1827, in, 1831, monticello, was, sold, by, martha, jefferson, randolph, and, the, other, heirs, jefferson, subscribed, to, the, political, ideals, expounded, by, john, locke, francis, bacon, and, isaac, newton, whom, he, considered, the, three, greatest, men, who, ever, lived, he, was, also, influenced, by, the, writings, of, gibbon, hume, robertson, bolingbroke, montesquieu, and, voltaire, jefferson, thought, that, the, independent, yeoman, and, agrarian, life, were, ideals, of, republican, virtues, he, distrusted, cities, and, financiers, favored, decentralized, government, power, and, believed, that, the, tyranny, that, had, plagued, the, common, man, in, europe, was, due, to, corrupt, political, establishments, and, monarchies, he, supported, efforts, to, disestablish, the, church, of, england, wrote, the, virginia, statute, for, religious, freedom, and, he, pressed, for, a, wall, of, separation, between, church, and, state, the, republicans, under, jefferson, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, 18th, century, british, whig, party, which, believed, in, limited, government, his, democratic, republican, party, became, dominant, in, early, american, politics, and, his, views, became, known, as, jeffersonian, democracy, jefferson, wrote, letters, and, speeches, prolifically, these, show, him, to, be, well, read, in, the, philosophical, literature, of, his, day, and, of, antiquity, nevertheless, some, scholars, do, not, take, jefferson, seriously, as, a, philosopher, mainly, because, he, did, not, produce, a, formal, work, on, philosophy, however, he, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, outstanding, philosophical, figures, of, his, time, because, his, work, provided, the, theoretical, background, to, and, the, substance, of, the, social, and, political, events, of, the, revolutionary, years, and, the, development, of, the, american, constitution, in, the, 1770s, and, 1780s, jefferson, continued, to, attend, to, more, theoretical, questions, of, natural, philosophy, and, subsequently, left, behind, a, rich, philosophical, legacy, in, the, form, of, presidential, messages, letters, and, public, papers, jefferson, described, himself, as, an, epicurean, and, although, he, adopted, the, stoic, belief, in, intuition, and, found, comfort, in, the, stoic, emphasis, on, the, patient, endurance, of, misfortune, he, rejected, most, aspects, of, stoicism, with, the, notable, exception, of, epictetus, works, he, rejected, the, stoics, doctrine, of, a, separable, soul, and, their, fatalism, and, was, angered, by, their, misrepresentation, of, epicureanism, as, mere, hedonism, jefferson, knew, epicurean, philosophy, from, original, sources, but, also, mentioned, pierre, gassendi, s, syntagma, philosophicum, as, influencing, his, ideas, on, epicureanism, according, to, jefferson, s, philosophy, citizens, have, certain, inalienable, rights, and, rightful, liberty, is, unobstructed, action, according, to, our, will, within, limits, drawn, around, us, by, the, equal, rights, of, others, a, staunch, advocate, of, the, jury, system, he, proclaimed, in, 1801, i, consider, as, the, only, anchor, yet, imagined, by, man, by, which, a, government, can, be, held, to, the, principles, of, its, constitution, jeffersonian, government, not, only, prohibited, individuals, in, society, from, infringing, on, the, liberty, of, others, but, also, restrained, itself, from, diminishing, individual, liberty, as, a, protection, against, tyranny, of, the, majority, initially, jefferson, favored, restricted, voting, to, those, who, could, actually, have, the, free, exercise, of, their, reason, by, escaping, any, corrupting, dependence, on, others, he, advocated, enfranchising, a, majority, of, virginians, seeking, to, expand, suffrage, to, include, yeoman, farmers, who, owned, their, own, land, while, excluding, tenant, farmers, city, day, laborers, vagrants, most, american, indians, and, women, he, was, convinced, that, individual, liberties, were, the, fruit, of, political, equality, which, was, threatened, by, the, arbitrary, government, excesses, of, democracy, in, his, view, were, caused, by, institutional, corruption, rather, than, human, nature, he, was, less, suspicious, of, a, working, democracy, than, many, contemporaries, as, president, jefferson, feared, that, the, federal, system, enacted, by, washington, and, adams, had, encouraged, corrupting, patronage, and, dependence, he, tried, to, restore, a, balance, between, the, state, and, federal, governments, more, nearly, reflecting, the, articles, of, confederation, seeking, to, reinforce, state, prerogatives, where, his, party, was, in, a, majority, jefferson, was, steeped, in, the, whig, tradition, of, the, oppressed, majority, set, against, a, repeatedly, unresponsive, court, party, in, the, parliament, he, justified, small, outbreaks, of, rebellion, as, necessary, to, get, monarchial, regimes, to, amend, oppressive, measures, compromising, popular, liberties, in, a, republican, regime, ruled, by, the, majority, he, acknowledged, it, will, often, be, exercised, when, wrong, but, the, remedy, is, to, set, them, right, as, to, facts, pardon, and, pacify, them, as, jefferson, saw, his, party, triumph, in, two, terms, of, his, presidency, and, launch, into, a, third, term, under, james, madison, his, view, of, the, u, s, as, a, continental, republic, and, an, empire, of, liberty, grew, more, upbeat, on, departing, the, presidency, he, described, america, as, trusted, with, the, destines, of, this, solitary, republic, of, the, world, the, only, monument, of, human, rights, and, the, sole, depository, of, the, sacred, fire, of, freedom, and, self, government, jefferson, was, a, supporter, of, american, expansionism, writing, in, 1801, that, it, is, impossible, not, to, look, forward, to, distant, times, when, our, rapid, multiplication, will, expand, itself, beyond, those, limits, and, cover, the, whole, northern, if, not, the, southern, continent, jefferson, considered, democracy, to, be, the, expression, of, society, and, promoted, national, self, determination, cultural, uniformity, and, education, of, all, males, of, the, commonwealth, he, supported, public, education, and, a, free, press, as, essential, components, of, a, democratic, nation, after, resigning, as, secretary, of, state, in, 1795, jefferson, focused, on, the, electoral, bases, of, the, republicans, and, federalists, the, republican, classification, for, which, he, advocated, included, the, entire, body, of, landholders, everywhere, and, the, body, of, laborers, without, land, republicans, united, behind, jefferson, as, vice, president, with, the, election, of, 1796, expanding, democracy, nationwide, at, grassroots, levels, jefferson, promoted, republican, candidates, for, local, offices, beginning, with, jefferson, s, electioneering, for, the, revolution, of, 1800, his, political, efforts, were, based, on, egalitarian, appeals, in, his, later, years, he, referred, to, the, 1800, election, as, real, a, revolution, in, the, principles, of, our, government, as, that, of, 76, was, in, its, form, one, not, effected, indeed, by, the, sword, but, by, the, suffrage, of, the, people, voter, participation, grew, during, jefferson, s, presidency, increasing, to, unimaginable, levels, compared, to, the, federalist, era, with, turnout, of, about, 67, 000, in, 1800, rising, to, about, 143, 000, in, 1804, at, the, onset, of, the, american, revolution, jefferson, accepted, william, blackstone, s, argument, that, property, ownership, would, sufficiently, empower, voters, independent, judgement, but, he, sought, to, further, expand, suffrage, by, land, distribution, to, the, poor, in, the, heat, of, the, revolutionary, era, and, afterward, several, states, expanded, voter, eligibility, from, landed, gentry, to, all, propertied, male, tax, paying, citizens, with, jefferson, s, support, in, retirement, he, gradually, became, critical, of, his, home, state, for, violating, the, principle, of, equal, political, rights, the, social, right, of, universal, male, suffrage, he, sought, a, general, suffrage, of, all, taxpayers, and, militia, men, and, equal, representation, by, population, in, the, general, assembly, to, correct, preferential, treatment, of, the, slave, holding, regions, baptized, in, his, youth, jefferson, became, a, governing, member, of, his, local, episcopal, church, in, charlottesville, which, he, later, attended, with, his, daughters, jefferson, however, spurned, biblical, views, of, christianity, influenced, by, deist, authors, during, his, college, years, jefferson, abandoned, orthodox, christianity, after, his, review, of, new, testament, teachings, jefferson, has, sometimes, been, portrayed, as, a, follower, of, the, liberal, religious, strand, of, deism, that, values, reason, over, revelation, nonetheless, in, 1803, jefferson, asserted, i, am, christian, in, the, only, sense, in, which, wished, any, one, to, be, jefferson, later, defined, being, a, christian, as, one, who, followed, the, simple, teachings, of, jesus, influenced, by, joseph, priestley, jefferson, selected, new, testament, passages, of, jesus, teachings, into, a, private, work, he, called, the, life, and, morals, of, jesus, of, nazareth, known, today, as, the, jefferson, bible, which, was, never, published, during, his, lifetime, jefferson, believed, that, jesus, message, had, been, obscured, and, corrupted, by, paul, the, apostle, the, gospel, writers, and, protestant, reformers, peterson, states, that, jefferson, was, a, theist, whose, god, was, the, creator, of, the, universe, all, the, evidences, of, nature, testified, to, his, perfection, and, man, could, rely, on, the, harmony, and, beneficence, of, his, work, in, a, letter, to, john, adams, jefferson, wrote, that, what, he, believed, was, genuinely, christ, s, found, in, the, gospels, was, as, easily, distinguishable, as, diamonds, in, a, dunghill, by, omitting, miracles, and, the, resurrection, jefferson, made, the, figure, of, jesus, more, compatible, with, a, worldview, based, on, reason, jefferson, was, firmly, anticlerical, writing, in, every, age, the, priest, has, been, hostile, to, liberty, they, have, perverted, the, purest, religion, ever, preached, to, man, into, mystery, and, jargon, the, full, letter, to, horatio, spatford, can, be, read, at, the, national, archives, jefferson, once, supported, banning, clergy, from, public, office, but, later, relented, in, 1777, he, drafted, the, virginia, statute, for, religious, freedom, ratified, in, 1786, it, made, compelling, attendance, or, contributions, to, any, state, sanctioned, religious, establishment, illegal, and, declared, that, men, shall, be, free, to, profess, their, opinions, in, matters, of, religion, the, statute, is, one, of, only, three, accomplishments, he, chose, for, his, epitaph, early, in, 1802, jefferson, wrote, to, the, danbury, connecticut, baptist, association, that, religion, is, a, matter, which, lies, solely, between, man, and, his, god, he, interpreted, the, first, amendment, as, having, built, a, wall, of, separation, between, church, and, state, the, phrase, separation, of, church, and, state, has, been, cited, several, times, by, the, supreme, court, in, its, interpretation, of, the, establishment, clause, jefferson, donated, to, the, american, bible, society, saying, the, four, evangelists, delivered, a, pure, and, sublime, system, of, morality, to, humanity, he, thought, americans, would, rationally, create, apiarian, religion, extracting, the, best, traditions, of, every, denomination, he, contributed, generously, to, several, local, denominations, near, monticello, acknowledging, organized, religion, would, always, be, factored, into, political, life, he, encouraged, reason, over, supernatural, revelation, to, make, inquiries, into, religion, he, believed, in, a, creator, god, an, afterlife, and, the, sum, of, religion, as, loving, god, and, neighbors, but, he, also, controversially, rejected, fundamental, christian, beliefs, denying, the, conventional, christian, trinity, jesus, s, divinity, as, the, son, of, god, and, miracles, the, resurrection, of, christ, atonement, from, sin, and, original, sin, jefferson, believed, that, original, sin, was, a, gross, injustice, jefferson, s, unorthodox, religious, beliefs, became, an, important, issue, in, the, 1800, presidential, election, federalists, attacked, him, as, an, atheist, as, president, jefferson, countered, the, accusations, by, praising, religion, in, his, inaugural, address, and, attending, services, at, the, capitol, jefferson, distrusted, government, banks, and, opposed, public, borrowing, which, he, thought, created, long, term, debt, bred, monopolies, and, invited, dangerous, speculation, as, opposed, to, productive, labor, in, one, letter, to, madison, he, argued, each, generation, should, curtail, all, debt, within, 19, years, and, not, impose, a, long, term, debt, on, subsequent, generations, in, 1791, president, washington, asked, jefferson, then, secretary, of, state, and, hamilton, the, secretary, of, the, treasury, if, the, congress, had, the, authority, to, create, a, national, bank, while, hamilton, believed, so, jefferson, and, madison, thought, a, national, bank, would, ignore, the, needs, of, individuals, and, farmers, and, would, violate, the, tenth, amendment, by, assuming, powers, not, granted, to, the, federal, government, by, the, states, hamilton, successfully, argued, that, the, implied, powers, given, to, the, federal, government, in, the, constitution, supported, the, creation, of, a, national, bank, among, other, federal, actions, jefferson, used, agrarian, resistance, to, banks, and, speculators, as, the, first, defining, principle, of, an, opposition, party, recruiting, candidates, for, congress, on, the, issue, as, early, as, 1792, as, president, jefferson, was, persuaded, by, secretary, of, the, treasury, albert, gallatin, to, leave, the, bank, intact, but, sought, to, restrain, its, influence, scholars, give, radically, differing, interpretations, on, jefferson, s, views, and, relationship, with, slavery, opinions, range, from, emancipationists, who, view, him, as, an, early, proto, abolitionist, who, subsequently, made, pragmatic, compromises, with, the, slave, power, to, preserve, the, union, to, revisionists, who, argue, that, he, in, fact, entrenched, the, institution, in, american, society, with, people, also, having, more, nuanced, opinions, who, either, argue, that, jefferson, held, inconsistent, views, on, the, institution, throughout, his, lifetime, or, that, both, interpretations, are, too, overly, simplistic, jefferson, lived, in, a, planter, economy, largely, dependent, upon, slavery, and, as, a, wealthy, landholder, used, slave, labor, for, his, household, plantation, and, workshops, he, first, recorded, his, slaveholding, in, 1774, when, he, counted, 41, enslaved, people, over, his, lifetime, he, enslaved, about, 600, people, he, inherited, about, 175, people, while, most, of, the, remainder, were, people, born, on, his, plantations, jefferson, purchased, some, slaves, in, order, to, reunite, their, families, he, sold, approximately, 110, people, for, economic, reasons, primarily, slaves, from, his, outlying, farms, in, 1784, when, the, number, of, people, he, enslaved, likely, was, approximately, 200, he, began, to, divest, himself, of, many, slaves, and, by, 1794, he, had, divested, himself, of, 161, individuals, approximately, 100, slaves, lived, at, monticello, at, any, given, time, in, 1817, the, plantation, recorded, its, largest, slave, population, of, 140, individuals, jefferson, once, said, my, first, wish, is, that, the, labourers, may, be, well, treated, jefferson, did, not, work, his, slaves, on, sundays, and, christmas, and, he, allowed, them, more, personal, time, during, the, winter, months, some, scholars, doubt, jefferson, s, benevolence, noting, cases, of, excessive, slave, whippings, in, his, absence, his, nail, factory, was, staffed, only, by, enslaved, children, many, of, the, enslaved, boys, became, tradesmen, burwell, colbert, who, started, his, working, life, as, a, child, in, monticello, s, nailery, was, later, promoted, to, the, supervisory, position, of, butler, jefferson, felt, slavery, was, harmful, to, both, slave, and, master, but, had, reservations, about, releasing, slaves, from, captivity, and, advocated, for, gradual, emancipation, in, 1779, he, proposed, gradual, voluntary, training, and, resettlement, to, the, virginia, legislature, and, three, years, later, drafted, legislation, allowing, slaveholders, to, free, their, own, slaves, in, his, draft, of, the, declaration, of, independence, he, included, a, section, stricken, by, other, southern, delegates, criticizing, king, george, iii, for, supposedly, forcing, slavery, onto, the, colonies, in, 1784, jefferson, proposed, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, all, western, u, s, territories, limiting, slave, importation, to, 15, years, congress, however, failed, to, pass, his, proposal, by, one, vote, in, 1787, congress, passed, the, northwest, ordinance, a, partial, victory, for, jefferson, that, terminated, slavery, in, the, northwest, territory, jefferson, freed, his, slave, robert, hemings, in, 1794, and, he, freed, his, cook, slave, james, hemings, in, 1796, jefferson, freed, his, runaway, slave, harriet, hemings, in, 1822, upon, his, death, in, 1826, jefferson, freed, five, male, hemings, slaves, in, his, will, during, his, presidency, jefferson, allowed, the, diffusion, of, slavery, into, the, louisiana, territory, hoping, to, prevent, slave, uprisings, in, virginia, and, to, prevent, south, carolina, secession, in, 1804, in, a, compromise, jefferson, and, congress, banned, domestic, slave, trafficking, for, one, year, into, the, louisiana, territory, in, 1806, he, officially, called, for, anti, slavery, legislation, terminating, the, import, or, export, of, slaves, congress, passed, the, law, in, 1807, in, 1819, jefferson, strongly, opposed, a, missouri, statehood, application, amendment, that, banned, domestic, slave, importation, and, freed, slaves, at, the, age, of, 25, on, grounds, it, would, destroy, the, union, in, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, he, created, controversy, by, calling, slavery, a, moral, evil, for, which, the, nation, would, ultimately, have, to, account, to, god, jefferson, wrote, of, his, suspicion, that, black, people, were, mentally, and, physically, inferior, to, whites, but, argued, that, they, nonetheless, had, innate, human, rights, he, therefore, supported, colonization, plans, that, would, transport, freed, slaves, to, another, country, such, as, liberia, or, sierra, leone, though, he, recognized, the, impracticability, of, such, proposals, according, to, eric, foner, in, 1824, jefferson, proposed, that, the, federal, government, purchase, and, deport, the, increase, of, each, year, that, is, children, so, that, the, slave, population, would, age, and, eventually, disappear, during, his, presidency, jefferson, was, for, the, most, part, publicly, silent, on, the, issue, of, slavery, and, emancipation, as, the, congressional, debate, over, slavery, and, its, extension, caused, a, dangerous, north, south, rift, among, the, states, with, talk, of, a, northern, confederacy, in, new, england, the, violent, attacks, on, white, slave, owners, during, the, haitian, revolution, due, to, injustices, under, slavery, supported, jefferson, s, fears, of, a, race, war, increasing, his, reservations, about, promoting, emancipation, after, numerous, attempts, and, failures, to, bring, about, emancipation, jefferson, wrote, privately, in, an, 1805, letter, to, william, a, burwell, i, have, long, since, given, up, the, expectation, of, any, early, provision, for, the, extinguishment, of, slavery, among, us, that, same, year, he, also, related, this, idea, to, george, logan, writing, i, have, most, carefully, avoided, every, public, act, or, manifestation, on, that, subject, claims, that, jefferson, fathered, children, with, his, slave, sally, hemings, after, his, wife, s, death, have, been, debated, since, 1802, in, that, year, james, t, callender, after, being, denied, a, position, as, postmaster, alleged, jefferson, had, taken, hemings, as, a, concubine, and, fathered, several, children, with, her, in, 1998, a, panel, of, researchers, conducted, a, y, dna, study, of, living, descendants, of, jefferson, s, uncle, field, and, of, a, descendant, of, hemings, s, son, eston, hemings, the, results, showed, a, match, with, the, male, jefferson, line, subsequently, the, thomas, jefferson, foundation, tjf, formed, a, nine, member, research, team, of, historians, to, assess, the, matter, the, tjf, report, concluded, that, the, dna, study, indicates, a, high, probability, that, thomas, jefferson, fathered, eston, hemings, the, tjf, also, concluded, that, jefferson, likely, fathered, all, of, hemings, s, children, listed, at, monticello, in, july, 2017, the, tjf, announced, that, archeological, excavations, at, monticello, had, revealed, what, they, believe, to, have, been, sally, hemings, s, quarters, adjacent, to, jefferson, s, bedroom, since, the, results, of, the, dna, tests, were, made, public, the, consensus, among, most, historians, has, been, that, jefferson, had, a, sexual, relationship, with, sally, hemings, and, that, he, was, the, father, of, her, son, eston, hemings, still, a, minority, of, scholars, maintain, the, evidence, is, insufficient, to, prove, jefferson, s, paternity, conclusively, based, on, dna, and, other, evidence, they, note, the, possibility, that, additional, jefferson, males, including, his, brother, randolph, jefferson, and, any, one, of, randolph, s, four, sons, or, his, cousin, could, have, fathered, sally, hemings, s, children, in, 2002, historian, merrill, peterson, said, in, the, absence, of, direct, documentary, evidence, either, proving, or, refuting, the, allegation, nothing, conclusive, can, be, said, about, jefferson, s, relations, with, sally, hemings, concerning, the, 1998, dna, study, peterson, said, that, the, results, of, the, dna, testing, of, jefferson, and, hemings, descendants, provided, support, for, the, idea, that, jefferson, was, the, father, of, at, least, one, of, sally, hemings, s, children, after, jefferson, s, death, in, 1826, although, not, formally, manumitted, sally, hemings, was, allowed, by, jefferson, s, daughter, martha, to, live, in, charlottesville, as, a, free, woman, with, her, two, sons, until, her, death, in, 1835, the, monticello, association, refused, to, allow, sally, hemings, descendants, the, right, of, burial, at, monticello, jefferson, was, a, farmer, obsessed, with, new, crops, soil, conditions, garden, designs, and, scientific, agricultural, techniques, his, main, cash, crop, was, tobacco, but, its, price, was, usually, low, and, it, was, rarely, profitable, he, tried, to, achieve, self, sufficiency, with, wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and, cattle, to, supply, his, family, slaves, and, employees, but, he, lived, perpetually, beyond, his, means, and, was, always, in, debt, jefferson, mastered, architecture, through, self, study, his, primary, authority, was, andrea, palladio, s, 1570, the, four, books, of, architecture, which, outlines, the, principles, of, classical, design, jefferson, helped, popularize, the, neo, palladian, style, in, the, united, states, utilizing, designs, for, the, virginia, state, capitol, the, university, of, virginia, monticello, and, others, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, was, inspired, by, the, ch, teau, de, rastignac, in, south, west, france, the, plans, of, which, he, saw, during, his, ambassadorship, to, convince, the, architect, of, the, white, house, to, modify, the, south, portico, to, resemble, the, ch, teau, in, the, field, of, archaeology, in, 1784, jefferson, using, the, trench, method, started, excavating, several, native, american, burial, mounds, in, virginia, his, excavations, were, prompted, by, the, moundbuilders, question, and, his, careful, methods, allowed, him, to, witness, the, stratigraphic, layout, the, various, human, remains, and, other, artifacts, inside, the, mound, the, evidence, present, at, the, site, granted, him, enough, insight, to, admit, that, he, saw, no, reason, why, the, ancestors, of, the, present, day, native, americans, could, not, have, raised, those, mounds, he, was, interested, in, birds, and, wine, and, was, a, noted, gourmet, as, a, naturalist, he, was, fascinated, by, the, natural, bridge, geological, formation, and, in, 1774, successfully, acquired, the, bridge, by, a, grant, from, george, iii, jefferson, was, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, for, 35, years, beginning, in, 1780, through, the, society, he, advanced, the, sciences, and, enlightenment, ideals, emphasizing, that, knowledge, of, science, reinforced, and, extended, freedom, his, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, was, written, in, part, as, a, contribution, to, the, society, he, became, the, society, s, third, president, on, march, 3, 1797, a, few, months, after, he, was, elected, vice, president, of, the, united, states, in, accepting, jefferson, stated, i, feel, no, qualification, for, this, distinguished, post, but, a, sincere, zeal, for, all, the, objects, of, our, institution, and, an, ardent, desire, to, see, knowledge, so, disseminated, through, the, mass, of, mankind, that, it, may, at, length, reach, even, the, extremes, of, society, beggars, and, kings, on, march, 10, 1797, thomas, jefferson, gave, a, lecture, later, published, as, a, paper, in, 1799, which, reported, on, the, skeletal, remains, of, an, extinct, large, sloth, which, he, named, megalonyx, unearthed, by, saltpeter, workers, from, a, cave, in, what, is, now, monroe, county, west, virginia, jefferson, is, considered, to, be, a, pioneer, of, scientific, paleontology, research, in, north, america, jefferson, served, as, aps, president, for, the, next, eighteen, years, including, through, both, terms, of, his, presidency, he, introduced, meriwether, lewis, to, the, society, where, various, scientists, tutored, him, in, preparation, for, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, he, resigned, on, january, 20, 1815, but, remained, active, through, correspondence, jefferson, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, linguistics, and, could, speak, read, and, write, in, a, number, of, languages, including, french, greek, italian, and, german, in, his, early, years, he, excelled, in, classical, languages, jefferson, later, came, to, regard, greek, as, the, perfect, language, as, expressed, in, its, laws, and, philosophy, while, attending, the, college, of, william, mary, he, taught, himself, italian, here, jefferson, first, became, familiar, with, the, anglo, saxon, language, studying, it, in, a, linguistic, and, philosophical, capacity, he, owned, 17, volumes, of, anglo, saxon, texts, and, grammar, and, later, wrote, an, essay, on, the, anglo, saxon, language, jefferson, claimed, to, have, taught, himself, spanish, during, his, nineteen, day, journey, to, france, using, only, a, grammar, guide, and, a, copy, of, don, quixote, linguistics, played, a, significant, role, in, how, jefferson, modeled, and, expressed, political, and, philosophical, ideas, he, believed, that, the, study, of, ancient, languages, was, essential, in, understanding, the, roots, of, modern, language, jefferson, criticized, language, purists, and, supported, the, introduction, of, neologisms, to, english, foreseeing, the, emergence, of, an, american, dialect, he, described, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, a, body, designated, to, regulate, the, french, language, as, an, endeavor, to, arrest, the, progress, of, their, language, he, collected, and, understood, a, number, of, american, indian, vocabularies, and, instructed, lewis, and, clark, to, record, and, collect, various, indian, languages, during, their, expedition, when, jefferson, moved, from, washington, after, his, presidency, he, took, 50, native, american, vocabulary, lists, back, to, monticello, along, with, the, rest, of, his, possessions, somewhere, along, the, journey, a, thief, stole, the, heavy, chest, thinking, it, was, full, of, valuables, but, its, contents, were, dumped, into, the, james, river, when, the, thief, discovered, it, was, only, filled, with, papers, thirty, years, of, collecting, were, lost, with, only, a, few, fragments, rescued, from, the, muddy, banks, of, the, river, jefferson, was, not, an, outstanding, orator, and, preferred, to, communicate, through, writing, or, remain, silent, if, possible, instead, of, delivering, his, state, of, the, union, addresses, himself, jefferson, wrote, the, annual, messages, and, sent, a, representative, to, read, them, aloud, in, congress, this, started, a, tradition, that, continued, until, 1913, when, president, woodrow, wilson, chose, to, deliver, his, own, state, of, the, union, address, jefferson, invented, many, small, practical, devices, and, improved, contemporary, inventions, including, a, revolving, book, stand, and, a, great, clock, powered, by, the, gravitational, pull, on, cannonballs, he, improved, the, pedometer, the, polygraph, a, device, for, duplicating, writing, and, the, moldboard, plow, an, idea, he, never, patented, and, gave, to, posterity, jefferson, can, also, be, credited, as, the, creator, of, the, swivel, chair, the, first, of, which, he, created, and, used, to, write,
