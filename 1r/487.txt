musical, education, given, to, her, by, her, father, clara, wieck, learned, to, compose, and, from, childhood, to, middle, age, she, produced, a, good, body, of, work, clara, wrote, that, composing, gives, me, great, pleasure, there, is, nothing, that, surpasses, the, joy, of, creation, if, only, because, through, it, one, wins, hours, of, self, forgetfulness, when, one, lives, in, a, world, of, sound, her, op, 1, was, quatre, polonaises, pour, le, pianoforte, composed, in, 1831, and, op, 5, 4, pi, ces, caract, ristiques, in, 1836, all, piano, pieces, for, her, recitals, she, wrote, her, piano, concerto, in, a, minor, at, age, 14, with, some, help, from, her, future, husband, she, planned, a, second, piano, concerto, but, only, a, konzertsatz, in, f, minor, from, 1847, survived,

and, three, romances, for, violin, and, piano, op, 22, 1853, inspired, by, her, husband, s, birthday, they, were, dedicated, to, joachim, who, performed, them, for, george, v, of, hanover, who, declared, them, a, marvellous, heavenly, pleasure, as, she, grew, older, she, became, more, preoccupied, with, other, responsibilities, in, life, and, found, it, hard, to, compose, regularly, writing, i, once, believed, that, i, possessed, creative, talent, but, i, have, given, up, this, idea, a, woman, must, not, desire, to, compose, there, has, never, yet, been, one, able, to, do, it, should, i, expect, to, be, the, one, her, husband, also, expressed, concern, about, the, effect, on, her, composing, output, clara, has, composed, a, series, of, small, pieces, which, show, a, musical, and, tender, ingenuity, such, as, she, has, never, attained, before, but, to, have, children, and, a, husband, who, is, always, living, in, the, realm, of, imagination, does, not, go, together, with, composing, she, cannot, work, at, it, regularly, and, i, am, often, disturbed, to, think, how, many, profound, ideas, are, lost, because, she, cannot, work, them, out, she, produced, one, to, eight, compositions, every, year, beginning, at, age, 11, until, her, output, stopped, in, 1848, producing, only, a, choral, work, that, year, for, her, husband, s, birthday, and, leaving, her, second, piano, concerto, unfinished, these, two, works, while, reserved, for, her, opus, 18, and, 19, were, never, published, five, years, later, however, when, she, was, 34, in, 1853, the, year, she, met, brahms, she, engaged, in, a, flurry, of, composing, resulting, in, 16, pieces, that, year, a, set, of, piano, variations, on, an, album, leaf, of, her, husband, his, op, 99, no, 4, eight, romances, for, piano, solo, and, for, violin, and, piano, and, seven, songs, these, works, were, published, a, year, later, after, robert, s, confinement, as, her, op, 20, through, 23, for, the, next, 43, years, of, her, life, she, only, composed, piano, transcriptions, of, works, by, her, husband, and, brahms, including, 41, transcriptions, of, robert, schumann, s, lieder, commissioned, by, a, publisher, in, 1872, and, a, short, piano, duet, commissioned, for, a, friend, s, wedding, anniversary, in, 1879, in, the, last, year, of, her, life, she, left, several, sketches, for, piano, preludes, designed, for, piano, students, as, well, as, some, published, cadenzas, for, her, performances, of, beethoven, and, mozart, piano, concertos, most, of, clara, schumann, s, music, was, never, played, by, anyone, else, and, largely, forgotten, until, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, the, 1970s, today, her, compositions, are, increasingly, performed, and, recorded, schumann, was, the, authoritative, editor, aided, by, brahms, and, others, of, her, husband, s, works, for, the, publishing, firm, of, breitkopf, h, rtel, she, also, edited, 20, sonatas, by, domenico, scarlatti, letters, jugendbriefe, by, her, husband, in, 1885, and, his, piano, works, with, fingering, and, other, instructions, fingersatz, und, vortragsbezeichnungen, in, 1886, in, the, early, 1840s, the, schumanns, were, interested, in, the, works, of, franz, liszt, and, his, young, composer, friends, of, what, eventually, became, known, as, the, new, german, school, but, in, the, second, half, of, the, decade, they, both, became, openly, hostile, toward, liszt, because, of, their, more, musically, conservative, outlook, and, beliefs, clara, more, so, than, robert, as, she, had, long, been, the, more, conservative, aesthete, in, the, schumann, marriage, by, the, mid, 1850s, after, robert, s, decline, the, young, brahms, had, joined, the, cause, and, to, promote, her, ideals, and, protect, what, she, saw, as, an, attack, on, her, husband, s, beliefs, she, brahms, and, joseph, joachim, formed, a, group, of, conservative, musicians, who, defended, robert, schumann, s, critical, ideals, of, the, legacy, and, respectability, of, music, the, pinnacle, of, which, had, been, beethoven, the, opposing, side, of, this, war, of, the, romantics, a, group, of, radical, progressives, in, music, most, of, them, from, weimar, led, by, liszt, and, richard, wagner, desired, to, escape, composing, under, the, shadow, of, beethoven, but, to, transcend, the, old, forms, and, ideas, of, what, music, had, been, and, instead, create, what, music, should, be, for, the, future, the, weimar, school, promoted, the, idea, of, program, music, while, both, the, schumanns, and, brahms, of, the, leipzig, berlin, school, were, strict, in, their, stance, that, music, must, and, can, only, be, absolute, music, a, term, derisively, coined, by, wagner, one, of, clara, schumann, s, difficulties, with, liszt, stemmed, from, a, philosophical, difference, in, performance, practice, he, believed, that, the, artist, through, physical, and, emotional, performance, interpreted, music, for, the, audience, when, he, performed, liszt, flailed, his, arms, tossed, his, head, and, pursed, his, lips, inspiring, a, lisztomania, across, europe, which, has, been, compared, to, the, beatlemania, of, female, fans, of, the, beatles, over, a, century, later, clara, in, contrast, came, to, believe, that, the, personality, of, the, musician, should, be, suppressed, so, that, the, composer, s, vision, would, be, clearly, evident, to, listeners, partisans, led, active, campaigns, with, public, demonstrations, at, concerts, writings, published, in, the, press, denigrating, reputations, and, other, public, slights, designed, to, embarrass, their, adversaries, brahms, published, a, manifesto, for, the, serious, music, side, on, 4, may, 1861, signed, by, clara, schumann, joachim, albert, dietrich, woldemar, bargiel, and, twenty, others, which, decried, the, purveyors, of, the, music, of, the, future, as, contrary, to, the, innermost, spirit, of, music, strongly, to, be, deplored, and, condemned, the, new, weimar, club, a, formal, society, with, liszt, at, its, center, held, an, anniversary, celebration, of, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, the, magazine, robert, schumann, had, founded, in, his, birthplace, zwickau, and, conspicuously, neglected, to, invite, members, of, the, opposing, party, including, his, widow, clara, clara, schumann, ceased, to, perform, any, of, liszt, s, works, and, she, suppressed, her, husband, s, dedication, to, liszt, of, his, fantasie, in, c, major, when, she, published, his, complete, works, when, she, heard, that, liszt, and, richard, wagner, would, be, participating, in, a, beethoven, centenary, festival, in, vienna, in, 1870, she, refused, to, attend, in, describing, the, works, of, the, opposing, school, clara, schumann, was, particularly, scathing, of, wagner, writing, of, his, tannh, user, that, he, wears, himself, out, in, atrocities, describing, lohengrin, as, horrible, and, referring, to, tristan, und, isolde, as, the, most, repugnant, thing, i, have, ever, seen, or, heard, in, all, my, life, she, also, complained, that, wagner, had, spoken, of, her, husband, mendelssohn, and, brahms, in, a, scornful, way, wagner, had, poked, fun, at, the, musical, conservatives, in, an, essay, portraying, them, as, a, musical, temperance, society, awaiting, a, messiah, she, held, anton, bruckner, s, seventh, symphony, in, very, low, esteem, and, wrote, to, brahms, describing, it, as, a, horrible, piece, bruckner, s, symphonies, were, seen, as, representative, of, the, new, music, due, to, their, advanced, harmony, massive, orchestration, and, extended, time, scale, schumann, was, more, impressed, however, with, the, early, first, symphony, in, f, minor, by, richard, strauss, this, was, before, strauss, began, composing, the, highly, programmatic, music, for, which, he, later, became, famous, brahms, secretly, held, wagner, s, music, in, high, esteem, and, eventually, publicly, praised, liszt, s, works, as, well, several, of, the, proponents, and, signers, of, the, manifesto, including, joachim, relented, and, joined, the, other, side, the, controversy, eventually, died, down, but, clara, schumann, remained, steadfast, in, her, disapproval, of, the, new, german, school, s, music, although, schumann, was, not, widely, recognized, as, a, composer, for, many, years, after, her, death, she, had, a, lasting, effect, as, a, pianist, trained, by, her, father, to, play, by, ear, and, memorize, she, gave, public, performances, from, memory, as, early, as, age, thirteen, a, fact, noted, as, exceptional, by, her, reviewers, she, was, one, of, the, first, pianists, to, perform, from, memory, making, it, the, standard, for, concerts, she, was, also, instrumental, in, changing, the, kind, of, program, expected, of, concert, pianists, in, her, early, career, before, her, marriage, she, played, the, customary, bravura, pieces, designed, to, showcase, the, artist, s, technique, often, in, the, form, of, arrangements, or, variations, on, popular, themes, from, operas, written, by, virtuosos, such, as, thalberg, herz, or, henselt, as, it, was, customary, to, play, one, s, own, compositions, she, included, at, least, one, of, her, own, works, in, every, program, such, as, variations, on, a, theme, by, bellini, op, 8, and, the, popular, scherzo, op, 10, however, as, she, became, a, more, independent, artist, her, repertoire, contained, mainly, music, by, leading, composers, schumann, influenced, pianists, through, her, teaching, which, emphasized, expression, and, a, singing, tone, with, technique, subordinated, to, the, intentions, of, the, composer, one, of, her, students, mathilde, verne, carried, her, teaching, to, england, where, she, taught, among, others, solomon, another, of, her, students, carl, friedberg, carried, the, tradition, to, the, juilliard, school, in, america, where, his, students, included, nina, simone, malcolm, frager, and, bruce, hungerford, she, was, also, instrumental, in, getting, the, works, of, robert, schumann, recognized, appreciated, and, added, to, the, repertoire, she, promoted, his, works, tirelessly, throughout, her, life, clara, schumann, has, been, portrayed, on, screen, many, times, tr, umerei, dreaming, the, oldest, known, schumann, film, premiered, on, 3, may, 1944, in, zwickau, possibly, the, best,
