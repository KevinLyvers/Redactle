love, immediately, but, were, never, lovers, the, romance, however, is, made, clear, from, their, letters, pasternak, writing, you, do, not, know, how, my, tormenting, feeling, grew, and, grew, until, it, became, obvious, to, me, and, to, others, as, you, walked, beside, me, with, complete, detachment, i, could, not, express, it, to, you, it, was, a, rare, sort, of, closeness, as, if, we, two, you, and, i, were, in, love, with, something, that, was, utterly, indifferent, to, both, of, us, something, that, remained, aloof, from, us, by, virtue, of, its, extraordinary, inability, to, adapt, to, the, other, side, of, life, the, cousins, initial, passion, developed, into, a, lifelong, close, friendship, from, 1910, pasternak, and, freidenberg, exchanged, frequent, letters, and, their,

finals, they, met, in, marburg, during, the, summer, of, 1912, when, boris, father, leonid, pasternak, painted, her, portrait, although, professor, cohen, encouraged, him, to, remain, in, germany, and, to, pursue, a, philosophy, doctorate, pasternak, decided, against, it, he, returned, to, moscow, around, the, time, of, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, the, aftermath, of, events, pasternak, proposed, marriage, to, ida, however, the, wissotzky, family, was, disturbed, by, pasternak, s, poor, prospects, and, persuaded, ida, to, refuse, him, she, turned, him, down, and, he, told, of, his, love, and, rejection, in, the, poem, marburg, 1917, i, quivered, i, flared, up, and, then, was, extinguished, i, shook, i, had, made, a, proposal, but, late, too, late, i, was, scared, and, she, had, refused, me, i, pity, her, tears, am, more, blessed, than, a, saint, around, this, time, when, he, was, back, in, russia, he, joined, the, russian, futurist, group, centrifuge, tsentrifuga, as, a, pianist, poetry, was, just, a, hobby, for, him, then, it, was, in, their, group, journal, lirika, where, some, of, his, earliest, poems, were, published, his, involvement, with, the, futurist, movement, as, a, whole, reached, its, peak, when, in, 1914, he, published, a, satirical, article, in, rukonog, which, attacked, the, jealous, leader, of, the, mezzanine, of, poetry, vadim, shershenevich, who, was, criticizing, lirika, and, the, ego, futurists, because, shershenevich, himself, was, barred, from, collaborating, with, centrifuge, the, reason, being, that, he, was, such, a, talentless, poet, the, action, eventually, caused, a, verbal, battle, amongst, several, members, of, the, groups, fighting, for, recognition, as, the, first, truest, russian, futurists, these, included, the, cubo, futurists, who, were, by, that, time, already, notorious, for, their, scandalous, behaviour, pasternak, s, first, and, second, books, of, poetry, were, published, shortly, after, these, events, another, failed, love, affair, in, 1917, inspired, the, poems, in, his, third, and, first, major, book, my, sister, life, his, early, verse, cleverly, dissimulates, his, preoccupation, with, immanuel, kant, s, philosophy, its, fabric, includes, striking, alliterations, wild, rhythmic, combinations, day, to, day, vocabulary, and, hidden, allusions, to, his, favourite, poets, such, as, rilke, lermontov, pushkin, and, german, language, romantic, poets, during, world, war, i, pasternak, taught, and, worked, at, a, chemical, factory, in, vsevolodo, vilva, near, perm, which, undoubtedly, provided, him, with, material, for, dr, zhivago, many, years, later, unlike, the, rest, of, his, family, and, many, of, his, closest, friends, pasternak, chose, not, to, leave, russia, after, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, according, to, max, hayward, pasternak, remained, in, moscow, throughout, the, civil, war, 1918, 1920, making, no, attempt, to, escape, abroad, or, to, the, white, occupied, south, as, a, number, of, other, russian, writers, did, at, the, time, no, doubt, like, yuri, zhivago, he, was, momentarily, impressed, by, the, splendid, surgery, of, the, bolshevik, seizure, of, power, in, october, 1917, but, again, to, judge, by, the, evidence, of, the, novel, and, despite, a, personal, admiration, for, vladimir, lenin, whom, he, saw, at, the, 9th, congress, of, soviets, in, 1921, he, soon, began, to, harbor, profound, doubts, about, the, claims, and, credentials, of, the, regime, not, to, mention, its, style, of, rule, the, terrible, shortages, of, food, and, fuel, and, the, depredations, of, the, red, terror, made, life, very, precarious, in, those, years, particularly, for, the, bourgeois, intelligentsia, in, a, letter, written, to, pasternak, from, abroad, in, the, twenties, marina, tsvetayeva, reminded, him, of, how, she, had, run, into, him, in, the, street, in, 1919, as, he, was, on, the, way, to, sell, some, valuable, books, from, his, library, in, order, to, buy, bread, he, continued, to, write, original, work, and, to, translate, but, after, about, the, middle, of, 1918, it, became, almost, impossible, to, publish, the, only, way, to, make, one, s, work, known, was, to, declaim, it, in, the, several, literary, cafes, which, then, sprang, up, or, anticipating, samizdat, to, circulate, it, in, manuscript, it, was, in, this, way, that, my, sister, life, first, became, available, to, a, wider, audience, when, it, finally, was, published, in, 1922, pasternak, s, my, sister, life, revolutionised, russian, poetry, it, made, pasternak, the, model, for, younger, poets, and, decisively, changed, the, poetry, of, osip, mandelshtam, marina, tsvetayeva, and, others, following, my, sister, life, pasternak, produced, some, hermetic, pieces, of, uneven, quality, including, his, masterpiece, the, lyric, cycle, rupture, 1921, both, pro, soviet, writers, and, their, white, migr, equivalents, applauded, pasternak, s, poetry, as, pure, unbridled, inspiration, in, the, late, 1920s, he, also, participated, in, the, much, celebrated, tripartite, correspondence, with, rilke, and, tsvetayeva, as, the, 1920s, wore, on, however, pasternak, increasingly, felt, that, his, colourful, style, was, at, odds, with, a, less, educated, readership, he, attempted, to, make, his, poetry, more, comprehensible, by, reworking, his, earlier, pieces, and, starting, two, lengthy, poems, on, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, he, also, turned, to, prose, and, wrote, several, autobiographical, stories, notably, the, childhood, of, luvers, and, safe, conduct, the, collection, zhenia, s, childhood, and, other, stories, would, be, published, in, 1982, in, 1922, pasternak, married, evgeniya, lurye, a, student, at, the, art, institute, the, following, year, their, son, yevgeny, was, born, evidence, of, pasternak, s, support, of, still, revolutionary, members, of, the, leadership, of, the, communist, party, as, late, as, 1926, is, indicated, by, his, poem, in, memory, of, reissner, presumably, written, upon, the, premature, death, from, typhus, of, bolshevik, leader, larisa, reisner, aged, 30, in, february, of, that, year, by, 1927, pasternak, s, close, friends, vladimir, mayakovsky, and, nikolai, aseyev, were, advocating, the, complete, subordination, of, the, arts, to, the, needs, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, josephine, pasternak, wrote, of, his, intentions, to, break, off, relations, with, both, of, them, although, he, expressed, that, it, would, be, deeply, painful, pasternak, explained, that, it, could, not, be, prevented, he, explained, they, don, t, in, any, way, measure, up, to, their, exalted, calling, in, fact, they, ve, fallen, short, of, it, but, difficult, as, it, is, for, me, to, understand, a, modern, sophist, might, say, that, these, last, years, have, actually, demanded, a, reduction, in, conscience, and, feeling, in, the, name, of, greater, intelligibility, yet, now, the, very, spirit, of, the, times, demands, great, courageous, purity, and, these, men, are, ruled, by, trivial, routine, subjectively, they, re, sincere, and, conscientious, but, i, find, it, increasingly, difficult, to, take, into, account, the, personal, aspect, of, their, convictions, i, m, not, out, on, my, own, people, treat, me, well, but, all, that, only, holds, good, up, to, a, point, it, seems, to, me, that, i, ve, reached, that, point, by, 1932, pasternak, had, strikingly, reshaped, his, style, to, make, it, more, understandable, to, the, general, public, and, printed, the, new, collection, of, poems, aptly, titled, the, second, birth, although, its, caucasian, pieces, were, as, brilliant, as, the, earlier, efforts, the, book, alienated, the, core, of, pasternak, s, refined, audience, abroad, which, was, largely, composed, of, anti, communist, migr, s, in, 1932, pasternak, fell, in, love, with, zinaida, neuhaus, the, wife, of, the, russian, pianist, heinrich, neuhaus, they, both, got, divorces, and, married, two, years, later, pasternak, continued, to, change, his, poetry, simplifying, his, style, and, language, through, the, years, as, expressed, in, his, next, book, early, trains, 1943, in, april, 1934, osip, mandelstam, recited, his, stalin, epigram, to, pasternak, after, listening, pasternak, told, mandelstam, i, didn, t, hear, this, you, didn, t, recite, it, to, me, because, you, know, very, strange, and, terrible, things, are, happening, now, they, ve, begun, to, pick, people, up, i, m, afraid, the, walls, have, ears, and, perhaps, even, these, benches, on, the, boulevard, here, may, be, able, to, listen, and, tell, tales, so, let, s, make, out, that, i, heard, nothing, on, the, night, of, 14, may, 1934, mandelstam, was, arrested, at, his, home, based, on, a, warrant, signed, by, nkvd, boss, genrikh, yagoda, devastated, pasternak, went, immediately, to, the, offices, of, izvestia, and, begged, nikolai, bukharin, to, intercede, on, mandelstam, s, behalf, soon, after, his, meeting, with, bukharin, the, telephone, rang, in, pasternak, s, moscow, apartment, a, voice, from, the, kremlin, said, comrade, stalin, wishes, to, speak, with, you, according, to, ivinskaya, pasternak, was, struck, dumb, he, was, totally, unprepared, for, such, a, conversation, but, then, he, heard, his, voice, the, voice, of, stalin, coming, over, the, line, the, leader, addressed, him, in, a, rather, bluff, uncouth, fashion, using, the, familiar, thou, form, tell, me, what, are, they, saying, in, your, literary, circles, about, the, arrest, of, mandelstam, flustered, pasternak, denied, that, there, was, any, discussion, or, that, there, were, any, literary, circles, left, in, soviet, russia, stalin, went, on, to, ask, him, for, his, own, opinion, of, mandelstam, in, an, eager, fumbling, manner, pasternak, explained, that, he, and, mandelstam, each, had, a, completely, different, philosophy, about, poetry, stalin, finally, said, in, a, mocking, tone, of, voice, i, see, you, just, aren, t, able, to, stick, up, for, a, comrade, and, put, down, the, receiver, according, to, pasternak, during, the, 1937, show, trial, of, general, iona, yakir, and, marshal, mikhail, tukhachevsky, the, union, of, soviet, writers, requested, all, members, to, add, their, names, to, a, statement, supporting, the, death, penalty, for, the, defendants, pasternak, refused, to, sign, even, after, leadership, of, the, union, visited, and, threatened, him, soon, after, pasternak, appealed, directly, to, stalin, describing, his, family, s, strong, tolstoyan, convictions, and, putting, his, own, life, at, stalin, s, disposal, he, said, that, he, could, not, stand, as, a, self, appointed, judge, of, life, and, death, pasternak, was, certain, that, he, would, be, arrested, but, instead, stalin, is, said, to, have, crossed, pasternak, s, name, off, an, execution, list, reportedly, declaring, do, not, touch, this, cloud, dweller, or, in, another, version, leave, that, holy, fool, alone, pasternak, s, close, friend, titsian, tabidze, did, fall, victim, to, the, great, purge, in, an, autobiographical, essay, published, in, the, 1950s, pasternak, described, the, execution, of, tabidze, and, the, suicides, of, marina, tsvetaeva, and, paolo, iashvili, ivinskaya, wrote, i, believe, that, between, stalin, and, pasternak, there, was, an, incredible, silent, duel, when, the, luftwaffe, began, bombing, moscow, pasternak, immediately, began, to, serve, as, a, fire, warden, on, the, roof, of, the, writer, s, building, on, lavrushinski, street, according, to, ivinskaya, he, repeatedly, helped, to, dispose, of, german, bombs, which, fell, on, it, in, 1943, pasternak, was, finally, granted, permission, to, visit, the, soldiers, at, the, front, he, bore, it, well, considering, the, hardships, of, the, journey, he, had, a, weak, leg, from, an, old, injury, and, he, wanted, to, go, to, the, most, dangerous, places, he, read, his, poetry, and, talked, extensively, with, the, active, and, injured, troops, pasternak, later, said, if, in, a, bad, dream, we, had, seen, all, the, horrors, in, store, for, us, after, the, war, we, should, not, have, been, sorry, to, see, stalin, fall, together, with, hitler, then, an, end, to, the, war, in, favour, of, our, allies, civilized, countries, with, democratic, traditions, would, have, meant, a, hundred, times, less, suffering, for, our, people, than, that, which, stalin, again, inflicted, on, it, after, his, victory, in, october, 1946, the, twice, married, pasternak, met, olga, ivinskaya, a, 34, year, old, single, mother, employed, by, novy, mir, deeply, moved, by, her, resemblance, to, his, first, love, ida, vysotskaya, pasternak, gave, ivinskaya, several, volumes, of, his, poetry, and, literary, translations, although, pasternak, never, left, his, wife, zinaida, he, started, an, extramarital, relationship, with, ivinskaya, that, would, last, for, the, remainder, of, pasternak, s, life, ivinskaya, later, recalled, he, phoned, almost, every, day, and, instinctively, fearing, to, meet, or, talk, with, him, yet, dying, of, happiness, i, would, stammer, out, that, i, was, busy, today, but, almost, every, afternoon, toward, the, end, of, working, hours, he, came, in, person, to, the, office, and, often, walked, with, me, through, the, streets, boulevards, and, squares, all, the, way, home, to, potapov, street, shall, i, make, you, a, present, of, this, square, he, would, ask, she, gave, him, the, phone, number, of, her, neighbour, olga, volkova, who, resided, below, in, the, evenings, pasternak, would, phone, and, volkova, would, signal, by, olga, banging, on, the, water, pipe, which, connected, their, apartments, when, they, first, met, pasternak, was, translating, the, verse, of, the, hungarian, national, poet, s, ndor, pet, fi, pasternak, gave, his, lover, a, book, of, pet, fi, with, the, inscription, pet, fi, served, as, a, code, in, may, and, june, 1947, and, my, close, translations, of, his, lyrics, are, an, expression, adapted, to, the, requirements, of, the, text, of, my, feelings, and, thoughts, for, you, and, about, you, in, memory, of, it, all, b, p, 13, may, 1948, pasternak, later, noted, on, a, photograph, of, himself, pet, fi, is, magnificent, with, his, descriptive, lyrics, and, picture, of, nature, but, you, are, better, still, i, worked, on, him, a, good, deal, in, 1947, and, 1948, when, i, first, came, to, know, you, thank, you, for, your, help, i, was, translating, both, of, you, ivinskaya, would, later, describe, the, pet, fi, translations, as, a, first, declaration, of, love, according, to, ivinskaya, zinaida, pasternak, was, infuriated, by, her, husband, s, infidelity, once, when, his, younger, son, leonid, fell, seriously, ill, zinaida, extracted, a, promise, from, her, husband, as, they, stood, by, the, boy, s, sickbed, that, he, would, end, his, affair, with, ivinskaya, pasternak, asked, luisa, popova, a, mutual, friend, to, tell, ivinskaya, about, his, promise, popova, told, him, that, he, must, do, it, himself, soon, after, ivinskaya, happened, to, be, ill, at, popova, s, apartment, when, suddenly, zinaida, pasternak, arrived, and, confronted, her, ivinskaya, later, recalled, but, i, became, so, ill, through, loss, of, blood, that, she, and, luisa, had, to, get, me, to, the, hospital, and, i, no, longer, remember, exactly, what, passed, between, me, and, this, heavily, built, strong, minded, woman, who, kept, repeating, how, she, didn, t, give, a, damn, for, our, love, and, that, although, she, no, longer, loved, herself, she, would, not, allow, her, family, to, be, broken, up, after, my, return, from, the, hospital, boris, came, to, visit, me, as, though, nothing, had, happened, and, touchingly, made, his, peace, with, my, mother, telling, her, how, much, he, loved, me, by, now, she, was, pretty, well, used, to, these, funny, ways, of, his, in, 1948, pasternak, advised, ivinskaya, to, resign, her, job, at, novy, mir, which, was, becoming, extremely, difficult, due, to, their, relationship, in, the, aftermath, pasternak, began, to, instruct, her, in, translating, poetry, in, time, they, began, to, refer, to, her, apartment, on, potapov, street, as, our, shop, on, the, evening, of, 6, october, 1949, ivinskaya, was, arrested, at, her, apartment, by, the, kgb, ivinskaya, relates, in, her, memoirs, that, when, the, agents, burst, into, her, apartment, she, was, at, her, typewriter, working, on, translations, of, the, korean, poet, won, tu, son, her, apartment, was, ransacked, and, all, items, connected, with, pasternak, were, piled, up, in, her, presence, ivinskaya, was, taken, to, the, lubyanka, prison, and, repeatedly, interrogated, where, she, refused, to, say, anything, incriminating, about, pasternak, at, the, time, she, was, pregnant, with, pasternak, s, child, and, had, a, miscarriage, early, in, her, ten, year, sentence, in, the, gulag, upon, learning, of, his, mistress, arrest, pasternak, telephoned, liuisa, popova, and, asked, her, to, come, at, once, to, gogol, boulevard, she, found, him, sitting, on, a, bench, near, the, palace, of, soviets, metro, station, weeping, pasternak, told, her, everything, is, finished, now, they, ve, taken, her, away, from, me, and, i, ll, never, see, her, again, it, s, like, death, even, worse, according, to, ivinskaya, after, this, in, conversation, with, people, he, scarcely, knew, he, always, referred, to, stalin, as, a, murderer, talking, with, people, in, the, offices, of, literary, periodicals, he, often, asked, when, will, there, be, an, end, to, this, freedom, for, lackeys, who, happily, walk, over, corpses, to, further, their, own, interests, he, spent, a, good, deal, of, time, with, akhmatova, who, in, those, years, was, given, a, very, wide, berth, by, most, of, the, people, who, knew, her, he, worked, intensively, on, the, second, part, of, doctor, zhivago, in, a, 1958, letter, to, a, friend, in, west, germany, pasternak, wrote, she, was, put, in, jail, on, my, account, as, the, person, considered, by, the, secret, police, to, be, closest, to, me, and, they, hoped, that, by, means, of, a, gruelling, interrogation, and, threats, they, could, extract, enough, evidence, from, her, to, put, me, on, trial, i, owe, my, life, and, the, fact, that, they, did, not, touch, me, in, those, years, to, her, heroism, and, endurance, pasternak, s, translation, of, the, first, part, of, faust, led, him, to, be, attacked, in, the, august, 1950, edition, of, novy, mir, the, critic, accused, pasternak, of, distorting, goethe, s, progressive, meanings, to, support, the, reactionary, theory, of, pure, art, as, well, as, introducing, aesthetic, and, individualist, values, in, a, subsequent, letter, to, the, daughter, of, marina, tsvetaeva, pasternak, explained, that, the, attack, was, motivated, by, the, fact, that, the, supernatural, elements, of, the, play, which, novy, mir, considered, irrational, had, been, translated, as, goethe, had, written, them, pasternak, further, declared, that, despite, the, attacks, on, his, translation, his, contract, for, the, second, part, had, not, been, revoked, when, stalin, died, of, a, stroke, on, 5, march, 1953, ivinskaya, was, still, imprisoned, in, the, gulag, and, pasternak, was, in, moscow, across, the, nation, there, were, waves, of, panic, confusion, and, public, displays, of, grief, pasternak, wrote, men, who, are, not, free, always, idealize, their, bondage, after, her, release, pasternak, s, relationship, with, ivinskaya, picked, up, where, it, had, left, off, soon, after, he, confided, in, her, for, so, long, we, were, ruled, over, by, a, madman, and, a, murderer, and, now, by, a, fool, and, a, pig, the, madman, had, his, occasional, flights, of, fancy, he, had, an, intuitive, feeling, for, certain, things, despite, his, wild, obscurantism, now, we, are, ruled, over, by, mediocrities, during, this, period, pasternak, delighted, in, reading, a, clandestine, copy, of, george, orwell, s, animal, farm, in, english, in, conversation, with, ivinskaya, pasternak, explained, that, the, pig, dictator, napoleon, in, the, novel, vividly, reminded, him, of, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, although, it, contains, passages, written, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, doctor, zhivago, was, not, completed, until, 1955, pasternak, submitted, the, novel, to, novy, mir, in, 1956, which, refused, publication, due, to, its, rejection, of, socialist, realism, the, author, like, his, protagonist, yuri, zhivago, showed, more, concern, for, the, welfare, of, individual, characters, than, for, the, progress, of, society, censors, also, regarded, some, passages, as, anti, soviet, especially, the, novel, s, criticisms, of, stalinism, collectivisation, the, great, purge, and, the, gulag, pasternak, s, fortunes, were, soon, to, change, however, in, march, 1956, the, italian, communist, party, sent, a, journalist, sergio, d, angelo, to, work, in, the, soviet, union, and, his, status, as, a, journalist, as, well, as, his, membership, in, the, italian, communist, party, allowed, him, to, have, access, to, various, aspects, of, the, cultural, life, in, moscow, at, the, time, a, milan, publisher, the, communist, giangiacomo, feltrinelli, had, also, given, him, a, commission, to, find, new, works, of, soviet, literature, that, would, be, appealing, to, western, audiences, and, upon, learning, of, doctor, zhivago, s, existence, d, angelo, travelled, immediately, to, peredelkino, and, offered, to, submit, pasternak, s, novel, to, feltrinelli, s, company, for, publication, at, first, pasternak, was, stunned, then, he, brought, the, manuscript, from, his, study, and, told, d, angelo, with, a, laugh, you, are, hereby, invited, to, watch, me, face, the, firing, squad, according, to, lazar, fleishman, pasternak, was, aware, that, he, was, taking, a, huge, risk, no, soviet, author, had, attempted, to, deal, with, western, publishers, since, the, 1920s, when, such, behavior, led, the, soviet, state, to, declare, war, on, boris, pilnyak, and, evgeny, zamyatin, pasternak, however, believed, that, feltrinelli, s, communist, affiliation, would, not, only, guarantee, publication, but, might, even, force, the, soviet, state, to, publish, the, novel, in, russia, in, a, rare, moment, of, agreement, both, olga, ivinskaya, and, zinaida, pasternak, were, horrified, by, the, submission, of, doctor, zhivago, to, a, western, publishing, house, pasternak, however, refused, to, change, his, mind, and, informed, an, emissary, from, feltrinelli, that, he, was, prepared, to, undergo, any, sacrifice, in, order, to, see, doctor, zhivago, published, in, 1957, feltrinelli, announced, that, the, novel, would, be, published, by, his, company, despite, repeated, demands, from, visiting, soviet, emissaries, feltrinelli, refused, to, cancel, or, delay, publication, according, to, ivinskaya, he, did, not, believe, that, we, would, ever, publish, the, manuscript, here, and, felt, he, had, no, right, to, withhold, a, masterpiece, from, the, world, this, would, be, an, even, greater, crime, the, soviet, government, forced, pasternak, to, cable, the, publisher, to, withdraw, the, manuscript, but, he, sent, separate, secret, letters, advising, feltrinelli, to, ignore, the, telegrams, helped, considerably, by, the, soviet, campaign, against, the, novel, as, well, as, by, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, s, secret, purchase, of, hundreds, of, copies, of, the, book, as, it, came, off, the, presses, around, the, world, see, nobel, prize, section, below, doctor, zhivago, became, an, instant, sensation, throughout, the, non, communist, world, upon, its, release, in, november, 1957, in, the, state, of, israel, however, pasternak, s, novel, was, sharply, criticized, for, its, assimilationist, views, towards, the, jewish, people, when, informed, of, this, pasternak, responded, no, matter, i, am, above, race, according, to, lazar, fleishman, pasternak, had, written, the, disputed, passages, prior, to, israeli, independence, at, the, time, pasternak, had, also, been, regularly, attending, russian, orthodox, divine, liturgy, therefore, he, believed, that, soviet, jews, converting, to, christianity, was, preferable, to, assimilating, into, atheism, and, stalinism, the, first, english, translation, of, doctor, zhivago, was, hastily, produced, by, max, hayward, and, manya, harari, in, order, to, coincide, with, overwhelming, public, demand, it, was, released, in, august, 1958, and, remained, the, only, edition, available, for, more, than, fifty, years, between, 1958, and, 1959, the, english, language, edition, spent, 26, weeks, at, the, top, of, the, new, york, times, bestseller, list, ivinskaya, s, daughter, irina, circulated, typed, copies, of, the, novel, in, samizdat, although, no, soviet, critics, had, read, the, banned, novel, doctor, zhivago, was, pilloried, in, the, state, owned, press, similar, attacks, led, to, a, humorous, russian, saying, i, haven, t, read, pasternak, but, i, condemn, him, during, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, pasternak, had, composed, a, series, of, poems, on, gospel, themes, according, to, ivinskaya, pasternak, had, regarded, stalin, as, a, giant, of, the, pre, christian, era, therefore, pasternak, s, decision, to, write, christian, poetry, was, a, form, of, protest, on, 9, september, 1958, the, literary, gazette, critic, viktor, pertsov, retaliated, by, denouncing, the, decadent, religious, poetry, of, pasternak, which, reeks, of, mothballs, from, the, symbolist, suitcase, of, 1908, 10, manufacture, furthermore, the, author, received, much, hate, mail, from, communists, both, at, home, and, abroad, according, to, ivinskaya, pasternak, continued, to, receive, such, letters, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, a, letter, written, to, his, sister, josephine, however, pasternak, recalled, the, words, of, his, friend, ekaterina, krashennikova, upon, reading, doctor, zhivago, she, had, said, don, t, forget, yourself, to, the, point, of, believing, that, it, was, you, who, wrote, this, work, it, was, the, russian, people, and, their, sufferings, who, created, it, thank, god, for, having, expressed, it, through, your, pen, according, to, yevgeni, borisovich, pasternak, rumors, that, pasternak, was, to, receive, the, nobel, prize, started, right, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, according, to, the, former, nobel, committee, head, lars, gyllensten, his, nomination, was, discussed, every, year, from, 1946, to, 1950, then, again, in, 1957, it, was, finally, awarded, in, 1958, pasternak, guessed, at, this, from, the, growing, waves, of, criticism, in, ussr, sometimes, he, had, to, justify, his, european, fame, according, to, the, union, of, soviet, writers, some, literature, circles, of, the, west, see, unusual, importance, in, my, work, not, matching, its, modesty, and, low, productivity, meanwhile, pasternak, wrote, to, renate, schweitzer, and, his, sister, lydia, pasternak, slater, in, both, letters, the, author, expressed, hope, that, he, would, be, passed, over, by, the, nobel, committee, in, favour, of, alberto,

not, read, the, book, hastily, convened, meetings, of, pasternak, s, friends, and, colleagues, at, which, fine, poets, like, vladimir, soloukin, leonid, martynov, and, boris, slutsky, were, forced, to, censure, an, author, they, respected, slutsky, who, in, his, brutal, prose, like, poems, had, created, an, image, for, himself, as, a, courageous, soldier, and, truth, lover, was, so, tormented,

called, pasternak, a, mangy, sheep, who, pleased, the, enemies, of, the, soviet, union, with, his, slanderous, so, called, work, then, semichastny, who, became, head, of, the, kgb, in, 1961, added, that, this, man, went, and, spat, in, the, face, of, the, people, and, he, concluded, with, if, you, compare, pasternak, to, a, pig, a, pig, would, not, do, what, he, did, because, a, pig, never, shits, where, it, eats, khrushchev, applauded, demonstratively, news, of, that, speech, drove, pasternak, to, the, brink, of, suicide, it, has, recently, come, to, light, that, the, real, author, of, semichastny, s, insults, was, khrushchev, who, had, called, the, komsomol, leader, the, night, before, and, dictated, his, lines, about, the, mangy, sheep, and, the, pig, which, semichastny, described, as, a, typically, khrushchevian, deliberately, crude, unceremoniously, scolding, furthermore, pasternak, was, informed, that, if, he, traveled, to, stockholm, to, collect, his, nobel, medal, he, would, be, refused, re, entry, to, the, soviet, union, as, a, result, on, 29, october, pasternak, sent, a, second, telegram, to, the, nobel, committee, in, view, of, the, meaning, given, the, award, by, the, society, in, which, i, live, i, must, renounce, this, undeserved, distinction, which, has, been, conferred, on, me, please, do, not, take, my, voluntary, renunciation, amiss, the, swedish, academy, announced, this, refusal, of, course, in, no, way, alters, the, validity, of, the, award, there, remains, only, for, the, academy, however, to, announce, with, regret, that, the, presentation, of, the, prize, cannot, take, place, according, to, yevgenii, pasternak, i, couldn, t, recognize, my, father, when, i, saw, him, that, evening, pale, lifeless, face, tired, painful, eyes, and, only, speaking, about, the, same, thing, now, it, all, doesn, t, matter, i, declined, the, prize, despite, his, decision, to, decline, the, award, the, union, of, soviet, writers, continued, to, demonise, pasternak, in, the, state, owned, press, furthermore, he, was, threatened, at, the, very, least, with, formal, exile, to, the, west, in, response, pasternak, wrote, directly, to, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, i, am, addressing, you, personally, the, c, c, of, the, c, p, s, s, and, the, soviet, government, from, comrade, semichastny, s, speech, i, learn, that, the, government, would, not, put, any, obstacles, in, the, way, of, my, departure, from, the, u, s, s, r, for, me, this, is, impossible, i, am, tied, to, russia, by, birth, by, my, life, and, work, i, cannot, conceive, of, my, destiny, separate, from, russia, or, outside, it, whatever, my, mistakes, or, failings, i, could, not, imagine, that, i, should, find, myself, at, the, center, of, such, a, political, campaign, as, has, been, worked, up, round, my, name, in, the, west, once, i, was, aware, of, this, i, informed, the, swedish, academy, of, my, voluntary, renunciation, of, the, nobel, prize, departure, beyond, the, borders, of, my, country, would, for, me, be, tantamount, to, death, and, i, therefore, request, you, not, to, take, this, extreme, measure, with, me, with, my, hand, on, my, heart, i, can, say, that, i, have, done, something, for, soviet, literature, and, may, still, be, of, use, to, it, in, the, oak, and, the, calf, alexander, solzhenitsyn, sharply, criticized, pasternak, both, for, declining, the, nobel, prize, and, for, sending, such, a, letter, to, khrushchev, in, her, own, memoirs, olga, ivinskaya, blames, herself, for, pressuring, her, lover, into, making, both, decisions, according, to, yevgenii, pasternak, she, accused, herself, bitterly, for, persuading, pasternak, to, decline, the, prize, after, all, that, had, happened, open, shadowing, friends, turning, away, pasternak, s, suicidal, condition, at, the, time, one, can, understand, her, the, memory, of, stalin, s, camps, was, too, fresh, she, tried, to, protect, him, on, 31, october, 1958, the, union, of, soviet, writers, held, a, trial, behind, closed, doors, according, to, the, meeting, minutes, pasternak, was, denounced, as, an, internal, migr, and, a, fascist, fifth, columnist, afterwards, the, attendees, announced, that, pasternak, had, been, expelled, from, the, union, they, further, signed, a, petition, to, the, politburo, demanding, that, pasternak, be, stripped, of, his, soviet, citizenship, and, exiled, to, his, capitalist, paradise, according, to, yevgenii, pasternak, however, author, konstantin, paustovsky, refused, to, attend, the, meeting, yevgeny, yevtushenko, did, attend, but, walked, out, in, disgust, according, to, yevgenii, pasternak, his, father, would, have, been, exiled, had, it, not, been, for, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, who, telephoned, khrushchev, and, threatened, to, organize, a, committee, for, pasternak, s, protection, it, is, possible, that, the, 1958, nobel, prize, prevented, pasternak, s, imprisonment, due, to, the, soviet, state, s, fear, of, international, protests, yevgenii, pasternak, believes, however, that, the, resulting, persecution, fatally, weakened, his, father, s, health, meanwhile, bill, mauldin, produced, a, cartoon, about, pasternak, that, won, the, 1959, pulitzer, prize, for, editorial, cartooning, the, cartoon, depicts, pasternak, as, a, gulag, inmate, splitting, trees, in, the, snow, saying, to, another, inmate, i, won, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, what, was, your, crime, pasternak, s, post, zhivago, poetry, probes, the, universal, questions, of, love, immortality, and, reconciliation, with, god, boris, pasternak, wrote, his, last, complete, book, when, the, weather, clears, in, 1959, according, to, ivinskaya, pasternak, continued, to, stick, to, his, daily, writing, schedule, even, during, the, controversy, over, doctor, zhivago, he, also, continued, translating, the, writings, of, juliusz, s, owacki, and, pedro, calder, n, de, la, barca, in, his, work, on, calderon, pasternak, received, the, discreet, support, of, nikolai, mikhailovich, liubimov, a, senior, figure, in, the, party, s, literary, apparatus, ivinskaya, describes, liubimov, as, a, shrewd, and, enlightened, person, who, understood, very, well, that, all, the, mudslinging, and, commotion, over, the, novel, would, be, forgotten, but, that, there, would, always, be, a, pasternak, in, a, letter, to, his, sisters, in, oxford, england, pasternak, claimed, to, have, finished, translating, one, of, calderon, s, plays, in, less, than, a, week, during, the, summer, of, 1959, pasternak, began, writing, the, blind, beauty, a, trilogy, of, stage, plays, set, before, and, after, alexander, ii, s, abolition, of, serfdom, in, russia, in, an, interview, with, olga, carlisle, from, the, paris, review, pasternak, enthusiastically, described, the, play, s, plot, and, characters, he, informed, olga, carlisle, that, at, the, end, of, the, blind, beauty, he, wished, to, depict, the, birth, of, an, enlightened, and, affluent, middle, class, open, to, occidental, influences, progressive, intelligent, artistic, however, pasternak, fell, ill, with, terminal, lung, cancer, before, he, could, complete, the, first, play, of, the, trilogy, boris, pasternak, died, of, lung, cancer, in, his, dacha, in, peredelkino, on, the, evening, of, 30, may, 1960, he, first, summoned, his, sons, and, in, their, presence, said, who, will, suffer, most, because, of, my, death, who, will, suffer, most, only, oliusha, will, and, i, haven, t, had, time, to, do, anything, for, her, the, worst, thing, is, that, she, will, suffer, pasternak, s, last, words, were, i, can, t, hear, very, well, and, there, s, a, mist, in, front, of, my, eyes, but, it, will, go, away, won, t, it, don, t, forget, to, open, the, window, tomorrow, despite, only, a, small, notice, appearing, in, the, literary, gazette, handwritten, notices, carrying, the, date, and, time, of, the, funeral, were, posted, throughout, the, moscow, subway, system, as, a, result, thousands, of, admirers, braved, militia, and, kgb, surveillance, to, attend, pasternak, s, funeral, in, peredelkino, before, pasternak, s, civil, funeral, ivinskaya, had, a, conversation, with, konstantin, paustovsky, according, to, her, he, began, to, say, what, an, authentic, event, the, funeral, was, an, expression, of, what, people, really, felt, and, so, characteristic, of, the, russia, which, stoned, its, prophets, and, did, its, poets, to, death, as, a, matter, of, longstanding, tradition, at, such, a, moment, he, continued, indignantly, one, was, bound, to, recall, the, funeral, of, pushkin, and, the, tsar, s, courtiers, their, miserable, hypocrisy, and, false, pride, just, think, how, rich, they, are, how, many, pasternaks, they, have, as, many, as, there, were, pushkins, in, the, russia, of, tsar, nicholas, not, much, has, changed, but, what, can, one, expect, they, are, afraid, then, in, the, presence, of, a, large, number, of, foreign, journalists, the, body, of, pasternak, was, removed, to, the, cemetery, according, to, ivinskaya, the, graveside, service, now, began, it, was, hard, for, me, in, my, state, to, make, out, what, was, going, on, later, i, was, told, that, paustovski, had, wanted, to, give, the, funeral, address, but, it, was, in, fact, professor, asmus, who, spoke, wearing, a, light, colored, suit, and, a, bright, tie, he, was, dressed, more, for, some, gala, occasion, than, for, a, funeral, a, writer, has, died, he, began, who, together, with, pushkin, dostoevsky, and, tolstoy, forms, part, of, the, glory, of, russian, literature, even, if, we, cannot, agree, with, him, in, everything, we, all, none, the, less, owe, him, a, debt, of, gratitude, for, setting, an, example, of, unswerving, honesty, for, his, incorruptible, conscience, and, for, his, heroic, view, of, his, duty, as, a, writer, needless, to, say, he, mentioned, s, mistakes, and, failings, but, hastened, to, add, that, they, do, not, however, prevent, us, from, recognizing, the, fact, that, he, was, a, great, poet, he, was, a, very, modest, man, asmus, said, in, conclusion, and, he, did, not, like, people, to, talk, about, him, too, much, so, with, this, i, shall, bring, my, address, to, a, close, to, the, horror, of, the, assembled, party, officials, however, someone, with, a, young, and, deeply, anguished, voice, began, reciting, pasternak, s, banned, poem, hamlet, a, the, murmurs, ebb, onto, the, stage, i, enter, i, am, trying, standing, at, the, door, to, discover, in, the, distant, echoes, what, the, coming, years, may, hold, in, store, the, nocturnal, darkness, with, a, thousand, binoculars, is, focused, onto, me, take, away, this, cup, o, abba,

pasternak, the, all, powerful, god, of, detail, always, it, seems, revolted, against, the, idea, of, turning, out, verse, for, its, own, sake, or, to, convey, vague, personal, moods, if, eternal, themes, were, to, be, dealt, with, yet, again, then, only, by, a, poet, in, the, true, sense, of, the, word, otherwise, he, should, not, have, the, strength, of, character, to, touch, them, at, all, poetry, so, tightly, packed, till, it, crunched, like, ice, or, distilled, into, a, solution, where, grains, of, true, prose, germinated, a, poetry, in, which, realistic, detail, cast, a, genuine, spell, only, such, poetry, was, acceptable, to, pasternak, but, not, poetry, for, which, indulgence, was, required, or, for, which, allowances, had, to, be, made, that, is, the, kind, of, ephemeral, poetry, which, is, particularly, common, in, an, age, of, literary, conformism, could, weep, over, the, purple, gray, circle, which, glowed, above, blok, s, tormented, muse, and, he, never, failed, to, be, moved, by, the, terseness, of, pushkin, s, sprightly, lines, but, rhymed, slogans, about, the, production, of, tin, cans, in, the, so, called, poetry, of, surkov, and, his, like, as, well, as, the, outpourings, about, love, in, the, work, of, those, young, poets, who, only, echo, each, other, and, the, classics, all, this, left, him, cold, at, best, and, for, the, most, part, made, him, indignant, for, this, reason, pasternak, regularly, avoided, literary, cafes, where, young, poets, regularly, invited, them, to, read, their, verse, according, to, ivinskaya, it, was, this, sort, of, thing, that, moved, him, to, say, who, started, the, idea, that, i, love, poetry, i, can, t, stand, poetry, also, according, to, ivinskaya, the, way, they, could, write, he, once, exclaimed, by, they, he, meant, the, russian, classics, and, immediately, afterward, reading, or, rather, glancing, through, some, verse, in, the, literary, gazette, just, look, how, tremendously, well, they, ve, learned, to, rhyme, but, there, s, actually, nothing, there, it, would, be, better, to, say, it, in, a, news, bulletin, what, has, poetry, got, to, do, with, this, by, they, in, this, case, he, meant, the, poets, writing, today, reluctant, to, conform, to, socialist, realism, pasternak, turned, to, translation, in, order, to, provide, for, his, family, he, soon, produced, acclaimed, translations, of, s, ndor, pet, fi, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, rainer, maria, rilke, paul, verlaine, taras, shevchenko, and, nikoloz, baratashvili, osip, mandelstam, however, privately, warned, him, your, collected, works, will, consist, of, twelve, volumes, of, translations, and, only, one, of, your, own, work, in, a, 1942, letter, pasternak, declared, i, am, completely, opposed, to, contemporary, ideas, about, translation, the, work, of, lozinski, radlova, marshak, and, chukovski, is, alien, to, me, and, seems, artificial, soulless, and, lacking, in, depth, i, share, the, nineteenth, century, view, of, translation, as, a, literary, exercise, demanding, insight, of, a, higher, kind, than, that, provided, by, a, merely, philological, approach, according, to, ivinskaya, pasternak, believed, in, not, being, too, literal, in, his, translations, which, he, felt, could, confuse, the, meaning, of, the, text, he, instead, advocated, observing, each, poem, from, afar, to, plumb, its, true, depths, pasternak, s, translations, of, william, shakespeare, romeo, and, juliet, antony, and, cleopatra, othello, king, henry, iv, part, i, and, part, ii, hamlet, macbeth, king, lear, remain, deeply, popular, with, russian, audiences, because, of, their, colloquial, modernised, dialogues, pasternak, s, critics, however, accused, him, of, pasternakizing, shakespeare, in, a, 1956, essay, pasternak, wrote, translating, shakespeare, is, a, task, which, takes, time, and, effort, once, it, is, undertaken, it, is, best, to, divide, it, into, sections, long, enough, for, the, work, to, not, get, stale, and, to, complete, one, section, each, day, in, thus, daily, progressing, through, the, text, the, translator, finds, himself, reliving, the, circumstances, of, the, author, day, by, day, he, reproduces, his, actions, and, he, is, drawn, into, some, of, his, secrets, not, in, theory, but, practically, by, experience, according, to, ivinskaya, whenever, was, provided, with, literal, versions, of, things, which, echoed, his, own, thoughts, or, feelings, it, made, all, the, difference, and, he, worked, feverishly, turning, them, into, masterpieces, i, remember, his, translating, paul, verlaine, in, a, burst, of, enthusiasm, like, this, art, po, tique, verlaine, was, after, all, an, expression, of, his, own, beliefs, about, poetry, while, they, were, both, collaborating, on, translating, rabindranath, tagore, from, bengali, into, russian, pasternak, advised, ivinskaya, 1, bring, out, the, theme, of, the, poem, its, subject, matter, as, clearly, as, possible, 2, tighten, up, the, fluid, non, european, form, by, rhyming, internally, not, at, the, end, of, the, lines, 3, use, loose, irregular, meters, mostly, ternary, ones, you, may, allow, yourself, to, use, assonances, later, while, she, was, collaborating, with, him, on, a, translation, of, v, t, zslav, nezval, pasternak, told, ivinskaya, use, the, literal, translation, only, for, the, meaning, but, do, not, borrow, words, as, they, stand, from, it, they, are, absurd, and, not, always, comprehensible, don, t, translate, everything, only, what, you, can, manage, and, by, this, means, try, to, make, the, translation, more, precise, than, the, original, an, absolute, necessity, in, the, case, of, such, a, confused, slipshod, piece, of, work, according, to, ivinskaya, however, translation, was, not, a, genuine, vocation, for, pasternak, she, later, recalled, one, day, someone, brought, him, a, copy, of, a, british, newspaper, in, which, there, was, a, double, feature, under, the, title, pasternak, keeps, a, courageous, silence, it, said, that, if, shakespeare, had, written, in, russian, he, would, have, written, in, the, same, way, he, was, translated, by, pasternak, what, a, pity, the, article, continued, that, pasternak, published, nothing, but, translations, writing, his, own, work, for, himself, and, a, small, circle, of, intimate, friends, what, do, they, mean, by, saying, that, my, silence, is, courageous, commented, sadly, after, reading, all, this, i, am, silent, because, i, am, not, printed, boris, pasternak, was, also, a, composer, and, had, a, promising, musical, career, as, a, musician, ahead, of, him, had, he, chosen, to, pursue, it, he, came, from, a, musical, family, his, mother, was, a, concert, pianist, and, a, student, of, anton, rubinstein, and, theodor, leschetizky, and, pasternak, s, early, impressions, were, of, hearing, piano, trios, in, the, home, the, family, had, a, dacha, country, house, close, to, one, occupied, by, alexander, scriabin, sergei, rachmaninoff, rainer, maria, rilke, and, leo, tolstoy, were, all, visitors, to, the, family, home, his, father, leonid, was, a, painter, who, produced, one, of, the, most, important, portraits, of, scriabin, and, pasternak, wrote, many, years, later, of, witnessing, with, great, excitement, the, creation, of, scriabin, s, symphony, no, 3, the, divine, poem, in, 1903, pasternak, began, to, compose, at, the, age, of, 13, the, high, achievements, of, his, mother, discouraged, him, from, becoming, a, pianist, but, inspired, by, scriabin, he, entered, the, moscow, conservatory, but, left, abruptly, in, 1910, at, the, age, of, twenty, to, study, philosophy, in, marburg, university, four, years, later, he, returned, to, moscow, having, finally, decided, on, a, career, in, literature, publishing, his, first, book, of, poems, influenced, by, aleksandr, blok, and, the, russian, futurists, the, same, year, pasternak, s, early, compositions, show, the, clear, influence, of, scriabin, his, single, movement, piano, sonata, of, 1909, shows, a, more, mature, and, individual, voice, nominally, in, b, minor, it, moves, freely, from, key, to, key, with, frequent, changes, of, key, signature, and, a, chromatic, dissonant, style, that, defies, easy, analysis, although, composed, during, his, time, at, the, conservatory, the, sonata, was, composed, at, rayki, some, 40, km, north, east, of, moscow, where, leonid, pasternak, had, his, painting, studio, and, taught, his, students
