in, the, state, treasury, according, to, shia, belief, harun, imprisoned, and, poisoned, musa, ibn, ja, far, the, 7th, imam, in, baghdad, under, al, rashid, each, city, had, its, own, law,

unsurpassed, splendor, of, his, court, and, lifestyle, some, of, the, stories, perhaps, the, earliest, of, the, thousand, and, one, nights, were, inspired, by, the, glittering, baghdad, court, the, character, king, shahryar, whose, wife, scheherazade, tells, the, tales, may, have, been, based, on, harun, himself, h, r, n, was, influenced, by, the, will, of, his, powerful, mother, in, the, governance, of, the, empire, until, her, death, in, 789, when, he, became, caliph, harun, allowed, her, khayzuran, a, free, hand, and, at, times, restrained, his, own, desires, out, of, deference, to, her, expressed, wishes, and, khayzuran, acted, as, an, overseer, of, affairs, and, yahya, deferred, to, her, and, acted, on, her, advice, his, vizier, chief, minister, yahya, the, barmakid, yahya, s, sons, especially, ja, far, ibn, yahya, and, other, barmakids, generally, controlled, the, administration, the, position, of, persians, in, the, abbasid, caliphal, court, reached, its, peak, during, al, rashid, s, reign, the, barmakids, were, an, iranian, family, from, balkh, that, dated, back, to, the, barmak, a, hereditary, buddhist, priest, of, nava, vihara, who, converted, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, balkh, and, became, very, powerful, under, al, mahdi, yahya, had, helped, h, r, n, to, obtain, the, caliphate, and, he, and, his, sons, were, in, high, favor, until, 798, when, the, caliph, threw, them, in, prison, and, confiscated, their, land, muhammad, ibn, jarir, al, tabari, dates, this, event, to, 803, and, lists, various, reasons, for, it, yahya, s, entering, the, caliph, s, presence, without, permission, yahya, s, opposition, to, muhammad, ibn, al, layth, who, later, gained, harun, s, favour, and, ja, far, s, release, of, yahya, ibn, abdallah, ibn, hasan, whom, harun, had, imprisoned, the, fall, of, the, barmakids, is, far, more, likely, due, to, their, behaving, in, a, manner, that, harun, found, disrespectful, such, as, entering, his, court, unannounced, and, making, decisions, in, matters, of, state, without, first, consulting, him, al, fadl, ibn, al, rabi, succeeded, yahya, the, barmakid, as, harun, s, chief, minister, both, einhard, and, notker, the, stammerer, refer, to, envoys, traveling, between, the, courts, of, harun, and, charlemagne, king, of, the, franks, and, entering, friendly, discussions, about, christian, access, to, holy, sites, and, gift, exchanges, notker, mentions, charlemagne, sent, harun, spanish, horses, colorful, frisian, cloaks, and, impressive, hunting, dogs, in, 802, harun, sent, charlemagne, a, present, consisting, of, silks, brass, candelabra, perfume, balsam, ivory, chessmen, a, colossal, tent, with, many, colored, curtains, an, elephant, named, abul, abbas, and, a, water, clock, that, marked, the, hours, by, dropping, bronze, balls, into, a, bowl, as, mechanical, knights, one, for, each, hour, emerged, from, little, doors, which, shut, behind, them, the, presents, were, unprecedented, in, western, europe, and, may, have, influenced, carolingian, art, this, exchange, of, embassies, was, due, to, the, fact, that, harun, was, interested, like, charlemagne, in, subduing, the, umayyad, emirs, of, c, rdoba, also, the, common, enmity, against, the, byzantines, was, what, brought, harun, closer, to, the, contemporary, charlemagne, when, the, byzantine, empress, irene, was, deposed, in, 802, nikephoros, i, became, emperor, and, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, harun, saying, that, irene, should, have, been, receiving, the, tribute, the, whole, time, news, of, this, angered, harun, who, wrote, a, message, on, the, back, of, the, byzantine, emperor, s, letter, and, said, in, the, name, of, god, the, most, merciful, from, amir, al, mu, minin, harun, ar, rashid, commander, of, the, faithful, to, nikephoros, dog, of, the, romans, thou, shalt, not, hear, thou, shalt, behold, my, reply, after, campaigns, in, asia, minor, nikephoros, was, forced, to, conclude, a, treaty, with, humiliating, terms, according, to, dr, ahmad, mukhtar, al, abadi, it, is, due, to, the, particularly, fierce, second, retribution, campaign, against, nikephoros, that, the, byzantine, practically, ceased, any, attempt, to, incite, any, conflict, against, the, abbasid, again, until, the, rule, of, al, ma, mun, an, alliance, was, established, with, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, by, ar, rashid, after, he, sent, embassies, to, china, he, was, called, a, lun, in, the, chinese, tang, annals, the, alliance, was, aimed, against, the, tibetans, when, diplomats, and, messengers, visited, harun, in, his, palace, he, was, screened, behind, a, curtain, no, visitor, or, petitioner, could, speak, first, interrupt, or, oppose, the, caliph, they, were, expected, to, give, their, undivided, attention, to, the, caliph, and, calculate, their, responses, with, great, care, because, of, the, thousand, and, one, nights, tales, harun, al, rashid, turned, into, a, legendary, figure, obscuring, his, true, historic, personality, in, fact, his, reign, initiated, the, political, disintegration, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, syria, was, inhabited, by, tribes, with, umayyad, sympathies, and, remained, the, bitter, enemy, of, the, abbasids, while, egypt, witnessed, uprisings, against, abbasids, due, to, maladministration, and, arbitrary, taxation, the, umayyads, had, been,
