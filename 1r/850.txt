the, lecture, mentioned, as, the, cause, was, on, the, british, economist, thomas, malthus, who, most, famously, studied, population, growth, and, its, effects, samuelson, felt, there, was, a, dissonance, between, neoclassical, economics, and, the, way, the, system, seemed, to, behave, he, said, henry, simons, and, frank, knight, were, a, big, influence, on, him, he, next, completed, his,

assistant, professor, in, 1940, and, remained, there, until, his, death, samuelson, s, biographer, argues, that, a, central, reason, for, samuelson, s, move, from, harvard, to, mit, was, the, anti, semitism, that, was, famously, widespread, at, harvard, at, the, time, in, a, 1989, letter, to, his, friend, henry, rosovsky, samuelson, blamed, anti, semitism, in, harvard, economics, above, all, on, chair, harold, burbank, as, well, as, on, edward, chamberlin, john, h, williams, john, d, black, and, leonard, crum, samuelson, s, family, included, many, well, known, economists, including, brother,

economics, professor, at, mit, and, the, president, of, the, national, bureau, of, economic, research, commented, that, samuelson, leaves, an, immense, legacy, as, a, researcher, and, a, teacher, as, one, of, the, giants, on, whose, shoulders, every, contemporary, economist, stands, susan, hockfield, the, president, of, mit, said, that, samuelson, transformed, everything, he, touched, the, theoretical, foundations, of, his, field, the, way, economics, was, taught, around, the, world, the, ethos, and, stature, of, his, department, the, investment, practices, of, mit, and, the, lives, of, his, colleagues, and, students, his, second, wife, died, in, 2019, as, professor, of, economics, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, samuelson, worked, in, many, fields, including, samuelson, is, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, neo, keynesian, economics, and, a, seminal, figure, in, the, development, of, neoclassical, economics, in, awarding, him, the, nobel, memorial, prize, in, economic, sciences, the, committee, stated, more, than, any, other, contemporary, economist, samuelson, has, helped, to, raise, the, general, analytical, and, methodological, level, in, economic, science, he, has, simply, rewritten, considerable, parts, of, economic, theory, he, has, also, shown, the, fundamental, unity, of, both, the, problems, and, analytical, techniques, in, economics, partly, by, a, systematic, application, of, the, methodology, of, maximization, for, a, broad, set, of, problems, this, means, that, samuelson, s, contributions, range, over, a, large, number, of, different, fields, he, was, also, essential, in, creating, the, neoclassical, synthesis, which, ostensibly, incorporated, keynesian, and, neoclassical, principles, and, still, dominates, current, mainstream, economics, in, 2003, samuelson, was, one, of, the, ten, nobel, prize, winning, economists, signing, the, economists, statement, opposing, the, bush, tax, cuts, samuelson, believed, unregulated, markets, have, drawbacks, he, stated, free, markets, do, not, stabilise, themselves, zero, regulating, is, vastly, suboptimal, to, rational, regulating, libertarianism, is, its, own, worst, enemy, samuelson, strongly, criticised, friedman, and, friedrich, hayek, arguing, their, opposition, to, state, intervention, tells, us, something, about, them, rather, than, something, about, genghis, khan, or, franklin, roosevelt, it, is, paranoid, to, warn, against, inevitable, slippery, slopes, once, individual, commercial, freedoms, are, in, any, way, infringed, upon, stanislaw, ulam, once, challenged, samuelson, to, name, one, theory, in, all, of, the, social, sciences, that, is, both, true, and, nontrivial, several, years, later, samuelson, responded, with, david, ricardo, s, theory, of, comparative, advantage, that, it, is, logically, true, need, not, be, argued, before, a, mathematician, that, is, not, trivial, is, attested, by, the, thousands, of, important, and, intelligent, men, who, have, never, been, able, to, grasp, the, doctrine, for, themselves, or, to, believe, it, after, it, was, explained, to, them, for, many, years, samuelson, wrote, a, column, for, newsweek, one, article, included, samuelson, s, most, quoted, remark, and, a, favorite, economics, joke, to, prove, that, wall, street, is, an, early, omen, of, movements, still, to, come, in, gnp, commentators, quote, economic, studies, alleging, that, market, downturns, predicted, four, out, of, the, last, five, recessions, that, is, an, understatement, wall, street, indexes, predicted, nine, out, of, the, last, five, recessions, and, its, mistakes, were, beauties, in, the, early, editions, of, his, famous, bestselling, economics, textbook, paul, samuelson, joked, that, gdp, falls, when, a, man, marries, his, maid, paul, samuelson, s, book, foundations, of, economic, analysis, 1946, is, considered, his, magnum, opus, it, is, derived, from, his, doctoral, dissertation, and, was, inspired, by, the, classical, thermodynamic, methods, the, book, proposes, to, in, order, to, derive, a, general, theory, of, economic, theories, samuelson, 1983, p, xxvi, the, book, showed, how, these, goals, could, be, parsimoniously, and, fruitfully, achieved, using, the, language, of, the, mathematics, applied, to, diverse, subfields, of, economics, the, book, proposes, two, general, hypotheses, as, sufficient, for, its, purposes, the, first, tenet, suggests, that, all, actors, whether, firms, or, consumers, are, striving, to, maximize, something, they, could, be, attempting, to, maximize, profits, utility, or, wealth, but, it, did, not, matter, because, their, efforts, to, improve, their, well, being, would, provide, a, basic, model, for, all, actors, in, an, economic, system, his, second, tenet, focuses, on, providing, insight, on, the, workings, of, equilibrium, in, an, economy, generally, in, a, market, supply, would, equal, demand, however, he, noted, that, this, isn, t, always, the, case, and, that, the, important, thing, to, look, at, was, a, system, s, natural, resting, point, foundations, presents, the, question, of, how, an, equilibrium, would, react, when, it, is, moved, from, its, optimal, point, samuelson, was, also, influential, in, providing, explanations, on, how, the, changes, in, certain, factors, can, affect, an, economic, system, for, example, he, could, explain, the, economic, effect, of, changes, in, taxes, or, new, technologies, in, the, course, of, analysis, comparative, statics, the, analysis, of, changes, in, equilibrium, of, the, system, that, result, from, a, parameter, change, of, the, system, is, formalized, and, clearly, stated, the, chapter, on, welfare, economics, attempt, s, to, give, a, brief, but, fairly, complete, survey, of, the, whole, field, of, welfare, economics, samuelson, 1947, p, 252, it, also, exposits, on, and, develops, what, became, commonly, called, the, bergson, samuelson, social, welfare, function, it, shows, how, to, represent, in, the, maximization, calculus, all, real, valued, economic, measures, of, any, belief, system, that, is, required, to, rank, consistently, different, feasible, social, configurations, in, an, ethical, sense, as, better, than, worse, than, or, indifferent, to, each, other, p, 221, samuelson, is, also, author, and, from, 1985, co, author, of, an, influential, principles, textbook, economics, first, published, in, 1948, 19th, ed, as, of, 2010, multiple, reprints, the, book, sold, more, than, 300, 000, copies, of, each, edition, from, 1961, through, 1976, and, was, translated, into, forty, one, languages, as, of, 2018, it, had, sold, over, four, million, copies, william, nordhaus, joined, as, co, author, on, the, 12th, edition, 1985, sometime, before, 1988, it, had, become, the, best, selling, economics, textbook, of, all, time, samuelson, was, once, quoted, as, saying, let, those, who, will, write, the, nation, s, laws, if, i, can, write, its, textbooks, written, in, the, shadow, of, the, great, depression, and, the, second, world, war, it, helped, to, popularize, the, insights, of, john, maynard, keynes, a, main, focus, was, how, to, avoid, or, at, least, mitigate, the, recurring, slumps, in, economic, activity, samuelson, wrote, it, is, not, too, much, to, say, that, the, widespread, creation, of, dictatorships, and, the, resulting, world, war, ii, stemmed, in, no, small, measure, from, the, world, s, failure, to, meet, this, basic, economic, problem, adequately, this, reflected, the, concern, of, keynes, himself, with, the, economic, causes, of, war, and, the, importance, of, economic, policy, in, promoting, peace, samuelson, s, book, was, the, second, to, introduce, keynesian, economics, to, a, wide, audience, and, was, by, far, the, most, successful, canadian, economist, lorie, tarshis, who, had, been, a, student, attending, keynes, s, lectures, at, harvard, in, the, 1930s, published, in, 1947, an, introductory, textbook, that, incorporated, his, lecture, notes, titled, elements, of, economics, samuelson, s, textbook, was, a, watershed, in, introducing, the, serious, study, of, business, cycles, to, the, economics, curriculum, it, was, particularly, timely, because, it, followed, the, great, depression, the, study, of, business, cycles, along, with, the, introduction, of, the, keynesian, approach, of, aggregate, demand, set, the, stage, for, the, macroeconomic, revolution, in, america, which, then, diffused, throughout, the, world, through, translations, into, every, major, language, generations, of, students, who, then, became, teachers, learned, their, first, and, most, influential, lessons, from, samuelson, s, economics, it, attracted, many, imitators, who, became, successful, in, different, niches, of, the, college, market, the, text, was, not, without, criticism, while, it, praised, the, mixed, economy, of, market, and, government, some, found, that, too, radical, and, attacked, it, as, socialist, as, a, precursor, to, criticisms, of, samuelson, s, economics, textbook, lorie, tarshis, s, textbook, was, attacked, by, trustees, of, and, donors, to, american, colleges, and, universities, as, preaching, a, socialist, heresy, piling, on, william, f, buckley, jr, in, his, 1951, book, god, and, man, at, yale, devoted, an, entire, chapter, attacking, both, samuelson, s, and, tarshis, textbooks, for, samuelson, s, book, buckley, drew, from, the, educational, examiner, and, credited, it, as, an, excellent, review, of, samuelson, s, text, note, to, chapter, two, p, 234, for, tarshis, book, buckley, drew, from, merwin, k, hart, s, organization, to, wit, i, am, also, grateful, to, the, national, economic, council, for, its, telling, analysis, of, the, tarshis, note, to, chapter, two, p, 234, buckley, essentially, characterized, both, as, in, the, words, of, paul, davidson, communist, inspired, buckley, for, the, rest, of, his, life, defended, the, criticisms, set, forth, in, his, book, there, are, 388, papers, in, samuelson, s, collected, scientific, papers, stanley, fischer, 1987, p, 234, writes, that, taken, together, they, are, unique, in, their, verve, breadth, of, economic, and, general, knowledge, mastery, of, setting, and, generosity, of, allusions, to, predecessors, samuelson, was, co, editor, along, with, william, a, barnett, of, inside, the, economist, s, mind, conversations, with, eminent, economists, blackwell, publishing, 2007, a, collection, of, interviews, with, notable, economists, of, the, 20th, century
