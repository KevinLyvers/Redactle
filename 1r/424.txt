through, gradual, and, steady, reform, not, revolution, and, this, attitude, was, reflected, in, his, attitude, toward, universal, suffrage, which, he, did, not, outright, reject, but, recommended,

sound, quality, is, poor, as, wax, cylinder, recordings, usually, are, towards, the, end, of, his, life, tennyson, revealed, that, his, religious, beliefs, also, defied, convention, leaning, towards, agnosticism, and, pandeism, in, a, characteristically, victorian, manner, tennyson, combines, a, deep, interest, in, contemporary, science, with, an, unorthodox, even, idiosyncratic, christian, belief, famously, he, wrote, in, in, memoriam, there, lives, more, faith, in, honest, doubt, believe, me, than, in, half, the, creeds, in, maud, 1855, he, wrote, the, churches, have, killed, their,

by, frederick, weld, is, assumed, to, be, named, after, lord, tennyson, he, was, succeeded, as, 2nd, baron, tennyson, by, his, son, hallam, who, produced, an, authorised, biography, of, his, father, in, 1897, and, was, later, the, second, governor, general, of, australia, although, albert, prince, consort, was, largely, responsible, for, tennyson, s, appointment, as, laureate, queen, victoria, became, an, ardent, admirer, of, tennyson, s, work, writing, in, her, diary, that, she, was, much, soothed, pleased, by, reading, in, memoriam, a, h, h, after, albert, s, death, the, two, met, twice, first, in, april, 1862, when, victoria, wrote, in, her, diary, very, peculiar, looking, tall, dark, with, a, fine, head, long, black, flowing, hair, a, beard, oddly, dressed, but, there, is, no, affectation, about, him, tennyson, met, her, a, second, time, just, over, two, decades, later, on, 7, august, 1883, and, the, queen, told, him, what, a, comfort, in, memoriam, a, h, h, had, been, as, source, material, for, his, poetry, tennyson, used, a, wide, range, of, subject, matter, ranging, from, medieval, legends, to, classical, myths, and, from, domestic, situations, to, observations, of, nature, the, influence, of, john, keats, and, other, romantic, poets, published, before, and, during, his, childhood, is, evident, from, the, richness, of, his, imagery, and, descriptive, writing, he, also, handled, rhythm, masterfully, the, insistent, beat, of, break, break, break, emphasises, the, relentless, sadness, of, the, subject, matter, tennyson, s, use, of, the, musical, qualities, of, words, to, emphasise, his, rhythms, and, meanings, is, sensitive, the, language, of, i, come, from, haunts, of, coot, and, hern, lilts, and, ripples, like, the, brook, in, the, poem, and, the, last, two, lines, of, come, down, o, maid, from, yonder, mountain, height, illustrate, his, telling, combination, of, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and, assonance, the, moan, of, doves, in, immemorial, elms, and, murmuring, of, innumerable, bees, tennyson, was, a, craftsman, who, polished, and, revised, his, manuscripts, extensively, to, the, point, where, his, efforts, at, self, editing, were, described, by, his, contemporary, robert, browning, as, insane, symptomatic, of, mental, infirmity, his, complex, compositional, practice, and, frequent, redrafting, also, demonstrates, a, dynamic, relationship, between, images, and, words, as, can, be, seen, in, the, many, notebooks, he, worked, in, few, poets, have, used, such, a, variety, of, styles, with, such, an, exact, understanding, of, metre, like, many, victorian, poets, he, experimented, in, adapting, the, quantitative, metres, of, greek, and, latin, poetry, to, english, he, reflects, the, victorian, period, of, his, maturity, in, his, feeling, for, order, and, his, tendency, towards, moralising, he, also, reflects, a, concern, common, among, victorian, writers, in, being, troubled, by, the, conflict, between, religious, faith, and, expanding, scientific, knowledge, tennyson, possessed, a, strong, poetic, power, which, his, early, readers, often, attributed, to, his, englishness, and, his, masculinity, well, known, among, his, longer, works, are, maud, and, idylls, of, the, king, the, latter, arguably, the, most, famous, victorian, adaptation, of, the, legend, of, king, arthur, and, the, knights, of, the, round, table, a, common, thread, of, grief, melancholy, and, loss, connects, much, of, his, poetry, including, mariana, the, lotos, eaters, tears, idle, tears, in, memoriam, possibly, reflecting, tennyson, s, own, lifelong, struggle, with, debilitating, depression, t, s, eliot, famously, described, tennyson, as, the, saddest, of, all, english, poets, whose, technical, mastery, of, verse, and, language, provided, a, surface, to, his, poetry, s, depths, to, the, abyss, of, sorrow, other, poets, such, as, w, h, auden, maintained, a, more, critical, stance, stating, that, tennyson, was, the, stupidest, of, all, the, english, poets, adding, that, there, was, little, about, melancholia, he, didn, t, know, there, was, little, else, that, he, did, tennyson, s, early, poetry, with, its, medievalism, and, powerful, visual, imagery, was, a, major, influence, on, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, in, 1848, dante, gabriel, rossetti, and, william, holman, hunt, made, a, list, of, immortals, artistic,
