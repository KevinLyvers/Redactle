louis, henry, sullivan, september, 3, 1856, april, 14, 1924, was, an, american, architect, and, has, been, called, a, father, of, skyscrapers, and, father, of, modernism, he, was, an, influential, architect, of, the, chicago, school, a, mentor, to, frank, lloyd, wright, and, an, inspiration, to, the, chicago, group, of, architects, who, have, come, to, be, known, as, the, prairie, school, along, with, wright, and, henry, hobson, richardson, sullivan, is, one, of, the, recognized, trinity, of, american, architecture, the, phrase, form, follows, function, is, attributed, to, him, although, the, idea, was, theorised, by, viollet, le, duc, who, considered, that, structure, and, function, in, architecture, should, be, the, sole, determinants, of, form, in, 1944, sullivan, was, the, second, architect, to, posthumously, receive, the, aia, gold, medal, sullivan, was, born, to, a, swiss, born, mother, n, e, andrienne, list, who, had, emigrated, to, boston, from, geneva, with, her, parents, and, two, siblings, jenny, b, 1836, and, jules, b, 1841, and, an, irish, born, father, patrick, sullivan, both, had, immigrated, to, the, united, states, in, the, late, 1840s, he, learned, that, he, could, both, graduate, from, high, school, a, year, early, and, bypass, the, first, two, years, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, by, passing, a, series, of, examinations, entering, mit, at, the, age, of, sixteen, sullivan, studied, architecture, there, briefly, after, one, year, of, study, he, moved, to, philadelphia, and, took, a, job, with, architect, frank, furness, the, depression, of, 1873, dried, up, much, of, furness, s, work, and, he, was, forced, to, let, sullivan, go, sullivan, moved, to, chicago, in, 1873, to, take, part, in, the, building, boom, following, the, great, chicago, fire, of, 1871, he, worked, for, william, lebaron, jenney, the, architect, often, credited, with, erecting, the, first, steel, frame, building, after, less, than, a, year, with, jenney, sullivan, moved, to, paris, and, studied, at, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, for, a, year, he, returned, to, chicago, and, began, work, for, the, firm, of, joseph, s, johnston, john, edelman, as, a, draftsman, johnston, edleman, were, commissioned, for, the, design, of, the, moody, tabernacle, and, tasked, sullivan, with, the, design, of, the, interior, decorative, fresco, secco, stencils, stencil, technique, applied, on, dry, plaster, in, 1879, dankmar, adler, hired, sullivan, a, year, later, sullivan, became, a, partner, in, adler, s, firm, this, marked, the, beginning, of, sullivan, s, most, productive, years, adler, and, sullivan, initially, achieved, fame, as, theater, architects, while, most, of, their, theaters, were, in, chicago, their, fame, won, commissions, as, far, west, as, pueblo, colorado, and, seattle, washington, unbuilt, the, culminating, project, of, this, phase, of, the, firm, s, history, was, the, 1889, auditorium, building, 1886, 90, opened, in, stages, in, chicago, an, extraordinary, mixed, use, building, that, included, not, only, a, 4, 200, seat, theater, but, also, a, hotel, and, an, office, building, with, a, 17, story, tower, and, commercial, storefronts, at, the, ground, level, of, the, building, fronting, congress, and, wabash, avenues, after, 1889, the, firm, became, known, for, their, office, buildings, particularly, the, 1891, wainwright, building, in, st, louis, and, the, schiller, later, garrick, building, and, theater, 1890, in, chicago, other, buildings, often, noted, include, the, chicago, stock, exchange, building, 1894, the, guaranty, building, also, known, as, the, prudential, building, of, 1895, 96, in, buffalo, new, york, and, the, 1899, 1904, carson, pirie, scott, department, store, by, sullivan, on, state, street, in, chicago, prior, to, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, weight, of, a, multi, story, building, had, to, be, supported, principally, by, the, strength, of, its, walls, the, taller, the, building, the, more, strain, this, placed, on, the, lower, sections, of, the, building, since, there, were, clear, engineering, limits, to, the, weight, such, load, bearing, walls, could, sustain, tall, designs, meant, massively, thick, walls, on, the, ground, floors, and, definite, limits, on, the, building, s, height, the, development, of, cheap, versatile, steel, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, changed, those, rules, america, was, in, the, midst, of, rapid, social, and, economic, growth, that, made, for, great, opportunities, in, architectural, design, a, much, more, urbanized, society, was, forming, and, the, society, called, out, for, new, larger, buildings, the, mass, production, of, steel, was, the, main, driving, force, behind, the, ability, to, build, skyscrapers, during, the, mid, 1880s, by, assembling, a, framework, of, steel, girders, architects, and, builders, could, create, tall, slender, buildings, with, a, strong, and, relatively, lightweight, steel, skeleton, the, rest, of, the, building, elements, walls, floors, ceilings, and, windows, were, suspended, from, the, skeleton, which, carried, the, weight, this, new, way, of, constructing, buildings, so, called, column, frame, construction, pushed, them, up, rather, than, out, the, steel, weight, bearing, frame, allowed, not, just, taller, buildings, but, permitted, much, larger, windows, which, meant, more, daylight, reaching, interior, spaces, interior, walls, became, thinner, which, created, more, usable, and, rentable, floor, space, chicago, s, monadnock, building, not, designed, by, sullivan, straddles, this, remarkable, moment, of, transition, the, northern, half, of, the, building, finished, in, 1891, is, of, load, bearing, construction, while, the, southern, half, finished, only, two, years, later, is, of, column, frame, construction, while, experiments, in, this, new, technology, were, taking, place, in, many, cities, chicago, was, the, crucial, laboratory, industrial, capital, and, civic, pride, drove, a, surge, of, new, construction, throughout, the, city, s, downtown, in, the, wake, of, the, 1871, fire, the, technical, limits, of, weight, bearing, masonry, had, imposed, formal, as, well, as, structural, constraints, suddenly, those, constraints, were, gone, none, of, the, historical, precedents, needed, to, be, applied, and, this, new, freedom, resulted, in, a, technical, and, stylistic, crisis, of, sorts, sullivan, addressed, it, by, embracing, the, changes, that, came, with, the, steel, frame, creating, a, grammar, of, form, for, the, high, rise, base, shaft, and, cornice, simplifying, the, appearance, of, the, building, by, breaking, away, from, historical, styles, using, his, own, intricate, floral, designs, in, vertical, bands, to, draw, the, eye, upward, and, to, emphasize, the, vertical, form, of, the, building, and, relating, the, shape, of, the, building, to, its, specific, purpose, all, this, was, revolutionary, appealingly, honest, and, commercially, successful, in, 1896, louis, sullivan, wrote, it, is, the, pervading, law, of, all, things, organic, and, inorganic, of, all, things, physical, and, metaphysical, of, all, things, human, and, all, things, super, human, of, all, true, manifestations, of, the, head, of, the, heart, of, the, soul, that, the, life, is, recognizable, in, its, expression, that, form, ever, follows, function, this, is, the, law, italics, in, original, form, follows, function, would, become, one, of, the, prevailing, tenets, of, modern, architects, sullivan, attributed, the, concept, to, marcus, vitruvius, pollio, the, roman, architect, engineer, and, author, who, first, asserted, in, his, book, de, architectura, on, architecture, that, a, structure, must, exhibit, the, three, qualities, of, firmitas, utilitas, venustas, that, is, it, must, be, solid, useful, beautiful, this, credo, which, placed, the, demands, of, practical, use, equal, to, aesthetics, later, would, be, taken, by, influential, designers, to, imply, that, decorative, elements, which, architects, call, ornament, were, superfluous, in, modern, buildings, but, sullivan, neither, thought, nor, designed, along, such, dogmatic, lines, during, the, peak, of, his, career, and, this, credo, never, put, one, concept, above, another, while, his, buildings, could, be, spare, and, crisp, in, their, principal, masses, he, often, punctuated, their, plain, surfaces, with, eruptions, of, lush, art, nouveau, or, celtic, revival, decorations, usually, cast, in, iron, or, terra, cotta, and, ranging, from, organic, forms, such, as, vines, and, ivy, to, more, geometric, designs, and, interlace, inspired, by, his, irish, design, heritage, terra, cotta, is, lighter, and, easier, to, work, with, than, stone, masonry, sullivan, used, it, in, his, architecture, because, it, had, a, malleability, that, was, appropriate, for, his, ornament, probably, the, most, famous, example, of, ornament, used, by, sullivan, is, the, writhing, green, ironwork, that, covers, the, entrance, canopies, of, the, carson, pirie, scott, store, on, south, state, street, such, ornaments, often, executed, by, the, talented, younger, draftsmen, in, sullivan, s, employ, eventually, would, become, sullivan, s, trademark, to, students, of, architecture, they, are, instantly, recognizable, as, his, signature, another, signature, element, of, sullivan, s, work, is, the, massive, semi, circular, arch, sullivan, employed, such, arches, throughout, his, career, in, shaping, entrances, in, framing, windows, or, as, interior, design, all, of, these, elements, are, found, in, sullivan, s, widely, admired, guaranty, building, which, he, designed, while, partnered, with, adler, completed, in, 1895, this, office, building, in, buffalo, new, york, is, in, the, palazzo, style, visibly, divided, into, three, zones, of, design, a, plain, wide, windowed, base, for, the, ground, level, shops, the, main, office, block, with, vertical, ribbons, of, masonry, rising, unimpeded, across, nine, upper, floors, to, emphasize, the, building, s, height, and, an, ornamented, cornice, perforated, by, round, windows, at, the, roof, level, where, the, building, s, mechanical, units, such, as, the, elevator, motors, were, housed, the, cornice, is, covered, by, sullivan, s, trademark, art, nouveau, vines, and, each, ground, floor, entrance, is, topped, by, a, semi, circular, arch, because, sullivan, s, remarkable, accomplishments, in, design, and, construction, occurred, at, such, a, critical, time, in, architectural, history, he, often, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, the, american, skyscraper, but, many, architects, had, been, building, skyscrapers, before, or, as, contemporaries, of, sullivan, they, were, designed, as, an, expression, of, new, technology, chicago, was, replete, with, extraordinary, designers, and, builders, in, the, late, years, of, the, nineteenth, century, including, sullivan, s, partner, dankmar, adler, as, well, as, daniel, burnham, and, john, wellborn, root, root, was, one, of, the, builders, of, the, monadnock, building, see, above, that, and, another, root, design, the, masonic, temple, tower, both, in, chicago, are, cited, by, many, as, the, originators, of, skyscraper, aesthetics, of, bearing, wall, and, column, frame, construction, respectively, in, 1890, sullivan, was, one, of, the, ten, u, s, architects, five, from, the, east, and, five, from, the, west, chosen, to, build, a, major, structure, for, the, white, city, the, world, s, columbian, exposition, held, in, chicago, in, 1893, sullivan, s, massive, transportation, building, and, huge, arched, golden, door, stood, out, as, the, only, building, not, of, the, current, beaux, arts, style, and, with, the, only, multicolored, facade, in, the, entire, white, city, sullivan, and, fair, director, daniel, burnham, were, vocal, about, their, displeasure, with, each, other, sullivan, later, claimed, 1922, that, the, fair, set, the, course, of, american, architecture, back, for, half, a, century, from, its, date, if, not, longer, his, was, the, only, building, to, receive, extensive, recognition, outside, america, receiving, three, medals, from, the, french, based, union, centrale, des, arts, decoratifs, the, following, year, like, all, american, architects, adler, and, sullivan, suffered, a, precipitous, decline, in, their, practice, with, the, onset, of, the, panic, of, 1893, according, to, charles, bebb, who, was, working, in, the, office, at, that, time, adler, borrowed, money, to, try, to, keep, employees, on, the, payroll, by, 1894, however, in, the, face, of, continuing, financial, distress, with, no, relief, in, sight, adler, and, sullivan, dissolved, their, partnership, the, guaranty, building, was, considered, the, last, major, project, of, the, firm, by, both, temperament, and, connections, adler, had, been, the, one, who, brought, in, new, business, to, the, partnership, and, following, the, rupture, sullivan, received, few, large, commissions, after, the, carson, pirie, scott, department, store, he, went, into, a, twenty, year, long, financial, and, emotional, decline, beset, by, a, shortage, of, commissions, chronic, financial, problems, and, alcoholism, he, obtained, a, few, commissions, for, small, town, midwestern, banks, see, below, wrote, books, and, in, 1922, appeared, as, a, critic, of, raymond, hood, s, winning, entry, for, the, tribune, tower, competition, in, 1922, sullivan, was, paid, 100, a, month, to, write, an, autobiography, in, installments, to, be, published, in, the, journal, for, the, american, institute, of, architects, sullivan, worked, on, the, series, with, journal, editor, charles, harris, whitaker, who, advised, he, plot, out, the, material, by, periods, the, autobiography, of, an, idea, began, its, publication, in, the, june, 1922, journal, for, the, american, institute, of, architects, and, upon, its, conclusion, was, published, as, a, book, he, died, in, a, chicago, hotel, room, on, april, 14, 1924, he, left, a, wife, mary, azona, hattabaugh, from, whom, he, was, separated, a, modest, headstone, marks, his, final, resting, spot, in, graceland, cemetery, in, chicago, s, uptown, and, lake, view, neighborhood, later, a, monument, was, erected, in, sullivan, s, honor, a, few, feet, from, his, headstone, sullivan, s, legacy, is, contradictory, some, consider, him, the, first, modernist, his, forward, looking, designs, clearly, anticipate, some, issues, and, solutions, of, modernism, however, his, embrace, of, ornament, makes, his, contribution, distinct, from, the, modern, movement, that, coalesced, in, the, 1920s, and, became, known, as, the, international, style, sullivan, s, built, work, expresses, the, appeal, of, his, incredible, designs, the, vertical, bands, on, the, wainwright, building, the, burst, of, welcoming, art, nouveau, ironwork, on, the, corner, entrance, of, the, carson, pirie, scott, store, the, lost, terra, cotta, griffins, and, porthole, windows, on, the, union, trust, building, and, the, white, angels, of, the, bayard, building, sullivan, s, only, work, in, new, york, city, except, for, some, designs, by, his, longtime, draftsman, george, grant, elmslie, and, the, occasional, tribute, to, sullivan, such, as, schmidt, garden, martin, s, first, national, bank, in, pueblo, colorado, built, across, the, street, from, adler, and, sullivan, s, pueblo, opera, house, his, style, is, unique, a, visit, to, the, preserved, chicago, stock, exchange, trading, floor, now, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, is, proof, of, the, immediate, and, visceral, power, of, the, ornament, that, he, used, so, selectively, after, his, death, sullivan, was, referred, to, as, a, bold, architect, boldly, he, challenged, the, whole, theory, of, copying, and, imitating, and, the, catchword, of, precedent, declaring, that, architecture, was, naturally, a, living, and, creative, art, original, drawings, and, other, archival, materials, from, sullivan, are, held, by, the, ryerson, burnham, libraries, in, the, art, institute, of, chicago, and, by, the, drawings, and, archives, department, in, the, avery, architectural, and, fine, arts, library, at, columbia, university, fragments, of, sullivan, buildings, also, are, held, in, many, fine, art, and, design, museums, around, the, world, during, the, postwar, era, of, urban, renewal, sullivan, s, works, fell, into, disfavor, and, many, were, demolished, in, the, 1970s, growing, public, concern, for, these, buildings, finally, resulted, in, many, being, saved, the, most, vocal, voice, was, richard, nickel, who, organized, protests, against, the, demolition, of, architecturally, significant, buildings, nickel, and, others, sometimes, rescued, decorative, elements, from, condemned, buildings, sneaking, in, during, demolition, nickel, died, inside, sullivan, s, stock, exchange, building, while, trying, to, retrieve, some, elements, when, a, floor, above, him, collapsed, nickel, had, compiled, extensive, research, on, adler, and, sullivan, and, their, many, architectural, commissions, which, he, intended, to, publish, in, book, form, after, nickel, s, death, in, 1972, the, richard, nickel, committee, was, formed, to, arrange, for, completion, of, his, book, which, was, published, in, 2010, the, book, features, all, 256, commissions, of, adler, and, sullivan, the, extensive, archive, of, photographs, and, research, that, underpinned, the, book, was, donated, to, the, ryerson, and, burnham, libraries, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, more, than, 1, 300, photographs, may, be, viewed, on, their, website, and, more, than, 15, 000, photographs, are, part, of, the, collection, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, as, finally, published, the, book, the, complete, architecture, of, adler, sullivan, was, authored, by, richard, nickel, aaron, siskind, john, vinci, and, ward, miller, another, champion, of, sullivan, s, legacy, was, the, architect, crombie, taylor, 1907, 1991, of, crombie, taylor, associates, after, working, in, chicago, where, he, had, headed, the, famous, institute, of, design, later, known, as, the, illinois, institute, of, technology, iit, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, he, had, moved, to, southern, california, he, led, the, effort, to, save, the, van, allen, building, in, clinton, iowa, from, demolition, taylor, acting, as, an, aesthetic, consultant, had, worked, on, the, renovation, of, the, auditorium, building, now, roosevelt, university, in, chicago, when, he, read, an, article, about, the, planned, demolition, in, clinton, he, uprooted, his, family, from, their, home, in, southern, california, and, moved, them, to, iowa, with, the, vision, of, a, destination, neighborhood, comparable, to, oak, park, illinois, he, set, about, creating, a, nonprofit, to, save, the, building, and, was, successful, in, doing, so, another, advocate, both, of, sullivan, buildings, and, of, wright, structures, was, jack, randall, who, led, an, effort, to, save, the, wainwright, building, in, st, louis, missouri, at, a, very, critical, time, he, relocated, his, family, to, buffalo, new, york, to, save, sullivan, s, guaranty, building, and, frank, lloyd, wright, s, darwin, martin, house, from, possible, demolition, his, efforts, were, successful, in, both, st, louis, and, buffalo, a, collection, of, architectural, ornaments, designed, by, sullivan, is, on, permanent, display, at, lovejoy, library, at, southern, illinois, university, edwardsville, the, st, louis, art, museum, also, has, sullivan, architectural, elements, displayed, the, city, museum, in, st, louis, has, a, large, collection, of, sullivan, ornamentation, on, display, including, a, cornice, from, the, demolished, chicago, stock, exchange, 29, feet, long, on, one, side, 13, feet, on, another, and, nine, feet, high, the, guaranty, building, interpretive, center, in, buffalo, on, the, first, floor, of, the, building, now, owned, and, occupied, by, the, law, firm, hodgson, russ, llp, opened, in, 2017, the, exhibit, space, was, financed, by, hodgson, russ, llp, and, co, designed, by, flynn, battaglia, architects, and, hadley, exhibits, it, features, a, scale, model, of, the, building, by, david, j, carli, professor, of, engineering, at, the, state, university, of, new, york, at, alfred, the, center, s, exhibits, were, donated, to, preservation, buffalo, niagara, the, center, the, only, museum, dedicated, to, sullivan, is, open, to, the, public, that, the, fictional, character, of, henry, cameron, in, ayn, rand, s, 1943, novel, the, fountainhead, was, similar, to, the, real, life, sullivan, was, noted, if, only, in, passing, by, at, least, one, journalist, contemporary, to, the, book, although, rand, s, journal, notes, contain, in, toto, only, some, 50, lines, directly, referring, to, sullivan, it, is, clear, from, her, mention, of, sullivan, s, autobiography, of, an, idea, 1924, in, her, 25th, anniversary, introduction, to, her, earlier, novel, we, the, living, first, published, in, 1936, and, unrelated, to, architecture, that, she, was, intimately, familiar, with, his, life, and, career, the, term, the, fountainhead, which, appears, nowhere, in, rand, s, novel, proper, is, found, twice, as, the, fountainhead, and, later, as, the, fountain, head, in, sullivan, s, autobiography, both, times, used, metaphorically, the, fictional, cameron, is, like, sullivan, whose, physical, description, he, matches, a, great, innovative, skyscraper, pioneer, late, in, the, nineteenth, century, who, dies, impoverished, and, embittered, in, the, mid, 1920s, cameron, s, rapid, decline, is, explicitly, attributed, to, the, wave, of, classical, greco, roman, revivalism, in, architecture, in, the, wake, of, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, just, as, sullivan, in, his, autobiography, attributed, his, own, downfall, to, the, same, event, the, major, difference, between, novel, and, real, life, was, in, the, chronology, of, cameron, s, relation, with, his, prot, g, howard, roark, the, novel, s, hero, who, eventually, goes, on, to, redeem, his, vision, that, roark, s, uncompromising, individualism, and, his, innovative, organic, style, in, architecture, were, drawn, from, the, life, and, work, of, frank, lloyd, wright, is, clear, from, rand, s, journal, notes, her, correspondence, and, various, contemporary, accounts, in, the, novel, however, the, 23, year, old, roark, a, generation, younger, than, the, real, life, wright, becomes, cameron, s, prot, g, in, the, early, 1920s, when, sullivan, was, long, in, decline, the, young, wright, by, contrast, was, sullivan, s, prot, g, for, seven, years, beginning, in, 1887, when, sullivan, was, at, the, height, of, his, fame, and, power, the, two, architects, would, sever, their, ties, in, 1894, due, to, sullivan, s, angry, reaction, to, wright, s, moonlighting, in, breach, of, his, contract, with, sullivan, but, wright, continued, to, call, sullivan, lieber, meister, beloved, master, for, the, rest, of, his, life, after, decades, of, estrangement, wright, would, again, become, close, to, the, now, destitute, sullivan, in, the, early, 1920s, the, time, when, roark, first, comes, under, the, likewise, impoverished, cameron, s, tutelage, in, the, novel, wright, however, was, now, in, his, fifties, nevertheless, both, the, young, roark, and, middle, aged, wright, had, in, common, at, that, time, that, they, both, faced, a, decade, of, struggle, ahead, after, the, triumphs, earlier, in, his, career, wright, came, increasingly, to, be, viewed, as, a, has, been, until, he, experienced, a, renaissance, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 1930s, with, such, projects, as, fallingwater, and, the, johnson, wax, headquarters, buildings, 1887, 1895, by, adler, sullivan, buildings, 1887, 1922, by, louis, sullivan, 256, total, commissions, and, projects, by, the, end, of, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, sullivan, s, star, was, well, on, the, descent, and, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, his, output, consisted, primarily, of, a, series, of, small, bank, and, commercial, buildings, in, the, midwest, yet, a, look, at, these, buildings, clearly, reveals, that, sullivan, s, muse, had, not, abandoned, him, when, the, director, of, a, bank, that, was, considering, hiring, him, asked, sullivan, why, they, should, engage, him, at, a, cost, higher, than, the, bids, received, for, a, conventional, neo, classic, styled, building, from, other, architects, sullivan, is, reported, to, have, replied, a, thousand, architects, could, design, those, buildings, only, i, can, design, this, one, he, got, the, job, today, these, commissions, are, collectively, referred, to, as, sullivan, s, jewel, boxes, all, still, stand, notes, bibliography
