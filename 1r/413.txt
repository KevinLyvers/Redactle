bockhampton, at, the, age, of, eight, for, several, years, he, attended, mr, last, s, academy, for, young, gentlemen, in, dorchester, where, he, learned, latin, and, demonstrated, academic, potential, because, hardy, s, family, lacked, the, means, for, a, university, education, his, formal, education, ended, at, the, age, of, sixteen, when, he, became, apprenticed, to, james, hicks, a, local, architect, he, worked, on, the, design, of, the, new, church, at, nearby, athelhampton, situated, just, opposite, athelhampton, house, where, he, painted, a, watercolour, of, the, tudor, gatehouse,

pancras, old, church, before, its, destruction, when, the, midland, railway, was, extended, to, a, new, terminus, at, st, pancras, hardy, never, felt, at, home, in, london, because, he, was, acutely, conscious, of, class, divisions, and, his, social, inferiority, during, this, time, he, became, interested, in, social, reform, and, the, works, of, john, stuart, mill, he, was, introduced, by, his, dorset, friend, horace, moule, to, the, works, of, charles, fourier, and, auguste, comte, mill, s, essay, on, liberty, was, one, of, hardy, s, cures, for, despair, and, in, 1924, he, declared, that, my, pages, show, harmony, of, view, with, mill, he, was, also, attracted, to, matthew, arnold, s, and, leslie, stephen, s, ideal, of, the, urbane, liberal, freethinker, after, five, years, concerned, about, his, health, he, returned, to, dorset, settling, in, weymouth, and, decided, to, dedicate, himself, to, writing, in, 1870, while, on, an, architectural, mission, to, restore, the, parish, church, of, st, juliot, in, cornwall, hardy, met, and, fell, in, love, with, emma, gifford, whom, he, married, in, kensington, in, late, 1874, renting, st, david, s, villa, southborough, now, surbiton, for, a, year, in, 1885, thomas, and, his, wife, moved, into, max, gate, in, dorchester, a, house, designed, by, hardy, and, built, by, his, brother, although, they, became, estranged, emma, s, death, in, 1912, had, a, traumatic, effect, on, him, and, after, her, death, hardy, made, a, trip, to, cornwall, to, revisit, places, linked, with, their, courtship, his, poems, 1912, 13, reflect, upon, her, death, in, 1914, hardy, married, his, secretary, florence, emily, dugdale, who, was, 39, years, his, junior, he, remained, preoccupied, with, his, first, wife, s, death, and, tried, to, overcome, his, remorse, by, writing, poetry, in, his, later, years, he, kept, a, wire, fox, terrier, named, wessex, who, was, notoriously, ill, tempered, wessex, s, grave, stone, can, be, found, on, the, max, gate, grounds, in, 1910, hardy, had, been, appointed, a, member, of, the, order, of, merit, and, was, also, for, the, first, time, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, he, was, nominated, again, for, the, prize, 11, years, later, and, received, a, total, of, 25, nominations, until, 1927, he, was, at, least, once, in, 1923, one, of, the, final, candidates, for, the, prize, but, was, not, awarded, hardy, s, interest, in, the, theatre, dated, from, the, 1860s, he, corresponded, with, various, would, be, adapters, over, the, years, including, robert, louis, stevenson, in, 1886, and, jack, grein, and, charles, jarvis, in, the, same, decade, neither, adaptation, came, to, fruition, but, hardy, showed, he, was, potentially, enthusiastic, about, such, a, project, one, play, that, was, performed, however, caused, him, a, certain, amount, of, pain, his, experience, of, the, controversy, and, lukewarm, critical, reception, that, had, surrounded, his, and, comyns, carr, s, adaptation, of, far, from, the, madding, crowd, in, 1882, left, him, wary, of, the, damage, that, adaptations, could, do, to, his, literary, reputation, so, in, 1908, he, so, readily, and, enthusiastically, became, involved, with, a, local, amateur, group, at, the, time, known, as, the, dorchester, dramatic, and, debating, society, but, that, would, become, the, hardy, players, his, reservations, about, adaptations, of, his, novels, meant, he, was, initially, at, some, pains, to, disguise, his, involvement, in, the, play, however, the, international, success, of, the, play, the, trumpet, major, led, to, a, long, and, successful, collaboration, between, hardy, and, the, players, over, the, remaining, years, of, his, life, indeed, his, play, the, famous, tragedy, of, the, queen, of, cornwall, at, tintagel, in, lyonnesse, 1923, was, written, to, be, performed, by, the, hardy, players, from, the, 1880s, hardy, became, increasingly, involved, in, campaigns, to, save, ancient, buildings, from, destruction, or, destructive, modernisation, and, he, became, an, early, member, of, the, society, for, the, protection, of, ancient, buildings, his, correspondence, refers, to, his, unsuccessful, efforts, to, prevent, major, alterations, to, the, parish, church, at, puddletown, close, to, his, home, at, max, gate, he, became, a, frequent, visitor, at, athelhampton, house, which, he, knew, from, his, teenage, years, and, in, his, letters, he, encouraged, the, owner, alfred, cart, de, lafontaine, to, conduct, the, restoration, of, that, building, in, a, sensitive, way, in, 1914, hardy, was, one, of, fifty, three, leading, british, authors, including, h, g, wells, rudyard, kipling, and, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, who, signed, their, names, to, the, authors, declaration, justifying, britain, s, involvement, in, the, first, world, war, this, manifesto, declared, that, the, german, invasion, of, belgium, had, been, a, brutal, crime, and, that, britain, could, not, without, dishonour, have, refused, to, take, part, in, the, present, war, hardy, was, horrified, by, the, destruction, caused, by, the, war, pondering, that, i, do, not, think, a, world, in, which, such, fiendishness, is, possible, to, be, worth, the, saving, and, better, to, let, western, civilization, perish, and, let, the, black, and, yellow, races, have, a, chance, he, wrote, to, john, galsworthy, that, the, exchange, of, international, thought, is, the, only, possible, salvation, for, the, world, shortly, after, helping, to, excavate, the, fordington, mosaic, hardy, became, ill, with, pleurisy, in, december, 1927, and, died, at, max, gate, just, after, 9, pm, on, 11, january, 1928, having, dictated, his, final, poem, to, his, wife, on, his, deathbed, the, cause, of, death, was, cited, on, his, death, certificate, as, cardiac, syncope, with, old, age, given, as, a, contributory, factor, his, funeral, was, on, 16, january, at, westminster, abbey, and, it, proved, a, controversial, occasion, because, hardy, had, wished, for, his, body, to, be, interred, at, stinsford, in, the, same, grave, as, his, first, wife, emma, his, family, and, friends, concurred, however, his, executor, sir, sydney, carlyle, cockerell, insisted, that, he, be, placed, in, the, abbey, s, famous, poets, corner, a, compromise, was, reached, whereby, his, heart, was, buried, at, stinsford, with, emma, and, his, ashes, in, poets, corner, hardy, s, estate, at, death, was, valued, at, 95, 418, equivalent, to, 7, 300, 000, in, 2023, shortly, after, hardy, s, death, the, executors, of, his, estate, burnt, his, letters, and, notebooks, but, twelve, notebooks, survived, one, of, them, containing, notes, and, extracts, of, newspaper, stories, from, the, 1820s, and, research, into, these, has, provided, insight, into, how, hardy, used, them, in, his, works, the, opening, chapter, of, the, mayor, of, casterbridge, for, example, written, in, 1886, was, based, on, press, reports, of, wife, selling, in, the, year, of, his, death, mrs, hardy, published, the, early, life, of, thomas, hardy, 1841, 1891, compiled, largely, from, contemporary, notes, letters, diaries, and, biographical, memoranda, as, well, as, from, oral, information, in, conversations, extending, over, many, years, hardy, s, work, was, admired, by, many, younger, writers, including, d, h, lawrence, john, cowper, powys, and, virginia, woolf, in, his, autobiography, good, bye, to, all, that, 1929, robert, graves, recalls, meeting, hardy, in, dorset, in, the, early, 1920s, and, how, hardy, received, him, and, his, new, wife, warmly, and, was, encouraging, about, his, work, hardy, s, birthplace, in, bockhampton, and, his, house, max, gate, both, in, dorchester, are, owned, by, the, national, trust, hardy, s, first, novel, the, poor, man, and, the, lady, finished, by, 1867, failed, to, find, a, publisher, he, then, showed, it, to, his, mentor, and, friend, the, victorian, poet, and, novelist, george, meredith, who, felt, that, the, poor, man, and, the, lady, would, be, too, politically, controversial, and, might, damage, hardy, s, ability, to, publish, in, the, future, so, hardy, followed, his, advice, and, he, did, not, try, further, to, publish, it, he, subsequently, destroyed, the, manuscript, but, used, some, of, the, ideas, in, his, later, work, in, his, recollections, in, life, and, work, hardy, described, the, book, as, socialistic, not, to, say, revolutionary, yet, not, argumentatively, so, after, he, abandoned, his, first, novel, hardy, wrote, two, new, ones, that, he, hoped, would, have, more, commercial, appeal, desperate, remedies, 1871, and, under, the, greenwood, tree, 1872, both, of, which, were, published, anonymously, it, was, while, working, on, the, latter, that, he, met, emma, gifford, who, would, become, his, wife, in, 1873, a, pair, of, blue, eyes, a, novel, drawing, on, hardy, s, courtship, of, emma, was, published, under, his, own, name, a, plot, device, popularised, by, charles, dickens, the, term, cliffhanger, is, considered, to, have, originated, with, the, serialised, version, of, a, pair, of, blue, eyes, published, in, tinsley, s, magazine, between, september, 1872, and, july, 1873, in, which, henry, knight, one, of, the, protagonists, is, left, literally, hanging, off, a, cliff, elements, of, hardy, s, fiction, reflect, the, influence, of, the, commercially, successful, sensation, fiction, of, the, 1860s, particularly, the, legal, complications, in, novels, such, as, desperate, remedies, 1871, far, from, the, madding, crowd, 1874, and, two, on, a, tower, 1882, in, far, from, the, madding, crowd, hardy, first, introduced, the, idea, of, calling, the, region, in, the, west, of, england, where, his, novels, are, set, wessex, wessex, had, been, the, name, of, an, early, saxon, kingdom, in, approximately, the, same, part, of, england, far, from, the, madding, crowd, was, successful, enough, for, hardy, to, give, up, architectural, work, and, pursue, a, literary, career, over, the, next, 25, years, hardy, produced, 10, more, novels, subsequently, hardy, moved, from, london, to, yeovil, and, then, to, sturminster, newton, where, he, wrote, the, return, of, the, native, 1878, in, 1880, hardy, published, his, only, historical, novel, the, trumpet, major, a, further, move, to, wimborne, saw, hardy, write, two, on, a, tower, published, in, 1882, a, romance, story, set, in, the, world, of, astronomy, then, in, 1885, they, moved, for, the, last, time, to, max, gate, a, house, outside, dorchester, designed, by, hardy, and, built, by, his, brother, there, he, wrote, the, mayor, of, casterbridge, 1886, the, woodlanders, 1887, and, tess, of, the, d, urbervilles, 1891, the, last, of, which, attracted, criticism, for, its, sympathetic, portrayal, of, a, fallen, woman, and, initially, it, was, refused, publication, its, subtitle, a, pure, woman, faithfully, presented, was, intended, to, raise, the, eyebrows, of, the, victorian, middle, classes, jude, the, obscure, published, in, 1895, met, with, an, even, stronger, negative, response, from, the, victorian, public, because, of, its, controversial, treatment, of, sex, religion, and, marriage, its, apparent, attack, on, the, institution, of, marriage, caused, strain, on, hardy, s, already, difficult, marriage, because, emma, hardy, was, concerned, that, jude, the, obscure, would, be, read, as, autobiographical, some, booksellers, sold, the, novel, in, brown, paper, bags, and, walsham, how, the, bishop, of, wakefield, is, reputed, to, have, burnt, his, copy, in, his, postscript, of, 1912, hardy, humorously, referred, to, this, incident, as, part, of, the, career, of, the, book, after, these, verdicts, from, the, press, its, next, misfortune, was, to, be, burnt, by, a, bishop, probably, in, his, despair, at, not, being, able, to, burn, me, despite, this, hardy, had, become, a, celebrity, by, the, 1900s, but, some, argue, that, he, gave, up, writing, novels, because, of, the, criticism, of, both, tess, of, the, d, urbervilles, and, jude, the, obscure, the, well, beloved, first, serialised, in, 1892, was, published, in, 1897, considered, a, victorian, realist, hardy, examines, the, social, constraints, on, the, lives, of, those, living, in, victorian, england, and, criticises, those, beliefs, especially, those, relating, to, marriage, education, and, religion, that, limited, people, s, lives, and, caused, unhappiness, such, unhappiness, and, the, suffering, it, brings, is, seen, by, poet, philip, larkin, as, central, in, hardy, s, works, what, is, the, intensely, maturing, experience, of, which, hardy, s, modern, man, is, most, sensible, in, my, view, it, is, suffering, or, sadness, and, extended, consideration, of, the, centrality, of, suffering, in, hardy, s, work, should, be, the, first, duty, of, the, true, critic, for, which, the, work, is, still, waiting, any, approach, to, his, work, as, to, any, writer, s, work, must, seek, first, of, all, to, determine, what, element, is, peculiarly, his, which, imaginative, note, he, strikes, most, plangently, and, to, deny, that, in, this, case, it, is, the, sometimes, gentle, sometimes, ironic, sometimes, bitter, but, always, passive, apprehension, of, suffering, is, i, think, wrong, headed, in, two, on, a, tower, for, example, hardy, takes, a, stand, against, these, rules, of, society, with, a, story, of, love, that, crosses, the, boundaries, of, class, the, reader, is, forced, to, reconsider, the, conventions, set, up, by, society, for, the, relationships, between, men, and, women, nineteenth, century, society, had, conventions, which, were, enforced, in, this, novel, swithin, st, cleeve, s, idealism, pits, him, against, such, contemporary, social, constraints, in, a, novel, structured, around, contrasts, the, main, opposition, is, between, swithin, st, cleeve, and, lady, viviette, constantine, who, are, presented, as, binary, figures, in, a, series, of, ways, aristocratic, and, lower, class, youthful, and, mature, single, and, married, fair, and, dark, religious, and, agnostic, she, is, also, deeply, conventional, absurdly, wishing, to, conceal, their, marriage, until, swithin, has, achieved, social, status, through, his, scientific, work, which, gives, rise, to, uncontrolled, ironies, and, tragic, comic, misunderstandings, fate, or, chance, is, another, important, theme, hardy, s, characters, often, encounter, crossroads, on, a, journey, a, junction, that, offers, alternative, physical, destinations, but, which, is, also, symbolic, of, a, point, of, opportunity, and, transition, further, suggesting, that, fate, is, at, work, far, from, the, madding, crowd, is, an, example, of, a, novel, in, which, chance, has, a, major, role, had, bathsheba, not, sent, the, valentine, had, fanny, not, missed, her, wedding, for, example, the, story, would, have, taken, an, entirely, different, path, indeed, hardy, s, main, characters, often, seem, to, be, held, in, fate, s, overwhelming, grip, in, 1898, hardy, published, his, first, volume, of, poetry, wessex, poems, a, collection, of, poems, written, over, 30, years, while, some, suggest, that, hardy, gave, up, writing, novels, following, the, harsh, criticism, of, jude, the, obscure, in, 1896, the, poet, c, h, sisson, calls, this, hypothesis, superficial, and, absurd, in, the, twentieth, century, hardy, published, only, poetry, thomas, hardy, published, poems, of, the, past, and, the, present, in, 1901, which, contains, the, darkling, thrush, originally, titled, the, century, s, end, one, of, his, best, known, poems, about, the, turn, of, the, century, thomas, hardy, wrote, in, a, great, variety, of, poetic, forms, including, lyrics, ballads, satire, dramatic, monologues, and, dialogue, as, well, as, a, three, volume, epic, closet, drama, the, dynasts, 1904, 08, and, though, in, some, ways, a, very, traditional, poet, because, he, was, influenced, by, folksong, and, ballads, he, was, never, conventional, and, persistently, experiment, with, different, often, invented, stanza, forms, and, metres, and, made, use, of, rough, hewn, rhythms, and, colloquial, diction, hardy, wrote, a, number, of, significant, war, poems, that, relate, to, both, the, boer, wars, and, world, war, i, including, drummer, hodge, in, time, of, the, breaking, of, nations, and, the, man, he, killed, his, work, had, a, profound, influence, on, other, war, poets, such, as, rupert, brooke, and, siegfried, sassoon, hardy, in, these, poems, often, used, the, viewpoint, of, ordinary, soldiers, and, their, colloquial, speech, a, theme, in, the, wessex, poems, is, the, long, shadow, that, the, napoleonic, wars, cast, over, the, 19th, century, as, seen, for, example, in, the, sergeant, s, song, and, leipzig, the, napoleonic, war, is, the, subject, of, the, dynasts, some, of, hardy, s, more, famous, poems, are, from, poems, 1912, 13, which, later, became, part, of, satires, of, circumstance, 1914, written, following, the, death, of, his, wife, emma, in, 1912, they, had, been, estranged, for, 20, years, and, these, lyric, poems, express, deeply, felt, regret, and, remorse, poems, like, after, a, journey, the, voice, and, others, from, this, collection, are, by, general, consent, regarded, as, the, peak, of, his, poetic, achievement, in, a, 2007, biography, on, hardy, claire, tomalin, argues, that, hardy, became, a, truly, great, english, poet, after, the, death, of, his, first, wife, emma, beginning, with, these, elegies, which, she, describes, as, among, the, finest, and, strangest, celebrations, of, the, dead, in, english, poetry, many, of, hardy, s, poems, deal, with, themes, of, disappointment, in, love, and, life, and, the, perversity, of, fate, but, the, best, of, them, present, these, themes, with, a, carefully, controlled, elegiac, feeling, irony, is, an, important, element, in, a, number, of, hardy, s, poems, including, the, man, he, killed, and, are, you, digging, on, my, grave, a, few, of, hardy, s, poems, such, as, the, blinded, bird, a, melancholy, polemic, against, the, sport, of, vinkenzetting, reflect, his, firm, stance, against, animal, cruelty, exhibited, in, his, antivivisectionist, views, and, his, membership, in, the, royal, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, a, number, of, notable, english, composers, including, gerald, finzi, benjamin, britten, ralph, vaughan, williams, and, gustav, holst, set, poems, by, hardy, to, music, holst, also, wrote, the, orchestral, tone, poem, egdon, heath, a, homage, to, thomas, hardy, in, 1927, although, his, poems, were, initially, not, as, well, received, as, his, novels, had, been, hardy, is, now, recognised, as, one, of, the, great, poets, of, the, 20th, century, and, his, verse, had, a, profound, influence, on, later, writers, including, robert, frost, w, h, auden, dylan, thomas, and, philip, larkin, larkin, included, 27, poems, by, hardy, compared, with, only, nine, by, t, s, eliot, in, his, edition, of, the, oxford, book, of, twentieth, century, english, verse, in, 1973, there, were, fewer, poems, by, w, b, yeats, poet, critic, donald, davie, s, thomas, hardy, and, english, poetry, considers, hardy, s, contribution, to, ongoing, poetic, tradition, at, length, and, in, creative, depth, davie, s, friend, thom, gunn, also, wrote, on, hardy, and, acknowledged, his, stature, and, example, hardy, s, family, was, anglican, but, not, especially, devout, he, was, baptised, at, the, age, of, five, weeks, and, attended, church, where, his, father, and, uncle, contributed, to, music, he, did, not, attend, the, local, church, of, england, school, instead, being, sent, to, mr, last, s, school, three, miles, away, as, a, young, adult, he, befriended, henry, r, bastow, a, plymouth, brethren, man, who, also, worked, as, a, pupil, architect, and, who, was, preparing, for, adult, baptism, in, the, baptist, church, hardy, flirted, with, conversion, but, decided, against, it, bastow, went, to, australia, and, maintained, a, long, correspondence, with, hardy, but, eventually, hardy, tired, of, these, exchanges, and, the, correspondence, ceased, this, concluded, hardy, s, links, with, the, baptists, the, irony, and, struggles, of, life, coupled, with, his, naturally, curious, mind, led, him, to, question, the, traditional, christian, view, of, god, the, christian, god, the, external, personality, has, been, replaced, by, the, intelligence, of, the, first, cause, the, replacement, of, the, old, concept, of, god, as, all, powerful, by, a, new, concept, of, universal, consciousness, the, tribal, god, man, shaped, fiery, faced, and, tyrannous, is, replaced, by, the, unconscious, will, of, the, universe, which, progressively, grows, aware, of, itself, and, ultimately, it, is, to, be, hoped, sympathetic, scholars, have, debated, hardy, s, religious, leanings, for, years, often, unable, to, reach, a, consensus, once, when, asked, in, correspondence, by, a, clergyman, dr, a, b, grosart, about, the, question, of, reconciling, the, horrors, of, human, and, animal, life, with, the, absolute, goodness, and, non, limitation, of, god, hardy, replied, mr, hardy, regrets, that, he, is, unable, to, offer, any, hypothesis, which, would, reconcile, the, existence, of, such, evils, as, dr, grosart, describes, with, the, idea, of, omnipotent, goodness, perhaps, dr, grosart, might, be, helped, to, a, provisional, view, of, the, universe, by, the, recently, published, life, of, darwin, and, the, works, of, herbert, spencer, and, other, agnostics, hardy, frequently, conceived, of, and, wrote, about, supernatural, forces, particularly, those, that, control, the, universe, through, indifference, or, caprice, a, force, he, called, the, immanent, will, he, also, showed, in, his, writing, some, degree, of, fascination, with, ghosts, and, spirits, even, so, he, retained, a, strong, emotional, attachment, to, the, christian, liturgy, and, church, rituals, particularly, as, manifested, in, rural, communities, that, had, been, such, a, formative, influence, in, his, early, years, and, biblical, references, can, be, found, woven, throughout, many, of, hardy, s, novels, hardy, s, friends, during, his, apprenticeship, to, john, hicks, included, horace, moule, one, of, the, eight, sons, of, henry, moule, and, the, poet, william, barnes, both, ministers, of, religion, moule, remained, a, close, friend, of, hardy, s, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, introduced, him, to, new, scientific, findings, that, cast, doubt, on, literal, interpretations, of, the, bible, such, as, those, of, gideon, mantell, moule, gave, hardy, a, copy, of, mantell, s, book, the, wonders, of, geology, 1848, in, 1858, and, adelene, buckland, has, suggested, that, there, are, compelling, similarities, between, the, cliffhanger, section, from, a, pair, of, blue, eyes, and, mantell, s, geological, descriptions, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, character, of, henry, knight, in, a, pair, of, blue, eyes, was, based, on, horace, moule, throughout, his, life, hardy, sought, a, rationale, for, believing, in, an, afterlife, or, a, timeless, existence, turning, first, to, spiritualists, such, as, henri, bergson, and, then, to, albert, einstein, and, j, m, e, mctaggart, considering, their, philosophy, on, time, and, space, in, relation, to, immortality, sites, associated, with, hardy, s,

and, lawrence, s, own, response, to, the, central, metaphysic, behind, many, of, hardy, s, novels, helped, significantly, in, the, development, of, the, rainbow, 1915, and, women, in, love, 1920,
