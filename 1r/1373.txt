universit, de, montr, al, in, his, obituary, the, economist, described, trudeau, as, parochial, as, a, young, man, who, dismissed, the, second, world, war, as, a, squabble, between, the, big, powers, although, he, later, regretted, missing, one, of, the, major, events, of, the, century, in, his, 1993, memoir, trudeau, wrote, that, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, september, 1939, and, his,

battle, of, britain, and, the, london, blitz, he, wrote, that, in, the, early, 1940s, when, he, was, in, his, early, twenties, he, thought, so, there, was, a, war, tough, it, wouldn, t, stop, me, from, concentrating, on, my, studies, so, long, as, that, was, possible, f, you, were, a, french, canadian, in, montreal, you, did, not, automatically, believe, that, this, was, a, just, war, in, montreal, in, the, early, 1940s, we, still, knew, nothing, about, the, holocaust, and, we, tended, to, think, of, this, war, as, a, settling, of, scores, among, the, superpowers, young, trudeau, opposed, conscription, for, overseas, service, and, in, 1942, he, campaigned, for, the, anti, conscription, candidate, jean, drapeau, later, the, mayor, of, montreal, in, outremont, trudeau, described, a, speech, he, heard, in, montreal, by, ernest, lapointe, minister, of, justice, and, prime, minister, william, lyon, mackenzie, king, s, quebec, lieutenant, lapointe, had, been, a, liberal, mp, during, the, 1917, conscription, crisis, in, which, the, canadian, government, had, deployed, up, to, 1, 200, soldiers, to, suppress, the, anti, conscription, easter, riots, in, quebec, city, in, march, and, april, 1918, in, a, final, and, bloody, conflict, armed, rioters, fired, on, the, troops, and, the, soldiers, returned, fire, at, least, five, men, were, killed, by, gunfire, and, there, were, over, 150, casualties, and, 300, 000, in, damage, 504, 60, in, 1939, it, was, lapointe, who, helped, draft, the, liberals, policy, against, conscription, for, service, overseas, lapointe, was, aware, that, a, new, conscription, crisis, would, destroy, the, national, unity, that, mackenzie, king, had, been, trying, to, build, since, the, end, of, world, war, i, trudeau, believed, lapointe, had, lied, and, broken, his, promise, his, criticisms, of, king, s, wartime, policies, such, as, suspension, of, habeas, corpus, the, farce, of, bilingualism, and, french, canadian, advancement, in, the, army, and, the, forced, voluntary, enrolment, was, scathing, as, a, university, student, trudeau, joined, the, canadian, officers, training, corps, cotc, which, trained, at, the, local, armoury, in, montreal, during, the, school, term, and, undertook, further, training, at, camp, farnham, each, summer, although, the, national, resources, mobilization, act, enacted, in, 1940, originally, provided, that, conscripts, could, not, be, required, to, serve, outside, of, canada, in, 1942, parliament, amended, the, act, and, removed, that, restriction, the, conscription, crisis, of, 1944, arose, in, response, to, the, invasion, of, normandy, in, june, 1944, trudeau, continued, his, full, time, studies, in, law, at, the, universit, de, montr, al, while, in, the, cotc, from, 1940, until, his, graduation, in, 1943, following, his, graduation, he, articled, for, a, year, and, in, the, fall, of, 1944, began, his, masters, in, political, economy, at, harvard, university, s, graduate, school, of, public, administration, now, the, john, f, kennedy, school, of, government, in, his, memoir, he, admitted, that, it, was, at, harvard, s, super, informed, environment, that, he, realized, the, historic, importance, of, the, war, and, that, he, had, missed, one, of, the, major, events, of, the, century, in, which, was, living, harvard, had, become, a, major, intellectual, centre, as, fascism, in, europe, led, to, a, great, migration, of, intellectuals, to, the, united, states, trudeau, s, harvard, dissertation, was, on, the, topic, of, communism, and, christianity, at, harvard, an, american, and, predominantly, protestant, university, trudeau, a, french, canadian, catholic, living, outside, the, province, of, quebec, for, the, first, time, felt, like, an, outsider, as, his, sense, of, isolation, deepened, he, decided, in, 1947, to, continue, his, work, on, his, harvard, dissertation, in, paris, where, he, studied, at, the, institut, d, tudes, politiques, de, paris, sciences, po, the, harvard, dissertation, remained, unfinished, when, trudeau, briefly, entered, a, doctoral, program, to, study, under, the, socialist, economist, harold, laski, at, the, london, school, of, economics, lse, this, cemented, trudeau, s, belief, that, keynesian, economics, and, social, sciences, were, essential, to, the, creation, of, the, good, life, in, a, democratic, society, over, a, five, week, period, he, attended, many, lectures, and, became, a, follower, of, personalism, after, being, influenced, most, notably, by, emmanuel, mounier, he, also, was, influenced, by, nikolai, berdyaev, particularly, his, book, slavery, and, freedom, max, and, monique, nemni, argue, that, berdyaev, s, book, influenced, trudeau, s, rejection, of, nationalism, and, separatism, in, the, summer, of, 1948, trudeau, embarked, on, world, travels, to, find, a, sense, of, purpose, at, the, age, of, twenty, eight, he, travelled, to, poland, where, he, visited, auschwitz, then, czechoslovakia, austria, hungary, yugoslavia, bulgaria, and, the, middle, east, including, turkey, jordan, and, southern, iraq, although, he, was, wealthy, trudeau, travelled, with, a, back, pack, in, self, imposed, hardship, he, used, his, british, passport, instead, of, his, canadian, passport, in, his, travels, through, pakistan, india, china, and, japan, often, wearing, local, clothing, to, blend, in, according, to, the, economist, when, trudeau, returned, to, canada, in, 1949, after, an, absence, of, five, months, his, mind, was, seemingly, broadened, from, his, studies, at, harvard, sciences, po, and, the, lse, as, well, as, his, travels, he, was, appalled, at, the, narrow, nationalism, in, his, native, french, speaking, quebec, and, the, authoritarianism, of, the, province, s, government, beginning, while, trudeau, was, travelling, overseas, several, events, took, place, in, quebec, that, were, precursors, to, the, quiet, revolution, these, included, the, 1948, release, of, the, anti, establishment, manifesto, refus, global, the, publication, of, les, insolences, du, fr, re, untel, the, 1949, asbestos, strike, and, the, 1955, richard, riot, artists, and, intellectuals, in, quebec, signed, the, refus, global, on, august, 9, 1948, in, opposition, to, the, repressive, rule, of, quebec, premier, maurice, duplessis, and, the, decadent, social, establishment, in, quebec, including, the, catholic, church, when, he, returned, to, montreal, in, 1949, trudeau, quickly, became, a, leading, figure, opposing, duplessis, s, rule, trudeau, actively, supported, the, workers, in, the, asbestos, strike, who, opposed, duplessis, in, 1949, trudeau, was, the, co, founder, and, editor, of, cit, libre, a, dissident, journal, that, helped, provide, the, intellectual, basis, for, the, quiet, revolution, in, 1956, he, edited, an, important, book, on, the, subject, la, gr, ve, de, l, amiante, which, argued, that, the, asbestos, miners, strike, of, 1949, was, a, seminal, event, in, quebec, s, history, marking, the, beginning, of, resistance, to, the, conservative, francophone, clerical, establishment, and, anglophone, business, class, that, had, long, ruled, the, province, because, of, trudeau, s, labour, union, activities, in, asbestos, duplessis, blacklisted, him, and, he, was, unable, to, teach, law, at, the, universit, de, montr, al, he, surprised, his, closest, friends, in, quebec, when, he, became, a, civil, servant, in, ottawa, in, 1949, until, 1951, he, worked, in, the, privy, council, office, of, the, liberal, prime, minister, louis, st, laurent, as, an, economic, policy, advisor, he, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, he, found, this, period, very, useful, when, he, entered, politics, later, on, and, that, senior, civil, servant, norman, robertson, tried, unsuccessfully, to, persuade, him, to, stay, on, trudeau, s, progressive, values, and, his, close, ties, with, co, operative, commonwealth, federation, ccf, intellectuals, including, f, r, scott, eugene, forsey, michael, kelway, oliver, and, charles, taylor, led, to, his, support, of, and, membership, in, that, federal, democratic, socialist, party, throughout, the, 1950s, an, associate, professor, of, law, at, the, universit, de, montr, al, from, 1961, to, 1965, trudeau, s, views, evolved, towards, a, liberal, position, in, favour, of, individual, rights, counter, to, the, state, and, made, him, an, opponent, of, quebec, nationalism, he, admired, the, labour, unions, which, were, tied, to, the, cooperative, commonwealth, federation, ccf, and, tried, to, infuse, his, liberal, party, with, some, of, their, reformist, zeal, by, the, late, 1950s, trudeau, began, to, reject, social, democratic, and, labour, parties, arguing, that, they, should, put, their, narrow, goals, aside, and, join, forces, with, liberals, to, fight, for, democracy, first, in, economic, theory, he, was, influenced, by, professors, joseph, schumpeter, and, john, kenneth, galbraith, while, he, was, at, harvard, in, 1963, trudeau, criticized, the, liberal, party, of, lester, pearson, when, it, supported, arming, bomarc, missiles, in, canada, with, nuclear, warheads, trudeau, was, offered, a, position, at, queen, s, university, teaching, political, science, by, james, corry, who, later, became, principal, of, queen, s, but, turned, it, down, because, he, preferred, to, teach, in, quebec, in, 1965, trudeau, joined, the, liberal, party, along, with, his, friends, g, rard, pelletier, and, jean, marchand, dubbed, the, three, wise, men, by, the, media, they, ran, successfully, for, the, liberals, in, the, 1965, election, trudeau, himself, was, elected, in, the, safe, liberal, riding, of, mount, royal, in, montreal, he, would, hold, this, seat, until, his, retirement, from, politics, in, 1984, winning, each, election, with, large, majorities, his, decision, to, join, the, liberals, rather, than, the, ccf, s, successor, the, new, democratic, party, ndp, was, partly, based, on, his, belief, that, the, federal, ndp, could, not, achieve, power, he, also, doubted, the, feasibility, of, the, ndp, s, centralizing, policies, and, felt, that, the, party, leadership, tended, toward, a, deux, nations, approach, he, could, not, support, upon, arrival, in, ottawa, trudeau, was, appointed, as, parliamentary, secretary, to, prime, minister, lester, b, pearson, and, spent, much, of, the, next, year, travelling, abroad, representing, canada, at, international, meetings, and, bodies, including, the, united, nations, in, 1967, he, was, appointed, to, pearson, s, cabinet, as, minister, of, justice, and, attorney, general, as, justice, minister, and, attorney, general, trudeau, was, responsible, for, introducing, the, landmark, criminal, law, amendment, act, an, omnibus, bill, whose, provisions, included, among, other, things, the, decriminalization, of, homosexual, acts, between, consenting, adults, new, gun, ownership, restrictions, and, the, legalization, of, contraception, abortion, and, lotteries, as, well, as, the, authorization, of, breathalyzer, tests, on, suspected, drunk, drivers, trudeau, famously, defended, the, segment, of, the, bill, decriminalizing, homosexual, acts, by, telling, reporters, that, there, s, no, place, for, the, state, in, the, bedrooms, of, the, nation, adding, that, what, s, done, in, private, between, adults, doesn, t, concern, the, criminal, code, trudeau, paraphrased, the, term, from, martin, o, malley, s, editorial, piece, in, the, globe, and, mail, on, december, 12, 1967, trudeau, also, liberalized, divorce, laws, and, clashed, with, quebec, premier, daniel, johnson, sr, during, constitutional, negotiations, at, the, end, of, canada, s, centennial, year, in, 1967, pearson, announced, his, intention, to, step, down, and, trudeau, entered, the, race, to, succeed, him, as, party, leader, and, prime, minister, his, energetic, campaign, attracted, widespread, media, attention, and, mobilized, many, young, people, who, saw, trudeau, as, a, symbol, of, generational, change, however, many, liberals, still, had, reservations, given, that, he, had, only, joined, the, party, in, 1965, during, the, convention, prominent, cabinet, minister, judy, lamarsh, was, caught, on, television, profanely, stating, that, trudeau, was, not, a, liberal, nevertheless, at, the, april, 1968, liberal, leadership, convention, trudeau, was, elected, leader, on, the, fourth, ballot, with, the, support, of, 51, percent, of, the, delegates, he, defeated, several, prominent, and, long, serving, liberals, including, paul, martin, sr, robert, winters, and, paul, hellyer, as, the, new, leader, of, the, governing, liberals, trudeau, was, sworn, in, as, prime, minister, on, april, 20, though, the, term, of, the, parliament, was, not, due, to, expire, until, november, 1970, pearson, s, government, had, almost, fallen, before, the, leadership, contest, could, even, take, place, after, a, tax, bill, was, voted, down, in, parliament, leading, to, much, confusion, over, whether, this, counted, as, a, matter, of, confidence, in, the, government, governor, general, roland, michener, ultimately, ruled, that, it, did, not, and, the, government, subsequently, won, an, actual, confidence, motion, but, the, incident, made, it, clear, that, the, minority, government, trudeau, had, inherited, would, not, realistically, last, the, full, parliamentary, term, and, that, he, would, soon, need, to, call, an, early, election, in, order, to, win, a, parliamentary, majority, trudeau, eventually, called, this, election, for, june, 25, 1968, trudeau, s, campaign, benefited, from, an, unprecedented, wave, of, personal, popularity, called, trudeaumania, which, saw, him, mobbed, by, throngs, of, youths, his, main, national, opponents, were, pc, leader, robert, stanfield, and, ndp, leader, tommy, douglas, both, popular, figures, who, had, respectively, been, premiers, of, nova, scotia, and, saskatchewan, albeit, in, trudeau, s, native, quebec, the, main, competition, to, the, liberals, was, from, the, ralliement, cr, ditiste, led, by, r, al, caouette, as, a, candidate, trudeau, espoused, participatory, democracy, as, a, means, of, making, canada, a, just, society, he, vigorously, defended, the, newly, implemented, universal, health, care, and, regional, development, programmes, as, well, as, the, recent, reforms, found, in, the, omnibus, bill, on, the, eve, of, the, election, during, the, annual, saint, jean, baptiste, day, parade, in, montreal, rioting, quebec, sovereigntists, threw, rocks, and, bottles, at, the, grandstand, where, trudeau, was, seated, chanting, trudeau, au, poteau, trudeau, to, the, stake, rejecting, the, pleas, of, aides, that, he, take, cover, trudeau, stayed, in, his, seat, facing, the, rioters, without, any, sign, of, fear, the, image, of, the, defiant, prime, minister, impressed, the, public, the, next, day, trudeau, handily, won, the, 1968, election, with, a, strong, majority, government, this, was, the, liberals, first, majority, since, 1953, trudeau, s, first, major, legislative, push, was, implementing, the, majority, of, recommendations, from, pearson, s, royal, commission, on, bilingualism, and, biculturalism, via, the, official, languages, act, which, made, french, and, english, the, co, equal, official, languages, of, the, federal, government, more, controversial, than, the, declaration, which, was, backed, by, the, ndp, and, with, some, opposition, in, caucus, the, pcs, was, the, implementation, of, the, act, s, principles, between, 1966, and, 1976, the, francophone, proportion, of, the, civil, service, and, military, doubled, causing, alarm, in, some, sections, of, anglophone, canada, who, felt, they, were, being, disadvantaged, trudeau, s, cabinet, fulfilled, part, iv, of, the, royal, commission, s, report, by, announcing, a, multiculturalism, policy, on, october, 8, 1971, it, was, the, first, of, its, kind, in, the, world, subsequently, being, emulated, by, several, provinces, such, as, alberta, saskatchewan, and, manitoba, even, other, countries, most, notably, australia, which, has, had, a, similar, history, and, immigration, pattern, emulated, the, policy, beyond, the, specifics, of, the, policy, itself, this, action, signalled, an, openness, to, the, world, and, coincided, with, a, more, open, immigration, policy, that, pearson, had, brought, in, the, policy, recognized, that, while, canada, was, a, country, of, two, official, languages, it, recognized, a, plurality, of, cultures, a, multicultural, policy, within, a, bilingual, framework, this, annoyed, public, opinion, in, quebec, which, believed, that, it, challenged, quebec, s, claim, of, canada, being, a, country, of, two, nations, following, the, vietnam, war, a, refugee, crisis, was, caused, by, the, flight, of, the, boat, people, from, vietnam, as, thousands, of, people, mostly, ethnic, chinese, fled, the, country, in, makeshift, boats, across, the, south, china, sea, usually, to, the, british, colony, of, hong, kong, the, trudeau, government, was, generous, in, granting, asylum, to, the, refugees, by, 1980, canada, had, accepted, about, 44, 000, of, the, boat, people, making, it, one, of, the, top, destinations, for, them, in, 1969, trudeau, along, with, his, then, minister, of, indian, affairs, jean, chr, tien, proposed, the, 1969, white, paper, officially, entitled, statement, of, the, government, of, canada, on, indian, policy, the, paper, proposed, the, general, assimilation, of, first, nations, into, the, canadian, body, politic, through, the, elimination, of, the, indian, act, and, indian, status, the, parcelling, of, reserve, land, to, private, owners, and, the, elimination, of, the, department, of, indian, and, northern, affairs, the, white, paper, was, widely, seen, as, racist, and, an, attack, on, canada, s, indigenous, peoples, and, prompted, the, first, major, national, mobilization, of, indigenous, activists, against, the, federal, government, s, proposal, leading, trudeau, to, set, aside, the, legislation, on, july, 14, 1976, after, a, long, and, emotional, debate, bill, c, 84, was, passed, by, the, house, of, commons, by, a, vote, of, 130, to, 124, abolishing, the, death, penalty, completely, and, instituting, a, life, sentence, without, parole, for, 25, years, for, first, degree, murder, trudeau, s, first, serious, test, as, prime, minister, came, during, the, october, crisis, of, 1970, when, a, marxist, influenced, quebec, separatist, group, the, front, de, lib, ration, du, qu, bec, flq, kidnapped, british, trade, consul, james, cross, at, his, residence, on, october, 5, five, days, later, the, group, also, kidnapped, quebec, labour, minister, pierre, laporte, trudeau, with, the, acquiescence, of, quebec, premier, robert, bourassa, responded, by, invoking, the, war, measures, act, which, gave, the, government, sweeping, powers, of, arrest, and, detention, without, trial, trudeau, presented, a, determined, public, stance, during, the, crisis, when, questioned, by, cbc, television, journalist, tim, ralfe, regarding, how, far, he, would, go, to, stop, the, violence, trudeau, answered, just, watch, me, laporte, was, found, dead, on, october, 17, in, the, trunk, of, a, car, the, cause, of, his, death, is, still, debated, five, of, the, flq, members, were, flown, to, cuba, in, 1970, as, part, of, a, deal, in, exchange, for, james, cross, life, although, they, eventually, returned, to, canada, years, later, where, they, served, time, in, prison, although, this, response, is, still, controversial, and, was, opposed, at, the, time, as, excessive, by, parliamentarians, like, tommy, douglas, and, david, lewis, it, was, met, with, only, limited, objections, from, the, public, after, consultations, with, the, provincial, premiers, trudeau, agreed, to, attend, a, conference, called, by, british, columbia, premier, w, a, c, bennett, to, attempt, to, finally, patriate, the, canadian, constitution, negotiations, between, the, provinces, and, justice, minister, john, turner, created, a, draft, agreement, known, as, the, victoria, charter, that, entrenched, a, charter, of, rights, bilingualism, and, a, guarantee, of, a, veto, of, constitutional, amendments, for, ontario, and, quebec, as, well, as, regional, vetoes, for, western, canada, and, atlantic, canada, within, the, new, constitution, the, agreement, was, acceptable, to, the, nine, predominantly, english, speaking, provinces, but, quebec, s, premier, robert, bourassa, requested, two, weeks, to, consult, with, his, cabinet, after, a, strong, backlash, of, popular, opinion, against, the, agreement, in, quebec, bourassa, stated, quebec, would, not, accept, it, trudeau, faced, increasing, challenges, in, quebec, starting, with, bitter, relations, with, bourassa, and, his, quebec, liberal, government, following, a, rise, in, the, polls, after, the, rejection, of, the, victoria, charter, the, quebec, liberals, had, taken, a, more, confrontational, approach, with, the, federal, government, on, the, constitution, french, language, laws, and, the, language, of, air, traffic, control, in, quebec, trudeau, responded, with, increasing, anger, at, what, he, saw, as, nationalist, provocations, against, ottawa, s, bilingualism, and, constitutional, initiatives, at, times, expressing, his, personal, contempt, for, bourassa, partially, in, an, attempt, to, shore, up, his, support, bourassa, called, a, surprise, election, in, 1976, that, resulted, in, ren, l, vesque, and, the, sovereigntist, parti, qu, b, cois, pq, winning, a, majority, government, the, pq, had, chiefly, campaigned, on, a, good, government, platform, but, promised, a, referendum, on, independence, to, be, held, within, their, first, mandate, trudeau, and, l, vesque, had, been, personal, rivals, with, trudeau, s, intellectualism, contrasting, with, l, vesque, s, more, working, class, image, while, trudeau, claimed, to, welcome, the, clarity, provided, by, the, pq, victory, the, unexpected, rise, of, the, quebec, sovereignty, movement, became, in, his, view, his, biggest, challenge, as, the, pq, began, to, take, power, trudeau, faced, the, prolonged, breakdown, of, his, marriage, which, the, english, language, press, covered, in, lurid, detail, on, a, day, by, day, basis, trudeau, s, reserve, was, seen, as, dignified, by, contemporaries, and, his, poll, numbers, actually, rose, during, the, height, of, coverage, but, aides, felt, the, personal, tensions, left, him, uncharacteristically, emotional, and, prone, to, outbursts, trudeau, s, first, government, implemented, many, procedural, reforms, to, make, parliament, and, the, liberal, caucus, meetings, run, more, efficiently, significantly, expanded, the, size, and, role, of, the, prime, minister, s, office, and, substantially, expanded, social, welfare, programs, trudeau, s, government, ran, large, budget, deficits, throughout, its, time, in, office, the, government, s, first, budget, in, 1968, produced, a, deficit, of, 667, million, while, the, 1969, budget, produced, a, surplus, of, 140, million, however, the, 1970, budget, which, produced, a, deficit, of, over, 1, billion, marked, the, start, of, consecutive, budget, deficits, run, by, the, trudeau, government, the, budget, would, not, be, balanced, until, 1997, by, the, time, trudeau, s, first, tenure, ended, in, 1979, the, deficit, grew, to, 12, billion, in, 1971, trudeau, s, government, greatly, expanded, unemployment, insurance, making, coverage, nearly, universal, as, coverage, for, the, canadian, labour, force, jumped, to, 96, percent, from, 75, percent, the, system, was, sometimes, called, the, 8, 42, because, one, had, to, work, for, eight, weeks, with, at, least, 20, hours, per, week, and, wait, two, weeks, to, get, benefits, for, the, other, 42, weeks, of, the, year, this, expansion, also, opened, the, ui, program, up, to, maternity, sickness, and, retirement, benefits, covered, seasonal, workers, for, the, first, time, and, allowed, mothers, to, receive, up, to, 15, weeks, of, benefits, if, they, had, 20, or, more, insurable, weeks, the, reforms, increased, the, maximum, benefit, period, to, 50, weeks, though, the, benefit, duration, was, calculated, using, a, complex, formula, depending, on, labour, force, participation, and, the, regional, and, national, unemployment, rates, in, 1977, the, government, simplified, the, benefit, duration, formula, but, introduced, a, variable, entrance, requirement, dependent, on, the, unemployment, rate, in, the, applicant, s, region, the, changes, also, mandated, that, workers, in, areas, with, low, unemployment, regions, work, twice, as, long, to, be, eligible, for, benefits, as, workers, in, high, unemployment, regions, in, 1973, trudeau, s, government, amended, the, national, housing, act, to, provide, financial, assistance, for, new, home, buying, loans, for, co, operative, housing, and, low, interest, loans, for, municipal, and, private, non, profit, housing, the, amendments, saw, the, introduction, the, rental, rehabilitation, assistance, program, which, established, that, homeowners, and, occupants, in, low, income, neighborhoods, could, qualify, for, small, grants, to, be, used, for, home, repair, also, introduced, was, the, assisted, home, ownership, program, which, allowed, the, canada, mortgage, and, housing, corporation, cmhc, to, start, providing, grants, and, subsidized, interest, rates, to, low, income, families, though, in, 1978, an, amendment, discontinued, the, provision, of, grant, money, to, these, families, which, led, to, a, high, incidence, of, defaults, and, in, turn, necessitated, that, the, federal, government, provide, financial, assistance, to, the, cmhc, the, amendments, saw, the, passage, of, the, rent, supplement, act, which, enabled, the, cmhc, to, partner, with, private, landlords, cooperatives, and, not, for, profit, associations, to, provide, affordable, housing, in, addition, the, act, saw, the, cmhc, agree, to, fund, the, difference, between, market, rental, prices, and, rent, prices, geared, to, the, specific, occupant, s, income, lastly, the, canada, rental, supply, program, was, introduced, to, provide, interest, free, loans, for, 15, years, to, developers, who, agreed, to, allocate, a, proportion, of, units, toward, social, housing, initiatives, in, order, to, ensure, that, loans, contributed, to, the, provision, of, low, income, housing, the, cmhc, was, restricted, to, giving, loans, amounting, to, 7500, or, less, per, unit, the, registered, home, ownership, savings, plan, rhosp, was, introduced, in, the, government, s, november, 1974, budget, similar, to, rrsps, proceeds, from, the, rhosp, could, be, received, tax, free, for, either, a, down, payment, for, the, acquisition, of, an, owner, occupied, dwelling, or, to, buy, furnitures, for, the, dwelling, or, the, spouse, s, dwelling, individuals, who, already, owned, a, home, either, owner, occupied, or, rented, to, another, person, could, not, deduct, rhosp, contributions, in, 1976, trudeau, s, government, allowed, for, transfers, of, funds, between, the, rhosp, for, instance, to, select, a, plan, with, better, returns, in, 1977, the, government, tightened, the, rules, of, the, rhosp, the, reforms, removed, the, purchase, of, furnitures, from, the, list, of, usage, allowed, for, tax, free, use, of, rhosp, proceeds, starting, in, 1978, disallowed, deductible, contributions, for, a, taxpayer, whose, spouse, owned, a, home, suspended, tax, free, rollover, of, rhsop, funds, to, an, rrsp, and, capped, the, lifetime, of, the, rhosp, at, 20, years, in, 1977, trudeau, s, government, established, the, financial, program, established, programs, financing, to, help, finance, the, provincially, run, healthcare, and, post, secondary, education, system, through, transfer, payments, by, cash, and, tax, points, this, system, lasted, until, 1995, in, 1979, trudeau, s, government, restructured, family, allowances, by, increasing, the, role, of, the, tax, system, in, child, support, and, decreasing, the, role, of, family, allowances, the, government, established, an, annual, refundable, child, tax, credit, of, 200, for, families, with, incomes, of, 18, 000, or, less, as, incomes, increased, above, this, level, benefits, would, be, taxed, away, to, disappear, completely, at, 26, 000, since, the, median, income, for, families, during, this, time, was, 19, 500, the, majority, of, families, received, some, benefit, from, the, new, program, in, 1969, trudeau, s, first, finance, minister, edgar, benson, introduced, a, white, paper, on, tax, reform, which, included, tax, deductions, for, child, care, and, advocated, shifting, the, tax, burden, from, the, poor, to, the, wealthy, measures, to, fulfill, the, latter, proposal, included, a, capital, gains, tax, which, was, severely, criticized, by, corporate, canada, and, the, business, community, notably, israel, asper, the, bill, was, debated, in, parliament, for, over, a, year, with, its, more, radical, proposals, being, removed, in, parliamentary, committee, the, reforms, managed, to, be, passed, through, the, use, of, closure, with, the, capital, gains, tax, that, had, an, inclusion, rate, of, 50, percent, coming, into, effect, on, january, 1, 1972, as, prescribed, by, the, 1971, budget, also, implemented, in, 1972, was, the, child, care, expense, deduction, which, allowed, for, a, deduction, of, up, to, 500, per, child, as, benson, had, now, become, a, political, liability, trudeau, replaced, him, with, john, turner, who, was, seen, as, a, business, liberal, in, 1972, in, 1973, trudeau, s, government, fully, indexed, the, person, income, tax, system, both, the, exemptions, and, the, brackets, to, match, inflation, the, indexation, was, made, effective, in, 1974, during, that, year, inflation, had, jumped, from, six, percent, to, double, digits, the, government, also, implemented, three, personal, income, tax, cuts, from, 1973, to, 1975, while, popular, with, the, electorate, trudeau, s, promised, minor, reforms, had, little, effect, on, the, growing, rate, of, inflation, and, he, struggled, with, conflicting, advice, on, the, crisis, in, september, 1975, finance, minister, john, turner, resigned, over, refusing, to, implement, wage, and, price, controls, in, december, 1975, in, an, embarrassing, about, face, trudeau, and, new, finance, minister, donald, macdonald, introduced, wage, and, price, controls, by, passing, the, anti, inflation, act, despite, campaigning, against, them, in, the, 1974, election, amongst, its, many, controls, it, limited, pay, increases, for, federal, government, employees, and, employees, in, companies, with, over, 500, workers, to, 10, percent, in, 1976, 8, percent, in, 1977, and, 6, percent, in, 1978, the, act, also, established, the, anti, inflation, board, which, oversaw, the, implementation, of, wage, and, price, controls, and, had, the, ability, to, recommend, decreases, in, prices, of, goods, wage, cuts, and, rebates, to, customers, of, various, services, the, breadth, of, the, legislation, which, touched, on, many, powers, traditionally, considered, the, purview, of, the, provinces, prompted, a, supreme, court, reference, that, only, upheld, the, legislation, as, an, emergency, requiring, federal, intervention, under, the, british, north, america, act, during, the, annual, 1975, christmas, interview, with, ctv, trudeau, discussed, the, economy, citing, market, failures, and, stating, that, more, state, intervention, would, be, necessary, however, the, academic, wording, and, hypothetical, solutions, posed, during, the, complex, discussion, led, much, of, the, public, to, believe, he, had, declared, capitalism, itself, a, failure, creating, a, lasting, distrust, among, increasingly, neoliberal, business, leaders, the, controls, lasted, until, 1978, and, the, anti, inflation, board, was, dissolved, in, 1979, on, september, 4, 1973, trudeau, requested, that, the, western, canadian, provinces, agree, to, a, voluntary, freeze, on, oil, prices, during, the, ongoing, arab, oil, embargo, nine, days, later, the, trudeau, government, imposed, a, 40, cent, tax, on, every, barrel, of, canadian, oil, exported, to, the, united, states, to, combat, rising, inflation, and, oil, prices, the, tax, was, equivalent, to, the, difference, between, domestic, and, international, oil, prices, and, the, revenues, were, used, to, subsidize, oil, imports, for, eastern, refiners, the, premier, of, oil, rich, alberta, peter, lougheed, called, the, decision, the, most, discriminatory, action, taken, by, a, federal, government, against, a, particular, province, in, the, entire, history, of, confederation, while, revenues, decreased, for, western, provinces, particularly, alberta, and, for, the, petroleum, industry, trudeau, s, government, subsidized, eastern, consumers, angering, alberta, who, successfully, fought, for, control, of, its, natural, resources, in, 1930, in, the, early, 1970s, the, petroleum, industry, was, largely, under, foreign, mainly, american, control, the, recent, discovery, of, oil, in, alaska, put, corporate, pressure, on, the, canadian, arctic, and, canada, s, energy, sector, increasingly, focused, on, north, american, rather, than, domestic, needs, trudeau, s, government, initially, rejected, the, idea, of, creating, a, nationalized, oil, company, which, was, perceived, to, secure, supplies, improve, revenue, collection, and, give, governments, better, information, on, the, global, energy, market, arguing, it, would, be, costly, and, inefficient, however, after, the, late, 1973, oil, crisis, saw, global, oil, prices, quadruple, questions, arose, about, whether, canada, should, continue, importing, oil, though, canada, also, exported, oil, at, times, the, provinces, of, quebec, and, atlantic, canada, were, at, risk, of, a, cut, off, of, imports, as, a, result, canada, was, in, need, of, knowing, more, about, its, potential, to, produce, energy, in, late, october, 1973, trudeau, s, government, adopted, a, motion, from, the, new, democratic, party, which, the, trudeau, minority, government, relied, on, for, support, to, establish, a, nationalized, oil, company, the, petro, canada, act, was, passed, in, 1975, under, a, trudeau, majority, government, resulting, in, the, creation, of, a, new, crown, corporation, petro, canada, petro, canada, was, mandated, to, acquire, imported, oil, supplies, take, part, in, energy, research, and, development, and, engage, in, downstream, activities, such, as, refining, and, marketing, the, corporation, started, with, an, initial, 1, 5, billion, in, capital, and, had, preferential, access, to, debt, capital, as, an, agent, of, her, majesty, trudeau, s, government, gave, itself, authority, over, petro, canada, s, capital, budget, and, its, corporate, strategy, making, the, company, its, policy, arm, the, government, also, wanted, the, company, to, be, mainly, active, on, the, frontiers, the, oil, sands, the, arctic, and, the, east, coast, offshore, areas, rather, than, western, canada, where, most, canadian, oil, is, extracted, in, 1976, trudeau, appointed, his, friend, maurice, strong, to, become, the, first, chair, of, the, company, in, foreign, affairs, trudeau, kept, canada, in, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, but, often, pursued, an, independent, path, in, international, relations, trudeau, was, the, first, world, leader, to, meet, john, lennon, and, his, wife, yoko, ono, on, their, 1969, tour, for, world, peace, lennon, said, after, talking, with, trudeau, for, 50, minutes, that, trudeau, was, a, beautiful, person, and, that, if, all, politicians, were, like, pierre, trudeau, there, would, be, world, peace, the, diplomat, john, g, h, halstead, who, worked, as, a, close, adviser, to, trudeau, for, a, time, described, him, as, a, man, who, never, read, any, of, the, policy, papers, submitted, by, the, external, affairs, department, instead, preferring, short, briefings, on, the, issues, before, meeting, other, leaders, and, that, trudeau, usually, tried, to, wing, his, way, through, international, meetings, by, being, witty, halstead, stated, that, trudeau, viewed, foreign, policy, as, only, for, dabbing, saying, he, much, preferred, domestic, affairs, in, august, 1968, the, trudeau, government, expressed, disapproval, of, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, having, the, canadian, delegation, at, the, united, nations, vote, for, a, resolution, condemning, the, invasion, which, failed, to, pass, owing, to, a, soviet, veto, however, trudeau, made, it, clear, that, he, did, not, want, an, intensified, cold, war, as, a, result, of, the, invasion, and, worked, to, avoid, a, rupture, with, moscow, in, a, speech, in, december, 1968, trudeau, asked, can, we, assume, russia, wants, war, because, it, invaded, czechoslovakia, in, 1968, 1969, trudeau, wanted, to, pull, canada, out, of, nato, arguing, that, the, mad, mutually, assured, destruction, caused, by, a, soviet, american, nuclear, exchange, made, it, highly, unlikely, that, the, soviet, union, would, ever, invade, west, germany, thereby, making, nato, into, an, expensive, irrelevance, in, his, view, in, march, 1969, trudeau, visited, washington, to, meet, president, richard, nixon, though, the, meeting, was, very, civil, nixon, came, to, intensely, dislike, trudeau, over, time, referring, to, the, prime, minister, in, 1971, as, that, asshole, trudeau, nixon, made, it, clear, to, trudeau, that, a, canada, that, remained, in, nato, would, be, taken, more, seriously, in, washington, than, a, canada, that, left, nato, trudeau, himself, noted, during, a, speech, given, before, the, national, press, club, during, the, same, visit, that, the, united, states, was, by, far, canada, s, largest, trading, partner, saying, living, next, to, you, is, in, some, way, like, sleeping, with, an, elephant, no, matter, how, friendly, and, even, tempered, the, beast, one, is, affected, by, every, twitch, and, grunt, the, nato, question, badly, divided, the, cabinet, the, diplomat, marcel, cadieux, accused, trudeau, of, being, ne, semble, pas, croire, du, tout, au, danger, sovi, tique, as, a, diplomat, the, devout, catholic, cadieux, had, served, on, the, international, control, commission, in, 1954, 55, where, his, experiences, of, witnessing, the, exodus, of, two, million, vietnamese, catholics, from, north, vietnam, to, south, vietnam, made, him, into, a, very, firm, anti, communist, in, late, march, 1969, trudeau, s, cabinet, was, torn, by, debate, as, ministers, divided, into, pro, nato, and, anti, nato, camps, and, trudeau, s, own, feelings, were, with, the, latter, defence, minister, l, o, cadieux, threatened, to, resign, in, protest, if, canada, left, nato, leading, trudeau, who, wanted, to, keep, a, french, canadian, in, a, high, profile, portfolio, such, as, the, department, of, national, defence, to, meet, cadieux, on, april, 2, to, discuss, a, possible, compromise, trudeau, and, cadieux, agreed, that, canada, would, stay, in, nato, but, drastically, cut, back, its, contributions, despite, warnings, from, ross, campbell, the, canadian, member, of, the, nato, council, that, the, scale, of, the, cuts, envisioned, would, break, canada, s, treaty, commitments, ultimately, the, fact, the, united, states, would, be, more, favourably, disposed, to, a, canada, in, nato, and, the, need, to, maintain, cabinet, unity, led, trudeau, to, decide, despite, his, own, inclinations, to, stay, in, nato, after, much, discussion, within, the, cabinet, trudeau, finally, declared, that, canada, would, stay, within, nato, after, all, on, april, 3, but, he, would, cut, back, canada, s, forces, within, europe, by, 50, the, way, that, canada, cut, its, nato, contributions, by, 50, caused, tensions, with, other, nato, allies, with, the, british, government, of, prime, minister, harold, wilson, publicly, protesting, the, cuts, relations, with, the, united, states, deteriorated, on, many, points, during, the, nixon, presidency, 1969, 74, including, trade, disputes, defence, agreements, energy, fishing, the, environment, cultural, imperialism, and, foreign, policy, on, january, 4, 1973, trudeau, voted, for, a, resolution, in, the, house, of, commons, that, condemned, the, american, christmas, bombings, against, north, vietnam, between, 18, and, 29, december, 1972, as, a, consequence, canadian, american, relations, already, under, stress, because, of, the, mutual, contempt, between, nixon, and, trudeau, reached, a, post, war, nadir, nixon, was, infuriated, by, the, resolution, and, refused, to, see, marcel, cadieux, the, canadian, ambassador, in, washington, in, protest, for, the, rest, of, 1973, nixon, was, only, prevented, from, lashing, out, more, by, his, desire, to, have, canada, continue, as, the, pro, western, member, on, the, international, control, commission, for, vietnam, prompted, by, halstead, who, was, known, as, a, proponent, of, economic, rebalancing, by, seeking, closer, economic, ties, with, the, eec, trudeau, made, a, visit, to, brussels, in, october, 1973, to, see, fran, ois, xavier, ortoli, the, president, of, the, european, commission, to, ask, for, a, canadian, eec, free, trade, agreement, halstead, used, nixon, s, displeasure, with, canada, as, an, argument, that, it, was, finally, time, for, economic, rebalancing, by, seeking, closer, ties, with, the, eec, a, thesis, that, halstead, had, been, advocating, ever, since, the, early, 1960s, ortoli, refused, trudeau, s, request, for, a, free, trade, agreement, with, the, eec, saying, that, was, out, of, the, question, but, did, agree, to, open, talks, on, lowering, tariffs, between, canada, and, the, eec, trudeau, continued, his, attempts, at, increasing, canada, s, international, profile, including, joining, the, g7, group, of, major, economic, powers, in, 1976, at, the, behest, of, u, s, president, gerald, ford, american, canadian, relations, changed, for, the, better, when, trudeau, found, a, better, rapport, with, ford, s, successor, jimmy, carter, the, late, 1970s, saw, a, more, sympathetic, american, attitude, toward, canadian, political, and, economic, needs, the, pardoning, of, draft, evaders, who, had, moved, to, canada, and, the, passing, of, old, sore, points, such, as, watergate, and, the, vietnam, war, canada, more, than, ever, welcomed, american, investments, during, the, stagflation, high, inflation, and, high, unemployment, at, the, same, time, that, hurt, both, nations, in, the, 1970s, trudeau, attached, little, importance, to, relations, with, the, united, kingdom, while, he, shot, down, a, suggestion, by, one, of, his, ministers, to, turn, canada, into, a, republic, in, 1968, he, treated, the, monarchy, with, a, certain, bemused, contempt, britain, s, 1973, decision, to, join, the, european, economic, community, eec, confirmed, trudeau, s, view, that, the, uk, was, a, declining, power, that, had, little, to, offer, canada, while, the, way, that, japan, had, replaced, britain, as, canada, s, second, largest, trading, partner, was, taken, as, further, confirmation, of, these, views, however, trudeau, was, attached, to, the, commonwealth, believing, it, was, an, international, body, that, allowed, canada, to, project, influence, into, the, third, world, he, noted, it, was, one, of, the, few, bodies, that, allowed, leaders, from, the, first, and, third, worlds, to, meet, on, a, regular, basis, although, france, was, no, longer, as, supportive, of, quebec, separatism, as, it, had, been, under, president, charles, de, gaulle, in, the, 1960s, the, way, that, french, politicians, expressed, the, idea, of, a, special, franco, quebecois, bond, as, opposed, to, a, special, franco, canadian, bond, throughout, the, 1970s, led, to, tensions, with, paris, in, 1970, 71, the, commonwealth, was, threatened, with, a, split, as, a, number, of, african, members, supported, by, india, denounced, britain, s, policy, of, selling, arms, to, apartheid, south, africa, which, the, uk, argued, was, necessary, because, south, africa, was, not, only, one, of, the, world, s, largest, gold, producers, but, its, government, was, anti, communist, and, pro, western, the, wilson, government, had, imposed, an, arms, embargo, on, south, africa, in, 1964, which, the, new, conservative, heath, government, ended, in, 1970, a, number, of, african, commonwealth, nations, led, by, kenneth, kaunda, of, zambia, and, julius, nyerere, of, tanzania, threatened, to, leave, the, organization, if, britain, continued, with, arms, sales, to, south, africa, when, british, prime, minister, edward, heath, visited, ottawa, in, december, 1970, his, meetings, with, trudeau, went, badly, in, what, was, described, as, a, no, holds, barred, style, trudeau, told, heath, that, the, british, arms, sales, to, white, supremacist, south, africa, were, threatening, the, unity, of, the, commonwealth, at, a, commonwealth, summit, in, singapore, between, 14, and, 22, january, 1971, trudeau, argued, that, apartheid, was, not, sustainable, in, the, long, run, given, that, the, black, population, of, south, africa, vastly, outnumbered, the, white, population, and, it, was, extremely, myopic, for, britain, to, be, supporting, south, africa, given, that, majority, rule, in, south, africa, was, inevitable, however, trudeau, worked, for, a, compromise, to, avoid, a, split, in, the, commonwealth, arguing, that, it, needed, to, do, more, to, pressure, south, africa, to, end, apartheid, peacefully, and, saying, that, a, race, war, in, south, africa, would, be, the, worse, possible, way, to, end, apartheid, the, conference, ended, with, a, compromise, agreement, in, which, britain, would, fulfill, its, existing, arms, contracts, to, south, africa, but, henceforth, sell, no, more, weapons, to, the, country, ultimately, the, british, only, sold, south, africa, five, attack, helicopters, singaporean, prime, minister, and, conference, host, lee, kuan, yew, later, praised, trudeau, for, his, efforts, at, the, summit, to, hold, the, commonwealth, together, despite, the, passions, aroused, by, the, south, african, issue, trudeau, had, an, especially, close, friendship, with, the, social, democratic, west, german, chancellor, helmut, schmidt, whom, he, greatly, liked, both, for, his, left, wing, politics, and, as, a, practical, politician, who, was, more, concerned, about, getting, things, done, rather, than, with, ideological, questions, schmidt, was, sympathetic, towards, trudeau, s, rebalancing, concept, telling, trudeau, that, he, wanted, west, germany, to, have, two, north, american, partners, instead, of, one, and, promised, at, a, 1975, meeting, to, use, west, german, influence, within, the, eec, to, grant, canada, better, trade, terms, in, exchange, for, canada, spending, more, on, its, nato, commitments, after, meeting, schmidt, trudeau, performed, a, volte, face, on, nato, speaking, at, a, press, conference, of, how, much, he, valued, nato, as, an, alliance, that, was, established, for, collective, security, in, europe, to, show, his, approval, of, schmidt, trudeau, not, only, agreed, to, spend, more, on, nato, but, insisted, that, the, canadian, army, buy, the, german, built, leopard, tanks, which, thereby, boosted, the, west, german, arms, industry, over, the, opposition, of, the, finance, department, which, felt, that, buying, the, leopard, tanks, was, wasteful, schmidt, s, support, was, especially, welcome, as, wilson, once, again, back, as, the, british, prime, minister, proved, unwilling, to, lobby, for, the, eec, lowering, tariffs, on, canadian, goods, merely, saying, that, he, was, willing, to, interpret, canadian, policy, to, the, other, eec, leaders, by, contrast, the, west, german, foreign, minister, hans, dietrich, genscher, gave, trudeau, a, firm, promise, of, west, german, support, for, an, eec, canadian, economic, agreement, the, major, hold, out, was, france, which, was, stoutly, opposed, to, an, eec, canadian, agreement, seeing, giving, eec, market, access, to, canadian, agriculture, as, a, threat, to, french, agriculture, in, july, 1976, a, canadian, eec, framework, economic, agreement, was, signed, which, came, into, effect, on, 1, october, 1976, trudeau, hoped, would, be, the, framework, agreement, would, be, the, first, step, towards, a, canadian, eec, free, trade, agreement, but, the, eec, proved, to, be, uninterested, in, free, trade, with, canada, trudeau, established, canadian, diplomatic, relations, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, before, the, united, states, did, in, 1979, and, went, on, an, official, visit, to, beijing, on, 10, february, 1969, the, government, announced, its, wish, to, establish, diplomatic, relations, with, the, people, s, republic, and, trudeau, was, mortified, when, the, chinese, refused, to, respond, at, first, which, made, him, look, foolish, unknown, to, trudeau, the, chinese, diplomatic, corps, had, been, so, thoroughly, purged, during, the, great, proletarian, cultural, revolution, that, the, chinese, foreign, ministry, barely, functioned, by, early, 1969, on, 19, february, 1969, the, chinese, finally, responded, and, agreed, to, open, talks, in, stockholm, on, establishing, diplomatic, relations, which, began, on, 3, april, 1969, trudeau, expected, the, negotiations, to, be, a, mere, formality, but, relations, were, not, finally, established, until, october, 1970, the, delay, was, largely, because, the, chinese, insisted, that, canada, have, no, relations, whatsoever, with, the, chiang, kai, shek, gang, as, they, called, the, kuomintang, regime, in, taiwan, and, agree, to, support, the, chinese, position, that, taiwan, was, a, part, of, the, people, s, republic, a, position, that, caused, problems, on, the, canadian, side, as, it, implied, canadian, support, for, china, s, viewpoint, that, it, had, the, right, to, take, taiwan, by, force, into, the, people, s, republic, on, 10, october, 1970, a, statement, was, issued, by, the, external, affairs, department, in, ottawa, saying, the, chinese, government, reaffirms, that, taiwan, is, an, inalienable, part, of, the, territory, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, canadian, government, takes, note, of, the, chinese, position, after, the, statement, was, issued, china, and, canada, established, diplomatic, relations, on, the, same, day, the, so, called, canadian, formula, under, which, a, nation, takes, note, of, the, chinese, viewpoint, that, taiwan, is, part, of, the, people, s, republic, has, been, often, copied, by, other, nations, that, have, established, diplomatic, relations, with, beijing, most, notably, the, united, states, in, 1979, in, october, 1973, trudeau, visited, beijing, to, meet, mao, zedong, and, zhou, enlai, where, trudeau, was, hailed, as, old, friend, a, term, of, high, approval, in, china, in, 1976, trudeau, succumbing, to, pressure, from, the, chinese, government, issued, an, order, barring, taiwan, from, participating, as, china, in, the, 1976, montreal, olympics, although, technically, it, was, a, matter, for, the, ioc, his, action, strained, relations, with, the, united, states, from, president, ford, future, president, carter, and, the, press, and, subjected, canada, to, international, condemnation, and, shame, trudeau, was, known, as, a, friend, of, fidel, castro, the, leader, of, cuba, in, january, 1976, trudeau, visited, cuba, to, meet, castro, and, shouted, to, a, crowd, in, havana, viva, cuba, viva, castro, long, live, cuba, long, live, castro, in, november, 1975, cuba, had, intervened, in, the, angolan, civil, war, on, the, side, of, the, marxist, mpla, government, supported, by, the, soviet, union, which, was, fighting, against, the, unita, and, fnla, guerrilla, movements, supported, by, the, united, states, south, africa, and, zaire, the, modern, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, though, both, zaire, and, south, africa, had, also, intervened, in, angola, sending, in, troops, to, support, the, flna, and, unita, respectively, it, was, the, cuban, intervention, in, angola, that, caused, the, controversy, in, the, west, many, people, in, the, west, saw, the, cuban, intervention, as, aggression, and, as, a, power, play, by, the, soviet, union, to, win, a, sphere, of, influence, in, africa, angola, was, amply, endowed, with, oil, and, many, saw, the, victory, of, the, mpla, cuban, forces, in, the, first, round, of, the, angolan, civil, war, in, 1975, 1976, as, a, major, blow, to, western, interests, in, africa, trudeau, s, remarks, in, havana, were, widely, seen, in, the, west, as, not, only, expressing, approval, of, cuba, s, communist, government, but, also, the, cuban, intervention, in, angola, in, fact, trudeau, did, press, castro, in, private, to, pull, his, troops, out, of, angola, only, for, castro, to, insist, that, cuba, would, pull, its, forces, out, of, angola, only, when, south, africa, likewise, pulled, its, forces, out, of, not, only, angola, but, also, southwest, africa, modern, namibia, as, well, trudeau, s, embrace, of, castro, attracted, much, criticism, in, the, united, states, which, allowed, trudeau, to, pose, as, a, leader, who, was, standing, up, to, the, united, states, without, seriously, damaging, american, canadian, relations, on, september, 1, 1972, over, four, years, into, the, liberals, five, year, mandate, trudeau, called, an, election, for, october, 30, at, the, start, of, the, campaign, polls, showed, the, liberals, 10, points, ahead, of, the, progressive, conservatives, led, by, robert, stanfield, who, previously, lost, to, trudeau, in, the, 1968, election, however, the, results, produced, a, liberal, minority, government, with, the, liberals, winning, 109, seats, compared, to, the, pcs, 107, this, was, one, of, the, closest, elections, in, canadian, history, trudeaumania, from, the, 1968, election, had, worn, off, not, least, because, of, a, slumping, economy, and, rising, unemployment, the, new, democratic, party, led, by, david, lewis, held, the, balance, of, power, in, may, 1974, the, house, of, commons, passed, a, motion, of, no, confidence, in, the, trudeau, government, defeating, its, budget, bill, after, trudeau, intentionally, antagonized, stanfield, and, lewis, the, ensuing, election, focused, mainly, on, the, then, ongoing, economic, recession, stanfield, proposed, the, immediate, introduction, of, wage, and, price, controls, to, help, end, the, increasing, inflation, canada, was, facing, trudeau, mocked, the, proposal, telling, a, newspaper, reporter, that, it, was, the, equivalent, of, a, magician, saying, zap, you, re, frozen, and, instead, promoted, a, variety, of, small, tax, cuts, to, curb, inflation, according, to, trudeau, s, biographer, john, english, ndp, supporters, scared, of, wage, controls, moved, toward, the, liberals, during, the, campaign, the, liberals, were, re, elected, with, a, majority, government, winning, 141, out, of, 264, seats, prompting, stanfield, s, retirement, however, the, liberals, did, not, win, any, seats, in, alberta, where, premier, peter, lougheed, was, a, vociferous, opponent, of, trudeau, s, 1974, budget, as, the, 1970s, wore, on, growing, public, exhaustion, towards, trudeau, s, personality, and, the, country, s, constitutional, debates, caused, his, poll, numbers, to, fall, rapidly, in, the, late, 1970s, at, the, 1978, g7, summit, he, discussed, strategies, for, the, upcoming, election, with, west, german, chancellor, helmut, schmidt, who, advised, him, to, announce, several, spending, cuts, to, quell, criticism, of, the, large, deficits, his, government, was, running, after, a, series, of, by, election, defeats, in, 1978, trudeau, waited, as, long, as, he, could, to, call, a, general, election, in, 1979, he, finally, did, so, only, two, months, from, the, five, year, limit, provided, under, the, british, north, america, act, during, the, election, campaign, the, liberals, faced, declining, poll, numbers, while, the, joe, clark, led, progressive, conservatives, focused, on, pocketbook, issues, to, contrast, trudeau, s, image, with, that, of, the, mild, mannered, clark, trudeau, and, his, advisors, based, their, campaign, on, trudeau, s, decisive, personality, and, his, grasp, of, the, constitution, file, despite, the, general, public, s, apparent, wariness, of, both, the, traditional, liberal, rally, at, maple, leaf, gardens, saw, trudeau, stressing, the, importance, of, major, constitutional, reform, to, general, ennui, and, his, campaign, photo, ops, were, typically, surrounded, by, picket, lines, and, protesters, though, polls, portended, disaster, clark, s, struggles, justifying, his, party, s, populist, platform, and, a, strong, trudeau, performance, in, the, election, debate, helped, bring, the, liberals, to, the, point, of, contention, though, the, liberals, won, the, popular, vote, by, four, points, its, vote, was, concentrated, in, quebec, but, faltered, in, industrial, ontario, this, allowed, the, pcs, to, win, a, plurality, of, the, seats, in, the, house, of, commons, and, form, a, minority, government, trudeau, soon, announced, his, intention, to, resign, as, liberal, party, leader, and, favoured, donald, macdonald, to, be, his, successor, however, before, a, leadership, convention, could, be, held, with, trudeau, s, blessing, and, allan, maceachen, s, manoeuvring, in, the, house, the, liberals, supported, an, ndp, subamendment, to, clark, s, budget, stating, that, the, house, had, no, confidence, in, the, budget, in, canada, as, in, most, other, countries, with, a, westminster, system, budget, votes, are, indirectly, considered, to, be, votes, of, confidence, in, the, government, and, their, failure, automatically, brings, down, the, government, liberal, and, ndp, votes, and, social, credit, abstentions, led, to, the, subamendment, passing, 139, 133, thereby, toppling, clark, s, government, and, triggering, a, new, election, for, a, house, less, than, a, year, old, the, liberal, caucus, along, with, friends, and, advisors, persuaded, trudeau, to, stay, on, as, leader, and, fight, the, election, with, trudeau, s, main, impetus, being, the, upcoming, referendum, on, quebec, sovereignty, trudeau, and, the, liberals, engaged, in, a, new, strategy, for, the, february, 1980, election, facetiously, called, the, low, bridge, it, involved, dramatically, underplaying, trudeau, s, role, and, avoiding, media, appearances, to, the, point, of, refusing, a, televised, debate, on, election, day, ontario, returned, to, the, liberal, fold, and, trudeau, and, the, liberals, defeated, clark, and, won, a, majority, government, the, liberal, victory, in, 1980, highlighted, a, sharp, geographical, divide, in, the, country, the, party, had, won, no, seats, west, of, manitoba, trudeau, in, an, attempt, to, represent, western, interests, offered, to, form, a, coalition, government, with, ed, broadbent, s, ndp, which, had, won, 22, seats, in, the, west, but, was, rebuffed, by, broadbent, out, of, fear, the, party, would, have, no, influence, in, a, majority, government, the, first, challenge, trudeau, faced, upon, re, election, was, the, 1980, quebec, sovereignty, referendum, called, by, the, parti, qu, b, cois, government, of, ren, l, vesque, trudeau, immediately, initiated, federal, involvement, in, the, referendum, reversing, the, clark, government, s, policy, of, leaving, the, issue, to, the, quebec, liberals, and, claude, ryan, he, appointed, jean, chr, tien, as, the, nominal, spokesman, for, the, federal, government, helping, to, push, the, non, cause, to, working, class, voters, who, tuned, out, the, intellectual, ryan, and, trudeau, unlike, ryan, and, the, liberals, he, refused, to, acknowledge, the, legitimacy, of, the, referendum, question, and, noted, that, the, association, required, consent, from, the, other, provinces, in, the, debates, in, the, legislature, during, the, campaign, leading, up, to, the, referendum, l, vesque, said, that, trudeau, s, middle, name, was, scottish, and, that, trudeau, s, aristocratic, upbringing, proved, that, he, was, more, scottish, than, french, a, week, prior, to, the, referendum, trudeau, delivered, one, of, his, most, well, known, speeches, in, which, he, extolled, the, virtues, of, federalism, and, questioned, the, ambiguous, language, of, the, referendum, question, he, described, the, origin, of, the, name, as, canadian, trudeau, promised, a, new, constitutional, agreement, should, quebec, decide, to, stay, in, canada, in, which, english, speaking, canadians, would, have, to, listen, to, valid, concerns, made, by, the, qu, b, cois, on, may, 20, sixty, percent, of, quebeckers, voted, to, remain, in, canada, following, the, announcement, of, the, results, trudeau, said, that, he, had, never, been, so, proud, to, be, a, quebecker, and, a, canadian, in, the, government, s, first, budget, delivered, in, october, 1980, by, finance, minister, allan, maceachen, a, long, time, trudeau, loyalist, the, national, energy, program, nep, was, introduced, one, of, the, liberals, most, contentious, policies, the, nep, was, fiercely, protested, by, the, western, provinces, and, was, seen, as, unfairly, depriving, them, of, the, full, economic, benefit, of, their, oil, and, gas, resources, in, order, to, pay, for, nationwide, social, programs, and, make, regional, transfer, payments, to, poorer, parts, of, the, country, sentiments, of, this, kind, were, especially, strong, in, oil, rich, alberta, where, unemployment, rose, from, 4, to, 10, following, passage, of, the, nep, the, western, provinces, blamed, the, devastating, oil, bust, of, the, 1980s, on, the, nep, which, led, to, what, many, termed, western, alienation, alberta, premier, peter, lougheed, entered, into, tough, negotiations, with, trudeau, reaching, a, revenue, sharing, agreement, on, energy, in, 1982, estimates, have, placed, alberta, s, losses, between, 50, billion, and, 100, billion, because, of, the, nep, this, first, budget, was, one, of, a, series, of, unpopular, budgets, delivered, in, response, to, the, oil, shock, of, 1979, and, the, ensuing, severe, global, economic, recession, which, began, at, the, start, of, 1980, in, his, budget, speech, maceachen, said, that, the, global, oil, price, shocks, in, 1973, and, again, in, 1979, had, caused, a, sharp, renewal, of, inflationary, forces, and, real, income, losses, in, canada, and, in, the, industrial, world, they, are, not, just, canadian, problems, they, are, world, wide, problems, leaders, of, developed, countries, raised, their, concerns, at, the, venice, summit, at, meetings, of, finance, ministers, of, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, the, bank, of, canada, wrote, that, there, was, a, deeply, troubling, air, of, uncertainty, and, anxiety, about, the, economy, amongst, the, policies, introduced, by, trudeau, s, last, term, in, office, were, an, expansion, in, government, support, for, canada, s, poorest, citizens, by, the, time, trudeau, left, office, in, 1984, the, budget, deficit, was, at, a, whopping, 37, billion, fiscal, year, 1984, 1985, trudeau, s, first, budget, fiscal, year, 1968, 1969, only, had, a, deficit, of, 667, million, inflation, and, unemployment, marred, much, of, trudeau, s, tenure, as, prime, minister, when, trudeau, took, office, in, 1968, canada, had, a, debt, of, 18, billion, 24, of, gdp, which, was, largely, left, over, from, world, war, ii, when, he, left, office, in, 1984, that, debt, stood, at, 200, billion, 46, of, gdp, an, increase, of, 83, in, real, terms, in, 1982, trudeau, succeeded, in, patriating, the, constitution, in, response, to, a, formal, request, from, the, canadian, houses, of, parliament, with, the, consent, of, all, provinces, except, quebec, the, british, parliament, passed, an, act, ceding, to, the, governments, of, canada, the, full, responsibility, for, amending, canada, s, constitution, earlier, in, his, tenure, he, had, met, with, opposition, from, the, provincial, governments, most, notably, with, the, victoria, charter, provincial, premiers, were, united, in, their, concerns, regarding, an, amending, formula, a, court, enforced, charter, of, rights, and, a, further, devolution, of, powers, to, the, provinces, in, 1980, chr, tien, was, tasked, with, creating, a, constitutional, settlement, following, the, quebec, referendum, in, which, quebeckers, voted, to, remain, in, canada, after, chairing, a, series, of, increasingly, acrimonious, conferences, with, first, ministers, on, the, issue, trudeau, announced, the, federal, government, s, intention, to, proceed, with, a, request, to, the, british, parliament, to, patriate, the, constitution, unilaterally, with, additions, to, be, approved, by, a, referendum, without, input, from, provincial, governments, trudeau, was, backed, by, the, ndp, ontario, premier, bill, davis, and, new, brunswick, premier, richard, hatfield, and, was, opposed, by, the, remaining, premiers, and, pc, leader, joe, clark, after, numerous, provincial, governments, challenged, the, legality, of, the, decision, using, their, reference, power, conflicting, decisions, prompted, a, supreme, court, decision, that, stated, unilateral, patriation, was, legal, but, was, in, contravention, of, a, constitutional, convention, that, the, provinces, be, consulted, and, have, general, agreement, to, the, changes, after, the, court, decision, which, prompted, some, reservations, in, the, british, parliament, of, accepting, a, unilateral, request, trudeau, agreed, to, meet, with, the, premiers, one, more, time, before, proceeding, at, this, meeting, trudeau, reached, an, agreement, with, nine, of, the, premiers, on, patriating, the, constitution, and, implementing, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, with, the, caveat, that, parliament, and, the, provincial, legislatures, would, have, the, ability, to, use, a, notwithstanding, clause, to, protect, some, laws, from, judicial, oversight, the, notable, exception, was, l, vesque, who, trudeau, believed, would, never, have, signed, an, agreement, the, objection, of, the, quebec, government, to, the, new, constitutional, provisions, became, a, source, of, continued, acrimony, between, the, federal, and, quebec, governments, and, would, forever, stain, trudeau, s, reputation, amongst, nationalists, in, the, province, the, constitution, act, 1982, including, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, was, proclaimed, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, as, queen, of, canada, on, april, 17, 1982, with, the, enactment, of, the, canada, act, 1982, the, british, parliament, ceded, all, authority, over, canada, to, the, governments, of, canada, the, constitution, act, 1982, part, of, the, canada, act, 1982, established, the, supremacy, of, the, constitution, of, canada, which, now, could, only, be, amended, by, the, federal, and, provincial, governments, under, the, amending, formula, established, by, the, constitution, act, 1982, the, charter, represented, the, final, step, in, trudeau, s, liberal, vision, of, a, fully, independent, canada, based, on, fundamental, human, rights, and, the, protection, of, individual, freedoms, as, well, as, those, of, linguistic, and, cultural, minorities, section, 35, of, the, constitution, act, 1982, clarified, issues, of, aboriginal, and, equality, rights, including, establishing, the, previously, denied, aboriginal, rights, of, m, tis, section, 15, dealing, with, equality, rights, has, been, used, to, remedy, societal, discrimination, against, minority, groups, the, coupling, of, the, direct, and, indirect, influences, of, the, charter, has, meant, that, it, has, grown, to, influence, every, aspect, of, canadian, life, and, the, charter, s, notwithstanding, clause, has, been, infrequently, used, by, 1984, the, progressive, conservatives, held, a, substantial, lead, in, opinion, polls, under, their, new, leader, brian, mulroney, and, polls, indicated, that, the, liberals, faced, all, but, certain, defeat, if, trudeau, led, them, into, the, next, election, on, february, 29, 1984, a, day, after, what, he, described, as, a, walk, through, the, snowy, streets, of, ottawa, trudeau, announced, he, would, not, lead, the, liberals, into, the, next, election, he, was, frequently, known, to, use, the, term, walk, in, the, snow, as, a, trope, he, claimed, to, have, taken, a, similar, walk, in, december, 1979, before, deciding, to, take, the, liberals, into, the, 1980, election, trudeau, formally, retired, on, june, 30, ending, his, 15, year, tenure, as, prime, minister, he, was, succeeded, by, john, turner, a, former, cabinet, minister, under, both, trudeau, and, lester, pearson, before, handing, power, to, turner, trudeau, took, the, unusual, step, of, appointing, liberal, senators, from, western, provinces, to, his, cabinet, he, advised, governor, general, jeanne, sauv, to, appoint, over, 200, liberals, to, patronage, positions, he, and, turner, then, crafted, a, legal, agreement, calling, for, turner, to, advise, an, additional, 70, patronage, appointments, the, sheer, volume, of, appointments, combined, with, questions, about, the, appointees, qualifications, led, to, condemnation, from, across, the, political, spectrum, however, an, apparent, rebound, in, the, polls, prompted, turner, to, call, an, election, for, september, 1984, almost, a, year, before, it, was, due, turner, s, appointment, deal, with, trudeau, came, back, to, haunt, the, liberals, at, the, english, language, debate, when, mulroney, demanded, that, turner, apologize, for, not, advising, that, the, appointments, be, cancelled, advice, that, sauv, would, have, been, required, to, follow, by, convention, turner, claimed, that, i, had, no, option, but, to, let, the, appointments, stand, prompting, mulroney, to, tell, him, you, had, an, option, sir, to, say, no, and, you, chose, to, say, yes, to, the, old, attitudes, and, the, old, stories, of, the, liberal, party, in, the, election, mulroney, won, the, largest, majority, government, by, total, number, of, seats, and, second, largest, majority, by, proportion, of, seats, in, canadian, history, the, liberals, with, turner, as, leader, lost, 95, seats, at, the, time, the, worst, defeat, of, a, sitting, government, at, the, federal, level, by, proportion, of, seats, at, the, time, trudeau, joined, the, montreal, law, firm, heenan, blaikie, as, counsel, and, settled, in, the, historic, maison, cormier, in, montreal, following, his, retirement, from, politics, though, he, rarely, gave, speeches, or, spoke, to, the, press, his, interventions, into, public, debate, had, a, significant, impact, when, they, occurred, trudeau, wrote, and, spoke, out, against, both, the, meech, lake, accord, and, charlottetown, accord, proposals, to, amend, the, canadian, constitution, arguing, that, they, would, weaken, federalism, and, the, charter, of, rights, if, implemented, the, meech, lake, accord, granted, quebec, the, constitutional, right, to, be, a, distinct, society, within, canada, which, theoretically, could, have, been, the, basis, of, a, wide, ranging, devolution, of, power, to, quebec, the, quebec, government, potentially, could, have, been, allowed, to, pass, any, law, short, of, secession, to, protect, quebec, s, constitutional, right, to, be, a, distinct, society, trudeau, claimed, in, his, speeches, that, giving, quebec, the, constitutional, status, of, a, distinct, society, would, lead, to, the, quebec, government, deporting, members, of, quebec, s, english, speaking, minority, his, opposition, to, both, accords, was, considered, one, of, the, major, factors, leading, to, the, defeat, of, the, two, proposals, he, also, continued, to, speak, against, the, parti, qu, b, cois, and, the, sovereignty, movement, with, less, effect, trudeau, also, remained, active, in, international, affairs, visiting, foreign, leaders, and, participating, in, international, associations, such, as, the, club, of, rome, he, met, with, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, and, other, leaders, in, 1985, shortly, afterwards, gorbachev, met, president, ronald, reagan, to, discuss, easing, world, tensions, he, published, his, memoirs, in, 1993, the, book, sold, hundreds, of, thousands, of, copies, in, several, editions, and, became, one, of, the, most, successful, canadian, books, ever, published, in, his, old, age, he, was, afflicted, with, parkinson, s, disease, and, prostate, cancer, and, became, less, active, although, he, continued, to, work, at, his, law, practice, until, a, few, months, before, his, death, at, the, age, of, 80, he, was, devastated, by, the, death, of, his, youngest, son, michel, trudeau, who, was, killed, in, an, avalanche, on, november, 13, 1998, pierre, elliott, trudeau, died, on, september, 28, 2000, aged, 80, and, was, buried, in, the, trudeau, family, crypt, st, r, mi, de, napierville, cemetery, saint, r, mi, quebec, his, body, lay, in, state, in, the, hall, of, honour, in, parliament, hill, s, centre, block, to, allow, canadians, to, pay, their, last, respects, several, world, politicians, including, former, us, president, jimmy, carter, and, fidel, castro, attended, the, funeral, his, son, justin, delivered, the, eulogy, during, the, state, funeral, which, led, to, widespread, speculation, in, the, media, that, a, career, in, politics, was, in, his, future, trudeau, was, a, roman, catholic, and, attended, mass, throughout, his, life, while, mostly, private, about, his, beliefs, he, made, it, clear, that, he, was, a, believer, stating, in, an, interview, with, the, united, church, observer, in, 1971, i, believe, in, life, after, death, i, believe, in, god, and, i, m, a, christian, trudeau, maintained, however, that, he, preferred, to, impose, constraints, on, himself, rather, than, have, them, imposed, from, the, outside, in, this, sense, he, believed, he, was, more, like, a, protestant, than, a, catholic, of, the, era, in, which, he, was, schooled, michael, w, higgins, a, former, president, of, catholic, st, thomas, university, researched, trudeau, s, spirituality, and, finds, that, it, incorporated, elements, of, three, catholic, traditions, the, first, of, these, was, the, jesuits, who, provided, his, education, up, to, the, college, level, trudeau, frequently, displayed, the, logic, and, love, of, argument, consistent, with, that, tradition, a, second, great, spiritual, influence, in, trudeau, s, life, was, dominican, according, to, michel, gourgues, professor, at, dominican, university, college, trudeau, considered, himself, a, lay, dominican, he, studied, philosophy, under, dominican, father, louis, marie, r, gis, and, remained, close, to, him, throughout, his, life, regarding, r, gis, as, spiritual, director, and, friend, another, skein, in, trudeau, s, spirituality, was, a, contemplative, aspect, acquired, from, his, association, with, the, benedictine, tradition, according, to, higgins, trudeau, was, convinced, of, the, centrality, of, meditation, in, a, life, fully, lived, trudeau, meditated, regularly, after, being, initiated, into, transcendental, meditation, by, the, maharishi, mahesh, yogi, he, took, retreats, at, saint, beno, t, du, lac, quebec, and, regularly, attended, hours, and, the, eucharist, at, montreal, s, benedictine, community, although, never, publicly, theological, in, the, way, of, margaret, thatcher, or, tony, blair, nor, evangelical, in, the, way, of, jimmy, carter, or, george, w, bush, trudeau, s, spirituality, according, to, michael, w, higgins, suffused, anchored, and, directed, his, inner, life, in, no, small, part, it, defined, him, described, as, a, swinging, young, bachelor, when, he, became, prime, minister, in, 1968, trudeau, was, reportedly, dating, hollywood, star, barbra, streisand, in, 1969, and, 1970, while, a, serious, romantic, relationship, there, was, no, express, marriage, proposal, contrary, to, one, contemporary, published, report, on, march, 4, 1971, while, prime, minister, trudeau, quietly, married, 22, year, old, margaret, sinclair, who, was, 29, years, younger, at, st, stephen, s, roman, catholic, parish, church, in, north, vancouver, belying, his, publicized, social, exploits, and, nicknames, like, swinging, pierre, and, trendy, trudeau, he, was, an, intense, intellectual, with, robust, work, habits, and, little, time, for, family, or, fun, as, a, result, margaret, felt, trapped, and, bored, in, the, marriage, feelings, that, were, exacerbated, by, her, bipolar, depression, with, which, she, was, later, diagnosed, the, couple, had, three, sons, the, first, two, 23rd, and, current, prime, minister, justin, born, 1971, and, alexandre, born, 1973, were, both, born, on, christmas, day, two, years, apart, their, third, son, michel, 1975, 1998, died, in, an, avalanche, while, skiing, in, kokanee, glacier, provincial, park, trudeau, and, margaret, separated, in, 1977, and, were, divorced, in, 1984, he, was, involved, with, guitarist, liona, boyd, for, eight, years, during, this, time, when, his, divorce, was, finalized, in, 1984, trudeau, became, the, first, canadian, prime, minister, to, become, a, single, parent, as, the, result, of, divorce, in, 1984, trudeau, was, romantically, involved, with, margot, kidder, a, canadian, actress, famous, for, her, role, as, lois, lane, in, superman, the, movie, and, its, sequels, in, the, last, months, of, his, prime, ministership, and, after, leaving, office, in, 1991, trudeau, became, a, father, again, with, deborah, margaret, ryland, coyne, to, his, only, daughter, sarah, coyne, later, stood, for, the, 2013, liberal, party, of, canada, leadership, election, and, came, fifth, in, a, poll, won, by, justin, trudeau, began, practising, judo, sometime, in, the, mid, 1950s, when, he, was, in, his, mid, thirties, and, by, the, end, of, the, decade, he, was, ranked, ikky, brown, belt, later, when, he, travelled, to, japan, as, prime, minister, he, was, promoted, to, shodan, first, degree, black, belt, by, the, kodokan, and, then, promoted, to, nidan, second, degree, black, belt, by, masao, takahashi, in, ottawa, before, leaving, office, trudeau, began, the, night, of, his, famous, walk, in, the, snow, before, announcing, his, retirement, in, 1984, by, going, to, judo, with, his, sons, trudeau, was, a, strong, advocate, for, a, federalist, model, of, government, in, canada, developing, and, promoting, his, ideas, in, response, and, contrast, to, strengthening, quebec, nationalist, movements, for, instance, the, social, and, political, atmosphere, created, during, maurice, duplessis, time, in, power, federalism, in, this, context, can, be, defined, as, a, particular, way, of, sharing, political, power, among, different, peoples, within, a, state, those, who, believe, in, federalism, hold, that, different, peoples, do, not, need, states, of, their, own, in, order, to, enjoy, self, determination, peoples, may, agree, to, share, a, single, state, while, retaining, substantial, degrees, of, self, government, over, matters, essential, to, their, identity, as, peoples, as, a, social, democrat, trudeau, sought, to, combine, and, harmonize, his, theories, on, social, democracy, with, those, of, federalism, so, that, both, could, find, effective, expression, in, canada, he, noted, the, ostensible, conflict, between, socialism, with, its, usually, strong, centralist, government, model, and, federalism, which, expounded, a, division, and, cooperation, of, power, by, both, federal, and, provincial, levels, of, government, in, particular, trudeau, stated, the, following, about, socialists, ather, than, water, down, their, socialism, must, constantly, seek, ways, of, adapting, it, to, a, bicultural, society, governed, under, a, federal, constitution, and, since, the, future, of, canadian, federalism, lies, clearly, in, the, direction, of, co, operation, the, wise, socialist, will, turn, his, thoughts, in, that, direction, keeping, in, mind, the, importance, of, establishing, buffer, zones, of, joint, sovereignty, and, co, operative, zones, of, joint, administration, between, the, two, levels, of, government, trudeau, pointed, out, that, in, sociological, terms, canada, is, inherently, a, federalist, society, forming, unique, regional, identities, and, priorities, and, therefore, a, federalist, model, of, spending, and, jurisdictional, powers, is, most, appropriate, he, argues, in, the, age, of, the, mass, society, it, is, no, small, advantage, to, foster, the, creation, of, quasi, sovereign, communities, at, the, provincial, level, where, power, is, that, much, less, remote, from, the, people, trudeau, s, idealistic, plans, for, a, cooperative, canadian, federalist, state, were, resisted, and, hindered, as, a, result, of, his, narrowness, on, ideas, of, identity, and, socio, cultural, pluralism, while, the, idea, of, a, nation, in, the, sociological, sense, is, acknowledged, by, trudeau, he, considers, the, allegiance, which, it, generates, emotive, and, particularistic, to, be, contrary, to, the, idea, of, cohesion, between, humans, and, as, such, creating, fertile, ground, for, the, internal, fragmentation, of, states, and, a, permanent, state, of, conflict, this, position, garnered, significant, criticism, for, trudeau, in, particular, from, quebec, and, first, nations, peoples, on, the, basis, that, his, theories, denied, their, rights, to, nationhood, first, nations, communities, raised, particular, concerns, with, the, proposed, 1969, white, paper, developed, under, trudeau, by, jean, chr, tien, trudeau, and, the, quebec, federalist, historian, fernand, ouellet, who, was, a, devout, follower, and, admirer, of, trudeau, and, trudeauism, frequently, influenced, each, other, intellectually, in, their, ideas, and, texts, on, their, anti, nationalist, conception, of, the, history, of, quebec, though, they, never, formed, a, personal, friendship, trudeau, remains, well, regarded, by, many, canadians, however, the, passage, of, time, has, only, slightly, softened, the, strong, antipathy, he, inspired, among, his, opponents, trudeau, s, strong, personality, contempt, for, his, opponents, and, distaste, for, compromise, on, many, issues, have, made, him, as, historian, michael, bliss, puts, it, one, of, the, most, admired, and, most, disliked, of, all, canadian, prime, ministers, he, haunts, us, still, biographers, christina, mccall, and, stephen, clarkson, wrote, in, 1990, trudeau, s, electoral, successes, were, matched, in, the, 20th, century, only, by, those, of, william, lyon, mackenzie, king, trudeau, s, most, enduring, legacy, may, lie, in, his, contribution, to, canadian, nationalism, and, of, pride, in, canada, in, and, for, itself, rather, than, as, a, derivative, of, the, british, commonwealth, his, role, in, this, effort, and, his, related, battles, with, quebec, on, behalf, of, canadian, unity, cemented, his, political, position, when, in, office, despite, the, controversies, he, faced, and, remain, the, most, remembered, aspect, of, his, tenure, afterwards, many, politicians, still, use, the, term, taking, a, walk, in, the, snow, the, line, trudeau, used, to, describe, how, he, arrived, at, the, decision, to, leave, office, in, 1984, other, popular, trudeauisms, frequently, used, are, just, watch, me, the, trudeau, salute, and, fuddle, duddle, maclean, s, 1997, and, 2011, scholarly, surveys, ranked, him, twice, as, the, fifth, best, canadian, prime, minister, and, in, 2016, the, fourth, best, the, cbc, s,

watchers, of, the, program, bilingualism, is, one, of, trudeau, s, most, lasting, accomplishments, having, been, fully, integrated, into, the, federal, government, s, services, documents, and, broadcasting, though, not, however, in, provincial, governments, except, for, full, bilingualism, in, new, brunswick, and, some, french, language, service, rights, in, ontario, and, manitoba, while, official, bilingualism, has, settled, some, of, the, grievances, francophones, had, towards, the, federal, government, many, francophones, had, hoped, that, canadians, would, be, able, to, function, in, the, official, language, of, their, choice, no, matter, where, in, the, country, they, were, however, trudeau, s, ambitions, in, this, arena, have, been, overstated, trudeau, once, said, that, he, regretted, the, use, of, the, term, bilingualism, because, it, appeared, to, demand, that, all, canadians, speak, two, languages, in, fact, trudeau, s, vision, was, to, see, canada, as, a, bilingual, confederation, in, which, all, cultures, would, have, a, place, in, this, way, his, conception, broadened, beyond, simply, the, relationship, of, quebec, to, canada, the, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, was, one, of, trudeau, s, most, enduring, legacies, it, is, seen, as, advancing, civil, rights, and, liberties, and, has, become, a, cornerstone, of, canadian, values, for, most, canadians, court, challenges, based, on, the, charter, have, been, used, to, advance, the, cause, of, women, s, equality, establish, french, school, boards, in, provinces, with, majority, anglophone,

canada, by, the, federal, parliament, trudeau, s, posthumous, reputation, in, the, western, provinces, is, notably, less, favourable, than, in, the, rest, of, english, speaking, canada, and, he, is, sometimes, regarded, as, the, father, of, western, alienation, to, many, westerners, trudeau, s, policies, seemed, to, favour, other, parts, of, the, country, especially, ontario, and, qu, bec, at, their, expense, outstanding, among, such, policies, was, the, national, energy, program, which, was, seen, as, unfairly, depriving, western, provinces, of, the, full, economic, benefit, from, their, oil, and, gas, resources, in, order, to, pay, for, nationwide, social, programs, and, make, regional, transfer, payments, to, poorer, parts, of, the, country, sentiments, of, this, kind, were, especially, strong, in, oil, rich, alberta, in, british, columbia, premier, w, a, c, bennett, in, 1970, argued, that, trudeau, s, government, is, quebec, nationalist, oriented, he, also, implied, that, quebec, received, special, treatment, from, ottawa, as, a, result, more, particularly, two, incidents, involving, trudeau, are, remembered, as, having, fostered, western, alienation, and, as, emblematic, of, it, during, a, visit, to, saskatoon, saskatchewan, on, july, 17, 1969, trudeau, met, with, a, group, of, farmers, who, were, protesting, the, canadian, wheat, board, the, widely, remembered, perception, is, that, trudeau, dismissed, the, protesters, concerns, with, why, should, i, sell, your, wheat, however, he, had, asked, the, question, rhetorically, and, then, proceeded, to, answer, it, himself, years, later, on, a, train, trip, through, salmon, arm, british, columbia, he, gave, the, finger, to, a, group, of, protesters, through, the, carriage, window, less, widely, remembered, is, that, the, protesters, were, shouting, anti, french, slogans, at, the, train, trudeau, s, legacy, in, quebec, is, mixed, many, credit, his, actions, during, the, october, crisis, as, crucial, in, terminating, the, front, de, lib, ration, du, qu, bec, flq, as, a, force, in, quebec, and, ensuring, that, the, campaign, for, quebec, separatism, took, a, democratic, and, peaceful, route, however, his, imposition, of, the, war, measures, act, which, received, majority, support, at, the, time, is, remembered, by, some, in, quebec, and, elsewhere, as, an, attack, on, democracy, trudeau, is, also, credited, by, many, for, the, defeat, of, the, 1980, quebec, referendum, at, the, federal, level, trudeau, faced, almost, no, strong, political, opposition, in, quebec, during, his, time, as, prime, minister, for, instance, his, liberal, party, captured, 74, out, of, 75, qu, bec, seats, in, the, 1980, federal, election, provincially, though, qu, b, cois, twice, elected, the, pro, sovereignty, parti, qu, b, cois, moreover, there, were, not, at, that, time, any, pro, sovereignty, federal, parties, such, as, the, bloc, qu, b, cois, since, the, signing, of, the, constitution, act, 1982, in, 1982, and, until, 2015, the, liberal, party, of, canada, had, not, succeeded, in, winning, a, majority, of, seats, in, quebec, he, was, disliked, by, the, qu, b, cois, nationalists, trudeau,
