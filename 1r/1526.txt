of, the, nineteenth, century, his, book, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, 1660, 1783, 1890, won, immediate, recognition, especially, in, europe, and, with, its, successor, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, the, french, revolution, and, empire, 1793, 1812, 1892, made, him, world, famous, mahan, was, born, on, september, 27, 1840, at, west, point, new, york, to, dennis,

and, mary, jay, daughter, of, sir, james, jay, mahan, s, middle, name, honors, the, father, of, west, point, sylvanus, thayer, mahan, attended, saint, james, school, an, episcopal, college, preparatory, academy, in, western, maryland, he, then, studied, at, columbia, for, two, years, where, he, was, a, member, of, the, philolexian, society, debating, club, against, the, better, judgment, of, his, father, mahan, then, entered, the, u, s, naval, academy, where, he, graduated, second, in, his, class, in, 1859, after, graduation, he, was, assigned, to, the, frigate, congress, from, 9, june, 1859, until, 1861, he, then, joined, the, steam, corvette, pocahontas, of, the, south, atlantic, blockading, squadron, and, participated, in, the, battle, of, port, royal, in, south, carolina, early, in, the, american, civil, war, commissioned, as, a, lieutenant, in, 1861, mahan, served, as, an, officer, on, uss, worcester, and, james, adger, and, as, an, instructor, at, the, naval, academy, in, 1865, he, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, commander, and, then, to, commander, 1872, and, captain, 1885, as, commander, of, the, uss, wachusett, he, was, stationed, at, callao, peru, protecting, u, s, interests, during, the, final, stages, of, the, war, of, the, pacific, while, in, actual, command, of, a, ship, his, skills, were, not, exemplary, and, a, number, of, vessels, under, his, command, were, involved, in, collisions, with, both, moving, and, stationary, objects, he, preferred, old, square, rigged, vessels, rather, than, smoky, noisy, steamships, of, his, own, day, and, he, tried, to, avoid, active, sea, duty, in, 1885, he, was, appointed, as, a, lecturer, in, naval, history, and, tactics, at, the, naval, war, college, before, entering, on, his, duties, college, president, rear, admiral, stephen, b, luce, pointed, mahan, in, the, direction, of, writing, his, future, studies, on, the, influence, of, sea, power, during, his, first, year, on, the, faculty, he, remained, at, his, home, in, new, york, city, researching, and, writing, his, lectures, though, he, was, prepared, to, become, a, professor, in, 1886, luce, was, given, command, of, the, north, atlantic, squadron, and, mahan, became, president, of, the, naval, war, college, by, default, june, 22, 1886, january, 12, 1889, july, 22, 1892, may, 10, 1893, there, in, 1888, he, met, and, befriended, future, president, theodore, roosevelt, then, a, visiting, lecturer, mahan, s, lectures, based, on, secondary, sources, and, the, military, theories, of, antoine, henri, jomini, became, his, sea, power, studies, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, 1660, 1783, 1890, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, the, french, revolution, and, empire, 1793, 1812, 2, vols, 1892, sea, power, in, relation, to, the, war, of, 1812, 2, vols, 1905, and, the, life, of, nelson, the, embodiment, of, the, sea, power, of, great, britain, 2, vols, 1897, mahan, stressed, the, importance, of, the, individual, in, shaping, history, and, extolled, the, traditional, values, of, loyalty, courage, and, service, to, the, state, mahan, sought, to, resurrect, horatio, nelson, as, a, national, hero, in, britain, and, used, his, biography, as, a, platform, for, expressing, his, views, on, naval, strategy, and, tactics, mahan, was, criticized, for, so, strongly, condemning, nelson, s, love, affair, with, lady, emma, hamilton, but, it, remained, the, standard, biography, until, the, appearance, of, carola, oman, s, nelson, 50, years, later, mahan, struck, up, a, friendship, with, pioneering, british, naval, historian, sir, john, knox, laughton, the, pair, maintaining, the, relationship, through, correspondence, and, visits, when, mahan, was, in, london, mahan, was, later, described, as, a, disciple, of, laughton, but, the, two, were, at, pains, to, distinguish, between, each, other, s, line, of, work, laughton, saw, mahan, as, a, theorist, while, mahan, called, laughton, the, historian, mahan, worked, closely, with, william, mccarty, little, another, critical, figure, in, the, early, history, of, the, naval, war, college, a, principal, developer, of, wargaming, in, the, united, states, navy, mahan, credited, little, for, assisting, him, with, preparing, maps, and, charts, for, his, lectures, and, first, book, mahan, s, views, were, shaped, by, 17th, century, conflicts, between, the, dutch, republic, the, kingdom, of, england, the, kingdom, of, france, and, habsburg, spain, and, by, the, naval, conflicts, between, france, and, spain, during, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, british, naval, superiority, eventually, defeated, france, consistently, preventing, invasion, and, an, effective, blockade, mahan, emphasized, that, naval, operations, were, chiefly, to, be, won, by, decisive, battles, and, blockades, in, the, 19th, century, the, united, states, sought, greater, control, over, its, seaborne, commerce, in, order, to, protect, its, economic, interests, which, relied, heavily, on, exports, bound, mainly, for, europe, according, to, peter, paret, s, makers, of, modern, strategy, from, machiavelli, to, the, nuclear, age, mahan, s, emphasis, on, sea, power, as, the, most, important, cause, of, britain, s, rise, to, world, power, neglected, diplomacy, and, land, arms, furthermore, theories, of, sea, power, do, not, explain, the, rise, of, land, empires, such, as, otto, von, bismarck, s, german, empire, or, the, russian, empire, mahan, believed, that, national, greatness, was, inextricably, associated, with, the, sea, with, its, commercial, use, in, peace, and, its, control, in, war, and, he, used, history, as, a, stock, of, examples, to, exemplify, his, theories, arguing, that, the, education, of, naval, officers, should, be, based, on, a, rigorous, study, of, history, mahan, s, framework, derived, from, jomini, and, emphasized, strategic, locations, such, as, choke, points, canals, and, coaling, stations, as, well, as, quantifiable, levels, of, fighting, power, in, a, fleet, mahan, also, believed, that, in, peacetime, states, should, increase, production, and, shipping, capacities, and, acquire, overseas, possessions, though, he, stressed, that, the, number, of, coal, fueling, stations, and, strategic, bases, should, be, limited, to, avoid, draining, too, many, resources, from, the, mother, country, the, primary, mission, of, a, navy, was, to, secure, the, command, of, the, sea, which, would, permit, the, maintenance, of, sea, communications, for, one, s, own, ships, while, denying, their, use, to, the, enemy, and, if, necessary, closely, supervise, neutral, trade, control, of, the, sea, could, be, achieved, not, by, destruction, of, commerce, but, only, by, destroying, or, neutralizing, the, enemy, fleet, such, a, strategy, called, for, the, concentration, of, naval, forces, composed, of, capital, ships, not, too, large, but, numerous, well, manned, with, crews, thoroughly, trained, and, operating, under, the, principle, that, the, best, defense, is, an, aggressive, offense, mahan, contended, that, with, a, command, of, the, sea, even, if, local, and, temporary, naval, operations, in, support, of, land, forces, could, be, of, decisive, importance, he, also, believed, that, naval, supremacy, could, be, exercised, by, a, transnational, consortium, acting, in, defense, of, a, multinational, system, of, free, trade, his, theories, expounded, before, the, submarine, became, a, serious, factor, in, warfare, delayed, the, introduction, of, convoys, as, a, defense, against, the, imperial, german, navy, s, u, boat, campaign, during, world, war, i, by, the, 1930s, the, u, s, navy, had, built, long, range, submarines, to, raid, japanese, shipping, but, in, world, war, ii, the, imperial, japanese, armed, forces, still, tied, to, mahan, designed, its, submarines, as, ancillaries, to, the, fleet, and, failed, to, attack, american, supply, lines, in, the, pacific, mahan, s, analysis, of, the, spanish, american, war, suggested, to, him, that, the, great, distances, in, the, pacific, required, the, american, battle, fleet, to, be, designed, with, long, range, striking, power, mahan, believed, first, that, good, political, and, naval, leadership, was, no, less, important, than, geography, when, it, came, to, the, development, of, sea, power, second, mahan, s, unit, of, political, analysis, insofar, as, sea, power, was, concerned, was, a, transnational, consortium, rather, than, a, single, nation, state, third, his, economic, ideal, was, free, trade, rather, than, autarky, fourth, his, recognition, of, the, influence, of, geography, on, strategy, was, tempered, by, a, strong, appreciation, of, the, power, of, contingency, to, affect, outcomes, in, 1890, mahan, prepared, a, secret, contingency, plan, for, war, between, the, british, empire, and, the, united, states, mahan, believed, that, if, the, royal, navy, blockaded, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, the, us, navy, should, be, concentrated, in, one, of, its, ports, preferably, new, york, harbor, with, its, two, widely, separated, exits, and, employ, torpedo, boats, to, defend, the, other, harbors, this, concentration, of, the, u, s, fleet, would, force, the, british, to, tie, down, such, a, large, proportion, of, their, navy, to, watch, the, new, york, exits, that, other, american, ports, would, be, relatively, safe, detached, american, cruisers, should, wage, constant, offensive, action, against, the, enemy, s, exposed, positions, and, if, the, british, were, to, weaken, their, blockade, force, off, new, york, to, attack, another, american, port, the, concentrated, u, s, fleet, could, capture, british, coaling, ports, in, nova, scotia, thereby, seriously, weakening, british, ability, to, engage, in, naval, operations, off, the, american, coast, this, contingency, plan, was, a, clear, example, of, mahan, s, application, of, his, principles, of, naval, war, with, a, clear, reliance, on, jomini, s, principle, of, controlling, strategic, points, timeliness, contributed, no, small, part, to, the, widespread, acceptance, of, mahan, s, theories, although, his, history, was, relatively, thin, based, as, it, was, on, secondary, sources, his, vigorous, style, and, clear, theory, won, widespread, acceptance, of, navalists, and, supporters, of, the, new, imperialism, in, africa, and, asia, given, the, rapid, technological, changes, underway, in, propulsion, from, coal, to, oil, and, from, reciprocating, engines, to, turbines, ordnance, with, better, fire, directors, and, new, high, explosives, and, armor, and, the, emergence, of, new, craft, such, as, destroyers, and, submarines, mahan, s, emphasis, on, the, capital, ship, and, the, command, of, the, sea, came, at, an, opportune, moment, mahan, s, name, became, a, household, word, in, the, imperial, german, navy, after, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, ordered, his, officers, to, read, mahan, and, admiral, alfred, von, tirpitz, 1849, 1930, used, mahan, s, reputation, to, finance, a, powerful, high, seas, fleet, tirpitz, an, intense, navalist, who, believed, ardently, in, mahan, s, dictum, that, whatever, power, rules, the, sea, also, ruled, the, world, had, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, translated, into, german, in, 1898, and, had, 8, 000, copies, distributed, for, free, as, a, way, of, pressuring, the, reichstag, to, vote, for, the, first, navy, bill, tirpitz, used, mahan, not, only, as, a, way, of, winning, over, german, public, opinion, but, also, as, a, guide, to, strategic, thinking, before, 1914, tirpitz, completely, rejected, commerce, raiding, as, a, strategy, and, instead, embraced, mahan, s, ideal, of, a, decisive, battle, of, annihilation, between, two, fleets, as, the, way, to, win, command, of, the, seas, tirpitz, always, planned, for, the, german, high, seas, fleet, to, win, the, entscheidungsschlacht, decisive, battle, against, the, british, grand, fleet, somewhere, in, the, waters, between, helgoland, and, the, thames, a, strategy, he, based, on, his, reading, of, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, however, the, naval, warfare, of, world, war, i, proved, completely, different, than, german, planners, influenced, by, mahan, had, anticipated, because, the, royal, navy, avoided, open, battle, and, focused, on, blockading, germany, as, a, result, after, the, battles, of, heligoland, bight, and, dogger, bank, admiral, hugo, von, pohl, kept, most, of, germany, s, surface, fleet, at, its, north, sea, bases, in, 1916, his, successor, reinhard, scheer, tried, to, lure, the, grand, fleet, into, a, mahanian, decisive, battle, at, the, battle, of, jutland, but, the, engagement, ended, in, a, strategic, defeat, finally, as, the, german, army, neared, defeat, in, the, hundred, days, offensive, the, german, navy, s, high, command, without, informing, the, government, tried, to, mobilize, the, fleet, for, a, decisive, engagement, with, the, royal, navy, the, sailors, rebelled, in, the, kiel, mutiny, instigating, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, which, toppled, the, hohenzollern, monarchy, mahan, and, british, first, sea, lord, john, fisher, 1841, 1920, both, addressed, the, problem, of, how, to, dominate, home, waters, and, distant, seas, with, naval, forces, unable, to, do, both, mahan, argued, for, a, universal, principle, of, concentration, of, powerful, ships, in, home, waters, with, minimized, strength, in, distant, seas, fisher, instead, decided, to, use, submarines, to, defend, home, waters, and, mobile, battlecruisers, to, protect, british, interests, though, in, 1914, french, naval, doctrine, was, dominated, by, mahan, s, theory, of, sea, power, the, course, of, world, war, i, changed, ideas, about, the, place, of, the, navy, the, refusal, of, the, german, fleet, to, engage, in, a, decisive, battle, the, dardanelles, expedition, of, 1915, the, development, of, submarine, warfare, and, the, organization, of, convoys, all, showed, the, french, navy, s, new, role, in, combined, operations, with, the, french, army, the, navy, s, part, in, securing, victory, was, not, fully, understood, by, french, public, opinion, in, 1918, but, a, synthesis, of, old, and, new, ideas, arose, from, the, lessons, of, the, war, especially, by, admiral, raoul, castex, 1878, 1968, who, synthesized, in, his, five, volume, th, ories, strat, giques, the, classical, and, materialist, schools, of, naval, theory, he, reversed, mahan, s, theory, that, command, of, the, sea, precedes, maritime, communications, and, foresaw, the, enlarged, roles, of, aircraft, and, submarines, in, naval, warfare, the, influence, of, seapower, upon, history, 1660, 1783, was, translated, into, japanese, and, was, used, as, a, textbook, in, the, imperial, japanese, navy, ijn, that, usage, strongly, affected, the, ijn, s, plan, to, end, russian, naval, expansion, in, the, far, east, which, culminated, in, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 05, it, has, been, argued, that, the, ijn, s, pursuit, of, the, decisive, battle, kantai, kessen, contributed, to, imperial, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, because, the, development, of, the, submarine, and, the, aircraft, carrier, combined, with, advances, in, technology, largely, rendered, obsolete, the, doctrine, of, the, decisive, battle, between, fleets, nevertheless, the, ijn, did, not, adhere, strictly, to, mahanian, doctrine, because, its, forces, were, often, tactically, divided, particularly, during, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, the, battle, of, midway, mahan, believed, that, if, the, united, states, were, to, build, an, isthmian, canal, it, would, become, a, pacific, power, and, therefore, it, should, take, possession, of, hawaii, to, protect, the, west, coast, nevertheless, his, support, for, american, imperialism, was, more, ambivalent, than, is, often, stated, and, he, remained, lukewarm, about, american, annexation, of, the, philippines, mahan, was, a, major, influence, on, the, roosevelt, family, in, addition, to, theodore, he, corresponded, with, assistant, secretary, of, the, navy, franklin, d, roosevelt, until, his, death, in, 1914, during, world, war, ii, roosevelt, would, ignore, the, late, mahan, s, prior, advice, to, him, that, the, commonwealth, of, the, philippines, could, not, be, defended, against, an, imperial, japanese, invasion, leading, to, a, futile, defense, of, the, islands, against, the, japanese, philippines, campaign, between, 1889, and, 1892, mahan, was, engaged, in, special, service, for, the, bureau, of, navigation, and, in, 1893, he, was, appointed, to, command, the, powerful, new, protected, cruiser, chicago, on, a, visit, to, europe, where, he, was, feted, he, returned, to, lecture, at, the, war, college, and, then, in, 1896, he, retired, from, active, service, returning, briefly, to, duty, in, 1898, to, consult, on, naval, strategy, during, the, spanish, american, war, mahan, continued, to, write, and, he, received, honorary, degrees, from, oxford, cambridge, harvard, yale, columbia, dartmouth, and, mcgill, in, 1902, mahan, popularized, the, term, middle, east, which, he, used, in, the, article, the, persian, gulf, and, international, relations, published, in, september, in, the, national, review, as, a, delegate, to, the, 1899, hague, convention, mahan, argued, against, prohibiting, the, use, of, asphyxiating, gases, in, warfare, on, the, ground, that, such, weapons, would, inflict, such, terrible, casualties, that, belligerents, would, be, forced, to, end, wars, more, quickly, thus, providing, a, net, advantage, for, world, peace, in, 1902, mahan, was, elected, president, of, the, american, historical, association, and, his, address, subordination, in, historical, treatment, is, his, most, explicit, explanation, of, his, philosophy, of, history, in, 1906, mahan, became, rear, admiral, by, an, act, of, congress, that, promoted, all, retired, captains, who, had, served, in, the, american, civil, war, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, he, published, statements, favorable, to, the, cause, of, the, allies, but, in, an, attempt, to, enforce, american, neutrality, president, woodrow, wilson, ordered, that, all, active, and, retired, officers, refrain, from, publicly, commenting, on, the, war, mahan, was, reared, as, an, episcopalian, and, became, a, devout, churchman, with, high, church, sympathies, for, instance, late, in, life, he, strongly, opposed, revision, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, nevertheless, mahan, also, appears, to, have, undergone, a, conversion, experience, about, 1871, when, he, realized, that, he, could, experience, god, s, favor, not, through, his, own, merits, but, only, through, trust, in, the, completed, work, of, christ, on, the, cross, geissler, called, one, of, his, religious, addresses, almost, evangelical, albeit, of, the, dignified, stiff, upper, lip, variety, and, mahan, never, mentioned, a, conversion, experience, in, his, autobiography, in, later, life, mahan, often, spoke, to, episcopal, parishes, in, 1899, at, holy, trinity, church, in, brooklyn, mahan, emphasized, his, own, religious, experience, and, declared, that, one, needed, a, personal, relationship, with, god, given, through, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, in, 1909, mahan, published, the, harvest, within, thoughts, on, the, life, of, the, christian, which, was, part, personal, testimony, part, biblical, analysis, part, expository, sermon, mahan, died, in, washington, d, c, of, heart, failure, on, december, 1, 1914, a, few, months, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, alfred, thayer, mahan, married, ellen, lyle, evans, in, june, 1872, they, had, two, daughters, and, one, son, in, 1901, an, alternate, history, by, robert, conroy, the, main, character, is, a, young, united, states, army, officer, named, patrick, mahan, a, fictitious, nephew, of, admiral, mahan, who, himself, appears, briefly, in, the, story, as, well, in, harry, turtledove, s, southern, victory, another, alternate, history, mahan, is, frequently, mentioned, but, never, appears, he, is, spoken, of, as, having, been, president, of, the, united, states, from, 1889, to, 1897, and, the, mahan, bedroom, is, a, famous, room, in, the, powel, house, in, philadelphia, analogous, to, the, actual, lincoln, bedroom, in, the, white, house, as, president, mahan, prevented, the, construction, of, a, confederate, shipping, canal, in, nicaragua, and, opined, that, the, main, problem, with, republics, is, that, over, time, the, voters, are, apt, to, get, tired, of, paying, for, what, their, country, needs, to, defend, itself, the, protagonist, in, g, c, edmondson, s, novel, the, ship, that, sailed, the, time, stream, frequently, mentions, mahan, and, or, mahan, s, ghost, as, an, exclamation, in, the, riddle, of, the, sands, erskine, childers, has, his, character, davies, aimlessly, fingering, a, volume, of, mahan, notes, primary, sources
