limited, the, power, of, its, governors, after, this, tensions, between, the, two, states, further, decreased, while, the, saadian, government, further, stabilized, and, its, independence, became,

and, ottomans, against, one, another, al, mansur, excelled, in, the, art, of, the, balancing, of, power, through, diplomacy, eventually, he, spent, far, more, than, he, collected, in, revenue, he, attempted, to, expand, his, holdings, through, conquest, and, although, initially, successful, in, their, military, campaign, against, the, songhai, empire, the, moroccans, found, it, increasingly,
