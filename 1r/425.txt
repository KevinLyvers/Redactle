who, had, come, back, stage, has, taken, the, life, out, of, me, for, now, reitell, later, said, that, feltenstein, was, rather, a, wild, doctor, who, thought, injections, would, cure, anything, at, the, next, performance, on, 25, october, his, fellow, actors, realised, that, thomas, was, very, ill, he, was, desperately, ill, we, didn, t, think, that, he, would, be, able, to, do, the, last, performance, because, he, was, so, ill, dylan, literally, couldn, t, speak, he, was, so, ill, still, my, greatest, memory, of, it, is, that, he, had, no, voice, on, the, evening, of, 27, october,

ve, had, eighteen, straight, whiskies, i, think, that, s, the, record, the, barman, and, the, owner, of, the, pub, who, served, him, later, commented, that, thomas, could, not, have, drunk, more, than, half, that, amount, thomas, had, an, appointment, at, a, clam, house, in, new, jersey, with, ruthven, todd, on, 4, november, when, todd, telephoned, the, chelsea, that, morning, thomas, said, he, was, feeling, ill, and, postponed, the, engagement, todd, thought, he, sounded, terrible, the, poet, harvey, breit, was, another, to, phone, that, morning, he, thought, that, thomas, sounded, bad, thomas, s, voice, recalled, breit, was, low, and, hoarse, he, had, wanted, to, say, you, sound, as, though, from, the, tomb, but, instead, he, told, thomas, that, he, sounded, like, louis, armstrong, later, thomas, went, drinking, with, reitell, at, the, white, horse, and, feeling, sick, again, returned, to, the, hotel, feltenstein, came, to, see, him, three, times, that, day, administering, the, cortisone, secretant, acth, by, injection, and, on, his, third, visit, half, a, grain, 32, 4, milligrams, of, morphine, sulphate, this, amount, was, three, times, more, than, was, medically, appropriate, and, was, by, affecting, thomas, s, breathing, and, consequently, the, oxygen, supply, to, his, brain, the, precipitating, cause, of, his, death, after, reitell, became, increasingly, concerned, and, telephoned, feltenstein, for, advice, he, suggested, she, get, male, assistance, so, she, called, upon, the, painter, jack, heliker, who, arrived, before, 11, pm, at, midnight, on, 5, november, thomas, s, breathing, became, more, difficult, and, his, face, turned, blue, reitell, phoned, feltenstein, who, arrived, at, the, hotel, at, about, 1, am, and, called, for, an, ambulance, it, then, took, another, hour, for, the, ambulance, to, arrive, at, st, vincent, s, even, though, it, was, only, a, few, blocks, from, the, chelsea, thomas, was, admitted, to, the, emergency, ward, at, st, vincent, s, hospital, at, 1, 58, am, he, was, comatose, and, his, medical, notes, state, that, the, impression, upon, admission, was, acute, alcoholic, encephalopathy, damage, to, the, brain, by, alcohol, for, which, the, patient, was, treated, without, response, feltenstein, then, took, control, of, thomas, s, care, even, though, he, did, not, have, admitting, rights, at, st, vincent, s, the, hospital, s, senior, brain, specialist, c, g, gutierrez, mahoney, was, not, called, to, examine, thomas, until, the, afternoon, of, 6, november, some, 36, hours, after, thomas, s, admission, caitlin, having, flown, from, britain, arrived, at, the, hospital, the, following, morning, by, which, time, a, tracheotomy, had, been, performed, her, first, words, are, reported, to, have, been, is, the, bloody, man, dead, yet, permitted, to, see, thomas, for, a, short, time, she, returned, drunk, in, the, afternoon, and, made, threats, to, john, brinnin, feltenstein, had, her, put, into, a, straitjacket, and, committed, to, the, river, crest, sanitarium, it, is, now, believed, that, thomas, had, been, suffering, from, bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema, and, asthma, before, his, admission, to, st, vincent, s, in, their, 2004, paper, death, by, neglect, d, n, thomas, and, former, gp, principal, simon, barton, disclose, that, thomas, was, found, to, have, pneumonia, when, he, was, admitted, to, hospital, in, a, coma, doctors, took, three, hours, to, restore, his, breathing, using, artificial, respiration, and, oxygen, summarising, their, findings, they, conclude, the, medical, notes, indicate, that, on, admission, dylan, s, bronchial, disease, was, found, to, be, very, extensive, affecting, upper, mid, and, lower, lung, fields, both, left, and, right, the, forensic, pathologist, bernard, knight, who, examined, the, post, mortem, report, concurs, death, was, clearly, due, to, a, severe, lung, infection, with, extensive, advanced, bronchopneumonia, the, severity, of, the, chest, infection, with, greyish, consolidated, areas, of, well, established, pneumonia, suggests, that, it, had, started, before, admission, to, hospital, thomas, died, at, noon, on, 9, november, having, never, recovered, from, his, coma, a, nurse, and, the, poet, john, berryman, were, present, with, him, at, the, time, of, death, rumours, circulated, of, a, brain, haemorrhage, followed, by, competing, reports, of, a, mugging, or, even, that, thomas, had, drunk, himself, to, death, later, speculation, arose, about, drugs, and, diabetes, at, the, post, mortem, the, pathologist, found, three, causes, of, death, pneumonia, brain, swelling, and, a, fatty, liver, his, liver, showed, no, sign, of, cirrhosis, the, publication, of, john, brinnin, s, 1955, biography, dylan, thomas, in, america, cemented, thomas, s, reputation, as, a, roistering, drunken, and, doomed, poet, brinnin, focuses, on, thomas, s, last, few, years, and, paints, a, picture, of, him, as, a, drunk, and, a, philanderer, later, biographies, have, criticised, brinnin, s, view, especially, his, coverage, of, thomas, s, death, david, thomas, in, fatal, neglect, who, killed, dylan, thomas, writes, that, brinnin, along, with, reitell, and, feltenstein, were, culpable, fitzgibbon, s, 1965, biography, ignores, thomas, s, heavy, drinking, and, skims, over, his, death, giving, just, two, pages, in, his, detailed, book, to, thomas, s, demise, ferris, in, his, 1989, biography, includes, thomas, s, heavy, drinking, but, is, more, critical, of, those, around, him, in, his, final, days, and, does, not, draw, the, conclusion, that, he, drank, himself, to, death, many, sources, have, criticised, feltenstein, s, role, and, actions, especially, his, incorrect, diagnosis, of, delirium, tremens, and, the, high, dose, of, morphine, he, administered, dr, c, g, de, gutierrez, mahoney, the, doctor, who, treated, thomas, while, at, st, vincents, concluded, that, feltenstein, s, failure, to, see, that, thomas, was, gravely, ill, and, have, him, admitted, to, hospital, sooner, was, even, more, culpable, than, his, use, of, morphine, caitlin, thomas, s, autobiographies, leftover, life, to, kill, 1957, and, my, life, with, dylan, thomas, double, drink, story, 1997, describe, the, effects, of, alcohol, on, him, and, their, relationship, ours, was, not, only, a, love, story, it, was, a, drink, story, because, without, alcohol, it, would, never, had, got, on, its, rocking, feet, she, wrote, and, the, bar, was, our, altar, biographer, andrew, lycett, ascribed, the, decline, in, thomas, s, health, to, an, alcoholic, co, dependent, relationship, with, his, wife, who, deeply, resented, his, extramarital, affairs, in, contrast, dylan, biographers, andrew, sinclair, and, george, tremlett, express, the, view, that, thomas, was, not, an, alcoholic, tremlett, argues, that, many, of, thomas, s, health, issues, stemmed, from, undiagnosed, diabetes, thomas, died, intestate, with, assets, worth, 100, his, body, was, brought, back, to, wales, for, burial, in, the, village, churchyard, at, laugharne, thomas, s, funeral, which, brinnin, did, not, attend, took, place, at, st, martin, s, church, in, laugharne, on, 24, november, six, friends, from, the, village, carried, thomas, s, coffin, caitlin, without, her, customary, hat, walked, behind, the, coffin, with, his, childhood, friend, daniel, jones, at, her, arm, and, her, mother, by, her, side, the, procession, to, the, church, was, filmed, and, the, wake, took, place, at, brown, s, hotel, thomas, s, fellow, poet, and, long, time, friend, vernon, watkins, wrote, the, times, obituary, thomas, s, widow, caitlin, died, in, 1994, and, was, buried, alongside, him, thomas, s, father, dj, died, on, 16, december, 1952, and, his, mother, florence, in, august, 1958, thomas, s, elder, son, llewelyn, died, in, 2000, his, daughter, aeronwy, in, 2009, and, his, younger, son, colm, in, 2012, thomas, s, refusal, to, align, with, any, literary, group, or, movement, has, made, him, and, his, work, difficult, to, categorise, although, influenced, by, the, modern, symbolism, and, surrealism, movements, he, refused, to, follow, such, creeds, instead, critics, view, thomas, as, part, of, the, modernism, and, romanticism, movements, elder, olson, in, his, 1954, critical, study, of, thomas, s, poetry, wrote, of, a, further, characteristic, which, distinguished, thomas, s, work, from, that, of, other, poets, it, was, unclassifiable, olson, continued, that, in, a, postmodern, age, that, continually, attempted, to, demand, that, poetry, have, social, reference, none, could, be, found, in, thomas, s, work, and, that, his, work, was, so, obscure, that, critics, could, not, explicate, it, thomas, s, verbal, style, played, against, strict, verse, forms, such, as, in, the, villanelle, do, not, go, gentle, into, that, good, night, his, images, appear, carefully, ordered, in, a, patterned, sequence, and, his, major, theme, was, the, unity, of, all, life, the, continuing, process, of, life, and, death, and, new, life, that, linked, the, generations, thomas, saw, biology, as, a, magical, transformation, producing, unity, out, of, diversity, and, in, his, poetry, sought, a, poetic, ritual, to, celebrate, this, unity, he, saw, men, and, women, locked, in, cycles, of, growth, love, procreation, new, growth, death, and, new, life, therefore, each, image, engenders, its, opposite, thomas, derived, his, closely, woven, sometimes, self, contradictory, images, from, the, bible, welsh, folklore, preaching, and, sigmund, freud, explaining, the, source, of, his, imagery, thomas, wrote, in, a, letter, to, glyn, jones, my, own, obscurity, is, quite, an, unfashionable, one, based, as, it, is, on, a, preconceived, symbolism, derived, i, m, afraid, all, this, sounds, wooly, and, pretentious, from, the, cosmic, significance, of, the, human, anatomy, who, once, were, a, bloom, of, wayside, brides, in, the, hawed, house, and, heard, the, lewd, wooed, field, flow, to, the, coming, frost, the, scurrying, furred, small, friars, squeal, in, the, dowse, of, day, in, the, thistle, aisles, till, the, white, owl, crossed, from, in, the, white, giant, s, thigh, 1950, distinguishing, features, of, thomas, s, early, poetry, include, its, verbal, density, use, of, alliteration, sprung, rhythm, and, internal, rhyme, with, some, critics, detecting, the, influence, of, the, english, poet, gerard, manley, hopkins, this, is, attributed, to, hopkins, who, taught, himself, welsh, and, who, used, sprung, verse, bringing, some, features, of, welsh, poetic, metre, into, his, work, when, henry, treece, wrote, to, thomas, comparing, his, style, to, that, of, hopkins, thomas, wrote, back, denying, any, such, influence, thomas, greatly, admired, thomas, hardy, who, is, regarded, as, an, influence, when, thomas, travelled, in, america, he, recited, some, of, hardy, s, work, in, his, readings, other, poets, from, whom, critics, believe, thomas, drew, influence, include, james, joyce, arthur, rimbaud, and, d, h, lawrence, william, york, tindall, in, his, 1962, study, a, reader, s, guide, to, dylan, thomas, finds, comparison, between, thomas, s, and, joyce, s, wordplay, while, he, notes, the, themes, of, rebirth, and, nature, are, common, to, the, works, of, lawrence, and, thomas, although, thomas, described, himself, as, the, rimbaud, of, cwmdonkin, drive, he, stated, that, the, phrase, swansea, s, rimbaud, was, coined, by, poet, roy, campbell, critics, have, explored, the, origins, of, thomas, s, mythological, pasts, in, his, works, such, as, the, orchards, which, ann, elizabeth, mayer, believes, reflects, the, welsh, myths, of, the, mabinogion, thomas, s, poetry, is, notable, for, its, musicality, most, clear, in, fern, hill, in, country, sleep, ballad, of, the, long, legged, bait, and, in, the, white, giant, s, thigh, from, under, milk, wood, thomas, once, confided, that, the, poems, which, had, most, influenced, him, were, mother, goose, rhymes, which, his, parents, taught, him, when, he, was, a, child, i, should, say, i, wanted, to, write, poetry, in, the, beginning, because, i, had, fallen, in, love, with, words, the, first, poems, i, knew, were, nursery, rhymes, and, before, i, could, read, them, for, myself, i, had, come, to, love, the, words, of, them, the, words, alone, what, the, words, stood, for, was, of, a, very, secondary, importance, i, fell, in, love, that, is, the, only, expression, i, can, think, of, at, once, and, am, still, at, the, mercy, of, words, though, sometimes, now, knowing, a, little, of, their, behaviour, very, well, i, think, i, can, influence, them, slightly, and, have, even, learned, to, beat, them, now, and, then, which, they, appear, to, enjoy, i, tumbled, for, words, at, once, and, when, i, began, to, read, the, nursery, rhymes, for, myself, and, later, to, read, other, verses, and, ballads, i, knew, that, i, had, discovered, the, most, important, things, to, me, that, could, be, ever, thomas, became, an, accomplished, writer, of, prose, poetry, with, collections, such, as, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, dog, 1940, and, quite, early, one, morning, 1954, showing, he, was, capable, of, writing, moving, short, stories, his, first, published, prose, work, after, the, fair, appeared, in, the, new, english, weekly, on, 15, march, 1934, jacob, korg, believes, that, one, can, classify, thomas, s, fiction, work, into, two, main, bodies, vigorous, fantasies, in, a, poetic, style, and, after, 1939, more, straightforward, narratives, korg, surmises, that, thomas, approached, his, prose, writing, as, an, alternate, poetic, form, which, allowed, him, to, produce, complex, involuted, narratives, that, do, not, allow, the, reader, to, rest, not, for, the, proud, man, apart, from, the, raging, moon, i, write, on, these, spindrift, pages, nor, for, the, towering, dead, with, their, nightingales, and, psalms, but, for, the, lovers, their, arms, round, the, griefs, of, the, ages, who, pay, no, praise, or, wages, nor, heed, my, craft, or, art, from, in, my, craft, or, sullen, art, deaths, and, entrances, 1946, thomas, disliked, being, regarded, as, a, provincial, poet, and, decried, any, notion, of, welshness, in, his, poetry, when, he, wrote, to, stephen, spender, in, 1952, thanking, him, for, a, review, of, his, collected, poems, he, added, oh, i, forgot, i, m, not, influenced, by, welsh, bardic, poetry, i, can, t, read, welsh, despite, this, his, work, was, rooted, in, the, geography, of, wales, thomas, acknowledged, that, he, returned, to, wales, when, he, had, difficulty, writing, and, john, ackerman, argues, that, his, inspiration, and, imagination, were, rooted, in, his, welsh, background, caitlin, thomas, wrote, that, he, worked, in, a, fanatically, narrow, groove, although, there, was, nothing, narrow, about, the, depth, and, understanding, of, his, feelings, the, groove, of, direct, hereditary, descent, in, the, land, of, his, birth, which, he, never, in, thought, and, hardly, in, body, moved, out, of, head, of, programmes, wales, at, the, bbc, aneirin, talfan, davies, who, commissioned, several, of, thomas, s, early, radio, talks, believed, that, the, poet, s, whole, attitude, is, that, of, the, medieval, bards, kenneth, o, morgan, counter, argues, that, it, is, a, difficult, enterprise, to, find, traces, of, cynghanedd, consonant, harmony, or, cerdd, dafod, tongue, craft, in, thomas, s, poetry, instead, he, believes, his, work, especially, his, earlier, more, autobiographical, poems, are, rooted, in, a, changing, country, which, echoes, the, welshness, of, the, past, and, the, anglicisation, of, the, new, industrial, nation, rural, and, urban, chapel, going, and, profane, welsh, and, english, unforgiving, and, deeply, compassionate, fellow, poet, and, critic, glyn, jones, believed, that, any, traces, of, cynghanedd, in, thomas, s, work, were, accidental, although, he, felt, thomas, consciously, employed, one, element, of, welsh, metrics, that, of, counting, syllables, per, line, instead, of, feet, constantine, fitzgibbon, who, was, his, first, in, depth, biographer, wrote, no, major, english, poet, has, ever, been, as, welsh, as, dylan, although, thomas, had, a, deep, connection, with, wales, he, disliked, welsh, nationalism, he, once, wrote, land, of, my, fathers, and, my, fathers, can, keep, it, while, often, attributed, to, thomas, himself, this, line, actually, comes, from, the, character, owen, morgan, vaughan, in, the, screenplay, thomas, wrote, for, the, 1948, british, melodrama, the, three, weird, sisters, robert, pocock, a, friend, from, the, bbc, recalled, i, only, once, heard, dylan, express, an, opinion, on, welsh, nationalism, he, used, three, words, two, of, them, were, welsh, nationalism, although, not, expressed, as, strongly, glyn, jones, believed, that, he, and, thomas, s, friendship, cooled, in, the, later, years, as, he, had, not, rejected, enough, of, the, elements, that, thomas, disliked, welsh, nationalism, and, a, sort, of, hill, farm, morality, apologetically, in, a, letter, to, keidrych, rhys, editor, of, the, literary, magazine, wales, thomas, s, father, wrote, that, he, was, afraid, dylan, isn, t, much, of, a, welshman, though, fitzgibbon, asserts, that, thomas, s, negativity, towards, welsh, nationalism, was, fostered, by, his, father, s, hostility, towards, the, welsh, language, thomas, s, work, and, stature, as, a, poet, have, been, much, debated, by, critics, and, biographers, since, his, death, critical, studies, have, been, clouded, by, thomas, s, personality, and, mythology, especially, his, drunken, persona, and, death, in, new, york, when, seamus, heaney, gave, an, oxford, lecture, on, the, poet, he, opened, by, addressing, the, assembly, dylan, thomas, is, now, as, much, a, case, history, as, a, chapter, in, the, history, of, poetry, querying, how, thomas, the, poet, is, one, of, his, forgotten, attributes, david, holbrook, who, has, written, three, books, about, thomas, stated, in, his, 1962, publication, llareggub, revisited, the, strangest, feature, of, dylan, thomas, s, notoriety, not, that, he, is, bogus, but, that, attitudes, to, poetry, attached, themselves, to, him, which, not, only, threaten, the, prestige, effectiveness, and, accessibility, to, english, poetry, but, also, destroyed, his, true, voice, and, at, last, him, the, poetry, archive, notes, that, dylan, thomas, s, detractors, accuse, him, of, being, drunk, on, language, as, well, as, whiskey, but, whilst, there, s, no, doubt, that, the, sound, of, language, is, central, to, his, style, he, was, also, a, disciplined, writer, who, re, drafted, obsessively, many, critics, have, argued, that, thomas, s, work, is, too, narrow, and, that, he, suffers, from, verbal, extravagance, those, that, have, championed, his, work, have, found, the, criticism, baffling, robert, lowell, wrote, in, 1947, nothing, could, be, more, wrongheaded, than, the, english, disputes, about, dylan, thomas, s, greatness, he, is, a, dazzling, obscure, writer, who, can, be, enjoyed, without, understanding, kenneth, rexroth, said, on, reading, eighteen, poems, the, reeling, excitement, of, a, poetry, intoxicated, schoolboy, smote, the, philistine, as, hard, a, blow, with, one, small, book, as, swinburne, had, with, poems, and, ballads, philip, larkin, in, a, letter, to, kingsley, amis, in, 1948, wrote, that, no, one, can, stick, words, into, us, like, pins, like, he, can, but, followed, that, by, stating, that, he, doesn, t, use, his, words, to, any, advantage, amis, was, far, harsher, finding, little, of, merit, in, his, work, and, claiming, that, he, was, frothing, at, the, mouth, with, piss, in, 1956, the, publication, of, the, anthology, new, lines, featuring, works, by, the, british, collective, the, movement, which, included, amis, and, larkin, among, its, number, set, out, a, vision, of, modern, poetry, that, was, damning, towards, the, poets, of, the, 1940s, thomas, s, work, in, particular, was, criticised, david, lodge, writing, about, the, movement, in, 1981, stated, dylan, thomas, was, made, to, stand, for, everything, they, detest, verbal, obscurity, metaphysical, pretentiousness, and, romantic, rhapsodizing, despite, criticism, by, sections, of, academia, thomas, s, work, has, been, embraced, by, readers, more, so, than, many, of, his, contemporaries, and, is, one, of, the, few, modern, poets, whose, name, is, recognised, by, the, general, public, in, 2009, more, than, 18, 000, votes, were, cast, in, a, bbc, poll, to, find, the, uk, s, favourite, poet, thomas, was, placed, 10th, several, of, his, poems, have, passed, into, the, cultural, mainstream, and, his, work, has, been, used, by, authors, musicians, and, film, and, television, writers, the, bbc, radio, programme, desert, island, discs, in, which, guests, usually, choose, their, favourite, songs, has, heard, 50, participants, select, a, dylan, thomas, recording, john, goodby, states, that, this, popularity, with, the, reading, public, allows, thomas, s, work, to, be, classed, as, vulgar, and, common, goodby, also, cites, that, despite, a, brief, period, during, the, 1960s, when, thomas, was, considered, a, cultural, icon, the, poet, has, been, marginalized, in, critical, circles, due, to, his, exuberance, in, both, life, and, work, and, his, refusal, to, know, his, place, goodby, believes, that, thomas, has, been, mainly, snubbed, since, the, 1970s, and, has, become, an, embarrassment, to, twentieth, century, poetry, criticism, his, work, failing, to, fit, standard, narratives, and, thus, being, ignored, rather, than, studied, in, june, 2022, thomas, was, the, subject, of, bbc, radio, 4, s, in, our, time, in, swansea, s, maritime, quarter, are, the, dylan, thomas, theatre, home, of,
