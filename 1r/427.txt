he, did, encourage, william, in, his, reading, and, in, particular, set, him, to, commit, large, portions, of, verse, to, memory, including, works, by, milton, shakespeare, and, spenser, which,

with, france, forced, him, to, return, to, england, alone, the, following, year, the, circumstances, of, his, return, and, subsequent, behaviour, raised, doubts, about, his, declared, wish, to, marry, annette, however, he, supported, her, and, his, daughter, as, best, he, could, in, later, life, the, reign, of, terror, left, wordsworth, thoroughly, disillusioned, with, the, french, revolution, and, the, outbreak, of, armed, hostilities, between, britain, and, france, prevented, him, from, seeing, annette, and, his, daughter, for, some, years, with, the, peace, of, amiens, again, allowing, travel, to, france, in, 1802, wordsworth, and, his, sister, dorothy, visited, annette, and, caroline, in, calais, the, purpose, of, the, visit, was, to, prepare, annette, for, the, fact, of, his,

it, was, also, in, 1795, that, he, met, samuel, taylor, coleridge, in, somerset, the, two, poets, quickly, developed, a, close, friendship, for, two, years, from, 1795, william, and, his, sister, dorothy, lived, at, racedown, house, in, dorset, a, property, of, the, pinney, family, to, the, west, of, pilsdon, pen, they, walked, in, the, area, for, about, two, hours, daily, and, the, nearby, hills, consoled, dorothy, as, she, pined, for, the, fells, of, her, native, lakeland, she, wrote, we, have, hills, which, seen, from, a, distance, almost, take, the, character, of, mountains, some, cultivated, nearly, to, their, summits, others, in, their, wild, state, covered, with, furze, and, broom, these, delight, me, the, most, as, they, remind, me, of, our, native, wilds, in, 1797, the, pair, moved, to, alfoxton, house, somerset, just, a, few, miles, away, from, coleridge, s, home, in, nether, stowey, together, wordsworth, and, coleridge, with, insights, from, dorothy, produced, lyrical, ballads, 1798, an, important, work, in, the, english, romantic, movement, the, volume, gave, neither, wordsworth, s, nor, coleridge, s, name, as, author, one, of, wordsworth, s, most, famous, poems, tintern, abbey, was, published, in, this, collection, along, with, coleridge, s, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, the, second, edition, published, in, 1800, had, only, wordsworth, listed, as, the, author, and, included, a, preface, to, the, poems, it, was, augmented, significantly, in, the, next, edition, published, in, 1802, in, this, preface, which, some, scholars, consider, a, central, work, of, romantic, literary, theory, wordsworth, discusses, what, he, sees, as, the, elements, of, a, new, type, of, verse, one, that, is, based, on, the, ordinary, language, really, used, by, men, while, avoiding, the, poetic, diction, of, much, 18th, century, verse, wordsworth, also, gives, his, famous, definition, of, poetry, as, the, spontaneous, overflow, of, powerful, feelings, it, takes, its, origin, from, emotion, recollected, in, tranquility, and, calls, his, own, poems, in, the, book, experimental, a, fourth, and, final, edition, of, lyrical, ballads, was, published, in, 1805, between, 1795, and, 1797, wordsworth, wrote, his, only, play, the, borderers, a, verse, tragedy, set, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, iii, of, england, when, englishmen, in, the, north, country, came, into, conflict, with, scottish, border, reivers, he, attempted, to, get, the, play, staged, in, november, 1797, however, it, was, rejected, by, thomas, harris, the, manager, of, the, covent, garden, theatre, who, proclaimed, it, impossible, that, the, play, should, succeed, in, the, representation, the, rebuff, was, not, received, lightly, by, wordsworth, and, the, play, was, not, published, until, 1842, after, substantial, revisions, i, travelled, among, unknown, men, i, travelled, among, unknown, men, in, lands, beyond, the, sea, nor, england, did, i, know, till, then, what,

is, the, last, green, field, that, lucy, s, eyes, surveyed, wordsworth, dorothy, and, coleridge, travelled, to, germany, in, the, autumn, of, 1798, while, coleridge, was, intellectually, stimulated, by, the, journey, its, main, effect, on, wordsworth, was, to, produce, homesickness, during, the, harsh, winter, of, 1798, 99, wordsworth, lived, with, dorothy, in, goslar, and, despite, extreme, stress, and, loneliness, began, work, on, the, autobiographical, piece, that, was, later, titled, the, prelude, he, wrote, several, other, famous, poems, in, goslar, including, the, lucy, poems, in, the, autumn, of, 1799, wordsworth, and, his, sister, returned, to, england, and, visited, the, hutchinson, family, at, sockburn, when, coleridge, arrived, back, in, england, he, travelled, to, the, north, with, their, publisher, joseph, cottle, to, meet, wordsworth, and, undertake, a, proposed, tour, of, the, lake, district, this, was, the, immediate, cause, of, the, brother, and, sister, s, settling, at, dove, cottage, in, grasmere, in, the, lake, district, this, time, with, another, poet, robert, southey, nearby, wordsworth, coleridge, and, southey, came, to, be, known, as, the, lake, poets, throughout, this, period, many, of, wordsworth, s, poems, revolved, around, themes, of, death, endurance, separation, and, grief, in, 1802, lowther, s, heir, william, lowther, 1st, earl, of, lonsdale, paid, the, 4, 000, equivalent, to, 451, 114, in, 2023, owed, to, wordsworth, s, father, through, lowther, s, failure, to, pay, his, aide, it, was, this, repayment, that, afforded, wordsworth, the, financial, means, to, marry, on, 4, october, following, his, visit, with, dorothy, to, france, to, arrange, matters, with, annette, wordsworth, married, his, childhood, friend, mary, hutchinson, at, all, saints, church, brompton, dorothy, continued, to, live, with, the, couple, and, grew, close, to, mary, the, following, year, mary, gave, birth, to, the, first, of, five, children, three, of, whom, predeceased, her, and, william, wordsworth, had, for, years, been, making, plans, to, write, a, long, philosophical, poem, in, three, parts, which, he, intended, to, call, the, recluse, in, 1798, 99, he, started, an, autobiographical, poem, which, he, referred, to, as, the, poem, to, coleridge, and, which, he, planned, would, serve, as, an, appendix, to, a, larger, work, called, the, recluse, in, 1804, he, began, expanding, this, autobiographical, work, having, decided, to, make, it, a, prologue, rather, than, an, appendix, he, completed, this, work, now, generally, referred, to, as, the, first, version, of, the, prelude, in, 1805, but, refused, to, publish, such, a, personal, work, until, he, had, completed, the, whole, of, the, recluse, the, death, of, his, brother, john, also, in, 1805, affected, him, strongly, and, may, have, influenced, his, decisions, about, these, works, wordsworth, s, philosophical, allegiances, as, articulated, in, the, prelude, and, in, such, shorter, works, as, lines, written, a, few, miles, above, tintern, abbey, have, been, a, source, of, critical, debate, it, was, long, supposed, that, wordsworth, relied, chiefly, on, coleridge, for, philosophical, guidance, however, scholars, have, recently, suggested, that, wordsworth, s, ideas, may, have, been, formed, years, before, he, and, coleridge, became, friends, in, the, mid, 1790s, in, particular, while, he, was, in, revolutionary, paris, in, 1792, the, 22, year, old, wordsworth, met, the, mysterious, traveller, john, walking, stewart, 1747, 1822, who, was, nearing, the, end, of, his, thirty, years, of, wandering, on, foot, from, madras, india, through, persia, and, arabia, across, africa, and, europe, and, up, through, the, fledgling, united, states, by, the, time, of, their, association, stewart, had, published, an, ambitious, work, of, original, materialist, philosophy, entitled, the, apocalypse, of, nature, london, 1791, to, which, many, of, wordsworth, s, philosophical, sentiments, may, well, be, indebted, in, 1807, wordsworth, published, poems, in, two, volumes, including, ode, intimations, of, immortality, from, recollections, of, early, childhood, until, now, wordsworth, was, known, only, for, lyrical, ballads, and, he, hoped, this, new, collection, would, cement, his, reputation, its, reception, was, lukewarm, in, 1810, wordsworth, and, coleridge, were, estranged, over, the, latter, s, opium, addiction, and, in, 1812, his, son, thomas, died, at, the, age, of, 6, six, months, after, the, death, of, 3, year, old, catherine, the, following, year, he, received, an, appointment, as, distributor, of, stamps, for, westmorland, and, the, stipend, of, 400, a, year, made, him, financially, secure, albeit, at, the, cost, of, political, independence, in, 1813, he, and, his, family, including, dorothy, moved, to, rydal, mount, ambleside, between, grasmere, and, rydal, water, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1814, wordsworth, published, the, excursion, as, the, second, part, of, the, three, part, work, the, recluse, even, though, he, never, completed, the, first, or, third, parts, he, did, however, write, a, poetic, prospectus, to, the, recluse, in, which, he, laid, out, the, structure, and, intention, of, the, whole, work, the, prospectus, contains, some, of, wordsworth, s, most, famous, lines, on, the, relation, between, the, human, mind, and, nature, my, voice, proclaims, how, exquisitely, the, individual, mind, and, the, progressive, powers, perhaps, no, less, of, the, whole, species, to, the, external, world, is, fitted, and, how, exquisitely, too, theme, this, but, little, heard, of, among, men, the, external, world, is, fitted, to, the, mind, and, the, creation, by, no, lower, name, can, it, be, called, which, they, with, blended, might, accomplish, some, modern, critics, suggest, that, there, was, a, decline, in, his, work, beginning, around, the, mid, 1810s, perhaps, because, most, of, the, concerns, that, characterised, his, early, poems, loss, death, endurance, separation, and, abandonment, had, been, resolved, in, his, writings, and, his, life, by, 1820, he, was, enjoying, considerable, success, accompanying, a, reversal, in, the, contemporary, critical, opinion, of, his, earlier, works, the, poet, and, artist, william, blake, who, knew, wordsworth, s, work, was, struck, by, wordsworth, s, boldness, in, centring, his, poetry, on, the, human, mind, in, response, to, wordsworth, s, poetic, program, that, when, we, look, into, our, minds, into, the, mind, of, man, my, haunt, and, the, main, region, of, my, song, the, excursion, william, blake, wrote, to, his, friend, henry, crabb, robinson, that, the, passage, caused, him, a, bowel, complaint, which, nearly, killed, him, following, the, death, of, his, friend, the, painter, william, green, in, 1823, wordsworth, also, mended, his, relations, with, coleridge, the, two, were, fully, reconciled, by, 1828, when, they, toured, the, rhineland, together, dorothy, suffered, from, a, severe, illness, in, 1829, that, rendered, her, an, invalid, for, the, remainder, of, her, life, coleridge, and, charles, lamb, both, died, in, 1834, their, loss, being, a, difficult, blow, to, wordsworth, the, following, year, saw, the, passing, of, james, hogg, despite, the, death, of, many, contemporaries, the, popularity, of, his, poetry, ensured, a, steady, stream, of, young, friends, and, admirers, to, replace, those, he, lost, defunct, wordsworth, s, youthful, political, radicalism, unlike, coleridge, s, never, led, him, to, rebel, against, his, religious, upbringing, he, remarked, in, 1812, that, he, was, willing, to, shed, his, blood, for, the, established, church, of, england, reflected, in, his, ecclesiastical, sketches, of, 1822, this, religious, conservatism, also, colours, the, excursion, 1814, a, long, poem, that, became, extremely, popular, during, the, nineteenth, century, it, features, three, central, characters, the, wanderer, the, solitary, who, has, experienced, the, hopes, and, miseries, of, the, french, revolution, and, the, pastor, who, dominates, the, last, third, of, the, poem, behler, has, pointed, out, the, fact, that, wordsworth, wanted, to, invoke, the, basic, feeling, that, a, human, heart, possesses, and, expresses, he, had, reversed, the, philosophical, standpoint, expressed, by, his, friend, s, t, coleridge, of, creating, the, characters, in, such, an, environment, so, that, the, public, feels, them, belonging, to, the, distant, place, and, time, and, this, philosophical, realisation, by, wordsworth, indeed, allowed, him, to, choose, the, language, and, structural, patterning, of, the, poetry, that, a, common, person, used, every, day, kurland, wrote, that, the, conversational, aspect, of, a, language, emerges, through, social, necessity, social, necessity, posits, the, theme, of, possessing, the, proper, knowledge, interest, and, biases, also, among, the, speakers, william, wordsworth, has, used, conversation, in, his, poetry, to, let, the, poet, i, merge, into, we, the, poem, farewell, exposes, the, identical, emotion, that, the, poet, and, his, sister, nourish, we, leave, you, here, in, solitude, to, dwell, with, these, our, latest, gifts, of, tender, thought, thou, like, the, morning, in, thy, saffron, coat, bright, gowan, and, marsh, marigold, farewell, l, 19, 22, this, kind, of, conversational, tone, persists, throughout, the, poet, s, poetic, journey, which, positions, him, as, a, man, in, society, who, speaks, to, the, purpose, of, communion, with, the, very, common, mass, of, that, society, again, preface, to, lyrical, ballads, is, the, evidence, where, the, poet, expresses, why, he, is, writing, and, what, he, is, writing, and, what, purpose, it, will, serve, humanity, wordsworth, remained, a, formidable, presence, in, his, later, years, in, 1837, the, scottish, poet, and, playwright, joanna, baillie, reflected, on, her, long, acquaintance, with, wordsworth, he, looks, like, a, man, that, one, must, not, speak, to, unless, one, has, some, sensible, thing, to, say, however, he, does, occasionally, converse, cheerfully, well, and, when, one, knows, how, benevolent, excellent, he, is, it, disposes, one, to, be, very, much, pleased, with, him, in, 1838, wordsworth, received, an, honorary, doctorate, in, civil, law, from, the, university, of, durham, the, following, year, he, was, awarded, the, same, honorary, degree, by, the, university, of, oxford, when, john, keble, praised, him, as, the, poet, of, humanity, praise, greatly, appreciated, by, wordsworth, it, has, been, argued, that, wordsworth, was, a, significant, influence, on, keble, s, immensely, popular, book, of, devotional, poetry, the, christian, year, 1827, in, 1842, the, government, awarded, him, a, civil, list, pension, of, 300, a, year, following, the, death, of, robert, southey, in, 1843, wordsworth, became, poet, laureate, he, initially, refused, the, honour, saying, that, he, was, too, old, but, accepted, when, the, prime, minister, robert, peel, assured, him, that, you, shall, have, nothing, required, of, you, wordsworth, thus, became, the, only, poet, laureate, to, write, no, official, verses, the, sudden, death, of, his, daughter, dora, in, 1847, at, age, 42, was, difficult, for, the, ageing, poet, to, take, and, in, his, depression, he, ultimately, gave, up, writing, new, material, william, wordsworth, died, at, home, at, rydal, mount, from, an, aggravated, case, of, pleurisy, on, 23, april, 1850, and, was, buried, at, st, oswald, s, church, grasmere, his, widow, mary, published, his, lengthy, autobiographical, poem, to, coleridge, as, the, prelude,
