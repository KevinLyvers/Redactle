buonaccorsi, there, are, no, surviving, primary, documents, on, the, early, years, of, copernicus, s, childhood, and, education, copernicus, biographers, assume, that, watzenrode, first, sent, young, copernicus, to, st, john, s, school, at, toru, where, he, himself, had, been, a, master, later, according, to, armitage, the, boy, attended, the, cathedral, school, at, w, oc, awek, up, the, vistula, river, from, toru, which, prepared, pupils, for, entrance, to, the, university, of, krak, w, in, the, winter, semester, of, 1491, 92, copernicus, as, nicolaus, nicolai, de, thuronia, matriculated, together, with, his, brother, andrew, at, the, university, of, krak, w, copernicus, began, his, studies, in, the, department, of, arts, from, the, fall, of, 1491, presumably, until, the, summer, or, fall, of, 1495, in, the, heyday, of, the, krak, w, astronomical, mathematical, school, acquiring, the, foundations, for, his, subsequent, mathematical, achievements, according, to, a, later, but, credible, tradition, jan, bro, ek, copernicus, was, a, pupil, of, albert, brudzewski, who, by, then, from, 1491, was, a, professor, of, aristotelian, philosophy, but, taught, astronomy, privately, outside, the, university, copernicus, became, familiar, with, brudzewski, s, widely, read, commentary, to, georg, von, peuerbach, s, theoric, nov, planetarum, and, almost, certainly, attended, the, lectures, of, bernard, of, biskupie, and, wojciech, krypa, of, szamotu, y, and, probably, other, astronomical, lectures, by, jan, of, g, og, w, micha, of, wroc, aw, breslau, wojciech, of, pniewy, and, marcin, bylica, of, olkusz, copernicus, s, krak, w, studies, gave, him, a, thorough, grounding, in, the, mathematical, astronomy, taught, at, the, university, arithmetic, geometry, geometric, optics, cosmography, theoretical, and, computational, astronomy, and, a, good, knowledge, of, the, philosophical, and, natural, science, writings, of, aristotle, de, coelo, metaphysics, and, averroes, stimulating, his, interest, in, learning, and, making, him, conversant, with, humanistic, culture, copernicus, broadened, the, knowledge, that, he, took, from, the, university, lecture, halls, with, independent, reading, of, books, that, he, acquired, during, his, krak, w, years, euclid, haly, abenragel, the, alfonsine, tables, johannes, regiomontanus, tabulae, directionum, to, this, period, probably, also, date, his, earliest, scientific, notes, preserved, partly, at, uppsala, university, at, krak, w, copernicus, began, collecting, a, large, library, on, astronomy, it, would, later, be, carried, off, as, war, booty, by, the, swedes, during, the, deluge, in, the, 1650s, and, has, been, preserved, at, the, uppsala, university, library, copernicus, s, four, years, at, krak, w, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, his, critical, faculties, and, initiated, his, analysis, of, logical, contradictions, in, the, two, official, systems, of, astronomy, aristotle, s, theory, of, homocentric, spheres, and, ptolemy, s, mechanism, of, eccentrics, and, epicycles, the, surmounting, and, discarding, of, which, would, be, the, first, step, toward, the, creation, of, copernicus, s, own, doctrine, of, the, structure, of, the, universe, without, taking, a, degree, probably, in, the, fall, of, 1495, copernicus, left, krak, w, for, the, court, of, his, uncle, watzenrode, who, in, 1489, had, been, elevated, to, prince, bishop, of, warmia, and, soon, before, november, 1495, sought, to, place, his, nephew, in, the, warmia, canonry, vacated, by, 26, august, 1495, death, of, its, previous, tenant, jan, czanow, for, unclear, reasons, probably, due, to, opposition, from, part, of, the, chapter, who, appealed, to, rome, copernicus, s, installation, was, delayed, inclining, watzenrode, to, send, both, his, nephews, to, study, canon, law, in, italy, seemingly, with, a, view, to, furthering, their, ecclesiastic, careers, and, thereby, also, strengthening, his, own, influence, in, the, warmia, chapter, on, 20, october, 1497, copernicus, by, proxy, formally, succeeded, to, the, warmia, canonry, which, had, been, granted, to, him, two, years, earlier, to, this, by, a, document, dated, 10, january, 1503, at, padua, he, would, add, a, sinecure, at, the, collegiate, church, of, the, holy, cross, and, st, bartholomew, in, wroc, aw, at, the, time, in, the, crown, of, bohemia, despite, having, been, granted, a, papal, indult, on, 29, november, 1508, to, receive, further, benefices, through, his, ecclesiastic, career, copernicus, not, only, did, not, acquire, further, prebends, and, higher, stations, prelacies, at, the, chapter, but, in, 1538, he, relinquished, the, wroc, aw, sinecure, it, is, unclear, whether, he, was, ever, ordained, a, priest, edward, rosen, asserts, that, he, was, not, copernicus, did, take, minor, orders, which, sufficed, for, assuming, a, chapter, canonry, the, catholic, encyclopedia, proposes, that, his, ordination, was, probable, as, in, 1537, he, was, one, of, four, candidates, for, the, episcopal, seat, of, warmia, a, position, that, required, ordination, meanwhile, leaving, warmia, in, mid, 1496, possibly, with, the, retinue, of, the, chapter, s, chancellor, jerzy, pranghe, who, was, going, to, italy, in, the, fall, possibly, in, october, copernicus, arrived, in, bologna, and, a, few, months, later, after, 6, january, 1497, signed, himself, into, the, register, of, the, bologna, university, of, jurists, german, nation, which, included, young, poles, from, silesia, prussia, and, pomerania, as, well, as, students, of, other, nationalities, during, his, three, year, stay, at, bologna, which, occurred, between, fall, 1496, and, spring, 1501, copernicus, seems, to, have, devoted, himself, less, keenly, to, studying, canon, law, he, received, his, doctorate, in, canon, law, only, after, seven, years, following, a, second, return, to, italy, in, 1503, than, to, studying, the, humanities, probably, attending, lectures, by, filippo, beroaldo, antonio, urceo, called, codro, giovanni, garzoni, and, alessandro, achillini, and, to, studying, astronomy, he, met, the, famous, astronomer, domenico, maria, novara, da, ferrara, and, became, his, disciple, and, assistant, copernicus, was, developing, new, ideas, inspired, by, reading, the, epitome, of, the, almagest, epitome, in, almagestum, ptolemei, by, george, von, peuerbach, and, johannes, regiomontanus, venice, 1496, he, verified, its, observations, about, certain, peculiarities, in, ptolemy, s, theory, of, the, moon, s, motion, by, conducting, on, 9, march, 1497, at, bologna, a, memorable, observation, of, the, occultation, of, aldebaran, the, brightest, star, in, the, taurus, constellation, by, the, moon, copernicus, the, humanist, sought, confirmation, for, his, growing, doubts, through, close, reading, of, greek, and, latin, authors, pythagoras, aristarchos, of, samos, cleomedes, cicero, pliny, the, elder, plutarch, philolaus, heraclides, ecphantos, plato, gathering, especially, while, at, padua, fragmentary, historic, information, about, ancient, astronomical, cosmological, and, calendar, systems, copernicus, spent, the, jubilee, year, 1500, in, rome, where, he, arrived, with, his, brother, andrew, that, spring, doubtless, to, perform, an, apprenticeship, at, the, papal, curia, here, too, however, he, continued, his, astronomical, work, begun, at, bologna, observing, for, example, a, lunar, eclipse, on, the, night, of, 5, 6, november, 1500, according, to, a, later, account, by, rheticus, copernicus, also, probably, privately, rather, than, at, the, roman, sapienza, as, a, professor, mathematum, professor, of, astronomy, delivered, to, numerous, students, and, leading, masters, of, the, science, public, lectures, devoted, probably, to, a, critique, of, the, mathematical, solutions, of, contemporary, astronomy, on, his, return, journey, doubtless, stopping, briefly, at, bologna, in, mid, 1501, copernicus, arrived, back, in, warmia, after, on, 28, july, receiving, from, the, chapter, a, two, year, extension, of, leave, in, order, to, study, medicine, since, he, may, in, future, be, a, useful, medical, advisor, to, our, reverend, superior, and, the, gentlemen, of, the, chapter, in, late, summer, or, in, the, fall, he, returned, again, to, italy, probably, accompanied, by, his, brother, andrew, and, by, canon, bernhard, sculteti, this, time, he, studied, at, the, university, of, padua, famous, as, a, seat, of, medical, learning, and, except, for, a, brief, visit, to, ferrara, in, may, june, 1503, to, pass, examinations, for, and, receive, his, doctorate, in, canon, law, he, remained, at, padua, from, fall, 1501, to, summer, 1503, copernicus, studied, medicine, probably, under, the, direction, of, leading, padua, professors, bartolomeo, da, montagnana, girolamo, fracastoro, gabriele, zerbi, alessandro, benedetti, and, read, medical, treatises, that, he, acquired, at, this, time, by, valescus, de, taranta, jan, mesue, hugo, senensis, jan, ketham, arnold, de, villa, nova, and, michele, savonarola, which, would, form, the, embryo, of, his, later, medical, library, one, of, the, subjects, that, copernicus, must, have, studied, was, astrology, since, it, was, considered, an, important, part, of, a, medical, education, however, unlike, most, other, prominent, renaissance, astronomers, he, appears, never, to, have, practiced, or, expressed, any, interest, in, astrology, as, at, bologna, copernicus, did, not, limit, himself, to, his, official, studies, it, was, probably, the, padua, years, that, saw, the, beginning, of, his, hellenistic, interests, he, familiarized, himself, with, greek, language, and, culture, with, the, aid, of, theodorus, gaza, s, grammar, 1495, and, johannes, baptista, chrestonius, s, dictionary, 1499, expanding, his, studies, of, antiquity, begun, at, bologna, to, the, writings, of, bessarion, lorenzo, valla, and, others, there, also, seems, to, be, evidence, that, it, was, during, his, padua, stay, that, the, idea, finally, crystallized, of, basing, a, new, system, of, the, world, on, the, movement, of, the, earth, as, the, time, approached, for, copernicus, to, return, home, in, spring, 1503, he, journeyed, to, ferrara, where, on, 31, may, 1503, having, passed, the, obligatory, examinations, he, was, granted, the, degree, of, doctor, of, canon, law, nicolaus, copernich, de, prusia, jure, canonico, et, doctoratus, no, doubt, it, was, soon, after, at, latest, in, fall, 1503, that, he, left, italy, for, good, to, return, to, warmia, copernicus, made, three, observations, of, mercury, with, errors, of, 3, 15, and, 1, minutes, of, arc, he, made, one, of, venus, with, an, error, of, 24, minutes, four, were, made, of, mars, with, errors, of, 2, 20, 77, and, 137, minutes, four, observations, were, made, of, jupiter, with, errors, of, 32, 51, 11, and, 25, minutes, he, made, four, of, saturn, with, errors, of, 31, 20, 23, and, 4, minutes, with, novara, copernicus, observed, an, occultation, of, aldebaran, by, the, moon, on, 9, march, 1497, copernicus, also, observed, a, conjunction, of, saturn, and, the, moon, on, 4, march, 1500, he, saw, an, eclipse, of, the, moon, on, 6, november, 1500, having, completed, all, his, studies, in, italy, 30, year, old, copernicus, returned, to, warmia, where, he, would, live, out, the, remaining, 40, years, of, his, life, apart, from, brief, journeys, to, krak, w, and, to, nearby, prussian, cities, toru, thorn, gda, sk, danzig, elbl, g, elbing, grudzi, dz, graudenz, malbork, marienburg, k, nigsberg, kr, lewiec, the, prince, bishopric, of, warmia, enjoyed, substantial, autonomy, with, its, own, diet, parliament, and, monetary, unit, the, same, as, in, the, other, parts, of, royal, prussia, and, treasury, copernicus, was, his, uncle, s, secretary, and, physician, from, 1503, to, 1510, or, perhaps, until, his, uncle, s, death, on, 29, march, 1512, and, resided, in, the, bishop, s, castle, at, lidzbark, heilsberg, where, he, began, work, on, his, heliocentric, theory, in, his, official, capacity, he, took, part, in, nearly, all, his, uncle, s, political, ecclesiastic, and, administrative, economic, duties, from, the, beginning, of, 1504, copernicus, accompanied, watzenrode, to, sessions, of, the, royal, prussian, diet, held, at, malbork, and, elbl, g, and, write, dobrzycki, and, hajdukiewicz, participated, in, all, the, more, important, events, in, the, complex, diplomatic, game, that, ambitious, politician, and, statesman, played, in, defense, of, the, particular, interests, of, prussia, and, warmia, between, hostility, to, the, order, and, loyalty, to, the, polish, crown, in, 1504, 1512, copernicus, made, numerous, journeys, as, part, of, his, uncle, s, retinue, in, 1504, to, toru, and, gda, sk, to, a, session, of, the, royal, prussian, council, in, the, presence, of, poland, s, king, alexander, jagiellon, to, sessions, of, the, prussian, diet, at, malbork, 1506, elbl, g, 1507, and, sztum, stuhm, 1512, and, he, may, have, attended, a, pozna, posen, session, 1510, and, the, coronation, of, poland, s, king, sigismund, i, the, old, in, krak, w, 1507, watzenrode, s, itinerary, suggests, that, in, spring, 1509, copernicus, may, have, attended, the, krak, w, sejm, it, was, probably, on, the, latter, occasion, in, krak, w, that, copernicus, submitted, for, printing, at, jan, haller, s, press, his, translation, from, greek, to, latin, of, a, collection, by, the, 7th, century, byzantine, historian, theophylact, simocatta, of, 85, brief, poems, called, epistles, or, letters, supposed, to, have, passed, between, various, characters, in, a, greek, story, they, are, of, three, kinds, moral, offering, advice, on, how, people, should, live, pastoral, giving, little, pictures, of, shepherd, life, and, amorous, comprising, love, poems, they, are, arranged, to, follow, one, another, in, a, regular, rotation, of, subjects, copernicus, had, translated, the, greek, verses, into, latin, prose, and, he, published, his, version, as, theophilacti, scolastici, simocati, epistolae, morales, rurales, et, amatoriae, interpretatione, latina, which, he, dedicated, to, his, uncle, in, gratitude, for, all, the, benefits, he, had, received, from, him, with, this, translation, copernicus, declared, himself, on, the, side, of, the, humanists, in, the, struggle, over, the, question, of, whether, greek, literature, should, be, revived, copernicus, s, first, poetic, work, was, a, greek, epigram, composed, probably, during, a, visit, to, krak, w, for, johannes, dantiscus, epithalamium, for, barbara, zapolya, s, 1512, wedding, to, king, zygmunt, i, the, old, some, time, before, 1514, copernicus, wrote, an, initial, outline, of, his, heliocentric, theory, known, only, from, later, transcripts, by, the, title, perhaps, given, to, it, by, a, copyist, nicolai, copernici, de, hypothesibus, motuum, coelestium, a, se, constitutis, commentariolus, commonly, referred, to, as, the, commentariolus, it, was, a, succinct, theoretical, description, of, the, world, s, heliocentric, mechanism, without, mathematical, apparatus, and, differed, in, some, important, details, of, geometric, construction, from, de, revolutionibus, but, it, was, already, based, on, the, same, assumptions, regarding, earth, s, triple, motions, the, commentariolus, which, copernicus, consciously, saw, as, merely, a, first, sketch, for, his, planned, book, was, not, intended, for, printed, distribution, he, made, only, a, very, few, manuscript, copies, available, to, his, closest, acquaintances, including, it, seems, several, krak, w, astronomers, with, whom, he, collaborated, in, 1515, 1530, in, observing, eclipses, tycho, brahe, would, include, a, fragment, from, the, commentariolus, in, his, own, treatise, astronomiae, instauratae, progymnasmata, published, in, prague, in, 1602, based, on, a, manuscript, that, he, had, received, from, the, bohemian, physician, and, astronomer, tade, h, jek, a, friend, of, rheticus, the, commentariolus, would, appear, complete, in, print, for, the, first, time, only, in, 1878, in, 1510, or, 1512, copernicus, moved, to, frombork, a, town, to, the, northwest, at, the, vistula, lagoon, on, the, baltic, sea, coast, there, in, april, 1512, he, participated, in, the, election, of, fabian, of, lossainen, as, prince, bishop, of, warmia, it, was, only, in, early, june, 1512, that, the, chapter, gave, copernicus, an, external, curia, a, house, outside, the, defensive, walls, of, the, cathedral, mount, in, 1514, he, purchased, the, northwestern, tower, within, the, walls, of, the, frombork, stronghold, he, would, maintain, both, these, residences, to, the, end, of, his, life, despite, the, devastation, of, the, chapter, s, buildings, by, a, raid, against, frauenburg, carried, out, by, the, teutonic, order, in, january, 1520, during, which, copernicus, s, astronomical, instruments, were, probably, destroyed, copernicus, conducted, astronomical, observations, in, 1513, 1516, presumably, from, his, external, curia, and, in, 1522, 1543, from, an, unidentified, small, tower, turricula, using, primitive, instruments, modeled, on, ancient, ones, the, quadrant, triquetrum, armillary, sphere, at, frombork, copernicus, conducted, over, half, of, his, more, than, 60, registered, astronomical, observations, having, settled, permanently, at, frombork, where, he, would, reside, to, the, end, of, his, life, with, interruptions, in, 1516, 1519, and, 1520, 21, copernicus, found, himself, at, the, warmia, chapter, s, economic, and, administrative, center, which, was, also, one, of, warmia, s, two, chief, centers, of, political, life, in, the, difficult, politically, complex, situation, of, warmia, threatened, externally, by, the, teutonic, order, s, aggressions, attacks, by, teutonic, bands, the, polish, teutonic, war, of, 1519, 1521, albert, s, plans, to, annex, warmia, internally, subject, to, strong, separatist, pressures, the, selection, of, the, prince, bishops, of, warmia, currency, reform, he, together, with, part, of, the, chapter, represented, a, program, of, strict, cooperation, with, the, polish, crown, and, demonstrated, in, all, his, public, activities, the, defense, of, his, country, against, the, order, s, plans, of, conquest, proposals, to, unify, its, monetary, system, with, the, polish, crown, s, support, for, poland, s, interests, in, the, warmia, dominion, s, ecclesiastic, administration, that, he, was, consciously, a, citizen, of, the, polish, lithuanian, republic, soon, after, the, death, of, uncle, bishop, watzenrode, he, participated, in, the, signing, of, the, second, treaty, of, piotrk, w, trybunalski, 7, december, 1512, governing, the, appointment, of, the, bishop, of, warmia, declaring, despite, opposition, from, part, of, the, chapter, for, loyal, cooperation, with, the, polish, crown, that, same, year, before, 8, november, 1512, copernicus, assumed, responsibility, as, magister, pistoriae, for, administering, the, chapter, s, economic, enterprises, he, would, hold, this, office, again, in, 1530, having, already, since, 1511, fulfilled, the, duties, of, chancellor, and, visitor, of, the, chapter, s, estates, his, administrative, and, economic, duties, did, not, distract, copernicus, in, 1512, 1515, from, intensive, observational, activity, the, results, of, his, observations, of, mars, and, saturn, in, this, period, and, especially, a, series, of, four, observations, of, the, sun, made, in, 1515, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, variability, of, earth, s, eccentricity, and, of, the, movement, of, the, solar, apogee, in, relation, to, the, fixed, stars, which, in, 1515, 1519, prompted, his, first, revisions, of, certain, assumptions, of, his, system, some, of, the, observations, that, he, made, in, this, period, may, have, had, a, connection, with, a, proposed, reform, of, the, julian, calendar, made, in, the, first, half, of, 1513, at, the, request, of, the, bishop, of, fossombrone, paul, of, middelburg, their, contacts, in, this, matter, in, the, period, of, the, fifth, lateran, council, were, later, memorialized, in, a, complimentary, mention, in, copernicus, s, dedicatory, epistle, in, d, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, and, in, a, treatise, by, paul, of, middelburg, secundum, compendium, correctionis, calendarii, 1516, which, mentions, copernicus, among, the, learned, men, who, had, sent, the, council, proposals, for, the, calendar, s, emendation, during, 1516, 1521, copernicus, resided, at, olsztyn, allenstein, castle, as, economic, administrator, of, warmia, including, olsztyn, allenstein, and, pieni, no, mehlsack, while, there, he, wrote, a, manuscript, locationes, mansorum, desertorum, locations, of, deserted, fiefs, with, a, view, to, populating, those, fiefs, with, industrious, farmers, and, so, bolstering, the, economy, of, warmia, when, olsztyn, was, besieged, by, the, teutonic, knights, during, the, polish, teutonic, war, copernicus, directed, the, defense, of, olsztyn, and, warmia, by, royal, polish, forces, he, also, represented, the, polish, side, in, the, ensuing, peace, negotiations, copernicus, for, years, advised, the, royal, prussian, sejmik, on, monetary, reform, particularly, in, the, 1520s, when, that, was, a, major, question, in, regional, prussian, politics, in, 1526, he, wrote, a, study, on, the, value, of, money, monetae, cudendae, ratio, in, it, he, formulated, an, early, iteration, of, the, theory, called, gresham, s, law, that, bad, debased, coinage, drives, good, un, debased, coinage, out, of, circulation, several, decades, before, thomas, gresham, he, also, in, 1517, set, down, a, quantity, theory, of, money, a, principal, concept, in, modern, economics, copernicus, s, recommendations, on, monetary, reform, were, widely, read, by, leaders, of, both, prussia, and, poland, in, their, attempts, to, stabilize, currency, in, 1533, johann, widmanstetter, secretary, to, pope, clement, vii, explained, copernicus, s, heliocentric, system, to, the, pope, and, two, cardinals, the, pope, was, so, pleased, that, he, gave, widmanstetter, a, valuable, gift, in, 1535, bernard, wapowski, wrote, a, letter, to, a, gentleman, in, vienna, urging, him, to, publish, an, enclosed, almanac, which, he, claimed, had, been, written, by, copernicus, this, is, the, only, mention, of, a, copernicus, almanac, in, the, historical, records, the, almanac, was, likely, copernicus, s, tables, of, planetary, positions, wapowski, s, letter, mentions, copernicus, s, theory, about, the, motions, of, the, earth, nothing, came, of, wapowski, s, request, because, he, died, a, couple, of, weeks, later, following, the, death, of, prince, bishop, of, warmia, mauritius, ferber, 1, july, 1537, copernicus, participated, in, the, election, of, his, successor, johannes, dantiscus, 20, september, 1537, copernicus, was, one, of, four, candidates, for, the, post, written, in, at, the, initiative, of, tiedemann, giese, but, his, candidacy, was, actually, pro, forma, since, dantiscus, had, earlier, been, named, coadjutor, bishop, to, ferber, and, since, dantiscus, had, the, backing, of, poland, s, king, sigismund, i, at, first, copernicus, maintained, friendly, relations, with, the, new, prince, bishop, assisting, him, medically, in, spring, 1538, and, accompanying, him, that, summer, on, an, inspection, tour, of, chapter, holdings, but, that, autumn, their, friendship, was, strained, by, suspicions, over, copernicus, s, housekeeper, anna, schilling, whom, dantiscus, banished, from, frombork, in, spring, 1539, in, his, younger, days, copernicus, the, physician, had, treated, his, uncle, brother, and, other, chapter, members, in, later, years, he, was, called, upon, to, attend, the, elderly, bishops, who, in, turn, occupied, the, see, of, warmia, mauritius, ferber, and, johannes, dantiscus, and, in, 1539, his, old, friend, tiedemann, giese, bishop, of, che, mno, kulm, in, treating, such, important, patients, he, sometimes, sought, consultations, from, other, physicians, including, the, physician, to, duke, albert, and, by, letter, the, polish, royal, physician, in, the, spring, of, 1541, duke, albert, former, grand, master, of, the, teutonic, order, who, had, converted, the, monastic, state, of, the, teutonic, knights, into, a, lutheran, and, hereditary, realm, the, duchy, of, prussia, upon, doing, homage, to, his, uncle, the, king, of, poland, sigismund, i, summoned, copernicus, to, k, nigsberg, to, attend, the, duke, s, counselor, george, von, kunheim, who, had, fallen, seriously, ill, and, for, whom, the, prussian, doctors, seemed, unable, to, do, anything, copernicus, went, willingly, he, had, met, von, kunheim, during, negotiations, over, reform, of, the, coinage, and, copernicus, had, come, to, feel, that, albert, himself, was, not, such, a, bad, person, the, two, had, many, intellectual, interests, in, common, the, chapter, readily, gave, copernicus, permission, to, go, as, it, wished, to, remain, on, good, terms, with, the, duke, despite, his, lutheran, faith, in, about, a, month, the, patient, recovered, and, copernicus, returned, to, frombork, for, a, time, he, continued, to, receive, reports, on, von, kunheim, s, condition, and, to, send, him, medical, advice, by, letter, some, of, copernicus, s, close, friends, turned, protestant, but, copernicus, never, showed, a, tendency, in, that, direction, the, first, attacks, on, him, came, from, protestants, wilhelm, gnapheus, a, dutch, refugee, settled, in, elbl, g, wrote, a, comedy, in, latin, morosophus, the, foolish, sage, and, staged, it, at, the, latin, school, that, he, had, established, there, in, the, play, copernicus, was, caricatured, as, the, eponymous, morosophus, a, haughty, cold, aloof, man, who, dabbled, in, astrology, considered, himself, inspired, by, god, and, was, rumored, to, have, written, a, large, work, that, was, moldering, in, a, chest, elsewhere, protestants, were, the, first, to, react, to, news, of, copernicus, s, theory, melanchthon, wrote, some, people, believe, that, it, is, excellent, and, correct, to, work, out, a, thing, as, absurd, as, did, that, sarmatian, astronomer, who, moves, the, earth, and, stops, the, sun, indeed, wise, rulers, should, have, curbed, such, light, mindedness, nevertheless, in, 1551, eight, years, after, copernicus, s, death, astronomer, erasmus, reinhold, published, under, the, sponsorship, of, copernicus, s, former, military, adversary, the, protestant, duke, albert, the, prussian, tables, a, set, of, astronomical, tables, based, on, copernicus, s, work, astronomers, and, astrologers, quickly, adopted, it, in, place, of, its, predecessors, some, time, before, 1514, copernicus, made, available, to, friends, his, commentariolus, little, commentary, a, manuscript, describing, his, ideas, about, the, heliocentric, hypothesis, it, contained, seven, basic, assumptions, detailed, below, thereafter, he, continued, gathering, data, for, a, more, detailed, work, at, about, 1532, copernicus, had, basically, completed, his, work, on, the, manuscript, of, d, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, but, despite, urging, by, his, closest, friends, he, resisted, openly, publishing, his, views, not, wishing, as, he, confessed, to, risk, the, scorn, to, which, he, would, expose, himself, on, account, of, the, novelty, and, incomprehensibility, of, his, theses, in, 1533, johann, albrecht, widmannstetter, delivered, a, series, of, lectures, in, rome, outlining, copernicus, s, theory, pope, clement, vii, and, several, catholic, cardinals, heard, the, lectures, and, were, interested, in, the, theory, on, 1, november, 1536, cardinal, nikolaus, von, sch, nberg, archbishop, of, capua, wrote, to, copernicus, from, rome, some, years, ago, word, reached, me, concerning, your, proficiency, of, which, everybody, constantly, spoke, at, that, time, i, began, to, have, a, very, high, regard, for, you, for, i, had, learned, that, you, had, not, merely, mastered, the, discoveries, of, the, ancient, astronomers, uncommonly, well, but, had, also, formulated, a, new, cosmology, in, it, you, maintain, that, the, earth, moves, that, the, sun, occupies, the, lowest, and, thus, the, central, place, in, the, universe, therefore, with, the, utmost, earnestness, i, entreat, you, most, learned, sir, unless, i, inconvenience, you, to, communicate, this, discovery, of, yours, to, scholars, and, at, the, earliest, possible, moment, to, send, me, your, writings, on, the, sphere, of, the, universe, together, with, the, tables, and, whatever, else, you, have, that, is, relevant, to, this, subject, by, then, copernicus, s, work, was, nearing, its, definitive, form, and, rumors, about, his, theory, had, reached, educated, people, all, over, europe, despite, urgings, from, many, quarters, copernicus, delayed, publication, of, his, book, perhaps, from, fear, of, criticism, a, fear, delicately, expressed, in, the, subsequent, dedication, of, his, masterpiece, to, pope, paul, iii, scholars, disagree, on, whether, copernicus, s, concern, was, limited, to, possible, astronomical, and, philosophical, objections, or, whether, he, was, also, concerned, about, religious, objections, copernicus, was, still, working, on, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, even, if, not, certain, that, he, wanted, to, publish, it, when, in, 1539, georg, joachim, rheticus, a, wittenberg, mathematician, arrived, in, frombork, philipp, melanchthon, a, close, theological, ally, of, martin, luther, had, arranged, for, rheticus, to, visit, several, astronomers, and, study, with, them, rheticus, became, copernicus, s, pupil, staying, with, him, for, two, years, and, writing, a, book, narratio, prima, first, account, outlining, the, essence, of, copernicus, s, theory, in, 1542, rheticus, published, a, treatise, on, trigonometry, by, copernicus, later, included, as, chapters, 13, and, 14, of, book, i, of, de, revolutionibus, under, strong, pressure, from, rheticus, and, having, seen, the, favorable, first, general, reception, of, his, work, copernicus, finally, agreed, to, give, de, revolutionibus, to, his, close, friend, tiedemann, giese, bishop, of, che, mno, kulm, to, be, delivered, to, rheticus, for, printing, by, the, german, printer, johannes, petreius, at, nuremberg, n, rnberg, germany, while, rheticus, initially, supervised, the, printing, he, had, to, leave, nuremberg, before, it, was, completed, and, he, handed, over, the, task, of, supervising, the, rest, of, the, printing, to, a, lutheran, theologian, andreas, osiander, osiander, added, an, unauthorised, and, unsigned, preface, defending, copernicus, s, work, against, those, who, might, be, offended, by, its, novel, hypotheses, he, argued, that, different, hypotheses, are, sometimes, offered, for, one, and, the, same, motion, the, astronomer, will, take, as, his, first, choice, that, hypothesis, which, is, the, easiest, to, grasp, according, to, osiander, these, hypotheses, need, not, be, true, nor, even, probable, f, they, provide, a, calculus, consistent, with, the, observations, that, alone, is, enough, toward, the, close, of, 1542, copernicus, was, seized, with, apoplexy, and, paralysis, and, he, died, at, age, 70, on, 24, may, 1543, legend, has, it, that, he, was, presented, with, the, final, printed, pages, of, his, d, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, very, day, that, he, died, allowing, him, to, take, farewell, of, his, life, s, work, he, is, reputed, to, have, awoken, from, a, stroke, induced, coma, looked, at, his, book, and, then, died, peacefully, copernicus, was, reportedly, buried, in, frombork, cathedral, where, a, 1580, epitaph, stood, until, being, defaced, it, was, replaced, in, 1735, for, over, two, centuries, archaeologists, searched, the, cathedral, in, vain, for, copernicus, s, remains, efforts, to, locate, them, in, 1802, 1909, 1939, had, come, to, nought, in, 2004, a, team, led, by, jerzy, g, ssowski, head, of, an, archaeology, and, anthropology, institute, in, pu, tusk, began, a, new, search, guided, by, the, research, of, historian, jerzy, sikorski, in, august, 2005, after, scanning, beneath, the, cathedral, floor, they, discovered, what, they, believed, to, be, copernicus, s, remains, the, discovery, was, announced, only, after, further, research, on, 3, november, 2008, g, ssowski, said, he, was, almost, 100, percent, sure, it, is, copernicus, forensic, expert, capt, dariusz, zajdel, of, the, polish, police, central, forensic, laboratory, used, the, skull, to, reconstruct, a, face, that, closely, resembled, the, features, including, a, broken, nose, and, a, scar, above, the, left, eye, on, a, copernicus, self, portrait, the, expert, also, determined, that, the, skull, belonged, to, a, man, who, had, died, around, age, 70, copernicus, s, age, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, grave, was, in, poor, condition, and, not, all, the, remains, of, the, skeleton, were, found, missing, among, other, things, was, the, lower, jaw, the, dna, from, the, bones, found, in, the, grave, matched, hair, samples, taken, from, a, book, owned, by, copernicus, which, was, kept, at, the, library, of, the, university, of, uppsala, in, sweden, on, 22, may, 2010, copernicus, was, given, a, second, funeral, in, a, mass, led, by, j, zef, kowalczyk, the, former, papal, nuncio, to, poland, and, newly, named, primate, of, poland, copernicus, s, remains, were, reburied, in, the, same, spot, in, frombork, cathedral, where, part, of, his, skull, and, other, bones, had, been, found, a, black, granite, tombstone, identifies, him, as, the, founder, of, the, heliocentric, theory, and, also, a, church, canon, the, tombstone, bears, a, representation, of, copernicus, s, model, of, the, solar, system, a, golden, sun, encircled, by, six, of, the, planets, philolaus, c, 470, c, 385, bce, described, an, astronomical, system, in, which, a, central, fire, different, from, the, sun, occupied, the, centre, of, the, universe, and, a, counter, earth, the, earth, moon, the, sun, itself, planets, and, stars, all, revolved, around, it, in, that, order, outward, from, the, centre, heraclides, ponticus, 387, 312, bce, proposed, that, the, earth, rotates, on, its, axis, aristarchus, of, samos, c, 310, bce, c, 230, bce, was, the, first, to, advance, a, theory, that, the, earth, orbited, the, sun, further, mathematical, details, of, aristarchus, s, heliocentric, system, were, worked, out, around, 150, bce, by, the, hellenistic, astronomer, seleucus, of, seleucia, though, aristarchus, s, original, text, has, been, lost, a, reference, in, archimedes, book, the, sand, reckoner, archimedis, syracusani, arenarius, dimensio, circuli, describes, a, work, by, aristarchus, in, which, he, advanced, the, heliocentric, model, thomas, heath, gives, the, following, english, translation, of, archimedes, s, text, you, are, now, aware, that, the, universe, is, the, name, given, by, most, astronomers, to, the, sphere, the, centre, of, which, is, the, centre, of, the, earth, while, its, radius, is, equal, to, the, straight, line, between, the, centre, of, the, sun, and, the, centre, of, the, earth, this, is, the, common, account, as, you, have, heard, from, astronomers, but, aristarchus, has, brought, out, a, book, consisting, of, certain, hypotheses, wherein, it, appears, as, a, consequence, of, the, assumptions, made, that, the, universe, is, many, times, greater, than, the, universe, just, mentioned, his, hypotheses, are, that, the, fixed, stars, and, the, sun, remain, unmoved, that, the, earth, revolves, about, the, sun, on, the, circumference, of, a, circle, the, sun, lying, in, the, middle, of, the, orbit, and, that, the, sphere, of, the, fixed, stars, situated, about, the, same, centre, as, the, sun, is, so, great, that, the, circle, in, which, he, supposes, the, earth, to, revolve, bears, such, a, proportion, to, the, distance, of, the, fixed, stars, as, the, centre, of, the, sphere, bears, to, its, surface, in, an, early, unpublished, manuscript, of, de, revolutionibus, which, still, survives, copernicus, mentioned, the, non, heliocentric, moving, earth, theory, of, philolaus, and, the, possibility, that, aristarchus, also, had, a, moving, earth, theory, though, it, is, unlikely, that, he, was, aware, that, it, was, a, heliocentric, theory, he, removed, both, references, from, his, final, published, manuscript, copernicus, was, probably, aware, that, pythagoras, s, system, involved, a, moving, earth, the, pythagorean, system, was, mentioned, by, aristotle, copernicus, owned, a, copy, of, giorgio, valla, s, de, expetendis, et, fugiendis, rebus, which, included, a, translation, of, plutarch, s, reference, to, aristarchus, s, heliostaticism, in, copernicus, s, dedication, of, on, the, revolutions, to, pope, paul, iii, which, copernicus, hoped, would, dampen, criticism, of, his, heliocentric, theory, by, babblers, completely, ignorant, of, the, book, s, author, wrote, that, in, rereading, all, of, philosophy, in, the, pages, of, cicero, and, plutarch, he, had, found, references, to, those, few, thinkers, who, dared, to, move, the, earth, against, the, traditional, opinion, of, astronomers, and, almost, against, common, sense, the, prevailing, theory, during, copernicus, s, lifetime, was, the, one, that, ptolemy, published, in, his, almagest, c, 150, ce, the, earth, was, the, stationary, center, of, the, universe, stars, were, embedded, in, a, large, outer, sphere, that, rotated, rapidly, approximately, daily, while, each, of, the, planets, the, sun, and, the, moon, were, embedded, in, their, own, smaller, spheres, ptolemy, s, system, employed, devices, including, epicycles, deferents, and, equants, to, account, for, observations, that, the, paths, of, these, bodies, differed, from, simple, circular, orbits, centered, on, the, earth, beginning, in, the, 10th, century, a, tradition, criticizing, ptolemy, developed, within, islamic, astronomy, which, climaxed, with, ibn, al, haytham, of, basra, s, al, shuk, k, al, ba, alamiy, s, doubts, concerning, ptolemy, several, islamic, astronomers, questioned, the, earth, s, apparent, immobility, and, centrality, within, the, universe, some, accepted, that, the, earth, rotates, around, its, axis, such, as, abu, sa, id, al, sijzi, d, c, 1020, according, to, al, biruni, al, sijzi, invented, an, astrolabe, based, on, a, belief, held, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, that, the, motion, we, see, is, due, to, the, earth, s, movement, and, not, to, that, of, the, sky, that, others, besides, al, sijzi, held, this, view, is, further, confirmed, by, a, reference, from, an, arabic, work, in, the, 13th, century, which, states, according, to, the, geometers, muhandis, n, the, earth, is, in, constant, circular, motion, and, what, appears, to, be, the, motion, of, the, heavens, is, actually, due, to, the, motion, of, the, earth, and, not, the, stars, in, the, 12th, century, nur, ad, din, al, bitruji, proposed, a, complete, alternative, to, the, ptolemaic, system, although, not, heliocentric, he, declared, the, ptolemaic, system, as, an, imaginary, model, successful, at, predicting, planetary, positions, but, not, real, or, physical, al, bitruji, s, alternative, system, spread, through, most, of, europe, during, the, 13th, century, with, debates, and, refutations, of, his, ideas, continued, up, to, the, 16th, century, mathematical, techniques, developed, in, the, 13th, to, 14th, centuries, by, mo, ayyeduddin, al, urdi, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, and, ibn, al, shatir, for, geocentric, models, of, planetary, motions, closely, resemble, some, of, those, used, later, by, copernicus, in, his, heliocentric, models, copernicus, used, what, is, now, known, as, the, urdi, lemma, and, the, tusi, couple, in, the, same, planetary, models, as, found, in, arabic, sources, furthermore, the, exact, replacement, of, the, equant, by, two, epicycles, used, by, copernicus, in, the, commentariolus, was, found, in, an, earlier, work, by, ibn, al, shatir, d, c, 1375, of, damascus, ibn, al, shatir, s, lunar, and, mercury, models, are, also, identical, to, those, of, copernicus, this, has, led, some, scholars, to, argue, that, copernicus, must, have, had, access, to, some, yet, to, be, identified, work, on, the, ideas, of, those, earlier, astronomers, however, no, likely, candidate, for, this, conjectured, work, has, yet, come, to, light, and, other, scholars, have, argued, that, copernicus, could, well, have, developed, these, ideas, independently, of, the, late, islamic, tradition, nevertheless, copernicus, cited, some, of, the, islamic, astronomers, whose, theories, and, observations, he, used, in, de, revolutionibus, namely, al, battani, thabit, ibn, qurra, al, zarqali, averroes, and, al, bitruji, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, idea, of, the, tusi, couple, may, have, arrived, in, europe, leaving, few, manuscript, traces, since, it, could, have, occurred, without, the, translation, of, any, arabic, text, into, latin, one, possible, route, of, transmission, may, have, been, through, byzantine, science, gregory, chioniades, translated, some, of, al, tusi, s, works, from, arabic, into, byzantine, greek, several, byzantine, greek, manuscripts, containing, the, tusi, couple, are, still, extant, in, italy, copernicus, s, major, work, on, his, heliocentric, theory, was, d, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, celestial, spheres, published, in, the, year, of, his, death, 1543, he, had, formulated, his, theory, by, 1510, he, wrote, out, a, short, overview, of, his, new, heavenly, arrangement, also, probably, in, 1510, and, sent, it, off, to, at, least, one, correspondent, beyond, varmia, that, person, in, turn, copied, the, document, for, further, circulation, and, presumably, the, new, recipients, did, too, copernicus, s, commentariolus, summarized, his, heliocentric, theory, it, listed, the, assumptions, upon, which, the, theory, was, based, as, follows, de, revolutionibus, itself, was, divided, into, six, sections, or, parts, called, books, georg, joachim, rheticus, could, have, been, copernicus, s, successor, but, did, not, rise, to, the, occasion, erasmus, reinhold, could, have, been, his, successor, but, died, prematurely, the, first, of, the, great, successors, was, tycho, brahe, though, he, did, not, think, the, earth, orbited, the, sun, followed, by, johannes, kepler, who, had, collaborated, with, tycho, in, prague, and, benefited, from, tycho, s, decades, worth, of, detailed, observational, data, despite, the, near, universal, acceptance, later, of, the, heliocentric, idea, though, not, the, epicycles, or, the, circular, orbits, copernicus, s, theory, was, originally, slow, to, catch, on, scholars, hold, that, sixty, years, after, the, publication, of, the, revolutions, there, were, only, around, 15, astronomers, espousing, copernicanism, in, all, of, europe, thomas, digges, and, thomas, harriot, in, england, giordano, bruno, and, galileo, galilei, in, italy, diego, zuniga, in, spain, simon, stevin, in, the, low, countries, and, in, germany, the, largest, group, georg, joachim, rheticus, michael, maestlin, christoph, rothmann, who, may, have, later, recanted, and, johannes, kepler, additional, possibilities, are, englishman, william, gilbert, along, with, achilles, gasser, georg, vogelin, valentin, otto, and, tiedemann, giese, the, barnabite, priest, redento, baranzano, supported, copernicus, s, view, in, his, uranoscopia, 1617, but, was, forced, to, retract, it, arthur, koestler, in, his, popular, book, the, sleepwalkers, asserted, that, copernicus, s, book, had, not, been, widely, read, on, its, first, publication, this, claim, was, trenchantly, criticised, by, edward, rosen, and, has, been, decisively, disproved, by, owen, gingerich, who, examined, nearly, every, surviving, copy, of, the, first, two, editions, and, found, copious, marginal, notes, by, their, owners, throughout, many, of, them, gingerich, published, his, conclusions, in, 2004, in, the, book, nobody, read, the, intellectual, climate, of, the, time, remained, dominated, by, aristotelian, philosophy, and, the, corresponding, ptolemaic, astronomy, at, that, time, there, was, no, reason, to, accept, the, copernican, theory, except, for, its, mathematical, simplicity, tycho, brahe, s, system, that, the, earth, is, stationary, the, sun, revolves, about, the, earth, and, the, other, planets, revolve, about, the, sun, also, directly, competed, with, copernicus, s, it, was, only, a, half, century, later, with, the, work, of, kepler, and, galileo, that, any, substantial, evidence, defending, copernicanism, appeared, starting, from, the, time, when, galileo, formulated, the, principle, of, inertia, helped, to, explain, why, everything, would, not, fall, off, the, earth, if, it, were, in, motion, after, isaac, newton, formulated, the, universal, law, of, gravitation, and, the, laws, of, mechanics, which, unified, terrestrial, and, celestial, mechanics, was, the, heliocentric, view, generally, accepted, the, immediate, result, of, the, 1543, publication, of, copernicus, s, book, was, only, mild, controversy, at, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, neither, copernicus, s, theory, nor, calendar, reform, which, would, later, use, tables, deduced, from, copernicus, s, calculations, were, discussed, it, has, been, much, debated, why, it, was, not, until, six, decades, after, the, publication, of, de, revolutionibus, that, the, catholic, church, took, any, official, action, against, it, even, the, efforts, of, tolosani, going, unheeded, catholic, side, opposition, only, commenced, seventy, three, years, later, when, it, was, occasioned, by, galileo, the, first, notable, to, move, against, copernicanism, was, the, magister, of, the, holy, palace, i, e, the, catholic, church, s, chief, censor, dominican, bartolomeo, spina, who, expressed, a, desire, to, stamp, out, the, copernican, doctrine, but, with, spina, s, death, in, 1546, his, cause, fell, to, his, friend, the, well, known, theologian, astronomer, the, dominican, giovanni, maria, tolosani, of, the, convent, of, st, mark, in, florence, tolosani, had, written, a, treatise, on, reforming, the, calendar, in, which, astronomy, would, play, a, large, role, and, had, attended, the, fifth, lateran, council, 1512, 1517, to, discuss, the, matter, he, had, obtained, a, copy, of, de, revolutionibus, in, 1544, his, denunciation, of, copernicanism, was, written, a, year, later, in, 1545, in, an, appendix, to, his, unpublished, work, on, the, truth, of, sacred, scripture, emulating, the, rationalistic, style, of, thomas, aquinas, tolosani, sought, to, refute, copernicanism, by, philosophical, argument, copernicanism, was, absurd, according, to, tolosani, because, it, was, scientifically, unproven, and, unfounded, first, copernicus, had, assumed, the, motion, of, the, earth, but, offered, no, physical, theory, whereby, one, would, deduce, this, motion, no, one, realized, that, the, investigation, into, copernicanism, would, result, in, a, rethinking, of, the, entire, field, of, physics, second, tolosani, charged, that, copernicus, s, thought, process, was, backwards, he, held, that, copernicus, had, come, up, with, his, idea, and, then, sought, phenomena, that, would, support, it, rather, than, observing, phenomena, and, deducing, from, them, the, idea, of, what, caused, them, in, this, tolosani, was, linking, copernicus, s, mathematical, equations, with, the, practices, of, the, pythagoreans, whom, aristotle, had, made, arguments, against, which, were, later, picked, up, by, thomas, aquinas, it, was, argued, that, mathematical, numbers, were, a, mere, product, of, the, intellect, without, any, physical, reality, and, as, such, could, not, provide, physical, causes, in, the, investigation, of, nature, some, astronomical, hypotheses, at, the, time, such, as, epicycles, and, eccentrics, were, seen, as, mere, mathematical, devices, to, adjust, calculations, of, where, the, heavenly, bodies, would, appear, rather, than, an, explanation, of, the, cause, of, those, motions, as, copernicus, still, maintained, the, idea, of, perfectly, spherical, orbits, he, relied, on, epicycles, this, saving, the, phenomena, was, seen, as, proof, that, astronomy, and, mathematics, could, not, be, taken, as, serious, means, to, determine, physical, causes, tolosani, invoked, this, view, in, his, final, critique, of, copernicus, saying, that, his, biggest, error, was, that, he, had, started, with, inferior, fields, of, science, to, make, pronouncements, about, superior, fields, copernicus, had, used, mathematics, and, astronomy, to, postulate, about, physics, and, cosmology, rather, than, beginning, with, the, accepted, principles, of, physics, and, cosmology, to, determine, things, about, astronomy, and, mathematics, thus, copernicus, seemed, to, be, undermining, the, whole, system, of, the, philosophy, of, science, at, the, time, tolosani, held, that, copernicus, had, fallen, into, philosophical, error, because, he, had, not, been, versed, in, physics, and, logic, anyone, without, such, knowledge, would, make, a, poor, astronomer, and, be, unable, to, distinguish, truth, from, falsehood, because, copernicanism, had, not, met, the, criteria, for, scientific, truth, set, out, by, thomas, aquinas, tolosani, held, that, it, could, only, be, viewed, as, a, wild, unproven, theory, tolosani, recognized, that, the, ad, lectorem, preface, to, copernicus, s, book, was, not, actually, by, him, its, thesis, that, astronomy, as, a, whole, would, never, be, able, to, make, truth, claims, was, rejected, by, tolosani, though, he, still, held, that, copernicus, s, attempt, to, describe, physical, reality, had, been, faulty, he, found, it, ridiculous, that, ad, lectorem, had, been, included, in, the, book, unaware, that, copernicus, had, not, authorized, its, inclusion, tolosani, wrote, by, means, of, these, words, the, foolishness, of, this, book, s, author, is, rebuked, for, by, a, foolish, effort, he, tried, to, revive, the, weak, pythagorean, opinion, long, ago, deservedly, destroyed, since, it, is, expressly, contrary, to, human, reason, and, also, opposes, holy, writ, from, this, situation, there, could, easily, arise, disagreements, between, catholic, expositors, of, holy, scripture, and, those, who, might, wish, to, adhere, obstinately, to, this, false, opinion, tolosani, declared, nicolaus, copernicus, neither, read, nor, understood, the, arguments, of, aristotle, the, philosopher, and, ptolemy, the, astronomer, tolosani, wrote, that, copernicus, is, expert, indeed, in, the, sciences, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, but, he, is, very, deficient, in, the, sciences, of, physics, and, logic, moreover, it, appears, that, he, is, unskilled, with, regard, to, holy, scripture, since, he, contradicts, several, of, its, principles, not, without, danger, of, infidelity, to, himself, and, the, readers, of, his, book, his, arguments, have, no, force, and, can, very, easily, be, taken, apart, for, it, is, stupid, to, contradict, an, opinion, accepted, by, everyone, over, a, very, long, time, for, the, strongest, reasons, unless, the, impugner, uses, more, powerful, and, insoluble, demonstrations, and, completely, dissolves, the, opposed, reasons, but, he, does, not, do, this, in, the, least, tolosani, declared, that, he, had, written, against, copernicus, for, the, purpose, of, preserving, the, truth, to, the, common, advantage, of, the, holy, church, despite, this, his, work, remained, unpublished, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, received, serious, consideration, robert, westman, describes, it, as, becoming, a, dormant, viewpoint, with, no, audience, in, the, catholic, world, of, the, late, sixteenth, century, but, also, notes, that, there, is, some, evidence, that, it, did, become, known, to, tommaso, caccini, who, would, criticize, galileo, in, a, sermon, in, december, 1613, tolosani, may, have, criticized, the, copernican, theory, as, scientifically, unproven, and, unfounded, but, the, theory, also, conflicted, with, the, theology, of, the, time, as, can, be, seen, in, a, sample, of, the, works, of, john, calvin, in, his, commentary, on, genesis, he, said, that, we, indeed, are, not, ignorant, that, the, circuit, of, the, heavens, is, finite, and, that, the, earth, like, a, little, globe, is, placed, in, the, centre, in, his, commentary, on, psalms, 93, 1, he, states, that, the, heavens, revolve, daily, and, immense, as, is, their, fabric, and, inconceivable, the, rapidity, of, their, revolutions, we, experience, no, concussion, how, could, the, earth, hang, suspended, in, the, air, were, it, not, upheld, by, god, s, hand, by, what, means, could, it, maintain, itself, unmoved, while, the, heavens, above, are, in, constant, rapid, motion, did, not, its, divine, maker, fix, and, establish, it, one, sharp, point, of, conflict, between, copernicus, s, theory, and, the, bible, concerned, the, story, of, the, battle, of, gibeon, in, the, book, of, joshua, where, the, hebrew, forces, were, winning, but, whose, opponents, were, likely, to, escape, once, night, fell, this, is, averted, by, joshua, s, prayers, causing, the, sun, and, the, moon, to, stand, still, martin, luther, once, made, a, remark, about, copernicus, although, without, mentioning, his, name, according, to, anthony, lauterbach, while, eating, with, martin, luther, the, topic, of, copernicus, arose, during, dinner, on, 4, june, 1539, in, the, same, year, as, professor, george, joachim, rheticus, of, the, local, university, had, been, granted, leave, to, visit, him, luther, is, said, to, have, remarked, so, it, goes, now, whoever, wants, to, be, clever, must, agree, with, nothing, others, esteem, he, must, do, something, of, his, own, this, is, what, that, fellow, does, who, wishes, to, turn, the, whole, of, astronomy, upside, down, even, in, these, things, that, are, thrown, into, disorder, i, believe, the, holy, scriptures, for, joshua, commanded, the, sun, to, stand, still, and, not, the, earth, these, remarks, were, made, four, years, before, the, publication, of, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, and, a, year, before, rheticus, s, narratio, prima, in, john, aurifaber, s, account, of, the, conversation, luther, calls, copernicus, that, fool, rather, than, that, fellow, this, version, is, viewed, by, historians, as, less, reliably, sourced, luther, s, collaborator, philipp, melanchthon, also, took, issue, with, copernicanism, after, receiving, the, first, pages, of, narratio, prima, from, rheticus, himself, melanchthon, wrote, to, mithobius, physician, and, mathematician, burkard, mithob, of, feldkirch, on, 16, october, 1541, condemning, the, theory, and, calling, for, it, to, be, repressed, by, governmental, force, writing, certain, people, believe, it, is, a, marvelous, achievement, to, extol, so, crazy, a, thing, like, that, polish, astronomer, who, makes, the, earth, move, and, the, sun, stand, still, really, wise, governments, ought, to, repress, impudence, of, mind, it, had, appeared, to, rheticus, that, melanchton, would, understand, the, theory, and, would, be, open, to, it, this, was, because, melanchton, had, taught, ptolemaic, astronomy, and, had, even, recommended, his, friend, rheticus, to, an, appointment, to, the, deanship, of, the, faculty, of, arts, sciences, at, the, university, of, wittenberg, after, he, had, returned, from, studying, with, copernicus, rheticus, s, hopes, were, dashed, when, six, years, after, the, publication, of, de, revolutionibus, melanchthon, published, his, initia, doctrinae, physicae, presenting, three, grounds, to, reject, copernicanism, these, were, the, evidence, of, the, senses, the, thousand, year, consensus, of, men, of, science, and, the, authority, of, the, bible, blasting, the, new, theory, melanchthon, wrote, out, of, love, for, novelty, or, in, order, to, make, a, show, of, their, cleverness, some, people, have, argued, that, the, earth, moves, they, maintain, that, neither, the, eighth, sphere, nor, the, sun, moves, whereas, they, attribute, motion, to, the, other, celestial, spheres, and, also, place, the, earth, among, the, heavenly, bodies, nor, were, these, jokes, invented, recently, there, is, still, extant, archimedes, s, book, on, the, sand, reckoner, in, which, he, reports, that, aristarchus, of, samos, propounded, the, paradox, that, the, sun, stands, still, and, the, earth, revolves, around, the, sun, even, though, subtle, experts, institute, many, investigations, for, the, sake, of, exercising, their, ingenuity, nevertheless, public, proclamation, of, absurd, opinions, is, indecent, and, sets, a, harmful, example, melanchthon, went, on, to, cite, bible, passages, and, then, declare, encouraged, by, this, divine, evidence, let, us, cherish, the, truth, and, let, us, not, permit, ourselves, to, be, alienated, from, it, by, the, tricks, of, those, who, deem, it, an, intellectual, honor, to, introduce, confusion, into, the, arts, in, the, first, edition, of, initia, doctrinae, physicae, melanchthon, even, questioned, copernicus, s, character, claiming, his, motivation, was, either, from, love, of, novelty, or, from, desire, to, appear, clever, these, more, personal, attacks, were, largely, removed, by, the, second, edition, in, 1550, another, protestant, theologian, who, disparaged, heliocentrism, on, scriptural, grounds, was, john, owen, in, a, passing, remark, in, an, essay, on, the, origin, of, the, sabbath, he, characterised, the, late, hypothesis, fixing, the, sun, as, in, the, centre, of, the, world, as, being, built, on, fallible, phenomena, and, advanced, by, many, arbitrary, presumptions, against, evident, testimonies, of, scripture, in, roman, catholic, circles, copernicus, s, book, was, incorporated, into, scholarly, curricula, throughout, the, 16th, century, for, example, at, the, university, of, salamanca, in, 1561, it, became, one, of, four, text, books, that, students, of, astronomy, could, choose, from, and, in, 1594, it, was, made, mandatory, german, jesuit, nicolaus, serarius, was, one, of, the, first, catholics, to, write, against, copernicus, s, theory, as, heretical, citing, the, joshua, passage, in, a, work, published, in, 1609, 1610, and, again, in, a, book, in, 1612, in, his, 12, april, 1615, letter, to, a, catholic, defender, of, copernicus, paolo, antonio, foscarini, catholic, cardinal, robert, bellarmine, condemned, copernican, theory, writing, not, only, the, holy, fathers, but, also, the, modern, commentaries, on, genesis, the, psalms, ecclesiastes, and, joshua, you, will, find, all, agreeing, in, the, literal, interpretation, that, the, sun, is, in, heaven, and, turns, around, the, earth, with, great, speed, and, that, the, earth, is, very, far, from, heaven, and, sits, motionless, at, the, center, of, the, world, nor, can, one, answer, that, this, is, not, a, matter, of, faith, since, if, it, is, not, a, matter, of, faith, as, regards, the, topic, it, is, a, matter, of, faith, as, regards, the, speaker, and, so, it, would, be, heretical, to, say, that, abraham, did, not, have, two, children, and, jacob, twelve, as, well, as, to, say, that, christ, was, not, born, of, a, virgin, because, both, are, said, by, the, holy, spirit, through, the, mouth, of, prophets, and, apostles, one, year, later, the, roman, inquisition, prohibited, copernicus, s, work, nevertheless, the, spanish, inquisition, never, banned, the, de, revolutionibus, which, continued, to, be, taught, at, salamanca, perhaps, the, most, influential, opponent, of, the, copernican, theory, was, francesco, ingoli, a, catholic, priest, ingoli, wrote, a, january, 1616, essay, to, galileo, presenting, more, than, twenty, arguments, against, the, copernican, theory, though, it, is, not, certain, it, is, probable, that, he, was, commissioned, by, the, inquisition, to, write, an, expert, opinion, on, the, controversy, after, the, congregation, of, the, index, s, decree, against, copernicanism, on, 5, march, 1616, ingoli, was, officially, appointed, its, consultant, galileo, himself, was, of, the, opinion, that, the, essay, played, an, important, role, in, the, rejection, of, the, theory, by, church, authorities, writing, in, a, later, letter, to, ingoli, that, he, was, concerned, that, people, thought, the, theory, was, rejected, because, ingoli, was, right, ingoli, presented, five, physical, arguments, against, the, theory, thirteen, mathematical, arguments, plus, a, separate, discussion, of, the, sizes, of, stars, and, four, theological, arguments, the, physical, and, mathematical, arguments, were, of, uneven, quality, but, many, of, them, came, directly, from, the, writings, of, tycho, brahe, and, ingoli, repeatedly, cited, brahe, the, leading, astronomer, of, the, era, these, included, arguments, about, the, effect, of, a, moving, earth, on, the, trajectory, of, projectiles, and, about, parallax, and, brahe, s, argument, that, the, copernican, theory, required, that, stars, be, absurdly, large, two, of, ingoli, s, theological, issues, with, the, copernican, theory, were, common, catholic, beliefs, not, directly, traceable, to, scripture, the, doctrine, that, hell, is, located, at, the, center, of, earth, and, is, most, distant, from, heaven, and, the, explicit, assertion, that, earth, is, motionless, in, a, hymn, sung, on, tuesdays, as, part, of, the, liturgy, of, the, hours, of, the, divine, office, prayers, regularly, recited, by, priests, ingoli, cited, robert, bellarmine, in, regards, to, both, of, these, arguments, and, may, have, been, trying, to, convey, to, galileo, a, sense, of, bellarmine, s, opinion, ingoli, also, cited, genesis, 1, 14, where, god, places, lights, in, the, firmament, of, the, heavens, to, divide, the, day, from, the, night, ingoli, did, not, think, the, central, location, of, the, sun, in, the, copernican, theory, was, compatible, with, it, being, described, as, one, of, the, lights, placed, in, the, firmament, like, previous, commentators, ingoli, also, pointed, to, the, passages, about, the, battle, of, gibeon, he, dismissed, arguments, that, they, should, be, taken, metaphorically, saying, replies, which, assert, that, scripture, speaks, according, to, our, mode, of, understanding, are, not, satisfactory, both, because, in, explaining, the, sacred, writings, the, rule, is, always, to, preserve, the, literal, sense, when, it, is, possible, as, it, is, in, this, case, and, also, because, all, the, fathers, unanimously, take, this, passage, to, mean, that, the, sun, which, was, truly, moving, stopped, at, joshua, s, request, an, interpretation, that, is, contrary, to, the, unanimous, consent, of, the, fathers, is, condemned, by, the, council, of, trent, session, iv, in, the, decree, on, the, edition, and, use, of, the, sacred, books, furthermore, although, the, council, speaks, about, matters, of, faith, and, morals, nevertheless, it, cannot, be, denied, that, the, holy, fathers, would, be, displeased, with, an, interpretation, of, sacred, scriptures, which, is, contrary, to, their, common, agreement, however, ingoli, closed, the, essay, by, suggesting, galileo, respond, primarily, to, the, better, of, his, physical, and, mathematical, arguments, rather, than, to, his, theological, arguments, writing, let, it, be, your, choice, to, respond, to, this, either, entirely, of, in, part, clearly, at, least, to, the, mathematical, and, physical, arguments, and, not, to, all, even, of, these, but, to, the, more, weighty, ones, when, galileo, wrote, a, letter, in, reply, to, ingoli, years, later, he, in, fact, only, addressed, the, mathematical, and, physical, arguments, in, march, 1616, in, connection, with, the, galileo, affair, the, roman, catholic, church, s, congregation, of, the, index, issued, a, decree, suspending, de, revolutionibus, until, it, could, be, corrected, on, the, grounds, of, ensuring, that, copernicanism, which, it, described, as, a, false, pythagorean, doctrine, altogether, contrary, to, the, holy, scripture, would, not, creep, any, further, to, the, prejudice, of, catholic, truth, the, corrections, consisted, largely, of, removing, or, altering, wording, that, spoke, of, heliocentrism, as, a, fact, rather, than, a, hypothesis, the, corrections, were, made, based, largely, on, work, by, ingoli, on, the, orders, of, pope, paul, v, cardinal, robert, bellarmine, gave, galileo, prior, notice, that, the, decree, was, about, to, be, issued, and, warned, him, that, he, could, not, hold, or, defend, the, copernican, doctrine, the, corrections, to, de, revolutionibus, which, omitted, or, altered, nine, sentences, were, issued, four, years, later, in, 1620, in, 1633, galileo, galilei, was, convicted, of, grave, suspicion, of, heresy, for, following, the, position, of, copernicus, which, is, contrary, to, the, true, sense, and, authority, of, holy, scripture, and, was, placed, under, house, arrest, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, the, instance, of, roger, boscovich, the, catholic, church, s, 1758, index, of, prohibited, books, omitted, the, general, prohibition, of, works, defending, heliocentrism, but, retained, the, specific, prohibitions,

states, whose, mother, tongue, was, german, however, according, to, french, philosopher, alexandre, koyr, copernicus, s, registration, with, the, natio, germanorum, does, not, in, itself, imply, that, copernicus, considered, himself, german, since, students, from, prussia, and, silesia, were, routinely, so, categorized, which, carried, certain, privileges, that, made, it, a, natural, choice, for,

described, with, the, use, of, 19th, and, 20th, century, concepts, no, polish, texts, by, copernicus, survive, due, to, the, rarity, of, polish, language, in, literature, before, the, writings, of,

territory, that, belonged, to, poland, himself, being, of, mixed, polish, german, extraction, czes, aw, mi, osz, describes, the, debate, as, an, absurd, projection, of, a, modern, understanding, of,

in, his, era, was, largely, indifferent, to, nationality, being, a, local, patriot, who, considered, himself, prussian, mi, osz, and, davies, both, write, that, copernicus, had, a, german, language, cultural, background, while, his, working, language, was, latin, in, accord, with, the, usage, of, the, time, additionally, according, to, davies, there, is, ample, evidence, that, he, knew, the, polish, language, davies, concludes, that, taking, everything, into, consideration, there, is, good, reason, to, regard, him, both, as, a, german, and, as, a, pole, and, yet, in, the, sense, that,
