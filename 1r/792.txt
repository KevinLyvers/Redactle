thrown, into, prison, where, he, endured, three, years, he, described, his, pain, thus, when, you, see, the, jailer, you, abjectly, touch, the, ground, with, your, forehead, at, the, mere, sight, of, his, underlings, you, are, seized, with, terror, such, ignominy, can, never, be, wiped, away, sima, called, his, castration, the, worst, of, all, punishments, in, 96, bc, on, his, release, from,

being, castrated, as, sima, qian, himself, explained, in, his, letter, to, ren, an, if, even, the, lowest, slave, and, scullion, maid, can, bear, to, commit, suicide, why, should, not, one, like, myself, be, able, to, do, what, has, to, be, done, but, the, reason, i, have, not, refused, to, bear, these, ills, and, have, continued, to, live, dwelling, in, vileness, and, disgrace, without, taking, my, leave, is, that, i, grieve, that, i, have, things, in, my, heart, which, i, have, not, been, able, to, express, fully, and, i, am, shamed, to, think, that, after, i, am, gone, my, writings, will, not, be, known, to, posterity, too, numerous, to, record, are, the, men, of, ancient, times, who, were, rich, and, noble, and, whose, names, have, yet, vanished, away, it, is, only, those, who, were, masterful, and, sure, the, truly, extraordinary, men, who, are, still, remembered, i, too, have, ventured, not, to, be, modest, but, have, entrusted, myself, to, my, useless, writings, i, have, gathered, up, and, brought, together, the, old, traditions, of, the, world, which, were, scattered, and, lost, i, have, examined, the, deeds, and, events, of, the, past, and, investigated, the, principles, behind, their, success, and, failure, their, rise, and, decay, in, one, hundred, and, thirty, chapters, i, wished, to, examine, into, all, that, concerns, heaven, and, man, to, penetrate, the, changes, of, the, past, and, present, completing, all, as, the, work, of, one, family, but, before, i, had, finished, my, rough, manuscript, i, met, with, this, calamity, it, is, because, i, regretted, that, it, had, not, been, completed, that, i, submitted, to, the, extreme, penalty, without, rancor, when, i, have, truly, completed, this, work, i, shall, deposit, it, in, the, famous, mountain, if, it, may, be, handed, down, to, men, who, will, appreciate, it, and, penetrate, to, the, villages, and, great, cities, then, though, i, should, suffer, a, thousand, mutilations, what, regret, should, i, have, upon, his, release, from, prison, in, 97, 96, bc, sima, qian, continued, to, serve, in, the, han, court, as, zhongshuling, a, court, archivist, position, reserved, for, eunuchs, with, considerable, status, and, with, higher, pay, than, his, previous, position, of, historian, the, letter, to, ren, an, was, written, by, sima, qian, in, reply, to, ren, an, in, response, to, the, latter, s, involvement, in, crown, prince, liu, ju, s, rebellion, in, 91, bc, this, is, the, last, record, of, sima, qian, in, contemporary, documents, the, letter, is, a, reply, to, a, lost, letter, by, ren, an, to, sima, qian, perhaps, asking, sima, qian, to, intercede, on, his, behalf, as, ren, an, was, facing, execution, for, accusations, of, being, an, opportunist, and, displaying, equivocal, loyalty, to, the, emperor, during, the, rebellion, in, his, reply, sima, qian, stated, that, he, is, a, mutilated, man, with, no, influence, at, court, some, later, historians, claimed, that, sima, qian, himself, became, implicated, in, the, rebellion, as, a, result, of, his, friendship, with, ren, an, and, was, executed, as, part, of, the, purge, of, the, crown, prince, s, supporters, in, court, however, the, earliest, attested, record, of, this, account, dates, from, the, 4th, century, moreover, it, has, also, been, pointed, out, that, sima, qian, would, have, been, reluctant, to, render, substantive, aid, to, ren, an, given, the, severe, consequences, that, he, suffered, for, supporting, general, li, ling, as, well, as, ren, an, s, failure, to, act, on, his, behalf, during, the, li, ling, affair, although, there, are, many, theories, regarding, the, exact, dating, as, well, as, the, true, nature, and, purpose, of, the, letter, to, ren, an, one, common, interpretation, suggests, that, the, letter, in, part, tacitly, expressed, a, refusal, to, play, an, active, role, in, securing, a, reduced, punishment, for, ren, an, the, early, 20th, century, scholar, wang, guowei, stated, that, there, are, no, reliable, records, establishing, when, sima, qian, died, he, and, most, modern, historians, believe, that, sima, qian, spent, his, last, days, as, a, scholar, in, reclusion, y, nsh, after, leaving, the, han, court, perhaps, dying, around, the, same, time, as, emperor, wu, in, 87, 86, bc, although, the, style, and, form, of, chinese, historical, writings, varied, through, the, ages, records, of, the, grand, historian, shiji, has, defined, the, quality, and, style, from, then, onwards, before, sima, histories, were, written, as, certain, events, or, certain, periods, of, history, of, states, his, idea, of, a, general, history, affected, later, historiographers, like, zheng, qiao, in, writing, tongzhi, and, sima, guang, in, writing, zizhi, tongjian, the, chinese, historical, form, of, dynasty, history, or, jizhuanti, history, of, dynasties, was, codified, in, the, second, dynastic, history, by, ban, gu, s, book, of, han, but, historians, regard, sima, s, work, as, their, model, which, stands, as, the, official, format, of, the, history, of, china, the, shiji, comprises, 130, chapters, consisting, of, half, a, million, characters, the, jizhuanti, format, refers, to, the, organization, of, the, work, into, benji, or, basic, annals, chapters, containing, the, biographies, of, the, sovereigns, sons, of, heaven, organized, by, dynasty, and, liezhuan, or, ordered, biographies, chapters, containing, the, biographies, of, influential, non, nobles, sometimes, for, one, prominent, individual, but, often, for, two, or, more, people, who, in, sima, qian, s, judgment, played, similarly, important, roles, in, history, in, addition, to, these, namesake, categories, there, are, chapters, falling, under, the, categories, of, biao, or, tables, containing, graphical, chronologies, of, royalty, and, nobility, and, shu, or, treatises, consisting, of, essays, giving, a, historical, perspective, on, various, topics, like, music, ritual, or, economics, most, importantly, the, shijia, chapters, or, house, chronicles, document, important, events, in, the, histories, of, the, rulers, of, each, of, the, quasi, independent, states, of, the, zhou, dynasty, originally, serving, as, vassals, to, the, zhou, kings, as, well, as, the, histories, of, contemporary, aristocratic, houses, established, during, the, han, dynasty, in, all, the, records, consist, of, 12, basic, annals, 10, tables, 8, treatises, 30, house, chronicles, and, 70, ordered, biographies, the, last, of, the, ordered, biographies, is, the, postface, this, final, chapter, details, the, background, of, how, the, shiji, was, composed, and, compiled, and, gives, brief, justifications, for, the, inclusion, of, the, major, topics, events, and, individuals, in, the, work, as, part, of, the, background, the, postface, provides, a, short, sketch, of, the, history, of, the, sima, clan, from, legendary, times, to, his, father, sima, tan, it, also, details, the, dying, words, of, sima, tan, tearfully, exhorting, the, author, to, compose, the, present, work, and, contains, a, biographical, sketch, of, the, author, himself, the, postface, concludes, with, a, self, referential, description, of, the, postface, as, the, 70th, and, last, of, the, ordered, biographies, chapters, sima, was, greatly, influenced, by, confucius, s, spring, and, autumn, annals, which, on, the, surface, is, a, succinct, chronology, from, the, events, of, the, reigns, of, the, twelve, dukes, of, lu, from, 722, to, 484, bc, many, chinese, scholars, have, and, still, do, view, how, confucius, ordered, his, chronology, as, the, ideal, example, of, how, history, should, be, written, especially, with, regards, to, what, he, chose, to, include, and, to, exclude, and, his, choice, of, words, as, indicating, moral, judgments, seen, in, this, light, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, are, a, moral, guide, to, the, proper, way, of, living, sima, took, this, view, himself, as, he, explained, it, distinguishes, what, is, suspicious, and, doubtful, clarifies, right, and, wrong, and, settles, points, which, are, uncertain, it, calls, good, good, and, bad, bad, honours, the, worthy, and, condemns, the, unworthy, it, preserves, states, which, are, lost, and, restores, the, perishing, family, it, brings, to, light, what, was, neglected, and, restores, what, was, abandoned, sima, saw, the, shiji, as, being, in, the, same, tradition, as, he, explained, in, his, introduction, to, chapter, 61, of, the, shiji, where, he, wrote, some, people, say, it, is, heaven, s, way, without, distinction, of, persons, to, keep, the, good, perpetually, supplied, can, we, say, then, that, boyi, and, shuqi, were, good, men, or, not, they, clung, to, righteousness, and, were, pure, in, their, deeds, yet, they, starved, to, death, robber, zhi, day, after, day, killed, innocent, men, making, mincemeat, of, their, flesh, but, in, the, end, he, lived, to, a, great, old, age, for, what, virtue, did, he, deserve, this, i, find, myself, in, much, perplexity, is, this, so, called, way, of, heaven, right, or, wrong, to, resolve, this, theodical, problem, sima, argued, that, while, the, wicked, may, succeed, and, the, good, may, suffer, in, their, own, life, times, it, is, the, historian, who, ensures, that, in, the, end, good, triumphs, for, sima, the, writing, of, history, was, no, mere, antiquarian, pursuit, but, was, rather, a, vital, moral, task, as, the, historian, would, preserve, memory, and, thereby, ensure, the, ultimate, victory, of, good, over, evil, along, these, lines, sima, wrote, su, qin, and, his, two, brothers, all, achieved, fame, among, the, feudal, lords, as, itinerant, strategists, their, policies, laid, great, stress, upon, stratagems, and, shifts, of, power, but, because, su, qin, died, a, traitor, s, death, the, world, has, united, in, scoffing, at, him, and, has, been, loath, to, study, his, policies, su, qin, arose, from, the, humblest, beginnings, to, lead, the, six, states, in, the, vertical, alliance, and, this, is, evidence, that, he, possessed, an, intelligence, surpassing, the, ordinary, person, for, this, reason, i, have, set, forth, this, account, of, his, deeds, arranging, them, in, proper, chronological, order, so, that, he, may, not, forever, suffer, from, an, evil, reputation, and, be, known, for, nothing, else, such, a, moralizing, approach, to, history, with, the, historian, high, guiding, the, good, and, evil, to, provide, lessons, for, the, present, could, be, dangerous, for, the, historian, as, it, could, bring, down, the, wrath, of, the, state, onto, the, historian, as, happened, to, sima, himself, as, such, the, historian, had, to, tread, carefully, and, often, expressed, his, judgements, in, a, circuitous, way, designed, to, fool, the, censor, sima, himself, in, the, conclusion, to, chapter, 110, of, the, shiji, declared, that, he, was, writing, in, this, tradition, where, he, stated, when, confucius, wrote, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, he, was, very, open, in, treating, the, reigns, of, yin, and, huan, the, early, dukes, of, lu, but, when, he, came, to, the, later, period, of, dukes, ding, and, ai, his, writing, was, much, more, covert, because, in, the, latter, case, he, was, writing, about, his, own, times, he, did, not, express, his, judgements, frankly, but, used, subtle, and, guarded, language, bearing, this, in, mind, not, everything, that, sima, wrote, should, be, understood, as, conveying, didactical, moral, lessons, but, several, historians, have, suggested, that, parts, of, the, shiji, such, as, where, sima, placed, his, section, on, confucius, s, use, of, indirect, criticism, in, the, part, of, the, book, dealing, with, the, xiongnu, barbarians, might, indicate, his, disapproval, of, the, foreign, policy, of, the, emperor, wu, in, writing, shiji, sima, initiated, a, new, writing, style, by, presenting, history, in, a, series, of, biographies, his, work, extends, over, 130, chapters, not, in, historical, sequence, but, divided, into, particular, subjects, including, annals, chronicles, and, treatises, on, music, ceremonies, calendars, religion, economics, and, extended, biographies, sima, s, work, influenced, the, writing, style, of, other, histories, outside, of, china, as, well, such, as, the, goryeo, korean, history, the, samguk, sagi, sima, adopted, a, new, method, in, sorting, out, the, historical, data, and, a, new, approach, to, writing, historical, records, at, the, beginning, of, the, shiji, sima, declared, himself, a, follower, of, confucius, s, approach, in, the, analects, to, hear, much, but, leave, to, one, side, that, which, is, doubtful, and, speak, with, due, caution, concerning, the, remainder, reflecting, these, rigorous, analytic, methods, sima, declared, that, he, would, not, write, about, periods, of, history, where, there, was, insufficient, documentation, as, such, sima, wrote, the, ages, before, the, ch, in, dynasty, are, too, far, away, and, the, material, on, them, too, scanty, to, permit, a, detailed, account, of, them, here, in, the, same, way, sima, discounted, accounts, in, the, traditional, records, that, were, ridiculous, such, as, the, pretense, that, prince, tan, could, via, the, use, of, magic, make, the, clouds, rain, grain, and, horses, grow, horns, sima, constantly, compared, accounts, found, in, the, manuscripts, with, what, he, considered, reliable, sources, like, confucian, classics, like, the, book, of, odes, book, of, history, book, of, rites, book, of, music, book, of, changes, and, spring, and, autumn, annals, when, sima, encountered, a, story, that, could, not, be, cross, checked, with, the, confucian, classics, he, systemically, compared, the, information, with, other, documents, sima, mentioned, at, least, 75, books, he, used, for, cross, checking, furthermore, sima, often, questioned, people, about, historical, events, they, had, experienced, sima, mentioned, after, one, of, his, trips, across, china, that, when, i, had, occasion, to, pass, through, feng, and, beiyi, i, questioned, the, elderly, people, who, were, about, the, place, visited, the, old, home, of, xiao, he, cao, can, fan, kuai, and, xiahou, ying, and, learned, much, about, the, early, days, how, different, it, was, from, the, stories, one, hears, reflecting, the, traditional, chinese, reverence, for, age, sima, stated, that, he, preferred, to, interview, the, elderly, as, he, believed, that, they, were, the, most, likely, to, supply, him, with, correct, and, truthful, information, about, what, had, happened, in, the, past, during, one, of, this, trips, sima, mentioned, that, he, was, overcome, with, emotion, when, he, saw, the, carriage, of, confucius, together, with, his, clothes, and, various, other, personal, items, that, had, belonged, to, confucius, despite, his, very, large, debts, to, confucian, tradition, sima, was, an, innovator, in, four, ways, to, begin, with, sima, s, work, was, concerned, with, the, history, of, the, known, world, previous, chinese, historians, had, focused, on, only, one, dynasty, and, or, region, sima, s, history, of, 130, chapters, began, with, the, legendary, yellow, emperor, and, extended, to, his, own, time, and, covered, not, only, china, but, also, neighboring, nations, like, korea, and, vietnam, in, this, regard, sima, was, significant, as, the, first, chinese, historian, to, treat, the, peoples, living, to, the, north, of, the, great, wall, like, the, xiongnu, as, human, beings, who, were, implicitly, the, equals, of, the, middle, kingdom, instead, of, the, traditional, approach, which, had, portrayed, the, xiongnu, as, savages, who, had, the, appearance, of, humans, but, the, minds, of, animals, in, his, comments, about, the, xiongnu, sima, refrained, from, evoking, claims, about, the, innate, moral, superiority, of, the, han, over, the, northern, barbarians, that, were, the, standard, rhetorical, tropes, of, chinese, historians, in, this, period, likewise, sima, in, his, chapter, about, the, xiongnu, condemns, those, advisors, who, pursue, the, expediency, of, the, moment, that, is, advise, the, emperor, to, carry, policies, such, as, conquests, of, other, nations, that, bring, a, brief, moment, of, glory, but, burden, the, state, with, the, enormous, financial, and, often, human, costs, of, holding, on, to, the, conquered, land, sima, was, engaging, in, an, indirect, criticism, of, the, advisors, of, the, emperor, wu, who, were, urging, him, to, pursue, a, policy, of, aggression, towards, the, xiongnu, and, conquer, all, their, land, a, policy, to, which, sima, was, apparently, opposed, sima, also, broke, new, ground, by, using, more, sources, like, interviewing, witnesses, visiting, places, where, historical, occurrences, had, happened, and, examining, documents, from, different, regions, and, or, times, before, chinese, historians, had, tended, to, use, only, reign, histories, as, their, sources, the, shiji, was, further, very, novel, in, chinese, historiography, by, examining, historical, events, outside, of, the, courts, providing, a, broader, history, than, the, traditional, court, based, histories, had, done, lastly, sima, broke, with, the, traditional, chronological, structure, of, chinese, history, sima, instead, had, divided, the, shiji, into, five, divisions, the, basic, annals, which, comprised, the, first, 12, chapters, the, chronological, tables, which, comprised, the, next, 10, chapters, treatises, on, particular, subjects, which, make, up, 8, chapters, accounts, of, the, ruling, families, which, take, up, 30, chapters, and, biographies, of, various, eminent, people, which, are, the, last, 70, chapters, the, annals, follow, the, traditional, chinese, pattern, of, court, based, histories, of, the, lives, of, various, emperors, and, their, families, the, chronological, tables, are, graphs, recounting, the, political, history, of, china, the, treatises, are, essays, on, topics, such, as, astronomy, music, religion, hydraulic, engineering, and, economics, the, last, section, dealing, with, biographies, covers, individuals, judged, by, sima, to, have, made, a, major, impact, on, the, course, of, history, regardless, of, whether, they, were, of, noble, or, humble, birth, and, whether, they, were, born, in, the, central, states, the, periphery, or, barbarian, lands, unlike, traditional, chinese, historians, sima, went, beyond, the, androcentric, nobility, focused, histories, by, dealing, with, the, lives, of, women, and, men, such, as, poets, bureaucrats, merchants, comedians, jesters, assassins, and, philosophers, the, treatises, section, the, biographies, sections, and, the, annals, section, relating, to, the, qin, dynasty, as, a, former, dynasty, there, was, more, freedom, to, write, about, the, qin, than, there, was, about, the, reigning, han, dynasty, that, make, up, 40, of, the, shiji, have, aroused, the, most, interest, from, historians, and, are, the, only, parts, of, the, shiji, that, have, been, translated, into, english, when, sima, placed, his, subjects, was, often, his, way, of, expressing, obliquely, moral, judgements, empress, l, and, xiang, yu, were, the, effective, rulers, of, china, during, reigns, hui, of, the, han, and, yi, of, chu, respectively, so, sima, placed, both, their, lives, in, the, basic, annals, likewise, confucius, is, included, in, the, fourth, section, rather, the, fifth, where, he, properly, belonged, as, a, way, of, showing, his, eminent, virtue, the, structure, of, the, shiji, allowed, sima, to, tell, the, same, stories, in, different, ways, which, allowed, him, to, pass, his, moral, judgements, for, example, in, the, basic, annals, section, the, emperor, gaozu, is, portrayed, as, a, good, leader, whereas, in, the, section, dealing, with, his, rival, xiang, yu, the, emperor, is, portrayed, unflatteringly, likewise, the, chapter, on, xiang, presents, him, in, a, favorable, light, whereas, the, chapter, on, gaozu, portrays, him, in, more, darker, colors, at, the, end, of, most, of, the, chapters, sima, usually, wrote, a, commentary, in, which, he, judged, how, the, individual, lived, up, to, traditional, chinese, values, like, filial, piety, humility, self, discipline, hard, work, and, concern, for, the, less, fortunate, sima, analyzed, the, records, and, sorted, out, those, that, could, serve, the, purpose, of, shiji, he, intended, to, discover, the, patterns, and, principles, of, the, development, of, human, history, sima, also, emphasized, for, the, first, time, in, chinese, history, the, role, of, individual, men, in, affecting, the, historical, development, of, china, and, his, historical, perception, that, a, country, cannot, escape, from, the, fate, of, growth, and, decay, unlike, the, book, of, han, which, was, written, under, the, supervision, of, the, imperial, dynasty, shiji, was, a, privately, written, history, since, he, refused, to, write, shiji, as, an, official, history, covering, only, those, of, high, rank, the, work, also, covers, people, of, the, lower, classes, and, is, therefore, considered, a, veritable, record, of, the, darker, side, of, the, dynasty, in, sima, s, time, literature, and, history, were, not, seen, as, separate, disciplines, as, they, are, now, and, sima, wrote, his, magnum, opus, in, a, very, literary, style, making, extensive, use, of, irony, sarcasm, juxtaposition, of, events, characterization, direct, speech, and, invented, speeches, which, led, the, american, historian, jennifer, jay, to, describe, parts, of, the, shiji, as, reading, more, like, a, historical, novel, than, a, work, of, history, for, an, example, sima, tells, the, story, of, a, chinese, eunuch, named, zhonghang, yue, who, became, an, advisor, to, the, xiongnu, kings, sima, provides, a, long, dialogue, between, zhonghang, and, an, envoy, sent, by, the, emperor, wen, of, china, during, which, the, latter, disparages, the, xiongnu, as, savages, whose, customs, are, barbaric, while, zhonghang, defends, the, xiongnu, customs, as, either, justified, and, or, as, morally, equal, to, chinese, customs, at, times, even, morally, superior, as, zhonghang, draws, a, contrast, between, the, bloody, succession, struggles, in, china, where, family, members, would, murder, one, another, to, be, emperor, vs, the, more, orderly, succession, of, the, xiongnu, kings, the, american, historian, tamara, chin, wrote, that, though, zhonghang, did, exist, the, dialogue, is, merely, a, literacy, device, for, sima, to, make, points, that, he, could, not, otherwise, make, the, favorable, picture, of, the, traitor, zhonghang, who, went, over, to, the, xiongnu, who, bests, the, emperor, s, loyal, envoy, in, an, ethnographic, argument, about, what, is, the, morally, superior, nation, appears, to, be, sima, s, way, of, attacking, the, entire, chinese, court, system, where, the, emperor, preferred, the, lies, told, by, his, sycophantic, advisors, over, the, truth, told, by, his, honest, advisors, as, inherently, corrupt, and, depraved, the, point, is, reinforced, by, the, fact, that, sima, has, zhonghang, speak, the, language, of, an, idealized, confucian, official, whereas, the, emperor, s, envoy, s, language, is, dismissed, as, mere, twittering, and, chatter, elsewhere, in, the, shiji, sima, portrayed, the, xiongnu, less, favorably, so, the, debate, was, almost, certainly, more, sima, s, way, of, criticizing, the, chinese, court, system, and, less, genuine, praise, for, the, xiongnu, sima, has, often, been, criticized, for, historizing, myths, and, legends, as, he, assigned, dates, to, mythical, and, legendary, figures, from, ancient, chinese, history, together, with, what, appears, to, be, suspiciously, precise, genealogies, of, leading, families, over, the, course, of, several, millennia, including, his, own, where, he, traces, the, descent, of, the, sima, family, from, legendary, emperors, in, the, distant, past, however, archaeological, discoveries, in, recent, decades, have, confirmed, aspects, of, the, shiji, and, suggested, that, even, if, the, sections, of, the, shiji, dealing, with, the, ancient, past, are, not, totally, true, at, least, sima, wrote, down, what, he, believed, to, be, true, in, particular, archaeological, finds, have, confirmed, the, basic, accuracy, of, the, shiji, including, the, reigns, and, locations, of, tombs, of, ancient, rulers, sima, s, shiji, is, respected, as, a, model, of, biographical, literature, with, high, literary, value, and, still, stands, as, a, textbook, for, the, study, of, classical, chinese, sima, s, works, were, influential, to, chinese, writing, serving, as, ideal, models, for, various, types, of, prose, within, the, neo, classical, renaissance, movement, of, the, tang, song, period, the, great, use, of, characterisation, and, plotting, also, influenced, fiction, writing, including, the, classical, short, stories, of, the, middle, and, late, medieval, period, tang, ming, as, well, as, the, vernacular, novel, of, the, late, imperial, period, sima, had, immense, influence, on, historiography, not, only, in, china, but, also, in, japan, and, korea, for, centuries, afterwards, the, shiji, was, regarded, as, the, greatest, history, book, written, in, asia, sima, is, little, known, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, a, full, translation, of, the, shiji, in, english, has, not, yet, been, completed, his, influence, was, derived, primarily, from, the, following, elements, of, his, writing, his, skillful, depiction, of, historical, characters, using, details, of, their, speech, conversations, and, actions, his, innovative, use, of, informal, humorous, and, varied, language, and, the, simplicity, and, conciseness, of, his, style, even, the, 20th, century, literary, critic, lu, xun, regarded, shiji, as, the, historians, most, perfect, song, a, li, sao, without, the, rhyme, in, his, outline, of, chinese, literary, history, sima,

of, literary, prose, style, studied, widely, in, china, even, today, the, letter, to, ren, an, contains, the, quote, men, have, always, had, but, one, death, for, some, it, is, as, weighty, as, mount,
