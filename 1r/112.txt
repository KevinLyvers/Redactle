golden, age, in, paris, where, he, synthesized, the, art, forms, of, cubism, symbolism, and, fauvism, and, the, influence, of, fauvism, gave, rise, to, surrealism, yet, throughout, these, phases, of, his, style, he, remained, most, emphatically, a, jewish, artist, whose, work, was, one, long, dreamy, reverie, of, life, in, his, native, village, of, vitebsk, when, matisse, dies, pablo, picasso, remarked, in, the, 1950s, chagall, will, be, the, only, painter, left, who, understands, what, colour, really, is, marc, chagall, was, born, moishe, shagal, in, 1887, into, a, jewish, family, in, liozna, near, the, city, of, vitebsk, belarus, then, part, of, the, russian, empire, at, the, time, of, his, birth, vitebsk, s, population, was, about, 66, 000, half, of, the, population, was, jewish, a, picturesque, city, of, churches, and, synagogues, it, was, called, russian, toledo, by, artist, ilya, repin, after, the, cosmopolitan, city, of, the, former, spanish, empire, because, the, city, was, built, mostly, of, wood, little, of, it, survived, years, of, occupation, and, destruction, during, world, war, ii, chagall, was, the, eldest, of, nine, children, the, family, name, shagal, is, a, variant, of, the, name, segal, which, in, a, jewish, community, was, usually, borne, by, a, levitic, family, his, father, khatskl, zachar, shagal, was, employed, by, a, herring, merchant, and, his, mother, feige, ite, sold, groceries, from, their, home, his, father, worked, hard, carrying, heavy, barrels, earning, 20, roubles, each, month, the, average, wages, across, the, russian, empire, was, 13, roubles, a, month, chagall, wrote, of, those, early, years, day, after, day, winter, and, summer, at, six, o, clock, in, the, morning, my, father, got, up, and, went, off, to, the, synagogue, there, he, said, his, usual, prayer, for, some, dead, man, or, other, on, his, return, he, made, ready, the, samovar, drank, some, tea, and, went, to, work, hellish, work, the, work, of, a, galley, slave, why, try, to, hide, it, how, tell, about, it, no, word, will, ever, ease, my, father, s, lot, there, was, always, plenty, of, butter, and, cheese, on, our, table, buttered, bread, like, an, eternal, symbol, was, never, out, of, my, childish, hands, one, of, the, main, sources, of, income, for, the, jewish, population, of, the, town, was, from, the, manufacture, of, clothing, that, was, sold, throughout, the, russian, empire, they, also, made, furniture, and, various, agricultural, tools, from, the, late, 18th, century, to, the, first, world, war, the, imperial, russian, government, confined, jews, to, living, within, the, pale, of, settlement, which, included, modern, ukraine, belarus, poland, lithuania, and, latvia, almost, exactly, corresponding, to, the, territory, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, which, was, taken, over, by, imperial, russia, in, the, late, 18th, century, that, led, to, the, creation, of, jewish, market, villages, shtetls, throughout, today, s, eastern, europe, with, their, own, markets, schools, hospitals, and, other, community, institutions, 14, chagall, wrote, as, a, boy, i, felt, at, every, step, that, i, was, a, jew, people, made, me, feel, it, during, a, pogrom, chagall, wrote, that, the, street, lamps, are, out, i, feel, panicky, especially, in, front, of, butchers, windows, there, you, can, see, calves, that, are, still, alive, lying, beside, the, butchers, hatchets, and, knives, when, asked, by, some, pogromniks, jew, or, not, chagall, remembered, thinking, my, pockets, are, empty, my, fingers, sensitive, my, legs, weak, and, they, are, out, for, blood, my, death, would, be, futile, i, so, wanted, to, live, chagall, denied, being, a, jew, leading, the, pogromniks, to, shout, all, right, get, along, most, of, what, is, known, about, chagall, s, early, life, has, come, from, his, autobiography, my, life, in, it, he, described, the, major, influence, that, the, culture, of, hasidic, judaism, had, on, his, life, as, an, artist, chagall, related, how, he, realised, that, the, jewish, traditions, in, which, he, had, grown, up, were, fast, disappearing, and, that, he, needed, to, document, them, from, the, 1730s, vitebsk, itself, had, been, a, centre, of, that, culture, with, its, teachings, derived, from, the, kabbalah, chagall, scholar, susan, tumarkin, goodman, describes, the, links, and, sources, of, his, art, to, his, early, home, chagall, s, art, can, be, understood, as, the, response, to, a, situation, that, has, long, marked, the, history, of, russian, jews, though, they, were, cultural, innovators, who, made, important, contributions, to, the, broader, society, jews, were, considered, outsiders, in, a, frequently, hostile, society, chagall, himself, was, born, of, a, family, steeped, in, religious, life, his, parents, were, observant, hasidic, jews, who, found, spiritual, satisfaction, in, a, life, defined, by, their, faith, and, organized, by, prayer, 14, in, the, russian, empire, at, that, time, jewish, children, were, not, allowed, to, attend, regular, schools, and, universities, imposed, a, quota, on, jews, their, movement, within, the, city, was, also, restricted, chagall, therefore, received, his, primary, education, at, the, local, jewish, religious, school, where, he, studied, hebrew, and, the, bible, at, the, age, of, 13, his, mother, tried, to, enrol, him, in, a, regular, high, school, and, he, recalled, but, in, that, school, they, don, t, take, jews, without, a, moment, s, hesitation, my, courageous, mother, walks, up, to, a, professor, she, offered, the, headmaster, 50, roubles, to, let, him, attend, which, he, accepted, a, turning, point, of, his, artistic, life, came, when, he, first, noticed, a, fellow, student, drawing, baal, teshuva, writes, that, for, the, young, chagall, watching, someone, draw, was, like, a, vision, a, revelation, in, black, and, white, chagall, would, later, say, that, there, was, no, art, of, any, kind, in, his, family, s, home, and, the, concept, was, totally, alien, to, him, when, chagall, asked, the, schoolmate, how, he, learned, to, draw, his, friend, replied, go, and, find, a, book, in, the, library, idiot, choose, any, picture, you, like, and, just, copy, it, he, soon, began, copying, images, from, books, and, found, the, experience, so, rewarding, he, then, decided, he, wanted, to, become, an, artist, goodman, writes, that, chagall, eventually, confided, to, his, mother, i, want, to, be, a, painter, although, she, could, not, yet, understand, his, sudden, interest, in, art, or, why, he, would, choose, a, vocation, that, seemed, so, impractical, the, young, chagall, explained, there, s, a, place, in, town, if, i, m, admitted, and, if, i, complete, the, course, i, ll, come, out, a, regular, artist, i, d, be, so, happy, it, was, 1906, and, he, had, noticed, the, studio, of, yehuda, yuri, pen, a, realist, artist, who, operated, a, drawing, school, in, vitebsk, at, the, same, time, future, artists, el, lissitzky, and, ossip, zadkine, were, also, pen, s, students, due, to, chagall, s, youth, and, lack, of, income, pen, offered, to, teach, him, free, of, charge, however, after, a, few, months, at, the, school, chagall, realized, that, academic, portrait, painting, did, not, suit, him, goodman, notes, that, during, that, period, in, imperial, russia, jews, had, two, ways, to, join, the, art, world, one, was, to, hide, or, deny, one, s, jewish, roots, the, other, the, one, that, chagall, chose, was, to, cherish, and, publicly, express, one, s, jewish, roots, by, integrating, them, into, art, for, chagall, that, was, also, his, means, of, self, assertion, and, an, expression, of, principle, 14, chagall, biographer, franz, meyer, explains, that, with, the, connections, between, his, art, and, early, life, the, hassidic, spirit, is, still, the, basis, and, source, of, nourishment, for, his, art, lewis, adds, as, cosmopolitan, an, artist, as, he, would, later, become, his, storehouse, of, visual, imagery, would, never, expand, beyond, the, landscape, of, his, childhood, with, its, snowy, streets, wooden, houses, and, ubiquitous, fiddlers, scenes, of, childhood, so, indelibly, in, one, s, mind, and, to, invest, them, with, an, emotional, charge, so, intense, that, it, could, only, be, discharged, obliquely, through, an, obsessive, repetition, of, the, same, cryptic, symbols, and, ideograms, years, later, at, the, age, of, 57, while, living, in, the, united, states, chagall, confirmed, that, when, he, published, an, open, letter, entitled, to, my, city, vitebsk, why, why, did, i, leave, you, many, years, ago, you, thought, the, boy, seeks, something, seeks, such, a, special, subtlety, that, color, descending, like, stars, from, the, sky, and, landing, bright, and, transparent, like, snow, on, our, roofs, where, did, he, get, it, how, would, it, come, to, a, boy, like, him, i, don, t, know, why, he, couldn, t, find, it, with, us, in, the, city, in, his, homeland, maybe, the, boy, is, crazy, but, crazy, for, the, sake, of, art, you, thought, i, can, see, i, am, etched, in, the, boy, s, heart, but, he, is, still, flying, he, is, still, striving, to, take, off, he, has, wind, in, his, head, i, did, not, live, with, you, but, i, didn, t, have, one, single, painting, that, didn, t, breathe, with, your, spirit, and, reflection, in, 1906, he, moved, to, saint, petersburg, which, was, then, the, capital, of, the, russian, empire, and, the, center, of, the, country, s, artistic, life, with, famous, art, schools, since, jews, were, not, permitted, into, the, city, without, an, internal, passport, he, managed, to, get, a, temporary, passport, from, a, friend, he, enrolled, in, a, prestigious, art, school, and, studied, there, for, two, years, by, 1907, he, had, begun, painting, naturalistic, self, portraits, and, landscapes, chagall, was, an, active, member, of, the, irregular, freemasonic, lodge, the, grand, orient, of, russia, s, peoples, he, belonged, to, the, vitebsk, lodge, between, 1908, and, 1910, chagall, was, a, student, of, l, on, bakst, at, the, zvantseva, school, of, drawing, and, painting, while, in, saint, petersburg, he, discovered, experimental, theater, and, the, work, of, such, artists, as, paul, gauguin, bakst, also, jewish, was, a, designer, of, decorative, art, and, was, famous, as, a, draftsman, designer, of, stage, sets, and, costumes, for, the, ballets, russes, and, helped, chagall, by, acting, as, a, role, model, for, jewish, success, bakst, moved, to, paris, a, year, later, art, historian, raymond, cogniat, writes, that, after, living, and, studying, art, on, his, own, for, four, years, chagall, entered, into, the, mainstream, of, contemporary, art, his, apprenticeship, over, russia, had, played, a, memorable, initial, role, in, his, life, 30, chagall, stayed, in, saint, petersburg, until, 1910, often, visiting, vitebsk, where, he, met, bella, rosenfeld, in, my, life, chagall, described, his, first, meeting, her, her, silence, is, mine, her, eyes, mine, it, is, as, if, she, knows, everything, about, my, childhood, my, present, my, future, as, if, she, can, see, right, through, me, 22, bella, later, wrote, of, meeting, him, when, you, did, catch, a, glimpse, of, his, eyes, they, were, as, blue, as, if, they, d, fallen, straight, out, of, the, sky, they, were, strange, eyes, long, almond, shaped, and, each, seemed, to, sail, along, by, itself, like, a, little, boat, in, 1910, chagall, relocated, to, paris, to, develop, his, artistic, style, art, historian, and, curator, james, sweeney, notes, that, when, chagall, first, arrived, in, paris, cubism, was, the, dominant, art, form, and, french, art, was, still, dominated, by, the, materialistic, outlook, of, the, 19th, century, but, chagall, arrived, from, russia, with, a, ripe, color, gift, a, fresh, unashamed, response, to, sentiment, a, feeling, for, simple, poetry, and, a, sense, of, humor, he, adds, these, notions, were, alien, to, paris, at, that, time, and, as, a, result, his, first, recognition, came, not, from, other, painters, but, from, poets, such, as, blaise, cendrars, and, guillaume, apollinaire, 7, art, historian, jean, leymarie, observes, that, chagall, began, thinking, of, art, as, emerging, from, the, internal, being, outward, from, the, seen, object, to, the, psychic, outpouring, which, was, the, reverse, of, the, cubist, way, of, creating, he, therefore, developed, friendships, with, guillaume, apollinaire, and, other, avant, garde, artists, including, robert, delaunay, and, fernand, l, ger, baal, teshuva, writes, that, chagall, s, dream, of, paris, the, city, of, light, and, above, all, of, freedom, had, come, true, 33, his, first, days, were, a, hardship, for, the, 23, year, old, chagall, who, was, lonely, in, the, big, city, and, unable, to, speak, french, some, days, he, felt, like, fleeing, back, to, russia, as, he, daydreamed, while, he, painted, about, the, riches, of, slavic, folklore, his, hasidic, experiences, his, family, and, especially, bella, in, paris, he, enrolled, at, acad, mie, de, la, palette, an, avant, garde, school, of, art, where, the, painters, jean, metzinger, andr, dunoyer, de, segonzac, and, henri, le, fauconnier, taught, and, also, found, work, at, another, academy, he, would, spend, his, free, hours, visiting, galleries, and, salons, especially, the, louvre, artists, he, came, to, admire, included, rembrandt, the, le, nain, brothers, chardin, van, gogh, renoir, pissarro, matisse, gauguin, courbet, millet, manet, monet, delacroix, and, others, it, was, in, paris, that, he, learned, the, technique, of, gouache, which, he, used, to, paint, belarusian, scenes, he, also, visited, montmartre, and, the, latin, quarter, and, was, happy, just, breathing, parisian, air, baal, teshuva, describes, this, new, phase, in, chagall, s, artistic, development, chagall, was, exhilarated, intoxicated, as, he, strolled, through, the, streets, and, along, the, banks, of, the, seine, everything, about, the, french, capital, excited, him, the, shops, the, smell, of, fresh, bread, in, the, morning, the, markets, with, their, fresh, fruit, and, vegetables, the, wide, boulevards, the, caf, s, and, restaurants, and, above, all, the, eiffel, tower, another, completely, new, world, that, opened, up, for, him, was, the, kaleidoscope, of, colors, and, forms, in, the, works, of, french, artists, chagall, enthusiastically, reviewed, their, many, different, tendencies, having, to, rethink, his, position, as, an, artist, and, decide, what, creative, avenue, he, wanted, to, pursue, 33, during, his, time, in, paris, chagall, was, constantly, reminded, of, his, home, in, vitebsk, as, paris, was, also, home, to, many, painters, writers, poets, composers, dancers, and, other, migr, s, from, the, russian, empire, however, night, after, night, he, painted, until, dawn, only, then, going, to, bed, for, a, few, hours, and, resisted, the, many, temptations, of, the, big, city, at, night, 44, my, homeland, exists, only, in, my, soul, he, once, said, viii, he, continued, painting, jewish, motifs, and, subjects, from, his, memories, of, vitebsk, although, he, included, parisian, scenes, the, eiffel, tower, in, particular, along, with, portraits, many, of, his, works, were, updated, versions, of, paintings, he, had, made, in, russia, transposed, into, fauvist, or, cubist, keys, chagall, developed, a, whole, repertoire, of, quirky, motifs, ghostly, figures, floating, in, the, sky, the, gigantic, fiddler, dancing, on, miniature, dollhouses, the, livestock, and, transparent, wombs, and, within, them, tiny, offspring, sleeping, upside, down, the, majority, of, his, scenes, of, life, in, vitebsk, were, painted, while, living, in, paris, and, in, a, sense, they, were, dreams, notes, lewis, their, undertone, of, yearning, and, loss, with, a, detached, and, abstract, appearance, caused, apollinaire, to, be, struck, by, this, quality, calling, them, surnaturel, his, animal, human, hybrids, and, airborne, phantoms, would, later, become, a, formative, influence, on, surrealism, chagall, however, did, not, want, his, work, to, be, associated, with, any, school, or, movement, and, considered, his, own, personal, language, of, symbols, to, be, meaningful, to, himself, but, sweeney, notes, that, others, often, still, associate, his, work, with, illogical, and, fantastic, painting, especially, when, he, uses, curious, representational, juxtapositions, 10, sweeney, writes, that, this, is, chagall, s, contribution, to, contemporary, art, the, reawakening, of, a, poetry, of, representation, avoiding, factual, illustration, on, the, one, hand, and, non, figurative, abstractions, on, the, other, andr, breton, said, that, with, him, alone, the, metaphor, made, its, triumphant, return, to, modern, painting, 7, because, he, missed, his, fianc, e, bella, who, was, still, in, vitebsk, he, thought, about, her, day, and, night, writes, baal, teshuva, and, was, afraid, of, losing, her, chagall, decided, to, accept, an, invitation, from, a, noted, art, dealer, in, berlin, to, exhibit, his, work, his, intention, being, to, continue, on, to, belarus, marry, bella, and, then, return, with, her, to, paris, chagall, took, 40, canvases, and, 160, gouaches, watercolors, and, drawings, to, be, exhibited, the, exhibit, held, at, herwarth, walden, s, sturm, gallery, was, a, huge, success, the, german, critics, positively, sang, his, praises, after, the, exhibit, he, continued, on, to, vitebsk, where, he, planned, to, stay, only, long, enough, to, marry, bella, however, after, a, few, weeks, the, first, world, war, began, closing, the, russian, border, for, an, indefinite, period, a, year, later, he, married, bella, rosenfeld, and, they, had, their, first, child, ida, before, the, marriage, chagall, had, difficulty, convincing, bella, s, parents, that, he, would, be, a, suitable, husband, for, their, daughter, they, were, worried, about, her, marrying, a, painter, from, a, poor, family, and, wondered, how, he, would, support, her, becoming, a, successful, artist, now, became, a, goal, and, inspiration, according, to, lewis, he, euphoric, paintings, of, this, time, which, show, the, young, couple, floating, balloon, like, over, vitebsk, its, wooden, buildings, faceted, in, the, delaunay, manner, are, the, most, lighthearted, of, his, career, his, wedding, pictures, were, also, a, subject, he, would, return, to, in, later, years, as, he, thought, about, this, period, of, his, life, 75, in, 1915, chagall, began, exhibiting, his, work, in, moscow, first, exhibiting, his, works, at, a, well, known, salon, and, in, 1916, exhibiting, pictures, in, st, petersburg, he, again, showed, his, art, at, a, moscow, exhibition, of, avant, garde, artists, this, exposure, brought, recognition, and, a, number, of, wealthy, collectors, began, buying, his, art, he, also, began, illustrating, a, number, of, yiddish, books, with, ink, drawings, he, illustrated, i, l, peretz, s, the, magician, in, 1917, chagall, was, 30, years, old, and, had, begun, to, become, well, known, 77, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, was, a, dangerous, time, for, chagall, although, it, also, offered, opportunity, chagall, wrote, he, came, to, fear, bolshevik, orders, pinned, on, fences, writing, the, factories, were, stopping, the, horizons, opened, space, and, emptiness, no, more, bread, the, black, lettering, on, the, morning, posters, made, me, feel, sick, at, heart, chagall, was, often, hungry, for, days, later, remembering, watching, a, bride, the, beggars, and, the, poor, wretches, weighted, down, with, bundles, leading, him, to, conclude, that, the, new, regime, had, turned, the, russian, empire, upside, down, the, way, i, turn, my, pictures, by, then, he, was, one, of, imperial, russia, s, most, distinguished, artists, and, a, member, of, the, modernist, avant, garde, which, enjoyed, special, privileges, and, prestige, as, the, aesthetic, arm, of, the, revolution, he, was, offered, a, notable, position, as, a, commissar, of, visual, arts, for, the, country, but, preferred, something, less, political, and, instead, accepted, a, job, as, commissar, of, arts, for, vitebsk, this, resulted, in, his, founding, the, vitebsk, arts, college, which, adds, lewis, became, the, most, distinguished, school, of, art, in, the, soviet, union, it, obtained, for, its, faculty, some, of, the, most, important, artists, in, the, country, such, as, el, lissitzky, and, kazimir, malevich, he, also, added, his, first, teacher, yehuda, pen, chagall, tried, to, create, an, atmosphere, of, a, collective, of, independently, minded, artists, each, with, their, own, unique, style, however, this, would, soon, prove, to, be, difficult, as, a, few, of, the, key, faculty, members, preferred, a, suprematist, art, of, squares, and, circles, and, disapproved, of, chagall, s, attempt, at, creating, bourgeois, individualism, chagall, then, resigned, as, commissar, and, moved, to, moscow, in, moscow, he, was, offered, a, job, as, stage, designer, for, the, newly, formed, state, jewish, chamber, theater, it, was, set, to, begin, operation, in, early, 1921, with, a, number, of, plays, by, sholem, aleichem, for, its, opening, he, created, a, number, of, large, background, murals, using, techniques, he, learned, from, bakst, his, early, teacher, one, of, the, main, murals, was, 9, feet, 2, 7, m, tall, by, 24, feet, 7, 3, m, long, and, included, images, of, various, lively, subjects, such, as, dancers, fiddlers, acrobats, and, farm, animals, one, critic, at, the, time, called, it, hebrew, jazz, in, paint, chagall, created, it, as, a, storehouse, of, symbols, and, devices, notes, lewis, the, murals, constituted, a, landmark, in, the, history, of, the, theatre, and, were, forerunners, of, his, later, large, scale, works, including, murals, for, the, new, york, metropolitan, opera, and, the, paris, opera, 87, the, first, world, war, ended, in, 1918, but, the, russian, civil, war, continued, and, famine, spread, the, chagalls, found, it, necessary, to, move, to, a, smaller, less, expensive, town, near, moscow, although, chagall, now, had, to, commute, to, moscow, daily, using, crowded, trains, in, 1921, he, worked, as, an, art, teacher, along, with, his, friend, sculptor, isaac, itkind, in, a, jewish, boys, shelter, in, suburban, malakhovka, which, housed, young, refugees, orphaned, by, pogroms, 270, while, there, he, created, a, series, of, illustrations, for, the, yiddish, poetry, cycle, grief, written, by, david, hofstein, who, was, another, teacher, at, the, malakhovka, shelter, 273, after, spending, the, years, between, 1921, and, 1922, living, in, primitive, conditions, he, decided, to, go, back, to, france, so, that, he, could, develop, his, art, in, a, more, comfortable, country, numerous, other, artists, writers, and, musicians, were, also, planning, to, relocate, to, the, west, he, applied, for, an, exit, visa, and, while, waiting, for, its, uncertain, approval, wrote, his, autobiography, my, life, 121, in, 1923, chagall, left, moscow, to, return, to, france, on, his, way, he, stopped, in, berlin, to, recover, the, many, pictures, he, had, left, there, on, exhibit, ten, years, earlier, before, the, war, began, but, was, unable, to, find, or, recover, any, of, them, nonetheless, after, returning, to, paris, he, again, rediscovered, the, free, expansion, and, fulfillment, which, were, so, essential, to, him, writes, lewis, with, all, his, early, works, now, lost, he, began, trying, to, paint, from, his, memories, of, his, earliest, years, in, vitebsk, with, sketches, and, oil, paintings, he, formed, a, business, relationship, with, french, art, dealer, ambroise, vollard, this, inspired, him, to, begin, creating, etchings, for, a, series, of, illustrated, books, including, gogol, s, dead, souls, the, bible, and, the, la, fontaine, s, fables, these, illustrations, would, eventually, come, to, represent, his, finest, printmaking, efforts, in, 1924, he, travelled, to, brittany, and, painted, la, fen, tre, sur, l, le, de, br, hat, by, 1926, he, had, his, first, exhibition, in, the, united, states, at, the, reinhardt, gallery, of, new, york, which, included, about, 100, works, although, he, did, not, travel, to, the, opening, he, instead, stayed, in, france, painting, ceaselessly, notes, baal, teshuva, it, was, not, until, 1927, that, chagall, made, his, name, in, the, french, art, world, when, art, critic, and, historian, maurice, raynal, awarded, him, a, place, in, his, book, modern, french, painters, however, raynal, was, still, at, a, loss, to, accurately, describe, chagall, to, his, readers, chagall, interrogates, life, in, the, light, of, a, refined, anxious, childlike, sensibility, a, slightly, romantic, temperament, a, blend, of, sadness, and, gaiety, characteristic, of, a, grave, view, of, life, his, imagination, his, temperament, no, doubt, forbid, a, latin, severity, of, composition, 314, during, this, period, he, traveled, throughout, france, and, the, c, te, d, azur, where, he, enjoyed, the, landscapes, colorful, vegetation, the, blue, mediterranean, sea, and, the, mild, weather, he, made, repeated, trips, to, the, countryside, taking, his, sketchbook, 9, he, also, visited, nearby, countries, and, later, wrote, about, the, impressions, some, of, those, travels, left, on, him, i, should, like, to, recall, how, advantageous, my, travels, outside, france, have, been, for, me, in, an, artistic, sense, in, holland, or, in, spain, italy, egypt, palestine, or, simply, in, the, south, of, france, there, in, the, south, for, the, first, time, in, my, life, i, saw, that, rich, greenness, the, like, of, which, i, had, never, seen, in, my, own, country, in, holland, i, thought, i, discovered, that, familiar, and, throbbing, light, like, the, light, between, the, late, afternoon, and, dusk, in, italy, i, found, that, peace, of, the, museums, which, the, sunlight, brought, to, life, in, spain, i, was, happy, to, find, the, inspiration, of, a, mystical, if, sometimes, cruel, past, to, find, the, song, of, its, sky, and, of, its, people, and, in, the, east, i, found, unexpectedly, the, bible, and, a, part, of, my, very, being, 77, after, returning, to, paris, from, one, of, his, trips, vollard, commissioned, chagall, to, illustrate, the, old, testament, although, he, could, have, completed, the, project, in, france, he, used, the, assignment, as, an, excuse, to, travel, to, mandatory, palestine, to, experience, for, himself, the, holy, land, in, 1931, marc, chagall, and, his, family, traveled, to, tel, aviv, on, the, invitation, of, meir, dizengoff, dizengoff, had, previously, encouraged, chagall, to, visit, tel, aviv, in, connection, with, dizengoff, s, plan, to, build, a, jewish, art, museum, in, the, new, city, chagall, and, his, family, were, invited, to, stay, at, dizengoff, s, house, in, tel, aviv, which, later, became, independence, hall, of, the, state, of, israel, chagall, ended, up, staying, in, the, holy, land, for, two, months, chagall, felt, at, home, in, israel, where, many, people, spoke, yiddish, and, russian, according, to, jacob, baal, teshuva, he, was, impressed, by, the, pioneering, spirit, of, the, people, in, the, kibbutzim, and, deeply, moved, by, the, wailing, wall, and, the, other, holy, places, 133, chagall, later, told, a, friend, that, israel, gave, him, the, most, vivid, impression, he, had, ever, received, wullschlager, notes, however, that, whereas, delacroix, and, matisse, had, found, inspiration, in, the, exoticism, of, north, africa, he, as, a, jew, in, israel, had, different, perspective, what, he, was, really, searching, for, there, was, not, external, stimulus, but, an, inner, authorization, from, the, land, of, his, ancestors, to, plunge, into, his, work, on, the, bible, illustrations, 343, chagall, stated, that, in, the, east, i, found, the, bible, and, part, of, my, own, being, as, a, result, he, immersed, himself, in, the, history, of, the, jews, their, trials, prophecies, and, disasters, notes, wullschlager, she, adds, that, beginning, the, assignment, was, an, extraordinary, risk, for, chagall, as, he, had, finally, become, well, known, as, a, leading, contemporary, painter, but, would, now, end, his, modernist, themes, and, delve, into, an, ancient, past, 350, between, 1931, and, 1934, he, worked, obsessively, on, the, bible, even, going, to, amsterdam, in, order, to, carefully, study, the, biblical, paintings, of, rembrandt, and, el, greco, to, see, the, extremes, of, religious, painting, he, walked, the, streets, of, the, city, s, jewish, quarter, to, again, feel, the, earlier, atmosphere, he, told, franz, meyer, i, did, not, see, the, bible, i, dreamed, it, ever, since, early, childhood, i, have, been, captivated, by, the, bible, it, has, always, seemed, to, me, and, still, seems, today, the, greatest, source, of, poetry, of, all, time, 350, chagall, saw, the, old, testament, as, a, human, story, not, with, the, creation, of, the, cosmos, but, with, the, creation, of, man, and, his, figures, of, angels, are, rhymed, or, combined, with, human, ones, writes, wullschlager, she, points, out, that, in, one, of, his, early, bible, images, abraham, and, the, three, angels, the, angels, sit, and, chat, over, a, glass, of, wine, as, if, they, have, just, dropped, by, for, dinner, 350, he, returned, to, france, and, by, the, next, year, had, completed, 32, out, of, the, total, of, 105, plates, by, 1939, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, he, had, finished, 66, however, vollard, died, that, same, year, when, the, series, was, completed, in, 1956, it, was, published, by, edition, t, riade, baal, teshuva, writes, that, the, illustrations, were, stunning, and, met, with, great, acclaim, once, again, chagall, had, shown, himself, to, be, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, important, graphic, artists, 135, leymarie, has, described, these, drawings, by, chagall, as, monumental, and, full, of, divine, inspiration, which, retrace, the, legendary, destiny, and, the, epic, history, of, israel, to, genesis, to, the, prophets, through, the, patriarchs, and, the, heroes, each, picture, becomes, one, with, the, event, informing, the, text, with, a, solemn, intimacy, unknown, since, rembrandt, ix, not, long, after, chagall, began, his, work, on, the, bible, adolf, hitler, gained, power, in, germany, anti, semitic, laws, were, being, introduced, and, the, first, concentration, camp, at, dachau, had, been, established, wullschlager, describes, the, early, effects, on, art, the, nazis, had, begun, their, campaign, against, modernist, art, as, soon, as, they, seized, power, expressionist, cubist, abstract, and, surrealist, art, anything, intellectual, jewish, foreign, socialist, inspired, or, difficult, to, understand, was, targeted, from, picasso, and, matisse, going, back, to, c, zanne, and, van, gogh, in, its, place, traditional, german, realism, accessible, and, open, to, patriotic, interpretation, was, extolled, 374, beginning, during, 1937, about, twenty, thousand, works, from, german, museums, were, confiscated, as, degenerate, by, a, committee, directed, by, joseph, goebbels, 375, although, the, german, press, had, once, swooned, over, him, the, new, german, authorities, now, made, a, mockery, of, chagall, s, art, describing, them, as, green, purple, and, red, jews, shooting, out, of, the, earth, fiddling, on, violins, flying, through, the, air, representing, assault, on, western, civilization, 376, after, germany, invaded, and, occupied, france, the, chagalls, remained, in, vichy, france, unaware, that, french, jews, with, the, help, of, the, vichy, government, were, being, collected, and, sent, to, german, concentration, camps, from, which, few, would, return, the, vichy, collaborationist, government, directed, by, marshal, philippe, p, tain, immediately, upon, assuming, power, established, a, commission, to, redefine, french, citizenship, with, the, aim, of, stripping, undesirables, including, naturalized, citizens, of, their, french, nationality, chagall, had, been, so, involved, with, his, art, that, it, was, not, until, october, 1940, after, the, vichy, government, at, the, behest, of, the, nazi, occupying, forces, began, approving, anti, semitic, laws, that, he, began, to, understand, what, was, happening, learning, that, jews, were, being, removed, from, public, and, academic, positions, the, chagalls, finally, woke, up, to, the, danger, they, faced, but, wullschlager, notes, that, by, then, they, were, trapped, 382, their, only, refuge, could, be, the, us, but, they, could, not, afford, the, passage, to, new, york, or, the, large, bond, that, each, immigrant, had, to, provide, upon, entry, to, ensure, that, they, would, not, become, a, financial, burden, to, the, country, according, to, wullschlager, he, speed, with, which, france, collapsed, astonished, everyone, the, capitulated, even, more, quickly, than, poland, had, done, a, year, earlier, shock, waves, crossed, the, atlantic, as, paris, had, until, then, been, equated, with, civilization, throughout, the, non, nazi, world, 388, yet, the, attachment, of, the, chagalls, to, france, blinded, them, to, the, urgency, of, the, situation, 389, many, other, well, known, russian, and, jewish, artists, eventually, sought, to, escape, these, included, cha, m, soutine, max, ernst, max, beckmann, ludwig, fulda, author, victor, serge, and, prize, winning, author, vladimir, nabokov, who, although, not, jewish, himself, was, married, to, a, jewish, woman, 1181, russian, author, victor, serge, described, many, of, the, people, living, temporarily, in, marseille, who, were, waiting, to, emigrate, to, the, us, here, is, a, beggar, s, alley, gathering, the, remnants, of, revolutions, democracies, and, crushed, intellects, in, our, ranks, are, enough, doctors, psychologists, engineers, educationalists, poets, painters, writers, musicians, economists, and, public, men, to, vitalize, a, whole, great, country, 392, after, prodding, by, their, daughter, ida, who, perceived, the, need, to, act, fast, 388, and, with, help, from, alfred, barr, of, the, new, york, museum, of, modern, art, chagall, was, saved, by, having, his, name, added, to, the, list, of, prominent, artists, whose, lives, were, at, risk, and, who, the, united, states, should, try, to, extricate, varian, fry, the, us, journalist, and, hiram, bingham, iv, the, us, vice, consul, in, marseilles, ran, a, rescue, operation, to, smuggle, artists, and, intellectuals, out, of, europe, to, the, us, by, providing, them, with, forged, visas, to, the, us, in, april, 1941, chagall, and, his, wife, were, stripped, of, their, french, citizenship, the, chagalls, stayed, at, the, hotel, moderne, in, marseille, where, they, were, arrested, along, with, other, jews, varian, fry, managed, to, pressure, the, french, police, to, release, him, threatening, them, of, scandal, chagall, was, one, of, over, 2, 000, who, were, rescued, by, this, operation, he, left, france, in, may, 1941, when, it, was, almost, too, late, adds, lewis, picasso, and, matisse, were, also, invited, to, come, to, the, us, but, they, decided, to, remain, in, france, on, 10, june, 1941, chagall, and, bella, left, lisbon, aboard, the, portuguese, ship, mouzinho, the, passengers, included, 119, refugee, children, to, whom, chagall, gave, drawing, lessons, on, the, voyage, the, ship, reached, staten, island, on, 21, june, the, day, before, germany, invaded, the, soviet, union, ida, and, her, husband, michel, followed, on, the, notorious, refugee, ship, navemar, with, a, large, case, of, chagall, s, work, a, chance, post, war, meeting, in, a, french, caf, between, ida, and, intelligence, analyst, konrad, kellen, led, to, kellen, carrying, more, paintings, on, his, return, to, the, united, states, even, before, arriving, in, the, united, states, in, 1941, chagall, was, awarded, the, carnegie, prize, third, prize, in, 1939, for, les, fianc, s, after, being, in, the, us, he, discovered, that, he, had, already, achieved, international, stature, writes, cogniat, although, he, felt, ill, suited, in, this, new, role, in, a, foreign, country, whose, language, he, could, not, yet, speak, he, became, a, celebrity, mostly, against, his, will, feeling, lost, in, the, strange, surroundings, 57, after, a, while, he, began, to, settle, in, new, york, which, was, full, of, writers, painters, and, composers, who, like, himself, had, fled, from, europe, during, the, nazi, invasions, he, lived, at, 4, east, 74th, street, he, spent, time, visiting, galleries, and, museums, and, befriended, other, artists, including, piet, mondrian, and, andr, breton, 155, baal, teshuva, writes, that, chagall, loved, going, to, the, sections, of, new, york, where, jews, lived, especially, the, lower, east, side, there, he, felt, at, home, enjoying, the, jewish, foods, and, being, able, to, read, the, yiddish, press, which, became, his, main, source, of, information, since, he, did, not, yet, speak, english, contemporary, artists, did, not, yet, understand, or, even, like, chagall, s, art, according, to, baal, teshuva, they, had, little, in, common, with, a, folkloristic, storyteller, of, russo, jewish, extraction, with, a, propensity, for, mysticism, the, paris, school, which, was, referred, to, as, parisian, surrealism, meant, little, to, them, 155, those, attitudes, would, begin, to, change, however, when, pierre, matisse, the, son, of, recognized, french, artist, henri, matisse, became, his, representative, and, managed, chagall, exhibitions, in, new, york, and, chicago, in, 1941, one, of, the, earliest, exhibitions, included, 21, of, his, masterpieces, from, 1910, to, 1941, art, critic, henry, mcbride, wrote, about, this, exhibit, for, the, new, york, sun, chagall, is, about, as, gypsy, as, they, come, these, pictures, do, more, for, his, reputation, than, anything, we, have, previously, seen, his, colors, sparkle, with, poetry, his, work, is, authentically, russian, as, a, volga, boatman, s, song, he, was, offered, a, commission, by, choreographer, l, onide, massine, of, the, ballet, theatre, of, new, york, to, design, the, sets, and, costumes, for, his, new, ballet, aleko, this, ballet, would, stage, the, words, of, alexander, pushkin, s, verse, narrative, the, gypsies, with, the, music, of, tchaikovsky, the, ballet, was, originally, planned, for, a, new, york, debut, but, as, a, cost, saving, measure, it, was, moved, to, mexico, where, labor, costs, were, cheaper, than, in, new, york, while, chagall, had, done, stage, settings, before, while, in, russia, this, was, his, first, ballet, and, it, would, give, him, the, opportunity, to, visit, mexico, while, there, he, quickly, began, to, appreciate, the, primitive, ways, and, colorful, art, of, the, mexicans, notes, cogniat, he, found, something, very, closely, related, to, his, own, nature, and, did, all, the, color, detail, for, the, sets, while, there, eventually, he, created, four, large, backdrops, and, had, mexican, seamstresses, sew, the, ballet, costumes, when, the, ballet, premiered, at, the, palacio, de, bellas, artes, in, mexico, city, on, 8, september, 1942, it, was, considered, a, remarkable, success, in, the, audience, were, other, famous, mural, painters, who, came, to, see, chagall, s, work, including, diego, rivera, and, jos, clemente, orozco, according, to, baal, teshuva, when, the, final, bar, of, music, ended, there, was, a, tumultuous, applause, and, 19, curtain, calls, with, chagall, himself, being, called, back, onto, the, stage, again, and, again, the, production, then, moved, to, new, york, where, it, was, presented, four, weeks, later, at, the, metropolitan, opera, and, the, response, was, repeated, again, chagall, was, the, hero, of, the, evening, 158, art, critic, edwin, denby, wrote, of, the, opening, for, the, new, york, herald, tribune, that, chagall, s, work, has, turned, into, a, dramatized, exhibition, of, giant, paintings, it, surpasses, anything, chagall, has, done, on, the, easel, scale, and, it, is, a, breathtaking, experience, of, a, kind, one, hardly, expects, in, the, theatre, after, chagall, returned, to, new, york, in, 1943, current, events, began, to, interest, him, more, and, this, was, represented, by, his, art, where, he, painted, subjects, including, the, crucifixion, and, scenes, of, war, he, learned, that, the, germans, had, destroyed, the, town, where, he, was, raised, vitebsk, and, became, greatly, distressed, 159, he, also, learned, about, the, nazi, concentration, camps, during, a, speech, in, february, 1944, he, described, some, of, his, feelings, meanwhile, the, enemy, jokes, saying, that, we, are, a, stupid, nation, he, thought, that, when, he, started, slaughtering, the, jews, we, would, all, in, our, grief, suddenly, raise, the, greatest, prophetic, scream, and, would, be, joined, by, the, christian, humanists, but, after, two, thousand, years, of, christianity, in, the, world, say, whatever, you, like, but, with, few, exceptions, their, hearts, are, silent, i, see, the, artists, in, christian, nations, sit, still, who, has, heard, them, speak, up, they, are, not, worried, about, themselves, and, our, jewish, life, doesn, t, concern, them, 89, in, the, same, speech, he, credited, soviet, russia, with, doing, the, most, to, save, the, jews, the, jews, will, always, be, grateful, to, it, what, other, great, country, has, saved, a, million, and, a, half, jews, from, hitler, s, hands, and, shared, its, last, piece, of, bread, what, country, abolished, antisemitism, what, other, country, devoted, at, least, a, piece, of, land, as, an, autonomous, region, for, jews, who, want, to, live, there, all, this, and, more, weighs, heavily, on, the, scales, of, history, 89, on, 2, september, 1944, bella, died, suddenly, due, to, a, streptococcus, infection, which, could, not, be, treated, at, the, mercy, general, hospital, as, they, had, no, penicillin, due, to, wartime, restrictions, as, a, result, he, stopped, all, work, for, many, months, and, when, he, did, resume, painting, his, first, pictures, were, concerned, with, preserving, bella, s, memory, wullschlager, writes, of, the, effect, on, chagall, as, news, poured, in, through, 1945, of, the, ongoing, holocaust, at, nazi, concentration, camps, bella, took, her, place, in, chagall, s, mind, with, the, millions, of, jewish, victims, he, even, considered, the, possibility, that, their, exile, from, europe, had, sapped, her, will, to, live, 419, after, a, year, of, living, with, his, daughter, ida, and, her, husband, michel, gordey, he, entered, into, a, romance, with, virginia, haggard, daughter, of, diplomat, godfrey, haggard, and, great, niece, of, the, author, h, rider, haggard, their, relationship, endured, seven, years, they, had, a, child, together, david, mcneil, born, 22, june, 1946, haggard, recalled, her, seven, years, of, plenty, with, chagall, in, her, book, my, life, with, chagall, robert, hale, 1986, a, few, months, after, the, allies, succeeded, in, liberating, paris, from, nazi, occupation, with, the, help, of, the, allied, armies, chagall, published, a, letter, in, a, paris, weekly, to, the, paris, artists, in, recent, years, i, have, felt, unhappy, that, i, couldn, t, be, with, you, my, friends, my, enemy, forced, me, to, take, the, road, of, exile, on, that, tragic, road, i, lost, my, wife, the, companion, of, my, life, the, woman, who, was, my, inspiration, i, want, to, say, to, my, friends, in, france, that, she, joins, me, in, this, greeting, she, who, loved, france, and, french, art, so, faithfully, her, last, joy, was, the, liberation, of, paris, now, when, paris, is, liberated, when, the, art, of, france, is, resurrected, the, whole, world, too, will, once, and, for, all, be, free, of, the, satanic, enemies, who, wanted, to, annihilate, not, just, the, body, but, also, the, soul, the, soul, without, which, there, is, no, life, no, artistic, creativity, 101, by, 1946, his, artwork, was, becoming, more, widely, recognized, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, had, a, large, exhibition, representing, 40, years, of, his, work, which, gave, visitors, one, of, the, first, complete, impressions, of, the, changing, nature, of, his, art, over, the, years, the, war, had, ended, and, he, began, making, plans, to, return, to, paris, according, to, cogniat, he, found, he, was, even, more, deeply, attached, than, before, not, only, to, the, atmosphere, of, paris, but, to, the, city, itself, to, its, houses, and, its, views, chagall, summed, up, his, years, living, in, the, us, i, lived, here, in, america, during, the, inhuman, war, in, which, humanity, deserted, itself, i, have, seen, the, rhythm, of, life, i, have, seen, america, fighting, with, allies, the, wealth, that, she, has, distributed, to, bring, relief, to, the, people, who, had, to, suffer, the, consequences, of, the, war, i, like, america, and, the, americans, people, there, are, frank, it, is, a, young, country, with, the, qualities, and, faults, of, youth, it, is, a, delight, to, love, people, like, that, above, all, i, am, impressed, by, the, greatness, of, this, country, and, the, freedom, that, it, gives, 170, he, went, back, to, france, for, good, during, the, autumn, of, 1947, where, he, attended, the, opening, of, the, exhibition, of, his, works, at, the, mus, e, national, d, art, moderne, after, returning, to, france, he, traveled, throughout, europe, and, chose, to, live, in, the, c, te, d, azur, which, by, that, time, had, become, somewhat, of, an, artistic, centre, matisse, lived, near, saint, paul, de, vence, about, seven, miles, west, of, nice, while, picasso, lived, in, vallauris, although, they, lived, nearby, and, sometimes, worked, together, there, was, artistic, rivalry, between, them, as, their, work, was, so, distinctly, different, and, they, never, became, long, term, friends, according, to, picasso, s, mistress, fran, oise, gilot, picasso, still, had, a, great, deal, of, respect, for, chagall, and, once, told, her, when, matisse, dies, chagall, will, be, the, only, painter, left, who, understands, what, color, is, his, canvases, are, really, painted, not, just, tossed, together, some, of, the, last, things, he, s, done, in, vence, convince, me, that, there, s, never, been, anybody, since, renoir, who, has, the, feeling, for, light, that, chagall, has, in, april, 1952, virginia, haggard, left, chagall, for, the, photographer, charles, leirens, she, went, on, to, become, a, professional, photographer, herself, chagall, s, daughter, ida, married, art, historian, franz, meyer, in, january, 1952, and, feeling, that, her, father, missed, the, companionship, of, a, woman, in, his, home, introduced, him, to, valentina, vava, brodsky, a, woman, from, a, similar, russian, jewish, background, who, had, run, a, successful, millinery, business, in, london, she, became, his, secretary, and, after, a, few, months, agreed, to, stay, only, if, chagall, married, her, the, marriage, took, place, in, july, 1952, 183, though, six, years, later, when, there, was, conflict, between, ida, and, vava, marc, and, vava, divorced, and, immediately, remarried, under, an, agreement, more, favourable, to, vava, jean, paul, crespelle, author, of, chagall, l, amour, le, reve, et, la, vie, quoted, in, haggard, my, life, with, chagall, in, 1954, he, was, engaged, as, set, decorator, for, robert, helpmann, s, production, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, opera, le, coq, d, or, at, the, royal, opera, house, covent, garden, but, he, withdrew, the, australian, designer, loudon, sainthill, was, drafted, at, short, notice, in, his, place, in, the, years, ahead, he, was, able, to, produce, not, just, paintings, and, graphic, art, but, also, numerous, sculptures, and, ceramics, including, wall, tiles, painted, vases, plates, and, jugs, he, also, began, working, in, larger, scale, formats, producing, large, murals, stained, glass, windows, mosaics, and, tapestries, in, 1963, chagall, was, commissioned, to, paint, the, new, ceiling, for, the, paris, opera, palais, garnier, a, majestic, 19th, century, building, and, national, monument, andr, malraux, france, s, minister, of, culture, wanted, something, unique, and, decided, chagall, would, be, the, ideal, artist, however, this, choice, of, artist, caused, controversy, some, objected, to, having, a, russian, jew, decorate, a, french, national, monument, others, disliked, the, ceiling, of, the, historic, building, being, painted, by, a, modern, artist, some, magazines, wrote, condescending, articles, about, chagall, and, malraux, about, which, chagall, commented, to, one, writer, they, really, had, it, in, for, me, it, is, amazing, the, way, the, french, resent, foreigners, you, live, here, most, of, your, life, you, become, a, naturalized, french, citizen, work, for, nothing, decorating, their, cathedrals, and, still, they, despise, you, you, are, not, one, of, them, 196, nonetheless, chagall, continued, the, project, which, took, the, 77, year, old, artist, a, year, to, complete, the, final, canvas, was, nearly, 2, 400, square, feet, 220, sq, meters, and, required, 440, pounds, 200, kg, of, paint, it, had, five, sections, which, were, glued, to, polyester, panels, and, hoisted, up, to, the, 70, foot, 21, m, ceiling, the, images, chagall, painted, on, the, canvas, paid, tribute, to, the, composers, mozart, wagner, mussorgsky, berlioz, and, ravel, as, well, as, to, famous, actors, and, dancers, 199, it, was, presented, to, the, public, on, 23, september, 1964, in, the, presence, of, malraux, and, 2, 100, invited, guests, the, paris, correspondent, for, the, new, york, times, wrote, for, once, the, best, seats, were, in, the, uppermost, circle, 199, baal, teshuva, writes, to, begin, with, the, big, crystal, chandelier, hanging, from, the, centre, of, the, ceiling, was, unlit, the, entire, corps, de, ballet, came, onto, the, stage, after, which, in, chagall, s, honour, the, opera, s, orchestra, played, the, finale, of, the, jupiter, symphony, by, mozart, chagall, s, favorite, composer, during, the, last, bars, of, the, music, the, chandelier, lit, up, bringing, the, artist, s, ceiling, painting, to, life, in, all, its, glory, drawing, rapturous, applause, from, the, audience, 199, after, the, new, ceiling, was, unveiled, even, the, bitterest, opponents, of, the, commission, seemed, to, fall, silent, writes, baal, teshuva, unanimously, the, press, declared, chagall, s, new, work, to, be, a, great, contribution, to, french, culture, malraux, later, said, what, other, living, artist, could, have, painted, the, ceiling, of, the, paris, opera, in, the, way, chagall, did, he, is, above, all, one, of, the, great, colourists, of, our, time, many, of, his, canvases, and, the, opera, ceiling, represent, sublime, images, that, rank, among, the, finest, poetry, of, our, time, just, as, titian, produced, the, finest, poetry, of, his, day, 199, in, chagall, s, speech, to, the, audience, he, explained, the, meaning, of, the, work, up, there, in, my, painting, i, wanted, to, reflect, like, a, mirror, in, a, bouquet, the, dreams, and, creations, of, the, singers, and, musicians, to, recall, the, movement, of, the, colourfully, attired, audience, below, and, to, honour, the, great, opera, and, ballet, composers, now, i, offer, this, work, as, a, gift, of, gratitude, to, france, and, her, cole, de, paris, without, which, there, would, be, no, colour, and, no, freedom, 151, according, to, cogniat, in, all, chagall, s, work, during, all, stages, of, his, life, it, was, his, colors, which, attracted, and, captured, the, viewer, s, attention, during, his, earlier, years, his, range, was, limited, by, his, emphasis, on, form, and, his, pictures, never, gave, the, impression, of, painted, drawings, he, adds, the, colors, are, a, living, integral, part, of, the, picture, and, are, never, passively, flat, or, banal, like, an, afterthought, they, sculpt, and, animate, the, volume, of, the, shapes, they, indulge, in, flights, of, fancy, and, invention, which, add, new, perspectives, and, graduated, blended, tones, his, colors, do, not, even, attempt, to, imitate, nature, but, rather, to, suggest, movements, planes, and, rhythms, he, was, able, to, convey, striking, images, using, only, two, or, three, colors, cogniat, writes, chagall, is, unrivalled, in, this, ability, to, give, a, vivid, impression, of, explosive, movement, with, the, simplest, use, of, colors, throughout, his, life, his, colors, created, a, vibrant, atmosphere, which, was, based, on, his, own, personal, vision, 60, chagall, s, early, life, left, him, with, a, powerful, visual, memory, and, a, pictorial, intelligence, writes, goodman, after, living, in, france, and, experiencing, the, atmosphere, of, artistic, freedom, his, vision, soared, and, he, created, a, new, reality, one, that, drew, on, both, his, inner, and, outer, worlds, but, it, was, the, images, and, memories, of, his, early, years, in, belarus, that, would, sustain, his, art, for, more, than, 70, years, 13, according, to, cogniat, there, are, certain, elements, in, his, art, that, have, remained, permanent, and, seen, throughout, his, career, one, of, those, was, his, choice, of, subjects, and, the, way, they, were, portrayed, the, most, obviously, constant, element, is, his, gift, for, happiness, and, his, instinctive, compassion, which, even, in, the, most, serious, subjects, prevents, him, from, dramatization, 89, musicians, have, been, a, constant, during, all, stages, of, his, work, after, he, first, got, married, lovers, have, sought, each, other, embraced, caressed, floated, through, the, air, met, in, wreaths, of, flowers, stretched, and, swooped, like, the, melodious, passage, of, their, vivid, day, dreams, acrobats, contort, themselves, with, the, grace, of, exotic, flowers, on, the, end, of, their, stems, flowers, and, foliage, abound, everywhere, wullschlager, explains, the, sources, for, these, images, for, him, clowns, and, acrobats, always, resembled, figures, in, religious, paintings, the, evolution, of, the, circus, works, reflects, a, gradual, clouding, of, his, worldview, and, the, circus, performers, now, gave, way, to, the, prophet, or, sage, in, his, work, a, figure, into, whom, chagall, poured, his, anxiety, as, europe, darkened, and, he, could, no, longer, rely, on, the, lumi, re, libert, of, france, for, inspiration, 337, chagall, described, his, love, of, circus, people, why, am, i, so, touched, by, their, makeup, and, grimaces, with, them, i, can, move, toward, new, horizons, chaplin, seeks, to, do, in, film, what, i, am, trying, to, do, in, my, paintings, he, is, perhaps, the, only, artist, today, i, could, get, along, with, without, having, to, say, a, single, word, 337, his, early, pictures, were, often, of, the, town, where, he, was, born, and, raised, vitebsk, cogniat, notes, that, they, are, realistic, and, give, the, impression, of, firsthand, experience, by, capturing, a, moment, in, time, with, action, often, with, a, dramatic, image, during, his, later, years, as, for, instance, in, the, bible, series, subjects, were, more, dramatic, he, managed, to, blend, the, real, with, the, fantastic, and, combined, with, his, use, of, color, the, pictures, were, always, at, least, acceptable, if, not, powerful, he, never, attempted, to, present, pure, reality, but, always, created, his, atmospheres, through, fantasy, 91, in, all, cases, chagall, s, most, persistent, subject, is, life, itself, in, its, simplicity, or, its, hidden, complexity, he, presents, for, our, study, places, people, and, objects, from, his, own, life, after, absorbing, the, techniques, of, fauvism, and, cubism, under, the, influence, of, jean, metzinger, and, albert, gleizes, chagall, was, able, to, blend, these, stylistic, tendencies, with, his, own, folkish, style, he, gave, the, grim, life, of, hasidic, jews, the, romantic, overtones, of, a, charmed, world, notes, goodman, it, was, by, combining, the, aspects, of, modernism, with, his, unique, artistic, language, that, he, was, able, to, catch, the, attention, of, critics, and, collectors, throughout, europe, generally, it, was, his, boyhood, of, living, in, a, belarusian, provincial, town, that, gave, him, a, continual, source, of, imaginative, stimuli, chagall, would, become, one, of, many, jewish, migr, s, who, later, became, noted, artists, all, of, them, similarly, having, once, been, part, of, russia, s, most, numerous, and, creative, minorities, notes, goodman, 13, world, war, i, which, ended, in, 1918, had, displaced, nearly, a, million, jews, and, destroyed, most, of, what, remained, of, the, provincial, shtetl, culture, that, had, defined, life, for, most, eastern, european, jews, for, centuries, goodman, notes, the, fading, of, traditional, jewish, society, left, artists, like, chagall, with, powerful, memories, that, could, no, longer, be, fed, by, a, tangible, reality, instead, that, culture, became, an, emotional, and, intellectual, source, that, existed, solely, in, memory, and, the, imagination, so, rich, had, the, experience, been, it, sustained, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, 15, sweeney, adds, that, if, you, ask, chagall, to, explain, his, paintings, he, would, reply, i, don, t, understand, them, at, all, they, are, not, literature, they, are, only, pictorial, arrangements, of, images, that, obsess, me, 7, in, 1948, after, returning, to, france, from, the, u, s, after, the, war, he, saw, for, himself, the, destruction, that, the, war, had, brought, to, europe, and, the, jewish, populations, in, 1951, as, part, of, a, memorial, book, dedicated, to, eighty, four, jewish, artists, who, were, killed, by, the, nazis, in, france, he, wrote, a, poem, entitled, for, the, slaughtered, artists, 1950, which, inspired, paintings, such, as, the, song, of, david, see, photo, i, see, the, fire, the, smoke, and, the, gas, rising, to, the, blue, cloud, turning, it, black, i, see, the, torn, out, hair, the, pulled, out, teeth, they, overwhelm, me, with, my, rabid, palette, i, stand, in, the, desert, before, heaps, of, boots, clothing, ash, and, dung, and, mumble, my, kaddish, and, as, i, stand, from, my, paintings, the, painted, david, descends, to, me, harp, in, hand, he, wants, to, help, me, weep, and, recite, chapters, of, psalms, 114, 115, lewis, writes, that, chagall, remains, the, most, important, visual, artist, to, have, borne, witness, to, the, world, of, east, european, jewry, and, inadvertently, became, the, public, witness, of, a, now, vanished, civilization, although, judaism, has, religious, inhibitions, about, pictorial, art, of, many, religious, subjects, chagall, managed, to, use, his, fantasy, images, as, a, form, of, visual, metaphor, combined, with, folk, imagery, his, fiddler, on, the, roof, for, example, combines, a, folksy, village, setting, with, a, fiddler, as, a, way, to, show, the, jewish, love, of, music, as, important, to, the, jewish, spirit, music, played, an, important, role, in, shaping, the, subjects, of, his, work, while, he, later, came, to, love, the, music, of, bach, and, mozart, during, his, youth, he, was, mostly, influenced, by, the, music, within, the, hasidic, community, where, he, was, raised, art, historian, franz, meyer, points, out, that, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, unconventional, nature, of, his, work, is, related, to, the, hassidism, which, inspired, the, world, of, his, childhood, and, youth, and, had, actually, impressed, itself, on, most, eastern, european, jews, since, the, 18th, century, he, writes, for, chagall, this, is, one, of, the, deepest, sources, not, of, inspiration, but, of, a, certain, spiritual, attitude, the, hassidic, spirit, is, still, the, basis, and, source, of, nourishment, of, his, art, 24, in, a, talk, that, chagall, gave, in, 1963, while, visiting, the, us, he, discussed, some, of, those, impressions, however, chagall, had, a, complex, relationship, with, judaism, on, the, one, hand, he, credited, his, russian, jewish, cultural, background, as, being, crucial, to, his, artistic, imagination, but, however, ambivalent, he, was, about, his, religion, he, could, not, avoid, drawing, upon, his, jewish, past, for, artistic, material, as, an, adult, he, was, not, a, practicing, jew, but, through, his, paintings, and, stained, glass, he, continually, tried, to, suggest, a, more, universal, message, using, both, jewish, and, christian, themes, for, about, two, thousand, years, a, reserve, of, energy, has, fed, and, supported, us, and, filled, our, lives, but, during, the, last, century, a, split, has, opened, in, this, reserve, and, its, components, have, begun, to, disintegrate, god, perspective, colour, the, bible, shape, line, traditions, the, so, called, humanities, love, devotion, family, school, education, the, prophets, and, christ, himself, have, i, too, perhaps, doubted, in, my, time, i, painted, pictures, upside, down, decapitated, people, and, dissected, them, scattering, the, pieces, in, the, air, all, in, the, name, of, another, perspective, another, kind, of, picture, composition, and, another, formalism, 29, he, was, also, at, pains, to, distance, his, work, from, a, single, jewish, focus, at, the, opening, of, the, chagall, museum, in, nice, he, said, my, painting, represents, not, the, dream, of, one, people, but, of, all, humanity, one, of, chagall, s, major, contributions, to, art, has, been, his, work, with, stained, glass, this, medium, allowed, him, further, to, express, his, desire, to, create, intense, and, fresh, colors, and, had, the, added, benefit, of, natural, light, and, refraction, interacting, and, constantly, changing, everything, from, the, position, where, the, viewer, stood, to, the, weather, outside, would, alter, the, visual, effect, though, this, is, not, the, case, with, his, hadassah, windows, it, was, not, until, 1956, when, he, was, nearly, 70, years, of, age, that, he, designed, windows, for, the, glise, notre, dame, de, toute, gr, ce, du, plateau, d, assy, his, first, major, project, then, from, 1958, to, 1960, he, created, windows, for, metz, cathedral, in, 1960, he, began, creating, stained, glass, windows, for, the, synagogue, of, hebrew, university, s, hadassah, medical, center, in, jerusalem, leymarie, writes, that, in, order, to, illuminate, the, synagogue, both, spiritually, and, physically, it, was, decided, that, the, twelve, windows, representing, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, were, to, be, filled, with, stained, glass, chagall, envisaged, the, synagogue, as, a, crown, offered, to, the, jewish, queen, and, the, windows, as, jewels, of, translucent, fire, she, writes, chagall, then, devoted, the, next, two, years, to, the, task, and, upon, completion, in, 1961, the, windows, were, exhibited, in, paris, and, then, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, they, were, installed, permanently, in, jerusalem, in, february, 1962, each, of, the, twelve, windows, is, approximately, 11, feet, high, and, 8, feet, 2, 4, m, wide, much, larger, than, anything, he, had, done, before, cogniat, considers, them, to, be, his, greatest, work, in, the, field, of, stained, glass, although, virginia, haggard, mcneil, records, chagall, s, disappointment, that, they, were, to, be, lit, with, artificial, light, and, so, would, not, change, according, to, the, conditions, of, natural, light, french, philosopher, gaston, bachelard, commented, that, chagall, reads, the, bible, and, suddenly, the, passages, become, light, xii, in, 1973, israel, released, a, 12, stamp, set, with, images, of, the, stained, glass, windows, the, windows, symbolize, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, who, were, blessed, by, jacob, and, moses, in, the, verses, which, conclude, genesis, and, deuteronomy, in, those, books, notes, leymarie, the, dying, moses, repeated, jacob, s, solemn, act, and, in, a, somewhat, different, order, also, blessed, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, who, were, about, to, enter, the, land, of, canaan, in, the, synagogue, where, the, windows, are, distributed, in, the, same, way, the, tribes, form, a, symbolic, guard, of, honor, around, the, tabernacle, xii, leymarie, describes, the, physical, and, spiritual, significance, of, the, windows, the, essence, of, the, jerusalem, windows, lies, in, color, in, chagall, s, magical, ability, to, animate, material, and, transform, it, into, light, words, do, not, have, the, power, to, describe, chagall, s, color, its, spirituality, its, singing, quality, its, dazzling, luminosity, its, ever, more, subtle, flow, and, its, sensitivity, to, the, inflections, of, the, soul, and, the, transports, of, the, imagination, it, is, simultaneously, jewel, hard, and, foamy, reverberating, and, penetrating, radiating, light, from, an, unknown, interior, xii, at, the, dedication, ceremony, in, 1962, chagall, described, his, feelings, about, the, windows, for, me, a, stained, glass, window, is, a, transparent, partition, between, my, heart, and, the, heart, of, the, world, stained, glass, has, to, be, serious, and, passionate, it, is, something, elevating, and, exhilarating, it, has, to, live, through, the, perception, of, light, to, read, the, bible, is, to, perceive, a, certain, light, and, the, window, has, to, make, this, obvious, through, its, simplicity, and, grace, the, thoughts, have, nested, in, me, for, many, years, since, the, time, when, my, feet, walked, on, the, holy, land, when, i, prepared, myself, to, create, engravings, of, the, bible, they, strengthened, me, and, encouraged, me, to, bring, my, modest, gift, to, the, jewish, people, that, people, that, lived, here, thousands, of, years, ago, among, the, other, semitic, peoples, 145, 146, in, 1964, chagall, created, a, stained, glass, window, entitled, peace, for, the, un, in, honor, of, dag, hammarskj, ld, the, un, s, second, secretary, general, who, was, killed, in, an, airplane, crash, in, northern, rhodesia, in, 1961, the, window, is, about, 15, feet, 4, 6, m, wide, and, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, high, and, contains, symbols, of, peace, and, love, along, with, musical, symbols, in, 1967, he, dedicated, a, stained, glass, window, to, john, d, rockefeller, in, the, union, church, of, pocantico, hills, new, york, the, fraum, nster, church, in, zurich, switzerland, founded, in, 853, is, known, for, its, five, large, stained, glass, windows, created, by, chagall, in, 1967, each, window, is, 32, feet, 9, 8, m, tall, by, 3, feet, 0, 91, m, wide, religion, historian, james, h, charlesworth, notes, that, it, is, surprising, how, christian, symbols, are, featured, in, the, works, of, an, artist, who, comes, from, a, strict, and, orthodox, jewish, background, he, surmises, that, chagall, as, a, result, of, his, russian, background, often, used, russian, icons, in, his, paintings, with, their, interpretations, of, christian, symbols, he, explains, that, his, chosen, themes, were, usually, derived, from, biblical, stories, and, frequently, portrayed, the, obedience, and, suffering, of, god, s, chosen, people, one, of, the, panels, depicts, moses, receiving, the, torah, with, rays, of, light, from, his, head, at, the, top, of, another, panel, is, a, depiction, of, jesus, crucifixion, in, 1978, he, began, creating, windows, for, st, stephan, s, church, in, mainz, germany, today, 200, 000, visitors, a, year, visit, the, church, and, tourists, from, the, whole, world, pilgrim, up, st, stephan, s, mount, to, see, the, glowing, blue, stained, glass, windows, by, the, artist, marc, chagall, states, the, city, s, web, site, st, stephan, s, is, the, only, german, church, for, which, chagall, has, created, windows, the, website, also, notes, the, colours, address, our, vital, consciousness, directly, because, they, tell, of, optimism, hope, and, delight, in, life, says, monsignor, klaus, mayer, who, imparts, chagall, s, work, in, mediations, and, books, he, corresponded, with, chagall, during, 1973, and, succeeded, in, persuading, the, master, of, colour, and, the, biblical, message, to, create, a, sign, for, jewish, christian, attachment, and, international, understanding, centuries, earlier, mainz, had, been, the, capital, of, european, jewry, and, contained, the, largest, jewish, community, in, europe, notes, historian, john, man, 16, in, 1978, at, the, age, of, 91, chagall, created, the, first, window, and, eight, more, followed, chagall, s, collaborator, charles, marq, complemented, chagall, s, work, by, adding, several, stained, glass, windows, using, the, typical, colors, of, chagall, all, saints, church, tudeley, is, the, only, church, in, the, world, to, have, all, its, twelve, windows, decorated, by, chagall, the, other, three, religious, buildings, with, complete, sets, of, chagall, windows, are, the, hadassah, medical, center, synagogue, the, chapel, of, le, saillant, limousin, and, the, union, church, of, pocantico, hills, new, york, the, windows, at, tudeley, were, commissioned, by, sir, henry, and, lady, rosemary, d, avigdor, goldsmid, as, a, memorial, tribute, to, their, daughter, sarah, who, died, in, 1963, aged, 21, in, a, sailing, accident, off, rye, when, chagall, arrived, for, the, dedication, of, the, east, window, in, 1967, and, saw, the, church, for, the, first, time, he, exclaimed, c, est, magnifique, je, les, ferai, tous, it, s, beautiful, i, will, do, them, all, over, the, next, ten, years, chagall, designed, the, remaining, eleven, windows, made, again, in, collaboration, with, the, glassworker, charles, marq, in, his, workshop, at, reims, in, northern, france, the, last, windows, were, installed, in, 1985, just, before, chagall, s, death, on, the, north, side, of, chichester, cathedral, there, is, a, stained, glass, window, designed, and, created, by, chagall, at, the, age, of, 90, the, window, his, last, commissioned, work, was, inspired, by, psalm, 150, let, everything, that, hath, breath, praise, the, lord, at, the, suggestion, of, dean, walter, hussey, the, window, was, unveiled, by, the, duchess, of, kent, in, 1978, chagall, visited, chicago, in, the, early, 1970s, to, install, his, mural, the, four, seasons, and, at, that, time, was, inspired, to, create, a, set, of, stained, glass, windows, for, the, art, institute, of, chicago, after, discussions, with, the, art, institute, and, further, reflection, chagall, made, the, windows, a, tribute, to, the, american, bicentennial, and, in, particular, the, commitment, of, the, united, states, to, cultural, and, religious, freedom, the, windows, appeared, prominently, in, the, 1986, movie, ferris, bueller, s, day, off, from, 2005, to, 2010, the, windows, were, moved, due, to, nearby, construction, on, a, new, wing, of, the, art, institute, and, for, archival, cleaning, chagall, first, worked, on, stage, designs, in, 1914, while, living, in, russia, under, the, inspiration, of, the, theatrical, designer, and, artist, l, on, bakst, it, was, during, this, period, in, the, russian, theatre, that, formerly, static, ideas, of, stage, design, were, according, to, cogniat, being, swept, away, in, favor, of, a, wholly, arbitrary, sense, of, space, with, different, dimensions, perspectives, colors, and, rhythms, 66, these, changes, appealed, to, chagall, who, had, been, experimenting, with, cubism, and, wanted, a, way, to, enliven, his, images, designing, murals, and, stage, designs, chagall, s, dreams, sprang, to, life, and, became, an, actual, movement, as, a, result, chagall, played, an, important, role, in, russian, artistic, life, during, that, time, and, was, one, of, the, most, important, forces, in, the, current, urge, towards, anti, realism, which, helped, the, new, russia, invent, astonishing, creations, many, of, his, designs, were, done, for, the, jewish, theatre, in, moscow, which, put, on, numerous, jewish, plays, by, playwrights, such, as, gogol, and, singe, chagall, s, set, designs, helped, create, illusory, atmospheres, which, became, the, essence, of, the, theatrical, performances, after, leaving, russia, twenty, years, passed, before, he, was, again, offered, a, chance, to, design, theatre, sets, in, the, years, between, his, paintings, still, included, harlequins, clowns, and, acrobats, which, cogniat, notes, convey, his, sentimental, attachment, to, and, nostalgia, for, the, theatre, his, first, assignment, designing, sets, after, russia, was, for, the, ballet, aleko, in, 1942, while, living, in, the, us, in, 1945, he, was, also, commissioned, to, design, the, sets, and, costumes, for, stravinsky, s, firebird, these, designs, contributed, greatly, towards, his, enhanced, reputation, in, the, us, as, a, major, artist, and, as, of, 2013, are, still, in, use, by, new, york, city, ballet, cogniat, describes, how, chagall, s, designs, immerse, the, spectator, in, a, luminous, colored, fairy, land, where, forms, are, mistily, defined, and, the, spaces, themselves, seem, animated, with, whirlwinds, or, explosions, his, technique, of, using, theatrical, color, in, this, way, reached, its, peak, when, chagall, returned, to, paris, and, designed, the, sets, for, ravel, s, daphnis, et, chlo, in, 1958, in, 1964, he, repainted, the, ceiling, of, the, paris, opera, using, 2, 400, square, feet, 220, m, 2, of, canvas, he, painted, two, monumental, murals, which, hang, on, opposite, sides, of, the, new, metropolitan, opera, house, at, lincoln, center, in, new, york, which, opened, in, 1966, the, pieces, the, sources, of, music, and, the, triumph, of, music, which, hang, from, the, top, most, balcony, level, and, extend, down, to, the, grand, tier, lobby, level, were, completed, in, france, and, shipped, to, new, york, and, are, covered, by, a, system, of, panels, during, the, hours, in, which, the, opera, house, receives, direct, sunlight, to, prevent, fading, he, also, designed, the, sets, and, costumes, for, a, new, production, of, die, zauberfl, te, for, the, company, which, opened, in, february, 1967, and, was, used, through, the, 1981, 1982, season, chagall, also, designed, tapestries, which, were, woven, under, the, direction, of, yvette, cauquil, prince, who, also, collaborated, with, picasso, these, tapestries, are, much, rarer, than, his, paintings, with, only, 40, of, them, ever, reaching, the, commercial, market, chagall, designed, three, tapestries, for, the, state, hall, of, the, knesset, in, israel, along, with, 12, floor, mosaics, and, a, wall, mosaic, chagall, began, learning, about, ceramics, and, sculpture, while, living, in, south, france, ceramics, became, a, fashion, in, the, c, te, d, azur, with, various, workshops, starting, up, at, antibes, vence, and, vallauris, he, took, classes, along, with, other, known, artists, including, picasso, and, fernand, l, ger, at, first, chagall, painted, existing, pieces, of, pottery, but, soon, expanded, into, designing, his, own, which, began, his, work, as, a, sculptor, as, a, complement, to, his, painting, after, experimenting, with, pottery, and, dishes, he, moved, into, large, ceramic, murals, however, he, was, never, satisfied, with, the, limits, imposed, by, the, square, tile, segments, which, cogniat, notes, imposed, on, him, a, discipline, which, prevented, the, creation, of, a, plastic, image, 76, author, serena, davies, writes, that, by, the, time, he, died, in, france, in, 1985, the, last, surviving, master, of, european, modernism, outliving, joan, mir, by, two, years, he, had, experienced, at, first, hand, the, high, hopes, and, crushing, disappointments, of, the, russian, revolution, and, had, witnessed, the, end, of, the, pale, of, settlement, the, near, annihilation, of, european, jewry, and, the, obliteration, of, vitebsk, his, home, town, where, only, 118, of, a, population, of, 240, 000, survived, the, second, world, war, chagall, s, final, work, was, a, commissioned, piece, of, art, for, the, rehabilitation, institute, of, chicago, the, maquette, painting, titled, job, had, been, completed, but, chagall, died, just, before, the, completion, of, the, tapestry, yvette, cauquil, prince, was, weaving, the, tapestry, under, chagall, s, supervision, and, was, the, last, person, to, work, with, chagall, she, left, vava, and, marc, chagall, s, home, at, 4, pm, on, 28, march, after, discussing, and, matching, the, final, colors, from, the, maquette, painting, for, the, tapestry, he, died, that, evening, his, relationship, with, his, jewish, identity, was, unresolved, and, tragic, davies, states, he, would, have, died, without, jewish, rites, had, not, a, jewish, stranger, stepped, forward, and, said, the, kaddish, the, jewish, prayer, for, the, dead, over, his, coffin, chagall, is, buried, alongside, his, last, wife, valentina, vava, brodsky, chagall, in, the, multi, denominational, cemetery, in, the, traditional, artists, town, of, saint, paul, de, vence, in, the, french, region, of, provence, chagall, biographer, jackie, wullschlager, praises, him, as, a, pioneer, of, modern, art, and, one, of, its, greatest, figurative, painters, invented, a, visual, language, that, recorded, the, thrill, and, terror, of, the, twentieth, century, she, adds, on, his, canvases, we, read, the, triumph, of, modernism, the, breakthrough, in, art, to, an, expression, of, inner, life, that, is, one, of, the, last, century, s, signal, legacies, at, the, same, time, chagall, was, personally, swept, up, in, the, horrors, of, european, history, between, 1914, and, 1945, world, wars, revolution, ethnic, persecution, the, murder, and, exile, of, millions, in, an, age, when, many, major, artists, fled, reality, for, abstraction, he, distilled, his, experiences, of, suffering, and, tragedy, into, images, at, once, immediate, simple, and, symbolic, to, which, everyone, could, respond, 4, art, historians, ingo, walther, and, rainer, metzger, refer, to, chagall, as, a, poet, dreamer, and, exotic, apparition, they, add, that, throughout, his, long, life, the, role, of, outsider, and, artistic, eccentric, came, naturally, to, him, as, he, seemed, to, be, a, kind, of, intermediary, between, worlds, as, a, jew, with, a, lordly, disdain, for, the, ancient, ban, on, image, making, as, a, russian, who, went, beyond, the, realm, of, familiar, self, sufficiency, or, the, son, of, poor, parents, growing, up, in, a, large, and, needy, family, yet, he, went, on, to, establish, himself, in, the, sophisticated, world, of, elegant, artistic, salons, 7, through, his, imagination, and, strong, memories, chagall, was, able, to, use, typical, motifs, and, subjects, in, most, of, his, work, village, scenes, peasant, life, and, intimate, views, of, the, small, world, of, the, jewish, village, shtetl, his, tranquil, figures, and, simple, gestures, helped, produce, a, monumental, sense, of, dignity, by, translating, everyday, jewish, rituals, into, a, timeless, realm, of, iconic, peacefulness, 8, leymarie, writes, that, chagall, transcended, the, limits, of, his, century, he, has, unveiled, possibilities, unsuspected, by, an, art, that, had, lost, touch, with, the, bible, and, in, doing, so, he, has, achieved, a, wholly, new, synthesis, of, jewish, culture, long, ignored, by, painting, he, adds, that, although, chagall, s, art, cannot, be, confined, to, religion, his, most, moving, and, original, contributions, what, he, called, his, message, are, those, drawn, from, religious, or, more, precisely, biblical, sources, x, walther, and, metzger, try, to, summarize, chagall, s, contribution, to, art, his, life, and, art, together, added, up, to, this, image, of, a, lonesome, visionary, a, citizen, of, the, world, with, much, of, the, child, still, in, him, a, stranger, lost, in, wonder, an, image, which, the, artist, did, everything, to, cultivate, profoundly, religious, and, with, a, deep, love, of, the, homeland, his, work, is, arguably, the, most, urgent, appeal, for, tolerance, and, respect, of, all, that, is, different, that, modern, times, could, make, 7, andr, malraux, praised, him, he, said, is, the, greatest, image, maker, of, this, century, he, has,
