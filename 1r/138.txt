of, st, thomas, now, in, the, us, virgin, islands, but, then, in, the, danish, west, indies, his, importance, resides, in, his, contributions, to, both, impressionism, and, post, impressionism, pissarro, studied, from, great, forerunners, including, gustave, courbet, and, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, he, later, studied, and, worked, alongside, georges, seurat, and, paul, signac, when, he, took, on, the, neo, impressionist, style, at, the, age, of, 54, in, 1873, he, helped, establish, a, collective, society, of, fifteen, aspiring, artists, becoming, the, pivotal, figure, in, holding, the, group, together, and, encouraging, the, other, members, art, historian, john, rewald, called, pissarro, the, dean, of, the, impressionist, painters, not, only, because, he, was, the, oldest, of, the, group, but, also, by, virtue, of, his, wisdom, and, his, balanced, kind, and, warmhearted, personality, paul, c, zanne, said, he, was, a, father, for, me, a, man, to, consult, and, a, little, like, the, good, lord, and, he, was, also, one, of, paul, gauguin, s, masters, pierre, auguste, renoir, referred, to, his, work, as, revolutionary, through, his, artistic, portrayals, of, the, common, man, as, pissarro, insisted, on, painting, individuals, in, natural, settings, without, artifice, or, grandeur, pissarro, is, the, only, artist, to, have, shown, his, work, at, all, eight, paris, impressionist, exhibitions, from, 1874, to, 1886, he, acted, as, a, father, figure, not, only, to, the, impressionists, but, to, all, four, of, the, major, post, impressionists, c, zanne, seurat, gauguin, and, van, gogh, jacob, abraham, camille, pissarro, was, born, on, 10, july, 1830, on, the, island, of, st, thomas, to, frederick, abraham, gabriel, pissarro, and, rachel, manzano, pomi, his, father, was, of, portuguese, jewish, descent, and, held, french, nationality, his, mother, was, from, a, french, jewish, family, from, st, thomas, his, father, was, a, merchant, who, came, to, the, island, from, france, to, deal, with, the, hardware, store, of, a, deceased, uncle, isaac, petit, and, married, his, widow, the, marriage, caused, a, stir, within, st, thomas, s, small, jewish, community, because, she, was, previously, married, to, frederick, s, uncle, and, according, to, jewish, law, a, man, is, forbidden, from, marrying, his, aunt, in, subsequent, years, his, four, children, attended, the, all, black, primary, school, upon, his, death, his, will, specified, that, his, estate, be, split, equally, between, the, synagogue, and, st, thomas, protestant, church, when, pissarro, was, twelve, his, father, sent, him, to, boarding, school, in, france, he, studied, at, the, savary, academy, in, passy, near, paris, while, a, young, student, he, developed, an, early, appreciation, of, the, french, art, masters, monsieur, savary, himself, gave, him, a, strong, grounding, in, drawing, and, painting, and, suggested, he, draw, from, nature, when, he, returned, to, st, thomas, after, his, schooling, pissarro, returned, to, st, thomas, at, the, age, of, sixteen, or, seventeen, where, his, father, advocated, pissarro, to, work, in, his, business, as, a, port, clerk, nevertheless, pissarro, took, every, opportunity, during, those, next, five, years, at, the, job, to, practice, drawing, during, breaks, and, after, work, visual, theorist, nicholas, mirzoeff, claims, that, the, young, pissarro, was, inspired, by, the, artworks, of, james, gay, sawkins, a, british, painter, and, geologist, who, lived, in, charlotte, amalie, st, thomas, circa, 1847, pissarro, may, have, attended, art, classes, taught, by, sawkins, and, seen, sawkins, s, paintings, of, mitla, mexico, mirzoeff, states, a, formal, analysis, suggests, that, work, influenced, the, young, pissarro, who, had, just, returned, to, the, island, from, his, school, in, france, soon, afterward, pissarro, began, his, own, drawings, of, the, local, african, population, in, apparent, imitation, of, sawkins, creating, sketches, for, a, postslavery, imagination, when, pissarro, turned, twenty, one, danish, artist, fritz, melbye, then, living, on, st, thomas, inspired, him, to, take, on, painting, as, a, full, time, profession, becoming, his, teacher, and, friend, pissarro, then, chose, to, leave, his, family, and, job, and, live, in, venezuela, where, he, and, melbye, spent, the, next, two, years, working, as, artists, in, caracas, and, la, guaira, he, drew, everything, he, could, including, landscapes, village, scenes, and, numerous, sketches, enough, to, fill, up, multiple, sketchbooks, in, 1855, pissarro, moved, back, to, paris, where, he, began, working, as, an, assistant, to, anton, melbye, fritz, melbye, s, brother, and, also, a, painter, he, also, studied, paintings, by, other, artists, whose, style, impressed, him, courbet, charles, fran, ois, daubigny, jean, fran, ois, millet, and, corot, he, also, enrolled, in, various, classes, taught, by, masters, at, schools, such, as, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, acad, mie, suisse, but, pissarro, eventually, found, their, teaching, methods, stifling, states, art, historian, john, rewald, this, prompted, him, to, search, for, alternative, instruction, which, he, requested, and, received, from, corot, 11, his, initial, paintings, were, in, accord, with, the, standards, at, the, time, to, be, displayed, at, the, paris, salon, the, official, body, whose, academic, traditions, dictated, the, kind, of, art, that, was, acceptable, the, salon, s, annual, exhibition, was, essentially, the, only, marketplace, for, young, artists, to, gain, exposure, as, a, result, pissarro, worked, in, the, traditional, and, prescribed, manner, to, satisfy, the, tastes, of, its, official, committee, in, 1859, his, first, painting, was, accepted, and, exhibited, his, other, paintings, during, that, period, were, influenced, by, camille, corot, who, tutored, him, he, and, corot, shared, a, love, of, rural, scenes, painted, from, nature, it, was, by, corot, that, pissarro, was, inspired, to, paint, outdoors, also, called, plein, air, painting, pissarro, found, corot, along, with, the, work, of, gustave, courbet, to, be, statements, of, pictorial, truth, writes, rewald, he, discussed, their, work, often, jean, fran, ois, millet, was, another, whose, work, he, admired, especially, his, sentimental, renditions, of, rural, life, 12, during, this, period, pissarro, began, to, understand, and, appreciate, the, importance, of, expressing, on, canvas, the, beauties, of, nature, without, adulteration, 12, after, a, year, in, paris, he, therefore, began, to, leave, the, city, and, paint, scenes, in, the, countryside, to, capture, the, daily, reality, of, village, life, he, found, the, french, countryside, to, be, picturesque, and, worthy, of, being, painted, it, was, still, mostly, agricultural, and, sometimes, called, the, golden, age, of, the, peasantry, 17, pissarro, later, explained, the, technique, of, painting, outdoors, to, a, student, corot, would, complete, his, paintings, back, in, his, studio, often, revising, them, according, to, his, preconceptions, pissarro, however, preferred, to, finish, his, paintings, outdoors, often, at, one, sitting, which, gave, his, work, a, more, realistic, feel, as, a, result, his, art, was, sometimes, criticised, as, being, vulgar, because, he, painted, what, he, saw, rutted, and, edged, hodgepodge, of, bushes, mounds, of, earth, and, trees, in, various, stages, of, development, according, to, one, source, such, details, were, equivalent, to, today, s, art, showing, garbage, cans, or, beer, bottles, on, the, side, of, a, street, this, difference, in, style, created, disagreements, between, pissarro, and, corot, in, 1859, while, attending, the, free, school, the, acad, mie, suisse, pissarro, became, friends, with, a, number, of, younger, artists, who, likewise, chose, to, paint, in, the, more, realistic, style, among, them, were, claude, monet, armand, guillaumin, and, paul, c, zanne, what, they, shared, in, common, was, their, dissatisfaction, with, the, dictates, of, the, salon, c, zanne, s, work, had, been, mocked, at, the, time, by, the, others, in, the, school, and, writes, rewald, in, his, later, years, c, zanne, never, forgot, the, sympathy, and, understanding, with, which, pissarro, encouraged, him, 16, as, a, part, of, the, group, pissarro, was, comforted, from, knowing, he, was, not, alone, and, that, others, similarly, struggled, with, their, art, pissarro, agreed, with, the, group, about, the, importance, of, portraying, individuals, in, natural, settings, and, expressed, his, dislike, of, any, artifice, or, grandeur, in, his, works, despite, what, the, salon, demanded, for, its, exhibits, in, 1863, almost, all, of, the, group, s, paintings, were, rejected, by, the, salon, and, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, instead, decided, to, place, their, paintings, in, a, separate, exhibit, hall, the, salon, des, refus, s, however, only, works, of, pissarro, and, c, zanne, were, included, and, the, separate, exhibit, brought, a, hostile, response, from, both, the, officials, of, the, salon, and, the, public, in, subsequent, salon, exhibits, of, 1865, and, 1866, pissarro, acknowledged, his, influences, from, melbye, and, corot, whom, he, listed, as, his, masters, in, the, catalogue, but, in, the, exhibition, of, 1868, he, no, longer, credited, other, artists, as, an, influence, in, effect, declaring, his, independence, as, a, painter, this, was, noted, at, the, time, by, art, critic, and, author, mile, zola, who, offered, his, opinion, another, writer, tries, to, describe, elements, of, pissarro, s, style, and, though, on, orders, from, the, hanging, committee, and, the, marquis, de, chennevi, res, pissarro, s, paintings, of, pontoise, for, example, had, been, skyed, hung, near, the, ceiling, this, did, not, prevent, jules, antoine, castagnary, from, noting, that, the, qualities, of, his, paintings, had, been, observed, by, art, lovers, at, the, age, of, thirty, eight, pissarro, had, begun, to, win, himself, a, reputation, as, a, landscapist, to, rival, corot, and, daubigny, in, the, late, 1860s, or, early, 1870s, pissarro, became, fascinated, with, japanese, prints, which, influenced, his, desire, to, experiment, in, new, compositions, he, described, the, art, to, his, son, lucien, in, 1871, in, croydon, england, he, married, his, mother, s, maid, julie, vellay, a, vineyard, grower, s, daughter, with, whom, he, had, seven, children, six, of, whom, would, become, painters, lucien, pissarro, 1863, 1944, georges, henri, manzana, pissarro, 1871, 1961, f, lix, pissarro, 1874, 1897, ludovic, rodo, pissarro, 1878, 1952, jeanne, bonin, pissarro, 1881, 1948, and, paul, mile, pissarro, 1884, 1972, they, lived, outside, paris, in, pontoise, and, later, in, louveciennes, both, of, which, places, inspired, many, of, his, paintings, including, scenes, of, village, life, along, with, rivers, woods, and, people, at, work, he, also, kept, in, touch, with, the, other, artists, of, his, earlier, group, especially, monet, renoir, c, zanne, and, fr, d, ric, bazille, after, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, having, only, danish, nationality, and, being, unable, to, join, the, army, he, moved, his, family, to, norwood, then, a, village, on, the, edge, of, london, however, his, style, of, painting, which, was, a, forerunner, of, what, was, later, called, impressionism, did, not, do, well, he, wrote, to, his, friend, th, odore, duret, that, my, painting, doesn, t, catch, on, not, at, all, pissarro, met, the, paris, art, dealer, paul, durand, ruel, in, london, who, became, the, dealer, who, helped, sell, his, art, for, most, of, his, life, durand, ruel, put, him, in, touch, with, monet, who, was, likewise, in, london, during, this, period, they, both, viewed, the, work, of, british, landscape, artists, john, constable, and, j, m, w, turner, which, confirmed, their, belief, that, their, style, of, open, air, painting, gave, the, truest, depiction, of, light, and, atmosphere, an, effect, that, they, felt, could, not, be, achieved, in, the, studio, alone, pissarro, s, paintings, also, began, to, take, on, a, more, spontaneous, look, with, loosely, blended, brushstrokes, and, areas, of, impasto, giving, more, depth, to, the, work, through, the, paintings, pissarro, completed, at, this, time, he, records, sydenham, and, the, norwoods, at, a, time, when, they, were, just, recently, connected, by, railways, but, prior, to, the, expansion, of, suburbia, one, of, the, largest, of, these, paintings, is, a, view, of, st, bartholomew, s, church, at, lawrie, park, avenue, commonly, known, as, the, avenue, sydenham, in, the, collection, of, the, national, gallery, in, london, twelve, oil, paintings, date, from, his, stay, in, upper, norwood, and, are, listed, and, illustrated, in, the, catalogue, raisonn, prepared, jointly, by, his, fifth, child, ludovic, rodolphe, pissarro, and, lionello, venturi, and, published, in, 1939, these, paintings, include, lower, norwood, under, snow, and, lordship, lane, station, views, of, the, crystal, palace, relocated, from, hyde, park, dulwich, college, sydenham, hill, all, saints, church, upper, norwood, and, a, lost, painting, of, st, stephen, s, church, returning, to, france, pissarro, lived, in, pontoise, from, 1872, to, 1884, in, 1890, he, again, visited, england, and, painted, some, ten, scenes, of, central, london, he, came, back, again, in, 1892, painting, in, kew, gardens, and, kew, green, and, also, in, 1897, when, he, produced, several, oils, described, as, being, of, bedford, park, chiswick, but, in, fact, all, being, of, the, nearby, stamford, brook, area, except, for, one, of, bath, road, which, runs, from, stamford, brook, along, the, south, edge, of, bedford, park, when, pissarro, returned, to, his, home, in, france, after, the, war, he, discovered, that, of, the, 1, 500, paintings, he, had, done, over, 20, years, which, he, was, forced, to, leave, behind, when, he, moved, to, london, only, 40, remained, the, rest, had, been, damaged, or, destroyed, by, the, soldiers, who, often, used, them, as, floor, mats, outside, in, the, mud, to, keep, their, boots, clean, it, is, assumed, that, many, of, those, lost, were, done, in, the, impressionist, style, he, was, then, developing, thereby, documenting, the, birth, of, impressionism, armand, silvestre, a, critic, went, so, far, as, to, call, pissarro, basically, the, inventor, of, this, painting, however, pissarro, s, role, in, the, impressionist, movement, was, less, that, of, the, great, man, of, ideas, than, that, of, the, good, counselor, and, appeaser, monet, could, be, seen, as, the, guiding, force, 280, 283, he, soon, reestablished, his, friendships, with, the, other, impressionist, artists, of, his, earlier, group, including, c, zanne, monet, manet, renoir, and, degas, pissarro, now, expressed, his, opinion, to, the, group, that, he, wanted, an, alternative, to, the, salon, so, their, group, could, display, their, own, unique, styles, to, assist, in, that, endeavour, in, 1873, he, helped, establish, a, separate, collective, called, the, soci, t, anonyme, des, artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, et, graveurs, which, included, fifteen, artists, pissarro, created, the, group, s, first, charter, and, became, the, pivotal, figure, in, establishing, and, holding, the, group, together, one, writer, noted, that, with, his, prematurely, grey, beard, the, forty, three, year, old, pissarro, was, regarded, as, a, wise, elder, and, father, figure, by, the, group, yet, he, was, able, to, work, alongside, the, other, artists, on, equal, terms, due, to, his, youthful, temperament, and, creativity, another, writer, said, of, him, that, he, has, unchanging, spiritual, youth, and, the, look, of, an, ancestor, who, remained, a, young, man, 36, the, following, year, in, 1874, the, group, held, their, first, impressionist, exhibition, which, shocked, and, horrified, the, critics, who, primarily, appreciated, only, scenes, portraying, religious, historical, or, mythological, settings, they, found, fault, with, the, impressionist, paintings, on, many, grounds, pissarro, showed, five, of, his, paintings, all, landscapes, at, the, exhibit, and, again, mile, zola, praised, his, art, and, that, of, the, others, in, the, impressionist, exhibit, of, 1876, however, art, critic, albert, wolff, complained, in, his, review, try, to, make, m, pissarro, understand, that, trees, are, not, violet, that, sky, is, not, the, color, of, fresh, butter, journalist, and, art, critic, octave, mirbeau, on, the, other, hand, writes, camille, pissarro, has, been, a, revolutionary, through, the, revitalized, working, methods, with, which, he, has, endowed, painting, 36, according, to, rewald, pissarro, had, taken, on, an, attitude, more, simple, and, natural, than, the, other, artists, he, writes, in, later, years, c, zanne, also, recalled, this, period, and, referred, to, pissarro, as, the, first, impressionist, in, 1906, a, few, years, after, pissarro, s, death, c, zanne, then, 67, and, a, role, model, for, the, new, generation, of, artists, paid, pissarro, a, debt, of, gratitude, by, having, himself, listed, in, an, exhibition, catalogue, as, paul, c, zanne, pupil, of, pissarro, 45, pissarro, degas, and, american, impressionist, mary, cassatt, planned, a, journal, of, their, original, prints, in, the, late, 1870s, a, project, that, nevertheless, came, to, nothing, when, degas, withdrew, art, historian, and, the, artist, s, great, grandson, joachim, pissarro, notes, that, they, professed, a, passionate, disdain, for, the, salons, and, refused, to, exhibit, at, them, together, they, shared, an, almost, militant, resolution, against, the, salon, and, through, their, later, correspondences, it, is, clear, that, their, mutual, admiration, was, based, on, a, kinship, of, ethical, as, well, as, aesthetic, concerns, cassatt, had, befriended, degas, and, pissarro, years, earlier, when, she, joined, pissarro, s, newly, formed, french, impressionist, group, and, gave, up, opportunities, to, exhibit, in, the, united, states, she, and, pissarro, were, often, treated, as, two, outsiders, by, the, salon, since, neither, were, french, or, had, become, french, citizens, however, she, was, fired, up, with, the, cause, of, promoting, impressionism, and, looked, forward, to, exhibiting, out, of, solidarity, with, her, new, friends, towards, the, end, of, the, 1890s, she, began, to, distance, herself, from, the, impressionists, avoiding, degas, at, times, as, she, did, not, have, the, strength, to, defend, herself, against, his, wicked, tongue, instead, she, came, to, prefer, the, company, of, the, gentle, camille, pissarro, with, whom, she, could, speak, frankly, about, the, changing, attitudes, toward, art, she, once, described, him, as, a, teacher, that, could, have, taught, the, stones, to, draw, correctly, by, the, 1880s, pissarro, began, to, explore, new, themes, and, methods, of, painting, to, break, out, of, what, he, felt, was, an, artistic, mire, as, a, result, pissarro, went, back, to, his, earlier, themes, by, painting, the, life, of, country, people, which, he, had, done, in, venezuela, in, his, youth, degas, described, pissarro, s, subjects, as, peasants, working, to, make, a, living, however, this, period, also, marked, the, end, of, the, impressionist, period, due, to, pissarro, s, leaving, the, movement, as, joachim, pissarro, points, out, once, such, a, die, hard, impressionist, as, pissarro, had, turned, his, back, on, impressionism, it, was, apparent, that, impressionism, had, no, chance, of, surviving, 52, it, was, pissarro, s, intention, during, this, period, to, help, educate, the, public, by, painting, people, at, work, or, at, home, in, realistic, settings, without, idealising, their, lives, pierre, auguste, renoir, in, 1882, referred, to, pissarro, s, work, during, this, period, as, revolutionary, in, his, attempt, to, portray, the, common, man, pissarro, himself, did, not, use, his, art, to, overtly, preach, any, kind, of, political, message, however, although, his, preference, for, painting, humble, subjects, was, intended, to, be, seen, and, purchased, by, his, upper, class, clientele, he, also, began, painting, with, a, more, unified, brushwork, along, with, pure, strokes, of, color, in, 1885, he, met, georges, seurat, and, paul, signac, both, of, whom, relied, on, a, more, scientific, theory, of, painting, by, using, very, small, patches, of, pure, colours, to, create, the, illusion, of, blended, colours, and, shading, when, viewed, from, a, distance, pissarro, then, spent, the, years, from, 1885, to, 1888, practising, this, more, time, consuming, and, laborious, technique, referred, to, as, pointillism, the, paintings, that, resulted, were, distinctly, different, from, his, impressionist, works, and, were, on, display, in, the, 1886, impressionist, exhibition, but, under, a, separate, section, along, with, works, by, seurat, signac, and, his, son, lucien, all, four, works, were, considered, an, exception, to, the, eighth, exhibition, joachim, pissarro, notes, that, virtually, every, reviewer, who, commented, on, pissarro, s, work, noted, his, extraordinary, capacity, to, change, his, art, revise, his, position, and, take, on, new, challenges, 52, one, critic, writes, pissarro, explained, the, new, art, form, as, a, phase, in, the, logical, march, of, impressionism, 49, but, he, was, alone, among, the, other, impressionists, with, this, attitude, however, joachim, pissarro, states, that, pissarro, thereby, became, the, only, artist, who, went, from, impressionism, to, neo, impressionism, in, 1884, art, dealer, theo, van, gogh, asked, pissarro, if, he, would, take, in, his, older, brother, vincent, as, a, boarder, in, his, home, lucien, pissarro, wrote, that, his, father, was, impressed, by, van, gogh, s, work, and, had, foreseen, the, power, of, this, artist, who, was, 23, years, younger, although, van, gogh, never, boarded, with, him, pissarro, did, explain, to, him, the, various, ways, of, finding, and, expressing, light, and, color, ideas, which, he, later, used, in, his, paintings, notes, lucien, 43, pissarro, eventually, turned, away, from, neo, impressionism, claiming, its, system, was, too, artificial, he, explains, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, however, after, reverting, to, his, earlier, style, his, work, became, according, to, rewald, more, subtle, his, color, scheme, more, refined, his, drawing, firmer, so, it, was, that, pissarro, approached, old, age, with, an, increased, mastery, 41, but, the, change, also, added, to, pissarro, s, continual, financial, hardship, which, he, felt, until, his, 60s, his, headstrong, courage, and, a, tenacity, to, undertake, and, sustain, the, career, of, an, artist, writes, joachim, pissarro, was, due, to, his, lack, of, fear, of, the, immediate, repercussions, of, his, stylistic, decisions, in, addition, his, work, was, strong, enough, to, bolster, his, morale, and, keep, him, going, he, writes, his, impressionist, contemporaries, however, continued, to, view, his, independence, as, a, mark, of, integrity, and, they, turned, to, him, for, advice, referring, to, him, as, p, re, pissarro, father, pissarro, in, his, older, age, pissarro, suffered, from, a, recurring, eye, infection, that, prevented, him, from, working, outdoors, except, in, warm, weather, as, a, result, of, this, disability, he, began, painting, outdoor, scenes, while, sitting, by, the, window, of, hotel, rooms, he, often, chose, hotel, rooms, on, upper, levels, to, get, a, broader, view, he, moved, around, northern, france, and, painted, from, hotels, in, rouen, paris, le, havre, and, dieppe, on, his, visits, to, london, he, would, do, the, same, pissarro, died, in, paris, on, 13, november, 1903, and, was, buried, in, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, during, the, period, pissarro, exhibited, his, works, art, critic, armand, silvestre, had, called, pissarro, the, most, real, and, most, naive, member, of, the, impressionist, group, his, work, has, also, been, described, by, art, historian, diane, kelder, as, expressing, the, same, quiet, dignity, sincerity, and, durability, that, distinguished, his, person, she, adds, that, no,
