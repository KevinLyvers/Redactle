immanuel, kant, born, emanuel, kant, 22, april, 1724, 12, february, 1804, was, a, german, philosopher, and, one, of, the, central, enlightenment, thinkers, born, in, k, nigsberg, kant, s, comprehensive, and, systematic, works, in, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and, aesthetics, have, made, him, one, of, the, most, influential, and, controversial, figures, in, modern, western, philosophy, being, called, the, father, of, modern, ethics, the, father, of, modern, aesthetics, and, for, bringing, together, rationalism, and, empiricism, earned, the, title, of, father, of, modern, philosophy, in, his, doctrine, of, transcendental, idealism, kant, argued, that, space, and, time, are, mere, forms, of, intuition, that, structure, all, experience, and, that, the, objects, of, experience, are, mere, appearances, the, nature, of, things, as, they, are, in, themselves, is, unknowable, to, us, in, an, attempt, to, counter, the, philosophical, doctrine, of, skepticism, he, wrote, the, critique, of, pure, reason, 1781, 1787, his, best, known, work, kant, drew, a, parallel, to, the, copernican, revolution, in, his, proposal, to, think, of, the, objects, of, experience, as, conforming, to, our, spatial, and, temporal, forms, of, intuition, and, the, categories, of, our, understanding, so, that, we, have, a, priori, cognition, of, those, objects, these, claims, have, proved, especially, influential, in, the, social, sciences, particularly, sociology, and, anthropology, which, regard, human, activities, as, pre, oriented, by, cultural, norms, kant, believed, that, reason, is, the, source, of, morality, and, that, aesthetics, arises, from, a, faculty, of, disinterested, judgment, kant, s, religious, views, were, deeply, connected, to, his, moral, theory, their, exact, nature, remains, in, dispute, he, hoped, that, perpetual, peace, could, be, secured, through, an, international, federation, of, republican, states, and, international, cooperation, his, cosmopolitan, reputation, is, called, into, question, by, his, promulgation, of, scientific, racism, for, much, of, his, career, although, he, altered, his, views, on, the, subject, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, immanuel, kant, was, born, on, 22, april, 1724, into, a, prussian, german, family, of, lutheran, faith, in, k, nigsberg, east, prussia, his, mother, anna, regina, reuter, 1697, 1737, was, born, in, k, nigsberg, to, a, father, from, nuremberg, her, surname, is, sometimes, erroneously, given, as, porter, kant, s, father, johann, georg, kant, 1682, 1746, was, a, german, harness, maker, from, memel, at, the, time, prussia, s, most, northeastern, city, now, klaip, da, lithuania, it, is, possible, that, the, kants, got, their, name, from, the, village, of, kantvainiai, german, kantwaggen, today, part, of, priekul, and, were, of, kursenieki, origin, kant, was, baptized, as, emanuel, and, later, changed, the, spelling, of, his, name, to, immanuel, after, learning, hebrew, he, was, the, fourth, of, nine, children, six, of, whom, reached, adulthood, the, kant, household, stressed, the, pietist, values, of, religious, devotion, humility, and, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, the, young, immanuel, s, education, was, strict, punitive, and, disciplinary, and, focused, on, latin, and, religious, instruction, over, mathematics, and, science, in, his, later, years, kant, lived, a, strictly, ordered, life, it, was, said, that, neighbors, would, set, their, clocks, by, his, daily, walks, he, never, married, but, seems, to, have, had, a, rewarding, social, life, he, was, a, popular, teacher, as, well, as, a, modestly, successful, author, even, before, starting, on, his, major, philosophical, works, kant, showed, a, great, aptitude, for, study, at, an, early, age, he, first, attended, the, collegium, fridericianum, from, which, he, graduated, at, the, end, of, the, summer, of, 1740, in, 1740, aged, 16, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, where, he, would, later, remain, for, the, rest, of, his, professional, life, he, studied, the, philosophy, of, gottfried, leibniz, and, christian, wolff, under, martin, knutzen, associate, professor, of, logic, and, metaphysics, from, 1734, until, he, died, in, 1751, a, rationalist, who, was, also, familiar, with, developments, in, british, philosophy, and, science, and, introduced, kant, to, the, new, mathematical, physics, of, isaac, newton, knutzen, dissuaded, kant, from, the, theory, of, pre, established, harmony, which, he, regarded, as, the, pillow, for, the, lazy, mind, he, also, dissuaded, kant, from, idealism, the, idea, that, reality, is, purely, mental, which, most, philosophers, in, the, 18th, century, regarded, negatively, the, theory, of, transcendental, idealism, that, kant, later, included, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, was, developed, partially, in, opposition, to, traditional, idealism, kant, had, contacts, with, students, colleagues, friends, and, diners, who, frequented, the, local, masonic, lodge, his, father, s, stroke, and, subsequent, death, in, 1746, interrupted, his, studies, kant, left, k, nigsberg, shortly, after, august, 1748, he, would, return, there, in, august, 1754, he, became, a, private, tutor, in, the, towns, surrounding, k, nigsberg, but, continued, his, scholarly, research, in, 1749, he, published, his, first, philosophical, work, thoughts, on, the, true, estimation, of, living, forces, written, in, 1745, 1747, kant, is, best, known, for, his, work, in, the, philosophy, of, ethics, and, metaphysics, but, he, made, significant, contributions, to, other, disciplines, in, 1754, while, contemplating, on, a, prize, question, by, the, berlin, academy, about, the, problem, of, earth, s, rotation, he, argued, that, the, moon, s, gravity, would, slow, down, earth, s, spin, and, he, also, put, forth, the, argument, that, gravity, would, eventually, cause, the, moon, s, tidal, locking, to, coincide, with, the, earth, s, rotation, the, next, year, he, expanded, this, reasoning, to, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, in, his, universal, natural, history, and, theory, of, the, heavens, in, 1755, kant, received, a, license, to, lecture, in, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, and, began, lecturing, on, a, variety, of, topics, including, mathematics, physics, logic, and, metaphysics, in, his, 1756, essay, on, the, theory, of, winds, kant, laid, out, an, original, insight, into, the, coriolis, force, in, 1756, kant, also, published, three, papers, on, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, kant, s, theory, which, involved, shifts, in, huge, caverns, filled, with, hot, gases, though, inaccurate, was, one, of, the, first, systematic, attempts, to, explain, earthquakes, in, natural, rather, than, supernatural, terms, in, 1757, kant, began, lecturing, on, geography, making, him, one, of, the, first, lecturers, to, explicitly, teach, geography, as, its, own, subject, geography, was, one, of, kant, s, most, popular, lecturing, topics, and, in, 1802, a, compilation, by, friedrich, theodor, rink, of, kant, s, lecturing, notes, physical, geography, was, released, after, kant, became, a, professor, in, 1770, he, expanded, the, topics, of, his, lectures, to, include, lectures, on, natural, law, ethics, and, anthropology, along, with, other, topics, in, the, universal, natural, history, kant, laid, out, the, nebular, hypothesis, in, which, he, deduced, that, the, solar, system, had, formed, from, a, large, cloud, of, gas, a, nebula, kant, also, correctly, deduced, that, the, milky, way, was, a, large, disk, of, stars, which, he, theorized, formed, from, a, much, larger, spinning, gas, cloud, he, further, suggested, that, other, distant, nebulae, might, be, other, galaxies, these, postulations, opened, new, horizons, for, astronomy, for, the, first, time, extending, it, beyond, the, solar, system, to, galactic, and, intergalactic, realms, from, then, on, kant, turned, increasingly, to, philosophical, issues, although, he, continued, to, write, on, the, sciences, throughout, his, life, in, the, early, 1760s, kant, produced, a, series, of, important, works, in, philosophy, the, false, subtlety, of, the, four, syllogistic, figures, a, work, in, logic, was, published, in, 1762, two, more, works, appeared, the, following, year, attempt, to, introduce, the, concept, of, negative, magnitudes, into, philosophy, and, the, only, possible, argument, in, support, of, a, demonstration, of, the, existence, of, god, by, 1764, kant, had, become, a, notable, popular, author, and, wrote, observations, on, the, feeling, of, the, beautiful, and, sublime, he, was, second, to, moses, mendelssohn, in, a, berlin, academy, prize, competition, with, his, inquiry, concerning, the, distinctness, of, the, principles, of, natural, theology, and, morality, often, referred, to, as, the, prize, essay, in, 1766, kant, wrote, a, critical, piece, on, emanuel, swedenborg, s, dreams, of, a, spirit, seer, in, 1770, kant, was, appointed, full, professor, of, logic, and, metaphysics, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, in, defense, of, this, appointment, kant, wrote, his, inaugural, dissertation, on, the, form, and, principles, of, the, sensible, and, the, intelligible, world, this, work, saw, the, emergence, of, several, central, themes, of, his, mature, work, including, the, distinction, between, the, faculties, of, intellectual, thought, and, sensible, receptivity, to, miss, this, distinction, would, mean, to, commit, the, error, of, subreption, and, as, he, says, in, the, last, chapter, of, the, dissertation, only, in, avoiding, this, error, does, metaphysics, flourish, it, is, often, claimed, that, kant, was, a, late, developer, that, he, only, became, an, important, philosopher, in, his, mid, 50, s, after, rejecting, his, earlier, views, while, it, is, true, that, kant, wrote, his, greatest, works, relatively, late, in, life, there, is, a, tendency, to, underestimate, the, value, of, his, earlier, works, recent, kant, scholarship, has, devoted, more, attention, to, these, pre, critical, writings, and, has, recognized, a, degree, of, continuity, with, his, mature, work, at, age, 46, kant, was, an, established, scholar, and, an, increasingly, influential, philosopher, and, much, was, expected, of, him, in, correspondence, with, his, ex, student, and, friend, markus, herz, kant, admitted, that, in, the, inaugural, dissertation, he, had, failed, to, account, for, the, relation, between, our, sensible, and, intellectual, faculties, he, needed, to, explain, how, we, combine, what, is, known, as, sensory, knowledge, with, the, other, type, of, knowledge, that, is, reasoned, knowledge, these, two, being, related, but, having, very, different, processes, kant, also, credited, david, hume, with, awakening, him, from, a, dogmatic, slumber, in, which, he, had, unquestioningly, accepted, the, tenets, of, both, religion, and, natural, philosophy, hume, in, his, 1739, treatise, on, human, nature, had, argued, that, we, only, know, the, mind, through, a, subjective, essentially, illusory, series, of, perceptions, ideas, such, as, causality, morality, and, objects, are, not, evident, in, experience, so, their, reality, may, be, questioned, kant, felt, that, reason, could, remove, this, skepticism, and, he, set, himself, to, solving, these, problems, although, fond, of, company, and, conversation, with, others, kant, isolated, himself, and, resisted, friends, attempts, to, bring, him, out, of, his, isolation, when, kant, emerged, from, his, silence, in, 1781, the, result, was, the, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, countered, hume, s, empiricism, by, claiming, that, some, knowledge, exists, inherently, in, the, mind, independent, of, experience, he, drew, a, parallel, to, the, copernican, revolution, in, his, proposal, that, worldly, objects, can, be, intuited, a, priori, and, that, intuition, is, consequently, distinct, from, objective, reality, perhaps, the, most, direct, contested, matter, was, hume, s, argument, against, any, necessary, connection, between, causal, events, which, hume, characterized, as, the, cement, of, the, universe, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, argues, for, what, he, takes, to, be, the, a, priori, justification, of, such, necessary, connection, although, now, recognized, as, one, of, the, greatest, works, in, the, history, of, philosophy, the, critique, disappointed, kant, s, readers, upon, its, initial, publication, the, book, was, long, over, 800, pages, in, the, original, german, edition, and, written, in, a, convoluted, style, kant, was, quite, upset, with, its, reception, his, former, student, johann, gottfried, herder, criticized, it, for, placing, reason, as, an, entity, worthy, of, criticism, instead, of, considering, the, process, of, reasoning, within, the, context, of, language, and, one, s, entire, personality, similar, to, christian, garve, and, johann, georg, heinrich, feder, he, rejected, kant, s, position, that, space, and, time, possessed, a, form, that, could, be, analyzed, additionally, garve, and, feder, also, faulted, kant, s, critique, for, not, explaining, differences, in, perception, of, sensations, its, density, made, it, as, herder, said, in, a, letter, to, johann, georg, hamann, a, tough, nut, to, crack, obscured, by, all, this, heavy, gossamer, its, reception, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, praise, kant, had, received, for, earlier, works, such, as, his, prize, essay, and, shorter, works, that, preceded, the, first, critique, recognizing, the, need, to, clarify, the, original, treatise, kant, wrote, the, prolegomena, to, any, future, metaphysics, in, 1783, as, a, summary, of, its, main, views, shortly, thereafter, kant, s, friend, johann, friedrich, schultz, 1739, 1805, a, professor, of, mathematics, published, explanations, of, professor, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, k, nigsberg, 1784, which, was, a, brief, but, very, accurate, commentary, on, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, s, reputation, gradually, rose, through, the, latter, portion, of, the, 1780s, sparked, by, a, series, of, important, works, the, 1784, essay, answer, to, the, question, what, is, enlightenment, 1785, s, groundwork, of, the, metaphysics, of, morals, his, first, work, on, moral, philosophy, and, metaphysical, foundations, of, natural, science, from, 1786, kant, s, fame, ultimately, arrived, from, an, unexpected, source, in, 1786, karl, leonhard, reinhold, published, a, series, of, public, letters, on, kantian, philosophy, in, these, letters, reinhold, framed, kant, s, philosophy, as, a, response, to, the, central, intellectual, controversy, of, the, era, the, pantheism, controversy, friedrich, jacobi, had, accused, the, recently, deceased, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, a, distinguished, dramatist, and, philosophical, essayist, of, spinozism, such, a, charge, tantamount, to, an, accusation, of, atheism, was, vigorously, denied, by, lessing, s, friend, moses, mendelssohn, leading, to, a, bitter, public, dispute, among, partisans, the, controversy, gradually, escalated, into, a, debate, about, the, values, of, the, enlightenment, and, the, value, of, reason, reinhold, maintained, in, his, letters, that, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, could, settle, this, dispute, by, defending, the, authority, and, bounds, of, reason, reinhold, s, letters, were, widely, read, and, made, kant, the, most, famous, philosopher, of, his, era, kant, published, a, second, edition, of, the, critique, of, pure, reason, in, 1787, heavily, revising, the, first, parts, of, the, book, most, of, his, subsequent, work, focused, on, other, areas, of, philosophy, he, continued, to, develop, his, moral, philosophy, notably, in, 1788, s, critique, of, practical, reason, known, as, the, second, critique, and, 1797, s, metaphysics, of, morals, the, 1790, critique, of, the, power, of, judgment, the, third, critique, applied, the, kantian, system, to, aesthetics, and, teleology, in, 1792, kant, s, attempt, to, publish, the, second, of, the, four, pieces, of, religion, within, the, bounds, of, bare, reason, in, the, journal, berlinische, monatsschrift, met, with, opposition, from, the, king, s, censorship, commission, which, had, been, established, that, same, year, in, the, context, of, the, french, revolution, kant, then, arranged, to, have, all, four, pieces, published, as, a, book, routing, it, through, the, philosophy, department, at, the, university, of, jena, to, avoid, the, need, for, theological, censorship, this, insubordination, earned, him, a, now, famous, reprimand, from, the, king, when, he, nevertheless, published, a, second, edition, in, 1794, the, censor, was, so, irate, that, he, arranged, for, a, royal, order, that, required, kant, never, to, publish, or, even, speak, publicly, about, religion, kant, then, published, his, response, to, the, king, s, reprimand, and, explained, himself, in, the, preface, of, the, conflict, of, the, faculties, he, also, wrote, a, number, of, semi, popular, essays, on, history, religion, politics, and, other, topics, these, works, were, well, received, by, kant, s, contemporaries, and, confirmed, his, preeminent, status, in, eighteenth, century, philosophy, there, were, several, journals, devoted, solely, to, defending, and, criticizing, kantian, philosophy, despite, his, success, philosophical, trends, were, moving, in, another, direction, many, of, kant, s, most, important, disciples, and, followers, including, reinhold, beck, and, fichte, transformed, the, kantian, position, the, progressive, stages, of, revision, of, kant, s, teachings, marked, the, emergence, of, german, idealism, in, what, was, one, of, his, final, acts, expounding, a, stance, on, philosophical, questions, kant, opposed, these, developments, and, publicly, denounced, fichte, in, an, open, letter, in, 1799, in, 1800, a, student, of, kant, named, gottlob, benjamin, j, sche, 1762, 1842, published, a, manual, of, logic, for, teachers, called, logik, which, he, had, prepared, at, kant, s, request, j, sche, prepared, the, logik, using, a, copy, of, a, textbook, in, logic, by, georg, friedrich, meier, entitled, excerpt, from, the, doctrine, of, reason, in, which, kant, had, written, copious, notes, and, annotations, the, logik, has, been, considered, of, fundamental, importance, to, kant, s, philosophy, and, the, understanding, of, it, the, great, 19th, century, logician, charles, sanders, peirce, remarked, in, an, incomplete, review, of, thomas, kingsmill, abbott, s, english, translation, of, the, introduction, to, logik, that, kant, s, whole, philosophy, turns, upon, his, logic, also, robert, schirokauer, hartman, and, wolfgang, schwarz, wrote, in, the, translators, introduction, to, their, english, translation, of, the, logik, its, importance, lies, not, only, in, its, significance, for, the, critique, of, pure, reason, the, second, part, of, which, is, a, restatement, of, fundamental, tenets, of, the, logic, but, in, its, position, within, the, whole, of, kant, s, work, kant, s, health, long, poor, worsened, he, died, at, k, nigsberg, on, 12, february, 1804, uttering, es, ist, gut, it, is, good, before, expiring, his, unfinished, final, work, was, published, as, opus, postumum, kant, always, cut, a, curious, figure, in, his, lifetime, for, his, modest, rigorously, scheduled, habits, which, have, been, referred, to, as, clocklike, heinrich, heine, observed, the, magnitude, of, his, destructive, world, crushing, thoughts, and, considered, him, a, sort, of, philosophical, executioner, comparing, him, to, robespierre, with, the, observation, that, both, men, represented, in, the, highest, the, type, of, provincial, bourgeois, nature, had, destined, them, to, weigh, coffee, and, sugar, but, fate, determined, that, they, should, weigh, other, things, and, placed, on, the, scales, of, the, one, a, king, on, the, scales, of, the, other, a, god, when, his, body, was, transferred, to, a, new, burial, spot, his, skull, was, measured, during, the, exhumation, and, found, to, be, larger, than, the, average, german, male, s, with, a, high, and, broad, forehead, his, forehead, has, been, an, object, of, interest, ever, since, it, became, well, known, through, his, portraits, in, d, bler, s, portrait, and, in, kiefer, s, faithful, if, expressionistic, reproduction, of, it, as, well, as, in, many, of, the, other, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, century, portraits, of, kant, the, forehead, is, remarkably, large, and, decidedly, retreating, kant, s, mausoleum, adjoins, the, northeast, corner, of, k, nigsberg, cathedral, in, kaliningrad, russia, the, mausoleum, was, constructed, by, the, architect, friedrich, lahrs, and, was, finished, in, 1924, in, time, for, the, bicentenary, of, kant, s, birth, originally, kant, was, buried, inside, the, cathedral, but, in, 1880, his, remains, were, moved, to, a, neo, gothic, chapel, adjoining, the, northeast, corner, of, the, cathedral, over, the, years, the, chapel, became, dilapidated, and, was, demolished, to, make, way, for, the, mausoleum, which, was, built, on, the, same, location, the, tomb, and, its, mausoleum, are, among, the, few, artifacts, of, german, times, preserved, by, the, soviets, after, they, captured, the, city, into, the, 21st, century, many, newlyweds, bring, flowers, to, the, mausoleum, artifacts, previously, owned, by, kant, known, as, kantiana, were, included, in, the, k, nigsberg, city, museum, however, the, museum, was, destroyed, during, world, war, ii, a, replica, of, the, statue, of, kant, that, in, german, times, stood, in, front, of, the, main, university, of, k, nigsberg, building, was, donated, by, a, german, entity, in, the, early, 1990s, and, placed, in, the, same, grounds, after, the, expulsion, of, k, nigsberg, s, german, population, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, where, kant, taught, was, replaced, by, the, russian, language, kaliningrad, state, university, which, appropriated, the, campus, and, surviving, buildings, in, 2005, the, university, was, renamed, immanuel, kant, state, university, of, russia, the, name, change, which, was, considered, a, politically, charged, issue, due, to, the, residents, having, mixed, feelings, about, its, german, past, was, announced, at, a, ceremony, attended, by, russian, president, vladimir, putin, and, german, chancellor, gerhard, schr, der, and, the, university, formed, a, kant, society, dedicated, to, the, study, of, kantianism, in, 2010, the, university, was, again, renamed, to, immanuel, kant, baltic, federal, university, like, many, of, his, contemporaries, kant, was, greatly, impressed, with, the, scientific, advances, made, by, newton, and, others, this, new, evidence, of, the, power, of, human, reason, called, into, question, for, many, the, traditional, authority, of, politics, and, religion, in, particular, the, modern, mechanistic, view, of, the, world, called, into, question, the, very, possibility, of, morality, for, if, there, is, no, agency, there, cannot, be, any, responsibility, the, aim, of, kant, s, critical, project, is, to, secure, human, autonomy, the, basis, of, religion, and, morality, from, this, threat, of, mechanism, and, to, do, so, in, a, way, that, preserves, the, advances, of, modern, science, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, summarizes, his, philosophical, concerns, in, the, following, three, questions, the, critique, of, pure, reason, focuses, upon, the, first, question, and, opens, a, conceptual, space, for, an, answer, to, the, second, question, it, argues, that, even, though, we, cannot, strictly, know, that, we, are, free, we, can, and, for, practical, purposes, must, think, of, ourselves, as, free, in, kant, s, own, words, i, had, to, deny, knowledge, in, order, to, make, room, for, faith, our, rational, faith, in, morality, is, further, developed, in, the, groundwork, of, the, metaphysics, of, morals, and, the, critique, of, practical, reason, the, critique, of, the, power, of, judgment, argues, we, may, rationally, hope, for, the, harmonious, unity, of, the, theoretical, and, practical, domains, treated, in, the, first, two, critiques, on, the, basis, not, only, of, its, conceptual, possibility, but, also, on, the, basis, of, our, affective, experience, of, natural, beauty, and, more, generally, the, organization, of, the, natural, world, in, religion, within, the, bounds, of, mere, reason, kant, endeavors, to, complete, his, answer, to, this, third, question, these, works, all, place, the, active, rational, human, subject, at, the, center, of, the, cognitive, and, moral, worlds, in, brief, kant, argues, that, the, mind, itself, necessarily, makes, a, constitutive, contribution, to, knowledge, that, this, contribution, is, transcendental, rather, than, psychological, and, that, to, act, autonomously, is, to, act, according, to, rational, moral, principles, kant, s, 1781, revised, 1787, book, the, critique, of, pure, reason, has, often, been, cited, as, the, most, significant, volume, of, metaphysics, and, epistemology, in, modern, philosophy, in, the, first, critique, and, later, on, in, other, works, as, well, kant, frames, the, general, and, real, problem, of, pure, reason, in, terms, of, the, following, question, how, are, synthetic, judgments, a, priori, possible, to, understand, this, claim, it, is, necessary, to, define, some, terms, first, kant, makes, a, distinction, between, two, sources, of, knowledge, second, he, makes, a, distinction, in, terms, of, the, form, of, knowledge, an, analytic, proposition, is, true, by, nature, of, strictly, conceptual, relations, all, analytic, propositions, are, a, priori, it, is, analytically, true, that, no, analytic, proposition, could, be, a, posteriori, by, contrast, a, synthetic, proposition, is, one, the, content, of, which, includes, something, new, the, truth, or, falsehood, of, a, synthetic, statement, depends, upon, something, more, than, what, is, contained, in, its, concepts, the, most, obvious, form, of, synthetic, proposition, is, a, simple, empirical, observation, philosophers, such, as, david, hume, believed, that, these, were, the, only, possible, kinds, of, human, reason, and, investigation, which, he, called, relations, of, ideas, and, matters, of, fact, establishing, the, synthetic, a, priori, as, a, third, mode, of, knowledge, would, allow, kant, to, push, back, against, hume, s, skepticism, about, such, matters, as, causation, and, metaphysical, knowledge, more, generally, this, is, because, unlike, a, posteriori, cognition, a, priori, cognition, has, true, or, strict, universality, and, includes, a, claim, of, necessity, kant, himself, regards, it, as, uncontroversial, that, we, do, have, synthetic, a, priori, knowledge, most, obviously, that, of, mathematics, that, 7, 5, 12, he, claims, is, a, result, not, contained, in, the, concepts, of, seven, five, and, the, addition, operation, yet, although, he, considers, the, possibility, of, such, knowledge, to, be, obvious, kant, nevertheless, assumes, the, burden, of, providing, a, philosophical, proof, that, we, have, a, priori, knowledge, in, mathematics, the, natural, sciences, and, metaphysics, it, is, the, twofold, aim, of, the, critique, both, to, prove, and, to, explain, the, possibility, of, this, knowledge, kant, says, there, are, two, stems, of, human, cognition, which, may, perhaps, arise, from, a, common, but, to, us, unknown, root, namely, sensibility, and, understanding, through, the, first, of, which, objects, are, given, to, us, but, through, the, second, of, which, they, are, thought, kant, s, term, for, the, object, of, sensibility, is, intuition, and, his, term, for, the, object, of, the, understanding, is, concept, in, general, terms, the, former, is, a, non, discursive, representation, of, a, particular, object, and, the, latter, is, a, discursive, or, mediate, representation, of, a, general, type, of, object, the, conditions, of, possible, experience, require, both, intuitions, and, concepts, that, is, the, affection, of, the, receptive, sensibility, and, the, actively, synthesizing, power, of, the, understanding, thus, the, statement, thoughts, without, content, are, empty, intuitions, without, concepts, are, blind, kant, s, basic, strategy, in, the, first, half, of, his, book, will, be, to, argue, that, some, intuitions, and, concepts, are, pure, that, is, are, contributed, entirely, by, the, mind, independent, of, anything, empirical, knowledge, generated, on, this, basis, under, certain, conditions, can, be, synthetic, a, priori, this, insight, is, known, as, kant, s, copernican, revolution, because, just, as, copernicus, advanced, astronomy, by, way, of, a, radical, shift, in, perspective, so, kant, here, claims, do, the, same, for, metaphysics, the, second, half, of, the, critique, is, the, explicitly, critical, part, in, this, transcendental, dialectic, kant, argues, that, many, of, the, claims, of, traditional, rationalist, metaphysics, violate, the, criteria, he, claims, to, establish, in, the, first, constructive, part, of, his, book, as, kant, observes, human, reason, without, being, moved, by, the, mere, vanity, of, knowing, it, all, inexorably, pushes, on, driven, by, its, own, need, to, such, questions, that, cannot, be, answered, by, any, experiential, use, of, reason, it, is, the, project, of, the, critique, of, pure, reason, to, establish, the, limits, as, to, just, how, far, reason, may, legitimately, so, proceed, the, section, of, the, critique, entitled, the, transcendental, aesthetic, introduces, kant, s, famous, metaphysics, of, transcendental, idealism, something, is, transcendental, if, it, is, a, necessary, condition, for, the, possibility, of, experience, and, idealism, denotes, some, form, of, mind, dependence, that, must, be, further, specified, the, correct, interpretation, of, kant, s, own, specification, remains, controversial, the, metaphysical, thesis, then, states, that, human, beings, only, experience, and, know, phenomenal, appearances, not, independent, things, in, themselves, because, space, and, time, are, nothing, but, the, subjective, forms, of, intuition, that, we, ourselves, contribute, to, experience, nevertheless, although, kant, says, that, space, and, time, are, transcendentally, ideal, the, pure, forms, of, human, sensibility, rather, than, part, of, nature, or, reality, as, it, exists, in, itself, he, also, claims, that, they, are, empirically, real, by, which, he, means, that, everything, that, can, come, before, us, externally, as, an, object, is, in, both, space, and, time, and, that, our, internal, intuitions, of, ourselves, are, in, time, however, kant, s, doctrine, is, interpreted, he, wished, to, distinguish, his, position, from, the, subjective, idealism, of, berkeley, paul, guyer, although, critical, of, many, of, kant, s, arguments, in, this, section, writes, of, the, transcendental, aesthetic, that, it, not, only, lays, the, first, stone, in, kant, s, constructive, theory, of, knowledge, it, also, lays, the, foundation, for, both, his, critique, and, his, reconstruction, of, traditional, metaphysics, it, argues, that, all, genuine, knowledge, requires, a, sensory, component, and, thus, that, metaphysical, claims, that, transcend, the, possibility, of, sensory, confirmation, can, never, amount, to, knowledge, one, interpretation, known, as, the, two, world, interpretation, regards, kant, s, position, as, a, statement, of, epistemological, limitation, meaning, that, we, are, not, able, to, transcend, the, bounds, of, our, own, mind, and, therefore, cannot, access, the, thing, in, itself, on, this, particular, view, the, thing, in, itself, is, not, numerically, identical, to, the, phenomenal, empirical, object, kant, also, spoke, of, the, thing, in, itself, or, transcendent, object, as, a, product, of, the, human, understanding, as, it, attempts, to, conceive, of, objects, in, abstraction, from, the, conditions, of, sensibility, following, this, line, of, thought, some, interpreters, argue, that, the, thing, in, itself, does, not, represent, a, separate, ontological, domain, but, simply, a, way, of, considering, objects, by, means, of, the, understanding, alone, this, is, known, as, the, two, aspect, view, on, this, alternative, view, the, same, objects, to, which, we, attribute, empirical, properties, like, color, size, and, shape, are, also, when, considered, as, they, are, in, themselves, the, things, in, themselves, otherwise, inaccessible, to, human, knowledge, following, the, transcendental, analytic, is, the, transcendental, logic, whereas, the, former, was, concerned, with, the, contributions, of, the, sensibility, the, latter, is, concerned, first, with, the, contributions, of, the, understanding, transcendental, analytic, and, second, with, the, faculty, of, reason, as, the, source, of, both, metaphysical, errors, and, genuine, regulatory, principles, transcendental, dialectic, the, transcendental, analytic, is, further, divided, into, two, sections, the, first, analytic, of, concepts, is, concerned, with, establishing, the, universality, and, necessity, of, the, pure, concepts, of, the, understanding, i, e, the, categories, this, section, contains, kant, s, famous, transcendental, deduction, the, second, analytic, of, principles, is, concerned, with, the, application, of, those, pure, concepts, in, empirical, judgments, this, second, section, is, longer, than, the, first, and, is, further, divided, into, many, sub, sections, the, analytic, of, concepts, argues, for, the, universal, and, necessary, validity, of, the, pure, concepts, of, the, understanding, or, the, categories, for, instance, the, concepts, of, substance, and, causation, these, twelve, basic, categories, define, what, it, is, to, be, a, thing, in, general, that, is, they, articulate, the, necessary, conditions, according, to, which, something, is, a, possible, object, of, experience, these, in, conjunction, with, the, a, priori, forms, of, intuition, are, the, basis, of, all, synthetic, a, priori, cognition, according, to, guyer, and, wood, kant, s, idea, is, that, just, as, there, are, certain, essential, features, of, all, judgments, so, there, must, be, certain, corresponding, ways, in, which, we, form, the, concepts, of, objects, so, that, judgments, may, be, about, objects, kant, provides, two, central, lines, of, argumentation, in, support, of, his, claims, about, the, categories, the, first, known, as, the, metaphysical, deduction, proceeds, analytically, from, a, table, of, the, aristotelian, logical, functions, of, judgment, as, kant, was, aware, this, assumes, precisely, what, the, skeptic, rejects, namely, the, existence, of, synthetic, a, priori, cognition, for, this, reason, kant, also, supplies, a, synthetic, argument, that, does, not, depend, upon, the, assumption, in, dispute, this, argument, provided, under, the, heading, transcendental, deduction, of, the, pure, concepts, of, the, understanding, is, widely, considered, to, be, both, the, most, important, and, the, most, difficult, of, kant, s, arguments, in, the, critique, kant, himself, said, that, it, is, the, one, that, cost, him, the, most, labor, frustrated, by, its, confused, reception, in, the, first, edition, of, his, book, he, rewrote, it, entirely, for, the, second, edition, the, transcendental, deduction, gives, kant, s, argument, that, these, pure, concepts, apply, universally, and, necessarily, to, the, objects, that, are, given, in, experience, according, to, guyer, and, wood, he, centers, his, argument, on, the, premise, that, our, experience, can, be, ascribed, to, a, single, identical, subject, via, what, he, calls, the, transcendental, unity, of, apperception, only, if, the, elements, of, experience, given, in, intuition, are, synthetically, combined, so, as, to, present, us, with, objects, that, are, thought, through, the, categories, kant, s, principle, of, apperception, is, that, the, i, think, must, be, able, to, accompany, all, my, representations, for, otherwise, something, would, be, represented, in, me, that, could, not, be, thought, at, all, which, is, as, much, as, to, say, that, the, representation, would, either, be, impossible, or, else, at, least, would, be, nothing, for, me, the, necessary, possibility, of, the, self, ascription, of, the, representations, of, self, consciousness, identical, to, itself, through, time, is, an, a, priori, conceptual, truth, that, cannot, be, based, on, experience, this, is, only, a, bare, sketch, of, one, of, the, arguments, that, kant, presents, kant, s, deduction, of, the, categories, in, the, analytic, of, concepts, if, successful, demonstrates, its, claims, about, the, categories, only, in, an, abstract, way, the, task, of, the, analytic, of, principles, is, to, show, both, that, they, must, universally, apply, to, objects, given, in, actual, experience, i, e, manifolds, of, intuition, and, how, it, is, they, do, so, in, the, first, book, of, this, section, on, the, schematism, kant, connects, each, of, the, purely, logical, categories, of, the, understanding, to, the, temporality, of, intuition, to, show, that, although, non, empirical, they, do, have, purchase, upon, the, objects, of, experience, the, second, book, continues, this, line, of, argument, in, four, chapters, each, associated, with, one, of, the, category, groupings, in, some, cases, it, adds, a, connection, to, the, spatial, dimension, of, intuition, to, the, categories, it, analyzes, the, fourth, chapter, of, this, section, the, analogies, of, experience, marks, a, shift, from, mathematical, to, dynamical, principles, that, is, to, those, that, deal, with, relations, among, objects, some, commentators, consider, this, the, most, significant, section, of, the, critique, the, analogies, are, three, in, number, the, fourth, section, of, this, chapter, which, is, not, an, analogy, deals, with, the, empirical, use, of, the, modal, categories, that, was, the, end, of, the, chapter, in, the, a, edition, of, the, critique, the, b, edition, includes, one, more, short, section, the, refutation, of, idealism, in, this, section, by, analysis, of, the, concept, of, self, consciousness, kant, argues, that, his, transcendental, idealism, is, a, critical, or, formal, idealism, that, does, not, deny, the, existence, of, reality, apart, from, our, subjective, representations, the, final, chapter, of, the, analytic, of, principles, distinguishes, phenomena, of, which, we, can, have, genuine, knowledge, from, noumena, a, term, which, refers, to, objects, of, pure, thought, that, we, cannot, know, but, to, which, we, may, still, refer, in, a, negative, sense, an, appendix, to, the, section, further, develops, kant, s, criticism, of, leibnizian, wolffian, rationalism, by, arguing, that, its, dogmatic, metaphysics, confuses, the, mere, features, of, concepts, through, which, we, think, things, features, of, the, objects, themselves, against, this, kant, reasserts, his, own, insistence, upon, the, necessity, of, a, sensible, component, in, all, genuine, knowledge, the, second, of, the, two, divisions, of, the, transcendental, logic, the, transcendental, dialectic, contains, the, negative, portion, of, kant, s, critique, which, builds, upon, the, positive, arguments, of, the, preceding, transcendental, analytic, to, expose, the, limits, of, metaphysical, speculation, in, particular, it, is, concerned, to, demonstrate, as, spurious, the, efforts, of, reason, to, arrive, at, knowledge, independent, of, sensibility, this, endeavor, kant, argues, is, doomed, to, failure, which, he, claims, to, demonstrate, by, showing, that, reason, unbounded, by, sense, is, always, capable, of, generating, opposing, or, otherwise, incompatible, conclusions, like, the, light, dove, in, free, flight, cutting, through, the, air, the, resistance, of, which, it, feels, reason, could, get, the, idea, that, it, could, do, even, better, in, airless, space, against, this, kant, claims, that, absent, epistemic, friction, there, can, be, no, knowledge, nevertheless, kant, s, critique, is, not, entirely, destructive, he, presents, the, speculative, excesses, of, traditional, metaphysics, as, inherent, in, our, very, capacity, of, reason, moreover, he, argues, that, its, products, are, not, without, some, carefully, qualified, regulative, value, kant, calls, the, basic, concepts, of, metaphysics, ideas, they, are, different, from, the, concepts, of, understanding, in, that, they, are, not, limited, by, the, critical, stricture, limiting, knowledge, to, the, conditions, of, possible, experience, and, its, objects, transcendental, illusion, is, kant, s, term, for, the, tendency, of, reason, to, produce, such, ideas, although, reason, has, a, logical, use, of, simply, drawing, inferences, from, principles, in, the, transcendental, dialectic, kant, is, concerned, with, its, purportedly, real, use, to, arrive, at, conclusions, by, way, of, unchecked, regressive, syllogistic, ratiocination, the, three, categories, of, relation, pursued, without, regard, to, the, limits, of, possible, experience, yield, the, three, central, ideas, of, traditional, metaphysics, although, kant, denies, that, these, ideas, can, be, objects, of, genuine, cognition, he, argues, that, they, are, the, result, of, reason, s, inherent, drive, to, unify, cognition, into, a, systematic, whole, leibnizian, wolffian, metaphysics, was, divided, into, four, parts, ontology, psychology, cosmology, and, theology, kant, replaces, the, first, with, the, positive, results, of, the, first, part, of, the, critique, he, proposes, to, replace, the, following, three, with, his, later, doctrines, of, anthropology, the, metaphysical, foundations, of, natural, science, and, the, critical, postulation, of, human, freedom, and, morality, in, the, second, of, the, two, books, of, the, transcendental, dialectic, kant, undertakes, to, demonstrate, the, contradictory, nature, of, unbounded, reason, he, does, this, by, developing, contradictions, in, each, of, the, three, metaphysical, disciplines, that, he, contends, are, in, fact, pseudosciences, this, section, of, the, critique, is, long, and, kant, s, arguments, are, extremely, detailed, in, this, context, it, not, possible, to, do, much, more, than, enumerate, the, topics, of, discussion, the, first, chapter, addresses, what, kant, terms, the, paralogisms, i, e, false, inferences, that, pure, reason, makes, in, the, metaphysical, discipline, of, rational, psychology, he, argues, that, one, cannot, take, the, mere, thought, of, i, in, the, proposition, i, think, as, the, proper, cognition, of, i, as, an, object, in, this, way, he, claims, to, debunk, various, metaphysical, theses, about, the, substantiality, unity, and, self, identity, of, the, soul, the, second, chapter, which, is, the, longest, takes, up, the, topic, kant, calls, the, antinomies, of, pure, reason, that, is, the, contradictions, of, reason, with, itself, in, the, metaphysical, discipline, of, rational, cosmology, originally, kant, had, thought, that, all, transcendental, illusion, could, be, analyzed, in, antinomic, terms, he, presents, four, cases, in, which, he, claims, reason, is, able, to, prove, opposing, theses, with, equal, plausibility, kant, further, argues, in, each, case, that, his, doctrine, of, transcendental, idealism, is, able, to, resolve, the, antinomy, the, third, chapter, examines, fallacious, arguments, about, god, in, rational, theology, under, the, heading, of, the, ideal, of, pure, reason, whereas, an, idea, is, a, pure, concept, generated, by, reason, an, ideal, is, the, concept, of, an, idea, as, an, individual, thing, here, kant, addresses, and, claims, to, refute, three, traditional, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, the, ontological, argument, the, cosmological, argument, and, the, physio, theological, argument, i, e, the, argument, from, design, the, results, of, the, transcendental, dialectic, so, far, appear, to, be, entirely, negative, in, an, appendix, to, this, section, kant, rejects, such, a, conclusion, the, ideas, of, pure, reason, he, argues, have, an, important, regulatory, function, in, directing, and, organizing, our, theoretical, and, practical, inquiry, kant, s, later, works, elaborate, upon, this, function, at, length, and, in, detail, kant, developed, his, ethics, or, moral, philosophy, in, three, works, groundwork, of, the, metaphysics, of, morals, 1785, critique, of, practical, reason, 1788, and, metaphysics, of, morals, 1797, with, regard, to, morality, kant, argued, that, the, source, of, the, good, lies, not, in, anything, outside, the, human, subject, either, in, nature, or, given, by, god, but, rather, is, only, the, good, will, itself, a, good, will, is, one, that, acts, from, duty, in, accordance, with, the, universal, moral, law, that, the, autonomous, human, being, freely, gives, itself, this, law, obliges, one, to, treat, humanity, understood, as, rational, agency, and, represented, through, oneself, as, well, as, others, as, an, end, in, itself, rather, than, merely, as, means, to, other, ends, the, individual, might, hold, kant, is, known, for, his, theory, that, all, moral, obligation, is, grounded, in, what, he, calls, the, categorical, imperative, which, is, derived, from, the, concept, of, duty, he, argues, that, the, moral, law, is, a, principle, of, reason, itself, not, based, on, contingent, facts, about, the, world, such, as, what, would, make, us, happy, to, act, on, the, moral, law, has, no, other, motive, than, worthiness, to, be, happy, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, distinguishes, between, the, transcendental, idea, of, freedom, which, as, a, psychological, concept, is, mainly, empirical, and, refers, to, whether, a, faculty, of, beginning, a, series, of, successive, things, or, states, from, itself, is, to, be, assumed, and, the, practical, concept, of, freedom, as, the, independence, of, our, will, from, the, coercion, or, necessitation, through, sensuous, impulses, kant, finds, it, a, source, of, difficulty, that, the, practical, idea, of, freedom, is, founded, on, the, transcendental, idea, of, freedom, but, for, the, sake, of, practical, interests, uses, the, practical, meaning, taking, no, account, of, its, transcendental, meaning, which, he, feels, was, properly, disposed, of, in, the, third, antinomy, and, as, an, element, in, the, question, of, the, freedom, of, the, will, is, for, philosophy, a, real, stumbling, block, that, has, embarrassed, speculative, reason, kant, calls, practical, everything, that, is, possible, through, freedom, he, calls, the, pure, practical, laws, that, are, never, given, through, sensuous, conditions, but, are, held, analogously, with, the, universal, law, of, causality, moral, laws, reason, can, give, us, only, the, pragmatic, laws, of, free, action, through, the, senses, but, pure, practical, laws, given, by, reason, a, priori, dictate, what, is, to, be, done, kant, s, categories, of, freedom, function, primarily, as, conditions, for, the, possibility, for, actions, i, to, be, free, ii, to, be, understood, as, free, and, iii, to, be, morally, evaluated, for, kant, although, actions, as, theoretical, objects, are, constituted, by, means, of, the, theoretical, categories, actions, as, practical, objects, objects, of, practical, use, of, reason, and, which, can, be, good, or, bad, are, constituted, by, means, of, the, categories, of, freedom, only, in, this, way, can, actions, as, phenomena, be, a, consequence, of, freedom, and, be, understood, and, evaluated, as, such, kant, makes, a, distinction, between, categorical, and, hypothetical, imperatives, a, hypothetical, imperative, is, one, that, we, must, obey, to, satisfy, contingent, desires, a, categorical, imperative, binds, us, regardless, of, our, desires, for, example, everyone, has, a, duty, to, respect, others, as, individual, ends, in, themselves, regardless, of, circumstances, even, though, it, is, sometimes, in, our, narrowly, selfish, interest, to, not, do, so, these, imperatives, are, morally, binding, because, of, the, categorical, form, of, their, maxims, rather, than, contingent, facts, about, an, agent, unlike, hypothetical, imperatives, which, bind, us, insofar, as, we, are, part, of, a, group, or, society, which, we, owe, duties, to, we, cannot, opt, out, of, the, categorical, imperative, because, we, cannot, opt, out, of, being, rational, agents, we, owe, a, duty, to, rationality, by, virtue, of, being, rational, agents, therefore, rational, moral, principles, apply, to, all, rational, agents, at, all, times, stated, in, other, terms, with, all, forms, of, instrumental, rationality, excluded, from, morality, the, moral, law, itself, kant, holds, can, only, be, the, form, of, lawfulness, itself, because, nothing, else, is, left, once, all, content, has, been, rejected, kant, provides, three, formulations, for, the, categorical, imperative, he, claims, that, these, are, necessarily, equivalent, as, all, being, expressions, of, the, pure, universality, of, the, moral, law, as, such, many, scholars, are, not, convinced, the, formulas, are, as, follows, kant, defines, maxim, as, a, subjective, principle, of, volition, which, is, distinguished, from, an, objective, principle, or, practical, law, while, the, latter, is, valid, for, every, rational, being, and, is, a, principle, according, to, which, they, ought, to, act, a, maxim, contains, the, practical, rule, which, reason, determines, in, accordance, with, the, conditions, of, the, subject, often, their, ignorance, or, inclinations, and, is, thus, the, principle, according, to, which, the, subject, does, act, maxims, fail, to, qualify, as, practical, laws, if, they, produce, a, contradiction, in, conception, or, a, contradiction, in, the, will, when, universalized, a, contradiction, in, conception, happens, when, if, a, maxim, were, to, be, universalized, it, ceases, to, make, sense, because, the, maxim, would, necessarily, destroy, itself, as, soon, as, it, was, made, a, universal, law, for, example, if, the, maxim, it, is, permissible, to, break, promises, was, universalized, no, one, would, trust, any, promises, made, so, the, idea, of, a, promise, would, become, meaningless, the, maxim, would, be, self, contradictory, because, when, it, is, universalized, promises, cease, to, be, meaningful, the, maxim, is, not, moral, because, it, is, logically, impossible, to, universalize, that, is, we, could, not, conceive, of, a, world, where, this, maxim, was, universalized, a, maxim, can, also, be, immoral, if, it, creates, a, contradiction, in, the, will, when, universalized, this, does, not, mean, a, logical, contradiction, but, that, universalizing, the, maxim, leads, to, a, state, of, affairs, that, no, rational, being, would, desire, as, kant, explains, in, the, 1785, groundwork, of, the, metaphysics, of, morals, and, as, its, title, directly, indicates, that, text, is, nothing, more, than, the, search, for, and, establishment, of, the, supreme, principle, of, morality, his, promised, metaphysics, of, morals, was, much, delayed, and, did, not, appear, until, its, two, parts, the, doctrine, of, right, and, the, doctrine, of, virtue, were, published, separately, in, 1797, and, 1798, the, first, deals, with, political, philosophy, the, second, with, ethics, the, doctrine, of, virtue, provides, a, very, different, account, of, ordinary, moral, reasoning, than, the, one, suggested, by, the, groundwork, it, is, concerned, with, duties, of, virtue, or, ends, that, are, at, the, same, time, duties, it, is, here, in, the, domain, of, ethics, that, the, greatest, innovation, by, the, metaphysics, of, morals, is, to, be, found, according, to, kant, s, account, ordinary, moral, reasoning, is, fundamentally, teleological, it, is, reasoning, about, what, ends, we, are, constrained, by, morality, to, pursue, and, the, priorities, among, these, ends, we, are, required, to, observe, there, are, two, sorts, of, ends, that, it, is, our, duty, to, have, our, own, perfection, and, the, happiness, of, others, ms, 6, 385, perfection, includes, both, our, natural, perfection, the, development, of, our, talents, skills, and, capacities, of, understanding, and, moral, perfection, our, virtuous, disposition, ms, 6, 387, a, person, s, happiness, is, the, greatest, rational, whole, of, the, ends, the, person, set, for, the, sake, of, her, own, satisfaction, ms, 6, 387, 388, kant, s, elaboration, of, this, teleological, doctrine, offers, up, a, moral, theory, very, different, from, the, one, typically, attributed, to, him, on, the, basis, of, his, foundational, works, alone, in, towards, perpetual, peace, a, philosophical, project, kant, listed, several, conditions, that, he, thought, necessary, for, ending, wars, and, creating, a, lasting, peace, they, included, a, world, of, constitutional, republics, his, classical, republican, theory, was, extended, in, the, doctrine, of, right, the, first, part, of, the, metaphysics, of, morals, 1797, kant, believed, that, universal, history, leads, to, the, ultimate, world, of, republican, states, at, peace, but, his, theory, was, not, pragmatic, the, process, was, described, in, perpetual, peace, as, natural, rather, than, rational, what, affords, this, guarantee, surety, is, nothing, less, than, the, great, artist, nature, natura, daedala, rerum, from, whose, mechanical, course, purposiveness, shines, forth, visibly, letting, concord, arise, by, means, of, the, discord, between, human, beings, even, against, their, will, and, for, this, reason, nature, regarded, as, necessitation, by, a, cause, the, laws, of, whose, operation, are, unknown, to, us, is, called, fate, but, if, we, consider, its, purposiveness, in, the, course, of, the, world, as, the, profound, wisdom, of, a, higher, cause, directed, to, the, objective, final, end, of, the, human, race, and, predetermining, this, course, of, the, world, it, is, called, providence, kant, s, political, thought, can, be, summarized, as, republican, government, and, international, organization, in, more, characteristically, kantian, terms, it, is, doctrine, of, the, state, based, upon, the, law, rechtsstaat, and, of, eternal, peace, indeed, in, each, of, these, formulations, both, terms, express, the, same, idea, that, of, legal, constitution, or, of, peace, through, law, kant, s, political, philosophy, being, essentially, a, legal, doctrine, rejects, by, definition, the, opposition, between, moral, education, and, the, play, of, passions, as, alternate, foundations, for, social, life, the, state, is, defined, as, the, union, of, men, under, law, the, state, rightly, so, called, is, constituted, by, laws, which, are, necessary, a, priori, because, they, flow, from, the, very, concept, of, law, a, regime, can, be, judged, by, no, other, criteria, nor, be, assigned, any, other, functions, than, those, proper, to, the, lawful, order, as, such, kant, opposed, democracy, which, at, his, time, meant, direct, democracy, believing, that, majority, rule, posed, a, threat, to, individual, liberty, he, stated, that, democracy, in, the, strict, sense, of, the, word, is, necessarily, a, despotism, because, it, establishes, an, executive, power, in, which, all, decide, for, and, if, need, be, against, one, who, thus, does, not, agree, so, that, all, who, are, nevertheless, not, all, decide, and, this, is, a, contradiction, of, the, general, will, with, itself, and, with, freedom, as, with, most, writers, at, the, time, kant, distinguished, three, forms, of, government, namely, democracy, aristocracy, and, monarchy, with, mixed, government, as, the, most, ideal, form, of, it, he, believed, in, republican, ideals, and, forms, of, governance, and, rule, of, law, brought, on, by, them, although, kant, published, this, as, a, popular, piece, mary, j, gregor, points, out, that, two, years, later, in, the, metaphysics, of, morals, kant, claims, to, demonstrate, systematically, that, establishing, universal, and, lasting, peace, constitutes, not, merely, a, part, of, the, doctrine, of, right, but, rather, the, entire, final, end, of, the, doctrine, of, right, within, the, limits, of, mere, reason, the, doctrine, of, right, published, in, 1797, contains, kant, s, most, mature, and, systematic, contribution, to, political, philosophy, it, addresses, duties, according, to, law, which, are, concerned, only, with, protecting, the, external, freedom, of, individuals, and, indifferent, to, incentives, although, there, is, a, moral, duty, to, limit, ourselves, to, actions, that, are, right, that, duty, is, not, part, of, itself, its, basic, political, idea, is, that, each, person, s, entitlement, to, be, his, or, her, own, master, is, only, consistent, with, the, entitlements, of, others, if, public, legal, institutions, are, in, place, he, formulates, a, universal, principle, of, right, as, any, action, is, right, if, it, can, coexist, with, everyone, s, freedom, in, accordance, with, a, universal, law, or, if, on, its, maxim, the, freedom, of, choice, of, each, can, coexist, with, everyone, s, freedom, in, accordance, with, a, universal, law, ms, 6, 230, starting, in, the, 20th, century, commentators, tended, to, see, kant, as, having, a, strained, relationship, with, religion, although, in, the, nineteenth, century, this, had, not, been, the, prevalent, view, karl, leonhard, reinhold, whose, letters, helped, make, kant, famous, wrote, i, believe, that, i, may, infer, without, reservation, that, the, interest, of, religion, and, of, christianity, in, particular, accords, completely, with, the, result, of, the, critique, of, reason, according, to, johann, schultz, who, wrote, one, of, the, first, commentaries, on, kant, and, does, not, this, system, itself, cohere, most, splendidly, with, the, christian, religion, do, not, the, divinity, and, beneficence, of, the, latter, become, all, the, more, evident, the, reason, for, these, views, was, kant, s, moral, theology, and, the, widespread, belief, that, his, philosophy, was, the, great, antithesis, to, spinozism, which, was, widely, seen, as, a, form, of, sophisticated, pantheism, or, even, atheism, as, kant, s, philosophy, disregarded, the, possibility, of, arguing, for, god, through, pure, reason, alone, for, the, same, reasons, it, also, disregarded, the, possibility, of, arguing, against, god, through, pure, reason, alone, kant, articulates, his, strongest, criticisms, of, the, organization, and, practices, of, religious, organizations, to, those, that, encourage, what, he, sees, as, a, religion, of, counterfeit, service, to, god, among, the, major, targets, of, his, criticism, are, external, ritual, superstition, and, a, hierarchical, church, order, he, sees, these, as, efforts, to, make, oneself, pleasing, to, god, in, ways, other, than, conscientious, adherence, to, the, principle, of, moral, rightness, in, choosing, and, acting, upon, one, s, maxims, kant, s, criticisms, on, these, matters, along, with, his, rejection, of, certain, theoretical, proofs, for, the, existence, of, god, that, were, grounded, in, pure, reason, particularly, the, ontological, argument, and, his, philosophical, commentary, on, some, christian, doctrines, have, resulted, in, interpretations, that, see, kant, as, hostile, to, religion, in, general, and, to, christianity, in, particular, other, interpreters, nevertheless, consider, that, kant, was, trying, to, mark, off, defensible, from, indefensible, christian, belief, regarding, kant, s, conception, of, religion, some, critics, have, argued, that, he, was, sympathetic, to, deism, other, critics, have, argued, that, kant, s, moral, conception, moves, from, deism, to, theism, as, moral, theism, for, example, allen, w, wood, as, well, as, merold, westphal, as, for, kant, s, book, religion, within, the, bounds, of, mere, reason, it, was, emphasized, that, kant, reduced, religiosity, to, rationality, religion, to, morality, and, christianity, to, ethics, however, many, interpreters, including, wood, alongside, lawrence, pasternack, now, agree, with, stephen, palmquist, s, claim, that, a, better, way, of, reading, kant, s, religion, is, to, see, him, as, raising, morality, to, the, status, of, religion, kant, discusses, the, subjective, nature, of, aesthetic, qualities, and, experiences, in, observations, on, the, feeling, of, the, beautiful, and, sublime, 1764, kant, s, contribution, to, aesthetic, theory, is, developed, in, the, critique, of, the, power, of, judgment, 1790, where, he, investigates, the, possibility, and, logical, status, of, judgments, of, taste, in, the, critique, of, aesthetic, judgment, the, first, major, division, of, the, critique, of, the, power, of, judgment, kant, used, the, term, aesthetic, in, a, manner, that, differs, from, its, modern, sense, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, to, note, essential, differences, between, judgments, of, taste, moral, judgments, and, scientific, judgments, kant, abandoned, the, term, aesthetic, as, designating, the, critique, of, taste, noting, that, judgments, of, taste, could, never, be, directed, by, laws, a, priori, after, a, g, baumgarten, who, wrote, aesthetica, 1750, 58, kant, was, one, of, the, first, philosophers, to, develop, and, integrate, aesthetic, theory, into, a, unified, and, comprehensive, philosophical, system, utilizing, ideas, that, played, an, integral, role, throughout, his, philosophy, in, the, chapter, analytic, of, the, beautiful, in, the, critique, of, the, power, of, judgment, kant, states, that, beauty, is, not, a, property, of, an, artwork, or, natural, phenomenon, but, is, instead, consciousness, of, the, pleasure, that, attends, the, free, play, of, the, imagination, and, the, understanding, even, though, it, appears, that, we, are, using, reason, to, decide, what, is, beautiful, the, judgment, is, not, a, cognitive, judgment, and, is, consequently, not, logical, but, aesthetical, a, pure, judgement, of, taste, is, subjective, since, it, refers, to, the, emotional, response, of, the, subject, and, is, based, upon, nothing, but, esteem, for, an, object, itself, it, is, a, disinterested, pleasure, and, we, feel, that, pure, judgements, of, taste, i, e, judgements, of, beauty, lay, claim, to, universal, validity, this, universal, validity, is, not, derived, from, a, determinate, concept, of, beauty, but, from, common, sense, kant, also, believed, that, a, judgment, of, taste, shares, characteristics, with, a, moral, judgment, both, are, disinterested, and, we, hold, them, to, be, universal, in, the, chapter, analytic, of, the, sublime, kant, identifies, the, sublime, as, an, aesthetic, quality, that, like, beauty, is, subjective, but, unlike, beauty, it, refers, to, an, indeterminate, relationship, between, the, faculties, of, the, imagination, and, reason, it, also, shares, the, character, of, moral, judgments, in, its, engagement, with, reason, the, feeling, of, the, sublime, divided, into, two, distinct, modes, the, mathematical, and, the, dynamical, sublime, describes, two, subjective, moments, that, concern, the, relationship, of, the, faculty, of, the, imagination, to, reason, some, commentators, argue, that, kant, s, critical, philosophy, contains, a, third, kind, of, the, sublime, the, moral, sublime, which, is, the, aesthetic, response, to, the, moral, law, or, a, representation, and, a, development, of, the, noble, sublime, in, kant, s, theory, of, 1764, the, mathematical, sublime, results, from, the, failure, of, the, imagination, to, comprehend, natural, objects, that, appear, boundless, and, formless, or, appear, absolutely, great, this, imaginative, failure, is, then, recuperated, through, the, pleasure, taken, in, reason, s, assertion, of, the, concept, of, infinity, in, this, move, the, faculty, of, reason, proves, itself, superior, to, our, fallible, sensible, self, in, the, dynamical, sublime, there, is, the, sense, of, annihilation, of, the, sensible, self, as, the, imagination, tries, to, comprehend, a, vast, might, this, power, of, nature, threatens, us, but, through, the, resistance, of, reason, to, such, sensible, annihilation, the, subject, feels, a, pleasure, and, a, sense, of, the, human, moral, vocation, this, appreciation, of, moral, feeling, through, exposure, to, the, sublime, helps, to, develop, moral, character, kant, developed, a, theory, of, humor, which, has, been, interpreted, as, an, incongruity, theory, he, illustrated, his, theory, of, humor, by, telling, three, narrative, jokes, in, the, critique, of, judgment, he, thought, that, the, physiological, impact, of, humor, is, akin, to, that, of, music, kant, developed, a, distinction, between, an, object, of, art, as, a, material, value, subject, to, the, conventions, of, society, and, the, transcendental, condition, of, the, judgment, of, taste, as, a, refined, value, in, his, idea, for, a, universal, history, with, a, cosmopolitan, aim, 1784, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, theses, of, that, work, he, identified, all, art, as, the, fruits, of, unsociableness, due, to, men, s, antagonism, in, society, and, in, the, seventh, thesis, asserted, that, while, such, material, property, is, indicative, of, a, civilized, state, only, the, ideal, of, morality, and, the, universalization, of, refined, value, through, the, improvement, of, the, mind, belongs, to, culture, kant, lectured, on, anthropology, the, study, of, human, nature, for, twenty, three, years, his, anthropology, from, a, pragmatic, point, of, view, was, published, in, 1798, transcripts, of, kant, s, lectures, on, anthropology, were, published, for, the, first, time, in, 1997, in, german, kant, was, among, the, first, people, of, his, time, to, introduce, anthropology, as, an, intellectual, area, of, study, long, before, the, field, gained, popularity, and, his, texts, are, considered, to, have, advanced, the, field, his, point, of, view, was, to, influence, the, works, of, later, philosophers, such, as, martin, heidegger, and, paul, ricoeur, kant, was, the, first, to, suggest, using, a, dimensionality, approach, to, human, diversity, he, analyzed, the, nature, of, the, hippocrates, galen, four, temperaments, and, plotted, in, two, dimensions, what, belongs, to, a, human, being, s, faculty, of, desire, his, natural, aptitude, or, natural, predisposition, and, his, temperament, or, sensibility, cholerics, were, described, as, emotional, and, energetic, phlegmatics, as, balanced, and, weak, sanguines, as, balanced, and, energetic, and, melancholics, as, emotional, and, weak, these, two, dimensions, reappeared, in, all, subsequent, models, of, temperament, and, personality, traits, kant, viewed, anthropology, in, two, broad, categories, 1, the, physiological, approach, which, he, referred, to, as, what, nature, makes, of, the, human, being, and, 2, the, pragmatic, approach, which, explores, the, things, that, a, human, can, and, should, make, of, himself, kant, s, theory, of, race, and, his, prejudicial, beliefs, are, among, the, most, contentious, areas, of, recent, kant, scholarship, while, few, if, any, dispute, the, overt, racism, and, chauvinism, present, in, his, work, a, more, contested, question, is, the, degree, to, which, it, degrades, or, invalidates, his, other, contributions, his, most, severe, critics, assert, that, kant, intentionally, manipulated, science, to, support, chattel, slavery, and, discrimination, others, acknowledge, that, he, lived, in, an, era, of, immature, science, with, many, erroneous, beliefs, some, racist, all, appearing, decades, before, evolution, molecular, genetics, and, other, sciences, that, today, are, taken, for, granted, kant, was, one, of, the, most, notable, enlightenment, thinkers, to, defend, racism, philosopher, charles, w, mills, is, unequivocal, kant, is, also, seen, as, one, of, the, central, figures, in, the, birth, of, modern, scientific, racism, whereas, other, contributors, to, early, racial, thought, like, carolus, linnaeus, and, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, had, offered, only, empirical, scare, quotes, necessary, observation, kant, produced, a, full, blown, theory, of, race, using, the, four, temperaments, of, ancient, greece, kant, proposed, a, hierarchy, of, racial, categories, including, white, europeans, black, africans, and, red, native, americans, although, he, was, a, proponent, of, scientific, racism, for, much, of, his, career, kant, s, views, on, race, changed, significantly, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, and, he, ultimately, rejected, racial, hierarchies, and, european, colonialism, in, perpetual, peace, a, philosophical, sketch, 1795, kant, was, an, opponent, of, miscegenation, believing, that, whites, would, be, degraded, and, that, fusing, of, races, is, undesirable, for, not, every, race, adopts, the, morals, and, customs, of, the, europeans, he, states, that, instead, of, assimilation, which, was, intended, by, the, melting, together, of, the, various, races, nature, has, here, made, a, law, of, just, the, opposite, kant, was, also, an, anti, semite, believing, that, jews, were, incapable, of, transcending, material, forces, which, a, moral, order, required, in, this, way, jews, are, presented, as, the, opposite, of, autonomous, rational, christians, and, therefore, incapable, of, being, incorporated, into, an, ethical, christian, society, in, his, anthropology, kant, called, the, jews, a, nation, of, cheaters, and, portrayed, them, as, a, group, that, has, followed, not, the, path, of, transcendental, freedom, but, that, of, enslavement, to, the, material, world, mills, wrote, that, kant, has, been, sanitized, for, public, consumption, his, racist, works, conveniently, ignored, robert, bernasconi, stated, that, kant, supplied, the, first, scientific, definition, of, race, emmanuel, chukwudi, eze, is, credited, with, bringing, kant, s, contributions, to, racism, to, light, in, the, 1990s, among, western, philosophers, who, he, believed, often, glossed, over, this, part, of, his, life, and, works, pauline, kleingeld, argues, that, while, kant, did, defend, a, racial, hierarchy, until, at, least, the, end, of, the, 1780s, his, views, on, race, changed, significantly, in, works, published, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, in, particular, she, argues, that, kant, rejected, past, views, related, to, racial, hierarchies, and, the, diminished, rights, or, moral, status, of, non, whites, in, perpetual, peace, 1795, this, work, also, saw, him, providing, extended, arguments, against, european, colonialism, which, he, claimed, was, morally, unjust, and, incompatible, with, the, equal, rights, held, by, indigenous, populations, kleingeld, argues, that, this, shift, in, kant, s, views, later, in, life, has, often, been, forgotten, or, ignored, in, the, literature, on, kant, s, racist, anthropology, and, that, the, shift, suggests, a, belated, recognition, of, the, fact, that, racial, hierarchy, was, incompatible, with, a, universalized, moral, framework, while, kant, s, racist, rhetoric, is, indicative, of, the, state, of, scholarship, and, science, during, the, 18th, century, german, philosopher, daniel, pascal, zorn, explains, the, risk, of, taking, period, quotations, out, of, context, many, of, kant, s, most, outrageous, quotations, are, from, a, series, of, articles, from, 1777, 1788, a, public, exchange, among, kant, herder, natural, scientist, georg, forster, and, other, scholars, prominent, in, that, period, kant, asserts, that, all, races, of, humankind, are, of, the, same, species, challenging, the, position, of, forster, and, others, that, the, races, were, distinct, species, while, his, commentary, is, clearly, biased, at, times, certain, extreme, statements, were, patterned, specifically, to, paraphrase, or, counter, forster, and, other, authors, by, considering, the, full, arc, of, kant, s, scholarship, zorn, notes, the, progression, in, both, his, philosophical, and, his, anthropological, works, with, which, he, argues, against, the, zeitgeist, for, the, unity, of, humanity, kant, s, influence, on, western, thought, has, been, profound, although, the, basic, tenets, of, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, i, e, that, space, and, time, are, a, priori, forms, of, human, perception, rather, than, real, properties, and, the, claim, that, formal, logic, and, transcendental, logic, coincide, have, been, claimed, to, be, falsified, by, modern, science, and, logic, and, no, longer, set, the, intellectual, agenda, of, contemporary, philosophers, kant, is, credited, with, having, innovated, the, way, philosophical, inquiry, has, been, carried, on, at, least, up, to, the, early, nineteenth, century, this, shift, consisted, of, several, closely, related, innovations, that, although, highly, contentious, in, themselves, have, become, important, in, subsequent, philosophy, and, in, the, social, sciences, broadly, construed, kant, s, ideas, have, been, incorporated, into, a, variety, of, schools, of, thought, these, include, german, idealism, marxism, positivism, phenomenology, existentialism, critical, theory, linguistic, philosophy, structuralism, post, structuralism, and, deconstruction, during, his, own, life, much, critical, attention, was, paid, to, kant, s, thought, he, influenced, reinhold, fichte, schelling, hegel, and, novalis, during, the, 1780s, and, 1790s, samuel, taylor, coleridge, was, greatly, influenced, by, kant, and, helped, to, spread, awareness, of, him, and, of, german, idealism, generally, in, the, uk, and, the, us, in, his, biographia, literaria, 1817, he, credits, kant, s, ideas, in, coming, to, believe, that, the, mind, is, not, a, passive, but, an, active, agent, in, the, apprehension, of, reality, hegel, was, one, of, kant, s, first, major, critics, in, hegel, s, view, the, entire, project, of, setting, a, transcendental, subject, i, e, human, consciousness, apart, from, the, living, individual, as, well, as, from, nature, history, and, society, was, fundamentally, flawed, although, parts, of, that, very, project, could, be, put, to, good, use, in, a, new, direction, similar, concerns, motivated, hegel, s, criticisms, of, kant, s, concept, of, moral, autonomy, to, which, hegel, opposed, an, ethic, focused, on, the, ethical, life, of, the, community, in, a, sense, hegel, s, notion, of, ethical, life, is, meant, to, subsume, rather, than, replace, kantian, ethics, and, hegel, can, be, seen, as, trying, to, defend, kant, s, idea, of, freedom, as, going, beyond, finite, desires, by, means, of, reason, thus, in, contrast, to, later, critics, like, nietzsche, or, russell, hegel, shares, some, of, kant, s, concerns, kant, s, thinking, on, religion, was, used, in, britain, by, philosophers, such, as, thomas, carlyle, to, challenge, the, nineteenth, century, decline, in, religious, faith, british, catholic, writers, notably, g, k, chesterton, and, hilaire, belloc, followed, this, approach, criticisms, of, kant, were, common, in, the, realist, views, of, the, new, positivism, at, that, time, arthur, schopenhauer, was, strongly, influenced, by, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, like, g, e, schulze, jacobi, and, fichte, before, him, schopenhauer, was, critical, of, kant, s, theory, of, the, thing, in, itself, things, in, themselves, they, argued, are, neither, the, cause, of, what, we, observe, nor, are, they, completely, beyond, our, access, ever, since, the, critique, of, pure, reason, philosophers, have, been, critical, of, kant, s, theory, of, the, thing, in, itself, many, have, argued, that, if, such, a, thing, exists, beyond, experience, then, one, cannot, posit, that, it, affects, us, causally, since, that, would, entail, stretching, the, category, causality, beyond, the, realm, of, experience, with, the, success, and, wide, influence, of, hegel, s, writings, kant, s, own, influence, began, to, wane, but, a, re, examination, of, his, ideas, began, in, germany, in, 1865, with, the, publication, of, kant, und, die, epigonen, by, otto, liebmann, whose, motto, was, back, to, kant, there, proceeded, an, important, revival, of, kant, s, theoretical, philosophy, known, as, neo, kantianism, kant, s, notion, of, critique, has, been, more, broadly, influential, the, early, german, romantics, especially, friedrich, schlegel, in, his, athenaeum, fragments, used, kant, s, reflexive, conception, of, criticism, in, their, romantic, theory, of, poetry, also, in, aesthetics, clement, greenberg, in, his, classic, essay, modernist, painting, uses, kantian, criticism, what, greenberg, refers, to, as, immanent, criticism, to, justify, the, aims, of, abstract, painting, a, movement, greenberg, saw, as, aware, of, the, key, limitation, flatness, that, makes, up, the, medium, of, painting, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, was, also, greatly, influenced, by, kant, s, notion, of, critique, and, wrote, several, pieces, on, kant, for, a, re, thinking, of, the, enlightenment, as, a, form, of, critical, thought, he, went, so, far, as, to, classify, his, own, philosophy, as, a, critical, history, of, modernity, rooted, in, kant, kant, believed, that, mathematical, truths, were, forms, of, synthetic, a, priori, knowledge, which, means, they, are, necessary, and, universal, yet, known, through, the, a, priori, intuition, of, space, and, time, as, transcendental, preconditions, of, experience, kant, s, often, brief, remarks, about, mathematics, influenced, the, mathematical, school, known, as, intuitionism, a, movement, in, philosophy, of, mathematics, opposed, to, hilbert, s, formalism, and, frege, and, bertrand, russell, s, logicism, with, his, perpetual, peace, kant, is, considered, to, have, foreshadowed, many, of, the, ideas, that, have, come, to, form, the, democratic, peace, theory, one, of, the, main, controversies, in, political, science, more, concretely, constructivist, theorist, alexander, wendt, proposed, that, the, anarchy, of, the, international, system, could, evolve, from, the, brutish, hobbesian, anarchy, understood, by, realist, theorists, through, lockean, anarchy, and, ultimately, a, kantian, anarchy, in, which, states, would, see, their, self, interests, as, inextricably, linked, to, the, well, being, of, other, states, thus, transforming, international, politics, into, a, far, more, peaceful, form, prominent, recent, kantians, include, the, british, philosophers, p, f, strawson, onora, o, neill, and, quassim, cassam, and, the, american, philosophers, wilfrid, sellars, and, christine, korsgaard, due, to, the, influence, of, strawson, and, sellars, among, others, there, has, been, a, renewed, interest, in, kant, s, view, of, the, mind, central, to, many, debates, in, philosophy, of, psychology, and, cognitive, science, is, kant, s, conception,
