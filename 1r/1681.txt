irving, langmuir, l, m, j, r, january, 31, 1881, august, 16, 1957, was, an, american, chemist, physicist, and, engineer, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1932, for, his, work, in, surface, chemistry, langmuir, s, most, famous, publication, is, the, 1919, article, the, arrangement, of, electrons, in, atoms, and, molecules, in, which, building, on, gilbert, n, lewis, s, cubical, atom, theory, and, walther, kossel, s, chemical, bonding, theory, he, outlined, his, concentric, theory, of, atomic, structure, langmuir, became, embroiled, in, a, priority, dispute, with, lewis, over, this, work, langmuir, s, presentation, skills, were, largely, responsible, for, the, popularization, of, the, theory, although, the, credit, for, the, theory, itself, belongs, mostly, to, lewis, while, at, general, electric, from, 1909, to, 1950, langmuir, advanced, several, fields, of, physics, and, chemistry, inventing, the, gas, filled, incandescent, lamp, and, the, hydrogen, welding, technique, the, langmuir, laboratory, for, atmospheric, research, near, socorro, new, mexico, was, named, in, his, honor, as, was, the, american, chemical, society, journal, for, surface, science, called, langmuir, irving, langmuir, was, born, in, brooklyn, new, york, on, january, 31, 1881, he, was, the, third, of, the, four, children, of, charles, langmuir, and, sadie, n, e, comings, during, his, childhood, langmuir, s, parents, encouraged, him, to, carefully, observe, nature, and, to, keep, a, detailed, record, of, his, various, observations, when, irving, was, eleven, it, was, discovered, that, he, had, poor, eyesight, when, this, problem, was, corrected, details, that, had, previously, eluded, him, were, revealed, and, his, interest, in, the, complications, of, nature, was, heightened, during, his, childhood, langmuir, was, influenced, by, his, older, brother, arthur, langmuir, arthur, was, a, research, chemist, who, encouraged, irving, to, be, curious, about, nature, and, how, things, work, arthur, helped, irving, set, up, his, first, chemistry, lab, in, the, corner, of, his, bedroom, and, he, was, content, to, answer, the, myriad, questions, that, irving, would, pose, langmuir, s, hobbies, included, mountaineering, skiing, piloting, his, own, plane, and, classical, music, in, addition, to, his, professional, interest, in, the, politics, of, atomic, energy, he, was, concerned, about, wilderness, conservation, langmuir, attended, several, schools, and, institutes, in, america, and, paris, 1892, 1895, before, graduating, high, school, from, chestnut, hill, academy, 1898, an, elite, private, school, located, in, the, affluent, chestnut, hill, area, in, philadelphia, he, graduated, with, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, metallurgical, engineering, met, e, from, the, columbia, university, school, of, mines, in, 1903, he, earned, his, phd, in, 1906, under, friedrich, dolezalek, in, g, ttingen, for, research, done, using, the, nernst, glower, an, electric, lamp, invented, by, nernst, his, doctoral, thesis, was, entitled, on, the, partial, recombination, of, dissolved, gases, during, cooling, german, ueber, partielle, wiedervereinigung, dissociierter, gase, im, verlauf, einer, abk, hlung, he, later, did, postgraduate, work, in, chemistry, langmuir, then, taught, at, stevens, institute, of, technology, in, hoboken, new, jersey, until, 1909, when, he, began, working, at, the, general, electric, research, laboratory, schenectady, new, york, his, initial, contributions, to, science, came, from, his, study, of, light, bulbs, a, continuation, of, his, phd, work, his, first, major, development, was, the, improvement, of, the, diffusion, pump, which, ultimately, led, to, the, invention, of, the, high, vacuum, rectifier, and, amplifier, tubes, a, year, later, he, and, colleague, lewi, tonks, discovered, that, the, lifetime, of, a, tungsten, filament, could, be, greatly, lengthened, by, filling, the, bulb, with, an, inert, gas, such, as, argon, the, critical, factor, overlooked, by, other, researchers, being, the, need, for, extreme, cleanliness, in, all, stages, of, the, process, he, also, discovered, that, twisting, the, filament, into, a, tight, coil, improved, its, efficiency, these, were, important, developments, in, the, history, of, the, incandescent, light, bulb, his, work, in, surface, chemistry, began, at, this, point, when, he, discovered, that, molecular, hydrogen, introduced, into, a, tungsten, filament, bulb, dissociated, into, atomic, hydrogen, and, formed, a, layer, one, atom, thick, on, the, surface, of, the, bulb, his, assistant, in, vacuum, tube, research, was, his, cousin, william, comings, white, as, he, continued, to, study, filaments, in, vacuum, and, different, gas, environments, he, began, to, study, the, emission, of, charged, particles, from, hot, filaments, thermionic, emission, he, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, work, with, plasmas, and, he, was, the, first, to, call, these, ionized, gases, by, that, name, because, they, reminded, him, of, blood, plasma, langmuir, and, tonks, discovered, electron, density, waves, in, plasmas, that, are, now, known, as, langmuir, waves, he, introduced, the, concept, of, electron, temperature, and, in, 1924, invented, the, diagnostic, method, for, measuring, both, temperature, and, density, with, an, electrostatic, probe, now, called, a, langmuir, probe, and, commonly, used, in, plasma, physics, the, current, of, a, biased, probe, tip, is, measured, as, a, function, of, bias, voltage, to, determine, the, local, plasma, temperature, and, density, he, also, discovered, atomic, hydrogen, which, he, put, to, use, by, inventing, the, atomic, hydrogen, welding, process, the, first, plasma, weld, ever, made, plasma, welding, has, since, been, developed, into, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, in, 1917, he, published, a, paper, on, the, chemistry, of, oil, films, that, later, became, the, basis, for, the, award, of, the, 1932, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, langmuir, theorized, that, oils, consisting, of, an, aliphatic, chain, with, a, hydrophilic, end, group, perhaps, an, alcohol, or, acid, were, oriented, as, a, film, one, molecule, thick, upon, the, surface, of, water, with, the, hydrophilic, group, down, in, the, water, and, the, hydrophobic, chains, clumped, together, on, the, surface, the, thickness, of, the, film, could, be, easily, determined, from, the, known, volume, and, area, of, the, oil, which, allowed, investigation, of, the, molecular, configuration, before, spectroscopic, techniques, were, available, following, world, war, i, langmuir, contributed, to, atomic, theory, and, the, understanding, of, atomic, structure, by, defining, the, modern, concept, of, valence, shells, and, isotopes, langmuir, was, president, of, the, institute, of, radio, engineers, in, 1923, based, on, his, work, at, general, electric, john, b, taylor, developed, a, detector, ionizing, beams, of, alkali, metals, called, nowadays, the, langmuir, taylor, detector, in, 1927, he, was, one, of, the, participants, of, the, fifth, solvay, conference, on, physics, that, took, place, at, the, international, solvay, institute, for, physics, in, belgium, he, joined, katharine, b, blodgett, to, study, thin, films, and, surface, adsorption, they, introduced, the, concept, of, a, monolayer, a, layer, of, material, one, molecule, thick, and, the, two, dimensional, physics, which, describe, such, a, surface, in, 1932, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, discoveries, and, investigations, in, surface, chemistry, in, 1938, langmuir, s, scientific, interests, began, to, turn, to, atmospheric, science, and, meteorology, one, of, his, first, ventures, although, tangentially, related, was, a, refutation, of, the, claim, of, entomologist, charles, h, t, townsend, that, the, deer, botfly, flew, at, speeds, of, over, 800, miles, per, hour, langmuir, estimated, the, fly, s, speed, at, 25, miles, per, hour, after, observing, windrows, of, drifting, seaweed, in, the, sargasso, sea, he, discovered, a, wind, driven, surface, circulation, in, the, sea, it, is, now, called, the, langmuir, circulation, during, world, war, ii, langmuir, and, research, associate, vincent, j, schaefer, worked, on, improving, naval, sonar, for, submarine, detection, and, later, to, develop, protective, smoke, screens, and, methods, for, deicing, aircraft, wings, this, research, led, him, to, theorize, and, then, demonstrate, in, the, laboratory, and, in, the, atmosphere, that, the, introduction, of, ice, nuclei, dry, ice, and, silver, iodide, into, a, sufficiently, moist, cloud, of, low, temperature, supercooled, water, could, induce, precipitation, cloud, seeding, though, in, frequent, practice, particularly, in, australia, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, efficiency, of, this, technique, remains, controversial, today, in, 1953, langmuir, coined, the, term, pathological, science, describing, research, conducted, with, accordance, to, the, scientific, method, but, tainted, by, unconscious, bias, or, subjective, effects, this, is, in, contrast, to, pseudoscience, which, has, no, pretense, of, following, the, scientific, method, in, his, original, speech, he, presented, esp, and, flying, saucers, as, examples, of, pathological, science, since, then, the, label, has, been, applied, to, polywater, and, cold, fusion, his, house, in, schenectady, was, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, in, 1976, langmuir, was, married, to, marion, mersereau, 1883, 1971, in, 1912, with, whom, he, adopted, two, children, kenneth, and, barbara, after, a, short, illness, he, died, in, woods, hole, massachusetts, from, a, heart, attack, on, august, 16, 1957, his, obituary, ran, on, the, front, page, of, the, new, york, times, on, his, religious, views, langmuir, was, an, agnostic, according, to, author, kurt, vonnegut, langmuir, was, the, inspiration, for, his, fictional, scientist, dr, felix, hoenikker, in, the, novel, cat, s, cradle, and, the, character, s, invention, of, ice, nine, a, new, phase, of, water, ice, similar, in, name, only, to, ice, ix, langmuir, had, worked, with, vonnegut, s, brother, bernard, vonnegut, at, general, electric, on, seeding, ice, crystals, to, diminish, or, increase, rain, or, storms
