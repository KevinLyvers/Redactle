letter, had, struck, him, like, a, thunderbolt, and, confessed, i, have, written, my, stories, the, way, reporters, write, up, their, notes, about, fires, mechanically, half, consciously, caring, nothing, about, either, the, reader, or, myself, the, admission, may, have, done, chekhov, a, disservice, since, early, manuscripts, reveal, that, he, often, wrote, with, extreme, care, continually, revising, grigorovich, s, advice, nevertheless, inspired, a, more, serious, artistic, ambition, in, the, twenty, six, year, old, in, 1888, with, a, little, string, pulling, by, grigorovich, the, short, story, collection, at, dusk, v, sumerkakh, won, chekhov, the, coveted, pushkin, prize, for, the, best, literary, production, distinguished, by, high, artistic, worth, in, 1887, exhausted, from,

which, he, called, something, rather, odd, and, much, too, original, and, which, was, eventually, published, in, severny, vestnik, the, northern, herald, in, a, narrative, that, drifts, with, the, thought, processes, of, the, characters, chekhov, evokes, a, chaise, journey, across, the, steppe, through, the, eyes, of, a, young, boy, sent, to, live, away, from, home, and, his, companions, a, priest, and, a, merchant, the, steppe, has, been, called, a, dictionary, of, chekhov, s, poetics, and, it, represented, a, significant, advance, for, chekhov, exhibiting, much, of, the, quality, of, his, mature, fiction, and, winning, him, publication, in, a, literary, journal, rather, than, a, newspaper, in, autumn, 1887, a, theatre, manager, named, korsh, commissioned, chekhov, to, write, a, play, the, result, being, ivanov, written, in, a, fortnight, and, produced, that, november, though, chekhov, found, the, experience, sickening, and, painted, a, comic, portrait, of, the, chaotic, production, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, alexander, the, play, was, a, hit, and, was, praised, to, chekhov, s, bemusement, as, a, work, of, originality, although, chekhov, did, not, fully, realise, it, at, the, time, chekhov, s, plays, such, as, the, seagull, written, in, 1895, uncle, vanya, written, in, 1897, the, three, sisters, written, in, 1900, and, the, cherry, orchard, written, in, 1903, served, as, a, revolutionary, backbone, to, what, is, common, sense, to, the, medium, of, acting, to, this, day, an, effort, to, recreate, and, express, the, realism, of, how, people, truly, act, and, speak, with, each, other, this, realistic, manifestation, of, the, human, condition, may, engender, in, audiences, reflection, upon, what, it, means, to, be, human, this, philosophy, of, approaching, the, art, of, acting, has, stood, not, only, steadfast, but, as, the, cornerstone, of, acting, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, to, this, day, mikhail, chekhov, considered, ivanov, a, key, moment, in, his, brother, s, intellectual, development, and, literary, career, from, this, period, comes, an, observation, of, chekhov, s, that, has, become, known, as, chekhov, s, gun, a, dramatic, principle, that, requires, that, every, element, in, a, narrative, be, necessary, and, irreplaceable, and, that, everything, else, be, removed, remove, everything, that, has, no, relevance, to, the, story, if, you, say, in, the, first, chapter, that, there, is, a, rifle, hanging, on, the, wall, in, the, second, or, third, chapter, it, absolutely, must, go, off, if, it, s, not, going, to, be, fired, it, shouldn, t, be, hanging, there, the, death, of, chekhov, s, brother, nikolai, from, tuberculosis, in, 1889, influenced, a, dreary, story, finished, that, september, about, a, man, who, confronts, the, end, of, a, life, that, he, realises, has, been, without, purpose, mikhail, chekhov, recorded, his, brother, s, depression, and, restlessness, after, nikolai, s, death, mikhail, was, researching, prisons, at, that, time, as, part, of, his, law, studies, anton, chekhov, in, a, search, for, purpose, in, his, own, life, himself, soon, became, obsessed, with, the, issue, of, prison, reform, in, 1890, chekhov, undertook, an, arduous, journey, by, train, horse, drawn, carriage, and, river, steamer, to, the, russian, far, east, and, the, katorga, or, penal, colony, on, sakhalin, island, north, of, japan, he, spent, three, months, there, interviewing, thousands, of, convicts, and, settlers, for, a, census, the, letters, chekhov, wrote, during, the, two, and, a, half, month, journey, to, sakhalin, are, considered, to, be, among, his, best, his, remarks, to, his, sister, about, tomsk, were, to, become, notorious, tomsk, is, a, very, dull, town, to, judge, from, the, drunkards, whose, acquaintance, i, have, made, and, from, the, intellectual, people, who, have, come, to, the, hotel, to, pay, their, respects, to, me, the, inhabitants, are, very, dull, too, chekhov, witnessed, much, on, sakhalin, that, shocked, and, angered, him, including, floggings, embezzlement, of, supplies, and, forced, prostitution, of, women, he, wrote, there, were, times, i, felt, that, i, saw, before, me, the, extreme, limits, of, man, s, degradation, he, was, particularly, moved, by, the, plight, of, the, children, living, in, the, penal, colony, with, their, parents, for, example, on, the, amur, steamer, going, to, sakhalin, there, was, a, convict, who, had, murdered, his, wife, and, wore, fetters, on, his, legs, his, daughter, a, little, girl, of, six, was, with, him, i, noticed, wherever, the, convict, moved, the, little, girl, scrambled, after, him, holding, on, to, his, fetters, at, night, the, child, slept, with, the, convicts, and, soldiers, all, in, a, heap, together, chekhov, later, concluded, that, charity, was, not, the, answer, but, that, the, government, had, a, duty, to, finance, humane, treatment, of, the, convicts, his, findings, were, published, in, 1893, and, 1894, as, ostrov, sakhalin, the, island, of, sakhalin, a, work, of, social, science, not, literature, chekhov, found, literary, expression, for, the, hell, of, sakhalin, in, his, long, short, story, the, murder, the, last, section, of, which, is, set, on, sakhalin, where, the, murderer, yakov, loads, coal, in, the, night, while, longing, for, home, chekhov, s, writing, on, sakhalin, especially, the, traditions, and, habits, of, the, gilyak, people, is, the, subject, of, a, sustained, meditation, and, analysis, in, haruki, murakami, s, novel, 1q84, it, is, also, the, subject, of, a, poem, by, the, nobel, prize, winner, seamus, heaney, chekhov, on, sakhalin, collected, in, the, volume, station, island, rebecca, gould, has, compared, chekhov, s, book, on, sakhalin, to,

first, day, that, chekhov, moved, to, melikhovo, the, sick, began, flocking, to, him, from, twenty, miles, around, they, came, on, foot, or, were, brought, in, carts, and, often, he, was, fetched, to, patients, at, a, distance, sometimes, from, early, in, the, morning, peasant, women, and, children, were, standing, before, his, door, waiting, chekhov, s, expenditure, on, drugs, was, considerable, but, the, greatest, cost, was, making, journeys, of, several, hours, to, visit, the, sick, which, reduced, his, time, for, writing, however, chekhov, s, work, as, a, doctor, enriched, his, writing, by, bringing, him, into, intimate, contact, with, all, sections, of, russian, society, for, example, he, witnessed, at, first, hand, the, peasants, unhealthy, and, cramped, living, conditions, which, he, recalled, in, his, short, story, peasants, chekhov, visited, the, upper, classes, as, well, recording, in, his, notebook, aristocrats, the, same, ugly, bodies, and, physical, uncleanliness, the,

looked, after, as, though, they, were, his, children, like, colonel, vershinin, in, his, three, sisters, as, he, looked, at, them, he, dreamed, of, what, they, would, be, like, in, three, or, four, hundred, years, the, first, night, of, the, seagull, at, the, alexandrinsky, theatre, in, st, petersburg, on, 17, october, 1896, was, a, fiasco, as, the, play, was, booed, by, the, audience, stinging, chekhov, into, renouncing, the, theatre, but, the, play, so, impressed, the, theatre, director, vladimir, nemirovich, danchenko, that, he, convinced, his, colleague, konstantin, stanislavski, to, direct, a, new, production, for, the, innovative, moscow, art, theatre, in, 1898, stanislavski, s, attention, to, psychological, realism, and, ensemble, playing, coaxed, the, buried, subtleties, from,

leave, his, hot, siberia, for, moscow, or, travels, abroad, he, vowed, to, move, to, taganrog, as, soon, as, a, water, supply, was, installed, there, in, yalta, he, completed, two, more, plays, for,

danchenko, whom, he, had, first, met, at, rehearsals, for, the, seagull, up, to, that, point, chekhov, known, as, russia, s, most, elusive, literary, bachelor, had, preferred, passing, liaisons, and, visits, to, brothels, over, commitment, he, had, once, written, to, suvorin, by, all, means, i, will, be, married, if, you, wish, it, but, on, these, conditions, everything, must, be, as, it, has, been, hitherto, that, is, she, must, live, in, moscow, while, i, live, in, the, country, and, i, will, come, and, see, her, i, promise, to, be, an, excellent, husband, but, give, me, a, wife, who,

her, acting, career, in, 1902, olga, suffered, a, miscarriage, and, donald, rayfield, has, offered, evidence, based, on, the, couple, s, letters, that, conception, occurred, when, chekhov, and, olga, were, apart, although, other, russian, scholars, have, rejected, that, claim, the, literary, legacy, of, this, long, distance, marriage, is, a, correspondence, that, preserves, gems, of, theatre,

and, end, up, risking, scandal, and, the, security, of, their, family, lives, the, story, masterfully, captures, their, feelings, for, each, other, the, inner, transformation, undergone, by, the, disillusioned, male, protagonist, as, a, result, of, falling, deeply, in, love, and, their, inability, to, resolve, the, matter, by, either, letting, go, of, their, families, or, of, each, other, in,

about, chekhov, s, death, believed, that, chekhov, was, the, greatest, of, all, short, story, writers, chekhov, s, stories, are, as, wonderful, and, necessary, now, as, when, they, first, appeared, it, is, not, only, the, immense, number, of, stories, he, wrote, for, few, if, any, writers, have, ever, done, more, it, is, the, awesome, frequency, with, which, he, produced, masterpieces, stories, that, shrive, us, as, well, as, delight, and, move, us, that, lay, bare, our, emotions, in, ways, only, true, art, can, accomplish, according, to, literary, critic, daniel, s, burt, chekhov, was, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, influential, writers, of, all, time, one, of, the, first, non, russians, to, praise, chekhov, s, plays, was, george, bernard, shaw, who, subtitled, his, heartbreak, house, a, fantasia, in, the, russian, manner, on, english, themes, and, pointed, out, similarities, between, the, predicament, of, the, british, landed, class, and, that, of, their, russian,

six, good, stories, but, he, was, an, amateur, writer, and, vladimir, nabokov, criticised, chekhov, s, medley, of, dreadful, prosaisms, ready, made, epithets, repetitions, but, he, also, declared, yet, it, is, his, works, which, i, would, take, on, a, trip, to, another, planet, and, called, the, lady, with, the, dog, one, of, the, greatest, stories, ever, written, in, its, depiction, of, a, problematic, relationship, and, described, chekhov, as, writing, the, way, one, person, relates, to, another, the, most, important, things, in, his, life, slowly, and, yet, without, a, break, in, a, slightly, subdued, voice, for, the, writer, william, boyd, chekhov, s, historical, accomplishment, was, to, abandon, what, william, gerhardie, called, the, event, plot, for, something, more, blurred,

we, have, rather, the, feeling, that, we, have, overrun, our, signals, or, it, is, as, if, a, tune, had, stopped, short, without, the, expected, chords, to, close, it, these, stories, are, inconclusive, we, say, and, proceed, to, frame, a, criticism, based, upon, the, assumption, that, stories, ought, to, conclude, in, a, way, that, we, recognise, in, so, doing, we, raise, the, question, of, our, own, fitness, as, readers, where, the, tune, is, familiar, and, the, end, emphatic, lovers, united, villains, discomfited, intrigues, exposed, as, it, is, in, most, victorian, fiction, we, can, scarcely, go, wrong, but, where, the, tune, is, unfamiliar, and, the, end, a, note, of, interrogation, or, merely, the, information, that, they, went, on, talking, as, it, is, in, tchekov, we, need, a, very, daring, and, alert, sense, of, literature, to, make, us, hear, the, tune, and, in, particular, those, last, notes, which, complete, the, harmony, michael, goldman, has, said, of, the, elusive, quality, of, chekhov, s, comedies, having, learned, that, chekhov, is, comic, chekhov, is, comic, in, a, very, special, paradoxical, way, his, plays, depend, as, comedy, does, on, the, vitality, of, the, actors, to, make, pleasurable, what, would, otherwise, be, painfully, awkward, inappropriate, speeches, missed, connections, faux, pas, stumbles, childishness, but, as, part, of, a, deeper, pathos, the, stumbles, are, not, pratfalls, but, an, energized, graceful, dissolution, of, purpose, in, the, united, states, chekhov, s, reputation, began, its, rise, slightly, later, partly, through, the, influence, of, stanislavski, s, system, of, acting, with, its, notion, of, subtext, chekhov, often, expressed, his, thought, not, in, speeches, wrote, stanislavski, but,
