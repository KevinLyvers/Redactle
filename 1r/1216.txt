governor, of, herat, the, capital, city, of, the, major, province, of, khorasan, mohammad, khodanbanda, was, disqualified, from, succeeding, his, father, because, an, eye, disease, had, left, him,

abbas, was, barely, eighteen, months, old, he, was, separated, from, his, father, and, his, mother, who, were, transferred, by, tahmasp, to, govern, the, city, of, shiraz, the, nominal, governorship, of, herat, was, handed, over, to, abbas, at, first, tahmasp, intended, to, make, hamza, the, governor, of, herat, but, khayr, al, nisa, begum, was, unwilling, to, be, separated, from, hamza, who, was, her, favourite, son, so, she, persuaded, the, king, to, appoint, abbas, instead, the, fact, that, abbas, was, still, a, baby, was, not, considered, an, obstacle, as, tahmasp, himself, had, been, appointed, titular, governor, of, khorasan, at, the, age, of, two, shah, qoli, sultan, ustajlu, an, amir, from, one, of, the, qizilbash, tribes, called, the, ustajlu, tribe, was, appointed, as, the, actual, governor, and, as, abbas, s, lala, guardian, abbas, s, qizilbash, guardians, and, their, wives, became, substitute, parents, for, him, he, never, saw, his, mother, again, and, only, saw, his, father, fifteen, years, later, abbas, learnt, the, necessary, skills, of, a, soldier, from, his, qizilbash, guardians, he, played, polo, and, went, frequently, on, hunts, like, most, of, the, iranian, kings, he, developed, a, passion, for, hunting, which, was, regarded, as, a, form, of, military, training, abbas, was, educated, alongside, household, slaves, ghulams, who, would, have, become, his, childhood, companions, some, or, perhaps, most, of, them, are, likely, to, have, been, georgians, armenians, or, circassians, on, 14, may, 1576, tahmasp, i, died, without, a, designated, heir, which, led, to, the, realm, descending, into, civil, war, the, following, day, tahmasp, i, s, favourite, son, haydar, mirza, proclaimed, himself, king, with, the, support, of, the, ustajlu, tribe, and, the, powerful, court, georgians, however, he, was, immediately, overthrown, and, killed, by, the, qurchis, the, royal, bodyguards, after, his, death, with, the, support, of, the, majority, of, the, qizilbash, tribes, and, the, endorsement, of, tahmasp, s, influential, daughter, pari, khan, khanum, ismail, mirza, who, had, been, imprisoned, by, his, father, for, twenty, years, was, crowned, king, as, ismail, ii, the, new, king, s, reign, turned, out, to, be, short, and, murderous, the, long, years, of, imprisonment, had, left, him, suffering, from, paranoia, with, the, result, that, he, saw, enemies, everywhere, who, had, to, be, eliminated, first, and, foremost, he, began, murdering, most, of, the, members, of, ustajlu, tribe, regardless, of, whether, or, not, they, had, supported, haydar, mirza, he, also, executed, people, whose, only, crime, was, having, held, a, position, during, tahmasp, s, reign, the, young, abbas, was, directly, affected, by, his, uncle, s, purge, when, a, group, of, horsemen, rushed, into, his, guardian, s, house, shah, qoli, sultan, and, killed, him, ismail, then, turned, on, his, family, he, ordered, the, execution, of, many, of, his, half, brothers, cousins, and, nephews, he, spared, mohammad, khodabandae, possibly, because, they, were, full, brothers, and, perhaps, because, mohammad, khodabanda, was, already, blind, and, disqualified, as, a, possible, claimant, to, the, throne, in, november, 1577, however, ismail, dispatched, ali, qoli, khan, from, the, shamlu, tribe, to, herat, to, kill, the, young, abbas, ali, qoli, delayed, abbas, execution, giving, as, a, reason, that, it, would, be, inappropriate, to, execute, an, innocent, descendant, of, a, seyed, on, holy, days, qadr, night, and, eid, al, fitr, this, dealy, saved, abbas, life, for, on, 24, november, 1577, ismail, ii, died, from, consuming, poisoned, opium, and, ali, qoli, khan, assumed, the, governorship, of, herat, and, the, role, of, guardian, of, abbas, on, 11, or, 13, february, 1578, mohammad, khodabanda, was, chosen, by, the, qizilbash, as, the, new, shah, the, new, shah, appeared, weak, indifferent, and, incompetent, in, these, circumstances, power, soon, passed, into, other, hands, abbas, mother, khayr, al, nisa, begum, was, a, strong, willed, woman, she, took, complete, charge, of, the, administration, and, made, all, the, decisions, even, in, military, matters, the, qizilbash, were, not, happy, to, see, her, taking, power, the, divisions, in, the, safavid, court, encouraged, rebellions, in, various, parts, of, the, country, and, the, old, qizilbash, rivalries, rose, again, with, the, ustajlu, and, shamlu, tribes, immediately, confronting, each, other, mohammad, khodabanda, and, the, queen, asked, ali, qoli, khan, to, bring, abbas, to, qazvin, fearing, that, ali, qoli, khan, was, conspiring, to, enthrone, abbas, but, the, qizilbash, amirs, of, khorasan, argued, that, with, the, threat, of, the, uzbeks, of, bukhara, raiding, near, herat, the, presence, of, a, prince, in, the, city, was, necessary, the, weak, state, of, the, realm, led, to, the, ottoman, empire, declaring, war, against, iran, in, 1578, the, safavid, armies, suffered, several, defeats, before, khayr, al, nisa, begum, organised, a, counter, offensive, together, with, her, son, hamza, mirza, and, the, grand, vizier, mirza, salman, jaberi, she, led, an, army, north, to, confront, the, ottoman, and, tatar, forces, in, shirvan, but, her, attempt, to, dictate, the, campaign, strategy, angered, the, qizilbash, amirs, eventually, on, 26, july, 1579, the, qizilbash, stormed, into, the, harem, where, the, queen, resided, and, strangled, khayr, al, nisa, begum, although, abbas, was, still, only, a, boy, and, barely, knew, his, mother, her, murder, at, the, hands, of, the, qizilbash, made, a, deep, impression, on, him, that, experience, probably, led, to, his, belief, that, the, power, of, the, qizilbash, had, to, be, broken, after, the, queen, s, death, hamza, mirza, aged, eleven, was, proclaimed, crown, prince, the, qizilbash, found, no, reason, to, fear, a, child, so, they, took, control, over, the, realm, while, fighting, among, themselves, over, the, division, of, power, the, conflict, was, most, intense, at, the, court, in, qazvin, and, in, khorasan, where, ali, qoli, khan, shamlu, and, his, principal, ally, murshid, qoli, khan, ustajlu, had, for, some, time, been, at, war, with, the, turkman, governor, of, mashhad, morteza, quli, khan, pornak, the, takkalu, tribe, eventually, seized, the, power, in, qazvin, and, proceeded, to, purge, a, number, of, prominent, shamlu, members, among, them, being, the, mother, and, father, of, ali, qoli, khan, this, angered, ali, qoli, khan, and, just, as, the, queen, had, predicted, in, 1581, he, took, arms, against, the, crown, and, made, his, ward, the, ten, year, old, abbas, the, figurehead, of, a, rebellion, in, khorasan, by, proclaiming, him, shah, of, iran, ali, qoli, and, murshid, qoli, khan, took, control, of, nishapur, there, they, struck, coins, and, read, khutba, in, abbas, name, in, the, following, year, an, army, from, western, iran, advanced, into, khorasan, to, resolve, the, situation, this, army, laid, siege, to, torbat, e, heydarieh, where, murshid, qoli, was, in, control, and, on, herat, where, both, ali, qoli, khan, and, abbas, resided, both, attempts, proved, futile, upon, hearing, the, news, of, another, ottoman, attack, on, northwest, iran, the, leading, ministers, of, the, campaign, hurriedly, reached, an, agreement, with, ali, qoli, khan, the, former, rebel, suffered, no, repercussions, and, only, had, to, pledge, loyalty, to, hamza, mirza, as, the, heir, apparent, he, remained, as, the, governor, and, as, abbas, guardian, and, even, received, a, reward, from, the, shah, mohammad, khodabanda, removed, ali, qoli, khan, s, old, enemy, morteza, quli, khan, pornak, from, his, position, as, governor, of, mashhad, and, replaced, him, with, an, ustajlu, amir, according, to, iskandar, beg, monshi, many, came, to, believe, abbas, mirza, s, claim, would, eventually, prevail, over, hamza, mirza, s, meanwhile, hamza, mirza, was, preoccupied, with, pushing, the, ottomans, out, of, tabriz, however, he, became, caught, up, in, the, rivalries, between, the, qizilbash, tribes, and, angered, his, officers, by, executing, the, qizilbash, governor, of, azarbaijan, on, 5, december, 1586, he, was, assassinated, by, his, personal, barber, who, may, have, had, been, bribed, by, a, group, of, qizilbash, conspirators, this, assassination, provided, a, pathway, for, abbas, ascension, in, the, meantime, in, khorasan, murshid, qoli, khan, emerged, as, a, rival, to, ali, qoli, he, successfully, seized, mashhad, and, abducted, abbas, from, ali, qoli, s, possession, an, uzbek, invasion, advanced, through, khorasan, and, laid, siege, to, herat, this, threatened, murshid, qoli, s, position, who, realised, it, was, his, last, chance, to, enthrone, abbas, many, of, the, qizilbash, amirs, gave, their, assurance, of, their, support, for, placing, abbas, on, the, throne, after, learning, that, mohammad, khodabanda, had, left, qazvin, to, confront, rebels, in, the, south, murshid, qoli, khan, decided, to, strike, during, the, first, ten, days, of, ramadan, 1586, abbas, his, guardian, and, a, small, escort, of, not, more, than, a, few, hundred, horsemen, decided, to, ride, towards, qazvin, as, they, rode, along, the, silk, road, qizilbash, amirs, from, the, powerful, takkalu, afshar, and, zul, al, qadr, tribes, who, controlled, many, of, the, key, towns, on, the, way, came, to, pledge, their, allegiance, by, the, time, they, approached, qazvin, their, small, force, had, increased, to, 2, 000, armed, horsemen, the, lord, mayor, of, qazvin, and, the, qizilbash, amirs, inside, the, city, at, first, urged, resistance, but, they, gave, up, when, crowds, of, citizens, and, soldiers, anxious, to, avoid, fighting, came, out, onto, the, streets, and, voiced, their, support, for, abbas, who, rode, into, the, capital, beside, murshid, qoli, khan, in, late, september, 1587, mohammad, khodabanda, and, his, heir, apparent, abu, taleb, mirza, and, their, entourage, of, ustajlu, and, shamlu, amirs, were, camped, 200, miles, away, in, the, city, of, qom, when, the, news, reached, them, the, amirs, decided, to, abandon, the, shah, and, his, heir, for, abbas, mirza, mohammad, khodabanda, decide, that, he, had, no, choice, but, to, abdicate, on, 1, october, 1587, at, a, ceremony, in, the, palace, in, qazvin, he, placed, his, crown, on, the, head, of, his, seventeen, year, old, son, who, ascended, the, throne, as, abbas, i, murshid, qoli, khan, to, whom, abbas, owed, the, crown, was, rewarded, with, the, title, of, vakil, viceroy, the, empire, abbas, inherited, was, in, a, desperate, state, the, ottomans, had, seized, vast, territories, in, the, west, and, the, north, west, including, the, major, city, of, tabriz, and, the, uzbeks, had, overrun, half, of, khorasan, in, the, north, east, iran, itself, was, riven, by, fighting, between, the, various, factions, of, the, qizilbash, who, had, mocked, royal, authority, by, killing, the, queen, in, 1579, and, the, grand, vizier, mirza, salman, jabiri, in, 1583, firstly, abbas, settled, his, score, with, his, mother, s, killers, executing, three, of, the, ringleaders, of, the, plot, and, exiling, four, others, his, next, task, was, to, free, himself, from, the, power, of, murshid, qoli, khan, murshid, made, abbas, marry, hamza, s, widow, and, a, safavid, cousin, and, began, distributing, important, government, posts, among, his, own, friends, gradually, confining, abbas, to, the, palace, meanwhile, the, uzbeks, continued, their, conquest, of, khorasan, when, abbas, heard, they, were, besieging, his, old, friend, ali, qoli, khan, shamlu, in, herat, he, pleaded, with, murshid, to, take, action, fearing, a, rival, murshid, did, nothing, until, the, news, came, that, herat, had, fallen, and, the, uzbeks, had, slaughtered, the, entire, population, only, then, did, he, set, out, on, campaign, to, khorasan, but, abbas, planned, to, avenge, the, death, of, ali, qoli, khan, and, he, arranged, for, four, qizilbash, leaders, to, kill, murshid, after, a, banquet, on, 23, july, 1589, with, murshid, gone, abbas, could, now, rule, iran, in, his, own, right, abbas, decided, he, must, re, establish, order, within, iran, before, he, took, on, the, foreign, invaders, to, this, end, he, made, a, humiliating, peace, treaty, known, as, the, treaty, of, istanbul, with, the, ottomans, in, 1590, ceding, to, them, the, provinces, of, azerbaijan, karabagh, ganja, dagestan, and, qarajadagh, as, well, as, parts, of, georgia, luristan, and, kurdistan, this, demeaning, treaty, even, ceded, the, previous, capital, of, tabriz, to, the, ottomans, the, qizilbash, had, provided, the, backbone, of, the, safavid, army, from, the, very, beginning, of, safavid, rule, and, they, also, occupied, many, posts, in, the, government, as, a, result, effective, power, in, the, state, in, the, early, days, of, the, dynasty, was, held, by, the, qizilbash, leaving, the, shah, often, powerless, to, counterbalance, their, power, and, as, a, decisive, answer, to, this, problem, abbas, turned, to, the, newly, introduced, members, of, iranian, society, an, initiative, put, in, place, by, shah, tahmasp, i, the, ghulams, a, word, literally, meaning, slaves, from, these, newly, introduced, slaves, the, shah, created, a, military, force, of, up, to, 37, 000, soldiers, completely, funded, by, the, crown, this, weakened, the, power, that, the, qizilbash, had, against, the, crown, significantly, as, they, no, longer, had, a, military, monopoly, in, iran, like, the, janissaries, of, the, neighbouring, ottoman, empire, the, ghulams, were, mainly, georgians, circassians, and, armenians, who, had, been, brought, into, iran, en, masse, by, conquest, and, slave, trade, had, converted, or, had, been, converted, to, islam, and, had, taken, up, service, in, the, army, royal, household, or, the, civil, administration, and, were, loyal, only, to, the, shah, under, abbas, leadership, this, new, grouping, in, iranian, society, also, called, the, third, force, grew, in, influence, and, power, with, many, thousands, of, ethnic, georgians, circassians, and, armenians, becoming, an, integral, part, of, iranian, society, and, taking, up, key, government, royal, household, and, military, positions, tahmasp, i, the, second, safavid, shah, had, realised, by, looking, at, his, own, empire, and, that, of, the, neighbouring, ottomans, that, he, faced, ongoing, threats, from, dangerous, rival, factions, and, internal, family, rivalries, that, were, a, threat, to, him, as, the, head, of, state, if, not, properly, managed, these, rivalries, represented, a, serious, threat, to, the, ruler, or, could, lead, to, unnecessary, court, intrigues, for, tahmasp, the, problem, revolved, around, the, military, tribal, elite, of, the, empire, the, qizilbash, who, believed, that, physical, proximity, to, and, control, of, a, member, of, the, immediate, safavid, family, guaranteed, spiritual, advantages, political, fortune, and, material, advancement, therefore, between, 1540, and, 1555, tahmasp, conducted, a, series, of, invasions, of, the, caucasus, region, which, provided, battle, experience, for, his, soldiers, as, well, as, leading, to, the, capture, of, large, numbers, of, christian, circassian, and, georgian, slaves, 30, 000, in, just, four, raids, these, slaves, would, form, the, basis, of, a, safavid, military, slave, system, these, slaves, would, serve, a, similar, role, in, their, formation, implementation, and, use, to, the, janissaries, of, the, neighbouring, ottoman, empire, their, arrival, in, such, large, numbers, led, to, the, formation, of, a, new, grouping, in, iranian, society, solely, composed, of, ethnic, caucasians, although, the, first, slave, soldiers, would, not, be, organised, until, abbas, reign, during, tahmasp, s, time, caucasians, would, already, become, important, members, of, the, royal, household, the, harem, and, in, the, civil, and, military, administration, learning, from, his, grandfather, abbas, who, had, been, used, by, the, vying, qizilbash, factions, during, his, youth, decided, to, encourage, this, new, caucasian, grouping, in, iranian, society, as, he, realised, that, he, must, impose, his, authority, on, the, qezelb, or, remain, their, puppet, so, abbas, single, handedly, encouraged, the, growth, in, influence, and, power, of, this, new, grouping, also, called, the, third, force, it, is, estimated, that, during, abbas, reign, alone, some, 130, 000, to, 200, 000, georgians, tens, of, thousands, of, circassians, and, around, 300, 000, armenians, were, deported, from, the, caucasus, to, persia, s, heartland, with, a, significant, number, gaining, responsibilities, and, roles, in, iranian, society, including, some, of, the, highest, positions, of, the, state, including, the, ghulam, corps, many, of, those, deported, from, the, caucasus, settled, in, various, regions, of, iran, and, became, craftsmen, farmers, cattle, breeders, traders, soldiers, generals, governors, and, peasants, within, iranian, society, as, part, of, the, ghulam, slave, system, abbas, greatly, expanded, the, ghulam, military, corps, also, known, as, ol, m, n, e, a, ye, e, arifa, crown, servants, from, just, a, few, hundred, during, tahmasp, s, era, to, 15, 000, highly, trained, cavalrymen, as, part, of, a, whole, army, division, of, 40, 000, caucasian, ghulams, abbas, then, reduced, the, number, of, qizilbash, provincial, governorships, and, systematically, moved, qizilbash, governors, to, other, districts, thus, disrupting, their, ties, with, the, local, community, and, reducing, their, power, most, were, eventually, replaced, by, ghulams, whose, loyalty, was, to, the, shah, by, 1595, allahverdi, khan, a, georgian, had, become, one, of, the, most, powerful, men, in, the, safavid, state, when, he, was, appointed, the, governor, general, of, fars, one, of, the, richest, provinces, in, persia, his, power, reached, its, peak, in, 1598, when, he, became, the, commander, in, chief, of, all, the, armed, forces, not, only, did, the, ghulam, system, allow, the, shah, to, control, and, manage, the, rival, qizilbash, turks, and, persians, it, also, resolved, budgetary, problems, in, the, short, term, at, least, for, by, restoring, the, shah, s, complete, control, of, the, provinces, formerly, governed, by, the, qizilbash, chiefs, the, provinces, revenues, now, supplemented, the, royal, treasury, from, now, on, government, officials, collected, the, taxes, and, remitted, them, directly, to, the, royal, treasury, in, the, harem, the, circassians, and, georgians, rapidly, replaced, the, turcoman, factions, and, as, a, result, gained, a, significant, direct, influence, on, the, meritocratic, safavid, bureaucracy, and, the, court, of, the, safavid, state, the, increasing, numbers, of, georgians, and, circassians, in, the, safavid, bureaucracy, and, the, court, of, the, safavid, state, vied, with, the, qizilbash, for, power, and, as, a, result, also, became, involved, in, court, intrigues, this, competition, for, influence, saw, queens, and, their, supporters, in, the, harem, court, and, bureaucracy, compete, against, each, other, in, order, to, get, their, own, sons, on, the, throne, this, competition, increased, under, abbas, and, his, successors, which, weakened, the, dynasty, considerably, abbas, own, son, and, crown, prince, mohammad, baqer, mirza, was, caught, in, the, court, intrigue, involving, several, leading, circassians, which, eventually, led, to, him, being, executed, under, abbas, orders, though, the, ghulam, system, did, not, work, as, well, as, it, had, after, the, safavids, the, third, force, would, continue, to, play, a, crucial, role, during, the, rest, of, the, safavid, era, and, later, until, the, fall, of, the, qajar, dynasty, abbas, needed, ten, years, to, get, his, army, into, shape, so, that, he, could, effectively, confront, his, ottoman, and, uzbek, enemies, during, this, period, the, uzbeks, and, the, ottomans, took, swaths, of, territory, from, iran, he, also, used, military, reorganisation, as, another, way, of, side, lining, the, qizilbash, he, created, a, standing, army, of, many, thousands, of, ghulams, always, conscripted, from, ethnic, georgians, and, circassians, and, to, a, much, lesser, extent, iranians, to, fight, alongside, the, traditional, feudal, force, provided, by, the, qizilbash, the, new, army, regiments, loyalty, was, to, the, shah, the, new, army, consisted, of, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, cavalry, or, squires, conscripted, caucasian, ghulams, armed, with, muskets, and, other, weapons, then, the, largest, cavalry, in, the, world, a, corps, of, musketeers, or, tufangchiyan, 12, 000, strong, and, a, corp, of, artillery, called, tupchiyan, also, 12, 000, strong, in, addition, abbas, had, a, personal, bodyguard, composed, of, caucasian, ghulams, that, was, increased, to, 3, 000, this, force, amounted, to, about, 40, 000, soldiers, paid, for, and, beholden, to, the, shah, abbas, greatly, increased, the, number, of, cannon, at, his, disposal, so, that, he, could, field, 500, cannon, in, a, single, battle, ruthless, discipline, was, enforced, and, looting, was, severely, punished, abbas, was, also, able, to, draw, on, military, advice, from, a, number, of, european, envoys, particularly, the, english, adventurers, sir, anthony, shirley, and, his, brother, robert, shirley, who, arrived, in, 1598, as, envoys, from, the, earl, of, essex, on, an, unofficial, mission, to, persuade, persia, to, enter, into, an, anti, ottoman, alliance, from, 1600, onwards, the, safavid, statesman, all, hverd, khan, in, conjunction, with, robert, shirley, undertook, further, reorganizations, of, the, army, which, led, to, a, further, increase, in, the, number, of, ghulams, to, 25, 000, during, the, 1590s, abbas, moved, to, depose, the, provincial, rulers, of, persia, he, started, with, khan, ahmad, khan, the, ruler, of, gilan, who, had, disobeyed, abbas, orders, when, he, requested, that, khan, ahmad, khan, s, daughter, yakhan, begum, marry, abbas, son, mohammad, baqer, mirza, since, khan, ahmad, khan, had, no, male, successor, khan, ahmad, khan, disagreed, due, to, the, age, of, his, daughter, this, resulted, in, a, safavid, invasion, of, gilan, in, 1591, under, the, leadership, of, one, of, abbas, favourites, farhad, khan, qaramanlu, in, 1593, 94, jahangir, iii, the, paduspanid, ruler, of, nur, travelled, to, the, court, of, the, abbas, where, he, handed, over, his, domains, to, him, and, spend, the, rest, of, his, life, on, an, estate, at, saveh, which, abbas, had, given, to, him, in, 1597, abbas, deposed, the, khorshidi, ruler, of, luristan, one, year, later, jahangir, iv, the, paduspanid, ruler, of, kojur, killed, two, prominent, safavid, nobles, during, a, festival, in, qazvin, in, response, in, 1598, abbas, invaded, his, domains, and, besieged, kojur, jahangir, managed, to, flee, but, was, captured, and, killed, by, a, pro, safavid, paduspanid, named, hasan, lavasani, abbas, first, campaign, with, his, reformed, army, was, against, the, uzbeks, who, had, seized, khorasan, and, were, ravaging, the, province, in, april, 1598, he, went, on, the, attack, one, of, the, two, main, cities, of, the, province, mashhad, was, easily, recaptured, but, the, uzbek, leader, din, mohammed, khan, was, safely, behind, the, walls, of, the, other, chief, city, herat, abbas, managed, to, lure, the, uzbek, army, out, of, the, town, by, feigning, a, retreat, a, bloody, battle, ensued, on, 9, august, 1598, in, the, course, of, which, the, uzbek, khan, was, wounded, and, his, troops, retreated, the, khan, was, murdered, by, his, own, men, during, the, retreat, however, during, the, battle, farhad, khan, had, fled, after, being, wounded, and, was, later, accused, of, fleeing, due, to, cowardice, he, was, nevertheless, forgiven, by, abbas, who, wanted, to, appoint, him, as, the, governor, of, herat, which, farhad, khan, refused, according, to, oruch, beg, farhad, khan, s, refusal, made, abbas, feel, that, he, had, been, insulted, due, to, farhad, khan, s, arrogant, behaviour, and, his, suspected, treason, he, was, seen, as, a, threat, to, abbas, so, abbas, had, him, executed, abbas, then, converted, gilan, and, mazandaran, into, the, crown, domain, khasseh, and, appointed, allahverdi, khan, as, the, new, commander, in, chief, of, the, safavid, army, by, 1599, abbas, had, conquered, not, only, herat, and, mashhad, but, had, moved, as, far, east, as, balkh, this, would, be, a, short, lived, victory, and, he, would, eventually, have, to, settle, on, controlling, only, some, of, this, conquest, after, the, new, ruler, of, the, khanate, of, khiva, baqi, muhammad, khan, attempted, to, retake, balkh, and, abbas, found, his, troops, were, still, no, match, for, the, uzbeks, by, 1603, the, battle, lines, had, stabilized, albeit, with, the, loss, of, the, majority, of, the, persian, artillery, abbas, was, able, to, hold, onto, most, of, khorassan, including, herat, sabzevar, farah, and, nisa, abbas, north, east, frontier, was, now, safe, for, the, time, being, and, he, could, turn, his, attention, to, the, ottomans, in, the, west, after, defeating, the, uzbeks, he, moved, his, capital, from, qazvin, to, isfahan, the, safavids, had, not, yet, beaten, their, archrival, the, ottomans, in, battle, after, a, particularly, arrogant, series, of, demands, from, the, ottoman, ambassador, the, shah, had, him, seized, had, his, beard, shaved, and, sent, it, to, his, master, the, sultan, in, constantinople, this, was, effectively, a, declaration, of, war, in, the, resulting, conflict, abbas, first, recaptured, nahavand, and, destroyed, the, fortress, in, the, city, which, the, ottomans, had, planned, to, use, as, an, advance, base, for, attacks, on, iran, the, next, year, abbas, pretended, he, was, setting, off, on, a, hunting, expedition, to, mazandaran, with, his, men, this, was, merely, a, ruse, to, deceive, the, ottoman, spies, in, his, court, his, real, target, was, azerbaijan, he, changed, course, for, qazvin, where, he, assembled, a, large, army, and, set, off, to, retake, tabriz, which, had, been, in, ottoman, hands, for, some, time, for, the, first, time, the, iranians, made, great, use, of, their, artillery, and, the, town, which, had, been, ruined, by, ottoman, occupation, soon, fell, abbas, set, off, to, besiege, yerevan, a, town, that, had, become, one, of, the, main, ottoman, strongholds, in, the, caucasus, since, the, safavids, had, ceded, it, in, 1590, it, finally, fell, in, june, 1604, and, with, it, the, ottomans, lost, the, support, of, most, armenians, georgians, and, other, caucasians, but, abbas, was, unsure, how, the, new, sultan, ahmed, i, would, respond, and, withdrew, from, the, region, using, scorched, earth, tactics, for, a, year, neither, side, made, a, move, but, in, 1605, abbas, sent, his, general, allahverdi, khan, to, meet, ottoman, forces, on, the, shores, of, lake, van, on, 6, november, 1605, the, iranians, led, by, abbas, scored, a, decisive, victory, over, the, ottomans, at, sufiyan, near, tabriz, in, the, caucasus, during, the, war, abbas, also, managed, to, capture, what, is, now, kabardino, balkaria, the, persian, victory, was, recognised, in, the, treaty, of, nasuh, pasha, in, 1612, effectively, granting, them, back, suzerainty, over, most, of, the, caucasus, several, years, of, peace, followed, as, the, ottomans, carefully, planned, their, response, but, their, secret, training, manoeuvres, were, observed, by, iranian, spies, abbas, learnt, that, the, ottoman, plan, was, to, invade, iran, via, azerbaijan, take, tabriz, then, move, on, to, ardabil, and, qazvin, which, they, could, use, as, bargaining, chips, in, exchange, for, other, territories, the, shah, decided, to, lay, a, trap, he, would, allow, the, ottomans, to, enter, the, country, then, destroy, them, he, had, tabriz, evacuated, of, its, inhabitants, while, he, waited, at, ardabil, with, his, army, in, 1618, an, ottoman, army, of, 100, 000, led, by, the, grand, vizier, damat, halil, pasha, invaded, and, easily, seized, tabriz, the, vizier, sent, an, ambassador, to, the, shah, demanding, he, make, peace, and, return, the, lands, taken, since, 1602, abbas, refused, and, pretended, he, was, ready, to, set, fire, to, ardabil, and, retreat, further, inland, rather, than, face, the, ottoman, army, when, halil, pasha, heard, the, news, he, decided, to, march, on, ardabil, right, away, this, was, just, what, abbas, wanted, his, army, of, 40, 000, was, hiding, at, a, crossroads, on, the, way, and, they, ambushed, the, ottoman, army, in, a, battle, which, ended, in, complete, victory, for, the, iranians, in, 1623, abbas, decided, to, take, back, mesopotamia, which, had, been, lost, by, his, grandfather, tahmasp, through, the, ottoman, safavid, war, 1532, 1555, profiting, from, the, confusion, surrounding, the, accession, of, the, new, ottoman, sultan, murad, iv, he, pretended, to, be, making, a, pilgrimage, to, the, shi, ite, shrines, of, kerbala, and, najaf, but, used, his, army, to, seize, baghdad, however, abbas, was, then, distracted, by, a, rebellion, in, georgia, in, 1624, led, by, giorgi, saakadze, thus, allowing, an, ottoman, force, to, besiege, baghdad, but, the, shah, came, to, its, relief, the, next, year, and, defeated, the, turkish, army, decisively, in, 1638, however, after, abbas, death, the, ottomans, retook, baghdad, and, the, iranian, ottoman, border, was, finalised, to, be, roughly, the, same, as, the, current, iran, turkey, and, iran, iraq, borders, between, 1614, and, 1616, during, the, ottoman, safavid, war, abbas, suppressed, a, rebellion, led, by, his, formerly, loyal, georgian, subjects, luarsab, ii, and, teimuraz, i, also, known, as, tahmuras, khan, in, the, kingdom, of, kakheti, in, 1606, abbas, had, appointed, these, georgians, onto, the, thrones, of, safavid, vassals, kartli, and, kakheti, at, the, behest, of, kartlian, nobles, and, teimuraz, s, mother, ketevan, both, seemed, like, malleable, youths, however, tensions, soon, arose, between, the, shah, and, the, georgian, kings, in, 1613, when, the, shah, summoned, them, to, join, him, on, a, hunting, expedition, in, mazandaran, they, did, not, appear, as, they, feared, that, they, would, be, either, imprisoned, or, killed, at, this, point, war, broke, out, iranian, armies, invaded, the, two, territories, in, march, 1614, and, the, two, allied, kings, subsequently, sought, refuge, in, the, ottoman, vassal, imeretia, abbas, as, reported, by, the, safavid, court, historian, iskander, beg, munshi, was, infuriated, by, what, was, perceived, as, the, defection, of, two, of, his, most, trusted, subjects, and, gholams, he, deported, 30, 000, kakhetian, peasants, to, iran, and, appointed, a, grandson, of, alexander, ii, of, imereti, to, the, throne, of, kartli, jesse, of, kakheti, also, known, as, is, kh, n, raised, up, at, the, court, in, isfahan, and, a, muslim, he, was, perceived, as, fully, loyal, to, the, shah, abbas, threatened, imeretia, with, devastation, if, they, did, not, give, up, the, fugitive, kings, the, imeretian, mingrelian, and, gurian, rulers, jointly, refused, his, demand, luarsab, however, surrendered, voluntarily, to, the, shah, abbas, initially, treated, him, well, but, when, he, learned, that, luarsab, and, teimuraz, had, offered, an, alliance, with, the, ottomans, he, demanded, that, luarsab, accept, islam, when, luarsab, refused, he, was, thrown, in, prison, teimuraz, returned, to, eastern, georgia, in, 1615, taking, advantage, of, a, resurgence, in, ottoman, safavid, hostilities, and, there, he, defeated, a, safavid, force, however, when, the, ottoman, army, postponed, its, invasion, of, the, safavids, abbas, was, able, to, briefly, send, an, army, back, to, defeat, teimuraz, and, redoubled, his, invasion, after, brokering, a, truce, with, the, ottomans, now, iranian, rule, was, fully, restored, over, eastern, georgia, in, a, punitive, expedition, to, kakhetia, his, army, then, killed, perhaps, 60, 000, 70, 000, or, 100, 000, georgians, with, twice, as, many, more, being, deported, to, iran, removing, about, two, thirds, of, the, kakhetian, population, more, refugees, were, rounded, up, in, 1617, in, 1619, abbas, appointed, the, loyal, simon, ii, or, semayun, khan, as, a, puppet, ruler, of, kakheti, while, placing, a, series, of, his, own, governors, to, rule, over, districts, where, the, rebellious, inhabitants, were, mostly, located, having, momentarily, secured, the, region, abbas, took, further, acts, of, revenge, for, the, recalcitrance, of, teimuraz, and, luarsab, he, castrated, teimuraz, s, sons, who, both, died, shortly, afterwards, he, executed, luarsab, in, 1622, and, in, 1624, he, had, ketevan, who, had, been, sent, to, the, shah, as, a, negotiator, tortured, to, death, when, she, refused, to, renounce, christianity, teimuraz, meanwhile, sought, aid, from, the, ottomans, and, russia, abbas, was, then, warned, of, another, imminent, kakhetian, uprising, so, he, returned, to, georgia, in, early, 1625, he, lured, kakhetian, soldiers, on, a, false, pretext, and, then, began, executing, them, he, also, had, plans, to, execute, all, armed, kartlians, including, his, own, general, giorgi, saakadze, however, saakadze, intercepted, a, courier, and, uncovered, the, plot, saakadze, then, defected, to, the, georgians, and, led, a, new, rebellion, which, succeeded, in, throwing, the, persians, out, of, kartli, and, kakheti, while, crowning, teimuraz, as, king, of, both, territories, abbas, counterattacked, in, june, won, the, subsequent, war, and, dethroned, teimuraz, but, lost, half, his, army, at, the, hands, of, the, georgians, and, was, forced, to, accept, kartli, and, kakheti, only, as, vassal, states, while, abandoning, his, plans, to, eliminate, christians, from, the, area, even, then, saakadze, and, teimuraz, launched, another, rebellion, in, 1626, and, were, effective, in, clearing, iranian, forces, from, most, of, the, region, thus, the, georgian, territories, continued, to, resist, safavid, encroachments, until, abbas, death, the, safavids, were, traditionally, allied, with, the, mughals, in, india, against, the, uzbeks, who, coveted, the, province, of, khorasan, the, mughal, emperor, humayun, had, given, abbas, grandfather, shah, tahmasp, the, province, of, kandahar, as, a, reward, for, helping, him, regain, his, throne, in, 1590, profiting, from, the, confusion, in, iran, humayun, s, successor, akbar, seized, kandahar, abbas, continued, to, maintain, cordial, relations, with, the, mughals, even, though, he, pursued, the, return, of, kandahar, finally, in, 1620, a, diplomatic, incident, in, which, the, iranian, ambassador, refused, to, bow, down, in, front, of, the, emperor, jahangir, led, to, war, india, was, embroiled, in, civil, turmoil, and, abbas, realized, that, he, needed, just, a, lightning, raid, to, take, back, the, far, easternmost, town, of, kandahar, in, 1622, after, the, conquest, he, was, very, conciliatory, to, jahangir, claiming, he, had, only, taken, back, what, was, rightly, his, and, disavowing, any, further, territorial, ambitions, jahangir, was, not, appeased, but, he, was, unable, to, recapture, the, province, a, childhood, friend, of, abbas, named, ganj, ali, khan, was, then, appointed, as, the, governor, of, the, city, which, he, would, govern, until, his, death, in, 1624, 5, during, the, 16th, century, the, portuguese, had, established, bases, in, the, persian, gulf, in, 1602, the, iranian, army, under, the, command, of, imam, quli, khan, undiladze, managed, to, expel, the, portuguese, from, bahrain, in, 1622, with, the, help, of, four, english, ships, abbas, retook, hormuz, from, the, portuguese, he, replaced, it, as, a, trading, centre, with, a, new, port, bandar, abbas, nearby, on, the, mainland, but, it, never, became, successful, abbas, moved, his, capital, from, qazvin, to, the, more, central, city, of, isfahan, in, 1598, embellished, by, a, magnificent, series, of, new, mosques, baths, colleges, and, caravansarais, isfahan, became, one, of, the, most, beautiful, cities, in, the, world, as, roger, savory, writes, not, since, the, development, of, baghdad, in, the, eighth, century, a, d, by, the, caliph, al, mansur, had, there, been, such, a, comprehensive, example, of, town, planning, in, the, islamic, world, and, the, scope, and, layout, of, the, city, centre, clearly, reflect, its, status, as, the, capital, of, an, empire, isfahan, became, the, centre, of, safavid, architectural, achievement, with, the, mosques, masjed, e, shah, and, the, masjed, e, sheykh, lotfollah, and, other, monuments, including, the, ali, qapu, the, chehel, sotoun, palace, and, the, naghsh, i, jahan, square, in, making, isfahan, the, centre, of, safavid, empire, abbas, utilized, the, armenian, people, whom, he, had, forcibly, relocated, to, isfahan, from, their, armenian, homelands, once, they, were, settled, he, allowed, them, considerable, freedom, and, encouraged, them, to, continue, in, their, silk, trade, silk, was, an, integral, part, of, the, economy, and, considered, to, be, the, best, form, of, hard, currency, available, the, armenians, had, already, established, trade, networks, that, allowed, abbas, to, strengthen, iran, s, economy, abbas, painting, studios, of, the, isfahan, school, established, under, his, patronage, created, some, of, the, finest, art, in, modern, iranian, history, by, such, illustrious, painters, as, reza, abbasi, and, muhammad, qasim, despite, the, ascetic, roots, of, the, afavid, dynasty, and, the, religious, injunctions, restricting, the, pleasures, lawful, to, the, faithful, the, art, of, abbas, time, denoted, a, certain, relaxation, of, the, strictures, the, portrait, by, muhammad, qasim, suggests, that, the, muslim, prohibition, against, the, consumption, of, wine, as, well, as, that, against, male, intimacy, were, more, honoured, in, the, breach, than, in, the, observance, abbas, brought, in, 300, chinese, potters, to, iran, to, enhance, local, production, of, chinese, style, ceramics, under, abbas, reign, carpet, weaving, increased, its, role, as, an, important, part, of, persian, industry, and, culture, as, wealthy, europeans, started, importing, persian, rugs, silk, production, became, a, monopoly, of, the, crown, and, manuscripts, bookbinding, and, ceramics, were, also, important, exports, like, almost, all, other, safavid, monarchs, abbas, was, a, shi, ite, muslim, he, had, a, particular, veneration, for, imam, hussein, in, 1601, he, made, a, pilgrimage, on, foot, from, isfahan, to, mashhad, site, of, the, shrine, of, imam, reza, which, he, restored, it, had, been, despoiled, by, the, uzbeks, since, sunni, islam, was, the, religion, of, iran, s, main, rival, the, ottoman, empire, abbas, often, treated, sunnis, living, in, western, border, provinces, harshly, abbas, was, usually, tolerant, of, christianity, the, italian, traveller, pietro, della, valle, was, astonished, at, the, shah, s, knowledge, of, christian, history, and, theology, and, establishing, diplomatic, links, with, european, christian, states, was, a, vital, part, of, the, shah, s, foreign, policy, christian, armenia, was, a, key, safavid, province, bordering, the, ottoman, empire, from, 1604, abbas, implemented, a, scorched, earth, policy, in, the, region, to, protect, his, north, western, frontier, against, any, invading, ottoman, forces, a, policy, that, involved, the, forced, resettlement, of, up, to, 300, 000, armenians, from, their, homelands, the, armenians, came, primarily, from, the, wealthy, armenian, merchant, town, of, jugha, also, known, as, jolfa, many, were, transferred, to, new, julfa, a, town, the, shah, had, built, for, the, armenians, primarily, meant, for, these, armenians, from, jugha, old, julfa, near, his, capital, isfahan, thousands, of, armenians, died, on, the, journey, those, who, survived, enjoyed, considerable, religious, freedom, in, new, julfa, where, the, shah, built, them, a, new, cathedral, abbas, aim, was, to, boost, the, iranian, economy, by, encouraging, the, armenian, merchants, who, had, moved, to, new, julfa, as, well, as, religious, liberties, he, also, offered, them, interest, free, loans, and, allowed, the, town, to, elect, its, own, mayor, kalantar, other, armenians, were, transferred, to, the, provinces, of, gilan, and, mazandaran, these, were, less, lucky, abbas, wanted, to, establish, a, second, capital, in, mazandaran, farahabad, but, the, climate, was, unhealthy, and, malarial, many, settlers, died, and, others, gradually, abandoned, the, city, abbas, was, more, intolerant, of, christians, in, georgia, where, the, threat, of, rebellion, loomed, larger, abbas, frequently, demanded, that, nobles, convert, to, shia, islam, and, had, ketevan, the, martyr, tortured, to, death, when, she, refused, abbas, s, anger, at, georgian, rebelliousness, also, generated, his, plan, to, deport, or, exterminate, eastern, georgia, s, christians, and, replace, them, with, turkmens, which, has, been, described, as, genocidal, abbas, tolerance, towards, most, christians, was, part, of, his, policy, of, establishing, diplomatic, links, with, european, powers, to, try, to, enlist, their, help, in, the, fight, against, their, common, enemy, the, ottoman, empire, the, idea, of, such, an, anti, ottoman, alliance, was, not, a, new, one, over, a, century, before, uzun, hassan, then, ruler, of, part, of, iran, had, asked, the, venetians, for, military, aid, but, none, of, the, safavids, had, made, diplomatic, overtures, to, europe, and, abbas, attitude, was, in, marked, contrast, to, that, of, his, grandfather, tahmasp, i, who, had, expelled, the, english, traveller, anthony, jenkinson, from, his, court, upon, hearing, he, was, a, christian, for, his, part, abbas, declared, that, he, preferred, the, dust, from, the, shoe, soles, of, the, lowest, christian, to, the, highest, ottoman, personage, in, 1599, abbas, sent, his, first, diplomatic, mission, to, europe, the, group, crossed, the, caspian, sea, and, spent, the, winter, in, moscow, before, proceeding, through, norway, germany, where, it, was, received, by, emperor, rudolf, ii, to, rome, where, pope, clement, viii, gave, the, travellers, a, long, audience, they, finally, arrived, at, the, court, of, philip, iii, of, spain, in, 1602, although, the, expedition, never, managed, to, return, to, iran, being, shipwrecked, on, the, journey, around, africa, it, marked, an, important, new, step, in, contacts, between, iran, and, europe, and, europeans, began, to, be, fascinated, by, the, iranians, and, their, culture, shakespeare, s, 1601, 02, twelfth, night, for, example, makes, two, references, at, ii, 5, and, iii, 4, to, the, sophy, then, the, english, term, for, the, shahs, of, iran, persian, fashions, such, as, shoes, with, heels, for, men, were, enthusiastically, adopted, by, european, aristocrats, henceforward, the, number, of, diplomatic, missions, to, and, from, persia, greatly, increased, the, shah, had, set, great, store, on, an, alliance, with, spain, the, chief, opponent, of, the, ottomans, in, europe, abbas, offered, trading, rights, and, the, chance, to, preach, christianity, in, iran, in, return, for, help, against, the,
