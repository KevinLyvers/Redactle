illness, pankhurst, blamed, the, poor, conditions, of, the, neighbourhood, and, the, family, moved, to, a, more, affluent, middle, class, district, at, russell, square, she, was, soon, pregnant, once, more, and, declared, that, the, child, was, frank, coming, again, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, on, 7, july, 1889, and, named, him, henry, francis, in, honour, of, his, deceased, brother, pankhurst, made, their, russell, square, home, into, a, centre, for, political, intellectuals, and, activists, including, socialists, protesters, anarchists, suffragists, free, thinkers, radicals, and, humanitarians, of, all, schools, she, took, pleasure, in, decorating, the, house, especially, with, furnishings, from, asia, and, clothing, the, family, in, tasteful, apparel, her, daughter, sylvia,

variety, of, guests, including, indian, mp, dadabhai, naoroji, socialist, activists, herbert, burrows, and, annie, besant, and, french, anarchist, louise, michel, in, 1888, britain, s, first, nationwide, coalition, of, groups, advocating, women, s, right, to, vote, the, national, society, for, women, s, suffrage, nsws, split, after, a, majority, of, members, decided, to, accept, organisations, affiliated, with, political, parties, angry, at, this, decision, some, of, the, group, s, leaders, including, lydia, becker, and, millicent, fawcett, stormed, out, of, the, meeting, and, created, an, alternative, organisation, committed, to, the, old, rules, called, the, great, college, street, society, after, the, location, of, its, headquarters, pankhurst, aligned, herself, with, the, new, rules, group, which, became, known, as, the, parliament, street, society, pss, some, members, of, the, pss, favoured, a, piecemeal, approach, to, gaining, the, vote, because, it, was, often, assumed, that, married, women, did, not, need, the, vote, since, their, husbands, voted, for, them, some, pss, members, felt, that, the, vote, for, single, women, and, widows, was, a, practical, step, along, the, path, to, full, suffrage, when, the, reluctance, within, the, pss, to, advocate, on, behalf, of, married, women, became, clear, pankhurst, and, her, husband, helped, organise, another, new, group, dedicated, to, voting, rights, for, all, women, married, and, unmarried, the, inaugural, meeting, of, the, women, s, franchise, league, wfl, was, held, on, 25, july, 1889, at, the, pankhurst, home, in, russell, square, early, members, of, the, wfl, included, josephine, butler, leader, of, the, ladies, national, association, for, the, repeal, of, the, contagious, diseases, acts, the, pankhursts, friend, elizabeth, clarke, wolstenholme, elmy, and, harriot, eaton, stanton, blatch, daughter, of, us, suffragist, elizabeth, cady, stanton, the, wfl, was, considered, a, radical, organisation, since, in, addition, to, women, s, suffrage, it, supported, equal, rights, for, women, in, the, areas, of, divorce, and, inheritance, it, also, advocated, trade, unionism, and, sought, alliances, with, socialist, organisations, the, more, conservative, group, that, emerged, from, the, nsws, split, spoke, out, against, what, they, called, the, extreme, left, wing, of, the, movement, the, wfl, reacted, by, ridiculing, the, spinster, suffrage, party, and, insisting, that, a, wider, assault, on, social, inequity, was, required, the, group, s, radicalism, caused, some, members, to, leave, both, blatch, and, elmy, resigned, from, the, wfl, the, group, fell, apart, one, year, later, pankhurst, s, shop, never, succeeded, and, he, had, trouble, attracting, business, in, london, with, the, family, s, finances, in, jeopardy, richard, travelled, regularly, to, northwest, england, where, most, of, his, clients, were, in, 1893, the, pankhursts, closed, the, store, and, returned, to, manchester, they, stayed, for, several, months, in, the, seaside, town, of, southport, then, moved, briefly, to, the, village, of, disley, and, finally, settled, into, a, house, in, manchester, s, victoria, park, the, girls, were, enrolled, in, manchester, girls, high, school, where, they, felt, confined, by, the, large, student, population, and, strictly, regimented, schedule, pankhurst, began, to, work, with, several, political, organisations, distinguishing, herself, for, the, first, time, as, an, activist, in, her, own, right, and, gaining, respect, in, the, community, one, biographer, describes, this, period, as, her, emergence, from, richard, s, shadow, in, addition, to, her, work, on, behalf, of, women, s, suffrage, she, became, active, with, the, women, s, liberal, federation, wlf, an, auxiliary, of, the, liberal, party, she, quickly, grew, disenchanted, with, the, group, s, moderate, positions, however, especially, its, unwillingness, to, support, irish, home, rule, and, the, aristocratic, leadership, of, archibald, primrose, in, 1888, pankhurst, had, met, and, befriended, keir, hardie, a, socialist, from, scotland, he, was, elected, to, parliament, in, 1891, and, two, years, later, helped, to, create, the, independent, labour, party, ilp, excited, about, the, range, of, issues, which, the, ilp, pledged, to, confront, pankhurst, resigned, from, the, wfl, and, applied, to, join, the, ilp, the, local, branch, refused, her, admission, on, the, grounds, of, her, sex, but, she, eventually, joined, the, ilp, nationally, christabel, later, wrote, of, her, mother, s, enthusiasm, for, the, party, and, its, organising, efforts, in, this, movement, she, hoped, there, might, be, the, means, of, righting, every, political, and, social, wrong, one, of, her, first, activities, with, the, ilp, found, pankhurst, distributing, food, to, poor, men, and, women, through, the, committee, for, the, relief, of, the, unemployed, in, december, 1894, she, was, elected, to, the, position, of, poor, law, guardian, in, chorlton, on, medlock, she, was, appalled, by, the, conditions, she, witnessed, first, hand, in, the, manchester, workhouse, the, first, time, i, went, into, the, place, i, was, horrified, to, see, little, girls, seven, and, eight, years, old, on, their, knees, scrubbing, the, cold, stones, of, the, long, corridors, bronchitis, was, epidemic, among, them, most, of, the, time, i, found, that, there, were, pregnant, women, in, that, workhouse, scrubbing, floors, doing, the, hardest, kind, of, work, almost, until, their, babies, came, into, the, world, of, course, the, babies, are, very, badly, protected, these, poor, unprotected, mothers, and, their, babies, i, am, sure, were, potent, factors, in, my, education, as, a, militant, pankhurst, immediately, began, to, change, these, conditions, and, established, herself, as, a, successful, voice, of, reform, on, the, board, of, guardians, her, chief, opponent, was, a, passionate, man, named, mainwaring, known, for, his, rudeness, recognising, that, his, loud, anger, was, hurting, his, chances, of, persuading, those, aligned, with, pankhurst, he, kept, a, note, nearby, during, meetings, keep, your, temper, after, helping, her, husband, with, another, unsuccessful, parliamentary, campaign, pankhurst, faced, legal, troubles, in, 1896, when, she, and, two, men, violated, a, court, order, against, ilp, meetings, at, boggart, hole, clough, with, richard, s, volunteering, his, time, as, legal, counsel, they, refused, to, pay, fines, and, the, two, men, spent, a, month, in, prison, the, punishment, was, never, ordered, for, pankhurst, however, possibly, because, the, magistrate, feared, public, backlash, against, the, imprisonment, of, a, woman, so, respected, in, the, community, asked, by, an, ilp, reporter, if, she, were, prepared, to, spend, time, in, prison, pankhurst, replied, oh, yes, quite, it, wouldn, t, be, so, very, dreadful, you, know, and, it, would, be, a, valuable, experience, although, ilp, meetings, were, eventually, permitted, the, episode, was, a, strain, on, pankhurst, s, health, and, caused, loss, of, income, for, their, family, during, the, struggle, at, boggart, hole, clough, richard, pankhurst, began, to, experience, severe, stomach, pains, he, had, developed, a, gastric, ulcer, and, his, health, deteriorated, in, 1897, the, family, moved, briefly, to, mobberley, with, the, hope, that, country, air, would, help, his, condition, he, soon, felt, well, again, and, the, family, returned, to, manchester, in, the, autumn, in, the, summer, of, 1898, he, suffered, a, sudden, relapse, emmeline, pankhurst, had, taken, their, oldest, daughter, christabel, to, corsier, switzerland, to, visit, her, old, friend, no, mie, a, telegram, arrived, from, richard, reading, i, am, not, well, please, come, home, my, love, leaving, christabel, with, no, mie, pankhurst, returned, immediately, to, england, on, 5, july, while, on, a, train, from, london, to, manchester, she, noticed, a, newspaper, announcing, the, death, of, richard, pankhurst, the, loss, of, her, husband, left, pankhurst, with, new, responsibilities, and, a, significant, amount, of, debt, she, moved, the, family, to, a, smaller, house, at, 62, nelson, street, resigned, from, the, board, of, guardians, and, was, given, a, paid, position, as, registrar, of, births, and, deaths, in, chorlton, this, work, gave, her, more, insight, into, the, conditions, of, women, in, the, region, she, wrote, in, her, autobiography, they, used, to, tell, me, their, stories, dreadful, stories, some, of, them, and, all, of, them, pathetic, with, that, patient, and, uncomplaining, pathos, of, poverty, her, observations, of, the, differences, between, the, lives, of, men, and, women, for, example, in, relation, to, illegitimacy, reinforced, her, conviction, that, women, needed, the, right, to, vote, before, their, conditions, could, improve, in, 1900, she, was, elected, to, the, manchester, school, board, and, saw, new, examples, of, women, suffering, unequal, treatment, and, limited, opportunities, during, this, time, she, also, re, opened, her, store, with, the, hope, that, it, would, provide, additional, income, for, the, family, the, individual, identities, of, the, pankhurst, children, began, to, emerge, around, the, time, of, their, father, s, death, before, long, they, were, all, involved, in, the, struggle, for, women, s, suffrage, christabel, enjoyed, a, privileged, status, among, the, daughters, as, sylvia, noted, in, 1931, she, was, our, mother, s, favourite, we, all, knew, it, and, i, for, one, never, resented, the, fact, christabel, did, not, share, her, mother, s, fervour, for, political, work, however, until, she, befriended, the, suffrage, activists, esther, roper, and, eva, gore, booth, she, soon, became, involved, with, the, suffrage, movement, and, joined, her, mother, at, speaking, events, sylvia, took, lessons, from, a, respected, local, artist, and, soon, received, a, scholarship, to, the, manchester, school, of, art, she, went, on, to, study, art, in, florence, and, venice, the, younger, children, adela, and, harry, had, difficulty, finding, a, path, for, their, studies, adela, was, sent, to, a, local, boarding, school, where, she, was, cut, off, from, her, friends, and, contracted, head, lice, harry, also, had, difficulty, at, school, he, suffered, from, measles, and, vision, problems, by, 1903, pankhurst, believed, that, years, of, moderate, speeches, and, promises, about, women, s, suffrage, from, members, of, parliament, mps, had, yielded, no, progress, although, suffrage, bills, in, 1870, 1886, and, 1897, had, shown, promise, each, was, defeated, she, doubted, that, political, parties, with, their, many, agenda, items, would, ever, make, women, s, suffrage, a, priority, she, even, broke, with, the, ilp, when, it, refused, to, focus, on, votes, for, women, it, was, necessary, to, abandon, the, patient, tactics, of, existing, advocacy, groups, she, believed, in, favour, of, more, militant, actions, thus, on, 10, october, 1903, pankhurst, and, several, colleagues, founded, the, women, s, social, and, political, union, wspu, an, organisation, open, only, to, women, and, focused, on, direct, action, to, win, the, vote, deeds, she, wrote, later, not, words, was, to, be, our, permanent, motto, the, wspu, confined, its, membership, to, women, men, could, not, become, members, the, group, s, early, militancy, took, non, violent, forms, in, addition, to, making, speeches, and, gathering, petition, signatures, the, wspu, organised, rallies, and, published, a, newsletter, called, votes, for, women, the, group, also, convened, a, series, of, women, s, parliaments, for, example, in, caxton, hall, to, coincide, with, official, government, sessions, when, a, bill, for, women, s, suffrage, was, filibustered, on, 12, may, 1905, pankhurst, and, other, wspu, members, began, a, loud, protest, outside, the, parliament, building, police, immediately, forced, them, away, from, the, building, where, they, regrouped, and, demanded, passage, of, the, bill, although, the, bill, was, never, resurrected, pankhurst, considered, it, a, successful, demonstration, of, militancy, s, power, to, capture, attention, pankhurst, declared, in, 1906, we, are, at, last, recognized, as, a, political, party, we, are, now, in, the, swim, of, politics, and, are, a, political, force, before, long, all, three, of, her, daughters, became, active, with, the, wspu, christabel, was, arrested, after, spitting, at, a, policeman, during, a, meeting, of, the, liberal, party, in, october, 1905, adela, and, sylvia, were, arrested, a, year, later, during, a, protest, outside, parliament, pankhurst, was, arrested, for, the, first, time, in, february, 1908, when, she, tried, to, enter, parliament, to, deliver, a, protest, resolution, to, prime, minister, h, h, asquith, she, was, charged, with, obstruction, and, sentenced, to, six, weeks, in, prison, she, spoke, out, against, the, conditions, of, her, confinement, including, vermin, meagre, food, and, the, civilised, torture, of, solitary, confinement, and, absolute, silence, to, which, she, and, others, were, ordered, pankhurst, saw, imprisonment, as, a, means, to, publicise, the, urgency, of, women, s, suffrage, in, june, 1909, she, struck, a, police, officer, twice, in, the, face, to, ensure, she, would, be, arrested, pankhurst, was, arrested, seven, times, before, women, s, suffrage, was, approved, during, her, trial, on, 21, october, 1908, she, told, the, court, we, are, here, not, because, we, are, law, breakers, we, are, here, in, our, efforts, to, become, law, makers, the, exclusive, focus, of, the, wspu, on, votes, for, women, was, another, hallmark, of, its, militancy, while, other, organisations, agreed, to, work, with, individual, political, parties, the, wspu, insisted, on, separating, itself, from, and, in, many, cases, opposing, parties, which, did, not, make, women, s, suffrage, a, priority, the, group, protested, against, all, candidates, belonging, to, the, party, of, the, ruling, government, since, it, refused, to, pass, women, s, suffrage, legislation, this, brought, them, into, immediate, conflict, with, liberal, party, organisers, particularly, since, many, liberal, candidates, supported, women, s, suffrage, one, early, target, of, wspu, opposition, was, future, prime, minister, winston, churchill, his, opponent, attributed, churchill, s, defeat, in, part, to, those, ladies, who, are, sometimes, laughed, at, members, of, the, wspu, were, sometimes, heckled, and, derided, for, spoiling, elections, for, liberal, candidates, on, 18, january, 1908, pankhurst, and, her, associate, nellie, martel, were, attacked, by, an, all, male, crowd, of, liberal, supporters, who, blamed, the, wspu, for, costing, them, a, recent, by, election, to, the, conservative, candidate, the, men, threw, clay, rotten, eggs, and, stones, packed, in, snow, the, women, were, beaten, and, pankhurst, s, ankle, was, severely, bruised, similar, tensions, later, formed, with, labour, until, party, leaders, made, the, vote, for, women, a, priority, however, the, wspu, vowed, to, continue, its, militant, activism, pankhurst, and, others, in, the, union, saw, party, politics, as, distracting, to, the, goal, of, women, s, suffrage, and, criticised, other, organisations, for, putting, party, loyalty, ahead, of, women, s, votes, as, the, wspu, gained, recognition, and, notoriety, for, its, actions, pankhurst, resisted, efforts, to, democratise, the, organisation, itself, in, 1907, a, small, group, of, members, led, by, teresa, billington, greig, called, for, more, involvement, from, the, rank, and, file, suffragettes, at, the, union, s, annual, meetings, in, response, pankhurst, announced, at, a, wspu, meeting, that, elements, of, the, organisation, s, constitution, relating, to, decision, making, were, void, and, cancelled, the, annual, meetings, she, also, insisted, that, a, small, committee, chosen, by, the, members, in, attendance, be, allowed, to, co, ordinate, wspu, activities, pankhurst, and, her, daughter, christabel, were, chosen, along, with, mabel, tuke, and, emmeline, pethick, lawrence, as, members, of, the, new, committee, frustrated, several, members, including, billington, greig, and, charlotte, despard, quit, to, form, their, own, organisation, the, women, s, freedom, league, in, her, 1914, autobiography, pankhurst, dismissed, criticism, of, the, wspu, s, leadership, structure, if, at, any, time, a, member, or, a, group, of, members, loses, faith, in, our, policy, if, any, one, begins, to, suggest, that, some, other, policy, ought, to, be, substituted, or, if, she, tries, to, confuse, the, issue, by, adding, other, policies, she, ceases, at, once, to, be, a, member, autocratic, quite, so, but, you, may, object, a, suffrage, organisation, ought, to, be, democratic, well, the, members, of, the, w, s, p, u, do, not, agree, with, you, we, do, not, believe, in, the, effectiveness, of, the, ordinary, suffrage, organisation, the, w, s, p, u, is, not, hampered, by, a, complexity, of, rules, we, have, no, constitution, and, by, laws, nothing, to, be, amended, or, tinkered, with, or, quarrelled, over, at, an, annual, meeting, the, w, s, p, u, is, simply, a, suffrage, army, in, the, field, on, 21, june, 1908, 500, 000, activists, rallied, in, hyde, park, to, demand, votes, for, women, this, day, is, the, beginning, of, women, s, sunday, it, was, organised, by, the, wspn, the, massive, demonstration, for, women, s, suffrage, saw, thousands, march, in, seven, processions, all, over, london, gathering, for, a, day, of, peaceful, protest, asquith, and, leading, mps, responded, with, indifference, angered, by, this, intransigence, and, abusive, police, activity, some, wspu, members, increased, the, severity, of, their, actions, soon, after, the, rally, twelve, women, gathered, in, parliament, square, and, tried, to, deliver, speeches, for, women, s, suffrage, police, officers, seized, several, of, the, speakers, and, pushed, them, into, a, crowd, of, opponents, who, had, gathered, nearby, frustrated, two, wspu, members, edith, new, and, mary, leigh, went, to, 10, downing, street, and, hurled, rocks, at, the, windows, of, the, prime, minister, s, home, they, insisted, their, act, was, independent, of, the, wspu, command, but, pankhurst, expressed, her, approval, of, the, action, when, a, magistrate, sentenced, new, and, leigh, to, two, months, imprisonment, pankhurst, reminded, the, court, of, how, various, male, political, agitators, had, broken, windows, to, win, legal, and, civil, rights, throughout, britain, s, history, in, 1909, the, hunger, strike, was, added, to, the, wspu, s, repertoire, of, resistance, on, 24, june, marion, wallace, dunlop, was, arrested, for, writing, an, excerpt, from, the, bill, of, rights, 1688, or, 1689, on, a, wall, in, the, house, of, commons, angered, by, the, conditions, of, the, jail, dunlop, went, on, a, hunger, strike, when, it, proved, effective, fourteen, women, imprisoned, for, smashing, windows, began, to, fast, wspu, members, soon, became, known, around, the, country, for, holding, prolonged, hunger, strikes, to, protest, their, incarceration, prison, authorities, frequently, force, fed, the, women, using, tubes, inserted, through, the, nose, or, mouth, the, painful, techniques, which, in, the, case, of, mouth, feeding, required, the, use, of, steel, gags, to, force, the, mouth, open, brought, condemnation, from, suffragists, and, medical, professionals, these, tactics, caused, some, tension, between, the, wspu, and, more, moderate, organisations, which, had, coalesced, into, the, national, union, of, women, s, suffrage, societies, nuwss, that, group, s, leader, millicent, fawcett, originally, hailed, wspu, members, for, their, courage, and, dedication, to, the, cause, by, 1912, however, she, declared, that, hunger, strikes, were, mere, publicity, stunts, and, that, militant, activists, were, the, chief, obstacles, in, the, way, of, the, success, of, the, suffrage, movement, in, the, house, of, commons, the, nuwss, refused, to, join, a, march, of, women, s, suffrage, groups, after, demanding, without, success, that, the, wspu, end, its, support, of, property, destruction, fawcett, s, sister, elizabeth, garrett, anderson, later, resigned, from, the, wspu, for, similar, reasons, press, coverage, was, mixed, many, journalists, noted, that, crowds, of, women, responded, positively, to, speeches, by, pankhurst, while, others, condemned, her, radical, approach, to, the, issue, the, daily, news, urged, her, to, endorse, a, more, moderate, approach, and, other, press, outlets, condemned, the, breaking, of, windows, by, wspu, members, in, 1906, daily, mail, journalist, charles, hands, referred, to, militant, women, using, the, diminutive, term, suffragette, rather, than, the, standard, suffragist, pankhurst, and, her, allies, seized, the, term, as, their, own, and, used, it, to, differentiate, themselves, from, moderate, groups, the, last, half, of, the, century, s, first, decade, was, a, time, of, sorrow, loneliness, and, constant, work, for, pankhurst, in, 1907, she, sold, her, home, in, manchester, and, began, an, itinerant, lifestyle, moving, from, place, to, place, as, she, spoke, and, marched, for, women, s, suffrage, she, stayed, with, friends, and, in, hotels, carrying, her, few, possessions, in, suitcases, although, she, was, energized, by, the, struggle, and, found, joy, in, giving, energy, to, others, her, constant, travelling, meant, separation, from, her, children, especially, christabel, who, had, become, the, national, coordinator, of, the, wspu, in, 1909, as, pankhurst, planned, a, speaking, tour, of, the, united, states, henry, was, paralyzed, after, his, spinal, cord, became, inflamed, she, hesitated, to, leave, the, country, while, he, was, ill, but, she, needed, money, to, pay, for, his, treatment, and, the, tour, promised, to, be, lucrative, on, her, return, from, a, successful, tour, she, sat, by, henry, s, bedside, as, he, died, on, 5, january, 1910, five, days, later, she, buried, him, beside, his, brother, frank, in, highgate, cemetery, then, spoke, before, 5, 000, people, in, manchester, liberal, party, supporters, who, had, come, to, heckle, her, remained, quiet, as, she, addressed, the, crowd, after, the, liberal, losses, in, the, 1910, elections, ilp, member, and, journalist, henry, brailsford, helped, organise, a, conciliation, committee, for, women, s, suffrage, which, gathered, 54, mps, from, various, parties, the, group, s, conciliation, bill, looked, to, be, a, narrowly, defined, but, still, significant, possibility, to, achieve, the, vote, for, some, women, thus, the, wspu, agreed, to, suspend, its, support, for, window, breaking, and, hunger, strikes, while, it, was, being, negotiated, when, it, became, clear, that, the, bill, would, not, pass, pankhurst, declared, if, the, bill, in, spite, of, our, efforts, is, killed, by, the, government, then, i, have, to, say, there, is, an, end, to, the, truce, when, it, was, defeated, pankhurst, led, a, protest, march, of, 300, women, to, parliament, square, on, 18, november, they, were, met, with, aggressive, police, response, directed, by, home, secretary, winston, churchill, officers, punched, the, marchers, twisted, arms, and, pulled, on, women, s, breasts, although, pankhurst, was, allowed, to, enter, parliament, prime, minister, asquith, refused, to, meet, her, the, incident, became, known, as, black, friday, her, sister, mary, jane, who, had, attended, the, protest, too, was, arrested, for, the, third, time, a, few, days, later, she, was, sentenced, to, a, month, of, imprisonment, on, christmas, day, she, died, at, the, home, of, their, brother, herbert, goulden, two, days, after, her, release, as, subsequent, conciliation, bills, were, introduced, wspu, leaders, advocated, a, halt, to, militant, tactics, aileen, preston, was, appointed, as, pankhurst, s, driver, in, april, 1911, to, drive, her, around, the, country, to, help, spread, the, suffrage, message, in, march, 1912, the, second, bill, was, in, jeopardy, and, pankhurst, joined, a, fresh, outbreak, of, window, smashing, extensive, property, damage, led, police, to, raid, the, wspu, offices, pankhurst, and, emmeline, pethick, lawrence, were, tried, at, the, old, bailey, and, convicted, of, conspiracy, to, commit, property, damage, christabel, who, by, 1912, was, the, chief, coordinator, for, the, organisation, was, also, wanted, by, police, she, fled, to, paris, where, she, directed, wspu, strategy, in, exile, inside, holloway, prison, emmeline, pankhurst, staged, her, first, hunger, strike, to, improve, conditions, for, other, suffragettes, in, nearby, cells, she, was, quickly, joined, by, pethick, lawrence, and, other, wspu, members, she, described, in, her, autobiography, the, trauma, caused, by, force, feeding, during, the, strike, holloway, became, a, place, of, horror, and, torment, sickening, scenes, of, violence, took, place, almost, every, hour, of, the, day, as, the, doctors, went, from, cell, to, cell, performing, their, hideous, office, when, prison, officials, tried, to, enter, her, cell, pankhurst, raised, a, clay, jug, over, her, head, and, announced, if, any, of, you, dares, so, much, as, to, take, one, step, inside, this, cell, i, shall, defend, myself, pankhurst, was, spared, further, force, feeding, attempts, after, this, incident, but, she, continued, to, violate, the, law, and, when, imprisoned, starve, herself, in, protest, during, the, following, two, years, she, was, arrested, numerous, times, but, was, frequently, released, after, several, days, because, of, her, ill, health, later, the, asquith, government, enacted, the, cat, and, mouse, act, which, allowed, similar, releases, for, other, suffragettes, facing, ill, health, due, to, hunger, strikes, prison, officials, recognised, the, potential, public, relations, disaster, that, would, erupt, if, the, popular, wspu, leader, were, force, fed, or, allowed, to, suffer, extensively, in, jail, still, police, officers, arrested, her, during, talks, and, as, she, marched, she, tried, to, evade, police, harassment, by, wearing, disguises, and, eventually, the, wspu, established, a, jujutsu, trained, female, bodyguard, squad, to, physically, protect, her, against, the, police, she, and, other, escorts, were, targeted, by, police, resulting, in, violent, scuffles, as, officers, tried, to, detain, pankhurst, in, 1912, wspu, members, adopted, arson, as, another, tactic, to, win, the, vote, after, prime, minister, asquith, had, visited, the, theatre, royal, in, dublin, suffragette, activists, gladys, evans, lizzie, baker, mary, leigh, and, mabel, capper, attempted, to, cause, an, explosion, using, gunpowder, and, benzine, which, resulted, in, minimal, damage, during, the, same, evening, mary, leigh, threw, an, axe, at, the, carriage, containing, john, redmond, leader, of, the, irish, parliamentary, party, the, lord, mayor, and, asquith, over, the, next, two, years, women, set, fire, to, a, refreshments, building, in, regent, s, park, an, orchid, house, at, kew, gardens, pillar, boxes, and, a, railway, carriage, emily, davison, threw, herself, under, the, king, s, horse, anmer, at, the, epsom, derby, in, 1913, her, funeral, drew, 55, 000, attendees, along, the, streets, and, at, the, funeral, this, gave, significant, publicity, to, the, movement, although, pankhurst, confirmed, that, these, women, had, not, been, commanded, by, her, or, christabel, they, both, assured, the, public, that, they, supported, the, arsonist, suffragettes, there, were, similar, incidents, around, the, country, one, wspu, member, for, example, put, a, small, hatchet, into, the, prime, minister, s, carriage, inscribed, with, the, words, votes, for, women, and, other, suffragettes, used, acid, to, burn, the, same, slogan, into, golf, courses, used, by, mps, in, 1914, mary, richardson, slashed, the, velasquez, painting, rokeby, venus, to, protest, against, pankhurst, s, imprisonment, the, wspu, s, approval, of, property, destruction, led, to, the, departure, of, several, important, members, the, first, were, emmeline, pethick, lawrence, and, her, husband, frederick, they, had, long, been, integral, members, of, the, group, s, leadership, but, found, themselves, in, conflict, with, christabel, about, the, wisdom, of, such, volatile, tactics, after, returning, from, a, vacation, in, canada, they, found, that, pankhurst, had, expelled, them, from, the, wspu, the, pair, found, the, decision, appalling, but, to, avoid, a, schism, in, the, movement, they, continued, to, praise, pankhurst, and, the, organisation, in, public, around, the, same, time, emmeline, s, daughter, adela, left, the, group, she, disapproved, of, wspu, endorsement, of, property, destruction, and, felt, that, a, heavier, emphasis, on, socialism, was, necessary, adela, s, relationship, with, her, family, especially, christabel, was, also, strained, as, a, result, the, deepest, rift, in, the, pankhurst, family, came, in, november, 1913, when, sylvia, spoke, at, a, meeting, of, socialists, and, trade, unionists, in, support, of, trade, union, organiser, jim, larkin, she, had, been, working, with, the, east, london, federation, of, suffragettes, elfs, a, local, branch, of, the, wspu, which, had, a, close, relationship, with, socialists, and, organised, labour, the, close, connection, to, labour, groups, and, sylvia, s, appearance, on, stage, with, frederick, pethick, lawrence, who, also, addressed, the, crowd, convinced, christabel, that, her, sister, was, organising, a, group, that, might, challenge, the, wspu, in, the, suffrage, movement, the, dispute, became, public, and, members, of, groups, including, the, wspu, ilp, and, elfs, braced, themselves, for, a, showdown, after, being, dismissed, from, the, wspu, sylvia, felt, bruised, as, one, does, when, fighting, the, foe, without, one, is, struck, by, the, friend, within, in, january, sylvia, was, summoned, to, paris, where, emmeline, and, christabel, were, waiting, their, mother, had, just, returned, from, another, tour, of, the, us, and, sylvia, had, just, been, released, from, prison, all, three, women, were, exhausted, and, stressed, which, added, considerably, to, the, tension, in, her, 1931, book, the, suffrage, movement, sylvia, describes, christabel, as, an, unreasonable, figure, haranguing, her, for, refusing, to, toe, the, wspu, line, she, turned, to, me, you, have, your, own, ideas, we, do, not, want, that, we, want, all, our, women, to, take, their, instructions, and, walk, in, step, like, an, army, too, tired, too, ill, to, argue, i, made, no, reply, i, was, oppressed, by, a, sense, of, tragedy, grieved, by, her, ruthlessness, her, glorification, of, autocracy, seemed, to, me, remote, indeed, from, the, struggle, we, were, waging, the, grim, fight, even, now, proceeding, in, the, cells, i, thought, of, many, others, who, had, been, thrust, aside, for, some, minor, difference, with, their, mother, s, blessing, christabel, ordered, sylvia, s, group, to, dissociate, from, the, wspu, pankhurst, tried, to, persuade, the, elfs, to, remove, the, word, suffragettes, from, its, name, since, it, was, inextricably, linked, to, the, wspu, when, sylvia, refused, her, mother, switched, to, fierce, anger, in, a, letter, you, are, unreasonable, always, have, been, i, fear, always, will, be, i, suppose, you, were, made, so, had, you, chosen, a, name, which, we, could, approve, we, could, have, done, much, to, launch, you, advertise, your, society, by, name, now, you, must, take, your, own, way, of, doing, so, i, am, sorry, but, you, make, your, own, difficulties, by, an, incapacity, to, look, at, situations, from, other, people, s, point, of, view, as, well, as, your, own, perhaps, in, time, you, will, learn, the, lessons, that, we, all, have, to, learn, in, life, adela, unemployed, and, unsure, of, her, future, had, become, a, worry, for, pankhurst, as, well, she, decided, that, adela, should, move, to, australia, and, paid, for, her, relocation, they, never, saw, one, another, again, in, november, 1917, the, wspu, s, weekly, newspaper, announced, that, the, wspu, was, to, become, the, women, s, party, twelve, months, later, on, tuesday, 19, november, at, the, queen, s, hall, in, london, emmeline, pankhurst, said, that, her, daughter, christabel, would, be, their, candidate, at, the, forthcoming, general, election, the, first, at, which, women, could, stand, as, candidates, they, didn, t, say, which, constituency, they, would, fight, but, a, few, days, later, westbury, in, wiltshire, was, identified, emmeline, lobbied, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, to, ensure, christabel, would, have, coalition, backing, however, as, these, discussions, were, taking, place, the, pankhurst, s, switched, their, attention, to, smethwick, in, staffordshire, the, coalition, had, already, settled, on, a, local, candidate, major, samuel, nock, thompson, but, bonar, law, the, conservative, leader, was, persuaded, to, ask, thompson, to, withdraw, significantly, christabel, was, not, issued, with, a, formal, letter, of, support, from, the, two, leaders, the, coalition, coupon, christabel, then, had, a, straight, fight, with, the, labour, candidate, john, davison, and, lost, by, 775, votes, the, women, s, party, fought, no, other, elections, and, closed, soon, after, when, the, first, world, war, began, in, august, 1914, emmeline, and, christabel, considered, that, the, threat, posed, by, germany, was, a, danger, to, all, humanity, and, that, the, british, government, needed, the, support, of, all, men, they, persuaded, the, wspu, to, halt, all, militant, suffrage, activities, until, fighting, on, the, european, mainland, ended, it, was, no, time, for, dissent, or, agitation, christabel, wrote, later, this, was, national, militancy, as, suffragists, we, could, not, be, pacifists, at, any, price, a, truce, with, the, government, was, established, all, wspu, prisoners, were, released, and, christabel, returned, to, london, emmeline, and, christabel, set, the, wspu, into, motion, on, behalf, of, the, war, effort, in, her, first, speech, after, returning, to, britain, christabel, warned, of, the, german, peril, she, urged, the, gathered, women, to, follow, the, example, of, their, french, sisters, who, while, the, men, fought, are, able, to, keep, the, country, going, to, get, in, the, harvest, to, carry, on, the, industries, emmeline, tried, to, shame, men, in, to, volunteering, for, the, front, lines, sylvia, and, adela, meanwhile, did, not, share, their, mother, s, enthusiasm, for, the, war, as, committed, pacifists, they, rejected, the, wspu, s, support, for, the, government, sylvia, s, socialist, perspective, convinced, her, that, the, war, was, another, example, of, capitalist, oligarchs, exploiting, poor, soldiers, and, workers, adela, meanwhile, spoke, against, the, war, in, australia, and, made, public, her, opposition, to, conscription, in, a, short, letter, emmeline, told, sylvia, i, am, ashamed, to, know, where, you, and, adela, stand, she, had, a, similar, impatience, for, dissent, within, the, wspu, when, long, time, member, mary, leigh, asked, a, question, during, a, meeting, in, october, 1915, pankhurst, replied, that, woman, is, a, pro, german, and, should, leave, the, hall, i, denounce, you, as, a, pro, german, and, wish, to, forget, that, such, a, person, ever, existed, some, wspu, members, were, outraged, by, this, sudden, rigid, devotion, to, the, government, the, leadership, s, perceived, abandonment, of, efforts, to, win, the, vote, for, women, and, questions, about, how, funds, collected, on, behalf, of, suffrage, were, being, managed, with, regard, to, the, organisation, s, new, focus, two, groups, split, from, the, wspu, the, suffragettes, of, the,

pankhurst, put, the, same, energy, and, determination, she, had, previously, applied, to, women, s, suffrage, into, patriotic, advocacy, of, the, war, effort, she, organised, rallies, toured, constantly, delivering, speeches, and, lobbied, the, government, to, help, women, enter, the, work, force, while, men, were, overseas, fighting, another, issue, which, concerned, her, greatly, at, the, time, was, the, plight, of, so, called, war, babies, children, born, to, single, mothers, whose, fathers, were, on, the, front, lines, pankhurst, established, an, adoption, home, at, campden, hill, designed, to, employ, the, montessori, method, of, childhood, education, some, women, criticised, pankhurst, for, offering, relief, to, parents, of, children, born, out, of, wedlock, but, she, declared, indignantly, that, the, welfare, of, children, whose, suffering, she, had, seen, firsthand, as, a, poor, law, guardian, was, her, only, concern, due, to, lack, of, funds, however, the, home, was, soon, turned, over, to, princess, alice, pankhurst, herself, adopted, four, children, whom, she, renamed, kathleen, king, flora, mary, gordon, later, mary, hodgson, joan, pembridge, and, elizabeth, tudor, they, lived, in, london, where, for, the, first, time, in, many, years, she, had, a, permanent, home, at, holland, park, asked, how, at, the, age, of, 57, and, with, no, steady, income, she, could, take, on, the, burden, of, bringing, up, four, more, children, pankhurst, replied, my, dear, i, wonder, i, didn, t, take, forty, the, historian, brian, harrison, interviewed, mary, hodgson, about, pankhurst, in, july, 1976, as, part, of, the, suffrage, interviews, project, titled, oral, evidence, on, the, suffragette, and, suffragist, movements, the, brian, harrison, interviews, she, talks, about, pankhurst, s, approach, to, motherhood, and, education, their, time, in, bermuda, and, canada, and, pankhurst, s, death, and, funeral, pankhurst, visited, north, america, in, 1916, together, with, the, former, secretary, of, state, for, serbia, edomilj, mijatovi, whose, nation, had, been, at, the, centre, of, fighting, at, the, start, of, the, war, they, toured, the, united, states, and, canada, raising, money, and, urging, the, us, government, to, support, britain, and, its, canadian, and, other, allies, two, years, later, after, the, us, entered, the, war, pankhurst, returned, to, the, united, states, encouraging, suffragettes, there, who, had, not, suspended, their, militancy, to, support, the, war, effort, by, sidelining, activities, related, to, the, vote, she, also, spoke, about, her, fears, of, communist, insurgency, which, she, considered, a, grave, threat, to, russian, democracy, by, june, 1917, the, russian, revolution, had, strengthened, the, bolsheviks, who, urged, an, end, to, the, war, pankhurst, s, translated, autobiography, had, been, read, widely, in, russia, and, she, saw, an, opportunity, to, put, pressure, on, the, russian, people, she, hoped, to, convince, them, not, to, accept, germany, s, conditions, for, peace, which, she, saw, as, a, potential, defeat, for, britain, and, russia, uk, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, agreed, to, sponsor, her, trip, to, russia, which, she, took, in, june, she, told, one, crowd, i, came, to, petrograd, with, a, prayer, from, the, english, nation, to, the, russian, nation, that, you, may, continue, the, war, on, which, depends, the, face, of, civilisation, and, freedom, press, response, was, divided, between, left, and, right, wings, the, former, depicted, her, as, a, tool, of, capitalism, while, the, latter, praised, her, devout, patriotism, in, august, she, met, with, alexander, kerensky, the, russian, prime, minister, although, she, had, been, active, with, the, socialist, leaning, ilp, in, years, past, pankhurst, had, begun, to, see, leftist, politics, as, disagreeable, an, attitude, which, intensified, while, she, was, in, russia, the, meeting, was, uncomfortable, for, both, parties, he, felt, that, she, was, unable, to, appreciate, the, class, based, conflict, driving, russian, policy, at, the, time, he, concluded, by, telling, her, that, english, women, had, nothing, to, teach, women, in, russia, she, later, told, the, new, york, times, that, kerensky, was, the, biggest, fraud, of, modern, times, and, that, his, government, could, destroy, civilisation, when, she, returned, from, russia, pankhurst, was, delighted, to, find, that, women, s, right, to, vote, was, finally, on, its, way, to, becoming, a, reality, the, 1918, representation, of, the, people, act, removed, property, restrictions, on, men, s, suffrage, and, granted, the, vote, to, women, over, the, age, of, 30, with, several, restrictions, as, suffragists, and, suffragettes, celebrated, and, prepared, for, its, imminent, passage, a, new, schism, erupted, should, women, s, political, organisations, join, forces, with, those, established, by, men, many, socialists, and, moderates, supported, unity, of, the, sexes, in, politics, but, emmeline, and, christabel, pankhurst, saw, the, best, hope, in, remaining, separate, they, reinvented, the, wspu, as, the, women, s, party, still, open, only, to, women, women, they, said, can, best, serve, the, nation, by, keeping, clear, of, men, s, party, political, machinery, and, traditions, which, by, universal, consent, leave, so, much, to, be, desired, the, party, favoured, equal, marriage, laws, equal, pay, for, equal, work, and, equal, job, opportunities, for, women, these, were, matters, for, the, post, war, era, however, while, the, fighting, continued, the, women, s, party, demanded, no, compromise, in, the, defeat, of, germany, the, removal, from, government, of, anyone, with, family, ties, to, germany, or, pacifist, attitudes, and, shorter, work, hours, to, forestall, labour, strikes, this, last, plank, in, the, party, s, platform, was, meant, to, discourage, potential, interest, in, bolshevism, about, which, pankhurst, was, increasingly, anxious, in, the, years, after, the, 1918, armistice, pankhurst, continued, to, promote, her, nationalist, vision, of, british, unity, she, maintained, a, focus, on, women, s, empowerment, but, her, days, of, fighting, with, government, officialdom, were, over, she, defended, the, presence, and, reach, of, the, british, empire, some, talk, about, the, empire, and, imperialism, as, if, it, were, something, to, decry, and, something, to, be, ashamed, of, t, is, a, great, thing, to, be, the, inheritors, of, an, empire, like, ours, great, in, territory, great, in, potential, wealth, if, we, can, only, realise, and, use, that, potential, wealth, we, can, destroy, thereby, poverty, we, can, remove, and, destroy, ignorance, for, years, she, travelled, around, england, and, north, america, rallying, support, for, the, british, empire, and, warning, audiences, about, the, dangers, of, bolshevism, after, the, war, she, lived, in, bermuda, and, america, for, a, couple, of, years, emmeline, pankhurst, also, became, active, in, political, campaigning, again, when, a, bill, was, passed, allowing, women, to, run, for, the, house, of, commons, many, women, s, party, members, urged, pankhurst, to, stand, for, election, but, she, insisted, that, christabel, was, a, better, choice, she, campaigned, tirelessly, for, her, daughter, lobbying, prime, minister, lloyd, george, for, his, support, and, at, one, point, delivering, a, passionate, speech, in, the, rain, christabel, lost, by, a, very, slim, margin, to, the, labour, party, candidate, and, the, recount, showed, a, difference, of, 775, votes, one, biographer, called, it, the, bitterest, disappointment, of, emmeline, s, life, the, women, s, party, withered, from, existence, soon, afterward, as, a, result, of, her, many, trips, to, north, america, pankhurst, became, fond, of, canada, stating, in, an, interview, that, there, seems, to, be, more, equality, between, men, and, women, than, in, any, other, country, i, know, in, 1922, she, applied, for, canadian, permission, to, land, a, prerequisite, to, status, as, a, british, subject, with, canadian, domicile, and, rented, a, house, in, toronto, where, she, moved, with, her, four, adopted, children, she, became, active, with, the, canadian, national, council, for, combating, venereal, diseases, cnccvd, which, worked, against, the, sexual, double, standard, which, pankhurst, considered, particularly, harmful, to, women, in, many, of, her, public, lectures, across, canada, she, also, promoted, eugenic, feminist, notions, of, race, betterment, and, often, gave, speeches, together, with, emily, murphy, a, prominent, proponent, compulsory, sterilization, for, the, feeble, minded, during, a, tour, of, bathurst, the, mayor, showed, her, a, new, building, which, would, become, the, home, for, fallen, women, pankhurst, replied, ah, where, is, your, home, for, fallen, men, before, long, however, she, grew, tired, of, long, canadian, winters, and, she, ran, out, of, money, she, returned, to, england, in, late, 1925, back, in, london, emmeline, was, visited, by, sylvia, who, had, not, seen, her, mother, in, years, their, politics, were, by, now, very, different, and, sylvia, was, living, unmarried, with, an, italian, anarchist, sylvia, described, a, moment, of, familial, affection, when, they, met, followed, by, a, sad, distance, between, them, emmeline, s, adopted, daughter, mary, however, remembered, the, meeting, differently, according, to, her, version, emmeline, set, her, teacup, down, and, walked, silently, out, of, the, room, leaving, sylvia, in, tears, christabel, meanwhile, had, become, a, convert, to, adventism, and, devoted, much, of, her, time, to, the, church, the, british, press, sometimes, made, light, of, the, varied, paths, followed, by, the, once, indivisible, family, in, 1926, pankhurst, joined, the, conservative, party, and, two, years, later, ran, as, a, candidate, for, parliament, in, whitechapel, and, st, george, s, her, transformation, from, a, fiery, supporter, of, the, ilp, and, window, smashing, radical, to, an, official, conservative, party, member, surprised, many, people, she, replied, succinctly, my, war, experience, and, my, experience, on, the, other, side, of, the, atlantic, have, changed, my, views, considerably, her, biographers, insist, that, the, move, was, more, complex, she, was, devoted, to, a, programme, of, women, s, empowerment, and, anti, communism, both, the, liberal, and, labour, parties, bore, grudges, for, her, work, against, them, in, the, wspu, and, the, conservative, party, had, a, victorious, record, after, the, war, and, a, significant, majority, pankhurst, may, have, joined, the, conservative, party, as, much, to, secure, the, vote, for, women, as, from, ideological, affinity, pankhurst, s, campaign, for, parliament, was, preempted, by, her, ill, health, and, a, final, scandal, involving, sylvia, the, years, of, touring, lectures, imprisonment, and, hunger, strikes, had, taken, their, toll, fatigue, and, illness, became, a, regular, part, of, pankhurst, s, life, even, more, painful, however, was, the, news, in, april, 1928, that, sylvia, had, given, birth, out, of, wedlock, she, had, named, the, child, richard, keir, pethick, pankhurst, in, memory, of, her, father, her, ilp, comrade, and, her, colleagues, from, the, wspu, respectively, emmeline, was, further, shocked, to, see, a, report, from, a, newspaper, in, the, us, that, declared, that, miss, pankhurst, a, title, usually, reserved, for, christabel, boasted, of, her, child, being, a, triumph, of, eugenics, since, both, parents, were, healthy, and, intelligent, in, the, article, sylvia, also, spoke, of, her, belief, that, marriage, without, legal, union, was, the, most, sensible, option, for, liberated, women, these, offences, against, the, social, dignity, which, pankhurst, had, always, valued, devastated, the, elderly, woman, to, make, matters, worse, many, people, believed, the, miss, pankhurst, in, newspaper, headlines, referred, to, christabel, after, hearing, the, news, emmeline, spent, an, entire, day, crying, her, campaign, for, parliament, ended, with, the, scandal, as, her, health, deteriorated, pankhurst, moved, into, a, nursing, home, in, hampstead, she, requested, that, she, be, treated, by, the, doctor, who, attended, to, her, during, her, hunger, strikes, his, use, of, the, stomach, pump, had, helped, her, feel, better, while, in, prison, her, nurses, were, sure, that, the, shock, of, such, treatment, would, severely, wound, her, but, christabel, felt, obliged, to, carry, out, her, mother, s, request, before, the, procedure, could, be, carried, out, however, she, fell, into, a, critical, condition, from, which, none, expected, her, to, recover, on, thursday, 14, june, 1928, pankhurst, died, at, the, age, of, 69, she, was, interred, in, brompton, cemetery, in, london, news, of, emmeline, pankhurst, s, death, was, announced, around, the, country, and, extensively, in, north, america, her, funeral, service, on, 18, june, 1928, was, filled, with, her, former, wspu, colleagues, and, those, who, had, worked, beside, her, in, various, capacities, the, daily, mail, described, the, procession, as, like, a, dead, general, in, the, midst, of, a, mourning, army, women, wore, wspu, sashes, and, ribbons, and, the, organisation, s, flag, was, carried, alongside, the, union, flag, christabel, and, sylvia, appeared, together, at, the, service, the, latter, with, her, child, adela, did, not, attend, press, coverage, around, the, world, recognised, her, tireless, work, on, behalf, of, women, s, right, to, vote, even, if, they, did, not, agree, on, the, value, of, her, contributions, the, new, york, herald, tribune, called, her, the, most, remarkable, political, and, social, agitator, of, the, early, part, of, the, twentieth, century, and, the, supreme, protagonist, of, the, campaign, for, the, electoral, enfranchisement, of, women, shortly, after, the, funeral, one, of, pankhurst, s, bodyguards, from, her, wspu, days, catherine, marshall, began, raising, funds, for, a, memorial, statue, in, spring, 1930, her, efforts, bore, fruit, and, on, 6, march, her, statue, in, victoria, tower, gardens, next, to, and, gesturing, towards, the, houses, of, parliament, was, unveiled, a, crowd, of, radicals, former, suffragettes, and, national, dignitaries, gathered, as, former, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, presented, the, memorial, to, the, public, in, his, address, baldwin, declared, i, say, with, no, fear, of, contradiction, that, whatever, view, posterity, may, take, mrs, pankhurst, has, won, for, herself, a, niche, in, the, temple, of, fame, which, will, last, for, all, time, sylvia, was, the, only, pankhurst, daughter, in, attendance, christabel, touring, north, america, sent, a, telegram, which, was, read, aloud, while, planning, the, agenda, for, the, day, marshall, had, intentionally, excluded, sylvia, who, in, her, opinion, had, hastened, pankhurst, s, death, historic, england, listed, the, statue, as, grade, ii, on, 5, february, 1970, a, proposal, to, move, the, statue, of, pankhurst, away, from, the, houses, of, parliament, to, the, private, regent, s, university, london, in, regent, s, park, was, submitted, to, westminster, city, council, planning, department, in, july, 2018, by, former, conservative, mp, sir, neil, thorne, this, proposal, was, withdrawn, in, september, 2018, after, widespread, anger, and, a, public, campaign, against, it, the, planning, application, received, 896, comments, 887, of, them, objections, a, 38, degrees, petition, against, the, removal, of, the, statue, attracted, 180, 839, signatures, the, curator, s, office, at, the, palace, of, westminster, commissioned, a, report, into, the, plan, to, remove, the, statue, published, on, 22, august, 2018, it, concluded, the, memorial, to, emmeline, and, christabel, pankhurst, is, of, high, significance, which, is, not, fully, recognised, through, its, listing, at, grade, ii, an, application, has, been, made, to, historic, england, to, upgrade, the, memorial, to, grade, ii, this, is, based, on, it, having, more, than, special, interest, in, terms, of, its, unique, history, its, artistic, quality, and, the, importance, of, its, setting, next, to, the, houses, of, parliament, this, proposal, to, move, the, memorial, from, victoria, tower, gardens, to, regent, s, park, would, cause, substantial, harm, to, the, significance, of, the, memorial, as, well, has, harm, to, the, westminster, abbey, and, parliament, square, conservation, area, the, proposal, to, move, the, memorial, therefore, should, not, be, granted, planning, permission, or, listed, building, consent, during, the, twentieth, century, emmeline, pankhurst, s, value, to, the, movement, for, women, s, suffrage, was, debated, passionately, and, no, consensus, was, achieved, her, daughters, sylvia, and, christabel, weighed, in, with, books, scornful, and, laudatory, respectively, about, their, time, in, the, struggle, sylvia, s, 1931, book, the, suffrage, movement, describes, her, mother, s, political, shift, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, as, the, beginning, of, a, betrayal, of, her, family, especially, her, father, and, the, movement, it, set, the, tone, for, much, of, the, socialist, and, activist, history, written, about, the, wspu, and, particularly, solidified, emmeline, pankhurst, s, reputation, as, an, unreasonable, autocrat, christabel, s, unshackled, the, story, of, how, we, won, the, vote, released, in, 1959, paints, her, mother, as, generous, and, selfless, to, a, fault, offering, herself, completely, to, the, most, noble, causes, it, provided, a, sympathetic, counterpart, to, sylvia, s, attacks, and, continued, the, polarised, discussion, detached, and, objective, assessment, has, rarely, been, a, part, of, pankhurst, scholarship, recent, biographies, show, that, historians, differ, about, whether, emmeline, pankhurst, s, militancy, helped, or, hurt, the, movement, however, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, wspu, raised, public, awareness, of, the, movement, in, ways, that, proved, essential, baldwin, compared, her, to, martin, luther, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, individuals, who, were, not, the, sum, total, of, the, movements, in, which, they, took, part, but, who, nevertheless, played, crucial, roles, in, struggles, of, social, and, political, reform, in, the, case, of, pankhurst, this, reform, took, place, in, both, intentional, and, unintentional, ways, by, defying, the, roles, of, wife, and, mother, as, the, docile, companion, pankhurst, helped, to, pave, the, way, for, many, future, feminists, though, some, would, later, decry, her, support, for, empire, and, endorsement, of, the, idea, of, race, betterment, in, 1987, one, of, her, homes, in, manchester, was, opened, as, the, pankhurst, centre, an, all, women, gathering, space, and, museum, in, 2002, pankhurst, was, placed, at, number, 27, in, the, bbc, s,
