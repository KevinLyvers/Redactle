uma, uk, n, shamash, has, established, an, heir, there, is, some, debate, over, whether, the, name, was, an, adopted, regnal, name, or, a, birth, name, the, reading, arru, k, n, has, been, interpreted, adjectivally, as, the, king, is, established, legitimate, expanded, as, a, phrase, arrum, ki, e, num, the, terms, pre, sargonic, and, post, sargonic, were, used, in, assyriology, based,

in, 1867, in, library, of, ashurbanipal, at, nineveh, a, contemporary, reference, to, sargon, thought, to, have, been, found, on, the, cylinder, seal, of, ibni, sharru, a, high, ranking, official, serving, under, sargon, joachim, menant, published, a, description, of, this, seal, in, 1877, reading, the, king, s, name, as, shegani, shar, lukh, and, did, not, yet, identify, it, with, sargon, the, elder, who, was, identified, with, the, old, assyrian, king, sargon, i, in, 1883, the, british, museum, acquired, the, mace, head, of, shar, gani, sharri, a, votive, gift, deposited, at, the, temple, of, shamash, in, sippar, this, shar, gani, was, identified, with, the, sargon, of, agade, of, assyrian, legend, the, identification, of, shar, gani, sharri, with, sargon, was, recognised, as, mistaken, in, the, 1910s, shar, gani, sharri, shar, kali, sharri, is, in, fact, sargon, s, great, grandson, the, successor, of, naram, sin, it, is, not, entirely, clear, whether, the, neo, assyrian, king, sargon, ii, was, directly, named, for, sargon, of, akkad, as, there, is, some, uncertainty, whether, his, name, should, be, rendered, arru, uk, n, or, as, arru, k, n, u, primary, sources, pertaining, to, sargon, are, sparse, the, main, near, contemporary, reference, is, that, in, the, various, versions, of, the, sumerian, king, list, here, sargon, is, mentioned, as, the, son, of, a, gardener, former, cup, bearer, of, ur, zababa, of, kish, he, usurped, the, kingship, from, lugal, zage, si, of, uruk, and, took, it, to, his, own, city, of, akkad, the, later, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, weidner, chronicle, has, sargon, ruling, directly, after, ur, zababa, and, does, not, mention, lugal, zage, si, various, copies, of, the, king, list, give, the, duration, of, his, reign, as, either, 40, or, 54, 56, years, only, a, few, contemporary, inscriptions, relating, to, sargon, exist, though, there, are, a, number, of, old, babylonian, period, texts, that, purport, to, be, copies, of, earlier, inscriptions, of, sargon, in, absolute, years, his, reign, would, correspond, to, c, 2334, 2279, bc, in, the, middle, chronology, his, successors, until, the, gutian, conquest, of, sumer, are, also, known, as, the, sargonic, dynasty, and, their, rule, as, the, sargonic, period, of, mesopotamian, history, foster, 1982, argued, that, the, reading, of, 55, years, as, the, duration, of, sargon, s, reign, was, in, fact, a, corruption, of, an, original, interpretation, of, 37, years, an, older, version, of, the, king, list, gives, sargon, s, reign, as, lasting, for, 40, years, thorkild, jacobsen, marked, the, clause, about, sargon, s, father, being, a, gardener, as, a, lacuna, indicating, his, uncertainty, about, its, meaning, the, claim, that, sargon, was, the, original, founder, of, akkad, has, been, called, into, question, with, the, discovery, of, an, inscription, mentioning, the, place, and, dated, to, the, first, year, of, enshakushanna, who, almost, certainly, preceded, him, the, weidner, chronicle, abc, 19, 51, states, that, it, was, sargon, who, built, babylon, in, front, of, akkad, the, chronicle, of, early, kings, abc, 20, 18, 19, likewise, states, that, late, in, his, reign, sargon, dug, up, the, soil, of, the, pit, of, babylon, and, made, a, counterpart, of, babylon, next, to, agade, van, de, mieroop, suggested, that, those, two, chronicles, may, refer, to, the, much, later, assyrian, king, sargon, ii, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, rather, than, to, sargon, of, akkad, while, various, copies, of, the, sumerian, king, list, and, later, babylonian, chronicles, credit, sargon, with, a, reign, length, ranging, from, 34, to, 56, years, dated, documents, have, been, found, for, only, four, different, year, names, of, his, actual, reign,

to, discuss, a, dream, of, sargon, s, involving, the, favor, of, the, goddess, inanna, and, the, drowning, of, ur, zababa, by, the, goddess, in, a, river, of, blood, deeply, frightened, ur, zababa,

to, slay, sargon, the, legend, breaks, off, at, this, point, presumably, the, missing, sections, described, how, sargon, becomes, king, the, part, of, the, interpretation, of, the, king, s, dream, has, parallels, to, the, biblical, story, of, joseph, the, part, about, the, letter, with, the, carrier, s, death, sentence, has, similarities, to, the, greek, story, of, bellerophon, and, the, biblical, story, of, uriah, a, neo, assyrian, text, from, the, 7th, century, bc, purporting, to, be, sargon, s, autobiography, asserts, that, the, great, king, was, the, illegitimate, son, of, a,

similarities, between, the, sargon, birth, legend, and, other, infant, birth, exposures, in, ancient, literature, including, moses, karna, and, oedipus, were, noted, by, psychoanalyst, otto, rank, in, his, 1909, book, the, myth, of, the, birth, of, the, hero, the, legend, was, also, studied, in, detail, by, brian, lewis, and, compared, with, many, different, examples, of, the, infant, birth, exposure, motif, found, in, eurasian, folktales, he, discusses, a, possible, archetype, form, giving, particular, attention, to, the, sargon, legend, and, the, account, of, the, birth, of, moses, joseph, campbell, has, also, made, such, comparisons, sargon, is, also, one, of, the, many, suggestions, for, the, identity, or, inspiration, for, the, biblical, nimrod, ewing, william, 1910,
