of, scientific, natural, history, in, germany, hildegard, s, convent, at, disibodenberg, elected, her, as, magistra, mother, superior, in, 1136, she, founded, the, monasteries, of, rupertsberg, in,

miniature, illuminations, in, the, rupertsberg, manuscript, of, her, first, work, scivias, there, are, more, surviving, chants, by, hildegard, than, by, any, other, composer, from, the, entire, middle, ages, and, she, is, one, of, the, few, known, composers, to, have, written, both, the, music, and, the, words, one, of, her, works, the, ordo, virtutum, is, an, early, example, of, liturgical, drama, and, arguably, the, oldest, surviving, morality, play, she, is, noted, for, the, invention, of, a, constructed, language, known, as, lingua, ignota, although, the, history, of, her, formal, canonization, is, complicated, regional, calendars, of, the, roman, catholic, church, have, listed, her, as, a, saint, for, centuries, on, 10, may, 2012, pope, benedict, xvi, extended, the, liturgical, cult, of, hildegard, to, the, entire, catholic, church, in, a, process, known, as, equivalent, canonization, on, 7, october, 2012, he, named, her, a, doctor, of, the, church, in, recognition, of, her, holiness, of, life, and, the, originality, of, her, teaching, hildegard, was, born, around, 1098, her, parents, were, mechtild, of, merxheim, nahet, and, hildebert, of, bermersheim, a, family, of, the, free, lower, nobility, in, the, service, of, the, count, meginhard, of, sponheim, sickly, from, birth, hildegard, is, traditionally, considered, their, youngest, and, tenth, child, although, there, are, records, of, only, seven, older, siblings, in, her, vita, hildegard, states, that, from, a, very, young, age, she, experienced, visions, from, early, childhood, long, before, she, undertook, her, public, mission, or, even, her, monastic, vows, hildegard, s, spiritual, awareness, was, grounded, in, what, she, called, the, umbra, viventis, lucis, the, reflection, of, the, living, light, her, letter, to, guibert, of, gembloux, which, she, wrote, at, the, age, of, 77, describes, her, experience, of, this, light, from, my, early, childhood, before, my, bones, nerves, and, veins, were, fully, strengthened, i, have, always, seen, this, vision, in, my, soul, even, to, the, present, time, when, i, am, more, than, seventy, years, old, in, this, vision, my, soul, as, god, would, have, it, rises, up, high, into, the, vault, of, heaven, and, into, the, changing, sky, and, spreads, itself, out, among, different, peoples, although, they, are, far, away, from, me, in, distant, lands, and, places, and, because, i, see, them, this, way, in, my, soul, i, observe, them, in, accord, with, the, shifting, of, clouds, and, other, created, things, i, do, not, hear, them, with, my, outward, ears, nor, do, i, perceive, them, by, the, thoughts, of, my, own, heart, or, by, any, combination, of, my, five, senses, but, in, my, soul, alone, while, my, outward, eyes, are, open, so, i, have, never, fallen, prey, to, ecstasy, in, the, visions, but, i, see, them, wide, awake, day, and, night, and, i, am, constantly, fettered, by, sickness, and, often, in, the, grip, of, pain, so, intense, that, it, threatens, to, kill, me, but, god, has, sustained, me, until, now, the, light, which, i, see, thus, is, not, spatial, but, it, is, far, far, brighter, than, a, cloud, which, carries, the, sun, i, can, measure, neither, height, nor, length, nor, breadth, in, it, and, i, call, it, the, reflection, of, the, living, light, and, as, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, stars, appear, in, water, so, writings, sermons, virtues, and, certain, human, actions, take, form, for, me, and, gleam, perhaps, because, of, hildegard, s, visions, or, as, a, method, of, political, positioning, or, both, hildegard, s, parents, offered, her, as, an, oblate, to, the, benedictine, monastery, at, disibodenberg, which, had, been, recently, reformed, in, the, palatinate, forest, the, date, of, hildegard, s, enclosure, at, the, monastery, is, the, subject, of, debate, her, vita, says, she, was, eight, years, old, when, she, was, professed, with, jutta, who, was, the, daughter, of, count, stephan, ii, of, sponheim, and, about, six, years, older, than, hildegard, however, jutta, s, date, of, enclosure, is, known, to, have, been, in, 1112, when, hildegard, would, have, been, 14, their, vows, were, received, by, bishop, otto, of, bamberg, on, all, saints, day, 1112, some, scholars, speculate, that, hildegard, was, placed, in, the, care, of, jutta, at, the, age, of, eight, and, that, the, two, of, them, were, then, enclosed, together, six, years, later, in, any, case, hildegard, and, jutta, were, enclosed, together, at, disibodenberg, and, formed, the, core, of, a, growing, community, of, women, attached, to, the, monastery, of, monks, named, a, frauenklause, a, type, of, female, hermitage, jutta, was, also, a, visionary, and, thus, attracted, many, followers, who, came, to, visit, her, at, the, monastery, hildegard, states, that, jutta, taught, her, to, read, and, write, but, that, she, was, unlearned, and, therefore, incapable, of, teaching, hildegard, sound, biblical, interpretation, the, written, record, of, the, life, of, jutta, indicates, that, hildegard, probably, assisted, her, in, reciting, the, psalms, working, in, the, garden, other, handiwork, and, tending, to, the, sick, this, might, have, been, a, time, when, hildegard, learned, how, to, play, the, ten, stringed, psaltery, volmar, a, frequent, visitor, may, have, taught, hildegard, simple, psalm, notation, the, time, she, studied, music, could, have, been, the, beginning, of, the, compositions, she, would, later, create, upon, jutta, s, death, in, 1136, hildegard, was, unanimously, elected, as, magistra, of, the, community, by, her, fellow, nuns, abbot, kuno, of, disibodenberg, asked, hildegard, to, be, prioress, which, would, be, under, his, authority, hildegard, however, wanted, more, independence, for, herself, and, her, nuns, and, asked, abbot, kuno, to, allow, them, to, move, to, rupertsberg, this, was, to, be, a, move, toward, poverty, from, a, stone, complex, that, was, well, established, to, a, temporary, dwelling, place, when, the, abbot, declined, hildegard, s, proposition, hildegard, went, over, his, head, and, received, the, approval, of, archbishop, henry, i, of, mainz, abbot, kuno, did, not, relent, however, until, hildegard, was, stricken, by, an, illness, that, rendered, her, paralyzed, and, unable, to, move, from, her, bed, an, event, that, she, attributed, to, god, s, unhappiness, at, her, not, following, his, orders, to, move, her, nuns, to, rupertsberg, it, was, only, when, the, abbot, himself, could, not, move, hildegard, that, he, decided, to, grant, the, nuns, their, own, monastery, hildegard, and, approximately, 20, nuns, thus, moved, to, the, st, rupertsberg, monastery, in, 1150, where, volmar, served, as, provost, as, well, as, hildegard, s, confessor, and, scribe, in, 1165, hildegard, founded, a, second, monastery, for, her, nuns, at, eibingen, before, hildegard, s, death, in, 1179, a, problem, arose, with, the, clergy, of, mainz, a, man, buried, in, rupertsberg, had, died, after, excommunication, from, the, catholic, church, therefore, the, clergy, wanted, to, remove, his, body, from, the, sacred, ground, hildegard, did, not, accept, this, idea, replying, that, it, was, a, sin, and, that, the, man, had, been, reconciled, to, the, church, at, the, time, of, his, death, hildegard, said, that, she, first, saw, the, shade, of, the, living, light, at, the, age, of, three, and, by, the, age, of, five, she, began, to, understand, that, she, was, experiencing, visions, she, used, the, term, visio, latin, for, vision, to, describe, this, feature, of, her, experience, and, she, recognized, that, it, was, a, gift, that, she, could, not, explain, to, others, hildegard, explained, that, she, saw, all, things, in, the, light, of, god, through, the, five, senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and, touch, hildegard, was, hesitant, to, share, her, visions, confiding, only, to, jutta, who, in, turn, told, volmar, hildegard, s, tutor, and, later, secretary, throughout, her, life, she, continued, to, have, many, visions, and, in, 1141, at, the, age, of, 42, hildegard, received, a, vision, she, believed, to, be, an, instruction, from, god, to, write, down, that, which, you, see, and, hear, still, hesitant, to, record, her, visions, hildegard, became, physically, ill, the, illustrations, recorded, in, the, book, of, scivias, were, visions, that, hildegard, experienced, causing, her, great, suffering, and, tribulations, in, her, first, theological, text, scivias, know, the, ways, hildegard, describes, her, struggle, within, but, i, though, i, saw, and, heard, these, things, refused, to, write, for, a, long, time, through, doubt, and, bad, opinion, and, the, diversity, of, human, words, not, with, stubbornness, but, in, the, exercise, of, humility, until, laid, low, by, the, scourge, of, god, i, fell, upon, a, bed, of, sickness, then, compelled, at, last, by, many, illnesses, and, by, the, witness, of, a, certain, noble, maiden, of, good, conduct, and, of, that, man, whom, i, had, secretly, sought, and, found, as, mentioned, above, i, set, my, hand, to, the, writing, while, i, was, doing, it, i, sensed, as, i, mentioned, before, the, deep, profundity, of, scriptural, exposition, and, raising, myself, from, illness, by, the, strength, i, received, i, brought, this, work, to, a, close, though, just, barely, in, ten, years, and, i, spoke, and, wrote, these, things, not, by, the, invention, of, my, heart, or, that, of, any, other, person, but, as, by, the, secret, mysteries, of, god, i, heard, and, received, them, in, the, heavenly, places, and, again, i, heard, a, voice, from, heaven, saying, to, me, cry, out, therefore, and, write, thus, it, was, between, november, 1147, and, february, 1148, at, the, synod, in, trier, that, pope, eugenius, heard, about, hildegard, s, writings, it, was, from, this, that, she, received, papal, approval, to, document, her, visions, as, revelations, from, the, holy, spirit, giving, her, instant, credence, on, 17, september, 1179, when, hildegard, died, her, sisters, claimed, they, saw, two, streams, of, light, appear, in, the, skies, and, cross, over, the, room, where, she, was, dying, hildegard, s, hagiography, vita, sanctae, hildegardis, was, compiled, by, the, monk, theoderic, of, echternach, after, hildegard, s, death, he, included, the, hagiographical, work, libellus, or, little, book, begun, by, godfrey, of, disibodenberg, godfrey, had, died, before, he, was, able, to, complete, his, work, guibert, of, gembloux, was, invited, to, finish, the, work, however, he, had, to, return, to, his, monastery, with, the, project, unfinished, theoderic, utilized, sources, guibert, had, left, behind, to, complete, the, vita, hildegard, s, works, include, three, great, volumes, of, visionary, theology, a, variety, of, musical, compositions, for, use, in, the, liturgy, as, well, as, the, musical, morality, play, ordo, virtutum, one, of, the, largest, bodies, of, letters, nearly, 400, to, survive, from, the, middle, ages, addressed, to, correspondents, ranging, from, popes, to, emperors, to, abbots, and, abbesses, and, including, records, of, many, of, the, sermons, she, preached, in, the, 1160s, and, 1170s, two, volumes, of, material, on, natural, medicine, and, cures, an, invented, language, called, the, lingua, ignota, unknown, language, and, various, minor, works, including, a, gospel, commentary, and, two, works, of, hagiography, several, manuscripts, of, her, works, were, produced, during, her, lifetime, including, the, illustrated, rupertsberg, manuscript, of, her, first, major, work, scivias, the, dendermonde, codex, which, contains, one, version, of, her, musical, works, and, the, ghent, manuscript, which, was, the, first, fair, copy, made, for, editing, of, her, final, theological, work, the, liber, divinorum, operum, at, the, end, of, her, life, and, probably, under, her, initial, guidance, all, of, her, works, were, edited, and, gathered, into, the, single, riesenkodex, manuscript, the, riesenkodex, manuscript, is, a, collection, of, 481, folios, of, vellum, bounded, by, wooden, boards, bound, in, pig, leather, that, measure, 45, by, 30, centimetres, 18, by, 12, in, hildegard, s, most, significant, works, were, her, three, volumes, of, visionary, theology, scivias, know, the, ways, composed, 1142, 1151, liber, vitae, meritorum, book, of, life, s, merits, or, book, of, the, rewards, of, life, composed, 1158, 1163, and, liber, divinorum, operum, book, of, divine, works, also, known, as, de, operatione, dei, on, god, s, activity, begun, around, 1163, or, 1164, and, completed, around, 1172, or, 1174, in, these, volumes, the, last, of, which, was, completed, when, she, was, well, into, her, seventies, hildegard, first, describes, each, vision, whose, details, are, often, strange, and, enigmatic, and, then, interprets, their, theological, contents, in, the, words, of, the, voice, of, the, living, light, with, permission, from, abbot, kuno, of, disibodenberg, she, began, journaling, visions, she, had, which, is, the, basis, for, scivias, scivias, is, a, contraction, of, sci, vias, domini, know, the, ways, of, the, lord, and, it, was, hildegard, s, first, major, visionary, work, and, one, of, the, biggest, milestones, in, her, life, perceiving, a, divine, command, to, write, down, what, you, see, and, hear, hildegard, began, to, record, and, interpret, her, visionary, experiences, in, total, 26, visionary, experiences, were, captured, in, this, compilation, scivias, is, structured, into, three, parts, of, unequal, length, the, first, part, six, visions, chronicles, the, order, of, god, s, creation, the, creation, and, fall, of, adam, and, eve, the, structure, of, the, universe, described, as, the, shape, of, an, egg, the, relationship, between, body, and, soul, god, s, relationship, to, his, people, through, the, synagogue, and, the, choirs, of, angels, the, second, part, seven, visions, describes, the, order, of, redemption, the, coming, of, christ, the, redeemer, the, trinity, the, church, as, the, bride, of, christ, and, the, mother, of, the, faithful, in, baptism, and, confirmation, the, orders, of, the, church, christ, s, sacrifice, on, the, cross, and, the, eucharist, and, the, fight, against, the, devil, finally, the, third, part, thirteen, visions, recapitulates, the, history, of, salvation, told, in, the, first, two, parts, symbolized, as, a, building, adorned, with, various, allegorical, figures, and, virtues, it, concludes, with, the, symphony, of, heaven, an, early, version, of, hildegard, s, musical, compositions, in, early, 1148, a, commission, was, sent, by, the, pope, to, disibodenberg, to, find, out, more, about, hildegard, and, her, writings, the, commission, found, that, the, visions, were, authentic, and, returned, to, the, pope, with, a, portion, of, the, scivias, portions, of, the, uncompleted, work, were, read, aloud, to, pope, eugenius, iii, at, the, synod, of, trier, in, 1148, after, which, he, sent, hildegard, a, letter, with, his, blessing, this, blessing, was, later, construed, as, papal, approval, for, all, of, hildegard, s, wide, ranging, theological, activities, towards, the, end, of, her, life, hildegard, commissioned, a, richly, decorated, manuscript, of, scivias, the, rupertsberg, codex, although, the, original, has, been, lost, since, its, evacuation, to, dresden, for, safekeeping, in, 1945, its, images, are, preserved, in, a, hand, painted, facsimile, from, the, 1920s, in, her, second, volume, of, visionary, theology, liber, vitae, meritorum, composed, between, 1158, and, 1163, after, she, had, moved, her, community, of, nuns, into, independence, at, the, rupertsberg, in, bingen, hildegard, tackled, the, moral, life, in, the, form, of, dramatic, confrontations, between, the, virtues, and, the, vices, she, had, already, explored, this, area, in, her, musical, morality, play, ordo, virtutum, and, the, book, of, the, rewards, of, life, takes, up, the, play, s, characteristic, themes, each, vice, although, ultimately, depicted, as, ugly, and, grotesque, nevertheless, offers, alluring, seductive, speeches, that, attempt, to, entice, the, unwary, soul, into, their, clutches, standing, in, humankind, s, defence, however, are, the, sober, voices, of, the, virtues, powerfully, confronting, every, vicious, deception, amongst, the, work, s, innovations, is, one, of, the, earliest, descriptions, of, purgatory, as, the, place, where, each, soul, would, have, to, work, off, its, debts, after, death, before, entering, heaven, hildegard, s, descriptions, of, the, possible, punishments, there, are, often, gruesome, and, grotesque, which, emphasize, the, work, s, moral, and, pastoral, purpose, as, a, practical, guide, to, the, life, of, true, penance, and, proper, virtue, hildegard, s, last, and, grandest, visionary, work, liber, divinorum, operum, had, its, genesis, in, one, of, the, few, times, she, experienced, something, like, an, ecstatic, loss, of, consciousness, as, she, described, it, in, an, autobiographical, passage, included, in, her, vita, sometime, in, about, 1163, she, received, an, extraordinary, mystical, vision, in, which, was, revealed, the, sprinkling, drops, of, sweet, rain, that, she, stated, john, the, evangelist, experienced, when, he, wrote, in, the, beginning, was, the, word, john, 1, 1, hildegard, perceived, that, this, word, was, the, key, to, the, work, of, god, of, which, humankind, is, the, pinnacle, the, book, of, divine, works, therefore, became, in, many, ways, an, extended, explication, of, the, prologue, to, the, gospel, of, john, the, ten, visions, of, this, work, s, three, parts, are, cosmic, in, scale, to, illustrate, various, ways, of, understanding, the, relationship, between, god, and, his, creation, often, that, relationship, is, established, by, grand, allegorical, female, figures, representing, divine, love, caritas, or, wisdom, sapientia, the, first, vision, opens, the, work, with, a, salvo, of, poetic, and, visionary, images, swirling, about, to, characterize, god, s, dynamic, activity, within, the, scope, of, his, work, within, the, history, of, salvation, the, remaining, three, visions, of, the, first, part, introduce, the, image, of, a, human, being, standing, astride, the, spheres, that, make, up, the, universe, and, detail, the, intricate, relationships, between, the, human, as, microcosm, and, the, universe, as, macrocosm, this, culminates, in, the, final, chapter, of, part, one, vision, four, with, hildegard, s, commentary, on, the, prologue, to, the, gospel, of, john, john, 1, 1, 14, a, direct, rumination, on, the, meaning, of, in, the, beginning, was, the, word, the, single, vision, that, constitutes, the, whole, of, part, two, stretches, that, rumination, back, to, the, opening, of, genesis, and, forms, an, extended, commentary, on, the, seven, days, of, the, creation, of, the, world, told, in, genesis, 1, 2, 3, this, commentary, interprets, each, day, of, creation, in, three, ways, literal, or, cosmological, allegorical, or, ecclesiological, i, e, related, to, the, church, s, history, and, moral, or, tropological, i, e, related, to, the, soul, s, growth, in, virtue, finally, the, five, visions, of, the, third, part, take, up, again, the, building, imagery, of, scivias, to, describe, the, course, of, salvation, history, the, final, vision, 3, 5, contains, hildegard, s, longest, and, most, detailed, prophetic, program, of, the, life, of, the, church, from, her, own, days, of, womanish, weakness, through, to, the, coming, and, ultimate, downfall, of, the, antichrist, attention, in, recent, decades, to, women, of, the, medieval, catholic, church, has, led, to, a, great, deal, of, popular, interest, in, hildegard, s, music, in, addition, to, the, ordo, virtutum, 69, musical, compositions, each, with, its, own, original, poetic, text, survive, and, at, least, four, other, texts, are, known, though, their, musical, notation, has, been, lost, this, is, one, of, the, largest, repertoires, among, medieval, composers, one, of, her, better, known, works, ordo, virtutum, play, of, the, virtues, is, a, morality, play, it, is, uncertain, when, some, of, hildegard, s, compositions, were, composed, though, the, ordo, virtutum, is, thought, to, have, been, composed, as, early, as, 1151, it, is, an, independent, latin, morality, play, with, music, 82, songs, it, does, not, supplement, or, pay, homage, to, the, mass, or, the, office, of, a, certain, feast, it, is, in, fact, the, earliest, known, surviving, musical, drama, that, is, not, attached, to, a, liturgy, the, ordo, virtutum, would, have, been, performed, within, hildegard, s, monastery, by, and, for, her, select, community, of, noblewomen, and, nuns, it, was, probably, performed, as, a, manifestation, of, the, theology, hildegard, delineated, in, the, scivias, the, play, serves, as, an, allegory, of, the, christian, story, of, sin, confession, repentance, and, forgiveness, notably, it, is, the, female, virtues, who, restore, the, fallen, to, the, community, of, the, faithful, not, the, male, patriarchs, or, prophets, this, would, have, been, a, significant, message, to, the, nuns, in, hildegard, s, convent, scholars, assert, that, the, role, of, the, devil, would, have, been, played, by, volmar, while, hildegard, s, nuns, would, have, played, the, parts, of, anima, the, human, souls, and, the, virtues, the, devil, s, part, is, entirely, spoken, or, shouted, with, no, musical, setting, all, other, characters, sing, in, monophonic, plainchant, this, includes, patriarchs, prophets, a, happy, soul, an, unhappy, soul, and, a, penitent, soul, along, with, 16, virtues, including, mercy, innocence, chastity, obedience, hope, and, faith, in, addition, to, the, ordo, virtutum, hildegard, composed, many, liturgical, songs, that, were, collected, into, a, cycle, called, the, symphonia, armoniae, celestium, revelationum, the, songs, from, the, symphonia, are, set, to, hildegard, s, own, text, and, range, from, antiphons, hymns, and, sequences, such, as, columba, aspexit, to, responsories, her, music, is, monophonic, consisting, of, exactly, one, melodic, line, its, style, has, been, said, to, be, characterized, by, soaring, melodies, that, can, push, the, boundaries, of, traditional, gregorian, chant, and, to, stand, outside, the, normal, practices, of, monophonic, monastic, chant, researchers, are, also, exploring, ways, in, which, it, may, be, viewed, in, comparison, with, her, contemporaries, such, as, hermannus, contractus, another, feature, of, hildegard, s, music, that, both, reflects, the, 12th, century, evolution, of, chant, and, pushes, that, evolution, further, is, that, it, is, highly, melismatic, often, with, recurrent, melodic, units, scholars, such, as, margot, fassler, marianne, richert, pfau, and, beverly, lomer, also, note, the, intimate, relationship, between, music, and, text, in, hildegard, s, compositions, whose, rhetorical, features, are, often, more, distinct, than, is, common, in, 12th, century, chant, as, with, most, medieval, chant, notation, hildegard, s, music, lacks, any, indication, of, tempo, or, rhythm, the, surviving, manuscripts, employ, late, german, style, notation, which, uses, very, ornamental, neumes, the, reverence, for, the, virgin, mary, reflected, in, music, shows, how, deeply, influenced, and, inspired, hildegard, of, bingen, and, her, community, were, by, the, virgin, mary, and, the, saints, hildegard, s, medicinal, and, scientific, writings, although, thematically, complementary, to, her, ideas, about, nature, expressed, in, her, visionary, works, are, different, in, focus, and, scope, neither, claim, to, be, rooted, in, her, visionary, experience, and, its, divine, authority, rather, they, spring, from, her, experience, helping, in, and, then, leading, the, monastery, s, herbal, garden, and, infirmary, as, well, as, the, theoretical, information, she, likely, gained, through, her, wide, ranging, reading, in, the, monastery, s, library, as, she, gained, practical, skills, in, diagnosis, prognosis, and, treatment, she, combined, physical, treatment, of, physical, diseases, with, holistic, methods, centered, on, spiritual, healing, she, became, well, known, for, her, healing, powers, involving, the, practical, application, of, tinctures, herbs, and, precious, stones, she, combined, these, elements, with, a, theological, notion, ultimately, derived, from, genesis, all, things, put, on, earth, are, for, the, use, of, humans, in, addition, to, her, hands, on, experience, she, also, gained, medical, knowledge, including, elements, of, her, humoral, theory, from, traditional, latin, texts, hildegard, catalogued, both, her, theory, and, practice, in, two, works, the, first, physica, contains, nine, books, that, describe, the, scientific, and, medicinal, properties, of, various, plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and, animals, this, document, is, also, thought, to, contain, the, first, recorded, reference, of, the, use, of, hops, in, beer, as, a, preservative, the, second, causae, et, curae, is, an, exploration, of, the, human, body, its, connections, to, the, rest, of, the, natural, world, and, the, causes, and, cures, of, various, diseases, hildegard, documented, various, medical, practices, in, these, books, including, the, use, of, bleeding, and, home, remedies, for, many, common, ailments, she, also, explains, remedies, for, common, agricultural, injuries, such, as, burns, fractures, dislocations, and, cuts, hildegard, may, have, used, the, books, to, teach, assistants, at, the, monastery, these, books, are, historically, significant, because, they, show, areas, of, medieval, medicine, that, were, not, well, documented, because, their, practitioners, mainly, women, rarely, wrote, in, latin, her, writings, were, commentated, on, by, m, lanie, lipinska, a, polish, scientist, in, addition, to, its, wealth, of, practical, evidence, causae, et, curae, is, also, noteworthy, for, its, organizational, scheme, its, first, part, sets, the, work, within, the, context, of, the, creation, of, the, cosmos, and, then, humanity, as, its, summit, and, the, constant, interplay, of, the, human, person, as, microcosm, both, physically, and, spiritually, with, the, macrocosm, of, the, universe, informs, all, of, hildegard, s, approach, her, hallmark, is, to, emphasize, the, vital, connection, between, the, green, health, of, the, natural, world, and, the, holistic, health, of, the, human, person, viriditas, or, greening, power, was, thought, to, sustain, human, beings, and, could, be, manipulated, by, adjusting, the, balance, of, elements, within, a, person, thus, when, she, approached, medicine, as, a, type, of, gardening, it, was, not, just, as, an, analogy, rather, hildegard, understood, the, plants, and, elements, of, the, garden, as, direct, counterparts, to, the, humors, and, elements, within, the, human, body, whose, imbalance, led, to, illness, and, disease, the, nearly, three, hundred, chapters, of, the, second, book, of, causae, et, curae, explore, the, etiology, or, causes, of, disease, as, well, as, human, sexuality, psychology, and, physiology, in, this, section, she, gives, specific, instructions, for, bleeding, based, on, various, factors, including, gender, the, phase, of, the, moon, bleeding, is, best, done, when, the, moon, is, waning, the, place, of, disease, use, veins, near, diseased, organ, or, body, part, or, prevention, big, veins, in, arms, and, how, much, blood, to, take, described, in, imprecise, measurements, like, the, amount, that, a, thirsty, person, can, swallow, in, one, gulp, she, even, includes, bleeding, instructions, for, animals, to, keep, them, healthy, in, the, third, and, fourth, sections, hildegard, describes, treatments, for, malignant, and, minor, problems, and, diseases, according, to, the, humoral, theory, again, including, information, on, animal, health, the, fifth, section, is, about, diagnosis, and, prognosis, which, includes, instructions, to, check, the, patient, s, blood, pulse, urine, and, stool, finally, the, sixth, section, documents, a, lunar, horoscope, to, provide, an, additional, means, of, prognosis, for, both, disease, and, other, medical, conditions, such, as, conception, and, the, outcome, of, pregnancy, for, example, she, indicates, that, a, waxing, moon, is, good, for, human, conception, and, is, also, good, for, sowing, seeds, for, plants, sowing, seeds, is, the, plant, equivalent, of, conception, elsewhere, hildegard, is, even, said, to, have, stressed, the, value, of, boiling, drinking, water, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, infection, as, hildegard, elaborates, the, medical, and, scientific, relationship, between, the, human, microcosm, and, the, macrocosm, of, the, universe, she, often, focuses, on, interrelated, patterns, of, four, the, four, elements, fire, air, water, and, earth, the, four, seasons, the, four, humors, the, four, zones, of, the, earth, and, the, four, major, winds, although, she, inherited, the, basic, framework, of, humoral, theory, from, ancient, medicine, hildegard, s, conception, of, the, hierarchical, inter, balance, of, the, four, humors, blood, phlegm, black, bile, and, yellow, bile, was, unique, based, on, their, correspondence, to, superior, and, inferior, elements, blood, and, phlegm, corresponding, to, the, celestial, elements, of, fire, and, air, and, the, two, biles, corresponding, to, the, terrestrial, elements, of, water, and, earth, hildegard, understood, the, disease, causing, imbalance, of, these, humors, to, result, from, the, improper, dominance, of, the, subordinate, humors, this, disharmony, reflects, that, introduced, by, adam, and, eve, in, the, fall, which, for, hildegard, marked, the, indelible, entrance, of, disease, and, humoral, imbalance, into, humankind, as, she, writes, in, causae, et, curae, c, 42, it, happens, that, certain, men, suffer, diverse, illnesses, this, comes, from, the, phlegm, which, is, superabundant, within, them, for, if, man, had, remained, in, paradise, he, would, not, have, had, the, flegmata, within, his, body, from, which, many, evils, proceed, but, his, flesh, would, have, been, whole, and, without, dark, humor, however, because, he, consented, to, evil, and, relinquished, good, he, was, made, into, a, likeness, of, the, earth, which, produces, good, and, useful, herbs, as, well, as, bad, and, useless, ones, and, which, has, in, itself, both, good, and, evil, moistures, from, tasting, evil, the, blood, of, the, sons, of, adam, was, turned, into, the, poison, of, semen, out, of, which, the, sons, of, man, are, begotten, and, therefore, their, flesh, is, ulcerated, and, permeable, these, sores, and, openings, create, a, certain, storm, and, smoky, moisture, in, men, from, which, the, flegmata, arise, and, coagulate, which, then, introduce, diverse, infirmities, to, the, human, body, all, this, arose, from, the, first, evil, which, man, began, at, the, start, because, if, adam, had, remained, in, paradise, he, would, have, had, the, sweetest, health, and, the, best, dwelling, place, just, as, the, strongest, balsam, emits, the, best, odor, but, on, the, contrary, man, now, has, within, himself, poison, and, phlegm, and, diverse, illnesses, hildegard, also, invented, an, alternative, alphabet, litterae, ignotae, alternate, alphabet, was, another, work, and, was, more, or, less, a, secret, code, or, even, an, intellectual, code, much, like, a, modern, crossword, puzzle, today, hildegard, s, lingua, ignota, unknown, language, consisted, of, a, series, of, invented, words, that, corresponded, to, an, eclectic, list, of, nouns, the, list, is, approximately, 1, 000, nouns, there, are, no, other, parts, of, speech, the, two, most, important, sources, for, the, lingua, ignota, are, the, wiesbaden, hessische, landesbibliothek, 2, nicknamed, the, riesenkodex, and, the, berlin, manuscript, in, both, manuscripts, medieval, german, and, latin, glosses, are, written, above, hildegard, s, invented, words, the, berlin, manuscript, contains, additional, latin, and, german, glosses, not, found, in, the, riesenkodex, the, first, two, words, of, the, lingua, as, copied, in, the, berlin, manuscript, are, aigonz, german, goth, latin, deus, english, god, and, aleganz, german, engel, latin, angelus, english, angel, barbara, newman, believes, that, hildegard, used, her, lingua, ignota, to, increase, solidarity, among, her, nuns, sarah, higley, disagrees, and, notes, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, hildegard, teaching, the, language, to, her, nuns, she, suggests, that, the, language, was, not, intended, to, remain, a, secret, rather, the, presence, of, words, for, mundane, things, may, indicate, that, the, language, was, for, the, whole, abbey, and, perhaps, the, larger, monastic, world, higley, believes, that, the, lingua, is, a, linguistic, distillation, of, the, philosophy, expressed, in, her, three, prophetic, books, it, represents, the, cosmos, of, divine, and, human, creation, and, the, sins, that, flesh, is, heir, to, the, text, of, her, writing, and, compositions, reveals, hildegard, s, use, of, this, form, of, modified, medieval, latin, encompassing, many, invented, conflated, and, abridged, words, because, of, her, inventions, of, words, for, her, lyrics, and, use, of, a, constructed, script, many, conlangers, look, upon, her, as, a, medieval, precursor, maddocks, claims, that, it, is, likely, hildegard, learned, simple, latin, and, the, tenets, of, the, christian, faith, but, was, not, instructed, in, the, seven, liberal, arts, which, formed, the, basis, of, all, education, for, the, learned, classes, in, the, middle, ages, the, trivium, of, grammar, dialectic, and, rhetoric, plus, the, quadrivium, of, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and, music, the, correspondence, she, kept, with, the, outside, world, both, spiritual, and, social, transcended, the, cloister, as, a, space, of, spiritual, confinement, and, served, to, document, hildegard, s, grand, style, and, strict, formatting, of, medieval, letter, writing, contributing, to, christian, european, rhetorical, traditions, hildegard, authorized, herself, as, a, theologian, through, alternative, rhetorical, arts, hildegard, was, creative, in, her, interpretation, of, theology, she, believed, that, her, monastery, should, exclude, novices, who, were, not, from, the, nobility, because, she, did, not, want, her, community, to, be, divided, on, the, basis, of, social, status, she, also, stated, that, woman, may, be, made, from, man, but, no, man, can, be, made, without, a, woman, because, of, church, limitation, on, public, discursive, rhetoric, the, medieval, rhetorical, arts, included, preaching, letter, writing, poetry, and, the, encyclopedic, tradition, hildegard, s, participation, in, these, arts, speaks, to, her, significance, as, a, female, rhetorician, transcending, bans, on, women, s, social, participation, and, interpretation, of, scripture, the, acceptance, of, public, preaching, by, a, woman, even, a, well, connected, abbess, and, acknowledged, prophet, does, not, fit, the, stereotype, of, this, time, her, preaching, was, not, limited, to, the, monasteries, she, preached, publicly, in, 1160, in, germany, she, conducted, four, preaching, tours, throughout, germany, speaking, to, both, clergy, and, laity, in, chapter, houses, and, in, public, mainly, denouncing, clerical, corruption, and, calling, for, reform, many, abbots, and, abbesses, asked, her, for, prayers, and, opinions, on, various, matters, she, traveled, widely, during, her, four, preaching, tours, she, had, several, devoted, followers, including, guibert, of, gembloux, who, wrote, to, her, frequently, and, became, her, secretary, after, volmar, s, death, in, 1173, hildegard, also, influenced, several, monastic, women, exchanging, letters, with, elisabeth, of, sch, nau, a, nearby, visionary, hildegard, corresponded, with, popes, such, as, eugene, iii, and, anastasius, iv, statesmen, such, as, abbot, suger, german, emperors, such, as, frederick, i, barbarossa, and, other, notable, figures, such, as, bernard, of, clairvaux, who, advanced, her, work, at, the, behest, of, her, abbot, kuno, at, the, synod, of, trier, in, 1147, and, 1148, hildegard, of, bingen, s, correspondence, is, an, important, component, of, her, literary, output, hildegard, was, one, of, the, first, persons, for, whom, the, roman, canonization, process, was, officially, applied, but, the, process, took, so, long, that, four, attempts, at, canonization, were, not, completed, and, she, remained, at, the, level, of, her, beatification, her, name, was, nonetheless, included, in, the, roman, martyrology, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, up, to, the, current, 2004, edition, listing, her, as, saint, hildegard, with, her, feast, on, 17, september, which, would, eventually, be, added, to, the, general, roman, calendar, as, an, optional, memorial, numerous, popes, have, referred, to, hildegard, as, a, saint, including, pope, john, paul, ii, and, pope, benedict, xvi, hildegard, s, pilgrimage, church, in, eibingen, houses, her, relics, on, 10, may, 2012, pope, benedict, xvi, extended, the, veneration, of, saint, hildegard, to, the, entire, catholic, church, in, a, process, known, as, equivalent, canonization, thus, laying, the, groundwork, for, naming, her, a, doctor, of, the, church, on, 7, october, 2012, the, feast, of, the, holy, rosary, the, pope, named, her, a, doctor, of, the, church, he, called, hildegard, perennially, relevant, and, an, authentic, teacher, of, theology, and, a, profound, scholar, of, natural, science, and, music, hildegard, of, bingen, also, appears, in, the, calendar, of, saints, of, various, anglican, churches, such, as, that, of, the, church, of, england, in, which, she, is, commemorated, on, 17, september, in, recent, years, hildegard, has, become, of, particular, interest, to, feminist, scholars, they, note, her, reference, to, herself, as, a, member, of, the, weaker, sex, and, her, rather, constant, belittling, of, women, hildegard, frequently, referred, to, herself, as, an, unlearned, woman, completely, incapable, of, biblical, exegesis, such, a, statement, on, her, part, however, worked, slyly, to, her, advantage, because, it, made, her, statements, that, all, of, her, writings, and, music, came, from, visions, of, the, divine, more, believable, therefore, giving, hildegard, the, authority, to, speak, in, a, time, and, place, where, few, women, were, permitted, a, voice, hildegard, used, her, voice, to, amplify, the, church, s, condemnation, of, institutional, corruption, in, particular, simony, hildegard, has, also, become, a, figure, of, reverence, within, the, contemporary, new, age, movement, mostly, because, of, her, holistic, and, natural, view, of, healing, as, well, as, her, status, as, a, mystic, although, her, medical, writings, were, long, neglected, and, then, studied, without, reference, to, their, context, she, was, the, inspiration, for, dr, gottfried, hertzka, s, hildegard, medicine, and, is, the, namesake, for, june, boyce, tillman, s, hildegard, network, a, healing, center, that, focuses, on, a, holistic, approach, to, wellness, and, brings, together, people, interested, in, exploring, the, links, between, spirituality, the, arts, and, healing, her, reputation, as, a, medicinal, writer, and, healer, was, also, used, by, early, feminists, to, argue, for, women, s, rights, to, attend, medical, schools, reincarnation, of, hildegard, has, been, debated, since, 1924, when, austrian, mystic, rudolf, steiner, lectured, that, a, nun, of, her, description, was, the, past, life, of, russian, poet, philosopher, vladimir, soloviev, whose, visions, of, holy, wisdom, are, often, compared, to, hildegard, s, sophiologist, robert, powell, writes, that, hermetic, astrology, proves, the, match, while, mystical, communities, in, hildegard, s, lineage, include, that, of, artist, carl, schroeder, as, studied, by, columbia, sociologist, courtney, bender, and, supported, by, reincarnation, researchers, walter, semkiw, and, kevin, ryerson, recordings, and, performances, of, hildegard, s, music, have, gained, critical, praise, and, popularity, since, 1979, there, is, an, extensive, discography, of, her, musical, works, the, following, modern, musical, works, are, directly, linked, to, hildegard, and, her, music, or, texts, the, artwork, the, dinner, party, features, a, place, setting, for,
