the, liberal, party, parnell, s, reputation, peaked, from, 1889, to, 1890, after, letters, published, in, the, times, linking, him, to, the, phoenix, park, killings, of, 1882, were, shown, to, have, been, forged, by, richard, pigott, the, irish, parliamentary, party, split, in, 1890, following, the, revelation, of, parnell, s, long, adulterous, love, affair, which, led, to, many, british, liberals, many, of, whom, were, nonconformists, refusing, to, work, with, him, and, engendered, strong, opposition, from, catholic, bishops, he, headed, a, small, minority, faction, until, his, death, in, 1891, parnell, s, funeral, was, attended, by, 200, 000, and, the, day, of, his, death, is, still, remembered, as, ivy, day, parnell, square, and, parnell, street, in, dublin, are, named, after, him, and, he, is, celebrated, as, the, best, organiser, of, an, irish, political, party, up, to, that, time, and, one, of, the, most, formidable, figures, in, parliamentary, history, charles, stewart, parnell, was, born, in, avondale, house, county, wicklow, he, was, the, third, son, and, seventh, child, of, john, henry, parnell, 1811, 1859, a, wealthy, anglo, irish, anglican, landowner, and, his, american, wife, delia, tudor, stewart, 1816, 1898, of, bordentown, new, jersey, daughter, of, the, american, naval, hero, admiral, charles, stewart, the, stepson, of, one, of, george, washington, s, bodyguards, there, were, eleven, children, in, all, five, boys, and, six, girls, admiral, stewart, s, mother, parnell, s, great, grandmother, belonged, to, the, tudor, family, so, parnell, had, a, distant, relationship, with, the, british, royal, family, john, henry, parnell, himself, was, a, cousin, of, one, of, ireland, s, leading, aristocrats, viscount, powerscourt, and, also, the, grandson, of, a, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, in, grattan, s, parliament, sir, john, parnell, who, lost, office, in, 1799, when, he, opposed, the, act, of, union, the, parnells, of, avondale, were, descended, from, a, protestant, english, merchant, family, which, came, to, prominence, in, congleton, cheshire, early, in, the, 17th, century, where, two, generations, held, the, office, of, mayor, of, congleton, before, moving, to, ireland, the, family, produced, a, number, of, notable, figures, including, thomas, parnell, 1679, 1718, the, irish, poet, and, henry, parnell, 1st, baron, congleton, 1776, 1842, the, irish, politician, parnell, s, grandfather, william, parnell, 1780, 1821, who, inherited, the, avondale, estate, in, 1795, was, an, irish, liberal, party, mp, for, wicklow, from, 1817, to, 1820, thus, from, birth, charles, stewart, parnell, possessed, an, extraordinary, number, of, links, to, many, elements, of, society, he, was, linked, to, the, old, irish, parliamentary, tradition, via, his, great, grandfather, and, grandfather, to, the, american, war, of, independence, via, his, grandfather, to, the, war, of, 1812, where, his, grandfather, charles, stewart, 1778, 1869, had, been, awarded, a, gold, medal, by, the, united, states, congress, for, gallantry, in, the, u, s, navy, parnell, belonged, to, the, church, of, ireland, disestablished, in, 1868, its, members, mostly, unionists, though, in, later, years, he, began, to, drop, away, from, formal, church, attendance, and, he, was, connected, with, the, aristocracy, through, the, powerscourts, yet, it, was, as, a, leader, of, irish, nationalism, that, parnell, established, his, fame, parnell, s, parents, separated, when, he, was, six, and, as, a, boy, he, was, sent, to, different, schools, in, england, where, he, spent, an, unhappy, youth, his, father, died, in, 1859, and, he, inherited, the, avondale, estate, while, his, older, brother, john, inherited, another, estate, in, county, armagh, the, young, parnell, studied, at, magdalene, college, cambridge, 1865, 69, but, due, to, the, troubled, financial, circumstances, of, the, estate, he, inherited, he, was, absent, a, great, deal, and, never, completed, his, degree, in, 1871, he, joined, his, elder, brother, john, howard, parnell, 1843, 1923, who, farmed, in, alabama, later, an, irish, parnellite, mp, and, heir, to, the, avondale, estate, on, an, extended, tour, of, the, united, states, their, travels, took, them, mostly, through, the, south, and, apparently, the, brothers, neither, spent, much, time, in, centres, of, irish, immigration, nor, sought, out, irish, americans, in, 1874, he, became, high, sheriff, of, wicklow, his, home, county, in, which, he, was, also, an, officer, in, the, wicklow, militia, commissioned, as, lieutenant, 25, february, 1865, retired, 1870, he, was, noted, as, an, improving, landowner, who, played, an, important, part, in, opening, the, south, wicklow, area, to, industrialisation, his, attention, was, drawn, to, the, theme, dominating, the, irish, political, scene, of, the, mid, 1870s, isaac, butt, s, home, rule, league, formed, in, 1873, to, campaign, for, a, moderate, degree, of, self, government, it, was, in, support, of, this, movement, that, parnell, first, tried, to, stand, for, election, in, wicklow, but, as, high, sheriff, was, disqualified, he, was, unsuccessful, as, a, home, rule, candidate, in, the, 1874, county, dublin, by, election, on, 17, april, 1875, parnell, was, first, elected, to, the, house, of, commons, in, a, by, election, for, meath, as, a, home, rule, league, mp, backed, by, fenian, patrick, egan, he, replaced, the, deceased, league, mp, veteran, young, irelander, john, martin, parnell, later, sat, for, the, constituency, of, cork, city, from, 1880, until, 1891, during, his, first, year, as, an, mp, parnell, remained, a, reserved, observer, of, parliamentary, proceedings, he, first, came, to, attention, in, the, public, eye, in, 1876, when, he, claimed, in, the, house, of, commons, that, he, did, not, believe, that, any, murder, had, been, committed, by, fenians, in, manchester, that, drew, the, interest, of, the, irish, republican, brotherhood, irb, a, physical, force, irish, organisation, that, had, staged, a, rebellion, in, 1867, parnell, made, it, his, business, to, cultivate, fenian, sentiments, both, in, britain, and, ireland, and, became, associated, with, the, more, radical, wing, of, the, home, rule, league, which, included, joseph, biggar, mp, for, cavan, from, 1874, john, o, connor, power, mp, for, county, mayo, from, 1874, both, although, constitutionalists, had, links, with, the, irb, edmund, dwyer, gray, mp, for, tipperary, from, 1877, and, frank, hugh, o, donnell, mp, for, dungarvan, from, 1877, he, engaged, with, them, and, played, a, leading, role, in, a, policy, of, obstructionism, i, e, the, use, of, technical, procedures, to, disrupt, the, house, of, commons, ability, to, function, to, force, the, house, to, pay, more, attention, to, irish, issues, which, had, previously, been, ignored, obstruction, involved, giving, lengthy, speeches, which, were, largely, irrelevant, to, the, topic, at, hand, this, behaviour, was, opposed, by, the, less, aggressive, chairman, leader, of, the, home, rule, league, isaac, butt, parnell, visited, the, united, states, that, year, accompanied, by, o, connor, power, the, question, of, parnell, s, closeness, to, the, irb, and, whether, indeed, he, ever, joined, the, organisation, has, been, a, matter, of, academic, debate, for, a, century, the, evidence, suggests, that, later, following, the, signing, of, the, kilmainham, treaty, parnell, did, take, the, irb, oath, possibly, for, tactical, reasons, what, is, known, is, that, irb, involvement, in, the, league, s, sister, organisation, the, home, rule, confederation, of, great, britain, led, to, the, moderate, butt, s, ousting, from, its, presidency, even, though, he, had, founded, the, organisation, and, the, election, of, parnell, in, his, place, on, 28, august, 1877, parnell, was, a, restrained, speaker, in, the, house, of, commons, but, his, organisational, analytical, and, tactical, skills, earned, wide, praise, enabling, him, to, take, on, the, presidency, of, the, british, organisation, butt, died, in, 1879, and, was, replaced, as, chairman, of, the, home, rule, league, by, the, whig, oriented, william, shaw, shaw, s, victory, was, only, temporary, from, august, 1877, parnell, held, a, number, of, private, meetings, with, prominent, fenian, leaders, he, visited, paris, where, he, met, john, o, leary, and, j, j, o, kelly, both, of, whom, were, impressed, by, him, and, reported, positively, to, the, most, capable, and, militant, leader, of, the, american, republican, clan, na, gael, organisation, john, devoy, in, december, 1877, at, a, reception, for, michael, davitt, on, his, release, from, prison, he, met, william, carrol, who, assured, him, of, clan, na, gael, s, support, in, the, struggle, for, irish, self, government, this, led, to, a, meeting, in, march, 1878, between, influential, constitutionalists, parnell, and, frank, hugh, o, donnell, and, leading, fenians, o, kelly, o, leary, and, carroll, this, was, followed, by, a, telegram, from, john, devoy, in, october, 1878, which, offered, parnell, a, new, departure, deal, of, separating, militancy, from, the, constitutional, movement, as, a, path, to, all, ireland, self, government, under, certain, conditions, abandonment, of, a, federal, solution, in, favour, of, separatist, self, government, vigorous, agitation, in, the, land, question, on, the, basis, of, peasant, proprietorship, exclusion, of, all, sectarian, issues, collective, voting, by, party, members, and, energetic, resistance, to, coercive, legislation, parnell, preferred, to, keep, all, options, open, without, clearly, committing, himself, when, he, spoke, in, 1879, before, irish, tenant, defence, associations, at, ballinasloe, and, tralee, it, was, not, until, davitt, persuaded, him, to, address, a, second, meeting, at, westport, county, mayo, in, june, that, he, began, to, grasp, the, potential, of, the, land, reform, movement, at, a, national, level, several, approaches, were, made, which, eventually, produced, the, new, departure, of, june, 1879, endorsing, the, foregone, informal, agreement, which, asserted, an, understanding, binding, them, to, mutual, support, and, a, shared, political, agenda, in, addition, the, new, departure, endorsed, the, fenian, movement, and, its, armed, strategies, working, together, with, davitt, who, was, impressed, by, parnell, he, now, took, on, the, role, of, leader, of, the, new, departure, holding, platform, meeting, after, platform, meeting, around, the, country, throughout, the, autumn, of, 1879, he, repeated, the, message, to, tenants, after, the, long, depression, had, left, them, without, income, for, rent, you, must, show, the, landlord, that, you, intend, to, keep, a, firm, grip, on, your, homesteads, and, lands, you, must, not, allow, yourselves, be, dispossessed, as, you, were, dispossessed, in, 1847, parnell, was, elected, president, of, davitt, s, newly, founded, irish, national, land, league, in, dublin, on, 21, october, 1879, signing, a, militant, land, league, address, campaigning, for, land, reform, in, so, doing, he, linked, the, mass, movement, to, the, parliamentary, agitation, with, profound, consequences, for, both, of, them, andrew, kettle, his, right, hand, man, became, honorary, secretary, in, a, bout, of, activity, he, left, for, america, in, december, 1879, with, john, dillon, to, raise, funds, for, famine, relief, and, secure, support, for, home, rule, timothy, healy, followed, to, cope, with, the, press, and, they, collected, 70, 000, for, distress, in, ireland, during, parnell, s, highly, successful, tour, he, had, an, audience, with, american, president, rutherford, b, hayes, on, 2, february, 1880, he, addressed, the, united, states, house, of, representatives, on, the, state, of, ireland, and, spoke, in, 62, cities, in, the, united, states, and, in, canada, he, was, so, well, received, in, toronto, that, healy, dubbed, him, the, uncrowned, king, of, ireland, the, same, term, was, applied, 30, years, earlier, to, daniel, o, connell, he, strove, to, retain, fenian, support, but, insisted, when, asked, by, a, reporter, that, he, personally, could, not, join, a, secret, society, central, to, his, whole, approach, to, politics, was, ambiguity, in, that, he, allowed, his, hearers, to, remain, uncertain, during, his, tour, he, seemed, to, be, saying, that, there, were, virtually, no, limits, to, abolish, landlordism, he, asserted, would, be, to, undermine, english, misgovernment, and, he, is, alleged, to, have, added, when, we, have, undermined, english, misgovernment, we, have, paved, the, way, for, ireland, to, take, her, place, amongst, the, nations, of, the, earth, and, let, us, not, forget, that, that, is, the, ultimate, goal, at, which, all, we, irishmen, aim, none, of, us, whether, we, be, in, america, or, in, ireland, will, be, satisfied, until, we, have, destroyed, the, last, link, which, keeps, ireland, bound, to, england, his, activities, came, to, an, abrupt, end, when, the, 1880, united, kingdom, general, election, was, announced, for, april, and, he, returned, to, fight, it, the, conservatives, were, defeated, by, the, liberal, party, william, gladstone, was, again, prime, minister, sixty, three, home, rulers, were, elected, including, twenty, seven, parnell, supporters, parnell, being, returned, for, three, seats, cork, city, mayo, and, meath, he, chose, to, sit, for, the, cork, seat, his, triumph, facilitated, his, nomination, in, may, in, place, of, shaw, as, leader, of, a, new, home, rule, league, party, faced, with, a, country, on, the, brink, of, a, land, war, although, the, league, discouraged, violence, agrarian, outrages, grew, from, 863, incidents, in, 1879, to, 2, 590, in, 1880, after, evictions, increased, from, 1, 238, to, 2, 110, in, the, same, period, parnell, saw, the, need, to, replace, violent, agitation, with, country, wide, mass, meetings, and, the, application, of, davitt, s, boycott, also, as, a, means, of, achieving, his, objective, of, self, government, gladstone, was, alarmed, at, the, power, of, the, land, league, at, the, end, of, 1880, he, attempted, to, defuse, the, land, question, with, dual, ownership, in, the, land, law, ireland, act, 1881, establishing, a, land, commission, that, reduced, rents, and, enabled, some, tenants, to, buy, their, farms, these, halted, arbitrary, evictions, but, not, where, rent, was, unpaid, historian, r, f, foster, argues, that, in, the, countryside, the, land, league, reinforced, the, politicization, of, rural, catholic, nationalist, ireland, partly, by, defining, that, identity, against, urbanization, landlordism, englishness, and, implicitly, protestantism, parnell, s, own, newspaper, the, united, ireland, attacked, the, land, act, and, he, was, arrested, on, 13, october, 1881, together, with, his, party, lieutenants, william, o, brien, john, dillon, michael, davitt, and, willie, redmond, who, had, also, conducted, a, bitter, verbal, offensive, they, were, imprisoned, under, a, proclaimed, coercion, act, in, kilmainham, gaol, for, sabotaging, the, land, act, from, where, the, no, rent, manifesto, which, parnell, and, the, others, signed, was, issued, calling, for, a, national, tenant, farmer, rent, strike, the, land, league, was, suppressed, immediately, whilst, in, gaol, parnell, moved, in, april, 1882, to, make, a, deal, with, the, government, negotiated, through, captain, william, o, shea, mp, that, provided, the, government, settled, the, rent, arrears, question, allowing, 100, 000, tenants, to, appeal, for, fair, rent, before, the, land, courts, then, withdrawing, the, manifesto, and, undertaking, to, move, against, agrarian, crime, after, he, realised, militancy, would, never, win, home, rule, parnell, also, promised, to, use, his, good, offices, to, quell, the, violence, and, to, cooperate, cordially, for, the, future, with, the, liberal, party, in, forwarding, liberal, principles, and, measures, of, general, reform, his, release, on, 2, may, following, the, so, called, kilmainham, treaty, marked, a, critical, turning, point, in, the, development, of, parnell, s, leadership, when, he, returned, to, the, parameters, of, parliamentary, and, constitutional, politics, and, resulted, in, the, loss, of, support, of, devoy, s, american, irish, his, political, diplomacy, preserved, the, national, home, rule, movement, after, the, phoenix, park, killings, of, the, chief, secretary, lord, frederick, cavendish, and, his, under, secretary, t, h, burke, on, 6, may, parnell, was, shocked, to, the, extent, that, he, offered, gladstone, to, resign, his, seat, as, mp, the, militant, invincibles, responsible, fled, to, the, united, states, which, allowed, him, to, break, links, with, radical, land, leaguers, in, the, end, it, resulted, in, a, parnell, gladstone, alliance, working, closely, together, davitt, and, other, prominent, members, left, the, irb, and, many, rank, and, file, fenians, drifted, into, the, home, rule, movement, for, the, next, 20, years, the, irb, ceased, to, be, an, important, force, in, irish, politics, leaving, parnell, and, his, party, the, leaders, of, the, nationalist, movement, in, ireland, parnell, now, sought, to, use, his, experience, and, huge, support, to, advance, his, pursuit, of, home, rule, and, resurrected, the, suppressed, land, league, on, 17, october, 1882, as, the, irish, national, league, inl, it, combined, moderate, agrarianism, a, home, rule, programme, with, electoral, functions, was, hierarchical, and, autocratic, in, structure, with, parnell, wielding, immense, authority, and, direct, parliamentary, control, parliamentary, constitutionalism, was, the, future, path, the, informal, alliance, between, the, new, tightly, disciplined, inl, and, the, catholic, church, was, one, of, the, main, factors, for, the, revitalisation, of, the, national, home, rule, cause, after, 1882, parnell, saw, that, the, explicit, endorsement, of, catholicism, was, of, vital, importance, to, the, success, of, this, venture, and, worked, in, close, cooperation, with, the, catholic, hierarchy, in, consolidating, its, hold, over, the, irish, electorate, the, leaders, of, the, catholic, church, largely, recognised, the, parnellite, party, as, guardians, of, church, interests, despite, uneasiness, with, a, powerful, lay, leadership, at, the, end, of, 1885, the, highly, centralised, organisation, had, 1, 200, branches, spread, around, the, country, though, there, were, fewer, in, ulster, than, in, the, other, provinces, parnell, left, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, inl, in, the, hands, of, his, lieutenants, timothy, harrington, as, secretary, william, o, brien, editor, of, its, newspaper, united, ireland, and, tim, healy, its, continued, agrarian, agitation, led, to, the, passing, of, several, irish, land, acts, that, over, three, decades, changed, the, face, of, irish, land, ownership, replacing, large, anglo, irish, estates, with, tenant, ownership, parnell, next, turned, to, the, home, rule, league, party, of, which, he, was, to, remain, the, re, elected, leader, for, over, a, decade, spending, most, of, his, time, at, westminster, with, henry, campbell, as, his, personal, secretary, he, fundamentally, changed, the, party, replicated, the, inl, structure, within, it, and, created, a, well, organised, grassroots, structure, introduced, membership, to, replace, ad, hoc, informal, groupings, in, which, mps, with, little, commitment, to, the, party, voted, differently, on, issues, often, against, their, own, party, some, did, not, attend, the, house, of, commons, at, all, citing, expense, given, that, mps, were, unpaid, until, 1911, and, the, journey, to, westminster, was, both, costly, and, arduous, in, 1882, he, changed, his, party, s, name, to, the, irish, parliamentary, party, ipp, a, central, aspect, of, parnell, s, reforms, was, a, new, selection, procedure, to, ensure, the, professional, selection, of, party, candidates, committed, to, taking, their, seats, in, 1884, he, imposed, a, firm, party, pledge, which, obliged, party, mps, to, vote, as, a, bloc, in, parliament, on, all, occasions, the, creation, of, a, strict, party, whip, and, formal, party, structure, was, unique, in, party, politics, at, the, time, the, irish, parliamentary, party, is, generally, seen, as, the, first, modern, british, political, party, its, efficient, structure, and, control, contrasting, with, the, loose, rules, and, flexible, informality, found, in, the, main, british, parties, which, came, to, model, themselves, on, the, parnellite, model, the, representation, of, the, people, act, 1884, enlarged, the, franchise, and, the, ipp, increased, its, number, of, mps, from, 63, to, 85, in, the, 1885, election, the, changes, affected, the, nature, of, candidates, chosen, under, butt, the, party, s, mps, were, a, mixture, of, catholic, and, protestant, landlord, and, others, whig, liberal, and, conservative, often, leading, to, disagreements, in, policy, that, meant, that, mps, split, in, votes, under, parnell, the, number, of, protestant, and, landlord, mps, dwindled, as, did, the, number, of, conservatives, seeking, election, the, parliamentary, party, became, much, more, catholic, and, middle, class, with, a, large, number, of, journalists, and, lawyers, elected, and, the, disappearance, of, protestant, ascendancy, landowners, and, conservatives, from, it, parnell, s, party, emerged, swiftly, as, a, tightly, disciplined, and, on, the, whole, energetic, body, of, parliamentarians, by, 1885, he, was, leading, a, party, well, poised, for, the, next, general, election, his, statements, on, home, rule, designed, to, secure, the, widest, possible, support, speaking, in, cork, on, 21, january, 1885, he, stated, we, cannot, ask, the, british, constitution, for, more, than, the, restitution, of, grattan, s, parliament, but, no, man, has, the, right, to, fix, the, boundary, of, a, nation, no, man, has, the, right, to, say, to, his, country, thus, far, shalt, thou, go, and, no, further, and, we, have, never, attempted, to, fix, the, ne, plus, ultra, to, the, progress, of, ireland, s, nationhood, and, we, never, shall, both, british, parties, toyed, with, various, suggestions, for, greater, self, government, for, ireland, in, march, 1885, the, british, cabinet, rejected, the, proposal, of, radical, minister, joseph, chamberlain, of, democratic, county, councils, which, in, turn, would, elect, a, central, board, for, ireland, gladstone, on, the, other, hand, said, he, was, prepared, to, go, rather, further, than, the, idea, of, a, central, board, after, the, collapse, of, gladstone, s, government, in, june, 1885, parnell, urged, the,

third, reform, act, brought, about, a, hung, parliament, in, which, the, liberals, with, 335, seats, won, 86, more, than, the, conservatives, with, a, parnellite, bloc, of, 86, irish, home, rule, mps, holding, the, balance, of, power, in, the, commons, parnell, s, task, was, now, to, win, acceptance, of, the, principle, of, a, dublin, parliament, parnell, at, first, supported, a, conservative, government, they, were, still, the, smaller, party, after, the, elections, but, after, renewed, agrarian, distress, arose, when, agricultural, prices, fell, and, unrest, developed, during, 1885, lord, salisbury, s, conservative, government, announced, coercion, measures, in, january, 1886, parnell, switched, his, support, to, the, liberals, the, prospects, shocked, unionists, the, orange, order, revived, in, the, 1880s, to, oppose, the, land, league, now, openly, opposed, home, rule, on, 20, january, the, irish, unionist, party, was, established, in, dublin, by, 28, january, salisbury, s, government, had, resigned, the, liberal, party, regained, power, on, 1, february, their, leader, gladstone, influenced, by, the, status, of, norway, which, at, the, time, was, self, governing, but, under, the, swedish, crown, moving, towards, home, rule, which, gladstone, s, son, herbert, revealed, publicly, under, what, became, known, as, the, flying, of, the, hawarden, kite, the, third, gladstone, administration, paved, the, way, towards, the, generous, response, to, irish, demands, that, the, new, prime, minister, had, promised, but, was, unable, to, obtain, the, support, of, several, key, players, in, his, own, party, lord, hartington, who, had, been, liberal, leader, in, the, late, 1870s, and, was, still, the, most, likely, alternative, leader, refused, to, serve, at, all, while, joseph, chamberlain, briefly, held, office, then, resigned, when, he, saw, the, terms, of, the, proposed, bill, on, 8, april, 1886, gladstone, introduced, the, first, irish, home, rule, bill, his, object, to, establish, an, irish, legislature, although, large, imperial, issues, were, to, be, reserved, to, the, westminster, parliament, the, conservatives, now, emerged, as, enthusiastic, unionists, lord, randolph, churchill, declared, the, orange, card, is, the, one, to, play, in, the, course, of, a, long, and, fierce, debate, gladstone, made, a, remarkable, home, rule, speech, beseeching, parliament, to, pass, the, bill, however, the, split, between, pro, and, anti, home, rulers, within, the, liberal, party, caused, the, defeat, of, the, bill, on, its, second, reading, in, june, by, 341, to, 311, votes, parliament, was, dissolved, and, elections, called, with, irish, home, rule, the, central, issue, gladstone, hoped, to, repeat, his, triumph, of, 1868, when, he, fought, and, won, a, general, election, to, obtain, a, mandate, for, irish, disestablishment, which, had, been, a, major, cause, of, dispute, between, conservatives, and, liberals, since, the, 1830s, but, the, result, of, the, july, 1886, general, election, was, a, liberal, defeat, the, conservatives, and, the, liberal, unionist, party, returned, with, a, majority, of, 118, over, the, combined, gladstonian, liberals, and, parnell, s, 85, irish, party, seats, salisbury, formed, his, second, government, a, minority, conservative, government, with, liberal, unionist, support, the, liberal, split, made, the, unionists, the, liberal, unionists, sat, in, coalition, with, the, conservatives, after, 1895, and, would, eventually, merge, with, them, the, dominant, force, in, british, politics, until, 1906, with, strong, support, in, lancashire, liverpool, manchester, and, birmingham, the, fiefdom, of, its, former, mayor, joseph, chamberlain, who, as, recently, as, 1885, had, been, a, furious, enemy, of, the, conservatives, and, the, house, of, lords, where, many, whigs, sat, a, second, home, rule, bill, would, pass, the, commons, in, 1893, only, to, be, overwhelmingly, defeated, in, the, lords, parnell, next, became, the, centre, of, public, attention, when, in, march, and, april, 1887, he, found, himself, accused, by, the, british, newspaper, the, times, of, supporting, the, brutal, murders, in, may, 1882, of, the, newly, appointed, chief, secretary, for, ireland, lord, frederick, cavendish, and, the, permanent, under, secretary, thomas, henry, burke, in, dublin, s, phoenix, park, and, of, the, general, involvement, of, his, movement, with, crime, i, e, with, illegal, organisations, such, as, the, irb, letters, were, published, which, suggested, parnell, was, complicit, in, the, murders, the, most, important, one, dated, 15, may, 1882, ran, as, follows, dear, sir, i, am, not, surprised, at, your, friend, s, anger, but, he, and, you, should, know, that, to, denounce, the, murders, was, the, only, course, open, to, us, to, do, that, promptly, was, plainly, our, best, policy, but, you, can, tell, him, and, all, others, concerned, that, though, i, regret, the, accident, of, lord, frederick, cavendish, s, death, i, cannot, refuse, to, admit, that, burke, got, no, more, than, his, deserts, you, are, at, liberty, to, show, him, this, and, others, whom, you, can, trust, also, but, let, not, my, address, be, known, he, can, write, to, house, of, commons, yours, very, truly, chas, s, parnell, a, commission, of, enquiry, which, parnell, had, requested, revealed, in, february, 1889, after, 128, sessions, that, the, letters, were, a, fabrication, created, by, richard, pigott, a, disreputable, anti, parnellite, rogue, journalist, pigott, broke, down, under, cross, examination, after, the, letter, was, shown, to, be, a, forgery, by, him, with, his, characteristic, spelling, mistakes, he, fled, to, madrid, where, he, committed, suicide, parnell, was, vindicated, to, the, disappointment, of, the, tories, and, the, prime, minister, lord, salisbury, the, 35, volume, commission, report, published, in, february, 1890, did, not, clear, parnell, s, movement, of, criminal, involvement, parnell, then, took, the, times, to, court, and, the, newspaper, paid, him, 5, 000, equivalent, to, 695, 000, in, 2023, damages, in, an, out, of, court, settlement, when, parnell, entered, the, house, of, commons, on, 1, march, 1890, after, he, was, cleared, he, received, a, hero, s, reception, from, his, fellow, mps, led, by, gladstone, it, had, been, a, dangerous, crisis, in, his, career, yet, parnell, had, at, all, times, remained, calm, relaxed, and, unperturbed, which, greatly, impressed, his, political, friends, but, while, he, was, vindicated, in, triumph, links, between, the, home, rule, movement, and, militancy, had, been, established, this, he, could, have, survived, politically, were, it, not, for, the, crisis, to, follow, during, the, period, 1886, 90, parnell, continued, to, pursue, home, rule, striving, to, reassure, british, voters, that, it, would, be, no, threat, to, them, in, ireland, unionist, resistance, especially, after, the, irish, unionist, party, was, formed, became, increasingly, organised, parnell, pursued, moderate, and, conciliatory, tenant, land, purchase, and, still, hoped, to, retain, a, sizeable, landlord, support, for, home, rule, during, the, agrarian, crisis, which, intensified, in, 1886, and, launched, the, plan, of, campaign, organised, by, parnell, s, lieutenants, he, chose, in, the, interest, of, home, rule, not, to, associate, himself, with, it, all, that, remained, it, seemed, was, to, work, out, details, of, a, new, home, rule, bill, with, gladstone, they, held, two, meetings, one, in, march, 1888, and, a, second, more, significant, meeting, at, gladstone, s, home, in, hawarden, on, 18, 19, december, 1889, on, each, occasion, parnell, s, demands, were, entirely, within, the, accepted, parameters, of, liberal, thinking, gladstone, noting, that, he, was, one, of, the, best, people, he, had, known, to, deal, with, a, remarkable, transition, from, an, inmate, at, kilmainham, to, an, intimate, at, hawarden, in, just, over, seven, years, this, was, the, high, point, of, parnell, s, career, in, the, early, part, of, 1890, he, still, hoped, to, advance, the, situation, on, the, land, question, with, which, a, substantial, section, of, his, party, was, displeased, parnell, s, leadership, was, first, put, to, the, test, in, february, 1886, when, he, forced, the, candidature, of, captain, william, o, shea, who, had, negotiated, the, kilmainham, treaty, for, a, galway, by, election, parnell, rode, roughshod, over, his, lieutenants, healy, dillon, and, o, brien, who, were, not, in, favour, of, o, shea, galway, was, the, harbinger, of, the, fatal, crisis, to, come, o, shea, had, separated, from, his, wife, katharine, o, shea, sometime, around, 1875, but, would, not, divorce, her, as, she, was, expecting, a, substantial, inheritance, mrs, o, shea, acted, as, liaison, in, 1885, with, gladstone, during, proposals, for, the, first, home, rule, bill, parnell, later, took, up, residence, with, her, in, eltham, kent, in, the, summer, of, 1886, and, was, a, known, overnight, visitor, at, the, o, shea, house, in, brockley, kent, when, mrs, o, shea, s, aunt, died, in, 1889, her, money, was, left, in, trust, on, 24, december, 1889, captain, o, shea, filed, for, divorce, citing, parnell, as, co, respondent, although, the, case, did, not, come, to, trial, until, 15, november, 1890, the, two, day, trial, revealed, that, parnell, had, been, the, long, term, lover, of, mrs, o, shea, and, had, fathered, three, of, her, children, meanwhile, parnell, assured, the, irish, party, that, there, was, no, need, to, fear, the, verdict, because, he, would, be, exonerated, during, january, 1890, resolutions, of, confidence, in, his, leadership, were, passed, throughout, the, country, parnell, did, not, contest, the, divorce, action, at, a, hearing, on, 15, november, to, ensure, that, it, would, be, granted, and, he, could, marry, mrs, o, shea, so, captain, o, shea, s, allegations, went, unchallenged, a, divorce, decree, was, granted, on, 17, november, 1890, but, parnell, s, two, surviving, children, were, placed, in, o, shea, s, custody, news, of, the, long, standing, adultery, created, a, huge, public, scandal, the, irish, national, league, passed, a, resolution, to, confirm, his, leadership, the, catholic, church, hierarchy, in, ireland, was, shocked, by, parnell, s, immorality, and, feared, that, he, would, wreck, the, cause, of, home, rule, besides, the, issue, of, tolerating, immorality, the, bishops, sought, to, keep, control, of, irish, catholic, politics, and, they, no, longer, trusted, parnell, as, an, ally, the, chief, catholic, leader, archbishop, walsh, of, dublin, came, under, heavy, pressure, from, politicians, his, fellow, bishops, and, cardinal, manning, walsh, finally, declared, against, parnell, larkin, 1961, says, for, the, first, time, in, irish, history, the, two, dominant, forces, of, nationalism, and, catholicism, came, to, a, parting, of, the, ways, in, england, one, strong, base, of, liberal, party, support, was, nonconformist, protestantism, such, as, the, methodists, the, nonconformist, conscience, rebelled, against, having, an, adulterer, play, a, major, role, in, the, liberal, party, gladstone, warned, that, if, parnell, retained, the, leadership, it, would, mean, the, loss, of, the, next, election, the, end, of, their, alliance, and, also, of, home, rule, with, parnell, obdurate, the, alliance, collapsed, in, bitterness, when, the, annual, party, leadership, election, was, held, on, 25, november, gladstone, s, threat, was, not, conveyed, to, the, members, until, after, they, had, loyally, re, elected, their, chief, in, his, office, gladstone, published, his, warning, in, a, letter, the, next, day, angry, members, demanded, a, new, meeting, and, this, was, called, for, 1, december, parnell, issued, a, manifesto, on, 29, november, saying, a, section, of, the, party, had, lost, its, independence, he, falsified, gladstone, s, terms, for, home, rule, and, said, they, were, inadequate, a, total, of, 73, members, were, present, for, the, fateful, meeting, in, committee, room, 15, at, westminster, leaders, tried, desperately, to, achieve, a, compromise, in, which, parnell, would, temporarily, withdraw, parnell, refused, he, vehemently, insisted, that, the, independence, of, the, irish, party, could, not, be, compromised, either, by, gladstone, or, by, the, catholic, hierarchy, as, chairman, he, blocked, any, motion, to, remove, him, on, 6, december, after, five, days, of, vehement, debate, a, majority, of, 44, present, led, by, justin, mccarthy, walked, out, to, found, a, new, organisation, thus, creating, rival, parnellite, and, anti, parnellite, parties, the, minority, of, 28, who, remained, true, to, their, embattled, chief, continued, in, the, irish, national, league, under, john, redmond, but, all, of, his, former, close, associates, michael, davitt, john, dillon, william, o, brien, and, timothy, healy, deserted, him, to, join, the, anti, parnellites, the, vast, majority, of, anti, parnellites, formed, the, irish, national, federation, later, led, by, john, dillon, and, supported, by, the, catholic, church, the, bitterness, of, the, split, tore, ireland, apart, and, resonated, well, into, the, next, century, parnell, soon, died, and, his, faction, dissipated, the, majority, faction, henceforth, played, only, a, minor, role, in, british, or, irish, politics, until, the, next, time, the, uk, had, a, hung, parliament, in, 1910, parnell, fought, back, desperately, despite, his, failing, health, on, 10, december, he, arrived, in, dublin, to, a, hero, s, welcome, he, and, his, followers, forcibly, seized, the, offices, of, the, party, paper, united, irishman, a, year, before, his, prestige, had, reached, new, heights, but, the, new, crisis, crippled, this, support, and, most, rural, nationalists, turned, against, him, in, the, december, north, kilkenny, by, election, he, attracted, fenian, hillside, men, to, his, side, this, ambiguity, shocked, former, adherents, who, clashed, physically, with, his, supporters, his, candidate, lost, by, almost, two, to, one, deposed, as, leader, he, fought, a, long, and, fierce, campaign, for, reinstatement, he, conducted, a, political, tour, of, ireland, to, re, establish, popular, support, in, a, north, sligo, by, election, the, defeat, of, his, candidate, by, 2, 493, votes, to, 3, 261, was, less, resounding, he, fulfilled, his, loyalty, to, katharine, when, they, married, on, 25, june, 1891, after, parnell, had, unsuccessfully, sought, a, church, wedding, on, the, same, day, the, irish, catholic, hierarchy, worried, by, the, number, of, priests, who, had, supported, him, in, north, sligo, signed, and, published, a, near, unanimous, condemnation, by, his, public, misconduct, has, utterly, disqualified, himself, to, be, leader, only, edward, o, dwyer, bishop, of, limerick, withheld, his, signature, the, parnells, took, up, residence, in, brighton, he, returned, to, fight, the, third, and, last, by, election, in, county, carlow, having, lost, the, support, of, the, freeman, s, journal, when, its, proprietor, edmund, dwyer, gray, defected, to, the, anti, parnellites, at, one, point, quicklime, was, thrown, at, his, eyes, by, a, hostile, crowd, in, castlecomer, county, kilkenny, parnell, continued, the, exhausting, campaigning, one, loss, followed, another, but, he, looked, to, the, next, general, election, in, 1892, to, restore, his, fortunes, on, 27, september, he, addressed, a, crowd, in, pouring, rain, at, creggs, subjecting, himself, to, a, severe, soaking, on, the, difficult, campaign, trail, his, health, continuously, deteriorated, furthermore, he, had, kidney, disease, parnell, fought, on, furiously, but, though, aged, just, 45, he, was, a, dying, man, he, returned, to, dublin, on, 30, september, he, died, in, his, home, at, 10, walsingham, terrace, hove, now, replaced, by, dorset, court, kingsway, on, 6, october, 1891, of, pneumonia, and, in, the, arms, of, his, wife, katharine, he, was, 45, years, of, age, at, the, time, of, his, death, though, an, anglican, his, funeral, on, 11, october, was, at, the, irish, national, nondenominational, glasnevin, cemetery, in, dublin, and, was, attended, by, more, than, 200, 000, people, his, notability, was, such, that, his, gravestone, of, unhewn, wicklow, granite, erected, in, 1940, reads, only, parnell, his, brother, john, howard, inherited, the, avondale, estate, he, found, it, heavily, mortgaged, and, eventually, sold, it, in, 1899, five, years, later, at, the, suggestion, of, horace, plunkett, it, was, purchased, by, the, state, it, is, open, to, public, view, and, is, where, the, parnell, society, holds, its, annual, august, summer, school, the, parnell, national, memorial, park, is, in, nearby, rathdrum, county, wicklow, dublin, has, locations, named, parnell, street, and, parnell, square, at, the, north, end, of, o, connell, street, stands, the, parnell, monument, this, was, planned, and, organised, by, john, redmond, who, chose, the, american, augustus, saint, gaudens, to, sculpt, the, statue, it, was, funded, by, americans, and, completed, in, 1911, art, critics, said, it, was, not, an, artistic, success, he, is, also, commemorated, on, the, first, sunday, after, the, anniversary, of, his, death, on, 6, october, known, as, ivy, day, which, originated, when, the, mourners, at, his, funeral, in, 1891, taking, their, cue, from, a, wreath, of, ivy, sent, by, a, cork, woman, as, the, best, offering, she, could, afford, took, ivy, leaves, from, the, walls, and, stuck, them, in, their, lapels, ever, after, the, ivy, leaf, became, the, parnellite, emblem, worn, by, his, followers, when, they, gathered, to, honour, their, lost, leader, since, 1991, the, centenary, of, his, death, magdalene, college, cambridge, where, parnell, studied, has, offered, the, parnell, fellowship, in, irish, studies, which, is, awarded, to, a, scholar, for, up, to, a, year, for, study, without, teaching, or, administrative, responsibilities, parnell, fellows, have, often, been, historians, but, have, spanned, a, wide, range, of, disciplines, parnell, s, personal, political, views, remained, an, enigma, an, effective, communicator, he, was, skilfully, ambivalent, and, matched, his, words, depending, on, circumstances, and, audience, but, he, would, always, first, defend, constitutionalism, on, which, basis, he, sought, to, bring, about, change, but, he, was, hampered, by, the, crimes, that, hung, around, the, land, league, and, by, the, opposition, of, landlords, against, the, attacks, on, their, property, parnell, s, personal, complexities, or, his, perception, of, a, need, for, political, expediency, to, his, goal, permitted, him, to, condone, the, radical, republican, and, atheist, charles, bradlaugh, while, he, associated, himself, with, the, hierarchy, of, the, catholic, church, parnell, was, a, close, friend, and, political, associate, of, fellow, land, reform, activist, thomas, nulty, the, roman, catholic, bishop, of, meath, until, parnell, s, divorce, crisis, in, 1889, parnell, was, linked, both, with, the, landed, aristocracy, class, and, the, irish, republican, brotherhood, irb, with, speculation, in, the, 1890s, that, he, may, have, even, joined, the, latter, organisation, historian, andrew, roberts, argues, that, he, was, sworn, into, the, irb, in, the, old, library, at, trinity, college, dublin, in, may, 1882, and, that, this, was, concealed, for, 40, years, in, barry, o, brien, s, parnell, x, fenian, parliamentarian, john, o, connor, power, relates, and, in, fact, i, was, about, this, time, deputed, to, ask, parnell, to, join, us, i, did, ask, him, he, said, no, without, a, moment, s, hesitation, on, 24, september, 1877, parnell, told, his, constituents, that, no, amount, of, eloquence, could, achieve, what, the, fear, of, an, impending, insurrection, what, the, clerkenwell, explosion, and, the, shot, in, the, police, van, had, achieved, parnell, also, attributed, the, explosion, and, the, manchester, martyrs, incident, as, leading, to, some, measure, of, protection, being, given, to, the, irish, tenant, and, the, church, of, ireland, being, disestablished, and, disendowed, speaking, in, the, house, of, commons, parnell, told, the, house, i, wish, to, say, as, directly, as, i, can, that, i, do, not, believe, and, never, shall, believe, that, any, murder, was, committed, in, manchester, parnell, was, conservative, by, nature, which, leads, some, historians, to, suggest, that, personally, he, would, have, been, closer, to, the, conservative, party, rather, than, the, liberal, party, but, for, political, needs, andrew, kettle, parnell, s, right, hand, man, who, shared, many, of, his, opinions, wrote, of, his, own, views, i, confess, that, i, felt, and, still, feel, a, greater, leaning, towards, the, british, tory, party, than, i, ever, could, have, towards, the, so, called, liberals, in, later, years, the, double, effect, of, the, phoenix, park, trauma, and, the, o, shea, affair, reinforced, the, conservative, side, of, his, nature, charles, stewart, parnell, possessed, the, remarkable, attribute, of, charisma, was, an, enigmatic, personality, and, politically, gifted, and, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, figures, in, irish, and, british, politics, he, played, a, part, in, the, process, that, undermined, his, own, anglo, irish, caste, within, two, decades, absentee, landlords, were, almost, unknown, in, ireland, he, created, single, handedly, in, the, irish, party, britain, s, first, modern, disciplined, political, party, machine, he, held, all, the, reins, of, irish, nationalism, and, also, harnessed, irish, america, to, finance, the, cause, he, played, an, important, role, in, the, rise, and, fall, of, british, governments, in, the, mid, 1880s, and, in, gladstone, s, conversion, to, irish, home, rule, over, a, century, after, his, death, he, is, still, surrounded, by, public, interest, his, death, and, the, divorce, upheaval, which, preceded, it, gave, him, a, public, appeal, and, interest, that, other, contemporaries, such, as, timothy, healy, or, john, dillon, could, not, match, his, leading, biographer, f, s, l, lyons, says, historians, emphasise, numerous, major, achievements, above, all, there, is, the, emphasis, on, constitutional, action, as, historians, point, to, the, land, act, of, 1881, the, creation, of, the, powerful, third, force, in, parliament, using, a, highly, disciplined, party, that, he, controlled, the, inclusion, of, ireland, in, the, reform, act, of, 1884, while, preventing, any, reduction, in, the, number, of, irish, seats, the, powerful, role, of, the, irish, national, league, and, organising, locally, especially, county, conventions, that, taught, peasants, about, democratic, self, government, forcing, home, rule, to, be, a, central, issue, in, british, politics, and, persuading, the, great, majority, of, the, liberal, party, to, adopt, his, cause, lyons, agrees, that, these, were, remarkable, achievements, but, emphasises, that, parnell, did, not, accomplish, them, alone, but, only, in, close, coordination, with, men, such, as, gladstone, and, davitt, gladstone, described, him, parnell, was, the, most, remarkable, man, i, ever, met, i, do, not, say, the, ablest, man, i, say, the, most, remarkable, and, the, most, interesting, he, was, an, intellectual, phenomenon, liberal, leader, h, h, asquith, called, him, one, of, the, three, or, four, greatest, men, of, the, 19th, century, while, lord, haldane, described, him, as, the, strongest, man, the, house, of, commons, had, seen, in, 150, years, historian, a, j, p, taylor, says, more, than, any, other, man, he, gave, ireland, the, sense, of, being, an, independent, nation, lyons, points, up, the, dark, side, as, well, the, decade, long, liaison, with, mrs, o, shea, was, a, disaster, waiting, to, happen, and, parnell, had, made, no, preparations, for, it, he, waited, so, long, because, of, money, there, was, an, expectation, that, mrs, o, shea, would, receive, a, large, inheritance, from, her, elderly, aunt, who, might, have, changed, her, will, if, she, had, known, about, the, affair, in, the, aftermath, of, the, divorce, he, fought, violently, to, retain, control,
