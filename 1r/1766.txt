sir, charles, algernon, parsons, om, kcb, frs, 13, june, 1854, 11, february, 1931, was, an, english, marine, engineer, best, known, for, his, invention, of, the, compound, steam, turbine, and, as, the, eponym, of, c, a, parsons, and, company, he, worked, as, an, engineer, on, dynamo, and, turbine, design, and, power, generation, with, great, influence, on, the, naval, and, electrical, engineering, fields, he, also, developed, optical, equipment, for, searchlights, and, telescopes, parsons, was, born, into, an, anglo, irish, family, on, 13, june, 1854, in, london, as, the, youngest, son, of, the, famous, astronomer, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, the, family, seat, is, birr, castle, county, offaly, ireland, and, the, town, of, birr, was, called, parsonstown, after, the, family, from, 1620, to, 1901, with, his, three, brothers, parsons, was, educated, at, home, in, ireland, by, private, tutors, including, john, purser, all, of, whom, were, well, versed, in, the, sciences, and, also, acted, as, practical, assistants, to, the, earl, in, his, astronomical, work, one, of, them, later, became, as, sir, robert, ball, royal, astronomer, of, ireland, parsons, then, read, mathematics, at, trinity, college, dublin, and, at, st, john, s, college, cambridge, graduating, from, the, latter, in, 1877, with, a, first, class, honours, degree, he, joined, the, newcastle, based, engineering, firm, of, w, g, armstrong, as, an, apprentice, an, unusual, step, for, the, son, of, an, earl, later, he, moved, to, kitsons, in, leeds, where, he, worked, on, rocket, powered, torpedoes, in, 1884, parsons, moved, to, clarke, chapman, and, co, ship, engine, manufacturers, operating, near, newcastle, where, he, became, head, of, their, electrical, equipment, development, he, used, regnault, s, large, collection, of, steam, properties, data, of, the, physicists, to, develop, a, turbine, engine, turning, at, 18, 000, rpm, in, 1884, and, immediately, utilised, the, new, engine, to, drive, an, electrical, generator, which, he, also, designed, parsons, steam, turbine, made, cheap, and, plentiful, electricity, possible, and, revolutionised, marine, transport, and, naval, warfare, another, type, of, steam, turbine, at, the, time, invented, by, gustaf, de, laval, 1845, 1913, in, the, 1880s, was, an, impulse, design, that, subjected, the, mechanism, to, huge, centrifugal, forces, and, so, had, limited, output, due, to, the, weakness, of, the, materials, available, parsons, explained, in, his, 1911, rede, lecture, that, his, appreciation, of, the, scaling, issue, led, to, his, 1884, breakthrough, on, the, compound, steam, turbine, it, seemed, to, me, that, moderate, surface, velocities, and, speeds, of, rotation, were, essential, if, the, turbine, motor, was, to, receive, general, acceptance, as, a, prime, mover, i, therefore, decided, to, split, up, the, fall, in, pressure, of, the, steam, into, small, fractional, expansions, over, a, large, number, of, turbines, in, series, so, that, the, velocity, of, the, steam, nowhere, should, be, great, i, was, also, anxious, to, avoid, the, well, known, cutting, action, on, metal, of, steam, at, high, velocity, in, 1889, he, founded, c, a, parsons, and, company, in, newcastle, to, produce, turbo, generators, to, his, design, in, the, same, year, he, set, up, the, newcastle, and, district, electric, lighting, company, disco, in, 1890, disco, opened, forth, banks, power, station, the, first, power, station, in, the, world, to, generate, electricity, using, turbo, generators, in, 1894, he, regained, certain, patent, rights, from, clarke, chapman, although, his, first, turbine, was, only, 1, 6, efficient, and, generated, a, mere, 7, 5, kilowatts, rapid, incremental, improvements, in, a, few, years, led, to, his, first, megawatt, turbine, built, in, 1899, for, a, generating, plant, at, elberfeld, in, the, german, empire, also, interested, in, marine, applications, parsons, founded, the, parsons, marine, steam, turbine, company, in, newcastle, famously, in, june, 1897, his, turbine, powered, yacht, turbinia, turned, up, unannounced, at, the, navy, review, for, the, diamond, jubilee, of, queen, victoria, at, spithead, on, 26, june, 1897, in, front, of, the, prince, of, wales, foreign, dignitaries, and, lords, of, the, admiralty, moving, at, speed, at, queen, victoria, s, diamond, jubilee, fleet, review, off, portsmouth, to, demonstrate, the, great, potential, of, the, new, technology, the, turbinia, moved, at, 34, kn, 63, km, h, 39, mph, the, fastest, royal, navy, ships, using, other, technologies, reached, 27, kn, 50, km, h, 31, mph, part, of, the, speed, improvement, came, from, the, slender, hull, of, the, turbinia, within, two, years, the, destroyers, hms, viper, and, cobra, were, launched, with, parsons, turbines, soon, followed, by, the, first, turbine, powered, passenger, ship, clyde, steamer, ts, king, edward, in, 1901, the, first, turbine, transatlantic, liners, rms, victorian, and, virginian, in, 1905, and, the, first, turbine, powered, battleship, hms, dreadnought, in, 1906, all, of, them, driven, by, parsons, turbine, engines, as, of, 2012, turbinia, is, housed, in, a, purpose, built, gallery, at, the, discovery, museum, newcastle, parsons, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, june, 1898, received, their, rumford, medal, in, 1902, and, their, copley, medal, in, 1928, and, delivered, their, bakerian, lecture, in, 1918, he, served, as, the, president, of, the, british, association, from, 1916, to, 1919, he, was, an, invited, speaker, of, the, icm, in, 1924, at, toronto, knighted, in, 1911, he, became, a, member, of, the, order, of, merit, in, 1927, in, 1929, the, iron, and, steel, institute, awarded, him, the, bessemer, gold, medal, the, parsons, turbine, company, survives, in, the, heaton, area, of, newcastle, as, part, of, siemens, a, german, conglomerate, in, 1925, charles, parsons, acquired, the, grubb, telescope, company, and, renamed, it, grubb, parsons, that, company, survived, in, the, newcastle, area, until, 1985, parsons, also, designed, the, auxetophone, an, early, compressed, air, gramophone, in, 1883, parsons, married, katharine, bethell, the, daughter, of, william, f, bethell, they, had, two, children, the, engineer, and, campaigner, rachel, mary, parsons, b, 1885, and, algernon, george, tommy, parsons, b, 1886, who, was, killed, in, action, during, world, war, i, in, 1918, aged, 31, they, had, a, london, home, at, 1, upper, brook, street, mayfair, from, 1918, to,

manslaughter, in, 1919, katharine, and, her, daughter, rachel, co, founded, the, women, s, engineering, society, with, eleanor, shelley, rolls, margaret, lady, moir, laura, annie, willson, margaret, rowbotham, and, janetta, mary, ornsby, which, is, still, in, existence, today, sir, charles, was, initially, a, supportive, member, of, the, organisation, until, his, wife, s, resignation, parsons, ancestral, home, at, birr, castle, in, ireland, houses, a, museum, detailing, the, contribution, the, parsons, family, have, made, to, the, fields, of, science, and, engineering, with, part, of, the, museum, given, over, to, the, engineering, work, of, charles, parsons, parsons, is, depicted, on, the, reverse, of, an, irish, silver, 15, euros, silver, proof, coin, that, was, struck, in, 2017, the, irish, academy, of, engineering, awards, the, parsons, medal, named, after, charles, parsons, every, year, to, an, engineer, who, has, made, an, exceptional, contribution, to, the, practice, of, engineering, previous, winners, include, prof, tony, fagan, 2016, dr, edmond, harty, 2017, prof, sir, john, mccanny, 2018, and, michael, mclaughlin, 2019
