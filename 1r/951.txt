although, he, was, the, first, pope, from, a, monastic, background, his, prior, political, experiences, may, have, helped, him, to, be, a, talented, administrator, during, his, papacy, his, administration, greatly, surpassed, that, of, the, emperors, in, improving, the, welfare, of, the, people, of, rome, gregory, regained, papal, authority, in, spain, and, france, and, sent,

throughout, the, middle, ages, he, was, known, as, the, father, of, christian, worship, because, of, his, exceptional, efforts, in, revising, the, roman, worship, of, his, day, his, contributions, to, the, development, of, the, divine, liturgy, of, the, presanctified, gifts, still, in, use, in, the, byzantine, rite, were, so, significant, that, he, is, generally, recognized, as, its, de, facto,

of, s, gregory, is, a, greek, name, which, signifies, in, the, latin, tongue, vigilantius, that, is, in, english, watchful, the, medieval, writer, who, provided, this, etymology, did, not, hesitate, to, apply, it, to, the, life, of, gregory, lfric, states, he, was, very, diligent, in, god, s, commandments, gregory, was, born, into, a, wealthy, noble, roman, family, with, close, connections, to, the, church, his, father, gordianus, a, patrician, who, served, as, a, senator, and, for, a, time, was, the, prefect, of, the, city, of, rome, also, held, the, position, of, regionarius, in, the,

now, the, via, di, san, gregorio, it, branched, from, the, road, having, the, former, palaces, of, the, roman, emperors, on, the, palatine, hill, opposite, the, north, of, the, street, runs, into, the, colosseum, the, south, the, circus, maximus, in, gregory, s, day, the, ancient, buildings, were, in, ruins, and, were, privately, owned, villas, covered, the, area, gregory, s, family, also, owned, working, estates, in, sicily, and, around, rome, gregory, later, had, portraits, of, his, parents, frescoed, in, their, former, home, on, the, caelian, and, these, were, described, 300, years, later, by, john, the, deacon, gordianus, was, tall, with, a, long, face, and, light, eyes, he, wore, a, beard, silvia, was, tall, had, a, round, face, blue, eyes, and, a, cheerful, look, they, had, another, son, whose, name, and, fate, are, unknown, gregory, was, born, into, a, period, of, upheaval, in, italy, from, 542, the, so, called, plague, of, justinian, swept, through, the, provinces, of, the, empire, including, italy, the, plague, caused, famine, panic, and, sometimes, rioting, in, some, parts, of, the, country, over, a, third, of, the, population, was, wiped, out, or, destroyed, with, heavy, spiritual, and, emotional, effects, on, the, people, of, the, empire, politically, although, the, western, roman, empire, had, long, since, vanished, in, favor, of, the, gothic, kings, of, italy, during, the, 540s, italy, was, gradually, retaken, from, the, goths, by, justinian, i, emperor, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, ruling, from, constantinople, as, the, fighting, was, mainly, in, the, north, the, young, gregory, probably, saw, little, of, it, totila, sacked, and, vacated, rome, in, 546, destroying, most, of, its, population, but, in, 549, he, invited, those, who, were, still, alive, to, return, to, the, empty, and, ruined, streets, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, young, gregory, and, his, parents, retired, during, that, intermission, to, their, sicilian, estates, to, return, in, 549, the, war, was, over, in, rome, by, 552, and, a, subsequent, invasion, of, the, franks, was, defeated, in, 554, like, most, young, men, of, his, position, in, roman, society, gregory, was, well, educated, learning, grammar, rhetoric, the, sciences, literature, and, law, he, excelled, in, all, these, fields, gregory, of, tours, reported, that, in, grammar, dialectic, and, rhetoric, he, was, second, to, none, he, wrote, correct, latin, but, did, not, read, or, write, greek, he, knew, latin, authors, natural, science, history, mathematics, and, music, and, had, such, a, fluency, with, imperial, law, that, he, may, have, trained, in, it, as, a, preparation, for, a, career, in, public, life, indeed, he, became, a, government, official, advancing, quickly, in, rank, to, become, like, his, father, prefect, of, rome, the, highest, civil, office, in, the, city, when, only, thirty, three, years, old, the, monks, of, the, monastery, of, st, andrew, established, by, gregory, at, the, ancestral, home, on, the, caelian, had, a, portrait, of, him, made, after, his, death, which, john, the, deacon, also, saw, in, the, 9th, century, he, reports, the, picture, of, a, man, who, was, rather, bald, and, had, a, tawny, beard, like, his, father, s, and, a, face, that, was, intermediate, in, shape, between, his, mother, s, and, father, s, the, hair, that, he, had, on, the, sides, was, long, and, carefully, curled, his, nose, was, thin, and, straight, and, slightly, aquiline, his, forehead, was, high, he, had, thick, subdivided, lips, and, a, chin, of, a, comely, prominence, and, beautiful, hands, in, the, modern, era, gregory, is, often, depicted, as, a, man, at, the, border, poised, between, the, roman, and, germanic, worlds, between, east, and, west, and, above, all, perhaps, between, the, ancient, and, medieval, epochs, on, his, father, s, death, gregory, converted, his, family, villa, into, a, monastery, dedicated, to, andrew, the, apostle, after, his, death, it, was, rededicated, as, san, gregorio, magno, al, celio, in, his, life, of, contemplation, gregory, concluded, that, in, that, silence, of, the, heart, while, we, keep, watch, within, through, contemplation, we, are, as, if, asleep, to, all, things, that, are, without, gregory, had, a, deep, respect, for, the, monastic, life, and, particularly, the, vow, of, poverty, thus, when, it, came, to, light, that, a, monk, lying, on, his, death, bed, had, stolen, three, gold, pieces, gregory, as, a, remedial, punishment, forced, the, monk, to, die, alone, then, threw, his, body, and, coins, on, a, manure, heap, to, rot, with, a, condemnation, take, your, money, with, you, to, perdition, gregory, believed, that, punishment, of, sins, can, begin, even, in, this, life, before, death, however, in, time, after, the, monk, s, death, gregory, had, 30, masses, offered, for, the, man, to, assist, his, soul, before, the, final, judgment, he, viewed, being, a, monk, as, the, ardent, quest, for, the, vision, of, our, creator, his, three, paternal, aunts, were, nuns, renowned, for, their, sanctity, however, after, the, eldest, two, trasilla, and, emiliana, died, after, seeing, a, vision, of, their, ancestor, pope, felix, iii, the, youngest, soon, abandoned, the, religious, life, and, married, the, steward, of, her, estate, gregory, s, response, to, this, family, scandal, was, that, many, are, called, but, few, are, chosen, gregory, s, mother, silvia, is, herself, a, saint, eventually, pope, pelagius, ii, ordained, gregory, a, deacon, and, solicited, his, help, in, trying, to, heal, the, schism, of, the, three, chapters, in, northern, italy, however, this, schism, was, not, healed, until, well, after, gregory, was, gone, in, 579, pelagius, ii, chose, gregory, as, his, apocrisiarius, ambassador, to, the, imperial, court, in, constantinople, a, post, gregory, would, hold, until, 586, gregory, was, part, of, the, roman, delegation, both, lay, and, clerical, that, arrived, in, constantinople, in, 578, to, ask, the, emperor, for, military, aid, against, the, lombards, with, the, byzantine, military, focused, on, the, east, these, entreaties, proved, unsuccessful, in, 584, pelagius, ii, wrote, to, gregory, as, apocrisiarius, detailing, the, hardships, that, rome, was, experiencing, under, the, lombards, and, asking, him, to, ask, emperor, maurice, to, send, a, relief, force, maurice, however, had, long, ago, determined, to, limit, his, efforts, against, the, lombards, to, intrigue, and, diplomacy, pitting, the, franks, against, them, it, soon, became, obvious, to, gregory, that, the, byzantine, emperors, were, unlikely, to, send, such, a, force, given, their, more, immediate, difficulties, with, the, persians, in, the, east, and, the, avars, and, slavs, to, the, north, according, to, ekonomou, if, gregory, s, principal, task, was, to, plead, rome, s, cause, before, the, emperor, there, seems, to, have, been, little, left, for, him, to, do, once, imperial, policy, toward, italy, became, evident, papal, representatives, who, pressed, their, claims, with, excessive, vigor, could, quickly, become, a, nuisance, and, find, themselves, excluded, from, the, imperial, presence, altogether, gregory, had, already, drawn, an, imperial, rebuke, for, his, lengthy, canonical, writings, on, the, subject, of, the, legitimacy, of, john, iii, scholasticus, who, had, occupied, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, for, twelve, years, prior, to, the, return, of, eutychius, who, had, been, driven, out, by, justinian, gregory, turned, to, cultivating, connections, with, the, byzantine, elite, of, the, city, where, he, became, extremely, popular, with, the, city, s, upper, class, especially, aristocratic, women, ekonomou, surmises, that, while, gregory, may, have, become, spiritual, father, to, a, large, and, important, segment, of, constantinople, s, aristocracy, this, relationship, did, not, significantly, advance, the, interests, of, rome, before, the, emperor, although, the, writings, of, john, the, deacon, claim, that, gregory, labored, diligently, for, the, relief, of, italy, there, is, no, evidence, that, his, tenure, accomplished, much, towards, any, of, the, objectives, of, pelagius, ii, gregory, s, theological, disputes, with, patriarch, eutychius, would, leave, a, bitter, taste, for, the, theological, speculation, of, the, east, with, gregory, that, continued, to, influence, him, well, into, his, own, papacy, according, to, western, sources, gregory, s, very, public, debate, with, eutychius, culminated, in, an, exchange, before, tiberius, ii, where, gregory, cited, a, biblical, passage, in, support, of, the, view, that, christ, was, corporeal, and, palpable, after, his, resurrection, allegedly, as, a, result, of, this, exchange, tiberius, ii, ordered, eutychius, s, writings, burned, ekonomou, views, this, argument, though, exaggerated, in, western, sources, as, gregory, s, one, achievement, of, an, otherwise, fruitless, apokrisiariat, in, reality, gregory, was, forced, to, rely, on, scripture, because, he, could, not, read, the, untranslated, greek, authoritative, works, gregory, left, constantinople, for, rome, in, 585, returning, to, his, monastery, on, the, caelian, hill, gregory, was, elected, by, acclamation, to, succeed, pelagius, ii, in, 590, when, the, latter, died, of, the, plague, spreading, through, the, city, gregory, was, approved, by, an, imperial, iussio, from, constantinople, the, following, september, as, was, the, norm, during, the, byzantine, papacy, in, constantinople, gregory, took, issue, with, the, aged, patriarch, eutychius, of, constantinople, who, had, recently, published, a, treatise, now, lost, on, the, general, resurrection, eutychius, maintained, that, the, resurrected, body, will, be, more, subtle, than, air, and, no, longer, palpable, gregory, opposed, and, used, the, palpability, of, the, risen, christ, in, luke, 24, 39, as, evidence, as, the, dispute, could, not, be, settled, the, byzantine, emperor, tiberius, ii, constantine, undertook, to, arbitrate, he, decided, in, favor, of, palpability, and, ordered, eutychius, book, to, be, burned, shortly, after, both, gregory, and, eutychius, became, ill, gregory, recovered, but, eutychius, died, on, 5, april, 582, at, age, 70, on, his, deathbed, eutychius, recanted, impalpability, and, gregory, dropped, the, matter, gregory, was, more, inclined, to, remain, retired, into, the, monastic, lifestyle, of, contemplation, in, texts, of, all, genres, especially, those, produced, in, his, first, year, as, pope, gregory, bemoaned, the, burden, of, office, and, mourned, the, loss, of, the, undisturbed, life, of, prayer, he, had, once, enjoyed, as, a, monk, when, he, became, pope, in, 590, among, his, first, acts, was, writing, a, series, of, letters, disavowing, any, ambition, to, the, throne, of, peter, and, praising, the, contemplative, life, of, the, monks, at, that, time, for, various, reasons, the, holy, see, had, not, exerted, effective, leadership, in, the, west, since, the, pontificate, of, gelasius, i, the, episcopacy, in, gaul, was, drawn, from, the, great, territorial, families, and, identified, with, them, the, parochial, horizon, of, gregory, s, contemporary, gregory, of, tours, may, be, considered, typical, in, visigothic, spain, the, bishops, had, little, contact, with, rome, in, italy, the, territories, which, had, de, facto, fallen, under, the, administration, of, the, papacy, were, beset, by, the, violent, lombard, dukes, and, the, rivalry, of, the, byzantines, in, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, and, in, the, south, pope, gregory, had, strong, convictions, on, missions, almighty, god, places, good, men, in, authority, that, he, may, impart, through, them, the, gifts, of, his, mercy, to, their, subjects, and, this, we, find, to, be, the, case, with, the, british, over, whom, you, have, been, appointed, to, rule, that, through, the, blessings, bestowed, on, you, the, blessings, of, heaven, might, be, bestowed, on, your, people, also, he, is, credited, with, re, energizing, the, church, s, missionary, work, among, the, non, christian, peoples, of, northern, europe, he, is, most, famous, for, sending, a, mission, often, called, the, gregorian, mission, under, augustine, of, canterbury, prior, of, saint, andrew, s, where, he, had, perhaps, succeeded, gregory, to, evangelize, the, pagan, anglo, saxons, of, britain, it, seems, that, the, pope, had, never, forgotten, the, anglo, saxon, slaves, whom, he, had, once, seen, in, the, roman, forum, the, mission, was, successful, and, it, was, from, england, that, missionaries, later, set, out, for, the, netherlands, and, germany, the, preaching, of, non, heretical, christian, faith, and, the, elimination, of, all, deviations, from, it, was, a, key, element, in, gregory, s, worldview, and, it, constituted, one, of, the, major, continuing, policies, of, his, pontificate, pope, gregory, the, great, urged, his, followers, on, the, value, of, bathing, as, a, bodily, need, it, is, said, he, was, declared, a, saint, immediately, after, his, death, by, popular, acclamation, in, his, official, documents, gregory, was, the, first, to, make, extensive, use, of, the, term, servant, of, the, servants, of, god, servus, servorum, dei, as, a, papal, title, thus, initiating, a, practice, that, was, to, be, followed, by, most, subsequent, popes, the, church, had, a, practice, from, early, times, of, passing, on, a, large, portion, of, the, donations, it, received, from, its, members, as, alms, gregory, is, known, for, his, extensive, administrative, system, of, charitable, relief, of, the, poor, at, rome, the, poor, were, predominantly, refugees, from, the, incursions, of, the, lombards, the, philosophy, under, which, he, devised, this, system, is, that, the, wealth, belonged, to, the, poor, and, the, church, was, only, its, steward, he, received, lavish, donations, from, the, wealthy, families, of, rome, who, following, his, own, example, were, eager, by, doing, so, to, expiate, their, sins, he, gave, alms, equally, as, lavishly, both, individually, and, en, masse, he, wrote, in, letters, i, have, frequently, charged, you, to, act, as, my, representative, to, relieve, the, poor, in, their, distress, and, i, hold, the, office, of, steward, to, the, property, of, the, poor, in, gregory, s, time, the, church, in, rome, received, donations, of, many, different, kinds, consumables, such, as, food, and, clothing, investment, property, real, estate, and, works, of, art, and, capital, goods, or, revenue, generating, property, such, as, the, sicilian, latifundia, or, agricultural, estates, the, church, already, had, a, system, for, circulating, the, consumables, to, the, poor, associated, with, each, of, the, main, city, churches, was, a, deacon, he, was, given, a, building, from, which, the, poor, could, apply, for, assistance, at, any, time, the, circumstances, in, which, gregory, became, pope, in, 590, were, of, ruination, the, lombards, held, the, greater, part, of, italy, their, depredations, had, brought, the, economy, to, a, standstill, they, camped, nearly, at, the, gates, of, rome, the, city, itself, was, crowded, with, refugees, from, all, walks, of, life, who, lived, in, the, streets, and, had, few, of, the, necessities, of, life, the, seat, of, government, was, far, from, rome, in, constantinople, and, appeared, unable, to, undertake, the, relief, of, italy, in, 590, gregory, could, wait, for, constantinople, no, longer, he, organized, the, resources, of, the, church, into, an, administration, for, general, relief, in, doing, so, he, evidenced, a, talent, for, and, intuitive, understanding, of, the, principles, of, accounting, which, was, not, to, be, invented, for, centuries, the, church, already, had, basic, accounting, documents, every, expense, was, recorded, in, journals, called, regesta, lists, of, amounts, recipients, and, circumstances, revenue, was, recorded, in, polyptici, books, many, of, these, polyptici, were, ledgers, recording, the, operating, expenses, of, the, church, and, the, assets, the, patrimonia, a, central, papal, administration, the, notarii, under, a, chief, the, primicerius, notariorum, kept, the, ledgers, and, issued, brevia, patrimonii, or, lists, of, property, for, which, each, rector, was, responsible, gregory, began, by, aggressively, requiring, his, churchmen, to, seek, out, and, relieve, needy, persons, and, reprimanded, them, if, they, did, not, in, a, letter, to, a, subordinate, in, sicily, he, wrote, i, asked, you, most, of, all, to, take, care, of, the, poor, and, if, you, knew, of, people, in, poverty, you, should, have, pointed, them, out, i, desire, that, you, give, the, woman, pateria, forty, solidi, for, the, children, s, shoes, and, forty, bushels, of, grain, soon, he, was, replacing, administrators, who, would, not, cooperate, with, those, who, would, and, at, the, same, time, adding, more, in, a, build, up, to, a, great, plan, that, he, had, in, mind, he, understood, that, expenses, must, be, matched, by, income, to, pay, for, his, increased, expenses, he, liquidated, the, investment, property, and, paid, the, expenses, in, cash, according, to, a, budget, recorded, in, the, polyptici, the, churchmen, were, paid, four, times, a, year, and, also, personally, given, a, golden, coin, for, their, trouble, money, however, was, no, substitute, for, food, in, a, city, that, was, on, the, brink, of, famine, the, church, now, owned, between, 1, 300, and, 1, 800, square, miles, 3, 400, and, 4, 700, km, 2, of, revenue, generating, farmland, divided, into, large, sections, called, patrimonia, it, produced, goods, of, all, kinds, which, were, sold, but, gregory, intervened, and, had, the, goods, shipped, to, rome, for, distribution, in, the, diaconia, he, gave, orders, to, step, up, production, set, quotas, and, put, an, administrative, structure, in, place, to, carry, it, out, at, the, bottom, was, the, rusticus, who, produced, the, goods, some, rustici, were, or, owned, slaves, he, turned, over, part, of, his, produce, to, a, conductor, from, whom, he, leased, the, land, the, latter, reported, to, an, actionarius, who, reported, to, a, defensor, who, reported, to, a, rector, grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish, and, oil, began, to, arrive, at, rome, in, large, quantities, where, it, was, given, away, for, nothing, as, alms, distributions, to, qualified, persons, were, monthly, however, a, certain, proportion, of, the, population, lived, in, the, streets, or, were, too, ill, or, infirm, to, pick, up, their, monthly, food, supply, to, them, gregory, sent, out, a, small, army, of, charitable, persons, mainly, monks, every, morning, with, prepared, food, it, is, said, that, he, would, not, dine, until, the, indigent, were, fed, when, he, did, dine, he, shared, the, family, table, which, he, had, saved, and, which, still, exists, with, 12, indigent, guests, to, the, needy, living, in, wealthy, homes, he, sent, meals, he, had, cooked, with, his, own, hands, as, gifts, to, spare, them, the, indignity, of, receiving, charity, hearing, of, the, death, of, an, indigent, in, a, back, room, he, was, depressed, for, days, entertaining, for, a, time, the, conceit, that, he, had, failed, in, his, duty, and, was, a, murderer, these, and, other, good, deeds, and, charitable, frame, of, mind, completely, won, the, hearts, and, minds, of, the, roman, people, they, now, looked, to, the, papacy, for, government, ignoring, the, state, at, constantinople, the, office, of, urban, prefect, went, without, candidates, john, the, deacon, wrote, that, pope, gregory, i, made, a, general, revision, of, the, liturgy, of, the, pre, tridentine, mass, removing, many, things, changing, a, few, adding, some, in, his, own, letters, gregory, remarks, that, he, moved, the, pater, noster, our, father, to, immediately, after, the, roman, canon, and, immediately, before, the, fraction, this, position, is, still, maintained, today, in, the, roman, liturgy, the, pre, gregorian, position, is, evident, in, the, ambrosian, rite, gregory, added, material, to, the, hanc, igitur, of, the, roman, canon, and, established, the, nine, kyries, a, vestigial, remnant, of, the, litany, which, was, originally, at, that, place, at, the, beginning, of, mass, he, forbade, deacons, to, perform, any, of, the, musical, portions, of, the, mass, other, than, singing, the, gospel, sacramentaries, directly, influenced, by, gregorian, reforms, are, referred, to, as, sacrementaria, gregoriana, roman, and, other, western, liturgies, since, this, era, have, a, number, of, prayers, that, change, to, reflect, the, feast, or, liturgical, season, these, variations, are, visible, in, the, collects, and, prefaces, as, well, as, in, the, roman, canon, itself, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, eastern, catholic, churches, gregory, is, credited, as, the, primary, influence, in, constructing, the, more, penitential, divine, liturgy, of, the, presanctified, gifts, a, fully, separate, form, of, the, divine, liturgy, in, the, byzantine, rite, adapted, to, the, needs, of, the, season, of, great, lent, its, roman, rite, equivalent, is, the, mass, of, the, presanctified, used, only, on, good, friday, the, syriac, liturgy, of, the, presanctified, gifts, continues, to, be, used, in, the, malankara, rite, a, variant, of, the, west, syrian, rite, historically, practiced, in, the, malankara, church, of, india, and, now, practiced, by, the, several, churches, that, descended, from, it, and, at, some, occasions, in, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, mainstream, form, of, western, plainchant, standardized, in, the, late, 9th, century, was, attributed, to, pope, gregory, i, and, so, took, the, name, of, gregorian, chant, the, earliest, such, attribution, is, in, john, the, deacon, s, 873, biography, of, gregory, almost, three, centuries, after, the, pope, s, death, and, the, chant, that, bears, his, name, is, the, result, of, the, fusion, of, roman, and, frankish, elements, which, took, place, in, the, franco, german, empire, under, pepin, charlemagne, and, their, successors, gregory, is, commonly, credited, with, founding, the, medieval, papacy, and, so, many, attribute, the, beginning, of, medieval, spirituality, to, him, gregory, is, the, only, pope, between, the, fifth, and, the, eleventh, centuries, whose, correspondence, and, writings, have, survived, enough, to, form, a, comprehensive, corpus, some, of, his, writings, are, gregory, wrote, over, 850, letters, in, the, last, 13, years, of, his, life, 590, 604, that, give, us, an, accurate, picture, of, his, work, a, truly, autobiographical, presentation, is, nearly, impossible, for, gregory, the, development, of, his, mind, and, personality, remains, purely, speculative, in, nature, opinions, of, the, writings, of, gregory, vary, his, character, strikes, us, as, an, ambiguous, and, enigmatic, one, historian, norman, cantor, observed, on, the, one, hand, he, was, an, able, and, determined, administrator, a, skilled, and, clever, diplomat, a, leader, of, the, greatest, sophistication, and, vision, but, on, the, other, hand, he, appears, in, his, writings, as, a, superstitious, and, credulous, monk, hostile, to, learning, crudely, limited, as, a, theologian, and, excessively, devoted, to, saints, miracles, and, relics, gregory, was, among, those, who, identified, mary, magdalene, with, mary, of, bethany, whom, john, 12, 1, 8, recounts, as, having, anointed, jesus, with, precious, ointment, an, event, that, some, interpret, as, being, the, same, as, the, anointing, of, jesus, performed, by, a, woman, that, luke, alone, among, the, synoptic, gospels, recounts, as, a, sinner, preaching, on, the, passage, in, the, gospel, of, luke, gregory, remarked, this, woman, whom, luke, calls, a, sinner, and, john, calls, mary, i, think, is, the, mary, from, whom, mark, reports, that, seven, demons, were, cast, out, modern, biblical, scholars, distinguish, these, as, three, separate, figures, persons, however, within, the, general, populace, they, are, still, believed, to, refer, to, the, same, person, in, art, gregory, is, usually, shown, in, full, pontifical, robes, with, the, tiara, and, double, cross, despite, his, actual, habit, of, dress, earlier, depictions, are, more, likely, to, show, a, monastic, tonsure, and, plainer, dress, orthodox, icons, traditionally, show, st, gregory, vested, as, a, bishop, holding, a, gospel, book, and, blessing, with, his, right, hand, it, is, recorded, that, he, permitted, his, depiction, with, a, square, halo, then, used, for, the, living, a, dove, is, his, attribute, from, the, well, known, story, attributed, to, his, friend, peter, the, deacon, who, tells, that, when, the, pope, was, dictating, his, homilies, on, ezechiel, a, curtain, was, drawn, between, his, secretary, and, himself, as, however, the, pope, remained, silent, for, long, periods, at, a, time, the, servant, made, a, hole, in, the, curtain, and, looking, through, beheld, a, dove, seated, upon, gregory, s, head, with, its, beak, between, his, lips, when, the, dove, withdrew, its, beak, the, pope, spoke, and, the, secretary, took, down, his, words, but, when, he, became, silent, the, servant, again, applied, his, eye, to, the, hole, and, saw, the, dove, had, replaced, its, beak, between, his, lips, ribera, s, oil, painting, of, saint, gregory, the, great, c, 1614, is, from, the, giustiniani, collection, the, painting, is, conserved, in, the, galleria, nazionale, d, arte, antica, rome, the, face, of, gregory, is, a, caricature, of, the, features, described, by, john, the, deacon, total, baldness, outthrust, chin, beak, like, nose, whereas, john, had, described, partial, baldness, a, mildly, protruding, chin, slightly, aquiline, nose, and, strikingly, good, looks, in, this, picture, also, gregory, has, his, monastic, back, on, the, world, which, the, real, gregory, despite, his, reclusive, intent, was, seldom, allowed, to, have, this, scene, is, shown, as, a, version, of, the, traditional, evangelist, portrait, where, the, evangelists, symbols, are, also, sometimes, shown, dictating, from, the, tenth, century, onwards, an, early, example, is, the, dedication, miniature, from, an, eleventh, century, manuscript, of, gregory, s, moralia, in, job, the, miniature, shows, the, scribe, bebo, of, seeon, abbey, presenting, the, manuscript, to, the, holy, roman, emperor,

the, late, medieval, subject, of, the, mass, of, st, gregory, shows, a, version, of, a, 7th, century, story, that, was, elaborated, in, later, hagiography, gregory, is, shown, saying, mass, when, christ, as, the, man, of, sorrows, appears, on, the, altar, the, subject, was, most, common, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, and, reflected, growing, emphasis, on, the, real, presence, and,

britain, appreciation, for, gregory, remained, strong, even, after, his, death, with, him, being, called, gregorius, noster, our, gregory, by, the, british, it, was, in, britain, at, a, monastery, in, whitby, that, the, first, full, length, life, of, gregory, was, written, c, 713, by, a, monk, or, possibly, a, nun, appreciation, of, gregory, in, rome, and, italy, itself, however, did, not, come, until, later, the, first, vita, of, gregory, written, in, italy, was, not, produced, until, johannes, hymonides, aka, john, the, deacon, in, the, 9th, century, the, namesake, church, of, san,
