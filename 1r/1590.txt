hipparchus, h, p, r, k, s, greek, h, pparkhos, c, 190, c, 120, bc, was, a, greek, astronomer, geographer, and, mathematician, he, is, considered, the, founder, of, trigonometry, but, is, most, famous, for, his, incidental, discovery, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, hipparchus, was, born, in, nicaea, bithynia, and, probably, died, on, the, island, of, rhodes, greece, he, is, known, to, have, been, a, working, astronomer, between, 162, and, 127, bc, hipparchus, is, considered, the, greatest, ancient, astronomical, observer, and, by, some, the, greatest, overall, astronomer, of, antiquity, he, was, the, first, whose, quantitative, and, accurate, models, for, the, motion, of, the, sun, and, moon, survive, for, this, he, certainly, made, use, of, the, observations, and, perhaps, the, mathematical, techniques, accumulated, over, centuries, by, the, babylonians, and, by, meton, of, athens, fifth, century, bc, timocharis, aristyllus, aristarchus, of, samos, and, eratosthenes, among, others, he, developed, trigonometry, and, constructed, trigonometric, tables, and, he, solved, several, problems, of, spherical, trigonometry, with, his, solar, and, lunar, theories, and, his, trigonometry, he, may, have, been, the, first, to, develop, a, reliable, method, to, predict, solar, eclipses, his, other, reputed, achievements, include, the, discovery, and, measurement, of, earth, s, precession, the, compilation, of, the, first, known, comprehensive, star, catalog, from, the, western, world, and, possibly, the, invention, of, the, astrolabe, as, well, as, of, the, armillary, sphere, that, he, may, have, used, in, creating, the, star, catalogue, hipparchus, is, sometimes, called, the, father, of, astronomy, a, title, conferred, on, him, by, jean, baptiste, joseph, delambre, in, 1817, hipparchus, was, born, in, nicaea, greek, in, bithynia, the, exact, dates, of, his, life, are, not, known, but, ptolemy, attributes, astronomical, observations, to, him, in, the, period, from, 147, to, 127, bc, and, some, of, these, are, stated, as, made, in, rhodes, earlier, observations, since, 162, bc, might, also, have, been, made, by, him, his, birth, date, c, 190, bc, was, calculated, by, delambre, based, on, clues, in, his, work, hipparchus, must, have, lived, some, time, after, 127, bc, because, he, analyzed, and, published, his, observations, from, that, year, hipparchus, obtained, information, from, alexandria, as, well, as, babylon, but, it, is, not, known, when, or, if, he, visited, these, places, he, is, believed, to, have, died, on, the, island, of, rhodes, where, he, seems, to, have, spent, most, of, his, later, life, in, the, second, and, third, centuries, coins, were, made, in, his, honour, in, bithynia, that, bear, his, name, and, show, him, with, a, globe, relatively, little, of, hipparchus, s, direct, work, survives, into, modern, times, although, he, wrote, at, least, fourteen, books, only, his, commentary, on, the, popular, astronomical, poem, by, aratus, was, preserved, by, later, copyists, most, of, what, is, known, about, hipparchus, comes, from, strabo, s, geography, and, pliny, s, natural, history, in, the, first, century, ptolemy, s, second, century, almagest, and, additional, references, to, him, in, the, fourth, century, by, pappus, and, theon, of, alexandria, in, their, commentaries, on, the, almagest, hipparchus, s, only, preserved, work, is, commentary, on, the, phaenomena, of, eudoxus, and, aratus, greek, this, is, a, highly, critical, commentary, in, the, form, of, two, books, on, a, popular, poem, by, aratus, based, on, the, work, by, eudoxus, hipparchus, also, made, a, list, of, his, major, works, that, apparently, mentioned, about, fourteen, books, but, which, is, only, known, from, references, by, later, authors, his, famous, star, catalog, was, incorporated, into, the, one, by, ptolemy, and, may, be, almost, perfectly, reconstructed, by, subtraction, of, two, and, two, thirds, degrees, from, the, longitudes, of, ptolemy, s, stars, the, first, trigonometric, table, was, apparently, compiled, by, hipparchus, who, is, consequently, now, known, as, the, father, of, trigonometry, earlier, greek, astronomers, and, mathematicians, were, influenced, by, babylonian, astronomy, to, some, extent, for, instance, the, period, relations, of, the, metonic, cycle, and, saros, cycle, may, have, come, from, babylonian, sources, see, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, hipparchus, seems, to, have, been, the, first, to, exploit, babylonian, astronomical, knowledge, and, techniques, systematically, eudoxus, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, timocharis, and, aristillus, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, already, divided, the, ecliptic, in, 360, parts, our, degrees, greek, moira, of, 60, arcminutes, and, hipparchus, continued, this, tradition, it, was, only, in, hipparchus, s, time, 2nd, century, bc, when, this, division, was, introduced, probably, by, hipparchus, s, contemporary, hypsikles, for, all, circles, in, mathematics, eratosthenes, 3rd, century, bc, in, contrast, used, a, simpler, sexagesimal, system, dividing, a, circle, into, 60, parts, hipparchus, also, adopted, the, babylonian, astronomical, cubit, unit, akkadian, ammatu, greek, p, chys, that, was, equivalent, to, 2, or, 2, 5, large, cubit, hipparchus, probably, compiled, a, list, of, babylonian, astronomical, observations, gerald, j, toomer, a, historian, of, astronomy, has, suggested, that, ptolemy, s, knowledge, of, eclipse, records, and, other, babylonian, observations, in, the, almagest, came, from, a, list, made, by, hipparchus, hipparchus, s, use, of, babylonian, sources, has, always, been, known, in, a, general, way, because, of, ptolemy, s, statements, but, the, only, text, by, hipparchus, that, survives, does, not, provide, sufficient, information, to, decide, whether, hipparchus, s, knowledge, such, as, his, usage, of, the, units, cubit, and, finger, degrees, and, minutes, or, the, concept, of, hour, stars, was, based, on, babylonian, practice, however, franz, xaver, kugler, demonstrated, that, the, synodic, and, anomalistic, periods, that, ptolemy, attributes, to, hipparchus, had, already, been, used, in, babylonian, ephemerides, specifically, the, collection, of, texts, nowadays, called, system, b, sometimes, attributed, to, kidinnu, hipparchus, s, long, draconitic, lunar, period, 5, 458, months, 5, 923, lunar, nodal, periods, also, appears, a, few, times, in, babylonian, records, but, the, only, such, tablet, explicitly, dated, is, post, hipparchus, so, the, direction, of, transmission, is, not, settled, by, the, tablets, hipparchus, was, recognized, as, the, first, mathematician, known, to, have, possessed, a, trigonometric, table, which, he, needed, when, computing, the, eccentricity, of, the, orbits, of, the, moon, and, sun, he, tabulated, values, for, the, chord, function, which, for, a, central, angle, in, a, circle, gives, the, length, of, the, straight, line, segment, between, the, points, where, the, angle, intersects, the, circle, he, may, have, computed, this, for, a, circle, with, a, circumference, of, 21, 600, units, and, a, radius, rounded, of, 3, 438, units, this, circle, has, a, unit, length, for, each, arcminute, along, its, perimeter, this, was, proven, by, toomer, but, he, later, cast, doubt, upon, his, earlier, affirmation, other, authors, have, argued, that, a, circle, of, radius, 3, 600, units, may, instead, have, been, used, by, hipparchus, he, tabulated, the, chords, for, angles, with, increments, of, 7, 5, in, modern, terms, the, chord, subtended, by, a, central, angle, in, a, circle, of, given, radius, r, equals, r, times, twice, the, sine, of, half, of, the, angle, i, e, the, now, lost, work, in, which, hipparchus, is, said, to, have, developed, his, chord, table, is, called, t, n, en, kukl, i, euthei, n, of, lines, inside, a, circle, in, theon, of, alexandria, s, fourth, century, commentary, on, section, i, 10, of, the, almagest, some, claim, the, table, of, hipparchus, may, have, survived, in, astronomical, treatises, in, india, such, as, the, surya, siddhanta, trigonometry, was, a, significant, innovation, because, it, allowed, greek, astronomers, to, solve, any, triangle, and, made, it, possible, to, make, quantitative, astronomical, models, and, predictions, using, their, preferred, geometric, techniques, hipparchus, must, have, used, a, better, approximation, for, than, the, one, given, by, archimedes, of, between, 3, 10, 71, 3, 1408, and, 3, 1, 7, 3, 1429, perhaps, he, had, the, approximation, later, used, by, ptolemy, sexagesimal, 3, 08, 30, 3, 1417, almagest, vi, 7, hipparchus, could, have, constructed, his, chord, table, using, the, pythagorean, theorem, and, a, theorem, known, to, archimedes, he, also, might, have, used, the, relationship, between, sides, and, diagonals, of, a, cyclic, quadrilateral, today, called, ptolemy, s, theorem, because, its, earliest, extant, source, is, a, proof, in, the, almagest, i, 10, the, stereographic, projection, was, ambiguously, attributed, to, hipparchus, by, synesius, c, 400, ad, and, on, that, basis, hipparchus, is, often, credited, with, inventing, it, or, at, least, knowing, of, it, however, some, scholars, believe, this, conclusion, to, be, unjustified, by, available, evidence, the, oldest, extant, description, of, the, stereographic, projection, is, found, in, ptolemy, s, planisphere, 2nd, century, ad, besides, geometry, hipparchus, also, used, arithmetic, techniques, developed, by, the, chaldeans, he, was, one, of, the, first, greek, mathematicians, to, do, this, and, in, this, way, expanded, the, techniques, available, to, astronomers, and, geographers, there, are, several, indications, that, hipparchus, knew, spherical, trigonometry, but, the, first, surviving, text, discussing, it, is, by, menelaus, of, alexandria, in, the, first, century, who, now, on, that, basis, commonly, is, credited, with, its, discovery, previous, to, the, finding, of, the, proofs, of, menelaus, a, century, ago, ptolemy, was, credited, with, the, invention, of, spherical, trigonometry, ptolemy, later, used, spherical, trigonometry, to, compute, things, such, as, the, rising, and, setting, points, of, the, ecliptic, or, to, take, account, of, the, lunar, parallax, if, he, did, not, use, spherical, trigonometry, hipparchus, may, have, used, a, globe, for, these, tasks, reading, values, off, coordinate, grids, drawn, on, it, or, he, may, have, made, approximations, from, planar, geometry, or, perhaps, used, arithmetical, approximations, developed, by, the, chaldeans, hipparchus, also, studied, the, motion, of, the, moon, and, confirmed, the, accurate, values, for, two, periods, of, its, motion, that, chaldean, astronomers, are, widely, presumed, to, have, possessed, before, him, the, traditional, value, from, babylonian, system, b, for, the, mean, synodic, month, is, 29, days, 31, 50, 8, 20, sexagesimal, 29, 5305941, days, expressed, as, 29, days, 12, hours, 793, 1080, hours, this, value, has, been, used, later, in, the, hebrew, calendar, the, chaldeans, also, knew, that, 251, synodic, months, 269, anomalistic, months, hipparchus, used, the, multiple, of, this, period, by, a, factor, of, 17, because, that, interval, is, also, an, eclipse, period, and, is, also, close, to, an, integer, number, of, years, 4, 267, moons, 4, 573, anomalistic, periods, 4, 630, 53, nodal, periods, 4, 611, 98, lunar, orbits, 344, 996, years, 344, 982, solar, orbits, 126, 007, 003, days, 126, 351, 985, rotations, what, was, so, exceptional, and, useful, about, the, cycle, was, that, all, 345, year, interval, eclipse, pairs, occur, slightly, more, than, 126, 007, days, apart, within, a, tight, range, of, only, approximately, 1, 2, hour, guaranteeing, after, division, by, 4, 267, an, estimate, of, the, synodic, month, correct, to, one, part, in, order, of, magnitude, 10, million, hipparchus, could, confirm, his, computations, by, comparing, eclipses, from, his, own, time, presumably, 27, january, 141, bc, and, 26, november, 139, bc, according, to, toomer, with, eclipses, from, babylonian, records, 345, years, earlier, almagest, iv, 2, later, al, biruni, qanun, vii, 2, ii, and, copernicus, de, revolutionibus, iv, 4, noted, that, the, period, of, 4, 267, moons, is, approximately, five, minutes, longer, than, the, value, for, the, eclipse, period, that, ptolemy, attributes, to, hipparchus, however, the, timing, methods, of, the, babylonians, had, an, error, of, no, fewer, than, eight, minutes, modern, scholars, agree, that, hipparchus, rounded, the, eclipse, period, to, the, nearest, hour, and, used, it, to, confirm, the, validity, of, the, traditional, values, rather, than, to, try, to, derive, an, improved, value, from, his, own, observations, from, modern, ephemerides, and, taking, account, of, the, change, in, the, length, of, the, day, see, t, we, estimate, that, the, error, in, the, assumed, length, of, the, synodic, month, was, less, than, 0, 2, second, in, the, fourth, century, bc, and, less, than, 0, 1, second, in, hipparchus, s, time, it, had, been, known, for, a, long, time, that, the, motion, of, the, moon, is, not, uniform, its, speed, varies, this, is, called, its, anomaly, and, it, repeats, with, its, own, period, the, anomalistic, month, the, chaldeans, took, account, of, this, arithmetically, and, used, a, table, giving, the, daily, motion, of, the, moon, according, to, the, date, within, a, long, period, however, the, greeks, preferred, to, think, in, geometrical, models, of, the, sky, at, the, end, of, the, third, century, bc, apollonius, of, perga, had, proposed, two, models, for, lunar, and, planetary, motion, apollonius, demonstrated, that, these, two, models, were, in, fact, mathematically, equivalent, however, all, this, was, theory, and, had, not, been, put, to, practice, hipparchus, is, the, first, astronomer, known, to, attempt, to, determine, the, relative, proportions, and, actual, sizes, of, these, orbits, hipparchus, devised, a, geometrical, method, to, find, the, parameters, from, three, positions, of, the, moon, at, particular, phases, of, its, anomaly, in, fact, he, did, this, separately, for, the, eccentric, and, the, epicycle, model, ptolemy, describes, the, details, in, the, almagest, iv, 11, hipparchus, used, two, sets, of, three, lunar, eclipse, observations, that, he, carefully, selected, to, satisfy, the, requirements, the, eccentric, model, he, fitted, to, these, eclipses, from, his, babylonian, eclipse, list, 22, 23, december, 383, bc, 18, 19, june, 382, bc, and, 12, 13, december, 382, bc, the, epicycle, model, he, fitted, to, lunar, eclipse, observations, made, in, alexandria, at, 22, september, 201, bc, 19, march, 200, bc, and, 11, september, 200, bc, these, figures, are, due, to, the, cumbersome, unit, he, used, in, his, chord, table, and, may, partly, be, due, to, some, sloppy, rounding, and, calculation, errors, by, hipparchus, for, which, ptolemy, criticised, him, while, also, making, rounding, errors, a, simpler, alternate, reconstruction, agrees, with, all, four, numbers, hipparchus, found, inconsistent, results, he, later, used, the, ratio, of, the, epicycle, model, 3122, 1, 2, 247, 1, 2, which, is, too, small, 60, 4, 45, sexagesimal, ptolemy, established, a, ratio, of, 60, 5, 1, 4, the, maximum, angular, deviation, producible, by, this, geometry, is, the, arcsin, of, 5, 1, 4, divided, by, 60, or, approximately, 5, 1, a, figure, that, is, sometimes, therefore, quoted, as, the, equivalent, of, the, moon, s, equation, of, the, center, in, the, hipparchan, model, before, hipparchus, meton, euctemon, and, their, pupils, at, athens, had, made, a, solstice, observation, i, e, timed, the, moment, of, the, summer, solstice, on, 27, june, 432, bc, proleptic, julian, calendar, aristarchus, of, samos, is, said, to, have, done, so, in, 280, bc, and, hipparchus, also, had, an, observation, by, archimedes, he, observed, the, summer, solstices, in, 146, and, 135, bc, both, accurately, to, a, few, hours, but, observations, of, the, moment, of, equinox, were, simpler, and, he, made, twenty, during, his, lifetime, ptolemy, gives, an, extensive, discussion, of, hipparchus, s, work, on, the, length, of, the, year, in, the, almagest, iii, 1, and, quotes, many, observations, that, hipparchus, made, or, used, spanning, 162, 128, bc, including, an, equinox, timing, by, hipparchus, at, 24, march, 146, bc, at, dawn, that, differs, by, 5, hours, from, the, observation, made, on, alexandria, s, large, public, equatorial, ring, that, same, day, at, 1, hour, before, noon, ptolemy, claims, his, solar, observations, were, on, a, transit, instrument, set, in, the, meridian, at, the, end, of, his, career, hipparchus, wrote, a, book, entitled, peri, eniaus, ou, meg, thous, on, the, length, of, the, year, regarding, his, results, the, established, value, for, the, tropical, year, introduced, by, callippus, in, or, before, 330, bc, was, 365, 1, 4, days, speculating, a, babylonian, origin, for, the, callippic, year, is, difficult, to, defend, since, babylon, did, not, observe, solstices, thus, the, only, extant, system, b, year, length, was, based, on, greek, solstices, see, below, hipparchus, s, equinox, observations, gave, varying, results, but, he, points, out, quoted, in, almagest, iii, 1, h195, that, the, observation, errors, by, him, and, his, predecessors, may, have, been, as, large, as, 1, 4, day, he, used, old, solstice, observations, and, determined, a, difference, of, approximately, one, day, in, approximately, 300, years, so, he, set, the, length, of, the, tropical, year, to, 365, 1, 4, 1, 300, days, 365, 24666, days, 365, days, 5, hours, 55, min, which, differs, from, the, modern, estimate, of, the, value, including, earth, spin, acceleration, in, his, time, of, approximately, 365, 2425, days, an, error, of, approximately, 6, min, per, year, an, hour, per, decade, and, ten, hours, per, century, between, the, solstice, observation, of, meton, and, his, own, there, were, 297, years, spanning, 108, 478, days, this, implies, a, tropical, year, of, 365, 24579, days, 365, days, 14, 44, 51, sexagesimal, 365, days, 14, 60, 44, 60, 2, 51, 60, 3, a, year, length, found, on, one, of, the, few, babylonian, clay, tablets, which, explicitly, specifies, the, system, b, month, whether, babylonians, knew, of, hipparchus, s, work, or, the, other, way, around, is, debatable, hipparchus, also, gave, the, value, for, the, sidereal, year, to, be, 365, 1, 4, 1, 144, days, 365, 25694, days, 365, days, 6, hours, 10, min, another, value, for, the, sidereal, year, that, is, attributed, to, hipparchus, by, the, physician, galen, in, the, second, century, ad, is, 365, 1, 4, 1, 288, days, 365, 25347, days, 365, days, 6, hours, 5, min, but, this, may, be, a, corruption, of, another, value, attributed, to, a, babylonian, source, 365, 1, 4, 1, 144, days, 365, 25694, days, 365, days, 6, hours, 10, min, it, is, not, clear, whether, hipparchus, got, the, value, from, babylonian, astronomers, or, calculated, by, himself, before, hipparchus, astronomers, knew, that, the, lengths, of, the, seasons, are, not, equal, hipparchus, made, observations, of, equinox, and, solstice, and, according, to, ptolemy, almagest, iii, 4, determined, that, spring, from, spring, equinox, to, summer, solstice, lasted, 94, 1, 2, days, and, summer, from, summer, solstice, to, autumn, equinox, 92, 1, 2, days, this, is, inconsistent, with, a, premise, of, the, sun, moving, around, the, earth, in, a, circle, at, uniform, speed, hipparchus, s, solution, was, to, place, the, earth, not, at, the, center, of, the, sun, s, motion, but, at, some, distance, from, the, center, this, model, described, the, apparent, motion, of, the, sun, fairly, well, it, is, known, today, that, the, planets, including, the, earth, move, in, approximate, ellipses, around, the, sun, but, this, was, not, discovered, until, johannes, kepler, published, his, first, two, laws, of, planetary, motion, in, 1609, the, value, for, the, eccentricity, attributed, to, hipparchus, by, ptolemy, is, that, the, offset, is, 1, 24, of, the, radius, of, the, orbit, which, is, a, little, too, large, and, the, direction, of, the, apogee, would, be, at, longitude, 65, 5, from, the, vernal, equinox, hipparchus, may, also, have, used, other, sets, of, observations, which, would, lead, to, different, values, one, of, his, two, eclipse, trios, solar, longitudes, are, consistent, with, his, having, initially, adopted, inaccurate, lengths, for, spring, and, summer, of, 95, 3, 4, and, 91, 1, 4, days, his, other, triplet, of, solar, positions, is, consistent, with, 94, 1, 4, and, 92, 1, 2, days, an, improvement, on, the, results, 94, 1, 2, and, 92, 1, 2, days, attributed, to, hipparchus, by, ptolemy, ptolemy, made, no, change, three, centuries, later, and, expressed, lengths, for, the, autumn, and, winter, seasons, which, were, already, implicit, as, shown, e, g, by, a, aaboe, hipparchus, also, undertook, to, find, the, distances, and, sizes, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, in, the, now, lost, work, on, sizes, and, distances, greek, peri, megethon, kai, apostematon, his, work, is, mentioned, in, ptolemy, s, almagest, v, 11, and, in, a, commentary, thereon, by, pappus, theon, of, smyrna, 2nd, century, also, mentions, the, work, under, the, title, on, sizes, and, distances, of, the, sun, and, moon, hipparchus, measured, the, apparent, diameters, of, the, sun, and, moon, with, his, diopter, like, others, before, and, after, him, he, found, that, the, moon, s, size, varies, as, it, moves, on, its, eccentric, orbit, but, he, found, no, perceptible, variation, in, the, apparent, diameter, of, the, sun, he, found, that, at, the, mean, distance, of, the, moon, the, sun, and, moon, had, the, same, apparent, diameter, at, that, distance, the, moon, s, diameter, fits, 650, times, into, the, circle, i, e, the, mean, apparent, diameters, are, 360, 650, 0, 33, 14, like, others, before, and, after, him, he, also, noticed, that, the, moon, has, a, noticeable, parallax, i, e, that, it, appears, displaced, from, its, calculated, position, compared, to, the, sun, or, stars, and, the, difference, is, greater, when, closer, to, the, horizon, he, knew, that, this, is, because, in, the, then, current, models, the, moon, circles, the, center, of, the, earth, but, the, observer, is, at, the, surface, the, moon, earth, and, observer, form, a, triangle, with, a, sharp, angle, that, changes, all, the, time, from, the, size, of, this, parallax, the, distance, of, the, moon, as, measured, in, earth, radii, can, be, determined, for, the, sun, however, there, was, no, observable, parallax, we, now, know, that, it, is, about, 8, 8, several, times, smaller, than, the, resolution, of, the, unaided, eye, in, the, first, book, hipparchus, assumes, that, the, parallax, of, the, sun, is, 0, as, if, it, is, at, infinite, distance, he, then, analyzed, a, solar, eclipse, which, toomer, presumes, to, be, the, eclipse, of, 14, march, 190, bc, it, was, total, in, the, region, of, the, hellespont, and, in, his, birthplace, nicaea, at, the, time, toomer, proposes, the, romans, were, preparing, for, war, with, antiochus, iii, in, the, area, and, the, eclipse, is, mentioned, by, livy, in, his, ab, urbe, condita, libri, viii, 2, it, was, also, observed, in, alexandria, where, the, sun, was, reported, to, be, obscured, 4, 5ths, by, the, moon, alexandria, and, nicaea, are, on, the, same, meridian, alexandria, is, at, about, 31, north, and, the, region, of, the, hellespont, about, 40, north, it, has, been, contended, that, authors, like, strabo, and, ptolemy, had, fairly, decent, values, for, these, geographical, positions, so, hipparchus, must, have, known, them, too, however, strabo, s, hipparchus, dependent, latitudes, for, this, region, are, at, least, 1, too, high, and, ptolemy, appears, to, copy, them, placing, byzantium, 2, high, in, latitude, hipparchus, could, draw, a, triangle, formed, by, the, two, places, and, the, moon, and, from, simple, geometry, was, able, to, establish, a, distance, of, the, moon, expressed, in, earth, radii, because, the, eclipse, occurred, in, the, morning, the, moon, was, not, in, the, meridian, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, as, a, consequence, the, distance, found, by, hipparchus, was, a, lower, limit, in, any, case, according, to, pappus, hipparchus, found, that, the, least, distance, is, 71, from, this, eclipse, and, the, greatest, 83, earth, radii, in, the, second, book, hipparchus, starts, from, the, opposite, extreme, assumption, he, assigns, a, minimum, distance, to, the, sun, of, 490, earth, radii, this, would, correspond, to, a, parallax, of, 7, which, is, apparently, the, greatest, parallax, that, hipparchus, thought, would, not, be, noticed, for, comparison, the, typical, resolution, of, the, human, eye, is, about, 2, tycho, brahe, made, naked, eye, observation, with, an, accuracy, down, to, 1, in, this, case, the, shadow, of, the, earth, is, a, cone, rather, than, a, cylinder, as, under, the, first, assumption, hipparchus, observed, at, lunar, eclipses, that, at, the, mean, distance, of, the, moon, the, diameter, of, the, shadow, cone, is, 2, 1, 2, lunar, diameters, that, apparent, diameter, is, as, he, had, observed, 360, 650, degrees, with, these, values, and, simple, geometry, hipparchus, could, determine, the, mean, distance, because, it, was, computed, for, a, minimum, distance, of, the, sun, it, is, the, maximum, mean, distance, possible, for, the, moon, with, his, value, for, the, eccentricity, of, the, orbit, he, could, compute, the, least, and, greatest, distances, of, the, moon, too, according, to, pappus, he, found, a, least, distance, of, 62, a, mean, of, 67, 1, 3, and, consequently, a, greatest, distance, of, 72, 2, 3, earth, radii, with, this, method, as, the, parallax, of, the, sun, decreases, i, e, its, distance, increases, the, minimum, limit, for, the, mean, distance, is, 59, earth, radii, exactly, the, mean, distance, that, ptolemy, later, derived, hipparchus, thus, had, the, problematic, result, that, his, minimum, distance, from, book, 1, was, greater, than, his, maximum, mean, distance, from, book, 2, he, was, intellectually, honest, about, this, discrepancy, and, probably, realized, that, especially, the, first, method, is, very, sensitive, to, the, accuracy, of, the, observations, and, parameters, in, fact, modern, calculations, show, that, the, size, of, the, 189, bc, solar, eclipse, at, alexandria, must, have, been, closer, to, 9, 10, ths, and, not, the, reported, 4, 5, ths, a, fraction, more, closely, matched, by, the, degree, of, totality, at, alexandria, of, eclipses, occurring, in, 310, and, 129, bc, which, were, also, nearly, total, in, the, hellespont, and, are, thought, by, many, to, be, more, likely, possibilities, for, the, eclipse, hipparchus, used, for, his, computations, ptolemy, later, measured, the, lunar, parallax, directly, almagest, v, 13, and, used, the, second, method, of, hipparchus, with, lunar, eclipses, to, compute, the, distance, of, the, sun, almagest, v, 15, he, criticizes, hipparchus, for, making, contradictory, assumptions, and, obtaining, conflicting, results, almagest, v, 11, but, apparently, he, failed, to, understand, hipparchus, s, strategy, to, establish, limits, consistent, with, the, observations, rather, than, a, single, value, for, the, distance, his, results, were, the, best, so, far, the, actual, mean, distance, of, the, moon, is, 60, 3, earth, radii, within, his, limits, from, hipparchus, s, second, book, theon, of, smyrna, wrote, that, according, to, hipparchus, the, sun, is, 1, 880, times, the, size, of, the, earth, and, the, earth, twenty, seven, times, the, size, of, the, moon, apparently, this, refers, to, volumes, not, diameters, from, the, geometry, of, book, 2, it, follows, that, the, sun, is, at, 2, 550, earth, radii, and, the, mean, distance, of, the, moon, is, 60, 1, 2, radii, similarly, cleomedes, quotes, hipparchus, for, the, sizes, of, the, sun, and, earth, as, 1050, 1, this, leads, to, a, mean, lunar, distance, of, 61, radii, apparently, hipparchus, later, refined, his, computations, and, derived, accurate, single, values, that, he, could, use, for, predictions, of, solar, eclipses, see, toomer, 1974, for, a, more, detailed, discussion, pliny, naturalis, historia, ii, x, tells, us, that, hipparchus, demonstrated, that, lunar, eclipses, can, occur, five, months, apart, and, solar, eclipses, seven, months, instead, of, the, usual, six, months, and, the, sun, can, be, hidden, twice, in, thirty, days, but, as, seen, by, different, nations, ptolemy, discussed, this, a, century, later, at, length, in, almagest, vi, 6, the, geometry, and, the, limits, of, the, positions, of, sun, and, moon, when, a, solar, or, lunar, eclipse, is, possible, are, explained, in, almagest, vi, 5, hipparchus, apparently, made, similar, calculations, the, result, that, two, solar, eclipses, can, occur, one, month, apart, is, important, because, this, can, not, be, based, on, observations, one, is, visible, on, the, northern, and, the, other, on, the, southern, hemisphere, as, pliny, indicates, and, the, latter, was, inaccessible, to, the, greek, prediction, of, a, solar, eclipse, i, e, exactly, when, and, where, it, will, be, visible, requires, a, solid, lunar, theory, and, proper, treatment, of, the, lunar, parallax, hipparchus, must, have, been, the, first, to, be, able, to, do, this, a, rigorous, treatment, requires, spherical, trigonometry, thus, those, who, remain, certain, that, hipparchus, lacked, it, must, speculate, that, he, may, have, made, do, with, planar, approximations, he, may, have, discussed, these, things, in, per, t, s, kat, pl, tos, m, nia, as, t, s, sel, n, s, kin, se, s, on, the, monthly, motion, of, the, moon, in, latitude, a, work, mentioned, in, the, suda, pliny, also, remarks, that, he, also, discovered, for, what, exact, reason, although, the, shadow, causing, the, eclipse, must, from, sunrise, onward, be, below, the, earth, it, happened, once, in, the, past, that, the, moon, was, eclipsed, in, the, west, while, both, luminaries, were, visible, above, the, earth, translation, h, rackham, 1938, loeb, classical, library, 330, p, 207, toomer, argued, that, this, must, refer, to, the, large, total, lunar, eclipse, of, 26, november, 139, bc, when, over, a, clean, sea, horizon, as, seen, from, rhodes, the, moon, was, eclipsed, in, the, northwest, just, after, the, sun, rose, in, the, southeast, this, would, be, the, second, eclipse, of, the, 345, year, interval, that, hipparchus, used, to, verify, the, traditional, babylonian, periods, this, puts, a, late, date, to, the, development, of, hipparchus, s, lunar, theory, we, do, not, know, what, exact, reason, hipparchus, found, for, seeing, the, moon, eclipsed, while, apparently, it, was, not, in, exact, opposition, to, the, sun, parallax, lowers, the, altitude, of, the, luminaries, refraction, raises, them, and, from, a, high, point, of, view, the, horizon, is, lowered, hipparchus, and, his, predecessors, used, various, instruments, for, astronomical, calculations, and, observations, such, as, the, gnomon, the, astrolabe, and, the, armillary, sphere, hipparchus, is, credited, with, the, invention, or, improvement, of, several, astronomical, instruments, which, were, used, for, a, long, time, for, naked, eye, observations, according, to, synesius, of, ptolemais, 4th, century, he, made, the, first, astrolabion, this, may, have, been, an, armillary, sphere, which, ptolemy, however, says, he, constructed, in, almagest, v, 1, or, the, predecessor, of, the, planar, instrument, called, astrolabe, also, mentioned, by, theon, of, alexandria, with, an, astrolabe, hipparchus, was, the, first, to, be, able, to, measure, the, geographical, latitude, and, time, by, observing, fixed, stars, previously, this, was, done, at, daytime, by, measuring, the, shadow, cast, by, a, gnomon, by, recording, the, length, of, the, longest, day, of, the, year, or, with, the, portable, instrument, known, as, a, scaphe, ptolemy, mentions, almagest, v, 14, that, he, used, a, similar, instrument, as, hipparchus, called, dioptra, to, measure, the, apparent, diameter, of, the, sun, and, moon, pappus, of, alexandria, described, it, in, his, commentary, on, the, almagest, of, that, chapter, as, did, proclus, hypotyposis, iv, it, was, a, four, foot, rod, with, a, scale, a, sighting, hole, at, one, end, and, a, wedge, that, could, be, moved, along, the, rod, to, exactly, obscure, the, disk, of, sun, or, moon, hipparchus, also, observed, solar, equinoxes, which, may, be, done, with, an, equatorial, ring, its, shadow, falls, on, itself, when, the, sun, is, on, the, equator, i, e, in, one, of, the, equinoctial, points, on, the, ecliptic, but, the, shadow, falls, above, or, below, the, opposite, side, of, the, ring, when, the, sun, is, south, or, north, of, the, equator, ptolemy, quotes, in, almagest, iii, 1, h195, a, description, by, hipparchus, of, an, equatorial, ring, in, alexandria, a, little, further, he, describes, two, such, instruments, present, in, alexandria, in, his, own, time, hipparchus, applied, his, knowledge, of, spherical, angles, to, the, problem, of, denoting, locations, on, the, earth, s, surface, before, him, a, grid, system, had, been, used, by, dicaearchus, of, messana, but, hipparchus, was, the, first, to, apply, mathematical, rigor, to, the, determination, of, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, places, on, the, earth, hipparchus, wrote, a, critique, in, three, books, on, the, work, of, the, geographer, eratosthenes, of, cyrene, 3rd, century, bc, called, pr, s, t, n, eratosth, nous, geograph, an, against, the, geography, of, eratosthenes, it, is, known, to, us, from, strabo, of, amaseia, who, in, his, turn, criticised, hipparchus, in, his, own, geographia, hipparchus, apparently, made, many, detailed, corrections, to, the, locations, and, distances, mentioned, by, eratosthenes, it, seems, he, did, not, introduce, many, improvements, in, methods, but, he, did, propose, a, means, to, determine, the, geographical, longitudes, of, different, cities, at, lunar, eclipses, strabo, geographia, 1, january, 2012, a, lunar, eclipse, is, visible, simultaneously, on, half, of, the, earth, and, the, difference, in, longitude, between, places, can, be, computed, from, the, difference, in, local, time, when, the, eclipse, is, observed, his, approach, would, give, accurate, results, if, it, were, correctly, carried, out, but, the, limitations, of, timekeeping, accuracy, in, his, era, made, this, method, impractical, late, in, his, career, possibly, about, 135, bc, hipparchus, compiled, his, star, catalog, scholars, have, been, searching, for, it, for, centuries, in, 2022, it, was, announced, that, a, part, of, it, was, discovered, in, a, medieval, parchment, manuscript, codex, climaci, rescriptus, from, saint, catherine, s, monastery, in, the, sinai, peninsula, egypt, as, hidden, text, palimpsest, hipparchus, also, constructed, a, celestial, globe, depicting, the, constellations, based, on, his, observations, his, interest, in, the, fixed, stars, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, observation, of, a, supernova, according, to, pliny, or, by, his, discovery, of, precession, according, to, ptolemy, who, says, that, hipparchus, could, not, reconcile, his, data, with, earlier, observations, made, by, timocharis, and, aristillus, for, more, information, see, discovery, of, precession, in, raphael, s, painting, the, school, of, athens, hipparchus, may, be, depicted, holding, his, celestial, globe, as, the, representative, figure, for, astronomy, it, is, not, certain, that, the, figure, is, meant, to, represent, him, previously, eudoxus, of, cnidus, in, the, fourth, century, bc, had, described, the, stars, and, constellations, in, two, books, called, phaenomena, and, entropon, aratus, wrote, a, poem, called, phaenomena, or, arateia, based, on, eudoxus, s, work, hipparchus, wrote, a, commentary, on, the, arateia, his, only, preserved, work, which, contains, many, stellar, positions, and, times, for, rising, culmination, and, setting, of, the, constellations, and, these, are, likely, to, have, been, based, on, his, own, measurements, according, to, roman, sources, hipparchus, made, his, measurements, with, a, scientific, instrument, and, he, obtained, the, positions, of, roughly, 850, stars, pliny, the, elder, writes, in, book, ii, 24, 26, of, his, natural, history, this, same, hipparchus, who, can, never, be, sufficiently, commended, discovered, a, new, star, that, was, produced, in, his, own, age, and, by, observing, its, motions, on, the, day, in, which, it, shone, he, was, led, to, doubt, whether, it, does, not, often, happen, that, those, stars, have, motion, which, we, suppose, to, be, fixed, and, the, same, individual, attempted, what, might, seem, presumptuous, even, in, a, deity, viz, to, number, the, stars, for, posterity, and, to, express, their, relations, by, appropriate, names, having, previously, devised, instruments, by, which, he, might, mark, the, places, and, the, magnitudes, of, each, individual, star, in, this, way, it, might, be, easily, discovered, not, only, whether, they, were, destroyed, or, produced, but, whether, they, changed, their, relative, positions, and, likewise, whether, they, were, increased, or, diminished, the, heavens, being, thus, left, as, an, inheritance, to, any, one, who, might, be, found, competent, to, complete, his, plan, this, passage, reports, that, it, is, unknown, what, instrument, he, used, the, armillary, sphere, was, probably, invented, only, later, maybe, by, ptolemy, 265, years, after, hipparchus, the, historian, of, science, s, hoffmann, found, clues, that, hipparchus, may, have, observed, the, longitudes, and, latitudes, in, different, coordinate, systems, and, thus, with, different, instrumentation, right, ascensions, for, instance, could, have, been, observed, with, a, clock, while, angular, separations, could, have, been, measured, with, another, device, hipparchus, is, conjectured, to, have, ranked, the, apparent, magnitudes, of, stars, on, a, numerical, scale, from, 1, the, brightest, to, 6, the, faintest, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, the, vague, statement, by, pliny, the, elder, but, cannot, be, proven, by, the, data, in, hipparchus, s, commentary, on, aratus, s, poem, in, this, only, work, by, his, hand, that, has, survived, until, today, he, does, not, use, the, magnitude, scale, but, estimates, brightnesses, unsystematically, however, this, does, not, prove, or, disprove, anything, because, the, commentary, might, be, an, early, work, while, the, magnitude, scale, could, have, been, introduced, later, nevertheless, this, system, certainly, precedes, ptolemy, who, used, it, extensively, about, ad, 150, this, system, was, made, more, precise, and, extended, by, n, r, pogson, in, 1856, who, placed, the, magnitudes, on, a, logarithmic, scale, making, magnitude, 1, stars, 100, times, brighter, than, magnitude, 6, stars, thus, each, magnitude, is, 5, 100, or, 2, 512, times, brighter, than, the, next, faintest, magnitude, it, is, disputed, which, coordinate, system, s, he, used, ptolemy, s, catalog, in, the, almagest, which, is, derived, from, hipparchus, s, catalog, is, given, in, ecliptic, coordinates, although, hipparchus, strictly, distinguishes, between, signs, 30, section, of, the, zodiac, and, constellations, in, the, zodiac, it, is, highly, questionable, whether, or, not, he, had, an, instrument, to, directly, observe, measure, units, on, the, ecliptic, he, probably, marked, them, as, a, unit, on, his, celestial, globe, but, the, instrumentation, for, his, observations, is, unknown, delambre, in, his, histoire, de, l, astronomie, ancienne, 1817, concluded, that, hipparchus, knew, and, used, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, a, conclusion, challenged, by, otto, neugebauer, in, his, history, of, ancient, mathematical, astronomy, 1975, hipparchus, seems, to, have, used, a, mix, of, ecliptic, coordinates, and, equatorial, coordinates, in, his, commentary, on, eudoxus, he, provides, stars, polar, distance, equivalent, to, the, declination, in, the, equatorial, system, right, ascension, equatorial, longitude, ecliptic, polar, longitude, hybrid, but, not, celestial, latitude, this, opinion, was, confirmed, by, the, careful, investigation, of, hoffmann, who, independently, studied, the, material, potential, sources, techniques, and, results, of, hipparchus, and, reconstructed, his, celestial, globe, and, its, making, as, with, most, of, his, work, hipparchus, s, star, catalog, was, adopted, and, perhaps, expanded, by, ptolemy, who, has, since, brahe, in, 1598, been, accused, by, some, of, fraud, for, stating, syntaxis, book, 7, chapter, 4, that, he, observed, all, 1025, stars, critics, claim, that, for, almost, every, star, he, used, hipparchus, s, data, and, precessed, it, to, his, own, epoch, 2, 2, 3, centuries, later, by, adding, 2, 40, to, the, longitude, using, an, erroneously, small, precession, constant, of, 1, per, century, this, claim, is, highly, exaggerated, because, it, applies, modern, standards, of, citation, to, an, ancient, author, true, is, only, that, the, ancient, star, catalogue, that, was, initiated, by, hipparchus, in, the, second, century, bc, was, reworked, and, improved, multiple, times, in, the, 265, years, to, the, almagest, which, is, good, scientific, practise, even, today, although, the, almagest, star, catalogue, is, based, upon, hipparchus, s, it, is, not, only, a, blind, copy, but, enriched, enhanced, and, thus, at, least, partially, re, observed, hipparchus, s, celestial, globe, was, an, instrument, similar, to, modern, electronic, computers, he, used, it, to, determine, risings, settings, and, culminations, cf, also, almagest, book, viii, chapter, 3, therefore, his, globe, was, mounted, in, a, horizontal, plane, and, had, a, meridian, ring, with, a, scale, in, combination, with, a, grid, that, divided, the, celestial, equator, into, 24, hour, lines, longitudes, equalling, our, right, ascension, hours, the, instrument, allowed, him, to, determine, the, hours, the, ecliptic, was, marked, and, divided, in, 12, sections, of, equal, length, the, signs, which, he, called, zodion, or, dodekatemoria, in, order, to, distinguish, them, from, constellations, astron, the, globe, was, virtually, reconstructed, by, a, historian, of, science, for, against, conclusion, hipparchus, s, star, catalogue, is, one, of, the, sources, of, the, almagest, star, catalogue, but, not, the, only, source, hipparchus, is, generally, recognized, as, discoverer, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, in, 127, bc, his, two, books, on, precession, on, the, displacement, of, the, solstitial, and, equinoctial, points, and, on, the, length, of, the, year, are, both, mentioned, in, the, almagest, of, claudius, ptolemy, according, to, ptolemy, hipparchus, measured, the, longitude, of, spica, and, regulus, and, other, bright, stars, comparing, his, measurements, with, data, from, his, predecessors, timocharis, and, aristillus, he, concluded, that, spica, had, moved, 2, relative, to, the, autumnal, equinox, he, also, compared, the, lengths, of, the, tropical, year, the, time, it, takes, the, sun, to, return, to, an, equinox, and, the, sidereal, year, the, time, it, takes, the, sun, to, return, to, a, fixed, star, and, found, a, slight, discrepancy, hipparchus, concluded, that, the, equinoxes, were, moving, precessing, through, the, zodiac, and, that, the, rate, of, precession, was, not, less, than, 1, in, a, century, hipparchus, s, treatise, against, the, geography, of, eratosthenes, in, three, books, is, not, preserved, most, of, our, knowledge, of, it, comes, from, strabo, according, to, whom, hipparchus, thoroughly, and, often, unfairly, criticized, eratosthenes, mainly, for, internal, contradictions, and, inaccuracy, in, determining, positions, of, geographical, localities, hipparchus, insists, that, a, geographic, map, must, be, based, only, on, astronomical, measurements, of, latitudes, and, longitudes, and, triangulation, for, finding, unknown, distances, in, geographic, theory, and, methods, hipparchus, introduced, three, main, innovations, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, grade, grid, to, determine, geographic, latitude, from, star, observations, and, not, only, from, the, sun, s, altitude, a, method, known, long, before, him, and, to, suggest, that, geographic, longitude, could, be, determined, by, means, of, simultaneous, observations, of, lunar, eclipses, in, distant, places, in, the, practical, part, of, his, work, the, so, called, table, of, climata, hipparchus, listed, latitudes, for, several, tens, of, localities, in, particular, he, improved, eratosthenes, values, for, the, latitudes, of, athens, sicily, and, southern, extremity, of, india, in, calculating, latitudes, of, climata, latitudes, correlated, with, the, length, of, the, longest, solstitial, day, hipparchus, used, an, unexpectedly, accurate, value, for, the, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, 23, 40, the, actual, value, in, the, second, half, of, the, second, century, bc, was, approximately, 23, 43, whereas, all, other, ancient, authors, knew, only, a, roughly, rounded, value, 24, and, even, ptolemy, used, a, less, accurate, value, 23, 51, hipparchus, opposed, the, view, generally, accepted, in, the, hellenistic, period, that, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, and, the, caspian, sea, are, parts, of, a, single, ocean, at, the, same, time, he, extends, the, limits, of, the, oikoumene, i, e, the, inhabited, part, of, the, land, up, to, the, equator, and, the, arctic, circle, hipparchus, s, ideas, found, their, reflection, in, the, geography, of, ptolemy, in, essence, ptolemy, s, work, is, an, extended, attempt, to, realize, hipparchus, s, vision, of, what, geography, ought, to, be, hipparchus, was, in, the, international, news, in, 2005, when, it, was, again, proposed, as, in, 1898, that, the, data, on, the, celestial, globe, of, hipparchus, or, in, his, star, catalog, may, have, been, preserved, in, the, only, surviving, large, ancient, celestial, globe, which, depicts, the, constellations, with, moderate, accuracy, the, globe, carried, by, the, farnese, atlas, evidence, suggests, that, the, farnese, globe, may, show, constellations, in, the, aratean, tradition, and, deviate, from, the, constellations, used, by, hipparchus, a, line, in, plutarch, s, table, talk, states, that,
