legends, about, mirabai, mention, her, fearless, disregard, for, social, and, family, conventions, her, devotion, to, krishna, her, treatment, of, krishna, as, her, husband, and, her, persecution, by, her, in, laws, for, her, religious, devotion, she, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, folk, tales, and, hagiographic, legends, which, are, inconsistent, or, widely, different, in, details, millions, of, devotional, hymns, in, passionate, praise, of, krishna, are, attributed, to, meerabai, in, the, indian, tradition, but, just, a, few, hundred, are, believed, to, be, authentic, by, scholars, and, the, earliest, written, records, suggest, that, except, for, two, hymns, most, were, first, written, down, in, the, 18th, century, many, poems, attributed, to, meera, were, likely, composed, later, by, others, who, admired, meera, these, hymns, are, a, type, of, bhajan, and, are, very, famous, across, india, some, hindu, temples, such, as, chittor, fort, are, dedicated, to, mirabai, s, memory, legends, about, mirabai, s, life, of, contested, authenticity, have, been, the, subject, of, movies, films, comic, strips, and, other, popular, literature, in, modern, times, primary, records, about, meera, are, not, available, and, scholars, have, attempted, to, establish, meera, s, biography, from, secondary, literature, that, mentions, her, mirabai, was, born, into, a, rathore, rajput, royal, family, in, kudki, modern, day, beawar, district, of, rajasthan, and, spent, her, childhood, in, merta, she, was, the, daughter, of, ratan, singh, and, grand, daughter, of, rao, dudaji, of, merta, meera, unwillingly, married, bhoj, raj, the, crown, prince, of, mewar, in, 1516, her, husband, was, wounded, in, one, of, the, ongoing, wars, with, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1518, and, he, died, from, battle, wounds, in, 1521, both, her, father, and, father, in, law, rana, sanga, died, a, few, days, after, their, defeat, in, the, battle, of, khanwa, against, babur, the, first, mughal, emperor, after, the, death, of, rana, sanga, vikram, singh, became, the, ruler, of, mewar, according, to, a, popular, legend, her, in, laws, tried, to, assassinate, her, multiple, times, these, attempts, included, sending, meera, a, glass, of, poison, and, telling, her, it, was, nectar, and, sending, her, a, basket, with, a, snake, instead, of, flowers, according, to, hagiographic, legends, she, was, not, harmed, in, either, case, with, the, snake, miraculously, becoming, depending, on, the, version, a, krishna, idol, or, a, garland, of, flowers, in, another, version, of, these, legends, she, is, asked, by, vikram, singh, to, drown, herself, when, she, attempts, to, do, so, she, merely, floats, on, the, water, yet, another, legend, states, that, the, third, mughal, emperor, akbar, came, with, tansen, to, visit, meera, and, presented, her, with, a, pearl, necklace, scholars, doubt, this, happened, as, tansen, joined, akbar, s, court, in, 1562, 15, years, after, meera, s, death, similarly, some, stories, state, that, ravidas, was, her, guru, teacher, but, there, is, no, corroborating, historical, evidence, for, this, as, of, 2014, the, three, oldest, records, that, mention, meera, are, all, from, the, 17th, century, and, written, within, 150, years, of, meera, s, death, neither, mentions, anything, about, her, childhood, the, circumstances, of, her, marriage, to, bhojraj, or, that, the, people, who, persecuted, her, were, her, in, laws, or, from, some, rajput, royal, family, nancy, martin, kershaw, states, that, to, the, extent, that, meera, was, challenged, and, persecuted, religious, or, social, conventions, were, unlikely, to, have, been, the, cause, rather, the, likely, cause, was, political, chaos, and, military, conflicts, between, the, rajput, kingdom, and, the, mughal, empire, other, stories, state, that, mira, bai, left, the, kingdom, of, mewar, and, went, on, pilgrimages, in, her, last, years, meera, lived, in, dwarka, or, vrindavan, where, legends, state, she, miraculously, disappeared, by, merging, into, an, idol, of, krishna, in, 1547, while, miracles, are, contested, by, scholars, for, the, lack, of, historical, evidence, it, is, widely, acknowledged, that, meera, dedicated, her, life, to, krishna, composing, songs, of, devotion, and, was, one, of, the, most, important, poet, saints, of, the, bhakti, movement, period, a, number, of, compositions, by, meera, bai, continue, to, be, sung, today, in, india, mostly, as, devotional, songs, bhajans, towards, krishna, though, nearly, all, of, them, have, a, philosophical, connotation, her, poems, describe, her, love, salutation, and, separation, from, krishna, and, her, dissatisfaction, with, the, world, one, of, her, most, popular, compositions, remains, payoji, maine, ram, ratan, dhan, payo, i, have, been, given, the, richness, of, god, s, name, blessing, meera, s, poems, are, lyrical, padas, metric, verses, in, the, rajasthani, language, several, meters, are, used, within, her, padas, but, the, most, common, meter, found, is, m, tric, syllabic, poetic, line, r, gas, or, melodies, are, attributed, to, these, padas, allowing, them, to, be, sung, while, thousands, of, verses, are, attributed, to, her, scholars, are, divided, as, to, how, many, of, them, were, actually, penned, by, meera, herself, there, are, no, surviving, manuscripts, of, her, poetry, from, her, time, and, the, earliest, records, with, two, poems, credited, to, her, are, from, the, early, 18th, century, more, than, 150, years, after, her, legendary, disappearance, in, 1547, the, most, extensive, collection, of, meera, s, poems, exists, in, manuscripts, from, the, 19th, century, to, establish, the, authenticity, of, the, poems, scholars, have, looked, at, various, factors, such, as, the, mention, of, meera, in, other, manuscripts, as, well, as, the, style, language, and, form, of, the, poems, john, stratton, hawley, cautions, when, one, speaks, of, the, poetry, of, mirabai, then, there, is, always, an, element, of, enigma, there, must, always, remain, a, question, about, whether, there, is, any, real, relation, between, the, poems, we, cite, and, a, historical, mira, in, her, poems, krishna, is, a, yogi, and, lover, and, she, herself, is, a, yogini, ready, to, take, her, place, by, his, side, in, a, spiritual, marital, bliss, meera, s, style, combines, impassioned, mood, defiance, longing, anticipation, joy, and, ecstasy, of, union, always, centered, on, krishna, my, dark, one, has, gone, to, an,

speaks, of, a, personal, relationship, with, krishna, as, her, lover, god, and, mountain, lifter, the, characteristic, of, her, poetry, is, complete, surrender, after, making, me, fall, for, you, so, hard, where, are, you, going, until, the, day, i, see, you, no, repose, my, life, like, a, fish, washed, on, shore, flails, in, agony, for, your, sake, i, ll, make, myself, a, yogini, i, ll, hurl,

bai, as, one, of, sixteen, historic, bhakti, saints, important, to, sikhism, scholars, acknowledge, that, meera, was, one, of, the, central, poet, saints, of, the, bhakti, movement, a, period, in, indian, history, rife, with, religious, conflicts, yet, they, simultaneously, question, the, extent, to, which, meera, was, a, canonical, projection, of, social, imagination, that, followed, where, she, became, a, symbol, of, people, s, suffering, and, a, desire, for, an, alternative, dirk, wiemann, quoting, parita, mukta, states, if, one, accepts, that, someone, very, akin, to, the, mira, legend, existed, as, an, actual, social, being, the, power, of, her, convictions, broke, the, brutal, feudal, relationships, that, existed, at, that, time, the, mira, bai, of, the, popular, imagination, then, is, an, intensely, anachronistic, figure, by, virtue, of, that, anticipatory, radical, democracy, which, propels, meera, out, of, the, historicity, that, remains, nonetheless, ascribed, to, her, she, goes, beyond, the, shadowy, realms, of, the, past, to, inhabit, the, very, core, of, a, future, which, is, embodied, within, the, suffering, of, a, people, who, seek, an, alternative, the, continued, influence, of, meera, in, part, has, been, her, message, of, freedom, her, resolve, and, right, to, pursue, her, devotion, to, krishna, and, her, spiritual, beliefs, as, she, felt, drawn, to, despite, her, persecution, her, appeal, and, influence, in, indian, culture, writes, edwin, bryant, is, from, her, emerging, through, her, legends, and, poems, as, a, person, who, stands, up, for, what, is, right, and, suffers, bitterly, for, holding, fast, to, her, convictions, as, other, men, and, women, have, yet, she, does, so, with, a, language, of, love, with, words,
