nominally, if, not, being, in, open, revolt, most, of, the, loyal, governors, of, the, cities, were, in, a, weak, position, such, as, the, governor, of, vora, who, could, not, prevent, an, attack, by, the, king, of, galicia, and, future, king, of, le, n, ordo, o, ii, who, captured, the, city, in, the, summer, of, 913, taking, back, a, sizable, booty, and, 4, 000, prisoners, and, massacring, many,

not, send, an, army, and, only, several, local, berber, jefes, offered, some, resistance, which, was, ineffective, we, are, the, most, worthy, to, fulfill, our, right, and, the, most, entitled, to, complete, our, good, fortune, and, to, put, on, the, clothing, granted, by, the, nobility, of, god, because, of, the, favour, which, he, has, shown, us, and, the, renown, which, he, has, given, us, and, the, power, to, which, he, has, raised, us, because, of, what, he, has, enabled, us, to, acquire, and, because, of, what, he, has, made, easy, for, us, and, for, our, state, to, achieve, he, has, made, our, name, and, the, greatness, of, our, power, celebrated, everywhere, and, he, has, made, the, hopes, of, the, worlds, depend, on, us, and, made, their, errings, turn, again, to, us, and, their, rejoicing, at, good, news, be, rejoicing, at, good, news, about, our, dynasty, and, praise, be, to, god, possessed, of, grace, and, kindness, for, the, grace, which, he, has, shown, most, worthy, of, superiority, for, the, superiority, which, he, has, granted, us, we, have, decided, that, the, da, wa, should, be, to, us, as, commander, of, the, faithful, and, that, letters, emanating, from, us, or, coming, to, us, should, be, in, the, same, manner, everyone, who, calls, himself, by, this, name, apart, from, ourselves, is, arrogating, it, to, himself, and, trespassing, upon, it, and, is, branded, with, something, to, which, he, has, no, right, we, know, that, if, we, were, to, continue, the, neglect, of, this, duty, which, is, owed, to, us, in, this, matter, then, we, should, be, forfeiting, our, right, and, neglecting, our, title, which, is, certain, so, order, the, kha, b, in, your, place, to, pronounce, using, and, address, your, communications, to, us, accordingly, if, god, will, written, on, thursday, 2, dh, al, ijja, 316, translated, by, david, wasserstein, despite, having, defeated, only, some, of, the, rebels, abd, al, rahman, iii, considered, himself, powerful, enough, to, declare, himself, caliph, of, c, rdoba, on, 16, january, 929, effectively, breaking, his, allegiance, to, and, ties, with, the, fatimid, and, abbasid, caliphs, the, caliphate, was, thought, only, to, belong, to, the, emperor, who, ruled, over, the, sacred, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, and, his, ancestors, had, until, then, been, content, with, the, title, of, emir, but, the, force, of, this, tradition, had, weakened, over, time, and, the, title, increased, abd, al, rahman, s, prestige, with, his, subjects, both, in, iberia, and, africa, he, based, his, claim, to, the, caliphate, on, his, umayyad, ancestors, who, had, held, undisputed, control, of, the, caliphate, until, they, were, overthrown, by, the, abbasids, abd, al, rahman, s, move, made, him, both, the, political, and, the, religious, leader, of, all, the, muslims, in, al, andalus, as, well, as, the, protector, of, his, christian, and, jewish, subjects, the, symbols, of, his, new, caliphal, power,

in, 951, he, signed, a, peace, with, the, new, king, of, le, n, ordo, o, iii, in, order, to, have, a, free, hand, against, the, fatimids, whose, ships, were, harassing, caliphal, shipping, in, the, mediterranean, and, had, even, launched, an, assault, against, almeria, abd, al, rahman, s, force, led, by, prime, minister, ahmad, ibn, said, besieged, the, fatimid, port, of, tunis, which, bought, its, safety, by, paying, a, huge, sum, in, the, end, he, was, able, to, create, a, protectorate, covering, the, northern, and, central, maghreb, supporting, the, idrisid, dynasty, the, caliphate, s, influence, in, the, area, disappeared, after, a, fatimid, offensive, in, 958, after, which, abd, al, rahman, kept, only, the, strongholds, of, ceuta, and, tangiers, even, before, al, andalus, was, firmly, under, his, rule, he, had, restarted, the, war, against, king, ordo, o, ii, of, le, n, who, had, taken, advantage, of, the, previous, troublesome, situation, to, capture, some, boundary, areas, and, menace, the, umayyad, territory, in, 917, the, then, emir, had, sent, a, large, army, under, his, general, ahmad, ibn, abi, abda, against, le, n, but, this, force, was, destroyed, at, the,
