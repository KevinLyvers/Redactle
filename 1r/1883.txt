championship, pop, warner, was, hesitant, to, allow, thorpe, his, best, track, and, field, athlete, to, compete, in, such, a, physical, game, as, football, thorpe, however, convinced, warner, to, let, him, try, some, rushing, plays, in, practice, against, the, school, team, s, defense, warner, assumed, he, would, be, tackled, easily, and, give, up, the, idea, thorpe, ran, around, past, and, through, them, not, once, but, twice, he, walked, over, to, warner, and, said, nobody, is, going, to, tackle, jim, while, flipping, him, the, ball, thorpe, first, gained, nationwide, notice, in, 1911, for, his, athletic, ability, as, a, running, back, defensive, back, placekicker, and, punter, thorpe, scored, all, of, his, team, s, four, field, goals, in, an, 18, 15, upset, of, harvard, a, top,

championship, largely, as, a, result, of, thorpe, s, efforts, he, scored, 25, touchdowns, and, 198, points, during, the, season, according, to, cnn, s, greg, botelho, steve, boda, a, researcher, for, the, ncaa, credits, thorpe, with, 27, touchdowns, and, 224, points, thorpe, rushed, 191, times, for, 1, 869, yards, according, to, boda, the, figures, do, not, include, statistics, from, two, of, carlisle, s, 14, games, in, 1912, because, full, records, are, not, available, carlisle, s, 1912, record, included, a, 27, 6, victory, over, the, west, point, army, team, in, that, game, thorpe, s,

him, in, that, game, recalled, of, thorpe, in, a, 1961, speech, here, and, there, there, are, some, people, who, are, supremely, endowed, my, memory, goes, back, to, jim, thorpe, he, never, practiced, in, his, life, and, he, could, do, anything, better, than, any, other, football, player, i, ever, saw, thorpe, was, a, third, team, all, american, in, 1908, and, a, first, team, all, american, in, 1911, and, 1912, football, was, and, remained, thorpe, s, favorite, sport, he, did, not, compete, in, track, and, field, in, 1910, or, 1911, although, this, turned, out, to, be, the, sport, in, which, he, gained, his, greatest, fame, in, the, spring, of, 1912, he, started, training, for, the, olympics, he, had, confined, his, efforts, to, jumps, hurdles, and, shot, puts, but, now, added, pole, vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer, and, 56, lb, weight, in, the, olympic, trials, held, at, celtic, park, in, new, york, his, all, round, ability, stood, out, in, all, these, events, and, so, he, earned, a, place, on, the, team, that, went, to, sweden, the, poet, marianne, moore, who, taught, thorpe, at, carlisle, recalled, he, had, a, kind, of, ease, in, his, gait, that, is, hard, to, describe, equilibrium, with, no, stricture, but, couched, in, the, lineup, of, football, he, was, the, epitome, of, concentration, wary, with, an, effect, of, plenty, in, reserve, for, the, 1912, summer, olympics, in, stockholm, sweden, two, new, multi, event, disciplines, were, included, the, pentathlon, and, the, decathlon, a, pentathlon, based, on, the, ancient, greek, event, had, been, introduced, at, the, 1906, intercalated, games, the, 1912, version, consisted, of, the, long, jump, javelin, throw, 200, meter, dash, discus, throw, and, 1500, meter, run, the, decathlon, was, a, relatively, new, event, in, modern, athletics, although, a, similar, competition, known, as, the, all, around, championship, had, been, part, of, american, track, meets, since, the, 1880s, a, men, s, version, had, been, featured, on, the, program, of, the, 1904, st, louis, olympics, the, events, of, the, new, decathlon, differed, slightly, from, the, american, version, thorpe, was, so, versatile, that, he, served, as, carlisle, s, one, man, team, in, several, track, meets, according, to, his, obituary, in, the, new, york, times, he, could, run, the, 100, yard, dash, in, 10, seconds, flat, the, 220, in, 21, 8, seconds, the, 440, in, 51, 8, seconds, the, 880, in, 1, 57, the, mile, in, 4, 35, the, 120, yard, high, hurdles, in, 15, seconds, and, the, 220, yard, low, hurdles, in, 24, seconds, he, could, long, jump, 23, ft, 6, in, and, high, jump, 6, ft, 5, in, he, could, pole, vault, 11, feet, put, the, shot, 47, ft, 9, in, throw, the, javelin, 163, feet, and, throw, the, discus, 136, feet, thorpe, entered, the, u, s, olympic, trials, for, both, the, pentathlon, and, the, decathlon, he, easily, earned, a, place, on, the, pentathlon, team, winning, three, events, the, decathlon, trial, was, subsequently, cancelled, and, thorpe, was, chosen, to, represent, the, u, s, in, the, event, the, pentathlon, and, decathlon, teams, also, included, avery, brundage, a, future, international, olympic, committee, president, thorpe, was, extremely, busy, in, the, olympics, along, with, the, decathlon, and, pentathlon, he, competed, in, the, long, jump, and, high, jump, the, first, competition, was, the, pentathlon, on, july, 7, he, won, four, of, the, five, events, and, placed, third, in, the, javelin, an, event, he, had, not, competed, in, before, 1912, although, the, pentathlon, was, primarily, decided, on, place, points, points, were, also, earned, for, the, marks, achieved, in, the, individual, events, thorpe, won, the, gold, medal, that, same, day, he, qualified, for, the, high, jump, final, in, which, he, finished, in, a, tie, for, fourth, on, july, 12, thorpe, placed, seventh, in, the, long, jump, thorpe, s, final, event, was, the, decathlon, his, first, and, as, it, turned, out, his, only, decathlon, strong, competition, from, local, favorite, hugo, wieslander, was, expected, thorpe, however, defeated, wieslander, by, 688, points, he, placed, in, the, top, four, in, all, ten, events, and, his, olympic, record, of, 8, 413, points, stood, for, nearly, two, decades, even, more, remarkably, because, someone, had, stolen, his, shoes, just, before, he, was, due, to, compete, he, found, a, mismatched, pair, of, replacements, including, one, from, a, trash, can, and, won, the, gold, medal, wearing, them, overall, thorpe, won, eight, of, the, 15, individual, events, comprising, the, pentathlon, and, decathlon, as, was, the, custom, of, the, day, the, medals, were, presented, to, the, athletes, during, the, closing, ceremonies, of, the, games, along, with, the, two, gold, medals, thorpe, also, received, two, challenge, prizes, which, had, been, donated, by, king, gustav, v, of, sweden, for, the, decathlon, and, czar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, for, the, pentathlon, several, sources, recount, that, when, awarding, thorpe, his, prize, king, gustav, said, you, sir, are, the, greatest, athlete, in, the, world, to, which, thorpe, replied, thanks, king, thorpe, biographer, kate, buford, suggests, that, the, story, is, apocryphal, as, she, believes, that, such, a, comment, would, have, been, out, of, character, for, a, man, who, was, highly, uncomfortable, in, public, ceremonies, and, hated, to, stand, out, the, anecdote, appeared, in, newspapers, by, 1948, 36, years, after, his, appearance, in, the, olympics, and, time, for, myth, making, and, in, books, as, early, as, 1952, thorpe, s, successes, were, followed, in, the, united, states, on, the, olympic, team, s, return, thorpe, was, the, star, attraction, in, a, ticker, tape, parade, on, broadway, he, remembered, later, i, heard, people, yelling, my, name, and, i, couldn, t, realize, how, one, fellow, could, have, so, many, friends, apart, from, his, track, and, field, appearances, thorpe, also, played, in, one, of, two, exhibition, baseball, games, at, the, 1912, olympics, which, featured, two, teams, composed, mostly, of, u, s, track, and, field, athletes, thorpe, had, previous, experience, in, the, sport, as, the, public, soon, learned, after, his, victories, at, the, olympic, games, in, sweden, on, september, 2, 1912, thorpe, returned, to, celtic, park, the, home, of, the, irish, american, athletic, club, in, queens, new, york, where, he, had, qualified, four, months, earlier, for, the, olympic, games, to, compete, in, the, amateur, athletic, union, s, all, around, championship, competing, against, bruno, brodd, of, the, irish, american, athletic, club, and, john, l, bredemus, of, princeton, university, he, won, seven, of, the, ten, events, contested, and, came, in, second, in, the, remaining, three, with, a, total, point, score, of, 7, 476, points, thorpe, broke, the, previous, record, of, 7, 385, points, set, in, 1909, also, at, celtic, park, by, martin, sheridan, the, champion, athlete, of, the, irish, american, athletic, club, sheridan, a, five, time, olympic, gold, medalist, was, present, to, watch, his, record, broken, he, approached, thorpe, after, the, event, and, shook, his, hand, saying, jim, my, boy, you, re, a, great, man, i, never, expect, to, look, upon, a, finer, athlete, he, told, a, reporter, from, new, york, world, thorpe, is, the, greatest, athlete, that, ever, lived, he, has, me, beaten, fifty, ways, even, when, i, was, in, my, prime, i, could, not, do, what, he, did, today, in, 1912, strict, rules, regarding, amateurism, were, in, effect, for, athletes, participating, in, the, olympics, athletes, who, received, money, prizes, for, competitions, were, sports, teachers, or, had, competed, previously, against, professionals, were, not, considered, amateurs, they, were, barred, from, competition, in, late, january, 1913, the, worcester, telegram, reported, that, thorpe, had, played, semi, professional, baseball, before, the, olympics, and, other, u, s, newspapers, followed, up, the, story, thorpe, had, played, semi, professional, baseball, in, the, eastern, carolina, league, for, rocky, mount, north, carolina, in, 1909, and, 1910, receiving, meager, pay, reportedly, as, little, as, us, 2, 65, today, per, game, and, as, much, as, us, 35, 1, 145, per, week, college, players, in, fact, regularly, spent, summers, playing, professionally, in, order, to, earn, some, money, but, most, used, aliases, unlike, thorpe, although, the, public, did, not, seem, to, care, much, about, thorpe, s, past, the, amateur, athletic, union, aau, and, especially, its, secretary, james, edward, sullivan, took, the, case, very, seriously, thorpe, wrote, a, letter, to, sullivan, in, which, he, admitted, playing, professional, baseball, i, hope, i, will, be, partly, excused, by, the, fact, that, i, was, simply, an, indian, schoolboy, and, did, not, know, all, about, such, things, in, fact, i, did, not, know, that, i, was, doing, wrong, because, i, was, doing, what, i, knew, several, other, college, men, had, done, except, that, they, did, not, use, their, own, names, his, letter, did, not, help, the, aau, decided, to, withdraw, thorpe, s, amateur, status, retroactively, later, that, year, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, unanimously, decided, to, strip, thorpe, of, his, olympic, titles, medals, and, awards, and, declare, him, a, professional, although, thorpe, had, played, for, money, the, aau, and, ioc, did, not, follow, their, own, rules, for, disqualification, the, rulebook, for, the, 1912, olympics, stated, that, protests, had, to, be, made, within, 30, days, from, the, closing, ceremonies, of, the, games, the, first, newspaper, reports, did, not, appear, until, january, 1913, about, six, months, after, the, stockholm, games, had, concluded, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, thorpe, was, known, to, have, played, semi, professional, baseball, before, the, olympics, but, the, aau, had, ignored, the, issue, until, being, confronted, with, it, in, 1913, the, only, positive, aspect, of, this, affair, for, thorpe, was, that, as, soon, as, the, news, was, reported, that, he, had, been, declared, a, professional, he, received, offers, from, professional, sports, clubs, in, 1910, thorpe, had, the, unusual, status, of, a, sought, after, free, agent, at, the, major, league, level, during, the, era, of, the, reserve, clause, because, the, minor, league, team, that, last, held, his, contract, had, disbanded, that, year, so, he, was, free, to, choose, which, baseball, team, to, play, for, in, january, 1913, he, turned, down, a, starting, position, with, the, st, louis, browns, then, at, the, bottom, of, the, american, league, thorpe, signed, with, the, new, york, giants, baseball, club, in, 1913, the, defending, 1912, national, league, champion, with, thorpe, playing, in, 19, of, their, 151, games, they, repeated, as, the, 1913, national, league, champions, immediately, following, the, giants, october, loss, in, the, 1913, world, series, thorpe, and, the, giants, joined, the, chicago, white, sox, for, a, world, tour, barnstorming, across, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, thorpe, was, the, celebrity, of, the, tour, thorpe, s, presence, increased, the, publicity, attendance, and, gate, receipts, for, the, tour, he, met, with, pope, pius, x, and, abbas, ii, hilmi, bey, the, last, khedive, of, egypt, and, played, before, 20, 000, people, in, london, including, king, george, v, thorpe, was, the, last, man, to, compete, in, both, the, olympics, in, a, non, baseball, sport, and, major, league, baseball, before, eddy, alvarez, did, the, same, in, 2020, thorpe, played, sporadically, with, the, giants, as, an, outfielder, for, three, seasons, after, playing, in, the, minor, leagues, with, the, milwaukee, brewers, in, 1916, he, returned, to, the, giants, in, 1917, he, was, sold, to, the, cincinnati, reds, early, in, the, season, in, the, double, no, hitter, between, fred, toney, of, the, reds, and, hippo, vaughn, of, the, chicago, cubs, thorpe, drove, in, the, winning, run, in, the, 10th, inning, late, in, the, season, he, was, sold, back, to, the, giants, again, he, played, sporadically, for, them, in, 1918, before, being, traded, to, the, boston, braves, on, may, 21, 1919, for, pat, ragan, in, his, career, he, amassed, 91, runs, scored, 82, runs, batted, in, and, a, 252, batting, average, over, 289, games, he, continued, to, play, minor, league, baseball, until, 1922, and, once, played, for, the, minor, league, toledo, mud, hens, thorpe, had, not, abandoned, football, either, he, first, played, professional, football, in, 1913, as, a, member, of, the, indiana, based, pine, village, pros, a, team, that, had, a, several, season, winning, streak, against, local, teams, during, the, 1910s, he, signed, with, the, canton, bulldogs, in, 1915, they, paid, him, 250, 7, 530, a, game, a, tremendous, wage, at, the, time, before, signing, him, canton, was, averaging, 1, 200, fans, a, game, but, 8, 000, showed, up, for, thorpe, s, debut, against, the, massillon, tigers, the, team, won, titles, in, 1916, 1917, and, 1919, thorpe, reportedly, ended, the, 1919, championship, game, by, kicking, a, wind, assisted, 95, yard, punt, from, his, team, s, own, 5, yard, line, effectively, putting, the, game, out, of, reach, in, 1920, the, bulldogs, were, one, of, 14, teams, to, form, the, american, professional, football, association, which, became, the, national, football, league, nfl, two, years, later, thorpe, was, nominally, their, first, president, but, spent, most, of, the, year, playing, for, canton, a, year, later, he, was, replaced, as,
