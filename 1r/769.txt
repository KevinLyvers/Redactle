in, later, writings, the, ens, s, doctor, examined, foucault, s, state, of, mind, suggesting, that, his, suicidal, tendencies, emerged, from, the, distress, surrounding, his, homosexuality, because,

also, indulging, in, drug, use, according, to, biographer, james, miller, he, enjoyed, the, thrill, and, sense, of, danger, that, these, activities, offered, him, although, studying, various,

french, communist, party, foucault, did, so, in, 1950, but, never, became, particularly, active, in, its, activities, and, never, adopted, an, orthodox, marxist, viewpoint, rejecting, core, marxist, tenets, such, as, class, struggle, he, soon, became, dissatisfied, with, the, bigotry, that, he, experienced, within, the, party, s, ranks, he, personally, faced, homophobia, and, was, appalled, by, the, anti, semitism, exhibited, during, the, 1952, 53, doctors, plot, in, the, soviet, union, he, left, the, communist, party, in, 1953, but, remained, althusser, s, friend, and, defender, for, the,

althusser, s, invitation, in, paris, he, shared, a, flat, with, his, brother, who, was, training, to, become, a, surgeon, but, for, three, days, in, the, week, commuted, to, the, northern, town, of, lille, teaching, psychology, at, the, universit, de, lille, from, 1953, to, 1954, many, of, his, students, liked, his, lecturing, style, meanwhile, he, continued, working, on, his, thesis, visiting, the, biblioth, que, nationale, every, day, to, read, the, work, of, psychologists, like, ivan, pavlov, jean, piaget, and, karl, jaspers, undertaking, research, at, the, psychiatric, institute, of,

embracing, the, parisian, avant, garde, foucault, entered, into, a, romantic, relationship, with, the, serialist, composer, jean, barraqu, together, they, tried, to, produce, their, greatest, work, heavily, used, recreational, drugs, and, engaged, in, sado, masochistic, sexual, activity, in, august, 1953, foucault, and, barraqu, holidayed, in, italy, where, the, philosopher, immersed, himself, in, untimely, meditations, 1873, 1876, a, set, of, four, essays, by, the, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, later, describing, nietzsche, s, work, as, a, revelation, he, felt, that, reading, the, book, deeply, affected, him, being, a, watershed, moment, in, his, life, foucault, subsequently, experienced, another, groundbreaking, self, revelation, when, watching, a, parisian, performance, of, samuel, beckett, s, new, play, waiting, for, godot, in, 1953, interested, in, literature, foucault, was, an, avid, reader, of, the, philosopher, maurice, blanchot, s, book, reviews, published, in, nouvelle, revue, fran, aise, enamoured, of, blanchot, s, literary, style, and, critical, theories, in, later, works, he, adopted, blanchot, s, technique, of, interviewing, himself, foucault, also, came, across, hermann, broch, s, 1945, novel, the, death, of, virgil, a, work, that, obsessed, both, him, and, barraqu, while, the, latter, attempted, to, convert, the, work, into, an, epic, opera, foucault, admired, broch, s, text, for, its, portrayal, of, death, as, an, affirmation, of, life, the, couple, took, a, mutual, interest, in, the, work, of, such, authors, as, the, marquis, de, sade, fyodor, dostoyevsky, franz, kafka, and, jean, genet, all, of, whose, works, explored, the, themes, of, sex, and, violence, i, belong, to, that, generation, who, as, students, had, before, their, eyes, and, were, limited, by, a, horizon, consisting, of, marxism, phenomenology, and, existentialism, for, me, the, break, was, first, beckett, s, waiting, for, godot, a, breathtaking, performance, interested, in, the, work, of, swiss, psychologist, ludwig, binswanger, foucault, aided, family, friend, jacqueline, verdeaux, in, translating, his, works, into, french, foucault, was, particularly, interested, in, binswanger, s, studies, of, ellen, west, who, like, himself, had, a, deep, obsession, with, suicide, eventually, killing, herself, in, 1954, foucault, authored, an, introduction, to, binswanger, s, paper, dream, and, existence, in, which, he, argued, that, dreams, constituted, the, birth, of, the, world, or, the, heart, laid, bare, expressing, the, mind, s, deepest, desires, that, same, year, foucault, published, his, first, book, maladie, mentale, et, personalit, mental, illness, and, personality, in, which, he, exhibited, his, influence, from, both, marxist, and, heideggerian, thought, covering, a, wide, range, of, subject, matter, from, the, reflex, psychology, of, pavlov, to, the, classic, psychoanalysis, of, freud, referencing, the, work, of, sociologists, and, anthropologists, such, as, mile, durkheim, and, margaret, mead, he, presented, his, theory, that, illness, was, culturally, relative, biographer, james, miller, noted, that, while, the, book, exhibited, erudition, and, evident, intelligence, it, lacked, the, kind, of, fire, and, flair, which, foucault, exhibited, in, subsequent, works, it, was, largely, critically, ignored, receiving, only, one, review, at, the, time, foucault, grew, to, despise, it, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, prevent, its, republication, and, translation, into, english, foucault, spent, the, next, five, years, abroad, first, in, sweden, working, as, cultural, diplomat, at, the, university, of, uppsala, a, job, obtained, through, his, acquaintance, with, historian, of, religion, georges, dum, zil, at, uppsala, he, was, appointed, a, reader, in, french, language, and, literature, while, simultaneously, working, as, director, of, the, maison, de, france, thus, opening, the, possibility, of, a, cultural, diplomatic, career, although, finding, it, difficult, to, adjust, to, the, nordic, gloom, and, long, winters, he, developed, close, friendships, with, two, frenchmen, biochemist, jean, fran, ois, miquel, and, physicist, jacques, papet, l, pine, and, entered, into, romantic, and, sexual, relationships, with, various, men, in, uppsala, he, became, known, for, his, heavy, alcohol, consumption, and, reckless, driving, in, his, new, jaguar, car, in, spring, 1956, barraqu, broke, from, his, relationship, with, foucault, announcing, that, he, wanted, to, leave, the, vertigo, of, madness, in, uppsala, foucault, spent, much, of, his, spare, time, in, the, university, s, carolina, rediviva, library, making, use, of, their, bibliotheca, walleriana, collection, of, texts, on, the, history, of, medicine, for, his, ongoing, research, finishing, his, doctoral, thesis, foucault, hoped, that, uppsala, university, would, accept, it, but, sten, lindroth, a, positivistic, historian, of, science, there, remained, unimpressed, asserting, that, it, was, full, of, speculative, generalisations, and, was, a, poor, work, of, history, he, refused, to, allow, foucault, to, be, awarded, a, doctorate, at, uppsala, in, part, because, of, this, rejection, foucault, left, sweden, later, foucault, admitted, that, the, work, was, a, first, draft, with, certain, lack, of, quality, again, at, dum, zil, s, behest, in, october, 1958, foucault, arrived, in, the, capital, of, the, polish, people, s, republic, warsaw, and, took, charge, of, the, university, of, warsaw, s, centre, fran, ais, foucault, found, life, in, poland, difficult, due, to, the, lack, of, material, goods, and, services, following, the, destruction, of, the, second, world, war, witnessing, the, aftermath, of, the, polish, october, of, 1956, when, students, had, protested, against, the, governing, communist, polish, united, workers, party, he, felt, that, most, poles, despised, their, government, as, a, puppet, regime, of, the, soviet, union, and, thought, that, the, system, ran, badly, considering, the, university, a, liberal, enclave, he, traveled, the, country, giving, lectures, proving, popular, he, adopted, the, position, of, de, facto, cultural, attach, like, france, and, sweden, poland, legally, tolerated, but, socially, frowned, on, homosexual, activity, and, foucault, undertook, relationships, with, a, number, of, men, one, was, with, a, polish, security, agent, who, hoped, to, trap, foucault, in, an, embarrassing, situation, which, therefore, would, reflect, badly, on, the, french, embassy, wracked, in, diplomatic, scandal, he, was, ordered, to, leave, poland, for, a, new, destination, various, positions, were, available, in, west, germany, and, so, foucault, relocated, to, the, institut, fran, ais, hamburg, where, he, served, as, director, in, 1958, 1960, teaching, the, same, courses, he, had, given, in, uppsala, and, warsaw, spending, much, time, in, the, reeperbahn, red, light, district, he, entered, into, a, relationship, with, a, transvestite, histoire, de, la, folie, is, not, an, easy, text, to, read, and, it, defies, attempts, to, summarise, its, contents, foucault, refers, to, a, bewildering, variety, of, sources, ranging, from, well, known, authors, such, as, erasmus, and, moli, re, to, archival, documents, and, forgotten, figures, in, the, history, of, medicine, and, psychiatry, his, erudition, derives, from, years, pondering, to, cite, poe, over, many, a, quaint, and, curious, volume, of, forgotten, lore, and, his, learning, is, not, always, worn, lightly, in, west, germany, foucault, completed, in, 1960, his, primary, thesis, th, se, principale, for, his, state, doctorate, titled, folie, et, d, raison, histoire, de, la, folie, l, ge, classique, trans, madness, and, insanity, history, of, madness, in, the, classical, age, a, philosophical, work, based, upon, his, studies, into, the, history, of, medicine, the, book, discussed, how, west, european, society, had, dealt, with, madness, arguing, that, it, was, a, social, construct, distinct, from, mental, illness, foucault, traces, the, evolution, of, the, concept, of, madness, through, three, phases, the, renaissance, the, later, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, the, modern, experience, the, work, alludes, to, the, work, of, french, poet, and, playwright, antonin, artaud, who, exerted, a, strong, influence, over, foucault, s, thought, at, the, time, histoire, de, la, folie, was, an, expansive, work, consisting, of, 943, pages, of, text, followed, by, appendices, and, a, bibliography, foucault, submitted, it, at, the, university, of, paris, although, the, university, s, regulations, for, awarding, a, state, doctorate, required, the, submission, of, both, his, main, thesis, and, a, shorter, complementary, thesis, obtaining, a, doctorate, in, france, at, the, period, was, a, multi, step, process, the, first, step, was, to, obtain, a, rapporteur, or, sponsor, for, the, work, foucault, chose, georges, canguilhem, the, second, was, to, find, a, publisher, and, as, a, result, folie, et, d, raison, was, published, in, french, in, may, 1961, by, the, company, plon, whom, foucault, chose, over, presses, universitaires, de, france, after, being, rejected, by, gallimard, in, 1964, a, heavily, abridged, version, was, published, as, a, mass, market, paperback, then, translated, into, english, for, publication, the, following, year, as, madness, and, civilization, a, history, of, insanity, in, the, age, of, reason, folie, et, d, raison, received, a, mixed, reception, in, france, and, in, foreign, journals, focusing, on, french, affairs, although, it, was, critically, acclaimed, by, maurice, blanchot, michel, serres, roland, barthes, gaston, bachelard, and, fernand, braudel, it, was, largely, ignored, by, the, leftist, press, much, to, foucault, s, disappointment, it, was, notably, criticised, for, advocating, metaphysics, by, young, philosopher, jacques, derrida, in, a, march, 1963, lecture, at, the, university, of, paris, responding, with, a, vicious, retort, foucault, criticised, derrida, s, interpretation, of, ren, descartes, the, two, remained, bitter, rivals, until, reconciling, in, 1981, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, work, became, a, significant, influence, on, the, anti, psychiatry, movement, during, the, 1960s, foucault, took, a, mixed, approach, to, this, associating, with, a, number, of, anti, psychiatrists, but, arguing, that, most, of, them, misunderstood, his, work, foucault, s, secondary, thesis, th, se, compl, mentaire, written, in, hamburg, between, 1959, and, 1960, was, a, translation, and, commentary, on, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, s, anthropology, from, a, pragmatic, point, of, view, 1798, the, thesis, was, titled, introduction, l, anthropologie, largely, consisting, of, foucault, s, discussion, of, textual, dating, an, archaeology, of, the, kantian, text, he, rounded, off, the, thesis, with, an, evocation, of, nietzsche, his, biggest, philosophical, influence, this, work, s, rapporteur, was, foucault, s, old, tutor, and, then, director, of, the, ens, hyppolite, who, was, well, acquainted, with, german, philosophy, after, both, theses, were, championed, and, reviewed, he, underwent, his, public, defense, of, his, doctoral, thesis, soutenance, de, th, se, on, 20, may, 1961, the, academics, responsible, for, reviewing, his, work, were, concerned, about, the, unconventional, nature, of, his, major, thesis, reviewer, henri, gouhier, noted, that, it, was, not, a, conventional, work, of, history, making, sweeping, generalisations, without, sufficient, particular, argument, and, that, foucault, clearly, thinks, in, allegories, they, all, agreed, however, that, the, overall, project, was, of, merit, awarding, foucault, his, doctorate, despite, reservations, in, october, 1960, foucault, took, a, tenured, post, in, philosophy, at, the, university, of, clermont, ferrand, commuting, to, the, city, every, week, from, paris, where, he, lived, in, a, high, rise, block, on, the, rue, du, dr, finlay, responsible, for, teaching, psychology, which, was, subsumed, within, the, philosophy, department, he, was, considered, a, fascinating, but, rather, traditional, teacher, at, clermont, the, department, was, run, by, jules, vuillemin, who, soon, developed, a, friendship, with, foucault, foucault, then, took, vuillemin, s, job, when, the, latter, was, elected, to, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, 1962, in, this, position, foucault, took, a, dislike, to, another, staff, member, whom, he, considered, stupid, roger, garaudy, a, senior, figure, in, the, communist, party, foucault, made, life, at, the, university, difficult, for, garaudy, leading, the, latter, to, transfer, to, poitiers, foucault, also, caused, controversy, by, securing, a, university, job, for, his, lover, the, philosopher, daniel, defert, with, whom, he, retained, a, non, monogamous, relationship, for, the, rest, of, his, life, foucault, maintained, a, keen, interest, in, literature, publishing, reviews, in, literary, journals, including, tel, quel, and, nouvelle, revue, fran, aise, and, sitting, on, the, editorial, board, of, critique, in, may, 1963, he, published, a, book, devoted, to, poet, novelist, and, playwright, raymond, roussel, it, was, written, in, under, two, months, published, by, gallimard, and, was, described, by, biographer, david, macey, as, a, very, personal, book, that, resulted, from, a, love, affair, with, roussel, s, work, it, was, published, in, english, in, 1983, as, death, and, the, labyrinth, the, world, of, raymond, roussel, receiving, few, reviews, it, was, largely, ignored, that, same, year, he, published, a, sequel, to, folie, et, d, raison, titled, naissance, de, la, clinique, subsequently, translated, as, the, birth, of, the, clinic, an, archaeology, of, medical, perception, shorter, than, its, predecessor, it, focused, on, the, changes, that, the, medical, establishment, underwent, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, like, his, preceding, work, naissance, de, la, clinique, was, largely, critically, ignored, but, later, gained, a, cult, following, it, was, of, interest, within, the, field, of, medical, ethics, as, it, considered, the, ways, in, which, the, history, of, medicine, and, hospitals, and, the, training, that, those, working, within, them, receive, bring, about, a, particular, way, of, looking, at, the, body, the, medical, gaze, foucault, was, also, selected, to, be, among, the, eighteen, man, commission, that, assembled, between, november, 1963, and, march, 1964, to, discuss, university, reforms, that, were, to, be, implemented, by, christian, fouchet, the, gaullist, minister, of, national, education, implemented, in, 1967, they, brought, staff, strikes, and, student, protests, in, april, 1966, gallimard, published, foucault, s, les, mots, et, les, choses, words, and, things, later, translated, as, the, order, of, things, an, archaeology, of, the, human, sciences, exploring, how, man, came, to, be, an, object, of, knowledge, it, argued, that, all, periods, of, history, have, possessed, certain, underlying, conditions, of, truth, that, constituted, what, was, acceptable, as, scientific, discourse, foucault, argues, that, these, conditions, of, discourse, have, changed, over, time, from, one, period, s, pist, m, to, another, although, designed, for, a, specialist, audience, the, work, gained, media, attention, becoming, a, surprise, bestseller, in, france, appearing, at, the, height, of, interest, in, structuralism, foucault, was, quickly, grouped, with, scholars, such, as, jacques, lacan, claude, l, vi, strauss, and, roland, barthes, as, the, latest, wave, of, thinkers, set, to, topple, the, existentialism, popularized, by, jean, paul, sartre, although, initially, accepting, this, description, foucault, soon, vehemently, rejected, it, because, he, never, posited, a, universal, theory, of, discourse, but, rather, sought, to, describe, the, historical, forms, taken, by, discoursive, practices, foucault, and, sartre, regularly, criticised, one, another, in, the, press, both, sartre, and, simone, de, beauvoir, attacked, foucault, s, ideas, as, bourgeois, while, foucault, retaliated, against, their, marxist, beliefs, by, proclaiming, that, marxism, exists, in, nineteenth, century, thought, as, a, fish, exists, in, water, that, is, it, ceases, to, breathe, anywhere, else, i, lived, for, two, and, a, half, years, it, made, a, real, impression, i, was, present, for, large, violent, student, riots, that, preceded, by, several, weeks, what, happened, in, may, in, france, this, was, march, 1968, the, unrest, lasted, a, whole, year, strikes, courses, suspended, arrests, and, in, march, a, general, strike, by, the, students, the, police, came, into, the, university, beat, up, the, students, wounded, several, of, them, seriously, and, started, making, arrests, i, have, to, say, that, i, was, tremendously, impressed, by, those, young, men, and, women, who, took, terrible, risks, by, writing, or, distributing, tracts, or, calling, for, strikes, the, ones, who, really, risked, losing, their, freedom, it, was, a, political, experience, for, me, in, september, 1966, foucault, took, a, position, teaching, psychology, at, the, university, of, tunis, in, tunisia, his, decision, to, do, so, was, largely, because, his, lover, defert, had, been, posted, to, the, country, as, part, of, his, national, service, foucault, moved, a, few, kilometres, from, tunis, to, the, village, of, sidi, bou, sa, d, where, fellow, academic, g, rard, deledalle, lived, with, his, wife, soon, after, his, arrival, foucault, announced, that, tunisia, was, blessed, by, history, a, nation, which, deserves, to, live, forever, because, it, was, where, hannibal, and, st, augustine, lived, his, lectures, at, the, university, proved, very, popular, and, were, well, attended, although, many, young, students, were, enthusiastic, about, his, teaching, they, were, critical, of, what, they, believed, to, be, his, right, wing, political, views, viewing, him, as, a, representative, of, gaullist, technocracy, even, though, he, considered, himself, a, leftist, foucault, was, in, tunis, during, the, anti, government, and, pro, palestinian, riots, that, rocked, the, city, in, june, 1967, and, which, continued, for, a, year, although, highly, critical, of, the, violent, ultra, nationalistic, and, anti, semitic, nature, of, many, protesters, he, used, his, status, to, try, to, prevent, some, of, his, militant, leftist, students, from, being, arrested, and, tortured, for, their, role, in, the, agitation, he, hid, their, printing, press, in, his, garden, and, tried, to, testify, on, their, behalf, at, their, trials, but, was, prevented, when, the, trials, became, closed, door, events, while, in, tunis, foucault, continued, to, write, inspired, by, a, correspondence, with, the, surrealist, artist, ren, magritte, foucault, started, to, write, a, book, about, the, impressionist, artist, douard, manet, but, never, completed, it, in, 1968, foucault, returned, to, paris, moving, into, an, apartment, on, the, rue, de, vaugirard, after, the, may, 1968, student, protests, minister, of, education, edgar, faure, responded, by, founding, new, universities, with, greater, autonomy, most, prominent, of, these, was, the, centre, exp, rimental, de, vincennes, in, vincennes, on, the, outskirts, of, paris, a, group, of, prominent, academics, were, asked, to, select, teachers, to, run, the, centre, s, departments, and, canguilheim, recommended, foucault, as, head, of, the, philosophy, department, becoming, a, tenured, professor, of, vincennes, foucault, s, desire, was, to, obtain, the, best, in, french, philosophy, today, for, his, department, employing, michel, serres, judith, miller, alain, badiou, jacques, ranci, re, fran, ois, regnault, henri, weber, tienne, balibar, and, fran, ois, ch, telet, most, of, them, were, marxists, or, ultra, left, activists, lectures, began, at, the, university, in, january, 1969, and, straight, away, its, students, and, staff, including, foucault, were, involved, in, occupations, and, clashes, with, police, resulting, in, arrests, in, february, foucault, gave, a, speech, denouncing, police, provocation, to, protesters, at, the, maison, de, la, mutualit, such, actions, marked, foucault, s, embrace, of, the, ultra, left, undoubtedly, influenced, by, defert, who, had, gained, a, job, at, vincennes, sociology, department, and, who, had, become, a, maoist, most, of, the, courses, at, foucault, s, philosophy, department, were, marxist, leninist, oriented, although, foucault, himself, gave, courses, on, nietzsche, the, end, of, metaphysics, and, the, discourse, of, sexuality, which, were, highly, popular, and, over, subscribed, while, the, right, wing, press, was, heavily, critical, of, this, new, institution, new, minister, of, education, olivier, guichard, was, angered, by, its, ideological, bent, and, the, lack, of, exams, with, students, being, awarded, degrees, in, a, haphazard, manner, he, refused, national, accreditation, of, the, department, s, degrees, resulting, in, a, public, rebuttal, from, foucault, foucault, desired, to, leave, vincennes, and, become, a, fellow, of, the, prestigious, coll, ge, de, france, he, requested, to, join, taking, up, a, chair, in, what, he, called, the, history, of, systems, of, thought, and, his, request, was, championed, by, members, dum, zil, hyppolite, and, vuillemin, in, november, 1969, when, an, opening, became, available, foucault, was, elected, to, the, coll, ge, though, with, opposition, by, a, large, minority, he, gave, his, inaugural, lecture, in, december, 1970, which, was, subsequently, published, as, l, ordre, du, discours, the, discourse, of, language, he, was, obliged, to, give, 12, weekly, lectures, a, year, and, did, so, for, the, rest, of, his, life, covering, the, topics, that, he, was, researching, at, the, time, these, became, one, of, the, events, of, parisian, intellectual, life, and, were, repeatedly, packed, out, events, on, mondays, he, also, gave, seminars, to, a, group, of, students, many, of, them, became, a, foulcauldian, tribe, who, worked, with, him, on, his, research, he, enjoyed, this, teamwork, and, collective, research, and, together, they, published, a, number, of, short, books, working, at, the, coll, ge, allowed, him, to, travel, widely, giving, lectures, in, brazil, japan, canada, and, the, united, states, over, the, next, 14, years, in, 1970, and, 1972, foucault, served, as, a, professor, in, the, french, department, of, the, university, at, buffalo, in, buffalo, new, york, in, may, 1971, foucault, co, founded, the, groupe, d, information, sur, les, prisons, gip, along, with, historian, pierre, vidal, naquet, and, journalist, jean, marie, domenach, the, gip, aimed, to, investigate, and, expose, poor, conditions, in, prisons, and, give, prisoners, and, ex, prisoners, a, voice, in, french, society, it, was, highly, critical, of, the, penal, system, believing, that, it, converted, petty, criminals, into, hardened, delinquents, the, gip, gave, press, conferences, and, staged, protests, surrounding, the, events, of, the, toul, prison, riot, in, december, 1971, alongside, other, prison, riots, that, it, sparked, off, in, doing, so, it, faced, a, police, crackdown, and, repeated, arrests, the, group, became, active, across, france, with, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, members, but, disbanded, before, 1974, also, campaigning, against, the, death, penalty, foucault, co, authored, a, short, book, on, the, case, of, the, convicted, murderer, pierre, rivi, re, after, his, research, into, the, penal, system, foucault, published, surveiller, et, punir, naissance, de, la, prison, discipline, and, punish, the, birth, of, the, prison, in, 1975, offering, a, history, of, the, system, in, western, europe, in, it, foucault, examines, the, penal, evolution, away, from, corporal, and, capital, punishment, to, the, penitentiary, system, that, began, in, europe, and, the, united, states, around, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, biographer, didier, eribon, described, it, as, perhaps, the, finest, of, foucault, s, works, and, it, was, well, received, foucault, was, also, active, in, anti, racist, campaigns, in, november, 1971, he, was, a, leading, figure, in, protests, following, the, perceived, racist, killing, of, arab, migrant, djellali, ben, ali, in, this, he, worked, alongside, his, old, rival, sartre, the, journalist, claude, mauriac, and, one, of, his, literary, heroes, jean, genet, this, campaign, was, formalised, as, the, committee, for, the, defence, of, the, rights, of, immigrants, but, there, was, tension, at, their, meetings, as, foucault, opposed, the, anti, israeli, sentiment, of, many, arab, workers, and, maoist, activists, at, a, december, 1972, protest, against, the, police, killing, of, algerian, worker, mohammad, diab, both, foucault, and, genet, were, arrested, resulting, in, widespread, publicity, foucault, was, also, involved, in, founding, the, agence, de, press, lib, ration, apl, a, group, of, leftist, journalists, who, intended, to, cover, news, stories, neglected, by, the, mainstream, press, in, 1973, they, established, the, daily, newspaper, lib, ration, and, foucault, suggested, that, they, establish, committees, across, france, to, collect, news, and, distribute, the, paper, and, advocated, a, column, known, as, the, chronicle, of, the, workers, memory, to, allow, workers, to, express, their, opinions, foucault, wanted, an, active, journalistic, role, in, the, paper, but, this, proved, untenable, and, he, soon, became, disillusioned, with, lib, ration, believing, that, it, distorted, the, facts, he, did, not, publish, in, it, until, 1980, in, 1975, he, had, an, lsd, experience, with, simeon, wade, and, michael, stoneman, in, death, valley, california, and, later, wrote, it, was, the, greatest, experience, of, his, life, and, that, it, profoundly, changed, his, life, and, his, work, in, front, of, zabriskie, point, they, took, lsd, while, listening, to, a, well, prepared, music, program, richard, strauss, s, four, last, songs, followed, by, charles, ives, s, three, places, in, new, england, ending, with, a, few, avant, garde, pieces, by, stockhausen, according, to, wade, as, soon, as, he, came, back, to, paris, foucault, scrapped, the, second, the, history, of, sexuality, s, manuscript, and, totally, rethought, the, whole, project, in, 1976, gallimard, published, foucault, s, histoire, de, la, sexualit, la, volont, de, savoir, the, history, of, sexuality, the, will, to, knowledge, a, short, book, exploring, what, foucault, called, the, repressive, hypothesis, it, revolved, largely, around, the, concept, of, power, rejecting, both, marxist, and, freudian, theory, foucault, intended, it, as, the, first, in, a, seven, volume, exploration, of, the, subject, histoire, de, la, sexualit, was, a, best, seller, in, france, and, gained, positive, press, but, lukewarm, intellectual, interest, something, that, upset, foucault, who, felt, that, many, misunderstood, his, hypothesis, he, soon, became, dissatisfied, with, gallimard, after, being, offended, by, senior, staff, member, pierre, nora, along, with, paul, veyne, and, fran, ois, wahl, foucault, launched, a, new, series, of, academic, books, known, as, des, travaux, some, works, through, the, company, seuil, which, he, hoped, would, improve, the, state, of, academic, research, in, france, he, also, produced, introductions, for, the, memoirs, of, herculine, barbin, and, my, secret, life, foucault, s, histoire, de, la, sexualit, concentrates, on, the, relation, between, truth, and, sex, he, defines, truth, as, a, system, of, ordered, procedures, for, the, production, distribution, regulation, circulation, and, operation, of, statements, through, this, system, of, truth, power, structures, are, created, and, enforced, though, foucault, s, definition, of, truth, may, differ, from, other, sociologists, before, and, after, him, his, work, with, truth, in, relation, to, power, structures, such, as, sexuality, has, left, a, profound, mark, on, social, science, theory, in, his, work, he, examines, the, heightened, curiosity, regarding, sexuality, that, induced, a, world, of, perversion, during, the, elite, capitalist, 18th, and, 19th, century, in, the, western, world, according, to, foucault, in, history, of, sexuality, society, of, the, modern, age, is, symbolized, by, the, conception, of, sexual, discourses, and, their, union, with, the, system, of, truth, in, the, world, of, perversion, including, extramarital, affairs, homosexual, behavior, and, other, such, sexual, promiscuities, foucault, concludes, that, sexual, relations, of, the, kind, are, constructed, around, producing, the, truth, sex, became, not, only, a, means, of, pleasure, but, an, issue, of, truth, sex, is, what, confines, one, to, darkness, but, also, what, brings, one, to, light, similarly, in, the, history, of, sexuality, society, validates, and, approves, people, based, on, how, closely, they, fit, the, discursive, mold, of, sexual, truth, as, foucault, reminds, us, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, church, was, the, epitome, of, power, structure, within, society, thus, many, aligned, their, personal, virtues, with, those, of, the, church, further, internalizing, their, beliefs, on, the, meaning, of, sex, however, those, who, unify, their, sexual, relation, to, the, truth, become, decreasingly, obliged, to, share, their, internal, views, with, those, of, the, church, they, will, no, longer, see, the, arrangement, of, societal, norms, as, an, effect, of, the, church, s, deep, seated, power, structure, there, exists, an, international, citizenry, that, has, its, rights, and, has, its, duties, and, that, is, committed, to, rise, up, against, every, abuse, of, power, no, matter, who, the, author, no, matter, who, the, victims, after, all, we, are, all, ruled, and, as, such, we, are, in, solidarity, foucault, remained, a, political, activist, focusing, on, protesting, government, abuses, of, human, rights, around, the, world, he, was, a, key, player, in, the, 1975, protests, against, the, spanish, government, who, were, set, to, execute, 11, militants, sentenced, to, death, without, fair, trial, it, was, his, idea, to, travel, to, madrid, with, six, others, to, give, a, press, conference, there, they, were, subsequently, arrested, and, deported, back, to, paris, in, 1977, he, protested, the, extradition, of, klaus, croissant, to, west, germany, and, his, rib, was, fractured, during, clashes, with, riot, police, in, july, that, year, he, organised, an, assembly, of, eastern, bloc, dissidents, to, mark, the, visit, of, soviet, general, secretary, leonid, brezhnev, to, paris, in, 1979, he, campaigned, for, vietnamese, political, dissidents, to, be, granted, asylum, in, france, in, 1977, italian, newspaper, corriere, della, sera, asked, foucault, to, write, a, column, for, them, in, doing, so, in, 1978, he, travelled, to, tehran, in, iran, days, after, the, black, friday, massacre, documenting, the, developing, iranian, revolution, he, met, with, opposition, leaders, such, as, mohammad, kazem, shariatmadari, and, mehdi, bazargan, and, discovered, the, popular, support, for, islamism, returning, to, france, he, was, one, of, the, journalists, who, visited, the, ayatollah, khomeini, before, visiting, tehran, his, articles, expressed, awe, of, khomeini, s, islamist, movement, for, which, he, was, widely, criticised, in, the, french, press, including, by, iranian, expatriates, foucault, s, response, was, that, islamism, was, to, become, a, major, political, force, in, the, region, and, that, the, west, must, treat, it, with, respect, rather, than, hostility, in, april, 1978, foucault, traveled, to, japan, where, he, studied, zen, buddhism, under, omori, sogen, at, the, seionji, temple, in, uenohara, although, remaining, critical, of, power, relations, foucault, expressed, cautious, support, for, the, socialist, party, government, of, fran, ois, mitterrand, following, its, electoral, victory, in, 1981, but, his, support, soon, deteriorated, when, that, party, refused, to, condemn, the, polish, government, s, crackdown, on, the, 1982, demonstrations, in, poland, orchestrated, by, the, solidarity, trade, union, he, and, sociologist, pierre, bourdieu, authored, a, document, condemning, mitterrand, s, inaction, that, was, published, in, lib, ration, and, they, also, took, part, in, large, public, protests, on, the, issue, foucault, continued, to, support, solidarity, and, with, his, friend, simone, signoret, traveled, to, poland, as, part, of, a, m, decins, du, monde, expedition, taking, time, out, to, visit, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, he, continued, his, academic, research, and, in, june, 1984, gallimard, published, the, second, and, third, volumes, of, histoire, de, la, sexualit, volume, two, l, usage, des, plaisirs, dealt, with, the, techniques, of, self, prescribed, by, ancient, greek, pagan, morality, in, relation, to, sexual, ethics, while, volume, three, le, souci, de, soi, explored, the, same, theme, in, the, greek, and, latin, texts, of, the, first, two, centuries, ce, a, fourth, volume, les, aveux, de, la, chair, was, to, examine, sexuality, in, early, christianity, but, it, was, not, finished, in, october, 1980, foucault, became, a, visiting, professor, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, giving, the, howison, lectures, on, truth, and, subjectivity, while, in, november, he, lectured, at, the, humanities, institute, at, new, york, university, his, growing, popularity, in, american, intellectual, circles, was, noted, by, time, magazine, while, foucault, went, on, to, lecture, at, university, of, california, los, angeles, in, 1981, the, university, of, vermont, in, 1982, and, berkeley, again, in, 1983, where, his, lectures, drew, huge, crowds, foucault, spent, many, evenings, in, the, san, francisco, gay, scene, frequenting, sado, masochistic, bathhouses, engaging, in, unprotected, sex, he, praised, sado, masochistic, activity, in, interviews, with, the, gay, press, describing, it, as, the, real, creation, of, new, possibilities, of, pleasure, which, people, had, no, idea, about, previously, foucault, contracted, hiv, and, eventually, developed, aids, little, was, known, of, the, virus, at, the, time, the, first, cases, had, only, been, identified, in, 1980, foucault, initially, referred, to, aids, as, a, dreamed, up, disease, in, summer, 1983, he, developed, a, persistent, dry, cough, which, concerned, friends, in, paris, but, foucault, insisted, it, was, just, a, pulmonary, infection, only, when, hospitalized, was, foucault, correctly, diagnosed, as, being, hiv, positive, treated, with, antibiotics, he, delivered, a, final, set, of, lectures, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, foucault, entered, paris, h, pital, de, la, salp, tri, re, the, same, institution, that, he, had, studied, in, madness, and, civilisation, on, 10, june, 1984, with, neurological, symptoms, complicated, by, sepsis, he, died, in, the, hospital, on, 25, june, on, 26, june, 1984, lib, ration, announced, foucault, s, death, mentioning, the, rumour, that, it, had, been, brought, on, by, aids, the, following, day, le, monde, issued, a, medical, bulletin, cleared, by, his, family, that, made, no, reference, to, hiv, aids, on, 29, june, foucault, s, la, lev, e, du, corps, ceremony, was, held, in, which, the, coffin, was, carried, from, the, hospital, morgue, hundreds, attended, including, activists, and, academic, friends, while, gilles, deleuze, gave, a, speech, using, excerpts, from, the, history, of, sexuality, his, body, was, then, buried, at, vendeuvre, du, poitou, in, a, small, ceremony, soon, after, his, death, foucault, s, partner, daniel, defert, founded, the, first, national, hiv, aids, organisation, in, france, aides, a, play, on, the, french, word, for, help, aide, and, the, english, language, acronym, for, the, disease, on, the, second, anniversary, of, foucault, s, death, defert, publicly, revealed, in, the, advocate, that, foucault, s, death, was, aids, related, foucault, s, first, biographer, didier, eribon, described, the, philosopher, as, a, complex, many, sided, character, and, that, under, one, mask, there, is, always, another, he, also, noted, that, he, exhibited, an, enormous, capacity, for, work, at, the, ens, foucault, s, classmates, unanimously, summed, him, up, as, a, figure, who, was, both, disconcerting, and, strange, and, a, passionate, worker, as, he, aged, his, personality, changed, eribon, noted, that, while, he, was, a, tortured, adolescent, post, 1960, he, had, become, a, radiant, man, relaxed, and, cheerful, even, being, described, by, those, who, worked, with, him, as, a, dandy, he, noted, that, in, 1969, foucault, embodied, the, idea, of, the, militant, intellectual, foucault, was, an, atheist, he, loved, classical, music, particularly, enjoying, the, work, of, johann, sebastian, bach, and, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, and, became, known, for, wearing, turtleneck, sweaters, after, his, death, foucault, s, friend, georges, dum, zil, described, him, as, having, possessed, a, profound, kindness, and, goodness, also, exhibiting, an, intelligence, literally, knew, no, bounds, his, life, partner, daniel, defert, inherited, his, estate, whose, archive, was, sold, in, 2012, to, the, national, library, of, france, for, 3, 8, million, 4, 5, million, in, april, 2021, politically, foucault, was, a, leftist, throughout, much, of, his, life, though, his, particular, stance, within, the, left, often, changed, in, the, early, 1950s, while, never, adopting, an, orthodox, marxist, viewpoint, foucault, had, been, a, member, of, the, french, communist, party, leaving, the, party, after, three, years, as, he, expressed, disgust, in, the, prejudice, within, its, ranks, against, jews, and, homosexuals, after, spending, some, time, working, in, poland, which, was, a, communist, state, ostensibly, governed, by, the, polish, united, workers, party, but, actually, was, an, abject, police, state, satellite, of, the, soviet, union, he, became, further, disillusioned, with, communist, ideology, as, a, result, in, the, early, 1960s, foucault, was, considered, to, be, violently, anticommunist, by, some, of, his, detractors, even, though, he, was, involved, in, leftist, campaigns, along, with, most, of, his, students, and, colleagues, foucault, s, colleague, pierre, bourdieu, summarized, the, philosopher, s, thought, as, a, long, exploration, of, transgression, of, going, beyond, social, limits, always, inseparably, linked, to, knowledge, and, power, the, theme, that, underlies, all, foucault, s, work, is, the, relationship, between, power, and, knowledge, and, how, the, former, is, used, to, control, and, define, the, latter, what, authorities, claim, as, scientific, knowledge, are, really, just, means, of, social, control, foucault, shows, how, for, instance, in, the, eighteenth, century, madness, was, used, to, categorize, and, stigmatize, not, just, the, mentally, ill, but, the, poor, the, sick, the, homeless, and, indeed, anyone, whose, expressions, of, individuality, were, unwelcome, philosopher, philip, stokes, of, the, university, of, reading, noted, that, overall, foucault, s, work, was, dark, and, pessimistic, though, it, does, however, leave, some, room, for, optimism, in, that, it, illustrates, how, the, discipline, of, philosophy, can, be, used, to, highlight, areas, of, domination, in, doing, so, as, stokes, claimed, the, ways, in, which, we, are, being, dominated, become, better, understood, so, that, we, may, strive, to, build, social, structures, that, minimise, this, risk, of, domination, in, all, of, this, development, there, had, to, be, close, attention, to, detail, it, is, the, detail, which, eventually, individualizes, people, later, in, his, life, foucault, explained, that, his, work, was, less, about, analyzing, power, as, a, phenomenon, than, about, trying, to, characterize, the, different, ways, in, which, contemporary, society, has, expressed, the, use, of, power, to, objectivise, subjects, these, have, taken, three, broad, forms, one, involving, scientific, authority, to, classify, and, order, knowledge, about, human, populations, the, second, has, been, to, categorize, and, normalise, human, subjects, by, identifying, madness, illness, physical, features, and, so, on, and, the, third, relates, to, the, manner, in, which, the, impulse, to, fashion, sexual, identities, and, train, one, s, own, body, to, engage, in, routines, and, practices, ends, up, reproducing, certain, patterns, within, a, given, society, in, addition, to, his, philosophical, work, foucault, also, wrote, on, literature, death, and, the, labyrinth, the, world, of, raymond, roussel, published, in, 1963, and, translated, in, english, in, 1986, is, foucault, s, only, book, length, work, on, literature, he, described, it, as, by, far, the, book, i, wrote, most, easily, with, the, greatest, pleasure, and, most, rapidly, foucault, explores, theory, criticism, and, psychology, with, reference, to, the, texts, of, raymond, roussel, one, of, the, first, notable, experimental, writers, foucault, also, gave, a, lecture, responding, to, roland, barthes, famous, essay, the, death, of, the, author, titled, what, is, an, author, in, 1969, later, published, in, full, according, to, literary, theoretician, kornelije, kvas, for, foucault, denying, the, existence, of, a, historical, author, on, account, of, his, her, irrelevance, for, interpretation, is, absurd, for, the, author, is, a, function, of, the, text, that, organizes, its, sense, foucault, s, analysis, of, power, comes, in, two, forms, empirical, and, theoretical, the, empirical, analyses, concern, themselves, with, historical, and, modern, forms, of, power, and, how, these, emerged, from, previous, forms, of, power, foucault, describes, three, types, of, power, in, his, empirical, analyses, sovereign, power, disciplinary, power, and, biopower, foucault, is, generally, critical, of, theories, that, try, to, give, absolute, answers, to, everything, therefore, he, considered, his, own, theory, of, power, to, be, closer, to, a, method, than, a, typical, theory, according, to, foucault, most, people, misunderstand, power, for, this, reason, he, makes, clear, that, power, cannot, be, completely, described, as, foucault, is, not, critical, of, considering, these, phenomena, as, power, but, claims, that, these, theories, of, power, cannot, completely, describe, all, forms, of, power, foucault, also, claims, that, a, liberal, definition, of, power, has, effectively, hidden, other, forms, of, power, to, the, extent, that, people, have, uncritically, accepted, them, foucault, s, power, analysis, begins, on, micro, level, with, singular, force, relations, richard, a, lynch, defines, foucault, s, concept, of, force, relation, as, whatever, in, one, s, social, interactions, that, pushes, urges, or, compels, one, to, do, something, according, to, foucault, force, relations, are, an, effect, of, difference, inequality, or, unbalance, that, exists, in, other, forms, of, relationships, such, as, sexual, or, economic, force, and, power, is, however, not, something, that, a, person, or, group, holds, such, as, in, the, sovereign, definition, of, power, instead, power, is, a, complex, group, of, forces, that, comes, from, everything, and, therefore, exists, everywhere, that, relations, of, power, always, result, from, inequality, difference, or, unbalance, also, means, that, power, always, has, a, goal, or, purpose, power, comes, in, two, forms, tactics, and, strategies, tactics, is, power, on, the, micro, level, which, can, for, example, be, how, a, person, chooses, to, express, themselves, through, their, clothes, strategies, on, the, other, hand, is, power, on, macro, level, which, can, be, the, state, of, fashion, at, any, moment, strategies, consist, of, a, combination, of, tactics, at, the, same, time, power, is, non, subjective, according, to, foucault, this, posits, a, paradox, according, to, lynch, since, someone, has, to, exert, power, while, at, the, same, time, there, can, be, no, someone, exerting, this, power, according, to, lynch, this, paradox, can, be, solved, with, two, observations, according, to, foucault, force, relations, are, constantly, changing, constantly, interacting, with, other, force, relations, which, may, weaken, strengthen, or, change, one, another, foucault, writes, that, power, always, includes, resistance, which, means, there, is, always, a, possibility, that, power, and, force, relations, will, change, in, some, way, according, to, richard, a, lynch, the, purpose, of, foucault, s, work, on, power, is, to, increase, peoples, awareness, of, how, power, has, shaped, their, way, of, being, thinking, and, acting, and, by, increasing, this, awareness, making, it, possible, for, them, to, change, their, way, of, being, thinking, and, acting, with, sovereign, power, foucault, alludes, to, a, power, structure, that, is, similar, to, a, pyramid, where, one, person, or, a, group, of, people, at, the, top, of, the, pyramid, holds, the, power, while, the, normal, and, oppressed, people, are, at, the, bottom, of, the, pyramid, in, the, middle, parts, of, the, pyramid, are, the, people, who, enforce, the, sovereign, s, orders, a, typical, example, of, sovereign, power, is, absolute, monarchy, in, historical, absolute, monarchies, crimes, had, been, considered, a, personal, offense, against, the, sovereign, and, his, her, power, the, punishment, was, often, public, and, spectacular, partly, to, deter, others, from, committing, crimes, but, also, to, reinstate, the, sovereign, s, power, this, was, however, both, expensive, and, ineffective, it, led, far, too, often, to, people, sympathizing, with, the, criminal, in, modern, times, when, disciplinary, power, is, dominant, criminals, are, instead, subjected, to, various, disciplinary, techniques, to, remold, the, criminal, into, a, law, abiding, citizen, according, to, chlo, taylor, a, characteristic, for, sovereign, power, is, that, the, sovereign, has, the, right, to, take, life, wealth, services, labor, and, products, the, sovereign, has, a, right, to, subtract, to, take, life, to, enslave, life, etc, but, not, the, right, to, control, life, in, the, way, that, later, happens, in, disciplinary, systems, of, power, according, to, taylor, the, form, of, power, that, the, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, is, concerned, about, is, sovereign, power, according, to, hobbes, people, are, free, so, long, they, are, not, literally, placed, in, chains, what, foucault, calls, disciplinary, power, aims, to, use, bodies, skills, as, effectively, as, possible, the, more, useful, the, body, becomes, the, more, obedient, it, also, has, to, become, the, purpose, of, this, is, not, only, to, use, the, bodies, skills, but, also, prevent, these, skills, from, being, used, to, revolt, against, the, power, disciplinary, power, has, individuals, as, its, object, target, and, instrument, according, to, foucault, individual, is, however, a, construct, created, by, disciplinary, power, the, disciplinary, power, s, techniques, create, a, rational, self, control, which, in, practice, means, that, the, disciplinary, power, is, internalized, and, therefore, doesn, t, continuously, need, external, force, foucault, says, that, disciplinary, power, is, primarily, not, an, oppressing, form, of, power, but, rather, so, a, productive, form, of, power, disciplinary, power, doesn, t, oppress, interests, or, desires, but, instead, subjects, bodies, to, reconstructed, patterns, of, behavior, to, reconstruct, their, thoughts, desires, and, interests, according, to, foucault, this, happens, in, factories, schools, hospitals, and, prisons, disciplinary, power, creates, a, certain, type, of, individual, by, producing, new, movements, habits, and, skills, it, focuses, on, details, single, movements, their, timing, and, speed, it, organizes, bodies, in, time, and, space, and, controls, every, movement, for, maximal, effect, it, uses, rules, surveillance, exams, and, controls, the, activities, follow, certain, plans, whose, purpose, it, is, to, lead, the, bodies, to, certain, pre, determined, goals, the, bodies, are, also, combined, with, each, other, to, reach, a, productivity, that, is, greater, than, the, sum, of, all, bodies, activities, disciplinary, power, has, according, to, foucault, been, especially, successful, due, to, its, usage, of, three, technologies, hierarchical, observation, normalizing, judgement, and, exams, by, hierarchical, observation, the, bodies, become, constantly, visible, to, the, power, the, observation, is, hierarchical, since, there, is, not, a, single, observer, but, rather, so, a, hierarchy, of, observers, an, example, of, this, is, mental, asylums, during, the, 19th, century, when, the, psychiatrist, was, not, the, only, observer, but, also, nurses, and, auxiliary, staff, from, these, observations, and, scientific, discourses, a, norm, is, established, and, used, to, judge, the, observed, bodies, for, the, disciplinary, power, to, continue, to, exist, this, judgement, has, to, be, normalized, foucault, mentions, several, characteristics, of, this, judgement, 1, all, deviations, even, small, ones, from, correct, behavior, are, punished, 2, repeated, rule, violations, are, punished, extra, 3, exercises, are, used, as, a, behavior, correcting, technique, and, punishment, 4, rewards, are, used, together, with, punishment, to, establish, a, hierarchy, of, good, and, bad, behavior, people, 5, rank, grades, etc, are, used, as, punishment, and, reward, examinations, combine, the, hierarchical, observation, with, judgement, exams, objectify, and, individualize, the, observed, bodies, by, creating, extensive, documentation, about, every, observed, body, the, purpose, of, the, exams, is, therefore, to, gather, further, information, about, each, individual, track, their, development, and, compare, their, results, to, the, norm, according, to, foucault, the, formula, for, disciplinary, power, can, be, seen, in, philosopher, jeremy, bentham, s, plan, for, the, optimal, prison, the, panopticon, such, a, prison, consists, of, a, circle, formed, building, where, every, cell, is, inhabited, by, only, one, prisoner, in, every, cell, there, are, two, windows, one, to, let, in, light, from, outside, and, one, pointing, to, the, middle, of, the, circle, formed, building, in, this, middle, there, is, a, tower, where, a, guard, can, be, placed, to, observe, the, prisoners, since, the, prisoners, will, never, be, able, to, know, whether, they, are, being, watched, or, not, at, a, given, moment, they, will, internalize, the, disciplinary, power, and, regulate, their, own, behavior, as, if, they, were, constantly, being, watched, foucault, says, this, construction, 1, creates, an, individuality, by, separating, prisoners, from, each, other, in, the, physical, room, 2, since, the, prisoners, cannot, know, if, they, are, being, watched, at, any, given, moment, they, internalize, the, disciplinary, power, and, regulate, their, own, behavior, as, if, they, were, always, watched, 3, the, surveillance, makes, it, possible, to, create, extensive, documentation, about, each, prisoner, and, their, behavior, according, to, foucault, the, panopticon, has, been, used, as, a, model, also, for, other, disciplinary, institutions, such, as, mental, asylums, in, the, 19th, century, with, biopower, foucault, refers, to, power, over, bios, life, power, over, populations, biopower, primarily, rests, on, norms, which, are, internalized, by, people, rather, than, external, force, it, encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes, and, organize, the, forces, below, it, foucault, has, sometimes, described, biopower, as, separate, from, disciplinary, power, but, at, other, times, he, has, described, disciplinary, power, as, an, expression, of, biopower, biopower, can, use, disciplinary, techniques, but, in, contrast, to, disciplinary, power, its, target, is, populations, rather, than, individuals, biopower, studies, populations, regarding, for, example, number, of, births, life, expectancy, public, health, housing, migration, crime, which, social, groups, are, over, represented, in, deviations, from, the, norm, regarding, health, crime, etc, and, tries, to, adjust, control, or, eliminate, these, norm, deviations, one, example, is, the, age, distribution, in, a, population, biopower, is, interested, in, age, distribution, to, compensate, for, future, or, current, lacks, of, labor, power, retirement, homes, etc, yet, another, example, is, sex, because, sex, is, connected, to, population, growth, sex, and, sexuality, have, been, of, great, interest, to, biopower, on, a, disciplinary, level, people, who, engaged, in, non, reproductive, sexual, acts, have, been, treated, for, psychiatric, diagnoses, such, as, perversion, frigidity, and, sexual, dysfunction, on, a, biopower, level, the, usage, of, contraceptives, has, been, studied, some, social, groups, have, by, various, means, been, encouraged, to, have, children, while, others, such, as, poor, sick, unmarried, women, criminals, or, people, with, disabilities, have, been, discouraged, or, prevented, from, having, children, in, the, era, of, biopower, death, has, become, a, scandal, and, a, catastrophe, but, despite, this, biopower, has, according, to, foucault, killed, more, people, than, any, other, form, of, power, has, ever, done, before, it, under, sovereign, power, the, sovereign, king, could, kill, people, to, exert, his, power, or, start, wars, simply, to, extend, his, kingdom, but, during, the, era, of, biopower, wars, have, instead, been, motivated, by, an, ambition, to, protect, life, itself, similar, motivations, has, also, been, used, for, genocide, for, example, nazi, germany, motivated, its, attempt, to, eradicate, jews, the, mentally, ill, and, disabled, with, the, motivation, that, jews, were, a, threat, to, the, german, health, and, that, the, money, spent, on, healthcare, for, mentally, ill, and, disabled, people, would, be, better, spent, on, viable, germans, chlo, taylor, also, mentions, the, iraq, war, was, motivated, by, similar, tenets, the, motivation, was, at, first, that, iraq, was, thought, to, have, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, connections, to, al, qaeda, however, when, the, bush, and, blair, administrations, did, not, find, any, evidence, to, support, either, of, these, theories, the, motivation, for, the, war, was, changed, in, the, new, motivation, the, cause, of, the, war, was, said, to, be, that, saddam, hussein, had, committed, crimes, against, his, own, population, taylor, means, that, in, modern, times, war, has, to, be, concealed, under, a, rhetoric, of, humanitarian, aid, despite, the, fact, that, these, wars, often, cause, humanitarian, crises, during, the, 19th, century, slums, were, increasing, in, number, and, size, across, the, western, world, criminality, illness, alcoholism, and, prostitution, was, common, in, these, areas, and, the, middle, class, considered, the, people, who, lived, in, these, slums, as, unmoral, and, lazy, the, middle, class, also, feared, that, this, underclass, sooner, or, later, would, take, over, because, the, population, growth, was, greater, in, these, slums, than, it, was, in, the, middle, class, this, fear, gave, rise, to, the, scientific, study, of, eugenics, whose, founder, francis, galton, had, been, inspired, by, charles, darwin, and, his, theory, of, natural, selection, according, to, galton, society, was, preventing, natural, selection, by, helping, the, weak, thus, causing, a, spread, of, the, negative, qualities, into, the, rest, of, the, population, according, to, foucault, the, body, is, not, something, objective, that, stands, outside, history, and, culture, instead, foucault, argues, the, body, has, been, and, is, continuously, shaped, by, society, and, history, by, work, diet, body, ideals, exercise, medical, interventions, etc, foucault, presents, no, theory, of, the, body, but, does, write, about, it, in, discipline, and, punish, as, well, as, in, the, history, of, sexuality, foucault, was, critical, of, all, purely, biological, explanations, of, phenomena, such, as, sexuality, madness, and, criminality, further, foucault, argues, that, the, body, is, not, sufficient, as, a, basis, for, self, understanding, and, understanding, of, others, in, discipline, and, punish, foucault, shows, how, power, and, the, body, are, tied, together, for, example, by, the, disciplinary, power, primarily, focusing, on, individual, bodies, and, their, behavior, foucault, argues, that, power, by, manipulating, bodies, behavior, also, manipulates, people, s, minds, foucault, turns, the, platonic, saying, the, body, is, the, prison, of, the, soul, phaedo, 66a, 67d, and, instead, posits, that, the, soul, is, the, prison, of, the, body, according, to, foucault, sexology, has, tried, to, exert, itself, as, a, science, by, referring, to, the, material, the, body, in, contrast, to, this, foucault, argues, that, sexology, is, a, pseudoscience, and, that, sex, is, a, pseudo, scientific, idea, for, foucault, the, idea, of, a, natural, biologically, grounded, and, fundamental, sexuality, is, a, normative, historical, construct, that, has, also, been, used, as, an, instrument, of, power, by, describing, sex, as, the, biological, and, fundamental, cause, to, peoples, gender, identity, sexual, identity, and, sexual, behavior, power, has, effectively, been, able, to, normalize, sexual, and, gendered, behavior, this, has, made, it, possible, to, evaluate, pathologize, and, correct, peoples, sexual, and, gendered, behavior, by, comparing, bodies, behaviors, to, the, constructed, normal, behavior, for, foucault, a, normal, sexuality, is, as, much, of, a, construct, as, a, natural, sexuality, therefore, foucault, was, also, critical, of, the, popular, discourse, that, dominated, the, debate, over, sexuality, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, during, this, time, the, popular, discourse, argued, for, a, liberation, of, sexuality, from, a, cultural, moral, and, capitalistic, oppression, foucault, however, argues, that, peoples, opinions, about, and, experiences, of, sexuality, are, always, a, result, of, cultural, and, power, mechanisms, to, liberate, sexuality, from, one, group, of, norms, only, means, that, another, group, of, norms, takes, its, place, this, however, does, not, mean, that, foucault, considers, resistance, to, be, futile, what, foucault, argues, for, is, rather, that, it, is, impossible, to, become, completely, free, from, power, and, that, there, is, simply, no, natural, sexuality, power, always, involves, a, dimension, of, resistance, and, therefore, also, a, possibility, for, change, although, foucault, considers, it, impossible, to, step, outside, of, power, networks, it, is, always, possible, to, change, these, networks, or, navigate, them, differently, according, to, foucault, the, body, is, not, only, an, obedient, and, passive, object, that, is, dominated, by, discourses, and, power, the, body, is, also, the, seed, to, resistance, against, dominant, discourses, and, power, techniques, the, body, is, never, fully, compliant, and, experiences, can, never, fully, be, reduced, to, linguistic, descriptions, there, is, always, a, possibility, to, experience, something, that, is, not, possible, to, describe, with, words, and, in, this, discrepancy, there, is, also, a, possibility, for, resistance, against, dominant, discourses, foucault, s, view, of, the, historical, construction, of, the, body, has, influenced, many, feminist, and, queer, theorists, according, to, johanna, oksala, foucault, s, influence, on, queer, theory, has, been, so, great, than, he, can, be, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, queer, theory, the, fundamental, idea, behind, queer, theory, is, that, there, is, no, natural, fundament, that, lies, behind, identities, such, as, gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc, instead, these, identities, are, considered, cultural, constructions, that, have, been, constructed, through, normative, discourses, and, relations, of, power, feminists, have, with, the, help, of, foucault, s, ideas, studied, different, ways, that, women, form, their, bodies, through, plastic, surgery, diet, eating, disorders, etc, foucault, s, historization, of, sex, has, also, affected, feminist, theorists, such, as, judith, butler, who, used, foucault, s, theories, about, the, relation, between, subject, power, and, sex, to, question, gendered, subjects, butler, follows, foucault, by, saying, that, there, is, no, true, gender, behind, gender, identity, that, constitutes, its, biological, and, objective, fundament, however, butler, is, critical, of, foucault, arguing, that, foucault, naively, presents, bodies, and, pleasures, as, a, ground, for, resistance, against, power, without, extending, his, historization, of, sexuality, to, gendered, subjects, bodies, foucault, has, received, criticism, from, other, feminists, such, as, susan, bordo, and, kate, soper, johanna, oksala, argues, that, foucault, by, saying, that, sex, sexuality, are, constructed, doesn, t, deny, the, existence, of, sexuality, oksala, also, argues, that, the, goal, of, critical, theories, such, as, foucault, s, is, not, to, liberate, the, body, and, sexuality, from, oppression, but, rather, to, question, and, deny, the, identities, that, are, posited, as, natural, and, essential, by, showing, how, these, identities, are, historical, and, cultural, constructions, in, may, 1977, foucault, signed, a, petition, to, the, french, parliament, calling, for, the, lowering, of, the, homosexual, age, of, consent, from, 21, to, 15, to, match, with, the, heterosexual, one, in, a, 1978, broadcast, foucault, argued, that, children, could, give, sexual, consent, saying, that, to, assume, that, a, child, is, incapable, of, explaining, what, happened, and, was, incapable, of, giving, his, consent, are, two, abuses, that, are, intolerable, quite, unacceptable, foucault, considered, his, primary, project, to, be, the, investigation, of, how, people, through, history, have, been, made, into, subjects, subjectivity, for, foucault, is, not, a, state, of, being, but, a, practice, an, active, being, according, to, foucault, the, subject, has, by, western, philosophers, usually, been, considered, as, something, given, natural, and, objective, on, the, contrary, foucault, considers, subjectivity, to, be, a, construction, created, by, power, foucault, talks, of, assujettissement, which, is, a, french, term, that, for, foucault, refers, to, a, process, where, power, creates, subjects, while, also, oppressing, them, using, social, norms, for, foucault, social, norms, are, standards, that, people, are, encouraged, to, follow, that, are, also, used, to, compare, and, define, people, as, an, example, of, assujettissement, foucault, mentions, homosexual, a, historically, contingent, type, of, subjectivity, that, was, created, by, sexology, foucault, writes, that, sodomy, was, previously, considered, a, serious, sexual, deviation, but, a, temporary, one, homosexuality, however, became, a, species, a, past, a, childhood, and, a, type, of, life, homosexuals, have, by, the, same, power, that, created, this, subjectivity, been, discriminated, against, due, to, homosexuality, being, considered, as, a, deviation, from, the, normal, sexuality, however, foucault, argues, the, creation, of, a, subjectivity, such, as, homosexuality, does, not, only, have, negative, consequences, for, the, people, who, are, subjectivised, subjectivity, of, homosexuality, has, also, led, to, the, creation, of, gay, bars, and, the, pride, parade, according, to, foucault, scientific, discourses, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, disciplinary, power, system, by, classifying, and, categorizing, people, observing, their, behavior, and, treating, them, when, their, behavior, has, been, considered, abnormal, he, defines, discourse, as, a, form, of, oppression, that, does, not, require, physical, force, he, identifies, its, production, as, controlled, selected, organized, and, redistributed, by, a, certain, number, of, procedures, which, are, driven, by, individuals, aspiration, of, knowledge, to, create, rules, and, systems, that, translate, into, social, codes, moreover, discourse, creates, a, force, that, extends, beyond, societal, institutions, and, could, be, found, in, social, and, formal, fields, such, as, health, care, systems, education, and, law, enforcement, the, formation, of, these, fields, may, seem, to, contribute, to, social, development, however, foucault, warns, against, discourses, harmful, aspects, on, society, sciences, such, as, psychiatry, biology, medicine, economics, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy, and, criminology, have, all, categorized, behaviors, as, rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc, by, doing, so, they, have, all, created, various, types, of, subjectivity, and, norms, which, are, then, internalized, by, people, as, truths, people, have, then, adapted, their, behavior, to, get, closer, to, what, these, sciences, has, labeled, as, normal, for, example, foucault, claims, that, psychological, observation, surveillance, and, psychological, discourses, have, created, a, type, of, psychology, centered, subjectivity, which, has, led, to, people, considering, unhappiness, a, fault, in, their, psychology, rather, than, in, society, this, has, also, according, to, foucault, been, a, way, for, society, to, resist, criticism, criticism, against, society, has, been, turned, against, the, individual, and, their, psychological, health, according, to, foucault, subjectivity, is, not, necessarily, something, that, is, forced, upon, people, externally, it, is, also, something, that, is, established, in, a, person, s, relation, to, themselves, this, can, for, example, happen, when, a, person, is, trying, to, find, themselves, or, be, themselves, something, edward, mcgushin, describes, as, a, typical, modern, activity, in, this, quest, for, the, true, self, the, self, is, established, in, two, levels, as, a, passive, object, the, true, self, that, is, searched, for, and, as, an, active, searcher, the, ancient, cynics, and, the, 19th, century, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, posited, that, the, true, self, can, only, be, found, by, going, through, great, hardship, and, or, danger, the, ancient, stoics, and, 17th, century, philosopher, ren, descartes, however, argued, that, the, self, can, be, found, by, quiet, and, solitary, introspection, yet, another, example, is, socrates, who, argued, that, self, awareness, can, only, be, found, by, having, debates, with, others, where, the, debaters, question, each, other, s, foundational, views, and, opinions, foucault, however, argued, that, subjectivity, is, a, process, rather, than, a, state, of, being, as, such, foucault, argued, that, there, is, no, true, self, to, be, found, rather, so, the, self, is, constituted, created, in, activities, such, as, the, ones, employed, to, find, the, self, in, other, words, exposing, oneself, to, hardships, and, danger, does, not, reveal, the, true, self, according, to, foucault, but, rather, creates, a, particular, type, of, self, and, subjectivity, however, according, to, foucault, the, form, for, the, subject, is, in, great, part, already, constituted, by, power, before, these, self, constituting, practices, are, employed, schools, workplaces, households, government, institutions, entertainment, media, and, the, healthcare, sector, all, through, disciplinary, power, contribute, to, forming, people, into, being, particular, types, of, subjects, todd, may, defines, foucault, s, concept, of, freedom, as, that, which, we, can, do, of, ourselves, within, our, specific, historical, context, a, condition, for, this, according, to, foucault, is, that, we, are, aware, of, our, situation, and, how, it, has, been, created, affected, and, is, still, being, affected, by, power, according, to, may, two, of, the, aspects, of, how, power, has, shaped, peoples, way, of, being, thinking, and, acting, are, described, in, the, books, where, foucault, deals, with, disciplinary, power, and, the, history, of, sexuality, however, may, argues, there, will, always, be, aspects, of, peoples, formation, that, will, be, unknown, to, them, hence, the, constant, necessity, for, the, type, of, analyses, that, foucault, did, foucault, argues, that, the, forces, that, have, affected, people, can, be, changed, people, always, have, the, capacity, to, change, the, factors, that, limit, their, freedom, freedom, is, thus, not, a, state, of, being, but, a, practice, a, way, of, being, in, relation, to, oneself, to, others, and, to, the, world, according, to, todd, may, foucault, s, concept, of, freedom, also, includes, constructing, histories, like, the, ones, foucault, did, about, the, history, of, disciplinary, power, and, sexuality, histories, that, investigate, and, describe, the, forces, that, have, influenced, people, into, becoming, who, they, are, from, the, knowledge, that, is, reached, through, such, investigations, people, can, thereafter, decide, which, forces, they, believe, are, acceptable, and, which, they, consider, to, be, intolerable, and, has, to, be, changed, freedom, is, for, foucault, a, type, of, experimentation, with, different, transformations, since, these, experiments, cannot, be, controlled, completely, may, argues, they, may, either, lead, to, the, reconstruction, of, intolerable, power, relations, or, the, creation, of, new, ones, thus, may, argues, it, is, always, necessary, to, continue, with, such, experimentation, and, foucauldian, analyses, foucault, s, alternative, to, the, modern, subjectivity, is, described, by, cressida, heyes, as, critique, for, foucault, there, are, no, good, and, bad, forms, of, subjectivity, since, they, are, all, a, result, of, power, relations, in, the, same, way, foucault, argues, there, are, no, good, and, bad, norms, all, norms, and, institutions, are, at, the, same, time, enabling, as, they, are, oppressing, therefore, foucault, argues, it, is, always, crucial, to, continue, with, the, practice, of, critique, critique, is, for, foucault, a, practice, that, searches, for, the, processes, and, events, that, led, to, our, way, of, being, a, questioning, of, who, we, are, and, how, this, we, came, to, be, such, a, critical, ontology, of, the, present, shows, that, peoples, current, being, is, in, fact, a, historically, contingent, unstable, and, changeable, construction, foucault, emphasizes, that, since, the, current, way, of, being, is, not, a, necessity, it, is, also, possible, to, change, it, critique, also, includes, investigating, how, and, when, people, are, being, enabled, and, when, they, are, being, oppressed, by, the, current, norms, and, institutions, finding, ways, to, reduce, limitations, on, freedom, resist, normalization, and, develop, new, and, different, way, of, relating, to, oneself, and, others, foucault, argues, that, it, is, impossible, to, go, beyond, power, relations, but, that, it, is, always, possible, to, navigate, power, relations, in, a, different, way, as, an, alternative, to, the, modern, search, for, the, true, self, and, as, a, part, of, the, work, of, freedom, foucault, discusses, the, antique, greek, term, epimeleia, heautou, care, for, the, self, according, to, foucault, among, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, self, awareness, was, not, a, goal, in, itself, but, rather, something, that, was, sought, after, in, order, to, care, for, oneself, care, for, the, self, consists, of, what, foucault, calls, the, art, of, living, or, technologies, of, the, self, the, goal, of, these, techniques, was, according, to, foucault, to, transform, oneself, into, a, more, ethical, person, as, an, example, of, this, foucault, mentions, meditation, the, stoic, activity, of, contemplating, past, and, future, actions, and, evaluating, if, these, actions, are, in, line, with, one, s, values, and, goals, and, contemplation, of, nature, contemplation, of, nature, is, another, stoic, activity, that, consists, of, reflecting, on, how, small, one, s, existence, is, when, compared, to, the, greater, cosmos, foucault, is, described, by, mary, beth, mader, as, an, epistemological, constructivist, and, historicist, foucault, is, critical, of, the, idea, that, humans, can, reach, absolute, knowledge, about, the, world, a, fundamental, goal, in, many, of, foucault, s, works, is, to, show, how, that, which, has, traditionally, been, considered, as, absolute, universal, and, true, in, fact, are, historically, contingent, to, foucault, even, the, idea, of, absolute, knowledge, is, a, historically, contingent, idea, this, does, however, not, lead, to, epistemological, nihilism, rather, foucault, argues, that, we, always, begin, anew, when, it, comes, to, knowledge, at, the, same, time, foucault, is, critical, of, modern, western, philosophy, for, lacking, spirituality, with, spirituality, foucault, refers, to, a, certain, type, of, ethical, being, and, the, processes, that, lead, to, this, state, of, being, foucault, argues, that, such, a, spirituality, was, a, natural, part, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophy, where, knowledge, was, considered, as, something, that, was, only, accessible, to, those, that, had, an, ethical, character, according, to, foucault, this, changed, in, the, cartesian, moment, the, moment, when, ren, descartes, reached, the, insight, that, self, awareness, was, something, given, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, and, from, this, insight, descartes, drew, conclusions, about, god, the, world, and, knowledge, according, to, foucault, since, descartes, knowledge, has, been, something, separate, from, ethics, in, modern, times, foucault, argues, anyone, can, reach, knowledge, as, long, as, they, are, rational, beings, educated, willing, to, participate, in, the, scientific, community, and, use, a, scientific, method, foucault, is, critical, of, this, modern, view, of, knowledge, foucault, describes, two, types, of, knowledge, savoir, and, connaissance, two, french, terms, that, both, can, be, translated, as, knowledge, but, with, separate, meanings, for, foucault, by, savoir, foucault, is, referring, to, a, process, where, subjects, are, created, while, at, the, same, time, these, subjects, also, become, objects, for, knowledge, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, in, criminology, and, psychiatry, in, these, sciences, subjects, such, as, the, rational, person, the, mentally, ill, person, the, law, abiding, person, the, criminal, etc, are, created, and, these, sciences, center, their, attention, and, knowledge, on, these, subjects, the, knowledge, about, these, subjects, is, connaissance, while, the, process, in, which, subjects, and, knowledge, are, created, is, savoir, a, similar, term, in, foucaults, corpus, is, pouvoir, savoir, power, knowledge, with, this, term, foucault, is, referring, to, a, type, of, knowledge, that, is, considered, common, sense, but, that, is, created, and, withheld, in, that, position, as, common, sense, by, power, the, term, power, knowledge, comes, from, jeremy, bentham, s, idea, that, panopticons, wouldn, t, only, be, prisons, but, would, be, used, for, experiments, where, the, criminals, behaviour, would, be, studied, power, knowledge, thus, refers, to, forms, of, power, where, the, power, compares, individuals, measures, differences, establishes, a, norm, and, then, forces, this, norm, unto, the, subjects, this, is, especially, successful, when, the, established, norm, is, internalized, and, institutionalized, by, institutionalized, foucault, refers, to, when, the, norm, is, omnipresent, because, then, when, the, norm, is, internalized, and, institutionalized, it, has, effectively, become, a, part, of, peoples, common, sense, the, obvious, the, given, the, natural, when, this, has, happened, this, common, sense, also, affects, the, explicit, knowledge, scientific, knowledge, foucault, argues, ellen, k, feder, states, that, the, premise, the, world, consists, of, women, and, men, is, an, example, of, this, this, premise, feder, argues, has, been, considered, common, sense, and, has, led, to, the, creation, of, the, psychiatric, diagnosis, gender, identity, disorder, gid, for, example, during, the, 1970s, children, with, behavior, that, was, not, considered, appropriate, for, their, gender, was, diagnosed, with, gid, the, treatment, then, consisted, of, trying, to, make, the, child, adapt, to, the, prevailing, gender, norms, feder, argues, that, this, is, an, example, of, power, knowledge, since, psychiatry, from, the, common, sense, premise, the, world, consists, of, women, and, men, a, premise, which, is, upheld, in, this, status, by, power, created, a, new, diagnosis, a, new, type, of, subject, and, a, whole, body, of, knowledge, surrounding, this, new, subject, foucault, s, works, have, exercised, a, powerful, influence, over, numerous, humanistic, and, social, scientific, disciplines, as, one, of, the, most, influential, and, controversial, scholars, of, the, post, world, war, ii, period, according, to, a, london, school, of, economics, analysis, in, 2016, his, works, discipline, and, punish, and, the, history, of, sexuality, were, among, the, 25, most, cited, books, in, the, social, sciences, of, all, time, at, just, over, 100, 000, citations, in, 2007, foucault, was, listed, as, the, single, most, cited, scholar, in, the, humanities, by, the, isi, web, of, science, among, a, large, quantity, of, french, philosophers, the, compilation, s, author, commenting, that, what, this, says, of, modern, scholarship, is, for, the, reader, to, decide, and, it, is, imagined, that, judgments, will, vary, from, admiration, to, despair, depending, on, one, s, view, according, to, gary, gutting, foucault, s, detailed, historical, remarks, on, the, emergence, of, disciplinary, and, regulatory, biopower, have, been, widely, influential, leo, bersani, wrote, that, is, our, most, brilliant, philosopher, of, power, more, originally, than, any, other, contemporary, thinker, he, has, attempted, to, define, the, historical, constraints, under, which, we, live, at, the, same, time, that, he, has, been, anxious, to, account, for, if, possible, even, to, locate, the, points, at, which, we, might, resist, those, constraints, and, counter, some, of, the, moves, of, power, in, the, present, climate, of, cynical, disgust, with, the, exercise, of, political, power, foucault, s, importance, can, hardly, be, exaggerated, foucault, s, work, on, biopower, has, been, widely, influential, within, the, disciplines, of, philosophy, and, political, theory, particularly, for, such, authors, as, giorgio, agamben, roberto, esposito, antonio, negri, and, michael, hardt, his, discussions, on, power, and, discourse, have, inspired, many, critical, theorists, who, believe, that, foucault, s, analysis, of, power, structures, could, aid, the, struggle, against, inequality, they, claim, that, through, discourse, analysis, hierarchies, may, be, uncovered, and, questioned, by, way, of, analyzing, the, corresponding, fields, of, knowledge, through, which, they, are, legitimated, this, is, one, of, the, ways, that, foucault, s, work, is, linked, to, critical, theory, his, work, discipline, and, punish, influenced, his, friend, and, contemporary, gilles, deleuze, who, published, the, paper, postscript, on, the, societies, of, control, praising, foucault, s, work, but, arguing, that, contemporary, western, society, has, in, fact, developed, from, a, disciplinary, society, into, a, society, of, control, deleuze, went, on, to, publish, a, book, dedicated, to, foucault, s, thought, in, 1988, under, the, title, foucault, foucault, s, discussions, of, the, relationship, between, power, and, knowledge, has, influenced, postcolonial, critiques, in, explaining, the, discursive, formation, of, colonialism, particularly, in, edward, said, s, work, orientalism, foucault, s, work, has, been, compared, to, that, of, erving, goffman, by, the, sociologist, michael, hviid, jacobsen, and, soren, kristiansen, who, list, goffman, as, an, influence, on, foucault, foucault, s, writings, particularly, the, history, of, sexuality, have, also, been, very, influential, in, feminist, philosophy, and, queer, theory, particularly, the, work, of, the, major, feminist, scholar, judith, butler, due, to, his, theories, regarding, the, genealogy, of, maleness, and, femaleness, power, sexuality, and, bodies, douglas, murray, writing, in, his, book, the, war, on, the, west, argued, that, foucault, s, obsessive, analysis, of, everything, through, a, quasi, marxist, lens, of, power, relations, diminished, almost, everything, in, society, into, a, transactional, punitive, and, meaningless, dystopia, a, prominent, critique, of, foucault, s, thought, concerns, his, refusal, to, propose, positive, solutions, to, the, social, and, political, issues, that, he, critiques, since, no, human, relation, is, devoid, of, power, freedom, becomes, elusive, even, as, an, ideal, this, stance, which, critiques, normativity, as, socially, constructed, and, contingent, but, which, relies, on, an, implicit, norm, to, mount, the, critique, led, philosopher, j, rgen, habermas, to, describe, foucault, s, thinking, as, crypto, normativist, covertly, reliant, on, the, very, enlightenment, principles, he, attempts, to, argue, against, a, similar, critique, has, been, advanced, by, diana, taylor, and, by, nancy, fraser, who, argues, that, foucault, s, critique, encompasses, traditional, moral, systems, he, denies, himself, by, recourse, to, concepts, such, as, freedom, and, justice, and, therefore, lacks, the, ability, to, generate, positive, alternatives, the, philosopher, richard, rorty, has, argued, that, foucault, s, archaeology, of, knowledge, is, fundamentally, negative, and, thus, fails, to, adequately, establish, any, new, theory, of, knowledge, per, se, rather, foucault, simply, provides, a, few, valuable, maxims, regarding, the, reading, of, history, rorty, writes, as, far, as, i, can, see, all, he, has, to, offer, are, brilliant, redescriptions, of, the, past, supplemented, by, helpful, hints, on, how, to, avoid, being, trapped, by, old, historiographical, assumptions, these, hints, consist, largely, of, saying, do, not, look, for, progress, or, meaning, in, history, do, not, see, the, history, of, a, given, activity, of, any, segment, of, culture, as, the, development, of, rationality, or, of, freedom, do, not, use, any, philosophical, vocabulary, to, characterize, the, essence, of, such, activity, or, the, goal, it, serves, do, not, assume, that, the, way, this, activity, is, presently, conducted, gives, any, clue, to, the, goals, it, served, in, the, past, foucault, has, frequently, been, criticized, by, historians, for, what, they, consider, to, be, a, lack, of, rigor, in, his, analyses, for, example, hans, ulrich, wehler, harshly, criticized, foucault, in, 1998, although, wehler, recognizes, that, foucault, has, highlighted, some, problems, of, modernity, that, until, then, had, been, removed, or, completely, ignored, he, regards, the, latter, as, a, bad, philosopher, who, wrongfully, received, a, good, response, by, the, humanities, and, by, social, sciences, according, to, wehler, foucault, s, works, are, not, only, insufficient, in, their, empirical, historical, aspects, but, also, often, contradictory, and, lacking, in, clarity, for, example, foucault, s, concept, of, power, is, desperatingly, undifferentiated, and, foucault, s, thesis, of, a, disciplinary, society, is, according, to, wehler, only, possible, because, foucault, does, not, properly, differentiate, between, authority, force, power, violence, and, legitimacy, in, addition, his, thesis, is, based, on, a, one, sided, choice, of, sources, prisons, and, psychiatric, institutions, and, neglects, other, types, of, organizations, such, as, factories, also, wehler, criticizes, foucault, s, francocentrism, because, he, did, not, take, into, consideration, major, german, speaking, theorists, of, social, sciences, like, max, weber, and, norbert, elias, in, all, wehler, concludes, that, foucault, is, because, of, the, endless, series, of, flaws, in, his, so, called, empirical, studies, an, intellectually, dishonest, intellektuell, unredlicher, empirically, absolutely, unreliable, empirisch, absolut, unzuverlaessiger, crypto, normativist, seducer, rattenfaenger, of, postmodernism, though, american, feminists, have, built, on, foucault, s, critiques, of, the, historical, construction, of, gender, roles, and, sexuality, some, feminists, note, the, limitations, of, the, masculinist, subjectivity, and, ethical, orientation, that, he, describes, a, related, issue, raised, by, scholars, elizabeth, povinelli, and, kathryn, yusoff, is, the, almost, complete, absence, of, any, discussion, of, race, in, his, writings, yusoff, 2018, p, 211, says, povinelli, draws, our, attention, to, the, provinciality, of, foucault, s, project, in, its, conceptualization, of, a, western, european, genealogy, the, philosopher, roger, scruton, argues, in, sexual, desire, 1986, that, foucault, was, incorrect, to, claim, in, the, history, of, sexuality, that, sexual, morality, is, culturally, relative, he, criticizes, foucault, for, assuming, that, there, could, be, societies, in, which, a, problematisation, of, the, sexual, did, not, occur, concluding, that, no, history, of, thought, could, show, the, problematisation, of, sexual, experience, to, be, peculiar, to, certain, specific, social, formations, it, is, characteristic, of, personal, experience, generally, and, therefore, of, every, genuine, social, order, foucault, s, approach, to, sexuality, which, he, sees, as, socially, constructed, has, become, influential, in, queer, theory, foucault, s, resistance, to, identity, politics, and, his, rejection, of, the, psychoanalytic, concept, of, object, choice, stand, at, odds, with, some, theories, of, queer, identity, foucault, is, sometimes, criticized, for, his, purported, social, constructionism, which, some, see, as, an, affront, to, the, concept, of, truth, in, foucault, s, 1971, televised, debate, with, noam, chomsky, foucault, argued, against, the, possibility, of, any, fixed, human, nature, as, posited, by, chomsky, s, concept, of, innate, human, faculties, chomsky, argued, that, concepts, of, justice, were, rooted, in, human, reason, whereas, foucault, rejected, the, universal, basis, for, a, concept, of, justice, following, the, debate, chomsky, was, stricken, with, foucault, s, total, rejection, of, the, possibility, of, a, universal, morality, stating, he, struck, me, as, completely, amoral, i, d, never, met, anyone, who, was, so, totally, amoral, i, mean, i, liked, him, personally, it, s, just, that, i, couldn, t, make, sense, of, him, it, s, as, if, he, was, from, a, different, species, or, something, peruvian, writer, mario, vargas, llosa, while, acknowledging, that, foucault, contributed, to, give, a, right, of, citizenship, in, cultural, life, to, certain, marginal, and, eccentric, experiences, of, sexuality, of, cultural, repression, of, madness, asserts, that, his, radical, critique, of, authority, was, detrimental, to, education, one, of, foucault, s, claims, regarding, the, subjectivity, of, the, self, has, been, disputed, opposing, foucault, s, view, of, subjectivity, terje, sparby, friedrich, edelh, user, and, ulrich, w, weger, argue, that, other, factors, such, as, biological, environmental, and, cultural, are, explanations, for, the, self, jean, baudrillard, in, his, 1977, tract, oublier, foucault, trans, forget, foucault, asserted, that, foucault, s, discourse, is, a, mirror, of, the, powers, it, describes, 30, since, it, is, possible, at, last, to, talk, with, such, definitive, understanding, about, power, sexuality, the, body, and, discipline, it, is, because, at, some, point, all, this, is, here, and, now, over, with, therefore, with, the, coincidence, between, this, new, version, of, power, and, the, new, version, of, desire, proposed, by, deleuze, and, lyotard, not, accidental, it, s, simply, that, in, foucault, power, takes, the, place, of, desire, that, is, why, there, is, no, desire, in, foucault, its, place, is, already, taken, when, power, blends, into, desire, and, desire, blends, into, power, let, s, forget, them, both
