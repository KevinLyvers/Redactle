rightly, guided, caliphs, to, distinguish, them, from, mu, awiya, and, his, umayyad, dynastic, successors, having, to, contend, with, challenges, to, his, leadership, from, the, ansar, the, natives, of, medina, who, had, provided, muhammad, safe, haven, from, his, erstwhile, meccan, opponents, and, the, mass, defections, of, several, arab, tribes, abu, bakr, reached, out, to, the, quraysh, particularly, its, two, strongest, clans, the, banu, makhzum, and, banu, abd, shams, to, shore, up, support, for, the, caliphate, among, those, qurayshites, whom, he, appointed, to, suppress, the,

ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, as, the, general, commander, of, the, muslim, army, in, syria, in, 636, after, the, rout, of, the, byzantines, at, the, battle, of, yarmouk, which, paved, the, way, for, the, conquest, of, the, rest, of, syria, mu, awiya, was, among, the, arab, troops, that, entered, jerusalem, with, caliph, umar, in, 637, afterward, mu, awiya, and, yazid, were, dispatched, by, abu,

led, a, campaign, against, cilicia, and, proceeded, to, euchaita, deep, in, byzantine, anatolia, in, 644, he, led, a, foray, against, the, anatolian, city, of, amorium, the, successive, promotions, of, abu, sufyan, s, sons, contradicted, umar, s, efforts, to, otherwise, curtail, the, influence, of, the, qurayshite, aristocracy, in, the, muslim, state, in, favor, of, the, earliest, muslim, converts, i, e, the, muhajirun, and, ansar, groups, according, to, the, historian, leone, caetani, this, exceptional, treatment, stemmed, from, umar, s, personal, respect, for, the, umayyads, the, branch, of, the, banu, abd, shams, to, which, mu, awiya, belonged, this, is, doubted, by, the, historian, wilferd, madelung, who, surmises, that, umar, had, little, choice, due, to, the, lack, of, a, suitable, alternative, to, mu, awiya, in, syria, and, the, ongoing, plague, in, the, region, which, precluded, the, deployment, of, commanders, more, preferable, to, umar, from, medina, upon, the, accession, of, caliph, uthman, r, 644, 656, mu, awiya, s, governorship, was, enlarged, to, include, palestine, while, a, companion, of, muhammad, umayr, ibn, sa, d, al, ansari, was, confirmed, as, governor, of, the, homs, jazira, district, in, late, 646, or, early, 647, uthman, attached, the, homs, jazira, district, to, mu, awiya, s, syrian, governorship, greatly, increasing, the, military, manpower, at, his, disposal, during, the, reign, of, uthman, mu, awiya, allied, with, the, banu, kalb, the, predominant, tribe, in, the, syrian, steppe, extending, from, the, oasis, of, dumat, al, jandal, in, the, south, to, the, approaches, of, palmyra, and, the, chief, component, of, the, quda, a, confederation, present, throughout, syria, medina, consistently, courted, the, kalb, which, had, remained, mostly, neutral, during, the, arab, byzantine, wars, particularly, after, the, central, government, s, entreaties, to, the, byzantines, principal, arab, allies, the, christian, ghassanids, were, rebuffed, before, the, advent, of, islam, in, syria, the, kalb, and, the, quda, a, long, under, the, influence, of, greco, aramaic, culture, and, the, monophysite, church, had, served, byzantium, as, subordinates, of, its, ghassanid, client, kings, to, guard, the, syrian, frontier, against, invasions, by, the, sasanian, persians, and, the, latter, s, arab, clients, the, lakhmids, by, the, time, the, muslims, entered, syria, the, kalb, and, the, quda, a, had, accumulated, significant, military, experience, and, were, accustomed, to, hierarchical, order, and, military, obedience, to, harness, their, strength, and, thereby, secure, his, foothold, in, syria, mu, awiya, consolidated, ties, to, the, kalb, s, ruling, house, the, clan, of, bahdal, ibn, unayf, by, wedding, the, latter, s, daughter, maysun, in, c, 650, he, also, married, maysun, s, paternal, cousin, na, ila, bint, umara, for, a, short, period, mu, awiya, s, reliance, on, the, native, syrian, arab, tribes, was, compounded, by, the, heavy, toll, inflicted, on, the, muslim, troops, in, syria, by, the, plague, of, amwas, which, caused, troop, numbers, to, dwindle, from, 24, 000, in, 637, to, 4, 000, in, 639, moreover, the, focus, of, arabian, tribal, migration, was, toward, the, sasanian, front, in, iraq, mu, awiya, oversaw, a, liberal, recruitment, policy, that, resulted, in, considerable, numbers, of, christian, tribesmen, and, frontier, peasants, filling, the, ranks, of, his, regular, and, auxiliary, forces, indeed, the, christian, tanukhids, and, the, mixed, muslim, christian, banu, tayy, formed, part, of, mu, awiya, s, army, in, northern, syria, to, help, pay, for, his, troops, mu, awiya, requested, and, was, granted, ownership, by, uthman, of, the, abundant, income, producing, byzantine, crown, lands, in, syria, which, were, previously, designated, by, umar, as, communal, property, for, the, muslim, army, although, syria, s, rural, aramaic, speaking, christian, population, remained, largely, intact, the, muslim, conquest, had, caused, a, mass, flight, of, greek, christian, urbanites, from, damascus, aleppo, latakia, and, tripoli, to, byzantine, territory, while, those, who, remained, held, pro, byzantine, sympathies, in, contrast, to, the, other, conquered, regions, of, the, caliphate, where, new, garrison, cities, were, established, to, house, muslim, troops, and, their, administration, in, syria, the, troops, settled, in, existing, cities, including, damascus, homs, jerusalem, tiberias, aleppo, and, qinnasrin, mu, awiya, restored, repopulated, and, garrisoned,

areas, north, of, the, euphrates, in, the, vicinity, of, raqqa, mu, awiya, initiated, the, arab, naval, campaigns, against, the, byzantines, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, requisitioning, the, harbors, of, tripoli, beirut, tyre, acre, and, jaffa, umar, had, rejected, mu, awiya, s, request, to, launch, a, naval, invasion, of, cyprus, citing, concerns, about, the, muslim, forces, safety, at, sea, but, uthman, allowed, him, to, commence, the, campaign, in, 647, after, refusing, an, earlier, entreaty, mu, awiya, s, rationale, was, that, the, byzantine, held, island, posed, a, threat, to, arab, positions, along, the, syrian, coast, and, that, it, could, be, easily, neutralized, the, exact, year, of, the, raid, is, unclear, with, the, early, arabic, sources, providing, a, range, between, 647, and, 650, while, two, greek, inscriptions, in, the, cypriot, village, of, solois, cite, two, raids, launched, between, 648, and, 650, according, to, the, 9th, century, historians, al, baladhuri, and, khalifa, ibn, khayyat, mu, awiya, led, the, raid, in, person, accompanied, by, his, wife, katwa, bint, qaraza, ibn, abd, amr, of, the, qurayshite, banu, nawfal, alongside, the, commander, ubada, ibn, al, samit, katwa, died, on, the, island, and, at, some, point, mu, awiya, married, her, sister, fakhita, in, a, different, narrative, by, the, early, muslim, sources, the, raid, was, instead, conducted, by, mu, awiya, s, admiral, abd, allah, ibn, qays, who, landed, at, salamis, before, occupying, the, island, in, either, case, the, cypriots, were, forced, to, pay, a, tribute, equal, to, that, which, they, had, paid, the, byzantines, mu, awiya, established, a, garrison, and, a, mosque, to, maintain, the, caliphate, s, influence, on, the, island, which, became, a, staging, ground, for, the, arabs, and, the, byzantines, to, launch, raids, against, each, other, s, territories, the, inhabitants, of, cyprus, were, largely, left, to, their, own, devices, and, archaeological, evidence, indicates, uninterrupted, prosperity, during, this, period, dominance, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, enabled, mu, awiya, s, naval, forces, to, raid, crete, and, rhodes, in, 653, from,

emperor, practically, conceded, when, he, withdrew, from, armenia, that, year, in, 655, mu, awiya, s, lieutenant, commander, habib, ibn, maslama, al, fihri, captured, theodosiopolis, and, deported,

policies, in, the, 650s, the, exception, was, abu, dharr, al, ghifari, who, had, been, sent, to, damascus, for, openly, condemning, uthman, s, enrichment, of, his, kinsmen, he, criticized, the,

governor, to, syria, who, was, denied, entry, into, the, province, by, mu, awiya, this, is, rejected, by, madelung, according, to, whom, no, formal, relations, existed, between, the, caliph, and, the, governor, of, syria, for, seven, months, from, the, date, of, ali, s, election, soon, after, becoming, caliph, ali, was, opposed, by, much, of, the, quraysh, led, by, al, zubayr, and, talha, both, prominent, companions, of, muhammad, and, muhammad, s, wife, a, isha, who, feared, the, loss, of, their, own, influence, under, ali, the, ensuing, civil, war, became, known, as, the, first, fitna, ali, defeated, the, triumvirate, near, basra, at, the, battle, of, the, camel, which, ended, in, the, deaths, of, al, zubayr, and, talha, both, potential, contenders, for, the, caliphate, and, the,

had, a, strong, and, loyal, power, base, demanded, revenge, for, the, slaying, of, his, umayyad, kinsman, uthman, and, could, not, be, easily, replaced, at, this, point, mu, awiya, did, not, yet, claim, the, caliphate, and, his, principal, aim, was, keeping, power, in, syria, ali, s, victory, in, basra, left, mu, awiya, vulnerable, his, territory, wedged, between, ali, s, forces, in, iraq, and, egypt, while, the, war, with, the, byzantines, was, ongoing, in, the, north, in, 657, or, 658, mu, awiya, secured, his, northern, frontier, with, byzantium, by, making, a, truce, with, the, emperor, enabling, him, to, focus, the, bulk, of, his, troops, on, the, impending, battle, with, the, caliph, after, failing, to, gain, the, defection, of, egypt, s, governor, qays, ibn, sa, d, he, resolved, to, end, the, umayyad, family, s, hostility, to, amr, ibn, al, as, the, conqueror, and, former, governor, of, egypt, whom, they, accused, of, involvement, in, uthman, s, death, mu, awiya, and, amr, who, was, popular, with, the, arab, troops, of, egypt, made, a, pact, whereby, the, latter, joined, the, coalition, against, ali, and, mu, awiya, publicly, agreed, to, install, amr, as, egypt, s, lifetime, governor, should, they, oust, ali, s, appointee, although, he, had, the, firm, backing, of, the, kalb, to, shore, up, the, rest, of, his, base, in, syria, mu, awiya, was, advised, by, his, kinsman, al, walid, ibn, uqba, to, secure, an, alliance, with, the, yemenite, tribes, of, himyar, kinda, and, hamdan, who, collectively, dominated, the, homs, garrison, he, employed, the, veteran, commander, and, kindite, nobleman, shurahbil, ibn, simt, who, was, widely, respected, in, syria, to, rally, the, yemenites, to, his, side, he, then, enlisted, support, from, the, dominant, tribal, leader, of, palestine, the, judham, chief, natil, ibn, qays, by, allowing, the, latter, s, confiscation, of, the, district, s, treasury, to, go, unpunished, the, efforts, bore, fruit, and, demands, for, war, against, ali, grew, throughout, mu, awiya, s, domain, when, ali, sent, his, envoy, the, veteran, commander, and, chieftain, of, the, bajila, jarir, ibn, abd, allah, to, mu, awiya, the, latter, responded, with, a, letter, that, amounted, to, a, declaration, of, war, against, the, caliph, whose, legitimacy, he, refused, to, recognize, in, the, first, week, of, june, 657, the, armies, of, mu, awiya, and, ali, met, at, siffin, near, raqqa, and, engaged, in, days, of, skirmishes, interrupted, by, a, month, long, truce, on, 19, june, during, the, truce, mu, awiya, dispatched, an, embassy, led, by, habib, ibn, maslama, who, presented, ali, with, an, ultimatum, to, hand, over, uthman, s, alleged, killers, abdicate, and, allow, a, shura, consultative, council, to, decide, the, caliphate, ali, rebuffed, mu, awiya, s, envoys, and, on, 18, july, declared, that, the, syrians, remained, obstinate, in, their, refusal, to, recognize, his, sovereignty, on, the, following, day, a, week, of, duels, between, ali, s, and, mu, awiya, s, top, commanders, ensued, the, main, battle, between, the, two, armies, commenced, on, 26, july, as, ali, s, troops, advanced, toward, mu, awiya, s, tent, the, governor, of, syria, ordered, his, elite, troops, forward, and, they, bested, the, iraqis, before, the, tide, turned, against, the, syrians, the, next, day, with, the, deaths, of, two, of, mu, awiya, s, leading, commanders, ubayd, allah, a, son, of, caliph, umar, and, dhu, l, kala, samayfa, the, so, called, king, of, himyar, mu, awiya, rejected, suggestions, from, his, advisers, to, engage, ali, in, a, duel, and, definitively, end, hostilities, the, battle, climaxed, on, the, so, called, night, of, clamor, on, 28, july, which, saw, ali, s, forces, take, the, advantage, in, a, mel, e, as, the, death, toll, mounted, on, both, sides, according, to, the, account, of, the, scholar, al, zuhri, d, 742, this, prompted, amr, ibn, al, as, to, counsel, mu, awiya, the, following, morning, to, have, a, number, of, his, men, tie, leaves, of, the, qur, an, on, their, lances, in, an, appeal, to, the, iraqis, to, settle, the, conflict, through, consultation, according, to, the, scholar, al, sha, bi, d, 723, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, who, was, in, ali, s, army, expressed, his, fears, of, byzantine, and, persian, attacks, were, the, muslims, to, exhaust, themselves, in, the, civil, war, upon, receiving, intelligence, of, this, mu, awiya, ordered, the, raising, of, the, qur, an, leaves, though, this, act, represented, a, surrender, of, sorts, as, mu, awiya, abandoned, at, least, temporarily, his, previous, insistence, on, settling, the, dispute, with, ali, militarily, and, pursuing, uthman, s, killers, into, iraq, it, had, the, effect, of, sowing, discord, and, uncertainty, in, ali, s, ranks, the, caliph, adhered, to, the, will, of, the, majority, in, his, army, and, accepted, the, proposal, to, arbitrate, moreover, ali, agreed, to, amr, s, or, mu, awiya, s, demand, to, omit, his, formal, title, amir, al, mu, minin, commander, of, the, faithful, the, traditional, title, of, a, caliph, from, the, initial, arbitration, document, according, to, the, historian, hugh, n, kennedy, the, agreement, forced, ali, to, deal, with, mu, awiya, on, equal, terms, and, abandon, his, unchallenged, right, to, lead, the, community, madelung, asserts, it, handed, mu, awiya, a, moral, victory, before, inducing, a, disastrous, split, in, the, ranks, of, ali, s, men, indeed, upon, ali, s, return, to, his, capital, kufa, in, september, 658, a, large, segment, of, his, troops, who, had, opposed, the, arbitration, defected, inaugurating, the, kharijite, movement, the, initial, agreement, postponed, the, arbitration, to, a, later, date, information, in, the, early, muslim, sources, about, the, time, place, and, outcome, of, the, arbitration, is, contradictory, but, there, were, likely, two, meetings, between, mu, awiya, s, and, ali, s, respective, representatives, amr, and, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, the, first, in, dumat, al, jandal, and, the, last, in, adhruh, ali, abandoned, the, arbitration, after, the, first, meeting, in, which, abu, musa, who, unlike, amr, was, not, particularly, attached, to, his, principal, s, cause, accepted, the, syrian, side, s, claim, that, uthman, was, wrongfully, killed, a, verdict, that, ali, opposed, the, final, meeting, in, adhruh, which, had, been, convened, at, mu, awiya, s, request, collapsed, but, by, then, mu, awiya, had, emerged, as, a, major, contender, for, the, caliphate, following, the, breakdown, of, the, arbitration, talks, amr, and, the, syrian, delegates, returned, to, damascus, where, they, greeted, mu, awiya, as, amir, al, mu, minin, signaling, their, recognition, of, him, as, caliph, in, april, or, may, 658, mu, awiya, received, a, general, pledge, of, allegiance, from, the, syrians, in, response, ali, broke, off, communications, with, mu, awiya, mobilized, for, war, and, invoked, a, curse, against, mu, awiya, and, his, close, retinue, as, a, ritual, in, the, morning, prayers, mu, awiya, reciprocated, in, kind, against, ali, and, his, closest, supporters, in, his, own, domain, in, july, mu, awiya, dispatched, an, army, under, amr, to, egypt, after, a, request, for, intervention, from, pro, uthman, mutineers, in, the, province, who, were, being, suppressed, by, the, governor, caliph, abu, bakr, s, son, and, ali, s, stepson, muhammad, the, latter, s, troops, were, defeated, by, amr, s, forces, the, provincial, capital, fustat, was, captured, and, muhammad, was, executed, on, the, orders, of, mu, awiya, ibn, hudayj, leader, of, the, pro, uthman, rebels, the, loss, of, egypt, was, a, major, blow, to, the, authority, of, ali, who, was, bogged, down, battling, kharijite, defectors, in, iraq, and, whose, grip, in, basra, and, iraq, s, eastern, and, southern, dependencies, was, eroding, though, his, hand, was, strengthened, mu, awiya, refrained, from, launching, a, direct, assault, against, ali, instead, his, strategy, was, to, bribe, the, tribal, chieftains, in, ali, s, army, to, his, side, and, harry, the, inhabitants, along, iraq, s, western, frontier, the, first, raid, was, conducted, by, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, al, fihri, against, nomads, and, muslim, pilgrims, in, the, desert, west, of, kufa, this, was, followed, by, nu, man, ibn, bashir, al, ansari, s, abortive, attack, on, ayn, al, tamr, then, in, the, summer, of, 660, sufyan, ibn, awf, s, successful, raids, against, hit, and, anbar, in, 659, or, 660, mu, awiya, expanded, the, operations, to, the, hejaz, western, arabia, where, mecca, and, medina, are, located, sending, abd, allah, ibn, mas, ada, al, fazari, to, collect, the, alms, tax, and, oaths, of, allegiance, to, mu, awiya, from, the, inhabitants, of, the, tayma, oasis, this, initial, foray, was, defeated, by, the, kufans, while, an, attempt, to, extract, oaths, of, allegiance, from, the, quraysh, of, mecca, in, april, 660, also, failed, in, the, summer, mu, awiya, dispatched, a, large, army, under, busr, ibn, abi, artat, to, conquer, the, hejaz, and, yemen, he, directed, busr, to, intimidate, medina, s, inhabitants, without, harming, them, spare, the, meccans, and, kill, anyone, in, yemen, who, refused, to, pledge, their, allegiance, busr, advanced, through, medina, mecca, and, ta, if, encountering, no, resistance, and, gaining, those, cities, recognition, of, mu, awiya, in, yemen, busr, executed, several, notables, in, najran, and, its, vicinity, on, account, of, past, criticism, of, uthman, or, ties, to, ali, massacred, numerous, tribesmen, of, the, hamdan, and, townspeople, from, sana, a, and, ma, rib, before, he, could, continue, his, campaign, in, hadhramawt, he, withdrew, upon, the, approach, of, a, kufan, relief, force, news, of, busr, s, actions, in, arabia, spurred, ali, s, troops, to, rally, behind, his, planned, campaign, against, mu, awiya, but, the, expedition, was, aborted, as, a, result, of, ali, s, assassination, by, a, kharijite, in, january, 661, after, ali, was, killed, mu, awiya, left, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, in, charge, of, syria, and, led, his, army, toward, kufa, where, ali, s, son, hasan, had, been, nominated, as, his, successor, he, successfully, bribed, ubayd, allah, ibn, abbas, the, commander, of, hasan, s, vanguard, to, desert, his, post, and, sent, envoys, to, negotiate, with, hasan, in, return, for, a, financial, settlement, hasan, abdicated, and, mu, awiya, entered, kufa, in, july, or, september, 661, and, was, recognized, as, caliph, this, year, is, considered, by, a, number, of, the, early, muslim, sources, as, the, year, of, unity, and, is, generally, regarded, as, the, start, of, mu, awiya, s, caliphate, before, and, or, after, ali, s, death, mu, awiya, received, oaths, of, allegiance, in, one, or, two, formal, ceremonies, in, jerusalem, the, first, in, late, 660, or, early, 661, and, the, second, in, july, 661, the, 10th, century, jerusalemite, geographer, al, maqdisi, holds, that, mu, awiya, had, further, developed, a, mosque, originally, built, by, caliph, umar, on, the, temple, mount, the, precursor, of, the, jami, al, aqsa, and, received, his, formal, oaths, of, allegiance, there, according, to, the, earliest, extant, source, about, mu, awiya, s, accession, in, jerusalem, the, near, contemporaneous, maronite, chronicles, composed, by, an, anonymous, syriac, author, mu, awiya, received, the, pledges, of, the, tribal, chieftains, and, then, prayed, at, golgotha, and, the, tomb, of, the, virgin, mary, in, gethsemane, both, adjacent, to, the, temple, mount, the, maronite, chronicles, also, maintain, that, mu, awiya, did, not, wear, a, crown, like, other, kings, in, the, world, there, is, little, information, in, the, early, muslim, sources, about, mu, awiya, s, rule, in, syria, the, center, of, his, caliphate, he, established, his, court, in, damascus, and, moved, the, caliphal, treasury, there, from, kufa, he, relied, on, his, syrian, tribal, soldiery, numbering, about, 100, 000, men, increasing, their, pay, at, the, expense, of, the, iraqi, garrisons, also, about, 100, 000, soldiers, combined, the, highest, stipends, were, paid, on, an, inheritable, basis, to, 2, 000, nobles, of, the, quda, a, and, kinda, tribes, the, core, components, of, his, support, base, who, were, further, awarded, the, privilege, of, consultation, for, all, major, decisions, and, the, rights, to, veto, or, propose, measures, the, respective, leaders, of, the, quda, a, and, the, kinda, the, kalbite, chief, ibn, bahdal, and, the, homs, based, shurahbil, formed, part, of, his, syrian, inner, circle, along, with, the, qurayshites, abd, al, rahman, ibn, khalid, son, of, the, distinguished, commander, khalid, ibn, al, walid, and, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, mu, awiya, is, credited, by, the, early, muslim, sources, for, establishing, diwans, government, departments, for, correspondences, rasa, il, chancellery, khatam, and, the, postal, route, barid, according, to, al, tabari, following, an, assassination, attempt, by, the, kharijite, al, burak, ibn, abd, allah, on, mu, awiya, while, he, was, praying, in, the, mosque, of, damascus, in, 661, mu, awiya, established, a, caliphal, haras, personal, guard, and, shurta, select, troops, and, the, maqsura, reserved, area, within, mosques, the, caliph, s, treasury, was, largely, dependent, on, the, tax, revenues, of, syria, and, income, from, the, crown, lands, that, he, confiscated, in, iraq, and, arabia, he, also, received, the, customary, fifth, of, the, war, booty, acquired, by, his, commanders, during, expeditions, in, the, jazira, mu, awiya, coped, with, the, tribal, influx, which, spanned, previously, established, groups, such, as, the, sulaym, newcomers, from, the, mudar, and, rabi, a, confederations, and, civil, war, refugees, from, kufa, and, basra, by, administratively, detaching, the, military, district, of, qinnasrin, jazira, from, homs, according, to, the, 8th, century, historian, sayf, ibn, umar, however, al, baladhuri, attributes, this, change, to, mu, awiya, s, successor, yazid, i, r, 680, 683, syria, retained, its, byzantine, era, bureaucracy, which, was, staffed, by, christians, including, the, head, of, the, tax, administration, sarjun, ibn, mansur, the, latter, had, served, mu, awiya, in, the, same, capacity, before, his, attainment, of, the, caliphate, and, sarjun, s, father, was, the, likely, holder, of, the, office, under, emperor, heraclius, r, 610, 641, mu, awiya, was, tolerant, toward, syria, s, native, christian, majority, in, turn, the, community, was, generally, satisfied, with, his, rule, under, which, their, conditions, were, at, least, as, favorable, as, under, the, byzantines, mu, awiya, attempted, to, mint, his, own, coins, but, the, new, currency, was, rejected, by, the, syrians, as, it, omitted, the, symbol, of, the, cross, the, sole, epigraphic, attestation, to, mu, awiya, s, rule, in, syria, a, greek, inscription, dated, to, 663, discovered, at, the, hot, springs, of, hamat, gader, near, the, sea, of, galilee, refers, to, the, caliph, as, abd, allah, mu, awiya, amir, al, mu, minin, god, s, servant, mu, awiya, commander, of, the, faithful, the, caliph, s, name, is, preceded, by, a, cross, and, credits, him, for, restoring, roman, era, bath, facilities, for, the, benefit, of, the, sick, according, to, the, historian, yizhar, hirschfeld, by, this, deed, the, new, caliph, sought, to, please, his, christian, subjects, the, caliph, often, spent, his, winters, at, his, sinnabra, palace, near, the, sea, of, galilee, mu, awiya, was, also, credited, with, ordering, the, restoration, of, edessa, s, church, after, it, was, ruined, in, an, earthquake, in, 679, he, demonstrated, a, keen, interest, in, jerusalem, although, archaeological, evidence, is, lacking, there, are, indications, in, medieval, literary, sources, that, a, rudimentary, mosque, on, the, temple, mount, existed, as, early, as, mu, awiya, s, time, or, was, built, by, him, mu, awiya, s, primary, internal, challenge, was, overseeing, a, syria, based, government, that, could, reunite, the, politically, and, socially, fractured, caliphate, and, assert, authority, over, the, tribes, which, formed, its, armies, he, applied, indirect, rule, to, the, caliphate, s, provinces, appointing, governors, with, full, civil, and, military, authority, although, in, principle, governors, were, obliged, to, forward, surplus, tax, revenues, to, the, caliph, in, practice, most, of, the, surplus, was, distributed, among, the, provincial, garrisons, and, damascus, received, a, negligible, share, during, mu, awiya, s, caliphate, the, governors, relied, on, the, ashraf, tribal, chieftains, who, served, as, intermediaries, between, the, authorities, and, the, tribesmen, in, the, garrisons, mu, awiya, s, statecraft, was, likely, inspired, by, his, father, who, utilized, his, wealth, to, establish, political, alliances, the, caliph, generally, preferred, bribing, his, opponents, over, direct, confrontation, in, the, summation, of, kennedy, mu, awiya, ruled, by, making, agreements, with, those, who, held, power, in, the, provinces, by, building, up, the, power, of, those, who, were, prepared, to, co, operate, with, him, and, by, attaching, as, many, important, and, influential, figures, to, his, cause, as, possible, challenges, to, central, authority, in, general, and, to, mu, awiya, s, rule, in, particular, were, most, acute, in, iraq, where, divisions, were, rife, between, the, ashraf, upstarts, and, the, nascent, muslim, elite, the, latter, of, which, was, further, divided, between, ali, s, partisans, and, the, kharijites, mu, awiya, s, ascent, signaled, the, rise, of, the, kufan, ashraf, represented, by, ali, s, erstwhile, backers, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, and, jarir, ibn, abd, allah, at, the, expense, of, ali, s, old, guard, represented, by, hujr, ibn, adi, and, ibrahim, the, son, of, ali, s, leading, aide, malik, al, ashtar, mu, awiya, s, initial, choice, to, govern, kufa, in, 661, was, al, mughira, ibn, shu, ba, who, possessed, considerable, administrative, and, military, experience, in, iraq, and, was, highly, familiar, with, the, region, s, inhabitants, and, issues, under, his, nearly, decade, long, administration, al, mughira, maintained, peace, in, the, city, overlooked, transgressions, that, did, not, threaten, his, rule, allowed, the, kufans, to, keep, possession, of, the, lucrative, sasanian, crown, lands, in, the, jibal, district, and, unlike, under, past, administrations, consistently, and, timely, paid, the, garrison, s, stipends, in, basra, mu, awiya, reappointed, his, abd, shams, kinsman, abd, allah, ibn, amir, who, had, served, in, the, office, under, uthman, during, mu, awiya, s, reign, ibn, amir, recommenced, expeditions, into, sistan, reaching, as, far, as, kabul, he, was, unable, to, maintain, order, in, basra, where, there, was, growing, resentment, toward, the, distant, campaigns, consequently, mu, awiya, replaced, ibn, amir, with, ziyad, ibn, abihi, in, 664, or, 665, the, latter, had, been, the, longest, of, ali, s, loyalists, to, withhold, recognition, of, mu, awiya, s, caliphate, and, had, barricaded, himself, in, the, istakhr, fortress, in, fars, busr, had, threatened, to, execute, three, of, ziyad, s, young, sons, in, basra, to, force, his, surrender, but, ziyad, was, ultimately, persuaded, by, al, mughira, his, mentor, to, submit, to, mu, awiya, s, authority, in, 663, in, a, controversial, step, that, secured, the, loyalty, of, the, fatherless, ziyad, whom, the, caliph, viewed, as, the, most, capable, candidate, to, govern, basra, mu, awiya, adopted, him, as, his, paternal, half, brother, to, the, protests, of, his, own, son, yazid, ibn, amir, and, his, umayyad, kinsmen, in, the, hejaz, following, al, mughira, s, death, in, 670, mu, awiya, attached, kufa, and, its, dependencies, to, ziyad, s, basran, governorship, making, him, the, caliph, s, virtual, viceroy, over, the, eastern, half, of, the, caliphate, ziyad, tackled, iraq, s, core, economic, problem, of, overpopulation, in, the, garrison, cities, and, the, consequent, scarcity, of, resources, by, reducing, the, number, of, troops, on, the, payrolls, and, dispatching, 50, 000, iraqi, soldiers, and, their, families, to, settle, khurasan, this, also, consolidated, the, previously, weak, and, unstable, arab, position, in, the, caliphate, s, easternmost, province, and, enabled, conquests, toward, transoxiana, as, part, of, his, reorganization, efforts, in, kufa, ziyad, confiscated, its, garrison, s, crown, lands, which, thenceforth, became, the, possession, of, the, caliph, opposition, to, the, confiscations, raised, by, hujr, ibn, adi, whose, pro, alid, advocacy, had, been, tolerated, by, al, mughira, was, violently, suppressed, by, ziyad, hujr, and, his, retinue, were, sent, to, mu, awiya, for, punishment, and, were, executed, on, the, caliph, s, orders, marking, the, first, political, execution, in, islamic, history, and, serving, as, a, harbinger, for, future, pro, alid, uprisings, in, kufa, ziyad, died, in, 673, and, his, son, ubayd, allah, was, appointed, gradually, by, mu, awiya, to, all, of, his, father, s, former, offices, in, effect, by, relying, on, al, mughira, and, ziyad, and, his, sons, mu, awiya, franchised, the, administration, of, iraq, and, the, eastern, caliphate, to, members, of, the, elite, thaqif, clan, which, had, long, established, ties, to, the, quraysh, and, were, instrumental, in, the, conquest, of, iraq, in, egypt, amr, governed, more, as, a, partner, of, mu, awiya, than, a, subordinate, until, his, death, in, 664, he, was, permitted, to, retain, the, surplus, revenues, of, the, province, the, caliph, ordered, the, resumption, of, egyptian, grain, and, oil, shipments, to, medina, ending, the, hiatus, caused, by, the, first, fitna, after, amr, s, death, mu, awiya, s, brother, utba, r, 664, 665, and, an, early, companion, of, muhammad, uqba, ibn, amir, r, 665, 667, successively, served, as, governors, before, mu, awiya, appointed, maslama, ibn, mukhallad, al, ansari, in, 667, maslama, remained, governor, for, the, duration, of, mu, awiya, s, reign, significantly, expanding, fustat, and, its, mosque, and, boosting, the, city, s, importance, in, 674, by, relocating, egypt, s, main, shipyard, to, the, nearby, roda, island, from, alexandria, due, to, the, latter, s, vulnerability, to, byzantine, naval, raids, the, arab, presence, in, egypt, was, mostly, limited, to, the, central, garrison, at, fustat, and, the, smaller, garrison, at, alexandria, the, influx, of, syrian, troops, brought, by, amr, in, 658, and, the, basran, troops, sent, by, ziyad, in, 673, swelled, fustat, s, 15, 000, strong, garrison, to, 40, 000, during, mu, awiya, s, reign, utba, increased, the, alexandria, garrison, to, 12, 000, men, and, built, a, governor, s, residence, in, the, city, whose, greek, christian, population, was, generally, hostile, to, arab, rule, when, utba, s, deputy, in, alexandria, complained, that, his, troops, were, unable, to, control, the, city, mu, awiya, deployed, a, further, 15, 000, soldiers, from, syria, and, medina, the, troops, in, egypt, were, far, less, rebellious, than, their, iraqi, counterparts, though, elements, in, the, fustat, garrison, occasionally, raised, opposition, to, mu, awiya, s, policies, culminating, during, maslama, s, term, with, the, widespread, protest, at, mu, awiya, s, seizure, and, allotment, of, crown, lands, in, fayyum, to, his, son, yazid, which, compelled, the, caliph, to, reverse, his, order, although, revenge, for, uthman, s, assassination, had, been, the, basis, upon, which, mu, awiya, claimed, the, right, to, the, caliphate, he, neither, emulated, uthman, s, empowerment, of, the, umayyad, clan, nor, used, them, to, assert, his, own, power, with, minor, exceptions, members, of, the, clan, were, not, appointed, to, the, wealthy, provinces, nor, the, caliph, s, court, mu, awiya, largely, limiting, their, influence, to, medina, the, old, capital, of, the, caliphate, where, most, of, the, umayyads, and, the, wider, qurayshite, former, aristocracy, remained, headquartered, the, loss, of, political, power, left, the, umayyads, of, medina, resentful, toward, mu, awiya, who, may, have, become, wary, of, the, political, ambitions, of, the, much, larger, abu, al, as, branch, of, the, clan, to, which, uthman, had, belonged, under, the, leadership, of, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, the, caliph, attempted, to, weaken, the, clan, by, provoking, internal, divisions, among, the, measures, taken, was, the, replacement, of, marwan, from, the, governorship, of, medina, in, 668, with, another, leading, umayyad, sa, id, ibn, al, as, the, latter, was, instructed, to, demolish, marwan, s, house, but, refused, and, when, marwan, was, restored, in, 674, he, also, refused, mu, awiya, s, order, to, demolish, sa, id, s, house, mu, awiya, dismissed, marwan, once, more, in, 678, replacing, him, with, his, own, nephew, al, walid, ibn, utba, besides, his, own, clan, mu, awiya, s, relations, with, the, banu, hashim, the, clan, of, muhammad, and, caliph, ali, the, families, of, muhammad, s, closest, companions, the, once, prominent, banu, makhzum, and, the, ansar, was, generally, characterized, by, suspicion, or, outright, hostility, despite, his, relocation, to, damascus, mu, awiya, remained, fond, of, his, original, homeland, and, made, known, his, longing, for, the, spring, in, juddah, the, summer, in, ta, if, the, winter, in, mecca, he, purchased, several, large, tracts, throughout, arabia, and, invested, considerable, sums, to, develop, the, lands, for, agricultural, use, according, to, the, muslim, literary, tradition, in, the, plain, of, arafat, and, the, barren, valley, of, mecca, he, dug, numerous, wells, and,

awiya, confiscated, from, the, banu, hanifa, the, lands, of, hadarim, where, he, employed, 4, 000, slaves, likely, to, cultivate, its, fields, the, caliph, gained, possession, of, estates, in, and, near, ta, if, which, together, with, the, lands, of, his, brothers, anbasa, and, utba, formed, a, considerable, cluster, of, properties, one, of, the, earliest, known, arabic, inscriptions, from, mu, awiya, s, reign, was, found, at, a, soil, conservation, dam, called, sayisad, 32, kilometers, 20, mi, east, of, ta, if, which, credits, mu, awiya, for, the, dam, s, construction, in, 677, or, 678,

to, an, inscription, found, at, the, site, this, is, possibly, the, dam, between, medina, and, the, gold, mines, of, the, banu, sulaym, tribe, attributed, to, mu, awiya, by, the, historians, al, harbi, d, 898, and, al, samhudi, d, 1533, mu, awiya, possessed, more, personal, experience, than, any, other, caliph, fighting, the, byzantines, the, principal, external, threat, to, the, caliphate, and, pursued, the, war, against, the, empire, more, energetically, and, continuously, than, his, successors, the, first, fitna, caused, the, arabs, to, lose, control, over, armenia, to, native, pro, byzantine, princes, but, in, 661, habib, ibn, maslama, re, invaded, the, region, the, following, year, armenia, became, a, tributary, of, the, caliphate, and, mu, awiya, recognized, the, armenian, prince, grigor, mamikonian, as, its, commander, not, long, after, the, civil, war, mu, awiya, broke, the, truce, with, byzantium, and, on, a, near, annual, or, bi, annual, basis, the, caliph, engaged, his, syrian, troops, in, raids, across, the, mountainous, anatolian, frontier, the, buffer, zone, between, the, empire, and, the, caliphate, at, least, until, abd, al, rahman, ibn, khalid, s, death, in, 666, homs, served, as, the, principal, marshaling, point, for, the, offensives, and, afterward, antioch, served, this, purpose, as, well, the, bulk, of, the, troops, fighting, on, the, anatolian, and, armenian, fronts, hailed, from, the, tribal, groups, that, arrived, from, arabia, during, and, after, the, conquest, during, his, caliphate, mu, awiya, continued, his, past, efforts, to, resettle, and, fortify, the, syrian, port, cities, due, to, the, reticence, of, arab, tribesmen, to, inhabit, the, coastlands, in, 663, mu, awiya, moved, persian, civilians, and, personnel, that, he, had, previously, settled, in, the, syrian, interior, into, acre, and, tyre, and, transferred, asawira, elite, persian, soldiers, from, kufa, and, basra, to, the, garrison, at, antioch, a, few, years, later, mu, awiya, settled, apamea, with, 5, 000, slavs, who, had, defected, from, the, byzantines, during, one, of, his, forces, anatolian, campaigns, based, on, the, histories, of, al, tabari, d, 923, and, agapius, of, hierapolis, d, 941, the, first, raid, of, mu, awiya, s, caliphate, occurred, in, 662, or, 663, during, which, his, forces, inflicted, a, heavy, defeat, on, a, byzantine, army, with, numerous, patricians, slain, in, the, next, year, a, raid, led, by, busr, reached, constantinople, and, in, 664, or, 665, abd, al, rahman, ibn, khalid, raided, koloneia, in, northeastern, anatolia, in, the, late, 660s, mu, awiya, s, forces, attacked, antioch, of, pisidia, or, antioch, of, isauria, following, the, death, of, constans, ii, in, july, 668, mu, awiya, oversaw, an, increasingly, aggressive, policy, of, naval, warfare, against, the, byzantines, according, to, the, early, muslim, sources, raids, against, the, byzantines, peaked, between, 668, and, 669, in, each, of, those, years, there, occurred, six, ground, campaigns, and, a, major, naval, campaign, the, first, by, an, egyptian, and, medinese, fleet, and, the, second, by, an, egyptian, and, syrian, fleet, the, culmination, of, the, campaigns, was, an, assault, on, constantinople, but, the, chronologies, of, the, arabic, syriac, and, byzantine, sources, are, contradictory, the, traditional, view, by, modern, historians, is, of, a, great, series, of, naval, borne, assaults, against, constantinople, in, c, 674, 678, based, on, the, history, of, the, byzantine, chronicler, theophanes, the, confessor, d, 818, however, the, dating, and, the, very, historicity, of, this, view, has, been, challenged, the, oxford, scholar, james, howard, johnston, considers, that, no, siege, of, constantinople, took, place, and, that, the, story, was, inspired, by, the, actual, siege, a, generation, later, the, historian, marek, jankowiak, on, the, other, hand, in, a, revisionist, reconstruction, of, the, events, reliant, on, the, arabic, and, syriac, sources, asserts, that, the, assault, came, earlier, than, what, is, reported, by, theophanes, and, that, the, multitude, of, campaigns, that, were, reported, during, 668, 669, represented, the, coordinated, efforts, by, mu, awiya, to, conquer, the, byzantine, capital, al, tabari, reports, that, mu, awiya, s, son, yazid, led, a, campaign, against, constantinople, in, 669, and, ibn, abd, al, hakam, reports, that, the, egyptian, and, syrian, navies, joined, the, assault, led, by, uqba, ibn, amir, and, fadala, ibn, ubayd, respectively, according, to, jankowiak, mu, awiya, likely, ordered, the, invasion, during, an, opportunity, presented, by, the, rebellion, of, the, byzantine, armenian, general, saborios, who, formed, a, pact, with, the, caliph, in, spring, 667, the, caliph, dispatched, an, army, under, fadala, but, before, it, could, be, joined, by, the, armenians, saborios, died, mu, awiya, then, sent, reinforcements, led, by, yazid, who, led, the, arab, army, s, invasion, in, the, summer, an, arab, fleet, reached, the, sea, of, marmara, by, autumn, while, yazid, and, fadala, having, raided, chalcedon, through, the, winter, besieged, constantinople, in, spring, 668, but, due, to, famine, and, disease, lifted, the, siege, in, late, june, the, arabs, continued, their, campaigns, in, constantinople, s, vicinity, before, withdrawing, to, syria, most, likely, in, late, 669, in, 669, mu, awiya, s, navy, raided, as, far, as, sicily, the, following, year, the, wide, scale, fortification, of, alexandria, was, completed, while, the, histories, of, al, tabari, and, al, baladhuri, report, that, mu, awiya, s, forces, captured, rhodes, in, 672, 674, and, colonized, the, island, for, seven, years, before, withdrawing, during, the, reign, of, yazid, i, the, modern, historian, clifford, edmund, bosworth, casts, doubt, on, these, events, and, holds, that, the, island, was, only, raided, by, mu, awiya, s, lieutenant, junada, ibn, abi, umayya, al, azdi, in, 679, or, 680, under, emperor, constantine, iv, r, 668, 685, the, byzantines, began, a, counteroffensive, against, the, caliphate, first, raiding, egypt, in, 672, or, 673, while, in, winter, 673, mu, awiya, s, admiral, abd, allah, ibn, qays, led, a, large, fleet, that, raided, smyrna, and, the, coasts, of, cilicia, and, lycia, the, byzantines, landed, a, major, victory, against, an, arab, army, and, fleet, led, by, sufyan, ibn, awf, possibly, at, sillyon, in, 673, or, 674, the, next, year, abd, allah, ibn, qays, and, fadala, landed, in, crete, and, in, 675, or, 676, a, byzantine, fleet, assaulted, maraclea, killing, the, governor, of, homs, in, 677, 678, or, 679, according, to, theophanes, mu, awiya, sued, for, peace, with, constantine, iv, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, destruction, of, his, fleet, or, the, byzantines, deployment, of, the, mardaites, in, the, syrian, littoral, during, that, time, a, thirty, year, treaty, was, concluded, obliging, the, caliphate, to, pay, an, annual, tribute, of, 3, 000, gold, coins, 50, horses, and, 30, slaves, and, withdraw, their, troops, from, the, forward, bases, they, had, occupied, on, the, byzantine, coast, but, other, byzantine, and, islamic, sources, make, no, mention, of, this, treaty, although, the, muslims, did, not, achieve, any, permanent, territorial, gains, in, anatolia, during, mu, awiya, s, career, the, frequent, raids, provided, mu, awiya, s, syrian, troops, with, war, spoils, and, tribute, which, helped, ensure, their, continued, allegiance, and, sharpened, their, combat, skills, moreover, mu, awiya, s, prestige, was, boosted, and, the, byzantines, were, precluded, from, any, concerted, campaigns, against, syria, although, the, arabs, had, not, advanced, beyond, cyrenaica, since, the, 640s, other, than, periodic, raids, the, expeditions, against, byzantine, north, africa, were, renewed, during, mu, awiya, s, reign, in, 665, or, 666, ibn, hudayj, led, an, army, which, raided, byzacena, southern, district, of, byzantine, africa, and, gabes, and, temporarily, captured, bizerte, before, withdrawing, to, egypt, the, following, year, mu, awiya, dispatched, fadala, and, ruwayfi, ibn, thabit, to, raid, the, commercially, valuable, island, of, djerba, meanwhile, in, 662, or, 667, uqba, ibn, nafi, a, qurayshite, commander, who, had, played, a, key, role, in, the, arabs, capture, of, cyrenaica, in, 641, reasserted, muslim, influence, in, the, fezzan, region, capturing, the, zawila, oasis, and, the, garamantes, capital, of, germa,

mu, awiya, appointed, uqba, as, egypt, s, deputy, governor, over, the, north, african, lands, under, arab, control, west, of, egypt, at, the, head, of, a, 10, 000, strong, force, uqba, commenced, his, expedition, against, the, territories, west, of, cyrenaica, as, he, advanced, his, army, was, joined, by, islamized, luwata, berbers, and, their, combined, forces, conquered, ghadamis, gafsa, and, the, jarid, in, the, last, region, he, established, a, permanent, arab, garrison, town, called, kairouan, at, a, relatively, safe, distance, from, carthage, and, the, coastal, areas, which, had, remained, under, byzantine, control, to, serve, as, a, base, for, further, expeditions, it, also, aided, muslim, conversion, efforts, among, the, berber, tribes, that, dominated, the, surrounding, countryside, mu, awiya, dismissed, uqba, in, 673, probably, out, of, concern, that, he, would, form, an, independent, power, base, in, the, lucrative, regions, that, he, had, conquered, the, new, arab, province, ifriqiya, modern, day, tunisia, remained, subordinate, to, the, governor, of, egypt, who, sent, his, mawla, non, arab, muslim, freedman, abu, al, muhajir, dinar, to, replace, uqba, who, was, arrested, and, transferred, to, mu, awiya, s, custody, in, damascus, abu, al, muhajir, continued, the, westward, campaigns, as, far, as, tlemcen, and, defeated, the, awraba, berber, chief, kasila, who, subsequently, embraced, islam, and, joined, his, forces, in, 678, a, treaty, between, the, arabs, and, the, byzantines, ceded, byzacena, to, the, caliphate, while, forcing, the, arabs, to, withdraw, from, the, northern, parts, of, the, province, after, mu, awiya, s, death, his, successor, yazid, reappointed, uqba, kasila, defected, and, a, byzantine, berber, alliance, ended, arab, control, over, ifriqiya, which, was, not, reestablished, until, the, reign, of, caliph, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, r, 685, 705, in, a, move, unprecedented, in, islamic, politics, mu, awiya, nominated, his, own, son, yazid, as, his, successor, the, caliph, likely, held, ambitions, for, his, son, s, succession, over, a, considerable, period, in, 666, he, allegedly, had, his, governor, in, homs, abd, al, rahman, ibn, khalid, poisoned, to, remove, him, as, a, potential, rival, to, yazid, the, syrian, arabs, with, whom, abd, al, rahman, ibn, khalid, was, popular, had, viewed, the, governor, as, the, caliph, s, most, suitable, successor, by, dint, of, his, military, record, and, descent, from, khalid, ibn, al, walid, it, was, not, until, the, latter, half, of, his, reign, that, mu, awiya, publicly, declared, yazid, heir, apparent, though, the, early, muslim, sources, offer, divergent, details, about, the, timing, and, location, of, the, events, relating, to, the, decision, the, accounts, of, al, mada, ini, 752, 843, and, ibn, al, athir, 1160, 1232, agree, that, al, mughira, was, the, first, to, suggest, that, yazid, be, acknowledged, as, mu, awiya, s, successor, and, that, ziyad, supported, the, nomination, with, the, caveat, that, yazid, abandon, impious, activities, which, could, arouse, opposition, from, the, muslim, polity, according, to, al, tabari, mu, awiya, publicly, announced, his, decision, in, 675, or, 676, and, demanded, oaths, of, allegiance, be, given, to, yazid, ibn, al, athir, alone, relates, that, delegations, from, all, the, provinces, were, summoned, to, damascus, where, mu, awiya, lectured, them, on, his, rights, as, ruler, their, duties, as, subjects, and, yazid, s, worthy, qualities, which, was, followed, by, the, calls, of, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, and, other, courtiers, that, yazid, be, recognized, as, the, caliph, s, successor, the, delegates, lent, their, support, with, the, exception, of, the, senior, basran, nobleman, al, ahnaf, ibn, qays, who, was, ultimately, bribed, into, compliance, al, mas, udi, 896, 956, and, al, tabari, do, not, mention, provincial, delegations, other, than, a, basran, embassy, led, by, ubayd, allah, ibn, ziyad, in, 678, 679, or, 679, 680, respectively, which, recognized, yazid, according, to, hinds, in, addition, to, yazid, s, nobility, age, and, sound, judgement, most, important, of, all, was, his, connection, to, the, kalb, the, kalb, led, quda, a, confederation, was, the, foundation, of, sufyanid, rule, and, yazid, s, succession, signaled, the, continuation, of, this, alliance, in, nominating, yazid, the, son, of, the, kalbite, maysun, mu, awiya, bypassed, his, older, son, abd, allah, from, his, qurayshite, wife, fakhita, although, support, from, the, kalb, and, the, quda, a, was, guaranteed, mu, awiya, exhorted, yazid, to, widen, his, tribal, support, base, in, syria, as, the, qaysites, were, the, predominant, element, in, the, northern, frontier, armies, mu, awiya, s, appointment, of, yazid, to, lead, the, war, efforts, with, byzantium, may, have, served, to, foster, qaysite, support, for, his, nomination, mu, awiya, s, efforts, to, that, end, were, not, entirely, successful, as, reflected, in, a, line, by, a, qaysite, poet, we, will, never, pay, allegiance, to, the, son, of, a, kalbi, woman, in, medina, mu, awiya, s, distant, kinsmen, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, sa, id, ibn, al, as, and, ibn, amir, accepted, mu, awiya, s, succession, order, albeit, disapprovingly, most, opponents, of, mu, awiya, s, order, in, iraq, and, among, the, umayyads, and, quraysh, of, the, hejaz, were, ultimately, threatened, or, bribed, into, acceptance, the, remaining, principle, opposition, emanated, from, husayn, ibn, ali, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, abd, allah, ibn, umar, and, abd, al, rahman, ibn, abi, bakr, all, prominent, medina, based, sons, of, earlier, caliphs, or, close, companions, of, muhammad, as, they, possessed, the, nearest, claims, to, the, caliphate, mu, awiya, was, determined, to, obtain, their, recognition, according, to, the, historian, awana, ibn, al, hakam, d, 764, before, his, death, mu, awiya, ordered, certain, measures, to, be, taken, against, them, entrusting, these, tasks, to, his, loyalists, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, and, muslim, ibn, uqba, mu, awiya, died, from, an, illness, in, damascus, in, rajab, 60, ah, april, or, may, 680, ce, at, around, the, age, of, 80, the, medieval, accounts, vary, regarding, the, specific, date, of, his, death, with, hisham, ibn, al, kalbi, d, 819, placing, it, on, 7, april, al, waqidi, on, 21, april, and, al, mada, ini, on, 29, april, yazid, who, was, away, from, damascus, at, the, time, of, his, father, s, death, is, held, by, abu, mikhnaf, d, 774, to, have, succeeded, him, on, 7, april, while, the, nestorian, chronicler, elias, of, nisibis, d, 1046, says, it, occurred, on, 21, april, in, his, last, testament, mu, awiya, told, his, family, fear, god, almighty, and, great, for, god, praise, him, protects, whoever, fears, him, and, there, is, no, protector, for, one, who, does, not, fear, god, he, was, buried, next, to, the, bab, al, saghir, gate, of, the, city, and, the, funeral, prayers, were, led, by, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, who, mourned, mu, awiya, as, the, stick, of, the, arabs, and, the, blade, of, the, arabs, by, means, of, whom, god, almighty, and, great, cut, off, strife, whom, he, made, sovereign, over, mankind, by, means, of, whom, he, conquered, countries, but, now, he, has, died, mu, awiya, s, grave, was, a, visitation, site, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, al, mas, udi, holds, that, a, mausoleum, was, built, over, the, grave, and, was, open, to, visitors, on, mondays, and, thursdays, ibn, taghribirdi, asserts, that, ahmad, ibn, tulun, the, autonomous, 9th, century, ruler, of, egypt, and, syria, erected, a, structure, on, the, grave, in, 883, or, 884, and, employed, members, of, the, public, to, regularly, recite, the, qur, an, and, light, candles, around, the, tomb, like, uthman, mu, awiya, adopted, the, title, khalifat, allah, deputy, of, god, instead, of, khalifat, rasul, allah, deputy, of, the, messenger, of, god, the, title, used, by, the, other, caliphs, who, preceded, him, the, title, may, have, implied, political, as, well, as, religious, authority, and, divine, sanctioning, he, is, reported, by, al, baladhuri, to, have, said, the, earth, belongs, to, god, and, i, am, the, deputy, of, god, nevertheless, whatever, the, absolutist, connotations, the, title, may, have, had, mu, awiya, evidently, did, not, impose, this, religious, authority, instead, he, governed, indirectly, like, a, supra, tribal, chief, using, alliances, with, provincial, ashraf, his, personal, skills, persuasive, power, and, wit, apart, from, his, war, with, ali, he, did, not, deploy, his, syrian, troops, domestically, and, often, used, monetary, gifts, as, a, tool, to, avoid, conflict, in, julius, wellhausen, s, assessment, mu, awiya, was, an, accomplished, diplomat, allowing, matters, to, ripen, of, themselves, and, only, now, and, then, assisting, their, progress, he, further, states, that, mu, awiya, had, the, ability, to, identify, and, employ, the, most, talented, men, at, his, service, and, made, even, those, whom, he, distrusted, work, for, him, in, the, view, of, the, historian, patricia, crone, mu, awiya, s, successful, rule, was, facilitated, by, the, tribal, composition, of, syria, there, the, arabs, who, formed, his, support, base, were, distributed, throughout, the, countryside, and, were, dominated, by, a, single, confederation, the, quda, a, this, was, in, contrast, to, iraq, and, egypt, where, the, diverse, tribal, composition, of, the, garrison, towns, meant, that, the, government, had, no, cohesive, support, base, and, had, to, create, a, delicate, balance, between, the, opposing, tribal, groups, as, evidenced, by, the, disintegration, of, ali, s, iraqi, alliance, maintaining, this, balance, was, untenable, in, her, view, mu, awiya, s, taking, advantage, of, the, tribal, circumstances, in, syria, prevented, the, dissolution, of, the, caliphate, in, the, civil, war, in, the, words, of, the, orientalist, martin, hinds, the, success, of, mu, awiya, s, style, of, governance, is, attested, by, the, fact, that, he, managed, to, hold, his, kingdom, together, without, ever, having, to, resort, to, using, his, syrian, troops, in, the, long, term, mu, awiya, s, system, proved, precarious, and, unviable, reliance, on, personal, relations, meant, his, government, was, dependent, on, paying, and, pleasing, its, agents, instead, of, commanding, them, this, created, a, system, of, indulgence, according, to, crone, the, governors, became, increasingly, unaccountable, and, amassed, personal, wealth, the, tribal, balance, on, which, he, relied, was, insecure, and, a, slight, fluctuation, would, lead, to, factionalism, and, infighting, when, yazid, became, caliph, he, continued, his, father, s, model, controversial, as, his, nomination, had, been, he, had, to, face, the, rebellions, of, husayn, and, ibn, al, zubayr, although, he, was, able, to, defeat, them, with, the, help, of, his, governors, and, the, syrian, army, the, system, fractured, as, soon, as, he, died, in, november, 683, the, provincial, ashraf, defected, to, ibn, al, zubayr, as, did, the, qaysite, tribes, who, had, migrated, to, syria, during, mu, awiya, s, reign, and, were, opposed, to, the, quda, a, confederation, on, whom, sufyanid, power, rested, in, a, matter, of, months, the, authority, of, yazid, s, successor, mu, awiya, ii, was, restricted, to, damascus, and, its, environs, although, the, umayyads, backed, by, the, quda, a, were, able, to, reconquer, the, caliphate, after, the, decade, long, second, civil, war, it, was, under, the, leadership, of, marwan, founder, of, the, new, ruling, umayyad, house, the, marwanids, and, his, son, abd, al, malik, having, realized, the, weakness, of, mu, awiya, s, model, and, lacking, in, his, political, skill, the, marwanids, abandoned, his, system, in, favor, of, a, more, traditional, form, of, governance, where, the, caliph, was, the, central, authority, nonetheless, the, hereditary, succession, introduced, by, mu, awiya, became, a, permanent, feature, of, many, of, the, muslim, governments, that, followed, kennedy, views, the, preservation, of, the, caliphate, s, unity, as, mu, awiya, s, greatest, achievement, expressing, a, similar, viewpoint, mu, awiya, s, biographer, r, stephen, humphreys, states, that, although, maintaining, the, integrity, of, the, caliphate, would, have, been, an, achievement, on, its, own, mu, awiya, was, intent, on, vigorously, continuing, the, conquests, that, had, been, initiated, by, abu, bakr, and, umar, by, creating, a, formidable, navy, he, made, the, caliphate, the, dominant, force, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, the, aegean, control, of, northeastern, iran, was, secured, and, the, caliphate, s, frontier, was, expanded, in, north, africa, madelung, deems, mu, awiya, a, corruptor, of, the, caliphal, office, under, whom, the, precedence, in, islam, sabiqa, which, was, the, determining, factor, in, the, choice, of, earlier, caliphs, gave, way, to, the, might, of, the, sword, the, people, became, his, subjects, and, he, became, the, absolute, lord, over, their, life, and, death, he, strangled, the, communal, spirit, of, islam, and, used, the, religion, as, a, tool, of, social, control, exploitation, and, military, terrorization, mu, awiya, was, the, first, caliph, whose, name, appeared, on, coins, inscriptions, or, documents, of, the, nascent, islamic, empire, the, inscriptions, from, his, reign, lacked, any, explicit, reference, to, islam, or, muhammad, and, the, only, titles, that, appear, are, servant, of, god, and, commander, of, the, faithful, this, has, led, some, modern, historians, to, question, mu, awiya, s, commitment, to, islam, they, have, proposed, that, he, adhered, to, a, non, confessional, or, indeterminate, form, of, monotheism, or, may, have, been, a, christian, asserting, that, the, earliest, muslims, did, not, see, their, faith, as, different, from, other, monotheistic, faiths, these, historians, see, the, earlier, medina, based, caliphs, in, the, same, vein, but, no, public, proclamations, from, their, period, exist, on, the, other, hand, the, historian, robert, hoyland, notes, that, mu, awiya, gave, a, very, islamic, challenge, to, the, byzantine, emperor, constans, to, deny, jesus, and, turn, to, the, great, god, whom, i, worship, the, god, of, our, father, abraham, and, speculates, that, mu, awiya, s, tour, of, christian, sites, in, jerusalem, was, done, to, demonstrate, the, fact, that, he, and, not, the, byzantine, emperor, was, now, god, s, representative, on, earth, the, surviving, muslim, histories, originated, in, abbasid, era, iraq, the, compilers, the, narrators, from, whom, the, stories, were, collected, and, the, overall, public, sentiment, in, iraq, were, hostile, to, the, syria, based, umayyads, under, whom, syria, was, a, privileged, province, and, iraq, was, locally, perceived, as, a, syrian, colony, moreover, the, abbasids, having, overthrown, the, umayyads, in, 750, saw, them, as, illegitimate, rulers, and, further, tarnished, their, memory, to, enhance, their, own, legitimacy, abbasid, caliphs, like, al, saffah, al, ma, mun, and, al, mu, tadid, publicly, condemned, mu, awiya, and, other, umayyad, caliphs, as, such, the, muslim, historical, tradition, is, by, and, large, anti, umayyad, nonetheless, in, the, case, of, mu, awiya, it, portrays, him, in, a, relatively, balanced, manner, on, the, one, hand, it, portrays, him, as, a, successful, ruler, who, implemented, his, will, with, persuasion, instead, of, force, it, stresses, his, quality, of, hilm, which, in, his, case, meant, mildness, slowness, to, anger, subtlety, and, management, of, people, by, perceiving, their, needs, and, desires, the, historical, tradition, is, rife, with, anecdotes, of, his, political, acumen, and, self, control, in, one, such, anecdote, when, inquired, about, allowing, one, of, his, courtiers, to, address, him, with, arrogance, he, remarked, i, do, not, insert, myself, between, the, people, and, their, tongue, so, long, as, they, do, not, insert, themselves, between, us, and, our, sovereignty, the, tradition, presents, him, operating, in, the, way, of, a, traditional, tribal, sheikh, who, lacks, absolute, authority, summoning, delegations, wufud, of, tribal, chiefs, and, persuading, them, with, flattery, arguments, and, presents, this, is, exemplified, in, a, saying, attributed, to, him, i, never, use, my, voice, if, i, can, use, my, money, never, my, whip, if, i, can, use, my, voice, never, my, sword, if, i, can, use, my, whip, but, if, i, have, to, use, my, sword, i, will, on, the, other, hand, the, tradition, also, portrays, him, as, a, despot, who, perverted, the, caliphate, into, kingship, in, the, words, of, al, ya, qubi, d, 898, was, the, first, to, have, a, bodyguard, police, force, and, chamberlains, he, had, somebody, walk, in, front, of, him, with, a, spear, took, alms, out, of, the, stipends, and, sat, on, a, throne, with, the, people, below, him, he, used, forced, labour, for, his, building, projects, he, was, the, first, to, turn, this, matter, into, mere, kingship, al, baladhuri, calls, him, the, khosrow, of, the, arabs, kisra, al, arab, khosrow, was, used, by, the, arabs, as, a, reference, to, sasanian, persian, monarchs, in, general, who, the, arabs, associated, with, worldly, splendor, and, authoritarianism, as, opposed, to, the, humility, of, muhammad, mu, awiya, was, compared, to, these, monarchs, mainly, because, he, appointed, his, son, yazid, as, the, next, caliph, which, was, viewed, as, a, violation, of, the, islamic, principle, of, shura, and, an, introduction, of, dynastic, rule, on, par, with, the, byzantines, and, sasanians, the, civil, war, that, erupted, after, mu, awiya, s, death, is, asserted, to, have, been, the, direct, consequence, of, yazid, s, nomination, in, the, islamic, tradition, mu, awiya, and, the, umayyads, are, given, the, title, of, malik, king, instead, of, khalifa, caliph, though, the, succeeding, abbasids, are, recognized, as, caliphs, the, contemporary, non, muslim, sources, generally, present, a, benign, image, of, mu, awiya, the, greek, historian, theophanes, calls, him, a, protosymboulos, first, among, equals, according, to, kennedy, the, nestorian, christian, chronicler, john, bar, penkaye, writing, in, the, 690s, has, nothing, but, praise, for, the, first, umayyad, caliph, of, whose, reign, he, says, the, peace, throughout, the, world, was, such, that, we, have, never, heard, either, from, our, fathers, or, from, our, grandparents, or, seen, that, there, had, ever, been, any, like, it, in, contrast, to, the, four, earlier, caliphs, who, are, considered, as, models, of, piety, and, having, governed, with, justice, mu, awiya, is, not, recognized, as, a, rightly, guided, caliph, khalifa, rashid, by, the, sunnis, he, is, seen, as, transforming, the, caliphate, into, a, worldly, and, despotic, kingship, his, acquisition, of, the, caliphate, through, the, civil, war, and, his, institution, of, the, hereditary, succession, by, appointing, his, son, yazid, as, heir, apparent, are, the, principal, charges, made, against, him, although, uthman, and, ali, had, been, highly, controversial, during, the, early, period, religious, scholars, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, compromised, in, order, to, appease, and, absorb, the, uthmanid, and, pro, alid, factions, uthman, and, ali, were, thus, regarded, along, with, the, first, two, caliphs, as, divinely, guided, whereas, mu, awiya, and, those, who, came, after, him, were, viewed, as, oppressive, tyrants, nevertheless, the, sunnis, accord, him, the, status, of, a, companion, of, muhammad, and, consider, him, a, scribe, of, the, qur, anic, revelation, katib, al, wahi, on, these, accounts, he, is, also, respected, some, sunnis, defend, his, war, against, ali, holding, that, although, he, was, in, error, he, acted, according, to, his, best, judgment, and, had, no, evil, intentions, mu, awiya, s, war, with, ali, whom, the, shia, hold, as, the, true, successor, of, muhammad, has, made, him, a, reviled, figure, in, shia, islam, according, to, the, shia, based, on, this, alone, mu, awiya, qualifies, as, an, unbeliever, if, he, was, a, believer, to, begin, with, in, addition, he, is, held, responsible, for, the, killing, of, a, number, of, muhammad, s, companions, at, siffin, having, ordered, the, cursing, of, ali, from, the, pulpit, appointing, yazid, as, his, successor, who, went, on, to, kill, husayn, at, karbala, executing, the, pro, alid, kufan, nobleman, hujr, ibn, adi, and, assassinating, hasan, by, poisoning, as, such, he, has, been, a, particular, target, of, shia, traditions, some, traditions, hold, him, to, have, been, born, of, an, illegitimate, relationship, between, abu, sufyan, s, wife, hind, and, muhammad, s, uncle, abbas, his, conversion, to, islam, is, held, to, be, devoid, of, any, conviction, and, to, have, been, motivated, by, convenience, after, muhammad, conquered, mecca, on, this, basis, he, is, given, the, title, of, taliq, freed, slave, of, muhammad, a, number, of, hadiths, are, ascribed, to, muhammad, condemning, mu, awiya, and, his, father, abu, sufyan, in, which, he, is, called, an, accursed, man, la, in, son, of, an, accursed, man, and, prophesying, that, he, will, die, as, an, unbeliever, unlike, the, sunnis, the, shia, deny, him, the, status, of, a, companion, and, also, refute, the, sunni, claims, that, he, was, a, scribe, of, the, qur, anic, revelation, like, other, opponents, of, ali, mu, awiya, is, cursed, in, a, ritual, called, tabarra, which, is, held, by, many, shia, to, be, an, obligation, amid, rising, religious, sectarianism, among, muslims, in, the, 10th, century, while, the, abbasid, caliphate, was, dominated, by, the, twelver, shia, emirs, of, the, buyid, dynasty, the, figure, of, mu, awiya, became, a, propaganda, tool, used, by, the, shia, and, the, sunnis, opposed, to, them, strong, pro, mu, awiya, sentiments, were, voiced, by, sunnis, in, several, abbasid, cities, including, baghdad, wasit, raqqa, and, isfahan, at, about, the, same, time, the, shia, were, permitted, by, the, buyids, and, the, sunni, abbasid, caliphs, to, perform, the, ritual, cursing, of, mu, awiya, in, mosques, in, 10th, 11th, century, egypt, the, figure, of, mu, awiya, occasionally, played, a, similar, role, with, the, isma, ili, shia, fatimid, caliphs, introducing, measures, opposed, to, mu, awiya, s, memory, and, opponents, of, the, government, using, him, as, a, tool, to, berate, the, shia
