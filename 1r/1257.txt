slavery, in, ottoman, navy, on, galleys, as, an, oarsman, where, he, picked, up, a, knowledge, of, turkic, languages, while, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, as, to, his, return, to, ukraine, most, historians, believe, khmelnytsky, either, escaped, or, was, ransomed, sources, vary, as, to, his, benefactor, his, mother, friends, the, polish, king, but, perhaps, by, krzysztof, zbaraski, ambassador, of, the, commonwealth, to, the, ottomans, in, 1622, he, paid, 30, 000, thalers, in, ransom, for, all, prisoners, of, war, captured, at, the, battle, of, cecora, upon, return, to, subotiv,

because, some, of, the, elders, either, joined, pavlyuk, or, were, killed, by, him, like, former, military, clerk, teodor, onuszkowicz, because, of, his, new, position, khmelnytsky, was, the, one,

registered, cossacks, joined, the, rebels, while, some, of, them, remained, loyal, unlike, the, last, time, potocki, decided, not, to, punish, the, rebel, cossacks, but, forced, all, of, them, to, swear, loyalty, to, the, king, and, the, state, and, swear, not, to, seek, revenge, against, each, other, the, hetman, also, agreed, to, their, request, to, send, emissaries, to, the, king, to, seek,

the, dedication, he, described, the, meeting, de, br, gy, had, with, khmelnytsky, in, france, and, group, of, cossacks, he, brought, to, france, to, fight, against, spain, in, flanders, chevalier, also, claimed, that, he, himself, commanded, cossacks, in, flanders, although, in, distant, parts, of, the, book, chevalier, doesn, t, mention, either, cossacks, or, khmelnytsky, even, once, in, his, other, writing, relation, des, cosaques, avec, la, vie, de, kmielniski, tir, e, d, un, manuscrit, published, the, same, year, which, also, contains, a, biography, of, khmelnytsky, there, is, no, mention, about, his, or, any, other, cossacks, stay, in, france, or, flanders, moreover, first, chevalier, book, is, the, only, source, that, mention, such, an, event, there, is, not, trace, of, it, even, in, correspondence, of, count, de, br, gy, although, it, is, true, that, he, was, conducting, a, recruitment, of, soldiers, in, poland, for, french, army, in, years, 1646, 1648, in, fact, he, succeeded, and, about, 3000, of, them, travelled, via, gda, sk, to, flanders, and, took, part, in, fights, around, dunkirk, french, sources, describes, them, as, infanterie, tout, poulonnois, qu,

de, dunkerque, when, describing, participation, of, polish, mercenaries, in, fights, over, dunkirk, notes, that, they, were, commanded, by, some, sirot, some, historians, identify, him, as, ivan, sirko, cossack, ataman, claims, that, khmelnytsky, and, cossacks, were, actually, in, france, are, supported, by, some, ukrainian, historians, while, other, and, most, polish, scholarship, finds, it, unlikely, upon, the, death, of, magnate, stanis, aw, koniecpolski, march, 1646, his, successor, aleksander, redrew, the, maps, of, his, possessions, he, laid, claim, to, khmelnytsky, s, estate, claiming, it, as, his, trying, to, find, protection, from, this, grab, by, the, powerful, magnate, khmelnytsky, wrote, numerous, appeals, and, letters, to, different, representatives, of, the, polish, crown, but, to, no, avail, at, the, end, of, 1645, the, chyhyryn, starosta, daniel, czapli, ski, officially, received, authority, from, koniecpolski, to, seize, khmelnytsky, s, subotiv, estate, in, the, summer, of, 1646, khmelnytsky, arranged, an, audience, with, king, w, adys, aw, iv, to, plead, his, case, as, he, had, favourable, standing, at, the, court, w, adys, aw, who, wanted, cossacks, on, his, side, in, the, wars, he, planned, gave, khmelnytsky, a, royal, charter, protecting, his, rights, to, the, subotiv, estate, but, because, of, the, structure, of, the, commonwealth, at, that, time, and, the, lawlessness, of, ukraine, even, the, king, was, not, able, to, prevent, a, confrontation, with, local, magnates, in, the, beginning, of, 1647, daniel, czapli, ski, started, to, harass, khmelnytsky, in, order, to, force, him, off, the, land, on, two, occasions, the, magnate, had, subotiv, raided, considerable, property, damage, was, done, and, khmelnytsky, s, son, yuriy, was, badly, beaten, finally, in, april, 1647, czapli, ski, succeeded, in, evicting, khmelnytsky, from, the, land, and, he, was, forced, to, move, with, his, large, family, to, a, relative, s, house, in, chyhyryn, in, may, 1647, khmelnytsky, arranged, a, second, audience, with, the, king, to, plead, his, case, but, found, him, unwilling, to, confront, a, powerful, magnate, in, addition, to, losing, the, estate, khmelnytsky, suffered, the, loss, of, his, wife, hanna, and, he, was, left, alone, with, their, children, he, promptly, remarried, to, motrona, helena, czapli, ska, by, that, time, wife, of, daniel, czapli, ski, the, so, called, helen, of, the, steppe, he, was, less, successful, in, real, estate, and, was, unable, to, regain, the, land, and, property, of, his, estate, or, financial, compensation, for, it, during, this, time, he, met, several, higher, polish, officials, to, discuss, the, cossacks, war, with, the, tatars, and, used, this, occasion, again, to, plead, his, case, with, czapli, ski, still, unsuccessfully, while, khmelnytsky, found, no, support, from, the, polish, officials, he, found, it, in, his, cossack, friends, and, subordinates, his, chyhyryn, regiment, and, others, were, on, his, side, all, through, the, autumn, of, 1647, khmelnytsky, travelled, from, one, regiment, to, another, and, had, numerous, consultations, with, cossack, leaders, throughout, ukraine, his, activity, raised, suspicion, among, the, local, polish, authorities, already, used, to, cossack, revolts, he, was, promptly, arrested, koniecpolski, issued, an, order, for, his, execution, but, the, chyhyryn, cossack, polkovnyk, who, held, khmelnytsky, was, persuaded, to, release, him, not, willing, to, tempt, fate, any, further, khmelnytsky, headed, for, the, zaporozhian, sich, with, a, group, of, his, supporters, while, the, czapli, ski, affair, is, generally, regarded, as, the, immediate, cause, of, the, uprising, it, was, primarily, a, catalyst, for, actions, representing, rising, popular, discontent, religion, ethnicity, and, economics, factored, into, this, discontent, while, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, remained, a, union, of, nations, a, sizable, population, of, orthodox, ruthenians, were, ignored, oppressed, by, the, polish, magnates, they, took, their, wrath, out, on, poles, as, well, as, the, jews, who, often, managed, the, estates, of, polish, nobles, the, advent, of, the, counter, reformation, worsened, relations, between, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, many, orthodox, ukrainians, considered, the, union, of, brest, as, a, threat, to, their, orthodox, faith, at, the, end, of, 1647, khmelnytsky, reached, the, estuary, of, the, dnieper, river, on, 7, december, his, small, detachment, 300, 500, men, with, the, help, of, registered, cossacks, who, went, over, to, his, side, disarmed, the, small, polish, detachment, guarding, the, area, and, took, over, the, zaporozhian, sich, the, poles, attempted, to, retake, the, sich, but, were, decisively, defeated, as, more, registered, cossacks, joined, the, forces, at, the, end, of, january, 1648, a, cossack, rada, was, called, and, khmelnytsky, was, unanimously, elected, a, hetman, a, period, of, feverish, activity, followed, cossacks, were, sent, with, hetman, s, letters, to, many, regions, of, ukraine, calling, on, cossacks, and, orthodox, peasants, to, join, the, rebellion, khortytsia, was, fortified, efforts, were, made, to, acquire, and, make, weapons, and, ammunition, and, emissaries, were, sent, to, the, khan, of, crimea, sl, m, iii, giray, initially, polish, authorities, took, the, news, of, khmelnytsky, s, arrival, at, the, sich, and, reports, about, the, rebellion, lightly, the, two, sides, exchanged, lists, of, demands, the, poles, asked, the, cossacks, to, surrender, the, mutinous, leader, and, disband, while, khmelnytsky, and, the, rada, demanded, that, the, commonwealth, restore, the, cossacks, ancient, rights, stop, the, advance, of, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, yield, the, right, to, appoint, orthodox, leaders, of, the, sich, and, of, the, registered, cossack, regiments, and, to, remove, commonwealth, troops, from, ukraine, the, polish, magnates, considered, the, demands, an, affront, and, an, army, headed, by, stefan, potocki, moved, in, the, direction, of, the, sich, had, the, cossacks, stayed, at, khortytsia, they, might, have, been, defeated, as, in, many, other, rebellions, however, khmelnytsky, marched, against, the, poles, the, two, armies, met, on, 16, may, 1648, at, zhovti, vody, where, aided, by, the, tatars, of, tugay, bey, the, cossacks, inflicted, their, first, crushing, defeat, on, the, commonwealth, it, was, repeated, soon, afterwards, with, the, same, success, at, the, battle, of, korsu, on, 26, may, 1648, khmelnytsky, used, his, diplomatic, and, military, skills, under, his, leadership, the, cossack, army, moved, to, battle, positions, following, his, plans, cossacks, were, proactive, and, decisive, in, their, manoeuvrers, and, attacks, and, most, importantly, he, gained, the, support, of, both, large, contingents, of, registered, cossacks, and, the, crimean, khan, his, crucial, ally, for, the, many, battles, to, come, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, paiseus, who, was, visiting, kiev, at, this, time, referred, to, khmelnytsky, as, the, prince, of, rus, in, february, 1649, during, negotiations, in, pereiaslav, with, a, polish, delegation, headed, by, senator, adam, kysil, khmelnytsky, declared, that, he, was, the, sole, autocrat, of, rus, and, that, he, had, enough, power, in, ukraine, podilia, and, volhynia, in, his, land, and, principality, stretching, as, far, as, lviv, kholm, modern, che, m, and, halych, i, already, did, more, than, was, thinking, before, now, i, will, obtain, what, i, revised, recently, i, will, liberate, out, of, the, polish, woe, all, of, the, ruthenian, people, before, i, was, fighting, for, the, insults, and, injustice, caused, to, me, now, i, will, fight, for, our, orthodox, faith, and, all, people, will, help, me, in, that, all, the, way, to, lublin, and, krakow, and, i, won, t, back, off, from, the, people, as, they, are, our, right, hand, and, for, the, purpose, lest, you, won, t, attack, cossacks, by, conquering, peasants, i, will, have, two, three, hundred, thousands, of, them, after, the, period, of, initial, military, successes, the, state, building, process, began, his, leadership, was, demonstrated, in, all, areas, of, state, building, military, administration, finance, economics, and, culture, khmelnytsky, made, the, zaporozhian, host, the, supreme, power, in, the, new, ukrainian, state, and, unified, all, the, spheres, of, ukrainian, society, under, his, authority, khmelnytsky, built, a, new, government, system, and, developed, military, and, civilian, administration, a, new, generation, of, statesmen, and, military, leaders, came, to, the, forefront, ivan, vyhovsky, pavlo, teteria, danylo, nechai, and, ivan, nechai, ivan, bohun, hryhoriy, hulyanytsky, from, cossack, polkovnyks, officers, and, military, commanders, a, new, elite, within, the, cossack, hetman, state, was, born, throughout, the, years, the, elite, preserved, and, maintained, the, autonomy, of, the, cossack, hetmanate, in, the, face, of, russia, s, attempt, to, curb, it, it, was, also, instrumental, in, the, onset, of, the, period, of, ruin, that, followed, eventually, destroying, most, of, the, achievements, of, the, khmelnytsky, era, khmelnytsky, s, initial, successes, were, followed, by, a, series, of, setbacks, as, neither, khmelnytsky, nor, the, commonwealth, had, enough, strength, to, stabilise, the, situation, or, to, inflict, a, defeat, on, the, enemy, what, followed, was, a, period, of, intermittent, warfare, and, several, peace, treaties, which, were, seldom, upheld, from, spring, 1649, onward, the, situation, turned, for, the, worse, for, the, cossacks, as, polish, attacks, increased, in, frequency, they, became, more, successful, the, resulting, treaty, of, zboriv, on, 18, august, 1649, was, unfavourable, for, the, cossacks, it, was, followed, by, another, defeat, at, the, battle, of, berestechko, on, 18, june, 1651, in, which, the, tatars, betrayed, khmelnytsky, and, held, the, hetman, captive, the, cossacks, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, with, an, estimated, 30, 000, casualties, they, were, forced, to, sign, the, treaty, of, bila, tserkva, which, favoured, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, warfare, broke, open, again, and, in, the, years, that, followed, the, two, sides, were, almost, perpetually, at, war, now, the, crimean, tatars, played, a, decisive, role, and, did, not, allow, either, side, to, prevail, it, was, in, their, interests, to, keep, both, ukraine, and, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, from, getting, too, strong, and, becoming, an, effective, power, in, the, region, khmelnytsky, started, looking, for, another, foreign, ally, although, the, cossacks, had, established, their, de, facto, independence, from, poland, the, new, state, needed, legitimacy, which, could, be, provided, by, a, foreign, monarch, in, search, of, a, protectorate, khmelnytsky, approached, the, ottoman, sultan, in, 1651, and, formal, embassies, were, exchanged, the, turks, offered, vassalship, like, their, other, arrangements, with, contemporary, crimea, moldavia, and, wallachia, however, the, idea, of, a, union, with, the, muslim, monarch, was, not, acceptable, to, the, general, populace, and, most, cossacks, the, other, possible, ally, was, the, tsardom, of, russia, however, despite, appeals, for, help, from, khmelnytsky, in, the, name, of, the, shared, orthodox, faith, the, tsar, preferred, to, wait, until, the, threat, of, a, cossack, ottoman, union, in, 1653, finally, forced, him, to, action, the, idea, that, the, tsar, might, be, favourable, to, taking, ukraine, under, his, hand, was, communicated, to, the, hetman, and, so, diplomatic, activity, intensified, after, a, series, of, negotiations, it, was, agreed, that, the, cossacks, would, accept, overlordship, by, the, tsar, alexei, mikhailovich, to, finalize, the, treaty, a, russian, embassy, led, by, boyar, vasily, buturlin, came, to, pereiaslav, where, on, 18, january, 1654, the, cossack, rada, was, called, and, the, treaty, concluded, historians, have, not, come, to, consensus, in, interpreting, the, intentions, of, the, tsar, and, khmelnytsky, in, signing, this, agreement, the, treaty, legitimized, russian, claims, to, the, capital, of, kievan, rus, and, strengthened, the, tsar, s, influence, in, the, region, khmelnytsky, needed, the, treaty, to, gain, a, legitimate, monarch, s, protection, and, support, from, a, friendly, orthodox, power, historians, have, differed, in, their, reading, of, khmelnytsky, s, goal, with, the, union, whether, it, was, to, be, a, military, union, a, suzerainty, or, a, complete, incorporation, of, ukraine, into, the, tsardom, of, russia, the, differences, were, expressed, during, the, ceremony, of, the, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, tsar, the, russian, envoy, refused, to, reciprocate, with, an, oath, from, the, ruler, to, his, subjects, as, the, cossacks, and, ruthenians, expected, since, it, was, the, custom, of, the, polish, king, khmelnytsky, stormed, out, of, the, church, and, threatened, to, cancel, the, entire, treaty, the, cossacks, decided, to, rescind, the, demand, and, abide, by, the, treaty, as, a, result, of, the, 1654, treaty, of, pereiaslav, the, geopolitical, map, of, the, region, changed, russia, entered, the, scene, and, the, cossacks, former, allies, the, tatars, had, switched, sides, and, gone, over, to, the, polish, side, initiating, warfare, against, khmelnytsky,

1656, while, its, forces, were, deeply, involved, in, poland, that, war, ended, in, status, quo, two, years, later, but, it, complicated, matters, for, khmelnytsky, as, his, ally, was, now, fighting, his, overlord, in, addition, to, diplomatic, tensions, between, the, tsar, and, khmelnytsky, a, number, of, other, disagreements, between, the, two, surfaced, in, particular, they, concerned, russian,

compared, the, swedes, to, the, tsar, and, said, that, the, former, were, more, honourable, and, trustworthy, than, the, russians, in, poland, the, cossack, army, and, transylvanian, allies, suffered, a, number, of, setbacks, as, a, result, khmelnytsky, had, to, deal, with, a, cossack, rebellion, on, the, home, front, troubling, news, also, came, from, crimea, as, tatars, in, alliance, with, poland, were, preparing, for, a, new, invasion, of, ukraine, though, already, ill, khmelnytsky, continued, to, conduct, diplomatic, activity, at, one, point, even, receiving, the, tsar, s, envoys, from, his, bed, on, 22, july, he, suffered, a, cerebral, hemorrhage, and, became, paralysed, after, his, audience, with, the, kiev, colonel, zhdanovich, his, expedition, to, halychyna, had, failed,

from, his, capital, chyhyryn, to, his, estate, at, subotiv, for, burial, in, his, ancestral, church, in, 1664, a, polish, hetman, stefan, czarniecki, recaptured, subotiv, which, according, to, some, ukrainian, historians, ordered, the, bodies, of, the, hetman, and, his, son, tymish, to, be, exhumed, and, desecrated, while, others, claim, that, is, not, the, case, khmelnytsky, had, a, crucial, influence, on, the, history, of, ukraine, he, not, only, shaped, the, future, of, ukraine, but, affected, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, as, the, weakening, of, poland, lithuania, was, exploited, by, austria, saxony, prussia, and, russia, his, actions, and, role, in, events, were, viewed, differently, by, different, contemporaries, and, even, now, there, are, greatly, differing, perspectives, on, his, legacy, in, ukraine, khmelnytsky, is, generally, regarded, as, a, national, hero, a, city, and, a, region, of, the, country, bear, his, name, his, image, is, prominently, displayed, on, ukrainian, banknotes, and, his, monument, in, the, centre, of, kyiv, is, a, focal, point, of, the, ukrainian, capital, there, have, also, been, several, issues, of, the, order, of, bohdan, khmelnytsky, one, of, the, highest, decorations, in, ukraine, and, in, the, former, soviet, union, however, with, all, this, positive, appreciation, of, his, legacy, even, in, ukraine, it, is, far, from, being, unanimous, he, is, criticised, for, his, union, with, russia, which, in, the, view, of, some, proved, to, be, disastrous, for, the, future, of, the, country, prominent, ukrainian, poet, taras, shevchenko, was, one, of, khmelnytsky, s, very, vocal, and, harsh, critics, others, criticize, him, for, his, alliance, with, the, crimean, tatars, which, permitted, the, latter, to, take, a, large, number, of, ukrainian, peasants, as, slaves, as, the, cossacks, as, a, military, caste, did, not, protect, the, kholopy, the, lowest, stratum, of, the, ukrainian, people, folk, songs, capture, this, on, the, balance, the, view, of, his, legacy, in, present, day, ukraine, is, more, positive, than, negative, with, some, critics, acknowledging, that, the, union, with, russia, was, dictated, by, necessity, and, an, attempt, to, survive, in, those, difficult, times, in, a, 2018, ukraine, s, rating, sociological, group, poll, 73, of, ukrainian, respondents, had, a, positive, attitude, to, khmelnytsky, khmelnytsky, s, role, in, the, history, of, the, polish, state, has, been, viewed, mostly, in, a, negative, light, the, rebellion, of, 1648, proved, to, be, the, end, of, the, golden, age, of, the, commonwealth, and, the, beginning, of, its, demise, although, it, survived, the, rebellion, and, the, following, war, within, a, hundred, years, it, was, divided, amongst, russia, prussia, and, austria, in, the, partitions, of, poland, many, poles, blamed, khmelnytsky, for, the, decline, of, the, commonwealth, khmelnytsky, has, been, a, subject, to, several, works, of, fiction, in, the, 19th, century, polish, literature, but, the, most, notable, treatment, of, him, in, polish, literature, is, found, in, henryk, sienkiewicz, s, with, fire, and, sword, the, rather, critical, portrayal, of, him, by, sienkiewicz, has, been, moderated, in, the, 1999, movie, adaptation, by, jerzy, hoffman, the, official, russian, historiography, stressed, the, fact, that, khmelnytsky, entered, into, union, with, moscow, s, tsar, alexei, mikhailovich, with, an, expressed, desire, to, re, unify, ukraine, with, russia, this, view, corresponded, with, the, official, theory, of, moscow, as, an, heir, of, the, kievan, rus, which, appropriately, gathered, its, former, territories, khmelnytsky, was, viewed, as, a, national, hero, of, russia, for, bringing, ukraine, into, the, eternal, union, of, all, the, russias, great, russia, little, ukraine, and, white, belarus, russia, as, such, he, was, much, respected, and, venerated, during, the, existence, of, the, russian, empire, his, role, was, presented, as, a, model, for, all, ukrainians, to, follow, to, aspire, for, closer, ties, with, great, russia, this, view, was, expressed, in, a, monument, commissioned, by, the, russian, nationalist, mikhail, yuzefovich, which, was, installed, in, the, centre, of, kiev, in, 1888, russian, authorities, decided, the, original, version, of, the, monument, created, by, russian, sculptor, mikhail, mikeshin, was, too, xenophobic, it, was, to, depict, a, vanquished, pole, jew, and, a, catholic, priest, under, the, hooves, of, the, horse, the, inscription, on, the, monument, reads, to, bohdan, khmelnytsky, from, one, and, indivisible, russia, mikeshin, also, created, the, monument, to, the, millennium, of, russia, in, novgorod, which, has, khmelnytsky, shown, as, one, of, russia, s, prominent, figures, soviet, historiography, followed, in, many, ways, the, imperial, russian, theory, of, re, unification, while, adding, the, class, struggle, dimension, to, the, story, khmelnytsky, was, praised, not, only, for, re, unifying, ukraine, with, russia, but, also, for, organizing, the, class, struggle, of, oppressed, ukrainian, peasants, against, polish, exploiters, the, assessment, of, khmelnytsky, in, jewish, history, is, overwhelmingly, negative, because, he, used, jews, as, scapegoats, and, sought, to, eradicate, jews, from, ukraine, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, led, to, the, deaths, of, an, estimated, 18, 000, 100, 000, jews, atrocity, stories, about, massacre, victims, who, had, been, buried, alive, cut, to, pieces, or, forced, to, kill, one, another, spread, throughout, europe, and, beyond, the, pogroms, contributed, to, a, revival, of, the, ideas, of, isaac, luria, who, revered, the, kabbalah, and, the, identification, of, sabbatai, zevi, as, the, messiah, orest, subtelny, writes, between, 1648, and, 1656, tens, of, thousands, of, jews, given, the, lack, of, reliable, data, it, is, impossible, to, establish, more, accurate, figures, were, killed, by, the, rebels, and, to, this, day, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, is, considered, by, jews, to, be, one, of, the, most, traumatic, events, in, their, history, bohdan, khmelnytsky
