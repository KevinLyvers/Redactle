francis, bacon, 1st, viscount, st, alban, 1st, lord, verulam, pc, b, e, k, n, 22, january, 1561, 9, april, 1626, was, an, english, philosopher, and, statesman, who, served, as, attorney, general, and, lord, chancellor, of, england, under, king, james, i, bacon, argued, the, importance, of, natural, philosophy, guided, by, scientific, method, and, his, works, remained, influential, throughout, the, scientific, revolution, bacon, has, been, called, the, father, of, empiricism, he, argued, for, the, possibility, of, scientific, knowledge, based, only, upon, inductive, reasoning, and, careful, observation, of, events, in, nature, he, believed, that, science, could, be, achieved, by, the, use, of, a, sceptical, and, methodical, approach, whereby, scientists, aim, to, avoid, misleading, themselves, although, his, most, specific, proposals, about, such, a, method, the, baconian, method, did, not, have, long, lasting, influence, the, general, idea, of, the, importance, and, possibility, of, a, sceptical, methodology, makes, bacon, one, of, the, later, founders, of, the, scientific, method, his, portion, of, the, method, based, in, scepticism, was, a, new, rhetorical, and, theoretical, framework, for, science, whose, practical, details, are, still, central, to, debates, on, science, and, methodology, he, is, famous, for, his, role, in, the, scientific, revolution, promoting, scientific, experimentation, as, a, way, of, glorifying, god, and, fulfilling, scripture, bacon, was, a, patron, of, libraries, and, developed, a, system, for, cataloguing, books, under, three, categories, history, poetry, and, philosophy, which, could, further, be, divided, into, specific, subjects, and, subheadings, about, books, he, wrote, some, books, are, to, be, tasted, others, swallowed, and, some, few, to, be, chewed, and, digested, the, shakespearean, authorship, thesis, a, fringe, theory, which, was, first, proposed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, contends, that, bacon, wrote, at, least, some, and, possibly, all, of, the, plays, conventionally, attributed, to, william, shakespeare, bacon, was, educated, at, trinity, college, at, the, university, of, cambridge, where, he, rigorously, followed, the, medieval, curriculum, which, was, presented, largely, in, latin, he, was, the, first, recipient, of, the, queen, s, counsel, designation, conferred, in, 1597, when, elizabeth, i, reserved, him, as, her, legal, advisor, after, the, accession, of, james, i, in, 1603, bacon, was, knighted, then, created, baron, verulam, in, 1618, and, viscount, st, alban, in, 1621, he, had, no, heirs, and, so, both, titles, became, extinct, on, his, death, of, pneumonia, in, 1626, at, the, age, of, 65, he, is, buried, at, st, michael, s, church, st, albans, hertfordshire, francis, bacon, was, born, on, 22, january, 1561, at, york, house, near, strand, in, london, the, son, of, sir, nicholas, bacon, lord, keeper, of, the, great, seal, by, his, second, wife, anne, cooke, bacon, the, daughter, of, the, noted, renaissance, humanist, anthony, cooke, his, mother, s, sister, was, married, to, william, cecil, 1st, baron, burghley, making, burghley, bacon, s, uncle, biographers, believe, that, bacon, was, educated, at, home, in, his, early, years, owing, to, poor, health, which, would, plague, him, throughout, his, life, he, received, tuition, from, john, walsall, a, graduate, of, oxford, with, a, strong, leaning, toward, puritanism, he, attended, trinity, college, at, the, university, of, cambridge, on, 5, april, 1573, at, the, age, of, 12, living, there, for, three, years, along, with, his, older, brother, anthony, bacon, 1558, 1601, under, the, personal, tutelage, of, john, whitgift, future, archbishop, of, canterbury, bacon, s, education, was, conducted, largely, in, latin, and, followed, the, medieval, curriculum, it, was, at, cambridge, that, bacon, first, met, queen, elizabeth, who, was, impressed, by, his, precocious, intellect, and, was, accustomed, to, calling, him, the, young, lord, keeper, his, studies, brought, him, to, the, belief, that, the, methods, and, results, of, science, as, then, practised, were, erroneous, his, reverence, for, aristotle, conflicted, with, his, rejection, of, aristotelian, philosophy, which, seemed, to, him, barren, argumentative, and, wrong, in, its, objectives, on, 27, june, 1576, he, and, anthony, entered, de, societate, magistrorum, at, gray, s, inn, a, few, months, later, francis, went, abroad, with, sir, amias, paulet, the, english, ambassador, at, paris, while, anthony, continued, his, studies, at, home, the, state, of, government, and, society, in, france, under, henry, iii, afforded, him, valuable, political, instruction, for, the, next, three, years, he, visited, blois, poitiers, tours, italy, and, spain, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, studied, at, the, university, of, poitiers, during, his, travels, bacon, studied, language, statecraft, and, civil, law, while, performing, routine, diplomatic, tasks, on, at, least, one, occasion, he, delivered, diplomatic, letters, to, england, for, walsingham, burghley, leicester, and, for, the, queen, the, sudden, death, of, his, father, in, february, 1579, prompted, bacon, to, return, to, england, sir, nicholas, had, laid, up, a, considerable, sum, of, money, to, purchase, an, estate, for, his, youngest, son, but, he, died, before, doing, so, and, francis, was, left, with, only, a, fifth, of, that, money, having, borrowed, money, bacon, got, into, debt, to, support, himself, he, took, up, his, residence, in, law, at, gray, s, inn, in, 1579, his, income, being, supplemented, by, a, grant, from, his, mother, lady, anne, of, the, manor, of, marks, near, romford, in, essex, which, generated, a, rent, of, 46, bacon, stated, that, he, had, three, goals, to, uncover, truth, to, serve, his, country, and, to, serve, his, church, he, sought, to, achieve, these, goals, by, seeking, a, prestigious, post, in, 1580, through, his, uncle, lord, burghley, he, applied, for, a, post, at, court, that, might, enable, him, to, pursue, a, life, of, learning, but, his, application, failed, for, two, years, he, worked, quietly, at, gray, s, inn, until, he, was, admitted, as, an, outer, barrister, in, 1582, his, parliamentary, career, began, when, he, was, elected, mp, for, bossiney, cornwall, in, a, by, election, in, 1581, in, 1584, he, took, his, seat, in, parliament, for, melcombe, in, dorset, and, in, 1586, for, taunton, at, this, time, he, began, to, write, on, the, condition, of, parties, in, the, church, as, well, as, on, the, topic, of, philosophical, reform, in, the, lost, tract, temporis, partus, maximus, yet, he, failed, to, gain, a, position, that, he, thought, would, lead, him, to, success, he, showed, signs, of, sympathy, to, puritanism, attending, the, sermons, of, the, puritan, chaplain, of, gray, s, inn, and, accompanying, his, mother, to, the, temple, church, to, hear, walter, travers, this, led, to, the, publication, of, his, earliest, surviving, tract, which, criticized, the, english, church, s, suppression, of, the, puritan, clergy, in, the, parliament, of, 1586, he, openly, urged, execution, for, the, catholic, mary, queen, of, scots, about, this, time, he, again, approached, his, powerful, uncle, for, help, this, move, was, followed, by, his, rapid, progress, at, the, bar, he, became, a, bencher, in, 1586, and, was, elected, a, reader, in, 1587, delivering, his, first, set, of, lectures, in, lent, the, following, year, in, 1589, he, received, the, valuable, appointment, of, reversion, to, the, clerkship, of, the, star, chamber, although, he, did, not, formally, take, office, until, 1608, the, post, was, worth, 1, 600, a, year, in, 1588, he, became, mp, for, liverpool, and, then, for, middlesex, in, 1593, he, later, sat, three, times, for, ipswich, 1597, 1601, 1604, and, once, for, cambridge, university, 1614, he, became, known, as, a, liberal, minded, reformer, eager, to, amend, and, simplify, the, law, though, a, friend, of, the, crown, he, opposed, feudal, privileges, and, dictatorial, powers, he, spoke, against, religious, persecution, he, struck, at, the, house, of, lords, in, its, usurpation, of, the, money, bills, he, advocated, for, the, union, of, england, and, scotland, which, made, him, a, significant, influence, toward, the, consolidation, of, the, united, kingdom, and, he, later, would, advocate, for, the, integration, of, ireland, into, the, union, closer, constitutional, ties, he, believed, would, bring, greater, peace, and, strength, to, these, countries, bacon, soon, became, acquainted, with, robert, devereux, the, 2nd, earl, of, essex, queen, elizabeth, s, favourite, by, 1591, he, acted, as, the, earl, s, confidential, adviser, in, 1592, he, was, commissioned, to, write, a, tract, in, response, to, the, jesuit, robert, parson, s, anti, government, polemic, which, he, titled, certain, observations, made, upon, a, libel, identifying, england, with, the, ideals, of, democratic, athens, against, the, belligerence, of, spain, bacon, took, his, third, parliamentary, seat, for, middlesex, when, in, february, 1593, elizabeth, summoned, parliament, to, investigate, a, roman, catholic, plot, against, her, bacon, s, opposition, to, a, bill, that, would, levy, triple, subsidies, in, half, the, usual, time, offended, the, queen, opponents, accused, him, of, seeking, popularity, and, for, a, time, the, court, excluded, him, from, favour, when, the, office, of, attorney, general, fell, vacant, in, 1594, lord, essex, s, influence, was, not, enough, to, secure, the, position, for, bacon, and, it, was, given, to, sir, edward, coke, likewise, bacon, failed, to, secure, the, lesser, office, of, solicitor, general, in, 1595, the, queen, pointedly, snubbing, him, by, appointing, sir, thomas, fleming, instead, to, console, him, for, these, disappointments, essex, presented, him, with, a, property, at, twickenham, which, bacon, subsequently, sold, for, 1, 800, in, 1597, bacon, became, the, first, queen, s, counsel, designate, when, queen, elizabeth, reserved, him, as, her, legal, counsel, in, 1597, he, was, also, given, a, patent, giving, him, precedence, at, the, bar, despite, his, designations, he, was, unable, to, gain, the, status, and, notoriety, of, others, in, a, plan, to, revive, his, position, he, unsuccessfully, courted, the, wealthy, young, widow, lady, elizabeth, hatton, his, courtship, failed, after, she, broke, off, their, relationship, upon, accepting, marriage, to, sir, edward, coke, a, further, spark, of, enmity, between, the, men, in, 1598, bacon, was, arrested, for, debt, afterward, however, his, standing, in, the, queen, s, eyes, improved, gradually, bacon, earned, the, standing, of, one, of, the, learned, counsels, his, relationship, with, the, queen, further, improved, when, he, severed, ties, with, essex, a, shrewd, move, as, essex, would, be, executed, for, treason, in, 1601, with, others, bacon, was, appointed, to, investigate, the, charges, against, essex, a, number, of, essex, s, followers, confessed, that, essex, had, planned, a, rebellion, against, the, queen, bacon, was, subsequently, a, part, of, the, legal, team, headed, by, the, attorney, general, sir, edward, coke, at, essex, s, treason, trial, after, the, execution, the, queen, ordered, bacon, to, write, the, official, government, account, of, the, trial, which, was, later, published, as, a, declaration, of, the, practices, and, treasons, attempted, and, committed, by, robert, late, earle, of, essex, and, his, complices, against, her, majestie, and, her, kingdoms, after, bacon, s, first, draft, was, heavily, edited, by, the, queen, and, her, ministers, according, to, his, personal, secretary, and, chaplain, william, rawley, as, a, judge, bacon, was, always, tender, hearted, looking, upon, the, examples, with, the, eye, of, severity, but, upon, the, person, with, the, eye, of, pity, and, compassion, and, also, that, he, was, free, from, malice, no, revenger, of, injuries, and, no, defamer, of, any, man, the, succession, of, james, i, brought, bacon, into, greater, favour, he, was, knighted, in, 1603, in, another, shrewd, move, bacon, wrote, his, apologies, in, defence, of, his, proceedings, in, the, case, of, essex, as, essex, had, favoured, james, to, succeed, to, the, throne, the, following, year, during, the, course, of, the, uneventful, first, parliamentary, session, bacon, married, alice, barnham, in, june, 1607, he, was, at, last, rewarded, with, the, office, of, solicitor, general, and, in, 1608, he, began, working, as, the, clerkship, of, the, star, chamber, despite, a, generous, income, old, debts, still, could, not, be, paid, he, sought, further, promotion, and, wealth, by, supporting, king, james, and, his, arbitrary, policies, in, 1610, the, fourth, session, of, james, s, first, parliament, met, despite, bacon, s, advice, to, him, james, and, the, commons, found, themselves, at, odds, over, royal, prerogatives, and, the, king, s, embarrassing, extravagance, the, house, was, finally, dissolved, in, february, 1611, throughout, this, period, bacon, managed, to, stay, in, favour, with, the, king, while, retaining, the, confidence, of, the, commons, in, 1613, bacon, was, finally, appointed, attorney, general, after, advising, the, king, to, shuffle, judicial, appointments, as, attorney, general, bacon, by, his, zealous, efforts, which, included, torture, to, obtain, the, conviction, of, edmund, peacham, for, treason, raised, legal, controversies, of, high, constitutional, importance, bacon, and, gray, s, inn, produced, the, masque, of, flowers, to, celebrate, the, wedding, of, robert, carr, 1st, earl, of, somerset, and, his, wife, frances, howard, countess, of, somerset, and, he, successfully, prosecuted, them, for, murder, in, 1616, the, so, called, prince, s, parliament, of, april, 1614, objected, to, bacon, s, presence, in, the, seat, for, cambridge, and, to, the, various, royal, plans, that, bacon, had, supported, although, he, was, allowed, to, stay, parliament, passed, a, law, that, forbade, the, attorney, general, to, sit, in, parliament, his, influence, over, the, king, had, evidently, inspired, resentment, or, apprehension, in, many, of, his, peers, bacon, however, continued, to, receive, the, king, s, favour, which, led, to, his, appointment, in, march, 1617, as, temporary, regent, of, england, for, a, period, of, a, month, and, in, 1618, as, lord, chancellor, on, 12, july, 1618, the, king, created, bacon, baron, verulam, of, verulam, in, the, peerage, of, england, he, then, became, known, as, francis, lord, verulam, bacon, continued, to, use, his, influence, with, the, king, to, mediate, between, the, throne, and, parliament, and, in, this, capacity, he, was, further, elevated, in, the, same, peerage, as, viscount, st, alban, on, 27, january, 1621, bacon, s, public, career, ended, in, disgrace, in, 1621, after, he, fell, into, debt, a, parliamentary, committee, on, the, administration, of, the, law, charged, him, with, 23, separate, counts, of, corruption, his, lifelong, enemy, sir, edward, coke, who, had, instigated, these, accusations, was, one, of, those, appointed, to, prepare, the, charges, against, the, chancellor, to, the, lords, who, sent, a, committee, to, enquire, whether, a, confession, was, really, his, he, replied, my, lords, it, is, my, act, my, hand, and, my, heart, i, beseech, your, lordships, to, be, merciful, to, a, broken, reed, he, was, sentenced, to, a, fine, of, 40, 000, and, committed, to, the, tower, of, london, at, the, king, s, pleasure, the, imprisonment, lasted, only, a, few, days, and, the, fine, was, remitted, by, the, king, more, seriously, parliament, declared, bacon, incapable, of, holding, future, office, or, sitting, in, parliament, he, narrowly, escaped, undergoing, degradation, which, would, have, stripped, him, of, his, titles, of, nobility, subsequently, the, disgraced, viscount, devoted, himself, to, study, and, writing, there, seems, little, doubt, that, bacon, had, accepted, gifts, from, litigants, but, this, was, an, accepted, custom, of, the, time, and, not, necessarily, evidence, of, deeply, corrupt, behaviour, while, acknowledging, that, his, conduct, had, been, lax, he, countered, that, he, had, never, allowed, gifts, to, influence, his, judgement, and, indeed, he, had, on, occasion, given, a, verdict, against, those, who, had, paid, him, he, even, had, an, interview, with, king, james, in, which, he, assured, the, law, of, nature, teaches, me, to, speak, in, my, own, defence, with, respect, to, this, charge, of, bribery, i, am, as, innocent, as, any, man, born, on, st, innocents, day, i, never, had, a, bribe, or, reward, in, my, eye, or, thought, when, pronouncing, judgment, or, order, i, am, ready, to, make, an, oblation, of, myself, to, the, king, he, also, wrote, the, following, to, george, villiers, 1st, duke, of, buckingham, my, mind, is, calm, for, my, fortune, is, not, my, felicity, i, know, i, have, clean, hands, and, a, clean, heart, and, i, hope, a, clean, house, for, friends, or, servants, but, job, himself, or, whoever, was, the, justest, judge, by, such, hunting, for, matters, against, him, as, hath, been, used, against, me, may, for, a, time, seem, foul, especially, in, a, time, when, greatness, is, the, mark, and, accusation, is, the, game, as, the, conduct, of, accepting, gifts, was, ubiquitous, and, common, practice, and, the, commons, was, zealously, inquiring, into, judicial, corruption, and, malfeasance, it, has, been, suggested, that, bacon, served, as, a, scapegoat, to, divert, attention, from, buckingham, s, own, ill, practice, and, alleged, corruption, the, true, reason, for, his, acknowledgement, of, guilt, is, the, subject, of, debate, but, some, authors, speculate, that, it, may, have, been, prompted, by, his, sickness, or, by, a, view, that, through, his, fame, and, the, greatness, of, his, office, he, would, be, spared, harsh, punishment, he, may, even, have, been, blackmailed, with, a, threat, to, charge, him, with, sodomy, into, confession, the, british, jurist, basil, montagu, wrote, in, bacon, s, defense, concerning, the, episode, of, his, public, disgrace, bacon, has, been, accused, of, servility, of, dissimulation, of, various, base, motives, and, their, filthy, brood, of, base, actions, all, unworthy, of, his, high, birth, and, incompatible, with, his, great, wisdom, and, the, estimation, in, which, he, was, held, by, the, noblest, spirits, of, the, age, it, is, true, that, there, were, men, in, his, own, time, and, will, be, men, in, all, times, who, are, better, pleased, to, count, spots, in, the, sun, than, to, rejoice, in, its, glorious, brightness, such, men, have, openly, libelled, him, like, dewes, and, weldon, whose, falsehoods, were, detected, as, soon, as, uttered, or, have, fastened, upon, certain, ceremonious, compliments, and, dedications, the, fashion, of, his, day, as, a, sample, of, his, servility, passing, over, his, noble, letters, to, the, queen, his, lofty, contempt, for, the, lord, keeper, puckering, his, open, dealing, with, sir, robert, cecil, and, with, others, who, powerful, when, he, was, nothing, might, have, blighted, his, opening, fortunes, for, ever, forgetting, his, advocacy, of, the, rights, of, the, people, in, the, face, of, the, court, and, the, true, and, honest, counsels, always, given, by, him, in, times, of, great, difficulty, both, to, elizabeth, and, her, successor, when, was, a, base, sycophant, loved, and, honoured, by, piety, such, as, that, of, herbert, tennison, and, rawley, by, noble, spirits, like, hobbes, ben, jonson, and, selden, or, followed, to, the, grave, and, beyond, it, with, devoted, affection, such, as, that, of, sir, thomas, meautys, bacon, was, a, devout, anglican, he, believed, that, philosophy, and, the, natural, world, must, be, studied, inductively, but, argued, that, we, can, only, study, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, information, about, god, s, attributes, such, as, nature, action, and, purposes, can, only, come, from, special, revelation, bacon, also, held, that, knowledge, was, cumulative, that, study, encompassed, more, than, a, simple, preservation, of, the, past, knowledge, is, the, rich, storehouse, for, the, glory, of, the, creator, and, the, relief, of, man, s, estate, he, wrote, in, his, essays, he, affirms, that, a, little, philosophy, inclineth, man, s, mind, to, atheism, but, depth, in, philosophy, bringeth, men, s, minds, about, to, religion, bacon, s, idea, of, idols, of, the, mind, may, have, self, consciously, represented, an, attempt, to, christianize, science, at, the, same, time, as, developing, a, new, reliable, scientific, method, bacon, gave, worship, of, neptune, as, an, example, of, the, idola, tribus, fallacy, hinting, at, the, religious, dimensions, of, his, critique, of, the, idols, bacon, was, against, the, splintering, within, christianity, believing, that, it, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, creation, of, atheism, as, a, dominant, worldview, as, indicated, with, his, quote, that, the, causes, of, atheism, are, divisions, in, religion, if, they, be, many, for, any, one, main, division, addeth, zeal, to, both, sides, but, many, divisions, introduce, atheism, another, is, scandal, of, priests, when, it, is, come, to, that, which, st, bernard, saith, one, cannot, now, say, the, priest, is, as, the, people, for, the, truth, is, that, the, people, are, not, so, bad, as, the, priest, a, third, is, custom, of, profane, scoffing, in, holy, matters, which, doth, by, little, and, little, deface, the, reverence, of, religion, and, lastly, learned, times, specially, with, peace, and, prosperity, for, troubles, and, adversities, do, more, bow, men, s, minds, to, religion, bacon, built, verulam, house, in, st, albans, to, his, own, designs, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, building, was, derivative, of, sir, rowland, hill, s, building, at, soulton, hall, when, he, was, 36, bacon, courted, elizabeth, hatton, a, young, widow, of, 20, reportedly, she, broke, off, their, relationship, upon, accepting, marriage, to, a, wealthier, man, bacon, s, rival, sir, edward, coke, years, later, bacon, still, wrote, of, his, regret, that, the, marriage, to, hatton, had, not, taken, place, at, the, age, of, 45, bacon, married, alice, barnham, the, 13, year, old, daughter, of, a, well, connected, london, alderman, and, mp, bacon, wrote, two, sonnets, proclaiming, his, love, for, alice, the, first, was, written, during, his, courtship, and, the, second, on, his, wedding, day, 10, may, 1606, when, bacon, was, appointed, lord, chancellor, by, special, warrant, of, the, king, lady, bacon, was, given, precedence, over, all, other, court, ladies, bacon, s, personal, secretary, and, chaplain, william, rawley, wrote, in, his, biography, of, bacon, that, his, marriage, was, one, of, much, conjugal, love, and, respect, mentioning, a, robe, of, honour, that, he, gave, to, alice, and, which, she, wore, unto, her, dying, day, being, twenty, years, and, more, after, his, death, however, an, increasing, number, of, reports, circulated, about, friction, in, the, marriage, with, speculation, that, this, may, have, been, due, to, alice, s, making, do, with, less, money, than, she, had, once, been, accustomed, to, it, was, said, that, she, was, strongly, interested, in, fame, and, fortune, and, when, household, finances, dwindled, she, complained, bitterly, bunten, wrote, in, her, life, of, alice, barnham, that, upon, their, descent, into, debt, she, went, on, trips, to, ask, for, financial, favours, and, assistance, from, their, circle, of, friends, bacon, disinherited, her, upon, discovering, her, secret, romantic, relationship, with, sir, john, underhill, rewriting, his, will, which, had, generously, planned, to, leave, her, lands, goods, and, income, and, revoking, her, entirely, as, a, beneficiary, several, authors, believe, that, despite, his, marriage, bacon, was, primarily, attracted, to, men, forker, for, example, has, explored, the, historically, documentable, sexual, preferences, of, both, francis, bacon, and, king, james, i, and, concluded, they, were, both, oriented, to, masculine, love, a, contemporary, term, that, seems, to, have, been, used, exclusively, to, refer, to, the, sexual, preference, of, men, for, members, of, their, own, gender, bacon, s, sexuality, has, been, disputed, by, others, who, point, to, lack, of, consistent, evidence, and, consider, the, sources, to, be, more, open, to, interpretation, the, jacobean, antiquary, and, bacon, s, fellow, parliament, member, sir, simonds, d, ewes, implied, there, had, been, a, question, of, bringing, bacon, to, trial, for, buggery, with, which, his, brother, anthony, bacon, had, also, been, charged, bacon, s, brother, apparently, also, was, homosexual, according, to, literature, and, sexuality, scholar, joseph, cady, in, his, autobiography, and, correspondence, diary, entry, for, 3, may, 1621, the, date, of, bacon, s, censure, by, parliament, d, ewes, describes, bacon, s, love, for, his, welsh, serving, men, in, particular, his, servant, mr, henry, godrick, or, goodrick, a, very, effeminate, faced, youth, whom, he, calls, his, catamite, and, bedfellow, bacon, s, own, mother, complained, to, anthony, on, bacon, s, affection, for, another, servant, of, his, named, percy, whom, she, wrote, bacon, kept, as, a, coach, companion, and, bed, companion, in, his, brief, lives, sketches, likely, composed, during, 1665, 1690, and, published, as, a, book, in, 1813, the, antiquary, john, aubrey, wrote, that, bacon, was, a, pederast, whose, ganimeds, and, favourites, tooke, bribes, while, pederast, strictly, denoted, boy, lover, in, earlier, times, cady, wrote, that, aubrey, deployed, the, term, discreetly, in, the, original, greek, to, signify, male, homosexual, the, figure, of, ganymede, he, continued, was, another, of, many, common, ways, of, referring, obliquely, to, homosexuality, in, new, atlantis, bacon, described, his, utopian, island, as, being, the, chastest, nation, under, heaven, with, no, touch, of, masculine, love, cady, argued, that, bacon, s, reference, to, male, homosexuality, in, the, new, atlantis, deliberately, gave, the, appearance, of, coming, from, outside, the, phenomenon, due, to, prevalent, opposition, it, contrasted, deliberately, with, veiled, praise, of, the, topic, elsewhere, in, bacon, s, work, he, asserted, cady, offered, several, examples, including, that, bacon, discussed, only, male, beauty, in, his, short, essay, of, beauty, he, also, noted, that, bacon, ended, his, monologue, the, masculine, birth, of, time, with, an, older, man, asking, a, younger, one, from, his, inmost, heart, to, give, yourself, to, me, so, that, i, may, restore, you, to, yourself, and, secure, an, increase, beyond, all, hopes, and, prayers, of, ordinary, marriages, on, 9, april, 1626, bacon, died, of, pneumonia, at, highgate, outside, london, specifically, at, arundel, house, a, country, residence, of, his, friend, the, earl, of, arundel, though, arundel, was, then, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, an, influential, account, of, the, circumstances, of, his, death, was, given, by, john, aubrey, s, brief, lives, aubrey, s, vivid, account, which, portrays, bacon, as, a, martyr, to, experimental, scientific, method, has, him, journeying, to, high, gate, through, the, snow, with, the, king, s, physician, when, he, is, suddenly, inspired, by, the, possibility, of, using, the, snow, to, preserve, meat, they, were, resolved, they, would, try, the, experiment, presently, they, alighted, out, of, the, coach, and, went, into, a, poor, woman, s, house, at, the, bottom, of, highgate, hill, and, bought, a, fowl, and, made, the, woman, exenterate, it, after, stuffing, the, fowl, with, snow, bacon, contracted, a, fatal, case, of, pneumonia, some, people, including, aubrey, consider, these, two, contiguous, possibly, coincidental, events, as, related, and, causative, of, his, death, the, snow, so, chilled, him, that, he, immediately, fell, so, extremely, ill, that, he, could, not, return, to, his, lodging, but, went, to, the, earle, of, arundel, s, house, at, highgate, where, they, put, him, into, a, damp, bed, that, had, not, been, layn, in, which, gave, him, such, a, cold, that, in, 2, or, 3, days, as, i, remember, mr, hobbes, told, me, he, died, of, suffocation, aubrey, has, been, criticized, for, his, evident, credulousness, in, this, and, other, works, on, the, other, hand, he, knew, thomas, hobbes, bacon, s, fellow, philosopher, and, friend, being, unwittingly, on, his, deathbed, the, philosopher, dictated, his, last, letter, to, the, earl, my, very, good, lord, i, was, likely, to, have, had, the, fortune, of, caius, plinius, the, elder, who, lost, his, life, by, trying, an, experiment, about, the, burning, of, mount, vesuvius, for, i, was, also, desirous, to, try, an, experiment, or, two, touching, the, conservation, and, in, duration, of, bodies, as, for, the, experiment, itself, it, succeeded, excellently, well, but, in, the, journey, between, london, and, high, gate, i, was, taken, with, such, a, fit, of, casting, as, i, know, not, whether, it, were, the, stone, or, some, surfeit, or, cold, or, indeed, a, touch, of, them, all, three, but, when, i, came, to, your, lordship, s, house, i, was, not, able, to, go, back, and, therefore, was, forced, to, take, up, my, lodging, here, where, your, housekeeper, is, very, careful, and, diligent, about, me, which, i, assure, myself, your, lordship, will, not, only, pardon, towards, him, but, think, the, better, of, him, for, it, for, indeed, your, lordship, s, house, was, happy, to, me, and, i, kiss, your, noble, hands, for, the, welcome, which, i, am, sure, you, give, me, to, it, i, know, how, unfit, it, is, for, me, to, write, with, any, other, hand, than, mine, own, but, by, my, troth, my, fingers, are, so, disjointed, with, sickness, that, i, cannot, steadily, hold, a, pen, another, account, appears, in, a, biography, by, william, rawley, bacon, s, personal, secretary, and, chaplain, he, died, on, the, ninth, day, of, april, in, the, year, 1626, in, the, early, morning, of, the, day, then, celebrated, for, our, savior, s, resurrection, in, the, sixty, sixth, year, of, his, age, at, the, earl, of, arundel, s, house, in, highgate, near, london, to, which, place, he, casually, repaired, about, a, week, before, god, so, ordaining, that, he, should, die, there, of, a, gentle, fever, accidentally, accompanied, with, a, great, cold, whereby, the, defluxion, of, rheum, fell, so, plentifully, upon, his, breast, that, he, died, by, suffocation, he, was, buried, in, st, michael, s, church, in, st, albans, at, the, news, of, his, death, over, 30, great, minds, collected, together, their, eulogies, of, him, which, were, then, later, published, in, latin, he, left, personal, assets, of, about, 7, 000, and, lands, that, realised, 6, 000, when, sold, his, debts, amounted, to, more, than, 23, 000, equivalent, to, more, than, 4m, at, current, value, francis, bacon, s, philosophy, is, displayed, in, the, vast, and, varied, writings, he, left, which, might, be, divided, into, three, great, branches, bacon, s, seminal, work, novum, organum, was, influential, in, the, 1630s, and, 1650s, among, scholars, in, particular, sir, thomas, browne, who, in, his, encyclopedia, pseudodoxia, epidemica, 1646, 72, frequently, adheres, to, a, baconian, approach, to, his, scientific, enquiries, this, book, entails, the, basis, of, the, scientific, method, as, a, means, of, observation, and, induction, according, to, bacon, learning, and, knowledge, all, derive, from, the, basis, of, inductive, reasoning, through, his, belief, in, experimental, encounters, he, theorised, that, all, the, knowledge, that, was, necessary, to, fully, understand, a, concept, could, be, attained, using, induction, in, order, to, get, to, the, point, of, an, inductive, conclusion, one, must, consider, the, importance, of, observing, the, particulars, specific, parts, of, nature, once, these, particulars, have, been, gathered, together, the, interpretation, of, nature, proceeds, by, sorting, them, into, a, formal, arrangement, so, that, they, may, be, presented, to, the, understanding, experimentation, is, essential, to, discovering, the, truths, of, nature, when, an, experiment, happens, parts, of, the, tested, hypothesis, are, started, to, be, pieced, together, forming, a, result, and, conclusion, through, this, conclusion, of, particulars, an, understanding, of, nature, can, be, formed, now, that, an, understanding, of, nature, has, been, arrived, at, an, inductive, conclusion, can, be, drawn, for, no, one, successfully, investigates, the, nature, of, a, thing, in, the, thing, itself, the, inquiry, must, be, enlarged, to, things, that, have, more, in, common, with, it, bacon, explains, how, we, come, to, this, understanding, and, knowledge, because, of, this, process, in, comprehending, the, complexities, of, nature, bacon, sees, nature, as, an, extremely, subtle, complexity, which, affords, all, the, energy, of, the, natural, philosopher, to, disclose, her, secrets, bacon, described, the, evidence, and, proof, revealed, through, taking, a, specific, example, from, nature, and, expanding, that, example, into, a, general, substantial, claim, of, nature, once, we, understand, the, particulars, in, nature, we, can, learn, more, about, it, and, become, surer, of, things, occurring, in, nature, gaining, knowledge, and, obtaining, new, information, all, the, while, it, is, nothing, less, than, a, revival, of, bacon, s, supremely, confident, belief, that, inductive, methods, can, provide, us, with, ultimate, and, infallible, answers, concerning, the, laws, and, nature, of, the, universe, bacon, states, that, when, we, come, to, understand, parts, of, nature, we, can, eventually, understand, nature, better, as, a, whole, because, of, induction, because, of, this, bacon, concludes, that, all, learning, and, knowledge, must, be, drawn, from, inductive, reasoning, during, the, restoration, bacon, was, commonly, invoked, as, a, guiding, spirit, of, the, royal, society, founded, under, charles, ii, in, 1660, during, the, 18th, century, french, enlightenment, bacon, s, non, metaphysical, approach, to, science, became, more, influential, than, the, dualism, of, his, french, contemporary, descartes, and, was, associated, with, criticism, of, the, ancien, r, gime, in, 1733, voltaire, introduced, him, to, a, french, audience, as, the, father, of, the, scientific, method, an, understanding, which, had, become, widespread, by, the, 1750s, in, the, 19th, century, his, emphasis, on, induction, was, revived, and, developed, by, william, whewell, among, others, he, has, been, reputed, as, the, father, of, experimental, philosophy, he, also, wrote, a, long, treatise, on, medicine, history, of, life, and, death, with, natural, and, experimental, observations, for, the, prolongation, of, life, one, of, his, biographers, the, historian, william, hepworth, dixon, states, bacon, s, influence, in, the, modern, world, is, so, great, that, every, man, who, rides, in, a, train, sends, a, telegram, follows, a, steam, plough, sits, in, an, easy, chair, crosses, the, channel, or, the, atlantic, eats, a, good, dinner, enjoys, a, beautiful, garden, or, undergoes, a, painless, surgical, operation, owes, him, something, in, 1902, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, published, a, fictional, letter, known, as, the, lord, chandos, letter, addressed, to, bacon, and, dated, 1603, about, a, writer, who, is, experiencing, a, crisis, of, language, bacon, played, a, leading, role, in, establishing, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, especially, in, virginia, the, carolinas, and, newfoundland, in, northeastern, canada, his, government, report, on, the, virginia, colony, was, submitted, in, 1609, in, 1610, bacon, and, his, associates, received, a, charter, from, the, king, to, form, the, tresurer, and, the, companye, of, adventurers, and, planter, of, the, cittye, of, london, and, bristoll, for, the, collonye, or, plantacon, in, newfoundland, and, sent, john, guy, to, found, a, colony, there, thomas, jefferson, the, third, president, of, the, united, states, wrote, bacon, locke, and, newton, i, consider, them, as, the, three, greatest, men, that, have, ever, lived, without, any, exception, and, as, having, laid, the, foundation, of, those, superstructures, which, have, been, raised, in, the, physical, and, moral, sciences, in, 1910, newfoundland, issued, a, postage, stamp, to, commemorate, bacon, s, role, in, establishing, the, colony, the, stamp, describes, bacon, as, the, guiding, spirit, in, colonization, schemes, in, 1610, moreover, some, scholars, believe, he, was, largely, responsible, for, the, drafting, in, 1609, and, 1612, of, two, charters, of, government, for, the, virginia, colony, william, hepworth, dixon, considered, that, bacon, s, name, could, be, included, in, the, list, of, founders, of, the, united, states, although, few, of, his, proposals, for, law, reform, were, adopted, during, his, lifetime, bacon, s, legal, legacy, was, considered, by, the, magazine, new, scientist, in, 1961, as, having, influenced, the, drafting, of, the, napoleonic, code, as, well, as, the, law, reforms, introduced, by, 19th, century, british, prime, minister, sir, robert, peel, the, historian, william, hepworth, dixon, referred, to, the, napoleonic, code, as, the, sole, embodiment, of, bacon, s, thought, saying, that, bacon, s, legal, work, has, had, more, success, abroad, than, it, has, found, at, home, and, that, in, france, it, has, blossomed, and, come, into, fruit, harvey, wheeler, attributed, to, bacon, in, francis, bacon, s, verulamium, the, common, law, template, of, the, modern, in, english, science, and, culture, the, creation, of, these, distinguishing, features, of, the, modern, common, law, system, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, some, juries, still, declared, the, law, rather, than, the, facts, but, already, before, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, sir, matthew, hale, explained, modern, common, law, adjudication, procedure, and, acknowledged, bacon, as, the, inventor, of, the, process, of, discovering, unwritten, laws, from, the, evidences, of, their, applications, the, method, combined, empiricism, and, inductivism, in, a, new, way, that, was, to, imprint, its, signature, on, many, of, the, distinctive, features, of, modern, english, society, paul, h, kocher, writes, that, bacon, is, considered, by, some, jurists, to, be, the, father, of, modern, jurisprudence, bacon, is, commemorated, with, a, statue, in, gray, s, inn, south, square, in, london, where, he, received, his, legal, training, and, where, he, was, elected, treasurer, of, the, inn, in, 1608, more, recent, scholarship, on, bacon, s, jurisprudence, has, focused, on, his, advocating, torture, as, a, legal, recourse, for, the, crown, bacon, himself, was, not, a, stranger, to, the, torture, chamber, in, his, various, legal, capacities, in, both, elizabeth, i, s, and, james, i, s, reigns, bacon, was, listed, as, a, commissioner, on, five, torture, warrants, in, 1613, in, a, letter, addressed, to, king, james, i, on, the, question, of, torture, s, place, within, english, law, bacon, identifies, the, scope, of, torture, as, a, means, to, further, the, investigation, of, threats, to, the, state, in, the, cases, of, treasons, torture, is, used, for, discovery, and, not, for, evidence, for, bacon, torture, was, not, a, punitive, measure, an, intended, form, of, state, repression, but, instead, offered, a, modus, operandi, for, the, government, agent, tasked, with, uncovering, acts, of, treason, francis, bacon, developed, the, idea, that, a, classification, of, knowledge, must, be, universal, while, handling, all, possible, resources, in, his, progressive, view, humanity, would, be, better, if, access, to, educational, resources, were, provided, to, the, public, hence, the, need, to, organise, it, his, approach, to, learning, reshaped, the, western, view, of, knowledge, theory, from, an, individual, to, a, social, interest, the, original, classification, proposed, by, bacon, organised, all, types, of, knowledge, into, three, general, groups, history, poetry, and, philosophy, he, did, that, based, on, his, understanding, of, how, information, is, processed, memory, imagination, and, reason, respectively, his, methodical, approach, to, the, categorization, of, knowledge, goes, hand, in, hand, with, his, principles, of, scientific, methods, bacon, s, writings, were, the, starting, point, for, william, torrey, harris, s, classification, system, for, libraries, in, the, united, states, by, the, second, half, of, the, 1800s, the, phrase, scientia, potentia, est, or, scientia, est, potentia, meaning, knowledge, is, power, is, commonly, attributed, to, bacon, the, expression, ipsa, scientia, potestas, est, knowledge, itself, is, power, occurs, in, his, meditationes, sacrae, 1597, the, baconian, hypothesis, of, shakespearean, authorship, first, proposed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, contends, that, francis, bacon, wrote, some, or, even, all, of, the, plays, conventionally, attributed, to, william, shakespeare, francis, bacon, often, gathered, with, the, men, at, gray, s, inn, to, discuss, politics, and, philosophy, and, to, try, out, various, theatrical, scenes, that, he, admitted, writing, bacon, s, alleged, connection, to, the, rosicrucians, and, the, freemasons, has, been, widely, discussed, by, authors, and, scholars, in, many, books, however, others, including, daphne, du, maurier, in, her, biography, of, bacon, have, argued, that, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, to, support, claims, of, involvement, with, the, rosicrucians, frances, yates, does, not, make, the, claim, that, bacon, was, a, rosicrucian, but, presents, evidence, that, he, was, nevertheless, involved, in, some, of, the, more, closed, intellectual, movements, of, his, day, she, argues, that, bacon, s, movement, for, the, advancement, of, learning, was, closely, connected, with, the, german, rosicrucian, movement, while, bacon, s, new, atlantis, portrays, a, land, ruled, by, rosicrucians, he, apparently, saw, his, own, movement, for, the, advancement, of, learning, to, be, in, conformity, with, rosicrucian, ideals, the, link, between, bacon, s, work, and, the, rosicrucians, ideals, which, yates, allegedly, found, was, the, conformity, of, the, purposes, expressed, by, the, rosicrucian, manifestos, and, bacon, s, plan, of, a, great, instauration, for, the, two, were, calling, for, a, reformation, of, both, divine, and, human, understanding, as, well, as, both, had, in, view, the, purpose, of, mankind, s, return, to, the, state, before, the, fall, another, major, link, is, said, to, be, the, resemblance, between, bacon, s, new, atlantis, and, the, german, rosicrucian, johann, valentin, andreae, s, description, of, the, republic, of, christianopolis, 1619, andreae, describes, a, utopic, island, in, which, christian, theosophy, and, applied, science, ruled, and, in, which, the, spiritual, fulfilment, and, intellectual, activity, constituted, the, primary, goals, of, each, individual, the, scientific, pursuits, being, the, highest, intellectual, calling, linked, to, the, achievement, of, spiritual, perfection, andreae, s, island, also, depicts, a, great, advancement, in, technology, with, many, industries, separated, in, different, zones, which, supplied, the, population, s, needs, which, shows, great, resemblance, to, bacon, s, scientific, methods, and, purposes, while, rejecting, occult, conspiracy, theories, surrounding, bacon, and, the, claim, bacon, personally, identified, as, a, rosicrucian, intellectual, historian, paolo, rossi, has, argued, for, an, occult, influence, on, bacon, s, scientific, and, religious, writing, he, argues, that, bacon, was, familiar, with, early, modern, alchemical, texts, and, that, bacon, s, ideas, about, the, application, of, science, had, roots, in, renaissance, magical, ideas, about, science, and, magic, facilitating, humanity, s, domination, of, nature, rossi, further, interprets, bacon, s, search, for, hidden, meanings, in, myth, and, fables, in, such, texts, as, the, wisdom, of, the, ancients, as, succeeding, earlier, occultist, and, neoplatonic, attempts, to, locate, hidden, wisdom, in, pre, christian, myths, as, indicated, by, the, title, of, his, study, however, rossi, claims, bacon, ultimately, rejected, the, philosophical, foundations, of, occultism, as, he, came, to, develop, a, form, of, modern, science, rossi, s, analysis, and, claims, have, been, extended, by, jason, josephson, storm, in, his, study, the, myth, of, disenchantment, josephson, storm, also, rejects, conspiracy, theories, surrounding, bacon, and, does, not, make, the, claim, that, bacon, was, an, active, rosicrucian, however, he, argues, that, bacon, s, rejection, of, magic, actually, constituted, an, attempt, to, purify, magic, of, catholic, demonic, and, esoteric, influences, and, to, establish, magic, as, a, field, of, study, and, application, paralleling, bacon, s, vision, of, science, furthermore, josephson, storm, argues, that, bacon, drew, on, magical, ideas, when, developing, his, experimental, method, josephson, storm, finds, evidence, that, bacon, considered, nature, a, living, entity, populated, by, spirits, and, argues, bacon, s, views, on, the, human, domination, and, application, of, nature, actually, depend, on, his, spiritualism, and, personification, of, nature, the, rosicrucian, organization, amorc, claims, that, bacon, was, the, imperator, leader, of, the, rosicrucian, order, in, both, england, and, the, european, continent, and, would, have, directed, it, during, his, lifetime, bacon, s, influence, can, also, be, seen, on, a, variety, of, religious, and, spiritual, authors, and, on, groups, that, have, utilized, his, writings, in, their, own, belief, systems, some, of, the, more, notable, works, by, bacon, are
