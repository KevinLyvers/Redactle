schumacher, s, driving, style, using, telemetry, data, it, was, observed, that, schumacher, was, very, sensitive, and, flexible, on, the, gas, and, brakes, compared, with, his, ferrari, teammate, rubens, barrichello, who, often, either, braked, or, accelerated, in, a, corner, schumacher, usually, braked, later, into, a, corner, and, stabilised, his, car, by, accelerating, slightly, often, using, both, the, brake, and, accelerator, pedals, at, the, same, time, exiting, a, corner, schumacher, accelerated, considerably, and, balanced, his, car, by, braking, lightly, martin, brundle, talked, about, being, in, awe, upon, seeing, schumacher, s, telemetry, showing, he, took, turn, one, on, full, throttle, at, the, suzuka, circuit, with, his, driving, style, schumacher, also, went, 25, km, h, faster, through, the, hairpin, corner, of, suzuka, compared, to, barrichello, who, lost, 0, 3, seconds, to, schumacher, in, this, corner, it, was, also, observed, that, when, needed, such, as, when, the, brakes, started, to, overheat, schumacher, adapted, his, driving, style, to, protect, the, brakes, motor, sport, author, christopher, hilton, observed, in, 2003, that, a, measure, of, a, driver, s, capabilities, is, his, performance, in, wet, races, because, the, most, delicate, car, control, and, sensitivity, are, needed, and, commented, that, like, other, great, drivers, schumacher, s, record, in, wet, conditions, shows, very, few, mistakes, up, to, the, end, of, 2003, schumacher, won, 17, of, the, 30, races, in, wet, conditions, he, contested, some, of, schumacher,

nicknames, also, include, schumi, schuey, and, schu, schumacher, has, often, been, credited, with, popularising, formula, one, worldwide, especially, in, germany, where, it, was, formerly, considered, a, fringe, sport, in, a, 2006, fia, survey, he, was, voted, the, most, popular, driver, of, the, season, among, formula, one, fans, throughout, his, career, schumacher, was, subject, to, anti, german, prejudices, especially, from, the, british, media, about, his, collision, with, schumacher, in, 1994, british, driver, damon, hill, wrote, there, are, two, things, that, set, michael, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, drivers, in, formula, one, his, sheer, talent, and, his, attitude, i, am, full, of, admiration, for, the, former, but, the, latter, leaves, me, cold, in, addition, to, hill, schumacher, also, had, rivalries, with, mika, h, kkinen, whom, he, beat, for, his, first, world, championship, at, ferrari, and, the, team, s, first, drivers, championship, since, the, 1979, season, and, fernando, alonso, who, ended, schumacher, s, five, consecutive, titles, in, the, 2000s, despite, only, facing, him, during, schumacher, s, brief, comeback, in, the, 2010s, lewis, hamilton, is, also, seen, a, rival, due, to, their, similar, achievements, and, driving, styles, and, cited, him, as, inspiration, when, schumacher, first, retired, in, 2006, three, of, the, top, ten, drivers, in, that, year, s, drivers, standings, were, german, more, than, any, other, nationality, younger, german, drivers, such, as, sebastian, vettel, felt, schumacher, was, key, in, their, becoming, formula, one, drivers, in, 2020, vettel, named, schumacher, the, greatest, formula, one, driver, of, all, time, during, a, large, part, of, his, formula, one, career, schumacher, was, the, president, of, the, grand, prix, drivers, association, a, representative, body, originally, set, up, in, 1961, that, had, been, disbanded, in, 1982, and, schumacher, had, helped, to, relaunch, in, 1994, in, 2006, formula, one, rival, david, coulthard, hailed, schumacher, as, the, greatest, all, round, racing, driver, in, the, history, of, the, sport, while, three, time, world, champion, niki, lauda, stated, he, is, the, greatest, nobody, will, ever, beat, him, as, long, as, we, are, alive, in, 2020, schumacher, was, voted, the, most, influential, person, in, formula, one, history, schumacher, made, his, formula, one, debut, with, the, irish, jordan, ford, team, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, driving, car, number, 32, as, a, replacement, for, the, imprisoned, bertrand, gachot, schumacher, still, a, contracted, mercedes, driver, was, signed, by, eddie, jordan, after, mercedes, paid, jordan, 150, 000, for, his, debut, the, week, before, the, race, schumacher, impressed, jordan, designer, gary, anderson, and, team, manager, trevor, foster, during, a, test, drive, at, the, silverstone, circuit, schumacher, s, manager, weber, assured, jordan, that, schumacher, knew, the, challenging, spa, francorchamps, circuit, well, although, in, fact, he, had, only, seen, it, as, a, spectator, during, the, race, weekend, teammate, andrea, de, cesaris, was, meant, to, show, schumacher, the, circuit, but, was, held, up, with, contract, negotiations, schumacher, then, learned, the, track, on, his, own, by, cycling, around, the, track, on, a, fold, up, bike, he, brought, with, him, in, his, debut, schumacher, impressed, the, paddock, by, qualifying, seventh, he, did, so, in, a, midfield, car, the, jordan, 191, which, he, drove, half, a, day, of, testing, and, at, a, track, he, had, never, raced, at, this, also, matched, the, team, s, season, best, grid, position, and, schumacher, outqualified, veteran, de, cesaris, motor, sport, journalist, joe, saward, reported, that, after, qualifying, clumps, of, german, journalists, were, talking, about, the, best, talent, since, stefan, bellof, schumacher, retired, on, the, first, lap, of, the, race, with, clutch, problems, following, his, belgian, grand, prix, debut, despite, an, agreement, in, principle, between, jordan, and, schumacher, s, mercedes, management, that, would, see, the, german, race, for, the, irish, team, for, the, remainder, of, the, season, schumacher, was, engaged, by, benetton, ford, for, the, next, race, jordan, applied, for, an, injunction, in, the, british, courts, to, prevent, schumacher, driving, for, benetton, but, lost, the, case, as, they, had, not, yet, signed, a, final, contract, schumacher, finished, the, 1991, season, with, four, points, out, of, six, races, his, best, finish, was, fifth, in, his, second, race, the, italian, grand, prix, in, which, he, finished, ahead, of, his, teammate, and, three, time, world, champion, nelson, piquet, he, also, outqualified, piquet, four, times, out, of, five, in, the, season, run, in, and, scored, only, half, a, point, less, than, him, in, the, time, they, were, together, at, the, start, of, the, 1992, season, the, sauber, team, planning, their, formula, one, debut, with, mercedes, backing, for, the, following, year, invoked, a, clause, in, schumacher, s, contract, that, stated, that, if, mercedes, entered, formula, one, schumacher, would, drive, for, them, it, was, eventually, agreed, that, schumacher, would, stay, with, benetton, peter, sauber, stated, that, didn, t, want, to, drive, for, us, why, would, i, have, forced, him, the, year, was, dominated, by, the, williams, fw14b, of, nigel, mansell, and, riccardo, patrese, featuring, powerful, renault, engines, semi, automatic, gearboxes, and, active, suspension, to, control, the, car, s, ride, height, in, the, conventional, benetton, b192, schumacher, took, his, place, on, the, podium, for, the, first, time, finishing, third, in, the, mexican, grand, prix, through, what, has, been, described, as, a, tactical, masterstroke, he, went, on, to, take, his, first, victory, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, in, a, wet, race, at, the, spa, francorchamps, circuit, which, by, 2003, he, would, call, far, and, away, my, favourite, track, that, also, marked, as, the, last, formula, one, car, to, win, a, grand, prix, while, sporting, a, h, pattern, manual, gearbox, from, the, 1992, portuguese, grand, prix, to, the, 1998, monaco, grand, prix, schumacher, was, not, beaten, by, his, teammate, when, both, cars, finished, 1992, was, also, the, first, of, many, times, that, schumacher, beat, his, teammate, through, a, full, season, and, martin, brundle, was, fired, as, a, result, benetton, team, boss, flavio, briatore, later, regretted, this, decision, saying, that, he, had, underestimated, the, ability, of, both, his, drivers, schumacher, finished, third, in, the, drivers, championship, in, 1992, with, 53, points, three, points, behind, runner, up, patrese, and, three, in, front, of, the, brazilian, ayrton, senna, according, to, jo, ram, rez, a, close, friend, of, senna, the, brazilian, considered, schumacher, the, next, big, threat, way, ahead, of, all, the, other, drivers, around, at, the, time, the, williams, fw15c, of, damon, hill, and, alain, prost, dominated, the, 1993, season, as, well, benetton, introduced, their, own, active, suspension, and, traction, control, early, in, the, season, last, of, the, frontrunning, teams, to, do, so, schumacher, won, one, race, the, portuguese, grand, prix, where, he, beat, prost, and, had, nine, podium, finishes, he, retired, in, seven, of, the, other, 16, races, he, finished, the, season, in, fourth, with, 52, points, beating, patrese, as, teammate, so, much, so, that, briatore, and, his, team, thought, that, patrese, was, washed, up, and, that, they, had, no, problem, with, their, car, schumacher, won, his, first, drivers, championship, in, 1994, driving, the, benetton, b194, which, has, been, called, the, worst, car, to, have, won, a, formula, one, world, championship, and, was, difficult, to, drive, so, much, so, that, schumacher, had, three, different, teammates, jj, lehto, jos, verstappen, and, johnny, herbert, due, to, crashes, schumacher, won, the, first, four, races, and, finished, the, season, with, eight, wins, he, won, six, of, the, first, seven, races, including, the, brazilian, grand, prix, in, which, he, lapped, the, entire, field, and, was, leading, the, spanish, grand, prix, before, a, gearbox, failure, left, him, stuck, in, fifth, gear, for, most, of, the, race, schumacher, made, two, pit, stops, without, stalling, and, finished, the, race, in, second, place, benetton, boss, flavio, briatore, stated, that, schumacher, s, drive, was, one, of, the, best, he, had, ever, seen, the, 1994, season, was, marred, by, the, death, of, ayrton, senna, which, was, witnessed, by, schumacher, who, was, directly, behind, senna, and, that, of, roland, ratzenberger, during, the, san, marino, grand, prix, there, were, also, allegations, of, cheating, during, the, 1994, formula, one, season, involving, several, teams, most, particularly, schumacher, s, benetton, having, allegedly, broken, the, sport, s, technical, regulations, following, the, san, marino, grand, prix, the, benetton, ferrari, and, mclaren, teams, were, investigated, on, suspicion, of, breaking, the, fia, imposed, ban, on, electronic, aids, benetton, and, mclaren, initially, refused, to, hand, over, their, source, code, for, investigation, when, they, did, so, the, fia, discovered, hidden, functionality, in, both, teams, software, but, no, evidence, that, it, had, been, used, in, a, race, both, teams, were, fined, 100, 000, for, their, initial, refusal, to, cooperate, the, mclaren, software, which, was, a, gearbox, program, that, allowed, automatic, shifts, was, deemed, legal, by, contrast, the, benetton, software, was, deemed, to, be, a, form, of, launch, control, that, would, have, allowed, schumacher, to, make, perfect, starts, which, was, explicitly, outlawed, by, the, regulations, benetton, and, willem, toet, a, formula, one, aerodynamicist, for, over, thirty, years, who, worked, at, benetton, until, 1994, stated, that, traction, control, was, legally, achieved, through, rotational, inertia, there, was, no, evidence, to, suggest, the, software, was, used, at, the, british, grand, prix, schumacher, was, penalised, for, overtaking, hill, on, the, formation, lap, he, and, benetton, then, ignored, the, penalty, and, the, subsequent, black, flag, which, indicates, that, the, driver, must, immediately, return, to, the, pits, for, which, he, was, disqualified, and, later, given, a, two, race, ban, benetton, blamed, the, incident, on, a, communication, error, between, the, stewards, and, the, team, schumacher, was, also, disqualified, after, winning, the, belgian, grand, prix, after, his, car, was, found, to, have, illegal, wear, on, its, skid, block, a, measure, used, after, the, accidents, at, imola, to, limit, downforce, and, hence, cornering, speed, benetton, protested, that, the, skid, block, had, been, damaged, when, schumacher, spun, over, a, kerb, the, fia, rejected, their, appeal, because, of, the, pattern, of, wear, and, damage, visible, on, the, block, the, two, race, ban, punishment, was, seen, by, many, observers, as, petty, and, insignificant, and, that, it, was, a, result, of, benetton, feud, with, the, fia, with, schumacher, being, a, victim, and, the, fia, trying, to, deny, him, his, first, world, championship, these, incidents, helped, damon, hill, close, the, points, gap, and, schumacher, led, by, a, single, point, going, into, the, final, race, at, the, australian, grand, prix, on, lap, 36, schumacher, hit, the, guardrail, on, the, outside, of, the, track, while, leading, hill, attempted, to, pass, but, as, schumacher, s, car, returned, to, the, track, there, was, a, collision, on, the, corner, causing, them, both, to, retire, as, a, result, schumacher, won, the, drivers, championship, the, first, german, to, do, so, jochen, rindt, the, only, posthumous, drivers, champion, was, german, but, raced, under, the, austrian, flag, and, whose, domination, in, 1970, was, later, equalled, by, schumacher, the, race, stewards, judged, it, as, a, racing, accident, and, took, no, action, against, either, driver, although, the, drivers, championship, had, been, decided, in, a, similar, manner, in, 1989, and, 1990, public, opinion, was, divided, over, the, incident, and, schumacher, was, vilified, in, the, british, media, at, the, fia, conference, after, the, race, schumacher, dedicated, his, title, to, senna, in, 1995, schumacher, successfully, defended, his, title, with, benetton, which, now, had, the, same, renault, engine, as, williams, according, to, motor, sport, magazine, benetton, had, the, better, team, while, williams, had, the, superior, car, schumacher, accumulated, 33, more, points, than, second, placed, hill, with, herbert, as, teammate, he, took, benetton, to, its, first, constructors, championship, breaking, the, dominance, of, mclaren, and, williams, and, became, the, youngest, two, time, world, champion, in, formula, one, history, the, season, was, marred, by, several, collisions, with, hill, in, particular, an, overtaking, manoeuvre, by, hill, took, them, both, out, of, the, british, grand, prix, on, lap, 45, and, again, on, lap, 23, of, the, italian, grand, prix, it, also, saw, one, of, his, career, s, best, ovetakes, with, the, one, over, jean, alesi, giving, him, the, win, at, the, european, grand, prix, after, he, reduced, the, half, a, minute, gap, in, the, final, dozen, laps, schumacher, won, 9, of, the, 17, races, including, the, french, grand, prix, and, finished, on, the, podium, 11, times, it, was, only, once, that, he, qualify, worse, than, fourth, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, he, qualified, 16th, but, nevertheless, went, on, to, win, the, wet, dry, race, finishing, 16, seconds, ahead, of, hill, with, whom, he, had, ferocious, wheel, to, wheel, racing, and, involved, some, crucial, strategic, calls, his, bad, qualifying, was, a, result, of, a, crash, he, had, in, the, final, free, practice, and, by, the, time, his, car, was, rebuilt, it, had, started, to, rain, this, ended, his, 56, race, streak, of, outqualifiyng, his, teammates, that, started, in, 1992, after, he, missed, a, gear, in, qualifying, in, adelaide, in, 1991, and, was, outqualified, by, nelson, piquet, in, 1996, schumacher, joined, ferrari, a, team, that, had, last, won, the, drivers, championship, in, 1979, and, the, constructors, championship, in, 1983, for, a, salary, of, 60, million, over, two, years, he, left, benetton, a, year, before, his, contract, with, them, expired, he, later, cited, the, team, s, damaging, actions, in, 1994, as, his, reason, for, opting, out, of, his, deal, a, year, later, schumacher, lured, benetton, employees, rory, byrne, designer, and, ross, brawn, technical, director, to, ferrari, ferrari, had, previously, come, close, to, the, championship, in, 1982, and, 1990, the, team, had, suffered, a, disastrous, downturn, in, the, early, 1990s, partially, as, its, famous, v12, engine, was, no, longer, competitive, against, the, smaller, lighter, and, more, fuel, efficient, v10s, of, its, competitors, various, drivers, notably, alain, prost, had, given, the, vehicles, disparaging, labels, such, as, truck, pig, and, accident, waiting, to, happen, furthermore, the, poor, performance, of, the, ferrari, pit, crews, was, considered, a, running, joke, at, the, end, of, 1995, although, the, team, had, improved, into, a, solid, competitor, it, was, still, considered, inferior, to, front, running, teams, like, benetton, and, williams, schumacher, declared, the, ferrari, f310, good, enough, to, win, a, championship, although, afterwards, his, teammate, eddie, irvine, labelled, the, f310, an, awful, car, a, piece, of, junk, and, almost, undriveable, while, designer, john, barnard, admitted, that, the, car, wasn, t, very, good, irvine, also, later, commented, the, 96, car, was, a, disaster, and, was, nearly, undriveable, only, someone, of, michael, schumacher, s, ability, and, maybe, senna, could, have, driven, it, during, winter, testing, schumacher, first, drove, a, ferrari, their, 1995, ferrari, 412, t2, and, was, two, seconds, faster, than, former, regulars, jean, alesi, and, gerhard, berger, had, been, alesi, and, berger, were, allowed, to, drive, schumacher, s, benetton, b195, with, which, he, won, the, world, championship, in, 1995, and, they, could, not, believe, how, schumacher, had, won, with, it, calling, it, the, ugly, ducking, for, being, so, ugly, to, drive, and, having, many, crashes, in, a, 1999, interview, with, his, 1994, and, 1995, world, championship, rival, damon, hill, schumacher, recalled, you, remember, when, i, left, benetton, and, alesi, and, berger, took, their, first, steps, in, that, benetton, you, remember, how, many, crashes, they, had, i, mean, that, car, was, really, unbelievable, really, difficult, to, drive, it, was, so, edgy, but, it, was, fast, when, you, just, drove, it, exactly, on, that, edge, now, though, there, have, been, a, lot, of, aerodynamic, improvements, to, the, cars, and, so, the, cars, i, have, driven, have, been, a, lot, more, stable, and, that, applies, to, most, of, the, cars, today, schumacher, brawn, byrne, and, jean, todt, have, been, credited, as, turning, the, struggling, team, into, the, most, successful, team, in, formula, one, history, schumacher, became, the, byword, for, formula, one, and, motorsports, in, general, three, time, world, champion, jackie, stewart, believed, the, transformation, of, the, ferrari, team, was, schumacher, s, greatest, feat, at, ferrari, schumacher, scored, 72, grand, prix, wins, and, won, five, consecutive, drivers, titles, from, 2000, to, 2004, as, of, 2022, only, lewis, hamilton, and, mercedes, both, of, whom, were, schumacher, s, successor, and, his, career, last, team, were, considered, in, the, same, ballpark, in, terms, of, dominance, and, sustained, success, according, to, brawn, had, schumacher, not, retired, in, 2012, and, not, suffered, a, ski, injury, in, 2013, he, would, have, had, a, chance, at, winning, his, eighth, world, championship, in, 2014, in, 2023, williams, team, principal, james, vowles, who, was, mercedes, chief, strategist, during, schumacher, s, time, at, the, team, between, 2010, and, 2012, and, was, instrumental, in, the, team, s, success, in, the, mid, to, late, 2010s, said, that, schumacher, brought, mercedes, together, vowles, added, also, knew, his, performance, was, perhaps, not, quite, at, the, same, level, but, he, made, up, for, it, in, terms, of, the, amount, of, work, and, dedication, he, put, in, from, that, nico, learned, a, lot, and, conversely, lewis, learned, a, lot, from, nico, it, was, not, a, race, it, was, a, demonstration, of, brilliance, stirling, moss, about, schumacher, at, the, 1996, spanish, grand, prix, in, 1996, schumacher, finished, third, in, the, drivers, championship, and, helped, ferrari, to, second, place, in, the, constructors, championship, ahead, of, his, old, team, benetton, during, the, season, the, car, had, reliability, problems, schumacher, did, not, finish, in, 7, of, the, 16, races, at, the, french, grand, prix, schumacher, took, pole, position, but, suffered, engine, failure, on, the, formation, lap, he, won, three, races, more, than, the, team, s, total, tally, for, the, period, from, 1991, to, 1995, despite, a, poor, chassis, he, took, his, first, win, for, ferrari, at, the, spanish, grand, prix, where, he, lapped, the, entire, field, up, to, third, place, in, the, wet, after, a, bad, start, which, saw, him, dropping, from, third, to, sixth, place, before, taking, the, lead, on, lap, 19, he, consistently, lapped, five, seconds, faster, than, the, rest, of, the, field, in, the, difficult, conditions, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, he, used, well, timed, pit, stops, to, fend, off, williams, jacques, villeneuve, he, also, took, first, place, at, the, italian, grand, prix, to, win, in, front, of, the, tifosi, ferrari, fans, schumacher, and, villeneuve, competed, for, the, title, in, 1997, despite, never, sharing, a, podium, and, almost, never, battling, directly, on, the, track, in, what, has, been, described, as, the, sport, s, most, dramatic, and, controversial, season, finale, villeneuve, driving, the, superior, williams, fw19, led, the, championship, in, the, early, part, of, the, season, schumacher, first, win, of, the, season, came, at, the, wet, monaco, grand, prix, in, which, he, took, a, six, second, lead, after, one, lap, by, mid, season, despite, possibly, driving, not, even, the, second, fastest, car, on, the, grid, schumacher, had, taken, the, championship, lead, winning, five, races, and, entered, the, season, s, finale, the, european, grand, prix, at, the, jerez, circuit, with, a, one, point, advantage, in, qualifying, schumacher, set, the, same, fastest, lap, as, villeneuve, and, heinz, harald, frentzen, he, started, in, second, position, as, villeneuve, set, his, fastest, lap, first, but, was, able, to, jump, him, at, the, start, towards, the, end, of, the, race, schumacher, s, ferrari, developed, a, coolant, leak, and, loss, of, performance, indicating, he, might, not, finish, the, race, as, villeneuve, approached, to, pass, his, rival, on, lap, 48, schumacher, turned, in, on, him, but, retired, from, the, race, villeneuve, went, on, and, scored, four, points, to, take, the, championship, despite, public, outcry, the, race, stewards, did, not, initially, award, any, penalty, as, they, had, deemed, it, a, racing, incident, two, weeks, after, the, race, in, an, unprecedented, move, schumacher, was, disqualified, from, the, entire, 1997, drivers, championship, after, an, fia, disciplinary, hearing, found, that, his, manoeuvre, was, an, instinctive, reaction, and, although, deliberate, not, made, with, malice, or, premeditation, it, was, a, serious, error, initially, feeling, wronged, schumacher, accepted, the, decision, and, admitted, having, made, a, mistake, upon, seeing, the, footage, when, he, got, out, of, the, car, and, adrenaline, had, worn, off, his, actions, were, widely, condemned, in, british, german, and, italian, newspapers, another, view, is, that, villeneuve, went, into, the, corner, too, fast, without, schumacher, turning, into, him, he, would, have, overshot, the, turn, and, ended, up, in, the, gravel, in, later, years, villeneuve, himself, admitted, that, he, would, never, have, made, that, corner, without, push, and, schumacher, stated, in, 2009, that, if, he, could, have, his, career, over, again, he, would, do, some, things, differently, citing, jerez, 1997, as, something, that, he, would, have, changed, in, his, career, in, 1998, finnish, driver, mika, h, kkinen, became, schumacher, s, main, title, rival, driving, the, superior, mclaren, mp4, 13, h, kkinen, won, the, first, two, races, of, the, season, gaining, a, 16, point, advantage, over, schumacher, who, then, won, the, argentine, grand, prix, with, the, ferrari, improving, significantly, in, the, second, half, of, the, season, schumacher, took, six, victories, and, had, five, other, podium, finishes, one, of, his, victories, was, at, the, hungarian, grand, prix, a, track, where, overtaking, is, difficult, and, that, favoured, mclaren, schumacher, drove, 19, consecutive, qualifying, like, laps, to, make, ross, brawn, s, alternative, three, stop, strategy, work, and, to, go, from, third, to, first, place, brawn, had, told, him, michael, you, have, 19, laps, to, pull, out, 25, seconds, we, need, 19, qualifying, laps, from, you, schumacher, ultimately, came, 9, seconds, ahead, of, david, coulthard, h, kkinen, who, started, on, pole, achieved, only, a, point, due, to, reliability, issues, ferrari, took, a, 1, 2, finish, at, the, french, grand, prix, the, first, ferrari, 1, 2, finish, since, 1990, and, at, the, italian, grand, prix, which, tied, schumacher, with, h, kkinen, for, the, lead, of, the, drivers, championship, with, 80, points, there, were, two, controversies, during, the, 1998, season, at, the, british, grand, prix, schumacher, was, leading, on, the, last, lap, when, he, turned, into, the, pit, lane, crossed, the, start, finish, line, and, stopped, to, serve, his, ten, second, stop, go, penalty, which, was, a, result, of, overtaking, the, lapped, car, of, alexander, wurz, during, a, safety, car, period, there, was, some, doubt, whether, this, counted, as, serving, the, penalty, because, he, had, crossed, the, finish, line, when, he, came, into, the, pit, lane, the, win, was, valid, the, fia, rescinded, the, penalty, due, to, taking, 31, minutes, rather, than, within, the, 25, minutes, limit, and, rejected, mclaren, s, protest, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, schumacher, was, leading, the, race, by, 40, seconds, in, heavy, spray, but, collided, with, coulthard, s, mclaren, when, the, scot, a, lap, down, slowed, on, the, racing, line, in, poor, visibility, to, let, schumacher, past, his, ferrari, lost, a, wheel, but, could, return, to, the, pits, although, he, was, forced, to, retire, schumacher, leaped, out, of, his, car, and, headed, to, mclaren, s, garage, in, an, infuriated, manner, and, accused, coulthard, of, trying, to, kill, him, coulthard, admitted, five, years, later, that, the, accident, had, been, his, mistake, from, a, possible, three, point, lead, schumacher, was, still, seven, points, behind, h, kkinen, heading, into, the, final, race, the, japanese, grand, prix, h, kkinen, held, a, four, point, advantage, over, schumacher, who, started, on, pole, but, stalled, and, caused, the, start, to, be, aborted, which, meant, he, had, to, start, from, the, back, of, the, field, he, made, a, comeback, up, to, third, but, retired, after, hitting, debris, from, an, accident, h, kkinen, won, the, drivers, championship, by, winning, the, final, two, races, despite, schumacher, being, the, polesitter, both, times, continuing, ferrari, s, longest, world, championship, drought, in, 1999, schumacher, s, efforts, helped, ferrari, win, the, constructors, championship, the, team, s, first, title, since, 1983, he, lost, his, chance, to, win, the, drivers, championship, at, the, british, grand, prix, at, the, high, speed, stowe, corner, his, car, s, rear, brake, failed, sending, him, off, the, track, into, the, barriers, and, resulting, in, a, broken, leg, during, his, 98, day, absence, he, was, replaced, by, finnish, driver, mika, salo, about, his, return, schumacher, s, eddie, irvine, teammate, recalled, it, was, amazing, i, remember, me, and, mika, salo, were, testing, at, mugello, which, is, one, of, the, hardest, circuits, in, the, world, and, he, hadn, t, driven, for, eight, months, he, got, in, the, car, and, within, a, lap, he, was, a, tenth, or, two, tenths, slower, than, i, was, how, do, you, do, that, and, then, of, course, a, couple, of, laps, later, he, s, half, a, second, quicker, and, it, s, just, impossible, it, s, really, really, annoying, but, it, was, an, honour, to, be, able, to, see, his, telemetry, and, see, the, things, he, could, do, with, a, car, after, missing, six, races, he, made, his, return, at, the, inaugural, malaysian, grand, prix, qualifying, in, pole, position, with, his, career, s, greatest, pole, margin, with, his, time, faster, than, eddie, irvine, by, almost, a, second, he, then, assumed, the, role, of, second, driver, helping, irvine, to, victory, and, assisting, his, teammate, s, bid, to, win, the, drivers, championship, for, ferrari, with, irvine, leading, the, championship, by, one, point, about, schumacher, s, role, irvine, stated, he, is, not, only, the, best, driver, in, the, world, he, is, also, the, best, number, two, in, the, world, in, the, last, race, of, the, season, the, japanese, grand, prix, h, kkinen, won, his, second, consecutive, title, after, he, beat, him, off, the, line, schumacher, later, said, that, h, kkinen, was, the, best, opponent, i, ve, had, and, the, one, he, respected, the, most, in, 2000, schumacher, won, his, third, drivers, championship, his, first, with, ferrari, after, a, year, long, battle, with, h, kkinen, schumacher, won, the, first, three, races, of, the, season, and, five, of, the, first, eight, midway, through, the, year, schumacher, s, chances, suffered, with, three, consecutive, non, finishes, allowing, h, kkinen, to, close, the, gap, in, the, standings, at, the, german, grand, prix, qualifying, session, which, was, largely, decided, in, the, opening, 10, minutes, of, semi, dry, weather, schumacher, was, able, to, improve, his, time, in, the, final, seconds, and, qualified, second, in, the, race, he, retired, after, crashing, out, at, the, start, as, his, new, teammate, rubens, barrichello, took, his, maiden, win, from, 18th, h, kkinen, then, took, another, two, victories, before, schumacher, won, at, the, italian, grand, prix, his, 41st, career, win, at, the, post, race, press, conference, after, equalling, the, number, of, wins, won, by, his, idol, ayrton, senna, schumacher, broke, into, tears, the, championship, fight, came, down, to, the, penultimate, race, of, the, season, the, japanese, grand, prix, starting, from, pole, position, schumacher, lost, the, lead, to, h, kkinen, at, the, start, after, his, second, pit, stop, schumacher, came, out, ahead, of, h, kkinen, and, went, on, to, win, the, race, and, the, drivers, championship, he, later, described, it, as, the, fight, of, his, life, although, schumacher, won, more, than, twice, as, many, grands, prix, as, h, kkinen, bbc, sport, journalist, andrew, benson, stated, that, the, challenge, from, mika, hakkinen, and, mclaren, mercedes, was, far, stronger, than, the, raw, statistics, suggest, and, that, the, adrian, newey, designed, mclaren, was, the, fastest, car, in, f1, for, the, third, straight, year, benson, also, hailed, schumacher, as, unquestionably, the, greatest, driver, of, his, era, in, 2001, schumacher, took, his, fourth, drivers, title, four, other, drivers, won, races, but, none, sustained, a, season, long, challenge, for, the, championship, schumacher, scored, a, record, tying, nine, wins, and, clinched, the, world, championship, with, four, races, yet, to, run, he, finished, the, championship, with, 123, points, 58, ahead, of, runner, up, coulthard, season, highlights, included, the, spanish, grand, prix, where, he, won, after, h, kkinen, retired, on, the, last, lap, due, to, his, car, s, engine, blowing, up, leading, schumacher, to, say, he, was, sorry, for, him, and, that, they, had, been, bloody, lucky, canadian, grand, prix, where, schumacher, finished, second, to, his, brother, ralf, thus, scoring, the, first, ever, 1, 2, finish, by, brothers, in, formula, one, and, the, belgian, grand, prix, in, which, schumacher, scored, his, 52nd, career, win, breaking, alain, prost, s, record, for, most, career, wins, that, had, stood, since, 1993, in, 2002, schumacher, retained, his, drivers, championship, in, winning, the, drivers, championship, he, equalled, the, record, set, by, juan, manuel, fangio, of, five, world, championships, ferrari, won, 15, out, of, 17, races, and, schumacher, won, the, title, with, six, races, remaining, in, the, season, which, is, still, the, earliest, point, in, the, season, for, a, driver, to, be, crowned, world, champion, schumacher, broke, his, own, record, shared, with, nigel, mansell, of, nine, race, wins, in, a, season, by, winning, 11, times, and, finishing, every, race, on, the, podium, he, finished, with, 144, points, a, record, breaking, 67, points, ahead, of, the, runner, up, his, teammate, barrichello, this, pair, finished, nine, of, the, 17, races, in, the, first, two, places, during, the, 2002, season, there, was, some, controversy, at, the, austrian, grand, prix, where, barrichello, was, leading, but, in, the, final, metres, of, the, race, under, team, orders, slowed, down, to, allow, schumacher, to, win, the, race, although, the, switching, of, positions, did, not, break, any, actual, sporting, or, technical, regulation, as, ferrari, did, the, same, at, the, austrian, grand, prix, the, previous, year, where, schumacher, finishe, second, and, barrichello, third, it, angered, fans, and, it, was, claimed, that, the, team, s, actions, showed, a, lack, of, sportsmanship, and, respect, to, the, spectators, many, argued, that, schumacher, did, not, need, to, be, given, wins, in, only, the, sixth, race, of, the, season, which, he, would, have, won, anyway, a, view, also, shared, by, jean, todt, and, ross, brawn, in, retrospect, particularly, given, that, he, had, already, won, four, of, the, previous, five, grands, prix, and, that, barrichello, had, dominated, the, race, weekend, up, to, that, point, at, the, podium, ceremony, schumacher, pushed, barrichello, onto, the, top, step, and, the, ferrari, team, incurred, a, 1, million, fine, for, this, disturbance, schumacher, vowed, to, pay, back, barrichello, and, later, that, same, year, returned, the, favour, in, several, races, to, help, him, finish, second, in, the, standings, at, the, united, states, grand, prix, schumacher, returned, the, favour, by, giving, barrichello, the, win, by, 0, 011, seconds, the, second, closest, margin, on, the, finishing, line, in, formula, one, history, in, a, failed, dead, heat, finish, in, an, unplanned, finish, schumacher, s, explanation, varied, between, it, being, him, returning, the, favour, for, austria, or, trying, to, engineer, a, formation, finish, a, feat, derided, as, near, impossible, in, a, sport, where, timings, are, taken, to, within, a, thousandth, of, a, second, after, the, end, of, the, season, the, fia, banned, team, orders, which, interfere, with, the, race, result, the, ban, was, lifted, for, the, 2011, season, because, the, ruling, was, difficult, to, enforce, schumacher, broke, fangio, s, 46, year, record, of, five, drivers, championships, by, winning, the, drivers, title, for, the, sixth, time, in, 2003, after, a, closely, contested, battle, with, his, main, rivals, which, was, also, a, result, of, lobbying, regarding, the, michelin, tyres, before, the, season, started, the, fia, introduced, new, regulations, and, a, new, points, system, to, make, the, championship, more, open, the, biggest, competition, came, from, the, mclaren, mercedes, and, williams, bmw, teams, in, the, first, race, schumacher, was, run, off, track, and, he, was, involved, in, collisions, in, the, following, two, he, fell, 16, points, behind, mclaren, s, kimi, r, ikk, nen, despite, the, death, of, his, mother, elisabeth, just, hours, before, the, race, schumacher, won, the, san, marino, grand, prix, despite, being, losing, the, first, position, into, turn, one, he, also, won, the, next, two, races, and, closed, within, two, points, of, r, ikk, nen, aside, from, schumacher, s, victory, at, the, canadian, grand, prix, and, barrichello, s, victory, at, the, british, grand, prix, the, mid, season, was, dominated, by, williams, drivers, ralf, schumacher, and, juan, pablo, montoya, who, each, claimed, two, victories, after, the, hungarian, grand, prix, schumacher, led, montoya, and, r, ikk, nen, by, only, one, and, two, points, respectively, ahead, of, the, next, race, the, fia, announced, changes, to, the, way, tyre, widths, were, to, be, measured, this, forced, michelin, supplier, to, williams, and, mclaren, among, others, to, rapidly, redesign, their, tyres, before, the, italian, grand, prix, schumacher, running, on, bridgestone, tyres, won, the, next, two, races, after, montoya, was, penalised, in, the, united, states, grand, prix, only, schumacher, and, r, ikk, nen, remained, in, contention, for, the, title, at, the, final, round, the, japanese, grand, prix, schumacher, needed, only, one, point, whilst, r, ikk, nen, needed, to, win, by, finishing, the, race, in, eighth, place, schumacher, took, one, point, and, assured, his, sixth, drivers, title, ending, the, season, two, points, ahead, of, r, ikk, nen, in, 2004, schumacher, won, a, record, 12, of, the, first, 13, races, of, the, season, including, the, inaugural, bahrain, grand, prix, and, the, japanese, grand, prix, only, failing, to, finish, in, monaco, after, an, accident, with, montoya, during, a, safety, car, period, in, august, 2004, schumacher, s, win, at, the, hungarian, grand, prix, contributed, to, ferrari, s, sixth, consecutive, constructors, championship, and, he, later, clinched, a, seventh, drivers, championship, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, earlier, in, july, at, the, french, grand, prix, schumacher, beat, polesitter, fernando, alonso, with, a, four, stop, strategy, he, finished, the, season, with, a, record, 148, points, 34, points, ahead, of, the, runner, up, barrichello, and, set, a, new, record, of, 13, race, wins, out, of, a, possible, 18, surpassing, his, previous, best, of, 11, wins, from, the, 2002, season, between, 2000, and, 2004, schumacher, achieved, five, drivers, championships, 48, wins, and, almost, all, formula, one, records, with, his, fifth, drivers, championship, in, a, row, he, also, broke, fangio, s, record, of, consecutive, titles, that, had, stood, for, nearly, fifty, years, rule, changes, for, the, 2005, season, required, tyres, to, last, an, entire, race, tipping, the, overall, advantage, to, teams, using, michelins, over, teams, like, ferrari, that, relied, on, bridgestone, tyres, the, rule, changes, were, partly, in, an, effort, to, dent, ferrari, s, dominance, and, make, the, series, more, interesting, the, most, notable, moment, of, the, early, season, for, schumacher, was, his, battle, with, renault, r25, driver, fernando, alonso, at, the, san, marino, grand, prix, where, he, started, 13th, and, finished, only, 0, 2, seconds, behind, alonso, less, than, halfway, through, the, season, schumacher, stated, i, don, t, think, i, can, count, myself, in, this, battle, any, more, it, was, like, trying, to, fight, with, a, blunted, weapon, if, your, weapons, are, weak, you, don, t, have, a, chance, schumacher, s, sole, win, in, 2005, came, at, the, united, states, grand, prix, in, a, 1, 2, finish, with, rubens, barrichello, before, that, race, the, michelin, tyres, were, found, to, have, significant, safety, issues, when, no, compromise, between, the, teams, and, the, fia, could, be, reached, all, but, the, three, teams, using, bridgestone, tyres, dropped, out, of, the, race, after, the, formation, lap, leaving, only, six, drivers, on, the, grid, schumacher, retired, in, 6, of, the, 19, races, and, finished, the, season, in, third, with, 62, points, fewer, than, half, the, points, of, world, champion, alonso, 2006, became, the, last, season, of, schumacher, s, ferrari, career, after, three, races, schumacher, had, just, 11, points, and, was, already, 17, points, behind, alonso, he, won, the, following, two, races, his, pole, position, at, san, marino, grand, prix, was, his, 66th, breaking, ayrton, senna, s, 12, year, old, record, which, was, described, as, perhaps, the, greatest, record, that, stood, in, the, sport, and, was, a, reversal, of, the, 2005, race, schumacher, was, stripped, of, pole, position, at, the, monaco, grand, prix, and, started, the, race, at, the, back, of, the, grid, as, he, stopped, his, car, and, blocked, part, of, the, circuit, while, alonso, was, on, his, qualifying, lap, he, still, managed, to, work, his, way, up, to, fifth, place, on, the, notoriously, cramped, monaco, circuit, before, the, turkish, grand, prix, the, fourteenth, race, of, the, season, the, fia, banned, renault, s, mass, damper, with, the, superior, renault, r26, suddenly, no, longer, as, competitive, by, the, canadian, grand, prix, the, ninth, race, of, the, season, schumacher, was, 25, points, behind, alonso, he, then, won, the, following, three, races, including, at, hockenheim, to, reduce, his, disadvantage, to, 11, and, to, 10, by, turkey, since, canada, ferrari, won, six, out, of, seven, races, including, at, monza, with, schumacher, winning, in, five, of, them, after, further, victories, at, the, italian, grand, prix, where, he, announced, his, retirement, at, the, end, of, the, season, and, at, the, chinese, grand, prix, in, what, would, be, his, 91th, and, final, career, win,

from, racing, at, the, end, of, the, 2006, season, but, would, continue, working, for, the, team, the, tifosi, and, the, italian, press, who, did, not, always, take, to, schumacher, s, relatively, cold, public, persona, displayed, an, affectionate, response, after, he, announced, his, retirement, after, qualifying, second, schumacher, led, the, japanese, grand, prix, in, what, could, have, seen, him, heading, into, the, season, finale, with, two, points, ahead, of, alonso, with, only, 16, laps, to, go, his, car, suffered, an, engine, failure, for, the, first, time, since, the, french, grand, prix, ending, a, 58, race, sequence, without, a, mechanical, retirement, handing, alonso, the, victory, he, also, conceded, the, title, to, win, the, drivers, championship, schumacher, would, have, had, to, win, the, final, race, and, alonso, had, to, fail, to, score, any, point, and, he, did, not, wish, to, win, the, title, like, that, during, the, pre, race, ceremonies, of, the, season,

he, had, the, pace, to, win, the, race, by, a, lap, and, was, variously, classified, in, the, press, as, heroic, an, utterly, breath, taking, drive, and, a, performance, that, sums, up, his, career, at, the, time, schumacher, s, 91, wins, were, 40, more, than, alain, prost, who, was, his, nearest, rival, schumacher, held, at, least, thirty, one, records, including, for, most, championship,

the, european, grand, prix, and, subsequent, grands, prix, until, massa, was, able, to, race, again, schumacher, tested, a, modified, ferrari, f2007, to, prepare, himself, as, he, had, been, unable, to, test, the, ferrari, f60, due, to, testing, restrictions, ferrari, appealed, for, special, permission, for, schumacher, to, test, in, a, 2009, season, spec, car, williams, red, bull, and, toro, rosso, were, against, this, test, in, the, end, schumacher, was, forced, to, call, off, his, return, due, to, the, severity, of, the, neck, injury, he, had, received, in, a, motorcycle, accident, earlier, in, the, year, instead, massa, s, place, was, first, filled, by, luca, badoer, and, later, on, by, giancarlo, fisichella, schumacher, described, this, aborted, return, to, formula, one, as, his, toughest, moment, he, played, a, crucial, role, when, we, re, joined, f1, and, was, one, of, the, people, who, laid, the, foundation, for, our, future, success, we, re, extremely, grateful, for, everything, he, did, for, us, mercedes, team, principal, toto, wolff, about, schumacher, s, influence, on, the, mercedes, team, in, december, 2009, schumacher, announced, his, return, to, formula, one, for, the, 2010, season, alongside, fellow, german, driver, and, 24, years, old, nico, rosberg, in, the, new, mercedes, gp, team, the, 2009, season, had, ended, with, brawn, gp, taking, over, from, honda, winning, both, titles, after, winning, six, of, the, first, seven, races, for, the, 2010, season, mercedes, returned, to, the, sport, as, a, constructor, for, the, first, time, since, 1955, and, schumacher, rejoined, team, principal, ross, brawn, who, was, behind, all, of, his, seven, world, championships, schumacher, stated, that, his, preparations, to, replace, the, injured, massa, had, initiated, a, renewed, interest, in, formula, one, which, combined, with, the, opportunity, to, fulfil, a, long, held, ambition, to, drive, for, mercedes, and, to, be, working, again, with, team, principal, ross, brawn, led, schumacher, to, accept, the, offer, once, he, was, passed, fit, schumacher, signed, a, three, year, contract, reportedly, worth, 20, million, schumacher, s, comeback, was, the, most, high, profile, in, formula, one, since, niki, lauda, came, out, of, a, two, year, retirement, for, the, 1982, season, to, race, for, mclaren, and, went, on, to, win, a, third, world, title, in, 1984, he, turned, 41, in, 2010, the, same, age, nigel, mansell, won, the, 1994, australian, grand, prix, after, having, stepped, in, as, a, substitute, following, the, death, of, ayrton, senna, and, his, prospects, with, mercedes, were, compared, with, nigel, mansell, who, had, won, a, title, at, 39, and, last, competed, aged, 41, damon, hill, who, competed, his, final, season, at, 39, and, juan, manuel, fangio, formula, one, s, oldest, champion, who, was, 46, when, he, won, his, fifth, title, although, schumacher, ultimately, did, not, win, any, race, or, title, his, conduct, during, his, comeback, was, for, the, most, part, with, humility, and, dignity, even, as, fans, and, pundits, criticised, schumacher, s, lack, of, pace, wailed, for, him, to, stop, and, argued, that, he, should, never, have, come, back, in, the, first, place, in, the, three, seasons, before, he, retired, again, schumacher, finished, ninth, eighth, and, 13th, in, the, standings, led, three, laps, and, notched, one, podium, over, 58, races, despite, a, difficult, start, which, included, adaptation, to, significant, different, regulations, and, new, pirelli, tyres, as, well, as, rust, and, being, bested, by, his, teammate, he, improved, in, the, next, two, years, where, he, arguably, outraced, rosberg, but, bad, luck, and, mechanical, failures, did, not, reflect, it, at, the, standings, speaking, to, the, bbc, in, december, 2009, he, said, i, want, to, have, fun, out, there, and, i, feel, as, fresh, as, ever, i, ve, recharged, myself, after, a, three, year, break, the, challenge, is, what, i, look, for, i, want, to, know, it, it, has, been, argued, that, it, was, his, 2009, motorcycle, accident, the, reason, why, the, comeback, was, not, successful, in, the, words, of, mark, hughes, i, believe, his, motorcycle, accident, and, the, damaged, neurons, from, a, neck, injury, that, in, 90, per, cent, of, cases, is, fatal, was, probably, more, responsible, for, his, lack, of, form, second, time, around, than, age, or, length, of, absence, after, having, impressed, in, the, free, practices, schumacher, finished, sixth, in, the, first, race, of, the, season, at, the, bahrain, grand, prix, 1, 239, days, after, his, previous, formula, one, race, he, finished, behind, teammate, nico, rosberg, in, each, of, the, first, four, qualifying, sessions, and, races, former, driver, stirling, moss, suggested, that, schumacher, might, be, past, it, several, other, former, formula, one, drivers, thought, otherwise, including, former, rival, damon, hill, who, warned, you, should, never, write, schumacher, off, grandprix, com, identified, the, inherent, understeer, of, the, mercedes, car, exacerbated, by, the, narrower, front, tyres, introduced, for, the, 2010, season, as, contributing, to, schumacher, s, difficulties, jenson, button, would, later, claim, that, mercedes, s, car, was, designed, for, him, as, he, would, initially, drive, for, the, team, and, that, their, differing, driving, styles, may, have, contributed, to, schumacher, s, difficulties, mercedes, upgraded, their, car, for, the, spanish, grand, prix, where, schumacher, finished, fourth, at, the, monaco, grand, prix, schumacher, finished, sixth, after, passing, ferrari, s, fernando, alonso, on, the, final, corner, before, the, finish, line, when, the, safety, car, returned, to, the, pits, mercedes, held, that, the, combination, of, the, race, control, messages, safety, car, in, this, lap, and, track, clear, and, the, green, flags, and, lights, shown, by, the, marshals, after, safety, car, line, one, indicated, that, the, race, was, not, finishing, under, the, safety, car, and, all, drivers, were, free, to, race, an, fia, investigation, found, schumacher, guilty, of, breaching, safety, car, regulations, and, awarded, him, a, 20, seconds, penalty, dropping, him, to, 12th, in, doing, so, the, fia, sought, to, clarify, the, regulations, post, race, as, the, new, and, old, rules, appeared, to, be, in, conflict, at, the, turkish, grand, prix, schumacher, qualified, fifth, and, finished, fourth, in, the, race, both, his, best, results, since, his, return, at, the, european, grand, prix, in, valencia, schumacher, finished, 15th, the, lowest, recorded, finish, in, his, career, at, the, hungarian, grand, prix, rubens, barrichello, attempted, to, pass, schumacher,

demoted, ten, places, on, the, grid, for, the, following, race, the, belgian, grand, prix, where, he, finished, seventh, despite, starting, 21st, after, his, grid, penalty, at, the, abu, dhabi, grand,

season, in, ninth, place, with, 72, points, for, the, first, time, since, 1991, schumacher, finished, a, year, without, a, win, pole, position, podium, or, fastest, lap, after, starting, the, 2011,

place, at, the, canadian, grand, prix, after, running, as, high, as, second, in, a, wet, race, his, canadian, race, was, seen, at, the, time, as, his, most, convincing, performance, since, he, came, out, of, retirement, despite, starting, last, at, the, belgian, grand, prix, twenty, years, after, his, debut, schumacher, finished, fifth, the, japanese, grand, prix, saw, schumacher, lead, three, laps, during, the, race, marking, the, first, time, he, had, led, a, race, since, 2006, in, doing, so, he, became, the, oldest, driver, to, lead, a, race, since, jack, brabham, in, 1970, schumacher,

after, starting, 13th, schumacher, s, indecision, over, his, future, plans, led, to, him, being, replaced, by, lewis, hamilton, at, mercedes, for, the, 2013, season, in, october, 2012, days, before, the, japanese, grand, prix, schumacher, announced, he, would, retire, for, a, second, time, stating, there, were, times, in, the, past, few, months, in, which, i, didn, t, want, to, deal, with, formula, one, or, prepare, for, the, next, grand, prix, in, what, would, be, his, 308th, and, last, entry, and, 306th, race, start, schumacher, concluded, the, season, with, a, seventh, place, finish, at, the, brazilian, grand, prix, which, was, also, the, position, he, started, his, first, formula, one, race, during, the, race, he, symbolically, pulled, over, for, fellow, german, sebastian, vettel, en, route, to, his, then, third, drivers, championship, schumacher, never, won, a, race, and, never, finished, higher, than, eighth, in, the, overall, formula, one, standings, during, his, comeback, placing, 13th, in, the, 2012, drivers, championship, and, closed, his, career, with, 91, wins, 155, podiums, and, 68, pole, positions, which, at, the, time, were, all, records, before, it, was, surpassed, by, hamilton, in, 2020, schumacher, s, 91, wins, were, one, short, of, the, combined, win, totals, of, ayrton, senna, and, alain, prost, as, of, 2019, only, 81, drivers, in, the, history, of, the, formula, one, world, championship, had, started, more, races, than, he, won, although, schumacher, did, not, win, any, race, or, title, at, mercedes, gp, which, then, went, on, to, win, a, record, breaking, of, schumacher, s, ferrari, from, 1999, to, 2004, eight, constructors, championships, under, hamilton, rosberg, and, valtteri, bottas, from, 2014, to, 2021, ross, brawn, said, that, michael, s, contribution, to, our, development, and, the, future, of, our, team, has, been, significant, and, observed, in, my, opinion, he, is, the, greatest, formula, one, driver, and, the, records, which, he, holds, in, our, sport, speak, volumes, for, his, success, and, commitment, schumacher, in, conjunction, with, schuberth, helped, develop, the, first, lightweight, carbon,

astroids, from, the, 2000, monaco, grand, prix, in, order, to, differentiate, his, colours, from, his, new, teammate, rubens, barrichello, whose, helmet, was, predominantly, white, with, a, blue, circle, on, top, and, a, red, ellipsis, surrounding, the, visor, schumacher, changed, the, upper, blue, colour, and, some, of, the, white, areas, to, red, for, the, 2006, brazilian, grand, prix, he,

a, commemorative, gold, leafed, helmet, which, included, the, year, of, his, debut, and, the, seasons, of, his, seven, drivers, titles, during, his, 300th, grand, prix, appearance, at, the, 2012, belgian, grand, prix, schumacher, wore, a, platinum, leafed, helmet, with, a, message, of, his, achievement, schumacher, s, career, spanned, three, decades, or, twenty, three, years, and, left, a, lasting, impact, on, the, sport, formula, one, in, particular, but, also, motorsport, as, a, whole, and, his, influence, extended, beyond, his, own, racing, career, by, the, time, of, his, first, retirement, in, 2006, and, his, final, retirement, in, 2012, schumacher, was, widely, considered, among, the, greatest, formula, one, drivers, a, trend, that, continued, into, the, 2020s, several, commentators, and, drivers, including, among, others, multi, time, world, champions, niki, lauda, and, sebastian, vettel, former, rival, david, coulthard, former, formula, one, driver, giancarlo, fisichella, and, mercedes, team, bosses, ross, brawn, and, toto, wolff, have, at, times, described, him, as, the, greatest, of, his, era, and, the, greatest, of, all, time, schumacher, was, the, sport, s, most, dominant, force, in, the, 2000s, being, described, as, statistically, the, most, successful, driver, in, formula, one, history, and, the, most, complete, formula, one, driver, ever, by, 2004, schumacher, came, to, held, most, major, formula, one, records, and, by, 2006, his, name, was, inscribed, in, almost, all, of, formula, one, s, record, books, including, for, most, world, championships, 7, most, wins, 91, most, podiums, 155, most, pole, positions, 68, and, most, fastest, laps, 77, the, latter, a, record, he, still, holds, although, several, of, his, records, were, later, equalled, or, beaten, such, as, the, most, wins, in, a, season, at, 13, a, record, he, first, broke, in, 1995, and, then, equalled, in, 2000, and, 2001, and, further, improved, in, 2002, and, 2004, by, multiple, time, world, champions, like, vettel, lewis, hamilton, and, max, verstappen, others, remain, his, such, as, his, 100, percent, podium, finish, in, 2002, 17, which, included,
