into, the, red, eye, the, cauldron, of, morning, from, the, poem, ariel, october, 12, 1962, the, posthumous, publication, of, ariel, in, 1965, precipitated, plath, s, rise, to, fame, the, poems, in, ariel, mark, a, departure, from, her, earlier, work, into, a, more, personal, arena, of, poetry, robert, lowell, s, poetry, may, have, played, a, part, in, this, shift, as, she, cited, lowell, s, 1959, book, life, studies, as, a, significant, influence, in, an, interview, just, before, her, death, the, impact, of, ariel, was, dramatic, with, its, dark, and, potentially, autobiographical, descriptions, of, mental, illness, in, poems, such, as, tulips, daddy, and, lady, lazarus, plath, s, work, is, often, held, within, the, genre, of, confessional, poetry, and, the, style, of, her, work, compared, to, other, contemporaries, such, as, lowell, and, w, d, snodgrass, plath, s, close, friend, al, alvarez, who, wrote, about, her, extensively, said, of, her, later, work, plath, s, case, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, in, her, mature, work, she, deliberately, used, the, details, of, her, everyday, life, as, raw, material, for, her, art, a, casual, visitor, or, unexpected, telephone, call, a, cut, a, bruise, a, kitchen, bowl, a, candlestick, everything, became, usable, charged, with, meaning, transformed, her, poems, are, full, of, references, and, images, that, seem, impenetrable, at, this, distance, but, which, could, mostly, be, explained, in, footnotes, by, a, scholar, with, full, access, to, the, details, of, her, life, many, of, plath, s, later, poems, deal, with, what, one, critic, calls, the, domestic, surreal, in, which, plath, takes, everyday, elements, of, life, and, twists, the, images, giving, them, an, almost, nightmarish, quality, plath, s, poem, morning, song, from, ariel, is, regarded, as, one, of, her, finest, poems, on, freedom, of, expression, of, an, artist, plath, s, fellow, confessional, poet, and, friend, anne, sexton, commented, sylvia, and, i, would, talk, at, length, about, our, first, suicide, in, detail, and, in, depth, between, the, free, potato, chips, suicide, is, after, all, the, opposite, of, the, poem, sylvia, and, i, often, talked, opposites, we, talked, death, with, burned, up, intensity, both, of, us, drawn, to, it, like, moths, to, an, electric, lightbulb, sucking, on, it, she, told, the, story, of, her, first, suicide, in, sweet, and, loving, detail, and, her, description, in, the, bell, jar, is, just, that, same, story, the, confessional, interpretation, of, plath, s, work, has, led, to, some, dismissing, certain, aspects, of, her, work, as, an, exposition, of, sentimentalist, melodrama, in, 2010, for, example, theodore, dalrymple, asserted, that, plath, had, been, the, patron, saint, of, self, dramatisation, and, of, self, pity, revisionist, critics, such, as, tracy, brain, have, however, argued, against, a, tightly, autobiographical, interpretation, of, plath, s, material, on, january, 16, 2004, the, independent, newspaper, in, london, published, an, article, that, ranked, ariel, as, the, 3rd, best, book, of, modern, poetry, among, the, 10, best, modern, poetry, books, in,

statesman, fellow, poet, peter, porter, wrote, crossing, the, water, is, full, of, perfectly, realised, works, its, most, striking, impression, is, of, a, front, rank, artist, in, the, process, of, discovering, her, true, power, such, is, plath, s, control, that, the, book, possesses, a, singularity, and, certainty, which, should, make, it, as, celebrated, as, the, colossus, or, ariel, the,

fetuses, and, skulls, they, were, mostly, imitation, exercises, of, poets, she, admired, such, as, dylan, thomas, w, b, yeats, and, marianne, moore, late, in, 1959, when, she, and, hughes, were, at,
