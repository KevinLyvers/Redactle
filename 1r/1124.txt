the, office, of, chief, inspector, of, accountability, muslims, remained, in, peace, in, medina, for, approximately, a, year, before, the, quraish, raised, an, army, to, attack, them, in, 624, umar, participated, in, the, first, battle, between, muslims, and, quraish, of, mecca, i, e, the, battle, of, badr, in, 625, he, took, part, in, the, battle, of, uhud, in, the, second, phase, of, the, battle, when, khalid, ibn, walid, s, cavalry, attacked, the, muslim, rear, turning, the, tide, of, battle, rumours, of, muhammad, s, death, were, spread, and, many, muslim, warriors, were, routed, from, the, battlefield, umar, among, them, however, hearing, that, muhammad, was, still, alive, he, went, to, muhammad, at, the, mountain, of, uhud, and, prepared, for, the, defence, of, the, hill, later, in, the, year, umar, was, a, part, of, a, campaign, against, the, jewish, tribe, of, banu, nadir, in, 625, umar, s, daughter, hafsah, was, married, to, muhammad, later, in, 627, he,

khaybar, in, 629, muhammad, sent, amr, ibn, al, a, as, to, zaat, ul, sallasal, after, which, muhammad, sent, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, with, reinforcements, including, abu, bakr, and, umar, whereupon, they, attacked, and, defeated, the, enemy, in, 630, when, muslim, armies, rushed, for, the, conquest, of, mecca, he, was, part, of, that, army, later, in, 630, he, fought, in, the, battle, of, hunayn, and, the, siege, of, ta, if, he, was, part, of, the, muslim, army, that, contested, the, battle, of, tabouk, under, muhammad, s, command, and, he, was, reported, to, have, given, half, of, his, wealth, for, the, preparation, of, this, expedition, he, also, participated, in, the, farewell, hajj, of, muhammad, in, 632, when, muhammad, died, on, 8, june, 632, umar, initially, disbelieved, that, he, was, dead, it, is, said, that, umar, promised, to, strike, the, head, of, any, man, who, would, say, that, muhammad, died, umar, said, he, has, not, died, but, rather, he, has, gone, to, his, lord, just, as, moses, went, remaining, absent, from, his, people, for, forty, nights, after, which, he, has, returned, to, them, by, allah, the, messenger, of, allah, will, indeed, return, just, as, moses, returned, to, his, people, and, he, will, cut, off, the, hands, and, legs, of, those, men, who, claimed, he, has, died, abu, bakr, then, publicly, spoke, to, the, community, in, the, mosque, saying, whoever, worshiped, muhammad, let, them, know, that, muhammad, has, died, and, whoever, worshiped, allah, let, them, know, that, allah, is, alive, and, never, dies, ab, bakr, then, recited, these, verses, from, the, qur, an, 3, 144, muhammad, is, but, a, messenger, messengers, the, like, of, whom, have, passed, away, before, him, if, then, he, dies, or, is, killed, will, you, turn, back, on, your, heel, hearing, this, umar, fell, on, his, knees, in, sorrow, and, acceptance, sunni, muslims, say, that, this, denial, of, muhammad, s, death, was, occasioned, by, his, deep, love, for, him, umar, s, political, capacity, first, manifested, as, the, architect, of, the, caliphate, after, muhammad, died, on, 8, june, 632, while, the, funeral, of, muhammad, was, being, arranged, a, group, of, muhammad, s, followers, who, were, natives, of, medina, the, ansar, helpers, organised, a, meeting, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, effectively, locking, out, those, companions, known, as, muhajirs, the, emigrants, including, umar, umar, found, out, about, this, meeting, at, saqifah, bani, saadah, and, taking, with, him, two, other, muhajirs, abu, bakr, and, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, proceeded, to, the, meeting, presumably, to, head, off, the, ansars, plans, for, political, separation, arriving, at, the, meeting, umar, was, faced, with, a, unified, community, of, tribes, from, the, ansar, who, refused, to, accept, the, leadership, of, the, muhajirs, however, umar, was, undeterred, in, his, belief, the, caliphate, should, be, under, the, control, of, the, muhajirs, though, the, khazraj, were, in, disagreement, umar, after, strained, negotiations, lasting, one, or, two, days, brilliantly, divided, the, ansar, into, their, old, warring, factions, of, aws, and, khazraj, tribes, umar, resolved, the, divisions, by, placing, his, hand, on, that, of, abu, bakr, as, a, unity, candidate, for, those, gathered, in, the, saqifah, others, at, the, saqifah, followed, suit, with, the, exception, of, the, khazraj, tribe, and, their, leader, sa, d, ibn, ubada, who, were, ostracized, as, a, result, the, khazraj, tribe, is, said, to, have, posed, no, significant, threat, as, there, were, sufficient, men, of, war, from, the, medinan, tribes, such, as, the, banu, aws, to, immediately, organize, them, into, a, military, bodyguard, for, abu, bakr, wilferd, madelung, summarises, umar, s, contribution, umar, judged, the, outcome, of, the, saqifa, assembly, to, be, a, falta, because, of, the, absence, of, most, of, the, prominent, muhajirun, including, the, prophet, s, own, family, and, clan, whose, participation, he, considered, vital, for, any, legitimate, consultation, shura, mashwara, it, was, he, warned, the, community, to, be, no, precedent, for, the, future, yet, he, also, defended, the, outcome, claiming, that, the, muslims, were, longing, for, abu, bakr, as, for, no, one, else, he, apologized, moreover, that, the, muhajirun, present, were, forced, to, press, for, an, immediate, oath, of, allegiance, since, the, ansar, could, not, have, been, trusted, to, wait, for, a, legitimate, consultation, and, might, have, proceeded, to, elect, one, of, their, own, after, the, departure, of, the, mekkans, another, reason, for, umar, to, censure, the, saqifa, meeting, as, a, falta, was, no, doubt, its, turbulent, and, undignified, end, as, he, and, his, followers, jumped, upon, the, sick, khazraji, leader, sa, d, bin, ubada, in, order, to, teach, him, a, lesson, if, not, to, kill, him, for, daring, to, challenge, the, sole, right, of, quraysh, to, rule, this, violent, break, up, of, the, meeting, indicates, moreover, that, the, ansar, cannot, all, have, been, swayed, by, the, wisdom, and, eloquence, of, abu, bakr, s, speech, and, have, accepted, him, as, the, best, choice, for, the, succession, as, suggested, by, caetani, there, would, have, been, no, sense, in, beating, up, the, khazraji, chief, if, everybody, had, come, around, to, swearing, allegiance, to, umar, s, candidate, a, substantial, number, of, the, ansar, presumably, of, khazraj, in, particular, must, have, refused, to, follow, the, lead, of, the, muhajirun, according, to, various, twelver, shia, sources, and, madelung, umar, and, abu, bakr, had, in, effect, mounted, a, political, coup, against, ali, at, the, saqifah, according, to, one, version, of, narrations, in, primary, sources, umar, and, abu, bakr, are, also, said, to, have, used, force, to, try, to, secure, the, allegiance, from, ali, and, his, party, it, has, been, reported, in, mainly, persian, historical, sources, written, 300, years, later, such, as, in, the, history, of, al, tabari, that, after, ali, s, refusal, to, pay, homage, abu, bakr, sent, umar, with, an, armed, contingent, to, fatimah, s, house, where, ali, and, his, supporters, are, said, to, have, gathered, umar, is, reported, to, have, warned, those, in, the, house, that, unless, ali, succumbed, to, abu, bakr, he, would, set, the, house, on, fire, and, under, these, circumstances, ali, was, forced, to, capitulate, this, version, of, events, fully, accepted, by, shia, scholars, is, generally, rejected, by, sunni, scholars, who, in, view, of, other, reports, in, their, literature, believe, that, ali, gave, an, oath, of, alliance, to, abu, bakr, without, any, grievance, but, then, other, sunni, and, shia, sources, say, that, ali, did, not, swear, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, after, his, election, but, six, months, later, after, the, death, of, his, wife, fatimah, putting, into, question, al, tabari, s, account, either, way, the, sunni, and, the, shia, accounts, both, accept, that, ali, felt, that, abu, bakr, should, have, informed, him, before, going, into, the, meeting, with, the, ansar, and, that, ali, did, swear, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, western, scholars, tend, to, agree, that, ali, believed, he, had, a, clear, mandate, to, succeed, muhammad, but, offer, differing, views, as, to, the, extent, of, use, of, force, by, umar, in, an, attempt, to, intimidate, ali, and, his, supporters, for, instance, madelung, discounts, the, possibility, of, the, use, of, force, and, argues, that, isolated, reports, of, use, of, force, against, ali, and, banu, hashim, who, unanimously, refused, to, swear, allegiance, for, six, months, are, probably, to, be, discounted, abu, bakr, no, doubt, was, wise, enough, to, restrain, umar, from, any, violence, against, them, well, realizing, that, this, would, inevitably, provoke, the, sense, of, solidarity, of, the, majority, of, abdul, mannaf, whose, acquiescence, he, needed, his, policy, was, rather, not, isolating, banu, hashim, as, far, as, possible, according, to, tom, holland, umar, s, historicity, is, beyond, dispute, an, armenian, bishop, writing, a, decade, or, so, after, qadisiyya, describes, umar, as, a, mighty, potentate, coordinating, the, advance, of, the, sons, of, ismael, from, the, depths, of, the, desert, tom, holland, writes, what, added, incomparably, to, his, prestige, was, that, his, earth, shaking, qualities, as, a, generalissimo, were, combined, with, the, most, distinctive, cast, of, virtues, rather, than, ape, the, manner, of, a, caesar, as, the, ghassanid, kings, had, done, he, drew, on, the, example, of, a, quite, different, kind, of, christian, umar, s, threadbare, robes, his, diet, of, bread, salt, and, water, and, his, rejection, of, worldly, riches, would, have, reminded, anyone, from, the, desert, reaches, beyond, palestine, of, a, very, particular, kind, of, person, monks, out, in, the, judaean, desert, had, long, been, casting, themselves, as, warriors, of, god, the, achievement, of, umar, was, to, take, such, language, to, a, literal, and, previously, unimaginable, extreme, due, to, the, delicate, political, situation, in, arabia, umar, initially, opposed, military, operations, against, the, rebel, tribes, there, hoping, to, gain, their, support, in, the, event, of, an, invasion, by, the, romans, or, the, persians, later, however, he, came, to, agree, with, abu, bakr, s, strategy, to, crush, the, rebellion, by, force, by, late, 632, ce, khalid, ibn, walid, had, successfully, united, arabia, after, consecutive, victories, against, the, rebels, during, his, own, reign, later, umar, would, mostly, adopt, the, policy, of, avoiding, wars, and, consolidating, his, power, in, the, incorporated, lands, rather, than, expanding, his, empire, through, continuous, warfare, umar, advised, abu, bakr, to, compile, the, quran, in, the, form, of, a, book, after, 300, huff, memorizers, of, the, quran, died, in, the, battle, of, yamamah, abu, bakr, appointed, umar, as, his, successor, before, dying, in, 634, ce, due, to, his, strict, and, autocratic, nature, umar, was, not, a, very, popular, figure, among, the, notables, of, medina, and, members, of, majlis, al, shura, accordingly, high, ranking, companions, of, abu, bakr, attempted, to, discourage, him, from, naming, umar, nevertheless, abu, bakr, decided, to, make, umar, his, successor, umar, was, well, known, for, his, extraordinary, willpower, intelligence, political, astuteness, impartiality, justice, and, care, for, the, poor, abu, bakr, is, reported, to, have, said, to, the, high, ranking, advisers, his, umar, s, strictness, was, there, because, of, my, softness, when, the, weight, of, caliphate, will, be, over, his, shoulders, he, will, remain, no, longer, strict, if, i, will, be, asked, by, god, to, whom, i, have, appointed, my, successor, i, will, tell, him, that, i, have, appointed, the, best, man, among, your, men, abu, bakr, was, aware, of, umar, s, power, and, ability, to, succeed, him, his, was, perhaps, one, of, the, smoothest, transitions, of, power, from, one, authority, to, another, in, the, muslim, lands, before, his, death, abu, bakr, called, uthman, to, write, his, will, in, which, he, declared, umar, his, successor, in, his, will, he, instructed, umar, to, continue, the, conquests, on, iraqi, and, syrian, fronts, even, though, almost, all, of, the, muslims, had, given, their, pledge, of, loyalty, to, umar, he, was, feared, more, than, loved, according, to, muhammad, husayn, haykal, the, first, challenge, for, umar, was, to, win, over, his, subjects, and, the, members, of, majlis, al, shura, umar, was, a, gifted, orator, and, he, used, his, ability, to, improve, his, reputation, among, the, people, muhammad, husayn, haykal, wrote, that, umar, s, stress, was, on, the, well, being, of, the, poor, and, underprivileged, in, addition, to, this, umar, in, order, to, improve, his, reputation, and, relation, with, the, banu, hashim, the, tribe, of, ali, delivered, to, the, latter, his, disputed, estates, in, khayber, he, followed, abu, bakr, s, decision, over, the, disputed, land, of, fidak, continuing, to, treat, it, as, state, property, in, the, ridda, wars, thousands, of, prisoners, from, rebel, and, apostate, tribes, were, taken, away, as, slaves, during, the, expeditions, umar, ordered, a, general, amnesty, for, the, prisoners, and, their, immediate, emancipation, this, made, umar, quite, popular, among, the, bedouin, tribes, with, the, necessary, public, support, on, his, side, umar, took, the, bold, decision, of, recalling, khalid, ibn, walid, from, supreme, command, on, the, roman, front, the, government, of, umar, was, a, unitary, government, where, the, sovereign, political, authority, was, the, caliph, the, empire, of, umar, was, divided, into, provinces, and, some, autonomous, territories, e, g, azerbaijan, and, armenia, that, had, accepted, the, suzerainty, of, the, caliphate, the, provinces, were, administered, by, the, provincial, governors, or, wali, personally, and, fastidiously, selected, by, umar, provinces, were, further, divided, into, about, 100, districts, each, district, or, main, city, was, under, the, charge, of, a, junior, governor, or, amir, usually, appointed, by, umar, himself, but, occasionally, also, appointed, by, the, provincial, governor, other, officers, at, the, provincial, level, were, in, some, districts, there, were, separate, military, officers, though, the, wali, was, in, most, cases, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, quartered, in, the, province, every, appointment, was, made, in, writing, at, the, time, of, appointment, an, instrument, of, instructions, was, issued, with, a, view, to, regulating, the, wali, s, conduct, on, assuming, office, the, wali, was, required, to, assemble, the, people,

umar, was, on, his, way, to, visit, syria, at, elat, he, was, received, by, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, governor, of, syria, who, informed, him, about, the, plague, and, its, intensity, and, suggested, that, umar, go, back, to, medina, umar, tried, to, persuade, abu, ubaidah, to, come, with, him, to, medina, but, he, declined, to, leave, his, troops, in, that, critical, situation, abu, ubaidah, died, in, 639, of, the, plague, which, also, cost, the, lives, of, 25, 000, muslims, in, syria, after, the, plague, had, weakened, in, late, 639, umar, visited, syria, for, political, and,

persecuted, as, religious, minorities, and, taxed, heavily, to, finance, the, byzantine, sassanid, wars, often, aided, muslims, to, take, over, their, lands, from, the, byzantines, and, persians, resulting, in, exceptionally, speedy, conquests, as, new, areas, were, attached, to, the, caliphate, they, also, benefited, from, free, trade, while, trading, with, other, areas, in, the, caliphate, to, encourage, commerce, in, islam, trade, is, not, taxed, but, wealth, is, subject, to, the, zakat, since, the, constitution, of, medina, drafted, by, muhammad, the, jews, and, the, christians, continued, to, use, their, own, laws, in, the, caliphate, and, had, their, own, judges, in, 644, umar, was, assassinated, by, a, persian, slave, named, abu, lu, lu, a, firuz, his, motivation, for, the, assassination, is, not, clear, but, medieval, sources, attribute, it, to, a, tax, dispute, with, his, arab, master, al, mughira, ibn, shu, ba, according, to, some, historical, accounts, abu, lu, lu, a, was, a, zoroastrian, from, nahavand, iran, though, other, reports, describe, him, as, a, christian, a, highly, skilled, joiner, and, blacksmith, abu, lu, lu, a, was, probably, taken, captive, by, his, master, al, mughira, in, the, battle, of, nahavand, 642, and, subsequently, brought, to, arabia, where, he, may, also, have, converted, to, islam, other, historical, sources, report, that, he, was, rather, taken, captive, by, al, mughira, in, the, battle, of, al, qadisiyya, 636, or, that, he, was, sold, to, al, mughira, by, hurmuz, n, an, ex, sassanid, military, officer, who, had, been, working, for, umar, as, an, adviser, after, his, own, capture, by, the, muslims, although, medina, was, generally, off, limits, to, the, ajam, non, arabs, under, umar, s, reign, abu, lu, lu, a, was, exceptionally, allowed, to, enter, the, capital, of, the, early, caliphate, being, sent, there, by, al, mughira, to, serve, the, caliph, when, al, mughira, forced, abu, lu, lu, a, to, pay, a, khar, j, tax, of, two, dirhams, a, day, abu, lu, lu, a, turned, to, umar, to, protest, this, tax, however, umar, refused, to, lift, the, tax, thus, provoking, abu, lu, lu, a, s, rage, although, this, is, the, reason, given, by, most, historical, accounts, for, abu, lu, lu, a, s, assassination, of, umar, umar, s, biased, policies, against, non, arab, captives, may, also, have, played, a, prominent, role, one, day, when, umar, was, leading, the, congregational, prayer, in, the, mosque, of, medina, abu, lu, lu, a, stabbed, him, with, a, double, bladed, dagger, there, are, different, versions, of, how, this, happened, according, to, one, version, he, also, killed, kulayb, ibn, al, bukayr, al, laythi, who, was, behind, umar, while, in, another, version, he, stabbed, thirteen, people, who, tried, to, restrain, him, according, to, some, accounts, the, caliph, died, on, the, day, of, the, stabbing, wednesday, 26, dhu, al, hijja, of, the, islamic, year, 23, or, 3, november, 644, according, to, the, julian, calendar, or, 6, november, 644, according, to, the, gregorian, calendar, while, other, accounts, maintain, that, he, survived, three, more, days, some, historical, sources, report, that, abu, lu, lu, a, was, taken, prisoner, and, executed, for, his, assassination, of, umar, while, other, sources, claim, that, he, committed, suicide, after, abu, lu, lu, a, s, death, his, daughter, was, killed, by, ubayd, allah, ibn, umar, one, of, umar, s, sons, acting, upon, the, claim, of, one, man, either, abd, al, rahman, ibn, awf, or, abd, al, rahman, ibn, abi, bakr, that, they, had, been, seen, conspiring, with, abu, lu, lu, a, while, he, was, holding, the, double, bladed, dagger, ubayd, allah, also, killed, hurmuz, n, umar, s, persian, military, adviser, and, jufayna, a, christian, man, from, al, hira, iraq, who, had, been, taken, to, medina, to, serve, as, a, private, tutor, to, a, family, in, medina, after, ubayd, allah, was, detained, for, these, murders, he, threatened, to, kill, all, foreign, captives, residing, in, medina, as, well, as, some, others, although, ubayd, allah, may, have, been, encouraged, by, his, sister, hafsa, bint, umar, to, avenge, their, father, s, death, his, murder, of, hurmuz, n, and, jufayna, was, likely, the, result, of, a, mental, breakdown, rather, than, of, a, true, conspiracy, it, was, regarded, by, his, peers, as, a, crime, rather, than, as, a, legitimate, act, of, retaliation, in, early, 20th, century, scholarship, it, was, sometimes, supposed, that, abu, lu, lu, a, had, really, been, an, instrument, in, the, hands, of, a, conspiracy, though, not, a, conspiracy, led, by, hurmuz, n, but, rather, one, led, by, ali, al, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, and, talha, ibn, ubayd, allah, these, men, who, according, to, the, historical, sources, were, appointed, by, umar, himself, as, members, of, the, council, who, would, elect, the, next, caliph, were, thought, by, scholars, to, have, conspired, to, overthrow, umar, s, reign, and, to, put, ali, in, his, place, this, hypothesis, however, is, rejected, by, more, recent, scholars, nevertheless, while, ubayd, allah, was, subsequently, acquitted, of, his, crimes, by, umar, s, successor, uthman, r, 644, 656, who, considered, the, execution, of, ubayd, allah, an, excessive, measure, in, view, of, his, father, s, recent, assassination, ali, among, others, did, protest, against, this, and, vowed, to, apply, the, regular, punishment, for, murder, if, he, were, ever, to, be, caliph, umar, was, buried, at, the, green, dome, in, al, masjid, al, nabawi, alongside, muhammad, and, the, caliph, abu, bakr, by, the, permission, of, aisha, given, to, his, son, abdullah, ibn, umar, on, umar, s, request, on, his, deathbed, umar, vacillated, on, his, succession, however, it, has, been, reported, that, he, said, that, if, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, khalid, ibn, walid, or, salim, the, mawla, and, freed, persian, slave, were, alive, he, would, have, appointed, one, of, them, his, successor, umar, finally, appointed, a, committee, of, six, persons, to, choose, a, caliph, from, amongst, them, abdur, rahman, bin, awf, saad, ibn, abi, waqqas, talha, ibn, ubaidullah, uthman, ibn, affan, ali, ibn, abi, talib, and, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, all, six, are, among, the, ten, to, whom, paradise, was, promised, according, to, sunnis, the, only, one, out, of, the, famous, ten, left, out, of, the, committee, who, was, still, alive, at, the, time, was, saeed, ibn, zaid, the, cousin, and, brother, in, law, of, umar, he, was, excluded, on, the, basis, of, being, related, by, blood, and, of, the, same, tribe, as, umar, umar, had, a, policy, of, not, appointing, anyone, related, to, him, to, a, position, of, authority, even, if, they, were, qualified, by, his, standards, umar, appointed, a, band, of, fifty, armed, soldiers, to, protect, the, house, where, the, meeting, was, proceeding, until, the, appointment, of, the, next, caliph, umar, appointed, a, notable, sahabi, and, mawla, suhayb, ar, rumi, suhayb, the, roman, as, a, deputy, or, caretaker, caliph, to, run, state, affairs, while, the, meeting, for, selection, of, a, caliph, was, proceeding, abdulrehman, ibn, abu, bakr, and, abdur, rahman, bin, awf, revealed, that, they, saw, the, dagger, used, by, abu, lu, lu, a, the, assassin, of, umar, a, night, before, umar, s, assassination, reported, abdur, rahman, bin, awf, he, saw, hurmuzan, jafina, and, abu, lu, lu, a, while, they, were, suspiciously, discussing, something, surprised, by, his, presence, the, dagger, fell, it, was, the, same, two, sided, dagger, used, in, the, assassination, abdulrehman, ibn, abu, bakr, son, of, the, late, caliph, abu, bakr, confirmed, that, a, few, days, before, umar, s, assassination, he, saw, this, dagger, in, hurmuzan, s, possession, after, this, revelation, it, seemed, clear, that, it, had, been, planned, by, the, persians, residing, in, medina, infuriated, by, this, umar, s, younger, son, ubaidullah, ibn, umar, sought, to, kill, all, the, persians, in, medina, he, killed, hurmuzan, jafinah, and, the, daughter, of, umar, s, assassin, abu, lu, lu, a, who, is, believed, to, have, been, a, muslim, ubaidullah, was, intercepted, by, the, people, of, medina, who, prevented, him, from, continuing, the, massacre, amr, ibn, al, aas, is, said, to, have, intercepted, him, and, convinced, him, to, hand, over, his, sword, the, murder, of, jafinah, enraged, saad, ibn, abi, waqqas, his, foster, brother, and, he, assaulted, ubaidullah, ibn, umar, again,

644, on, 7, november, uthman, succeeded, him, as, caliph, after, prolonged, negotiations, the, tribunal, decided, to, give, blood, money, to, the, victims, and, released, umar, s, son, ubaidullah, on, the, ground, that, after, the, tragedy, of, umar, s, assassination, people, would, be, further, infuriated, by, the, execution, of, his, son, the, very, next, day, umar, was, strong, fit, athletic, and, good, at, wrestling, he, is, said, to, have, participated, in, the, wrestling, matches, on, the, occasion, of, the, annual, fair, of, ukaz, from, first, hand, accounts, of, his, physical,

working, with, two, hands, both, his, eyes, were, black, with, yellow, skin, however, ibn, sa, ad, in, his, book, stated, that, he, never, knew, that, umar, had, yellow, skin, except, for, a, certain, part, of, umar, s, life, where, his, color, changed, due, to, his, frequent, consumption, of, oil, moreover, it, is, also, narrated, that, he, was, initially, white, but, his, color, turned, dark, during, the, year, of, ashes, 18, a, h, where, a, famine, caused, him, to, exert, considerable, effort, in, running, the, caliphate, whilst, there, was, a, widespread, lack, of, food, it, is, also,

of, islam, where, muslims, were, united, as, a, single, community, abdullah, ibn, mas, ud, would, often, weep, whenever, the, subject, of, umar, was, brought, up, he, said, umar, was, a, fortress, of,

of, small, bands, one, after, the, other, giving, the, impression, of, a, continuous, stream, of, reinforcements, that, finally, lured, the, byzantines, to, an, untimely, battle, on, the, other, hand, yazdegerd, iii, was, engaged, in, negotiations, that, further, gave, umar, time, to, transfer, his, troops, from, syria, to, iraq, these, troops, proved, decisive, in, the, battle, of, qadisiyyah, his, strategy, resulted, in, a, muslim, victory, at, the, second, battle, of, emesa, in, 638, where, the, pro, byzantine, christian, arabs, of, jazira, aided, by, the, byzantine, emperor, made, an,
