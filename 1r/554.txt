an, early, influence, on, makeba, s, music, as, were, female, jazz, singers, from, the, us, historian, david, coplan, writes, that, the, african, jazz, made, popular, by, makeba, and, others, was,

performances, historian, ruth, feldstein, described, her, music, as, the, borders, between, what, many, people, associated, with, avant, garde, and, quality, culture, and, the, commercial, mainstream, the, latter, aspect, often, drew, criticism, she, was, able, to, appeal, to, audiences, from, many, political, racial, and, national, backgrounds, she, was, known, for, having, a, dynamic, vocal, range, and, was, described, as, having, an, emotional, awareness, during, her, performances, she, occasionally, danced, during, her, shows, and, was, described, as, having, a, sensuous, presence, on,

could, sing, while, making, the, epiglottal, clicks, of, the, xhosa, language, she, sang, in, english, and, several, african, languages, but, never, in, afrikaans, the, language, of, the, apartheid, government, in, south, africa, she, once, stated, when, afrikaaners, sing, in, my, language, then, i, will, sing, theirs, english, was, seen, as, the, language, of, political, resistance, by, black, south, africans, due, to, the, educational, barriers, they, faced, under, apartheid, the, manhattan, brothers, with, whom, makeba, had, sung, in, sophiatown, had, been, prohibited, from, recording,

life, in, south, africa, which, included, describing, the, pain, she, felt, living, under, apartheid, she, once, stated, people, say, i, sing, politics, but, what, i, sing, is, not, politics, it, is, the, truth, an, example, of, the, mixing, of, personal, and, political, issues, for, musicians, living, during, apartheid, when, she, first, entered, the, us, she, avoided, discussing, apartheid, explicitly, partly, out, of, concern, for, her, family, still, in, south, africa, nonetheless, she, is, known, for, using, her, voice, to, convey, the, political, message, of, opposition, to, apartheid, performing, widely, and, frequently, for, civil, rights, and, anti, apartheid, organisations, even, songs, that, did, not, carry, an, explicitly, political, message, were, seen, as, subversive, due, to, their, being, banned, in, south, africa, makeba, saw, her, music, as, a, tool, of, activism, saying, in, our, struggle, songs, are, not, simply, entertainment, for, us, they, are, the, way, we, communicate, she, expressed, her, political, views, and, criticism, of, apartheid, in, particular, more, frequently, in, later, years, her, exile, and, the, death, of, her, daughter, have, both, been, identified, as, making, her, more, vocal, makeba, s, use, of, the, clicks, common, in, languages, such, as, xhosa, and, zulu, as, in, qongqothwane, the, click, song, was, frequently, remarked, upon, by, western, audiences, it, contributed, to, her, popularity, and, her, exotic, image, which, scholars, have, described, as, a, kind, of, othering, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, western, audiences, often, could, not, understand, her, lyrics, critics, in, the, us, described, her, as, the, african, tribeswoman, and, as, an, import, from, south, africa, often, depicting, her, in, condescending, terms, as, a, product, of, a, more, primitive, society, in, seeing, her, as, an, embodiment, of, africa, western, audiences, tended, to, ignore, her, cosmopolitan, background, conversely, she, is, also, described, as, shaping, pan, african, identity, during, the, decline, of, colonialism, commentators, also, frequently, described, her, in, terms, of, the, prominent, men, she, was, associated, with, despite, her, own, prominence, during, her, early, career, in, south, africa, she, had, been, seen, as, a, sex, symbol, an, image, that, received, considerably, less, attention, in, the, us, makeba, was, described, as, a, style, icon, both, in, her, home, country, and, the, us, she, wore, no, makeup, and, refused, to, straighten, her, hair, for, shows, thus, helping, establish, a, style, that, came, to, be, known, internationally, as, the, afro, look, according, to, music, scholar, tanisha, ford, her, hairstyle, represented, a, liberated, african, beauty, aesthetic, she, was, seen, as, a, beauty, icon, by, south, african, schoolgirls, who, were, compelled, to, shorten, their, hair, by, the, apartheid, government, makeba, stuck, to, wearing, african, jewellery, she, disapproved, of, the, skin, lighteners, commonly, used, by, south, african, women, at, the, time, and, refused, to, appear, in, advertisements, for, them, her, self, presentation, has, been, characterised, by, scholars, as, a, rejection, of, the, predominantly, white, standards, of, beauty, that, women, in, the, us, were, held, to, which, allowed, makeba, to, partially, escape, the, sexualisation, directed, at, women, performers, during, this, period, nonetheless, the, terms, used, to, describe, her, in, the, us, media, have, been, identified, by, scholars, as, frequently, used, to, sexualize, infantalize, and, animalize, people, of, african, heritage, makeba, was, among, the, most, visible, africans, in, the, us, as, a, result, she, was, often, emblematic, of, the, continent, of, africa, for, americans, her, music, earned, her, the, moniker, mama, africa, and, she, was, variously, described, as, the, empress, of, african, song, the, queen, of, south, african, music, and, africa, s, first, superstar, music, scholar, j, u, jacobs, said, that, makeba, s, music, had, both, been, shaped, by, and, given, shape, to, black, south, african, and, american, music,

music, to, a, western, audience, she, is, credited, along, with, artists, such, as, youssou, n, dour, salif, keita, ali, farka, tour, baaba, maal, and, ang, lique, kidjo, with, popularising, the, genre, of, world, music, she, disliked, this, label, however, believing, it, marginalized, music, from, the, third, world, her, work, with, belafonte, in, the, 1960s, has, been, described, as, creating, the, genre, of, world, music, before, the, concept, entered, the, popular, imagination, and, also, as, highlighting, the, diversity, and, cultural, pluralism, within, african, music, within, south, africa, makeba, has, been, described, as, influencing, artists, such, as, kwaito, musician, thandiswa, mazwai, and, her, band, bongo, maffin, whose, track, de, makeba, was, a, modified,

celebrity, by, testifying, against, apartheid, before, the, un, in, 1962, and, 1964, many, of, her, songs, were, banned, within, south, africa, leading, to, makeba, s, records, being, distributed, underground, and, even, her, apolitical, songs, being, seen, as, subversive, she, thus, became, a, symbol, of, resistance, to, the, white, minority, government, both, within, and, outside, south, africa, in, an, interview, in, 2000, masekela, said, that, there, nobody, in, africa, who, made, the, world, more, aware, of, what, was, happening, in, south, africa, than, miriam, makeba, makeba,
