endorsed, at, this, point, godard, s, activities, did, not, include, making, films, rather, he, watched, films, and, wrote, about, them, and, helped, others, make, films, notably, rohmer, with, whom, he, worked, on, pr, sentation, ou, charlotte, et, son, steak, having, left, paris, in, the, fall, of, 1952, godard, returned, to, switzerland, and, went, to, live, with, his, mother, in, lausanne, he,

the, dam, he, moved, to, the, post, of, telephone, switchboard, operator, while, on, duty, in, april, 1954, he, put, through, a, call, to, laubscher, which, relayed, the, fact, that, odile, monod,

a, feature, film, of, goethe, s, elective, affinities, proved, too, ambitious, and, came, to, nothing, truffaut, enlisted, his, help, to, work, on, an, idea, he, had, for, a, film, based, on, the, true, crime, story, of, a, petty, criminal, michel, portail, who, had, shot, a, motorcycle, policeman, and, whose, girlfriend, had, turned, him, in, to, the, police, but, truffaut, failed, to, interest, any, producers, another, project, with, truffaut, a, comedy, about, a, country, girl, arriving, in, paris, was, also, abandoned, he, worked, with, rohmer, on, a, planned, series, of, short, films, centering, on, the, lives, of, two, young, women, charlotte, and, v, ronique, and, in, the, autumn, of, 1957, pierre, braunberger, produced, the, first, film, in, the, series, all, the, boys, are, called, patrick, directed, by, godard, from, rohmer, s, script, a, story, of, water, 1958, was, created, largely, out, of, unused, footage, shot, by, truffaut, in, 1958, godard, with, a, cast, that, included, jean, paul, belmondo, and, anne, colette, made, his, last, short, before, gaining, international, prominence, as, a, filmmaker, charlotte, et, son, jules, a, homage, to, jean, cocteau, the, film, was, shot, in, godard, s, hotel, room, on, the, rue, de, rennes, and, apparently, reflected, something, of, the, romantic, austerity, of, godard, s, own, life, at, this, time, his, swiss, friend, roland, tolmatchoff, noted, in, paris, he, had, a, big, bogart, poster, on, the, wall, and, nothing, else, in, december, 1958, godard, reported, from, the, festival, of, short, films, in, tours, and, praised, the, work, of, and, became, friends, with, jacques, demy, jacques, rozier, and, agn, s, varda, he, already, knew, alain, resnais, whose, entry, he, praised, but, godard, now, wanted, to, make, a, feature, film, he, travelled, to, the, 1959, cannes, film, festival, and, asked, truffaut, to, let, him, use, the, story, on, which, they, had, collaborated, in, 1956, about, car, thief, michel, portail, he, sought, money, from, producer, georges, de, beauregard, whom, he, had, met, previously, while, working, briefly, in, the, publicity, department, of, twentieth, century, fox, s, paris, office, and, who, was, also, at, the, festival, beauregard, could, offer, his, expertise, but, was, in, debt, from, two, productions, based, on, pierre, loti, stories, hence, financing, came, instead, from, a, film, distributor, ren, pigni, res, godard, s, most, celebrated, period, as, a, director, spans, roughly, from, his, first, feature, breathless, 1960, through, to, week, end, 1967, his, work, during, this, period, focused, on, relatively, conventional, films, that, often, refer, to, different, aspects, of, film, history, although, godard, s, work, during, this, time, is, considered, groundbreaking, in, its, own, right, the, period, stands, in, contrast, to, that, which, immediately, followed, it, during, which, godard, ideologically, denounced, much, of, cinema, s, history, as, bourgeois, and, therefore, without, merit, godard, s, breathless, bout, de, souffle, 1960, starring, jean, paul, belmondo, and, jean, seberg, distinctly, expressed, the, french, new, wave, s, style, and, incorporated, quotations, from, several, elements, of, popular, culture, specifically, american, film, noir, the, film, employed, various, techniques, such, as, the, innovative, use, of, jump, cuts, which, were, traditionally, considered, amateurish, character, asides, and, breaking, the, eyeline, match, in, continuity, editing, another, unique, aspect, of, breathless, was, the, spontaneous, writing, of, the, script, on, the, day, of, shooting, a, technique, that, the, actors, found, unsettling, which, contribute, to, the, spontaneous, documentary, like, ambiance, of, the, film, from, the, beginning, of, his, career, godard, included, more, film, references, in, his, movies, than, any, of, his, new, wave, colleagues, in, breathless, his, citations, include, a, movie, poster, showing, humphrey, bogart, from, the, harder, they, fall, his, last, film, whose, expression, the, lead, actor, jean, paul, belmondo, tries, reverently, to, imitate, visual, quotations, from, films, of, ingmar, bergman, samuel, fuller, fritz, lang, and, others, and, an, onscreen, dedication, to, monogram, pictures, an, american, b, movie, studio, quotations, from, and, references, to, literature, include, william, faulkner, dylan, thomas, louis, aragon, rilke, fran, oise, sagan, and, maurice, sachs, the, film, also, contains, citations, in, images, or, on, the, soundtrack, mozart, picasso, j, s, bach, paul, klee, and, auguste, renoir, this, first, person, cinema, invoked, not, the, director, s, experience, but, his, presence, godard, wanted, to, hire, the, american, actress, jean, seberg, who, was, living, in, paris, with, her, husband, fran, ois, moreuil, a, lawyer, to, play, the, american, woman, seberg, had, become, famous, in, 1956, when, otto, preminger, had, chosen, her, to, play, joan, of, arc, in, his, saint, joan, and, had, then, cast, her, in, his, 1958, adaptation, of, bonjour, tristesse, her, performance, in, this, film, had, not, been, generally, regarded, as, a, success, the, new, york, times, s, critic, called, her, a, misplaced, amateur, but, truffaut, and, godard, disagreed, in, the, role, of, michel, poiccard, godard, cast, belmondo, an, actor, he, had, already, called, writing, in, arts, in, 1958, the, michel, simon, and, the, jules, berry, of, tomorrow, the, cameraman, was, raoul, coutard, choice, of, the, producer, beauregard, godard, wanted, breathless, to, be, shot, like, a, documentary, with, a, lightweight, handheld, camera, and, a, minimum, of, added, lighting, coutard, had, experience, as, a, documentary, cameraman, while, working, for, the, french, army, s, information, service, in, indochina, during, the, french, indochina, war, tracking, shots, were, filmed, by, coutard, from, a, wheelchair, pushed, by, godard, though, godard, had, prepared, a, traditional, screenplay, he, dispensed, with, it, and, wrote, the, dialogue, day, by, day, as, the, production, went, ahead, the, film, s, importance, was, recognised, immediately, and, in, january, 1960, godard, won, the, jean, vigo, prize, awarded, to, encourage, an, auteur, of, the, future, one, reviewer, mentioned, alexandre, astruc, s,

appeared, again, along, with, belmondo, in, godard, s, first, color, film, a, woman, is, a, woman, 1961, their, first, project, to, be, released, the, film, was, intended, as, a, homage, to, the, american, musical, adjustments, that, godard, made, to, the, original, version, of, the, story, gave, it, autobiographical, resonances, specifically, in, regard, to, his, relationship, with, anna, karina, the, film, revealed, the, confinement, within, the, four, walls, of, domestic, life, and, the, emotional, and, artistic, fault, lines, that, threatened, their, relationship, godard, s, next, film, vivre, sa, vie, my, life, to, live, 1962, was, one, of, his, most, popular, among, critics, karina, starred, as, nana, an, errant, mother, and, aspiring, actress, whose, financially, strained, circumstances, lead, her, to, the, life, of, a, streetwalker, it, is, an, episodic, account, of, her, rationalisations, to, prove, she, is, free, even, though, she, is, tethered, at, the, end, of,

actors, are, preparing, and, after, the, end, of, the, take, while, the, actors, are, coming, out, of, character, week, end, s, enigmatic, and, audacious, end, title, sequence, which, reads, end, of, cinema, appropriately, marked, an, end, to, the, narrative, and, cinematic, period, in, godard, s, filmmaking, career, godard, was, known, for, his, highly, political, voice, and, regularly, featured, political, content, in, his, films, one, of, his, earliest, features, le, petit, soldat, which, dealt, with, the, algerian, war, of, independence, was, notable, for, its, attempt, to, present, the, complexity, of, the, dispute, the, film, was, perceived, as, equivocating, and, as, drawing, a, moral, equivalence, between, the, french, forces, and, the, national, liberation, front, along, these, lines, les, carabiniers, presents, a, fictional, war, that, is, initially, romanticized, in, the, way, its, characters, approach, their, service, but, becomes, a, stiff, anti, war, metonym, in, addition, to, the, international, conflicts, to, which, godard, sought, an, artistic, response, he, was, also, very, concerned, with, the, social, problems, in, france, the, earliest, and, best, example, of, this, is, karina, s, potent, portrayal, of, a, prostitute, in, vivre, sa, vie, in, 1960s, paris, the, political, milieu, was, not, overwhelmed, by, one, specific, movement, there, was, however, a, distinct, post, war, climate, shaped, by, various, international, conflicts, such, as, colonialism, in, north, africa, and, southeast, asia, godard, s, marxist, disposition, did, not, become, abundantly, explicit, until, la, chinoise, and, week, end, but, is, evident, in, several, films, namely, pierrot, and, une, femme, mari, e, godard, was, accused, by, some, of, harbouring, anti, semitic, views, in, 2010, in, the, lead, up, to, the, presentation, of, godard, s, honorary, oscar, a, prominent, article, in, the, new, york, times, by, michael, cieply, drew, attention, to, the, idea, which, had, been, circulating, through, the, press, in, previous, weeks, that, godard, might, be, an, anti, semite, and, thus, undeserving, of, the, accolade, cieply, makes, reference, to, richard, brody, s, book, everything, is, cinema, the, working, life, of, jean, luc, godard, and, alluded, to, a, previous, longer, article, published, by, the, jewish, journal, as, lying, near, the, origin, of, the, debate, the, article, also, draws, upon, brody, s, book, for, example, in, the, following, quotation, which, godard, made, on, television, in, 1981, moses, is, my, principal, enemy, moses, when, he, received, the, commandments, he, saw, images, and, translated, them, then, he, brought, the, texts, he, didn, t, show, what, he, had, seen, that, s, why, the, jewish, people, are, accursed, immediately, after, cieply, s, article, was, published, brody, made, a, clear, point, of, criticising, the, extremely, selective, and, narrow, use, of, passages, in, his, book, and, noted, that, godard, s, work, approached, the, holocaust, with, the, greatest, moral, seriousness, indeed, his, documentaries, feature, images, from, the, holocaust, in, a, context, suggesting, he, considers, nazism, and, the, holocaust, as, the, nadir, of, human, history, godard, s, views, become, more, complex, regarding, the, state, of, israel, in, 1970, godard, travelled, to, the, middle, east, to, make, a, pro, palestinian, film, he, did, not, complete, and, whose, footage, eventually, became, part, of, the, 1976, film, ici, et, ailleurs, in, this, film, godard, seems, to, view, the, palestinians, cause, as, one, of, many, worldwide, leftist, revolutionary, movements, elsewhere, godard, explicitly, identified, himself, as, an, anti, zionist, but, denied, the, accusations, of, anti, semitism, godard, produced, several, pieces, that, directly, address, the, vietnam, war, furthermore, there, are, two, scenes, in, pierrot, le, fou, that, tackle, the, issue, the, first, is, a, scene, that, takes, place, in, the, initial, car, ride, between, ferdinand, belmondo, and, marianne, karina, over, the, car, radio, the, two, hear, the, message, garrison, massacred, by, the, viet, cong, who, lost, 115, men, marianne, responds, with, an, extended, musing, on, the, way, the, radio, dehumanises, the, northern, vietnamese, combatants, the, war, is, present, throughout, the, film, in, mentions, allusions, and, depictions, in, newsreel, footage, and, the, film, s, style, was, affected, by, godard, s, political, anger, at, the, war, upsetting, his, ability, to, draw, from, earlier, cinematic, styles, notably, he, also, participated, in, loin, du, vietnam, 1967, an, anti, war, project, it, consists, of, seven, sketches, directed, by, godard, who, used, stock, footage, from, la, chinoise, claude, lelouch, joris, ivens, william, klein, chris, marker, alain, resnais, and, agn, s, varda, godard, s, engagement, with, german, poet, and, playwright, bertolt, brecht, stems, primarily, from, his, attempt, to, transpose, brecht, s, theory, of, epic, theatre, and, its, prospect, of, alienating, the, viewer, verfremdungseffekt, through, a, radical, separation, of, the, elements, of, the, medium, theatre, in, brecht, s, case, but, in, godard, s, film, brecht, s, influence, is, keenly, felt, through, much, of, godard, s, work, particularly, before, 1980, when, godard, used, cinematic, expression, for, specific, political, ends, for, example, breathless, s, elliptical, editing, which, denies, the, viewer, a, fluid, narrative, typical, of, mainstream, cinema, forces, the, viewers, to, take, on, more, critical, roles, connecting, the, pieces, themselves, and, coming, away, with, more, investment, in, the, work, s, content, in, many, of, his, most, political, pieces, specifically, week, end, pierrot, le, fou, and, la, chinoise, characters, address, the, audience, with, thoughts, feelings, and, instructions, a, marxist, reading, is, possible, with, most, if, not, all, of, godard, s, early, work, godard, s, direct, interaction, with, marxism, does, not, become, explicitly, apparent, however, until, week, end, where, the, name, karl, marx, is, cited, in, conjunction, with, figures, such, as, jesus, christ, a, constant, refrain, throughout, godard, s, cinematic, period, is, that, of, the, bourgeoisie, s, consumerism, the, commodification, of, daily, life, and, activity, and, man, s, alienation, all, central, features, of, marx, s, critique, of, capitalism, in, an, essay, on, godard, philosopher, and, aesthetics, scholar, jacques, ranci, re, states, when, in, pierrot, le, fou, 1965, a, film, without, a, clear, political, message, belmondo, played, on, the, word, scandal, and, the, freedom, that, the, scandal, girdle, supposedly, offered, women, the, context, of, a, marxist, critique, of, commodification, of, pop, art, derision, at, consumerism, and, of, a, feminist, denunciation, of, women, s, false, liberation, was, enough, to, foster, a, dialectical, reading, of, the, joke, and, the, whole, story, the, way, godard, treated, politics, in, his, cinematic, period, was, in, the, context, of, a, joke, a, piece, of, art, or, a, relationship, presented, to, be, used, as, tools, of, reference, romanticising, the, marxist, rhetoric, rather, than, being, solely, tools, of, education, une, femme, mari, e, is, also, structured, around, marx, s, concept, of, commodity, fetishism, godard, once, said, that, it, is, a, film, in, which, individuals, are, considered, as, things, in, which, chases, in, a, taxi, alternate, with, ethological, interviews, in, which, the, spectacle, of, life, is, intermingled, with, its, analysis, he, was, very, conscious, of, the, way, he, wished, to, portray, the, human, being, his, efforts, are, overtly, characteristic, of, marx, who, in, his, economic, and, philosophical, manuscripts, of, 1844, gives, one, of, his, most, nuanced, elaborations, analysing, how, the, worker, is, alienated, from, his, product, the, object, of, his, productive, activity, georges, sadoul, in, his, short, rumination, on, the, film, describes, it, as, a, sociological, study, of, the, alienation, of, the, modern, woman, the, period, which, spans, from, may, 1968, into, the, 1970s, has, been, given, various, labels, from, his, militant, period, to, his, radical, period, along, with, terms, as, specific, as, maoist, and, as, vague, as, political, in, any, case, the, period, saw, godard, employ, consistent, revolutionary, rhetoric, in, his, films, and, in, his, public, statements, inspired, by, the, may, 68, upheaval, godard, alongside, fran, ois, truffaut, led, protests, that, shut, down, the, 1968, cannes, film, festival, in, solidarity, with, the, students, and, workers, godard, stated, there, was, not, a, single, film, showing, at, the, festival, that, represented, their, causes, not, one, whether, by, milos, myself, roman, or, fran, ois, there, are, none, we, re, behind, the, times, amid, the, upheavals, of, the, late, 1960s, godard, became, passionate, about, making, political, films, politically, though, many, of, his, films, from, 1968, to, 1972, are, feature, length, films, they, are, low, budget, and, challenge, the, notion, of, what, a, film, can, be, in, addition, to, abandoning, mainstream, filmmaking, godard, also, tried, to, escape, the, cult, of, personality, that, had, formed, around, him, he, worked, anonymously, in, collaboration, with, other, filmmakers, most, notably, jean, pierre, gorin, with, whom, he, formed, the, dziga, vertov, cinema, collective, during, this, period, godard, made, films, in, england, italy, czechoslovakia, palestine, and, the, u, s, as, well, as, france, he, and, gorin, toured, with, their, work, attempting, to, create, discussion, mainly, on, college, campuses, this, period, came, to, a, climax, with, the, big, budget, production, tout, va, bien, which, starred, yves, montand, and, jane, fonda, owing, to, a, motorcycle, accident, that, severely, incapacitated, godard, gorin, ended, up, directing, this, most, celebrated, of, their, work, together, almost, single, handedly, as, a, companion, piece, to, tout, va, bien, the, pair, made, letter, to, jane, a, 50, minute, examination, of, a, still, showing, jane, fonda, visiting, with, the, viet, cong, during, the, vietnam, war, the, film, is, a, deconstruction, of, western, imperialist, ideology, this, was, the, last, film, that, godard, and, gorin, made, together, in, 1978, godard, was, commissioned, by, the, mozambican, government, to, make, a, short, film, during, this, time, his, experience, with, kodak, film, led, him, to, criticise, the, film, stock, as, inherently, racist, since, it, did, not, reflect, the, variety, nuance, or, complexity, in, dark, brown, or, dark, skin, this, was, because, kodak, shirley, cards, were, only, made, for, caucasian, subjects, a, problem, that, was, not, rectified, until, 1995, in, 1972, godard, and, his, life, partner, swiss, filmmaker, anne, marie, mi, ville, started, the, alternative, video, production, and, distribution, company, sonimage, based, in, grenoble,

innovative, video, works, for, european, broadcast, television, titled, six, fois, deux, sur, et, sous, la, communication, 1976, and, france, tour, d, tour, deux, enfants, 1978, from, the, time, that, godard, returned, to, mainstream, filmmaking, in, 1980, anne, marie, mi, ville, remained, an, important, collaborator, after, the, events, of, may, 1968, when, the, city, of, paris, saw, a, total, upheaval, in, response, to, the, authoritarian, de, gaulle, and, godard, s, professional, objective, was, reconsidered, he, began, to, collaborate, with, like, minded, individuals, in, the, filmmaking, arena, his, most, notable, collaborator, was, jean, pierre, gorin, a, maoist, student, of, louis, althusser, michel, foucault, and, jacques, lacan, who, later, became, a, professor, of, film, studies, at, the, university, of, california, at, san, diego, with, a, passion, for, cinema, that, attracted, godard, s, attention, between, 1968, and, 1973, godard, and, gorin, collaborated,

eisenstein, and, russian, constructivist, and, avant, garde, artists, such, as, alexander, rodchenko, and, vladimir, tatlin, part, of, godard, s, political, shift, after, may, 1968, was, toward, a, proactive, participation, in, the, class, struggle, and, he, drew, inspiration, from, filmmakers, associated, with, the, russian, revolution, towards, the, end, of, this, period, of, his, life, godard, began, to, feel, disappointed, with, his, maoist, ideals, and, was, abandoned, by, his, wife, at, the, time, anne, wiazemsky, in, this, context, according, to, biographer, antoine, de,

godard, s, greatness, rests, in, his, grasping, of, the, idea, that, films, are, made, of, moving, images, of, moments, from, films, of, images, projected, in, front, of, audiences, but, that, he,
