parliament, of, iran, elected, mosaddegh, by, a, vote, of, 79, 12, the, shah, was, aware, of, mosaddegh, s, rising, popularity, and, political, power, after, a, period, of, assassinations, by, fada, iyan, e, islam, and, political, unrest, by, the, national, front, demonstrations, erupted, in, tehran, after, mosaddegh, was, elected, with, crowds, further, invigorated, by, the, speeches, of, members, from, the, national, front, there, was, a, special, focus, on, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, and, the, heavy, involvement, of, foreign, actors, and, influences, in, iranian, affairs, although, iran, was, not, officially, a, colony, or, a, protectorate, it, was, still, heavily, controlled, by, foreign, powers, beginning, with, concessions, provided, by, the, qajar, shahs, and, leading, up, to, the, oil, agreement, signed, by, reza, shah, in, 1933, the, new, administration, introduced, a, wide, range, of, social, reforms, unemployment, compensation, was, introduced, factory, owners, were, ordered, to, pay, benefits, to, sick, and, injured, workers, and, peasants, were, freed, from, forced, labour, in, their, landlords, estates, in, 1952, mossadegh, passed, the, land, reform, act, which, forced, landlords, to, place, 20, of, their, revenue, into, a, development, fund, this, development, fund, paid, for, various, projects, such, as, public, baths, rural, housing, and, pest, control, on, 1, may, mosaddegh, nationalised, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, cancelling, its, oil, concession, which, was, otherwise, set, to, expire, in, 1993, and, expropriating, its, assets, mossadegh, saw, the, aioc, as, an, arm, of, the, british, government, controlling, much, of, the, oil, in, iran, pushing, him, to, seize, what, the, british, had, built, in, iran, the, next, month, a, committee, of, five, majlis, deputies, was, sent, to, khuzistan, to, enforce, the, nationalisation, mosaddegh, justified, his, nationalisation, policy, by, claiming, iran, was, the, rightful, owner, of, all, the, oil, in, iran, and, also, pointing, out, iran, could, use, the, money, in, a, 21, june, 1951, speech, our, long, years, of, negotiations, with, foreign, countries, have, yielded, no, results, thus, far, with, the, oil, revenues, we, could, meet, our, entire, budget, and, combat, poverty, disease, and, backwardness, among, our, people, another, important, consideration, is, that, by, the, elimination, of, the, power, of, the, british, company, we, would, also, eliminate, corruption, and, intrigue, by, means, of, which, the, internal, affairs, of, our, country, have, been, influenced, once, this, tutelage, has, ceased, iran, will, have, achieved, its, economic, and, political, independence, the, iranian, state, prefers, to, take, over, the, production, of, petroleum, itself, the, company, should, do, nothing, else, but, return, its, property, to, the, rightful, owners, the, nationalization, law, provides, that, 25, of, the, net, profits, on, oil, be, set, aside, to, meet, all, the, legitimate, claims, of, the, company, for, compensation, it, has, been, asserted, abroad, that, iran, intends, to, expel, the, foreign, oil, experts, from, the, country, and, then, shut, down, oil, installations, not, only, is, this, allegation, absurd, it, is, utter, invention, the, confrontation, between, iran, and, britain, escalated, as, mosaddegh, s, government, refused, to, allow, the, british, any, involvement, in, their, former, enterprise, and, britain, made, sure, iran, could, sell, no, oil, which, it, considered, stolen, in, july, mosaddegh, broke, off, negotiations, with, aioc, after, it, threatened, to, pull, out, its, employees, and, told, owners, of, oil, tanker, ships, that, receipts, from, the, iranian, government, would, not, be, accepted, on, the, world, market, two, months, later, the, aioc, evacuated, its, technicians, and, closed, down, the, oil, installations, under, nationalised, management, many, refineries, lacked, the, trained, technicians, that, were, needed, to, continue, production, the, british, government, announced, a, de, facto, blockade, and, embargo, reinforced, its, naval, force, in, the, persian, gulf, and, lodged, complaints, against, iran, before, the, united, nations, security, council, where, on, 15, october, 1951, mosaddegh, declared, that, the, petroleum, industry, has, contributed, nothing, to, well, being, of, the, people, or, to, the, technological, progress, or, industrial, development, of, my, country, the, british, government, also, threatened, legal, action, against, purchasers, of, oil, produced, in, the, iranian, refineries, and, obtained, an, agreement, with, its, sister, international, oil, companies, not, to, fill, in, where, the, aioc, was, boycotting, iran, the, entire, iranian, oil, industry, came, to, a, virtual, standstill, oil, production, dropping, almost, 96, from, 664, 000, barrels, 105, 600, m, 3, in, 1950, to, 27, 000, barrels, 4, 300, m, 3, in, 1952, this, abadan, crisis, reduced, iran, s, oil, income, to, almost, nothing, putting, a, severe, strain, on, the, implementation, of, mosaddegh, s, promised, domestic, reforms, at, the, same, time, bp, and, aramco, doubled, their, production, in, saudi, arabia, kuwait, and, iraq, to, make, up, for, lost, production, in, iran, so, that, no, hardship, was, felt, in, britain, still, enormously, popular, in, late, 1951, mosaddegh, called, elections, and, introduced, a, modified, version, of, his, 1944, electoral, reform, bill, as, his, base, of, support, was, in, urban, areas, and, not, in, the, provinces, the, proposed, reform, no, longer, barred, illiterate, voters, but, placed, them, into, a, separate, category, from, literate, voters, and, increased, the, representation, of, the, urban, population, the, opposition, defeated, the, bill, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, unjustly, discriminate, patriots, who, had, been, voting, for, the, last, forty, years, thus, leaving, the, national, front, to, compete, against, conservatives, royalists, and, tribal, leaders, alike, in, the, upcoming, election, his, government, came, under, scrutiny, for, ending, the, 1952, election, before, rural, votes, could, be, fully, counted, according, to, historian, ervand, abrahamian, realizing, that, the, opposition, would, take, the, vast, majority, of, the, provincial, seats, mosaddegh, stopped, the, voting, as, soon, as, 79, deputies, just, enough, to, form, a, parliamentary, quorum, had, been, elected, an, alternative, account, is, offered, by, journalist, stephen, kinzer, beginning, in, the, early, 1950s, under, the, guidance, of, c, m, woodhouse, chief, of, the, british, intelligence, station, in, tehran, britain, s, covert, operations, network, had, funnelled, roughly, 10, 000, per, month, to, the, rashidian, brothers, two, of, iran, s, most, influential, royalists, in, the, hope, of, buying, off, according, to, cia, estimates, the, armed, forces, the, majlis, iranian, parliament, religious, leaders, the, press, street, gangs, politicians, and, other, influential, figures, thus, in, his, statement, asserting, electoral, manipulation, by, foreign, agents, mosaddegh, suspended, the, elections, his, national, front, party, had, made, up, 30, of, the, 79, deputies, elected, yet, none, of, those, present, vetoed, the, statement, and, completion, of, the, elections, was, postponed, indefinitely, the, 17th, majlis, convened, in, april, 1952, with, the, minimum, required, of, the, 136, seats, filled, throughout, his, career, mosaddegh, strove, to, increase, the, power, parliament, held, versus, the, expansion, of, the, crown, s, authority, but, tension, soon, began, to, escalate, in, the, majlis, conservative, pro, shah, and, pro, british, opponents, refused, to, grant, mosaddegh, special, powers, to, deal, with, the, economic, crisis, caused, by, the, sharp, drop, in, revenue, and, voiced, regional, grievances, against, the, capital, tehran, while, the, national, front, waged, a, propaganda, war, against, the, landed, upper, class, on, 16, july, 1952, during, the, royal, approval, of, his, new, cabinet, mosaddegh, insisted, on, the, constitutional, prerogative, of, the, prime, minister, to, name, a, minister, of, war, and, the, chief, of, staff, something, the, shah, had, done, up, to, that, point, the, shah, refused, seeing, it, as, a, means, for, mosaddegh, to, consolidate, his, power, over, the, government, at, the, expense, of, the, monarchy, in, response, mosaddegh, announced, his, resignation, appealing, directly, to, the, public, for, support, pronouncing, that, in, the, present, situation, the, struggle, started, by, the, iranian, people, cannot, be, brought, to, a, victorious, conclusion, veteran, politician, ahmad, qavam, also, known, as, ghavam, os, saltaneh, was, appointed, as, iran, s, new, prime, minister, on, the, day, of, his, appointment, he, announced, his, intention, to, resume, negotiations, with, the, british, to, end, the, oil, dispute, a, reversal, of, mosaddegh, s, policy, the, national, front, along, with, various, nationalist, islamist, and, socialist, parties, and, groups, including, tudeh, responded, by, calling, for, protests, assassinations, of, the, shah, and, other, royalists, strikes, and, mass, demonstrations, in, favour, of, mosaddegh, major, strikes, broke, out, in, all, of, iran, s, major, towns, with, the, bazaar, closing, down, in, tehran, over, 250, demonstrators, in, tehran, hamadan, ahvaz, isfahan, and, kermanshah, were, killed, or, suffered, serious, injuries, on, the, fourth, day, of, mass, demonstrations, ayatollah, abol, ghasem, kashani, called, on, the, people, to, wage, a, holy, war, against, qavam, the, following, day, si, ye, tir, the, 30th, of, tir, on, the, iranian, calendar, military, commanders, ordered, their, troops, back, to, barracks, fearful, of, over, straining, the, enlisted, men, s, loyalty, and, left, tehran, in, the, hands, of, the, protesters, frightened, by, the, unrest, shah, asked, for, qavam, s, resignation, and, re, appointed, mosaddegh, to, form, a, government, granting, him, control, over, the, ministry, of, war, he, had, previously, demanded, the, shah, asked, whether, he, should, step, down, as, monarch, but, mosaddegh, declined, more, popular, than, ever, a, greatly, strengthened, mosaddegh, introduced, a, single, clause, bill, to, parliament, to, grant, him, emergency, dictatorial, decree, powers, for, six, months, to, pass, any, law, he, felt, necessary, for, obtaining, not, only, financial, solvency, but, also, electoral, judicial, and, educational, reforms, in, order, to, implement, his, nine, point, reform, program, to, bypass, the, stalled, negotiations, of, the, nationalisation, of, the, oil, industry, on, 3, august, 1952, the, majlis, voted, in, approval, and, elected, ayatollah, kashani, as, house, speaker, kashani, s, islamic, scholars, as, well, as, the, tudeh, party, proved, to, be, two, of, mosaddegh, s, key, political, allies, although, relations, with, both, were, often, strained, in, addition, to, the, reform, program, which, intended, to, make, changes, to, a, broad, region, of, laws, covering, elections, financial, institutions, employment, the, judiciary, the, press, education, health, and, communications, services, mosaddegh, tried, to, limit, the, monarchy, s, powers, cutting, the, shah, s, personal, budget, forbidding, him, to, communicate, directly, with, foreign, diplomats, transferring, royal, lands, back, to, the, state, and, expelling, the, shah, s, politically, active, sister, ashraf, pahlavi, however, six, months, proved, not, long, enough, and, mosaddegh, asked, for, an, extension, in, january, 1953, successfully, pressing, parliament, to, extend, his, emergency, powers, for, another, 12, months, though, the, shah, had, only, initiated, land, reform, in, january, 1951, where, all, territory, inherited, by, the, crown, was, sold, to, peasants, at, 20, of, the, assessed, value, over, a, payment, period, of, 25, years, mosaddegh, decreed, a, new, land, reform, law, to, supersede, it, establishing, village, councils, and, increasing, the, peasants, share, of, production, this, weakened, the, landed, aristocracy, by, imposing, a, 20, tax, on, their, income, of, which, 20, was, diverted, back, to, the, crop, sharing, tenants, and, their, rural, banks, and, also, by, levying, heavy, fines, for, compelling, peasants, to, work, without, wages, mosaddegh, attempted, to, abolish, iran, s, centuries, old, feudal, agriculture, sector, by, replacing, it, with, a, system, of, collective, farming, and, government, land, ownership, which, centralised, power, in, his, government, ann, lambton, indicates, that, mosaddegh, saw, this, as, a, means, of, checking, the, power, of, the, tudeh, party, which, had, been, agitating, the, peasants, by, criticising, his, lack, of, land, reform, however, during, this, time, iranians, were, becoming, poorer, and, unhappier, by, the, day, in, large, part, due, to, the, british, led, boycott, as, mosaddegh, s, political, coalition, began, to, fray, his, enemies, increased, in, number, partly, through, the, efforts, of, iranians, sympathising, with, the, british, and, partly, in, fear, of, the, growing, dictatorial, powers, of, the, prime, minister, several, former, members, of, mosaddegh, s, coalition, turned, against, him, fearing, arrest, they, included, mozzafar, baghai, head, of, the, worker, based, toilers, party, hossein, makki, who, had, helped, lead, the, takeover, of, the, abadan, refinery, and, was, at, one, point, considered, mosaddegh, s, heir, apparent, and, most, outspokenly, ayatollah, kashani, who, damned, mosaddegh, with, the, vitriol, he, had, once, reserved, for, the, british, the, reason, for, difference, of, opinion, among, makki, and, mosaddegh, was, the, sharp, response, of, mosaddegh, to, kashani, who, was, an, inoffensive, scholar, who, attracted, public, support, hossein, makki, strongly, opposed, the, dissolution, of, the, parliament, by, mossadegh, and, evaluated, in, the, long, run, at, his, loss, because, with, the, closure, of, the, parliament, the, right, to, dismiss, the, prime, minister, was, made, by, the, shah, the, british, government, had, grown, increasingly, distressed, over, mosaddegh, s, policies, and, were, especially, bitter, over, the, loss, of, their, control, of, the, iranian, oil, industry, repeated, attempts, to, reach, a, settlement, had, failed, and, in, october, 1952, mosaddegh, declared, britain, an, enemy, and, cut, all, diplomatic, relations, since, 1935, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, had, the, exclusive, rights, to, iranian, oil, earlier, in, 1914, the, british, government, had, purchased, 51, of, its, shares, and, became, the, majority, shareholder, after, the, british, royal, navy, converted, its, ships, to, use, oil, as, fuel, the, corporation, was, considered, vital, to, british, national, security, and, the, company, s, profits, partially, alleviated, britain, s, budget, deficit, engulfed, in, a, variety, of, problems, following, world, war, ii, britain, was, unable, to, resolve, the, issue, single, handedly, and, looked, towards, the, united, states, to, settle, the, matter, initially, the, us, had, opposed, british, policies, after, mediation, had, failed, several, times, to, bring, about, a, settlement, american, secretary, of, state, dean, acheson, concluded, that, the, british, were, destructive, and, determined, on, a, rule, or, ruin, policy, in, iran, the, american, position, shifted, in, late, 1952, when, dwight, d, eisenhower, was, elected, president, in, november, and, december, british, intelligence, officials, suggested, to, american, intelligence, that, the, iranian, prime, minister, should, be, ousted, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, suggested, to, the, incoming, eisenhower, administration, that, mosaddegh, despite, the, latter, s, open, dislike, of, communism, would, become, reliant, on, the, pro, soviet, tudeh, party, resulting, in, iran, increasingly, turning, towards, communism, and, towards, the, soviet, sphere, at, a, time, of, high, cold, war, fears, though, his, suggestion, was, rebuffed, by, eisenhower, as, paternalistic, churchill, s, government, had, already, begun, operation, boot, and, simply, waited, for, the, next, opportunity, to, press, the, americans, on, 28, february, 1953, rumours, spread, by, british, backed, iranians, that, mosaddegh, was, trying, to, exile, the, shah, from, the, country, gave, the, eisenhower, administration, the, impetus, to, join, the, plan, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, agreed, to, work, together, toward, mosaddegh, s, removal, and, began, to, publicly, denounce, mosaddegh, s, policies, for, iran, as, harmful, to, the, country, in, the, meantime, the, already, precarious, alliance, between, mosaddegh, and, kashani, was, severed, in, january, 1953, when, kashani, opposed, mosaddegh, s, demand, that, his, increased, powers, be, extended, for, a, period, of, one, year, finally, to, end, mossadegh, s, destabilising, influence, that, threatened, the, supply, of, oil, to, the, west, and, could, potentially, pave, the, way, for, a, communist, takeover, of, the, country, the, us, made, an, attempt, to, depose, him, in, march, 1953, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, directed, the, cia, which, was, headed, by, his, younger, brother, allen, dulles, to, draft, plans, to, overthrow, mossadegh, on, 4, april, 1953, dulles, approved, 1, million, to, be, used, in, any, way, that, would, bring, about, the, fall, of, mosaddegh, soon, the, cia, s, tehran, station, started, to, launch, a, propaganda, campaign, against, mossadegh, finally, according, to, the, new, york, times, in, early, june, american, and, british, intelligence, officials, met, again, this, time, in, beirut, and, put, the, finishing, touches, on, the, strategy, soon, afterward, according, to, his, later, published, accounts, the, chief, of, the, cia, s, near, east, and, africa, division, kermit, roosevelt, jr, the, grandson, of, us, president, theodore, roosevelt, arrived, in, tehran, to, direct, it, in, 2000, the, new, york, times, made, partial, publication, of, a, leaked, cia, document, titled, clandestine, service, history, overthrow, of, premier, mosaddegh, of, iran, november, 1952, august, 1953, the, plot, known, as, operation, ajax, centered, on, convincing, iran, s, monarch, to, issue, a, decree, to, dismiss, mosaddegh, from, office, as, he, had, attempted, some, months, earlier, but, the, shah, was, terrified, to, attempt, such, a, dangerously, unpopular, and, risky, move, against, mosaddegh, it, would, take, much, persuasion, and, many, us, funded, meetings, which, included, bribing, his, sister, ashraf, with, a, mink, coat, and, money, to, successfully, change, his, mind, mosaddegh, became, aware, of, the, plots, against, him, and, grew, increasingly, wary, of, conspirators, acting, within, his, government, according, to, donald, wilber, who, was, involved, in, the, plot, to, remove, mossadegh, from, power, in, early, august, iranian, cia, operatives, pretending, to, be, socialists, and, nationalists, threatened, muslim, leaders, with, savage, punishment, if, they, opposed, mossadegh, thereby, giving, the, impression, that, mossadegh, was, cracking, down, on, dissent, earlier, than, planned, and, stirring, anti, mossadegh, sentiments, within, the, religious, community, a, referendum, to, dissolve, parliament, and, give, the, prime, minister, power, to, make, law, was, submitted, to, voters, and, it, passed, with, 99, per, cent, approval, 2, 043, 300, votes, to, 1300, votes, against, according, to, historian, mark, gasiorowski, there, were, separate, polling, stations, for, yes, and, no, votes, producing, sharp, criticism, of, mosaddeq, and, that, the, controversial, referendum, gave, the, cia, s, precoup, propaganda, campaign, to, show, up, mosaddeq, as, an, anti, democratic, dictator, an, easy, target, on, or, around, 16, august, parliament, was, suspended, indefinitely, and, mosaddeq, s, emergency, powers, were, extended, declassified, documents, released, by, the, cia, in, 2017, revealed, that, after, the, shah, had, fled, to, italy, cia, headquarters, believed, the, coup, to, have, failed, following, the, initial, failed, coup, by, the, foreign, backed, general, fazlollah, zahedi, the, cia, sent, roosevelt, a, telegram, on, 18, august, 1953, telling, him, to, flee, iran, immediately, but, roosevelt, ignored, it, and, began, work, on, the, second, coup, circulating, a, false, account, that, mossadegh, attempted, to, seize, the, throne, and, bribed, iranian, agents, soon, massive, popular, protests, aided, by, roosevelt, s, team, took, place, across, the, city, and, elsewhere, with, tribesmen, at, the, ready, to, assist, the, coup, with, anti, and, pro, monarchy, protesters, both, being, paid, by, roosevelt, by, paying, mobs, to, demonstrate, tricking, mossadegh, into, urging, his, supporters, to, stay, home, and, bribing, and, mobilising, officers, against, mossadegh, he, was, able, to, force, a, military, confrontation, outside, mossadegh, s, home, the, protests, turned, increasingly, violent, leaving, almost, 300, dead, at, which, point, the, pro, monarchy, leadership, led, by, retired, army, general, and, former, minister, of, interior, in, mosaddegh, s, cabinet, fazlollah, zahedi, interceded, joined, with, underground, figures, such, as, the, rashidian, brothers, and, local, strongman, shaban, jafari, pro, shah, tank, regiments, stormed, the, capital, and, bombarded, the, prime, minister, s, official, residence, with, loyalist, troops, overwhelmed, mossadegh, was, taken, into, hiding, by, his, aides, narrowly, escaping, the, mob, that, set, in, to, ransack, his, house, the, following, day, he, surrendered, himself, at, the, officers, club, where, general, zahedi, had, been, set, up, with, makeshift, headquarters, by, the, cia, zahedi, announced, an, order, for, his, arrest, on, the, radio, and, mosaddegh, was, transferred, to, a, military, jail, shortly, after, the, shah, finally, agreed, to, mossadegh, s, overthrow, after, roosevelt, said, that, the, united, states, would, proceed, with, or, without, him, and, formally, dismissed, the, prime, minister, in, a, written, decree, an, act, that, had, been, made, part, of, the, constitution, during, the, constitutional, assembly, of, 1949, convened, under, martial, law, at, which, time, the, power, of, the, monarchy, was, increased, in, various, ways, by, the, shah, himself, as, a, precautionary, measure, he, flew, to, baghdad, and, from, there, hid, safely, in, rome, he, actually, signed, two, decrees, one, dismissing, mosaddegh, and, the, other, nominating, the, cia, s, choice, general, zahedi, as, prime, minister, these, decrees, called, farm, ns, played, a, major, role, in, giving, legitimacy, to, the, coup, and, were, further, spread, by, cia, officials, on, 22, august, the, shah, returned, from, rome, zahedi, s, new, government, soon, reached, an, agreement, with, foreign, oil, companies, to, form, a, consortium, and, restore, the, flow, of, iranian, oil, to, world, markets, in, substantial, quantities, giving, the, united, states, and, great, britain, the, lion, s, share, of, the, restored, british, holdings, in, return, the, us, massively, funded, the, shah, s, resulting, government, until, the, shah, s, overthrow, in, 1979, as, soon, as, the, coup, succeeded, many, of, mosaddegh, s, former, associates, and, supporters, were, tried, imprisoned, and, tortured, some, were, sentenced, to, death, and, executed, the, minister, of, foreign, affairs, and, the, closest, associate, of, mosaddegh, hossein, fatemi, was, executed, by, order, of, the, shah, s, military, court, the, order, was, carried, out, by, firing, squad, on, 10, november, 1954, on, 21, december, 1953, mossadegh, was, sentenced, to, three, years, solitary, confinement, in, a, military, prison, well, short, of, the, death, sentence, requested, by, prosecutors, after, hearing, the, sentence, mossadegh, was, reported, to, have, said, with, a, calm, voice, of, sarcasm, the, verdict, of, this, court, has, increased, my, historical, glories, i, am, extremely, grateful, you, convicted, me, truly, tonight, the, iranian, nation, understood, the, meaning, of, constitutionalism, mossadegh, was, kept, under, house, arrest, at, his, ahmadabad, residence, until, his, death, on, 5, march, 1967, he, was, denied, a, funeral, and, was, buried, in, his, living, room, despite, his, request, to, be, buried, in, the, public, graveyard, beside, the, victims, of, the, political, violence, on, 30, tir, 1331, 21, july, 1952, although, mosaddegh, was, never, directly, elected, as, prime, minister, he, enjoyed, massive, popularity, throughout, most, of, his, career, despite, beginning, to, fall, out, of, favour, during, the, later, stages, of, the, abadan, crisis, the, secret, u, s, overthrow, of, mosaddegh, served, as, a, rallying, point, in, anti, us, protests, during, the, 1979, iranian, revolution, and, to, this, day, he, is, one, of, the, most, popular, figures, in, iranian, history, the, withdrawal, of, support, for, mosaddegh, by, the, powerful, shia, clergy, has, been, regarded, as, having, been, motivated, by, their, fear, of, a, communist, takeover, some, argue, that, while, many, elements, of, mosaddegh, s, coalition, abandoned, him, it, was, the, loss, of, support, from, ayatollah, abol, ghasem, kashani, and, another, cleric, that, was, fatal, to, his, cause, reflective, of, the, dominance, of, the, ulema, in, iranian, society, and, a, portent, of, the, islamic, revolution, to, come, the, loss, of, the, political, clerics, effectively, cut, mosaddegh, s, connections, with, the, lower, middle, classes, and, the, iranian, masses, which, are, crucial, to, any, popular, movement, in, iran, on, march, 5, 1979, not, even, a, month, after, the, shah, was, deposed, hundreds, of, thousands, of, iranians, marked, the, 12th, anniversary, of, mossadegh, s, death, in, ahmadabad, where, he, was, buried, iranian, leaders, and, politicians, eulogized, him, in, a, way, that, would, ve, been, unthinkable, before, the, shah, s, removal, it, was, estimated, that, the, crowd, in, size, was, over, one, million, the, event, was, described, as, for, sixty, solid, miles, the, highway, from, tehran, to, mossadeq, s, burial, site, transformed, into, a, massive, unbroken, daisy, chain, of, cars, in, the, final, seven, or, eight, miles, approaching, the, village, traffic, became, so, gridlocked, that, mourners, were, forced, to, complete, the, journey, on, foot, the, u, s, role, in, mosaddegh, s, overthrow, was, not, formally, acknowledged, for, many, years, although, the, eisenhower, administration, vehemently, opposed, mossadegh, s, policies, president, eisenhower, wrote, angrily, about, mosaddegh, in, his, memoirs, describing, him, as, impractical, and, naive, eventually, the, cia, s, involvement, with, the, coup, was, exposed, this, caused, controversy, within, the, organisation, and, the, cia, congressional, hearings, of, the, 1970s, cia, supporters, maintained, that, the, coup, was, strategically, necessary, and, praised, the, efficiency, of, the, agents, responsible, critics, say, the, scheme, was, paranoid, colonial, illegal, and, immoral, and, truly, caused, the, blowback, suggested, in, the, pre, coup, analysis, the, extent, of, this, blowback, over, time, was, not, completely, clear, to, the, cia, as, they, had, an, inaccurate, picture, of, the, stability, of, the, shah, s, regime, the, iranian, revolution, of, 1979, caught, the, cia, and, the, u, s, very, much, off, guard, as, cia, reporting, a, mere, month, earlier, predicted, no, imminent, insurrectionary, turbulence, whatsoever, for, the, shah, s, regime, and, resulted, in, the, overthrow, of, the, shah, by, a, fundamentalist, faction, opposed, to, the, u, s, headed, by, ayatollah, khomeini, in, retrospect, not, only, did, the, cia, and, the, u, s, underestimate, the, extent, of, popular, discontent, for, the, shah, but, much, of, that, discontent, historically, stemmed, from, the, removal, of, mosaddegh, and, the, subsequent, clientelism, of, the, shah, in, march, 2000, secretary, of, state, madeleine, albright, stated, her, regret, that, mosaddegh, was, ousted, the, eisenhower, administration, believed, its, actions, were, justified, for, strategic, reasons, but, the, coup, was, clearly, a, setback, for, iran, s, political, development, and, it, is, easy, to, see, now, why, many, iranians, continue, to, resent, this, intervention, by, america, in, the, same, year, the, new, york, times, published, a, detailed, report, about, the, coup, based, on, declassified, cia, documents, mosaddegh, s, overthrow, had, a, direct, relationship, with, the, creation, of, an, islamic, revolution, and, the, collapse, of, the, pahlavi, government, america, s, close, relationship, with, the, shah, and, the, subsequent, hostility, of, the, united, states, to, the, islamic, republic, and, britain, s, profitable, interventions, caused, pessimism, for, iranians, stirring, nationalism, and, suspicion, of, foreign, interference
