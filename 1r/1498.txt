nephew, godfrey, of, bouillon, as, his, heir, and, next, in, line, to, his, duchy, of, lower, lorraine, this, duchy, was, an, important, one, at, the, time, serving, as, a, buffer, between, the, french, kingdom, and, the, german, lands, in, fact, lower, lorraine, was, so, important, to, the, holy, roman, empire, that, in, 1076, henry, iv, reigned, 1056, 1105, then, king, of, the, romans, and, future, emperor, decided, to, place, it, in, the, hands, of, his, own, son, and, give, godfrey, only, bouillon, and, the, margraviate, of, antwerp, allegedly, as, a, test, of, his, loyalty, godfrey, supported, henry, even, during, his, struggle, with, pope, gregory, vii, during, the, investiture, controversy, godfrey, fought, alongside, henry, and, his, forces, against, rudolf, of, swabia, and, in, italy, when, henry, captured, rome, itself, a, major, test, of, godfrey, s, leadership, skills, was, shown, in, his, battles, to, defend, his, inheritance, against, a, significant, array, of, enemies, in, 1076, he, had, succeeded, as, designated, heir, to, the, lotharingian, lands, of, his, uncle, godfrey, the, hunchback, and, godfrey, was, struggling, to, maintain, control, over, the, lands, that, henry, iv, had, not, taken, away, from, him, claims, were, raised, by, his, aunt, margravine, matilda, of, tuscany, cousin, count, albert, iii, of, namur, and, count, theoderic, of, veluwe, this, coalition, was, joined, by, bishop, theoderic, of, verdun, and, two, minor, counts, attempting, to, share, in, the, spoils, waleran, i, of, limburg, and, arnold, i, of, chiny, as, these, enemies, tried, to, take, away, portions, of, his, land, godfrey, s, brothers, eustace, and, baldwin, both, came, to, his, aid, following, these, long, struggles, and, proving, that, he, was, a, loyal, vassal, to, henry, iv, godfrey, finally, gained, lower, lorraine, in, 1087, in, 1095, pope, urban, ii, called, for, military, action, in, order, to, liberate, jerusalem, and, aid, the, byzantine, empire, which, in, the, years, since, 1071, had, lost, large, swathes, of, territory, to, the, seljuk, empire, godfrey, either, sold, or, mortgaged, most, of, his, estates, to, the, bishops, of, li, ge, and, verdun, and, used, the, money, to, recruit, an, army, of, crusaders, he, was, joined, by, his, older, brother, eustace, and, his, younger, brother, baldwin, who, had, no, lands, in, europe, and, was, seeking, them, in, the, holy, land, others, did, the, same, the, largest, being, that, raised, by, raymond, iv, count, of, toulouse, who, at, 55, was, the, oldest, and, most, experienced, of, the, crusader, nobles, as, a, result, he, expected, to, lead, the, expedition, a, claim, boosted, by, the, presence, of, adhemar, of, le, puy, the, papal, legate, who, travelled, with, him, significant, forces, also, accompanied, bohemond, of, taranto, a, norman, knight, from, southern, italy, and, robert, ii, count, of, flanders, following, advice, provided, by, pope, urban, most, of, these, armies, set, out, in, mid, summer, and, headed, for, constantinople, where, they, could, expect, assistance, from, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, each, travelled, separately, since, it, was, impossible, for, one, region, to, feed, and, supply, such, large, numbers, on, their, own, the, first, to, leave, in, spring, 1096, was, what, became, known, as, the, people, s, crusade, an, army, of, 20, 000, low, ranking, knights, and, peasants, which, journeyed, through, the, rhineland, then, headed, for, hungary, most, of, those, from, southern, and, northern, france, sailed, from, brindisi, across, the, adriatic, sea, while, godfrey, and, his, two, brothers, leading, an, army, from, lorraine, reportedly, 40, 000, strong, set, out, in, august, 1096, following, the, route, taken, by, the, people, s, crusade, pope, urban, ii, s, call, for, the, crusade, spurred, a, wave, of, violence, against, jews, across, europe, beginning, with, rouen, in, december, 1095, in, the, spring, and, early, summer, of, 1096, members, of, the, people, s, crusade, plundered, and, massacred, jewish, communities, during, the, rhineland, massacres, after, the, people, s, crusade, entered, hungary, in, june, a, series, of, incidents, had, culminated, in, a, full, scale, battle, with, their, hosts, and, the, deaths, of, over, 10, 000, crusaders, as, a, result, when, godfrey, and, his, troops, approached, the, border, in, september, it, took, several, days, of, negotiations, before, they, were, allowed, in, he, finally, reached, constantinople, in, november, shortly, after, those, led, by, hugh, of, vermandois, while, others, arrived, over, the, next, few, months, unlike, the, limited, numbers, he, had, anticipated, by, may, 1097, alexios, found, himself, with, over, 4, 000, to, 8, 000, mounted, knights, and, 25, 000, to, 55, 000, infantry, camped, on, his, doorstep, this, mattered, because, the, two, sides, had, different, goals, alexius, simply, wanted, help, in, retaking, byzantine, lands, lost, to, the, seljuk, turks, while, the, crusaders, sought, to, liberate, the, holy, land, from, the, muslims, when, alexios, demanded, an, oath, of, loyalty, godfrey, and, most, of, the, crusaders, agreed, a, modified, version, in, which, they, promised, to, restore, some, lands, to, the, emperor, raymond, of, toulouse, being, a, notable, exception, he, would, just, promise, to, do, the, emperor, no, harm, in, february, 1097, godfrey, and, his, army, crossed, the, bosporus, straits, where, he, was, joined, by, bohemund, robert, of, flanders, and, hugh, of, vermandois, accompanied, by, byzantine, soldiers, in, early, may, the, crusaders, invested, nicaea, a, city, close, to, constantinople, captured, by, the, turks, in, 1085, godfrey, and, his, troops, played, a, minor, role, with, bohemond, successfully, commanding, much, of, the, action, but, as, the, crusaders, were, about, to, storm, the, city, they, noticed, the, byzantine, flag, flying, from, the, top, of, the, walls, wanting, to, minimise, damage, to, what, was, an, important, byzantine, city, and, suspecting, the, crusaders, would, demand, a, heavy, ransom, for, handing, it, over, alexios, had, made, a, separate, peace, with, the, turkish, garrison, although, the, majority, of, the, crusader, leaders, accepted, alexios, right, to, do, so, it, was, an, illustration, of, the, level, of, mutual, suspicion, between, the, two, sides, godfrey, continued, to, play, a, minor, yet, significant, role, in, the, battles, against, the, seljuks, until, the, crusaders, finally, reached, jerusalem, in, 1099, at, dorylaeum, in, july, 1097, he, helped, relieve, the, vanguard, at, dorylaeum, which, had, been, pinned, down, by, a, turkish, force, under, kilij, arslan, i, then, sacked, their, camp, after, this, battle, and, during, the, trek, through, asia, minor, some, sources, suggest, that, godfrey, was, attacked, by, a, bear, and, received, a, serious, wound, which, incapacitated, him, for, a, time, godfrey, also, took, part, in, the, siege, of, antioch, which, began, in, october, 1097, and, did, not, surrender, until, june, 1098, after, long, and, bitter, fighting, during, the, winter, the, crusading, army, came, close, to, starvation, and, many, returned, to, europe, while, alexios, assumed, all, was, lost, at, antioch, and, failed, to, provide, them, with, supplies, as, promised, when, the, city, finally, fell, bohemond, claimed, it, for, himself, and, refused, to, hand, it, over, to, the, emperor, citing, the, emperor, s, failure, to, help, the, crusaders, at, antioch, as, breaking, the, oath, after, repulsing, a, muslim, force, from, mosul, led, by, kerbogha, antioch, was, secured, after, this, victory, the, crusaders, were, divided, over, their, next, course, of, action, the, bishop, of, le, puy, had, died, at, antioch, bohemond, decided, to, remain, behind, in, order, to, secure, his, new, principality, and, godfrey, s, younger, brother, baldwin, also, decided, to, stay, in, the, north, in, the, crusader, state, he, had, established, at, edessa, most, of, the, foot, soldiers, wanted, to, continue, south, to, jerusalem, but, raymond, iv, of, toulouse, by, this, time, the, most, powerful, of, the, princes, having, taken, others, into, his, employ, such, as, tancred, hesitated, to, continue, the, march, after, months, of, waiting, the, common, people, on, the, crusade, forced, raymond, to, march, on, to, jerusalem, and, godfrey, quickly, joined, him, as, they, travelled, south, into, palestine, the, crusaders, faced, a, new, enemy, no, longer, were, the, seljuk, turks, the, rulers, of, these, lands, now, the, christian, army, had, to, deal, with, armies, of, north, african, muslims, called, fatimids, who, had, adopted, the, name, of, the, ruling, family, in, cairo, egypt, the, fatimids, had, taken, jerusalem, in, august, 1098, the, crusaders, would, be, battling, them, for, the, final, prize, of, the, first, crusade, in, the, siege, of, jerusalem, it, was, in, jerusalem, that, the, legend, of, godfrey, of, bouillon, was, born, the, army, reached, the, city, in, june, 1099, and, built, a, wooden, siege, tower, from, lumber, provided, by, some, italian, sailors, who, intentionally, scrapped, their, ships, to, get, over, the, walls, the, major, attack, took, place, on, 14, and, 15, july, 1099, godfrey, and, some, of, his, knights, were, the, first, to, take, the, walls, and, enter, the, city, it, was, an, end, to, three, years, of, fighting, by, the, crusaders, but, they, had, finally, achieved, what, they, had, set, out, to, do, in, 1096, to, recapture, the, holy, land, and, in, particular, the, city, of, jerusalem, and, its, holy, sites, such, as, the, holy, sepulchre, the, empty, tomb, of, jesus, christ, godfrey, endowed, the, hospital, in, the, muristan, after, the, first, crusade, once, the, city, was, returned, to, christian, rule, some, form, of, government, had, to, be, set, up, on, 22, july, 1099, a, council, was, held, in, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, after, raymond, of, toulouse, had, refused, the, crown, godfrey, agreed, to, become, ruler, however, he, preferred, the, title, advocate, of, the, holy, sepulchre, to, that, of, king, allegedly, refusing, to, wear, a, crown, of, gold, where, his, saviour, had, worn, a, crown, of, thorns, both, the, meaning, and, usage, of, his, title, is, disputed, some, of, the, original, chroniclers, used, the, more, ambiguous, term, princeps, or, his, previous, rank, of, duke, later, chroniclers, who, did, not, participate, in, the, first, crusade, suggest, he, took, the, title, of, rex, or, king, during, his, short, reign, godfrey, had, to, defend, the, new, kingdom, against, the, fatimids, of, egypt, who, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, ascalon, in, august, he, also, faced, opposition, from, dagobert, of, pisa, the, latin, patriarch, of, jerusalem, who, was, allied, with, tancred, although, the, latins, came, close, to, capturing, ascalon, godfrey, s, attempts, to, prevent, raymond, of, st, gilles, from, securing, the, city, for, himself, meant, that, the, town, remained, in, muslim, hands, destined, to, be, a, thorn, in, the, new, kingdom, s, side, for, years, to, come, in, 1100, godfrey, was, unable, to, directly, expand, his, new, territories, through, conquest, however, his, impressive, victory, in, 1099, and, his, subsequent, campaigning, in, 1100, meant, that, he, was, able, to, force, acre, ascalon, arsuf, jaffa, and, caesarea, to, become, tributaries, meanwhile, the, struggle, with, dagobert, continued, although, the, terms, of, the, conflict, are, difficult, to, trace, dagobert, may, well, have, envisaged, turning, jerusalem, into, a, fiefdom, of, the, pope, but, his, full, intentions, are, not, clear, much, of, the, evidence, for, this, comes, from, william, of, tyre, whose, account, of, these, events, is, troublesome, it, is, only, william, who, tells, us, that, dagobert, forced, godfrey, to, concede, jerusalem, and, jaffa, while, other, writers, such, as, albert, of, aachen, and, ralph, of, caen, suggest, that, both, dagobert, and, his, ally, tancred, had, sworn, an, oath, to, godfrey, to, accept, only, one, of, his, brothers, or, blood, relations, as, his, successor, whatever, dagobert, s, schemes, they, were, destined, to, come, to, naught, being, at, haifa, at, the, time, of, godfrey, s, death, he, could, do, nothing, to, stop, godfrey, s, supporters, led, by, warner, of, grez, from, seizing, jerusalem, and, demanding, that, godfrey, s, brother, baldwin, should, succeed, to, the, rule, dagobert, was, subsequently, forced, to, crown, baldwin, as, the, first, latin, king, of, jerusalem, on, 25, december, 1100, the, arab, chronicler, ibn, al, qalanisi, reported, that, in, this, year, godfrey, lord, of, jerusalem, appeared, before, the, fortified, port, of, akk, and, made, an, assault, upon, it, but, was, struck, by, an, arrow, which, killed, him, while, this, claim, is, repeated, in, other, muslim, sources, it, does, not, appear, in, christian, chronicles, albert, of, aix, and, ekkehard, of, aura, suggest, godfrey, fell, ill, while, visiting, caesarea, in, june, 1100, and, died, in, jerusalem, on, 18, july, suggestions, he, was, poisoned, are, unlikely, and, it, is, more, probable, he, died, from, a, disease, similar, to, typhoid, godfrey, never, married, according, to, william, of, tyre, the, later, 12th, century, chronicler, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, godfrey, was, tall, of, stature, not, extremely, so, but, still, taller, than, the, average, man, he, was, strong, beyond, compare, with, solidly, built, limbs, and, a, stalwart, chest, his, features, were, pleasing, his, beard, and, hair, of, medium, blond, as, the, first, ruler, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, and, one, of, those, who, had, taken, part, in, its, capture, godfrey, was, idealized, in, later, accounts, he, was, depicted, as, the, military, leader, of, the, crusade, a, legislator, who, established, the, assizes, of, jerusalem, and, in, the, early, 14th, century, was, selected, as, one, of, the, nine, worthies, a, pantheon, of, famous, warriors, thought, to, epitomise, chivalric, ideals, in, reality, godfrey, was, only, one, of, several, leaders, of, the, crusade, which, also, included, raymond, iv, of, toulouse, bohemond, of, taranto, robert, of, flanders, stephen, of, blois, and, baldwin, of, boulogne, to, name, a, few, along, with, papal, legate, adhemar, of, montiel, bishop, of, le, puy, baldwin, i, of, jerusalem, godfrey, s, younger, brother, became, the, first, titled, king, when, he, succeeded, godfrey, in, 1100, the, assizes, were, the, result, of, a, gradual, development, godfrey, s, role, in, the, crusade, was, described, by, various, authors, including, raymond, of, aguilers, and, albert, of, aix, anonymous, author, of, the, gesta, francorum, in, fiction, he, was, the, hero, of, the, crusade, cycle, a, collection, of, french, chansons, de, geste, dealing, with, the, first, crusade, which, connected, him, to, the, legend, of, the, knight, of, the, swan, most, famous, today, as, the, storyline, of, wagner, s, opera, lohengrin, by, william, of, tyre, s, time, later, in, the, 12th, century, godfrey, was, already, a, legend, among, the, descendants, of, the, original, crusaders, godfrey, was, believed, to, have, possessed, immense, physical, strength, it, was, said, that, in, cilicia, he, wrestled, a, bear, and, won, and, that, he, once, beheaded, a, camel, with, one, blow, of, his, sword, since, the, mid, 19th, century, an, equestrian, statue, of, godfrey, of, bouillon, has, stood, in, the, centre, of, the, place, royale, koningsplein, in, brussels, belgium, it, was, made, by, eug, ne, simonis, and, inaugurated, on, 24, august, 1848, godfrey, is, a, key, figure, in, the, pseudohistorical, theories, put, forth, in, the, books, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, and, the, da, vinci, code, in, 2005, godfrey, came, in, 17th, place, in, the, french, language, le, plus, grand, belge, a, public, vote, of, national, heroes, in, belgium, he, did, not, make, the, 100, greatest, belgians, as, voted, by, the, dutch, speakers, in, de, grootste, belg, the, greatest, belgian
