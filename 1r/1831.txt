them, all, stating, that, he, was, content, to, stay, in, his, homeland, of, jamaica, bolt, instead, chose, the, surroundings, of, the, university, of, technology, jamaica, as, his, professional, training, ground, staying, with, the, university, s, track, and, weight, room, that, had, served, him, well, in, his, amateur, years, the, year, 2005, signalled, a, fresh, start, for, bolt, in, the, form, of, a, new, coach, glen, mills, and, a, new, attitude, toward, athletics, mills, recognised, bolt, s, potential, and, aimed, to, cease, what, he, considered, an, unprofessional, approach, to,

at, the, major, tournaments, in, 2007, but, mills, felt, that, bolt, s, technique, was, much, improved, pinpointing, improvements, in, bolt, s, balance, at, the, turns, over, 200, m, and, an, increase, in, his, stride, frequency, giving, him, more, driving, power, on, the, track, the, silver, medals, from, the, 2007, osaka, world, championships, boosted, bolt, s, desire, to, sprint, and,

165, s, this, was, an, improvement, upon, his, own, world, record, and, he, was, well, ahead, of, second, place, finisher, richard, thompson, who, finished, in, 9, 89, s, not, only, was, the, record, set, with, no, favourable, wind, 0, 0, m, s, but, he, also, visibly, slowed, down, to, celebrate, before, he, finished, and, his, shoelace, was, untied, bolt, s, coach, reported, that, based, upon, the, speed, of, bolt, s, opening, 60, m, he, could, have, finished, with, a, time, of, 9, 52, s, after, scientific, analysis, of, bolt, s, run, by, the, institute, of, theoretical, astrophysics, at, the, university, of, oslo, hans, eriksen, and, his, colleagues, also, predicted, a, sub, 9, 60, s, time, considering, factors, such, as, bolt, s, position, acceleration, and, velocity, in, comparison, with, second, place, finisher, thompson, the, team, estimated, that, bolt, could, have, finished, in, 9, 55, 0, 04, s, had, he, not, slowed, to, celebrate, before, the, finishing, line, bolt, stated, that, setting, a, world, record, was, not, a, priority, for, him, and, that, his, goal, was, just, to, win, the, gold, medal, jamaica, s, first, of, the, 2008, games, olympic, medallist, kriss, akabusi, construed, bolt, s, chest, slapping, before, the, finish, line, as, showboating, noting, that, the, actions, cost, bolt, an, even, faster, record, time, ioc, president, jacques, rogge, also, condemned, the, jamaican, s, actions, as, disrespectful, bolt, denied, that, this, was, the, purpose, of, his, celebration, by, saying, i, wasn, t, bragging, when, i, saw, i, wasn, t, covered, i, was, just, happy, lamine, diack, president, of, the, iaaf, supported, bolt, and, said, that, his, celebration, was, appropriate, given, the, circumstances, of, his, victory, jamaican, government, minister, edmund, bartlett, also, defended, bolt, s, actions, stating, we, have, to, see, it, in, the, glory, of, their, moment, and, give, it, to, them, we, have, to, allow, the, personality, of, youth, to, express, itself, bolt, then, focused, on, attaining, a, gold, medal, in, the, 200, m, event, aiming, to, emulate, carl, lewis, double, win, in, the, 1984, los, angeles, olympics, michael, johnson, felt, that, bolt, would, easily, win, gold, but, believed, that, his, own, world, record, of, 19, 32, s, set, at, the, 1996, summer, olympics, in, atlanta, would, remain, intact, at, the, olympics, bolt, eased, through, the, first, and, second, rounds, of, the, 200, m, jogging, towards, the, end, of, his, run, both, times, he, won, his, semi, final, and, progressed, to, the, final, as, the, favourite, to, win, retired, jamaican, sprinter, don, quarrie, praised, bolt, saying, he, was, confident, that, johnson, s, record, could, be, beaten, the, following, day, at, the, final, he, won, jamaica, s, fourth, gold, of, the, games, setting, a, new, world, and, olympic, record, of, 19, 30, s, johnson, s, record, fell, despite, the, fact, that, bolt, was, impeded, by, a, 0, 9, m, s, 3, 2, km, h, 2, 0, mph, headwind, the, feat, made, him, the, first, sprinter, since, quarrie, to, hold, both, 100, m, and, 200, m, world, records, simultaneously, and, the, first, to, hold, both, records, since, the, introduction, of, electronic, timing, furthermore, bolt, became, the, first, sprinter, to, break, both, records, at, the, same, olympics, unlike, in, the, 100, m, final, bolt, sprinted, hard, all, the, way, to, the, finishing, line, in, the, 200, m, race, even, dipping, his, chest, to, improve, his, time, following, the, race, happy, birthday, was, played, over, the, stadium, s, sound, system, as, his, 22nd, birthday, would, begin, at, midnight, two, days, later, bolt, ran, as, the, third, leg, in, the, jamaican, 4, 100, metres, relay, team, increasing, his, gold, medal, total, to, three, along, with, teammates, nesta, carter, michael, frater, and, asafa, powell, bolt, broke, another, world, and, olympic, record, their, 37, 10, s, finish, breaking, the, previous, record, by, three, tenths, of, a, second, powell, who, anchored, the, team, to, the, finishing, line, lamented, the, loss, of, his, 100, m, record, to, bolt, but, showed, no, animosity, towards, his, jamaican, rival, stating, that, he, was, delighted, to, help, him, set, his, third, world, record, in, january, 2017, the, jamaican, relay, teammates, were, stripped, of, their, gold, medals, when, a, blood, sample, taken, from, carter, after, the, race, was, retested, and, found, positive, for, a, banned, substance, following, his, victories, bolt, donated, us, 50, 000, to, the, children, of, sichuan, province, in, china, to, help, those, harmed, by, the, 2008, sichuan, earthquake, bolt, s, record, setting, runs, caused, commentators, not, only, to, praise, his, achievements, but, to, speculate, about, his, potential, to, become, one, of, the, most, successful, sprinters, in, history, critics, hailed, his, olympic, success, as, a, new, beginning, for, a, sport, that, had, long, suffered, through, high, profile, drug, scandals, the, previous, six, years, had, seen, the, balco, scandal, tim, montgomery, and, justin, gatlin, stripped, of, their, 100, m, world, records, and, marion, jones, returning, three, olympic, gold, medals, all, three, sprinters, were, disqualified, from, athletics, after, drugs, tests, detected, banned, substances, in, their, systems, bolt, s, record, breaking, performances, caused, suspicion, among, some, commentators, including, victor, conte, and, the, lack, of, an, independent, caribbean, anti, doping, federation, raised, more, concerns, the, accusations, of, drug, use, were, vehemently, rejected, by, glen, mills, bolt, s, coach, and, herb, elliott, the, jamaican, athletics, team, doctor, elliott, a, member, of, the, iaaf, anti, doping, commission, urged, those, concerned, about, the, issue, to, come, down, and, see, our, programme, come, down, and, see, our, testing, we, have, nothing, to, hide, mills, had, been, equally, ardent, that, bolt, was, a, clean, athlete, declaring, to, the, jamaica, gleaner, we, will, test, any, time, any, day, any, part, of, the, body, doesn, t, even, like, to, take, vitamins, bolt, stated, that, he, had, been, tested, four, times, prior, to, the, olympics, and, all, had, tested, negative, for, banned, substances, he, also, welcomed, anti, doping, authorities, to, test, him, to, prove, that, he, was, clean, stating, we, work, hard, and, we, perform, well, and, we, know, we, re, clean, i, was, slowing, down, long, before, the, finish, and, wasn, t, tired, at, all, i, could, have, gone, back, to, the, start, and, done, it, all, over, again, at, the, end, of, the, 2008, athletics, season, bolt, competed, in, the, f, golden, league, beginning, in, weltklasse, z, rich, despite, having, the, slowest, start, among, his, competitors, in, the, 100, m, race, he, still, crossed, the, finishing, line, in, 9, 83, s, even, though, the, time, was, slower, than, both, his, newly, set, world, record, and, asafa, powell, s, track, record, it, was, still, among, the, top, fifteen, 100, m, finishes, by, any, sprinter, to, that, date, bolt, admitted, that, he, was, not, running, at, full, strength, because, he, was, suffering, from, a, cold, but, he, concentrated, on, winning, the, race, and, finishing, the, season, in, good, health, at, the, super, grand, prix, final, in, lausanne, bolt, ran, his, second, fastest, 200, m, with, a, time, of, 19, 63, s, equalling, xavier, carter, s, track, record, however, it, was, the, 100, m, final, featuring, asafa, powell, that, drew, the, most, interest, powell, had, moved, closer, to, bolt, s, world, record, after, setting, a, new, personal, best, of, 9, 72, s, reaffirming, his, status, as, bolt, s, main, contender, bolt, s, final, event, of, the, season, came, three, days, later, at, the, golden, league, final, in, brussels, this, was, the, first, 100, m, race, featuring, both, bolt, and, powell, since, the, final, in, the, olympics, both, jamaicans, broke, the, track, record, but, bolt, came, out, on, top, with, a, time, of, 9, 77, s, beating, powell, by, 0, 06, s, victory, however, did, not, come, as, smoothly, as, it, had, in, beijing, bolt, made, the, slowest, start, of, the, nine, competitors, and, had, to, recover, ground, in, cold, conditions, and, against, a, 0, 9, m, s, 3, 2, km, h, 2, 0, mph, headwind, yet, the, results, confirmed, jamaican, dominance, in, the, 100, m, with, nine, of, the, ten, fastest, legal, times, in, history, being, recorded, by, either, bolt, or, powell, on, his, return, to, jamaica, bolt, was, honoured, in, a, homecoming, celebration, and, received, an, order, of, distinction, in, recognition, of, his, achievements, at, the, olympics, additionally, bolt, was, selected, as, the, iaaf, male, athlete, of, the, year, won, a, special, olympic, award, for, his, performances, and, was, named, laureus, world, sportsman, of, the, year, bolt, turned, his, attention, to, future, events, suggesting, that, he, could, aim, to, break, the, 400, metres, world, record, in, 2010, as, no, major, championships, were, scheduled, that, year, bolt, started, the, season, competing, in, the, 400, metres, in, order, to, improve, his, speed, winning, two, races, and, registering, 45, 54, s, in, kingston, and, windy, conditions, gave, him, his, first, sub, 10, seconds, finish, of, the, season, in, the, 100, m, in, march, in, late, april, bolt, suffered, minor, leg, injuries, in, a, car, crash, however, he, quickly, recovered, following, minor, surgery, and, after, cancelling, a, track, meet, in, jamaica, he, stated, that, he, was, fit, to, compete, in, the, 150, metres, street, race, at, the, manchester, great, city, games, bolt, won, the, race, in, 14, 35, s, the, fastest, time, ever, recorded, for, 150, m, despite, not, being, at, full, fitness, he, took, the, 100, and, 200, m, titles, at, the, jamaican, national, championships, with, runs, of, 9, 86, s, and, 20, 25, s, respectively, this, meant, he, had, qualified, for, both, events, at, the, 2009, world, championships, rival, tyson, gay, suggested, that, bolt, s, 100, m, record, was, within, his, grasp, but, bolt, dismissed, the, claim, and, instead, noted, that, he, was, more, interested, in, asafa, powell, s, return, from, injury, bolt, defied, unfavourable, conditions, at, the, athletissima, meet, in, july, running, 19, 59, seconds, into, a, 0, 9, m, s, 3, 2, km, h, 2, 0, mph, headwind, and, rain, to, record, the, fourth, fastest, time, ever, over, 200, m, one, hundredth, off, gay, s, best, time, the, 2009, world, championships, were, held, during, august, at, the, olympic, stadium, in, berlin, which, was, coincidentally, the, same, month, and, venue, where, jesse, owens, had, achieved, world, wide, fame, 73, years, earlier, bolt, eased, through, the, 100, m, heats, clocking, the, fastest, ever, pre, final, performance, of, 9, 89, seconds, the, final, was, the, first, time, that, bolt, and, gay, had, met, during, the, season, and, bolt, set, a, new, world, record, which, stands, to, this, day, with, a, time, of, 9, 58s, to, win, his, first, world, championship, gold, medal, bolt, took, more, than, a, tenth, of, a, second, off, his, previous, best, mark, and, this, was, the, largest, ever, margin, of, improvement, in, the, 100, m, world, record, since, the, beginning, of, electronic, timing, gay, finished, with, a, time, of, 9, 71, s, 0, 02, s, off, bolt, s, 9, 69, s, world, record, run, in, beijing, although, gay, withdrew, from, the, second, race, of, the, competition, bolt, once, again, produced, world, record, breaking, time, in, the, 200, metres, final, he, broke, his, own, record, by, 0, 11, seconds, finishing, with, a, time, of, 19, 19, seconds, he, won, the, 200, m, race, by, the, largest, margin, in, world, championships, history, even, though, the, race, had, three, other, athletes, running, under, 19, 90, seconds, the, greatest, number, ever, in, the, event, bolt, s, pace, impressed, even, the, more, experienced, of, his, competitors, third, placed, wallace, spearmon, complimented, his, speed, and, the, olympic, champion, in, athens, 2004, shawn, crawford, said, just, coming, out, there, i, felt, like, i, was, in, a, video, game, that, guy, was, moving, fast, bolt, pointed, out, that, an, important, factor, in, his, performance, at, the, world, championships, was, his, improved, start, to, the, races, his, reaction, times, in, the, 100, m, 0, 146, and, 200, m, 0, 133, were, significantly, faster, than, those, he, had, produced, in, his, world, record, runs, at, the, beijing, olympics, however, he, together, with, other, members, of, jamaican, 4, 100, m, relay, team, fell, short, of, their, own, world, record, of, 37, 10, s, set, at, 2008, summer, olympics, by, timing, 37, 31, s, which, is, however, a, championship, record, and, the, second, fastest, time, in, history, at, that, date, on, the, last, day, of, the, berlin, championships, the, governing, mayor, of, berlin, klaus, wowereit, presented, bolt, with, a, 12, foot, high, section, of, the, berlin, wall, in, a, small, ceremony, saying, bolt, had, shown, that, one, can, tear, down, walls, that, had, been, considered, as, insurmountable, the, nearly, three, ton, segment, was, delivered, to, the, jamaica, military, museum, in, kingston, several, days, after, bolt, broke, the, world, records, in, 100, and, 200, metres, events, mike, powell, the, world, record, holder, in, long, jump, 8, 95, metres, set, in, 1991, argued, that, bolt, could, become, the, first, man, to, jump, over, 9, metres, the, long, jump, event, being, a, perfect, fit, for, his, speed, and, height, at, the, end, of, the, season, he, was, selected, as, the, iaaf, world, athlete, of, the, year, for, the, second, year, running, early, on, in, the, 2010, outdoor, season, bolt, ran, 19, 56, seconds, in, the, 200, m, in, kingston, jamaica, for, the, fourth, fastest, run, of, all, time, although, he, stated, that, he, had, no, record, breaking, ambitions, for, the, forthcoming, season, he, took, to, the, international, circuit, may, with, wins, in, east, asia, at, the, colorful, daegu, pre, championships, meeting, and, then, a, comfortable, win, in, his, 2010, iaaf, diamond, league, debut, at, the, shanghai, golden, grand, prix, bolt, made, an, attempt, to, break, michael, johnson, s, best, time, over, the, rarely, competed, 300, metres, event, at, the, golden, spike, meeting, in, ostrava, he, failed, to, match, johnson, s, ten, year, old, record, of, 30, 85, and, suffered, a, setback, in, that, his, 30, 97, second, run, in, wet, weather, had, left, him, with, an, achilles, tendon, problem, after, his, return, from, injury, a, month, later, bolt, asserted, himself, with, a, 100, m, win, at, the, athletissima, meeting, in, lausanne, 9, 82, seconds, and, a, victory, over, asafa, powell, at, meeting, areva, in, paris, 9, 84, seconds, despite, this, run, of, form, he, suffered, only, the, second, loss, of, his, career, in, a, 100, m, final, at, the, dn, galan, tyson, gay, soundly, defeated, him, with, a, run, of, 9, 84, to, bolt, s, 9, 97, seconds, and, the, jamaican, reflected, that, he, had, slacked, off, in, training, early, in, the, season, while, gay, had, been, better, prepared, and, in, a, better, condition, this, marked, bolt, s, first, loss, to, gay, in, the, 100, m, which, coincidentally, occurred, in, the, same, stadium, where, powell, had, beaten, bolt, for, the, first, time, two, years, earlier, bolt, went, undefeated, over, 100, m, and, 200, m, in, the, 2011, season, he, began, with, wins, in, rome, and, ostrava, in, may, he, ran, his, first, 200, m, in, over, a, year, in, oslo, that, june, and, his, time, of, 19, 86, seconds, was, a, world, leading, one, two, further, 200, m, wins, came, in, paris, and, stockholm, the, following, month, as, did, a, 100, m, in, monaco, though, he, was, a, tenth, of, a, second, slower, than, compatriot, asafa, powell, before, the, world, championships, considered, the, favourite, to, win, in, the, 100, metres, at, the, 2011, world, championships, in, daegu, bolt, was, eliminated, from, the, final, breaking, ridiculously, early, according, to, the, starter, in, an, interview, for, bbc, sport, and, receiving, a, false, start, this, proved, to, be, the, highest, profile, disqualification, for, a, false, start, since, the, iaaf, changed, the, rules, that, previously, allowed, one, false, start, per, race, the, disqualification, caused, some, to, question, the, new, rule, with, former, world, champion, kim, collins, saying, it, was, a, sad, night, for, athletics, usain, bolt, s, countryman, yohan, blake, won, in, a, comparatively, slow, 9, 92, seconds, in, the, world, championships, 200, m, bolt, cruised, through, to, the, final, which, he, won, in, a, time, of, 19, 40, though, this, was, short, of, his, world, record, times, of, the, two, previous, major, tournaments, it, was, the, fourth, fastest, run, ever, at, that, point, after, his, own, records, and, michael, johnson, s, former, record, and, left, him, three, tenths, of, a, second, ahead, of, runner, up, walter, dix, this, achievement, made, bolt, one, of, only, two, men, to, win, consecutive, 200, m, world, titles, alongside, calvin, smith, bolt, closed, the, championships, with, another, gold, with, jamaica, in, the, 4, 100, metres, relay, nesta, carter, and, michael, frater, joined, world, champions, bolt, and, blake, to, set, a, world, record, time, of, 37, 04, following, the, world, championships, bolt, ran, 9, 85, seconds, for, the, 100, m, to, win, in, zagreb, before, setting, the, year, s, best, time, of, 9, 76, seconds, at, the, memorial, van, damme, this, run, was, overshadowed, by, jamaican, rival, blake, s, unexpected, run, of, 19, 26, seconds, in, the, 200, m, at, the, same, meeting, which, brought, him, within, seven, hundredths, of, bolt, s, world, record, although, bolt, failed, to, win, the, diamond, race, in, a, specific, event, he, was, not, beaten, on, the, 2011, iaaf, diamond, league, circuit, taking, three, wins, in, each, of, his, specialities, that, year, bolt, began, the, 2012, season, with, a, leading, 100, m, time, of, 9, 82, seconds, in, may, he, defeated, asafa, powell, with, runs, of, 9, 76, seconds, in, rome, and, 9, 79, in, oslo, at, the, jamaican, athletics, championships, he, lost, to, yohan, blake, first, in, the, 200, m, and, then, in, the, 100, m, with, his, younger, rival, setting, leading, times, for, the, year, however, at, the, 2012, london, olympics, he, won, the, 100, metres, gold, medal, with, a, time, of, 9, 63, seconds, improving, upon, his, own, olympic, record, and, duplicating, his, gold, medal, from, the, 2008, beijing, olympics, blake, was, the, silver, medallist, with, a, time, of, 9, 75, seconds, following, the, race, seventh, place, finisher, richard, thompson, of, trinidad, and, tobago, declared, there, s, no, doubt, he, s, the, greatest, sprinter, of, all, time, while, usa, today, referred, to, bolt, as, a, jamaican, national, hero, noting, that, his, victory, came, just, hours, before, jamaica, was, to, celebrate, the, 50th, anniversary, of, its, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, with, his, 2012, win, bolt, became, the, first, man, to, successfully, defend, an, olympic, sprint, title, since, carl, lewis, in, 1988, i, m, now, a, legend, i, m, also, the, greatest, athlete, to, live, bolt, followed, this, up, with, a, successful, defence, of, his, olympic, 200, metres, title, with, a, time, of, 19, 32, seconds, followed, by, blake, at, 19, 44, and, warren, weir, at, 19, 84, to, complete, a, jamaican, podium,

farah, who, had, claimed, a, long, distance, track, double, for, the, host, nation, international, olympic, committee, ioc, president, jacques, rogge, initially, stated, that, bolt, was, not, yet, a, legend, and, would, not, deserve, such, acclaim, until, the, end, of, his, career, but, later, called, him, the, best, sprinter, of, all, time, following, the, olympics, he, was, confirmed, as, the,
