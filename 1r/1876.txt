counted, as, win, the, main, weapons, in, graf, s, game, were, her, powerful, inside, out, forehand, drive, which, earned, her, the, moniker, fr, ulein, forehand, and, her, intricate, footwork, she, often, positioned, herself, in, her, backhand, corner, and, although, this, left, her, forehand, wide, open, and, vulnerable, to, attack, her, court, speed, meant, that, only, the, most, accurate, shots, wide, to, her, forehand, caused, any, trouble, graf, s, technique, on, the, forehand, was, unique, and, instantly, recognizable, generating, considerable, racquet, head, speed, with, her, swing, she, reached, the, point, of, contact, late, and, typically, out, of, the, air, as, a, result, she, hit, her, forehand, with, exceptional, pace, and, accuracy, according, to, her, coaches, pavel, slo, il, and, heinz, g, nthardt, graf, s, superior, sense, of, timing, was, the, key, behind, the, success, of, her, forehand, graf, also, had, a, powerful, backhand, drive, but, over, the, course, of, her, career, tended, to, use, it, less, frequently, opting, more, often, for, an, effective, backhand, slice, starting, in, the, early, 1990s, she, used, the, slice, almost, exclusively, in, baseline, rallies, and, mostly, limited, the, topspin, backhand, to, passing, shots, her, accuracy, with, the, slice, both, cross, court, and, down, the, line, and, her, ability, to, skid, the, ball, and, keep, it, low, enabled, her, to, use, it, as, an, offensive, weapon, to, set, the, ball, up, for, her, forehand, put, aways, however, graf, admitted, in, 1995, that, she, would, have, preferred, having, a, two, handed, backhand, in, retrospect, she, built, her, powerful, and, accurate, serve, up, to, 183, km, h, 114, mph, making, it, one, of, the, fastest, serves, in, women, s,
