1966, but, the, project, failed, to, gain, a, backer, although, composed, in, 1965, the, likes, of, us, was, not, publicly, performed, until, 2005, when, a, production, was, staged, at, lloyd, webber,

1950s, it, opens, with, a, traditional, overture, comprising, a, medley, of, tunes, from, the, show, and, the, score, reflects, some, of, lloyd, webber, s, early, influences, particularly, richard, rodgers, frederick, loewe, and, lionel, bart, in, this, respect, it, is, markedly, different, from, the, composer, s, later, work, which, tends, to, be, either, predominantly, or, wholly, through, composed, and, closer, in, form, to, opera, in, the, summer, of, 1967, alan, doggett, a, family, friend, of, the, lloyd, webbers, who, had, assisted, on, the, likes, of, us, and, who, was, the, music,

p, g, wodehouse, tim, rice, was, uncertain, about, this, venture, partly, because, of, his, concern, that, he, might, not, be, able, to, do, justice, to, the, novels, that, he, and, lloyd, webber, so, admired, rice, backed, out, of, the, project, and, lloyd, webber, subsequently, wrote, the, musical, jeeves, with, alan, ayckbourn, who, provided, the, book, and, lyrics, jeeves, failed, to, make,
