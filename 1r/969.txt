returned, to, london, and, joined, a, religious, society, led, by, moravian, christians, on, 24, may, 1738, he, experienced, what, has, come, to, be, called, his, evangelical, conversion, he, subsequently, left, the, moravians, and, began, his, own, ministry, a, key, step, in, the, development, of, wesley, s, ministry, was, to, travel, widely, and, preach, outdoors, embracing, arminian, doctrines, moving, across, great, britain, and, ireland, he, helped, form, and, organise, small, christian, groups, societies, and, classes, that, developed, intensive, and, personal, accountability,

became, leaders, in, many, social, issues, of, the, day, including, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, support, for, women, preachers, although, he, was, not, a, systematic, theologian, wesley, argued, against, calvinism, and, for, the, notion, of, christian, perfection, which, he, cited, as, the, reason, that, he, felt, god, raised, up, methodists, into, existence, his, evangelicalism, firmly, grounded, in, sacramental, theology, maintained, that, means, of, grace, played, a, role, in, sanctification, of, the, believer, however, he, taught, that, it, was, by, faith, a, believer, was, transformed, into, the, likeness, of, christ, he, held, that, in, this, life, christians, could, achieve, a, state, where, the, love, of, god, reigned, supreme, in, their, hearts, giving, them, not, only, outward, but, inward, holiness, wesley, s, teachings, collectively, known, as, wesleyan, theology, continue, to, inform, the, doctrine, of, methodist, churches, throughout, his, life, wesley, remained, within, the, established, church, of, england, insisting, that, the, methodist, movement, lay, well, within, its, tradition, in, his, early, ministry, years, wesley, was, barred, from, preaching, in, many, parish, churches, and, the, methodists, were, persecuted, he, later, became, widely, respected, and, by, the, end, of, his, life, was, described, as, the, best, loved, man, in,

soon, as, they, turned, five, years, old, they, were, expected, to, become, proficient, in, latin, and, greek, and, to, have, learned, major, portions, of, the, new, testament, by, heart, susanna, wesley, examined, each, child, before, the, midday, meal, and, before, evening, prayers, the, children, were, not, allowed, to, eat, between, meals, and, were, interviewed, singly, by, their, mother,

john, king, from, 1715, where, he, lived, the, studious, methodical, and, for, a, while, religious, life, in, which, he, had, been, trained, at, home, apart, from, his, disciplined, upbringing, a, rectory, fire, which, occurred, on, 9, february, 1709, when, wesley, was, five, years, old, left, an, indelible, impression, some, time, after, 11, 00, pm, the, rectory, roof, caught, on, fire, sparks, falling, on, the, children, s, beds, and, cries, of, fire, from, the, street, roused, the, wesleys, who, managed, to, shepherd, all, their, children, out, of, the, house, except, for, john, who, was, left, stranded, on, an, upper, floor, with, stairs, aflame, and, the, roof, about, to, collapse, wesley, was, lifted, out, of, a, window, by, a, parishioner, standing, on, another, man, s, shoulders, wesley, later, used, the, phrase, a, brand, plucked, out, of, the, fire, quoting, zechariah, 3, 2, to, describe, the, incident, this, childhood, deliverance, subsequently, became, part, of, the, wesley, legend, attesting, to, his, special, destiny, and, extraordinary, work, wesley, was, also, influenced, by, the, reported, haunting, of, epworth, rectory, between, 1716, and, 1717, the, wesley, family, reported, frequently, hearing, noises, and, occasionally, seeing, apparitions, which, they, believed, were, caused, by, a, ghost, called, old, jeffery, in, june, 1720, wesley, entered, christ, church, oxford, after, graduating, in, 1724, wesley, stayed, on, at, christ, church, to, study, for, his, master, s, degree, he, was, ordained, a, deacon, on, 25, september, 1725, holy, orders, being, a, necessary, step, toward, becoming, a, fellow, and, tutor, at, the, university, on, 17, march, 1726, wesley, was, unanimously, elected, a, fellow, of, lincoln, college, oxford, this, carried, with, it, the, right, to, a, room, at, the, college, and, regular, salary, while, continuing, his, studies, he, taught, greek, and, philosophy, lectured, on, the, new, testament, and, moderated, daily, disputations, at, the, university, however, a, call, to, ministry, intruded, upon, his, academic, career, in, august, 1727, after, completing, his, master, s, degree, wesley, returned, to, epworth, his, father, had, requested, his, assistance, in, serving, the, neighbouring, cure, of, wroot, ordained, a, priest, on, 22, september, 1728, wesley, served, as, a, parish, curate, for, two, years, in, the, year, of, his, ordination, he, read, thomas, kempis, and, jeremy, taylor, showed, his, interest, in, mysticism, and, began, to, seek, the, religious, truths, which, underlay, the, great, revival, of, the, 18th, century, the, reading, of, william, law, s, christian, perfection, and, a, serious, call, to, a, devout, and, holy, life, gave, him, he, said, a, more, sublime, view, of, the, law, of, god, and, he, resolved, to, keep, it, inwardly, and, outwardly, as, sacredly, as, possible, believing, that, in, obedience, he, would, find, salvation, he, pursued, a, rigidly, methodical, and, abstemious, life, studied, scripture, and, performed, his, religious, duties, diligently, depriving, himself, so, that, he, would, have, alms, to, give, he, began, to, seek, after, holiness, of, heart, and, life, wesley, returned, to, oxford, in, november, 1729, at, the, request, of, the, rector, of, lincoln, college, and, to, maintain, his, status, as, a, junior, fellow, during, wesley, s, absence, his, younger, brother, charles, 1707, 88, matriculated, at, christ, church, along, with, two, fellow, students, he, formed, a, small, club, for, the, purpose, of, study, and, the, pursuit, of, a, devout, christian, life, on, wesley, s, return, he, became, the, leader, of, the, group, which, increased, somewhat, in, number, and, greatly, in, commitment, the, group, met, daily, from, six, until, nine, for, prayer, psalms, and, reading, of, the, greek, new, testament, they, prayed, every, waking, hour, for, several, minutes, and, each, day, for, a, special, virtue, while, the, church, s, prescribed, attendance, was, only, three, times, a, year, they, took, communion, every, sunday, they, fasted, on, wednesdays, and, fridays, until, nones, 3, 00, pm, as, was, commonly, observed, in, the, ancient, church, in, 1730, the, group, began, the, practice, of, visiting, prisoners, in, gaol, they, preached, educated, and, relieved, gaoled, debtors, whenever, possible, and, cared, for, the, sick, given, the, low, ebb, of, spirituality, in, oxford, at, that, time, it, was, not, surprising, that, wesley, s, group, provoked, a, negative, reaction, they, were, considered, to, be, religious, enthusiasts, which, in, the, context, of, the, time, meant, religious, fanatics, university, wits, styled, them, the, holy, club, a, title, of, derision, currents, of, opposition, became, a, furore, following, the, mental, breakdown, and, death, of, a, group, member, william, morgan, in, response, to, the, charge, that, rigorous, fasting, had, hastened, his, death, wesley, noted, that, morgan, had, left, off, fasting, a, year, and, a, half, since, in, the, same, letter, which, was, widely, circulated, wesley, referred, to, the, name, methodist, with, which, some, of, our, neighbors, are, pleased, to, compliment, us, that, name, was, used, by, an, anonymous, author, in, a, published, pamphlet, 1732, describing, wesley, and, his, group, the, oxford, methodists, this, ministry, however, was, not, without, controversy, the, holy, club, ministered, and, maintained, support, for, thomas, blair, who, in, 1732, was, found, guilty, of, sodomy, blair, was, notorious, among, the, townspeople, and, his, fellow, prisoners, and, wesley, continued, to, support, him, for, all, of, his, outward, piety, wesley, sought, to, cultivate, his, inner, holiness, or, at, least, his, sincerity, as, evidence, of, being, a, true, christian, a, list, of, general, questions, which, he, developed, in, 1730, evolved, into, an, elaborate, grid, by, 1734, in, which, he, recorded, his, daily, activities, hour, by, hour, resolutions, he, had, broken, or, kept, and, ranked, his, hourly, temper, of, devotion, on, a, scale, of, 1, to, 9, wesley, also, regarded, the, contempt, with, which, he, and, his, group, were, held, to, be, a, mark, of, a, true, christian, as, he, put, it, in, a, letter, to, his, father, till, he, be, thus, contemned, no, man, is, in, a, state, of, salvation, on, 14, october, 1735, wesley, and, his, brother, charles, sailed, on, the, simmonds, from, gravesend, in, kent, for, savannah, in, the, province, of, georgia, in, the, american, colonies, at, the, request, of, james, oglethorpe, who, had, founded, the, colony, in, 1733, on, behalf, of, the, trustees, for, the, establishment, of, the, colony, of, georgia, in, america, oglethorpe, wanted, wesley, to, be, the, minister, of, the, newly, formed, savannah, parish, a, new, town, laid, out, in, accordance, with, the, famous, oglethorpe, plan, it, was, on, the, voyage, to, the, colonies, that, the, wesleys, first, came, into, contact, with, moravian, settlers, wesley, was, influenced, by, their, deep, faith, and, spirituality, rooted, in, pietism, at, one, point, in, the, voyage, a, storm, came, up, and, broke, the, mast, off, the, ship, while, the, english, panicked, the, moravians, calmly, sang, hymns, and, prayed, this, experience, led, wesley, to, believe, that, the, moravians, possessed, an, inner, strength, which, he, lacked, the, deeply, personal, religion, that, the, moravian, pietists, practised, heavily, influenced, wesley, and, is, reflected, in, his, theology, of, methodism, wesley, arrived, in, the, colony, in, february, 1736, and, lived, for, a, year, at, the, parsonage, that, stood, on, the, site, of, today, s, oliver, sturges, house, he, approached, the, georgia, mission, as, a, high, churchman, seeing, it, as, an, opportunity, to, revive, primitive, christianity, in, a, primitive, environment, although, his, primary, goal, was, to, evangelize, the, native, american, people, a, shortage, of, clergy, in, the, colony, largely, limited, his, ministry, to, european, settlers, in, savannah, while, his, ministry, has, often, been, judged, to, have, been, a, failure, in, comparison, to, his, later, success, as, a, leader, in, the, evangelical, revival, wesley, gathered, around, him, a, group, of, devoted, christians, who, met, in, a, number, of, small, group, religious, societies, at, the, same, time, attendance, at, communion, increased, over, the, course, of, nearly, two, years, in, which, he, served, as, christ, church, s, parish, priest, nonetheless, wesley, s, high, church, ministry, was, controversial, among, the, colonists, and, it, ended, in, disappointment, after, wesley, fell, in, love, with, a, young, woman, named, sophia, or, sophy, hopkey, he, hesitated, to, marry, her, because, he, felt, that, his, first, priority, in, georgia, was, to, be, a, missionary, to, the, native, americans, and, he, was, interested, in, the, practice, of, clerical, celibacy, within, early, christianity, following, her, marriage, to, william, williamson, wesley, believed, sophia, s, former, zeal, for, practising, the, christian, faith, declined, in, strictly, applying, the, rubrics, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, wesley, denied, her, communion, after, she, failed, to, signify, to, him, in, advance, her, intention, of, taking, it, as, a, result, legal, proceedings, against, him, ensued, in, which, a, clear, resolution, seemed, unlikely, on, 22, december, 1737, wesley, fled, the, colony, and, returned, to, england, it, has, been, widely, recognised, that, one, of, the, most, significant, accomplishments, of, wesley, s, georgia, mission, was, his, publication, of, a, collection, of, psalms, and, hymns, the, collection, was, the, first, anglican, hymnal, published, in, america, and, the, first, of, many, hymn, books, wesley, published, it, included, five, hymns, he, translated, from, german, as, a, result, of, his, experience, in, georgia, wesley, became, depressed, while, on, his, voyage, home, to, england, he, had, the, opportunity, to, think, about, his, own, religious, faith, he, found, that, although, he, had, committed, to, the, life, of, following, christ, he, was, dissatisfied, with, his, spiritual, soundness, and, felt, inadequate, to, preach, especially, after, witnessing, the, confident, way, in, which, the, moravians, had, preached, their, faith, both, he, and, charles, received, counsel, from, moravian, minister, peter, boehler, who, was, temporarily, in, england, awaiting, permission, to, depart, for, georgia, himself, boehler, encouraged, wesley, to, preach, faith, until, you, have, it, wesley, s, noted, aldersgate, experience, of, 24, may, 1738, at, a, moravian, meeting, in, aldersgate, street, london, in, which, he, heard, a, reading, of, martin, luther, s, preface, to, the, epistle, to, the, romans, revolutionised, the, character, and, method, of, his, ministry, the, previous, week, he, had, been, highly, impressed, by, the, sermon, of, john, heylyn, whom, he, was, assisting, in, the, service, at, st, mary, le, strand, earlier, that, day, he, had, heard, the, choir, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, singing, psalm, 130, where, the, psalmist, calls, to, god, out, of, the, depths, but, it, was, still, a, depressed, wesley, who, attended, a, service, on, the, evening, of, 24, may, wesley, recounted, his, aldersgate, experience, in, his, journal, in, the, evening, i, went, very, unwillingly, to, a, society, in, aldersgate, street, where, one, was, reading, luther, s, preface, to, the, epistle, to, the, romans, about, a, quarter, before, nine, while, he, was, describing, the, change, which, god, works, in, the, heart, through, faith, in, christ, i, felt, my, heart, strangely, warmed, i, felt, i, did, trust, in, christ, christ, alone, for, salvation, and, an, assurance, was, given, me, that, he, had, taken, away, my, sins, even, mine, and, saved, me, from, the, law, of, sin, and, death, a, few, weeks, later, wesley, preached, a, sermon, on, the, doctrine, of, personal, salvation, by, faith, which, was, followed, by, another, on, god, s, grace, free, in, all, and, free, for, all, considered, a, pivotal, moment, daniel, l, burnett, writes, the, significance, of, wesley, s, aldersgate, experience, is, monumental, without, it, the, names, of, wesley, and, methodism, would, likely, be, nothing, more, than, obscure, footnotes, in, the, pages, of, church, history, burnett, describes, this, event, as, wesley, s, evangelical, conversion, may, 24, is, commemorated, in, methodist, churches, as, aldersgate, day, wesley, allied, himself, with, the, moravian, society, in, fetter, lane, in, august, 1738, wesley, travelled, to, germany, specifically, to, see, herrnhut, in, saxony, as, he, wished, to, study, at, the, moravian, headquarters, there, on, his, return, to, england, wesley, drew, up, rules, for, the, bands, into, which, the, fetter, lane, society, was, divided, and, published, a, collection, of, hymns, for, them, he, met, frequently, with, this, and, other, religious, societies, in, london, but, did, not, preach, often, in, 1738, because, most, of, the, parish, churches, were, closed, to, him, wesley, s, oxford, friend, the, evangelist, george, whitefield, was, also, excluded, from, the, churches, of, bristol, upon, his, return, from, america, when, wesley, reached, bristol, the, city, was, booming, with, new, industrial, and, commercial, development, because, of, this, there, were, social, uproars, with, riots, and, religious, troubles, about, a, fifth, of, the, population, were, dissenters, while, many, of, the, anglicans, possessed, a, religious, enthusiasm, that, made, them, receptive, to, wesley, s, message, and, approach, going, to, the, neighbouring, village, of, kingswood, in, february, 1739, whitefield, preached, in, the, open, air, to, a, company, of, miners, later, he, preached, in, whitefield, s, tabernacle, wesley, hesitated, to, accept, whitefield, s, call, to, copy, this, bold, step, overcoming, his, scruples, he, preached, the, first, time, at, whitefield, s, invitation, a, sermon, in, the, open, air, at, a, brickyard, near, st, philip, s, marsh, on, 2, april, 1739, wesley, wrote, i, could, scarce, reconcile, myself, to, this, strange, way, of, preaching, in, the, fields, of, which, he, set, me, an, example, on, sunday, having, been, all, my, life, till, very, lately, so, tenacious, of, every, point, relating, to, decency, and, order, that, i, should, have, thought, the, saving, of, souls, almost, a, sin, if, it, had, not, been, done, in, a, church, wesley, was, unhappy, about, the, idea, of, field, preaching, as, he, believed, anglican, liturgy, had, much, to, offer, in, its, practice, earlier, in, his, life, he, would, have, thought, that, such, a, method, of, saving, souls, was, almost, a, sin, he, recognised, the, open, air, services, were, successful, in, reaching, men, and, women, who, would, not, enter, most, churches, from, then, on, he, took, the, opportunities, to, preach, wherever, an, assembly, could, be, brought, together, more, than, once, using, his, father, s, tombstone, at, epworth, as, a, pulpit, wesley, preached, to, create, repentance, prayed, for, conversion, dealt, with, hysterical, behaviour, and, preached, to, upwards, of, thousands, through, field, preaching, wesley, continued, for, fifty, years, entering, churches, when, he, was, invited, and, taking, his, stand, in, the, fields, in, halls, cottages, and, chapels, when, the, churches, would, not, receive, him, late, in, 1739, wesley, broke, with, the, moravians, in, london, wesley, had, helped, them, organise, the, fetter, lane, society, and, those, converted, by, his, preaching, and, that, of, his, brother, and, whitefield, had, become, members, of, their, bands, but, he, believed, they, fell, into, heresy, by, supporting, quietism, so, he, decided, to, form, his, own, followers, into, a, separate, society, thus, he, wrote, without, any, previous, plan, began, the, methodist, society, in, england, he, soon, formed, similar, societies, in, bristol, and, kingswood, and, wesley, and, his, friends, made, converts, wherever, they, went, from, 1739, onward, wesley, and, the, methodists, were, persecuted, by, clergy, and, religious, magistrates, for, various, reasons, though, wesley, had, been, ordained, an, anglican, priest, many, other, methodist, leaders, had, not, received, ordination, and, for, his, own, part, wesley, flouted, many, regulations, of, the, church, of, england, concerning, parish, boundaries, and, who, had, the, authority, to, preach, this, was, seen, as, a, social, threat, that, disregarded, institutions, clergy, attacked, them, in, sermons, and, in, print, and, at, times, mobs, attacked, them, wesley, and, his, followers, continued, to, work, among, the, neglected, and, needy, they, were, denounced, as, promulgators, of, strange, doctrines, fomenters, of, religious, disturbances, as, blind, fanatics, leading, people, astray, claiming, miraculous, gifts, attacking, the, clergy, of, the, church, of, england, and, trying, to, re, establish, catholicism, wesley, felt, that, the, church, failed, to, call, sinners, to, repentance, that, many, of, the, clergy, were, corrupt, and, that, people, were, perishing, in, their, sins, he, believed, he, was, commissioned, by, god, to, bring, about, revival, in, the, church, and, no, opposition, persecution, or, obstacles, could, prevail, against, the, divine, urgency, and, authority, of, this, commission, the, prejudices, of, his, high, church, training, his, strict, notions, of, the, methods, and, proprieties, of, public, worship, his, views, of, the, apostolic, succession, and, the, prerogatives, of, the, priest, even, his, most, cherished, convictions, were, not, allowed, to, stand, in, the, way, seeing, that, he, and, the, few, clergy, cooperating, with, him, could, not, do, the, work, that, needed, to, be, done, wesley, was, led, as, early, as, 1739, to, approve, local, preachers, he, evaluated, and, approved, men, who, were, not, ordained, by, the, anglican, church, to, preach, and, do, pastoral, work, this, expansion, of, lay, preachers, was, one, of, the, keys, to, the, growth, of, methodism, as, his, societies, needed, houses, to, worship, in, wesley, began, to, provide, chapels, first, in, bristol, at, the, new, room, then, in, london, first, the, foundery, and, then, wesley, s, chapel, and, elsewhere, the, foundery, was, an, early, chapel, used, by, wesley, the, location, of, the, foundery, is, shown, on, an, 18th, century, map, where, it, rests, between, tabernacle, street, and, worship, street, in, the, moorfields, area, of, london, when, the, wesleys, spotted, the, building, atop, windmill, hill, north, of, finsbury, fields, the, structure, which, previously, cast, brass, guns, and, mortars, for, the, royal, ordnance, had, been, sitting, vacant, for, 23, years, it, had, been, abandoned, because, of, an, explosion, on, 10, may, 1716, the, bristol, chapel, built, in, 1739, was, at, first, in, the, hands, of, trustees, a, large, debt, was, contracted, and, wesley, s, friends, urged, him, to, keep, it, under, his, own, control, so, the, deed, was, cancelled, and, he, became, sole, trustee, following, this, precedent, all, methodist, chapels, were, committed, in, trust, to, him, until, by, a, deed, of, declaration, all, his, interests, in, them, were, transferred, to, a, body, of, preachers, called, the, legal, hundred, when, disorder, arose, among, some, members, of, the, societies, wesley, adopted, giving, tickets, to, members, with, their, names, written, by, his, own, hand, these, were, renewed, every, three, months, those, deemed, unworthy, did, not, receive, new, tickets, and, dropped, out, of, the, society, without, disturbance, the, tickets, were, regarded, as, commendatory, letters, when, the, debt, on, a, chapel, became, a, burden, it, was, proposed, that, one, in, 12, members, should, collect, offerings, regularly, from, the, 11, allotted, to, him, out, of, this, grew, the, methodist, class, meeting, system, in, 1742, to, keep, the, disorderly, out, of, the, societies, wesley, established, a, probationary, system, he, undertook, to, visit, each, society, regularly, in, what, became, the, quarterly, visitation, or, conference, as, the, number, of, societies, increased, wesley, could, not, keep, personal, contact, so, in, 1743, he, drew, up, a, set, of, general, rules, for, the, united, societies, these, were, the, nucleus, of, the, methodist, discipline, still, the, basis, of, modern, methodism, wesley, laid, the, foundations, of, what, now, constitutes, the, organisation, of, the, methodist, church, over, time, a, shifting, pattern, of, societies, circuits, quarterly, meetings, annual, conferences, classes, bands, and, select, societies, took, shape, at, the, local, level, there, were, numerous, societies, of, different, sizes, which, were, grouped, into, circuits, to, which, travelling, preachers, were, appointed, for, two, year, periods, circuit, officials, met, quarterly, under, a, senior, travelling, preacher, or, assistant, conferences, with, wesley, travelling, preachers, and, others, were, convened, annually, for, the, purpose, of, co, ordinating, doctrine, and, discipline, for, the, entire, connection, classes, of, a, dozen, or, so, society, members, under, a, leader, met, weekly, for, spiritual, fellowship, and, guidance, in, the, early, years, there, were, bands, of, the, spiritually, gifted, who, consciously, pursued, perfection, those, who, were, regarded, to, have, achieved, it, were, grouped, in, select, societies, or, bands, in, 1744, there, were, 77, such, members, there, also, was, a, category, of, penitents, which, consisted, of, backsliders, as, the, number, of, preachers, and, preaching, houses, increased, doctrinal, and, administrative, matters, needed, to, be, discussed, so, john, and, charles, wesley, along, with, four, other, clergy, and, four, lay, preachers, met, for, consultation, in, london, in, 1744, this, was, the, first, methodist, conference, subsequently, the, conference, with, wesley, as, its, president, became, the, ruling, body, of, the, methodist, movement, two, years, later, to, help, preachers, work, more, systematically, and, societies, receive, services, more, regularly, wesley, appointed, helpers, to, definitive, circuits, each, circuit, included, at, least, 30, appointments, a, month, believing, that, the, preacher, s, efficiency, was, promoted, by, his, being, changed, from, one, circuit, to, another, every, year, or, two, wesley, established, the, itinerancy, and, insisted, that, his, preachers, submit, to, its, rules, john, wesley, had, strong, links, with, the, north, west, of, england, visiting, manchester, on, at, least, fifteen, occasions, between, 1733, and, 1790, in, 1733, and, 1738, he, preached, at, st, ann, s, church, and, salford, chapel, meeting, with, his, friend, john, clayton, in, 1781, wesley, opened, the, chapel, on, oldham, street, part, of, the, manchester, and, salford, wesleyan, methodist, mission, now, the, site, of, manchester, s, methodist, central, hall, wesley, travelled, to, ireland, for, the, first, time, in, 1747, and, continued, through, 1789, he, rejected, the, catholic, church, so, he, worked, to, convert, the, people, of, ireland, to, methodism, overall, the, numbers, grew, to, over, 15, 000, by, 1795, following, an, illness, in, 1748, wesley, was, nursed, by, a, class, leader, and, housekeeper, grace, murray, at, an, orphan, house, in, newcastle, taken, with, grace, he, invited, her, to, travel, with, him, to, ireland, in, 1749, where, he, believed, them, to, be, betrothed, though, they, were, never, married, it, has, been, suggested, that, his, brother, charles, wesley, objected, to, the, engagement, though, this, is, disputed, subsequently, grace, married, john, bennett, a, preacher, as, the, societies, multiplied, they, adopted, the, elements, of, an, ecclesiastical, system, the, divide, between, wesley, and, the, church, of, england, widened, the, question, of, division, from, the, church, of, england, was, urged, by, some, of, his, preachers, and, societies, but, most, strenuously, opposed, by, his, brother, charles, wesley, refused, to, leave, the, church, of, england, believing, that, anglicanism, was, with, all, her, blemishes, nearer, the, scriptural, plans, than, any, other, in, europe, in, 1745, wesley, wrote, that, he, would, make, any, concession, which, his, conscience, permitted, to, live, in, peace, with, the, clergy, he, could, not, give, up, the, doctrine, of, an, inward, and, present, salvation, by, faith, itself, he, would, not, stop, preaching, nor, dissolve, the, societies, nor, end, preaching, by, lay, members, in, the, same, year, in, correspondence, with, a, friend, he, wrote, that, he, believed, it, wrong, to, administer, sacraments, without, having, been, ordained, by, a, bishop, when, in, 1746, wesley, read, lord, king, s, account, of, the, primitive, church, he, became, convinced, that, apostolic, succession, could, be, transmitted, through, not, only, bishops, but, also, presbyters, priests, he, wrote, that, he, was, a, scriptural, episkopos, as, much, as, many, men, in, england, although, he, believed, in, apostolic, succession, he, also, once, called, the, idea, of, uninterrupted, succession, a, fable, edward, stillingfleet, s, irenicon, led, him, to, decide, that, ordination, and, holy, orders, could, be, valid, when, performed, by, a, presbyter, rather, than, a, bishop, nevertheless, some, believe, that, wesley, was, secretly, consecrated, a, bishop, in, 1763, by, erasmus, of, arcadia, and, that, wesley, could, not, openly, announce, his, episcopal, consecration, without, incurring, the, penalty, of, the, pr, munire, act, in, 1784, he, believed, he, could, no, longer, wait, for, the, bishop, of, london, to, ordain, someone, for, the, american, methodists, who, were, without, the, sacraments, after, the, american, war, of, independence, the, church, of, england, had, been, disestablished, in, the, united, states, where, it, had, been, the, state, church, in, most, of, the, southern, colonies, the, church, of, england, had, not, yet, appointed, a, united, states, bishop, to, what, would, become, the, protestant, episcopal, church, in, america, wesley, ordained, thomas, coke, as, superintendent, of, methodists, in, the, united, states, by, the, laying, on, of, hands, although, coke, was, already, a, priest, in, the, church, of, england, he, also, ordained, richard, whatcoat, and, thomas, vasey, as, presbyters, whatcoat, and, vasey, sailed, to, america, with, coke, wesley, intended, that, coke, and, francis, asbury, whom, coke, ordained, as, superintendent, by, direction, of, wesley, should, ordain, others, in, the, newly, founded, methodist, episcopal, church, in, the, united, states, in, 1787, coke, and, asbury, persuaded, the, american, methodists, to, refer, to, them, as, bishops, rather, than, superintendents, overruling, wesley, s, objections, to, the, change, his, brother, charles, was, alarmed, by, the, ordinations, and, wesley, s, evolving, view, of, the, matter, he, begged, wesley, to, stop, before, he, had, quite, broken, down, the, bridge, and, not, embitter, his, last, moments, on, earth, nor, leave, an, indelible, blot, on, our, memory, wesley, replied, that, he, had, not, separated, from, the, church, nor, did, he, intend, to, but, he, must, and, would, save, as, many, souls, as, he, could, while, alive, without, being, careful, about, what, may, possibly, be, when, i, die, although, wesley, rejoiced, that, the, methodists, in, america, were, free, he, advised, his, english, followers, to, remain, in, the, established, church, the, 20th, century, wesleyan, scholar, albert, outler, argued, in, his, introduction, to, the, 1964, collection, john, wesley, that, wesley, developed, his, theology, by, using, a, method, that, outler, termed, the, wesleyan, quadrilateral, in, this, method, wesley, believed, that, the, living, core, of, christianity, was, contained, in, scripture, the, bible, and, that, it, was, the, sole, foundational, source, of, theological, development, the, centrality, of, scripture, was, so, important, for, wesley, that, he, called, himself, a, man, of, one, book, although, he, was, well, read, for, his, day, however, he, believed, that, doctrine, had, to, be, in, keeping, with, christian, orthodox, tradition, so, tradition, was, considered, the, second, aspect, of, the, quadrilateral, wesley, contended, that, a, part, of, the, theological, method, would, involve, experiential, faith, in, other, words, truth, would, be, vivified, in, the, personal, experience, of, christians, overall, not, individually, if, it, were, really, truth, and, every, doctrine, must, be, able, to, be, defended, rationally, he, did, not, divorce, faith, from, reason, tradition, experience, and, reason, however, were, subject, always, to, scripture, wesley, argued, because, only, there, is, the, word, of, god, revealed, so, far, as, it, is, necessary, for, our, salvation, the, doctrines, which, wesley, emphasised, in, his, sermons, and, writings, are, prevenient, grace, present, personal, salvation, by, faith, the, witness, of, the, spirit, and, entire, sanctification, prevenient, grace, was, the, theological, underpinning, of, his, belief, that, all, persons, were, capable, of, being, saved, by, faith, in, christ, unlike, the, calvinists, of, his, day, wesley, did, not, believe, in, predestination, that, is, that, some, persons, had, been, elected, by, god, for, salvation, and, others, for, damnation, he, understood, that, christian, orthodoxy, insisted, that, salvation, was, only, possible, by, the, sovereign, grace, of, god, he, expressed, his, understanding, of, humanity, s, relationship, to, god, as, utter, dependence, upon, god, s, grace, god, was, at, work, to, enable, all, people, to, be, capable, of, coming, to, faith, by, empowering, humans, to, have, actual, existential, freedom, of, response, to, god, wesley, defined, the, witness, of, the, spirit, as, an, inward, impression, on, the, soul, of, believers, whereby, the, spirit, of, god, directly, testifies, to, their, spirit, that, they, are, the, children, of, god, he, inherited, this, doctrine, from, the, protestant, reformers, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, and, saw, its, basis, in, several, passages, of, the, bible, such, as, romans, 8, 16, this, doctrine, was, closely, related, to, his, belief, that, salvation, had, to, be, personal, in, his, view, a, person, must, ultimately, believe, the, good, news, for, himself, or, herself, no, one, could, be, in, relation, to, god, for, another, entire, sanctification, he, described, in, 1790, as, the, grand, depositum, which, god, has, lodged, with, the, people, called, methodists, and, that, the, propagation, of, this, doctrine, was, the, reason, that, he, brought, methodists, into, existence, wesley, taught, that, entire, sanctification, was, obtainable, after, justification, by, faith, between, justification, and, death, wesley, defined, it, as, that, habitual, disposition, of, soul, which, in, the, sacred, writings, is, termed, holiness, and, which, directly, implies, the, being, cleansed, from, sin, from, all, filthiness, both, of, flesh, and, spirit, and, by, consequence, the, being, endued, with, those, virtues, which, were, in, christ, jesus, the, being, so, renewed, in, the, image, of, our, mind, as, to, be, perfect, as, our, father, in, heaven, is, perfect, the, term, sinless, perfection, was, one, which, wesley, avoided, using, because, of, its, ambiguity, rather, he, contended, that, a, christian, could, be, made, perfect, in, love, wesley, studied, eastern, orthodoxy, and, embraced, particularly, the, doctrine, of, theosis, this, love, would, mean, first, of, all, that, a, believer, s, motives, rather, than, being, self, centred, would, be, guided, by, the, deep, desire, to, please, god, one, would, be, able, to, keep, from, committing, what, wesley, called, sin, rightly, so, called, by, this, he, meant, a, conscious, or, intentional, breach, of, god, s, will, or, laws, secondly, to, be, made, perfect, in, love, meant, for, wesley, that, a, christian, could, live, with, a, primary, guiding, regard, for, others, and, their, welfare, he, based, this, on, christ, s, quote, that, the, second, great, command, is, to, love, your, neighbour, as, you, love, yourself, in, wesley, s, view, this, orientation, would, cause, a, person, to, avoid, any, number, of, sins, against, his, neighbour, this, love, plus, the, love, for, god, that, could, be, the, central, focus, of, a, person, s, faith, would, be, what, wesley, referred, to, as, a, fulfilment, of, the, law, of, christ, he, described, perfection, as, a, second, blessing, and, instantaneous, sanctifying, experience, he, maintained, that, individuals, could, have, the, assurance, of, their, entire, sanctification, through, the, testimony, of, the, holy, spirit, wesley, collected, and, published, such, testimonies, wesley, assumed, the, superiority, of, christianity, vis, a, vis, to, islam, based, on, his, commitment, to, the, biblical, revelation, as, the, book, of, god, his, theological, interpretation, of, christianity, was, seeking, its, imperative, rather, than, considering, other, abrahamic, and, eastern, religions, to, be, equal, he, often, regarded, the, lifestyles, of, muslims, as, an, ox, goad, to, prick, the, collective, christian, conscience, wesley, entered, controversies, as, he, tried, to, enlarge, church, practice, the, most, notable, of, his, controversies, was, that, on, calvinism, his, father, was, of, the, arminian, school, in, the, church, wesley, came, to, his, own, conclusions, while, in, college, and, expressed, himself, strongly, against, the, doctrines, of, calvinistic, election, and, reprobation, his, system, of, thought, has, become, known, as, wesleyan, arminianism, the, foundations, of, which, were, laid, by, wesley, and, his, fellow, preacher, john, william, fletcher, although, wesley, knew, very, little, about, the, beliefs, of, jacob, arminius, and, arrived, at, his, religious, views, independently, of, arminius, wesley, acknowledged, late, in, life, with, the, 1778, publication, of, the, arminian, magazine, that, he, and, arminius, were, in, general, agreement, theology, professor, w, stephen, gunther, concludes, he, was, a, faithful, representative, of, arminius, beliefs, wesley, was, perhaps, the, clearest, english, proponent, of, arminianism, by, contrast, whitefield, inclined, to, calvinism, in, his, first, tour, in, america, he, embraced, the, views, of, the, new, england, school, of, calvinism, whitefield, opposed, wesley, s, advocacy, of, arminianism, though, the, two, maintained, a, strained, friendship, when, in, 1739, wesley, preached, a, sermon, on, freedom, of, grace, attacking, the, calvinistic, understanding, of, predestination, as, blasphemous, as, it, represented, god, as, worse, than, the, devil, whitefield, asked, him, not, to, repeat, or, publish, the, discourse, as, he, did, not, want, a, dispute, wesley, published, his, sermon, anyway, whitefield, was, one, of, many, who, responded, the, two, men, separated, their, practice, in, 1741, wesley, wrote, that, those, who, held, to, unlimited, atonement, did, not, desire, separation, but, those, who, held, particular, redemption, would, not, hear, of, any, accommodation, whitefield, howell, harris, leader, of, the, welsh, methodist, revival, john, cennick, and, others, became, the, founders, of, calvinistic, methodism, whitefield, and, wesley, however, were, soon, back, on, friendly, terms, and, their, friendship, remained, unbroken, although, they, travelled, different, paths, when, someone, asked, whitefield, if, he, thought, he, would, see, wesley, in, heaven, whitefield, replied, i, fear, not, for, he, will, be, so, near, the, eternal, throne, and, we, at, such, a, distance, we, shall, hardly, get, sight, of, him, in, 1770, the, controversy, broke, out, anew, with, violence, and, bitterness, as, people, s, view, of, god, related, to, their, views, of, men, and, their, possibilities, augustus, toplady, daniel, rowland, sir, richard, hill, and, others, were, engaged, on, one, side, while, wesley, and, fletcher, stood, on, the, other, toplady, was, editor, of, the, gospel, magazine, which, had, articles, covering, the, controversy, in, 1778, wesley, began, the, publication, of, the, arminian, magazine, not, he, said, to, convince, calvinists, but, to, preserve, methodists, he, wanted, to, teach, the, truth, that, god, willeth, all, men, to, be, saved, a, lasting, peace, could, be, secured, in, no, other, way, some, have, suggested, that, later, in, life, wesley, may, have, embraced, the, doctrine, of, universal, salvation, although, this, is, disputed, the, claim, is, supported, by, a, letter, wesley, wrote, in, 1787, in, which, he, endorsed, as, one, of, the, most, sensible, tracts, i, have, ever, read, a, work, by, charles, bonnet, in, which, the, author, s, conclusion, was, there, will, therefore, be, a, perpetual, advance, of, all, the, individuals, of, humanity, towards, greater, perfection, or, greater, happiness, later, in, his, ministry, wesley, was, a, keen, abolitionist, speaking, out, and, writing, against, the, slave, trade, wesley, denounced, slavery, as, the, sum, of, all, villainies, and, detailed, its, abuses, he, addressed, the, slave, trade, in, a, polemical, tract, titled, thoughts, upon, slavery, in, 1774, he, wrote, liberty, is, the, right, of, every, human, creature, as, soon, as, he, breathes, the, vital, air, and, no, human, law, can, deprive, him, of, that, right, which, he, derives, from, the, law, of, nature, wesley, influenced, george, whitefield, to, journey, to, the, colonies, spurring, the, transatlantic, debate, on, slavery, wesley, was, a, mentor, to, william, wilberforce, who, was, also, influential, in, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, british, empire, it, is, thanks, to, wesley, s, abolitionist, message, that, a, young, african, american, richard, allen, converted, to, christianity, in, 1777, and, later, founded, in, 1816, the, african, methodist, episcopal, church, ame, in, the, methodist, tradition, women, had, an, active, role, in, wesley, s, methodism, and, were, encouraged, to, lead, classes, in, 1761, he, informally, allowed, sarah, crosby, one, of, his, converts, and, a, class, leader, to, preach, on, an, occasion, where, over, 200, people, attended, a, class, she, was, meant, to, teach, crosby, felt, as, though, she, could, not, fulfil, her, duties, as, a, class, leader, given, the, large, crowd, and, decided, to, preach, instead, she, wrote, to, wesley, to, seek, his, advice, and, forgiveness, he, let, crosby, continue, her, preaching, so, long, as, she, refrained, from, as, many, of, the, mannerisms, of, preaching, as, she, could, between, 1761, and, 1771, wesley, wrote, detailed, instructions, to, crosby, and, others, with, specifics, on, what, styles, of, preaching, they, could, use, for, instance, in, 1769, wesley, allowed, crosby, to, give, exhortations, in, the, summer, of, 1771, mary, bosanquet, wrote, to, john, wesley, to, defend, her, and, sarah, crosby, s, work, preaching, and, leading, classes, at, her, orphanage, cross, hall, bosanquet, s, letter, is, considered, to, be, the, first, full, and, true, defence, of, women, s, preaching, in, methodism, her, argument, was, that, women, should, be, able, to, preach, when, they, experienced, an, extraordinary, call, or, when, given, permission, from, god, wesley, accepted, bosanquet, s, argument, and, formally, began, to, allow, women, to, preach, in, methodism, in, 1771, methodist, women, including, preachers, continued, to, observe, the, ancient, practice, of, christian, head, covering, wesley, travelled, widely, generally, on, horseback, preaching, two, or, three, times, each, day, stephen, tomkins, writes, that, rode, 250, 000, miles, gave, away, 30, 000, pounds, and, preached, more, than, 40, 000, sermons, he, formed, societies, opened, chapels, examined, and, commissioned, preachers, administered, aid, charities, prescribed, for, the, sick, helped, to, pioneer, the, use, of, electric, shock, for, the, treatment, of, illness, and, superintended, orphanages, and, schools, including, kingswood, school, wesley, practised, a, vegetarian, diet, and, in, later, life, abstained, from, wine, for, health, reasons, he, wrote, thanks, be, to, god, since, the, time, i, gave, up, flesh, meals, and, wine, i, have, been, delivered, from, all, physical, ills, wesley, warned, against, the, dangers, of, alcohol, abuse, in, his, famous, sermon, the, use, of, money, and, in, his, letter, to, an, alcoholic, in, his, sermon, on, public, diversions, wesley, says, you, see, the, wine, when, it, sparkles, in, the, cup, and, are, going, to, drink, of, it, i, tell, you, there, is, poison, in, it, and, therefore, beg, you, to, throw, it, away, these, statements, against, alcohol, use, largely, concerned, hard, liquors, and, spirits, rather, than, the, low, alcohol, beer, which, was, often, safer, to, drink, than, the, contaminated, water, of, that, time, methodist, churches, became, pioneers, in, the, teetotal, temperance, movement, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, and, later, it, became, de, rigueur, in, british, methodism, he, attended, music, concerts, and, was, especially, an, admirer, of, charles, avison, after, attending, a, performance, in, bristol, cathedral, in, 1758, wesley, recorded, in, his, journal, i, went, to, the, cathedral, to, hear, mr, handel, s, messiah, i, doubt, if, that, congregation, was, ever, so, serious, at, a, sermon, as, they, were, during, this, performance, in, many, places, especially, several, of, the, choruses, it, exceeded, my, expectation, he, is, described, as, rather, under, the, medium, height, well, proportioned, strong, with, a, bright, eye, a, clear, complexion, and, a, saintly, intellectual, face, though, wesley, favoured, celibacy, rather, than, marital, bond, he, married, very, unhappily, in, 1751, at, the, age, of, 48, to, a, widow, mary, vazeille, described, as, a, well, to, do, widow, and, mother, of, four, children, the, couple, had, no, children, john, singleton, writes, by, 1758, she, had, left, him, unable, to, cope, it, is, said, with, the, competition, for, his, time, and, devotion, presented, by, the, ever, burgeoning, methodist, movement, molly, as, she, was, known, was, to, return, and, leave, him, again, on, several, occasions, before, their, final, separation, wesley, wryly, reported, in, his, journal, i, did, not, forsake, her, i, did, not, dismiss, her, i, will, not, recall, her, in, 1770, at, the, death, of, george, whitefield, wesley, wrote, a, memorial, sermon, which, praised, whitefield, s, admirable, qualities, and, acknowledged, the, two, men, s, differences, there, are, many, doctrines, of, a, less, essential, nature, in, these, we, may, think, and, let, think, we, may, agree, to, disagree, but, meantime, let, us, hold, fast, the, essentials, wesley, may, have, been, the, first, to, use, agree, to, disagree, in, print, in, the, modern, sense, of, tolerating, differences, though, he, himself, attributed, the, saying, to, whitefield, and, it, had, appeared, in, other, senses, previously, wesley, was, gravely, ill, during, a, visit, to, lisburn, in, ireland, in, june, 1775, he, stayed, at, the, home, of, a, leading, methodist, henrietta, gayer, where, he, recovered, wesley, s, health, declined, sharply, towards, the, end, of, his, life, and, he, ceased, preaching, on, 28, june, 1790, less, than, a, year, before, his, death, he, wrote, this, day, i, enter, into, my, eighty, eighth, year, for, above, eighty, six, years, i, found, none, of, the, infirmities, of, old, age, my, eyes, did, not, wax, dim, neither, was, my, natural, strength, abated, but, last, august, i, found, almost, a, sudden, change, my, eyes, were, so, dim, that, no, glasses, would, help, me, my, strength, likewise, now, quite, forsook, me, and, probably, will, not, return, in, this, world, wesley, was, cared, for, during, his, last, months, by, elizabeth, ritchie, and, his, physician, john, whitehead, he, died, on, 2, march, 1791, at, the, age, of, 87, as, he, lay, dying, his, friends, gathered, around, him, wesley, grasped, their, hands, and, said, repeatedly, farewell, farewell, at, the, end, he, said, the, best, of, all, is, god, is, with, us, lifted, his, arms, and, raised, his, feeble, voice, again, repeating, the, words, the, best, of, all, is, god, is, with, us, he, was, entombed, at, his, chapel, on, city, road, london, ritchie, wrote, an, account, of, his, death, which, was, quoted, from, by, whitehead, at, his, funeral, because, of, his, charitable, nature, he, died, poor, leaving, as, the, result, of, his, life, s, work, 135, 000, members, and, 541, itinerant, preachers, under, the, name, methodist, it, has, been, said, that, when, john, wesley, was, carried, to, his, grave, he, left, behind, him, a, good, library, of, books, a, well, worn, clergyman, s, gown, and, the, methodist, church, wesley, wrote, edited, or,
