jean, baptiste, racine, r, s, i, n, rass, een, us, also, r, s, i, n, r, seen, french, 22, december, 1639, 21, april, 1699, was, a, french, dramatist, one, of, the, three, great, playwrights, of, 17th, century, france, along, with, moli, re, and, corneille, as, well, as, an, important, literary, figure, in, the, western, tradition, and, world, literature, racine, was, primarily, a, tragedian, producing, such, examples, of, neoclassical, perfection, as, ph, dre, andromaque, and, athalie, he, did, write, one, comedy, les, plaideurs, and, a, muted, tragedy, esther, for, the, young, racine, s, plays, displayed, his, mastery, of, the, dodecasyllabic, 12, syllable, french, alexandrine, his, writing, is, renowned, for, its, elegance, purity, speed, and, fury, and, for, what, american, poet, robert, lowell, described, as, a, diamond, edge, and, the, glory, of, its, hard, electric, rage, racine, s, dramaturgy, is, marked, by, his, psychological, insight, the, prevailing, passion, of, his, characters, and, the, nakedness, of, both, plot, and, stage, racine, was, born, on, 21, december, 1639, in, la, fert, milon, aisne, in, the, province, of, picardy, in, northern, france, orphaned, by, the, age, of, four, his, mother, died, in, 1641, and, his, father, in, 1643, he, came, into, the, care, of, his, grandparents, at, the, death, of, his, grandfather, in, 1649, his, grandmother, marie, des, moulins, went, to, live, in, the, convent, of, port, royal, and, took, her, grandson, with, her, he, received, a, classical, education, at, the, petites, coles, de, port, royal, a, religious, institution, which, would, greatly, influence, other, contemporary, figures, including, blaise, pascal, port, royal, was, run, by, followers, of, jansenism, a, theology, condemned, as, heretical, by, the, french, bishops, and, the, pope, racine, s, interactions, with, the, jansenists, in, his, years, at, this, academy, would, have, great, influence, over, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, port, royal, he, excelled, in, his, studies, of, the, classics, and, the, themes, of, greek, and, roman, mythology, would, play, large, roles, in, his, future, works, he, was, expected, to, study, law, at, the, coll, ge, d, harcourt, in, paris, but, instead, found, himself, drawn, to, a, more, artistic, lifestyle, experimenting, with, poetry, drew, high, praise, from, france, s, greatest, literary, critic, nicolas, boileau, with, whom, racine, would, later, become, great, friends, boileau, would, often, claim, that, he, was, behind, the, budding, poet, s, work, racine, eventually, took, up, residence, in, paris, where, he, became, involved, in, theatrical, circles, his, first, play, amasie, never, reached, the, stage, on, 20, june, 1664, racine, s, tragedy, la, th, ba, de, ou, les, fr, res, ennemis, the, thebans, or, the, enemy, brothers, was, produced, by, moli, re, s, troupe, at, the, th, tre, du, palais, royal, in, paris, the, following, year, moli, re, also, put, on, racine, s, second, play, alexandre, le, grand, however, this, play, garnered, such, good, feedback, from, the, public, that, racine, secretly, negotiated, with, a, rival, play, company, the, h, tel, de, bourgogne, to, perform, the, play, since, they, had, a, better, reputation, for, performing, tragedies, thus, alexandre, premiered, for, the, second, time, by, a, different, acting, troupe, eleven, days, after, its, first, showing, moli, re, could, never, forgive, racine, for, this, betrayal, and, racine, simply, widened, the, rift, between, him, and, his, former, friend, by, seducing, moli, re, s, leading, actress, th, r, se, du, parc, into, becoming, his, companion, both, professionally, and, personally, from, this, point, on, the, h, tel, de, bourgogne, troupe, performed, all, of, racine, s, secular, plays, though, both, la, th, ba, de, 1664, and, its, successor, alexandre, 1665, had, classical, themes, racine, was, already, entering, into, controversy, and, forced, to, field, accusations, that, he, was, polluting, the, minds, of, his, audiences, he, broke, all, ties, with, port, royal, and, proceeded, with, andromaque, 1667, which, told, the, story, of, andromache, widow, of, hector, and, her, fate, following, the, trojan, war, amongst, his, rivals, were, pierre, corneille, and, his, brother, thomas, corneille, tragedians, often, competed, with, alternative, versions, of, the, same, plot, for, example, michel, le, clerc, produced, an, iphig, nie, in, the, same, year, as, racine, 1674, and, jacques, pradon, also, wrote, a, play, about, ph, dre, 1677, the, success, of, pradon, s, work, the, result, of, the, activities, of, a, claque, was, one, of, the, events, which, caused, racine, to, renounce, his, work, as, a, dramatist, at, that, time, even, though, his, career, up, to, this, point, was, so, successful, that, he, was, the, first, french, author, to, live, almost, entirely, on, the, money, he, earned, from, his, writings, others, including, the, historian, warren, lewis, attribute, his, retirement, from, the, theater, to, qualms, of, conscience, however, one, major, incident, which, seems, to, have, contributed, to, racine, s, departure, from, public, life, was, his, implication, in, a, court, scandal, of, 1679, he, got, married, at, about, this, time, to, the, pious, catherine, de, romanet, and, his, religious, beliefs, and, devotion, to, the, jansenist, sect, were, revived, he, and, his, wife, eventually, had, two, sons, and, five, daughters, around, the, time, of, his, marriage, and, departure, from, the, theatre, racine, accepted, a, position, as, a, royal, historiographer, in, the, court, of, king, louis, xiv, alongside, his, friend, boileau, he, kept, this, position, in, spite, of, the, minor, scandals, he, was, involved, in, in, 1672, he, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, eventually, gaining, much, power, over, this, organisation, two, years, later, he, was, given, the, title, of, treasurer, of, france, and, he, was, later, distinguished, as, an, ordinary, gentleman, of, the, king, 1690, and, then, as, a, secretary, of, the, king, 1696, because, of, racine, s, flourishing, career, in, the, court, louis, xiv, provided, for, his, widow, and, children, after, his, death, when, at, last, he, returned, to, the, theatre, it, was, at, the, request, of, madame, de, maintenon, morganatic, second, wife, of, king, louis, xiv, with, the, moral, fables, esther, 1689, and, athalie, 1691, both, of, which, were, based, on, old, testament, stories, and, intended, for, performance, by, the, pupils, of, the, school, of, the, maison, royale, de, saint, louis, in, saint, cyr, a, commune, neighboring, versailles, and, now, known, as, saint, cyr, l, cole, jean, racine, died, in, 1699, from, cancer, of, the, liver, he, requested, burial, in, port, royal, but, after, louis, xiv, had, this, site, razed, in, 1710, his, remains, were, moved, to, the, saint, tienne, du, mont, church, in, paris, the, quality, of, racine, s, poetry, is, perhaps, his, greatest, contribution, to, french, literature, his, use, of, the, alexandrine, poetic, line, is, considered, exceptionally, skilful, racine, s, work, faced, many, criticisms, from, his, contemporaries, one, was, the, lack, of, historic, veracity, in, plays, such, as, britannicus, 1669, and, mithridate, 1673, racine, was, quick, to, point, out, that, his, greatest, critics, his, rival, dramatists, were, among, the, biggest, offenders, in, this, respect, another, major, criticism, levelled, at, him, was, the, lack, of, incident, in, his, tragedy, b, r, nice, 1670, racine, s, response, was, that, the, greatest, tragedy, does, not, necessarily, consist, in, bloodshed, and, death, racine, restricts, his, vocabulary, to, 2500, words, he, rules, out, all, workaday, expressions, since, although, the, greeks, could, call, a, spade, a, spade, he, does, not, believe, that, this, is, possible, in, latin, or, french, the, classical, unities, are, strictly, observed, for, only, the, final, stage, of, a, prolonged, crisis, is, described, the, number, of, characters, all, of, them, royal, is, kept, down, to, the, barest, minimum, action, on, stage, is, all, but, eliminated, the, mangled, hippolyte, is, not, brought, back, as, is, the, hippolytus, of, euripides, the, one, exception, to, this, is, that, atalide, stabs, herself, before, the, audience, in, bajazet, but, this, is, acceptable, in, a, play, conspicuous, for, its, savagery, and, oriental, colour, tragedy, shows, how, men, fall, from, prosperity, to, disaster, the, higher, the, position, from, which, the, hero, falls, the, greater, is, the, tragedy, except, for, the, confidants, of, whom, narcisse, in, britannicus, and, none, in, ph, dre, are, the, most, significant, racine, describes, the, fate, of, kings, queens, princes, and, princesses, liberated, from, the, constricting, pressures, of, everyday, life, and, able, to, speak, and, act, without, inhibition, greek, tragedy, from, which, racine, borrowed, so, plentifully, tended, to, assume, that, humanity, was, under, the, control, of, gods, indifferent, to, its, sufferings, and, aspirations, in, the, dipus, tyrannus, sophocles, s, hero, becomes, gradually, aware, of, the, terrible, fact, that, however, hard, his, family, has, tried, to, avert, the, oracular, prophecy, he, has, nevertheless, killed, his, father, and, married, his, mother, and, must, now, pay, the, penalty, for, these, unwitting, crimes, the, same, awareness, of, a, cruel, fate, that, leads, innocent, men, and, women, into, sin, and, demands, retribution, of, the, equally, innocent, children, pervades, la, th, ba, de, a, play, that, itself, deals, with, the, legend, of, dipus, racine, is, often, said, to, have, been, deeply, influenced, by, the, jansenist, sense, of, fatalism, however, the, link, between, racine, s, tragedy, and, jansenism, has, been, disputed, on, multiple, grounds, for, example, racine, himself, denied, any, connection, to, jansenism, as, a, christian, racine, could, no, longer, assume, as, did, schylus, and, sophocles, that, god, is, merciless, in, leading, men, to, a, doom, which, they, do, not, foresee, instead, destiny, becomes, at, least, in, the, secular, plays, the, uncontrollable, frenzy, of, unrequited, love, as, already, in, the, works, of, euripides, the, gods, have, become, more, symbolic, venus, represents, the, unquenchable, force, of, sexual, passion, within, the, human, being, in, euripides, hippolytus, but, closely, allied, to, this, indeed, indistinguishable, from, it, is, the, atavistic, strain, of, monstrous, aberration, that, had, caused, her, mother, pasipha, to, mate, with, a, bull, and, give, birth, to, the, minotaur, thus, in, racine, the, hamartia, which, the, thirteenth, chapter, of, aristotle, s, poetics, had, declared, a, characteristic, of, tragedy, is, not, merely, an, action, performed, in, all, good, faith, which, subsequently, has, the, direst, consequences, dipus, s, killing, a, stranger, on, the, road, to, thebes, and, marrying, the, widowed, queen, of, thebes, after, solving, the, sphinx, s, riddle, nor, is, it, simply, an, error, of, judgment, as, when, deianira, in, the, hercules, furens, of, seneca, the, younger, kills, her, husband, when, intending, to, win, back, his, love, it, is, a, flaw, of, character, in, a, second, important, respect, racine, is, at, variance, with, the, greek, pattern, of, tragedy, his, tragic, characters, are, aware, of, but, can, do, nothing, to, overcome, the, blemish, which, leads, them, on, to, a, catastrophe, and, the, tragic, recognition, or, anagnorisis, of, wrongdoing, is, not, confined, as, in, the, dipus, tyrannus, to, the, end, of, the, play, when, the, fulfilment, of, the, prophecy, is, borne, in, upon, dipus, ph, dre, realizes, from, the, very, beginning, the, monstrousness, of, her, passion, and, preserves, throughout, the, play, a, lucidity, of, mind, that, enables, her, to, analyse, and, reflect, upon, this, fatal, and, hereditary, weakness, hermione, s, situation, is, rather, closer, to, that, of, greek, tragedy, her, love, for, pyrrhus, is, perfectly, natural, and, is, not, in, itself, a, flaw, of, character, but, despite, her, extraordinary, lucidity, ii, 1, v, 1, in, analysing, her, violently, fluctuating, states, of, mind, she, is, blind, to, the, fact, that, the, king, does, not, really, love, her, iii, 3, and, this, weakness, on, her, part, which, leads, directly, to, the, tragic, peripeteia, of, iii, 7, is, the, hamartia, from, which, the, tragic, outcome, arises, for, racine, love, closely, resembles, a, physiological, disorder, it, is, a, fatal, illness, with, alternating, moods, of, calm, and, crisis, and, with, deceptive, hopes, of, recovery, or, fulfilment, andromaque, ll, 1441, 1448, ph, dre, ll, 767, 768, the, final, remission, culminating, in, a, quick, death, his, main, characters, are, monsters, and, stand, out, in, glaring, contrast, to, the, regularity, of, the, plays, structure, and, versification, the, suffering, lover, hermione, roxane, or, ph, dre, is, aware, of, nothing, except, her, suffering, and, the, means, whereby, it, can, be, relieved, her, love, is, not, founded, upon, esteem, of, the, beloved, and, a, concern, for, his, happiness, and, welfare, but, is, essentially, selfish, in, a, torment, of, jealousy, she, tries, to, relieve, the, pangs, of, despised, love, by, having, or, in, ph, dre, s, case, allowing, him, to, be, put, to, death, and, thus, associating, him, with, her, own, suffering, the, depth, of, tragedy, is, reached, when, hermione, realizes, that, pyrrhus, s, love, for, andromaque, continues, beyond, the, grave, or, when, ph, dre, contrasts, the, young, lovers, purity, with, her, unnaturalness, which, should, be, hidden, from, the, light, of, day, racine, s, most, distinctive, contribution, to, literature, is, his, conception, of, the, ambivalence, of, love, ne, puis, je, savoir, si, j, aime, ou, si, je, hais, the, passion, of, these, lovers, is, totally, destructive, of, their, dignity, as, human, beings, and, usually, kills, them, or, deprives, them, of, their, reason, except, for, titus, and, b, r, nice, they, are, blinded, by, it, to, all, sense, of, duty, pyrrhus, casts, off, his, fianc, e, in, order, to, marry, a, slave, from, an, enemy, country, for, whom, he, is, prepared, to, repudiate, his, alliances, with, the, greeks, orestes, duties, as, an, ambassador, are, subordinate, to, his, aspirations, as, a, lover, and, he, finally, murders, the, king, to, whom, he, has, been, sent, n, ron, s, passion, for, junie, causes, him, to, poison, britannicus, and, thus, after, two, years, of, virtuous, government, to, inaugurate, a, tyranny, the, characteristic, racinian, framework, is, that, of, the, eternal, triangle, two, young, lovers, a, prince, and, a, princess, being, thwarted, in, their, love, by, a, third, person, usually, a, queen, whose, love, for, the, young, prince, is, unreciprocated, ph, dre, destroys, the, possibility, of, a, marriage, between, hippolyte, and, aricie, bajazet,

state, in, andromaque, the, system, of, unrequited, passions, borrowed, from, tragicomedy, alters, the, dramatic, scheme, and, hermione, destroys, a, man, who, has, been, her, fianc, but, who, has, remained, indifferent, to, her, and, is, now, marrying, a, woman, who, does, not, love, him, the, young, princes, and, princesses, are, agreeable, display, varying, degrees, of, innocence, and, optimism, and, are, the, victims, of, evil, machinations, and, the, love, hatred, characteristic, of, racine, the, king, pyrrhus, n, ron, titus, mithridate, agamemnon, th, s, e, holds, the, power, of, life, and, death, over, the, other, characters, pyrrhus, forces, andromaque, to, choose, between, marrying, him, and, seeing, her, son, killed, after, keeping, his, fianc, e, waiting, in, epirus, for, a, year, he, announces, his, intention, of, marrying, her, only, to, change, his, mind, almost, immediately, afterwards, mithridate, discovers, pharnace, s, love, for, monime, by, spreading, a, false, rumour, of, his, own, death, by, pretending, to, renounce, his, fianc, e, he, finds, that, she, had, formerly, loved, his, other, son, xiphar, s, wrongly, informed, that, xiphar, s, has, been, killed, fighting, pharnace, and, the, romans, he, orders, monime, to, take, poison, dying, he, unites, the, two, lovers, th, s, e, is, a, rather, nebulous, character, primarily, important, in, his, influence, upon, the, mechanism, of, the, plot, ph, dre, declares, her, love, to, hippolyte, on, hearing, the, false, news, of, his, death, his, unexpected, return, throws, her, into, confusion, and, lends, substance, to, none, s, allegations, in, his, all, too, human, blindness, he, condemns, to, death, his, own, son, on, a, charge, of, which, he, is, innocent, only, amurat, does, not, actually, appear, on, stage, and, yet, his, presence, is, constantly, felt, his, intervention, by, means, of, the, letter, condemning, bajazet, to, death, iv, 3, precipitates, the, catastrophe, the, queen, shows, greater, variations, from, play, to, play, than, anyone, else, and, is, always, the, most, carefully, delineated, character, hermione, for, she, rather, than, the, pathetic, and, emotionally, stable, andromaque, has, a, r, le, equivalent, to, that, generally, played, by, the, queen, is, young, with, all, the, freshness, of, a, first, and, only, love, she, is, ruthless, in, using, oreste, as, her, instrument, of, vengeance, and, she, is, so, cruel, in, her, brief, moment, of, triumph, that, she, refuses, to, intercede, for, astyanax, s, life, agrippine, an, ageing, and, forlorn, woman, fille, femme, s, ur, et, m, re, de, vos, ma, tres, who, has, stopped, at, nothing, in, order, to, put, her, own, son, on, the, throne, vainly, tries, to, reassert, her, influence, over, n, ron, by, espousing, the, cause, of, a, prince, whom, she, had, excluded, from, the, succession, roxane, the, fiercest, and, bravest, in, racine, s, gallery, of, queens, has, no, compunction, in, ordering, bajazet, s, death, and, indeed, banishes, him, from, her, presence, even, before, he, has, finished, justifying, himself, clytemnestre, is, gentle, and, kind, but, quite, ineffectual, in, rescuing, her, daughter, iphig, nie, from, the, threat, of, sacrifice, ph, dre, passive, and, irresolute, allows, herself, to, be, led, by, none, deeply, conscious, of, the, impurity, of, her, love, she, sees, it, as, an, atavistic, trait, and, a, punishment, of, the, gods, and, she, is, so, consumed, by, jealousy, that, she, can, do, nothing, to, save, her, beloved, from, the, curse, the, confidants, primary, function, is, to, make, monologues, unnecessary, only, very, rarely, do, they, further, the, action, they, invariably, reflect, the, character, of, their, masters, and, mistresses, thus, narcisse, and, burrhus, symbolize, the, warring, elements, of, evil, and, good, within, the, youthful, n, ron, but, narcisse, is, more, than, a, reflection, he, betrays, and, finally, poisons, his, master, britannicus, burrhus, on, the, other, hand, is, the, conventional, good, angel, of, the, medieval, morality, play, he, is, a, much, less, colourful, character, than, his, opposite, number, none, ph, dre, s, evil, genius, persuades, her, mistress, to, tell, hippolyte, of, her, incestuous, passion, and, incriminates, the, young, prince, on, th, s, e, s, unexpected, return, c, phise, knowing, how, deeply, attached, pyrrhus, is, to, her, mistress, urges, the, despairing, andromaque, to, make, a, last, appeal, to, him, on, her, son, s, behalf, and, so, changes, the, course, of, the, play, racine, observes, the, dramatic, unities, more, closely, than, the, greek, tragedians, had, done, the, philosopher, aristotle, points, out, the, ways, in, which, tragedy, differs, from, epic, poetry, tragedy, generally, tries, to, limit, its, action, to, a, period, of, twenty, four, hours, or, not, much, exceeding, that, whilst, epic, poetry, is, unlimited, in, point, of, time, writing, centuries, after, the, great, attic, tragedians, and, using, their, works, as, a, basis, for, generalization, he, does, not, insist, that, the, action, of, a, tragedy, must, be, confined, to, a, single, revolution, of, the, sun, or, that, it, must, take, place, in, one, locality, he, merely, says, that, this, limitation, was, often, practised, by, writers, of, tragedy, but, he, well, knew, that, there, were, many, plays, in, which, no, such, limitation, existed, for, instance, schylus, s, agamemnon, compresses, into, about, fifteen, minutes, a, journey, from, troy, to, argos, which, must, have, taken, several, days, nor, was, the, unity, of, place, a, general, feature, of, attic, tragedy, schylus, s, the, eumenides, has, two, settings, and, in, the, suppliants, of, euripides, it, is, sometimes, impossible, to, tell, where, the, action, is, taking, place, at, all, but, the, circumstances, of, the, greek, theatre, which, had, no, curtain, and, no, distinctive, scenery, and, in, which, the, chorus, almost, always, remained, on, stage, throughout, the, play, were, such, that, it, was, frequently, desirable, to, confine, the, action, to, a, single, day, and, a, single, place, the, only, rule, which, aristotle, lays, down, concerning, the, dramatic, action, is, that, in, common, with, all, other, forms, of, art, a, tragedy, must, have, an, internal, unity, so, that, every, part, of, it, is, in, an, organic, relationship, to, the, whole, and, no, part, can, be, changed, or, left, out, without, detracting, from, the, economy, of, the, play, no, dramatic, critic, has, ever, dissented, from, this, unity, of, action, but, the, unities, of, time, and, place, were, in, fact, read, into, the, poetics, by, theoreticians, of, the, new, learning, jean, de, la, taille, and, other, writers, jean, vauquelin, de, la, fresnaye, and, jean, mairet, the, support, which, the, unities, received, from, cardinal, richelieu, eventually, secured, their, complete, triumph, and, pierre, corneille, who, had, not, conformed, to, them, in, his, earlier, plays, did, so, from, the, time, of, le, cid, 1636, onwards, but, even, he, found, them, a, tiresome, imposition, only, by, a, very, ready, suspension, of, disbelief, can, we, accept, that, in, the, space, of, twenty, four, hours, el, cid, kills, chim, ne, s, father, in, a, duel, overwhelms, the, moorish, invaders, during, the, night, and, fights, a, second, duel, only, a, few, hours, after, the, enemy, has, fled, these, discrepancies, and, others, besides, which, corneille, admits, to, in, his, examen, of, the, play, are, obvious, even, to, the, most, inattentive, spectator, unlike, his, rival, who, crams, into, his, plays, quantit, d, incidents, qui, ne, se, pourraient, passer, qu, en, un, mois, racine, describes, fluctuating, states, of, mind, which, in, the, rapidly, mounting, tension, are, brought, abruptly, to, a, crisis, from, which, there, is, no, retreat, the, so, called, aristotelian, rules, happen, to, suit, this, type, of, drama, perfectly, since, they, lead, the, playwright, to, concentrate, the, tragic, action, on, those, few, hours, when, after, months, or, years, of, emotional, tension, a, new, event, supervenes, and, precipitates, the, catastrophe, the, most, striking, evidence, of, racine, s, success, in, fitting, his, tragedies, into, this, very, stringent, framework, is, that, when, watching, them, the, audience, ceases, to, be, aware, that, the, unities, exist, not, long, before, he, wrote, ph, dre, the, same, subject, had, been, dealt, with, by, gabriel, gilbert, and, mathieu, bidar, both, of, whom, had, kept, hippolyte, off, stage, after, act, iv, racine, on, the, other, hand, brings, him, into, act, v, scene, 1, the, last, line, of, which, is, only, seventy, or, eighty, lines, earlier, than, th, ram, ne, s, r, cit, in, v, 6, in, the, four, minutes, which, these, lines, take, to, recite, the, young, prince, has, gone, out, with, th, ram, ne, has, met,

therefore, in, the, space, of, two, short, scenes, has, met, her, dying, lover, on, the, seashore, and, has, taken, her, leave, of, him, these, chronological, inconsistencies, pass, unnoticed, in, the, theatre, racine, invariably, observes, the, unity, of, place, a, room, in, pyrrhus, s, palace, at, buthrotum, an, antechamber, separating, the, apartments, of, titus, and, b, r, nice, in, rome, agamemnon, s, camp, at, aulis, an, antechamber, in, the, temple, at, jerusalem, by, choosing, such, vague, and, remote, settings, racine, gives, his, plays, a, universal, character, and, the, presentation, of, conflicting, and, hesitating, states, of, mind, is, not, hampered, by, an, undue, insistence, on, material, surroundings, at, times, of, course, the, unity, of, place, leads, to, slightly, far, fetched, meetings, why, for, instance, does, pyrrhus, come, to, see, oreste, act, i, sc, 2, rather, than, the, other, way, around, except, to, conform, to, this, rule, lastly, the, unity, of, place, necessitates, the, r, cit, and, this, again, is, in, complete, harmony, with, racine, s, fundamental, aims, how, would, andromaque, gain, by, our, being, able, to, see, pyrrhus, and, his, bride, approach, and, enter, the, temple, the, important, fact, is, the, effect, of, cl, one, s, words, upon, hermione, oreste, s, relating, to, hermione, the, murder, of, pyrrhus, is, the, supreme, irony, of, the, play, th, ram, ne, s, r, cit, describes, in, the, most, memorable, and, poetic, language, an, event, which, would, be, infinitely, less, moving, if, it, were, to, be, seen, it, imperfectly, represented, upon, the, stage, as, regards, the, unity, of, action, racine, differs, sharply, from, william, shakespeare, in, excluding, minor, plots, compare, the, parallel, themes, of, blind, and, unnatural, fatherhood, and, the, retribution, it, invokes, in, king, lear, and, in, ruling, out, the, comic, element, the, fact, that, act, ii, scene, 5, of, andromaque, or, many, of, the, scenes, of, alexandre, le, grand, and, mithridate, have, comic, undertones, is, beside, the, point, will, andromaque, agree, to, marry, pyrrhus, will, agamemnon, sacrifice, iphig, nie, can, esther, persuade, her, husband, to, spare, the, jews, the, plots, of, bajazet, ph, dre, and, athalie, are, scarcely, more, complex, than, the, rest, unlike, such, plays, as, hamlet, and, the, tempest, in, which, a, dramatic, first, scene, precedes, the, exposition, a, racinian, tragedy, opens, very, quietly, but, even, so, in, a, mood, of, suspense, in, andromaque, pyrrhus, s, unenviable, wavering, between, hermione, and, the, eponymous, heroine, has, been, going, on, for, a, year, and, has, exasperated, all, three, up, to, the, time, when, britannicus, begins, n, ron, has, been, a, good, ruler, a, faithful, disciple, of, seneca, and, burrhus, and, a, dutiful, son, but, he, is, now, beginning, to, show, a, spirit, of, independence, with, the, introduction, of, a, new, element, oreste, s,

situation, becomes, or, has, become, critical, in, a, darkening, atmosphere, a, succession, of, fluctuating, states, of, mind, on, the, part, of, the, main, characters, brings, us, to, the, resolution, generally, in, the, fourth, act, but, not, always, bajazet, athalie, of, what, by, now, is, an, unbearable, discordance, hermione, entrusts, the, killing, of, pyrrhus, to, oreste, wavers, for, a, moment, when, the, king, comes, into, her, presence, then, condemns, him, with, her, own, mouth, no, sooner, has, burrhus, regained, his, old, ascendancy, over, n, ron, and, reconciled, him, with, his, half, brother, than, narcisse, most, skilfully, overcomes, the, emperor, s, scruples, of, conscience, and, sets, him, on, a, career, of, vice, of, which, britannicus, s, murder, is, merely, the, prelude, by, the, beginning, of, act, iv, of, ph, dre, none, has, besmirched, hippolyte, s, character, and, the, queen, does, nothing, during, that, act, to, exculpate, him, with, the, working, out, of, a, situation, usually, decided, by, the, end, of, act, iv, the, tragedies, move, to, a, swift, conclusion, in, the, religious, plays, racine, is, fairly, scrupulous, in, adhering, to, his, old, testament, sources, taking, care, to, put, into, the, mouth, of, joad, the, second, jehoiada, only, those, prophetic, utterances, that, are, to, be, found, in, the, bible, nevertheless, he, takes, advantage, of, a, verse, in, ii, chronicles, xxiv, attributing, the, gift, of, prophecy, to, joad, s, son, zacharie, zechariah, ben, jehoiada, in, order, to, suppose, that, the, father, whom, the, bible, does, not, describe, as, a, prophet, likewise, had, prophetic, powers, and, thinking, a, child, of, seven, the, age, of, joas, jehoash, of, judah, in, the, second, book, of, kings, too, young, to, have, the, part, given, him, in, athalie, racine, makes, him, into, a, boy, of, nine, or, ten, on, the, evidence, of, the, septuagint, version, of, ii, chronicles, xxiii, 1, in, the, secular, plays, he, takes, far, greater, liberties, the, frequently, conflicting, sources, of, greek, and, roman, mythology, enable, him, to, fashion, the, plot, he, thinks, suitable, to, his, characters, and, above, all, to, present, the, old, stories, in, a, modern, light, whereas, euripides, in, his, iphigenia, in, aulis, averts, the, heroine, s, death, only, by, causing, artemis, to, spirit, her, away, to, tauris, putting, a, hart, in, her, place, on, the, sacrificial, altar, racine, determined, to, avoid, the, miraculous, borrows, from, a, minor, greek, writer, the, geographer, pausanias, the, character, of, riphile, the, disclosure, that, iphig, nie, s, treacherous, rival, was, herself, called, iphigeneia, at, birth, and, should, be, sacrificed, in, the, heroine, s, place, prevents, a, tragic, outcome, in, creating, andromaque, racine, believes, he, must, conformer, l, id, e, que, nous, avons, maintenant, de, cette, princesse, astyanax, whom, euripides, describes, in, the, trojan, women, and, the, andromache, as, having, been, thrown, from, the, walls, of, troy, and, killed, and, whose, death, is, foreshadowed, in, book, 24, of, the, iliad, is, made, to, survive, the, capture, of, troy, and, the, extinction, of, his, dynasty, in, another, respect, also, racine, departs, from, the, lines, laid, down, by, the, andromache, for, whereas, in, the, earlier, play, the, heroine, fears, that, the, son, she, has, had, by, pyrrhus, may, suffer, death, if, she, refuses, to, marry, the, father, the, later, heroine, fears, for, the, life, of, a, legitimate, son, the, reason, for, these, changes, in, the, homeric, and, euripidean, traditions, is, obvious, if, andromaque, had, been, pyrrhus, s, mistress, as, in, euripides, why, should, she, refuse, to, marry, him, racine, like, homer, conceives, her, as, sublimely, faithful, to, hector, yet, the, tension, iii, 8, between, maternal, love, and, a, reluctance, to, marry, pyrrhus, must, as, in, euripides, be, paramount, and, so, astyanax, is, brought, back, to, life, ph, dre, differs, from, euripides, s, hippolytus, and, seneca, the, younger, s, ph, dra, in, the, very, important, respect, that, taking, the, character, of, aricie, from, virgil, racine, introduces, the, jealousy, motive, despite, the, fact, that, hippolyte, ce, fils, chaste, et, respectueux, is, indifferent, to, her, ph, dre, will, not, consent, to, none, s, suggesting, to, th, s, e, that, the, son, has, made, improper, advances, to, the, stepmother, until, iv, 5, she, discovers, that, he, has, loved, aricie, all, along, racine, s, works, have, evoked, in, audiences, and, critics, a, wide, range, of, responses, ranging, from, reverence, to, revulsion, in, his, book, racine, a, study, 1974, philip, butler, of, the, university, of, wisconsin, broke, the, main, criticisms, of, racine, down, by, century, to, show, the, almost, constantly, shifting, perception, of, the, playwright, and, his, works, in, his, own, time, racine, found, himself, compared, constantly, with, his, contemporaries, especially, the, great, pierre, corneille, in, his, own, plays, racine, sought, to, abandon, the, ornate, and, almost, otherworldly, intricacy, that, corneille, so, favored, audiences, and, critics, were, divided, over, the, worth, of, racine, as, an, up, and, coming, playwright, audiences, admired, his, return, to, simplicity, and, their, ability, to, relate, to, his, more, human, characters, while, critics, insisted, on, judging, him, according, to, the, traditional, standards, of, aristotle, and, his, italian, commentators, from, which, he, tended, to, stray, attitudes, shifted, however, as, racine, began, to, eclipse, corneille, in, 1674, the, highly, respected, poet, and, critic, boileau, published, his, art, po, tique, which, deemed, racine, s, model, of, tragedy, superior, to, that, of, corneille, this, erased, all, doubts, as, to, racine, s, abilities, as, a, dramatist, and, established, him, as, one, of, the, period, s, great, literary, minds, butler, describes, this, period, as, racine, s, apotheosis, his, highest, point, of, admiration, racine, s, ascent, to, literary, fame, coincided, with, other, prodigious, cultural, and, political, events, in, french, history, this, period, saw, the, rise, of, literary, giants, like, moli, re, jean, de, la, fontaine, boileau, and, fran, ois, de, la, rochefoucauld, as, well, as, louis, le, vau, s, historic, expansion, of, the, palace, of, versailles, jean, baptiste, lully, s, revolution, in, baroque, music, and, most, importantly, the, ascension, of, louis, xiv, to, the, throne, of, france, during, louis, xiv, s, reign, france, rose, up, from, a, long, period, of, civil, discord, see, the, fronde, to, new, heights, of, international, prominence, political, achievement, coincided, with, cultural, and, gave, birth, to, an, evolution, of, france, s, national, identity, known, as, l, esprit, fran, ais, this, new, self, perception, acknowledged, the, superiority, of, all, things, french, the, french, believed, france, was, home, to, the, greatest, king, the, greatest, armies, the, greatest, people, and, subsequently, the, greatest, culture, in, this, new, national, mindset, racine, and, his, work, were, practically, deified, established, as, the, perfect, model, of, dramatic, tragedy, by, which, all, other, plays, would, be, judged, butler, blames, the, consequential, withering, of, french, drama, on, racine, s, idolized, image, saying, that, such, rigid, adherence, to, one, model, eventually, made, all, new, french, drama, a, stale, imitation, the, french, installation, of, racine, into, the, dramatic, and, literary, pantheon, evoked, harsh, criticism, from, many, sources, who, argued, against, his, perfection, germans, like, friedrich, schiller, and, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, dismissed, racine, as, h, fisches, drama, or, courtly, drama, too, restricted, by, the, tiquette, and, conventions, of, a, royal, court, for, the, true, expression, of, human, passion, french, critics, too, revolted, racine, came, to, be, dismissed, as, merely, an, historical, document, that, painted, a, picture, only, of, 17th, century, french, society, and, nothing, else, there, could, be, nothing, new, to, say, about, him, however, as, writers, like, charles, baudelaire, and, gustave, flaubert, came, onto, the, scene, to, soundly, shake, the, foundations, of, french, literature, conservative, readers, retreated, to, racine, for, the, nostalgia, of, his, simplicity, as, racine, returned, to, prominence, at, home, his, critics, abroad, remained, hostile, due, mainly, butler, argues, to, francophobia, the, british, were, especially, damning, preferring, shakespeare, and, sir, walter, scott, to, racine, whom, they, dismissed, as, didactic, and, commonplace, this, did, not, trouble, the, french, however, as, racine, la, fontaine, or, generally, speaking, the, chefs, d, uvre, de, l, esprit, humain, could, not, be, understood, by, foreigners, the, 20th, century, saw, a, renewed, effort, to, rescue, racine, and, his, works, from, the, chiefly, historical, perspective, to, which, he, had, been, consigned, critics, called, attention, to, the, fact, that, plays, such, as, ph, dre, could, be, interpreted, as, realist, drama, containing, characters, that, were, universal, and, that, could, appear, in, any, time, period, other, critics, cast, new, light, upon, the, underlying, themes, of, violence, and, scandal, that, seem, to, pervade, the, plays, creating, a, new, angle, from, which, they, could, be, examined, in, general, people, agreed, that, racine, would, only, be, fully, understood, when, removed, from, the, context, of, the, 18th, century, jean, yves, tadi, noted, that, marcel, proust, developed, a, fondness, for, racine, at, an, early, age, whom, he, considered, a, brother, and, someone, very, much, like, himself, in, his, essay, the, theatre, and, cruelty, antonin, artaud, claimed, that, the, misdeeds, of, the, psychological, theater, descended, from, racine, have, made, us, unaccustomed, to, that, immediate, and, violent, action, which, the, theater, should, possess, p, 84, at, present, racine, is, still, widely, considered, a, literary, genius, of, revolutionary, proportions, his, work, is, still, widely, read, and, frequently, performed, racine, s, influence, can, be, seen, in, a, s, byatt, s, tetralogy, the, virgin, in, the, garden, 1978, still, life, 1985, babel, tower, 1997, and, a, whistling, woman, 2002, byatt, tells, the, story, of, frederica, potter, an, english, young, woman, in, the, early, 1950s, when, she, is, first, introduced, who, is, very, appreciative, of, racine, and, specifically, of, phedre, the, linguistic, effects, of, racine, s, poetry, are, widely, considered, to, be, untranslatable, although, many, eminent, poets, have, attempted, to, translate, racine, s, work, into, english, including, lowell, richard, wilbur, ted, hughes, tony, harrison, and, derek, mahon, and, friedrich, schiller, german, and, monsignor, p, draig, de, br, n, into, the, irish, language, racine, s, plays, have, been, translated, into, english, by, robert, david, macdonald, alan, hollinghurst, berenice, bajazet, by, rada, director, edward, kemp, andromache, neil, bartlett, and, poet, geoffrey, alan, argent, who, earned, a,
