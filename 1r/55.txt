support, such, an, account, he, was, still, under, contract, with, the, studio, when, mgm, expressed, their, interest, in, the, actor, they, were, in, need, of, a, new, male, star, and, contacted,

in, the, five, years, he, was, with, fox, film, corporation, most, of, which, lost, money, at, the, box, office, in, the, 1930s, metro, goldwyn, mayer, was, the, most, respected, movie, production, studio, in, hollywood, when, tracy, arrived, there, he, was, all, but, unknown, biographer, james, curtis, writes, tracy, was, scarcely, a, blip, on, the, box, office, barometer, in, 1935, a, critics, darling, and, little, more, he, was, however, well, known, for, being, a, troublemaker, producer, irving, thalberg, was, nevertheless, enthusiastic, about, working, with, the, actor, telling, journalist, louella, parsons, spencer, tracy, will, become, one, of, mgm, s, most, valuable, stars, curtis, notes, that, the, studio, managed, tracy, with, care, a, welcome, change, from, the, ineptitude, and, apathy, he, had, known, while, at, fox, which, was, like, a, shot, of, adrenaline, for, the, actor, his, first, film, under, the, new, contract, was, the, quickly, produced, the, murder, man, 1935, which, included, the, feature, film, debut, of, james, stewart, thalberg, then, began, a, strategy, of, pairing, tracy, with, the, studio, s, top, actresses, whipsaw, 1935, co, starred, myrna, loy, and, was, a, commercial, success, riffraff, 1936, put, tracy, opposite, jean, harlow, both, films, were, however, designed, and, promoted, to, showcase, their, leading, ladies, thus, continuing, tracy, s, reputation, as, a, secondary, star, fury, 1936, was, the, first, film, to, prove, that, tracy, could, make, a, success, on, his, own, merit, directed, by, fritz, lang,

million, worldwide, curtis, writes, audiences, who, just, a, year, earlier, had, no, clear, handle, on, him, were, suddenly, turning, out, to, see, him, it, was, a, transition, that, was, nothing, short, of, miraculous, a, willingness, on, the, part, of, the, public, to, embrace, a, leading, man, who, was, not, textbook, handsome, nor, bigger, than, life, fury, was, followed, one, month, later, with, the, release, of, the, big, budget, disaster, movie, san, francisco, 1936, tracy, played, a, supporting, role, alongside, clark, gable, in, the, film, allowing, audiences, to, see, him, with, the, top, male, star, in, hollywood, taking, on, the, role, of, a, priest, tracy, reportedly, felt, a, heavy, responsibility, in, representing, the, church, despite, having, only, 17, minutes, of,

deschner, in, his, book, on, tracy, credits, fury, and, san, francisco, as, the, two, films, that, changed, his, career, and, gave, him, the, status, of, a, major, star, by, this, point, tracy, entered, a, period, of, self, imposed, sobriety, and, mgm, expressed, pleasure, with, tracy, s, professionalism, his, public, reputation, continued, to, grow, with, libeled, lady, also, 1936, a, screwball, comedy, that, cast, him, with, william, powell, loy, and, harlow, according, to, curtis, powell, harlow, and, loy, were, among, the, biggest, draws, in, the, industry, and, equal, billing, in, such, a, powerhouse, company, could, only, serve, to, advance, tracy, s, standing, libeled, lady, was, his, third, hit, picture, in, the, space, of, six, months, tracy, appeared, in, four, films, released, in, 1937, they, gave, him, a, gun, a, crime, drama, went, largely, unnoticed, but, captains, courageous, was, one, of, the, major, film, events, of, the, year, tracy, played, a, portuguese, fisherman, in, the, adventure, movie, based, on, the, novel, by, rudyard, kipling, he, was, uncomfortable, feigning, a, foreign, accent, and, resented, having, his, hair, curled, but, the, role, was, a, hit, with, audiences, and, tracy, won, the, academy, award, for, best, actor, captains, courageous, was, followed, by, big, city, with, luise, rainer, and, mannequin, with, joan, crawford, the,

another, enormous, commercial, and, critical, success, permanently, cementing, the, notion, of, gable, and, tracy, as, a, team, in, the, public, imagination, based, on, the, positive, response, he, had, received, in, san, francisco, mgm, again, cast, tracy, as, a, priest, in, boys, town, also, 1938, portraying, edward, j, flanagan, a, catholic, priest, and, founder, of, boys, town, in, nebraska,

performance, and, the, movie, grossed, 4, million, worldwide, for, the, second, year, running, tracy, received, an, academy, award, for, best, actor, he, was, humble, about, the, recognition, saying, in, his, acceptance, speech, i, honestly, do, not, feel, that, i, can, accept, this, award, i, can, accept, it, only, as, it, was, meant, to, be, for, a, great, man, father, flanagan, although, he,

tribune, was, not, charmed, by, the, story, but, wrote, that, tracy, by, sheer, persuasion, of, his, acting, made, the, film, worthy, boom, town, was, the, third, and, final, gable, tracy, picture, also, starring, claudette, colbert, and, hedy, lamarr, making, it, one, of, the, most, anticipated, films, of, the, year, the, film, opened, to, the, biggest, crowd, since, gone, with, the, wind,
