credit, for, on, the, town, according, to, kelly, when, you, are, involved, in, doing, choreography, for, film, you, must, have, expert, assistants, i, needed, one, to, watch, my, performance, and, one, to, work, with, the, cameraman, on, the, timing, without, such, people, as, stanley, carol, haney, and, jeanne, coyne, i, could, never, have, done, these, things, when, we, came, to, do, on, the, town, i, knew, it, was, time, for, stanley, to, get, screen, credit, because, we, weren, t, boss, assistant, anymore, but, co, creators, together, they, opened, up, the, musical, form, taking, the,

of, all, film, musicals, singin, in, the, rain, 1952, as, co, director, lead, star, and, choreographer, kelly, was, the, driving, force, in, both, of, these, films, johnny, green, the, head, of,

loves, hard, work, if, you, want, to, play, on, his, team, you, d, better, like, hard, work, too, he, isn, t, cruel, but, he, is, tough, and, if, gene, believed, in, something, he, didn, t, care, who, he, was, talking, to, whether, it, was, louis, b, mayer, or, the, gatekeeper, he, wasn, t, awed, by, anybody, and, he, had, a, good, record, of, getting, what, he, wanted, an, american, in, paris,

with, donald, o, connor, and, the, broadway, melody, finale, with, cyd, charisse, though, the, film, did, not, initially, generate, the, same, enthusiasm, an, american, in, paris, created, it, has, subsequently, overtaken, the, earlier, film, to, occupy, its, current, pre, eminent, place, in, the, esteem, of, critics, at, the, peak, of, his, creative, powers, kelly, made, what, in, retrospect, some, see, as, a, career, mistake, in, december, 1951, he, signed, a, contract, with, mgm, that, sent, him, to, europe, for, 19, months, to, use, mgm, funds, frozen, in, europe, to, make, three,

with, the, widescreen, possibilities, of, cinemascope, mgm, had, lost, faith, in, kelly, s, box, office, appeal, and, as, a, result, it, s, always, fair, weather, premiered, at, 17, drive, in,

entertainment, part, ii, 1976, it, was, a, measure, of, his, powers, of, persuasion, that, he, managed, to, coax, the, 77, year, old, astaire, who, had, insisted, that, his, contract, rule, out, any, dancing, having, long, since, retired, into, performing, a, series, of, song, and, dance, duets, evoking, a, powerful, nostalgia, for, the, glory, days, of, the, american, musical, film, kelly, was,

john, in, kelly, s, opinion, the, concept, was, marvelous, but, it, just, didn, t, come, off, in, the, same, year, he, was, invited, by, francis, ford, coppola, to, recruit, a, production, staff, for, american, zoetrope, s, one, from, the, heart, 1982, although, coppola, s, ambition, was, for, him, to, establish, a, production, unit, to, rival, the, freed, unit, at, mgm, the, film, s, failure, put,

entertainment, iii, 1994, his, final, film, project, was, the, animated, film, cats, don, t, dance, not, released, until, 1997, for, which, kelly, acted, as, an, uncredited, choreographic, consultant, it, was, dedicated, to, his, memory, when, he, began, his, collaborative, film, work, he, was, influenced, by, robert, alton, and, john, murray, anderson, striving, to, create, moods, and, character, insight, with, his, dances, he, choreographed, his, own, movement, along, with, that, of, the, ensemble, with, the, assistance, of, jeanne, coyne, stanley, donen, carol, haney, and, alex, romero, he, experimented, with, lighting, camera, techniques, and, special, effects, to, achieve, true, integration, of, dance, with, film, and, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, split, screens, double, images, and, live, action, with, animation, and, is, credited, as, the, person, who, made, the, ballet, form, commercially, acceptable, to, film, audiences, a, clear, progression, was, evident, in, his, development, from, an, early, concentration, on, tap, and, musical, comedy, style, to, greater, complexity, using, ballet, and, modern, dance, forms, kelly, himself, refused, to, categorize, his, style, i, don, t, have, a, name, for, my, style, of, dancing, it, s, certainly, hybrid, i, ve, borrowed, from, the, modern, dance, from, the, classical, and, certainly, from, the, american, folk, dance, tap, dancing, jitterbugging, but, i, have, tried, to, develop, a, style, which, is, indigenous, to, the, environment, in, which, i, was, reared, he, especially, acknowledged, the, influence, of, george, m, cohan, i, have, a, lot, of, cohan, in, me, it, s, an, irish, quality, a, jaw, jutting, up, on, the, toes, cockiness, which, is, a, good, quality, for, a, male, dancer, to, have, he, was, also, heavily, influenced, by, an, african, american, dancer, robert, dotson, whom, he, saw, perform, at, loew, s, penn, theatre, around, 1929, he, was, briefly, taught, by, frank, harrington, an, african, american, tap, specialist, from, new, york, however, his, main, interest, was, in, ballet, which, he, studied, under, kotchetovsky, in, the, early, 1930s, biographer, clive, hirschhorn, writes, as, a, child, he, used, to, run, for, miles, through, parks, and, streets, and, woods, anywhere, just, as, long, as, he, could, feel, the, wind, against, his, body, and, through, his, hair, ballet, gave, him, the, same, feeling, of, exhilaration, and, in, 1933, he, was, convinced, it, was, the, most, satisfying, form, of, self, expression, he, also, studied, spanish, dancing, under, angel, cansino, rita, hayworth, s, uncle, generally, speaking, he, tended, to, use, tap, and, other, popular, dance, idioms, to, express, joy, and, exuberance, as, in, the, title, song, for, singin, in, the, rain, or, i, got, rhythm, in, an, american, in, paris, whereas, pensive, or, romantic, feelings, were, more, often, expressed, via, ballet, or, modern, dance, as, in, heather, on, the, hill, from, brigadoon, or, our, love, is, here, to, stay, from, an, american, in, paris, according, to, delamater, kelly, s, work, seems, to, represent, the, fulfillment, of, dance, film, integration, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, while, fred, astaire, had, revolutionized, the, filming, of, dance, in, the, 1930s, by, insisting, on, full, figure, photography, of, dancers, while, allowing, only, a, modest, degree, of, camera, movement, kelly, freed, up, the, camera, making, greater, use, of, space, camera, movement, camera, angles, and, editing, creating, a, partnership, between, dance, movement, and, camera, movement, without, sacrificing, full, figure, framing, kelly, s, reasoning, behind, this, was, that, he, felt, the, kinetic, force, of, live, dance, often, evaporated, when, brought, to, film, and, he, sought, to, partially, overcome, this, by, involving, the, camera, in, movement, and, giving, the, dancer, a, greater, number, of, directions, in, which, to, move, examples, of, this, abound, in, kelly, s, work, and, are, well, illustrated, in, the, prehistoric, man, sequence, from, on, the, town, and, the, hat, my, father, wore, on, st, patrick, s, day, from, take, me, out, to, the, ball, game, in, 1951, he, summed, up, his, vision, as, if, the, camera, is, to, make, a, contribution, at, all, to, dance, this, must, be, the, focal, point, of, its, contribution, the, fluid, background, giving, each, spectator, an, undistorted, and, altogether, similar, view, of, dancer, and, background, to, accomplish, this, the, camera, is, made, fluid, moving, with, the, dancer, so, that, the, lens, becomes, the, eye, of, the, spectator, your, eye, kelly, s, athleticism, gave, his, moves, a, distinctive, broad, muscular, quality, and, this, was, a, deliberate, choice, on, his, part, as, he, explained, there, s, a, strong, link, between, sports, and, dancing, and, my, own, dancing, springs, from, my, early, days, as, an, athlete, i, think, dancing, is, a, man, s, game, and, if, he, does, it, well, he, does, it, better, than, a, woman, caron, said, that, while, dancing, with, astaire, she, felt, like, she, was, floating, kelly, danced, close, to, the, ground, he, railed, against, what, he, saw, as, the, widespread, effeminacy, in, male, dancing, which, in, his, opinion, tragically, stigmatized, the, genre, alienating, boys, from, entering, the, field, dancing, does, attract, effeminate, young, men, i, don, t, object, to, that, as, long, as, they, don, t, dance, effeminately, i, just, say, that, if, a, man, dances, effeminately, he, dances, badly, just, as, if, a, woman, comes, out, on, stage, and, starts, to, sing, bass, unfortunately, people, confuse, gracefulness, with, softness, john, wayne, is, a, graceful, man, and, so, are, some, of, the, great, ballplayers, but, of, course, they, don, t, run, the, risk, of, being, called, sissies, in, his, view, one, of, our, problems, is, that, so, much, dancing, is, taught, by, women, you, can, spot, many, male, dancers, who, have, this, tuition, by, their, arm, movements, they, are, soft, limp, and, feminine, he, acknowledged, that, in, spite, of, his, efforts, in, tv, programs, such, as, dancing, a, man, s, game, 1958, for, example, the, situation, changed, little, over, the, years, he, also, sought, to, break, from, the, class, conscious, conventions, of, the, 1930s, and, early, 40s, when, top, hat, and, tails, or, tuxedos, were, the, norm, by, dancing, in, casual, or, everyday, work, clothes, so, as, to, make, his, dancing, more, relevant, to, the, cinema, going, public, his, first, wife, actress, and, dancer, betsy, blair, said, a, sailor, suit, or, his, white, socks, and, loafers, or, the, t, shirts, on, his, muscular, torso, gave, everyone, the, feeling, that, he, was, a, regular, guy, and, perhaps, they, too, could, express, love, and, joy, by, dancing, in, the, street, or, stomping, through, puddles, he, democratized, the, dance, in, movies, in, particular, he, wanted, to, create, a, completely, different, image, from, that, associated, with, fred, astaire, not, least, because, he, believed, his, physique, did, not, suit, such, refined, elegance, i, used, to, envy, his, cool, aristocratic, style, so, intimate, and, contained, fred, wears, top, hat, and, tails, to, the, manor, born, i, put, them, on, and, look, like, a, truck, driver, from, the, mid, 1940s, through, the, early, 1950s, his, wife, betsy, blair, and, he, organized, weekly, parties, at, their, beverly, hills, home, and, they, often, played, an, intensely, competitive, and, physical, version, of, charades, known, as, the, game, his, papers, are, housed, at, the, howard, gotlieb, archival, research, center, at, boston, university, late, in, life, kelly, was, awarded, irish, citizenship, under, ireland, s, citizenship, by, foreign, birth, program, the, application, was, initiated, on, his, behalf, by, his, wife, patricia, ward, kelly, on, december, 22, 1983, the, actor, s, beverly, hills, mansion, burned, down, faulty, christmas, tree, wiring, was, blamed, his, family, and, pets, escaped, and, he, suffered, a, burned, hand, kelly, married, three, times, his, first, marriage, was, to, actress, betsy, blair, in, 1941, they, had, one, child, kerry, b, 1942, and, divorced, in, april, 1957, in, 1960, kelly, married, his, choreographic, assistant, jeanne, coyne, who, had, previously, been, married, to, stanley, donen, between, 1948, and, 1951, kelly, and, coyne, had, two, children, timothy, b, 1962, and, bridget, b, 1964, this, marriage, lasted, until, coyne, died, in, 1973, kelly, married, patricia, ward, in, 1990, when, he, was, 77, and, she, was, 30, their, marriage, lasted, until, his, death, six, years, later, and, she, has, never, remarried, kelly, was, a, lifelong, supporter, of, the, democratic, party, his, period, of, greatest, prominence, coincided, with, the, mccarthy, era, in, the, us, in, 1947, he, was, part, of, the, committee, for, the, first, amendment, the, hollywood, delegation, that, flew, to, washington, to, protest, at, the, first, official, hearings, by, the, house, committee, on, un, american, activities, his, first, wife, betsy, blair, was, suspected, of, being, a, communist, sympathizer, and, when, united, artists, which, had, offered, blair, a, part, in, marty, 1955, were, considering, withdrawing, her, under, pressure, from, the, american, legion, kelly, successfully, threatened, mgm, s, influence, on, united, artists, with, a, pullout, from, it, s, always, fair, weather, unless, his, wife, was, restored, to, the, part, he, used, his, position, on, the, board, of, directors, of, the, writers, guild, of, america, west, on, a, number, of, occasions, to, mediate, disputes, between, unions, and, the, hollywood, studios, he, was, raised, as, a, roman, catholic, and, was, a, member, of, the, good, shepherd, parish, and, the, catholic, motion, picture, guild, in, beverly, hills, california, however, after, becoming, disenchanted, by, the, roman, catholic, church, s, support, for, francisco, franco, against, the, second, spanish, republic, during, the, spanish, civil, war, he, officially, severed, his, ties, with, the, church, in, september, 1939, this, separation, was, prompted, in, part, by, a, trip, kelly, made, to, mexico, in, which, he, became, convinced, that, the, church, had, failed, to, help, the, poor, in, that, country, after, his, departure, from, the, catholic, church, kelly, became, an, agnostic, as, he, had, previously, described, himself, kelly, s, health, declined, steadily, in, the,
