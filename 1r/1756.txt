credited, with, inventing, some, of, the, world, s, earliest, naval, torpedoes, for, use, by, the, royal, navy, fulton, became, interested, in, steam, engines, and, the, idea, of, steamboats, in, 1777, when, he, was, around, age, 12, and, visited, state, delegate, william, henry, of, lancaster, pennsylvania, who, was, interested, in, this, topic, henry, had, learned, about, inventor, james,

and, family, into, it, in, early, 1786, fulton, developed, symptoms, of, tuberculosis, and, was, advised, by, an, eminent, doctor, to, take, an, ocean, voyage, for, the, benefit, of, his, health, fulton, traveled, to, europe, where, he, would, live, for, the, next, twenty, years, he, left, for, england, in, the, autumn, of, 1786, carrying, several, letters, of, introduction, to, americans, abroad, from, prominent, individuals, he, had, met, in, philadelphia, he, already, corresponded, with, artist, benjamin, west, their, fathers, had, been, close, friends, west, took, fulton, into, his, home, where, fulton, lived, for, several, years, and, studied, painting, fulton, gained, many, commissions, painting, portraits, and, landscapes, which, allowed, him, to, support, himself, he, continued, to, experiment, with, mechanical, inventions, fulton, became, caught, up, in, the, enthusiasm, of, the, canal, mania, in, 1793, he, began, developing, his, ideas, for, tugboat, canals, with, inclined, planes, instead, of, locks, he, obtained, a, patent, for, this, idea, in, 1794, and, also, began, working, on, ideas, for, the, steam, power, of, boats, he, published, a, pamphlet, about, canals, and, patented, a, dredging, machine, and, several, other, inventions, in, 1794, he, moved, to, manchester, to, gain, practical, knowledge, of, english, canal, engineering, while, there, he, became, friendly, with, robert, owen, a, cotton, manufacturer, and, early, socialist, owen, agreed, to, finance, the, development, and, promotion, of, fulton, s, designs, for, inclined, planes, and, earth, digging, machines, he, was, instrumental, in, introducing, the, american, to, a, canal, company, which, awarded, him, a, sub, contract, but, fulton, was, not, successful, at, this, practical, effort, and, he, gave, up, the, contract, after, a, short, time, as, early, as, 1793, fulton, proposed, plans, for, steam, powered, vessels, to, both, the, united, states, and, british, governments, the, first, steamships, had, appeared, considerably, earlier, the, earliest, steam, powered, ship, in, which, the, engine, moved, oars, was, built, by, claude, de, jouffroy, in, france, called, palmip, de, it, was, tested, on, the, doubs, in, 1776, in, 1783, de, jouffroy, built, pyroscaphe, the, first, paddle, steamer, which, sailed, successfully, on, the, sa, ne, the, first, successful, trial, run, of, a, steamboat, in, america, had, been, made, by, inventor, john, fitch, on, the, delaware, river, on, august, 22, 1787, william, symington, had, successfully, tried, steamboats, in, 1788, and, it, seems, probable, that, fulton, was, aware, of, these, developments, in, britain, fulton, met, the, duke, of, bridgewater, francis, egerton, whose, canal, the, first, to, be, constructed, in, the, country, was, being, used, for, trials, of, a, steam, tug, fulton, became, very, enthusiastic, about, the, canals, and, wrote, a, 1796, treatise, on, canal, construction, suggesting, improvements, to, locks, and, other, features, working, for, the, duke, of, bridgewater, between, 1796, and, 1799, fulton, had, a, boat, constructed, in, the, duke, s, timber, yard, under, the, supervision, of, benjamin, powell, after, installation, of, the, machinery, supplied, by, the, engineers, bateman, and, sherratt, of, salford, the, boat, was, duly, christened, bonaparte, in, honour, of, fulton, having, served, under, napoleon, after, expensive, trials, because, of, the, configuration, of, the, design, the, team, feared, the, paddles, might, damage, the, clay, lining, of, the, canal, and, eventually, abandoned, the, experiment, in, 1801, bridgewater, instead, ordered, eight, vessels, for, his, canal, based, on, charlotte, dundas, constructed, by, symington, in, 1797, fulton, went, to, paris, where, he, was, well, known, as, an, inventor, he, studied, french, and, german, along, with, mathematics, and, chemistry, fulton, also, exhibited, the, first, panorama, painting, to, be, shown, in, paris, pierre, pr, vost, s, vue, de, paris, depuis, les, tuileries, 1800, on, what, is, still, called, rue, des, panoramas, panorama, street, today, while, living, in, france, fulton, designed, the, first, working, muscle, powered, submarine, nautilus, between, 1793, and, 1797, he, also, experimented, with, torpedoes, when, tested, his, submarine, operated, underwater, for, 17, minutes, in, 25, feet, of, water, he, asked, the, government, to, subsidize, its, construction, but, he, was, turned, down, twice, eventually, he, approached, the, minister, of, marine, and, in, 1800, was, granted, permission, to, build, the, shipyard, perrier, in, rouen, built, it, and, the, submarine, sailed, first, in, july, 1800, on, the, seine, river, in, the, same, city, in, france, fulton, met, robert, r, livingston, who, was, appointed, u, s, ambassador, to, france, in, 1801, he, also, had, a, scientifically, curious, mind, and, the, two, men, decided, to, collaborate, on, building, a, steamboat, and, to, try, operating, it, on, the, seine, fulton, experimented, with, the, water, resistance, of, various, hull, shapes, made, drawings, and, models, and, had, a, steamboat, constructed, at, the, first, trial, the, boat, ran, perfectly, but, the, hull, was, later, rebuilt, and, strengthened, on, august, 9, 1803, when, this, boat, was, driven, up, the, river, seine, it, sank, the, boat, was, 66, feet, 20, m, long, with, an, 8, foot, 2, 4, m, beam, and, made, between, 2, 1, 2, and, 3, 1, 2, knots, 5, and, 6, km, h, against, the, current, in, 1804, fulton, switched, allegiance, and, moved, to, britain, where, he, was, commissioned, by, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, to, build, a, range, of, weapons, for, use, by, the, royal, navy, during, napoleon, s, invasion, scares, among, his, inventions, were, the, world, s, first, modern, naval, torpedoes, modern, mines, these, were, tested, along, with, several, other, of, his, inventions, during, the, 1804, raid, on, boulogne, but, met, with, limited, success, although, fulton, continued, to, develop, his, inventions, with, the, british, until, 1806, the, crushing, naval, victory, by, admiral, horatio, nelson, at, the, 1805, battle, of, trafalgar, greatly, reduced, the, risk, of, french, invasion, fulton, was, increasingly, sidelined, as, a, result, in, 1806, fulton, returned, to, the, united, states, in, 1807, he, and, robert, r, livingston, built, the, first, commercially, successful, steamboat, north, river, steamboat, later, known, as, clermont, livingston, s, shipping, company, began, using, it, to, carry, passengers, between, new, york, city, and, up, the, hudson, river, to, the, state, capital, albany, clermont, made, the, 150, nautical, mile, 280, km,

union, nurse, on, a, steamboat, hospital, in, the, american, civil, war, the, clermont, was, the, first, successful, steamboat, in, america, while, it, was, being, built, people, called, it, fulton, s, folly, the, clermont, had, sails, as, well, as, a, steam, engine, at, each, end, of, the, boat, was, a, short, mast, with, a, small, square, sail, that, could, be, unfurled, when, needed, the, engine, was, in, the, center, of, the, boat, and, was, surrounded, by, cord, wood, the, engine, was, 24, horsepower, above, the, engine, was, a, tall, and, slender, smoke, stack, on, each, side, was, a, big, paddle, wheel, that, was, open, and, uncovered, the, diameter, of, the, paddle, wheels, was, 15, feet, 4, 6, m, the, boat, itself, was, 136, feet, 41, m, long, and, 18, feet, 5, 5, m, wide, its, displacement, was, 160, tons, fulton, received, two, patents, for, his, steamboat, one, in, 1809, and, the, other, in, 1811, from, 1811, until, his, death, fulton, was, a, member, of, the, erie,
