ptolemy, i, soter, t, l, m, i, greek, ptolema, os, s, t, r, ptolemy, the, savior, c, 367, bc, january, 282, bc, was, a, macedonian, greek, general, historian, and, successor, of, alexander, the, great, who, went, on, to, found, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, centered, on, egypt, ptolemy, was, basileus, and, pharaoh, of, ptolemaic, egypt, from, 305, 304, bc, to, his, death, in, 282, bc, and, his, descendants, continued, to, rule, egypt, until, 30, bc, during, their, rule, egypt, became, a, thriving, bastion, of, hellenistic, civilization, and, alexandria, a, great, seat, of, greek, culture, ptolemy, i, was, the, son, of, arsinoe, of, macedon, by, either, her, husband, lagus, or, philip, ii, of, macedon, the, father, of, alexander, however, the, latter, is, unlikely, and, may, be, a, myth, fabricated, to, glorify, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, ptolemy, was, one, of, alexander, s, most, trusted, companions, and, military, officers, after, the, death, of, alexander, in, 323, bc, ptolemy, retrieved, his, body, as, it, was, en, route, to, be, buried, in, macedon, placing, it, in, memphis, instead, where, it, was, later, moved, to, alexandria, in, a, new, tomb, afterwards, he, joined, a, coalition, against, perdiccas, the, royal, regent, over, philip, iii, of, macedon, the, latter, invaded, egypt, but, was, assassinated, by, his, own, officers, in, 320, bc, allowing, ptolemy, i, to, consolidate, his, control, over, the, country, after, a, series, of, wars, between, alexander, s, successors, ptolemy, gained, a, claim, to, judea, in, southern, syria, which, was, disputed, with, the, seleucid, king, seleucus, i, he, also, took, control, of, cyprus, and, cyrenaica, the, latter, of, which, was, placed, under, the, control, of, ptolemy, s, stepson, magas, ptolemy, also, had, the, library, of, alexandria, built, ptolemy, i, may, have, married, tha, s, his, mistress, during, the, life, of, alexander, he, is, known, to, have, married, the, persian, noblewoman, artakama, on, alexander, s, orders, he, later, married, eurydice, daughter, of, the, macedonian, regent, antipater, their, sons, ptolemy, keraunos, and, meleager, ruled, in, turn, as, kings, of, macedon, ptolemy, s, final, marriage, was, to, eurydice, s, cousin, and, lady, in, waiting, berenice, i, upon, his, death, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, with, berenice, ptolemy, ii, ptolemy, was, a, macedonian, born, in, 367, bc, his, mother, was, arsinoe, according, to, satyrus, the, peripatetic, arsinoe, was, a, descendant, of, alexander, i, of, macedon, and, thus, a, member, of, the, argead, dynasty, claiming, ultimate, descent, from, heracles, ostensibly, ptolemy, s, father, was, lagus, a, macedonian, nobleman, from, eordaea, but, many, ancient, sources, claim, that, he, was, actually, an, illegitimate, son, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, if, true, this, would, have, made, ptolemy, the, half, brother, of, alexander, the, great, it, is, probable, that, this, is, a, later, myth, fabricated, to, glorify, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, however, through, his, mother, ptolemy, may, have, been, a, great, grandson, of, amyntas, i, of, macedon, making, him, a, member, of, the, argead, royal, house, and, a, distant, relative, of, alexander, who, was, a, great, great, grandson, of, amyntas, ptolemy, served, with, alexander, from, his, first, campaigns, and, was, among, the, seven, somatophylakes, bodyguards, of, alexander, he, played, a, principal, part, in, the, later, campaigns, in, afghanistan, and, india, he, participated, in, the, battle, of, issus, commanding, troops, on, the, left, wing, under, the, authority, of, parmenion, later, he, accompanied, alexander, during, his, journey, to, the, oracle, in, the, siwa, oasis, where, he, was, proclaimed, a, son, of, zeus, ptolemy, had, his, first, independent, command, during, the, campaign, against, the, rebel, bessus, whom, his, own, guards, captured, and, handed, over, to, ptolemy, who, then, handed, him, over, to, alexander, for, execution, when, alexander, died, in, 323, bc, ptolemy, is, said, to, have, instigated, the, settlement, of, the, empire, made, at, babylon, through, the, partition, of, babylon, he, was, appointed, satrap, of, egypt, under, the, nominal, kings, philip, iii, and, the, infant, alexander, iv, the, former, satrap, the, greek, cleomenes, stayed, on, as, his, deputy, ptolemy, quickly, moved, without, authorization, to, subjugate, cyrenaica, by, custom, kings, in, macedonia, asserted, their, right, to, the, throne, by, burying, their, predecessor, probably, because, he, wanted, to, pre, empt, perdiccas, the, imperial, regent, from, staking, his, claim, in, this, way, ptolemy, took, great, pains, in, acquiring, the, body, of, alexander, the, great, on, his, deathbed, alexander, wished, to, be, buried, at, the, temple, of, zeus, ammon, in, the, siwa, oasis, of, ancient, libya, instead, of, the, royal, tombs, of, aigai, in, macedon, however, his, successors, including, perdiccas, attempted, to, bury, his, body, in, macedon, instead, in, late, 322, or, early, 321, bc, alexander, s, body, was, in, syria, on, its, way, to, macedon, when, it, was, captured, by, ptolemy, i, he, brought, alexander, s, remains, back, to, egypt, interring, them, at, memphis, but, they, were, later, moved, to, alexandria, where, a, tomb, was, constructed, for, them, shortly, after, this, event, ptolemy, openly, joined, the, coalition, against, perdiccas, perdiccas, appears, to, have, suspected, ptolemy, of, aiming, for, the, throne, himself, and, may, have, decided, that, ptolemy, was, his, most, dangerous, rival, ptolemy, executed, cleomenes, for, spying, on, behalf, of, perdiccas, this, removed, the, chief, check, on, his, authority, and, allowed, ptolemy, to, obtain, the, huge, sum, that, cleomenes, had, accumulated, in, 321, bc, perdiccas, attempted, to, invade, egypt, only, to, fall, at, the, hands, of, his, own, men, ptolemy, s, decision, to, defend, the, nile, against, perdiccas, ended, in, fiasco, for, perdiccas, with, the, loss, of, 2, 000, men, this, failure, was, a, fatal, blow, to, perdiccas, reputation, and, he, was, murdered, in, his, tent, by, two, of, his, subordinates, ptolemy, immediately, crossed, the, nile, to, provide, supplies, to, what, had, the, day, before, been, an, enemy, army, ptolemy, was, offered, the, regency, in, place, of, perdiccas, but, he, declined, ptolemy, was, consistent, in, his, policy, of, securing, a, power, base, while, never, succumbing, to, the, temptation, of, risking, all, to, succeed, alexander, in, the, long, wars, that, followed, between, the, different, diadochi, ptolemy, s, first, goal, was, to, hold, egypt, securely, and, his, second, was, to, secure, control, in, the, outlying, areas, cyrenaica, and, cyprus, as, well, as, syria, including, the, province, of, judea, his, first, occupation, of, syria, was, in, 318, and, he, established, at, the, same, time, a, protectorate, over, the, petty, kings, of, cyprus, when, antigonus, i, master, of, asia, in, 315, showed, expansionist, ambitions, ptolemy, joined, the, coalition, against, him, and, on, the, outbreak, of, war, evacuated, syria, in, cyprus, he, fought, the, partisans, of, antigonus, and, re, conquered, the, island, 313, a, revolt, in, cyrene, was, crushed, the, same, year, in, 312, ptolemy, and, seleucus, the, fugitive, satrap, of, babylonia, both, invaded, syria, and, defeated, demetrius, i, the, son, of, antigonus, in, the, battle, of, gaza, again, he, occupied, syria, and, again, after, only, a, few, months, when, demetrius, had, won, a, battle, over, his, general, and, antigonus, entered, syria, in, force, he, evacuated, it, in, 311, a, peace, was, concluded, between, the, combatants, soon, after, this, the, surviving, 13, year, old, king, alexander, iv, was, murdered, in, macedonia, on, the, orders, of, cassander, leaving, the, satrap, of, egypt, absolutely, his, own, master, the, peace, did, not, last, long, early, in, 310, he, was, informed, that, his, ally, nicocles, of, paphos, was, planning, to, defect, to, antigonus, he, sent, some, agents, who, together, with, his, brother, menelaus, who, was, still, on, cyprus, with, an, army, dealt, with, the, situation, they, surrounded, nicocles, palace, and, forced, him, to, commit, suicide, in, 309, ptolemy, personally, commanded, a, fleet, which, detached, the, coastal, towns, of, phaselis, xanthos, kaunos, iasos, and, myndus, in, lycia, and, caria, from, antigonus, then, crossed, into, greece, where, he, took, possession, of, corinth, sicyon, and, megara, 308, bc, in, 306, a, great, fleet, under, demetrius, attacked, cyprus, and, ptolemy, s, brother, menelaus, was, defeated, and, captured, in, another, decisive, battle, of, salamis, ptolemy, s, complete, loss, of, cyprus, followed, the, satraps, antigonus, and, demetrius, now, each, assumed, the, title, of, king, ptolemy, as, well, as, cassander, lysimachus, and, seleucus, i, nicator, responded, by, doing, the, same, in, the, winter, of, 306, bc, antigonus, tried, to, follow, up, his, victory, in, cyprus, by, invading, egypt, but, ptolemy, was, strongest, there, and, successfully, held, the, frontier, against, him, ptolemy, led, no, further, overseas, expeditions, against, antigonus, however, he, did, send, great, assistance, to, rhodes, when, it, was, besieged, by, demetrius, 305, 304, the, rhodians, granted, divine, honors, to, ptolemy, as, a, result, of, the, lifting, of, the, siege, when, the, coalition, against, antigonus, was, renewed, in, 302, ptolemy, joined, it, and, invaded, syria, a, third, time, while, antigonus, was, engaged, with, lysimachus, in, asia, minor, on, hearing, a, report, that, antigonus, had, won, a, decisive, victory, there, he, once, again, evacuated, syria, but, when, the, news, came, that, antigonus, had, been, defeated, and, slain, by, lysimachus, and, seleucus, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, he, occupied, syria, a, fourth, time, the, other, members, of, the, coalition, had, assigned, all, syria, to, seleucus, after, what, they, regarded, as, ptolemy, s, desertion, and, for, the, next, hundred, years, the, question, of, the, ownership, of, southern, syria, i, e, judea, produced, recurring, warfare, between, the, seleucid, and, ptolemaic, dynasties, henceforth, ptolemy, seems, to, have, involved, himself, as, little, as, possible, in, the, rivalries, between, asia, minor, and, greece, he, lost, what, he, held, in, greece, but, reconquered, cyprus, in, 295, 294, cyrenaica, after, a, series, of, rebellions, was, finally, subjugated, in, about, 300, and, placed, under, his, stepson, magas, while, alexander, was, alive, ptolemy, had, three, children, with, his, mistress, tha, s, who, may, also, have, been, his, wife, lagus, leontiscus, and, eirene, who, was, given, in, marriage, to, eunostos, of, soloi, in, cyprus, during, the, susa, weddings, ptolemy, married, persian, noblewoman, artakama, as, ordered, by, alexander, the, great, around, 322, bc, he, married, eurydice, daughter, of, antipater, regent, of, macedonia, they, had, five, children, before, she, was, repudiated, three, sons, ptolemy, ceraunus, king, of, macedon, from, 281, bc, to, 279, bc, his, brother, and, successor, meleager, who, ruled, for, two, months, in, 279, bc, and, a, rebel, in, cyprus, who, was, put, to, death, by, his, half, brother, ptolemy, ii, as, well, as, the, daughters, ptolemais, who, married, demetrius, i, of, macedon, and, lysandra, first, married, to, alexander, v, of, macedon, and, after, to, lysimachus, son, agathocles, ptolemy, married, once, more, to, berenice, eurydice, s, cousin, who, had, come, to, egypt, as, eurydice, s, lady, in, waiting, with, the, children, from, her, first, marriage, to, philip, their, children, were, arsinoe, ii, philotera, and, ptolemy, ii, their, eldest, child, arsinoe, married, lysimachus, then, her, half, brother, ptolemy, keraunos, and, finally, her, full, brother, ptolemy, ii, in, 285, ptolemy, made, his, son, ptolemy, ii, his, co, regent, his, eldest, legitimate, son, ptolemy, keraunos, fled, to, the, court, of, lysimachus, ptolemy, i, died, in, january, 282, aged, 84, or, 85, shrewd, and, cautious, he, had, a, compact, and, well, ordered, realm, to, show, at, the, end, of, forty, years, of, war, his, reputation, for, good, nature, and, liberality, attached, the, floating, soldier, class, of, macedonians, and, other, greeks, to, his, service, and, was, not, insignificant, nor, did, he, wholly, neglect, conciliation, of, the, natives, he, was, a, ready, patron, of, letters, founding, the, great, library, of, alexandria, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, which, he, founded, ruled, egypt, for, nearly, three, hundred, years, it, was, a, hellenistic, kingdom, known, for, its, capital, alexandria, which, became, a, center, of, greek, culture, ptolemaic, rule, ended, with, the, death, of, cleopatra, vii, in, 30, bc, ptolemy, himself, wrote, an, eyewitness, history, of, alexander, s, campaigns, now, lost, in, the, second, century, ad, ptolemy, s, history, was, used, by, arrian, of, nicomedia, as, one, of, his, two, main, primary, sources, alongside, the, history, of, aristobulus, of, cassandreia, for, his, own, extant, anabasis, of, alexander, and, hence, large, parts, of, ptolemy, s, history, can, be, assumed, to, survive, in, paraphrase, or, pr, cis, in, arrian, s, work, arrian, cites, ptolemy, by, name, on, only, a, few, occasions, but, it, is, likely, that, large, stretches, of, arrian, s, anabasis, reflect, ptolemy, s, version, of, events, arrian, once, names, ptolemy, as, the, author, whom, i, chiefly, follow, and, in, his, preface, writes, that, ptolemy, seemed, to, him, to, be, a, particularly, trustworthy, source, not, only, because, he, was, present, with, alexander, on, campaign, but, also, because, he, was, himself, a, king, and, hence, lying, would, be, more, dishonourable, for, him, than, for, anyone, else, ptolemy, s, lost, history, was, long, considered, an, objective, work, distinguished, by, its, straightforward, honesty, and, sobriety, but, more, recent, work, has, called, this, assessment, into, question, r, m, errington, argued, that, ptolemy, s, history, was, characterised, by, persistent, bias, and, self, aggrandisement, and, by, systematic, blackening, of, the, reputation, of, perdiccas, one, of, ptolemy, s, chief, dynastic, rivals, after, alexander, s, death, for, example, arrian, s, account, of, the, fall, of, thebes, in, 335, bc, anabasis, 1, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, a, rare, section, of, narrative, explicitly, attributed, to, ptolemy, by, arrian, shows, several, significant, variations, from, the, parallel, account, preserved, in, diodorus, siculus, 17, 11, 12, most, notably, in, attributing, a, distinctly, unheroic, role, in, proceedings, to, perdiccas, more, recently, j, roisman, has, argued, that, the, case, for, ptolemy, s, blackening, of, perdiccas, and, others, has, been, much, exaggerated, ptolemy, personally, sponsored, the, great, mathematician, euclid, he, found, euclid, s, seminal, work, the, elements, too, difficult, to, study, so, he, asked, if, there, were, an, easier, way, to, master, it, according, to, proclus, euclid, famously, quipped, sire, there, is, no, royal, road, to, geometry
