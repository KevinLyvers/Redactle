infanta, isabella, clara, eugenia, of, spain, the, sovereigns, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, van, veen, instilled, in, rubens, the, ideal, of, the, pictor, doctus, learned, painter, who, understands, that, painting, requires, not, only, practice, but, also, on, knowledge, of, art, theory, classical, art, and, literature, and, the, masters, of, the, italian, renaissance, he, also, introduced, rubens, to, the, code, of, conduct, which, court, painters, needed, to, respect, to, become, successful, rubens, completed, his, apprenticeship, with, van, veen, in, 1598, the, year, he,

period, such, as, the, adam, and, eve, rubenshuis, antwerp, c, 1599, and, the, battle, of, the, amazons, bildergalerie, potsdam, sanssouci, show, the, influence, of, his, master, van, veen, this,

coincided, with, that, of, duke, vincenzo, i, gonzaga, of, mantua, it, is, possible, that, he, was, hired, by, the, duke, during, his, stay, in, venice, or, that, otto, van, veen, who, was, court, painter, to, archdukes, albert, and, isabella, joint, governors, of, flanders, had, introduced, rubens, to, the, duke, during, the, latter, s, visit, to, the, brussels, court, the, small, duchy, of,

returned, home, during, this, first, stay, in, rome, rubens, completed, his, first, altarpiece, commission, st, helena, with, the, true, cross, for, the, roman, church, of, santa, croce, in,

he, spent, much, of, his, time, landscapes, such, as, his, a, view, of, het, steen, in, the, early, morning, national, gallery, london, and, farmers, returning, from, the, fields, pitti, gallery, florence, reflect, the, more, personal, nature, of, many, of, his, later, works, he, also, drew, upon, the, netherlandish, traditions, of, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, for, inspiration, in, later, works, like, feasting, and, dancing, peasants, c, 1630, louvre, paris, rubens, died, from, heart, failure, as, a, result, of, his, chronic, gout, on, 30, may, 1640, he, was, interred, in, the, saint, james, church, in, antwerp, a, burial, chapel, for, the, artist, and, his, family, was, built, in, the, church, construction, on, the, chapel, started, in, 1642, and, was, completed, in, 1650, when, cornelis, van, mildert, the, son, of, rubens, s, friend, the, sculptor, johannes, van, mildert, delivered, the, altarstone, the, chapel, is, a, marble, altar, portico, with, two, columns, framing, the, altarpiece, of, the, virgin, and, child, with, saints, painted, by, rubens, himself, the, painting, expresses, the, basic, tenets, of, the, counter, reformation, through, the, figures, of, the, virgin, and, saints, in, the, upper, niche, of, the, retable, is, a, marble, statue, depicting, the, virgin, as, the, mater, dolorosa, whose, heart, is, pierced, by, a, sword, which, was, likely, sculpted, by, lucas, faydherbe, a, pupil, of, rubens, the, remains, of, rubens, s, second, wife, helena, fourment, and, two, of, her, children, one, of, whom, was, fathered, by, rubens, were, later,

rubens, s, epitaph, written, in, latin, by, his, friend, gaspar, gevartius, was, chiselled, on, the, chapel, floor, in, the, tradition, of, the, renaissance, rubens, is, compared, in, the, epitaph, to, apelles, the, most, famous, painter, of, greek, antiquity, his, biblical, and, mythological, nudes, are, especially, well, known, painted, in, the, baroque, tradition, of, depicting, women, as, soft, bodied, passive, and, to, the, modern, eye, highly, sexualised, beings, his, nudes, emphasise, the, concepts, of, fertility, desire, physical, beauty, temptation, and, virtue, skilfully, rendered, these, paintings, of, nude, women, are, thought, by, feminists, to, have, been, created, to, sexually, appeal, to, his, largely, male, audience, of, patrons, although, the, female, nude, as, an, example, of, beauty, has, been, a, traditional, motif, in, european, art, for, centuries, rubens, was, quite, fond, of, painting, full, figured, women, giving, rise, to, terms, like, rubensian, or, rubenesque, sometimes, rubensesque, his, large, scale, cycle, representing, marie, de, medici, focuses, on, several, classic, female, archetypes, like, the, virgin, consort, wife, widow, and, diplomatic, regent, the, inclusion, of, this, iconography, in, his, female, portraits, along, with, his, art, depicting, noblewomen, of, the, day, serve, to, elevate, his, female, portrait, sitters, to, the, status, and, importance, of, his, male, portrait, sitters, rubens, s, depiction, of, males, is, equally, stylised, replete, with, meaning, and, quite, the, opposite, of, his, female, subjects, his, male, nudes, represent, highly, athletic, and, large, mythical, or, biblical, men, unlike, his, female, nudes, most, of, his, male, nudes, are, depicted, partially, nude, with, sashes, armour, or, shadows, shielding, them, from, being, completely, unclothed, these, men, are, twisting, reaching, bending, and, grasping, all, of, which, portrays, his, male, subjects, engaged, in, a, great, deal, of, physical, sometimes, aggressive, action, the, concepts, rubens, artistically, represents, illustrate, the, male, as, powerful, capable, forceful, and, compelling, the, allegorical, and, symbolic, subjects, he, painted, reference, the, classic, masculine, tropes, of, athleticism, high, achievement, valour, in, war, and, civil, authority, male, archetypes, readily, found, in, rubens, s, paintings, include, the, hero, husband, father, civic, leader, king, and, the, battle, weary, paintings, from, rubens, s, workshop, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, those, he, painted, by, himself, those, he, painted, in, part, mainly, hands, and, faces, and, copies, supervised, from, his, drawings, or, oil, sketches, he, had, as, was, usual, at, the, time, a, large, workshop, with, many, apprentices, and, students, it, has, not, always, been, possible, to, identify, who, were, rubens, s, pupils, and, assistants, since, as, a, court, painter, rubens, was, not, required, to, register, his, pupils, with, the, antwerp, guild, of, saint, luke, about, 20, pupils, or, assistants, of, rubens, have, been, identified, with, various, levels, of, evidence, to, include, them, as, such, it, is, also, not, clear, from, surviving, records, whether, a, particular, person, was, a, pupil, or, assistant, in, rubens, s, workshop, or, was, an, artist, who, was, an, independent, master, collaborating, on, specific, works, with, rubens, the, unknown, jacob, moerman, was, registered, as, his, pupil, while, willem, panneels, and, justus, van, egmont, were,
