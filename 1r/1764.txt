joseph, nic, phore, ni, pce, french, 7, march, 1765, 5, july, 1833, was, a, french, inventor, and, one, of, the, earliest, pioneers, of, photography, ni, pce, developed, heliography, a, technique, he, used, to, create, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, products, of, a, photographic, process, in, the, mid, 1820s, he, used, a, primitive, camera, to, produce, the, oldest, surviving, photograph, of, a, real, world, scene, among, ni, pce, s, other, inventions, was, the, pyr, olophore, one, of, the, world, s, first, internal, combustion, engines, which, he, conceived, created, and, developed, with, his, older, brother, claude, ni, pce, ni, pce, was, born, in, chalon, sur, sa, ne, sa, ne, et, loire, where, his, father, was, a, wealthy, lawyer, his, older, brother, claude, 1763, 1828, was, also, his, collaborator, in, research, and, invention, but, died, half, mad, and, destitute, in, england, having, squandered, the, family, wealth, in, pursuit, of, non, opportunities, for, the, pyr, olophore, ni, pce, also, had, a, sister, and, a, younger, brother, bernard, nic, phore, was, baptized, joseph, but, adopted, the, name, nic, phore, in, honour, of, saint, nicephorus, the, ninth, century, patriarch, of, constantinople, while, studying, at, the, oratorian, college, in, angers, at, the, college, he, learned, science, and, the, experimental, method, rapidly, achieving, success, and, graduating, to, work, as, a, professor, of, the, college, ni, pce, served, as, a, staff, officer, in, the, french, army, under, napoleon, spending, years, in, italy, and, on, the, island, of, sardinia, but, ill, health, forced, him, to, resign, whereupon, he, married, agnes, romero, and, became, the, administrator, of, the, district, of, nice, in, post, revolutionary, france, in, 1795, he, resigned, as, administrator, of, nice, to, pursue, scientific, research, with, his, brother, claude, one, source, reports, his, resignation, to, have, been, forced, due, to, his, unpopularity, in, 1801, the, brothers, returned, to, the, family, s, estates, in, chalon, to, continue, their, scientific, research, and, where, they, were, united, with, their, mother, their, sister, and, their, younger, brother, bernard, here, they, managed, the, family, estate, as, independently, wealthy, gentlemen, farmers, raising, beets, and, producing, sugar, in, 1827, ni, pce, journeyed, to, england, to, visit, his, seriously, ill, elder, brother, claude, ni, pce, who, was, now, living, in, kew, near, london, claude, had, descended, into, delirium, and, squandered, much, of, the, family, fortune, chasing, inappropriate, business, opportunities, for, the, pyr, olophore, nic, phore, ni, pce, died, of, a, stroke, on, 5, july, 1833, financially, ruined, such, that, his, grave, in, the, cemetery, of, saint, loup, de, varennes, was, financed, by, the, municipality, the, cemetery, is, near, the, family, house, where, he, had, experimented, and, had, made, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, photographic, image, his, son, isidore, 1805, 1868, formed, a, partnership, with, daguerre, after, his, father, s, death, and, was, granted, a, government, pension, in, 1839, in, return, for, disclosing, the, technical, details, of, nic, phore, s, heliogravure, process, a, cousin, claude, f, lix, abel, ni, pce, de, saint, victor, 1805, 1870, was, a, chemist, and, was, the, first, to, use, albumen, in, photography, he, also, produced, photographic, engravings, on, steel, during, 1857, 1861, he, discovered, that, uranium, salts, emit, a, form, of, radiation, that, is, invisible, to, the, human, eye, the, date, of, ni, pce, s, first, photographic, experiments, is, uncertain, he, was, led, to, them, by, his, interest, in, the, new, art, of, lithography, for, which, he, realized, he, lacked, the, necessary, skill, and, artistic, ability, and, by, his, acquaintance, with, the, camera, obscura, a, drawing, aid, which, was, popular, among, affluent, dilettantes, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, camera, obscura, s, beautiful, but, fleeting, little, light, paintings, inspired, a, number, of, people, including, thomas, wedgwood, and, henry, fox, talbot, to, seek, some, way, of, capturing, them, more, easily, and, effectively, than, could, be, done, by, tracing, over, them, with, a, pencil, letters, to, his, sister, in, law, around, 1816, indicate, that, ni, pce, had, managed, to, capture, small, camera, images, on, paper, coated, with, silver, chloride, making, him, apparently, the, first, to, have, any, success, at, all, in, such, an, attempt, but, the, results, were, negatives, dark, where, they, should, be, light, and, vice, versa, and, he, could, find, no, way, to, stop, them, from, darkening, all, over, when, brought, into, the, light, for, viewing, ni, pce, turned, his, attention, to, other, substances, that, were, affected, by, light, eventually, concentrating, on, bitumen, of, judea, a, naturally, occurring, asphalt, that, had, been, used, for, various, purposes, since, ancient, times, in, ni, pce, s, time, it, was, used, by, artists, as, an, acid, resistant, coating, on, copper, plates, for, making, etchings, the, artist, scratched, a, drawing, through, the, coating, then, bathed, the, plate, in, acid, to, etch, the, exposed, areas, then, removed, the, coating, with, a, solvent, and, used, the, plate, to, print, ink, copies, of, the, drawing, onto, paper, what, interested, ni, pce, was, the, fact, that, the, bitumen, coating, became, less, soluble, after, it, had, been, left, exposed, to, light, ni, pce, dissolved, bitumen, in, lavender, oil, a, solvent, often, used, in, varnishes, and, thinly, coated, it, onto, a, lithographic, stone, or, a, sheet, of, metal, or, glass, after, the, coating, had, dried, a, test, subject, typically, an, engraving, printed, on, paper, was, laid, over, the, surface, in, close, contact, and, the, two, were, put, out, in, direct, sunlight, after, sufficient, exposure, the, solvent, could, be, used, to, rinse, away, only, the, unhardened, bitumen, that, had, been, shielded, from, light, by, lines, or, dark, areas, in, the, test, subject, the, parts, of, the, surface, thus, laid, bare, could, then, be, etched, with, acid, or, the, remaining, bitumen, could, serve, as, the, water, repellent, material, in, lithographic, printing, ni, pce, called, his, process, heliography, which, literally, means, sun, drawing, in, 1822, he, used, it, to, create, what, is, believed, to, have, been, the, world, s, first, permanent, photographic, image, a, contact, exposed, copy, of, an, engraving, of, pope, pius, vii, but, it, was, later, destroyed, when, ni, pce, attempted, to, make, prints, from, it, the, earliest, surviving, photographic, artifacts, by, ni, pce, made, in, 1825, are, copies, of, a, 17th, century, engraving, of, a, man, with, a, horse, and, of, what, may, be, an, etching, or, engraving, of, a, woman, with, a, spinning, wheel, they, are, simply, sheets, of, plain, paper, printed, with, ink, in, a, printing, press, like, ordinary, etchings, engravings, or, lithographs, but, the, plates, used, to, print, them, were, created, photographically, by, ni, pce, s, process, rather, than, by, laborious, and, inexact, hand, engraving, or, drawing, on, lithographic, stones, they, thus, are, photo, etchings, one, example, of, the, print, of, the, man, with, a, horse, and, two, examples, of, the, print, of, the, woman, with, the, spinning, wheel, are, known, to, have, survived, the, former, is, in, the, collection, of, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, in, paris, and, the, latter, two, are, in, a, private, collection, in, westport, connecticut, ni, pce, s, correspondence, with, his, brother, claude, has, preserved, the, fact, that, his, first, real, success, in, using, bitumen, to, create, a, permanent, photograph, of, the, image, in, a, camera, obscura, came, sometime, between, 1822, and, 1827, the, result, is, now, the, oldest, known, camera, photograph, still, in, existence, the, historic, image, had, seemingly, been, lost, early, in, the, 20th, century, but, photography, historians, helmut, and, alison, gernsheim, succeeded, in, tracking, it, down, in, 1952, the, exposure, time, required, to, make, it, is, usually, said, to, have, been, eight, or, nine, hours, but, that, is, a, mid, 20th, century, assumption, based, largely, on, the, fact, that, the, sun, lights, the, buildings, on, opposite, sides, as, if, from, an, arc, across, the, sky, indicating, an, essentially, day, long, exposure, a, later, researcher, who, used, ni, pce, s, notes, and, historically, correct, materials, to, recreate, his, processes, found, that, in, fact, several, days, of, exposure, in, the, camera, were, needed, to, adequately, capture, such, an, image, on, a, bitumen, coated, plate, in, 1829, ni, pce, entered, into, a, partnership, with, louis, daguerre, who, was, also, seeking, a, means, of, creating, permanent, photographic, images, with, a, camera, together, they, developed, the, physautotype, an, improved, process, that, used, lavender, oil, distillate, as, the, photosensitive, substance, the, partnership, lasted, until, ni, pce, s, death, in, 1833, after, which, daguerre, continued, to, experiment, eventually, working, out, a, process, that, only, superficially, resembled, ni, pce, s, he, named, it, the, daguerr, otype, after, himself, in, 1839, he, managed, to, get, the, government, of, france, to, purchase, his, invention, on, behalf, of, the, people, of, france, the, french, government, agreed, to, award, daguerre, a, yearly, stipend, of, 6, 000, francs, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, to, give, the, estate, of, ni, pce, 4, 000, francs, yearly, this, arrangement, rankled, ni, pce, s, son, who, claimed, daguerre, was, reaping, all, the, benefits, of, his, father, s, work, in, some, ways, he, was, right, for, many, years, ni, pce, received, little, credit, for, his, contribution, later, historians, have, reclaimed, ni, pce, from, relative, obscurity, and, it, is, now, generally, recognized, that, his, heliography, was, the, first, successful, example, of, what, we, now, call, photography, the, creation, of, a, reasonably, light, fast, and, permanent, image, by, the, action, of, light, on, a, light, sensitive, surface, and, subsequent, processing, although, initially, ignored, amid, the, excitement, caused, by, the, introduction, of, the, daguerreotype, and, far, too, insensitive, to, be, practical, for, making, photographs, with, a, camera, the, utility, of, ni, pce, s, original, process, for, its, primary, purpose, was, eventually, realized, from, the, 1850s, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, a, thin, coating, of, bitumen, was, widely, used, as, a, slow, but, very, effective, and, economical, photoresist, for, making, printing, plates, the, pyr, olophore, one, of, the, world, s, first, internal, combustion, engines, that, was, actually, built, was, invented, and, patented, by, the, ni, pce, brothers, in, 1807, this, engine, ran, on, controlled, dust, explosions, of, lycopodium, powder, and, was, installed, on, a, boat, that, ran, on, the, river, sa, ne, ten, years, later, the, brothers, were, the, first, in, the, world, to, make, an, engine, work, with, a, fuel, injection, system, in, 1807, the, imperial, government, opened, a, competition, for, a, hydraulic, machine, to, replace, the, original, marly, machine, located, in, marly, le, roi, that, delivered, water, to, the, palace, of, versailles, from, the, seine, river, the, machine, was, built, in, bougival, in, 1684, from, where, it, pumped, water, a, distance, of, one, kilometer, and, raised, it, 150, meters, the, ni, pce, brothers, conceived, a, new, hydrostatic, principle, for, the, machine, and, improved, it, once, more, in, 1809, the, machine, had, undergone, changes, in, many, of, its, parts, including, more, precise, pistons, creating, far, less, resistance, they, tested, it, many, times, and, the, result, was, that, with, a, stream, drop, of, 4, feet, 4, inches, it, lifted, water, 11, feet, but, in, december, 1809, they, got, a, message, that, they, had, waited, too, long, and, the, emperor, had, taken, on, himself, the, decision, to, ask, the, engineer, p, rier, 1742, 1818, to, build, a, steam, engine, to, operate, the, pumps, at, marly, in, 1818, ni, pce, became, interested, in, the, ancestor, of, the, bicycle, a, laufmaschine, invented, by, karl, von, drais, in, 1817, he, built, himself, a, model, and, called, it, the, v, locip, de, fast, foot, and, caused, quite, a, sensation, on, the, local, country, roads, ni, pce, improved, his, machine, with, an, adjustable, saddle, and, it, is, now, exhibited, at, the, ni, pce, museum, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, nic, phore, contemplated, motorizing, his, machine, the, lunar, crater, ni, pce, is, named, after, him, the, ni, pce, heliograph, is, on, permanent, display, at, the, harry, ransom, center, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, the, object, was, located, by, historians, alison, and, helmut, gernsheim, in, 1952, and, sold, to, the, humanities, research, center, later, renamed, the, harry, ransom, center, in, 1963, the, ni, pce, prize, has, been, awarded, annually, since, 1955, to, a, professional, photographer, who, has, lived, and, worked, in, france, for, over, 3, years, it, was, introduced, in, honour, of, ni, pce, by, albert, pl, cy, of, the, l, association, gens, d, images
