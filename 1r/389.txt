of, his, mother, s, political, outlook, which, was, supportive, of, the, french, third, republic, and, near, the, liberal, centre, of, french, politics, in, an, 1892, article, published, in, le, banquet, entitled, l, irr, ligion, d, tat, proust, condemned, extreme, anti, clerical, measures, such, as, the, expulsion, of, monks, observing, that, one, might, just, be, surprised, that, the, negation, of, religion, should, bring, in, its, wake, the, same, fanaticism, intolerance, and, persecution, as, religion, itself, he, argued, that, socialism, posed, a, greater, threat, to, society, than, the, church, he, was, equally, critical, of, the, right, lambasting, the, insanity, of, the, conservatives, whom, he, deemed, as, dumb, and, ungrateful, as, under, charles, x, and, referring, to, pope, pius, x, s, obstinacy, as, foolish, proust, always, rejected, the, bigoted, and, illiberal, views, harbored, by, many, priests, at, the, time, but, believed, that, the, most, enlightened, clerics, could, be, just, as, progressive, as, the, most, enlightened, secularists, and, that, both, could, serve, the, cause, of, the, advanced, liberal, republic, he, approved, of, the, more, moderate, stance, taken, in, 1906, by, aristide, briand, whom, he, described, as, admirable, proust, was, among, the, earliest, dreyfusards, even, attending, mile, zola, s, trial, and, proudly,

fran, aise, published, a, manifesto, upholding, french, colonialism, and, the, catholic, church, as, the, embodiment, of, civilised, values, proust, rejected, their, nationalistic, and, chauvinistic, views, in, favor, of, a, liberal, pluralist, vision, which, acknowledged, christianity, s, cultural, legacy, in, france, julien, benda, commended, proust, in, la, trahison, des, clercs, as, a, writer, who, distinguished, himself, from, his, generation, by, avoiding, the, twin, traps, of, nationalism, and, class, sectarianism, proust, was, considered, a, hypochondriac, by, his, doctors, his, correspondence, provides, some, clues, on, his, symptoms, according, to, yellowlees, douglas, proust, suffered, from, the, vascular, subtype, of, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, proust, was, involved, in, writing, and, publishing, from, an, early, age, in, addition, to, the, literary, magazines, with, which, he, was, associated, and, in, which, he, published, while, at, school, la, revue, verte, and,

also, the, french, title, of, plato, s, symposium, and, throughout, the, next, several, years, proust, published, small, pieces, regularly, in, this, journal, and, in, the, prestigious, la, revue, blanche, in, 1896, les, plaisirs, et, les, jours, a, compendium, of, many, of, these, early, pieces, was, published, the, book, included, a, foreword, by, anatole, france, drawings, by, mme, lemaire,

verdurin, s, la, raspeli, re, in, summer, 1894, and, for, three, weeks, in, 1895, this, book, was, so, sumptuously, produced, that, it, cost, twice, the, normal, price, of, a, book, its, size, that, year, proust, also, began, working, on, a, novel, which, was, eventually, published, in, 1952, and, titled, jean, santeuil, by, his, posthumous, editors, many, of, the, themes, later, developed, in, in, search, of, lost, time, find, their, first, articulation, in, this, unfinished, work, including, the, enigma, of, memory, and, the, necessity, of, reflection, several, sections, of, in, search, of, lost, time, can, be, read, in, the, first, draft, in, jean, santeuil, the, portrait, of, the, parents, in, jean, santeuil, is, quite, harsh, in, marked, contrast, to, the, adoration, with, which, the, parents, are, painted, in, proust, s, masterpiece, following, the, poor, reception, of, les, plaisirs, et, les, jours, and, internal, troubles, with, resolving, the, plot, proust, gradually, abandoned, jean, santeuil, in, 1897, and, stopped, work, on, it, entirely, by, 1899, beginning, in, 1895, proust, spent, several, years, reading, thomas, carlyle, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, john, ruskin, through, this, reading, he, refined, his, theories, of, art, and, the, role, of, the, artist, in, society, also, in, time, regained, proust, s, universal, protagonist, recalls, having, translated, ruskin, s, sesame, and, lilies, the, artist, s, responsibility, is, to, confront, the, appearance, of, nature, deduce, its, essence, and, retell, or, explain, that, essence, in, the, work, of, art, ruskin, s, view, of, artistic, production, was, central, to, this, conception, and, ruskin, s, work, was, so, important, to, proust, that, he, claimed, to, know, by, heart, several, of, ruskin, s, books, including, the, seven, lamps, of, architecture, the, bible, of, amiens, and, praeterita, proust, set, out, to, translate, two, of, ruskin, s, works, into, french, but, was, hampered, by, an, imperfect, command, of, english, to, compensate, for, this, he, made, his, translations, a, group, affair, sketched, out, by, his, mother, the, drafts, were, first, revised, by, proust, then, by, marie, nordlinger, the, english, cousin, of, his, friend, and, sometime, lover, reynaldo, hahn, then, finally, polished, by, proust, questioned, about, his, method, by, an, editor, proust,

translation, and, the, introduction, were, well, reviewed, henri, bergson, called, proust, s, introduction, an, important, contribution, to, the, psychology, of, ruskin, and, had, similar, praise, for, the, translation, at, the, time, of, this, publication, proust, was, already, translating, ruskin, s, sesame, and, lilies, which, he, completed, in, june, 1905, just, before, his, mother, s, death, and, published, in, 1906, literary, historians, and, critics, have, ascertained, that, apart, from, ruskin, proust, s, chief, literary, influences, included, saint, simon, montaigne, stendhal,

gothic, cathedrals, probably, the, highest, and, unquestionably, the, most, original, expression, of, french, genius, 1908, was, an, important, year, for, proust, s, development, as, a, writer, during, the, first, part, of, the, year, he, published, in, various, journals, pastiches, of, other, writers, these, exercises, in, imitation, may, have, allowed, proust, to, solidify, his, own, style, in, addition, in, the, spring, and, summer, of, the, year, proust, began, work, on, several, different, fragments, of, writing, that, would, later, coalesce, under, the, working, title, of,

fragments, proust, began, to, shape, a, novel, on, which, he, worked, continually, during, this, period, the, rough, outline, of, the, work, centred, on, a, first, person, narrator, unable, to, sleep, who, during, the, night, remembers, waiting, as, a, child, for, his, mother, to, come, to, him, in, the, morning, the, novel, was, to, have, ended, with, a, critical, examination, of, sainte, beuve, and, a, refutation, of, his, theory, that, biography, was, the, most, important, tool, for, understanding, an, artist, s, work, present, in, the, unfinished, manuscript, notebooks, are, many, elements, that, correspond, to, parts, of, the, recherche, in, particular, to, the, combray, and, swann, in, love, sections, of, volume, 1, and, to, the, final, section, of, volume, 7, trouble, with, finding, a, publisher, as, well, as, a, gradually, changing, conception, of, his, novel, led, proust, to, shift, work, to, a, substantially, different, project, that, still, contained, many, of, the, same, themes, and, elements, by, 1910, he, was, at, work, on, la, recherche, du, temps, perdu, begun, in, 1909, when, proust, was, 38, years, old, la, recherche, du, temps, perdu, consists, of, seven,

so, taken, with, his, work, the, first, volume, was, refused, by, the, publisher, gallimard, on, gide, s, advice, he, later, wrote, to, proust, apologizing, for, his, part, in, the, refusal, and, calling, it, one, of, the, most, serious, mistakes, of, his, life, finally, the, book, was, published, at, the, author, s, expense, by, grasset, and, proust, paid, critics, to, speak, favorably, about, it, proust, died, before, he, was, able, to, complete, his, revision, of, the, drafts, and, proofs, of, the, final, volumes, the, last, three, of, which, were, published, posthumously, and,
