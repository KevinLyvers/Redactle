state, as, crimes, against, humanity, in, 1890, these, and, other, facts, were, established, during, leopold, s, rule, by, eyewitness, testimony, by, on, site, inspection, from, an, international, commission, of, inquiry, by, the, investigative, journalism, and, activism, of, e, d, morel, and, by, the, 1904, casement, report, while, it, has, proven, difficult, to, accurately, estimate, the, pre, colonial, population, and, the, amount, by, which, it, changed, under, the, congo, free, state, estimates, for, the, congolese, population, decline, during, leopold, s, rule, range, from, 1,

he, had, reached, the, rank, of, lieutenant, general, leopold, s, public, career, began, on, his, attaining, the, age, of, majority, in, 1855, when, he, became, a, member, of, the, belgian, senate, he, took, an, active, interest, in, the, senate, especially, in, matters, concerning, the, development, of, belgium, and, its, trade, and, began, to, urge, belgium, s, acquisition, of, colonies, leopold, traveled, abroad, extensively, from, 1854, to, 1865, visiting, india, china, egypt, and, the, countries, on, the, mediterranean, coast, of, africa, his, father, died, on, 10, december, 1865, and, leopold, took, the, oath, of, office, on, 17, december, at, the, age, of, 30, he, also, served, in, the, belgian, senate, during, this, time, leopold, became, king, in, 1865, he, explained, his, goal, for, his, reign, in, an, 1888, letter, addressed, to, his, brother, prince, philippe, count, of, flanders, the, country, must, be, strong, prosperous, therefore, have, colonies, of, her, own, beautiful, and, calm, leopold, s, reign, was, marked, by, a, number, of, major, political, developments, the, liberals, governed, belgium, from, 1857, to, 1880, and, during, its, final, year, in, power, legislated, the, fr, re, orban, law, of, 1879, this, law, created, free, secular, compulsory, primary, schools, supported, by, the, state, and, withdrew, all, state, support, from, roman, catholic, primary, schools, the, catholic, party, obtained, a, parliamentary, majority, in, 1880, and, four, years, later, restored, state, support, to, catholic, schools, in, 1885, various, socialist, and, social, democratic, groups, drew, together, and, formed, the, labour, party, increasing, social, unrest, and, the, rise, of, the, labour, party, forced, the, adoption, of, universal, male, suffrage, in, 1893, during, leopold, s, reign, other, social, changes, were, enacted, into, law, among, these, were, the, right, of, workers, to, form, labour, unions, and, the, abolition, of, the, livret, d, ouvrier, an, employment, record, book, laws, against, child, labour, were, passed, children, younger, than, 12, were, not, allowed, to, work, in, factories, children, younger, than, 16, were, not, allowed, to, work, at, night, and, women, younger, than, 21, years, old, were, not, allowed, to, work, underground, workers, gained, the, right, to, be, compensated, for, workplace, accidents, and, were, given, sundays, off, leopold, s, reluctance, to, use, the, dutch, language, in, public, did, little, to, solve, the, linguistic, conflict, in, belgium, and, made, him, more, unpopular, than, his, father, with, the, flemish, movement, however, his, nephew, and, heir, prince, baudouin, became, something, of, a, hero, to, the, flemings, and, leopold, did, make, some, speeches, in, dutch, shortly, before, and, after, baudouin, s, premature, death, in, 1891, the, first, revision, of, the, belgian, constitution, came, in, 1893, universal, male, suffrage, was, introduced, though, the, effect, of, this, was, tempered, by, plural, voting, the, eligibility, requirements, for, the, senate, were, reduced, and, elections, would, be, based, on, a, system, of, proportional, representation, which, continues, to, this, day, leopold, pushed, strongly, to, enable, a, royal, referendum, whereby, the, king, would, have, the, power, to, consult, the, electorate, directly, on, an, issue, and, use, his, veto, according, to, the, results, of, the, referendum, the, proposal, was, rejected, as, it, would, have, given, the, king, the, power, to, override, the, elected, government, leopold, was, so, disappointed, that, he, considered, abdication, leopold, emphasized, military, defence, as, the, basis, of, neutrality, and, strove, to, make, belgium, less, vulnerable, militarily, he, achieved, the, construction, of, defensive, fortresses, at, li, ge, at, namur, and, at, antwerp, during, the, franco, prussian, war, he, managed, to, preserve, belgium, s, neutrality, in, a, period, of, unusual, difficulty, and, danger, leopold, pushed, for, a, reform, in, military, service, but, he, was, unable, to, obtain, one, until, he, was, on, his, deathbed, the, belgian, army, was, a, combination, of, volunteers, and, a, lottery, and, it, was, possible, for, men, to, pay, for, substitutes, for, service, this, was, replaced, by, a, system, in, which, one, son, in, every, family, would, have, to, serve, in, the, military, according, to, historian, jean, stengers, leopold, ii, s, imperialism, was, driven, by, economic, advantage, rather, than, political, grandeur, leopold, sought, to, maximize, profit, through, efficient, exploitation, including, forced, labor, and, direct, revenue, however, stengers, emphasizes, that, leopold, s, voracity, was, not, solely, for, personal, enrichment, it, was, also, rooted, in, patriotism, a, desire, to, ensure, belgium, s, prosperity, and, embellishment, leopold, commissioned, a, great, number, of, buildings, urban, projects, and, public, works, according, to, the, historians, wm, roger, louis, and, adam, hochschild, this, was, largely, possible, thanks, to, the, profits, generated, from, the, congo, free, state, though, this, is, highly, disputed, these, projects, earned, him, the, epithet, of, builder, king, dutch, koning, bouwheer, french, roi, b, tisseur, the, public, buildings, were, mainly, in, brussels, ostend, tervuren, and, antwerp, and, include, the, parc, du, cinquantenaire, jubelpark, 1852, 1880, memorial, arcade, and, complex, the, basilica, of, the, sacred, heart, 1905, 1969, and, duden, park, in, brussels, 1881, the, hippodrome, wellington, racetrack, 1883, the, royal, galleries, and, maria, hendrikapark, in, ostend, 1902, the, royal, museum, for, central, africa, and, its, surrounding, park, in, tervuren, 1898, and, antwerpen, centraal, railway, station, in, antwerp, 1895, 1905, in, addition, to, his, public, works, leopold, acquired, and, built, numerous, private, properties, for, himself, inside, and, outside, belgium, he, expanded, the, grounds, of, the, royal, castle, of, laeken, and, built, the, royal, greenhouses, as, well, as, the, japanese, tower, and, the, chinese, pavilion, near, the, palace, now, the, museums, of, the, far, east, in, the, ardennes, his, domains, consisted, of, 6, 700, hectares, 17, 000, acres, of, forests, and, agricultural, lands, and, the, ch, teaux, of, ardenne, ciergnon, fenffe, villers, sur, lesse, and, ferage, he, also, built, important, country, estates, on, the, french, riviera, including, the, villa, des, c, dres, and, its, botanical, garden, and, the, villa, leopolda, thinking, of, the, future, after, his, death, leopold, did, not, want, the, collection, of, estates, lands, and, heritage, buildings, he, had, privately, amassed, to, be, scattered, among, his, daughters, each, of, whom, was, married, to, a, foreign, prince, in, 1900, he, created, the, royal, trust, by, means, of, which, he, donated, most, of, his, properties, to, the, belgian, nation, in, perpetuity, and, arranged, for, the, royal, family, to, continue, using, them, after, his, death, on, 15, november, 1902, italian, anarchist, gennaro, rubino, attempted, to, assassinate, leopold, who, was, riding, in, a, royal, cortege, from, a, ceremony, at, church, of, st, michael, and, st, gudula, in, memory, of, his, recently, deceased, wife, marie, henriette, after, leopold, s, carriage, passed, rubino, fired, three, shots, at, the, procession, the, shots, missed, leopold, but, almost, killed, the, king, s, grand, marshal, count, charles, john, d, oultremont, rubino, was, immediately, arrested, and, subsequently, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, he, died, in, prison, in, 1918, the, king, replied, after, the, attack, to, a, senator, my, dear, senator, if, fate, wants, me, shot, too, bad, mon, cher, s, nateur, si, la, fatalit, veut, que, je, sois, atteint, tant, pis, after, the, failed, regicide, the, king, s, security, was, questioned, because, the, glass, of, the, landaus, was, 2, cm, thick, elsewhere, in, europe, the, news, of, this, assassination, attempt, was, received, with, alarm, heads, of, state, and, the, pope, sent, telegrams, to, the, king, congratulating, him, for, surviving, the, assassination, attempt, the, belgians, rejoiced, that, the, king, was, safe, later, in, the, day, in, the, royal, theatre, of, la, monnaie, before, tristan, und, isolde, was, performed, the, orchestra, played, the, braban, onne, which, was, sung, loudly, and, ended, with, loud, cheers, and, applause, leopold, was, the, founder, and, sole, owner, of, the, congo, free, state, a, private, project, undertaken, on, his, own, behalf, 136, he, used, explorer, henry, morton, stanley, to, help, him, lay, claim, to, the, congo, an, area, now, known, as, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, at, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, the, colonial, nations, of, europe, authorised, his, claim, by, committing, the, congo, free, state, to, improving, the, lives, of, the, people, 122, 124, the, central, services, of, the, state, were, located, in, brussels, all, officials, within, the, congo, were, belgian, including, those, in, administration, the, army, and, the, courts, belgian, officers, from, the, army, played, an, essential, role, in, the, congo, s, governance, even, religious, missions, especially, catholic, ones, had, a, distinctly, belgian, character, from, the, beginning, leopold, ignored, these, conditions, he, ran, the, congo, using, the, mercenary, force, publique, for, his, personal, enrichment, failure, to, meet, rubber, collection, quotas, was, punishable, by, death, meanwhile, the, force, publique, were, required, to, provide, the, hand, of, their, victims, as, proof, when, they, had, shot, and, killed, someone, as, it, was, believed, that, they, would, otherwise, use, the, munitions, imported, from, europe, at, considerable, cost, for, hunting, as, a, consequence, the, rubber, quotas, were, in, part, paid, off, in, chopped, off, hands, leopold, extracted, a, fortune, from, the, congo, initially, by, the, collection, of, ivory, and, after, a, rise, in, the, price, of, rubber, in, the, 1890s, by, forced, labour, from, the, people, to, harvest, and, process, rubber, shortly, after, the, brussels, anti, slavery, conference, 1889, 1890, leopold, issued, a, new, decree, mandating, that, africans, in, a, large, part, of, the, free, state, could, sell, their, harvested, products, mostly, ivory, and, rubber, only, to, the, state, this, law, extended, an, earlier, decree, declaring, that, all, unoccupied, land, belonged, to, the, state, any, ivory, or, rubber, collected, from, the, state, owned, land, the, reasoning, went, must, belong, to, the, state, thus, creating, a, de, facto, state, controlled, monopoly, therefore, a, large, share, of, the, local, population, could, sell, only, to, the, state, which, could, set, prices, and, thereby, control, the, income, the, congolese, could, receive, for, their, work, for, local, elites, however, this, system, presented, new, opportunities, as, the, free, state, and, concession, companies, paid, them, with, guns, to, tax, their, subjects, in, kind, under, his, regime, millions, of, congolese, inhabitants, including, children, were, mutilated, killed, or, died, from, disease, and, famine, 115, 118, 127, in, addition, the, birth, rate, rapidly, declined, during, this, period, estimates, for, the, total, population, decline, range, from, 1, million, to, 15, million, with, a, consensus, growing, around, 10, million, 25, several, historians, argue, against, this, figure, due, to, the, absence, of, reliable, censuses, the, enormous, mortality, of, diseases, such, as, smallpox, or, sleeping, sickness, and, the, fact, that, there, were, only, 175, administrative, agents, in, charge, of, rubber, exploitation, reports, of, deaths, and, abuse, led, to, a, major, international, scandal, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, leopold, was, forced, by, the, belgian, government, to, relinquish, control, of, the, colony, to, the, civil, administration, in, 1908, leopold, fervently, believed, that, overseas, colonies, were, the, key, to, a, country, s, greatness, and, he, worked, tirelessly, to, acquire, colonial, territory, for, belgium, he, envisioned, our, little, belgium, as, the, capital, of, a, large, overseas, empire, leopold, eventually, began, to, acquire, a, colony, as, a, private, citizen, the, belgian, government, lent, him, money, for, this, venture, during, his, reign, leopold, saw, the, empires, of, the, netherlands, portugal, and, spain, as, being, in, a, state, of, decline, and, expressed, interest, in, buying, their, territories, in, 1866, leopold, instructed, the, belgian, ambassador, in, madrid, to, speak, to, queen, isabella, ii, of, spain, about, ceding, the, philippines, to, belgium, but, the, ambassador, did, nothing, leopold, quickly, replaced, the, ambassador, with, a, more, sympathetic, individual, to, carry, out, his, plan, in, 1868, when, isabella, ii, was, deposed, as, queen, of, spain, leopold, tried, to, press, his, original, plan, to, acquire, the, philippines, but, without, funds, he, was, unsuccessful, leopold, then, devised, another, unsuccessful, plan, to, establish, the, philippines, as, an, independent, state, which, could, then, be, ruled, by, a, belgian, when, both, of, these, plans, failed, leopold, shifted, his, aspirations, of, colonisation, to, africa, after, numerous, unsuccessful, schemes, to, acquire, colonies, in, africa, and, asia, in, 1876, leopold, organized, a, private, holding, company, disguised, as, an, international, scientific, and, philanthropic, association, which, he, called, the, international, african, society, or, the, international, association, for, the, exploration, and, civilization, of, the, congo, in, 1878, under, the, auspices, of, the, holding, company, he, hired, explorer, henry, stanley, to, explore, and, establish, a, colony, in, the, congo, region, 62, much, diplomatic, maneuvering, among, european, nations, resulted, in, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, regarding, african, affairs, at, which, representatives, of, 14, european, countries, and, the, united, states, recognized, leopold, as, sovereign, of, most, of, the, area, to, which, he, and, stanley, had, laid, claim, 84, 87, on, 5, february, 1885, the, congo, free, state, an, area, 76, times, larger, than, belgium, was, established, under, leopold, ii, s, personal, rule, and, private, army, the, force, publique, 123, 124, in, 1894, king, leopold, signed, a, treaty, with, great, britain, which, conceded, a, strip, of, land, on, the, congo, free, state, s, eastern, border, in, exchange, for, a, lifetime, lease, of, the, lado, enclave, which, provided, access, to, the, navigable, nile, and, extended, the, free, state, s, sphere, of, influence, northwards, into, sudan, after, rubber, profits, soared, in, 1895, leopold, ordered, the, organization, of, an, expedition, into, the, lado, enclave, which, had, been, overrun, by, mahdist, rebels, since, the, outbreak, of, the, mahdist, war, in, 1881, the, expedition, was, composed, of, two, columns, the, first, under, belgian, baron, dhanis, consisted, of, a, sizable, force, numbering, around, 3, 000, and, was, to, strike, north, through, the, jungle, and, attack, the, rebels, at, their, base, at, rejaf, the, second, a, much, smaller, force, of, 800, was, led, by, louis, napol, on, chaltin, and, took, the, main, road, towards, rejaf, both, expeditions, set, out, in, december, 1896, although, leopold, had, initially, planned, for, the, expedition, to, carry, on, much, farther, than, the, lado, enclave, hoping, indeed, to, take, fashoda, and, then, khartoum, dhanis, column, mutinied, in, february, 1897, resulting, in, the, death, of, several, belgian, officers, and, the, loss, of, his, entire, force, nonetheless, chaltin, continued, his, advance, and, on, 17, february, 1897, his, outnumbered, forces, defeated, the, rebels, in, the, battle, of, rejaf, securing, the, lado, enclave, as, free, state, territory, until, leopold, s, death, in, 1909, leopold, was, responsible, for, the, theft, of, vast, fortunes, from, the, congolese, people, by, exploiting, the, nation, s, natural, resources, at, first, mass, amounts, of, ivory, was, taken, from, the, country, but, this, did, not, yield, the, expected, levels, of, revenue, when, the, global, demand, for, rubber, exploded, exploitative, efforts, shifted, to, the, labour, intensive, collection, of, sap, from, rubber, plants, violating, the, commitments, made, at, the, berlin, conference, in, the, late, 1890s, the, free, state, government, restricted, foreign, access, and, extorted, forced, labour, from, the, native, people, held, against, their, will, abuses, especially, in, the, rubber, industry, included, forced, labour, of, the, native, population, physical, assault, widespread, murder, and, frequent, mutilation, when, production, quotas, were, not, met, one, practice, used, to, force, workers, to, collect, rubber, included, taking, wives, and, family, members, hostage, missionary, john, harris, of, baringa, was, so, shocked, by, what, he, had, encountered, that, he, wrote, to, leopold, s, chief, agent, in, the, congo, saying, i, have, just, returned, from, a, journey, inland, to, the, village, of, insongo, mboyo, the, abject, misery, and, utter, abandon, is, positively, indescribable, i, was, so, moved, your, excellency, by, the, people, s, stories, that, i, took, the, liberty, of, promising, them, that, in, future, you, will, only, kill, them, for, crimes, they, commit, estimates, of, the, death, toll, range, from, one, million, to, fifteen, million, since, accurate, records, were, not, kept, historians, louis, and, stengers, in, 1968, stated, that, population, figures, at, the, start, of, leopold, s, control, are, only, wild, guesses, and, that, attempts, by, e, d, morel, and, others, to, determine, a, figure, for, the, loss, of, population, were, but, figments, of, the, imagination, adam, hochschild, devotes, a, chapter, of, his, 1998, book, king, leopold, s, ghost, to, the, problem, of, estimating, the, death, toll, he, cites, several, recent, lines, of, investigation, by, anthropologist, jan, vansina, and, others, that, examine, local, sources, police, records, religious, records, oral, traditions, genealogies, personal, diaries, and, many, others, which, generally, agree, with, the, assessment, of, the, 1919, belgian, government, commission, roughly, half, the, population, were, killed, or, died, during, the, free, state, period, hochschild, points, out, that, since, the, first, official, census, by, the, belgian, authorities, in, 1924, put, the, population, at, about, 10, million, these, various, approaches, suggest, a, rough, estimate, of, a, population, decline, by, 10, million, 225, 233, smallpox, epidemics, and, sleeping, sickness, also, devastated, the, deeply, traumatized, population, by, 1896, african, trypanosomiasis, had, killed, up, to, 5, 000, people, in, the, village, of, lukolela, on, the, congo, river, the, mortality, statistics, were, collected, through, the, efforts, of, british, consul, roger, casement, who, found, for, example, only, 600, survivors, of, the, disease, in, lukolela, in, 1903, research, by, lowes, and, montero, found, king, leopold, ii, s, coercive, labor, practices, for, rubber, extraction, in, the, congo, free, state, had, long, lasting, negative, impacts, ethnic, groups, subjected, to, more, intensive, rubber, exploitation, exhibited, significantly, lower, economic, development, over, a, century, later, driven, by, disruptions, to, traditional, economic, systems, and, human, capital, accumulation, their, work, also, examined, how, colonial, co, option, of, local, chiefs, during, the, rubber, era, may, have, undermined, leader, accountability, linking, to, broader, critiques, of, indirect, rule, strategies, across, africa, the, oppressive, policies, under, leopold, s, personal, rule, are, seen, as, engendering, entrenched, underdevelopment, with, enduring, economic, and, political, consequences, in, the, region, inspired, by, works, such, as, joseph, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, 1902, originally, published, as, a, three, part, series, in, blackwood, s, magazine, 1899, and, based, on, conrad, s, experience, as, a, steamer, captain, on, the, congo, 12, years, earlier, international, criticism, of, leopold, s, rule, increased, and, mobilized, reports, of, outrageous, exploitation, and, widespread, human, rights, abuses, led, the, british, crown, to, appoint, their, consul, roger, casement, to, investigate, conditions, there, his, extensive, travels, and, interviews, in, the, region, resulted, in, the, casement, report, which, detailed, the, extensive, abuses, under, leopold, s, regime, a, widespread, war, of, words, ensued, in, britain, former, shipping, clerk, e, d, morel, with, casement, s, support, founded, the, congo, reform, association, the, first, mass, human, rights, movement, supporters, included, american, writer, mark, twain, whose, stinging, political, satire, entitled, king, leopold, s, soliloquy, portrays, the, king, arguing, that, bringing, christianity, to, the, country, outweighs, a, little, starvation, and, uses, many, of, leopold, s, own, words, against, him, writer, arthur, conan, doyle, also, criticised, the, rubber, regime, in, his, 1908, work, the, crime, of, the, congo, written, to, aid, the, work, of, the, congo, reform, association, doyle, contrasted, leopold, s, rule, with, british, rule, in, nigeria, arguing, that, decency, required, those, who, ruled, primitive, peoples, to, be, concerned, first, with, their, uplift, not, how, much, could, be, extracted, from, them, as, hochschild, describes, in, king, leopold, s, ghost, many, of, leopold, s, policies, in, particular, those, of, colonial, monopolies, and, forced, labour, were, influenced, by, dutch, practice, in, the, east, indies, 37, similar, methods, of, forced, labour, were, employed, to, some, degree, by, germany, france, and, portugal, where, natural, rubber, occurred, in, their, own, colonies, 280, international, opposition, and, criticism, at, home, from, the, catholic, party, progressive, liberals, and, the, labour, party, caused, the, belgian, parliament, to, compel, the, king, to, cede, the, congo, free, state, to, belgium, in, 1908, the, deal, that, led, to, the, handover, cost, belgium, the, considerable, sum, of, 215, 5, million, francs, this, was, used, to, discharge, the, debt, of, the, congo, free, state, and, to, pay, out, its, bond, holders, as, well, as, 45, 5, million, for, leopold, s, pet, building, projects, in, belgium, and, a, personal, payment, of, 50, million, to, him, 259, the, congo, free, state, was, transformed, into, a, belgian, colony, under, parliamentary, control, known, as, the, belgian, congo, leopold, went, to, great, lengths, to, conceal, potential, evidence, of, wrongdoing, during, his, time, as, ruler, of, his, private, colony, the, entire, archive, of, the, congo, free, state, was, burned, and, he, told, his, aide, that, even, though, the, congo, had, been, taken, from, him, they, have, no, right, to, know, what, i, did, there, 294, when, the, belgian, government, took, over, the, administration, in, 1908, the, situation, in, the, congo, improved, in, certain, respects, the, brutal, exploitation, and, arbitrary, use, of, violence, in, which, some, of, the, concessionary, companies, had, excelled, were, curbed, article, 3, of, the, new, colonial, charter, of, 18, october, 1908, stated, that, nobody, can, be, forced, to, work, on, behalf, of, and, for, the, profit, of, companies, or, privates, but, this, was, not, enforced, and, the, belgian, government, continued, to, impose, forced, labour, on, the, natives, albeit, by, less, obvious, methods, the, belgian, congo, gained, independence, in, 1960, and, became, known, as, the, republic, of, the, congo, on, 17, december, 1909, leopold, ii, died, at, laeken, from, embolism, and, the, belgian, crown, passed, to, albert, i, the, son, of, leopold, s, brother, philippe, count, of, flanders, his, funeral, cortege, was, booed, by, the, crowd, in, expression, of, disapproval, of, his, rule, leopold, s, reign, of, exactly, 44, years, remains, the, longest, in, belgian, history, he, was, interred, in, the, royal, vault, at, the, church, of, our, lady, of, laeken, attention, to, the, congo, atrocities, subsided, in, the, years, after, leopold, s, death, statues, of, him, were, erected, in, the, 1930s, at, the, initiative, of, albert, i, while, the, belgian, government, celebrated, his, accomplishments, in, belgium, the, debate, over, leopold, s, legacy, was, reignited, in, 1999, with, the, publication, of, king, leopold, s, ghost, by, american, historian, adam, hochschild, which, recounts, leopold, s, plan, to, acquire, the, colony, the, exploitation, and, the, large, death, toll, the, debate, then, periodically, resurfaced, over, the, following, 20, years, in, 2010, louis, michel, a, belgian, member, of, the, european, parliament, and, former, belgian, foreign, minister, called, leopold, ii, a, visionary, hero, according, to, michel, to, use, the, word, genocide, in, relation, to, the, congo, is, absolutely, unacceptable, and, inappropriate, maybe, colonisation, was, domineering, and, acquiring, more, power, but, at, a, certain, moment, it, brought, civilisation, michel, s, remarks, were, countered, by, several, belgian, politicians, senator, pol, van, den, driessche, replied, great, visionary, absolutely, not, what, happened, then, was, shameful, if, we, measured, him, against, 21st, century, standards, it, is, likely, that, leopold, would, be, hauled, before, the, international, criminal, court, in, the, hague, in, june, 2020, a, black, lives, matter, demonstration, in, brussels, protested, the, murder, of, george, floyd, causing, leopold, ii, s, legacy, to, become, once, again, the, subject, of, debate, mps, agreed, to, set, up, a, parliamentary, commission, to, examine, belgium, s, colonial, past, a,

cruelty, committed, in, the, congo, during, colonisation, but, did, not, explicitly, mention, leopold, s, role, in, the, atrocities, some, activists, accused, him, of, not, making, a, full, apology, leopold, ii, remains, a, controversial, figure, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, the, capital, kinshasa, known, until, 1966, as, leopoldville, in, his, honor, his, statue, was, removed, after, independence, congolese, culture, minister, christophe, muzungu, decided, to, reinstate, the, statue, in, 2005, he, noted, that, the, beginning, of, the, free, state, had, been, a, time, of, some, economic, and, social, progress, he, argued, that, people, should, recognize, some, positive, aspects, of, the, king, as, well, as, the, negative, but, hours, after, the, six, metre, 20, ft, statue, was, erected, near, kinshasa, s, central, station, it, was, officially, removed, several, statues, have, been, erected, to, honour, the, legacy, of, leopold, ii, in, belgium, according, to, professor, of, colonial, history, idesbald, goddeeris, of, the, university, of, leuven, 2018, most, of, the, statues, date, from, the, interwar, period, the, peak, of, colonial, patriotic, propaganda, the, monuments, were, supposed, to, help, get, rid, of, the, scandal, after, international, commotion, about, the, atrocities, in, the, congo, free, state, during, leopold, ii, s, rule, and, to, raise, people, s, enthusiasm, for, the, colonial, enterprise, in, belgian, congo, leopold, s, controversial, regime, in, the, congo, free, state, has, motivated, proposals, for, these, statues, to, be, removed, during, the, international, george, floyd, protests, against, racism, may, july, 2020, several, statues, of, leopold, ii, were, vandalised, and, petitions, calling,
