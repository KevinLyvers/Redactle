john, singer, sargent, s, r, d, n, t, january, 12, 1856, april, 14, 1925, was, an, american, expatriate, artist, considered, the, leading, portrait, painter, of, his, generation, for, his, evocations, of, edwardian, era, luxury, he, created, roughly, 900, oil, paintings, and, more, than, 2, 000, watercolors, as, well, as, countless, sketches, and, charcoal, drawings, his, oeuvre, documents, worldwide, travel, from, venice, to, the, tyrol, corfu, spain, the, middle, east, montana, maine, and, florida, born, in, florence, to, american, parents, he, was, trained, in, paris, before, moving, to, london, living, most, of, his, life, in, europe, he, enjoyed, international, acclaim, as, a, portrait, painter, an, early, submission, to, the, paris, salon, in, the, 1880s, his, portrait, of, madame, x, was, intended, to, consolidate, his, position, as, a, society, painter, in, paris, but, instead, resulted, in, scandal, during, the, year, following, the, scandal, sargent, departed, for, england, where, he, continued, a, successful, career, as, a, portrait, artist, from, the, beginning, sargent, s, work, is, characterized, by, remarkable, technical, facility, particularly, in, his, ability, to, draw, with, a, brush, which, in, later, years, inspired, admiration, as, well, as, criticism, for, its, supposed, superficiality, his, commissioned, works, were, consistent, with, the, grand, manner, of, portraiture, while, his, informal, studies, and, landscape, paintings, displayed, a, familiarity, with, impressionism, in, later, life, sargent, expressed, ambivalence, about, the, restrictions, of, formal, portrait, work, and, devoted, much, of, his, energy, to, mural, painting, and, working, en, plein, air, art, historians, generally, ignored, society, artists, such, as, sargent, until, the, late, 20th, century, the, exhibition, in, the, 1980s, of, sargent, s, previously, hidden, male, nudes, served, to, spark, a, reevaluation, of, his, life, and, work, and, its, psychological, complexity, in, addition, to, the, beauty, sensation, and, innovation, of, his, oeuvre, his, same, sex, interests, unconventional, friendships, with, women, and, engagement, with, race, gender, nonconformity, and, emerging, globalism, are, now, viewed, as, socially, and, aesthetically, progressive, and, radical, sargent, was, a, descendant, of, epes, sargent, a, colonial, military, leader, and, jurist, before, john, singer, sargent, s, birth, his, father, fitzwilliam, b, 1820, in, gloucester, massachusetts, was, an, eye, surgeon, at, the, wills, eye, hospital, in, philadelphia, from, 1844, to, 1854, after, john, s, older, sister, died, at, the, age, of, two, his, mother, mary, newbold, sargent, n, e, singer, 1826, 1906, suffered, a, breakdown, and, the, couple, decided, to, go, abroad, to, recover, they, remained, nomadic, expatriates, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, although, based, in, paris, sargent, s, parents, moved, regularly, spending, seasons, at, the, sea, and, at, mountain, resorts, in, france, germany, italy, and, switzerland, while, mary, was, pregnant, they, stopped, in, florence, tuscany, because, of, a, cholera, epidemic, sargent, was, born, there, in, 1856, a, year, later, his, sister, mary, was, born, after, her, birth, fitzwilliam, reluctantly, resigned, his, post, in, philadelphia, and, accepted, his, wife, s, request, to, remain, abroad, they, lived, modestly, on, a, small, inheritance, and, savings, leading, a, quiet, life, with, their, children, they, generally, avoided, society, and, other, americans, except, for, friends, in, the, art, world, four, more, children, were, born, abroad, of, whom, only, two, lived, past, childhood, although, his, father, was, a, patient, teacher, of, basic, subjects, young, sargent, was, a, rambunctious, child, more, interested, in, outdoor, activities, than, his, studies, as, his, father, wrote, home, he, is, quite, a, close, observer, of, animated, nature, his, mother, was, convinced, that, traveling, around, europe, and, visiting, museums, and, churches, would, give, young, sargent, a, satisfactory, education, several, attempts, to, have, him, formally, schooled, failed, owing, mostly, to, their, itinerant, life, his, mother, was, a, capable, amateur, artist, and, his, father, was, a, skilled, medical, illustrator, early, on, she, gave, him, sketchbooks, and, encouraged, drawing, excursions, sargent, worked, on, his, drawings, and, he, enthusiastically, copied, images, from, the, illustrated, london, news, of, ships, and, made, detailed, sketches, of, landscapes, fitzwilliam, had, hoped, that, his, son, s, interest, in, ships, and, the, sea, might, lead, him, toward, a, naval, career, at, thirteen, his, mother, reported, that, john, sketches, quite, nicely, has, a, remarkably, quick, and, correct, eye, if, we, could, afford, to, give, him, really, good, lessons, he, would, soon, be, quite, a, little, artist, at, the, age, of, thirteen, he, received, some, watercolor, lessons, from, carl, welsch, a, german, landscape, painter, although, his, education, was, far, from, complete, sargent, grew, up, to, be, a, highly, literate, and, cosmopolitan, young, man, accomplished, in, art, music, and, literature, he, was, fluent, in, english, french, italian, and, german, at, seventeen, sargent, was, described, as, willful, curious, determined, and, strong, after, his, mother, yet, shy, generous, and, modest, after, his, father, he, was, well, acquainted, with, many, of, the, great, masters, from, first, hand, observation, as, he, wrote, in, 1874, i, have, learned, in, venice, to, admire, tintoretto, immensely, and, to, consider, him, perhaps, second, only, to, michelangelo, and, titian, an, attempt, to, study, at, the, academy, of, florence, failed, as, the, school, was, reorganizing, at, the, time, after, returning, to, paris, from, florence, sargent, began, his, art, studies, with, the, young, french, portraitist, carolus, duran, following, a, meteoric, rise, the, artist, was, noted, for, his, bold, technique, and, modern, teaching, methods, his, influence, would, be, pivotal, to, sargent, during, the, period, from, 1874, to, 1878, in, 1874, sargent, passed, on, his, first, attempt, the, rigorous, exam, required, to, gain, admission, to, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, the, premier, art, school, in, france, he, took, drawing, classes, which, included, anatomy, and, perspective, and, gained, a, silver, prize, he, also, spent, much, time, in, self, study, drawing, in, museums, and, painting, in, a, studio, he, shared, with, james, carroll, beckwith, he, became, both, a, valuable, friend, and, sargent, s, primary, connection, with, the, american, artists, abroad, sargent, also, took, some, lessons, from, l, on, bonnat, carolus, duran, s, atelier, was, progressive, dispensing, with, the, traditional, academic, approach, which, required, careful, drawing, and, underpainting, in, favor, of, the, alla, prima, method, of, working, directly, on, the, canvas, with, a, loaded, brush, derived, from, diego, vel, zquez, it, was, an, approach, that, relied, on, the, proper, placement, of, tones, of, paint, sargent, would, later, create, a, painting, in, this, style, that, prompted, comments, such, as, the, student, has, surpassed, the, teacher, this, approach, also, permitted, spontaneous, flourishes, of, color, not, bound, to, an, underdrawing, it, was, markedly, different, from, the, traditional, atelier, of, jean, l, on, g, r, me, where, americans, thomas, eakins, and, julian, alden, weir, had, studied, sargent, was, the, star, student, in, short, order, weir, met, sargent, in, 1874, and, noted, that, sargent, was, one, of, the, most, talented, fellows, i, have, ever, come, across, his, drawings, are, like, the, old, masters, and, his, color, is, equally, fine, sargent, s, excellent, command, of, french, and, his, superior, talent, made, him, both, popular, and, admired, through, his, friendship, with, paul, c, sar, helleu, sargent, would, meet, giants, of, the, art, world, including, degas, rodin, monet, and, whistler, sargent, s, early, enthusiasm, was, for, landscapes, not, portraiture, as, evidenced, by, his, voluminous, sketches, full, of, mountains, seascapes, and, buildings, carolus, duran, s, expertise, in, portraiture, finally, influenced, sargent, in, that, direction, commissions, for, history, paintings, were, still, considered, more, prestigious, but, were, much, harder, to, get, portrait, painting, on, the, other, hand, was, the, best, way, of, promoting, an, art, career, getting, exhibited, in, the, salon, and, gaining, commissions, to, earn, a, livelihood, sargent, s, first, major, portrait, was, of, his, friend, fanny, watts, in, 1877, and, was, also, his, first, salon, admission, its, particularly, well, executed, pose, drew, attention, his, second, salon, entry, was, the, oyster, gatherers, of, can, ale, an, impressionistic, painting, of, which, he, made, two, copies, one, of, which, he, sent, back, to, the, united, states, and, both, received, warm, reviews, in, 1879, at, the, age, of, 23, sargent, painted, a, portrait, of, his, teacher, carolus, duran, the, virtuoso, effort, met, with, public, approval, and, announced, the, direction, his, mature, work, would, take, its, showing, at, the, paris, salon, was, both, a, tribute, to, his, teacher, and, an, advertisement, for, portrait, commissions, of, sargent, s, early, work, henry, james, wrote, that, the, artist, offered, the, slightly, uncanny, spectacle, of, a, talent, which, on, the, very, threshold, of, its, career, has, nothing, more, to, learn, after, leaving, carolus, duran, s, atelier, sargent, visited, spain, there, he, studied, the, paintings, of, vel, zquez, with, a, passion, absorbing, the, master, s, technique, and, in, his, travels, gathered, ideas, for, future, works, he, was, entranced, with, spanish, music, and, dance, the, trip, also, re, awakened, his, own, talent, for, music, which, was, nearly, equal, to, his, artistic, talent, and, which, found, visual, expression, in, his, early, masterpiece, el, jaleo, 1882, music, would, continue, to, play, a, major, part, in, his, social, life, as, well, as, he, was, a, skillful, accompanist, of, both, amateur, and, professional, musicians, sargent, became, a, strong, advocate, for, modern, composers, especially, gabriel, faur, trips, to, italy, provided, sketches, and, ideas, for, several, venetian, street, scene, genre, paintings, which, effectively, captured, gestures, and, postures, he, would, find, useful, in, later, portraiture, upon, his, return, to, paris, sargent, quickly, received, several, portrait, commissions, his, career, was, launched, he, immediately, demonstrated, the, concentration, and, stamina, that, enabled, him, to, paint, with, workman, like, steadiness, for, the, next, twenty, five, years, he, filled, in, the, gaps, between, commissions, with, many, non, commissioned, portraits, of, friends, and, colleagues, his, fine, manners, perfect, french, and, great, skill, made, him, a, standout, among, the, newer, portraitists, and, his, fame, quickly, spread, he, confidently, set, high, prices, and, turned, down, unsatisfactory, sitters, he, mentored, his, friend, emil, fuchs, who, was, learning, to, paint, portraits, in, oils, in, the, early, 1880s, sargent, regularly, exhibited, portraits, at, the, salon, and, these, were, mostly, full, length, portrayals, of, women, such, as, madame, edouard, pailleron, 1880, done, en, plein, air, and, madame, ram, n, subercaseaux, 1881, he, continued, to, receive, positive, critical, notice, sargent, s, best, portraits, reveal, the, individuality, and, personality, of, the, sitters, his, most, ardent, admirers, think, he, is, matched, in, this, only, by, vel, zquez, who, was, one, of, sargent, s, great, influences, the, spanish, master, s, spell, is, apparent, in, sargent, s, the, daughters, of, edward, darley, boit, 1882, a, haunting, interior, that, echoes, vel, zquez, s, las, meninas, as, in, many, of, his, early, portraits, sargent, confidently, tries, different, approaches, with, each, new, challenge, here, employing, both, unusual, composition, and, lighting, to, striking, effect, one, of, his, most, widely, exhibited, and, best, loved, works, of, the, 1880s, was, lady, with, the, rose, 1882, a, portrait, of, charlotte, burckhardt, a, close, friend, and, possible, romantic, attachment, his, most, controversial, work, portrait, of, madame, x, madame, pierre, gautreau, 1884, is, now, considered, one, of, his, best, works, and, was, his, favorite, he, stated, in, 1915, i, suppose, it, is, the, best, thing, i, have, done, when, unveiled, in, paris, at, the, 1884, salon, it, aroused, such, a, negative, reaction, that, it, likely, prompted, sargent, s, move, to, london, sargent, s, self, confidence, had, led, him, to, attempt, a, risqu, experiment, in, portraiture, but, this, time, it, unexpectedly, backfired, the, painting, was, not, commissioned, by, her, and, he, pursued, her, for, the, opportunity, quite, unlike, most, of, his, portrait, work, where, clients, sought, him, out, sargent, wrote, to, a, common, acquaintance, i, have, a, great, desire, to, paint, her, portrait, and, have, reason, to, think, she, would, allow, it, and, is, waiting, for, someone, to, propose, this, homage, to, her, beauty, you, might, tell, her, that, i, am, a, man, of, prodigious, talent, it, took, well, over, a, year, to, complete, the, painting, the, first, version, of, the, portrait, of, madame, gautreau, with, the, famously, plunging, neckline, white, powdered, skin, and, arrogantly, cocked, head, featured, an, intentionally, suggestive, off, the, shoulder, dress, strap, on, her, right, side, only, which, made, the, overall, effect, more, daring, and, sensual, sargent, repainted, the, strap, to, its, expected, over, the, shoulder, position, to, try, to, dampen, the, furor, but, the, damage, had, been, done, french, commissions, dried, up, and, he, told, his, friend, edmund, gosse, in, 1885, that, he, contemplated, giving, up, painting, for, music, or, business, writing, of, the, reaction, of, visitors, judith, gautier, observed, is, it, a, woman, a, chimera, the, figure, of, a, unicorn, rearing, as, on, a, heraldic, coat, of, arms, or, perhaps, the, work, of, some, oriental, decorative, artist, to, whom, the, human, form, is, forbidden, and, who, wishing, to, be, reminded, of, woman, has, drawn, the, delicious, arabesque, no, it, is, none, of, these, things, but, rather, the, precise, image, of, a, modern, woman, scrupulously, drawn, by, a, painter, who, is, a, master, of, his, art, prior, to, the, madame, x, scandal, of, 1884, sargent, had, painted, exotic, beauties, such, as, rosina, ferrara, of, capri, and, the, spanish, expatriate, model, carmela, bertagna, but, the, earlier, pictures, had, not, been, intended, for, broad, public, reception, sargent, kept, the, painting, prominently, displayed, in, his, london, studio, until, he, sold, it, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, 1916, after, moving, to, the, united, states, and, a, few, months, after, gautreau, s, death, before, arriving, in, england, sargent, began, sending, paintings, for, exhibition, at, the, royal, academy, these, included, the, portraits, of, dr, pozzi, at, home, 1881, a, flamboyant, essay, in, red, and, his, first, full, length, male, portrait, and, the, more, traditional, mrs, henry, white, 1883, the, ensuing, portrait, commissions, encouraged, sargent, to, complete, his, move, to, london, in, 1886, where, he, settled, in, the, artistic, community, of, chelsea, notwithstanding, the, madame, x, scandal, he, had, considered, moving, to, london, as, early, as, 1882, he, had, been, urged, to, do, so, repeatedly, by, his, new, friend, the, novelist, henry, james, in, retrospect, his, transfer, to, london, may, be, seen, to, have, been, inevitable, english, critics, were, not, warm, at, first, faulting, sargent, for, his, clever, frenchified, handling, of, paint, one, reviewer, seeing, his, portrait, of, mrs, henry, white, described, his, technique, as, hard, and, almost, metallic, with, no, taste, in, expression, air, or, modeling, with, help, from, mrs, white, however, sargent, soon, gained, the, admiration, of, english, patrons, and, critics, henry, james, also, gave, the, artist, a, push, to, the, best, of, my, ability, sargent, spent, much, time, painting, outdoors, in, the, english, countryside, when, not, in, his, studio, on, a, visit, to, monet, at, giverny, in, 1885, sargent, painted, one, of, his, most, impressionistic, portraits, of, monet, at, work, painting, outdoors, with, his, new, bride, nearby, sargent, is, usually, not, thought, of, as, an, impressionist, painter, but, he, sometimes, used, impressionistic, techniques, to, great, effect, his, claude, monet, painting, at, the, edge, of, a, wood, is, rendered, in, his, own, version, of, the, impressionist, style, in, the, 1880s, he, attended, the, impressionist, exhibitions, and, he, began, to, paint, outdoors, in, the, plein, air, manner, after, that, visit, to, monet, sargent, purchased, four, monet, works, for, his, personal, collection, during, that, time, sargent, was, similarly, inspired, to, do, a, portrait, of, his, artist, friend, paul, c, sar, helleu, also, painting, outdoors, with, his, wife, by, his, side, a, photograph, very, similar, to, the, painting, suggests, that, sargent, occasionally, used, photography, as, an, aid, to, composition, through, helleu, sargent, met, and, painted, the, famed, french, sculptor, auguste, rodin, in, 1884, a, rather, somber, portrait, reminiscent, of, works, by, thomas, eakins, although, the, british, critics, classified, sargent, in, the, impressionist, camp, the, french, impressionists, thought, otherwise, as, monet, later, stated, he, is, not, an, impressionist, in, the, sense, that, we, use, the, word, he, is, too, much, under, the, influence, of, carolus, duran, sargent, s, first, major, success, at, the, royal, academy, of, arts, came, in, 1887, with, the, enthusiastic, response, to, carnation, lily, lily, rose, a, large, piece, painted, on, site, of, two, young, girls, lighting, lanterns, in, an, english, garden, in, broadway, in, the, cotswolds, the, painting, was, immediately, purchased, by, the, tate, gallery, his, first, trip, to, new, york, and, boston, as, a, professional, artist, in, 1887, 88, produced, over, 20, important, commissions, including, portraits, of, isabella, stewart, gardner, the, famed, boston, art, patron, his, portrait, of, mrs, adrian, iselin, wife, of, a, new, york, businessman, revealed, her, character, in, one, of, his, most, insightful, works, in, boston, sargent, was, honored, with, his, first, solo, exhibition, which, presented, 22, of, his, paintings, here, he, became, friends, with, painter, dennis, miller, bunker, who, traveled, to, england, in, the, summer, of, 1888, to, paint, with, him, en, plein, air, and, is, the, subject, of, sargent, s, 1888, painting, dennis, miller, bunker, painting, at, calcot, back, in, london, sargent, was, quickly, busy, again, his, working, methods, were, by, then, well, established, following, many, of, the, steps, employed, by, other, master, portrait, painters, before, him, after, securing, a, commission, through, negotiations, which, he, carried, out, sargent, would, visit, the, client, s, home, to, see, where, the, painting, was, to, hang, he, would, often, review, a, client, s, wardrobe, to, pick, suitable, attire, some, portraits, were, done, in, the, client, s, home, but, more, often, in, his, studio, which, was, well, stocked, with, furniture, and, background, materials, he, chose, for, proper, effect, he, usually, required, eight, to, ten, sittings, from, his, clients, although, he, would, try, to, capture, the, face, in, one, sitting, he, usually, kept, up, pleasant, conversation, and, sometimes, he, would, take, a, break, and, play, the, piano, for, his, sitter, sargent, seldom, used, pencil, or, oil, sketches, and, instead, laid, down, oil, paint, directly, finally, he, would, select, an, appropriate, frame, sargent, had, no, assistants, he, handled, all, the, tasks, such, as, preparing, his, canvases, varnishing, the, painting, arranging, for, photography, shipping, and, documentation, he, commanded, about, 5, 000, per, portrait, or, about, 130, 000, in, current, dollars, some, american, clients, traveled, to, london, at, their, own, expense, to, have, sargent, paint, their, portrait, the, range, of, pigments, regularly, used, by, sargent, was, mars, yellow, a, synthetic, iron, oxide, and, cadmium, yellow, viridian, and, emerald, green, sometimes, mixed, vermillion, and, mars, red, both, alone, and, mixed, madder, synthetic, ultramarine, or, cobalt, blue, and, ivory, black, sienna, and, mars, brown, around, 1890, sargent, painted, two, daring, non, commissioned, portraits, as, show, pieces, one, of, actress, ellen, terry, as, lady, macbeth, and, one, of, the, popular, spanish, dancer, la, carmencita, sargent, was, elected, an, associate, of, the, royal, academy, and, was, made, a, full, member, three, years, later, in, the, 1890s, he, averaged, fourteen, portrait, commissions, per, year, none, more, beautiful, than, the, genteel, lady, agnew, of, lochnaw, 1892, his, portrait, of, mrs, hugh, hammersley, mrs, hugh, hammersley, 1892, was, equally, well, received, for, its, lively, depiction, of, one, of, london, s, most, notable, hostesses, as, a, portrait, painter, in, the, grand, manner, sargent, had, unmatched, success, he, portrayed, subjects, who, were, at, once, ennobled, and, often, possessed, of, nervous, energy, sargent, was, referred, to, as, the, van, dyck, of, our, times, although, sargent, was, an, american, expatriate, he, returned, to, the, united, states, many, times, often, to, answer, the, demand, for, commissioned, portraits, sargent, exhibited, nine, of, his, portraits, in, the, palace, of, fine, arts, at, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, in, chicago, sargent, painted, a, series, of, three, portraits, of, robert, louis, stevenson, the, second, portrait, of, robert, louis, stevenson, and, his, wife, 1885, was, one, of, his, best, known, he, also, completed, portraits, of, two, u, s, presidents, theodore, roosevelt, and, woodrow, wilson, in, 1896, the, trustees, of, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, commissioned, sargent, to, produce, a, portrait, of, henry, gurdon, marquand, marquand, served, as, the, second, president, of, the, museum, and, was, instrumental, in, its, founding, in, 1888, sargent, released, his, portrait, of, alice, vanderbilt, shepard, great, granddaughter, of, cornelius, vanderbilt, many, of, his, most, important, works, are, in, museums, in, the, united, states, in, 1897, a, friend, sponsored, a, famous, portrait, in, oil, of, mr, and, mrs, i, n, phelps, stokes, by, sargent, as, a, wedding, gift, jean, zimmerman, documents, the, creation, of, the, stokes, portrait, in, her, dual, biography, of, the, couple, love, fiercely, in, 1898, asher, wertheimer, a, wealthy, jewish, art, dealer, living, in, london, commissioned, from, sargent, a, series, of, a, dozen, portraits, of, his, family, the, artist, s, largest, commission, from, a, single, patron, the, wertheimer, portraits, reveal, a, pleasant, familiarity, between, the, artist, and, his, subjects, even, though, wertheimer, bequeathed, most, of, the, paintings, to, the, national, gallery, nowadays, they, are, on, display, at, the, tate, britain, by, 1900, sargent, was, at, the, height, of, his, fame, cartoonist, max, beerbohm, completed, one, of, his, seventeen, caricatures, of, sargent, making, well, known, to, the, public, the, artist, s, paunchy, physique, although, only, in, his, forties, sargent, began, to, travel, more, and, to, devote, relatively, less, time, to, portrait, painting, his, an, interior, in, venice, 1900, a, portrait, of, four, members, of, the, curtis, family, in, their, elegant, palatial, home, palazzo, barbaro, was, a, resounding, success, but, whistler, did, not, approve, of, the, looseness, of, sargent, s, brushwork, which, he, summed, up, as, smudge, everywhere, one, of, sargent, s, last, major, portraits, in, his, bravura, style, was, that, of, lord, ribblesdale, in, 1902, finely, attired, in, an, elegant, hunting, uniform, between, 1900, and, 1907, sargent, continued, his, high, productivity, which, included, in, addition, to, dozens, of, oil, portraits, hundreds, of, portrait, drawings, at, about, 400, each, in, 1901, he, purchased, the, next, door, property, to, his, home, in, tite, street, to, create, a, larger, studio, in, 1907, at, the, age, of, fifty, one, sargent, officially, closed, his, studio, relieved, he, stated, painting, a, portrait, would, be, quite, amusing, if, one, were, not, forced, to, talk, while, working, what, a, nuisance, having, to, entertain, the, sitter, and, to, look, happy, when, one, feels, wretched, in, that, same, year, sargent, painted, his, modest, and, serious, self, portrait, his, last, for, the, celebrated, self, portrait, collection, of, the, uffizi, gallery, in, florence, italy, sargent, made, several, summer, visits, to, the, swiss, alps, with, his, sisters, emily, sargent, an, accomplished, painter, in, her, own, right, and, violet, sargent, mrs, ormond, and, also, violet, s, daughters, rose, marie, and, reine, who, were, the, subject, of, a, number, of, paintings, between, 1906, and, 1913, like, the, black, brook, 1908, or, nonchaloir, repose, 1911, by, the, time, sargent, finished, his, portrait, of, john, d, rockefeller, in, 1917, most, critics, began, to, consign, him, to, the, masters, of, the, past, a, brilliant, ambassador, between, his, patrons, and, posterity, modernists, treated, him, more, harshly, considering, him, completely, out, of, touch, with, the, reality, of, american, life, and, with, emerging, artistic, trends, including, cubism, and, futurism, sargent, quietly, accepted, the, criticism, but, refused, to, alter, his, negative, opinions, of, modern, art, he, retorted, ingres, raphael, and, el, greco, these, are, now, my, admirations, these, are, what, i, like, sometime, between, 1917, and, 1920, sargent, painted, the, portrait, of, thomas, e, mckeller, a, young, african, american, elevator, operator, and, wwi, veteran, the, canvas, was, kept, in, the, painter, s, studio, until, his, death, and, only, began, to, be, displayed, permanently, to, the, public, in, 1986, when, it, was, acquired, by, the, museum, of, fine, arts, in, boston, mckeller, also, posed, as, a, model, for, the, mythological, murals, that, sargent, painted, at, the, stairway, and, the, rotunda, of, the, mfa, boston, and, for, the, world, war, i, memorial, murals, at, harvard, s, widener, library, in, 1925, shortly, before, he, died, sargent, painted, his, last, oil, portrait, a, canvas, of, aristocrat, grace, curzon, marchioness, curzon, of, kedleston, the, painting, was, purchased, in, 1936, by, the, currier, museum, of, art, in, manchester, new, hampshire, where, it, has, been, on, display, since, then, media, related, to, watercolor, paintings, by, john, singer, sargent, at, wikimedia, commons, during, sargent, s, long, career, he, painted, more, than, 2, 000, watercolors, roving, from, the, english, countryside, to, venice, to, the, tyrol, corfu, the, middle, east, montana, maine, and, florida, each, destination, offered, pictorial, stimulation, and, treasure, even, at, his, leisure, in, escaping, the, pressures, of, the, portrait, studio, he, painted, with, restless, intensity, often, painting, from, morning, until, night, his, hundreds, of, watercolors, of, venice, are, especially, notable, many, done, from, the, perspective, of, a, gondola, his, colors, were, sometimes, extremely, vivid, and, as, one, reviewer, noted, everything, is, given, with, the, intensity, of, a, dream, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, sargent, painted, bedouins, goatherds, and, fishermen, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, he, produced, many, watercolors, in, maine, florida, and, in, the, american, west, of, fauna, flora, and, native, peoples, with, his, watercolors, sargent, was, able, to, indulge, his, earliest, artistic, inclinations, for, nature, architecture, exotic, peoples, and, noble, mountain, landscapes, and, it, is, in, some, of, his, late, works, where, one, senses, sargent, painting, most, purely, for, himself, his, watercolors, were, executed, with, a, joyful, fluidness, he, also, painted, extensively, family, friends, gardens, and, fountains, in, watercolors, he, playfully, portrayed, his, friends, and, family, dressed, in, orientalist, costume, relaxing, in, brightly, lit, landscapes, that, allowed, for, a, more, vivid, palette, and, experimental, handling, than, did, his, commissions, the, chess, game, 1906, his, first, major, solo, exhibit, of, watercolor, works, was, at, the, carfax, gallery, in, london, in, 1905, in, 1909, he, exhibited, eighty, six, watercolors, in, new, york, city, eighty, three, of, which, were, bought, by, the, brooklyn, museum, evan, charteris, wrote, in, 1927, to, live, with, sargent, s, water, colours, is, to, live, with, sunshine, captured, and, held, with, the, luster, of, a, bright, and, legible, world, the, refluent, shade, and, the, ambient, ardours, of, the, noon, although, not, generally, accorded, the, critical, respect, given, winslow, homer, perhaps, america, s, greatest, watercolorist, scholarship, has, revealed, that, sargent, was, fluent, in, the, entire, range, of, opaque, and, transparent, watercolor, technique, including, the, methods, used, by, homer, as, a, concession, to, the, insatiable, demand, of, wealthy, patrons, for, portraits, sargent, dashed, off, hundreds, of, rapid, charcoal, portrait, sketches, which, he, called, mugs, forty, six, of, these, spanning, the, years, 1890, 1916, were, exhibited, at, the, royal, society, of, portrait, painters, in, 1916, all, of, sargent, s, murals, are, to, be, found, in, the, boston, cambridge, area, in, massachusetts, they, are, in, the, boston, public, library, the, museum, of, fine, arts, and, harvard, s, widener, library, sargent, s, largest, scale, works, are, the, mural, decorations, triumph, of, religion, that, grace, the, boston, public, library, depicting, the, history, of, religion, and, the, gods, of, polytheism, they, were, attached, to, the, walls, of, the, library, by, means, of, marouflage, he, worked, on, the, cycle, for, almost, thirty, years, but, never, completed, the, final, mural, sargent, drew, on, his, extensive, travels, and, museum, visits, to, create, a, dense, art, historical, m, lange, the, murals, were, most, recently, restored, in, 2003, 2004, by, a, team, from, the, straus, center, for, conservation, and, technical, studies, harvard, art, museums, sargent, worked, on, the, murals, from, 1895, through, 1919, they, were, intended, to, show, religion, s, and, society, s, progress, from, pagan, superstition, up, through, the, ascension, of, christianity, concluding, with, a, painting, depicting, jesus, delivering, the, sermon, on, the, mount, but, sargent, s, paintings, of, the, church, and, the, synagogue, installed, in, late, 1919, inspired, a, debate, about, whether, the, artist, had, represented, judaism, in, a, stereotypical, or, even, an, anti, semitic, manner, drawing, upon, iconography, that, was, used, in, medieval, paintings, sargent, portrayed, judaism, and, the, synagogue, as, a, blind, ugly, hag, and, christianity, and, the, church, as, a, lovely, radiant, young, woman, he, also, failed, to, understand, how, these, representations, might, be, problematic, for, the, jews, of, boston, he, was, both, surprised, and, hurt, when, the, paintings, were, criticized, the, paintings, were, objectionable, to, boston, jews, since, they, seemed, to, show, judaism, defeated, and, christianity, triumphant, the, boston, newspapers, also, followed, the, controversy, noting, that, while, many, found, the, paintings, offensive, not, everyone, agreed, in, the, end, sargent, abandoned, his, plan, to, finish, the, murals, and, the, controversy, eventually, died, down, upon, his, return, to, england, in, 1918, after, a, visit, to, the, united, states, sargent, was, commissioned, as, a, war, artist, by, the, british, ministry, of, information, in, his, large, painting, gassed, and, in, many, watercolors, he, depicted, scenes, from, the, great, war, sargent, had, been, affected, by, the, death, of, his, niece, rose, marie, in, the, shelling, of, the, st, gervais, church, paris, on, good, friday, 1918, sargent, was, a, life, long, bachelor, with, a, wide, circle, of, friends, including, oscar, wilde, with, whom, he, was, neighbors, for, several, years, gay, author, violet, paget, and, his, likely, lover, albert, de, belleroche, biographers, once, portrayed, him, as, staid, and, reticent, however, recent, scholarship, has, theorised, he, was, a, private, complex, and, passionate, man, whose, homosexual, identity, was, integral, to, shaping, his, art, this, view, is, based, on, statements, by, his, friends, and, associates, the, general, alluring, remoteness, of, his, portraits, the, way, his, works, challenge, 19th, century, notions, of, gender, difference, his, previously, ignored, male, nudes, and, some, male, portraits, including, those, of, thomas, e, mckeller, bartholomy, maganosco, olimpio, fusco, and, that, of, aristocratic, artist, albert, de, belleroche, which, hung, in, his, chelsea, dining, room, sargent, had, a, long, friendship, with, belleroche, whom, he, met, in, 1882, and, traveled, with, frequently, a, surviving, drawing, suggests, sargent, might, have, used, him, as, a, model, for, madame, x, following, a, coincidence, of, dates, for, sargent, drawing, each, of, them, separately, around, the, same, time, and, the, delicate, pose, suggestive, more, of, sargent, s, sketches, of, the, male, form, than, his, often, stiff, commissions, it, has, been, suggested, that, sargent, s, reputation, in, the, 1890s, as, the, painter, of, the, jews, may, have, been, due, to, his, empathy, with, and, complicit, enjoyment, of, their, mutual, social, foreignness, one, such, jewish, client, betty, wertheimer, wrote, that, when, in, venice, sargent, was, only, interested, in, the, venetian, gondoliers, the, painter, jacques, mile, blanche, who, was, one, of, his, early, sitters, said, after, sargent, s, death, that, his, sex, life, was, notorious, in, paris, and, in, venice, positively, scandalous, he, was, a, frenzied, bugger, he, had, many, relationships, with, women, it, has, been, suggested, that, those, with, his, sitters, rosina, ferrara, virginie, gautreau, and, judith, gautier, may, have, tipped, into, infatuation, as, a, young, man, sargent, also, for, a, time, courted, louise, burkhardt, the, model, for, lady, with, the, rose, sargent, s, friends, and, supporters, included, henry, james, and, isabella, stewart, gardner, of, both, of, whom, he, painted, portraits, and, gardner, also, commissioned, and, purchased, works, from, sargent, and, sought, his, advice, on, other, acquisitions, edward, vii, and, paul, c, sar, helleu, were, also, friends, and, supporters, of, sargent, his, associations, also, included, prince, edmond, de, polignac, and, count, robert, de, montesquiou, other, artists, sargent, associated, with, were, dennis, miller, bunker, james, carroll, beckwith, edwin, austin, abbey, and, john, elliott, who, also, worked, on, the, boston, public, library, murals, francis, david, millet, joaqu, n, sorolla, and, claude, monet, whom, sargent, portrayed, with, monet, s, wife, by, the, edge, of, a, wood, between, 1905, and, 1914, sargent, s, frequent, traveling, companions, were, the, married, artist, couple, wilfrid, de, glehn, and, jane, emmet, de, glehn, the, trio, would, often, spend, summers, in, france, spain, or, italy, and, all, three, would, depict, one, another, in, their, paintings, during, their, travels, in, a, time, when, the, art, world, focused, in, turn, on, impressionism, fauvism, and, cubism, sargent, practiced, his, own, form, of, realism, which, made, brilliant, references, to, vel, zquez, van, dyck, and, gainsborough, his, seemingly, effortless, facility, for, paraphrasing, the, masters, in, a, contemporary, fashion, led, to, a, stream, of, commissioned, portraits, of, remarkable, virtuosity, ars, ne, vigeant, 1885, mus, es, de, metz, mr, and, mrs, isaac, newton, phelps, stokes, 1897, metropolitan, museum, of, art, new, york, and, earned, sargent, the, moniker, the, van, dyck, of, our, times, in, 1916, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, degree, by, harvard, university, still, during, his, life, his, work, engendered, negative, responses, from, some, of, his, colleagues, camille, pissarro, wrote, he, is, not, an, enthusiast, but, rather, an, adroit, performer, and, walter, sickert, published, a, satirical, turn, under, the, heading, sargentolatry, by, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, dismissed, as, an, anachronism, a, relic, of, the, gilded, age, and, out, of, step, with, the, artistic, sentiments, of, post, world, war, i, europe, elizabeth, prettejohn, suggests, that, the, decline, of, sargent, s, reputation, was, due, partly, to, the, rise, of, anti, semitism, and, the, resultant, intolerance, of, celebrations, of, jewish, prosperity, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, exotic, qualities, inherent, in, his, work, appealed, to, the, sympathies, of, the, jewish, clients, whom, he, painted, from, the, 1890s, on, nowhere, is, this, more, apparent, than, in, his, portrait, almina, daughter, of, asher, wertheimer, 1908, in, which, the, subject, is, seen, wearing, a, persian, costume, a, pearl, encrusted, turban, and, strumming, an, indian, tambura, accoutrements, all, meant, to, convey, sensuality, and, mystery, if, sargent, used, this, portrait, to, explore, issues, of, sexuality, and, identity, it, seems, to, have, met, with, the, satisfaction, of, the, subject, s, father, asher, wertheimer, a, wealthy, jewish, art, dealer, foremost, of, sargent, s, detractors, was, the, influential, english, art, critic, roger, fry, of, the, bloomsbury, group, who, at, the, 1926, sargent, retrospective, in, london, dismissed, sargent, s, work, as, lacking, aesthetic, quality, wonderful, indeed, but, most, wonderful, that, this, wonderful, performance, should, ever, have, been, confused, with, that, of, an, artist, and, in, the, 1930s, lewis, mumford, led, a, chorus, of, the, severest, critics, sargent, remained, to, the, end, an, illustrator, the, most, adroit, appearance, of, workmanship, the, most, dashing, eye, for, effect, cannot, conceal, the, essential, emptiness, of, sargent, s, mind, or, the, contemptuous, and, cynical, superficiality, of, a, certain, part, of, his, execution, part, of, sargent, s, devaluation, is, also, attributed, to, his, expatriate, life, which, made, him, seem, less, american, at, a, time, when, authentic, socially, conscious, american, art, as, exemplified, by, the, stieglitz, circle, and, by, the, ashcan, school, was, on, the, ascent, after, such, a, long, period, of, critical, disfavor, sargent, s, reputation, has, increased, steadily, since, the, 1950s, in, the, 1960s, a, revival, of, victorian, art, and, new, scholarship, directed, at, sargent, strengthened, his, reputation, sargent, has, been, the, subject, of, large, scale, exhibitions, in, major, museums, including, a, retrospective, exhibition, at, the, whitney, museum, of, american, art, in, 1986, and, a, major, 1999, traveling, show, that, exhibited, at, the, museum, of, fine, arts, boston, the, national, gallery, of, art, washington, and,

sargent, s, paintings, from, spain, in, 1986, andy, warhol, commented, to, sargent, scholar, trevor, fairbrother, that, sargent, made, everybody, look, glamorous, taller, thinner, but, they, all, have, mood, every, one, of, them, has, a, different, mood, in, a, time, magazine, article, from, the, 1980s, critic, robert, hughes, praised, sargent, as, the, unrivaled, recorder, of, male, power, and, female, beauty, in, a, day, that, like, ours, paid, excessive, court, to, both, in, 1922, sargent, co, founded, new, york, city, s, grand, central, art, galleries, together, with, edmund,
