establish, a, historical, seminar, ranke, set, the, standards, for, much, of, later, historical, writing, introducing, such, ideas, as, reliance, on, primary, sources, empiricism, an, emphasis, on, narrative, history, and, especially, international, politics, au, enpolitik, he, was, ennobled, in, 1865, with, the, addition, of, a, von, to, his, name, ranke, also, had, a, great, influence, on, western, historiography, and, is, considered, a, symbol, of, the, quality, of, 19th, century, german, historical, studies, ranke, influenced, by, barthold, georg, niebuhr, was, very, talented, in, constructing, narratives, without, exceeding, the, limits, of, historical, evidence, his, critics, have, noted, the, influence, of, lutheranism, in, guiding, his, work, especially, his, belief, that, god, s, actions, were, manifest, in, the, lives, of, men, and, history, a, viewpoint, that, shaped, his, ideas, that, the, german, empire, was, a, manifestation, of, god, s, intent, ranke, was, born, in, wiehe, thuringia, saxony, wiehe, was, then, a, part, of, the, electorate, of, saxony, he, came, from, a, family, of, lutheran, pastors, and, lawyers, he, was, educated, partly, at, home, and, partly, in, the, high, school, at, schulpforta, his, early, years, engendered, a, lifelong, love, of, ancient, greek, latin, and, lutheranism, in, 1814, ranke, entered, leipzig, university, where, his, subjects, were, classics, and, lutheran, theology, at, leipzig, ranke, became, an, expert, in, philology, and, translation, of, the, ancient, authors, into, german, his, teachers, included, johann, gottfried, jakob, hermann, as, a, student, ranke, s, favorite, authors, were, thucydides, livy, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, barthold, georg, niebuhr, immanuel, kant, johann, gottlieb, fichte, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, and, friedrich, schlegel, ranke, showed, little, interest, in, the, work, of, modern, history, because, of, his, dissatisfaction, with, what, he, regarded, as, history, books, that, were, merely, a, collection, of, facts, lumped, together, by, modern, historians, between, 1817, and, 1825, ranke, worked, as, a, schoolmaster, teaching, classics, at, the, friedrichs, gymnasium, in, frankfurt, an, der, oder, during, this, time, he, became, interested, in, history, in, part, because, of, his, desire, to, be, involved, in, the, developing, field, of, a, more, professionalized, history, and, in, part, because, of, his, desire, to, find, the, hand, of, god, in, the, workings, of, history, in, 1824, ranke, launched, his, career, with, the, book, geschichten, der, romanischen, und, germanischen, v, lker, von, 1494, bis, 1514, histories, of, the, latin, and, teutonic, peoples, from, 1494, to, 1514, in, which, he, used, an, unusually, wide, variety, of, sources, for, a, historian, of, the, age, including, memoirs, diaries, personal, and, formal, missives, government, documents, diplomatic, dispatches, and, first, hand, accounts, of, eye, witnesses, in, that, sense, he, leaned, on, the, traditions, of, philology, but, emphasized, mundane, documents, instead, of, old, and, exotic, literature, after, the, minister, of, education, was, impressed, with, the, work, of, a, historian, who, did, not, have, access, to, the, nation, s, great, public, libraries, ranke, was, given, a, position, in, the, university, of, berlin, where, he, was, a, professor, for, nearly, fifty, years, starting, in, 1825, at, the, university, he, used, the, seminar, system, and, taught, how, to, check, the, value, of, sources, ranke, became, deeply, involved, in, the, dispute, between, the, followers, of, the, legal, professor, friedrich, carl, von, savigny, who, emphasized, the, varieties, of, different, periods, of, history, and, the, followers, of, the, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, who, saw, history, as, the, unfolding, of, a, universal, story, ranke, supported, savigny, and, criticized, the, hegelian, view, of, history, as, being, a, one, size, fits, all, approach, also, during, his, time, in, berlin, ranke, became, the, first, historian, to, use, the, forty, seven, volumes, that, comprised, the, diplomatic, archives, of, venice, from, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, since, many, archives, opened, up, during, this, time, he, sent, out, his, students, to, these, places, to, recruit, information, in, his, classrooms, he, would, discuss, the, sources, that, his, students, would, find, and, would, emphasize, that, history, should, be, told, the, way, it, happened, therefore, he, is, often, seen, as, the, pioneer, of, a, critical, historical, science, meanwhile, ranke, came, to, prefer, dealing, with, primary, sources, as, opposed, to, secondary, sources, it, was, in, vienna, where, the, friendship, of, friedrich, von, gentz, and, the, protection, of, klemens, von, metternich, opened, to, him, the, venetian, archives, a, fresh, source, the, value, of, which, he, first, discovered, it, is, still, not, exhausted, he, found, time, to, write, a, short, book, entitled, die, serbische, revolution, 1829, from, material, supplied, to, him, by, vuk, karad, i, a, serb, who, had, himself, been, witness, to, the, scenes, he, related, during, the, first, serbian, uprising, in, 1804, this, was, afterwards, expanded, into, serbien, und, die, turkei, im, 19, jahrhundert, 1879, defunct, at, the, behest, of, the, prussian, government, ranke, founded, and, edited, the, historische, politische, zeitschrift, journal, from, 1832, to, 1836, ranke, who, was, a, conservative, used, the, journal, to, attack, the, ideas, of, liberalism, in, his, 1833, article, the, great, powers, and, his, 1836, article, dialogue, on, politics, ranke, claimed, that, every, state, is, given, a, special, moral, character, from, god, and, individuals, should, strive, best, to, fulfill, the, idea, of, their, state, thus, in, this, way, ranke, urged, his, readers, to, stay, loyal, to, the, prussian, state, and, to, reject, the, ideas, of, the, french, revolution, which, ranke, claimed, were, meant, for, france, only, from, 1834, to, 1836, ranke, published, die, r,

of, the, papacy, in, the, 16th, century, in, this, book, ranke, coined, the, term, counter, reformation, and, offered, colorful, portrayals, of, pope, paul, iv, ignatius, of, loyola, and, pope, pius, v, he, promoted, research, into, primary, sources, i, see, the, time, approaching, when, we, shall, base, modern, history, no, longer, on, the, reports, even, of, contemporary, historians, except, insofar, as, they, had, personal, and, immediate, knowledge, of, facts, and, still, less, on, work, yet, more, remote, from, the, source, but, rather, on, the, narratives, of, eyewitnesses, and, on, genuine, and, original, documents, the, papacy, denounced, ranke, s, book, as, anti, catholic, in, contrast, many, protestants, denounced, it, as, not, anti, catholic, enough, still, historians, have, generally, praised, him, for, placing, the, situation, of, the, catholic, church, in, the, context, of, the, 16th, century, and, for, his, fair, treatment, of, the, complex, interaction, of, the, political, and, religious, issues, in, that, century, the, british, catholic, historian, lord, acton, defended, ranke, s, book, as, the, most, fair, minded, balanced, and, objective, study, ever, written, on, the, papacy, of, the, 16th, century, in, 1841, his, fame, in, its, ascendancy, ranke, was, appointed, historiographer, royal, to, the, prussian, court, in, 1845, he, became, a, member,

and, eighteenth, centuries, in, which, he, examined, the, fortunes, of, the, hohenzollern, family, and, state, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, reign, of, frederick, the, great, many, prussian, nationalists, were, offended, by, ranke, s, portrayal, of, prussia, as, a, typical, medium, sized, german, state, rather, than, as, a, great, power, from, 1852, to, 1861, ranke, published, french, history, mainly, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, 5, vols, covering, francis, i, to, louis, xiv, and, gaining, him, more, praise, for, his, impartiality, despite, being, german, in, a, series, of, lectures, given, before, future, king, maximilian, ii, of, bavaria, in, 1854, ranke, argued, that, every, age, is, next, to, god, by, which, he, meant, that, every, period, of, history, is, unique, and, must, be, understood, in, its, own, context, he, argued, that, god, gazes, over, history, in, its, totality, and, finds, all, periods, equal, ranke, rejected, the, teleological, approach, to, history, by, which, each, period, is, considered, inferior, to, the, following, period, thus, the, middle, ages, were, not, inferior, to, the, renaissance, simply, different, in, ranke, s, view, historians, had, to, understand, a, period, and, its, terms, and, seek, to, find, only, the, general, ideas, that, animated, every, period, of, history, for, ranke, history, was, not, to, be, an, account, of, man, s, progress, because, fter, plato, there, can, be, no, more, plato, ultimately, istory, is, no, criminal, court, for, ranke, christianity, was, morally, most, superior, and, could, not, be, improved, upon, when, he, wrote, zur, orientalischen, frage, gutachten, at, the, behest, of, the, kaiser, he, framed, the, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, as, primarily, religious, the, civil, rights, of, christians, against, muslims, in, the, ottoman, empire, could, only, be, secured, by, the, intervention, of, the, christian, european, nations, from, 1854, to, 1857, ranke,

edition, from, 1870, to, 1884, which, extended, his, huge, reach, even, farther, at, this, point, he, was, eighty, years, old, and, devoted, the, rest, of, his, career, to, shorter, treatises, on, german, history, that, supplement, his, earlier, writings, the, honors, poured, in, when, ranke, was, ennobled, in, 1865, appointed, a, prussian, privy, councillor, in, 1882, and, given, an, honorary, citizenship, of, berlin, in, 1885, in, 1884, he, was, appointed, the, first, honorary, member, of, the, american, historical, association, in, 1885, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, after, his, retirement, in, 1871, ranke, continued, to, write, on, a, variety, of, subjects, relating, to, german, history, such, as, the, french, revolutionary, wars, albrecht, von, wallenstein, karl, august, von, hardenberg, and, king, frederick, william, iv, of, prussia, in, 1880, ranke, began, a, huge, six, volume, work, on, world, history, which, began, with, ancient, egypt, and, the, israelites, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, berlin, in, 1886, at, the, age, of, 90, ranke, had, reached, only, the, 12th, century, but, his, assistants, later, used, his, notes, to, take, the, series, up, to, 1453, after, his, wife, died, in, 1871, ranke, became, half, blind, depending, on, assistants, to, read, to, him, a, diary, entry, from, january, 1877, contains, his, mature, thoughts, about, being, a, historian, the, proverb, tells, us, that, poets, are, born, not, only, in, the, arts, but, even, in, some, scholarly, fields, young, men, develop, into, full, bloom, or, at, least, display, their, originality, musicians, and, mathematicians, have, the, expectation, of, attaining, eminence, in, early, years, but, a, historian, must, be, old, not, only, because, of, the, immeasurable, extent, of, his, field, of, study, but, because, of, the, insight, into, the, historical, process, which, a, long, life, confers, especially, under, changing, conditions, it, would, hardly, be, bearable, for, him, to, have, only, a, short, span, of, experience, for, his, personal, development, requires, that, great, events, complete, their, course, before, his, eyes, that, others, collapse, that, new, forms, be, attempted, after, ranke, s, death, syracuse, university, purchased, his, collection, the, ranke, library, of, 25, 000, books, and, other, materials, was, ten, times, as, large, as, the, university, s, own, at, the, core, of, his, method, ranke, did, not, believe, that, general, theories, could, cut, across, time, and, space, instead, he, made, statements, about, the, time, using, quotations, from, primary, sources, saying, my, understanding, of, leading, ideas, is, simply, that, they, are, the, dominant, tendencies, in, each, century, however, these, tendencies, can, only, be, described, they, can, not, in, the, last, resort, be, summed, up, in, a, concept, ranke, objected, to, philosophy, of, history, particularly, as, practiced, by, hegel, claiming, that, hegel, ignored, the, role, of, human, agency, in, history, which, was, too, essential, to, be, characterized, through, only, one, idea, or, one, word, or, circumscribed, by, a, concept, this, lack, of, emphasis, on, unifying, theories, or, themes, led, rudolf, haym, to, denigrate, his, ideas, as, the, mindlessness, of, the, empiricist, in, the, 19th, century, ranke, s, work, was, very, popular, and, his, ideas, about, historical, practice, gradually, became, dominant, in, western, historiography, however, he, had, critics, among, his, contemporaries, including, karl, marx, a, former, hegelian, who, suggested, that, ranke, engaged, in, some, of, the, practices, he, criticized, in, other, historians, ranke, began, his, first, book, with, the, statement, in, the, introduction, that, he, would, show, the, unity, of, the, experiences, of, the, teutonic, nations, of, scandinavia, england, and, germany, and, the, latin, nations, of, italy, spain, and, france, through, the, great, respirations, of, the, v, lkerwanderung, great, migration, the, crusades, and, colonization, that, in, ranke, s, view, bound, all, of, the, nations, together, to, produce, modern, european, civilization, despite, his, opening, statement, ranke, largely, treated, all, of, the, nations, under, examination, separately, until, the, outbreak, of, the, wars, for, the, control, of, italy, starting, in, 1494, however, the, book, is, best, remembered, for, ranke, s, comment, to, history, has, been, assigned, the, office, of, judging, the, past, of, instructing, the, present, for, the, benefit, of, future, ages, to, such, high, offices, this, work, does, not, aspire, it, wants, only, to, show, what, actually, happened, wie, es, eigentlich, gewesen, ranke, s, statement, that, history, should, embrace, the, principle, of, wie, es, eigentlich, gewesen, meaning, how, things, actually, were, was, subsequently, taken, by, many, historians, as, their, guiding, principle, there, has, been, much, debate, over, the, precise, meaning, of, this, phrase, some, have, argued, that, adhering, to, the, principle, of, wie, es, eigentlich, gewesen, means, that, the, historian, should, document, facts, but, not, offer, any, interpretation, of, these, facts, following, georg, iggers, peter, novick, has, argued, that, ranke, who, was, more, of, a, romantic, and, idealist, than, his, american, contemporaries, understood, meant, instead, that, the, historian, should, discover, the, facts, and, find, the, essences, behind, them, under, this, view, the, word, eigentlich, should, be, translated, as, essentially, the, aim, then, being, to, show, what, essentially, happened, ranke, went, on, to, write, that, the, historian, must, seek, the, holy, hieroglyph, that, is, god, s, hand, in, history, keeping, an, eye, for, the, universal, whilst, taking, pleasure, in, the, particular, while, ranke, s, methods, remain, influential, in, the, practice, of, history, his, broader, ideas, of, historiography, and, empiricism, are, now, regarded, by, some, as, outdated, and, no, longer, credible, they, held, sway, among, historians, until, the, mid, 20th, century, when, they, were, challenged, by, e, h, carr, and, fernand, braudel, carr, opposed, ranke, s, ideas, of, empiricism, as, naive, boring, and, outmoded, saying, that, historians, did, not, merely, report, facts, they, choose, which, facts, they, use, braudel, s, approach, was, based, on, the, histoire, probl, me, remarking, on, the, legacy, of, ranke, s, dictum, that, historians, should, represent, the, past, wie, es, eigentlich, gewesen, as, it, actually, was, walter, benjamin, scathingly, wrote, that, it, represented, the, strongest, narcotic, of, the, century
